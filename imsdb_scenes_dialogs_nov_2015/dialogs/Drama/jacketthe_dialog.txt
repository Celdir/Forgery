WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)

I was 25 years old the first time I

died...

WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)

I remember there was so much white

everywhere. And I felt peace...even

though there was war around me. And I

felt alive, even though I knew I was

dead.

INTERN #1

Come on, come on, let's tag these

guys and get them out of here.

INTERN #2 [Reading from the TAGS]

Starks, William. Born December 25,

1966.

INTERN #1

Wait, so how old?

INTERN #2

25.

2.

INTERN #1

[Searching through records] Here he

is. William Starks. Born in Vermont.

He hasn't got a family listed. The

naval hospital'll figure out what to

do with him.

INTERN #2 [Calling out]

Oh my God! This soldier is ALIVE!

Code blue! CODE BLUE! This man just

blinked!

INTERN #1

He's been tagged already. Worry about

the others... [then seeing STARKS

blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We

need a doctor! Get a doctor over here

now!

CAPTAIN MEDLEY

The level of arms on the ground

really depends. [Answering a

question] But no, I'd have to say we

haven't had to engage on the ground

as heavily as we might have expected.

NEWSANCHOR

Have you lost any men today, Captain?

CAPTAIN MEDLEY

No. One of my Corporals took a bullet

to the head, but it looks like he

might make it. Looks that way...

FLASHBACK TO:

3.

DOCTOR

Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A

little more to the right and it

wouldn't have wanted to come out...

MAJOR

But he's never gonna be able to

remember what happened?

DOCTOR

It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks

could have retrograde amnesia

or... [lowering his voice] any form of

psychological suppression. It's very

common with traumas like this.

STARKS [Cutting him off]

Sergeant Starks is in the room,

[beat] and I want to know when I'm

going home.

LIEUTENANT

Sergeant, you have no surviving

family in the States. I'm sure you

have friends or distant relatives,

but unfortunately we have no record

of them yet.

MAJOR

Captain Medley has recommended you

for the Purple Heart, Sergeant.

4.

STARKS

Can I have one of those?

LIEUTENANT

Of course.

DOCTOR

There is help for you, Sergeant.

LIEUTENANT

Of course there is.

STARKS [V.O.]

I didn't know where my home was. I

just knew I didn't want to be there

anymore.

JACKIE

Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...

STARKS

You two ok?

JACKIE

Our car won't start.

5.

STARKS [Looking at JEAN]

What's your mom's name?

JACKIE [Cautiously]

Jean.

STARKS

Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need

you to try to wake up, Jean.

STARKS

Your mom take anything before this

happened?

JACKIE

Yeah, but I don't know what.

STARKS

[Beat] What's your name?

JACKIE

Jackie.

STARKS

Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't

you wrap this scarf around yourself

and try to keep your mom awake while

I take a look at your car.

STARKS

What do you think of all this snow?

JACKIE

[Beat] Nothing.

6.

JACKIE

But I like it I guess.

STARKS

Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?

JACKIE

Yeah.

STARKS

Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing

it.

JACKIE [Smiling]

It works!

JEAN

Get your fucking hands off my

daughter!

JACKIE

Mom, he just fixed our car.

JEAN

Jackie, get in the car. NOW!

JEAN

Look, I don't want any trouble, so...

STARKS

Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my

way.

JACKIE

Mom, you've got it wrong...

JACKIE

You're just gonna walk?

7.

STARKS

Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.

[Beat] Let her throw it all up before

she gets back behind the wheel.

JACKIE

What're those?

STARKS

Dog tags. [Off her blank look]

They've got your name and date of

birth for identification.

JACKIE

What for?

STARKS

[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't

remember who you are.

JACKIE [Still looking at them]

Hm.

STARKS

I think I can remember what's on

them.

JACKIE

William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

"Jackie" and "Jean" are the only

...things you know for certain about

that day?

8.

VOICE (O.S.)

Are you aware we have no last name,

no place of residence, and no record

of any physical presence for these

"friends" of yours? How's that

possible in this day and age?

VOICE (O.S.)

I may need to actually hear that

answer, Mr. Starks.

STARKS

[Beat] Yes.

OFFICER NASH [Emotional]

Eddie [correcting himself], Officer

Harrison, was lying in a pool of his

own blood -- on his back.

DR. HALE

William Starks could be blocking the

incident. It would explain his well-

systematized scheme about the little

girl and her mother. A delusion as

complex as that can often replace the

reality of an incident like this.

OFFICER NASH [Cont'd]

Officer Harrison'd been shot three

times. He was long dead by the time

we got there.

9.

DR. HALE

I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome.

The medical community is only

beginning to gather information about

it.

PROSECUTION

Gulf War   Syndrome? What the...Why

don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life

Syndrome   while we're at it? I've

gotten a   lot of convictions we could

overturn   with that logic...

CAPTAIN MEDLEY

Sergeant Starks was awarded the

Purple Heart. That award doesn't

applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It

applauds honor.

DR. HALE [Cont'd]

His subconscious is blocking it, the

same way it began to in the Gulf,

particularly as something similarly

traumatizing happened to him then.

PROSECUTION [Disdainfully]

It's not a question of whether or not

he was sane when he did it?! He

absolutely was. Three bullets in one

man are three moral failings in

another.

CAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed]

War isn't a CNN Special. Half the

shit that went on couldn't be tidied

into a top of the hour headline --

either 'cause it couldn't be said

neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said

at all. It was ugly. And they don't

put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks]

If Starks did kill that officer

... [Beat] You can't hold a man

responsible for a damaged mind.

10.

DEFENSE

For God's sake, my client said he

thinks he's already died once. He

doesn't know what's going on.

FLASHBACK TO:

STARKS [V.O., nearly whispered]

I don't know how it happened.

JURY FOREMAN

On the count of first degree murder,

we find the defendant, William

Starks, not guilty by reason of

insanity.

JUDGE (O.S.)

I hereby sentence you to be committed

to a facility for the criminally

insane, where I hope that doctors and

the proper treatment can help you...

11.

JUDGE [O.S.]

Mr. Starks, I hope that someday you

might be well so that we will have

lost only one life in this tragedy.

CHIEF OF STAFF

I'd certainly say he should be

considered violent, just given his

case...

DR. BECKER

How'd he dodge a conviction?

CHIEF OF STAFF

His defense argued post-traumatic

stress and delusional disorder. He

evidently couldn't account for a

similar incident during his service

in Desert Storm.

DR. BECKER

[Beat] So why isn't he just in the

psych ward of the county jail?

CHIEF OF STAFF

Apparently, he's a decorated vet. And

had another one testify for him. Who

knows? [To DR. BECKER] Tom, do you

mind taking him?

12.

BECKER

William? William, can you hear me?

BECKER

I've given you some drugs to help

with your adjustment...

STARKS [Cutting him off]

What kind of drugs? [Beat] 'Cause

these seem pretty...pretty serious.

BECKER

Well, your condition's pretty

serious.

STARKS

[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's

steady gaze] What?

BECKER

I'm just looking at you. Does that

make you uncomfortable?

STARKS

Depends on what you're seeing.

BECKER

You said you couldn't remember

killing Officer Harrison. Correct?

STARKS

[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?

13.

BECKER

It's not my job to believe you.

STARKS [Squinting to better see]

You're a doctor. I would think...

BECKER [Cutting him off firmly]

It's not my job to believe you or to

understand you. It's my job to try to

cure you and if that's a no-go, then

to...take some kind of care of you.

STARKS [Flatly]

Lucky me.

BECKER [Stupefied]

You shot a man three times: first in

his heart, then in his stomach and

then...point blank, in the back of

his head. And then you just...forgot

all about it. A whole life erased

with three easy little words: I.

Don't. Know. What would it be if we

could all not know what we didn't

want to have to face.

FADE TO:

STARKS [Softly]

I don't belong here. I don't...

14.

STARKS [Mumbling]

I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm

sorry. I didn't mean it.

STARKS [Forced to yell]

Will you listen to me? I'm not going

to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean

to bump...I'm sorry.

BECKER

It's ok, Harold. It's ok.

STARKS [To Becker]

I don't belong here...

BECKER [Angrily, to the ORDERLIES]

Get him to his room.

FADE TO BLACK.

NURSE HARDING

Come on, army boy. Time for some

therapy.

15.

STARKS

Wait. Wait a minute... Please.

STARKS

I, I don't belong here.

BECKER

No. I don't think you do either.

[Beat] But neither of us can do

anything about that.

16.

1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it,

spilling from...

2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last

breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH...

3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him.

1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS

stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes

from...

2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one...

3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her

hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its

blood on her face just before she lies back down among

the dead, content to be one of them.

17.

FADE TO BLACK.

SMASH CUT TO:

BECKER

Take him out of it.

BECKER

William. William, can you hear me?

18.

DR. GRIES [Less muffled]

Pulse is 16, temp, just a hair under

90. 'Bout right for three hours of

psychosis.

NURSE HARDING

That's not enough, is it?

BECKER [Wearily, indifferently]

It's enough for now. Take him to the

infirmary and let him recover there.

STARKS [Getting up to help him]

Let's get you a destination other

than this wall.

MACKENZIE

That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears

us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to

bother answering so he makes us think

he can't talk. I know. I tried it on

my mother for two months once before

she fished out my tongue. Literally.

[Beat] You're the cop killer, right?

STARKS

Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?

MACKENZIE

TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy

gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking

out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.

(MORE)

19.

MACKENZIE (cont'd)

Welcome to the village, William

Starks.

STARKS [Looking away]

I'm not really in the mood to talk.

MACKENZIE

That's too bad. I don't believe in

disposable language either -- you

know, the small talk, the little

talk. Chit. Chat. Useless. The game's

something else though. Think about

it: What can we trade with each other

in the air between us? This...

[running his hand through the air] is

our court. [Beat, so eager it's sad]

I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

STARKS [Relenting]

What are you in here for?

MACKENZIE

I tried to kill my wife.

STARKS

Don't you go to jail for that?

MACKENZIE

I tried something like 30 times.

MACKENZIE

She's bigger than me, and she's

stronger than me. And I never planned

on doing it. It was always in the

heat of the moment. I didn't beat her

or anything. Hell, she beat me. But

when we'd start fighting, I'd go for

the knife. Then she kept threatening

to have me put away, and [looking

around] she finally did.

20.

STARKS

Yeah, well 30 times probably would

make you seem crazy.

MACKENZIE

Or just plain stupid. You'd think by

the twentieth time, I'd have found an

alternative method. Maybe a more

effective one, if you know what I

mean.

DR. LORENSON

Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing

today?

MACKENZIE

It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson.

[Finally turns to face her, grimly]

The world around me, it's shrinking.

There's not even room for light to

make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da-

da-bum! I feel like the horseman of

doom is coming for me, Doc. Only

today, he's not carrying flowers.

MACKENZIE

What? It's better than fine.

DR. LORENSON

And you, Mr. Starks?

STARKS [Already on the defense]

I'm fine.

DR. LORENSON

Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could

talk to Mr. Starks privately?

MACKENZIE

Of course you can, Doc. William, it

was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for

playing.

21.

MACKENZIE

Hey...when they talk you out to the

woods tonight and invite the wolves,

dance with them. [Beat] They don't

eat you when there's music playing.

DR. LORENSON

So you're ok?

STARKS [Still distracted]

What?

DR. LORENSON

I asked you if you're ok.

STARKS [Suspiciously]

I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You

think there's anything wrong with me?

DR. LORENSON

I don't know. You're not my patient.

DR. LORENSON

You look like you've lost some

weight. Are you eating?

STARKS

I am. One of the few things I

remember doing is eating. So I guess

I must be exercising it off in my

dreams.

STARKS

You done with your small talk?

DR. LORENSON

Sure.

STARKS

Good.

22.

DAMON

I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen

you coming there.

DAMON [Leaning down close to him]

Were you worried about me? [Smiling]

That's so sweet. Thanks.

NURSE HARDING

You gonna get the fuck up?

BECKER

I'm glad to see you're cooperating

this time, Mr. Starks.

23.

DR. GRIES

Hold him while I get the

tranquilizer.

DAMON

Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot.

BECKER

No. That's not necessary.

BECKER

Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let

him go!

24.

BECKER [An inch away from his face]

What, Starks? What are you going to

do? End me just because I'm an

inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just

like you did with Officer Harrison?

BECKER

The only thing your mind is missing

is a conscience.

DR. GRIES

Wait...Dr. Becker, how long do you

want us to leave him in for?

DR. GRIES

Just strap him in for now.

DR. GRIES

You ok?

BECKER

I'm fine.

DR. GRIES

[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother

you...

BECKER

Then don't.

25.

DR. GRIES

But... what about Starks?

BECKER

What about Starks?

DR. GRIES

Should we be...

BECKER

Should we be what? Trying to change

him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.

DR. GRIES

But the Jacket? I mean...should we be

leaving him in like that?

BECKER [As if stunned by the question]

Leaving him in? [Beat] The medication

I'm given him is intended to adjust --

maybe even reset -- his violent

proclivities. You know, peel away

some of those layers of hate. The

Jacket's merely a safe place for that

to happen. The grounds and the halls --

where I can't monitor side effects I

can't predict -- aren't.

DR. GRIES [Still doubtful]

But, but...what about...

BECKER [Mocking Gries]

But...but what about the gun? I mean,

should he have been firing away like

that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You

can't fuck up a life that's already

been fucked up. [Turning away] There,

there's the insurance you're looking

for.

DR. GRIES

I'm not looking for anything.

BECKER

[Beat] It's Christmas Eve, Justin.

Don't you have somewhere to be?

26.

CUT TO:

NURSE HARDING

Ah, man, look, It's A Wonderful Life.

DAMON

You got any booze?

NURSE HARDING

'Course I do. [Smiling] And it is the

season for giving so let's get to it.

27.

MACKENZIE (O.S.)

When they take you out to the woods

tonight and invite the wolves, dance

with them.

MACKENZIE (O.S.)

They don't eat you when there's music

playing.

1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK and a small child's HAND

2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME)

3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH

4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water, not too deep...

5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH

6) EXT. DESERT, IRAQ: A sublime sunset...

CUT TO:

28.

WAITRESS

Where do you think you're going?

WAITRESS

You gonna answer me?

WAITRESS

If you're deaf, read my lips...I

don't need a psycho following me

today.

STARKS

[Beat] I'm not deaf.

WAITRESS

Good.

29.

WAITRESS

[As if she owes him an explanation] I

forgot my purse.

WAITRESS

In case you hadn't figured, it's

Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get

a cab here.

STARKS

[Beat] Thanks.

WAITRESS

All right. [Beat] You got somewhere

you need to go, Mister?

STARKS

I'm not sure.

WAITRESS

Let me ask you that again. This time,

look around and consider your

options.

WAITRESS

[Beat] You got somewhere you need to

go, Mister?

STARKS [Nodding slowly]

Yeah, I do.

30.

WAITRESS

Great, get in.

WAITRESS

So, where do you want me to drop you?

STARKS

I'm not sure.

WAITRESS

You don't have anywhere to stay?

STARKS

I don't think so.

WAITRESS

Well, where are you from?

STARKS

I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really

know.

WAITRESS

Of course you don't know.

STARKS

Why "of course"?

WAITRESS

Because in my life, it wouldn't make

sense for me to pick up some normal

guy with a place where he's from and

a place where he's going to. It'd be

too simple. I probably wouldn't know

how to handle a situation like that.

STARKS

Well, you definitely didn't pick

normal or simple this time either.

31.

WAITRESS

At least you're honest. That's some

kind of start.

WAITRESS

That's great. You're not sure where

you're from or where you're going,

but at least you've got manners.

WAITRESS

Well, you got a coat or something?

STARKS [Looking down at his clothes]

No. Doesn't look like it.

WAITRESS

Well, how'd you get here?

STARKS

[Beat] I was dropped off.

WAITRESS

Do you have a motel or something?

Money?

STARKS

No.

WAITRESS

Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff?

Belongings?

STARKS

No. [Beat] Not around here.

WAITRESS

All right, we'll get to my place and

call around, see where I can take

you. [Beat] Just don't think of

trying anything.

(MORE)

32.

WAITRESS (cont'd)

I have the biggest defense for gun

control living upstairs from me.

She's armed and angry even when she's

asleep.

WAITRESS [Pleading tone]

I could have him there in 15 minutes.

[Beat, disappointed] Hmm. Yeah,

thanks. Merry Christmas to you, too.

WAITRESS

Great. That was our last option. What

am I going to do with you?

STARKS

Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for

bringing me this far.

WAITRESS

Where are you going? You'll freeze

out there. You don't even have a

coat.

STARKS

I'll manage.

WAITRESS

No, you won't. You'll die of cold out

there and then I'll have to feel

guilty. And I've already got more

guilt than I know what to do with.

[Beat] Do you want something to

drink?

STARKS

No, I'm ok.

WAITRESS

Shit! That was one of my good

glasses!

33.

WAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken]

Hey, you ok?

STARKS

[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.

WAITRESS

You know what? It's Christmas Eve.

And you look clean -- I mean, you're

normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her

own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and

I have a couch.

STARKS

I'm not gonna hurt you.

WAITRESS [Softly]

I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm

gonna go take a bath. Make yourself

at home. You know, fix yourself

something to eat if you're hungry or

anything. There's nothing to steal,

but don't be a jerk and take

something anyway. And don't snoop,

ok?

STARKS

Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the

way.

WAITRESS [Shakes her head]

No, no. Let's not do the name stuff,

'cause you see, I don't want to meet

you. I may want to help you tonight,

but I don't want to know you. Honest.

34.

WAITRESS

What's this?

STARKS

The best I could do with what was in

your fridge.

STARKS

I only lit it because it was so cold

in here. I'm sorry if...

WAITRESS

No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow]

Thanks.

WAITRESS

You want a drink?

STARKS

Sure.

WAITRESS

This is pretty good. Considering...

35.

STARKS

Thanks.

STARKS

So you're a waitress, right? I

mean...from the uniform you were

wearing.

WAITRESS

Yup. That's me.

STARKS

You like it?

WAITRESS

[Beat] I do it.

STARKS

Have you always been a waitress?

WAITRESS [Remembering sadly]

No. I used to be a nurse.

STARKS

[Beat] Why'd you stop?

WAITRESS

Shit happens, and your life changes.

'Bout the best explanation of a lot

of things that happen. [Beat] So how

come you don't know where you're

coming from?

STARKS

I don't know, but I think part of

it's...

STARKS

That I don't really know what's real.

WAITRESS

Well, good for you.

STARKS

[Beat] Why?

36.

WAITRESS

[Beat] Real is overrated.

STARKS

You don't think that's crazy?

WAITRESS

Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.

WAITRESS

Sometimes I don't know the difference

myself. And, you know something? I

think I like it better that way.

[Finishes her drink] You want another

one?

BOB DYLAN

If you go when the snow flakes storm

When the rivers freeze and summer

ends.

Please see she has a coat so warm

To keep her from the howlin' winds...

37.

STARKS

This is a great song.

WAITRESS

You remember it?

STARKS [Nodding slowly]

It's like I feel like...I know who I

am. I just can't remember anything

that made me this person.

STARKS

But hey, who can forget those words?

The man just wants simple and good

things for his woman -- that she be

warm and happy. How hard can that be

to remember?

WAITRESS

May be easy to remember, but not easy

to get. Being warm, maybe -- but,

look, you don't even have a coat and

I still have to chop wood to make a

fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you

tell me if that's simple.

WAITRESS [re: the lights]

Why don't I try to get them to stop

blinking?

STARKS

They told me I joined the army when I

was seventeen. That's when my father

died and, before that, it was

apparently just me and him since I

was born 'cause my mom split.

WAITRESS

So you never knew your mother?

STARKS

I guess not. But, as of now, I never

knew either.

38.

WAITRESS

I'm sorry.

STARKS

Yeah. [Beat] How about you?

WAITRESS

Never knew my father. I grew up with

my mother. Actually, I grew up around

my mother. She was great though. I

mean, the way she was with her

friends... She was this woman who had

so much life in her, she had to find

ways to kill some of it just to be

like the rest of us. [Beat] She died

young.

STARKS

How?

WAITRESS

She fucked herself up day after day

and then, one day, she fell asleep

with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I

came home from work and she was gone.

STARKS

I'm sorry.

WAITRESS

Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for

the last ten years.

STARKS

That when you stopped being a nurse?

WAITRESS [Exhausted]

Yeah, that's when I stopped being a

nurse. I never thought I could stop

being one, I wanted it for so long,

but... you just can't do it anymore

when you lose someone like that. You

can't take care of other people.

39.

DR. GRIES

William, can you hear me?

40.

STARKS

Jackie? Jackie?

JACKIE

Hm...

STARKS [Swallowing, softly]

Jackie? [Beat] What year is it?

JACKIE [In a drunken slumber]

What?

STARKS

What year is it?

JACKIE [Barely opening her eyes]

2004.

FADE TO:

41.

STARKS [O.S., echoing distantly]

Jackie? [Beat] What year is it?

JACKIE [Desperately]

Who are you?

STARKS

[Beat] I'm William Starks.

JACKIE

Get the hell out of my house!

JACKIE

What'd you do? Snoop all over the

place? You had no right. You had no

right to go through anything.

STARKS

[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense.

It doesn't even make sense to me.

42.

JACKIE

If you don't get out of my house

right now, I'll call the police.

STARKS [Remembering]

Your mom was passed out on the side

of the road when I found you. Her

name was Jean. [Beat] She was dizzy

the whole time...

JACKIE [Trembling]

Why would you do something like this?

I tried to help you.

STARKS

Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can

prove it.

JACKIE

What? Now you're gonna show me some

kind of driver's license?

STARKS

No, I don't have anything to show

you. I'm here from a mental hospital.

JACKIE

Well, you belong in one.

STARKS [Solemnly]

[Beat] You and your mom were in a

truck and she kept a rifle in the

back of it...

JACKIE

Stop it! Stop it!

STARKS

I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat]

but I'm not lying to you.

JACKIE

You can't be William Starks. He's

dead.

STARKS

[Beat] What?

43.

JACKIE

William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've

been to his grave.

STARKS

[Beat] What?

JACKIE

His body was found New Year's Day,

19...1993. At Alpine...

STARKS [Finishing for her]

Alpine Grove. That's the mental

hospital. How do you know that?

JACKIE

I looked it up.

STARKS

How?

STARKS

I gave you my dog tags.

JACKIE

No, you didn't. They found William

Starks' body dead in the snow.

STARKS

How'd he die?

JACKIE

I don't know. But he did die.

JACKIE

I know what this is...I picked you up

when I was drunk and you probably

thought I'm just fucked up enough to

fall for this. But the thing is I

know what I'm doing when I drink. I

just usually don't care. Right now, I

do though. And I want you out. Now.

44.

STARKS

It's December 25th, 1993 today.

JACKIE

No, it's not. [Beat] It's December

25th, 2004.

STARKS [Desperate]

That can't be. That's...just, I

mean... You're telling me I died in

less than a week in the time I'm in.

JACKIE

I'm telling you I don't care what

time you think you're in. You're not

William Starks. [Beat] I don't

believe in many things, but I believe

in death. And it doesn't give back

what it takes. So whoever you are...I

did a nice thing, you've made me

regret it enough already, so please,

just leave.

STARKS

I'll leave. But look at me. Look at

my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met

you and your mother. I told you then

that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There

was no one for miles around so I know

you know there's no way I could have

known that from a pair of dog tags

you had lying around.

JACKIE

Please...

JACKIE

Happy Birthday.

45.

MEDLEY

You walk on. They pick up their guns

and fire at you, you stay. They pick

up and fire at each other, and you

walk on!

STARKS

He's got his gun pointed at a kid.

MEDLEY

That is not our problem.

STARKS

Yeah, well, none of this is our

fuckin' problem.

MEDLEY

We are leaving this site right now.

STARKS [To the first Iraqi soldier]

Hey!

46.

FADE TO BLACK.

BECKER

You left him in all night?

NURSE HARDING

Shit, he's probably dead.

DR. GRIES [Defensively]

I tried to ask you if we should leave

him in yesterday...

BECKER

Don't get all worked up, Justin. I

expected some common sense on your

part and clearly I was expecting too

much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.

DR. GRIES

We never should have done this to

him...

BECKER

Well, what are we gonna do about it now?

DR. GRIES

Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead?

47.

BECKER

No. [To Harding and Damon] Get him

upstairs.

LORENSON

Where's William Starks.

NURSE

I'm not sure. Dr. Becker had him

moved.

LORENSON [Calling out after him]

Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait!

LORENSON [Out of breath]

Where's William Starks?

BECKER

He's recovering on the third floor.

LORENSON

Are you kidding me? He's not

psychotic!

BECKER

Then how would you describe him,

Beth? Merely rebellious?

LORENSON

He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom.

His behavior's hardly suggested he

needed neuroleptics.

48.

BECKER

And you know that from what, a couple

two-minute stares across a room?

LORENSON [Firmly]

He didn't need anti-psychotics, if

that's even all you're giving him...?

BECKER [Steadily]

After he slashed me with a hospital

instrument, I determined, in my

professional opinion, that Mr.

Starks, needed a little placating.

LORENSON

[Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked?

BECKER

You sure you want to begin making

that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I

took five stitches during a routine

therapy session.

LORENSON

I'm sure he took some, too.

BECKER [Smirking, unphased]

Happens sometimes when you've got to

restrain them. You watch the rest of

us work. You know that.

LORENSON [Appealing to him]

Our patients are sick.

BECKER

Yes, they are.

LORENSON

He's not gonna end up like Casey,

Tom. Whatever happened to him is not

going to "happen" to Starks. I don't

know what you're trying to do here

...but he's not a lab animal, Tom.

You can't reprogram him no matter the

drugs or the treatment.

49.

BECKER

Jesus, you really don't let up, do

you? Just because you failed your

patient doesn't necessarily mean the

rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to

tarnish your war hero's image, but he

is psychotic.

BECKER

Now, if you'll excuse me, it's

Christmas, and I have a family I'd

like to see.

CLAIRE [Not looking up]

How can I help you?

JACKIE

Hi, Claire.

CLAIRE

Jackie, hi. How are you, honey?

JACKIE

I'm ok. [Beat] I need a favor.

CUT TO:

50.

RETURN TO:

"ALPINE GROVE INVESTIGATION into the mysterious death of

William Starks..."

"The body of WILLIAM STARKS, the former war hero who was

charged with the murder of OFFICER EDWARD HARRISON, was

found on the grounds of ALPINE GROVE on January 1, 1993.

STARKS was believed to have died from a wound to the

head."

"Local Doctor charged with medical malpractice." "Dr.

Thomas Becker resigns..." "It involved the recreation of

a womb-like environment." "Former patients testify to

being put in instrument known as the 'Jacket'"...

"Patient Rudy MacKenzie testifies..."

"WILLIAM STARKS, laurelled war hero..."

"Local Boy, Eugene Yazdi, Overcomes Absence Seizure

Syndrome to Win Mathematic Decathlon...with the aid of

Local Doctor, Dr. Loel Lorenson." "Panelists for

National Epilepsy Conference include Dr. Lorenson,

Alpine Grove Hospital."

STARKS

What the hell kind of drugs are you

people giving me?

51.

BECKER [O.S.]

Just something to help you sleep.

STARKS [Swallowing nervously]

Did you say something?

BECKER

I said the drugs were to help you

sleep. [Beat] Did you sleep well?

STARKS [Doubtfully]

But I wasn't asleep. Was I?

BECKER

Yes. You were. You were asleep for

nearly a whole day. It's December

26th, William.

STARKS

It's December 26th?

BECKER

That's right, William.

STARKS [Slowly figuring it out]

1992?

52.

BECKER

Yes. [Caustically] And that's the sun

and you're on earth. [Beat] And I

know you know better.

STARKS

I don't know better. All I know is

that you left me in there.

BECKER

In where?

STARKS

[Uncertainly] In that thing...the

Jacket.

BECKER

We were forced to use restrains if

that's what you're referring to.

STARKS

That wasn't a fucking restraint.

BECKER

Actually, that's exactly what our

equipment is.

BECKER

Relax.

STARKS

Don't act like I don't know what's

real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's

crazy here.

BECKER

[Pointedly] Of course you're not.

53.

BECKER

You're just suffering from delusions

that are unfortunately part of your

condition.

STARKS

Don't give me that. I know what's

real, goddamnit! You strapped me in

something and stuck me in a drawer.

STARKS

I didn't dream it. I may have been

asleep but it wasn't a dream.

BECKER

I had a patient a few years ago. His

name was Ted Casey...

STARKS

I don't give a shit about your

patient!

BECKER

I wasn't pausing to see if you did.

[Beat] But, incidentally, you should,

because you're birds of a feather.

BECKER

Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year

old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me

to have a look at him because, after

his deeds were done... he climbed

into the trees of the forest where he

killed her and woofed like a dog. He

couldn't even remember his name when

I spoke to him, but, curiously

enough, he could speak back. [Beat]

Ted never went to prison because

everyone -- including me -- was

convinced he was sick. So he came

here.

54.

BECKER

Then one day a little girl came with

her mother to visit a relative and I

caught Ted stealing looks at her --

the kind you really have to steal if

you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked

Ted then if he could remember what

the little girl who he had... slain

...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a

look I'll never forget, and, when he

answered, it wasn't with a color or

any sort of physical description I'd

expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember

it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those

were actually his last words I think.

STARKS

We are not birds of a feather.

BECKER

Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think

you're in a tree... woofing like a

dog. And I'm just trying to help you

the only way I can think of.

STARKS [Provokingly]

What happened to your cheek, Dr.

Becker?

BECKER

I was careless. Happens sometimes.

FADE TO:

55.

JACKIE [O.S.]

They found William Starks' body dead

in the snow.

STARKS [O.S.]

How'd he die?

JACKIE [O.S.]

I don't know. But he did die.

LORENSON

Hey. You're not supposed to be out

here.

STARKS [Turning around sharply]

What are you going to do to me?

LORENSON

Well...

56.

LORENSON [Nonchalantly]

I thought I'd just ask you to come

back inside with me.

STARKS

And if I didn't want to come?

LORENSON

I guess I'd ask you why.

STARKS

Because I don't think I'm crazy.

LORENSON

You're not crazy.

LORENSON

You suffer from delusional disorder.

That doesn't mean you're... crazy. It

just means you're confused. And

you're here, instead of in jail,

because that was determined to have

played a role in your killing of a

police officer.

STARKS [Correcting him]

Alleged killing of a police officer.

LORENSON

You were convicted of the crime.

STARKS

That conviction doesn't convince me

of anything. Until I know that I did

it, I'm not going to accept that I

did.

LORENSON

You may never remember at all. [Beat]

Your mind's grasp of reality and the

real events that have happened to you

has been damaged.

STARKS

No. The real events that have

happened to me have been fucked up.

Not my mind.

57.

LORENSON

[Beat] William, I'd like to ask you

something if I can.

STARKS

Since when do people around here have

to ask permission to do anything?

LORENSON [Suspiciously]

How's your treatment progressing with

Dr. Becker?

STARKS

Fine. [Beat] Why made you ask?

LORENSON [Carefully]

I just hope you'd let me know if that

wasn't the case.

STARKS

Why, what would you do?

LORENSON

I could try to...make it stop.

STARKS

No. I don't want it to.

LORENSON

So it's helping?

STARKS [Choosing his words carefully]

[Beat] It's making me feel like a

different person.

LORENSON [Casually]

You comin'?

58.

LORENSON

You should be careful. You could be

killed if they found you out here.

STARKS

Believe me, I know.

STARKS

What were you talking about the other

day?

MACKENZIE

I wasn't talking about anything.

STARKS

Yeah, you were. What you said about

them taking me out to the woods...

STARKS

What do you know about the Jacket?

MACKENZIE

I know you need one when it's really

cold.

STARKS

[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me.

Listen. I'm going to die.

MACKENZIE

Mortality's actually a great thing to

be familiar with. It means you're

sane on some level.

STARKS

[Gravely] No, I mean in four days,

I'm supposed to die.

MACKENZIE

[Beat] How do you know?

STARKS

The Jacket.

59.

MACKENZIE

Oh no, you're pretty young. Your

body'll be able to handle a lot more

of it than you think...

STARKS

No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I

was in it that my body's gonna be

found in four days.

HARDING

What are you two yappin' about?

MACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut]

[Beat] We're talking about our

ability to go forward in time, to go

into the future. [To Starks] That is

what we're talking about here, right?

STARKS

Yeah, it is.

HARDING

You know something? You're two

fucking freaks is what you are.

STARKS [Smiling]

Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you

think we're doing in this place?

HARDING

I want the two of you to shut the

fuck up and eat your food.

STARKS [Under his breath]

I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie.

60.

MACKENZIE

It's gonna be sticky.

STARKS

Why?

MACKENZIE

'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it

now. When she started getting

suspicious about me was when they

stopped using it on me. Women!

STARKS

So what am I supposed to do?

MACKENZIE

You could still always give Becker an

itch. 'Course you might get killed

when he goes to scratch it, but seems

to me you're saying that's about to

happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful

not to walk yourself right into

something.

DR. GRIES

We're late.

LORENSON

I wish they'd skip the formality of

this annual review and just cut our

budget. Our silence on the matter

should be enough to appease the civic

conscience without wasting an hour we

don't have.

DR. GRIES

Maybe it's not such a waste.

LORENSON

It's the ticking of a box on a sheet

of paper no one cares about.

61.

DR. GRIES

They don't care about all the things

we do right. [Beat] But they might

...they might care about what we're

doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they

should come here to look for.

LORENSON

What should they be looking for?

DR. GRIES

They should just be looking harder.

LORENSON

Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it?

He's doing stuff, isn't he?

DR. GRIES

Later. I'll tell you about it later.

We got a session to catch now.

62.

STARKS [To Sally]

You ok?

SALLY

Are you ok?

STARKS

Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone?

Where is everyone?

SALLY [Defensively]

There's a state rep visiting so

they've moved everyone around. But

I've been alone before...

STARKS

Where are the other orderlies?

SALLY

In the therapy session downstairs.

That's what the rep's sitting in

on...

STARKS

Ok, listen. I want you to get out of

here and lock the door behind you.

I'll go get some doctors.

63.

STARKS [Calling out]

Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker.

BECKER

Mr. Starks, this session is for our

civil patients. Damon, please take

Mr. Starks back to his ward.

STARKS [Derisively]

No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap

me in a Jacket or even gag me, but

please don't leave me out of therapy.

This is where I feel like I make the

most progress.

BECKER

Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a

chair for yourself.

BECKER

Mr. Jensen, please continue.

JENSEN

Well, [beat] I've been approached by

the Federal Trade Organization.

64.

BECKER [Calm as ever]

And what have they approached you

about, Mr. Jensen?

JENSEN

They want me to head the Organization

for the Organized.

BECKER

The Organization...for the Organized?

JENSEN

That's right. Have you heard of them?

BECKER

No, Mr. Jensen. I have not.

GROUP PATIENT 2

That's because there is no such

Organization, you idiot.

JENSEN

That is categorically not true. Bl-bl-

blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE.

I've been asked to lead them. But, if

you'd heard of them, then they

wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?

BECKER [Wearily]

What do the rest of you think?

STARKS [Loud and emphatic]

Well, [beat] I know they exist.

BECKER

And how is that?

STARKS

When I was in the Gulf, the

Organization was recruiting the

Organized.

65.

BECKER [Incensed]

Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because

if it's not, it doesn't help Mr.

Jensen.

STARKS [Looking right at Jensen]

It is a fact. Bona fide, and

classified.

JENSEN

I knew it! I knew it! Those little

fuckers are everywhere.

STARKS

They recruit only the best, Mr.

Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have

to say this...

STARKS

But these people [pointing to the

Doctors] know about it. In fact, when

Presidents of this country and heads

of state leave office, they come

here, to Alpine Grove. They're among

us right now! [Looking right at

Becker] Isn't that right, Dr.

Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they

picked you.

STARKS

They're always ordering us to stay

calm, but how can we be calm?

STARKS

[Looking suddenly directly at Becker]

All they do is give orders. That's

all they have to do. And no one will

ever know. All it comes down to is an

order. [Beat] They've got hands

everywhere.

66.

STARKS

Long live the Organization for the

Organized!

BECKER

Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr.

Starks!

BECKER

Sit down, Mr. Jensen!

RANDOM PATIENTS

Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker!

CUT TO:

DAMON

Starks, you're like a mule. You're

real stubborn. But there's ways of

fixin' that. All you need is a good

stick. [Beat] Here's your stick.

67.

TENNY

You ever been to jail?

STARKS

No.

TENNY

It's worse than war. It's worse than

anywhere you've ever been.

STARKS

I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think

prison's so bad you don't want to

remember it...

TENNY

Well, I've never been to war, but I'm

sure as hell not going back to

prison.

STARKS [Finally spotting Harrison]

What's he pulling us over for?

TENNY [Still preparing himself]

Recreation.

OFFICER HARRISON

Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step

out of the car, with your hands at

your side please.

STARKS

Why?

68.

OFFICER HARRISON [Sternly]

Step out of the car.

STARKS

Ok, sir. I was just asking what for.

OFFICER HARRISON

This is a stolen vehicle you're

driving. Now put your hands in the

air, out where I can see 'em.

STARKS

Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?

TENNY

Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you

ain't even worth a fucking bullet.

FADE TO BLACK.

69.

JACKIE

I'll be off in 15 minutes. Can you

wait till then?

JACKIE

The Jacket. That's what they call it,

right?

STARKS

Yeah.

JACKIE

It was banned, you know... and it led

to an investigation of Dr. Becker's

mistreatment of some of his patients.

That's when they found out how badly

he was drugging his patients...

STARKS [Starting to make sense]

So he was giving me all kinds of

drugs...

JACKIE [Nodding]

Apparently. He was taking a lot of

them, too. It said he was trying out

behavior modification treatments that

were banned back in the 70s -- "womb

treatment" is the name he gave to

what he did to you...

STARKS [Cutting in]

Womb? A fuckin' womb? What kind of

animal did he come out of?

JACKIE

But no one knew until after...

STARKS

After I...

70.

JACKIE

[Beat] You bled to death.

STARKS

What?

JACKIE

I don't know how you got the cut to

your head, but you died bleeding from

it.

STARKS [Digesting]

And you're sure my body was found on

January 1st?

STARKS

Do you really believe me?

JACKIE

I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was

crazy after you left that day. I died.

I still think I could be crazy. But

then I replayed that night in my head --

the parts of it I could remember --

and it was like...I don't care if I

was, or am. I haven't felt that way

in a room with someone my whole life.

[Beat] And when you left, all I

wanted was...

JACKIE

[Softly] I want to trust you. Should

I trust you?

STARKS

Yes.

JACKIE

Then we need to figure out what

happened to you. It's the only thing

we can do.

STARKS

I know.

71.

JACKIE

Alpine Grove still exists. I looked

it up on the net. We should go there

and see if there's still anyone

around who might have known what

happened to you.

STARKS

If they don't take me out before

then. [As an afterthought] What's the

net?

STARKS

I didn't kill Officer Harrison.

JACKIE

I know.

STARKS

How? Did they figure it out after I

died?

JACKIE

No. They never figured it out. I did.

Most murderers don't stop to help a

drunk woman and her little girl on

the side of the road. Not without

hurting them.

DR. MORGAN

I'm sorry I can't tell you more about

your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our

own medical examiners determined only

that he died from a blunt trauma to

the head but that was right around

the time the Alpine Grove's staff

changed and I'm afraid we didn't have

the best record system before then.

72.

STARKS

His body was found on January 1,

1993, but do you know if that was

long after he had died?

DR. MORGAN

No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew

more.

STARKS

What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr.

Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr.

Gries, I think.

DR. MORGAN

Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at

the hospital. If she was here at the

time your father was, then I'm sure

she'd be of more help to you.

STARKS

What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?

DR. MORGAN

Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with

Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away

three, four years ago.

JACKIE

Do you have any kind of forwarding

address for Dr. Becker?

DR. MORGAN

Your father was here 12 years ago. I

doubt the hospital would have that,

if Dr. Becker is still even alive.

[Beat, a little suspiciously] Is

there a particular reason you need

to know how your father died?

STARKS

He was the only family I remember.

DR. MORGAN [Nodding]

I'll see what I can find out about

Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson

will know something.

73.

DR. MORGAN

Let me just tell her we're here.

LORENSON

Hello. I'm Beth Lorenson.

LORENSON

It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks...

LORENSON

And you are...?

JACKIE

I'm just William's friend.

LORENSON

I think we'll be fine from here.

Thanks, Stanley.

74.

LORENSON

My God you look exactly like him.

STARKS

I never knew my father. Did you?

LORENSON

Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most

memorable patient.

STARKS

Why?

LORENSON

At the end, he made me change my mind

about a lot of things.

STARKS

You thought my father was crazy?

LORENSON

No. I don't think he was crazy. He

needed help...but he wasn't crazy.

[Beat] Your father actually helped me

with a case of mine.

STARKS

What case?

LORENSON

I was working with a boy named

Eugene.

JACKIE

Who was Eugene?

LORENSON [Peaked]

He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you

familiar with the case?

75.

JACKIE

Just a little, when we were looking

up information about William's

father. How did he help?

LORENSON

It's complicated, but [looking at

Starks] in a way, your father let me

know how I'd get through to him.

JACKIE

How?

LORENSON

He just said...that I'd shock Eugene

and then things would change for him.

JACKIE

I don't understand.

LORENSON

I still don't either, even after all

these years.

STARKS

Do you know how my father died?

LORENSON [Unconvincingly]

I don't know how much I remember but

I seem to think it was from a... cut or

blow of some sort or another.

STARKS

How'd he get it?

LORENSON

[Beat] I don't know.

STARKS

But Dr. Morgan said you were around

when my father was...

LORENSON

I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a

lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know

more about your father's. [Sincerely]

I didn't know about everything that

went on here.

76.

STARKS

Well, do you think Dr. Becker would

have any idea?

LORENSON

How do you know about Dr. Becker?

STARKS

My dad wrote some things down before

he died.

LORENSON

That's right. He did.

LORENSON

So maybe Dr. Becker would know.

[Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the

statute of limitations has run out

for charging the hospital with any

liabilities.

STARKS

Why would we do that?

JACKIE

Because Becker resigned after the

charges brought against him by State

Patient Advocacy Groups.

LORENSON

I see you've done your homework.

[Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot

of changes since then. At the time,

we didn't have the...resources to

help our patients the way we needed

to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are

different.

STARKS

I wouldn't be so sure. Like you said

about back then, you might not know

everything going on around here.

77.

LORENSON

It's important for you to know who

your father was, isn't it?

STARKS

[Beat] Yeah, it is.

LORENSON [Eerily]

It's almost as if your life depended

on it. Isn't it?

STARKS

Exactly.

LORENSON

Well... [beat] let me know how your

search turns out.

STARKS

[Beat] We will.

STARKS

I don't believe a thing she just

said.

JACKIE

Me neither. Who was the boy she was

talking about, Eugene?

STARKS

I have no idea.

JACKIE

You think Lorenson kills you?

STARKS

Maybe. I don't know. Seems more

likely Becker does, but at the very

least she knows how I died.

JACKIE

Let's see if they have an address for

Becker. I also want to figure out

more about the kid you helped her

with.

STARKS

Why?

78.

JACKIE

Because that's the part I believe is

true. You probably did help her

somehow with the boy and Eugene's

name did come up over and over again

on the abstracts I pulled.

STARKS

[Beat] There's one more thing I want

to see.

STARKS

This was the room. They used to hang

the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie]

This is where it happened. This is

the room I'm actually in right now.

STARKS

I can show you. It's probably in

there.

79.

JACKIE

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...

STARKS

Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were

the only things I could move. [Beat]

Dead bodies don't bleed. And they

certainly can't claw so hard they

dent metal.

DAMON

You folks ain't supposed to be down

here.

JACKIE

We were just leaving.

DAMON

Do I know you from somewhere?

STARKS

You may have known my father, William

Starks.

DAMON

That's right! Goddamn, you're the

spitting image. I didn't know he had

a son.

STARKS

He didn't either.

DAMON [With a dirty laugh]

I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when

he had you. [Beat] You could be his

ghost.

80.

STARKS

Did you know my father?

DAMON

Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop,

right?

STARKS

You wouldn't happen to know how he

died, would you?

DAMON [Slightly apprehensive]

No, I don't. I just remember them

finding his body.

STARKS

You don't know any more, Damon?

DAMON [Shocked]

How'd you know my name?

STARKS

My father used to talk about you.

DAMON

Oh yeah, what'd he say?

STARKS

He said you were a sadistic fuck that

belonged in jail.

DAMON

Look here, I don't like you getting

in my face and saying this bullshit

to me...

STARKS

That's too bad.

DAMON

I thought you said you never knew

your father.

STARKS

I didn't. [Beat] Did you have

anything to do with his death?

81.

DAMON

I don't know what you're talking

about, man. I swear. This is some

weird shit you're telling me... and I

don't know how come you're doing it.

STARKS

He died because he bled to death from

a blow to his head. Someone had to

have given him it.

DAMON

I never touched your father! I swear!

STARKS

You know something, Damon? You're

like a mule. You're real stubborn.

But there's ways of fixin' that. All

you need is a good stick. [Beat]

Here's your stick. Live with it.

JACKIE

How long do we have?

STARKS

I don't know.

JACKIE

They told me Becker's in Shelbourne

now. I looked him up and he was

listed.

STARKS

How far away is that?

82.

83.

JACKIE

What about Captain Medley? He never

told them what happened to you over

there. His testimony...that coward

wanted them to think you were crazy.

STARKS

I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase

my sanity and you erase anything I'll

ever say.

JACKIE [Frustrated]

Well, doesn't what he did to you make

you mad?

STARKS

Of course it makes me mad. It makes

me more than mad. Just like

remembering the face of the man who

killed that officer and knowing

nothing more about him. But what's it

gonna do for me to find them now? I

can't fix everything in three days.

JACKIE

You've got to get yourself out of

that place. They're going to kill you

if you don't.

STARKS

I might not be able to.

JACKIE

It's not a prison, it's a hospital.

There's got to be some way out of

there and you've got to find it...

FADE TO:

84.

LORENSON

You'll die if you keep smoking those

in your condition.

STARKS

I'll die either way.

LORENSON

I can't try to help you unless you

let me. [Beat] I know about the

Jacket.

LORENSON

I'm sorry for what you were put

through, and I'm sorry I couldn't

stop it earlier. But I promise you

that I will from now on...

STARKS [Cutting him off]

I don't want you to.

85.

LORENSON

What do you mean?

STARKS

You have no idea what's going on.

LORENSON

No, I do. That's what I'm saying to

you.

STARKS

Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket

is my only chance in this place.

LORENSON

How can you say that in your physical

condition? Do you realize that it's

because you were put in it that

you're as...weak as you are now?

Becker's a man who's not well

himself.

STARKS

You don't understand.

LORENSON

Then help me understand. You know,

you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets

have begun to experience curious

symptoms. What you have might well be

a syndrome and, if so, it's not one

we know enough about to be treating

it this vigorously.

STARKS

This has nothing to do with that.

LORENSON [Exasperated]

Then what? What? [Beat] I can't guess

it. You have to help me.

STARKS

...What you do not know is the only

thing you know.

(MORE)

86.

STARKS (cont'd)

[Beat] And what you own is what you

do not own...

And where you are is where you are

not.

LORENSON

[Beat] Where is that from?

STARKS

I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?

LORENSON

Come on. Tell me what you do know.

STARKS

[Beat] I've seen a time that's not

this time. And I'm only able to see

it when I'm in the Jacket.

LORENSON

Well, what time is it?

STARKS

2004.

STARKS

You don't believe me.

LORENSON [Testing him]

Well, what year do you think it is

now?

STARKS [Exasperated]

I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.

Same as every sane person.

LORENSON

Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me

about the future. 2004. What does it

look like?

STARKS

It doesn't look all that different.

LORENSON

The future doesn't look different?

STARKS

No. Not for people like me. [Beat]

Not in the places I come from.

87.

LORENSON

What about the world?

STARKS

I didn't see that much of it -- same

as now. I only saw it as part of my

own life.

LORENSON

Do you think you're traveling in

time? Is that it?

STARKS

Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc.

LORENSON

[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie

maybe?

STARKS

Maybe.

LORENSON [Matter-of-factly]

Did he tell you he tried to kill his

wife?

LORENSON

MacKenzie locked himself up in his

house for two months and nearly

starved himself to death before he

was brought here. All because his

wife left him for another man.

STARKS [Adjusting it himself]

Maybe that just makes him weak, not

crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat]

Still doesn't make me think I am.

(MORE)

88.

STARKS [Adjusting it himself]

And, judging by the fact that you

just told me about another patient,

it doesn't even make you think I am,

so what don't you work on persuading

yourself first.

LORENSON

Why don't you help me?

STARKS

Because I don't have time.

LORENSON

Why not?

STARKS

I'm about to die unless I do

something to stop it.

LORENSON

And how do you know that?

STARKS

Because of the future. I know what's

going to happen.

LORENSON

William, that is just another facet

of my delusions.

STARKS

And what about your work with Eugene --

the kid? Is that another facet of my

delusions?

LORENSON

How do you know about Eugene?

STARKS

You told me about him. I saw you and

I think you thought I knew something

about him. So you told me.

LORENSON [Somewhat angrily]

How do you know about Eugene!?

89.

STARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief]

You told me. It's like two parts of

you talking through me. Look, judging

from your reaction, there's no other

way I could know about him.

LORENSON

There obviously is, so what don't you

just tell me how you found out about

him.

STARKS

Some part of you suspects -- even if

you don't know for sure -- that what

I'm saying is true.

LORENSON

I don't know how you know about

Eugene, but these ideas are part of

your delusions.

STARKS

NO! They're not my delusions! Look,

just leave my business with Becker to

me!

LORENSON

One thing's got nothing to do with

the other.

STARKS

One's got everything to do with the

other. So unless you want my blood on

your hands...leave what's between me

and Becker between me and Becker.

90.

MACKENZIE

Hey, I brought you some smokes.

STARKS

Lorenson said your wife left you for

another man and that's when you lost

it.

MACKENZIE

Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank

you"?

STARKS

Is it true?

MACKENZIE

She left me, I tried to kill her, I

tried to kill myself. She was mean, I

was weak, I was cruel so she left, I

didn't plan it, didn't see it...FINE!

MACKENZIE [Softly]

I didn't want to see it. I'm in here

because they say I have a nervous

condition. [Beat] Well, here's my

question, who wouldn't be nervous if

they really looked at their life?

[Beat] Whose life is that good?

MACKENZIE

Not this luckless little mammal's.

What difference is it to them? [Beat,

slows down] You believe what you want

to believe. One version is easier

than another so you make it your own.

91.

MACKENZIE

I'll tell you this though. However

nuts I am, I wasn't nuts enough not

to know how wrong it was to put a

human being in something like that.

STARKS

MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are

crazy?

MACKENZIE

[Shrugging] What if we are? There're

crazier things than thinking up

fictions for yourself. [Beat]

Everyone does it, don't they? Even

Becker. That roller coaster car pops

more pills than all of Ward 3.

STARKS

Becker does? Are you sure?

MACKENZIE

I've been here for 11 years. It's my

neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's

as drugged up as the rest of us...I

guess he has to be to put up with all

this.

STARKS

Thanks for the cigarettes. You

still got a lot of problems,

MacKenzie, but you're ok.

BECKER

At least it's some kind of bars we've

got you behind.

92.

BECKER

Hello, William. I understand you've

been asking for me almost every hour.

I would've been here sooner but you

gave our little state visitor quite a

bit to talk to me about.

STARKS

That's too bad.

BECKER

It is. But when it comes down to it,

you just have to patient with them.

They'd rather have their vacation,

too, so they just push dealing with

our "practices" off to the New Year.

STARKS

They make it hard for you to get away

with your business, huh?

BECKER

Temporarily.

STARKS

Makes it a little easier for me to

get away with mine.

BECKER

And what's that?

STARKS

My business?

BECKER

Yes.

STARKS

Getting away with things. Like

whatever I may or may not have gotten

away with Officer Harrison.

BECKER

You killed him?

93.

STARKS

And wound up in a better cage. [Beat]

But I still want to make a deal.

STARKS

See, the deluxe lab animal treatment

I've been receiving -- well, I don't

think it's worked. I woke up today

and realized... [eerily lowering his

voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So

really, what was the point? Torture?

I think that's still sort of illegal

in some states -- though we'll have to

check on Vermont. And, how's this for

the cherry on top: it seems my

physician is a pill-popping freak.

[Beat] Last time I checked, that

makes some pretty good copy for a lot

of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly]

"I don't remember everything they did

to me. I just remember the worst

parts." I think I should be sitting

down when I say it, don't you think?

BECKER

I think...I have to think about it.

BECKER

I think your story needs a little

fleshing out before it's ready to go.

BECKER

I'll say a prayer for you in Church

today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can

pick up where the medicine left off.

94.

STARKS

You sure you know where to find one?

BECKER

I've managed to every Sunday of my

life. [Beat] Some of us are God-

fearing men, Starks.

STARKS

And what does that mean?

BECKER

Means we believe in doing his work

and fear what the world would be like

if we didn't at least try to.

STARKS

Becker, how do you sleep at night?

BECKER

You in here. [Beat] Works like a

drug.

LORENSON

Nina, William Starks is to stay in

ICU all night. If anything is

supposed to change, I want to be

called about it.

NINA

Sure, Dr. Lorenson.

LORENSON

Hi. [Beat] Sorry I'm late.

95.

TALIA

It's ok. [To Eugene] Hi, Eugene.

LORENSON

Talia, I need to ask you something.

TALIA

What is it?

LORENSON

Have you told anyone about my

sessions with Eugene?

TALIA [With an accent]

Of course not. [Off Lorenson's still

doubtful look] I swear I haven't. I

wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you.

You know that.

LORENSON

Has anyone been asking about him?

TALIA

No. I would have told you.

DAMON

No funny business or we can make this

a lot fucking harder for you.

96.

STARKS

[Weakly] No funny business.

LORENSON

Eugene, this is a "TRAIN."

LORENSON

Come on back down here. Wherever you

are...try to come on back. You'll

like it, I promise.

97.

CUT TO:

JACKIE

You just scared me, that's all.

STARKS

Me, too.

JACKIE

Here, drink this. I'll get the heat

going.

98.

JACKIE [O.S.]

I think this is his house.

STARKS

You're sure?

JACKIE

Yeah. I called the number yesterday

to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired

M.D.

JACKIE

They're not here.

STARKS

They're not.

JACKIE

[Beat, lost] No.

JACKIE

Maybe they're out.

99.

JACKIE

How much time do we have?

STARKS [Distracted]

I don't know.

JACKIE

What? What are you thinking?

STARKS

There're no cars on this street.

JACKIE

Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can

that be?

STARKS

I don't know. Maybe that's because

this whole thing is a dream. How can

you have a street with no cars on it?

JACKIE

I don't know. But this isn't a dream.

I'm real, and so is where we are.

STARKS

Then why isn't there anyone around?

JACKIE

[Beat] I don't know.

JACKIE

What are you doing?

JACKIE

William! William!

100.

JACKIE

Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have

to come back.

STARKS

Of course he will. [Beat] What day of

the week is it?

JACKIE

It's Sunday.

STARKS [Nodding]

It's Sunday.

JACKIE

So?

STARKS

Look where these people live.

STARKS

They've got lives to be grateful for.

JACKIE

William, you're not making sense.

STARKS

[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet

that's where Becker is.

101.

STARKS

You still go to Church. How's that

work? Your God just doesn't notice?

That it? [Beat, serious] How you

doin', Dr. Becker?

BECKER'S GRANDSON

Grandpa?

BECKER [Still looking at Starks]

Sean, why don't you wait for me by

the car? I'll be there in a minute.

[Turning to the kid] Ok?

BECKER [To Starks]

Can I help you?

STARKS

I don't know, Dr. Becker. Can you?

102.

BECKER

Who are you?

STARKS

I think you know. Your eyes say you

do.

BECKER

[Beat] You're his son?

STARKS

No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat]

What? You look like you've seen a

ghost. You can come here and touch

me, old man. I'm the real thing.

BECKER

How...how are you here?

BECKER

You died, Starks. Years ago, in the

hospital.

STARKS

I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't

you?

BECKER

No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I

probably helped push you to kill

yourself, but I didn't do it.

STARKS

I didn't kill myself. I died from a

blow to the head. How'd it happen? I

have to know.

BECKER

I don't know how you died. The last

time I put you in the Jacket was just

after you told me you remembered

killing that police officer...

103.

STARKS

I didn't say I remembered killing

him. I just repeated some words to

get myself back in there.

BECKER

I know. [Beat] I knew that when you

came out.

STARKS

How?

BECKER

Because...because you came out and

said something you couldn't have

possibly have known. You came back

and repeated three names...

BECKER

Of people like you. People I was just

trying to help. They couldn't get

worse so I thought, with medication,

they might get...

STARKS

Medication? What kind of meds do you

chase with nights in a cadaver

drawer?

BECKER

It was part of the treatment I

intended...I didn't know what the

effects would be...

STARKS

So, what, you guinea pig sick people

to find out?

BECKER

The three of you weren't regular

patients. You were criminals that

ended up at Alpine Grove.

STARKS

No, we were patients.

BECKER

You and the others didn't seem that

way then.

104.

STARKS

Who were the others?

BECKER [Racked with remorse]

Nathan Piechowski, Jackson

MacGregor, and Ted Casey. [Beat] I

didn't ask for you -- for any of

you. You were all sent to me.

BECKER

What is it?

BECKER

How did you come to know their

names?

STARKS

You just told me. The last time I

was with you was when I was in the

Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr.

Becker.

BECKER

I don't understand...

STARKS

I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're

haunting yourself right now. [Beat]

I guess sometimes we indict

ourselves if no one else does. You

didn't make history like you wanted

to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out

different, didn't it?

BECKER

I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.

STARKS

No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and

then you put me in the Jacket.

105.

BECKER [Stoically]

I was sorry when I heard you died.

I was, but...how was I to know you

didn't shoot that police officer?

STARKS

The same way you just said I didn't

without my ever telling you. [Beat]

And that still doesn't excuse what

you did. Just because you had keys

to a cage didn't mean you had

animals inside. [Beat] You've

earned your guilt, Becker.

JACKIE

That's all you got from him? That

bastard helped take your life away

from you.

STARKS

No, he didn't.

JACKIE

What? How can you say that? He's

the one that put you in that

goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's

probably the one who killed you.

STARKS

No one's killing anyone.

STARKS

Touch me. I'm okay.

106.

STARKS

If everything hadn't happened the

way it has, then I wouldn't be here

right now, sitting in a car with

you, touching your face.

JACKIE

Why are you saying that? [Beat] We

don't have long, do we?

STARKS

Where are we going?

JACKIE

To the hospital.

JACKIE

Claire, I need help.

STARKS

What's happening to me? Why am I

getting so much weaker?

JACKIE

Because your body can only take so

much of what they're putting you

through.

CLAIRE

Jesus, what's happened to him?

107.

STARKS

Lorenson's the only one that could

let me out of there. I need something

to persuade her that I was there. Get

me something to take to her.

JACKIE

Ok. Ssh. Rest.

JACKIE [In a panic]

He's not...?

CLAIRE

No, no. [Beat] Not yet. But he

doesn't have long. Are you sure you

don't want a doctor to look at him?

JACKIE

No! It won't do any good. [Beat]

Please, Claire. They won't

understand.

FLASHBACK TO:

108.

TENNY

Hey, Mister, you need a ride?

STARKS

Where are you going?

TENNY

I'm going to Canada but I can let

you ride with me up to the border.

TENNY

Can you drive?

STARKS

Sure.

TENNY

Great, get in. We'll switch off in

a bit.

CUT TO:

109.

JACKIE

William, please, honey, wake up.

For me.

JACKIE

Can you hear me?

JACKIE

I found out about Eugene. The little

boy. He's the key. That's who you

have to tell her about when you get

back there. It's the only way to

prove this to her.

CUT TO:

RETURN TO:

STARKS

Jackie?

STARKS [Somewhat urgently]

Where do you live?

JACKIE

What?

STARKS

When we first met, when you were 7,

where was the house you lived in

with your mother? Do you remember

your address?

110.

JACKIE

112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a

whisper] You're not coming back,

are you?

STARKS

You gotta stop thinking like that.

JACKIE

Then, where are you going?

STARKS

Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm

gonna be sick.

JACKIE [In a whisper]

You come back to me...

LORENSON [Stunned]

Oh dear God.

111.

STARKS

I'm William Starks. I'm not his son.

And...and the kid you work with.

Your friend's son...Eugene...

LORENSON

I know. I know it all. Save your

strength. I already know everything

you're going to say. [Beat] You're in

the Jacket right now, aren't you?

STARKS

How...how do you know?

LORENSON

You told me this was how it

happened.

STARKS

I did?

LORENSON

Yeah.

STARKS

Who...who kills me?

LORENSON

You have nothing to fear, William.

STARKS [Whispering]

Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I

know what you did to your patients.

112.

STARKS

Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson

MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You

didn't cure them. You killed them.

FADE TO:

SALLY

Would you like anything, Dr.

Lorenson?

LORENSON

A cup of coffee would be great,

Sally. Thanks.

SALLY

Is he gonna be ok?

LORENSON

I hope so.

113.

SALLY

Me, too.

LORENSON

You're going to be ok, William. We

just need to get your fever down

and we'll be able to hopefully

stabilize you.

STARKS

Who are you kidding, Doc? You or

me?

STARKS

Can I get some paper and something

to write with.

LORENSON

What for?

STARKS [Solemnly]

I'm starting to think I'm really

gonna die soon. So I'd like to write

some things down.

LORENSON

I'm not gonna let that happen.

STARKS

You still don't believe me, do you?

LORENSON

I do believe you...

STARKS

No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...

STARKS

No one knows you're working with him

so how would I have found out? He's

your friend's son, right?

114.

LORENSON

William, I can't indulge these

delusions, even when you're in this

state.

STARKS

Listen to me. That's all I ask.

STARKS

He's having absence [pronounced

"absance"] seizures when he stares

off into space like he does. He has

them so often that that's why he

hasn't learned to speak properly.

LORENSON

Who told you this?

STARKS

You did, in the future. You figured

it out because a part of you already

knows this. That's how it works.

[Beat] I'm just telling you something

you already know, even if you haven't

realized it.

STARKS

I don't know when it'll happen but

soon I think, you'll shock the boy

and it'll wake him up.

LORENSON

What are you talking about?

STARKS

You'll figure it out and you'll do

good by him.

CUT TO:

115.

LORENSON

Hey.

TALIA

What is it?

LORENSON [Finding it hard to explain]

Nothing. [Beat] I don't know. I

thought of something I could try.

LORENSON

Come on Eugene, try to say it with

me. This is a "DOG".

EUGENE

D--d---d----.

LORENSON [Softly]

What's happening to you?

LORENSON

Are you having a seizure? Is that

really what's going on?

116.

EUGENE

Dog. [To Talia] Hi.

STARKS [O.S., distantly]

You're going to...shock the boy and

then things will change for him.

LORENSON

You ok, Eugene?

LORENSON [Stunned himself]

Yeah, you are ok.

TALIA

What's happening?

LORENSON [Putting the pieces together]

He got a little shock. [To himself]

And it's reset him. Not permanently

probably...but at least for a little

while. They use it on epileptic

patients sometimes...

TALIA

But he's not epileptic.

LORENSON

No, but he is having seizures.

117.

STARKS

It worked, didn't it?

STARKS

This is really happening, isn't it?

DR. LORENSON

[Beat] What do you need me to do?

STARKS

[Beat] Thank you.

STARKS

I need to get this letter to

someone.

DR. LORENSON

I can't take you out of here in

your condition...

STARKS

And I can't stay here in my

condition. I am going to die

tonight. It's already been decided.

DR. LORENSON

No, it hasn't.

STARKS

Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up

'till today is done. Everything

starting with tomorrow is up for

grabs.

STARKS

You know how to get there?

118.

LORENSON

Sure. It's an easy address. A

little far out there, but easy

enough.

STARKS

Good.

LORENSON

You want me to come with you?

STARKS

No, I'll be ok.

STARKS

Hi.

JACKIE [Surprised]

Hey. [Beat] I remember you.

STARKS

I remember you, too.

STARKS

Jackie, how have you been?

119.

JACKIE

I've been ok.

STARKS

Good. How's your mom?

JACKIE

Ok, I guess.

STARKS

Do you think I could see her?

JACKIE

Sure.

JEAN

Can I help you?

STARKS

Hey, Jean. Nice to see you.

JEAN

I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully

familiar, I just can't quite place

it...

JACKIE

Mom, this is the guy that drove us

home that afternoon we were stuck

on the highway. The guy you yelled

at for no good reason...

JEAN

Oh, yeah.

120.

JEAN

There something you need?

STARKS

You could say that.

JEAN

Jackie, go play in the snow.

JACKIE

Why?

JEAN

Just do it.

STARKS

I can't stay long. [Motioning to

Lorenson] That's my doctor and I

gotta get back to the hospital.

Everything I want to say is in this

letter. [Beat] You can check as

much of it as you can.

STARKS

I won't be around when you read

it...but I hope you believe it.

It'd be a real shame if you didn't.

STARKS

[Beat] I should be on my way.

STARKS

Bye, Jackie.

121.

STARKS

Happy New Year to both of you.

JEAN

Thanks. You, too.

JACKIE

Hey, wait!

STARKS

[Beat] You be good to yourself,

Jackie.

JACKIE

Ok.

122.

STARKS (V.O.)

I was 25 years old the first time I

died. It didn't end anything though.

[Beat] Sometimes I think we live

through things only to be able to

tell them, to bear witness, to say

this happened.

STARKS (V.O.)

And it wasn't to someone else. It

was to me. And I lived despite it.

Sometimes I think we live to beat

the odds. And sometimes I agree

that life can only begin with the

knowledge of death. That it can all

end, even when you least want it

to.

STARKS

I'm telling you my story because

it's the only way I can try to help

your daughter, and you, have a

better one of your own.

123.

STARKS (V.O.)

It's scary...and lucky...how much we

can forget. Scary because we think

the past gives us our bearing, and

lucky because in those moments I'm

talking about, you realize it

doesn't. And it never had to.

STARKS (V.O.)

I am not a crazy man, even though

they mistook me for one. I live in

the same world as the rest of you.

Only I saw more of it.

STARKS (V.O.)

And the seeing is the only way you

can hear what the truth around you

is saying: you can always start

believing in things you don't

already believing in. And, while

you're alive, it's never too late.

124.

DISTORTED VOICE

No! Wa...atch out!

125.

STARKS (V.O.)

I promise you, Jean. No matter how

bad the days and things around you

look, they look better awake than

they do asleep. I can offer you

some proof: when you die, there's

only one thing you want to have

happen...sometimes so badly it

comes true, I guess. [Beat] You

want to come back.

126.

FADE TO BLACK.

JACKIE

Hey there. [Beat] You ok?

STARKS

I think so.

JACKIE

You're bleeding pretty bad there.

JACKIE

It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just

a cut. We can get it fixed.

(MORE)

127.

JACKIE (cont'd)

But we need to get you to the

hospital now. How'd you get that?

STARKS

I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.

JACKIE [Laughing a little]

Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's

New Year's Day. You're not going to

get a cab. Especially not here. And

you're gonna freeze if you stand out

here in the snow much longer. I'm on

my way back to my shift at the

hospital...

STARKS

You work there?

JACKIE [Gesturing to her uniform]

Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let

me give you a ride...

STARKS

Thanks.

JACKIE

Sorry, one sec.

JACKIE

Hey! How are you? [Beat] Thanks. I

was just thinking about you, too.

JACKIE

Listen, I gotta go, mom, 'cause I'm

late... but, thanks. Happy New Year to

you, too. I'll call you later. [Beat]

Ok, bye.

128.

JACKIE

Sorry about that. It was my mom.

STARKS

Nothin' to worry about there.

JACKIE (O.S.)

How you doin'?

STARKS

I'm doing fine.

THE END
