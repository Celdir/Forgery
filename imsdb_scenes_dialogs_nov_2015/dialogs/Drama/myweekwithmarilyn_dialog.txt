MY WEEK WITH MARILYN

Written by

Adrian Hodges

Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:

"This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,

which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.

Then, FADE UP ON:

Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH

arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited

crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop

to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:

COMMENTATOR

"Returning to England are

Britain's acting royalty Sir

Laurence Olivier and Lady

Olivier, better known as stunning

Gone With The Wind star Vivien

Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a

new string to his bow with the

announcement that he is to direct

and star in a screen version of

Terence Rattigan's stage play The

Sleeping Prince with none other

than Hollywood siren Marilyn

Monroe. When the world's greatest

actor romances the most famous

woman alive, we can be sure that

sparks will fly. Now, now Lady

Olivier, don't worry - any

romance is strictly for the

camera!"

As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -

CUT TO:

It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark

family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting

sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,

complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling

of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something

profoundly English.

We are a very long way from Hollywood.

CUT TO:

COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he

is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a

beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak

doors.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2.

COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library.

As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front

of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,

Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a

woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the

painting.

KENNETH

... and this is one of Carracci's

earlier works and one is able to

see the emergence of his now famous

Baroque style, which is clearly

rooted in the tradition of high

renaissance and antiquity...

COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the

scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The

whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams

affectionately.

KENNETH

Colin! Come in. Have you met James

and Anna? Two very brilliant

pupils.

He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a

little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no

time to waste.

COLIN

I'm leaving for London now, Pa.

KENNETH

Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear

boy...

He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to

walk him back to the door.

KENNETH

I can always get you a research

position at the V&A when you've

grown up a bit and got this film

idea out of your system...

COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into

the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

JANE

Kenneth, you might have told Cook

we were another two for dinner.

What is everyone supposed to eat?

Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,

there you are...

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A.

She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,

eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a

dozen things at once.

COLIN

I'm off now, Mama.

JANE

Off?

COLIN

My job interview, remember..?

But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles

hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as

COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

CUT TO:

JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.

JANE

Can't you stay for dinner? There's

nothing to eat but I'm sure the

conversation will be charming.

COLIN

I don't want to be late in the

morning.

As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an

elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning

evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.

JANE

I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be

a famous film director in no time.

I know your father's put in a word.

COLIN

I wish he hadn't done that. I can

manage on my own.

She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks

around the garden with a frown.

JANE

I have to watch Jenkins like a

hawk. One more of his murderous

prunings and we'll lose the tea

roses for ever.

And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't

help smiling at the madness of it all.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2B.

The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.

COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in

the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but

racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her

attention fully to him for the first time.

JANE

Now go and have a lovely time,

darling. We're always here when

you're ready to talk your future.

COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out

JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house

with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.

JANE

Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook

and ask her how many pork chops we

need for tonight. Then bring the

car round. I must get to the

village before the shop shuts...

She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an

afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.

COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.

We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly

his need to get away.

He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of

the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,

the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for

the road ahead.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3.

CUT TO CREDITS OVER A MONTAGE OF SCENES OF LONDON

IN THE 1950s FROM COLIN'S POINT OF VIEW. AS HE

MAKES HIS WAY INTO THE CITY WE SEE THE STATUE OF

EROS AGAINST THE LIGHTS OF PICCADILLY CIRCUS,

CROWDS MILLING AROUND TRAFALGAR SQUARE, YOUNG

PEOPLE SPILLING OUT OF CLUBS AND COFFEE BARS IN

SOHO, UNTIL, WE FADE TO:

A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.

It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The

streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and

raincoats stream from the tube stations.

COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in

Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home

here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes

by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in

measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.

COLIN waves back.

CUT TO:

Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops

outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque

outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.

Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure

everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and

rings the bell.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 4.

The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and

plush sofas. VANESSA, the beautiful secretary, sits behind

her imposing desk, gazing doubtfully at COLIN.

VANESSA

You're not in Mr. Perceval's

diary.

COLIN

Larry told me to come.

She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone. We

hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice

carrying irritably.

PERCEVAL

(OFF)

Yes?

VANESSA

I have a Mr. Colin Clark here. He

says Sir Laurence sent him.

She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's

familiarity.

PERCEVAL

(OFF)

Oh, God... not another one of

Vivien's pretty boys.

VANESSA looks at COLIN with amusement. His smile falters as

he feels himself coming down to earth with a bump.

CUT TO:

HUGH PERCEVAL (40s) is Laurence Olivier's production

executive. He is tall and gloomy, with black-rimmed

spectacles and thinning dark hair. He looks at COLIN grimly

as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco.

PERCEVAL

Well, what do you want?

COLIN

A job on your Marilyn Monroe

film.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 5.

PERCEVAL

Oh really, what as?

COLIN

I want to work on the production

side.

He smiles with as much charm as he can muster. PERCEVAL

isn't impressed.

PERCEVAL

There are no jobs yet. We don't

start shooting for eight weeks.

COLIN

May I wait?

PERCEVAL

What?

COLIN

Until there's a job.

PERCEVAL

For eight weeks?

COLIN

Something might come up.

PERCEVAL is distracted as the telephone rings.

PERCEVAL

Terry? Larry wondered how the

script was coming...

CUT TO:

COLIN troops back to the sofa. VANESSA gives him a cool

glance. COLIN looks at the clock. It has just gone 10.30.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 6.

We see the day pass as COLIN sits on the sofa - the clock

ticking slowly on the wall, VANESSA busy at her desk, COLIN

looking up hopefully from time to time, only to be

disappointed.

CUT TO:

It is now nearly 6 o'clock. COLIN sits exactly as he was.

PERCEVAL shares a look with VANESSA as he comes out of his

office. He gazes drily at Colin.

PERCEVAL

There are no jobs.

COLIN

I'll come back tomorrow morning.

Just in case.

PERCEVAL

It's a free country.

He sounds as though he rather regrets it.

COLIN arrives early, ready for another day.

COLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning.

PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his

office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her

eye optimistically but she ignores him.

The clock ticks around with agonising slowness to 11.00.

VANESSA finally gives Colin a pitying look.

VANESSA

Are you going to sit there all

day?

COLIN

If I have to.

VANESSA

You're very determined.

COLIN

I'd do anything to be in the film

business.

VANESSA

Anything?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 7.

She smiles cheekily. He grins back, sensing an opportunity.

VANESSA

You can start by making me a cup of

tea. White, two sugars.

CUT TO:

14 OMITTED 14

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8.

Close on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to

12.30. VANESSA puts on her gloves and collects her bag.

She gives COLIN a sly look.

VANESSA

You can answer the telephone while

I'm at lunch, if you like.

She winks. COLIN grins. The phone rings. He picks it up.

COLIN

Laurence Olivier Productions...

CALLER

(ON PHONE)

Is Sir Laurence there?

COLIN

He's at Notley until the end of

the week. Can I take a message?

CALLER

(ON PHONE)

I'll call back.

No sooner has COLIN hung up than PERCEVAL appears. He

stares at COLIN.

COLIN

Vanessa asked me to...

PERCEVAL

Oh, did she? Why didn't you put

that call through?

COLIN

There didn't seem any need to

bother you. But if you want me to

transfer every single one...

PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.

PERCEVAL

Use your judgement.

He hesitates and looks back.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

I need a number for Noel Coward.

It won't be in the book, so

you'll have to track him down.

COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8A.

The phone rings in the beautiful central hall. JANE CLARK

picks up the phone.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9.

COLIN

(ON PHONE)

Hello, Mama.

JANE

Colin, darling! How are you

getting on?

CUT BACK TO:

COLIN glances towards Perceval's office and talks quickly.

COLIN

(ON PHONE)

This is urgent. I need Noel

Coward's London number. My life

depends on it.

JANE

How exciting. Let me see... it's

Sloane 2965. Ask him if he's

coming to Saltwood for the bank

holiday.

COLIN

I will. Mama, you're an angel.

CUT TO:

PERCEVAL looks up as COLIN puts the number on his desk.

PERCEVAL

That was quick.

COLIN

I had a bit of luck.

PERCEVAL looks at him shrewdly.

PERCEVAL

Am I supposed to be impressed?

Did Mummy and Daddy help? Don't

think they can do the job for you.

The only way you'll get on in this

business is through bloody hard

work.

COLIN

Yes, sir.

COLIN leaves.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9A.

A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.

Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The

seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his

campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything

changes.

He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR

LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on

his arm.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.

OLIVIER

Do you know, Hughie, it is simply

impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on

the telephone? The darling girl

spends the entire day asleep. But

great beauty has its way...

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Hello, boy... remind me?

VIVIEN

You remember Colin, darling. You

met him at the Clarks' party.

OLIVIER

(NO IDEA)

Of course. What are you doing

here?

COLIN

You said there might be a job on

your film.

OLIVIER

Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 11.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

There won't be any film unless

Miss Monroe gets her splendid

posterior out of bed.

PERCEVAL

The House Committee are

threatening to withhold Miller's

passport. They say he's a

communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.

OLIVIER

I'll have a word with the

American ambassador. I'm taking

him to see Vivien in South Sea

Bubble on Thursday... now, tell

me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites

in?

VIVIEN

They named them after Larry. The

first actor since Du Maurier to

have his own brand and they pay

him an absolute fortune. (Pause)

I'm afraid they're rather

ghastly.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?

VANESSA

I suppose he's all right.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12.

VIVIEN

(TO COLIN)

Let's elope together and have the

most glorious affair. (Arch) Oh,

but then, who'd look after my

poor Larry?

Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.

VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

Now, darling, you must do

something for Colin. You

absolutely promised.

OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back

at PERCEVAL as he comes in.

OLIVIER

Let's try to find him something

to do, Hughie.

COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.

VIVIEN

You will take care of my precious

Larrykins, won't you?

She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss.

COLIN's smile falters as he sees PERCEVAL looking at him

grimly.

COLIN stands eagerly at PERCEVAL's desk. PERCEVAL looks at

him, more than usually brusque.

PERCEVAL

Arthur Jacobs, Miss Monroe's

publicist is flying in tomorrow.

He wants to see the house she'll

be staying in. Find something

suitable.

20

COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a

tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed

and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-

up screen in the corner of the room.

Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the

film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice

of Colin.

He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,

hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in

character as Elsie Marina.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A.

The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting

silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in

costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she

wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking

wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.

It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,

fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still

holding the tray -

PERCEVAL

(TO CARDIFF)

Larry says he particularly likes

this dress. She looks radiant.

CARDIFF

Exactly - we need to tone her down

a bit.

PERCEVAL

How the hell do you tone down

Marilyn Monroe?!

COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to

look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at

him stonily.

PERCEVAL

Marilyn Monroe's publicist is

flying in tomorrow. He wants to see

the house she'll be staying in.

Find something suitable.

COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the

door when PERCEVAL barks at him again.

PERCEVAL

And leave the bloody tea.

COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it

down and hurries out.

COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol

sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring

around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully

as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that

Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then

grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his

foot.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13.

COLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming

English cottage.

CUT TO:

COTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of

Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front

door, looking down his nose at COLIN.

COTES-PREEDY

Out of the question. I can't have

a lot of awful film people

tramping through the house in

dirty boots.

COLIN

We'd pay a hundred pounds per

week for 18 weeks.

COTES-PREEDY

My wife would never agree.

COLIN

That's a pity. I'll have to tell

Miss Monroe to look elsewhere,

then.

COTES-PREEDY double takes.

COTES-PREEDY

Marilyn Monroe?

COLIN

(NODS)

She's making a film with Sir

Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping

Prince. From the play by Terence

Rattigan.

COTES-PREEDY

I saw it in the West End a couple

of years ago. Vivien Leigh was

marvellous.

COLIN

It's Marilyn Monroe in the film.

COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14.

COTES-PREEDY

(After a second)

I suppose I'd have to be

introduced..?

CUT TO:

24 DELETED 24

ARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped,

pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently

outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his

arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly.

COLIN

Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope

you had a pleasant flight.

JACOBS

Where's the fucking car?

CUT TO:

JACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports

car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he

grunts in disgust.

JACOBS

Jeez, do you Brits actually read

this stuff?

He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot

out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud

behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows

and on neat front lawns.

COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood.

CUT TO:

JACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently

unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at

his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the

property.

JACOBS

What is this place? A brothel?

COTES-PREEDY's face falls.

COTES-PREEDY

It's one of the best houses in

the area.

JACOBS

Jesus. And I thought you Brits

had taste.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 15.

He glances at COLIN.

JACOBS (CONT'D)

Is this the best you can do?

COLIN

It's very near Pinewood.

JACOBS

All right. We'll take it. (Pause)

But ditch the wallpaper. It's

given me a migraine.

CUT TO:

JACOBS slaps down a copy of the Evening Standard on the

desk. The front page carries a picture of Tibbs Farm with

the caption: "Exclusive - Marilyn's Luxury Home In

England". He jabs a finger at it angrily.

OLIVIER

News travels fast.

JACOBS

That house was perfect for

Marilyn.

PERCEVAL

We can't use it now.

COLIN

Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy

wouldn't be able to keep this

quiet.

They stare to him in surprise. He looks at them boldly.

COLIN

When you asked me to find a house

for Miss Monroe I took the

precaution of finding two. The

other one, Parkside, is much

better and the owner is very

discreet.

PERCEVAL

But now we have two expensive

houses when we only wanted one.

COLIN

I thought someone else on the

production might want it.

PERCEVAL

Oh, did you?

There is a dangerous moment when things could go either

way. COLIN has gambled everything in a bid to impress them.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 16.

He waits in tense silence, staring at their puzzled

expressions. But then JACOBS shrugs.

JACOBS

I guess Milton could use it. It's

near the studio, near Marilyn.

OLIVIER looks at COLIN, then bursts out laughing.

OLIVIER

What are we paying you, boy?

He glances at COLIN with amusement.

COLIN

Nothing...

OLIVIER

(LAUGHING)

See to it, Hughie!

PERCEVAL sighs grimly.

CUT TO:

Pinewood studios is the glamorous heart of the British film

industry. COLIN drives up to the gate and smiles at the

SECURITY MAN.

COLIN

Colin Clark. Sir Laurence Olivier

Productions.

CUT TO:

ACTORS in full costume walk past, TECHNICIANS move lights

and cameras, EXTRAS are herded to their scenes by harried

ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. COLIN takes it all in with wondering

eyes. To him the studio is a magical place.

CUT TO:

The dressing rooms are little more than empty shells.

JACOBS looks around. OLIVIER and PERCEVAL are with him,

while COLIN waits attentively.

PERCEVAL

The set decorators will have it

all sorted out in no time.

JACOBS

Marilyn hates red. And blue.

(Pause) And green.

PERCEVAL

What about white?

JACOBS

I'd have to clear it with her.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 17.

OLIVIER

Beige, then. Beige is rarely

controversial.

JACOBS considers this, unaware that Olivier is teasing him.

JACOBS

I guess that's okay. She's never

said nothing about beige. Paula

will need the room next door.

COLIN

Paula?

JACOBS

Strasberg. Marilyn's acting

coach.

OLIVIER looks at him darkly. JACOBS shrugs.

JACOBS (CONT'D)

She's nuts about the Method.

OLIVIER

Stanislavski and the Method are

perfectly fine in the rehearsal

room but they don't belong on a

film set. Time is too tight. I'm

sure Marilyn understands.

He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly.

JACOBS

Who the hell is this Commie Stan

Slavski?

CUT TO:

COLIN stands in the Production Office. DAVID ORTON (30s)

the First Assistant Director, a thin, fair-haired man

regards him with obvious irritation.

ORTON

I don't know why Hugh Perceval

sent you here. There's nothing I

can do for you.

COLIN

Why not?

ORTON

Are you in the union?

COLIN

No...

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18.

ORTON

Then you can't have a job on the

film.

COLIN

How do I get in the union?

ORTON

By getting a job on the film.

COLIN

But you just said I couldn't have

a job on the film unless I was in

the union.

ORTON

Exactly. It's called a closed

shop.

COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little.

ORTON (CONT'D)

I suppose I might be able to sort

something out. The Union owes me

a few favours. We haven't got a

third yet.

COLIN

A third?

ORTON

Third Assistant Director. (Pause)

You do know what the job is?

COLIN

Assisting the director?

ORTON

Christ, no! That's the last thing

you do. Lesson One. The third's

job is to do whatever the fuck I

tell him.

ORTON walks to the door, then looks back.

ORTON (CONT'D)

(SHOUTS)

What are you waiting for?

COLIN scrambles to follow him out.

CUT TO:

As ORTON and COLIN pass the wardrobe department COLIN

notices a pretty WARDROBE GIRL (LUCY) putting costumes on

the racks. She has dark hair and laughing eyes and is a

year or so younger than him. ORTON follows his gaze.

ORTON

Colin!

ORTON (CONT'D)

Lesson Two. You don't shit on

your own doorstep. Got it?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 19.

COLIN

Got it.

But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes.

ORTON and COLIN hurry through Pinewood.

ORTON

Where are you staying?

COLIN

My father's place in the Albany.

ORTON

You can forget that. Lesson Three.

The Third always stays nearby, not

in some bloody palace in London.

(Pause) Book a room at the Dog And

Duck down the road. It's a bit

rough but you'll get used to it.

He grins, enjoying himself.

ORTON (CONT'D)

Now make yourself useful. Marilyn

needs a bodyguard. Sort something

out.

CUT TO:

PERCEVAL sits with COLIN and ROGER SMITH. SMITH is a

dignified figure in his mid-fifties. His erect bearing

speaks of a lifetime in the police.

PERCEVAL

I'm sure you understand the

sensitive nature of the job,

Superintendant?

ROGER

No need for the title. I'm

retired from the force. (Pause)

Something about looking after a

cinema actress?

PERCEVAL

Not just any actress. Marilyn

Monroe.

He gets no reaction from the stolid ex-policeman.

ROGER

I've never had much time for the

pictures.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 20.

PERCEVAL

Excellent. (Pause) For the next

four months you never leave her

side, day or night. There will be

crowds.

ROGER

That doesn't bother me.

PERCEVAL pauses awkwardly.

PERCEVAL

Her behaviour is reputedly a

little... erratic.

ROGER

She drinks?

PERCEVAL

Amongst other things.

ROGER

Pills?

PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause.

PERCEVAL

It would be useful if you could

keep us informed of her...

domestic situation.

ROGER

You want me to spy on her?

Perceval and Roger understand each other perfectly.

PERCEVAL

Just the odd early warning if you

know she's going to be late on

set. That kind of thing.

Smith takes this in his stride; he seems wholly immune to

the glamour of the movies.

CUT TO:

JACOBS chases after OLIVIER trying to get his attention.

OLIVIER is busy studying preliminary sketches of costumes

and set.

JACOBS

You need to speak to the Coca-Cola

people, Larry. They're crazy to be

involved with Marilyn.

PERCEVAL and COLIN meet them coming the other way.

PERCEVAL

Good news. The House Committee

have decided Miller isn't a

communist after all.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 21.

JACOBS

Of course he is. All those pain

in the ass New York intellectuals

are reds.

OLIVIER rolls his eyes behind JACOBS back. COLIN grins.

PERCEVAL

It means Marilyn will be flying

in next week on schedule.

JACOBS

She'll have to be met.

OLIVIER

Naturally, Vivien and I will be

there to greet her. But let's

keep it low key, shall we?

JACOBS

Don't worry. I've got it all under

control.

CUT TO:

Bedlam! The customs areas is besieged by shouting, pushing

JOURNALISTS as the POLICE fight to keep control. In the

middle of the chaos COLIN stands with ROGER SMITH watching

OLIVIER and VIVIEN addressing the gathered press.

OLIVIER

It is a deep happiness to me to

be translating Terence Rattigan's

magnificent play to the screen...

A voice suddenly rings out from the back of the previously

attentive crowd.

REPORTER

The plane's landed!

As one, the entire crowd turns away from Olivier and rushes

towards the plane. Suddenly abandoned, OLIVIER and VIVIEN

look momentarily startled before VIVIEN glances at him with

a half-smile.

VIVIEN

It seems we're not top of the

bill anymore, darling.

CUT TO:

MARILYN MONROE walks down the steps of a TWA jet on a rainy

London day. She clutches a bouquet of flowers and wears

DARK GLASSES;

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 22.

MARILYN and MILLER walks across the tarmac towards the

terminal and the crowd of PRESS waiting for them.

REPORTER

There she is! Marilyn!

The REPORTERS surge forward. COLIN follows their collective

gaze. She looks exactly as she should. The radiant smile, the

platinum blonde hair, the sexy wiggle. The most famous film

star in the world, so much herself it is almost unreal.

Walking through the crowd MARILYN smiles easily, whereas

MILLER looks stern and a little dazed by the sudden flurry of

attention. Flashbulbs pop as the POLICE struggle to contain

the crowd. MARILYN puts her arm around MILLER, who grins

blankly. The flashbulbs burst in front of them, a solid wall

of dazzling light.

REPORTER (CONT'D)

Marilyn! Over here, Marilyn!

REPORTER 2

Marilyn, this way..!

ARTHUR JACOBS observes the chaotic scenes with obvious

relish, grinning towards ROGER and COLIN.

JACOBS

Beautiful. You're looking at

tomorrow's front page, boys.

ROGER looks at COLIN.

ROGER

We have to get them to the hall.

COLIN barges his way through the scrum behind ROGER and

briefly finds himself directly in front of MARILYN. For a

moment he is transfixed by her beauty and charisma but she

doesn't even see him as she follows the commanding ROGER

obediently, tugging Miller along behind her, leaving Colin in

her wake.

CUT TO:

39 DELETED 39

MARILYN sits with MILLER at her side, flanked by OLIVIER

and VIVIEN. MARILYN wears a large pair of sunglasses.

PHOTOGRAPHERS jam their flashbulbs into her face. ROGER

hovers protectively with COLIN.

OLIVIER smiles as he addresses the crowd.

OLIVIER

It's my genuine pleasure to

introduce a woman who needs no

introduction.

(MORE)

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 23.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

A great actress on her first trip

to London whom I have no doubt...

REPORTER

How do you like being married,

Marilyn?

MARILYN

I like it a lot.

REPORTER

Is this third time lucky?

MARILYN

You bet it is. Arthur's the

greatest man I ever met.

REPORTER

Marilyn, are you planning to see

the sights?

MARILYN

I'd love to see the little fellow

with the bow and arrow in

Piccadilly Circus.

REPORTER 2

Is it true you want to be a

classical actor now?

MARILYN

I want to be the best actress I

can be.

REPORTER 2

There's a rumour you're going to

be in The Brothers Karamazov on

Broadway.

MARILYN

I'm considering it.

REPORTER 3

(SHOUTS)

Which of them will you be

playing?

MARILYN

I'll be playing Grushenka.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 24.

REPORTER 3

Can you spell that?

MARILYN

Sure. Can you?

REPORTER

So would you say you're an

intellectual now?

MARILYN

My husband is.

REPORTER 2

What's your definition of an

intellectual, Marilyn?

MARILYN

I guess you could look it up in a

dictionary.

REPORTER

Vivien, you created the part of

Elsie Marina on stage. Do you

have any advice for Marilyn?

VIVIEN

I am sure if Miss Monroe needs

any advice she'll get it from her

director. I hear he's terribly

good.

OLIVIER

In The Sleeping Prince we have

discovered the perfect vehicle

for Miss Monroe's luminous and

justly celebrated talent...

JACOBS

Marilyn, is it true you wear

nothing in bed except Chanel No

5?

MARILYN

As I'm in England let's say I

sleep in nothing but Yardley's

Lavender.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25.

The press laugh in delight. On the edge of the crowd COLIN

watches her, amused and impressed.

CUT TO:

A convoy of cars pass through the throng of JOURNALISTS

waiting at the gate. Marilyn's "secret" hideaway is no

longer much of a secret. The classical old house is elegant

and luxurious.

Outside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN

have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER.

ROGER watches unobtrusively.

VIVIEN

Are all your press conferences

like that, darling?

MARILYN

Well, that was quieter than some.

Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the

proceedings with an eagle eye.

JACOBS

Okay, let's get a snap of the

newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's

not a firing squad.

As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark-

haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN.

MILTON

This is some place you found.

He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.

OLIVIER

You have my new assistant Colin

to thank for that. (Pause, he

shepherds COLIN over) This is

Milton Greene. You must be very

nice to him. He owns half of

Marilyn Monroe Productions.

MILTON

Forty nine per cent, Larry.

GREENE (34) offers them a tired smile.

OLIVIER produces one of his branded packets and offers a

cigarette to Milton.

OLIVIER

Have a cigarette.

MILTON

I don't smoke.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 26.

OLIVIER

Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals.

Let's talk.

MILTON

Sure. And the studio wants a new

title.

OLIVIER escorts Milton away.

MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own.

ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his

ear. JACOBS nods and moves in to end the session.

JACOBS

The boys at the gate are getting

restless.

MILLER

Let's give them two minutes and

then we're done.

ROGER waves to the POLICEMEN, who open the gates. The PRESS

come pouring in like a mob of revolutionaries storming the

Bastille.

CUT TO:

COLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the

flashbulbs pop all around her. A moment later he is

surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow.

VIVIEN

Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose

you're quite smitten.

COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested.

COLIN

She's all right. A bit common.

VIVIEN

(LAUGHS)

Larry fell desperately in love

with her in New York. He's

determined to seduce her.

COLIN

But she's only been married three

weeks.

VIVIEN

Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man

of the world.

She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27.

VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Of course, Larry would never leave

me. (Pause) But, if anything were

to happen, you would let me know,

wouldn't you?

COLIN

I'm sure he loves you very much.

There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.

VIVIEN

Oh, don't be such a boy!

COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

At least you still adore me,

don't you?

COLIN

Of course. Everyone does.

There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.

VIVIEN

I'm 43, darling. No one will love

me for much longer. Not even you.

He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his

lips, her smile quickly restored.

CUT TO:

The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane

near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid

of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it

grimly, his bag in his hand.

CUT TO:

A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.

One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow

with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display

case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the

landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.

COLIN

Colin Clark. I booked a room.

BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it

around for COLIN to sign.

BARRY

What brings you up this way?

COLIN

I'm here working on a film.

BARRY

What film's that?

COLIN

It's called `The Sleeping Prince'.

ANDY

Sounds lousy.

BARRY

Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are

you, Andy?

ANDY

Can't be bothered.

COLIN

Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be

working with her.

BARRY

Oh, will you now?

ANDY

The Queen and Prince Philip popped

in for a pint earlier. Pity, you

just missed them.

BARRY

The room's three quid a week, first

week in advance. You're in number

two.

BARRY (CONT'D)

You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27B.

COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room

above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the

furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.

Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag

on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He

looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot

under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 28.

The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still

known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the

half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in

their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first

amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.

DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very

much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.

RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.

WATTIS

What a wonderful adventure, Dame

Sybil.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Such a lark! I long to see her.

COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and

shoots him a questioning glance.

CUT TO:

COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside

Marilyn's dressing room. He knocks on it politely.

COLIN

Miss Monroe?

The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman

in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Sir Laurence sends his

compliments. He's ready for the

READTHROUGH

He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the

mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears

little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.

PAULA

But Marilyn is not ready. She's

preparing.

MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with

unexpected simplicity.

MARILYN

Excuse the horrible face.

She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 29.

COLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA to the rehearsal room. He

sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost

expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he

notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away.

CUT TO:

The cast are all seated around the large table as COLIN

leads MARILYN and PAULA onto the stage. Marilyn keeps her

dark glasses on throughout. OLIVIER rises to greet her.

OLIVIER

Marilyn, here you are, everyone

is so excited to meet you...

He gestures to the company.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Let us begin. Do sit down,

please...

SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the

table and indicates the empty one at her side.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

How lovely you are. Here, I kept a

place for you.

PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an

empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She

looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to

the empty one.

PAULA

I have to be next to Marilyn!

The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way

around the table to the seat next to SYBIL THORNDIKE.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

(TO MARILYN)

Don't worry, dear, we won't bite.

PAULA looks at her in truculent apology.

PAULA

She likes me by her side.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

What a good idea! I wish we could

all bring a friend. One does get so

terribly nervous. It's just like

the first day at school, isn't it?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30.

She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from

behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as

he makes his opening speech of welcome.

OLIVIER

Welcome dear Marilyn, to our

little fraternity. (Pause, looks

around) We may seem a little

strange and quaint to you at

first, but I hope that in time

you may come to find your method

in our madness.

Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he

gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely

sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN

also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned

but clumsy joke.

Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a

sentimental flourish.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

So. My very noble and approv'd

good masters, let us now embark

on our great voyage of discovery

together. (Pause) With boldness

and (we pray) good fortune, may

we strive to create a work of art

that, led by your good graces,

will be cherished as long as

motion pictures may be

remembered.

He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes

discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.

There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of

eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the

reading.

CUT TO:

Page 10. PAULA turns the pages of MARILYN's script for her,

as though helping a child to read. OLIVIER is in full flow,

employing a heavy Mittel European accent.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31.

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"Were you surprised to get my

invitation?"

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"I'll say I was surprised. I was

so surprised I couldn't hardly

think you meant me."

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"oh but of course I meant you. I

had your name most carefully

marked down on my programme. In

matters of this kind I assure you

I am most methodical. Who did you

think I meant if not you?"

MARILYN

Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen

to your accent all day.

OLIVIER

You are amongst friends, my

darling angel. Just plain Larry

will suffice. (Pause) When you're

ready..?

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well, Maisie Springfield...

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"Oh, no, no, no not Maisie

Springfield, she's quite what I

would call old hat...

PAULA

Remember why you're in the

embassy, Marilyn. What does the

Grand Duke want from Elsie? She

thought there were going to be a

lot of people here and it's just

her.

OLIVIER

It's your line, Marilyn.

MARILYN

Oh, let's see... "Oh, and am I

what you'd call new hat?"

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 32.

OLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short

by PAULA's passionate whispering.

PAULA

Locate the experience, Marilyn.

Look for the memory that helps

you. Remember when you went to

that party at Chaplin's house and

you were the only guest? How did

that make you feel?

This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA.

OLIVIER

It is only a readthrough, Paula.

PAULA

Marilyn has to begin finding the

character.

OLIVIER

The character is on the page.

PAULA

The words, maybe. Not the

character.

RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK.

WATTIS

She's half cut!

DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns with regal disapproval and

smiles warmly at MARILYN.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Aren't we going to have fun?

The readthrough over, OLIVIER rails quietly at MILTON while

COLIN clears up the tea cups and plates used by the actors.

OLIVIER

We can't have two fucking

directors!

MILTON

Marilyn wants Paula.

OLIVIER

Why? She's got me!

MILTON

Paula is costing us two and half

thousand bucks a week. We might

as well use her. (Pause) Listen

Larry, accept Marilyn on her own

terms and you'll be okay.

(MORE)

MILTON (CONT'D)

Try to change her and she'll

drive you crazy. Trust me.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 33.

OLIVIER stalks away. COLIN takes a chance and follows him.

OLIVIER

Dear Christ, what have I got

myself into?

CUT TO:

COLIN follows LUCY the WARDROBE GIRL down a rack of

clothes. He is charming, glib and persistent.

COLIN

Come out with me tonight.

LUCY

I'm working.

COLIN

Tomorrow night, then.

LUCY

I'm washing my hair.

COLIN

Your hair's lovely.

She stops to look at him, attracted but cautious.

LUCY

Look, I have two rules. One,

never touch the talent...

COLIN

Everyone has a lot of rules

around here.

LUCY

... and two, never go out with

thirds.

COLIN

Why not?

LUCY

Because they're all randy little

buggers who just want some fun

during shooting.

COLIN

I'm not like that.

She looks at him sceptically.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Really.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 34.

LUCY

(SIGHS)

I'm free on Saturday.

ORTON

(OFF)

Colin!

COLIN ducks into a rack of clothes, making a face at Lucy.

She can't help smiling back.

CUT TO:

First light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it

is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate

wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands

to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down

and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

How kind of you to meet us. Dear

me, you do look cold.

COLIN

They're ready for you in make-up

Dame Sybil.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

How exciting! Don't you love the

first day of a new production?

COLIN

I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've

never had one before.

DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Oh, to be young again!

She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate.

Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley

appears.

OLIVIER

Marilyn here yet?

COLIN

Not yet.

CUT TO:

COLIN looks anxiously down the empty road. DAVID ORTON

strides towards him angrily.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 35.

ORTON

What the fuck's going on? I

thought you had a contact in her

house.

COLIN

I do...

ORTON

Well bloody use him, then.

CUT TO:

ROGER greets COLIN on the doorstep with a grin.

ROGER

She hasn't come down yet. Neither

has Miller. They're playing

trains.

COLIN stares at him blankly.

CUT TO:

OFFICE. DAY.

COLIN, ROGER and MILTON sit in silence, studiously avoiding

each other's eyes. Somewhere upstairs bed springs creek

under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making.

The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN

is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on

the end of the line.

ORTON

(ON PHONE)

Well? What's happening?

COLIN glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say.

COLIN

She's... getting into character.

CUT TO:

Dame Sybil stands alone.

RICHARD WATTIS, ROSAMUND GREENWOOD (MAUD) and TWO FOOTMAN

in full costume, sweating under the hot lights.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 36.

OLIVIER prowls the set smoking impatiently. COLIN is at his

side with DAVID ORTON.

OLIVIER

She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike

waiting in full costume for two

hours. It's simply not fair.

The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on

one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging

shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly

beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her

head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work

on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware

of the scrutiny of the crew.

She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the

weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her

face.

She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her

dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

PAULA

She wasn't happy with her make-

up.

OLIVIER loosens his collar irritably and glances at ORTON.

OLIVIER

Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to

check the back projection. Please

join us, Mr. Cardiff.

He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton.

CUT TO:

COLIN sees SYBIL THORNDIKE standing on set. She beams at

him cheerfully.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Isn't she pretty though?

COLIN

Would you like to sit down, Dame

Sybil?

SYBIL THORNDIKE

How kind of you, Colin. Yes, why

don't we all sit down?

Colin sees her chair by the camera and goes innocently to

fetch it. But as he picks it up he is confronted by a stern

looking crew member in overalls.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 37.

TREVOR

Are you a member of NATTKE?

COLIN

What?

TREVOR

That chair is a prop. Props are

NATTKE. If ACT members are going

to do NATTKE jobs, I'm calling my

men out.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Strike meeting!

SYBIL THORNDIKE

I'm sure we're all good union

members here. There's no need to

fall out over something so

trivial.

TREVOR

It might be trivial to you, Dame

Sybil, but it's my livelihood.

He's not in the union. (Pause, to

Colin) Put the chair down.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Put the chair down now!

SYBIL THORNDIKE

I rather think you've made your

point. Solidarity is the

important thing here. When unions

fall out, it's only management

that benefits.

TREVOR

(TO COLIN)

If I see you doing a NATTKE job

again I'll close this set down

quicker than you can blink.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

I was on the picket lines in

1926, you know.

(MORE)

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 38.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)

Now that was a strike. We were

all Bolsheviks then!

She smiles nostalgically as ORTON appears to hustle COLIN

away, muttering furiously.

ORTON

Didn't they teach you anything at

Eton? Now fuck off and see if you

can get me a bacon sandwich

without starting World War III.

CUT TO:

MARILYN is at last on set and ready to shoot. SYBIL

THORNDIKE, as the Queen Dowager, waits behind a door.

OLIVIER is in front of the camera with MARILYN, who

flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture.

PAULA mutters a last few words in her ear, reading her

lines to her from her small brown notebook.

COLIN watches intently. A bell rings and the red light goes

on. The camera operator, DENYS, rolls the camera.

DENYS

Camera running.

ORTON

Very quiet, everyone...

DENYS

Speed.

The CLAPPER LOADER clicks the clapperboard.

CLAPPERBOY

Twenty two, take one.

ORTON

Action!

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"Now, before you meet my mother-

in-law I must warn you she is a

little vague and can be very

deaf... on occasions."

SYBIL THORNDIKE sweeps through the door right on cue, with

MAUD, her lady-in-waiting, following. She is effortlessly

in command of her lines.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"My dear, such boredom! The

decorations hideous, and the

music... catastrophe! Our friend,

the ex-King of Moravia drove me

home.

(MORE)

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 39.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

(CONT'D)

He is now called the Duke of

Strelitz, he cannot of course go

to the Abbey tomorrow, but he is

most anxious you should invite

him to the room you have taken in

the Ritz for Nicky. Maud?

ROSAMUND GREENWOOD (AS MAUD)

"Yes, Ma'am..."

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"Oh there you are my dear, I did

not see you, give me a glass of

that champagne I see over there.

Olga Bosnia..."

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"Might I present Miss Elsie

Marina?"

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"Oh yes, my dear, of course I

remember you well."

They all look at MARILYN... and nothing happens.

MARILYN

Gee. I forgot my line. I'm sorry.

OLIVIER

Cut.

SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles cheerfully.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

It's so easily done, isn't it?

I'm sure I went wrong somewhere

there too. Shall we have another

go, Larry?

CUT TO:

The clapperboard snaps. Take Five.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"Oh yes, my dear, of course I

remember you well."

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

(HALTING)

"Oh, I'm quite sure you don't,

your royal..., oh, I mean, your,

uh, Imperial... your uh... serene

majesty."

It is not clear whether Marilyn's hesitance is acted or not

but the others press on gamely.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 40.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"What does she say?"

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"She says she is deeply flattered

and compliments you on your

wonderful memory."

MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The

Avenue."

There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Didn't I have a line somewhere

there, dear?

OLIVIER

Cut.

CUT TO:

The clapperboard snaps shut again. Take twelve.

ORTON

Action!

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

"Thank you, my dear. (Pause)

Sweetly pretty. She should use

more mascara. When one is young

one should use a lot of mascara,

and when one is old one should

use much more. What do you do, my

dear?"

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The

Avenue".

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)

(TO OLIVIER)

"Dear?"

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"She says she is an actress."

MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character.

OLIVIER glances at ORTON who nods.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Cut it there.

ORTON

Check the gate.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 41.

FOCUS PULLER

(After a second)

Gate's good.

OLIVIER

Print.

There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set.

SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

That was perfect, Marilyn. You're

Elsie to the life!

MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but

SYBIL carries on with complete conviction.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)

Perhaps we could practise our

lines together later? You'd be

doing me such a kindness. At my

great age it's just so hard to

make them stick! Why don't you

come for tea tomorrow?

In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone

knows it. But it is a kind and tactful gesture. MARILYN's

face lights up.

MARILYN

Can I?

OLIVIER looks at COLIN in dismay.

OLIVIER

She's impossible. I should have

cast Vivien.

COLIN

If anyone can make her great,

it's you. You're a genius.

OLIVIER

Oh, yes. The world's greatest

living actor, so they say.

OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles

for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to

light it. He smiles wryly.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Let's hope I'm as brilliant as

you think I am. (Pause) Now be a

good boy and keep an eye on her.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 42.

MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room.

MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind

them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's

insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's

uncertainty.

MARILYN

I just can't figure this movie out.

PAULA

You were wonderful. You are the

most gifted actress I have ever

known. You were superb, Marilyn.

You were divine.

MARILYN

He was angry with me, I could

tell.

PAULA

You were great. You are a great,

great actress. All my life I have

prayed for a great actress I

could help and guide.

She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the

corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his

path blocked.

PAULA (CONT'D)

Like this. I prayed to God on my

knees. And he has given me you.

You are that great actress,

Marilyn.

MARILYN

Come on, Paula, get up.

PAULA

Not until you admit you were

great.

MARILYN smiles, her mood slowly lightening.

MARILYN

Oh, okay. I guess I was.

COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.

COLIN

You really were very good, Miss

Monroe.

MARILYN smiles vaguely. PAULA gives him a fierce look - COLIN

moves past quickly.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 43.

The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.

Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few

young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an

exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and

the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among

them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them

both a glass.

LUCY

Are you sure you can afford all

this?

COLIN

Oh, it's all right.

LUCY

It must be costing a week's wages.

COLIN

It's worth it.

LUCY can't help being charmed.

LUCY

You're not the average third, are

you? Most of them would be happy

with a swift half and a grope in

the pub car park.

COLIN

I'm not living off my parents, if

that's what you mean. I want to

make my own way, no matter what.

LUCY

By making eyes at Vivien Leigh?

COLIN

Who told you that?

LUCY

Word gets around.

COLIN

Vivien's a friend of my father's.

LUCY

So there's nothing in it? You and

Vivien?

He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids

him coolly.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I'm not that easy.

The WAITER approaches with a bill on a silver salver and

offers him a pen.

WAITER

You'll be signing on your father's

account, sir?

COLIN

Certainly not. I settle my own

bills.

COLIN

I was always going to pay, you

know.

LUCY

Of course you were.

LUCY

Do you think Marilyn is beautiful?

COLIN

Not compared to you.

LUCY

You don't have to try so hard to be

charming. You're nice enough as it

is. Well, you could be.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 44.

She touches his hand and takes a drag from his cigarette as

he refills her glass.

LUCY (CONT'D)

You know Marilyn's really still

in love with Joe DiMaggio?

COLIN

So they say.

LUCY

She married Miller on the

rebound. The papers are calling

them "The Hourglass and the

Egghead".

COLIN

Which one is which?

She bursts out laughing. Her eyes sparkle and she looks

captivating in the glistening lights. He goes to kiss her

and this time she doesn't stop him.

CUT TO:

Colin's Bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined

with pleasant semi-detached houses. Lucy's house has a neat

patch of front lawn, a stolid family car in the drive and

net curtains in the windows. It is very little different

from any of its neighbours.

CUT TO:

COLIN and LUCY are kissing in the small "best" parlour at the

front of the house. It is spotlessly neat and clean.

COLIN touches Lucy's breasts and then opens the buttons of

her blouse. She puts her hand on his, stopping him.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 45.

LUCY

Wait a while, crocodile.

COLIN

I really do like you, Lucy.

LUCY

Maybe.

LUCY (CONT'D)

That's my dad.

MR. ARMSTRONG

Time to be thinking about bed,

darling. Early start tomorrow.

LUCY

Sorry, Daddy. We were just going

over tomorrow's schedule.

COLIN

Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark.

Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.

COLIN (CONT'D)

This is a very nice house you've

got.

MR. ARMSTRONG

Do you know this part of the world?

COLIN

(THROWN)

Umm... not really. My family are

more country people.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Next Saturday?

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 46.

As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at

the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is

uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his

parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he

and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car

with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away.

CUT TO:

COLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws

up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Colin, dear, I thought you looked

cold so I bought you this.

She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched.

COLIN

Thank you, Dame Sybil.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

Film sets and rehearsal rooms are

the coldest places on earth.

He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around

his neck and looks up and down the road again.

CUT TO:

The crew stand around in sullen discontent. OLIVIER paces

back and forth with MILTON at his side.

OLIVIER

She should be on time, like

everyone else.

MILTON

She is a star.

OLIVIER

I'm a fucking star!

He looks around in frustration.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

If we nip this behaviour in the

bud perhaps it won't be repeated.

MILTON

This is Marilyn you're talking

about.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 47.

OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN

finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances

on her, his anger simmering.

OLIVIER

Marilyn, darling you are an

angel, and I kiss the hem of your

garment, but why can't you get

here on time for the love of

fuck?

MARILYN

Oh... you have that word in

England too?

She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite

there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.

PAULA

Marilyn has to prepare properly.

She has to find in herself all

that lies under the surface.

Acting isn't just a case of

putting on a costume or some

ludicrous false nose.

OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's

hand, leading her forward like a child.

OLIVIER

You must apologise to Dame Sybil.

MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm.

CUT TO:

OLIVIER propels MARILYN towards SYBIL THORNDIKE. MARILYN

reddens with humiliation.

MARILYN

I'm sorry...

SYBIL THORNDIKE

(Cutting her off)

My dear, you mustn't concern

yourself. A great actress like

you has many other things on her

mind.

A radiant smile spreads slowly across Marilyn's face as the

older woman's words sink in.

MARILYN

You think I'm a great actress?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 48.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

None of the rest of us truly know

how to act for the camera. But

you do. It is a rare gift.

She looks sharply at OLIVIER.

SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)

This poor girl hasn't had your

years of experience. She is in a

strange country, acting a strange

part. Now, are you helping or

bullying?

OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN

looks on, startled.

CUT TO:

OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS

watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They

watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut

Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is

dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is

an effective but theatrical performance.

MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back

row watching her performance from the same scene. She

fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,

looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand

tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming

and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's

look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and

reassurance.

MILLER

That one's pretty damn good. You

knocked it out of the park.

MARILYN glows at his praise.

MILTON

When Marilyn gets it right you

just don't want to look at anyone

else.

OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will

never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive

Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his

heart.

At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches

MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn

entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on

screen he begins to see things differently.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 49.

He sneaks a look at her in real life. She is holding

MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one

disastrous take follows another.

CUT TO:

COLIN comes out of the viewing theatre behind OLIVIER and

MILTON.

OLIVIER

We've only been shooting for four

days and we're already two weeks

behind.

COLIN can't resist blurting out a comment.

COLIN

Why not only show her the good

takes? Then she might feel better

about herself.

He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.

MILTON

The kid's right. She could use

the confidence.

OLIVIER

I believe it's traditional for

the producer of the film to watch

rushes. Besides, she's an

experienced actress. She should

learn from her mistakes.

COLIN

They just upset her.

OLIVIER

Not half as much as they upset

me.

CUT TO:

COLIN hurries across the stage, carrying a fresh carton of

"Oliviers". ORTON stops him.

ORTON

I'll do that. You go and find

Marilyn's script. She thinks she

left it in her dressing room.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 50.

DAY.

COLIN bursts into the dressing room without knocking.

Clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor. There are

pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with

empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN

rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and

books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open

door into the inner chamber.

And stops dead in his tracks.

MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head.

She is completely naked.

She looks at him in astonishment.

He stares back, equally astounded.

He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,

lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and

a bottle of pills.

COLIN

Your script...

MARILYN

I found it.

Calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it

around herself. She smiles quizzically.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

You can go now, Colin.

He hesitates a beat, surprised that she knows his name,

before he fumbles for the door.

CUT TO:

ROOM/CORRIDOR. DAY.

COLIN slams the door, aghast.

CUT TO:

COLIN and LUCY are buried in the clothes racks kissing

passionately. They surface for air.

COLIN

David wants to know if you're

ready for the extras in the

ballroom scene.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 51.

LUCY

Tell him he can start sending

them up. Women first.

They kiss again. He pulls away.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I'm looking forward to Saturday.

He looks at her uncertainly.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Our date?

COLIN

(AWKWARD)

I forgot. I can't do Saturday.

Marilyn wants to go shopping.

LUCY

Since when do you work for her?

COLIN

Larry asked me to help out.

She smiles sardonically, teasing him, but a little hurt.

LUCY

Well, of course you must do what

Larry says.

COLIN

Next Friday instead?

She shrugs in agreement.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock.

He smiles, a little too glibly, and hurries away. LUCY

gazes after him. He doesn't look back.

CUT TO:

COLIN sits in the front with ROGER driving. MARILYN, ARTHUR

MILLER and MILTON GREENE sit in the back.

CUT TO:

It is very quiet in the normally busy West End. Shops have

begun shutting after lunch and the city is rapidly

emptying. SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of

MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark

glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand. She

glances at MILTON with an awkward laugh.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 52.

MARILYN

Gee, it's quiet.

COLIN

It's Saturday. Early closing. But

they're expecting us.

MILTON

No one's recognised her.

COLIN

At least she can shop in peace.

MILTON

Marilyn's a star. Stars don't

even pee alone.

PASSER-BY

It's Marilyn Monroe!

ROGER

My God, she'll be torn apart...

MILLER

Get her out of here.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53.

MILTON

Jeez, Marilyn, they really

fucking love you.

As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking

his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed

into the seat beside him.

MILLER

Madness. Someone's going to get

hurt.

COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes

meet Marilyn's. He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness

before she quickly replaces her dark glasses.

CUT TO:

COLIN stands silently by the camera, watching MARILYN and

RICHARD WATTIS, in character as Elsie Marina and

Northbrook, open the doors of the Grand Duke's drawing

room.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well we're still the first ones,

aren't we? Gee, this is all

right, isn't it?

OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and

charming.

OLIVIER

Cut. The line is "Gee, this is

all right too, isn't it". It's a

tiny word, my darling, but it

matters. Let's go straight away.

MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last

minute checks.

DENYS

Camera running.

SOUNDMAN

Speed.

DENYS

Mark it.

The clapperboard clatters down. Take two. WATTIS and

MARILYN come in again on their cue.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well we're still the first ones,

aren't we? Gee, this is all

right, isn't it?"

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54.

OLIVIER

Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did

work so very hard on this and we

must try to get it right for him.

Straight away, please.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well, we're still the first

ones, aren't we? Gee, this is...

all right, isn't it?"

OLIVIER

Cut.

MARILYN

Can't we just drop it?

OLIVIER

The point is that you have

already admired the downstairs

hall in an earlier scene. Now you

are admiring this room as well.

MARILYN

Oh, sure. (Pause, she looks

stricken) Paula!

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I don't get it. He's such a

strange man. I think she'd figure

out he only invited her to sleep

with her.

PAULA

(TO OLIVIER)

The reason Marilyn can't remember

the line is because she doesn't

believe the situation her character

is in.

OLIVIER

Then she should pretend to

believe it.

PAULA

Pretend? We're talking about the

difference between the truth and

artificial crap.

OLIVIER

We're in absolute agreement,

Paula. Acting is all about

sincerity. And if you can fake

that, you're off to the races.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 55.

MILTON

Maybe we should try for another

take.

PAULA

Marilyn needs time to give a

great performance. You should

give her as long as it takes.

Chaplin took eight months to make

a movie.

OLIVIER

Eight months of this? I'd rather

kill myself.

MARILYN

I can't do this. I can't.

PAULA

You can do it. You can't fail.

You will have more pain, you will

suffer more but you will create.

All you need is time.

PAULA (CONT'D)

Remember, Marilyn, a tree is

never just a tree. What kind of

tree is Elsie? An elm tree? A

birch tree?

OLIVIER

(Under his breath to

COLIN)

God knows, but I'm a weeping

fucking willow.

PAULA

(TO MARILYN)

Think about the things you like,

instead of him. Frank Sinatra.

Coca Cola. Be specific. The

character comes alive if you know

what you're doing.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 56.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well we're still the first ones,

aren't we? Gee, this is all

right, isn't it?"

OLIVIER

Cut.

A look of near-panic creeps into Marilyn's eyes at her

inability to remember the line.

CUT TO:

78 DELETED 78

The clapperboard snaps one final time. Take twenty three.

MARILYN's smile is a grimace of terror. COLIN can hardly

bear to look. Everyone holds their breath.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well we're still the first ones,

aren't we? (Pause) Gee, this is

all right too, isn't it?"

There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks

around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures

frantically from behind the camera that she should carry

on. She hesitates...

... there is an agonising beat...

... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Paula!

OLIVIER

Cut. What's the matter now?

He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the

set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation

with a honeyed tone.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my

failure, not yours. Tell me how I

can help you.

MARILYN

I don't know who Elsie is. I

can't act her if I don't know who

she is!

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 57.

OLIVIER

Elsie is all in the script

MARILYN

I can't find her. She's not

there.

OLIVIER

But you have her precisely, you

know her inside out. I'm in awe of

your gift. We all are.

MARILYN

She's not real.

OLIVIER

Why not simply rely on your natural

talents?

MARILYN

Are you saying I don't need to

act?

OLIVIER

Marilyn, you are the most

attractive woman in the world.

I'm simply suggesting you be

yourself.

MARILYN

(SHOUTS)

I don't want to be myself!

(Pause) I want to be an actress

playing a character.

OLIVIER

(Trying to be helpful)

All you have to do, dear Marilyn,

is be sexy. Isn't that what you

do?

MARILYN

I want Lee.

OLIVIER

You've already got Paula, for

heaven's sake. I'm the director.

Speak to me.

PAULA

I am only Lee's representative.

OLIVIER

It's five in the morning in New

York.

MARILYN

I WANT LEE!

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 58.

Her furious scream brings all activity to a halt. She storms

off the set with PAULA following. The atmosphere is awful.

DAY.

OLIVIER sits brooding savagely in front of his make-up

mirror with MILTON GREENE. COLIN unobtrusively fetches

whisky and cigarettes for them both as OLIVIER abruptly

booms out to himself.

OLIVIER

"O, now, for ever Farewell the

tranquil mind/Farewell content/

Farewell the plumed troop and the

big wars/That make ambition

virtue O, farewell/Farewell..."

(Pause, exasperated) Paula's not

an actress. She not a director,

not a teacher. Her only talent is

buttering up Marilyn.

MILTON

It would be worse if she wasn't

around.

OLIVIER

You know what would make Marilyn

Monroe a real actor? A season in

rep. They wouldn't stand for this

kind of nonsense at the

Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

MILTON

You have to be patient with her.

OLIVIER

Trying to teach Marilyn how to

act is like teaching Urdu to a

badger.

MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks

up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of

pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it

in his pocket.

MILTON

I better go see her. She'll need

something to help her calm down.

COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.

OLIVIER

(After a second)

Pills to sleep, pills to wake up.

Pills to calm her down, pills to

give her energy. No wonder she's

permanently ten feet underwater.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59.

COLIN looks at him tentatively.

COLIN

Maybe she's scared.

OLIVIER

We're all scared. It's part of

being an actor.

COLIN

But you have the training to deal

with it.

OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.

OLIVIER

I wouldn't buy the little girl

lost act if I were you. Though

heaven knows it's tempting.

He sighs wistfully.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

And I think Marilyn knows exactly

what she's doing.

COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

You better get over to Parkside

and make sure the poor girl's all

right. (Pause) And Colin? Don't

forget who you work for.

CUT TO:

COLIN draws up outside Marilyn's house. The place is dark

and quiet.

CUT TO:

ROGER takes two bottles of beer from the well stocked

drinks cabinet and hands one to COLIN, putting a coaster

for him on the coffee table. COLIN looks around the opulent

drawing room.

COLIN

Are you sure they won't mind?

ROGER

Help yourself. They can spare it.

(Pause) Marilyn's okay. She's

taken some pills and gone to bed.

He frowns darkly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 60.

ROGER (CONT'D)

They like to keep her doped up.

It makes her easier to control.

COLIN

You mean Miller?

ROGER

(Shakes his head)

The others. They're terrified

their cash cow will slip away.

He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle.

ROGER (CONT'D)

Cheers!

CUT TO:

COLIN wakes abruptly from a doze as his empty bottle of

beer rolls to the floor. ROGER is fast asleep. COLIN

glances at the clock. It is nearly midnight.

CUT TO:

COLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow

strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall

in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly.

He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is

totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears

something.

Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow

breaths, like sighs.

COLIN is paralysed.

A beat, then -

A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into

the corridor.

MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall

only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink

bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank

and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook,

its pages closely crammed with handwriting.

MILLER

(OFF)

Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's

not what you think.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61.

She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is

there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice

comes again, flat and tired.

MILLER (CONT'D)

(OFF)

It's just a few ideas. Writer's

stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book

and let's get some sleep.

Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it

to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders

she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door.

As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in

what feels like minutes.

CUT TO:

COLIN, muffled in his scarf, looks up as Marilyn's car

cruises to a halt at the gate.

COLIN

Good morning, Miss Monroe.

She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face

protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side.

She doesn't look up.

CUT TO:

OLIVIER, DAVID ORTON and COLIN huddle around the camera.

JEREMY SPENSER and TECHNICIANS stand around, bored and

listless. MILTON appears. They speak in low, urgent tones.

OLIVIER

It's nearly lunch time.

MILTON

She isn't feeling the part.

OLIVIER

It's a light comedy. How much

feeling can it possibly require?

MILTON

Give her a few minutes...

OLIVIER

She can't hide in her bloody

dressing room all day.

MILTON

Oh, yes she can.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 62.

OLIVIER looks at him angrily. He is close to the end of his

tether.

OLIVIER

(TO COLIN)

Go and find out what the hell's

going on.

DAY.

COLIN knocks softly on the dressing room door. PAULA

appears, opening it no more than a crack. She looks out

suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the

room.

PAULA

It's Colin.

COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider.

PAULA (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Come in. Marilyn wants to see

you.

COLIN stares at her in surprise.

CUT TO:

DAY.

COLIN comes in. The dressing room is in semi-darkness.

PAULA settles down in the corner. MARILYN lies on a sofa,

wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are

scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long

pause. She sighs softly.

MARILYN

How old are you?

COLIN

24. (Pause) Nearly

MARILYN

You remind us of the young king in

the movie. Kind of honest and

innocent.

COLIN

(WOUNDED)

I'm not innocent.

She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into

the light.

MARILYN

What's your job on this picture?

COLIN

I'm the third assistant director.

Just a gopher really. Go for

this, go for that...

MARILYN

You're Larry's assistant too.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

What were you doing in my house

last night? Did he send you?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63.

COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.

COLIN

He was worried about you.

MARILYN

Are you spying on me?

COLIN

No! Of course not. Why would

anyone spy on you?

She sighs, and looks away.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Are you all right, Miss Monroe?

He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But

then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.

MARILYN

Colin? Whose side are you on?

COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and

vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer

anyone could give.

COLIN

Yours, Miss Monroe.

She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face

lighting up.

MARILYN

Call me Marilyn.

He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks

so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is

on her side now.

CUT TO:

As COLIN walks down through the studio he meets RICHARD

WATTIS with PAUL HARDWICK, on their way to wardrobe. WATTIS

winks at him.

WATTIS

Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.

Larry will get jealous.

HARDWICK

You can say that again.

He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a

lightness he doesn't feel.

COLIN

Nothing happened.

WATTIS

You were in there for ten minutes

at least. Plenty of time for a

kiss and a cuddle.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 64.

COLIN

Paula was with us the whole time.

WATTIS

The mind boggles, dear.

COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to

see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.

CUT TO:

MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance

routine. Released from the need to remember any words she

takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in

her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,

mildly silly and charming all at the same time.

The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina

isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates

joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and

MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the

actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the

doorway.

Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one

can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely

joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn

is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his

face as he watches.

CUT TO:

The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit

in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours

whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both

men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about.

MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.

MILLER

I dreamed last night I could hear

singing. And then I realised it

wasn't a dream. There was a male

voice choir serenading Marilyn

under our window. At two in the

morning. It's a circus. A freak

show.

OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.

MILLER (CONT'D)

I'm going back to New York for a

few days. I need to see my kids.

I need a break.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65.

OLIVIER

That won't help Marilyn.

MILLER

(After a moment)

I can't help her. (Pause) You

know what she loves to do most?

Sleep. It's what she lives for.

Sleep is her demon.

MILLER (CONT'D)

I've disappointed her.

MILLER (CONT'D)

She thought I could smash all her

insecurities with one magical

stroke. That I could make her a

new person.

MILLER (CONT'D)

She wants me to protect her but I

can't. I can't even protect

myself. (Pause) She read some

notes I made. They were nothing.

Just a few ideas.

OLIVIER

About her?

MILLER

She took them the wrong way.

OLIVIER

But you do love her? Your new

bride and all that?

MILLER

I can't work. I can't think.

(Pause) She's devouring me.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 66.

Early morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising

towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat.

VIVIEN

Hello, Colin darling. You look

like Horatio defending the

bridge. Are you going to let me

in?

CUT TO:

VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets

everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of

Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks

at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and

relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.

VIVIEN

I hope Larry isn't making you all

work too hard. I know what a

dreadful slave driver he can be.

She sees ORTON and takes his hands.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

David, he would be lost without

you.

ORTON

Just doing my job.

Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK

CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock

misery.

VIVIEN

I'm getting old, Jack. I need you

to work your miracles on me.

CARDIFF

You're more beautiful every year,

Vivien.

She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely.

VIVIEN

Now, you are looking after Larry

like I told you?

COLIN

I'm doing my best...

VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward

and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears

only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67.

Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides

towards her, hands extended.

VIVIEN

Darling Marilyn!

She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

Larry tells me you are quite,

quite superb. I'm wild with

jealousy.

MARILYN

Oh, but everyone says you were a

wonderful Elsie on stage.

VIVIEN

But I'm too old to play her in

the film. Larry was quite brutal

about that. You see, the truth is

all that matters to him. That's

why we all admire him so very

much.

She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles

back with a haunted look in his eyes.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

Now, I must let you work. I only

came to wish you good luck!

Goodbye, everyone!

The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more

than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge

of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is

totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN

comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.

VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and

she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade

of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at

him with bitter disappointment.

VIVIEN (CONT'D)

Oh, Colin. Not you too.

He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.

CUT TO:

BOOTH. DAY.

COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The

screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince

And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in

gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a

toast to the American President.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 68.

VIVIEN

I didn't think she would be so

beautiful. She... shines on that

screen.

OLIVIER

You shouldn't upset yourself. You

are ten times the actress she

will ever be.

VIVIEN

If you could see yourself. The

way you watch her...

OLIVIER

There's never been anything

between Marilyn and me.

VIVIEN

Only because she didn't want you.

OLIVIER

You're imagining things.

VIVIEN

Do you think I'm a fool? You

didn't think the little tart

could resist the great Laurence

Olivier.

VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

But she saw through you, didn't she

darling? Take away the actor and

what's left of the man? You can't

even play the husband properly

without a script.

(slaps him hard across the

face. )

I hope she makes your life hell!

OLIVIER

Vivien..!

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 69.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

She hasn't been well. There was a

baby... she... we... lost it...

COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

(After a pause)

Do you have a cigarette, Colin?

COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER

grimaces wryly.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Not one of those awful things.

COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to

OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales

deeply.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Vivien's right... I did think I

would fall shatteringly in love

with Marilyn. What a joke.

He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Remember, boy, when it comes to

women you are never too old for

humiliation.

CUT TO:

The set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again

there is no sign of Marilyn. The actors, RICHARD WATTIS and

PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full

costume, while ORTON stands with his arms folded.

Technicians chat or sit idly. As COLIN watches, OLIVIER

looks across at MILTON who shrugs hopelessly.

CUT TO:

ROOM/PARKSIDE. DAY.

COLIN pours whisky for OLIVIER. MILTON comes in.

MILTON

Marilyn won't shoot today. She's

gone back to Parkside. She's

upset about Arthur leaving

England.

OLIVIER

He's only going to visit his

children.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70.

MILTON

You don't leave Marilyn alone.

She can't handle it. She thinks

everyone's going to abandon her.

OLIVIER

Perhaps she's come back. (Into the

phone) Yes?

ROGER

(OFF)

Sir Laurence? It's Roger.

OLIVIER

Oh, Roger. What's up?

ROGER

(OFF)

Is Colin there, Sir?

OLIVIER

Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for

you.

COLIN

Roger?

MARILYN

(ON PHONE)

Colin, why don't you drop by here

on your way home?

MILTON

What the heck?

OLIVIER

Why is Marilyn on the phone to my

third fucking assistant?

COLIN

Yes, I'm sure I can do that.

MARILYN

(ON PHONE)

Good. Don't tell anyone though.

OLIVIER

Well? What did she want?

COLIN

She wants to see me.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 71.

He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic.

MILTON

He shouldn't be talking to her.

He's just a kid. Supposing he

says something? (Pause) Why the

hell didn't she call me?

His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast

to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest,

wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that

can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly.

OLIVIER

I'm sure Colin knows what he's

doing. Don't you, Colin?

There is a warning as well as approval in his tone.

CUT TO:

ROGER leads COLIN into the formal drawing room.

ROGER

Miss Monroe said for you to wait.

She won't be long.

He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is

nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He

looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and

is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the

brandy and picks it up -

MARILYN

(OFF)

Help yourself to a drink.

COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,

casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a

pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.

COLIN

I was just... checking you've got

everything you need.

She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away

from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his

gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks

up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the

decanter from his hand.

MARILYN

Here, let me.

She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Are you frightened of me, Colin?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 72.

COLIN

No.

MARILYN

Good. Because I like you.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I want you to help me. Will you

do that?

COLIN

I'm only the third. Just a

messenger, really.

MARILYN

But you know what's going on. You

can see both sides of the

situation.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I want you to be honest. Tell me

everything.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Relax. I thought you weren't

scared of me. (Pause) Are you

hungry? I'll have them send in a

tray. I'm starved.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I

interrupting something? Maybe you

have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you

at home?

COLIN

There's no Mrs. Colin.

MARILYN

So we can talk as long as we

like?

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Why is Sir Olivier so mean?

He talks to me as if he's

slumming.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73.

COLIN

I'll tell you what's wrong. It's

agony for him because he's a

great actor who wants to be a

film star, and agony for you

because you're a film star who

wants to be a great actress. And

this film won't help either of

you.

MARILYN

Are you sure you can handle that?

You don't look old enough to

drink.

COLIN

I'm 23, Miss Monroe.

MARILYN

It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I

guess that makes me an old lady

to you.

COLIN

Seven years is nothing.

MARILYN

Do you know I've been married

three times already? How did that

happen?

COLIN

You were just looking for the

right man.

MARILYN

They always look right at the

start.

COLIN

Hello?

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 74.

MILTON sits at his desk. He leans forward anxiously at the

sound of Colin's voice.

MILTON

Colin? Is everything okay? What

did she want?

CUT BACK TO:

COLIN looks at MARILYN and hesitates.

COLIN

Everything's fine. Miss Monroe

just had... some large packages

she needed handling...

He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back

innocently and mouths the word "packages". She giggles. He

turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own

laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes

shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.

He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in

irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself

together.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Hello? Milton?

There is a long silence at the other end of the line.

CUT TO:

MILTON turns pale. When he speaks again his anger is just

barely under control.

MILTON

Let me speak to her, Colin.

CUT BACK TO:

COLIN offers the phone to MARILYN but she shakes her head.

COLIN

She's tied up right now.

This only sets MARILYN off again. She howls with laughter and

COLIN can't help joining her.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 75.

MILTON stares at the phone in disbelief.

MILTON

What's going on? Colin! (Shouts)

Let me talk to her, damn it!

CUT BACK TO:

COLIN looks at MARILYN but she shakes her head between

giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the

words out between snorts of laughter.

COLIN

I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.

He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN

smiles.

MARILYN

Let's walk in the garden. See if

we can find any more reporters in

the bushes.

She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes

his arm.

There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.

MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the

path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical

closeness.

MARILYN

I didn't know it was so pretty

out here.

COLIN

You should get out more. See the

sights.

MARILYN

I am the sights.

She giggles again, her mood lighter.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Look at us. We're just like

Elsie and the young King. What

would Sir Laurence say if he

could see us now?

COLIN

I don't think he'd mind.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.

MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a

friendly way as they walk.

MARILYN

I wanted to be an artist. To

grow as an actor. I was so proud

to be working with the great

Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks

I'm the enemy.

She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.

COLIN

He doesn't understand your kind

of actor. He's hated the method

ever since Vivien worked with

Elia Kazan. It's all too new and

strange. You're the future, and

it frightens him.

MARILYN

Every time I walk into the studio

I feel this sense of doom come

over me. He looks at me like

he's smelling a pile of rotten

fish. And the crew hate me.

Paula is the only person I can

trust. (Pause) Except for you

now, maybe.

She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses

swim as he stares into them...

... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.

ROGER

Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.

It's Mr. Miller.

MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing

back briefly at Colin.

MARILYN

Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for

telling me the truth.

COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises

that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.

ROGER

You'll be leaving now, I expect.

CUT TO:

DAY.

The next morning. COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to

MILTON.

OLIVIER

I don't care if he fucks her

sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her

down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

I hear you spent last night with

Marilyn.

COLIN

I didn't spend the night with

her. We just had a chat.

MILTON

I heard them chuckling.

OLIVIER

Perhaps if Colin is very

diplomatic Marilyn is more likely

to behave herself.

COLIN

She just wants a chum, that's

all.

MILTON

A chum? Jesus Christ, what is

this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,

kid.

OLIVIER

I thought working with Marilyn

would make me feel young again.

But I look dead in the rushes.

Dead behind the eyes.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Perhaps I'm angry with her

because in my heart I know my own

career is in a terrible rut. I

wanted to renew myself through

her but all I see reflected in

that magnificent face is my own

inadequacy.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

You know, I admire Marilyn. I

really do. Despite her behaviour.

She has taken everything

Hollywood can throw at her and

triumphed.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

An actress has to be pretty tough

to get even a tenth as far as she

has.

He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and

sympathetic.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

But be careful, boy. She doesn't

need to be rescued. Not really.

CUT TO:

Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at

the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is

greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,

PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

SOUNDMAN

What was Marilyn like then, Col?

HARDWICK

Going over her lines with her,

were you?

SOUNDMAN

Will she be in today or is she

too tired?

It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely

protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.

COLIN

She was just being friendly.

WATTIS

I'll bet.

There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner

only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.

WATTIS (CONT'D)

Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap?

There you are, Colin the innocent

little fly buzzing about happily,

when suddenly a heavenly scent

attracts you and - Snap!

COLIN

Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've

never slept with a woman in your

life.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 79.

WATTIS

I know a Femme Fatale when I see

one, love.

A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as

MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume

attended to by LUCY.

ORTON

Three minutes, ladies and gents.

Three minutes.

It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date

with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently

behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an

angry MILTON.

MILTON

Arthur Miller called me. He's not

happy with you.

COLIN

He doesn't even know who I am.

MILTON

Marilyn must have said something.

COLIN

Maybe she was trying to make him

jealous...

ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind

the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.

MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside

the studio door.

MILTON

Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn

for seven years. I fell in love

with her, just like you've done.

COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.

MILTON (CONT'D)

We had ten days together and that

was it. She picked me up, she put

me down. That's what she does.

She breaks hearts. She'll break

yours. My advice to you is to

quit before you get burned.

COLIN

I don't need your advice. And I'm

not in love with her.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80.

MILTON

Okay, have it your way. (Pause)

You don't see Marilyn again, you

don't even talk to her. She is

completely off-limits to you. Got

it?

CUT TO:

COLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he

sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She

gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled.

LUCY

I waited for you on Friday.

COLIN

Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot...

I've just been so busy.

LUCY

(SHARP)

So I hear.

COLIN

(SHRUGS)

You know how crews gossip.

There's nothing in it.

LUCY

Of course there isn't. Marilyn

Monroe fancying you? Come on.

COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted

the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like

the idea being dismissed so lightly.

Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.

Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them

in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and

her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.

MARILYN

Hi, Colin.

COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,

looking at Lucy.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Hey, are you guys dating? That's

what I heard.

She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing

fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks

in hard. He shrugs casually.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 81.

COLIN

Of course not. You know how crews

like to gossip.

His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating

what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.

MARILYN

Too bad. You look cute together.

She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.

COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There

are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.

LUCY

I thought you were different.

COLIN

Lucy, I really like you. We've had

such fun...

LUCY

And now it's time to set your

sights a little higher. I get it.

(Pause) Who do you think you are,

Cary Grant?

She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe

department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in

the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an

unworthy sense of relief.

CUT TO:

COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and

collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats

up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands

then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to

block it out.

CUT TO:

The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along,

snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors

to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside

him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.

ROGER

Get in.

COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and

MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.

MILTON

Any problem, Roger?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82.

ROGER

Just dropped by to take Colin out

to lunch.

MILTON

You're not taking him to Marilyn?

That would drop us all in a whole

ocean of shit.

ROGER

Oh, no, sir.

MILTON

What do you have in there?

ROGER

Just a picnic. We've been looking

forward to it, haven't we, Colin?

MILTON

Okay, well, have a nice time boys.

COLIN

Is she okay?

MARILYN

SURPRISE!

COLIN

Oh, Jesus -

MARILYN

Roger and I decided to take you out

for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?

ROGER

(PAINED)

Indeed we did.

COLIN

Oh, God. If Milton sees me with

you... I'll be sacked...

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 83.

MARILYN

No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause)

Except me, of course.

She pats the seat next to her.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I don't like being on my own in the

back.

Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running

back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.

MILTON

What the hell?

He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries

herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over

into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and

the car roars off.

MILTON (CONT'D)

(SHOUTS)

Colin! Get back here, you little

bastard! You're fired! Do you hear

me? Fired!

COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN

emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.

MARILYN

Do you think he saw me?

COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back

seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to

make room for him.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Snuggle up. This is fun.

She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands

meshed together.

ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his

eyes.

In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches

the car speed away.

CUT TO:

112 DELETED 112

COLIN and MARILYN walk barefoot in the grass of Windsor

Great Park while ROGER leans on the bonnet of the parked

Wolsey, holding shoes, socks, and sandals.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 84.

There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass

is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to

the sun.

MARILYN

This is how I ought to feel every

day.

COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Let's run away together.

He turns ashen.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

(LAUGHS)

Just kidding.

She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.

COLIN

We have today, anyway. One day to

do whatever we like. We can go

back to real life tomorrow.

MARILYN

Only one day?

COLIN

Well, maybe the weekend.

MARILYN

Or a week?

He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his

side.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

What shall we do?

COLIN

We could go to Windsor Castle, if

you like.

MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.

CUT TO:

The car makes its stately progress down the magnificent

drive towards the castle.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 85.

ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to

the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty.

ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of

their own.

ROGER

Detective Chief Superintendant

Smith. I'm escorting this lady

and gentleman for the day. They'd

like to look around the castle.

As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.

POLICEMAN

Christ, is that..?

He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.

ROGER

Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors,

is it?

POLICEMAN

(After a second)

Does she know anyone here, sir?

We need to write down a contact

name in the book.

ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.

ROGER

You don't know Her Majesty, by

any chance?

MARILYN

We met at a movie premiere. She

said my dress was pretty.

POLICEMAN

I'm not sure that quite...

COLIN

(INTERRUPTING)

My Godfather works here. He's the

Royal librarian, Sir Owen

Morshead.

The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.

POLICEMAN

Name?

COLIN

Clark. Colin Clark.

The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on

the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86.

COLIN (CONT'D)

My father knows everybody.

A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.

POLICEMAN

He says to go straight up the

hill, sir. You'll be met at the

door.

CUT TO:

COLIN and MARILYN are led by a FOOTMAN down the long

corridor. MARILYN looks awed by the ancient suits of armour

standing regally along the way. COLIN watches her, enjoying

her reaction.

CUT TO:

COLIN and MARILYN are led into another corridor, this one

with a beautiful gold-leaf ceiling decoration. MARILYN looks

up, enchanted.

CUT TO:

The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from

floor to ceiling with books and prints. Every surface is

covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to

antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the

Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a

sly wit. He greets COLIN with a friendly, distracted air.

MORSHEAD

Colin, my boy! Come in, come in.

Forgive the dust.

He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of

recognising her.

MORSHEAD (CONT'D)

You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure

you and Colin have so much in

common.

MARILYN looks around in awe.

MARILYN

Gee, I'd love to read all these

books some time.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 87.

MORSHEAD

Luckily one doesn't really have

to. A lot of them just have

pictures in.

MORSHEAD (CONT'D)

These are by an artist called

Holbein.

MARILYN

She's beautiful.

MORSHEAD

She was the daughter of one of

the King's courtiers, nearly 400

years ago.

MARILYN

I hope I look that good when I'm

400.

MORSHEAD

And these are all by Leonardo Da

Vinci.

MARILYN

I've heard of him! Didn't he

paint that lady with the funny

smile?

MORSHEAD

The Mona Lisa.

MARILYN

Do you have that one here too?

MORSHEAD

Alas, that one got away.

MORSHEAD (CONT'D)

Now, let's go to the Queen's

apartments. She's not here at the

moment, but she will be sorry to

have missed you.

MARILYN

Really?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 88.

MORSHEAD

Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying

to me the other day, "what must

it be like to be the most famous

woman on earth"?

He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who

Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company. He

leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake.

MORSHEAD (CONT'D)

Some of the rooms are very

opulent but I think there's

something you might like better

than all that.

CUT TO:

117 DELETED 117

OPEN on a massive dolls' house. Everything imaginable is

inside - beds, chairs, baths, basins, even small rugs and

chandeliers, all perfectly to scale. MARILYN kneels in

front of it, gazing from room to room with childlike joy.

It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in

every room. She cries out with joy.

MARILYN

Look, Colin.

COLIN kneels at her side.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I sure never had a dolls' house

like this when I was a kid.

She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and

two children. She points at them, her eyes shining.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

This is me, that's you, and these

are our kids.

She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Our daughter's so pretty. All

little girls should be told how

pretty they are. They should grow

up knowing how much their mother

loves them.

Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

We look like such a happy family,

don't we?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89.

She turns to him. They are only inches away from each

other. COLIN's heart lurches. MORSHEAD coughs discreetly.

MORSHEAD

You mustn't let me keep you. I'm

sure you're longing to be on your

way.

CUT TO:

COLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN,

SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers

as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she

smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.

MARILYN

Shall I be "her"?

She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,

shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn

"look". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN

stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a

star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be

leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.

SPECTATOR

Are you somebody, mate?

COLIN

(SMILES)

I'm no one.

COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles,

just for him. He feels like he's tumbling into the abyss,

but no longer cares.

EXT. ETON COLLEGE. DAY.

Roger's car pulls up outside Eton College.

CUT TO:

COLIN and an astonished MARILYN walk through the school

buildings with ROGER a discreet distance behind them.

MARILYN

This isn't a school, it's a

palace!

COLIN smiles.

COLIN

Eton is 500 years old. It was

founded by King Henry VI.

MARILYN

It's like walking through history.

COLIN

Take that room up there.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90.

COLIN

That's where the boys were sent

if they didn't work hard enough.

Where we were whipped.

MARILYN

Whipped?

COLIN

Beaten.

MARILYN

I'd never send my kids away.

(pause) How long were you here?

COLIN

Five years. But I was sent to

boarding school when I was eight.

MARILYN

Why?

COLIN

That's what we do in my family.

MARILYN

It seems to me that you've had most

things pretty easy.

COLIN

In one way, yes. But when you're

brought up in a house of over-

achievers, it's hard to make your

own mark.

MARILYN

So how are you going to do it?

COLIN

Maybe it will be in films, but if

not, there are so many

possibilities out there.

MARILYN

Sounds pretty good to me.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A.

He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then

he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.

SCHOOLBOY

Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!

CUT TO:

MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton

students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy

on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window.

MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into

the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with

difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave

goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.

MARILYN

Work hard, boys! I don't want

anyone whipping you!

A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.

BOY

You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!

MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN

escorts her away.

CUT TO:

ROGER leans back against the car, smoking calmly.

CUT TO:

After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the

peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the

sandy bank. The water glitters magically.

MARILYN

Hurry up, slow poke.

COLIN

But we haven't got any...

He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her

blouse and throwing it off carelessly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91.

He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her

clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed

behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and

MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.

MARILYN

Oh my gosh! It's freezing!

CUT TO:

MARILYN swims in the water, humming softly to herself.

COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs.

MARILYN

This is great.

COLIN

What if a boat goes past? We

could be arrested.

MARILYN

Don't worry. Roger will fix it.

Oh, darn it...

She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.

COLIN

What's wrong?

MARILYN

I have something in my eye.

He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under

the water. She holds her head up to him.

COLIN

I can't see anything.

MARILYN

Get closer.

She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and

suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before

he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

That's the first time I've kissed

anyone younger than me. There's a

lot of older guys in Hollywood.

She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-

conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.

Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the

shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances

away, embarrassed.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 92.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing

you haven't seen before.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Oh, Colin! And you an old

Etonian!

COLIN

Let me warm you up.

CLOSER -

MARILYN

Don't spoil it.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I want this to be the perfect

date.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I haven't had a real date since I

was 13 years old.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

That was nice. I don't get kissed

much.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 93.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Okay, what do we do now?

COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the

real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet

cough and ROGER appears.

ROGER

Time to go home, I think, Miss

Monroe.

She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him

as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his

eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at

each other for a second.

ROGER (CONT'D)

Be careful not to get in too

deep, son.

COLIN knows he isn't talking about the river.

CUT TO:

MARILYN and COLIN sit in silence in the back of the car.

Her exuberance has vanished and there is a distant look in

her eye. COLIN wants to say something but can't think of

the right words. He puts his hand on hers and she squeezes

it, but then pulls away.

CUT TO:

A seething MILTON is waiting on the steps as ROGER parks

the car. COLIN looks at him nervously. MARILYN looks at him

then gets out, glancing at Milton indifferently.

MARILYN

Hi Milton.

She smiles sweetly.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Next time I come on set, you

better make sure Colin is there.

He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

(TO ROGER)

Take him home.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 94.

She waves briefly to Colin, nothing more than a flutter of

her fingers. COLIN watches her all the way up the steps

until she disappears inside.

CUT TO:

The crew are ready, the cast stand around in full costume,

OLIVIER paces the set - and there is no sign of Marilyn.

OLIVIER turns to COLIN.

OLIVIER

You spent the day with her. What

frame of mind was she in?

COLIN

She was fine.

OLIVIER

(HUGE SELF-CONTROL)

Well, find out what's going on.

There's a good chap. Perhaps we

can persuade her on this splendid

day to do the work she's paying

herself to do.

He stalks off. COLIN sees WATTIS grinning at him.

COLIN

Don't start, Dicky.

WATTIS

You won't get any sympathy from

me, dear. Frankly I wouldn't care

if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow.

COLIN

She's trying her best.

WATTIS

She's Marilyn Monroe. This is her

life. Pills, booze, sex, more

pills. (Pause) God, it must be

wonderful!

COLIN doesn't laugh. WATTIS looks at him sympathetically.

WATTIS (CONT'D)

Oh, dear. Little Colin's in love.

CUT TO:

MILTON is waiting for COLIN at the door.

MILTON

Marilyn's not well.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 95.

COLIN

But she was wonderful yesterday.

MILTON

I don't know what you did to her,

kid, but she got nervous. I had

to give her some pills to calm

her down.

COLIN

She doesn't need pills! She just

needs someone to care for her.

MILTON

Someone like you?

COLIN

I told you, I'm not in love with

her!

MILTON

You kissed her.

COLIN

She said that?

MILTON

Spare me the bullshit. I know

everything.

MILTON (CONT'D)

You messed her up, kid. Confused

her.

MILTON (CONT'D)

I've got every penny I ever made

tied up in Marilyn. She owes me.

If it wasn't for me she'd still

be on contracts that make slave

wages look good. I gave her back

her freedom, and now Miller's

turning her against me. That's

what you get for trying to help

Marilyn Monroe.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 96.

MILTON (CONT'D)

If you want to play with the

grown-ups, Colin, start learning

the rules.

CUT TO:

A gentle summer breeze lifts the net curtains. COLIN is

fast asleep. There's a sharp rap at the door.

ROGER

(OFF)

Colin! (Pause) Colin!

COLIN opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep.

COLIN

Roger? What's the matter?

ROGER

(OFF)

It's Marilyn.

A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out

of bed and opens the door. ROGER stands in the doorway

COLIN

Is she dead?

ROGER

She's asking for you. She's sick.

I think she might be in a coma.

COLIN

How can she be asking for me if

she's in a coma?

ROGER

Just bloody get dressed!

CUT TO:

ROGER and COLIN drive up. MILTON, waits on the steps. He

looks resentfully at COLIN but doesn't say anything.

CUT TO:

PAULA STRASBERG paces frantically outside Marilyn's bedroom

door as ROGER, MILTON and COLIN hurry up the stairs.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 97.

PAULA

She hasn't made a sound for over

an hour.

ROGER

We should break down the door.

COLIN

How many pills did she take?

MILTON

Oh, Jesus, who knows? I wasn't

counting.

COLIN knocks gently.

COLIN

Marilyn?

There is no reply.

CUT TO:

ROGER and COLIN carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel

and prop it up against the wall.

ROGER

That's her window.

He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins

up the ladder while ROGER holds it.

COLIN

I'll open the door once I'm

inside.

CUT TO:

COLIN tumbles in through the window with a clattering

thump.

COLIN

Marilyn?

A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the

bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill

and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser;

there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her

mother Gladys.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Marilyn?

For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she

groans and sits up, looking at him blearily.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 98.

MARILYN

Oh hi, Colin.

COLIN

Are you okay? Everyone was

worried about you.

MARILYN

Phooey.

She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily

on the pillow.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Get in.

She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the

door. He searches for the key on the side table and quickly

finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses,

looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends

down to whisper at the keyhole.

COLIN

It's me. She's fine but I'm going

to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep

on the sofa.

MILTON

(OFF)

Come on, Colin, open up.

COLIN

(After a second)

I can't find the key. (Pause) You

can all go to bed now.

PAULA

(OFF)

Colin, open this door! She needs

me...

COLIN goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping

Marilyn, his expression suffused with a tenderness we have

never seen in him before. He pulls up the sheet so that it

covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest

his head on the pillow.

CUT TO:

COLIN wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding

him.

MARILYN

Colin? What are you doing here?

MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her

expression panicky and disoriented. COLIN hurls himself off

the bed.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 99.

COLIN

I came in through the window...

COLIN (CONT'D)

Milton thought you were sick.

MARILYN

The window? Is there a balcony,

like in Romeo And Juliet? How

romantic. (Pause) But I'm not

sick. What makes them think that?

COLIN

Please don't take any more pills.

COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Who's that?

MARILYN

My mom.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

They took her to the Sanatorium

when I was a kid. I grew up in

other people's homes, mostly.

COLIN

Abraham Lincoln?

MARILYN

I don't know who my father is so

it might as well be him. Why not?

I can pick any father I want.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Do you have a home, Colin? A real

one?

COLIN

Yes, I do.

MARILYN

And a mother and father who still

live together?

COLIN

Yes.

MARILYN

And do they love you?

COLIN

I'm sure they do.

MARILYN

You're lucky.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Do you love me, Colin?

COLIN

Yes.

COLIN (CONT'D)

But you and I come from different

worlds. You're like some Greek

Goddess to me...

MARILYN

I'm not Greek.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I don't want to be a Goddess. I

just want to be loved like an

ordinary girl.

COLIN

Mr. Miller loves you.

MARILYN

I found his notebook. It said I'd

let him down.

COLIN

Writers scribble all kinds of

things. It doesn't mean anything.

MARILYN

He wanted me to find it. It said

he should never have married me.

That I was unpredictable and a

woman-child, flighty and self-

centred. He's left me, Colin. Why

do the people I love always leave

me?

COLIN

I'll never leave you.

MARILYN

All people ever see is Marilyn

Monroe. As soon as they realise

I'm not her, they run.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Boy, there's a lot of men in this

business. And they all think

you've got to sleep with them.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

You're not like that. That's why

I like you.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

You should date that Wardrobe

lady. She's pretty.

COLIN

I don't want to. (Pause) I love

you, Marilyn.

MARILYN

What's the matter? Don't you want

to make love?

COLIN

Maybe we should just be friends.

MARILYN

Okay. Friends.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

This is nice. Like spoons. I used

to do this with Johnny.

COLIN

Who's Johnny?

MARILYN

Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in

the old days. He was thin, like

you...

COLIN

Marilyn?

COLIN (CONT'D)

Do one thing for me? Come into

the studio on time tomorrow and

show everybody what you can do.

Show Larry you're a great

actress.

MARILYN

(BLURRED)

Okay.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 103.

First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to

hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her

through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath,

her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz

tune she is to sing in the film.

MARILYN

"I found a dream and lay in your

arms the whole night through...

I'm yours no matter what others

may say or do...

She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.

CUT TO:

COLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a

few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance.

The great man leans out of the back window.

OLIVIER

Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you

look rough.

He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Let me know when Marilyn arrives.

If she ever does.

COLIN

Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in

this morning.

OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.

CUT TO:

MARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken

Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and

Northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a VALET plays the

violin in the doorway behind him.

WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)

"Your Grand Ducal Highness.."

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"This is intolerable"!

WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)

"With the deepest respect, sir,

my message was so important I had

no choice but to intrude".

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 104.

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"Revolution?"

WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)

"No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has

been in a motor accident. The

hospital is calling for her most

urgently."

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go

away, you silly man."

WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)

"Miss Marina, your aunt... you

realise how serious her condition

is?"

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"Well, it's her own fault. She

has no right being out at this

time of night. She's 93!"

MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them,

can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON

behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.

ORTON

Cut it there!

MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out

COLIN amongst the crowd and beams at him. Half the crew,

including OLIVIER, notice the look. COLIN blushes self-

consciously but we can feel his pride.

CUT TO:

NIGHT.

OLIVIER takes off his make-up. COLIN stands behind him with

the end of day bottle of whisky. OLIVIER is in buoyant

mood. It has been a good day.

OLIVIER

Whatever it was you did to her,

boy, keep doing it.

OLIVIER grins slyly and COLIN doesn't bother to protest.

The phone rings. OLIVIER picks it up.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Hello?

His face falls as he listens to the voice at the other end

of the line.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 105.

COLIN paces nervously up and down the hall. PAULA appears.

She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks

with sudden ferocity.

PAULA

From the first moment all I have

felt is Olivier's loathing and

contempt. He thinks I'm

unnecessary. Me, her drama coach,

surrogate mother, nursemaid. On

call 24 hours a day to help her

act, dole out pills, bolster her

ego, keep her sober enough to work.

(Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No

me, no Marilyn.

He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then

walks on. COLIN hesitates. She looks back briefly.

PAULA (CONT'D)

You can come up now.

CUT TO:

MARILYN lies in bed with MILTON possessively at her side.

COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her

eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands

on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his

hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.

MARILYN

You think I can act, don't you,

Colin?

COLIN

Of course I do. You were

wonderful today.

PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.

PAULA

Marilyn's tired now.

MARILYN

I want him to stay with me.

MILTON

What would Arthur say if he knew

Colin was here?

A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on

them angrily.

COLIN

You heard what she said. She

wants me here.

PAULA

You have no idea of your position

in the world, Marilyn. You are the

greatest actress there's ever been.

Not just actress. The greatest

woman of this or any time. I love

you like a daughter.

PAULA (CONT'D)

It's hard now, but believe me you

will survive this and go on to

better things. Your life is ahead

of you. You're young, just

beginning.

MARILYN

I'm so tired of feeling scared.

Life is so shitty. I hate it. It

hurts too much.

COLIN

I'm here now. I'll look after

you.

MARILYN

Good old Colin. Looking after me,

looking after Larry, looking after

Vivien. Always putting everyone

before yourself.

CUT TO:

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 107.

COLIN wakes with a start as he realises that MARILYN is

screaming in pain.

MARILYN

It hurts! It hurts, Colin!

She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and

frightened. COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

The baby. I can't lose the baby.

COLIN looks at her aghast.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

It's a surprise. For Arthur.

Don't tell anyone. Promise me.

He hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door.

CUT TO:

NIGHT.

MILTON and COLIN wait by the bathroom in Marilyn's suite.

ROGER hurries in.

ROGER

The doctor's coming.

COLIN turns the handle but the bathroom door is locked.

COLIN

Marilyn, unlock the door.

MARILYN

(OFF)

Don't let anyone in.

COLIN

I won't.

MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about

anything except Marilyn. There is a shuffling sound and the

door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing

in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.

PAULA

Marilyn! Marilyn, my baby, what

has Colin done to you?

COLIN

I haven't done anything. She's

just... got a stomach ache.

He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 108.

ROGER

I think he means her monthlies.

PAULA

What will Arthur say if she dies?

COLIN

She's not dying, for Christ's

sake.

The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man

at her side. He nods briskly.

CONNELL

I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient

in there?

PAULA

Please save her... it's Marilyn

Monroe. You can't let her die.

CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp.

CONNELL

Perhaps you'd all like to give us

a little privacy?

As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him

bitterly.

MILTON

Happy now, kid?

CUT TO:

DR. CONNELL stands in the hall outside the bedroom writing

out a prescription and smoking a cigarette. He tears the

prescription off the pad and looks up.

CONNELL

Who's in charge here?

MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one.

CONNELL gives them a wry look and shrugs.

CONNELL (CONT'D)

I've given Mrs. Miller an

injection and the bleeding has

stopped. She needs to stay in bed

tomorrow but after that she'll be

fine. I suggest someone stays

with her.

PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription

from his hand.

PAULA

She'll be safe with me.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 109.

She looks bitterly at Colin.

CUT TO:

COLIN walks CONNELL to his car, their feet crunching on the

gravel.

CONNELL

Well, goodnight then.

COLIN holds the door open as he gets in.

COLIN

Was she really pregnant?

CONNELL

I think that's a private matter

between Mr and Mrs. Miller.

He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the

door and drives off. COLIN stands watching, shivering in

his shirtsleeves.

CUT TO:

COLIN creeps into the room and sits on the bed. MARILYN is

awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid.

MARILYN

We have to say goodbye now,

Colin. Arthur's on his way back.

When this film is over I'm going

to settle down and be a good wife

to him. I'm going to learn to

make Matzo ball soup as good as

his dad's.

She smiles wistfully at the fantasy.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

We have to forget this ever

happened.

COLIN

I don't want to forget.

He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Let me protect you from all

this...

She smiles sadly.

MARILYN

What do you want to do? Marry me?

COLIN

Why not? You could come and live

at my parents place. You'd love

it. It's a castle, like in a

fairy tale. We wouldn't even have

to live together. You could have

your own suite of rooms...

COLIN (CONT'D)

You could quit. Forget Marilyn

Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it

all go.

MARILYN

This is what I've worked for my

whole life. I couldn't just give

it all up.

COLIN

Why not, when it drives you

crazy?

MARILYN

You think I'm crazy?

COLIN

I didn't mean that. I just meant

you could be happy.

MARILYN

I am happy. I got everything I

ever dreamed about.

COLIN

Of course you're happy. (Pause)

You're a star. The biggest star

in the world.

COLIN (CONT'D)

You're right, Marilyn. We have to

forget all this.

(MORE)

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111-

112.

COLIN (CONT'D)

From now on I'm nobody. Just the

third. You don't even know I

exist. We'll never look at each

other again.

She giggles with some of her old playfulness.

MARILYN

Well, maybe just a wink. Once in

a while.

He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out.

As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be

replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.

CUT TO:

DAY.

OLIVIER sits in front of his make-up mirror in his Grand

Ducal uniform, smoothing down his hair with pomade. COLIN

knocks and comes in.

COLIN

They're ready for you on set, Sir

Laurence.

OLIVIER

Marilyn?

COLIN

She's just arrived.

OLIVIER

Only an hour late. Not bad by her

standards.

He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

Maybe we will finish this bloody

film after all.

CUT TO:

The crew are ready. The actors are on set. OLIVIER stands by

the camera. COLIN is half-hidden in the shadows. There is a

flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one

side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn

should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her

platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.

She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.

He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.

112A.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I hope you will all forgive me. It

wasn't altogether my fault. I have

been ill.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

I'd like you to remember I tried.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113.

OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on

top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after

his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible

as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"..I found a dream and lay in your

arms the whole night through, I'm

yours no matter what others may say

or do. Be light of heart and fancy

free, that's the way to start,

there will be nothing to lose till

you lose your heart.."

She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There

is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is

amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy

for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept

up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her

she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring

softly so that only he can hear.

SYBIL THORNDIKE

First love is such sweet despair,

Colin.

She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a

long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into

the darkness at the back of the set.

Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the

finish line. We see a montage of scenes being filmed -

- HARDWICK enters as Major Domo through the main door of the

oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving

equipment...

- WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the

Grand Duke's bedroom...

- WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door...

The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is

done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence -

ORTON

Very quiet, studio! Going for a

take.

The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy

clunks.

DENYS

Camera running! Speed!

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113A.

ORTON

ACTION!

MARILYN looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing.

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"My dear..."

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"I've got a solemn word of warning

for you."

OLIVIER (AS REGENT)

"What's that, my beloved?"

MARILYN (AS ELSIE)

"You know what's going to happen?

I'm going to fall in love with you,

because I always, always do."

CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and

vitality.

And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',

MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He

grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles

indulgently.

ORTON

Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a

wrap!

There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN

leaves the stage.

MARILYN walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone.

The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a

group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a

grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward,

calling out above the hubbub.

MILTON

If you'd all like to step this way,

you'll find something I think

you'll like.

MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,

loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.

MILTON (CONT'D)

A parting gift to each of you from

Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on

the right.

JACOBS

It's been a lot of fun, kids. See

you at the Academy Awards.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 114.

150 OMITTED 150

The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who

cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking

nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.

COLIN

Aren't you going to throw yours

away?

LUCY

Of course not. It's from Marilyn

Monroe.

He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115.

COLIN

(After a second)

Lucy?

She turns back to look at him.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I was wondering if you're doing

anything this Saturday.

LUCY

I'm washing my hair.

He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She

goes but then stops to look back at him.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Did she break your heart?

COLIN

(After a second)

A little.

LUCY

Good. It needed breaking.

There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that

he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the

experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.

LUCY (CONT'D)

(After a second)

I might be free on Wednesday.

COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's

present in his hands.

CUT TO:

COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on

outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees

ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his

job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything

they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly

salute and then goes on his way.

OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the

"The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes

in. OLIVIER glances at him.

OLIVIER

"You do look, my son, in a moved

sort/As if you were dismay'd: be

cheerful, sir./Our revels now are

ended.

(MORE)

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

These our actors,/As I foretold

you, were all spirits and/Are

melted into air, into thin air...

COLIN

Prospero.

OLIVIER

(SMILES)

We are such stuff/As dreams are

made on, and our little life/Is

rounded with a sleep..."

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

(After a second)

She's quite wonderful. No

training, no craft, no guile,

just pure instinct. Astonishing.

COLIN

You should tell her that.

OLIVIER

Oh, I will. But she won't believe

me. That's probably what makes

her great. It's certainly what

makes her so profoundly unhappy.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

I tried my best to change her,

but she remains brilliant despite

me. (Pause) Directing a movie has

to be just about the best job

ever invented, but Marilyn has

cured me of ever wanting to do it

again.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

And now I'm going back to the

theatre. John Osborne is writing

a piece for me.

COLIN

I thought you hated all that

Royal Court stuff.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117.

OLIVIER

(SMILES)

Miller made me see things

differently. (Pause) You have to

find new worlds to conquer, if

you want to be the best. And

believe me, most of the time, I

really am the best.

He goes to the door and pauses.

OLIVIER (CONT'D)

You've done a good job, boy.

(Pause) Welcome to the circus.

He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.

COLIN

Run it again, please.

The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,

laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where

Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene

90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.

HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the

darkness, then -

The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing

his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing

the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head

down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.

BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and

regulars at play.

And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and

freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up

as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.

COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to

his woe and his pint.

MARILYN

Buy a girl a drink?

COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.

COLIN

Can I get another one of those

please, Barry?

BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not

to stare.

MARILYN

I didn't want to leave without

saying goodbye.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A.

MARILYN hands COLIN a package.

MARILYN (CONT'D)

The first time you saw this, all I

had on was the radio.

Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the

first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE

MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

MARILYN (CONT'D)

Don't forget me.

COLIN

As if I could.

MARILYN

Everyone else on the picture wishes

they could.

COLIN

Everyone else doesn't understand.

She smiles, touched.

MARILYN

Be a gentleman and walk me to my

car?

The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens

the car door for MARILYN.

MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles

and says lightly:

COLIN

What's that for?

MARILYN

That's for being on my side; and

remember, when you see me wink,

that's for you.

ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.

ROGER

(glancing at COLIN)

Looking a couple of inches taller

than when I first saw you.

ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well

done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he

watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.

BARRY

Was that really Marilyn Monroe?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.

COLIN

No - just a good friend of mine.

BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring

at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it

drives into the English countryside.

FADE TO:

COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat

dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is

little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and

down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.

We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.

COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all

over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.

A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own

desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.

COLIN

Any messages?

THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.

SECRETARY

It's probably just someone having

a joke.

COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles

phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.

COLIN

(After a moment)

Did she say anything?

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 118.

SECRETARY

She just asked you to call.

(Pause) It is a joke, isn't it?

COLIN stares down at the paper.

COLIN

Probably. (Pause) Book a call as

soon as you can. Los Angeles,

California. Brentwood 1890.

CUT TO:

It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of

paper.

The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.

OPERATOR

Your call to Los Angeles.

We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits

anxiously as the ringing continues.

CUT TO:

155A

ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable

Brentwood house.

CUT TO:

DAY.

The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions

and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood

hills.

A white phone rings on the table.

It rings continuously, insistently.

It carries on ringing.

No one comes.

HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think

Marilyn might appear, but she never does.

It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As

the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet

echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119.

MARILYN

(VO)

"I found a dream and lay in your

arms the whole night through, I'm

yours no matter what others may

say or do. Be light of heart and

fancy free, that's the way to

start, there will be nothing to

lose till you lose your heart..."

The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly

drifts away to nothing.

COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn

singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise

has been revisiting it in his memory.

He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going

to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle

in resignation.

His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He

stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they

have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he

is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.

He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a

Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends

to look.

The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her

most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from

The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by

Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since

forgotten.

We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,

looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.

After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to

where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks

happily.

Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet

and charming.

There is something so completely natural about the gesture

COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and

MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It

moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen

this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for

years.

It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,

affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever

his.

She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without

sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then

looks back, smiling at the camera.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
