Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and

a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus

known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the

Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught

This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much

as realize this. I felt so close to the

paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces

of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in

the first place - what had got me into this -

and I thought - dreamed - remembered-

FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide

carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air.

FLAN (VO)

painting. He can paint and paint - work on a

canvas for months and one day he loses it - just

loses the structure - loses the sense of it -

you lose the painting.
