DR. JAMISON

Okay, this is it!

SAM

(spins in circles)

This is it!  This is it!

DR. JAMISON

There's someone who's been waitin' an

awful long time to see you, Sam.

SMASH CUT TO:

SAM

Didn't you just fall asleep, little

girl?

(Lucy cries harder)

Okay, if you say it's time to get up,

then it's time to get up, time to get

up.

(Sam sniffs the air)

Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of

business.

SAM (CONT'D)

Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me

see let me see let me see.

SAM (CONT'D)

You look very beautiful this morning,

very beautiful.

CUT TO:

RASPY WOMAN (O.S.)

What the hell are you doing to that

baby?!

SAM

Everything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny.

Everything.  Won't you please come over?

Help.  I need somebody.  Won't you

please please help me.

ANNIE

You know I can't do that.  What does her

mother say?

SAM

Her mother?  Her mother said "This isn't

my life.  I'm outta here when she comes.

It didn't mean anything, Sam.  It was

just one night.  The two of you.  That's

all I need..." Annie, what if she's

sick?

ANNIE

She's overheated and not eating enough.

How often are you feeding her?

SAM

A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber.

ANNIE

What's a lot?

SAM

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Three

squares hot.

ANNIE

Babies need food every two hours, Sam.

SAM

Oh.  I'm sorry Lucy Diamond.

ANNIE

What time does the little diamond wake

up?

SAM

She never really goes to sleep.

ANNIE

Okaaaay.  Well, let's assume she's up at

six.  Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.  I

want you to feed her first while

"Bewitched" is on.  Then again, when

"Hogan's Heroes" starts.  After that,

well until "Father Knows Best..."

CUT:

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM

What are you doing here now?!  Her first

sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound.

BRAD

Eight years every Thursday Video Night

and you forgot?!

SAM

Oh my god, Video Night.  First Thursday

of the month.  Video night at Sam's

house.  I'm sorry, I forgot.

IFTY

Becca's gone.  "Gone with the Wind" is a

very sad movie.

ROBERT

Oh here we go...Everything changes now.

Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night

Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I

got hit by a car today.

SAM

You did?

ROBERT

It's probably that guy from the V.A.

BRAD

What guy?

ROBERT

(closing window)

I can't discuss it.  And now this.

SAM

She looks smart, doesn't she?

IFTY

Of course, look.  She's already reading

the newspaper.  I have five smart

sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother.

"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a

wonderful movie I forgot to bring last

week for Video Night...

BRAD

Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight?

ROBERT

Now it's all my fault?!

BRUCE

Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke

a date with a daydream to come here.

BRAD

Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at

nine!  It's only six-thirty!

ESTELLE

(unaware of the baby)

Sorry.  I'll wait in the lobby.

IFTY

She needs motion.  My father drove my

sisters in his taxi to get them to go to

sleep.  Two-fifty surcharge on all

taxi's from the airport...

ROBERT

I got hit by a taxi on Tuesday.

CUT TO:

BUS DRIVER

Main and Temple...again.  She out yet?

SAM

Almost there, almost there.  One more

round and she'll be down for the night.

SAM

Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat.

Good choice, very good choice.

SAM

Please, Annie!  She's too big to take to

work.

ANNIE

I'm not a baby-sitter.  I'm too busy.

LUCY

Annie, Annie, Annie...

ANNIE

(suspicious)

Did you teach her that?

SAM

It was her first word.  Very first word.

ANNIE

And people worry you're not smart.

ANNIE

This is Mozart.  He did twenty-two

variations of "Twinkle Twinkle Little

Star".  You smell good.  You can tell a

lot about a person by their smell.  If

they've got too much perfume on they're

covering something up.  You gotta watch

someone who smells like soap.  Gotta

wonder what their priorities are.

Nervous people.  People who try too

hard.  They smell like fish.  But you.

You smell like milk.  Milk and hope.

VOICE (O.S.)

Groceries, Annie.

ANNIE

Thanks.

ANNIE (CONT'D)

Lucy!  Come back here!  Come back!

ANNIE (CONT'D)

"Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."

LUCY (V.O.)

Daddy, where does the sky end?

SAM (V.O.)

Let me see, let me see.  I've never been

there but they say it's somewhere near

China.

LUCY (V.O.)

Are lady bugs only girls or are there

boys, too.  And if there are, what are

they called?

SAM (V.O.)

The Beatles.

LUCY (V.O.)

Do I look more like you or Mommy?

LUCY

If you and Mommy liked each other enough

to have me, how come you're not together

anymore?

SAM

I think she fell out of love with me.

Not you, never you.  Me, just me.

LUCY

When you fall out of love where do you

land?

SAM

Somewhere in Florida, I think.

LUCY

Do you think she'll ever come back?

SAM

(long pause)

Paul McCartney lost his mother when he

was fourteen.  John lost his mother

twice.  First when Julie gave John to

her sister Mimi to raise.  And then

again when Julia was hit by a car.  They

say God picks certain people, special

people.  That's what they say.

LUCY

Daddy, did God mean for you to be like

this or was it an accident?

SAM

Do you mean - what do you mean?

LUCY

I mean you're different.

SAM

What do you mean?  I mean, what do you

mean?

LUCY

You're not like the other daddies.

SAM

I'm not am I.  I'm sorry.

LUCY

Don't be sorry.  I'm lucky.  Nobody

else's daddy ever comes to the park.

SAM

We are very lucky, aren't we?

GRACE

Ice cream on the side.

LUCY

Not on top.  Not on top.

SAM

Good choice.  Very good choice.

SAM

Brad, I know it was your turn.  I'm sure

of it.

BRAD

I swear to God it was Robert's turn.

ROBERT

Why is it always my fault?

IFTY

I keep track, last time, I say to

myself, I say, write it down... Bank of

America give away beautiful calendar,

every month a picture of wild animal,

look June, an Elk.  Elke Sommer...she

starred in the remake of "Prisoner of

Zenda"... Three stars Leonard Maltin

video movie guide.

LUCY

Annie let me borrow it.

SAM

You need a good sturdy school shoe.

Arches are very important.

IFTY

Sturdy is boring.  Red shoes bring good

luck.

BRAD

But red doesn't got with green.

IFTY

Except on Christmas.

BRAD

No brown clodhoppers.  Everyone will

make fun of her.

SAM

NO ONE will make fun of Lucy.

ROBERT

She might be stupid.

IFTY

No she's not --

ROBERT

Did they test her?

BRAD

You don't know for sure.

SAM

Yes I do.

BRUCE

But if she is, don't make her go to

school.

ROBERT

Don't let her in the lunch room.  Johnny

Marzettie's there.

BRAD

And gym.  Get her a pass.  The rules for

volleyball are so hard to remember.

"Rotate Rackman Rotate."

IFTY

Throw the ball at his forehead and the

water on his brain will come out his

nose.

LUCY

I like these.

SAM

She know what she likes.  She likes

these.  How much are they?

SALESMAN

Forty-nine ninety-nine.

SAM

One penny less than fifty.  These shoes

are one penny less than fifty?

LUCY

It's okay, Dad.  I don't really like

them.

SAM

No, no no no no.

IFTY

We'll all give ten dollars.

BRAD

I've only got three plus five.  But I

need one for stamps.

ROBERT

Don't pull your wad out in front of

people.

SAM

Thank you, thank you.  We are rich in

friends.  That's what our fortune cookie

said.  1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes

one.

SALESMAN

I'll count it.

SAM

Is it enough?

SALESMAN

(exasperated)

If there's a God.

BRAD

Do we get a balloon with these?

SALESMAN

Yes.

ROBERT

All of us, or just her?

SMASH CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM

Beautiful kick!  Very close!

SAM (CONT'D)

Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're

getting scared now!

MR. RHODES

C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're

all counting on you!

SAM

Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang

of it now!  You've got them scared now!

SAM (CONT'D)

L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry!

MR. RHODES

The whole game was right in front of

your nose!  I leave work early to watch

you blow the whole game!?

CONNER (O.S.)

Ha!

CONNER (CONT'D)

What's wrong with your father?  Why's he

acting like a retard?

LUCY

He is.

CONNER

Are you?

LUCY

No.

CONNER

Are you sure?

LUCY

Yeah.

CONNER

How do you know?

LUCY

He told me.

CONNER

But he's a retard.

LUCY

Yeah well it takes one to know one!

SAM

"They perched in sisisi..."

LUCY

"Silence."

SAM

"...silence for a long time."  Boy.

Your teacher chose a hard book this

time.  "How can we be so difdifdif..."

LUCY

"Different."

LUCY (CONT'D)

I don't like that book - let's read

"Green Eggs and Ham".

SAM

"I am Sam, Sam I am.  Do you like green

eggs and ham?  I do not like them, Sam I

am!"

MATCH DISSOLVE:

SAM (CONT'D)

"And I will eat them here and there.

Say I will eat them ANYWHERE.  I do so

like green eggs and ham, thank you thank

you, Sam I am!"  One more time!

LUCY

Daddy, I have school tomorrow...I don't

wanna be too sleepy.

SAM

Just the part about the boat and the

goat in the rain in the train?

LUCY

Daddy, Hamburger Hamlet has twelve

different kinds of hamburgers.  Can we

go there Wednesday instead of Denny's?

SAM

But Wednesday night's Denny's,

Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night

Karaoke.

SAM (CONT'D)

How about one more time, just the

beginning?  "I am Sam, Sam I am..."

MISS WRIGHT

Lucy, your turn.  Start where Sara left

off...Lucy?

LUCY

I can't.

MISS WRIGHT

Sure you can.

LUCY

"They perched in sisisisi..."

MISS WRIGHT

Silence.

LUCY

(throws down book)

There.  I told you.  It's too hard.

MISS WRIGHT

Lucy!  I know you can read this!

LUCY

No, I can't!  And you can't make me!

LILY

Look here.  "Premature baby claims he's

cupid - has the arrow to prove it."  Do

you believe that?

SAM

Well, if he has the arrow.

LILY

Yeah.  You got a good point.

SAM

You're a good reader.

LILY

Yeah, I've always been smart.

SAM

You're lucky.  I'm looking for a smart,

good mother.

LILY

I can be a mother.  A real good mother.

SAM

Oh, good.  Good.

LILY

I could even spank you.

SAM

Oh no no no.  I don't believe in that.

LILY

Okay okay.  I can be very gentle.

SAM

Gentle.  Gentle.  Yes.  Do you tell

stories?

LILY

I got stories up the wazoo.  Why don't

you come with me.  I'll tell you a nice

story.

SAM

I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first.

LILY

A menage a toi?

SAM

French, French the language of France.

You could teach my daughter, Lucy.

LILY

Your daughter?!  Can't you pick her up

after?!

SAM

After?!  No no, Lucy comes too.

LILY

Whatever.

COP

Not so fast.  You're under arrest.

Solicitation.

LILY

He wanted to bring his kid, I said no.

SMASH CUT TO:

COP

It's the first time in nineteen years I

actually believe the guy when he says he

didn't know she was a hooker --

MARGARET BROWN

You say that like it's a good thing.

SAM

...Your teeth don't sound like they were

brushed.  Do it with me now.

COP

Let him go.  He says he's never spent a

night away from his kid... Come with me -

I got a guy who beat the shit out of his

two year old.  Again.

MARGARET BROWN

Yes.  I am seeing you tomorrow, Mr.

Rabins.  She's still screaming?  No,

McDonald's won't help...she's four

months old.

SAM

Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on

the gum line, 1, 2, 3.

MISS WRIGHT

It gives us a great deal of insight into

what she must be feeling.  And in the

classroom, it's becoming clear she's

holding herself back.  It's as if she's

literally afraid to learn.

MISS WRIGHT (CONT'D)

No one doubts that you love your

daughter, Mr. Dawson.  But the

Department of Social Services contacted

us.  They shared with us that your

records show that your intellectual

capacity is around that of a seven year

old.  Our concern is what happens when

Lucy turns eight?

PRINCIPAL

Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss

Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy?

SAM

No one wanted The Beatles to break up.

But you can hear it on the White Album.

They were going in different directions.

LUCY

How can we be so dif..dif...I don't know

that word.

SAM

Yes you do.  It starts with a "d" --

LUCY

I'm tired.

SAM

I don't believe you.

LUCY

Are you calling me a liar?

SAM

Yes.  Now read the word.

LUCY

(crying)

No...I'm stupid.

SAM

No you're not.

LUCY

I don't want to read it if you can't.

SAM

It makes me happy.  I'm happy hearing

you read it.

LUCY

"Why are we different and so much

alike?"

KID

I'm a Super Freak!

CONNER

And I thought my dad was a dork.

LUCY

They have eleven different kinds of

hamburgers.  This is so great.

SAM

A new place.  Your choice.  I said we'd

go to a new place.  And here we are.

LUCY

You know what else I want for my

birthday, Daddy?  I want a hundred

birds.

SAM

The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's.

They make better birds.  There's not so

much stuff on the tables there either.

Why do they have two kinds of mustard on

every table?

WAITRESS

Coffee?

SAM

No, no coffee.  Sam's system can't

handle coffee.

WAITRESS

Okaaay!  What can I get you folks?

LUCY

I'd like the Benito Bandito burger and a

chocolate chip milkshake, please.

SAM

I'll have the fish special, side of

potatoes, salad with Thousand Island

Dressing, cherry pie, and...

WAITRESS

I'm sorry, sir.  We don't have a fish

special.  There's fish and chips.  It

comes with a dinner salad.

SAM

Chips, chips?  You mean potato chips?  I

don't want potato chips.  I want a side

of potatoes.

WAITRESS

You want french fries?

SAM

No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's.

A side of potatoes.

LUCY

They're little red potatoes.

WAITRESS

We don't have new potatoes...

SAM

Denny's has new potatoes.  Six new

potatoes parsley garnish parsley

garnish...

SMASH CUT TO:

SAM

Fish and chips fish and chips.  I will

not eat fish and chips.

LUCY

(exploding)

I will not eat them here or there!  I

will not eat them anywhere!  I will not

eat green eggs and ham!  I will not eat

them, Sam I am!

SAM

Now when they come through the door,

everybody yell "Surprise!"  Do you want

to rehearse again?

CONNER

No.  I bet she already knows.

ROBERT

I didn't tell her.  Did Brad say I did?

SAM

Is that Lucy?  Annie's supposed to call

and warn us.  Shhhh, everyone.

MARGARET BROWN

I don't know if you remember me.  I'm

Margaret Brown from Children's Social

Services.  We met at the police station.

SAM

Put your present over there - Hurry up!

Lucy might be on her way.

(the phone rings)

Hello?  Annie says she's coming up the

stairs.  Everyone be quiet.  Assume

surprise positions!

(Conner keeps talking)

Be quiet!  Assume surprise positions!

CONNER

Oh brother!

SAM

Why are you such a party pooper?!

Assume surprise positions!

CONNER

Make me!

MR. RHODES

Hey!

SAM

He's gonna ruin the surprise!  He's

gonna ruin the surprise!

CONNER

He touched me!  I've got cooties!  I've

got cooties!

MR. RHODES

Get your hands off my boy!

SAM

Surprise!  Happy Birthday!

LUCY

Daddy?!

CONNER

You don't have to call him "Daddy".

(in Sam's face)

She says you're not her real father,

anyway.  She's adopted!

SAM

I'll go get her.

MARGARET BROWN

It would be better if you stay here.

I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's

clear how much you love your daughter,

but we're going to have to remove Lucy

from your home.

SAM

No, no no no.  It's her birthday!  It's

her birthday!

MARGARET BROWN

I know how hard this must be...

(cell phone rings)

...Hello, Betsy.  I'm scheduled to come

to your apartment at four.  No, not five

every two hours.  It's two every five

hours.  She only weighs thirty pounds

for chrissakes...

(back to Sam)

The city has given me the difficult task

of deciding when to intervene on behalf

of the child.  Unfortunately, I've

learned the hard way that it's better

too soon than too late.  For now the

court will decide what's in Lucy's best

interest.

SAM

Run, Lucy, run!

JUDGE (O.S.)

Given the fact that the father was

arrested for solicitation, did not

cooperate with the police...

JUDGE

...could not control his emotions,

endangering other children.  Miss Brown

also cites Mr. Dawson's mental

deficiencies which raise serious

questions about his ability to properly

parent.  I agree to grant petition.

The child shall be removed from the home

until a forma jurisdictional hearing.

Mr. Dawson, is there anything you'd like

to add?

SAM

Yes.  I just wanted it to be a nice

surprise party.  I had gotten the plates

at Pic-N-Save.  Pink and yellow, pink

and yellow.  Like a princess.  And the

balloons at --

JUDGE

(gently)

Mr. Dawson, it sounds like a lovely

party, but right now I want to talk to

you about your legal rights.  I would

strongly suggest you get yourself legal

counsel and allow your attorney to

present your case at the jurisdictional

hearing on February 13th.  Counsel, are

you available?

COUNSEL

Ted, I have a trial that day.

JUDGE

February 20th.  8:00 a.m.

SAM

(panicking)

Twenty-two days?  Lucy will come home

and you want me to bring Lucy back in

twenty-two days?

JUDGE

No, Mr. Dawson.  You'll have supervised

visits twice a week for two hours.  Now

I'm sorry, we have thirty more cases to

see today.  Next!  Hopkins vs. Clifford.

SAM

Thursday?  Today is Monday, Mrs.  Brown.

That's three days away.  That's too

long.  She can't sleep without Mr.

Jeeters.  Well if you're not available

until Thursday, maybe I could see her

without you there...

maybe the Judge made a mistake - maybe

he doesn't know that for seven years I

played with her without you there...No

Mrs. Brown, I'm not trying to violate

the court...

(the other line hangs up)

Mrs. Brown?

ROBERT

I bet they were recording the whole

conversation.  Check your phone.  You

can't make a move.  You need a lawyer.

BRAD

Call Jerry Spence.  He has his own show.

He must know what he's doing.

ROBERT

No.  Johnny Cochran.  He has his own

show, too.

BRAD

Yeah!  He can even get a guilty person

off.

SAM

So you think I'm guilty?

IFTY

No.  You didn't kill anybody.

SAM

But she said I'm not her father.

IFTY

She didn't say that.  That runty kid

with the blue shirt and the mean father

whose voice sounds like the man on the

Channel Four News who has a toupee.

Toupees are expensive.

SAM

But Ifty.  She said it.

IFTY

But she didn't mean it.  I said I hated

my mother once.  "Once upon a time..."

is how stories begin.

ROBERT

You should get a personal injury lawyer.

You've been personally injured.

BRAD

Here - look at this - "Sebastion

Gibson."  He can do anything.

Pedestrians.  Back and neck.  Uninsured

Motorist.  Dog attacks.

SAM

The Social Worker said it's a custody

case.

ROBERT

Then get a divorce lawyer.

IFTY

When Dustin Hoffman was trying to keep

Billy from going back to Meryl Streep,

his lawyer said it was going to cost him

fifteen thousand dollars - and that's if

we win!

SAM

Fifteen thousand dollars!

BRAD

Don't worry about money now.  Get the

best.  Century City - Here: "Rubel Bly

Harrison and Williams".

RITA

Did Fred Kimble call?  I'm already

twenty minutes late.

PATRICIA

He --

RITA

What'd Michelle Kresge say?

PATRICIA

She --

RITA

She wasn't defensive, was she?

PATRICIA

Well --

RITA

That's ridiculous.  What happened with

my car?

PATRICIA

They --

RITA

Because it wasn't my fault.

PATRICIA

I --

RITA

Thank you, Patricia.

PATRICIA

This is Mr. Dawson.  There was some

confusion with the temp last week and --

RITA

Mr. Dawson, it's a pleasure.  Since

somebody made a mistake, unfortunately

we only have a little time.  Hold all my

calls unless it's my kid - I'll have a

double cap.

SAM

Good choice, very good choice.

RITA

Can we get you anything to drink?

SAM

Is it free?

SAM (CONT'D)

...Lucy had an ice-cream cake with pink

flowers - pink, not white not

white...Lucy's favorite is cherry

vanilla which is pink, too.  Cherries

and vanilla.

RITA

Uh huh uh huh -- uh huh uh

(into Amtel)

If that's Jake Hiller, put him through.

(picking up phone)

Jake.  No no no no no no.

PATRICIA

(from speaker)

Your son's on line two.

RITA

Jake, did you get that?!

(to Patricia)

Tell him to hold for just one second.

Jake I have to go...he what?

PATRICIA

(through speaker)

Deborah Chapman on line three --

RITA

Hold on Jake.

(she punches another line)

No no no no no no no.  Have a nice

weekend.

(punches another button)

Jake?!

SAM

Burt Bacharach shared billing with The

Beatles and Jose Jiminez on the Ed

Sullivan Show June 5th, 1968.

RITA

Really?

(then)

Jake, what'd you say you tell him yes I

am.

(yelling; re: coffee)

This tastes like low, are you sure it's

non?  Okay okay okay.  I think there's

been a little mistake here --

SAM

Yes.  A little one.  Your son's on line

two.

RITA

Oh my God.

(pushes another line)

Danny?

(Danny's hung up)

Patricia?  Get Danny back.  Well keep

trying.

RITA (CONT'D)

Mr. Dawson, what I'm trying to say is

I'm a divorce lawyer and as much as I'd

like to, I don't handle cases like yours

--

SAM

Since you would like to, why don't you

talk to your boss.  Maybe he would let

you.

RITA

(into phone)

Then keep dialing --

(to Sam)

What I mean is that at this point in my

career, I can't afford to.

SAM

I earn eight dollars an hour at

Starbucks.  I can pay your hourly rate,

rate by the hour, hourly --

RITA

Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry, I have to be in

court in eight minutes with the Kresges.

You understand, good luck to you and

don't give up.

RITA (CONT'D)

Patricia?!  Where are my keys?  Where

the hell are my keys?!  Alright alright.

(replaying)

I walked into the room - I went over

here - I looked at my desk - I put my

coat down - Patricia?!  Where's my coat?

SAM (O.S.)

Is there a child involved in Mr.

Kresges' case?

RITA

No.

SAM

This is Lucy.  One year old.  First

word, "apple".  December third.  3:16

p.m.  December third.

SAM (CONT'D)

Here's Lucy two years old.  First merry

go-round ride.  June 6th.  4:13 p.m.

June 6th.  Here's Lucy.  Seven years

old.  The day the police took her away.

SAM (CONT'D)

Thank you for telling me not to give up.

I won't give up.

PATRICIA

(through the phone)

Danny on Line 2.

RITA

Danny?  Hi.  Could we possibly talk

about this when I get home.  Danny?

Danny?  C'mon.  You're not gonna talk to

me?  I bought you a bag of your favorite

lemonade jelly beans.  Danny?

(Rita starts singing)

"One little bird in one little tree,

we're all alone and we don't want to

be... So they flew far away over the

trees..." I said "Over the sea..." I

know the words, I said "Over the sea..."

Since when don't you like that song?

Danny?

RITA (CONT'D)

Danny?

RITA (CONT'D)

Danny?

RITA (CONT'D)

I hate this stupid coffee table - how

many times have I asked you to get rid

of this crappy coffee table?

SAM

(from the doorway)

You did say "over the trees" instead of

"over the sea."  It's hard to remember

all the words to all the songs.  There's

so many.

(Rita almost stops)

you have a child Rita rubel Bly Harrison

Williams.  If they took him away

wouldn't you hire the fastest talking

four-named lawyer you could?

RITA

Yes, I would.  I went to college with a

friend who does these kinds of cases.

Leave your number.  I'll see if she can

help you.

PATRICIA

(through your phone)

Your therapist on Line 1.

RITA

Tell him you can't find me.

SAM

I'm ready.

GEORGE

Let's not add more stress to your life.

SAM

I'm ready.  I'm ready to make coffee.

Lo-fat decaf latte.  Coffee up to here.

Add steamed milk up to here.  No foam,

no foam.  Cinnamon or chocolate

sprinkles.

GEORGE

That's pretty good Sam.  I'll think

about it.

SAM

I know what that means.  I stock shelves

at Lucky Supermarkets.  I want to bag

groceries, Miss Losey says "I'll think

about it."  Randy Brenner gets the job.

I was the janitor at the La Reina

Theater, I wanted to take tickets.  Mr.

Jenkins said he'd think about it.  Larry

Peters gets the job.  Lets his friends

in for free...

GEORGE

I promise you, Sam.  I'll honestly think

about it.  You have my word.

SAM

Words, words, words.  I need more than

that.  I need to pay my lawyer.  I need

to make coffee.

RITA

I am celebrating congratulations to us

these are the moments good night.

SAM

Non-fat vente cap.  I'm sorry to bother

you, but did you call your friend?

(Rita's confused)

Your friend from college, your friend

who does this kind of work?

RITA

(there never was a friend)

I don't have her number anymore, Sam.

We lost touch.

SAM

(devastated)

Oh, that happens.  That happens.  People

lose touch.  Will you call me if you

find it?  If you get back in touch?

RITA

Yes, I'm just in the middle..it's a

special..I'll call you.

COLLEAGUE

Is that the new janitor?

RITA

No, it's a case.  Sort of a pro-bono

thing.

RITA (CONT'D)

What's that supposed to mean?

PATRICIA

Nothing.  A cracker went down the wrong

pipe.

RITA

You think I don't pro-bono?..I can do

pro-bono.. I can do Goddamn pro-bono..

where the hell are my keys..hold the

door!

SAM

32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st

floor.  31 floors more...

RITA

Alright, alright I'll take you.

Alright, Goddammitt, I'll take you.

SAM

Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison

and Williams!

RITA

No, no  no.  Pro-bono.  Alright?  Pro

bono.

SAM (O.S.)

Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too!

MARGARET BROWN

Lucy, I'm sorry.  But it doesn't look

like he's going to make it.

LUCY

(staring forward)

He'll be here.  You smell like soap.

MARGARET BROWN

Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late.

You'll only have a few minutes left.

LUCY

Daddy!  I told you I told you!

CUT TO:

SAM

...and she's a Century City lawyer - a

very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name

is?  Rita Harrison.

LUCY

(jaw drops)

Lovely Rita Meter Maid.

SAM

Harrison.  Just like George.

SAM (CONT'D)

You've grown.

LUCY

Have I?

SAM

Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are

older.

SAM (CONT'D)

I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next

paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can

leave a message.  "Hi, This is Lucy."

LUCY

You can't afford a phone machine.

SAM

Yes we can.  I'm in line for a

promotion.  Big promotion.  A promotion

that's big.

LUCY

They're gonna let you make coffee?!

SAM

Set your dreams high, Lucy.

LUCY

I'm sorry, Daddy.  It was all my fault.

SAM

No, Lucy.  Don't say that.

LUCY

I wouldn't want any Daddy but you.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I said I was sorry!  I said I didn't

want any Daddy but him!  Why don't you

write that down?!

RITA

...are you telling me that neither of

you want custody of your child?

WOMAN

He's created a monster.  He's exactly

like him.  He...he...

RITA

I am right here with you, excuse me.

(she unlocks door)

Sam?  Didn't I tell you that you have to

call?

SAM

I -

RITA

You know how to make an appointment.

SAM

It's -

RITA

That's ridiculous you can always get

Patricia.

SAM

They -

RITA

Good.  I'll see you next week.

SAM

But it's an emergency - lots of three

syllable words urgent open at once.

RITA

They want to have you and Lucy evaluated

by a shrink.  The appointment is today

at three.  Today.  Now.  Today!

SAM

I know and I want you to object.

RITA

Sam I can't object.  It's court ordered.

SAM

Here.  Don't be sad.

RITA

Patricia, I'm in the middle - get him

out of there -

RITA (CONT'D)

Sam.  Sam come with me.

(to the Couple)

We're gonna get through this excuse

us...

(to Sam)

Sam this is their turn now.  Not yours.

Theirs.  If you leave now you'll never

make it and you have to make it.

SAM

Okay okay I know I take the #34 bus and

transfer to the #13...than the Downtown

Express to Wilshire then -

RITA

Go! Go! GO! for chrissakes!  Green means

GO!

SAM

Red means stop yellow in the middle

means no no no...I don't like shrinks.

I've seen too many shrinks.

RITA

Yeah.  You and me both.  Right or left

which will it be you IDIOT!?

SAM

Your mother sent you to shrinks, too?

RITA

No.  Well, sort of.  I talk about her

the whole time I'm there.

SAM

That's nice.  Did you notice that

everyone else is driving slower.  I

noticed that did you?

RITA

(on the horn)

Go for Chrissakes!  How about your

mother?  Maybe she can help you -

SAM

She's gone.  She's at the Park Lane

Mortuary.  Two from the left.  Under the

big tree.

RITA

Oh.  I'm sorry.  The light is green!

WOULD YOU MOVE MOVE MOVE!?

SAM

Too many shrinks...I'm sorry Mrs.

Dawson, if I were you I wouldn't waste

any more time.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it

must be a tremendous disappointment.

I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you'd both

be happier if Sam was in a home.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Mr. Dawson, you do understand, that

since I am a court appointed

psychologist, the traditional client

therapist confidentiality will be

waived.

(Sam looks confused)

Mr. Dawson, do you understand that the

confidentiality will be waived?

IFTY

Before you read your message press the

red button for record, when you finish,

press the yellow button.  If you press

the green button, it will play it back

you.  Let's start with the "ogm".

SAM

Okay, okay.  I'm ready.  Hello, I am

Sam.

IFTY

No, no.  I didn't press the red button.

SAM

Oh, yes.  False start, false start.

IFTY

It's not working.  That's what you get

for buying a used machine.  Used means

broken.  You're asking for other

people's problems, you have enough of

your own, not that everyone doesn't have

problems.

BRAD

It's not used.  It's pre-owned.  Guy

bought it for his auto shop and then he

got a secretary.

IFTY

Testing, one two three.

SAM

That's a good code.  I'll remember that.

One, two, three.

IFTY

(pressing button)

Quick, you're recording.

SAM

I'm hi.  I am Sam.  I'm not home.

ROBERT

No, you don't want to say that.  you

don't want them to know you're not home.

SAM

But then I'm lying.

ROBERT

Everybody's lying.

SAM

I'm not a liar.  It will send a mixed

message to Lucy.

IFTY

(pressing the button)

You're on the air!

SAM

Let me see, let me see, let me see.  Hi,

how are you?

IFTY

That was pretty good.  That was natural.

SAM

Did I sound like a good father?

IFTY

It's the outgoing message.  You need to

sound more outgoing.  Let's start again.

ANSWERING MACHINE

Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop.  We'd

love to show you our body work, but it's

invisible.  Leave it at the beep.

LUCY

Try again.  You must have dialed the

wrong number.

RITA

Look, we've got a lot to go over and

I've got five minutes.

SAM

(pointing to elevator)

Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams thirty

second floor, thirty-two floors up.

RITA

One-twenty.  Gotta get to one-twenty

five to make it count.  Okay okay okay.

I'm gonna need that list of people who

can testify that you're a good father

despite your handicap.  I didn't mean

your handicap I meant your disability -

I mean the fact that you're retarded.

That's not the right word.  I mean...

What do I call you?

SAM

Sam.  I am Sam.

RITA

Yes you are.

(he hands her a list - her CELL

PHONE RINGS)

Hello Ted how you doing/  Whattaya mean

what's that supposed to mean?

(her heart beep rate goes up)

Put Danny on... You're supposed to be

taking him to karate.  No it is not my

day it's your day.  I took your day last

Wednesday - are you eating no I will not

hold.  Go pick him up!  What?  I can't

hear you I'm in the car - they put you

through to me here...I'm losing you --

(clicks off phone)

I get paid for this memory - I know I

took him last.

RITA (CONT'D)

We're making progress.  Three character

witnesses.  That's a good start.  What

does Ifty Bhutto do?

SAM

He works in a bank.

RITA

(tripping down the stairs)

Excellent.

IFTY

Sam is a very concerned father.  He

always saves his money at Bank of

America.  Last year there was a lion on

the calendar.  This year a gazelle.  The

gazelle is national bird of Tunisia.  We

have clients, not customers.  At Bank of

America.  Bank on us.

IFTY (CONT'D)

What was the question again, please?

CUT TO:

BRAD

He always made a point of feeding her

breakfast when "Bewitched" was on and

lunch when "Jeopardy" was on so she'd be

smart.  Is that Wonderbra you're

wearing?  Because you look wonderful.

CUT TO:

RITA

How long have you and Sam -

ROBERT

Why are you recording this?  Who's

listening?

RITA

It's often necessary -

ROBERT

Who are you really?

RITA

I'm -

ROBERT

What's that supposed to mean?

RITA

Let's -

ROBERT

I need to talk to my lawyer.

CUT TO:

RITA

Patricia, get Mr. Dawson on the line.

ANSWERING MACHINE (O.S.)

Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop -

RITA

I need this like a - call him at

Starbucks - no I don't know which

Starbucks.  There's forty two between

here and the end of the block.

RITA

Look I don't think you understand what

you're up against we have to be in court

in three days and we don't have a decent

witness.  Now you've gotta know someone

who can testify who's been to college -

or has a degree of some kind - or some

sort of way of expressing themselves

that's gonna make the court believe that

you deserve to get your daughter back I

need a coffee.  Big.  Tall.

SAM

Tall's the smallest.

RITA

Of course.  Of course, whatever.  Okay

okay okay.  Damn!  I forgot to call back

no I did and once you think of this

person and there has to be one person -

I want you to call me at work - because

I'm going back there now to my seven

other cases --

(her cellphone RINGS)

What?  Mrs. Robeck?  I'm on my way, the

traffic's horrible on the 405.  Dorothy,

we put in five months lets not let a

three car pile up..I know it's been

enormously stressful.. Your Esczema?

Oh, honey, nobody notices..AH!  They

opened a lane!

SAM

(too loudly)

Do you want it here or to go?

RITA

(dial tone)

Dorothy?  Dorothy?  No no no I didn't

stare at the eczema for five months for -

RITA (CONT'D)

Sonuvabitch!

SAM

Annie, it's one day.  One hour.  Maybe

only 53 minutes.  Lucy needs you.

(Annie keeps playing)

You went to college.  You can give the

right answers.

SAM (CONT'D)

We can't lose her.

ANNIE

I can't.  I'd make it worse for you.  I

can't do it.  Don't you think I would if

I could?

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip

McNeily.

THERAPIST

...there is an unhealthy reversal of

roles here.

As you can see from her drawings, she

has an exaggerated sense of

responsibility.  Lucy feels she has to

take care of her father.  Although at

her birthday party her true feelings

about her father were revealed.

RITA

Objection.  "True feelings revealed"?!

TURNER

The state is paying Miss Geller for her

opinions -

RITA

Then every child who rages because they

didn't get to stay up for that extra

hour of TV -

TURNER

Objection your honor -

RITA

...in fact any child who said they hated

their parents because they didn't want

to take a bath would be a prime

candidate for Foster Care.

TURNER

Objection.

SAM

I think they want you to stop.

RITA

Really?!  Thank you, Sam.

JUDGE MCNEILY

We all appreciate your assistance Mr.

Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr.

Turner.

TURNER

Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy

session, Mr. Dawson extolled his

parenting abilities.

THERAPIST

On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he

felt profoundly inadequate - that he was

terrified he'd made and would continue

to make - and I quote: "Huge mistakes,

huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge."

TURNER

No further questions.

RITA

You're a mother, aren't you Ms. Geller?

THERAPIST

Yes.

RITA

Would it be fair to say that as a

parent, you've felt confused from time

to time, possibly overwhelmed on

occasion, even though you're a wonderful

mother?

TURNER

Objection.  It's Mr. Dawson's parenting.

Not Ms. Geller's that's at question

here.

RITA

But if Ms. Geller has never had a moment

where she felt confused as a mother it

would bias her opinion.  And it is her

expert opinion we're all after, isn't

it, Mr. Turner?

JUDGE MCNEILY

Overruled.  I'll allow it.

RITA

Thank you, your Honor.  Ms. Geller, I

know there have been many moments as a

parent where I've felt I've made huge

mistakes - mistakes that are huge.  And

I've had to admit them to myself.  My

husband.  But most importantly, to my

therapist.  Which is the guise Mr.

Dawson thought he was seeing you under,

isn't that right, Ms. Geller?

TURNER

Objection.

JUDGE MCNEILY

Get to the point, Ms. Harrison.

RITA

The point is you've never had those

moments, have you Ms. Geller?  Moments

that every parent I've ever spoken to

has - moments when you've felt the task

is so unbelievably challenging that you

feel retarded, disabled in some way.

Moments when you feel everyone has the

key but you.  But you've never had those

moments, have you Ms. Geller?

THERAPIST

I -

RITA

Yes or no?

THERAPIST

I -

RITA

Let me rephrase the question.  When your

son od'ed -

TURNER

Objection!

RITA

But if Ms. Geller didn't feel she had

made mistakes - mistakes that were huge

it might bias her opinion toward Mr.

Dawson.

JUDGE MCNEILY

I will -

RITA

Thank you.  So Ms. Geller - yes or no -

when your son od'ed, did you feel you

might have made mistakes, mistakes that

were huge?

THERAPIST

(tearfully)

Yes.

SAM

You made her cry.

RITA

You got lucky.

SAM

That's not nice.  Not very nice.

RITA

Only in there.

SAM

Your secretary too.  Yellow and green in

one bowl.

(Sam stares at a bowl of Lima

beans and corn)

You separate the Lima beans from the

corn please?

RITA

Sam, don't be impossible.

(then to Worker)

Can I have the spinach omelet - only egg

whites no fat no oil no butter and extra

mushrooms.

CAFETERIA WORKER

Absolutely.

SAM

My treat.  My treat.

RITA

Don't be ridiculous.  I'll get it.

SAM

I said it's my treat.  That means I'll

get it.

RITA

Sam, do you really want to get it or are

you just trying to --

SAM

Trying to what?

RITA

You know, trying to act like a -

SAM

Like a what?

RITA

Like a...a...

SAM

A real man?

RITA

I didn't say that.

SAM

You're my lawyer and you think what they

think.  I don't have a chance.  No

chance at all.  Even with an expert

witness.

RITA

I think...you deserve...a fair trial.

SAM

Answer the question.

RITA

Okay okay okay.  What was the question

again?

SAM

Do you think what they think?  Sam can't

order food.  Sam can't pay a check.  Sam

can't take care of Lucy?

RITA

It doesn't matter what I think - it

matters that we win.

SAM

You're my lawyer it matters what you

think.

RITA

Hey, it doesn't matter to them what I

think.

SAM

Me.  It matters to me.

SAM (CONT'D)

Fourteen thirty three.  That's 5 ones, 2

quarters and 16 cents less than twenty.

RITA

Dr. Donovan, the American Medical

Journal named you one of the country's

leading oncologists.  Isn't that

correct?

DR. DONOVAN

Yes.

RITA

What kept you going the twelve years you

were in medical school?

DR. DONOVAN

Caffeine.  Sugar.  And my mother's

confidence in me.

RITA

I wish I had a mother like that.  She

must have been smart.

DR. DONOVAN

She had great instincts.

RITA

Do you have any idea what her IQ was?

DR. DONOVAN

In the lower ranges.  About eighty.

RITA

So your mother, this woman with the IQ

of a nine-year old had the wisdom to

recognize that you would be a great

doctor.  I guess her disability didn't

seem to hold you back in life.

DR. DONOVAN

No.  My mother's condition taught me

what they can't teach you; compassion

and patience.

RITA

Traits most doctors have in spades.

Thank you, no further questions.

TURNER

How'd you get through medical school?

Where'd you live?

DR. DONOVAN

We lived with my mother's parents.

TURNER

Oh, Grandma and Grandpa.  Would it be

fair to say your grandparents were of

normal intelligence?

DR. DONOVAN

Yes.

TURNER

And didn't these people - your

grandparents - with normal intelligence -

have the real responsibilities?

RITA

(relishing this)

Objection!  I hear Mr. Turner's mother

in-law lives with him!  She must help

out.  Does that mean he doesn't have the

real -

TURNER

Motion to strike that from the record.

Irrelevant, immaterial and immature -

RITA

Irrelevant?!  Any parent has a right to

a support system.

TURNER

I'm not talking about the rights of the

parent, I'm talking about the rights of

a child.

(the gavel bangs)

I'm talking about entrusting an eight

year old's welfare in the hands of

someone whose records show he was

diagnosed with infantile autism, mental

retardation...

RITA

Objection!  Motion to strike that from

the record.  It's clear that one's

intellectual capacity has no bearing on

their ability to love.  You Honor, would

you please instruct council to proceed

with a modicum of sensitivity?

TURNER

Oh, I'm sensitive.  I'm real sensitive

when I see people like you --

(the gavel BANGS!)

come here and try to give meaning to

your life by screwing up somebody

else's!

JUDGE MCNEILY

That's enough.  Both lawyers approach

the bench!

RITA

(both approach)

And I suppose tearing apart a family is

truly noble work, Mr. Turner.

JUDGE MCNEILY

That's it.  I fine you both for

contempt.  Two-hundred fifty dollars.

TURNER

What's that to her?  She gets that for

picking up the phone.

RITA

Oh, that's what this is about.

TURNER

I'll tell you what this is about.  See

this is an award for you at some

luncheon.  But I'm here everyday.

(gavel POUNDS AGAIN)

You win, you're out the door.

But guess who I see come back?  The kid.

Most of the time, in less than a year.

Only now it's too late.  So you're

right.  I'm real sensitive.  You can't

even touch that area.

CUT TO:

LUCY

But how did he prove it?

SAM

Columbus had to sail around the world to

prove it was round.

LUCY

You're so smart, Daddy.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Are we winning, Daddy?

MARGARET BROWN

Excuse me, time's up.

LUCY

Please.  Just a little more.

MARGARET BROWN

I have another client at two-thirty.

You need to put your shoes on and get

ready to go.

LUCY

Oh no!  There's a knot.  A really big

knot.

MARGARET BROWN

I'll help you.

LUCY

I need to go to the bathroom.

LUCY

Daddy, she said we could go to the park.

SAM

What's going on?  What made her change

her mind?

LUCY

I started crying in the bathroom.  She

thought we needed more time.

SAM

That was so nice of her.  Very nice.

LUCY

Let's not get off.  Let's keep going.

SAM

No, Lucy.

LUCY

Please.

SAM

That would be wrong.

LUCY

Tamara's Mommy lost her case and Tamara

hasn't seen her in six years.  She's had

five different mommies and one of them

hit her.

SAM

I won't let that happen.

LUCY

That's what her real mommy said.  And

now they won't even let her talk to her.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Daddy, it's the only way to be together.

We'll start a new life, get new names.

We'll live in a new apartment.  They'll

never find us.

SAM

I love you Lucy.  I love you.

LUCY

My name isn't Lucy anymore, it's

Michelle.

COP

Hey, buddy.  No loitering.  Move it.

SAM

Not yet not yet not yet.

COP

You want me to get a black and white

down here?

SAM

Not yet not yet not yet.

COP

Jesus Christ.

SAM

She hasn't been sleeping well.  She

needs a good night's rest.  Let her

sleep, let her sleep.

(the cop moves toward Sam)

NO!

COP

What are you, crazy?

SMASH CUT TO:

RITA

What were you thinking what were you

possibly thinking?!

SAM

I -

RITA

That's ridiculous!  Danny stay with me -

(he moves away)

What could you possibly gain by

kidnapping your kid in the middle of a

custody hearing?!

SAM

She -

RITA

I don't wanna hear it!  Can you possibly

explain this to me?!

SAM

But Lucy said -

RITA

Who's the parent here?  Who's the

goddamned parent here?  Danny!  Stay in

the hallway -

RITA (CONT'D)

Miss Brown, I can imagine what you're

thinking.

MARGARET BROWN

I'm -

RITA

But I ask you what parent in their right

mind seeing their child in pain --

MARGARET BROWN

I have seen -

RITA

Their yearning for contact - wouldn't

take them in an attempt to comfort them?

Where the hell is Danny?

MARGARET BROWN

You -

RITA

He -

MARGARET BROWN

There's -

RITA

Oh yes there is!  And if I were you I'd

look at my conscience you do have one

don't you long and hard before I tried

to use this in court.

MARGARET BROWN

Is that a threat?

RITA

No.  It's a plea.  Give'm a break.

Give'm one goddman break.

MARGARET BROWN

What?!  No, Mrs. Sloan.  His temperature

couldn't be 117, no not even 107.  Okay,

okay, I'll come...Come on Lucy, I'll

take you back.

RITA

C'mon, Danny.  We're going home.

Danny!?  Danny!?!?

RITA (CONT'D)

Goddamn it, Danny!

LUCY

Please don't fire us.  It was all my

idea.  Please don't.  Please.  Please.

BAILIFF

...the whole truth, and nothing but the

truth, so help you God?

LUCY

So help me God...

TURNER

I heard you turned seven this year.

That's pretty exciting.

LUCY

Everybody gets older.  It's not that big

a deal.

TURNER

What'd you get for your birthday?

LUCY

I haven't opened my presents yet.

TURNER

Really?  That's odd.  Why not?

LUCY

I opened my presents.  I got the HELP

album - limited edition.

TURNER

Oh, I'm sorry.  I was confused.  I

thought you didn't open your birthday

presents because you ran away from your

own party when your best friend told

everyone that you were adopted.

LUCY

I never said that; why would I say that?

TURNER

Why would your friends say it if you

hadn't said it?

LUCY

Kids lie all the time.

TURNER

May I remind you Lucy that you're under

oath?

LUCY

You may.

TURNER

And do you know that means if you lie

you could be in serious trouble?

LUCY

I do.

TURNER

So now that you and I have agreed to

tell the truth, where did you sleep last

night?

LUCY

In my bed at the Foster home.

TURNER

All right, Lucy.  If you're not going to

tell the truth, I am.  Your dad

kidnapped you last night and the police

found you sleeping in a seedy park a

hundred miles from here.  You're lying

right now because you're afraid.  Afraid

that everyone will see how scared and

frustrated you really are.  You're

afraid of hurting him, but now we need

to tell the truth.  The truth is deep

inside you know you're not getting what

you need from your father.  Isn't that

right, Lucy?

LUCY

"All you need is love."

LUCY

Daddy!  I did great, didn't I?

SAM

No, Lucy, you lied.

LUCY

Shhh!  Don't tell anyone.

MARGARET BROWN

Lucy, Mrs. Kerry's here to take you

back.

LUCY

I thought you'd be proud of me.  Jo Jo's

mom told him to lie on the stand and say

he never saw a needle in the house; and

he did, and now they're back together.

SAM

Jo Jo isn't us.  The truth, the truth,

when the judge hears the truth, he'll

know, he'll know we should be together.

LUCY

(bursting)

Nobody's interested in the truth, Daddy.

Nobody cares!

SAM

I CARE!  DO YOU HEAR ME?  THE TRUTH.

THE WHOLE TRUTH!  SO HELP ME GOD!!

SAM

Help me, God.  Help me, God.  Help me,

God...

GEORGE

Sam's my most reliable employee.  He's

never missed a day of work in eight

years.  Always warm, always friendly.

TURNER

Admirable qualities for a single father.

Mr. Walker, in these eight years, have

Mr. Dawson's responsibilities,

which...let me see...would include

bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n

Lows, and sweeping up the place...

increased?

GEORGE

No.  Not really.

TURNER

And isn't that because he's mentally

incapable of learning management skills

or working the cash register or even

making a cup of coffee?

RITA

Objection.  Leading the witness.

JUDGE MCNEILY

You may answer the question.

GEORGE

Well as a matter of fact, Sam and I have

been discussing a promotion that I was

planning on putting into effect at the

end of the week.

SAM

Oh boy!  Thank you, George!

TURNER

Yes.  Thank you, George.  Now, after

eight years, Sam can finally measure out

a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water.

Now, he must certainly be able to help

Lucy with her geometry.

RITA

Objection -

TURNER

No further questions.

RITA

...and when I ask another question?

IFTY

I answer in one sentence.

RITA

Yes.  Short and sweet.

IFTY

Yes.  One sentence.  Short and sweet.

My aunt was short and sweet.  But her

cooking was too spicy she...

SAM

Annie!  I can't believe it!

ANNIE

(visibly trembling)

Tell them to take me quickly.

RITA

Give me one minute with the judge.

RITA

Besides being Lucy's godmother, aren't

you also Lucy's piano teacher?

ANNIE

Yes.

RITA

Lucy's very lucky.  Didn't you graduate

Magna Cum Laud from the Julliard School

of Music?

ANNIE

Summa Cum Laud.

RITA

(delighted)

Excuse me.  Now Ms. Cassell, in all the

time you've known them, have you ever

questioned Sam's ability as a father?

ANNIE

Never.

RITA

Never?

ANNIE

Never.  Look at Lucy.  She's strong,

she's able to display true empathy for

people, all kinds of people.  I know you

all think she's as bright as she is

despite him.  But it's because of him.

DISSOLVE TO:

TURNER

Can Sam add?

ANNIE

Yes.

TURNER

How about multiplication?

ANNIE

He's learning.

TURNER

So what you're saying is that Sam can

not even multiply two times two?

ANNIE

I don't know about you, Mr. Turner, but

my fondest memories of my parents have

nothing to do with times tables or state

capitals.

TURNER

I bet he's knocking on your door all the

time with questions.

ANNIE

Yes.  All the time.  The last question

was whether to use Biz or Clorox to get

the grass stains out of Lucy's soccer

uniform.

TURNER

So let's see..he doesn't know math...he

can't even wash her clothes.  How about

puberty?  I can only imagine how much

insight he'll bring to approaching the

sensitive issues of a young girl's

development.

ANNIE

Mr. Turner, show me a father, any

father, who knows how to do that and

I'll give them the Parent of the Year

award.

TURNER

And you've had plenty of opportunity to

observe fathers, haven't you?

RITA

Objection!

TURNER

But the fact that Ms. Cassell hasn't

come out of her room in years might have

some effect on her perception.

JUDGE MCNEILY

I'll allow it.

ANNIE

I had twenty eight years in the world to

observe all kinds of fathers.

TURNER

What about your father, Ms. Cassell?

Since you appear to be an expert on

father-daughter relationships.

TURNER (CONT'D)

Excuse me, Ms. Cassell, I didn't hear

your response.  What about your father?

SAM

Objection!  No further questions!

TURNER

Excuse me, Mr. Dawson?

SAM

I said that's enough!  I will not allow

it!  Overruled!  Overruled!!

RITA

Thank you again, Annie.  You were truly

extraordinary.

SAM

Extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary.

RITA

Okay okay okay okay.  Well, Sam has his

big day on the stand tomorrow and we

need to work a little bit so that he's

as effective as you were.

SAM

Effective.  Very effective.

RITA

On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle

is a little hidden by that thingamajig,

so if you're having a hard time finding

it I'll just --

ANNIE

Noooooooo!

SAM

Annie's not quite ready to go outside

yet.

RITA

Okay, we'll just take our time.

RITA

Home!  Home!  HOME GODDAMNIT!  Juanita,

help Danny with his English assignment.

Ayude Danny un story...story...STORIO!

ANNIE

(rising from the dead)

I'm ready now.

RITA

(gently)

Good, fine, Sam?  Annie's ready.

RITA

Okay okay okay okay.  We'll work in the

library.  It's down the hall and to the

left.

RITA (CONT'D)

Hey, Danny.

(no answer)

Where's your father?

DANNY

(staring at TV)

Guess.

RITA

I don't want to guess.  Where is he?

(Sam watches Rita)

I told you I don't want to guess.

DANNY

Well where was he last night?

RITA

Working late.

DANNY

There you guessed it.

RITA

He said he was working late?

DANNY

That's what he said.

RITA

Well who did he say was taking care of

you?

DANNY

You.  But you said you were working

late.

RITA

I am working late.

DANNY

Then go work.

RITA

How was your day?

DANNY

You have to work.  Go work.

RITA

No.  How was your -

SAM

This is my favorite part.  Hey Dommy,

this one looks like he's suffering from

shell shock.

DANNY

Boy I guess we can shell it out... It

was a shell of a good hit.

SAM

(bellowing)

"Turtles in the half-shell, turtle

power!"  Rita!  Come this is the best

part.

SAM

You eat too fast.  Come watch the movie.

RITA

It's getting late.  We have to get to

work.

(handing him a suit)

This is my husband's.  He won't notice.

He's got ten more just like it.  Try it

on.

SAM

Bad?

RITA

No.  Very, very good.  But your tie's

crooked.

RITA (CONT'D)

Cross over once.  Loop it around on the

inside of your neck.

(her hand grazes his neck)

Slide the other side through the loop,

then tighten.

RITA (CONT'D)

Okay okay okay okay.  Our strategy is

that we're aggressively pursuing a

support system.  I'm going to ask you h

ow are you prepared to help Lucy in

school?

SAM

Let me see let me see let me see.

RITA

Sam!  I told you you have to stop that!

It makes you look stupid!  Okay okay

okay.  Try again.

(endless pause)

You say you will find her a tutor.  Then

I say, "How will you pay for it?"

SAM

Could you slow down?  Why do you eat so

fast?

RITA

(ignoring him)

We've gone over this a million times.

You've found a free tutoring service for

her at the YMCA.

SAM

But I didn't.  You did.

RITA

Can't you grasp the concept of

manipulating the truth?  Not lying.

Just a little tweak here and there.

SAM

No...You're so lucky.  You get to play

with Danny all the time.

RITA

He doesn't want to play with me.

SAM

Yes he does.  He does he does.  He

thinks you don't want to.

RITA

Oh that's ridiculous of course I want

to.

SAM

Tweak, tweak.

RITA

(exploding)

I drove around after work yesterday 'til

9:30 looking for a goddman razor

scooter!

SAM

(in his own world)

Tweak, squeak, peek peek...

RITA

Okay, why did you harass that young boy

at your home?

SAM

You know I didn't harass him, Rita.  You

know that, you know that!

RITA

Sam, I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner,

remember?  Okay?

SAM

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.  I didn't harass

him, Mr. Turner.  Mr. Turner -

(Sam can't keep a straight

face)

You don't look like him.

RITA

That's a blessing.

SAM

You're so much prettier.

RITA

(suddenly shy)

Thank you.  Now.

What makes you think you can take care

of a woman - I mean a young child - when

you have a hard time taking care of

yourself?

RITA

But who are you kidding?  Isn't Lucy

already smarter than you?

SAM

In some ways.  But in other ways, she's

not, I think.

RITA

You think?

SAM

I think.

RITA

Sam.  You've got to be firm on this.

SAM

I think in other ways I'm smarter than

her.  Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner.

In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than

you, Judge McNeilly.

RITA

Whoa!  Bring it down.

SAM

What parent doesn't want more for their

child?  To be more than the sum of the

parts of the whole of them.

RITA

Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a

little girl to love her daddy when she's

a baby, but once she loses respect for

you, what will you do?

SAM

(fierce)

I won't let that happen.  I won't.

RITA

How can you say that?

SAM

Respect is not just about how smart

someone is.  Smart is not just about how

smart someone is.

RITA

But what about Lucy?  Aren't you being

selfish?  Doesn't she deserve a better

life?  Don't you think she's just

pretending she's happy to not hurt your

feelings?

SAM

Lucy is happy!  We have fun!  We go to

Denny's, we go to video night.  I know

how to love her.  I know I'm not going

to able to go to law school and learn

how to be a mean person, but I know how

to love.  I know how to be her father,

Mr. Turner!

RITA

I know you do, Sam.  I know you do.

GEORGE

You look great, Sam.  What time do you

have to be in court?

SAM

Half day, half day.  I take the stand at

two.

GEORGE

Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non

fat.

SAM

Sprinkles or Cinnamon?

GUY

What is this?  I ordered an Americano,

not a latte.

SAM

Americano, Americano, not a latte.

SAM

I'm going to be late!  I'm going to be

late!

GEORGE

I'll call a taxi.

SAM

No, no, I can't wait.  I can't wait.

I've got to go right now.

TURNER

Your Honor, if the defendant doesn't

have enough interest in his daughter to

even show up -

RITA

Your Honor, I'm sure he'll be here any

moment.  This is an extremely important

day to Mr. Dawson.

RITA (CONT'D)

Your Honor, may I have a moment with my

client?

JUDGE MCNEILY

Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.

RITA

What the hell happened?

(sniffing the air)

What is that smell?  Mint?

RITA (CONT'D)

Sam, look at me.  Look at me!

(he does)

I will guide you like last night.

(Sam hugs her)

Not that part of last night, the other

part.  Now you can do it.  I know you

can.  Lucy needs you.

SAM

(a mile a minute)

Lucy needs me.

RITA

Yes, slow down because Lucy needs you.

SAM

Lucy needs you.

JUDGE MCNEILY

Ms. Harrison.  We need you!

RITA

How will you be able to pay for private

tutoring?

SAM

There's a free program at the YMCA.

Lucy can go there.

RITA

But don't you ever think it would be

better for Lucy if she lived with a

permanent foster family and you could

visit whenever you wanted?

SAM

The Fosters don't know her.  Why can't

she live with me and they can come visit

if they want to.  I'm firm on this.  And

I'm getting firmer.  Lucy belongs with

me.

RITA

Why?

SAM

Paul wrote the first part of the song

"Michelle".  He said to John, "Where do

I go from here?"  John had been

listening to Nina Simone.  There was a

line in it that went something like, "I

love you, I love you, I love you..."

They put that into the song.  It

wouldn't be the same song without that.

It made the song complete.  That's why

the whole world cried when they broke up

on April 10, 1970.

JUDGE MCNEILY

Did you get that, Mary?

TURNER

When you were Lucy's age, were you

living at home?

SAM

No.

TURNER

Were you living with your mother and

father?

SAM

No.

TURNER

Well then where were you living?

SAM

(very quietly)

In an institution.

TURNER

So your parents put you in an

institution?

SAM

Only after my mom got sick.

TURNER

What about your father?  Where was he?

SAM

Gone with the wind when Sam was born.

TURNER

So, you weren't raised by your mother?

SAM

I saw her I saw her.

TURNER

When?

SAM

Christmas, Easter and my birthday.

TURNER

Oh, once a year on your birthday.  So in

a way, the people at the institution

were your parents.  Were they nice to

you?

SAM

Some yes.  Some on.  Some yes.

TURNER

Did they hit you?

SAM

Sometimes.  Sometimes they did

sometimes.

TURNER

Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her

birthday party?

RITA

Objection!  Nobody hit anybody!

TURNER

Let me rephrase that, strong-armed.  So

what role model do you call upon as a

father when you're parenting Lucy?  The

head of the institution?  The Principal

the warden?

SAM

No.  Not Mr. Whitehead.  Not him.

TURNER

Then who?

SAM

Myself.

TURNER

you have the mental capacity of a seven

year old.  So you ask yourself, a seven

year old -

SAM

I am not a seven-year old.

TURNER

How to parent a fellow seven-year old?

SAM

Yes.  No.  What was the question?

TURNER

The question is: what makes you think

you can be a parent?  Your background?

Your IQ?  Your friends who can't even

testify for you?

RITA

Objection -

SAM

My friends -

RITA

Objection -

SAM

My friends love Lucy even if Rita

thought they weren't smart enough to

testify.  Even if she said you'd wipe

the floor with them.

TURNER

Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just

objected; that means you didn't have to

answer the question.  You can't even

follow the simple rules you've watched

here day after day.  You really think

you can raise a seven-year old?  A ten

year old?  A thirteen-year old?

(in his face)

That means she'll be six years more

advanced than you.

SAM

I've had a lot of time to think about

whatever it is that makes somebody a

good parent.  It has to do with

constancy.  It has to do with patience.

It has to do with listening.  To

pretending to listen when you can't even

listen anymore.

SAM (CONT'D)

It has to do with love, like she says...

SAM (CONT'D)

And I don't know where it's written that

a woman has a corner on that market,

that a man has any less of those

emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home

with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a

perfect parent!  Sometimes I forget he's

just a little kid...

(whispers from the courtroom)

We built a life together and we love

each other and if you destroy that, it

may be irrep, irrep, irrep...

IFTY

Irreparable.

IFTY (CONT'D)

Joanne, don't do that, please.  Don't do

it twice, not to him.  Then Meryl Streep

can't even look at Dustin Hoffman after

that.

TURNER

Right, "Kramer vs. Kramer."  Thank you

for the commentary, Mr. Bhutto.  It's

hard to find words isn't it, Mr. Dawson.

It's confusing.  It's confusing to know

what to say to Lucy half the time, isn't

it?

SAM

No, yes, no.

TURNER

No what?

SAM

Let me see let me see let me see.

TURNER

You don't know what?

SAM

Yes.

TURNER

Yes.  You're right, you don't know.  You

don't know enough to really raise your

daughter?

RITA

Objection.  These aren't questions,

these are attacks.

SAM

(frantic)

I am Lucy's father.

TURNER

Are you?  Are you really?  I'm not

talking about the fact that you got some

homeless woman pregnant.

RITA

Objection your Honor.  I motion a

recess.

JUDGE MCNEILY

Denied.  Get to the question, Mr.

Turner.

TURNER

The question is if you love your

daughter as much as they say you do

don't you think she deserves more?!

Don't you?  In your heart of hearts,

secretly question yourself every day?

Don't you?!

SAM

Yes.

TURNER

Was that a "yes?"

RITA

Objection.

SAM

Yes.  She does.  She deserves

everything.  In my heart of hearts.

TURNER

Yes she does.  And you agree with

everyone, you can't give her that?

SAM

(in unbearable pain)

Maybe.  Maybe everybody's right.

SAM (CONT'D)

No more no more!  Let it stop!  No more!

No more!  No more!

LUCY

No Daddy!  No Daddy!  No Daddy!

MARGARET BROWN

C'mon, Lucy.  It's time to say goodbye.

LUCY

NOOOO!  Don't let go don't let go don't

let go -

LUCY (CONT'D)

Don't let them Daddy don't let them!

Don't ever let me go!

MARGARET BROWN

Please help me.

RANDY

Your teacher told me you were an artist.

LUCY

You wear too much perfume.  You're

trying too hard.

RANDY

I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach

me how to paint.

LUCY

My daddy's coming today.  We're going to

open my birthday presents.  Why don't

you just go do something.

MAN

Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee,

could you clean this up?

MAN (CONT'D)

I said I need a refill and a towel over

here.

SAM

(snapping)

You need a towel?  A refill?  A glass of

water?  You need more than you already

have?  You have everything -

(all his fury and frustration)

Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take

my daughter, too!

SMASH CUT TO:

LUCY

You gave him the wrong address!  You're

hiding me from him!

LUCY

You're going to send me away now, aren't

you?

RANDY

(tenderly)

No.

INTERCUT:

RANDY

Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift

in.

RANDY (CONT'D)

You know, this wall really needs

something special on it.

LUCY

What's the longest any one of those kids

stayed with you?

RANDY

Megan stayed a little over a year.

LUCY

(averting her eyes)

Did you ever want any of them to stay

longer?

RITA (O.S.)

Sam it's me!  Open up!

RITA

I don't have time for this!  You were

supposed to show up for your first

evaluation.  And I leave work early to

get there and where the hell are you?!

Open the door!  Sam!  Open the goddamn

door!

(nothing)

Alright.  If you don't care enough to

open the goddamn door I'm outta here!

I've ruined my practice, I've alienated

my colleagues - I sent my kid off on a

fishing trip with his father so I could

work with you and you won't open your

goddman door for me?!  Fine!  THAT'S IT!

I've had enough!

RITA

Sam, it's Rita.  Can I come in?

SAM

No room.  No room.

RITA

Hey.  I lived in the East Village.  I

don't need a lot of room.

SAM

Sam makes life too hard.  Sam makes life

too hard on everyone.

RITA

Sam, I can go at least nine more rounds.

But you gotta let me in.  Please Sam.

Please.

RITA (CONT'D)

Thank you.  Now I can see your kind

eyes...George told me you needed a break

from work.

SAM

I don't want to work there anymore.  Too

many people.

RITA

Maybe we could find you a quieter job.

Because remember one of the judges

conditions is you have to earn more

money; you've got to keep earning more

money for when we get you Lucy back.

SAM

Lucy doesn't need me anymore.  She has a

new family.  She doesn't need me

anymore.

RITA

Is that what she said?

SAM

She didn't have to say it.  I may be

stupid, but I know.  I know.

RITA

Well that's the first stupid thing I've

ever heard you say.

RITA (CONT'D)

Sam, Sam you can get her back.  The

court favors reunification.  The only

thing that can block you is if the

foster family petitions to adopt.  And

from what I've heard, Lucy's making

their life miserable - that's our girl.

Sam, fight for her.

SAM

I tried.  I tried.

RITA

Try harder.

SAM

You don't know.  You don't know.

RITA

I don't know?

SAM

You don't know what it is to try and try

and never get there.  You were born

perfect, perfect.

RITA

Is that right?  Everyone else is perfect

but only Sam feels loss and pain?

SAM

That's right.  People like you don't

know.

RITA

People like me?

SAM

People like you don't know, don't know

what hurt feels like, people like you

don't feel, don't feel anything.

RITA

You think you got the market cornered on

human suffering?  Well let me tell you

something about "People like me."

People like me feel little and lost and

ugly and dispensable.  People like me

have perfect husbands screwing someone

far more perfect than me and my son, my

son hates me, I try too hard and I push

and he knows it and I talk in that

voice, that voice I promised I'd never

use, and I've screamed, I've screamed

horrible things to him, a five year-old

because he doesn't want to get in the

car at the end of a day and he stares at

me with such anger and I hate him then.

I know I'm failing you, I know I'm

disappointing you, I know you deserve

better but get in the fucking car!  It's

like every morning I wake up and fail,

and I look around and anybody, anybody

can pull it off, but somehow I can't.

And I know, I know I have everything,

and I'm still miserable and it's

pathetic.  I know it's pathetic.  No

matter how hard I try, something about

me will never be enough.

SAM

You're enough.  You're so much more than

enough.

SAM (CONT'D)

Lovely Rita...

RANDY

You're early.

SAM

All the lights were green.

RANDY

There's a reason for the court schedule.

You stopped showing up.  Lucy has had to

rebuild her life.

SAM

I want her back.  I can do it.  I know I

can.

RANDY

That's not up to me, but I'm telling

you, I will do everything in my power to

prevent Lucy from getting hurt again.

RANDY (CONT'D)

Whose dogs are these?

SAM

Supplemental income supplemental income -

bathe, walk and feed.  Sam Dawson meets

your canine needs.

(to dogs)

Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!

LUCY

You never came!  You never even called!

You forgot about me!  How could you

forget me!

SAM

I never forgot you.  I forgot me.

SAM (CONT'D)

I hate you I hate you I hate you!

SAM (CONT'D)

Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last

night...

SAM (CONT'D)

Gesundheit, Buster.  Buster has a cold.

But the letter had too many big words.

Pokey, sit.

SAM (CONT'D)

Dear Lucy.  Pokey sit.  Dear Lucy, I'm

sorry that I hurt you.  Every moment of

the day I thought about you.  Lucy in

the hammock, Lucy at school.  Lucy in

the sky...XXOO.  Daddy.  P.S. I love

you, recorded September 11th, the day

you took your first step.

SAM

Napa cabbage, excellent choice.  Purple

and green, purple and green.  Very rich

in Vitamin C.  Good choice. Very good

choice.

RITA

Hello, Sam.  Mr. Dawson.  Sam.  Dawson.

SAM

Hello, lawyer.

RITA

Shall we?

SAM

No.  We already did.  Don't tell

anybody.

RITA

Furthermore, my client has found a new

job, and is making every effort to find

a bigger apartment so that -

SAM

Here.

RITA

Oh, thank you.  What a...a lovely

barrette, Mr. Dawson.  It will look

great on Lucy.  Who I'm sure you bought

it for.  Furthermore, so that...there

will be more room for Lucy as she grows

up.

MARGARET BROWN

All of that is well and good but the

fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job,

missed his hearing, and did not even

show up for his visits with his

daughter...

RITA

The fact that my client went through

profound depression is the most natural

reaction any parent could have.

MARGARET BROWN

But once again he had no idea how his

behavior during that depression impacted

on his daughter.

RITA

In these next months, Mr. Dawson will be

expanding his support system to include

Social Service programs, tutors --

MARGARET BROWN

It's too late!  The foster family is

petitioning the court for sole custody

of Lucy and I fully support their

request.

IFTY

Isn't it illegal?  It's illegal to go

through stop signs.  It's illegal to

cross on the red.

RITA

It's not illegal.  It's very

complicated.  When a strong foster

parent lobbies for a child it changes

the equation.

ROBERT

They're reaching right through Sam as if

he doesn't exist.  As if he's a ghost.

RITA

There's one option we've never talked

about, Sam.

(very carefully)

I know what you went through the last

time you took the stand.  We could

settle out of court, ask for the most

incredible visitation rights - it would

almost seem like joint custody.

SAM

You're saying I don't have a chance.

That's what you're saying.

RITA

I'm not saying you don't have a chance.

ROBERT

That's what you said last time and look

where he is now.

SAM

Stop.  Rita's not saying I don't have a

chance.  Are you?  Tell me I have a

chance.

IFTY

Oh my God!  6:35 is Video Night at my

house and I'm not even there!

ROBERT

If we get there before you do we'll wait

for you - check!

BRAD

Sam get your dessert to go.

SAM

This is very hard to say.  I'm having my

dessert here.  With Rita.  I'm not

coming to video night.

RITA

Sam - if you want to go...

SAM

I said no, Rita.

RITA

I know, but if you -

SAM

What?  Do you want me to go?

RITA

I didn't say that.  But do you want to

go?

SAM

Where?

RITA

Nevermind.

SAM

Fine.

RITA

Fine.

IFTY, ROBERT & BRAD

Fine.

RITA

I've got it.

SAM

I've got it.

SAM (CONT'D)

It's good to chew.  You're eating more

slowly.

SAM (CONT'D)

Coconut Rhubarb.  Sidebar, we need to

talk.  Sidebar.

RITA

(carefully)

Yes we do.

SAM

I need to get Lucy back.  We need, we

need - to be professional.

RITA

Do you know what that means?

SAM

When dealing with Starbucks' customers,

be friendly but not familiar.  I can be

your friend.

RITA

(oddly touched)

Thank you, Sam.

SAM

You need to leave your husband.

RITA

(her armor up again)

Oh, my marriage isn't so bad.

SAM

'Life is very short and there's no time

for fussing and fighting, my friend.'

RITA

(undone)

It's just...it's just that...I've never

lost anything.

LUCY

We've made $22.36.  That's seven

dollars, 64 cents less than thirty.

RANDY

Well that's one way of looking at it.

LUCY

Daddy?!

RANDY

What are you doing here?

SAM

I live here.  This is where I live.

LUCY

This is where you live?  So close to me?

SAM

I wanted to be close to you.  I wanted

to be closer.  Look at my apartment

number.

(it's number 9)

John was born on October 9th.  His son

was born on October 9th.

LUCY

John met Yoko on November 9th.

SAM

His mother lived at 9 Newcastle,

Liverpool.

LUCY

Newcastle.  9 letters.  Liverpool - 9

letters...

RANDY

Lucy, give me one minute with your

father.  Sam, I consider myself an

understanding person but I don't

understand this.  You can't close the

distance between you and Lucy with a new

address.  We go to court in a week -

SAM

I don't want to spend half my visit with

Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy.  I

don't want to waste one more minute.

LUCY

(from the doorway)

Does Buster still have his cold?

SAM

He's better, much better.  Now I'll have

one box of mint chocolate cookies.

LUCY

That'll be three-eighty six.

LUCY & SAM

(in unison)

Let me see let me see let me see...

That's one dollar and 14 cents less than

five.

SAM

Lucy Lucy.  What are you doing?!  You

could have really hurt yourself.  What

are you doing?

LUCY

I couldn't sleep.  Daddy, did you know

that Warren G. Harding was the twenty

ninth President of the United States?

SAM

No.

LUCY

Remember - the twenty-ninth President.

In case the Judge asks.

SAM

She couldn't sleep.

RANDY

Give me my daugh -

(she stops herself)

Give me - I'll take Lucy.

SAM

Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three

times, tell her two stories and give her

half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a

third of a glass of milk she'll sleep.

Good night.

RANDY

(tenderly)

Lucy.  Come here.

RANDY (CONT'D)

I made us a midnight snack.

RANDY (CONT'D)

I understand that you want to see your

daddy.  And I don't want to keep you

from him.  I honestly don't.  So you

tell me when you want to see him.  You

can see him anytime you want.  But we

have to arrange it first.  Do you

understand?

(Lucy nods)

Now would you like a snack?

LUCY

Thank you.  Goodnight.

RANDY

(words caught in her throat)

Goodnight, Lucy.

RITA

My husband left this when he moved out.

SAM

Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid.

RITA

(entering)

Nice place.  I worry.  I worry

sometimes...

SAM

You worry you did the wrong thing?

RITA

I worry that I've gotten more out of

this relationship than you.

SAM

No no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have

the lawyer that never loses.

RITA

(covering)

That's me...okay, let me see, let me

see, let me see.

(pulls out notes)

They're going to put Bill and Randy on

the stand first and then you.

SAM

Them first, then me.  They're a nice

couple.  They have a nice house.  She's

pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell.

The manager of the salad bar is gonna

testify, isn't he?  That will help us.

RITA

Absolutely.

SAM

Nobody believed that George Harrison

could really be a song writer.  But he

wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and

Paul said it was one of the best songs

on ABBEY ROAD.

RITA

(tenderly)

George was always my favorite Beatle.

SAM

Lucy's was Paul.

LUCY

Now.

RANDY

What honey?

LUCY

Now.  I want to see him now.

RANDY

She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I

was gonna turn back and tuck her in to

her bed...with the pink canopy...and the

quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd

wake up at our house...

(fighting the ache in her soul)

...and want to come home.

RANDY (CONT'D)

I was gonna tell the judge that I could

give Lucy the kind of love she never

had.  But I would be lying.

SAM

I hope I hope I hope that you're saying

what I think you're saying even though

you're not saying it.

RANDY

Goodnight.  I'll see you in court.  Save

me a seat...on your side.

SAM

Randy!  If I tell you I can't do it

alone, will you tell the judge?

RANDY

(turns gently)

No.

SAM

Promise?

RANDY

Promise...

SAM

I've looked and looked for a mother for

Lucy.

Help, I need someone, help, not just

anyone.  You're the red in Lucy's

painting.

SAM

Penalty!  Rules broken.  Penalty,

please!

OBNOXIOUS MOM

Get her!  Phillip, you get her!

ROBERT

I saw that!  You gave him a secret

signal!  Didn't you?

IFTY

Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls

are round - on sale at Kmart.  The earth

is a ball, too...

SAM

Penalty!  Repeat!  Rules broken!

Penalty!

RITA (O.S.)

Penalty?!  Sue him!  Kick his ass outta

the game!

SAM

Play ball!  Play ball!

FADE TO BLACK.
