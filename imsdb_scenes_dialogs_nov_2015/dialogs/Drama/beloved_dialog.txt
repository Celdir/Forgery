CUT TO:

HOWARD

We gonna need food. Wait here.

HOWARD

Come on!

DENVER (OS)

Bul?

DENVER

Where you goin?

HOWARD

We gotta go!

HOWARD

Bye, Denver. You take care.

DENVER

Bye? Bul?

DENVER

No..Bul...

DENVER

Now what you go and do that for?

FADE OUT;

BABY SUGGS

Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to

see me some lavender. You got any

lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do.

SETHE

No. Sorry.

BABY SUGGS

Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if

you've got an appetite for color.

SETHE (OS)

Oh wait...

BABY SUGGS

Oh, that's fine. Fine.

BABY SUGGS

They'll be all right. I'm surprised they

lasted here this long.

SETHE

I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.

BABY SUGGS

What'd be the point? Not a house in the

country ain't packed to the rafters with

some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our

ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come

back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You

lucky. You got one child left, still

pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had

eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one

of them gone from me. Four taken, four

chased and all, I expect, worrying

somebody's house into evil. My first born

- alls I can remember of her now is how

she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her

little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they

slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight

children and that's all I remember.

SETHE

(returning to her work)

You remember Halle.

BABY SUGGS

Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all

of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had

Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years...

My two girls, sold and gone before I

could even a heard about it, and them

without their grown up teeth yet. My

third child, my son after Halle...I let

that straw boss have me for four months

so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he

had him traded for lumber anyway and me

pregnant with his child. I couldn't love

that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the

rest either. God take what He

would....and He did...

SETHE

The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were

here.

BABY SUGGS

Those boys didn't even know him. You had

six whole years of marriage to my Halle

Fathered every one of your children. A

blessing. I learned hard that a man's

just a man, but a son like that...like

Halle..now that's somebody.

SETHE

Just got a few more things to do, then

I'll start supper.

INTERCUT;

DENVER

Mama?

SETHE

What is it baby?

DENVER

You think maybe when daddy comes, he

could talk to the baby ghost. Maybe make

her behave and then people won't be

scared of here no more.

SETHE

I don't know.

DENVER

Why won't she ever settle?

SETHE

She's mad like a baby gets mad. You

forgetting how little it is. She wasn't

even two years old when she died. Too

little to understand.

DENVER

For a baby she throws a powerful spell.

SETHE

No more powerful than the way I loved her.

DENVER

What do you pray for Mama?

SETHE

Oh, I don't really pray anymore. I just

talk.

DENVER

About what?

SETHE

Oh, about time. How some things go. Pass

on. Some things just stay.

DENVER

What things?

SETHE

Like, the place I was at before here -

Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and

every tree and blade of grass on it died -

it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you

go and stand in the place where it was,

what happened there once, will happen

again.

DENVER

If it's still there, waiting, that mean

nothing ever dies?

SETHE

Nothing ever does. That's why I had to

get my children out. No matter what.

That's why you can never go there.

DENVER

You never tell me all what happened. Just

that they whipped you and you run off

pregnant with me.

SETHE

You don't need to know nothing else.

DENVER

(nods)

I saw a white dress kneeling next to you

when you was praying.

SETHE

White? Maybe it was my bedding dress.

Describe it to me.

DENVER

Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons

coming down the back.

SETHE

Buttons. Well, that's not my bedding

dress. I never had a button on nothing.

What else?

DENVER

A bunch at the back. On the sit down

part.

SETHE

A bustle?

DENVER

I don't know what it's called.

SETHE

You say it was holding on to me. How?

DENVER

Kneeling next to you while you were

praying. I mean, talking. It looked just

like you.

SETHE

Well, I'll be.

DENVER

I think it was a sign. I think maybe

baby's got plans.

SETHE

What plans?

DENVER

I don't know, but that dress holding onto

you got to mean something.

SETHE

Maybe. Maybe it does.

DENVER

She's crawling again.

FADE OUT;

FADE IN;

SETHE

Paul? Paul D.? Is that you?

PAUL

(smiles)

What's left.

(He rises)

How you been girl, besides barefoot?

SETHE

You looking good.

PAUL

Devil's confusion. He lets me look good

long as I feel bad.

SETHE

How long has it been?

PAUL

'Bout eighteen years, I figure.

SETHE

Eighteen years.

PAUL

And I swear I been walking every one of

them. Mind if I join you?

SETHE

You want to soak them? Let me get you

some water.

PAUL

No, uh, uh. Can't baby feet. A whole more

tramping they got to do yet.

SETHE

You're not leaving right away, are you?

You stay awhile.

PAUL

Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs,

you..Where is she?

SETHE

Dead.

PAUL

Aw no. When?

SETHE

Eight years now. Almost nine.

PAUL

Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard.

SETHE

Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard

part. Sorry you missed her though. Is

that what you came by for?

PAUL

That's some of what I came for. The rest

is you.

PAUL

The truth be known, I go anywhere these

days. Anywhere they let me sit down.

SETHE

Come on inside.

PAUL

Porch is fine. Cool out here. Sit with

me.

PAUL

So Baby Suggs is gone. Somehow never

thought death would find her.

SETHE

It finds everyone.

PAUL

We managed well enough without meeting

it.

SETHE

I suppose.

SETHE

I wouldn't have to ask about him, would

I?...You'd tell me if there was anything

to tell, wouldn't you?

PAUL

You know I would. But I don't know any

more about what happened to Halle now

than I did then.

PAUL

You must think he's still alive.

SETHE

No. I think he's dead. It's just not

being sure that keeps him alive.

PAUL

What did Baby Suggs think?

SETHE

Same. Ha, listen to her, all her children

dead and she felt each one go the very

day and hour it happened.

PAUL

When she say Halle went?

SETHE

1855. Same day my baby was born.

PAUL

You had that baby, did you? Damn, never

thought you'd make it. Running off

pregnant.

SETHE

Had to. Couldn't be no waiting.

PAUL

All by yourself too.

SETHE

Almost. A white girl helped me.

PAUL

Then she helped herself, God bless her.

SETHE

We got spare rooms. You could stay the

night, if you had a mind to.

PAUL

You don't sound too steady in the offer.

SETHE

Oh it's..it's truly meant. I just hope

you'll pardon my house.

PAUL

My house. I like the sound of that.

PAUL

You got company?

SETHE

On and off.

PAUL

Good God! What kind of evil you got in

there?

SETHE

It's not evil..It's just..just sad. Come

on. Just step through.

PAUL

I thought you said she died soft as cream.

SETHE

(busying herself in kitchen)

Oh that's not Baby Suggs. That's my

daughter. The one I sent ahead with the

boys before I run off.

PAUL

She didn't live?

SETHE

No.

PAUL

The boys too?

SETHE

No, they alive - they run off before Baby

Suggs died. The one I was carrying when I

left Sweet Home is all I got left.

PAUL

Well, probably best..If a Negro boy got

legs he ought to use them. Sit down too

long, somebody figure out a way to tie

them up.......

(the image disturbs Sethe)

You by yourself then?

SETHE

Me and Denver... my daughter.

PAUL

No man?

(Sethe shakes head "no")

And that's all right by you?

SETHE

It's all right by me...I cook at a

restaurant in town. Sew a little on the

sly....

SETHE

You look more done in by a walk through

my front hall than all those eighteen

years of walking put together.

PAUL

Got that right.

DENVER

Daddy?

SETHE (OS)

Won't you stay a little while? Can't

nobody catch up on eighteen years in a

day.

SETHE

Baby, this here's Paul D. Garner...Paul,

this is my Denver...Paul's the last of

the Sweet Home men.

PAUL

Good morning Miss Denver. It's a

pleasure.

DENVER

Good morning, Mr. D.

PAUL

Garner, baby. Paul D. Garner.

DENVER

Yes sir.

PAUL

Glad to get a look at you. Last time I

saw your mama, you were pushing out the

front of her dress. She's a fine looking

young lady, Sethe. Fine looking. Got her

daddy's sweet face.

DENVER

You knew my father?

PAUL

Knew him. Knew him well.

SETHE

Of course he did. I told you, he's from

Sweet Home. Paul may stay with us a

while. Won't that be nice, having an old

friend stay a spell?

PAUL

If that's all right with you, that is?

DENVER

We have a ghost here, you know.

PAUL

We met. But sad, your mama said. Not

evil.

DENVER

No sir, not evil. But not sad either.

PAUL

What then?

DENVER

Lonely.

SETHE

I don't see how it could be lonely

spending every minute with us like it

does.

DENVER

It's my sister. She was just a baby when

she died in this house.

PAUL

Reminds me of that headless bride back

behind Sweet Home. Remember that Sethe?

Used to roam them woods regular.

DENVER

(annoyed, resentful)

Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home.

Says it was never sweet and it sure

wasn't home.

SETHE

Girl, mind yourself!

PAUL

Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe.

SETHE

But it's where we were. All together.

It's where I met your father. And it

comes back on us whether we want it to or

not....

DENVER

Then why don't you ever tell me about it?

SETHE

Denver, start up the stove. Paul must be

hungry.

PAUL

Don't go to no trouble on my account.

SETHE

Bread's no trouble. The rest I brought

back from where I work. Least I can do,

cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner

home. You got any objections to pike?

PAUL

If he don't object to me I don't object

to him.

DENVER

Where's he going to sleep? Baby Sugg's

room got no sheets or nothing.

SETHE

We'll figure it out.

DENVER

Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr.

Garner. Then you two can talk about Sweet

Home all night long.

SETHE

(explodes)

What's the matter with you! I never knew

you to behave like this!

PAUL

Leave her be, Sethe. I'm a stranger to her.

SETHE

That's just it. She got no cause to act

up with a stranger.

SETHE

Baby, what is it? Did something happen?

DENVER

I can't no more! I can't no more!

SETHE

Can't what? What can't you?

DENVER

I can't live here! I don't know where to

go or what to do but I can't live here.

Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by.

Nobody even knows I'm alive.

PAUL

What she talking about 'nobody speaks to

you'?

SETHE

It's the house. People don't...

DENVER

It's not! It's not the house! It's us!

It's you!

SETHE

Denver!

PAUL

Leave off, Sethe. It's hard for a young

girl living in a haunted place. That

can't be easy.

SETHE

(growing irritated)

It's easier than some other things. Come

here, baby..

PAUL

I'm a grown man with nothing new left to

see or do and I'm telling you it' ain't

easy. Maybe you oughta move.

SETHE

No!

PAUL

Sethe!

SETHE

No. No moving. No leaving. It's all right

the way it is.

PAUL

You going to tell me it's all right with

this child half out of her mind.

SETHE

(holding Denver in her arms)

I got a tree on my back and a haunt in my

house and nothing in between but the

daughter I'm holding in my arms. No more

running - from nothing! I will never run

from another thing on this earth, you

hear! I took one journey and I paid the

ticket but let me tell you something,

Paul D. Garner; it cost too much! Do you

hear me?! It cost too much! Now sit down

and eat with us or leave us be!

PAUL

What tree, Sethe?

SETHE

Huh?

PAUL

What tree on your back? I don't see

nothing growing on your back.

SETHE

It's there all the same.

PAUL

Who told you that?

SETHE

White girl. That's what she called it. I

never seen it and never will. But she

said that's what it looked like. A

chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That

was 18 years ago. Could have cherries by

now for all I know...

PAUL

I don't follow.

SETHE

I had milk, see. I was pregnant with

Denver but I had milk for my baby girl

that I sent ahead with the boys. I hadn't

stopped nursing her when I sent her and

the boys ahead of me. Anybody could smell

me long before they saw me. Nothing I

could do about it. All I knew is I had to

get my milk to my little girl. Nobody was

going to nurse her like me. Nobody was

going to get it to her fast enough or

take it away when she had enough..nobody

knew she couldn't pass her air if you

held her up on your shoulder, only if she

was lying on your knee..Nobody knew that

but me...

PAUL

We was talking about a tree, Sethe.

SETHE

Schoolteacher's boys drag me into the

barn and took my milk...

JUMP CUT TO:

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)

..Held me down in that barn and took it.

JUMP CUT TO:

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)

They were like boulders on me. Their

hands over my mouth and on my shoulders

and my legs.

JUMP CUT TO:

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)

I couldn't move. Alls I could see was the

loft above their heads.

JUMP CUT TO:

PAUL

The loft?

SETHE

I told Mrs. Garner on them. She had that

lump on her neck and couldn't speak but

her eyes rolled out tears, I remember.

Them boys found out I told on 'em and

Schoolteacher made one open up my back,

and when it closed it made a tree.

PAUL

They used cowhide on you?

SETHE

And they took my milk.

PAUL

They beat you and you was pregnant?

SETHE

And they took my milk!

PAUL

Aw Lord, girl.

PAUL

GOD DAMN IT! HUSH UP! Leave this place

alone! Get the hell outta here!

PAUL

YOU WANT TO FIGHT, COME ON! GOD DAMN IT!

SHE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU! SHE GOT ENOUGH!

LAP DISSOLVE:

SETHE

Why don't you...take a rest..I'll call

you when we're ready.

PAUL

Sure you don't want me to help clean up?

SETHE

No..you'd just get in my way. Denver and

me'll do it.

HALLE

How's this?

SETHE

Here?! out in the open?!

HALLE

Look around - can you see anybody?

HALLE

Then nothing can see us neither.

HALLE

You are a beautiful sight.

SETHE

Don't talk stupid.

HALLE

You're my wife now! I can talk as stupid

as I like about you!

(she giggles)

I ain't never loved nothing like you

before, Sethe.

(Sethe is moved)

And after I get mama out...then I get us

out too. And you'll see, baby girl...

(smiles)

we're gonna have us a liiife..

SETHE (O.S.)

You sure nobody can see?

PAUL A

Damn. I don't get why she picked him.

PAUL D

Halle's got that way about him. That way

a woman feels he's doing it all for her,

not for himself at all.

PAUL A

I can't see nothing so special about Halle.

PAUL F

What about what he's doing for his mama?

PAUL A

Fool thing, if you ask me. By the time he

buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to

somebody that old and worn.

SIXO

Freedom mean something anytime it come.

MR. GARNER

Raccoon must've got into my corn. Damaged

a few so, no use throwing them out...

MR. GARNER

Sethe, get the butter there.

NEIGHBORING FARMER

You spoil these nigger boys.

GARNER

Maybe you got boys on your farm. My

nigger's are men. Not a boy among'em.

Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway.

NEIGHBORING FARMER

Beg to differ Garner. Ain't no nigger men.

GARNER

Not if you scared. But if you a man

yourself, you'll want your niggers to be

men too.

NEIGHBORING FARMER

Wouldn't have no nigger men around my

wife.

GARNER

Neither would I..Neither would I.

SETHE

I'll call you when there's something to

eat.

PAUL

Sethe.

(she stops and looks)

I was thinking of looking for work around

here. What do you think?

SETHE

Ain't much. River mostly. And hogs.

PAUL

Hogs is fine.

PAUL

I don't need much, Sethe. Eat, sleep,

sing a little when it strikes me. I don't

ask for more to..to live somewhere.

SETHE

All right. It's...it's fine with me.

PAUL

Your girl Denver. Seems she's of a

different mind.

SETHE

Don't worry about her. She's a charmed

child. Nothing ever touch her too bad.

From the beginning. Everybody I knew dead

or gone, but not her.

(pause)

You got to know something, though - this

here ain't no better life. It's just not

that other one. What I do here - all I

ever do - is keep Denver from that

other..So if you stay, there's no more

talk about Sweet Home or anything else. I

won't let the past in my yard again.

Getting me and Denver through this here

life is all that matters. You understand?

PAUL

Dangerous to love anything that much,

Sethe. Best thing is to love everything

just a little bit..that way, when it

breaks or runs off or gets taken, well

maybe you'd have a little love left over

for the next one.

SETHE

Don't be asking me to choose, Paul D.

There ain't no choice here.

PAUL

That's the whole point. I'm not asking

you to choose. Just want to know if

there's some space for me. Want to know

if it's more than "you can stay", "it's

fine"..more like, "I want you here Paul".

SETHE

Maybe we should leave things the way they

are.

PAUL

How are they?

SETHE

We get along.

PAUL

What about inside?

SETHE

I don't go inside.

PAUL

Sethe, if I'm here with you, with Denver,

you can go anywhere you want. Jump, if

you want to, 'cause I'll catch you. Go as

far inside as you need - I'll hold your

ankles. Make sure you get back out. I'm

not saying this because I need a place to

stay. I told you, I'm a walking man, but

I been heading in this direction for

seven years. When I got here and sat out

there on the porch, waiting for you,

well, I knew it wasn't the place I was

heading toward. It was you. We can make a

life girl. A life.

SETHE

(scared)

I don't know. I don't know.

PAUL

Leave it to me. See how it goes. No

promises, if you don't want to make any.

Just see how it goes, all right?

SETHE

All right. We'll see how it goes.

PAUL

You willing to leave it to me?

SETHE

Well..some of it.

PAUL

(smiles)

Some?...Well okay...some.

DENVER

What is it? What's wrong?

SETHE

Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Lay back down.

DENVER

You think baby ghost's really gone?

SETHE

Don't know.

DENVER

I miss her.

DENVER

I do. Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would

never hurt me. She was my sister. When I

was little, after the boys left, I used

to think that she and me both were

waiting for daddy to come. And once he

did, she wouldn't be mad no more.

(Sethe listens sadly)

DENVER

Wish he'd shut-up...He's ruined

everything.

SETHE

No, he hasn't. He won't.

(hesitates)

He..he wants to takes us to the

carnival next Thursday...

DENVER

You mean, go out where they'll be other

people?

SETHE

Dress up a little bit. Wear our hats.

What do you think?

DENVER

(downplaying her excitement)

Maybe....

SETHE

Maybe...All right...all right.

(difficult for her to say)

Can I ask you something?

(Denver nods, her back to

Sethe)

I was wondrin'..What you think about

us...maybe... maybe thinking we could

start...if we got an idea to, thinking we

could start.. countin' on...

(she stops)

DENVER

On what mama? Countin' on what?

SETHE

Something.

VARIOUS PASSERS-

BY

Hey Denver!...Hi there Denver!

CARNIVAL BARKER

All Pickaninnies free!!

PAUL

Two pennies and an insult well spent in

my opinion to see the spectacle of

whitefolks making a spectacle of

themselves.

PAUL

Mind if I take a sip?

FADE OUT;

DENVER

Look. What is that?

SETHE

You from around here?

PAUL

Those shoes look brand new.

SETHE

What might your name be?

BELOVED

Beloved.

PAUL

Beloved. You use a last name, Beloved?

BELOVED

Last. No..just Beloved..

(she spells it)

B..E..L..O..V..E..D...

SETHE

That's a pretty name Beloved. Take off

your hat and I'll make us something. We

just got back from the carnival over near

Cincinnati-

PAUL

Miss...Miss, you want to lay down?

DENVER

I'll take her up. She can sleep in baby

Suggs room - that all right Mama?

SETHE

Course.

PAUL

(whispers to Sethe)

Look at her feet? They're not walking

feet. More like she rode from somewhere

all the way here.

PAUL

Sounds like the croup.

SETHE

Is she feverish, Denver?

DENVER

No. She's cold.

SETHE

Then she is. Fever goes from hot to cold.

PAUL

Could have the cholera.

DENVER

(adamant)

She's not sick!

DENVER

Beloved? Beloved I'm here...what is it?

BELOVED

Heavy..this place is heavy.

DENVER

Would you like to sit up?

DENVER

Can I get you anything? Are you hungry?

DENVER

..then you fold it over like this see.

This here used to be where my brothers

and me slept. I was always at the top.

BELOVED

How you get so smart?

DENVER

I ain't so smart.

BELOVED

Yes you are!

DENVER

Well, I used to go to Lady Jones. She'd

teach us with songs how to spell and

count.

BELOVED

You don't go no more?

DENVER

No I...I had to stop going.

BELOVED

You so smart. Tell me about your

brothers.

DENVER

Well..they're names were Howard and..

DENVER

..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used

to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down

on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die-

witch stories. He said they would protect

us...And if I learned them, they would

protect me if ever they were gone...

PAUL

You gonna just feed her, from now on?

SETHE

Denver likes her. She's no real trouble.

PAUL

But don't she have a home? Some place to

go?

SETHE

Didn't mention one. I thought we'd wait

until her breathing got better. She still

sounds a little lumbar.

PAUL

She breathe like she can eat, she could

blow this whole house down. And all those

sweets.

SETHE

Sometimes the body needs that sugar for

strength when it's trying to recover

after an illness.

PAUL

But that's just it. She don't seem sick.

Something funny about her.

SETHE

Funny? How?

PAUL

Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look

sick. Good skin, bright hands and strong

as a bull.

SETHE

She can hardly walk without holding onto

something.

PAUL

That's what I mean. Can't walk but I

passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning

and saw her lifting the rocker with one

hand.

SETHE

You didn't?

PAUL

Don't tell me. Ask Denver. She was right

there.

SETHE

Denver. Come in here a minute.

SETHE

Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the

rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one

hand. That so?

DENVER

I didn't see no such thing.

DENVER

Have you seen her? I can't find her.

SETHE

Who?

DENVER

Beloved.

SETHE

She need a marker. Somethin' to tell me

where she is. But I ain't got no money.

ENGRAVER

What you got then?

ENGRAVER

What you want it to say?

SETHE

I was thinking what the preacher say at

the funeral. Dearly Beloved.

ENGRAVER

(touching her)

For ten minutes I give you one word for

free.

SETHE

Oh!...I didn't know you were there.

BELOVED

Can I help?

SETHE

Help what, honey?

BELOVED

Where you go in the morning?

SETHE

Work. I work in a restaurant.

BELOVED

What time you go?

SETHE

Little after the sun come up. I like to

make a loaf of bread before I go. How you

feelin'?

SETHE

You remember your mother at all?

BELOVED

(scratching back of her head)

I remember a woman who was mine and I

remember bein snatched away from her.

BELOVED

I'm helpin make your bread.

BELOVED

Where your diamonds?

SETHE

Diamonds? What would I be doing with diamonds?

BELOVED

On your ears.

SETHE

Wish I did.

(beat)

Hmm..come to think of it, I had some

crystal once. A present from Mrs. Garner -

woman I worked for at Sweet Home.

DENVER

I never saw you with no earrings.

SETHE

Gone. Long gone.

BELOVED

Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds...

DENVER

(to Beloved)

Ma'am don't talk about Sweet Home.

BELOVED

(ignoring her)

Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds.

SETHE

Well..this lady I worked for in Kentucky

gave them to me when I got married..

SETHE

..What they called married back then. I

remember going up to her in the kitchen

to tell her. I'd help her make ink for

Mr. Garner in the kitchen. I was fool

enough to think I was going have some

kind of ceremony...maybe even a new

dress..

(CONTINUES AS WE CUT TO;)

SETHE

Best unbraid that hair.

DENVER

Tomorrow.

SETHE

Today's always here. Tomorrow never.

DENVER

It hurts.

SETHE

Comb it everyday, it won't..

BELOVED

Your woman never fixed up your hair?

PAUL

What?

SETHE

My woman?..You mean my mother?

SETHE

If she did I don't remember. I don't

think I saw her but a few times.

BELOVED

Tell me 'bout her.

SETHE

..I remember once, she picked me up and

carried me behind the smokehouse... The

only thing I do remember in fact...

SETHE

...She opened up her dress and right on

her rib, right here, was a circle and a

cross burnt right into the skin....

PAUL

(interrupts her)

Sethe.

SETHE

What?

PAUL

Any more beans?

SETHE

...anyway, she points to this mark and

says to me "This is your ma'am. I am the

only one whose got this mark now. The

rest all dead. If something happens to me

and you can't tell me by my face, you can

know me by this mark"..Scared me so...

I couldn't think of anything to say so I

said "Yes Ma'am..but how will you know

us? Mark me too. Mark the mark on me

too."

DENVER

Did she?

SETHE

No. She slapped my face. I didn't

understand it then. Not until I had a

mark of my own...

BELOVED

What happened to her?

SETHE

Don't know. Everybody done?

PAUL

Well, as long as we're all asking

questions, getting to know each other..

(to Beloved)

Why don't you tell us a little bit about

yourself?

DENVER (O.S.)

(defensively)

She don't remember nothing.

PAUL (O.S.)

You be surprised what you start

remembering once you start talking.

BELOVED (O.S.)

Can I have some more pudding?

NAN

That's your mama - right there.

NAN

..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me

and your Mama was taken by the men many

times..She threw them other babies

away..the others from the whites, without

names, she threw them away..But you she

gave the name of the black man. She had

her arms around him, child. The others,

she did not put her arms around.

Never...Never...

PAUL (O.S.)

Ain't you got no brothers or sisters?

BELOVED (O.S.)

I don't have nobody.

DENVER

She has us now!

PAUL

You been here five weeks, we still don't

know nothing bout you..

SETHE

Paul, Stop it. Denver bring those dishes.

PAUL

What was you looking for when you came here?

BELOVED

This place. I was looking for this place

I could be in.

PAUL

Somebody tell you about this place?

BELOVED

She told me. When I was at the bridge,

she told me.

SETHE

Must be somebody from the old days.

PAUL

How'd you come? Who brought you?

BELOVED

I walked here. A long, long, long, long

way. Nobody bring me.

PAUL

You had new shoes. If you walked so long

why don't your shoes show it?

SETHE

Paul D. stop picking on her.

PAUL

I want to know! Where'd you get them

shoes and that dress you had on?

BELOVED

I take the shoes! (coughs) I take the

dress! (coughs) The shoe strings don't

fit! I...

SETHE

You all right?

BELOVED

(whispers)

I want to go to sleep now.

DENVER

Come to my room. I can watch out for you

up there.

SETHE

What's the matter with you?

PAUL

I don't understand what the hold is. It's

clear why she holds onto you, but I just

can't see why you holding on to her.

SETHE

What you care who's holding on to who?

Feeding her is no trouble. And she's nice

company for Denver.

PAUL

We was just starting to feel a little

like a family ourselves.

SETHE

Is that what's got your teeth on edge?

PAUL

I can't place it. It's a feeling in me.

SETHE

You wanna feel somethin!? ... Feel how it

is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody

there not worrying you to death about

what you got to do each day to deserve

it. And if that don't get it, feel how it

feels to be a colored woman roaming the

roads with anything God made liable to

jump on you. Feel that!

PAUL

I know every bit of that, Sethe. I wasn't

born yesterday and I never mistreated a

woman in my life!

SETHE

Well, that makes one of you in this

world.

PAUL

(surprised)

One? Not two.

SETHE

No. Not two!

PAUL

What Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by

you. He never left you.

SETHE

Ha, what'd he leave then if not me, huh?

PAUL

I don't know but it wasn't you. That's a

fact.

SETHE

Then he did worse - he left his children.

PAUL

You don't know that.

SETHE

HE WASN'T THERE! He wasn't where he said

he would be! I had to pack my babies off

ahead of me, on their own, so I could

stay behind to look for him...Underground

agent said by Sunday we had to leave..

Sunday came and he wasn't there.

PAUL

He couldn't get out of the loft, I expect.

SETHE

Loft? What loft?

PAUL

(hesitates)

The one over your head... The one in the

barn.

SETHE

He saw? He told you he saw?

PAUL

You told me. The day I came here. You

said they stole your milk. I never knew

what messed Halle up. That was it, I

guess. I seen him the day after you left.

Says where you been Halle? All he says to

me was "the loft". I asked him what he

meant not going with you but he never

answers me. But I knew was something

broke him. Not one of them years of

Saturdays, Sundays and nighttime extra

never touched him. But whatever he saw go

on in the barn that day broke him like a

twig.

SETHE

He saw them boys do that to me and let

them keep on breathing?

PAUL

A man ain't a Goddamn ax, Sethe.

Chopping, hacking, busting every Goddamn

minute of the day. Things get to him.

Things he can't chop down cause they

inside him. The last time I saw him, I

knew he was broken for good...

SETHE

What did he say?

PAUL

Nothing.

SETHE

What did you say? Didn't you say anything

to him?

PAUL

I couldn't.

SETHE

Couldn't?! Why the hell not?!

PAUL (VO)

I tried to kill Brandywine - man

Schoolteacher sold me to. Don't know what

possessed me...Me and about 45 other

prisoners were being walked from Kentucky

to Virginia...then on to Georgia. Two

places I don't ever want to see again.

WHITE MAN

Look at Mister there...

(referring to the rooster)

You go tell these niggers where to go

there Mister! Crow'em right outta here!

PAUL

I didn't mean to tell you that.

SETHE

I didn't plan on hearing it.

PAUL

I can't take it back but I can leave it

alone.

PAUL

Let's do that..let's leave it alone now.

SETHE

(more to herself)

Let it alone. Just sit down and leave it

be! Yeah that would be nice. Would be

even nicer to lose it altogether - if I

had my choice. Halle did. Other people's

brains stopped, went crazy. How sweet

that would have been. Me and Halle

squatting by that churn, smashing cold

lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in

the world..

PAUL

Sethe, don't do this..

SETHE

What a relief to just stop it all right

there, huh?!! Close it shut! Squeeze that

butter...But I had three children on

their way to Ohio and nothing would have

changed that! And you tell me he didn't

leave me!!

PAUL

Guess she's feeling better, huh?

DENVER

Where'd you learn to dance?

BELOVED

Nowhere. Look at me do this!

BELOVED

Now you! Come on! Come on!

DENVER

Why you call yourself Beloved?

BELOVED

In the dark my name is Beloved.

DENVER

What's it like where you were before?

BELOVED

(a thoughtful expression)

Dark. I'm small in that place. I'm like

this here.

DENVER

Were you cold?

BELOVED

Hot. Nothing to breathe there. No room to

move.

DENVER

How did you get here?

BELOVED

I wait; then I got on the bridge. I stay

there in the dark, in the daytime, in the

dark in the daytime. Long time.

DENVER

All this time you were on the bridge?

BELOVED

No. After. When I got out.

DENVER

Why'd you come here?

BELOVED

To see her face.

DENVER

Ma'am's? Sethe's?

BELOVED

Yes. Sethe.

DENVER

You my sister, ain't you? You really are.

DENVER

You won't leave us, will you?

BELOVED

No. Never. This is where I am.

DENVER

I knew it. I knew. First time I saw you

and you said your name. And when you

touched me - real gentle. And familiar.

Like I'd felt that touch before.

DENVER

Don't tell mama. You musn't tell her who

you really are. I don't know what she'd

do! Please, you hear?

BELOVED

Don't tell me what to do? Don't never

tell me what to do!?

DENVER

But..but I'm on your side. I want to

protect you...

BELOVED

(stands above Denver)

She's the one! She's the one I need! You

can go but she's the one I have to have!

DENVER

No. Beloved please! Don't go! I didn't do

nothing! We were dancing! Don't go!....

BABY SUGGS

I'm not here to tell you all to clean up

your lives and sin no more....I'm not

here to tell you we're the blessed meek

I'm still in Kentucky.

AMY

You got anything on you, gal, pass for

called Wilson. I seen pictures and they

have the prettiest velvet.

SETHE

Boston - is that far?

AMY

Farther than Ohio.

SETHE

Must be velvet closer by.

AMY

Not like in Boston. Be so pretty on me.

You ever touch velvet? Or even seen it?

AMY

SETHE

I can't get up.

AMY

There's a house back yonder. Well, not a

house with people in it - more like a

lean-to near the river.

SETHE

How far?

AMY

Make a difference, does it? You stay

here, snake might get you.

SETHE

Well, he may come but I can't stand up,

let alone walk...and God help me, I can't

crawl.

AMY

Come on Lu! You got to move faster than

that. You won't get to Ohio til you

ninety years old, you keep moving that

ways.

AMY

Never know it to look at me but I used to

be a good size. Nice arms, everything.

That was before they put me in the root

cellar...

AMY

...Mama worked for these people here to

pay for her passage but then she had me

and died right after so I had to work

for'em.. I was fishing off the Beaver

once and a nigger floated right by me. I

don't like drowned people, do you? Your

feet remind me of him. All swole like.

AMY

You all bloody back here. Gal you a mess.

Undo your dress - let me see.

Spiderwebs all I can do for you. What's

in here ain't enough. I'll look

outside...Maybe I ought to break them

blossoms open and let the pus run..

(rises)

That you ain't dead yet Lu's a miracle.

Make you a bet..You make it through the

night, you make it all the way...

AMY

It's gonna hurt now..Anything dead coming

back to life hurts. Stop wiggling, girl.

Lots of places. I don't remember them

She don't love me like I love her. I

BELOVED

I want you to touch me on the inside

part.

Ever since you come here - feel like I

got a new devil to face.

BELOVED

You have to touch me. On the inside part.

And you have to call me my name.

PAUL

Ain't no chains on me no more. I don't

BELOVED

PAUL

Beloved.

PAUL

Look here Sethe..You ain't gonna like

it...See, it's not the..a man

can't...what I mean is, it ain't really

weakness I can fight, that girl is doing

it. I know you think I never liked her

nohow, still don't, but she is doing it

to me anyway. Fixing me, Sethe, she's

fixed me and I can't break it...

SETHE

Man, you make me feel like a young girl,

you coming by to pick me up after work.

Nobody ever did that before. Better watch

out, I might start looking forward to it.

SETHE

Got to rinse this out.

SETHE

You get off early or what?

PAUL

I took off early.

SETHE

Anything the matter?

PAUL

In a way of speaking.

SETHE

No, no. They got plenty of work with them

pigs..More they can handle. I just..

You ain't gonna like what I'm about to

say, Sethe.

SETHE

Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it

or not.

PAUL

I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do

that for me?

SETHE

You came by here to ask me that!? You are

one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't

like it!...Don't you think I'm a little

too old to start that all over again?

PAUL

Think about it.

SETHE

Mercy.

SETHE

I been on my feet all day, Paul D.

PAUL

Where I been? Sitting down!?

SETHE

Stop! I don't have the legs for this!

PAUL

Then give'em to me.

SETHE

You need some babies..somebody to play

with in the snow.

PAUL

I sure would like to give it a try. Need

a willing partner though.

SETHE

I'll say..Very, very willing.

SETHE

Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on.

SETHE

You got to learn more sense than that.

SETHE

Evening, girl.

SETHE

Now I know you not sleeping out there

tonight, are you Paul D.?

(Paul doesn't reply)

You come upstairs tonight. Where you

belong...and stay there.

BELOVED

She likes him here...

(to Denver)

Make him go away.

DENVER

She'd be mad if he leaves.

DENVER

OOoo..didn't that hurt you?

BELOVED

It's like my dreams...I get two dreams,

see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The

other I being swallowed. Sometimes it's

hard to keep my head on my neck, or these

legs connected to my hips...One day I

think I might wake up and I'll be in

pieces..

(Looks at tooth)

Maybe it's starting.

DENVER

(cleans Beloved's mouth)

Oh stop. It's just a tooth. Probably

wisdom. Does it hurt?

BELOVED

Yes.

DENVER

Then why don't you cry?

BELOVED

What?

DENVER

If it hurts, why don't you cry?

SETHE

What you think about Schoolteacher?

HALLE

He white, ain't he?

SETHE

I mean, is he different like Mr. Garner

was?

HALLE

How was he different?

SETHE

Well, he and Mrs. Garner - they ain't

like other whites I seen before.

Mr. Garner always spoke soft, for one.

Mrs. Garner too.

HALLE

Don't matter. Loud or soft, what they

say is the same.

SETHE

Mr. Garner let you buy out your mother.

Found that house for her to live in from

those friends of his in Ohio...

HALLE

Yep. He did.

SETHE

Well?

HALLE

If he hadn't, she would have dropped in

his cooking stove.

SETHE

Still, he did it. Let you work off her

fee, lending yourself out on Sundays. He

could of said no. He didn't tell you no.

HALLE

No, he didn't tell me no. She worked here

ten years. If she worked another ten, ya

think she would have made it? I pay him

for her last years and in return he got

you, me and three more coming..

SETHE

He always treated you fair. Called you

all men - said he never wanted niggers on

his farm.

HALLE

That's just it. We was men because he

said so. We was men because we was on his

land. You think he be calling us men if

we ever walked off his land?

SETHE

When we walk, don't matter what they call

you. You'll be free.

HALLE

Sethe..baby girl, that ain't gonna

happen. Not by walking, anyway.

SETHE

What you mean?

HALLE

Schoolteacher in there told me to quit

lending myself out.

SETHE

But..then..how you gonna buy yourself

out? Or them?

(points to the children)

Or me?

HALLE

Ain't gonna be no buying us out, like I

did with mama. Or them. As far as

Schoolteacher concerned, ain't no other

life ahead for any of us but this one.

SETHE

Halle....what we going to do?

HALLE

(whispers)

Sixo, ya know he creeps out at night..he

says the way they took my ma'am..he says

freedom is that way. He and Paul A. got a

plan.  They heard of this man, what they

call an underground agent...if we do what

he says, don't need no buy out.

SETHE

You mean...? But what if we caught?

What'd they do to us? To the children?

HALLE

Same thing they're doing now, honey -

only quicker.

SCHOOLTEACHER

(OS)

Which one are you doing?

BOY (OS)

Sethe?

SCHOOLTEACHER

No, no. That's not the way. I told you to

put her human characteristics on the

left; her animal ones on the right. And

don't forget to line them up.

MRS. GARNER

I don't think I can swallow that.

Too thick. I'm sure it's too thick.

SETHE

Want me to loosen it up with a little

water?

MRS. GARNER

No. Take it away. Bring me some cool

water, that's all.

SETHE

Yes ma'am...

MRS. GARNER

Yes, you can have quite a few.

(drinks)

Mmmm. Thank you Sethe. Now tell me, I

know Halle's no trouble but the others,

the Pauls and Sixo - how's my brother-in-

law handling them? All right?

SETHE

Yes Ma'am. Look like it.

MRS. GARNER

They do what he tells them?

SETHE

They don't need telling.

MRS. GARNER

Good. That's a mercy. I know he's no Mr.

Garner. But after he died, I had no else

to turn to. I would've had to sell one.

It wasn't even enough selling Paul F. And

in my condition. I needed help. People

said I shouldn't be alone here with

nothing but Negroes. And he is a learned

man being a schoolteacher...

MRS. GARNER

...I know his ways might be a little more

strict but as long as the men do as

they're told I'm sure it'll be fine. All

right, I'm through.. Talking makes me

tired.

SETHE

Yes ma'am.

MRS. GARNER

My God Sethe..what happened to you?

WOMAN

Hurry up. You're late.

SETHE

(hands her the children)

Here!

HOWARD

But ma'am...

SETHE

Just go with her! Do what I tell ya!

SETHE

Put sugar water on that cloth for her to

suck so she won't forget me til I come.

WOMAN

Where you going?

SETHE

Halle wasn't there. I gotta go back.

WOMAN

You crazy..

SETHE

Take em out. Now! I'll get there myself.

I got her milk...I'll get there...Don't

worry.

SETHE

Go..Go! Now!

BULGAR

Mama?

BOY WITH HORSEWHIP

You nigger bastard..

CO-WORKER 1

Hey - you like this work so much maybe

you best get in the chute with the

others. You ain't got much more sense

than they do.

PAUL

Ain't just a job reason to sing. Other

things a man's got to look forward to

that a job just a way to spend your day

til the good times arrive.

CO-WORKER 2

Good times? Ain't no such day.

STAMP PAID

Now, now...it's all a state a mind, right

Paul D. If you can think it, it can

happen.

PAUL

More than that. When a man can make plans

then a man can make good times happen.

CO-WORKER 1

Oh the man's got plans! You saving up for

a gold mine, boy.

(more laughter)

PAUL

Better then gold, my friend. Me and my

woman's planning on starting a family.

PAUL

New life. Born free, hear! Now if that

don't define a good tine, I don't know

what does.

CO-WORKER 2

Nothing born free ever again.

PAUL

What you talkin? Nobody owns us no more.

Nobody gonna own my children neither.

CO-WORKER 2

Children inherit what come before'em.

Just cause you can't see no chains, don't

mean they not there. We're not free men.

We're somewhere between freedom and

chains. And as long as the world is

white, that's where we're stayin.

STAMP PAID

May I?

PAUL

Free country. No matter what anybody says.

STAMP PAID

I like the way you think, boy. Good. Good

to think that way. Friend of mine, Baby

Suggs was her name...sort of became a

preacher in these parts..that was her way

of thinking too. When she was at her

best, that is.

PAUL

You knew Baby Suggs?

STAMP PAID

Oh yes...You're not one of her Sweet Home

men, now are you?

PAUL

Yes sir...Me and my brothers and her son.

STAMP PAID

Oh, I see now.

PAUL

Sethe told me she died soft as cream.

STAMP PAID

Well...maybe on the outside.

PAUL

Why is that?

STAMP PAID

You don't know, son, do you? See I had to

figure that out first.

PAUL

Know what?

PAUL

Who is it?

STAMP PAID

That there's a picture of Sethe.

PAUL

Sethe?

(studies it)

Nah, that ain't her mouth. I can see

where you might think it around the eyes

but that there ain't her mouth. Besides,

why would some black woman's picture be

in the paper?

STAMP PAID

You don't read son, do you?

(Paul shakes head NO)

You want me to read to you?

SETHE

Already fed the girls. You eat?

(he shakes NO)

Want something?

SETHE

Best you come inside.

SETHE

I don't have to tell you about Sweet

Home. What it was. But maybe you don't

know what it was like for me to get away

from there.

SETHE

I did it. I got us all out. Without Halle

too. Up til then it was the only thing I

ever did on my own. Decided. And it came

off right like it was supposed to..

SETHE

We was here. Each and every one of my

babies and me too. I birthed them and I

got 'em out and it wasn't no accident. I

did that! I had help, of course, lots of

that, but still it was me doing it; me

saying, "Go on" and "Now!". Me having to

look out. Me using my own head. But it

was more than that. It was a kind of

...'thinking-about-myself' I never knew

nothing about before. It felt good. Good

and right. I was big, Paul, and deep and

wide and when I stretched out my arms all

my children could get in between. I was

that wide. Look like I loved them more

after I got them here. Or maybe I

couldn't love'em proper in Sweet Home

'cause they wasn't mine to love. But when

I got here, when I jumped off that wagon -

there wasn't nobody in the world I

couldn't love if I wanted to....

DISSOLVE TO:

SETHE (VO)

I had 28 days...28 good days of free

life.....

SETHE (VO)

...of getting up like I always did,

getting dressed before the sun came out,

and then realizing I had to decide myself

what to do with the day...

SETHE (VO)

...Days of watching my children sleep

away the morning...And taking care of my

baby like it was the most important thing

I had to do...

SETHE (VO)

I'd hear my boys laughing a laugh I ain't

never heard. And for a second I'd get

scared - scared someone might hear them

and get mad...

SETHE (VO)

Then I remembered...and if they laughed

that hard til it hurt, that would be the

only hurt they had all day....

SETHE (VO)

We had us days of company...

SETHE (VO)

...of ease and real talk. Talks about the

Fugitive Bill, Dred Scott or book

learning...Talks as quiet or as stormy as

we wanted...

SETHE (VO)

...And when everyone would gather to hear

Baby Suggs, I saw something I ain't never

seen before in my whole life...

BABY SUGGS

Let the children come!

BABY SUGGS

(with joy)

Let your mother's hear you laugh!!

BABY SUGGS

Let the grown men come!!

BABY SUGGS

LET YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN SEE YOU

DANCE!

BABY SUGGS

Now...you women...I want you to cry. For

the living. For the dead....Just cry.

SETHE

....Something in me knew Halle was never

gonna knock on our door. He was never

gonna see what I saw that day. I saw what

men look like...and I saw mothers, for

the first time.

SETHE (VO)

I think it was Stamp Paid who started it.

He walked six miles to the riverbank,

slid into a ravine, reached through blood

drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes,

wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the

State just to bring us those berries.

BABY SUGGS

(laughs)

What a sight you are, Stamp.

STAMP PAID

Worth it though. Just one bite of these

berries and you feel down right anointed.

SETHE

She's too little for that, Stamp. Her

bowels be soup.

BABY SUGGS

It'll sickify her stomach..Now go wash up

round back...crazy fool..

SETHE

It was real nice of him.

BABY SUGGS

He's a good one, no doubt of that. I can

get three, maybe four pies out of this.

Seems a shame just for us though. I'm

gonna invite Ella and John over...

SETHE

How 'bout if I make a couple of chickens

to back it up?

SETHE (VO)

And that's how it began...

SETHE (VO)

...Three pies became twelve...two hens

became five turkeys...

SETHE (VO)

...and Ella and John turned into almost

ninety others...

SETHE (VO)

... Everybody ate so well and laughed so

much...

SETHE (VO)

...it made them angry...

SETHE (VO)

The pies, the turkeys...the bread pudding

and shortbread..the one whole block of

ice brought all the way from Cincinnati -

it made 'em mad...Loaves and fishes were

Jesus's powers...they did not belong to

an ex-slave who never had a white boy

beat her, who had her freedom bought, who

rented a house from white folks that

hated slavery worse than they hated

slaves...It made'em furious - her

thoughtless generosity and un-called for

pride...She had over stepped...offended

them by giving too much...and they left

their disapproval there so's you could

smell in the air the whole next day...

SETHE (VO)

Later on I wondered why no one warned

us...why no one saw them coming and ran

to 124 to tell us...

CUT BACK TO:

CUT BACK TO:

CUT BACK TO:

SETHE (VO)

...There's a Look whitefolks get..a Look

every Negro learns to recognize along

with his ma'am's tit..That righteous Look

that's like a flag going up the pole..the

righteousness that announces the whip,

the fist, the burning, the lie...long

before it happens in the open...

SETHE

Howard!...Bulgar!

SETHE

The shed!...Get in the shed!...Run!

NEPHEW

What she go and do that for?...What she

go and do that for?

SHERIFF

You all better go on.

(to Schoolteacher)

Nothing here to claim, I guess.

Look like your business is over. Mine's

started.

SHERIFF

I'll have to take you in. No trouble now.

You've done enough to last you....

SHERIFF

You come quiet, here, and I won't have to

tie you up.

STAMP PAID

Sethe. You take my arm and gimme yours.

SHERIFF

I'm going out here and send for a wagon.

BABY SUGGS

I beg you pardon..I beg your pardon..

BABY SUGGS

Excuse me..but the child needs

nursin..needs the mother's milk..

SHERIFF

Then she's best come too.

BABY SUGGS

One at a time!...And you gotta clean

yourself up!

WHITE BOY

Mama says Wednesday. She says you got to

have them fixed by Wednesday.

WHITE BOY

You hear, Baby? She says Wednesday.

BABY SUGGS

(taking the shoes)

I beg your pardon..Lord, I beg your

pardon..I sure do....

CUT TO:

PAUL

Your love is too thick, Sethe.

SETHE

Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't love

at all...I did stop him. I took and put

my babies where they'd be safe...

PAUL

Didn't work though, did it?

SETHE

It worked.

PAUL

How? Your boys gone, you don't know

where. One girl dead, the other can't go

farther than the yard. How did it work?

SETHE

They ain't at Sweet Home! Schoolteacher

ain't got'em!

PAUL

Maybe there's worse.

SETHE

It ain't my job to know what's worse.

It's my job to know what is and keep them

away from what I know is terrible. I did

that.

PAUL

What you did was wrong, Sethe.

SETHE

I should have gone back there? Taken my

babies back there?

PAUL

There could have been a way. Some other

way.

SETHE

What way?

PAUL

You got two feet, Sethe. Not four!

PAUL

You can set aside supper for me... Might

be late getting back...

SETHE

After all I told you, Paul D. and after

telling me how many feet I have, you

think saying goodbye is gonna break me

into pieces?

SETHE

You're a sweet man.

SETHE

So long, Paul D.

BELOVED

What do these do?

SETHE

My Lord...where'd you dig up those?

DENVER

There for skating on the ice.

We have another pair and half of another,

I think.

BELOVED

Can we try them?

SETHE

Go ice skating? Ha...

(beat)

Why not?

DENVER

You sure mama?

SETHE

Strikes me that after your man leaves, it

might just be the wrong time to be

scrubbing floors... might just be the

perfect time to go ice skating.

SETHE

Go get the shawls..and find me an old

shoe for that half a pair...

DENVER

Come on, ma'am...try!

BABY SUGGS (V.O.)

...All I remember is how she loved the

bottom of burned bread. Her little

hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they

slapped me".

SETHE (VO)

..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If

you can't tell me by my face, look here."

SETHE

I made that song up. I made it up and

sang it to my children...

SETHE

...Nobody knows that song but me and my

children.

BELOVED

I know it.

DISSOLVE TO:

SETHE

Back stiff?

DENVER

OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor

or the skating.

SETHE

Could be that fall you took.

DENVER

That was fun.

DENVER

Should I wake her?

SETHE

No, let her rest.

DENVER

She likes to see you off in the morning.

SETHE

I'll make sure she does. But first I'm

going  make up a nice, big breakfast

against that cold outside.

DENVER

Won't you be late for work?

SETHE

Don't matter. First time I'll be late in

nine years. No great trouble..Whatever

goes on out there goes on with or without

me showing up on time... don't matter...

(looks at the girls)

The world is in this room, baby. This is

all there is and all there needs to be.

STAMP PAID

You missed the Clearing meeting three

Saturdays running.

STAMP PAID

Folks came.

BABY SUGGS

Folks come. Folks go.

STAMP PAID

Here, let me carry that.

BABY SUGGS

I got a delivery around here. Name of

Tucker.

STAMP PAID

(points)

Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.

STAMP PAID

Well?

BABY SUGGS

Well what?

STAMP PAID

This Saturday - you coming to Call or

what?

BABY SUGGS

If I call them, and they come what on

earth am I going to say to them.

STAMP PAID

Say the Word!

STAMP PAID

The Word. What you was put here to speak.

BABY SUGGS

That's the last thing they took from me.

STAMP PAID

But you got to do it. You got to. Can't

nobody Call like you. You have to be

there.

BABY SUGGS

What I have to do is get in my bed and

lay down. I want to fix on something

harmless in this world.

STAMP PAID

What world are you talking about? Ain't

nothing harmless down here.

BABY SUGGS

Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow

neither.

STAMP PAID

You getting into bed to think about

yellow?

BABY SUGGS

I likes yellow.

STAMP PAID

Then what? When you get through with blue

and yellow, then what?

BABY SUGGS

Can't say. It's something can't be

planned.

STAMP PAID

You blaming God. That what you're doing?

BABY SUGGS

No, Stamp. I ain't.

STAMP PAID

You saying whitefolks won. That what you

saying?

BABY SUGGS

Those white things have taken all I had

or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck

in this world 'cept for white folks..They

just don't know when to stop.

STAMP PAID

You saying nothing counts?

BABY SUGGS

I'm saying they came into my yard.

STAMP PAID

You saying God give up? Nothing left for

us but pour out our own blood?

BABY SUGGS

I'm saying they came into my yard.

STAMP PAID

You punishing Him, ain't you?

BABY SUGGS

Not like He punished me.

STAMP PAID

You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.

BABY SUGGS

Was a time I knew what was.

STAMP PAID

You still know.

BABY SUGGS

What I know is what I see: a nigger woman

hauling shoes.

STAMP PAID

Aw, Baby.

STAMP PAID

We have to be steady. "These things too

will pass". What you looking for? A

miracle?

BABY SUGGS

No. I'm looking for what I was put here

to look for: the back door.

SAWYER

What the hell you thinking, girl?

Strolling in here this late?

SETHE

Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say

nothing to me this morning.

SAWYER

What? What? You talking back to me?

SETHE

I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.

SAWYER

You better get them pies made!

SAWYER

Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they

don't eat it.

SETHE

Make it the way I always do.

SAWYER

Yeah. Too sweet.

(he exits)

ELLA

Where you been keeping yourself? I told

John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.

STAMP PAID

Oh I been out.

ELLA

Out where?

STAMP PAID

Was over to Baby Suggs.

ELLA

What you want there? Somebody invite you

in?

STAMP PAID

That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite

to look after her people.

STAMP PAID

Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you

might know who she is.

ELLA

Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't

know about. What she look like? You sure

that wasn't Denver?

STAMP PAID

I know Denver.

ELLA

You sure?

STAMP PAID

I know what I see.

ELLA

Might see anything at all at 124.

STAMP PAID

True.

ELLA

Better ask Paul D.

STAMP PAID

Can't locate him.

ELLA

He's sleeping in the church.

STAMP PAID

The church!

ELLA

Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in

the cellar.

STAMP PAID

It's cold as charity in there! What he do

that for? Any number'll take him in.

ELLA

Can't nobody read minds long distance.

All he have to do is ask somebody.

STAMP PAID

Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody

offer? What's going on? Since when a

black man come to town have to sleep in

the cellar like a dog?!

ELLA

Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few

days he been there.

STAMP PAID

NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all

about it and don't give him a hand? That

don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you

been pulling colored folk out the water

more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you

can't offer a man a bed?! A working man

who can pay his own way?

ELLA

He ask, I give him anything.

STAMP PAID

Why's that necessary all of a sudden?

ELLA

I don't know him that well.

STAMP PAID

You know he's colored? What else there to

know?

ELLA

Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I

don't feel like it.

STAMP PAID

It's her, ain't it?

ELLA

Her who?

STAMP PAID

Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in

there and you don't want nothing to-

ELLA

Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see

bottom!

STAMP PAID

Girl, give it up! We been friends too

long to act like this.

ELLA

Well, who can tell what went on in there?

I never even knew who Sethe was or none

of her people.

STAMP PAID

You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.

ELLA

I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid

eyes on her till she showed up here. And

how'd she make it and her husband didn't?

And where is he? And how she have that

baby in the woods by herself? Said a

whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe

that? Well, I know what kind of white

that was.

STAMP PAID

Aw, no, Ella.

ELLA

Anything white floating around in the

woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's

something the Lord tells me I don't want

no part of.

STAMP PAID

You was friends.

ELLA

Till she showed herself.

STAMP PAID

Ella.

ELLA

I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to

their own children.

STAMP PAID

What's any of that got to do with Paul

D.?

ELLA

What run him off? Tell me that!

STAMP PAID

I run him off.

ELLA

(surprised)

You?

STAMP PAID

I told him...Showed him the newspaper.

About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that

very day.

ELLA

You didn't tell me that. I thought he

already knew.

STAMP PAID

He didn't know nothing. And nobody.

Except her, from when they was at that

place Baby Suggs was at.

ELLA

He knew Baby Suggs?

STAMP PAID

Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.

ELLA

And he left when he found out what Sethe

did?

(Stamp sits)

What you say casts a different light on

it, I guess...I thought-

ELLA

But you didn't come here talking 'bout

Paul. You came asking about a new girl.

STAMP PAID

That's so.

ELLA

Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or

what she is.

STAMP PAID

You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere

you look you see one.

ELLA

You know as well as I do, Stamp, that

people who die bad don't stay in the

ground.

SETHE (VO)

Beloved, she my daughter...She mine. She

come back to me of her own free will and

I don't have to explain a thing.. She had

to be safe and I put her where I knew she

would be. But my love was tough and she

back now. She come back to me in the

flesh...I won't never let her go. I'll

explain to her, even though I don't have

to. Why I did it. How if I hadn't killed

her she would have died and that is

something I couldn't let happen to her.

When I explain she'll understand, cause

she understands everything already..And

she ain't even mad...When I put that

headstone up I wanted to lay in there

with you, put your head on my shoulder

and keep you warm and I would have if

Bulgar and Howard and Denver didn't need

me, because my mind was homeless then. I

couldn't lay down with you then. No

matter how much I wanted to. I couldn't

lay down nowhere in peace, back then. Now

I can. I can sleep like the drowned, have

mercy. She come back to me, my daughter,

SETHE (VO)              DENVER

DENVER (VO)

FADE TO;

DENVER (VO)

..I swallowed her blood right along with

my mother's milk. She played with me and

always came to be with me whenever I

needed her. Me and her waited for our

daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt

me. I love my mother but I know she

killed one of her own, and tender as she

is with me, I'm scared of her because of

it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing

that happened that made it all right to

kill her own, could happen again.

Whatever it is, it comes from outside

this house, outside the yard. So I never

leave this house and I watch over the

yard so it can't happen again ... I have

to keep it away from my sister...I'll

protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...

BELOVED (VO)

I am not separate from her. There is no

place where I stop. Her face is my own

and I want to be there in the place where

her face is and to be looking at it

too...a hot thing..In the beginning I

could see her. I could not help her

because the clouds were in the way. But I

could see her. The shining in her ears. I

look hard at her so she will know that

the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose

her again. I see her face which is mine.

It is the face that was going to smile at

me in the place where we crouched before

I come up out of the blue water. Sethe's

is the face that left me. Sethe's sees me

in her and I see the smile. She is my

face smiling at me. It is the face I

lost. Now we can join..a hot thing.

SETHE (VO)

SHE IS MINE...

SETHE (VO)

CANNOT LOSE HER AGAIN.

SETHE (VO)

DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

BELOVED (VO)

YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

SETHE (VO)

YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?

BELOVED (VO)

YES.

SETHE (VO)

YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?

YOUR FACE IS MINE.

SETHE (VO)

WILL YOU STAY?

BELOVED (VO)

WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?

Howdy.

STAMP PAID

This is hard for me. But I got to do it.

Two things I got to say to you. I'm a

take the easy one first.

PAUL

If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.

STAMP PAID

I come looking for you to ask your

pardon. Apologize.

PAUL

For what?

STAMP PAID

You pick any house, any house where

colored live. Pick any one and you

welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing

'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But

you welcome anywhere you want to be. My

house. John and Ella. Miss Lady

Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got

to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for

each and every night.

Well I...I did get offered one place but

I just wanted to be off by myself a

Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought

PAUL

Just me.

STAMP PAID

You planning to do anything about it?

PAUL

Oh yeah. I got big plans.

WHITE MAN

Hey!!

STAMP PAID

(on his feet)

Yes sir.

WHITE MAN

I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works

over by the slaughterhouse. Said she

lived on Plank Road.

STAMP PAID

Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways.

Mile, maybe.

WHITE MAN

You don't know her? Judy? Works in the

slaughterhouse.

STAMP PAID

No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road.

'Bout a mile up thataway.

WHITE MAN

Look here..There's a cross up there, so I

guess this here's a church or used to be.

Seems to me like you ought to show it

some respect, you follow me?

STAMP PAID

Yes sir..You right about that. That's

just what I come over to talk to him

about. Just that..

PAUL

You remember your price, Stamp?

STAMP PAID

Never found out.

PAUL

I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always

wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for

my brother Paul F. Must of been more than

nine hundred dollars cause she use that

money for Sweet Home for almost two

years. But then they hung my other

brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess

he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what

was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't

surprised when I found out they tracked

down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her

price must have been higher than all of

us - her being property that reproduced

itself without cost. A breeder.

STAMP PAID

No use thinking these things now.

PAUL

Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our

price in the future? How are children's

children's children gonna know what they

cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are

they gonna pay for us, if we free?

STAMP PAID

Children ain't gonna need to know that

kind of thing.

PAUL

They'll know. They'll know as soon as

they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp.

It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down.

Schoolteacher didn't just change the

outside, he changed the mind..and the

blood..and what it carries...and what

it's worth..

STAMP PAID

I don't believe that. I won't.

PAUL

There was a rooster named Mister down at

Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with

that butter all over his face and me with

an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister -

sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like

king on a throne. He was a hateful thing.

Bloody and evil..But he was better than

me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay

what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd

be cooking a rooster named Mister. But

wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D.

again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was

never no beating under Mr. Garner.

Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't

a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man

not work, kill, starve, pull out his own

heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling

that? And it strikes me, it's got to be

cause we were something else. And that

something was less than a chicken sitting

in the sun on a tub.

STAMP PAID

I said I had two things to say to you. I

only told you one. I have to tell you the

other.

PAUL

I don't want to know.

STAMP PAID

I was there Paul D...There in the yard.

When she did it.

PAUL

What yard? When who-

PAUL

Jesus.

STAMP PAID

It ain't what you think.

PAUL

You don't know what I think.

STAMP PAID

She ain't crazy. She love those children.

She was trying to outhurt the hurter's

all.

PAUL

Leave off..

STAMP PAID

She was only-

PAUL

Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when

she was a girl. She scares me and I knew

her when she was a girl...

STAMP PAID

You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't

believe you.

PAUL

She scares me. I scare me. And that girl

in her house scares me.

STAMP PAID

Who is she? Where she come from?

PAUL

Don't know. Just shot up one day from a

stump.

STAMP PAID

She what run you off? Not what I told you

'bout Sethe?

PAUL

Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this

one thing. How much is a nigger supposed

to take?

STAMP PAID

All he can. All he can.

PAUL

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

FADE OUT;

DENVER

You shouldn't be in here?

BELOVED

What do you know about it? I sleep where

I want.

DENVER

You best leave that quilt alone. That was

grandma's quilt.

BELOVED

Breakfast ready? I'm hungry!

SETHE

Morning.

DENVER

Morning, ma'am.

SETHE

You hungry?

DENVER

No, ma'am.

DENVER

I'll finish those. Why don't you sit

down?

BELOVED

You don't sit with me!!

SETHE

Baby, don't be like that.

BELOVED

You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with

people who leave me!

SETHE

Don't talk like that. Your mama loves

you.

BELOVED

I had another dream last night.

(as she eats)

The dead man laying on top of me and I

had nothing to eat. And the ghosts

without skin stuck their fingers in me

and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in

the light..

SETHE

Don't say those things. You forget about

those dreams..

BELOVED

You gave me the bad dreams. You left me

behind...

SETHE

Mama told you - I'd give up my own life,

every minute, every hour of it to take

back one of your tears baby...My children

my best thing. You my best thing!

BELOVED

You're weren't nice to me..you didn't

smile at me..

SETHE

That's not true. I told you, I had to get

you out, make you safe...so's you and me

could be together on the other side,

forever..

DENVER

Ma'am...

BELOVED

LIAR!

DENVER

MAMA!

SETHE

Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go

on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.

DENVER

But mama..

SETHE

Go upstairs I said!!

BELOVED (OS)

I want somethin' sweet.

SETHE (OS)

We don't have nothing sweet no more,

baby.

BELOVED (OS)

Not for me, you don't! You don't let me

eat the pies...

SETHE (OS)

No. Since mama lost her job, we don't

have no more pies..

BABY SUGGS

You mean I never told you about your

daddy? About the Bodwins who let me rent

this here house while I do my shoe

repairing? About your mother's feet, not

to mention her back? I never told you all

that?

BABY SUGGS

Is that why you can't walk down the steps

and out yonder by yourself?

BABY SUGGS

Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and

learn your letters? You liked going there

I remember. Seeing the other children.

Then all a sudden, you stop.

DENVER

There was a boy there...said mama was a

jailbird...said he could prove it..

BABY SUGGS

My Jesus my...What people won't say. Why

didn't you come and ask me?

(Denver shrugs)

'Fraid I'll tell ya, huh?

(Denver looks at her)

Come here, child..

BABY SUGGS

You got to go sometime. You got to go out

there by yourself sometime.

DENVER

But you said...you said out there, there

ain't no...what was that word?..no..de-

fense. No de-fense.

BABY SUGGS

There ain't.

DENVER

Then what do I do?

BABY SUGGS

Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.

DENVER

Mama?

BELOVED

I look just like her.

DENVER

Mama let me help you.

SETHE

NO!...She wanted me to do it.

TWO BLACK MAN

Morning...Morning..

LADY JONES

Why Denver..Look at you.

LADY JONES

It's been so long. It's so nice of you to

come see me. What brings you?

LADY JONES

Well, never mind - nobody needs a reason

to visit. Let me make us some tea. Come

on.

LADY JONES

How's your family, honey?

DENVER

I want to work, Miss Lady.

LADY JONES

Work? Start learnin your letters again?

DENVER

No. I mean work work.

LADY JONES

Well, what can you do?

DENVER

I can't do anything but I would learn it

for you if you have a little extra.

LADY JONES

Extra?

DENVER

Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I

couldn't stay away from her too long,

cause of her condition but I could do

chores in the mornings.

LADY JONES

Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay

anybody anything for work they did

themselves...But if you all need to eat

until your mother's well, all you have to

do is say so...We have a church committee

invented so nobody had to go hungry.

DENVER

No..No that won't do...

BELOVED (OS)

RAAAIN!!! RAAAAIN!

SETHE

BABY!

DENVER

Thank you.

M. LUCILLE

WILLIAMS

Your welcome..

GRACE

No, darling. That's not my bowl. Mine's

got a blue ring around it..Would you like

to come in a spell?

SETHE

Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's

going be doing that..nobody going be

writing my daughter's characteristics on

the animal side..no sir..I don't

care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I

refuse..that's right..that's right...

DENVER

Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you

eat something.

SETHE

She likes this dress...

DENVER

But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there.

Come sit at the table.

DENVER

Please mama, eat something...

JANEY

Yes?

DENVER

May I come in?

JANEY

What you want?

DENVER

I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.

JANEY

Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister,

darlin.

DENVER

Oh.

JANEY

What you want'em for?

DENVER

I'm looking for work. I was thinking they

might know of some.

JANEY

(smiles)

You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?

DENVER

Yes ma'am.

JANEY

I heard your mother took sick, that so?

DENVER

Yes ma'am..

JANEY

Well, come on in. You letting in flies.

JANEY

You know what? I've been here since I was

fourteen and I remember like yesterday

when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat

right where you are. Whiteman name of

Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin

were good friends. That's how she got

that house you all live in. Other things

too.

DENVER

Yes ma'am.

JANEY

I never went to those woodland services

but she was always nice to me. Always.

Never be another like her.

DENVER

I miss her.

JANEY

Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was

a good woman...Well, I don't know whether

the Bodwins think it or not but they sure

could use some extra help.

DENVER

(hopeful)

Ya think?

JANEY

They getting older now and I can't take

care of 'em like I used to. More and more

they keep asking me to sleep over night.

Now, I don't want to quit these people

but they can't have all my days and

nights too. I got my own family needs me.

It'll take some convincing but maybe you

could come after supper - take care of

your mama during the day, then earn a

little something at night, how's that?

DENVER

Fine. But what would I do at night?

JANEY

Be here. In case.

DENVER

In case of what?

JANEY

In case the house burn down or bad

weather slops the roads so bad I can't

get here on time or late guests needed

cleaning up after. Anything.

(laughs)

Don't ask me what whitefolks need at

night.

DENVER

They good whitefolks?

JANEY

Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't

good. I wouldn't trade them for another

pair, tell you that. But you come back in

a few days - give me a chance to lead'em

to it. All right?

JANEY

What is it, child? What's the trouble

with Sethe?

GRACE

But is it really the daughter, Janey? The

killed one?

JANEY

That what she say.

M. LUCILLE

WILLIAMS

How they know it's her?

ELLA

It's sitting there. Sleeps, eats and

raises hell. Whipping Sethe every day.

GRACE

I'll be. A baby?

JANEY

No. Grown now. The age it would have been

had it lived.

GRACE

In the flesh. And whipping her.

M. LUCILLE

WILLIAMS

Guess she had it coming a little.

ELLA

Nobody got that coming.

M. LUCILLE

WILLIAMS

But Ella- you can't just up and kill your

children.

ELLA

No, and the children can't just up and

kill the mama. What's fair ain't

necessarily right...

(the women listen)

Now you all know how I felt about the

whole thing. I know the rage Sethe felt

in that shed that day.  We all do. But

what I could not understand, and still

don't, was her reaction to it. Prideful.

Too damn complicated for a black woman in

her position before God. But whatever she

done, I don't like the idea of past

errors taking possession of the present.

I don't cotton to sin moving in on a

house, unleashed and sassy. Every day

life takes enough, takes all a woman has.

"Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof"

and nobody needs more. Nobody needs a

grown up evil sitting at a table with a

grudge. As long as that ghost showed

itself from a ghostly place, I respected

it. But once it take on flesh and come

into this world, well, the shoe's on the

other foot now. I don't mind a little

communication between worlds. But this

here's an invasion.

GRACE

Should we pray?

ELLA

Uh-huh. First. Then we got to get down to

business.

DENVER

Mama?....Mama I'm going out..

(no response)

Mama, I got a job. Working over at the

Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over

now to pick me up on his way back from

town. I'll be staying there nights and

coming back here for the daytime. We'll

have some money, mama..Mama?

DENVER

I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give

up yet.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

SETHE

No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He

not taking my best thing...No..

SETHE

No...no...no..

DENVER

Mama?

SETHE

No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO!

DENVER

MAMA...NOOOOOOO!

FADE OUT;

DENVER

Good morning, Paul D.

PAUL

Well, is it now? How you getting along?

DENVER

Don't pay to complain.

PAUL

You on your way home?

DENVER

No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt

factory. Figure between that and my night

work at the Bodwins I might be able to

put something away for me and mama.

PAUL

They treating you right over at the

Bodwins?

DENVER

More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she

teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I

might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting

on me.

PAUL

Your mother all right?

DENVER

No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten

out of bed since that day.

PAUL

You think I should stop by? Think she'd

welcome it?

DENVER

I don't know. I think I've lost my

mother, Paul D.

PAUL

That girl...You know, Beloved...

DENVER

Yes?

PAUL

She gone like they say?

DENVER

Haven't seen her since that day. Ella

thinks she might be waiting in the woods

for another chance but..I don't think so.

Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she

can feel it.

PAUL

You think she sure 'nough your sister?

DENVER

At times. At other times I think she

was...more. But who would know that

better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough

you her.

PAUL

Well, if you want my opinion...

DENVER

I don't. I have my own.

PAUL

You grown.

DENVER

Yes sir

PAUL

Well, good luck with the job.

DENVER

Thank you.

DENVER

And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way,

but be careful how you talk to my mama,

hear?

PAUL

I will.

YOUNG MAN

Hey, Miss Denver..Wait up!

PAUL

Sethe?

SETHE

(turns to him)

Paul D.

PAUL

Aw, Sethe.

SETHE

You shaved.

PAUL

Yeah. Look bad?

SETHE

No, You looking good.

PAUL

Devil's confusion. What's this I hear

about you not getting out of bed?

(no response)

I saw Denver. She tell you?

SETHE

She comes in the daytime.  She still with

me, my Denver.

PAUL

(nervous)

You got to get up from here, girl.

SETHE

I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest

a while.

PAUL

(getting upset, shouts)

Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs

quilt. Is that what you planning!?

SETHE

Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at

all.

PAUL

Look - Denver be here in the day. I be

here in the night. I'm a take care of

you, you hear? Starting now.

PAUL

What, baby?

SETHE

(cries)

She left me. She's gone again.

PAUL

Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got

more yesterday than anybody. We need some

kind of tomorrow...

SETHE

She was my best thing.

PAUL

You your best thing, Sethe. You are.

SETHE

Me?...Me?

BABY SUGGS

..The only grace we can have, is the

grace we can imagine. If you cannot see

it, you will not have it...Here, in this

place, we are flesh. Flesh that weeps,

laughs, dances on bare feet in the grass.

Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not

love your flesh. They despise it. They

flay it. O, my people, they do not love

your hands. Those they only use, tie,

bind, chop off and leave empty, Love your

hands. Love them. Raise them up and kiss

them. Touch others with them, put them

together, stroke them on your face 'cause

they don't love that either. You  got to

love it. You. Yonder out there, they

ain't in love with your moth. They will

see it broken and break it again. What

you say out of it, they will not heed.

What you scream from it they do not hear.

No, they don't love your mother. You got

to love it. And the feet that need to

rest and to dance. The backs that needs

support. The shoulders that need arms,

strong arms I'm telling you! O my people,

out yonder they don't love your neck

unnoosed and straight. So love your neck;

put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and

hold it up. Love all your inside parts,

love 'em..and the beating heart, love

that too. More than eyes or feet. More

than lungs that have yet to draw free

air, love your heart. For this is the

prize.

FADE OUT.

THE END
