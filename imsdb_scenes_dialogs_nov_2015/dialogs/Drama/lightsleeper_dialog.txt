SHOOTING DRAFT

1992

LETOUR

(voice over)

Labor Day weekend. Some time for a

sanitation strike. Everybody crazy

to stock up. They decide to score at

the last minute and want it now.

Never fails. The faces look alike.

You gotta use memory tricks: each

has some peculiarity -- it keeps you

sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug

dealer starts writing a diary it's

time to quit. I started writing after

that. Not every night -- now and

then. Just to burn off the night.

Fill up one book, throw it out, start

another.

CUT TO:

ANN

Darling.

LETOUR

Ann.

ANN

Have we made New York safe for another

weekend?

LETOUR

(waves)

Robert.

ROBERT

Get a job.

LETOUR

(about ROBERT)

Sad what ten years without sex can

do.

ANN

Any hundreds?

LETOUR

Twenties -- and tens.

ROBERT

Tens!

ANN

Goddamn cash machines.

ROBERT

Did what's-his-name give you a hard

time?

LETOUR

(out of shot)

You mean --?

ROBERT

Yeah.

LETOUR

Cash Before Delivery.

(re-emerges)

CBD.

ROBERT

Fucking investment bankers.

ANN

These Wall Street kids deal with

fake money all day, they think cash

is a theoretical concept -- like it

doesn't apply. I see 'em at two,

shudder to think at nine they're

buying and selling -- turned me off

the stock market.

LETOUR

It's late.

(to ROBERT)

You staying?

ROBERT

It's over.

LETOUR

I'm gonna crash -- try, at least.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we

can all eat together. Go on. You

look tired. Here, take a couple of

C's. I'll pick up anything that comes

in.

ANN

Sleep tight.

ROBERT

Pick up the trash.

LETOUR

(laughs)

Yeah -- big kiss.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

(voice over)

"Labor Day." "Union Movement" --

there's a contradiction in terms. I

know about long hours. It's worse

when I'm off -- I just walk and walk.

Where am I going? There's an element

of providence to it all. Like rolling

numbers. Luck. You're walking down

the street, some guy that looks maybe

a little like you does a stick-up

four hours ago, there's an APB

description out and a cop pulls you

in cause he's cold and wants to go

inside -- they grab your stash. Your

number's up. You're busted for

nothing. For bad luck.

CUT TO:

JEALOUS

Are they "faced"?

LETOUR

Don't bore me.

JEALOUS

Is it so much work to face them the

same direction? You don't do it, I

got to. It's time -- my time --

LETOUR

(overlap)

Jees --

JEALOUS

We've been through all this.

(LETOUR shrugs)

This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.

LETOUR

We pay you more, you put up with

more. White drugs for white people.

Twice the price, twice the safety.

JEALOUS

I can't believe Ann's been working

as long as she has -- never busted.

She's something.

LETOUR

Never made any big money either.

JEALOUS

Sure.

LETOUR

She blows it.

JEALOUS

You believe that? What you gonna do

after she quits? How long you been

with her?

LETOUR

She always says that. We'll see,

Jealous.

JEALOUS

She's out. You should pick up her

trade. You're too old to be a go-

fer. They know you, they trust you.

LETOUR

No way. I'm not the management type.

I get in charge, I'll start using

again -- not for me. I know music

people. I'm gonna get in recording.

JEALOUS

Yeah.

JEALOUS

Tour.

LETOUR

What?

JEALOUS

Normally this wouldn't matter to

you, but you may get hassled.

LETOUR

Why?

JEALOUS

You read the papers? The Park murder.

All over the Post. Mariah Rangel --

nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch

dead in Turtle Pond coked to the

fucking gills. All of a sudden they're

hot after mid-level dealers. They're

buzzin'. You know her?

LETOUR

(shrugs)

I look like an encyclopedia? Who

knows?

(opens door)

Thanks for the warning.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

Jack.

ROBERT

You pick up from Jealous?

LETOUR

(passes bag)

Yeah, nineteen grams after four times

last night. We're certainly not his

favorite people.

ROBERT

We don't make the laws. Nineteen is

carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him

be stupid.

LETOUR

He took my hundreds.

ROBERT

(stands)

Take over for a while. I'm getting

contact high.

LETOUR

(sits)

Who's Her Majesty talking to?

ROBERT

The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona.

She's trying to get them to come

here -- or, better, Europe.

LETOUR

That's where the money is.

ROBERT

All mark-up -- the "Big One."

LETOUR

(laughs)

Don't dress.

(beat)

You really think she means it?

ROBERT

That's what she says. New Year's Eve

and out -- no Acid House, no product,

no deliveries.

LETOUR

That's just her mouth talking.

ROBERT

Next year -- strictly Akasha.

LETOUR

"Akasha"?

ROBERT

Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling

the company now --

LETOUR

(interjects)

-- this week. I don't get it --

marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd

anyone pay to put weeds on their

face?

ROBERT

Why'd anyone pay to put them up their

nose? I like cosmetics. I need

cosmetics. You should come in with

us.

LETOUR

You forget: she hasn't asked me.

ANN

(out of shot)

Johnny! Robert! Come here!

ANN

(open arms)

Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen

hundred Ex at thirty each and the

delivery's here.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

Whatja think?

LETOUR

Of what?

ANN

The face cream. Almond, marigold,

chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk"

formula. I remixed it.

LETOUR

(smells her)

Very nice.

ANN

Reminds me, if you get downtown stop

at Enhancements and pick up some

almond oil -- not the California.

(fishes menus from

desk)

What should we order?

LETOUR

How about Indian?

ANN

Darling, it's Saturday.

ROBERT

Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.

ANN'S VOICE

"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a

message, we'll get back to you --

sooner than you think."

ANN

(to ROBERT)

Answer that. He'll call back every

five minutes.

ROBERT

(walking)

The night begins.

ANN

"Ped Srilom"? -- it's Northeastern.

Duck.

LETOUR

(glancing)

I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk

Ob."

ROBERT

(out of shot from

phone)

Me too.

LETOUR

Use it for facial cream.

ROBERT

(out of shot)

Remove unsightly hair!

ANN

Laugh, one day you'll be watching me

on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.

LETOUR

Forgive us.

ROBERT

(returns)

Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top

Lady. God knows what happened to his

shit yesterday.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

You take it -- call in.

LETOUR

It was supposed to be light tonight.

ROBERT

Don't you watch TV?

LETOUR

Don't have one.

ROBERT

Well if you were the normal stupid

fuck you should be so lucky to be

and had one, you'd know it's supposed

to rain --

ANN

Good for the trees --

ROBERT

Some farmer whacked his numerology

on us.

ANN

(peers through curtain)

It's started.

ROBERT

The Farmer's Almanac is based on

numerology.

LETOUR

Raining?

ANN

Take a coat.

(to ROBERT)

And you, clean up the product before

the food delivery comes.

CUT TO:

EDDIE

Le Tour! -- finally. What took so

long?

LETOUR

(steps inside)

Traffic. It's raining.

EDDIE

How's things?

LETOUR

Okay.

EDDIE

I need a quarter -- you got it?

LETOUR

(nods)

Robert said he sold you a quarter

yesterday.

EDDIE

(slurs)

Some friends came over. How much is

that? Fourteen-hundred?

LETOUR

Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down.

I've known you, what, like eight

years?

EDDIE

(counting)

Yeah...

LETOUR

Knew you from the other job, the one

before the last one you fucked up. I

knew your wife -- remember her? We

used to sit and talk and talk --

EDDIE

(whining)

You don't know what she was like --

LETOUR

This is no good. I'll sell you a

gram and some downs, but I ain't

gonna put you in the emergency room.

Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.

EDDIE

(stands)

You charge $200 for what goes for

ninety on the street -- and you're

not gonna sell?

LETOUR

(clicks beeper)

So go to the street.

EDDIE

I'll call Ann.

LETOUR

Go ahead. You know what she'll say.

Phone's over there.

EDDIE

(irrational)

I'll tell the fucking cops.

LETOUR

(flashes cold)

Fuck you. That's it. You're out.

(turns to leave)

Don't call again. Catch you next

lifetime.

EDDIE

(contrite)

Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right.

I didn't mean that. I'm quitting

anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.

LETOUR

(turns back)

Okay.

EDDIE

Two hundred?

LETOUR

You got downs?

(EDDIE nods)

One more thing. I gotta use the phone.

MID-TWENTIESH MAN

(continuing)

...but -- if there's no God, how can

man conceive of him? The idea of God

presupposes the existence of God.

That's the Ontological Argument.

Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen

hundred -- I'm not sure --

LETOUR

(checks his watch)

I've got to go.

MID-TWENTIESH MAN

(gesturing)

Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of

God is implanted by God -- the sensus

divinitatus, the sense of the divine --

what is the role of human thought?

Not faith, thought...

LETOUR

(Voice over)

Everybody wants to talk. It's like a

compulsion. My philosophy is: you

got nothing to say, don't say it.

They figure you can tell a D.D.

anything, things they would never

tell anyone else. He understands. Of

course they're stoned to start. If I

could tie together all the hours of

coke talk I've heard, that would be

a lot of string. It was Robert's

idea to add twenty-five dollars to

home deliveries cause it's such a

hassle. Fifty is more like it.

FIRST STUDENT

C'mon, Tour, stick around.

SECOND STUDENT

Yeah.

FIRST STUDENT

There's only four of us and like

seven of them -- and we're paying

for the dope. See her, over there,

the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? --

she's gonna model for Elite.

LETOUR

(smiling)

Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me

like an old horse.

SECOND STUDENT

Shit, dude --

LETOUR

Nah. Thanks anyway.

(checks watch)

I gotta go. Have fun.

(heads toward exit)

CUT TO:

LETOUR

(to DRIVER)

Carlos. Wait a second.

LETOUR

Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll

give you a ride.

LETOUR

John. John LeTour.

MARIANNE

(recognizes him)

John?

LETOUR

Get in. You're getting soaked.

MARIANNE

(awkward)

Hi...

LETOUR

Where are you going?

LETOUR

I didn't know you still lived here.

MARIANNE

(second thoughts)

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

I should get out.

LETOUR

Don't be crazy. It's pouring.

MARIANNE

I'm not supposed to be around --

LETOUR

(completes sentence)

-- former drug associates.

MARIANNE

It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol,

no cigarettes, no nothing.

LETOUR

I heard. I'm happy for you.

MARIANNE

It's still not easy.

LETOUR

I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid

me. I'm straight -- two years. It

came that time. I tried to tell you.

I wrote. I called.

MARIANNE

(looks around)

I should get out.

LETOUR

Honest.

MARIANNE

But you're dealing.

LETOUR

No. I stopped.

MARIANNE

What's in the bag?

LETOUR

Almond oil. You can check.

(opens bag)

Look.

LETOUR

Shit.

MARIANNE

What's that for? In case someone

needs almond oil in the middle of

the night?

LETOUR

I still deal a little, but I'm

straight -- that part's true. Believe

me.

MARIANNE

(to DRIVER)

Stop here. Now. Stop!

LETOUR

I won't say anything. I promise.

I'll just sit here. I'll just give

you a ride.

MARIANNE

Goodbye, John.

LETOUR

Where do you live?

(door slams)

Mari...

DRIVER

Sir?

LETOUR

Eighty-third Street.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TERESA

(out of shot)

Coffee?

LETOUR

(out of shot)

Thanks.

TERESA

(out of shot)

Black?

LETOUR

(out of shot)

Yeah.

TERESA

(out of shot)

Here.

LETOUR

I'm not sure how this works.

TERESA

Have you ever been to a psychic

before?

LETOUR

No, but I've, well, I've heard about

it.

TERESA

Do you need advice? John?

LETOUR

(nods)

No... it's not that... I don't know --

I just decided to come. I thought...

TERESA

Be comfortable.

(smile)

How did you hear about me?

LETOUR

A recommendation. Somebody from work.

Two hundred dollars, right?

TERESA

It's a lot of money?

LETOUR

I don't care.

TERESA

(explaining)

I look at you. I give you my

impressions. I feel your "vibrations" --

I don't like that word, it sounds

phony, but I can't think of anything

better.

(watching)

You're anxious.

(he shrugs)

More than usual. Your aura is very

strong. I feel a very strong vibration

from you. A change is coming. You're

worried about money. You say you

don't care about money but that's

not true.

LETOUR

Yeah.

TERESA

Your livelihood is endangered. You're

worried about the future. You don't

have much money saved. What will you

do?

LETOUR

I don't know.

TERESA

I see a woman who has betrayed you.

LETOUR

(smiles)

My mother?

TERESA

(cuts him short)

Who will betray you.

LETOUR

Not... I...

TERESA

Keep it in mind. I have a strong

feeling about this woman, a woman

close to you, she will betray you.

You're in the entertainment business,

aren't you?

LETOUR

Yes.

TERESA

But you're not happy. You want to do

something else. Is it music?

LETOUR

Yes...

TERESA

You have a talent for music.

LETOUR

As a child.

TERESA

You still have it. It's strong. I

see music in your future. A career

opportunity will come in the music

field. Take it. It won't seem

promising. Take it anyway.

(pause)

You're full of stress. Are you

exercising?

LETOUR

No. I --

TERESA

You should exercise more. You must

let go of this stress. It's not good

for your health. I'm not saying you're

going over to the other side, but

it's not good for you. You're still

drinking, aren't you? You have a

drinking problem?

(he shrugs)

It's interfering with your health

and your life too. You've had other

problems. Drug addiction.

LETOUR

Yes.

TERESA

This was very important in your life.

LETOUR

Yes.

TERESA

You are in the balance. Everything

you do -- positive or negative -- in

this life is a drop that will carry

over in the next. Every act, every

decision matters.

LETOUR

Teresa?

TERESA

What is it?

LETOUR

I'm thirty-eight years old.

(beat)

Forty.

TERESA

You're young.

LETOUR

I have trouble sleeping.

(TERESA waits)

Look. What do you see around me? Is

there anything? Is it dark? Have I

run out of luck? Is there luck?

TERESA

I see a glow. Everything you need is

around you. The only danger is inside

you.

CUT TO:

ANN

(to LETOUR and ROBERT)

Your pay's on the table.

YOUNG HASID

(dialogue punctuates

action)

One hundred thirty-one, let's make

it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small

bills. One percent commission, $130

to you -- add tens or whatever if

you want.

YOUNG HASID

Same time?

ANN

(nods)

Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while.

We'll order kosher. We'll tell you

dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.

YOUNG HASID

(passes hundreds)

I'm late already. I only come 'cause

I like you. Sure you're not Jewish?

I don't want to see you hurt. Find a

man. You should do something else.

ANN

(offers commission)

Invest in my cosmetics line.

YOUNG HASID

(takes money)

Don't mix business with friendship.

YOUNG HASID

Shalom.

ANN

Shalom.

(opens door)

See you next week.

(calls after him)

Don't eat any hot dogs!

LETOUR

Jealous said something about a yuppie

murder in the Park. You know anything

about it?

ANN

It's all over the news.

LETOUR

Jealous said to be careful.

ANN

We are careful.

ROBERT

(returning)

We're too small time. Besides, she

wasn't one of ours -- not directly.

(to LETOUR)

Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants

somebody over right away. Second

floor waiting room.

LETOUR

A hospital? What's he doing there?

ROBERT

He says he needs you to come to St.

Luke's. I'd go but I got the other

thing.

LETOUR

The --?

ROBERT

Yeah.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

Go. Keep on his good side. He set up

Arizona.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

Let's have lunch. Tomorrow.

LETOUR

Me?

ANN

One o'clock. Cote Basque. Is that

too early?

LETOUR

No. Yeah -- sure.

ROBERT

Tonight?

LETOUR

I vote Japanese.

ANN

Fine.

ROBERT

Okay.

LETOUR

(heads for door)

Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

What's going on?

TIS

You got some valiums?

LETOUR

(nods)

-- 'n 'ludes.

TIS

Just a valium -- a ten.

LETOUR

What is it?

TIS

You won't believe it. What a

nightmare. I brought in this chick.

She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even

know her. I didn't have to bring her

in. The cops are coming back to talk

to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down.

LETOUR

(hands him valium)

Here.

TIS

Make it two.

TIS

Thanks.

LETOUR

She okay?

TIS

Who?

LETOUR

The girl.

TIS

Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A

walking vacuum cleaner. What a

nightmare. Underage.

LETOUR

You need a lawyer?

TIS

(gestures toward suited

man)

He's here. Thanks.

LETOUR

Any time.

RANDI

John!

LETOUR

Randi?

RANDI

(kisses him)

I can't believe it. Marianne's here

too. She flew in. It's been so long.

You look great.

LETOUR

(deactivates beeper)

You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why

are you here?

RANDI

Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne

tell you?

LETOUR

Serious?

RANDI

(nods)

More chemo.

LETOUR

Can I see her?

RANDI

She's sleeping. She sleeps most of

the time. She'd like it, though. She

still talks about you.

LETOUR

(sad)

I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman.

I was crazy about her. God.

RANDI

It's John. What a coincidence.

MARIANNE

(gathering herself)

Yes.

(extends hand)

Hi.

LETOUR

(shakes hand)

Randi told me about your mom. I'm

sorry.

MARIANNE

Thanks.

LETOUR

She's sedated?

MARIANNE

Yeah.

RANDI

She would be so happy to see John.

MARIANNE

I don't think that would be a good

idea.

LETOUR

You both look so tired.

MARIANNE

One of us has to be here.

RANDI

The hospital lets us stay in her

room.

LETOUR

Let me buy you some coffee or

something -- the cafeteria's

downstairs. It helps to talk.

RANDI

You go, Marianne, it's my turn with

mom.

MARIANNE

I shouldn't.

RANDI

Go. You haven't eaten. Go on.

(nudges her)

Go on.

MARIANNE

I...

RANDI

Bring me a coffee.

LETOUR

This way.

(to RANDI)

Kiss your mother for me.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

I like your mom.

MARIANNE

She liked you. You know this will

happen someday, but when it does...

Your mother -- that was a shock.

LETOUR

(re: Marianne's mother)

She's been sick a while?

MARIANNE

A year.

LETOUR

Your father?

MARIANNE

("no")

Not this time. His new wife -- he'll

make it to the funeral.

LETOUR

What have you been doing? Where do

you live?

MARIANNE

It's...

(deciding)

I don't want you to know about my

life.

LETOUR

Anything? You married? Have children?

A dog?

(smile)

House plants?

MARIANNE

Details just open the door.

LETOUR

The door to what?

(no answer)

It's not like we're strangers. We

were married.

MARIANNE

We were not.

LETOUR

There was a ceremony.

MARIANNE

He wasn't even a minister. He was an

astrologer.

LETOUR

He was also a minister. "Universal

Harmony."

MARIANNE

He was a Pisces.

LETOUR

You're a Pisces.

MARIANNE

It was not legal.

LETOUR

In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're

still --

MARIANNE

I was on the cusp.

LETOUR

We were happy.

MARIANNE

We were miserable. We were either

scoring or coming down -- mostly

coming down.

LETOUR

There were good times. Area, out on

the street, laughing, dancing with

friends -- we were magical.

MARIANNE

You took off for three months without

telling me and called once. That's

how magical we were. You were an

encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies --

I heard them all. Nobody could clear

a room like you, John. And the

friends, you may have noticed, turned

out to be mine, not yours. I envy

you. A convenient memory is a gift

from God.

LETOUR

You exaggerate.

MARIANNE

In rehab they call this "euphoric

recall." You only remember the highs,

never the lows.

LETOUR

We were happy.

MARIANNE

I was drowning.

LETOUR

It wasn't me --

MARIANNE

You watched --

LETOUR

You jumped --

MARIANNE

You did nothing -- "It wasn't your

business, you weren't responsible" --

you still think like that.

(shakes head)

Actions have consequences; so do --

LETOUR

(overlap)

I --

MARIANNE

-- inactions.

LETOUR

I didn't --

(MARIANNE smiles)

I meant well.

MARIANNE

You always meant well.

LETOUR

We were in love?

MARIANNE

Yes.

LETOUR

We were happy?

LETOUR

You bought it for me. It's inscribed

inside.

LETOUR

Ann's quitting. I've got to find

something else to do.

MARIANNE

Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.

LETOUR

It's true.

MARIANNE

Are you really straight?

LETOUR

Yeah.

MARIANNE

Let me see your eyes.

MARIANNE

Eyes are deceiving.

(beat)

Congratulations.

LETOUR

If I could do that, I could do

anything.

MARIANNE

What do you mean?

LETOUR

We could do anything. We could start

over.

MARIANNE

(bangs her head)

What was that? I think I heard

something.

LETOUR

I'm serious.

MARIANNE

You're crazy.

LETOUR

(gestures to room)

This is crazy.

MARIANNE

I have to get back.

LETOUR

I'll walk you.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

(voice over)

I can always find another way to

make a living. I never planned this

in the first place -- not like Ann.

She came up to sell, have parties,

make contacts. She was so glamorous.

I just wanted to be around her. She'd

sit up listening to coke stories.

Now it's me and Robert. The whole

crowd was the same age. Everybody's

younger now. She made me.

CUT TO:

ANN

You have any money saved?

LETOUR

There's some. Not much. A thousand

or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.

ANN

What do you do with your money?

LETOUR

I don't know. It's not that much in

the first place -- as you know.

ANN

(counterpoint)

It's tax free --

LETOUR

Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs --

what about your money?

ANN

Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the

only person I know that lives as

well as you is my grandmother." All

the money I've made, all the money

I've spent -- it never adds up. This

last two years cosmetics' been taking

everything.

LETOUR

I wish I could help.

ANN

You still go to meetings?

LETOUR

No, but I'm okay. What are the odds

of meeting someone you haven't seen

in years twice in two days?

ANN

Ask Robert to make up a chart for

you; the other person -- who is it?

LETOUR

Just a contact -- you don't know

him.

ANN

What's the plan?

LETOUR

The plan?

ANN

What you gonna do?

LETOUR

My future?

ANN

Too conceptual?

LETOUR

We had this conversation two years

ago. We'll have it two years from

now.

ANN

This time it's for real.

LETOUR

(accepting premise)

I'm thinking of some music courses.

Mixing, sound editing --

ANN

You took that before.

LETOUR

That was acting.

ANN

(corrects him)

Modeling.

LETOUR

Why all this concern? Suddenly you

care?

ANN

I have feelings too -- you may have

noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm

tough, you gotta to be tough,

especially in this business, it's

one thing to act tough -- I've seen

Zipporah twice this week.

LETOUR

She helps you?

ANN

(nods)

-- harmonizes, she's encouraging me

to get out of this into the cosmetics

thing --

ANN

(about CUSTOMER)

Nomination for Best Picture. I knew

every girl he fucked -- how, why. I

knew when he had trouble shitting.

Like this.

(crosses fingers)

His wife says he gets straight or

she cuts him off. Old money. I

remember the last thing he said to

me: "See you soon." Yeah, sure. That

was five years ago.

ANN

(vulnerable)

You'll still talk to me, won't you?

LETOUR

You --?

(to ANN)

Of course I will.

ANN

It'll be strange without you around.

I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.

LETOUR

(clever)

We'll always have Paris.

ANN

(reproachful)

John.

LETOUR

Ann, you want me, call, write a

letter, tell a wino -- I'll be there.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

(soft)

I'm sorry. I...

LETOUR

(after a moment)

I always thought my father would die

first. He would die, then my mother

and I would reconcile. Just her and

me. I hated him for living.

MARIANNE

It's like a joke. It's not a real

feeling. It's like a feeling of a

feeling.

LETOUR

My old man bawling in the hospital,

me popping in and out of the john

getting loaded.

(beat)

I miss you.

MARIANNE

You tried to kill me. You took ten

years of my life one way or another.

(he kisses her)

I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too

busy hating you.

LETOUR

I thought I was just killing myself.

LETOUR

Selfish.

MARIANNE

I remember.

LETOUR

What?

MARIANNE

What it felt like.

(kisses his face)

What this tasted like.

LETOUR

I see you and my heart starts

thumping.

MARIANNE

John.

LETOUR

Excuse us.

(to MARIANNE)

Let's go.

MARIANNE

Come. Come with me.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

Have you ever had sex totally

straight?

MARIANNE

Not with you.

LETOUR

Neither have I.

MARIANNE

Such an erection.

LETOUR

Never had anything like it stoned.

Feel it.

(she does)

MARIANNE

Weird.

LETOUR

(caresses erection)

Wow.

MARIANNE

I'm dripping.

LETOUR

Let's disappear.

LETOUR

Kiss, kiss, kiss.

MARIANNE

Kiss, kiss, kiss.

LETOUR

Together.

LETOUR

(waking)

You need to go back?

MARIANNE

This is the end. It was wonderful.

I'm glad it happened this way. It

will never happen again. You will

not see me, you will not call me

again. I'm happy for you. I wish you

the best. I'm leaving. I'm going

back to the hospital. I shouldn't

have left -- but I don't regret it.

Please dress and leave as soon as

possible. I have a key. Goodbye.

LETOUR

Marianne...

MARIANNE

It's my fault.

LETOUR

I love you.

CUT TO:

ANN

Johnny, what is this? Your beeper

broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two

hours: where have you bee?

LETOUR

There was a mix-up --

ANN

How you gonna survive on your own?

The U.N.'s got some conference in

two days. The holiday's over --

ragheads everywhere trying to score.

U.N. security at every hotel -- little

creeps with lapel pins. Even I've

been out. This is where our money

is: Europe, Asia, not the streets --

you wouldn't know crack from

crackerjacks.

LETOUR

Where's Robert?

ANN

Busting his ass. He's out doing your

job.

LETOUR

It was a confusion.

ANN

Get confused on your day off.

LETOUR

When is that?

ANN

Don't get wise. What do you want me

to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A

raise? No way. Get out there. There's

a list on the TV. I love you. Get

your ass outta here before I kiss

it.

LETOUR

(pecks her cheek)

I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.

CUT TO:

TIS

Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this

is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas.

They're here for a show.

LETOUR

Enchante.

(to TIS)

How'd it turn out?

TIS

(to GABRI)

Questo e un vero Americano.

(to LETOUR)

What?

LETOUR

St. Luke's.

TIS

No problem, but -- can you believe

this? -- she's out of the hospital

in one day, calls me up, wants to

"get together." Some people are just

born for losing. Want to go in back?

LETOUR

Not now.

TIS

Huh?

LETOUR

Look at the bar. Black-haired guy,

late twenties, brown suit, drinking

tonic?

(TIS nods)

He's casing you. Not me, you.

Undercover, whatever -- he's on you.

TIS

You know him?

LETOUR

(shakes head "no")

Just a feeling. You holding?

TIS

No. Need help?

LETOUR

("no")

Leave a message. Robert or I will

come by later.

TIS

Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.

(to MODELS)

Who am I trying to impress?

(they smile

uncomprehendingly)

Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three-

quarters.

LETOUR

Nineteen is the top. I'll make two

trips.

TIS

Nineteen is fine.

LETOUR

(leaving)

A domani. Take care, girls.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

(voice over)

I feel my life turning. All it needed

was a direction. You drift from day

to day, years go by. Suddenly there

is a direction. What a strange thing

to happen halfway through your life.

HOTEL SWITCHBOARD

Thank you.

MEDICAL VOICE

You're welcome.

CUT TO:

LETOUR

Can I help you, officer?

GUIDONE

What?

LETOUR

I hope I haven't made a mistake. You

are a cop, aren't you?

GUIDONE

Yes.

LETOUR

Could I see a badge?

GUIDONE

(shows credentials)

Bill Guidone.

LETOUR

What is it?

GUIDONE

You think you're invisible, don't

you? You think we don't know you,

LeTour -- that's the name you use,

right?

LETOUR

My father's a partner in a powerful

law firm. If you have anything in

mind, do it by the book.

GUIDONE

(in his face)

You? Who the fuck cares about you? I

could grind you right here! -- maybe

I will! -- and nobody would give a

fuck! You're not worth the paperwork.

I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide --

I'm investigating the Park murder.

LETOUR

(acquiescent)

I don't follow the news.

GUIDONE

Downtown's interested how a Barnard

honors student with fancy parents

got a quarter of uncut coke on her

when she was murdered. I mean, we

just don't see this girl cruising

Alphabet City trying to score.

Somebody sold her, somebody upscale

and classy -- you're classy, I hear --

and that somebody knows something we

need to know.

(hand inside LeTour's

shirt, pinching his

tit)

Delivery boy!

LETOUR

I wish I could help. I don't even

know who's president.

GUIDONE

Let me put it this way. Here's my

card

(hands card)

Ask around, take a week or so. Call

me. Tell me something I don't know.

Either that, leave town, or get your

ass busted day in, day out.

CUT TO:

MARIANNE

Get out.

LETOUR

Marianne...

MARIANNE

(emotion rising)

Every time you come into my life

something terrible happens. I thought

I was rid of you. How'd you get here?

I don't want you here! I don't want

you around me, I don't want you around

my mother! Damn you!

LETOUR

Marianne...

MARIANNE

(wild)

Get out!

LETOUR

I didn't...

RANDI

I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You

shouldn't have come. Marianne has

been up all night, crying and crying.

She wasn't there when Mother passed --

died -- she blames herself. It

wouldn't have made any difference.

She just slipped away. Marianne's --

I'm worried --

LETOUR

It's...

RANDI

Don't try.

LETOUR

How are you?

RANDI

Me?

LETOUR

Yes, you. I can't think of anything,

but if there was anything I could

do...

RANDI

Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean,

we've been expecting it. It'll hit

me later.

LETOUR

I saw her.

RANDI

Who?

LETOUR

Your mother. I came in the room. You

were sleeping. I just watched.

RANDI

Oh.

(beat)

I'd better get back. Marianne's

probably flipping out.

CUT TO:

ANN

Have some shu mai. Just delivered.

LETOUR

No.

ROBERT

(entering)

I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis

called. He said before ten. He said

you were right.

ANN

About what?

LETOUR

An undercover cop. Not a narc. The

Park murder. Jealous was straight on

that -- you hear anything?

ROBERT

Remember the time that cop called

here? Wanted to know if we had "nose

candy"?

(laughs)

Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?"

ANN

What's wrong baby? You like like

shit. Something wrong?

(holds his face)

LETOUR

No.

ANN

You can't fool me. I can read you.

LETOUR

(distressed)

What do you care? You're leaving me.

A few more months -- sayonara.

(to ROBERT)

You too. John who? What was his name

again? Le --?

(to ANN: pained)

I mean it's not exactly like I got a

pension plan.

ROBERT

(hurt)

Jack.

ANN

(takes his hands)

Johnny, it's not that at all. Is

that what you think? You hate

cosmetics. You don't care about it.

You told me that.

LETOUR

I know.

ANN

Who knows what will happen?

ROBERT

I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into

lapidary. I'll introduce you. You

have to pass a test.

LETOUR

Lapi --?

ROBERT

Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds.

LETOUR

Any more about the Park murder?

ANN

(re: murder)

What's with this thing?

ROBERT

Stay away.

ANN

(genuine)

You want in? We'll make a place for

you.

LETOUR

No.

ANN

It's --

EDDIE

(out of shot --

answering machine)

"Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come.

The other thing is over. I'll be

home all night. 749-2876."

ROBERT

Shit.

ANN

(unequivocal)

Don't answer it. Let him call all

night. He's trouble. I don't want to

deal with him.

LETOUR

It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle

it.

ROBERT

I'm sorry if --

ANN

(about EDDIE)

He gives you shit -- fuck him.

LETOUR

(to ROBERT)

Forget it.

ROBERT

We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I

mean we're on a roll --

ANN

Spring roll.

LETOUR

(preparing to leave)

Sure, whatever. Surprise me.

CUT TO:

EDDIE

(on floor)

You gotta get permission? Check with

Mama?

LETOUR

I'm calling your brother.

EDDIE

Huh?

LETOUR

Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm

gonna ask him to come over.

(EDDIE protests)

You've told me so much about him.

EDDIE

(panicked)

No, don't. Please, I'll give you

money, anything. He doesn't

understand. Whose side are you on?

LETOUR

(on phone)

Is this Martin Jeer?

(beat)

Thank you.

EDDIE

I shoulda never called.

LETOUR

(to EDDIE)

I recommend Hazelden. It has the

best all-around program.

(on phone)

Martin Jeer?

(beat)

I'm here with your brother Ed.

(beat)

Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's

a medical emergency. You're going to

have to come.

LETOUR

(on phone)

He'll be here.

CUT TO:

TIS

Tour, just in time. We were out.

Nineteen, right?

LETOUR

Thirty-eight hundred -- got any

hundreds?

TIS

Some, not the whole thing.

(to THOMAS)

You got hundreds?

THOMAS

No.

TIS

I like that about Ann. Always takes

the time to grind it. If you do it,

do it right.

TIS

(to MARIANNE)

Looks like you could use some help.

(MARIANNE looks up,

sees JOHN, goes pale)

Mari, this is Tour. You got any

hundreds?

TIS

Not the talkative type. Haven't seen

her in years. You know her, don't

you?

(no answer. TIS counts

the money, offers

it. LETOUR is frozen)

Why they call me? What a nightmare.

(extending money)

You want it or not?

LETOUR

(vacant)

Yeah.

TIS

See you later.

FEMALE COP

Get back!

MALE COP

Who saw it? What happened?

EMS is on the way.

FEMALE COP

Too late --

CARLOS

Where to?

LETOUR

What?

CARLOS

Where to, sir? Where are we going?

LETOUR

Nowhere just now. Wait.

You want me to wait here?

LETOUR

Yes.

Downtown.

CARLOS

Yes.

This story is just in. A woman has

fallen thirty stories to her death

from a posh Grace Towers apartment

on Lexington Avenue. Police are

withholding identification pending

the notification of the next of kin.

The incident happened about ten p.m.

According to the sources on the scene

there was no one else in the posh

Grace Towers apartment when the fall

occurred. We will bring you more

details as we get them.

An end to the sanitation strike seems

Call. Make an appointment.

LETOUR

Open the door. You're awake anyway.

Teresa.

Read me. What do you see?

TERESA

Do I know you?

LETOUR

We had a session last week. What do

you see?

TERESA

(remembering name)

John?

LETOUR

Yes. Look at me.

TERESA

Step back.

(he does)

Again.

(he does)

Death.

LETOUR

Someone I knew died tonight.

TERESA

This was not an accident. This person

was murdered.

LETOUR

Am I in danger?

TERESA

(beat)

There is danger around you. It's

very close. I'm sleepy.

LETOUR

What should I do?

TERESA

I can't see it.

LETOUR

Please.

Am I lucky?

TERESA

Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.

Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.

Laundromat. Your father's got

You said I should ask around, tell

GUIDONE

I thought you'd call.

It ain't much, but it's something.

GUIDONE

Go on.

LETOUR

A girl died last night. Lexington

Ave.

GUIDONE

(out of shot)

The jumper. Druggie.

LETOUR

The news said she was alone in the

apartment when she went out -- she

wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was

someone else.

GUIDONE

(out of shot)

Who?

LETOUR

Who lives in the apartment?

GUIDONE

(out of shot)

You there?

LETOUR

That's all I know. You asked me to

tell you something. I told you

something.

CUT TO:

ROBERT

(out of shot)

Who is it?

LETOUR

Jack. Let me in.

ROBERT

Where have you been? We were worried.

LETOUR

I need some sleep -- not much. I

don't want to go home just yet. A

little sleep first. Can I crash here?

Nice place.

ROBERT

It's hideous. I did it years ago.

I've got to throw everything out.

You haven't been here?

(noticing TONY)

Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you

about him. You should talk. He's the

lapidopterist -- gems.

TONY

(corrects him)

Lapidarian.

ROBERT

Same thing.

LETOUR

Can I?

ROBERT

Sure.

LETOUR

What do you know about Tis? What's

his relationship to Ann?

ROBERT

They go way back -- before me. Did

you cross him?

LETOUR

No.

ROBERT

Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection.

She needs that score. What happened?

LETOUR

Nothing.

ROBERT

Don't mess with him.

LETOUR

Is he dangerous?

ROBERT

Everybody's dangerous. We heard what

you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was

great. She was afraid that was why

you didn't come back.

LETOUR

It was something else. Tell me if

you hear anything.

ROBERT

About what?

LETOUR

Tis.

ROBERT

Tis who? Ann says you want a chart

done.

(beat)

What's wrong?

LETOUR

(internal)

Ah...

ROBERT

(sympathetic)

You down?

LETOUR

(nods)

Yeah...

(culling thoughts)

You ever think about it?

ROBERT

What?

LETOUR

That it'd be like this -- like, your

life, you... that it would turn out

this way? --

ROBERT

Compared to what? My thinking this

or that is going to make any

difference? There's a plan unfolding.

"Will my plane crash?" "Does life

have meaning?" -- why ask me?

Thinking's a fear of living, negative

living; living's something else.

You're afraid. Let the plan unfold.

Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --

LETOUR

-- Robert --

ROBERT

-- day at a time.

LETOUR

(touches ROBERT)

You've lost your fucking brain.

ROBERT

I'm a drug dealer.

LETOUR

Got a tub?

Yeah.

Great.

There's a plastic bottle of bath oil

LETOUR

I don't have much use for a gun.

Never used one like this.

MANUEL

(translates for

DOMINICAN)

Cono!

LETOUR

What do you do?

MANUEL

Simple. You put the bullets in --

you point it at the bad guys, pull

MANUEL

Vaya con Dios.

RANDI

She was back on drugs. Really back.

They're gonna bring her here too. My

God.

I thought she was playing for

attention.

LETOUR

I didn't know.

RANDI

You're not to blame. Don't blame

yourself. You weren't responsible.

She was always -- she loved you.

LETOUR

(wipes tear from her

cheek)

She loved you. You were what she

wanted to be.

RANDI

She scared me.

LETOUR

Look. Do you recognize anyone?

RANDI

Tis.

LETOUR

You know him?

RANDI

His father's a lawyer. Did some tax

things for Mom. He was at the

hospital. What's that smell?

LETOUR

It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for

that cheap airplane stuff. Did

Marianne mention him yesterday?

RANDI

("no")

It was his apartment. What are you

thinking?

LETOUR

I don't know.

RANDI

She jumped.

(LETOUR hangs on every

word)

You loved her, but she -- this sounds

terrible but it's true -- she was...

she ruined everything... bad luck.

LETOUR

(heard enough)

When's the funeral -- your mother's?

RANDI

Tomorrow. Will you come?

LETOUR

Well, I got this thing to do. It's --

I don't know if I can get away.

T.C.T.E.

"Too Complicated To Explain."

LETOUR

(enters bedroom)

I'm $500 short from last night. I'll

get it, you can take it from my

salary.

ANN

(stung)

This is family. Are you saying that

to hurt me?

(LETOUR returns)

It's not money.

LETOUR

(chagrined)

Sorry.

ROBERT

Look at this.

("Akasha" visual)

We had a graphic artist make it up --

you know, Billy, Five Towns.

ANN

The label for the cosmetics line.

LETOUR

(examines it)

Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu...

ANN

(corrects him)

Kathmandu.

LETOUR

I love it.

ROBERT

Tis called twice. He wants you to

come by.

LETOUR

(wary)

Me?

ANN

Yeah. Says you were supposed to show

up again yesterday, but didn't.

LETOUR

A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide

and all. Let's stay away.

ANN

Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No

way I can fuck this.

LETOUR

C'mon...

ANN

This is business.

LETOUR

Let Robert go.

ANN

Tis won't deal with fags.

LETOUR

Since when?

ANN

Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's

new? So's everybody else.

LETOUR

I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.

ROBERT

He said you.

ANN

(to LETOUR)

Why?

LETOUR

(to ANN)

Why don't you go? He's your contact.

ROBERT

He is --

ANN

(to ROBERT)

You giving orders?

ROBERT

(deferential)

No, Missy.

LETOUR

(testing her)

Come with me -- the two of us.

ANN

(upbeat)

Okay. You got it. Like old times --

Ann and Johnny.

(turns to go)

LETOUR

Okay.

ROBERT

Stop it. You're breaking my heart.

CUT TO:

ANN

It's going to be strange, not doing

this. I mean I've had it, but

sometimes...

LETOUR

You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're

gonna quit.

ANN

(nods)

I think so. Seal this thing with

Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics.

You gotta take a chance in life. No

risk, no gain. I've already got retail

connections here, London. It was

great at the beginning, though.

LETOUR

When?

ANN

You know, when we first started out

of the place on Greene Street. Before

deliveries, when you were still using.

It was open house every night but

Sunday. We had everything: uppers,

downers, meth, six kinds of hash,

all in that trousseau, remember? You

could get in for a gram, stay all

night -- everybody, music people,

movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even

politics. I think like five marriages

came out of those parties, babies --

really. God.

(JOHN eyes her: why

this Niagara, this

nostalgia?)

You stayed, you then Robert -- but

he... I'da never thought you'd, what

is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a

year max, eight months, in, out,

start using, unreliable -- nice kids.

Remember when you first came: long

hair, dirty fingers --

LETOUR

(overlapping)

You made me --

ANN

-- never washed --

LETOUR

-- khaki pants.

ANN

I should write a book someday. Did

you know somebody wanted to do my

story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible,

of course -- my lawyer freaked I

even had the meeting. People envy

me. They think my life is so

glamorous, but they don't know. I

know. Glamorous.

(beat)

It was for a while. Then came crack

and fucked everything.

LETOUR

I gotta stop home a second.

ANN

Why? It's out of the way. They're

expecting you.

LETOUR

You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.

ANN

(unconvincing)

Chill. This is routine.

LETOUR

I want to get my lucky jacket.

ANN

Oh. Okay.

ANN

That took long enough. What did you

do, douche while you were at it?

LETOUR

Ann, you got some mouth on you.

ANN

You don't want to know where it's

been.

(sniffs him)

Cologne?

LETOUR

For you.

ANN

Phew. It smells like that stuff they

give you on airplanes. It's no good

for your skin. All chemicals.

ANN

What's that?

LETOUR

Do me a favor.

ANN

What?

LETOUR

Don't ask why, just promise.

ANN

What is it?

LETOUR

(testing again)

If anything happens to me -- if I

should like, you know, fucking die --

write and tell her.

LETOUR

It's my sister. Her husband's in San

Quentin. She worries, you know.

ANN

(eye contact)

Okay.

LETOUR

I thought we were going to Tis'?

ANN

We are. He's here. He can't very

well work out of his apartment after

what happened yesterday, can he?

CUT TO:

ANN

(on phone)

Mathis Bruge, please.

(beat)

Tis? Ann. I'm here with Tour.

(beat)

Okay.

(hangs up)

LETOUR

Tis there?

ANN

Twelve-oh-four.

LETOUR

(Jesus-to-Judas)

Ann.

ANN

I told you greasy fucks I don't deal

with guns! I see guns, I walk! How

dare you?

ANN

And you, beaner, whoever the fuck

you are, kiss my fat ass!

(she spits on his

shirt, knees him in

the crotch, yanks

his gun, throws it

beside the gut-

clutching CUBAN. She

crosses the room,

YELLING:)

That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know

you're fucking there! Let this be a

lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna

apologize for this!

(to LETOUR)

Let's go.

THOMAS

(pointing gun)

Hold it! Stop right there.

TIS

(to THOMAS)

No!

(to ANN)

Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I

was just trying to make a point -- I

apologize.

TIS

(about THOMAS and

CUBAN)

Assholes. What a nightmare.

(to ANN)

We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same

terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave,

you're upset. I just need to talk to

Tour a second. About a police matter.

(to LETOUR)

Right?

LETOUR

(to ANN)

Go on.

TIS

Tour and I need to get our stories

straight. Somebody's talking to the

police. The guns were for emphasis,

to make a point, dumb --

ANN

(to TIS)

We came together, we're leaving

together.

(to LETOUR)

Johnny, come with me.

TIS

(a command)

Thomas.

TIS

(to ANN)

Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave.

(to LETOUR)

I had nothing to do with Marianne --

she jumped: she was there, then she

was gone.

(nods ANN to leave)

Nothing will happen to Tour.

ANN

(out of shot)

Fire! Fire! Fire!

TIS

(desperate)

I didn't --

FADE OUT:

LETOUR

Hello.

ANN

Hi.

LETOUR

Twenty minutes. You look terrific.

ANN

I look respectable. Any news?

LETOUR

Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed

to be. Because of the extenuating

circumstances -- our cooperation --

they say it won't be more than five

years -- maybe seven. With time

served, good behavior, parole, I

could be out in two years -- maybe.

I hope.

ANN

It feels like forever.

LETOUR

It's not so bad. It's a relief in a

way -- at least so far. I've been

writing, reading.

ANN

I love your letters.

(pause)

LETOUR

How's business?

ANN

Robert quit. He went back to dealing.

I think he thought it would be less

work, more money. It's lucky in a

way I got mixed up in it -- now I

have to see this thing through. So

it's cosmetics after all.

LETOUR

(affectionate)

I miss you.

ANN

Me too.

LETOUR

Did we ever fuck?

ANN

What do you mean?

LETOUR

You know, make love.

ANN

(thinks)

There was that party when everybody

was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that

night you came over and crashed and

we slept together.

LETOUR

We were naked, but did we --?

ANN

You had a hard-on...

LETOUR

I didn't --

ANN

You tried...

LETOUR

I was thinking about it and I realized

we never really did. It's one of the

things I think about. It's one of

the things I look forward to. I've

been looking forward.

ANN

Me too.

LETOUR

(touches her hand)

Something can be right in front of

you and you can't see it.

ANN

(kisses his hand)

Strange how things work.

THE END
