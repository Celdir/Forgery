MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

(tortured)

God grant me the Serenity to accept

the things I cannot change...

MARSHALL (V.O.)

Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

Courage to change the things I

can...

MARSHALL (V.O.)

Come on, you've been a good boy for

a long time, you deserve a little

fun.

DISSOLVE THROUGH

THIS TO:

MR. BROOKS

... and Wisdom to know the

difference.

MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)

Living one day at a time, Enjoying

one moment at a time, Accepting

hardship as a pathway to peace...

(CONTINUED)

2.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

(even faster now)

... Taking, as He did, this sinful

world as it is, not as I would have

it. Trusting that He will make all

things right if I surrender to His

will. That I may be reasonably

happy in this life, And supremely

happy with Him forever in the next.

Amen.

MAN

I could go on and on about what a

great guy Earl is, how he cuts his

toe nails...

MAN

... how he gives freely of his time

and money, but let's get Earl up

here to speak for himself. Ladies

and Gentlemen, I give you a

businessman, a philanthropist, a

great friend and the Evanston

Chamber of Commerce Man of the

Year... Mr. Earl Brooks.

MR. BROOKS

Thank you all very much. The first

thing I would like to say is... I

don't even know how I cut my toe

nails.

MR. BROOKS

Twenty years ago when I started the

Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed

I would one day be standing here.

3.

EMMA (V.O.)

Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?

EMMA

You could see her nipples. At her

age she should keep those things

hidden.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

God grant me the Serenity to

accept...

EMMA

The only thing that would have made

this evening more perfect is if

Jane had been here.

MR. BROOKS

She called. She has mid terms

coming up.

EMMA

She's dropping out, you know.

MR. BROOKS

We'll see.

EMMA

Nothing she does is wrong to you,

is it?...

EMMA

Well she missed a good party...

(CONTINUED)

4.

MARSHALL

Come on, Earl, give yourself a

break, you know you want to do

this.

MR. BROOKS

No.

MARSHALL

You're the fucking 'man of the

year', you deserve it. It's not

like it's not set up. You already

know how to by-pass the alarm, you

know how to pick the locks.

Tonight's the perfect night.

MR. BROOKS

(over his shoulder)

No, Marshall, I said 'no'!

MARSHALL

I heard you, Earl, but you don't

mean 'no'.

EMMA

What's the matter?

MR. BROOKS

Nothing.

EMMA

You were frowning.

MR. BROOKS

I was thinking of what I didn't say

in the speech.

EMMA

They laughed, they were touched, I

don't think anyone felt left out.

(CONTINUED)

5.

MARSHALL

(from the back seat)

They have their dance class

tonight. What if we go by and just

look at them. There's no harm in

just having a look.

MR. BROOKS

No means 'no', Marshall.

MARSHALL

Please... pretty please.

MR. BROOKS

(to Emma)

The food tonight was very good, but

I wasn't crazy about the dessert.

Would you like to stop somewhere

and get something sweet?

EMMA

... Labradors are supposed to be

nice, or maybe a rescue mutt...

MR. BROOKS

The Pound's a pretty sad place; if

you want me to, I'll go with you.

EMMA

There's an Irish Lab I read about,

and I think the breeder is...

(CONTINUED)

6.

MARSHALL

I bet your dick's getting hard,

isn't it, just imagining what they

would look like dead?

MR. BROOKS

... I can't do this, I can't do

this, I can't do this, please don't

let me do this, God grant me the

Serenity to accept the things I

cannot change...

MR. BROOKS

I'm going to stay up a while, maybe

go to the studio and play with some

glazes.

EMMA

Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not

awake, wake me when you come back.

MR. BROOKS

I thought you were wonderful

tonight.

7.

MR. BROOKS

(to himself)

Don't do this, don't do this,

please don't do this, don't do

this, don't do, please don't do

this...

(CONTINUED)

8.

MARSHALL

Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed

this! We are going to have so much

fun!

MR. BROOKS

This is the last time, Marshall.

Understand me?! The very last time!

(CONTINUED)

9.

MARSHALL

Don't you dare quit on me, you

piece of shit. I want to see what

they're doing.

MR. BROOKS

Hello.

MAN

What the fuck?!

MAN

Hey, man, don't...

(CONTINUED)

10.

MR. BROOKS

(to the Woman)

Be quiet and sit up.

MARSHALL (O.S.)

(barks)

Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is

this?!!

MARSHALL

These pigs liked to fuck with the

blinds open, you should have known

that, Earl. This is a big mistake

for you, Earl.

MR. BROOKS

(going to the window)

Almost like I want to get caught,

huh, Marshall?

MARSHALL

Well, don't fucking do that. I

don't think either of us would

enjoy spending the rest of our

lives in jail or a lethal

injection.

(CONTINUED)

11.

MR. BROOKS

Yes, sir.

CUT TO:

MR. BROOKS

Please forgive me... Please forgive

me...

MARSHALL

Don't even think about it. You know

the rules.

MARSHALL

Now go up and make love to your

beautiful wife.

(CONTINUED)

12.

OLDER DETECTIVE

Where the fuck is Atwood?!

YOUNG DETECTIVE

I called ten minutes ago, they said

she was on her way.

OLDER DETECTIVE

She doesn't get here soon, these

bodies won't even be dead anymore?

COP

You looking for the lady Cop?

OLDER DETECTIVE

Yeah.

COP

She's here. She's been sitting in

her car right over there for the

last half hour.

OLDER DETECTIVE

Oh, Christ.

OLDER DETECTIVE

You thinking of joining us anytime

soon, Atwood?

(CONTINUED)

13.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I really hated yesterday, Snyder,

and then today came along.

SNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE)

What happened to your wrists?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I tried to commit suicide.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What's so funny?

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it

was because you were drunk and got

into a fight with a fish tank.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Who are you gonna believe? Me or

the fucking fish?!

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Eh... you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Good.

YOUNG DETECTIVE

(under his breath)

She's nuts!

SNYDER

And rich.

(CONTINUED)

14.

SNYDER

There are some scratches in the

side door cylinder. Other than that

no signs of forced entry. The alarm

was armed and we even had to cut

the security chains to get in.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(straightens up)

This guy hasn't been active for

over two years...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

... we think he's either dead or in

jail on some other charge. This is

probably a copycat.

SNYDER

That's why we called you. You're

the God that tells us peons if we

have a simple murder here or

something we can dump on you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Bite yourself.

15.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(indicating the Victims)

He always rearranges the bodies,

but this is out of character. He

has never left them in such a crude

position. Usually it's more

romantic with their arms around

each other, kissing, their mouths

open, their tongues touching.

SNYDER

So we have a copycat?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Where are the thumbprints?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

One his one hers?

SNYDER

That's what it looks like.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What's that?

SNYDER

The bullets went completely through

the victims. The killer recovered

the slugs.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Were these open or closed when you

got here?

(CONTINUED)

16.

SNYDER

Closed.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Hmm...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

It has never been revealed to the

public that the Thumbprint Killer

retrieves the slugs.

SNYDER

So this one's yours.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I don't fucking need this.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Have you checked the tenants of

that building?

SNYDER

Only a few of them are home, they

say they didn't see anything. We

checked the whole neighborhood, so

far nobody saw a thing.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Leaving them like this, he must

have been angry at them for some

reason.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Where would they keep their vacuum

cleaner.

(CONTINUED)

17.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'll bet you a hundred bucks,

Snyder, there is no bag in that

vacuum cleaner.

SNYDER

I have no idea what you're looking

for.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

He vacuumed the house and took the

bag.

SNYDER

Oh, shit. That is scary smart.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Okay.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Our best hope is if someone in

there saw something.

MAN

Detective Tracy Atwood?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yes.

MAN

This is for you.

MAN

You have been served.

(CONTINUED)

18.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You fucking asshole!! I'm in the

middle of a fucking murder

investigation!!

MAN

(backing away)

Hey, take it easy lady, I'm just

the messenger.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Goddamit!!

SNYDER

What is it?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

My soon to be ex-husband's scumbag

lawyer is trying to show me how

painful she can make my life if I

don't give them what they want.

SNYDER

This is not the Doctor.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

The doctor was a couple years ago.

This one is my stupid mistake.

LEADER

Are there any new members?

WOMAN

Hi, my name is Vaughn and I'm an

alcoholic.

MR. BROOKS

Hi, my name is Earl and I'm an

addict.

(CONTINUED)

19.

MARSHALL

You're such a fucking hypocrite. If

you were honest you would step out

there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl. I

killed two people last night and I

really got off on it, but I need

your help to be cured.'

MR. BROOKS

I'm different Marshall, I won't

argue that with you. This is the

only place that has ever helped me

be normal and I've been straight up

until last night for the past two

years. I'm not going to kill again

and I'm not going to quit coming

here because it upsets you.

MARSHALL

Yeah but for the next 29 days

you're going to have to step out

there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl, I'm an

addict.' And everybody will know

you fell off the wagon. Don't you

feel stupid doing that?

MR. BROOKS

No. I feel good.

(CONTINUED)

20.

MR. BROOKS

This is not the top of the line or

the bottom, but for the money we're

talking about this is the quality I

can provide you.

MR. BROOKS

Your packaging is the first

impression your customers will have

of your product...

PA SYSTEM

Mr. Brooks, your daughter is

waiting for you in your office.

MR. BROOKS

... We'd love to work you with on

the design. It's fun to challenge

our machines. If you check around,

you'll find we're not the cheapest,

but we are the best.

MR. BROOKS

Sunday, did Jane call and say she

was coming?

SUNDAY

I would have given you that

message, Mr. Brooks. She has boxes

and suitcases downstairs.

MR. BROOKS

Hold my calls.

MR. BROOKS

(coming in)

What are you doing here, Gorgeous?

(CONTINUED)

21.

JANE

I'm sorry, Daddy, please don't be

angry with me.

MR. BROOKS

I can guess what you've done, but

why don't you tell me and then I'll

decide.

JANE

I dropped out of school.

MR. BROOKS

Okay. Have you told your mother

this?

JANE

No. I wanted to speak to you first.

MR. BROOKS

You'll have to tell her, I'm not

going to do that for you, and then

together the three of us will

decide where to go from here.

JANE

I've thought a lot about this, Dad.

College is a waste of time for me.

MR. BROOKS

I don't know how you know that half

way through your Freshman year,

but...

JANE

You didn't go to college, Dad, and

you're successful. I want to come

and work for you.

MARSHALL

She's not telling you everything,

she's hiding something.

(CONTINUED)

22.

MR. BROOKS

I know.

(to Jane)

I'm not hiring right now.

JANE

Just listen to me. What would

happen to the business if, God

forbid, something happened to you?

Mom would probably have to sell to

strangers. I'm willing to start at

the bottom, you can treat me as a

regular employee, I want to learn

everything there is to know about

running the box business, and then

when the time comes, the business

would stay in the family.

MR. BROOKS

That's sweet, but you're talking

about emotion, not business. In

fact your mother and I came very

close to selling out last year.

JANE

What?!

MR. BROOKS

If we had been offered a little

more money, and they may come back

to us, we will sell.

JANE

What would you do without...?!

MR. BROOKS

Yes?

SUNDAY

I'm sorry, I know you didn't want

to be disturbed, the Man in the

waiting room insisted I give you

this.

(CONTINUED)

23.

SUNDAY

He said you would find what's

inside very interesting.

MR. BROOKS

What is he? A salesman?

SUNDAY

He won't say. I've never seen him

before. I can tell him to go away

if you want me to.

MR. BROOKS

That's okay.

MR. BROOKS

Part of spending the four years in

college is to...

MR. BROOKS

... eh... to give yourself the

chance to find out who you are and

what you want to do.

JANE

I'll talk to Mom, but I'm not going

back to school.

MR. BROOKS

Where would you live?

JANE

To save money I would move back

home, but no rules, no curfew, I

want to be treated like an adult.

(CONTINUED)

24.

MR. BROOKS

Would you pay for your food, would

you pay rent?

JANE

No, dad, you're a very wealthy man,

you can afford to keep me.

MR. BROOKS

Sunday, would you show the

gentleman who gave you the envelope

to the conference room, and tell

him I'll meet him there and...

(to Jane)

What happened to the BMW?

JANE

A friend is driving it across

country, it'll be here next

weekend.

MR. BROOKS

(to Sunday, through

Intercom)

And get Jane a cab.

MR. BROOKS

Call your mother.

JANE

Are you going to give me a job?

MR. BROOKS

If it were up to me, and I think

your mother will agree with this,

you should go back to school.

MR. BROOKS

You see all of this?! The factory,

the houses, the cars, the money,

the respect!!...

(CONTINUED)

25.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

... I like them! I don't want to

lose them!

MR. BROOKS

... That's why I didn't want to do

the dance Couple!

MARSHALL

Stop your fucking whining, Earl,

you enjoyed doing that Couple just

as much as I did, and look on the

bright side, he came to us he

didn't go to the Cops. If he tries

to shake us down we kill him.

Period. We make it fun but we kill

him. End of story.

MR. BROOKS

What can I do for you, Mr...?

MAN

... Let's say, 'Smith'.

MR. BROOKS

Okay, Mr. Smith.

MR. SMITH (MAN)

(sitting)

Before you get the wrong

impression, Mr. Brooks, I'm not

here to shake you down.

(CONTINUED)

26.

MR. BROOKS

(holding up the photos)

Then these are the only copies of

these photos and you have no

others.

MR. SMITH

No. I have other copies and other

photos, and if something were to

happen to me...

MR. BROOKS

How did you find me, Mr. Smith?

MR. SMITH

You're 'Man of the Year', Mr.

Brooks. Your picture was in the

paper. If it hadn't been, I don't

know what I would have done.

MR. BROOKS

Lucky me. What is it that I can

help you with?

MR. SMITH

I've been watching that Couple for

months, they liked to make love

with the blinds open. Sometimes I

would take pictures, you know,

visual aides for later. It was fun,

it was a great way to get off; I

thought, until I saw you kill them.

I have to tell you I have never

ever felt a rush like that ever. I

know you're the Thumbprint killer,

you've done this before. What I

want is to go with you the next

time you kill someone. And I would

like that to be soon.

MARSHALL

And you were worried that this was

going to be unpleasant. The answer

is simple. Just tell him you've

decided never to kill again and

he'll go away.

MR. BROOKS

You enjoy watching me suffer, don't

you?

(CONTINUED)

27.

MARSHALL

In a word, yes.

MR. BROOKS

Where do you think he has the other

pictures?

MARSHALL

He put them in a safety deposit box

but I'll bet the box is at the bank

where he has his checking account

and the key is on his keychain. He

really wants to do this, he's not

going to go to the cops.

MR. SMITH

So do we have a deal?

MR. BROOKS

From the angle of these pictures...

(taps the envelope)

... you live on the third floor of

the apartment building across the

alley from the Couple's house.

MR. SMITH

Well... eh.

MR. BROOKS

Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

MR. BROOKS

What time do you get home from

work?

MR. SMITH

Six thirty, seven, depending on the

traffic.

MR. BROOKS

You can never come here again, you

can never call me. Do you

understand that?

MR. SMITH

Yes.

(CONTINUED)

28.

MR. BROOKS

Tomorrow night, not tonight,

tomorrow night, at eight o'clock,

leave your apartment and walk east.

I'll pick you up.

MR. SMITH

If you're thinking of doing

anything to me, Mr. Brooks...

MR. BROOKS

We're both aware of the rules, Mr.

Smith, but I feel I must warn you.

If it turns out that you enjoy

killing, it can become very

addictive. It could ruin your life.

MR. SMITH

I want to do this.

MR. BROOKS

(looks at Marshall)

Have I covered everything?

MARSHALL

I can't think of anything else.

MR. BROOKS

I'll see you tomorrow night, Mr.

Smith.

MR. BROOKS

(under his breath)

Please God, please help me find a

way not to do this.

(CONTINUED)

ASIAN ATTORNEY

We've talked to our client and

we've come up with a number that we

feel is more than fair.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

We can have a check for that amount

in your office by 6 o'clock.

SHEILA

We told you at the beginning what

we want and that hasn't changed.

GRAY-HAIRED ATTORNEY

You know as well as I do,

Counselor, if we go to court you're

not going to get a million five.

SHEILA

I don't know. Let's see.

SHEILA

This is the front page of

yesterday's paper...

(reads)

'Hangman Escapes'... eh... now,

here it is... 'after torturing the

young women, Thorton Meeks would

hang them in public places - church

steeples, balconies, Freeway

overpasses'... Your client captured

Mr. Meeks. This is just one example

of the cases my client lived

through when he was married to your

client.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Your client knew Detective Atwood

was a homicide detective when he

married her.

(CONTINUED)

30.

SHEILA

But he had no idea of the mental

anguish that being in close

proximity to her work would cause

him.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What about the mental anguish I

went through being in close

proximity to him. Who's gonna pay

me for that?

ASIAN ATTORNEY

We don't need to get into this,

Tracy.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yes, we do. I was the one who paid

for everything while we were

married, and now I'm being asked to

give him a bonus for spending time

with me when I've already paid for

it in the first place.

JESSE

(to Atwood)

Tracy, this is not a lot of money

for you, and you know how upset I

was when Meeks said that he was

going to escape and he would come

back and kill you.

SHEILA

We're quite willing to find out

what a court would think that

mental anguish is worth.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Jesse... Darling?... you know the

best thing that could happen to me

right now? That you get hit by a

truck and die.

SHEILA

(smiles)

That's it! Mr. Vialo and I are

leaving.

(she and Jesse stand up)

You've threatened my client, we're

going to ask for a restraining

order, and we'll see you in court.

(CONTINUED)

31.

GRAY-HAIRED ATTORNEY

That's going to cost you, Tracy.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(standing up)

Fuck it. It felt good.

MR. SMITH

Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!!

MR. BROOKS

Don't worry, if I were here to kill

you, you would already be dead.

MR. BROOKS

After you left today, I realized

our friendship was a little one-

sided.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

32.

MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)

So when we meet tomorrow night

would you be so kind as to bring

all of the pictures and the memory

card from your camera. That way we

can like each other simply for who

we are. If you don't show up, I

will presume you've gone to the

police and I will kill you. Even if

I go to jail because of you,

someone will find you wherever you

are and kill you.

MR. SMITH

(squeaks)

Mr. Brooks?...

MR. SMITH

Mr. Brooks?...

MR. SMITH

Wow!...

33.

MR. BROOKS

(quietly)

It's nice to have you home.

MR. BROOKS

What's wrong?

EMMA

Ask your daughter what the real

reason is she dropped out of

school.

JANE

I keep telling you it's not the

reason.

(CONTINUED)

34.

EMMA

You wanted to go to college, you

had good grades in High School,

your father helped you get into

Stanford, we're paying a ton of

money, if this is not the reason,

then please dear God tell me the

reason.

MR. BROOKS

(picking up an orange

juice)

Why does your mother think you

dropped out of school?

JANE

I'm pregnant.

(to her Mother)

And it's not the reason I dropped

out. Being pregnant wouldn't stop

me from going to school if I wanted

to go.

MR. BROOKS

Who's the father?

JANE

Some guy I was seeing.

EMMA

Does he know?

JANE

Yes, he's a married man and he

doesn't want to have anything to do

with me.

EMMA

Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry.

JANE

I'm going to have an abortion

anyway, so there is nothing to get

upset about. I wasn't even going to

tell you guys.

MR. BROOKS

There will be no abortion.

(CONTINUED)

35.

JANE

Daddy, you are not going to tell me

what to do. It's my body and I will

do what I want to do with it.

MR. BROOKS

(to his Daughter)

You're right. I'm sorry. I said it

wrong. I'm not trying to tell you

what to do. I'm trying to say that

a grandchild would be a wonderful

gift for your mother and me.

EMMA

Please, Honey, don't have an

abortion.

JANE

Would you really want to have a

grandchild, even though I'm not

married?

MR. BROOKS

Yes. The child is what's important.

We would love it and cherish it

completely and help you raise it.

JANE

If it means that much to you, I'll

think about it.

MR. BROOKS

(smiles)

Well, we were right, she was hiding

something.

MARSHALL

(flat)

Pregnant's not all of it. She's

hiding something bigger. Much

bigger.

MR. BROOKS

You think so?

(CONTINUED)

36.

MARSHALL

I know so, and so do you.

TECHNICIAN

It's not what's here, it's what's

not here that's interesting.

There's not a trace of anything

foreign. If I didn't know better

I'd say these people were killed by

a ghost.

CAPTAIN LISTER

The autopsy found a tiny piece of

plastic in the female victim's

brain.

TECHNICIAN

We're checking with the ammunition

manufacturers.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(entering the room)

That's a dead end, he bags the gun.

TECHNICIAN

I don't understand.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

He ziplocks a one gallon plastic

freezer bag to his wrist over the

gun. Bang. Bang. A little bit of

plastic is carried by the first

slug, the ejected shells go into

the bag and it limits the powder

residue.

(to Captain Lister)

I hear you were looking for me.

CAPTAIN LISTER

(to the Technician)

Sigy...

(CONTINUED)

37.

SIGY (TECHNICIAN)

Yeah, okay...

(to Atwood)

Did you find anything? Did they

have enemies, did they owe money,

did anybody ever notice someone

watching the house?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

So far they are Mr. and Miss

Normal.

SIGY

(backing away)

If you find anything, call, it

might help me.

CAPTAIN LISTER

I received a subpoena from your

husband's lawyer for your work

records, where you were, date and

times for the past two years.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That's blackmail.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Almost three quarters of your cases

are current. I can't let that

information go into open court. So

until you settle your divorce, I'm

going to have to put you on a desk.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That's also blackmail.

CAPTAIN LISTER

That's one of your big problems,

Atwood, you don't know how to ask

for help.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Do you know what he did to me?

CAPTAIN LISTER

You can't grow old as a woman

without having at least one lousy

man in your life.

(CONTINUED)

38.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I was so stupid. While we were

married, while I paid for him to

live, the son of a bitch fucked

every woman he could get his hands

on. He fucked my friends, he even

fucked a cousin of mine. Everyone

knew but me, and they were laughing

at me behind my back. He made me

look like an idiot. I was a joke.

CAPTAIN LISTER

And?...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

And what?

CAPTAIN LISTER

Get over it.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I made him an offer. I'm not going

to give him one red cent more.

CAPTAIN LISTER

I hear what he's asking for, you

could take out of pocket change. Do

that and go on with your life.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I couldn't live with myself if I

did.

CAPTAIN LISTER

I'll spread your work among the

other guys and the FBI will be here

on thursday...

(motions to the pictures)

... they'll take over this case.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Please, these are my cases. Nobody

knows them like me. Don't give them

away and don't give the Thumbprint

Killer to the FBI. He's killed

people in twelve other states, let

them fuck up those investigations.

This one's mine.

(CONTINUED)

39.

CAPTAIN LISTER

(opening the door to

leave)

You heard Meeks escaped?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yeah.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Do you want a detail on you in case

he comes after you?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I can take care of myself.

CAPTAIN LISTER

You're a good cop, Tracy, I don't

want to lose you, but you have to

help me if you want me to help you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What is wrong with me? What is

wrong with me? What is wrong with

me?

(CONTINUED)

40.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Did you choose them because of

where they lived or how they looked

or what jobs they had? Or did you

just pick them because at the

instant you saw them, you had

decided to kill someone? The side

door was perfect. No one could see

you pick the lock.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

How did you know where they were in

the house?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

It's darker tonight than it was on

your night. But still how did you

manage not to bump into the

furniture? Did you have a little

light? That would be too dangerous.

I'll bet you were in the house

before.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

41.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD (CONT'D)

So I should ask the neighbors if

they saw a meter reader around the

house or a telephone repairman or

someone from the gas company.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Once again, how did you know where

they were? Did you check the rooms

before you found them? She had his

semen in her vagina, they had just

made love, did you hear them or was

there a light on?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

And when did you bag the gun?

Because even though I'm sure you're

an expert at it, there's still a

chance of noise from the plastic.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Was the door open or did you have

to open it?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Were they asleep or awake? Was the

light on, or did you turn it on?

Because I know you, you wouldn't

risk a shot in the dark.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Too bright. What if it wasn't that

light that was on, but this one?

(CONTINUED)

42.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That's better... What thrill do you

get by killing people? Is it

sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do

you feel remorse? Probably that

part of your brain doesn't exist.

Do you have emotions of love or

affection or joy? Or have you

learned to fake them so you won't

stand out in a crowd.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What if these are stuck closed

because you yanked them closed?

Which means they were open when you

came into the room.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

If Mr. and Miss Normal made love

with the curtains open and the

lights on, someone in that building

noticed them and may have seen you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Was that what you were angry about?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD (O.S.)

Thank you for your time.

(CONTINUED)

43.

MR. SMITH

Oh! You scared me.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'm sorry...

(bends down and picks up

the envelope)

... I was about to knock. I'm

Detective Atwood with the Chicago

Police.

MR. SMITH

(accepting the envelope)

Thank you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Are you a photographer...

(glances at her list)

Mr. Baffert?

MR. SMITH

No... eh, it's kind of a hobby, I

just started.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I don't know if you're aware but

there was a murder...

MR. SMITH

Oh, yes in the house across the

alley...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Did you happen to see anything

unusual or suspicious that night

around that house? Anything at all?

MR. SMITH

No... I wondered that when I heard

what happened, but... no.

(looks at his watch)

I'm sorry, I'm meeting someone and

I don't want to be late.

(CONTINUED)

44.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Here's my card, if you hear

anything or remember anything.

MR. SMITH

(taking the card)

I wish I could be of more help, but

sorry.

MR. BROOKS

He looks clean. He looks like he's

alone.

MARSHALL

No, I'm telling you he wants to do

this.

MR. BROOKS

I guess I should turn around and go

pick him up.

MARSHALL

Nah. Just honk. Maybe he'll get

killed crossing the street and save

us the mess of doing it.

(CONTINUED)

45.

MR. SMITH

Woof! It's really coming down out

there.

MR. BROOKS

They say it'll be sunny tomorrow.

MR. SMITH

I never trust those guys, when they

say it's going to be clear it

always rains and when they say it's

going to rain, it's sunny.

MR. SMITH

Here's what you asked for.

MR. BROOKS

The pictures and the memory card

all here?

MR. SMITH

Yeah.

MR. BROOKS

You and I both know that not all

the pictures are in here and you

made a copy of the Memory Card,

isn't that so?

MR. SMITH

But you understand my position.

(CONTINUED)

46.

MR. BROOKS

Yes, I do. But it's my hope that

once you get to know me better

you'll feel comfortable in giving

me all that I've asked for.

MR. SMITH

That sounds fair. Oh, I almost

forgot. I thought you might be

interested in this.

MR. SMITH

It's the policewoman who's looking

for you.

MARSHALL

Wow! We've never known anyone who's

looking for us before.

MARSHALL

We've got to find out everything

there is to know about this woman.

MR. BROOKS

This is too close, Marshall, too

damn close.

MR. SMITH

So, what do we do now? What's the

plan for the evening?

MR. BROOKS

We drive around until we see

someone we think we might enjoy

killing.

MR. SMITH

Really? That's it? I thought you

might already have someone in mind.

(CONTINUED)

47.

MR. BROOKS

I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith. I do

it because I'm addicted to it. And

before you entered my life I had

vowed I would never kill again. So

this is your party, you can chose

anyone you want and we'll do it

together.

MR. SMITH

Can it be someone I know?

MR. BROOKS

You never kill someone you know.

That's the easiest way to get

caught.

STEWARDESS

I wasn't in town that night, my

roommate was, maybe he saw

something.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

May I speak to him?

STEWARDESS

He's on his way to Tokyo now, he's

also a Flight Attendant.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Did the victims ever leave the

curtains in the bedroom open?

STEWARDESS

All the time. I don't know if they

thought we couldn't see them

"fucking" or they didn't care.

(CONTINUED)

48.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Here's my card, could you ask your

roommate to call me when he gets

back, the people at that number

will find me any hour of the day or

night.

STEWARDESS

I won't be here, but I'll leave him

a note.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

... maybe I already know how to

pick the locks on the house, if I

don't...

MR. BROOKS

... I buy one of those locks and I

practice on it, same with the

alarm... some I know how to bypass,

some I have to study.

MR. SMITH

You don't mind me asking these

questions?

MR. BROOKS

No. This is your first time, you're

interested. And you should be if

you're...

MR. SMITH

Jesus Christ!!

(CONTINUED)

49.

MR. SMITH

Fuck him!! It was his fault!! What

an asshole!!

MARSHALL

(leans forward)

Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill

the driver of the pickup.

MR. BROOKS

(to Mr. Smith)

What about the driver of the

pickup? What if we killed him?

MR. SMITH

Oh, fuck, yes!! I've always wanted

to kill someone who fucked with me

in traffic.

MR. BROOKS

Do you want to kill the driver of

the pickup or the owner, they may

not be the same.

MR. SMITH

The driver.

MR. BROOKS

Okay we'll follow until we get a

look at him, or her; would it

bother you to kill a woman?

MR. SMITH

No. An asshole's an asshole.

MR. SMITH

What are you doing?

MR. BROOKS

The asshole shouldn't know we've

decided to follow him, or her.

(CONTINUED)

50.

MALE VOICE

(answers)

Yes?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(puts the phone to her

ear)

It's Tracy. Can you carve out some

time for me tonight?... I'll be

home in an hour and a half. I'll

see you there.

(CONTINUED)

51.

MR. BROOKS

Would you recognize him if you saw

his driver's license picture?

MR. SMITH

Yeah.

MR. BROOKS

I've memorized the license number,

you write it down. When you get

home go on the Internet and find

out everything you can about this

guy.

MR. SMITH

We aren't going to kill him

tonight?

MR. BROOKS

No. We could, but then we wouldn't

be in control. We could leave loose

ends, and we both know the danger

of that.

MR. SMITH

(squints at the Pickup's

license)

I got it.

MR. BROOKS

Look at me.

MR. BROOKS

Close your eyes. What's the number?

MR. SMITH

VF... eh...

MR. BROOKS

Don't feel bad, I've been doing

this a long time...

(he points to a holder on

the dash)

Pen, paper. Write it down.

MR. SMITH

(copying the number)

What was your first time?

(CONTINUED)

52.

MR. BROOKS

You really don't want to know that

much about me, Mr. Smith.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Hi.

LARRY

Hi. I brought a dress and a pair of

shoes. I thought we could leave

from here.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Great idea.

LARRY

... I gave him my driver's license,

my student ID, he didn't look

anything like me, luckily they

never checked.

(CONTINUED)

53.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I did something like that except I

was the one who took the test. It

wasn't math, a friend of mine was a

theology major and needed a second

language to get into the Master's

program...

LARRY

She started her career in theology

with a lie?!

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Isn't that what all theology is

based on?

LARRY

Did you pass the test?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Oh yeah...

LARRY

Don't tell me she ended up as

Mother Teresa or the Pope.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

No, she realized very quickly there

wasn't enough money in religion for

her, the last I heard she'd written

a diet book that was very

successful.

LARRY

She stayed in religion.

(CONTINUED)

54.

LARRY

Thank you, this was wonderful.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

For me too.

LARRY

I'll see you then?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'd like that. The money is in the

usual place.

LARRY

It's not just the money, Tracy. I

like you.

(CONTINUED)

55.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I like you too, Larry. Send me a

bill for the dress and the shoes.

LARRY

I will. Good-night.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Good-night.

MARSHALL (O.S.)

I think that was right. Go back.

MR. BROOKS (O.S.)

We're in.

MARSHALL (O.S.)

With the taxes we pay, you'd think

they could make it more difficult

to hack into the Police personnel

files.

(CONTINUED)

56.

MR. BROOKS

.... Huh... her father's Gerald

Atwood, why does that ring a bell?

MARSHALL

Someone you did business with,

someone we killed?

MR. BROOKS

Not someone we killed... MBA...

College of William and Mary...

she's been a cop for eleven

years... Married Doctor Carlson,

divorced Dr. Carlson, married Jesse

Vialo... restaurateur... separated

from Jesse Vialo, sued for support

by Jesse Vialo, seeing a shrink

because of Jesse Vialo...

MARSHALL

Excellent fitness report though.

MR. BROOKS

She caught the Hangman, the guy

that escaped the other day...

MARSHALL

Oooh... She's caught a lot of

people... And look here, this isn't

the first time she's been hunting

for us.

MR. BROOKS

I wonder what the deal was with her

and Jesse Vialo?

(CONTINUED)

57.

MR. BROOKS

Ahhhh... now I remember. Her

father, Gerald Atwood, never did

business with him but Emma and I

met him a couple times, big

political fundraiser. He owns or

owned one of the largest insurance

groups in the country and a lot of

other stuff.

MR. BROOKS

Jesse Vialo... Good looking, a

little younger than she is.

MARSHALL

Younger, restaurateur...

(snorts)

She married him on the rebound from

the doctor and I'll bet he married

her for her money and her

connections.

MR. BROOKS

The old man being rich doesn't mean

she's rich. Maybe he's one of those

guys who would rather give it to

the Opera than to his kids.

MARSHALL

Wouldn't she have to declare any

outside income and holdings to the

Police?

MR. BROOKS

Hmmm...

MR. BROOKS

The Opera didn't get much.

MARSHALL

Why would a woman with her

education and worth 60 plus million

dollars and probably more to come,

want to be a cop?

MR. BROOKS

I like that about her.

(CONTINUED)

58.

MARSHALL

You're such a fucking snob, Earl.

You like her because she's rich.

MR. BROOKS

No, I like her because she found

something that's hers. It's not the

family business. And she's good at

it. I'd like Jane to find something

that's hers and that she could be

good at.

MARSHALL

That's exactly why Atwood scares

the shit out of me. She's a cop who

doesn't need the money and she's

looking for us. That's one fucking

dangerous human being.

MR. BROOKS

The fact that you're not wrong

doesn't make me admire her any

less.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Hi...

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Hi. I got you a Latte.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(sitting)

Thanks and thanks for meeting me

here.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

We got an injunction to quash the

subpoena for your work records

yesterday. They've already

appealed.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That doesn't help me does it?

(CONTINUED)

59.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Your father has a lot of political

muscle.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

My father does nothing for nothing.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

I understand. If you're willing to

play the game and ride a desk for a

year; I think we can settle for one

two five, one five.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

No desk.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Then the only other option is

money. Tell me how high you are

willing to go.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

One five.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

I can try. If I were on the other

side I'd hold out for more.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

How much more?

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Give me a cap and that's how high

we'll go.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Try and get a number out of them

first. I want to know what ballpark

I'm playing in and if it's a lump

sum, is it less than something

that's paid in installments.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

I'll call them today.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'd like to get this done as soon

as possible.

(CONTINUED)

60.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Are you working on the Thumbprint

Killer this time?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yeah.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

That one's creepy to me. The doors

are locked, the alarms are armed

and the people are dead. It makes

you feel like you're not safe

anywhere.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Where are you parked?

ASIAN ATTORNEY

I'm right over there.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'm down the street. Call me as

soon as you have something.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Oh, Tracy... I almost forgot, your

husband says there's a picture of

him holding some trophy that you

still have.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

He took all those pictures. He took

everything.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

He claims it's his favorite picture

and you put it up where you store

your suitcases.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'll look.

(CONTINUED)

61.

ASIAN ATTORNEY

I know it's petty, but you're going

through a divorce.

MEEKS

Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told

you I was coming back to get you.

(CONTINUED)

62.

MEEKS

I already know where I'm gonna hang

you. But first I'm gonna watch

her...

(indicates the Driver)

... have some fun with you, then

she's gonna watch me have some fun

with you.

MEEKS

Now, don't move.

MEEKS

You know the drill, I'm gonna put

the cuffs on.

MEEKS

Now the left.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

SHOOT ME!!!

(CONTINUED)

63.

(CONTINUED)

64.

CAPTAIN LISTER

We found the van in an underground

lot about two miles from where they

left you. It was stolen last night.

SNYDER

These are the women we have

pictures of who know Meeks.

(CONTINUED)

65.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Meeks and the Woman, none of the

Attendants remember seeing them.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That chiropractor, Alvin Griffin,

who sold Meeks his steroids, he

might know where he is.

CAPTAIN LISTER

His phone's been tapped since Meeks

escaped. No contact that way so far

and he's sure not going to talk to

us.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What about a warrant to search his

house? Get me in the door and he'll

talk to me.

CAPTAIN LISTER

How's your divorce going?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I took your advice and told my

lawyer to settle.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

None of these is the woman in the

van.

DOCTOR

Whoa... I'm sewing up your head

here.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Sorry.

CAPTAIN LISTER

And your ego can handle that?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

It doesn't like any of the other

choices.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Until Meeks is caught, Snyder is

with you.

(CONTINUED)

66.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Nothing personal, Snyder.

(to Lister)

He's not part of our team.

CAPTAIN LISTER

He's there to protect you. And

listen to him, he's been alive

longer than you have.

SNYDER

I didn't volunteer for this,

Atwood.

CAPTAIN LISTER

The Parking Lot has a security

camera. We're checking the tape. If

Meeks and the Woman left in a car

we'll have a license number. You

have two days then I want a

progress report on your divorce.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I think I have all the pieces on

the Thumbprint Killer, I'm just not

looking at them the right way.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Okay, you have three days.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(smiles sweetly at Snyder)

Every babysitter I ever had loved

me.

(CONTINUED)

67.

MR. SMITH

Maybe he went home with someone

else.

MR. BROOKS

Can you still see his pickup?

MR. SMITH

Uh huh.

MR. BROOKS

This is not the kind of guy who

leaves his pickup in an unguarded

Lot overnight.

MR. BROOKS

Where do we know that guy from?

MARSHALL

You really should pay more

attention to what you read, Earl.

MR. BROOKS

That's what I have you for,

Marshall.

MARSHALL

His picture was on the front page

of the paper a couple days ago

because he escaped from jail. He's

the killer they call the Hangman.

(CONTINUED)

68.

MR. BROOKS

Ahh...

MARSHALL

Remember that cop you like, Atwood,

who's chasing us, she's the one who

put him away. I think his name is

Thorton Meeks.

MR. BROOKS

Well, well, well... What would life

be without surprises?

MR. SMITH

There he is!

MR. SMITH

You know what's weird? I'll bet he

has all these plans of what he's

going to do tonight and tomorrow

and he doesn't know he will already

be dead and won't be able to do any

of them.

MR. BROOKS

I don't think I want to kill this

guy.

MR. SMITH

What?! But you promised we would!

MARSHALL

Oh, I love what you're thinking.

MR. BROOKS

You have no idea what I'm thinking.

(CONTINUED)

69.

MARSHALL

Oh yes I do, and it's wonderfully

twisted.

MR. BROOKS

(to Mr. Smith)

I know I said we would, but I don't

think it would be that much fun.

MR. SMITH

So just like that, you're saying

'no', it's not going to happen.

MR. BROOKS

Yes.

MR. SMITH

(purses his lips into a

tight line)

I see.

MARSHALL

You get the number?

MR. BROOKS

I got it.

MARSHALL

Mr. Smith wants you to notice he's

pouting.

MR. BROOKS

Yeah, I know.

70.

MR. BROOKS

I know you're upset, Mr. Smith, and

I'm sorry.

MR. SMITH

Yeah, I am upset.

MR. BROOKS

Maybe I was a little abrupt back

there, but let me explain. Finding

someone you think would be fun to

kill is a bit like falling in love.

You meet a lot of candidates, and

you like some of them and they're

nice, but they're not right; and

then that special one shows up and

your heart beats faster and you

know that's the one. The man in the

pickup did not make my heart beat

faster.

MR. SMITH

Okay, he did not make your heart

beat faster. If not him, who?

MR. BROOKS

I don't know, I think I have

someone in mind.

MR. SMITH

Do you need me to do any work on

it?

MR. BROOKS

No, let's see how it plays out.

MR. SMITH

You see? That's my problem. That

makes me feel like I'm being jerked

around, Mr. Brooks. I thought it

was happening last night, then it

was happening tonight. And now it's

"Let's see how it plays out".

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

71.

MR. SMITH (CONT'D)

I feel like you're planning to back

out on our deal and I don't like

that feeling at all.

MR. BROOKS

I promise you, it will happen.

MR. SMITH

When? That's what I want to know,

Mr. Brooks. When?

MR. BROOKS

Tomorrow night, same time. When you

come out of your building, turn

right, go to the first street you

can go west on, I'll pick you up on

that street.

MR. SMITH

Okay.

MR. SMITH

I want to do this. But if it drags

on too long, I could change my

mind.

MR. BROOKS

Don't you think I want to do this,

Mr. Smith?

MR. SMITH

Maybe you don't anymore.

MARSHALL

Even if that guy was charming and

funny I still wouldn't like him.

72.

(CONTINUED)

73.

MR. BROOKS

Hi, what can I do for you?

DETECTIVE 1

I'm Detective Smolny with the

Chicago Police and this is

Detective Carfagno, from Palo Alto,

California...

CARFAGNO (DETECTIVE 2)

(showing his badge)

We'd like to speak to Jane Brooks,

if that's possible.

MR. BROOKS

Jane is my daughter, what's this

about?

CARFAGNO

There was a murder at Stanford not

long before she left. She may be

able to help us.

MR. BROOKS

Is she a suspect?

CARFAGNO

Not at this time. We simply would

like to ask her some questions.

SMOLNY (DETECTIVE 1)

Is your daughter here?

(CONTINUED)

74.

MR. BROOKS

Yes... she is.

CARFAGNO

The questions won't take long.

MR. BROOKS

I'm sure you would have no

objection if she had an attorney

present.

SMOLNY

That's fine.

(reaching into his pocket)

Here's my card. We can schedule a

time for later today or tomorrow

for her to come in to see us.

MR. BROOKS

If you gentlemen can wait, I will

call my lawyer right now and see

what we can work out.

SMOLNY

Oh, that's even better.

MR. BROOKS

(opening the door wider)

Would you like some coffee?

SMOLNY

Thank you.

MARSHALL

We both knew she was hiding

something bigger, I certainly

didn't think it was this big.

MR. BROOKS

She's not a suspect, Marshall. She

may not have anything to do with it

at all.

(CONTINUED)

75.

MR. BROOKS

Did Jane ever tell you that there

was a murder at her school?

EMMA

No.

MR. BROOKS

Nothing? Not that a friend died or

someone she knew died? Or someone

in her dorm died?

EMMA

No.

MR. BROOKS

There are two Detectives

downstairs, one is from Palo Alto,

they want to ask her some questions

about a murder that occurred

shortly before she came home.

EMMA

Oh, my Gosh! I'm sure if she was

close to someone who was murdered,

she would have said something.

MR. BROOKS

I called Roger, he suggested a

criminal attorney, they'll be here

within the hour.

EMMA

I'll get dressed.

(CONTINUED)

76.

MR. BROOKS

Mr. Clifford, it was a pleasure.

Thank you for coming on such short

notice.

HEAVYSET LAWYER

There won't be any more dropping by

like they did today, they'll call

us first.

MR. BROOKS

Thanks again, Roger. It was a good

idea to hear what they wanted to

know sooner rather than later.

MR. CLIFFORD

We'll talk.

MR. BROOKS

Yup.

(CONTINUED)

77.

MR. BROOKS

You did good, Kid. Your answers

were clear, concise and honest. And

when they tried to trip you up, it

didn't work.

JANE

I hope so. I'm not feeling so well.

EMMA

Should you lie down?

JANE

I think I'd better.

MR. BROOKS

Try and get some sleep.

MR. BROOKS

(to Emma)

I think Roger has a handle on this.

He and Mr. Clifford will take care

of it.

JANE

I'm sorry I didn't tell you about

it, Daddy. It was horrible but I

really didn't know the guy that

well. It happened at about the same

time I found out I was pregnant,

and it just went out of my mind.

MR. BROOKS

I understand.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

78.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

God grant me the Serenity to accept

the things I cannot change, Courage

to change the things I can, and

Wisdom to know the difference...

MR. BROOKS

God help me. What do I do?

MARSHALL

She did it, didn't she?

MR. BROOKS

Yeah. It'll take the Cops a week to

ten days to put their case together

and then they'll come back and

arrest her.

MARSHALL

What are you going to do?

MR. BROOKS

I've been afraid of this since the

day she was born. She has what I

have.

MARSHALL

Yes, she does. But you've always

been smart about it. She was

stupid. She did it because she got

off on it, she did it for fun. Why

didn't she think it through? A

hatchet! And she left it there!!

MR. BROOKS

They were pretty graphic, weren't

they?

MARSHALL

That was to shock her into making a

mistake.

(CONTINUED)

79.

MR. BROOKS

What does she think I think?

Doesn't she remember what she told

me? That the BMW was being driven

across country by a friend and now

right in front of me, she tells the

Cops it was stolen.

MARSHALL

You've always cleaned up after her,

whatever she did, all her life.

MR. BROOKS

If the BMW has anything

incriminating in it, I hope it was

stolen or she dropped it at the

bottom of a very deep lake.

MARSHALL

Do you think she knows what kind of

trouble she's in?

MR. BROOKS

I think she thought she had gotten

away with it until the Cops showed

up. I should have listened to her,

it was there. She was telling me.

'I didn't quit school because I was

pregnant'. I should have dug

deeper.

MARSHALL

And where would you be but at the

exact same place you are now. It is

not your fault, Earl. Part of your

problem with her is that you always

think it is.

MR. BROOKS

She has what I have, Marshall. So

on a very basic level, it is my

fault.

MARSHALL

What are you going to do?

MR. BROOKS

Maybe the best thing for her would

be to let her go to jail.

MARSHALL

And what about her child?

(CONTINUED)

80.

MR. BROOKS

Emma and I would raise it.

MARSHALL

You might be right, Earl, you might

be. Because you know if she's not

stopped, she's going to do it

again. And if she wants to take

over the box business, the next

victim could be you.

MR. BROOKS

I don't think she'd go that far.

SIGY (O.S.)

We found traces of this in two

places.

SIGY

(with a laser pointer)

Here and here.

SIGY

We did an analysis and it's made up

of feldspar, alumina and kaolin.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What's that?

SIGY

A high fire stoneware clay.

SNYDER

Like you make ashtrays and vases

from?

(CONTINUED)

81.

SIGY

This is more plates and teacups. It

was slightly wet when whoever it

was tracked it into the house and

it stuck to the carpet fibers.

We're thinking it was the killer.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

It could have been tracked in by a

friend.

SIGY

That's the thing, you see, the

friend would have had to have been

there almost at the same time the

killer was. Otherwise the samples

would have been dry and the killer

would have vacuumed them up.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Is the clay rare, is it difficult

to get?

SIGY

You can buy it almost anywhere.

SNYDER

That's not much help, Sigy.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

And this is the only incongruity

you were able to find in the whole

house.

SIGY

We've done everything we know how

to do. It sure doesn't break the

case wide open, does it?.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

No, Sigy, it doesn't. It does give

me an excuse to ask someone some

new questions.

SUNDAY

Yes, Mr. Brooks?

(CONTINUED)

82.

MARSHALL

(from the couch)

Before you open your mouth, be very

sure this is the right thing to do.

MR. BROOKS

I will never be sure.

MARSHALL

You get pissed at me because I'm

always the one arguing to go ahead

and do murder. Not this time, Earl.

This is your decision.

MR. BROOKS

I know it's wrong. In my heart I

know it's wrong.

MARSHALL

Then don't do it. Go with Mr. Smith

tonight and end that, then let the

Police put Jane in jail. Hopefully

that will save her and we can

happily go on with our tortured

lives.

MR. BROOKS

That's exactly what I want to do.

That's exactly what I should do.

The thing is, she's my daughter and

I love her.

MR. BROOKS

I'm going home. Cancel everything

for the rest of the day. I might be

in tomorrow afternoon. I'll let you

know about that.

SUNDAY

I'll take care of it.

MR. BROOKS

If you need me, need me, call my

studio, that's where I'll be.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

83.

MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)

I probably won't pick up, just

leave a message.

SUNDAY

I'll try not to bother you.

MARSHALL

The thing that bothers me about

this, besides the fact we're not

prepared, and a multitude of other

things, is what does Mr. Smith do

when he's walking west tonight and

you don't show up. That little

freak could flip out.

MR. BROOKS

I'll take care of it on the way to

the airport.

(CONTINUED)

84.

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

Not - able - to - meet -

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

- tonight - Do - it - same -

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

- time - tomorrow -

MR. BROOKS

- night - Don't - be - stupid -.

MR. SMITH

Fuck you!

(CONTINUED)

85.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You remember me?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Would you step out of the car,

please, I want to talk to you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

So Mr. Baffert, what is that you

have to tell me?

MR. SMITH

What do you mean? I don't have

anything to tell you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Really? Because I was driving

around and I got this sudden

feeling that you had something to

tell me about the murders.

MR. SMITH

No. Nothing.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

That's disappointing. Because when

I left you the last time we talked,

I felt I had missed a clue that was

right in front of me that would

solve this whole case.

MR. SMITH

I don't know why you would feel

that.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Didn't you tell me you were an

amateur potter, that you made bowls

and vases?

(CONTINUED)

86.

MR. SMITH

No, I said I was an amateur

photographer.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Are you positive? Because we found

potter's clay on the carpet of the

murder house and I was sure you

said to me that you worked with

clay, that you made pots.

MR. SMITH

No. I said my hobby was

photography, not pottery.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Maybe that was it. The Stewardess

upstairs said the victims kept

their curtains open when they made

love. Could I see some of the

pictures you took of that Couple?

MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

Don't - be - stupid -.

MR. SMITH

You are harassing me, Detective

Atwood. You know very well I'm not

a potter and I don't have any

pictures! So my feeling is that

your feeling is wrong and that you

should move your car and let me go

home.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

What is your job here? What do you

do?

(CONTINUED)

87.

MR. SMITH

I'm a mechanical engineer.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You have to be pretty smart for

that, don't you?

MR. SMITH

I guess.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Then be smart, Mr. Baffert. You

lied to me right there at the end.

I'll be watching you. And when you

want to tell me the truth, you know

how to get in touch with me.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

See you later, alligator.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(under her breath)

Goddamit...

SNYDER

Captain Lister got us the search

warrant for Meeks' Chiropractor.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Good.

(shakes her head 'no',

frustrated)

Goddamit!, that guy knows

something...

(meaning Mr. Smith)

He almost told me and then

something happened.

SNYDER

You think he did it?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I don't think it's that simple.

88.

STEWARDESS

Here you are, Sir.

MR. BROOKS

Thank you.

MR. BROOKS

(almost inaudible whisper)

God grant me the Serenity to accept

the things I cannot change, Courage

to change the things I can, and

Wisdom to know the difference...

MR. BROOKS

You're awfully quiet back there.

(CONTINUED)

89.

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN (O.S.)

Mr. Alvin Griffin, this is the

Chicago Police.

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN

(continues)

We have a warrant to search your

home and premises. We're coming in.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Lights don't work.

(CONTINUED)

90.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(calls to the darkness in

back of her)

We have a dead woman in here.

SNYDER

Hey!

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I thought you were behind me.

SNYDER

The living room is clean.

(CONTINUED)

91.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Snyder, meet Mona.

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN

I called it in.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Do that outside.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(to Snyder, re: the body)

Meeks did this.

SNYDER

I thought Meeks hung people.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Meeks is a steroid freak. This

Refrigerator was always full of

steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's

niece, receptionist, lover and

keeper of the keys.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Well, the steroids are certainly

gone.

SNYDER

You think Meeks has Alvin with him?

(CONTINUED)

92.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Let's go see what's in the rest of

the house.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

93.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(getting to her feet)

Snyder, this is Alvin Griffin.

94.

MARSHALL

How do you feel?

MR. BROOKS

Dirty.

MARSHALL

That's understandable. You've never

killed for this reason before. The

feeling will go away.

MR. BROOKS

I don't think so. It's the whole

thing, Marshall. If I could find a

way to just disappear, where there

was absolutely no trace of me;

because eventually I will get

caught doing this. And it'll be

very embarrassing for me and Emma

and Jane. So I've been thinking...

is there a way that Mr. Smith could

kill me and make me disappear.

MARSHALL

Number one, Mr. Smith is not smart

enough to do that. Number two,

there is no reason, if you're

careful, to believe you will ever

get caught.

MR. BROOKS

I know I will have to plan it for

Mr. Smith, but I think that's what

I want to do.

MARSHALL

I'm not particularly fond of that

plan, Earl. Remember if you die, I

go with you and I like being alive.

I like eating, I like fucking, I

like killing.

(CONTINUED)

95.

MR. BROOKS

I have to end it, Marshall. One way

or the other. And I think this is

the best way.

MARSHALL

Well fuck you then.

EMMA

You worked all night.

MR. BROOKS

I had ideas for pots that took too

long and the clay kept winning...

(he kisses her)

I'll be fine.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

96.

MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)

And there's a yellow Chinese glaze

I'm trying to get right...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yes?

ASIAN ATTORNEY

Hi Tracy, this is Nancy Tang. We

received a counter offer. Are you

sitting down?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yeah, go ahead... He can't get

that, can he?!

(CONTINUED)

97.

NANCY (ASIAN ATTORNEY)

No, my sense of it is by asking for

five, they're hoping you'll settle

anywhere between two five and

three.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Never. How long can you stall them?

NANCY

They know you want this done

quickly, so they're going to expect

a quick counter offer.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I need two days. Wait two days

before getting back to them. If

they call, tell them it's a big

number, I'm thinking about it.

NANCY

Okay.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

And the picture he wanted...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

... tell him I couldn't find it.

EMMA

Earl... Earl...

MR. BROOKS

(sleepy, groggy)

Huh?...

(CONTINUED)

98.

EMMA

Roger is on the phone.

JANE

Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you'd

already be gone.

MR. BROOKS

Roger called. There was another

murder last night near Stanford.

JANE

Oh...

MR. BROOKS

Done the same way as the one they

talked to you about. Right down to

the hatchet being left at the

scene.

MR. BROOKS

They think they have a serial

killer. Obviously you were here

last night, so you're in the clear.

JANE

That's good news, isn't it? I mean

even if you're innocent it's good

news to know you're not a suspect.

MR. BROOKS

Oh, yeah. How's the morning

sickness? Do you want to ride in

with me today?

JANE

I feel fine, but I don't know how

long that will last.

(CONTINUED)

99.

MR. BROOKS

Do you love me, Jane?

JANE

Of course I love you, daddy, you're

my father.

MR. BROOKS

Have you decided whether or not to

keep the baby?

JANE

Not yet.

MR. BROOKS

(nods)

Okay.

SNYDER

What are we doing?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

'Are we there yet?' , are we there

yet?' , you sound like a child.

We're playing a hunch.

SNYDER

We've been following this guy all

day, he's boring, and everything we

run on him comes up clean.

(CONTINUED)

100.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

If it didn't, it wouldn't be called

a hunch.

SNYDER

Meeks' finger-prints were all over

the chiropractor, the note,

refrigerator, he's the guy we

should be looking for.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Look where? Please tell me.

Everyone knows who Meeks is and is

looking for him. The chiropractor

was the last link to his old life

that I know of. The only way we'll

find him, now, is if someone turns

him in or we trip over him at a bus

stop. On the other hand, Detective

Snyder, no one knows who the

Thumbprint Killer is or where he

is. However, I have a fucking hunch

this guy Baffert does. I have two

days to play that hunch. If you

feel like you're wasting your time

with me, I'd be happy to do it

alone.

SNYDER

I had a fight with my wife this

morning; what's your problem?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

My husband wants five million

dollars.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Bad news?

(CONTINUED)

101.

SNYDER

Lister is pulling you off this

case.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Why?!

SNYDER

Maybe they caught him.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

No. She would have said that.

SNYDER

You want to keep following him?

SNYDER

Lister only said you were off the

case, not me.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(smiles)

Good thinking, Tonto.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Shit! She just 86'ed you too.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Is she in?

SECRETARY

She's with someone.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Good.

(CONTINUED)

102.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You promised if I settled my

divorce I had three days on the

Thumbprint Killer. I have the rest

of today and tomorrow left.

CAPTAIN LISTER

Detective Atwood, meet FBI Agents

Longnecker and Campbell, they're

taking over your investigation.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You promised you would keep them

out of it for three days.

CAPTAIN LISTER

They won't allow me to keep that

promise.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

This is my case, what you're doing

is fucked. But since I can't stop

you, and she won't, here's a tip.

James Baffert, you should stake him

out, he knows something.

DETECTIVE LONGNECKER

We have some other ideas we are

looking into.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Then what's the problem? You do

that and I'll tail Baffert.

DETECTIVE LONGNECKER

Thank you for all your good work,

Detective. This is our case now.

(CONTINUED)

103.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Good luck.

(to Captain Lister)

Later I suppose you'll fill me in

on what I'm supposed to be doing

around here. I'm confused.

MARSHALL

It's time to go.

MR. BROOKS

Yeah.

MARSHALL

Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I

have a terminal illness and instead

of subjecting you to my

deterioration, I have decided to

disappear. Don't try to find me, I

don't want to be found. Please

believe that the time I spent with

you brought me the greatest joy of

my life. Love. Dad.

MARSHALL

So you're going to go through with

it.

(CONTINUED)

104.

MR. BROOKS

It's all planned to work out,

Marshall.

MR. BROOKS

(smiles)

Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr.

Smith?

MARSHALL

I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's

different than yours.

MR. BROOKS

He brought his gun. After he gets

what he wants he plans to kill me.

MARSHALL

Ah... now I get it. You were

counting on that, weren't you?

MR. BROOKS

It has a certain logic.

MARSHALL

But if your plan is to have him

kill you, why do you have to kill

someone else first?

(CONTINUED)

105.

MR. BROOKS

He'll need to see that to get up

the courage to kill me.

MARSHALL

Not even you believe that, Earl. It

makes it more exciting, doesn't it,

to think he's going to kill you

after you kill someone else. You're

getting your rocks off big time,

that's why you're doing it.

MR. BROOKS

Not true... and if it were, so

what?

(to Mr. Smith)

You're goddamn great, you know. To

have the balls to do this.

MR. SMITH

I'm pretty nervous but that's

normal right?

MR. BROOKS

Perfectly normal.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Hello... Oh, yes, yes.

(she sits up)

Put him through... Hi, this is

Detective Atwood speaking, thanks

for calling...Yes, your roommate

said you were in Tokyo... Anything,

if you saw anything at all it might

be helpful.

(CONTINUED)

106.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

The weird thing is that they closed

their curtains, at first they were

open like they always were and they

were making love, which they always

did, and then when I looked again

the curtains were closed, and there

were what looked like camera

flashes coming from behind the

curtains.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Camera flashes?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

That's what it looked like.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(almost to herself)

That's why he poses them.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

I'm sorry?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Nothing.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

I wish I could be more helpful, I

didn't see the killer or anything

like that, but since it was weird I

thought I should call.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You've been very helpful. This

answers a lot of questions for me.

Thank you very much, Mr. Struber.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

The guy you should talk to is the

guy on the floor below us...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

107.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

eh, I can't remember his name, but

he told me once that he'd taken

some great pictures of that Couple

making love, he's the one you

should speak to.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Would that be, Mr. Baffert?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Yeah, I think Jim or James...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Thank you very much.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Snyder, meet me at Baffert's

apartment with a Search Warrant...

Listen to me, this is what you tell

the judge.

MR. BROOKS

Put these on.

MR. BROOKS

Try a couple deep breaths through

your nose.

(CONTINUED)

108.

MR. SMITH

I have to take a crap so bad.

MR. BROOKS

This won't take long.

SHEILA

I called your wife's lawyer.

They're thinking about the five

million dollars.

JESSE

Realistically how much do you think

we can get?

(CONTINUED)

109.

SHEILA

If we go to court, best case, two,

if she wants to settle, best case,

three, but I would be happy with

two seven.

JESSE

I'll be right back.

JESSE

I think we should hold firm for

three.

SHEILA

Let's not be piggish, two five, two

seven, would be a good deal.

SHEILA

(teasing)

You've already had half a bottle.

JESSE

You're late; if we want it, there's

more.

SHEILA

To us.

JESSE

To three million dollars.

(CONTINUED)

110.

SHEILA

(after a sip)

We have to do this fast because

remember, Marie is meeting us here.

JESSE

We could ask her to join us.

SHEILA

Not funny.

JESSE

(undoing the front of her

bra)

I wasn't trying to be.

SHEILA

Are we alone?

JESSE

Yeah.

MR. BROOKS

Don't do that.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Mr. Baffert?... Mr. Baffert?

OLDER WOMAN

He's gone.

(CONTINUED)

111.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Do you have any idea when he'll be

back?

OLDER WOMAN

He skipped out. I heard him leave

this evening and a few minutes

later there were Movers here. Musta

been behind on the rent. He didn't

even say good-bye.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Thank you.

OLDER WOMAN

I told you.

(CONTINUED)

112.

MAN

Obviously Baffert's gone...

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(overlapping)

Goddamit, Snyder. Knock.

SNYDER

I wasn't able to get the search

warrant.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

We may have gotten lucky.

(holding up the paper)

This is the Moving Company's work

order and...

(points))

... it looks like this is the

address where they're taking

Baffert's stuff.

SNYDER

Where were you when you called me?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

At home in bed.

SNYDER

Can you prove that?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I was home in bed, why should I

have to prove that?

SNYDER

Your husband Jesse and his lawyer

were killed tonight...

SNYDER

It looks like the Thumbprint

Killer, I've been ordered to bring

you in for questioning.

(CONTINUED)

113.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Why, I didn't want Jesse dead, I

loved him, I hated what he was

doing to me...

SNYDER

It's on record you said you'd like

him dead and who better to fake a

Thumbprint killing than you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You can't actually believe I would

do that.

SNYDER

If our jobs have taught us

anything, Tracy, is that people do

strange things. They just want to

ask you some questions.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I will be happy to answer any

questions after we check out this

address.

SNYDER

I have to take you in, Tracy.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(waves the paper)

This is the answer to the

Thumbprint Killer, Snyder, and this

is where I'm going and you're not

going to stop me.

SNYDER

Don't make me cuff you, Tracy,

because I will if I have to.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I believe you would.

SNYDER

(smiles back)

You can count on it.

(CONTINUED)

114.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(standing over him)

It would be nice if you could come

with me, but if you do and it goes

bad, they'll burn your ass. So this

never happened.

MR. SMITH

That was great! It was fantastic!

It was everything I hoped it would

be. Thank you.

MR. BROOKS

You're welcome.

MARSHALL

Here comes the gun.

MR. BROOKS

Yup.

MR. BROOKS

(feigns surprise)

What are you doing?!

MR. SMITH

You're smart enough to figure that

out, Mr. Brooks.

MR. BROOKS

Well we're going sixty five miles

an hour, Mr. Smith, if you shoot me

now, there's a good chance we'll

both die.

(CONTINUED)

115.

MR. SMITH

Not now. Take the next off ramp.

MR. BROOKS

That wouldn't be very smart of me

would it?

MR. BROOKS

(matter of fact)

Think about this. You pissed

yourself back there, you left your

DNA at the scene of a double

homicide, and there's nothing to

indicate that I was ever there. If

the Cops do an analysis of that

urine, and they will, you're the

Thumbprint Killer.

MR. SMITH

(smug)

No. I still have pictures of you

doing the first murder.

MR. BROOKS

Yes. But what were you doing at the

second murder?

MR. BROOKS

Let me help you with a thought. You

say I forced you to come along and

if I'm not here or more

specifically my body is not here to

say different, you might have a

chance to beat the rap. Now you're

probably asking yourself why I

would help you. I'm tired, Mr.

Smith, I'm tired of killing. But

I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've

tried. I can't do it on my own. So

I'll let you kill me but I want you

to do it smart, in a way that I

disappear and my family never knows

what I was.

(CONTINUED)

116.

MR. SMITH

How do I do that?

MR. BROOKS

There's a cemetery I know about. We

find an open grave, you shoot me, I

fall in the grave, you shovel in

just enough earth to cover me,

tomorrow a casket is lowered onto

me and I've disappeared. It's a

good plan. What do you say?...

MR. SMITH

Why should I trust you?

MR. BROOKS

You don't have to trust me. You're

the man holding the gun, you saw me

put mine in the trunk.

MR. SMITH

I don't know. You really want me to

kill you?

MR. BROOKS

Yes.

MR. SMITH

Okay... But any sudden moves and

you're dead on the spot and I'll

make sure your family knows what

you are.

MR. BROOKS

I understand.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(to herself, regarding the

Building)

You've come down in the world, Mr.

Baffert.

(CONTINUED)

117.

MR. SMITH

Uh uh, take your hand out real

slow.

MR. BROOKS

It's locked. You don't want to

climb over, do you?

MR. SMITH

What are you doing with a key to a

cemetery?

MR. BROOKS

I own it.

MR. SMITH

Why do you own a cemetery?

MR. BROOKS

You always want to invest in things

people can't do without. Water and

cemeteries are pretty safe.

(CONTINUED)

118.

MR. BROOKS

You'll need this to get out. Now

there should be an open grave

around here somewhere. Let's see if

we can find it.

(CONTINUED)

119.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Meeks?!!

(CONTINUED)

120.

MEEKS

(calls out)

Atwood?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Yeah.

MEEKS

Come on down, there's something I

want to show you.

MR. BROOKS

There we are. Now if I stand

here...

MR. BROOKS

... and you stand there, not too

far away and you shoot me, I should

fall straight back into the hole.

(CONTINUED)

121.

MR. SMITH

You don't think I have the guts to

do this do you?

MR. BROOKS

I'm hoping you do.

MR. BROOKS

Okay, let's get this over with.

MR. BROOKS

I'll close my eyes.

MR. BROOKS

I'm sorry.

MR. BROOKS

I really did want you to kill me.

But in case at the last minute I

changed my mind, I returned to your

apartment and bent the firing pin

on your gun.

MR. BROOKS

In fact I even brought another gun

for you so you could finish me if I

had decided to go through with it.

(CONTINUED)

122.

MR. BROOKS

Unfortunately for you, my daughter

is pregnant and just before you

pulled the trigger, I realized how

much I want to see the end to that

story.

MR. SMITH

(dry mouth)

If you do anything to me, if you

touch one hair on my head, the

Police will find the pictures of

you killing that Couple.

MR. BROOKS

The contents of your safety deposit

box, Mr. Smith, have vanished.

MR. BROOKS

(looking down at the

corpse)

Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,

Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people

in a lot of different ways.

123.

MARSHALL

It says here the Thumbprint Killer

is a monster... annoys you a little

bit that you can't take credit,

doesn't it?

MR. BROOKS

Anyone who is good at what they do,

wants recognition. But since I'm

not going to do it anymore, I'll

let Mr. Smith take the credit.

MARSHALL

Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're

going to kill again.

MR. BROOKS

No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA

meetings and I'll control it.

MR. BROOKS

But there is an answer I would like

to have.

124.

OFFICER

Good work, Atwood.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Thanks, Tom.

ANOTHER OFFICER

You should ask the FBI to kiss your

ass and buy you a Cadillac.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I like my ass too much for that.

SNYDER

This is bogus. The company doesn't

exist in the city, the state, the

United States or Canada.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

So the whole point of this piece of

paper was to give me Meeks.

SNYDER

That's what it looks like.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Why? Who moved him, where did they

move him to, and why did he give me

Meeks?

SNYDER

That's what we get paid to find

out.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

I'm going to go to the bathroom and

think about this.

(CONTINUED)

125.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Detective Atwood...

MR. BROOKS

Why are you a cop?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Who is this?

MR. BROOKS

You're rich, you have a good

education, you could have gone into

your father's business, instead you

went outside all of that and became

successful on your own. Why?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You want something from me if you

don't tell me who you are I'm going

to hang up.

MR. BROOKS

Did you think your husband's

killing was random and I certainly

didn't have to give you Meeks.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Mr. Baffert?!

MR. BROOKS

What's the answer?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

You don't sound like you.

MR. BROOKS

I have a little cold. Are you going

to give me the answer?

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Where are you?

(CONTINUED)

126.

MR. BROOKS

I'll tell you if you can give me

the true answer to my question.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

My father was very disappointed I

was born a girl and he let me know

that. I've spent my whole life

trying to prove him wrong.

MR. BROOKS

Thank you.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Wait. You promised to tell me where

you are.

MR. BROOKS

Me? I'm on top of a building.

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Why would he be interested in that?

127.

MR. BROOKS

Agghhh!!! Agghhh!!!

EMMA (V.O.)

Honey, Earl, Earl...

EMMA

Wake up, wake up...

EMMA

You were having a nightmare.

MR. BROOKS

(breathing hard)

Oh... I woke you up.

EMMA

It's okay.

EMMA (CONT'D)

I'm here, go back to sleep, I'm

here.

(CONTINUED)

128.

MR. BROOKS

... that I may be reasonably happy

in this life, And supremely happy

with Him forever in the next. Amen.

.... God grant me the Serenity to

accept...

THE END
