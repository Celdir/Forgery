AS GOOD AS IT GETSAS GOOD AS IT GETS

SWEET-FACED WOMAN

I'm just going to get some

flowers, dear. I'll be back in

twenty minutes. It's tulip season

today. I'm so happy.

MELVIN

Come here, sweetheart... come on.

MELVIN

Wanna go for a ride? Okay,

sweetie?

MELVIN

(a malevolent tone)

You've pissed your last floor, you

dog-eared monkey.

MELVIN

I'll bet you wish you were some

sort of real dog now, huh? Don't

worry...  this is New York. If you

can make it here, you can make it

anywhere, you know? You ugly,

smelly fuck.

SIMON

Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...

SIMON

Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey

there!

(as Melvin turns)

Have you seen Verdell?

MELVIN

What's he look like?

SIMON

My dog... you know... I mean my

little dog with the adorable

face... Don't you know what my dog

looks like?

MELVIN

I got it. You're talking about

your dog. I thought that was the

name of the colored man I've been

seeing in the hall.

SIMON

Which color was that?

MELVIN

Like thick molasses, with one of

those wide noses perfect for

smelling trouble and prison

food...

SIMON

Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

MELVIN

(not missing a beat)

How're you doing?

SIMON

Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I

think you know that.

FRANK

(overlapping)

Simon, you've got to get dressed.

MELVIN

(to Simon)

What I know is that as long as you

keep your work zipped up around

me, I don't give a fuck what or

where you shove your show. Are we

being neighbors for now?

SIMON

(to Frank)

Do you still think I was

exaggerating?

FRANK

Definitely a package you don't

want to open or touch.

MELVIN

Hope you find him. I love that

dog.

SIMON

(directly)

You don't love anything, Mr.

Udall.

MELVIN

I love throwing your dog down the

garbage chute.

SIMON

Thank the good Lord... wow... my

honey... where have you been?

PARTY GOER

(thinking the greeting's

for him)

He always liked me.

SIMON

Just for a second, okay?

SIMON

(kissing him on the mouth)

Look at him...  where was little

baby?

HANDYMAN

(smiling)

In the basement garbage bin eating

diaper shit.

SIMON

Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.

(looking at Verdell)

How did he get down in the

basement? I mean even if he got

on the elevator how... ?

HANDYMAN

Maybe some nice neighbor shoved

him down the garbage chute.

SIMON

My God! No!

MELVIN

'Somewhat in the dark, she had

confessed and he had forgiven.

This is what you live for, he

said. Two heads on a pillow where

there is only the safety of being

with each other. How, she

wondered, could she find such hope

in the most shameful part of her.'

SIMON (O.S.)

Mr. Udall.

MELVIN

'At last she was able to define

love. Love was... '

SIMON (O.S.)

Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you

please.

MELVIN

'Love was... '

MELVIN

... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-

stool-pusher.

MELVIN

(loud and angry)

Yeeeess!!!

SIMON

Maybe this can wait.

SIMON

I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

MELVIN

Well, that's a load off.

SIMON

Did you... do something to him?

MELVIN

Do you realize that I work at

him?

SIMON

(eyes downcast)

No, I didn't.

MELVIN

Do you like to be interrupt when

you are danging around in your

little garden?

SIMON

No...  actually, I even shut the

phone off and put a little piece

of cardboard in the ringer so no

one can just buzz me from d...

MELVIN

Well, I work all the time. So

never, never again interrupt me.

Okay? I mean, never. Not 30

years from now... not if there's

fire. Not even if you hear a thud

from inside my home and a week

later there's a smell from in

there that can only come from a

decaying body and you have to hold

a hanky against your face because

the stench is so thick you think

you're going to faint even then

don't come knocking or, if it's

election night and you're excited

and want to celebrate because some

fudge-packer you dated has been

elected the first queer President

of the United States... and he's

going to put you up in Camp David

and you just want to share the

moment with someone...  don't knock

...  not on this door. Not for

anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

SIMON

Yes. It's not a subtle point

you're making.

MELVIN

Okay, then.

SIMON

So the theory of confrontations is

that now he'll think twice before

messing with me?

SIMON

He's genuinely upsetting, isn't

he?

FRANK

Won't worry about it. You go

ahead.

MELVIN (O.S.)

Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really

pissed!!!

MELVIN

No touch. No touch. No touch.

FRANK

You may think you can intimidate

the whole world with your

attitude, but I grew up in Hell.

My grandmother had more attitude.

You don't intimidate me.

MELVIN

(calling)

Police! Police! Fucking crooked

police...  doughnut-munching morons

help me!

(to Frank)

Assault and battery and you're

black.

FRANK

Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like

him enough to batter you

unrecognizable if you verbally

abuse him or so much as touch his

dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try

and think how you can make this up

to him.

(suddenly loud)

I hate doing this. I'm an art

dealer.

(beat)

Have a nice day. Party!

CAROL

(to the Mother's

little girl)

Look at you, you're all better.

MOTHER

It's that new medication.

CAROL

You know all my son's stuff,

right?

CAROL

No, no, no, I got a date tonight.

I'm walking out the door this

morning and he says to me, 'Mom,

I promise not to get one of my

fevers or coughs during your

date.'

MOTHER

Isn't that sweet.

CAROL

Little blonde angle.

(to child,

affectionately)

Eat everything.

WOMAN

It just came out of me. I said

you love me the way a remote

control loves a TV. As long as I

switch every time...

HER MALE COMPANION

Wonderful.

MELVIN

People who talk in metaphors can

shampoo my crotch.

(on their look)

Eat up.

LISA

Pay me back next week.

CAROL

I owe you. I told you today...

them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,

Melvin.

MELVIN

I'm starving.

CAROL

(firmly to Lisa)

Will you please take it?

LISA

This way you take a cab home so

you have time to get ready for the

date.

CAROL

"Ready" is not my problem.

CAROL

(to Melvin)

Go sit down. You know you're not

allowed back here...  Spencer's

more excited about it than I am...

He says, "Mom, I promise not to

get a fever or couch during your date."

CAROL

I know. He's just the best.

MELVIN

I've got Jews at my table.

CAROL

It's not your table. It's the

place's table. Behave. This

once, you can sit at someone

else's station.

CAROL

Or you can just wait your turn...

MELVIN

How much more you got to eat?

Your appetite isn't as big as

your noses, is it?

WOMAN

What?!!

MAN

(to Woman)

Let's go --

MAN

Let's leave. We're going.

CAROL

Bryan says he doesn't care how

long you've been coming you ever

act like this again you're barred

for life. I'm gonna miss the

excitement, but I'll handle it.

MELVIN

The table's fine if it had some

cholesterol on it. Two sausages,

six bacon strips, fries, three

eggs over easy and coffee.

CAROL

You're gonna die soon with that

diet, you know that?

MELVIN

We're all gonna die soon. I will.

You will. It sure sounds like

your son will.

CAROL

If you ever mention my son again,

you will never be able to eat here

again. Do you understand? Give me

some sign you understand or leave

now. Do you understand me...

(adds truthful label)

you crazy freak? Do you?!?

CAROL

Okay. I'll get your order.

YOUNG MAN

What?

CAROL

I...  I...  I don't know...  You got

me.

CAROL

Let me just do whatever I do by

myself...  I'll catch up to you

someplace I promise.

(as he's put off)

Oh, no...  don't look like that.

No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

CAROL

Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

SPENCER (O.S.)

(softly)

Grandma, grandma...

YOUNG MAN

Maybe you better check.

CAROL

Like what did you think I was

going to do?

BEVERLY

I'm sorry. I was hearing just

everything you were doing so I put

these on to give you privacy.

SPENCER

I'm sorry.

CAROL

Don't be silly. How bad?

SPENCER

Not bad.

CAROL

(a bit panicked)

You can't smoke...  He can't take

smoke.

CAROL

Oh, God...  I don't even notice

anymore.

CAROL

That'll teach you.

YOUNG MAN

Don't apologize.

CAROL

(perturbed)

That wasn't an apology.

CAROL

Hey...  this is just a little throw-

up -- it's nothing to be so

embarrassed about. Really.

(as he shifts

uncomfortably)

Thanks for the dinner. Let me

write down which trains you take

to get back.

YOUNG MAN

No way.

YOUNG MAN

I'll take a cab.

YOUNG MAN

Too much reality for a Friday

night.

EVAN

Why is every customer surprised I

read books?

DOUG

(amazed)

You read books?

EVAN

Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look!

He even bought me dinner.

CARL

(slightly exasperated)

Look, I just can't. I promised

Simon I'd find him a model.

FRIEND (V.O.)

(on speaker phone,

flirting)

Carl, take me off the speaker.

Did I tell you that these are

house seats? C'mon, you could use

a break. Hello...  Carl, are you

there...  hello?

CARL

.		...  I just found a model.

DOUG

(to Carl)

Hey, how it's goin'...

EVAN

Hey, hi...  remember?

CARL

I only need one.

EVAN

You picked me up, maybe a few

weeks, I don't know, some time

ago. You were very flattering

about our...  encounter.

CARL

Maybe just you and me...  but this

is for a painting. I need a

pretty face.

SIMON

Sorry, I was out in the studio

doing some work and I forgot about

our appointment.

SIMON

I usually make such a big deal out

of picking models but Carl's so

thorough. I'll bet he drove you

nuts checking your references.

SIMON

(taken aback)

This isn't a nude.

VINCENT

Just kidding around.

(then mutters)

So much for love.

SIMON

Exactly what is your previous

experience?

VINCENT

How about that pose?

(sing-song)

This is not fun...

(then)

Give me some direction.

SIMON

Nothing. I just watch till

something strikes me. Do anything

you think of -- try different

thing. Until I say, "hold that

pose." Then just try and

comfortably hold it.

VINCENT

(trying another space)

The fact that you haven't said,

"hold it" means I haven't done it

right...  is that correct? I

haven't done it right?

SIMON

No...  Okay. What I do is watch

and wait for, um... You ever watch

someone who doesn't know you're

watching...  an old woman on a bus,

kids going to school and you see

this flash come over them and you

know immediately that it has

nothing to do with anything

external -- that it's in respond

to a private thought they just

had? They are just sort of realer

and more alive. And when you

notice it so are you. If you look

at someone long enough, you

discover their humanity.

VINCENT

I know exactly what you mean.

SIMON

Hold it.

MELVIN

Clippity clop -- clippity clop --

she has to pretend she doesn't

hear me. Listening to the story

from the upset friend...  now she

drops off the cappuccino and

smiles at the putzette who doesn't

even say, "Thank you." No, the

putzette wanted the whipped cream

so back she goes and now she has

to pass him again and it's getting

tougher to make believe.

CAROL

(reluctant forgiveness)

Okay.

CAROL

What's with the plastic picnic

ware? Why not try ours...  afraid

it isn't clean?

MELVIN

I see the help -- judgement call.

CAROL

Just give yourself a little pep

talk. "Must try other people's

clean silverware as part of the

fun of dining out."

MELVIN

What's wrong with your son,

anyway?

CAROL

What do you care?

CAROL

He's gotta fight to breathe.

His asthma can just shoot off the

charts -- he's allergic to dust

and this is New York and his

immune system bails on him when

there's trouble so an ear

infection...  Is this bothering

you?

MELVIN

(caught)

No.

CAROL

An ear infection can send us to

the emergency room -- maybe five,

six times a month where I get

whatever nine-year-old they just

made a doctor. Nice chatting with

you.

MELVIN

His name?

CAROL

Spencer.

MELVIN

Okay.

CAROL

(quietly)

Spence.

SIMON

You can put on anything you want

now. I might be sort of done

here...

DOUG

Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

VINCENT

So you're practically finished,

huh?

SIMON

Yes...  well, there's one more

stage -- trying to figure out if

it's any good.

VINCENT

Wait -- I want to see the

painting.

SIMON

Just a second -- he has to go.

VINCENT

Please!! NO!!!

SIMON

(to Vincent)

What's the matter, sweetheart?

DOUG

Yo.

SIMON

Why are you doing this?

VINCENT

No. No. No. Hey, that painting

in there...  I just want to tell

you...

EVAN

(to Vincent)

What are you doing? Cruising him?

RAY

Okay. So you call 911 and don't

leave your name -- even a dumb

geezer should know that emergency

automatically pulls up your name.

How come you make a mistake like

that?

MELVIN

How come you're pretending to do

cop work -- 'cause I don't think

you could find your ass if you

were spotted the hole.

RAY

(stunned)

What?

MELVIN

Just move on. No one here killed

him.

RAY

Oh, is he dead?

MELVIN

Ask him.

RAY

We will if we can and if we can't,

we'll come back and ask you again

and again.

SWEET-FACED WOMAN

I've been praying for him since I

heard.

FRANK

So I've got to get to the

hospital. If you could take the

dog just for tonight.

SWEET-FACED WOMAN

Oh, Lord -- I've got all these

antique knick-knacks...  Or else

I'd be glad...

FRANK

Maybe if you kept locked in

the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.

(as he turns away and she

closes the door he adds)

Old bitch...  Damn dog.

FRANK

You're taking him...  yes...  you're

taking him -- this will clear the

books. One night. You want to

say "no" to me? Try...  because

I've never felt as nuts as I do

right this second. I almost want

you to try saying "no."

MELVIN

(quietly)

I'm not saying nothing to you.

FRANK

Thanks for looking after him.

MELVIN (O.S.)

Hey, where are you going? You

can't do this.

(calls after Frank)

I can't take a dog.

(a confession)

Nobody's ever been in here before.

FRANK (O.S.)

(threatening)

You don't want to mess with me

today. I'll figure something else

out tomorrow.

MELVIN

You're dead!!

MELVIN

I don't have dog food. And I

won't want dog food here. You'll

eat what we have. You'll eat what

we eat.

MELVIN

Don't you touch anything.

FRANK

(into phone)

Put the solid red dots on three of

them and the hold blue dots on two

others...  Well, we're not going to

sell anything if they know we're

two weeks into a show and have no

sales. No, you can't reduce a

price at this stage...  We're in

free fall here. Any calls?

JACKIE

We can see him.

FRANK

I'll meet you in there.

JACKIE

How you doing, great one?

SIMON

I haven't looked at myself yet. I

figured I could tell from your

reaction.

SIMON

That bad, huh?

FRANK

Hey, hey...

(as he sees him)

Haaa...  bad but temporary. The

nurses say it's much better than

you looked three weeks ago...  the

hand will come back...  they're

sure...

SIMON

Jackie, will you hand me the

mirror?

JACKIE

(a small voice)

No.

JACKIE

Wait, I have a smaller one.

SIMON

So, what's new anyway? How's

Verdell?

FRANK

(sheepish)

Your neighbor -- Udall -- is

taking care of him.

SIMON

(suddenly alive and upset)

How could you do that? He'll hurt

him.

FRANK

No, I promise...  not a chance. I

own this guy. There was no one

else. I'm on the move too much.

Trust me.

SIMON

You are very certain my dog is

okay...  because you have no

idea...

FRANK

Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

SIMON

Okay, waiting gives the devil

time. Now!

SIMON

Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

CAROL

So what are you doing with a dog?

MELVIN

Suckered in. Set up. Pushed

around.

CAROL

You're not worried that someone

might take him?

MELVIN

Well, not until now -- for

Christ's sake.

CAROL

Sorry.

MELVIN

It's okay -- I'll sit here.

CAROL

You know he's a little dog. Next

time, if Bryan's not here, you can

bring him in.

MELVIN

How old are you?

CAROL

Oh, please...

MELVIN

If I had to guess by your eyes,

I'd say you were fifty.

CAROL

And if I had to guess by your

eyes. I'd say you were kind. So,

so much for eyes. But as long as

you bring up age...  how old are

you?

MELVIN

(quickly)

Otherwise, you're not ugly.

CAROL

(laughs out loud)

Okay, pal...  I accept the

compliment, but go easy -- my

knees start a-knocking when you

turn on the charm full blast.

MELVIN

What's with the dark?

CAROL

Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol.

My son had a full blown attack.

And this time, for extra fun, they

gave us the wrong antibiotics, so

I get him home...

MELVIN

No...  no...  leave it...  the

bacon's for the dog.

MELVIN

Last week I was playing the piano

for him and he likes it, and so I

decide I'm going to make a little

joke...

CAROL

You all set here?

MELVIN

It's a beautiful day for our walk.

MELVIN

Don't be like me, don't you be

like me. You stay just the way

you are because you are a perfect

man. I'm gonna take you home and

get you something to eat...  what

you love.

FEMALE PASSERSBY

(charmed)

Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like

that.

MELVIN

(all smiles to Verdell)

Let's go home and do some writing.

MELVIN

"He turned off the gas jets and

carried her outside. He kissed

her brow and when her eyes opened

and found him, he said, 'there are

easier ways to break a date.' She

laughed. The only sensible

ambition he had ever known was now

realized. He had made the girl

happy. And what a girl. 'You've

saved my life,' she said, 'you'd

better make it up to me.'"

MELVIN

(singing to Verdell)

Done!

(playing with him some)

Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I

hate the doggy.

MELVIN (V.O.)

Sixty-two books... done!

FRANK

How's Verdell doing?

MELVIN

He's a pain in the ass.

FRANK

Simon's home. I was sort of

hoping you could keep the dog

until he's had a chance to think

and adjust...

MELVIN

(leaping at the chance)

It's been five weeks...  another

few won't kill me.

FRANK

No. He wants him back. He'll be

by tomorrow.

MELVIN

(too loudly, weirdly)

Okay by me.

MELVIN

That's some face they left hanging

on you. You look like...

SIMON

(interrupting)

Could you take it just a little

easy, Mr. Udall?

SIMON

Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?

(to Melvin)

By the way, thanks for saving me.

MELVIN

I called. I never touched you. I

didn't leave my name or nothing.

SIMON

(not listening)

Verdell?

SIMON

Hi, sweetheart.

SIMON

No. Please, don't force him.

JACKIE

(to dog)

You little stinker. He's given

you everything.

MELVIN

Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

MELVIN

Worst sidewalk in New York and

look where they put in.

MELVIN

Help!

DOCTOR

If you want to see me you will not

do this. You will make an

appointment...

MELVIN

Explain to me how you can diagnose

someone as "obsessive compulsive

disorder" and then act like I have

any choice in barging in.

DOCTOR

There's not going to be a debate.

You must leave.

MELVIN

You said you could help me --

what was that -- a tease?

DOCTOR

I can help you if you take the

responsibility to keep regular

app --

MELVIN

(suddenly)

You changed the room around...

DOCTOR

Two years ago...

DOCTOR

I also regrew my beard...  but

you're not interested in changes

in me... so it's like I always

told you...  when it comes to

people you...

MELVIN

Shhhhhhh. I don't have this

mountain of available time...  I

got to get to my restaurant on

time. Do you know how hard it is

for me to be here?

DOCTOR

Yes.

(as Melvin starts

for the office)

No.

MELVIN

(to other patients)

What if this is as good as it

gets?

CHERYL

What the heck are those for?

MELVIN

No. No. Get Carol.

CHERYL

I'm filling in. We don't know if

she's coming back. She might have

to get a job closer to home.

MELVIN

What are you trying to do to me?

CHERYL

What the heck do you mean?

MELVIN

Hey, elephant girl, call her or

something...  just let her do my

one meal here. I'll pay whatever.

I'll wait.

(as she doesn't

budge; he screams)

Do it!!!

MANAGER

Out. Be silent or leave.

MELVIN

I'll be quiet. Just let me wait.

No problem. Get her here -- have

her get me two sausages, four

bacon, two eggs over easy and

coffee. I'm not a prick here --

I'm a great customer. This day is

a disaster. I can't handle this,

too.

MANAGER

Get out immediately or there's

going to be trouble.

MELVIN

There's going to be trouble???

MELVIN

Carol's last name?

BUSBOY

Connelly.

MELVIN

I'm hungry.

(on Carol's astonished

look)

You've upset my whole day. I

haven't eaten.

CAROL

What are you doing here?

MELVIN

This is not a sexist thing. If

you were a waiter I would still be

here saying...

CAROL

Are you totally gone? This is my

private home...

MELVIN

I am trying to keep emotions out of

this. Even though this is an

important issue to me and I have

strong feelings about the subject.

CAROL

What subject? That I wasn't there

to take crap from you and bring

you eggs? Do you have any control

over how creepy you allow yourself

to get?

MELVIN

Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...

and to prove it I have not gotten

personal and you have. Why aren't

you at work? You're not sick --

you don't look sick... just very

tired and bitter.

CAROL

My son is sick, okay?

MELVIN

What about your mother?

CAROL

How do you know about my mother?

MELVIN

I hear you talk when I'm

waiting!!!

CAROL

Sorry, honey...  I'll be right

there.

MELVIN

(uncomfortably)

How ya doing?

MELVIN

(miffed)

You should answer when someone

talks to you...

CAROL

Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin,

and I can't handle you teaching

my son manners.

CAROL AND SPENCER

5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

SPENCER

104.9

CAROL

We are going to treat ourselves to

a cab ride.

CAROL

Melvin, wait!

SCHOOL KIDS

Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!

Melvin, wait!

MELVIN

Shut up, kids!

CAROL

Melvin...  give us a lift. We've

got to go see our friends at the

hospital.

MELVIN

I'll ride up front. Cover your

mouth when you cough, kid.

CAROL

Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,

please and quickly please.

CAROL

(calling back)

I owe you three dollars.

MELVIN

Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll

get back to work today?

CAROL

(furiously)

No!!! Stay away from me!

JACKIE

I feel terrible that I have to...

Simon? Forget about the dog for a

second.

SIMON

Sorry. What are those cards?

JACKIE

(a bit embarrassed)

Frank's idea. He thought I should

have notes so I did this right...

maintained focus, didn't get

emotional and tried not to terrify

you.

SIMON

(scared shitless)

Terrify me?

JACKIE

See, he's right. I need the

cards.

(reading from cards)

Simon, you're broke.

JACKIE (O.S.)

The medical bill are 61 thousand

now. I've spoken to your parents

and they didn't hang up or

anything -- they just said they

would feel strange calling you.

SIMON (O.S.)

Well, I can't reach them.

SIMON

(to Verdell)

Here, baby...  what is it,

Verdell?...  You miss the tough

guy...

(trying to be

Melvin-like)

Well, here I am, you little pissant

mop, happy to see me? How about

another ride down the chute? Oh,

God...  I don't mean it,

sweetheart...

(on Jackie's look)

I'm sorry. I know...

JACKIE

Frank loves you. You know that...

but I've spoken to him and he

feels that --

(reading from card)

-- as a businessman, with limited

resources...

SIMON

I'll be able to keep my apartment

and studio, won't I?...  Just tell

me.

SIMON

(overwhelmed)

Wow...

FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

Yes, you write more than anyone

else. Yes, you make us a lot of

money, but isn't there someone

more appropriate to...

MELVIN (O.S.)

I need this. Just say, "Melvin,

I'll try," okay?

FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)

(resigned)

Melvin, I'll try.

FEMALE EXECUTIVE

Now, on a pleasant note, our son

got accepted at Brown. My

husband...

MELVIN

(curtly)

Great, wonderful. I don't need

you to wait with me.

ZOE

I can't resist. You usually move

through here so quickly and I have

so many questions I want to ask

you. You have no idea what your

work means to me.

MELVIN

What's it mean?

ZOE

That somebody out there knows what

it's like to be...

(taps her head and heart)

in here.

MELVIN

Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

ZOE

Aw come on, just a couple of

questions -- how hard is that?

ZOE

How do you write women so well?

MELVIN

(as he turns

toward her)

I think of a man and take away

reason and accountability.

CAROL

Hello? Hello?

VOICE (O.S.)

Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

CAROL

What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

DR. BETTES

Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes

...  Dr. Bettes.

CAROL

Not your name...  what are you

telling me your name for!! Where

is he?

DR. BETTES

He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

CAROL

(overlapping)

Tell me how bad it is. I let him

go out last night when it was so

cool without an overshirt -- just

and underone with just the straps

and I know better...  and I let him

talk me into it. He was whining

and...  you don't need this. Give

me a second to catch hold.

SPENCER

(to his mother)

Hi...

(they kiss)

Did you know there are doctors who

come to your house?

CAROL

No, I didn't.

(to Bettes)

So why are you h...

BEVERLY

I didn't know you had a secret

admire.

CAROL

Huh?

BEVERLY

You met the gift.

SPENCER

He's good...  And I'm an expert on

doctors.

CAROL

(to Spencer)

Stay out of this...  Doctor?

DR. BETTES

My wife is Melvin Udall's

publisher.

(as Carol reacts)

She says I have to take great care

of this guy because you're

urgently needed back at work.

What work do you do?

CAROL

I'm a waitress.

BEVERLY

In Manhattan.

VOICE (O.S.)

Dr. Bettes?

DR. BETTES

In here.

NURSE

Sorry it took so long. I don't

know Brooklyn.

DR. BETTES

It's okay, Terry.

(hands her blood

vail)

Tell the lab I'd like the report

back today.

CAROL

You're going to get the results

today?!

DR. BETTES

How long has he been having

problems?

CAROL

Since forever.

DR. BETTES

Have they done blood tests on him?

CAROL

Yes.

DR. BETTES

Only in the emergency room or when

he was well.

CAROL

Emergency room only.

DR. BETTES

Have they done skin testing for

allergies?

CAROL

No.

DR. BETTES

They haven't done the standard

scratch test. Where they make

small injections into the skin?

CAROL

No. I asked. They said it's not

covered under my plan. And it's

not necessary anyway.

DR. BETTES

It's amazing these things weren't

done.

CAROL

Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of

shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

DR. BETTES

No. Actually, I think that's

their technical name.

CAROL

Once the tests come back, is there

someone I can reach in your office

for the results?

DR. BETTES

Me. My home number is on this

card.

CAROL

His home number.

CAROL

(to doctor)

Do you want some juice or coffee

or two female slaves?

DR. BETTES

Water...  Nobody told you it might

be a good idea to remove the

carpeting and drapes in Spencer's

room?

CAROL

No.

DR. BETTES

You don't have to do it this

second...  it's not dangerous or

anything. It's just something

that's advisable. Look, there's

a lot to be checked but...  Hey,

your son is going to feel a

good deal better at the very

least...

CAROL

Doc!!!

(then)

So listen, you gotta let me know

about the additional costs -- one

way or the other we'll...

DR. BETTES

They're considerable. But Mr.

Udall wants to be billed.

NORA

You poor, poor man.

SIMON

Let's use just one poor, okay?

Anyway, dear, thanks for

everything. Forgive my recent

crankiness and as soon as things

are on track again I'll call.

SIMON

What's wrong?

NORA

Who's going to walk Verdell?

SIMON

No, no.

MELVIN

Is he dead yet?

NORA

No! Would there be any way for

you to be willing to walk his dog

for him?

MELVIN

Absolutely.

NORA

Not just today -- Uh, could you

do it -- until, until he gets

back on his feet?

MELVIN

Sure thing.

NORA

You're a wonderful man. Two

o'clock is a good time. Here's

the key in case he's asleep. Open

the curtains for him, so he sees

God's beautiful work and knows

that even things like this happen

for the best.

MELVIN

Where'd they teach you to talk

like this -- some Panama City

"Sailor want to hump-hump bar"?

Or was today getaway day and your

last shot at his whiskey. Sell

crazy some place else -- we're all

stocked up here.

CAROL

There is a seriously goofy man

behind this. You are not allowed

to block out that fact.

BEVERLY

Do you really want to go back to

the runt doctors in Emergency who

keep telling us they can't help?

CAROL

It lets a crazy man into our

lives.

BEVERLY

Come on. Why fight when we know

how it will come out. This isn't

like stocking or a string of

pearls. You don't send this one

back.

SIMON

Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally,

huh? Why, "finally"? Because I

called you so many times. Maybe

20.

(relief)

Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was

something like that. You didn't

get one of them, huh? 'Cause I

mean it wasn't only your office --

it was your home, hotel and the

cigar club you like in San

Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of

course. I believe you. No, don't

fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm

wrong about the 20 times. Take a

breath...

(more)

So, you miss me a little? Hey,

strike the question -- How's the

case going? Really. Fantastic.

I didn't hear. I haven't been

watching. Great. Just great.

I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me?

Well, I'm mending. No, I look

fine. Well, some of the damage

might still be noticeable if you

look closely...

SIMON

Carl, I need some help and you're

the logical one to turn to.

(aghast)

No! Not 'cause I blame you for

what happened. I hardly get how

you can ever think that. No, I'm

not being sarcastic.

(trying to figure it

out)

I guess because you hired the guy

who did this you think...  No, I am

a sarcastic person. Well, if

you must know, the reason I said

you were the logical person is

because you always told me how you

thought I was this great person

who made you feel good about

humanity and everything. You do

remembering saying that? Well, whew.

Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but

this money thing is ridiculously

serious...

SIMON

"Will you please loan me money? I

will pay you back. I will give

you whatever percentage of my

income I don't absolutely need

until I do. It will take a while.

But I don't know what I'll do if

you say"... that.

(as he listens)

I understand...  yes...  No, I do.

(a bit of boldness)

But you know, you know -- you

didn't even ask how much, Carl?

Well, Frank has no right to

discuss how much I'm in hock...

no, you're right -- not the point.

So...  what have you been up to???

Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...

how was it? Well, I'm not

surprised that there's that much

talent around...  great...  Look --

gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel

that way at all...  take care, you,

too...  you, too...  Good-bye.

(as he hangs up)

Pal o' mine.

MELVIN

Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

SIMON

Thank you for walking him.

SIMON

If you'll excuse me I'm not

feeling so well.

MELVIN

It smells like shit in here?

SIMON

Go away.

MELVIN

That cleaning woman doesn't...

SIMON

Please, just leave.

MELVIN

Where are all your queer party

friends?

SIMON

(his first shout)

Get out.

SIMON

Nothing worse than having to feel

this way in front of you?

MELVIN

Nellie, you're a disgrace to

depression.

SIMON

Rot in hell, Melvin.

MELVIN

No need to stop being a lady...

quit worrying -- you'll be back on

your knees in no time.

SIMON

Is this fun for you? Well, you

lucky devil...  It just gets better

and better. I am losing my

apartment and Frank wants me to

promise to paint hotter subjects

and to beg my parents, who haven't

called, for help... and I won't.

And I don't want to paint anymore.

SIMON

So the life I was trying for is

over. The life I had is gone and

I am feeling so damn sorry for

myself that it is difficult to

breathe. Right times for you --

huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is

terrified...

(a sudden screamed

word surprises them

both)

Terrified...  Lucky you, you're

here for rock bottom...  me

wallowing in self-pity in front of

you, you absolute horror of a

human being...

MELVIN

Well, I'll do one thing for you

that might cheer you up.

SIMON

Get out.

MELVIN

Don't piss on a gift, tough guy.

You want to know why the dog

prefers me...  it's not affection.

It's a trick.

MELVIN

I carry bacon in my pocket.

SIMON

(pleased)

Oh, my gosh.

MELVIN

(hands him bacon)

Now we'll both call him.

SIMON

Come on, sweetheart...

MELVIN

Yo, yo, yo...

SIMON

Would you leave now, please?

MELVIN

Stupid dog.

(to Simon)

I don't get it.

CAROL

Uh, Udall?

MELVIN (O.S.)

Carol the waitress?

CAROL

Yes.

CAROL

The doctors had your billing

address. I'm sorry about the

hour.

MELVIN

I was working...  can't you just

drop me a thank-you note?

CAROL

That's not why I'm here...

(tearing suddenly)

...  though you have no idea what

it's like to have a real

conversation with a doctor about

Spencer...

MELVIN

(very uncomfortable)

Note. Put it in the note.

CAROL

Why did yo do this for me?

MELVIN

To get you back at work so you can

wait on me.

CAROL

But you do have some idea how

strange that sounds??? I'm

worried that you did this

because...

MELVIN

You waiting for me to say

something?

(as she shakes her head)

What sort of thing do you want?

Look, I'll be at the restaurant

tomorrow.

CAROL

I don't think I can wait until

tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

MELVIN

What needs clearing up?

CAROL

(strong and true)

I'm not going to sleep with you.

I will never, ever sleep with you.

Never. Not ever.

MELVIN

I'm sorry. We don't open for the

no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

CAROL

I'm not kidding.

MELVIN

Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

CAROL

Just how grateful I am.

MELVIN

So you'll be at work?

CAROL

Yes.

MELVIN

I took a chance you were up.

MELVIN

I brought you Chinese soup.

SIMON

Thanks.

MELVIN

I have never been so tired in my

life. Okay, if I sit here?

SIMON

Got any easier questions?

MELVIN

I haven't been sleeping. I

haven't been clear or felt like

myself. I'm in trouble. Some son

of a bitch is burning my bridges

behind my back...  But the

tiredness -- boy...  Not just

sleepy.

SIMON

But sick -- nauseous -- where

everything looks distorted and

everything inside just aches --

when you can barely get up the

will to complain.

MELVIN

(brightening)

Yeah...

MELVIN

I'm glad we did this.

MELVIN

Good talking to you.

BEVERLY

You're not still writing that

thank-you note?

CAROL

I'm on the last page. How do you

spell conscience?

BEVERLY

C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean

from the bakery to baby-sit so

let's go out.

CAROL

I still don't feel safe leaving

Spencer with someone. How do you

spell it again?

BEVERLY

Spencer is okay. You'd better

start finding something else to do

with your free time. If you can't

feel good about this break and

step out a little...

(struts and pumps

her arms)

You ought to get Mr. Udall to send

you over a psychiatrist.

CAROL

(more emotionally

than she intended)

I don't need one 'cause I know

what's really going on here. I

have to finish this letter or

I'll go nuts.

(looking at paper;

weepy)

This can't be right -- con-

science.

BEVERLY

Carol. What?

CAROL

I don't know... It's very strange

not feeling that stupid panic

thing inside you all the time.

Without that you just start

thinking about yourself -- and

what does that ever get anybody.

Today, on the bus there was this

adorable couple and I felt myself

giving them a dirty look -- I had

no idea everything was...

BEVERLY

Go ahead.

CAROL

(great, forceful

hand gestures)

... moving in the wrong

direction... Away from when I

even remembered what it was like

to have a man to... anything...

hold fucking -- sorry -- hands

with, for Christ's sake. I was

feeling like really bad that Dr.

Bettes is married.

(this next one's

tough)

Which is probably why I make poor

Spencer hug me more than he wants

to... Like the poor kid doesn't

have enough problems. He has to

make up for his mom not getting

any.

(weeps at her

insight)

Oh, boy. Who needs these

thoughts?

BEVERLY

Spencer's doing fine. So what are

you saying, that you're frustr...

CAROL

Leave me be! Why are you doing

this? Why are you picking at my

sores... What is it that you

want?... You want what? What's

with you? I hope getting me

thinking of everything that's

wrong when all I want is to not

do this has some purpose.

(puffy; red;

furious)

What is it, Mom? No kidding.

CAROL

What is it you want? What?

BEVERLY

I want us to go out.

CAROL

(simply)

Okay.

CAROL

(to Sean)

We're going out.

SEAN

(looking at their

red eyes)

Looks like fun.

CAROL

Okay -- we're out of here. I love

you.

CAROL

Do you love me?

SPENCER

Uh-huh.

BEVERLY

Nice to get out, isn't it?

CAROL

Don't get it wet.

CAROL

So it's okay?

LISA

You almost have me liking him.

You sure come from the heart. I

never knew what you went through

with everything.

CAROL

I wanted him to know how much he'd

done.

(looking over)

Can you believe he's eating with

someone.

MELVIN

It's not my dog and this Simon

seems to have enough on his mind

-- but he did throw up twice and

his spark is off.

FRANK

Sure -- take him to the vet.

MELVIN

I did. And his stomach is out of

whack. So they need him for a

couple of days.

FRANK

Do it.

CAROL

Melvin.

MELVIN

What's this?

CAROL

(sotto)

A thank-you note for what you did

for me.

FRANK

She's nice.

MELVIN

(to Frank)

Really nice. Shouldn't that be a

good thing... telling someone,

'no thanks required.'

FRANK

It looks like it really went over.

You're sure making the rounds.

Simon says you brought him soup

last night. I hope he doesn't

write you a note.

FRANK

What?

MELVIN

"What?" Look at you... You sense

a mark.

FRANK

Hey -- you called me... I...

MELVIN

About a dog.

FRANK

Yeah, but it's all about Simon

now... you helped with the dog...

And now there are other things.

I'm just as concerned as you are

about Simon.

MELVIN

Concerned. I'm just the hall

monitor here.

FRANK

It's not only financial

assistance. What he's got to do

is go to Baltimore tomorrow and

ask his parents for money. It's

not going to happen on the phone.

MELVIN

Yeah. If his parents are alive

they've got to help -- those are

the rules. Good.

FRANK

Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high

maintenance selling painter coming

through... So I'm out. Can you

take him?

MELVIN

Think white and get serious.

FRANK

Take my car -- a convertible. Do

you drive?

MELVIN

(loudly)

Like the wind but I'm not doing

it.

CAROL

Getting loud, getting loud.

MELVIN

He wants me to take his car and

his client to Baltimore.

CAROL

I want your life for a minute

where my big problem is someone

offers me a free convertible so I

can get out of this city.

MELVIN

Okay. I'll take him. Get him

packed -- ready -- tomorrow

morning.

MELVIN

(excited)

Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow.

Let's not drag this out. We don't

enjoy another that much.

FRANK

If there's some mental health

foundation that raises money to

help people like you be sure to

let me know.

MELVIN

Last word freak.

CAROL

So. Anything else?

MELVIN

Yes. I'm going to give my queer

neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

CAROL

Okay.

MELVIN

Hey, what I did for you is working

out?

CAROL

(a breath; then)

What you did changed my life.

MELVIN

No... no thank you notes.

CAROL

Well, part of what I said in this

entire history of my life which

you won't read is that somehow

you've done more for my mother, my

son and me, than anyone else ever

has... And that makes you the most

important, surprising, generous

person I've ever met and that you

be in our daily prayers forever.

MELVIN

Lovely.

CAROL

I also wrote one part... I wrote

I'm sorry... I was talking about I

was sorry when I got mad at you

when you came over and you told my

son that he ought to answer back

so I wrote that.

(reading from the

letter, Melvin

wildly uncomfortable)

I was sorry for busting you on

that... and I'm sorry for busting

in on you that night... when I

said I was never... I was sorry

and I'm sorry every time your food

was cold and that you had to wait

two seconds for a coffee filler...

CAROL

... and I'm sorry for never

spotting, right there at the table

in the restaurant, the human being

that had it in him to do this

thing for us... You know what, I'm

just going to start from the

beginning... I have not been able

to express my gratefulness to

you... even as I look at the word

"grateful" now it doesn't begin to

tell you what I feel for you...

MELVIN

Nice of you... thank you.

CAROL

Thank you.

MELVIN

Now I want you to do something for me.

CAROL

Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say,

"what?" I thought I said,

"what?"... What?

MELVIN

I want you to go on this trip.

CAROL

No, sir...

MELVIN

I can't do this alone. I'm afraid

he'll pull the stiff one eye on

me. I need you to chaperon.

Separate everything but cars. You

said you liked convertibles. Now

I'm on the hook.

CAROL

The stiff one eye?

MELVIN

Two days.

CAROL

I can't. I work.

MELVIN

You take off when you have to.

CAROL

My son.

MELVIN

Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

CAROL

(no other way)

Melvin, I'd rather not.

MELVIN

What's that got to do with it?

CAROL

Funny, I thought it was a strong

point.

MELVIN

Write me a note and ain't she

sweet. I need a hand and where'd

she go.

CAROL

Are you saying accepting your help

obligates me!?

MELVIN

Is there another way to see it?

CAROL

No.

CAROL

Well, here's a little suitcase

shocked that it's been used.

CAROL

(furiously exasperated)

There's not way to pack for this

trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm

not packing the camera.

MELVIN

Woo-woo.

CAROL

Hello?

MELVIN

Are you still coming?

CAROL

Yes.

CAROL

Melvin... I'd like to know exactly

where we are going.

MELVIN

Just south to Baltimore, Maryland.

So I know what you're going to ask

next.

(correcting himself)

That you might ask -- I'm not

certain.

CAROL

There's... there's no need to

bring anything dressy... or... I

mean -- I didn't know if we'd be

eating at any restaurant that

have dress codes.

MELVIN

Oh.

(a beat)

We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

CAROL

Okay, gotcha. What did you think

I was going to ask?

MELVIN

Whether crabs are in season there

now...

CAROL

Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good

night.

BEVERLY

How was it talking to him?

CAROL

Stop treating this like I'm going

away with a man. He's just going

to say those crappy, sick,

complaining, angry things to me.

I hate this, Mom -- I hate this.

He's a freak show -- the worst

person I ever met.

BEVERLY

Well, maybe he has nice friends.

CAROL

(to Spencer)

You stand there and I'll wave to

you from the back window.

BEVERLY

Call me as soon as you're settled.

CAROL

(to Spencer)

I love you.

CAROL

(to bus driver)

Sensitive, huh?!

VETERINARIAN

Anything unusual in the dog's

diet?

MELVIN

No. Everybody gets their own

cage?

VETERINARIAN

Certainly.

MELVIN

(pointing to

Chihuahua)

Put him in with that one, not that

one...

(pointing to large

dog)

... Builds his confidence.

FRANK

I'm sorry that I'm not taking

you.

SIMON

(upset)

So am I, Frank.

MELVIN

Soak it up -- it's your last

chance at a hug for a few days.

CAROL

Hi.

MELVIN

Thanks for being on time... Carol,

the waitress, this is Simon, the

fag.

CAROL

Hello... Oh, my God, who did that

to you?

SIMON

I, uh... I was... attacked.

Walked in on people robbing me. I

was hospitalized. I almost died.

MELVIN

Let's do the small talk in the

car. Load up.

MELVIN

I was going to do that for you.

CAROL

(taken aback)

It's okay. No problem. Where

should we sit?

MELVIN

(totally non-plussed)

I -- uh, I... Well, there is no

place cards or anything.

CAROL

(to Simon)

Let me go in back. You look like

you need all the room you can

manage.

SIMON

That's very thoughtful.

MELVIN

Never a break. Never.

MELVIN

You're really jammed back there.

CAROL

Thanks, Melvin.

MELVIN

Welcome.

MELVIN

I got the whole ride programmed.

MELVIN

Just wanted to see what you'd do.

No, we have greatness here.

CAROL (O.S.)

Hey, I like this music.

CAROL

I don't know the last time I've

been out of the city... Hey, my

arms are tanning. I used to tan

great. We gotta stop soon so'se

I can check on Spencer.

SIMON

(during the above)

I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I

can't turn my head all the way

yet... tell her we can't hear her.

MELVIN

Doesn't matter. She's enjoying

herself. Consider it part of the

music.

CAROL

I'm sure, Simon, they did

something real off for you to feel

this way... But when it comes to

your partners -- or your kid --

things will always be off for you

unless you set it straight. Maybe

this thing happened to you just to

give you that chance.

MELVIN

Nonsense!

CAROL

Anybody here who's interested in

what Melvin has to say raise their

hands.

SIMON

Do you want to know what happened

with my parents?

CAROL

Yes. I really would.

SIMON

Well...

CAROL

No, let me pull over so I can pay

full attention.

CAROL

Now go ahead.

SIMON

Well, I always painted. Always.

And my mother always encouraged

it. She was sort of fabulous

about it actually... and she used

to... I was too young to think

there was anything at all wrong

with it... and she was very

natural. She used to pose nude

for me... and I thought or assumed

my father was aware of it.

MELVIN

This stuff is pointless.

CAROL

Hey -- you let him...

MELVIN

You like sad stories -- you want

mine.

CARL

. Go ahead, Simon. Really.

Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

SIMON

Okay. Well, one day my father

came in on one of those painting

sessions when I was nine -- and he

just started screaming at her --

at us -- at evil. And...

MELVIN

(very quickly)

... my father didn't leave his

room for 11 years -- he hit my

hand with a yardstick if I made a

mistake on the piano.

CAROL

Go ahead, Simon. Your father

walked in on you and was yelling

and... really, come on.

SIMON

I was trying to defend my mother

and make peace, in the lamest way.

I said, "she's not naked -- it's

art." And then he started hitting

me. And he beat me unconscious.

After that he talked to me less

and less -- he knew before I left

for college, my dad came into my

room. He held out his hand. It

was filled with money. A big wad

of sweaty money.

(gathers himself)

And he said to me, "I don't want

you to ever come back." I grabbed

him and I hugged him... He turns

and walked out.

CAROL

Well, you know -- I still stay

what I said. You've got to get

past it all when it comes to your

parents. We all have these horror

stories to get over.

MELVIN

That's not true. Some of us have

great stories... pretty stories

that take place at lakes with

boats and friends and noodle

salad. Just not anybody in this

car. But lots of people -- that's

their story -- good times and

noodle salad... and that's what

makes it hard. Not that you had

it bad but being that pissed that

so many had it good.

CAROL

No.

SIMON

Not it at all, really.

MELVIN

(a veteran's irony)

Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to

the hotel. And if you're lucky

tomorrow Dad will give you another

wad of sweaty money.

MELVIN

Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...

CAROL

(to Simon)

No answer... Maybe we should just

drive there tomorrow. Can I have

that one?

MELVIN

Yes... sure.

(to Simon)

I'll take the sofa.

CAROL

(into phone)

Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are

you out of breath? You did?!?

That is great... So great... So --

no, wait a second, Spence...

MELVIN

Can I ask you a personal question?

MELVIN

Do you ever get an erection for a

woman?

SIMON

Melvin...

MELVIN

Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier

if you were not...

SIMON

You consider your life easy.

MELVIN

I give you that one...

(eyes suitcase)

Nice packing.

CAROL

My son was outside playing soccer.

I never saw him playing ball. Come

on, you guys -- take me out for a

good time... Take me out dancing.

MELVIN

Dancing?

SIMON

I can't, I'm exhausted.

CAROL

(to Simon)

I don't blame you... This is a

monumental first day out... You

sad or anything?

SIMON

No... Nervous. It would be very

rough, Carol, if you weren't

along.

CAROL

What a nice compliment.

CAROL

I'm happy. And you're my date.

Let's get dressed.

MELVIN

I'm going to jump in the shower.

I'll be right with you.

VALET

Good evening, sir.

MELVIN

They sell hard shell crabs here?

VALET

Yes.

HEAD WAITER

Good evening.

MELVIN

Hi. You have hard shells, right?

CAROL

Stop asking everyone.

MELVIN

Just him and that's it. Okay, you

can answer -- we've worked it out.

HEAD WAITER

Yes, we do... And I can give you a

tie and jacket.

MELVIN

What?

HEAD WAITER

They require a tie and jacket but

we have some available.

MELVIN

No... I'm not wearing that -- and

just in case you were going to ask

I'm not going to let you inject me

with plaque either.

CAROL

You promised a nice place -- can't

you just...

(to Head Waiter)

You have these dry cleaned all the

time, don't you?

HEAD WAITER

Actually, I don't think so.

MELVIN

(to Carol)

Wait here.

SALESMAN

Good evening.

MELVIN

I need a coat and tie.

SALESMAN

Come on in.

MELVIN

No.

SALESMAN

No?

MELVIN

(pointing)

That jacket and give me a tie.

VALET #2

Good evening.

MELVIN

You have hard shells?

VALET #2

I'm not sure.

MELVIN

Everyone else says you do.

VALET #2

Then I guess we do.

HEAD WAITER

Shall I get her for you?

MELVIN

No, it's all right. I'll just

watch.

CAROL

(mouthing the words

to Melvin)

My drink is following me.

CAROL

You look s...

CAROL

You look great.

CAROL

You wanna dance?

MELVIN

I've been thinking about that

since you brought it up before.

CAROL

(rising)

And?

MELVIN

No...

(and before she can

digest that)

... I don't get this place. They

make me buy an outfit but they let

you wear a house dress. I don't

get it.

MELVIN

No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't

mean it. You gotta sit down. You

can still give me the dirty

look... just sit down and give it

to me.

CAROL

Melvin, pay me a compliment... I

need one and quick... You have no

idea how much what you said just

hurt my feelings.

MELVIN

(really pissed,

mutters)

That monominute somebody gets that

you need them they threaten to go

away. Never fails.

CAROL

That's not compliment, Melvin...

That's just trying to sound smart

so I feel stupid... A compliment

is something nice about somebody

else... Now or never.

MELVIN

Okay.

CAROL

(sitting)

And mean it...

MELVIN

Can we order first?

MELVIN

(calling)

Two crab dinners and pitcher of

cold beer.

(to Carol)

Baked or fries?

CAROL

Fries.

MELVIN

(calling)

One baked -- one fries.

STARTLED WAITER

(shouting back)

I'll tell your waiter.

MELVIN

(to Carol)

Okay, I got a real great

compliment for you and it's true.

CAROL

I am so afraid you're about to say

something awful...

MELVIN

Don't be pessimistic. It's not

your style. Okay... Here I

goes... Clearly a mistake.

(this is hell

for him)

I have this -- what? Ailment...

And my doctor -- a shrink... who

I used to see all the time... he

says 50 or 60 percent of the time

a pill can really help. I hate

pills. Very dangerous things,

pills. "Hate," I am using the

word "hate" about pills. My

compliment is that when you came

to my house that time and told me

how you'd never -- well, you were

there, you know... The next

morning I started taking these

pills.

CAROL

(a little confused)

I don't quite get how that's a

compliment for me.

MELVIN

You make me want to be a better

man.

CAROL

That's maybe the best compliment

of my life.

MELVIN

Then I've really overshot here

'cause I was aiming at just enough

to keep you from walking out.

CAROL

So how are you doing with those

pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

MELVIN

Takes months to know... They work

little by little.

(holds his head;

then)

Talking like this is exhausting.

CAROL

Have you ever let a romantic

moment make you do something you

know is stupid?

MELVIN

Never.

CAROL

Here's the trouble with never.

MELVIN

You don't owe me that.

CAROL

That wasn't payment. When you

first came into breakfast, when I

saw you -- I thought you were

handsome... Then, of course, you

spoke... So now that your soft

li'l underbelly is all exposed.

Tell me, why did you bring me?

MELVIN

Well, ah... that's a personal

question.

CAROL

Tell me even if you're scared.

Tell me why you wanted me here.

It's okay.

CAROL

If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

MELVIN

(dissembling)

There are lots of reason... I had

a thought that if you had sex with

Simon it might...

CAROL

(humiliated)

Sex with Simon?

MELVIN

It's one idea...

CAROL

That's why you brought me? Look

at me! Is that really why you

brought me... Like I'm a what and

I owe you what?!

MELVIN

I don't know why I brought you --

that idea occurred to me is all...

It came out first... Hey, you kiss

him -- me... He says he loves

you. You two hit it off. But you

don't want to... fine... Forget

what I said about sex with Simon.

It was a mistake.

CAROL

(wiping away tears)

I'll never forget you said it.

MELVIN

It was a mistake.

PARENTS' VOICE

(humorless male

voice)

Hi. This is Fred Bishop...

(perky woman's

voice)

... and Betty.

(Fred again)

We are sorry to be unable to take

your call right now. Please leave

a message and we'd appreciate your

including the time/date and

purpose of your call.

(Simon mouths the

word "date," then

Betty speaks before

the beep Bye-bye.

SIMON

Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in

town...

(he waits)

... and, folks, you haven't come

home later than 10 in your lives.

Please pick up -- really...

Okay... I'm going to call again in

the morning. I need to see you.

Or, at least get you to answer the

phone.

SIMON

Hello... Hello???

SIMON

Was this supposed to be your room?

CAROL

Our room. I don't want to see him

and he's not going to come

knocking on your door.

SIMON

Can you not be violent?

CAROL

I don't think so. You need help

with the pants?

SIMON

(emphatically)

No!!!

CAROL

I'm going to take a big bath and

order a big meal.

SIMON

Uh-huh...

CAROL

I'm sorry... are you okay?

SIMON

Well, considering everything's

horrible and tomorrow I have to

face my parents... Don't ask me

... I'm sick of my own complaints

... got to get me a new set of

thoughts.

CAROL

Why? What have you been thinking

about?

SIMON

How to die, mostly.

CAROL

Can you believe in our little mix

you're the good roommate.

SIMON

(turning off the light)

Good night.

CAROL

Good night.

SIMON

(a whisper)

Hold it.

SIMON

I've got to sketch you.

CAROL

No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer

than you think. I give the wrong

impression sometimes and...

SIMON

I haven't even been thinking about

sketching for weeks.

CAROL

Stop staring. Do a vase.

SIMON

But you're beautiful... your skin

glows.

CAROL

Thanks. But I just want to take a

bath and...

SIMON

That long neck -- the line of

you... you're porcelain... your

back goes on forever. You're

classic... you're why cavemen

chiseled on walls...

CAROL

All right, cut me a break.

MELVIN

So then, the next thing I know,

she's sitting right next to me,

and then, well, it's not right to

go into the details, but I screwed

up. I got nervous. I said the

wrong thing and if I hadn't, I

could be in bed now with a woman

who if you could make her smile

you got a life. Instead, I'm here

with you, no offense, a moron

pushing the last legal drug.

CAROL (O.S.)

I don't care how you put it --

We're being naughty here, pal.

SIMON

No. No. This is great, this is

so great. I can't get the angle

with this cast.

MELVIN

Did you have sex with her?

MELVIN

Sorry, didn't realize she was

right there.

(a beat)

Did you have sex with her?

CAROL

To hell with sex.

CAROL

We held each other. It was better

than sex. What I need he gave me

great.

SIMON

I just love her.

(beat)

How're you doing?

SIMON

Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely

hear you. Do you have to whisper?

No -- don't apologize -- it was

the luckiest thing for all of us

that you didn't answer last

night... I can't hear you... okay,

dear, just listen to me then.

MELVIN

I get why you're angry. It's no

snap to explain why I was like

that, but let's not try to do it

on the run...

SIMON

... so Mom. Truly no grudges --

truly. A little odd that you

didn't come to see me when you

heard I was hurt, but the

important thing I want you to know

is your son is happy. I'm working

again. I'll make do -- I don't

want a thing. Wouldn't take it if

it was offered. I'll drop you a

note from wherever I land and then

it's up to you. I hope we patch

things up but know that if we

don't, I wish you both the very

best... I can't hear you. You

heard me, though, right? Good --

take good care. 'Bye.

MELVIN

... Now he's going to want to

stay. And they'll want to take a

ride to the lake or whatever. So

it's a good five hours back. It

gives us a chance to take it easy

and...

SIMON

I'm going back with you.

CAROL

But what about...

SIMON

I'll take care of myself --

MELVIN

What are you talking about? You

got real problems.

SIMON

I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

Suddenly everything seems so easy.

Carol, a load has been lifted.

CAROL

One night with me!

SIMON

You think you're kidding.

MELVIN

(to Frank over

the phone)

Aww Jesus! No choice.

CAROL

I got a gift for you.

MELVIN

(on phone)

Nothing like no choice to make you

feel at home.

CAROL

(to Simon)

Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

MELVIN

Do it then. Get the dog picked

up. I can't believe you let it

stay there.

MELVIN

Good-bye.

(to Simon)

Well, your luck is holding. They

sublet your place. You're

homeless. Frank's got a line on

another place you can use for now.

SIMON

Another place where?

MELVIN

Does it matter?

CAROL

I don't want to hear that music

right now.

MELVIN

What do you mean? You said you

liked it.

CAROL

I don't.

MELVIN

This one has a special meaning.

CAROL

It's your car but I don't want to

hear it. If that means anything.

MELVIN

Here are the keys to my apartment.

I'm going to park you in my place

while I take Carol home.

CAROL

(hefting bag)

I'll take a bus.

MELVIN

I'll take you... why not?

CAROL

I don't care what you did for me.

I don't think I want to know you

anymore -- all you do is make me

feel badly about myself.

(turning to Simon)

You have my number.

SIMON

(hugging her)

I love you...

(sotto)

Let him take you home.

CAROL

Don't want to. I love you.

MELVIN

Don't say anything.

MELVIN (O.S.)

I told you to go on in.

SIMON (O.S.)

Look, I've got to get a hold of

Frank and see where I'm hanging my

hat 'cause...

MELVIN

I think you gotta camp it here...

SIMON

What are you talking about?

SIMON

(to Verdell)

I know the feeling -- you feel

like your ol' self again, huh? --

Mommy and Daddy are home.

SIMON

Sorry... You're fun to mess with.

MELVIN

They took your place furnished.

Jackie said she grabbed your

personal stuff -- they were

supposed to set you up here.

(leading the way)

There's this extra room -- I

never use. It gets good light.

No other answer really.

SIMON

Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm

me.

MELVIN

They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

SIMON

I love you.

MELVIN

I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the

luckiest guy alive if that did it

for me.

SIMON (O.S.)

Where is my big hairy boy?

SIMON (O.S.)

Verdell, sweeties?

SIMON

Sorry, didn't know you were awake.

I just thought Verdell shouldn't

get too used to sleeping in here

'cause then...

MELVIN

Look, we both want the dog --

and...

SIMON

Should I get it?

SIMON (O.S.)

Hello.

SIMON

(into phone)

Hello. It's me. He took me in.

Did you know? Hold on, I'll get

him for you.

SIMON

It's Carol.

MELVIN

Here. Take the dog.

SIMON

Good luck.

MELVIN

Hello.

CAROL

Yeah... Well...

MELVIN

(very concerned)

How you doing?

CAROL

I can trust my brain.

MELVIN

That seems like a good choice.

CAROL

I don't know whether I'm being

sensible or hard on you.

MELVIN

The two might go together.

CAROL

See. There's an example. I don't

know whether you're being cute or

crazy now.

MELVIN

(what the hell)

Cute.

CAROL

You don't have to answer

everything I say. Just listen to

me. Okay?

CAROL

It's really something that you're

looking after Simon. And what I

said on the street. That was a

bad thing to say. And it made me

sick to my stomach. It was a bad

thing to say. And I'd be lying if

I didn't say that I enjoyed your

company... but the truth is you do

bother me enormously and I know --

think -- that it's best for me to

not have contact with you because

you're just not ready and you're a

pretty old guy to not be ready...

and I'm too old to ignore that.

But there were extraordinary

kindnesses that did take place.

So thanks for the trips...

MELVIN

Okay to say something now?

CAROL

Go ahead.

MELVIN

I should've danced with you.

CAROL

Okay. Good-bye.

MELVIN

So long.

MELVIN

You going to come talk to me or

not?

SIMON

I'm coming.

SIMON

What did she say?

MELVIN

I'm a great guy --

"extraordinary"...

(before Simon can

celebrate)

... and she doesn't want contact

with me.

(a beat)

I'm dying here.

SIMON

Because...

(gently)

... you love her?

MELVIN

(sharply)

No... and you're supposed to be

sensitive and sharp.

SIMON

Okay... you tell me why --

(mimics him)

"You're dying here."

MELVIN

I don't know... Let me sleep on it

and figure it out.

(then)

Because I'm stuck! Can't go back

to what I had... She's evicted me

from my life.

SIMON

Did you like it that much?

MELVIN

(furiously)

It was better than this... Look,

you, I'm very intelligent. If

you're going to give me advice or

conversation or consolation or

hope, you got to be better than

you're doing. If you can't be at

least momentarily interesting than

shut the hell up. I'm drowning

and you're describing water.

SIMON

(getting pissed)

Picking on me won't help.

MELVIN

Well, if that's true then I'm

really in trouble.

SIMON

But you know where you're lucky?

MELVIN

Absolutely not.

SIMON

You know who you want. I'll take

your seat any day. So do

something... don't sleep on it...

go over there. I don't think

anybody should ever sleep on

anything -- it's not always good

to let things calm down.

MELVIN

Hey... I'm charged here. But she

might kill me for showing up this

late.

SIMON

Then get in your jammies and I'll

read you a story... I think you've

got a chance. The only real enemy

you have is her ability to think

logically -- the best thing you

have going for you is your

willingness to humiliate yourself

if it gives you one chance in

whatever -- so go catch her off-

guard.

MELVIN

Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

SIMON

What's wrong?

MELVIN

I forgot to lock the door.

CAROL

What do you want, Melvin?

MELVIN

Were you asleep?

CAROL

What do you want?

MELVIN

'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm

sorry. And you could be grouchy.

CAROL

Grouchy?

MELVIN

... 'Cause of being woken up, and

it would make my job impossible.

So then I wouldn't even try.

CAROL

What job?

MELVIN

Were you asleep?

CAROL

What are you doing here?

MELVIN

I'm sorry I woke you -- some other

time.

CAROL

I wasn't asleep!!

MELVIN

What a break...

CAROL

(losing it a bit)

Is it a secret what you're doing

here?

MELVIN

I had to see you...

CAROL

Because...

MELVIN

It relaxes me... I'd feel better

just sitting on the curb in front

of your house than anyplace else

I can think of or imagine.

MELVIN

(serious)

Wait a minute, I'm overstating

here, maybe the inside stairs. I

don't want to sit with my feet in

the gutter. What does that serve?

It only...

CAROL

Stop it!! Why can't I have a

normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out

of here. Just a regular boyfriend

who doesn't go nuts on me...

BEVERLY

(butting in)

Everybody wants that, dear -- it

doesn't exit...

(as Carol turns

to her)

Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

MELVIN

(hopefully)

Boyfriend?

CAROL

Oh, come on in and try not to ruin

everything by being you.

MELVIN

Maybe we could live without the

wise cracks.

CAROL

Maybe we could...

MELVIN

It feels a little confined here.

Let's take a walk.

CAROL

See. It's four in the morning. A

walk sounds a little screwy to me,

if you don't mind.

MELVIN

If you need an excuse, there's a

bakery on the corner. There's a

shot it'll open soon -- that way

we're not screwy -- we're just

two people who like warm rolls.

CAROL

Okay.

CAROL

(gently; almost

lovingly)

I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever

this is -- is not going to work.

MELVIN

I'm feeling... I've been feeling

better.

CAROL

Melvin, even though it may seem

that way now -- you don't know me

all that well...

(as he scoffs)

I'm not the answer for you.

MELVIN

Hey, I've got a great compliment

for you.

CAROL

You know what? I...

MELVIN

Just let me talk.

(gathers himself

with uncertainty,

then:)

I'm the only one on the face of

the earth who realizes that you're

the greatest woman on earth. I'm

the only one who appreciates how

amazing you are in every single

thing you do -- in every single

thought you have... in how you

are with Spencer -- Spence...

(he has reached

her)

... in how you say what you mean

and how you almost always mean

something that's all about being

straight and good...

MELVIN

I think most people miss that

about you and I watch wondering

how they can watch you bring them

food and clear their dishes and

never get that they have just met

the greatest woman alive... And

the fact that I get it makes me

feel great... about me!

(a real question

filled with

concern for her)

You got a real good reason to walk

out on that?

CAROL

No! It's certainly not. No -- I

don't think so. No.

MELVIN

(tentatively)

I'm gonna grab you.

(with conviction)

I didn't mean it to be a question.

I'm gonna grab you.

MELVIN

I know I can do better.

CAROL

Warm rolls...

FADE OUT
