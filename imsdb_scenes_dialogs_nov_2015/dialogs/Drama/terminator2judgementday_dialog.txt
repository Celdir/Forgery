3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.

The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war

Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new

nightmare, the war against the Machines...

5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.

5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a

5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator

5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator

5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg),

5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)

Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,

sent two terminators back through time.  Their

mission: to destroy the leader of the human

Resistance... John Connor.  My son.

The first terminator was programmed to strike at

me, in the year 1984... before John was born.

It failed.

The second was set to strike at John himself,

when he was still a child.  As before, the

Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A

protector for John.  It was just a question of

which one of them would reach him first...

Gimme that Phillips right there.

I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid.

He won't even answer me.

The next patient is a 29-year old female

diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.

The usual indicators... depression, anxiety,

violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.

SILBERMAN

'Morning, Sarah.

SARAH

Good morning, Dr. Silberman.  How's the knee?

22      INT. CORRIDOR

SILBERMAN

Fine, Sarah.

(he switches off, speaks to

the interns)

She, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a

screwdriver a few weeks ago.

SILBERMAN

The delusional architecture is interesting.

She believes a machine called a "terminator",

which looks human of course, was sent back

though time to kill her.  And also that the

father of her child was a soldier, sent to

protect her... he was from the future too...

(he smiles)

The year 2029, if I remember correctly.

(the interns chuckle)

Let's move on, shall we?

SILBERMAN

Douglas, I don't like seeing the patients

disturbing their rooms like this.  See that she

takes her thorazine, would you?

23      INT. CELL

DOUGLAS

Time to take you meds, Connor.

SARAH

You take it.

DOUGLAS

Now you know you got to be good 'cause you up

for review this afternoon...

I'm not taking it.  Now I don't want any

trouble...

Ain't no trouble at all --

Let's go!

TIM

That her?

TIM

So she's pretty cool, huh?

JOHN

Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's

why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up

a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

TIM

No shit?

JOHN

Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check

out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?

That's right, officer.  What's he done now?

OFFICER X

Could I speak with him, please?

TODD

Well, you could if he was here.  Be he took off

on his bike this morning.  Could be anywhere.

You gonna tell me what his is about?

OFFICER X

I just need to ask him a few questions.

JANELLE

There was a guy here this morning asking about

him, too.

TODD

Yeah, big guy.  On a bike.  Has that got

something to do with it?

OFFICER X

I wouldn't worry.  Do you have a photograph

of John?

TODD

Get the album, Janelle.

Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...

SARAH

Hold me.

REESE

I love you.  I always will.

SARAH

Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

REESE (O.S.)

Where's John, Sarah?

SARAH

They took him from me.

REESE

It's John who's the target now.  You have to

protect him.  He's wide open.

SARAH

I know!

REESE

Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.

SARAH

(struggling not to cry)

I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed

to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the

mission.

REESE

Remember the message... the future is not set.

There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

SARAH

Kyle, don't go!

REESE

(turning back to her)

There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

The children look like burnt paper... black,

not moving.  Then the blast wave hits them and

they fly apart like leaves..."

VIDEO SILBERMAN

Dreams about cataclysm, or the end of the world,

are very common, Sarah...

VIDEO SARAH

It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron!

I know the date is happens!!

VIDEO SILBERMAN

I'm sure it feels very real to you --

VIDEO SARAH

On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty

fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing

number two million sunblock in gonna have a

real bad day, get it?

VIDEO SILBERMAN

Relax now, Sarah --

VIDEO SARAH

You think you're alive and safe, but you're

already dead.  Everybody, you, him...

(she gestures are the

attendant)

everybody... you're all fucking dead!

VIDEO SARAH

You're the one living in a dream, Silberman,

not me!  Because I know it happens.  It

happens!

31C     Silberman pauses the tape... freezing Sarah's contorted face.

SARAH

I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much

better, now.  Clearer.

SILBERMAN

Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive

lately.

SARAH

It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something

to look forward to.

SILBERMAN

And what it that?

SARAH

You said I could be transferred to the minimum

security wing and have visitors if I showed

improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six

months, and I was looking forward to seeing my

son.

SILBERMAN

I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying

about these terminator machines.  Now you think

they don't exist?

SARAH

They don't exist.  I see that now.

SILBERMAN

But you've told me on many occasions about how

you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

SARAH

If I had, there would have been some evidence.

They would have found something at the factory.

SILBERMAN

I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the

company covered it up?

You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know

how smart you are, and I think you're just

telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think

you really believe who you've been telling me

today.

SARAH

You have to let me see my son.  Please.  It's

very important.  He's in danger.  At least let

me call him --

SILBERMAN

I'm afraid not.  Not for a while.  I don't see

any choice but to recommend to the review board

that you stay here another six months.

YOU SON OF A BITCH!!

JOHN

Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are

a terminator, right?

TERMINATOR

Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

JOHN

No way!

JOHN

Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean...

whoah!

(stepping back)

You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right...

but sort of alive outside?

TERMINATOR

I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over

a metal endoskeleton.

JOHN

This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh...

you're not here to kill me... I figured that part

out for myself.  So what's the deal?

TERMINATOR

My mission is to protect you.

JOHN

Yeah?  Who sent you?

TERMINATOR

You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed

me to be your protector here, in this time.

JOHN

This is deep.

50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JOHN

So this other guy?  He's a terminator too,

right, like you?

TERMINATOR

Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype.

A mimetic polyalloy.

JOHN

What does that mean?

TERMINATOR

Liquid metal.

JOHN

Radical.

TERMINATOR

You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000

will not stop until it complete its mission.

Ever.

JOHN

Where we going?

TERMINATOR

We have to leave the city, immediately.  And

avoid the authorities.

JOHN

Can I stop by my house?

TERMINATOR

Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to

reacquire you there.

JOHN

You sure?

TERMINATOR

I would.

should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole.

JOHN

Something's wrong.  She's never this nice.

TODD

What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at?

SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!

JOHN

The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already

there.  What should I do?

JANELLE

John?  John, are you okay?

TERMINATOR

(in John's voice)

I'm right here.  I'm fine.

(to John, a whisper)

What's the dog's name?

JOHN

Max.

TERMINATOR

Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can

hear him barking.  Is he okay?

JANELLE

(filtered)

Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you?

Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go.

I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me

it can imitate anything it touches?

TERMINATOR

Anything it samples by physical contact.

JOHN

Like it could disguise itself as anything...

a pack of cigarettes?

TERMINATOR

No.  Only an object of equal size.

JOHN

Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to

get me?

TERMINATOR

It can't form complex machines.  Guns and

explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It

doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid

metal shapes.

56A     In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the

57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

JOHN

We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places

like that.  For a while she was with this crazy

ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there

were some other guys.  She'd shack up with

anybody she could learn from.  So then she

could teach me how to be this great military

leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like...

sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you

know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought

up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?

I hated her for that.

(he looks up)

But everything she said was true.

(he stands)

We gotta get her out of there.

TERMINATOR

Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for

success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and

wait for you to make contact with her.

JOHN

Oh, great.  And what happens to her?

TERMINATOR

Typically, the subject being copied is

terminated.

JOHN

TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me?

We gotta right now!

TERMINATOR

Negative.  She is not a mission priority.

JOHN

Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

JOHN

Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem?

JOHN

Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this

psycho off of me!

JOHN

Let go of me!!

JOHN

Oww!  Why'd you do that?

TERMINATOR

You told me to.

JOHN

You have to do what I say?!

TERMINATOR

That is one of my mission parameters.

JOHN

Prove it... stand on one foot.

JOHN

Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!

FIRST JOCK

Hey, kid.  You okay?

JOHN

Take a hike, bozo.

FIRST JOCK

Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit.

JOHN

Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?!

(to Terminator)

Grab this guy.

JOHN

Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?

JOHN

Put the gun down!  NOW!!

JOHN

Walk away.

JOHN

Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!

TERMINATOR

Of course.  I'm a terminator.

JOHN

Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not

a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that?

You can't just go around killing people!

TERMINATOR

Why?

JOHN

Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!

TERMINATOR

Why?

JOHN

You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

JOHN

Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come

along, that's fine with me.

Mom, are you okay?

Come with me if you want to live.

It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help.

Go!  Run!

73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,

Everything.

JOHN

Cool.

SARAH

You okay?

JOHN

I said I was okay.

SARAH

It was stupid of you to go there.

SARAH

Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than

that.  You're too important!  You can't risk

yourself, not even for me, do you understand?

I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine.

Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed.

JOHN

I... had to get you out of the place... I'm

sorry, I...

Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John.

That's good.  Because if you can't pass for

human, you won't be much good to us.

JOHN

How long do you live?  I mean, last?

TERMINATOR

A hundred and twenty years on my existing

power cell.

JOHN

Can you learn?  So you can be... you know.

More human.  Not such a dork all the time.

TERMINATOR

My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning

computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to

"read-only" when we are sent out alone.

Alright, it!  We need it!

We're better off by ourselves.

But it's the only proof we have to the future...

about the war and all that.

I don't trust it!  These things are hard to

kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never

have this opportunity again.

Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great

No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people

talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or

some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

JOHN

It someone comes off to you with an attitude,

you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on,

it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

"Hasta la vista, baby"?

Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets

upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you

Hi.  Nice place you got here.  How's business?

FIRST KID

Are so!

JOHN

We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I

mean.

TERMINATOR

It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.

JOHN

Yeah.  Drag, huh?

SARAH

I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's

responsible?

TERMINATOR

The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet

Dyson, Director of Special Projects at

Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

SARAH

Why him?

TERMINATOR

In a few months he creates a revolutionary

type of mircoprocessor.

SARAH

Then what?

98B     Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks.

TERMINATOR

In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest

supplier of military computer systems.  All

stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne

computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward,

the fly with a perfect operational record.

SARAH

(getting behind John)

Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in

Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer

run the whole show, right?

TERMINATOR

Basically.

(starting the engine, backing

out)

The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system

goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions

are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet

begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes

self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29.

In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

SARAH

And Skynet fights back.

TERMINATOR

Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their

targets in Russia.

SARAH

Why attack Russia?

TERMINATOR

Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike

will remove its enemies here.

SARAH

Jesus.

(beat, then)

How much do you know about Dyson?

TERMINATOR

I have detailed files.

SARAH

I want to know everything.  What he looks like.

Where he lives.  Everything.

Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the

kids to Raging Waters today.

DYSON

Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.

DYSON

Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away.

It's a neural-net process --

TARISSA

I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net

processor.  It thinks and learns like we do.

It's superconducting at room temperature.

Other computer are pocket calculators by

comparison.

(she pulls away from him)

But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?

I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm

going crazy here, sometimes.

DYSON

I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis

close.

DYSON

Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes

a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to

work with a hangover.

Meet the pilot.

TARISSA

Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have

these two children?  You don't need us.  Your

heart and your mind are in here.

Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like,

1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born

yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's

that other bolt?

Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one

night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see

her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally,

of course.  Like she says she got something in

her eye.

Why do you cry?

You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry.

You know.  When it hurts.

Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly

so clear.  The Terminator would never stop, it

would never leave him... it would always be

there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout

at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it

couldn't spend time with him because it was too

busy.  And it would die to protect him.  Of all

the would-be fathers who came and went over the

years, this thing, this machine, was the only

one who measured up.  In an insane world, it was

the sanest choice.

It's gotta be from the other one like you.

TERMINATOR

(to Sarah)

The CPU from the first terminator.

SARAH

Son of a bitch, I knew it!

DYSON

They told us not to ask where they got it.  I

thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I

didn't want to know.

SARAH

Those lying motherfuckers!

DYSON

I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was

shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas,

It took us in new directions... things we would

never have thought of.  All this work is based

on it.

TERMINATOR

I must be destroyed.

SARAH

(to Dyson)

Can you get us in there, past security?

DYSON

I think so, yeah.  When?

DYSON

Now?

(he takes a breath)

Yeah, right.

TARISSA

Miles, I'm scared.  Okay.  But the only thing

that scares me more than you going... is you

not going.

SARAH

(to Terminator)

Is it safe for them here?

TERMINATOR

(to Tarissa)

Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now.

Don't pack.

Let's go.

July 11, 2029

SARAH (V.O.)

August 29th 1997 came and went.  Nothing much

happened.  Michael Jackson turned forty.  There

was no Judgment Day.  People went to work as

they always do, laughed, complained, watched

TV, made love.

SARAH (V.O.)

I wanted to run down the street yelling... to

grab them all and say "Every day form this day

is a gift.  Use it well!"  Instead I got drunk.

SARAH (V.O.)

That was thirty years ago.  But the dark future

which never came still exists for me, and it

always will, like the traces of a dream lingering

in the morning light.  And the war against the

machines goes on.  Or, to be more precise, the

war against those who build the wrong machines.

SARAH (V.O.)

John fights the war differently than it was

foretold.  Here, on the battlefield of the

Senate, the weapons are common sense... and

hope.

GIRL

Tie me, grandma.

SARAH (V.O.)

The luxury of hope was given to me by the

Terminator.  Because if a machine can learn

the value of human life... maybe we can too.
