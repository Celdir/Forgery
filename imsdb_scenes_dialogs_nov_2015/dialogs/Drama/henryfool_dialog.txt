SHOOTING DRAFT

WARREN

(to Amy)

You want some?

FAY

(to Simon)

Where the hell have you been?

(to Mary)

Mom, come on and eat.

MARY

I'm not hungry.

FAY

(pissed)

Then why'd I cook!

MARY

I don't know why you cooked! I don't

know why you bother!

FAY

Sit down and eat, Simon.

FAY

God, I wanna get fucked.

FAY

You OK?

FAY

See ya later.

HENRY

Get up off your knees.

HENRY

Where you gotta go to get a six-pack

of beer around here?

AMY

Say something.

WARREN

(calling)

She's mute.

AMY

What?

WARREN

She don't -- you know -- talk.

AMY

Kiss my ass.

WARREN

(scared)

Oh, shit!

MR DENG

(in Vietnamese)

Stay the hell out of my store, you

good-for-nothing punks!

MR DENG

Look at this! What's going on here?

Simon, get up off the floor! Is this

beer paid for?

HENRY

(off-screen)

Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the

end.

SIMON

Where do you come from?

HENRY

Nowhere in particular.

HENRY

I go where I will and I do what I

must.

(stops, drinks)

That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've

what you might call... 'in exile'.

SIMON

Why are you in trouble?

HENRY

(stopping)

An honest man is always in trouble,

Simon. Remember that.

SIMON

How do you know my name?

SIMON

(stopping him)

I am not retarded.

HENRY

(pauses)

Well... I'll take your word for that.

SIMON

(explaining)

People. I mean. They think. You know.

Because.

HENRY

I see.

HENRY

Here. Take this. And...

HENRY

...this. Keep them with you at all

times. You ever feel like you got

something to say and you can't get

it out, stop and write it down. OK?

SIMON

What are these?

HENRY

(proudly, returning)

This? This is my life's work. My

memoirs. My 'Confession'.

SIMON

(carefully)

What have you done?

HENRY

(wistfully)

I've been bad. Repeatedly.

(shrugs and steps

away)

But why brag? The details of my

exploits are only a pretext for a

far more expansive consideration of

general truths.

(contemplating the

notebooks)

What is this? It's a philosophy. A

poetics. A politics, if you will. A

literature of protest. A novel of

ideas. A pornographic magazine of

truly comic-book proportions. It is,

in the end, whatever the hell I want

it to be. And when I'm through with

it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide

straight through the world's own

idea of itself!

HENRY

(throwing down his

cigarette)

Come on, let's go break their arms!

SIMON

No!

SIMON

(pauses)

If I'm quiet.

HENRY

Once. I forget where I was. Central

America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid

job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and

water so foul the natives wouldn't

even piss in it. This crowd of drunken

motherfuckers hired by the local

drug cartel shows up at my hotel

room and threatens to tear me limb

from limb. And I say, listen, hombres,

OK, you've got me outnumbered four

to one and you're gunna kill me here

tonight and not a soul in this dimly

lit world is ever gunna notice I'm

gone. Fine. But one of you... one of

you... one of you is gunna have his

eye torn out. Period. Silence. I

repeat myself. One of you poor,

underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye

ripped out of its socket. I promise.

It's a small thing, perhaps, all

things considered. But I will succeed.

Because it's the only thing I have

left to do in this world. So why

don't you just take a good look at

one another one last time and think

it over for a few minutes more.

(smokes, waits)

They sober up a little, look at their

shoes in confusion, then step out

into the hall to talk among

themselves.

SIMON

What happened?

HENRY

(winking)

Well, here I am, still, after all.

MARY

(off)

Did you throw up all over some girl?

MARY

They were throwing bottles at the

house.

MARY

(gesturing to Fay's

room)

She's got some ex-con in there she

met at the bar. Tattoos all over

himself and a big red bloated nose.

SIMON

Did you take your pills?

SIMON

You want me to tell her to be quiet?

MARY

What's the use? She might as well

get it while she can. She's not always

gunna have the ass she has now, you

know. That's just how life is.

HENRY

Good morning, Simon! Glorious day,

huh? Here, have a donut. Can you

lend me twenty dollars?

HENRY

Thanks. Where's the library in the

scruffy little burgh?

SIMON

(handing him cash)

Down the highway about a mile and a

half and then make a left.

HENRY

Excellent! I'm polishing up the final

chapters of my 'Confession' and I

need a reasonably well-stocked

reference section.

HENRY

What's this?

SIMON

I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to.

Maybe.

HENRY

Can I take this?

HENRY

I'll correct the spelling.

SIMON

(weakly, unheard)

One of you is gunna lose an eye.

SIMON

(screaming)

One of you is gunna lose an eye!

SIMON

One of you. I promise.

SIMON

You can set me on fire. But one of

you is gunna have an eye torn out of

your head. I promise.

WARREN

Fuck.

AMY

Take me home.

HENRY

(scared)

Simon! Who did this to you?

SIMON

I was gunna tear out their eyes. I

knew I could do it.

HENRY

Whose eyes?

SIMON

I told them. Like you said. I told

them. And I knew I could do it.

MR DENG

You should take him home. He smells

like a toilet.

FAY

(calling)

Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a

hospital!

SIMON

No!

FAY

Oh, shut up! Turn around.

MARY

This kinda thing has happened before.

HENRY

(standing)

It won't happen again.

MARY

How do you know?

HENRY

This your husband?

MARY

Stop that.

MR DENG

(nods to Mary, then)

Mr Fool, what is this?

HENRY

It's poetry.

MR DENG

Are you sure?

HENRY

Of course I'm sure. I corrected the

spelling myself.

MR DENG

It made my daughter sing.

HENRY

Yeah, well, you know -- that's what

poetry does.

MR DENG

But she has never spoken in her life.

SIMON

Owww!!!

FAY

Keep still!

SIMON

Let me do it!

FAY

(fed up)

Fine! You do it, Simon! I don't care!

FAY

Mom! Simon's got a broken rib, his

shoulder's dislocated or something,

and he won't let me disinfect the

gash in his head!

MARY

Fay, just take him to the hospital,

will ya!

FAY

(stamping her foot)

But he won't go!

MARY

(screaming)

Simon Grim, you go to the hospital

with Fay right now, do hear me!

HENRY

We gotta talk.

HENRY

What the hell were you trying to do

when you wrote this thing?

SIMON

Nothing.

HENRY

Well, you know you wrote it in a

kind of iambic pentameter.

SIMON

Iambic what?

HENRY

Verse.

HENRY

Look, in my opinion, this is pretty

powerful stuff. Though your spelling

is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a

little naive, your instincts are

profound. But the whole thing needs

to be given a more cohesive shape.

It can be expanded. Followed through.

Unified.

(smokes, then)

You see what I'm getting at?

HENRY

Are you willing to commit yourself

to this? To really work on it? To

give it its due? In the face of

adversity and discouragement? To

rise to the challenge you yourself

have set?

HENRY

And don't gimme that wonderstruck

'I'm-only-a-humble-garbage-man'

bullshit, either.

SIMON

It hurts to breathe.

HENRY

(nodding)

Of course it does.

SIMON

Like this?

HENRY

Yeah. No. OK?

SIMON

Wait!

HENRY

Don't move! Fuck. There.

SIMON

Are you sure that's right?

HENRY

Yes. Now shut up and lie back.

SIMON

Is this gunna hurt?

HENRY

Yes.

HENRY

You gunna be alright?

HENRY

Here. Bite on this.

SIMON

(spots blood on it)

What's that?

HENRY

(looking)

It's blood. From your head. Lie back.

Shove that in your mouth and hold on

to something.

HENRY

Okay. You ready?

SIMON

Aaagghhh!!!!!!!

FAY

So, do you have, like, you know, a

girlfriend, Henry?

HENRY

No.

FAY

Do you find me attractive?

HENRY

Yes, I do.

FAY

I look young for my age, don't I?

HENRY

How old are you?

FAY

How old do you think I am?

HENRY

You look young.

FAY

(playfully)

How young?

HENRY

I don't know. Young.

FAY

But how... I mean, do I look more

like twenty, or... you know, thirty?

HENRY

Thirty.

FAY

Listen, you geek, after a couple of

drinks plenty of people mistake me

for eighteen!

VICKY

Hey, Warren, are you a registered

voter?

WARREN

Bug off, Vicky!

WARREN

(reading)

'Saving America From Itself.' What

the fuck is this?

VICKY

It's everything you need to know

about the upcoming elections and

congressman Owen Feer and all the

really good things he wants to do

for our country.

WARREN

Oh yeah, like what?

VICKY

He wants to win back this country

for us Americans, Warren, and restore

some kind of cultural-moral standard

to our way of life.

WARREN

What time's your kid go off to school?

VICKY

(carefully)

Nine o'clock.

WARREN

How about I come over and visit you

later?

VICKY

Well, I don't know, Warren. I mean...

WARREN

Come on. I mean it. I'm trying to

change.

VICKY

(screaming at Mr Deng)

How dare you put something like this

up where anyone can see it!

MR DENG

(to Vicky)

It's poetry.

VICKY

It's pornography! The product of a

diseased mind! You oughta be ashamed

of yourself, Mr Deng!

MR DENG

It made Gnoc sing.

VICKY

(pauses, confused)

It's disgusting! There oughta be a

law or something!

HENRY

(winking)

There's no accounting for taste, is

there, Mr Deng?

HENRY

See, Simon, there are three kinds of

there. There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E.

There are the donuts. Then there's T-

H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It

is their donut. Then, finally, there's

'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A

contraction, meaning they are. They're

the donut people. Get it?

SIMON

Uh-huh.

HENRY

And look, if you're gunna read

Wordsworth you've gotta get a more

up-to-date edition. This odoriferous

tome you're so attached to doesn't

even have all fourteen books of the

Prelude. And you need notes.

Commentary. I'll go to the library

and find you the best edition they

have.

SIMON

Thank you, but that's OK. I'll stop

there on my way back from work. Well,

yes, maybe not today, but, you know,

tomorrow, probably.

HENRY

Quit.

SIMON

My job?

HENRY

Yeah.

SIMON

Why?

HENRY

You need time to write, Simon. To

study. To reflect.

SIMON

But I like my job.

HENRY

We all have to make sacrifices. A

vocation like ours, Simon, is not a

nine to five thing. You can't put a

fence around a man's soul. We think

and feel where and when we can think

and feel. We are the servants of our

muse and we toil where she commands.

SIMON

She's clinically depressed.

HENRY

Yeah, and what's that mean?

SIMON

(thinking, then)

I guess it means it's not her fault.

HENRY

(sighing)

You ever think of leaving?

SIMON

Here?

HENRY

Yeah.

SIMON

To go where?

HENRY

Out there. You know, into the world.

Where ever.

SIMON

Yeah, I guess.

HENRY

(reciting)

'Opportunity will step away and make

room for a man to pass it by.'

SIMON

Is that from your book?

HENRY

No. I found it in a fortune cookie.

SIMON

Can I read your confession?

HENRY

No. Not yet. Soon. We'll see.

SIMON

Is it almost finished?

HENRY

(puffing himself up)

Well, you know, Simon, a piece of

work like this, it's... A vocation

like ours... You can't put a fence

around a man's soul. What I'm trying

to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a

lifetime really. It's a life's work.

(looking around)

But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate

your feedback. I gotta go. See ya.

MARY

What are you doing there, Simon?

SIMON

I'm writing a poem.

PAT

So what? It ain't so great.

CHRIS

(to Amy, of Simon)

That him?

AMY

(off)

Pardon me, Simon.

AMY

Uhm. Look, ah... I'm the editor of

the high school newspaper now and...

PAT

One of the editors.

AMY

One of the editors, and we...

PAT

You.

AMY

I... wanted to know if we could print

your poem in this month's issue.

SIMON

Why?

AMY

Because I think it's great.

PAT

I don't.

CHRIS

(to Pat)

Who cares what you think?

TED

You're a drag.

CHRIS

A well-known drag.

AMY

(to Simon)

Please?

FAY

Ma, you take your medication?

FAY

(to herself)

Guess so.

HENRY

Evening, Fay.

FAY

(disdainfully)

What do you want?

HENRY

I've got these books for Simon.

FAY

Well, leave 'em there on the counter,

then.

WARREN

Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?

WARREN

Immigrant.

FAY

Where is he?

FAY

Henry?

FAY

(screaming)

Mommy!!!!!

MARY

You bastard!

HENRY

What?

MARY

Get out!

HENRY

Listen. I know a man. He's a big

shot in the publishing business.

Angus James. Smart, adventurous and

tons of integrity. When this thing

is ready, I'll recommend he reads

it. He'll respect my opinion.

SIMON

A man was here today looking for

you.

HENRY

(alert)

What man?

SIMON

I don't know. He drove by the house

a few times.

HENRY

Why do they torment me like this?

Why? They're like a bunch of fucking

mosquitoes!

SIMON

What do they want from you?

HENRY

They want to suffocate me, Simon!

They wanna extinguish me like a flame!

TIM

But why?

HENRY

They're afraid, that's why! They're

afraid of what I might do! What I

might say! Think! They're afraid of

my ideas!

HENRY

You and I are alike in this way,

Simon.

SIMON

Yeah?

HENRY

We're outsiders. We think and feel

too much and too deeply. And the

world can't handle that. Our mere

existence is a threat to its illusion

of security. Sure, they'll name a

wing of a new library after us when

we're dead! But now... Now, when

we're alive... Now, they wanna burn

us at the stake!

HENRY

Scram.

HENRY

For example, I made love to your

mother about half an hour ago and

now I'm beginning to think that maybe

it wasn't such a good idea.

HENRY

I mean to say, I think Fay may be

jealous.

SIMON

I don't want to think about this.

HENRY

Bad move, Simon.

HENRY

(pointing at him)

A poet has got to be able to think

about anything.

SIMON

Am I really a poet?

HENRY

Of course you are! A great poet! But

you need experience. You need to do

something to be ashamed of every

once in a while, for cryin' out loud.

HENRY

Come on! Let's go out! There's a den

of iniquity right across the street!

You got any money?

MARY

That man's a bad influence.

SIMON

On who?

DISSOLVE TO:

HENRY

(shoving him)

Simon. Hey, Simon.

(Simon wakes)

Come on. I got ya some coffee.

SIMON

What's this?

HENRY

It's a computer. You write on it.

HENRY

Here's the manual.

SIMON

Where'd you get it?

HENRY

I stole it. Now listen. Remember how

yesterday we discussed the relative

desirability of cadence in relation

to the readability of...

FAY

(off)

Oh, shit! Not you again!

HENRY

Simon, I can't work under these

conditions.

FAY

Yeah! Get outta here, you freak!

HENRY

Get a life!

FAY

Eat shit and die, Henry!

MARY

(screaming)

Beast! Fiend! Rapist!

FAY

Oh, shut up, Mom!

SIMON

Henry, wait up!

HENRY

I am not a rapist!

HENRY

Shit. Come on, this way.

HENRY

Keep a look out. Tell me when he's

gone.

SIMON

Henry, what's going on? Who is that

guy? What's he want?

HENRY

He wants to help me! He wants to be

my friend.

SIMON

Help you with what?

HENRY

(suddenly)

Shhh!

HENRY

What's wrong?

FATHER HAWKES

I doubt.

HENRY

So, you're an honest man. Why beat

yourself up about it?

FATHER HAWKES

I don't know if there are grounds

for faith. Is my vocation relevant?

Does it make a difference?

SIMON

A difference in what?

FATHER HAWKES

The world. The way it is. Is this a

way to help relieve suffering?

HENRY

Your vocation makes a difference.

FATHER HAWKES

How can you be so sure?

HENRY

Because vocation is the difference.

Only someone who really cares doubts.

Listen, father, as I was about to

tell my friend Simon here, I am,

without doubt, the biggest sinner

within a hundred miles of this parish.

But still, I've gotta stay up late

at night to outdo the unending parade

of mundane little atrocities I see

committed every day right out in the

open spaces of this loud and sunlit

culture we call home.

FATHER HAWKES

You seem to me to be a sensitive and

generous man.

HENRY

I like to think so. But the fact is

I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless,

I insist your vocation makes a

difference, because to hold out

anything other than a spiritual

yardstick to reality is to be jerking

off grandly into the abyss. Listen,

have you got any money? Let's go

have a drink.

WARREN

Excuse me, miss, are you a registered

voter?

MISS

Oh God, really I don't know.

WARREN

Well, I'd like to give you some

information about Congressman Owen

Feer. This man is gunna make a big

difference in the lives of every

American in the years to come...

MISS

Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks.

WARREN

Pardon me, sir...

BILL

Fuck off!

WARREN

Right.

WARREN

What time's your mother get off work?

WARREN

Fay, are you a registered voter?

FAY

(stopping)

Don't you dare talk that way to me!

And keep your hands off my brother.

Pearl, what are you doing here?

WARREN

I'm watchin' her.

FAY

You and Vicky get back together?

WARREN

I gotta regular job now and

everything.

FAY

I saw this retard on TV this morning.

WARREN

He's gunna be the next president of

the United States of America, Fay.

FAY

Keep dreamin' Warren. The guy's a

Nazi.

WARREN

I like him!

FAY

Gimme a light.

WARREN

(lighting her cigarette)

He's a decent man. He takes

complicated issues and totally

simplifies them. And I appreciate

that.

FAY

You still sell dope?

WARREN

No. You know what the problem is

with this country, Fay? Me. I'm the

problem. We live in a culture of

poverty and crime, where the work

ethic is undermined and male

responsibility is made irrelevant.

FAY

Come on, Pearl, let's go play at my

house.

WARREN

She gives you any trouble, Fay, you

just let me know.

FATHER HAWKES

Do you think human beings are innately

bad?

HENRY

Worse than bad! Monstrous! But I

love that about them.

(banging on the bar)

Wake up, Simon!

WARREN

Jesus Christ, Simon, you're letting

yourself go to hell! You read that

flyer I gave you?

SIMON

What?

WARREN

Simon, wake up and smell the coffee,

huh! It's up to guys like you and me

to help create a better tomorrow!

WARREN

(to Vicky)

Why would I steal a computer from

the campaign office?

VICKY

I'm not saying you did, I'm just

saying one was and since you do have

this criminal background...

WARREN

(pointing)

Don't judge me!

BUNUEL

Look, I know you know him. People

have seen you around together.

BUNUEL

I'm his parole officer.

SIMON

What did he do?

BUNUEL

I'm not supposed to talk about that

stuff with people.

SIMON

He's my. Friend.

BUNUEL

Mr Deng says you're some sort of a

poet, or something.

BUNUEL

You tell Henry to call me -- Officer

Bunuel -- pronto! Or they're gunna

chuck his ass straight back into

jail! Got it?

WARREN

Vicky, look I'm sorry.

VICKY

Don't you even come near me!

FAY

What do you mean, you quit?

SIMON

I quit my job.

FAY

Why!

SIMON

There are things I want to do.

FAY

Like what?

SIMON

'Opportunity will step out of the

way to let a man... pass it by.'

FAY

Are you drunk?

SIMON

Now you have to go out and get a

job!

FAY

I am not gettin' a job!

(paces, then)

Who's gunna look after Mom!

SIMON

I will.

FAY

Pearl, go outside.

SIMON

If you treat Mom like a sick person,

she's gunna stay like... you know, a

sick person.

FAY

Simon, don't be retarded...

SIMON

(banging the table)

I am not retarded!

SIMON

I can see with my own eyes.

FAY

Mom can't be left alone with no one

to keep an eye on her.

SIMON

Well, who's been keeping an eye on

her while you've been out getting

fucked by every OTB winner in town?

SIMON

Aggghhhh!!!

FAY

(sniffling)

What happened to her, Simon? How did

she get this way? Will it happen to

me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked

up?

SIMON

(approaching)

Henry?

HENRY

(looking up and rising)

Simon! What are you doing here?

SIMON

Henry... Your parole officer, Officer

Bunuel, came by again today.

SIMON

He told me to tell you that if you

don't call him they're gunna put you

back in jail.

HENRY

Simon...

SIMON

He gave me this number...

HENRY

Simon...

SIMON

He was talking to Mr Deng too, and,

well, you know, I was thinking...

HENRY

Simon, just shut the fuck up!

HENRY

Forgive me.

HENRY

Forgive me, Simon.

SIMON

Call him, Henry. Please.

HENRY

OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a

library card?

SIMON

Yeah.

HENRY

Check this out for me.

HENRY

Milton. Seventeenth century. English.

You see, Simon, it's important my

'Confession' dig up the past, comb

previous evidence and help chart the

historic -- even the aesthetic --

inevitability of my ideas. And...

HENRY

This place is crawling with chicks,

Simon. Wander around. Leer a little.

Cop a feel. Impose yourself on 'em.

See what happens.

SIMON

I make girls uncomfortable.

HENRY

Bullshit! You've got a rough hewn

charm that sets 'em on edge. Now,

listen, I gotta go.

SIMON

Henry?

SIMON

What did you do?

HENRY

I got caught.

SIMON

(voice over)

'Whereto with speedy words the arch-

fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be

weak is miserable...'

SIMON

(voice-over)

Why is it this beautiful girl makes

me sad? Does she know how beautiful

she is? Do people tell her? Does she

ever feel stupid?

SIMON

Why don't I smile when she looks at

me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.

SIMON

Her figure makes me violent. I want

to somehow break her. But tenderly.

How is this possible? Ask Henry.

SIMON

(voice-over)

I can't breathe.

SIMON

(voice-over)

Why do I do this to myself? And why

do I reduce you to only one

possibility? These are not even

questions anymore. I know the answers

myself. This isn't a page of notes.

It's a letter. A letter to you. A

desperate act. You are a miracle to

me. I can't breathe.

BUNUEL

How are you, Henry?

HENRY

(frowning)

Peachy. Gimme a light.

BUNUEL

Have you found a job?

BUNUEL

How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous

meetings, did you go over and visit

them yet?

HENRY

What happened to this assistant

librarian position you were supposed

to set me up with?

BUNUEL

I tried, Henry. I really did.

HENRY

So what happened?

BUNUEL

Henry, with your background... Well,

I mean, with your record, they didn't

think it'd be right to have you at

the neighborhood library.

HENRY

Why not?

BUNUEL

They thought you'd be a bad influence

on the kids.

BUNUEL

(adds)

Or worse.

HENRY

So my word is not enough. My promise

worthless. The fact I've served my

time nothing but the emblem of my

continuing guilt.

BUNUEL

Apparently.

FAY

What's up?

SIMON

(guiltily)

Nothing.

FAY

I'm creating my resume. This

computer's got a program especially

for it. I bought some special

stationery too. It's scented. Look.

FAY

It's roses.

SIMON

Can you type my poem into that thing?

FAY

(shocked)

That's your poem?

SIMON

Yeah.

FAY

(smokes, then)

Simon, Mom's right about you. A poem's

supposed to be a small, delicate

kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle.

Look at this. You've made a fuckin'

telephone book.

HENRY

I was caught. Yes, I was caught...

once. I was caught in flagranti

delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old

girl named Susan. She was an ugly

and mean-spirited kid, but she knew

how to play upon my weaknesses which,

I admit, are deep and many.

HENRY

You appear shocked.

SIMON

(he is)

Sorry.

HENRY

It was a pathetic little conspiracy.

A transparently desperate attempt to

discredit me and my ideas; to label

me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be

ashamed of such a thing. As if

Socrates himself hadn't been taken

out of circulation for corrupting

the youth of Athens!

HENRY

Seven years. Seven years for one

afternoon of blissful transgression.

But what of it? Who cares? Prison's

not so bad; particularly if one's a

sex offender, free from the popular

and conventional horror of sodomy.

HENRY

They were not 'lost years'.

HENRY

I put them to good use. I began my

major work. My opus.

HENRY

Believe me, Simon, this incident

with the girl, prison... It pales to

insignificance in the wider context

of my career.

HENRY

Nothing in comparison to the day my

'Confession' is unleashed.

(beginning to pace)

What an orgy we'll have then, huh?

What shouts of outrage from the

offended populace, from the

sanctimonious purveyors of culture

and quality, the righteous defenders

of what ever inane and haphazard

notion of progress then in vogue.

They'll be beside themselves with

fiercely reasoned critical analysis.

Apoplectic with indignation!

HENRY

Their feelings will be hurt.

HENRY

Yes, like a mirror which reflects

only the inside of the person before

it, my 'Confession' will lovingly

render humanity's common monstrosity

in all of its lurid wide screen glory.

HENRY

Why should I blush or feel shame

before the common lot of humanity,

anyway, for a few banal and, again I

admit, inelegant transgressions?

HENRY

After all, really, I'm doing

civilization a favor.

SIMON

When can I read it?

HENRY

Soon.

FATHER HAWKES

We are told not to judge. But to

forgive. Not to look into our

neighbor's eye to find the bad, but

to find the good.

(pacing)

Now this is difficult. I admit.

(pause)

But having a good friend is not always

easy.

SIMON

Yes, but... do you think Henry is...

dangerous?

FATHER HAWKES

He needs help. Our help. Yours

especially.

SIMON

But what can I do?

FATHER HAWKES

The best parts of himself come to

the surface when he's helping someone

learn. I've seen this. Let yourself

be taught. Show your appreciation

for his guidance. In this way, you

know, perhaps. Well. There's hope

for everyone. Even. Even Henry.

FAY

Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex,

will ya?

TIM

The violence of the imagery reminds

me of early Clash, while the lyricism

of the verse recalls, for me, Walt

Whitman.

BIBI

I would have said Dickinson, maybe

even Eliot, and so on. But I agree

with the punk roots...

HENRY

The greats all say the same thing:

little. And what little there is to

be said is immense. Or, in other

words, follow your own genius to

where it leads without regard for

the apparent needs of the world at

large, which, in fact, has no needs

as such, but, rather, moments of

exhaustion in which it is incapable

of prejudice.

(drinks)

We can only hope to collide with

these moments of unselfconsciousness.

This divine fatigue... this...

FAY

(sitting)

Push over.

HENRY

As I tried to make plain in Paris:

'Nous savons que nous avons chute

parce que nous savons qui nous

sommes.' 'We know we have fallen

because we know who we are.'

FAY

(skeptically)

When were you in Paris?

HENRY

(interrupted)

That's beside the point. But did

they listen to me? Of course not!

SIMON

You alright, Fay?

FAY

(lighting a cigarette)

No, I'm not alright! Your poem brought

my period on a week and half early!

So just shut up. Everybody just shut

up!

HENRY

For is this not the best of all

possible worlds? Are not the evils

of this world necessary components

of a cosmos that could not exist

without them?

CHRIS

So, do you believe in God?

HENRY

(smokes, shrugs)

Unfortunately.

FAY

(lifting her head)

Yeah, but when were you in Paris?

HENRY

(aggravated)

At. One. Time.

CHRIS

Simon, can I have your autograph?

HENRY

Go ahead. But never let yourself be

flattered.

FAY

(to Henry)

So what about this friend of yours,

Hot Shot? The publisher.

HENRY

Who?

SIMON

(reminding him)

Angus James.

FAY

Yeah. Angus James. How about sending

this poem to him?

HENRY

Because it's not done yet.

FAY

(to Simon)

When's it gunna be done, Simon?

SIMON

I don't know.

FAY

Well, you oughta be home writing

instead of hanging out over here

with all your groupies.

AMY

Hey, I'm not a groupie.

FAY

Pardon me, swivel-hips. Is that your

PowerBook?

AMY

Yeah.

FAY

Can I see it?

HENRY

(continues)

The thing to do is to send parts of

it to different magazines and literary

journals first. That kinda thing.

You know. Substantiate it.

AMY

(looking up)

What's 'scatalogical' mean?

HENRY

Filth, child. A preoccupation with

excrement. Why?

AMY

That's what the Board of Education

called Simon's poem, yesterday;

scatological.

EDNA

Hello?

FAY

Yeah, I'm listening.

EDNA

My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write

the human interest column for the

Queens County Examiner and I was

just wondering if I could have a

word with Simon Grim?

FAY

Simon!

EDNA

(startled)

Thank you.

FAY

You can't talk to him for, you know,

too long or anything, 'cause he's

gotta, you know... he writes all

day. That's all he does. Can you

believe that?

FAY

(calling again)

Hey! Simon! Get down here!

FAY

Simon, this is Edna. She's from the

newspaper.

EDNA

(rapid fire)

Simon, the Parents' Association at

the local high school are calling

your poem pornography. The teachers

are defending the students' right to

exercise their critical tastes and

sensibilities. The county agrees

with the Church and considers the

poem emblematic of modern society's

moral disintegration. How do you

feel about these controversial

reactions to your poem?

FAY

(punching him)

Simon, answer the woman.

MARY

I need my prescription filled.

FAY

Mom, this is Edna. Edna, Mom.

EDNA

Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a

child?

MARY

We all thought he was retarded.

FAY

Everyone did.

MARY

Never said a word.

FAY

He masturbated constantly.

MARY

Had no friends.

FAY

Till he met Henry.

MARY

And that's when all the trouble really

started.

SIMON

(reading)

Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine

consider ourselves and the publication

open-minded and cutting edge and

have consistently printed the work

of the most brilliant and farseeing

young talent of the day. Every week

we are forced to return writing which

we can not for one reason or another

publish and include a brief but polite

refusal. But this tract you've sent

us demands a response as violent as

the effect your words have had upon

us. Drop dead. Keep your day job.

Sincerely, The Editors.

HENRY

De gustibus non disputandum est.

SIMON

(thinking)

You can't argue with taste?

HENRY

About taste. You can't argue about

taste. God, Simon.

SIMON

The other twenty-five are almost as

bad. I don't know why I bother.

HENRY

What do you mean you don't know why

you bother? You bother because you

know the poem is excellent!

SIMON

Do I?

HENRY

Of course you do!

SIMON

I'm not so sure sometimes.

HENRY

Can you sit there, look me straight

in the eye, and tell me you don't

think this poem is great? That it is

not at once a work of great lyrical

beauty and ethical depth? That it is

not a genuine, highly individual,

and profound meditation on the miracle

of existence?

SIMON

I, ah...

HENRY

Can you?

SIMON

No. I can't.

HENRY

So, you see, you have no choice!

SIMON

(calling)

Can you recommend it to your friend,

the publisher?

SIMON

Henry? Can you recommend the poem to

him?

SIMON

I mean, I think it's finished and,

for better or worse, it is book

length.

HENRY

That might not be as easy as it seems.

SIMON

Why?

HENRY

Well, it's been a long time. My name

might not carry as much weight as it

once did with Angus.

SIMON

But he's your friend, right?

HENRY

We were close at one time.

SIMON

You said he respected your opinion.

HENRY

Look, Simon, opinions come and go.

HENRY

To be honest; my ideas, my writing,

they haven't always been received

well or even calmly. They're

upsetting. I'm a controversial man.

HENRY

You see, what I'm doing is too

radical. Too uncompromising. It'll

take time for people to see its value.

It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or

maybe just...

(stops)

A recommendation from me might do

you as much harm as it does good.

SIMON

Henry, why can't I read the

'Confession'?

HENRY

Because certain work needs to be

experienced all at once in order for

one to appreciate the full force of

its character.

FAY

Simon, wake up! The guy's in a dream

world!

SIMON

He's afraid that his reputation will

prevent people from giving my work

an honest chance.

FAY

His reputation as what?

SIMON

As a writer.

FAY

Gimme a break.

SIMON

He's kinda like in exile. Marginalized

on account of his ideas.

FAY

If he's such a great big fat genius,

why doesn't he write books? Like you

do.

SIMON

He has. He's written a book. It's

almost completed. He's been working

on it for years. It's just not

published.

FAY

Yeah, I bet. It's probably disgusting.

SIMON

(defensively)

It's a quite serious and difficult

piece of work, apparently.

FAY

Have you read it?

SIMON

No. Not yet. Soon. Certain work needs

to be experienced all at once in

order for one to appreciate the full

force of its character.

FAY

Yeah, well, what ever. Listen, Simon,

forget Henry. Go straight up to this

Angus James character yourself and

make him read your poem.

FAY

I'm gunna apply for a job at the one-

hour photo joint and then go over to

the Mall to see about that job in

the bank. Make sure Mom takes her

pills. See ya.

SIMON

Please don't stop.

SIMON

That was nice what you were playing.

MARY

Yes, it was nice. But it was

unremarkable.

SIMON

Does that matter?

MARY

(looking right at him)

Yes. It does.

MARY

Simon?

LAURA

Hi, I'll take that.

LAURA

Aren't you the messenger?

SIMON

No.

LAURA

Are you here to fix the plumbing?

SIMON

I'm here to see Mr. Angus James.

LAURA

(amused)

Are you?

SIMON

I'm not a plumber. Or a messenger. I

was once a garbage man. But now I'm

a poet.

BARRY

The book, as we know it, Angus, will

be a thing of the past within the

next few years. Novels, articles,

newspapers will all be downloaded on

to our personal computers anyway.

ANGUS

So you're telling me to get out of

the publishing business?

STEVE

No. But we've got to re-invent the

publishing business for the electronic

age.

ANGUS

Yes, Laura?

LAURA

I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen,

but... Angus, there's a particularly

wound-up young garbage man out here

who seems to have written a poem. A

long poem. And I recall how, at last

month's meeting, you stressed the

need for us to be on the look-out

for more marginalized verse from

unestablished quarters of the American

scene.

ANGUS

Did I say that?

STEVE

Yeah. You did.

BARRY

Twice.

ANGUS

Well, OK. Make an appointment, Laura.

Sometime next month.

LAURA

Right-e-o.

ANGUS

(returning)

So, anyway, how is the digital

revolution going to help me sell

books?

SIMON

Why can't I see him now?

LAURA

(sincerely)

Because he's a very important man

and, well, you're not.

LAURA

Be reasonable.

SIMON

Why?

ANGUS

I don't think people are going to

prefer reading books on television,

Steve.

STEVE

It won't be television!

BARRY

It'll be interactive.

STEVE

Angus, look, we have a number of

charts here...

BARRY

In every home in America the PC will

be where the TV used to be.

STEVE

And it'll be a direct connection to

all forms of media.

BARRY

An unprecedented transformation of

American social life...

STEVE

We'll all become better informed,

more literate, increasingly

productive, and... Well, and, like I

said, we have a number of charts...

LAURA

Sorry to disturb you again, gentlemen,

but... Angus, I'd like to call

security for this one. Though, before

I do, I just wanted to ask just how

marginal the as yet undiscovered

voice of American poetry should be?

ANGUS

(thinking)

Pretty damn marginal, I'd think.

BARRY

Down right controversial, probably.

ANGUS

How's he strike you?

LAURA

He's been denounced by his local

Board of Education.

BARRY

Oh, I read about him in the paper.

Hangs out in a delicatessen somewhere

and writes pornography.

ANGUS

Hello, and why do you think I should

take valuable time out of my busy

schedule to read...

ANGUS

This?

SIMON

Because it's a masterpiece.

ANGUS

Really?

SIMON

Yes.

ANGUS

(to Laura)

Are you hearing this?

LAURA

He's adorable.

SIMON

I wouldn't want to waste your time.

ANGUS

I'm sure you wouldn't and I appreciate

you being so straightforward.

SIMON

Thank you.

ANGUS

I assume you can take straightforward

criticism?

LAURA

Just say 'Yes'.

SIMON

(looking back)

Maybe.

ANGUS

Get him a coffee, Laura.

LAURA

Have a seat, Mr Grim.

ANGUS

Hold my calls for the next half hour.

LAURA

What about Steve?

ANGUS

He doesn't drink coffee. Steve, do

you drink coffee?

STEVE

(off)

Angus, listen to me!

HENRY

In the infinite amplitude of his

love, God wants to create the largest

number of best elements that can

exist together in one cosmos... OK.

HENRY

In an instantaneous calculation made

in eternity, God computes the best

possible world and creates it. Fine.

This 'decision' by God is uncontingent

and eternal rather than temporally

or ontologically sequential.

AMY

How do you spell that?

HENRY

What?

AMY

Ontologically.

HENRY

O-N-T... Don't you have some kinda

spell-check on that thing?

AMY

Never mind.

HENRY

It is impossible for every perfect

good to be compatible with every

other perfect good. The intense beauty

of the mountain must be set off by

the fertility of the plain, so to

speak.

HENRY

The good of freewill must entail

real choices for sin.

HENRY

Listen, Amy, back off. I'm on parole.

AMY

You feel the same way. I can tell. I

can see it when you look at me.

HENRY

Hey! I don't look at you.

AMY

Yes you do. In the street. In the

parking lot yesterday. That night on

the highway.

HENRY

I look at a lot of people that way.

AMY

You think I'm stupid.

HENRY

No, as a matter of fact, I think

you're a real bright kid and I like

that about you.

AMY

(looks up, pouts)

You do?

HENRY

I like it so much I've got half a

mind to do perverse things to you.

Right here. Right now. Things you

might just learn to like.

ANGUS

This is really quite unbelievably

bad, my friend. I mean, I'm all for

experimentation and I've made a career

out of a healthy disregard for

convention, but... Look, this is

profoundly irrelevant material. This

is only my opinion. But it's an

opinion I value highly. Goodnight,

Laura. Call Norton Press. We're still

on for tomorrow.

ANGUS

I've been wrong before as a publisher.

But I refuse to admit I've ever been

wrong as a reader. You have talent,

I admit. You have an innate sense of

the musicality of language. A good

ear, maybe. But you do nothing

significant with it. And this twisted

reasoning that poses as... conviction

or insight, it's... well, it's

embarrassing.

ANGUS

Why did you bring this thing to me,

anyway?

SIMON

(weakly)

A friend of mine spoke of you. He

said you had a lot of integrity.

ANGUS

Yes, well, of course, I do. But I'm

not crazy, am I? Who is this person?

Do I know him?

SIMON

Henry Fool.

ANGUS

Never heard of him.

LAURA

(off)

I remember Henry.

LAURA

He used to be the janitor here.

MR DENG

(off)

Henry, put those magazines back.

HENRY

I'm just looking at the pictures.

MR DENG

It's not good for you.

HENRY

I learn so much from these magazines,

Mr Deng. I refuse to discriminate

between modes of knowing.

MR DENG

And you can't smoke in here anymore.

HENRY

Why not!

MR DENG

It's the law.

HENRY

This place is losing all its charm,

Mr Deng.

MR DENG

Business is good. The kids, they

hang out all day and drink coffee,

talk about art and read poetry.

HENRY

It's just a fad, Mr Deng. These kids

today, they're just slaves to fashion.

FAY

Anybody home? Mom?

FAY

Ma, that you?

HENRY

Come on, Mr Deng! How much do I owe

you?

MR DENG

Twenty-five dollars.

HENRY

That can't be right! And so what? My

credit's good.

WARREN

Henry!

HENRY

Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of

bucks I can borrow?

WARREN

Listen, Henry, I wanna remind you to

vote this Thursday.

HENRY

Ah, yes, of course. When noble minds

shrink from the task of leadership

scoundrels will rush in to fill the

void.

(takes cash)

Thanks.

WARREN

It's every American's right. A

blessing. Yet another opportunity to

save America from itself.

FAY

Hey, Henry, you in there? Gimme a

cigarette.

FAY

Henry?

AMY

Henry?

HENRY

Yeah.

AMY

What kind of... Well, I mean... What

kind of... perverse things would you

do to me?

HENRY

Take a powder, cupcake.

AMY

No, really.

HENRY

Evaporate!

DISSOLVE TO:

FATHER HAWKES

Let us pray. Lord, grant that peace

be within reach for our friend, Mary.

May the pain and confusion she endured

on earth be fought through in the

after life, so that she may enter

the Kingdom of Heaven and live in

the light of God. Amen.

HENRY

So I was a janitor! So what?

SIMON

But Angus James said he didn't even

know you!

HENRY

Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom

buddies or anything. But we used to

talk sometimes. In the elevator. In

the morning. He said he liked my

ideas. Being a janitor's a good job

if you're a writer. Especially the

night shift; all that time to think

and develop my ideas.

SIMON

Do it.

SIMON

Anyway, he hated my poem.

HENRY

Well, what the hell does he know? He

wouldn't know a vital piece of

literary art if it came up and bit

him in the leg. To hell with him!

He's not the only publisher in the

world!

SIMON

But nobody likes it.

HENRY

(smokes)

It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded

in his own land. Remember that.

SIMON

Do it.

HENRY

Hey, look, treasure!

HENRY

What is this?

SIMON

Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.

HENRY

It's a ring. Jewelry.

SIMON

I think it's a gasket. A fitting

from off of that old refrigerator

over there.

HENRY

Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering

around by the garbage dump.

WARREN

He lost.

HENRY

Who lost?

WARREN

Congressman Feer.

HENRY

(realizing)

Oh. Well, you know. Somebody's gotta

lose.

WARREN

What's the fucking use. You make

sacrifices. You try to be a decent

human being. Try to contribute

something meaningful to society. And

what happens? They lose to a bunch

of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups.

I don't give a shit anymore. People

deserve what they get.

HENRY

Vicky?

HENRY

What happened to you?

VICKY

He's a good man, Henry. Nobody's

perfect.

HENRY

I guess not.

VICKY

He's terribly disappointed.

HENRY

I found Pearl wandering around with

no shoes on her feet.

VICKY

Thanks. She gets scared.

HENRY

And you don't?

VICKY

I love him.

HENRY

(alarmed)

Where's the beer?

MR DENG

No more beer. Coffee. Espresso!

Cappuccino! Cafe au lait. Carrot

juice. Herbal tea.

HENRY

A double espresso and a jelly donut,

Gnoc.

(to Bunuel)

You mind paying? My credit's no good

here anymore, apparently.

BUNUEL

(nods amiably)

Did you go to the employment agency

today, Henry?

HENRY

No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try

to get me a job on the garbage truck.

BUNUEL

Listen, I'm a little concerned about

your friend.

HENRY

Simon?

BUNUEL

Seems he gave an obscene note to a

girl in the library.

HENRY

Get outta here! When?

BUNUEL

I'm not sure.

HENRY

It couldn't have been Simon.

BUNUEL

It almost certainly is. He mentions

you. Look...

HENRY

'Her figure makes me violent. I want

to somehow break her. But tenderly.

How is this possible? Ask Henry.'

HENRY

Bunuel, this is obviously a love

letter.

BUNUEL

(taking it back)

We've had complaints.

HENRY

Where did you get it?

BUNUEL

She posted it on the Internet.

HENRY

Oh, the slut!

BUNUEL

She was trying to warn other girls

about a potential rapist.

HENRY

(smokes)

Is all this true about the Internet?

About how you can get pornography on

it?

BUNUEL

Well, yeah, sure. It's a big problem.

You can send dirty pictures and

everything.

HENRY

On the Internet?

BUNUEL

Yeah.

HENRY

No kiddin'?

BUNUEL

See you on Thursday, Henry.

HENRY

(thinking)

Sure. See you.

(calls the waitress)

Gnoc, gimme one of these double

espressos to go, will ya?

HENRY

Hello, Fay.

FAY

Go away.

HENRY

You gotta get outta the house, Fay.

You can't blame yourself for not

being here. You did all you could

for her.

FAY

Is there something you want?

HENRY

You got the Internet on that

contraption?

FAY

(resumes typing)

Yeah. So what?

HENRY

Look Fay, about, you know, between

us -- what happened...

FAY

I don't wanna talk about it, Henry!

HENRY

Type a part of Simon's poem onto the

Internet.

FAY

(stops)

What?

HENRY

Go ahead.

FAY

No.

HENRY

Why not?

FAY

Because.

HENRY

Come on, Fay. It's a great idea.

FAY

I don't know if he would want us to

do that.

HENRY

Sure he would. Just the first ten

verses.

FAY

I don't know.

HENRY

He'll thank you for it later.

FAY

Henry...

HENRY

Gimme another one of those tall double

espressos, Mr Deng.

MR DENG

You gunna buy that?

HENRY

I'm just looking.

MR DENG

Well then put it back.

HENRY

There's this fascinating story about

a famous rock band and how they tied

a friend of theirs to a bed in their

hotel room and inserted a live fish

into her vagina.

HENRY

(explains)

They say she had numerous orgasms.

MR DENG

Henry, you need to do something with

your life. Get a job, or something.

HENRY

I mean, it wasn't the entire fish,

it was just, you know, the nose. The

nose of the fish.

HENRY

You don't find that interesting?

MR DENG

No.

HENRY

You ever wonder what it would be

like to have sex with an animal, Mr

Deng?

MR DENG

That coffee is free. Just take it

and get out of here.

HENRY

I mean, some dogs are almost as big

as people and often more attractive.

SIMON

Did you see him?

FAY

He came by this afternoon.

SIMON

Did you talk?

FAY

No.

SIMON

You've got to tell him, Fay.

FAY

He thinks I'm a slut.

SIMON

Henry?

HENRY

Simon, I don't feel so good.

SIMON

What's wrong?

HENRY

I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.

SIMON

How many of these did you have?

HENRY

Seven.

SIMON

Henry, we have to talk.

HENRY

Can I use your toilet?

SIMON

Fay's taking a shower.

HENRY

How much you think I can get for

this?

SIMON

(pauses)

Henry, Fay's pregnant.

SIMON

Fay's pregnant with your child.

FAY

Jesus, Henry!

FAY

Hey, Henry. You OK?

FAY

Oh. Oh, Henry.

FATHER HAWKES

I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my

wife.

HENRY

I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my

wife.

FATHER HAWKES

And do promise before God and these

witnesses...

HENRY

And do promise before God and these

witnesses...

FATHER HAWKES

To be your loving and faithful

husband.

HENRY

To be your loving and faithful

husband.

FATHER HAWKES

In plenty and in want.

HENRY

In plenty and in want.

FATHER HAWKES

In joy and in sorrow.

HENRY

In joy and in sorrow.

FATHER HAWKES

In sickness and in health.

HENRY

In sickness and in health.

FATHER HAWKES

For as long as we both shall live.

HENRY

For as long as we both shall live.

FATHER HAWKES

Bless, O Lord, this ring, that he

who gives it and she who wears it

may abide in your peace and continue

in your favor until their life's

end.

FATHER HAWKES

Whom God has joined, let no man

separate.

HENRY

Oh, shit.

FAY

Simon, do something.

AMY

Look.

SIMON

Where did you get this?

AMY

It's all over the Internet.

AMY

They're even talking about it on the

TV news.

FAY

Simon?

AMY

There's a guy from the radio station

over at World of Donuts and a story

in the newspaper about some kids

burning down a school near Boston!

REPORTER

(on TV)

It all started right here in Queens,

Jim, at World of Donuts about one

year ago today, when local garbage

man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper

and began to compose what many have

come to regard as vicious, antisocial

and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines

of unrhymed free meter verse which

would one day serve to spark the

flames of controversy across the

nation and -- indeed -- the world.

OWEN FEER

(on TV)

This is outrageous! Measures must be

taken. Have we debased our culture

to such an extent that a garbage man

with a head full of sick ideas is

legitimately referred to as a poet,

and where the filth he spews can be

accessed by any child old enough to

turn on a computer? Is this what we

have come to? Not the transmission

of our highest ideals, but a cynical,

atheistic delirium!

POET LAUREATE

(on TV)

Poetry of this kind, and this poem

in particular, is, I think, a worthy

form of desperation; a digression on

the extremes of human experience; of

solitude, of community. It is perhaps

alarming, even upsetting to some --

myself included -- but it must be

allowed to exist.

ANCHORMAN

(on TV)

Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope

issued a message of hope for believers

in their fight against what he termed

the godless and lost. He did not

mention Simon Grim by name, but

offered a prayer for the young whom

he described as sadly in need of

faith and not the illusion of

conviction offered by rock music,

drugs and contemporary poetry.

FAY

God, Simon, I mean, like, you're a

total fucking rock star.

ANGUS

I'm willing to negotiate, Simon.

SIMON

I know, it's just...

ANGUS

You've had other offers.

SIMON

Well, yes. But.

ANGUS

What?

SIMON

Why have you reconsidered?

ANGUS

Because I think your writing will be

tremendously successful.

SIMON

But you don't like it?

ANGUS

It's growing on me.

SIMON

What made you change your mind?

ANGUS

Other people's responses. I don't

live in a vacuum, you know. Two months

ago I didn't have the proof of your

poem's appeal. Now I do.

ANGUS

Consider my offer carefully. Get

some professional advice. I'll call

you tomorrow.

FATHER HAWKES

What were the terms?

SIMON

A hundred thousand in cash up front.

FATHER HAWKES

Royalties?

SIMON

A seventy/thirty split.

FATHER HAWKES

Well, that could be better. But it

is a hundred thousand dollars up

front. Guaranteed money. You could

use that.

SIMON

So it's a good deal?

FATHER HAWKES

Of course it's good.

SIMON

So I should take it?

FATHER HAWKES

No. Try to get him up to a hundred

and fifty thousand.

HENRY

I've let myself down, Simon! I've

let myself be caught in the bloody

maw of banal necessity! How did I

get here? How did this happen to me?

I'm going to be somebody's father! I

need time to think. To write. Time

to finish my 'Confession'! I can't

work for a living! It's impossible!

I tried once. My genius will be wasted

trying to make ends meet!

HENRY

This is how great men topple, Simon.

Their hearts are in the right place

too much of the time! They get

sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How

could I have been so careless!

SIMON

Henry, please, let me read the

'Confession'.

HENRY

No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all

washed up. I'm finished!

SIMON

Angus James is convinced my poem is

going to make him incredibly wealthy.

He'll read your book and seriously

consider publishing it. If I ask him

to. I'm certain.

HENRY

Really? You really think so?

SIMON

I'll insist he publish the

'Confession'.

SIMON

(adds)

Or I won't let him publish my poem.

HENRY

You'd do that? You'd do that for me?

SIMON

You saved my life.

HENRY

Do you realize what you're saying?

SIMON

(pausing)

I owe you everything.

HENRY

OK.

FAY

It's really that bad?

SIMON

It's terrible.

ANGUS

You've read this?

SIMON

Yes.

ANGUS

And you want me to consider publishing

it?

SIMON

Yes.

ANGUS

As part of our deal?

SIMON

Yes.

ANGUS

Simon, this book, it's... It's really

quite bad.

SIMON

That's what you said about my poem.

ANGUS

I'm offering you a very real

expression of my faith in your

writing. Two hundred thousand dollars

and a sixty/forty split.

SIMON

But just exactly what is the nature

of your faith in my writing?

ANGUS

Look, Simon, you don't require my

admiration. You require my experience

as a publisher. And that experience

leads me to believe your poem will

make more money than any book of

poetry ever published. In history.

Virtually make you a household name

within two years. You'll never have

to work on a garbage truck again, I

assure you. Or do anything else for

that matter. Whereas this 'Confession'

by Henry Fool...

ANGUS

The most I can say for this is...

The man is a scoundrel.

SIMON

He taught me everything I know.

ANGUS

No! He encouraged all that was

expressive in you to become manifest.

He inspired you to act. He influenced

your perception.

SIMON

How about if my advance is only a

hundred thousand?

ANGUS

It's not about money, Simon.

SIMON

We could split the royalties

seventy/thirty.

ANGUS

I will not publish Henry Fool's

'Confession'.

ANGUS

Will you sign the contract?

HENRY

Simon? You're here.

SIMON

What happened?

HENRY

(coughs)

It's a boy.

SIMON

And Fay?

HENRY

She's alright.

HENRY

Thanks.

HENRY

How did it go?

SIMON

Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't

like your 'Confession'.

HENRY

Ah. I see. Well, what now?

SIMON

What do you mean?

HENRY

Did he suggest changes?

SIMON

No. He didn't.

HENRY

I mean, after all, there are things

I can do to make it more accessible.

SIMON

Accessible?

HENRY

I can soften up some of the language

and make it read easier. Take out

some of the more intratextual

references and popularize the

underlying Sturm und Drang, so to

speak. I can change its mode. Make

it more of a conventional novel

instead.

SIMON

No. Don't.

HENRY

(laughing)

Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist! I

appreciate your protectiveness, but

the integrity of the work gives it a

durability that can sustain such

things.

SIMON

No. Really, Henry. Don't.

HENRY

What are you saying; that it doesn't

merit revision?

SIMON

I'm saying... Angus James didn't

like it.

HENRY

Well, did you tell him what you think?

SIMON

What I think doesn't matter.

HENRY

Yes, it does. You've got to use your

influence with him.

SIMON

I gave it to him to read and he hated

it. What more can I do?

HENRY

You can refuse to let him publish

your poem.

SIMON

I can't do that.

HENRY

You said you would.

SIMON

That was before I read your book.

HENRY

(hit hard)

Oh.

SIMON

(looking up at him)

I signed the contract, Henry.

SIMON

Look, Henry, what did you expect?

HENRY

I... I don't know. Honesty, perhaps.

SIMON

(indignantly)

Look, if I had told you, when at

first I read it, that I thought it

was no good, what would you have

done?

HENRY

I would have respected your opinion.

SIMON

And insisted that there's no

accounting for taste.

HENRY

Well, is there?

SIMON

I don't know. I didn't bring it to

Angus because I thought it was good.

I brought it to Angus because you're

my friend.

HENRY

(staggered)

Oh how perfectly enormous of you,

Simon.

SIMON

(explodes)

Look, Henry, I did it! I wrote. I

wrote poetry because you told me to!

I worked! I worked while you sat

back and comfortably dismissed the

outside world as too shallow, stupid

and mean to appreciate your ideas.

HENRY

Is that such a priority? Is that

some sort of measure of a man's worth?

To drag what's best in him out into

the street so every average slob

with some pretense to taste can poke

it with a stick?

SIMON

(sits, tired)

Maybe. Maybe it is.

HENRY

You must be pretty impressed with

yourself, huh? The all too obviously

talented new man, the important new

voice, the early clue to a new

direction, or whatever, etc., etc.,

etc! A popular new trend conveniently

packaged for the distracted young

herd! You want to be liked more than

you know, Simon Grim! You'd be nowhere

without me and you know it.

SIMON

I'm leaving.

HENRY

Yes. It's time you left.

HENRY

I saw you for what you were in the

beginning, Simon. I hold no grudge

and I'm certain you will, in time,

leave some serious and small dent in

this world.

SIMON

(weakly)

The world is full of shit.

HENRY

The world is full of shit. It's true.

And you have to walk through it.

That's your part. I'm sorry. But

you're no good at it. Perhaps I'm

not. Perhaps I wasn't made to walk

through shit. Go on now. Leave. Do

what you're good at. Go.

FADE TO BLACK

FAY

Play!

PATTY

Henry, what did I tell you about

bringing the kid in here!

HENRY

Say hello to Patty, Ned.

NED

Hi.

PATTY

How you doin', sweetie? You wanna

Coke?

HENRY

So what did you learn at school today,

Ned? Anything?

HENRY

Here, I'll teach you something.

HENRY

Horrible, isn't it?

NED

It burns.

HENRY

See. That'll teach ya. Here, sip

this.

FAY

Ned!

FAY

Ned!

WARREN

(pointing at her)

I'm warning you, Pearl!

HENRY

That's it. That's it. Perfect!

BILL

Hey, Fool, it's about your friend --

what's his name. Your brother-in-

law.

HENRY

What about him?

BILL

(reading)

The controversial and reclusive

American poet Simon Grim has been

awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The Swedish Academy, who will confer

the award late next week, praised Mr

Grim for works of great and difficult

striving, for the rendering of the

desperate, the ugly and the mundane

in a language packed with our shared

human frailties...

HENRY

God, they must be hard up for geniuses

to pin medals on because, listen, I

gotta tell you, when I first met

this guy he didn't even know what an

iambic pentameter was.

BILL

He's a fraud.

HENRY

Keep a lid on it, Bill, you're outta

your league.

BILL

Stir things up so as to stay in the

newspapers. That's his racket.

HENRY

He's a great American poet, you dumb

fuck!

BILL

Poet, my ass! I could puke all over

a piece a loose leaf and be more

profound than he is!

HENRY

Come over here and say that and I'll

cripple ya in three different ways,

you boozed-up Philistine!

FAY

Henry!

FAY

Listen, you degenerate, I've had

about enough of this!

(smells Ned's breath)

Ned, have you been drinking?

HENRY

(explains)

His throat hurt from smoking.

FAY

Henry, don't come home tonight! I'm

warning you! Don't come home at all!

Ever!

HENRY

Who's winning?

MR DENG

Nobody.

HENRY

What's going on in there?

MR DENG

We gotta have rock 'n' roll shows

these days, Henry. The poetry readings

just don't pay the bills no more.

HENRY

What did I tell you! It was just a

fad. I told you that! I told everyone!

MR DENG

Did you hear about Simon? It was on

the news today.

HENRY

Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel

Prize. Anybody can get one of them

these days. That's the problem, with

this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got

any standards anymore. You seen Fay?

MR DENG

You better sleep in my office tonight,

Henry. She was very angry. You've

gotta let her cool off.

HENRY

I can't sleep in there with that

racket!

MR DENG

Suit yourself.

HENRY

What are you doing here, Pearl?

PEARL

You want some?

HENRY

(pauses)

Some what?

HENRY

Shit!

PEARL

Come sit here.

PEARL

That's what my dad always says.

HENRY

What?

PEARL

(dead)

'You want some?'

PEARL

People say you were once in jail for

having sex with a girl my age.

HENRY

That was a long time ago.

PEARL

You want some?

HENRY

You oughta get outta here, Pearl.

PEARL

I was here first.

HENRY

Go home.

PEARL

You go home.

HENRY

Fine.

PEARL

(scared)

Wait!

PEARL

(hanging her head)

I can't go home.

HENRY

(concerned)

Why not?

PEARL

He beat her up again.

HENRY

Warren beat up your mom?

HENRY

Is she alright?

PEARL

(sadly)

Do you think I'm pretty?

HENRY

Does she need help?

PEARL

I'll suck your cock if you kill him

for me.

HENRY

Vicky! Vicky, it's Henry from across

the street! Vicky!

HENRY

(taken back)

Vicky?

VICKY

(standing)

What do you think you're doing, you

idiot!

WARREN

(off)

Hey!

HENRY

(to Vicky)

It's about Pearl.

VICKY

Mind your own business, Henry.

WARREN

(shoves him)

Yeah, who the hell do you think you

are, anyway?

WARREN

Ah.

WARREN

Fuck.

LAWYER

(off)

It is true your husband served seven

years in prison for statutory rape.

FAY

Yes. It is.

LAWYER

And when was that?

FAY

That was... I dunno. Fifteen...

Sixteen years ago.

LAWYER

And when were you married?

FAY

We were married seven years ago.

LAWYER

Were you aware at all of the victim's

relationship with his daughter?

FAY

Pardon me?

LAWYER

The girl, the daughter, Pearl. She

had been having sexual relations

with her father.

FAY

I didn't know that. No.

LAWYER

Pearl claims she offered your husband

sexual favors if he would kill her

father.

LAWYER

I'm just repeating what she said,

Mrs Fool. The victim's wife, Vicky,

claims your husband broke into the

house and forcefully entered her

bedroom.

LAWYER

Fay, I know this isn't easy. But we

need your help here. The girl claims

she asked your husband to kill her

father in exchange for, well, I guess

the promise of sexual relations with

her.

NED

Mom?

FAY

Yeah.

NED

Where's Dad?

FAY

I don't know, honey. Leave me alone

a minute, I gotta think.

NED

Mom?

FAY

What!

NED

Is Dad in trouble?

FAY

Yes, Ned, he is. He's in big trouble.

Now just be quiet for two minutes.

NED

Mom?

FAY

I'm warning you, Ned.

NED

Mom, can I be a mailman when I grow

up?

FAY

Sure you can, honey. You can be

anything you want.

CONCIERGE

Yeah, what do you want?

NED

My uncle.

CONCIERGE

What's his name?

NED

Simon Grim.

CONCIERGE

There ain't no one here by that name.

NED

Room 423.

CONCIERGE

This is post marked five years ago.

CONCIERGE

What does he look like?

NED

(hopeless)

I don't know.

CONCIERGE

Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.

CONCIERGE

(jumping up)

Hey!

SIMON

Get up off your knees.

LAURA

Promise me you'll be on that plane

at seven, Simon.

SIMON

I'll see you in Stockholm.

HENRY

Look, Simon, the world's a scary

place. I admit it. But it's not my

fault. I swear!

SIMON

I'm sorry, Henry.

HENRY

Don't be. You had things to do.

SIMON

So did you.

HENRY

Gotta light?

HENRY

Take care of your mom and don't start

trouble you can't finish.

HENRY

I love you, Fay.

FAY

(rolls her eyes)

Yeah, well, tough.

AIRLINE TICKET CLERK

Passport and ticket, please.

AIRLINE TICKET CLERK

(recognizes)

It's an honor to meet you, Mr Grim.

Really. I mean, God. Congratulations

on the Nobel Prize.

HENRY

Thanks.

AIRLINE TICKET CLERK

I know all your work by heart. It

changed my life.

HENRY

Yeah, well. Look, thanks, but..

AIRLINE TICKET CLERK

Yes. Of course.

AIRLINE TICKET CLERK

You'll have to hurry, sir. They're

holding the plane for you on the

runway.

AIRLINE REP #1

This way, please, this way! This

way, Mr Grim! This way! Excuse me!

SIMON

(shoves him)

Go on.

AIRLINE REP

Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting!

We have to hurry!

AIRLINE REP

This way, Mr Grim! This way!

SIMON

(unheard)

Run.
