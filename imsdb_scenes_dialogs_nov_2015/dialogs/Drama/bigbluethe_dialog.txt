THE BOYS

Jacques!  Come quick!

BOYS

Look!  Right there!  It's shining!

JACQUES

(squinting)

A coin.

FIRST BOY

I found it.

SECOND BOY

Liar!

JACQUES

Ok.  I'll get it, but no fighting,

all right?

JACQUES

We'll split it.

FIRST BOY

You can't split a coin.  That's

stupid.

SECOND BOY

He's right.  You're stupid.

JACQUES

Then we'll buy something and split

that.

SECOND BOY

A helicopter...

JACQUES

It's a small coin.

FIRST BOY

A Ferrari.

SECOND BOY

I don't want a Ferrari... What is

it?

JACQUES

(interrupting them)

Maybe a little radio.

JACQUES

Well.  We'll decide later.  The light

is going.

SECOND BOY

I get the radio from after school,

until midnight.

FIRST BOY

Since when do you stay up until

midnight?

JACQUES

All right, all right... Can I

concentrate?  And you can stop

pointing.  I've seen it.

VOICE (O.S.)

I've seen it too.

FIRST BOY

(annoyed)

Shit, it's the Italian!

ENZO

Well, if it isn't the little

Frenchman!  How is the little

Frenchman?

JACQUES

(cool)

Fine!

ENZO

You don't mind if I go instead, do

you?

JACQUES

(intimidated, and

pretending not to

be)

No...

ENZO

If you did mind, you'd tell me,

wouldn't you?

ENZO

(to his brother)

Roberto, mio palmo!

ENZO

(to his brother on

the edge of the

pier)

Count!

ROBERTO

1... 2... 3...

ROBERTO

4... 5... 6...

ENZO

(showing him the

coin)

Who's is it now?  You saw it but I

dove for it!

ENZO

(without turning

around)

Roberto?  How long?

ROBERTO

Six seconds.

ENZO

I'll throw it back into the water.

You dive and if you do less than

six, it's yours.

ENZO

Brava!

BOY

(timidly)

Enzo?  I saw the coin first... We

split?

ENZO

(smiling)

You can't split a coin, stupid.

PRIEST

Jacques... Come, look.

PRIEST

Is it a coin shining down there?

JACQUES

(overjoyed)

It is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it

for you, Father!

PRIEST

It'll be for the poor.

JACQUES

Padre?

DISSOLVE TO:

FATHER

(with a smile)

... Come on, time to get up,

Jacques!

FATHER

(screaming at the

top of his lungs)

Louis, wake up!

FATHER

Jacques, come help me.

JACQUES

You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.

UNCLE LOUIS

Then you shouldn't eat everyday,

Jacques.

FATHER

(winks at him)

Don't worry.  When I'm tired down

there, the mermaids help me out.

UNCLE LOUIS

(to Jacques)

Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?

JACQUES

No.

UNCLE LOUIS

I've seen them.

UNCLE LOUIS

Don't you want to know where?

UNCLE LOUIS

Why don't you ask me?

JACQUES

What?

UNCLE LOUIS

Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why

don't you ever ask any question?

I'm always the one asking the

question!  We're sitting here like

two stones and I'm taking to myself.

Ask me something, Goddamnit!

JACQUES

(in a completely

flat tone)

Why did my mother leave?

UNCLE LOUIS

(ill at ease)

Come on now, pump!

UNCLE LOUIS

Your mother didn't leave.  She went

back to America, that's all.  It's

her home.  She's allergic to this

Island.  She likes refrigerators and

machines that clean the floor... so

one day she left.  Woman are like

that, unpredictable, like the sea.

JACQUES

(with a slight grin)

So where did you see mermaids?

UNCLE LOUIS

In the bars in Athens!

ENZO

(screaming)

Jacques!  Jacques!

DISSOLVE TO:

SUPERVISOR

(exhausted)

Signore Molinari?

ROBERTO

(shaking his hand)

Yes.

ENZO

(calmly undressing,

expressionless)

How did it happen?

SUPERVISOR

(upset)

The company asked me to extract

everything I could from the wreck;

so the divers were trying to get at

the engine... and then the boat

turned over... in the current...

and... look, I fucked up!  Can you

help?

ENZO

How many are, down there?

SUPERVISOR

Just one... We're feeding him air,

but he's not breathing regularly...

You've got to get him out fast.

ENZO

(a beat)

Ten thousand.

SUPERVISOR

Lira?

ENZO

Dollars.

SUPERVISOR

You're going to hold me up at a time

like this?

ROBERTO

You do understand you're talking to

the champion diver of the world?

SUPERVISOR

Yes, but ten thousand dollars...

ENZO

Okay.  You tell me.  How much would

you say the man's life is worth?

ENZO

In my village, we have a saying:

when the wind blows, the flags of

all nations flap in the same

direction.

SUPERVISOR

(baffled)

What does that mean?

ROBERTO

That you should get your checkbook.

Damn quick.

ROBERTO

Since we have a little time, what do

you say you write that check?

ROBERTO

(to the Supervisor)

Sign here.

SUPERVISOR

(through the open

roof smiling)

Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that

too... You extortionist bastard!

ENZO

Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for

ten thousand dollars!

ROBERTO

(after a while)

Enzo, what are you going to do with

the money?

ENZO

Have the car painted.

ROBERTO

Santini will do that for 25 dollars!

ENZO

Then tell him to wax it too.

ROBERTO

Enzo, really.  What are you going to

get?

ENZO

(thinking)

A rosary for Mama, a dress for

Angelica, something with rhine-

stones for what's her name, and get

yourself a suit that fits... But

most important...

ROBERTO

Yes?

ENZO

Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.

JOHANA

(in Spanish)

Is this the Lago del Demonio?

(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio)

... Huacracocha?

JOHANA

Gracias.

OLD MAN

You welcome.

FRANK

(smiling)

Welcome to Peru!

JOHANA

Don't you have a heater?

FRANK

(hitting at the

dashboard)

Yeah... Sure... Is this your first

trip to Peru?

JOHANA

Does anybody live to make a second?

JOHANA

(a little worried)

Forget about the heater!

FRANK

A drink to warm up?

JOHANA

Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if

possible.

FRANK

(pulling out a flask)

Tea... or whiskey?

JOHANA

... both.  Did I just see a man in a

red suit and goggles?

FRANK

... right.

(calling out)

Dr. Lawrence?  The insurance man...

uh... The insurance person is here!

LAWRENCE

It's about time!

JOHANA

Would it be out of place to ask what

he's doing?

FRANK

Who?

JOHANA

The guy in the Halloween suit!

LAWRENCE

Did you have a nice trip?  We were

getting restless, it's been three

weeks since the accident.

LAWRENCE

(to Johana)

You should get things moving, you

know.  We're out of equipment and we

can't do half of our experiments...!

Frank, check the program!

JOHANA

Who... Who is that?

LAWRENCE

Mayol... Jacques Mayol.

JOHANA

That's the experiment?  Dumping a

guy into a frozen lake?

LAWRENCE

... The truck fell into a very deep

crevasse.  We weren't able to save

the equipment.

JOHANA

I'll have to talk to the driver.

LAWRENCE

In the spring when he melts!

JOHANA

(dumbfounded)

You really send him under the ice?

He isn't a slave or a convict or

anything?

LAWRENCE

My dear, science is a cruel

mistress.

JOHANA

But... how is he going to breathe?

LAWRENCE

He isn't going to breathe.

LAWRENCE

Listen...

LAWRENCE

That's his heartbeat.

(excited)

Can you hear the speed at which it's

slowing down, it's incredible.

LAWRENCE

He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen

to his heart.  Impressive, huh?  The

flow of blood is concentrated in the

brain and doesn't even feed the

limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that

has only been observed with

dolphins... until now.

JOHANA

How long can he stay down?  Without

breathing?

LAWRENCE

It depends.  He should come up soon.

(smiling)

Unless he's decided to stay for the

night.

JOHANA

Why is he doing this?

LAWRENCE

For one thing, it's his job... as

for the rest of it, I wish I knew.

JOHANA

Shouldn't somebody take him a

blanket or something?

LAWRENCE

(smiling at Frank)

Coffee might be nice.

JOHANA

(afterthought)

Will he understand Spanish?

LAWRENCE

His mother's an American.  He spent

half of his life in the states.  I'd

try English if I were you.

JACQUES

(puzzled)

I recognize you.

JOHANA

We saw each other a little while

ago.

JACQUES

(serious)

In the lake?

JOHANA

(wondering whether he

is joking or not)

No... in the hut.

JACQUES

(with a beautiful

smile)

Then it was somebody that looked a

lot like you... Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

DRIVER

It's beautiful, isn't it?

DRIVER

We had some bad wind this week.  The

"Mistral"!!  "Peuchere"!  There

isn't one olive left on its tree.

It suddenly left us this morning...

I sure won't be the one to call it

back.

JACQUES

(to the driver)

I'll only be five minutes.

JACQUES

Good morning, everybody!  Did you

sleep well?  I slept in a plane, and

it wasn't too great.

JACQUES

(calling out)

Hey!  presents.

JACQUES

You think I'd forget you?

JACQUES

For Bathsheba.

JACQUES

It's a Llama.  You understand?  From

Peru.  It's fighting.

JACQUES

That's for you, Darjeeling.  We

wouldn't want you to catch cold!

JACQUES

And now...

(singing out)

"Ta, da..." For you Tina.

JACQUES

Something you've never seen either.

JACQUES

Snow!

JACQUES

(smiling like a

child)

A new experience, Tina.

(nostalgic)

I missed you little rascals.  Did

you get my post card?

JACQUES

(pretending to be

serious)

Oh?  Is that what you want?

Alright, but five minutes, no more.

I have a taxi waiting.

DISSOLVE TO:

SALLY (O.S.)

I changed the lock you son of a

bitch!

JOHANA

... Sally?

SALLY

You're back!  Hello.  We were

burgled.

JOHANA

Again?

SALLY

They got the new T.V.

SALLY

... And the new stereo.

JOHANA

I hope they remembered to take the

microwave this time?

SALLY

Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me

clean up, okay?

JOHANA

You called the police?

SALLY

They're going to send detectives.

When they get around to it.

JOHANA

(shrugging)

So what, all they ever want is your

phone number anyway.

SALLY

Well?

JOHANA

What?

SALLY

How was your trip?

JOHANA

(flatly)

Nice... Very interesting... Great!

(doubtfully)

... I guess.

SALLY

(ironically)

Okay... Who'd you meet?

SALLY

A cardiogram...?  You met a doctor!

Congratulations, you're in the

chips...

(an afterthought)

Unless they have socialized medicine

in Peru.  Do they?

JOHANA

(indicating paper)

It's his heartbeat.

SALLY

Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.

(starts toward

kitchen)

They left the stove.

TIME DISSOLVE:

JOHANA

(nonstop)

6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't

be sure, you know the flippers, they

add height or they take it away, or

something.  Anyway short dark hair...

Not punk or anything, just short.

And the cutest smile.  He wasn't

smiling at me, I don't think -- just

smiling.  And he thought he saw me in

the lake.  I mean that was a figure

of speech... They're so romantic,

the French.

SALLY

(bored, half asleep)

I thought you said he was Peruvian?

JOHANA

(annoyed)

Haven't you been listening?

SALLY

... Since eight o'clock last

night...!  You're in love.

JOHANA

Don't be a jerk.

(emphatically)

There's no such thing as love at

first sight.

DISSOLVE TO:

ENZO

Jacques, my friend, how are you?

JACQUES

(happy)

Enzo...

ENZO

I leave you swimming and twenty

years later, you're still in the

water!  What the hell are you doing?

Training?

JACQUES

Yes.

ENZO

That's good.

(smiling again)

You never would have recognized me,

huh?  Check out the suit!  Looking

good, no?  You know I'm the world

champion?

JACQUES

Yes, I know.

ENZO

I dove 315 feet!

JACQUES

Great!

ENZO

They say I'm like Lazarus.  You

know, the guy who was raised from

the dead?!

ENZO

(serious)

Doesn't it surprise you that I just

show up like this... Listen, the

world championship starts in ten

days in Taormina.  Be my guest.

ENZO

Your ticket.

JACQUES

Why?

ENZO

Because I'm sure you're dying to

beat me.

JACQUES

(shaking his head)

I don't want to be in any

competition... I dive because I like

to, not to beat a record... don't

you have to be very mad at somebody

to want to beat him?

ENZO

No.  All you need is to want to be

the best.

JACQUES

(smiles)

You're the best, Enzo!

ENZO

(with a tense grin

on his face)

That's too easy!  Every time I beat

a record there's always some

dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know

that French guy, Mayol?  He's

supposed to be very good!  Too bad

he doesn't compete." So, you're

going to come with me to Taormina!

First, because you're my friend and

second, because you don't have one

reason to keep on spoiling my

pleasure.

(he pushes the

airplane ticket to

Jacques)

... I'll see you there...

DUFFY

(indicating report)

This is good work... unfortunately

it's incomplete.

(he glances at the

window)

Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors

above the street.

JOHANA

(absently)

What kind?

DUFFY

Johana, am I boring you?

JOHANA

Sorry.  Of course not, definitely

not... well, maybe a little.  What

did you say?

DUFFY

I said that the file is incomplete.

See if you can get through to this

Lawrence character and have him send

the Peruvian registration for his

missing truck... and don't let him

tell you it was in the glove

compartment.

JOHANA

Right Chief!

DUFFY

(to her back)

Did the driver really freeze?

JOHANA

Like a popsicle.  They're keeping

him on a stick until spring.

DUFFY

My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.

JOHANA

(under her breath,

leaving)

... So am I.

LAWRENCE

(screaming)

... I said, all the truck papers are

in the glove compartment!

JOHANA

(with a sigh)

Okay, listen, just get the custom's

office to send me a copy as fast as

possible.  We can't send you new

equipment until our file is

complete.  Okay?

LAWRENCE

Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the

end of the week, how's that?

JOHANA (V.O.)

You've made me a happy insurance

person.

LAWRENCE

Then, goodbye.

JOHANA

Wait!  Professor...?

LAWRENCE (V.O.)

... Yes?

JOHANA

(as softly as

possible)

You don't know how I could reach

that diver of yours... Mayol... We

need some additional information...

I mean, we have a few questions to

ask him.

LAWRENCE

The last thing I heard, he was off

to Taormina for the world diving

championships.  That's Taormina, in

Sicily!

JOHANA

Listen, I just found out we've got

real problems in Sicily!

DUFFY

(alarmed)

What d'you mean?

JOHANA

(improvising)

The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!

Coppola!  De Niro...!  I knew it!  I

knew we shouldn't have written that

policy!!

DUFFY

(pale)

What's happened??

JOHANA

The documents are forged.

DUFFY

No!

JOHANA

Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has

the same signature as the

contractor!

DUFFY

(outraged)

It can't be true!

JOHANA

(fast talking)

We have to send somebody over there

immediately!  If we prove the

forgery we can cancel the policy.

We'll be off the hook.  There's a

flight to Rome in two hours and from

there its just a short hop to

Sicily.

DUFFY

(reaching for phone)

I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able

to...

JOHANA

(interrupting)

I tried him, he can't go.  His son

is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow...

I'll go, boss.

DUFFY

I thought it was Spanish that you

spoke?

JOHANA

(after a beat)

Italian is practically the same

thing.

DRIVER

... Taxi?

RECEPTIONIST

(checking the books)

Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.

JACQUES

(uncomfortable)

... Are you sure?

RECEPTIONIST

Positive, Sir.

JACQUES

This is the hotel San Domenico?

RECEPTIONIST

Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127

years.

JACQUES

(more and more

uncomfortable)

Yes, but... So, you haven't got a

room left?

RECEPTIONIST

No Sir, the hotel is full because of

the Diving championship.

JACQUES

Ah?!

ENZO

(to doorman)

Be careful with that car, it's a new

paint job.

ENZO

(yelling across the

lobby)

Giacomino!  My friend!  My brother!

ENZO

(looking at him)

So you finally decided to join us?

You did the right thing!

ENZO

(to the desk clerk)

Hey Paolo!  Come stai?  Get my key!

(to Jacques,

gesturing over his

shoulder)

You remember my little brother

Roberto?

JACQUES

I remember.  Hi Roberto!

ENZO

What room have you got?

JACQUES

I don't have one.

ENZO

You don't have a room?

(at the top of his

lungs)

Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I

personally called you to reserve a

room for my good friend Jacques

Mayol and you treat him like a

stranger?!

JACQUES

(embarrassed)

It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere

else.

ENZO

Not only is Jacques Mayol a very

special friend, but he happens to be

one of the best divers in the world!

And you're throwing him out!  Are

you crazy, or what?  Stupido!

JACQUES

(really embarrassed

now)

Enzo drop it, I'll find something.

ENZO

Take mine.  I'll take the Countess'

suite.  She told me she was leaving

for the cemetery... She'll be more

comfortable there.

ENZO

(sincerely)

I'm glad you're here.

ENZO

(to waiter)

"Spaghetti del mare"

(to Jacques)

It's delicious here.  It's the one

thing they really know how to make.

WAITER

Del mare for two?

JACQUES

(nodding quickly)

Yes, sure, for two.

ENZO

And a bottle of "Frascatti".  Two

bottles!

WAITER

Si Signore, grazie mille.

ENZO

He moves just like a woman.

(then, as if he were

speaking to Jacques)

It must be hard to live in two

worlds like that, huh?  To breathe

in one, swim in the other...

ENZO

(suddenly louder)

Anyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad!

Huh, Jacques!

TIME DISSOLVE TO:

ENZO

... So, after all these years, you

must have lots of questions to ask.

Am I right?

JACQUES

(quickly)

Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

ENZO

Well, what are they?

JACQUES

(giving up)

I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask

the questions.

ENZO

Well, then.  I'll do the asking for

you.  "Tell me dear Enzo, how did

you become World Champion?"  Oh,

that's a long story.

(his voice changes)

Well, after you left Amorgos, I went

back to Italy and joined the Navy.

So you now have in front of you --

Captain Molinari, who's been on

leave of absence for the past 14

years...

JACQUES

That's good.

ENZO

How do you make a living?  Your

experiments, does it pay well?

JACQUES

It's okay.

ENZO

... You married?

JACQUES

No.

ENZO

Me neither, 'cause of my Mother.

She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado.

Stubborn as a mule!  I was

engaged... for a week.  After that,

Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta

was bouncing off the walls.

ENZO

So, not married.  Well, good for

you.  You play the field, like me.

A girl in every port, huh?

JACQUES

(bluffing)

Exactly, I mean, after all, we're

men!

ENZO

(slapping the table

top)

Damn right!  That's what I tell them

when people say you've turned into a

fish.

JACQUES

(concerned)

People say that?

ENZO

(sorry he went too

far)

Forget it.  I was joking.

ENZO

Eh!  La Madonna!  This one is for

me.  I'll bet you my watch that

she's in my bed tonight.

ENZO

(quickly)

I tell you she's mine!

JOHANA

(to Jacques)

Hello!

ENZO

(surprised)

You know each other?

JOHANA

Yes.

ENZO

Enzo Molinari.

ENZO

This is a great pleasure.

JOHANA

(laughing at the

protocol)

Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.

(then to Jacques,

faking surprise)

Well!  Isn't this a coincidence.  I

really wasn't expecting this... All

the way out here.  It's incredible!

JACQUES

Please, have a seat.

JOHANA

Thank you.  I wouldn't want to

interrupt anything.

JACQUES

No, no!

ENZO

Not at all!

JACQUES

You're staying at the hotel?

JOHANA

I wish, but it's full.  They

recommended a pension in town.  They

say that all of Taormina is full.

What's going on here?

ENZO

It's the Free Diving World

Championship.  I am by the way world

champion!

JACQUES

But what brought you to Sicily?

JOHANA

I was doing an insurance

investigation in Palermo.

(to Enzo)

I work for an insurance company.

(back to Jacques)

So, I decided to take a few days

off.

(uncomfortable)

I don't know this island at all.  It

really is gorgeous.

ENZO

There is no place in the world more

beautiful than Sicily!

ENZO

(to waiter)

A spaghetti del mare for the super

dedicated traveling insurance

agent.

JOHANA

(smiling)

I think I'll have a coffee.

JACQUES

No, no.  You'll like it.  It's

superb.

JOHANA

... Okay.  I'll try.

ENZO

(impatient)

Where did you two meet?

JOHANA

In a lake.

ENZO

I might have known.

(to Johana)

As I was telling you earlier, I'm

the world champion free diver.

JOHANA

Congratulations.

ENZO

Some people say it's the most virile

sport in the world.  One has to

admit that when you see those men

diving head first in that deep blue

sea, all muscles contracted in one

super human effort...

JACQUES

(interrupting)

Enzo?

ENZO

(annoyed)

What?

JACQUES

Your mother?

ENZO

Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia!

Where...?  God, she'll kill me...

(pushing the plate

in front of Johana)

... if she catches me eating pasta

in a restaurant.

ENZO

... Mamma!

MAMMA MOLINARI

(expressionless)

You expect me to carry all the

luggage myself?

ENZO

Mamma.  Roberto and an elevator...

Isn't that enough?

MAMMA MOLINARI

(suspiciously)

What have you been eating?

ENZO

Coffee only, I'm diving tomorrow.

You remember little Jacques, Jacques

Mayol...

JACQUES

(timidly)

Madame...

ENZO

... And his friend, Johana...

WAITER

(arriving proudly)

Spaghetti del mare!

JOHANA

(to waiter)

Thank you.

MAMMA MOLINARI

Americana?

MAMMA MOLINARI

(impressed, to

Johana)

Benvenuto!

JOHANA

Thanks for helping with the bag.

(she looks up at the

pension with little

enthusiasm)

It looks great!

JACQUES

I thought it was a nice place.

(suddenly doubting)

Isn't it?

JOHANA

I'm being a pain in the ass.

(looking at him)

It's beautiful here.

JOHANA

You're going to be very busy these

days aren't you?

JACQUES

I don't know... why?

JOHANA

Just because... I would have liked

to visit the town... See the

coast... I don't know anybody...

Expect for you.

(feeling she has

gone too far)

But you are going to be very busy.

You must have tons of things to

prepare, interviews... And a

competition like this one must

require a great deal of

concentration, right?

JACQUES

(shakes his head

negatively)

Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I

don't like competitions... It ruins

the fun.  Don't you think?

JOHANA

(with a faint smile)

I guess... But you know... I'm

American and I've mostly been taught

to be competitive... There's always

pleasure of being the best?

JACQUES

Maybe on earth there is one... but

not when you dive... You see, to

dive deep into the sea, for no

reason... just to do it.  It's a

feeling... I don't know how to say

this... Voluptuous?

JOHANA

(laughing)

You can put down the suitcases, you

know.

ENZO

C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have

to get ready for the ceremony

tonight.  We have a new world

champion.

JACQUES

I'm a little tired, I don't know

if...

ENZO

Get in the car!

ENZO

Roberto!  The bow-tie!

ENZO

(taking a few steps

back)

Very good.

ROBERTO

What about the shoes?

ENZO

Very chic.

(hesitates)

Anyway, you don't have anything

else, do you?

JACQUES

No.

ENZO

Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!

JOHANA

I thought you'd be at the dinner.

JACQUES

It's too loud for me.

JOHANA

You look adorable.

JACQUES

Thank you...

JOHANA

(smiling)

... Especially the sneakers.

NOVELLI

Ladies and Gentlemen, your

attention, please.  Mr. Andre

Bonnet, President of the

International Diving Championship

Committee, is going to present this

trophy to the new world champion of

free diving.  This afternoon, our

new champion descended to the

remarkable depth of 280 feet.

NOVELLI

This young man Tia...

NOVELLI

Tiraro... Tirao-re... Moa...

TAHITIAN

Tiraero Moameora.

NOVELLI

... Let's all give him a big hand.

ENZO

(very sarcastic)

A one day hero!

ENZO

A new world record!  That's great!

It gives me something to beat

tomorrow!

(to Johana)

You ever been to Tahiti?

JOHANA

No.

ENZO

I'll take you there.  We'll live in

the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and

we'll make love under the coconut

trees.

JOHANA

You forgot the Hula!

ENZO

Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!

JOHANA

You'll be lovely, but no thanks.

(to Jacques)

Jacques, would you do a native dance

for me?

JACQUES

I don't know how... Excuse me.

ENZO

He looks strange, doesn't he?  Like

a baby that just learned to walk.

JOHANA

Have you known him long?

ENZO

Forever.  We used to live on the

same island in Greece, when we were

kids.

JOHANA

What was he like, when he was little?

ENZO

Little.  Very little.  And skinny,

very skinny too.  That is compared

to me.

JOHANA

(amused)

I get it, Enzo you were a superior

child.

ENZO

Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're

so crazy about him, you don't see

the truth?!

ENZO

Forget it, don't think of Jacques as

a human being.  He's from another

world.

JOHANA

And just where are you from?

ENZO

Italy!

ENZO

There is nothing like music.  It

speaks from the heart.  Can you tell

me why we bother diving in the dark,

the cold, without ever taking the

time to breathe?  Huh?  Can you tell

me why we do it?

ENZO

Why?

JACQUES

... For the mermaids.

ENZO

My father used to see them

everywhere too... but the only one

he ever caught was my mother...

Actually she caught him.

JACQUES

Today at lunch, you asked me if I

had any questions.

ENZO

Ah ha.  You finally want to know

about women.

JACQUES

Why?  Are they what's most

important?

ENZO

No... It depends... Sometimes they

are... What, exactly do you want to

know?

JACQUES

... Everything.

ENZO

Everything about what?

JACQUES

(thinking)

Well... about everything.

TIME DISSOLVE TO LATER:

ENZO

... So, between Mamma, Roberto and

the sisters, we yell and scream all

day long.  Except with Angelica.

She just cries.  And then finally,

we all end up kissing.  Can you

explain that to me?

ENZO

Because that's what love is all

about.  It's a pain in the ass but

keeps us together.

(then, in a half

dreaming, half

desperate tone)

A large and beautiful family!

JACQUES

(suddenly)

Enzo... We must quit the

competition.

ENZO

(worried)

Why?

JACQUES

If we don't... I'm going to beat

you.

ENZO

(with a nervous

laugh)

Huh?  Well listen to him!

(to Johana)

Do you hear that?

JOHANA

No.

ENZO

He looks me in the eye like some

fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm

going to beat you".

JOHANA

(with a smile)

... That's what he's here for, isn't

he?

ENZO

Listen to her!  "That's what he's

here for"!  He's here to loose,

that's what he's here for.  First of

all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how

old are you?

JACQUES

Two years younger than you.

ENZO

As I said, second of all you're too

skinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I

still don't understand how you can

dive without getting sick.

JACQUES

The size of the lungs has nothing to

do with it!

ENZO

Look at me.  These aren't lungs.

These are... Tanks.  How long can

you hold your breath?

JACQUES

(impatiently)

I don't know.  Longer than you.

ENZO

We'll see.

JOHANA

Take it easy...

PARAMEDIC

Don't worry, he's empty now.  He

needs sleep, that's all.

JACQUES

Who won?

JOHANA

Won what?  The Ass Hole Award?

Well, let me tell you, it's a tie!

JOHANA

Acting like a pair of two year olds!

You could have died in that damn

pool!

JACQUES

Please move slowly, you're rocking

the boat.

JOHANA

(smiling)

Lucky I was there to save you.

JACQUES

(seeing her wet

dress)

You jumped in?

JOHANA

Only to help the medics, I assure

you.

JACQUES

My wallet.

JOHANA

It's still here.

JACQUES

No.  I want to show you.  Is it

ruined?

JOHANA

Well, water isn't exactly the best

thing for pictures... Not even for

pictures of dolphins...

JACQUES

Give it to me.

JACQUES

(on the verge of

tears)

My real family...

(he looks at the

picture and cries)

What kind of man has such a family?

JACQUES

I'm sick of never feeling at home

anywhere.

ROBERTO

Enzo, wake up!

ENZO

(pulled from his

dream)

Eh?  Si!  Avanti!

ROBERTO

The medics are looking all over for

you.

ENZO

(irritated)

I'm meditating, can't you see?

Jacques does two hours of yoga

before going down.  I can take a

five minute nap, can't I?

DOCTOR

Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but

I cannot allow you to dive in such

an advanced state of exhaustion.

ENZO

(outraged)

What do you know about the sea?

Huh?  Nothing!  So you just put your

tubes and tin cans away.  The sea is

mine!  I know when she is ready for

me and when she isn't.  And today,

she is ready.  Understand?

DOCTOR

You dive at your own risk.  You're

been warned.

ENZO

Brave.

JOHANA

You scared me!

JOHANA

Just checking up on your family.

(then embarrassed)

I guess I was drunker than I thought

and the idea of going back to my

hotel in a wet dress... Well...

JACQUES

I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.

JOHANA

(getting up)

I'd better get back now.

JACQUES

You... You wouldn't want to spend

the day with me?

JACQUES

(self conscious)

... No?

JOHANA

No?  Huh?

(she says "No" as if

she had asked the

question)

Yes, of course!!

JACQUES

What's the matter?

TRAINER

I don't understand.  We've tried for

two days.  They won't eat.  They

won't perform.  It's since we got

the new one.

JACQUES

Is she the new one?

JOHANA

How can you tell it's a female?

JACQUES

... The way she moves.

TRAINER

Did you ever think of trying the

public pool?

JOHANA

He's a dolphin specialist.

TRAINER

In that case what's wrong with the

new one?  Is she sick or not.

JACQUES

(taking his time to

answer)

Not the way you mean.

TRAINER

What am I supposed to do?  Do I call

the dealer...?  The investment, you

understand... I certainly am

entitled to complain!

JACQUES

It's going to cost you more than you

think!

JACQUES

She's not like the others.  She

can't stand to be away from the sea.

JOHANA

(impressed)

How do you know that?

JACQUES

(stopping)

I don't know, I just feel it.

ENZO

(screaming)

Ah!  Jacques!

ENZO

Don't be sad, I only took back what

was mine.

ENZO

Here, it's a present.

JACQUES

(touched)

... Thank you.

ENZO

(to Johana)

Tonight we're having a little party

among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my

suite?

JOHANA

Okay.

ENZO

Tell me... Can you explain why you

are soaking wet?

JOHANA

... We're in training.

NOVELLI

(through the door)

Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be

reasonable.  Everyone is waiting for

him upstairs.  The photographers are

there, the press...

ROBERTO (O.S.)

He can't, he's indisposed.

NOVELLI

(trying to keep his

calm)

Shall we call a doctor?

ROBERTO

No, it's okay.  Mamma is going to

try something.

NOVELLI

Mr. Mayol, help us.  He refuses to

receive his medal and everybody is

waiting for him up there.  We

already have problems with the press

because of the danger, and if we

don't even have the divers help...!

JACQUES

(dubious)

... I'll do my best.

NOVELLI

That's very kind of you.

JACQUES

It's Jacques... Mayol!

ENZO

Jacques!  My friend!  Come on in!

NOVELLI

Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to

impress upon you the importance of

your attending the Award Ceremony...

For the press...

ENZO

(loosing his temper)

I think my brother told you I was

indisposed, that should do it, no?

I'm allowed to be indisposed, right?

So, you just tell the press that the

"big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by

his inspiring descent to 324 feet,

will not be able to receive this

trinket because he is...

ENZO

Because he is?!

ONE OF THE THREE MEN

... Indisposed.

ENZO

(smiling)

Brave!

JACQUES

Tell me, why don't you go and get

your medal?

ENZO

Because pasta should be eaten "Al

Dente".  So the trinket will just

have to wait a bit.

ENZO

(to Mamma)

Mamma!  La pasta?!

MAMMA MOLINARI

Arrivo!  Arrivo!

ENZO

... It's easy.  You go down.  You

come up.

(to Johana)

... Right, Johana?

JOHANA

(smiling)

Congratulations, Enzo.

ENZO

Don't you agree, Jacques?

JACQUES

... You always were the best.

ENZO

Ah!  La pasta!

MAMMA MOLINARI

(with a smile)

Buon appetito, Signorina!

ENZO

(smiling)

What's the matter?  You still have a

bunch of things to ask me?  You want

to know the price of tea in China of

how we landed on the moon?  Is that

it?

JACQUES

No, I have to ask you a favor...

(a beat)

You're the only one who'll

understand.

ENZO

(seriously)

... I'm listening.

MAMMA MOLINARI

Tutto va bene?

NOVELLI

(mouth full)

Gracie mille, chignora.

ENZO

(leaning forward)

Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did

you learn how to drive?

JACQUES

Driving isn't the problem, it's

remembering the right road.

ENZO

And the lights!  Running lights,

stealing stretchers...!  You'll have

us in jail.

JOHANA

Enzo, stop bitching, will you?

JACQUES

(moved)

You can't stay here!  Come on!  Go

away!

ENZO

You can stop that now, she has all

the water she needs.

ENZO

All right, we did it.  Let's go back

to the party.

JACQUES

Just one minute.

ENZO

Jacques, the dolphin is home now.

And that's where we're going.  Come

on!  Hurry up now.  Our girlfriend

is freezing over there.

JOHANA

Well, good night, then...

ENZO

You going to sleep here, all by

yourself?

JOHANA

Yes...

JOHANA

... It's a comfortable place.

ENZO

Sinister is what I'd call it...!

Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't

you come and stay with me... There's

plenty of room in my suite.

JOHANA

(smiles)

The Mamma's there too.

ENZO

(face clouds up)

Yes, the Mamma is is there.

JOHANA

Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.

JACQUES

Good night.

ENZO

(to Jacques)

You don't need a stretcher to take

her with you.  You know that, don't

you?

JACQUES

What?

ENZO

The dolphins aren't the only ones

who don't feel very good sometimes.

JOHANA

Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay.

JOHANA

Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

JACQUES

(lost)

Uh... Yes, of course!

ENZO

You really do have a few things to

learn about women!

JOHANA

What are they for?

NOVELLI

They're paramedics.  They wait at

180 feet.

JOHANA

(just checking)

If there was a problem, they could

do something right?

NOVELLI

Of course, that's what they're for.

JOHANA

(pointing)

... And those?

NOVELLI

Those are the divers who go down 300

to 330 feet.  They dive with a

Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that

depth, compressed air is too

dangerous because it contains carbon

dioxide.

JOHANA

What's that little air bottle on the

machine?

NOVELLI

That isn't for the divers actually.

It's for the balloon.  It blows up

and pulls the diver up like an

elevator.  Without it, with the

pressure at the bottom, the diver

would just stay pinned to the sea

bed.

JOHANA

(shocked)

But doesn't Jacques dive without

anything?

NOVELLI

(smiling)

Yes... It's magic.

TECHNICIAN

Tre minuti!

TECHNICIAN

Due minuti!

TECHNICIAN

Uno minuto!

JOHANA

(excited)

Jacques, listen to the applause.

JOHANA

(trying to keep up)

Jacques, you set a world record.

JACQUES

I did?

JOHANA

Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel

proud...?  I feel proud and all I

did was watch.

ENZO

Congratulations Jacques!  It's

wonderful!  Wonderful!

ENZO

I'm happy for you!

ENZO

(to Jacques)

Here...

(to Johana)

Here...

JACQUES

What is it?

ENZO

Little presents, nothing much... I

knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!

ENZO

Roberto's watch!  I won it!  He bet

that you couldn't beat me!

ENZO

You still collect them?

JACQUES

Yes.

ENZO

You don't have that one, do you?

JACQUES

No.  Thank you.  It's really

beautiful.

ENZO

Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told

Roberto "He's very good that little

Frenchman, very good".  I lost my

title but I won a watch!

JOHANA

Is it a poem?

ENZO

No, it's the recipe for spaghetti

"Frutti del mare".

(to Jacques)

You see I was right in getting you

out here.  You're a world champion,

my friend!

ENZO

It's a measuring tape.

ENZO

You see this is your record, three

feet more than mine!  Looking at it

from here, it doesn't look like

much, does it?

ENZO

Keep your little measuring tape, my

friend, it will be a nice souvenir

when I beat you next.

JOHANA

Jacques?

JACQUES

(warm)

What are you doing here?

JOHANA

I'm going to leave, Jacques.

JOHANA

I'm going back home.

JACQUES

Why?

JOHANA

Because one shouldn't fall in love

with creatures from the sea.

JACQUES

I'm not from the sea... I don't

understand what you're talking

about.

JOHANA

Yes you do.  You know exactly what

I'm talking about.  You're afraid I

want to hold onto you, and I do,

but you're not ready... at least not

for me.

JACQUES

But it's not true, I feel good with

you... It feels right...

JOHANA

I've got to get back to the hotel...

and get my suitcase packed.

JACQUES

Will... will we see each other

again?

JOHANA

Take good care of yourself, Jacques.

JACQUES

Where can I call you?  Johana, tell

me where can I call you?

JACQUES

Can I come in?

ENZO

No problem, I enjoy talking in my

sleep.

ENZO

Wake me up at 11:00.

ENZO

(opening one eye)

Hmmm!  Something wrong?

ENZO

Is it the girl?

ENZO

Did she leave?

ENZO

Hey!  I'm going to take care of you!

I've got this job, on an oil rig, no

sweat!  I'm taking you along... Come

on!  Get your bags packed!  You're

coming with me, I tell you!

ENZO

We'll make a great team, the two of

us.  You'll see!

SUPERINTENDENT

Mayol, Molinari...?

SUPERINTENDENT

We've been waiting for you for three

days.  Goddamnit!

ENZO

Is that the way you talk to the best

diver in the world...?  And to his

friend Jacques Mayol!

SUPERINTENDENT

Show them their quarters.

JACQUES

(whispering)

He doesn't like us.

ENZO

So what!?  His job is to hand out

the paychecks.  And he does that

very well, let me tell you.

ENZO

(suddenly)

You still thinking about her?

ENZO

Don't think about her anymore!  Let

me tell you, you're just making

yourself unhappy!  There are so many

women in the world!

ENZO

Plenty of women everywhere right?

NOIREUTER

(coldly)

Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

ENZO

It isn't lit yet.

NOIREUTER

You shouldn't even carry cigarettes

on board!

ENZO

Listen we're not supposed to piss

either but that doesn't stop you

from carrying "it" on board?!

NOIREUTER

(stubborn)

The rules are the rules.

ENZO

(checking out this

creature)

... What's your name again?

NOIREUTER

Noireuter.

ENZO

And where did you say you were from?

NOIREUTER

I didn't say...

(contemptuous)

Brussels!

TECHNICIAN

They're at 450 feet.

ENZO

... I was seventeen, I loved her so

much I tried to die for her.  Two

years later I couldn't even remember

her name!  Let me tell you, time

erases everything!

JACQUES

I don't want to erase anything.

ENZO

You'd rather think about it and make

yourself miserable?

JACQUES

(after thinking about

it)

... Yes.

ENZO

(smiles)

I give you this.  You're stubborn...

Dumb, but stubborn.

JACQUES

(taking it as a

compliment)

Thank you.

TECHNICIAN

Minus 800 feet.  End of descent.

NOIREUTER

(with a Mickey Mouse

voice)

You have enough air for 15 minutes.

ENZO

(with Donald Ducks

voice)

What's with the voice?

NOIREUTER

It's nothing.  It's just the helium,

because of the air pressure.

ENZO

(worried)

And... does the voice come back?

NOIREUTER

For others, yes... For you, who

knows?

ENZO

(still a little

worried, to Jacques)

Try speaking to me?

JACQUES

(with Daffy Ducks

voice)

I don't find this funny.  We were

having a serious conversation.

ENZO

(to Jacques)

Here, give me your finger.

NOIREUTER

(in a panic)

Is that alcohol?  Are you out of

your mind?  Alcohol is strictly

forbidden.

ENZO

(loosing his temper)

Hey!  D'you have any other

complaints?  Just make a list and

we'll stick it on the porthole!

Okay?

ENZO

Go on, suck your finger.

NOIREUTER

Are you crazy?  At this pressure?

JACQUES

It's very deep down here.

ENZO

Come on, suck your finger, you'll be

seeing mermaids everywhere!

ENZO

(to Jacques)

A thousand commanders and we get a

Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.

SUPERINTENDENT

Can you hear me?  What's going on?

(to the technician)

Are you sure you're on the right

channel?

SUPERINTENDENT

If those guys are playing a radio

down there they'd just better watch

out!!

SALLY

... And if we repaint the walls,

we'll need new curtains, you put the

painters on you Visa and I'll do the

curtains on American Express... for

the couch there's Bloomingdales...

or are you still over your limit?

JOHANA

(flatly)

Way past it.

SALLY

Does that have a hidden meaning?

JOHANA

No.  I'm just depressed.

SALLY

You look it too.  You haven't been

working out, you haven't been taking

your vitamins!  You haven't been

drinking your herbs, you haven't

been...

JOHANA

(stopping her)

I know, I know!  I'm a terrible

person...

(after a beat)

It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.

SALLY

What is it honey... the frenchy?

JOHANA

(tentatively)

Do you think I should have stayed?

Don't you think maybe I should have

stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?

(then, emphatically)

I should have stayed!  I was

supposed to be in love... I was in

love!  I am in love, why did I act

like a bitch?  He went swimming.

All the man did was go swimming!  I

must be crazy.  It was too good to

be true.

SALLY

Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and

see a doctor, will ya?

DOCTOR

Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going

to do the trick this time.

JOHANA

(worried)

It's serious, right?

DOCTOR

I think so.  You're pregnant...

Congratulations!  If that's in

order?

JOHANA

It's in order!  Thank you.  Thank

you.

DOCTOR

I don't think it's me you have to

thank.

DUFFY

Good afternoon.

JOHANA

(agitated)

I came to make a clean breast of

everything... the whole business.

DUFFY

(bluffing, with his

mouth full of

sandwich)

Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.

JOHANA

(in a rush)

Remember when I went to Italy and

canceled the policy on the new

stadium.  Well, we weren't being

cheated by the Mafia or anybody

except maybe by me...

(she sees the window-

washers)

... Do they come for lunch everyday?

I really went on my own business, to

see a man that I happen to be in

love with... and I'm glad I did it,

but I'm sorry about the policy and

I'll be happy to make up the money

the company didn't get... of course

just now I don't have...

(she checks a note

she's holding)

One million, four hundred and ten

thousand dollars.  But if you were

to dock my salary, say, twenty

dollars a week, in a few hundred

years we'd be even... and I think

this is where you fire me?

DUFFY

(swallowing sandwich)

You're right.  You're fired.

JOHANA

Will that interfere with my getting

maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.

DUFFY

The Italian, I presume?

JOHANA

No.  He's French, he was just in

Italy for the competition.

DUFFY

(smiling)

He seems to have won it.

JOHANA

Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so

happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest

pregnant fired person in the world!

JOHANA

Bon appetit and Adieu!

JACQUES (V.O.)

Hello?

JOHANA

It's me... Johana.

JACQUES

How are you?

JOHANA

I got fired.

JACQUES (V.O.)

... That's funny... I had this job

with Enzo... we got fired too.

DISSOLVE TO:

JOHANA

(looking out at the

skyline)

It's getting light out.

JACQUES (V.O.)

Here, it's getting dark.

JACQUES

I've been thinking about you a lot,

you know...

JOHANA

So have I.

(a beat)

... Hello?

JACQUES

I'm still here.

JOHANA

Well, then, talk to me some more.

JACQUES

... It's hard you know.  You're so

far away and I don't know what else

to say.

JOHANA

Then, tell me a story.

JACQUES

Uh... Ah!  A story?

JACQUES

Do you know how it is?

(starting again)

Do you know what you're supposed to

do to meet a mermaid?

JOHANA

(with a smile)

No... tell me.

JACQUES

You go down to the bottom of the

sea, where the water isn't even blue

anymore, where the sky is only a

memory... and you float there,

quietly, quietly and stay there...

and you decide that you will die for

them... Only then do they start

coming out.  They come and greet you

and they judge the love you have for

them... If it's sincere.  If it's

pure... They will be with you and

take you away forever.

JACQUES

Hello?

JOHANA (V.O.)

It's me again.

JOHANA

(after a silence)

I'm being a pain, huh?

JACQUES

... Not at all.

JOHANA (V.O.)

You sure?

JACQUES

(smiling)

Absolutely positive.

JOHANA (V.O.)

Okay.  In that case... I'm at the

airport in Nice.

JACQUES

(lost)

Okay... huh, I'll be right over.

DRIVER

(loud)

The Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta.

JOHANA

(a little frightened)

Are you okay?

JACQUES

... I think I love you.

JOHANA

Why did you take me to the hotel, if

you live here.

JACQUES

You'll understand.

JOHANA

(surprised)

Someone in there?

JACQUES

Don't be afraid.  It's my Uncle...

Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS

Assassin!

JACQUES

(loud, as if speaking

to a deaf man)

Uncle Louis, this is my friend

Johana.

UNCLE LOUIS

Did you buy the cassettes?  The

Wagner, the Berlioz?

JACQUES

I brought Johana to meet you.

UNCLE LOUIS

Are you crazy?  I have no use for a

woman!  Since my accident.

JACQUES

No, no.  Johana is visiting me.

JOHANA

(tentatively)

Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.

(she looks to

Jacques)

JACQUES

(whispering to

Johana)

Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old

amazing guy, isn't he?

JOHANA

I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle

Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS

(to Johana)

Did you bring the cassettes, the

Wagner, the Berlioz?

(pointing to Jacques)

This idiot never listens to anything

I say.  Sometimes I wonder if he

isn't deaf.

UNCLE LOUIS

Where are you from, Henrietta?

JACQUES

(correcting him)

Johana... New York.

UNCLE LOUIS

What kind of name is that?  To be

named after a city?

JACQUES

(smiling)

He doesn't hear too well.

JOHANA

(yelling)

I said I was from New York.

UNCLE LOUIS

(yelling at Jacques)

That explains it!  The best lays are

from New York!

JACQUES

Uncle Louis!

UNCLE LOUIS

No, no.  It's true.  When I was in

New York, oh boy!

(to Johana)

Before my accident, you understand?

(then back to

Jacques)

JACQUES

(impatient)

Uncle Louis!  Johana is my friend.

She's come to stay with me for a

while.

UNCLE LOUIS

Good.  That way I'll see more of

you... Where are you going to stay?

JACQUES

Well... here.

UNCLE LOUIS

(outraged)

In my apartment?

JACQUES

(with a sigh)

It's my apartment.

UNCLE LOUIS

(jumping up)

Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you

were an orphan I nursed you at my

breast.

JACQUES

Uncle Louis, we have a guest!

UNCLE LOUIS

I'm going to put a lock on the

telephone.

(them calming down,

to Johana)

Did you bring the cassettes?

JACQUES

(solicitously)

You think it'll be all right?

You'll be comfortable here?

JOHANA

(catching her breath)

It's going to be... interesting.

ROBERTO

(glancing at his

watch)

... It's not like him to be late.

Of course sometimes he doesn't show

up at all.  Once in Capri, he...

JOHANA

(interrupting)

We get the picture, Roberto.

(looks over her

shoulder)

Jacques, I think Louis needs help.

UNCLE LOUIS

(yelling)

Two dollars for this!  This fish

wasn't caught.  It died of cancer!

ROBERTO

(pointing)

Here he comes!

ENZO

Jacques!  Johana!

JOHANA

Enzo!

JACQUES

Enzo!

ROBERTO

(meaning the speed

boat)

Where did you get that?

ENZO

(meaning Bonita)

"That"!  This is not a "that"...

This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous

Spanish actress.

(whispering to

Bonita)

... Who is going to be careful with

the varnish...

(back to Roberto)

And who has come to spend a few days

with us.

(and very quickly)

Where's Mamma?

ROBERTO

(checking watch)

You have eight hours before she gets

here.

ENZO

He's really going totally deaf!

UNCLE LOUIS

I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my

boy!  You take care of your eyes,

I'll take care of my ears!

ENZO

(laughing)

I'm sorry Uncle Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS

Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might

just save us from your bullshit.

JACQUES

I'm glad you could come.  I want you

to meet Enzo.

LAWRENCE

(with a smile)

So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?

ENZO

(with an even bigger

smile)

In the flesh.  I have that honor!

BONITA

You're going to live here

permanently?

JOHANA

... Maybe, if Jacques will let me

fix up the place a little.

BONITA

(wistfully)

He's shy, not like Enzo.

JOHANA

Yes.  Not like Enzo.

BONITA

(putting on

eyelashes)

I think, he's really nice... He's a

funny guy... sometimes even very

moving.

JOHANA

(after a long

silence)

... I'm pregnant, Bonita!

BONITA

Are you going to keep it?

JOHANA

Yes.

BONITA

Does he know?

JOHANA

No.

BONITA

(thinking)

Maybe you should talk to him about

it.

JOHANA

I can't... I just don't know how

to...

JOHANA

I was thinking of something kinda

stupid last night.  You know those

women in the greek mythology that

made love with the Gods.  Take Leda

for example, sleeping with Jupiter,

who came to earth as a swan... Well,

can you imagine Leda announcing to

her swan "You're going to be a

father, my little chick-a-dee"?

BONITA

(starts laughing)

But your man isn't quite a God!

JOHANA

(smiles)

Probably not, but I still don't have

the nerve to tell him.

BONITA

Well, you're going to have to tell

him, sometime!

JOHANA

And you...?  Do you love Enzo?

BONITA

(earnestly)

Very much, I think.

(a beat)

But, there's going to be a problem.

ROBERTO

(desperately)

Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de

pesci.  Sono buoni.

MAMMA MOLINARI

(eyeing Bonita)

Nothing.  I'm not hungry.

ENZO

Mamma, Bonita is an actress like

Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani...

BONITA

(icy)

Sarah Bernardt.  I sing too... a

hell of a Carmen.  Want to hear?

MAMMA MOLINARI

(coldly)

No thank you.

JACQUES

Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's

mother Signora Molinari from

Amorgos?

UNCLE LOUIS

(screaming)

The whale!  How could I forget?

Always was something fishy about

that woman!

UNCLE LOUIS

What were Italians doing living in

Greece anyway?

JACQUES

Louis, we were French!

UNCLE LOUIS

That's different!  What's the matter

with you?

ROBERTO

(complete panic)

Mamma, pesce di spada?

UNCLE LOUIS

(to Mamma)

Hey, whale!  Can you pass down the

squids?

ENZO

A shit dive.

ENZO

Those goddamned frogmen doctors

waiting around at 200 feet they just

kill your concentration.

NOVELLI

They're required by law.

ENZO

(climbing off

platform)

There's no law down there!  The only

law is what your lungs can take.

(to the next diver)

... Have fun!  They waiting for you

down there, to take the temperature

of your ass.

ENZO

(defensively)

Anybody can have a bad day!

JACQUES

I've had many... when the sea

doesn't want you.

ENZO

(disgusted)

It's never the sea!  It's Roberto,

Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh

shit!  Jacques, what do you know?

Go do your Hindu exercises and don't

break my balls!

JOHANA

Well, how was it?

JACQUES

(sadly)

Enzo had a bad day.

JOHANA

(tense)

And you?

JACQUES

I didn't dive.

JOHANA

(she takes the

magazine)

You'll try again tomorrow?

JACQUES

I don't know... it didn't feel

right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

JOHANA

You forgot your magazine!

JACQUES

What?

JOHANA

... Nothing.

DISSOLVE TO:

ENZO

Let them try.

BONITA

I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.

JOHANA

You're leaving?

BONITA

Yes...

(she hands her a

note)

Could you please give this to Enzo.

JOHANA

Of course.

BONITA

It's no use... Just tell him I said

goodbye... And give him a kiss for

me, Okay?

JOHANA

(sorry)

Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged

so easily.

BONITA

I don't have the strength to fight

off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to

spend their whole life waiting at

the end of a pier.

BONITA

Did you tell him?

JOHANA

Not yet... I'm waiting for the right

moment.

BONITA

... You take care of yourself,

Johana.

JACQUES

(smiling)

Good huh?

LAWRENCE

He really was unbelievable, 328

feet, deeper than the world

record...

(then eagerly)

... And, Jacques!  He held his

breath for four minutes and fifty

seconds!

JACQUES

(smiles too)

Good... I guess I have tomorrow's

work cut out for me as Enzo would

say...

LAWRENCE

(seriously)

You must be very careful, Jacques.

At these depths, to hold your breath

for over five minutes is... You'd

really be pushing it.  I think it's

very, very dangerous.

JACQUES

(yelling)

Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!

ENZO

(in answer to the

crowd's applause)

Thank you, thank you very much!

NOVELLI

... Now I'm sure you've heard that

some people have suggested it is too

dangerous for us to continue.

Dangerous, because we don't know how

to measure the physiological

consequences of this type of dive

and also because the scuba divers

are not used to going down below 300

feet.

NOVELLI

But, we polled the free divers and

they insist that the competition

continue!

ENZO

(yelling)

Good luck to you all!

ENZO

(smiling to his

brother)

Fabulous, what a dive, huh?

ENZO

He's right.  What's the point of

knocking yourself out?

JOHANA

(softly)

What are you doing?

JACQUES

I'm putting you on the coin... Your

essence... That way you'll always be

with me when I dive.

NOVELLI

(stunned)

360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!!

JACQUES

(pointing at taxi)

... There's a party at the hotel

tonight.

ENZO

(busy)

That's good.

JACQUES

(after a beat)

Enzo, don't be angry.  I was

lucky... that's all.

ENZO

(serious)

I'll see you in Amorgos.

JOHANA

Jacques...?

JACQUES

You go back, I'll walk.

JACQUES

(sadly)

I won today.  I dove very deep,

Tina.

JACQUES

What's so funny?  Can you dive

deeper?

JACQUES

(smiling)

So you understand everything?

JACQUES

That's good... So tell me why

they're all angry at me?  Why is

Enzo angry?  I never wanted to

compete with him.  I never wanted to

be champion of anything... All I

want is to escape from them all...

For just a few minutes, no people...

No noise... Nothing but the sea.

JACQUES

Do you really understand me?  Huh?

Are we actually having a

conversation here?

JACQUES

All right then, tell me:  can I ever

dive as deep as you?  Stay under as

long...?

JACQUES

Are you sure?

JACQUES

It's beautiful, isn't it?

JACQUES

What's wrong?

JOHANA

It's nothing.  Just the long trip.

I'm a little jet-lagged.

JACQUES

You want to lie down for a while?

JOHANA

No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand

me a glass of water?

ENZO

Is he here?

ROBERTO

(uncomfortable)

He's training.

ENZO

Okay, now we have a good five

minutes to have a nice peaceful

talk.

JOHANA

What are you doing here?

ENZO

Checking out the competition.

JOHANA

Enzo, why do you guys do this?

ENZO

(teasing)

What else is there?

JOHANA

(seriously)

You know what I'm talking about.

Why do you and Jacques risk your

lives diving?

ENZO

(avoiding the

question)

You risk your life when you cross

the street.

JOHANA

(frustrated)

Damn it!  Why won't you give me a

straight answer, for once?!

ENZO

Because you'd laugh.

JOHANA

I won't, I swear.

ENZO

(seriously)

I dive in search of God.  If I go

deep enough I'm going to find him.

To me, the sea is a religion... That

surprises you, doesn't it?

JOHANA

(looking down at

Jacques in the

water)

A little... You think it's the same

for Jacques?

ENZO

(shaking his head)

No.  Jacques is a creature of the

sea.  He isn't meant to live on

earth, among us... You should know

this, Johana.

JOHANA

(reassuring herself)

He can learn.  He is learning.

ENZO

You really think so?  Did you tell

him you were pregnant?

JOHANA

(surprised)

How do you know that?

ENZO

You told Bonita, but you didn't tell

him, right?

JOHANA

... Not yet.

ENZO

Don't.

JOHANA

Why?

ENZO

Because he won't understand and it

will just hurt you... Jacques has

been put on earth by complete

mistake.  And he's only waiting for

one thing:  that some God up there

will turn him into a fish!  How long

has that moron been down there?

JOHANA

(looking at the

stopwatch)

Five minutes and fifty seconds.

ENZO

(grabbing away the

stopwatch)

That idiot!

JOHANA

Is he alright?  What happened?

ENZO

(furious)

The fool was asleep!  If I weren't

around, he'd already be dead!!!  Is

that who you want to live with?

Well, good luck!  You better learn

to look after him because I won't

always be here to do it!

JACQUES

(mumbling)

... How long was I asleep?

ENZO

(to Jacques)

Long enough to die.  Listen, if you

really want to die, that's your

problem, but don't do it under my

nose, okay?

ENZO

(to Jacques)

I'll never let you take away my

title.  D'you hear me?  Never!

JOHANA

Do you ever sometimes just stop and

think how sweet life can be?

JACQUES

... Sure.

JOHANA

... When you dive... with that

machine... What does it feel like?

JACQUES

(after thinking about

it)

... The feeling of slipping without

falling... The hardest is once you

are at the bottom.

JOHANA

Why?

JACQUES

Because you have to find a good

reason to come back up again... And

I always have a hard time finding

one.

ENZO

(smiling)

... You should start playing the

piano, the piano is really

refreshing, it clears the sinuses.

Very good the piano!  Tomorrow is

going to be a big day!

LAWRENCE

... When I analyzed the data from

Mayol's last dive, it became

apparent...

(taps the graph

paper)

... At the depths these men are

diving, it is a physiological

impossibility that they can retain

enough oxygen in their blood to make

it back to the surface.  It's a

function of how long it takes to get

to the bottom, orient themselves and

to return... To attempt to break

Mayol's record is simple suicide.

(to Novelli)

For the last time.  I'm telling you

cancel the competition.

MEDIC

Molinari's a seventeen time world

champion.  Do you want to tell him

he can't dive.

NOVELLI

Get Mayol in here.

JACQUES

Enzo?

(no response)

Enzo... I know you're angry at me.

(no response)

Enzo, it's important.

ENZO

I'm concentrating.

JACQUES

(quickly)

We can't dive anymore.  They want to

cancel the competition for a while.

JACQUES

(rushing on)

It's not safe, they say.  The

doctors say it isn't possible to go

deeper and live.  Free diving is

over as a sport.

ENZO

You say that because you have the

title!

JACQUES

No!  I would never cheat you.

ENZO

Well that's very nice of you.

ENZO

(faintly)

You were right.

JACQUES

(moved)

... I was right about what?

ENZO

(after a long

silence)

... It is much better down there.

It's a better place.

ENZO

... Push me back in the water...

JACQUES

(crying)

I can't.

ENZO

Jacques, take me back down...

Please.

LAWRENCE

Just give him five minutes!  What

does it matter now, anyway... Come

on, just leave him alone!

A DOCTOR

(listening to his

heartbeat)

The heart is going to stop!  The

stimulator, quickly.

A DOCTOR

The heart started again!  It's all

right!

LAWRENCE

Take this.  Have a good sleep.

LAWRENCE

Sweet dreams.

JACQUES

(tenderly to Johana,

who had started to

leave the room)

Kiss me.

JOHANA

Sleep now.  We'll talk later.

ROBERTO

I've packed all of... Enzo's

clothes.

(a beat)

I'm going to the radio telephone...

(swallowing)

... to call Mamma.

JOHANA

I'll go see how he's doing.

LAWRENCE

Let him sleep.

JOHANA

(in a panic)

Jacques... Are you alright?

JOHANA

(still worried)

Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer

me!  Are you alright?

JOHANA

You've got to tell me what happened?

JACQUES

I saw how it has to be.

JOHANA

Jacques, you know I love you.

JACQUES

(after a silence)

Don't be sad... It's not because of

you, it's me.  It's all going on

inside me!

(a beat)

I've gotta go and see.

JOHANA

See what?  There is nothing to see!

It's pitch black down there!  It's

cold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at

me, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist!

Look!!!

(she starts waving

her arms)

I'm real!  I am not a dream!

Jacques will you look at me?

(she breaks down)

Please!

JOHANA

Jacques?  I'm pregnant.

JACQUES

That's good... that's wonderful.

It's wonderful for you.

JOHANA

You are the father.

JOHANA

(after a while)

I lied... to keep you here.

JOHANA

Promise me one thing.

JACQUES

Anything.

JOHANA

Promise you won't forget me.

THE END
