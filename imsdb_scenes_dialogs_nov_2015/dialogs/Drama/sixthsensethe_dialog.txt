CUT TO:

ANNA

It's getting cold.

MALCOLM

That's one fine frame.  A fine

frame it is.

MALCOLM

How much does a fine frame like

that cost, you think?

ANNA

(smiling)

I've never told you...  but you

sound a little like Dr. Seuss when

you're drunk.

MALCOLM

Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,

Anna.

ANNA

Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at

least a couple hundred.  Maybe

three.

MALCOLM

Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a

C.D. rack for the bedroom.

ANNA

Do you know how important this is?

This is big time.

(beat)

I'm going to read it for you,

doctor.

MALCOLM

Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

ANNA

In recognition for his outstanding

achievement in the field of child

psychology, his dedication to his

work, and his continuing efforts to

improve the quality of life for

countless children and their

families, the City of Philadelphia

proudly bestows upon its son Dr.

Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...

the Mayor's Citation for

Professional Excellence.

ANNA

Wow.  They called you their son.

MALCOLM

We can keep it in the bathroom.

MALCOLM

It's not real, Anna.  Some

secretary wrote that up.  Don't

tell me you thought it was real?

MALCOLM

What?

MALCOLM

Don't do the quiet thing.  You know

I hate it.

ANNA

This is an important night for us.

Finally someone is recognizing the

sacrifices you made.  That you have

put everything second, including me,

for those families they're talking

about.

ANNA

They're also saying that my husband

has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift

that allows him to hit a ball over a

fence.  Or a gift that lets him

produce beautiful images on a

canvas...  Your gift teaches

children how to be strong in

situations where most adults would

piss on themselves.

(beat)

Yes, I believe what they wrote

about you.

MALCOLM

Thank you.

MALCOLM

What are we hugging about again?

ANNA

Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to

be any crying at this celebration.

Just a lot of drinking and sex.

MALCOLM

I would like some red wine in a

glass.

MALCOLM

I would not like it in a mug.  I

would not like it in a jug.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Bulb's out.

ANNA

He's still in the house.

MALCOLM

Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

MALCOLM

(to the stranger)

This is forty-seven Locust Street.

You have broken a window and

entered a private residence.  Do

you understand what I'm saying?

STRANGER

You don't know so many things.

MALCOLM

There are no needles or

prescription drugs of any kind in

this house.

STRANGER

Are you drunk?

STRANGER

Did you get him drunk?

STRANGER

Do you know why you're scared when

you're alone?

STRANGER

I know.

MALCOLM

What do you want?  I don't

understand what you want.

STRANGER

What you promised.

ANNA

--My God.

MALCOLM

--Do I know you?

STRANGER

Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm

Crowe. Recipient of awards from the

Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm

Crowe, he's helped so many children...

And he doesn't even remember my

name?

STRANGER

I was ten when you worked with me.

STRANGER

Downtown clinic?  Single parent

family?

(beat)

I had a possible mood disorder...

(beat)

I had no friends... you said I was

socially isolated.

(beat)

I was afraid -- you called it acute

anxiety...

(beat)

You were wrong.

(beat)

Come on, clear your head...  Male,

nine...  Single parent...  Mood

discorder... Acute anxiety.

STRANGER

I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my

system twenty-four hours a day...

I still have no friends.  I still

have no peace.  I'm still afraid.

STRANGER

...I'm still afraid.

MALCOLM

Please give me a second to think.

MALCOLM

Bed Freidken?

STRANGER

Some people call me freak.

MALCOLM

...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

STRANGER

I am a freak.

MALCOLM

--Vincent?

MALCOLM

Vincent Gray?

MALCOLM

I do remember you, Vincent.  You

were a good kid.  Very smart...

Quiet...  Compassionate...

Unusually compassionate...

VINCENT

You forgot cursed.

VINCENT

You failed me.

MALCOLM

(whispers)

Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help

you...  I can try to help you now.

COLE

(soft)

Pro... Fun... Add...

MALCOLM

It's okay, Cole.  Don't be

frightened.

MALCOLM

My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I

was supposed to meet you today.

Sorry I missed our appointment.

MALCOLM

Do you mind if I sit down?  I have

this injury from a couple of years

ago and it flares up every once in

a while just so I won't forget it.

MALCOLM

Your eye frames.  They don't seem to

have any lenses in them.

COLE

(soft)

They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt

my eyes.

MALCOLM

I knew there was a sound explanation.

MALCOLM

What was that you were saying

before with your soldiers?  Day pro

fun.

COLE

...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

COLE

It's called Latin.  It's a

language.

MALCOLM

All your soldiers speak Latin?

COLE

No, just one.

MALCOLM

I like churches, too.

(beat)

In olden times, in Europe, people

used to hide in churches.  Claim

sanctuary.

COLE

What were they hiding from?

MALCOLM

Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad

people for one.  People who wanted

to imprison them.  Hurt them.

COLE

Nothing bad can happen in a church,

right?

MALCOLM

Right.

COLE

I forgot your name.

MALCOLM

Dr. Crowe.

COLE

You're a doctor.  What kind?

MALCOLM

I work with young people who might

be sad or upset or just want to

talk.  I try to help them figure

things out.

COLE

Are you a good doctor?

MALCOLM

I got an award once.  From the

Mayor.

COLE

Congratulations.

MALCOLM

Thank you.  It was a long time ago.

I've kind of been retired for a

while.

(beat)

You're my very first client back.

COLE

You use needles?

MALCOLM

No.

COLE

Not even little ones that aren't

supposed to hurt?

MALCOLM

No.

COLE

That's good.

COLE

I'm going to see you again, right?

MALCOLM

If it's okay with you?

COLE

It's okay with me.

MALCOLM

And Cole, next time I won't be late

for you.

COLE

Next time I won't be scared of you.

MALCOLM

It's me.

LYNN

Cole.

LYNN

Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

LYNN

You got a spot.

LYNN

(shaken)

Something you were looking for,

baby?

COLE

(shaken)

Pop Tarts.

LYNN

They're right here.

COLE

Oh.

COLE

What are you thinking, Momma?

LYNN

Lots of things.

COLE

Anything bad about me?

LYNN

Look at my face.

LYNN

I wasn't thinking anything bad

about you, got it?

COLE

Got it.

COLE

(soft)

That's Tommy, Momma.

LYNN

Don't you want this?

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm

around your shoulder" bit.  I just

made it up.  Went with it.  That's

what great actors do.  It's called

improv.

TOMMY

(taunting)

Be careful...  I hope no one jumps

out and gets you.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

LYNN

(whispers)

How was school, baby?

LYNN

(whispers)

You know, you can tell me things if

you need to.

LYNN

(whispers)

Well, you know what I did today?

LYNN

(whispers)

I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in

the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate

a big picnic in the park with lots

of chocolate mouses pie and then

swam in the fountain all afternoon...

(smiling)

What did you do?

COLE

(whispers)

I was picked first for kickball

teams at recess.  I hit a grand

slam to win the game and everyone

lifted me up on their shoulders and

carried me around cheering.

LYNN

I'll make triangle pancakes.  You

got an hour.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

You want to sit?

MALCOLM

Don't feel like talking right now?

MALCOLM

How about we play a game first?

MALCOLM

It's a mind-reading game...  Did I

mention I could read minds?

MALCOLM

Here's the game.  I'll read your

mind.  If what I say is right, you

take a step forwards the chair.  If

I'm wrong, you take a step

backwards the doorway.  If you

reach the chair, you sit.  If you

reach the door, you can go.  Deal?

MALCOLM

Just after your mom and dad were

divorced, your mom went to a doctor

like me and it didn't help her.

And so you think I'm not going to

help you.

MALCOLM

You're worried because she said she

told him things.  Things she

couldn't tell anybody else.

(beat)

Secrets.

MALCOLM

You have a secret.  But you don't

want to tell me.

MALCOLM

(whispers)

You don't have to tell me your

secret if you don't want to.

MALCOLM

Your father gave you that watch as

a present before he left.

COLE

He forgot it in a drawer.  It

doesn't work.

MALCOLM

You don't like to say much at

school.  You're an excellent

student however.  You've never been

in any kind of serious trouble.

COLE

We were supposed to draw a picture.

Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.

He got hurt in the neck by another

man with a screwdriver.

MALCOLM

You saw that on T.V., Cole?

COLE

Everybody got upset.  They had a

meeting.  Momma started crying.

(beat)

I don't draw like that anymore.

MALCOLM

How do you draw now?

COLE

I draw people with smiles, dogs

running, and rainbows.

(beat)

They don't have meetings about

rainbows.

MALCOLM

(soft)

I guess they don't.

COLE

(whispers)

What am I thinking now?

MALCOLM

You're thinking...

(beat)

I don't know what you're thinking,

Cole.

COLE

(whispers)

I was thinking...  you're nice.

(beat)

But you can't help me.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

I thought you meant the other

Italian restaurant I asked you to

marry me in.

MALCOLM

I'm so sorry.

(beat)

I can't seem to keep track of time.

MALCOLM

It didn't go well today.  Spent

some time after trying to get my

head together.

MALCOLM

They're so similar, Anna.  They

have the same mannerisms.  The same

expressions.  The same thing

hanging over them.

(beat)

It might be some kind of abuse.

MALCOLM

There are cuts on Cole's arms.

Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks

like defensive cuts.

MALCOLM

(beat)

Possibly a teacher, neighbor.

(beat)

I don't think it's the mother.

Just a gut thing.  The way she

deals with him.  It doesn't fit.

(beat)

Hard to say this early.  Could

just be a child climbing a lot of

trees.

MALCOLM

I know I've been kind of out of it

for a long while and you resent it.

You do.  I know you're mad.  I know

it's put some distance between us.

MALCOLM

But I'm getting a second chance

here.  I can't let it slip away.

MALCOLM

(soft)

...Happy Anniversary.

CUT TO:

COLE

You want to ask me a question?

MALCOLM

See, this is why I lose at poker.

Yes, I do have a question.

MALCOLM

What happened to those two?  Being

under tissue paper can't be a good

thing.

COLE

That's Private Jenkins and Private

Kinney.  They got killed.  Private

Jenkins has a baby girl that was

born seven pounds, six ounces.

He's never seen her.  He wanted to

get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania

and hold her...

COLE

Private Kinney's wife is really

sick -- she has something called a

brain anism.

MALCOLM

(soft)

You mean aneurysm.

COLE

Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get

back safe to take care of her.

COLE

It's sad they died, isn't it?

COLE

Don't look at me.

(beat)

I don't like people looking at me

like that.

COLE

Stop looking at me.

MALCOLM

Where should I look then, Cole?

COLE

Look over there.

MALCOLM

It's very unusual for someone your

age to understand the kind of

problems that Private Jenkins and

Private Kinney have or even to be

thinking about them at all...

MALCOLM

It is okay if I look back now?

MALCOLM

Tap the foot once for "No" and

twice for "Yes."

MALCOLM

You wouldn't want to take a walk,

would you?

CUT TO:

COLE

I walk this way to school with

Tommy Tammisimo.

MALCOLM

He your best buddy?

COLE

He hates me.

MALCOLM

You hate him?

MALCOLM

Your mom set that up?

MALCOLM

You ever tell her about how it is

with Tommy?

COLE

I don't tell her a thing.

MALCOLM

Why?

COLE

Cause she doesn't look at me like

everybody and I don't want her to.

I don't want her to know.

MALCOLM

Know what?

COLE

That I'm a freak.

MALCOLM

Listen to me.  You are not a freak.

Don't you believe anybody that

tells you that.  It's bullshit and

you don't have to grow up believing

that.

COLE

You said the "s" word.

MALCOLM

Yeah.  Sorry.

COLE

Is it okay if I do something?  I

have to do something.

COLE

Hi, Mr. Marschal.

MR. MARSCHAL

Guten Tag, Cole.

COLE

What's wrong?

MR. MARSCHAL

Mrs. Marschal.  She went food

shopping.  She's running late.

COLE

Ich Habe Durst.

MR. MARSCHAL

Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to

speak German?

COLE

I just know a couple lines.

MR. MARSCHAL

Yes, you may have a drink.  What

would you like?

COLE

Lemonade, please.

COLE

(sad)

Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

MALCOLM

What about Mrs. Marschal?

COLE

(whispers)

She died a long time ago.

CUT TO:

MR. MARSCHAL

Maybe Jill will play for us when

she gets back.

COLE

Thank you.

MALCOLM

Cole--

MR. MARSCHAL

What's going on there?

MR. MARSCHAL

Is this for me?

MR. MASCHAL

What's this?  Jill's keeping a

diary.

MR. MARSCHAL

She's full of surprises...

MR. MARSCHAL

(whispers)

She hasn't written anything for

some time.

MR. MARSCHAL

Oh no...

COLE

(softly)

Stop looking at me.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

April or March of Eighty-seven.

Two weeks into sessions with

Vincent Gray.  I was treating a

couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,

who had lost their child to

Leukemia.  They were waiting with

Vincent in the reception room of

the downtown clinic.  They were

alone together maybe fifteen

minutes.  When I entered the room,

all three were crying.  The

Wagner's progress from that

afternoon was dramatic and sudden

....  As if some door had been

opened for them.

(beat)

I'm not at all clear what happened

in those fifteen minutes.  But I

now believe Vincent tried to tell

me something, show me something and

I didn't listen.

(beat)

Cole Sear allowed me to witness

something today.

(beat)

This time I'm going to listen.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

"DO NOT ENTER"

...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh

with a lady who works in a toll

booth.

COLE (o.s.)

What if she has to pee when she's

working?  You think she just holds

it?

MALCOLM

I don't know.  I was just thinking

the same thing.

COLE (o.s.)

You ask a lot of questions about my

dad today.  How come?

MALCOLM

Sometimes, we don't even know it,

but we do things to draw attention.

Do things so we can express how we

feel about issues...  Divorce or

whatever.

MALCOLM

One night, as an example...  leave

something on a desk for someone to

find.

MALCOLM

Cole, have you ever heard of

something called free-writing?  Or

free-association writing?

MALCOLM

It's when you put a pencil in your

hand and put the pencil to a paper

and you just start writing...  You

don't think about what you're

writing...  You don't read over

what you're writing...  You just

keep your hand moving.

MALCOLM

After awhile if you keep your hand

moving long enough, words and

thoughts start coming out you

didn't even know you had in you...

Sometimes they're things you heard

from somewhere...  Sometimes

they're feelings deep inside...

(beat)

Have you ever done any free-

association writing, Cole?

MALCOLM

What'd you write?

COLE

Words.

MALCOLM

What kind of words?

COLE

Upset words.

MALCOLM

Did you ever write any upset words

before your father left?

COLE

I don't remember.

MALCOLM

Can you do something for me?

MALCOLM

Think about what you want from our

time together.  What our goal

should be?

COLE

Something I want?

MALCOLM

If we could change something in

your life, anything at all, what

would you like that to be?

MALCOLM

You don't have to answer now.

COLE

Instead of something I want, can I

have something I don't want?

COLE

I don't want to be scared anymore.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

(loud)

Are you calling me?

ANNA (o.s.)

What?  You don't see enough of me

at the store?

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

On my way to the flea market in

Amish country.  Thought maybe you

want to come.  Show me how to buy

at these things.

ANNA (o.s.)

I trust you...  Besides, I don't

know if I'm up for the Amish today.

You can't curse or spit or anything

around them.

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

I thought you'd want to get out.

You've been kind of down.

ANNA (o.s.)

That's very sweet.  I'm okay.

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Do you think I should stop by on my

way back?  Show you what I got?

It's not a problem.

ANNA (o.s.)

You know that's probably not the

best idea.  I'll just wait to see

them in the store.

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Okay.  Fine.  Understood.

(beat)

I'm off then.

ANNA (o.s.)

Don't step in the horse manure.

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Thanks.

MALCOLM

(under his breath)

Give it up, kid.

CUT TO:

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Can anyone guess what city was the

capital of the United States of

America from 1790 to 1800?

MR. CUNNINGHAM

...I'll give you a hint, it's the

city you live in.

CLASS

Philadelphia.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Right...  Philadelphia is one of

the oldest cities in the country.

A lot of generations have lived and

died in this city...  Almost every

place you visit has a history and a

story behind it.

(beat)

Even this school and the grounds

they sit on...  Can anyone guess

what this building was used for a

hundred years ago, before you went

here, before I went to this school

even?

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Yes, Cole?

COLE

They used to hang people here.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

That's not correct.  Where'd you

hear that?

COLE

They'd pull the people in crying

and kissing their families bye...

People watching would spit at them.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Cole, this was a legal courthouse.

Laws were passed here.  Some of the

first laws of this country.  This

building was full of lawyers.

Lawmakers.

COLE

They were the ones who hanged

everybody.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

I don't know which one of these

guys told you that, but they were

just trying to scare you, I think.

COLE

I don't like people looking at me

like that.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Like what?

COLE

Stop it!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

I don't know how else to look--

COLE

You're a stuttering Stanley!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Excuse me?

COLE

You talked funny when you went to

school here.  You talked funny all

the way to high school!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

What--

COLE

You shouldn't laugh at people.  It

makes them feel bad.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

How did you--?

COLE

Stop looking at me.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Who have you been s-speaking to?

COLE

Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering

Stanley!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

Who!

COLE

Stuttering Stanley!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

S-ssstop that!

COLE

Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering

Stanley!

MR. CUNNINGHAM

S-ssssstop it!

COLE

Stuttering--

MR. CUNNINGHAM

--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Hey, big guy.

COLE

I don't want to talk about anything.

MALCOLM

Do you like magic?

MALCOLM

Watch the penny closely.

MALCOLM

I do the magic shake...

MALCOLM

And suddenly the penny has

magically traveled to my left hand...

MALCOLM

But that's not the end of the trick.

With another magic shake, the penny

travels into my shirt pocket...

MALCOLM

But that's still not the end!...  I

do a final magic shake...  and

suddenly...  The penny returns to

the hand where it started from.

COLE

That isn't magic.

MALCOLM

What?

COLE

You just kept the penny in that

hand the whole time...

MALCOLM

Who me?

COLE

I didn't know you were funny.

MALCOLM

I forgot myself.

MALCOLM

Cole...

MALCOLM

One day...

(beat)

You're going to sound just like

them.

COLE

(whispers)

Promise?

MALCOLM

(whispers)

Promise.

CUT TO:

WOMAN (o.s.)

Malcolm, sit your cute butt down

and listen up.

(beat)

Are you listening?

BRIDESMAID

(T.V.)

No doubt about it.  Anna's like my

sister.  You better make her happy...

And I'm not talking about -- mmm

this tastes like real butter --

kind of happy...  I'm talking about

Julie Andrews twirling around like

a mental patient on a mountain top

-- kind of happy.

BRIDESMAID

(T.V.)

You're really lucky.  She's got so

much love for you.  Don't tell her

I told you, but she said she loved

you from the first time she met you

on the street.  She'd do anything

for you.

(crying)

I love you guys.

(more crying)

My nose is running.  Why isn't

someone getting me a tissue?

CUT TO:

"Zoloft Anti-depressant"

COLE

...Then you do the magic shake.

And now the penny moves from my

pocket all the way to the hand it

started in.

BOBBY

That's stupid.

COLE

It's supposed to be funny.

BOBBY

It's stupid.

BOBBY

Give me my penny back.

COLE

(almost inaudible)

...Don't be sad.

BOBBY

(hard)

What'd you say?

COLE

(shaken)

...Nothing.

CUT TO:

LYNN

...He doesn't get invited places.

DARREN'S MOM

It's our pleasure.

LYNN

The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese

party a year ago.  He hid in one of

those purple plastic tunnels and

didn't come out.

DARREN'S MOM

Chuck E. who?

LYNN

Cheese.  It's a kid's place.

LYNN

He's my whole life.

LYNN

I work at an insurance place and at

Penny's, so Cole can go to that

good school.

DARREN'S MOM

J. C. Jenny's?

DARREN'S MOM

(bullshit)

Good for you.

LYNN

I wish I could be like my momma

though.  She always knew what was

wrong.  Knew just what to say.

LYNN

Cole's going through something bad.

He won't talk to me.

(beat)

I'm his momma.

(emotional)

And I don't know what's wrong and

I don't know what to say.

CUT TO:

MRS. WESTON

Did you have the Brie?

MRS. SAUNDERS

It tasted like cheese whiz.

TOMMY

I even got a trailer.

DARREN

For what?  You only had one line.

TOMMY

You're slow, you know that.  The

star of the commercial always has

his own trailer.  You need to think

about your character alone.

TOMMY

Darren, check it out.

DARREN looks down the hall to Cole.

DARREN

My dad made me invite him.

COLE

Happy birthday, Darren.

TOMMY

Something you want to see in there?

COLE

(too quick)

--No.

TOMMY

We're going to put on a pretend

play.  You want to be in it?

COLE

...Okay.

TOMMY

It's called, "Locked in the Dungeon."

DARREN

Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the

one locked in the dungeon.

COLE

Don't!

DARREN'S MOTHER

Who's making that noise?

LYNN

Cole!

LYNN

(desperate whispers)

Help me get him in the car.

CUT TO:

LYNN

What's wrong with Cole?

DR. HILL

The tests indicate he did not have

a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.

After some rest, he could go home

tonight.

MALCOLM

There's something else going on,

Lynn.

LYNN

What is it?

DR. HILL

There are some scratches and

bruises on your son that concern me.

MALCOLM

Oh, man.

LYNN

Those are from sports, from playing.

He's not the most coordinated kid,

but I don't want him to stop trying,

you know what I mean?

DR. HILL

Mrs. Sloan over there is our social

worker at the hospital.  She's

going to ask you some procedural

questions.

LYNN

You think I hurt my child?

(emotional)

You think I'm a bad mother?

DR. HILL

At this point it's just procedure.

And you should probably calm down.

MALCOLM

How do you expect her to react?

LYNN

You want me to answer your

questions?

DR. HILL

(sarcastic)

I'm sorry if I was being vague --

yes, I do.

LYNN

Who's going to answer mine, you

dick.

LYNN

(raising voice)

What happened to my child today?

LYNN

Something was happening to him --

physically happening.  Something

was very wrong.

LYNN

How long will these questions take?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

I've decided we shouldn't schedule

sessions anymore.  I'll just follow

you around.

MALCOLM

Your father ever tell you bedtime

stories?

COLE

Yes.

MALCOLM

Once upon a time there was a prince,

who was being driven around...  He

drove around for a long, long time...

Driving and driving...  It was a

long trip...  He fell asleep...

(beat)

When he woke up, they were still

driving...  The long drive went on--

COLE

Dr. Crowe.

MALCOLM

Yes.

COLE

You haven't told bedtime stories

before?

MALCOLM

No.

COLE

You have to add some twists and

stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas.

MALCOLM

No gas...  Hey, that's good.

COLE

Tell me a story about why you're

sad.

MALCOLM

Do you think I'm sad?

MALCOLM

What makes you think that?

COLE

Your eyes told me.

MALCOLM

(rote)

I'm not supposed to talk about

stuff like that.

MALCOLM

...Once upon a time there was this

person named Malcolm.  He worked

with children.  Loved it more than

anything.

(smiles)

Then one night, he finds out he

made a mistake with one of them.

Didn't help that one at all.  He

thinks about that one a lot.  Can't

forget.

(beat)

Ever since then, things have been

different.  He's become messed up.

Confused.  Angry.  Not the same

person he used to be.

(beat)

His wife doesn't like the person

he's become.  They don't speak

anymore.  They're like strangers.

MALCOLM

And then one day this person

Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who

reminds him of that one.  Reminds

him a lot of that one.  Malcolm

decides to try to help this new boy.

He thinks maybe if he can help this

boy, it would be like helping that

one too.

MALCOLM

I don't know how the story ends.

I hope it's a happy ending.

COLE

Me too.

COLE

I want to tell you my secret now.

MALCOLM

Okay.

COLE

...I see people.

COLE

I see dead people...  Some of them

scare me.

MALCOLM

In your dreams?

MALCOLM

When you're awake?

MALCOLM

Dead people, like in graves and

coffins?

COLE

No, walking around, like regular

people...  They can't see each

other.  Some of them don't know

they're dead.

MALCOLM

They don't know they're dead?

COLE

I see ghosts.

COLE

They tell me stories...  Things

that happened to them...  Things

that happened to people they know.

MALCOLM

How often do you see them?

COLE

All the time.  They're everywhere.

(beat)

You won't tell anyone my secret,

right?

MALCOLM

...No.

COLE

Will you stay here till I fall

asleep?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Cole...

(beat)

His pathology is more severe than

initially assessed.

(beat)

He's suffering from visual

hallucinations, paranoia --

Symptoms of some kind of school age

Schizophrenia.

(beat)

Medication and hospitalization may

be required.

MALCOLM

(whispers)

I'm not helping him.

WOMAN

TOMMY

(Decent British accent)

There once was a boy, very

different than other boys.  He

lived in the jungle, and he could

talk with the animals.

CUT TO:

COLE

Did you think the play sucked big

time?

MALCOLM

What?

COLE

Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough

syrup commercial.  He thought

everybody was self-conscious and

unrealistic.  He said the play

sucked big time.

MALCOLM

I know every child is special in

their own way, but Tommy sounds

like a punk.

(Cole smiles)

I thought the play was excellent.

Better than Cats.

COLE

Cats?

MALCOLM

Never mind.

MALCOLM

Cole, I was really interested in

what you told me in the hospital,

I'd like to hear more about it.

MALCOLM

What's wrong?

MALCOLM

Is something in there?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

What is it?

MALCOLM

I don't see.

COLE

Be real still.

COLE

Sometimes you feel it inside.

Like you're falling down real fast,

but you're really just standing

still.

COLE

You ever feel prickly things on the

back of your neck?

MALCOLM

Yes?

COLE

And the tiny hairs on your arm.

Are they all standing up?

MALCOLM

-- Yes.

COLE

(whispers)

When they get mad, it gets cold.

MALCOLM

Them?

MALCOLM

I don't see anything.

(beat)

Are you sure they're there?

(beat)

Cole?

COLE

Please make them leave.

MALCOLM

(whispers)

I'm working on it.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

(whispers)

...Is anyone there?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM (o.s.)

Look, he's an eight-year-old child.

He's my only client.  If he invites

me to his play, I'm not thinking

about how late I get back...  I go.

I have to go.  You know that.

That's the only way I know how to

work.

(beat)

Vincent said I failed him.

(raising his voice)

I WON'T GIVE COLE A CHANCE TO SAY

THOSE WORDS TO ME!  I WON'T!

MALCOLM (o.s.)

Please let it ring.

ANNA

I can't talk now.

ANNA

(whispers)

I thought about you too.

CUT TO:

LYNN

I don't care what they say, this

thing is definitely broken.

TOMMY

(on T.V.)

Mommy, my throat hurts.

NARRATOR

(on T.V.)

Pediaease Cough Suppressant...

gentle, fast, effective.

LYNN

Take 'em off.

LYNN

I don't want them on my table.

LYNN

I saw what was in your bureau

drawer when I was cleaning.

LYNN

You got something you want to

confess?

LYNN

The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you

keep taking it?

LYNN

It was Grandma's.  It's not for

playing.

(beat)

What if it broke?  You know how sad

I'd be.

COLE

You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma

so much.

LYNN

(soft)

That's right.  So why do you take

it, sweetheart?

COLE

Sometimes people think they lose

things and they didn't really lose

them.  It just gets moved.

LYNN

Did you move the bumble bee pendant?

LYNN

You didn't take it before.  You

didn't take it the time after that.

And now, you didn't take it again?

COLE

Don't get mad.

LYNN

So who moved it?

LYNN

There's only two of us.

(beat)

Maybe someone came in our house --

took the bumble bee pendant out of

my closet, and then laid it nicely

in your drawer?

(beat)

Is that what happened?

COLE

(soft)

Maybe.

LYNN

I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in

my body.  I'm tired in my mind.

I'm tired in my heart.  I need a

little help here.

(beat)

I don't know if you noticed -- but

our little family isn't doing so

good.

LYNN

I'm praying for us, but I must not

be praying right.

(beat)

It looks like we're just going to

have to answer each other's prayers.

If we can't talk to each other --

we're not going to make it.

(beat)

Now baby, tell me...  I won't be

mad, honey...  Did you take the

bumble bee pendant?

COLE

No.

LYNN

You've had enough roast beef.  You

need to leave the table.

LYNN

(yells)

Go!

CUT TO:

BOY

Come on...  I'll show you where my

dad keeps his gun...  Come on.

CUT TO:

COLE (o.s.)

Momma.

COLE

If you're not very mad...  Can I

sleep in your room tonight?

LYNN

Look at my face, Cole.

LYNN

I'm not very mad.

LYNN

Baby...  Why are you shaking?

LYNN

Cole, what's wrong?

LYNN

(desperate)

...Please tell me.

LYNN

(crying)

Please.

CUT TO:

ANNA

It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.

Entirely platinum with a mine cut

diamond and an actual color Burmese

Sapphire...  It's timeless.

YOUNG MAN

You got anything a little plainer?

YOUNG WOMAN

Plainer?  You want a plain ring to

go with your plain fiance.  Is that

how it is?

YOUNG MAN

No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.

It's just...  you're so beautiful...

you're like a Burmese Sapphire all

by yourself.  You don't need all

that.

YOUNG WOMAN

(disbelief)

Uh-huh.

ANNA

Why don't you two hold it?

ANNA

Do you feel longing?

YOUNG WOMAN

Excuse me?

ANNA

When I touch this piece I feel a

longing.  I imagine the woman who

owned this, loved a man deeply she

couldn't be with.

YOUNG WOMAN

Did he have wavy hair and broad

shoulders?

ANNA

I don't know...  But maybe...

(beat)

A lot of the pieces in this store

give me feelings.  I think maybe

when people own things and then

they pass away -- a part of

themselves gets printed on those

things -- like fingerprints.

CUT TO:

SEAN

You don't need someone with a

masters.  You need a wrestler guy

whose neck is larger than his head.

ANNA

I need a wrestler with a masters.

SEAN

What's this?

From you?

SEAN

Is it wrestling tights?

ANNA

It's a first edition.

Wow, this is too much.  It's

COLE

You don't wanna ask me questions

today?

COLE

Can I ask you then?

MALCOLM

Yes.

COLE

What do you want more than anything?

MALCOLM

I don't know.

COLE

I told you what I want.

MALCOLM

I don't know, Cole.

COLE

Why don't you think about it for a

while?

MALCOLM

I know what I want.

(beat)

My goal is to speak to my wife.

The way she and I used to speak.

Like there was no one in the world

but us.

COLE

(soft)

How are you going to do that?

MALCOLM

(whispers)

I can't be your doctor anymore.

(beat)

I haven't given my family enough

attention.  Bad things happen when

you do that.  Do you understand?

COLE

You want to go home?

MALCOLM

I have to.

COLE

When?

MALCOLM

Soon.  One week.

MALCOLM

I'm going to transfer you.  I know

two psychologists that are

exceptional--

COLE

(whispers)

Don't fail me.

MALCOLM

--What?

COLE

Don't give up.  You're the only one

who can help me.  I know it.

MALCOLM

You want to know a secret?...  I

was a paper champion.

(beat)

Do you know what that means?

COLE

Don't cry.

MALCOLM

I means I wasn't what everyone

thought I was...

(beat)

I was a fake.

COLE

You weren't a paper champion.

MALCOLM

Someone else can help you.  Someone

else can make you happy.

COLE

Dr. Crowe?

MALCOLM

Yes.

COLE

You believe me, right?

COLE

Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,

right?

MALCOLM

I don't know how to answer that.

COLE

How can you help me if you don't

believe me?

COLE

Some magic's real.

Vincent?

VINCENT

MALCOLM

Did something upset you?

VINCENT

(on tape)

You won't believe.

MALCOLM

I won't believe what?

VINCENT

I don't want to talk anymore.  I

want to go home, okay?  I want to

go home.

MALCOLM

(on tape)

Okay, Vincent, you can go home.

MALCOLM

(on tape)

--about that.  Hope I didn't leave

you too long...  Wow, it's cold in

here--

MALCOLM

a kid, I had this blood test down --

threw up chill cheese fries all

over this male nurse.

Hello again.

COLE

You been running around?

COLE

It makes you feel better?

COLE

I like to run around.  It's good

exercise.

(beat)

You want to ask me questions now?

COLE

You want to be a lance corporal in

Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th

Marines?  We're being dispatched to

the Quang Nam province.

MALCOLM

Maybe later.

COLE

Something happened, didn't it?

MALCOLM

Yes, it did.

COLE

Are you wigging out?

MALCOLM

Yes, I am.

COLE

We're not gonna start crying again,

are we?

MALCOLM

No, we're not.

COLE

What happened?

MALCOLM

These people...  People that died

and are still hanging around.

Maybe they weren't ready to go.

COLE

You really look better.

MALCOLM

Maybe they wake up that morning

thinking they have a thousand

things to do and a thousand days

left to do them in...  And then

all of a sudden, it's all taken

away.  No one asked them.  It's

just gone...

COLE

You have nice red in your cheeks now.

MALCOLM

Do you know what 'Yo no quiero

morir' is?

MALCOLM

It's Spanish.  It means...  'I

don't want to die.'

(beat)

Not all the ghosts are scary, are

they?  Like Mrs. Marschal?

COLE

No.

MALCOLM

What do those ghosts want when they

talk to you?  Think real careful

now, Cole...

COLE

Just help.

MALCOLM

Yes!  I think that's right!...  I

think they all want that.  Even the

scary ones...

COLE

You believe now?

MALCOLM

I believe both of you now.

(beat)

And I think I might know how to

make them go away.

COLE

You do?

MALCOLM

I think they know you're one of

those guys rare people can see them.

(beat)

You need to help them.  Each one of

them.

(beat)

Everyone wants to be heard.

Everyone.

COLE

What if they don't want help?  What

if they're just angry and they want

to hurt somebody?

MALCOLM

I don't think that's the way it

works, Cole.

COLE

How do you know for sure?

MALCOLM

I don't.

I know you're confused.  It's just...

I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.

(beat)

I don't want to be ashamed of that.

I don't want to have to make

excuses for that.

(beat)

And I wanted to tell you...  I

bought your present wholesale from

a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on

it.  You don't need someone cheap

like that.

(beat)

By the way, it's a non-refundable

item, it's scratched on the bottom.

Are you smiling?...  I hope you're

smiling.

We'll see.  You know how you get

sick in the afternoon.

MRS. COLLINS

Don't say it tastes funny.  You

MR. COLLINS

You were keeping her sick...

MRS. COLLINS

Cunningham.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

You're welcome, Cole.

MR. CUNNINGHAM

You know when I was in school,

there was a terrible fire in this

rebuilt the whole thing.

COLE

I know.

Only he who is pure of heart can

MERLIN

Silence village idiot!  Let the boy

step forward.

MERLIN

How come we're so quiet?

MALCOLM

I think we said everything we

Maybe it's time to say things to

someone else?  Someone close to you?

Maybe.

I'm not going to see you anymore,

am I?

MALCOLM

You were great in the play, Cole.

COLE

Really?

MALCOLM

And you know what else?

COLE

What?

MALCOLM

Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

COLE

...Maybe we can pretend we're going

to see each other tomorrow?

COLE

Just for pretend.

MALCOLM

Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...

I'll see you tomorrow.

See you tomorrow.

You're very quiet.

You're mad I missed the play,

I'm ready to communicate with you

now.

LYNN

Communicate?

COLE

Tell you my secrets.

LYNN

What is it?

COLE

You know that accident up there?

LYNN

(confused)

Yeah.

COLE

Someone got hurt.

They did?

A lady.  She died.

Oh my God.

You can see her?

Yes.

They scare me too sometimes.

Dead people.

Dead people?

Ghosts.

You see ghosts, Cole?

They want me to do things for them.

They talk to you?

They tell you to do things?

What are you thinking, Momma?

LYNN

...I don't know.

COLE

You think I'm a freak?

LYNN

Look at my face.

LYNN

I would never think that about you

...  ever... Got it?

COLE

Got it.

LYNN

Just let me think for a second.

COLE

Grandma says hi.

COLE

She says she's sorry for taking the

bumble bee pendant.  She just likes

it a lot.

LYNN

What?

COLE

Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

LYNN

Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's

gone.  You know that.

COLE

I know.

COLE

She wanted me to tell you--

LYNN

(soft)

Cole, please stop.

COLE

She wanted me to tell you, she saw

you dance.

COLE

She said when you were little, you

and her had a fight right before

your dance recital.  You thought

she didn't come to see you dance.

She did.

COLE

She hid in the back so you wouldn't

see...  She said you were like an

angel.

COLE

She said, you came to her where

they buried her.  Asked her a

question...  She said the answer is

"Everyday."

COLE

What did you ask?

Do I make her proud?

has been one very special day...

I wish we all could stay and play.

MALCOLM

What?

MALCOLM

Anna, I never thought I'd feel the

things I'm feeling.  I never

front of my friends and family and

Today I can...

MALCOLM

Anna Crowe...  I am in love.  In

love I am.
