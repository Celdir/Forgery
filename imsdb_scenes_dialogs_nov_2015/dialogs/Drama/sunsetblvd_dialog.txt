A-8     JOE GILLIS' APARTMENT

GILLIS

Yeah.

NO. 1

Joseph C. Gillis?

GILLIS

That's right.

NO. 1

We've come for the car.

GILLIS

What car?

NO. 2

(Consulting a paper)

1946 Plymouth convertible.  Calif-

ornia license 97 N 567.

NO. 1

Where are the keys?

GILLIS

Why should I give you the keys?

NO. 1

Because the company's played ball

with you long enough.  Because

you're three payments behind.  And

because we've got a Court order.

Come on -- the keys.

NO. 2

Or do you want us to jack it up

and haul it away?

GILLIS

Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.

NO. 1

Is that So?

GILLIS

I lent it to a friend of mine.

He took it up to Palm Springs.

NO. 1

Had to get away for his health,

I suppose.

GILLIS

You don't believe me?  Look in

the garage.

NO. 1

Sure we believe you, only now we

want you to believe us.  That car

better be back here by noon tomorrow,

or there's going to be fireworks.

GILLIS

You say the cutest things.

A-9     EXTERIOR OF RUDY'S                   GILLIS' VOICE

I knew they'd be coming

never asked any quest-

ions.  He'd just look at

your heels and know the

score.

A-10    THE ALLEY NEXT TO SIDNEY'S

I had an original story

prove it.

A-11    SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE

SHELDRAKE

All right, Gillis.  You've got

five minutes.  What's your story

about?

GILLIS

It's about a ball player, a rookie

shortstop that's batting 347.  The

poor kid was once mixed up in a hold-

up.  But he's trying to go straight --

except there's a bunch of gamblers

who won't let him.

SHELDRAKE

So they tell the kid to throw the

World Series, or else, huh?

GILLIS

More or less.  Only for the end

I've got a gimmick that's real good.

SHELDRAKE

Got a title?

GILLIS

Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page

outline.

SHELDRAKE

(To the secretary)

Get the Readers' Department and

see what they have on Bases Loaded.

GILLIS

They're pretty hot about it

over at Twentieth, but I

think Zanuck's all wet.  Can

you see Ty Power as a

GILLIS (cont'd)

shortstop?  You've got the best

man for it right here on this lot.

Alan Ladd.  Good change of pace for

Alan Ladd.  There's another thing:

it's pretty simple to shoot.  Lot

of outdoor stuff.  Bet you could

make the whole thing for under a

million.  And there's a great little

part for Bill Demarest.  One of the

trainers, an oldtime player who

got beaned and goes out of his head

sometimes.

BETTY

Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases

Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page

synopsis.

(She holds it out)

But I wouldn't bother.

SHELDRAKE

What's wrong with it?

BETTY

It's from hunger.

SHELDRAKE

Nothing for Ladd?

BETTY

Just a rehash of something that

wasn't very good to begin with.

SHELDRAKE

I'm sure you'll be glad to meet

Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.

SHELDRAKE

This is Miss Kramer.

BETTY

Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And

right now I wish I could crawl

into a hole and pull it in after

me.

GILLIS

If I could be of any help...

BETTY

I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I

just don't think it's any good.

I found it flat and banal.

GILLIS

Exactly what kind of material do

you recommend?  James Joyce?

Dostoosvsky?

SHELDRAKE

Name dropper.

BETTY

I just think pictures should say

a little something.

GILLIS

Oh, you're one of the message

kids.  Just a story won't do.

You'd have turned down Gone With the

Wind.

SHELDRAKE

No, that was me.  I said, Who

wants to see a Civil War picture?

BETTY

Perhaps the reason I hated Bases

Loaded is that I knew your name.

I'd always heard you had some

talent.

GILLIS

That was last year.  This year

I'm trying to earn a living.

BETTY

So you take Plot 27-A, make it

glossy, make it slick --

SHELDRAKE

Carefull Those are dirty words!

You sound like a bunch of New

York critics.  Thank you, Miss

Schaefer.

BETTY

Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

GILLIS

Goodbye.  Next time I'll write

The Naked and the Dead.

SHELDRAKE

Well, seems like Zanuck's got

himself a baseball picture.

GILLIS

Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you

to think I thought this was going

to win any Academy Award.

SHELDRAKE

(His mind free-wheeling)

Of course, we're always looking

for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see

it as a Betty Hutton?

GILLIS

Frankly, no.

SHELDRAKE

(Amusing himself)

Now wait a minute.  If we made

it a girls' softball team, put

in a few numbers.  Might make a

cute musical: It Happened in

the Bull Pen -- the story of a

Woman.

GILLIS

You trying to be funny?  -- because

I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a

barrel and I need a job.

SHELDRAKE

Sure, Gillis.  If something should

come along -

GILLIS

Along is no good.  I need it now.

SHELDRAKE

Haven't got a thing.

GILLIS

Any kind of assignment.  Additional

Dialogue.

SHELDRAKE

There's nothing, Gillis.  Not

even if you were a relative.

GILLIS

(Hating it)

Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you

let me have three hundred bucks

yourself, as a personal loan?

SHELDRAKE

Could I?  Gillis, last year some-

body talked me into buying a ranch

in the valley.  So I borrowed money

from the bank so I could pay for

the ranch.  This year I had to

mortgage the ranch so I could keep

up my life insurance so I could

borrow on the insurance so I could

pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey

had been elected -

GILLIS

Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

GILLIS' VOICE (Cont.)

Then I talked to a couple of

yes men at Twentieth.  To me

they said no.  Finally I

located that agent of mine, the

big faker.  Was he out digging

up a job for poor Joe Gillis?

Hmph! He was hard at work in

Bel Air, making with the golf

clubs.

SKOLSKY

Hello, Gillis.

GILLIS

Hello, Mr. Skolsky.

SKOLSKY

Got anything for the column?

GILLIS

Sure.  Just sold an original for

a hundred grand.  The Life of the

Warner Brothers.  Starring the Ritz

Brothers.  Playing opposite the

Andrew Sisters.

SKOLSKY

(With a sour smile)

But don't get me wrong -- I love

Hollywood.

A-14    THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS

MORINO

So you need three hundred dollars?

Of course, I could give you three

hundred dollars.  Only I'm not

going to.

GILLIS

No?

MORINO

Gillis, get this through your

head.  I'm not just your agent.

It's not the ten per cent.  I'm

your friend.

GILLIS

How's that about your being my

friend?

MORINO

Don't you know the finest things

in the world have been written on

an empty stomach?  Once a talent

like yours gets into that Mocambo-

Romanoff rut, you're through.

GILLIS

Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car

I'm talking about.  If I lose my

car it's like having my legs out off.

MORINO

Greatest thing that could happen

to you.  Now you'll have to sit

behind that typewriter.  Now

you'll have to write.

GILLIS

What do you think I've been doing?

I need three hundred dollars.

MORINO

(Icily)

Maybe what you need is another agent.

A-15    GILLIS IN HIS OPEN CAR

GILLIS' VOICE

just didn't have what it takes,

and the time had come to wrap

up the whole Hollywood deal

and go home.  Maybe if I hocked

all my junk there'd be enough

for a bus ticket back to Ohio,

back to that thirty-five-

dollar-a-week job behind the

copy desk of the Dayton Evening

Post, if it was still open.

Back to the smirking delight

of the whole office.  All

you kept me waitlng so long?

A-3O    THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE

MAX

In here!

GILLIS

I just put my car in the garage.

I had a blow-out.  I thought --

MAX

Go on in.

GILLIS

Look, maybe I'd better take my

car --

MAX

Wipe your feet!

MAX

You are not dressed properly.

GILLIS

Dressed for what?

THE WOMAN'S VOICE

Max!  Have him come up, Max!

MAX

(Gesturing)

Up the stairs!

GILLIS

Suppose you listen just for a

minute -

MAX

Madame is waiting.

GILLIS

For me?  Okay.

A-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL

MAX

(From below)

If you need help with the

coffin call me.

WOMAN'S VOICE

This way!

NORMA

In here.  I put him on my massage

table in front of the fire.  He

always liked fires and poking at

them with a stick.

A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM

NORMA

I've made up my mind we'll bury him in

the garden.  Any city laws against that?

GILLIS

I wouldn't know.

NORMA

I don't care anyway.  I want the

coffin to be white.  And I want

it specially lined with satin.

White, or deep pink.

NORMA

Maybe red.  bright flaming red.

Gay.  Let's make it gay.

NORMA

How much will it be?  I warn you -

don't give me a fancy price just

because I'm rich.

GILLIS

Lady.  you've got the wrong man.

GILLIS

I had some trouble with my car.

Flat tire.  I pulled into your

garage till I could get a spare.

I thought this was an empty house.

NORMA

It is not.  Get out.

GILLIS

I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost

your friend, and I don't think red

is the right color.

NORMA

Get out.

GILLIS

Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't

I seen you -- ?

NORMA

Or shall I call my servant?

GILLIS

I know your face.  You're Norma

Desmond.  You used to be in

pictures.  You used to be big.

NORMA

I am big.  It's the pictures

that got small.

GILLIS

I knew there was something

wrong with them.

NORMA

They're dead.  They're finished.

There was a time when this busi-

ness had the eyes of the whole

wide world.  But that wasn't good

enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the

ears of the world, too.  So they

opened their big mouths, and out

came talk, talk, talk...

GILLIS

That's where the popcorn business

comes in.  You buy yourself a bag

and plug up your ears.

NORMA

Look at them in the front offices --

the master minds! They took the

idols and smashed them.  The

Fairbankses and the Chaplins and

the Gilberts and the Valentinos.

And who have they got now?  Some

nobodies -- a lot of pale little

frogs croaking pish-poshl

GILLIS

Don't get sore at me.  I'm not

an executive.  I'm just a writer.

NORMA

You are! Writing words, words!

You've made a rope of words and

strangled this businessl But there

is a microphone right there to catch

the last gurgles, and Technicolor

to photograph the red, swollen tongue!

GILLIS

Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.

NORMA

Get out!

GILLIS

Next time I'll bring my autograph

album along, or maybe a hunk of

cement and ask for your footprints.

NORMA

Just a minute, you!

GILLIS

Yeah?

NORMA

You're a writer, you said.

GILLIS

Why?

NORMA

Are you or aren't you?

GILLIS

I think that's what it says on my

driver's license.

NORMA

And you have written pictures,

haven't you?

GILLIS

Sure have.  The last one I

wrote was about cattle rustlers.

Before they were through with it,

the whole thing played on a

torpedo boat.

NORMA

I want to ask you something.

Come in here.

A-33    THE HUGE LIVING ROOM

NORMA

The wind gets in that blasted

pipe organ.  I ought to have

it taken out.

GILLIS

Or teach it a better tune.

NORMA

How long is a movie script these

days?  I mean, how many pages?

GILLIS

Depends on what it is -- a Donald

Duck or Joan or Arc.

NORMA

This is to be a very important

picture.  I have written it

myself.  Took me years.

GILLIS

(Looking at the piles

of script)

Looks like enough for six impor-

tant pictures.

NORMA

It's the story or Salome.  I

think I'll have DeMille direct it.

GILLIS

Uh-huh.

NORMA

We've made a lot of pictures

together.

GILLIS

And you'll play Salome?

NORMA

Who else ?

GILLIS

Only asking.  I did't know

you were planning a comeback.

NORMA

I hate that word.  It is a return.

A return to the millions of people

who have never forgiven me for

deserting the screen.

GILLIS

Fair enough.

NORMA

Salome -- what a woman! What a

part! The Princess in love with

a Holy man.  She dances the Dance

of the Seven Veils.  He rejects

her, so she demands his head on a

golden tray, kissing his cold, dead

lips.

GILLIS

They'll love it in Pomona.

NORMA

(Taking it straight)

They will love it every place.

(She reaches for a

batch of pages from

the heap)

Read it.  Read the scene just

before she has him killed!

GILLIS

Right now?  Never let another

writer read your stuff.  He

may steal it.

NORMA

I am not afraid.  Read it!

NORMA (Cont'd)

(Calling)

Max!  Max!

(To Gillis)

Sit down.  Is there enough light?

GILLIS

I've got twenty-twenty vision.

NORMA

Bring something to drink.

MAX

Yes.  Madame.

NORMA

I said sit down.

clamped in a curious holder...

I could sense her eyes on me

from behind those dark

glasses, defying me not to

like what I read, or maybe

begging me in her own proud

way to like it.  It meant

so much to her...

feeling a little sick at my

NORMA

(Impatiently)

Well?

GILLIS

This is fascinating.

NORMA

Of course it is.

GILLIS

Maybe it's a little long and

maybe there are some repetitions...

but you're not a professional

writer.

NORMA

I wrote that with my heart.

GILLIS

Sure you did.  That's what makes

it great.  What it needs is a

little more dialogue.

NORMA

What for?  I can say anything I

want with my eyes.

GILLIS

It certainly could use a pair of

shears and a blue pencil.

NORMA

I will not have it butchered.

GILLIS

Of course not.  But it ought to

be organized.  Just an editing

job.  You can find somebody.

NORMA

Who?  I'd have to have somebody

I can trust.  When were you born --

I mean, what sign of the zodiac?

GILLIS

I don't know.

NORMA

What month?

GILLIS

December twenty-first.

NORMA

Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians.

You can trust them.

GILLIS

Thank you.

NORMA

I want you to do this work.

GILLIS

Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished

one script.  I'm due on another

assignment.

NORMA

I don't care.

GILLIS

You know, I'm pretty expensive.

I get five hundred a week.

NORMA

I wouldn't worry about money.

I'll make it worth your while.

GILLIS

Maybe I'd better take the rest

of the script home and read it -

NORMA

Oh no.  I couldn't let it out

of my house.  You'll have to

finish it here.

GILLIS

It's getting kind of late --

NORMA

Are you married, Mr.  -- ?

GILLIS

The name is Gillis.  I'm single.

NORMA

Where do you live?

GILLIS

Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart-

ments.

NORMA

There's something wrong with

your car, you said.

GILLIS

There sure is.

NORMA

You can stay here.

GILLIS

I'll come early tomorrow.

NORMA

Nonsense.  There's room over the

garage.  Max will take you there...Max!

ber One Vamp of another era.  I

remember a rather florid des-

cription in an old fan magazine

which said: "Her eyes are like

two moonlit waterholes, where

strange animals come to drink."

GILLIS

How did you know I was going to

stay, this afternoon?

A-37    A GABLED BEDROOM

MAX

This room has not been used for

a long time.

GILLIS

It will never make house Beautiful.

I guess it's O.K. for one night.

MAX

(Pointing)

There is the bathroom.  I put in

soap and a toothbrush.

GILLIS

Thanks.

(He starts taking off

his coat)

Say, she's quite a character,

that Norma Desmond.

MAX

She was the greatest.  You wouldn't

know.  You are too young.  In one

week she got seventeen thousand fan

letters.  Men would bribe her mani-

curist to get clippings from her

fingernails.  There was a Maharajah

who came all the way from Hyderabad

to get one of her stockings.  Later,

he strangled himself with it.

GILLIS

I sure turned into an interesting

Why are you so upset?  Is there

anything missing?

I did.

I don't know why you should be

so upset.  Stop that playing,

It seemed like a good idea --

if we are to work together.

You'll like it here.

I have my own apartment.

You can't work in an apartment

where you owe three months' rent.

I'll take care of that.

It's all taken care of.  It's

all paid for.

I'm used to paying my own bills.

You proud boy, why didn't you tell

me you were having difficulties.

Okay.  We'll deduct it from my

salary.

Now, now, don't let's be small

about such matters.  We won't

keep books.

heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All

hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight

thousand dollars.

take me for rides in the

B-22   INSIDE THE CAR              hills above Sunset.

NORMA

That's a dreadful shirt you're

wearing.

GILLIS

What's wrong with It?

NORMA

Nothing, if you work in a fill-

ing station.  And I'm getting

rather bored with that sport

jacket, and those same baggy

pants.

(She picks up

the car phone)

Max, what's a good men's shop

in town?  The very best...

Well, go there !

GILLIS

I don't need any clothes, and

I certainly don't want you buy-

ing them for --

NORMA

Why begrudge me a little fun?

I just want you to look nice,

my stray little boy.

NORMA

There's nothing like gray flannel

with a chalk stripe.

(she points at

the trousers)

This one single-breasted, of course.

(to another salesman)

Now we need a topcoat.  Let's see

what you have in camel's hair.

NORMA

How about some evening clothes?

GILLIS

I don't need a tuxedo.

NORMA

Of course you do.  A tuxedo and

tails.

GILLIS

Tails.  That's ridiculous.

NORMA

You'll need them for parties.

You'll need them for New Year's

Eve.

(to a salesman)

Where are your evening clothes?

SALESMAN

This way, Madame.

SALESMAN

Here are some camel hairs, but

I'd like you just to feel this

one.  It's Vicuna.  Of course,

it's a little more expensive.

GILLIS

A camel's hair will do.

SALESMAN

(With an insulting

inflection)

As long as the lady is paying

for it, why not take the Vicuna?

GILLIS

Whose room was this?

MAX

It was the room of the husband.

Or of the husbands, I should say.

Madame has been married three

times.

GILLIS

I guess this is the one you

can see Catalina from.  Only

this isn't the day.

He proceeds towards the half-opened door leading

to the bathroom.  Something strikes his attention

and he stops.  As in the door to the room above

the garage, this lock, too, has been gouged out.

GILLIS

Hey, what's this with the

door? There isn't any lock.

MAX

There are no locks anywhere

in this house.

GILLIS

How come?

MAX

The doctor suggested it.

GILLIS

What doctor?

MAX

Madame's doctor.  She has moments

of melancholy.  There have been

some suicide attempts.

GILLIS

Uh-huh?

MAX

We have to be very careful.  No

sleeping pills, no razor blades.

We shut off the gas in her bed-

room.

GILLIS

Why?  Her career?  She got enough

out of it.  She's not forgotten.

She still gets those fan letters.

MAX

I wouldn't look too closely at the

postmarks.

GILLIS

You send them.  Is that it, Max?

MAX

I'd better press your evening

clothes, sir.  You have not for-

gotten Madame's New Year's party.

GILLIS

No, I haven't.  I suppose all

the waxworks are coming?

MAX

I don't know, sir.  Madame made

the arrangements.

Perfect.  Wonderful shoulders.

And I love that line.

GILLIS

All padding.  Don't let it fool

you.

NORMA

Come here!

GILLIS

You know, to me dressing up

was always just putting on

my dark blue suit.

NORMA

I don't like those studs they've

sent.  I want you to have pearls.

Nice big pearls.

GILLIS

Now, I'm not going to wear ear-

rings, I can tell you that.

NORMA

Cute.  Let's have some drinks.

GILLIS

Shouldn't we wait for the others?

NORMA

(Pointing at the floor)

Careful, it's slippery.  I

had it waxed.

NORMA

Here's to us.

NORMA

You know, this floor used to

be wood but I had it changed.

Valentino said there is nothing

like tiles for a tango.

GILLIS

Not on the same floor with

Valentino!

GILLIS

The other guests?

NORMA

There are no other guests.  We

don't want to share this night

with other people.  This is for

you and me.

GILLIS

I understand some rich guy bought

up all the tickets for a perfor-

mance at the Metropolitan and sat

there listening to La Traviata,

all by himself.  He was afraid of

catching cold.

NORMA

Hold me tighter.

GILLIS

Come midnight, how about blind-

folding the orchestra and smash-

ing champagne glasses on Max's

head?

NORMA

You think this is all very funny.

GILLIS

A little.

NORMA

Is it funny that I'm in love

with you?

GILLIS

What's that?

NORMA

I'm in love with you.  Don't you

know that? I've been in love

with you all along.

C-9     NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE

laugh about this.  Ridicu-

lous situation, wasn't it?

age ...  It got to be about

felt caught, like a cig-

arette in the prongs of

that contraption on her

finger.

NORMA.

What a wonderful next year it's

going to be.  What fun we're going

to have.  I'II fill the pool for

you.  Or I'll open my house in

Malibu, and you can have the whole

ocean.  Or I'll buy you a boat

and we'll sail to Hawaii.

GILLIS

Stop it.  You aren't going to buy

me anything more.

NORMA

Don't be silly.

(She reaches under a

pillow of the couch

and brings out a

leather box)

Here.  I was going to give it to

you at midniglht.

NORMA

Read what's inside.

GILLIS

What are the notes?

NORMA

"Mad about the boy."

GILLIS

Norma, I can't take it.  You've

bought me enough.

NORMA

Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer

than all this new Hollywood trash.

I've got a million dollars.

GILLIS

Keep it.

NORMA

I own three blocks downtown.

I have oil in Bakersfield --

pumping, pumping, pumping.

What's it for but to buy us

anything we want.

GILLIS

Cut out that us business.

NORMA

What's the matter with you?

GILLIS

What right do you have to take

me for granted?

NORMA

What right? Do you want me to

tell you?

GILLIS

Has it ever occurred that I may

have a life of my own? That there

may be some girl I'm crazy about?

NORMA

Who? Some car hop, or a dress

extra?

GILLIS

Why not? What I'm trying to say

is that I'm all wrong for you.

You want a Valentino -- somebody

with polo ponies -- a big shot --

NORMA

What you're trying to say is

that you don't want me to love

you.  Is that it?

Hi, Artie.

Where have you been keeping that

gorgeous face of yours?

GILLIS

In a deep freeze.

ARTIE

I almost reported you to the Bureau

of Missing Persons.

(To the company)

Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the

well-known screen writer, opium

smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

ARTIE

Give me your coat.

GILLIS

Let it ride for a while.

ARTIE

You're going to stay, aren't you?

GILLIS

That was the general idea.

ARTIE

Come on.

ARTIE

What is this - mink?

ARTIE

Judas E. Priest, who did you

borrow that from? Adolphe

Menjou?

Close, but no cigar.

ARTIE

Say, you're not really smuggling

opium these days,  are you?

Where's the bar?

Good party.

The greatest.  They call me the Elsa

Maxwell of the assistant directors.

Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget

Fake the rest.

Listen, Artie, can I stick around

here for a while?

ARTIE

Sure, this'll go on all night.

I mean, could you put me up for

a couple of weeks?

ARTIE

It just so happens we have a

vacancy on the couch.

GILLIS

I'll take it.

ARTIE

I'll have the bell-hop take care

of your luggage.

Just register here.

BETTY

Hello, Mr.  Gillis.

ARTIE

You know each other?

BETTY

Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter,

Sheldrake's office.

GILLIS

Sure.  Bases Loaded.

ARTIE

Wait a minute.  This is the woman

I love.  What's going on? Who

was loaded?

GILLIS

Don't worry.  She's just a fan

for my literary output.

BETTY

(to Artie)

Hurt feelings department.

GILLIS

About that luggage.  Where's

the phone?

ARTIE

Over by the Rainbow Room.

GILLIS

When youlre through with that

thing, can I have it?

BETTY

You forgot this.

GILLIS

Thanks.

BETTY

I've been hoping to run into you.

GILLIS

What for? To recover that knife

you stuck in my back?

BETTY

I felt a little guilty, so I got

out some of your old stories.

GILLIS

Why, you sweet kid.

BETTY

There's one called....Window...

something with a window.

GILLIS

Dark Windows.  How did you

like it?

BETTY

I didn't.

GILLIS

Thank you.

BETTY

Except for about six pages.

You've got a flashback there ...

BETTY

Is there someplace we can talk?

GILLIS

How about the Rainbow Room?

ARTIE

I said you could have my couch.

I didn't say you could have my

girl.

BETTY

This is shop talk.

C-20    ARTIE'S BATHROOM

GILLIS

Now if I got you correctly, there

was a short stretch of my fiction

you found worthy of notice.

BETTY

The flashback in the courtroom,

when she tells about being a

school teacher.

GILLIS

I had a teacher like that once.

BETTY

Maybe that's why it's good.

It's true, it's moving.  Now

why don't you use that character...

GILLIS

Who wants true? Who wants moving?

BETTY

Drop that attitude.  Here's some-

thing really worth while.

GILLIS

Want me to start right now?

Maybe there's some paper around.

BETTY

I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

GILLIS

I've got some ideas myself.  One

of them being this is New Year's

Eve.  How about living it up a

little?

BETTY

As for instance?

GILLIS

Well....

BETTY

We could make some paper boats

and have a regatta.  Or should

we just turn on the shower?

GILLIS

How about capturing the kitchen

and barricading the door?

BETTY

Are you hungry?

GILLIS

Hungry? After twelve years in

the Burmese jungle.  I am starving,

Lady Agatha -- starving for a

white shoulder --

BETTY

Phillip, you're mad!

You can have the phone now.

Thirsting for the coolness of

your lips -

BETTY

No, Phillip, no.  We must be

strong.  You're still wearing

the uniform of the Coldstream

Guards!  Furthermore, you can

have the phone now.

GILLIS

O.K.

out, turns)

I find I'm terribly afraid of

losing you.

BETTY

You won't.

out of his hand)

take the script over to Paramount

Yes, Madame.

You're really going to send it

to De Mille?

This is the right day.

NORMA (Cont'd)

The chart from my astrologer.

She read deMille's horoscope.

She read mine.

GILLIS

Did she read the script?

NORMA

DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio.

Mars has been transmitting

Jupiter for weeks.  Today is

the day of greatest conjuction.

Now turn around.  Let me dry

you.

GILLIS

I hope you realize, Norma,

that scripts don't sell on

astrologers' charts.

NORMA

I'm not just selling the script.

I'm selling me.  DeMille always

said I was his greatest star.

GILLIS

When did he say it, Norma?

NORMA

So he said it quite a few years

ago.  So what?  I never looked

better in my life.  Do you know

why?  Because I've never been as

happy in my life.

You don't know how glad I am

Walking out on the mob.  What's

the big idea?

GILLIS

I'm sorry about New Year's. Would

you believe me if I said I had

to be with a sick friend?

ARTIE

Someone in the formal set, no

doubt, with a ten-carat kidney

stone.

BETTY

Stop it, Artie, will you?

(To Gillis)

Where have you been keeping your-

self? I've got the most wonderful

news for you.

GILLIS

I haven't been keeping myself at

all.  Not lately.

BETTY

I called your agent.  I called the

Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your

old apartment gave me some Crestview

number.  There was always somebody

with an accent growling at me.  You

were not there.  You were not to be

spoken to.  They never heard of you.

GILLIS

Is that so? What's the wonderful

news?

BETTY

Sheldrake likes that angle about

the teacher.

GILLIS

What teacher?

BETTY

Dark Windows.  I got him all

hopped up about it.

GILLIS

You did?

BETTY

He thinks it could be made into

something.

GILLIS

Into what? A lampshade?

BETTY

Into something for Barbara Stan-

wyck.  They have a commitment with

Barbara Stanwyck.

ARTIE

Unless you'd rather have Sarah

Bernhardt.

BETTY

This is on the level.  Sheldrake

really went for it.

GILLIS

O.K.  Where's the cash?

BETTY

Where's the story? I bluffed it

out with a few notions of my own.

It's really just a springboard.

It needs work.

GILLIS

I was afraid of that.

BETTY

I've got twenty pages of notes.

I've got a pretty good character

for the man.

ARTIE

Could you write in plenty of back-

ground action, so they'll need an

extra assistant director?

BETTY

Shut up, Artie.

(To Gillis)

Now if we could sit down for two

weeks and get a story.

GILLIS

Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've

given up writing on spec.

BETTY

I tell you this is half sold.

GILLIS

As a matter of fact.  I've given

up writing altogether.

MAX

Mr. Gillis, if you please.

GILLIS

Right with you.

The accent! I've got it: this guy

is in the pay of a foreign government.

Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.

GILLIS

I've got to run along.  Thanks any-

way for your interest in my career.

BETTY

It's not your career -- it's mine.

I kind of hoped to get in on this

deal.  I don't want to be a reader

all my life.  I want to write.

GILLIS

Sorry if I crossed you up.

Now, now do you belive me? I told

you deMille would jump at it.

MAX

It is not Mr. deMille in person.

It is someone by the name or Gordon

Cole.  He says it's very important.

NORMA

Certainly it's important.  It's

important enough for Mr. deMille

to call me personally.  The idea

of having an assistant call me!

MAX

I myself was surprised at Mr. de

Mille's manners.

NORMA

Say that I'm busy, and hang up.

MAX

Very good, Madam.

NORMA

How do you like that? We've

made twelve pictures together.

His greatest successes.

Maybe deMille is shooting.

belittle me.  He's trying to get

Of course you didn't.  You didn't

(taking Gillis's hand)

Don't you want to come along,

darling?

GILLIS

I don't think so.  It's your

script.  It's your show.

Good luck.

NORMA

Thank you, darling.

D-12    THE DOOR OF STAGE 18

DE MILLE

Hello, young fellow.

NORMA

Hello, Mr. deMille.

NORMA

Last time I saw you was someplace

very gay.  I remember waving to you.

I was dancing on a table.

DE MILLE

Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had

just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

D-13    STAGE 18

DE MILLE

Norma, I want to apologize for

not calling you.

NORMA

You'd better.  I'm very angry.

DE MILLE

I'm pretty busy, as you can see...

NORMA

That's no excuse.  You read the

script, didn't you?

DE MILLE

Yes, I did.

NORMA

Then you could have picked up the

phone yourself instead of leaving

it to one of your assistants.

DE MILLE

What assistant?

NORMA

Don't play innocent.  Somebody

named Gordon Cole.

DE MILLE

Gordon Cole?

NORMA

And if you hadn't been pretty

darned interested in that script,

he wouldn't have tried to get

me on the phone ten times.

DE MILLE

Gordon Cole... Look, Norma,

I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

(Indicating his

own chair)

Make yourself comfortable.

DE MILLE

(Sotto voce, to his

first assistant)

Get me Gordon Cole on the phone.

A VOICE

Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!

VOICE

Up here!

ELECTRICIAN

It's met It's Hog-eyel

NORMA

Hello.

HOG-EYE

Let's get a look at you.

EXTRAS

Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!

HAIRDRESSER

Hello, Miss Desmond.  It's Bessie.

D-14    ANOTHER PART OF THE STAGE

DE MILLE

Hello.

D-15    GORDON COLE'S OFFICE IN THE PROPERTY DEPARTMENT,

COLE

Prop Department.  Gordon Cole speaking.

D-16    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

DE MILLE

Cole, this is C. B. deMille.  Have

you been calling Norma Desmond?...

What's it about?

D-17    GORDON COLE, ON THE PHONE

COLE

It's that car of hers -- an old

Isotta-Fraschini.  Her chauffeur

drove it on the lot the other day.

It looks just right for the Crosby

picture.  We want to rent it for a

couple of weeks.

D-18    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

DE MILLE

(Troubled)

Oh.  Well, thank you.

DE MILLE

Well, Norma ...

(He sits down next to her)

I got hold of Gordon Cole.

NORMA

Did you see them? Did you see

how they came?

DE MILLE

You know, crazy things happen in

this business.  I hope you haven't

lost your sense of humor ...

DEMILLE

What's the matter, Norma?

NORMA

Nothing.  I just didn't realize

what it would be like to come back

to the old studio.  I had no idea

how I'd missed it.

DEMILLE

We've missed you too, dear.

NORMA

We'll be working again, won't we, Chief?

We'll make our greatest picture.

DEMILLE

That's what I want to talk to you about.

NORMA

It's a good script, isn't it?

DEMILLE

It's got a lot of good things.  Of

course, it would be an expensive picture...

NORMA

I don't care about the money.

I just want to work again.  You

don't know what it means to know

that you want me.

DEMILLE

Nothing would thrill me more --

if it were possible.

NORMA

But remember, darling -- I don't

work before ten in the morning,

and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

1ST ASSISTANT

We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.

DEMILLE

You'll pardon me, Norma? Why

don't you just sit and watch?

(He steps onto the set)

O.K.  Here we go.

1ST ASSISTANT

Roll 'em.

DEMILLE

Action!

D-19    THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE STAGE 18

MAX

(Pointing to the row

of offices in the

building opposite)

You see those offices there, Mr.

Gillis? They used to be her

dressing room, The whole row.

GILLIS

That didn't leave much for Wallace

Reid.

MAX

He had a great big bungalow on

wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See

where it says 'Readers' Department'?

I remember my walls were covered

with black patent leather...

GILLIS

I'll be with you in a minute.

1ST PROP MAN

Hey, that's the comic car Cole

was talking about!

(To Max)

Do you mind if we look inside?

MAX

Go away.  Go away.

D-2O    CUBICLE IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT

GILLIS

Just so you don't think I'm a

complete swine -- if there's

anything in Dark Windows you

can use, take it.  It's all

yours.

BETTY

Well, for heaven's sake!

BETTY

Have a chair.

GILLIS

I mean it.  It's no good to me

anyway.  Help yourself.

BETTY

Why should you do that?

GILLIS

If you get a hundred thousand for

it, you buy me a box of chocolate

creams.  If you get an Oscar, I

get the left foot.

BETTY

You know, I'd take you up on that

in a minute.  I'm just not good

enough to do it all by myself.

GILLIS

What about all those ideas you had?

BETTY

See if they make sense.  To begin

with, I think you should throw out

all that psychological stuff --

exploring a killer's sick mind.

GILLIS

Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

BETTY

This story is about teachers --

their threadbare lives, their

struggles.  Here are people doing

the most important job in the

world, and they have to wprry

about getting enough money to

re-sole their shoes.  To me it

can be as exciting as any chase,

any gunplay.

GILLIS

Check.

BETTY

Now I see her teaching day classes

while he teaches night school.  The

first time they meet ...

GILLIS

Look, if you don't mind, I haven't

got time to listen to the whole

plot ...

BETTY

I'll make it short.

GILLIS

Sorry.  It's your baby now.

BETTY

I'm not good enough to write it

alone.  We'll have to do it together.

GILLIS

I'm all tied up.  I can't.

BETTY

Couldn't we work in the evenings?

Six o'clock in the morning? This

next month I'm completely at your

disposal.  Artie is out of town.

GILLIS

What has Artie to do with it.

BETTY

We're engaged.

GILLIS

Good for you.  You've got yourself

the best guy in town.

BETTY

I think so.  They're on location

in Arizona, shooting a Western.

I'm free every evening, every week-

end.  If you want, we could work at

your place.

GILLIS

It's just impossible.

BETTY

Nobody can be that busy.

GILLIS

Look, Betty, It can't be done.

It's out.

BETTY

You're tough, all right.

GILLIS

You're on your own.  Stop being

chicken-hearted and write that story.

BETTY

Honest to goodness, I hate you.

GILLIS

(Turning 1n the open door)

And don't make it too dreary.  How

about this for a situation: she

teaches daytimes.  He teaches at

night.  Right?  They don't even know

each other, but they share the same

room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a

matter of fact, they sleep in the

same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

BETTY

Are you kidding? Because I think

it's good.

GILLIS

So do I.

BETTY

Came  on back.  Let me show you

where it fits in.

GILLIS

(At the door)

So long.

BETTY

Oh, you --

GILLIS

And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR

THE TEACHER.

D-21    STAIRCASE OUTSIDE READERS' DEPARTMENT

GILLIS

What's the matter, Max?

MAX

I just found out why all those tele-

phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond

they want.  It is the car they want

to rent.

GILLIS

What?

MAX

Ssh...

D-22    ENTRANCE TO STAGE 18

DE MILLE

Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see

what we can do.

NORMA

(embracing him)

I'm not worried.  Everything will

be fine.  The old team together.

Nothing can stop us.

DE MILLE

Get Gordon Cole.  Tell him to forget

about her car.  He can find another

old car.  I'll buy him five old cars,

if necessary.

1ST ASSISTANT

Yes, Mr. De Mille.

D-23    THE ISOTTA

GILLIS

(Apprehensively)

How did it go?

NORMA

It couldn't have gone better.

It's practically set.  Of course,

he has to finish this picture

first, but mine will be his next.

GILLIS

He must be quite a guy.

NORMA

He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can

smell box office.  Only I'm going

to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't

going to be C. B. deMille's Salome.

It's going to be Norma Desmond's

Salome, a Norma Desmond Production,

starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

MAX

Yes, Miss Desmond.

GILLIS

Yes, Norma.

NORMA

Don't turn around.  Keep your

eyes on the book.

GILLIS

Yes, Norma.

NORMA

I just came to say good night.

I don't want you to see me --

I'm not very attractive.

GILLIS

Good night.

NORMA

I've lost half a pound since

Tuesday.

GILLIS

Good.

NORMA

I was a little worried about the

line of my throat.  This woman

has done wonders with it.

GILLIS

Good.

NORMA

You'd better get to bed yourself.

GILLIS

I think I'll read a little.

NORMA

You went out last night, didn't

you, Joe?

GILLIS

Why do you say that?

NORMA

I just happen to know it.  I had

a nightmare and I screamed for

you.  You weren't here.  Where

were you?

GILLIS

I went for a walk.

NORMA

No you didn't.  You took the

car.

GILLIS

All right, I drove to the beach.

Norma, you don't want me to feel

I'm locked up in this house?

NORMA

Of course not, Joe.  It's just

that I don't want to be left alone.

Not now, while I'm under this

terrible strain.  My nerves are

being torn apart.  All I ask is

for you to be a little patient and a

little kind.

GILLIS

I haven't done anything, Norma.

NORMA

Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't

let you.

NORMA

Good night, my darling.

since they got to Arizona.  They

re-wrote the whole picture for

rain and shot half of it.  Now

the sun is out.  Nobody knows

when they'll get back.

GILLIS

Good.

BETTY

What's good about it?  I miss

him something fierce.

GILLIS

I mean this is good dialogue

along in here.  It'll play.

BETTY

It will?

GILLIS

Sure.  Especially with lots

of music underneath, drowning

it out.

BETTY

Don't you sometimes hate yourself?

GILLIS

Constantly.  No, in all serious-

ness, it's really good.  It's

fun writing again.  I'm happy

here, honest I am.

MAD ABOUT THE BOY --

Norma

BETTY

Who's Norma?

GILLIS

Who's who?

BETTY

I'm sorry.  I don't usually

read private cigarette cases.

GILLIS

Oh, that.  It's from a friend

of mine.  A middle-aged lady,

very foolish and very generous.

BETTY

I'll say.  This is solid gold.

GILLIS

I gave her some advice on an

idiotic script.

BETTY

It's that old familiar story,

you help a timid little soul

across a crowded street.  She

turns out to be a multimillionaire

and leaves you all her money.

GILLIS

That's the trouble with you

readers.  You know all the plots.

Now suppose you proof-read page

ten while the water boils.

E-11    AN EMPTY STREET AT THE                GILLIS' VOICE

stuck we'd make a

matter of fact, it was

when she first told me

about her nose ...

E-12    PARAMOUNT'S NEW YORK STREET (NIGHT)

BETTY

Look at this street.  All card-

board, all hollow, all phoney.

All done with mirrors.  I like

it better than any street in the

world.  Maybe because I used to

play here when I was a kid.

GILLIS

What were you -- a child actress?

BETTY

I was born just two blocks from

this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove

Avenue.  Father was head elec-

trician here till he died.  Mother

still works in Wardrobe.

GILLIS

Second generation, huh?

BETTY

Third.  Grandma did stunt work

for Pearl White.  I come from a

picture family.  Naturally they

took it for granted I was to become

a great star.  So I had ten years of

dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.

Then the studio made a test.  Well,

they didn't like my nose -- it slanted

this way a little.  I went to a doctor

and had it fixed.  They made more

tests, and they were crazy about my

nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

GILLIS

(Examining her nose

by the flame of his

lighter)

Nice job.

BETTY

Should be.  It cost three hundred

dollars.

GILLIS

Saddest thing I ever heard.

BETTY

Not at all.  It taught me a little

sense.  I got me a job in the mail

room, worked up to the Stenographic.

Now I'm a reader...

GILLIS

Come clean, Betty.  At night you

weep for those lost closeups, those

gala openings...

BETTY

Not once.  What's wrong with being

on the other side of the cameras?

It's really more fun.

GILLIS

Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!

I will now kiss that nose of yours.

BETTY

If you please.

GILLIS

May I say you smell real special.

BETTY

It must be my new shampoo.

GILLIS

That's no shampoo.  It'smore like

a pile of freehly laundred hand-

kerchiefs, like a brand new auto-

mobile.  How old are you anyway?

BETTY

Twenty-two.

GILLIS

That's it -- there's nothing like

being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest

that if we're ever to finish this

story you keep at least two feet

away from me ...  Now back to the

typewriter.

E-13    THE GARAGE

GILLIS

What is it, Max? Want to wash

the car, or are you doing a little

spying in your off hours?

MAX

You must be very careful as you

cross the patio.  Madame may be

watching.

GILLIS

How about my going up the kitchen

stairs and undressing in the dark.

Will that do it?

MAX

I'm not inquiring where Mr.

Gillis goes every night...

GILLIS

Why don't you? I'm writing a

script and I'm dying to finish

it, no matter what.

MAX

It's just that I'm very worried

about Madame.

GILLIS

Sure you are.  And we're not help-

ing her any, feeding her lies and

more lies.  Getting herself ready

for a pioture ...  What happens when

she finds out?

MAX

She never will.  That is my job.

It has been for a long time.  You

must understand I discovered her

when she was eighteen.  I made her

a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.

GILLIS

You made her a star?

MAX

I directed all her early pictures.

There were three young directors

who showed promise in those days:

D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and

Max von Mayerling.

GILLIS

And she's turned you into a

servant.

MAX

It was I who asked to come back,

humiliating as it may seem.  I

could have gone on witn my career,

only I found everything unendur-

able arter she divorced me.  You

see, I was her rirst husband.

Hey, what's the matter...

Betty, wake up!

(He whistles and

catches her attention)

Why are you staring at me like that?

BETTY

Was I?  I'm sorry.

GILLIS

What's wrong with you tonight?

What is it, Betty?

BETTY

Something came up.  I don't want

to talk about it.

GILLIS

Why not?

BETTY

I just don't.

GILLIS

What is it you've heard.  Come

on, let's have it.

GILLIS

Is it about me?

E-18    THE BALCONY

GILLIS

Betty, there's no use running

out on it.  Let's face it, what-

ever it is.

BETTY

It's nothing.  I got a telegram

from Artie.

GILLIS

From Artie.  What's wrong?

BETTY

He wants me to come on to Arizona.

He says it only oosts two dollars

to get married there.  It would

kind of save us a honeymoon.

GILLIS

Why don't you? We can finish the

script by Thursday.

GILLIS

Stop crying.  You're getting

married.  That's what you've

always wanted.

BETTY

I don't want it now.

GILLIS

Why not? Don't you love Artie?

BETTY

Of course I love him.  I always

will.  I'm just not in love

with him any more.

GILLIS

What happened?

BETTY

You did.

about.  Maybe I'd never

have to.  Maybe I could

I could wipe the whole

woman again.

(Taking the phone)

This is Betty Schaefer.

E-23    NORMA AT IHE PHONE

NORMA

Miss Schaefer, you must forgive

me for calling you so late, but

I really feel it's my duty.  It's

about Mr. Gillis.  You do know Mr.

Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you

know about him? Do you know where

he lives? Do you know how he lives?

Do you know what he lives on?

E-24    BETTY AT THE PHONE

BETTY

Who are you? What do you want?

What business is it of yours

anyway?

E-25    NORMA ON THE PHONE

NORMA

Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do

you a favor.  I'm trying to spare

you a great deal of misery.  Of

course you may be too young to even

suspect there are men of his sort...

NORMA (Cont'd)

I don't know what he's told you, but

he does not live with relatives, nor

with friends, in the usual sense of

the word.  Ask him ... Ask him again.

GILLIS

(Into phone)

That's right, Betty, ask me again.

This is Joe.

E-26    BETTY ON THE PHONE

BETTY

Joe, where are you? What's this

all about?

E-27    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

GILLIS

Or maybe it would be a better

idea if you came over and saw it

for yourself.  The address is 10086

.

NORMA

Don't hate me, Joe.  I did it because

I need you.  I need you as I never

needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my

hands, look at my face, look under my

eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm

wasting away under this torment? You

don't know what I've been through these

last weeks.  I got myself a revolver.

You don't believe me, but I did, I did!

I stood in front of that mirror, only

I couldn't make myself.  It wouldn't be

NORMA (Cont'd)

fair to all those people who are

waiting to see me back on the

screen.  I can't disappoint them.

Only, if I'm to work, I need

sleep, I need quiet, I need you!

Don't just stand there hating

me! Shout at me, strike me!

But don't hate me, Joe.  Don't

you hear me, Joe?

GILLIS

Yes, I hear you.  And I wish you'd

keep still so I can hear the doorbell

when she rings it.

It's all right, Max.  I'll take it.

MAX

Yes, sir.

GILLIS

Hello, Betty.

BETTY

(On the threshold)

I don't know why I'm so scared,

Joe.  Is it something awful?

GILLIS

Come on in, Betty,

GILLIS

Ever been in one of these old

Hollywood palazzos? That's from

when they were making eighteen thou-

sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful

of these tiles, they're slippery.

Valentino used to dance here.

BETTY

This is where you live?

GILLIS

You bet.

BETTY

Whose house is it?

E-32    THE LIVING ROOM

GILLIS

Hers.

BETTY

Whose?

GILLIS

Just look around.  There's a lot

of her spread about.  If you don't

remember the face, you must have

heard the name of Norma Desmond.

BETTY

That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

GILLIS

Want something to drink?  There's

always champagne on ice, and plenty

of caviar.

BETTY

Why did she call me?

GILLIS

Jealous.  Ever see so much junk?

She had the ceiling brought from

Portugal.  Look at this.

GILLIS

Her own movie theatre.

BETTY

I didn't come here to see a house.

What about Norma Desmond?

GILLIS

I'm trying to tell you.  This is

an enormous place.  Eight master

bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every

bathroom.  There's a bowling alley

in the cellar.  It's lonely here,

so she got herself a companion.

A very simple set-up: An older

woman who is well-to-do.  A younger

man who is not doing too well ...

Can you figure it out yourself?

BETTY

No.

GILLIS

All right.  I'll give you a few

more clues.

BETTY

No, no! I haven't heard any of

this.  I never got those telephone

calls.  I've never been in this

house ... Get your things together.

Let's get out of here.

GILLIS

All my things? All the eighteen

suits, all the custom-made shoes and

the eighteen dozen shirts, and the

cuff-links and the platinum key-

chains, and the cigarette cases?

BETTY

Come on, Joe.

GILLIS

Come on where? Back to a one-room

apartment that I can't pay for?

Back to a story that may sell and

very possibly will not?

BETTY

If you love me, Joe.

GILLIS

Look, sweetie -- be practical.

l've got a good thing here.

A long-term contract with no options.

I like it that way.  Maybe it's not

very admirable.  Well, you and Artie

can be admirable.

BETTY

Joe, I can't look at you any more.

GILLIS

Nobody asked you to.

GILLIS

All right, baby.  This way out.

E-33    UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE

What are you doing, Joe?  What

are you doing?  You're not leaving

me?

GILLIS

Yes, I am, Norma.

NORMA

No, you're not.

(Calling)

Max! Max!

GILLIS

Max is a good idea.  He can help

with my luggage.

(He gestures in the

direction of the closet)

Thanks for letting me wear the

handsome wardrobe.  And thanks

for the use of all the trinkets.

GILLIS

(Indicating the bureau)

The rest of the jewelry is in the

top drawer.

NORMA

It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to

you.

GILLIS

And I'd take it in a second, Norma --

only it's a little too dressy for

sitting behind the copy desk in

Dayton, Ohio.

NORMA

These are nothing.  You can have

anything you want if you'll only

stay.  What is it you want --

money?

GILLIS

Norma, you'd be throwing it away.

I don't qualify for the job, not any

more.

NORMA

You can't do this!  Max!  Max!

... I can't face life without you,

and I'm not afraid to die, you

know.

GILLIS

That's between you and yourself,

Norma.

NORMA

You think I made that up about

the gun...

NORMA

See, you didn't believe me!..

Now I suppose you don't think I

have the courage!

GILLIS

Oh.  sure -- if it would make a

good scene.

NORMA

You don't care.  do you?  But

hundreds of thousands of people

will carel

GILLIS

Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing

yourself to an empty house.  The

audience left twenty years ago.

Now face it.

NORMA

That's a lie!  They still want me!

GILLIS

No, they don't.

NORMA

What about the studio?

What about De Mille?

GILLIS

He was trying to spare your feelings.

The studio wanted to rent your car.

NORMA

Wanted what?

GILLIS

De Mille didn't have the heart

to tell you.  None of us has had

the heart.

NORMA

That's a lie!  They want me, they

want me!  I get letters every day!

GILLIS

You tell her, Max.  Come on, do

her that favor.  Tell her there

isn't going to be any picture --

there aren't any fan letters,

except the ones you write yourself.

NORMA

That isn't true! Max?

MAX

Madame is the greatest star of

them all...  I will take Mr.

Gillis' bags.

NORMA

You heard him.  I'm a star!

GILLIS

Norma, grow up.  You're a woman

of fifty.  There's nothing tragic

about being fifty - not unless

you try to be twenty-five.

NORMA

I'm the greatest star of them

all.

GILLIS

Goodbye.  Norma.

NORMA

No one leaves a star.  That

makes one a star.

NORMA

You're not leaving me!

E-40    STAIRCASE

NORMA'S VOICE

Joe! ...Joe!

NORMA

You're not leaving me!

E-41    PATIO (NIGHT)

NORMA

You're not leaving me!

NORMA

Stars are ageless, aren't they?

E-42    THE PATIO

E-43    THE LOWER HALL, DESMOND HOUSE

LIEUTENANT

Coroner's office? ... I want to

speak to the Coroner ... Who's

on this phone?

E-44    THE WHITE TELEPHONE IN NORMA'S BEDROOM

MISS HOPPER

I am! Now get off, this is more

important ... Times City Desk?

Hedda Hopper speaking.  I'm talking

from the bedroom of Norma Desmond.

Don't bother with a rewrite man, take

this direct.  Ready? -- As day breaks

over the murder house, Norma Desmond,

famed star of yesteryear, is in

a state of complete mental shock ...

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

You do not deny having killed

this man, Miss Desmond?

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Did you intend to kill him?

Just answer me that.

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there

been any trouble between you before?

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

If it was a quarrel, how come you

had the gun right there?

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

This guy -- where did you meet him

for the first time?  Where did he

come from? Who is he?

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Did he have a wife?  Did he had a

girl friend?  Did you know them?

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

Had he been trying to blackmail you?

E-45    PATIO - (DAWN)                     GILLIS' VOICE

the damage, just for the record

... By this time the whole joint

was jumping -- cops,reporters,

neighbors, passersby -- as much

hoopdedoo as we get in Los

Angeles when they open a Super

Market.  Even the newsreel guys

came roaring in.  Here was an

item everybody could have some

fun with, the heartless so-and-

so's.  What would they do to her?

Even if she got away with it in

court- crime of passion - tempo-

rary insanity - those headlines

would kill her: Forgotten Star

a Slayer--Aging Actress--

Yesterday's Glamour Queen...

E-46    NORMA'S BEDROOM

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Did the deceased ever threaten you?

Were you in fear of bodily injury?

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought

of doing something like this before?

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Was theft involved?  Did you catch

him trying to steal something, or

find he had stolen something?

LIEUTENANT

The newsreel guys have arrived with

the cameras.

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Tell them to go fly a kite.  This

is no time for cameras.

NORMA

Cameras? ...What is it, Max?

MAX

The cameras have arrived, Madame.

NORMA

They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell

Mr. DeMille I will be on the set

at once.

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

What is this?

MAX

Please ...

HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN

(sotto voce, to Head of Homicide)

Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

HEAD OF HOMICIDE

Okay.  And let's have the car right

outside.

7-1                       NORMA

You will pardon me, gentlemen.

I have to get ready for my scene.

E-47    STAIRCASE AND LOWER HALL

MAX

Is everything set up, gentlemen?

Are the lights ready?

MAX

Is everything set up, gentlemen?

CAMERAMAN

Just about.

MAX

Are the lights ready?

2ND CAMERA MAN

All set.

MAX

Quiet, everybody!  Lights!

Are you ready, Norma?

NORMA

(From the top of the

stairs)

What is the scene? Where am I?

MAX

This is the staircase of the palace.

NORMA

Oh, yes, yes.  They're below,

waiting for the Princess ...

I'm ready.

MAX

All right.

(To cameramen)

Camera!

(To Norma)

Action!

had taken pity on Norma

Desmond.  The dream she

had clung to so des-

perately had enfolded

her...

NORMA

I can't go on with the scene.

I'm too happy.  Do you mind,

Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words?

Thank you.  I just want to tell

you how happy I am to be back in

the studio making a picture again.

You don't know how much I've missed

all of you.  And I promise you

I'll never desert you again, because

after "Salome" we'll make another

picture, and another and another.

You see, this is my life.  It always

will be.  There's nothing else -

just us and the cameras and those

wonderful people out there in the

dark...  All right, Mr. DeMille,

I'm ready for my closeup.

THE END
