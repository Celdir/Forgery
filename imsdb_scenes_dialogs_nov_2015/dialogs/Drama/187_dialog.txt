1   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1

RUSH HOUR

ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently

pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now

to meet the bicyclist...

He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears

wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased

slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at

once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass

on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.

ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade

bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind

him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.

Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.

above the East River.

A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks

back and forth as he pumps the pedals.

FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the

bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour

traffic on the bridge below.

2   EXT. ATLANTIC AVENUE (BEDFORD STUYVESANT) - MORNING         2

A wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes

as an "EL" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel

with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes

more and more rundown.

3   EXT. ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL (BEDFORD                 3

STUYVESANT) - MORNING

A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old

three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray

patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most

recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a

black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who

are about to be tardy...

ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL

(clapping his hands)

... Let's go, people! Tardy lock-

out starts in one minute! Get

your butts in gear! One minute,

people! Move it!

VOICE IN CROWD

... Yuh late, Garfield.

TREVOR

(catching his breath)

... No, bell hasn't rung yet.

Okay, let's get inside. C'mon.

(as they file

into the room)

... Morning, morning. Rise and

shine.

AUGGIE

(shaking his head)

... You one crazy-ass nigga, G.

TYWAN

(a quarter stuck

in one ear)

... Damn skippy.

TREVOR

Thank you for sharing, Auggie.

TYWAN

(provoking Auggie)

... Auggie doggie.

AUGGIE (O.S.)

Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a

gangsta-rapper.

TREVOR

'Scuse me, you two... this isn't

the Playboy Channel.

TREVOR

'Morning, Juanita.

TREVOR

(enthusiastically)

Let's get started. August and

Tywan, you pass out the books.

Thank you, gentlemen.

Auggie and Tywan don't budge.

TYWAN

Whas up wit' your car, G?   Yer

Pinto blow up?

The majority of students aren't even paying attention.          A

group in the back is already starting a card game.

TREVOR

(good-natured smile)

No, I don't own a Pinto, Tywan.

(addressing the class)

Okay, can I have everyone's

attention?

No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor.         He removes

the front wheels from his bike.

TREVOR

The purpose of the bicycle is to

demonstrate the principle of

centripetal force. That's the

opposite of the force we studied

yesterday, which was...

VOICE IN THE CROWD

Magnum force.

Hoots and laughter.

TREVOR

Centrifugal force... Centripetal

force is where the acceleration of

a body moving in circular motion

is directed toward its center by an

opposing force, thus creating

momentum that constrains the body to

its circular path. Like a gyroscope.

(sees nothing

but yawns)

It's better if I show you. Here,

Tywan, you be my helper.

Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner.        They

still haven't passed out the books.

(CONTINUED)

TREVOR

Tywan?   Come on.

Tywan, solidly built like a Rodin bronze, saunters over.

TYWAN

Whad-up, G?

(to rest of class)

Hey, shut up! Y'all too damn

loud, man!

Class quiets but only marginally.

TREVOR

I need you to demonstrate

centripetal force.

(removes briefcase

from stool)

Here, have a seat.

Tywan sits and Trevor hands him the upside-down bicycle.

TREVOR

Okay, hold the bike steady with

your knees. That's it. Seat

positioned against your chest.

Tywan glances over at Auggie and starts to laugh.

TYWAN

(to Auggie)

Shut up, foo.

TREVOR

Okay, now crank the pedals and get

that back wheel spinning about

180 R.P.M.

TYWAN

Whas up wit' dat?

TREVOR

(coaxing him along)

You'll see. Be patient.

A skeptical Tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's

not pedaling hard enough.

TREVOR

... Put some muscle into it.

Tywan cranks the pedals harder now. Trevor back-pedals

over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a

physical science book (but doesn't open it).

(CONTINUED)

1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                6.

8   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            8

TREVOR

... Keep pedaling. Harder.

A paper airplane sails past an oblivious Tywan. He

cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice.

Now, he impales Trevor with a befuddled squint.

TYWAN

(incredulous)

Whas up? I tol' you you was

crazy, man.

A thin smile of confidence from Trevor now...

TREVOR

Now tilt the wheel to your right.

Tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the

right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis.

TYWAN

(eyes wide like

a little kid)

Aw, damn. I'm spinnin'.   Lookit

me, Auggie!

Trevor flickers a smile as Tywan's spinning starts to

draw the attention of the rest of the class.

Now Trevor refers to the physical science book in his

hand. Smile on his face immediately fades.

INSERT: Physical science textbook. In magic marker.

The large number 187 has been scrawled across every

page. Trevor flips through the book. He checks the

front page to see who it belongs to.

Juxtaposed to Trevor's distracted state, the class is now

focused on Tywan's achievement...

CLASS

(attempting unison)

... Tywan, Tywan, Tywan.

9   INT. RWHS - "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - SECOND            9

PERIOD

One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. The

place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a

cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom. Now Trevor

heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the

corridor. He clutches the desecrated physical science

book. A student slides down the banister past him.

SECRETARY

Okay, fellas, off the table. Put

the Walkman away. I said put it

away...

TREVOR

Walter, I need to speak with you.

WALTER

(preoccupied)

I'm pretty busy right now,

Garfield. What is it?

TREVOR

Could you open it, please?

WALTER

(a weary look

of disgust)

Don't suppose this kid cares about

our budget crisis?

(shuts the book)

Have the textbook room charge him

for the book.

TREVOR

One-Eight-Seven is a penal code

number for murder, Walter.

Means the same thing as T-O-S.

'Terminate On the Spot.'

(CONTINUED)

WALTER

(piqued)

For chrissake, I know what it

stands for. Look, kid probably

heard it in a rap song. Doesn't

mean anything.

TREVOR

... The book belongs to Dennis

Broadway. He's a known gangster,

Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.'

WALTER

Garfield, if I had a dollar for

every time a student threatened

faculty... Don't you think you're

overreacting a little?

TREVOR

(suppressing

trepidation)

Did you tell Dennis Broadway he

was getting a fail from me?

WALTER

(stymied)

I have legal access to those

files.

TREVOR

He's a transfer from Nixon High

School, isn't he?

WALTER

(becoming defensive)

Look, I'm not obligated to track

you down every time a transfer

student comes through here. You

want confidential information

like that, come look it up in his

cum (cue-mm).

TREVOR

Do you have him on a contract?

WALTER

If he gets through the semester

without a fail then he gets to go

back to Nixon, so what?

TREVOR

... and be with his homeboys.

WALTER

So he blew his opportunity. Now

he has to learn to live with the

consequences.

TREVOR

I don't think this kid's ready to

deal with the consequences. I

think he wants me dead.

WALTER

Relax, has nothin' to do with you.

TREVOR

I should have been told, Walter.

WALTER

Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield,

but my hands are tied. Kid has a

right to his privacy... Know what

your problem is? You're an

idealist.

TREVOR

What's wrong with that?

WALTER

You only see what you wanna see,

that's what's wrong. On one hand

you think someone's trying to kill

you. On the other hand you

actually believe kids are paying

attention in your classes.

TREVOR

(collecting himself)

Never mind. It's not a problem.

WALTER

(an empty promise)

Tell you what, as soon as I get a

chance I'll summons the kid.

Promise.

17   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - TREVOR'S PRAYER - SERIES OF SHOTS         17

water.

shoes, a broad scar shows across the back of his hand.

C)   ANOTHER ANGLE

His pressed slacks and tie hang meticulously over a

chair as he gets dressed.

D)   CRUCIFIX

Now Jesus Christ looks down on Trevor from his crucifix

on the bedroom wall.

TREVOR (V.O.)

(kneeling bedside)

... If you're listening, God,

please help me today. All I ask

is a chance to do my job... t'do

the job you put me here to do in

the first place.

(prayerfully now)

Please help me accept those things

I cannot change... and give me

strength to change those things I

can.

(beat)

... This is me, Trevor, God.

Amen.

"A" BUILDING - MORNING

Traffic bottle-necks as students cross in front of cars,

and big yellow L.A.U.S.D. buses pull in. The green lawn

is scattered with students (about 65% Hispanic).

Compared to the scarred, institutional look of Roosevelt

Whitney, the face of John Quincy Adams is unblemished.

(This is your own backyard, not the inner city)

Sagging pants (Dickies, Ben Davis) and oversized jackets

(County Bens, Duke, Georgetown) are represented. The

different socio-economic and ethnic groups stick with

their own kind; the IHPs (Individual Honors Program), the

taggers, the Gangbangers, the Asians, the Armenians...

The point I'd like to make is

this... Anyone here can be a

scientist.

ASIAN GIRL

TREVOR

detective. He investigates data.

He scratches the surface of things

he doesn't understand to see

Farfie. Instead she wharked to

TREVOR

Okay, anyone know what Barsek just

said?

TREVOR

That's alright. You don't need to

understand something to answer a

few simple questions about it.

Every one of you is capable of

decoding data. Watch.

Why do you wear a rosary?

Jus' gimme a referral.    Shit.

TREVOR

For future reference, anyone who

disrupts a class, or in any way

infringes on the rights of others

to get an education, is subject to

disciplinary action.

When I'm here, ladies and

gentlemen, I expect to be treated

decently...

(walks back

... hopefully in an atmosphere of

mutual respect. This classroom is

our sanctuary, yours and mine.

Respect it.

For your information, I am a real

Trevor sits by himself, lost in stirring a bowl of soup.

He observes a talkative clique of teachers at the far end

of the table, including Teacher #1.

Now Dave Childress sits down, disrupting Trevor's

solitude.

CHILDRESS

How goes the battle, Garfield?

Dave bites into a messy sandwich as he skims the front

page of a newspaper that someone left behind.

CHILDRESS

D'juh get that binky marsden farfied?

Trevor doesn't say a word. Just keeps stirring his soup

... Now notices Ellen Henry as she enters and joins the

food line.

CHILDRESS

Know what I think? I think that

Chacon punk's the one who opened

your bungalow this morning.

(another bite)

Eskander doesn't know how to lock

a window.

TREVOR'S POV - ELLEN AND CASHIER

The cashier (Armenian girl, 15) is one of Ellen's

students. As Ellen pays for a sandwich...

ELLEN

... Come by the lab after school,

we'll work on it...

(as Trevor nods)

And don't look for support from

the administration. Most of 'em

haven't been in a classroom in ten

years. They don't know shit. I

got tenure and I'm still out here

in the damn bungalows. I should

be in the 'A' building with a nice

TREVOR

Actually, he survived.

No, it was on 'Sixty Minutes.' Some

ten-penny nail like a dozen times

in a hallway and...

you.

Trevor's comment)

So what'd they give the kid?

TREVOR

They put 'im upstate in a facility

CHILDRESS

That all? They shoulda caned the

bastard. Like they did that kid

in Singapore. Remember?

(recollecting)

President of Singapore had a few

choice words. Use to have it

memorized... He said something

like, 'When a state of increasing

disorder and defiance cannot be

checked by the rules... then new

and sometimes drastic rules have

to be forged to maintain order.'

(slides Trevor

a glance)

'The alternative is to surrender

order to chaos and anarchy.'

TREVOR

So why do you still teach?

Same reason as you, Garfield -- for

No thanks.

ELLEN

So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...

and if the district construes it

as assault and battery on a

student, she's gone.

In a heart beat. She's non-

tenured, they don't want to get

TREVOR

Because I flunked him.

ELLEN

When they say they wanna kill you,

you'd best take it serious. This

kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity

Transfer -- but nobody told me

until it was too late.

ELLEN

Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...

In less than a year he's been

convicted of felony assault and

suspended twice. I even testified

against him as a character witness.

Now I get to see him every day in

homeroom. I'm stuck with him.

Condition of his probation is

that he stay in school.

TREVOR

You talk to the principal?

ELLEN

Many times... Three weeks ago,

Garcia calls Benny's mother in for

a conference, but she refuses to

show up. She's afraid they'll

deport her because she's illegal.

So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and

some attorney tells her she

doesn't have to come in.

Garcia got cold feet and dropped

the whole thing.

'Young's rule...' Go on.

RITA

(reacting)

CESAR

Stoopit bitch.

TREVOR

Touch her again, Cesar, and you'll

answer to me personally.

CESAR

You like her, Mr. G?

RITA

(shrinking)

Shut up!

TREVOR

(genuinely)

Settle down, everyone. We all

have to learn how to forgive and

get along. C'mon, Cesar, read.

Please.

CESAR

TREVOR

chance. Whadda you say, Cesar?

TREVOR

Rita, would you please read Young's

rule for me?

RITA

(hesitates and...)

... 'Young's rule formulates

proper dosage levels for children

and adolescents.'

TREVOR

Thank you.

TREVOR

... In the brown bottle I have a

prescription for liquid Demeral.

STEVIE

Where'd that come from, sir?

TREVOR

A doctor.

TREVOR

Demeral is a morphine sulphate...

and is soluble in water.

TREVOR

Young's rule says, divide the age

of the patient by the patient's

age plus twelve, giving us the

fraction of the adult dosage

suitable for the patient.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

In Snowball's case, I've

calculated the dosage necessary

to tranquilize a one-year-old

child... then further divided

that fraction by 30, based on his

weight, to arrive at .002

milligrams.

TREVOR

TREVOR

Where's my watch?

CESAR

CESAR

Want me to break it down to you?

I gotta catch a bus.

TREVOR

Has nothing to do with you, Ellen.

It's... hard for me...

TREVOR

Pretty much been like that

since... you know, my accident.

Has nothing to do with you.

ELLEN

Is it because I'm white?

TREVOR

No.

ELLEN

We can still be friends.   Just don't

pull away.

ELLEN

(back to lighter note)

Now, can I ask you a favor? After

you're done with Hyland, can you

give me a ride to my car? It's at

the mechanics, about five or six

blocks up Lankershim. If you can't,

it's okay, I can walk.

TREVOR

59   INT. PRINCIPAL GARCIA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                      59

MR. GARCIA

You don't mind if I tape record

our conversation. Matter of

record. You understand.

(indicating

Mr. Hyland)

Of course, you know Mr. Hyland.

TREVOR

Am I being questioned?

MR. GARCIA

(beat)

Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Littleton tell

me you've accused them of stealing

your watch. If that's the case, I

need to address the accusation.

(CONTINUED)

59   CONTINUED:                                                       59

TREVOR

... For the record, I primarily

suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I

wouldn't be surprised if Stevie

was an accomplice.

(glances over at

Cesar and Stevie)

Beginning of sixth period, Cesar

admired the watch. I believe his

exact words were, 'Can I have it?'

(looks back to Garcia)

Either way, I'd like my watch back.

MR. GARCIA

Anything else?

TREVOR

When I asked him to empty his

pockets, Cesar refused.

MR. GARCIA

Is that true, Mr. Sanchez?

CESAR

No way. He never asked me nothin'

like that! I don't go 'round

taxing no teachers...

MR. GARCIA

Okay.   Calm down.

CESAR

... I ain't got no watch, man.

MR. GARCIA

Mr. Littleton, may we see your

pockets too?

TREVOR

(last try)

I'd like a locker search, please.

(CONTINUED)

59   CONTINUED:                                                      59

MR. GARCIA

You're excused, gentlemen.   Take

your things. Thank you.

MR. GARCIA

(unflinching pragmatism)

... Let me try and explain

something. I try and think of

our students here at John Quincy

Adams like they're my clients.

I can't accuse anybody just on

your hunches. I need more than

that. I need facts.

(looking at Hyland)

I won't have another law suit like

we did with that Blackwell case.

(now to Trevor)

Boy's mother spent $400 that she

couldn't afford on new clothes for

her son. Unfortunately we

considered the clothing gang

attire and sent the boy home.

That cost the district a quarter

of a million dollars.

(beat)

So I want you to be straight with

me, Mr. Garfield. Did you

physically see Cesar take your

watch?

TREVOR

No, I didn't...

MR. GARCIA

Do you have any witnesses who saw

him take it?

TREVOR

(pause)

... No.

MR. GARCIA

Unless there's reasonable cause to

show that Cesar, or Mr. Littleton

took your watch then I can't

authorize a locker search. I'm

sorry. Any concerns regarding my

decision, you can look up in the

handbook. It's section 628.1 of

the Education Code.

TREVOR

(to Garcia)

That was my grandfather's watch.

Can't you see what they're doing?

Weren't you ever a teacher?

MR. GARCIA

Afraid I never had the privilege.

Teaching and being a principal

don't necessarily go hand in hand,

Mr. Garfield.

Ellen awakens with a start.

She glances about, momentarily disoriented.      Now she

remembers where she is and what happened.

ELLEN

Trevor?

No response.    Choking back emotions.

101   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  101

As Ellen returns. She notices the glass of water on the

desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the

desk and sits down.

ELLEN

... Where'd you put the aspirin?

Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer

of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of

the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what

she sees...

... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters,

Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads.

BACK TO Ellen and her curious, sobered look.      Now she slowly

shuts the drawer.

103   INT. TREVOR'S FOYER - A SHORT WHILE LATER                          103

Eyes feverish, registering pain. His head throbs. He

begins to move and discovers a pounding in his right

hand...

... Lifting his hand up in front of his face.    Cesar's

ring index finger has been severed clean off.    Blood is

everywhere.

Cesar emotes a silent panic-stricken scream. Reduced to

a snot-sobbing wreck, he frantically searches the ground

on his hands and knees...

CESAR

My finger. Please, somebody help

me! Where's my finger?!

106   OMITTED                                                        106

Cesar now in a wheelchair, right hand completely wrapped

in gauze. He pleads with two police DETECTIVES...

CESAR

... I put it on my mother, sir.

DETECTIVE #1

(leaning forward;

good cop)

... So your science teacher shot

you with an arrow full of drugs

then chopped off your finger.

Come on, you can do better than

that, Cesar.

CESAR

It had to be him!

DETECTIVE #2

Pinche madre... he hates my guts,

Cuz, this circumstantial bullshit

won't hold up in court, I'll tell

you that right now.

Detective #1 refers to a rap sheet...

DETECTIVE #1

(sadly)

Caught too many priors, Cesar.

Juvenile GTA, vandalism...

CESAR

I know he did it! Don't you hear

what I'm saying?

DETECTIVE #1

You saw his face?

CESAR

(lying)

Yeah, yeah. I seen him.

Detective #2 shakes his head and grimaces.

DETECTIVE #2

Lemme save yuh from perjuring

yourself, asshole... You're full

of shit.

CESAR

I swear it!   For reals!

DETECTIVE #2

(turns to leave)

C'mon, this guy's wasting our time.

(points to Cesar)

Come up with something better than

that, or the truth, then maybe we'll

talk.

Detective #2 walks away.     Detective #1 follows.

Cesar hangs his head, mumbling a disparaging flood of

Spanish expletives...

... As the blurred shoulder of an orderly CROSSES OUT to

reveal a legal-sized white envelope now on the counter

top.

A busy E.R. nurse notices the envelope. Glances around.

Picks up the envelope and reads the name typed across the

face of it... CESAR SANCHEZ... narrowing her gaze as she

opens the envelope.

In the envelope, Cesar's severed finger, nesting in a

clump of newspaper.

Appears to be something tattooed across the side of it

but we can't quite make it out.

The Nurse gasps and drops the envelope, spilling the

finger onto the counter top.

CLOSE now ON the finger and the fresh "tatt" scrawled

across its side: R-U-DUN?

SOUND FADES now from the scene, replaced by a TECHNO HIP-

HOP TRACK that CONTINUES THROUGH the CUT...

HIP-HOP TRACK FADES now replaced by the buzz of

cross-talk. Trevor strolls the aisles, an open

science book in hand.

(NOTE: Rita is dressed in overalls, very subdued

compared to her usual attire.)

Cesar's back... and seated in his regular seat, across

from Stevie Littleton. Uncharacteristically, his eyes

are fixed on the book in front of him.

TREVOR

make up the human hand?

Trevor holds up his hand for display.

TREVOR

A reluctant cross section of hands go up.

has developed an odd sort of order to its madness.

Trevor looks around.      Picks on an Anglo girl in the second

row.

TREVOR

Christian.

CHRISTIAN

... The metacarpals.

TREVOR

The Metacarpals. That's one.

(to class)

Name some more?

Now he picks on Rita...

TREVOR

Rita.

RITA

The wrist... and thumb.

A flurry of thumbs go up as if on cue.

TREVOR

Good.

(holding up all his

fingers now)

... And don't forget the phalanges.

Fingers shoot up and wiggle on cue...

CLASS

(in unison)

Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges...

Scattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing

routine...

Cesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he

slides a look at the "R-U-DUN" tatt on his right index

finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on,

supported by a finger brace.

Stevie openly stares at the back of Trevor's head as

Trevor passes by in the aisle.

Hi.

TREVOR

Where'd you go the other night?

ELLEN

I was going to ask you the same

thing.

TREVOR

Wanna get some Chinese later?

There's a new place in the Valley

Center. 'Spose to be pretty good.

ELLEN

(an excuse)

... Can't tonight. Maybe another

time.

Weighs it, and...

TREVOR

(stands there for

a moment)

papers anyway. Some of these

bungalow kids actually care

about a grade. Even Cesar's doing

better. Today, for the first time

Before school tutoring session. The minute hand on the

wall clock jerks ahead one minute... 7:23 AM.

Trevor and Rita at a table near the back of the library.

Trevor gazes blankly at Rita's essay. Rita revises one

of the pages.

INTERCUT Dave Childress at the front counter as the

librarian (late fifties) photocopies a page from a

history book for him. Childress scrutinizes Trevor and

Rita as he waits.

Satisfied now, Rita slides the page to Trevor...

RITA

... Finished.

Trevor blinks himself back to reality...

TREVOR

... Let's hava look..

He adjusts his glasses.      Pores over the paper...

TREVOR

... Good.

(deliberating)

... I was just thinking, since

your essay's about gangs and

getting away from their influence,

you probably could've left some of

those double negatives you like so

well.

RITA

So now you wan' me to use bad

grammar.

(explaining)

Only if it suits your topic.

RITA

I know. We're all products of our

environment 'n' shit.

TREVOR

No, I think that's just an excuse.

(beat)

I say if we're strong, we can rise

above adversity.

(lets it sink in)

But it's like rap or hip-hop...

Correct all the grammar and it

loses its impact.

RITA

So you like hip-hop, Mr. G?

TREVOR

(shakes his head)

... I hate it.

RITA

(reacting)

What kinda black man are you?

Trevor bursts forth a laugh.

Childress perks up at the front counter.

Trevor's laugh evokes a smile from Rita.      Now she pries

a little further...

RITA

Why you here anyways? Don't you

got nothin' better t'do?

TREVOR

... Everything I wanna do is right

here.

(back on track now)

It's a good essay, Rita. You put

a lot of effort into it, it shows.

Comes from the heart, maestro.

TRACING jogging trail, KEEPING PACE now with a die-hard

runner. Something registers in the runner's eyes, pace

slowing, now stopping. Not fully comprehending what he

is looking at...

FOLLOWING HIS GAZE... THROUGH a curtain of rain and tall

swamp grass... along the riverbank... TO the base of the

Burbank Boulevard Overpass.

SLOWING ANGLE to discover precariously jutting out of the

ELLEN

... Before getting side-tracked

with viruses and T-S-R programs,

we were talking yesterday about

E-Mail.

INTERCUT Stevie. Ellen passes Stevie's computer as

he shares cryptic information with a kid sitting next

to him.

Ellen approaches her computer console on wheels at

the front of the class.

ELLEN

If you click-on the mail icon in

your tray, you'll be ready to

send and receive mail. My

computer's already set-up.

Everyone go ahead and click the

white envelope in the lower...

Ellen's interrupted by her own computer. A little white

envelope icon in the lower left hand tray flashes and

BEEPS. Now a COMPUTER VOICE announces: "You've got mail."

Ellen's taken aback.    Class titters.   Now she grins.

ELLEN

Looks like someone's way ahead of

me. Alright.

(adapts and

demonstrates)

To retrieve your mail simply double

click the top item in your mail

list.

(as she does)

Since we're all a part of the

same network, we share mail... so

go ahead and do that.

The message read:    TEACHER FUCKS NIGGERS

Class is dumbstruck. Ellen's riveted. Now she turns.

Without losing her temper, she scours the class with

a narrow gaze.

Class starts to buzz.    Now a clicking frenzy to retrieve

the same message.

The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all

around the classroom.

Ellen's POV of students (and Stevie). Deciphering

reactions. LINGERING ON Stevie's poker face.

Her own poker face now...

ELLEN

Whoever sent that message isn't

as anonymous as they think.

Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button.    A

new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to

the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in:

GO TO THE OFFICE

All the while anticipation builds on Stevie's face.    He

glances around, starting to get nervous.

Ellen now clicks the SEND button...

Stevie's COMPUTER BEEPS...    COMPUTER VOICE:   "You've got

mail..."

... A window opens in the middle of Stevie's monitor

revealing Ellen's return message.

Class erupts and Stevie springs out of his seat...

STEVIE

'Dat's bullshit, man!

He rushes up to the front of the class.

STEVIE

You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz

you can't prove nuthin'. And I

know you can't afford to lose

'dis minimum wage job 'a yers.

ELLEN

(beat and)

You're right, Stevie. I can't

afford to live in a big house

south of the boulevard. Like

you do.

Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-be

poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him

now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the

hallway door and exits the classroom.

ELLEN

Iris, did Steven Littleton come

in here?

IRIS

Haven't seen 'im.

Teacher #1, the insipid woman, checks her mail slot.    It's

her conference period.

TEACHER #1

(appalled)

You're not supposed to leave

your classroom unattended.

ELLEN

(reacting)

Sue me.

Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her

right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S

MOTHER (51).

IRIS

(offers; sotto)

Benny Chacon's mother. Told

'er Garcia had to leave early

today but she jus' sits there.

She been saying some pretty

crazy things.

Mrs. Chacon begins speaking Spanish in plaintive spurts.

Ellen can't decipher what she is saying...

ELLEN

(to Mrs. Chacon)

... Espanol, muy poquito, senora.

(beat)

Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down.

(back to Iris)

What's she saying?

Hesitating.    Now with apprehension...

IRIS

You heard 'bout that body they foun'

in the L.A. River... She says she

thinks it's Benny.

OFF Ellen's unblinking gaze...

116   EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE (DOWNTOWN) -          116

EVENING

A concrete fortress... Ellen and Mrs. Chacon approach.

92.

117   OMITTED                                                        117

118   INT. ASSISTANT CORONER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION            118

Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the

ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half-

eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam

cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder.

ASST. CORONER

You say he's been missing

approximately four weeks?

ELLEN

... Four, almost five weeks.

ASST. CORONER

That's a long time. Lots a

things happen to a body after

four or five weeks. Makes it

difficult to I.D.

A faint, incongruous smile.

ELLEN

(indicating John Doe)

So he just sits here?

ASST. CORONER

We keep 'um up to thirty days.

Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does

a month. Floaters, gangbangers,

illegals, junkies. Most of 'um

cheap homicides. Nobody's even

lookin' for 'em.

(indicating folder)

This guy here, has a dent in his

head. Could be post-mortem

trauma. Probably hit a retaining

wall on his way down river after

that rain we had. Who knows.

(beat)

Yuh ask me, this kid was dead

before he got his head caved in.

Overdose by morphine. That's what

it looks like t'me.

Ellen weighs it. Assistant Coroner now refers to some

sort of questionnaire.

ASST. CORONER

On the phone you said the mother

mentioned some identifying marks.

Ellen refocuses a far-off, introspective gaze.

(CONTINUED)

118   CONTINUED:                                                      118

ELLEN

(affirmative)

She said he has some pockmarks on

his chest; from a bad case of

chicken pox. And there's a bar-

code tattoo on his neck.

A cognitive flicker now as the Assistant Coroner sets

down his coffee...

119   INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - EVENING                                     119

The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting

her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand

next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet

covers the body.

Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet...

Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears.

She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come...

MRS. CHACON

... Benito.

As she comforts Mrs. Chacon...

ELLEN

(to Assistant Coroner;

sotto)

Did you find any rosary beads with

the body?

ASSISTANT CORONER

No.

120   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        120

... The digital clock next to Trevor's bed reads:

2:14 a.m.

Trevor sleeps. HOLD for a portentous moment. Now the

stillness is broken by a CLATTER at the front door.

Someone enters the house. Trevor awakens. Jolts out of

bed. Disoriented a beat.

121   INT. TREVOR'S HALLWAY                                           121

Trevor ventures through darkness...

TREVOR

... Who's there?

A light flickers on in the living room.

ELLEN (O.S.)

You should keep your door locked.

ADJUSTING the ANGLE now as the living room comes INTO

VIEW...

Ellen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling

her.

TREVOR

(still half asleep)

What's the matter?

Ellen ignores his question.

ELLEN

(impaling him with

a look)

I just want you to tell me one

thing...

Now something she sees stops her pacing...

... The black rosary beads on the dinner table.

TREVOR

(off Ellen's

puzzled look)

What?

Following her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads.    As he

places them in a drawer in the credenza.

TREVOR

What is it?

Ellen's confused.     Lost in a fixated gaze.

ELLEN

... If you had any idea what I've

been thinking lately... you'd

think I was crazy.

(running it through

her mind)

... Remember that John Doe they

found in the L.A. River. Turned

out it was Benny.

TREVOR

(impacted)

Who told you that?

ELLEN

... Benny's mother identified the

body.

Trevor just looks at her, a bated pause.       Now he blinks.

TREVOR

Benny was no saint, Ellen. This

is a kid who terrorized hald the

school. He even broke into your

house. Maybe we should think

about that 'fore we shed any tears.

Ellen just looks at him.

TREVOR

... Maybe he's better off.

ELLEN

That's a horrible thing to say.

Trevor accepts that it is.

TREVOR

Do you believe for every troubled

kid like Benny there's one or two

others just waiting to take his

place? Like Cesar... or his

friend Stevie.

An awkward moment of silence...

ELLEN

You don't know anything about

Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor?

TREVOR

Sometimes a person just runs out

of bad choices. Then he's gotta

pay a price. What happened to

Cesar was inevitable.

Ellen flickers a terrified smile.

ELLEN

You're scaring me.

TREVOR

We make choices in life and we

live by 'em. You and I chose to

be teachers, to stand on

principle. Benny and Cesar,

they're takers. They want what

they want, and they want it now.

ELLEN

Trevor...

TREVOR

(unravelling)

I'm sorry but everyone can't

always get what they want.

Sometimes you gotta take

responsibility for your actions.

Have you ever been ready to die

for a fundamental principle? They

haven't. You think those punks

would die protecting your Civil

Rights?

ELLEN

Trevor, don't.

TREVOR

Did you know Cesar hits his

mother? Steals money from her

purse? Did you know that?

Ellen blanches.

TREVOR

Did you know he was here that

night? In the alley?

ELLEN

(confused)

What are you talking about?

TREVOR

Cesar. Jack was provoked.     It

wasn't an accident, Ellen.    Cesar

killed him.

Ellen just stares at him.       Traumatized...

ELLEN

(momentous deliberation)

Where'd you get the rosary beads?

I like you, Ellen. I like you so

much. Do you believe that?

ELLEN

(riveted)

Yes.

Trevor can't find words.

ELLEN

With that, Ellen turns and walks out of the house as

quickly as she came.

TREVOR

Non-Hispanics, along with non-Quebradita cliques, look on

DAVE CHILDRESS

hanging back, on the fringes, scoping out the crowd.

Notices a pack of cigarettes in the chest pocket of a

15-year-old kid standing next to him. Kid's wrapped up

in talking to another kid, points to something O.S.

CHILDRESS

(to the kid with

cigarettes)

... Don't you know it's not polite

to point at people. Everytime you

point a finger at someone else...

(demonstrates)

... There's three fingers pointing

back at you.

Lemme have a cigarette.

At the same time, Steve follows him into the rest room.

They're all alone.

STEVIE

Eh, Mr. G?

Bracing himself with a fixed, straight-ahead look.

STEVIE

(boldly)

I'm talkin' ta you, Garfield.

(beat)

Know what you did to Cesar.

(wild notion)

... I'm thinkin' maybe you did

Benny, too.

(incredulously)

That possible? You crush my

friend's skull? Fuck 'im up wit'

a two-by-four, maybe a baseball

bat?

No response.   As Trevor starts to leave, Stevie blocks

his path.

Trevor steps to one side to go around... but Stevie

blocks his path again.

TREVOR

(trying to maintain)

Please, step out of the way.

STEVIE

... You kill my friend?   Huh?

Trevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart.

Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape...

but then suddenly snaps.

He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath-

room wall.

Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all.

Stevie immediately shrinks. Trevor now blinks. Cooling

himself down. Slowing his breathing. Stevie slips out

from under his hold and bolts for the exit.

Cesar and his tag-bangers... Cesar holds court, drowned

out by the MUSIC. Now Stevie arrives. Out of breath.

Urgent to tell his story.

Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse.

She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire

to be part of it, she moves a little closer...

... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's

news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage,

he shoves his way through the crowd.

Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio,

snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill.

With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie-

talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd...

Cesar shoves Rita to the ground.

Rita looks at him like he's insane.    Cesar's entourage

gathers around them.

RITA

Yer crazy.

She turns her back and starts to leave.       Cesar grabs

her again...

CESAR

Don't turn yer back on me when

I'm talkin' t'you, bitch. You

think yer better than everybody

else. Well you ain't! You ain't

Fuck you, Cesar.

CESAR

No, fuck you!

He grabs her blouse and rips it wide open. His eyes

glisten with fervor now as he punches Rita (with his

good hand) square in the face. She crumbles to the

ground as Victor bursts through the crowd and

restrains Cesar.

As Rita gets to her feet and flees into the Quebradita

crowd...

CESAR

The audience erupts in unanimous support...

ANGLO WOMAN

(playing to crowd now)

As a mother and a taxpayer, I have

a right to know. And if it was

gang-related then I want tighter

security...

At this point she's drowned out by the crowd.

On stage the discipline committee, including Trevor,

Childress, Hyland and Quinn sit at the dais. Garcia

stands at the podium, waiting for silence. MRS. FORD,

the assistant principal, a full-figured black woman in

the crowd to settle down.

That's something you heard on

the news. It's wrong. It's

misinformation.

HISPANIC MAN

Who says? How can you be so sure?

You're talking about my kid's

safety.

MRS. FORD

Please, everyone just calm down.

Audience settles.

MR. GARCIA

Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

(now)

... The police at this point

aren't even sure if it's a case of

murder. The reason we're having

this meeting tonight is to quash

all the rumors floating around out

there. Okay. Here's what we do

know. Benny Chacon ultimately died

from a drug overdose, technically

it was morphine.

(volume rising again)

Which is what heroin breaks down

into...

STEVIE (O.S.)

... Dat's bullshit! Benny was no

junkie! I know who did it!

Heads turn...

... Ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside

one of the doors at the back of the hall...

Up at the dais, Trevor notices her.

STEVIE

It's not the gangbangers y'gotta

worry about. It's the teachers!

MR. GARCIA

That's exactly the type of rumor

we don't need, Mr. Littleton.

Stevie deliberately stands and points at Trevor with

vitriol in his eyes...

STEVIE

... It was Garfield.

The audience grows silent.

MR. GARCIA

(losing his patience)

Say one more word and you're

suspended.

MRS. FORD

... Sit down, Stevie.

Trevor doesn't even flinch.       Childress scrutinizes him

with a glance.

STEVIE

(ranting)

You're a fuckin' murderer,

Garfield!

MR. GARCIA

(calling for assistance)

Victor?

STEVIE

... Maybe I can't prove it but I

know he did it. He fucked up

Cesar and he killed Benny.

(to crowd)

Ast 'im!

As Victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove

Stevie...

STEVIE

Touch me and I'll sue yer ass!

(as Victor backs off;

now to Trevor)

Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man!

With that Stevie shoves Victor aside and bolts for the

door.

Garcia attempts to regain his composure...

Trevor glances back to the spot where Ellen was

standing... but now she's gone.

Garfield, wait up...

Trevor maintains a steady pace, one hopeful eye scouring

the parking lot for Ellen...

CHILDRESS

Trevor ignores him.

CHILDRESS

Lil' bastard's a tweaker. He's a

speed freak. You didn't know that?

At Trevor's car now.    Hesitating.    Turning to

Childress...

TREVOR

What is it, Dave? How can I help

you?

Unintentionally in Trevor's face...

CHILDRESS

How 'bout a ride?

(taking a step back)

... The wife wouldn't let me drive

my own car. Ain't that a bitch?

Childress is pitiful. Wears a grease-stained tie with

his wrinkled Hawaiian shirt and a Windbreaker.

TREVOR

(with resignation)

... You smell like beer.

CHILDRESS

I only had two. That's all.

Swear ta Christ.

Raising his palms. Surrendering.       Trevor studies him

Garage door open.

Childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans

against the dented fender of his '66 Lincoln Continental.

Trevor nurses a Diet Coke...

CHILDRESS

... I had the same situation

'round the time of that 'Night

Stalker' thing. Remember that?

Whole city was scared shitless.

My wife was convinced the frickin'

mailman was the 'Stalker' for

about a week there.

(a tubercular chuckle)

Some mental giant in my 4th period

starts this rumor, see. Childress

is the 'Night Stalker.' Right?

(chug-a-lugs)

... Idiots. Even after they

caught that Ramirez jerk, I'd

still hear those fucks '... They

got the wrong guy. Childress is

the Stalker, ese.'

He finishes beer.    Crumples it.

Trevor studies him, without expression. Now he notices

something stapled to the tar paper wall...

Trevor's POV of the "Certificate of Excellence in

Teaching," yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by

one staple.

... as Childress opens another beer.

TREVOR

(excusing himself)

I better get goin'. Thanks for

the soda.

CHILDRESS

Wait, wait. Hold your horses.

Just hold on...

... Finding a key in a drawer.

CHILDRESS

A watery glint in his bloodshot eyes. Cabinet door

swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns...

CHILDRESS

Ta-dah... Huh?

Trevor's eyes remain expressionless.

Childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of

the guns...

CHILDRESS

... This one's from

Czechoslovakia. It's a C-Z .22

automatic. Ten round clip. Glow-

in-the-dark sights.

(eyeing the sights)

Ain't that a beauty?

(next)

... Then we gotta custom Smitty, 9

'milli.' With extended grip.

These Smith & Wessons kick like a

mutha.

(and next)

Now this one's special. A Glock

21. Lightest gun in the world.

The barrel and firing pin are

metal. See. Everything else on

it's plastic.

(handing it to Trevor)

Here, feel that.

Trevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his

hand. Sets it down.

Now Childress removes a gun from a holster in the small

of his back, under his Windbreaker...

CHILDRESS

... 'Course you can never be too

prepared. My pukey lil' Davis

.380.

TREVOR

(a severe squint)

You wear that thing at school?

(a wry grin)

... But you already know that.

Didn't think I was payin'

attention, did'ja? Shoulda seen

the look on your face.

Pretending now.    Aiming the .380 at an imaginary

student...

CHILDRESS

Now, Jose, if I've told you once

I've told you a hundred times,

stay in your cotton pickin' seat.

(aiming gun)

Boom!

Childress laughs and chokes on his cigarette. Now he

gazes at the .380 in his hand. Lost in a stupid,

recalcitrant grin...

CHILDRESS

Haven't you ever just wanted to

blow one of these little bastards

away?

Childress glances up into Trevor's unflinching gaze.

Smiles to himself now. Thinks he's funny...

CHILDRESS

(digressing)

... Speaking of blowing, you ever

wanna fuck a high school girl,

Garfield?

(off no response)

'Caught yer girl, Rita, bustin' a

train out in the 'utility' shed

couple months back. Swear to God.

She had at least five or six

cholos lined up back there.

(as Trevor's eyes

narrow)

Face it, brother, she's a slut.

C'mon, I know you had 'er.

I even did her.

I'm talkin' about screwin' high

school broads and you're givin'

Childress rolls back on his heels.

CHILDRESS

... Tell me the truth now,

Garfield. Did yuh do it? C'mon,

I won't tell. Did yuh whack Benny?

Whadda 'bout Cesar? That was

generous, only taking his finger.

I woulda cut off his balls.

TREVOR

... Go to hell, Dave.

All traces of a smile fade from Dave's face.      Trevor

just stands there. Doesn't say a damn word.

Childress makes his own momentous conclusion.

CHILDRESS

(almost exulted)

You really did it. You son of a

bitch.

Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye.     Leans

forward, hangs a hand on Trevor's shoulder.

TREVOR

(disgusted)

You probably think you and me are

alike.

Trevor turns and exits the garage. PULLING BACK FROM

Childress's dull anesthetized gaze. Deep down inside

Childress knows he's a pathetic piece of shit...

Trevor pulls into his driveway, right up to the garage

129A   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (SHORT WHILE LATER)             129A

Dimly lit. Trevor stands in front of the television

set, staring at a late-night repeat of "Talk Soup."

INSERT - TALK SOUP

A clip from "Sally Jessy Rafael" or "Jerry Springer."

One of those Sturm und Drang moments. Everyone points

the finger at everyone else. No one willing to take

responsibility for themselves.

Only partially watching the television. His eyes are

fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind, lost to the

world.

130    INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS SCHOOL LIBRARY - EARLY MORNING             130

(BEFORE SCHOOL)

Into a parabolic mirror above the library doors...

... an empty corridor stretches forever.

Trevor, now unshaven, looking like he hasn't slept, sits

amidst total silence in his regular spot. No sign of

Rita. He checks his wristwatch.

WALL CLOCK

reads... 7:10 AM.

BACK TO:

TREVOR

peering toward the library doors.   Nothing.   Now above

the doors...

TREVOR'S POV

BACK AND FORTH between the mirror and Trevor.   His eyes

glazed and unblinking.

FURTHER INTO the parabolic mirror now.   Breathing becoming

more and more labored.

In a flicker, we're transported back to Roosevelt

Whitney... Dennis Broadway's image SLOWLY COMING TOWARD

us down the long corridor...

BACK TO SCENE

Trevor catches his breath and blinks...

... Back to reality.    The mirror is empty.

He removes his Proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket.

Suppressing gasps, he takes two hits.

Two girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other,

eyes firmly fixed on Trevor.

Suddenly there's a presence at Trevor's side...

LIBRARIAN

... I don't think she's coming.

131   EXT. RITA'S TRAILER (SUN VALLEY) - SAME MORNING                 131

(7:30 AM)

Strictly low rent district. The small dirt yard in front

is contained within a cinder block wall.

Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right)

eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger

brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her

three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be

carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys...

RITA

Be nice to your brother, Antonio.

Don't make me go get Mommie.

Trevor's car pulls up.    Rita's taken aback.

RITA

(setting Maricella

down)

Go play wit' your brothers.

Rita attempts to thwart him at the sidewalk.

RITA

(almost defensive)

Whatcha doin' here, maestro?

(CONTINUED)

131   CONTINUED:                                                       131

TREVOR

(with fervor)

I want you to come back to school,

Rita. You can't afford to miss

finals. They won't let you

graduate.

RITA

(overlapping)

No way. Forget it. I can't.

What's wrong wit' you.

Trevor really does looks like hell.

TREVOR

(beseeching her)

Cesar and Stevie won't bother you.

That's a promise.

Something stirs deep inside her.

RITA

(struggles with it)

Why'd they have to kill Snowball?

TREVOR

... They didn't.

RITA

(on the verge of

tears now)

What's it fuckin' matter?! 'At

school shit's for other kids, not

me!

TREVOR

That's not true. You're so smart,

Rita. Don't you know that? You

have an opportunity here to change

your life. Please don't throw

away everything we've worked for.

Trevor just stares at her, incredulously.

Rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye.

Momentous deliberation, and now...

TREVOR

I know what happened with Childress.

RITA

(knitting her

eyebrows)

What?

TREVOR

(beat)

He won't ever touch you again.

RITA

(protesting too

much)

He ain't done nuthin' tuh me.

That boy's fulla shit. What's he

been sayin'?

TREVOR

Doesn't matter.

RITA

He ain't never touched me no ways.

What's he sayin'? He say he

fucked me?! He say dat?!

(off Trevor's look)

He's a damn liar!

(erupting again;

tears streaming

down her face)

Get the fuck outta here! I don't

need yer damn pity and I don't

need you!

TREVOR

(genuinely)

But I need you, Rita.

Beat.

RITA

(hardening)

You made a mistake.    Dat's all.

With that Rita scoops up Maricella and exits.

132   INT. MR. GARCIA'S OFFICE - SAME DAY (LUNCH PERIOD)                132

Trevor sits transfixed in front of Garcia.       Still hasn't

shaven.

MR. GARCIA

See these?

Garcia holds up a handful of phone messages.

MR. GARCIA

They're phone calls about you.

Good ones.

MR. GARCIA (CONT'D)

Cesar's mother told me how you

tried to help him. You're evidently

a good teacher. You should be

commended on your efforts. However...

(pause)

I'm going to have to let you go.

Trevor blinks.

MR. GARCIA

(beat)

As much as I'd like to have you

stay until the end of the year, I

can't overlook the seriousness of

certain accusations.

Mr. Garcia waits for a response but none is forthcoming.

MR. GARCIA

(for example)

... Is it true you had meetings with

a female student at your house?

TREVOR

I was trying to help her.

MR. GARCIA

The implications are still there,

Mr. Garfield. I can't afford to

open the door for another lawsuit.

Sure you can appreciate my position.

(pause)

You can stay until Friday. I hope

that will be sufficient.

This part registers only minimally with Trevor.

133   EXT. BUNGALOW 86 - AFTER SCHOOL (SAME DAY)                      133

A VAPID SILENCE HOLDS us. The bungalow is awash in a

sun-soaked pool of light...

Trevor makes his way toward the parking lot with his

briefcase and a cardboard box of personal belongings.

HYLAND

You're not being an alarmist.

(minimizing her

concerns)

He gets a little overzealous at

times... like some other people

I know.

(beat)

I don't think the rosary adds up

to much either, frankly.

ELLEN

Why?

HYLAND

It's probably his.

(beat)

Look, when I received my first

Holy Communion all the boys got

black rosaries and the girls got

white. Trust me, there must be

millions of black rosaries filed

away in desk drawers from here to

the Vatican.

Ellen flickers a sad indecisive smile.

HYLAND

This guy's been through a lot,

Ellen. The system failed him.

I don't think any of us can really

appreciate what he's been through.

(beat)

I say we give the man a break.

Ellen acquiesces a pensive nod.

BACK TO:

TREVOR

Rivetted. Now he slides the cardboard box, along with

his briefcase onto the front seat.

Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, Ellen pulls up in her

Cherokee.

She deciphers Trevor with mixed emotions.        Trevor adjusts

his stance, covering the "187."

Ellen now tentatively rolls her window down halfway...

TAILPIPE SPUTTERS, a portentous idle.

ELLEN

(stilted)

... I'd like to apologize for

the other night.

Trevor stands there transfixed for a moment.       Now he

looks into her eyes. A soulful gaze.

TREVOR

Shouldn't listen to me.    I was

half asleep.

His eyes become damp.    Trevor smiles bravely.

ELLEN

We really need to talk.

TREVOR

... Not tonight. Have to finish

some work...

ELLEN

Tomorrow then?     It's important

to me.

TREVOR

(far off now)

... Okay.

ELLEN

Trevor nods.    Ellen flickers a tenuous smile.

All three tag-bangers produce firearms... Cesar loads the

cylinder chamber on his .357 magnum. Stevie double

checks a 7 round clip and a 39 Smith and Wesson. And

Paco plays with a .38 caliber revolver that he hides in

the deep front pocket of is County-Bens.

The interior of the Buick snaps with the hard sound of

gun metal... cocking hammers, loading cartridges and

spinning cylinder chambers...

... As the gun preparations systematically stop. Cesar

now flicks ON an ELECTRIC HAIR CLIPPER, sets it on 'NO

CLIP,' and passes it back to Paco. Paco runs the clipper

over his head. Hair tumbles off in chunks. Stevie

fidgets, picks up a naked one-eyed doll off the floor,

raises it INTO VIEW...

TREVOR

Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.

CESAR

Dont' move, mutha fucka!

Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in

the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams

his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.

CESAR

You killed Benny. And you cut off

my finger... Say it.

Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.

TREVOR

Yeah.   I did.

STEVIE

Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.

PACO

Lemme do 'im.

CESAR

No.   This nigga's mine.

Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes

into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor

as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.

CESAR

You gon' do yourself, mayate.

Put it to your head and pull the

trigger.

Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to

his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.

He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.

A crazed, watery glint in his eye.

TREVOR

That macho enough for you, Cesar?

Huh? That make me a man?

bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.

CESAR

He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.

TREVOR

You think you got respect now?

Your kinda respect is bullshit.

Only thing you honor is stupidity.

You ready to die for stupidity,

Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you

somethin'. See you can't kill me,

I'm never gonna get it back -- no

He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the

trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the

TREVOR

You can't kill me... and you can't

scare me.

Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun

TWO WEEKS LATER

... the marquee outside the school reads...

HAPPY GRADUATION -- CLASS OF '97

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

... The teacher has been

identified as forty-one-year-old

Trevor Garfield, formerly of

New York City. Most recently he

taught science at John Quincy Adams

High School in the San Fernando

Valley...

(beat)

Confidential sources reveal that

the teacher had publicly been

accused of foul play in the

death of another student whose

body was discovered just last

month in the L.A. River...

168A   EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - AFTERNOON                                 168A

Graduation in progress. Standing room only.

Administrators have begun to take their seats up on a

makeshift stage. Garcia, Hyland, Assistant Principal

Ford, etc...

Bleachers now as guests and family members fan themselves

against the searing heat. A banner strung across the top

row of seats reads...

CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF '97

Faculty members are seated in the first two rows down

on the field. In front of a sea of mortar boards.

Dave Childress now enters, his usual shabby attire,

nursing another hangover. He takes a seat away from the

other teachers.

168B   EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - PODIUM - SHORT WHILE LATER                168B

As the first speaker approaches the podium...

ON two inch high heels, an occasional wobble as the white

high heels make their way up to the podium. ANGLE RISING

now, LINGERING ON a clinging powder blue dress and mani-

cured fingernails. HOLD ON her clenched essay. Now

CONTINUE UP to reveal Rita Nartinez.

She wears lipstick... and only a moderate amount of eye

shadow. She wears a slightly nervous, preoccupied look.

Now...

Rita at the podium, as she adjusts the microphone, a

nervous reflex. Places her essay on the podium. Stares

down at it...

RITA

... The title of my essay is,

'Mi Vida Loca'... 'My Crazy Life'...

Rita hesitates.    Now she gazes out at the graduating

class.

168C   FACES IN CROWD                                                  168C

Waiting... Intently fanning themselves...

168D   DAVE CHILDRESS                                                  168D

Apathetic. Arms draped over the empty chairs on either

side of him.

168E   BACK TO RITA                                                    168E

RITA

(turning to Quinn)

Ms. Quinn, can I say somethin'?

(correcting

herself)

... May I say something?

Ms. Quinn (45) hesitates, now acquiesces with

uncertainty...

RITA

... There's been a lotta talk las'

couple weeks whether Mr. Garfield

done those things they been writin'

about in the newspaper. He once

tol' me you can't blame everything

on yer environment.

But I t'ink you can push a good

teacher too far and he might jus'

go bad like anybody else...

INTERCUT VARIOUS CUTS OF Ellen's hands as she clears a

bulletin board... removes a computer graphics display from

a wall... empties desk drawers... and packs away her

computer in a box.

RITA (V.O.)

... I dunno if Mr. 'G' did all

those bad things. All I know

is dat teachers don't get no

respect. 'At's the simple truth.

And if Mr. 'G' is responsible,

well den he ain't the only one

responsible...

BACK TO:

174    INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS AUDITORIUM - PODIUM (GRADUATION)              174

RITA

... We're all responsible. You and

me... all of us. I'm up here today

cuz a him. He was dere for me

when nobody else was. Thing is...

I shoulda been 'dere for him

too... but I wasn't. I turned

my back on the only person who

ever cared about me.

(pause)

He said if I could stand up here

and read my essay it would be a

Pyrrhic victory.

(beat)

I ast' 'im, 'What's up wit' dat?'

A trickle of incongruous laughter, awkward yet

cathartic...

RITA

He told me in my case it was

irony... and to go look it up...

so I did.

(beat)

I wonder now if Mr. 'G' was really

talking 'bout hisself.

(beat)

It refers to this guy named

Pyrrhus. He was a king back

'round 300 B.C.

Rita refers to a piece of scratch paper she has tucked

inside her essay...

INTERCUT ELLEN AND:

again... as she now empties one last drawer, she dis-

covers her teaching credential. Reluctantly picks it up.

Holds it for a moment. Now read across the face of the

credential...

RITA (V.O.)

(verbatim now)

... Pyrrhus defeated the Romans

on two occasions. But those two

victories lost him a large part

of his army. Now whenever people

say something's a Pyrrhic victory

they mean it's a victory gained

at too great a cost.

Childress stares off into space, flickers a pathetic smirk.

And now Stevie seated amongst the graduates. Glancing

up from under his mortar board cap. He adjusts

a gaze into the bleachers.

126.

175B   STEVIE LITTLETON'S POV - HIS PARENTS                             175B

Early forties, upper-middle class. Stevie's mother

catches his eye. Like an incongruous SLOW MOTION dream,

she mouth the words, "Were... So... Proud... Of... You."

now at the podium. Holding back tears, Rita now carefully

folds up her piece of scratch paper... and fixes a distant

unblinking gaze...

... Slowly SCAN the walls, stripped completely bare now.

END ON Ellen standing obliquely in the doorway. Brief-

case in hand, files and papers tucked under one arm. Her

face, a solemn vacuous gaze.

Now she drops something into the trash can, shuts off the

lights, and leaves. As the door slowly closes...

MOVE IN ON the trash can...

... and Ellen's crumpled teaching credential.   Add another

name to the list of fallen heroes as we...

CUT TO:

BLACKNESS

... and ROLL END CREDITS.

THE END
