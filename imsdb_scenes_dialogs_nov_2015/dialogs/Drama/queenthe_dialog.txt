COMMENTARY

..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years

old, arriving at the polling station

of his constituency in Sedgefield.."

ELIZABETH

Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?

ARTIST

(proudly dabbing palette)

Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they

opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.

COMMENTARY

If he wins, he'll be the youngest

Prime Minister in almost two hundred

years.."

ARTIST

And I don't mind telling you, it

wasn't for Mr Blair.

ELIZABETH

Not a moderniser, then?

ARTIST

Certainly not. We're in danger of

losing too much that's good about this

country as it is.

TV COMMENTARY

"The only questions that still remain:

how big will his landslide be? And how

extensive, how sweeping will the

modernisation programme be that he

ushers in?"

ELIZABETH

Hmm.

ELIZABETH

I rather envy you being able to vote.

(a beat)

Not the actual ticking of the box,

although, I suppose, it would be nice

to experience that ONCE.

(a beat)

But the sheer joy of being partial.

ARTIST

Yes..

ARTIST

One forgets that as Sovereign, you are

not entitled to vote.

ELIZABETH

No.

ARTIST

Still, you won't catch me feeling

sorry for you. You might not be

allowed to vote, Ma'am..

(a beat)

But it IS your Government.

ELIZABETH

Yes.

ELIZABETH

I suppose that is some consolation.

FADE TO BLACK:

t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up

MAID

G'morning, Ma'am.

DRESSER

Shall I draw the curtains?

ELIZABETH (O.S)

Did you stay up?

DRESSER

Yes, Ma'am.

ELIZABETH (O.S)

And? Was it as expected..?

RESSER

Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.

4.

ELIZABETH

I see.

"IT'S BLAIR!", "LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR BLAIR".

JANVRIN

The Prime Minister is on his way,

Ma'am.

ELIZABETH

To BE, Robin.

(correcting, terse)

Prime Minister to BE.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

He hasn't asked my permission yet.

ELIZABETH

He's a hard one to read, isn't he?

JANVRIN

Yes. On the one hand his background is

quite establishment. Father a

Conservative. A public school

education at Fettes, where he was

tutored by the same man as the Prince

of Wales.

ELIZABETH

Well, we'll try not to hold that

against him.

5.

JANVRIN

On the other, his manifesto promises

the most radical modernisation and

shake-up of the Constitution in three

hundred years.

ELIZABETH

Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do

you think?

JANVRIN

I wouldn't put it past him. He's

married to a woman with known anti-

Monarchist sympathies - you may

remember her curtsey the first time

you met. It could best be described as

`shallow'.

ELIZABETH

I don't measure the depth of a

curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my

sister.

JANVRIN

And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary

who said he was expecting the

atmosphere at Downing Street to be

very informal. Everyone on first name

terms.

(a beat)

At the Prime Minister's insistence.

ELIZABETH

What? As in `Call me Tony?'

JANVRIN

Yes.

ELIZABETH

Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of

that.

(a beat)

Have we sent him a protocol sheet?

6.

TONY

Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

HERIE

hy? You've met her often enough

before.

TONY

I know. But never one to one. And

never as Prime Minister.

CHERIE

Remember, you're a man that's just

been elected by the whole country.

T

TONY

Yes. But she's still, y'know..

TONY

The Queen.

EQUERRY

When we reach the audience room, I

will knock. We will not wait to be

called, we will go straight inside.

Standing by the door, we bow. From the

neck. I will introduce you. The Queen

will extend her hand, you go to her,

bow again, then shake her hand.

QUERRY (cont'd)

Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am'

as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.

TONY

Yes..

EQUERRY

And when you're in the Presence, at no

point must you show your back.

7.

TONY

The `Presence'?

EQUERRY

Yes, Sir. That's what it's called,

when you're in her Majesty's company.

TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers

EQUERRY

Mr Blair, your Majesty.

ELIZABETH

ongratulations.

TONY

Thank you, Ma'am.

ELIZABETH

Your children must be very proud.

TONY

I hope so.

ELIZABETH

You've three, haven't you?

TONY

That's right.

ELIZABETH

How lovely. Such a blessing. Children.

ELIZABETH

So..Have we shown you how to start a

nuclear war yet?

8.

TONY

(thrown)

No.

ELIZABETH

First thing we do, I believe.

a beat)

Then we take your passport and spend

the rest of the time sending you

around the world.

TONY

You obviously know my job better than

I do.

ELIZABETH

Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister,

Mr Blair. I'd like to think there

weren't too many surprises left. My

first was Winston Churchill. He sat in

your chair, in frock coat and top hat,

and was kind enough to give a shy

T

young girl like me quite an education.

TONY

I can imagine.

ELIZABETH

ith time, one has hopefully added

experience to that education, and a

little wisdom - better enabling us to

execute our constitutional

responsibility.

(a pointed addition)

To advise, guide and warn the

government of the day.

TONY

Advice which I look forward to

receiving.

ELIZABETH

ell, we will save that for our weekly

meetings.

a beat)

Now, if there's nothing else, I

believe we have some business to

attend to..

TONY

Of course..

9.

TONY

Your Majesty, the country has

spoken...and I come now to ask your

permiss..   E

ELIZABETH

(interjecting)

No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask

the questions.

TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.

ELIZABETH

Mr Blair, the people have elected you

to be their leader. And so the duty

falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask

you to become Prime Minister, and form

a government in my name.

TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..

ELIZABETH

Generally, this is where you say

`yes.'

TONY

`Yes'.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.

HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly..

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

You must be very proud.

HERIE

Yes.

ELIZABETH

And exhausted, I imagine. Where will

you be spending the summer?

CHERIE

France.

ELIZABETH

How lovely.

TONY

ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.

10.

ELIZABETH

Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful

place.

ELIZABETH

My great, great grandmother said of it

- "In Balmoral all seems to breathe

freedom and peace and to make one

forget the world and its sad

turmoils."

t that moment, the doors open, and JANVRIN enters, and

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

Really..?

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

I'm afraid we're going to have to

leave it there.

ELIZABETH

Not too short, was it? I gave him

fifteen minutes.

(a beat)

One doesn't want to be rude.

CHERIE

(mimics QUEEN's manner)

"Thank you so much for coming. Now

bugger off."

TONY

I know. What was all that about?

CHERIE

Diana. Apparently she's got a new

boyfriend.

Something about Diana managing to be

even more annoying dead than alive.

Just make sure the boys never hear you

talk like that.

Of course.

Thank you.

HERIE appears in the doorway.

TONY

Is it your intention to make some kind

of appearance. Or statement?

ELIZABETH

Certainly not.

ELIZABETH

No member of the Royal family will

speak publicly about this. It is a

private matter and we would all

appreciate it if it could be respected

as such.

TONY

I see.

TONY

I don't suppose anyone has had time to

think about the funeral yet?

ELIZABETH

We've spoken to the Spencer family,

and it's their wish..

(a beat)

..their express wish, that it should

be a private funeral. With a memorial

service to follow in a month, or so.

TONY

Right.

ELIZABETH

Given that Diana was no longer a

member of the Royal Family we have no

choice but to respect their wishes.

TONY

I see.

high profile and popularity..

Or even just to her as a mother?

ELIZABETH

As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.

TONY (cont'd)

And the public, Ma'am? The British

People?

TONY

You don't think a private funeral

would be denying them a chance..

ELIZABETH

hance to what..?

TONY

To share in the grief?

ELIZABETH

It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not

a fairground attraction.

I think the Princess has already paid

a high enough price for exposure to

the press, don't you?

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

Now, if there is nothing else I must

get on. The children have to be looked

after.

TONY

Of course.

TONY (cont'd)

Good bye, Your Majesty.

TONY

Her instinct is to do nothing. Say

nothing. And give her a private

funeral.

Are you surprised? She hated her guts.

Well, I think it's a mistake.

they don't screw up her death.

ELIZABETH

One - lower the flag to half-mast

above Buckingham Palace and all other

Royal residences. Two - leave

Balmoral, and fly down to London at

the earliest opportunity. Three - pay

respects in person at Diana's coffin.

And four - make a statement via live

television to my people and the world.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

Swift prosecution of these matters, he

felt, might, just might avert

disaster.

bviously you're going to have to talk

to the Lord Chamberlain about all

this.

ELIZABETH

I have.

UEEN MOTHER

And to Robert Fellowes.

ELIZABETH

To him too.

UEEN MOTHER

And..?

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

It seems they both agree with him.

QUEEN MOTHER

I see.

he QUEEN stares. Then..

ELIZABETH

Something's happened. There's been a

change...a shift of values..

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

When you no longer understand your

people, isn't it time to hand over to

the next generation?

QUEEN MOTHER

Certainly not! Remember the oath you

took

ELIZABETH

"I declare that my whole life, whether

it be long or short, shall be devoted

to your service."

QUEEN MOTHER

Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment

to God as well as your people.

ELIZABETH

But if my actions are damaging the

crown?

QUEEN MOTHER

Damaging them? My dear, you are the

greatest asset this institution has.

One of the greatest it has EVER had.

The problem will come when you leave,

but that's not for you to worry about -

and certainly not today.

he Queen rolls her eyes..

ELIZABETH

Mummy..

76.

ELIZABETH

It's just no one seems to value

tradition or constancy any more.

(a beat)

It's all about show. About wearing

your heart on your sleeve.

QUEEN MOTHER

And you're not like that. Never have

been. No...you must show strength. Re-

assert your authority. You sit on the

most powerful throne in Europe. Head

of an unbroken line that goes back

more than a thousand years. How many

of your predecessors do you imagine

would have dropped everything and gone

down to London because people holding

candles wanted help with their grief?

And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire

Bloody madness!

NEWS READER (ON T.V.)

We are just getting some pictures now

from Balmoral. These are rather

historic shots. Clearly the Queen has

responded to criticism that the Royal

Family is not engaged..

TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..

TONY

(to himself)

Thank God for that.

CHERIE (cont'd)

It's fish-fingers. Want any?

TONY

Be right there.

I'm afraid they're a bit burned.

Where are the boys? Have they already

left?

ELIZABETH

Yes. They left for London after

breakfast. With Charles.

HILIP shakes his head..

PRINCE PHILIP

It's not right, you know

ELIZABETH

Yes, but further discussion is no

longer helpful either.

PRINCE PHILIP

Oh, well. I suppose it gives the

ghillies time to find a new stag for

the boys now theirs has been shot.

ELIZABETH

What?

PRINCE PHILIP

Haven't you heard? It wandered onto

one of the neighbouring estates where

it was shot by one of the commercial

guests.

ELIZABETH

Really..?

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

Which estate?

Here's your box. There's some

And you've seen the papers?

I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've

seen the papers.

says so?" "Tony Blair."

LASTAIR reaches the door - sees TONY. Then..

Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship

you've come to see?

No, no..please don't disturb him. I've

come on another matter. I hope you

don't mind..

There he is..

Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An

London.

HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)

I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow

him for miles - to finish him off.

Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

Please pass my congratulations to your

guest.

I will, Ma'am.

Yes, Robin..

JANVRIN

I've done a draft of your television

address.

Thank you.

Was there anything else?

JANVRIN

No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.

Shall I give Tony a copy?

Let me have a look at it first.

They sent a copy of the Queen's

ALASTAIR (CONT'D)

You might want to scrape the frost off

ALASTAIR

I made a couple of changes. So it

sounds like it comes from a human

being.

ALASTAIR

Oh, and one bit of good news. The old

boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects

at Diana's coffin.

TONY

You know when you get it wrong, you

REALLY get it wrong.

That woman has given her whole life in

service to her people - fifty years

doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job

she watched kill her father. She's

executed it with dignity, honour and,

as far as I can tell, without a single

blemish - and now we line up baying

for her blood - why? Because she's

struggling to lead the world in

mourning for a woman who threw

everything she offered back in her

face, and who seemed, in the last few

years, to be committed twenty-four

seven to destroy everything she holds

dear.

TONY storms off.

Would you like me to place them for

No.

Oh.

They're for you.

For me..?

Your Majesty, there's a last minute

addition from Downing Street. They're

suggesting adding `..and as a

grandmother..' here.

ELIZABETH

Right.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

"So what I say to you now, as your

Queen and as a grandmother, I say from

my heart."

JANVRIN

You think you can say it?

87.

ELIZABETH

Do I have a choice?

IRECTOR

We're ready for you, your Majesty..

DIRECTOR

Just to confirm this is going out

live.

ELIZABETH

Right

DIRECTOR

And you'll be at the front of the six

o'clock news on all the channels

ELIZABETH

I see.

FLOOR MANAGER

(calling out)

Ten seconds, everyone..

DIRECTOR (cont'd)

Five, four..

ELIZABETH

Since last Saturday's dreadful news we

have seen, throughout Britain and the

world, an overwhelming expression of

sadness at Diana's death..

NT. CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME

he QUEEN continues..

88.

ELIZABETH

We have all been trying in our

different ways to cope. The initial

shock is often succeeded by a mixture

of other feelings. Disbelief,

incomprehension, anger and concern for

those who remain.

ELIZABETH (ON TV)

We have all felt these emotions in

these last few days. So what I say to

you now, as your Queen and as a

grandmother, I say from my heart...

CHERIE

"Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't

mean a word of this.

TONY

That's not the point. What she's doing

is extraordinary.

(points to the TV)

That's how you survive.

CHERIE

Listen to you! A week ago you were the

great moderniser, making speeches

about the "People's Princess", now

you've gone weak at the knees.

CHERIE

I don't know why I'm surprised. In the

end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga-

ga for her Maj.

ELIZABETH (ON TV)

I hope that tomorrow we can all,

wherever we are, join in expressing

our grief at Diana's loss, and

gratitude for her all-too-short life.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

May those who died rest in peace and

may we, each and every one of us..

many people happy.

So? Off to see your girlfriend?

Now, now..

I hope she shows you some respect this

she owes you.

Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."

TONY shoots his cuffs. Clears his throat. The EQUERRY knocks.

Do sit down.

Thank you.

TONY sits, and stares at the QUEEN. Her face is inscrutable.

It's good to see you again. After

quite a summer..

I'm referring to your visit to India

and Pakistan, where your comments

about ending historic disagreements

went down very well.

TONY (cont'd)

And the Commonwealth Heads of

Government Meeting. I spoke to the

Prime Minister of Malawi, who was

saying how much he appreciated your

tough stance on Nigeria.

92.

TONY

I meant to tell you at the time but

you were being monopolised rather.

ilence.

TONY

I imagine those occasions are quite

difficult. Twenty-four heads of

Government each clamouring for a

private audience..

TONY

Also, we haven't had a chance to speak

since THAT week. And I wanted to offer

my apologies..

ELIZABETH

Whatever for?

TONY

In case you'd felt `manhandled' or

`managed' in any way.

ELIZABETH

Not at all.

ELIZABETH

I don't think I shall ever understand

what happened this summer.

TONY

The circumstances were exceptional,

Ma'am. And in the end, you showed

great personal strength, courage, and

humility.   E

ELIZABETH

ou're confusing humility with

humiliation.

TONY

That's not true.

ELIZABETH

You didn't hear what they were saying

in the Mall that Friday.

93.

TONY

I still believe History will show it

was a good week for you.

ELIZABETH

And an even better one for you, Mr

Blair.

TONY

But there are fifty-two weeks in a

year, Ma'am. And two and a half

thousand in a half century.

TONY

And when people come to assess your

legacy, no one will remember those few

days.

ELIZABETH

Really?

ELIZABETH

You don't feel that what respect or

affection people might once have had

for..

ELIZABETH

..this institution has been

diminished?

TONY

Not at all.

ELIZABETH

I gather some of your closest advisors

were less fulsome in their support..

TONY

One or two. But as a leader one

has...a different perspective.

a beat)

I could never have added my voice to

the chorus.

ELIZABETH

You're very kind.

94.

ELIZABETH

But let's also not forget the more

pragmatic reason.

TONY

Which is?

ELIZABETH

That without me there to distract

everyone, it'd suddenly become

embarrassingly clear how much

unchecked power the British Prime

Minister actually has.

TONY looks up..

ELIZABETH

If fifty years of doing MY job has

taught me anything, it is that the

people doing YOURS generally prefer me

with all my faults to some kind of

meddling President..

(a beat)

Just look at the French.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

I suppose we'd better get on with the

business in hand..

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

I do love this time of day. Shall we

walk while there's still some sunshine

left? I do hope you're a walker.

TONY

I am.

ELIZABETH

Good. The clocks go back next week,

then it'll be dark by five.

ELIZABETH (cont'd)

I always think these meetings stand a

better chance of succeeding if the

Prime Minister is a walker.

95.

ELIZABETH

As a matter of fact, it's how I think

best. On my feet. I've never been one

for sitting around endlessly. A good

walk and fresh air sorts everything

out..

ELIZABETH

One in four, you said? Wanted to get

rid of me? T

TONY

For about half an hour. But then you

came down to London and all that went

away.

ELIZABETH

I've never been hated like that

before.

TONY

No. And that must have been difficult.

ELIZABETH

It was. Very.

ELIZABETH

Ever since Diana people want glamour

and tears..the grand performance..and

I'm not very good at that. I prefer to

keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly

I believed that's what people wanted

from their Queen. Not to make a fuss

nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve,

duty first... self second.

ELIZABETH

It's how I was brought up. It's all

I've ever known

TONY

One forgets. You were so young when

you became Queen.

96.

ELIZABETH

I was. A girl.

ELIZABETH

But I can see the world has changed.

And one must 'modernise'.

TONY

Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

ELIZABETH

(with a twinkle as they set off)

Don't get ahead of yourself Prime-

minister, I think you'll find that I'm

supposed to be advising YOU!

ELIZABETH

So...what might we expect in your

first Parliament?

TONY

Well, Ma'am, top of the list is

education reform. We want to radically

reduce classroom sizes...
