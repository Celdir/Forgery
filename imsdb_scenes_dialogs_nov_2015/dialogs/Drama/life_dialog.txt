SHOOTING DRAFT

1999

CHAPLAIN

In accordance with the regulations

of the State of Mississippi, we gather

here today to lay to rest the remains

of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316,

and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to

ashes, dust to dust. May God have

mercy on their souls.

BURKE

Go ahead, fellas.

NURSE HUMPHRIES

I'll come back for you in a little

while, Willie...

JAKE

These two guys friends of yours, old

man?

WILLIE

We spent some time together.

LEON

Why do I get the feeling when you

say some time, you mean some time.

WILLIE

I was already here a good many years

when they came in in 1932.

LEON

1932? That's like, that's like...

WILLIE

Sixty-five years ago. They always

said the farm couldn't hold 'em

forever. Looks like you're finally

free, boys.

JAKE

Hey, the dude's holdin'.

LEON

Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers

up.

LEON

Hell of a way to get out. Heard they

burned up in that fire yesterday.

JAKE

I seen the bodies before they sealed

'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good.

Looked like some shit from the X-

Files.

(taking a swig from

the bottle)

Damn, that shit's nasty.

WILLIE

Ray's special recipe. He always had

exacting standards where the hooch

was concerned.

LEON

What were they, bootleggers?

WILLIE

Something like that.

MATCH CUT TO:

BOUNCER

Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's

not happy with you.

RAY

Is Spanky here?

BOUNCER

No, but...

RAY

Then what's the problem?

BOUNCER

Do yourself a favor and find another

place where they let you in the front

door.

RAY

But this is where the action is and

I have to be where the action is.

Look, when your old lady wanted those

alligator shoes, didn't I come through

for you? Ain't she stepping in style

now?

BOUNCER

Yeah...

RAY

Well, alright then. What do you think

about this new tie?

BOUNCER

Sharp.

RAY

I look good tonight. And I feel lucky,

too.

BOUNCER

Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let

you in.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Don't even try it.

RAY

When do you get off?

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

I get off at two, but you ain't never

getting off.

BARKEEP

You can't drink that in here, Ray.

RAY

I sure can't drink that watered-down

swill you're serving. Give me a glass

of ice.

BARKEEP

I can't give you a glass of ice. I

can't give you anything until you

pay your damn tab.

CLAUDE

For the kind of money they charge

here, you'd think they could hire

somebody to actually wash the dishes.

DAISY

Claude. Here's to your new job down

at the bank. I always knew you'd

make something of yourself.

CLAUDE

Know what I'm going to buy with my

first pay check?

CLAUDE

Season tickets to the Yankees. Right

there on the first base line.

(off her disappointment)

What's wrong, baby?

DAISY

I was hoping you were gonna say an

engagement ring, Claude.

CLAUDE

Engagement ring!

DAISY

That's what respectable folks do.

Get a job, get married, start having

babies. That's what you want, isn't

it?

CLAUDE

Sure it is. I just don't see any

reason to rush into things. Damn,

look at this shirt. I'll be right

back.

BAG MAN #1

Congratulations, Claude. We understand

you finally got yourself a job.

BAG MAN #2

Guess that means you can pay Mr.

Riley the fifty bucks you owe him.

CLAUDE

Now wait a second, guys. I've got a

bill to pay out there.

BAG MAN #1

Twenty-two dollars. Not bad for a

start.

CLAUDE

Come on, fellas, that's two weeks

pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta

leave me something.

BAG MAN #2

How about your legs?

CLAUDE

My legs? Those are good, I'll keep

the legs...

RAY

(displeased)

You have any of that French stuff?

ATTENDENT

Here you go.

RAY

Keep the change.

ATTENDENT

Why, thank you, sir!

RAY

Don't I know you?

CLAUDE

I don't think so.

RAY

Sure I do. What's your name again?

CLAUDE

Claude Banks.

RAY

Claude Banks. How could I forget

that? You've got to remember me. Ray

Gibson. We went to high school

together.

CLAUDE

You went to Monroe?

RAY

(beaming)

That's right! Good old Monroe...

CLAUDE

Well, I went to Jefferson, so you

must have a different Claude Banks

in mind.

RAY

Sorry, man. My mistake.

RAY

Watch the threads, Bullethead. If

this is about my tab, I've got it

covered.

BULLETHEAD

This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've

got bigger problems than that.

BOUNCER

Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let

him in here?

CLAUDE

Come on, honey, let's get out of

here.

DAISY

But I'm having a good time...

WAITER

Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot

this.

CLAUDE

The bill. Of course, the bill. We

couldn't leave without paying the

bill. Especially such an incredibly

large bill.

RAY

Save your energy, Claude. You're

gonna need it.

RAY

Here, this belongs to you.

(tossing Claude his

wallet)

It was empty when I found it.

CLAUDE

Good old Monroe.

RAY

What I want to know is what happened

to your cush between the time that

you got up from the table and when I

caught up with you in the Johnny?

CLAUDE

I don't see where that's any of your

business.

RAY

Did those two muscle heads shake you

down? Swear I've seen them down at

the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's

it, ain't it? A gambling debt.

CLAUDE

Where they taking us, anyway?

RAY

Probably to Spanky's headquarters

down at the pier.

CLAUDE

Good, I'm looking forward to meeting

this Spanky. Give me a chance to

straighten out this whole mess.

RAY

I can't wait to see that. You slay

me, man.

CLAUDE

(sotto)

What are they gonna do to us?

RAY

You? Dine and ditch, right?

(Claude nods)

Over ten bucks?

(he nods again)

You're probably looking at a thumb.

CLAUDE

A thumb? What do you mean, like cut

it off? For ten bucks?

(Ray nods)

That include the tip?

SPANKY

(from the darkness)

You picked the wrong night to fuck

with me, Ray. I just lost three men

and a truck full of Canadian whiskey.

You know what that kind of thing

does to my business? It makes me

want to lash out and hurt somebody.

SPANKY

Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?

CLAUDE

I never saw this man before tonight.

He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks

in bathrooms. I'm a professional

man, an upstanding citizen. I go to

church on Sunday.

SPANKY

Then what are you doing here?

BULLETHEAD

Failure to pay.

CLAUDE

(rattled)

Look, Mr. Johnson, you seem like a

reasonable man. I got a good job

starts Monday. I'll pay you back

with my first pay check. With

interest. I don't want to tell you

how to conduct your business, but if

you cut off my finger you won't get

jack. Working an adding machine, I

gotta be whole.

(his fingers dancing

over imaginary keys)

I need my thumbs and all my fingers

for praying and doing good...

SPANKY

The choirboy wants to keep his

fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop

him.

CLAUDE

Drop him? What does drop him mean?

SPANKY

You gotta lotta balls showing your

face around my club. If a man's gonna

run numbers on my side of Broadway,

you think he'd have the common sense

to keep a low profile. But not Ray

Gibson.

CLAUDE

No, not down there! That water's

filthy! Help me out here, man!

RAY

You don't have to drown that fella,

Spanky. You already scared him half

to death. He didn't know who he was

fucking with.

SPANKY

But you do. What does that say about

you, Ray? What does that say about

me? I've given you a lot of leeway

over the years on account of your

father. But he didn't last long enough

to teach you the meaning of the word

respect so I guess I'm gonna have to

school you myself.

RAY

Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to

get by here. You remember how it was

when you were starting out.

CLAUDE

I was supposed to wear this suit on

Monday!

SPANKY

What's that, some of your bathtub

brew?

RAY

Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.

SPANKY

Where'd you get this?

RAY

Comes up the Mississippi. I can get

more. A lot more. I was thinking

about going into business for myself,

but under the circumstances, I'd be

willing to take on a partner.

SPANKY

I'm interested. Keep talking.

RAY

All I need is the front money and a

truck. I could be back in two, three

days tops if I had somebody to share

the driving.

SPANKY

If you fuck me on this one, I'll

spare no expense.

RAY

Understood.

SPANKY

Alright, Ray, you've got a deal.

Pick your man and get going.

RAY

I'll take the little choirboy, if

you don't mind.

SPANKY

If I was you, I'd want somebody who

can handle himself in a tight spot.

RAY

I just want somebody who won't put a

bullet in my back once the truck is

full.

SPANKY

For your sake, I hope you can drive.

Somebody give him some dry clothes.

CUT TO:

RAY

Tell me about that hot sketch you

were hypin' last night. She was a

choice bit of calico. You two been

seeing each other a long time? Gonna

slap the handcuffs on her and stroll

down the aisle one of these days?

RAY

Sometimes I wish I could find me a

sheba to settle down with. Suppose

I'm just a tomcat by nature.

(trying to fill the

silence)

This little rum run is gonna seriously

improve my relationship with Spanky.

He's a good man to have on your side.

He's got the capital and the

connections. That's what you got to

have in that business. Spanky's place

is pretty plush, but one of these

days I'm gonna open up my own

establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

That's in the groove, don't you think?

RAY

Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a

word since we started. Least you

could do is make some friendly

conversation.

CLAUDE

Look, man, I don't want friendly

conversation. I don't want to be

your friend. I've seen your friends

and I don't like them. I just want

to do this thing and get back to New

York in time to start my job.

RAY

Start your job? What kind of job?

CLAUDE

Well, if you must know, bank teller

at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm

responsible for keeping track of

hundreds, occasionally thousands of

dollars.

RAY

That's some long green.

CLAUDE

Damn straight, it is. I got my own

set of keys because I'm supposed to

open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m.

Monday morning, there's gonna be

hell to pay.

CLAUDE

What?

RAY

Nothing.

CLAUDE

No, tell me what's so funny.

RAY

I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds

like ladies work to me.

CLAUDE

Well, maybe I should dig around in

other people's clothes for money.

It's obviously been highly successful

for you.

RAY

Hey, you'd be surprised what you

find in other people's pockets. Just

gotta avoid them deadbeat bank

tellers. Get you every time.

CLAUDE

I didn't start out to be a bank

teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer.

Even had an offer to play short for

the Newark Eagles.

RAY

Why didn't you take it?

CLAUDE

The Negro League don't pay so good.

And you're always on the road. That

don't wash with Daisy.

RAY

You gave up baseball to be a bank

teller? I can't latch on to that.

CLAUDE

At some point a man's got to get

serious about his future. I'm sure

you have no idea what I'm talking

about.

RAY

You're talking about giving up

baseball to be a bank teller.

CLAUDE

Bank teller's just a start. I got

plans. Real plans. Not opening some

Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year

I'll be a loan officer.

RAY

A loan officer?

CLAUDE

That's right, a loan officer.

RAY

So you mean, if I needed some jack

to get my nightclub up and running,

I'd have to hype some square like

you?

CLAUDE

Uh-huh.

RAY

How would I get a loan, anyway?

CLAUDE

You need collateral.

RAY

(re: watch)

Like this?

CLAUDE

That thing? Who'd you steal it from?

RAY

My daddy gave me this watch.

CLAUDE

Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?

RAY

My daddy is dead so watch your mouth.

You can say what you want about me,

but don't be dragging my daddy into

it. This watch means the world to

me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.

CLAUDE

Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!

RAY

Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my

business elsewhere. And for future

reference, you are no longer welcome

at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

CLAUDE

There is no Boom-Boom Room.

RAY

When there is, you can forget about

it. And I swear to God, you ever

talk about my daddy again I'm gonna

kick your bank-telling, loan-denying

ass, you got me?

CLAUDE

Oooh...

RAY

I think I liked you better when you

kept your trap shut.

RAY

Man, something smells good in here.

How's everybody doing?

CLAUDE

(sotto)

Maybe we oughta find another place.

RAY

Are you kidding? Tell me you don't

want a slice of that pie right over

there.

CLAUDE

I must have left my appetite outside,

which is where I think we ought to

be right now.

RAY

Good evening, Billy. We'd like some

coffee and a couple of slices of

that homemade pie you've got

advertised.

BILLY

How you know my name's Billy?

RAY

It says so right there on your shirt.

BILLY

(glancing down)

That what that says?

MAMA

If you boys can read so good, how

come you missed that sign in the

window?

CLAUDE

You mean this sign? The one that

says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a

good question. Ray, how come we missed

the sign?

RAY

Look, ma'am, we've been driving all

day. We'd just like to purchase one

of those pies and we'll be on our

way.

MAMA

Those are whites-only pies.

RAY

Got any nigger pies?

CLAUDE

Any fool could see those are whites-

only, not-for-blacks, come-on-let's-

get-the-fuck-outta-here pies. Thank

you very much.

RAY

(sotto)

Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle

Claude.

CLAUDE

(sotto)

Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a

load of those crackers? Couldn't be

a mouthful of teeth among the bunch

of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight

with people like that for?

RAY

You're soft.

CLAUDE

What'd you say?

RAY

I said you're soft.

CLAUDE

Hey, man, don't ever call me that.

RAY

I call it like I see it, and what I

see is definitely soft.

CLAUDE

Alright. You want some pie?

RAY

Yeah, I want some pie.

CLAUDE

Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to

that counter and get us some fucking

pie.

CLAUDE

Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will

turn that one right there into a

colored pie.

MAMA

And I bet this right here will turn

you into a colored pie.

CLAUDE

Okay, Ray, I think we can go now.

Much obliged...

MAMA

Don't be concentrating so hard, baby.

You're liable to seize yourself again.

RAY

How you doing? We're looking for

Slim.

SLIM

You found him.

SLIM

That's it, fellas. Thirty six cases

of Puerto Rico's finest. At five

bucks a case, that's $180.

RAY

Man, that music is hot. What goes on

down there, Slim?

SLIM

That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.

RAY

Blacks welcome there?

SLIM

Green's the only color that matters

under the hill. They got gambling,

girls. You oughta check it out.

RAY

Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.

CLAUDE

Nice meeting you? You've been here

before, haven't you?

RAY

What gave you that idea?

CLAUDE

Oh, I don't know, maybe because our

lives depend on it, I just sort of

thought you knew what you were doing!

RAY

Don't get all agitated on me. I bought

a bottle of rum from a couple of

dudes, I heard 'em talking...

CLAUDE

Let me get this straight. We drove

all the way down to Klan country

'cause you heard a couple of guys

talking?

RAY

What are you complaining about? It

worked out. Everything's cool. Now,

come on, let's head down there and

see what's shaking. We deserve a

little reward.

CLAUDE

(dubious)

Reward?

RAY

There are people down there having

fun. I want to be one of them. I

want you to be one of them. On Monday

you can be a bank teller if you want,

but tonight you're a bootlegger with

a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and

a fistful of cash.

CLAUDE

That's gas money.

RAY

There's your gas money. You stay

here and watch the truck. And don't

worry, I've got the keys.

CLAUDE

I'm just gonna keep an eye on you,

make sure you don't do nothing stupid.

SYLVIA

I've never seen you in here before.

CLAUDE

(staring at the hand)

That's because I've never been here

before.

SYLVIA

I'm Sylvia. What's your name?

SYLVIA

Can't you remember your own name?

CLAUDE

I know it begins with a "C"...

SYLVIA

Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a

girl a drink?

(to the bartender)

Two bourbons.

CLAUDE

I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an

eye on my friend.

SYLVIA

He looks like he can take care of

himself.

CLAUDE

Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's

never happened before.

SYLVIA

You're cute. You have any money,

Claude?

CLAUDE

Ten dollars. But I need it to get

home.

SYLVIA

Why would you want to go home? It's

so early.

RAY

I'll take two.

WINSTON

I'll see that...

WINSTON

And while we're at it, let's sweeten

the pot.

RAY

Looks like my sugar bowl's empty,

Mr. Hancock.

WINSTON

(reaching for the pot)

That's just too damn bad, ain't it?

RAY

Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through

with you yet.

WINSTON

That'll cover it.

RAY

Full boat, ladies doing the paddling.

WINSTON

Four threes.

WINSTON

Don't take it too hard, New York.

Have a round on me.

WAITRESS

Can I get you something?

RAY

Looks like he had a whole lot of

nothing in his hand until you came

along.

WAITRESS

(wrenching free)

You're hurting my arm.

PIKE

If it isn't Winston Hancock.

PIKE

I thought we agreed that you were

gonna leave town.

WINSTON

I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But

your wife begged me to stay.

PIKE

You just committed suicide, boy.

CLAUDE

Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.

RAY

Here I am.

CLAUDE

Guess we better get going, huh?

RAY

Still got that ten dollars?

CLAUDE

Well, not exactly. See, I met this

girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing

girl. Her name's Sylvia.

RAY

That jelly you were talking to right

here?

CLAUDE

She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs

this operation, and they ain't got

the money for it. Their church took

up a collection but they were still

short...

RAY

So you made a generous contribution.

CLAUDE

What can I say? When the spirit moves

me.

RAY

That was mighty charitable of you,

Claude. Looks like we both got fucked

tonight.

CLAUDE

What are you talking about?

RAY

While you were upstairs doing God's

work, I was getting jack-legged by a

fool with four threes.

CLAUDE

You lost all our money in a card

game?

RAY

He even got my daddy's watch.

CLAUDE

Fuck that cheap-ass watch --

(off Ray's glare)

I mean, how the hell are we gonna

get home without any money?

RAY

We've still got 36 cases of rum.

That's better than money.

CLAUDE

You sure the truck's this way?

(looking over his

shoulder)

I swear it was back that way.

CLAUDE

(croaking)

Ray... Yo, Ray...!

CLAUDE

I think he's hurt pretty bad.

RAY

He's dead.

CLAUDE

Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body

before!

CLAUDE

What do you think you're doing?! The

man's been dead for two seconds!

Don't you have any respect?

RAY

It ain't here.

CLAUDE

What ain't there?

RAY

My daddy's watch. This is the dude I

was telling you about --

MAN WITH LANTERN

What's going on here?

MAN WITH LANTERN

What's wrong with that one?

RAY

Him? He's just drunk.

CLAUDE

Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old

what's-his-name.

RAY

Winston. His name's Winston.

CLAUDE

Come on, Ray, better get Winston

back to the truck.

MAN WITH LANTERN

This fella looks dead.

CLAUDE

Would you look at that, Ray. Winston

up and died on us.

RAY

Hell with him then. If he can't share

the driving, he can't ride in the

truck.

MAN WITH LANTERN

He can ride with us.

MAN WITH LANTERN

So can you.

RAY

Man, this is gonna delay everything.

Spanky's gonna be pissed.

CLAUDE

Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky.

Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a

name is Spanky, anyway? You're

responsible for this situation. I

blame you for everything. If it wasn't

for you, I'd be home having a hot

meal right now.

RAY

If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing

up on the beach at Coney Island right

now.

(mocking Claude)

"I need all my thumbs and fingers

for praying and doing good."

PIKE

What do we have here?

DEPUTY

Billy Bob and the boys found them

down down under the hill with Winston

Hancock. He was dead. Looks like

murder.

PIKE

You don't say.

DEPUTY

Looks like they was running rum. Got

thirty six cases of evidence out

back. You want I should call in the

federal prosecutor?

PIKE

Let's not drag the feds into this. I

can think of better uses for that

rum than letting it collect dust in

some government warehouse up in

Nashville.

PIKE

Besides, why bother with bootlegging

when we got us a clear cut case of

murder?

RAY

Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained

to your associate here, there's been

a mistake. We didn't kill anybody.

Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen

to work for a very important man in

New York.

CLAUDE

That's right. Does the name Spanky

Johnson mean anything to you?

PIKE

Afraid not.

RAY

Mr. Johnson is very well connected.

If you were to let us go, I guarantee

he would show you his appreciation,

if you know what I mean.

PIKE

Are you offering me a bribe?

RAY

I'm just trying to pay the toll on

the road to justice.

PIKE

You may be able to buy your way out

of trouble up in New York City, but

down here we take murder seriously.

CLAUDE

Look, man, how many times we gotta

tell you people, we didn't kill that

guy!

PIKE

Well, if that's the case, then you

don't have anything to worry about,

do you?

PIKE

Time to get home to the missus. See

y'all in the morning.

CLAUDE

The man's gotta point. We're innocent,

after all. I just gotta get a good

night's sleep on this filthy mattress.

Keep our heads on straight, stay

cool, what's the worst thing that

could happen to us?

SMASH CUT TO:

JUDGE

Life!

RAY

Life?! How long is life? We were

just walking back to the truck. We

didn't do nothing! Fuck life!

CLAUDE

Life?! What's life mean? There's no

way I can do life. I got a job starts

Monday morning!

DILLARD (V.O.)

Welcome to the farm. Here you will

be provided with ample opportunity

to repay your debt to society through

the rigors of hard labor...

DILLARD (V.O.)

In between harvest and planting season

we got fields need clearing, roads

need building and ditches need

digging. You will eat only what you

can grow. Your crop don't come in,

you'll go hungry. If you die, don't

worry 'bout us none. We'll find

somebody to replace you...

DILLARD

This here is Camp 8. Camp 8 is for

incorrigibles, so whatever you've

done to get here, believe me, we're

not impressed. You new men are

probably noticing that we have no

fences here at Camp 8. We don't need

no fences, we have the gun line. It

runs from shack to shack clear around

the yard. You are now inside the gun

line. If you step outside the gun

line without my permission, you will

be shot. If you trip and fall over

the gun line, you will be shot. If

you spit, if you pee, if you stick

your ass out and take a dump over

the gun line, you will be shot.

DILLARD

One of my trusties puts a bullet in

you when you're trying to run, I'm

liable to give him a pardon for saving

me the trouble of tracking you down,

so you can bet their aim is true.

DILLARD

My name is Sgt. Dillard. In the

unlikely event that you need to

address me, you call me boss. You

already met this handsome fella right

here. Hoppin' Bob's my ace boon coon.

You run afoul of Hoppin' Bob, you

run afoul of me.

HOPPIN' BOB

New men, strip down!

HOPPIN' BOB

Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat

for ya!

HOPPIN' BOB

We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp

8. Everybody gotta dance eventually.

But don't worry, they won't try

nothing tonight. That would take all

of the fun outta the courtship.

DILLARD

Got three miles of ditch to clear

today. Let's keep it moving!

CLAUDE

I don't believe this before Abe jive.

I didn't go to night school to sing

in no Mississippi Boys Choir!

RAY

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

CLAUDE

Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do

you know, anyway?

RAY

Told ya.

DILLARD

Why ain't his pick swinging?

HOPPIN' BOB

(echoing)

Why ain't that pick swinging?

CLAUDE

It's too hot, boss. I'm tired.

HOPPIN' BOB

He says it's too hot, boss.

DILLARD

Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that

lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi

ain't interested in his meteorological

assessments.

HOPPIN' BOB

Listen up, jiggaboo! State of

Mississippi ain't interested in

your... in your...

(off Dillard's look)

metropolitan assets!

DILLARD

Tell him the state of Mississippi is

only interested in getting this ditch

cleared by sundown.

HOPPIN' BOB

State of Mississippi wants this ditch

cleared by sundown. You got that?!

CLAUDE

I got it... boss.

DILLARD

He don't sound like he's from 'round

here.

HOPPIN' BOB

He's from New York City. That one,

too.

DILLARD

New York. That's up north, ain't it?

They'll find we do things different

down here.

RAY

We noticed.

DILLARD

Looks like we got a couple of live

ones. How long these boys in for?

HOPPIN' BOB

Judge gave 'em the long ride.

DILLARD

Life, huh? They step outta line again,

we'll shorten up that sentence real

fast.

BISCUIT

Drink it up!

POKER FACE

Either of you new fellas know how to

read? I've had this letter four months

now.

CLAUDE

You can't read? None of these guys

can read?

WILLIE

Last fella who could read made parole

'round Christmas.

POKER FACE

I don't even know who this is from.

RAY

Here, gimme that.

RAY

It's from your mama's neighbor, Mrs.

Tidwell. She thought you oughta know

that your second cousin Bo died.

RAY

And your other cousin, Sally, on

your daddy's side, she died.

RAY

Apparently, your sister died.

POKER FACE

Jenny?

RAY

No, it says Marleen here.

RAY

Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died,

too.

RAY

Then it goes on for a while about

how the crop didn't come in on

accounta the frost.

(flips over the page)

She finishes up with something about

a tornado and how your mama and your

daddy died in that. But don't worry

none. She'll take care of the dog.

That is, if it gets over the worms.

POKER FACE

Appreciate it.

RAY

Anybody else need anything read?

JANGLE LEG

How you doin'?

CLAUDE

I'm all right.

JANGLE LEG

You ever done time before?

CLAUDE

You kidding? I've been in and out of

prison my entire life. Mostly in.

I'm hard-core.

JANGLE LEG

Then you won't have no problem making

the adjustment. You need anything,

help of any kind, gimme a holler.

Name's Jangle Leg.

CLAUDE

'Preciate it. Claude.

JANGLE LEG

Soft and supple. Like a lady's.

CLAUDE

(eyes narrowing)

I try to moisturize regularly.

HOPPIN' BOB

(over his shoulder)

Hey, Jangle Leg, what'd I tell you

about pitching woo on the job?

JANGLE LEG

Sorry, Cap'n.

HOPPIN' BOB

Break's over! Back to work!

CLAUDE

Why do you think they call him Jangle

Leg?

RAY

Somebody just told me he wins the

three-legged race every year.

CLAUDE

So?

RAY

He does it all by himself.

RAY

What is that?

COOKIE

Creamed chip beef on toast. Except

we're outta beef, so I had to

improvise.

RAY

Can't I get one of those steaks you

got grilling back there?

COOKIE

Those are for trusties, unless you

got thirty cents or two packs of

cigs.

CLAUDE

Excuse me, I don't like it when the

food touches each other, so if you

could just --

(SPLAT!)

-- keep everything separate.

BISCUIT

Eyes front, mister!

COOKIE

(stepping up)

Problem with the toast?

CLAUDE

It's fine now.

RAY

Stop aggravating people. Just eat

your food.

CLAUDE

This fork is filthy.

RAY

The fork is the least of your worries,

Claude.

RAY

What's your name?

WILLIE

Me? Willie Long.

RAY

What are you in for, Willie?

WILLIE

That's a long story...

RADIO

When he was 13 years old he killed a

son-of-a-bitch with a claw hammer.

WILLIE

They never proved that.

CLAUDE

What a second, you've been in here

since you were thirteen?

RAY

What about you, Radio?

RADIO

Armed robbery.

JANGLE LEG

Damn liar. Bitch killed his sister

with an axe.

RADIO

She was my half-sister. Shit, I ain't

the son-of-a-bitch who poisoned my

own parents.

BISCUIT

(protective)

They deserved it. Very strict.

POKER FACE

What about you, Biscuit? You nearly

skinned your poor old landlady alive.

COOKIE

At least he didn't kill Santa Claus

with his bare hands.

RAY

You killed Santa Claus?

BISCUIT

(scolding)

On Christmas Eve.

POKER FACE

He wasn't the Santa Claus, he was

just wearing the suit and ringing a

bell.

WILLIE

What did you guys do?

RAY

I kinda lost track of how many people

we killed that night. Must have been

15 or twenty -- not counting women

and children. It was a real bloodbath.

All that screaming...

CLAUDE

Pack of lies. Don't listen to him.

We didn't kill nobody. We were

railroaded. And we gonna prove that.

RAY

He just blocked it out. Nigger's

crazy. He's the one who did all the

stabbing. He's capable of some heinous

shit.

(thumbing down the

table)

How 'bout him down there?

WILLIE

Goldmouth? They say he was born out

back behind the shithouse. That's

what they say.

RAY

You all been here a long time. Doesn't

anybody ever escape from this place?

WILLIE

They run but they never get too far.

RADIO

Couple years back, Cookie made it

clear to Greenville.

RAY

Greenville, that the nearest town?

WILLIE

(nodding)

It's a two-day walk if you don't get

lost. Take a mighty cagey country

boy to navigate the woods and bayous

between here and there.

BISCUIT

Those dogs they got can sniff a skid

mark in your underpants from a half-

mile off.

RAY

Alright, well, let's say you make it

to Greenville. What's there, anyway?

COOKIE

Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.

POKER FACE

That's where they nabbed him.

COOKIE

Didn't even get to have my peach

cobbler.

WILLIE

The most important thing they got in

Greenville is a train that heads up

north.

GOLDMOUTH

Hey, girl, you gonna eat your corn

bread?

CLAUDE

No, man. I want you to have it.

RAY

Wait up there, Claude. You give that

guy your corn bread and the next

thing you know you'll be ironing his

shirts and clipping his toenails.

GOLDMOUTH

Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.

RAY

My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I

love corn bread.

RAY

I thought my mama made good corn

bread but this is really something

special.

RAY

Who knew I'd have to come all the

way down to this here prison, deep

in the asshole of the great state of

Mississippi, to find such a tasty

piece of corn bread?

RAY

And who knew that in this great corn

bread-making institution I'd come

face to face with the biggest,

ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold-

mouthed negro in the entire world.

Now get out of my face before I lose

my appetite!

GOLDMOUTH

How you like your corn bread now,

New York?

RADIO

Come on, New York, you can do better

than that! Get up and show him how

they do it in Harlem!

COOKIE

I appreciate you going to all this

trouble over my corn bread. I don't

get a lot of compliments in my line

of work.

WILLIE

Your pal's getting the tar whipped

out of him on your account.

CLAUDE

How many times I got to tell you? He

ain't my pal. Besides, he looks like

he knows what he's doing.

CLAUDE

Alright, alright...

CLAUDE

Hey, Ray, I think you made your point,

whatever that is. Maybe now's a good

time to throw in the towel. You know

what I'm saying?

RAY

(slurring)

Shit, Goldmouth. Back in New York, I

know bitches who hit harder than

you.

WILLIE

The man's taken enough of a beating.

Let's get him inside.

RAY

Got him good, huh, Claude? He won't

be bothering us anytime soon.

BISCUIT

(wagging a finger)

Shame, shame, that's your name.

FADE TO BLACK:

CLAUDE

Request permission to go to the tonk,

boss.

DILLARD

I don't see no wedding ring, Banks.

Conjugal visits are for married

prisoners only.

CLAUDE

You think you could make an exception

just this once, boss? She came all

the way down from New York.

DILLARD

I don't need the Baptists on my back,

but I suppose I could issue a

temporary marriage license for a

nominal fee.

DILLARD

I now pronounce you man and wife.

(calling to the shooter

shack)

Claude Banks going to the tonk!

RAY

Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle

Leg, you think you could squeeze me

in?

BISCUIT

Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit

needs some gravy.

RAY

I'm talking about a haircut.

BISCUIT

Cost you a pair of nylons.

POKER FACE

Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe

me. Ain't it so they got trains up

in New York City that run under the

streets?

RAY

They're called subways. A nickel

will take you from one end of

Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride,

too.

RADIO

Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton

Club?

RAY

Sure I've been to the Cotton Club.

It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold

a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's

where the real action is.

WILLIE

What's the Boom Boom Room?

RAY

That's my joint. The swinginest

nightclub in town.

COOKIE

You got your own nightclub?

RAY

Well, not yet. It's still in the

planning stages.

GOLDMOUTH

So it don't exist.

RAY

Just because it's in my mind,

Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real.

Everything worth anything starts

with a dream.

HOPPIN' BOB

Gibson! Got yourself a visitor!

RAY

Mama?

MAMA GIBSON

Rayford!

RAY

What are you doing here, mama?

MAMA GIBSON

I heard some things so I went to see

Spanky Johnson. He told me what

happened and gave me some money to

get down here. What happened to your

face?

RAY

Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas,

this here is my mama. These are some

of my friends. That's Willie, there's

Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth,

Biscuit, Jangle Leg.

WILLIE

Mrs. Gibson. Shame on Rayford here

for failing to mention that he had

such a beautiful mama.

MAMA GIBSON

Nice to meet you all.

GOLDMOUTH

How was your train ride?

MAMA GIBSON

Quite comfortable, thank you.

COOKIE

Them cookies in there?

MAMA GIBSON

Yes, oatmeal.

RADIO

'Scuse me, you got any batteries on

you?

MAMA GIBSON

No. No I don't.

BISCUIT

That's a lovely dress. Make it

yourself?

MAMA GIBSON

(vaguely unsettled)

Yeah...

RAY

This is a big surprise, mama. I sure

didn't expect to see you down here.

MAMA GIBSON

Rayford, I wanted so much more for

you than this.

RAY

Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so

bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard,

but there's plenty fresh air and

sunshine... And you know something

else, I've taken to going to church

regular. They got services every

Sunday right there in the mess hall.

MAMA GIBSON

Don't you lie to me, Rayford.

(composing herself)

You still have your daddy's watch?

(Ray shakes his head)

Well, this is all I can give you. I

wish it was more.

RAY

I can't take that, mama.

MAMA GIBSON

Don't argue with me. You need it

more than I do. I know how a little

money can help in a place like this.

RAY

I can't believe this. I always said

I'd never end up like this. I thought

I'd make something of myself, do

something with my life. You know, be

successful. Have a big house, a

family. Now I'm gonna end up just

like daddy.

MAMA GIBSON

Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever

say that. He gave up hope. That's

where you gotta be different.

RAY

They gave me life, mama.

MAMA GIBSON

I gave you life. And they can't take

it away from you. Remember that.

You'll get outta here someday. I

believe that. You gotta believe it,

too.

HOPPIN' BOB

(off)

Time's up, Banks! We got a crowd

gathering out here!

CLAUDE

Woman came all the way from New York,

goddamnit! We'll come out when we're

good and ready!

CLAUDE

Did you go see my cousin Maynard

like I asked you in my letter?

DAISY

Of course I did. He said he'd file

an appeal right away. You didn't

tell me he was so good looking.

CLAUDE

Yeah, that side of the family has

all the looks and none of the brains.

I hope he don't mess things up.

DAISY

He seemed like a pretty good lawyer

to me. His offices take up an entire

floor of that big, new building on

125th Street, and he was using all

these words I never heard before. He

even offered me a job.

CLAUDE

A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real

nice. You won't have to work long.

I'll be back soon enough. After I

start work at First Federal Bank of

Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in

style. Everything will get back to

normal again. That's a promise.

DAISY

Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to

know if he should file the appeal on

behalf of your friend, too.

CLAUDE

Ray Gibson?

(thinks about it)

No, no. He's the reason I'm in here,

Daisy. For all I know, he's got a

record a mile long. I got a better

shot of getting out of here on my

own. You tell Maynard to think about

me, concentrate on me. Understand?

DAISY

Sure, Claude, whatever you say.

DILLARD

We lost yesterday on accounta the

rain. That means we gotta make up

for it today, so put your backs to

it.

HOPPIN' BOB

You heard the boss! Let's move!

WILLIE

(squinting at the sun)

Looks like a scorcher.

RADIO

I bet the son of a bitch goes over a

hundred and ten.

POKER FACE

I'll take that action.

WILLIE

Man down, boss!

DILLARD

You two, put him on the truck!

RAY

Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.

CLAUDE

So?

RAY

You know what I'm saying.

CLAUDE

Yeah, I know what your saying. And

I'm saying if you made it that far,

they'd be watching every train that

pulls out of that station.

RAY

That's why we won't take the train.

Cookie showed me where there's a

farm house. They got a boat there.

CLAUDE

What do you know about boats? I bet

you can't even swim.

RAY

What I know about boats is they take

you to freedom. Come on, man. I think

we can do this.

CLAUDE

Why are you always talking about we?

There is no we. There is a me, there

is a you. But there is no we between

us.

HARD CUT TO:

RAY

You want out of this place, don't

you? Don't tell me you're starting

to like it here.

CLAUDE

No, I don't like it here. Look around.

There's nothing but ass. Male ass!

Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm

getting out of here.

RAY

What does that mean?

CLAUDE

Forget it.

RAY

I'm not gonna forget it. What does

that mean? If you've got a plan, I

think I have a right to know about

it. I told you my plan.

CLAUDE

Getting a map from a chubby chef

named Cookie? Dragging our asses

through the swamps in search of some

worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan,

that's a vacation for two in the

hole. When you've got a map to New

York City, you get back to me.

JANGLE LEG

Sure was hot out there today.

COOKIE

Still too hot to sleep.

RADIO

Every bone in my body feel like a

big son-of-a-bitch dog got hold of

it.

GOLDMOUTH

I can't wait 'til Sunday.

CLAUDE

What's so great about Sunday? Monday's

right after it.

RADIO

Hey, Ray, what's the name of that

nightclub of yours?

RAY

You mean the Boom-Boom Room?

RADIO

That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure

would like to see that place when

you get it up and running.

RAY

You should have come by last night,

Radio. You woulda had yourself some

fun.

WILLIE

Last night? What are you talking

about, Ray?

RAY

I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly

blew the roof off the joint.

POKER FACE

Who?

RAY

Satchmo.

GOLDMOUTH

You mean Louis Armstrong?

RAY

He's a good friend of mine. Drops by

the club whenever he's in town.

CLAUDE

Hey, do we have to listen to this

bullshit? I'm trying to get some

sleep around here.

RAY

Yeah, things were hot last night,

but you'll never guess who's playing

tonight.

SMASH CUT:

BISCUIT

A tisket a tasket...

Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

GOLDMOUTH (O.S.)

Hey, Ray...

GOLDMOUTH

Where am I at, man?

RAY

C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta

watch the front door.

WILLIE

Hey, Ray, I could get used to this!

COOKIE

Ray, my man, this steak is like

butter!

How about some steak sauce?

No problem. Oh, boy!

How about some Worchestershire sauce!

And clean that damn table.

Hey, Ray, looks like trouble!

HOPPIN' BOB

I'm sure it don't.

CLAUDE

What's up, Ray?

RAY

(cool)

Claude.

CLAUDE

Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain

later?

RAY

What do you want, Claude?

CLAUDE

What do I want? What makes you think

I want something?

RAY

My daddy always said when a man starts

talking about the weather keep you

hand on your wallet.

CLAUDE

Your daddy must have been a helluva

guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure

wish I could have met him --

RAY

Cut the bullshit. What do you want,

Claude?

CLAUDE

(clearing his throat)

You still got that map?

RAY

Yeah.

CLAUDE

Well, if you're still thinking about

booking it, I want in. I think we

can make it.

RAY

We? Did I hear you say we? As I

recall, you're the one who said there

is no we. Guess we got some bad news

in that letter, huh?

CLAUDE

Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer.

He filed an appeal on my behalf --

RAY

On your behalf. What happened to we?

CLAUDE

The appeal was denied. Then Daisy

went and fell for Maynard. They're

engaged to be married, can you believe

that?

RAY

Well, let's just think about that

for a moment. He's a successful lawyer

up in New York City and you're down

here with a bright future in the

cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny,

miney, Maynard.

CLAUDE

Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm

telling you, you and me, that map,

we can go places.

RAY

You know what, Claude? This whole

time we've been down here, you've

done nothing but think about yourself,

acting like this whole thing is my

fault. That plan with your cousin,

did that include me?

CLAUDE

No.

RAY

At least you're honest for once. So

now you want to be my friend? Well,

let me tell you something, Claude-my-

shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a

lot to learn about friendship.

CLAUDE

Does that mean I'm in?

RAY

I don't think so, Claude. You'd just

slow me down. We'd have to stop every

five minutes so you could polish

your silverware. There's no way around

it, you're soft.

CLAUDE

What'd you say?

RAY

I said you're soft.

CLAUDE

Don't call me that. You know I hate

it when you call me that.

CLAUDE

Damn, that felt good. I should have

done that the first time I met you.

HOPPIN' BOB

Now you girls set aside your

differences and get back to work or

I'll see to it --

RAY

-- we'll spend a night in the hole.

We heard this shit before.

CLAUDE

What the fuck are you laughing about?

HOPPIN' BOB

All in, boss!

DILLARD

Move it out.

HOPPIN' BOB

Movin' it out, boss.

CLAUDE

You did it, man! You got us out!

Next stop, New York City!

New York's a long way's off. Let's

just keep moving, okay?

DISSOLVE TO:

CLAUDE

I know these trees all look the same,

but I'm getting an awful familiar

vibration from this one right here.

You sure you know where we're going?

RAY

Absolutely. The map is very clear.

CLAUDE

Let me take a look at that map.

CLAUDE

You call this a map? What was Cookie

smoking when he drew this?

RAY

Cookie didn't draw it. I did.

CLAUDE

You drew this?!

RAY

I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't

have a map.

CLAUDE

That gripes my soul, man. We're out

here in the middle of nowhere. There

tell me you don't know where we're

going!

CLAUDE

Hey, wait up!

CLAUDE

Come on, Ray, time to go!

RAY

I'm stuck!

Look, daddy. They caught those two

men who escaped last night.

boot. Can you say nigger?

MAE ROSE

Nagger?

ABERNATHY

No, nigger.

MAE ROSE

Nigger.

ABERNATHY

That's my girl.

DILLARD

Here they are, Superintendent. We

tracked 'em all the way to the

ABERNATHY

That's quite a ways. I'm glad you

New York boys could see some of our

lovely countryside while you're down

should we teach these two a lesson?

MAE ROSE

A night in the hole?

ABERNATHY

Better make it a week.

DILLARD

See you in a week, boys.

RAY

Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks

All right, man, just settle down.

We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll

train?

We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred

and Sixty First Street.

Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's

Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers

Red Sox... Who's on the mound?

RAY

I don't know. Who do you want?

CLAUDE

Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.

Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right

here in the program. He's warming up

right now. Man, we're so close to

the field I need cleats. How'd you

get such good seats?

CLAUDE

I know people.

RAY

They must be the right people. Whoa,

there goes the hot dog man. Let's

get a couple. Damn, that smells good.

Nothing like a ballpark hot dog,

huh?

CLAUDE

You get ketchup?

Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot

I can't eat it with mustard.

(off)

You can starve to death for all I

care. Now shut up, the game's about

to start.

CLAUDE

(off)

Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup

today?

RAY

(off)

Of course, he's in the lineup. There

he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!

RADIO

What's going on? Are they alive or

dead?

GOLDMOUTH

Don't look too good.

POKER FACE

They're not moving.

CLAUDE

Hey, Ray...

ABERNATHY

(scowling)

Sergeant Dillard, make sure these

two are out in the fields first thing

in the morning.

DILLARD

Go on, get inside.

DISSOLVE TO:

DILLARD

...Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so

whatever you've done to get here,

believe me, we are not impressed.

You new men are probably noticing

that we have no fences here at Camp

8. We don't need no fences, we have

the gun line. It runs from shack to

shack clear around the yard --

DILLARD

What the hell you think you're doing?

OLD GUY

Excuse me, boss. That kid don't talk.

Something wrong with his head, just

can't get right, boss.

DILLARD

Can't get right, huh? We'll see how

long he last. Now, where was I?

HOPPIN' BOB

We don't need no fences at Camp 8,

boss.

DILLARD

That's right. We don't need no fences,

we have the gun line. It runs from

shack to shack clear around the yard.

You are now inside the gun line...

RAY

(mouthing along)

If you step outside the gun line

without my permission, you will be

shot. If you trip and fall over the

gun line, you will be shot. If you

spit, if you pee, if you stick your

ass out and take a dump over the gun

line, you will be shot...

CLAUDE

I try to teach 'em the finer points

of the game, share my wisdom, but I

don't know why I bother. They don't

listen, they sure don't learn...

RAY

What you're dealing with here is a

complete lack of talent.

CLAUDE

I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the

championship. Every year they get to

roast the victory pig and we get

dick. This year I want that pig.

CLAUDE

Alright, Radio, there you go. Who

wants to hit next?

RAY

You want to hit?

(to Claude)

Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a

shot.

CLAUDE

(skeptical)

Him?

RAY

Can't be worse than any of these

other fools.

CLAUDE

All right, grab the bat. Let's see

what you can do.

CLAUDE

Jangle Leg's gonna throw the ball

nice and easy. You just go ahead and

take a swing.

CLAUDE

Okay. Let's try that again. This

time give it a little juice.

RAY

Told ya.

RADIO

I heard Camp 12 got themselves a son-

of-a-bitch used to pitch for the Mud

Hens.

GOLDMOUTH

That boy got a year for jay-walking.

RAY

Judge must have money riding on the

championship.

CLAUDE

Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the

mound. All I know is when this

season's over Camp 8's gonna have

pork chops.

POKER FACE

Looks like little Mae Rose has grown

up.

BISCUIT

And out.

COOKIE

Mmm-mm, that girl's got gams.

CLAUDE

She's got it all. And it's firm and

round and fully packed.

RAY

You shred it, wheat. That there is

fresh water.

RAY

Be cool, man. You can look, just

don't drool.

ABERNATHY

How was the honeymoon? Am I gonna be

a grandaddy soon?

MRS. ABERNATHY

Don't pay attention to the

superintendent, Tom. You're going to

stay for supper, aren't you?

TOM

Afraid not. I'm shipping out this

afternoon.

POKER FACE

Think you can handle something that

big, Cookie?

COOKIE

I handled your mama, didn't I? Don't

y'all worry. I got plans for that

bad boy. Ain't none of him going to

waste.

DILLARD

Banks! Get over here!

DILLARD

This is Stan Blocker. Scout for the

Nigger Leagues.

BLOCKER

Negro Leagues, actually. Pittsburgh

Crawfords. Ever hear of us?

CLAUDE

We get the games on the radio

sometimes.

BLOCKER

We played down in Jackson yesterday.

Heard a rumor you've got a boy up

here who can hit the ball a ton.

CLAUDE

You probably mean Can't Get Right.

That's him over there.

BLOCKER

Can't Get Right? That's the kid's

name? Can I talk to him?

CLAUDE

You can try, but you won't get too

far. Why you interested?

BLOCKER

Crawford's are always looking for

new talent.

CLAUDE

Maybe you didn't notice, but this is

a prison.

BLOCKER

There are ways around that. Right

sergeant?

BLOCKER

Nice looking squad. See you after

the game.

MRS. ABERNATHY

Of course, the superintendent's hoping

for a boy, but personally, I'd prefer

a girl.

MRS. DILLARD

Whatever it is will be a little gift

from heaven. Look at the way she

glows.

CLAUDE

You're my boy, just keep what little

mind you have focused on the game.

If you hit that ball the way I know

you can, you might just be our ticket

off this farm.

BLOCKER

Mark my words, within five years

there's gonna be a colored man playing

in the majors.

RAY

Come on, the world hasn't changed

that much.

BLOCKER

Maybe not yet. But it will. And I'll

be out of a job. Damn, that's some

tasty hooch.

CLAUDE

It's amazing what Ray here can do

with a couple of pounds of potato

skins and some molasses.

RAY

So, Blocker, what do you think of

our boy?

BLOCKER

I think that boy could be the next

Josh Gibson. I'm gonna talk to the

front office about him, you can bet

on that. Damn, it's getting late. We

got a game in Memphis tomorrow.

CLAUDE

What about us? Don't forget to mention

us.

RAY

We're like his handlers. He can't

function without us.

BLOCKER

I'll put in a good word for you.

You've done a good job with that

boy. Thanks for your hospitality.

ABERNATHY

Uh, doctor...

DOCTOR

She'll be fine. She just had a bit

of a shock.

ABERNATHY

Is Mae Rose okay?

DOCTOR

She's doing just fine.

ABERNATHY

And the baby?

DOCTOR

(vague)

He's a big one.

ABERNATHY

It's a boy! Well, let's get a look

at him.

ABERNATHY

Well, where is he? Where's my new

grandson?

POKER FACE

You really think they'll let him out

of here just to play baseball?

WILLIE

Why not? Boy's got God-given talent.

CLAUDE

God may have given it, but Claude

Banks spotted it and nurtured it.

RAY

Damn straight. I expect those

Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.

CLAUDE

Crawfords.

RAY

Whatever.

COOKIE

(glancing out the

window)

Heads up, here comes trouble.

DILLARD

Alright, listen up! I want every man

lined up out here in the yard on the

double! Let's move it!

HOPPIN' BOB

You heard what the man said! Move

it!

ABERNATHY

I know it was somebody from this

camp. I can feel it in my bones.

ABERNATHY

Do you know who the father of that

little chocolated baby is?

ABERNATHY

Well, then, who is it?

RAY

The baby's mine, boss.

CLAUDE

He's lying, boss. I'm the father of

that baby.

WILLIE

Actually, it was me, boss. I know I

may look old...

BISCUIT

Any fool could see that baby's mine,

boss.

COOKIE

I beg to differ. That cute little

rascal belongs to me...

POKER FACE

I'm the father...

RADIO

I'm the father, boss...

GOLDMOUTH

I'm the father...

JANGLE LEG

I'm the father...

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLIE

To Superintendent Abernathy. May he

have many more grandchildren!

CLAUDE

What I want to know is where? When?

How?

WILLIE

Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't

the type to kiss and tell.

REV. CLAY

There's a sweet fragrance in the air

today.

CLAY'S DAUGHTER

The magnolias are blooming early

this year, daddy.

RAY

Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She

don't mean nothin' to him.

BISCUIT

Hell with him. It ain't that.

RAY

These are free papers.

BISCUIT

(devastated)

What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I

can't go home to my mama like this.

I'll get the strap for sure.

RAY

Come on, Biscuit, this is good news.

Your mama's gonna break down in tears

when you show up on her doorstep.

POKER FACE

(sotto)

I'll give you three to one she gives

him the strap.

RAY

It's 1945. It's a different world

now.

BISCUIT

Not for me, it ain't.

RAY

Well you can't stay here, Biscuit.

This ain't no life for a man. Any

one of these fellas would give their

right arm to be in your shoes. I

sure know I would.

BISCUIT

No life on the inside, no life on

the outside...

RAY

Hey, Biscuit...!

TRUSTY

Man over the line!

DILLARD

Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here!

RADIO

Hey, fellas, I got Chicago.

CLAUDE

Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going?

Why you dressed like that?

RAY

It's a pardon from the governor.

CLAUDE

Let me see that.

CLAUDE

Where'd you get this?

CLAUDE

Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?

BLOCKER

Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.

CLAUDE

Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I

didn't see our names on that pardon.

You said you were gonna put in a

good word for us.

BLOCKER

I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I

mentioned you both. But the fact is,

pardons don't come cheap. The kid

can hit. What can you do?

RAY

Let it go, Claude.

CLAUDE

I'm not gonna let it go. The man

needs to explain himself. Makin'

promises.

BLOCKER

Look, I am truly sorry about this.

I'd like to help you...

CLAUDE

But you can't.

BLOCKER

At least the kid's getting out. Isn't

this what you wanted?

CLAUDE

(resigned)

Yeah. Of course it is.

CLAUDE

You show them Crawfords how to play

ball.

RAY

Make 'em throw strikes.

DILLARD

It's alright. You're a free man now.

BLOCKER

Don't worry, we'll take good care of

him.

RAY

One of the new kids said they're

farming those acres just north of

the swamp. He said he saw a crop

duster flying around the place.

CLAUDE

I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.

RAY

He said they keep it parked out behind

the barn. Can't be that hard to fly

a plane. Lots of people do it.

CLAUDE

They're called pilots! I'm serious,

Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of

your stupid, fucked-up plans right

now.

RAY

I don't see you coming up with any

plans.

CLAUDE

(getting mad)

My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh

right now. That congenital idiot

just got himself a pardon signed by

the governor thanks to us, but we

can't seem to do nothing for

ourselves. Don't you feel a little

disgusted right now?

RAY

Crop duster.

CLAUDE

I ain't getting in no airplane with

you. I'm finally wrapping my mind

around the concept. They threw us in

this shithole for life. Don't you

get it, Ray? We're gonna die here!

Might as well head up to the cemetery,

pick a plot and start digging.

RAY

My daddy died in prison. He gave up

hope and hung himself. What you're

talking about is the same damn thing.

That ain't how I'm going.

CLAUDE

Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray.

Maybe you're just a chip off the old

block.

RAY

Take that back or we ain't friends

no more, Claude Banks.

CLAUDE

Here's a news flash, Ray. We never

were friends. We've just been stuck

together for 12 years. It's been

nothing but bad luck since the moment

I ran into you. Every time I look at

you I get sick to my stomach thinking

about what my life could have been

if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.

RAY

Better watch yourself Claude, before

you say something you regret.

CLAUDE

The only thing I regret is the day I

met you.

RAY

Well, if that's the way it is...

CLAUDE

That's the way it is.

RAY

Then I have nothing left to say to

you.

CLAUDE

You never said nothing of value

anyway.

RAY

Alright Willie, I think I got

everything. I'll talk to Dillard,

see if I can get up to the infirmary

and check up on you. Make sure they're

changing your diapers regular.

WILLIE

They'll be sending you up there soon

enough. And not just for a visit,

neither.

RAY

(leaning in)

I slipped in a couple of bottles of

my latest batch. Help wash down all

them pills they'll be giving you.

YVETTE

(off)

Are you Claude Banks?

CLAUDE

Yeah.

YVETTE

My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me.

You look just like she said.

CLAUDE

She's alright, isn't she?

YVETTE

Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming

today.

CLAUDE

Why not?

YVETTE

She got married last month.

CLAUDE

Married?

YVETTE

Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player.

They moved down to New Orleans.

YVETTE

She always said that if you were on

the outside...

CLAUDE

But I'm not on the outside. I'm in

here.

YVETTE

I know she's sorry she won't be seeing

you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me

to take care of you.

CLAUDE

Take care of me?

YVETTE

You know, go to the tonk or whatever.

CLAUDE

I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm

not much in the mood.

YVETTE

Want me to come back some other time?

CLAUDE

(shaking his head)

Nice girl like you don't belong in a

place like this. But if you talk to

Sylvia, tell her old Claude said

congratulations.

CLAUDE

Whites-only pies...

TRUSTY

Man over the line!

DILLARD

Comfortable?

CLAUDE

As a pair of fur-lined bedroom

slippers, boss.

DILLARD

We'll see what those slippers feel

like after, say, 24 hours. And if

you step down off them bottles -- if

one toe so much as touches the dirt --

one of these boys is gonna shoot you

dead. Let's see. We need a special

man for this job.

DILLARD

How about it, Ray?

DILLARD

I'll make you trusty right now. If

that pie-eatin' son of a bitch falls

off those bottles and you have to

shoot him, I'll see to it you get a

pardon. Hell, I'll personally escort

you out the gate.

RAY

You don't want to give me a gun,

boss. I'm liable to use it on you.

CLAUDE

You're a sucker. I'd have taken that

deal.

RAY

Excuse me? Are you talking to me?

CLAUDE

I'd have knocked you off those

bottles, put a bullet in your ass

and be half way to New York right

now.

RAY

After all these years of blissful

silence, I almost forgot how annoying

the sound of your voice can be.

CLAUDE

I hope you don't think I owe you

anything. Because I don't owe you a

damn thing.

RAY

I didn't do if for you, anyway. I

just ain't no boot-licking trusty,

that's all.

CLAUDE

I was sorry to hear about your mama

passing.

RAY

That was five years ago.

CLAUDE

I know, but since we're talking, I

thought I'd mention it.

RAY

We're not talking, you're talking,

and doing too damn much of it, if

you ask me.

CLAUDE

What?!

RAY

You sure looked funny running for

those pies, bullets flying all around

you.

CLAUDE

Bullets weren't the problem. That

pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.

DILLARD

Fourteen acres today and only 12

hours of daylight! Eat up and move

it out! Gibson! Banks! Get your sorry

asses over here!

DILLARD

Every morning I wake up praying that

Ray Gibson and Claude Banks have

died in their sleep and every morning

you disappoint me.

RAY AND CLAUDE

Sorry, boss.

DILLARD

I stand before you a defeated man.

Try as I might, I can't seem to break

you. I swear, if they dropped a

nuclear bomb on this camp, you and

the cockroaches would be the only

things left. But starting today at

least I won't have to endure your

presence any longer. You've got

fifteen minutes to clear out your

footlockers. You're both being

reassigned to the Superintendent's

mansion. And I, for one, will not

miss you.

RAY

I always wanted to do that.

(sighing)

There is so much love inside of this

man.

CLAUDE

Oh, yard boy, these pansies could

use some attention over here. Perhaps

some fertilizer would restore their

exuberance.

WILKINS

Damn dentures slipping again.

Everything falls apart when you grow

old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches

on.

CLAUDE

Yes, boss.

WILKINS

You know, I'm fixing on retiring at

the end of the summer, gonna try to

enjoy what few years I have left.

What do you think of this place?

It's one of those new retirement

communities down on the Gulf.

CLAUDE

Ocean views, palm trees, two heated

swimming pools and a golf course --

sounds a damn sight better than that

infirmary across the way where I'm

gonna end up.

WILKINS

I apologize, Claude. That was rude

of me.

CLAUDE

That's alright, boss. Takes a lot

more than a colorful brochure to

hurt my feelings.

WILKINS

You been on the farm for quite a

spell, haven't you?

CLAUDE

Over forty years now. Me and Ray

Gibson out there.

WILKINS

Forty years. That's a long time for

any crime, even murder.

CLAUDE

It's a hell of a lot longer when

you're innocent.

WILKINS

Half the men in this prison swear

they're innocent. Don't you think

that's kinda funny?

CLAUDE

You have to forgive me if I don't

laugh.

RAY

You and Wilkins sure are getting

chummy. You two planning on going

steady, or something?

CLAUDE

He's just a lonely old man. He likes

to talk.

RAY

Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to

talk, too. So why don't we start by

talking about what kind of a plan

you're working on?

CLAUDE

I'm not working on a plan.

RAY

You can't fool me, Claude. I know

you got something brewing.

CLAUDE

Goodnight, Ray.

RAY

What the hell are you doing?

CLAUDE

Don't touch that car.

CLAUDE

Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he

asked me to fill in for him.

RAY

You haven't driven in 40 years, you

ain't even got a license. Man's taking

his life in his hands, putting you

behind the wheel! Where you taking

him?

CLAUDE

Greenville. We're picking up the new

Superintendent at the bus station.

WILKINS

You know I trust you, Claude.

CLAUDE

Yes, sir.

WILKINS

I'll be right back.

RAY

(sitting up)

Damn, it was getting hot in there.

CLAUDE

What the hell are you doing in that

trunk?!

RAY

You didn't think I was gonna let you

escape alone, did you?

CLAUDE

I ain't escaping! We're picking up

the new super just like I told you.

RAY

Then you're lucky I came along.

Doesn't take a visionary to spot a

golden opportunity like this. Now

help me out of this trunk.

CLAUDE

You ain't getting out of that trunk.

RAY

Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp

up here.

(Ray struggles out of

the trunk)

We have the chance right here, right

now, I say we go!

CLAUDE

Go where, Ray?

RAY

Back to New York for starters.

CLAUDE

And what will we do when we get there?

I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So

are you. What are we gonna do out

here? Get married, have kids, settle

down? That boat sailed without us,

man.

RAY

This boat's gonna sail without you,

too. I don't care if I last one day

out here. At least it's one day of

freedom. Now gimme those keys.

CLAUDE

Forget about that. You run if you

want to, but you're not taking this

car.

RAY

Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me

those keys.

CLAUDE

I ain't spending a month in the hole

so you can take a joy ride.

RAY

Don't make me take them away from

you.

CLAUDE

Hey, there's Wilkins!

CLAUDE

Who's driving now, bitch?

PIKE

(dropping his bags)

There you go, boy.

WILKINS

Come on, Claude, time to go.

RAY

You sure it was him?

CLAUDE

Some faces you just don't forget.

Warren Pike's is one of 'em.

RAY

I don't like it, I don't like it one

bit. We shoulda taken that car when

we had the opportunity. We'd be half

way to New York by now.

CLAUDE

We'd be in the hole by now. Hey,

man, you're peeing on my shoe.

RAY

I know. Simultaneously, they shake

and zip. Claude bends down and picks

up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a

tray next to an identical one.

WILKINS

Lemonade?

PIKE

I prefer bourbon.

WILKINS

I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor

in the house.

PIKE

Well, fortunately, I carry my own.

WILKINS

Hunting's been pretty good on the

farm the last few years. It's one of

the perks of the job. If you're

interested, tomorrow I could show

you some of my favorite spots.

PIKE

You don't have to twist my arm.

(digging in)

Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.

WILKINS

Thank you, Claude. That'll be all

for tonight.

CLAUDE

Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.

WILKINS

Goodnight, Claude.

PIKE

If you don't mind my saying, you

seem mighty familiar with your house

boy.

WILKINS

I believe in treating the convicts

with respect, if that's what you

mean.

PIKE

(sarcastic)

Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.

WILKINS

If somebody deserves respect, Mr.

Pike, they receive it from me, convict

or no convict.

WILKINS

Well, that's a pretty good haul.

What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to

call it a day?

PIKE

Yeah, it's getting late. I could

sure use a bath.

RAY

That's a real nice watch you got

there, sir. Fancy old thing even

plays a little tune.

PIKE

Yeah, it's special. They don't make

'em like this anymore.

RAY

Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you

got it?

PIKE

Why, my wife gave it to me on our

anniversary some years back.

RAY

Must have been some time ago. Maybe

forty years?

PIKE

(eyes narrowing)

Something like that, yes.

RAY

She give you that scar, too?

PIKE

I oughta shoot you for that comment,

boy.

RAY

Like you shot Winston Hancock?

WILKINS

What's going on here?

PIKE

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach

this uppity nigger a lesson in

manners.

RAY

That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.

CLAUDE

Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in

a lot of trouble.

WILKINS

He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun

and we'll work this out.

RAY

I'm gonna work this man's brains out

the back of his head.

PIKE

Shoot him, Wilkins!

CLAUDE

Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with

this.

(cautiously)

Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot

this white man. See, you do that,

they'll kill you for sure. And it's

not that I like you or anything, but

I've kinda gotten used to having you

around.

RAY

He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I

always knew whoever took that watch

killed Winston Hancock. And that was

you, Mr. Pike.

PIKE

He's crazy. Don't listen to him,

Wilkins.

WILKINS

Do you realize what your saying,

Gibson?

RAY

That watch was the only thing my

daddy ever gave me. It meant the

world to me.

PIKE

Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please

just shoot the nigger!

RAY

He shoots me, I swear I'll take you

with me! I just want to hear you say

it.

WILKINS

Is there any truth to what he's

saying, Pike?

PIKE

What difference does it make? Natchez

was better off without Winston

Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no-

account bootleggers went to jail for

his killing? At least the state of

Mississippi got 40 years of cheap

labor out of the deal!

CLAUDE

Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme

that gun.

RAY

No, I'm gonna kill him --

CLAUDE

No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!

CLAUDE

I can't do it.

RAY

That's because you're soft. Gimme

the gun.

CLAUDE

What'd you say?

RAY

I said you're soft.

CLAUDE

Don't call me soft, I hate it when

you call me that.

RAY

I believe this is mine.

WILKINS

...I was drawing a bead on a bird

when Mr. Pike just stepped into my

line of fire.

DEPUTY #1

Where were the two convicts when the

shot was fired?

WILKINS

They were busy loading up the truck.

We got him back here as quick as

possible, but... I just feel terrible

about this...

CLAUDE

Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?

RAY

He knows nobody wants to hear the

truth.

WILKINS

Well, I think they bought it. One of

the deputies belongs to my church.

WILKINS

I realize there's no way... There's

nothing I can say to make up for

forty years... I'll have Charlotte

prepare those pardon papers right

away.

WILKINS

Claude, mind helping me to the

bathroom?

CLAUDE

(giving him a hand)

Sure, boss.

WILKINS

I'm not your boss. Not anymore.

JAKE

So Ray and Claude got their pardons,

right?

LEON

(smacking him)

No, they didn't get their pardons,

you dumb shit! If they'd got their

pardons way back then, we wouldn't

be burying them today, would we?

JAKE

(chewing on it)

Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get

those pardons?

WILLIE

Old man Wilkins' never came out of

that bathroom. Died right there on

the crapper.

LEON

Just like Elvis.

WILLIE

Of course nobody believed Ray and

Claude.

JAKE

That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.

LEON

What happened to 'em after that,

Willie?

WILLIE

After that? Well, let's see. After

that they got old. We all got old.

RAY

Nurse Humphries was checking my

prostate this morning. I got an

erection.

CLAUDE

An erection, huh? Haven't had one of

those in a while.

RAY

Tell me about it. Scared me at first.

Then, before I could figure out what

to do with it, it was gone. Imagine

my disappointment.

CLAUDE

Sure would like to see the house

that Ruth built one more time.

RAY

Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little

better. Damn thing's falling to

pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.

CLAUDE

What do you expect? It's almost as

old as we are.

RAY

They oughta tear that shit down and

ship them Yankees cross the river to

Jersey.

CLAUDE

Remember what that place looked like

on a sunny spring day? More beautiful

than any church I was ever in.

CLAUDE

Looks like old Jonesy finally got

his walking papers.

RAY

Over to the morgue and up the hill

to the cemetery. Never thought I'd

admit it, Claude, but you were right.

CLAUDE

'Course I was right. About what?

RAY

You're the one who said that

boneyard's the only way we're getting

out of here. We're gonna join all

the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle

Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face,

Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a

plot and start digging...

GANG BANGER #1

Two Percodan.

CLAUDE

I'll raise you.

GANG BANGER #1

What the fuck are those?

CLAUDE

Keeps your cholesterol down.

GANG BANGER #1

I look like I give a shit about my

cholesterol?

GANG BANGER #2

You want a bump, G?

RAY

I wouldn't be putting that shit up

my nose. That came in in somebody's

ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass.

Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't

mine.

WILLIE

Looks like it's up to you, stinky

ass sniffer.

CLAUDE

Thorazine? Well, that's a little

rich for my blood.

CLAUDE

Damn fool gonna set this place on

fire one of these days.

RAY

I got three stool softeners left.

(to Gang Banger #2)

That oughta be right up your alley.

NURSE HUMPHRIES

Who wants Jell-O?

RAY

Hey, where you going? We got money

on the table here!

CLAUDE

You know, Ray, I've been chewing on

what you said this afternoon. I think

I got a plan.

RAY

Are you trying to tell me after all

this time you finally have a plan

for busting out of here?

CLAUDE

Shh! Is that so hard to believe?

RAY

Don't tell me, I don't want to hear

it. It's probably all fucked up,

anyway.

CLAUDE

You don't want to hear it, you don't

want to hear it. There's no shame in

that.

RAY

It's too late for plans.

CLAUDE

Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson

say that. Hell with you then. You'd

only slow me down anyway.

RAY

Hey, man, cover that shit up!

NURSE HUMPHRIES

Is everyone here?

RAY

Hey, where's Claude? I don't see

Claude!

NURSE HUMPHRIES

Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him.

Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?

RAY

He must still be in there.

NURSE HUMPHRIES

Wait for the firemen!

RAY

It'll be too late.

NURSE HUMPHRIES

You can't go in there, Ray! You'll

never make it!

RAY

I'm going in for him. He'd do the

same for me.

BURKE

How did it start?

FIRE INSPECTOR

Probably old wires. The place was a

tinderbox just waiting to go.

BURKE

I guess we should have torn this old

building down a long time ago.

FIRE INSPECTOR

Gibson made it this far before he

was probably overcome by smoke. From

the look of things, Banks never even

made it out of bed.

LEON

Man, you really bummed me out. That's

a terrible story.

(looking at Jake)

Nigger, you crying?

JAKE

Hell, no! I just got something in my

eye.

WILLIE

It's alright for a man to cry once

in awhile. Just don't make a habit

of it.

LEON

Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan,

anyway?

WILLIE

Nothing to it, really. Claude figured

they could steal a couple of bodies

from the morgue. They got a couple

of crackers working there don't know

their asses from their elbows. Then

they was gonna set fire to the

infirmary and make it look like those

bodies was them that got stuck inside.

Claude figured during the commotion,

it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto

one of the fire trucks and hang tight

until it rolled right on out of here

in the morning.

JAKE

What makes you think it didn't work?

WILLIE

I never said it didn't work.

LEON

You trying to tell us that's not Ray

and Claude in those boxes?

JAKE

What do you think about that?

LEON

I think that old man lost his marbles

about a hundred years ago. Come on,

let's get this over with.

FIREMAN #1

(to the room)

Alright, which of you hambones took

our clothes?

CLAUDE

I can't eat this.

RAY

Why the hell not?

CLAUDE

I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom

urinating. He didn't wash his hands.

RAY

Just put some mustard on it and eat

it.

CLAUDE

You didn't get ketchup?

RAY

Gimme that damn thing.

CLAUDE

What am I gonna eat?

RAY

Have my ice cream.

CLAUDE

Thanks.

RAY

Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh,

Claude?

CLAUDE

Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on

fire.

CLAUDE

No, this ain't gonna work either.

It's half chocolate, half vanilla.

RAY

So?

CLAUDE

They're touching.

RAY

If you don't eat that ice cream right

now, I'm gonna strangle you until

you are completely dead.

CLAUDE

Yeah? You and what army?

RAY

Next thing, you're gonna be

complaining about the seats.

CLAUDE

Well, if you must know, they could

be closer.

RAY

Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson

drown you in the river when I had

the chance.

CLAUDE

(glancing around)

I know you're not talking to me...

RAY

I'm sorry, he's on medication...

THE END
