500 DAYS OF SUMMER

Written by

Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber

First Draft

NARRATOR

This is a story of boy meets girl.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New

Jersey, grew up believing that he'd

never truly be happy until the day

he met his... "soulmate."

CUT TO:

4.

NARRATOR

This belief stemmed from early

exposure to sad British pop music

and a total misreading of the

movie, "The Graduate."

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

The girl, Summer Finn of

Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share

this belief.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

Since the disintegration of her

parents' marriage, she'd only loved

two things. The first was her long

blonde hair.

NARRATOR

The second was how easily she could

cut it off... And feel nothing.

CUT TO:

5.

NARRATOR

Tom meets Summer on January 8th in

a San Francisco office building. In

an instant, he will know she's the

one he's been looking for.

NARRATOR

This is a story of boy meets girl.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

You should know up front, this is

not a love story.

PAUL

I didn't know who else to call.

GIRL

You did the right thing. Where is

he?

6.

GIRL

Thomas.

TOM

Rachel? What are you doing here?

GIRL (RACHEL)

I'm here to help you.

TOM

Help me how?

RACHEL

First, put down the plate.

RACHEL

Now come here and sit down.

RACHEL

The key is not to panic.

TOM

I think I'm gonna be sick.

RACHEL

Drink this.

MCKENZIE

What is that?

RACHEL

Vodka.

TOM

(grimacing at the taste)

More.

TOM

Does Mom know you're here? It's

gotta be past 10.

7.

RACHEL

Don't worry about it. Start from

the beginning. Tell us what

happened...

TOM (V.O.)

We spent the whole day together.

TOM (V.O.)

We went shopping.

TOM (V.O.)

We had coffee.

TOM (V.O.)

We saw a film.

TOM (V.O.)

We bought music.

8.

TOM

I thought it was a great day.

RACHEL

And then what happened?

TOM

(to WAITRESS)

Um...you know what...let's go

crazy, I'll have BOTH.

(to Summer)

God, I love eating pancakes at

night. It's like the greatest thing

ever. How great is this?

SUMMER

I think we should stop seeing each

other.

RACHEL

Just like that?

TOM

Just like that.

PAUL

Did she say why?

SUMMER

This thing. This whatever it is.

You and me. Do you think this is

normal?

TOM

I don't know. Who cares about

normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you

happy?

9.

SUMMER

You're happy?

TOM

You're not?

SUMMER

All we do is argue!

TOM

That is such a lie!

RACHEL

Maybe she was just in a bad mood.

PAUL

A hormonal thing.

RACHEL

P.M.S.?

TOM

(to Rachel)

What do you know about PMS?

RACHEL

More than you.

TOM

Oh my god.

MCKENZIE

Please continue.

SUMMER

This can't be a total surprise. I

mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy

for months.

TOM

Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven

times with a kitchen knife. We've

had some disagreements but I hardly

think I'm Sid Vicious.

SUMMER

No... I'm Sid.

10.

TOM

(BEAT)

So I'm Nancy?!

SUMMER

Let's just eat and we'll talk about

it after. I'm starving.

SUMMER

(mouth full)

Mmm, you're so right. These are

great!

SUMMER

(INNOCENT)

What?

SUMMER

Tom, don't. Come back. You're still

my best fr---

PAUL

Jesus.

MCKENZIE

That's harsh.

TOM

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

RACHEL

You're gonna be fine.

11.

TOM

(BEAT)

I'm gonna throw up.

MCKENZIE

Or that.

RACHEL

Here.

MCKENZIE

Come on Hansen. You'll be ok.

You're the best guy I know. You'll

find someone.

PAUL

You know what they say...there's

plenty other fish in the sea.

TOM

No.

PAUL

Sure they do. They say that.

TOM

Well they're wrong. It's not true.

I've fished in that sea. I've

jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm

fucking Aquaman!

(to Rachel)

Sorry. What I mean is... there are

no other fish. This was my fish.

CUT TO:

TOM

I'm in love with Summer.

12.

PAUL

(BEAT)

For real?

CUT TO:

TOM (V.O.)

I love her smile.

TOM (V.O.)

I love her hair.

TOM (V.O.)

I love her knees.

TOM (V.O.)

I love how one eye is higher up on

her face than the other eye.

TOM (V.O.)

I love the scar on her neck from

this operation she had as a kid.

TOM (V.O.)

I love how she looks in my Clash T-

shirt.

TOM (V.O.)

I love how she looks when she's

sleeping.

TOM (V.O.)

I love the sound of her laugh.

13.

TOM (V.O.)

I love how I hear this song every

time I think of her.

CU - TOM, STARING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA.

TOM (V.O.)

I love how she makes me feel. Like

anything's possible. Like, I don't

know...like life is worth it.

CUT TO:

TOM

For real, Paul. I'm madly in love

with that girl.

PAUL

Oh shit.

MCKENZIE

Now I know this may be a little

risque...but if New Hampshire

Greetings wants the jump on those

conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis

at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe

is the wrong approach. The nuclear

family is dead and we need a new

holiday to recognize that.

14.

MCKENZIE

May 21st. Other Mother's Day.

VANCE

Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea

McKenzie. Along with Grossman's

"Magellan Day" I'd say we've got

some potential here. What do you

think Hansen? Could you write up

some prototypes for these?

SUMMER

Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a

call for you on line 3.

VANCE

(to the table)

Everyone this is Summer, my new

assistant. Summer just moved here

from...

SUMMER

Michigan.

VANCE

Right. Michigan. Well, Summer,

everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse

me, I have to take this.

SUMMER

Nice to meet you all.

15.

TOM

What do we know about this new

girl?

MCKENZIE

Who?

TOM

The new girl. Summer. In Vance's

office.

MCKENZIE

Dude. I hear she's a bitch from

hell!

TOM

(DISAPPOINTED)

Really?

MCKENZIE

Patel tried to talk to her in the

copy room. She was totally not

having it.

TOM

Maybe she was just in a hurry.

MCKENZIE

And maybe she's some uppity, better

than everyone, superskank.

TOM

Damn.

MCKENZIE

I know. She's pretty hot.

TOM

That makes me so mad! Why is it

pretty girls always think they can

treat people like crap and get away

with it?

16.

MCKENZIE

Dunno.

TOM

Like, just cause she has high

cheekbones and soft skin...

MCKENZIE

...and really good teeth.

TOM

And maybe the world's most perfect

breasts...Just cause of that stuff,

she can walk around like she's

center of the universe?

MCKENZIE

(as explanation)

Women.

TOM

Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We

haven't even met and I can't stand

her already.

SUMMER

The Smiths.

SUMMER

I love The Smiths.

TOM

Sorry?

SUMMER

I said. I love The Smiths. You have

good taste in music.

17.

TOM

(AMAZED)

You like the Smiths?

SUMMER

(SINGING)

"To die by your side is such a

heavenly way to die." Love it.

TOM

(accidentally out loud)

Oh my god.

TOM

Hi.

SUMMER

Hello.

TOM

So, uh, Summer...

SUMMER

Tom.

TOM

Yeah! How's it going so far?

SUMMER

The city or the firm?

TOM

Both... Either.

SUMMER

I'm happy. Still getting situated.

How long have you worked here?

18.

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

(points to a framed card)

SUMMER

(READING)

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

19.

TOM

Why thank you. That's what they

called me in college. "Perfectly

adequate" Hansen.

SUMMER

They used to call me "Anal Girl."

SUMMER

(EXPLAINING)

I was very neat and organized.

SUMMER

Anyway, I should get back.

TOM

Ok, well, I'll see you around.

TOM

And it turns out she's read every

Graham Greene novel ever published.

Her desk is lined with Magritte

posters and Edward Hopper.

RACHEL

Your favorites.

TOM

We're so compatible it's insane!

Seriously! It doesn't make sense!

She's not like I thought at all.

She's... amazing.

20.

RACHEL

Oh boy.

TOM

What?

RACHEL

You know...just cause some cute

girl likes the same bizarro music

you do doesn't make her "the one."

TOM

(BEAT)

Of course it does.

SARAH (O.S.)

Dinner!

SARAH

Pause and come eat.

TOM

Hey Martin.

RACHEL

He met a girl.

SARAH

(EXCITED)

Yeah?

RACHEL

(GRIM)

Yeah.

SARAH

Oh shit.

CUT TO:

21.

NARRATOR

When one strongly believes in

something, it takes overwhelming

contradictory evidence to change

their minds.

NARRATOR

Tom had always been a devout

believer in the idea of "true

love."

(BEAT)

The evidence did not support him.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner.

22.

NARRATOR

Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson.

TOM

I'm so glad we decided to go away

together Bec. I know we've only

been dating a few months but it's

been...awesome.

NARRATOR

Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles.

TOM

And now, you and me, 8 days in

Mexico... best spring break ever!

REBECCA

I think we should see other people.

23.

NARRATOR

And, finally... Exhibit D: Amanda

Heller.

AMANDA

It's just... it's complicated.

TOM

What's complicated? Last week you

said you loved me!

AMANDA

I know it's sudden but...

TOM

No, this can't be. Everything was

going so great. I don't understand.

AMANDA

(BEAT)

Here.

TOM

What's this?

AMANDA

Because you're, like, the biggest

music nerd I've ever met, I think

this should really help explain

where I'm coming from.

AMANDA

You remember how much I loved this

song when you first played it for

me?

TOM

Sure. It's all you wanted to listen

to for weeks.

24.

AMANDA

Right. And I still like it, don't

get me wrong. It's just... When I

hear it now, I don't feel the

same...rush.

TOM

(still confused)

Ok...

AMANDA

I press the skip button.

TOM

What does this have to do with--?

AMANDA

I'd rather listen to something

else.

TOM

But Amanda... this is a great

fucking song!

TOM

It's off.

PAUL

What?

TOM

Me and Summer.

MCKENZIE

Was it ever on?

25.

TOM

No. But it could have been. In a

world where good things happen to

me.

PAUL

Yeah well, that's not really where

we live.

TOM

No.

MCKENZIE

So what happened?

TOM

You ready for this?

TOM (V.O.)

So there we are. All alone. Nine

more floors to ride. Plenty of

time. I figure...this is my chance.

If not now when, right?

TOM

Summer...

SUMMER

Yeah?

TOM

(BEAT)

So how was your weekend?

SUMMER

It was good.

TOM

You believe that shit?

26.

MCKENZIE

What shit?

PAUL

I think I missed something.

TOM

"It was good." She didn't say "It

was good." She said "It was good."

Emphasis on the good. She basically

said "I spent the weekend having

sex with this guy I met at the

gym." Fucking whore. Screw her.

It's over.

MCKENZIE

What the hell is wrong with you?!

PAUL

Dude, you got problems.

TOM

She's not interested in me. There's

nothing I can do.

MCKENZIE

Based on..."it was good?"

TOM

And some other things.

PAUL

Like what, she said "hey" instead

of "hi" cause that totally means

she's a lesbian.

TOM

I gave her all sorts of chances.

SUMMER

I'm going to the supply room.

Anyone need anything?

MCKENZIE

No thanks.

27.

TOM

I think you know what I need.

TOM

Toner.

SUMMER

Oh ok, sure, no prob.

TOM

Do you want to go out with me?

TOM

And the Priest says, "But we're

already out!"

SUMMER

That is hilarious!

TOM

I know!

TOM

Not once did she take the bait. Not

once. Screw it. I'm done with her.

It's over.

28.

MCKENZIE

This Friday. 10 bucks all you can

karaoke at The Well.

TOM

No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.

MCKENZIE

Come on!

(SINGING)

"Take me down to the paradise city

where the grass is green and they

got big titties!"

TOM

They won't let you back in there

after last time.

MCKENZIE

I wasn't that bad.

TOM

Not at all. You just threw up on

the stage, tried to fight the

bartender, and then threatened to

burn the place down before passing

out on the sidewalk. Quiet night

for you.

MCKENZIE

(REVERENTIAL)

You saved my life that day.

TOM

We are not going back there.

29.

MCKENZIE

This is a work thing, Tommy. It

won't be like that. The whole

office is going.

TOM

I really can't. Even if I wanted

to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta

take care of.

MCKENZIE

You're not listening to me.

TOM

What?

MCKENZIE

The whole office is going.

TOM

Hi.

SUMMER

Hey! They said you weren't coming.

TOM

You asked if I was coming?

(BEAT)

I mean...my plans got cancelled...

MCKENZIE

(already drunk)

Goddamn that song is brilliant!

What's up Hansen?

30.

SUMMER

Ooh that's me.

SUMMER

(into mic)

Ok. I'm the new girl so no making

fun of me.

TOM

You were great up there, by the

way.

SUMMER

Well you can't go wrong with The

Boss.

TOM

(sitting down)

I hear that.

MCKENZIE

Hey, did you know Tom here's from

Jersey?

SUMMER

Yeah?

TOM

Lived there til I was 12.

SUMMER

I named my cat after Springsteen.

TOM

No kidding? What's his name?

31.

SUMMER

Bruce.

TOM

(BEAT)

That makes sense.

MCKENZIE

So you got a boyfriend?

SUMMER

Me? No.

MCKENZIE

Why not?

SUMMER

Don't really want one.

MCKENZIE

Come on. I don't believe that.

SUMMER

You don't believe a woman could

enjoy being free and independent?

MCKENZIE

(BEAT)

Are you a lesbian?

SUMMER

No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not

comfortable being somebody's

"girlfriend." I don't want to be

anybody's anything, you know?

MCKENZIE

I have no idea what you're talking

about.

SUMMER

It sounds selfish, I know, but... I

just like being on my own.

Relationships are messy and

feelings are always getting hurt.

Who needs all that? We're young.

We're in one of the most beautiful

cities in the world.

(MORE)

32.

SUMMER (cont'd)

I say, let's have as much fun as we

can afford and leave the serious

shit for later.

TOM

But...what if you meet someone and

fall in love?

SUMMER

(LAUGHS)

Love? You seriously believe in that

stuff?

TOM

Of course I do.

SUMMER

Interesting. A real romantic.

MCKENZIE

Oh you have no idea. This one...

embarrassing. There was this one

girl,

(to Tom)

I gotta tell this story --

TOM

Summer, hold on... you don't

believe in love?

SUMMER

I don't even know what that word

means. I know I've never felt it,

whatever it is in all those songs.

And I know that today most

marriages end in divorce. Like my

parents.

TOM

Well mine too but --

SUMMER

Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,

there were these scientists who

found that by stimulating a part of

the brain with electrodes you can

make a person fall in "love" with a

rock. Is that the love you're

talking about?

TOM

Well...

33.

SUMMER

Why, what's your take on it?

CUT TO:

BACK TO:

TOM

I think it's...kind of a huge

thing.

SUMMER

(BEAT)

Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to

agree to disagree on that one.

MCKENZIE

So, uh, who's singing next?

SUMMER

(re: singing)

I'd say it's your turn loverboy.

TOM

Nooo. I don't sing in public.

SUMMER

Sure you do. I see you lip-synching

to your headphones every morning on

your way in.

TOM

I don't...

MCKENZIE

You really do.

SUMMER

It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of

self-confidence to look ridiculous.

34.

MCKENZIE

(can't help himself)

Self-confidence! Ha!

TOM

Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough

to sing in front of all these

people.

SUMMER

Ok then. Let's drink.

TOM

It would take at least ten shots to

get me to sing.

SUMMER

Bartender!

TOM

That's not it.

SUMMER

What is that then?

TOM

I have no idea.

SUMMER

I used to watch it every week.

TOM

Me too. Why can't we think of the

stupid A-Team theme song.

SUMMER

Pathetic.

TOM

This is gonna bother me for weeks.

35.

SUMMER

Totally.

MCKENZIE

"And I'd proudly stand UP!"

(aggressive drunk)

I said stand!

TOM

Oh here we go.

MCKENZIE

(to Summer)

This guy.

(DRAMATICALLY)

He's the best.

TOM

Ok, let's get you in a cab.

MCKENZIE

No. I'm gonna walk. I live right

down that street. Or that one.

SUMMER

(LAUGHING)

Is he gonna be ok?

TOM

He'll be fine.

MCKENZIE

Hey.

TOM

What's up?

36.

MCKENZIE

Not you. You.

(beat, to Summer)

He likes you.

TOM

(QUICKLY)

Ok, goodnight McKenzie!

MCKENZIE

I mean... likes you, likes you. For

real. Tell her Tom.

TOM

Sorry you had to see that. Happens

every time we come here. It's

unbelievable. Something about that

guy and singing for people. I don't

know. But at least he didn't --

SUMMER

Is that true?

TOM

What?

SUMMER

You know what. Do you...like me?

TOM

Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.

SUMMER

As a friend.

TOM

Right. As a friend.

SUMMER

Just as a friend?

TOM

Yes. I mean... I haven't really

thought about... Yes. Why?

37.

SUMMER

Nothing. I just... You're

interesting. I'd like us to be

friends. Is that ok?

TOM

Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and

me. That's... perfect.

SUMMER

Cool.

TOM

Cool.

SUMMER

Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.

TOM

G'night Summer.

TOM

(under his breath)

Friends. Awesome. That's just

great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.

38.

SUMMER

Hey!

TOM

Hey!

VANCE.

Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.

TOM

Hey Mr. Vance.

SUMMER

Yes, Mr. Vance?

39.

PAUL

You son of a bitch.

PAUL

Last night, karaoke night?

TOM

(ANXIOUS)

Shhh.

PAUL

The same girl you'd been whining

and crying and bitching about for

weeks now?

TOM

I have not been...

PAUL

The same girl you said was way out

of your league and you'd have no

chance with no matter what. That

girl?

TOM

Paul, seriously...

PAUL

Did you bang her?

TOM

No!

PAUL

Blow job?

TOM

No!

PAUL

Hand job?

TOM

No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still

unemployed. We just kissed.

40.

PAUL

Come on, level with me. As your

best friend, who tolerated a whole

month of talk talk talk about this

girl, nothing but Summer this,

Summer that, Summer Summer Summer,

I mean you were practically

stalking her...

TOM

Shhh!

PAUL

Oh crap.

SUMMER

Hi, I'm Summer..

PAUL

Summer, wow what an unusual name.

I'm sure I'd remember that if I had

heard it before. Tom, how come

you've never mentioned you knew

such a lovely little lady?

(off Tom's nasty look)

Or perhaps you have and I've just

forgot.

(to Summer)

I mean, with all the women in Tom's

life it's hard to keep track...

(not helping)

Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.

SUMMER

Hi Paul.

PAUL

(not sure what else to

SAY)

I'm a doctor.

SUMMER

Nice to meet you.

PAUL

Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I

was never here. Tom, talk to you

later?... Hey, If any jobs open

up...

41.

TOM

If you heard...

SUMMER

Heard what?

TOM

Excellent. You ready to go.

SUMMER

I'm stalking, STARVING!

TOM

(PLAYFULLY)

He exaggerates!

TOM

Check them out.

TOM

(SARCASTIC)

That is hot.

TOM

I am very turned on right now.

SUMMER

Sometimes you can be so judgmental.

TOM

Huh?

42.

SUMMER

I mean, who are you? They're happy.

Just mind your own business.

TOM

9, 9.5?

SUMMER

Too soon to say. It's all in the

dismount.

TOM

If we're lucky, there won't be a

dismount.

SUMMER

I can't believe them. I have like

zero patience for PDA.

TOM

I hear ya. If I want to watch

people make out, I have big windows

and binoculars at home.

SUMMER

Yeah?

TOM

(BEAT)

No. That would be wrong.

SUMMER

This is fun. You're fun.

43.

TOM

Thanks.

SUMMER

I mean, I just want to say, up

front, I'm not looking for anything

serious.

SUMMER

Are you cool with that?

TOM

(UNCONVINCING)

Sure.

SUMMER

It freaks some guys out when I say

that.

TOM

(still confused)

Not me.

SUMMER

Let's just have fun. Let's

just...hang out, no pressure, no

labels, no obligations.

(BEAT)

Ok?

TOM

Sure.

SUMMER

(BEAT)

Wanna hold my hand under the table?

TOM

Yeah.

44.

TOM

I'll be...back in a sec.

TOM

Settle. Don't get too excited.

She's just a girl. There's lots of

them. Who look like that. And like

what you like. They're everywhere.

Calm yourself.

TOM

Are you calm?

(BEAT)

Ok. Then it's time to go back in.

SUMMER

Hi.

TOM

Oh sweet Jesus!

CUT TO:

TOM

(into CAMERA)

I fucking hate Summer.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate her crooked teeth.

45.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate her 1950s haircut.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate her knobby knees.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical,

cock-eyed head.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate that centipede-shaped scar.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate her...stupid...big boobs.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate the way she sleeps.

TOM (V.O.)

I hate the way she laughs.

TOM (V.O.)

I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG!

BUS DRIVER

Son, you're gonna have to exit the

vehicle.

CUT TO:

46.

TOM

It's very... complex.

SUMMER

Complex. Yes.

SUMMER

In a way, it speaks so much by

saying... so little.

TOM

I feel the same way.

TOM

You wanna go to the movies?

SUMMER

(RELIEVED)

God yes!

47.

TOM

A lot of people have problems with

this, but to me, it makes both

structures so much more beautiful

side by side like that.

TOM

The guy who made this, Maybeck, he

is a God.

TOM

It just makes you feel... peaceful.

48.

TOM

No. See now, this is torture.

SUMMER

Why?

TOM

Over there, that's St. Patrick's

church. The beauty of St. Patrick's

is its humility. With this giant

mirror thing deflecting all the

attention away, it's too humble. No

one even knows it's there.

SUMMER

How would you change it?

TOM

There's a million things. First,

there's no need for this much

glass. You could easily...

SUMMER

Show me.

TOM

What?

SUMMER

Don't talk about it. Do it.

TOM

See this beam, it steps on the

landscape. But if we moved it...

just so...

49.

SUMMER

You wanna --

TOM

No you go first.

SUMMER

It doesn't matter to me.

TOM

Whatever you want.

CO-WORKER

Hey Summer. Tom.

BOTH

(like nothing's up)

Hey./ Hi.

SUMMER

(to Co-Worker)

So how's it going?

TOM

Hello?

SUMMER (V.O.)

I remember!

TOM (V.O.)

That's it!

50.

MCKENZIE

Your girl is losing it.

SUMMER

This is not at all as easy as it

looks.

TOM

Ow!

TOM

There's no way.

SUMMER

Why not?

51.

TOM

"Octopus's Garden?" You may as well

just say "Piggies?"

SUMMER

I told you. I love Ringo.

TOM

You're insane.

SUMMER

Why?

TOM

Cause nobody loves Ringo.

SUMMER

That's what I love about him.

(BEAT)

Ooh.

SUMMER

(FLIRTATIOUS)

This got great reviews.

CUT TO:

SUMMER

Is that... possible?

52.

PAUL

So what's going on with you and

Summer?

TOM

I don't know.

PAUL

Is she your girlfriend?

TOM

I wouldn't say that.

MCKENZIE

What would you say?

TOM

Like, are we "going steady?" Come

on, guys. We're adults.

PAUL

It's not an unreasonable question.

Watch. McKenzie, do you have a

girlfriend?

MCKENZIE

No I do not. In fact girls are

repulsed by me. Paul, how about

you?

PAUL

Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is

Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.

TOM

It is when you've been with the

same girl since high school.

PAUL

You've been "seeing" this girl,

what, two months now?

TOM

Something like that.

PAUL

And you haven't discussed it?

53.

TOM

No! She's not... We're not like

that.

PAUL

Like what?

MCKENZIE

Normal.

TOM

We've just been... hanging out.

PAUL

Hanging out?!

TOM

Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we

know how we feel. We don't need to

label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend."

That stuff is very... juvenile.

MCKENZIE

You're so gay.

PAUL

Well let me ask you this then. Do

you want her to be your girlfriend?

TOM

I don't know... Maybe.

MCKENZIE

I heard her Hansen. She's not the

girlfriend type. You're gonna need

to discuss it.

TOM

No. We're adults. It'll be fine.

MCKENZIE

Have you made her a CD yet?

TOM

(BEAT)

Maybe.

MCKENZIE

Oh dude.

54.

PAUL

You really need to have that talk.

RACHEL

You were saying?

TOM

My thinking is... why rock the

boat? Things are going well. If we

start putting labels on it, that's

like the kiss of death. Like saying

to a girl "I love you."

RACHEL

I know what you mean. That's what

happened with me and Sean.

TOM

Who the hell's Sean?

RACHEL

My boyfriend before Mark.

TOM

Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I

need solid female advice.

RACHEL

I'm 12.

TOM

Yeah but, you know me. This is the

kinda stuff that always gets me in

trouble.

55.

RACHEL

Hmm. So, basically you do want to

ask the question, `are we

boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just

afraid you'll get an answer you

don't want and that will shatter

your illusions of how good

everything's been these past few

months. Is that about right?

TOM

(BEAT)

Something like that.

RACHEL

Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse

to get the wrong answer now... or

find out in a month she has a date

coming up with Lars from Norway?

TOM

Who's Lars?

RACHEL

He's a professional surfer with

Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.

TOM

That son of a bitch.

RACHEL

You see what I mean?

RACHEL

Later dude.

TOM

Coach, no, wait! I need her.

(shouting to Rachel)

Rachel, what do you think I should

do?

RACHEL

(calling back)

Just don't be a pussy.

SUMMER

Hi.

TOM

Hi.

SUMMER

Are you ok?

TOM

Yeah.

SUMMER

You sure?

TOM

Summer, I've gotta ask you

something.

SUMMER

Ok.

SUMMER

Wait!

SUMMER

Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk

during this song. It's too

beautiful.

B.M.

"In life I know there's lots of

grief/ but your love is my relief."

CUT TO:

TOM (V.O.)

"So he broke your heart. You've

been sad and depressed for weeks.

Perhaps you've turned to drinking

or even drugs. And nothing's

helped. Now what? Should you binge

on rocky road and watch soaps all

day?"

58.

TOM (V.O.)

"No you should not."

TOM (V.O.)

"Through extensive research, we

have found the six most effective

ways to get over that lost love and

make room in your heart for a new

man to fill. Those steps are:"

TOM (V.O.)

"One. Exercise. The body's release

of endorphins will assuage the

brain and provide a genuine sense

of accomplishment and success."

TOM (V.O.)

"Two. Physical and Mental

relaxation. Channel all of your

energies to the core of your being

for a new understanding of the self

and others."

TOM (V.O.)

"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are

not alone in your pain."

59.

TOM (V.O.)

"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you

know you want to. Indulge!"

TOM (V.O.)

"Five. Travel. Take some time to

see another environment. Get

perspective. It's a beautiful

world. It will be for you again

someday."

TOM (V.O.)

"Six. Redecorate. Start anew."

60.

TOM (V.O.)

"By taking these few steps, you

will have discovered your inner

strength and should be ready to

move on. I bet you can hardly

remember his face at all."

TOM

I just don't get women's fashion

nowadays. Everybody with the

tattoos, the giant hoop earrings,

those annoying hats. Explain this

to me.

SUMMER

People think it looks good.

TOM

Do you?

SUMMER

On some.

TOM

I like how you dress.

SUMMER

Yeah? What if I started wearing

berets and got a huge butterfly

tattoo on my leg?

TOM

(BEAT)

Please don't.

DOUCHE

(to Summer)

Hey.

SUMMER

Hey.

DOUCHE

How's it going?

SUMMER

Ok.

DOUCHE

You live around here?

SUMMER

Yeah not too far.

DOUCHE

I've never seen you here before.

SUMMER

You're not too perceptive.

DOUCHE

Ha. That's funny.

DOUCHE

So, uh, let me buy you a drink.

SUMMER

No thank you.

DOUCHE

Are you with this guy?

62.

TOM

(BEAT)

Hi. I'm Tom.

DOUCHE

Whatever.

(to Summer)

Come on, one drink. What are you

drinking?

SUMMER

Sorry, no thank you.

DOUCHE

You're serious? This guy?

TOM

Hey buddy --

SUMMER

(to the Douche)

Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm

just not interested. Now why don't

you go back over there and leave us

alone, ok?

DOUCHE

It's a free country.

DOUCHE

So you and him, huh? I can't

believe that. Is this guy really

your boyfriend?

63.

CUT TO:

TOM

Did you see that punch? I don't

know where it came from. I haven't

punched someone since Josh

Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm

gonna have to throw out this shirt.

TOM

Hey. What is it?

SUMMER

I can't believe you.

TOM

What?

SUMMER

You were so completely uncool in

there.

TOM

You're mad at me? I just got my ass

kicked for you.

SUMMER

Oh that was for me? You were, what,

protecting me? Next time Tommy,

don't. I fight my own battles.

TOM

Come on, that guy was an asshole!

SUMMER

You didn't have to hit him. Why

didn't you just let me handle it?

TOM

I don't know. He was --

64.

SUMMER

See. This is why I don't want a

serious relationship.

TOM

Whoa. What was that?

SUMMER

Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I

like this. What we've been doing.

But maybe it's gone too...

TOM

What...?

SUMMER

I told you all along what I don't

want and it's...

SUMMER

I'm tired. Can we talk about this

tomorrow?

TOM

(calling to her)

I just got my ass kicked!

TOM

(to Onlookers)

I got one good shot in.

TOM

(GENUINE)

Hi.

65.

SUMMER

(COLD)

Hi.

TOM

What's up?

SUMMER

Nothing.

TOM

Ok.

TOM

Wait, are you still mad at me?

SUMMER

(rolling her eyes)

Tom...

TOM

Holy shit you are. I can't believe

you!

SUMMER

(re: copies)

Are you almost done?

TOM

Yeah. I'm all done.

TOM

You know what... Sometimes you

really don't make any sense.

66.

SUMMER

Say you're sorry.

TOM

Huh?

SUMMER

Say you're sorry for acting like a

jerk.

TOM

I am. I'm sorry for acting like a

jerk.

SUMMER

Ok. Me too.

TOM

Summer... we don't have to label

what we're doing. I just... I need -

SUMMER

I know -

TOM

Consistency. I need to know you

won't wake up tomorrow and feel a

different way.

SUMMER

I can't promise you that. Nobody

can. Anyone who does is a liar.

SUMMER

I can only tell you how I feel

right now... or I can show you.

67.

TOM

Have you ever had a real

"boyfriend?"

SUMMER

What?

TOM

A boyfriend. "Going steady."

Whatever. You know what I mean.

SUMMER

Well... yeah.

TOM

More than one?

SUMMER

A few.

TOM

Tell me about them.

SUMMER

Oh no way.

TOM

Why?

SUMMER

Cause there's nothing to tell.

TOM

Come on, I'm interested.

SUMMER

You wanna have the relationship

history conversation?

TOM

Yes.

SUMMER

You sure about that?

68.

TOM

No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I

can take it.

SUMMER

Ok. Well, in high school, there was

Markus.

TOM

Quarterback slash homecoming king?

SUMMER

He was a rower. Very hot.

TOM

What happened to Markus?

SUMMER

He works for the Republican party.

Very successful. Just not for me.

TOM

Ok. And then?

SUMMER

Well, for a short time in college,

there was Kurt.

SUMMER

That didn't really go anywhere.

(BEAT)

And... my semester in Rome. Daniele

Belardelli. AKA "The Puma."

TOM

The Puma?

SUMMER

Yeah, cause, you know...

69.

TOM

And that's it?

SUMMER

The ones that lasted.

TOM

What happened? Why didn't they work

out?

SUMMER

Nothing happened really. It's what

always happens. Life.

ALISON

So how long have you known Paul and

Robyn?

TOM

Since grade school.

ALISON

No way, really? That's crazy.

TOM

Yeah.

ALISON

Well I'm glad you called. They

spoke very highly of you.

TOM

Great.

ALISON

So...uh... how's it going?

TOM

Ok.

ALISON

You've been pretty quiet.

TOM

Sorry.

ALISON

I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's

nice sometimes to be comfortable

enough that you can just sit and

eat and not have to say anything,

you know?

TOM

Uh-huh.

ALISON

Do you want to try some --

71.

TOM

No thanks.

TOM

I'm sorry. It's just... there's

this girl.

ALISON

Oh.

TOM

I'm not usually like this. I wasn't

before... Long story short, she

wrecked me. I don't know if you can

tell but it was pretty recent and

I'm still kinda thinking about her.

ALISON

(DISAPPOINTED)

Well maybe you should think

about... someone else... who could

cheer you up.

TOM

I can't get her out of my head, you

know? I see her everywhere. She's

all I think about. And it's

horrible. Cause I totally didn't

see it coming. I thought things

were fine. So now I keep going

through every day in my mind, every

second really. Wondering. What went

wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have

prevented it somehow?

TOM

A lot of people have problems with

this, but to me, it makes both

structures so much more beautiful

side by side like that.

72.

SUMMER

While you continue to talk about

buildings and whatever other

bullshit interests you, I'll just

nod my head and pretend to listen

while secretly dreaming about the

many ways I can one day rip out

your heart and eat it like the

rabid vampire I am.

TOM

Maybe there were things I could

have said or done, you know?

ALISON

Waiter!

TOM

Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe

she was never that interested in me

to begin with.

TOM

(BEAT)

How was your weekend?

SUMMER

(winks at him)

It was good.

73.

TOM

Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting

strange, that's why.

ALISON

It's ok. I'm sure it's tough

getting over an ex-girlfriend.

TOM

Actually she was never my

girlfriend.

TOM

I just... I thought I'd have

figured it out by now, you know? My

life. Where I'm going, where I want

to end up, who with. All that

stuff. I still don't know anything.

And the thing is... When I was with

Summer, none of that mattered. I

never even noticed how much of my

life was missing! Isn't that weird?

ALISON

You were in love, that's what it

does. But, now that you know where

the holes are you can start to fill

them.

TOM

Sure.

(BEAT)

Hey, I've been talking non-stop.

You talk.

ALISON

Me? Well I grew up --

TOM

So what do you think? Did I do

something? Did I not do something?

What can I do now?

ALISON

I...

(BEAT)

(MORE)

74.

ALISON (cont'd)

You wanna get out of here? I know

this great...

TOM

(suddenly excited)

Oh! You know what we should do...

TOM

"You said you'd stand by your

man!/So tell me something I don't

understand. You said you loved

me!/And that's a fact! And then you

left me, said you felt trapped!

TOM

"You didn't stand by me! Not at

all! You didn't stand by me," I'm

talking about you Summer!

CUT TO:

75.

SUMMER

Hey it's me.

TOM

Hello me. You having a good day?

SUMMER

I am thank you. Listen, about

tonight... I think I might just

stay in and go to bed early.

TOM

What? Why?

SUMMER

I'm just really tired and I've

gotta go in early tomorrow. Would

you be super mad at me if we went

out this weekend instead?

TOM

Well... You don't want to just,

maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've

gotta eat right?

SUMMER

I'm not really that hungry. And

this place is fancy right?

TOM

(touching his tie)

Sorta.

SUMMER

I'd rather not. Seriously, do you

mind?

76.

TOM

Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you

want to do.

SUMMER

Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow,

alright?

TOM

Sure.

SUMMER

Great. Good night Tom.

TOM

Good night.

(BEAT)

Hey, Happy... birthday.

I just got lucky I guess. We met in

elementary school. We had the same

class schedule in the 7th grade and

we just... clicked.

CUT TO:

MCKENZIE

Love? Shit, I don't know. As long

as she's cute and she's willing,

right? Actually, cute is a strong

word. Not atrocious.

RACHEL

That's a pretty complex question.

Philosophers, poets, scientists,

everybody has a theory, don't they?

(MORE)

77.

RACHEL (cont'd)

I kinda like what Nietzsche said:

"There is always some madness in

love, but there is also...always

some reason in madness." Think

about it. Pretty smart. Although,

Nietzsche also said "Kill the

Jews." So there's that.

VANCE.

I've been happily married for 30

years. She's the light that guides

me home.

(BEAT)

Yes it is from one of our cards.

(BEAT)

No someone else wrote it. Doesn't

make it less true.

SUMMER

Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come

on! We've been fed this nonsense

for generations to the point where

it's now genetically encoded in our

very beings. And what does it mean?

Absolutely nothing. Give me a

break!

MCKENZIE

I'm just saying... I really need

some ass. I'm desperate.

(BEAT)

You got nothing?

PAUL

I wouldn't say "the girl of my

dreams," no. The girl of my dreams

would have a better rack. Probably

different hair, could like sports a

little more. But... truth is...

Robyn's better than the girl of my

dreams.

(BEAT)

You know why? Cause she's real.

78.

MCKENZIE

Hansen, don't you have like twenty

bar mitzvah cards to write?

TOM

Nope. All done. What are you

working on?

MCKENZIE

Congratulations. But I've run out

of ways to say it. "Good job,"

"well done," "way to go"... I got

nothing.

TOM

Why don't you try... "Everyday you

make me proud. But today, you get a

card."

MCKENZIE

(BEAT)

Shit. That's not bad.

TOM

No worries.

79.

TOM

This is good Millie. "To my wife,

the love of my life. I love you."

That's very nice. I was thinking

though, why not try something

like... "Everyday that we don't

meet is meaningless and

incomplete." You know, spice it up

a little.

TOM

Did you try... "Merry?"

ALL

Whoa/Perfect/Yes!

TOM

What else you got?

EMPLOYEE #1

Passover.

TOM

"...aint no woman got what you got,

sista girl. Happy birthday to the

lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha

queen!"

Yeah. It's pretty cool.

You really want to see this?

SUMMER

It sounds amazing.

TOM

It's, like, all stabbing and shit.

SUMMER

Exactly.

TOM

Ok.

All you take me to are sappy little

romances. I want to see some open

wounds, damn it. I want carnage.

TOM

Fantastic.

Oh shit.

What?

Hey!

TOM

(looking at Summer)

Hi Mom.

TOM

Mom, Martin, this is Summer.

SARAH

Summer! Well hello! We've heard so

much about you! It's so good to

finally meet you.

SUMMER

You too.

MARTIN

(to Tom)

Is this the girlfriend?

TOM

Well this is the girl friend I've

told you about. I don't know if

"girlfriend" is the right word...

SARAH

You going to see the serial killer

one?

SUMMER

Yes we are.

SARAH

Great! Should we save you seats?

SUMMER

Absolutely.

82.

SARAH

Ok. We'll see you inside.

TOM

Sorry about that.

SUMMER

It's fine.

TOM

You wanna go do something else? We

can totally bolt.

SUMMER

Did you tell them I was your

girlfriend?

TOM

What?! No way... I never used that

word.

SUMMER

They seemed to think... I mean, why

is your step-dad giving me a hug?

TOM

He's very...loving.

SUMMER

Does he hug all your friends?

CUT TO:

83.

SUMMER

You're not having any fun.

TOM

You're having enough for both of

us.

SUMMER

I'm dancing. I haven't danced in

ages. God. Come on.

TOM

No.

SUMMER

Come on! I wanna dance with you.

TOM

Where were you an hour ago? I might

have danced then. I've been

standing here by myself this whole

time and you didn't look over once.

SUMMER

So you're pissed?

TOM

I'm not pissed. Summer... you know

I hate this shit.

SUMMER

Then why are you here?

84.

TOM

This is what you wanted to do

so...we're doing it.

SUMMER

Yeah well, I didn't need a

chaperone. Go home. You're a

buzzkill standing there pouting.

TOM

(HURT)

That's real nice.

SUMMER

Tom!

85.

TOM

You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?

VANCE

Yes Hansen. Sit down.

TOM

Ok.

VANCE.

Has something happened to you

recently?

TOM

What do you mean?

VANCE

A death in the family, someone

taken ill...anything like that?

TOM

No.

VANCE

Look, I don't mean to pry. Does

this have something to do with

Summer leaving.

TOM

Who?

VANCE.

My assistant.

86.

TOM

(faking badly)

Your...?

VANCE.

Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind.

The reason I'm asking... lately

your work performance has been... a

little off.

TOM

I'm not following.

VANCE

For example, here's something you

wrote last week...

(reads from a card on his

DESK)

"Roses are Red, Violets are Blue.

Fuck You Whore." Now...most

shoppers on Valentine's Day ---

TOM

Mr. Vance... are you firing me?

VANCE

No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're

one of our most... adequate

writers.

TOM

Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me

have been a little difficult.

VANCE

That's ok. I understand that. I was

just thinking... perhaps you could

channel your energy into... this.

TOM

Funerals and sympathy?

VANCE

Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no

reasons to live... it's perfect for

you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now

back to work you go.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Most days of the year are entirely

unremarkable. They begin and they

real impact on the course of a

NARRATOR (V.O.)

May 8th was a Saturday.

TOM

What's going on?

PAUL

We have news.

TOM

Ok.

MCKENZIE

It's about her.

TOM

Do I want to hear it?

PAUL

Thats what we wanted to ask you.

MCKENZIE

It's just...lately you've

been...better.

88.

PAUL

You've been much much better.

MCKENZIE

So maybe it's best we don't ever

bring her up again.

PAUL

Just let sleeping dogs lie.

MCKENZIE

Leave those dogs alone Tom!

TOM

You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate

what you're saying and, thank you,

really, for putting up with me

these past few months. I've been

crazy. But I've accepted the fact

that she and I were just two very

different people who wanted very

different things. I wanted to get

serious. Shit, I loved her. And I

know now, she just isn't the kind

of girl who can settle down with

one person and be happy. The way I

wanted. And she probably never

will. There was nothing I could do.

CUT TO:

TOM

There's no fucking way!

MCKENZIE

Tom.

TOM

It can't be. It's impossible!

PAUL

It is.

MCKENZIE

Do you need anything?

TOM

Twinkies?

MCKENZIE

Sorry.

TOM

I'm out of twinkies.

MCKENZIE

Well let's go.

TOM

Go... where?

91.

MCKENZIE

It's Thursday.

CO-WORKER

This one says "Go for it!"

CO-WORKER

This one says "Don't give up!"

CO-WORKER

And this one says "You can do it!"

We have a whole line of

inspirational cards featuring

Pickles, my cat. I think people

will really enjoy them. Thank you.

VANCE.

Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really

inspirational stuff. Now, who's

next. We haven't heard from

"Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...

TOM

(reacting to his name)

Hmm?

VANCE.

The Winter collection. You have

anything to contribute?

TOM

Uh...no. I really don't.

VANCE.

You have nothing?

92.

TOM

Well I wouldn't say nothing...

Actually, that's about right.

VANCE.

(DISAPPOINTED)

Oh...k. We'll come back to you.

McKenzie --

TOM

You know what...?

VANCE.

Yes Tom.

TOM

Can I say something about the cat?

VANCE

Well sure. Go ahead.

TOM

This here is, and Rhoda, you know I

mean no disrespect... but this...

this is total shit.

MCKENZIE

Tom!

TOM

"Don't give up?" "You can do it?"

TOM

This isn't inspirational. It's

suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm

writing a sympathy card for that

cat. That's the last thing I want

to be doing with my life. It's bad

enough writing these things for

people.

VANCE

Hansen, this is a place of

business. We don't cut down our co-

workers --

TOM

That's cause we're liars! It's what

we do here. Why don't we level with

people? Stop feeding them nonsense?

93.

CO-WORKER (RHODA)

We're a greeting card company.

TOM

Yes but think about it! Why do

people buy these things? Not to say

how they feel. There's paper and

pens for that. People give these

cards when they can't say how they

feel. Or they're afraid to. And we

provide the service that lets `em

get away with that!

TOM

I say to hell with it! Let's level

with America. Or at least make them

speak for themselves! I mean,

seriously, what's this...

(picks a card off the

TABLE)

"I'm sorry to hear your grandmother

has passed." What the hell? Let's

give em some truth. Something like,

"Sorry to hear about your

grandmother. Here's a card so I get

some credit in your time of need.

I'm sure it makes up for the fact

that grandma's dead."

TOM

Think about it.

(picks up another card)

"Congratulations on your new baby."

Eh... How bout... "Congratulations

on your new baby... Guess that's it

for hanging out. Nice knowing ya,

buddy."

VANCE

Hansen, sit down!

TOM

(picks up a card)

Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy!

Look at this one with all the

hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy

Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love

you." Oh that's nice.

94.

MCKENZIE

Tom...

TOM

If someone gave me this card, Mr.

Vance... I would eat it.

MCKENZIE

Tom!

TOM

(BEAT)

It's these greeting cards, Sir,

these cards, these movies, these

pop songs. They're responsible for

all the lies, the heartache,

everything! We're responsible!

TOM

I think we do a bad thing here.

People should be able to say how

they feel, how they really feel,

without some strangers putting

words in their mouths. The truth. A

card is a nice thought but it

shouldn't do the dirty work for

you. You love someone, tell them

yourself, in your own words. Maybe

it's not love at all. Maybe there's

no such thing as love. Maybe

it's... "galoogoo."

(BEAT)

Yeah I made it up, so what?!

TOM

It's all crap. We make and peddle

crap. And sometimes people believe

in this crap. I just can't do it

anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough

bullshit in the world without my

help. I quit.

CUT TO:

TOM

There's no fucking way!

MCKENZIE

Tom.

TOM

It can't be. It's impossible!

PAUL

It is.

TOM

How do you know?

MCKENZIE

We know.

TOM

But... It's May! We broke up last

August.

PAUL

I know.

TOM

And you said she was single at

Christmas.

96.

MCKENZIE

She was.

TOM

And now she's...

MCKENZIE

Yeah.

TOM

Now she's getting married.

PAUL

I'm so sorry Tom.

TOM

Married?

PAUL

It's insane.

TOM

It's impossible. It doesn't make

sense. Where did they meet? Is it

someone we know?

PAUL

No.

TOM

So everything she said. All that

stuff about... it can't be. Not

her. I know her too well. She

wouldn't do that.

TOM

(BEAT)

Fuck!

MCKENZIE

Tom!

PAUL

Let him go.

97.

CUT TO:

RACHEL

Your apple pies are really great.

So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come

AUNT BETSY

TOM

No. Where's that coming from?

AUNT BETSY

We just always wondered.

AUNT ANITA

So how's work?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TOM

Well...glad you came?

SUMMER

Of course. Where am I exactly?

TOM

When you turn 13 in the Jewish

religion, you officially become an

adult.

SUMMER

Wow. So this is a big day in your

sister's life.

TOM

Pretty big, yeah.

SUMMER

(BEAT)

So why aren't you smiling?

RACHEL

Hey brother. Wanna dance?

100.

RACHEL

Hi.

TOM

You having fun? You were great this

morning.

RACHEL

Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are

you?

TOM

Me? I'm good. I'm great.

RACHEL

(re: Summer's engagement)

I heard.

TOM

Yeah.

RACHEL

Sucks.

TOM

Yup.

TOM

Anyway, who cares about me? This is

your day.

RACHEL

You know, my friends... they're all

in love with you.

TOM

Is that right?

RACHEL

Look.

TOM

That's nice.

101.

RACHEL

What I tell ya? There are plenty

other fish in the sea.

TOM

Those are guppies.

RACHEL

Who knows, someday one might turn

out to be your "true love."

TOM

Are you making fun of me now?

RACHEL

No I'm serious.

TOM

I got news for you Rach. That true

love stuff... it's make-believe.

RACHEL

Well that's not very romantic.

TOM

It's the new me.

TOM

Alright... go play with your

friends.

RACHEL

You'll be ok?

TOM

(LYING)

Sure.

RACHEL

Tom.

TOM

Hmm?

RACHEL

I know you think she was the

perfect girl for you...

(BEAT)

I don't. I think you're just

remembering the good stuff. But

what do I know, right? I'm 13.

102.

CUT TO:

TOM

Hey.

SUMMER

Hello?

TOM

Are you still sleeping?

SUMMER

(GROGGY)

I'm getting up. What time is it?

TOM

10:30. Are we still hanging out

today?

SUMMER

Ok. Sure.

TOM

I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20

minutes?

SUMMER

I might need 45.

103.

TOM

So how was last night?

SUMMER

It was fine. Just a work thing.

TOM

Where did you guys go?

SUMMER

Some restaurant.

TOM

Fun?

SUMMER

Uneventful. Didn't get home until

after 12 though which is way too

late for a stupid work function.

How was your night?

TOM

Pretty standard.

104.

TOM

It's playing at 5.

SUMMER

You want to go?

TOM

I don't know. You wanna maybe go

back to your place or ---

SUMMER

I want to see it. Let's go.

TOM

Ok cool.

SUMMER

Unless you don't want to.

TOM

No, I will. That's fine.

SUMMER

Ok.

105.

TOM

Hey.

TOM

Hey Sum, it's just a movie.

SUMMER

I know. I'm sorry Tom.

TOM

Is everything alright with you?

SUMMER

Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm

being ridiculous.

TOM

It's ok. This happens to me every

time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go

for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.

Or go to Sister Ray's.

SUMMER

Ok.

106.

TOM

It pains me that we live in a world

where no one's ever heard of

Spearmint.

SUMMER

I've never heard of them.

TOM

And it's painful. Oh look.

SUMMER

So.

TOM

So... Now what?

107.

SUMMER

Now...I think I'm gonna call it a

day.

TOM

Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some

dinner or something?

SUMMER

I've got pasta at home.

TOM

Are you hungry?

SUMMER

I'm pretty hungry, but --

TOM

Ooh!

SUMMER

What?

TOM

I've got a great idea!

SUMMER

What?

TOM

Let's get breakfast.

SUMMER

Now?

TOM

Pancakes?

108.

109.

SUMMER (V.O.)

Hey.

SUMMER

(re: suit)

Where you coming from?

TOM

What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have

you been sitting there?

SUMMER

Awhile.

110.

SUMMER

I come here a lot. I always loved

this place, ever since you brought

me here.

TOM

So... I should probably say

congratulations.

SUMMER

Probably. But only if you mean it.

TOM

I don't know if I do honestly.

SUMMER

I understand.

TOM

Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're

happy.

SUMMER

You really do?

TOM

(BEAT)

God no.

SUMMER

How are you, Tom?

TOM

I'm good. Ish.

SUMMER

That's good.

TOM

Yeah I quit the office.

SUMMER

Really? That's great! What are you

doing now?

TOM

Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.

111.

TOM

So who's the guy?

SUMMER

Who, my guy?

TOM

Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I

don't want to know.

SUMMER

Tom...

TOM

No really, I don't.

SUMMER

Ok.

TOM

It's amazing to me. You're married.

SUMMER

I know.

TOM

You're not only someone's

girlfriend, your someone's wife!

SUMMER

Pretty crazy, huh?

TOM

(SIGHS)

I'll never understand that.

SUMMER

Tom --

TOM

What's different now? How could

things change so quickly?

SUMMER

I don't know. It just happened.

TOM

What happened?! That's what I don't

get.

112.

SUMMER

I... Tom...

TOM

What, tell me...

SUMMER

I woke up one day and I knew.

SUMMER

I knew I could promise him I'd feel

the same way every morning. In a

way that I... I never could with

you.

TOM

You know what sucks? Realizing that

everything you believe in is

complete bullshit.

SUMMER

What is?

TOM

Destiny, soulmates, true love. All

that stuff. It's nothing more than

silly childhood fairy tale

nonsense, isn't it? God!

SUMMER

Tom, don't go.

TOM

I should have listened to you,

Summer. You were right all along.

SUMMER

I was right?

TOM

What? This is funny?

113.

TOM

What are you laughing at?

TOM

(trying himself not to

LAUGH)

You're a crazy person!

SUMMER

Tom! You're the crazy person!

TOM

What are you talking about?!

SUMMER

One day I'm reading a book at the

corner deli and this guy sits down

and starts asking about it. Now

he's my husband!

TOM

This is funny to you?

SUMMER

What would have happened if I went

to the movies instead? If I went

somewhere else for lunch? If I

showed up to eat ten minutes later?

Tom, it was meant to be, just like

you said. And as it was happening,

I knew it. I could feel it, sure as

the sun. And I kept thinking to

myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."

You were right about all of it.

(BEAT)

It just wasn't me you were right

about.

SUMMER

Anyway, I should probably be

getting back. It was good to see

you. I'm glad you're well.

114.

TOM

Summer!

TOM

I really do hope you're happy.

SUMMER

I know.

(BEAT)

See you later.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

GIRL

Are you here to interview?

TOM

Sorry?

115.

GIRL

Are you interviewing? For the

position?

TOM

Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?

GIRL

Yup.

TOM

Ah. My competition.

GIRL

It would appear.

TOM

Gee, this is a little awkward.

GIRL

Yes it is.

TOM

Well, I hope you don't get it.

GIRL

I hope you don't get it.

TOM

So, uh...

GIRL

Hmm?

TOM

Are you from...California?

GIRL

Grew up not too far from here.

Atherton, near Stanford.

TOM

I know Atherton. Nice area.

GIRL

Have I seen you before?

116.

TOM

I, uh, don't know. I don't think

so.

GIRL

Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to

pray or anything but to stand

outside?

TOM

I do! I love that church. It's like

my favorite structure in the city.

GIRL

If only it wasn't near that

horrible mirrored thing...

TOM

Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!

GIRL

Yeah.

(BEAT)

I think I've seen you there.

TOM

You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see

you.

GIRL

It happens. You probably weren't

looking.

MAN

Tom Hansen?

TOM

Yes.

MAN

Come on back.

TOM

Thank you.

117.

NARRATOR

If Tom had learned anything... it

was that you can't ascribe great

cosmic significance to a simple

earthly event. Coincidence. That's

all anything ever is. Nothing more

than coincidence.

NARRATOR

It took a long time but Tom had

finally learned. There are no

miracles. There's no such thing as

fate. Nothing is meant to be. He

knew. He was sure of it now.

(BEAT)

Tom was...

NARRATOR

...pretty sure.

TOM

(to Girl)

Excuse me.

GIRL

Hello stranger.

TOM

When this is over... uh... would

you like to maybe...grab a cup of

coffee or something?

GIRL

Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet

someone.

TOM

(DEFLATED)

Oh. Got it... No problem.

GIRL

Ok.

118.

TOM

What's that?

GIRL

Why not?

TOM

Yeah?

GIRL

Yeah.

TOM

Great! So... I'll wait for you

here, or you wait for me

or...something.

GIRL

We'll figure it out.

TOM

Ok!

(extends hand to shake)

My name's Tom.

GIRL

Nice to meet you...

GIRL

I'm Autumn.
