SHAME

Written by

Steve McQueen & Abi Morgan

INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN.

BRANDON SULLIVAN [early 30's] lies staring up caught in a

disarray of sheets until-

The PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock, from deep within a

distant apartment.

The MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead-

BRANDON listens then gets up, pulls blinds and heads out

towards the bathroom-

The SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor.

The MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing, in a

far off bathroom.

2   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                    2

BRANDON stands, looking down, watching until-

A SUDDEN breeze, the subway train oncoming-

BRANDON boards.

The doors GLIDE SHUT-

BRANDON just visible through the window of the train, walking

towards a distant seat.

3   INT. TRAIN. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                    3

BRANDON   sits, eyes casually tracing over the faces in the

crowded   train. A HOMELESS MAN sits, further along the car,

haggard   and grey, and sleeping, the seat empty, either side

of him.   He looks more like a pile of clothes.

BRANDON turns back. The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL

caught in the glass opposite.

4   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                                 4

BRANDON padding naked along a corridor. He flicks on an

answer machine in passing-

FEMALE CALLER ON ANSWER MACHINE

Hey...It's me?...Pick Up.. Pick

Up...

He enters the bathroom.

2.

5   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               5

We hear BRANDON peeing in the bathroom.

6   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                               6

The answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the

toilet, the shutting of the door and the shower being

switched on.

7   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                         7

A HOMELESS MAN head lolling, sat alone at the end of a busy

car.

BRANDON considers, catching the eye of-

A PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite, the whisper of a smile,

grazing her lips.

BRANDON's eyes teasing over-

The fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's hair-

The dip in her collarbone-

Her nail polish with French manicure-

BRANDON looks at her. She looks away.

BRANDON resumes staring. She looks back through the bodies

of commuters. We see their eyes looking at each other.

Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and

bodies.

8   INT. OFFICE - BOARDROOM. DAY.                                 8

BRANDON, sits in a packed meeting room, a pitch just audible,

DAVID FISHER, [early/ late 40's] BRANDON's boss, a kind of

white noise, and yet-

DAVID (O.S.)

I find you disgusting..I find you

inconsolable..I find you invasive..

The IT TECHNICIAN just visible wheeling a cart away, with

BRANDON's computer.

DAVID (CONT'D)

That is what the cynics used to

say..Companies would refuse to look

to the future..They'd say `Can we

stop this virus"?

The scratch of a pencil against paper-

3.

BRANDON sits distracted, facing COLLEAGUE #1. MARIANNE

[mid/late 20's] seated further along the table, steals a look

at BRANDON.

A glass door opens-

The PRETTY ASSISTANT brings in coffee, sliding down a cup in

front of BRANDON.

DAVID(O.S.) (CONT'D)

As if it was a negative

progression, a descent into hell,

moving with stealth amongst those

you need to affect, growing more

and more with a momentum that is

unstoppable.

BRANDON looks across the hall, distracted by the IT

TECHNICIAN who is replacing the computer in his office.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Now, some inane kid snorting the

entire load of his mother's spice

cupboard and posts that on You

Tube. They would watch as it would

become the buzzword amongst high

school kids everywhere.

Eventually..their cynicism would

turn to awe.

9   INT. FRONT DOOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                         9

BRANDON to the front door and opens it to reveal an

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (ALEXA)

BRANDON

Hi.

ALEXA

Hi.

BRANDON

Come in.

BRANDON steps aside to let the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in. She walks

into the apartment as he closes the door.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Drink?

ALEXA

No thank you.

4.

ALEXA (CONT'D)

Perfect.

BRANDON

This Way.

DAVID

BRANDON

Yeah, I know. Someone could have

told me.

DAVID

Some kind of Virus.

BRANDON

Cool.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I walk in and it's not there? And I

get some kind of replacement?

DAVID

Some kind of virus. They're

stripping it all out.

BRANDON

Cool.

DAVID (TO BAR TENDER) (CONT'D)

Excuse me, hey, bartender.

Bartender? Can we get four shots of

your finest tequila? Thank you very

much.

ELIZABETH

Hmm.

ELIZABETH sips her drink.

DAVID

I can see you're very successful.

Yeah, I think part of the secret to

my success is, is attention to

detail and..

LOREN

Oh.

ELIZABETH

Detail?

DAVID

Yeah.

LOREN

Play the game.

ELIZABETH closes her eyes

DAVID

What game?

ELIZABETH turns to DAVID

ELIZABETH

Ok, er.. Blue or green?

The SUITED WOMAN closes her eyes, the flutter of her lashes

oddly fragile, in waiting until-

14.

DAVID

I like games, I like this game.

Blue..

(sudden change of tac)

Green. Green, it's green.

They spring open to reveal brown eyes-

DAVID hesitates, throws his arms up, resigned.

DAVID (CONT'D)

That's Brown. That's.. I don't know

how you change the colour of your

eyes like that. How do you do that

so quickly?

ELIZABETH (OVER)

Wow. Wow.

DAVID

That's amazing. That's a real

talent.

ELIZABETH

Yeah, detail man. Detail man.

BRANDON slides down next to DAVID, back from the washroom.

DAVID

Hey buddy, hey buddy. Hey.

DAVID puts an arm around BRANDON.

DAVID (CONT'D)

This guy, right here, fucking

nailed it today. (TO BRANDON) I

want you to know, you fucking

nailed it. You're the man. Your

pitch? (TO ELIZABETH) Amazing.

Amazing. (TO BRANDON) Listen, we're

playing a game here. (TO ELIZABETH)

Close your eyes again.

ELIZABETH

OK

ELIZABETH closes her eyes.

DAVID

Blue or green?

BRANDON

Brown..

The SUITED WOMAN flicks open her eyes, smiles.

15.

DAVID

Fuck Off. (TO LOREN) Alright you.

Hey, Loren. Loren. Close your eyes.

DAVID turns to BRANDON

BRANDON

Blue.

LOREN

Blue.

DAVID

That's... you're just making that

up.

ELIZABETH (OVER)

See. He's good.

DAVID

He's just.. He's just picking

colors randomly.

ELIZABETH

You can have his shot.

ELIZABETH passes BRANDON a shot.

DAVID

You know what? Excuse me. We need

another shot, please.

LOREN

(LAUGHS)

DAVID

(LAUGHS)

ELIZABETH (TO BAR TENDER)

BRANDON

(roaring)

I'll fucking kill you!-

SISSY SULLIVAN [mid/late 20's] leaps out of the bath, naked,

screaming and dripping wet-

SISSY

(screams)

BRANDON

What the.. What the fuck?

SISSY holds her hurt elbow

SISSY

Fuck! Fuck! Ow! Fuck! -

BRANDON (OVER)

Jesus Christ Sissy.

BRANDON stands, shaking staring at his naked startled sister-

SISSY

Brandon. Don't you fucking knock?

BRANDON

What the fuck. Why would I knock? I

live here.

SISSY

Oh fuck.

BRANDON

How'd you get in?

SISSY (OVER)

Ow! You gave me fucking keys.

BRANDON

Fuck.

BRANDON goes for a towel, shoving it towards her,

embarrassed. SISSY dries her face.

SISSY

(GROANS) You fucking scared me

BRANDON

Don't I always say call me first if

you're coming into town?

SISSY (OVER)

Oh my god, I called you SO many

times.

SISSY sighs.

22.

SISSY (CONT'D)

You have a fucking baseball bat?

SISSY (CONT'D)

(LAUGHS) (SIGHS) Mmmm.

What is this shit you put on your

hair? Honestly, it's awful.

BRANDON

Shampoo

SISSY (OVER)

Is it for grooming dogs?

SISSY (CONT'D)

Good to see you.

BRANDON

SISSY

Yeah.

BRANDON

43   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT. MORNING.                         43

24.

SISSY

Morning. Nice earring. Hot date?

Hiding his surprise, BRANDON gets some juice out of the

fridge, passes it to SISSY.

BRANDON

Juice?

BRANDON gives SISSY a carton of juice. Still sitting on the

counter, SISSY grabs it with both hands, almost like a

child's bottle and starts drinking.

SISSY

Mmm.

BRANDON, irritated, says abruptly-

BRANDON

Will you use a glass?

BRANDON steps away, takes a glass from a cupboard and shoves

it towards her.

SISSY

(MUMBLES) Sorry.

SISSY pours the juice into the glass and drinks. BRANDON

steps back to the cooker, preparing food.

SISSY (CONT'D)

(SIGHS) You're going grey. Do you

think I look fat?

BRANDON doesn't react.

SISSY (CONT'D)

Do you think I look fat?

BRANDON nods in the direction of the table.

BRANDON

Sit down.

She leaps off the counter and makes her way to the table. She

slaps BRANDON's behind. BRANDON's face is one of despair and

irritation.

SISSY

(GASPS) Fuck you!

SISSY slams her glass on an O/S table and throws the earring

away.

SISSY (CONT'D)

I'm doing a couple of gigs.

25.

BRANDON walks towards her with a pan of food.

BRANDON

Yeah, sure.

BRANDON serves the food.

SISSY

(sudden/cutting in)

Can I stay?

BRANDON hesitates-

BRANDON

You want toast?

SISSY

Just for a few days.

BRANDON ignores her question and walks away to the kitchen.

SISSY (CONT'D)

I'd stay with Mark but he's being a

fucking asshole.

SISSY Stands and walks away, following BRANDON.

BRANDON

Mark?

SISSY wraps her arms around BRANDON from behind.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

(EXHALES) Jesus, Sissy.

BRANDON pushes her arms off, turns and walks to the fridge

with the juice.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

What do you expect?

SISSY

Pretty please?

BRANDON

Look, you get the sofa and you get

your ass off it-

SISSY leaps on his back smothering him with flat lipped

kisses all over his head until-

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Before I leave every morning.

SISSY (OVER)

(GASPS) I will. I promise. I will

(KISS) Mwah!

26.

BRANDON

OK.OK.OK.OK.

SISSY (OVER)

(KISS) Mwah!

SISSY (CONT'D)

(SIGHS)

BRANDON

We leave in fifteen.

SISSY

OK!

SISSY (CONT'D)

(Reacting to food) Mmm. Mmmm!

(SHOUTS) So good.!

44   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. MORNING.                              44

BRANDON

BRANDON (CONT'D)

SISSY

You have fluff.

BRANDON

I like it there.

27.

SISSY

(LAUGHS)

BRANDON

How are you for money?

SISSY

I'm good.

BRANDON

Cause if you need some money.

SISSY

Honestly, I even make money now and

everything.

BRANDON

Yeah, sure.

SISSY

Huge amounts.

BRANDON nods at SISSY's hat.

BRANDON

Are you collecting mad hats?

Sissy smiles-

SISSY

(LAUGHS) You should come and hear

me.

BRANDON

Yeah. I will.

SISSY

`Yeah I will', like, `yeah I will'

like last time? Please come.

BRANDON takes off her hat.

BRANDON

Where'd you get this, anyway.

SISSY

It's vintage.

BRANDON

Yeah, I can see that.

SISSY

(LAUGHS)

SISSY takes the hat and puts it on BRANDON.

SISSY (CONT'D)

Wow.

28.

BRANDON

(WHISPERS) Do you like?

SISSY

Yeah.

SISSY (CONT'D)

Please come.

BRANDON

Ok. I will.

SISSY

Yaay!

Fuck, my computer.

STEVEN

Well, well, well.

BRANDON

STEVEN

Look who's decided to grace us with

his presence.

BRANDON

Yeah.

29.

STEVEN

Don't tell me. No cabs.

BRANDON

No, your wife wouldn't let me leave

this morning.

STEVEN

Ah! Hey, that's not cool.

BRANDON

(CHUCKLES)

STEVEN

You should be so lucky.

BRANDON

Any calls?

STEVEN

Yes. Like, fifty.

downtown somewhere.

DAVID

She's playing?

BRANDON

She's a musician. Well, she's a

singer.

DAVID

Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what,

that sounds er.. A lot of fun.

(taps coffee mug/walking

away)

And that'll ruin your enamel.

48   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM - COATCHECK. NIGHT.                   48

DAVID

That elevator music's like a bad

acid trip.

HOSTESS (O.S.)

Good evening.

BRANDON

Evening. Er.. Reservation.

Sullivan?

HOSTESS

Great. I have you on the list. I'll

have you follow me.

31.

BRANDON

Thank you.

DAVID (TO COAT CHECK GIRL)

There you are.

HOSTESS

Right this way, please.

DAVID

Oh, wow, look at that ass. I could

DAVID (CONT'D)

Nice pick. (SNIGGERS) (WHISTLES)

49   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM. NIGHT.                                  49

DAVID

Oh. Oh, I forgot how beautiful this

city is.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Oh, thank you, thank you.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Hi guys. How are you both doing

tonight? What can I get you?

32.

DAVID (OVER)

Hi. Your.. Your accent. Are you..?

Are you from erm..?

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Brazil.

DAVID

(looking around)

Rio. Hmmm?

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Sao Paulo.

BRANDON looks down and chuckles to himself.

DAVID

Oh! Oh, that is a beautiful city.

That's..

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

(LAUGHS) You've been there?

DAVID

Once or twice.

BRANDON

Can we get two dry martinis with

olives.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Hm-hm.

DAVID

And a little bit later, why don't

you come by for a drink with us?

Hmm?

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

I'll make sure I get those drinks.

DAVID

Thank you.

BRANDON

Thanks.

The COCKTAIL WAITRESS smiles, moving on, she's heard it all

before.

DAVID smiles, clocks BRANDON's look.

DAVID

She would be offended if I didn't

try.

BRANDON shakes his head and looks down.

33.

BRANDON

Unbelievable.

DAVID (OVER)

Ah. (LAUGHS)

DAVID and BRANDON look around the room

DAVID and BRANDON are fortunate to be here. The clink of

glasses, the noise of laughter waft through the room.

Across the room, a familiar face.

Her wavering a little at first on seeing BRANDON across the

room. Their eyes lock.

She smiles, with quiet surprise-

BRANDON looks away, ignoring SISSY's gaze, not wanting to

look at her. SISSY plays on, inwardly crestfallen, her

fingers working across the piano keys.

DAVID leans back, eyes grazing over SISSY, a kind of white

noise to SISSY's beautiful music-

The seeping first bars of `New York New York' filtering

through-

SISSY

(singing)

Start spreading the news. I'm

leaving today. I want to be a part

of it. New York..New York.

It's a familiar song but in SISSY's hands, every word

punctures like an emotional fireburst-

SISSY's voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of

conversation,

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

I want to wake up in a city that

doesn't sleep. And find I'm king of

the hill, top of the heap.

SISSY's eyes dart back to BRANDON, seemingly lost in his

conversation, but competing now with SISSY and her song-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

My little town blues-

Suddenly SISSY's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body

curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic,

slowly but quietly captivating-

34.

SISSY (CONT'D)

They're melting away. I gonna make

a brand new start of it.

Even DAVID's listening now-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

In old New York....

SISSY's up moving now, she is completely lost in the song and

the room is coming with her-

BRANDON concedes,looking back at SISSY, now holding the room.

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

If I can make it there-

A kind of hushed still has descended-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

I'll make it anywhere. It's up to

you..New york, New york. New York,

New York-

SISSY comes closer, walking between the tables, flirting and

laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the

palm of her hand.

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

I want to wake up in a city, that

never sleeps...And find I'm a

number one-

SISSY grazes past BRANDON's table, eyes catching on BRANDON,

singing for him now-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

Top of the list, king

of the hill-

BRANDON drinks, not looking at SISSY. She closes her eyes,

tears stinging, reeling back into herself-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

A number one...

SISSY draws out the note, bringing the song momentarily to a

silence-

35.

SISSY's misty eyes open as BRANDON at last looks at her, the

moment oddly fragile between them, brutal and yet tender.

Even DAVID sensing something until-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

These little town blues-

SISSY turns, makes her way back to the piano, enjoying it now-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

Are melting away...

Fingers touching the keys once more, masterfully picking up

and improvising with the last few bars-

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

I'm gonna make a brand new start of

it - in old

New York..

SISSY leans back. She is on fire now, singing with every

fibre of her heart and soul, like no other rendition heard.

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

And if I can make it there, I'm

gonna make it

anywhere It's up to you-

SISSY holds BRANDON with a voice, a sudden flickering emotion

threatening to topple her, somehow in SISSY's hands this song

is heartbreaking...

SISSY (CONT'D)

(singing)

New   york New york

(quieter now)

New   York..New York..

(even quieter)

New   york New york

(almost to a whisper)

New   york New york.

SISSY strikes one last note, lost deep within herself-

HUSHED SILENCE-

DAVID

Wow. Wow! Bravo!

Sudden APPLAUSE, CHEERS, OVERWHELMING-

DAVID turns to BRANDON

36.

DAVID (CONT'D)

(LAUGHS) She's good! She's good!

50   INT. BOOM BOOM ROOM. NIGHT.                                  50

DAVID

Hi.

SISSY

Hi.

DAVID

I'm David.

SISSY

Sissy.

DAVI

It's a pleasure to meet you.

SISSY

Nice to meet you.

DAVID (OVER)

I think you were fantastic and you

look great in the dress, too.

Please sit down.

SISSY

Thank you. (TO BRANDON) What did

you think?

BRANDON

Yeah, it was... interesting.

SISSY

(LAUGHS) What do you mean?

BRANDON

Er.. No, it was, er.. It was good.

It was good.

37.

SISSY

It was good?

DAVID

He was crying. He was crying. THere

were tears coming down his face. I

saw it. You made a grown-man cry.

SISSY

Really?

DAVID

Hm-hmm.

BRANDON

I'm gonna get some more drinks.

DAVID

That's a great idea. Why don't you

get a round for the table, buddy?

SISSY (OVER)

Yeah.

Brandon exits.

DAVID

OK, I'm really sorry about that,

I.. He's had a rough day at work. I

think he's a bit emotional right

now.

SISSY

Yeah.

DAVID

Yeah.

(beat)

So you guys grew up in Jersey,

right?

SISSY

Yeah.

DAVID

Hmm. You still live there?

SISSY

GOD, no.

DAVID

That's good. That's good. Where do

you live now?

SISSY

Kind of all over the place.

38.

DAVID

Yeah? What's the last city you've

been to?

SISSY

LA.

DAVID

Los Angeles?

SISSY

Mm-Hmm.

DAVID

Oh boy. You like it there?

SISSY

I mean, I'm going back.

DAVID

That must mean you love it then,

huh?

SISSY

No! I can't even fucking drive.

It's a nightmare.

BRANDON reappears.

DAVID (OVER)

(LAUGHS) Whoa, wait a minute, wait

a minute. You can't drive?

SISSY

No.

DAVID

Why not?

SISSY

I tried when I was a kid, and I was

horrible.

DAVID

Wait, how old were you when you

quit driving.

SISSY

Sixteen.

DAVID

You were 16 years old?

SISSY

Mmhmm.

39.

DAVID

So wait, wait, wait a minute. How

do you get along in Los Angeles?

BRANDON sits behind them.

SISSY

I take the bus.

DAVID

No, no, no, no, no no. Look, look.

DAVID takes SISSY's hand. BRANDON notices, looking

uncomfortable.

DAVID (CONT'D)

A girl like you cannot be taking

the bus.

One of Sissy's sleeves rolls down to her elbow, as she

casually puts her hand under her chin, charmingly tilting her

head - revealing a cross stitch of scars, the trail of self

harm laced up her arm. DAVID noticies.

DAVID (CONT'D)

What.. Waht happened to your arm

here?

SISSY

Oh, just.. When I was a kid I was

bored.

SISSY takes her hand back.

DAVID

Well, you must have been really

bored.

SISSY

I was.

DAVID

Alright, we've got a problem. your

sister cannot be taking the bus

anywhere. OK. I know a guy who owns

a car rental company. We're gonna

get you a car, we're going to drive

around in circles in a parking lot

and you are going to learn how to

drive.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Not a stick, automatic. It's a

little easier.

SISSY

I would love that.

40.

DAVID

You'd love that. That's good. You

know what? Better yet..

DAVID (CONT'D)

We're going to get you a golf cart.

We're gonna get you a gold cart and

you will drive the golf cart

around.

SISSY (OVER)

Wow, now we're talking. I

would..yeah.

DAVID (OVER)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SISSY

Everybody should drive golf carts.

DAVID (OVER)

A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue,

huh? (LAUGHS)

SISSY sips her drink.

SISSY

(LAUGHS) Mmm.

DAVID

You know, they should They should.

It would be a lot cleaner and

greener. It would be great for the

city. Brandon, what do you think?

BRANDON

Sounds great.

DAVID

Yeah?

DAVID looks at BRANDON. BRANDON looks like he would rather be

anywhere than where he is now.

DAVID (CONT'D)

(laughs)

I love your, brother. What an

amazing man. How long are you here

for?

SISSY

I don't know.

DAVID

You don't know? Can I see you

again? Please?

Sissy laughs.

41.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Is that too forward? I just.. I

find you fascinating, I really do.

I think you're a fascinating

creature, I'd love to see you

again.

(beat)

Listen, why don't we.. this is a

celebration, let's have champagne.

SISSY

Yes!

DAVID

Champagne for everybody. For the

whole table. Come on!

SISSY (OVER)

SKYPE SON

SKYPE SON

DAVID's SON exits the computer screen. David looks up at

BRANDON.

DAVID

(LAUGHS) What's up, man?

BRANDON

Well, Steven said you wanted to see

me?

DAVID

Yeah. Er, Dude. Nine o'clock this

morning, where were you?

Oh, shit. Now, what did I tell you

BRANDON

DAVID

Good. Good. You're stinging that

company health care plan, I hope,

right?

BRANDON

Sure.

DAVID

That's what it's there for, man.

Alright brother.

BRANDON turns to leave.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Listen, one more thing.

BRANDON turns back.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Your hard drive is filthy, all

right. We got your computer back. I

mean, it is, it is, dirty. I'm

talking like hoes, sluts, anal,

double anal, penetration, inter

racial facial, man. Cream pie. I

don't even know what that is.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Do you think it was your intern?

DAVID finally looks up, holds BRANDON's gaze, with discreet

challenge until-

BRANDON

(beat)

On my hard drive?

DAVID nods, resumes working-

DAVID

Yeah, someone's fucking with your

account, man.And we're blowing our

wad in cash, you know? It takes a

really really sick fuck to spend

all day on that shit.

BRANDON nods, makes to go.

Hello-

BRANDON

Hello. (LAUGHS)

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Did you find it okay?

MARIANNE

Yes, I'm glad you made it.

BRANDON

Oh, yeah. I'm late. Sorry.

MARIANNE

You look handsome.

BRANDON

You look amazing.

51.

WAITER

Hi.

WAITER places the wine list in front of BRANDON and hands out

menus.

MARIANNE (UNDER)

Thank you.

WAITER

OK.

BRANDON

Thanks.

WAITER

I have few specials on the menu, if

you'd like to hear them?

MARIANNE smiles, eyes darting to BRANDON, playful. The WAITER

oblivious, clearly on a roll.

BRANDON

Sure.

WAITER (O.S.)

Erm.. The soup of the day is tomato

with basil oil and Parmesan

crostini. The special is marinated

swordfish, tabbouleh and Moroccan

Chermoula. It's really good. Er,

we're also serving a DeBragga and

Spitler New York Strip with a side

order of fries and the salad is

snow pea and radish with a cider

vinaigrette. Can I start you off

with a sparkling water?

BRANDON nods, (CLEARS THROAT)-

BRANDON

Tap water's fine.

WAITER

OK and the wine menu's right next

to you. Yep. There you go-

BRANDON pulls out a wine menu hidden under his bread plate.

BRANDON

You want some wine?

MARIANNE

Sure.

BRANDON

White? Red?

52.

MARIANNE

Red maybe..

The WAITER hovers, points to a red on the menu-

WAITER

The Pinot Noir is er..light..

Erm.If you like it like.. Light.

The GLIDE of a napkin across BRANDON's lap, the WAITER a

constant presence, on the edge of irritating.

BRANDON

Great.

WAITER

OK. I'll be back.

The WAITER smiles, at last moves off-

They sit looking at their menus.

BRANDON steals a moment, eyes tracing over-

MARIANNE's fingers playing with the edge of her menu-

The flutter of her lashes-

Nipples ghosting her dress.

An ring indent around her wedding finger, the shrink of skin.

BRANDON

So (CLEARS THROAT) Where do you

live? (LAUGHS)

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS) Brooklyn.

BRANDON

Nice.

MARIANNE

Born and raised. Where you from?

MARIANNE (CONT'D)

Where you from?

BRANDON

I was born in Ireland. We moved

here when I was a teen.

The WAITER enters again, with water.

MARIANNE

Do you get back much? (TO WAITER)

Thank you.

53.

WAITER pours water for MARIANNE

BRANDON

A couple of times.

MARIANNE

A big family? You miss them?

BRANDON

Er.. I have a sister.

MARIANNE

I have two.

BRANDON

Oh, yeah?

MARIANNE

Yeah.

BRANDON

Older, younger?

MARIANNE

Older and younger. I'm in the

middle.

BRANDON stares at MARIANNE

MARIANNE (CONT'D)

What?

BRANDON

Just wondering.

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS) are you nervous?

BRANDON

Why would I be nervous?

MARIANNE smiles, holds his look.

MARIANNE

You look a little nervous.

BRANDON

Do I? No.

MARIANNE

Well, what's a date?

BRANDON shrugs-

BRANDON

It's no big deal.

54.

MARIANNE

It took me an hour to figure out

what to wear.

BRANDON

You chose wisely.

MARIANNE shrugs, smiles-

BRANDON laughs-

The WAITER returns-

WAITER

I forgot to say the crab comes in

the shell.

BRANDON

Great.

The WAITER pauses, expectantly.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Oh. Yeah... I haven't even looked

at this.

MARIANNE

Erm, I'll have the lamb.

The WAITER scrawls it down on a pad, barely looking up.

WAITER

The Lamb.

BRANDON

I'll have the Lamb too. That sounds

great.

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS)

WAITER

Erm, No appetizer?

BRANDON

(looking to MARIANNE)

You want-?

MARIANNE shrugs, closes her menu.

MARIANNE

I'm fine.

BRANDON

No.

55.

WAITER

OK, and how would you like the

lamb?

BRANDON

Medium.

WAITER

We recommend it pretty pink.

The WAITER waits-

BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, they giggle.

BRANDON

OK.

MARIANNE

Hm-hm.

WAITER

Pink it is.

The WAITER takes the menus. MARIANNE stares at BRANDON.

WAITER (CONT'D)

Thank you. Excuse me.

The WAITER exits.

BRANDON

So, you seeing anyone at the

moment?

BRANDON (CONT'D)

No.

MARIANNE

No. Really? Why? Why is that?

BRANDON

I don't know. Just er, it's just

the way it is.

MARIANNE

It's just the way it is. Yeah, I

erm... actually, I'm separated.

BRANDON

Right.

The dip of skin, soft under her chin, a finger grazing over

it, nervously.

MARIANNE

Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.

56.

BRANDON

OK. You were married for long?

MARIANNE

No.

The WAITER returns.

WAITER

Did we decide on the wine?

BRANDON hesitates, on the edge but-

BRANDON

Erm, well, yeah erm.. The Pinot..

Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

BRANDON scours the wine menu at a loss-

BRANDON looks to MARIANNE, she shrugs-

WAITER

Yeah, great..Great choice. OK.

The WAITER nods, at last moves off-

MARIANNE

I wasn't married long. Gave it a

shot. It didn't really work out.

BRANDON

No.

MARIANNE

Wow.

BRANDON

What?

MARIANNE

Well, you just seem, like..

(LAUGHS)

BRANDON

What?

MARIANNE

...averse to the whole idea.

BRANDON

Well, yeah. I mean, I just don't

understand why people would want to

get married. Especially nowadays, I

mean, it's.. You know.. I don't see

the point.

MARIANNE

In relationships?

57.

BRANDON

It doesn't seem realistic.

MARIANNE considers, lips grazing the rim of the glass.

MARIANNE

Are you serious? I mean..

BRANDON

Yeah, I am, really.

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS) Well, then, you know, why

are we here, if we don't matter to

one another?

BRANDON

Well..

MARIANNE

Why are you here?

BRANDON

The food's supposed to be really

great here. (LAUGHS)

MARIANNE nods, doesn't look amused-

BRANDON (CONT'D)

No, no, no, no. I'm not.. I'm not

saying it like that. I mean, I just

mean, you know.. One person for the

rest of your life? I mean, it's.. I

mean, you know, you come to

restaurants, you see couples

sitting together and they don't

even speak to one another. They

don't have anything to say, they

don't have anything.

MARIANNE

They probably don't have to speak

because they're connected.

BRANDON

Or they're just bored with one

another.

MARIANNE

Every..

The WAITER approaches, a bottle of wine in hand.

WAITER (OVER)

Here we go.

The WAITER uncorks the wine.

58.

MARIANNE

What's your longest relationship?

BRANDON

Erm..

MARIANNE

Exactly.

BRANDON

Oh, that's.. you can pour.

WAITER

Sure.

BRANDON

Four months.

MARIANNE

You have to commit. You have to

actually give it a shot.

BRANDON

I did.. (LAUGHS).. For four months.

WAITER (UNDER)

I'll leave the bottle.

MARIANNE

For four months.

68   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                         68

59.

BRANDON sneaks a side glance, MARIANNE smiles. It's freezing.

They're breath and bodies steaming as they walk.

MARIANNE

Thank you.

BRANDON

Look, touch that.

BRANDON bows, pointing to the back of his head.

MARIANNE

Your head?

MARIANNE turns to touch BRANDON's head. As she does so, he

GROWLS at her, like a little dog.

BRANDON

GRRRRRR.

MARIANNE shrieks.

They BOTH laugh.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

(LAUGHS) Oh, no, no, no...

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS) You're such a.. Weirdo.

She pushes him playfully.

BRANDON

No, seriously, seriously. Touch it.

MARIANNE

OK.

There's a massive knot on the back of his head.

MARIANNE (CONT'D)

Oh, my God.

BRANDON

Do you feel that?

MARIANNE

Yeah, what is it?

BRANDON

It's a remnant.

MARIANNE

A remnant?

60.

BRANDON

Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

There's only a few of us left since

the homo sapiens took over.

MARIANNE (OVER)

OK. Hmm.. That would explain the

forehead.

BRANDON

What's that supposed to mean?

MARIANNE

`What's that supposed to mean?'

BRANDON

What do you mean?

MARIANNE

(CHUCKLES) No, seriously, how did

you get it?

BRANDON

(COUGHS) I used to play this game

with my cousin.

MARIANNE

Hm-hmm.

BRANDON

Where I would sit on his feet and

he'd fly me through the air. I hit

my head on the ceiling and I

blacked out.

They both laugh. Marianne laughs hysterically. BRANDON laughs

along.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes.

I peed my pants.

MARIANNE

(Reacts Sympathetically) Oh.

BRANDON

If you had a choice to live in the

past or future and you could be

anything you wanted, what would you

be?

MARIANNE

What would you be?

BRANDON

I always wanted to be a musician in

the sixties.

61.

MARIANNE

That's cool A musician?

BRANDON

Yeah.

MARIANNE

Sixties is tough though. I saw

GIMME SHELTER recently, you know

the Rolling Stones documentary?

BRANDON

Yeah.

MARIANNE

It kind of seemed like hell.

BRANDON

What?

MARIANNE

(LAUGHS) Yeah, the sixties would be

the last place I'd want to be.

BRANDON

No way!

MARIANNE

Yes. Eugh, chaos!

BRANDON

So where would you wanna, and what

would you wanna be?

MARIANNE

Erm.. You know. Here, now.

BRANDON

That's boring

MARIANNE

Fuck you. (LAUGHS)

Still walking along, BRANDON thinks for a moment. BRANDON

turns and stares at MARIANNE, holding his gaze. MARIANNE

blushes. There's a silence as they walk on. They get to a

subway entrance.

MARIANNE (CONT'D)

OK. Well, this is me.

BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet-

BRANDON

This is you.

They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward.

62.

MARIANNE

Thank you very much Brandon.

BRANDON

Thank you very much MARIANNE. We

should do this again.

MARIANNE

Right.

BRANDON

So, is that a yes?

MARIANNE (O.S.)

Maybe, yeah.

64.

SISSY

Oh, you wanna fight? You wanna

BRANDON (OVER)

Yeah? You want some of this? You

BRANDON's towel falls down as he forcefully pins her down.

SISSY (UNDER)

You wanna fight? You wanna fight?

You wanna.

BRANDON (OVER)

What do you want from me? What do

you want from me?

SISSY

BRANDON shakes SISSY by the shoulders. She reacts, upset now.

BRANDON

(SHOUTS) What do you want?

SISSY (OVER)

(SHOUTS) Get off me!

BRANDON

(SHOUTS) Why did you come here?

Why?

SISSY (OVER)

Have you eaten?

BRANDON

No.

SISSY (O.S.)

Are you hungry?

BRANDON

No.

72.

SISSY

Can you just give me a hug?

BRANDON puts him arm around her. She snuggles up to him.

BRANDON

He's not gonna screw you again.

SISSY

(SIGHS).

BRANDON

You left a message didn't you? You

can't help yourself. It's

disgusting.

SISSY

Why are you so fucking angry?

BRANDON

Why am I so fucking angry? That's

my boss! You sleep with him after

twenty minutes and now you're

calling him up? What's the matter

with you? You know he's got a

family, right? You know he's got a

family?

SISSY

No.

BRANDON

You didn't see the wedding ring on

his finger?

SISSY

No.

BRANDON

You're a liar.

SISSY

I'm sorry

BRANDON

You're always sorry.

SISSY

At least-

BRANDON (OVER)

That's all you ever fucking say!

SISSY (OVER)

Well, least I say I'm sorry.

73.

BRANDON

Try doing something, actions count!

Not words.

SISSY

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

I'm not perfect. But I'm...trying.

BRANDON

Some people fuck up all the time.

Pause.

BRANDON removes his arm from around SISSY.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Look, just forget it. This isn't

working out. Obviously. You need to

find somewhere else to live.

SISSY

I don't have anywhere else to go.

(beat)

This isn't about him. I make you

angry all the time and I don't know

why.

BRANDON

No. You trap me. You force me into

a corner and you trap me. "I've got

nowhere else to go." I mean, what

sort of fucking shit is that?

SISSY

You're my brother.

BRANDON

So what, I'm responsible for you?

SISSY

Yes!

BRANDON

No I'm not!

SISSY

Yes you fucking are!

BRANDON (OVER)

I didn't give birth to you! I

didn't bring you into this world.

SISSY

You're my brother, I'm your

sisterm. We're family. We're meant

to look after each other.

74.

BRANDON

You're not looking after me.

SISSY

I'm-

BRANDON (OVER)

I'm looking after myself.

SISSY (OVER)

I'm trying to help you!

BRANDON

How are you helping me? Huh? How

are you helping me?

BRANDON grips SISSY's face in his hand.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

How are you helping me? Huh? Look

at me. How are you helping me? You

come in here, and you're a weight

on me. Do you understand me? You're

a burden. You're just fucking

dragging me down. You can't even

clean up after yourself. Stop

playing the victim.

SISSY

I'm not playing the fucking victim.

If I left now, I'd never hear from

you again.

SISSY pulls BRANDON's hand away.

SISSY (CONT'D)

Don't you think that's sad? Don't

you think that's sad? You're my

brother.

BRANDON

Why is it always so dramatic with

you? Everything is always the end

of the world.

SISSY

It's not fucking dramatic. I'm

trying to talk to you!

BRANDON

I don't want to talk. Try not

talking. Try just listening or

thinking for a change.

SISSY

Yeah, `cos that's working great for

you. You're completely fine.

75.

BRANDON

Well, I've got my own fucking

apartment.

SISSY

Oh, whopee-fucking-shit. You have

your own apartment, that's amazing.

Your job and an apartment, I should

be in awe of you.

BRANDON

Well, at least I'm responsible for

it. At least I don't depend on

people all the time. You know,

you're a dependency, you're a

parasite.

SISSY

You don't have anybody. You don't

have anybody. You have me and your

fucking pervert boss.

BRANDON

You slept with that fucking pervert

boss. So what does that make you?

SISSY

DOn't talk to me about sex-life

Brandon. Not from you.

BRANDON

Whatever.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I'm going out.

SISSY

Great. And then you'll just come

back and we'll just have this same

fucking conversation again.

BRANDON

No, you'll move out.

SISSY

And then I'll never hear from you

again?

CARLY

Hey-

BRANDON

Hey.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

(close to)

You want to get out of here?

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I could take you somewhere.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

What? Are you with someone? Does he

go down on you? I do..That's what I

like to do..

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I like the way it feels. I like the

way it's just me and it... I wanna

taste you. I like to slip my tongue

inside you-

BRANDON (CONT'D)

...just as you come.

77.

CARLY hesitates, the moment hangs dangerous between them.

BRANDON sucks his fingers.

BRANDON (CONT'D)

Want me to make you come?

BRANDON (CONT'D)

I can do that. Want me to do that?

BRANDON strokes her chin-

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

Hey-?

From behind, CARLY's MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND approaches, quizzical-

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND (CONT'D)

What's up babe?

CARLY nods, deflects-

CARLY

I was just getting some drinks.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

Yeah, huh?

BRANDON

I was just telling your pretty

girlfriend here, that I'd like to

fuck her in that tight pussy of

hers.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

(CHUCKLES)

BRANDON

I mean bone her real hard til she's

clawing up my back.

CARLY

He's kidding.

CARLY gently bars her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND, trying to diffuse

lead him away.

BRANDON

After I fuck her hard up the ass, I

put my balls in her mouth while I

come on her face.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

(To CARLY) You won't let me fuck

you in the ass.

CARLY

Christ.

78.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

You get to fuck her in the ass?

BRANDON

You know.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

Tell me more man, because you.. I'm

fucking loving this.

BRANDON

Smell it.

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND

100   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                          100

The grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground-

BRANDON stands on a platform. It's not the rush hour yet.

The RATTLE of the subway pulling in-

BRANDON boards the train.

101   INT. TRAIN. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                   101

A virtually empty car-

BRANDON sits-

A COLUMBIAN WOMAN across the car, head lent against the

window, half asleep, clearly at the end of a long shift.

Above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising LIFE

INSURANCE-

BRANDON's eyes graze over the poster-

He stands his reflection mirrored back at him, preparing for

his stop-

The train SCREECHES to a sudden halt-

Wheels SCREECHING along the track-

The COLUMBIAN WOMAN wakes-

A YOUNG STUDENT plugged headphone on, looks up from reading

her book.

BRANDON inwardly curses.

The train sits in the station. Doors not opening.

The silence at last punctured by the SHRILL hum of the

intercom-

INTERCOM

Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time,

due to a police investigation, we

have to discharge this train.

Please follow the conductor to the

rear of the train.

The long low PING of the intercom fading out-

They wait. And wait in silence.

BRANDON leans his head against the glass, closes his eyes, a

hangover kicking in.

83.

The other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly,

wondering why the doors aren't opening in the station.

Details of the carriage appear.

Half-drunken cup of coffee.

An old New York POST.

Graffiti on all the car windows.

They wait.

Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way

through the carriage that BRANDON's in, with the CONDUCTOR

ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end.

CONDUCTOR (O.S.)

Watch your step between cars.

Passengers asking, "What's going on?"

BRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers

to the last carriage. As he steps out, he looks down to his

far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled, and

ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of

the train.

102   INT. SUBWAY. DAWN.                                          102

A LARGE BLACK WOMAN, face bowed, sits talking to a POLICE

OFFICER giving a statement-

CONDUCTOR

Watch your step.

Several ENGINEERS stand further down the platform surrounding

a TRAUMATISED DRIVER-

CONDUCTOR

Follow, me please. Follow me.

Two PLATFORM ATTENDANTS talk to POLICE OFFICERS.

CONDUCTOR (CONT'D)

Watch your step. This way. This

way. Quickly

FEMALE CONDUCTOR

This way. Nothing to see. Move on.

CONDUCTOR (O.S.) (OVER)

Right this way, please.

FEMALE CONDUCTOR

Move on. This way.

84.

BRANDON makes his way past the wrought-iron gate with other

passengers, going up the stairwell.

103   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE SUBWAY. DAWN.                          103

BRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes

catching on-

A WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room,

discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace.

The intermittent WHIR of sirens-

BRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his

cellphone-

Beyond the glow of an ambulance-

BRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly

distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his

ear.

The PULSE of a distant phone ringing-

The answer machine kicks in-

ANSWER MACHINE

This is Sissy..leave a message..

Don't if you're an asshole.

BRANDON flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket. BRANDON

picks up his pace.

He flicks out his phone again. Tries again-

ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D)

This is Sissy..leave a me-

BRANDON is running now, heart beating fast now, breath

quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash-

BRANDON

Shit!

SUDDENLY he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk

at pace.

104   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - LOBBY. DAWN.                      104

His finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by

doing so will make it arrive quicker.

85.

105   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR. DAWN.                   105

BRANDON enters into the elevator. The door shuts immediately

behind him.

106   INT. BRANDON'S BUILDING - CORRIDOR. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. DAWN.

106

Exiting, BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor, reaching

his front door.

He is already pulling out his keys and pushing them into the

door with growing dread-

107   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. DAWN.                             107

The sound of running water from the bathroom. BRANDON stops

with relief, leaning his forehead against the bathroom door,

letting himself exhale-

BRANDON

Sissy-

SILENCE-

BRANDON hesitates, a seeping concern pricking his skin-

108   INT. BATHROOM. APARTMENT. DAWN.                             108

BRANDON walks into the bathroom, freezing on seeing-

SISSY sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the

toilet-

The pump of blood seeping from her wrists, already pooled

across the floor-

BRANDON reaches for SISSY gripping her wrists, deep slashes

scissoring the veins, the flap of skin, flaying-

BRANDON pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash, blood

seeping between his fingers-

BRANDON looks at her wrist, every time he moves his fingers,

he releases the pressure the blood flows.

BRANDON grips them tighter, a quiet determination to stop the

bleeding-

The skid of blood underfoot, BRANDON cradles her in his arms,

grappling with his phone, desperately calling 911.

BRANDON desperately holds her, cradled between his legs, his

fingers pressing her wrists, temporarily stemming the flow of

blood, the phone wedged between shoulder and chin.

86.

The slip of SISSY's wrist through BRANDON's fingers. He slams

down the phone, struggling to hold her in his grasp. She

slips again.

109   INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.                                         109

BRANDON head bowed. Sitting by Sissy's bedside-

SISSY lies, sleeping, skin white, strapped to a drip. The

gentle rise and fall of her breath.

BRANDON's gaze falling on SISSY lying in the hospital bed,

her wrists bandaged.

BRANDON, eyes falling on the scars covering her arms. He

reaches out a hand, on the edge of touching them, letting his

fingers hover over them until finally-

A FINGER lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm.

She stirs a little but-

SISSY's eyes just opening, focusing on him until-

SISSY

(murmuring)

Shithead.

Relief overwhelming BRANDON, he laughs, exhales on the edge.

BRANDON turns to stroke SISSY's hair, rests his head next to

hers. She sleeps again.

110   EXT. WATERFRONT. HUDSON RIVER. DUSK.                        110

BRANDON now walking along the side of the river, railings

seemingly speeding up his journey.

Beyond, the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch

out toward the open river.

111   EXT. DOCK. HUDSON RIVER. DUSK.                              111

The endless grey of the Hudson River, close now-

BRANDON walking along a concrete jetty-

A rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging

along the jetty until-

BRANDON reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out-

The LAP of grey water beneath.

87.

BRANDON stands, a hangover kicking in-

And at once BRANDON is crying, the tears flowing slow at

first until they rush, like floodgates opening. He reaches

for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his

body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion-

BRANDON sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body

shuddering.

The LAP of the water steady now-

BRANDON sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as

he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River.

Far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of

traffic kicking in-

The froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking,

back and forth.

112   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. MORNING.                            112

BRANDON stands in his familiar spot on the platform, waiting

for the train that will take him to work. Wearing a vacant

face, the train pulls into the station. BRANDON boards.

He takes a seat automatically, as if pre-programmed. The

train leaves the platform.

113   INT. TRAIN. SUBWAY. MORNING.                               113

Looking into no man's land, BRANDON feels the heat of

someone's gaze. As he instinctively looks up to respond, a

mixture of surprise, fear, excitement and doubt across his

face.

The PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL who we met at the beginning of our

story is staring down at BRANDON, this time in a more

engaging fashion. She looks because she wants to be looked

at.

Again, a dance begins. This time, she leads. Engaged, active,

decisive.

BRANDON's face is fractured into many conflicting emotions.

It's as if a magnet is drawing him in, but at the same time

he's trying to resist.

At this moment, the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL stands up, eyeing

BRANDON as she makes her way to the door, blocking BRANDON as

the train pulls in to her stop.

88.

114   INT. PLATFORM. SUBWAY. MORNING.                          114

The train pulls away from the station and disappears into the

tunnel. We do not know if BRANDON is still aboard or has

succumbed to his urges.

115   THE END                                                  115
