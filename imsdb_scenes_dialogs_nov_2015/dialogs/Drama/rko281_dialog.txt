Come into the light.. Come into the light

WOMAN

BOY

Mother...

WOMAN

You are made for the light, Orson Now you must blow

out your candles. But you must always remember, the

cake itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that

is where your future lies. You must have a dream. A

great dream worthy of you.

NEWSREEL VOICE

He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing

star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And

he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He

was 24 years old and his name was George Orson

Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners,

Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!

NEWSREEL VOICE

He made his debut on the world stage in Kenosha,

Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th

of May he spoke his first words, and unlike other

children who say commonplace things like "momma" and

"poppa", he proclaimed "I am a genius!"

NEWSREEL VOICE

So how could the magic of the stage not call to

this adventurous lad? Unstoppable and resolute, the

Boy Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit

theater. After a peripatetic beginning he found

himself at last in New York where he joined forces

with theatrical producer John Houseman under the

august auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.

HOUSEMAN

Orson barreled in and took over. Orson's a real

barreler.

NEWSREEL VOICE

Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy Genius invaded

the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of

New York theatre with production after production.

From MACBETH with an entirely colored cast to a

Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!

NEWSREEL VOICE

Though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars

the ticket sales left something to be desired. So,

after founding the Mercury Players with Houseman,

young Mr. Welles quickly set his sights on the

airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -' voice of

"The Shadow." ''

WELLES

Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The

Shadow knows. . .

NEWSREEL VOICE

With Lament Cranston in one pocket and his own

radio show. The Mercury Theater of the Air, our Boy

Wonder filled the night with his resounding tones.

And on October 30th of 1938, he became what he felt

destined to be: a household name.

NEWSREEL VOICE

THE WAR OF THE WORLDS sent this nation spinning

into a frenzy. Nine million listeners clasped their

loved ones close and looked to the skies with

horror. Unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the

"invasion" -- rural New Jersey -- ran screaming into

the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death

awaited them around every corner! The mischievous

Boy Wonder had fooled us all!

WELLES

(contritely)

Of course ... of course ... if I had known the

panic the broadcast was causing -- well I would have

stopped! I never meant for any of this to happen and

I feel just horrible!

NEWSREEL VOICE

How long, oh how long could it possibly be before

the sunny land of dreams tried to harness the

combustible power of this showman, this impresario,

this best of all possible Boy Wonders?!

SCHAEFER

NEWSREEL VOICE

The winner in the Welles derby was George Schaefer,

the head of RKO Pictures. With a contract

unimaginable before The Days Of Orson, Mr. Schaefer

captured the whirlwind snared the beast, roped the

tyrant!

NEWSREEL VOICE

Eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over

Hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured

The Great Orson came forth: the Boy Wonder could

produce, write, direct and star in his own projects

with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! He would have

total control over the shooting of the picture and

the finished product. The studio, well, they just

paid the bills. Meanwhile, the insiders of filmland

were skeptical.

HOLLYWOOD INSIDER

John Ford doesn't have a deal like that. Cecil B.

DeMille doesn't have a deal like that. No one has a

deal like that! If ya ask me, George Schaefer is

just plain nuts

NEWSREEL VOICE

So Cometh Orson! He toured the RKO studio and met

with the biggest of the big! He charmed his way

through the town from the Brown Derby to the

Copacabana, from the Pacific Palisades to the

Hollywood Hills!

NEWSREEL VOICE

Yes, the Boy Wonder had arrived! He even charmed

those rival maidens of Hollywood gossip, those well-

coiffured chroniclers of the dream factory: Hedda

Hopper and Louella Parsons.

LOUELLA

Orson is the sweetest boy. We're both from the

midwest, you know. He's just a local fella making

good, ya follow?

NEWSREEL VOICE

So today, almost a year after his arrival in

Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at

work developing his much-anticipated first feature,

preparing to dazzle us all again. We're waiting,

Orson!

WELLES

I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train

set a boy ever had!

MAYER

Who does that cocksucker think he is?

FLUNKIE

They're laying bets over on the RKO

lot that this great deal will end up

with him never doing a picture. Back

to New York he goes.

MAYER

Serves him right. I mean can you stomach the

arrogance?

FLUNKIE

Inside skinny says the glory boy's finished,

can't come up with a movie. Wants to do a biography now.

MAYER

After RKO boots him maybe we'll pick him up cheap.

Have him do that WAR OF THE WORLDS crap as a

feature.

MANK

I don't know what you expected with Joseph-

fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is

Hollywood, pal.

WELLES

All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer

and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--

MANK

But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap -

- HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! -

- no one wants to see that.

WELLES

Nonsense

MANK

What are movies about, Orson?

WELLES

Forget it-

MANK

What are movies about?

WELLES

Telling stories.

MANK

Nope.

WELLES

Showing life

MANK

Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to

death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy.

They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.

WELLES

(happily)

Magic

MANK

Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You

got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same

job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You

gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all

about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.

WELLES

Not for me.

MANK

Then you better get ready to be the youngest never-

was in Hollywood history.

WELLES

That's better than being the oldest has-been in

Hollywood history.

MANK

You're a laugh-riot, kid.

WELLES

Here, turn around.

WELLES

So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our

biography.

MANK

Right-

WELLES

We find the man and then we dissect him-

MANK

Like a bug.

WELLES

But with compassion and insight--

MANK

(glancing at his watch)

Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to

lateness.

WELLES

(into the mirror)

How do you do, Mr. Hearst? My name is Orson

Welles.

WELLES

How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes

MANK

I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would

kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow

WELLES

Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?

MANK

Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah

at the

her.

MARION

And we would hear them scuttling around at night

with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t-

teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all

over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere.

And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung

but no mice!

CAROLE LOMBARD

Houdini mice.

MARION

Just wait. So one night I notice Pops getting outta

bed and sneaking away. And he's got this little p-p-

paper bag with him, right? Middle of the night. So I

figure the old man's really up to no good this time

and I follow him. Well I'll be g-g-goddamned if he's

not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for

the rats!

MARION

You and that freak Disney, in love with the damn

rats!

HEARST

They really are sweet little things

WELLES

Sigmund Freud?

MANK

Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad

and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you

wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so

goddamn smart.

WELLES

(suddenly inspired)

Manolete?!

MANK

Who the hell's Manolete?

WELLES

The great Spanish bullfighter

MANK

I don't wanna write about no spic.

WELLES

No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape!

False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have

been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the

days of lrving and Booth. (He flourishes his napkin

like a bullfighter's cape.) Imagine me in a

glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian

plains--

MARION

Why Mr. Welles is attempting semaphore

WELLES

Bullfighting, Miss Davies!

MARION

And is dear Mank your b-b-bull?

WELLES

My factotum, ally and comrade-in-arms

MANK

Writer, flunkie, pimp--

CAROLE LOMBARD

(wry)

You fight many bulls there in New York, Orson?

WELLES

Ever met Walter Winchell?

WELLES

(expansively, warming into a story)

No, when I was but a tender lad--

CAROLE LOMBARD

Last week would this be?

WELLES

My father and I made a tour of the grand boulevards

of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had

the chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the

great Manolete I took up the cape and sword -

(he uses his napkin and knife to

demonstrate)

-- across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to

have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So -

- with Manolete shouting encouragement I flourished

. . . I flourished again . . . and the bull charged!

Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the

great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its

calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking

the earth as I held the crimson eye of the bull with

my own, defying it -- it was almost upon me and I

flourished one last time! -- the monster swept past!

-

(he spins his napkin in the air and his

knife is now gone, a magic trick)

-- and my sword was gone -- buried in the bloody

eye of the beast!

HEARST

(quietly)

You are evidently a man who knows a great deal

about bull.

HEARST

Of all man's malignity -- of all his sadism -- none

is more depraved than cruelty to animals.

WELLES

In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast

a fighting end.

HEARST

Who are you, sir?

WELLES

My name is Orson Welles

HEARST

The actor

WELLES

And director.

HEARST

I see. And you are in California for what reason?

WELLES

To make pictures.

HEARST

And what pictures have you made?

WELLES

None.

HEARST

Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous

business.

WELLES

So I've been told.

HEARST

In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most

brutally killed.

WELLES

I'll remember that.

MARION

Enough Hollywood talk! Can't anyone talk about

anything else?

MANX

Heard some juicy gossip from Metro.

MARION

(eagerly)

Ooh, dish.

WELLES

(quietly)

The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is

monstrous.

MANK

The old man has his own way of doing things

WELLES

He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality

every day in his sordid little papers for everyone

else in the world but he lives openly with his

mistress.

MANK

Buddy, when you own the largest publishing empire

in the universe you can do whatever the hell you

want. Think about it, pal. Every day one out of five

Americans picks up a Hearst publication. 30

newspapers, a dozen magazines, a bunch of radio

stations and the grand dragon of them all. Little

Miss Louella Parsons. Tends to give you some of that

ol' noblesse oblige.

WELLES

Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an

artist. A modern Caravaggio.

MANK

No, baby, those are the hands of a killer

HEARST

There you are, honey. Aren't you a wonderful girl?

MARION

God, these parties are the worst

CAROLE LOMBARD

You need to get outta here, Rapunzel

MARION

That's why he has the parties, he says it's like

bringing the world to me.

CAROLE LOMBARD

Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a

while.

MARION

With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No

thanks.

MARION

(somewhat ruefully)

It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't

want to live in a castle?

MARION

Mr. Welles certainly is a caution

CAROLE LOMBARD

(smiles)

Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down,

he's a good kid. Real deep down.

MARION

And attractive in a hammy sort of way.

CAROLE LOMBARD

Mm.

CAROLE LOMBARD

Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few

days. Just tell the old man that--

MARION

I can't

CAROLE LOMBARD

Sure you can, just--

MARION

He needs me here.

WELLES

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome

decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?

MANK

The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.

WELLES

Jesus

MANK

Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd

had the money.

MARION

Mankie, Mankie d-d-dance with me

MANK

You've been naughty, haven't you, honey?

MARION

Shit, can you smell it? You got any sen-sen?

MANK

Sorry.

MARION

Mr. Welles, you got any--? Oh fuck it.

CAROLE LOMBARD

Meanwhile, Orson, I thought your bullfighting story

was nifty. Let's cut a rug.

CAROLE LOMBARD

So you ever gonna do a picture?

WELLES

Not you too

CAROLE LOMBARD

(smiles)

It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.

WELLES

I wonder sometimes.

CAROLE LOMBARD

You're just scared.

WELLES

Am I?

CAROLS LOMBARD

Sure

WELLES

And what am I scared of?

CAROLE LOMBARD

Of being found out. Of not being a genius

WELLES

(smiles)

Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder.

I've been a genius since the moment I was born.

CAROLE LOMBARD

We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the

bullshit elsewhere.

WELLES

Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify

you with evasions of--

CAROLE LOMBARD

Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it

for Louella.

CAROLE LOMBARD

You make your mark, Orson.

MARION

Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!

HEARST

There's no call for that language-

MARION

There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to

hell with you!

WELLES

That poor woman.

CAROLE LOMBARD

(sadly)

She knew what she was signing on for After all,

she took the money.

WELLES

Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!

MANK

(pained)

Orson, please ... it's too bright

WELLES

Here you are, up with the birds for once, you

vampire!

MANK

(settling into a deck chair)

Okay, boy wonder, what?

WELLES

Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief

in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!

MANK

Oh for Christ's sake-

WELLES

I know who we're going to get I The great American

biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.

MANK

This better be good

WELLES

Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic

figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A

man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron,

living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and

controlling the permutations of everyone beneath

him. Feudal.

MANK

(realizing)

Oh Christ...

WELLES

Image the possibilities as this man controls the

public perception of the nation through his--

MANK

Oh Christ

WELLES

Yes.

MANK

(quietly)

Please don't say this.

WELLES

Mank-

MANK

Don't whisper it. Don't even think it

WELLES

How long have we spent casting our minds about the

world when the answer to our prayers was right here

under our noses -- every single day in the

newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in

that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!

MANK

Orson. Stop. Just stop

WELLES

Now remember he's a public figure who sought out

that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--

MANK

(laughs coldly) Listen to you. You

child! Men like him don't bother with

things like legality. They don't have to.

You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power

like you couldn't even begin to imagine.

MANK

Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he

would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.

WELLES

We're doing Hearst.

MANK

You may think you know what you're talking about,

kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about

going into a battle you can never win on a

battlefield so far above things like movies and

Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down

when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with

one finger. I'm talking about money and influence

and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.

WELLES

So speaks the court jester.

MANK

Fuck you

WELLES

I expected more from you.

MANK

Sorry to disappoint.

WELLES

(with building venom)

How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and

making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell

your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table?

How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they

keep to amuse themselves--?!

MANK

It feels just fine, you pompous fuck-

WELLES

I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant

writer who dazzled me time and time again with his

wit and insight--

MANK

Don't do this

WELLES

Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in

four years--

MANK

Don't do this

WELLES

(savagely)

--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting

himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a

sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every

studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because

he's a drunk- -!

MANK

AND YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A GODDAMN PHONY! What is all

this "Orson Welles" bullshit?! This boy genius

crap?! What the fuck did you ever CREATE? You're

just another goddamn ACTOR!

MANK

Let me out.

WELLES

Listen to me-

MANK

Fuck you--

WELLES

MANK

(suddenly)

I don't have it anymore?!

MANK

When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too -

- I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures

and telling great stories. But all that's finished

for me--

WELLES

It doesn't have to be

MANK

And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been

keeping notes on him for years for my ...

(he laughs bitterly)

great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No

studio's gonna hire me and I - -

WELLES

I'll hire you  -- right now-

MANK

I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink

all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore.

All that is over for me--

WELLES

(roars)

NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS

WELLES

(deeply)

Look, Mank, this is our only chance

MANK

He'll destroy us.

WELLES

Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?

WELLES

Take my hand, Mank. And we'll dance one last time.

We'll dance to the music of the angels. We'll make

history. We'll scorch the earth. We will ...

astonish them all.

MANK

Thank God you don't write dialogue

WELLES

So, who is he? We have to know him.

MANK

Everyone sees someone different. That's what we

show.

WELLES

How?

MANK

Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different

facet is illuminated.

MANK

Go

WELLES

The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this

man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're

dying. What's the last image that comes to you?

Right now.

MANK

This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word

to her.

WELLES

Why her?

MANK

She was . . . innocent

MANK

So when was our man innocent? Was there a moment

early on -- of innocence and bliss? There must have

been. Okay, you're dying - what do you think?

MANK

(probing)

Something you lost maybe?

MANK

Something you can never get back?

MANK'S VOICE

Men like Hearst don't love..

WELLES

All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't

bother with convention because--

MANK

They don't have to.

WELLES

He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because

those are the only conditions he has ever known.

WELLES

(quietly)

Hearst looks down at the world at his feet

Everything has always been beneath him.

MANK

And what does he see?

WELLES

The people. When they pay him homage, he adores

them. But when they have the ... audacity to

question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then

he despises them.

MANK

And when he looks up? What does he dream about?

MANK

I'm ready to write it, Orson

WELLES

MANK

MANK

Leiand: "You talk about the people as if you owned

them. As though they belonged to you. But you don't

really care about anything except you."  Craig: "A

toast then, Jedediah, to all those people who didn't

vote for me today and to love on my own terms. Those

are the only terms anybody ever knows. . . "

MANK'S VOICE (CONT.)

"...because in the end a man looks into the mirror

and sees one face looking back not humanity -- not

"the people" -- one face. And he's got to be able to

look at that one face and know he was true. "

JOHN HOUSEMAN

That's too long. Tighten it up

MANK

You're killin' me here, Housey. Okay, make that,

Craig: "A toast, Jedediah, to love on my own terms.

Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his

own."

JOHN HOUSEMAN

Telegram from The Christ Child

JOHN HOUSEMAN

"Schaefer loves the idea. Stop. Start writing.

Stop. Stop drinking. Stop. Did you work in the

jigsaw puzzles. Question mark. Don't stop. Stop.

Love you madly, Orson."

MANK

That man makes my brain hurt

WELLES' VOICE

And Gregg Toland plunks down his Oscar for

WUTHERING HEIGHTS and says, "Mr. Welles, I want to

shoot your picture. . . "

WELLES (CONT.)

... And I said, "Mr. Toland, you are the finest

cinematographer in Hollywood, why would you desire

to work with a stumbling neophyte?"

WELLES

And he replied, "Mr. Welles, the only way to learn

anything new is to work with someone who doesn't

know a damn thing."

LOUELLA

(scribbling on a pad)

Priceless!

WELLES

Hedda, this movie is going to look like no other

picture ever made.

WELLES

Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't

you get tired of the errant falsity in motion

pictures?

LOUELLA

Huh?

WELLES

What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all

it's joyous complexity.

WELLES

Consider this quarter, my dear. You can touch it

and feel it and were you to lean forward you could

even smell it. Why is it that in the movies a simple

bit of reality -- a quarter, a room, a man--

WELLES

Becomes nothing but a lie? A trick. An illusion.

WELLES

I will show the reality behind the trick.

WELLES

I will use the illusions of Hollywood to show . . .

the truth.

HEDDA

What does truth have to do with movies?

LOUELLA

(confused)

So, what, it went into your other hand?

WELLES

And so the dreamer awakens into the realms of

reality. He has been given a rendition of the truth.

He has been treated with respect.

HEDDA

Orson, that's all terribly interesting but what's

all this about you and Dolores Del Rio? Do I hear

love birds a'singin'?

LOUELLA

Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your

picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're

writing about a publisher, right?

WELLES

We're using-

LOUELLA

You're not doin' Hearst, are you?

WELLES

Good God no! The character is a delicious

amalgamation of various press barons--

LOUELLA

A delicious amalgamation, is it?

WELLES

That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and

valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen

standing sentry on our liberties--

LOUELLA

Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are

not doing Hearst.

WELLES

I am not doing Hearst.

WELLES

It's 350 pages long.

MANK

Yeah, but the margins are real wide.

WELLES

It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!

WELLES

Housey, get us a drink.

WELLES

I told you you could do this! How could you have

ever doubted me!? You must never doubt me again!

MANK

It's good, huh?

WELLES

Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's

terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of

course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . .

exactly . . .

MANK

What?

WELLES

Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think

we need to change the name.

MANK

The title?

WELLES

No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from

God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that!

I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster

Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I

was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?

MANK

Cain -- like the Bible guy?

WELLES

K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I

MANK

(weakly)Craig is one syllable

WELLES

But it's not a great syllable

MANK

I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been

drinking since I started on this--

WELLES

( toasting)

To my invaluable comrade Drink up!

MANK

I'm out, aren't I?

HOUSEMAN

Welcome to the world of Orson Welles.

MANK

YOU FUCK! YOU SELFISH FUCK!

WELLES

Jesus Christ --

MANK

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY,

REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE -

- REMEMBER THAT?!

MANK

Pal from the studio sent this -- you see that?!

What does it say?! WHAT DOES IT SAY ORSON?!

WELLES

Get away from me--

MANX

It says AMERICAN by Orson Welles. YOU TOOK MY NAME

OFF THE FUCKING SCRIPT!

WELLES

It's obviously a mistake, Manki Some steno girl

made a mistake, alright?!

MANK

You can't do this to me--!

WELLES

(savagely)

I fucking well can! I own your script and I can do

anything I goddamn want. And don't forget for one

minute that I took your 350 pages of drunken

rambling and I made a movie out of them -- and now

I've got to shoot the bastard. So thank you very

much, I have all I need. And you can stop calling

me.

MANK

(quietly)

I hope you choke on it. I hope it kills you.

MARION

This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some

kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a

temple to you? I can't see it myself--

HEARST

(quietly)

Darling, I talked to Millicent.

HEARST

She said no

MARION

There. That's right.

HEARST

She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in

peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.

MARION

(not looking up)

Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks

I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...

(she clenches her fists)

will.

HEARST

I'm so sorry.

WELLES

It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think

of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF

UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it

-- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that

strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid,

Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--

SCHAEFER

CITIZEN KANE

WELLES

Pardon?

SCHAEFER

CITIZEN KANE There's your title.

WELLES

A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the

eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF

ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--

SCHAEFER

Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

The budget projections on this--

WELLES

(theatrically)

I know, I know! But what more can you expect of

me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to

save money but to cut more would be to--!

SCHAEFER

Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've

stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems

like, while the stockholders in New York were ready

to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was

set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract

stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's

gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about

that?

SCHAEFER

Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think

again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-

WELLES

Jesus

SCHAEFER

Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's

happy. You make some money and New York's happy and

you have a track record and then we'll move on to

KANE.

WELLES

Please don't ask me to do this.

SCHAEFER

It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong

with that.

WELLES

(simply)

George, I want you to let me make this movie

because I need to make it. And I don't really know

why. Afterwards there' II be all the time in the

world to make money and sell popcorn. And I'll do

that for you. For RKO and New York. But for now ...

please let me tell this story.

WELLES

It's your decision, George. If you look into my

eyes right now and say, go make WAR OF THE WORLDS, I

will. I'll make it. And, yes, it'll make you money.

SCHAEFER

If it'll get you the hell out of my office, go

ahead and make the picture.

SCHAEFER

Say thank you, Orson.

SCHAEFER

For the title

WELLES

(smiles)

Ah, it's a grand title.

SCHAEFER

Like it would kill him to say thank you

ABSOLUTELY NO

WELLES

Today we - -

WELLES

Today we are going to break every rule in motion

picture history...

WELLES' VOICE

Together we will throw away all the maps and we

will become -joyously lost in the wilderness. And

the future cartographers of Hollywood will forever

chart our course. Following our lead...

WELLES' VOICE

And do you know why we're going to do this?

WELLES

We're going to do this because it's going to be

fun.

ORSON

It needs a ceiling, Gregg. Real rooms have real

ceilings.

GREGG TOLAND

You want a ceiling on this one too?

WELLES

You bet.

GREGG TOLAND

Gonna be tough

WELLES

(smiles)

No, it's gonna be impossible. That's why we're

doing it.

PAUL STEWART

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."

WELLES

Again

PAUL STEWART

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud

WELLES

Again

WELLES

Well, that didn't really work

WELLES

It is the most important line of the picture. You

will weave the magic of "Rosebud" in a single word -

- you will say the word in such a way as to impart

to us the mystery of it. It is a divine and sinister

mystery worthy only of your talent. In this one word

the movie soars or falls. Once more, I beg you.

Mr. Welles...?

WELLES

DOROTHY COMMINGORE

"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking

at things . "

WELLES

No -- no -- I'll pour the tea. Sorry. I should pour

the tea. Let's try that again.

WELLES

Okay, here we go... Set. Action

DOROTHY COMMINGORE

"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking

at things . "

WELLES

No -- that's not right

WELLES

Urn. . . ah . . . yes -- you should definitely pour

the tea. Okay, again. Sorry.... Set. Action.

DOROTHY COMMINGORE

"Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking

at things . "

TOLAND

Orson, you wanna take five?

WELLES

Five...? Yes. No. We're done today

PHONE VOICE

I don't know if this means anything but I just

talked to a guy in the RKO art department They've

got all these books and crap all over the place.

Pictures of San Simeon.

PHONE VOICE

For the Welles picture.

LOUELLA

Pictures of the castle?

PHONE VOICE

Yeah

LOUELLA

Thanks, doll. Get me more.

WELLES

And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking

at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '

MANK

Uh huh.

WELLES

I just can't . . see it anymore

WELLES

I want you back

MANK

Fuck you. (He sits.) You wanted me out. I'm out.

WELLES

I'm sorry.

MANK

I don't care.

WELLES

This is the shooting script we've been using every

day.

WELLES

It's just like we always said it would be

MANK

Too late, kid.

WELLES

Did I ever tell you about my father?

MANK

I don't give a shit about-

WELLES

He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was

ashamed of him.

WELLES

He showed me the world, he took me with him

everywhere -- Europe, China -- and he was so proud

of me. But he would drink and he would get

...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I

was so ... sparkling, you see.

WELLES

When I finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. I

was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn't that

embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who

showed me the world.

WELLES

Just like you, Mank.

MANK'S VOICE

So you've lost it? Don't know who should pour the

tea.

WELLES

Yeah

MANK'S VOICE

Orson ... just cut the goddamn tea

WELLES

Okay

MANK'S VOICE

I been thinking about the beach scene. You done

that yet?

WELLES

MANK'S VOICE

Good -- cause I was thinking that we're starting

the scene too late...

MANK'S VOICE (CONT.)

Cause if we don't show Susan watching Kane more

then we're not building the right tension into the

scene. See, she's gotta know that...

TOLAND'S VOICE

Closer ... closer ... closer -- stop. We just lost

your head.

WELLES

Can you see my shoes?

TOLAND'S VOICE

Yeah, but we lose your head.

WELLES

Goddamn it Joe -- stand here

WELLES

It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We

have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring

to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--

TOLAND

Spare me the aria, I know what you want--

WELLES

I need my shoes in total focus right here and also

Joe back there--!

TOLAND

I know what you want but it can't be done!

WELLES

Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a

few more inches down and then tilt up--

TOLAND

Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any

fucking lower so find another fucking shot!

WELLES

Come on, Gregg! We'll tear out this floor!

TOLAND

It's midnight, why don't we pick it up tomorrow?

WELLES

Get me a jackhammer.

MANK

(wryly, to Cotton)

There but for the grace of God, goes God.

WELLES' VOICE

Okay, Joe . . . come closer . . . closer

WELLES

"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss

Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've

set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All

right, if that's the way they want it, the people

have made their choice. It's obvious the people

prefer Jim Gettys to me."

JOSEPH COTTON

"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As

though they belonged to you. As long as I can

remember, you've talked about--" (he breaks

character)

Orson, I am so goddamn tired--

WELLES

(to the camera operator)

Keep filming.

JOSEPH COTTON

I can't remember the lines!

WELLES

Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.

WELLES

This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy.

Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!

JOSEPH COTTON

We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some

of us humans need sleep!

WELLES

You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look

right at the monster and you tell him--

JOSEPH COTTON

(deeply)

"You don't care about anything except you. You just

want to persuade people that you

JOSEPH COTTON (CONT.)

love them so much that they ought to love you back.

Only you want love on your own terms. "

WELLES

"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms.

Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his

own."

WELLES

Cut. Print

WELLES

How 'bout a real drink?

TOLAND

We done?

WELLES

Yeah.

WELLES

(quietly)

It's finished.

WELLES

Good morning, good morning. . .

HEDDA

(on phone)

Orson, Hedda here! You naughty boy! You told me

that I would be positively the first human soul to

see your masterpiece and here I read in the Reporter

that there's a screening tonight for the magazines

... yes, advance deadlines, I understand . . . (she

smiles) . . . oh, rough cut, uh-huh ... Been there,

Orson, know the drill. See ya tonight!

HEDDA

Get offa me, ya little prick

WELLES

This is an abomination There's no music and--

SCHAEFER

They've all seen a rough cut

WELLES

The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did

we have to let her come?!

SCHAEFER

When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of

martinis and you pray.

WELLES

What the hell did that mean?!

HEDDA

(brightly)

Why hello, Mr. Hearst! I'm so delighted you could

take my call. I just wanted to let you know -- I saw

this Orson Welles picture last night. First

screening ever, don't cha know, and, Mr. Hearst, I

don't understand something . . . (she smiles

wickedly) ... I just don't understand why Louella

hasn't told you it ' s all about you. . . Yes, oh

yes . . . My pleasure, sir.

HEDDA

Take that, you old cow

SECRETARY'S VOICE Mr. Schaefer, Miss Parsons is here

SCHAEFER

(into intercom)

Here? As in right outside the door?

SECRETARY'S VOICE

Yes, sir

SCHAEFER

(chipper, into intercom)

Well, send her in!

SCHAEFER

Shit

LOUELLA

Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture

SCHAEFER

Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would

you like--?

LOUELLA

(eyeing gossip)

You drink at 10 am, do you?

SCHAEFER

No -- no -- I mean--

LOUELLA

I wanna see the picture today

SCHAEFER

That might be a tad difficult because Orson is

scoring the picture now and he's very particular

about the music--

LOUELLA

Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me

to see the picture today.

SCHAEFER

He personally asked you to?

LOUELLA

That's right

SCHAEFER

Hearst?

LOUELLA

Uh-huh

LOUELLA

I'll be back at noon. Set it up in screening room

four.

SCHAEFER

Oh god

" KANE "

"You'll continue with your singing, Susan. I don't

propose to have myself made ridiculous. "

"SUSAN ALEXANDER"

"You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous

I What about me?! I'm the one that's got to do the

singing! I'm the one who gets the razzberries!"

LOUELLA'S VOICE

It is . . . assassination.

LOUELLA (CONT.)

It's all you. It has the political campaigns and

the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the

castle. And ... Marion.

HEARST

How so?

LOUELLA

The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man

spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's

opera and not movies. And...

HEARST

Yes?

LOUELLA

(quietly)

The drinking.

HEARST

(very controlled)

So my life is a subject for mockery. All of it.

Every detail. Every personal detail.

HEARST

Thank you for your time

LOUELLA

Thank you, sir. She begins to leave

HEARST

Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for

you.

LOUELLA

Sir?

(stops)

HEARST

Why did we not know about this sooner?

LOUELLA

Sir?

HEARST

I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and

ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide

this simple service you are of no use to me.

LOUELLA

Sir, I-

HEARST

(lethally)

Please be quiet.

LOUELLA

He lied to me

LOUELLA

He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about

you.

HEARST

And how do you feel when you are lied to?

LOUELLA

I want blood

HEARST

Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from

this day forth. It shall nourish us both

WELLES

Give me one dinner with her and I'll sort it out.

Woman of a certain age are woefully susceptible to a

younger man's charm. I'll make myself so

monumentally attractive that

SCHAEFER

(sickened)

Oh Christ...

SCHAEFER

This is the morning edition of the EXAMINER.

SCHAEFER

And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?

WELLES

The ad..

SCHAEFER

They dumped our ad.

SCHAEFER

(quietly)

They dumped all our ads.

HEARST

Louis

MAYER

Randolph!

HEARST

Hope you don't mind my popping in--

MAYER

HEARST

(sitting)

What a wretched place this is. I can't come to town

without feeling filthy. You really must buy that

parcel of land by the castle and come north.

HEARST

Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you

heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?

MAYER

Over at RKO?

HEARST

Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.

MAYER

(confused)

Uh-hub.

HEARST

Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher

like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you

follow so far?

MAYER

Yeah

HEARST

I can't see how the release of that picture will do

anyone any good, really.

HEARST

Say, while I'm in town why don't we play 18 holes

at Bel Air? Or maybe just nine. Do you have time for

a round today?

HEARST

And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn

and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.

MAYER

(quietly)

You know that can't happen.

HEARST

Oh, why is that?

HEARST

Why is that, Louis?

MAYER

Bel Air is restricted.

HEARST

Oh, that's right. How silly of me to have

forgotten. I sometimes forget that you're all Jews.

Lots of people forget that. If they ever knew it.

HEARST

See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE

picture, won't you?

MAYER

(quietly)

Yeah

HEARST

And you'll come out to the castle soon, I hope

Marion and I would love to see more of you.

LOUELLA

That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an

RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never

see the light of day.

SCHAEFER

Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you

have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can

work something out--

LOUELLA

Nix, sweetie. You shelve it

SCHAEFER

Oh for God's sake, Louella-

LOUELLA

And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that

you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in

history if you release this picture. He'll bleed

your little studio dry and you can all go on back to

New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.

SCHAEFER

Can I talk to Hearst?

LOUELLA

You are talking to him.

HEARST

The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.

MARION

You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president,

after all.

HEARST

He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the

end of the year. I think I'm going to run that

wheelchair picture.

MARION

Don't

MARION

Whaddaya think?

WILLICOMBE

Sir, we got the call.

HEARST

Thank you, Joseph.

MARION

How bad is it?

HEARST

Nothing for you to worry about, darling

MARION

Pops

HEARST

The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on

the debts.

MARION

How much?

HEARST

It's not really--

MARION

How much?

HEARST

125 million.

MARION

(softly)

We're 125 million dollars in debt?

HEARST

Yes.

MARION

How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?

HEARST

One . . . buys things.

WELLES

We open on Monument Valley. Those towering

stalagmites reaching up like pleading fingers to

God. A single figure treads the arid plains. The

crimson sun is behind him so his shadow stretches

toward us. He is a simple man wearing a simple robe.

A profoundly quiet and sad man. Who is he?

BERNARD HERMANN

Orson, please..

WELLES

(whispering, to Toland)

Who is he, Gregg?

TOLAND

(realizing)

Oh, no--

WELLES

Yes!

TOLAND

He's Christ?

WELLES

I'm Christ

TOLAND

You want to do the life of Jesus?

WELLES

Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso

sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the

whole thing in the gallant American West--

MANK

Hey, kid. Gregg.

WELLES

Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new

picture but I'll go back--

MANK

No, you gotta hear this-

BERNARD HERMANN

(snapping back at them)

I'm trying to work here!

WELLES

Sorry, you keep at it, old boy.

MANK

You read Louella?

WELLES

No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny

upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she

wouldn't know how to spell that

MANK

(reads)

"And how is the country to feel when this industry

continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and

swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't

Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real

Americans deserve work?"

WELLES

(laughs)

Well, at least she's off KANE today

MANK

No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's

using code language to the studio bosses.

"Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who

the hell do you think she's talking about?

WELLES

(playfully)

Hedy Lamarr?

MANK

Jews. She's talking about Jews.

MANK

Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio?

The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew"

and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool

they start sweating.

WELLES

(growing tense)

So they're Jews. . .

MANK

This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or

later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys

know that there is only one thing this country hates

more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.

WELLES

Christ.

MANK

Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You

don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's

like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red-

white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it

you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam

Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick

becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna

think he's Irish for fuck's sake--

WELLES

What does this have to do with--?

MANK

(dead serious)

Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I

mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from

gettin' out.

WELLES

(sharply)

What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what

they're going to do?!

SOUND TECHNICIAN Sorry, Mr. Welles, I can't really hear

MANK

(quietly)

Let me tell you a story, son  So this was 1924,

right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for

Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all

on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from

Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was.

This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin,

Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices

Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing

everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs

his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix,

standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom -

- boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet

through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying

on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an

embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice

and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No

inquest and no police. It was right after this that

Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to

keep her all hush-hush.

MANK

If he had known about KANE before you made it,

you'd be dead already.

WELLES

(weakly)

It's too late. The movie's made

MANK

They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other

studio heads--

WELLES

You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to

fight for it?!

MANK

(bitterly)

I told you this was going to happen! I told you he

was going to come after us! So we took the chance

anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got

my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what

it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.

WELLES

I WILL NOT MOVE ON! Let them do their worst! These

petty tyrants! These monstrous, small men Do they

think they can stop us? I Who are they?! Who are

they?! THEY ARE . .. ACCOUNTANTS I

BERNARD HERMANN

We're ready. You want to hear it?

TOLAND

His next picture ... he wants to play Christ.

MANK

Hope he's planning to start with the crucifixion.

"RAYMOND"

"Throw that junk in, too.

HEARST

Switch it off SWITCH IT OFF

HEARST

(quietly)

Would everyone please leave

MARION

Well -- he got us, didn't he?

MARION

Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.

HEARST

Marion--

MARION

Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his

goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he

married her!

HEARST

This picture--

MARION

(deeply)

I am not that woman.

MARION

(pained)

I mean he's even got the goddamn jigsaw puzzles

MARION

Why did he do that to us?

HEARST

And now of all times -- NOW -- when I am grasping

on with my fingernails to live at all this Orson We

lies -- this insect -- this reprehensible insect --

has the nerve TO CHALLENGE ME! To show my life as

some cheap sideshow -- A FREAK SHOW -- A DYING,

IMPOTENT OLD FREAK IN HIS CASTLE!

HEARST

(intensely)

Mr. Willicombe -- you have seen me in adversity --

you have seen me take on the unions and the Congress

and the railroads -- and we have risen above -- we

have risen above. And if that dog Welles thinks he

can strike at me now -- when he thinks I'm weak when

he thinks I'm vulnerable -- then he does not fully

comprehend the man is facing.

WILLICOMBE Mr. Welles can't know anything about the

difficulties

HEARST

Get me Louella Parsons, now!

HEARST

This upstart -- this puny man -- how does he even

dare to imagine he could comprehend my life and my

world when he crawls with the other insects in the

sewer -- in the dung -- when we control every moment

of his life from the instant he is born to the

instant we decide that he will die! Does he have no

idea of the power that controls him?!

WILLICOMBE

Mr. Hearst, I have Miss Par'

HEARST

Miss Parsons, Mr. Hearst. Use the file

HEARST

Now get me J. Edgar Hoover

WILLICOMBE It's very late in Washington-

HEARST

Then wake him up!

HEARST

That insect thinks he knows me! He thinks he knows

my capabilities! When his neck is in my teeth and

his blood is in my throat then he will know WILLIAM

RANDOLPH HEARST!

LOUELLA

So what do we got here, L.B.? We got faggots and

commies and junkies. We got movie stars screwing

niggers and little girls. We got killers and

perverts and whores.

LOUELLA

We got MGM and Warner Brothers and Columbia and

Disney and Fox.

LOUELLA

We got Jews

LOUELLA

We got Hollywood.

MAYER

(quietly)

What do you want?

LOUELLA

Kill CITIZEN KANE.

MAYER

How?

LOUELLA

I don't give a shit.

LOUELLA

The boss is working on some stuff and I'm working

on some stuff. Now I want all you boys working on

some stuff. Cause if it looks like this picture's

ever gonna come out -- I start running down the

street with these pictures like a screaming woman

with my throat cut, you follow?

HOOVER

Agent McCabe, if you please.

HOOVER

Open a new file. Heading: Welles, Orson. Native

born. Communist.

MARION

How bad is it?

WILLICOMBE

Miss Davies--

MARION

Come on Joe. How bad is it?

WILLICOMBE

It's finished

HEARST

I've been thinking about the Tribune in Chicago.

The Examiner just can't make any headway.

Circulation is still down. I think we should buy the

Tribune.

MARION

Sure, Pops. That's a swell idea

MANK

... and Rita Hayworth says: "You see, he truly was

the Son of God" ... big Toland lighting effect ...

blah, blah, blah ...

AGENT McCABE

Mr. Mankiewicz, I'm Special Agent McCabe of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation. Might I have a

moment of your time?

MANK

Sure, kid, come in. I'm writing the crucifixion and

it's a bitch. Sit down

AGENT McCABE

I would like to ask you a few questions about Mr.

Welles.

MANK

You guys after Orson too?

AGENT McCABE

Mr. Mankiewicz.

MANK

Shoot

AGENT McCABE

Are you aware of Mr. Welles' Communist

affiliations?

MANK

Shit, Orson's no pink. He's everything else under

the sun, but he's no pink.

AGENT McCABE

Are you aware of Mr. Welles' Communist

affiliations?

MANK

No, I am not

AGENT McCABE

Do you have any knowledge of Communists working

within the motion picture industry?

AGENT McCABE

Do you have any knowledge of Communists working

within the motion picture industry?

MANK

No

AGENT McCABE

Are you now or have you ever been a member of, or

affiliated with, the Communist Party or any of its

front organizations in the United States?

Thank you for your time, Mr. Mankiewicz. We'll be

in touch.

MANK

(calling after him)

Don't bother, you low-life prick

MARION

Then you explain it to me?!

HEARST

There's nothing to explain

MARION

A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues

and there's nothing to explain?!

HEARST

I will not defend my life to you--

MARION

I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in

a pickle and we gotta talk about it.

HEARST

We are in no "pickle" -- as you would

euphemistically have it.

MARION

You gotta wake up now. Pops.

HEARST

There is nothing to discuss-

MARION

You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the

truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say

it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't

buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g-

goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--

HEARST

You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need

the Tribune to--

MARION

You don't need it! That's the problem you always

think you need everything--

MARION

That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?

HEARST

It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.

MARION

I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.

HEARST

You needn't use that language with me

MARION

Did you need it? Did you need any of it?

HEARST

I wanted it

MARION

There's a different between want and

HEARST

(tightly)

Not for me.

MARION

(frustrated)

But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so

everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!

HEARST

(angrily)

That's right. You've captured me exactly.

Goodnight.

MARION

You will not walk out on me

HEARST

You are repellant when you drink.

MARION

Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--

HEARST

You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't (he

mercilessly mimics her) t-t-t-tolerate it.

MARION

Fuck you, Mr. Kane.

HEARST

(darkly)

I will not have this in my home.

MARION

I just want to understand--

HEARST

(suddenly)

No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like

everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic,

old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped

in his ridiculous

HEARST  (CONT.)

castle -- still fighting old battles he will never

win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--

MARION

I don't want you to--

HEARST

There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a

man who could have been great, but was not.

MARION

When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw

the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going

to make me a star.

CAROLE LOMBARD

And he did.

MARION

When I was making movies I kept begging him to let

me do comedies. Silly stuff, you know. But Pops

doesn't get comedy too well so he kept putting me in

all those godawful p-p-period dramas.

MARION

I did my best but, well, you know me

CAROLE LOMBARD

Sure

MARION

Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is

that I really think I could have been something ...

special.

CAROLE LOMBARD

Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You

were a great star and you had a good run. That

oughta be enough.

MARION

Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not

MARION

You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and

everything?

CAROLE LOMBARD

Uh-huh

MARION

The character that's supposed to be me, Susan

Alexander--

CAROLE LOMBARD

Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--

MARION

But I am That's the killer, honey.

MARION

It's hell when you gotta look back and say,

goddamn, what I could have been.

SHOP OWNER

May I help you?

MARION

I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might

wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important

to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um,

know that--

SHOP OWNER

Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you

Marion Davies?

MARION

Yes.

SHOP OWNER

Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just

saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the

revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine

picture!

MARION

Thank you-

SHOP OWNER

Not one of them today has what you had, Miss

Davies. Not one of them.

MARION

Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--

SHOP OWNER

Of course, of course. How can we be of service?

MARION

As I said I have some j-j-j-j- (she simply can't

get the word out) that I might wish t-t-to sell and

I wanted an estimate--

SHOP OWNER

Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..

SHOP OWNER

(awed)

My Lord. . .

MARION

How much for the lot?

SCHAEFER

What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't

premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with

some bullshit about

WELLES

Then find another theater

SCHAEFER

You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to

open the picture

WELLES

Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or

Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn

circus tents and--!

SCHAEFER

Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the

distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing

with the stockholders in New York who are scared

shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired

myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world

but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll

do what I can to--

WELLES

(desperately)

"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I

SCHAEFER

Well it' s all you've got !

WELLES

(suddenly)

You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury

my movie. They bought you!

SCHAEFER

(turning away)

For Christ's sake, shut up--

WELLES

Why don't you just have the guts to admit it

SCHAEFER

(spinning on him)

How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm

like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and

Warner? Is that what you think--?!

WELLES

It's just that my movie is so-

SCHAEFER

(savagely)

"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your

movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about

that?! Did you ever think about that old man and

Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!

WELLES

SCHAEFER

Do you every think for one second that you might

have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For

cutting and slashing everything in your way so you

can have your goddamn movie?!

WELLES

That soulless monster gets no tears from me.

SCHAEFER

Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that

soulless monster.

SCHAEFER

Recognize

SCHAEFER

It's Tara. From GONE WITH THE WIND

WELLES

It's ... sad

SCHAEFER

Not really. It's only a set, after all Just lumber.

.

SCHAEFER

(quietly)

You know, we make all these pictures, we turn em

out one after another, without thinking most of the

time. Just like making toasters or Packards or

toothpaste. But then sometimes ... something amazing

happens and you get a GONE WITH THE WIND.

SCHAEFER (CONT.)

And no one can ever take that away from you.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER)

... and in financial news, rumors continue to swirl

around the head of publishing baron William Randolph

Hearst. . .

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER, CONT.)

... Sources report that the Hearst Empire is

facing some rocky times ahead as the press lord is

facing mounting debts and shrinking revenues due to

over expansion and fiscal mismanagement that have

resulted in...

MARION

I started out as a gold-digger, ya know But goddamn

if I didn't fall in love with the guy.

MAYER

Mr. Zanuck ... Mr. Warner ... Mr. Cohn Mr. Disney

.. . Mr. Goldwyn . . . Mr. Selznick.

JACK WARNER

He's a fucking punk, why does Hearst give a shit?

MAYER

It's enough that he does

SAM GOLDWYN

Would Louella really do it?

MAYER

In a New York minute

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

I say to hell with Louella and to hell with Hearst!

Bring 'em on. We can take em.

HARRY COHN

We all didn't make GONE WITH THE WIND, ya know.

Some of us gotta look at this checkbook-wise.

MAYER

Who isn't hurting already? All this Jew talk and

these Communist rumors. Look, he's boycotting RKO

ads right now -- but how long before he takes on

Warners or Fox or Columbia?

HARRY COHN

Goddamn right.

MAYER

And if Hearst goes public with all this filthy

private lives stuff, Hollywood's sunk. He's got us

nailed. Dates. Times. Photographs for God's sake.

WALT DISNEY

I don't mean to be funny, but what could he have on

Mickey Mouse?

MAYER

He's got you so tied in with J. Edgar Hoover and

America First that you might as well put on a brown

shirt and kiss those happy little kiddies so-long.

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

(suddenly)

Have any of you actually seen the movie?

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

I have. It's probably the greatest motion picture

ever made. Nothing's going to be the same after

this. With this one movie he's changed the way we

see--

JACK WARNER

Who the fuck cares?

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

I do. And so should all of you--

JACK WARNER

Get off the soapbox--

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

I want no part of this. We should be marching into

George Schaefer's office and standing with him. He's

one of us!

MAYER

David-

DAVID 0. SELZNICK

If I ever got into trouble I'd like to think that

you all would be with me -- not planning to stab me

in the back like a bunch of ... a bunch of ...

producers!

JACK WARNER

(to Mayer)

Your son-in-law meshuaena.

DISNEY

(nervously)

He's got me and Hoover?

JACK WARNER

Relax, Walt, at least he don't have you screwing

Snow White. I got fucking Errol Flynn on my payroll!

SAM GOLDWYN

(to Mayer)

You're a smart man, L.B. I suspect you would not

have called us here without a plan. Give over.

MAYER

We will buy the movie and we will destroy it.

MAYER

We will assemble a fund between us -- privately,

'not studio money -- we will assemble this fund and

we will go to George Schaefer and we will buy the

negative and every print of CITIZEN KANE and we will

burn them.

MAYER

If I do not hear an objection to this agenda in the

next five seconds I will assume the motion has

carried.

MAYER

Very well, my associates will be in touch to

arrange payment. Thank you for your time.

LEWIS You will retain some editorial control over the remaining

MARION

(quietly)

Mr. Hearst spent his life collecting that art.

LEWIS

(ignoring her)

We've been in touch with Gimbels in New York and

they've agreed to hold a special sale. They're

giving over an entire floor for the merchandise.

You'll have to go there in person to sign the bill

of sale, by the way.

HEARST

(softly, not turning)

I'll have to sell the animals.

LEWIS

And we don't know whether we'll be able to retain

the castle. The land has some capital and we might

keep it on as an investment. Maybe break it up into

smaller units for housing.

HEARST

(to Lewis)

When will it come out? When will the public know?

LEWIS

We can't keep it a secret, sir. Once we announce

the Gimbels sale and start liquidating the assets.

MARION

(pained)

This is your whole life. Pops. Don't do it. We'll

find another way..

EMCEE

Next up we have a real treat. It's Orson Welles.

Now, during the rehearsal for the benefit tonight

Orson banished everyone from the club so he could

proceed in utmost secrecy. But you all know how

Orson is!

EMCEE

So, lets give a big round of applause for Mr. Orson

Welles and Miss Rita Hayworth.

WELLES

"I'll buy everything I wear at Saks. I'll print

gossip and I'll call it facts

RITA HAYWORTH

"Swear like a trooper, Live in a stupor--

WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH

"Just disgustingly rich!

WELLES

"I'll make money and I'll make it quick, Starting

little wars I think are slick. Smother her in

sables, Like Betty Grable's-- Just disgustingly

rich.  "I'll build a castle, That'll cost a passel.

And as a resident, I will pan the president I'll

aspire, Higher and Higher. "I'll get married and

I'll buy a girl, So darn pretty that your head will

swirl

RITA HAYWORTH

"Swimming in highballs-- Stewed to the eyeballs--

WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH

"Just disgustingly rich!

SCHAEFER

(seriously)

He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.

MANK

Yeah, ain't it swell?

WELLES

"Ev'ry summer I will sail the sea, On my little

yacht the Normandie, Pet my little dachshund

friends, Kiss Louella's big rear end, Just

disgustingly rich.

RITA HAYWORTH

"He'll be photographed with Myrna Loy, Just to

prove he is a glamour boy.

WELLES

"Perfumed and scented, Slightly demented-- Just

disgustingly rich

RITA HAYWORTH

"I'll get my capers, Into his papers. Hoping his

folly would Lead me out to Hollywood. I'll aspire,

Higher and higher.

WELLES AND RITA HAYWORTH

"In the funnies and the valentines, We'll be

pictured drinking Ballantine's. Dopey and screwy,

Voting for Dewey.  Just disgustingly-- Too, too

disgustingly-- Riiiiich! "

WELLES

(happily)

George- -!

SCHAEFER

(brutally)

This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how

many people RKO employs?! You know how many people

depend on what we do for a living?!

WELLES

I really think you're

SCHAEFER

You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death-

wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down

with you!

WELLES

It was a -joke, George

SCHAEFER

There are no jokes! There are people making a

living. There is food on the table!

SCHAEFER

Where did this money come from?

MAYER

It came.

MAYER

800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget

and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a

profit on the deal.

SCHAEFER

Very generous

MAYER

And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and

every existing print.

SCHAEFER

To do what?

MAYER

That's for me to decide.

SCHAEFER

You're going to destroy it

MAYER

No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man

kicks it.

SCHAEFER

You're lying to me.

MAYER

We already made the same offer to the stockholders.

SCHAEFER

You talked to New York?

MAYER

Yes

SCHAEFER

You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?

MAYER

Yes

SCHAEFER

Get out

MAYER

You're bettin' on an inside straight this time.

You'll never pull it off.

SCHAEFER

Get out.

MAYER

This picture, George, it'll just break your heart.

BUNNY BERIGAN

"I've flown around the world in a plane, I've

settled revolutions in Spain, And the North Pole I

have charted, Still I can't get started with you...

BUNNY BERIGAN

"On the golf course I'm under par, Metro Goldwyn

has asked me to star, I've got a house, a show

place, Still I can't get no place with you.

BUNNY BERIGAN

"Cause you're so supreme, Lyrics I write of you, I

dream, dream day and night of you And I scheme just

for the sight of you, Baby, what good does it do...?

BUNNY BERIGAN

"I've been consulted by Franklin D. Greta Garbo has

had me to tea, Still I'm broken hearted Cause I

can't get started with you.

HEARST

(gently)

Ah, Miss Davies, the times we have seen

TOLAND

See, this is the Great Salt Lake -- we do the

baptism here.

MANK

Great scene where John the Baptist pulls your head

out of the water and says, "Look up, and behold your

destiny"

WELLES

Is that from one of the Gospels?

MANK

Kinda.

WELLES

George! Enter And Behold

WELLES

You're not still mad at me, I hope

SCHAEFER

No, we're jake. But listen-

WELLES

Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've

found natural locations for the whole story--

SCHAEFER

Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found

somewhere to premiere KANE but--

WELLES

I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did

Radio City come crawling back?

SCHAEFER

The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something

else.

SCHAEFER

I think you better sit down

WELLES

(evenly)

I don't want to sit

SCHAEFER

The bosses -- the other studios -- they want to buy

the film and destroy it.

SCHAEFER

They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the

negative and all the prints.

SCHAEFER

And they went to the stockholders in New York.

MANK

(quietly)

Oh God.

SCHAEFER

I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and...

Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as

Welles looks at Schaefer

WELLES

YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS

HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO

SELL IT!?

MANK

This ain't George's doing--!

WELLES

I PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT PICTURE -- EVERYTHING I'VE

BEEN -- EVERYTHING I COULD BE---IT'S CITIZEN KANE! -

- IT'S ALL CITIZEN KANE!

WELLES

Let . . . me . . . talk to them. . .

MAN

Old man Hearst owned this and I'm getting it for

two bits I

COMFORTABLE.

HEARST

I can't sell this. How much are they asking?

MARION

(gently)

Pops ... let it go. Just ... let it go

HEARST

Yes, I think I shall.

WELLES

Six of spades

WELLES

Six of spades

WELLES

Today.

WELLES

Today a man from Germany invaded Greece. He has

already swallowed Poland and Denmark and Norway and

Belgium. He is bombing London as I speak. Everywhere

this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of

his subjects. He sews yellow stars onto their

lapels. He takes their voices.

SCHAEFER

We open on May 1st.

SCHAEFER

Orson, what you said in there. Did you mean it?

WELLES

Does it matter? They believed it

SCHAEFER

Orson.

SCHAEFER

Yes. It matters.

WELLES

Mr. Hearst, we've met once before, my name is Orson

Welles and I've got a movie opening tomorrow night

at the Palace. I would be pleased to get you

tickets.

HEARST

I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?

WELLES

Do you?

HEARST

Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my

head I could give you a hundred others. I have been

swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a

belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned,

undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private

lives should not be public property.

WELLES

Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name

and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip.

In your papers you taught the world how to look

under every rock. I learned at the knee of the

master.

HEARST

So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind

of sad future are we two making? A future where men

will do anything to sell their newspapers and their

movies? A future where no price is too high for fame

and power? When we will all scratch each other to

pieces just to be heard?

WELLES

CHARLES FOSTER KANE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED I

SCHAEFER

They're cutting us dead, every goddamn one.

WELLES

It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.

SCHAEFER

Happy birthday.

MANK

Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants

to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.

SCHAEFER

Herman.

MANK

(lighting a cigar)

So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high

muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human

sacrifice.

WELLES

You gonna watch?

MANK

Hell, I know how it ends.

(He calls to a passing stranger)

Hey, Rosebud's the sled!

WELLES

Mank!

MANK

Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you,

not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch

of New York actors.

SCHAEFER

(pained)

Oh God. . .

WELLES

Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have

I ever lied to you?

SCHAEFER

You know something, Orson, you haven't done

anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But,

ya know, I'd do it again in a second.

WELLES

It was fun, wasn't it?

SCHAEFER

(quietly)

It was the best, kid

WELLES

So, on to the Life Of Christ!

SCHAEFER

Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.

MANK

Shit

WELLES

George...

SCHAEFER

Forget it. Cause you know something..

WELLES

(softly)

What have I done?

MANK

Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by

the morning. Let's get a drink.

WELLES

But the picture...

MANK

(quietly)

Kid, you know how it ends too. It ends sadly.

"KANE"

"Rosebud...

WELLES

You know, all this nightmare we went through with

Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably

no one will ever remember the picture anyway.

MANK

Yeah, you're probably right.

MANK

I'll tell ya something, kid. When you make your

masterpiece at 26 it's a bitch. I mean. where do you

go from here?

WELLES

Will burn. Burn up. Burn out.  But oh, what a flame

WELLES

Cheers.
