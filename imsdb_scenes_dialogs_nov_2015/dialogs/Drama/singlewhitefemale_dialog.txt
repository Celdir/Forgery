SAM (voice over)

So how many kids do we want ?

ALLISON (voice over)

I dunno. What's the statistical norm ?

SAM (voice over)

You and your statistics.

SAM (voice over)

One point two.

ALLISON (voice over)

Okay, then I want two point two.

ALLISON

And I want them to look like you.

SAM

Poor kids.

SAM

So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer

tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.

ALLISON

Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?

SAM

As opposed to a fake one ?

ALLISON

You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the

big ceremony with too hundred people.

SAM

That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have

any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a

steam room in the wild. Horseback.

ALLISON

Naked skydiving ?

SAM

Naked skydiving !

ALLISON

It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know.

I've not been in New York long enough to know very many

people.

SAM

Except me.

ALLISON

Oh, you're invited.

ALLISON

And my friend Graham upstairs.

SAM

It won't be long before you know half the people in New

York. People like you, you know... but I found you first.

ALLISON

You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that

ever happened to me.

ALLISON

Hello ?... Hold on a second.

ALLISON

Sam, it's your ex-wife.

SAM

What ?

ALLISON

It's Lisa.

SAM

Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now.

SAM

I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

ALLISON

It's where you live. She's entitled.

SAM

Don't... don't answer it.

SAM

Why does she do this ?

ALLISON

Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that.

LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Hello, Sam. Oh, damn... Would you pick up the phone,

please ? Hello ?... Please, don't do this to me.

SAM (voice over)

Lisa...

LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this

afternoon...

SAM (voice over)

Yeah... Lisa... Can we talk about this tomorrow ?

LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then...

SAM (voice over and yelling)

Allie, Allie, I don't know how you shut that thing off.

LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

You said you were going to call.

SAM

Huh-huh...

SAM (voice over)

Okay ... goodbye.

ALLISON

I take it back. She's not entitled.

SAM (voice over)

I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie.

I swear to God.

ALLISON (voice over)

Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now.

SAM (voice over from the air vent)

She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our

divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been

drinking.

ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

I don't want to hear this !

SAM (voice over from the air vent)

I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't

happen again.

ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

(a few words incomprehensible)

I am supposed to trust you now ?

GRAHAM

It's 4 a.m. !

ALLISON (voice over through the door)

It's me, Graham.

GRAHAM

Allie ?

ALLISON

I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be

alone tonight... so I came up here.

ALLISON

Thanks.

GRAHAM

Allie, I let you sleep.

ALLISON

What time is it ?

GRAHAM

About ten.

ALLISON

Oh, my God

ALLISON

I've got a meeting. It's really important.

ALLISON

Hi !

MITCHELL

Hi !

ALLISON

I'm sorry, I'm a little late.

MITCHELL

No, no, it's worth the wait.

ALLISON

Thank you.

ALLISON

So...

ALLISON

You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an

expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones'

software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has.

MITCHELL

Who do I get to run it ?

ALLISON

I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the

quote.

MITCHELL

Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen.

ALLISON

Best for last.

ALLISON

I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark.

MITCHELL

Here's where I was thinking of playing.

MITCHELL

It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I

made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one.

ALLISON

No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a

friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all

the credit and she didn't like me telling her so.

MITCHELL

Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You

walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled

apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your

client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you

say you are.

MITCHELL

But that is the only way to prove it.

ALLISON

Well, I could go for something...

MITCHELL

No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final

offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about

it...

ALLISON

I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.

MITCHELL

I look forward to it.

THE ANSWERING MACHINE

No messages.

GRAHAM

What is this ? A song cue ? You're Nobody Till Somebody

Loves You.

ALLISON

It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying

those books like Cooking for One. It's just too

depressing.

GRAHAM

There are worse things than being on your own, you know.

ALLISON

Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.

GRAHAM

Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do

with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy

interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a

career... or a guy to interfere with it.

ALLISON

You'll find someone again.

GRAHAM

Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I

don't.

ALLISON

I know that. I can do it on my own.

GRAHAM

Absolutely.

ALLISON

I'll just get a room-mate.

GRAHAM

You could always call him, Allie.

ALLISON

Not if I have a room-mate.

ALLISON (voice over)

The managers couldn't really know you want to live there.

ALLISON

Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't

come on the lease.

THE BUTCH GIRL

Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get

in here. Are you proper with tools ?

TALKATIVE APPLICANT

I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the

instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have

the sense that I survived something. All my therapists

think so.

TALKATIVE APPLICANT

Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning,

anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault.

PERFECT APPLICANT

I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please

give me a call.

SAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE

Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ?

ALLISON

Oh !... Hi !

HEDRA

Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison

Jones ?

ALLISON

Yes... I'm Allie.

HEDRA

Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning.

HEDRA

Are you sure you're okay ?

ALLISON

You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came

back tomorrow ?

HEDRA

Why don't you just... sit down.

ALLISON

No, I'm fine.

HEDRA

I'll make you some tea.

ALLISON

I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all.

ALLISON

It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...

ALLISON

I use a wrench.

ALLISON

Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry.

HEDRA (voice over)

If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli.

ALLISON

Oh, yes...

ALLISON

Hedra... that's unusual.

HEDRA

I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling

you.

ALLISON

Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.

HEDRA

Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to

now, right ?

HEDRA

They're dry.

HEDRA

Here.

ALLISON

Thanks.

ALLISON

Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's

the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.

HEDRA

Oh !...

HEDRA

Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things

up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being

bound again, and then have things change. It would just be

awkward.

ALLISON

Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that

my faucets will work. When can you move in ?

HEDRA

No, really ?

ALLISON

Congratulations.

HEDRA

Thank you.

ALLISON

I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...

HEDRA

A friend ?

ALLISON

Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real

friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with

privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door...

HEDRA

Yeah.

ALLISON

No problem.

HEDRA

I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good

for you.

ALLISON

Anyway.

HEDRA

Wow !

HEDRA

Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh.

ALLISON

Laundry room.

ALLISON

I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay

in the day, but, still, lock yourself in.

HEDRA

This one ?

ALLISON

No, that's mail key.

HEDRA

This is creepy.

ALLISON

Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old.

ALLISON

Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this

screwdriver.

ALLISON

Excuse me.

THE TENANT

Which floor ?

ALLISON

Eleven

HEDRA

Fourteen, please.

ALLISON

Okay.

HEDRA

Look what I found.

HEDRA

I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.

HEDRA

Allie, it's Sam.

HEDRA

Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's

just so New York.

ALLISON

I think you look very comfortable.

HEDRA

Yeah, I never know what looks good.

ALLISON

Oh !... I think that looks nice

HEDRA

Yes ?

ALLISON

But I found this.

HEDRA

Oh !

ALLISON

I think you'd look great with that.

HEDRA

Okay

HEDRA

Hey ! What do you think ?

ALLISON

I think you should take them.

HEDRA

Oh God, you like them ?

ALLISON

Well, I think they go great with that dress.

HEDRA

You take them

ALLISON

Well...

HEDRA

I'll just borrow them when I want to.

ALLISON

God! I didn't know you were home. I was...

ALLISON

I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been

here two weeks and I'm already in your room.

(ironically)

I was just about to go through your drawers !

HEDRA

That smells nice on you.

ALLISON

Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try

that.

HEDRA

Oh God, no. anything you want... you want.

HEDRA

Go ahead. Share and share alike.

ALLISON

Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child.

Do you have... a big family ?

HEDRA

Hu-uh... There's just me.

HEDRA

I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was

stillborn.

ALLISON

Oh, that's so sad.

HEDRA

I grew up like a part of me was missing.

HEDRA

Allie ! God !

HEDRA

It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you ?

ALLISON

Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like

that.

ALLISON

Oh no no...

HEDRA

Shhh !...

HEDRA

They look beautiful on you.

ALLISON

But I can't take these.

HEDRA

It's housewarming.

ALLISON

Thanks, they're great.

ALLISON

Excuse me.

HEDRA

Oops !

ALLISON

Hello ?...

SAM (voice over on the phone)

... Talk to me...

ALLISON

No, Sam.

SAM (voice over on the phone)

Why not ?... Why not ?...

ALLISON

No, it's not a good time.

ALLISON (voice over from the corridor)

I'm not ready to see you. You're just going on something

that's over.

ALLISON

No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's

somebody here right now...

ALLISON

All right ?... Okay... Bye.

HEDRA

Why don't we order some Chinese ?

ANSWERING MACHINE

Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank

you.

SAM'S VOICE ON   THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Allie, are you   there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen.

Please, please   call me back. This is torture for me. I know

you need me as   much as I need you. I love you. I'll do

anything for you for us to get back together, just call me.

HEDRA

Buddy !

HEDRA

Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her

up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll

let you stay.

Yoo-hoo !

ANSWERING MACHINE

No messages.

HEDRA

I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him

away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back

to-morrow.

ALLISON

Well, I hope they meant it.

HEDRA

Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I

was little.

HEDRA

Tomorrow, okay. I promise.

ALLISON

Oh ! Come on.

ALLISON

Okay. Come on. Shhh !

HEDRA

You're working so hard.

ALLISON (voice over)

Myerson better refers some clients to me.

HEDRA (voice over)

He will, you're the best.

ALLISON

God, Hedy, thanks. I never would've got it done without

you.

HEDRA

I love helping.

HEDRA

Wait... Wait...

HEDRA

Oh yeah ! Family portrait.

ALLISON

Ready ?

HEDRA

Yeah.

THE WOMAN IN THE FILM ON TV

I lived a few weeks while you loved me. Goodbye, David.

GRAHAM

Ready to kill her yet ?

ALLISON

Who, Hedy ?

GRAHAM

Hm-mm !

ALLISON

No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again.

GRAHAM

I can tell. I was worried for a while that you were so

down. You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife.

ALLISON

You were great, Graham. I just had to spend some time with

her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been

working like crazy. I promised I'm not avoiding you.

GRAHAM

Oh, I've got you cornered now. I've been meaning to come

down and see you. I was on my way to ask you something.

GRAHAM

Will you cat sit again ? I have to go to Boston this week-

end for my cousin's wedding.

ALLISON

Fine. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.

GRAHAM

Hey, I've made you a set. You know which one to try. And

ignore the litter box this time, I do.

ALLISON

It's so cruel. We'll be fine.

GRAHAM

You know, I think I saw her the other day, your room-mate.

You were leaving the building. Then I thought it was you.

Your backpack. This jacket. I chased her down. But it was

someone else. Someone very nervous.

ALLISON

Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people

knowing she's living in the building. I would've had you

down to meet her... but she's shy.

ALLISON

Well.

ALLISON

Friday ?

GRAHAM

That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back.

ALLISON

Hey, I thought you'd be at work.

HEDRA

No.

ALLISON

Don't tell me we have the same belt.

HEDRA

Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you.

ALLISON

You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs.

HEDRA

Oh, they're great.

ALLISON

I had to get them. They're so great.

HEDRA

Can I just talk to you for a second...

ALLISON

Buddy !

HEDRA

I tried to let you know.

ALLISON

What are you doing here ? Hedy !

SAM

But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay.

SAM

I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you.

HEDRA

I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me...

HEDRA

Okay.

ALLISON

Why can't you just leave me alone ?

SAM

You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I

don't exist.

ALLISON

Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it

easier on me ?

SAM

But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was

wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You

don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters.

ALLISON

Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would

I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ?

Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away.

SAM

Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you

just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't

one of them.

ALLISON

Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I

wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just

didn't get it.

SAM

Well, I sent it with the keys.

ALLISON

Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ?

SAM

Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you.

I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me

a second chance.

ALLISON

You really hurt me, Sam.

SAM

Shhh !

THE LADY CUSTOMER

Excuse me, can you tell me where the biography section is ?

HEDRA

Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall.

THE LADY CUSTOMER

Okay.

ALLISON'S ANSWERING MACHINE (voice over)

Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank

you.

HEDRA

Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling to see if you're okay.

HEDRA (voice over on the answering machine)

Call me at work. Yeah. Okay. My number's on the fridge.

Okay, bye.

SAM

Say... Next month, that would give her enough time.

ALLISON

I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do.

I'm sure she'll understand.

HOTEL CLERK

Good evening, Mister Rawson.

JAMES STEWART (playing his character in the movie)

I have an idea I must be in love with you. Has it hit you

that way ?

HEDRA

Hey ! It's not for you !

JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)

Would you like it to go on for always ?

FEMALE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE (voice over from the TV set)

How does anything go on for always ?

JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set)

Well, one likes to think some things do.

HEDRA

Where the hell have you been ?

ALLISON

God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ?

HEDRA

I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from

you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might

as well come in here, so it calm down.

ALLISON

Sorry, I guess I just didn't think.

HEDRA

No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know.

This is New York. Things happen.

ALLISON

Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're

making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here.

ALLISON

Hey, are you okay ?

HEDRA

Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched

things up with Sam, huh ?

ALLISON

Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer.

HEDRA

Is that an engagement ring ?

ALLISON

Right.

HEDRA

Beautiful ring.

ALLISON

Thanks.

HEDRA

Really great.

HEDRA

I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and

I'll be alone.

ALLISON

No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean,

God, if I can...

HEDRA

Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look !

HEDRA

Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have

this great personality. You have this great style. You're

running your own business. You're always going to find

someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you

wouldn't.

HEDRA

Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So...

I have to move out, right ?... No ?

ALLISON

Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I

know you just spent a lot on furniture.

HEDRA

Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You

promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what...

ALLISON

Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam.

Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll

find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll

see, we'll figure something out. Okay ?

MITCHELL (voice over)

They tell me they're nervous.

ALLISON (voice over)

Of course, they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to

be sold.

ALLISON

Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something

special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you

know. Open bar, open minds. That's F night.

MITCHELL

I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you

tonight after I check on some things.

ALLISON

Great.

MITCHELL

8796, Knox. Knox ? What's this Knox ?

ALLISON

Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That

was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one.

MITCHELL

Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed.

ALLISON

Well, maybe you start spreading the word.

MITCHELL

You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you

any more.

ALLISON

Great. Press enter. That's it.

ALLISON

You thirsty ?

SAM

No.

ALLISON

I'll be right back, okay.

HEDRA

Well, you'd know more about that than I would.

HEDRA

Oh, hi !

SAM (voice over from the bed)

Allie, do you want a sip ?

HEDRA

Oh well... Well I think I'll turn in. Goodnight, Allie.

HEDRA

Goodnight, Sam.

HEDRA (voice over)

They're ready.

SAM

Right, just a minute.

HEDRA

They'll get cold.

SAM

All right, all right.

SAM (voice over)

No, no, Rawson is a Norse name.

SAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over

while Allison was opening the door)

Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation.

SAM

Hey !

HEDRA

Hi !

ALLISON

We going ?

HEDRA

Scrambled or fried ?

ALLISON (whispering)

This is fine.

SAM (voice over)

Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if

you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can

wait till I get back.

SAM

Why don't we get away together ? Drive to Box Camp ?

HEDRA

Buddy, come here, boy.

HEDRA (voice over)

Come on, three's a crowd, sweetie.

ALLISON

All right, Hedy, he's fine.

(in a much lower voice, for Sam's ears only)

Poor guy's doesn't who's who anymore.

SAM

Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a

car...

ALLISON

No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good

sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ?

HEDRA

You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.

ALLISON

You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough

already.

HEDRA

Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.

HEDRA

Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust

me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ?

ALLISON

Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think

we'll be eating out.

HEDRA

Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck.

HEDRA

Goodbye.

HEDRA

Buddy, come here.

HEDRA

Come here, sweetie.

HEDRA

I know... I know.

HEDRA

Buddy, come !

HEDRA (angry voice)

Come !

HEDRA (calmer voice)

Fine.

SAM

But this is half the size for twice the price from your

apartment.

ALLISON

It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice.

SAM

Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this.

SAM

Do you think we can smoke her out ?

ALLISON

This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think

I'm her only friend.

THE WOMAN ON THE BALCONY

My God, what happened ?

ALLISON (yelling)

Hedy !

ALLISON (screaming and crying)

He's dead ! Buddy's dead !

HEDRA

What ?

ALLISON (crying)

You left the window open. How could you do that ?

HEDRA

But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it

this morning.

SAM

I thought I did.

HEDRA

It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for

breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault.

HEDRA

Allie !

SAM (voice over)

Allie !

SAM

Allie !

SAM

Thanks, that pill helped.

HEDRA

Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ?

SAM

Well, she wants me to.

HEDRA

If I'd just let you finish your work this morning...

SAM

Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ?

SAM

Shh !

ALLISON

Hello ?... Hi, Mitch...

ALLISON

What ?

ALLISON

God ! I know... I'm... No, I'm just... I'm just running a

little late.

ALLISON

I didn't forget. I dunno... Just hold them till five,

okay ? Thanks.

MITCHELL (voice over)

You were terrific...

MITCHELL

...but you know that, don't you ?

ALLISON

Thank you.

MITCHELL

And here, I thought all the guys would resist you. As if

anyone ever could.

ALLISON

Oh no, here, I've got to go. I'm just cleaning a bit.

MITCHELL

Hold it. Hold it. Not so fast. Now everybody under me knows

more than I do. I hate that.

ALLISON

Well... Block up some time for me next week. Then... it's

just a little late tonight.

MITCHELL

Oh, please, please, just a taste.

MITCHELL

Something simple. Right now.

ALLISON

Okay... Something simple.

ALLISON

All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff,

but it does come in handy.

MITCHELL (voice over)

Huh-huh.

ALLISON

Okay. Enter the vendor's name.

MITCHELL

Oh !... Vendor...

MITCHELL

J-o-n-e-s... All..i...son.

ALLISON

ALLISON (voice over)

See, here you go. Contract price, Payments to date,

Balance outstanding.

MITCHELL

Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last

Friday.

ALLISON

That's all right. Barbara will handle that.

MITCHELL

Not till I give her the word.

ALLISON

Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.

MITCHELL

So far.

ALLISON

But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a

little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now,

if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues.

MITCHELL

I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself.

MITCHELL

Top her ?

ALLISON

What are you doing ?

MITCHELL

That's just that you're so tight.

ALLISON

Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.

ALLISON

Mitch...

MITCHELL

Hey, look...

MITCHELL

I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good

girl. We have nothing to prove any more.

MITCHELL

This is your last chance to play before you're an old

married lady.

ALLISON

Let me turn around, okay ?

MITCHELL

That's better. That's better.

MITCHELL

Just a second... A second...

MITCHELL

Fucking bitch !

HEDRA (voice over)

Here. Take this.

ALLISON

I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so

humiliating.

HEDRA (voice over)

You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't

care how nice they seem. You always fall for that.

ALLISON

But what I did... It was like something inside taking over.

It was scary.

HEDRA

No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He

should pay for this.

ALLISON

He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to

eventually.

HEDRA

What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking

about getting even.

ALLISON

You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the

money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and

now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square

one.

HEDRA

Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?

ALLISON

What can I do ?

HEDRA

Oh, Allie...

HEDRA

Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How

he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died.

HEDRA

Especially when it was his fault.

HEDRA

Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ?

ALLISON

Who are you calling ?

HEDRA

Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll

take the call.

ALLISON

Who are you talking ?

HEDRA

Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your

business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If

you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is

fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you.

HEDRA

Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now.

ALLISON

Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy, we really have to talk.

HEDRA (voice over)

Allie, please, I have a surprise for you.

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy !

ALLISON

Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today.

HEDRA

What ?

HEDRA

No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel

better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go.

HEDRA

Let's go.

ALLISON

Oh, Hedy.

HEDRA

It'll be fine, come on.

ALLISON

Thank you.

ALLISON

You've got to be kidding.

ALLISON

You just should've asked first.

HEDRA

Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.

ALLISON

Can I have the Consumer Market, please.

NEWSPAPER STAND ATTENDANT

Sure.

HEDRA

This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind.

ALLISON

Thank you... please.

HEDRA (voice over)

I'm going to take a shower.

Sam !

DEAR ALLIE,

I KNOW HOW MUCH I HU

AND I KNOW HOW LITTLE MY

CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

BUT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE

WHAT WE HAD, GIVE ME THE CHANCE

TO SAY THEM.

YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I

TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE

HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.

I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I

DON'T HEAR FROM YOU.

I LOVE YOU, ALLIE

SAM

DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M

HEDRA

Do you want me to fix you something before I go ?

ALLISON

Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham.

HEDRA

Okay.

ALLISON

Okay.

HEDRA

I love myself like this.

ALLISON

Have fun.

HEDRA

Yeah.

HEDRA

I love myself like this.

HEDRA

Taxi !

HEDRA

Hey !

ALLISON

Taxi !

ALLISON (voice over)

Don't lose her.

ALLISON

It's very important. She has something of mine.

THE WOMAN

Do you want to play ?

ALLISON

No, thanks.

HEDRA

Come on, Jim.

THE BARTENDER

Allie !

THE BARTENDER (voice over)

Hey, Allie ! Regular or diet ?

HEDRA

Diet.

JIM

Something's different.

HEDRA

Yes.

JIM

Yes.

HEDRA (voice over)

Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend.

GRAHAM

Jesus, Allie, what is it ?

ALLISON

God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me

what to do.

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA

I'm home.

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA

God...

ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a

shoebox in her room.

ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)

Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at

birth. It was in an accident when she was nine.

ALLISON

And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do

something.

GRAHAM

Get rid of her.

GRAHAM (voice over from the air vent)

Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you

have to get her out of the place.

ALLISON

You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

ALLISON

I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she

obviously needs help.

GRAHAM

She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight.

ALLISON (voice over)

It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the

only one she has. Someone like her parent.

GRAHAM

Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the

police, okay ?

ALLISON

That was very impressive.

GRAHAM

I can be butch when I have to. I got it from my mother.

GRAHAM (voice over)

Look, if you worry about her, I've got a friend who's a

shrink. Maybe he can help her.

ALLISON (voice over)

Oh God ! Maybe after I talk to her, she just leaves.

GRAHAM (voice over)

Do you want to sleep here tonight ?

ALLISON (voice over)

Oh, don't tempt me. No, I just needed to talk it out.

ALLISON

Thanks.

ALLISON (voice over)

She's not going to chase me out of my own place.

GRAHAM (voice over)

When's Sam coming back ?

ALLISON

Oh, tomorrow.

GRAHAM

That's good.

ALLISON

Yeah.

GRAHAM

Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting

our hair down... Those old air vents between our apartments

carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing.

ALLISON

Oh... What do you hear ?

ALLISON

Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry.

GRAHAM

Big deal. I am sorry. I should've mentioned it sooner.

ALLISON

I'm so sorry.

GRAHAM

You're sure you want to go down there ?

ALLISON

Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.

ALLISON

Thank you for the tea. I'll see you tomorrow.

GRAHAM

Okay.

ALLISON

Hedy ?

ALLISON

Hedy ?

ALLISON

Hedy ?

GRAHAM (voice over)

This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought.

No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone.

GRAHAM

I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No,

I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or

paranoid, whatever. I don't know...

GRAHAM

I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from

there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better

than I can. Right, okay.

GRAHAM

Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from

us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this.

GRAHAM

Carmen...

GRAHAM

Allie !

HEDRA

Goodnight.

GRAHAM

Hedy ?

HEDRA

I'm sorry...

GRAHAM

Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We

just want to get you some help.

HEDRA

No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong.

GRAHAM

Okay, take it easy.

HEDRA

I'm sorry, I didn't do anything.

GRAHAM

No problem.

ALLISON

Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison

Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen.

I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of

stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I

really, really would not get into this on the answering

machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm

sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4.

ALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone)

I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called.

ALLISON

Oh, thank you.

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy ?

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy ?

HEDRA

What ?

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy, are you all right ?

HEDRA

I can't hear you.

ALLISON

It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been

in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some

tea ? Camomile.

HEDRA

Yeah... that'd be great.

HEDRA (voice over)

I'm not feeling really well.

HEDRA

Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.

ALLISON

Are you crampy ? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. We

could talk.

HEDRA

About what ?

ALLISON

About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves...

ALLISON

...It's just crazy keeping two places like this.

HEDRA

Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement

so you could make sure you can trust him again.

ALLISON

Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but

it is.

HEDRA

Huh-huh... It's me, isn't it ? I'll change, Allie. I can

change.

ALLISON

No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate.

It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us

to start our lives together.

HEDRA

Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And

when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause...

I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !

HEDRA

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA

Hello ?

ALLISON

Is it Sam ?

HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)

Ellen, is that you ? Talk to me, or your mother. Honey, we

miss you. We want you to come home.

HEDRA (with a deep menacing voice)

Don't call here again.

HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone)

Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't

come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come.

HEDRA

Obscene phone call. New York !

HEDRA

Find someone else, jerk !

ALLISON

I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in

tonight.

HEDRA

Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's

busy.

HEDRA

I'm sorry, Allie.

HEDRA

It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I

just... I don't want you making a mistake.

ALLISON

I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in

touch.

HEDRA

Sure.

HEDRA (whispering)

Hello ?

SAM (voice over on the phone)

Allie ?

HEDRA

No, it's Hedy.

HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

Where are you ? Where are you ?

SAM

Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ?

HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

Yeah...

HEDRA

It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ?

SAM (voice over on the phone)

No, tell her to surprise me.

HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

Okay.

SAM

Okay.

HEDRA (voice over on the phone)

Okay, I'll tell her.

SAM

Goodnight, honey.

HEDRA

Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.

SAM (sleepy voice)

Allie, Allie... what are you doing ?

SAM

Oh... Oh... Jesus !... Oh... Gee...

SAM

Allie ?

HEDRA

No, not Allie.

HEDRA

Hey !

HEDRA

Hey, sleepy guy.

HEDRA

I knew it.

SAM

Knew what ?

HEDRA

I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be

faithful. And now she'll know.

SAM

She'll know what ?

SAM

That you came up here and pretended to be her ? My God,

what is this hair ? What is this supposed to mean ? You're

in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume! For Christ-

sake !

HEDRA

You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care.

Well, I think she should know that.

SAM

You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you ?

HEDRA

Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship.

SAM

She can't... she can't stand you, for Christ-sake !

HEDRA

That's not true.

SAM

Oh, bullshit !

HEDRA

Huh-huh.

SAM

You're too needy. You're always cleaning. You're constantly

in her face.

HEDRA

She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost

raped her ?

SAM

What ?

HEDRA

Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or

screwing someone.

SAM

She never said a word to me about that.

HEDRA

That's right, she told me.

HEDRA

So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We

lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're

best friends.

SAM

You're nuts, you know that ? Yes... I think you're out of

your skull, that's right.

HEDRA

Yeah, well, sticks and stones...

HEDRA

Sam !

SAM

Don't touch me !

HEDRA

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I

won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and

call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or

something. And I won't say a word, okay ?

SAM

Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart,

because I'm going to tell her myself.

HEDRA (yelling)

No !

SAM

Fucking bitch !

HEDRA (softly)

Hey !... Hey !

HOTEL CLERK

Goodnight, Miss Jones.

HEDRA

Goodnight.

ALLISON

Hedy ?... Hedy ?

ALLISON

Hedy ?

HEDRA

Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start.

ALLISON

No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today.

HEDRA

Oh, there, I think that's it.

HEDRA

I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the

cage downstairs.

HEDRA

That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean...

You know... I mean...

ALLISON

Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work

out.

HEDRA

Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here.

ALLISON

I'll help.

ALLISON

We can have breakfast when you get back.

Identification of the victim, a white male of around 30

years of age is pending notification of next of kin.

Sam Rawson's room, please, room 6-12..

HOTEL CLERK (voice over on the phone)

I'm sorry, there's been an accident. I think you should

speak to the police.

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA

What are you doing down there ?

ALLISON

Oh... I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing.

I hope I'm not pregnant.

HEDRA

Let me help you.

ALLISON

Oh, that's all right, I'm fine.

HEDRA

I'll get some water.

HEDRA

Wait !

HEDRA

Drink some.

HEDRA

Okay ?

HEDRA

Feeling better ?

ALLISON

Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now.

HEDRA

I thought you said breakfast ?

ALLISON

Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out.

HEDRA

Dressed like that?

ALLISON

I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He

called while you were out.

HEDRA

Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear

more than that.

ALLISON

Maybe you're right.

HEDRA

Oh...

HEDRA (voice over from the hall)

Leave the door open so we can talk.

HEDRA

You know why I think you're sick ?

HEDRA

You're upset about Sam.

HEDRA

You know Sam's dead, don't you ?

HEDRA

Yeah, we don't have much time.

ALLISON (crying)

You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ?

ALLISON (crying)

You couldn't have him !

ALLISON

Why ?... Why ?

HEDRA

Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit

out of me because I wanted to tell you.

HEDRA

You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it.

HEDRA

Okay, come on. The police will be here soon.

ALLISON

But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I

know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy.

HEDRA

I know. I was you.

HEDRA

Who is this Hedy anyway ?

HEDRA

No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even

a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy.

You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away.

ALLISON

Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you.

We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and

they'll explain it to the police, or something.

HEDRA

No.

HEDRA

Why are you making me do this ?

HEDRA

We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble

without me. But I'm not going to leave you.

HEDRA

That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go.

Up ! Up ! Up !

HEDRA

Go ! Go-go-go !

HEDRA

No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already

involved.

ALLISON

Nobody's home.

HEDRA

Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go !

ALLISON

He must be sleeping. We were up late last night.

ALLISON

Graham ?

HEDRA

He can't hear you.

HEDRA (voice over)

Wait till you see me.

HEDRA

Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking

like you any more, can I ?

HEDRA

Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.

HEDRA

Ta-dah !

HEDRA

How's that ? Good ?

HEDRA

22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay

cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate

to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All

right.

HEDRA

So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too.

Okay ? Be good. Bye.

CASHIER GIRL (voice over)

What's the part this time ?

HEDRA

Excuse me ?

CASHIER GIRL

You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person

twice.

CASHIER GIRL

I like it. I just thought the other was more you.

HEDRA

Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde.

CASHIER GIRL

Really ? I'm flattered. Thanks.

BANK CLERK

Miss Besch ?

HEDRA

Yes ?

BANK CLERK

A man's been calling here. Says he's your father.

BANK CLERK (voice over)

Might even come to New York if you don't call him.

Miss Besch !

BUILDING MANAGER

Hey !

ALLISON

Mmmm !

THE PEDESTRIAN GIRL

Jerk !

HEDRA

Oh !

BUILDING MANAGER

You live here ?

HEDRA

No, no, I'm just watching the place for the week-end like

that. It's on a timer. Huh... Huh... I'm sorry.

BUILDING MANAGER

I have to register a complaint.

HEDRA

Please, I'll turn it off. I will.

HEDRA

How could you do that ? Everything I've done, I've done for

you. Don't you understand that ? People you hated, I hated.

HEDRA

People like you don't care.

HEDRA

Just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents,

too. Told them all my secrets.

HEDRA

You want to put me away, huh ?

HEDRA

I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I

can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't...

HEDRA

Oh God !... Oh God !... Ohhh !

HEDRA

What ?... What ?

ALLISON

Please...

HEDRA

No.

ALLISON (whispering)

Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

ALLISON

Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay.

ALLISON (voice over)

We've got to get out of here now.

BARBARA

Jesus...

What ?

BARBARA (voice over from the main hall)

Get in here.

MITCHELL

What ?

What is it ? What?

BARBARA

Look.

BARBARA

It's erasing.

BARBARA

I didn't do anything.

Bitch !

HEDRA (voice over)

Should I just plug this in the phone jack ?

ALLISON (voice over)

Huh-huh.

ALLISON

Great.

HEDRA

Can you make reservations on this ?

ALLISON

Hm-m. And you can pay by credit card.

ALLISON

L.A., right ?

HEDRA

Yeah.

BARBARA (voice over)

No answer at the first number.

MITCHELL (voice over)

What about this number ?

MITCHELL

Busy.

MITCHELL

You turn them off.

(yelling)

Turn them all off !

HEDRA

Things are going to be different in L.A, Allie. You'll see.

ALLISON

First class ?

HEDRA

Is it worth it ?

ALLISON

Well, we can use one of Graham's cards. I think I saw his

wallet in the living room.

HEDRA

Oh... Me too. Okay, I'll go and see.

PLEASE HELP ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

HEDRA (voice over from the living room)

I can't find it.

ALLISON

I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen.

I'M AT 768 W.74TH STREET, APT.

ALLISON

No ! No ! No ! No !

HEDRA

Going down.

MITCHELL

Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at

home ?

HEDRA

No, he's on a cruise.

MITCHELL

Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you

know her ?

HEDRA

Who are you ?

MITCHELL

Mitchell Myerson.

MITCHELL

She did a job for me.

HEDRA

Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor.

MITCHELL

Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I

did contact her here once.

HEDRA

Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So...

You'll excuse me.

MITCHELL

Oh, sorry.

MITCHELL

This is hers. You do know her.

MITCHELL (voice over)

What the fuck is going on here ?

ALLISON

Be careful, she's crazy.

HEDRA

Get off of her.

MITCHELL

What ?

HEDRA

You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off

her !

MITCHELL

Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay.

ALLISON

Where is she ?

MITCHELL

Don't worry about her, I took care of her.

HEDRA

I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...

HEDRA

I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I

don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any

more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a

reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there

isn't one.

HEDRA

You don't want to say anything special to anyone ?

HEDRA

Okay, Allison Jones, go on.

HEDRA

Now they'll know it was you.

ALLISON

No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was

never that scared. Well... not like that.

HEDRA

Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being

alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care.

HEDRA

Did you know that identical twins are never really

identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one

who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left

me. Just like you.

HEDRA

Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way.

ALLISON

Okay.

HEDRA

Allie !

HEDRA

Please...

HEDRA

Please...

ALLISON

I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not any more. I'm like you

now.

ALLISON (voice over)

Graham !

HEDRA

I'll kill you !

ALLISON

Get off him !

ALLISON

Graham, stay inside !

GRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment)

All right.

HEDRA

No... No... No...

HEDRA

No... No... No...

HEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison)

Huh... Huh...

HEDRA

Allie ?

HEDRA (yelling)

Allie ?

HEDRA

Hey, here you are.

HEDRA

Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come

on... Allie !...

HEDRA (voice over)

Come on !

HEDRA (screaming)

Come out now !

HEDRA (voice over)

Allie, please.

HEDRA

I'm scared ! Where are you ?

HEDRA (voice over)

Allie...

HEDRA

Why are you hiding from me ?

HEDRA

You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is

sticking out of it.

HEDRA

Allie...

ALLISON (voice over)

I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.

ALLISON (voice over)

Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to

start letting go. He's right.

ALLISON (voice over)

Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain

her that her sister's death wasn't her fault.

ALLISON (voice over)

But she never forgave herself for surviving.

ALLISON (voice over)

So every day, I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.

ALLISON (voice over)

Then I try to do what she couldn't... Forgive myself.

ALLISON (voice over)

I know what can happen to someone who doesn't.
