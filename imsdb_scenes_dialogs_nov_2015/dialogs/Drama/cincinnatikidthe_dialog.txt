SHOOTING DRAFT - 1965

DEALER

Somebody shut the goddam window. Let

a man think.

DEALER

Possible straight gets a --

(deals the card)

-- lovely little four.

FIRST PLAYER

On the last hand even, you couldn't

give me a break.

DEALER

I put the brakes on your straight,

didn't I?

(he laughs; no one

else does; he deals

to The Kid)

There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.

KID

Thanks.

DEALER

(deals to Danny)

And our lucky friend from Chicago

gets a queen with his pair of sixes.

Little lady make you happy, Buster?

DANNY

Deal to yourself, clown.

DEALER

Dealer gives himself a --

(deals card and groans)

I might have known.

(to Danny)

Bet your sixes, Buster.

DANNY

I told you not to call me that.

(then as the dealer

turns away)

Cost you --

(counts out his money)

Ninety-four bucks.

DEALER

Biggest pot of the whole game, I got

to drop.

DANNY

(to First Player)

Interested?

FIRST PLAYER

Wouldn't call you if I had a pair

higher'n sixes. Which I ain't.

KID

Don't seem like he'd bet out without

something better than the sixes,

does it?

(fingers hole card as

if to fold)

Cost me every cent I've won since

yesterday afternoon.

(studies Danny's face)

But I tell you, I got this stubborn

streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.

DANNY

(indignantly)

You can't have better than a pair of

kings!

KID

Oh, I'm not claiming anything that

fine.

(turns over an eight,

making a pair of

them)

Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.

DANNY

You seen my hole card, you bastard!

(indicating Dealer)

He was dealing them high.

DANNY

You stole that dough.

KID

You better watch those loose lips of

yours, you want to have any teeth

left behind them -- Buster.

DANNY

You wouldn't of shelled out ninety-

four bucks --

KID

I called you on account of I didn't

think you had another pair or another

six and I know a punk like you would

get greedy and try and buy the last

hand.

KID

Drop it.

HACKIE

What you looking for, mister?

LANCEY

Do I have to be looking for something?

HACKIE

I can pretty much tell.

LANCEY

You can pretty much tell what?

HACKIE

Some guys come to town, I can tell

if they're looking for something.

LANCEY

What do you think I'm looking for?

HACKIE

If you're looking for girls, I can

fix you up.

LANCEY

I strongly doubt if you could fix me

up. In that department.

HACKIE

Well what are you looking for?

LANCEY

You're looking for a clout in the

head if you don't keep your face to

the road.

SECOND HACKIE

Hey, you know who that is?

HACKIE

No. Who?

SECOND HACKIE

(into phone)

Shorty? Want to hear who just checked

into the Park Sherman... Yes, you

do. Lancey Hodges.

ATTENDANT

The Kid know?

BARTENDER

Somebody sure as hell ought to tell

The Kid.

(hangs up)

Lancey Hodges is in town.

FIRST DRINKING MAN

Kid's been laying for him a long

time.

BARBER

You ask me, The Kid'll go after him

as soon as he hears.

CUSTOMER

Who's got a better right?

HOBAN

You going to tell The Kid, Shooter?

SHOOTER

Hell, I can't not tell him.

HOBAN

It's where he's been headed for years.

KID

(in greeting)

Hey!

HOBAN

What you say, Kid?

KID

Hey, Hoban.

SHOOTER

Where you been? Boys been holding a

chair for you in back.

KID

Business opportunity come along.

Something too good to pass up.

SHOOTER

Turn a profit?

KID

Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had

it took back.

HOBAN

Oh, one of those.

SHOOTER

(concerned)

You been in too many rough ones

lately, Kid. You can't go on forever,

coming out in one piece.

KID

I got to build my stake, Aren't enough

chances in this town to let one go.

HOBAN

You're too good, that's your trouble.

People who know you're the Cincinnati

Kid, they don't want to sit down

with you --

KID

For nickels and dimes... Thing is

I've about used up St. Louis.

SHOOTER

(nodding)

The streets are getting full of guys

you've hustled.

KID

Been thinking about Miami. There's

nothing to keep me here.

SHOOTER

(after a moment)

The hell there isn't

(as the Kid looks at

him)

Lancey Hodges' in town.

KID

Yeah?

(then)

The Man himself, here in St. Louis --

I might just stick around Shooter.

LANCEY

(into phone)

Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your

enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite

convenient... I generally prefer

stud but you name it... Your stakes

are my pleasure, sir... Thank you,

why don't we make it after lunch? My

diet these days is enough to spoil

anyone else's appetite... A pleasure,

sir. Please remember me to your

charming wife.

SHOOTER

(lighting a cigar)

I been seeing it coming for a long

time, Kid. Long time.

KID

I ain't exactly been hiding it.

SHOOTER

No, you ain't been hiding it.

KID

Well I got to know.

SHOOTER

Sure, you got to know. We all got to

know.

KID

Sometime or other we got to find out

how much juice we got.

SHOOTER

That's why I had to tell you.

KID

You ever sit down with him?

SHOOTER

Yes, I have.

KID

Well, what happened?

SHOOTER

Nothing. Nothing at all.

KID

You lost.

SHOOTER

I didn't lose. I'm too good to lose

when I set my mind to it. I play

poker a certain way, Kid. I've had

my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it

was Whistling Sam Magee to New

Orleans.

KID

(respectfully)

I heard about him.

SHOOTER

Well then you know it all... about

20 years ago it was, maybe more.

KID

What happened?

SHOOTER

Why, I lost it. It dried me up on

the inside for a long, a very long

time.

KID

Yeah?

SHOOTER

I been where I'm going, know what I

mean?

KID

You think I'm ready?

SHOOTER

(after some time,

several seconds of

thoughtful puffing)

Kid, I don't think you're ready.

KID

(quickly)

Oh.

SHOOTER

But you're not going to take my word

for it, are you? Are you now?

KID

No, I ain't. I can't.

SHOOTER

I know, I know. You got to find out

for yourself.

KID

I don't figure to take him right

away. But if I can hang in there

long enough, I can outlast him. If I

can outlast him, I got a chance. You

admit that, don't you, that I got a

chance?

SHOOTER

I already said I didn't think you

were ready.

KID

Did you think you were ready when

you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee?

SHOOTER

Kid, I thought I was the best stud

poker player in the world. I'm telling

you now, I thought I was the best.

KID

Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky

square with a fair hand with cards.

I got something.

SHOOTER

No, you ain't no cocky square. And

you probably got something.

KID

Okay. And I ain't saying that you

was either when you sat down with

Whistling Sam Magee.

SHOOTER

If you got the stuff, being a little

cocky don't hurt you none.

KID

Well, would you say if I got any

chance at all?

SHOOTER

This much of a chance. If Lancey is

not right. If he's got a cold, or

his stomach ulcer is acting up, or

something like that.

KID

But then everybody'd see he wasn't

right and it wouldn't prove nothing.

Listen, we got to have it understood.

If he's not right, we call it off

till he is.

SHOOTER

You're set on a real showdown, aren't

you? Your mind's all made up.

KID

I got to. You said yourself I got

to. I'm overdue.

SHOOTER

Yeah, you been around a long time --

I was a lot younger than you when I

went up against Whistling Sam -- But

you'd be kinda young too, to be The

Man.

KID

I gotta find out.

SHOOTER

(after a pause)

Want me to set it up?

KID

(gratefully)

I wish you would, Shooter Man.

SHOOTER

All right.

KID

Hey, what if he turns me down?

SHOOTER

He won't, the way I'll spread the

word. He'll have to take you on,

someone in your class. If he ducked

it, that'd make you The Man.

KID

You think he knows I'm around?

SHOOTER

He can smell meat like you a mile

and a half up the river. He knows

you're around and he'll sit down

with you. You want to butt heads

with The Man, I'll set it up.

SHOOTER

There's your woman.

KID

I wouldn't want to wait around too

long. I want to get in and get it

over with.

SHOOTER

He must of come to St. Louis for a

big money game. I'll probably get

asked do I want to deal it for them.

And however long that takes, he'll

have to rest up for you.

KID

Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar,

I can understand that. Sure.

SHOOTER

You got much of a stake?

KID

Close to three grand.

SHOOTER

Work on it. But three grand will

give you a ride and even if you don't

win, why you'll come away with a

good idea of what you're made of.

But once you go in Kid you can't

quit. You get that straight right

now. Two of you go in and only one

of you can come out.

KID

Well, school's out. I damn sure don't

want no lessons. I want everything

he's got.

SHOOTER

It's the only way to be, Kid.

SHOOTER

See you.

CHRISTIAN

When we leaving town, Kid? This week?

KID

No, I won't be ready. Not for a while.

CHRISTIAN

I thought --

KID

Might even turn out we don't go.

CHRISTIAN

You must feel different about it

than you did Saturday.

KID

Yeah, I'm feeling a little different.

(TIME LAPSE)

KID

It's all right. You don't have to

act like a cat. You're not bothering

me.

CHRISTIAN

You want me to turn out the light?

KID

No. I'm overtired, that's why I can't

sleep.

(sits up and swings

his feet to the floor)

Why can't you sleep?

CHRISTIAN

(lightly)

Undertired, I guess. If a person

rests all day, she doesn't have much

to rest up from at night.

(stands up)

Why don't you have a nice hot bath?

I could give you a rubdown and then

you could have a nice hot bath, and

then maybe you could sleep.

KID

'Kay. Can't hurt to try it.

KID

What did you do with yourself this

time?

CHRISTIAN

Last night I went to a movie with

The Shooter's woman. French movie.

KID

In French?

CHRISTIAN

They had the words in English at the

bottom of the picture. But The

Shooter's woman knew what they were

saying without it. Pig's woman or

somebody told me she went to college.

KID

Sure. Majored in man-eating.

CHRISTIAN

I think maybe she really did go. But

I never quite dared to up and ask

her.

KID

I didn't know you ran with The

Shooter's woman.

CHRISTIAN

We got to be kind of friendly when

you both were in that three-day game

down to Cairo. 'Course she's older'n

me.

KID

And been around more. A lot more.

What was the movie like?

CHRISTIAN

Weird. It wasn't a straight story

where you knew whose side you were

on, the way you do in regular

pictures.

KID

American pictures.

CHRISTIAN

Yeah. There were lots of things I

didn't understand.

KID

What was it about?

CHRISTIAN

Well, there's this town in Europe a

long time ago where they get a message

from a Spanish general he's coming

to spend the night with his troops.

So all the men are scared silly about

what the soldiers will do to them.

KID

Nothing weird about that.

CHRISTIAN

But all the wives and daughters tell

the men to go hide somewhere and let

them bargain with the enemy.

KID

That don't make much sense.

CHRISTIAN

Wait. The way they handle it is they

go to bed with the Spaniards. And

the next morning the soldiers go off

peacefully and everybody's happy.

KID

Including the husbands and fathers?

Don't they suspect?

CHRISTIAN

That's part of what I wasn't sure

of. I guess they know what went on

but they care more about their safety

and their money than they do about

their honor.

KID

Then they got their heads screwed on

straight. Honor's just an idea. You

can't see or feel it and you can't

eat it and you sure as hell can't

get any mileage on it.

CHRISTIAN

I'll just turn off the bath water.

MELBA

(into phone)

Hello... Yes, it is. You want him?

(calling)

Shooter! Telephone! Shooter!

MELBA

Phone for you. I always seem to be

the one to answer it, no matter who

it's for.

SHOOTER

(getting up)

If you'd rather we put it in my room --

MELBA

Are you kidding?

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Hello?... Well, hello. What brings

you to our fair city? Little action,

maybe?

LANCEY

(into phone)

How could you guess, Shooter? I was

invited by a Mr. William Schlaegel --

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery.

Braumeister beer.

LANCEY

(into phone)

As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt,

we don't want everyone to have to

watch everyone else dealing to see

to it they don't make any little

accidental errors by mistake. I told

him a man couldn't ask for a better

guarantee of a fair-and-square game

than having The Shooter deal it. So

if you're willing, we're meeting at

two o'clock in the afternoon. Ask

for Mr. Schlaegel's suite at the

Park Sherman... Good. I'm glad you

can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to

see you again...

(then)

Oh pretty much the same... Just have

to be a little careful about smoking

and drinking and eating -- and

breathing. See you tomorrow. Good

night.

CHRISTIAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Would you wear it in public?

MELBA

Wouldn't be much point wearing it in

private. Sure, why not, as long as

you don't have a bulge to hide?

CHRISTIAN

I don't know, Melba.

MELBA

(looking her over)

My guess is there isn't anything

about you needs hiding. But I'll

give you a more definitive opinion

at the bath.

CHRISTIAN

(startled)

At the what?

MELBA

Turkish Bath. After we're through

shopping. I'm treating you, Christian.

CHRISTIAN

I never been. I'm not even sure what

you do.

MELBA

You don't do anything. That's what's

so marvelous. They do it to you.

CHRISTIAN

The third time I stayed. Never went

back to the boarding house except to

pick up my things.

MELBA

And that side of it's held up? No

complaints in the bed department?

CHRISTIAN

Well, just one.

MELBA

(intrigued)

Yes?

CHRISTIAN

The nights he isn't there.

MELBA

He really does that to you, does he?

You got one of the rare ones.

CHRISTIAN

You find a guy, you love him, and

that's it. It's supposed to just go

on like that for life. Right?

MELBA

According to the propaganda, right.

CHRISTIAN

But it isn't my life, it's his life,

with me tacked on. You have any idea

what it's like to be a hash slinger

in a cheap restaurant?

MELBA

No, honey, the stock crash wafted me

right from the daisy chain into

unmarried bliss.

CHRISTIAN

It's hell, if you'll excuse the word.

But I didn't want to quit. The Kid

made me. I felt I ought to hang on

to something that was me away from

him. You know what I mean?

MELBA

Sure. Some girls solve the problem

by taking on an extra guy.

CHRISTIAN

I'm serious. Having children might

take care of it, I don't know. Or --

this is really a terrible thing to

admit.

MELBA

Your most sordid secrets are safe

with me. Confess.

CHRISTIAN

If he was rich, or famous --

MELBA

Why don't you give him both?

CHRISTIAN

(smiling)

Why not? Well, if he was rich and

famous, maybe I wouldn't mind so

much just being -- just a woman to

him. Do you think that might make it

seem more worthwhile somehow?

MELBA

Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie?

(reacting to the

masseur's touch)

Oooo -- divine.

(to Christian)

Isn't this heaven?

CHRISTIAN

I'm not sure. In a way it seems soft

of --

MELBA

Decadent? Depraved?

MELBA

Wicked?

CHRISTIAN

Well, yes.

MELBA

That's what I meant by heaven.

SHOOTER

(as he deals)

Still queens -- possible flush -- no

help -- possible flush.

FIRST WEALTHY TYPE

Queens check to the possibles.

LANCEY

Check.

SECOND WEALTHY TYPE

Check.

FIRST WEALTHY TYPE

Fold.

LANCEY

And up two.

SECOND WEALTHY TYPE

Fold.

THIRD WEALTHY TYPE

Biggest pot yet.

BILL

Call the two thou.

LANCEY

(turning over queen

of his suit)

Queen high.

BILL

(indignantly)

Jack high. Can you beat that?

FIRST WEALTHY TYPE

He just did.

THIRD WEALTHY TYPE

(to Second Wealthy

Type)

It's your office.

SECOND WEALTHY TYPE

Dallas or Tulsa?

THIRD WEALTHY TYPE

She just said office.

BILL

How the bloody hell did you figure

out I didn't have the king or the

ace?

LANCEY

I recollect a young fellow putting

the same question to Eddie the Dude.

It was a game in the grand lounge of

the "J.M. White, Third," the largest

paddle-wheeler ever built. "Son,"

Eddie told him, "All you paid was

the looking price. Lessons are extra."

(turns to Shooter)

First time I heard of this Cincinnati

Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller's.

I knew right away I'd have to play

him someday.

SHOOTER

You'll enjoy his game.

LANCEY

I may admire it. But if he's all

that good, I doubt if I'll enjoy it.

SHOOTER

The tougher the competition, the

better you used to like it.

LANCEY

I've learned to take everything in

moderation.

KID

(to Melba)

Have a drink with us?

MELBA

Better not. Shooter said they'd break

at seven, and he has to have his

food first, then his nap.

(looking The Kid over)

You know, there's a day in your life

I'm looking forward to.

KID

In my life?

MELBA

The day The Kid becomes The Man.

CHRISTIAN

How'd you sleep Kid?

KID

I slept okay.

CHRISTIAN

I hope you don't mind my not being

there when you woke up.

KID

No I don't mind --

(then)

What she was talking about, Shooter's

woman -- I'm going up against a big

game soon.

CHRISTIAN

She told me. It's a very big game, I

hear.

KID

Yes.

CHRISTIAN

Will it be long?

KID

Why?

(then)

What's the matter?

CHRISTIAN

I thought --

KID

Thought what?

CHRISTIAN

I'd go home and see Mama.

KID

I wouldn't be able to spare you much

change.

CHRISTIAN

Oh, I wouldn't want much. Bus is

really the best way to go.

KID

Would a hundred fish do it? For the

bus and something nice to bring your

Mama?

CHRISTIAN

That would be fine, Kid. Just fine.

KID

When would you want to go?

CHRISTIAN

There's no reason for not going right

now unless --

KID

Unless what?

CHRISTIAN

Unless you wanted to go to bed first.

KID

Do you want to? Would you like it?

CHRISTIAN

Un-huh. I'd like it.

KID

You want dessert?

CHRISTIAN

No. You?

KID

(shakes head)

Coffee?

CHRISTIAN

I don't need it.

KID

Neither do I.

KID

You still haven't said it.

CHRISTIAN

Said what?

KID

If you're coming back.

CHRISTIAN

Maybe I ought to stay with Mama and

Papa a while, and see.

KID

What's to see?

CHRISTIAN

I never did like city streets.

KID

Oh.

CHRISTIAN

Uh-huh. The promise didn't fulfill

itself for me.

KID

Promise?

CHRISTIAN

Come to the city and all. Electric

lights and flush toilets. All the

pretty dreams -- it was all promise.

KID

Oh, I see.

CHRISTIAN

I don't know if you do or not Kid --

You're city -- and I'm country --

You grew up with it.

KID

I don't think that's why you're going --

because you like it so much better

in the country.

CHRISTIAN

What will you do?

KID

Well, I've got that big game.

CHRISTIAN

I heard he's The Man for you.

KID

Yes. If I won, there would be a lot

of money.

CHRISTIAN

You'll win. You been coming on strong

a long way. This is your time.

(then after a long

moment)

Come home with me to Mama's Kid.

KID

(finally)

I'm sorry.

CHRISTIAN

(gently)

I know you are honey -- I know it.

KID

I'll go down to the bus with you.

CHRISTIAN

You don't have to.

KID

(starting to dress)

I'll go down with you.

CHRISTIAN

(after a pause)

Kid --

KID

Yeah?

CHRISTIAN

This is going to sound kind of funny

to you, but I want to ask it.

KID

Sure.

CHRISTIAN

Do you think there's any chance, if

you do win this big game, that you

might do something else besides cards?

(hastily)

I don't mean never play poker. I

just mean not have it be the only

thing you do.

KID

Hell, it's the only thing I know how

to do. What else is there for a guy

never finished school? College

graduates are walking the streets

looking for jobs -- trained people,

engineers, scientists!

CHRISTIAN

I realize --

KID

(not letting her speak)

When you're The Man, you don't have

to hustle -- When you're The Man,

The Best, the Big Money comes around

on their knees just beggin' to hustle

you. I'm not goin' to quit. I'm goin'

to win.

CHRISTIAN

Yes, I can see that. Of course I

didn't say quit.

KID

Well you see how it is.

CHRISTIAN

That's all right.

KID

(after a moment)

Christian, you aren't doing this to

be off my back, in case I lose?

CHRISTIAN

I been thinking about it a long time.

I been planning to go home and see

how I felt about things.

KID

And this just helped you decide.

CHRISTIAN

That's all.

KID

Then don't go.

CHRISTIAN

(firmly)

No, this is your time -- Now you go

on Honey and you play The Man --

I'll be at Mama's.

KID

I wish it could be more.

CHRISTIAN

That's all right.

CHRISTIAN

I don't guess I'll ever forget these

rooms, Kid.

KID

I don't guess I will either.

CHRISTIAN

You going to move?

KID

If I win, it won't be good enough.

If I lose, I lose it all.

CHRISTIAN

Goodbye, Kid. Good luck.

KID

Goodbye, Christian.

BILL

Four stacks? Right, Schooter?

SHOOTER

Four.

BILL

Thank you for the entertainment,

gentlemen. My particular gratitude

to you, Lancey. It's been a rare

pleasure to watch a great artist at

work. Thank you for the privilege.

LANCEY

Well now, son, you're quite welcome.

Can't say I recall another man, in

all my days on the three rivers, who

seemed to find it quite so pleasurable

losing all that money.

BILL

Good day, gentlemen. You're welcome

to use the premises as long as you

like.

BILL

I want to see you.

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Hi, Kid. Shooter here. Listen, I

told the woman I'd take her to the

ball park, but I'm still working.

How about you and Christian take her

out?

KID

(into phone)

Christian's gone home to see her

folks.

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Oh.

(then)

Well listen, would you mind taking

her yourself? The gang'll be there,

in the section... Thanks. Appreciate

it. See you.

SOKAL

(to Hoban)

You owe me two fish on the out, plus

three on the inning, minus two on no

strikeouts so far.

HOBAN

Hiya, Kid. Getting yourself in shape

for The Man?

(to Melba)

Shooter still on the job?

HOBAN'S WOMAN

Where's Christian?

MELBA

(in a whisper)

Lay off that.

PIG

What'd she do, take off? So did mine.

Don't lose no sweat, Kid, there's

plenty more where they came from.

All shapes and sizes.

KID

Hi, Hoban. Sokal. Pig.

HOBAN

(to Sokal)

Boyer. One to two on the sacrifice.

SOKAL

Five to three, I'll give you. Two-

fifty against one-fifty.

HOBAN

Mark it.

SOKAL

I figure they'll walk him. Fill up

first.

KID

Not with who's coming up. I'll take

the same odds.

MELBA

Get some of this sun.

SOKAL

(to The Kid)

Mark it.

KID

(to Melba)

Guess I will.

HOBAN

Bunting, Sokal.

SOKAL

So they pitched to him. I still win.

PIG

(to Kid)

Everybody been on the phone to

everybody about coming to watch you

and Lancey. Big Spriigi, Yeller to

N'Orleans, Old Lady Fingers. They're

all coming.

MELBA

(to Kid)

Let me give you some of this. Keep

you from burning.

KID

I don't think --

MELBA

Can't hurt you.

HOBAN

(to Sokal)

Chance to invest your profits. Bet

you an even fin he make first.

SOKAL

(looking toward plate)

Who we got -- Warwick? You got

yourself a bet, pal.

SOKAL'S VOICE

Not your day, Hoban.

(calling to a vendor)

Hey, beer!

MELBA

(softly)

Mais tu es charmant --

CUT TO:

MELBA

Charmant. Come here, please.

KID

Any special reason?

MELBA

Me. I'm special.

KID

Sure you are. You're The Shooter's

woman.

MELBA

Right. And maybe I'll go on being

The Shooter's Woman, even after you

and I have had our little romp. What

do you think about that?

KID

First place, Old Shooter'll come

barging through that door any minute.

He said they were winding it up.

MELBA

No barging. He doesn't have his key

with him.

(stands up)

Have to buzz from downstairs.

(moves toward him

provocatively)

So we can treat ourselves to a little

sample of things to come.

KID

Also it don't mean anything to you,

you're Christian's friend?

MELBA

Honey, she lost her franchise the

minute she got on that bus. You know

that.

(her arms around him)

I have a shaky sense of security,

Kid. Don't make me feel unwanted.

MELBA

No good?

KID

You know damn well how good it was.

Where's a pack of cards?

MELBA

What do we need cards for?

KID

Gin or casino, you name it. All I

know is we're switching to another

indoor sport.

SHOOTER

Lady Fingers'll want to come, I bet,

and she's right on the edge of her

stake. She could spell me dealing.

LANCEY

Sure, sure. Haven't seen the dear

old bitch in fifteen years.

SHOOTER

Well, that's it, then. Monday night,

Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel.

And may the best man win.

LANCEY

Yes, that's how it usually comes out

in the long run. You think this boy

is going to give me trouble, Shooter?

SHOOTER

Yeah, he's going to give you trouble.

LANCEY

I don't want it to be one of those

marathon games. Not any more.

SHOOTER

Like the session with The Portugee

at Jolly's in Omaha. Remember?

LANCEY

Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played

though, I was a kid on my way to the

Klondike gold rush. At Soapy Smith's

in Skagway. Four nights and three

days.

SHOOTER

You win?

LANCEY

Depends how you look at it. When we

wound up, the Yukon River had frozen

over and you couldn't get through to

Dawson City till the following June.

Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks

and missed the gold rush.

SHOOTER

You been around a long time.

LANCEY

That is undeniably true. But it

doesn't mean I'm ready to retire.

How old is this boy of yours?

SHOOTER

Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something

like that.

LANCEY

Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot

better, knowing that. I was thirty-

six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude.

This Kid of yours is just going to

have to wait a few years.

FELIX

Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr.

Schlaegel asked me to remind you how

eager he was to see you.

SHOOTER

I ought to call my woman.

FELIX

Yes, of course. They always like to

know it if you're going to be late

for supper.

MELBA

Still building eights.

KID

Thanks for putting it together for

me.

MELBA

It's not my game.

MELBA

Want to know what is?

MELBA

(into phone)

Hello -- Oh, hi, sugar -- why not?

MELBA

(into phone)

What's the switch?

MELBA

(into phone)

Whose idea was that?

MELBA

(to Kid)

He's not coming home now.

MELBA

(into phone)

Whatever you say, Shooter man.

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Explain to The Kid, will you?

MELBA

(into phone)

He'll understand.

SHOOTER

(into phone)

Tell him they decided to play a little

longer, and I'll call him at his

place later when the game's over...

Right. Goodbye, honey.

KID

Listen, Melba --

MELBA

I have to tell you first. You're

sitting down with Lancey next Monday

night.

KID

I wish it was sooner. I wish it was

tomorrow.

MELBA

Shooter'll give you all the details

later.

KID

I don't like waiting that long.

MELBA

Let's not kick a gift horse in the

teeth, sugar. We've got this time

together. Let's try to "fill each

unforgiving minute with sixty seconds

worth of distance run."

KID

Listen, what I was going to say

before, I don't want you to think

I'm being some kind of jerk or I

don't feel you'd be great to sack up

with.

MELBA

Then let's cut the filibuster.

KID

I've made dolls that were friends of

mine's wives. I figured if they were

willing, they were doing it to their

husbands, I wasn't.

MELBA

Of course. Any other attitude, you're

degrading the woman. You're not

treating her as a person with a mind

of her own, but as somebody's

property.

KID

Only thing is, it's different with

The Shooter than anybody else. He's

so straight, I got the obligation to

be straighter with him than other

people. So do you. On account of we

both owe him plenty.

MELBA

I thought we just agreed that what

you and I did was strictly between

us.

KID

Can't be.

(decisively, pulling

away from her with a

pat of dismissal)

Shooter's the closest thing to family

I got. It's almost like he was my

old man. Don't you see how that's

got a bearing on us?

MELBA

Sure, it means I'm your mother.

BILL

Shooter -- very generous of you to

come on such short notice. Rosanna

you know, and I think you've met my

daughter June.

(indicating baby)

No point introducing you to William

the Fourth. He has a bad memory for

names.

SHOOTER

(greeting them in

turn)

Mrs. Schlaegel. How are you, June.

What's it all about, Bill?

BILL

Little something I'd like to sound

you out on. But the least I can do

is offer you a drink.

ROSANNA

Like me to fix it, love?

BILL

Wonderful. Why don't you do a batch

of your Bloody Marys? If that's okay

with you, Shooter?

SHOOTER

Great. Whatever.

ROSANNA

Just don't let it get wet again.

BILL

I've been quite busy on the telephone

since I last saw you. There's a lot

of interest all over the country in

this game with Lancey and The Kid.

SHOOTER

Betting interest?

BILL

Jack Doyle in New York is giving

twelve to five on Lancey. Same odds

in Reno. I've taken fifty thousand

of it so far.

SHOOTER

Fifty thousand!

BILL

I'll probably go for more but I didn't

want to rock the odds.

SHOOTER

I knew you liked The Kid's style but

why you going in so deep?

BILL

Two reasons. First, I want to see

that smug old bastard gutted worse

than he gutted me. Second, as long

as that's going to happen, I don't

see why I shouldn't make some money

out of it.

SHOOTER

But how can you be so sure? The Kid

could do it, we both know that, but --

BILL

"Could" isn't good enough for a man

who hates to lose money as much as I

do. He's going to need help -- from

the best man with a pack of cards

between Omaha and New Orleans.

SHOOTER

Not a chance, Bill. You ought to

know I never ever use what I got

with the cards for nothing but tricks

and dressing up a game.

BILL

Sure, I know it. That's why you're

the man they choose to give them a

square deal. That's what makes it so

perfect. Nobody'll be looking for

it.

SHOOTER

It's out. Out.

BILL

The great thing is they'll be so

close, The Kid won't need much. Three

or four key hands.

SHOOTER

Understand this, Bill. I'd like for

The Kid to win, and I sure as hell

don't want to see you lose all that

money --

BILL

If I did, I'd have to collect that

twelve grand you owe me. Not myself.

My collection agents. You knew poor

Wildwood Jones, didn't you?

SHOOTER

OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin'

in ain't it? Six grand already.

(then as Bill just

looks at him)

Bill, you got to listen to me --!

BILL

No, I don't. It's quite the other

way around. You have some delusion

you're a free agent, but you're not.

I own you.

SHOOTER

For God's sake --!

BILL

Shut up. I'll cross the twelve off

the books and give you ten thousand

dollars in cash. And you can tell

The Kid if he needs more of a stake,

I'll put it up.

(looks o.s. and smiles)

Marvelous. Here's Rosanna with what

you need.

BILL

-- for that dry feeling on the roof

of your mouth.

(TIME LAPSE)

BOY

Shine them up for you sir?

KID

No, thanks.

BOY

Fetch you a newspaper maybe?

KID

No.

BOY

How about a singy-song then? I play

good.

KID

Play what?

BOY

Dry corn in this one. Blue shale

stone from the river in this one.

You ready?

KID

Yes, I'm ready.

BOY

(to bartender)

You ready?

BARTENDER

Hell, I'm ready for anything.

KID

(when the song is

over)

Thank you very much. That was nice.

Where did you learn to do that?

BOY

I picked it up from Herman.

KID

Who is Herman?

BOY

My friend I pick it up from.

KID

Is he a good friend?

BOY

I don't know 'bout that suh. He just

a frien' who teach me some things.

KID

Well, I don't want a shine, but here's

fifteen cents.

BOY

Thank you, sir.

BARTENDER

And here's another dime for you,

fella.

BARTENDER

Nice little colored kid.

KID

(mostly to himself)

-- Yeah.

JANSEN

Monday night, uh, Kid?

KID

Monday night.

JANSEN

I sprung for some of the action. A

yard and a half of that five-to-two.

KID

Thanks, Jansen.

(in pain)

Hey!

JANSEN

We got to get you loosened up. I

never felt you this tight.

KID

(into phone)

Just tell The Shooter I'll be there

on the dot Monday night.

MELBA'S VOICE

(over the phone)

And until then?

KID

He doesn't have to know.

MELBA

(into phone)

I'm not asking for him.

CHRISTIAN

Hello, Kid.

KID

Can I help you with those?

CHRISTIAN

Taking if off is harder than taking

it on in.

CHRISTIAN

How's The Shooter?

KID

Fine.

CHRISTIAN

You haven't played yet?

KID

Monday.

CHRISTIAN

This is Eric, Mama. He's come to see

me.

MRS. CRAIGIE

How do, Eric.

CHRISTIAN

We lost suction on the pump right in

the middle of canning.

MRS. CRAIGIE

There's coffee. And sour ham and

bread in the warmer, if you're hungry

Eric.

MRS. CRAIGIE

You know anything about canning, you

know we can't stop now. If we'd been

looking for company, we never would

have started.

CHRISTIAN

Spring beans, you have to cook them

fast. But you find yourself some

breakfast.

KID

I'm all right. Bus stopped for

doughnuts and coffee.

CHRISTIAN

You can stay with us tonight and

still make it back to St. Lou on the

Sunday schedule by about midnight. I

told Mama and Papa about The Man.

And all.

KID

Where is Mr. Craigie?

MRS. CRAIGIE

To the barn. Why don't you go down

and introduce yourself? Christian

and me'll be at this another hour or

two.

KID

I think I will. I think I'd like

that.

(to Christian)

Okay?

CHRISTIAN

Sure. And I'll see you a little later

on.

(then, as he starts

out)

Papa don't know everything. About

you and me.

CRAIGIE

Hello.

KID

How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I'm Eric

Stoner.

CRAIGIE

Christian's Eric.

KID

That's right.

CRAIGIE

You seen her?

KID

She's helping her mother can.

CRAIGIE

You minding to marry Christian?

KID

You got any objections if I do, or

if I don't?

CRAIGIE

Son, that's what I call a sharp

answer.

KID

It was what I call a sharp question.

CRAIGIE

We don't know much about you,

Christian's mother and me.

KID

I'm what's known as a three-river

man. Which just means I go around

playing stud poker wherever I can

find the kind of action I'm looking

for.

CRAIGIE

You met Christian when she was working

to Hot Springs?

KID

Yeah. I was playing in this game in

the hotel and she was a waitress in

the coffee shop. We went out. I told

her I thought she could get a better

job in St. Louis.

CRAIGIE

Now how did you happen to tell her

that? Maybe you run some kind of

employment service on the side?

KID

I said it because I wanted her in

St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there

and she called me and we been seeing

each other ever since.

CRAIGIE

Living together?

KID

Yeah, living together.

CRAIGIE

How come she come home now? She going

to have a baby?

KID

Not that I know of.

CRAIGIE

You two have a fight?

KID

No.

CRAIGIE

She must have had a reason.

KID

Think so? Well, you've known her

longer than me.

(then)

Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and

Christian find out a few things then

maybe I won't have to answer your

questions.

CRAIGIE

I never run across anybody like you.

I guess I don't understand gamblers.

KID

That's all right. I don't understand

farmers.

CRAIGIE

You say things that sound smart

alecky. But I'm not sure if they

really are smart alecky.

KID

Well I can't take into account what

somebody's going to feel every time

I say something.

CRAIGIE

Are you a believer?

KID

In some things.

CRAIGIE

I mean in God.

KID

That's a tough one. I don't disbelieve

in Him, but I couldn't say I believed

in Him either. I guess I just never

paid Him much mind. Didn't seem

important.

CRAIGIE

God not important?

KID

I don't mean what He does isn't

important -- if He exists. I mean

it's not important to me whether He

exists or not.

CRAIGIE

Christian was raised in a Christian

home.

KID

Is that so? I didn't know ---

(then)

I'm not aware of the difference.

(pause)

I'm not asking permission to marry

Christian, you know.

CRAIGIE

I know.

KID

If I was, the only person I'd be

asking it from is her.

CRAIGIE

(after a moment)

Who is this fella Christian says

you're going to play that's so

important?

KID

He's the king of the stud poker

players.

CRAIGIE

And you're going to play him.

KID

Yes.

CRAIGIE

Are you any good?

KID

I'm this good. The Man has got to

play me.

CRAIGIE

What happens if he don't?

KID

Then I'm The Man.

CRAIGIE

That important to you?

KID

I been trying to figure that out

ever since I set it up.

CRAIGIE

You playing because of money?

KID

(after a moment)

Not really.

CRAIGIE

Christian said you never was much

worried about money -- I been worried

about money most of my life -- up

until I figured out it wasn't so

important.

KID

No, it's necessary, but it isn't so

important.

CRAIGIE

Well how come you want to play this

King fella?

KID

Ambition -- maybe security, like

that.

CRAIGIE

Is it aspiration to be the King or

just uncertainty about the future?

KID

I ain't looking for security if that's

what you mean.

CRAIGIE

Not trying to lock something up tight

and nail it down?

KID

That would figure into it. But that

isn't all of it. -- It's important

to me.

CRAIGIE

Now son which is more important to

you, this king business or Christian?

KID

If you got the guts to ask that

question, Mr. Craigie, I guess I got

the guts to answer it. Christian, if

you came right down to it, is not as

important as doing what I have to

do.

CRAIGIE

Well son, I had to know.

KID

Know what?

CRAIGIE

There never was a man worth a damn,

to my mind, who let his woman stand

in the way of the thing he had to

do.

(then)

I got to go now -- see what I can do

for a sick heifer. Why don't you

take Christian, when her Mama lets

go of her, and tell her I said you

should go to the old spring. It's a

good place.

KID

Thanks. I'll tell her.

CHRISTIAN

It stays warm all winter.

DISSOLVE:

CHRISTIAN

Papa's mama used to bring her wash

up here.

KID

We liable to draw an audience?

CHRISTIAN

Don't worry. It's on our land --

Nobody uses it.

CHRISTIAN

You must have said something to Papa

gave him the picture on us in St.

Lou. Else he never would have spoke

to you about this place.

KID

I told him on account of he already

knew. Never any sense feeding a man

a lie he's not going to believe.

CHRISTIAN

Even if he did know, I'm glad you

told him.

KID

(in mock protest)

Hey, you're all wet!

CHRISTIAN

So are you, foolish.

CRAIGIE

Let me get this straight in my head.

Cards is all a matter of luck, who

gets dealt the best ones.

CRAIGIE

So when one of you professional

gamblers sits down with a bunch of

your -- what do you call them --

customers, clients?

KID

The technical term is "suckers." Or

"marks."

CRAIGIE

Their chance of winning is just as

good as yours, except if you got a

way to control it, who gets what

cards. Right?

KID

Not right. That's cheating and it's

not any part of what we're talking

about.

CRAIGIE

Then how do you win?

KID

I'll show you.

KID

You see one of these cards is white

on both sides, one is red on both

sides, and the other is white on one

side, red on the other.

CRAIGIE

What about it?

KID

This. I put the three cards in a hat

and shake them up, and then I ask

you to draw one card out blind. Put

it face down on the table so neither

of us can see the bottom side.

KID

Okay, red on top. That eliminates

the all-white card, right. So the

card you've picked is one of two --

the all-red or the red-and-white.

One out of two is an even chance, an

even-money proposition. Right -- you

follow me?

CRAIGIE

I think so.

KID

So if I said I'll bet you a dollar

to seventy-five cents the other side

of that card is red, you'd take the

bet wouldn't you?

CRAIGIE

Seems like. Yeah.

KID

And that answer makes you a sucker.

Because the odds are two to one, the

other side of that card is red, and

I ought to be offering you a dollar

to fifty cents instead of seventy-

five.

CRAIGIE

But if there are just the two

possibilities.

KID

There are three possibilities.

(indicating card on

table)

That can be the red side of the red-

and-white card, or it can be either

side of the all-red card. In two

cases out of three the other side is

red. And I'd win the bet from you

two out of every three times we made

it.

CRAIGIE

(dubiously)

You would?

KID

Sure. It's obvious when I explain

it, isn't it?

CRAIGIE

Reckon so. Except if there's only

two things that the bottom side can

be, red or white --

KID

Take my word for it -- the odds are

two to one. And knowing that is the

difference between your gambling man

and your sucker. Not who gets the

better cards but who knows what the

proper odds are. In a poker game

there can be a million different

situations, each with a different

set of odds to figure. The man who

ends up winners is the man who knows

when to bet and how much...

CRAIGIE

The sucker is still took advantage

of, isn't he? The gambler knows

something he don't know.

KID

Sure -- like if you grow better corn

or raise a cow that gives more milk

than the other guy's. Or two business

men are in competition, or two lawyers

are up against each other in a

courtroom. Whatever your line is,

the one who wins out is the one who

knows his job better.

CRAIGIE

Seems like there should be something

else to it --

KID

There is -- Making the man you're

playing against think he's got the

best hand -- and making him pay to

find out.

(TIME LAPSE)

CHRISTIAN

I can't stay long. Papa'll be getting

up to milk.

KID

I'm the one can't stay. I got to

head for that bus.

CHRISTIAN

Why did you come, Kid?

KID

Well, hell, I don't know. I had kind

of a rough time after you left.

CHRISTIAN

Rough how?

KID

Tuesday there was a ball game, but

then the Cardinals went on the road.

I never known time to drag so; I was

all torn apart --

CHRISTIAN

Because of the poker game coming up?

KID

That's how I read it, but I was

reading it wrong. It wasn't Lancey

or the game that was chewing at my

insides --

CHRISTIAN

What else is there could give you

such a bad time?

KID

I finally figured it. I located where

the trouble was. It was you.

CHRISTIAN

Oh, --

KID

When you talk about doing something

besides poker if I get to be The

Man, you don't mean pass up the chance

to make some dough from it for a

while?

CHRISTIAN

I sure don't. I told Papa, wherever

money comes from, it feels the same

when you spend it.

KID

You were going to do some thinking

down here.

CHRISTIAN

I done some.

KID

I'll be back after the game Christian --

You wait here for me and I'll let

you know.

CHRISTIAN

All right Eric -- Good luck Monday.

KID

I got that made now. You said it

right. My time's come.

SHOOTER

Twenty-five years I been building a

reputation.

MELBA

Handle this thing right and your

reputation will be better than ever.

SHOOTER

I made up my mind to this. I ain't

going to give him any help till he

needs it.

MELBA

I'm glad you're taking a stand.

SHOOTER

Hey, what if he starts off lucky and

stays ahead of the game the whole

way. It could happen, you know.

MELBA

You'll make it happen, Baby. I've

got faith in you --

KID

Once more around the square.

LANCEY

It's a friendly town, St. Louis.

I've always said that.

SHOOTER

We ain't seen much of you though,

last seven, eight years.

LANCEY

Climate, Shooter. In my declining

years, I spend more and more time in

Florida and the Gulf Coast.

LADY FINGERS

Lot of folks been figuring another

reason you was keeping clear of the

three rivers.

LANCEY

What reason is that, Lady Fingers?

LADY FINGERS

Cincinnati Kid.

(laughs)

That the way it is, Lancey? You been

scared of The Kid?

LANCEY

Should I be scared of him?

LADY FINGERS

Damn right you should! I'm telling

you, that boy going to make your

stomach ulcer bleed before the night

is out. He's close to murder. I seen

him give a fella the shakes so bad

on a fourth card, it took a pint of

corn liquor to settle him down.

LANCEY

Thanks for the warning.

MELBA

Mow the man down, sugar pie, make it

quick and bloody. Been too many lean

years for all of us.

KID

I intend to take Shooter right along

with Lancey.

MELBA

I'm not talking about the old Shooter.

He's been factory rebuilt. A new

spirit dwelleth in him, and his gaze

is on distant hills.

LADY FINGERS

So you showed up after all. You're a

braver boy than I thought, so much

the worse for you.

KID

You think I'll be sorry I come?

LADY FINGERS

Bound to. That Lancey ain't human,

he's one of them barracuda fish.

He's liable to bleed to death, right

on a flush hand before he give up to

you. I seen him gut a fella so bad,

the fella quit and got up and spit

red in the john and went square.

LANCEY

Hello, Kid. Pleasure to know you.

KID

Lancey. I been looking forward a

long time.

LANCEY

Sure, sure. You seem to know about

everybody. Yeller from New Orleans?

KID

What do you say, Yeller? Still feeling

salty with me?

YELLER

Forgiven long since.

(to Lancey)

We had a little jurisdictional

dispute.

KID

I hustled a couple of boys, right in

his territory.

YELLER

So I tried to tell him our rules

down there. Colored marks are for

colored hustlers.

KID

And I tried to tell him how I got no

prejudice. When I'm on the edge of

my stake, I hustle anybody at all,

regardless of race, creed or color.

Anybody at all.

YELLER

Including my girl.

KID

Hell, I figured I was doin' you a

favor.

YELLER

You did.

LADY FINGERS

(to Lancey)

Did you know Old Cottonhead died?

LANCEY

No, I hadn't heard.

LADY FINGERS

Heart give out in a high-low game.

LANCEY

(turning to The Kid)

How you feel, Kid?

KID

Great. You?

LANCEY

The best. You think maybe we ought

to see if we can stir up some action?

KID

Whatever you say, Lancey. You're the --

(correcting himself)

You're our guest in this town.

LANCEY

Well, I'm kind of in the mood to

play a little cards.

KID

I think we ought to be able to get a

game together in this crowd.

LANCEY

But first you take a look at things --

make sure everything's the way you

want it. I already been around.

KID

Thanks. I'll do that.

SHOOTER

It's an old table. Everything's pretty

old in this hotel.

KID

It's solid, that's what counts. And

you got the top fixed perfect.

LANCEY

Light all right for you?

SHOOTER

Two hundred watt bulb.

KID

Fine, excellent. Okay with you?

LANCEY

Sure, sure. Shooter's set us up just

great.

KID

Sure has.

SHOOTER

Thank you, gents. Tried to do the

best I could.

(looks from one to

the other)

Cards?

LANCEY

Why not?

KID

Good a time as any.

SHOOTER

(calling)

Hoban! Okay!

(to Kid and Lancey)

You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw

poker man, but clean and straight as

they come.

HOBAN

They come from the St. Louis Bridge

Club, but they're poker size cards.

They been bonded by the club steward

and I seen him take them out of the

safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me

pick them up and come straight here

with them.

SHOOTER

Hoban's selling them to us at five

dollars a pack, with the usual

guarantee. If it's proved any deck

is spooked, he pays off the losers.

LANCEY

St. Louis Bridge Club, eh? Steward

still that old yard bird Okra?

HOBAN

(disturbed)

That's him.

LANCEY

(not noticing; to Kid)

Old stud man, Okra.

KID

I don't know him.

LANCEY

Quite a character. Quite a character.

HOBAN

(anxiously)

Nobody heard from me what the cards

were for, Kid.

LANCEY

(to Kid)

Been ten years since I seen or spoke

to Old Okra.

KID

'Kay, fine. Don't worry about it,

Lancey. Who's sitting down with us,

Shooter?

SHOOTER

Four of us. Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc

Sokal. If that's all right with you

both?

KID

'Kay, fine.

LANCEY

Sure, sure.

(to Kid)

Shall we have a look at the decks?

LANCEY

Well, Kid, what's your game?

KID

I don't mind stud poker if that's

okay with you.

LANCEY

I got no objections to stud.

(to the others)

Gentlemen?

BILL

Tell The Kid I have a suite on the

fifth floor. He can drop up during

the breaks. Bedroom all for him any

time he wants a nap.

SHOOTER

That's thoughtful of you, Bill.

BILL

I'm a thoughtful man. I hope you

are.

LANCEY

Privilege of age. Can't take the

glare of the morning sun in my eyes.

SHOOTER

You want to have the usual brandy

and coffee on hand, Kid? Anything

special for you, Lancey?

LANCEY

Why, yes, Shooter. Creme de menthe

frappe. Green.

SHOOTER

(glances around)

You got that, Hoban?

(to the table)

Gentlemen, if there are no objections,

I'm the dealer. These rooms have

been contracted for, and there will

be an ante of ten dollars per chair,

per day. During the breaks for me,

Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal,

but she don't care to be a player --

LADY FINGERS' VOICE

Do too care!

LADY FINGERS

Can't afford to play, that's the

real truth. Had a bad year and I'm

way over my edge.

SHOOTER

Lady Fingers will get three dollars

an hour from the ante, plus her room

and food, and a five-minute break

every hour. Gents?

LANCEY

Fine, Shooter man.

KID

'Kay with us.

LADY FINGERS

If you don't see me when you need

me, call room three-oh-eight.

(taps Lancey's shoulder)

You know who else ain't with us no

more? Miriam, widow used to run the

kitchen game to South Chi. Lost two

month's Relief at blackjack, coal

dealer cut her credit, and she froze

in her bed.

SHOOTER

Gentlemen, this is a game of five-

card stud poker. There is no limit.

A dead man has one half hour to raise

his roll outside and get back in the

game.

LANCEY

Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I'll put

out the same.

YELLER

I swear I don't know what I'm doing

sitting down with you titans, but

maybe it's worth putting up five

thousand for the educational value.

PIG

I'll play with what I have in my

pocket till I have to send out for

more. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight

hundred, I don't know.

SOKAL

Five G's, I'm with it. Don't mean

I'm goin' blow it all, though.

SHOOTER

Last and certainly least --

SHOOTER

Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and

The Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets.

LANCEY

Ten dollars.

SHOOTER

Dealer folds.

SOKAL

Call the sawbuck.

KID

I'm in.

PIG'S VOICE

Call.

YELLER'S VOICE

Call.

SHOOTER

King to the seven, pair of nines,

deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace-

eight.

KID

Nines bet twenty bucks.

SHOOTER

Queen, ten, king, four, ace again,

and a king for The Shooter.

LANCEY

Ace bets ten dollars

SHOOTER

King over.

HOBAN

Shooter won't stay on a king or an

ace if there's another one showing.

BILL

What's he have to have in the hole?

HOBAN

Ten or better. With no other ten

showing.

LANCEY

New deck.

PIG

Aces over eights.

(waits for a challenge,

but the others turn

their cards)

Thank you, gents.

(as he pulls in money,

to Yeller)

Be a laugh if the two champs ended

up cleaned.

BILL

Any action?

HOBAN

(shrugs)

What do you expect first five or six

hours?

BILL

Still feeling each other out?

HOBAN

Pig's ahead about a grand, Shooter

maybe three hundred.

(TIME LAPSE)

SHOOTER'S VOICE

King bets.

YELLER

King says twenty.

PIG

In for twenty.

SHOOTER

(dealing)

To the nine a ten, to the queen a

seven, to the king a jack, and to

the jack a jack.

LANCEY

Pair of jacks will venture a hundred

dollars.

SOKAL

(who has the nine and

ten of clubs showing)

I'm in.

PIG

(after studying the

board)

Up two hundred dollars.

YELLER

(folding)

Leave it to the rich folk.

BILL

Lancey could be laying for him with

three jacks.

HOBAN

Pig don't think so.

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

Call the two hundred.

SOKAL

I'm sticking.

SHOOTER

Possible straight flush, pair of

sevens. Pair of jacks are still high.

LANCEY

Check to the sevens.

SOKAL

Likewise.

PIG

(trying to be casual)

Bet the size of the pot. Nine hundred

and eighty dollars.

LANCEY

In for nine eighty.

SOKAL

I'll play.

BILL

What's with Lancey? I thought he'd

raise with three jacks or drop with

two pair.

HOBAN

He probably thinks Pig's faking the

queens. Anyhow, Doc's liable take

them both with a straight or a flush.

SHOOTER

Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair

of sevens with a queen gets a nine.

To the pair of jacks, a trey.

PIG

(counting his money,

trying to be calm)

Pair of sevens will bet whatever I

got here. Twenty-four hundred bucks.

LANCEY

I'll call your twenty-four hundred --

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

-- and raise you whatever I have

left.

LANCEY

Comes to fourteen hundred fifty

dollars, Pig. Don't imagine you'll

have any problem promoting that much

in half an hour -- plus whatever you

care to raise me.

SHOOTER

Fourteen fifty to the queens. You

want to take your half hour, Pig?

PIG

No, I'm out. Out of the game.

SHOOTER

(to Pig)

You Tap City?

PIG

I got a woman.

SHOOTER

I thought you and Hilda were quits.

PIG

We're back.

SHOOTER

See you around, Pig.

PLAYERS

(ad lib)

So long, Pig -- See you -- 'Night.

PIG

(getting up)

So long.

PIG

Good luck -- Kid.

SHOOTER

He shouldn't have said that. Not

after taking Tap City from the table.

KID

His woman's been giving him a rough

time. Wants him to quit and go square.

SOKAL

At his age? Crazy.

LANCEY

He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't

bother me. Personally, I don't figure

The Kid needs it.

KID

Thanks, Lancey.

SHOOTER

I know it's early, men, but what

about taking a little break?

BILL

(to Melba)

It always distresses me, a man

reaching his middle years and still

having no assurance of next week's

income.

MELBA

I know what you mean. I like a man

to have plenty of assurance.

LADY FINGERS

Spider Man died kind of slow. First

he give them a kidney, then his gall

bladder, and then they taking his

whole damn stomach. You remember

Spider Man, run the dice table down

at Turk's Club to Memphis.

LANCEY

Who? Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure.

LADY FINGERS

He died kind of slow.

SHOOTER

Need your help, Lady Fingers... to

make arrangements for food and

shelter.

LANCEY

Good crowd.

KID

Yeah. Nice-looking broads.

LANCEY

That's a fact.

KID

That was a pretty thing to watch

what you done to Pig with those jacks.

LANCEY

Thanks, Kid. From you, that's nice

to hear.

KID

When he bet out first, he was ready

to think you had them back to back.

Even when he bet the size of the

pot, he figured there was still a

chance you were laying for him. But

when you called him, I could see it

in his eyes he thought you had jacks

and tens, and I knew you had him

hooked.

LANCEY

You knew, did you? Before I raised?

KID

Oh, sure, I seen what you were pulling

all along.

LANCEY

You been to Miami, Kid?

KID

Not yet.

LANCEY

Beautiful town, lot of loose money

around. You ought to come down some

time.

KID

You mean it?

LANCEY

Sure, sure. Lot of room down there.

Another spot you ought to work someday

is Reno, Nevada.

KID

I heard.

LANCEY

You got to have nerves though. So

much going on. Action everywhere you

turn. You lose the feel of the cards

when you're in so much action day

in, day out.

KID

I'd like to make it out there.

LANCEY

There's different levels of action

there -- you'd find yours, any kind

you could ask for.

KID

I generally stick to stud.

LANCEY

Sure, sure, for eating money. But

you know how it is, I like to lay

off once in a while and try craps.

Nothing serious -- I don't even think

of it as work.

KID

Oh, I do that. I'll take a night off

and shoot a little casino. Or even

blackjack.

LANCEY

Your age, you don't need a regular

vacation every year. But me, I have

to forget the grind for a couple of

weeks. I go to this place near Delray

Beach, and the whole time I don't

play anything but bridge.

KID

That's interesting. I could go for

bridge if there was a way to do it

without partners.

LANCEY

I'm not keeping you from your woman,

am I?

KID

(after a slight

hesitation)

No. We're -- she's gone away for a

while. We're not sure we're looking

for the same thing.

LANCEY

I'm sorry to hear that.

KID

I was hoping Christian would run

with me and wouldn't try to make a

big deal out of it.

LANCEY

But she tried?

KID

Yeah, and now I don't know. I don't

figure a man can change his way

because the way I see it a man's

lucky he's got something going for

him that he can hold on to. A man

can't change his way for a woman.

LANCEY

Nooo, a man can't do that.

KID

I been wondering if it isn't maybe a

better idea not to look for a fixed

thing. Just tie in to something nice

when you're away from the action,

and enjoy it, and let it wear itself

out.

LANCEY

(after a long moment)

That's very interesting you should

say that. You're pretty young to

have figured things out already.

KID

Well she didn't understand how it

was with me and ---

LANCEY

(warmly)

Between us?

KID

There ain't but a few people, I guess

who would understand --

LANCEY

(as The Kid doesn't

finish)

Kid, you're the best stud man I've

seen in 35 years of action. You know

that?

KID

Well -- thank you.

LANCEY

And when it comes to broads, which

is getting to be an academic problem --

I can look back now to the two or

three I ever considered I might want

to spend the rest of my life with,

and you know what? I like it...

looking back on them, that is --

(then)

I always got a lot of companionship

out of a good book.

KID

It's very educational, hearing what

it's like for a man your age.

LANCEY

Glad to be of help. And it's good we

had this little talk so I know we

can be friends regardless what

happens.

KID

That sounds good to me. I didn't

think you was coming in at me like a

grudge match.

LANCEY

No room for any kind of emotion in a

fair game of stud. I learned that a

long time ago.

LADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.)

Ready for some action, gentlemen.

LADY FINGERS

It's a whole New Deal. Good hands

all around. Prosperity for everybody.

LANCEY

You're still good, Fingers.

LADY FINGERS

Getting crippled up, Lancey. Not

many of the old gang left. You heard

Whistling Sam was gone?

LANCEY

No, I didn't hear.

LADY FINGERS

I was the one got called to the morgue

to identify him. I don't suppose you

seen anybody been run over by a twelve-

ton bulldozer.

LANCEY

No, can't say that I have.

LADY FINGERS

Don't go out of your way.

SHOOTER

Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty

dollars.

SOKAL

Fold.

KID

It's yours.

SHOOTER

Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even.

This kind of a game, that's a smart

place to quit.

(takes his money off

the table)

Just do the dealing, if that's all

right with everybody.

SHOOTER

Ace-king is the high man.

SOKAL

Shoot the works.

(counts it out)

Nine hundred and thirty bucks.

YELLER

I'm over.

LANCEY

(putting out the money)

What have you got?

SOKAL

(unhappily)

Doesn't matter. If you can call me,

you beat me. Ace-king high.

LANCEY

(turning an ace)

Ace-king-queen high.

YELLER

(to The Kid)

I had them both with a pair of fives.

SOKAL

Winds it up for me, men. And I can't

say it's been a pleasure.

(despairingly)

That one I was sure I could steal.

YELLER

Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm.

I'm also withdrawing from the field

of battle, gentlemen. Settle for the

seventeen hundred I've already

dropped.

LANCEY

(to The Kid)

Well, just the two of us.

KID

Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them,

Shooter Man.

KID

Cost you a grand.

LANCEY

Compulsory call, Kid.

LANCEY

Two pair, jacks up.

KID

Kings up.

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

Studded again.

LANCEY

Two thousand dollars.

KID

Call two thousand.

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

Two thousand more.

KID

Take it. I can't beat three sevens.

(then as The Shooter's

eyes flicker with

surprise)

I'd like a break to get some food

and sleep -- I'm winners so it isn't

up to me to say it but I'm saying it

anyway.

LANCEY

(pleasantly)

My dear, that young man is a stud

poker-playing son-of-a-bitch.

LADY FINGERS

Gettin' to you, Lancey?

LANCEY

(softly)

Not yet he isn't.

CUT TO:

THE KID

Now, just what the hell are you trying

to pull?

SHOOTER

(trying to bluff it)

Nothing -- what are you talking about?

THE KID

You, Shooter Man -- you been feeding

me cards for an hour.

SHOOTER

(angry and ashamed)

The hell I was.

(he waits a brief

moment then eases

away from The Kid)

Christ, Kid, even if I was you

couldn't spot it -- I'm too good a

mechanic for anybody to spot it.

THE KID

(grabbing him and

slamming him against

the wall again)

But I was looking for it, Shooter --

four times you give me the cards I

need.

SHOOTER

(a little shrill)

You seen it before often enough. One

player draws four good ones.

THE KID

Never in a game when I been told

ahead the dealer has a stake in my

coming out on top.

SHOOTER

(slumping)

My woman told you.

THE KID

She told me enough to make me start

thinking.

SHOOTER

(almost pleading)

Why should you bitch if I give you a

little help?

THE KID

Why, you dumb bastard? -- You have

to ask me why.

(ready to hit him)

I could break you apart for what

you've done.

SHOOTER

(backing off)

Kid, you got to understand. It wasn't

my idea --

THE KID

Well who the hell's was it then --

Schlaegel? --

SHOOTER

He's got the squeeze on me Kid and

he's meaner than hell. He'll cut me

up if I don't come through.

(then)

You think I wanted to deal a phony

game? You think it don't mean

something to me? I never done a

crooked thing before in my life.

THE KID

My ass bleeds for you -- Now you get

straight on this. No fix. You come

along straight or I blow it wide

open.

SHOOTER

He's liable to kill me.

THE KID

He ain't goin' to do nothin' to you

except pay off because I'm goin' to

win.

SHOOTER

It is a hell of a chance to take.

THE KID

You got no choice.

SHOOTER

He ain't goin' to like it.

THE KID

(almost yelling at

him)

He ain't goin' to know.

(then quietly)

Shooter, I'm goin' to win this one --

win it my way -- and you ride with

me or you're out, finished.

SHOOTER

I ride with you.

THE KID

You better not forget it -- now beat

it. I need some sleep.

THE KID

Tell Mr. Schlaegel I accept his offer

to use the room.

THE KID

(into phone)

I want to be called at 4 p.m. on the

nose. For sure -- Thanks.

CUT TO

LANCEY

Not yet he isn't. But he damn well

might.

CUT TO

MELBA

Good afternoon, sir. It's exactly

four o'clock.

MELBA

It's really only about twenty-five

to four. You can stay right where

you are.

THE KID

I don't want you to think I'm getting

too personal, but you mind telling

me how the hell you come to be here?

MELBA

You mean you don't remember last

night? We drank all that champagne

and you said "Let's get married right

away," and we chartered a plane to --

THE KID

Can it --

(then)

Where's Shooter?

MELBA

I locked the door. It's incredible

the way you invariably worry about

The Shooter.

THE KID

It's incredible the way you invariably

don't.

MELBA

Worrying takes time and we don't

have a lot.

THE KID

We're supposed to sit down again at

half past four.

MELBA

Does it really matter so much to you

now, that sense of obligation to The

Shooter?

THE KID

(thinking about Shooter)

I got no obligations to The Shooter.

(then to Melba)

Or to you.

MELBA

Obligations are not what I have in

mind.

CUT TO

CUT TO

THE KID

Reach me a towel?

MELBA

You any idea how much The Shooter

has involved in this game of yours?

THE KID

If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I

heard, I guess he'd pay a nice piece

of change to be sure I won.

MELBA

It's worse than that. Schlaegel staked

him for three years. He has his hooks

so deep in Shooter Man, he'll take

out his liver when he pulls them

out.

THE KID

You asking me to go along with the

fix?

MELBA

I'm asking you to consider whether

your ego is worth destroying another

man's whole life.

THE KID

You're still working for him. On my

time you're still working for him.

MELBA

What kind of switch is this? You

criticize me for trying to chippie

on him, then I get a little loyal

and you're at me for that.

THE KID

No -- I don't hold it against you.

You wanting to make things right for

him -- but this game I handle my way --

win, lose, or draw.

MELBA

Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed

hero.

MELBA

Believe me Kid there is too much at

stake for us to rely on your doing

it on your own.

CHRISTIAN

Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba.

(a pause)

You said wait home 'til you let me

know.

THE KID

Yeah, that's what I said. We took a

break in the game to catch some sleep.

Shooter sent his woman up here to

wake me up.

MELBA

Yeah, I woke him up.

CHRISTIAN

It don't take much.

MELBA

No, I didn't find it any trouble.

(awkwardly)

Well, you children don't need me,

that's for sure. See you downstairs.

(to Christian)

You, too, honey, right?

CHRISTIAN

I'll be around if The Kid wants me.

THE KID

See you, Melba. Thanks.

MELBA

Por nada, as they say. It was nothing.

THE KID

You been to the place?

CHRISTIAN

No, I've got my bag downstairs. Maybe

I'll take it over later on tonight.

THE KID

How's your Mama and Papa?

CHRISTIAN

Fine. How's the game going?

THE KID

It's come to be just me and Lancey.

CHRISTIAN

(after the kiss)

I was wondering.

THE KID

I got my mind on the cards.

CHRISTIAN

I know. And I don't want to rattle

you. We got plenty to talk about,

but it can all wait. Except I want

to say this. I came back because I

figured if it was going to work with

us, it's silly me sitting home with

Mama while you're playing your big

game. I mean if I'm any use to you

at all, this is when it's most

important.

THE KID

I'm glad you came, Christian. You

got as much right here as anybody.

(then)

More right, I should have said.

CHRISTIAN

Should you?

THE KID

Hell, yes. The change I come out

with when I win this one, you're

going to be the one to spend it.

CHRISTIAN

Eric --

THE KID

(turning back)

Look, I said I'm glad you came --

and that's all until I wrap this up --

I'm a poker player, remember?

CUT TO:

THE KID

The eight'll try two bills.

LANCEY

(turning his card)

No stay.

THE KID

Two hundred.

LANCEY

(turning his card)

No stay.

YELLER

Anything?

HOBAN

Naaa, Kid paired kings. He wins a

hundred.

LANCEY

Queen bets another C-note.

THE KID

(folding)

Take it away.

THE KID

Go read a magazine, honey.

LADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.)

All right, gents. I'm declaring a

break.

LADY FINGERS

I break.

THE KID

I don't want a break.

LANCEY

Well, I don't either.

THE KID

Deal.

LANCEY

(snapping)

Same deck is good enough.

THE KID

I want a new deck.

LANCEY

Alright, alright -- A new deck then,

Jesus.

THE KID

Deal.

LADY FINGERS

You want to deal? Then deal them

yourselves. I'm going to the john.

I'm going to get something to eat,

and I'm going to take a nap. You

barracudas can snap all you want but

at each other -- I'm taking a break

and if you don't like it you can

both go to hell.

THE KID

I guess we been told.

LANCEY

Looks that way.

THE KID

(rising)

See you in about 3/4 of an hour,

Lancey, right?

LANCEY

Make it an hour. Old bones need a

little more time to loosen up.

THE KID

(meaning it)

Listen, I think it is amazing you've

been able to keep going this long.

CHRISTIAN

(taking his hand)

Eric --

SHOOTER

(simultaneously)

Your fan on the fifth floor wants

you to have a bite with him. Alone.

KID

There's nothing to talk about.

SHOOTER

You better, Kid. You don't, you're

only making worse trouble.

THE KID

If you think so.

(to Christian)

Sorry.

CHRISTIAN

What's wrong?

THE KID

Nothing, Nothing you have to worry

about. I'll see you later.

THE KID

Get something to eat.

CUT TO:

BILL

I thought it would be better if you

and I sat down together to see if we

couldn't work out our differences.

Felix!

THE KID

What I told The Shooter goes.

BILL

Are you saying no before we've even

discussed it? Am I to feel all my

arguments will be wasted?

BILL

I'll skip to the final argument.

(then)

More salad, perhaps?

BILL

The Shooter will be back dealing

when you start again. He will give

you an occasional helpful card.

THE KID

That's an argument?

BILL

That's a fact. I'm coming to the

argument.

THE KID

I'll give you a fact. I won't let it

happen.

BILL

Is that knife sharp enough? Felix.

BILL

See if it cuts better with that.

BILL

Sharp?

THE KID

Very. But it don't cut any ice with

me.

THE KID

(rising)

Not this time. He exits.

THE KID

Did you eat?

CHRISTIAN

No.

THE KID

(stops, looks at her

irritated)

Why not, for Chris sakes?

CHRISTIAN

Eric --

THE KID

(moving away)

You should eat something.

CHRISTIAN

(loudly, stopping)

I've got to talk to you.

THE KID

Talk.

CHRISTIAN

(fumbling)

It's -- about us. What's going to

happen?

THE KID

(interrupting)

What's going to happen? What's going

to happen for Chris sake is I'm going

to win the game.

(then more softly)

You go back to the apartment, honey,

this might take two more days.

CHRISTIAN

(flatly)

If I go, I'm not going back to the

apartment. If I go -- I'm just going.

THE KID

(after a long moment)

Well, that's up to you, Christian.

CUT TO:

THE KID

I told you, Shooter -- I won't go

for it.

LANCEY

What's up?

THE KID

The Shooter's not well. He didn't

want to spoil the game, but he ought

to be resting... He ought to be in

the hospital.

LANCEY

Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can

deal ourselves.

SHOOTER

I'm okay. What The Kid's talking

about is nothing. It's just not

important.

THE KID

It is to me... You want to kill

yourself, do it on your own time.

LANCEY

I got to go along with that, Shooter.

Lady Fingers! You ready?

LADY FINGERS

Like Eddie the Dude said on his

deathbed, I'm as ready as I'll ever

be.

LANCEY

I can't persuade myself you have the

flush.

LANCEY

Now I can.

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

I'm going to pay the price to look

at that third nine.

LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)

Caveat emptor. New deck, please.

THE KID

Pair of eights bets an even thousand

dollars.

YELLER

Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible

instinct tells me the boy is bluffing

this time.

HOBAN

Mark it.

LANCEY

(turning his cards)

I'm not that curious.

HOBAN

(excitement in his

voice)

The Kid is pushing it and making it

stick.

SHOOTER

(in a low voice)

He's getting to him.

LANCEY

Two hundred.

THE KID

And up five.

LANCEY

Fold.

LANCEY

Betting the jack isn't there, Kid.

SHOOTER

We're in -- I think he's got him.

LADY FINGERS

A jack and a ten. Jack bets.

LANCEY

Jack is willing to wager two hundred

dollars.

THE KID

And up five hundred.

LANCEY

Call your five hundred and five

hundred more.

THE KID

(after a brief

hesitation)

Call.

HOBAN

Fifty to one hundred says Lancey

paired his jacks.

YELLER

Mark it.

LADY FINGERS

Pair of tens. Jack, ten of hearts.

THE KID

Five hundred.

LANCEY

Your five hundred -- and up one

thousand.

HOBAN

Fifty to seventy-five he's got the

jacks wired.

YELLER

Mark it -- Could be a high heart.

Queen's the best, but that old man

can be cocky with an ace or a deuce.

'Specially having one of The Kid's

tens.

LADY FINGERS

One thousand to the tens.

THE KID

Call.

LADY FINGERS

(dealing)

A third ten, and a nine of hearts to

the ten, jack.

HOBAN

He'll run. He's beat on the board

anyway you look at it. Even if he

has the jacks it is better than eight

to one against improving.

YELLER

He won't run and I don't think he's

got the jacks. I think he's going

for the flush.

THE KID

(after a moment)

Two thousand, five hundred dollars.

LADY FINGERS

(finally)

Two thousand, five hundred dollars

to the three hearts.

LANCEY

(finally, casually)

Reasonable bet. Two thousand five

hundred.

(he counts out the

money to Lady Fingers)

Deal them.

SHOOTER

(knowing this is it)

He's going for it and The Kid's got

him. He's going all the way.

LADY FINGERS

(dealing)

A queen of diamonds to the three

tens.

(a note of excitement

in her voice)

And an eight of hearts to the possible

flush. Possible straight flush. Three

tens bet.

HOBAN

If The Kid bets into the flush he's

filled up with a queen in the hole.

YELLER

If The Man has a flush or a straight,

he goes under.

(then)

But not with both.

THE KID

Bet what's in front of me. Make it

fifty-four hundred bucks.

LANCEY

Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice

piece of money.

(counting it out)

I see the bet and raise sixty-seven

hundred.

BILL

Kid has him, doesn't he?

KID

(after a long moment)

I'm taking my half hour to raise my

stake.

LADY FINGERS

I declare a thirty-minute break.

Leave your cards and money on the

table. The game will start again at

five forty-five.

LANCEY

I'll take your marker, Kid.

KID

I can raise it.

LANCEY

I know you can.

KID

Long as you know.

(he raps the table)

-- Call.

LANCEY

(turns up a heart

seven)

Straight flush to the jack -- That's

$6700 you owe me, Kid.

LANCEY

New deck.

LADY FINGERS

Are you playing, Kid? You got a half

an hour to raise your stake.

KID

No -- I'm through.

LADY FINGERS

(formally)

Gentlemen, this game is over.

LANCEY

You're one hell of a poker player,

Kid. That was a rough hand.

KID

Thanks.

LANCEY

What's the tab for the whole show?

MELBA

You had to do it, didn't you -- you

had to go for it your own way.

(then, as The Kid

doesn't answer)

Well, sonny, I hope you learned

something. I know we sure as hell

did.

KID

Where's Christian?

MELBA

She's gone. She's got too much sense

to stick with a two bit loser.

SHOOTER

Shut up.

(then:)

Sorry, Kid.

KID

Yeah.

(then:)

I should have known he had it, Shooter

Man. I walked into it.

SHOOTER

(trying to grin as

Schlaegel and Felix

move up)

Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you

just wasn't ready.

BILL

(to The Shooter)

Are you ready, Shooter Man? We're

having a meeting and I suggest you

join us.

MELBA

Why me -- I'm not part of this.

SHOOTER

(jerking her forward)

Oh, yes you are -- you and your big

mouth -- you're part of it all right.

SCHLAEGEL

He's right, my dear. Now run along

with Felix. We're going to have a

long talk about that big mouth of

yours.

SCHLAEGEL

I was wrong. I figured you for brains.

But you're a loser, Kid. You had a

chance to play with grownups and you

ran.

(then, as Lancey and

Lady Fingers approach)

They weren't playing your game. They

were playing mine. Think about that

while you find a place to hide. But

hide good, Kid -- because I got a

message for you and I'm going to see

it delivered.

THE KID

Any time.

LADY FINGERS

Never thought I'd see the day. You

raising tens on a lousy three-flush.

LANCEY

Gets down to what it's all about,

doesn't it? Making the wrong play at

the right time.

THE KID

(sharply)

That's what it's all about?

(then, as Lancey looks

at him and doesn't

answer)

You were crazy -- odds are three

hundred to one against.

LANCEY

(after a moment)

I don't play a percentage game. I

play stud poker my way. And I got

the money and you got the questions.

Figure that out.

(then, not unkindly)

You're good. But as long as I'm

around, you're second best, Kid...

and you might as well learn to live

with it.

LANCEY

Look me up if you're in Miami after

Christmas. Stillson Hotel.

DANNY

So it ain't Eric Stone, from the

foundry. It's the Cincinnati Kid

King of the stud poker players.

THE KID

No -- not the King -- not much of

anything right now.

DANNY

(moving towards him)

We'll start with giving you back

what you gave me.

CHRISTIAN (O.S.)

Eric --

DANNY

(as she moves toward

them)

Tell her good-bye, sport. You ain't

going any place.

THE KID

I know that.

CHRISTIAN

Are you all right?

THE KID

I'm fine.

(then)

Weren't you going to say good-bye?

CHRISTIAN

I said good-bye.

THE KID

Yeah, I guess you did.

(then)

You don't know if I won or lost do

you?

CHRISTIAN

No -- it doesn't really matter.

(then after a long

moment)

I love you, Kid -- and it's not

enough.

THE KID

Yeah, I know.

TAXI DRIVER

(calling)

Listen, Lady, it's coming on the

morning rush. I got to have one fare

after another or I'm behind for the

day.

FADE OUT

THE END
