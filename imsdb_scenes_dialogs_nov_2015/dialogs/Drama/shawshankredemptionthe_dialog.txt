THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION

by

Frank Darabont

Based upon the story

Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption

by Stephen King

1	INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946)

2	EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2

3	INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3

You stepped out of a dream...

You are too wonderful...

To be what you seem...

4	EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4

WOMAN (O.S.)

Oh god...oh god...oh god...

WOMAN (O.S.)

Oh god...that's sooo good...you're

the best...the best I ever had...

5	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5

D.A. (O.S.)

Mr. Dufresne, describe the

confrontation you had with your

wife the night she was murdered.

ANDY

It was very bitter. She said she

was glad I knew, that she hated all

the sneaking around. She said she

wanted a divorce in Reno.

D.A.

What was your response?

ANDY

I told her I would not grant one.

D.A.

(refers to his notes)

I'll see you in Hell before I see

you in Reno. Those were the words

you used, Mr. Dufresne, according

to the testimony of your neighbors.

ANDY

If they say so. I really don't

remember. I was upset.

D.A.

What happened after you and your

wife argued?

ANDY

She packed a bag and went to stay

with Mr. Quentin.

D.A.

Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the

Falmouth Hills Country Club. The

man you had recently discovered was

her lover.

(Andy nods)

Did you follow her?

ANDY

I went to a few bars first. Later,

I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's

home and confront them. They

weren't there...so I parked my car

in the turnout...and waited.

D.A.

With what intention?

ANDY

I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk.

I think mostly I wanted to scare them.

D.A.

You had a gun with you?

ANDY

Yes. I did.

D.A.

When they arrived, you went up

to the house and murdered them?

ANDY

No. I was sobering up. I realized

she wasn't worth it. I decided to

let her have her quickie divorce.

D.A.

Quickie divorce indeed. A .38

caliber divorce, wrapped in a

handtowel to muffle the shots,

isn't that what you mean? And then

you shot her lover!

ANDY

I did not. I got back in the car

and drove home to sleep it off.

Along the way, I stopped and threw

my gun into the Royal River. I feel

I've been very clear on this point.

D.A.

Yes, you have. Where I get hazy,

though, is the part where the

cleaning woman shows up the next

morning and finds your wife and her

lover in bed, riddled with .38

caliber bullets. Does that strike

you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr.

Dufresne, or is it just me?

ANDY

(softly)

Yes. It does.

D.A.

I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't

think the jury heard that.

ANDY

Yes. It does.

D.A.

Does what?

ANDY

Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.

D.A.

On that, sir, we are in accord...

D.A.

You claim you threw your gun into

the Royal River before the murders

took place. That's rather convenient.

ANDY

It's the truth.

D.A.

You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony?

He and his men dragged that river

for three days and nary a gun was

found. So no comparison can be made

between your gun and the bullets

taken from the bloodstained corpses

of the victims. That's also rather

convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

ANDY

(faint, bitter smile)

Since I am innocent of this crime,

sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient

the gun was never found.

6	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6

D.A.

Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard

all the evidence, you know all the

facts. We have the accused at the

scene of the crime. We have foot

prints. Tire tracks. Bullets

scattered on the ground which bear

his fingerprints. A broken bourbon

bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

Most of all, we have a beautiful

young woman and her lover lying

dead in each other's arms. They had

sinned. But was their crime so

great as to merit a death sentence?

D.A.

I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to

that would be yes. I further

suspect he carried out that

sentence on the night of September

21st, this year of our Lord, 1946,

by pumping four bullets into his

wife and another four into Glenn

Quentin. And while you think about

that, think about this...

D.A.

A revolver holds six bullets, not

eight. I submit to you this was not

a hot-blooded crime of passion!

That could at least be understood,

if not condoned. No, this was

revenge of a much more brutal and

cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four

bullets per victim! Not six shots

fired, but eight! That means he

fired the gun empty...and then

stopped to reload so he could shoot

each of them again! An extra bullet

per lover...right in the head.

(a few JURORS shiver)

I'm done talking. You people are

all decent, God-fearing Christian

folk. You know what to do.

7	INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7

VOICE (O.S.)

Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty...

8	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 8

JUDGE

You strike me as a particularly icy

and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

It chills my blood just to look at

you. By the power vested in me by

the State of Maine, I hereby order

you to serve two life sentences,

back to back, one for each of your

victims. So be it.

9 	AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9

MAN #1

Sit.

MAN #2

We see by your file you've served

twenty years of a life sentence.

MAN #3

You feel you've been rehabilitated?

RED

Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned

my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a

changed man. I'm no longer a danger

to society. That's the God's honest

truth. No doubt about it.

10	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10

RED (V.O.)

There's a con like me in every prison

in America, I guess. I'm the guy who

can get it for you. Cigarettes, a

bag of reefer if you're partial, a

bottle of brandy to celebrate your

kid's high school graduation. Damn

near anything, within reason.

RED (V.O.)

Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears &

Roebuck.

RED (V.O.)

So when Andy Dufresne came to me in

1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita

Hayworth into the prison for him, I

told him no problem. And it wasn't.

CON

Fresh fish! Fresh fish today!

11	INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11

RED (V.O.)

Andy came to Shawshank Prison in

early 1947 for murdering his wife

and the fella she was bangin'.

RED (V.O.)

On the outside, he'd been vice-

president of a large Portland bank.

Good work for a man as young as he

was, when you consider how

conservative banks were back then.

TOWER GUARD

All clear!

HADLEY

On your feet before I fuck you up

so bad you never walk again.

13 	ON THE BLEACHERS 13

RED

There they are, boys. The Human

Charm Bracelet.

HEYWOOD

Never seen such a sorry-lookin'

heap of maggot shit in my life.

JIGGER

Comin' from you, Heywood, you being

so pretty and all...

FLOYD

Takin' bets today, Red?

RED

(pulls notepad and pencil)

Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods?

Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.

FLOYD

Smokes. Put me down for two.

RED

High roller. Who's your horse?

FLOYD

That gangly sack of shit, third

from the front. He'll be the first.

HEYWOOD

Bullshit. I'll take that action.

ERNIE

Me too.

HEYWOOD

You're out some smokes, son. Take

my word.

FLOYD

You're so smart, you call it.

HEYWOOD

I say that chubby fat-ass...let's

see...fifth from the front. Put me

down for a quarter deck.

RED

That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass.

Any takers?

RED (V.O.)

I must admit I didn't think much of

Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

He might'a been important on the

outside, but in here he was just a

little turd in prison grays. Looked

like a stiff breeze could blow him

over. That was my first impression

of the man.

SKEET

What say, Red?

RED

Little fella on the end. Definitely.

I stake half a pack. Any takers?

SNOOZE

Rich bet.

RED

C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me

wrong?

(hands go up)

Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave

souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it,

gentlemen, this window's closed.

VOICE (amplified)

Return to your cellblocks for

evening count.

14	INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14

HADLEY

Eyes front.

NORTON

This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the

guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden.

You are sinners and scum, that's

why they sent you to me. Rule

number one: no blaspheming. I'll

not have the Lord's name taken in

vain in my prison. The other rules

you'll figure out as you go along.

Any questions?

CON

When do we eat?

HADLEY

YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU

PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT

WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP

WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT-

DICK MOTHERFUCKER!

NORTON

Any other questions?

(there are none)

I believe in two things. Discipline

and the Bible. Here, you'll receive

both.

(holds up a Bible)

Put your faith in the Lord. Your

ass belongs to me. Welcome to

Shawshank.

HADLEY

Off with them clothes! And I didn't

say take all day doing it, did I?

HADLEY

First man into the shower!

HADLEY

Delouse that piece of shit! Next

man in!

17	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17

RED (V.O.)

The first night's the toughest, no

doubt about it. They march you in

naked as the day you're born, fresh

from a Bible reading, skin burning

and half-blind from that delousing

shit they throw on you...

RED (V.O.)

...and when they put you in that

cell, when those bars slam home,

that's when you know it's for real.

Old life blown away in the blink of

an eye...a long cold season in hell

stretching out ahead...nothing

left but all the time in the world

to think about it.

RED (V.O.)

Most new fish come close to madness

the first night. Somebody always

breaks down crying. Happens every

time. The only question is, who's

it gonna be?

RED (V.O.)

It's as good a thing to bet on as

any, I guess. I had my money on

Andy Dufresne...

HEYWOOD

Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'.

You know why it's fine?

HEYWOOD

That's right, send 'em all down. I

wanna see 'em lined up in a row,

pretty as a chorus line.

FLOYD

Smell my ass...

HEYWOOD

Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your

horse comin' in last and all.

Hell, I sure do love that horse of

mine. I believe I owe that boy a

big sloppy kiss when I see him.

RED

Give him some'a your cigarettes

instead, cheap bastard.

HEYWOOD

Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty

this week? How's that winnin' horse

of mine, anyway?

TYRELL

Dead.

(the men fall silent)

Hadley busted his head pretty good.

Doc already went home for the

night. Poor bastard lay there till

this morning. By then...

ANDY

What was his name?

HEYWOOD

What? What'd you say?

ANDY

I was wondering if anyone knew his

name.

HEYWOOD

What the fuck you care, new fish?

Doesn't matter what his fuckin'

ANDY

(offers his hand)

Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne.

RED

The wife-killin' banker.

ANDY

How do you know that?

RED

I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd

you do it?

ANDY

I didn't, since you ask.

RED

Hell, you'll fit right in, then.

(off Andy's look)

Everyone's innocent in here, don't

you know that? Heywood! What are

you in for, boy?

HEYWOOD

Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me!

ANDY

What else have you heard?

RED

People say you're a cold fish. They

say you think your shit smells

sweeter than ordinary. That true?

ANDY

What do you think?

RED

Ain't made up my mind yet.

ANDY

I understand you're a man who knows

how to get things.

RED

I'm known to locate certain things

from time to time. They seem to

fall into my hands. Maybe it's

'cause I'm Irish.

ANDY

I wonder if you could get me a

rock-hammer?

RED

What is it and why?

ANDY

You make your customers' motives a

part of your business?

RED

If you wanted a toothbrush, I

wouldn't ask questions. I'd just

quote a price. A toothbrush, see,

is a non-lethal sort of object.

ANDY

Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about

eight or nine inches long. Looks

like a miniature pickaxe, with a

small sharp pick on one end, and a

blunt hammerhead on the other. It's

for rocks.

RED

Rocks.

RED

Quartz?

ANDY

Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale.

Silted granite. There's some graded

limestone, from when they cut this

place out of the hill.

RED

So?

ANDY

I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in

my old life. I'd like to be again,

on a limited scale.

RED

Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy

in somebody's skull?

ANDY

I have no enemies here.

RED

No? Just wait.

RED

Word gets around. The Sisters have

taken a real shine to you, yes they

have. Especially Bogs.

ANDY

Tell me something. Would it help if

I explained to them I'm not

homosexual?

RED

Neither are they. You have to be

human first. They don't qualify.

(off Andy's look)

Bull queers take by force, that's

all they want or understand. I'd

grow eyes in the back of my head if

I were you.

ANDY

Thanks for the advice.

RED

That comes free. But you understand

my concern.

ANDY

If there's trouble, I doubt a rock-

hammer will do me any good.

RED

Then I guess you wanna escape.

Tunnel under the wall maybe?

(Andy laughs politely)

I miss the joke. What's so funny?

ANDY

RED

What's this item usually go for?

ANDY

Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

RED

My standard mark-up's twenty

percent, but we're talkin' about a

special object. Risk goes up, price

goes up. Call it ten bucks even.

ANDY

Ten it is.

RED

I'll see what I can do.

(rises, slapping dust)

But it's a waste of money.

ANDY

Oh?

RED

Folks who run this place love

surprise inspections. They turn a

blind eye to some things, but not

a gadget like that. They'll find

it, and you'll lose it. Mention my

name, we'll never do business

again. Not for a pair of shoelaces

or a stick of gum.

ANDY

I understand. Thank you, Mr...?

RED

Red. The name's Red.

ANDY

Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing

business with you.

RED (V.O.)

I could see why some of the boys

took him for snobby. He had a quiet

way about him, a walk and a talk

that just wasn't normal around

here. He strolled. like a man in a

park without a care or worry. Like

he had on an invisible coat that

would shield him from this place.

(resumes playing catch)

Yes, I think it would be fair to

say I liked Andy from the start.

37	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37

RED (V.O.)

When they check you into this

carrying anything. But a truly

quite a ways up there.

4l	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41

all knew.

47 	ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47

sometimes not.

50 	ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON,

RED (V.O.)

He always fought, that's what I

remember. He fought because he knew

if he didn't fight, it would make

it that much easier not to fight

the next time.

RED (V.O.)

Half the time it landed him in the

infirmary...

51	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ("THE HOLE") -- NIGHT (1949) 51

And that's how it went for Andy. That

him. And I also believe if things

had gone on that way, this place

would have got the best of him.

Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that.

HADLEY

I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off

years ago, family ain't heard of him

since. Figured him for dead anyway.

So this lawyer prick says, your

brother died a rich man. Oil wells

and shit, close to a million bucks.

Jesus, it's frigging incredible how

lucky some assholes can get.

TROUT

A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You

get any of that?

HADLEY

Thirty five thousand. That's what

he left me.

TROUT

Dollars? Holy shit, that's great!

Like winnin' a lottery...

HADLEY

Dumbshit. What do you figger the

government's gonna do to me? Take a

big wet bite out of my ass, is what.

TROUT

Oh. Hadn't thought of that.

HADLEY

Maybe leave me enough to buy a new

car with. Then what happens? You

pay tax on the car. Repairs and

maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin'

you to take 'em for a ride...

MERT

And drive it, if they're old enough.

HADLEY

That's right, wanting to drive it,

wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!

Then at the end of the year, if you

figured the tax wrong, they make

you pay out of your own pocket.

shirt and squeezes your tit till

it's purple. Always get the short

end. That's a fact.

funnier suckin' my dick with no

fuckin' teeth.

ANDY

What I mean is, do you think she'd

go behind your back? Try to

hamstring you?

HADLEY

That's it! Step aside, Mert. This

fucker's havin' hisself an accident.

HEYWOOD

Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's

gonna throw him off the roof...

SNOOZE

Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus...

ANDY

Because if you do trust her, there's

no reason in the world you can't

keep every cent of that money.

HADLEY

You better start making sense.

ANDY

If you want to keep that money, all

of it, just give it to your wife.

See, the IRS allows you a one-time-

only gift to your spouse. It's good

up to sixty thousand dollars.

HADLEY

Naw, that ain't right! Tax free?

ANDY

Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent.

HADLEY

You're the smart banker what shot

his wife. Why should I believe a

smart banker like you? So's I can

wind up in here with you?

ANDY

It's perfectly legal. Go ask the

IRS, they'll say the same thing.

Actually, I feel silly telling you

all this. I'm sure you would have

investigated the matter yourself.

HADLEY

Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart

wife-killin' banker to show me where

the bear shit in the buckwheat.

ANDY

Of course not. But you will need

somebody to set up the tax-free

gift, and that'll cost you. A

lawyer, for example...

HADLEY

Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing

cocksuckers!

ANDY

...or come to think of it, I

suppose I could set it up for you.

That would save you some money.

I'll write down the forms you need,

you can pick them up, and I'll

prepare them for your signature...

nearly free of charge.

(off Hadley's look)

I'd only ask three beers apiece for

my co-workers, if that seems fair.

TROUT

(guffawing)

Co-workers! Get him! That's rich,

ain't it? Co-workers...

ANDY

I think a nan working outdoors

feels more like a man if he can

have a bottle of suds. That's only

my opinion.

HADLEY

What are you jimmies starin' at?

Back to work, goddamn it!

us drink his beer.

HEYWOOD

Here's a cold one, Andy.

ANDY

No thanks. I gave up drinking.

RED (V.O.)

You could argue he'd done it to

curry favor with the guards. Or

maybe make a few friends among us

feel normal again...if only for a

getting a board together.

RED

You come to the right place. I'm

ANDY

We might do business on a board. But

the pieces, I'd like to carve those

myself. One side done in quartz...

the opposing side in limestone.

RED

That'd take you years.

ANDY

Years I've got. What I don't have

Not yet. I suppose I should.

ANDY

ANDY

Brooks? How long have you been

librarian?

BROOKS

Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years.

ANDY

In all that time, have you ever had

an assistant?

BROOKS

Never needed one. Not much to it,

So why now? Why me?

I dunno. Be nice to have some

BROOKS

Pull down one'a them desks there.

ANDY

What did you have in mind? A weekly

draw on your pay?

DEKINS

Yuh. I figured just stick it in the

bank, but Captain Hadley said check

with you first.

ANDY

He was right. You don't want your

money in a bank.

DEKINS

I don't?

ANDY

What's that gonna earn you? Two and

a half, three percent a year? We

can do a lot better than that.

So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do

you want to send your kids?

Harvard? Yale?

92	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1949) 92

HEYWOOD

BROOKS

Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about

shit myself. All Andy needed was a

suit and tie, a jiggly little hula

girl on his desk, he would'a been

Mister Dufresne, if you please.

Makin' yourself some friends, Andy.

ANDY

I wouldn't say "friends." I'm a

sound financial planning. That's a

wonderful pet to have.

RED

Got you out of the laundry, didn't

it?

ANDY

Maybe it can do more than that.

(off their looks)

How about expanding the library?

Get some new books in there.

HEYWOOD

How you 'spect to do that, "Mr.

Dufresne-if-you-please?"

ANDY

Ask the warden for funds.

BROOKS

Son, I've had six wardens through

learned one great immutable truth

of the universe: ain't one of 'em

been born whose asshole don't

pucker up tight as a snare drum

when you ask for funds.

93	INT -- MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY -- DAY (1949) 93

NORTON

Not a dime. My budget's stretched

thin as it is.

ANDY

I see. Perhaps I could write to the

State Senate and request funds

directly from them.

NORTON

Far as them Republican boys in

Augusta are concerned, there's only

three ways to spend the taxpayer's

hard-earned when it come to prisons.

More walls. More bars. More guards.

ANDY

Still, I'd like to try, with your

permission. I'll send a letter a

week. They can't ignore me forever.

They sure can, but you write your

letters if it makes you happy. I'll

even mail 'em for you, how's that?

applied. You see what I'm saying?

Good for you, Andy.

ANDY

Only took six years.

I have no idea to this day what

singin' about. Truth is, I don't

want to know. Some things are best

left unsaid. I like to think they

were singin' about something so

beautiful it can't be expressed in

words, and makes your heart ache

because of it.

RED (V.O.)

I tell you, those voices soared.

Higher and farther than anybody in

a gray place dares to dream. It was

like some beautiful bird flapped

these walls dissolve away...and for

the briefest of moments -- every

FLOYD

Was it worth two weeks in the hole?

ANDY

Easiest time I ever did.

HEYWOOD

Shit. No such thing as easy time in

the hole. A week seems like a year.

ANDY

I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

Hardly felt the time at all.

RED

Oh, they let you tote that record

player down there, huh? I could'a

swore they confiscated that stuff.

ANDY

(taps his heart, his head)

The music was here...and here.

That's the one thing they can't

confiscate, not ever. That's the

beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt

that way about music, Red?

RED

Played a mean harmonica as a younger

man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't

make much sense on the inside.

ANDY

Here's where it makes most sense.

We need it so we don't forget.

RED

Forget?

ANDY

That there are things in this world

not carved out of gray stone. That

there's a small place inside of us

they can never lock away, and that

place is called hope.

RED

Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a

kept writing to the State Senate.

Two letters a week instead of one.

RED (V.O.)

In 1959, the folks up Augusta way

finally clued in to the fact they

couldn't buy him off with just a

200 dollar check. Appropriations

Committee voted an annual payment of

500 dollars, just to shut him up.

157	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157

You'd be amazed how far Andy could

stretch it. He made deals with book

HEYWOOD

Treasure Island. Robert Louis...

ANDY

...Stevenson. Next?

RED

I got here an auto repair manual,

HEYWOOD

RED (V.O.)

That was also the year Warden Norton

instituted his famous "Inside-Out"

program. You may remember reading

about it. It made all the papers

and got his picture in LIFE magazine.

NORTON

...a genuine, progressive advance

in corrections and rehabilitation.

Our inmates, properly supervised,

will be put to work outside these

walls performing all manner of

public service. Cutting pulpwood,

repairing bridges and causeways,

digging storm drains...

NORTON

These men can learn the value of an

honest day's labor while providing

a valuable service to the community

-- and at a bare minimum of expense

to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer!

HEYWOOD

Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me.

RED

Nobody asked you.

HEYWOOD

No, ma'am.

164	EXT -- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY (1965) 164

RED (V.O.)

'Course, Norton failed to mention

to the press that "bare minimum of

expense" is a fairly loose term.

There are a hundred different ways

to skim off the top. Men,

materials, you name it. And, oh my

Lord, how the money rolled in...

NED

This keeps up, you're gonna put me

out of business! With this pool of

slave labor you got, you can

underbid any contractor in town.

NORTON

Ned, we're providing a valuable

community service.

NED

That's fine for the papers, but I

got a family to feed. The State

don't pay my salary. Sam, we go

back a long way. I need this new

highway contract. I don't get it, I

go under. That's a fact.

(hands him a box)

Now you just have some'a this fine

pie my missus baked specially for

you, and you think about that.

NORTON

Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over

this contract. Seems to me I've

already got my boys committed

elsewhere. You be sure and thank

Maisie for this fine pie.

always.

NORTON

Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two

suits for dry-clean and a bag of

whatnot. Tell 'em if they over-

starch my shirts again, they're

gonna hear about it from me.

(adjusts his tie)

How do I look?

ANDY

Very nice.

NORTON

Big charity to-do up Portland

RED

Got his fingers in a lot of pies,

ANDY

What you hear isn't half of it.

He's got scams you haven't dreamed

of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

There's a river of dirty money

flowing through this place.

RED

Money like that can be a problem.

Sooner or later you gotta explain

where it came from.

ANDY

That's where I come in. I channel

it, funnel it, filter it...stocks,

securities, tax free municipals...

I send that money out into the big

world. And when it comes back...

RED

It's clean as a virgin's whistle?

ANDY

Cleaner. By the time Norton retires,

I will have made him a millionaire.

RED

Jesus. They ever catch on, he's

gonna wind up wearing a number

himself.

ANDY

(smiles)

I thought you had more faith in me

than that.

RED

I'm sure you're good, but all that

paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets

too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever --

that trail's gonna lead to somebody.

ANDY

Sure it will. But not to me, and

certainly not to the warden.

RED

Who then?

ANDY

Peter Stevens.

RED

Who?

ANDY

The silent, silent partner. He's

the guilty one, your Honor. The man

with the bank accounts. That's

where the filtering process starts.

They trace it back, all they're

gonna find is him.

RED

Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?

ANDY

A phantom. An apparition. Second

cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

(off Red's look)

I conjured him out of thin air. He

doesn't exist...except on paper.

RED

You can't just make a person up.

ANDY

Sure you can, if you know how the

system works, and where the cracks

are. It's amazing what you can

accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has

a birth certificate, social

security card, driver's license.

They ever track those accounts,

they'll wind up chasing a figment

of my imagination.

RED

Jesus. Did I say you were good?

You're Rembrandt.

ANDY

It's funny. On the outside, I was

an honest man. Straight as an

arrow. I had to come to prison to

be a crook.

168	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965)

RED

Does it ever bother you?

ANDY

I don't run the scams, Red, I just

process the profits. That's a fine

line, maybe. But I've also built

that library, and used it to help a

dozen guys get their high school

diplomas. Why do you think the

warden lets me do all that?

RED

To keep you happy and doing the

laundry. Money instead of sheets.

I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

'Bout four years ago, I was in

Few months left to go, I get a new

cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big

twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of

roomie you pray you don't get, know

what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed

burglary. Said he done hundreds of

jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung

as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go

three feet in the air. Talked all

the time, too, that's the other

thing. Never shut up. Places he'd

been, jobs he pulled, women he

fucked. Even people he killed.

People that gave him shit, that's

how he put it. One night, like a

joke, I say: "Yeah? Who'd you

kill?" So he says...

BLATCH

...I got me this job one time

bussin' tables at a country club.

So I could case all the big rich

pricks that come in. I pick out

this guy, go in one night and do

his place. He wakes up and gives

me shit. So I killed him. Him and

the tasty bitch he was with.

(starts laughing)

That's the best part! She's fuckin'

this prick, see, this golf pro, but

she's married to some other guy!

Some hotshot banker. He's the one

they pinned it on! They got him

ANDY

Sir?

NORTON

It's obvious this fellow Williams

is impressed with you. He hears

your tale of woe and quite

naturally wants to cheer you up.

He's young, not terribly bright.

Not surprising he didn't know what

a state he'd put you in.

ANDY

I think he's telling the truth.

NORTON

Let's say for a moment Blatch does

exist. You think he'd just fall to

his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it!

I confess! By all means, please add

a life term to my sentence!"

ANDY

It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's

testimony, I can get a new trial.

NORTON

That's assuming Blatch is even

still there. Chances are excellent

he'd be released by now. Excellent.

ANDY

They'd have his last known address.

Names of relatives...

(Norton shakes his head)

Well it's a chance. isn't it? How

can you be so obtuse?

NORTON

What? What did you call me?

ANDY

Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The

country club will have his old time

cards! W-2s with his name on them!

NORTON

Dufresne, if you want to indulge

this fantasy, that's your business.

Don't make it mine. This meeting's

ANDY

Look, if it's the squeeze, don't

worry. I'd never say what goes on

ANDY

My wife used to say I'm a hard man

to know. Like a closed book.

Complained about it all the time.

(pause)

She was beautiful. I loved her. But

I guess I couldn't show it enough.

(softly)

I killed her, Red.

ANDY

I didn't pull the trigger. But I

drove her away. That's why she

died. Because of me, the way I am.

RED

That don't make you a murderer. Bad

husband, maybe.

RED

Feel bad about it if you want. But

you didn't pull the trigger.

ANDY

No. I didn't. Someone else did, and

I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess.

RED

Bad luck? Jesus.

ANDY

It floats around. Has to land on

somebody. Say a storm comes

through. Some folks sit in their

living rooms and enjoy the rain.

The house next door gets torn out

of the ground and smashed flat. It

was my turn, that's all. I was in

the path of the tornado.

(softly)

I just had no idea the storm would

go on as long as it has.

(glances to him)

Think you'll ever get out of here?

RED

Sure. When I got a long white beard

and about three marbles left

rolling around upstairs.

ANDY

Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.

RED

Zihuatanejo?

ANDY

Mexico. Little place right on the

Pacific. You know what the Mexicans

say about the Pacific? They say it

has no memory. That's where I'd

like to finish out my life, Red. A

warm place with no memory. Open a

little hotel right on the beach.

Buy some worthless old boat and fix

it up like new. Take my guests out

charter fishing.

(beat)

You know, a place like that, I'd

need a man who can get things.

RED

Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on

the outside. Been in here too long.

I'm an institutional man now. Like

old Brooks Hatlen was.

ANDY

You underestimate yourself.

RED

Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who

can get it for you. Out there, all

you need are Yellow Pages. I

wouldn't know where to begin.

(derisive snort)

Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare

me to death, somethin' that big.

ANDY

Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and

I didn't shoot her lover, and

whatever mistakes I made I've paid

for and then some. That hotel and

that boat...I don't think it's too

much to want. To look at the stars

just after sunset. Touch the sand.

Wade in the water. Feel free.

RED

Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do

that to yourself! Talking shitty

pipedreams! Mexico's down there,

and you're in here, and that's the

way it is!

ANDY

You're right. It's down there, and

I'm in here. I guess it comes down

to a simple choice, really. Get

busy living or get busy dying.

RED

Andy?

ANDY

(turns back)

Red, if you ever get out of here,

do me a favor. There's this big

hayfield up near Buxton. You know

where Buxton is?

RED

(nods)

Lots of hayfields there.

ANDY

One in particular. Got a long rock

wall with a big oak at the north

end. Like something out of a Robert

Frost poem. It's where I asked my

(MORE)

ANDY (cont.)

wife to marry me. We'd gone for a

picnic. We made love under that

tree. I asked and she said yes.

(beat)

Promise me, Red. If you ever get

out, find that spot. In the base of

that wall you'll find a rock that

has no earthly business in a Maine

hayfield. A piece of black volcanic

glass. You'll find something buried

under it I want you to have.

RED

What? What's buried there?

ANDY

You'll just have to pry up that

rock and see.

mountain-building there, plates of

bedrock grinding against each other

over a span of millennia...

233	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233
