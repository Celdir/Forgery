LUCY

Hello. Hello?

MARTHA

Hi!

LUCY

Martha?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

Oh my god! Where are you?

MARTHA

I'm not sure. Upstate I think.

LUCY

You're in New York?

MARTHA

I think. Yeah.

LUCY

When did you get back?

4.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?

MARTHA

I don't know. I should go back.

LUCY

Go back where?

MARTHA

I have to go, I can't stay gone.

LUCY

No, no, no. Don't go. What are you

talking about?

MARTHA

Sorry for calling.

LUCY

Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not

hang up.

(BEAT)

Do you want me to come get you?

MARTHA

I can't wait that long.

LUCY

What do you mean? Tell me where you are

and I'll come right now.

MARTHA

It's okay, you don't have to-

LUCY

I want to see you Martha. Please.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Martha!

5.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Marcy May?

WATTS

What are you doin'?

WATTS (CONT'D)

We were worried about you.

MARTHA

I'm fine.

WATTS

Patrick's worried about you.

MARTHA

I just wanted to come into town.

WATTS

I could've brought you.

MARTHA

I wanted to walk.

WATTS

Through the woods?

WAITRESS

(TO WATTS)

Can I get you something?

WATTS

No.

WAITRESS

(TO MARTHA)

You done?

MARTHA

Yeah.

6.

WATTS

(TO MARTHA)

You not gonna eat that?

WATTS (CONT'D)

You ready to go?

WATTS (CONT'D)

Come on!

MARTHA

Not right now.

WATTS

No?

WATTS (CONT'D)

I'll get this.

7.

LUCY

It's nice to see you.

MARTHA

You too.

LUCY

What's going on?

MARTHA

Not much.

LUCY

You alright?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

You sure?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

You were pretty upset on the phone.

MARTHA

Sorry. I over reacted.

8.

LUCY

To what?

LUCY (CONT'D)

What happened?

MARTHA

We had a fight.

LUCY

Who?

MARTHA

Me and this guy.

LUCY

Who?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Your boyfriend?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Did he hurt you?

MARTHA

No!

LUCY

Are you sure?

MARTHA

No. I'm fine.

LUCY

Did you guys break up?

LUCY (CONT'D)

How long were you together?

MARTHA

A while.

9.

LUCY

How long?

MARTHA

I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or

less.

LUCY

And you were here the whole time?

LUCY (CONT'D)

You've been back in New York for over a

year and you haven't called me?

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

LUCY

Well, I'm glad you're here now.

LUCY

I made you some tea.

MARTHA

Thanks.

LUCY

Ted should be up from the city soon.

He'll cook us some dinner.

MARTHA

I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go

to bed?

LUCY

Of course.

(BEAT)

Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new

tomorrow.

10.

TED

Well?

LUCY

She seems okay.

TED

What did she say?

LUCY

Not much, she's pretty tired.

TED

Where's she been?

LUCY

She had some boyfriend, they were living

in the Catskills.

TED

What?

LUCY

It's okay.

TED

Not really Lucy.

LUCY

It's fine. She's here now.

TED

(HALF JOKING)

Well, how long's she staying?

LUCY

(LAUGHING)

I don't know.

11.

TED

I told you she was fine. You spend all

that time worrying.

CUT TO:

LUCY

Martha? Why are you on the floor?

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

LUCY

It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come

have some breakfast.

TED

Martha! Welcome!

MARTHA

Hi.

12.

TED

Great to finally meet you. You sleep

alright?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

How do you like the house?

TED

It's just a rental.

LUCY

Well I love it.

MARTHA

It's nice. I didn't know there was a

lake.

LUCY

Yeah. Do you still like to swim?

MARTHA

You don't live in the city anymore?

LUCY

We do. This is for weekends and holidays.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Ted's finishing a new building down town

and when it's done we're taking one of

the new apartments. You want to see

pictures?

TED

(TO MARTHA)

Do you think she's excited to have you

back?

LUCY

This is the view, the interiors are

obviously not finished. It's nice right?

(MORE)

13.

LUCY (CONT'D)

We were supposed to move in the spring

but construction halted, so, it'll just

be a little while longer.

TED

(SARCASTIC)

Yep, just a little while longer.

LUCY

Okay, sorry, no more work talk.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Aren't you hungry?

MARTHA

Not really, sorry.

TED

Well, you've got to eat.

LUCY

It's okay, I can fix you something later.

MARTHA

Where are we?

LUCY

Connecticut.

MARTHA

How far are we?

LUCY

From what?

MARTHA

Yesterday.

LUCY

You mean where I picked you up?

14.

LUCY (CONT'D)

About 3 hours.

(BEAT)

Why?

MARTHA

Just wondered.

CUT TO:

ZOE

Put out your cigarette.

MARTHA

(SMILING)

Why?

ZOE

Just do it.

MARTHA

Is that him?

ZOE

Yeah.

(CALLING OUT)

Hey!

15.

PATRICK

Is this Martha?

MARTHA

Hi!

PATRICK

How're you doing?

MARTHA

Great. You've got a really nice place

here.

PATRICK

It's as much yours as it is mine.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I thought you quit?

ZOE

I did.

PATRICK

It's disgusting.

ZOE

I know. I'm sorry.

PATRICK

Don't apologize to me, it's your body.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Look after this girl properly Zoe, she

deserves some real care for once in her

life.

ZOE

I will.

MARTHA

She's been great, everyone's been great.

PATRICK

Good.

(BEAT)

You look like a Marcy May.

16.

MARTHA

Marcy was my grandmothers name.

PATRICK

Well, there you go.

TED (O.S.)

I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join?

MARTHA

Sure.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

You coming?

TED

(SMIRKING)

Brilliant choice of swim wear.

LUCY

Martha! What are you doing?

MARTHA

What?

LUCY

Would you put some clothes on, you can't

swim naked.

17.

MARTHA

Why?

LUCY

You just can't. There are kids around and

people come by.

MARTHA

So?

LUCY

So you can't. We don't, just don't. I

have a bathing suit you can borrow.

LUCY

Martha!

(BEAT)

I've been trying to wake you. You should

get up or you won't sleep through the

night.

LUCY (CONT'D)

You should eat.

MARTHA

I will. I'm just going to sleep a little

more first okay?

LUCY

Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you

before.

MARTHA

It's okay.

18.

TED

She's not coming?

LUCY

She's in a really deep sleep. I can't

wake her.

TED

She seems a bit off, no?

LUCY

She's just really tired.

(BEAT)

She's had a bad breakup. I want to give

her a couple days to get situated, you

know?

TED

Has she always been like this?

LUCY

A pain in my ass, yes.

CUT TO:

MAX

Hey Marcy.

19.

MARTHA

Hey Max.

(BEAT)

Where do they go at night?

MAX

I don't know, I never get invited.

MAX (CONT'D)

You want to have a drink with me?

MAX (CONT'D)

They won't be back for a few hours.

MARTHA

I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for

awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.

MAX

Alright.

MARTHA

Patrick'll know.

MAX

It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.

KATIE

We switch off jobs each day so we all

know how to do different things.

(BEAT)

Do you knit?

20.

MARTHA

No. I can learn though.

KATIE

It's okay, you'll find your role. It

takes time for people to find their role

in a new family.

KATIE (CONT'D)

We sell blankets in town. We still need

some money, but when the farm's up and

running we'll be self sufficient and

we'll never have to worry about it again.

MARTHA

When do you think that'll happen?

KATIE

Hopefully by the end of the summer but

we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and

live stock without cash.

MARTHA

That'll be nice.

KATIE

Shoot.

PATRICK

How's everything going so far Marcy May?

MARTHA

Good.

21.

PATRICK

You like it here?

MARTHA

Yeah, it's really nice.

PATRICK

I want you to feel at home.

MARTHA

I do. Thanks.

PATRICK

People have abandoned you your whole

life. I don't blame you for not trusting

anyone.

MARTHA

What?

PATRICK

If you ever want to have a meaningful

relationship, you need to let your guard

down.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

It's not your fault, but it's there. If

you feel safe here, and I think you do,

let us in. We just want to help you.

ZOE

Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.

PATRICK

If you're going to live here then really

be apart of things.

LUCY

Good morning. How are you feeling today?

MARTHA

Good.

LUCY

There's this great juice shop in town, I

got us a couple of juices.

(MORE)

22.

LUCY (CONT'D)

This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives

me energy, so I thought it might help

you.

Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I got pineapple orange too if that's

better.

MARTHA

Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.

LUCY

I also got a box of these protein bars

just in case you want to snack.

MARTHA

Why is the house so big?

LUCY

It's not that big.

MARTHA

For two people, it's huge.

LUCY

We like to entertain. Our friends

come up for weekends and sometimes

we have parties. It's just good to

have space.

MARTHA

So no one else lives here?

LUCY

Of course no one else lives here.

EXT. LAKE / BOAT - DAY

It is hot, sunny, and peaceful. Martha sits cross legged.

Ted reads the newspaper. Lucy sunbathes. Martha notices

they wear wedding rings.

MARTHA

(SURPRISED)

You're married?

LUCY

Yeah.

23.

MARTHA

When?

LUCY

Earlier this year, in the spring.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I tried to get in touch with you,

apparently you got rid of your cell

phone?

MARTHA

I lost it.

LUCY

You never got a new one?

MARTHA

I got used to not having it.

TED

Cocktail anyone?

LUCY

No thanks.

TED

Martha?

MARTHA

Was it a big wedding?

LUCY

No, about forty people. Mostly his

family.

MARTHA

(SMIRKING)

Did Aunt Dora come?

LUCY

Yeah.

MARTHA

Did she smoke like chimney and complain

about everything.

24.

LUCY

She's not that bad.

MARTHA

You never had to live with her.

TED

You lived with Dora?

MARTHA

She lived with me after mom died.

TED

(TO LUCY)

Where were you?

LUCY

College.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're

okay.

MARTHA

(SMILING)

She hates me.

LUCY

She doesn't hate you.

(BEAT)

Look at me.

MARTHA

I hate her.

LUCY

Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.

(LUCY FOCUSES)

Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.

LUCY (CONT'D)

There you go!

25.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Don't shake it, that's a myth.

MARTHA

Is it true married people don't fuck?

LUCY

What? No!

LUCY

Put this on.

MARTHA

You're kidding.

LUCY

Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just

try it.

MARTHA

Why does it matter?

LUCY

It just feels good to put on something

nice and comfortable.

LUCY (CONT'D)

It looks good you little shit.

MARTHA

Whatever makes you happy mama bear.

LUCY

You're making fun of me and I think it

looks really good.

26.

Martha wears Lucy's dress. Ted, Lucy and Martha sit

around the table eating dinner.

Ted picks at the food.

LUCY

It's no good?

TED

It's good, it's just, a bit dry.

LUCY

It's not dry.

LUCY (CONT'D)

It just needs a little salt. What are you

laughing about I cooked for you your

whole life.

MARTHA

You microwaved chicken nuggets and

fish sticks.

Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the

table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.

INT. LAKE HOUSE / TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ted and Lucy get ready for bed.

TED

She seems better today.

LUCY

Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go

tomorrow.

TED

Let me take you.

LUCY

No, I don't want to leave her alone.

(BEAT)

You'll be nice to her right?

TED

I'm always nice.

27.

LUCY

Right.

CUT TO:

KATIE

I know you feel like something bad just

happened Marcy May, but you have to trust

me, that was not bad, it was truly good.

We've all been in this situation, and we

wouldn't all still be here if what

happened in that room was bad. We all

love each other very much, we are all

together on this, you have to trust us.

(BEAT)

Do you believe me?

28.

ZOE

You're so lucky, I'd give anything to

have my first time again.

MARTHA

Really?

ZOE

Yeah, it's so special.

MARTHA

I can't remember anything, I just woke up

on the floor and felt this pain -

ZOE

That's the cleansing. It's good. It means

it's working if you can't remember

things. You're cleansing yourself of the

past and the toxins.

Martha is distant.

ZOE (CONT'D)

You need to share yourself, don't be so

selfish.

MARTHA

I'm not.

ZOE

So smile then, enjoy this amazing night.

It only happens once.

Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They

curl up together in a very intimate way.

Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is

caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on

the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.

EXT. FARM - DAY

He tunes his guitar.

PATRICK

This one's called Marcy's song.

29.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Well she, she's just a picture.

Who lives on my wall

Well she, she's just a picture

And the reason, reason, reason it is so

small.

With a smile so inviting and a body so

tall, She, she's just a picture

Just a picture

THAT'S ALL

Well you stand there, stand there with

the nightshade,

Her dripping ripping down your hands

And you ask me, ask me about the

LIGHTNING

And the lady, lady, lady she understands

It's a dream for the future and the water

for the sands

And the strangeness is wandering Through

many callin' lands

TED

What are you doing?

MARTHA

Cleaning.

(BEAT)

I thought I'd help out more.

TED

Alright. I'm going to take the boat out,

do you want to come?

30.

MARTHA

Is Lucy coming?

TED

She had to run to the city.

MARTHA

Oh.

TED

I'll teach you how to drive the boat,

come on.

MARTHA

It's okay.

TED

Come on.

TED

You want one?

TED (CONT'D)

Beautiful day.

MARTHA

Yeah.

TED

How have things been with you and Lucy?

MARTHA

Fine.

31.

TED

Is it strange to spend time together?

MARTHA

No. Why?

TED

It's been a long time.

MARTHA

I don't know, it's normal I guess. She

hasn't changed much.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Where is she?

TED

At the doctor.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

She's getting a check up.

(BEAT)

We're trying to have a baby.

TED (CONT'D)

What?

MARTHA

I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.

TED

Why?

MARTHA

She wouldn't know what to do with it.

(BEAT)

Do you want a baby?

TED

I want what Lucy wants.

(SMILING)

If she's happy, I'm happy.

32.

MARTHA

(SMILING)

So you're unhappy!

TED

No. She's good. She's relieved to have

you back. You had her worried.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

You disappeared. You haven't called in

two years!

MARTHA

I lost track I guess.

TED

It's good to let people know where you

are Martha. People worry.

MARTHA

I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.

TED

Well, she did.

MARTHA

Can I go swimming?

TED

You don't need to ask.

33.

PATRICK

You jump yet?

MARTHA

No.

PATRICK

Go on.

WATTS

You ready?

MARTHA

I can't.

WATTS

Sure you can.

She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills

with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She

continues to swim, the camera follows her under water.

The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.

INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks

down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She

walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him

and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe

and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and

comforting.

CUT TO:

34.

LUCY

(STARTLED)

What? What?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Martha, what are you doing?

MARTHA

Nothing!

LUCY

Jesus, you can't just come in like that.

MARTHA

Sorry.

LUCY

God damn it, what's wrong?

MARTHA

It's been hard to sleep alone.

TED

All you do is sleep.

35.

LUCY

(TO MARTHA)

Stay, just stay.

LUCY (CONT'D)

(UPSET)

Why would you think it was okay to come

in like that?

MARTHA

I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys

were on the other side.

LUCY

You can't come into our room when we're

having sex, that's not normal! It's

private.

MARTHA

Sorry.

LUCY

Don't apologize, I just want you to

understand why it's not okay.

MARTHA

Okay.

LUCY

Do you?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

Well?

MARTHA

Because it's privte and it's not normal.

LUCY

Just lie down Martha.

36.

TED

This is just brilliant.

CUT TO:

LUCY

I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for

being patient.

TED

I don't have much choice do I?

LUCY

I just want to make sure she's okay.

TED

I get two weeks a year to come out here

and try to relax before I have to go back

to work!

LUCY

I know.

TED

I am under so much pressure right now-

LUCY

I know you are.

TED

I have a month to get this building up

and running or the bank takes it.

LUCY

That has nothing to do with Martha.

37.

TED

My point is, I don't need the extra

stress.

LUCY

I'm her only family. She needs to be able

to depend on me right now.

(BEAT)

It's complicated Ted.

TED

As complicated as it might be, we can't

just keep ignoring the fact that her

behavior is fucking insane.

MARTHA

Do you ever hear things hitting the roof

at night?

LUCY

No. Maybe it's the pine cones.

(BEAT)

Where did you pick up gardening?

MARTHA

We had a garden where I lived?

LUCY

You're good.

MARTHA

I'm good at some things.

LUCY

I know you are.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Was he ever physical with you?

MARTHA

Who?

LUCY

Your boyfriend.

38.

MARTHA

What do you mean?

LUCY

Did he ever, hit you?

MARTHA

No.

LUCY

You had a bruised ear, and when you

called me you were hysterical.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Are you sure?

MARTHA

Yes.

LUCY

You can tell me.

MARTHA

He never hit me.

LUCY

I wish you felt more comfortable talking

to me.

MARTHA

I do.

LUCY

So talk.

MARTHA

There's nothing to talk about. I had a

boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's

it, everything doesn't have to be a big

DEAL

39.

KATIE

(TO MARTHA)

Don't stare!

MARTHA

You okay?

ZOE

Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so

weak.

MARTHA

You're not. You'll quit.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Who's that?

KATIE

Her name's Sarah I think.

KATIE (CONT'D)

(TO MARTHA)

You should handle her.

MARTHA

You think?

KATIE

You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be

great.

MARTHA

Whose car was that?

40.

LUCY

I don't know. Why?

MARTHA

Just curious.

LUCY

There's a hiking trail, people leave

their cars there all the time.

LUCY

Sorry.

YOUNG MAN

It's okay.

LUCY

You're going to hurt someone.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Can you go get me a large jug of water.

MARTHA

What's wrong with the tap?

LUCY

I like bottled.

MARTHA

It's a waste.

LUCY

Will you get it or not?

41.

MARTHA

Did you know that guy?

LUCY

What guy?

MARTHA

The guy in the store.

LUCY

The one you almost ran into? No.

MARTHA

He was looking at me like he knew me.

(BEAT)

Did you say something to him?

LUCY

Like what?

MARTHA

I don't know, you tell me.

LUCY

What are you talking about?

MARTHA

(FRUSTRATED)

He was staring at me like he knew me, did

you talk to him about me?

LUCY

(EMPHATICALLY)

No. Jesus. The guy was checking you out

Martha! Relax.

(Lucy starts the car.)

(MORE)

42.

LUCY (CONT'D)

If you don't want guys to drool all over

you, then wear more clothes-

MARTHA

Just drive the car Lucy.

LUCY

What?

MARTHA

Drive the car!

LUCY

I don't think we should have the party.

TED

It's labor day, we always have it.

LUCY

Things are just too stressful right now.

TED

I've already invited clients.

LUCY

I'm sure people would understand-

TED

They wouldn't.

LUCY

I just think it would be best.

TED

For who, Martha?

LUCY

For all of us.

TED

It's not an option! We're having the

party.

LUCY

And that's the end of it, because you say

so.

43.

TED

Yes!

MARTHA

We share all of this, if it fits, you can

wear it.

SARAH

Cool.

MARTHA

This is where we sleep. You can take any

bed that's open or you can sleep

downstairs.

SARAH

I'm hungry, can we eat?

MARTHA

We don't eat until the evening.

SARAH

Really?

MARTHA

You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't

need that much food. You're taught to

overconsume.

SARAH

He's beautiful. Whose the mother?

MARTHA

Katie's, but we all help out.

SARAH

Is Patrick the father?

44.

MARTHA

Uh huh.

SARAH

They look just like him.

(BEAT)

All the kids here are boys?

MARTHA

He only has boys.

SARAH

You're good with them.

MARTHA

You want to hold him?

SARAH

No Thanks.

(BEAT)

I don't have to take care of them do I?

MARTHA

Not if you don't want to. There are

plenty of jobs to be done.

(BEAT)

You'll find your role. It takes time for

people to find their role in a new

family.

ZOE

(TO MARTHA)

I called my dad today to ask for money.

MARTHA

Does Patrick know?

ZOE

He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's

something we really need I'll call.

MARTHA

How was it?

45.

ZOE

Fine, they're not bad people.

MARTHA

Did he give you the money?

ZOE

Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.

MARTHA

Do you tell him you're not?

ZOE

No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess

he'd rather pay for it than think I'm

sucking dick for it.

SARAH

I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried

everything pretty much, except heroin.

ZOE

It's good to try everything at least

once. You find out who you are that way.

What about drinking, do you drink?

SARAH

I have, but I don't.

ZOE

Good, we don't drink. It just makes you

angry and less focused.

MARTHA

Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't

talk to our old families.

SARAH

I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter

how much he paid me.

PATRICK

Hey.

MARTHA

Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?

PATRICK

Sally, yeah.

CUT TO:

46.

KATIE

That's enough.

KATIE (CONT'D)

Half is fine.

LUCY

I'll do these if you want to go to bed.

MARTHA

I don't mind.

LUCY

Get some sleep.

MARTHA

Okay.

47.

MARTHA

Oh, hi.

SARAH

Hi.

SARAH (CONT'D)

What do I have to do?

MARTHA

Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it

will help you relax.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

It's herbal. It's the start of your

cleansing.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

We've all done it so you know there's

nothing to worry about.

SARAH

Do I have to wear this robe?

MARTHA

(WHISPERING)

I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a

part of it.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

You look amazing. It's your special night

with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.

SARAH

Thanks.

48.

MARTHA

Shouldn't we start cooking?

LUCY

I just made some potato salad. Ted's

cooking the fish.

MARTHA

I thought we were going to cook.

LUCY

We cooked last night.

MARTHA

Oh, yeah.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Do you ever have this thing where you

can't tell if something's a memory or if

it's something you've dreamed?

LUCY

Not really.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Do you blame me for anything?

MARTHA

No.

(BEAT)

Like what?

49.

LUCY

MARTHA

LUCY

MARTHA

50.

LUCY

No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm

just wondering if I should have come back

and kept you in school and helped you go

to college, you had so much potential.

MARTHA

I don't need your guidance, I never did.

I'm a teacher and a leader, you just

never let me be that but now I know I am,

I know who I am.

LUCY

Teacher and a leader? What are you

talking about? I always encouraged you to

do more, but you shut me out.

LUCY (CONT'D)

MARTHA-

MARTHA

Just because we're sisters doesn't mean

we need to talk about everything that

comes into your head.

TED (O.S.)

(YELLING)

Dinner's ready.

TED

So what are your plans Martha?

MARTHA

For what?

TED

Life.

MARTHA

I don't know.

TED

Are you thinking about what you can do

for work?

51.

MARTHA

No.

TED

You're at an age where you need to start

thinking about a career.

MARTHA

Why?

TED

It's a part of adult life.

MARTHA

There are other ways to live.

TED

Really?

MARTHA

Sure.

TED

Like what?

MARTHA

I don't know. People don't need careers,

people should just exist.

LUCY

He's just saying we should start talking

about what you're interested in. Maybe we

can help you get some ideas together.

TED

I have moments when I would love to move

to France and just exist but it doesn't

work that way.

MARTHA

You can do that if you want to.

TED

It's not that simple.

MARTHA

(CAUTIOUSLY)

It's not your fault but you learned that

success is measured by money and

possessions. It's just not the right way

to live.

52.

TED

And what do you think the right way to

live is? Being a hysterical mess and

causing your family pain. You're eating

my food and sleeping under my roof so

watch your mouth. You're rude.

MARTHA

You don't know anything about it.

WOMAN

Hello...Hello.

MARTHA

Who's this?

WOMAN

Who's this?

(BEAT)

Zoe?

MARTHA

She not there?

WOMAN

She's not.

MARTHA

Where is she?

WOMAN

Who is this?

MARTHA

Who is this?

WOMAN

It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this.

53.

CUT TO:

MAX

Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how

to defend yourselves but I think you're

hopeless.

ZOE

I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows

how to load it.

MAX

Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday.

MAX (CONT'D)

God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes

my willy hard.

ZOE

What happened Doc? I should be teaching

you.

MARTHA

Alright, my turn.

54.

ZOE

(PLAYFUL)

Alright Max, was this just an excuse to

grope Marcy.

MAX

I'm teaching her how to shoot.

Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze.

PATRICK

Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about

someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel

how they made you feel in your stomach.

Take a deep breath, feel it all moving

out into your hands. Let it build. It's

transferring to the gun, building in the

gun. Now release.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

(SMILING)

Feels good right?

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Now try that.

MARTHA

What do you mean?

PATRICK

Shoot it.

MARTHA

They're living animals.

PATRICK

So, shoot Max then.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Go on!

55.

MAX

Fuck this.

PATRICK

Don't walk away from me Max.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

The cat has terminal cancer, it's in

excruciating pain.

MARTHA

I can't.

PATRICK

Max has no substance, he's just here to

free load and be around the girls but

you're a teacher and leader, you just

don't see it because no one let you

believe it before me. You're a leader a

Marcy, now prove it.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing

you think you used to love. You're

holding on to some false emotion that

stops you from doing what's right.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I could spend my life being selfish,

living alone, using this gift for me but

I've sacrificed myself to be what you all

need me to be. You need to trust me.

MARTHA

I trust you.

PATRICK

Then you shouldn't need me to explain

everything.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

What did you do?

56.

MAX

You said it was sick.

PATRICK

One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one

it was!

MARTHA

You okay?

MAX

I'm fine.

(BEAT)

I'll probably leave this place soon

anyways.

MARTHA

Where are you going to go?

MAX

I got places. My cousin lives in

Bennington, he said I could go up there

and make like, $500 a week selling weed.

MARTHA

You don't want to do that.

MAX

I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all

these rules.

MARTHA

Max, they're not rules. It's just common

sense.

MAX

It feels like rules. They won't let me do

anything. I can't even go on the house

runs. I'd be great at taking shit.

MARTHA

It's not about taking shit.

MAX

Sounds like it's about taking shit to me.

57.

MARTHA

And that's why you don't get to come.

You just don't get it.

(BEAT)

You need to quit drinking.

MAX

I'm not drinking.

MARTHA

You're still living with all the shit you

carried out there. You're the only one,

let it go.

MAX

I'll try.

MARTHA

No. You can't try. You have to stop. They

love you, they just want you to be

stronger.

MAX

I'm strong, they'll see.

MARTHA

You'll be okay.

58.

CUT TO:

59.

TED

Jesus Christ you scared me.

MARTHA

Sorry.

TED

Did I wake you?

MARTHA

No. I can't sleep.

TED

Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.

(BEAT)

You want to watch?

MARTHA

I should try to sleep.

TED

It always helps me. It's better than

lying in bed awake.

TED

I'm sorry about before, Martha.

60.

MARTHA

It's alright. It's your house.

TED

You want me to make some breakfast?

TED (CONT'D)

Hey!

TED

What's wrong?

LUCY

You can not be serious right now.

TED

What?

TED (CONT'D)

Lucy!

61.

LUCY

One minute you're going after Martha at

the dinner table, then you're curling up

together on the couch?

TED

No one was curling up with anybody.

LUCY

You really do think I'm stupid don't you?

TED

Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a

movie, she came out and sat down and

started watching with me. What am I

supposed to do, tell her to leave?

TED (CONT'D)

You're being ridiculous.

LUCY

You can lose your temper at will but when

I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or

ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad

for a reason.

TED

Are you accusing me of something? Because

if you are, I'd like you to say it out

loud so you can hear how absurd it

sounds.

LUCY

Fuck you. I just want you to think about

how walking in on that might make me

feel.

TED

You ask me to make more of an effort. I

try to do that and you get upset. I can't

win.

LUCY

You're unbelievable.

62.

CUT TO:

MARTHA

You shouldn't smoke.

LUCY

What? I don't smoke.

63.

MARTHA

Especially if you're trying to have a

kid.

LUCY

Maybe you should mind your own business.

LUCY (CONT'D)

I can't deal with talking to anyone right

now.

MARTHA

What's you name?

BARTENDER

I'm sorry?

64.

MARTHA

What's your name?

BARTENDER

Mike.

BARTENDER (CONT'D)

Can I get you something?

MARTHA

I used to like this.

BARTENDER

Straight?

MARTHA

I thought you weren't supposed to drink

Mike.

BARTENDER

I'm not drinking.

MARTHA

You think you're so fucking smart.

LUCY

Hey, what happenind?

MARTHA

We all need to leave.

LUCY

What?

MARTHA

He's a fucking liar. We all need to

leave.

65.

LUCY

What are you talking about?

MARTHA

We have to leave. We all have to leave. I

know him.

LUCY

Who?

LUCY (CONT'D)

What the fuck is wrong with you?

MARTHA

You don't want to live with this Lucy.

LUCY

Martha.

TED

Calm down.

LUCY

What are you talking about?

MARTHA

They're here.

LUCY

Breath.

MARTHA

Don't touch me, you're not listening to

me!

66.

LUCY

Martha please try to breath. I don't know

what you're talking about.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

MAN

What the fuck.

WATTS

Hey, we can go.

MAN

What do you want?

WATTS

Nothing.

WATTS (CONT'D)

No need for that, we are leaving.

PATRICK

Calm down, if you calm down no one will

get hurt.

MAN

What do you want?

67.

PATRICK

We're not stealing, we don't want

anything.

MAN

Just get out.

PATRICK

We're just looking at the house. It's

nice.

(BEAT)

We didn't realize you were home. We

wouldn't have come in otherwise.

MAN

Just Leave.

PATRICK

I would but I can't be sure you won't

call the police.

MAN

I won't. You didn't take anything so just

go, I just want my family to be safe.

PATRICK

Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless

you call the police, everything will be

fine.

MAN

Okay, I won't. You have my word, please

just go.

MAN (CONT'D)

Get the fuck out of my house.

68.

PATRICK

Look at me.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You okay?

MARTHA

Uh huh.

PATRICK

You know that death is the most beautiful

part of life, right? Death is beautiful

because everyone fears death. And fear is

the greatest human emotion of all because

it creates complete awareness. When

you're scared it forces you to be

completely aware of your surroundings and

the moment you're in. It brings you to

NOW and that makes you truly present. And

when you are truly present, that's

nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is

pure love.

CUT TO:

LUCY

It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.

69.

MARTHA

Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.

LUCY

Everything was fine.

MARTHA

Is it over?

LUCY

Yes, you slept through the night.

MARTHA

That's good.

LUCY

Are you going to drink the tea?

MARTHA

I don't want it.

CUT TO:

MARTHA

We have to do something.

WATTS

He's fine. Right Max?

MAX

Yeah, I'm cool.

MARTHA

Watts!

70.

WATTS

There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to

get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine.

Right?

MAX

Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.

MARTHA

How long do you think we'll be down here?

ZOE

It'll just be a few days. Just to be

safe.

MARTHA

Do you feel alright? If you hit your head

you shouldn't sleep.

MAX

I'm fine.

MARTHA

Do you know why we're down here?

MAX

No. Do you?

MARTHA

What do you think it was?

MAX

I don't know. It doesn't matter.

71.

MARTHA

Do you still think about leaving?

MAX

No. It's cool now, I don't really have

anywhere to go. Why, would you?

MARTHA

No. I just wanted to see about you.

FADE IN:

MARTHA

Hello?

VOICE

Hi, is Watts there?

MARTHA

Who's this?

VOICE

Jane. Is Watts there?

MARTHA

Can I help you?

VOICE

Who's this?

72.

MARTHA

It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name

Jane.

VOICE

Heller, sorry, do I have the right

number?

MARTHA

I don't know, do you?

MARTHA (CONT'D)

It's a Jane.

WATTS

Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do

it, I'll be around there on Friday. No,

that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll

see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad

you called.

WATTS (CONT'D)

Hey.

KATIE

Nothing till they're done. You know

better.

MARTHA

I know. Sorry Katie.

LUCY (O.S.)

Who's Katie?

73.

MARTHA

What?

LUCY

Who's Katie?

MARTHA

Oh, nothing.

MARTHA (CONT'D)

Lucy?

LUCY

Yeah.

MARTHA

Is this from the past or is this now?

LUCY

What?

MARTHA

I don't remember waking up this morning.

LUCY

Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish

up.

TED

What's going on?

LUCY

Who the fuck knows.

TED

She needs to see someone.

74.

LUCY

I know.

TED

I'll start looking into places tomorrow.

We can arrange for her to be somewhere by

Wednesday.

LUCY

Places?

TED

I don't think she should stay with us

anymore. We can't do anything for her

when she's like this.

LUCY

I don't want to talk about it anymore.

CUT TO:

MARTHA

Zoe?

ZOE

Yeah.

MARTHA

I can't stop feeling terrible for that

poor man.

ZOE

I know. It happens though, we're never

really dead or alive, we just exist, so

he's still existing, but it's in a

parallel time. Just don't think about it,

it's in the past.

75.

ZOE

Martha, it's me, can I come in?

PATRICK

Haven't you learned anything?

MARTHA

I have.

PATRICK

I felt like we had a connection.

MARTHA

(DESPERATE)

We do!

PATRICK

That's not what you're showing me.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Maybe I asked too much from you too soon.

You have potential but you're just not

there yet. I'll expect less of you fro

now on.

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

PATRICK

Shhh. It's okay.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You're my favorite, I won't lose you.

CUT TO:

76.

LUCY

Are you alright?

LUCY (CONT'D)

What the fuck happened?

TED

She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus

Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.

LUCY

You could have killed him.

MARTHA

I was confused.

LUCY

About what, what are you so confused

about?

MARTHA

I thought he was someone else.

77.

LUCY

You thought he was someone else? What is

wrong with you?

(BEAT)

I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing

this anymore. I beat myself up over you

for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of

chasing you down and worrying about you.

I need to move on.

MARTHA

I'm sorry.

LUCY

You need help Martha.

MARTHA

I know.

LUCY

What happened to you?

LUCY (CONT'D)

What happened to you?

MARTHA

(SCREAMING)

I don't know.

LUCY

We're going to get you proper help.

MARTHA

Are you going to send me away?

LUCY

I don't know how to help you anymore.

MARTHA

(PLEADING)

Please don't. Please don't.

LUCY

I can't help you.

78.

MARTHA

Please, I can't be alone, please.

LUCY

We're trying to start a family and I

don't trust you to be here.

MARTHA

Lucy?

LUCY

What?

LUCY (CONT'D)

What?

MARTHA

You're going to be a terrible mother.

LUCY

Do you have any money left?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Of course you don't.

(BEAT)

We'll make sure everything is taken care

of.

79.

LUCY

Going swimming?

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

It's a bit chilly.

MARTHA

I don't mind.

LUCY

I think we both said some things last

night that we didn't mean.

MARTHA

Yeah.

LUCY

We scheduled an appointment for you

tomorrow morning.

MARTHA

What's it like there?

LUCY

It looks nice.

LUCY (CONT'D)

We're heading back to the city in about

an hour. You'll be ready to go?

MARTHA

Yep.

80.

TED

Jesus Christ.

LUCY

Are you okay?

TED

Yeah.

LUCY

Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
