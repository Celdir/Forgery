THELMA & LOUISE

"THELMA & LOUISE"

by

Callie Khouri

Final shooting script

JUNE 5, 1990

THELMA

(hollering)

I got it!   Hello.

LOUISE

(at pay phone)

I hope you're packed, little

housewife, 'cause we are outta her

tonight.

THELMA

Well, wait now.  I still have to ask

Darryl if I can go.

LOUISE (V.O.)

You mean you haven't asked him yet?

For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your

husband or your father?  It's just

two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.

Don't be a child.  Just tell him

you're goin' with me, for cryin' out

loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous

breakdown.

THELMA

He already thinks you're out of your

mind, Louise, that don't carry much

weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

LOUISE (V.O.)

No, I'm callin' from the Playboy

Mansion.

THELMA

I'll call you right back.

THELMA

Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry

up.

DARRYL

Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like

that!  Haven't I told you I can't

stand it when you holler in the

morning.

THELMA

I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want

you to be late.

THELMA

Hon.

DARRYL

What.

THELMA

(she decides not to

tell him)

Have a good day at work today.

DARRYL

Uh-huh.

THELMA

Hon?

DARRYL

What?!

THELMA

You want anything special for dinner?

DARRYL

No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what

we have for dinner.  I may not even

make it home for dinner.  You know

how Fridays are.

THELMA

Funny how so many people wanna buy

carpet on a Friday night.  You'd

almost think they's want to forget

about it for the weekend.

DARRYL

Well then, it's a good thing you're

not regional manager and I am.

THELMA

'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.

DARRYL

See ya.

THELMA

He's gonna shit.

ALBERT

Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is

this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you

gonna run away with me?

LOUISE

(to Albert)

Not this weekend, sweetie, she's

runnin' away with me.

(into phone)

Hi.  What'd he say?

THELMA (V.O.)

What time are you gonna pick me up?

LOUISE

You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be

there around two or three.

THELMA (V.O.)

What kind of stuff do I bring?

LOUISE

I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess.

It's the mountains.  I guess it gets

cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring

everything.

THELMA (V.O.)

Okay.  I will, too.

LOUISE

And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

THELMA (V.O.)

I don't know how to fish, Louise.

LOUISE

Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl

does it, how hard can it be?  I'll

see you later.  Be ready.

ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)

Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here

right now, but I'll probably be back

'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave

a message.

THELMA

(muttering to herself)

Psycho killers...

LOUISE

We don't need the lantern.  The place

has electricity.

THELMA

I wanna take it anyway.  Just in

case.

LOUISE

In case of what?

THELMA

In case there's some escaped psycho

killer on the loose, who cuts the

electricity off and tries to come in

and kill us.

LOUISE

(going along with her)

Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern

will come in real handy.  Maybe we

could tow your car behind, in case

he steals the spark plugs.

THELMA

We'd have to.  That thing barely

makes it down the driveway.

THELMA

Louise, will you take care of the

gun?

LOUISE

Why in hell did you bring that?

THELMA

Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers,

bears... snakes!  I just don't know

how to use it.  So will you take

care of it?

THELMA

Whose place is this again?

LOUISE

It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's

gettin' a divorce, so his wife's

gettin' this place, so he's just

lettin' all his friends use it till

he has to turn over the keys.

THELMA

I've never had the chance to go out

of town without Darryl.

LOUISE

How come he let you go?

THELMA

'Cause I didn't ask him.

LOUISE

Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill

you.

THELMA

Well, he has never let me go.  He

never lets me do one goddamn thing

that's any fun.  All he wants me to

do is hang around the house the whole

time while he's out doing God only

knows what.

THELMA

(looking straight

ahead)

I left him a note.  I left him stuff

to microwave.

THELMA

I guess you haven't heard anything

from Jimmy... yet?

THELMA

...never mind.

LOUISE

One of your friends?

THELMA

How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm

hungry.

LOUISE

Another hour of so.  We've got enough

food for a month.

THELMA

I'll never make it... Can't we stop

just for a few minutes...

LOUISE

We've not gonna get to the cabin

till after dark as it is, Thelma.

THELMA

Then what difference does it make if

we stop?  Come on.  I never get to

do stuff like this.

LOUISE

Alright, but it's gonna be a quick

stop.

LOUISE

I haven't seen a place like this

since I left Texas.

THELMA

Isn't this fun?

WAITRESS

Y'all wanna drink?

LOUISE

No thanks.

THELMA

I'll have Wild Turkey straight up

and a Coke back, please.

LOUISE

Thelma!

THELMA

Tell me somethin'.  Is this my

vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God,

you're as bad as Darryl.

LOUISE

I just haven't seen you like this in

a while.  I'm used to seeing you

more sedate.

THELMA

Well, I've had it up to my ass with

sedate!  You said you and me was

gonna get outta town and, for once,

just really let our hair down.  Well,

darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is

comin' down!

LOUISE

(laughing)

Alright...

(to Waitress)

I changed my mind.  I'll have a

margarita with and a shot of Cuervo

on the side, please.

THELMA

Yeah!

MAN

Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls

like you doin' in a place like this?

LOUISE

Mindin' our own

business, why don't

you try it.

THELMA

Well, we left town for the

weekend 'cause we wanted

to try and have a good

time.  And because Louise

here is mad because her

boyfriend won't call her

while he's out on the

road...

THELMA

(quieter)

We just wanted to get somethin' to

eat.

MAN

Well, you come to the right place.

You like chili?  They got good chili.

WAITRESS

Harlan, are you botherin' these poor

girls?

HARLAN (MAN)

Hell, no.  I was just bein' friendly.

WAITRESS

(making eye contact

with Louise)

It's a good thing they're not all as

friendly as you.

THELMA

Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle

named Harlan!

HARLAN

You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause

if he is, then he and I got somethin'

in common.

LOUISE

(to Harlan)

I don't mean to be rude, but I've

got something I need to talk to my

friend about.  In private.

HARLAN

Aw, I understand.  I didn't mean to

bother ya.  It's just hard not to

notice two such pretty ladies as

yourselves.

(standing, to Thelma)

You better dance with me before you

leave, or I'll never forgive you.

THELMA

Oh, sure.  That'd be fun.

THELMA

Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

LOUISE

Can't you tell when somebody's hittin'

on you?

THELMA

So what if he was?  It's all your

years of waitin' tables has made you

jaded, that's all.

LOUISE

Maybe.

THELMA

Well, just relax, will ya.  You're

makin' me nervous.

THELMA

So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

LOUISE

Givin' him a taste of his own

medicine.  Asshole.

THELMA

I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're

all upset.  It's just I'm so excited

to be out of the house, I guess.

(pause)

I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

LOUISE

I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

THELMA

Why don't you tell him to just to

get lost once and for all?

LOUISE

Why don't you ditch that loser husband

of yours?

WAITRESS

(rolling her eyes)

This one's on Harlan.

THELMA

Jimmy'll come in off the road, you

won't be there, he'll freak out and

call you a hundred thousand times,

and Sunday night you'll call him

back and, by Monday.  He'll be kissin'

the ground you walk on.

LOUISE

Exactly.

THELMA

In the meantime, you said we were

gonna have some fun.  So let's have

some!

LOUISE

(over the noise)

Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little

girls' room, and then we gotta hit

the road.

THELMA

(eyes closed, swaying

with the music)

Ready when you are.

THELMA

(eyes still closed)

Louise, I'm gonna come with you.

(she gets a funny

look on her face)

I don't feel so good.

HARLAN

(catching Thelma,

copping feels)

Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you

some fresh air, little lady.

CUT TO:

THELMA

Oh shit.

HARLAN

What's wrong?

THELMA

Stop.

HARLAN

What for?

THELMA

I'm spinning.

HARLAN

How you feelin' now, darlin'?

THELMA

I guess I'm startin' to feel a little

better.

HARLAN

Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty

good to me, too.

THELMA

(uncomfortable)

I think I need to keep walking.

THELMA

Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel

good.  I've been sick.

HARLAN

It's okay.  I'm married, too.

HARLAN

(breathing heavily)

You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I

won't hurt you.  It's okay.

THELMA

(struggling)

Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it!

Louise is gonna wonder where I am.

Let go!

HARLAN

Louise is alright.

HARLAN

Don't you hit me!  Don't you fucking

hit me!

HARLAN

You just shut up.

THELMA

Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.

HARLAN

Shut up.

LOUISE (O.S.)

Let her go.

HARLAN

Get lost.

THELMA

Louise!

LOUISE

You let her go, you fat fucking

asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your

ugly face all over this nice car.

HARLAN

Now, calm down.  We were just havin'

a little fun.

LOUISE

Looks like you've got a real fucked

up idea of fun.  Now turn around.

LOUISE

Just for the future, when a woman's

crying like that, she's not having

any fun!

HARLAN

(pulling up his pants)

Bitch.  I should have gone ahead and

fucked her.

LOUISE

What did you say?

HARLAN

I said suck my cock.

THELMA

Oh my God.

LOUISE

Get the car.

THELMA

Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

LOUISE

Get the car!

LOUISE

(quietly, to herself)

You watch your mouth, buddy.

LOUISE

Get back to the interstate.

THELMA

Shit!  I... I, which way?

LOUISE

West.  Left.

THELMA

Louise.

THELMA

Louise.  Where are we going?

LOUISE

(shaking)

I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know!

Just shut up a minute so I can think.

THELMA

Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean,

I think we should tell the police.

LOUISE

Tell them what?!  What, Thelma?

What do you think we should tell

them?

THELMA

I don't know.  Just tell 'em what

happened.

LOUISE

Which part?

THELMA

All of it.  That he tried to rape

me.

LOUISE

Only about a hundred people saw you

cheek to goddamn cheek with him all

night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe

that?!  We just don't live in that

kind of world.  Pull over!

THELMA

Louise... Are you alright?

LOUISE

Oh Christ.

(to Thelma)

Thelma.

LOUISE

Thelma.

LOUISE

I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've

got to get it together.  I'm gonna

find a place to get a cup of coffee

and I'm gonna sit down for a second.

Do you want to come?

LOUISE

Is that yes?  Are you up to this?

LOUISE

We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you

know what that means?

THELMA

Yes.

LOUISE

It means you don't talk to anybody.

You don't draw attention to yourself

in any way.  Do you understand that?

LOUISE

Tell me you understand that.

LOUISE

(halfway to herself)

We have to think this through.  We

have to be smart.  Now is not the

time to panic.  If we panic now,

we're done for.  Nobody saw it.

Nobody knows it was us.  We're still

okay.  Now all we have to do is just

figure out our next move.

THELMA

Our next move?  I'll say one thing,

Louise.  This is some vacation.  I

sure am having a good time.  This is

real fun.

LOUISE

If you weren't so concerned with

having a good time, we wouldn't be

here right now.

THELMA

Just what is that supposed to mean?

LOUISE

It means shut up, Thelma.

THELMA

So this is all my fault, is it.

LOUISE

Just shut up.

THELMA

I have to go to the bathroom.  I...

Sorry.

HAL

Could you identify 'em, if ya saw

'em again?

LENA (WAITRESS)

Hal, I've told you about twenty times,

yes, I could identify 'em, but neither

one of them was the type to pull

something like this.

HAL

Well, you're not exactly an expert

witness, but what makes you so sure?

LENA

If waitin' tables in a bar don't

make you an expert on human nature,

then nothin' will, and I could've

told you that Harlan Puckett would

end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot.

I'm just surprised it didn't happen

before now.

HAL

Who do you think did it?

LENA

Has anybody asked his wife?  She's

the one I hope did it.

HAL

Lena, just cut the bullshit, will

ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya?

I been standin' in this stupid parkin'

lot all goddamn night, and I still

got to go file a report before I can

go home in time to get back up again!

LENA

Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it

was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's

husband.  But it wasn't either one

of those two.  The tall one, the

redhead, she left me a huge tip.

HAL

You didn't happen to notice what

kind of car they were driving?

LENA

It's a nightclub, not a drive-in,

Hal.  I don't follow the customers

to the parking lot.

HAL

Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might

have to call you in for some more

questioning.

LENA

Those girls are not the murderous

type.

THELMA

(into phone)

Collect from Thelma.

THELMA

Thanks.  I'll try later.

LOUISE

Thelma... Come on, Thelma!

LOUISE

We're gonna go to the next town and

stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I

can rest for a while and then figure

out how to get some money.  We're

gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much

money do you have with you?

THELMA

What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me

look.

THELMA

Sixty-four dollars.

THELMA

Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars.

THELMA

I'm cash poor.

LOUISE

Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.

THELMA

Why are you unpacking?  You said we

were just gonna take a nap.

LOUISE

Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous.

I gotta figure out what to do.

THELMA

Well, when you figure it out, wake

me up.

LOUISE

Just what the hell is wrong with

you?

THELMA

What do you mean?

LOUISE

Why are you actin' like this?

THELMA

Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed

to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing

what to do after you blow somebody's

head off!

LOUISE

You could help me try and figure it

out!  I gotta figure out what to do,

and you could try and help me.

THELMA

I suggested we go to the police, but

you didn't like that; so, frankly,

Louise, I'm all out of ideas.

LOUISE

Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?

If we just give 'em some time, they'll

come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just

not ready to go to jail yet.  Why

don't you go out to the pool or

something and I'll figure it out...

THELMA

Give me the keys.

LOUISE

You're not touchin' that car.

THELMA

My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You

care more about that car than you do

about most people.

LOUISE

Most people just cause me trouble,

but that car always gets me out of

it.

HAL

(pointing)

What's that?

I.D. TECH

Blood?

HAL

Whose?

I.D. TECH

His, I guess...

HAL

You guess?

ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)

Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here

right now...

JIMMY (V.O.)

Hello!  I'm here.  Hang on a minute!

LOUISE (V.O.)

(on phone)

Jimmy...

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

Louise!  Where are you?  Are you

alright?  Honey...

LOUISE

Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long

time no see.

JIMMY (V.O.)

Louise, honey... Where are you?  You

sound funny.

LOUISE

I am funny.  I'm real funny.

JIMMY (V.O.)

Are you in town?  This sounds long

distance.

LOUISE

No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm

in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit

Arkansas.

JIMMY (V.O.)

Louise, just tell me what the hell

is going on here!  I come back, nobody

knows where you are.  Is Thelma with

you?  Darryl's been callin' here

every half-hour sayin' he's gonna

kill you both when you get back,

he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her

if she is.

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

Where'd y'all go?

LOUISE

Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you

to help me.  This is serious.  I'm

in trouble and I need you to help

me.  Can you do that?

JIMMY

Yes, yes, darlin'.  I can help you.

Tell me where you are.

LOUISE

I have a savings account with about

sixty-seven hundred dollars in it.

Now I know you won't be able to get

it out, but I'm good for it.  I need

that money.  Can you wire me the

sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll

pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.

JIMMY (V.O.)

What the fuck is going on?

LOUISE

Something real bad has happened and

I can't tell you what, just that

it's bad and I did it and I can't

undo it.  Can you help me?

JIMMY (V.O.)

Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't

I bring it to you?  For God's sake,

baby, please, just tell me what's

happened, what could possibly be so

bad?

LOUISE

Jimmy?

LOUISE

Do you love me?

JIMMY (V.O.)

Christ, sure... yes!

LOUISE

Wire it to the Western Union in

Oklahoma City,

JIMMY

You're in Oklahoma?!

LOUISE (V.O.)

Not yet.

JIMMY

Louise, let me call you back after I

wire it, so you'll know which office

to go to.

LOUISE (V.O.)

Can't it go to any office?

JIMMY

No, for that much money I have to

tell them exactly which office.  I

know, I've had to have money wired

to me on the road.  And there has to

be a code word or they won't give it

to you.  I'll have to tell you the

code.

LOUISE

Tell me now.

JIMMY (V.O.)

Call me back.

LOUISE

Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an

hour.  Don't tell Darryl.

JIMMY (V.O.)

I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I

love you, okay?

LOUISE

Okay.

LOUISE

(bellowing)

Come on, Thelma!  Get in the car!

THELMA

Did you finish thinking?

LOUISE

I think better when I drive.

HAL

All we know is there were two women

in a green T-Bird convertible that

turned left out of the parking lot,

going real fast.  We're trying to

get a make on the car, but nothin'

yet.  So far, we got nothin'.

MAJOR

Well, you'd best get something.

Even if they didn't do it, it times

out that they most likely witnessed

it.  I want somebody to at least

talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a

description and see what we get back.

HAL

Alright.

MAJOR

Is there any reason to believe they've

left the state?

HAL

That's certainly possible.

MAJOR

Why don't we go ahead and let the

bureau in on this.

HAL

I have no problem with that.

MAJOR

Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.

THELMA

Don't get mad, Louise, but where are

we going?

LOUISE

Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire

me some money, and then...

THELMA

You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did

you tell him?

LOUISE

No, I didn't tell him.  And that's

something we gotta get straight.

Darryl's been callin', mad as a

hornet, makin' all kinds of noise.

When you talk to him, you cannot say

anything about this.  You gotta make

sure everything sounds normal.

THELMA

I called the asshole at 4:00 in the

morning and he wasn't even home.  I

don't know what he's got to be mad

about.  I'm the one who should be

mad.

LOUISE

I've been tellin' you that for the

last ten years.

THELMA

Do you think Darryl's having an

affair?

LOUISE

I don't think Darryl is mature enough

to conduct an affair.

THELMA

But you think he fools around.

LOUISE

Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think

I can make it in two and a half days,

but I'm going to have to haul ass.

Are you up to this?  I mean, I have

to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in

deep shit.  I gotta know what you're

gonna do.

THELMA

I... I don't know.  I don't know

what you're askin' me.

LOUISE

Don't you fall apart on me.

Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we

get in trouble, you go blank or plead

insanity or some such shit, and this

time... Not this time.  Everything's

changed now... Now you can do whatever

you want, but I'm going to Mexico.

I'm going.  Are you coming with me?

THELMA

I think he does.  Fool around.

LOUISE

Do you have a pay phone?

OLD MAN

'Round the side, by the restrooms.

JIMMY

Louise!

LOUISE

Is that how you answer the phone?

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed

you.  I almost couldn't get a check

cashed.  It's Saturday.

LOUISE

Who did it?

JIMMY (V.O.)

Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie

Randall.  You'd know him if you saw

him.  His brother was in your class.

Terry.

LOUISE

You didn't say what it was for, did

you?

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

No, honey.  I told him I was buyin'

a car.  What is it for?

LOUISE

(not responding to

the question)

Good.  That was good.  Where do I

go?

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

It's a place called Shaw's Siesta

Motel.  The address is 1921 North

East 23.  It's under your name.

LOUISE

And what's the mysterious code word?

JIMMY (V.O.)

(on phone)

Peaches.

LOUISE

What?

JIMMY (V.O.)

That's the code word.  I miss you,

peaches.

LOUISE

Okay, Jimmy.  Thanks.

JIMMY

Louise?

OLD MAN

Ma'am, are you sure you wouldn't

rather have the large economy size?

LOUISE

Go call Darryl.

THELMA

Call him?

LOUISE

Call him.  Don't tell him anything.

Tell him you're having a wonderful

time and you'll be home tomorrow

night.

THELMA

Will I be?

LOUISE

I don't know.  I won't be.

THELMA

(into phone)

Collect from Thelma.

THELMA

Honey?

DARRYL

Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam

Hill are you?!

THELMA

I'm... I'm with Louise.  We're in

the mountains, we're...

DARRYL

(interrupting)

What in the hell do you think you're

doing?  Have you lost your goddamn

mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for

work and you take complete leave of

your senses?

THELMA

Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down

now, honey.  Please don't get so

mad.  I can explain...

DARRYL

Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit.

THELMA (V.O.)

...only for one day and we'll be

back tomorrow night.

DARRYL

No you won't.  You'll be back today.

Now!  You get your ass back here,

Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do

you understand me?

THELMA

Darryl, please... You're my husband,

not my father, Darryl.

DARRYL

(interrupting)

That does it!  That Louise is nothin'

but a bad influence.  If you're not

back here tonight, Goddamnit,

Thelma... well, I just don't wanna

say...

DARRYL

Thelma?

THELMA

Darryl.

DARRYL (V.O.)

What?

THELMA

Go fuck yourself.

HITCHHIKER

Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you

alright?

HITCHHIKER

Is there anything I can do?

THELMA

No.  Thanks.  Sorry.

HITCHHIKER

Would you mind me asking which

direction you and your friend are

going?  I'm trying to get back to

school and my ride fell through, so

I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my

way?

THELMA

Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma

City.  But I'm not sure.

HITCHHIKER

Do you think you could... I mean, I

could help pay for gas.

THELMA

Ummm.  Well, see, it's not really up

to me.  It's not my car.  Umm, we'll

have to ask my friend, but she'll

probably say no.  She's a little

uptight.

HITCHHIKER

Well.  Maybe we better not ask her.

But thank you anyway.

THELMA

Well, we can ask her.  That won't

hurt.

THELMA

Louise, this young man is on his way

back to school and needs a ride, and

I thought since...

LOUISE

It's probably not a good idea.

THELMA

Louise.

HITCHHIKER

Y'all have a nice day.  Drive safe.

THELMA

See how polite he is?  He was really

nice.

HITCHHIKER

(to Thelma)

You cheer up now!

CUT TO:

THELMA

I wish we could've brought him with

us.

LOUISE

What did Darryl say?

THELMA

(sarcastically)

He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted

to know you were alright.  I hope

you're havin' a good time.  You sure

deserve one after puttin' up with me

all the time.  I love you, honey."

THELMA

How long before we're in Goddamn

Mexico?

THELMA

I just don't see what it would hurt

just to give somebody a ride.  Did

you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't

have a cute butt.  You could park a

car in the shadow of his ass.

LOUISE

I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood

for company right now.  Here.  Take

this map.  I need you to find all

the secondary roads to Mexico from

Oklahoma City.  I think we should

stay off the interstates.  We're too

conspicuous.

THELMA

(taking map)

Well, it looks like we can get on

this road 81 that heads down towards

Dallas, then cut over to...

LOUISE

(interrupting)

I don't want to go that way.  Find a

way that we don't have to go through

Texas.

THELMA

(looking at map)

Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico

from Oklahoma and you don't want to

go through Texas?

LOUISE

You know how I feel about Texas...

We're not going that way.

THELMA

I know, Louise, but we're running

for our lives!  Don't you think you

could make an exception just this

once?!  I mean, look at the map.

The only thing between Oklahoma and

Mexico is Texas!

LOUISE

Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about

this!  Now find another way or give

me the goddamn map and I will!  You

understand?

THELMA

No, Louise.  How come you never said

what happened?

LOUISE

I... I just... I just don't think

it's the place I wanna get caught

for doin' something like... if you

blow a guy's head off with his pants

down, believe me, Texas is the last

place you wanna get caught!  Trust

me!  Now, I said, I don't wanna talk

about it!!

THELMA

Okay.  We'll go around Texas to get

to Mexico.  This is crazy.

THELMA

I'll tell you what.  He is gooood

lookin'.

THELMA/LOUISE

(pointing)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

THELMA

So J.D., what are you studying in

school?

J.D.

Human nature.  I'm majoring in

behavioral science.

LOUISE

And whaddya wanna be when ya grow

up?

J.D.

A waiter.

DARRYL

What?!

CUT TO:

DARRYL

What?!!

J.D.

(to Thelma)

So how come you don't have any kids?

THELMA

Darryl, that's my husband, he says

he's not ready.  He's still too much

of a kid himself.  He prides himself

on being infantile.

LOUISE

He's got a lot to be proud of.

THELMA

Louise and Darryl don't get along.

LOUISE

That's puttin' it mildly.

THELMA

She thinks he's a pig.

LOUISE

He's a real piece o' work.  I wish

you could meet him.

J.D.

Did you get married real young?

THELMA

Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already

been goin' out with him ten years

when we got married.  I've never

been with anybody but Darryl.

J.D.

Well, if you don't mind me sayin'

so, he sounds like a real asshole.

THELMA

It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most

of the time I just let it slide.

J.D.

Better slow down.  That's a cop.

J.D.

Maybe you got a few too many parking

tickets?

LOUISE

We'll take you on to Oklahoma City,

then you'd best be on your way.

HAL

The prints on the trunk of the car

match those of Thelma Dickinson.

MAX

Well I'll be damned.  Isn't that

strange.

HAL

And the husband says a gun is missing.

She took a lot of stuff.  It looks

like she maybe planned on being gone

a while.  The strange thing is, her

husband said she would never touch

that gun.  He got it for her 'cause

he's out late a lot, but he said

she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn

to shoot it, just left it in a drawer

for years.

MAX

What kind of gun was it?

HAL (V.O.)

A .38.

MAX

Right.  Where are they?

HAL

We're lookin'.  They were on their

way to some guy's cabin and they

never showed up.  We're lookin'.  We

hope you're lookin' too.

LOUISE

I just gotta run in for a minute.

LOUISE

You two better go on and say your

goodbyes.

LOUISE

Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.  Are you

sure?

WOMAN

Nothin'.  Nothin' came in today at

all.

LOUISE

Nothing under peaches?  Check again

under peaches.

WOMAN

Naw, nothin' under peaches neither.

MAN (JIMMY)

Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's

the secret word!  Show her what she's

won, Don.

JIMMY

Hey, peaches.

LOUISE

Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my

God!  What are you doin' here?

JIMMY

(to Woman)

Can we get another room?  Just put

it on my credit card.

WOMAN

'Round to the back.

THELMA

Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in

the world are you doin' here?

JIMMY

Ask me no questions, I'll tell you

no lies.

THELMA

Good answer.  Same goes double for

me.

JIMMY

Who's your friend?

THELMA

This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're

just givin' him a ride to... to here.

Louise said we could bring him here

and then he'd have to go.  And that's

what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't

you, J.D.?

J.D.

Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all

take care.

THELMA

(watching him)

Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to

watch him go.

LOUISE

(to Jimmy)

Thelma kinda took to him.

JIMMY

(to Thelma)

Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.

You can go on in and take a nice

cold shower.

THELMA

Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a

wild woman.

JIMMY

I always knew that.

THELMA

A regular outlaw.

LOUISE

Let me just go in and freshen up for

a minute.  I need to wash my face,

you know.

JIMMY

Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush

you.  I just wanna talk to you and...

(whispering)

...be alone with you.  I'll just be

in my room, 115, you just come on

down when you're ready.

JIMMY

I'll be waiting.

THELMA

I don't care what you say about him.

The boy has got it bad.

LOUISE

He's always got it bad as long as

I'm running in the other direction.

Don't be fooled, he's no different

than any other guy.  He knows how to

chase and that's it.  Once he's caught

you, he don't know what to do.  So

he runs away.

THELMA

I heard that.

LOUISE

(indicating envelope)

Our future.

THELMA

So what are you gonna tell him?

LOUISE

Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a

thing.  The least I can do is not

make him an accessory any more than

he already is.

THELMA

You are so sweet to that guy, you

really are.  Imagine not wanting to

drag him into this.  He is a lucky

man.

LOUISE

I didn't ask him to come!  It's like

I said, Thelma, he just loves the

chase.

THELMA

Well boy, he's got his work cut out

for him now, don't he?

LOUISE

Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard

enough as it is.  Just let me get

this part over with.  Now stay here

and guard the money.  If there's any

problem I'm in room 115.

THELMA

I won't wait up.

LOUISE

How do I look?

THELMA

You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn

vision of loveliness, you always

are.

LOUISE

Have another drink, Thelma.

THELMA

Good idea.

LOUISE

Hello...

JIMMY

(in a falsetto voice)

Who is it?

LOUISE

It's me.

THELMA

Louise?

THELMA

Louise, is that you?

J.D. (O.S.)

(through the door)

Thelma?  It's me.

J.D.

I just thought I... I know I'm

supposed to be gone, but...

J.D.

I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a

ride.

J.D.

Well, I guess I'd better...

THELMA

Wait...!  Um, where ya going?

J.D.

I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are

you doin'?

THELMA

I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a

shower.

J.D.

That sounds nice.

THELMA

Well, you wanna use the shower?

J.D.

Oh.  I... where's Louise?

THELMA

She's off with Jimmy, that's her

boyfriend.

J.D.

That's lonely for you, I guess.  I

always think of motel rooms as lonely.

THELMA

(letting him in the

door)

Oh, yes, well, they can be.

JIMMY

Now, my little coconut, what seems

to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy

everything.

LOUISE

(cringing)

Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it

kind of gives me the creeps when you

do that...

JIMMY

Okay, okay, just tell me what's the

trouble.

LOUISE

Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what

the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll

understand why I can't.  But I won't

tell ya, so don't ask me.

JIMMY

(almost at a loss for

words)

Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask

you one thing?

LOUISE

Maybe.

JIMMY

Does it have something to do with

another guy?  Are you in love with

him?

LOUISE

It's nothin' like that.

JIMMY

(exploding)

Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!

Where the fuck are you going?  Are

you just leaving for fucking ever?

What, did you fuckin' murder somebody

or what?!

LOUISE

Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll

leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!

JIMMY

(calming down)

Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.

JIMMY

Can I just ask you one other thing?

LOUISE

Maybe.

JIMMY

Will you wear this?

JIMMY

Will you at least see how it fits?

LOUISE

Jimmy... it's beautiful!

JIMMY

You didn't see that one comin', did

ya?

THELMA

You wanna drink?

JIMMY

So whaddya think.  I mean... I

could... uh... get a job.  Of some

kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me

that for years, right?

LOUISE

Why now, Jimmy?

JIMMY

(this is hard for him)

'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to

lose you.  And for some reason I get

the feelin' you're about to split.

Permanently.

LOUISE

Jimmy, we've gone all these years...

we never made it work.  We're not

gonna be able to just... I'm not...

What kind of job, honey?  Can you

see it.  I can't.

JIMMY

I'm the one... I never made it work.

I just... It's not that I don't love

you.  It's not that.  I just never

thought I'd be thirty-six years old

and I never thought... I don't know

what I thought.  What do you want,

darlin'.  What do you want me to do.

LOUISE

I don't know.  It doesn't even matter

anymore.  I just want you to be

happy... It's not that I don't love

you either.  But Jimmy, your timing

couldn't be worse.

JIMMY

Are you just doin' this to punish

me?

LOUISE

Believe me, the last thing I want is

for you to get punished.

JIMMY

It does look good.

J.D.

Faster than a speeding green T-Bird,

able to leap tall babes in a single

bound...

J.D.

(in his deep man's

voice)

Hi.  Could I interest you in some

Fuller brushes?

THELMA

(giggling)

Stop, stop, stop!

THELMA

Who are you?

J.D.

I am the great and powerful Oz...

THELMA

J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're

not some schoolboy.  Now come on,

nobody ever tells me shit.

J.D.

I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole

officer is probably having a shit

fit right about now.

THELMA

What?!  Parole officer?  You mean

you're a criminal?

J.D.

Well, not anymore, Thelma, except

for bustin' parole, I haven't done

one wrong thing.

THELMA

What did ya do?

J.D.

I'm a robber.

THELMA

You're a bank robber?

J.D.

Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

THELMA

What?

J.D.

Well, I robbed a gas station once,

and I robbed a couple of liquor

stores, and some convenience stores.

And that's it.

THELMA

How?

J.D.

Well, I was just down on my luck and

it seemed like somethin' I was good

at so I...

THELMA

(interrupting)

No, I mean how would you do it?  Do

you just sneak in real fast or hide

out till the store closes or what?

J.D.

Naw, honey, that would be burglary.

I never got arrested for burglary.

Burglary's for chicken shits.  If

you're gonna rob someone, ya just

have to go right on up to 'em and do

it.  Just take the money.  That's

robbery.  That's a whole 'nother

deal.

THELMA

Tell me.

J.D.

Well, first you pick your place,

see, then I'd just sit back and watch

it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for

just the right moment, which is

something you know instinctively,

that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz

on in...

J.D.

And I'd say, "Alright, ladies and

gentlemen, let's see who'll win the

prize for keepin' their cool.  Simon

says everybody lie down on the floor.

If nobody loses their head, then

nobody loses their head.  You sir...

You do the honors.  Just empty that

cash into this bag and you'll have

an amazing story to tell all your

friends.  If not, you'll have a tag

on your toe.  You decide." Then I'd

split.  Simple.

THELMA

My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about

it.

J.D.

I've always believed if done right,

armed robbery doesn't have to be a

totally unpleasant experience.

THELMA

God.  You're a real live outlaw!

J.D.

I may be the outlaw, but you're the

one stealin' my heart.

THELMA

And smooth, boy, you are smooth.

THELMA

You're kinda the best thing that's

happened to me in a long time.

J.D.

You're a little angle, you are.

JIMMY

Louise?  I think you are so damn

beautiful.  I mean that.  I always

have.

LOUISE

(whispering)

I think you're beautiful too.

JIMMY

Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I

never found you.  I'll say anything

you want.  We'll find a way to get

you out of this, whatever it is.

LOUISE

Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill

that makes you say all the right

stuff?

JIMMY

I'm choking on it.

JIMMY

Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to

come with you?

LOUISE

Oh... now... it's probably not such

a good idea right now.  I'll... catch

up with you later, on down the road.

JIMMY

You keep this!

LOUISE

Your taxi's here.

JIMMY

Are you happy, Louise?  I just want

you to be happy.

LOUISE

I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can

be.

WAITRESS

Good thing he left when he did.  We

thought we were gonna have to put

out a fire.

HAL

Honey?

SARAH

Yes, baby?

HAL

Do you think you could ever shoot

someone?

SARAH

What?

HAL

Do you think you could ever think of

a set of circumstances that would

just cause you to haul off and shoot

someone?

SARAH

I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

HAL

Why?

SARAH

Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

HAL

I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a

stranger?

SARAH

I don't know, honey.  I guess it

would depend.

HAL

On what?

SARAH

(trying to picture it)

Well, maybe if they were trying to

hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm

sure I could shoot someone if they

tried to hurt one of the children.

HAL

Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't

know why I'm even asking you this.

It's just... we can't place anybody

at the scene but these two gals that

everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I

don't know.  I keep hearing words --

impossible -- inconceivable.  If

just one person would say...

SARAH

Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You

just don't shoot someone like that

for no reason.  Maybe he was askin'

for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband

probably got ol' Harlan.

HAL

That's what everybody says.  Only

problem is nobody's husband was

unaccounted for that night... Could

you shoot Eddie in the face?  At

point blank range?

SARAH

(thinking)

In the leg.

HAL

(getting up)

I gotta go to Little Rock.

THELMA

Hi.

LOUISE

What happened to your hair?

THELMA

Nothing.  It got messed up.

LOUISE

What's wrong with you?

THELMA

Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?

LOUISE

Yes, now that you mention it.  You

seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.

THELMA

Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might

be crazy.

LOUISE

(shaking her head)

I don't think I wanna hear what you're

gonna tell me.

THELMA

Oh my God, Louise!!!  I can't believe

it!  I just really can't believe it!

I mean... whoa!

LOUISE

Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

THELMA

I mean I finally understand what all

the fuss is about.   This is just a

whole 'nother ball game!

LOUISE

Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.

You're making a spectacle.

THELMA

You know, Louise, you're supposed to

be my best friend.  You could at

least be a little bit happy for me.

You could at least pretend to be

slightly happy that for once in my

life I have a sexual experience that

isn't completely disgusting.

LOUISE

I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very

happy for you.  I'm glad you had a

good time.  It's about time.  Where

is he now?

THELMA

Taking a shower.

LOUISE

You left that guy alone in the room?

LOUISE

Where's the money, Thelma?

THELMA

Ummm... it's on the table.  It's

okay.

THELMA

I don't remember.

THELMA

Goddamnit!  I've never been lucky!

Not one time!

THELMA

Shit.  That little sonofabitch burgled

me.  I don't believe it.

THELMA

Louise?  Are you okay?

THELMA

Louise... It's okay.  Louise?  I'm

sorry.  I mean it.

LOUISE

It's not okay, Thelma.  It's

definitely not okay.  None of this

is okay.  What are we going to do

for money?  What are we gonna buy

gas with?  Our good looks?  I mean...

Goddamn, Thelma!

THELMA

Come on.  Stand up!  Don't you worry

about it.  I'll take care of it.

Just don't you worry about it.  Get

your stuff.

THELMA

Come on!  Damnit, get your stuff and

let's get out of here!

THELMA

Move!

(to herself)

Jesus Christ, take your damn time.

HAL

(to Darryl)

As you know, we've tapped your phone.

In the event that she calls in.

MAX

We're going to leave someone here at

the house in the event that she calls

in.  Someone will be here until we

find them.

HAL

The important thing is not to let on

that you know anything.  We want to

try and find out where they are.

Now I don't want to get too personal,

but do you have a good relationship

with your wife?  Are you close with

her?

DARRYL

Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as

close as I can be with a nut case

like that.

MAX

Well, if she calls, just be gentle.

Like you're happy to hear from her.

You know, like you really miss her.

Women love that shit.

LOUISE

Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna

make a dent, baby girl.

THELMA

(getting out of the

car)

Don't worry about it.  You want

anything?

LOUISE

No.

THELMA

(breathless)

Drive!

THELMA

Drive!  Drive away!

LOUISE

(driving away)

What happened?

LOUISE

What?  You robbed the store?  You

robbed the Goddamn store?!

THELMA

Well!  We needed the money!  It's

not like I killed anybody, for God's

sake.

THELMA

I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money.

Now we have it.

LOUISE

Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit!

Shit!

THELMA

(sternly)

Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just

drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

LOUISE

Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do?

I mean, what did you say?

THELMA

Well, I just...

THELMA (V.O.)

Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's

see who'll win the prize for keepin'

their cool.  Everybody lie down on

the floor.  If nobody loses their

head, then nobody loses their head...

THELMA (V.O.)

(videotape playback)

You, sir... You do the honors.  Just

empty that cash into this bag and

you'll have an amazing story to tell

all your friends.  If not, you'll

have a tag on your toe.  You decide.

CUT TO:

LOUISE

(incredulous)

Holy shit.

CUT TO:

DARRYL

Jesus Christ.

MAX

Good God.

HAL

(wearily)

My Lord.

LOUISE

Holy shit.

THELMA

Lemme see the map.

FADE TO BLACK

THELMA

Louise, you'd better slow down.

I'll just die if we get caught over

a speeding ticket.

LOUISE

For the first time in my life, I

wish this car wasn't green.

THELMA

Are you sure we should be driving

like this?  In broad daylight and

everything?

LOUISE

No we shouldn't, but I want to put

some distance between us and the

scene of our last Goddamn crime!

THELMA

Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me!

Like I'd been doin' it all my life!

Nobody would ever believe it.

LOUISE

You think you've found your calling?

THELMA

Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

LOUISE

You're disturbed.

THELMA

Yes!  I believe I am!

JIMMY

I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me

one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try

to find that kid that was with 'em.

HAL

Tell us about him.

JIMMY

Just some young guy.  Around twenty

years old.  Dark hair.

JIMMY

(trying to remember

him)

They said they'd picked him up along

the way.  He was a student.  But he

didn't look right.  But he left when

they got to the motel.

MAX

Do you understand that you may be

facing an accessory charge?

HAL

This is serious, son.  A man is dead.

JIMMY

I know!  I'd tell you if I knew!

Goddamn!  I know something happened,

or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying

to remember everything!  Find that

fucking kid.  He probably knows

something.

LOUISE

So what's the plan, Thelma?  You

just gonna stay drunk?

THELMA

Try to.

LOUISE

Litterbug.

LOUISE

Aw, great.  This always happens.

Whenever you're in a hurry.

THELMA

Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are

always so nice.  The best drivers on

the road.

THELMA/LOUISE

Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God!

THELMA

Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?

LOUISE

They think we like it.  Maybe they

think it turns us on.

HAL

Is this the guy you saw them with?

JIMMY

(looking closely)

It's him.

MAX

(clapping his hands)

Oh, happy day.

JIMMY

You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked

up a murderer?!

HAL

Armed robber.

JIMMY

Oh, great.

MAX

(to Hal)

They're flying him here right now.

He was picked up this morning for

parole violation.  They also found

about six grand on him, so he probably

knocked over something while he was

out there.  They can drop him by

here for questioning.  I'm so happy.

JIMMY

(overhearing)

How much cash did he have?

LOUISE

Thelma.

THELMA

Yeah.

LOUISE

I want you to call Darryl.

THELMA

What for?

LOUISE

To find out if he knows anything.

If you think he does, you gotta hang

up because it means the police have

told him and the phone is probably

tapped.

THELMA

Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You

think so?

LOUISE

(agitated)

Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed

robbery, Thelma!

THELMA

Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we

even say it was self-defense?

LOUISE

But it wasn't!  We got away!  We

were walkin' away!

THELMA

They don't know that!  It was just

you and me there.  I'll say he raped

me and you had to shoot him!  I mean,

it's almost the truth!

LOUISE

It won't work.

THELMA

Why not?!

LOUISE

No physical evidence.  We can't prove

he did it.  We probably can't even

prove he touched you by now.

THELMA

God.  The law is some tricky shit,

isn't it?

THELMA

How do you know 'bout all this stuff

anyway?

LOUISE

Besides, what do we say about the

robbery?  No excuse for that.  No

such thing as justifiable robbery.

THELMA

Alright, Louise!

DARRYL

(yelling at the door)

Hey!  Hey!

J.D.

Who's the nut?

HAL

That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.

J.D.

Aw, God.

J.D.

(pleased)

Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?

HAL

Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight

better 'n you right now.

MAX

Where did you get $6600.00 in cash?

J.D.

A friend.

HAL

We spoke with a gentlemen today who

says he personally delivered very

close to that same amount to a Miss

Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?

J.D.

Umm, yes.  She was driving.

HAL

He said he took it to a motel in

Oklahoma City.  He also says that at

that time he met a man.  He identified

you through a series of mug shots.

He also told us that you and Mrs.

Dickinson seemed "close." Is that

true?

J.D.

You might say we had a meeting of

the minds, yes.

MAX

Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and

Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection

with a murder?

J.D.

What?!

HAL

Did either of them ever indicate

that they might be running from the

Law?

J.D.

(surprised to hear

this)

Now that you mention it, they might

have been a little bit jumpy.

HAL

You know what?  You're starting to

irritate me.

MAX

Yeah.  Me too.

HAL

Do you mind if I have a word with

him alone for a minute.

J.D.

What?!  What'd I do?

HAL

Son, I gotta feelin' about somethin'

and I just wanna ask your opinion.

Do you think Thelma Dickinson would

have committed armed robbery if you

hadn't taken all their money?

HAL

Cat got your tongue?

J.D.

How do you know I took it?  How do

you know they didn't just give it to

me?

HAL

There's two girls out there that had

a chance, they had a chance...!  And

you blew it for 'em.  Now they've

gotten in some serious trouble, some

very serious trouble and for at least

part of it, I'm gonna hold you

personally responsible for anything

that happens to them.  I've got no

feelin' for you.  But I may be the

only person in the world who gives a

rat's ass what happens to them and

you're either gonna tell me every

damn thing you know, so there's a

small chance I can actually do them

some good, or I'm gonna be all over

you like a fly on shit for the rest

of your natural life.  Your misery

is gonna be my goddamn mission in

life.  That's a sincere promise.

HAL

Now, for one thing, you violated

your parole two days out.  And you

know Judge Hainey.  He hates this

sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of

this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And

then when he finds out that you're a

possible accessory to murder and

armed robbery, well, I think we can

safely place your ass back in the

slammer for at least the remaining

eight, don't you?

MAX

Oh, definitely.

J.D.

(convinced)

Okay.  Is somebody gonna write this

down?

HAL

Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang

on, I want a word with you and then

we'll take you home.

J.D.

(slyly, to Darryl)

I like your wife.

DARRYL

(going after him)

Come back here, you little shit!

LOUISE

(to attendant)

Fill her up.

(to Thelma)

There's a phone right over there.

THELMA

Let's get it over with.

LOUISE

I'm not kidding, Thelma.  If you

think he knows, even if you're not

sure, hang up.

DARRYL

Hello.

THELMA

Darryl.  It's me.

DARRYL

(real friendly)

Thelma!  Hello!

THELMA

(matter-of-factly)

He knows.

HAL

Shit.

DARRYL

What?!  All I said was hello.

LOUISE

You got any change?

LOUISE

Darryl, this is Louise.  Are the

police there?

DARRYL

Uh, no!  No, why would any police be

here?  Hey, where are you girls,

anyway?

LOUISE

Let me talk to whoever's in charge

there?

DARRYL

What are you talking about, Louise?

HAL

Hello, Miss Sawyer.  I'm Hal Slocumbe,

Chief Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas

State Police.  How are you?

LOUISE

(chuckling)

I've been better.

HAL (V.O.)

You girls are in some hot water.

LOUISE

Yes, sir.  I know.

HAL

You're both okay?  Neither one of

you hurt?  You're bein' careful with

that gun?

LOUISE

We're both fine.

HAL (V.O.)

Good.  You wanna tell me what

happened?

LOUISE

Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime.

I'll buy.

HAL

I just want you to know, neither one

of you are charged with murder yet.

You're still just wanted for

questioning.  Although, now, Mrs.

Dickinson's wanted in Oklahoma for

armed robbery.

LOUISE

No kiddin'.  Listen, we gotta go.

I'll call you back, all right?

HAL (V.O.)

Miss Sawyer, I don't think y'all are

gonna make it to Mexico.  We should

talk.  Please.  I wanna to help you.

LOUISE

That J.D. kid is a little shit.

THELMA

What.

LOUISE

How'd they find out we're going to

Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?

THELMA

I... I...

LOUISE

You told that thievin' little shit

where we were goin'?!

THELMA

I just told him if he ever gets to

Mexico to look us up.  I asked him

not to tell.  I didn't think he would

tell anybody.

LOUISE

Why not?!  What's he got to lose?

Other than my life's savings, that

is.  Shit!

THELMA

I'm sorry.  I mean I...

LOUISE

Goddamnit, Thelma!  Let me explain

something to you.  Right now we have

only two things goin' for us.  One,

nobody knows where we are, and two,

nobody knows where we're going.

Now, one of our things that was going

for us is gone!

LOUISE

Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!

Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives

now.  Let's behave that way!

THELMA

You're right.

THELMA (V.O.)

Louise?  Where are we?

LOUISE (V.O.)

Just past Boise City.

THELMA (V.O.)

Idaho?

LOUISE (V.O.)

Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing

into New Mexico.

THELMA (V.O.)

I always wanted to see New Mexico.

THELMA

Now what?

LOUISE

Now what what?

THELMA

Whaddo we do?

LOUISE

Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess

maybe we could turn ourselves in and

spend our lives trading cigarettes

for mascara so we can look nice when

our families come to visit us on

Saturdays.  Maybe we could have

children with the prison guards.

THELMA

I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not

goin' back.  No matter what happens.

So don't worry about me.

THELMA

Can I ask you kind of a weird

question?

LOUISE

Yeah.

THELMA

Of all the things in the world that

scare you, what's the worst thing

that scares you the most?

LOUISE

You mean now or before?

THELMA

Before.

LOUISE

I guess I always thought the worst

thing that could happen would be to

end up old and alone in some crummy

apartment with one of those little

dogs.

THELMA

What little dogs?

LOUISE

You know those little dogs you see

people with?

THELMA

Like a Chihuahua?

LOUISE

Those, too, but you know those little

hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little

fuckers with those ugly goddamned

teeth?

THELMA

Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.

LOUISE

Yeah.  Those.  That always put the

fear of God in me.  What about you?

THELMA

Well, to be honest, the idea of

getting old with Darryl was kinda

startin' to get to me.

LOUISE

I can see that.

THELMA

I mean, look how different he looks

just since high school.  It's bad

enough I have to get old, but doin'

it with Darryl around is only gonna

make it worse.

(quieter)

I mean, I don't think he's gonna be

very nice about it.

LOUISE

Well, now, maybe you won't have to.

THELMA

Always lookin' on the bright side,

aren't ya?

THELMA

This is so beautiful.

LOUISE

Gosh.  It sure is.

THELMA

I always wanted to travel.  I just

never got the opportunity.

LOUISE

Well, you got it now.

LOUISE

Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll

be darned.  What's he doin' way out

here.

THELMA

Just ignore him.

LOUISE

Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.

THELMA

We should have just ignored him.

LOUISE

What?

THELMA

(shaking with laughter)

Nothing.  It's not funny.

LOUISE

What?  What's not funny, Thelma!

THELMA

Okay, but...

(she can barely speak)

I can't say.

LOUISE

What?!

THELMA

(gasping for air)

Harlan.

LOUISE

What?!  What about him?!

THELMA

Just the look on his face when you...

(she is falling apart

again)

...it's not funny.

LOUISE

(shocked)

Now, Thelma, that is not...

THELMA

Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!

LOUISE

(scolding)

Thelma!

THELMA

(impersonating Harlan)

Suck my dick... Boom!!

LOUISE

(quietly)

Thelma.  It's not funny.

THELMA

(trying to catch her

breath)

I know!

THELMA

(carefully)

It happened to you... didn't it?

LOUISE

I don't want to talk about it!

Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you

even...

THELMA

...in Texas... didn't it?  That's

what happened... Oh my God.

LOUISE

(fighting hysteria)

I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better

drop it right now!  I don't want to

talk about it!

THELMA

(gently)

Okay, Louise... It's okay.

LOUISE

Shit!  Thelma, wake up!  Shit!  We're

gettin' pulled over!

THELMA

What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no!

THELMA

What do we do?  What do you want to

do?!

LOUISE

I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just

play it by ear.  He may not know.

He may just give me a ticket.

THELMA

Please, God, please don't let us get

caught.  Please, please, please...

PATROLMAN (O.S.)

Turn off your engine.

LOUISE

Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

PATROLMAN

You wanna let me see your license,

please?

PATROLMAN

You wanna take it out of your wallet,

please?

LOUISE

Oh yeah.

THELMA

I told you to slow down.  Hell,

Officer, I told her to slow down.

LOUISE

About how fast was I going?

PATROLMAN

About a hundred and ten.  You wanna

step out of the car, please?

PATROLMAN

Is this your car?

LOUISE

Yes.

PATROLMAN

You wanna come with me, please?

Walk around and get in the car,

please.

LOUISE

In the back?

PATROLMAN

Front.

LOUISE

Am I in trouble?

PATROLMAN

As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am,

you are.

THELMA

Officer, I am so sorry about this.

Could you let go of that?

THELMA

I really, really apologize, but please

put your hands on the steering wheel.

See, if you get on that radio, you're

gonna find out that we're wanted in

two states and probably considered

armed and dangerous, at least I am,

then our whole plan would be shot to

hell.  Louise, take his gun.

LOUISE

(apologetic)

I am really sorry about this.

THELMA

I swear, before yesterday, neither

one of us would have ever pulled a

stunt like this.  But if you ever

met my husband, you'd know why I

just can... You wanna step out of

the car, please?

(she opens the door

for him)

You wanna put your hands on your

head, please?  Louise, shoot the

radio.

LOUISE

What?

THELMA

Shoot the radio!

THELMA

The police radio, Louise!  Jesus!

THELMA

You wanna step to the back of the

car, please.  Louise, bring the keys.

THELMA

(to Louise)

Open the trunk.

THELMA

(to Patrolman)

You wanna step into the trunk, please?

PATROLMAN

Ma'am, please... I got kids... a

wife...

THELMA

You do?  Well, you're lucky.  You be

sweet to 'em.  Especially your wife.

My husband wasn't sweet to me and

look how I turned out.  Now go on,

get in there.

THELMA

Air holes.

THELMA

(to trunk)

Sorry!

LOUISE

(from her car)

Sorry!

LOUISE

Ready?

THELMA

Hit it.

THELMA

(shaking her head)

I know it's crazy, Louise, but I

just feel like I've got a knack for

this shit.

LOUISE

I believe you.

THELMA (V.O.)

Drive like hell.

MAX

It's just not working like this.  We

gotta do something.  It'd be one

thing if these girls were hardened

criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is

makin' us look bad.  I don't know...

maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe

that little creep lied.

HAL

He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.

Nothin' at all.  He already got all

their money.  I just don't know what

we're dealin' with here.  Anyway, it

went out again last night on

Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just

wait it out a little longer.  She

said she was gonna call back.  Let's

just sit tight.

MAX

We don't have a whole lotta choice,

do we?  I can't figure out if they're

real smart or just really, really

lucky.

HAL

It don't matter.  Brains will only

get you so far and luck always runs

out.

THELMA

Louise... are we still going to

Mexico?

LOUISE

Yes.

THELMA

Then aren't we going in the wrong

direction?

LOUISE

Well, I figure if you take a state

policeman, shoot up his car, take

his gun and lock him in the trunk,

it's best to just get on out of the

state if you can.

THELMA

Just asking.

LOUISE

I don't want to see any more beef

jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky

you hand me is going out the window.

It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole

car smells like it.

THELMA

It's good.  It's what the pioneers

ate.

LOUISE

I don't care what the damn pioneers

ate.  You just keep that shit away

from me, now I mean it.

LOUISE

And I don't want any more Wild Turkey,

either.  It's burning a hole in my

stomach.

THELMA

Okay, okay... I've got some tequila.

You want some tequila?

LOUISE

You do?

THELMA

Yeah, you want it?

LOUISE

Yeah.

THELMA

It's in here somewhere.

LOUISE

Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.

THELMA

Are you alright?

LOUISE

I think I've really fucked up.  I

think I've got us in a situation

where we could both get killed.  Why

didn't we just go straight to the

police.

THELMA

You know why.  You already said.

LOUISE

What'd I say again?

THELMA

Nobody would believe us.  We'd still

get in trouble.  We'd still have our

lives ruined.  And you know what

else?

LOUISE

What?

THELMA

That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you

hadn't come out when you did, he'd a

hurt me a lot worse.  And probably

nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause

everybody did see me dancin' with

him all night.  And they woulda made

out like I asked for it.  And my

life woulda been ruined a whole lot

worse than it is now.  At least now

I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry

the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm

only sorry that it was you that did

it and not me.  And if I haven't, I

wanna take this time to thank you,

Louise.  Thank you for savin' my

ass.

LOUISE

I said all that?

THELMA

No, Louise, you said the first part.

I said all the rest.

LOUISE

(tired)

Whatever.

MAX

Hello.

LOUISE (V.O.)

Let me speak to... Slocumbe.

MAX

(to Hal)

She wants to talk to you.

HAL

Hello, Louise.

LOUISE

Hey.

HAL (V.O.)

How are things goin' out there?

LOUISE

Weird.  Got some kind of snowball

effect goin' here or somethin'.

HAL (V.O.)

You're still with us though.  You're

somewhere on the face of the earth?

LOUISE

Well, we're not in the middle of

nowhere, but we can see it from here.

HAL

I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like

I know you.

LOUISE (V.O.)

Well.  You don't.

HAL

You're gettin' in deeper every moment

you're gone.

LOUISE (V.O.)

Would you believe me if I told you

this whole thing is an accident?

HAL

I do believe you.  That's what I

want everybody to believe.  Trouble

is, it doesn't look like an accident

and you're not here to tell me about

it... I need you to help me here.

HAL (V.O.)

Did Harlan Puckett...

LOUISE

(interrupting)

No!

HAL (V.O.)

You want to come on in?

LOUISE

I don't think so.

HAL

Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to

charge you with murder.  Now, do you

want to come out of this alive?

LOUISE

You know, certain words and phrases

just keep floating through my mind,

things like incarceration, cavity

search, life imprisonment, death by

electrocution, that sort of thing.

So, come out alive?  I don't know.

Let us think about that.

HAL (V.O.)

Louise, I'll do anything.  I know

what's makin' you run.  I know what

happened to you in Texas.

THELMA

Come on, Louise.  Don't blow it.

Let's go.

THELMA

Come on.

HAL

Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm...

I'm the only one she's ever talked

to.  I don't want anybody losin'

their heads.  You know what happens.

The volume gets turned way up and

the next thing you know those girls

are gonna get shot.

MAX

(calmly)

Okay, Hal, okay.

THELMA

Louise?

LOUISE

Yes, Thelma?

THELMA

You're not gonna give up on me, are

ya?

LOUISE

What do you mean?

THELMA

You're not gonna make some deal with

that guy, are you?  I mean, I just

wanna know.

LOUISE

No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any

deals.

THELMA

I can understand if you're thinkin'

about it.  I mean, in a way, you've

got something to go back for.  I

mean Jimmy and everything.

LOUISE

Thelma, that is not an option.

THELMA

But I don't know... something's

crossed over in me and I can't go

back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

LOUISE

I know.  I know what you mean.  I

don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo

Show.

LOUISE

He said they're charging us with

murder.

THELMA

(making a face)

Eeuww.

LOUISE

And we have to decide whether we

want to come out of this dead or

alive.

THELMA

Gosh, didn't he say anything positive

at all?

THELMA

Louise, do you think we should change

cars, get another car?

LOUISE

Sure... You know how to hotwire a

car?

THELMA

No.

LOUISE

Well, let me know when you figure it

out.

THELMA

You awake?

LOUISE

You could call it that.  My eyes are

open.

THELMA

Me too.  I feel awake.

LOUISE

Good.

THELMA

Wide awake.  I don't remember ever

feelin' this awake.  Everything looks

different.  You know what I mean.  I

know you know what I mean.  Everything

looks new.  Do you feel like that?

Like you've got something to look

forward to?

LOUISE

We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the

sea, Mamasita.

THELMA

We can change our names.

LOUISE

We can live in a hacienda.

THELMA

I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at

Club Med.

LOUISE

Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do

you think that cop can come up with

to beat that?

THELMA

It'd have to be pretty good.

LOUISE

It would have to be pretty damn good.

LOUISE

We should head a little further in.

There's not that many roads in this

state.  I want to try to hit Mexico

somewhere not so close to New Mexico.

They probably wanna kill us in New

Mexico.

THELMA

You're drivin'.

THELMA

(screaming over music)

Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look!

See if that's him!

LOUISE

It's him.  He's got California plates.

It's the same guy.

THELMA

Pass him!

THELMA

Hi!

TRUCKER

Hi there!  You alright?

THELMA

We're fine!  How are you?

TRUCKER

Grrrreat!

LOUISE

Follow us.

THELMA

Where you goin'?

TRUCKER

Fresno.

LOUISE

We been seein' you all along the

way.

TRUCKER

Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.

THELMA

We think you have really bad manners.

LOUISE

We were just wonderin' where you

think you get off behavin' like that

to women you don't even know.

TRUCKER

What?  What are you talkin' about?

LOUISE

You know good and damn well what I'm

talkin' about.

THELMA

I mean really!  That business with

your tongue.  What is that?  That's

disgusting!

LOUISE

And, oh my God, that other thing,

that pointing to your lap?  What's

that supposed to mean exactly?  Does

that mean pull over, I want to show

you what a big fat slob I am or...

THELMA

Does that mean suck my dick?

TRUCKER

You women are crazy!

LOUISE

You got that right.

THELMA

We think you should apologize.

TRUCKER

I'm not apologizing for shit!

LOUISE

Say you're sorry.

TRUCKER

Fuck that.

LOUISE

Say you're sorry or we'll make you

fuckin' sorry.

TRUCKER

Oh, Jesus!

THELMA

You probably even called us beavers

on your CB radio, didn't you?

TRUCKER

Yeah... sure did.

THELMA

Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein'

called a beaver, don't you?

LOUISE

Are you going to apologize or not?

TRUCKER

Fuck you.

TRUCKER

Oh goddamn!!  You bitch!!

TRUCKER

You fucking bitch!  Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!

You're gonna have to pay for that!!!

I'm gonna make you pay for that!!

You hear me??!!

THELMA

Shut up.

THELMA

Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot

like that?

LOUISE

Texas... You were right about what

happened to me there.

LOUISE (V.O.)

You know what's happened, don't you?

THELMA (V.O.)

What?

LOUISE (V.O.)

(smiling)

We've gone insane.

THELMA (V.O.)

Yup.

POLICE (V.O.)

(on phone)

...Abducted... shot up the car...

stole the officer's weapon...

tanker... blown up... terrorized...

MAX

You're not even going to believe

this.

THELMA

Oh shit.  Louise... Do you think he

saw us?

LOUISE

I don't know, but let's get off.

LOUISE

Is your seat belt on?

THELMA

I guess we shoulda made some kinda

plan for what to do if we get caught.

LOUISE

Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get

caught.

POLICEMAN #1

...requesting assistance.  In pursuit

of a green T-Bird, 1966 license,

seven, one, nine, William, Zebra,

Adam...

RADIO (V.O.)

Roger.  Be advised...

(breaks up)

...armed and extremely dangerous...

THELMA

How far are we from Mexico?

LOUISE

About two hundred and fifty miles.

THELMA

How long do you think that'll take?

THELMA

We're going to Mexico!

THELMA

(looking back)

Uh oh.  There's another one.

LOUISE

Shit!

THELMA

Did you see that guy?!  He was right

in the middle of the road!

LOUISE

(looking in rearview

mirror)

Shit!

THELMA

What?!

LOUISE

What?!  What d'you think?!

THELMA

Oh.

LOUISE

We probably shoulda filled up the

car before we blew up that truck.

THELMA

Why?

LOUISE

They'll probably catch us when we

have to stop for gas!

THELMA

I know this whole thing was my fault.

I know it is.

LOUISE

There's one thing you oughta

understand by now, Thelma, it's not

your fault.

THELMA

Louise... no matter what happens,

I'm glad I came with you.

LOUISE

You're crazy.

THELMA

You're a good friend.

LOUISE

You too, sweetie, the best.

THELMA

I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

LOUISE

No... You've always been crazy.

This is just the first chance you've

had to really express yourself.

THELMA

I guess everything from here on in

is going to be pretty shitty.

LOUISE

Unbearable, I'd imagine.

THELMA

I guess everything we've got to lose

is already gone anyway.

LOUISE

How do you stay so positive?

THELMA

Louise!

LOUISE

What?!

THELMA

What in the hell is that up there?

LOUISE

Where?!

THELMA

Way up ahead!

LOUISE

Oh my God!!

THELMA

What in the hell is it?!

LOUISE

It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!

THELMA

Isn't it beautiful?!!

LOUISE

It's grand!

THELMA

God!  It looks like the Army!

LOUISE

All this for us?

HAL

Hey!  Don't let them shoot those

girls.  This is too much.  They got

guns pointed at 'em!

MAX

The women are armed, Hal.  This is

standard.  Now you stay calm here.

These boys know what they're doin'.

POLICE (O.S.)

(over loudspeaker)

This is the Arizona Highway Patrol.

You are under arrest.  You are

considered armed and dangerous.  Any

failure to obey any command will be

considered an act of aggression

against us.

THELMA

Now what?

LOUISE

We're not giving up, Thelma.

THELMA

Then let's not get caught.

LOUISE

What are you talkin' about?

THELMA

(indicating the Grand

Canyon)

Go.

LOUISE

Go?

THELMA

Go.

ARIZONA COP #1

...heard they shot a cop.

ARIZONA COP #2

No shit.

ARIZONA COP #1

With his own gun.  Put him in the

trunk and blew him away...

POLICE (O.S.)

(over loudspeaker)

Turn off the engine and place your

hands in the air!

HAL

Max!  Let me talk to 'em!  I can't

believe this!  You've gotta do

something here!

HAL

I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're

real busy right now, but how many

times, Max?  How many times has that

woman gotta be fucked over?  You

could lift one finger and save her

ass and you won't even do that?

MAX

(grabbing Hal)

Get a hold of yourself!  You are way

out of your jurisdiction, now come

on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry

I let you come!

HAL

(under his breath)

Shit!  I can't fucking believe this!

MAX

(shouting)

Hey.  Hey!

ARIZONA COP #1

What in the hell?!

ARIZONA #2

(lowering his rifle)

The son of a bitch is in my way!

THELMA

You're a good friend.

LOUISE

You, too, sweetie, the best.

LOUISE

Are you sure?

THELMA

Hit it.

CUT TO:

B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)

I've been around, I've seem some

things, People movin' faster than

the speed of sound, faster than a

speedin' bullet.  People livin' like

Superman, all day and all night.  I

won't say if it's wrong or I won't

say if it's right.  I'm pretty fast

myself.  But I do have some advice

to pass along, right here in the

words to this song...

B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)

Better not look down, if you wanna

keep on flyin'.  Put the hammer down,

keep it full speed ahead.  Better

not look back or you might just wind

up cryin'.  You can keep it movin'

if you don't look down...

FADE OUT

THE END
