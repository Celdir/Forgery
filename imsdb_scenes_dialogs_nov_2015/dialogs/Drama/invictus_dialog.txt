NELSON MANDELA

HIGH SCHOOL BOY

Who is it, sir?

COACH

It's that terrorist, Mandela. They

let him out.

(BEAT)

Remember this day, boys. It's the

day our country went to the dogs.

RIGHT WINGERS

FAMOUS WORDS:

"Never, never and never again shall it be

that this beautiful land will again

experience the oppression of one by another,

and suffer the indignity of being the skunk

GO TO BLACK:

3.

LINGA

Here he comes. Like clockwork.

JASON

It makes him such an easy target.

4.

JASON

(traditional greeting in

XHOSA)

I see you, father.

MANDELA

(without breaking stride)

Morning boys. How are you?

JASON

We're sharp, Madiba.

MANDELA

Good ... good. And how's your

mother doing, Linga?

LINGA

She's much better, thank you.

MANDELA

Good.

JASON

What does it say?

MANDELA

It says, "He can win an election,

but can he run a country?"

LINGA

(DISGUSTED)

Not even one day on the job and

they're after you.

MANDELA

It's a legitimate question.

CUT TO:

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Today marks the beginning of a new

era in South Africa --

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

-- as President Mandela takes

office in Pretoria, facing issues

that range from economic stagnation

and unemployment to rising crime --

8.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

-- while at the same time balancing

black aspirations --

CUT TO:

TV ANNOUNCER

-- with white fears.

MR. PIENAAR

(GLOOMY)

I never thought I'd see the day.

MR. PIENAAR

I feel sorry for you, son. You've

got your whole life ahead of you.

What's it going to be like now?

MRS. PIENAAR

Don't be so gloomy.

(handing over shake)

I added vitamins -- there's a

horrible flu bug going around.

Tell Nerine when you get home.

PIENAAR

Thanks, ma.

MR. PIENAAR

I'm telling you, Francois -- look

at Angola, look at Mozambique.

Look at Zimbabwe. We're next.

They're going to take our jobs and

drive us into the sea. Just you

wait.

CUT TO:

9.

JASON

(with great pride)

After you, Mr. President.

10.

MANDELA

Good morning everybody.

ALL

(GREETINGS)

MANDELA

Barbara, good morning. You've had

your hair done. I like it.

BARBARA

Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk

about your cabinet appointments and

ministers.

MANDELA

Give me one moment, please.

11.

MANDELA

BARBARA --

MANDELA

-- please assemble the staff for

me. Whoever has not already left.

BARBARA

Right now? All of them?

MANDELA

Yes, please.

CUT TO:

STAFF MEMBER#1

Here he comes.

STAFF MEMBER#2

He wants the satisfaction of firing

us himself.

MANDELA

I'd like you to stay out here,

please.

JASON

But, Madiba ...

12.

MANDELA

I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding

behind men with guns.

MANDELA

(IN AFRIKAANS)

Gooie more almal.

STAFF MEMBER

(ASIDE)

Does he think greeting us in

Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?

MANDELA

Some of you may know who I am.

MANDELA

Good morning ... how are you ...

thank you for coming at such short

notice ... etc.

QUICK CUT TO:

BACK TO:

MANDELA

I couldn't help noticing the empty

offices as I came to work today.

And all the packing boxes.

13.

MANDELA

Now, of course, if you want to

leave, that is your right. And if

you feel in your heart that you

cannot work with your new

government, then it is better that

you do leave, right away.

MANDELA

But if you are packing up because

you fear that your language, or the

color of your skin, or who you

served previously, disqualifies you

from working here now, I am here to

tell you, have no such fear.

(BEAT)

Wat is verby is verby. What's past

is past. We look to the future,

now.

MANDELA

We need your help. We want your

help. If you would like to stay,

you will be doing your country a

great service.

MANDELA

I ask only that you do your jobs to

the best of your abilities, and

with good hearts. I promise to do

the same.

(BEAT)

If we can manage that, our country

will be a shining light in the

world.

CUT TO:

JASON

He wants to win them over, one damn

boer at a time.

CUT TO:

14.

JASON

Molo, sister.

JESSIE

(FRAZZLED)

It's still morning?

JASON

When you get a chance, can we see

the schedule for the month? We

need to plan security.

JESSIE

(ANSWERING PHONE)

Office of the President, good

morning.

JASON

We need more men.

LINGA

Did you talk to Barbara about it?

JASON

Yesterday.

15.

JASON

That's Jessie, with the schedule.

(LOUDLY)

Come in, beautiful.

JASON

What is this?

ETIENNE

Mr. Jason Tshabalala?

JASON

That's me. Am I under arrest?

ETIENNE

Captain Van Eck and team reporting

for duty, sir.

JASON

What duty?

ETIENNE

We're the Presidential bodyguard.

We've been assigned to this office.

(holding out a sheet of

PAPER)

Here are our orders.

LINGA

(TO HENDRICK)

You're Special Branch, right?

16.

ETIENNE

You'll see that they've been

signed.

JASON

I don't care if they're signed or --

JASON

Wait here.

JASON

Sorry to disturb you.

MANDELA

You look agitated, Jason.

JASON

That's because I've got four

Special Branch cops in my office.

MANDELA

What have you done?

JASON

Me? Nothing. They say they're the

Presidential bodyguard. They have

orders.

(BEAT)

Signed by you.

MANDELA

Yes. They've had special training,

those boys -- with the SAS. And

lots of experience. They protected

De Klerk.

17.

JASON

Yes, but --

MANDELA

You asked for more men, didn't you?

JASON

Yes, but --

MANDELA

In public, when people see me, they

see my bodyguards, too. You

represent me, directly. The

rainbow nation starts here.

(BEAT)

Reconciliation starts here.

JASON

Reconciliation? Madiba, not long

ago they tried to kill us! Maybe

even these four guys. They tried

and, often, they succeeded!

CUT TO:

BACK TO:

MANDELA

Yes, I know.

(VERY GENTLY)

Forgiveness starts here, too.

MANDELA

Forgiveness liberates the soul. It

removes fear. That is why it is

such a powerful weapon, Jason.

(MORE)

18.

MANDELA (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

Please try it.

JASON

Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you.

BARBARA

You ask a lot.

MANDELA

Only what is necessary.

CUT TO:

JESSIE

Two copies of the schedule.

JESSIE

Thank you, Jessie!

LINGA

Can we get rid of these guys, now?

19.

JASON

This is his schedule for the next

month. Let's look it over for duty

assignments.

ETIENNE

Right.

LINGA

What?

LINGA

Jason, I have to talk to you.

Outside.

LINGA

How can we trust them?

JASON

We can't.

(heading back in)

This is what Madiba wants, okay.

ETIENNE

Are there any special orders or

conditions?

JASON

No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you

don't smile when you push people

out of the way.

HENDRICK

Seriously?

20.

LINGA

Yes, seriously. It's the new South

Africa.

ETIENNE

Madiba?

JASON

The President's clan name. It's

what we call him.

ETIENNE

We'll call him Mr. President.

JASON

Let's get through this.

ETIENNE

How's he going to do all this?

When does he take a break?

LINGA

He says he rested enough in prison.

JASON

Here's a headache.

LINGA

What?

21.

JASON

A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld.

British Lions against the

Springboks.

HENDRICK

It's going to be a headache for the

Lions, that's for sure. We're

going to donder them.

JASON

I don't care about the game. I

care that the President'll be so

exposed.

LINGA

To thousands of drunken --

ETIENNE

(INNOCENTLY)

-- sports fans?

JASON

Yes. Sports fans.

LINGA

Who didn't vote for him. Who

probably hate him. Who came out of

the womb with guns in their hands.

CUT TO:

22.

CUT TO:

JASON

(shouting against the

NOISE)

I want your eyes on the crowd at

all times. We're staying in the

middle of the field. He's going to

walk out, shake hands, walk back.

Nothing else. Got it?

JASON

Here we go.

23.

MANDELA

Good luck, captain.

PIENAAR

(SHAKING HANDS)

Thank you, sir.

JASON

(INTO RADIO)

Stay with him.

ETIENNE

Stop him.

JASON

Stay with him.

24.

MANDELA

Thank you for honoring our new

flag!

JASON

We're delaying the rugby, Madiba.

MANDELA

Oh, yes, of course.

ETIENNE

Why didn't you stop him?

JASON

Next time, you try.

25.

ETIENNE

Does he do that sort of thing all

the time?

JASON

Ask my ulcer.

(BEAT)

Good thing that was just an orange.

ETIENNE

And good thing he never saw it.

JASON

Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.

(rubbing his ulcer)

I hate rugby.

CUT TO:

26.

PIENAAR

Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We

can beat these guys if we play our

game, not theirs!

MANDELA

Shall we work while we watch? We

have lots of promises to keep.

BARBARA

Yes, we do.

MANDELA

It's not too late, if the boys can

just pick up their game.

RUGBY PRESIDENT

If they don't, heads will roll.

This is unacceptable.

(LEANING FORWARD)

Come on you bloody bastards!

27.

BARBARA

Where do you want go first, for

foreign investment?

MANDELA

Where the money is. America,

England, Saudi Arabia.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BARBARA

Do you see all the old apartheid

flags? It's a disgrace.

MANDELA

It's also a constitutional right.

BARBARA

Along with the apartheid anthem. I

know. But it's time people moved

on.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

28.

MANDELA

Look at that. The whites are

cheering for the Springboks, the

blacks are cheering for the Lions.

MANDELA

We did that on the island, you

know. We supported anyone but the

`boks. It really irritated the

warders.

BARBARA

Of course it did.

CUT TO:

FIELD --

CUT TO:

MANDELA

How long until the World Cup?

RUGBY PRESIDENT

About a year.

MANDELA

Plenty of time for improvement.

29.

RUGBY PRESIDENT

Mr. President -- I wouldn't get my

hopes up. We're a damn disgrace.

MANDELA

I want to go to India and

Indonesia, too.

MINISTER OF SPORT

Sorry I'm late.

MINISTER OF SPORT

How's it going?

MANDELA

Very badly.

MINISTER OF SPORT

Maybe it's just as well.

MANDELA

Why?

MINISTER OF SPORT

(bending close, talking

QUIETLY)

I've just been at a meeting of the

National Sports Council executive.

There's strong support to drop the

Springbok emblem and colors

altogether.

(gesturing at the field)

If they're playing badly, maybe its

a good time to make a change.

(with barely hidden

RELISH)

(MORE)

30.

MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd)

This could be the last time we have

to look at the green and gold.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

Francois Pienaar's team came to

Loftus Versfeld stadium this

afternoon, unprepared and arrogant.

31.

BOLAND BOTHA

They left 80 minutes later with

their tails between their legs,

like whipped mongrels.

(BEAT)

And I, for one, am glad. Not

because we lost, but because

there's now no way to disguise the

fact that we are completely and

utterly unprepared to reenter the

world of top-notch international

rugby.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)

The Rugby World Cup is now less

than a year away, and I, for one,

am relieved that we are the host

nation, and therefore qualify

automatically for the tournament.

Because I'm not sure we would get

in on merit alone.

RUGBY PRESIDENT

Who gets the axe? Someone has to.

CUT TO:

32.

BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)

Pienaar's team played without

discipline, without strategy and

without courage.

PIENAAR

He's trying to get them to drop me.

NERINE

He's just bitter because the

Springboks were boycotted when he

played.

PIENAAR

Maybe, but people listen to what he

says.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)

They brought shame upon our nation,

and I, for one, can say without

fear of contradiction, that today,

these fifteen so-called men did not

deserve to wear the hallowed green

and gold.

MARY

Here's your muti. I warmed the

milk tonight.

MANDELA

You're too good to me.

MARY

Your daughter called, to cancel her

visit this weekend.

33.

MANDELA

Did she say why?

MARY

No, she didn't.

(making it up)

She said to tell you she was sorry.

MARY

Do you need anything else tonight?

MANDELA

No, thank you. I'm going to bed.

Good night.

MARY

Good night, Madiba. Sleep well.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. COLEMAN (O.S.)

No pushing now! There's enough for

everybody!

34.

MRS. DLAMINI

God bless you.

MRS. COLEMAN

You're a very lucky boy. It's a

real Springbok practise jersey!

It's a bit big, but it's warm and

it'll last for ever!

MRS. COLEMAN

It's yours, take it! Go on.

MRS. COLEMAN

Why won't he take it?

MRS. DLAMINI

If he wears it, the others will

beat him up.

MRS. COLEMAN

Because the Springboks are playing

so badly?

MRS. DLAMINI

No. Because, for them, the

Springboks still represent

apartheid.

CUT TO:

35.

NSC FIREBRAND

... and now for the next item on

our agenda.

NSC FIREBRAND

The NSC executive proposes a full

membership vote on the following

motion ...

NSC FIREBRAND

... that as a prominent symbol of

the apartheid era, the colors,

emblem and name of the Springboks

be eliminated immediately ...

NSC FIREBRAND

... and that all sports teams

representing South Africa shall be

known forthwith as the Proteas.

NSC FIREBRAND

(SHOUTING)

We will submit this motion to a

hand vote.

(MORE)

36.

NSC FIREBRAND (cont'd)

In the event of a close count, we

will go to a written ballot.

(the moment he's been

WAITING FOR)

ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING

THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JASON

Both units to the cars, right now.

37.

BARBARA

What do I tell the Japanese trade

delegation?

MANDELA

I delegate that decision to you.

BARBARA

Do you want me to inform the VP?

MANDELA

No.

BARBARA

We should at least include the

Minister of Sport.

MANDELA

No.

BARBARA

I strongly advise against doing

this. Especially on your own. It

... it gives the impression of

autocratic leadership.

BARBARA

You risk alienating your cabinet

and your party.

MANDELA

Your advice is duly noted, Barbara.

38.

BARBARA

Madiba ... the people want this.

They hate the Springboks. They

don't want to be represented by a

team they cheered against all their

lives.

MANDELA

Yes, I know. But in this instance

the people are wrong. And it is my

job as their elected leader to make

them see that.

MANDELA

Can you tell the boys that Madiba

wants to go to Eersterust, very

fast.

BARBARA

You're risking your political

capital. You're risking your

future as our leader.

MANDELA

The day I am afraid to do that is

the day I am no longer fit to lead.

BARBARA

At least risk it for something more

important than rugby.

NSC FIREBRAND (V.O.)

... and in concluding this historic

conference ...

39.

NSC FIREBRAND

... brothers, sisters, comrades, we

in the executive applaud your

diligence and courage.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NSC FIREBRAND

Brothers, sisters ... join us in

our anthem.

CHOIR

(SINGING)

Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God

Bless Africa) --

40.

NSC FIREBRAND

Brothers, sisters, members of the

choir -- we would only interrupt

such beautiful music for something

truly important. In this case, for

someone truly important.

(beat, milking it)

Please welcome President Mandela!

JASON

(INTO RADIO)

Smile.

MANDELA

Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am

here because I feel strongly that

you made a decision today without

sufficient information or

foresight.

41.

MANDELA

I am aware of your earlier vote. I

am aware that it was unanimous.

(BEAT)

Nonetheless, I propose that we

restore the Springboks. Restore

their name, their emblem and their

colors, immediately.

MANDELA

Let me tell you why ...

MANDELA

... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor

Prison, my jailers were all

Afrikaners.

(BEAT)

For twenty seven years, I studied

them. I learned their language, I

read their history, I read their

poetry. I had to know my enemy, in

order to prevail against him.

(BEAT)

And we prevailed, did we not? All

of us here ... we prevailed.

MANDELA

Our enemy is no longer the

Afrikaner. They are our fellow

South Africans, our partners in

democracy.

MANDELA

And they treasure Springbok rugby.

If we take that away, we lose them.

We prove that we are what they

feared we would be.

(BEAT)

We have to be better than that.

(MORE)

42.

MANDELA (CONT'D)

We have to surprise them with

compassion, with restraint, and

generosity.

MANDELA

Yes, I know. All the things they

denied us.

MANDELA

But this is not the time to enjoy a

moment's petty revenge. This is

the time to build our nation using

every single brick available to us -

- even if that brick comes clothed

in green and gold.

MANDELA

(ANGRY)

You elected me.

(BEAT)

You elected me to be your leader.

Let me lead you now.

(BEAT)

Who is with me on this?

MANDELA

Who is with me?

CUT TO:

43.

BARBARA

Twelve votes. Twelve!

MANDELA

A luxury. All we needed was one

more yes than no.

BARBARA

What if you hadn't got it?

MANDELA

Well, as you know, I am an obedient

party member.

BARBARA

I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got

problems everywhere we look.

Housing, food, jobs, crime, our

currency. You can't keep

interrupting affairs of state to

placate a minority.

MANDELA

But, I must. This minority still

controls the army, the police, and

the economy. Without them, we

cannot address the other problems.

44.

BARBARA

So this rugby, it's just a

political calculation?

MANDELA

It's a human calculation.

(BEAT)

If we take away what they cherish --

the Springboks, their national

anthem -- we just reinforce the

cycle of fear between us.

MANDELA

I will do what I must to break this

cycle. Or it will destroy us.

DISSOLVE TO:

SWIG --

ANGRY SPRINGBOK

This beer tastes like kuk.

PIENAAR

It's not the beer.

45.

PIENAAR

Take another.

(BEAT)

Everybody take a beer.

PIENAAR

A toast ...

PIENAAR

... to the taste of defeat.

PIENAAR

Drink it. Remember it. And

promise yourself never to taste it

again.

PIENAAR

You're right. It tastes like kuk.

CUT TO:

JASON

Here's the schedule for the

overseas trip.

46.

LINGA

What did he just say?

HENDRICK

I said --

ETIENNE

He asked when we were supposed to

sleep.

HENDRICK

As well as other basic human

functions.

JASON

Hey. If Madiba can do it, we can

do it.

CUT TO:

MANDELA

The millions of our people say

thank you, and thank you again.

CUT TO:

MANDELA

I have come here with a message.

People of the Unites States of

America: Open your markets to us.

People of the United States of

American: Come and invest in our

country.

Morning boys.

Morning, sir.

MANDELA

How is your family, Hendrick?

50.

HENDRICK

Top shape, sir. How about yours?

MANDELA

I have a very big family. 42

million people.

MANDELA

I don't think I want to walk today.

LINGA

We never ask him about his family.

HENDRICK

But he asks about ours all the

time.

LINGA

Think about it, man. He's

separated from his wife. His

children ... how often do you see

them here?

(BEAT)

He's not a saint, okay. He's a

man, with a man's problems -- and

he doesn't need us reminding him

about them.

Hello Barbara. I like that dress.

BARBARA

Thank you Madiba.

(OFFERING ENVELOPE)

This is for you.

MANDELA

(TAKING ENVELOPE)

What is it?

BARBARA

Your pay checks. You haven't been

collecting them.

BARBARA

What's wrong?

MANDELA

This is terrible.

BARBARA

Madiba, it's what De Klerk got.

Plus an increase for inflation.

52.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Today, President Mandela announced

that, in his opinion --

CUT TO:

TV ANNOUNCER

(on TV throughout)

-- his salary is too high.

MR. PIENAAR

Dead right. They're all overpaid.

TV ANNOUNCER

He has therefore decided to donate

a third of his monthly income to

charity.

MR. PIENAAR

Give me the houses and cars they

give him and I'll donate a third of

my salary too.

PIENAAR

(to Mr. Pienaar)

You would not. Not in a million

years.

PIENAAR

(ANSWERING PHONE)

Hallo, Pienaar.

PIENAAR

(INTO PHONE)

Hang on a moment, please.

TV ANNOUNCER

President Mandela said that he

wished to set an example to other

leaders and cabinet ministers.

53.

MR. PIENAAR

Fat chance. They're lining their

pockets as fast as they can.

MR. PIENAAR

Must be his girlfriend, hey Nerine.

NERINE

He knows I'd bloody kill him.

NERINE

What? Who was it?

MR. PIENAAR

Told you. It was his girlfriend.

MRS. PIENAAR

Shush!

PIENAAR

I've been invited to tea.

NERINE

Who with?

PIENAAR

The President.

MR. PIENAAR

The President of SA Rugby? Count

your fingers after he shakes your

hand.

PIENAAR

The President.

54.

PIENAAR

He wants me over for tea, week

after next.

EUNICE

Mr. Francois -- you must tell

Madiba that the bus service is very

bad, and too expensive. He must

please fix it.

(LEAVING)

Good night everybody.

MRS. PIENAAR

Good night Eunice, thank you.

MR. PIENAAR

What the hell does he want with

you?

DISSOLVE TO:

NERINE

Francois, relax. You've met him

before.

PIENAAR

I shook his hand on the rugby

field, that's all.

NERINE

You didn't even vote for him.

55.

PIENAAR

He's still the President.

(CONFESSING)

He's had dinner with the Queen.

With Presidents and movie stars.

All I do is play rugby. What if I

pull something stupid in front of

him?

NERINE

You won't. I'll pick you up right

here.

CUT TO:

ETIENNE

See who's coming for tea?

HENDRICK

My nephew wants me to get his

autograph.

LINGA

Who?

ETIENNE

Francois Pienaar.

JASON

Who wants to escort him in?

HENDRICK

I will.

56.

JASON

No autographs.

HENDRICK

(INSULTED)

I know how to do my job, okay.

LINGA

Who's this Pienaar?

ETIENNE

You can't be serious? He's the

captain of the Springboks.

LINGA

I like soccer, myself.

ETIENNE

Well, you know what they say about

soccer -- it's gentleman's game

played by hooligans. One the other

hand, rugby is a hooligan's game

played by --

LINGA

Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It

wasn't funny the first time.

PIENAAR

Can I ask you a question,

Lieutenant?

HENDRICK

Ja, of course.

PIENAAR

What's he like?

57.

HENDRICK

When I worked for the previous

President, it was my job to be

invisible.

HENDRICK

This President ... he found out I

like English toffee and brought me

some back, from his visit to the

Queen.

HENDRICK

To him, nobody is invisible.

HENDRICK

That's where you wait. One of his

assistants will come for you.

(POINTING)

There's a bathroom over there, if

you need it.

PIENAAR

Okay. Thanks.

HENDRICK

What are our chances in the World

Cup? I mean, for real.

PIENAAR

We'll do our best. That, I can

guarantee.

58.

HENDRICK

Well, he's not as big as he looks

on TV.

(BEAT)

And we don't stand a bloody chance

in the World Cup.

MARY

Mr. Pienaar?

MARY

This way, please.

MARY

Go on in.

59.

MANDELA

Francois, what an honor. I'm so

excited.

MANDELA

Thank you for coming all this way

to see me.

PIENAAR

Yes, sir. No problem. Thank you

for inviting me.

MANDELA

Tell me. How's your ankle?

PIENAAR

My ankle?

MANDELA

I was told you'd hurt it. Has it

healed?

PIENAAR

The truth is, sir, you never play

at a hundred percent, no matter

what.

MANDELA

Yes ... yes. In sports, and in

life. Come. Sit. Please.

(indicating a chair)

Take this one. Looking into the

light hurts my eyes.

MANDELA

Ah, Mrs. Brits --

60.

MANDELA

-- you are a shining light in my

day.

MRS. BRITS

Yes sir.

MANDELA

Mrs. Brits, this is Francois

Pienaar. He's the captain of the

Springboks.

PIENAAR

(AFRIKAANS GREETING)

Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.

MRS. BRITS

Ek ook, Meneer.

(TO MANDELA)

Shall I pour, sir?

MANDELA

No thank you, I think I'd like to.

MANDELA

How do you take your tea, Francois?

PIENAAR

Milk and sugar, please.

61.

MANDELA

The English have given us many

things, including rugby, but

afternoon tea is one of the

greatest.

PIENAAR

Thank you, sir.

MANDELA

You have a very difficult job.

PIENAAR

I do? I sell gas braais.

MANDELA

Captain of the Springboks. A very

difficult job.

PIENAAR

Not compared to yours, sir.

MANDELA

Ah, but then nobody is trying to

tear my head off while I'm doing

mine.

MANDELA

It is not so difficult to get

people to do their best. And I

imagine that anybody who plays for

their country does their best,

almost automatically.

PIENAAR

Or they wouldn't be chosen in the

first place.

MANDELA

Yes. But to get people to be

better than that?

(MORE)

62.

MANDELA (CONT'D)

Better than they think they can be?

Now, that is difficult, I find.

PIENAAR

Yes sir, it is.

MANDELA

How do we do that? By example? To

an extent. But there is more to it

than that ...

(searching for the right

WORD)

... inspiration, perhaps.

MANDELA

How do we inspire ourselves to

greatness, when nothing less will

do? How do we inspire everyone

around us?

(BEAT)

Sometimes, I think, by using the

work of others.

MANDELA

On Robben Island, when things were

very hard, I found inspiration in a

poem.

PIENAAR

A poem?

MANDELA

A Victorian poem. Just words. But

they helped me to stand when all I

wanted was to lie down --

(SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE)

But you didn't come all this way to

hear an old man talk about things

that make no sense.

PIENAAR

No! They make a lot of sense, sir.

(BEAT)

On the day of a big match, say a

test, in the bus on the way to the

stadium, nobody talks.

63.

MANDELA

Yes ... yes. Everybody is

preparing.

PIENAAR

When I think we're ready, I have

the bus driver put on a song I've

chosen; a theme song. One we all

know. We listen together and ...

it helps.

MANDELA

Yes! I remember when I was a guest

at the 1992 Olympic Games in

Barcelona. The whole stadium

welcomed me with a song.

(BEAT)

At the time the future -- our

future -- seemed very bleak. But

to hear that song, in voices from

all over our planet ... it made me

very proud to be South African. It

helped me to come home and do

better. It allowed me to expect

more of myself.

PIENAAR

May I ask what the song was, sir?

MANDELA

Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel'

iAfrika. A very inspiring song.

MANDELA

We need inspiration, Francois.

MANDELA

Because, in order to build our

nation, we all need to exceed our

own expectations.

64.

PIENAAR

Yes, sir. We probably do.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NERINE

So ...?

PIENAAR

Hm?

NERINE

What's he like?

PIENAAR

He's ...

(BEAT)

... he's not like anyone I've ever

met before.

65.

NERINE

Well? What did he want?

NERINE

Ag, come on Francois. It's like

talking to a bloody brick wall.

What did he want?

PIENAAR

I think ...

(BEAT)

I think he wants us to win the

World Cup.

DISSOLVE TO:

MANDELA

Excuse me.

CUT TO:

66.

MANDELA

What do you think?

ZINDZI

It doesn't matter what I think.

MANDELA

Yes, it does.

ZINDZI

(DEFIANT)

Okay. I think he looks like one of

the policemen who forced us out of

our house when you were in jail. I

don't like seeing you shake his

hand. And I'm not the only one.

MANDELA

You criticize without

understanding. You seek only to

address your own feelings. This is

selfish thinking. It does not

serve the nation.

MANDELA

Wait. Please. I --

MANDELA

Will you give this to your mother.

ZINDZI

What is it?

MANDELA

A bracelet.

ZINDZI

Just throw it away.

MANDELA

I don't have the right to. It's

not mine.

67.

ZINDZI

If she left it here, she meant to

throw it away.

CUT TO:

EUNICE

Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished

with the paper.

MR. PIENAAR

Ja. Of course.

CUT TO:

68.

MINISTER OF SPORT (V.O.)

The World Cup is played every four

years. Sixteen teams qualify from

around the world.

CUT TO:

MINISTER OF SPORT

Four pools of four teams each,

playing in nine different venues

around the country. Two teams will

advance from each pool to the

quarter finals.

MANDELA

The Ivory Coast qualified. This is

wonderful.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MINISTER OF SPORT

Australia won the previous World

Cup. New Zealand won the one

before that.

(MORE)

69.

MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd)

They're both clear favorites to

reach the finals this time.

(BEAT)

According to the experts, we'll

reach the quarter finals, and no

further.

MANDELA

According to the experts, you and I

are still supposed to be in jail.

CUT TO:

COACH

Again!

CUT TO:

MINISTER OF SPORT

You make a personal appearance at

the finals, and at the opening

match between the Springboks and

Australia.

(BEAT)

The finals will be broadcast to

over a billion people around the

world, live.

MANDELA

A billion people watching us!

(wheels turning in his

HEAD)

Yes ... yes. This is a great

opportunity.

CUT TO:

70.

SPRINGBOK MANAGER

I reckon you've knocked the

stuffing out of them today.

COACH

I haven't even begun.

(BEAT)

We may not be the most talented

team in the world -- but we're

going to be the fittest.

COACH

And back!

PIENAAR

Come on boys, let's show him.

SPRINGBOK FLANK

Shit, what's Pienaar been eating?

CUT TO:

MANDELA

(INTO PHONE)

Please call the head of South

African rugby for me.

CUT TO:

71.

RUGBY PRESIDENT

Afternoon men. It's good to see

you working so hard. I have a

short announcement.

(BEAT)

As part of the PR buildup to the

World Cup, you will be conducting

coaching clinics in townships all

over the country.

RUGBY PRESIDENT

I know you have plenty on your

plates already -- but this is a

request that comes from the top.

(looking at Pienaar,

POINTEDLY)

The very top.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

This is complete crap.

SPRINGBOK FLANK

Are we some kind of circus act now?

72.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

We don't have time for kuk like

this.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

They expect us to play our best, to

give our bloody all, then they add

to our bloody workload ...

SPRINGBOK LOCK

What do you think about this,

Chester?

CHESTER WILLIAMS

I try not to think. It interferes

with my rugby.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

See! Now there's a rugby player.

Talk to them Francois.

SPRINGBOK WING

Make them see that this is a waste

of time we don't have.

PIENAAR

I'm not going to talk to them.

SPRINGBOK FLANK

Why not?

PIENAAR

Whether we like it or not, we're

more than just a rugby team. We're

... we're ambassadors inside our

own country. And we might as well

get used to it.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

Is this you speaking, or Mandela?

73.

PIENAAR

You know me better than that.

(BEAT)

Times change. We need to change,

too.

DISSOLVE TO:

TV ANNOUNCER (ON TV)

We're looking at the remains of the

Federal Building in Oklahoma City,

America, which was destroyed today

in a massive explosion.

TV ANNOUNCER

No one has claimed responsibility

yet, but authorities say that the

timing and target mark this as the

work of white, right-wing fanatics.

An act of revenge for the FBI

killings in Waco, Texas.

TV ANNOUNCER

The explosive, a truck bomb, was

apparently a simple mixture of

commonly available industrial and

agricultural materials.

JASON

(TO LINGA)

That's all we need.

(MORE)

74.

JASON (CONT'D)

A homemade explosive from materials

every boer already has.

TV ANNOUNCER

So far, the official death toll

stands at over a 100 people, which

includes at least 12 children from

a day care center in the Federal

building.

MANDELA

Please call President Clinton for

me. I wish to offer him our

condolences.

MANDELA

Do you see why forgiveness is

essential, Jason?

(BEAT)

Revenge only begets revenge.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

Shit, I'm glad I don't live here.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

What the hell are they doing?

PIENAAR

Don't forget, we've got TV cameras

on us at all times.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

(MUTTERING)

What a bloody joke.

77.

ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY

THAT --

PIENAAR

Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.

CHESTER WILLIAMS

(PANICKING)

What am I supposed to do?

PIENAAR

What you do best.

PIENAAR

WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY?

PIENAAR

Let rip.

78.

PIENAAR

Let's do our best.

PIENAAR

Go get them!

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

Who here knows the first rule of

rugby?

TOWNSHIP KID

Me!

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

What is it?

TOWNSHIP KID

Only hit the other players when the

ref isn't looking!

PIENAAR

No. The first rule of rugby is you

can only pass the ball backwards or

sideways.

VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS

- If you drop the ball, or pass it

forwards, you scrum for possession.

- This is a scrum.

- You kick forwards.

(MORE)

79.

VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd)

If you kick it out of bounds, you

throw it back in to a lineout.

- This is a lineout.

- You score in four ways: a try,

when you dot the ball down behind

the try line. That's five points.

- Another two points when you

convert the try by kicking the ball

through the uprights.

- Three points for a penalty kick.

- Three points for a drop kick.

- Have you got all that?

KIDS

No!

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

Agh, bugger it, let's just run and

pass. Whoever drops the ball does

pushups!

SPRINGBOK LOCK

Okay. Who wants to scrum against

me?

CUT TO:

80.

MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT

-- and in addition to the

nationwide PR campaign, we propose

that all retail outlets charge a

nominal fee for plastic bags --

MANDELA

Mr. Minister, please forgive me.

This sounds excellent, and we will

return to it, but if you'll indulge

me for just one minute --

MANDELA

You see, that picture is worth any

number of speeches.

CUT TO:

MR. PIENAAR

Tell me something -- how does this

help them win rugby matches?

DISSOLVE TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

This is Boland Botha coming to you

live from Cape Town airport --

BOLAND BOTHA

-- where the Springbok flight has

just landed.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

The green and gold have one week to

put the finishing touches to their

gruelling training program --

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

-- and I, for one, have to admit to

being cautiously excited.

82.

BOLAND BOTHA

(INTO MIKE)

I say cautiously, because in my

humble opinion --

BOLAND BOTHA

-- this team has been over-trained

on the field, and over-committed

off it.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)

Which makes beating a powerhouse

Australian side in the Cup opener

next week a tall order, especially

since this is an inexperienced team

with a history of coming up short

in big matches. This is Boland

BOTHA --

MANDELA

Around the world -- objectively --

what are they saying about our

chances against Australia?

MINISTER OF SPORT

Everyone thinks they'll beat us.

And if they do, we'll have to go

through England and the All Blacks

just to get to the Final.

MANDELA

So it is very important that we

beat Australia.

(to Minister of Sport)

Thank you.

83.

BARBARA

The Cabinet Ministers are here to

brief you on the trip to Taiwan.

MANDELA

I'll be right out.

Out of the night that covers me ...

COACH

One week, boys.

JASON

We need snipers on top of the

stadium and these surrounding

buildings.

LOCAL COP

Not a problem.

JASON

We want these two approaches

completely sanitized.

LOCAL COP

Two approaches?

JASON

We're not going to decide which way

we bring him in until the very last

moment.

(BEAT)

We need uniforms, plain clothes,

sharp-shooters ...

LINGA

And sniffer dogs.

JASON

Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma

City.

JASON

We've got an army unit on standby

at Silvermine, if you need more

men.

85.

JASON

We're not taking any chances, okay.

The President's going to be very

exposed.

(BEAT)

Much too exposed.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

PIENAAR

Sort of.

SPRINGBOK WING

Cappie? What's this?

PIENAAR

We need to learn it. We can't just

mouth the words anymore.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

Nobody cares, as long as we win

matches.

PIENAAR

They do care.

SPRINGBOK LOCK

It's their song, not ours.

SPRINGBOK WING

It's a terrorist song.

SPRINGBOK PROP

They used to arrest you for singing

it.

PIENAAR

And now it's one of our anthems.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

Cap. You know I leave my guts on

the field for you, and you know I'd

follow you into a fight anywhere,

any time. But this ...

SPRINGBOK HOOKER

... I can't even read it. I

definitely can't pronounce the

words.

88.

PIENAAR

Okay, boys. It's optional. Take

it if you want to.

PIENAAR

It means "God Bless Africa".

(BEAT)

Which you have to admit, we could

use.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA

Tell us, Mr. President, have you

always been a rugby fan?

MANDELA

People do not realize that I once

played rugby myself, when I was a

student at Fort Hare. It is a very

rough game. Almost as rough as

politics.

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

How do you think the Springboks

will do?

MANDELA (V.O.)

I think they will do very well.

Their level of commitment is

tremendous.

89.

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

Now, it's been said that you used

to support any team who played

against the Springboks.

MANDELA (V.O.)

Obviously, that is no longer true.

I am one hundred percent behind our

boys.

MANDELA

After all, if I cannot change when

circumstances demand it, how can I

ask others to?

JASON

(ON RADIO)

We're going to land you on top of

that building. We'll own the road

between it and the stadium.

90.

MANDELA

Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me

for interrupting your work the day

before such an important match ...

(BEAT)

... I just wanted to wish you good

luck, in person.

MANDELA

And sometimes, very seldom, as

President, I am allowed to do what

I want.

PIENAAR

(DOING INTRODUCTIONS)

Mr. President, this is --

I know who this is.

Good luck, Andre.

all. Japie -- etc

Did you ever imagine this?

JASON

How could I?

MANDELA

But where is Chester?

PIENAAR

He's injured, sir. His hamstring.

We're trying to keep it quiet.

MANDELA

Is he out for the whole tournament?

PIENAAR

With hamstrings, who knows?

(BEAT)

We'll miss him.

MANDELA

The whole country will miss him.

SPRINGBOK PROP

Mr. President, sir --

MANDELA

Yes, Hennie.

MANDELA

I am honored. Truly honored.

MANDELA

Good luck gentlemen. Your country

supports you, completely.

MANDELA

PIENAAR

Uh uh. I need to be angry for

The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to

MINISTER OF SPORT

-- they beat Wales 34 to 9, they

beat Japan 145 to 17.

MANDELA

145 points, in one match?

MINISTER OF SPORT

It's a new international record.

(back to the briefing)

They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the

quarter finals. You saw the match

with England.

MANDELA

45 to 29. And it was not that

close.

(BEAT)

They seem unstoppable.

MINISTER OF SPORT

If opposing teams play them

straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.

If they focus on Lomu, that leaves

others free.

(BEAT)

And, also, there's the business of

the haka.

116.

MANDELA

Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's

very powerful.

MINISTER OF SPORT

My sources tell me that half of the

All Black matches are won before

the first whistle, because of it.

MANDELA

How are we going to beat them?

MINISTER OF SPORT

I have the coach's number. You

could call him and ask.

MANDELA

No ... no. I don't want to break

their focus for even a minute.

(INTENSE)

But, how do we win?

MINISTER OF SPORT

Maybe we won't. They're favored

two-to-one.

(BEAT)

Madiba, we've already exceeded all

expectations. On and off the

field.

MANDELA

It's not enough. Not now. Not so

close.

(BEAT)

This country is hungry for

greatness.

CUT TO:

117.

COACH

How's the feeling in the dressing

room?

PIENAAR

Calm.

MANAGER

And Lomu? Are they talking about

him?

COACH

Nobody gives us a bloody chance. I

like that. It plays into their one

weakness.

COACH

Their vanity.

(BEAT)

They're already counting the win.

But they want to win with style,

the way they won all their other

matches. They want to show the

world how beautiful All Black rugby

is.

(GLARING)

I just want to show the bloody

world how hard we tackle.

PIENAAR

I wish tomorrow was already here.

CUT TO:

118.

ETIENNE

(from behind him)

Come on, man. There's nothing more

you can do today.

JASON

Have I ever mentioned to you that I

hate rugby?

ETIENNE

Once or twice, yes.

JASON

I just want to get him through

tomorrow, safely. That's all.

ETIENNE

We all do.

CUT TO:

NERINE

I brought one of your mom's protein

shakes.

NERINE

Thinking about tomorrow?

119.

PIENAAR

No, tomorrow's taken care of, one

way or another.

PIENAAR

I'm thinking about how you spend 30

years in a tiny cell, but come out

ready to forgive the people who put

you there.

DISSOLVE TO:

LINGA

Big day.

HENDRICK

Be an even bigger day if we

actually won.

120.

HENDRICK

Where is he?

CUT TO:

MANDELA

Can a man not sleep in, when he has

a big day ahead of him?

CUT TO:

LINGA

(INTO RADIO)

Okay, thanks. Out.

LINGA

He's sleeping in.

HENDRICK

Or was.

LINGA

I had an idea. About today.

(BEAT)

It's a crazy idea.

121.

HENDRICK

Hey, don't worry, man. I already

know you're crazy.

CUT TO:

MANDELA

Morning, boys.

LINGA & HENDRICK

Morning, Madiba.

MANDELA

What is it?

HENDRICK

Linga had an idea, sir.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

122.

HENDRICK

Now you've done it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JASON

The tickets sold out long before

the team became so popular. So

it's not exactly going to be the

rainbow nation out there. That's

the reality.

(BEAT)

The President will greet the

players before the match, he'll

present the trophy after the match.

He'll be exposed to 62,000 people,

twice. He'll be on TV, live, all

over the world.

(expressing his deepest

FEAR)

All it takes is one idiot trying to

make a statement, or one crazy fool

who thinks he hears god speaking to

him over the radio.

123.

JASON

It's happened before!

(SUPER INTENSE)

But not today. Not on our watch.

Not today.

CUT TO:

FACE PAINTER

(TO BOERE)

BOER

Bugger off!

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

We're at Ellis Park on this

historic day, where, even this

early, crowd excitement is at fever

PITCH --

HIM

BOLAND BOTHA

-- because their beloved green and

gold have somehow managed to exceed

all expectations.

CUT TO:

124.

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

But now they come up against a team

that is unlike any other they have

played.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

These All Blacks are possibly one

of the greatest international sides

ever, with a player in Jonah Lomu

who is as dominant as any this

correspondent has ever seen.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

To lose to them is no disgrace. To

lose to them in the finals is, in

fact, an honor.

CUT TO:

BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)

I say this with absolutely no

negativity. I simply want to save

people from the heartbreak of

unrealistic expectations.

CUT TO:

125.

BOLAND BOTHA

So, take a reality check, sit back

and share an afternoon with one

billion fellow fans around the

world. And as you do, feel a

special pride in having made it

this far. This is Boland Botha,

signing off and sitting back at

Ellis Park.

Duly noted.

Do you see that jet, to the east?

CUT TO:

ETIENNE

(INTO RADIO)

Did they get clearance for this?

CUT TO:

JASON

(INTO RADIO)

Not from us.

JASON

Where is he?

VIP BOX.

Get him out of there. Now.

All your gold, for all our sheep?

I was thinking more along the lines

of a case of wine.

What happens now?

HENDRICK

Extra time. Twenty minutes.

LINGA

I don't think I can take it.

Who's the fittest team on this

field?

PIENAAR

Keep it here. Run it forward.

BOLAND BOTHA

Francois ... a few words ...

BOLAND BOTHA

... great game, but I don't think

you could've done it without the

amazing support of these 63,000

South Africans --

PIENAAR

(into mike, words booming)

We didn't have the support of

63,000 South Africans today. We

had the support of 42 million South

Africans.

SPRINGBOK MANAGER

They're waiting for you over there.

142.

MANDELA

Francois, I want to thank you most

sincerely for what you have done to

our country.

Mr. President, I want to thank you

MANDELA

Tell Jason it's all right. There's

no hurry.

LINGA

(INTO RADIO)

Madiba says no need to hurry.

FADE EVER SO

SLOWLY TO BLACK.
