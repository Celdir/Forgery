JUSTINE

Falls back on the pillow,

disappointed. It's as if she'd

HEINZ

Shhaaapes ...

HANNA

What about them?

DRUCKER

According to the janitor, he...

(Guard Two outline)

Started mouthing off to one of

the gunmen.

HANNA

Oh, that was smart.

DRUCKER

I figure the other went for...

(points)

... that gun when the shooting

started. One guy called a guard

"slick."

HANNA

"Slick?"

DRUCKER

Yeah.   And they ignored the loose

cash.

HANNA

'Cause they had no time, cause

they knew our response time,

cause they were on our air.

HEINZ

You recognize their m.o.?

HANNA

Yeah. Their m.o. is that they

are good. Once it escalated

into a Murder One beef for all

of them after they killed the

first two, they popped guard

number three 'cause it didn't

rake any difference anymore, so

why leave a living witness?

Drop of a hat? They'll rock and

roll. Also: the way they went

into the side indicates they are

equipped to go in on the prowl.

So also start looking for recent

highline burgularies that have

'mystified' us.

(to Drucker)

Run the "slick" bit to the FBI

and see what it kicks out.

DRUCKER

I called it in already.

HANNA

(to Casals)

Split the fences. I'll take

Cuzomano and Torena. You take

the East side. Go through the

tapes of who we been listening

to.

(to Drucker)

Hang in with Forensics on all

physical evidence.

(to Bosko)

How'd they know the route of the

van and what it was carrying?

Does Gage print the day's routes?

What do they do with the

printouts? Who collects their

trash? Run makes on all their

middlemanagement. Did someone

give this score up?

Check the three guards. See if

one of them was a tipster.

Out-of-town. Frankly, I hope

EADY (V.O.)

The plates are mezzotints. They

CUT TO:

NEIL

What is it?

CEZAR

A bank. On Thursdays it gets

cash deposits for distribution

to other branches. The branches

have to buttress their cash

accounts to handle Friday payroll

checks from a Toyota and Nissan

plant, a steel mill and two

refineries. One day a week,

Thursday, the main branch carries

the full whack.

NEIL

You want a $100,000 advance,

against a full 101. Why?

CEZAR

'Cause I can get it. 'Cause

this is the best thing I seen in

three years. 'Cause a screw-up

makes 10 percent of nothin' equal

nothin'. And 'cause those are

the terms and they ain't

negotiable.

NEIL

On the prowl or strong?

CEZAR

Strong. Through the front door.

During the day.

NEIL

How many guys?

CEZAR

Four.   Three plus a driver.

NEIL

That's not a $100,000 worth

anything. You're giving me an

address to what's strictly a

cowboy score: "Get the guns and

let's go!" We smash, grab and

boogie while they hit the alarm.

CEZAR

Three alarms. And that's why

the price. 'Cause you chop-in

through the roof the night before

on the prowl and bypass 'em. I

got circuit diagrams, blue prints,

the works. So yeah, they hit

the alarms, but nothing gonna

happen.

Do I have to kill people?

Dedicated. Divorced three times.

Current wife's Justine. He's

He's right. And you know it.

You think you'd be betraying

Chris?

CHARLENE

(right to his face)

Yes.

FARINA

Well, you're right. You would

be. But if you don't betray

Chris, you betray Dominick.

Because he becomes an orphan

when you go to prison as an

accessory 'cause you got no living

parents to take him. Then he

ends up state-raised and fucked

for life. Your son Dominick's

innocent. He didn't choose a

life like that. Chris did.

Now Hugh Benny has reformed his

wayward life and become a born-

revealed the key player is this

cowboy Waingro. Used to be part

of Neil's crew. Waingro committed

a double murder today on Towner,

a driver, and his old lady.

(pause)

Meanwhile Waingro's checked into

the Airport Hyatt House under

"Jamieson." Maybe Neil will make

a move on him, but not likely.
