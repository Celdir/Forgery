SHOOTING DRAFT

DISSOLVE TO:

PRICE

'Morning, Jimmy, think you could

squeeze me in?

JIMMY

Where is you would care to go at

once, Mr. Price?

PRICE

Bang-bang.

JIMMY

Twenty dollar.

PRICE

You're a thief, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap?

PRICE

I don't do skies.

CUT TO:

PRICE

(cheerily)

Hi, guys.

OATES

G'damn, Price, you tuna sucking piece

of raw meat -- whatchyou goin' to

Zambeze for?

PRICE

Thought I'd get some great shots of

your head gettin' blown to

smithereens.

OATES

Smithereens?! Be a great fuckin'

picture, eh?

PRICE

Be a prize winner.

OATES

(proudly)

Ya think so?

(beat; changing tone)

Trade ya some greenies for a joint.

(beat)

I gotta have a joint.

PRICE

I'm on the wagon, man, sorry.

OATES

(shrugs)

Ahh. Dope-wise, this place sucks.

(looks around, leans

in confidentially)

Lotta fuckin' coons around here, eh?

PRICE

I thought you were fighting for the

Government?

OATES

I am. This is the Government.

PRICE

These are the Rebels.

OATES

Fuck they are. This is a Government

convoy to Calunda.

PRICE

This is the Abou-Deian Revolutionary

Front.

OATES

You're shitting me.

OATES

These guys be pissed if they knew,

eh?

(Price nods in

agreement; Oates

suddenly gets serious)

This is the dumbest motherfucker I

ever signed up for. Don't pay shit

either.

(Price nods in

agreement)

Nicaragua. That's the spot. Cheap

shrimp, lotta rays -- real thin in

the spook department too, dig?

CUT TO:

OATES

Well hell... I wonder where the

fuckin' Guvmint is?

PRICE

Hold it! Hold it!

OATES

Well, I guess we know where the

Guvmint is.

PRICE

(cynically)

You can walk to work from here.

OATES

Convenient, ain't it?

OATES

My brother just got married.

PRICE

I don't know your brother.

PRICE

What's this?

OATES

Great shit, eh?

OATES

U.S. Gummint offers this house to

any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the

Rebels who chooses to defect to

America with a Russian jet. We know

they ain't gonna run off with no

planes -- but the Rebs don't --

They're scared. They start thinking

about that swimming pool. Damn near

smell that chlorine. Starts workin'

on 'em, and pretty soon they don't

let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their

own spook pilots and destroy their

own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin-

teed.

PRICE

C.I.A.?

OATES

(proudly)

Smartest guys in the world.

(afterthought)

Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh? You'll

be famous.

PRICE

(dispassionately)

Maybe.

OATES

(looking around)

I gotta run... have a good one.

PRICE

I love Africa.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

(on the phone)

"...and so this strange war that

features two provincial governments,

three rival liberation fronts, and

at least twenty-five tribal

associations, grinds into its seventh

year..."

CLAIRE

"...The Battle for the Airfield at

Abou Deia is just another chapter in

this endless story. From Ndjamena,

Chad, this is Claire Stryder."

(beat)

No -- you didn't hear any music --

must be the connection. Okay? So

long.

CLAIRE

Alex, don't play that God damn thing

when I'm filing.

(beat)

We're late.

ALEX

It's my party -- we'll be late. You

called it a "strange war" and an

"endless story." If you filed that

story for me, I'd say you were

editorialishing.

CLAIRE

I like to editorialize. You drunk?

ALEX

Drunk? Only with the memories of

making love with you on the plains

of Fianga as the first Army of

Liberation marched in and opened

fire.

CLAIRE

And freed the Proletariat.

ALEX

Right.

CLAIRE

I'm going to the party without you.

CUT TO:

ALEX

Christ, I don't want to go to this

stupid party. I'm bad at false

modesty.

CLAIRE

You're great at it.

CLAIRE

Alex, you're going to make a great

anchorman in New York and undoubtedly

I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning

hostess -- but I'm not going with

you.

ALEX

You can work out of the East Coast.

We'll get a place on Long Island and

burn our suitcases.

CLAIRE

I still like suitcases.

ALEX

Every Saturday night we'll have a

party... invite all our friends, sit

out on the veranda and interview

each other.

CLAIRE

I've done all that.

ALEX

I haven't.

(beat; changes tack)

Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired

of memorizing who's the president of

the... Republic of Maldives.

CLAIRE

Mamoon Abdul Gayoom.

ALEX

Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul

Gayeem.

ALEX

And I'm tired of Third World

elevators.

ALEX

Don't leave me.

CLAIRE

I already have.

ALEX

Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I'm

going to Nicaragua with you.

CLAIRE

No.

ALEX

I've heard it's a neat little war

with a nice hotel.

CUT TO:

PRICE

Alex, get up here!

PRICE

To the man who gave me my first job,

and fired me from my first job...

and gave me my second job...

VOICE FROM CROWD

And fired you from your second job...

PRICE

Just a few words, Alex.

VOICES FROM CROWD

Impossible! Can't be done! etc.

ALEX

You may be asking yourself what

exactly are you doing here in this

"strange war, just another chapter

in an endless story... that grinds

into its seventh year..."

CUT TO:

PRICE

Oh. I didn't know you were here.

CLAIRE

Sure you did. You were taking pictures

of me all over the room.

PRICE

Well... yeah... you looked great.

Why aren't you partying?

CLAIRE

In a minute.

PRICE

I printed that up for Alex.

CLAIRE

It wouldn't be the greatest thing

you could give him right now...

(beat)

We just split up.

PRICE

Jesus, I'm sorry. Who left who this

time?

CLAIRE

I'm the villain... I thought it could

be a little cleaner this time -- me

in Central America, him in New York.

PRICE

That's pretty clean.

CLAIRE

But he's decided to go to Nicaragua

too.

PRICE

To cover you or the war?

CLAIRE

To cover everything.

CLAIRE

No.

CLAIRE

For godsakes, Russell, listen.

PRICE

I don't want to wait for you again.

We've been circling each other since

the Montreal Olympics.

CLAIRE

You're a genius of bad timing.

(beat)

I'm going back to the party.

CLAIRE

This is a great shot.

PRICE

Thanks.

CLAIRE

I've heard the light in Nicaragua's

even better.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICARAGUA 1979

PRICE

Wait here.

TEENAGE BOYS

Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o

muerte... Rafael...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALEX

Welcome to Managua.

PRICE

You have something to do with this?

ALEX

Well... I thought of calling your

photographs "Pictures from a Lost

War"... I'm great at captions -- the

New York editors loved it since none

of them knew where the hell Chad was

anyway -- it legitimized their

ignorance, got you a cover, me a

feature, and packaged a class struggle

in two words. Nifty, eh?

PRICE

Nifty.

PRICE

I'm Russell Price.

ALEX

I'm sorry... this is Isela Cruz. She

works for the hotel and helps out as

a translator.

ISELA

My pleasure.

PRICE

(in Spanish)

Looks like you guys have a lot of

bang-bang down here, eh? Little

misunderstanding between the poets

and the government?

ISELA

"Misunderstanding?!" "Down here"

it's called a war. It started in

nineteen thirty. Before you were

born.

ALEX

My Spanish is a little out of shape --

what'd he say?

ISELA

He said he considers it an honor to

be able to photograph our war.

ALEX

Russell's got a way with words.

ISELA

I can tell.

PRICE

You're a helluva translator.

ISELA

I know. I'm much in demand around

here. Will you excuse me? If you

have any questions, just ask.

PRICE

Who is Rafael?

ALEX

It depends who you ask.

ISELA

Rafael? Comandante Rafael. He is

either a Marxist dupe of Russia and

Cuba...

(beat)

...or the most popular leader of a

most popular democratic revolution.

(to Price cynically)

Take your pick.

PRICE

I don't really give a damn... but

the guy's got a great face.

PRICE

How would he like to be photographed?

ISELA

You'd never find him.

PRICE

Wanta lay odds?

ISELA

You would lose.

(beat)

You must excuse me.

PRICE

Just one more thing -- is Rafael

owned by the C.I.A. or the K.G.B.?

I'll figure out the rest.

ISELA

Mr. Price... the world is not divided

into East and West anymore. It is

divided into North and South. By the

time you people figure that out --

it will be too late.

(beat)

Congratulations on your cover.

PRICE

So far this war's got it all over

Africa.

ALEX

You're gonna have a ball.

ALEX

Hands off. I need an interpreter

more than you do right now.

PRICE

You still hanging in there with

Claire?

ALEX

I'm hanging in there like an interim

post-war government waiting for the

palace to be overrun... by younger

men.

PRICE

Younger men.

CLAIRE

Hi, Alex... Russell! When did you

get in?

PRICE

Just now.

CLAIRE

You're not going to believe this --

I just beat you guys and everybody

else here to a story...

(she teases them)

...exclusive... eat your heart out.

PRICE

What'd ya get?

CLAIRE

I've just been promised a private

interview with Tacho.

ALEX

(impressed)

Congratulations. The bastard won't

talk to me.

PRICE

Who's Tacho?

CLAIRE

That's President Somoza's nickname.

PRICE

I don't know who the players are

yet.

ALEX

Want me to order you a hot dog and a

program?

CLAIRE

Fellas! No fighting after six at

night, all right? Curfew.

(beat)

C'mon, we've all got something to

celebrate.

CUT TO:

BOY PHOTOGRAPHER

(in broken English)

Sometimes it doesn't work.

PRICE

Let me look.

DAISY

Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex

ov' here...

ALEX

There's not many piano bars left

where I'm still welcome.

CLAIRE

Go ahead.

ALEX

If she can't sing in the key of C

I'm in trouble.

PRICE

Well...

CLAIRE

"Well"... you finished your assignment

in Chad?

PRICE

Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched

to my editor.

CLAIRE

You're going to love this war,

Russell... there's good guys, bad

guys, cheap shrimp...

(an afterthought)

And Alex is still singing in the

background.

(beat)

I missed you.

PRICE

We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.

ALEX

Sometimes I wonder why I spend these

lonely nights, Dreaming of a song...

CLAIRE

Jesus... he's doing it on purpose.

PRICE

Alex is one of the world's leading

experts on military strategy.

PRICE

Well, hell, I just got off the boat...

gimme the scoop on Nicaragua...

CLAIRE

Well... about sixty years ago the

U.S. Marines invaded to protect

American business interests and put

down a peasant revolt led by a little

man who wore a giant cowboy hat --

his name was Augusto Sandino... In

nineteen thirty-four he was murdered

at a peace conference, and the Somoza

family has ruled ever since...

PRICE

No, no, no... I don't mean the stuff

about the peasants -- I mean the

real stuff.

CLAIRE

The "real" stuff?... you mean a

history of class struggle in agrarian

societies?

PRICE

No, c'mon!

CLAIRE

Oh. Okay... well...

(beat)

Just a couple things.

(beat)

One -- there's only two kinds of

beer available -- Tona and Victoria.

Victoria's better.

(beat)

And two -- if you see Miss Panama

hanging around the hotel bar -- hot,

hot, hot -- but don't touch. She

belongs to Tacho, and if anybody

gets caught with her then El

Presidente has promised to personally

cut off the guy's...

(unsure which word to

use)

PRICE

Pecker?

CLAIRE

Yeah... and throw it into Lake

Managua.

PRICE

Jesus.

CLAIRE

And the lake's already polluted.

PRICE

(mutters to Claire)

Is there anybody here we don't know?

CLAIRE

No.

REGIS

G'damn, Price... kudos on the African

snaps.

(shakes hands, a

perfunctory kiss on

her cheek)

Jeez, Claire, I haven't seen you

since...

CLAIRE

Three Mile Island.

REGIS

Yeah... shit...

(wistfully)

Holiday Inn, right?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and

I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers.

REGIS

Before you fall in love -- that's

Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women,

and Somoza. They say he's a

businessman...

CLAIRE

(interrupting)

He's a businessman in search of a

business... he doesn't try very hard

to cover up his connections to the

C.I.A...

CLAIRE

But look at his moves -- can the

C.I.A. light cigarettes like that?

PRICE

What's wrong with the Everly Brothers?

WAITER

Please stay at your table, and you

won't be hurt.

GUERRILLA LEADER

(in Spanish)

We do not want to waste any ammunition

on a head as empty as yours -- but

we will.

BUSINESSMAN

(in Spanish)

What is this?!

GUERRILLA LEADER

(in Spanish)

Shut up! Get up!

GUERRILLA LEADER

(in Spanish)

You are coming with us -- you will

not be hurt -- we will trade you for

the release of some Nicaraguans who

care about Nicaragua.

CUT TO:

TIME STRINGER

...it's Charlie, from New York --

says that a terrorist bombing of a

Central American restaurant isn't

big enough to hold for the world

section...

ALEX

Tell him we have pictures.

YOUNG JOURNALIST

He knows.

ALEX

Tell him there were pieces of body

in the piano, and somebody was

singing, "I Left My Heart in San

Francisco."

(beat)

What's he got better than that?

TIME STRINGER

He's got the Pope visiting Egypt.

ALEX

Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week

you got the Pope somewhere. This is

a very big story down here because

it's the first sign of fighting in

Managua.

(beat)

Yeah, well get a map and look up

Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans

and turn left.

ALEX

Like hell I'm editorializing, the

whole thing happened in a roomful of

C.I.A. and press. What do you want?!

(beats)

How do I know they were C.I.A.? They

wore name tags, what do you think?

We're backing a Fascist again -- I

know that ain't news, but see if you

can find an angle!

HUB

Hey! There's fascists and then there's

fascists, right? Be careful how you

throw words like that around.

ALEX

We don't have any pictures of Rafael

because nobody knows where the son

of a bitch is, and anybody crazy

enough to go after him...

ALEX

...is liable to get his nuts shot

off.

ALEX

Yeah, well g'bye...

(to Hub)

Who the fuck are you?

HUB

(extending a hand)

Hub Kittle. I'm with Lewitsky and

Knupp -- New York. We have a client

down here.

ALEX

Who?

HUB

President Somoza.

HUB

I know, I know...

(beat)

But there's an untold story here. I

mean, the man has a point of view

too, right?

HUB

We got a national anthem contest

going on right now, and you guys are

ignoring it. Lotta human interest.

CLAIRE

I want you to get me copies of the

Government inventory lists of all

captured Guerrilla weapons. I want

to know if the guns are Israeli,

Belgian, Russian, Cuban...

YOUNG WOMAN

The Guerrillas are not supplied by

anybody from the outside.

CLAIRE

Fine -- give me proof.

OPERATOR

Su hija, su hija! Your daughter from

Los Angeles.

CLAIRE

Hi, baby! How are you?

(beat)

Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by

now? She has? Good.

(beats)

Yes, I got your letter with the

picture of your new boyfriend. He's

very good looking... but he's a bit

old, isn't he? No? Just how old is

he?...

CUT TO:

PRICE

(in broken Spanish)

Cuanto?

OLD WOMAN

Quince.

PRICE

Veinte.

OLD WOMAN

Diezysiete.

PRICE

What is this? I'm a journalist!

PRICE

Journalista, journalista!

CUT TO:

GUARD

Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta...

(in Spanish to Price)

Here is a Priest for you to confess

your sins.

PRISONER PRIEST

Cigarillo?

PRICE

Priest?

(the man nods)

(in broken Spanish)

What are you doing here?

PRISONER PRIEST

(in Spanish)

The government accused me of using

the church to hide Rebels and guns.

PRICE

(in Spanish)

Governments are always wrong, eh?

PRISONER PRIEST

(in Spanish)

This time they're right. Who are

you?

PRICE

(in Spanish)

Un periodista.

PRISONER PRIEST

(in Spanish)

Whose side are you on?

PRICE

(in Spanish)

I don't take sides. I take pictures.

PRISONER PRIEST

(in Spanish)

No sides?

PRICE

(in Spanish)

No.

PRISONER PRIEST

Periodista Puta, todos periodistas

son putas.

(All journalists are

whores)

PRISONER PRIEST

(quietly)

Go home.

CUT TO:

PRICE

Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh?

Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time

magazine.

SOLDIER

(in Spanish)

Shut up!

PRICE

Soy un periodista.

SENIOR GUARD OFFICER

(in excellent English)

Mr. Price... you must accept our

deepest apologies for the

misunderstanding. Somebody saw you

taking photographs of terrorists

hooligans in the parade and at the

nightclub -- our young officers get

carried away... they're always looking

for traitors.

PRICE

That film is half way to New York by

now.

SENIOR GUARD OFFICER

I know, I know... It was all a

misunderstanding... una mala

interpretacion. Your cameras.

SENIOR GUARD OFFICER

I'm sorry.

PRICE

Forget it.

SENIOR GUARD OFFICER

This way.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

You throw a journalist in jail -- it

gets in the papers. You walk all

over the same press credentials you

pass out. I demand to speak to someone

in authority or I'll go to Tacho

myself... I don't understand you --

you're big and strong and handsome

but you're not so smart!

(beat)

You should be trying to seduce us!

OFFICER

Senora...

PRICE

Claire!

CLAIRE

You're okay?

PRICE

I'm fine -- what're you doing here?

These guys are goons.

CLAIRE

They love being beaten up by a woman

(beat)

I've been looking for you all night --

why'd they lock you up?

PRICE

I don't know. Taking pictures. The

usual. Jazy got me released.

CLAIRE

Jazy?! You think there's a story

there?

PRICE

Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike.

I wanta find Rafael.

CLAIRE

You need help?

PRICE

No. You?

CLAIRE

No.

(beat)

When should we start.

PRICE

I figure you probably want to do a

little research on the history of

Marcel Jazy's business connections

in the third world countries with

C.I.A. influence...

CLAIRE

Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in

the eye and say "Gimme a break, for

crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or

aren't you?"

CUT TO:

PRICE

...are you a spy or aren't you, eh?

JAZY

(smiling)

Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price...

nobody is a... 'spy'... anymore.

CLAIRE

Russell prefers pictures to words...

JAZY

You don't have to apologize... you're

journalists.

CLAIRE

And you're a businessman?

JAZY

A businessman? That sounds good.

Okay, I'm a businessman.

PRICE

Why was I arrested, and why did you

get me released, and who are you?

WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT

No agua.

JAZY

(nodding)

No agua.

WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT

(in Spanish)

Oh, Marcel! You told me there would

be water in the pool this week!

JAZY

If she dove in, I assure you she

wouldn't notice.

JAZY

(to Miss Panama in

Spanish)

Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked

out the pumping station on the road

to Masaya, and we must ration water

for the time being. Next week maybe

things will be better.

WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT

(in Spanish)

Maybe I should go back to Panama.

JAZY

(in Spanish)

Maybe you should.

JAZY

You were arrested because the Guardia

are clowns who specialize in excess.

You were released because I told

them to release you.

CLAIRE

These are not the normal duties of a

businessman.

JAZY

But they are the normal duties of

a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy.

(smiles)

There, are you happy? I feel better.

JAZY

Now we can relax. You can turn off

your little thing.

JAZY

Oh, I trust you won't say anything

to hurt me. In some ways I'm a

terrible spy. I used to be much better

at it, but now it seems everyone

knows who I am. I have too many

girlfriends. I like to be

photographed.

(beat)

I talk too much.

JAZY

I always talk too much... but my

girlfriends like that... No matter.

(pointing to the

swimsuited woman)

You know who she is?

CLAIRE AND PRICE

No.

JAZY

That's Miss Panama. Do you know who

that is?

CLAIRE AND PRICE

Oh, yeah, yes, etc.

JAZY

She's in love with me. I've got to

get some water in the pool.

(beat)

And once a week I have lunch with

President Somoza to discuss security

measures against the Sandinista

insurgents, but all he wants to talk

about is Miss Panama... he's worried

about her.

CLAIRE

Because he thinks she's seeing another

man?

JAZY

...and he assigned me to find out

who the man is.

JAZY

We all know the Revolutionaries are

going to win, don't we?

PRICE

There's a rumor about this picture.

Some people say you're a genius --

that you invented this scheme.

JAZY

It was lots of people's idea... Have

you been to Leon?

CLAIRE

We're going to Masaya... they say

the Rebels have hit the cuartel.

PRICE

It's supposed to be nasty there... a

lotta people think Rafael's in the

South. I want to find out.

JAZY

No, no, it's not "nasty" yet. Another

week maybe.

(beat)

You would love Leon. A nice cathedral

and beautiful light... et un peu de

bang-bang.

CLAIRE

We're not doing a travelogue, you

understand.

JAZY

Of course, of course... only I have

heard that Comandante Rafael has

recently had his unit in the area.

PRICE

(surprised)

Rafael is near Leon?

JAZY

Well... it's a rumor, what do I know?

MISS PANAMA

Estoy desemperado!

JAZY

She's lonely!

CLAIRE

Don't let us stand in the way.

JAZY

It's my job.

(beat)

You think I talk too much?

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Did you dream about Miss Panama last

night?

PRICE

I dreamed about you.

CLAIRE

Have a good time?

PRICE

Yeah... so'd you.

CLAIRE

And old war injury flaring up?

PRICE

Is the tape on?

CLAIRE

Of course.

PRICE

I was on the deck of the U.S.S. Pueblo

catching some rays when the North

Koreans attacked... took a bullet

right in the chest, but by luck I

had an extra roll of high speed

ektachrome in this pocket right

here... over the heart...

CLAIRE

And the bullet ricocheted off the

film, grazed your cheek, and saved

your life.

PRICE

You heard about it?! I was lucky.

CLAIRE

Did anyone ever die next to you in

combat?

PRICE

Yeah.

CLAIRE

What did you do?

PRICE

F.8 at a sixtieth.

CLAIRE

That's an old joke. My question was

serious.

PRICE

So was I.

(beat)

You ever dream about me?

CLAIRE

Once.

PRICE

How was I?

CLAIRE

Fast.

CLAIRE

I'm basically a coward, Russell, I

hope you understand that. I hope we

don't get shot.

PRICE

Me too.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

(to soldier in Spanish)

I thought it was quiet here.

SOLDIER

(in Spanish)

Quiet? Are you sure you want to go

down there? Not me.

SOLDIER

(in Spanish)

You must leave the car here.

PRICE

(to soldier)

You thinking of scoring a Toyota?

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

No problem -- we leave the car.

CLAIRE

Now what?

PRICE

C'mon. Be careful.

CLAIRE

Be careful?! Where the fuck we going?

Better light?

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

...June tenth... the evacuation of

Leon... a woman carries a pig...

signs for the F.S.L.N. are

everywhere... a body...

CLAIRE

Russell?!

SANDINISTA #1

(in Spanish)

You must come and help us... one

more time.

PEDRO

(in Spanish)

No, please...

SANDINISTA #2

(in Spanish)

For Leon... for Nicaragua!

PEDRO

Americans? Journalists?

CLAIRE AND PRICE

Yes.

PEDRO

Ah! I put my autograph on this ball.

SANDINISTA #1

(in Spanish)

Pedro! There is no time to waste.

PEDRO

When you get back to the United

States, I want you to give this ball

to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from

Nicaragua.

SANDINISTA #1

(in Spanish)

Enrique is dead! Roberto has

disappeared! The Guardia has the

church, and we need you!

PEDRO

(to Claire and Price)

You come, eh?

(to the Sandinistas)

Can they come with us?

SANDINISTA #2

Come! Everybody come!

CUT TO:

No, please... it's not safe. You

Awright, awright -- you're lookin'

Shitload o' greasers though, eh?

SANDINISTA #1

It's getting late -- come on.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

You're okay?

SANDINISTA #1

San-dee Koufax, no?

SANDINISTA #2

Si, Koufax.

SANDINISTA #3

Es mejor que Koufax, eh?!

CLAIRE

Much better than Koufax.

PEDRO

Koufax is okay... but Tippy Martinez,

he is the best... he pitches for the

Baltimore Orioles, and some day I

will be the second man from Nicaragua

to play in the major leagues...

SANDINISTA #1

(to Price and Claire)

Tippy Martinez had a good fastball,

but Pedro has a curveball and a

screwball that are better.

PEDRO

You will give my autographed baseball

to Tippy and tell him in five years

I will be pitching with him, okay?

He better watch out for me, eh?

CUT TO:

SANDINISTA #1

(in Spanish)

It's too dangerous to return to

Managua at night. You should stay at

the house of hammocks.

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

Gracias. Can they get into trouble

for keeping us?

PEDRO

No, no... you are not combatants.

(would rather talk

baseball)

The Baltimore team is my team...

PRICE

You bastard!

CLAIRE

What about him?!

SANDINISTA #1

(dispassionately)

He's dead.

SANDINISTA #1

I will talk to Pedro's mother. You

must go to the house of the hammocks

if you want to be safe.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Hello sweetheart, this is your mother.

I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't

worry about me -- it's not dangerous

at all. I guess you can't believe

what you hear on the news. I'll put

this this tape in the mail when I

get back to Managua, but knowing

what the mail service is like, I may

be home before it arrives. I think

about you all the time and hope I

can make it back before you graduate

from Jr. High.

CLAIRE

I love you and I'll finish this letter

when I get back to the hotel.

PRICE

I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody

was in the tower.

CLAIRE

Why didn't you tell the guerrillas?

PRICE

I don't know... then they would've

killed him I guess. I didn't want to

interfere.

CLAIRE

It wasn't an easy choice.

PRICE

I think I made the wrong one.

CLAIRE

You didn't take any pictures when it

was over.

PRICE

I didn't?

(beat)

I picked up a gun. Jesus.

CLAIRE

Yes.

Are you asleep?

CLAIRE

No.

DISSOLVE TO:

G'morning.

CLAIRE

What are you doing?

You look beautiful.

CLAIRE

How long have you been doing this?

PRICE

'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see

the pictures -- you look great.

CLAIRE

I'll bet I look great -- give me the

film.

PRICE

After they're printed.

CLAIRE

I'll develop them myself -- give it

to me or I'll start taping what you

say in your sleep.

I talk in my sleep?

Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible.

Oh!

ALEX

Oh.

How was Leon?

CLAIRE

Bloody.

ALEX

Yeah... I'll bet... Claire...

ALEX

I'm tired of Nicaragua.

CLAIRE

You haven't been here very long.

ALEX

Long enough, lets face it, you were

right... everybody was right.

CLAIRE

About what?

ALEX

My cheekbones. What do you think of

'em?

CLAIRE

I like your cheekbones. Alex, are

you all right?

ALEX

This is a face made for television.

CLAIRE

You decided to go with the network.

ALEX

Is he a good fuck?

CLAIRE

Alex...

ALEX

That's a reasonable question for a

reporter to ask, isn't it?!

(beat)

I shoulda never come down here, eh?

This is the way it's going to be.

(beat)

I'll make a shitload of money in

television for just sitting there.

(beat)

I'm gonna show up to work at

Rockefeller Center every morning and

they're gonna hand me the news with

my coffee and toast.

I shoulda never come down here, eh?

This war down here belongs to you

guys, okay? I'm on tommorrow's plane.

CLAIRE

Alex...

ALEX

You want to take me to the airport?

It's okay.

I shoulda never come down here.

Take this to check in. I'll be right

there.

Sniff this sucker, eh?

ALEX

Jesus, where'd you get this?

CLAIRE

The C.I.A.

ALEX

Where else.

PRICE

Hey -- I'll leave you guys alone,

eh?

CLAIRE

No, no, don't be ridiculous.

ALEX

We're grownups, Russell...

(non acerbically)

Most of us.

You two wanta happy snap?

ALEX

No happy snaps.

Okay, okay...

I'll just... be over here.

ALEX

You're sure about him?

CLAIRE

For the moment.

I'm a personal friend of Tacho's.

Don't look, huh?

No mire!

ALEX

Don't get hurt.

Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry.

Alex, listen to me...

ALEX

Yeah?

PRICE

Within a year you're gonna be one of

the "Ten Most Admired Men in America."

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

You're late to your own luncheon,

Mr. President -- we can schedule

this for another time.

SOMOZA

Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a

stunning couple, eh? My stomach is

very flat -- I've been working out.

CLAIRE

We are a stunning couple. Mr.

President, you own one fifth of all

the land in Nicaragua, you own the

shipping port, the national airlines,

the Mercedes dealership...

SOMOZA

I am on a salt free diet...

CLAIRE

Do you always hold hands with

reporters?

SOMOZA

(ignores her)

This is my mother and father. They

were very special to me. Every Sunday

morning I drive out to the cemetery

and put flowers on their grave. I

think people should know that.

CLAIRE

Would you care to comment on the

fall of Leon to the rebels?

CUT TO:

HUB

Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's

very easy to fall in love with the

underdog, eh? But there's an upside

and downside to this thing -- just

wanta remind you... this stuff about

a "Revolution of Poets" is crap.

PRICE

But it's great P.R. So what's the

upside?

HUB

Simple. And it could happen. Somoza

destroys the terrorist insurgents,

rebuilds the country, shitcans the

purveyors of excess, stabilizes the

cordoba, and is finally beloved as

the savior of Nicaragua.

(beat)

Our pal. Got a smoke?

PRICE

What's the downside?

HUB

The Commies take over the world.

HUB

Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war

may be over.

CUT TO:

SOMOZA

My people love me. My stomach is

flat. Did I say that already? No

matter. It is flat.

CLAIRE

There are reports that the Guardia

operates a torture chamber at

Coyotepe.

SOMOZA

I like this song.

CLAIRE

Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed

half of Managua, over three hundred

million dollars in foreign relief

aid have poured into the country,

yet nothing has been re-built. It is

said that the money has gone into

your pocket.

SOMOZA

I love the press, I really do. Some

of my best friends are journalists.

CLAIRE

Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and

Panama are reportedly on the verge

of breaking off diplomatic relations

with your regime. Would you comment?

SOMOZA

(in Spanish)

I am busy! Get out of here at once

or I'll put my foot up your ass!

SOMOZA

(to Claire)

I'm sorry to have to conclude this

most pleasant encounter, but something

has happened.

HUB

Did he tell you about his parents in

the graveyard, the flowers and all

that?

(she nods)

Good, good...

CUT TO:

SOMOZA

My friends... this gathering was not

intended to be a press conference as

much as a... "get-together"... but I

have just been handed a piece of

news.

SOMOZA

Rafael is dead.

(beat)

He has been killed in an ambush in

the Cordillera mountains of the

Jinotega district.

JOURNALISTS

Mr. President! Mr. President!

SOMOZA

Please my friends -- no questions. A

press release is being prepared.

OTHER JOURNALIST

They got Rafael? You believe that?

REGIS

Every six months Tacho gives this

speech -- maybe they finally lucked

out.

JAZY

Russell, excuse me... but I've just

been put in a rather embarrassing

position.

(hesitates)

Mrs. Somoza would like her picture

taken with Miss Panama. In color?

PRICE

How the hell could Tacho find Rafael.

JAZY

Russell, please... I have my hands

full...

MRS. SOMOZA

Tacho, Tacho... venga, por favor!

PRICE

Is Tacho lying again? They did kill

him, didn't they?

JAZY

Everybody smile.

PRICE

One more, please! Una mas, por favor?

PRICE

We help each other, right? Could you

move your girlfriend into the sun...

JAZY

What do you need?

PRICE

Is Rafael alive or dead?

JAZY

I don't know.

PRICE

(to the posers)

Just one more -- thank you.

(to Jazy)

I thought you knew everything?

JAZY

What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a

victory very badly... he needs to

prove to Jimmy Carter that he is

still winning. He thinks Rafael's

death is the proof he needs.

PRICE

Carter don't need proof. He just

sent twenty-five million in new arms

to Tacho.

(to posers)

I'm sorry... almost got it here.

JAZY

No, no... the arms shipment has been

delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy

is getting nervous.

PRICE

The State Department's gonna pull

the plug on Tacho?! Pardon my French --

but whose fucking side are you on?

JAZY

...I work for everybody. If there is

a transition of power, I facilitate

a relationship with the new people.

If there is not, I facilitate the

status quo.

(beat)

Either way, I facilitate.

PRICE

Great job.

JAZY

I send messages to Jimmy and I tell

him that the Revolution is a flood

that cannot be stopped but it can be

controlled... nobody listens... I

can't even get a little water in my

pool.

PRICE

Rough ain't it. Thank you everybody,

very nice.

PRICE

I don't think Rafael is dead. I'm

gonna find him.

JAZY

They say he's very handsome.

(beat)

It would make a wonderful picture,

eh?

Con permiso -- who controls what

RED CROSS WORKER

The Sandinistas hold the hills, the

Guardia has everything else.

CLAIRE

How do we find the guerillas?

RED CROSS WORKER

(points)

Va alli, dos o tres cuartos, doble

la esquina al francotirador.

REGIS

What'd he say?

CLAIRE

Go two or three blocks and turn right

at the sniper.

PRICE

You can drop us off.

PRICE

Wrong way!

REGIS

We're not looking for the guerillas.

CLAIRE

Then let us out.

SOLDIER

Lo siento!

(I'm sorry!)

PRICE

Go one more block.

He just wanted to see credentials,

for crissakes, what're doing?

You want to drive?

We want out!

Si.

Venga.

CUT TO:

ISELA

You are looking for Rafael?

PRICE

Yeah. If it's possible.

CLAIRE

Do you know why we're here... exactly?

ISELA

Mr. Price doesn't do anything before

announcing it first in the bar.

(beat)

It's a good story. You'll be more

famous.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Rafael's tent?

ISELA

Venga, companeros.

(Come, comrades.)

CLAIRE

What is it?

PRICE

Rafael is dead.

PRICE

I can smell it.

CLAIRE

I don't know.

ISELA

(slightly exasperated)

Venga por favor! Alli!

CLAIRE

What're you talking about?

PRICE

He's dead. I know it.

CLAIRE

Then why did they bring us all the

way here to see him?

ISELA

This is Commandante Cinco.

ISELA

Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is

about to fall, and Masaya. And next

week we could be in Managua but it

is still possible to lose.

(beat)

In the last days of our final

offensive the people of Nicaragua

must know that Rafael is alive and

well.

COMMANDANTE CINCO

Queremos un fotografia.

ISELA

We need a photograph.

(beat)

Come with us.

COMMANDANTE CINCO

Usted es un fotografo magnifico.

(beat)

Queremos que vive.

(You are a great

photographer. Make

him alive.)

ISELA

(to Claire)

Why is he laughing?

PRICE

You're crazy.

CINCO

(in Spanish)

We have momentum, but many more lives

will be lost. Even Washington is

starting to admit that the butcher

Somoza is not loved by his people.

They have detained twenty-five million

dollars in new arms shipments for

Somoza at an airfield in Florida

until they find out if Rafael is

alive or dead. We know about these

things.

CLAIRE

If Washington thinks Rafael is dead,

they will ship the arms to Somoza.

Do you understand.

PRICE

Yeah.

(without enthusiasm)

Commandante... Soy un periodista.

CINCO

This has nothing to do with journalism --

there is more to the world than

journalism. We are going to end this

war with you or without you.

(beat)

People don't really believe in Rafael --

they believe in the idea of Rafael,

no? Because for now the idea of Rafael

is enough for the people of Nicaragua.

When the war is over -- none of this

matters.

PRICE

I don't do things... like this.

CINCO

Enough lives have been lost already.

(beat of empathy)

It's difficult, I know -- but you

must do it.

CINCO

In the morning, eh? When there's

better light!

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

I spend my whole life separating how

I feel from how I think and what I

see from what I say -- that's called

journalism, isn't it?

CLAIRE

It's disciplined. It civilized. It

involves distinctions. I'm great at

distinctions. I wish I wasn't so

good at them. Sometimes I envy you --

you don't make any -- it's very

convenient.

(beat)

The only time I don't worry about

all those things is when I'm with my

daughter.

PRICE

Or when you're in bed.

CLAIRE

Yes!

(beat -- changes

direction)

My job is to find a story, then tell

a story -- whatever it is -- because

I believe that if enough people hear

enough stories then somehow, through

information alone, we all have a

better chance to survive.

(beat)

I believe in information.

(beat)

That's a very romantic streak I have

running through me -- maybe it's a

weakness. Information is good --

lack of information is bad. Simple,

eh?

PRICE

Not so simple.

CLAIRE

You're God damn right it's not.

(beat)

You take that picture you'll take it

for all the right reasons -- I

understand.

PRICE

I'm not gonna take it.

CLAIRE

That's fine for you. But do I go

back and say I interviewed Rafael?

Do I go back and say I missed the

biggest story of the war? Or do I

say Rafael was stone cold dead --

that's the information, isn't it? Or

do I say he entertained us all in

his inimitably charismatic manner

around the ol' revolutionary campfire?

(beat)

Can we throw up our arms and say we

fell in love with the querillas

because their cause was...

sympathetic?

(beat)

Journalists don't fall in love.

(beat)

Which story do you want me to tell?

PRICE

Do what you want to do.

CLAIRE

Christ, what the fuck are we doing

here?

PRICE

I want to be here.

(beat)

With you.

(beat)

What do you want.

CLAIRE

I want this war to end.

I'm not going to tell the world that

Rafael is dead.

It's fabulous.

Well, yes... it's fabulous.

Fabulous.

CLAIRE

Why are you back?

ALEX

I came back because of Russell.

PRICE

Because of me?

ALEX

Yeah... the whole fucking East Coast

is falling in love with Rafael --

they were sure he was dead this time.

Somebody wants to do a musical about

him and his mug's on every T-shirt

I think he's bigger than Farrah

Fawcett.

You look good. Things're okay?

I'm happier in New York, sure, things

Terrific... now... I'm a little slow

We've got to tell Alex what happened.

No way.

I'll tell him. He deserves to know.

We don't owe him anything!

CLAIRE

We owe him that!

He got you started in this business...

he covered for your missed deadlines

unprofessional attitude before the

world fell in love with your

pictures...

school were rushing off to any war

they could to interview bullets and

take pictures of bodies -- like Price!

(beat)

He took care of you before you were

hot!

PRICE

He wouldn't understand.

CLAIRE

Before Nicaragua you wouldn't

understand. I'm not sure I exactly

understand.

(beat)

What are we going to do?

PRICE

I'll take Alex to find Rafael --

we'll go to Sebaco on the road to

Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily

control the area and they're scared

right now -- they'll never let us

through. We won't be able to get

near Rafael. Alex will understand --

and we'll turn around and drive back

without a story.

CLAIRE

That's a lie!

Tell me about lies!

I don't want to tell him either.

You think our flags are big enough?

PRICE

This is what I want to show you.

ALEX

We drove through three roadblocks a

half hour before curfew so you could

show me a statue of Tacho.

PRICE

It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. Tacho

went to Italy to commission a statue

of himself, he found a warehouse

full of Il Duces on horseback, got a

great deal on one of 'em -- brought

it back and switched heads.

(beat)

Ya can't tell, can ya?

ALEX

What the hell are you talking about?

CLAIRE

I think what he's trying to say --

what we're trying to say -- is that

things aren't exactly what they seem

to be.

ALEX

Well, they don't "seem" to be that

great so I can't wait for this one...

(mocks silliness)

Hey, here we are! Two guys in the

tropics in love with the same dame...

bullets flying!

Oh yeah? I left the country because

You saw too many bodies? That's a

lot of bodies.

You stupid son of a bitch.

Did he talk you into it?

CLAIRE

No! I wanted Rafael to be alive.

ALEX

In some way I understand him doing

it, I don't like it but I

understand... but you?

CLAIRE

I'd do it again.

ALEX

You two have, of course, just served

me up your balls -- if that's what

they're called -- on a platter.

I can bury you both. You're handing

me your careers.

Well, Jesus Christ... this is a

motherfucking story, Russell...

What am I supposed to do with it?

CLAIRE

Anything you want.

ALEX

They're holding the lead in the World

It's great stuff, isn't it? We'd go

down in a blaze of glory.

Oh yeah...

I don't know what to do.

I've gotta take some kind of a story

back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh?

CLAIRE

Oh Jesus.

It's a little dangerous looking for

Jazy at the moment.

ALEX

(mock heroic)

Ah, danger -- I love it. You could

ask the pointy-shoed little bastard

about your pictures... and I could

ask him whatever happened to Isela.

CLAIRE

She's an officer in the Rafael army --

we saw her in Matagalpa.

ALEX

You mean I slept with a Sandinista?

ALEX

I guess Rafael is alive, eh?

CUT TO:

PRICE

Damn air conditioning.

CLAIRE

I wish I was home.

PRICE

C'mere.

CLAIRE

Do you think it's almost over?

CUT TO:

PRICE

Alex... let's go back.

ALEX

Jazy's probably sitting in the bar

laughing at us. Which way's the hotel?

PRICE

I don't know.

ALEX

I'll ask her... be right back.

PRICE

Just a sec'... take a flag.

PRICE

You fucks! You fucks!

GUARDIA SOLDIER

Fotografia!

CUT TO:

SOMOZA

It is with grave concern that we

announce that Alexander Grazier,

senior American correspondent, has

been murdered at the hands of

terrorists...

SOMOZA

Mr. Kittle has prepared statements

for you.

REGIS

Get my bill and get me a cab, hey,

amigo!

CLERK

No cabs.

REGIS

Cabs!

CLERK

No cabs!

REGIS

I'm sorry, Claire...

CLAIRE

Heard from Russell?

REGIS

Nobody has.

CLAIRE

Wanta help me find him?

REGIS

Claire... it's on the weird side out

there...

HUB

Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy,

what can I say?

CLAIRE

Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

Do you know where the American

journalist was killed?

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

Have you seen him?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOMAN

(in Spanish)

This is the best I can offer.

PRICE

Gracias.

CUT TO:

SOLDIER

Venga aqui.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

(in Spanish)

Nobody is here. Get out.

LEADER

Esta alli?!

(Is he there?)

LEADER

Esta alli?!

BOY SOLDIER

No esta aqui.

GUARDIA OFFICER

(in Spanish)

We are you! We are you! What are you

doing?!

CLAIRE

Russell!

PRICE

What're you doing here?!

CLAIRE

Alex!

PRICE

The Guardia did it -- I got pictures.

CUT TO:

PRICE

Hola.

(the Guerrillas nod;

in Spanish)

Do you control this area?

DISCO SANDINISTA

(in Spanish)

I don't know.

CUT TO:

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Who are you?

JAZY

They are my friends.

MUCHACHO #2

(in Spanish)

Shut up. We kill them all.

MUCHACHO #3

(in Spanish)

No. Only him.

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Him or him or her?

JAZY

Well, here we are, eh?

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Assassin! Shut up!

JAZY

The boys are confused -- they think

I had their family killed.

PRICE

You murder people.

JAZY

"Murder" is a word for criminals. I

have a job to protect the stability

of a continent.

MUCHACHO #3

Pig! Hijo de puta!

JAZY

Please...

CLAIRE

You got caught by some boys?

JAZY

Yes. Poets too, I imagine.

(beat)

Is your recorder on?

CLAIRE

(hesitates)

Yes.

JAZY

Good. I have a speech to make.

JAZY

I like you people, but you are

sentimental shits. You fall in love

with the poets, the poets fall in

love with the Marxists, the Marxists

fall in love with themselves. The

country is destroyed with rhetoric,

and in the end we are stuck with

tyrants.

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Shut up!

JAZY

Un minuto, por favor.

MUCHACHO #2

(to Price and Claire,

more calmly)

Who are you?

JAZY

(in Spanish)

They are journalists.

MUCHACHO #1

Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm

going to blow his head off.

JAZY

Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course.

A butcher.

(beat)

But finally that is not the point,

you see. If we wish to survive -- we

have a choice of tyrants, and for

all the right reasons, your poets

choose the wrong side.

MUCHACHO #1

(impatiently)

Fotografia!

PRICE

No.

JAZY

Yes.

(beat)

Your picture of Rafael was

brilliant... but I am alive, and

better looking. A good looking

Frenchman with a sympathetic face is

murdered in cold blood while fighting

for the survival of Europe and

America.

(beat)

You will have another magazine cover!

(smiles)

Muy complicado, no?

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Ready! Now!

CLAIRE

You picked the wrong side.

JAZY

In fifty years we will know who's

right.

(beat)

Are you going to take the picture as

the bullet enters the skull or as it

comes out? This wall's a nice color,

eh? I can move into the sunlight.

JAZY

(to Claire)

It's just a story!

MUCHACHO #1

(in Spanish)

Shut up!

JAZY

They say that if somebody's holding

a gun on you, you should never stop

talking... that's the theory -- who

knows?...

JAZY

Maybe it's a good thing that I talk

too much...

CLAIRE

You okay?

(he nods)

Russell... what did Alex do?

PRICE

Nothing. He asked for directions.

PRICE

We gotta get outta sight -- half the

fucking army's looking for me...

CLAIRE

They're not looking for me.

CLAIRE

Let me have the film...

(beat; unsure)

...if I can't get to the hotel I'll

come back here...

PRICE

Aw, Christ...

(frustrated)

I've wrecked everything else, at

least let me take care of you here.

CLAIRE

Russell... it's more dangerous being

with you than being alone.

PRICE

Don't get hurt.

CLAIRE

(affectionately)

That's great advice.

DOCTOR

Journalist?

(Claire nods)

You knew the man who was killed?

(she nods again)

Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have

died... and now one Yankee.

(beat)

Perhaps now Americans will be outraged

at what is happening here, eh?

CLAIRE

Yes... perhaps they will.

DOCTOR

Maybe we should have killed an

American journalist fifty years ago.

Have you seen La Guardia?

WOMAN WITH CHILDREN

(in Spanish)

No. Is the war over?

CLAIRE

(in Spanish)

I don't know.

CHILD

Tanquettas! Tanquettas!

WOMAN WITH CHILDREN

Is the war over?

CLAIRE

Yes.

WOMAN WITH CHILDREN

Es bueno.

(It is good.)

VOICE OF HUB KITTLE

It was the best I would do under the

circumstances. The casket, I mean.

CLAIRE

Can you help us ship it home?

HUB

I've already taken care of it.

(beat)

I always liked the guy. I can't even

get tickets for my own family, but I

could get you two on the plane if

you want.

PRICE

Yes, please...

HUB

Tacho's in Miami.

HUB'S DAUGHTER

Daddy!

HUB

(to Price and Claire)

I am sorry. I had a job to do --

that's all -- it put me in some

unhappy situations.

CUT TO:

OATES

Hey, Pricey...

OATES

It's all over, eh? We made it. I

like the singing.

PRICE

What're you doing here?

OATES

Free country. Now it's free, anyway.

(raises his drink)

Nicalibre!

OATES

How 'bout a quickie?

(no response)

No? Things are heating up in

Thailand... thought I'd check it

out.

(beat)

You ain't gonna turn me in, are ya?

OATES

Am I gonna see ya in Thailand? We

could be friends!

PRICE

We've got a plane to catch.

CLAIRE

Did you get enough pictures?
