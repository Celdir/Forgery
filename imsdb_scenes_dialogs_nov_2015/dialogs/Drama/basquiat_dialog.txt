VOICE (O.S.)

Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh

boat. There's no trip so horrible that

someone won't take it. The idea of the

unrecognized genius slaving away in a

garret is a deliciously foolish one. We

must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh

for really sending this myth into orbit.

How many pictures did he sell? One? He

couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed

of his life that the rest of art history

will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect.

No one wants to be part of a generation

that ignores another Van Gogh.

RENE (CONT'D)

(sighing theatrically)

In this town one is at the mercy of the

recognition factor. One's public

appearance is absolute.

RENE (CONT'D)

I consider myself a metaphor of the public.

I am a public eye. I am a witness.

DISSOLVE TO:

RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)

Part of the artist's job is to get the work

where I will see it.

RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)

When you first see a new picture, you don't

want to miss the boat. You have to be very

careful because you may be staring at Van

Gogh's ear.

WAITRESS

What'll it be?

BASQUIAT

Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together

in peace. What's her name?

(indicates Gina)

WAITRESS

Gina. What'll it be?

BASQUIAT

Pancakes.

BENNY

Hey - Willie Mays.

BASQUIAT

Willie Mays.

RENE

Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu

burger. Rapido!

GINA

We don't serve that - amigo.

RENE

Fine... A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and

a vodka.

BASQUIAT

(under his breath)

Who's that?

BENNY

The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic -

writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell

him who you are..

BASQUIAT

Who am I?

BENNY

SAMO.

BASQUIAT

Oh yeah..

CUSTOMER

How's the special today?

GINA

It's your stomach.

BASQUIAT

Hey.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

What do you think?

GINA

It's me. I've never been done in maple

syrup. Here's a rag.

BASQUIAT

(gently)

Gina?

LESHKO

Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl,

making a mess.

BASQUIAT

How about those pancakes?

LESHKO

OK! Goodbye!

GINA

Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.

LESHKO

You nuts? Let him order? You on his side?

You're not such a good waitress. You get

out, too.

GINA

I just don't think you're being fair.

LESHKO

I need this?

GINA

I need this?

BENNY

(waving g'bye to Jean)

Willie Mays.

LESHKO

(to Gina)

That's right. You go with them. Make babies

the government has to pay for.

CUT TO:

BENNY

Catch you later.

GINA

What's a job, anyway?

(pause)

What's wrong with you?

GINA (CONT'D)

No, don't tell me - you just got fired by

your crazy boss.

BASQUIAT

I guess you did.

GINA

Guess I just got sick of him.

BASQUIAT

Can I walk you home?

GINA

I think I could do that alone.

BASQUIAT

Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd

Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the

list.

GINA

I hate the Mudd Club.

GINA (CONT'D)

Have you been camping? You could use a

scrub.

BASQUIAT

I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I

don't know why, I just do!

GINA

(smelling)

You do! You definitely do.

BASQUIAT

Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.

GINA

I don't go there. Too many party girls.

BASQUIAT

Party girls? Can I call you?

GINA

(teasing him)

Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496.

BASQUIAT

Here, this is for you. I made this.

GINA

Thanks.

BASQUIAT

Hey, mom.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

I met the girl I'm gonna marry.

MATILDE

Do you like it here?

BASQUIAT

I'd like it better in Hawaii.

BASQUIAT

"She loves me.

Oh yeah she loves me!

She loooooooves me,

Oh yeah she loves me!"

Bring me some chicken, baby!

BENNY

Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what

I'm doing?

BASQUIAT

Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great,

Benny.

(goes back into 'act')

"Her name is G-I-N-A Gina

And she lo-oooves me."

I did say chicken!

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

I knew I left these somewhere. One of

these'll send your kids to college someday.

(hands it to Benny solemnly)

Here - I made this for you.

BENNY

Thanks.

(beat)

Your dad called again - something about a

job.

BENNY (CONT'D)

You got a date already?

BASQUIAT

(exhaling)

We're getting married. She said she could

tell I was a great artist - she could see

it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by

my side and have inter-racial babies with

me.

BENNY

G'night... See you in court tomorrow.

BUM

The guy just hit me and I was on the

ground!!!! Boom, for real.

VOICE

Hello?

BASQUIAT

(deadpan)

I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?

VOICE

Yes. My name is Chris. What's yours?

BASQUIAT

Jean Michel.

CHRIS

That's a beautiful name. French?

BASQUIAT

Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm

taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.

CHRIS

What? Wait a minute... talk to me.

BASQUIAT

(about to sob)

Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's

k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack

Marlboros!

CHRIS

What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't

permanent. Don't you believe that?

(pause)

What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?

BASQUIAT

No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.

CHRIS

You see? You have someone to live for.

BASQUIAT

No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are.

Especially here. The world's unjust. The

respect fools get. The disrespect I get.

CHRIS

What is it you want?    Respect? I have

respect for you, just    for making this call.

One philosopher said    "Sadness is a sin

against the richness    of the world." Think

about it. Feel it.

BASQUIAT

You don't even know me. I want real

respect.

CHRIS (O.S.)

(beat)

What? What do you want?

BASQUIAT

(breaking loose)

Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the

moon and the cow that jumped over it.

P.A.

One philosopher said "Give me my liquid

hijack Marlboros. Life's beautiful. You

have someone to live for. What do you want?

RKKKK! That's a beautiful name... French?

BASQUIAT

Boom, for real.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

I thought you hated this place?

GINA

I do.

(beat)

I just said that. I was never here before.

I actually like it.

BASQUIAT

Let's get out of here.

LANDLADY

Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!

LANDLADY (CONT'D)

Ohhh, Dios mio!

LANDLADY (CONT'D)

I just want the rent.

BASQUIAT

Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!

GINA

(to Jean)

What're you doing?

LANDLADY

Next Monday.

BASQUIAT

Wanna go get some breakfast?

GINA

A friend of mine offered me a job doing a

little work installing a show in a gallery.

He's an electrician. I was supposed to be

there an hour ago.

GINA (CONT'D)

Ohh, that's nice.

GREG

Jean, could you get me a Phillips

screwdriver?

BASQUIAT

A what?

GREG

A Phillips head. From the toolbox.

BASQUIAT

Yeah.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

'Phillips head,' right?

GREG

Yeah.

BASQUIAT

You don't have any!!!

GREG

That's impossible. I've got, like, five of

'em!

GREG (CONT'D)

You're holding one in your hand!!!

(beat)

You've never done this kind of work before,

have you?

(demonstrating)

See, this is a regular screwdriver, and

this is a Phillips head. The cross thing...

I'll tell you later what all the tools are

so you'll know.

RENE

I need to make a call, Mary. You don't

mind, do you?

MARY BOONE

Certainly not. You can use my line.

RENE

To Paris. Bernard Picasso -

(to Mary)

You know Bernard -

MARY BOONE

(wincing)

Be my guest.

GREG

Jean? Hold this, please.

(beat - he sees why Jean's so

distracted)

You'll get there. But it's good to have

something to fall back on. That's why I

became an electrician. It pays the rent.

Y'know, I'm an artist, too.

BASQUIAT

I didn't know.

GREG

I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find

myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're

just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And

I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition.

It gave me time to develop.

MARY BOONE

(to Milo)

I can't tell you how happy I am with this

show.

MARY BOONE (CONT'D)

(her tone impersonal)

Excuse me - you - what's your name? Would

you move those tools there and put them

somewhere else?

BASQUIAT

(to Milo)

My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you

heard of me?

ALBERT MILO

(amused)

No. Should I have?

BASQUIAT

I'm a painter, too.

ALBERT MILO

Really. Huh. Too bad.

MARY BOONE

Excuse me, would you please move those

tools?

CUT TO:

BENNY

Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette.

Concentrate.

BASQUIAT

I am... On Gina.

(beat)

Fuck - I didn't think we were actually

gonna do this.

BENNY

Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.

BENNY

You're shattering all my myths.

BASQUIAT

About what?

BENNY

Your people.

BASQUIAT

Oh - you mean black people!

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

(changing the subject)

How long do you think it takes to get

really famous?

BENNY

For a musician or a painter?

BASQUIAT

Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your

stuff all day without thinking about

anything else.

BENNY

Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.

BENNY (CONT'D)

First, you have to dress right.

BENNY (CONT'D)

Then, you have to hang out all the time -

with famous people - the right people, the

right chicks, the right parties.

BENNY (CONT'D)

And you gotta do your work all the time

when you're not doing that. The same kinda

work, the same style - over and over

again, so people recognize it and don't get

confused. Then, once you're famous, you

have to keep doing it the same way, even

after it's boring - unless you want people

to really get mad at you - which they will

anyway.

BASQUIAT

Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it.

BENNY

Famous people are usually pretty stupid.

You're too smart. You'd get bored to death.

You don't wanna be like John Henry -

fighting the machine. Just do what you do.

It's about integrity. Follow your heart.

BASQUIAT

Who's John Henry?

BENNY

Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the

railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and

laying down track. Then one day they

invented a machine to do it. And he says

"Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges

the machine to a race to lay down a mile of

track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the

whole time. They get right to the end, and

he beats it by one spike.

(pause)

Got a cigarette?

BASQUIAT

So then what?

BENNY

He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like

you do it! Your friends like you, you get

laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff

everywhere. It's good. What else do you

want?

BASQUIAT

Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros.

(indicates limo)

Check it out.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Andy Warhol. He's famous and he's not

boring.

BENNY

What're you doing? You're doing something.

BASQUIAT

He's the best painter in the world. I'm

gonna give him one of these.

BENNY

Don't give him anything, man. Your art's

worth a lot. Trade. That's what real

artists do with each other. Besides, he'll

just use you. He's famous for that.

CUT TO:

MAITRE'D

(to Jean, flustered)

Can I help you?.

MAITRE'D (CONT'D)

(to Jean)

Sir...?

BRUNO

(sympathetically)

I think it's ok.

MAITRE'D

Of course, Mr. Bischofberger.

BASQUIAT

You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.

ANDY WARHOL

Ignorant art?

BASQUIAT

Yeah... Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy

art.

ANDY WARHOL

Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.

BASQUIAT

Ten bucks apiece.

ANDY WARHOL

I can give you five. You didn't do very

much to these.

BASQUIAT

You don't even work on your stuff!

BRUNO

It doesn't matter how much you worked on

them. It matters how much you can get for

them.

BASQUIAT

I can get ten.

ANDY WARHOL

I'll take two. This one and... that one.

(to Bruno)

Can I borrow some money, Bruno?

BRUNO

Here. Do you have change?

BASQUIAT

You made a good deal. Here, you can have

these, too.

BASQUIAT

I'll be right back.

BASQUIAT

(to Benny)

Check you later, man.

BENNY

Hi Gina.

GINA

Hi.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN:

RENE (O.S.)

... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring

at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes:

How many times we counted them.

We called our bed the cloud.

And there we'd float.

The bathtub was in the kitchen

and took forever to fill up.

We'd bathe together afterwards.

Oh the countless cigarettes and

take out Chinese food...

The bed was so narrow

Three years we made it fit.

The sheets were green the

sheets were pink the sheets

white linen from the past.

Little home, farewell,

The broken windows

and the bodega on the corner.

Now from my balcony

I look out over all New York...

FADE TO BLACK

Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What

BASQUIAT

C'mon, baby, I painted them for you.

They're beautiful now.

GINA

I'm going to my parents this weekend. What

am I going to wear?

(she begins to cry)

How could you do that to me?

BASQUIAT

... I'll buy you some new ones.

GINA

You don't have any fucking money..

BASQUIAT

Do you know what he's saying?

GINA

What who's saying?

BASQUIAT

Manzanita....

(translating song)

... if one day I die, and    you read this

piece of paper, I want you    to know how much

I love you. Although I'll    never see you

again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair,

your face, your face'

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

'Even though you were never mine

And you never will be

You have a piece of my heart

You have, you have, you have...'

(he reaches down, wiping off

Gina's face)

'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your

GINA (CONT'D)

Wake up! I'm back!

GINA

Jean, what did you do to yourself?

GINA

(panicking)

Jesus Christ!

GINA

(slapping his face)

Don't do this to me.

BASQUIAT

... What's the matter?

GINA

(furious)

Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out

of me. How the fuck could you do that to

yourself?

BASQUIAT

You're back.

GINA

It's Monday morning.

BASQUIAT

It's not Sunday? I missed you. You

shouldn't leave me alone.

GINA

You're blaming me? I had to go see my

family.

BASQUIAT

I'm your family.

GINA

Basquiat, what did you take?

BASQUIAT

Nothing special - just some weed.

GINA

Basquiat, don't lie.

(holds up powder)

This is smack.

BASQUIAT

You want some?

BENNY

We got beat.

BASQUIAT

For real?

BENNY

You gonna carry that around all night?

BASQUIAT

Yeah... I'll paint on it.

ROCKETS

You did that, didn't you?

BASQUIAT

I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here

for awhile.

ROCKETS

Do one for me and it's free. How's that?

ARTIST #1

Check this out, Rene.

RENE

(singing along)

"The name of the game is survival, You

learn it in jail upon your arrival!"

ARTIST #2

Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my

apartment!

RENE

Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?

ARTIST #2

Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me

that shit!

RENE

(noticing him)

Oh my, there goes the neighborhood. Who's

house is this, anyway?

RENE (CONT'D)

(to Artist #2)

That's what I like about you straight boys.

You're so sensitive!!!

(resumes singing)

"The name of the game is survival,

Survival! Survival! only the strong

survive"

ARTIST #1

Rene! Come here, man!

RENE

I gotta go pee.

RENE (CONT'D)

(to himself)

Who did this?

(beat - louder)

Who did this?

ARTIST #2

I don't know. I told you, this isn't my

apartment.

ARTIST #3

I know who did that. That's Jean Michel's.

He's right here, man...

ARTIST #3

Fuck, man, where'd he go? Where's Jean?

RENE

(to himself)

It's fucking amazing. Motherfucker's got to

put a crown on it.

ARTIST #1

(yelling from the window)

Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's

kinda cute.

RENE

Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.

ARTIST #2

How do you know?

RENE

Just look at him.

(Rene hands the binoculars to

him)

Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots?

Honey, I don't think so.

ARTIST #3

Whoa - check it out. It's him!

RENE

MOTHAFUCKAH!

ARTIST #2

That's the same guy who did this painting.

RENE

I know that. Don't let him get away.

RENE

Hey, wait up!!!

RENE

You heard of Albert Milo. I made    that

niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't    you read

"Not About Albert Milo?" I know    who to

hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a    star.

BASQUIAT

Can you put me in the ring with him?

RENE

I can put you in the ring with him. Even

book the dates.

(beat)

But those big boys know how to fight. They

could make you look real sissy.

(they laugh)

I was looking at that painting upstairs.

It's the first time a picture made me

embarrassed to own anything.

(beat)

So what's your real name? 'Samo?'

BASQUIAT

Jean Michel Basquiat.

RENE

Sounds famous already.

RENE

Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't

anyone teach you how to mount paintings?

RENE (CONT'D)

This is a very important season in New

York. One's public appearance is absolute.

(beat - a man approaches)

Oh!!! Louise!!! I'd like you to meet Jean

Michel Basquiat -

(beat)

SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler.

HENRY

Ohh... SAMO. I've heard a lot about you. I

love your graffiti.

BASQUIAT

I was a kid then.

HENRY

(to Rene)

How much are these?

RENE

You or the museum?

HENRY

It's for me.

RENE

Five.

HENRY

I'll take it.

RENE

That's five thousand dollars.

(hissing to Jean)

He's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art so

suck my pussy, you star.

BASQUIAT

You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.

GINA

Well thanks!

RENE

This is Jean Michel, whose work I told you

about.

ANNINA NOSEI

(to Jean)

Rene hasn't stopped talking about your

paintings. Haven't I seen you in my

gallery?

BASQUIAT

No.

ANNINA NOSEI

(to Rene)

You haven't been by lately.

RENE

I didn't have the subway fare. My Medicare

ran out.

ANNINA NOSEI

(to Jean)

How do you come up with all those words you

put over everything?

BASQUIAT

I don't know.

BRUNO

You're doing well.

ANNINA NOSEI

I'd love to see some more of your work...

Where's your studio?

BASQUIAT

You name it, I paint there.

ANNINA NOSEI

Well, I don't want to get mugged on a

Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a

place for you to work. Take my card.

BASQUIAT

You want a drink?

ANNINA NOSEI

No thanks.

(to Rene)

But I'd like one of these paintings.

GINA

Who's that?

RENE

You kidding? That's Annina Nosei. Jean's

been in her gallery a thousand times.

(to Jean)

You slut. How do you know Bruno

Bischofberger?

(to Gina)

He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe.

BASQUIAT

I had lunch with him once.

BASQUIAT

Which island of Hawaii do you want our

house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?

GINA

(a little upset)

I hadn't thought about it.

BASQUIAT

(in perfect Hawaiian)

Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee -

GINA

Staten Island would be ok.

BASQUIAT

Do you wanna marry me?

GINA

Kind of a family portrait.

GINA (CONT'D)

It looks done.

BASQUIAT

Think so?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

... babies.

GINA

You mean babies with you?

BASQUIAT

What's wrong with me?

GINA

You're your own baby.

GINA

Who is it?

ANNINA NOSEI (O.S)

Annina Nosei.

GINA

Who?

GINA (CONT'D)

(through the crack)

Hello? Oh. Come in.

ANNINA NOSEI

Is Jean Michel here?

GINA

No.

ANNINA NOSEI

I'm here to see some work.

ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)

These are great.

GINA

Aren't they?

ANNINA NOSEI

How much for these five?

GINA

You should talk to him about this.

ANNINA NOSEI

(continuing to stare at the

work)

Um... Do Rene and Jean have a contract

together?

ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)

I'm interested in showing Jean's work.

GINA

I really think you should talk to him about

this.

BASQUIAT

When?

ANNINA NOSEI

How about right now?

GINA

(calling back)

Be ready in a minute!

CUT TO:

BASQUIAT

Honk the horn again, will you please?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

(annoyed)

You're late.

(to cabby)

One-fourteen Prince.

BENNY

What's the rush, John Henry?

BASQUIAT

I ain't John Henry.

BENNY

Good.

BASQUIAT

What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?

BENNY

(inhaling)

I don't really have any problems.

BASQUIAT

Good. What do you have?

BENNY

What's your fuckin' problem? You get a

girlfriend and a little attention and then

start acting all uppity with me.

BASQUIAT

(mortified)

'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'

BENNY

That's not how I meant it.

(beat)

For all you know, you might just be a flash

in the pan! You can never tell.

BASQUIAT

Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're

just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to

you!

ANNINA NOSEI

I've got to find the switch.

ANNINA NOSEI

Here it is.

RENE

3rd night I called    him 'boy'

He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well

Then don't call me    'Boss'" That

Was the end for us    and I've

Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years.

In kangaroo court I    want to be

Able to say I never kept a

Slave. But he tricked me in

To Tying him up and busting his

Face. He'll jump up at my Trial

Yelling 'He wupped me gud.'

RENE

Oh man! That's one looks famous already.

RENE (CONT'D)

You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to

write about you if you keep changing

everything?

RENE (CONT'D)

Uh huhh... Band practice?

(to Jean)

It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not

at band practice...?

BASQUIAT

(quietly)

Fuck...

(to Rene)

I forgot about that.

RENE

Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a

painter you're gonna have to break a few

hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony

Bennett..

BASQUIAT

Tony Bennett... What do you mean?

RENE

Singing on stage and painting in your spare

time.

BASQUIAT

I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.

RENE

My point exactly.

RENE (CONT'D)

So keep painting.

BASQUIAT

Yes, Boss.

(beat)

If you're so smart, why are you here with

me in this basement?

RENE

You're news. I want the scoop. I write it

down. When I speak, no one believes me. But

when I write it down, people know it's

true.

(beat)

There's never been a black painter in art

history that's been considered really

important, you know?

BASQUIAT

So what?

RENE

So shut up and keep painting..

BASQUIAT

(touched)

What time is it?

RENE

5:11.

BASQUIAT

That one's for you.

RENE

Thanks... I'll take it tonight.

BASQUIAT

I can't. After the show.

BASQUIAT

Hey - it's the big A.M..

ALBERT MILO

Rene's been telling me about your work.

ALBERT MILO (CONT'D)

Is this finished yet?

BASQUIAT

I don't know.

ALBERT MILO

When's your show?

BASQUIAT

Not sure. How was yours?

ALBERT MILO

I haven't decided yet.

(beat)

Rene, you wanna come over to the studio

tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.

RENE

How about now?

ALBERT MILO

See you at your opening. Thanks.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet

you.

ALBERT MILO (O.S.)

This is Rene Ricard.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice to have

met you.

ANNINA NOSEI (O.S)

Tom and Cynthia Kruger.

BASQUIAT (O.S)

I know.

ANNINA NOSEI

This is Jean Michel Basquiat.

(beat)

You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere.

That's his. This is the true voice of the

gutter.

CYNTHIA KRUGER

We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall

Street. And I've heard wonderful things

about the paintings. Everybody's talking

about you.

BASQUIAT

Yeah.

ANNINA NOSEI

Here's a very good example of his recent

work that's not spoken for yet.

(beat)

He's got to work in a basement. He's got so

much energy that if he worked in a place

with a window, he'd jump right through it.

Most of these are reserved already. After

this week, this work will not be available.

TOM KRUGER

(to his wife)

... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I

don't know if I could live with it. That

green is so... institutional.

KID #1

(enthusiastically)

Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling

this shit!

BASQUIAT

You like it?

KID #1

Not bad. Yeah, I do.

CYNTHIA KRUGER

I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing

out words that way.

ANNINA NOSEI

Yes, well, they are more meaningful in

their absence, no?

KID #1

(to Jean, joking)

What does it mean?

CYNTHIA KRUGER

I like this one, but that green...

BASQUIAT

Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown?

TOM KRUGER

Beg pardon?

BASQUIAT

Hi. This is Gina.

CYNTHIA KRUGER

They're something like Dubuffet's...

That... childlike quality.

CYNTHIA KRUGER (CONT'D)

(to her husband and Annina)

I can't make up my mind.

TOM KRUGER

I like this one. If it were just another

color..

BASQUIAT

Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one,

you'll have to change your whole lives -

maybe even sell your kids!

(to Annina)

These paintings aren't even done yet!!!

TOM KRUGER (O.S.)

I think we'll take the green one.

BASQUIAT

I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate

shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple

pie.

COUNTERMAN

You want three Big Macs, two chocolate

shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple

pie.

BASQUIAT

Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven

chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big

Mac, and two apple pies.

COUNTERMAN

You only want one Big Mac?

BASQUIAT

Yeah... And make it three apple pies.

BIG PINK

How can I ever thank you?

BASQUIAT

(with a smile)

I'd like to squeeze your titties.

BIG PINK

Come on.

BASQUIAT

Wanna Mac?

BIG PINK

No, I'd like the scarf.

BASQUIAT

Have a Mac.

BIG PINK

I don't eat junk food.

BASQUIAT

Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the

best restaurant in town.

(beat)

You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the

scarf, anyway. What's your name?

BIG PINK

You're a fast mover.

BASQUIAT

No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big

Pink.

GINA

Hi.

BASQUIAT

Hi.

GINA

What's that?

BASQUIAT

A present I picked up for you.

GINA

It's beautiful. Thanks.

BASQUIAT

(tenderly)

You look like an angel.

CUT TO:

VOICES IN CROWD

Jean!!! Jean Michel!!!

MAN

(wildly enthusiastic)

Jean, man!!! Let's make a record!

WOMAN

(slyly, intimately)

You finally did it.

MAN #2

(pointing to Jean, sneering)

He's so fulla shit.

MAN #3 (O.S.)

How much is he getting for these?

BASQUIAT

Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to

paint your jacket.

ANDY WARHOL

My jacket? Gee, great...

(he Polaroids Jean)

Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You

look great. You kids. You drink red wine

with fish. You can do anything! Make

paintings in the basement of your gallery?

First time I've heard of that!

ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D)

Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got

the great new gallery.

BASQUIAT

Yeah, I met her already.

MARY BOONE

(shaking Jean's hand)

You should be pleased. It's a great

show...I'm having a dinner later at Mr.

Chow's for Albert. You should come.

ANDY WARHOL

You'll like it. Everyone'll be there.

ANNINA NOSEI

Jean, your parents are here.

BASQUIAT

Hi Dad. Hi Nora.

NORA

Congratulations.

BASQUIAT

Thanks for coming.

ANNINA NOSEI

(continuing to Jean's father)

You must be very proud.

FATHER

I am!

RENE

How does it feel to have a genius in the

family?

FATHER

It feels... good!

BASQUIAT

(to Rene)

I'll be right back.

TOM KRUGER

We love our painting.

BASQUIAT

Which painting?

TOM KRUGER

The green one.

BASQUIAT

Oh yeah.

CYNTHIA KRUGER

We got a couch to match.

TOM KRUGER

She's only kidding!

BENNY

Willie Mays. A Toast.

BASQUIAT

Not now, ok?

ROCKETS

Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we

step into my office?

BASQUIAT

That's alright. I'm cool now.

ROCKETS

A gift! I was just trying to give you a

gift!

BASQUIAT

I gotta go.

RENE

(edging his way in)

This guy wants a picture.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Of the painters, please.

BASQUIAT

He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert!

Get in the picture!

ALBERT MILO

Hey, Jean, I'd like you to meet my

wife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is

Jean Michel Basquiat.

ESTHER MILO

(frowning at her son)

Don't do that.

(beat)

Hello, Jean.

JACK MILO

Hi, John... Are your parents here?

BASQUIAT

Well.

(inhaling)

My dad's here with his wife. My mom

couldn't make it.

ESTHER MILO

(waving it away)

No thanks.

BRUNO

(to Jean)

I'd like to do a show with you.

(pointing to "Rene 5:11"

painting)

I'm especially interested in that one. I'd

like to buy it for myself.

BASQUIAT

I wasn't gonna sell this one.

BRUNO

You shouldn't have put it in the show. This

is the one I absolutely have to have. I

really love it.

BASQUIAT

Sure, ok..

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Do you think I could borrow your limousine?

I'll get it back to you in an hour.

BRUNO

It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner

at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.

ANDY WARHOL

Bye, Jean.

RENE

(hissing)

You fucking little whore! You sold my

painting! I'm gonna tell you something,

brother - when you're climbing up the

ladder of success, don't kick out the

rungs! Believe that shit.

BASQUIAT

I'll make you another one.

RENE

Forget it.

BASQUIAT

Rene -

RENE

SHHHHHH. Later.

(speaking to himself)

"What is it about art, anyway......"

RENE (O.S.; CONT'D)

... that we give it so much importance?

Artists are respected by the poor because

what they do is an honest way to get out of

the slum using one's sheer self as the

medium. The money earned is proof pure and

simple of the value of that individual...

The Artist.

RENE (O.S.CONT'D)

The picture a mother's son does in jail

hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is

possible even in the most wretched. And

this is a much different idea than the

fancier notion that art is a scam and a

rip-off. But you could never explain to

someone who uses God's gift to enslave that

you have used God's gift to be free."

DRIVER

I really... admire you.

BASQUIAT

Me? Why?

DRIVER

You did it! You made it. I'm a painter,

too.

BASQUIAT

That's great.

DRIVER

Would you check out my studio some time?

BASQUIAT

Sure. I'd be glad to.

DRIVER

Here?

BASQUIAT

(calm, relieved)

What's your name, man?

DRIVER

They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.

BASQUIAT

Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?

MAITRE'D

Good evening.

ANDY WARHOL

Hi, Jean.

BRUNO

Jean, everyone loved your show.

JACK MILO

Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.

ANDY WARHOL

Saddle River's in New Jersey.

JACK MILO

Saddle River, New York!

ANDY WARHOL

It's in New Jersey.

JACK MILO

New York.

ANDY WARHOL

I think it's in New Jersey.

JACK MILO

It's in New York.

ANDY WARHOL

Oh, I didn't know that.

ALBERT MILO

(to Francesco)

You finish it.

MARY BOONE

(to Jean)

I hear your show was sold out already.

There's a very important collector who's

interested in some of your works.

BASQUIAT

Bring him over sometime. I have some other

stuff to show him.

ALBERT MILO (CONT'D)

Go on, take it..

RENE

I'd like a glass of your best champagne,

please?

(reading)

This is an enormously important season in

New York, and to make a false step could

have severe repercussions for years. We are

no longer collecting art, we're buying

individuals.

ANDY WARHOL

Oh shut up, Rene.

RENE

Everything's over your head, Andy. Even Mr.

Chow's menu.

(beat - to Jean)

Thanks for not inviting me

RENE (CONT'D)

I'm starving. You can't buy    advertising

like this. This is the most    glamorous

dinner you'll have here this    fall. How

about some of that imitation    crab?

MR. CHOW

I'm not paying for the drawing with crab.

It's a present to my friends. It's my

birthday.

RENE

Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean.

RENE (CONT'D)

He owes me one.

MR. CHOW

You're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of

here.

RENE

I haven't eaten yet!!!

RENE (CONT'D)

Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm

going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting

too long, anyway.

ANDY WARHOL

Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean.

Maybe you should do another one.

MR. CHOW

(exhausted)

Some other time.

ANNINA NOSEI

(to Jean)

It's great that people are interested, but

if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll

handle it for you. Everything goes through

the gallery, even if they come to your

studio.

BASQUIAT

Sure.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)

... had twenty-three one man shows, been in

forty three group shows from Zurich to

Tokyo..

FADE UP

INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D)

... had over fifty articles written about

you, switched galleries - how many times? -

DJ'd in the hottest clubs -

INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D)

... one of the youngest    artists ever to be

included in the Whitney    Biennial, also

produced a rap record.    It's said you're

quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna

for a couple months!!!

(takes a breath)

All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might

ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel

Basquiat to do?

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

What is it that gets you out of bed in the

morning?

(nervous laugh)

BASQUIAT

I hate this. Turn that off.

INTERVIEWER

We're running a little late.

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

(to crew)

Ready?

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

... Can you... decipher this for us?

BASQUIAT

Decipher?

INTERVIEWER

Yes. What do they... stand for?

BASQUIAT

They're just words.

INTERVIEWER

Yes, I understand - but where do you take

them from?

BASQUIAT

Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that

note from? Where do you take your words

from?

(beat)

Everywhere.

INTERVIEWER

(pointing to a detail)

What are they?

BASQUIAT

(smiling mischievously)

Leeches. A long list of leeches.

(looking at some frames

Shenge's working on)

It looks good like that.

INTERVIEWER

Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'

(beat)

You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.

BASQUIAT

You mean like an ape?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

(chewing, spilling)

A primate?

INTERVIEWER

Well, you said that.

(beat - looks at notes)

You've got a lot of references from

Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?

BASQUIAT

Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits"

painting. You like it?

INTERVIEWER

Yes, but as a black painter -

BASQUIAT

I use a lot of colors - not only black.

INTERVIEWER

What?

BASQUIAT

I'm not black.

INTERVIEWER

You're not?

BASQUIAT

Not what?

INTERVIEWER

Not black.

BASQUIAT

No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.

INTERVIEWER

Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your

roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't

he?

BASQUIAT

(growing weary)

Yup.

INTERVIEWER

Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up

were there any primitives hanging in your

home?

BASQUIAT

We don't hang them at home, y'know - just

in the streets..

INTERVIEWER

I see..

(beat)

And... How do you respond to being called -

hmmm...

(peruses some notes)

- yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."

BASQUIAT

(smiles - hurt, stunned)

Who said that?

INTERVIEWER

Why, that's from Time Magazine.

BASQUIAT

No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the

art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.

INTERVIEWER

Is it true that your mother resides in a

mental institution?

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

Let me... just... open something up here.

You come from a nice, middle class,

respectable home. Your father is an

accountant. Why did you at one time live in

a cardboard box in Tompkins Square?

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)

Or rather, do you think you're being

exploited or are you yourself exploiting

the white image of the black artist from

the ghetto?

BASQUIAT

Are those the only two possibilities?

(cramming a French Fry into

his mouth)

You wanna French fry?

INTERVIEWER

OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in

you? Any anger in your work?

BASQUIAT

Should there be?

INTERVIEWER

Tell me about it. What are you angry about?

BASQUIAT

Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember.

BASQUIAT

(to COUNTERMAN)

Can I have some caviar, please?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

I'd like to taste it, first.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Is that the best quality you have?

COUNTERMAN

Yeah, it's the best one.

BASQUIAT

I'll take the whole tin.

COUNTERMAN

It's three thousand dollars!

BASQUIAT

I'll take it.

(wipes nose with sleeve.)

Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.

(beat)

Just the caviar - I'll get the rest.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

You check everyone's bills or just mine?

CUT TO:

ANDY WARHOL

When I was little, my brother and I used to

have two ducks as pets. We called them the

Rodriguez Brothers.

BASQUIAT

I wish they'd quit writing this shit about

me.

ANDY WARHOL

That's good. At least they're interested.

BASQUIAT

Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of

paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a

SAMO tag on it.

(beat)

The other day, I just wanted a pack of

cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it

for two bucks. A week later this gallery

calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the

drawing. Should we buy it for five

thousand?"

ANDY WARHOL

Wow... Stop giving them away.

(beat)

I got an invitation to model for Comme de

Garcons... You wanna do it with me?

BASQUIAT

Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me.

ANDY WARHOL

Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You

should sign up with my modeling agent.

BASQUIAT

Cool.

ANDY WARHOL

My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea

bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea

collars. They work really well.

BASQUIAT

Let's leave this town and go someplace.

Some island.

ANDY WARHOL

Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum. They have

the world's    most famous sculptures all in

these giant    plaster replicas. It's really

great. It's    in Pittsburg.

BASQUIAT

Ouch..

ANDY WARHOL

What's wrong?

BASQUIAT

That girl looks just like my old girlfriend

Gina.

ANDY WARHOL

Do you still love her?

BASQUIAT

Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about

her.

ANDY WARHOL

Well, have you asked her to come back?

MAITRE'D

Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you

again.

BASQUIAT

Hey George, what's up?

GINA

So are you really friends with Andy? He

seems like such a weirdo.

BASQUIAT

He's not. He's out of town and he calls me

every day. What's weird about him?

GINA

Don't you think he's using you?

BASQUIAT

Why does everybody say that? He's the only

person I know who doesn't need to use me.

GEORGE

Would you like to see the wine list?

BASQUIAT

Chateau Latour '64, please.

GINA

So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next

fall. Of course, there's like, a year of

pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I'm really

excited.

(beat)

And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary.

His poems are getting published.

BASQUIAT

How is he?

GINA

Pretty much the same.

BASQUIAT

Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.

(beat)

Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to

find out how you're -

GINA

(referring to an extra loud

snicker from execs)

What's that about?

BASQUIAT

Forget it.

GINA

That is amazing. What year is it?

BASQUIAT

George?

GEORGE

I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.

BASQUIAT

See that table over there? I'd like to pay

their bill.

GEORGE

I'm sorry?

BASQUIAT

Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.

GEORGE

Really?

BASQUIAT

Yeah.

GEORGE

Very well.

BASQUIAT

(continuing)

Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really

sorry about everything. You have to believe

me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we

were -

GINA

I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking

straws.

YOUNG EXECUTIVE

Excuse me... On behalf of my friends I'd

like to apologize. We're really sorry.

BASQUIAT

I wish you niggahs could get it togeth-

ahhhhhh.

YOUNG EXECUTIVE

What's this for?

BASQUIAT

The tip.

GINA

You don't have to be sorry. There's no one

to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I

thought I was one. You made me realize I

wasn't.

BASQUIAT

What's his name?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

I have to go to the bathroom.

BASQUIAT

(re: the paintings)

What do you think?

ALBERT MILO

I like the one with the dragon's heads a

lot. But the black one's filled up with too

many heads...

(beat)

I'd take some of them out.

(beat)

I think you're painting too fast. I

wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it

breathe a bit.

BASQUIAT

It's always how you would do it. This is my

version.

ALBERT MILO

You're right. It's your version. You should

come over to the studio sometime.

BASQUIAT

Why, so you could humiliate me?

ALBERT MILO

No, I wanted to make a painting of you.

ANDY WARHOL

A little more to the right, Frank. OK...

Good. Now up... You got a little more?

BASQUIAT

What's with the wigs?

ANDY WARHOL

I'm going to send them to my friends for

Christmas presents.

BASQUIAT

You think those are good presents? Who

wants an old wig?

BASQUIAT

Piss painting?

ANDY WARHOL

I wanted to make a few more of these.

Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It

makes a good green.

BASQUIAT

How come you're not peeing on them

yourself?

ANDY WARHOL

I don't like beer.

BASQUIAT

If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just

ask. You could finger paint.

ANDY WARHOL

That was my favorite part!

BASQUIAT

We can do better. It needed more white.

ANDY WARHOL

Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so

famous.

BASQUIAT

I don't even have any friends anymore

besides you. And everyone says "Warhol?

That death-warmed over person on drugs?

He's just using you."

ANDY WARHOL

Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously,

Jean. That's why you can't stop taking

drugs. You always think people don't like

you. Everyone likes you.

BASQUIAT

People are only interested in you because

you're famous, not because they know a

fuckin' thing about your work.

ANDY    WARHOL

Bruno called. In    Europe, people are saying

you're gonna die    from drugs. They think

they can cash in    on your death.

BASQUIAT

When I was poor, everybody doubted I could

make it. When I got rich, everyone said,

`yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now

everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I

clean up, and then they say `Look. His

art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway.

I'm healthy now.

ANDY WARHOL

If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m.

You call at four in the morning. You never

show up anywhere on time - if you show up.

You're painting out everything I do!

BASQUIAT

That's better.

ANDY WARHOL

I can't even see what's good anymore.

ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D)

Yeah, I see what you mean about the white.

It's better.

BASQUIAT

After the show we should take a nice long

vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what

I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting

and start playing music again. I wanna

sing.

ANDY WARHOL

That would be a pity because you're a real

painter.

FRANK

Here's the poster for the show.

CUT TO:

BASQUIAT

Yo, Frank.

FRANK

This is really great. What a nice place.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Have you met Christine?

BASQUIAT

I don't think so.

CHRISTINE

Would you sign one of those for me?

TOXIC

YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.

RAMMELLZEE

Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't

you?

TOXIC

Uh-oh!

RAMMELLZEE

I'm here for an interrogation. You've been

called a graffiti artist and I wanna know

why. All I see are scribble scrabble

abstractions!

BASQUIAT

Boom.

RAMMELLZEE

Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters

armed? What is the prime directive of

graffiti culture? Do you know, black man?

TOXIC

(to Ram, re: Jean)

Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.

RAMMELLZEE

You're selling and ending the culture. Not

one bit of information. Only to get the

money and growl with the power, man.

TOXIC

That's ignorant.

BASQUIAT

That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid.

(beat - to Christine)

Can I get you a bowl of gumbo?

RAMMELLZEE

This interrogation is not over!

WOMAN

Albert Milo? Ugh! He's just a pressmonger.

That's all these people do.

WOMAN #2

You know, I love Jean's early work. It's

really got something. But this

collaboration with Andy - maybe they

thought it was a joke... I mean - whose

work is it? Jean's or Andy's?

RENE

His early work? He's only twenty-six!

BASQUIAT

Hey, Rene.

RENE

Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only

here on business.

RENE (CONT'D)

(loudly)

You're asking me? Nigga, please. After the

way you treated me? This is the first time

I've heard from either of you in months! I

had to crash this party! You treated me

like a suede biscuit. Rene don't play that!

I can't get him off drugs! I don't even

talk to him any more!!!

ANDY WARHOL

(to Bruno)

What's a suede biscuit?

CUT TO:

CHRISTINE

(amused)

Hey, what's this? It says right here you're

Andy's... "lapdog"...

BASQUIAT

Here... Pull over.

BASQUIAT

What's up?

KID #1

Mind your own fuckin' business.

BASQUIAT

(recognizing his work)

That's mine.

KID

That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named

SAMO did this.

KID#3

He's dead. That's what I heard.

KID #2

He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself.

That's why all those art fags in Soho are

paying more every time we bring one of

these in.

KID #1

Stupid SAMO... Hardly any of this shit

left.

KID #3

This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it

if he's almost dead.

BASQUIAT

There you go. Now it's worth more.

KID #2

What's he saying?

BASQUIAT

I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO...

KID #3

(bending close)

He says he's SAMO.

KID #1

He wish.

DISSOLVE TO:

BASQUIAT

Paint it out.

SHENGE

Out?

BASQUIAT

Yeah... Maybe just his arms.

(Shenge paints out the arms)

Put some Cerulean Blue there.

SHENGE

It's Andy again.

BASQUIAT

Still not here.

SHENGE

- In this corner?

BASQUIAT

(not looking)

Yeah..

SHENGE

You want me to put it here?

BASQUIAT

Use your fucking instinct.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Don't try to make art. Just paint like a

housepainter.

SHENGE

It's Maria Portos. What should we do?

BASQUIAT

Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I

mean Shenge.

SHENGE

Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees

me working on it!

BASQUIAT

Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for

people with money, they don't have respect

for you.

MARIA

(showing him the clogs)

These reminded me of you, the clogs. I

found them in Amsterdam.

MARIA (CONT'D)

How are you?

BASQUIAT

Fine.

MARIA

You remember Ellen?

(looking around)

What are you working on?

ELLEN

How much is something like that?

MARIA

Fifteen. Reasonable.

BASQUIAT

It's unfinished.

(to Shenge)

How 'bout some blue in the corner?

SHENGE

Blue? Where?

BASQUIAT

What's wrong with you today?

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Don't look at me like that. It hurts my

feelings.

MARIA

I love these.

ELLEN

God... I just can't even care anymore.

Compare this to a mountain or a tree.

Who're y'all trying to kid? That's what I

think. I was just in the Himalayas, and

like - OK - is this important? No. I mean,

compared to the rain forest or something?

These are just narcissistic jokes.

MARIA

(to Jean)

Who are you selling these through now?

BASQUIAT

Well, that's better.

(to Maria)

You can buy direct from me.

ELLEN

Look at these - silkscreens? What're you?

Andy Warhol Junior? It's like - not even

handmade anymore.

MARY BOONE

Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?

BASQUIAT

I need a dealer.

MARY BOONE

You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert

Milo walks in from another room.

ALBERT MILO

Hey Jean!

(to Mary)

It'll never fit.

MARY BOONE

It'll be ok.

ALBERT MILO

You better take a look. Why's your door so

small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and

your door's the size of a mouse hole!

MARY BOONE

Why are your paintings so big? Just go

home. I'll get it in.

ALBERT MILO

(to Jean)

You doing anything right now?

BASQUIAT

Naa..

ALBERT MILO

Let's get out of here.

BASQUIAT

See ya in an hour.

(to Mary)

So what do you think?

MARY BOONE

Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk

about it.

BASQUIAT

I'm here.

MARY BOONE

OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three

o'clock.

ALBERT MILO

This is painted on a backdrop from the

Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after

Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I

felt like he could've painted it, or maybe

someone else was painting it instead of me.

The Chinese calligraphers used to change

their name mid-career so they could start

over as someone else..

BASQUIAT

Do you ever get sick of it?

ALBERT MILO

Of what?

BASQUIAT

The whole thing - painting.

ALBERT MILO

No. It's one of the few times I feel good.

I used to have to go to work and cook every

day. That I got sick of.

BASQUIAT

What about the shit they write?

ALBERT MILO

You're asking me this because of the

'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person

that wrote that has the compassion of a

housefly. That's your enemy, not your

audience. Your audience hasn't even been

born yet. It's a lie that art is popular.

The only thing popular about it is that

it's written about in newspapers. I'm

surprised when anybody comes to my

openings. There're about ten people on the

planet who know anything about painting,

and Andy's one of them.

BASQUIAT

I haven't felt like talking to him since

that thing came out.

ALBERT MILO

As long as I've known Andy, he's never

asked me for anything except to speak to

you about getting off drugs. He's painted

my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows

how many places together. But he doesn't

care about me. He cares about you. You're

the only person he cares about. He's your

friend. Fuck that article. You want a

toasted bagel with cream cheese?

STELLA (O.S.)

Papa, the TV's broken... Will you fix it

please?

ALBERT MILO

Alright. I'll be right up.

STELLA

(to Jean)

Hi.

BASQUIAT

Hi.

STELLA

I've seen you before. I like your paintings

a lot. Your hair was different.

BASQUIAT

You like your dad's paintings?

STELLA

Some of them.

BASQUIAT

Stand still.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

See you later.

STELLA

Thanks

ALBERT MILO

Where's Jean?

STELLA

He just left.

BASQUIAT

B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No

snow in Switzerland this year?

BRUNO

I didn't see you.

BASQUIAT

What do you mean?

BRUNO

You haven't heard? Andy's dead.

BASQUIAT

Hello? Gina?

MALE VOICE

Who is it?

BASQUIAT

Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second.

Open the door.

BASQUIAT

Open up! Open up!

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

My mother's inside.

GUARD

Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are

over.

(beat)

Don't cause any trouble.

BASQUIAT

I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her

home.

GUARD

Don't cause any trouble.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN:

BENNY (O.S.)

Willie Mays.

FADE IN:

BASQUIAT

Willie Mays... Nice to see you.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

How's Gina? You guys getting along?

BENNY

She's good.

BASQUIAT

I guess it was a long time ago.

BENNY

Come on, let's get out of here.

BENNY

Sit down! You're gonna fall out!

BASQUIAT

Me fall? Let's get some drugs!

BENNY

Drugs??!

BASQUIAT

Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking

care of my health!

CLERK

You starting a hospital?

BASQUIAT

Just ring it up. I don't need a bag.

(to Benny)

Try this tabouli - it's great...

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

My mom told me this... Or was it a dream?

DISSOLVE TO:

BASQUIAT (O.S.)

There was this little prince with a magic

crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him,

locked him in a cell in a huge tower and

took away his voice. There was a window

made of bars. The prince would smash his

head against the bars hoping that someone

would hear the sound and find him. The

crown made the most beautiful sound that

anyone ever heard. You could hear the

ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,

that people wanted to grab the air. They

never found the prince. He never got out of

the room. But the sound he made filled

everything up with beauty.

BASQUIAT (O.S)

It's definitely time to get out of here.

BASQUIAT (CONT'D)

Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let's go to Ireland.

We'll stop in every bar and have a drink.

FADE OUT
