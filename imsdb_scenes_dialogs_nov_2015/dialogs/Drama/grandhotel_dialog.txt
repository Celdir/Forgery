MAITRE D'HOTEL

Where is that gentleman's soup?

WAITER

Where's that soup?

BOY

Quick -- come on -- come on...

CUT TO:

WAITER

(anxious voice)

Yes.

PREYSING

(grimly)

Cold.

VOICE

(near Preysing's elbow)

Mr. Preysing...

PREYSING

(in same voice)

Yes...

BELLBOY

Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --

DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:

BELLBOY

Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his

call.

GIRL

Yes, Mr. Preysing --

GIRL

(nervously)

They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...

PREYSING

(to boy)

You told me it was on -- you said

the call was through.

(he waits irritably)

SECOND GIRL

(to first)

Who's in number three?

FIRST GIRL

Senf -- the hall porter.

(Girl looks off at...)

CUT TO:

SENF

Yes, it's Senf, the head porter,

Grand Hotel... Are you at the

Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is

she in pain?,... Isn't the child

coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy

for you to talk... Get away?,... No,

I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's

like being in jail. Oh, I hope the

child comes along all right.

PREYSING

Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off

the wire... No... I was talking to

Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh...

Hello!... Is that you dear?... How

is everything at home?... What do

you hear from the factory?... No...

How are the children?... I left my

shaving set at home... Yes, is your

father there?... Hello, father?...

Our stock has gone down twenty-three

points. If our merger with the Saxonia

doesn't go through -- I don't know

what we can do... Hello, hello...

yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything

depends on Manchester... If they

refuse to come in -- well, we will

be in bad shape... no... Rely on me,

I'll make it go through -- I'll make

it go through... Waiting?... Yes,

I'm still speaking...

SUZETTE

(starting to speak)

Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that,

Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette...

Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid...

No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go

to the rehearsal... No... Madam is

in a terrible state, she didn't sleep

all night -- She's very tired... No,

I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't

want to speak in front of her... I

gave her a tablet of veronal... She's

sleeping now... You had better come

to the hotel, I'm afraid...

BARON

(speaking into

telephone)

Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron

Gaigern himself. Where are you?,...

Good... No -- first, I need money. I

need it right now. I have to make a

showing... That's my business. I

hope to do it tonight... at the

theatre or after the show... But

money -- for the hotel bill, for

tips... I don't need advice, I need

money!... Now, listen...

KRINGELEIN

Who is that, This is... Hello,

hello!... Who is that... Heinrich?

This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich.

This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can

you hear me?... I've got to speak

very quickly. Every minute costs two

marks ninety... What?... Otto

Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin,

staying at the best hotel, the Grand

Hotel... No, don't you understand? I

want to explain, but I must do so

quickly, it costs so much. Please

don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello!

Listen! You know that will I made

before my operation? I gave it to

you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy

it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin

to see a great specialist about that

old trouble of mine... It's pretty

bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I

can't live much longer.

(louder)

I haven't long to live! That's what's

the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on

the line? No, it isn't nice to be

told a thing like that. All sorts of

things run through your head. I am

going to stay here in Berlin. I am

never coming back to Fredersdorf.

Never! I want to get something out

of life, too. You plague, and bother,

and save -- and all of a sudden you

are dead. Heinrich... You don't say

anything. I am in the Grand Hotel,

do you understand, the most expensive

hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a

room here. The very best people stay

here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I

saw him -- not five minutes after I

was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell

him exactly what I think of him.

Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all

my savings; my life insurance, too;

I cashed in all my policies, the

sick benefit fund, the old age

pension, the unemployment insurance,

the burial fund and everything...

What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich.

I have to hang up now. I have to pay

three times overcharge. Just think,

Heinrich! There's music here all day

long. And in the evening, they go

around in full dress... Yes, sometimes

I have pain, but I can stand it.

Everything is frightfully expensive

here. You can imagine, the Grand

Hotel... What? Time's up...

CUT TO:

KRINGELEIN

I'm a sick man -- Heinrich -- Hello -

hello -- Operator -- every minute

two marks ninety.

BARON

Dangerous?... That's my business...

I'll do it tonight -- ...I'll do it

alone.

SUZETTE

Madam is afraid -- she will never

dance again -- there was no applause

last night --

PREYSING

Yes -- the merger -- Manchester --

it is my business as much as yours --

we've already lost eighty-five

thousand --

SENF

I'm on duty -- I can't leave the

Grand Hotel -- it's like being in

prison -- the baby --

DOCTOR

(to operator)

Any calls?

GIRL

No, Doctor.

DOCTOR

(half to himself)

Grand Hotel -- people -- coming --

going... Who cares... nothing ever

happens.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:

CUT TO:

BARON

Good little girl -- nice ones?

GIRL

Yes, Baron.

CUT TO:

SENF

(to Clerk -- as

telephone bell rings)

Is that for me?

CLERK

No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to

be brought.

(he replaces the

receiver)

SENF

(to one of the bellboys)

Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be

brought.

BELLBOY'S VOICE

Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be

brought.

SENF

Good evening, Baron.

BARON

(amiably)

Good evening. Will you send these up

to Madam Grusinskaya?

SENF

Yes, Baron.

(he hands the box of

flowers to the clerk)

Madam Grusinskaya.

CLERK

Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya.

BARON

(to Senf)

Have you my tickets for the theatre?

SENF

Oh yes, Baron --

(to Clerk)

Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam

Grusinskaya.

SENF

(to Clerk)

For me?

CLERK

(at telephone -- shakes

his head)

No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not

to be brought.

SENF

(to boy)

Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be

brought.

BARON

Charge them...

PIMENOV

(to Senf)

Good evening -- my key -- one sixty-

eight.

BARON

Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.

PIMENOV

Oh -- good evening, Baron.

BARON

How's the beautiful lady?

PIMENOV

Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the

truth, Baron -- tonight we are a

little bit nervous. Were you at the

theatre last night?

BARON

Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya

dances.

PIMENOV

Well -- last night was not so good.

BARON

I thought she was splendid!

PIMENOV

Yes -- but the audience.

CLERK

(to Japanese)

The parquot loges are behind the

parquet chairs.

JAPANESE

Then they've put me back and I want

to be up in front. How is that, chairs

in front of loges?

SENF

The train leaves at seven-thirty,

Madam. That is the only through train --

the dining car goes along.

BARON

(sarcastically)

It's always so quiet here.

PIMENOV

If you occupied the room next to

Madam Grusinskaya, you would

appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

BARON

My dear sir, I would gladly change

rooms with you.

PIMENOV

(effeminately)

No doubt you would, Baron. But do

you know, I'm quite indispensable to

her. I'm her ballet master and her

nurse. I hardly belong to myself

anymore. But, there you are, it's

Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring

her.

ZINNOWITZ

Pardon me.

(addressing Senf)

Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor

Zinnowitz.

SENF

(to bellboy)

Mr. Preysing -- from Fredersdorf --

BELLBOY

(quickly -- paging)

Mr. Preysing --

PREYSING

Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

ZINNOWITZ

Have I kept you waiting?

PREYSING

Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from

Manchester.

ZINNOWITZ

No news yet?

PREYSING

No. No word.

ZINNOWITZ

Everything depends on the Manchester

merger.

PREYSING

I know -- I know.

ZINNOWITZ

I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as

your lawyer I made it my business to

broach the matter ---

ZINNOWITZ

I'm expecting a young woman -- a

stenographer -- she will ask for Mr.

Preysing. Ask her to wait.

SENF

Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.

SENF

(to Clerk)

For me?

CLERK

No -- letters to two-eighty.

SENF

(to Clerk)

If a young woman, a stenographer, --

etc.

DOCTOR

Any letters?

SENF

No, Doctor.

DOCTOR

Telegrams?

SENF

No, Doctor.

DOCTOR

Anyone asked for me?

SENF

Nobody, Doctor.

BARON

(glancing at Doctor)

The war.

PIMENOV

(looking up from his

letter -- glances

off at the doctor)

That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You

know him?

BARON

Yes -- He always seems to be waiting

for something -- and nothing ever

comes.

PIMENOV

The war dropped him here and forgot

him.

BARON

(beams)

Yes, I was in the war.

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE

Please -- please pay some attention

to me -- I have no time.

ROHNA

(engaged with a lady

and gentleman, who

have just arrived)

If you will wait one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN

I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I

waited three days before I got a

room at all and what a room that is.

ROHNA

It's a very nice room and inexpensive,

sir.

KRINGELEIN

Did I say I wanted a cheap room to

live in -- when I came here did I

ask for a cheap room? Did I?

ROHNA

Just one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN

No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every

day is precious -- every hour --

Every minute.

KRINGELEIN

I came here because I wanted to live

here, two weeks, maybe three -- God

only knows -- I've told you I'll pay --

I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired --

I'm ill -- I can't wait.

ASSISTANT MANAGER

Has the gentleman a complaint?

ROHNA

The gentleman is dissatisfied with

room number five fifty-nine.

KRINGELEIN

I certainly have a complaint -- and

a fair one.

KRINGELEIN

(continuing)

I came here from a long distance to

stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a

room -- a big room -- like you would

give General Director Preysing --

I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can

pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you

give him a little room, way up in

the corner with the hot water pipes

going -- bang -- bang -- bang...

(he bangs at the desk

with his fist)

DOCTOR

This gentleman can have my room.

KRINGELEIN

(turning)

Oh!

DOCTOR

Send his bags up to my room.

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- but -- I --

DOCTOR

You're tired. I can see that.

KRINGELEIN

Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have

been ill...

DOCTOR

You are ill.

MANAGER

Mr. Kringelein will take room number

one-seventy-six, one of our most

expensive rooms. It is large and on

the front with bath.

KRINGELEIN

(subdued -- exhausted --)

Does that mean that the bath is my

own? --- Private?

MANAGER

Certainly, sir.

KRINGELEIN

Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks.

That's what I want -- a large room

on the front with a private bath --

Yes, that's what I want. I can pay

now if you like.

DOCTOR

That will not be necessary.

KRINGELEIN

Thank you, sir.

BARON

(amused)

Not at all, sir.

(he beams)

KRINGELEIN

(finding a friendly

face)

Permit me -- my name is Kringelein --

from Fredersdorf.

BARON

I'm Baron von Gaigern.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, a Baron!

(he is impressed)

BARON

And this is Doctor Otternschlag.

KRINGELEIN

(turning to Doctor)

Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor --

I am --

DOCTOR

I know -- I know -- when a man's

collar is an inch too big for him --

I know he is ill.

KRINGELEIN

Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --

(his finger goes

nervously to his

collar)

PIMENOV

Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.

KRINGELEIN

(to doctor)

Is this gentleman a Baron, too?

PIMENOV

(laughing)

Unfortunately no.

MANAGER

Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.

KRINGELEIN

Again?

MANAGER

Please.

CHAUFFEUR

Have you a minute now?

BARON

No -- I told you not to come in this

lobby.

CHAUFFEUR

Time's getting short.

BARON

I've told you a hundred times not to

speak to me with a cigarette in your

mouth.

CHAUFFEUR

I want to speak --

BARON

Not now.

CHAUFFEUR

Yes, sir.

FLAEMMCHEN

(we hear her ask)

Mr. Preysing.

SENF

Will you wait please.

CLERK

The stenographer is to go up -- Mr.

Preysing telephoned.

SENF

Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.

FLAEMMCHEN

Thanks --

(calling off to

elevator)

Heigh! -- Wait!

PIMENOV

(to Baron)

Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she

receive anyone. She can't -- theatre,

trains, hotels -- hotels, trains

theatre.

PIMENOV

(continuing)

I must go and dress -- she'll be

waking up and calling for me.

PREYSING'S VOICE

Come in.

CUT TO:

PREYSING

What...! --

FLAEMMCHEN

I'm the stenographer.

PREYSING

Then you will please wait outside.

FLAEMMCHEN

(lightly)

Don't hurry -- take your time.

CUT TO:

BARON

Like dancing?

FLAEMMCHEN

Not with strangers.

BARON

(turning to Flaemmchen)

Never?

FLAEMMCHEN

You're a fool!

BARON

Yes, I am rather.

BARON

He must be very nice.

FLAEMMCHEN

Who?

BARON

(gallantly)

Whoever is keeping you waiting.

FLAEMMCHEN

(indicating Preysing's

door)

Have you seen it?

BARON

Oh, my large and noisy neighbor --

really? That?

(indicating Preysing's

door)

FLAEMMCHEN

That.

BARON

(with meaning)

You?

FLAEMMCHEN

(quickly)

Oh -- work!!

BARON

(with meaning)

Oh!

FLAEMMCHEN

Dictation.

(she twittles her

fingers)

You know...

BARON

Oh... poor child. If you were free,

I'd ask you to come and have some

tea -- but --

FLAEMMCHEN

Tea would spoil my dinner.

(lightly)

One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil

it.

BARON

Reducing?

FLAEMMCHEN

(she turns invitingly)

No -- why? -- should I?

BARON

Lord no -- charming -- but why one

meal a day?

FLAEMMCHEN

(laughing in his face)

Money -- Ever heard of it?

BARON

Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are

a...

(moves fingers)

...a stenographer. Don't little

stenographers earn little pennies?

FLAEMMCHEN

Very little.

BARON

Too bad.

FLAEMMCHEN

Did you ever see a stenographer with

a decent frock on? -- One that she'd

bought herself?

BARON

Poor child --

(enthusiastically)

I wish I were free tonight -- we

could --

FLAEMMCHEN

(with invitation)

Aren't you?

BARON

(quickly)

What?

FLAEMMCHEN

Free --

BARON

(glancing up passage)

Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow

though.

FLAEMMCHEN

Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

BARON

Shall we say five o'clock --

downstairs?

FLAEMMCHEN

Where downstairs?

BARON

Yellow Room where they dance --

(business)

FLAEMMCHEN

You're very funny --

BARON

(with great meaning)

Yes? -- Tomorrow?

FLAEMMCHEN

Of course.

BARON

Really?

BARON

We'll dance.

FLAEMMCHEN

(slowly)

All right. We'll dance.

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE

Baron -- Oh, Baron!

KRINGELEIN

If I could trouble the Baron to come

and see this beautiful room. I have

ordered champagne. Perhaps the

Baroness could join us.

CUT BACK TO:

KRINGELEIN

Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!

(to Baron and

Flaemmchen)

We are having caviar -- it's expensive

but that makes no difference -- I

see the Baroness is laughing.

FLAEMMCHEN

Have caviar if you like, but it tastes

like herring to me.

SUZETTE

Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.

KRINGELEIN

Oh!

BARON

(calling back quietly

to Suzette)

Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

CUT TO:

SUZETTE'S VOICE

(quietly and reverently --

almost a whisper)

Madam has slept well.

GRUSINSKAYA

No, I have been awake -- thinking --

thinking.

SUZETTE'S VOICE

It is time for the performance.

GRUSINSKAYA

The performance?

SUZETTE

It is time.

GRUSINSKAYA

Always the performance -- every day

the performance -- time for the

performance.

(she pauses and droops

suddenly)

I think, Suzette, I have never been

so tired in my life.

(she takes the bottle

of veronal which is

nearby)

Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.

(laughs a little)

SUZETTE

(speaking into

telephone)

Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be

brought.

GRUSINSKAYA

I can't dance tonight --

SUZETTE

It will pass -- it will pass -- come.

GRUSINSKAYA

Let us cancel the engagement.

SUZETTE

But, Madam. cannot do that.

GRUSINSKAYA

Now is the time to cancel to stop

entirely. I feel it -- everything

tells me -- enough -- enough.

GRUSINSKAYA

(very quietly)

The peals are cold -- everything is

cold -- finished -- it seems so far

away -- so threadbare -- the Russians --

St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court --

the Grand Duke Sergei --

(long pause as though

she were reliving

incidents of the

past)

-- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya --

it's all gone.

SUZETTE

Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they

were to break --

GRUSINSKAYA

The pearls won't break -- they hold

together and bring me bad luck ----

I hate them!

SUZETTE

Orchids come again, Madam -- no card --

I think perhaps they are from the

same young man -- he is at the end

of the corridor -- tall -- he walks

like a soldier -- Madam must have

noticed how often he is in the

elevator with us. Last night for

instance --

GRUSINSKAYA

Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh --

quiet.

SUZETTE

Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA

Send it away -- I shan't need it.

GRUSINSKAYA

Come in.

GRUSINSKAYA

(authoritatively)

Madam Grusinskaya will not require

her car -- no -- she will not be

going to the theatre.

(she turns)

PIMENOV

It is time for the performance.

GRUSINSKAYA

(under her breath)

The performance -- the performance --

the performance.

(during this scene

the orchids fall to

the floor)

PIMENOV

(tenderly -- as he

touches her shoulder

gently)

Poor little Lisevata -- she still

has her stage frights -- it will

pass.

GRUSINSKAYA

It is not stage fright -- it's

something more --

PIMENOV

(tenderly)

What -- what is it? Last night...

GRUSINSKAYA

Last night?... There was no applause.

PIMENOV

(quickly)

There was -- there was.

GRUSINSKAYA

That theatre -- half empty -- dancing

for those few -- I was frantic -- I

finished -- the last beat and...

(she reclines her

head as the swan

finishing the dance)

...I waited -- I listened -- but the

applause didn't come -- nothing. A

man in the box -- and just the claques

behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We

are dead -- it's finished.

PIMENOV

Meierheim --

MEIERHEIM

What is this that you have cancelled

your car? Who am I that I should

wait like a fool at the door? And

here on a whim, you cancel your car.

Have you forgotten there is a

performance? Do you know the time?

Or, are we all mad? Am I your

manager?... Have we a contract? Have

we obligations? Am I blind?

(glances at his watch)

...Or is that the time?

GRUSINSKAYA

I'm cancelling the engagement.

MEIERHEIM

Oh!

MEIERHEIM

Oh! Madam is cancelling the

engagement. Madam has chosen a funny

time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha,

ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight --

there's a line in front of the theatre

since six o'clock. The house is jammed

to the roof.

GRUSINSKAYA

The house is not full -- Is it really

full?

MEIERHEIM

Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get

dressed. And what an audience -- the

French Ambassador -- American

Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville --

er -- er --

GRUSINSKAYA

(to Suzette)

Oh -- but it can't be.

SUZETTE

Oh, come, Madam -- please come.

(she holds up her

frock)

GRUSINSKAYA

(changed mood)

All right, Suzette -- quickly --

hurry.

PIMENOV

We will wait.

MEIERHEIM

You are late. Hurry.

MEIERHEIM

Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur

to bring the car.

CUT TO:

PIMENOV

How is the house?

MEIERHEIM

Terrible. After this, no more ballets

for me. Jazz --

(snaps his fingers)

Just jazz.

PIMENOV

If the house is empty again, I don't

know --

MEIERHEIM

When she gets her paint on and hears

the music -- she'll be all right. I

know these people.

KRINGELEIN

You may laugh. Caviar and champagne

may mean nothing to you, but to me --

they mean a great deal. You see, I'm

ill and all of a sudden I got a fear

of missing life. I don't want to

miss life -- do you understand?

FLAEMMCHEN

You are funny. You speak of life as

if it were a train you wanted to

catch.

KRINGELEIN

Yes -- and for me, it's going to

leave at any minute. Let's drink.

KRINGELEIN

I'm sure this beautiful room must

appeal to your taste -- distinctive,

don't you think? Velvet upholstery --

'A-number one'. I'm in the textile

trade and I know.

(he has a slight case

of hiccups from the

champagne. He touches

the drapes)

And these are real silk drapes.

FLAEMMCHEN

(amusedly)

Silk -- think of that -- silk --

they are, too.

KRINGELEIN

(who hasn't stopped

talking)

Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot

and cold running water -- You see, I

can get a bath whenever I like.

PREYSING

The stenographer!

FLAEMMCHEN

Her master's voice!

(turns to Baron)

I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, don't go.

FLAEMMCHEN

I'm engaged for the evening.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, can anyone engage you for the

evening?

FLAEMMCHEN

To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --

(to Baron)

Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five

o'clock.

(she is moving out)

BARON

What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN

(to himself)

General Director Preysing!

(possibly he turns to

Baron)

Baron, when I was sixteen years old,

I started as an office boy in that

man's factory --

BARON

Then you know him?

KRINGELEIN

Do I know him -- I know him through

and through.

BARON

I must -- I hope to see you again,

Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

You will stay, Doctor -- if you have

nothing better to do?

DOCTOR

I have nothing better to do, Mr.

Kringelein.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

BARON

Perhaps you could present me now,

Mr. Pimenov.

PIMENOV

Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not

now -- here she is.

GRUSINSKAYA

My coat.

GRUSINSKAYA

Suzette -- I told you not to bring

the pearls. I will not wear them

tonight.

MEIERHEIM

Why not?

GRUSINSKAYA

Take them back, Suzette.

MEIERHEIM

You haven't time.

GRUSINSKAYA

Hurry, Suzette.

MEIERHEIM

Such nonsense.

MEIERHEIM

(off scene)

The car for Madam Grusinskaya.

CUT BACK TO:

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "#1"

PREYSING

No news from Manchester yet -- Do

you think we ought to postpone the

conference?

ZINNOWITZ

Good heavens no. That'd create the

very worst impression. You must be

optimistic. You must convince them.

You know as well as I do that the

merger must go through.

PREYSING

Yes -- the merger must go through --

But I am used to making my deals on

a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am

an honest business man -- a good

husband and father -- I have a sense

of honor -- I have nothing to conceal.

I couldn't live happily otherwise.

ZINNOWITZ

Well, don't get excited about it. We

agreed that the merger with the

Saxonia people must go through.

PREYSING

I want to dictate my statement for

tomorrow. I can't speak without notes.

I like to have things down before me

in black and white.

ZINNOWITZ

I'll see you in the morning then, at

the conference. Everything'll be all

right, Preysing... Don't worry.

Goodnight.

PREYSING

Good night.

SEQUENCE "#2"

PREYSING'S VOICE

Both parties have fully agreed that

this merger can result only in mutual

advantages.

PREYSING

Moreover --

FLAEMMCHEN

(repeating)

Moreover --

PREYSING

(repeating)

Moreover --

(he pauses, thinking.

Picks up telephone

quickly -- into

telephone)

Is there a telegram for me yet?...

Oh -- when it does, send it up.

PREYSING

Now, where was I?

(he looks over the

sheet in her

typewriter --

accidentally his arm

touches her neck)

Oh -- sorry.

(he puts his cigar in

his mouth and walks

away. As he walks

away)

Where was I?

FLAEMMCHEN

Moreover...

PREYSING

Moreover...

PREYSING

Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz'

office?

FLAEMMCHEN

No -- only occasional jobs.

(she yawns suddenly)

PREYSING

Tired?

FLAEMMCHEN

You pay me.

PREYSING

You're a very unusual stenographer --

FLAEMMCHEN

Moreover...

PREYSING

Moreover...

(as he paces the room,

it is obvious that

he is trying to

collect his thoughts)

FLAEMMCHEN

I don't see why it's unusual for a

stenographer to be pretty -- if she

does her work well, -- seems so silly.

I don't know why they don't like

girls like me in offices. Personally,

I hate offices -- I'd much rather be

in the movies.

PREYSING

Movies?

FLAEMMCHEN

Yes, I photograph very well. Look --

PREYSING

What is this?

FLAEMMCHEN

I got ten marks for that.

PREYSING

You...

FLAEMMCHEN

(without looking up)

Me.

PREYSING

You...

FLAEMMCHEN

(reading)

Moreover...

PREYSING

(quickly)

What?

FLAEMMCHEN

(reading)

Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

PREYSING

What brown hands you have.

FLAEMMCHEN

That's from skiing.

PREYSING

Skiing?

(he holds her hands)

FLAEMMCHEN

(natural -- unabashed)

Yes... A man I know took me to

Switzerland last month...

PREYSING

A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That

must have been nice -- for him.

FLAEMMCHEN

(reading)

Only in mutual advantages --

moreover...

PREYSING

Moreover... He was a lucky man --

that man.

FLAEMMCHEN

Perhaps.

(she waits at attention)

PREYSING

Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married

man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --

FLAEMMCHEN

Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?

(she takes cigarette)

I went to Florence once, too.

PREYSING

With the same friend?

FLAEMMCHEN

(without looking at

him)

No.

PREYSING

(quickly)

Moreover, the possibility of the

successful termination of negotiations

now pending with the Manchester Cotton

Company...

FLAEMMCHEN

Not too quickly.

PREYSING

What?

FLAEMMCHEN

You're a little too fast.

PREYSING

Can't you understand me?

FLAEMMCHEN

I understand you perfectly.

PREYSING

Have you got it now?

FLAEMMCHEN

(typing)

Cotton Company --

PREYSING

Should throw a great weight into the

balance...

FLAEMMCHEN

(as he turns his back

looks at him

significantly)

...weight into the balance...

PREYSING

Come in.

BOY

Telegram for Mr. Preysing.

PREYSING

Oh -- oh.

(he throws the telegram

away from him, onto

her desk. Paces the

room.)

FLAEMMCHEN

Deal with Manchester Cotton Company

definitely off.

FLAEMMCHEN

Sorry.

FLAEMMCHEN

How nice -- your daughters?

PREYSING

My daughters -- yes, my daughters.

(he is talking more

to himself)

FLAEMMCHEN

Is that Mrs. Preysing.

PREYSING

(to himself)

Definitely off.

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?

(she is looking at

picture of Mrs.

Preysing)

PREYSING

(turns, speaks quickly --

definitely)

That'll be all -- be here tomorrow

at nine o'clock.

(he turns, goes out

onto balcony with

telegram)

CUT TO:

BARON'S VOICE

(calling)

Come in!

CHAUFFEUR

You are late -- the dancer's gone to

the theatre.

BARON

(very nonchalantly)

Well?

CHAUFFEUR

She's gone to the theatre -- don't

you know?

BARON

(very nonchalantly)

Yes.

CHAUFFEUR

(ready to explode)

And what are you going to do?

BARON

The pearls are in her room.

CHAUFFEUR

(threateningly)

Now listen to me. The others are

getting suspicious of you. I was on

the telephone to Amsterdam today,

they think you're scared.

BARON

I've been careful, I've been waiting

my chance.

CHAUFFEUR

You've been waiting your chance.

You're too much of a gentleman --

that's the trouble with you.

BARON

I told you I'll get the pearls

tonight.

CHAUFFEUR

Need any help?

BARON

No.

CHAUFFEUR

Have you got that skeleton key?

BARON

No --

CHAUFFEUR

Why?

BARON

The floor clerk is out there in the

corridor -- she sees everything ---

CHAUFFEUR

(contemptuously)

I could take care of her.

BARON

How?

CHAUFFEUR

Chloroform on a handkerchief from

behind -- while you...

BARON

No -- no -- no -- no...

CHAUFFEUR

Why?

BARON

Poor girl -- chloroform would give

her a rotten headache... I know -- I

had it in the war. Besides, she's

very pretty -- not young but --

CHAUFFEUR

You're no good for this business.

It's just a joke to you...

BARON

(swings suddenly on

him)

I don't like your tone.

CHAUFFEUR

(comes up to him --

face to face)

No --

BARON

Get out and leave it to me... be

ready to leave on the night train

for Amsterdam...

CHAUFFEUR

With the pearls?

BARON

With the pearls --

CUT TO:

LOUD SPEAKER

'You are listening to the music of

the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous

Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHAMBERMAID

No -- no -- there is no one here.

(she replaces the

receiver)

INSPECTRESS

(to Chambermaid)

You're late... What have you been

doing?

CHAMBERMAID

(grumbling)

Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come

back - come back.' They won't get

out of their rooms.

INSPECTRESS

No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here...

The Western Theater?... No...

SUZETTE'S VOICE

Have you seen Madame?

CLERK'S VOICE

(replying)

Isn't she at the theatre?

SUZETTE

Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes...

Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?...

No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at

the hotel.

MEIERHEIM

(into telephone)

Pimenov?... What's happening?... No,

I haven't found her. Is Desprez

dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all

right. Keep the show going.

(bangs down receiver)

Wait till I see her, she'll pay for

this -- this little trick is going

to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach

of contract.

SUZETTE

Madame is ill -- her nerves...

MEIERHEIM

Her nerves... What about my nerves?...

Who is she anyway? Where does she

think she is -- Russia? Those days

have passed.

SUZETTE

Madame --

MEIERHEIM

Well?

GRUSINSKAYA

I want to be alone.

MEIERHEIM

Where have you been?

SUZETTE

Should I -- Does madame wish...

GRUSINSKAYA

Suzette, please go, I want to be

alone.

MEIERHEIM

I suppose I can cancel the Vienna

engagement.

GRUSINSKAYA

I wish to be alone.

MEIERHEIM

You'll be very much alone, my dear

madame. This is the end.

(he stamps out)

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA

The end -- over -- finished --

GRUSINSKAYA

The Western Theatre --

GRUSINSKAYA

Western Theatre?

GRUSINSKAYA

The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet

master... Grusinskaya -- hurry --

hurry.

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.

GRUSINSKAYA

Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel.

I couldn't go on -- I couldn't...

No, no don't --

(long pause)

...Just alone... Good night, good

night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov,

how is it going, badly?... Uh?...

Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh --

and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see --

they didn't miss me?... They didn't

miss me.

(she lets her hand

drop with the receiver

and goes on talking

into the air)

They didn't miss me -- good night,

Pimenov...

GRUSINSKAYA

(with great humility)

Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have

finished.

(she replaces the

receiver)

BARON

Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.

BARON

Careful -- there's broken glass on

the floor.

BARON

There.

(takes a pillow from

the bed throws it

upon the floor over

the glass, steps

back)

BARON

Please do not be frightened, Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA

(after a silence)

What do you want here?

BARON

Nothing -- only to be here.

GRUSINSKAYA

Why do you hide in my room?

BARON

But surely you must know -- because

I love you.

GRUSINSKAYA

Because you love me -- you love me?

BARON

(going over to her)

Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do

you good to cry? Are you afraid?

Shall I go?

GRUSINSKAYA

I was so alone -- always alone --

and suddenly you were there and said

that.

(sitting up)

No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

BARON

Don't cry -- it tears my heart to

see you sob like that.

GRUSINSKAYA

(regaining control)

Nerves -- just nerves. You must

forgive me. I have had a bad evening.

I am very tired. Do you know what it

is to be tired -- tired of a routine

existence?

BARON

I'm afraid not -- I usually do just

what I feel like doing at the moment.

GRUSINSKAYA

So you feel like coming into a lady's

room -- and you come... What now?

BARON

(following her)

I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

GRUSINSKAYA

Certainly.

GRUSINSKAYA

Why do you look at me like that?

BARON

I did not know you were so

beautiful... and --

GRUSINSKAYA

(bitterly)

And then --?

BARON

No irony. You're so appealing -- so

soft -- so tired. I feel like taking

you in my arms and not letting

anything more happen to you -- ever.

GRUSINSKAYA

(involuntarily closing

her eyes)

And -- and --

BARON

How tired you are!

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes -- tired...

BARON

So alone.

GRUSINSKAYA

Alone. All alone.

(whispers in Russian)

Oh, you strange -- strange creature.

BARON

You mustn't talk Russian to me.

GRUSINSKAYA

Strange man...

BARON

Am I quite strange to you?

GRUSINSKAYA

Not quite strange now. It is as if I

had been expecting you. You know,

once when the Grand Duke was alive,

I found a man hiding in my room -- a

young officer --

BARON

And...?

GRUSINSKAYA

He disappeared. Later he was found

dead.

BARON

I never knew it was so dangerous to

hide in a woman's room when she's

alone.

(he embraces her)

GRUSINSKAYA

Go away. Who are you --?

BARON

A man who could love -- that is all,

who has forgotten everything else

for you.

GRUSINSKAYA

You could love me. It is so long

since I have heard that word. Nobody

has loved me for a long time. It is

so icy-cold to be famous. One is so

cruelly alone. How is it that you --

Let me look at you. Your hands. Your

eyes. Why could you love me?

BARON

I saw you just now -- then I saw you

cry -- and now I see you in the mirror --

Grusinskaya...

GRUSINSKAYA

Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew

how I slaved and slaved for

Grusinskaya -- for the success of

Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of

Grusinskaya... and what is she now?

Just someone who has found that on

the day success ceases life ceases --

Are you listening to me -- Do you

understand? -- I want you to

understand.

BARON

Yes -- I do understand.

GRUSINSKAYA

I think you must go now -- the key

is on the floor.

BARON

I'm not going -- You know I'm not

going -- Let me stay here?

GRUSINSKAYA

I want to be alone.

BARON

That is not so -- you don't want to

be alone.

(he looks back at the

bed as if remembering

the suicide.)

GRUSINSKAYA

I want to be alone --

BARON

No -- You don't want to be alone at

all -- You were in despair before --

If I left you, you'd feel worse than

you did before, You must not be alone --

You mustn't cry -- you must forget...

Tell me that I can stay with you --

tell me.

GRUSINSKAYA

(whispering)

Just for a minute then.

BARON

What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.

GRUSINSKAYA

You -- man...

GRUSINSKAYA

Thank you -- you are gallant.

(she turns, her mood

has changed)

What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya

weeping is a sight worth seeing. It

is many years since she did such a

thing... You frightened me -- badly.

You're responsible for this -- painful

scene.

GRUSINSKAYA

The stage frays one's nerves... the

discipline -- it's so exacting.

Discipline means doing what you don't

want to do and take no pleasure in

doing. Do you know what I mean? Have

you ever experienced the weariness

that comes from discipline?

BARON

I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take

pleasure in doing.

GRUSINSKAYA

I see -- you do only what you take

pleasure in doing. You take pleasure

in coming into a woman's bedroom and

you come. You take pleasure in a

dangerous climb onto a balcony, so

you do it... And what is your pleasure

now?

BARON

(naive as he says

frankly)

I should like to smoke.

GRUSINSKAYA

Why do you smile?

BARON

Because I can see something in the

mirror that you cannot. My dear --

(he pauses suddenly)

GRUSINSKAYA

What can you see?

BARON

You are beautiful!

GRUSINSKAYA

No.

BARON

Beautiful but so sad. I did not know

it was so dangerous to look into a

woman's bedroom.

GRUSINSKAYA

I think you had better go now. The

key is on the floor.

BARON

I'm not going... You know that I'm

not going... Do you think I could

leave you alone here? After that --?

GRUSINSKAYA

What?

BARON

The veronal -- you. I'm going to

stay here with you.

GRUSINSKAYA

I want to be alone.

BARON

That is not the truth.

(he catches her wrists)

You do not want to be alone -- you're

afraid of being alone -- I know you're

afraid. I know you. You were

desperate, just now, if I go away

you'll be more desperate than ever.

Say I am to stay with you... say it.

(he almost shakes her)

GRUSINSKAYA

(whispers)

For just a minute then.

(she pulls away,

crosses the room,

quickly to the door,

with almost a cry.

She looks around for

the key to the door)

No -- oh, no!

BARON

Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --

KRINGELEIN

Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful.

To live -- to live -- in the Grand

Hotel.

DOCTOR

(with a deprecating

gesture)

The Grand Hotel.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the

champagne -- girls when they dance --

all the shining ice in those big

silver things -- That's life --

DOCTOR

Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are

drunk -- good night.

(he leaves)

KRINGELEIN

(to doctor)

But Doctor --

KRINGELEIN

Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk --

good night.

GIRL ONE

Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no,

Baron von Gaigern's room does not

answer... Yes,... all right... Baron

von Gaigern's chauffeur calling.

GIRL THREE

Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor

Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no

messages... No, Doctor.

GIRL FIVE

Grand Hotel -- good morning... who

is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh,

Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is

not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir...

yes, sir --

VOICE

Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty

two for today.

GIRL EIGHT

-- good morning... Mr. Preysing --

(she plugs through)

CUT TO:

GERSTENKORN

(glances at watch)

Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us

waiting.

SCHWEIMANN

(who has returned)

He likes to play the great man.

WAITZ

(glancing at market

report from table)

The Preysing stock is holding its

own today on the market.

SCHWEIMANN

Ask Preysing what it's costing him

to keep it up.

GERSTENKORN

And ask me what it's costing us to

hammer it down.

WAITZ

Exactly.

GERSTENKORN

If the Preysing people get the

Manchester contract, we shall

certainly merge with the Preysing

company -- but if they haven't they're

ruined -- Preysing will have to

declare himself.

WAITZ

Shhh -- here he is now.

FLAEMMCHEN

(beams)

Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr.

Preysing will be here in a minute.

PREYSING

(enters)

Good morning, gentlemen.

MEN

Good morning.

PREYSING

Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting

for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal

advisor.

WAITZ

Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against

us? -- The whole thing seems to me

to be very simple.

GERSTENKORN

Very simple -- I've always liked the

way you dressed, Preysing -- English,

isn't it?

PREYSING

(disturbed)

What?

GERSTENKORN

(quickly)

They turn out marvelous material in

Manchester.

PREYSING

Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they

do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we

begin at the beginning? -- Have we

cigars -- water and everything?

SCHWEIMANN

(with a wink to

Gerstenkorn)

Manchester is a very interesting

city, don't you think so, Preysing?

PREYSING

(stalling)

Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in

the textile industry naturally has

to know Manchester.

GERSTENKORN

There's a lot of business to be done

with the Manchester Cotton Company.

They've the whole English market

right in their hands. Have you any

connections with -- Manchester?

PREYSING

(quickly)

We have a good many connections in

England, naturally.

GERSTENKORN

I mean with the Manchester people?

PREYSING

(looking at Gerstenkorn

impudently)

We are here to discuss our merger.

Naturally I can make no statement at

this time. We must begin at the

beginning.

GERSTENKORN

(winking at Schweimann)

All right.

PREYSING

(far-away commencing

to read his report)

Since, on the eleventh of June, this

year -- when the first negotiations

for a merger between our respective

firms was entered into -- both parties

have fully agreed that this merger

can result only in mutual advantages.

GERSTENKORN

Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!

PREYSING

I'm laying before you the last general

statement of our concern. Active

capital, plant and machinery, raw

material and finished product -- for

instance -- mop rags --

GERSTENKORN

Mop rags --!

GERSTENKORN

What we want to know about is

Manchester.

WAITZ

Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we

want to know.

PREYSING

I'd like to wait for Justice

Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.

GERSTENKORN

Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --

PREYSING

No water -- What a place!

GERSTENKORN

All you have to do is phone for it.

FLAEMMCHEN

Water -- seltzer, three or four

bottles and cigars -- good ones.

WAITZ

I can see this session is going to

be exhaustive.

PREYSING

Now to proceed with the projected

merger, the advantages for the Saxonia

are so obvious...

GERSTENKORN

Oh -- now let's talk like adults.

You want to tell us now a along story

of what your factory can do. We know

all that you could tell us and if

you tell the truth it wouldn't sound

so good. When you first approached

us...

PREYSING

We did not approach you.

WAITZ

(quickly looking

through the papers)

Letter on file September fourteenth

would show that you approached...

PREYSING

(snatching the document

from his hand --

losing his temper)

It isn't so -- this was a response

to a tentative feeler of your own.

GERSTENKORN

(snatching the document

violently away)

Tentative my foot -- a month before

this your old father-in-law came

very privately and scratched at my

door.

PREYSING

Scratched --

(he nearly chokes)

We did not take the initiative.

GERSTENKORN

Of course you took the initiative.

ZINNOWITZ

Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the

conference is already underway.

PREYSING

Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz --

I'm at cross-purposes with these

gentlemen -- will you clear up the

situation?

ZINNOWITZ

But the situation is perfectly clear,

If you will allow me --

(he clears his throat)

GERSTENKORN

How clear is Manchester?

ZINNOWITZ

Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always,

I'm told.

(to Preysing)

Have you said anything about

Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING

I can make no statement about

Manchester at this time.

ZINNOWITZ

Well -- gentlemen.

ZINNOWITZ

Since, on the eleventh of June of

this year -- when the first

negotiations for a merger...

GERSTENKORN

(over Zinnowitz's

voice -- with a sigh --

sits back)

Thank God we're beginning at the

beginning.

ZINNOWITZ

(stops suddenly --

takes glasses from

his nose -- he is

speaking, not reading)

As you remember it -- when you

approached us...

GERSTENKORN

(bangs the paper down)

We did not approach you.

PREYSING

I know you did -- I said you did --

GERSTENKORN

And I said we didn't.

WAITZ

And I know we didn't.

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA

Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition

was in my blood -- no rest, no

stopping. We were drilled like little

soldiers -- We danced in the school

of the Imperial Ballet, in St.

Petersburg. I was little and slim

but hard as diamond -- a duty machine --

No rest, no stopping. And then -- I

became famous and whoever is famous

is alone... But why should I be

telling you this? Last night I did

not know you at all -- who are you,

really? -- I do not even know your

name.

BARON

I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My

mother called me Flix.

GRUSINSKAYA

Flix. -- And how do you live? What

kind of a person are you?

BARON

I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep

of a white flock -- I shall die on

the gallows.

GRUSINSKAYA

Really?

BARON

Really, I haven't a bit of character.

None at all.

GRUSINSKAYA

No?

BARON

When I was a little boy I was taught

to ride and be a gentleman -- at

school, it was a monastery, I learned

to pray and lie -- and ---

GRUSINSKAYA

And?

BARON

And then, in the war, to kill and

hide. That's all.

GRUSINSKAYA

And what do you do -- now?

BARON

I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large

like a happy pig, devouring anything

of life that pleases me, I really

belong in jail

GRUSINSKAYA

Oh! What a picture -- and what else?

BARON

(seriously)

I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.

(he turns away)

GRUSINSKAYA

That's a silly joke.

BARON

(turns -- takes both

her hands)

Please look at me. You must believe

me -- you must believe that I love

you -- that I have never known what

love is -- until last night.

(he releases her hands

and turns away again.)

GRUSINSKAYA

What is the matter?

GRUSINSKAYA

Flix!

BARON

There.

GRUSINSKAYA

(with a little cry of

pain)

Oh --

(in the silence

Grusinskaya puts her

head in her hands

and thinks)

GRUSINSKAYA

(softly)

Did you come here just -- just for

that? Oh -- it's horrible.

GRUSINSKAYA

You may keep the pearls -- I don't

want them any more -- I'll make you

a present of them.

BARON

(passionately)

I don't want them now.

GRUSINSKAYA

(broken)

I'll not denounce you.

BARON

I know.

GRUSINSKAYA

So --

BARON

Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

GRUSINSKAYA

But now, you must go... I give you

the pearls. But now you must go ---

BARON

I wanted money desperately -- Can

you understand? -- That's why I wanted

the pearls. I was threatened -- I

was desperately in need of a certain

big sum of money. I've been following

you -- I've admired you. But I have

forced myself not to think about you --

Last night, at last, I managed to

came into your room and -- and now.

GRUSINSKAYA

(softly)

And now?

BARON

I couldn't go through with it.

(his head goes down

into her lap -- he

sighs:)

Remarkable.

BARON

Do you understand?

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes -- yes -- yes.

GRUSINSKAYA

Quickly -- here.

GRUSINSKAYA

Good morning, Suzette.

SUZETTE

(delighted to see her

in a good mood)

Good morning, Madam.

SUZETTE

Madam has slept well?

GRUSINSKAYA

(enthusiastically)

Oh, yes, Suzette.

SUZETTE

Madam will dress now, it is late.

GRUSINSKAYA

Five minutes, Suzette, come back in

five minutes. I'll ring.

SUZETTE

Yes, madam Suzette knows all about

it.

SUZETTE

Madam is beautiful this morning.

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes, Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA

You must go now.

GRUSINSKAYA

There -- it begins.

GRUSINSKAYA

Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...

GRUSINSKAYA

(to Baron)

No --

GRUSINSKAYA

What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you

mad? We always have great success in

Vienna... Certainly not. Come here

and see me... yes... good-bye.

GRUSINSKAYA

(quickly)

There -- the day begins... I must go

to rehearsal.

BARON

Grusinskaya --

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes.

BARON

You do believe that I really love

you?

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd

die after last night.

BARON

I want to be good to you -- madly

good.

GRUSINSKAYA

Suzette will be back here in a minute.

BARON

I'll go -- good-bye.

GRUSINSKAYA

Shall I see you again?

BARON

I --

GRUSINSKAYA

Suzette will be back here any minute.

BARON

When are you leaving Berlin?

GRUSINSKAYA

Very early in the morning.

BARON

For Vienna?

GRUSINSKAYA

Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you

come too -- I think it would be better --

for us -- for us both.

BARON

Oh -- yes but -- later.

GRUSINSKAYA

Why later?

BARON

I have no money now -- I must get

some first -- I must get some.

GRUSINSKAYA

I'll give you what you need -- I

have money.

BARON

Oh no -- that would spoil everything.

I'll -- I will manage somehow --

I'll manage myself. I will go with

you. When does the train leave?

GRUSINSKAYA

Six twenty-seven in the morning...

But the money?

BARON

Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a

whole day. I'll be on that train.

GRUSINSKAYA

I shall dance and you'll be with me

and then -- listen -- After that you

will come with me to Lake Como, I

have a villa there. The sun will be

shining. I will take a vacation --

six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be

happy and lazy. And then you will go

with me to South America -- oh!

GRUSINSKAYA

You must go now. Be careful on your

way to your room.

BARON

I'll go. -- I love you.

(he kisses her)

I'll be on that train. I'll get the

money.

GRUSINSKAYA

Don't do anything foolish -- I'm

alarmed about you.

BARON

Don't worry. I'll be on the train.

(he kisses her)

He leaves.

GRUSINSKAYA

(speaking into

telephone)

Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are

you, in your room? Come, I will see

you now... hurry.

GRUSINSKAYA

Not that dark dress -- something

light -- bright -- it's a sunny

morning, Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA

Come in.

(sings)

GRUSINSKAYA

Good morning, Pimenov.

PIMENOV

(a little puzzled at

change in her)

Good morning, Gru -- your --

GRUSINSKAYA

Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new

ballet -- it must have mad music --

I'll explain it to you later. But

now, hurry to the theatre -- I want

full rehearsal -- properties -- full

ballet and some musicians. Hurry --

Quickly. I will be there --

PIMENOV

Gru -- you are positively radiant.

GRUSINSKAYA

Yes, Pimenov.

(quickly to Suzette)

One minute, Suzette, I will call

you.

GRUSINSKAYA

(very very softly -

her voice is like

music to operator)

Hello -- will you -- will you get me

Baron von Gaigern, please... yes...

Baron von Gaigern -- yes...

GRUSINSKAYA

(again into telephone)

Will you get me Baron von Gaigern,

please...

(she speaks quietly)

Cherie... yes... it is you...

nothing... good morning, good morning,

cherie... nothing... no... just to

tell you I'm happy.

FADE OUT SLOWLY:

END OF SEQUENCE "#3"

SEQUENCE "#4"

DISSOLVE TO:

SENF

Step back please.

SENF

I've told you three times -- Baron

von Gaigern is out.

CHAUFFEUR

Did he leave any message for me?

SENF

No, he did not -- there is no message.

DOCTOR

(to Senf)

Any letters?

SENF

No, doctor.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a

day!

BARON

(to Senf)

Madam Grusinskaya.

SENF

(taking the flowers

and handing them to

clerk)

For Madam Grusinskaya.

CLERK

(to page boy)

Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

SENF

(to Baron)

Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

BARON

(Quickly -- shortly)

All right.

(he glances around

apprehensively)

KRINGELEIN

Baron, we must have gone a hundred

miles an hour, at least...

BARON

Yes, quite.

KRINGELEIN

(to doctor)

We've been together all day... and

in an aeroplane.

DOCTOR

Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best

shops, the very best. Look, Doctor,

silk -- feels so nice on the skin...

a London hat, see -- made in England,

that's silk, too -- fifty marks...

Look, the price is on it. That was

half my salary before. The Baron is

a very fine gentleman -- no one in

my life has been so nice to me as

the Baron.

BARON

I'm going to change and we'll meet

for a drink in the Yellow Room.

KRINGELEIN

In the Yellow Room, where the music's

playing and the ladies are?

BARON

(amused)

Where the music's playing and the

ladies are...

DOCTOR

No pain, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN

Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I

had pain I'd be too happy to notice

it...

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

CUT TO:

ZINNOWITZ

...and let me say again for the tenth

time...

(he is hoarse and

tired)

...you people were quite ready for

the merger. You declared yourselves...

fully agreed on all the terms -- Why

should the signing of these articles

be suddenly held up?

GERSTENKORN

I've admitted that at one time we

had reason for desiring ther merger --

What reason have we now? The Preysing

Company has fallon upon evil days,

very evil days.

PREYSING

Evil days -- I've shown you here --

(he bangs the paper)

-- my company exports to the Balkans

alone, sixty-five thousand marks

worth of mop rags a year.

GERSTENKORN

Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're

interested in something quite

different!

PREYSING

What?

SCHWEIMANN

(to Gerstenkorn --

with a sigh)

Shall I tell them again?

GERSTENKORN

(glancing at his watch)

Why waste time -- it's getting late.

SCHWEIMANN

You see -- what we are interested in --

GERSTENKORN

(interrupting)

Ah, come on -- we're going home.

ZINNOWITZ

(rising)

Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a

regard for certainties...

GERSTENKORN

You've talked enough today, you're

hoarse now.

GERSTENKORN

Sorry, Preysing.

(he gets his hat)

PREYSING

(nervously)

You've decided against the merger?

GERSTENKORN

Yes --

PREYSING

Then, it's all over?

GERSTENKORN

Yes --

WAITZ

(to Zinnowitz)

Well -- well -- You could call my

office.

GERSTENKORN

Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull

through. This is a very bad time to

be in such a crisis. We've...

PREYSING

(interrupting)

Why talk -- it's over -- it's over --

it's finished. You've broken off

negotiations. You did it. You're

calling them off. You had nothing on

your mind all day, but Manchester, --

Manchester -- Manchester.

(he develops almost a

passion)

You don't suppose for one moment

that I'm such a fool as not to have

something that I could say definitely

about Manchester.

(he is generating

almost a passion)

GERSTENKORN

What?

PREYSING

Oh no -- no -- the session is over.

Let's go, it's off. Thank you,

gentlemen.

(he starts packing up

his papers.)

GERSTENKORN

If you actually have news from

Manchester then...

PREYSING

Gentlemen, I am now free to

announce...

(he is perspiring,

his hands are

trembling)

...that the deal between my firm and

the Manchester Cotton Company has

been successfully negotiated.

GERSTENKORN

Preysing, you're joking with us.

SCHWEIMANN

You're a deep one.

GERSTENKORN

In that case give us the articles.

We'll sign at once. We know all the

details...

PREYSING

(smiling, slowly folds

up the telegram and

puts it back in his

pocket)

I thought we'd suspended negotiations,

gentlemen.

GERSTENKORN

Under these circumstances it's quite

a different matter.

PREYSING

Under these circumstances we might

refuse to sign.

GERSTENKORN

Come on -- business is business --

Come on --

GERSTENKORN

Here's my signature -- here Preysing,

sign here.

ZINNOWITZ

What a session this has been.

SCHWEIMANN

It's twenty-five to six.

WAITZ

We should celebrate this with a bottle

of wine.

GERSTENKORN

(with his hat and

coat)

See you soon, Preysing. Next week

we'll meet and discuss further

details.

PREYSING

Next week.

PREYSING

(to himself)

Next week.

ZINNOWITZ

You let me talk till I'm hoarse and

you had Manchester sewed-up all the

time. Why?

ZINNOWITZ

Well -- the deal has been put through.

PREYSING

Yes, it has been put through -- it

has been put through.

ZINNOWITZ

(to Preysing)

What's the matter with you?

PREYSING

(hysterically)

Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

ZINNOWITZ

What's bluff?

PREYSING

(throwing the telegram

on the table)

That.

ZINNOWITZ

(reading at out loud)

'Deal with Manchester definitely

off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have

thought it of you.

PREYSING

No one would have thought it of me.

I've been getting rusty in

Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what

the world wants I guess I can put up

as big a bluff as anyone. From now

on...

(he turns away)

ZINNOWITZ

You must go to Manchester at once

yourself and really see it through.

PREYSING

Yes -- I must go to England -- I was

desperate -- Now I don't care --

This sort of thing goes to a man's

head.

ZINNOWITZ

What you need is some relaxation.

PREYSING

Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd

like to tear loose -- I'd like a

drink. I'd like to go down to that

dancing place. I'd like to start

something.

ZINNOWITZ

I can understand that -- after your --

uh --

PREYSING

Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's

the first time in thirty years that

I've ever... Where's that

stenographer? Miss Flaemm...

ZINNOWITZ

What do you want with her?

PREYSING

I want to see her, I want to do some

dictating -- report of the conference

for my father-in-law.

ZINNOWITZ

She had an engagement in the Yellow

Room at five o'clock -- she was in a

hurry.

PREYSING

Zinnowitz, would you say she was

pretty?

ZINNOWITZ

Pretty as a picture.

PREYSING

Let's go down and find her -- I need

a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.

(he is picking up

papers)

I don't know anything about women --

been married for twenty-six years.

ZINNOWITZ

Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does

it. Goodnight.

PREYSING

Aeh!

PREYSING

(into telephone)

Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that

you?... The agreement is signed -- I

did it... yes, father-in-law... but

now I must go to Manchester.

DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:

DISSOLVE OUT:

DOCTOR

(to barman)

Barman -- whiskey --

(to Kringelein)

For you, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN

For me? -- Oh, please, something

sweet and cold.

BARMAN

A Louisiana flip, sir?

KRINGELEIN

A Louisiana flip, that sounds very

nice -- sweet, eh? --

DOCTOR

What do you do in the Grand Hotel?

Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do

business -- flirt a little -- dance

a little. A hundred doors to one

hall and nobody knows anything about

the person next to him. When you

leave another takes your room and

lies in your bed -- the end.

FLAEMMCHEN

Good evening, Mr. Kringelein --

Where's the Baron?

KRINGELEIN

I'm waiting for him here. The Baron

and I have been together all day. A

hundred miles an hour -- in a motor

car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was

marvelous --

FLAEMMCHEN

Mr. Kringelein -- How you have

changed, you look so nice.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh,

please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me,

Miss Flaemm, won't you have something

sweet -- a Louisiana flip.

(to barman)

A Louisiana flip.

FLAEMMCHEN

(to barman)

No - absinthe.

KRINGELEIN

(amazed)

Yes -- that --

FLAEMMCHEN

You like music?

KRINGELEIN

Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man

might --

FLAEMMCHEN

(mischievously)

A man might what?

KRINGELEIN

I don't know -- I'd like to do

anything --

FLAEMMCHEN

(very quietly)

Oh -- you would!

BARON

(to Flaemmchen)

Hello -- sorry I'm late.

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink --

A Louisiana flip?

BARON

Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you

feel now?

KRINGELEIN

A little strange, Baron.

FLAEMMCHEN

I'd given you up.

BARON

(to Flaemmchen)

Sorry.

KRINGELEIN

A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

BARON

No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

FLAEMMCHEN

Dance then?

(they exit)

KRINGELEIN

(to Doctor)

She's beautiful -- isn't she?

DOCTOR

(to Kringelein)

Oh -- there are plenty of women.

FLAEMMCHEN

What have you been doing all day?

BARON

Chasing around.

FLAEMMCHEN

Chasing what?

BARON

Money.

FLAEMMCHEN

You were very different yesterday.

BARON

Yesterday -- yes -- that was

yesterday.

CUT BACK TO:

DOCTOR

Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting

what you're looking for?

KRINGELEIN

What, Doctor?

DOCTOR

A masculine paradise -- drink, the

ladies, dancing...

KRINGELEIN

I had a very good opportunity, a

young lady asked me to dance -- I

ought to be able to dance, it seems

to be very important.

DOCTOR

You must learn as quickly as your

time allows -- Believe me Mr.

Kringelein, a man who isn't with a

woman is a dead man.

KRINGELEIN

Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you

anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you

all alone in the world.

DOCTOR

(quietly)

I'm always alone -- I have been

everything.

KRINGELEIN

Everything?

DOCTOR

I was sent as a military surgeon to

South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken

prisoner. Home on parole not to fight.

I was a surgeon in the Great War

till the end. Grenade in the face.

Carried diphtheria bacilli in the

wound until 1920. Isolated two years.

(pause)

I've been everything.

CUT TO:

FLAEMMCHEN

That was lovely.

BARON

Will you do me a big favor?

FLAEMMCHEN

I'll do anything for you.

BARON

Would you like to make a man happy?

FLAEMMCHEN

(quietly)

Yes -- I'd love to.

BARON

Then dance the next number with

Kringelein.

FLAEMMCHEN

Why?

BARON

I feel sorry for him.

FLAEMMCHEN

You're not a bit like you were

yesterday.

BARON

I fell in love last night -- the

real thing.

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh -- there's no real thing -- it

doesn't exist.

BARON

I thought that, too -- but I found

that it does. Come along, dance with

Kringelein.

FLAEMMCHEN

Anything for you.

PREYSING

Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN

Hello!

PREYSING

I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN

(with the Baron)

Presently, Mr. Preysing.

PREYSING

It's urgent.

BARON

Pardon me, the lady has urgent

business here with me.

PREYSING

(to himself)

Insolent -- Berlin manners.

KRINGELEIN

I wish you a very good evening, Mr.

Preysing. You are staying here, too,

Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING

I don't know you.

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein

at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper,

building C, room twenty-three --

third floor.

FLAEMMCHEN

(quickly)

Come and dance with me, Mr.

Kringelein.

PREYSING

I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm --

business.

FLAEMMCHEN

(lightly)

Tomorrow morning.

PREYSING

No -- now.

FLAEMMCHEN

Do you gentlemen know each other,

Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing --

Baron von Gaigern.

PREYSING

Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend

and not accept your invitation to

dance.

KRINGELEIN

I could not think of not accepting.

PREYSING

You say that you are employed by us

in Fredersdorf, and here you are in

Berlin, indulging in diversions which

ill befit your position and which

are very much beyond your means --

Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein,

I think we will look into your books.

FLAEMMCHEN

Now, children, no fighting -- save

that for the office. Let's have our

dance.

(her arms go around

Kringelein. They

dance off)

PREYSING

I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.

BARON

Oh, let the poor devil alone.

PREYSING

I did not ask your advice.

BARON

I think it would be much better if

you went away.

PREYSING

We shall see who remains here the

longer.

BARON

(shrugging his

shoulders)

As you will.

CUT TO:

FLAEMMCHEN

You must look at my face and not at

the floor.

KRINGELEIN

Yes.

FLAEMMCHEN

You're trembling.

KRINGELEIN

I never danced before -- in public.

FLAEMMCHEN

You dance splendidly.

KRINGELEIN

I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN

Really?

KRINGELEIN

For the first time in my life, I'm

happy.

FLAEMMCHEN

Let's stop -- I'm tired.

KRINGELEIN

Thank you, Miss Flaemm.

PREYSING

Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.

KRINGELEIN

Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?

PREYSING

You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

Does the world belong to you, Mr.

Preysing?

PREYSING

What is this insolence?

KRINGELEIN

Do you think you have free license

to be insulting? Believe me you have

not. You think you're superior, but

you're quite an ordinary man.

PREYSING

Go away -- go away.

FLAEMMCHEN

Please -- please!

KRINGELEIN

You don't like to see me enjoying

myself.

PREYSING

Who are you? -- An embezzler most

likely.

KRINGELEIN

An embezzler -- you're going to take

that back, right here in the presence

of this young lady -- who do you

think you're talking to? You think

I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot

dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate

Preysing.

PREYSING

You're discharged.

KRINGELEIN

Me?

PREYSING

Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get

out -- you're discharged.

KRINGELEIN

You can't discharge me -- I'm my own

master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm

going to die -- do you understand?

I'm going to die very soon. Nothing

can happen to me now. Nobody can do

anything any more to me. By the time

you can have discharged me I shall

have been dead already.

(his laugh becomes a

convulsive sob)

DOCTOR

Come, Mr. Kringelein.

(he pulls him out of

the scene towards

the bar)

PREYSING

(his fists clenched,

between his teeth)

The man's insane -- he acts as if he

is glad he is going to die...

(hesitates -- to

Flaemmchen)

I shall see you in the lobby in half

an hour.

END SEQUENCE "#4"

SEQUENCE "#5"

HOUSE DETECTIVE

Better let him stay -- I've sent for

the Baron... How's your wife coming

along?

SENF

I was at the hospital all night

walking up and down the corridor.

They wouldn't let me in to see her.

She has the pains, but the child

doesn't come and I have to stay here

chained to this desk.

HOUSE DETECTIVE

It will be all right.

SENF

I hope so.

PREYSING

Did you send that page?

SENF

The young lady's there, sir.

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING

Sit here.

(calls to a boy)

Cognac -- for you?

FLAEMMCHEN

Nothing.

PREYSING

I'm going to keep an eye on that

Kringelein fellow. I'll find out

where he gets the money to hang around

the Grand Hotel.

FLAEMMCHEN

Well -- you want me?

PREYSING

(looks straight at

her)

Yes.

FLAEMMCHEN

Well?

PREYSING

I must go to England -- at once.

FLAEMMCHEN

Well?

PREYSING

You see, I'd like to take a secretary

with me for my correspondence and --

humm -- humm -- for company on the

trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody --

I don't know if you quite understand

me. You said you have travelled with

gentlemen -- and I mean --

FLAEMMCHEN

I understand perfectly.

PREYSING

What do you think your salary would

be -- for such a trip?

FLAEMMCHEN

Wait -- I must figure it up.

(she smokes and thinks)

First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes --

it's cold in England in March, I'll

need a suit... You'd want me to look

nice?

PREYSING

Of course -- of course.

(he is fidgeting)

FLAEMMCHEN

A thousand marks --

(she waits anxiously

thinking it might be

too much)

PREYSING

It's agreed -- I will get a room

here for you.

PREYSING

I can get a room here in the Grand

Hotel for you.

PREYSING

Can you pay some attention to me?

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh, yes.

PREYSING

(looking off)

Insolent young cub!

FLAEMMCHEN

You mean Baron von Gaigern?

PREYSING

Baron!

FLAEMMCHEN

Well, he's a gentleman!

BACK TO:

KRINGELEIN

(watching him)

The Baron is tired?

BARON

No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --

(he shrugs his

shoulders)

Well -- well --

KRINGELEIN

Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could

go to the Casino -- the place we

passed with the marvelous bright

lights?

BARON

I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't --

I am broke!

KRINGELEIN

Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --

BARON

I'm not going to get those pearls

and neither are you.

CHAUFFEUR

What about the money?

BARON

I'll pay you back.

CHAUFFEUR

How?

BARON

I have an idea working in my head...

(he glances at

Kringelein)

CHAUFFEUR

You might find a bullet through that

head...

BARON

If you did that, you'd get nothing

except the police after you. If you

wait -- I'll give you your six

thousand back --

I shall dance tonight -- How I shall

dance -- I want to feel that you are

in the theatre.

BARON

I can't.

GRUSINSKAYA

No?

BARON

No! I can't explain now. Oh, look --

the pearls. You wear them now...

GRUSINSKAYA

Why do you think --

BARON

Why?

GRUSINSKAYA

They've brought me such good luck --

you --

GRUSINSKAYA

I'm worried about you.

BARON

Don't.

GRUSINSKAYA

On the train?

BARON

Yes -- I will be on the train.

GRUSINSKAYA

Till then.

BARON

Bless you --

KRINGELEIN

Was the Baron joking, or is it really

true that the Baron is -- in financial

straits.

BARON

(lightly)

Absolutely true, Kringelein and I

have to raise some money immediately.

KRINGELEIN

If the Baron -- if you would permit

me --

BARON

What?

KRINGELEIN

I would be awfully glad to oblige,

you've been so decent to me. Three

hundred?

BARON

If I could get into a game I might

win some.

KRINGELEIN

Gambling! I'd like that. I have over

six thousand eight hundred marks

with me.

BARON

If we could scare up some men to

play.

KRINGELEIN

We could come to my room.

BARON

(with enthusiasm)

Good!

BARON

Going?

Yes --

I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you,

Baron and to win.

(he drinks)

It's good, -- come along, Baron.

BARON

I take five hundred.

KRINGELEIN

All of that at once, Baron?

BARON

Eight.

(he is triumphant.)

DOCTOR'S VOICE

(rings in background)

Nine.

BARON

That's it. The luck's with you.

(he walks away.)

VOICES

Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.

KRINGELEIN

I'm having luck for the first time

in my life.

A MAN

Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

DOCTOR

Out, Baron?

BARON

(bitterly)

For a while -- I'll recover -- in

ten or twenty years.

(he points)

Look at that.

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE

I've won again, Baron -- I've won

again.

KRINGELEIN

Baron, I drink and win -- I drink

and win -- I win and drink!

(he is pulling money

towards him, counting

it, eagerly,

frantically, not the

movement of a miser,

not a greedy movement,

but the movement of

an excited child

liberated. Money has

become so much mad

paper to him.)

A MAN

There are complaints in the hotel

about the noise.

VOICES

What time is it? Getting late? Let's

break it up!

(to Kringelein)

You've been very lucky... Where's my

coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!...

Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the

game, I'm broke and tired; you can't

play against him. I put my hat down

here, somewhere. I think I'll have a

drink before I go. By the way, I've

got to see you tomorrow morning.

How've you been, Doctor?

KRINGELEIN

Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a

while.

(he stands to his

feet)

Be my guests!

KRINGELEIN

I oughtn't to presume, but I --

(he is a little drunk)

I'm so grateful to you -- it's been

so marvelous. The first time in my

life I have gambled -- I've danced!

Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but

it's the first time in my life I've

ever tasted life!

A MAN

(slapping him on back)

Splendid!

KRINGELEIN

Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but

very dangerous. You must have courage

for it, then it's wonderful. You

gentlemen don't know that because

you are all healthy and happy, but I --

believe me -- a man must know death

and not until then does a man know

anything about life.

A MAN

(sings)

Rejoice in life while yet the small

lamp burns.

A MAN

(starts singing)

It's a short life and a gay one...

KRINGELEIN

(seizing a glass of

champagne)

Every glass high to life -- the

splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief --

brief life -- and the courage to

live it.

(turns to Baron)

Baron, you know -- I've only lived

since last night -- but that little

while seems longer than all the time

before -- all the --

(he collapses suddenly

onto the floor)

MAN

Drunk.

ANOTHER MAN

Poor fellow.

VOICES

(of players mingling)

Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill.

(well paused over:)

He's a doctor -- The doctor's here --

He's just drunk!

DOCTOR

Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very

ill -- if you will leave.

VOICES

Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight!

Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!

DRUNKEN MAN

He's not used to champagne -- why

does he drink it?

MAN

Can I help, doctor?

DOCTOR

No, the Baron will stay.

BARON

Certainly.

DOCTOR

(drops Kringelein's

hand)

It will be over in a minute.

KRINGELEIN

Over -- over so soon -- it has just

begun.

(he closes his eyes

suddenly)

Oh, the pain.

DOCTOR

Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be

afraid.

KRINGELEIN

(mutteringly)

I'd like to live a little longer but --

I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...

BARON

(touching his shoulder

gently)

You'll be all right, Kringelein.

(he moves from the

bed -- takes out a

cigarette, moves to

the table. He seizes

his drink)

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE

(out of scene)

My pocketbook... my money in it...

DOCTOR'S VOICE

What do you say -- what?

DOCTOR'S VOICE

You what -- Oh, isn't it there?

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE

No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost

my pocketbook.

DOCTOR

There is no pocketbook here... On

the floor probably.

(He glances down)

KRINGELEIN

(starting up suddenly)

More than fourteen thousand marks...

were in that pocketbook.

DOCTOR

(looking at Baron)

Fourteen thousand marks... One can

travel -- one's happiness might depend

on fourteen thousand marks -- don't

you think so, Baron?

BARON

(with a shrug)

Quite possibly.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, I've got to find it.

DOCTOR

Stay where you are.

KRINGELEIN

No -- I must find it --

(he starts talking)

Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.

(he pulls himself to

the side of the bed)

KRINGELEIN

I'm all right, Doctor. There's no

pain now -- only you don't know what

that money means to a man like me.

KRINGELEIN

(talking at intervals

as he crawls looking

for money)

You don't know, because you've never

lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and

saved and scrimped. My life hangs

upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives

you anything. You have to buy

everything and pay cash for it. I

wanted to pay for my last days with

that money. Every hour costs money.

I've nothing -- nothing but that

pocketbook.

(he crawls along the

floor on his hands

and knees talking to

the carpet as he

looks)

I must have it back.

(he pauses breathless --

like an animal along

the wall -- looking

up at the men)

DOCTOR

He must find his money, Baron.

(next time)

Mr. Kringelein should find his

pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?

BARON

Here -- here it is. Here's your

pocketbook, Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

(his head coming up)

Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found

it -- you found it for me, Baron.

BARON

(quickly)

Goodnight, Kringelein.

(he moves towards the

door.)

KRINGELEIN

No -- no please -- oh, don't go --

don't go -- don't leave me alone,

Baron.

DOCTOR

You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

KRINGELEIN

No.

BARON

Come, get up -- come let me help

you.

BARON

You're all right now -- it's very

late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

DOCTOR'S VOICE

Goodnight, Baron.

BARON

Goodnight.

(his hand presses on

Kringelein's shoulder --

he exits)

CUT OUT INTO:

BARON

Flaemmchen, what are you doing here

in the middle of the night.

FLAEMMCHEN

Looking for my room -- one sixty-

six.

BARON

You live here?

FLAEMMCHEN

For tonight.

(she points to door --

she looks at him a

long time)

BARON

Oh!

FLAEMMCHEN

Yes -- oh!

BARON

Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

FLAEMMCHEN

And Baron, thanks so much for

everything.

CUT TO:

PREYSING

Flaemmchen!

(he seizes her to him)

PREYSING

(breathlessly)

You are late. I've been waiting for

you -- waiting.

FLAEMMCHEN

I had to arrange about the trip.

PREYSING

You're sweet.

FLAEMMCHEN

You think so?

PREYSING

(awkwardly)

Come here.

(he sits heavily on

the bed, sitting on

her night dress.)

FLAEMMCHEN

Here, hold up!

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

PREYSING

Call me -- do you know -- would you --

would you like to call me by my first

name?

FLAEMMCHEN

(pulling away, glad

of an excuse for

conversation)

Oh, no.

PREYSING

Why not?

FLAEMMCHEN

I couldn't do that, you're a stranger

to me.

PREYSING

You're a funny little creature,

Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

FLAEMMCHEN

It's not funny at all. One can't get

intimate just off hand. I could go

to England with you and everything

like that -- supposing I met you

next year and I said: 'How do you

do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:

(she imitates him)

'That was the young lady who was my

secretary in Manchester'.

FLAEMMCHEN

That's all quite proper.

(she is happy again.

She would rather

talk than be squeezed)

But supposing I met you when you

were with your wife and I called

out: "Hello you big baby -- remember

Manchester?' And you with your wife,

how would you like that?

PREYSING

Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my

wife out of this.

FLAEMMCHEN

All right. I'll get undressed -- get

out.

PREYSING

Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want

here?

BARON

I must have made a mistake.

PREYSING

Made a mistake -- remarkable. We

shall soon see if you made a mistake.

(the Baron starts to

leave.)

(bellowing)

Stay here... Give me that money.

PREYSING

So that's how we stand, Baron.

BARON

Look here, sir -- I'm completely at

your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's

a matter of life or death -- I had

to get some money -- tonight.

PREYSING

Indeed you must, Baron -- you must.

Humm -- humm, but you must go to

jail, Baron, you're a thief.

BARON

Be quiet.

PREYSING

I'm going to call the police. I'm

going to watch you play the great

Baron with the police. Aristocrat!

Aristocrat!

(he picks up the

telephone)

PREYSING

The door is locked, Baron.

PREYSING

(into telephone)

Hello! Hello! --

BARON

Don't do that.

(he tries to snatch

the telephone from

Preysing.)

PREYSING

Strike me, would you? Attack me would

you? Attack me --

PREYSING

I'll strike you -- I'll strike you --

I'll strike you -- Strike me!

PREYSING

I strike you --

(with telephone

foolishly in his

hand, he looks down

at what he has done.)

CUT TO:

NIGHT GIRL

Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --

(she listens -- says

to herself)

They are having a nice little game

up there with the telephone.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FLAEMMCHEN

(hoarse whisper)

Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein --

where are you?

FLAEMMCHEN

Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- what -- what --

(he is looking up at

what seems to be a

ghost.)

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --

FLAEMMCHEN

Quick -- something awful -- awful

has happened. Go -- go at once, --

Mr. Preysing --

KRINGELEIN

Preysing?

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful --

it's awful.

KRINGELEIN

Stay here.

FLAEMMCHEN

Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.

KRINGELEIN

(calling)

Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --

CUT HIM THROUGH:

CUT INTO REVERSE:

KRINGELEIN

Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

PREYSING

He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

KRINGELEIN

My best friend -- poor, Baron --

dead -- just like that.

PREYSING

-- We must do something...

KRINGELEIN

(quickly)

Yes, the police must be called.

PREYSING

No -- no -- wait -- the man was a

burglar -- he was going to steal my

money.

KRINGELEIN

Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.

PREYSING

(suddenly)

Where is that girl -- she was working

with him -- she enticed me into her

room.

KRINGELEIN

Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing --

I understand, Mr. General Director

Preysing.

PREYSING

(frantically)

I can answer for this, it was self-

defense -- I can answer for this --

but that girl -- the scandal -- my

wife -- my daughters, you know them?

KRINGELEIN

Yes, I know them --

PREYSING

The scandal -- we are men -- you --

you could take that affair of the

young lady upon yourself -- take her

and hold your tongue. Then you can

travel -- I'll give you anything --

anything -- she was with you.

KRINGELEIN

We must call the police, your

excellency.

PREYSING

How much -- how much do you want --

you need money -- you have nothing.

KRINGELEIN

Don't worry about me, Mr. General

Director Pryesing -- worry about

yourself.

(he picks up receiver)

There has been a murder -- this is

room one sixty-four.

CUT TO:

GIRL

Hello -- hurry up... hurry up...

someone in one sixty-four says there

has been a murder.

CUT TO:

PORTER

Here - quick - here -- go to one

sixty-four immediately.

(calls back on

telephone)

Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the

manager.

CUT TO:

ROHNA

Where?... murder?... who?... all

right, I'm coming. Wait a minute.

(speaks in a monotone)

Instruct everyone to use the utmost

tact -- we must have no scandal in

the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions,

I'm coming now -- inform the police.

CUT TO:

SUZETTE

Madam should sleep.

GRUSINSKAYA

I've done my hair differently -- do

you like that?

SUZETTE

When a lady falls in love she does

her hair differently.

GRUSINSKAYA

(rising)

In the middle of the night -- those

flowers make me think of a funeral.

Laurels and tube-roses.

(she pushes the window

closed, shivers, it

is chilly. She crosses

the room turning out

one of the lights)

Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and

the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple --

happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.

SUZETTE

(quietly)

Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep.

It is not long 'till the train.

GRUSINSKAYA

Goodnight, Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA

Hello -- can you tell me if Baron

von Gaigern is in his room -- ring

him.

(talking to herself)

Cherie, I must wake you or you'll

miss the train.

(into phone)

...yes... are you ringing, he may be

asleep.

(to herself)

Cherie, you must get up and fetch me

from my room -- I'm longing for you,

Cherie -- I have not been to sleep --

I kept thinking you would come to

me.

(into phone)

...Oh, but he must answer. Ring --

ring -- ring.

CUT BACK TO:

GRUSINSKAYA

(to herself)

Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry.

Answer the phone -- what is the

matter.

(into phone)

Ring him -- ring him.

(to herself)

Where are you -- where are you,

Cherie? Why don't you answer?

(into phone)

Well, ring him -- please -- please.

CLERK

The night clerk has already gone --

you are late.

SENF

Man -- I was at the clinic the whole

night -- there are no words to

describe what my wife suffered.

CLERK

And the child isn't coming?

SENF

No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't

let it interfere with my duty. Any

news here?

CLERK

News? Yes -- killing in number one-

sixty-four.

SENF

What? -- Who? -- Whom?

CLERK

The big manufacturer killed Baron

von Gaigern.

SENF

Good heavens. What for?

CLERK

I don't know.

SENF

Man -- that's terrible. He was a

nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.

CLERK

It seems that he was a thief and an

imposter.

SENF

I don't believe it -- he was a real

gentleman. I know people... I'm so

tired I can hardly see out of my

eyes. No sleep for two nights and so

many duties and now this killing in

the hotel -- that means a lot of

work. But it's too bad about the

Baron, you always felt better when

he came along -- always friendly --

such an agreeable fellow.

CLERK

Most imposters are --

SENF

Good morning.

BOYS

(in chorus)

Good morning.

SENF

Show your hands.

SENF

(to one boy)

You have dirty nails -- you little

pig -- you're no good... Caps off! --

Let's see your hair.

(Boys take off their

caps)

Good -- caps on!

(Boys put on their

caps)

Where is number seven?... Not here?

(to clerk)

Take his name -- if he comes late

again today, he's fired. Dismissed!

KRINGELEIN

Please, officer.

OFFICER

That will be sufficient for the

present, sir, you may travel in peace.

CUT TO:

SUZETTE

And they've taken him away.

FLOOR CLERK

Yes -- it's terrible.

SUZETTE

Madam must not know -- you understand --

Madam must not know.

FLOOR CLERK

I will tell the maids. I cannot answer

for downstairs --

CUT TO:

KRINGELEIN

What's the matter?

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron --

Lying there, his eyes so open.

KRINGELEIN

You loved the Baron, didn't you?

FLAEMMCHEN

Yes --

KRINGELEIN

So did I. He was friendly to me as

no man ever was.

FLAEMMCHEN

Perhaps he really was a burglar --

But they don't kill a man for that.

KRINGELEIN

He was in desperate straits. He'd

been trying to raise money all day.

He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a

man like Preysing kills him.

FLAEMMCHEN

(naively)

I didn't like Preysing right off.

KRINGELEIN

Then why did you have anything to do

with him?

FLAEMMCHEN

(simply)

Money!

KRINGELEIN

Yes, of course, -- money!

FLAEMMCHEN

You don't understand that do you?

KRINGELEIN

Of course I do -- I never knew what

money really meant till I started

spending it. Do you know --

(he is silent a moment)

I can hardly believe that anything

so beautiful should come to me from

Preysing -- I'll take care of you.

Will -- will you let me?

FLAEMMCHEN

What?

KRINGELEIN

You'll have a good time with me.

Want to? I've got enough money. Ten

thousand two hundred in my pocketbook.

Three thousand four hundred that I

won. It will last a long time. I can

win more -- we'll travel.

FLAEMMCHEN

Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there

always.

KRINGELEIN

Wherever you like. Here I'll give

you the money I won, three thousand

four hundred. Later you can have

more.

FLAEMMCHEN

Later?

KRINGELEIN

When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It

will not be long -- I'll not last

long. Will you stay with me until...

FLAEMMCHEN

Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor,

he'll cure you. They can cure anything

these days.

KRINGELEIN

Do you believe that you will have a

better time with me than you would

with Preysing?

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh yes, of course.

KRINGELEIN

(takes her hands)

Do you like me better?

FLAEMMCHEN

You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein --

a very good man.

KRINGELEIN

(into telephone)

When is the next train leaving for

Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for

me... and my bill please... and the

lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.

(puts down telephone)

(to Flaemmchen)

We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll

have breakfast on the train.

CUT TO:

SUZETTE

Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is

waiting downstairs.

GRUSINSKAYA

Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?

(she looks off.)

PIMENOV

(breathlessly)

He will be on the train.

GRUSINSKAYA

But when did he go? How do you know?

GRUSINSKAYA

Baron von Gaigern has left?

GRUSINSKAYA

When? How long ago?

VOICE OF FLOOR CLERK

The Baron left about half an hour

ago, Madam.

PIMENOV

Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll

lose the train.

CUT TO:

VOICE

Madam Grusinskaya's car...

MEIERHEIM

Come along, oh, Madam, come along.

The train will be going.

GRUSINSKAYA

Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.

PIMENOV

What's the use of asking, Gru -- he

is at the train -- He will be there.

MEIERHEIM

The troupe, the scenery, everything --

all on board, waiting. You have a

rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning.

Come, Madam, are you mad?

GRUSINSKAYA

Have you seen Baron von Gaigern?

ROHNA

(comes over quickly)

The Baron is not here, Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA

He is gone?

ROHNA

Yes, Madam.

MEIERHEIM

Four minutes past. Please come.

PIMENOV

Come, Lisaveta, he will be there --

he will be there.

MEIERHEIM

Every seat for the opening has been

sold at Vienna. Sold out for three

days.

GRUSINSKAYA

I know -- I know -- but it will be

sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest

then.

SUZETTE

Yes, Madam.

Grand Hotel, Head Porter. What?

There's been -- a child born? A boy!

Yes! My child born! It is healthy...

The child has come. They are both

alive. My child...

KRINGELEIN

And now we travel, Flaemmchen...

Glad?

FLAEMMCHEN

Am I!

KRINGELEIN

(to Senf)

Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?

SENF

At once. Any forwarding address, Mr.

Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN

Yes, Paris -- Grand Hotel.

FLAEMMCHEN

How do you know there is a Grand

Hotel?

KRINGELEIN

Oh, there must be one in Paris...

They have everything in Paris.
