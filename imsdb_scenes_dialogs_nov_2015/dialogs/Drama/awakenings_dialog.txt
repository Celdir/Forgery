1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset.

Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors

are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling

the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences

him with a look.

\      '

Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural

rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen

across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined

than the last, until they begin melding together into what

resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean

waves.

The teacher resumes chalking on the board. The boy from the

train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the

rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean

waves," to form recognizable letters.and words.

The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the

irritating noise. The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing

again becomes formless.

5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930

The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at

play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,

He circles offending errors on the last page of the last

composition book. He scribbles a grade opposite the student's

name in a grade book. He notices the absence of a grade in

Leonard's column.                         .

Leonard's desk. The teacher locates the missing composition

book buried under textbooks. He takes it back to his own desk,

opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or

rather Leonard's illegible representation of it.

He considers earlier lessons in the book. He begins to see in

the script a pattern of deterioration. He reaches the last

entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning

In "the waves."

6.   INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER

The painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime

novels. The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight.

Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house:

BOY'S VOICE

When can I see him?

WOMAN'S VOICE

When he's well.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)   Pg.3

When will he be well?

WOMAN'S VOICE

I don't know.

FADE TO BLACK

OPERATOR

Yes?

SAYER

When you say people ... you mean

living people,                 .

DIRECTOR

Living people, yes.   Patients.

There's some mistake. And Sayer's chair begins to feel more *

A doctor ... doctor.

The Camel Institute. Tell me                                *

about that, anything with patients                          *

Earthworms.

DIRECTOR

Sorry?                               ,

SAYER

It was an immense project. "

I was trying to extract a decigram

of myelin from four tons of

earthworms.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)         Pg.5

7.C0NT.              DIRECTOR                                          7.

(pause)

Really.

SAYER

I was on it for five years.

I was the only one who really

believed in it. The rest of them

said it couldn't be done.                         t

KAUFMAN

It can't.

SAYER

Well, I know that now.       I proved

it.

The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the

resume again.

DIRECTOR

Maybe before. At Saint Thomas.

(Sayer is already

shaking his head no)

All research. Earth - ?

SAYER

Pigs brains . . . theyre quite

similar to human brains.

DIRECTOR

(hopefully)

Are they?

SAYER

Oh, yes . . . three years.

As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against

hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to

a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business

being here. He should leave.

SAYER

Excuse me, I made a mistake coming

here. Clearly you're looking for

someone with more of a clinical

background.

He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out.      But the       *

director keeps searching the resume.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)        Pg.6

I've taken enough of your time.

You must have a hundred applicants

more suitable.

KAUFMAN

Thanks anyway.

DIRECTOR

Back in medical school ...

DIRECTOR

I mean, you couldn't have

graduated without some clinical

experience. .

DIRECTOR

Well, there we are, doctor.

DIRECTOR

(not far from                 v

begging)

You do want the job, don't you?

ANTHONY O.S.

Spent much time in chronic

hospitals, doctor?

FEMALE PATIENT 1

Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . . .

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)               pg.7

(to Sayer)

You'd remember.

SAYER

I guess not.

ANTHONY

Hey, how you doing?

(calling to someone

down the hall)

Dr. Sullivan.

OLD PATIENT

Fn ...

ie

ANTHONY

Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer;

' ': : '                      '   -'.

There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's

SULLIVAN

Not the neurologist, that'd be

asking too much. You're not the

neurologist.

SAYER

I think I am.

SULLIVAN

Well, come on, Anthony, get him a

coat for Christ's sake.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)        Pg.7

To examine you.

MRS. COHEN

Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My

son's coming to take me home.

on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her

and crosses the room to a nurse.

SAYER

Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son.

He's coming today?

NURSE 1

I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't

for twenty years.

The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen,

trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his

discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the

ribbon from her hair.

14.    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE- LATER - DAY

Silence. Institutional beige walls. Glass cabinets, locked,

containing medical instruments. A metal examination table with

leather straps.

Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still

unsettled from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he

gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it.

It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way,

sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash over his face as

he stares out absently at children on an elementary school

playground beyond a debris-strewn field.

MISS COSTELLO O.S.

(a matter of fact)

It gets easier.

Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head

nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all.

She's standing in the doorway.

MISS COSTELLO

You don't think it will, but it

does.

A moment and she A urns and leaves.

14A.   EXT. TENEMENT (LUCY'S) - ESTABLISH - DAY

SAYER'S VOICE

SAYER'S VOICE

Do you know where you are?

(nothing back)

Do you remember being brought

here?

Do you know what has happened?

Can you hear me?

Her name is Lucy Fishman . . .

SAYER'S VOICE

She was found by neighbors with                               *

her sister, several days after the ,

sister had died . . .

SAYER (CONT'D)

According to the neighbors,                                    *

she's never set foot outside her                               *

relatives, and has always been the                             *

way she is now - without any                                   *

comprehension or response.                                     *

SAYER

And yet . . .

DR. KAUFMAN

A reflex.

SAYER

If she batted it away I might call

that a reflex. She doesn't bat it

away, she catches it.

DR. KAUFMAN

-        It's still a reflex.

...    :         ' . " .'

SAYER

I'm sorry, if you were right I'd

agree with you.

SAYER

It's as if . . . having lost all

will of her own on which to act,

she borrows the will of the ball.

DR. TYLER

The "will of the ball?"

.

DR. SULLIVAN

Excuse me.

DR. KAUFMAN                                 .       I

(hopefully)

You're trying to make a good

impression. That's it, isn't it?

You're still settling in.

Sayer isn't sure if he should agree or not.   He does neither.

DR. KAUFMAN

Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr.

Saver's patients waiting out there

are rescheduled for tomorrow?

MISS COSTELLO

Yes, sir.

DR. KAUFMAN

Good night.

Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy,

looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one,

doesn't.

18.   EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

-*     recites in a mumble to himself --

SAYER

One . . .                                                  .

'park')

Five.

Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his

window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears

at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.

SAYER

What'd I forget?

MISS COSTELLO

I just wanted to say to you I

preferred your explanation.

()   It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.

MISS COSTELLO

And that I'll look after things

for you until you've "settled in."

Good night, doctor.

She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his

dashboard. To it eventually, quietly --

SAYER

Thank you . . .

He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away

toward her car. To the reflection --

SAYER

Thank you very much.

18A. EXT. SAMMY'S FISH GROTTO - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             18A.

19.   INT. SAMMY'S GROTTO, CITY ISLAND, THE BRONX - NIGHT     19.

Sayer at a table eating dinner alone. He should've brought

along something to read. He glances at the little "Catch of

the Day" notice on his table for the tenth time, then absently

in at an eel in a fish tank, which seems to be peering back out

at him.

SIDNEY V.O.

I am not mad ... not mad . . .

20.   EXT. SCHOOLYARD & BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - DAY                 20.

A tether ball dangling from a rope, resting against a pole.

The chains of a swing. Pigeons scavenging scraps on the

asphalt of the elementary school playground, deserted.

SIDNEY V.O.

I know the difference between what

is real and what is not . . .

Beyond a chain-link fence, across the field, on the roof of one

of Bainbridge's brick buildings, peering down from the edge of

it, coat over his smock, hat on his head, an elderly man.

21.   INT. SIDNEY'S DAYROOM - DAY                                   21.

Tight on the elderly man's face.

SIDNEY

The voice was real.

REV.12/12/89 (PINK)      Pg.14

SAYER

What did the voice say?

SIDNEY

"Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat,

go up to the roof and jump off."

SAYER

Did you recognize it as belonging

to a person? Or was it just a

voice?

*

SIDNEY

You don't deny it was you.                                  *

SAYER

*

Me?

' '  * SAYER '        .

I do deny it. It wasn't me.

It wasn't real.

(pause)

We've only just now met, sir.

SIDNEY

If that's true . . . I'm in a

predicament.

DR. SULLIVAN

We'd be high up - 40th, 50th

floor, nice midtown view - suite                            *

DR. SULLIVAN

We could have all that ... but

we'd miss all this. We'd miss        the

wards.

DR. TYLER

The smell of them.

DR. SULLIVAN

We'd miss this place -

(this cafeteria)

We'd miss this . . .

(the plate of mush as

it's set down onto

his tray)

Whatever this is.        .

SAYER

Ye ....

s

Sayer glances up at them, having paid attention to nothing

they've said, and nods at some other thought.

.        '    SAYER

Yes . . .    ,'

He leaves his tray where he stands, and heads out of the

cafeteria.                                 v

23.   INT. SIDNEY'S DAYROOM - DAY                                23.

Sayer back with Sidney.

SAYER

Did you see me when-1 "spoke?"

Sidney thinks about it, tries to remember, to summon back the

moment in question, to picture it exactly as it happened, or

didn't happen.

SIDNEY

No.

SAYER

You see me now though.

SIDNEY

Yes.

REV. 10/13/89   p. 17

He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper.

waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move.

Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket,

hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go.

The man, lightning quick, catches it.

25.   INT. ANOT HE R DAYRO OM ( B) - L ATE R - DAY                           2 5.

Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a

television set with a horizontal hold problem.

Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set,

corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's "attention"

slowly drifts away. Sayer "read       justs" it, gets the jumping

horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return.

26.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY                                . 26.

Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands

before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs.

It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement

of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness.

Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an

abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the

others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems,

to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone

again.

- ."

He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain

across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that

has arrested her progress. He moves the table.

In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And

another. And another before encountering and being "blocked"

by an empty wheelchair. She stops.

Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her

path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the

fountain before mysteriously stopping again.

Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers

in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the

fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her.

Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost"

(LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive.

"At" Sayer.

27.   INT. FILE ROOM, BAINBRIDGE - DAY                            27

BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS

STATE OF NEW YORK

A typed date / AUGUST 2, 1929. The admitting physician's name.

The patient's name. And age / 15. An identification number

and ward assignment number.

As Sayer pulls the folder and closes the drawer of one of

several filing cabinets lining the walls of a claustrophobic

room, Miss Costello slides open another, locates a particular

folder in it and in the folder another admitting form -- The

date / MAY 7, 1932. Names and numbers.

Another drawer. Sayer pulling another folder. Another

admission form ~ Date / DECEMBER 12, 1930. Age of the patient

/ 22.

28.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY

The files spread out on a table. Sayer and Miss Costello

leafing through them.                    .

.

Sayer considers one's original admission forms. He scans

bodies of text and finds a diagnosis -- ATYPICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA.

He sets it aside and picks up another.

MISS COSTELLO

"Atypical Hysteria," this one.

Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually

finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of

the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He

turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns

the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44."

SAYER

There must be more recent files we

missed somehow. "Part Twos" to

their medical histories.

(Miss Costello is

shaking head 'no.')

In some other filing cabinet

somewhere.                 . ..

MISS COSTELLO

NO.

29.   EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - EVENING                               29.

SAYER

One would think that after a point

enough atypical somethings would

amount to a typical something.

But a typical "what?"

Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what

SAYER

They all survived encephalitis

years before they came here. In

SAYER

The New England Journal of

Medicine, April 6th, 1935.                                    *

OLD DOCTOR

(philosophically

detached)

Pus and pain, that's the final                                *

reward. Pus and pain and

obscurity.

OLD DOCTOR                .

I believe you when you say some

still live. But I can assure you

they're medically irrelevant. As

they were thirty years ago when I

fought to get my work published.

OLD DOCTOR

That's the problem with a unique

disease. Once it no longer rages,

I'm telling you, it becomes very

unfashionable.         .

OLD DOCTOR

What would I be without this

thing? A man with a1 shred of

dignity le_ft.

SAYER

Should I get your nurse?

OLD DOCTOR

God forbid, no.

OLD DOCTOR

How many have you found there?

SAYER

Five. So far. I think there may

be more.

OLD DOCTOR

How are they?

SAYER

As you described them. As they

were back then. As "insubstantial

as ghosts." Only I guess most of

them were children then.

OLD DOCTOR

Yes.   Children who fell asleep.

Boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage, the

emphysema-plagued doctor's post-encephalitic research, files

and photographs and cans of 16mm film.

OLD DOCTOR

Most died during the acute stage

of the illness, during a sleep so

deep they couldn't be roused. A

sleep that in most cases lasted

several months.

The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage

projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell -

a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping

open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from

invisible strings.

OLD DOCTOR

Those who survived, who awoke,

seemed fine, as though nothing had

happened. Years went by - five,

ten, fifteen - before anyone

suspected they were not well. .

They were not.

A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the

subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.

OLD DOCTOR

I began to see them in the early

1930's - old people brought in by

their children, young people

brought in by their parents - all

of them complaining they weren't

"themselves" anymore. They'd

grown distant, aloof, anti-social,

they daydreamed at the dinner

table. I referred them to

psychiatrists.

The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal-

shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside.

They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to

perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to

paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.

who seems composed less of flesh than wax, a wax figure with

On the screen, the young man's eyes, entranced, gaze upward as

if trying hard to remember something. Or trying hard to forget

it.

79.   INT. PHARMACY, BAINBRIDGE - DAY

The hospital pharmacy, a subterranean structure built into the

basement, cluttered from floor to ceiling with medicines.

Ray, the pharmacist, dips into a bag of powder. He spoons some

out onto a scale and looks to Sayer to tell him the dosage.

SAYER

I have no idea. What do you say

we ease into it with ... what,       .

fifty milligrams?

Ray begins to measure five milligrams.

SAYER

Let's say a hundred.

Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder,

removing all but 100 milligrams.

SAYER

Leonard? Your mother's going to

give you some juice. There's

medicine in it which is why it may

taste more bitter than usual.

Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it

all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually

drains the liquid down his throat.

Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the

exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe

hands the empty glass back to Sayer.

And they all wait.

A tray of truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer

and Miss Costello, watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush-

like concoction and manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into

his mouth. He seems amazed by its flavor.

LEONARD

It's delicious.

FERNANDO

I wouldn't go that far, Len.

Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the

others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles.

MISS COSTELLO

losing 3D years of my life. I

can't even imagine it.

He hesitates, as if saying it may make the fear more real.

SAYER

. . . you'll sleep. And when you

wake up in the morning, it will be

the next morning. I promise.

Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen

just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his

mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs.

Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby.

100.   INT. ROOM ADJACENT TO EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING                             100.

Sayer comes in with some books, sets them on Miss Costello's

desk and crosses to a closet.

SAYER

I didn't sleep, did you?

MISS COSTELLO

Does it look like it?                   .

Sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat.

SAYER

Do you know if Leonard's awake?

She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room.

101.   INT. THE EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING                                              101.

Showered and shaved and groomed and bright-eyed, Leonard sits

listening to his own heartbeat with Sayer's stethoscope.

Coming in --

i      SAYER

Good morning.

LEONARD

Good morning.     .

His speech is still rather flat, halting.,

SAYER

Been waiting for me long?

LEONARD

Yes.

REV. 10/13/89 p.55

Sayer smiles.    He hands Leonard the books.   History books. An

almanac.

SAYER

Some things have happened while

you've been away. I thought you'd

be interested.

Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading

from it to himself.

SAYER

You don't have to read them now,

Leonard. They're yours. At your

leisure.

Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like

they're gold.

LEONARD

I used to read quite a lot.

.

Before.

SAYER i

Yes, I know.      .

LEONARD

Thank you for these.

i                       .

Sayer nods that he's welcome.

SAYER

Have you thought about what you'd

like to do today?

LEONARD

Everything.

SAYER

(smiles)

I'm not sure I can arrange that.

LEONARD

Try.

Sayer smiles again. For a man who just yesterday learned he

has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard

seems to have recovered extraordinarily.

SAYER

Let's approach it this way. What              . ".

LEONARD

I'd like to go outside.

102.   EXT. PARKING LOT, BAINBRIDGE - MORNING                      102

Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard,

resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to

buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as

Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary,

apparently, to make the car go.

The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of

one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out --

Leonard's mother.

103.   INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING                         103

Tight on the radio. Sayer switches it on. To Leonard's

amazement, classical music fills the interior

and CONTINUES OVER:

104.   EXT. THE BRONX - MOVING SHOTS - MORNING                     104

Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers.

Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale.

"Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations.

"Futuristic" cars.

Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to

the world and stares at it all with wonder. Everywhere he

looks there is something "extraordinary."

LEONARD

What a wonderful place The Bronx

has become.

The music CONTINUES OVER:

''   '                           *

105.   INT/EXT. NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY                   105

A rose.       ,

Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance.

He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly

astonished by the tactile sensation.

Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real

world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the

purity or intensity Leonard can.

Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of

countless thousands of roses.

109

R!V. 10/13/89   p.58

Boats and fish markets and lush vegetation. Paradise compared

to the Bronx. The Toyota turns down a side road near the water         t

and into the driveway of Sayer's small wooden house.

And the mus ic ends.

112.   INT. SAYER'S KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - DAY                       112.

Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter.

Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing

boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can

offer his guest.

He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the

dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the

spines of books. Noticing Sayer watching -

LEONARD

You just moved here.

SAYER

Yeah. Well, five years ago.                                 ,

Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before            ;

peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i

framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn

expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a

photography studio prop.

LEONARD

Your son?

SAYER

Me, actually.

'      ,,"                     t

LEONARD

(looking closely at                              '

the photograph)

You seem uncomfortable.

SAYER

I probably was.

Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later

.

glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved

over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are

neatly arranged.

/

SAYER

Each has a specific purpose.

REV. 10/13/89   p.59

As Leonard considers each pair of glasses ...

SAYER

Those are my normal interior

glasses. And spare pair. Those,

I wear outside. Two pairs, in

case I los.e one. Those, those are

my daytime reading glasses. And

spare. Those are for close work.

For fine print. Those are my

nighttime reading glasses -

Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely.

SAYER

That's heavy-gauge metal so when I

fall asleep and roll over on them

I don't wreck them. They're

indestructible.

Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place

and considers them all together.

SAYER

As long as I pretty much know

ahead of time what I'll be looking '

at, it works out, I don't have to

carry all five pairs around.

LEONARD

What if you just want to go for a

walk?

SAYER

(pause)

Walks are a problem. Walks are

the hardest thing. You just never

know.

He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an

imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before

reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and

some saltine% on a tray.

SAYER

I hope you'll forgive the

inelegant presentation. I don't

entertain much.       /       .

REV. 10/13/89 p.60

SAYER

I can date my interest in science

precisely, actually. I'd been                                   *

sent off to boarding school - a

place perhaps not quite as

Dickensian as I remember it - when

I happened to come across the

periodic table of elements.

(smiles at the

thought)

I memorized it. Which I admit was

a rather precocious thing for a

seven year old to do. And I

remember feeling . . . not so much a

sense of accomplishment . . . as

comfort. The halogens were what

they were. The alkali metals were

what they were. Each element had

its place, and nothing could                                    *

change that. They were secure, no                               *

matter what.                                                    *

Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than                      *

understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little             *

exposed.

LEONARD

:

You're not married.

SAYER

No.

SAYER

I'm not terribly good with people.

I like them. I wish I could say I

had more than a rudimentary

understanding of them.

Maybe if they were less

unpredictable . . .

SAYER

Miss Costello.

SAYER

Oh, yes, of course.

(uneasy)

She's spoken to you about me?

Leonard nods. Sayer can't imagine why, nor what she might have

said. Fearing the worst --

SAYER

What'd she say?

LEONARD           '

That you're a kind man. That you

care very much for people.

Sayer shifts in his chair uncomfortably.

But you meant normal people.

Sayer seems at a loss as to how to respond.   The accompanying

Sayer crosses over to the sideboard, to the pairs of glasses,

stares at them for several moments, and picks up two pairs.

Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen.

Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished'

meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and

Kaufman at a table near the door.

KAUFMAN

we talking about?

To put them all on the dosage Mr.

Lowe is on . . . about twenty

thousand dollars.

Kaufman stares at Sayer aghast. He knew L-Dopa was expensive,

but not that expensive. He manages to recover somewhat.

KAUFMAN

That would be for how long?

SAYER

About a month.

KAUFMAN

A month?

Sayer nods. Kaufman glances away.   Stares blankly at faces at

other tables. Back to Sayer.

KAUFMAN

I can't go before the board with

that. I could . . .

He laughs to himself at the futility of it.

SAYER

I was thinking of speaking to the

patrons.

KAUFMAN

The few patrons this hospital has

give what they can.

SAYER

Well, we'd have to convince them

to give more than they*re

accustomed to giving.

He hadn't intended as impudent a tone as that which came out.

silence around them. No one is talking. He glances    up as Miss

Costello walks by setting something on the table in   front of

him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word.

made out in her name. Kaufman turns it over. She has endorsed

it back to Bainbridge Hospital.

Fernando walks by and    out, leaving his salary check on the

table. Then Ray, the    pharmacist, leaving his. Then the nurse

who reluctantly read    "Moby Dick" to the patients. Then a

cafeteria worker. A     secretary. A clerk. A janitor.

The cafeteria is soon empty, except for Sayer and Kaufman.

Long silence.

8mm film of Leonard before L-Dopa -- a wide shot of him

absolutely motionless in his wheelchair.

SAYER O.S.

There was extreme rigidity of the

axial musculature . . . only vague

available motion in the neck . . .

no voluntary movement in the

limbs . . .

A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen.

Perhaps most striking was the

profound facial masking -- which

we now know should not have been

confused with apathy.         *

Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his

In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of

Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near

Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note.

"Less scientific" it reads.

SAYER

Isolated circumstances -- the

mention of his name, notes of

particular pieces of music, the

touch of another human being --

managed on occasion to briefly

summon him, but these awakenings

were rare and transient, lasting

only a moment or two.

SAYER

The rest of the time he remained

in a profoundly eventless place ~

deprived of all sense of history

and happening and self --

encysted, cocooned, enveloped in

this metaphorical if not

physiological equivalent of sleep

. . . or death.

Sidney and Lolly emerge from the dayroom, followed by the other

post-encephalitics. They're all wearing suits and dresses and

walk with purpose past wheelchair-bound patients with

They're going on a field trip. As they're escorted onto an

idling hospital bus, Leonard, outside it, tries to reason with

his mother:

MRS. LOWE

Sidney's going.

He's a patient, Mom.

LEONARD

He's still a patient.       You're not

a patient.

MRS. LOWE

I'm your mother.

Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver

to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and

turns away.

MRS. LOWE

Wait a minute.

(he turns back)

What on earth have you done to

your hair?

He's parted it, apparently, on the "wrong" side. She pulls a

comb from her purse, recombs it "correctly," straightens his

jacket lapels and steps back.                          '

MRS. LOWE

There.

LEONARD

There's your bus.                .

The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she

hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus.

SAYER

Ready?

LEONARD

I've decided not to go.

He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him.

LEONARD

I'm staying here.

SAYER

Why? What's wrong?

LEONARD

Nothing. Wave.

He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus.

Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks

the horn again.

Roseland's Big Band belting out "That Old Black Magic."

On the dancefloor, the post-encephalitics dance with one

another amidst "normal" middle-aged and older couples, all

having a great time.

At the bar, Sayer tries to get the attention of a young

bartender busy mixing drinks. Watching, it slowly dawns on

Rose that something is "wrong" here. More to herself -

ROSE

It's legal again?

MISS COSTELLO

For some time now.

Rose is delighted; she can hardly believe it.      She gets the

Miss Costello doesn't know who she could possibly mean. She

Sayer sitting alone.

MISS COSTELLO

Not that I know of. I kind of

doubt it.

Rose gets up and crosses toward Sayer. Seeing her coming, he

smiles ... but the smile slowly begins to fade as she sings to

him:

ROSE

You made me love you

I didn't want to do it

I didn't want to do it . . .

Singing as she does it, she pulls him out of his chair.

Embarrassed, he resists, but she finally gets on the dance

floor. Never more mortified in his life (it seems as if

everyone is watching) he "dances . . . "

LEONARD

I am?

(Kaufman's shrug says

"of course")

Alone?

Now there's a pause. And Leonard's hand makes a gesture to his *

face, to his brow. He ignores it (or is unaware of it).        *

KAUFMAN

What difference does that make?

LEONARD

(pause)

I think you know.

KAUFMAN

I don't know. Tell me.

LEONARD

(right back)

It makes all the difference.

He brushes at his brow again. Sayer studies him, or rather the

tic itself as it repeats.

Mr. Lowe? I wonder . . . are you

hostility you're exhibiting

towards us right now?                                   *

Kaufman glances over to the psychiatrist, weary. The look on *

Leonard's face is complete innocence; and his tone completely *

without innuendo -

LEONARD

How could I be aware of something

that's unconscious?              *

Sayer smiles to himself. So does Kaufman. The psychiatrist *

doesn't.                                                  **

if you were me?

KAUFMAN

straining)

I ' m hot you. Enlighten me.

I ' d walk around. I ' d talk to

people, I ' d look at things. I' d

decide whether I wanted to go this

way, or that way, or keep going

straight. I ' d do the things you

do everyday and take for granted.

Long silence. Then:

I'll tell you what, we'll take it

under consideration. We'll let

you know.

Leonard at a table. Waiting. Sayer appears. Sits.

LEONARD

Yeah, I was aware of it.

(the tic)

I was nervous. It's nothing.

What'd they say?

SAYER

They said it's a dangerous place

out there. They said they can't

be held responsible for what might

happen to you out there. They

said no.

Leonard nods, sips his coffee, seems to take the decision in

stride.

LEONARD

And what did you say?

SAYER

They don't have to listen to me.

LEONARD

Did you agree with them?

SAYER

(pause)

Yes.

SAYER

I ' m not sure we're out of the

this is nothing.

unlocks that one.

An old black and white musical blaring from a television bolted

to the ceiling. Young male patients, subdued with Thorazine,

vacantly staring at it.                   >

Sayer comes in, finds Leonard in one of the chairs, and kneels

to gain some confidentiality. Leonard cranes slightly to see

around him, to see the television.

SAYER

This is a mistake. It's wrong

and it's cruel and it should never

have happened like this - but you

have to understand - nothing quite

like this has happened before, no

one knows what to do . . . Leonard,

please don't ignore me.

Leonard condescends a look to him. A moment and Sayer smiles

at a thought:                        ,

Leonard paces before the entire Ward 5 population, gathered

like the blind and the sick under a revivalist's tent.

LEONARD

It isn't us that's defective,

it's them. We're not in crisis,

they are. We've been through the

worst that can happen to a person

and survived it. They haven't.

They fear it. And they hide from

their fear by hiding us, because

they know, they know . . .

LEONARD

How long have you been here?            *

(the man shrugs)

You don't know? A month, a year?               .

He doesn't know that, either. To another patient:

LEONARD                -

How do you feel being locked up?

WARD 5 PATIENT

I don't like it.

LEONARD

You don't like it? Aren't you an

animal?

WARD 5 PATIENT

I'm no animal.

LEONARD

Then why are you in a cage?

The man's getting agitated . . . they all are. Leonard stops

pacing, faces them, and almost whispers:

LEONARD

Anger . . .

REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW)           Pg.9

without the ability to release his

anger -

KAUFMAN              t

Really - and his tics and

paranoia? They're more natural - ;

SAYER

He's in that place.

KAUFMAN

Oh, is that it -

SAYER

We wake him up, then lock him up,

that's not "paranoia," that's a

fact.

KAUFMAN

I've got 20 psychotics up there,

"doctor," refusing to eat. They

have no idea whv they're refusing

to eat. How long should I let

that go (on) -

SAYER

He knows why, hs. wants out.

REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW)       Pg.9

Hell, so do I.

Kaufman suddenly looks weary, as if all his years in this place

have finally, at this moment, caught up with him. Eventually,

calmly, evenly -

KAUFMAN

Mr. Lowe is not the Messiah of

Ward 5, he's a man in trouble. He

wasn't "resurrected," he was

administered a drug - by. you -

that's fallen somewhat short of

its "miraculous" reputation -

SAYER      .

The others are fine, they show no

signs of -

KAUFMAN

He's been OQ it longer!

Sayer has no rejoinder. A silence before:

KAUFMAN              .

I sympathize with him. I've

tried to accommodate him. But                       .

I will not let him endanger the

health of other patients.

He's resolute; it feels like a threat, or ultimatum. Trying t

remain calm, Sayer changes tacks -

SAYER

I'll talk to him, I'll      explain t he

problem. He'll listen       to (m e) -

(Kaufman has to

laugh)

Without the drug, he's    dead.

and then the slightest, slightest shrug.

H er voice C ONTINUES t he verse O VER: Rose, her sad stra nge

china doll face.

ROSE

You'd never know it now, but I

used to be so pretty, Dr. Sayer,

even you would've thought so.

SAYER

I do think so.

She shakes her head 'no.1   She knows what she looks like.

MAGDA O.S.

What if he's just had enough

of it?

Sayer glances to Magda, nearby with a group of other patients,

some of them looking off toward the sunroom where Leonard,

alone, at a window, stares out.

FRANCIS

What if it's just a matter of

time for all of us?

SAYER

:

There's no reason to think

any of this will happen to you.

You're individuals. And you're

all well.

(pause)

Aren't you?

Most nod, but it's without great conviction.

BERT

He's the strongest of us.

Close on Lucy/ across the room with Miss Costello, finishing

the song:

LUCY

Comes love's old sweet song . . .

Her voice trails into silence.

Drifting across Leonard's dosage schedules, minute milligram

changes leading to vanishing point of health, across the scale,-

with nothing on it, and reaching, finally, Sayer, alone in the

room, surrounded by racks of medicine and no solution.

They

He glances up. Mrs. Lowe has appeared in the doorway,

consider each other for a long moment before:

MRS. LOWE

When my son was born healthy,

I never asked why. Why was I sp

lucky, what did I do to deserve

this perfect child, this

perfect life? -

Silence. Her face toughens.

MRS. LOWE

But when he got sick, you can bet

I asked why. I demanded to know

why. Why was this happening?

Silence. Then with an almost philosophical shrug:

MRS. LOWE

There was nothing I could do

about it. There was no one I

could go to and say, "Stop this,

please stop this, can't you see

my son is in pain?"

SAYER

He's fighting, Mrs -

MRS. LOWE

He's losing.

REV.12/5/89 (BLUE)   Pg.

MRS. LOWE

The truth is . . . I wouldn't mind

if he lost . . .

(long pause)

I know you can't understand how I

could say such a thing . . .

MRS. LOWE

But we were happy before.

LEONARD

I can't read anymore. The words

are written too slow. I keep

going back to the beginning, to

the beginning, and trying . . .

LEONARD

I've let the others down.

SAYER

You have not.

( LEONARD

I've let you down.

SAYER

You have not.

LEONARD

I'm grotesque . . . grotesque . . .

LEONARD

-

19 7.

He is a man consumed by illness. With a voice that is flat and

w*    limbs that are bent and hands that are twisted and a grimace

that can only hint at the great depth of the despair he is

suffering.

LEONARD

Look at me and tell me I am not.

SAYER

You are not.

It's over and Leonard knows it. And though he won't admit it,

so does Sayer. Leonard barely gets the words out --

LEONARD

This . . . isn't . . . me.

198.   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                     198.

Standing before a mirror above a sink, Leonard struggles to

part his hair straight. He's wearing his best clothes, those

he wears when he's seeing Paula, but they seem to drape

awkwardly.

199.   INT. PATIENTS' CAFETERIA - DAY                             199.

He may not have looked like a patient when Paula first met him,

but he does now. It's all she can do to not break down in

front of him.                               >

REV. 10/2/89

PAULA

.. I worked . . . I had friends

about it . . .

Leonard, ticcing, nods, smiles through his grimace, imagining

those things.

PAULA

I know, I should do something with

my life.

LEONARD

Like what? Those are great

things. I've never done any of

those things.

PAULA

You will.

Leonard shakes his nead 'no.'

LEONARD

They'll never let me out of this

place. They shouldn't.

They consider each other for several moments -- the one, young

and healthy; the other, old and ill.

LEONARD

I'm not well. I feel well inside

when I see you. I wish you could

see what's inside. Instead of

this.

PAULA

I can see it.

Silence. As much as Leonard wants to say "I love you," he

knows he cannot, that it would be ludicrous. Instead:

LEONARD

Goodbye.

He ho lds out o ne of his sh aking han ds to her. S he reach es to

it, places her hand on it, holds it, and the shaking slowly,

slowly, slowly begins to subside.

She lifts him gently out of his wheelchair and leads him away    *

from the table. She arranges his arms in such a way that he is

sort of holding her and begins to slowly dance with him.

199. CONT.                                                 .                             199.

Some patients glance      up from their       food.        Ser   vers glance up

dancing without music     . They watch        as Leo   n   ard   's tics gradually

disappear. They watc      h as he finds      a sens    e    of    grace and ease,

as he borrows her gra     ce and ease.        They w   a   tch    him become,

simply, a man dancing      with a woman     .

From somewhere, perhaps imagined, there is music, a quiet

melody played on a piano.

room. He's bent, his arms at strange angles like the limbs of

a diseased tree, his legs managing each step only with great

concentration.

He nears the center of the room, the area of inconsistent tiles

which Sayer and Miss Costello long ago conformed with shoe

polish. Some of the black has worn off, and as Leonard reaches                            *

Everyone in the room except Rolando becomes acutely aware of

the problem, of the struggle, of Leonard fighting with all his

will, and nothing but it, to "cross over."

been away for quite some time.

Tight on Sayer,- alone in the darkened room, watching the

footage, watching Leonard wrestling with the thought.

LEONARD (FILM)

I'm back.

Light moves across the screen. Someone has entered. Miss

Costello. She exchanges a long glance with Sayer before they

both look back to the screen.

LEONARD (FILM)

I thought it was a dream at first.

Silence except for the sound of the projector.   Then -

SAYER'S VOICE (FILM)

When did you realize it wasn't?

Leonard thinks back, trying to recall the exact moment he

realized he was "alive.n Finally --

LEONARD (FILM)

When I spoke and you understood

me.

One tear snakes down Saver's cheek. The film cuts to silent

footage of Leonard, soon after his awakening, combing his hair

and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it.

Quietly, without looking at Miss Costello --

SAYER

You told him I was a kind man ...

(long pause)

It's kind to give life only to

take it away?

There is self-loathing in his voice. On the screen, Leonard's

trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive.

MISS COSTELLO

It's given and taken away from

all of us.

On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up

smiling, proud. Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector

light flickering behind him. More to himself --

SAYER

Why doesn't that comfort me?

MISS COSTELLO

(quietly)

Because you are kind.

(pause)

And because he's your friend.

LEONARD O.S.

His voice is flat, inflectionless. His eyes, with little life

behind them, staring at the falling snow. He's in a

wheelchair.

SAYER O.S.

Yes.

LEONARD

Am I speaking?

SAYER O.S.

Yes.

Leonard's eyes drift to a chair, his mother's chair, the one

she has used for thirty years. It's empty.

SAYER O.S.

Your mother is well. She's home.

She visits you on Sundays.

Leonard slowly nods.    Somehow he knows that.

LEONARD                :

SAYER O.S.                     ,

She's trying to.

Leonard's eyes drift again, across to silent ghost-like figures

in wheelchairs, the post-encephalitics, all of them, "asleep"

again.

SAYER O.S.

They fought, as you did, with

great courage. They were strong.

Leonard looks down at his hands and feels one with the other.

He looks back at the "sleeping" patients, not comprehending why

they cannot do the same.

LEONARD

I'm stronger?

Sayer is finally revealed seated beside him. He doesn't

answer. Leonard's hands slowly reach to his face and feel its

features.

LEONARD

,x             I'm here, aren't I?

His glance finds the tray beside Sayer, the paper medicine cup

and empty juice cup on it. He must be back on the medication

again. He looks back to Sayer, who's looking toward the

window, to the falling snow. Eventually -

SAYER

Do you think you can walk?

203.   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY                                          203

A doctor in a lab coat, one Sayer long ago imparted his "will

of the ball" theory to, emerges from a ward.

FERNANDO O.S.

Dr. Tyler?

The doctor turns.    Fernando is walking toward him.

FERNANDO

You got a minute?

DR. TYLER

What is it?

FERNANDO

Sayer and Leonard approach. Margaret has positioned herself,

like Anthony, against the wall, and, pointing out something on

a clipboard to Dr. Sullivan, glances up briefly as Sayer and

T~^\

Sayer and Leonard approaching the lobby. As they enter, the

switchboard operator glances up, notices them, and glances back

down without a word.

They approach the front doors.      They are almost there.   From

behind them, loudly --

MISS COSTELLO O.S.

Dr. Kaufman?

KAUFMAN O.S.

Dr. Sayer?

Sayer and Leonard stop just short of the doors. They glance

back and see- Kaufman -and,v-several* steps .behind..him, looking

distraught, Miss Costello. She has failed.

SAYER

Yes?

The two doctors stare at one another for several moments.

Clearly Kaufman knows what is happening. Clearly Sayer knows

he knows. Eventually --

KAUFMAN               ,

Put a coat on him for Christ's

sake.

He turns around, walks past Miss Costello and down the corridor-

from which he came. Miss Costello relaxes, turns around and

walks away down the corridor.

Sayer and Leonard turn and walk outside.

206.    INT. DAYROOM - SAME TIME - DAY                                 206.

Though Rolando is not playing, cannot play, the piano, he can

hear it, distant, like an echo, as a nurse wheels him toward

the windows. Other nurses and orderlies are wheeling Rose,

Frank, Bert, and Lucy and the others there. Sidney is wheeling

Lolly.

They all "peer" out. They all "see" down below, standing

across the street, Sayer and Leonard.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)       Pg.115

Neither quite knows what to say. Eventually, Sayer holds out a

hand for Leonard to shake. Leonard stares at it for a long

moment, then awkwardly embraces Sayer.

208.   INT. DAYROOM - SAME TIME - DAY                              208

The others "watch" Sayer cross back to the hospital. They

"watch" Leonard staring after him. He glances down the street,

Leonard, glances down the street the other way. He seems

uncertain which way to go . . .

He walks away.

209.   INT. SUBWAY - EVENING                                       209

Rhythmic pounding.   Metal wheels over metal tracks.

Leonard feels things.inside his coat pockets. He,pulls from

one several capsules of L-Dopa in a clear plastic bag; and from

the other, a wad of money wrapped in paper on which is typed

his name and "Bainbridge Hospital, Bronx." He stuffs it

all back into his pocket and glances up. :

The train is crowded. Everyone seems to be hiding behind a

newspaper or the veil of a glazed look; everyone but Leonard

and the eleven year old boy seated next to him with his mother.

They're taking everything in, Leonard and1 the boy - the rumbl

of the train, the overhead lights flashing off and on again,

the mounting excitement they both feel.

The boy glances up at Leonard, and, like a secret -

BOY ON TRAIN

We're going to the city.

Underground tunnels. People climbing stairs. Leonard climbing

Through an exit turnstile. Up more stairs. And finally -

Leonard, emerging from down below, reaches the street. People

jostle past him but he doesn't move. He stares in wonder at

what lies before him . . . lights, skyscrapers, Christmas

decorations, taxis, noise, people . . . life.

211A.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT                211A.

An oppressive silence. The oppressive institutional room.

Sayer, alone in it, at his desk in the corner.

MISS COSTELLO O.S.

Good night.

Sayer glances up, sees Miss Costello in the doorway to the

corridor.

SAYER

Good night.

i

She leaves. He-stays. iPuts.a -folder in.a.drawer* Straightens

things on the desk. Looks for something more to do. Clearly

there's nothing more to do.

He gets up. Wanders slowly around the room. Past the medical

instruments in the glass cases, the tripod and projector, along

tne waii covered with taped and tacked data, notes, Polaroids.

Buried in it he sees Leonard's original perception test, and

alongside it, the first Polaroid of him . . .

Sayer abruptly moves to the window, yanks at it, but it's

jammed shut again. Below he can see Miss Costello crossing

toward her car. He fights with the window, finally frees it,

slides it open and yells out loudly -

SAYER

Eleanor.

She turns to the voice. He turns from the window.

Tight on the glasses left on his desk.

211B.   EXT. PARKING LOT, BAINBRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT    211B.

He hurries out of the building and across the lot. Winded, he

A mechanical dog crosses Leonard's path wagging its tail.

Unlike everyone else, he stops to admire it. He's enchanted by

it. He smiles at the peddler and the "litter of pups" moving

around his feet.

220.   INT. TAXI - NIGHT                                          220.

The cab rattling down another street.

LEONARD

You have children, Hector?

Hector takes a photograph from his chauffeur's permit plate and

hands it back. A boy, five, healthy and happy.

LEONARD

He's lovely.

HECTOR

I thank God for him every day.

Every single day.

Leonard begins to weep softly. Once Hector notices, he slows

the car, pulls to the curb, and studies Leonard in the rear

view mirror. Has this man lost a child? The taxi engine

idles.                                     :

221.   EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT                                 221.

The cab, empty, parked in front of an apartment building in a

working class neighborhood.

222.   INT. HECTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                             222

The mechanical dog on a bathroom sink. Leonard staring at his

reflection in a mirror. And at his hands. It's happening.

He's falling apart.

HALLWAY. Leonard at a bedroom door. Peering in at Hector's

sleeping son. He steps quietly into the room and places the

mechanical dog on the pillow beside the boy's head.

THE LIVING ROOM. A small Christmas tree. Hector and his wife

sitting on cheap furniture with cups of egg nog. Leonard

emerges from the hallway.

LEONARD

I have to be leaving.

(having trouble with

the words)

I want to th-ank you. You've been

very kind to me.

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)               Pg.121

HECTOR

Leave? You're our guest, we got

dinner coming. We're having

something to eat.

HECTOR

Stay with us.

LEONARD

I can't.

HECTOR

Hey -

LEONARD

It has no value to me, believe    ;

me.

HECTOR

I don't want it.

LEONARD

It's for your son. It's for him.

HECTOR

At least let me give you a lift

wherever you're going.

LEONARD

No, I think I ' d like to walk.       .

(to Hector's wife)

Thank you.

HECTOR

What's wrong with you, Len?

REV.12/15/89 (GREEN)    Pg.122

(pause)

This is good, what you've got

here.

HECTOR

I know that.

LEONARD

Bye.

SAYER O.S.

Leonard?

glances up at him. Behind them, in the distance, Hector stands

outside his parked cab. Sayer sits. Long silence . . .

I' m sorry.

LEONARD

What for?

He smiles crookedly, then looks out across the water again.

LEONARD

Isn't that something . . .

Sayer looks out. The morning colors are mirroring off the

water like paint on glass. They both watch. The colors are

deepening right before their eyes. Long, long silence

before . . .

LEONARD

Can you take me home?

Sayer helps him up. And as they move slowly toward the waiting

taxi. Hector opens the rear door. The only sound is the hiss

of tires, the -rhythm of wheels, .until -

LEONARD V.O.

When I was a boy I felt myself

being carried away by illness like

a swimmer sucked out by the tide.

Drifting slowly out across the water and the Brooklyn Bridge

stretching out across it.

LEONARD V.O.

I feel it again, only this time

I've been somewhere. I vent to a

J

place and felt things I never

dreamed of. I went to a place and

felt hope and fear and hatred and

love, I glimpsed life . . .

225.   INT. LEONARD'S LIBRARY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                    225.

Drifting slowly across the faces of patients reading in

Leonard's library, and settling finally tight on him, "asleep."

LEONARD V.O.

It's good, life.

Spines of books on shelves lining the walls. And Paula's face,

considering the titles.

She pulls one of the books down at random and crosses the     ,

library with Sayer, passing patients - including the woman with

multiple sclerosis - readiny at tables with flowers on them.

SAYER O.S.

Leonard?

He's in a wheelchair, behind an oak desk on which rests, among

other things, the Ouija board. His eyes open but do not appear

to comprehend the doctor's presence or his surroundings. His

expression is absolutely "expressionless."

SAYER

I ' m sorry to wake you, but there's

someone here to see you.

Leonard remains still. "Asleep." And there's a long silence

broken only by the sound of pages being turned. And then, from

Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" --

PAULA

(reading)

"Night is generally my time for

walking. In the summer, I often

leave home early in the morning

and roam about fields and lanes.:

' "^             all day. Or even escape for

days or weeks together . . .

Leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes

the words or her voice . . . but he does. And as she reads,

the words become alive and the walls recede ...

PAULA

"But saving in the country, I

seldom go out until after dark,

though Heaven be thanked, I love

its light and feel the

cheerfulness it sheds upon the

earth as much as any creature

living . . . "

And he is moving into the light.
