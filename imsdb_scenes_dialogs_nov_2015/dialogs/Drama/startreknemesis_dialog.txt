STAR TREK: NEMESIS

by

John Logan

SENATOR 1

... but if we hesitate we'll lose

this important source of dilithium.

A trade agreement is in the best

interests of the Empire.

SENATOR 2

Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a

diplomatic mission to Celes II to

open negotiations.

PRAETOR

Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with

the motion.

TAL'AURA

No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"

is to be advised.  I support all

"diplomatic" overtures.  But if you

will excuse me, Praetor, I have an

appointment with the Tholian

ambassador.

PRAETOR

Then I will call for a vote on the

motion to open trade negotiations

with Celes II...

PRAETOR

Would someone please tell me what

that was?

(he turns to a guard)

Alert security --

PRAETOR

-- and have them run a --

PICARD

Duty...

PICARD

A starship captain's life is filled

with solemn duty.  I have commanded

men in battle.  I have negotiated

peace treaties between implacable

enemies.  I have represented the

Federation in first contact with

twenty-seven alien species.  But

none of this compares to my solemn

duty as... Best man.

PICARD

Now, I know that on an occasion

such as this: it is expected that I

be gracious and fulsome with praise

on the wonders of this blessed

union... But have you two

considered what you're doing to?

This is all a damned

inconvenience...

(laughter from the crowd)

While you're happily settling in on

the Titan, I'll have to train a new

first officer; no doubt a stern

martinet who'll quote the rule book

at me and never... ever... allow me

to go on away missions.

(laughter)

... Then there's the matter of my

new counselor.  Undoubtedly some

soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll

be probing into my darkest psyche

as she nods her head and coos

sympathetically.  Isn't that right,

Deanna?

PICARD

I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along

with the rest of you.  As most of

you know, the doctor will also soon

be leaving the Enterprise, to

assume command of Starfleet

Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,

Beverly, have you considered what

you're doing to little ole' me?!

I'll probably get some old battle-

axe of a doctor who'll tell me to

eat my vegetables and put me on

report if I don't show up for my

physical on time!

BEVERLY

It'll serve you right.

PICARD

Really, it's not too late to

reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

PICARD

Will Riker, you have been my

trusted right arm for fourteen

years; you have helped keep my

course true and steady.  Deanna

Troi, you have been my conscience

and best guide, the touchstone to

the better parts of myself.  You

are my family.  And in proper

maritime tradition I wish you full

sails and a clear horizon... My

friends, make it so.

BEVERLY

(playfully)

Sort of like losing a son and

gaining an empath, isn't it?

PICARD

Please, Beverly, this is hard

enough.

BEVERLY

If you start tearing up I promise

to beam you out.  Level one medical

emergency.  There's no crying in

Starfleet.

LEAH

I've never seen your Captain so

nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft

in his old age.

GEORDI

(laughs)

Not likely.  After we installed the

new Series Four replicators, he

tried to order his usual tea and

there was a glitch.  Had us remove

the whole bunch of them and put the

old ones back in.

LEAH

There!  Nostalgic about old

replicators.

GEORDI

He just likes things the way he

likes them...

(he looks at her, smiles)

Of course, so do I.

WORF

Romulan ale should be illegal.

GEORDI

It is, old chum.

WORF

Then it should be more illegal.

DEANNA

Really, Captain, it was a lovely

toast.

PICARD

The least I could do for you,

Deanna.  Besides, you know me...

I'm a talking head.

DEANNA

And you needn't worry.  I'll brief

your new counselor on everything

she needs to know.

PICARD

The hell you will.  You know too

much about me as it is... Now you

promised there are no speeches

during the ceremony on Betazed.

RIKER

No, no speeches.  No clothes

either.

(winks, mischievously)

DATA

Ladies and Gentlemen and invited

Tran gendered species... In my

study of Terran and Betazoid

conjugal rites I have discovered it

is traditional to present the

"happy couple" with a gift.  Given

Commander Riker's affection for

archaic musical forms I have

elected to present the following as

my gift in honor of their

conjugation.

DATA

If you please, Mister Band Leader,

a-one and a-two and...

DATA

(sings)

"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing

but blue skies do I see.  Blue

birds, singing a song, Nothing but

blue birds all day long.  Never saw

the sun shining so bright, Never

saw things going so right..."

WORF

(groans)

Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

DEANNA

(smiles)

All right, go ahead.

PICARD

(to Deanna)

May I have this dance?

DEANNA

With pleasure, Captain.

BEVERLY

Commander Worf... Do Klingons

swing?

WORF

I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

BEVERLY

Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

BEVERLY

I'm so glad you made it back to the

Enterprise before I left.

WORF

I was not suited for the life of

a... diplomat.

BEVERLY

(wry)

Who'd have guessed?

PICARD

I've been saving this.  Chateau

Picard 2267.  Batten down the

hatches...

PICARD

They say a vintner's history is in

every glass.  The soil he came

from.  His past as well as his

hopes for the future.

PICARD

So... To happy endings.

DATA

To happy endings.

DATA

Sir.  I noticed an interesting

confluence of emotion at the

wedding.  I am familiar with the

human concept of tears through

laughter and its inverse, laughter

through tears, but I could not help

wondering about the human capacity

for expressing both pleasure and

sadness simultaneously.

PICARD

I understand why it would seem

confusing.  Certain human rituals --

like weddings, birthdays or

funerals evoke strong and very

complex emotions.  These rites

carry great weight with us because

they denote the passage of time.

DATA

And you were particularly aware of

this feeling because Commander

Riker will be leaving to assume

command of the Titan?

PICARD

Will and Deanna joining the Titan.

Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet

Medical...

DATA

And this makes you "sad"?

PICARD

Well.  I suppose it does a bit.

I'm very happy for them, of course,

but I'm going to miss them.  The

ship will seem... incomplete

without them.

DATA

That is because you have a

familiarity with them.  You can

predict specific reactions and

behavior and are comfortable in

that knowledge.

PICARD

Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as

well.  They've made important

choices; they're going to have

great challenges ahead of them.

New worlds to conquer...

PICARD

Seeing Will and Deanna today made

me think about some of the choices

I've made in my own life.  Devoting

myself to Starfleet... Not marrying

or having children... All the

choices that led me here.

DATA

The choices I made have led me here

as well.  This is the only home I

have ever known.  I cannot foresee

a reason for leaving.

PICARD

You never know what's over the

horizon, Data.  Before too long

you'll be offered a command of your

own.  Data looks at him; he has

never really considered this.

DATA

If I were... I believe my memory

engrams would sense the absence of

your specific reactions and

behavior.  I would "miss you."

PICARD

(smiles)

Now, you make a toast.

DATA

To new worlds...

PICARD

New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new

worlds...

SURAN

The fleet commanders are nervous.

They've agreed to remain at their

given coordinates and await his

orders.  But they're anxious to

know what's going on here.

DONATRA

I don't blame them.  We can't keep

them in the dark forever.

VICEROY (V.O.)

But in darkness, there is strength.

VICEROY

Don't you agree?

SHINZON (V.O.)

Consider it  The great symbol of

the Empire... But the bird-of-prey

holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.

Their destinies conjoined...

SHINZON

Yet for generations one of those

planets has been without a voice.

We will be silent no longer.

SHINZON

Join us, Commanders.  Now what's

the disposition of the fleet?

SURAN

They're holding position.

SHINZON

And?

SURAN

(bows his head)

They will obey, Praetor.

SHINZON

It's imperative we retain their

allegiance or our great mission

will be strangled before it can

truly draw breath.

DONATRA

They support your intentions, sir.

But they require evidence of

your... sincerity.

SHINZON

And they'll have it.

(he begins to pace over

the star chart)

Tell the fleet that the days of

negotiation and diplomacy are over.

The Almighty Federation will fall

before us.  As I promised you.

SHINZON

The time we have dreamed of is at

hand.  The time... of conquest.

(sinister laugh)

SHINZON

Cut off the dragon's head and it

cannot strike back.

SURAN

How many Warbirds will you need?

SHINZON

None.

SURAN

Praetor.  You have the whole fleet

at your disposal.  They supported

the coup, they'll follow you.

SHINZON

The Scimitar will serve my needs.

SURAN

But surely --

SHINZON

I came this far alone...

(he looks at his Reman

warriors)

We came this far alone.  We require

no assistance from the fleet.  Now

leave me to my thoughts.

SHINZON

Are we prepared?

VICEROY

Yes, Praetor.

SHINZON

So many years for this moment.

(he looks up at his

Viceroy, smiles)

Bring him to me.

WORF

(grumbles)

I won't do it.

DEANNA

It's tradition,Worf.  You of all

people should appreciate that!

(whispers)

Besides, I've already seen it.

WORF

A warrior does not appear without

his clothing.  It leaves him...

vulnerable.

RIKER

I don't think we're going to see

much combat on Betazed.

DEANNA

Don't be too sure.  Mother will be

there.

WORF

I won't do it.

PICARD

Won't do what, Mister Worf?

WORF

Captain.  I think it is

inappropriate for a Starfleet

officer to appear...

(hates the word)

... naked.

PICARD

Come now, a big, strapping fellow

like you?  What are you afraid of?

WORF

I'm picking up an unusual

electromagnetic signature from the

Kolarin system.

PICARD

What sort of signature?

WORF

Positronic.

GEORDI

It's very faint but I've isolated

it to the third planet in the

Kolarin system.

PICARD

What do we know about the planet?

GEORDI

Uncharted.  We'll have to get

closer for a more detailed scan.

PICARD

(to Data)

Theories?

DATA

Since positronic signatures have

only been known to emanate from

androids such as myself, it is

logical to theorize that there is

an android such as myself on

Kolarus III.

GEORDI

How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

DATA

I thought only me, myself and Lore.

RIKER

(looking at star chart)

Diverting to the Kolarin system

takes us awfully close to the

Romulan Neutral Zone.

PICARD

(looking at star chart)

Still well on our side...

PICARD

I think it's worth a look.  Don't

worry, Number One, we'll get you to

Betazed with time to spare.

RIKER

Thank you, sir...

PICARD

(to all, especially Worf)

Where we will all honor the

Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,

or any other parts of our anatomy.

Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be

in the gym.

RIKER

(to Helm Officer)

Mister Branson, set course for the

Kolarin system.  Warp Five --

(Deanna shoots him a

glance)

-- Warp Seven.

HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)

Plotted and laid in, sir.

RIKER

Engage.

DEANNA

You better believe you're engaged!

GEORDI

What do you think, Data, a long-

lost relative?

GEORDI

I read six distinct positronic

signatures, spread out over a few

kilometers on the surface.

PICARD

What do we know about the

population?

DATA

Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It

appears to be a pre-warp

civilization at an early stage of

industrial development.

GEORDI

Captain, I don't recommend

transporting, that ion storm

doesn't look very neighborly.  It

could head this way without much

warning.

PICARD

Understood.  Data, Worf, you're

with me.

RIKER

(stands, protesting)

Captain, I hope I don't have to

remind you --

PICARD

I appreciate your concern, Number

One, but I've been itching to try

out the Argo.

RIKER

Sir --

PICARD

Captain's prerogative, Will.

There's no foreseeable danger...

and your wife would never forgive

me if anything happened to you.

PICARD

You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

DATA

The closest signature is two

kilometers to the west... that

direction, sir.

PICARD

Thank you, Data.

(he smiles)

Let's see what she can do.

DATA

I will always be baffled by the

human predilection for piloting

vehicles at unsafe velocities.

DATA

(monitoring with

tricorder)

Over that rise, sir... half a

kilometer.

DATA

It appears to be...

(he scans with his

tricorder)

... an arm.

WORF

(suspicious)

Why is it moving?

DATA

Like me, it has been designed with

modular power sources.

PICARD

Mister Worf, if you please.

DATA

The next signature is one kilometer

to the south.

DATA

The final signature is

approximately 300 meters up that

incline.

PICARD

Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

WORF

(uneasy)

To find the head, sir?

PICARD

(amused)

If you don't mind.

DATA

Ten meters...

DATA

I think it unlikely you will need

your phaser to recover the cranial

unit.  Of course, it could bite

you.

WORF

It's you.

DATA

The resemblance is... striking.

HEAD

Why am I looking at me?

DATA

You are not looking at yourself.

You are looking at me.

HEAD

(looking at Worf)

You do not look like me.

WORF

No.

DATA

(to head)

I would like to pick you up now.

May I do that?

HEAD

(to Worf)

You have a pretty shirt.

WORF

Thank you.

DATA

Fascinating...

HEAD

I have two arms and ten fingers.

Do you know where my arms are?  I

cannot see where we are going.

Where are we going?

(Etc... like Threepio in

"Empire" when he's

strapped to Chewbacca's

back.)

DATA

Commander!

WORF

STOP TALKING!

WORF

If you wouldn't mind.

DATA

Thank you.

HEAD

You have a shiny head.

DATA

He is very observant.

PICARD

I can see that.

WORF

Captain!

PICARD

(to Data)

Shall we try some "unsafe

velocities?"

HEAD

(to Picard)

You have a red shirt.

DATA

(to head)

This is not an appropriate time for

a conversation.

HEAD

Why?

DATA

Because the captain has to

concentrate on piloting the

vehicle.

HEAD

Why?

PICARD

Data!

DATA

Sorry, sir.

PICARD

Mister Data.  Let's make like the

wind.

WORF

(smiles)

He must have Klingon blood.

BEVERLY

I think you have nicer eyes.

DATA

Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

RIKER

Geordi?

GEORDI

(at work analyzing the

torso section)

Well, he seems to have the same

internal mechanics as Data but not

as much positronic development.

The neural pathways aren't nearly

as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a

prototype.  Something Dr. Soong

created before Data.

DATA

(to head)

Do you have a name, sir?

HEAD

I am the B-9.

PICARD

Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for

whimsical names seems to have no

end.

HEAD

(to Riker)

You have a fuzzy face.

PICARD

(trying to ignore the

head)

Keep me informed, Number One, and,

please, put him back together.

DATA

Can you tell me how you came to be

on the planet where we found you?

B-9

(blandly)

I was taken from my homeworld by

people called the "PakJeds." They

are fat.  They traded me to a ship

belonging to the "Bolians." The

"Bolians" are blue.  They put me in

a seat and asked me questions.

Then they were attacked by another

ship...

B-9

Then people called the

Delviciansans picked me up.  They

have long teeth.  They asked if I

do anything to help them.  I told

them I could do whatever they

wanted.  They asked me to clean out

the matrix manifolds.  I told them

I did not know what an Matrix

manifold looks like.

BEVERLY

Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics

to run on some medical scanner

things.

B-9

And after they showed me the

"engine manifolds." Then they

showed me something called a

"plasma mop"

B-9

... then the "Cardassians" put me

into something called a "garbage

chute" and I went out into space

again --

WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)

Worf to Commander Riker.  I have

the tactical manifests ready, sir.

RIKER

(quickly tapping his comm

badge)

Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right

there!...

(he stands)

Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

B-9

Fuzzy face is gone.

DATA

Yes, please continue.

B-9

I was in space for a long time.

Then a ship belonging to the

"Talosians" picked me up.  They

asked me where I came from.  I told

them people called the "Pakleds"

took me from my homeworld.  They

are fat...

B-9

Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

DATA

Do you know who I am?

B-9

You are me.

DATA

No.  My name is Data... I am your

brother.

DEANNA

(to Worf)

... and after the ceremony on

Betazed, three entire weeks for our

honeymoon.

RIKER

We're going sailing on the Opal

Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned

solar catamaran.  Just us and the

sun and the waves.

WORF

It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

DEANNA

(amused)

It's meant to be relaxing.

WORF

A Klingon honeymoon begins with the

Kholamar desert march where the

couple bonds in endurance trials.

If they survive the challenge they

move on to the Fire Caves of

Fek'lhr to face the demons of

Gre'thor.

RIKER

Well, that sounds relaxing too.

WORF

It is... invigorating.

RIKER

So they've got him up and running.

WORF

He's a very unusual android

RIKER

(smiles)

Runs in the family.

PICARD

Earl Grey, hot.

PICARD

Come.

(Deanna enters)

Counselor.

DEANNA

Do you have a moment, sir?

PICARD

Of course, sit down.

DEANNA

It's about Data  I've watched him

with the B-9 and I'm troubled.

Data's desire for a "family" is

very strong.  I'm afraid he may be

investing too much in the B-9.

PICARD

You're speaking of emotional

investment?

DEANNA

The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.

And Data, in his own way, has

assumed the position of a parent or

guardian.  I'm afraid he has

expectations based on his own

experiences.  He'll be disappointed

when the B-9 cannot meet those

expectations.

PICARD

As much as we care for him,

Deanna... we have to remember that

Data isn't capable of

disappointment.

DEANNA

I don't believe that, sir.  We've

shared many disappointing journeys.

PICARD

I'm going to miss you.

DEANNA

And I you.

RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)

Captain, you have an Alpha Priority

communication from Starfleet

Command.

PICARD

Acknowledged...

(Deanna stands)

... I'll talk to Data

DEANNA

Thank you, sir.

PICARD

Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip

to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

PICARD

(smiles)

With or without the rest of the

fleet?

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

A diplomatic mission.  We've been

invited, believe it or not.  Seems

there's been some kind of internal

political shakeup.  The new

Praetor, someone called Shinzon,

has requested a Federation envoy.

PICARD

New Praetor?

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

There's more... as always.  He's

Reman.

(Picard is surprised)

Believe me, we don't understand it

either.  You're the closest ship so

I want you to high tail it over

there and hear what he has to say.

Get the lay of the land, If the

Empire becomes unstable, it could

mean trouble for the entire

quadrant.

PICARD

Understood.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)

We're sending you all the

intelligence we have, but it's not

much.  I don't need to tell you to

watch your back, Jean Luc.

PICARD

Not with the Romulans.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

(smiles wryly)

The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,

the evil Soran and that pesky

Nexus.  You seem to get all the

easy assignments!

PICARD

Just lucky, Admiral.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Let's hope that luck holds.

Janeway out.

PICARD

(to Helm)

Lay in a new course... Take us to

Romulus.  Warp eight.

HELM OFFICER

Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and

laid in...

RIKER

Romulus?

PICARD

I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have

to wait, Number One... Engage.

DATA

As you can see the habitable half

of Remus is always in darkness

because, like Mercury, one side

always faces the sun.  Due to the

extreme temperatures on that half

of their world, the Remans live on

the dark side of the planet.

DATA

Almost nothing is known about the

Reman homeworld, although

intelligence scans have proven the

existence of dilithium mining and

heavy weapons construction.

DATA

The Remans themselves are

considered an undesirable caste in

the hierarchy of the Empire.

RIKER

But they also have the reputation

of being formidable warriors.  In

the Dominion War, Reman forces were

used as assault troops in the most

violent encounters.

PICARD

(grim)

Cannon fodder.

GEORDI

Then how did a Reman get to be

Praetor?  I don't get it.

RIKER

We have to assume he had Romulan

collaborators.

PICARD

A coup d'etat?

RIKER

The Praetor's power has always been

the Romulan fleet.  They must be

behind him.

PICARD

(to Data)

What have you learned about

Shinzon?

DATA

Starfleet intelligence was only

able to provide a partial account

of his military record.  We can

infer he is relatively young and a

capable commander.  He fought

seventeen major engagements in the

war.  All successful.  Beyond that,

we know nothing.

PICARD

Well... it seems we're truly

sailing into the unknown.  Keep at

it.  Anything you can give me would

be appreciated.  Dismissed.

DATA

At present he serves no useful

function.  Dr. Soong created us to

become active and useful members of

society.  I do not believe he would

have wanted the B-9 to live out his

life in his present state.

GEORDI

I can't believe the Captain went

along with a memory download.

DATA

Captain Picard agrees that the B-9

was probably designed with the same

self-actualization parameters as

myself.  If my memory engrams are

successfully integrated into his

positronic matrix, he should have

all my abilities.

GEORDI

He'd have all your memories too.

You feel comfortable with that?

DATA

I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my

belief that with my memory engrams

he will be able to function as a

more complete individual.

GEORDI

An individual more like you, you

mean.

DATA

Yes.

GEORDI

Maybe he's not supposed to be like

you.  Maybe he's supposed to be

just like he is.

GEORDI

Okay... we're done.

DATA

(to B-9)

Do you know where you are?

B-9

I am in a room with lights.

DATA

Can you remember our father?

B-9

No.

DATA

Do you know the name of the Captain

of this vessel?

B-9

No.

DATA

Is that your final answer?

GEORDI

(to B-9)

Do you know my name?

B-9

You have a soft voice.

GEORDI

(gently)

Data, he's assimilating a lot of

programming.  Remember, he's a

prototype, a lot less sophisticated

than you are.  We just don't know

if his matrix will be able to

adapt.  Or if he'll be able to

retain anything.  We should give

him some time.

DATA

What purpose does this serve?

GEORDI

(also examining circuitry)

It seems to be a redundant memory

port.  Maybe it's for provisional

memory storage in case his neural

pathways overload?

DATA

Dr. Soong must have found it

unnecessary in later versions.

GEORDI

It's possible the extra memory port

is interfering with the engram

processing.  Mind if I keep him

here and run some diagnostics?

DATA

No, I do not mind.

DATA

But I believe he will prove

incapable of performing higher

functions.

GEORDI

Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,

I know, you're not capable of hope.

DATA

(looking at B-9)

I am not.

DATA

No, remain with Commander La Forge.

He is going to try to make you

well.

PICARD (V.O.)

Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.

The Enterprise has arrived at

Romulus and is waiting at the

designated coordinates.  All our

hails have gone unanswered.  We've

been waiting for seventeen hours.

RIKER

Why don't they answer our hails?

PICARD

It's an old psychological strategy,

Number One.  To put him in a

position of dominance and make us

uneasy.

RIKER

It's working.

PICARD

(to Deanna)

Counselor?

DEANNA

They're out there, sir.

WORF

Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

PICARD

Not yet, Mister Worf.

RIKER

Captain, with all due respect to

diplomatic protocols -- the

Federation Council's not sitting

out here, we are.

PICARD

Patience.  Diplomacy is a very

exacting occupation.  We can wait.

DATA

Captain...

RIKER

(slowly rising from his

chair)

My God...

WORF

(tense)

Should I raise shields?

PICARD

No!

WORF

Captain -- !

PICARD

(firm)

Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

WORF

(quickly analyzing

tactical display)

Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-

seven photon torpedo bays, primary

and secondary phased shields.

RIKER

She's not out for a pleasure

cruise.

PICARD

(grim)

She's a predator.

WORF

We're being hailed.

PICARD

On screen.

VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Enterprise.  We are the Reman

Warbird Scimitar.

PICARD

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

I am not Shinzon.  I am his

Viceroy.  We are sending transport

coordinates.

RIKER

Not very chatty.

PICARD

Away team.  Transporter room four.

SHINZON (V.O.)

I hope you'll forgive the

darkness... we're not comfortable

in the light.

PICARD

Praetor Shinzon?

SHINZON

Captain Picard... Jean Luc

Picard... I don't mean to stare,

it's just -- well, you can't

imagine how long I've been waiting

for this moment.  I always imagined

you taller, isn't that odd?

(to Data)

You may scan me without subterfuge,

Commander Data.

PICARD

And you're not as we imagined you.

SHINZON

No?

WORF

You are human.

SHINZON

Commander Worf.

(he speaks in Klingon)

I greet you as a valiant warrior...

and as my brother.

WORF

(terse, in Klingon)

I'll save my greetings for a better

brother.

PICARD

Why have you asked for our presence

here?

PICARD

Praetor?

SHINZON

(quietly)

I've never met a human woman.

DEANNA

I'm only half human.

SHINZON

Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic

and telepathic abilities, ship's

counselor.  All of this I knew...

But I didn't know you were so

beautiful.

RIKER

You seem very familiar with our

personnel.

SHINZON

I am, Commander Riker...

(to Deanna)

... May I touch your hair?

PICARD

(firm)

Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a

matter we were -- assured was of

great importance.  If you have

anything to say to us as

representatives of the Federation,

I suggest you do so now.

SHINZON

(softly)

On the world I come from there's no

light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't

important.  I see now there's a

world elsewhere.

PICARD

Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to

discuss your lack of a social life.

SHINZON

(turning back to Picard)

Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.

(he smiles)

There's so much we have to talk

about.

PICARD

I would be interested to know what

we are talking about.

SHINZON

Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the

walls between us to recognize we

are one people.  Federation and

Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and

Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of

the thing that makes us the same.

We want peace.

SHINZON

I want to end the centuries of

mistrust.  I want to be your ally,

not your enemy.  As a first step I

propose we eliminate the Neutral

Zone and begin a free and open

exchange of goods and ideas.

PICARD

And the Senate supports you?

SHINZON

(dry)

I have dissolved the Senate.

SHINZON

Right now, you're thinking this all

sounds too good to be true?

PICARD

Yes.

SHINZON

And you're wondering why the

Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this

the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a

predator?

(Picard is startled at

Shinzon's choice of

words)

... But you're also thinking the

chance for peace is too promising

to ignore.  Above all, you're

trying to decide if you can trust

me.

PICARD

Yes.

SHINZON

Then perhaps the time has come to

add some illumination to our

discussion.  Computer, raise

lighting four levels.

SHINZON

Allow me to tell you a story that I

hope will clarify my position.

When I was very young I was

stricken with an odd disease.  I

developed a hyper-sensitivity to

sound.  The slightest whisper

caused me agony...

SHINZON

No one knew what to do.  Finally I

was taken to a doctor who had some

experience with Terran illnesses

and I was finally diagnosed with

Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of

it, Captain?

PICARD

You know I do.

SHINZON

Then you know it's a very rare

syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male

members of my family had it.

Eventually I was treated.  Now I

can hear as well as you can,

Captain.

SHINZON

I can see as well as you can.  I

can feel everything you feel.

(He stops right before

Picard)

In fact, I feel exactly what you

feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

SHINZON

Do you trust me now?

PICARD

We need to talk, just you and I.

SHINZON

Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.

Just the two of us.  Or just the

one of us.

PICARD

You know I need to verify this.

SHINZON

I know.

SHINZON

Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so

much to discuss.

PICARD

Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam

out.

BEVERLY

There's no doubt, Captain.  Right

down to your regressive strain of

Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

PICARD

When was he... created?

BEVERLY

About twenty-five years ago.  They

probably used a hair follicle or

skin cell.

PICARD

(touching head)

I think a skin cell's the more

likely of the two.

RIKER

Why?

PICARD

Believe me, Number One; I'm going

to find out.  Contact Starfleet

Command and inform them of the

situation.  I need to know where

the hell he came from.  Deanna.

DEANNA

I would say he's been trained to

resist telepathy.  What I could

sense of his emotions were erratic,

very hard to follow.

PICARD

Is he sincere about wanting peace?

DEANNA

I don't know.

(she stops him)

Sir, the strongest sense I had was

that he's more than curious about

you.  He very much wants to know

you.

(she looks at him deeply)

The same way you want to know him.

PICARD

How could I not?

DEANNA

Captain, don't assume he's anything

like you are.  You should resist

the urge to think you know him.

PICARD

I not only know him, Deanna, I am

him... and he is me!

DEANNA

Will, you need to rest.

(he continues to work)

As ship's counselor, I'm

recommending you get me sleep.

RIKER

Some honeymoon.

DEANNA

We have time.

(she kisses him)

Come to bed.

RIKER

Imzadi, what am I going to do with

you?

SHINZON

Imzadi.  This is so good.

DEANNA

No!

SHINZON

He can never know you as I know

you... He can never touch you as I

touch you.

DEANNA

This isn't real.

SHINZON

Can you feel my hands... are they

real?  Can you feel my lips, my

loins?

SHINZON (V.O.)

I'm with you, Imzadi...

SHINZON

I'll always be with you now.  Now

and forever...

DEANNA

You sick bastard!

RIKER

Deanna?!  What's with the name

calling?

SURAN

... then I don't understand the

reason for the delay!

SHINZON

You don't have to understand.

SURAN

And bringing the Enterprise here?!

What possible purpose could that

serve?!

SHINZON

I have a purpose.

SURAN

Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

SHINZON

(snaps)

Silence, Romulan!

SHINZON

You must learn patience, Commander.

Do you know where I learned it?  In

the dilithium mines of Remus.

Spend eighteen hours every day

under the lash of a Romulan guard's

whip and you'll soon understand

patience.

SURAN

(carefully bows his head)

Praetor.

SHINZON

Now go.  I have some personal

business.

DONATRA

How long before he has us in the

dilithium mines?

SHINZON

And when I was ready they were

going to replace you with me, an

exact biological duplicate.  Put a

Romulan agent at the heart of

Starfleet to influence your command

structure.  It was a bold plan.

PICARD

What happened?

SHINZON

As happens so frequently here on

Romulus, a new government came to

power.  They decided to abandon the

plan -- frankly, I think they were

afraid I'd be discovered and it

would lead to war.  They weren't

ready for that.

SHINZON

Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I

can't stand it.

PICARD

(smiles)

You'll acquire a taste for it.

SHINZON

It's not quite the face you

remember.

PICARD

Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

SHINZON

A lifetime of violence will do

that.  My nose was broken four

times.  And my jaw... But so much

is the same.  The eyes, you

recognize the eyes.

PICARD

Yes.  The eyes have it.

SHINZON

Our eyes reflect our lives, don't

they?  Yours are so confident.

PICARD

How did you end up on Remus?

SHINZON

They sent me there to die.  How

could a mere human survive the

dilithium mines?  It was...

(he can't find the words)

... I was a slave.  And a monster.

The only thing the Romulan guards

hated more than the Remans was me.

But one man took pity on me: the

man who became my Viceroy.  He

taught me how to survive.  And in

that dark place, where there was

nothing of myself, I found my Reman

brothers.  They showed me the only

kindness I ever knew.

SHINZON

For thousands of years the Romulan

Senate has met in this chamber and

dictated the fate of its sister-

planet... But the time has come for

us to live as equals.

PICARD

You're doing this to liberate the

Remans?

SHINZON

No race should be a slave to

another.

SHINZON

You don't trust me.

PICARD

I have no reason to.

SHINZON

Of course you do.  If you had lived

my life and experienced the

suffering of my people... you'd be

sitting where I am now.  At least I

hope you would.

PICARD

And if you had lived my life you

would understand that there is a

great responsibility in

representing the Federation.  I

can't let my personal feelings

unduly influence my decisions.

SHINZON

All I have is my personal feelings.

I wasn't raised with the ideals of

the Federation.  But I'm trying to

understand them now.  To live up to

them   To live up to you.

SHINZON

I want to know where I come from.

The Remans gave me a future.  You

can tell me about my past.

PICARD

There's so much, and so much of it

is dull...

SHINZON

Were we always explorers?

PlCARD

No.  I was the first Picard to

leave Earth.  It caused quite a

stir, In fact.  But I had spent my

whole life...

SHINZON

(finishing the sentence)

Looking up at the stars.

PICARD

Yes.

SHINZON

And you dreamed about what was up

there.  About...

PICARD

(finishing the sentence)

New worlds.

PICARD

After you, Praetor.

SHINZON

(smiles)

Age before rank, Jean Luc.

PICARD

So I'm not as tall as you expected?

SHINZON

I always hoped I would hit two

meters.

PICARD

With a full head of hair.

SHINZON

(smiles)

There is that.

PICARD

Shinzon... I'm trying to believe

you.

SHINZON

I know.

PICARD

If there's one ideal the Federation

holds most dear it's that all men,

all races, can be united.  From the

first time the Vulcans came to

Earth we've sought a future of

peace.  Nothing would make me more

proud than to take your hand in

friendship.  In time.  When trust

has been earned.

SHINZON

I'm honored to think I might

someday speak with such eloquence.

SHINZON

In time, Jean Luc.

PICARD

In time.

VICEROY

This is a mistake.

SHINZON

He's gentler than I thought.  And

he has a sense of humor.

VICEROY

(stern)

Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.

We should act.  Now.  Time is

running out.

SHINZON

(snaps)

My time.  I'll spend it how I

choose.

SHINZON

We'll return to the Scimitar.

Prepare yourself for the bonding.

WORF

Sir, we've had an unauthorized

access into the main computer.

PICARD

Who was it?

GEORDI

It's going to take some time to

find out -- the data stream was

rerouted through substations all

over the ship.

PICARD

What programs were accessed?

GEORDI

That's what I don't get -- it's

mostly basic stellar cartography:

star charts; communications

protocols; some uplinks from colony

tracking stations.  It's not even

restricted material.

PICARD

(to Worf)

Set up a security program to detect

any unusual data stream rerouting.

If it happens again, we want to be

ready.

GEORDI

(grim)

There's something else.  I was

reviewing the sensor logs...

(he refers to some

readouts on his console)

When the Scimitar decloaked there

was a momentary spike in the

tertiary EM band -- there -- You're

not going to believe this but it's

Thalaron.

PICARD

... I thought Thalaron radiation

was theoretical.

GEORDI

Which is why our initial scans

didn't pick it up.  But he's got

it, Captain.

PICARD

As I remember, Thalaron research

was banned in the Federation

because of its bioqenic properties.

BEVERLY

It has the ability to consume

organic material at the subatomic

level.  I can't overestimate the

danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean

Luc.  A microscopic amount could

kill every living thing on this

ship in a matter of seconds.

PICARD

Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to

know what he has and how to

neutralize any threat.  Give me

options.

DATA

Doctor, will you excuse us for a

moment?  Geordi, please come with

me.

PICARD

Come...

(Beverly enters)

... Beverly, come in.

BEVERLY

You're working late.

PICARD

Remember him?

BEVERLY

He was a bit proud as I recall.

PICARD

He was a damn fool.  Selfish and

ambitious.  Very much in need of

seasoning.

BEVERLY

He turned out all right.

PICARD

I so wanted to believe Shinzon.

But the Thalaron radiation can't be

explained away.  Whatever he's

after, it's not peace.

BEVERLY

Is he very much like you were?

PICARD

Yes.

DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)

Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and

I have identified the source of the

unauthorized computer access.  And,

I believe, we have also discovered

an opportunity to gain a tactical

advantage.

PICARD

(to comm)

On my way...

BEVERLY

(stands)

Jean Luc -- whatever you were --

right now you're the man you've

made yourself.  He's someone else.

PICARD

I wish I could believe that,

Doctor.

SHINZON (V.O.)

Imzadi...

DEANNA

You're not here.

SHINZON

(moving to her)

Very logical, Deanna... But your

heart doesn't constrain itself to

mere logic.

(he caresses her)

... Your heart longs to discover

me.  To know me...

(he kisses her)

... To leave all of this behind and

be with me.

DEANNA

No...

SHINZON

I can feel your desire, Deanna...

SHINZON

I can feel your hunger to know the

Reman ways... the old ways.

SHINZON

Don't fear what you desire...

VICEROY

The bond is broken.

SHINZON

Find her again.

VICEROY

No -- this is wasting time.

SHINZON

Do as I tell you!

REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)

Praetor, we've received the

transponder signal.

SHINZON

(to comm)

On my way.

VICEROY

It's accelerating.  You have no

more time for games.

SHINZON

Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be

on the bridge.

SHINZON

Transport.

SHINZON

Welcome home.

(to Engineers)

Begin the download.

SHINZON

Tea, hot.

BEVERLY

Aside from slightly elevated

adrenalin and serotonin levels,

you're completely normal.

PICARD

(gently)

Can you describe it, Deanna?

DEANNA

It was... a violation.

DEANNA

(with difficulty)

Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the

ability to reach into my thoughts.

I've become a liability... I

request to be relieved of my

duties.

PICARD

Permission denied.  If you can

possibly endure any more of these

assaults.  I need you at my side.

Now more than ever I...

RIKER

(to comm)

Worf!  Raise Shields !

SHINZON

Hello, Jean Luc.

PICARD

Why am I here?

SHINZON

I was lonely...

(he realizes Picard is

staring at the veins on

his face)

Perhaps I'm not aging as well as

you did.

PICARD

(resists)

What are you doing?

SHINZON

I need a sample of your blood.

What do your Borg friends say?

Resistance is futile.

(maniacal laugh)

SHINZON

Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.

I learned there might be an

existing prototype from a

Cardassian historian, then went to

a great deal of trouble to find it

and scatter it about on Kolarus

III.  I knew it would pique your

curiosity and conveniently make the

Enterprise the closest ship to

Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

PICARD

All of this so you could capture

me?

SHINZON

Don't be so vain.  After we found

it, we made a few modifications.

An extra memory port, a hidden

transponder.  Perhaps your eyes

will be a bit less confident when

you learn I've gained access to

Starfleet's communications

protocols.  I now know the location

of your entire fleet...

(to B-9)

... You may go.

B-9

Where?

SHINZON

Out of my sight.

SHINZON

Maybe I'll train it to do little

tricks for me like your robot does.

Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head

off.

PICARD

What's this all about?

SHINZON

It's about destiny, Picard.  About

a Reman outcast who --

PICARD

You're not Reman.

SHINZON

And I'm not quite human.  So what

am I?  What do you see?

(he peers at Picard

deeply)

Do you see a life you might have

led?  Lost youth never to be

recaptured?

PICARD

I see a young man trying

desperately to deny who he is.

SHINZON

I see an old man, set in his ways,

afraid to live without a uniform to

prop him up and a Starfleet

regulation to tell him what to do.

I see the man I will never be.

PICARD

I won't defend my life to you.

SHINZON

My life is meaningless as long as

you're alive.  What am I while you

exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

PICARD

(stern)

If your issues are with me... This

has nothing to do with my ship and

nothing to do with the Federation.

SHINZON

Oh, but it does.  We will no longer

bow like slaves before anyone.  Not

the Romulans and not your mighty

Federation.  We're a race bred for

war.  For conquest.

PICARD

Think about what you're doing,

Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge

the entire quadrant into war to

satisfy your own personal demons?

SHINZON

It amazes me how little you know

yourself.

PICARD

I'm incapable of such an act, and

so are you.

SHINZON

I think the facts speak for

themselves.  The same noble Picard

blood runs in our veins.  Had you

lived my life, you'd be doing

exactly as I am.  Look in the

mirror, and see yourself.

SHINZON

Consider that, Captain.  I can

think of no greater torment for

you.

PICARD

It's a mirror for you as well...

SHINZON

Not for long, Captain.

(back to Picard)

I'm afraid you won't survive to

witness the victory of the echo

over the voice.

WORF

No response to our hails.

GEORDI

(frustrated)

His cloak is perfect... no tachyon

emissions, no residual antiprotons.

RIKER

Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

BEVERLY

Will, I need to talk to you.

B-9

(to Reman guard)

I am to take the prisoner to the

Praetor.

B-9

If you resist, I will incapacitate

you.

VICEROY

(to B-9)

Where are you taking him?

B-9

Praetor Shinzon wants him on the

bridge.

VICEROY

So, human... you've met your better

self!

PICARD

What are you doing to Counsellor

Troi?

VICEROY

I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To

sooth him as she soothes you.  To

stand at his side as she does at

yours.

PICARD

That will never happen.

VICEROY

Listen to him, android.  Such a

small and weak creature.  Yet he

roars so valiantly...

(he raises one taloned

claw and puts a sharp

fingernail on Picard's

chest)

It would take me but an instant to

tear that valiant heart from your

chest.

PICARD

There'll be another after me.  And

another after that.  You'll find

we're a resilient species.

VICEROY

I look forward to the sport.

(to the B-9, harshly)

Take him.

B-9

Move.

PICARD

(whispers)

Be careful of over-playing your

part, Commander!

DATA

Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a

touch of reality to the

performance.

DATA

My mission was a success, sir.  I

have discovered the source of the

Thalaron radiation.

PICARD

Good work.  The download?

DATA

He believes he has our

communications protocols.  But they

will give him inaccurate locations

for all Starfleet vessels.

DATA

Move, puny human animal.

PICARD

A bit less florid, Data.

DATA

Aye, sir... This way.

DATA

This entire ship is, essentially, a

flying Thalaron generator.

(he points up)

All its power relays lead to that

device.

PICARD

A weapon.

DATA

It would appear so.

DATA

Geordi equipped me with the

prototype for the Emergency

Transport Unit.  I recommend you

use it to return to the Enterprise.

PICARD

It'll only work for one of us.

DATA

Yes, sir.

PICARD

We'll find a way off together.

Recommendations?

DATA

There is a shuttlebay 948 meters

from our current location.

VICEROY

Where's Picard?

DATA

This way, sir!

DATA

(looking at door security

panel)

It seems to have an encrypted

security system.

PICARD

Alacrity would be appreciated,

Commander.

DATA

They are trying to override the

access codes.  Reman is really a

most complex language with

pictographs representing certain

verb roots and --

PICARD

While I find that fascinating,

Data, we really need that Goddamned

door open!

DATA

According to the ship's manifest

they are Scorpion-class attack

fliers.

PICARD

(trying to figure out the

controls)

What do you imagine this is?

DATA

Port thrusters, sir.  Would you

like me to drive?

PICARD

Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

DATA

(working controls)

Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.

They have instigated security

overrides and erected a force field

around the external portals.

PICARD

Well then... only one way to go.

DATA

Do you think this is a wise course

of action?

PICARD

We're about to find out... Power up

disruptors and fire on my mark.

DATA

Ready, Captain.

PICARD

Fire!

RIKER

Worf!  Lock on transporters!

SHINZON

Tractor beam!  Now!

PICARD

(to comm)

Number One, emergency warp!

SHINZON

The Enterprise is immaterial!  They

won't make it back to Federation

space.

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)

(angry)

This has gone far enough!

SHINZON

I thought we discussed patience,

Commander.

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)

And mine is wearing thin, young

man!  We supported you because you

promised action.  And yet you delay

and you waste your time playing

games with Picard while --

SHINZON

Commander Suran, the games are

over.  In two days the Federation

will be crippled beyond repair.

Does that satisfy you?

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)

(grim)

For the moment.

SHINZON

(brutal)

And when I return... you and I

shall have a little talk about

showing proper respect!

DONATRA

Does anyone in this room harbor any

illusions about what he means by

"showing proper respect"?

TAL'AURA

What's happening to his face?

SURAN

I want opinions.  He is clearly out

of his mind.

SURAN

But can he complete his mission?

DONATRA

Should he?

DONATRA

Are you prepared to have your hands

drenched in blood?  He'll show them

no mercy.  And his sins will mark

us all for generations.  Is that

what you truly want, Romulans?

DONATRA

I think you should consider that

question now -- or else you may

have a lifetime to think about it

in the dilithium mines.

BEVERLY

The more I studied his DNA the more

confusing it got.  Finally I could

only come to one conclusion...

Shinzon was created with temporal

RNA sequencing.  He was designed so

that at a certain point his aging

process could be accelerated to

reach your age more quickly, so he

could replace you.

PICARD

But the Romulans abandoned the

plan...

BEVERLY

As a result the temporal sequencing

was never activated.  Remember, he

was supposed to replace you at

nearly your current age.  He was

engineered to skip thirty years of

life.  But since the RNA sequencing

was never activated, his cellular

structure has started to break

down.  He's dying.

PICARD

Dying?

RIKER

He wasn't designed to live a

complete, human life span.

PlCARD

Can anything be done for him?

BEVERLY

Not without a complete

myelodysplastic infusion from the

only donor with compatible DNA.

But that would mean draining all

your blood.

RIKER

That's why he went to all that

trouble to capture you.

PlCARD

How long does he have?

BEVERLY

I can't be sure but the rate of

decay seems to be accelerating.

PICARD

Then he'll come for me as a donor.

B-9

Brother.  I cannot move.

DATA

No, I have only activated your

cognitive and communication

subroutines.

B-9

Why?

DATA

Because you are dangerous.

B-9

Why?

DATA

You have been programmed to gather

information that can be used

against this ship.

B-9

I do not understand.

DATA

I know.

DATA

Do you know anything about

Shinzon's plans against the

Federation?

B-9

No.

DATA

Do you have any knowledge of the

tactical abilities of his ship?

B-9

No.  Can I move now?

DATA

No.  I must deactivate you.

B-9

For how long?

DATA

Indefinitely.

B-9

How long is that?

DATA

A long time, brother.

GEORDI

It's called a Cascading Biogenic

Pulse.  The unique properties of

Thalaron radiation allow the energy

beam to expand almost without

limits.  Depending on the radiant

intensity it could encompass a

ship... or a planet.

PICARD

(thinking)

And that's exactly what he's going

to do.

RIKER

Sir?

PICARD

His hatred of the Federation is

apparent.  He would have built a

weapon of that scope for one

reason.  He is going after Earth.

RIKER

Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the

Federation is crippled...

PICARD

And the Romulans invade.

DEANNA

How can you be certain?

PICARD

I know how he thinks.

RIKER

(to Geordi)

And there's no way to penetrate his

cloak?

GEORDI

No, sir.

RIKER

(frustrated)

He could pass within 10 meters of

every ship in Starfleet and they'd

never know.

BEVERLY

But we do have one advantage.

(to Picard)

He needs your blood to live.  He

might come after you first.

PICARD

I'm counting on it... We've been

ordered to head to sector 3274.

Starfleet is diverting the fleet to

meet us there.

RIKER

Strength in numbers?

PICARD

We can only hope so.

PICARD

He can't be allowed to use that

weapon.  All other concerns are

secondary.  Do you understand me?

RIKER

Yes, sir.

PICARD

All hands.  Battle stations.

PICARD (V.O.)

Captain's Personal Log.

Supplemental.  We're heading toward

Federation space at maximum warp.

The crew has responded with the

dedication I've come to expect of

them.  And like a thousand other

commanders on a thousand other

battlefields throughout history, I

wait for the dawn.

PICARD

(quietly)

To seek out new life and new

civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's

own words.  When Charles Darwin set

out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his

journey into the unknown... he

sailed without a single musket.

BEVERLY

(gently)

That was another time.

PICARD

How far we've come.  Let me know if

you need anything.

BEVERLY

Jean Luc...

(he stops)

... He is not you.

PICARD

What makes us who we are, Doctor?

Can you tell me that?

SHINZON

How long?

VICEROY

A matter of hours now --

VICEROY

If you don't begin the procedure

soon you'll never make it back to

Romulus.  You shouldn't have

delayed.  You should have killed

Picard the moment --

SHINZON

How long until we reach the Rift?

VICEROY

(checks a console)

Seven minutes.

PICARD

Show me our current position.

PICARD

How long until we reach the fleet?

DATA

At our current velocity we will

arrive at sector 3274 in

approximately 40 minutes.

PICARD

(quietly)

"For now we see but through a glass

darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

DATA

Of you?

PICARD

Yes.

DATA

I do not agree.  Although you share

the same genetic structure, the

events of your life have created

unique individual.

PICARD

But so much is the same.  On a

biological level he is... and I

will not accept the idea that there

is nothing I can do.  I have a

responsibility to try to make a

human connection with him.

DATA

He would deny a "human" connection

is possible.  He considers himself

entirely Reman.

PICARD

He may have already rejected my

humanity, but you also have a twin.

DATA

No, sir, it is not possible.  The

B-9 is physically identical to me,

although his neural pathways are

not as advanced.  But even if they

were, he would not be me.

PICARD

How can you be sure?

DATA

I aspire, sir.  To be better than I

am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does

Shinzon.

PICARD

We'll never know what Shinzon might

have been.  Had he stood where I

did as a child?  And looked up at

the stars.

DATA

(working controls)

We are passing through the Bassen

Rift.  The projections will return

when we have cleared it.

PICARD

It's interfering with our uplink

from Starfleet cartography?

DATA

Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all

long-range communications --

PICARD

(urgent, to comm)

Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

SHINZON

Target weapons systems and shields.

I don't want the Enterprise

destroyed.

SHINZON

Can you learn to see in the dark,

Captain?

PICARD

Report.

RIKER

He's firing through his cloak.  We

can't get a lock.

GEORDI

(at engineering station)

He disabled our warp drive with his

first shot.  We've only got

impulse.

WORF

Long range communication is

impossible as long as we're in the

rift --

PICARD

Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,

zero elevation.  All banks on my

mark.  Scan for shield impacts and

stand by photon torpedoes.

WORF

Aye, sir

PICARD

Fire!

SHINZON

You're too slow, old man.

(entering commands in his

chair console)

Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

DATA

We are losing dorsal shields --

PICARD

Full axis rotation to port!  Fire

all ventral phasers!

WORF

Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

RIKER

(to Helm)

Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.

Geordi, get those shields online.

PICARD

(to comm)

Counselor Troi, report to the

bridge.

RIKER

Unless we can disable his cloak

we're just going to be firing in

the dark.

PlCARD

Agreed.

WORF

Sir, we're being hailed.

PICARD

On screen.

SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Captain Picard, will you join me in

your Ready Room?

SHINZON

You can't trace my holographic

emitters, Captain.  So don't

bother.  And you can't contact

Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

PICARD

We are.

SHINZON

It's just the two of us now, Jean

Luc, as it should be... Your ship

and mine... You and me.

PICARD

Why are you here?

SHINZON

To accept your surrender.  I can

clearly destroy you at any time.

Lower your shields and allow me to

transport you to my ship.

PICARD

And what of the Enterprise?

SHINZON

I have little interest in your

quaint vessel, Captain.  If the

Enterprise will withdraw to a

distance of one hundred light

years, it will not be harmed.

PICARD

You know that's not possible.

SHINZON

I know... you'll all gladly die to

save your home world.

PICARD

(intense)

Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel

the blood pumping inside you?  Your

hands, your eyes, your nature, are

the same as mine.  Buried deep

inside you beneath the years of

pain and anger is a capacity you've

forgotten.  It's the one way our

mirror can reflect the two of us

exactly because it's the very thing

that truly defines us.  To be human

is to try to make yourself better

than you are.

PICARD

I know you as well as I know

myself, Shinzon.  There was a time

you looked at the stars and dreamed

of what might be.

SHINZON

(quietly)

Long ago.

PICARD

Not so long.

SHINZON

Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in

the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm

what you see now.

PICARD

I see more than what you are.

PICARD

I see what you could be.

PICARD

The man who is Jean Luc Picard and

Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate

the population of an entire planet!

He is better than that!

SHINZON

(desperate)

He is what his life has made him!

PICARD

And what will he do with that life?

PICARD

If I were to beam to your ship...

let you complete your medical

procedure, give you a full life...

what would you do with the time?

PICARD

You once asked me about your past.

Your history.  When I was your age,

I burned with ambition.  I was very

proud and my pride often hurt

people.  I made every wrong choice

a young man can... But one thing

saved me... I had a father who

believed in me.  Who took the time

to teach me a better way.  You have

the same father.

SHINZON

Yes.

PICARD

So if I gave you my life, what

would you do with it?  Would you

spend the years in a blaze of

hatred as you are now?  Or could

you change?  Could you try to

remember a mother's touch you never

felt?  A father's words you never

heard?  Could you do that?

SHINZON

(quietly)

I don't know.

PICARD

But you want to.

PICARD

Let me tell you about our father.

SHINZON

That's your life... not mine.

PICARD

Please.

SHINZON

It's too late.

PICARD

You can still make a choice!  Make

the right one now!

SHINZON

I have no choices!  I can't fight

what I am!

SHINZON

I'll show you my true nature.  Your

nature.  And as Earth dies --

remember that I'm forever Shinzon

of Remus!  And my voice will echo

through time long after yours has

faded to a dim memory.

SHINZON

Disable their weapons!

SHINZON

Report!

REMAN OFFICER

Two ships decloaking, sir!

Romulan!

RIKER

Believe it or not, I think the

cavalry has arrived.

WORF

We're being hailed.

PICARD

On screen.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Captain Picard, Commander Donatra

of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we

be of assistance?

PICARD

Your timing is impeccable,

Commander.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)

The Empire considers this a matter

of internal security.  We regret

you've become involved.

PICARD

When this is over, I owe you a

drink.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to

work.  Valdore out.

PICARD

(to Worf)

You heard the lady.  Get to work.

Move your ass!

PICARD

(to Worf)

Coordinate our attack with the

Valdore's tactical officer.

Triangulate fire on any shield

impacts.

WORF

Aye, sir.

DATA

Aft shields are down to forty

percent.

RIKER

(to Helm)

Keep our bow to the Scimitar.

Auxiliary power to forward shields.

SHINZON

Target the flanking Warbird.  All

forward disruptor banks on my mark.

DATA

Forward shields are down to ten

percent.

RIKER

(to Helm)

Bring us about!

SHINZON

Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the

aft port quadrant and prepare for

full emergency stop.

VICEROY

(startled)

What?!

SHINZON

You heard me.

DONATRA

She's losing her cloak!  Stand by

all forward disruptor banks!

VICEROY

She's almost on us.

SHINZON

Not yet.

VICEROY

Praetor...

SHINZON

FULL STOP AND FIRE !

SHINZON

Restore the aft cloak.and bring us

about.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)

I'm afraid that drink will have to

wait, Captain.

PICARD

Do you have life support?

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)

For the moment.  But we're dead in

the water.

PICARD

Understood --

DATA

We have lost structural integrity

on decks twelve through seventeen,

sections four through ten.

GEORDI

Emergency force fields are holding.

RIKER

Evacuate those decks and reroute

field power to forward shields.

DEANNA

Captain -- I might have a way to

find them.

PICARD

Counselor?

DEANNA

The one thing he may have forgotten

in the course of battle: me.

PICARD

Make it so.

SHINZON

Prepare a lateral run -- all

starboard disruptors.

VICEROY

No!

DEANNA

He's resisting me.

SHINZON

What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

VICEROY

She is here.

DEANNA

Remember me?

DEANNA

NOW!

PICARD

Savage them!

SHINZON

(spinning to his Viceroy)

Prepare a boarding party -- BRING

ME PICARD!

SHINZON

Get the cloak back!  And target

shield coordinates beta three.  All

disruptors.  Fire!

DATA

Captain, we have lost ventral

shielding on deck twenty nine.

PICARD

Divert power and compensate --

WORF

Intruder alert!

RIKER

Let's go.

WORF

(to comm)

Security detail to deck twenty

nine.

RIKER

Worf.

GEORDI

He's getting his cloak back.  We

have exhausted our compliment of

photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are

down to four percent.

PICARD

What if we target all phasers in a

concentrated attack?

DATA

The Scimitar's shields are still at

seventy percent.  It would make no

difference, sir.

DEANNA

They're stopping...

GEORDI

What's he doing?

PICARD

(grim)

He wants to look me in the eye.

PICARD

He thinks he knows exactly what I'm

going to do...

GEORDI

Sir?

PICARD

We've got him!

SHINZON

Open a channel.

DATA

We are being hailed.

PICARD

Deanna, stand by.

(to Data)

Open a channel.

SHINZON (V.O.)

I hope you're still alive, Jean

Luc.

PICARD

I am.

SHINZON (V.O.)

Don't you think it's time to

surrender?  I'll have my cloak back

in a matter of minutes and your

poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why

should the rest of your crew have

to die?

PICARD

I never told you about my first

Academy evaluation, did I?  I

received very high marks for my

studies.  But I was found lacking

in certain other areas.

Personality traits, you might say.

In particular I was thought to be

extremely...

(he glares up at the prow

of the Scimitar)

... over-confident.

PICARD

(quickly)

Geordi, put 211 power to the

engines.  Take it from life support

if you have to -- everything you

can give me.

GEORDI

Aye, sir.

PICARD

Deanna, on my mark.

GEORDI

Ready, sir!

PICARD

(on comm)

All hands, brace for impact!

(to Deanna)

ENGAGE.

SHINZON

HARD TO PORT !

SHINZON

Divert all power to engines.  Full

reverse!

RIKER

Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

PICARD

Data, I need you.

PICARD

Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence

Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize

voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.

Authorization Alpha Alpha Three

Zero Five --

COMPUTER (V.O.)

Auto-destruct is off-line.

SHINZON

Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

REMAN OFFICER

Disruptors are off-line, sir.

SHINZON

Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything

on that ship.  Then set a course

for Earth.

REMAN OFFICER

What about Picard?

SHINZON

Our greater goal is more important,

brother.

REMAN OFFICER

But, Praetor, you won't survive

without him...

SHINZON

Some ideals are worth dying for,

aren't they, Jean Luc?

PICARD

How long until he can fire?

GEORDI

The targeting sequence should take

about four minutes.

DEANNA

But how can he?  He'll kill you.

PICARD

This isn't about me anymore.

PICARD

Prepare for a site-to-site

transport.

GEORDI

(concerned)

Sir, we won't be able to bring you

back.  It's a one way trip.

Captain, I don't know if the

transporter --

PICARD

That's an order, Commander.

DATA

Sir, allow me to go.  You are

needed here.

PICARD

Negative.

DATA

Sir...

DEANNA

Let him go.

PICARD

(to Data)

You have the bridge, Commander.

Use all available power to move

away from the Scimitar.

(to Geordi)

Now, Mister La Forge.

GEORDI

Aye, sir.

GEORDI

That's it.  Transporters are down.

DATA

Counsellor Troi, please assume

command.  Geordi, if you will come

with me.

DATA

What is our approximate distance?

GEORDI

(scans with tricorder)

400 meters.

DATA

Thank you.

DATA

Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the

field.

COMPUTER (V.O)

Forty-seven.  Forty six...

COMPUTER (V.O.)

Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

COMPUTER (V.O.)

Eighteen... Seventeen...

SHINZON

I'm glad we're together now -- our

destiny is complete.

COMPUTER (V.O.)

Ten...Nine...

COMPUTER (V.O.)

Seven..  Six...

DATA

Goodbye.

RIKER

Sir?

DEANNA

Data.

GEORDI

Sir, we're being hailed.

PICARD

On screen...

(he remembers there is no

longer a viewscreen)

... Open a channel.

DONATRA (V.O.)

This is Commander Donatra of the

Valdore.  We're dispatching

shuttles with medical personnel and

supplies.

PICARD

Thank you, Commander.

PICARD

(flat)

Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay

for arrivals.  They don't know our

procedures so just... open the

doors.

GEORDI

I'll take care of it, sir.

PICARD

Number One.

(a beat)

You have the bridge.

PICARD

To absent friends... o family.

PICARD

I don't know if all this has made

sense to you, but I wanted you to

know what kind of man he was.  In

his quest to be more like us, he

helped show us what it means to be

human.

B-9

My brother was not a human.

PICARD

No, he wasn't... But his wonder and

his curiosity about every facet of

human life helped all of us see the

best parts of ourselves.  He

embraced change... because he

always wanted to be more than he

was.

B-9

I do not understand.

PICARD

Well, I hope someday you will.

WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)

Captain, the Hemingway has arrived

to tow us to spacedock.

PICARD

On my way.  Please notify Commander

Riker...

(he stands, prepares to

go)

... We'll talk later?

B-9

"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing

but blue skies do I see."

PICARD

I'm sorry you won't be here for the

re-fit, but I know the Titan needs

you immediately.

PICARD

The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And

she's getting a captain worthy of

her.

RIKER

She's the most beautiful ship I've

ever seen.

(he touches a wall of the

corridor)

... But she's not the Enterprise.

PICARD

I promise you in time, she'll

become your home... If I could

offer you one piece of advice?

RIKER

Anything.

PICARD

When your first officer insists

that you can't go on away

missions... Ignore him --

RIKER

(smiles)

I intend to.

RIKER

(with difficulty)

Serving with you has been an honor.

PICARD

The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

MADDEN

So... what's the old man like?

OPS OFFICER

Why don't you go in and find out?

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.

They're kids!  All with advance

degrees in xenobiology and out to

conquer every disease in the

quadrant.

PICARD

(smiles)

Reminds me of a young doctor I used

to know...

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

They're running me ragged.  Nothing

but questions day and night... I

love it!  Come to dinner and I'll

tell you all about it.  There's a

Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

PICARD

Not tonight, I have work here.

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)

Soon then.  I'll save the last

dance for you.

MADDEN

Commander Martin Madden reporting

for duty, sir.

PICARD

Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,

your transfer didn't come as too

much of a surprise.

MADDEN

I was... honored, sir.

PICARD

I needed you immediately to help

oversee the re-fit...

(gathering up some padds

from his desk)

... Your service record on the

Talos is exemplary, but there are a

few things I would like to discuss

with you regarding my requirements

for a First Officer.  Shall we say

dinner in my quarters at 1900

hours?

MADDEN

Very good, sir.

PICARD

Commander, I don't know how they

did it on the Talos, but we have

door chimes on the Enterprise.  We

use them.

MADDEN

Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

WORF

You don't understand the Captain --

there should be no changes until we

have discussed the modifications

with him.

PICARD

What's this?

WORF

(grumbles)

Your new chair, sir.

ENSIGN

It's the Mark Seven, Captain.

State-of-the-art ergonomics...

command interfaces with --

WORF

I told him you're comfortable with

your old chair.

PICARD

Let's give it a try.

PICARD

Feels good.

ENSIGN

(points)

Try that button, sir.

PICARD

It's about time.

PICARD

Commander, please sit down...

PICARD

... We've received our first

assignment.  We're going to be

exploring the Denab system.  It

should be exciting.  It's a

place... where no one has gone

before.

B-9 (V.O.)

"Never saw the sun shining so

bright, Never saw things going so

right.  Noticing the days hurrying

by, When you're in love, my how

they fly.  Blue days, all of them

gone, Nothing but blue skies from

now on."

FADE OUT.
