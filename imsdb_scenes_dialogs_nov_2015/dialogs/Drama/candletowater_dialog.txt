BROOKE VO

(phone filter)

There's never been anyone like

you, since you. I love you

Vaughn. I love you like no-one

else ever has, or could. I'm not

going to try to persuade you.

Just follow your heart. OK?

FADE IN ON

1.01 INT. SALOON CAR  EVENING

The car is stuck in rush-hour traffic, which surrounds VAUGHN

(40), as he wrestles with the hardest decision of his life.

He speaks into the car mobile phone kit microphone.

VAUGHN

I don't know. I mean I want

you, I want to be with you.

You know that. It's just . . .

He glances at his mobile phone in its car kit dash cradle. The

display says `OFFICE'. The lights of cars outside illuminate

the falling snow, which is beginning to settle on the road.

He waits. No response. No need for one.

VAUGHN

Can you . . . just give me

twenty four hours  OK?

Beat. The dashboard lights seem swirl around him. Stress.

BROOKE OS

(phone filter)

Are you lost? You sound lost.

VAUGHN

Thought I'd try a new way home.

Beat the traffic, you know.

BROOKE OS

(phone filter)

A little girl fell in love with

a little boy. Still falling

over here!

VAUGHN

OK  I'll call you, babe. OK?

SATNAV VOICE

In point two of a mile, keep

right . . .

BROOKE

(laughter, phone filter)

See  even she's on my side!

(beat) I love you Vaughn.

Once upon a time.

VAUGHN

I love you too. I gotta. . .

I'll call you  OK. Bye baby.

BROOKE OS

(phone filter)

Another call. Is it her?

VAUGHN

(hesitant)

Yes.

BROOKE OS

(phone filter)

I guess you better take it.

VAUGHN

I have to go. I'll call you. . .

BROOKE OS

(phone filter)

I know. I figured.

VAUGHN

What does that mean? Look you

know how it is. I'll see you

very soon. Always  OK? Ciao baby.

VAUGHN

Mia. Hi honey.

MIA OS

(phone filter)

Mia? Who's she? It's late.

Pip wants a goodnight kiss.

Where are you? Vaughn?

PIP

Daddy!

MIA (OS)

We're off.

BROOK VO

Once upon a time.

VAUGHN

OK. See you later.

MIA

Pip - you helping me or what?

MIA

(not looking at Vaughn)

Any more takers?

What the fuck is wrong with you?

MIA

Wrong time of the month?

MIA

Don't worry. Seriously.

I love you with every fibre. To the end.

MIA

(still no eye contact)

You out later then darling?

Don't do this to me - please?

VAUGHN

Yeah. Probably. I don't know.

I don't love you anymore.

BROOK VO

Just follow your heart. OK?

MIA

(eventually)

Fine.

Do I disgust you that much?

PIP

But why not? Daddy said we

could. Daddy?

VAUGHN

I'm not sure sweetheart.

BROOK VO

(seductive whisper)

You promised.

MIA

Daddy's not feeling too well,

darling. I'm sure a swim

will do us all good.

PIP

Daddy? Please? Mia said you'd. . .

MIA

Mummy. It's mummy! Who's Mia!?

PIP

Mamma Mia!

VAUGHN

Sure thing, nitwit. Let's

give it half an hour to let

our lunch go down. I'm fine.

Daddy you are a lying piece of shit.

PIP

But why can't daddy come?

MIA

Come on. Milkshakes later!

MIA

I've given you every last atom.

BROOKE

Vaughn Black. Will you come

out and play?

BROOKE

Thank you.

BROOKE

Beer, water or tea? The world's

your oyster.

VAUGHN

How long have you been here?

BROOKE

Three months, four days, seven

and a quarter hours.

VAUGHN

White, one sugar. Thank you.

This is going to work. All I want!

BROOKE

My lord.

BROOKE

What you did . . . I mean I

appreciate what you've done

for me  for us. All I can tell

you is that it will be worth it.

We're meant to be together, V.

You've always said that.

VAUGHN

Come on. You don't owe me

anything. I made a choice.

BROOKE

I've been waiting to show you.

VAUGHN

My God, Brooke. It's . . .

BROOKE

You want to grab a shower. We

should go out and celebrate.

VAUGHN

You're telling me I stink. Mea

culpa!

BROOKE

No!

VAUGHN

I'll take a shower.

BROOKE

I'll show you. Might even

watch you. A man in my shower.

The little boy a little girl fell

in love with. Once upon a time.

VAUGHN

(the boy inside)

He's still in there somewhere.

BROOKE

And now . . .

BROOKE

(eventually)

I'm so sorry.

Accept me - I beg you.

VAUGHN

(hushing her)

Don't be daft. I'm sorry. It's. . .

You're damaged. How can I want you?

BROOKE

You don't need to be. Take

your time.

Whatever happens, please. . .

VAUGHN

An accident? You didn't tell me.

What the hell happened?

BROOKE

It's nothing. Really.

Accept me.

VAUGHN

All in good time  OK?

Tell me now.

BROOKE

We have forever. Oh my love.

Accept me.

BROOKE

We have forever. Promise?

BROOKE

Good day, bad day . . ?

If this doesn't work . . .

BROOKE

Got something for you lover-boy.

I will do anything.

VAUGHN

Thank you.

Why didn't you tell me!? Stupid!

BROOKE

So now you've got everything

you need here. So now . . .

It will be your fault, your responsibility.

VAUGHN

Brooke, look. . .

Forgive me.

BROOKE

Brooke? You never call me that.

VAUGHN

My love.

VAUGHN

What happened?

BROOKE

What happened?

BROOKE

What happened?

VAUGHN

(eventually)

Pip's with mum?

What have I done?

VAUGHN

How is she?

My family is my world. Forgive me.

MIA

Don't start, Vaughn. What kind

of a fucking stupid question

is that? How's my daughter

now that I've walked out on her

and her mother and run into

the arms of my childhood

sweetheart?

MIA

Jesus  the false caller IDs on

your phone. `Office'? I mean

please. And remember eye contact?

You should try private browsing

or at least clear your history

every now and again. For someone

who's in fucking IT . . . So

what now? You want some clothes,

your tool box, the toaster:

a divorce?

MIA

Have them all. On the house.

MIA

Now fuck off, please? It's

over. You piece of shit . . .

MIA

What am I supposed to do now,

bastard: tell me, tell me, tell. . .

SATNAV VOICE

In point two of a mile, keep

right . . .

VAUGHN

Babe? (nothing, so) Brooke?

BROOKE

Boo!

BROOKE

What's wrong?

VAUGHN

Nothing.

What d'you think? Were you always this stupid?

BROOKE

Blimey  someone lost their

sense of humour.

BROOKE

I thought you'd be pleased for

me. I got a job!

VAUGHN

That's brilliant. When?

I don't care anymore.

BROOKE

Start on Monday. It'll be good

for us  we can be DINKYs.

I beg you with all my life.

VAUGHN

It's great  really.

Forgive me  I want only that.

BROOKE

You're hungry. Thirsty? Let

me get you a drink. Drink for

my king. Then maybe . . .

VAUGHN

Tell me! For God sake . . .

VAUGHN

Who did this to you?

BROOKE

Does it matter? He was jealous.

He's everything you're not.

Vaughn? You love me. Baby?

You don't need to fear him.

They're just scars. Oh God, no.

Vaughn? They're just scars

for God sake. This is my body!

BROOKE

Can you see properly? Can you?

(of her scars) Do you like them?

VAUGHN

(incredulous)

Why didn't you tell me?

BROOKE

Smart question Vaughn, smart.

BROOKE

Love me.

BROOKE

Love me!

BROOKE

Love me, bastard! COWARD!

BROOKE

It doesn't matter. (long beat)

Go back to her. Go back to mama.

It's where you belong.

BROOKE

Go forever. Now.

Story #2

`Stanislavski'

DOLORES

. . .though normally there's

a charge for that.

CY

Of course there is.

DOLORES

Here we go.

DOLORES

There you go.

DOLORES

(into the phone)

Well I can't be two places at

once, now can I. (then) Sure.

(then) Mo's around somewhere.

No. (then) I will. (then) OK.

DOLORES

Here he is now. (calls out) Mo?

DOLORES

Mo? Mo  could you please just

see Mister Caudwell out? He

just needs to pick something up.

MO

No sweat Doll.

DOLORES

Dolores! How many more times?

MO

No worries Doll.

DOLORES

Sorry mister Caudwell. Mo here

will see you out. I have to . . .

CY

OK (indifferent) thanks.

CY

Thanks.

MO

No sweat.

MO

Wow  that's an old VHS isn't it?

CY

It is indeed. Are we done?

MO

Ain't seen one of those for

years. Never used one.

CY

Really.

MO

Wait  I gotta sign you out man.

Paperwork. You got the forms?

CY

Man? What the hell happened

to `sir'?

MO

Sir? You're a knight? The

queen dub you or something?

If I don't call you sir that

doesn't mean I don't respect.

It just means I don't call you sir.

CY

Fine. It doesn't really matter.

Sorry.

MO

Wait  you're that director.

CY

Can we please just finish up

and go. I'm late.

MO

Seriously  I know you. I'm an

actor. We met once. Maybe . . .

CY

You've got the wrong man.

MO

No seriously. We met at an

audition. You auditioned me.

MO

You must remember. I'm not doing

this forever. Got plans to do

things. Get my CV together. You

must remember.

CY

Like I said . . .

CY

The fuck do you think you're

doing?

MO

Take it easy. I'm only asking.

CY

How the hell do we . . .

CY

What the hell are you doing?

MO

Come on man  just a j-peg to

let my buddies know I saw you.

I photograph everything. Got

gigs of shit at home. But you

you're the man who directed. . .

CY

A sign or two might help.

MO

Exit? It's cool. Listen we

won't do the (indicates his

phone, which he puts away). . .

But slow down: you must

remember me. You're  that's it:

name begins with C. . .

CY

OK. What the fuck is the matter

with all this? I've got my thing,

now I just want to get out of

here. Let's sign the papers

and I can't quite believe there

are papers  and I'm done. Clear?

MO

Clear. So what's on the (the

VHS) video?

CY

Jesus. Mind my business is on

the video. Is that all right?

MO

It's fine, bro; but hostility

ain't working. Not in here.

MO

It was that show - that play you

were directing. Silver something.

Shit. Four, five years back.

Come on, man  you must remember.

CY

OK. I remember. So can we go now?

MO

Sure, but look: what's with all

the storage. You moving house

or something?

CY

Something like that. Look: show

me the way out of here now, man,

or I'll have to speak to your

supervisor. What was her name?

Dorothy?

MO

Shit no: Doll's just admin.

Works up in the box.

MO

Dolls in the doll house, doing

doll things. Bless.

CY

Out. Now.

MO

Whoa. Relax Mister C. Out is

way. OK?

MO

Look I don't want you to mind

me talking to you and all. I'm

just being friendly: one pro

to another. (beat) Come on man.

Don't go believing this is

my shit, because it ain't.

Acting's my shit just like

directing's yours. I was born

to it  know what I mean?

I knew you'd remember. Cy

that's it! Cy. Mo.

MO

Well that's better. No need

for hostility between pros.

CY

(looking around for exit)

How hard can this be?

MO

(as Cy speaks, above)

Pros or ho's  know what I'm

saying.

MO

What's on the video? None of

my biz, I know; but I'm curious.

CY

If you must know, it's a show-

reel. An old one.

MO

Yup. Got the old bit. (looks

at the VHS. Old) Wow. (laughs)

Ain't you got one online?

Mine's online.

CY

Right. Get us the fuck out of

here or I'm going to . . .

MO

Look sorry about that dude, but

you need to let me know. That's

my simple question: what happened.

CY

What happened?

MO

The audition. I didn't get the

job.

MO

(eventually)

Seriously. The Silver thing.

CY

Look I don't know. Actors

we would have seen dozens. I

mean it was a long time ago.

I don't know what you mean

`what happened'.

CY

If you didn't get it, you didn't

get it. It's the - (nervous laugh)

- it's the way of the world, no?

CY

This is ridiculous.

MO

I know how good you are.

MO

I know your true potential.

I know your talent doesn't

belong packed up in here. Your

greatness. And you've failed.

CY

What are you doing?

MO

You don't think I know how you

(more)

(cont'd)

feel. I feel it. In here. I

feel failure in here every day

and every fourth Sunday. I feel

like brilliance left to rot,

too. That's how you feel  no?

You feel it when it wakes you

to tap on your shoulder and

say `this is what you could

have been, this is what you are'

Storage boxes? What happened?

CY

(shocked)

What the fuck business is it . . .

If I held an audition you failed

four or five years ago I'm sorry.

If you're working in here not

up in lights, I'm sorry.

MO

You're sorry for yourself.

That's in your face.

CY

This is fucking absurd. (of

his broken phone) Criminal

damage. Threatening behaviour.

MO

Cy  we're done here, seriously.

Then I'll sign you out. You can

ask about the mobile phone you

dropped; but I doubt you can

claim it on us. Just tell me

why you're all stored up in here.

Then . . .

CY

Mo, isn't it? What does that

mean  `Mo'? In any event I can

promise you repercussions. I

don't care what you think of me.

I won't be treated like this.

MO

Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius.

Solid citizen I don't think. Just

need to know what you're doing.

Then that's the end of it all.

CY

My landlord asked me to move out.

MO

Couldn't pay your rent. Why

don't you just say that.

I couldn't pay my rent, Mo.

That's fine. It's called la

crunch du credit. And here we are.

MO

We're almost, nearly, seriously

out of here, Mister Caudwell.

MO

On timers  saves power. You

must know. Auto-ma-tic.

MO

Time to go home, Cy. My only

ask is this. And you don't

have to say yes, say anything.

All I ask is we do it again.

MO

(strange laugh)

I know. I know it sounds strange.

Bit silly even. But if you just

let me run the thing again,

this time I'll nail it  swear.

MO

(of the VHS in Cy's hand)

I mean. On a fucking VHS video

cassette. Where's Noah when you

need him?

MO

Let's run this again from the

top, Cy.

CY

You'll go down for this. I

absolutely swear. I'll report

this to the police, your

superiors. This is fucking . . .

CY

You think you can actually

DO THIS?! What the fuck. . .

CY

What the fuck, sunshine. Equity

subscriptions lapsing are they?

MO

Cy, seriously, man who directed

nothing: let's just get this

right. Then we can get on

with things. You can go back

your self-loathing and I

can continue my rounds.

CY

What!? Screw you. (loud, to

anyone again for help) FUCK YOU!

CY

What the fuck is the matter

with you? Jesus Christ!

MO

Jesus not in here, bro. Christ

a nipple sucked by mugs. One

born every minute, tick tock.

MO

OK. So what's the brief?

CY

What?

MO

What's the scenario? Set the

scene for me. Point me in the

right direction. Even Brando

needed goalposts.

CY

Help. HELP!

MO

No sweat, Doll. Just relax.

This place is damn big. And

you're talking to the big expert

here. (shows Cy his shoes) Gotta

do a circuit every hour. (beat)

We gonna just do this thing,

then it's home free. OK? Relax.

MO

That's it old fella. Get sorted

out. In and out. Let it all

be cool.

CY

You'll be missed.

MO

Well not really Mister De Mille.

It's just me and Doll today.

Cutbacks. Don't ya love them?

MO

Set me straight, mister director!

MO

The director's chair.

CY

What the fuck do you want?

MO

You know what I want. Just like

you: another chance. Audition

me again, you fucking VHS crumb.

Give me my brief. Motivation,

reality  the whole bit. Go.

CY

Do what you want, wanker.

CY

You'll do time. Fucking acting.

You'll go down. I'll see to it.

Think you can fucking do this.

MO

Again. The scenario, please Cy.

Who am I? What do I want?

CY

OK crackerjack. Let's play.

You're a fucked up wannabe

actor who never was and never

will be who works as a security

guard in a domestic storage depot.

Like most people you can't

handle rejection, but I mean

you really can't handle it

really I mean. It's just . . .

MO

Good dog. Now. . .

MO

That wasn't the character I read

for, the last one I mean. My

agent told me a soccer player

who is afraid to tell his team-

mates of his homosexuality.

He turns to his manager for

help, for answers to his

dilemma; but in the face of

this, of this outrage, the

manager who has been like a

surrogate father to him for

years now turns against him,

disgusted that the boy he

believed in turned out to

be a lamentable sausage jockey.

Am I right?

MO

I'm right, man. That was the

scenario wasn't it. The Silver

thing I auditioned for that

you turned me down for. Wrong.

Ignored me for. Like the loser

I was. Wrong. The winner is

here. In front of you. So. . .

MO

Make like a camera.

MO

Noises.

MO

Without a script this time,

note. Ad-libbing, free wheeling

improvisazione, herr director!

MO

(in character)

All my life. Imagine living

a lie  forever. Not just the

lies everybody lives day to

day to get by, play the game;

but one big lie that stretches

from beginning to end: a truth

so hideous that it could be

called ordinary. A verity of

the genes, of psychology.

And then imagine the one

person the liar could turn to

turning away, so that the liar

was left with nothing but the

lie. Imagine exploding with

the desire to be what you

are, to be real, and to be

accepted for what you are,

perhaps even loved. Not loved

with money for playing games,

but loved with respect for

having the strength to stand

apart. Imagine that. But the

works of the imagination must

cede to that we call reality.

(more)

(cont'd)

And here we are, you choosing

the side of the mob and me

left outside in the cold. Well

I've got news for you, turncoat:

I don't fucking care. I've got

the future. TTFN, blood. TT forever.

MO

Cy. Director. Really.

MO

So, how was I? How was it?

CY

You did it. You got the job.

MO

LIAR!

DOLORES

Cuppa, Mo? Mo?

Thank you Mister Mountjoy.

COP (cont'd)

Oh thank you Mister Mountjoy.

My brand: Costmart's own!

(smiles, then, to Austen) All

I need to know is where your

brother Jaden is at the moment,

Austen. When was the last time

you saw him? You say he

normally lives here: where is

he now, today?

JADEN

Why you fuckin' grass me up.

Though you was my brah.

AUSTEN

I didn't tell the pigs. Just

Couldn't help it.

AUSTEN

What the pigs gonna do with ya?

JADEN

Only way you're gonna stop me

I'll be there soon as. OK?

AUSTEN VO

(Jaden's memory)

Only way you're gonna stop me

turning into you is by killing

me, brah.

JADEN

Got a better idea, baby blood.

Story #4

`Mea Culpa'

WIFE

Won't be long.

URI VO

But now the buck must stop.

Exculpation is no longer

an option. The state has

lied to you, Mrs Pentane, and

whatever the consequences, I

feel it my duty to put the

record straight. Why I feel

thus obliged will become

apparent should we meet. I

leave that up to you.

THUG#2

Get some deep heat on it.

If we're kindly ready, Mister Tyne.

Not yet sir.

Yes sir.

might have been contaminated.

BOOTHY

(not impressed)

Was there any form of extraction?

URI

The suspect revealed nothing of

the activities of which he was

suspected by the board, sir.

PARKER

Fruit was not born.

URI

It was a fruitless interrogation,

sir - yes.

BOOTHY

So not only do we have no further

intel about the event, we

have another next of kin, a

nuclear bloody winter of media

fallout and the inevitable

Whitehall storm. We also have

another body to . . .

PARKER

Liquidate, sir?

BOOTHY

(refers to laptop)

It says here `The suspect did

not respond to the usual stimuli.

(at Uri) Stimuli? The usual . . .

URI

We explored the usual routes

in accordance with our mandate.

SILK

(to Boothy)

If I may, sir. (to Uri) Perhaps

he told you nothing because he

knew nothing.

URI

That's likely, yes.

BOOTHY

Likely? Christ! This is the kind

of thing the media gorges on

for months! We can't . . .

URI

There is no need.

URI

Nicholas Pentane died while

engaged in activities commensal

with his profession as a

freelance reporter from wounds

sustained at the hands of

insurgent personnel. He died

behind enemy lines. He was

transported home in a manner

befitting a hero. He died

while attempting to maintain

the integrity and vibrancy of

a free press  a press we all. . .

BOOTHY

Spare me the party line, Uri,

for God sake! This'll wiki

itself sky high unless . . .

URI

It's taken care of, sir.

BOOTHY

We're getting off-message here.

PARKER

Mission creep.

BOOTHY

What we're here to establish is

how a freelance writer get's

wrongly arrested, subjected to

(makes quotation marks with his

fingers) rendition and is then

tortured by experts in the

certainty that he is in fact

a terrorist planning acts

against the common good. On

home soil against the Great

British public et cetera.

(beat) He was as innocent as

any of us. Any answers, Uri?

URI

Mistakes, happen, sir.

BOOTHY

The man wrote a column for the

Economist, for God sake!

URI

The best moles have the best

covers, sir. They simply

always do.

BOOTHY

What we also need to establish

is whether he was killed

deliberately, or by . . .

PARKER

Misadventure, sir?

URI

The human body can only take so

much, sir. Subjected to a

certain level of pressure it

buckles. Nicholas Pentane's

body simply broke under duress.

SILK

The mind-body continuum.

URI

The mind-body continuum.

BOOTHY

NP was arrested on the night of

the fourth (reads more then)

Transported under guard to

the facility. Work began on

the seventh to determine. . .

BOOTHY

So what was going on between

the fourth and the seventh?

URI

I was on holiday, sir.

SILK

Ah. Anywhere nice?

URI

Malaga again, sir. My wife does

like it there.

BOOTHY

Well not a bad choice at that

time of year. We recommended

that to do didn't we?

URI

You did, sir, yes. Your wife

actually sent us the brochure

if you recall.

ELLE

Hello. (then, disappointed)

Yes. (then, with dread) Yes.

BOOTHY VO

We actually tried Corfu this

year. Not bad  though it could

have been warmer.

SILK VO

I can actually recommend Crete

at this time of year. A bit

populous, but there are places

where one can escape the hordes.

BOOTHY

Oh Lord, Michael; if we left it

to you we'll all be holidaying

on the Norfolk Broads!

BOOTHY

What we're left with is

something of a mess. I'm sure

you agree.

URI

Sorry sir I don't suppose we

could get some . . . I'm . . .

BOOTHY

(into the intercom)

Sharon could we get some more

coffee please. (to the others)

Biscuits? (the others nod except

Uri) And some biscuits. The

usual. Actually if there are

any chocolate digestives.

SHARON OS

(on the intercom)

Certainly sir.

BOOTHY

(into the intercom)

Thanks Sharon.

URI

My desire to meet with you

arises from a strong urge to

inform you of the circumstances

under which your husband

actually passed away. The fact

is, Mrs Pentane, that you have

certainly been misinformed.

BOOTHY

Thanks Sharon.

PARKER

(mouth full)

Never can resist the bloody

things.

BOOTHY

(to Parker)

Make yourself at home, minister.

URI

Bloody hell!

ELLE

Yes?

ELLE

Hello?

URI

Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow

from the ministry. We spoke

earlier?

ELLE

Ah  yes. Come in.

URI

Mrs Pentane very good of you

to see me like this.

ELLE

Come in Mister Tallow.

URI

Lovely, just lovely. This is

yours? Goodness.

URI

It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . .

ELLE

Can I get you anything?

URI

No  really I'm fine. Thank you.

URI

Such platitudes! Here we are

trapped inside a Terrence

Rattigan three act . . .

URI

Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject

of course. Your husband.

URI

Good, old fashioned paper.

Nothing like it.

URI

Firstly I'm so very sorry for

your loss. I know the ministry

has informed you that your

husband  Mr Nicholas . . .

URI

Misses Pentane the fact is that . . .

URI

The truth is Misses Pentane

that . . . I'm here to tell you

that . . . Well this may not

be what you want to hear but . . .

ELLE

(get the fuck out)

If you'd kindly hurry. Please.

URI

Misses Pentane I . . .

URI

Misses Pentane . . .

ELLE

Oh for God sake!

URI

The fact is that your husband

did not die in the manner in

which you have been told he

died. As I alluded in my

letter, my email. . .

ELLE

I can't do this now. I'm sorry.

URI

Misses Pentane please hear me.

(more)

(cont'd)

Why did I come here today?

Well, the truth is I believe

you should have the facts. The

facts are that. . .we believe

your husband was wrongfully

arrested and . . .

ELLE

You need to get the hell away

from me. Sorry, but. . .

URI

Misses Pentane the fact is that

your husband was subjected to

rendition. Not as you may have

heard of it but in a form. . .

URI

Whilst in this instance your

husband wasn't transported

abroad because of logistics.

ELLE

(a whisper)

Logistics?

URI

He was subjected here, in the

United Kingdom to a process

designed to get him to confess.

BOOTHY

What we need to establish, Uri,

is whether, having found out

(more)

(cont'd)

that you had made a mistake,

you killed Nicholas Pentane

deliberately, or whether his

death was merely a product of

of the processes to which he

was being subjected.

URI

He was no longer any use. By

that stage his body was, his

mind. . .He would never have

been able to lead an ordinary

life: work, have relationships.

BOOTHY

So you did the judicious thing

and disposed of the suspect

accordingly?

URI

Your husband was tortured,

Misses Pentane.

URI

These are measures taken

occasionally and in conditions

of the utmost secrecy against

certain suspects accused of

terrorism  I'm sure you're aware.

ELLE

DON'T TOUCH ME!

ELLE

Get out. Now.

URI

This isn't exactly what I came

here to tell you, Misses . . .

Not entirely. . .

URI

What I came here to tell you

today that it was me. I oversaw

the torture and tortured your

husband. It was under my

ministrations . . .

URI

It was me, you see. I killed

him. An accident. Only so much.

URI

I know this is a lot to take

in, Misses Pentane.

ELLE

What are you?

ELLE

I'm calling the police.

URI

That won't help much today.

ELLE

What the fuck do you think. . .

Get out  now!

ELLE

Fucker! GET THE FUCK OUT!

ELLE

What do you want from me?

URI

I want. I want. . .

URI

Wait. Wait please.

URI

OK.

ELLE

Piece of shit-mould. Get out. . .

ELLE

This is what you fucking want?

Fuck. . .(sobbing) Oh Jesus. . .

ELLE

Motherfucker . . .

URI

Yes (blow) Yes (blow) Yes (blow).

ELLE

Piece of dogshit . . .

URI

Misses Pentane . . . the

exertion. Please . . .

ELLE

What? (incredulous) WHAT?

URI

I relieved him of his pain.

ELLE

Am I expected to admire . . .

Leave me alone.

URI

It's OK. I don't want you to

be . . . I'll make up a story.

Don't worry. (beat) Actually

I hate it all. (beat) I do as

I'm told, actually. Sometimes . . .

ELLE

Get out.

URI

Don't worry. Mum's the word,

Mrs Pentane. I'll take care of

everything. Everything. I promise. . .

Story #5

`Jeremy Bentham'

AD VO

. . .not that you'll be needing

one now that your house

assurance is on the house. Cheers!

FEMALE DJ VO

So welcome back and if you've

just joined us welcome: I'm

talking to Chris Marlow, the

barrister who represented

decorated Afghanistan para

veteran Shona Barnes earlier

this year. If you recall, Shona

was sentenced to seven years

in Wormwood Scrubs for the

murder of Caleb Rounds  the

man who broke into her house,

shot and held her hostage for

several hours on the night of

March the twelfth last year.

Chris  so . . . in your

opinion Shona's Post-Traumatic

Stress Disorder, a condition

she suffered following action. . .

an incident with an IED in

Helmand Province in Afghanistan

in May two thousand and ten,

(more)

(cont'd)

an incident that killed a

close colleague of hers and

resulted in Shona being

pensioned, invalided out of

the army. In your opinion Chris,

this - the PTSD - should have

been crucial to the decision

not to prosecute Shona for

murder, a charge you now feel

should have been reduced to

what: manslaughter? She didn't

seem like much of an invalid

in the way she dealt with Rounds

did she? So for you - was this

a travesty of justice? Really?

MARLOW VO

My sense of it is, Christie,

as I've said, and the reason I

feel I failed, really, is that

the state must find a way

to take responsibility.

FEMALE DJ VO

But now you're considering

retiring? With a future as

QC certain. A Law Lord perhaps.

You're regarded by many as a

(laughs) legal wunderkind!

MARLOW VO

Well I don't know about that.

But yes, I'm looking to move

out of the legal profession now.

FEMALE DJ VO

Because of this case, specifically?

As Queens Council you could help

people like Shona. Lots of Shonas.

MARLOW

I know. But look. For me it's

this: we send her out to

Afghanistan. We tell her to kill

people who resisted our invasion.

(as the DJ starts to speak) But

(more)

(cont'd)

anyway  look: we make her

an expert. A killing machine.

And then war breaks our machine.

So then our machine needs

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

drugs in order to function in

normal life. To make a cup of

tea, for God sake. (silence a

beat, then) She's a broken

child, Chrissie. We broke her.

So then when she kills a known

psychotic child molester and

murderer in her home in the

middle of the night  in her

home - in self-defence  we,

the state, we call that murder,

and we throw her to the dogs. We

screw her up in the name of a

cause in some country some

people - and lets' face it,

in a part of the world not

many British people know or

give a damn about - and then we

finish the job. We prosecute her

for murder and lock her up.

FEMALE DJ VO

But ultimately the only

alternative is that we don't

have a professional, a standing

army. We rely on . . .

MARLOW VO

I understand. I understand

that when you sign up, you

take your chances. You become

an organ of the state, and if

that state tells you to kill

people in its name, it chooses

not to call that murder. It

chooses then to call you a

hero  especially if you die.

FEMALE DJ VO

So these young people, the

soldiers who give their lives

in the defence of our liberty

(more)

(cont'd)

don't deserve the label hero.

Is that what you're saying?

MARLOW VO

Nation states have always

protected themselves from their

own imperial absurdities. What

would be left if there was no

chance of glory? Why would anyone

sign up? Look: in war, anywhere,

people do what they can to

survive. All I can say is that

personally, I mean as Shona's

brief, I failed to make the court

see sense. For me, you know, it's

like you can murder in the so

called defence of the state but

if you kill in the defence of

yourself . . .You know it's

like, I mean as Shakespeare

said `if his cause be wrong,

our obedience to the king

wipes the crime of it out of us.'

CALEB

What the fuck  easy-peasy, ho!

CALEB

A bitch. I been had by a bitch!

SHONA
