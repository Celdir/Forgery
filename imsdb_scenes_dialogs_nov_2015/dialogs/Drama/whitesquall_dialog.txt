WHITE SQUALL

Revised First Draft

October 31, 1994

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

Though I hadn't seen or spoken to

Sheldrake in over thirty years, it

seemed impossible that his heart was

the thing that had finally failed

him...

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

I never got close to him, nobody

did.  But by the time we made Tampa,

I was sure I knew who he was, that I

understood what he saw, what

nourished his soul and tested his

faith...

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

He had taken us to worship, where,

what was for him, the holiest of

holies.  And, for us too by the

end...

IN MEMORY OF NATALIE "ALICE" SHELDRAKE M.D.,

CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE

BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961

MINISTER

I didn't know Richard Sheldrake

personally, but his many friends who

knew and worked with him, wanted to

make sure that he was returned home,

here, to be remembered with his

beloved wife...

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

Though he had moved on with his

life, now even for the years, to

hear him eulogized by strangers,

seemed strange.  He had been a

hewner of stones, a pilot by the

silent stars.  Like me, alone among

many.  But most of all for us, the

crew of the brigantine Albatross, he

was always and would forever be...

our Skipper.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILL

You gonna jump?  Or are you just

having a last look?

CHUCK

I was just thinking that I never had

a new pair of shoes till I was

twelve.

WILL

It's no my fault I was born first.

Besides, nobody ever sent me on an

eight month vacation, so ease up on

the sad sack stuff.

CHUCK

It's not a vacation, it's private

school.

WILL

I thought this was your dream come

true.

CHUCK

That's not why he's sending me.

WILL

Why then.

CHUCK

Because it looks good.

CHUCK

I'm just not like you.  Ya know?

I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm

never going to be "William".

WILL

Nobody says you have to be like me.

CHUCK

He does.

WILL

You don't give him enough credit

Chas.

WILL

We better go.

CHARLES

(ticked)

You plan on making this plane or

not?

WILL

Don't take any wooden nickels

Kemosabe.

CHUCK

I won't.

WILL

And lighten up will ya.

CHARLES

Now just take it easy.  We're not

going to a fire.

MIDDY

Honey, did you know that the

Albatross was captured by the

Germans during World War II?

CHUCK

No, I didn't.

MIDDY

It says she was originally Schooner

rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned

her into a brigantine.  I think

square rigs look so much more

romantic.

CHUCK

Me too.

CHARLES

Appearances aren't everything.  Keep

your mind on the road.

CHARLES

What are you doing?

CHUCK

I don't feel like driving.  Okay?

MIDDY

Do you have your ticket?

CHUCK

Yes.

MIDDY

Passport?

CHUCK

Look, I just better go.

CHUCK

Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.

MIDDY

I know you will.

CHARLES

Make us proud.

CHUCK

Yes sir.

RICK

Albatross?

CHUCK

Yeah.

RICK

Rick March.  Who the hell are you?

CHUCK

Gieg, Chuck.

RICK

Look, meet us out front when you're

through.  If they try to take

anything away from you like Johnny

Quest up there, just make a list and

we'll have 'em send it down to the

boat.

CHUCK

Whatever.

RICK

Hey, hey!!  That's my stuff!!

TOD

Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no,

it's sweet to be back in the world

of rum and honey.

RICK

I gotta admit I never thought you'd

be back after the great "Bowsprit

Affair".

TOD

Me and Skipper had a meeting of the

minds.

CHARLIE

How's that?

TOD

I begged.

CHUCK

(warming a little)

What the "Bowsprit Affair"?

RICK

Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch

and managed to sweet talk one of the

local girls to have a go in the

bowsprit.

TOD

Not just any 'local' girl.

RICK

The 'local' mayor's 'local'

daughter.

CHARLIE

Thing is, the net in the basket

isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o

wraps them up in the jib.  After the

deed was done...

RICK

He says they did the deed...

TOD

Trust me, we did the deed.

CHARLIE

After the "alleged" deed was done,

they fell asleep.  Big Daddy Lawford

comes on deck at four bells and

hears Casanova sawing logs.

TOD

Believe me, I needed the rest...

CHARLIE

He gets the whole crew on deck, gets

us on the halyard, and orders the

old "heave ho...".

RICK

Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o

and the mayor's daughter, naked as

pilot whales...

CHARLIE

(to Tod)

I don't know who was more surprised,

you or Big Daddy.

TOD

To tell you the truth, I think it

was her father.

RICK

Well gentlemen, there she is.

CHARLIE

Home sweet hell on the water.

CHUCK

What happened to it?

BILL

She cleans up.  We'll have her ship

shape before we shove off.

LAWFORD

"That this same child of honor and

renown, This gallant Hotspur, this

all praised knight, And your

unthought-of Harry chance to meet.

For every honor sitting on his helm,

Would they were multitudes, and on

my head.  My shames redoubled!  For

the time will come...

LAWFORD

... That I shall make this northern

youth exchange, his glorious deeds

for my indignities."

TOD

Would you be addressing me, sir?

LAWFORD

I would.

RICK

What's that supposed to mean?

LAWFORD

(beat)

Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii.

I suggest you read it.

CHARLIE

It means Shakespeare.  B-o-r-i-n-g.

BILL

It means if he catches anybody

basket-napping on watch this

passage, he's gonna use their lizard

for 'cuda' bait.

RICK

(lightly)

Well that's a hell of a how-do-you-

do.

BILL

Drop your gear, go below and pick

yourself some bunks.

RICK

Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg.

ROBIN

I'm Robin.

ROBIN

(flat)

That's my brother.  He's dead.

JOHN

I'll take this one.

TERRY

You probably didn't notice, but this

bunk has been taken.

JOHN

Anybody gotta problem with that?

RICK

(beat)

Absolutely not.

BILL

Alright, listen up.  This is Dr.

Alice Sheldrake.

ALICE

I'm ship's surgeon.  I'm in charge

of aches, pains, biology, math and

science.

BILL

George Pascal here is ship's cook.

GEORGE

If you want to keep all your

fingers, stay the hell out of my

galley unless you're invited.

BILL

Some of you already know Mr.

Lawford.

LAWFORD

I have been charged with the dubious

task of insuring your literary

education.

LAWFORD

Bill Butler is your first mate.  But

don't let his size fool you.

MIKE

So when the hell do we get to meet

El Capitan?

TERRY

(aside)

Maybe he's getting his wooden leg

waxed.

LAWFORD

(mysterious)

You'll meet him.  Soon enough.

LAWFORD (O.S.)

Arise, Arise, Arise...

LAWFORD (O.S.)

Exultation is the going/ Of an

inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/

Past the headlands/ Into deep

Eternity/ Bred as we, among the

mountains/ Can the sailor

understand/ the divine intoxication/

of the first league out from land?

(pause)

But I suppose we'll answer that

question soon enough gentlemen.

Soon enough.

TERRY

What question?

ROBIN

(foggy)

What the hell is going on?

CHUCK

Maybe it's an air raid.

BILL

Roll out sailors!  All hands on

deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty

seconds.

BILL

You gotta problem Goodall?

JOHN

You blow that thing again I'll shove

it so far up your ass, you're gonna

need dental floss to get it out.

BILL

Just get on deck.

BILL

Line up!  Single file.  Single file.

BILL

Everybody swims.

LAWFORD

Don't think people, just go!  Go,

Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,

stay you pay!!

BILL

Now what's the problem, Goodall?

Everybody swims.

JOHN

I don't.

LAWFORD

You will if you wanna eat.  Right

George?

JOHN

(to Bill)

You gonna swim for your breakfast?

LAWFORD

"Down, down beneath the deep, That

oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a

sound and peaceful sleep, With the

salt waves dashing over him." --

Lord Byron gentlemen.

BILL

Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in

twice.  So I guess I'll be eating

your breakfast too.

MIKE

I got five bucks says he doesn't.

CHRIS

I got five that says he doesn't

live.

TOD

I'll take a dollar of that.

ROBIN

This is crazy!

CHUCK

Jesus.

ROBIN

I can't watch this.

BILL

Skipper on deck!

SKIPPER

You know what's out there?  Wind and

wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools

that'll hold a sailing ship for

weeks and then spit her out into the

eye of the kind of hurricane.  A

blow that could knock the bridge off

a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and

sandbars that'll tear the belly from

her and enough fog and night to hide

it all.

SKIPPER

So look out there... and explain to

me why any man in possession of any

sense at all, would take on the sea

with sail?

SKIPPER

Because there's something else out

there.  It beckons in the wind and

sings in the shrouds.  Voices.

Whispering...

SKIPPER

They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men

you don't even know.  Men you can't

even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,

that part of you and I that aches to

be alive, that was banished by

everything we've ever been taught or

told.  It's a part of us that can

only be found on mountain tops and

deserts, in the deepest caverns,

smoking battle fields and... across

oceans.

SKIPPER

Out there, is where it all waits.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

He was everything I had expected,

part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.

He spoke in whispers and answered

all queries with efficiency and

directness.  He had gone to sea for

the first time at fifteen, the same

age as Bill Butler.  And as he

looked upon us that first day it

must have been as though he were

staring into a mirror.

SKIPPER

(reading)

"Where we go one, we go all."

TERRY

This -- is gonna be a long eight

months.

TOD

Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs

are the first things to go once we

put out.

RICK

You know we gotta dumbwaiter for

that.

RICK

Not that one.  Tod-o here.

TOD

Har, har, har...

TERRY

I'm done.  I'm finished...

RICK

Hungry, Goodall?

JOHN

What's your problem?

ROBIN

Why'd you jump?

JOHN

Because I felt like it.

(sharp)

What do you care?

ROBIN

(aside)

I couldn't do it.

JOHN

Well, as soon as you grow some

balls, let me know.

ROBIN

Screw you!

CHARLIE

He's right.  It was a stupid stunt.

JOHN

Excuse me?

CHARLIE

You heard me.

JOHN

Don't ever call me stupid.

ROBIN

Come on, he didn't mean anything.

JOHN

Let me tell you girls something.  I

do what I wanna do.  When I wanna do

it.  And I don't give a shit what

old Ahab up there thinks either.

Any questions?

BILL

Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg,

Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:

scrape and paint.  Corry and

Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson,

you're the Galley slave.  March

you're on chain gang with Barnes.

Johnston, solo on bilge detail.

TOD

Butler, what'd I ever do to you?

BILL

You came back, Tod.  You came back.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

We were all thirteen individuals.

We'd arrived the sum total of our

limited experiences and the result

of our parents' best, if not narrow,

expectations...

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

... Some of us were there for

discipline, some for escape.  But I

could see a small piece of myself in

all of them and though I fought the

notion, for me, I knew now, this

would be home.

ANNOUNCER

"President Eisenhower today

acknowledged that a secret American

spy plane was in fact shot down over

the Soviet Union.  The pilot has

been confirmed as Francis Gary

Powers..."

TERRY

Why couldn't it have been a wooden

boat?

MIKE

Steel boats don't leak.

ROBIN

Hey, can I have one?

ROBIN

Thanks daddy-o.

TERRY

Well, don't brush too hard.  Looks

to me like the only thing holding

this bucket together is the rust.

FRANCIS (O.S.)

Ahoy there.

SKIPPER

Good afternoon.

FRANCIS

Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of

confidence.

SKIPPER

Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross

is considered a very good omen.  It

is said they embody the spirits of

sailors passed on.  It's very bad

luck if you kill one.  And dolphins

too.

FRANCIS

I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my

son, Philip.

SKIPPER

I know.

SKIPPER

You're a day late.  We keep a

schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend

on it.

(to Philip)

Hello, Philip.

PHIL

Sir.

FRANCIS

Your cable said you wouldn't be

putting out until mid-October.

SKIPPER

As you can see, there's a lot to do.

FRANCIS

Indentured servitude is not what my

son had in mind.

SKIPPER

This is a working ship.  Promptness

is not a luxury, it's a necessity,

as is the work to maintain her.  Had

we been ready, I can assure you we

would have sailed.

FRANCIS

And I would have expected

compensation for my time and expense

coming all the way down here.

SKIPPER

Happily, it all worked out... This

time.

(to Bill)

Bill, take Philip below and help him

find a bunk.

FRANCIS

I'll be frank with you.  This was

his mother's idea.  A romp through

the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds

more like a vacation than an

education if you ask me.

SKIPPER

It will be more than that, I can

promise you.

FRANCIS

(cool)

Take good care of my son.

SKIPPER

We'll do our best.  You're welcome

to say goodbye.

FRANCIS

He's a big boy.

LAWFORD

Well, that was neighborly.

SKIPPER

He didn't get to be Under Secretary

of the Air Force by being

neighborly.

SKIPPER

Everyone aboard young Bill?

BILL

Yes, Sir.

SKIPPER

Good.

(beat)

Let's go sailing.

SKIPPER

Come over here and take the wheel.

SKIPPER

Hold her steady into the wind.

Southwest by west.

CHUCK

Yes sir.

SKIPPER

(to all)

Gentleman, when you hear an order,

sing out.  I want to know that

you've heard and understand.

(quietly to Bill)

Raise the mainsail.

BILL

(calling out)

Raise the main!

TOGETHER

Raise the main!!

SKIPPER

Take a turn under the pin and lead

it out to the others.  You guys in

the rear take up the slack.  Heave

together now...

BILL

(singing)

"When the sun came up there was

whisky in the cup..."

BOYS

"When the sun came up there was

whisky in the cup..."

LAWFORD

Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt

it out like men!!

BILL

(singing)

"Not one of us was a sober..."

SKIPPER

What's wrong Mr. Lawford.

LAWFORD

It seems we're short on singers.

SKIPPER

Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer

gentlemen.  It lets everyone know

you're in sync.  It shows unity,

that all thoughts are one.  A crew

that sings together stays together.

Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and

be sailors.

JOHN

(in a whisper)

Everybody swims, everybody sings...

What's next?  Tap dancing?

LAWFORD

Tie it off!!

SKIPPER

(to Bill)

Outer.

BILL

Outer Jib!

CHARLIE

(confused)

Outta what?

SKIPPER

(to Bill)

We'll bear off to port and run down

wind.

BILL

Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the

mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib

sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim

and Dick go aloft to unstop the

forecourse.  George will show you

what to do.  Tod, show your men the

forward pinrail and stand ready on

the buntlines and clewlines.

Forecourse first... work upward.

BILL

Unstop the squares!

YARDARM CREW

Unstop the squares!!

SKIPPER

(to Chuck)

Fall off to port.  Ease her around

to a heading of northeast.  Sing out

when you're there.

CHUCK

(in a whisper)

Ah... Northeast... sir.

SKIPPER

(barking)

Speak up boy!

CHUCK

Northeast sir!

SKIPPER

Unfurl the squares!

BILL

Raise the inner jib!  Raise the

forestaysail!

SKIPPER

Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we

jibe now we'll have a lot of people

in the water.

CHUCK

Yes, sir.

SKIPPER

All stop on the engine.

BILL

All stop on the engine!

SKIPPER

Behold gentlemen.  The power of the

wind!

SKIPPER

Did we lose anybody?

ALICE

Not yet.

SKIPPER

Chart us a course for the windward

side.

ALICE

That low passed through last night.

May be a little bumpy out there.

SKIPPER

It's time these boys saw some real

blue water.

SKIPPER

Well... now that I have your

undivided attention... I'd like to

take this opportunity to make a few

points...

TERRY

(aside)

This guy is certifiable...

PHIL

Suicidal...

SKIPPER

The first thing is I don't like

people talking when I'm talking so

the two of you, shut up.

SKIPPER

Second, the next one of you who

doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr.

Butler gives an order is gonna spend

the rest of this trip scrubbing

bilges.  He's a better sailor today

than any ten of you will be when

this is all over.

SKIPPER

And if I catch anybody, ever,

jumping off a yard arm again I will

personally break what bones are left

and send you home in a wheel chair.

TERRY

We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna

die!

SKIPPER

Excellent point.  As you might have

noticed, being out here pretty much

puts you in the moment.  If you

panic, if you lose your head, you

die.  Maybe you take your mates with

you.  How'd you like to have to bet

on Terry here getting us home today?

Each one of you is responsible for

the rest.  "Where we go one, we go

all".  If your buddy is asleep at

the switch we're all fish food.

SKIPPER

The ship beneath you is not a toy

and sailing is not a game.  The

Albatross will take us far

gentlemen, but she demands constant

attention.  Respect her, and we'll

do fine.  Oh, and one more thing.

There is nothing that goes on, on

this boat that I don't know about.

She speaks to me in the night.  So

don't test me.  Not even a little.

SKIPPER

Nothing like experience to put

things in perspective.  Huh son?

(to Bill)

Alright.  Let's go home.

LAWFORD

That's not a satisfactory answer.

JOHN

Look, save it for somebody else will

ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have

anything to do with me.

LAWFORD

Shit?!!!

LAWFORD

Read for me please the words of Mr.

Keats at the bottom of the page.

ROBIN

I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.

JOHN

Shut up donut.

JOHN

(reading)

Much have I traveled in realms of

gold/ And many goodly states and

kingdoms seen/ Round many western

islands have I been/ Which bards in

fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one

wide expanse had I been told/ That

deep-browed Homer ruled as his

demesne.

LAWFORD

You know what he is talking about

here?

LAWFORD

(ranting)

Awe.  Humility.  He's telling you

that he has traveled the seas as

Homer did.  As Ulysses had before

him as he tried to find his way home

to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars.

"That deep browed Homer"...

LAWFORD

Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the

mind; "... ruled as his demesne."

He commands the voyage of the

imagination, like a god.

(pause)

That is what one of the greatest

literary minds of modern times, Mr.

Boutillier, has to say about Homer.

LAWFORD

You think the Odyssey is dull?  I'll

tell you something, it's about each

one of you -- right now.  Doubt and

expectation.  Friendship, community,

self sacrifice and accountability.

LAWFORD

This isn't just a story!!  It's

history made allegory.  It is a

philosophical handbook for life!  It

holds the secret of this very

voyage.

JOHN

What is it... the secret?

JOHN

(confused)

What?

LAWFORD

If it were only that simple, my

young friend.  Read on, gentlemen.

Read on.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

And so it was the Albatross that

took to the open sea with the wind

in her snapping canvas and a bone of

white foam in her teeth... In each

of us were feelings of anticipation

and hesitation for the man at the

wheel and of the unfamiliar world he

was leading us into.

ROBIN

Bill!!  Skipper!!

SKIPPER

You all right?

CHUCK

It was my fault.  I slipped.

SKIPPER

Why didn't you go up there?

SKIPPER

Speak up.

CHARLIE

He's afraid to climb.

SKIPPER

What?

(to Robin)

Is that true?

SKIPPER

Why wasn't I made aware of this

Bill?

BILL

I didn't know sir.

SKIPPER

It's your job to know.  If something

goes wrong up there, the other

eighteen people aboard can't be

wondering if he's gonna do his job

or not.

SKIPPER

Swing up, son.

ROBIN

(trembling)

What?

SKIPPER

Up you go.  Right now.

SKIPPER

Do you have something to say?

PHIL

(smug)

No.

SKIPPER

Then keep your mouth shut.

SKIPPER

(to Robin)

What's it going to be?

ROBIN

I'm sorry...

SKIPPER

Sorry won't cut it.

SKIPPER

Survival means discipline and

assimilation.  There are no special

cases here.

(to Robin)

Now, get going.  Get up there.

SKIPPER

What are you blubbering about?

ROBIN

I don't know...

SKIPPER

One hand in front of the other son.

We'll do it together.

SKIPPER

Don't look down.  Look in my eyes!

Climb!  We'll do it together.

ROBIN

(sobbing)

I can't.

SKIPPER

You climb damn it, or so help me

I'll haul you to the foretop by your

diaper and leave you there!

ROBIN

Aaauuuhhh!!!

SKIPPER

Are you hating this?!  Are you!

ROBIN

I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!

SKIPPER

No.  Hate the fear inside of you!

Climb like a man mister!  Hate it!

Hate it away.  Hate your way up one

more rung!!  Do it right now!!

TOGETHER

Auuuggghhh!!!!

ROBIN

Oh, god...

SKIPPER

Don't hate yourself.  Hate your

weakness.  All right.  Get down.

SKIPPER

I'm only gonna say this one time.

I'm not here to wipe noses and

asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust

funds and blue blazers don't get you

a thing out here.  You wanna act

like babies, then get off my boat.

SKIPPER

(to Chuck)

He can take care of himself.

(to others)

Any other 'phobias' I need to know

about?

PHIL

No, sir.

SKIPPER

Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers

a position to suit his condition.

SKIPPER

Remember something, sooner or

later... we all have to face it.

CHUCK

(aside)

Face what?

SKIPPER

We're awfully quiet tonight.

SKIPPER

Something on your mind, George?

GEORGE

I think you were too hard on

Weathers.

SKIPPER

You do?

GEORGE

Yes.  I do.

SKIPPER

I need to know what I'm working

with; what their boundaries are.

Their lives depend on it, and for

that matter so does yours.  We've

got to bring them together.  Make

them a crew.  We're as strong as our

weakest link and I don't want to

find that out the hard way.  So, I

will challenge them and they will

come together.

GEORGE

(sarcastic)

Yes sir.

SKIPPER

You know the best thing about being

a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's

all my responsibility.  So I'll tell

you what George, you stay off of my

bridge, and I'll stay out of your

galley.  We'll get along that way.

GEORGE

Fucking bastard.

LAWFORD

I've seen him snatch the tail of the

tempest and stuff it, screaming,

into a bottle.  The bilges are full

of them.

GEORGE

What do you mean?

LAWFORD

He's been beyond the reach.  To the

edge of the abyss and back.  He'll

do well by us all George.  He's a

real salt.  There's no malice in him

and there's nothing more dear to him

than his boys.  So sleep well my

friend.

CHUCK

How ya doing?

ROBIN

(without turning)

Fine.

CHUCK

Good.

ROBIN

Look, I appreciate, you know, the

concern and all, but like he said, I

can take care of myself.

CHUCK

I just brought you something to eat.

CHUCK

I feel like I got you into this.

ROBIN

Forget it.

CHUCK

I'm used to spending a lot of time

alone.  I guess that's what I

thought it would be out here.  But,

it's not is it?

ROBIN

(beat)

I'm sorry I left you hanging up

there.

CHUCK

It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm

just sorry you got chewed out.

ROBIN

My brother and I used to climb to

the top of this old beech tree in

the back yard and watch the moon

come up just like this.  My parents

would fight all the time so we'd

sneak out there where we couldn't

hear 'em and recite scenes from our

favorite movies.

ROBIN

Would you believe I miss it?  The

middle of paradise and I'm homesick.

CHUCK

(ironic)

Well, I wouldn't worry.  It'll all

be there when we get back.

JOHN

(disgusted)

Come on man.  Show a little

backbone!

(to Tod)

You believe that?!

CHRIS

Sorry.

LAWFORD

(to Bill)

We're gonna have nobody left up here

to crew.  Better let Skipper know.

JOHN

Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not

the only guy on this boat that can

take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of

wusses, I swear...!

JOHN

Son of a bitch!!

SKIPPER

Come in.

BILL

Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much

doing group boot over the side.

SKIPPER

Well, that's all part of it.

BILL

We've got weather moving in from the

west.

SKIPPER

That's part of it, too.

CHUCK

That a... storm, Skipper?

SKIPPER

Uh, huh.

CHUCK

Would you, um, say it's a big storm?

SKIPPER

Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

LAWFORD

What do you think?

SKIPPER

Barometer's dropping.  The first

blow'll come from the south.  Might

get interesting.

CHUCK

Shouldn't we turn away?

SKIPPER

You can't run from the wind son.

You trim your sails, face the music

and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's

close her up, dog, tight.

SKIPPER

Furl the squares, reef the main, and

bend on the storm jib, but keep it

furled.  Drop everything but the

inner jib.  I want everybody down

before we get any lightning.

GEORGE

Why's it always happen at night?

SKIPPER

George... I want hot food in

everybody.  Get to it.

ALICE

Looks like weather.

SKIPPER

Yep.

SKIPPER

Do me a favor and tell Bill once

she's dogged down I want everyone to

break out their slickers and make

sure their gear is stowed or we'll

spend the next week sorting

underwear.

(to the others)

Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil

will stand the watch.  Everyone else

hit the racks.

PHIL

(impulsively)

I'm not staying out here.

SKIPPER

No.  That's for sure.  Charlie, take

his place.

CHUCK

If it's all the same, I'd like to

stay on deck.

SKIPPER

Take the wheel.

SKIPPER

Everyone out of the rigging NOW!

BILL

Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!

TOD

(shouting)

HERE IT COMES!!

SKIPPER

Bill, on the wheel with Chuck.

TOD

We blew the inner!

ALICE

I'll go.

SKIPPER

Bring it down and run up the storm

jib.  We'll fix it later.  Stay out

of reach of the blocks!

SKIPPER

(with a twinkle)

Well, we're in it now.

ALICE

NOOO!!!

SKIPPER

(to Chuck)

Hold her steady.

ALICE

Release this when I tell you!!

ALICE

NOW!!!

SKIPPER

Be careful will ya?

JOHN

What ever you say Cap...

SKIPPER

Let's get that storm jib up.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

The storm lasted sixteen hours and

it set us all on equal footing.  It

was the first time that we shared an

episode on an even plane.  As we

stood our watches we were equally

out of control of our situation,

regardless of our physical abilities

or social backgrounds.  And though

our real feelings lay hidden beneath

bravado and defiance, we were no

longer strangers.

LAWFORD

You know what they say in the Navy

don't you?

RICK

What's that, Big Daddy?

LAWFORD

"If it moves, salute it.  If it

doesn't move, pick it up.  If it's

too big to pick up, paint it!"

MIKE

Ladies, gentlemen and

hermaphrodites, Mr. Corry and I are

happy to announce the grand opening

of Trans-Border Enterprises.

CHRIS

All of the creature comforts and

vices you could possibly want, at

home or abroad, available twenty-

four hours a day.

MIKE

For a price, of course.

ROBIN

If you've got "a broad" available

I'll take her.

JOHN

Like you'd know what to do with one.

TERRY

You got Marlboro's?

CHRIS

Absa-fuckin-lutely.

CHUCK

Toss me a Cola.

CHRIS

Fifty cents.

CHUCK

What?!!

MIKE

Contraband's hard to come by out

here son.

PHIL

Hey Goodall, you got a date or

something?

JOHN

Yeah.  With your mom.

EVERYBODY

Oooooooo.

CHRIS

We also have a few rental items...

MIKE

There's a penalty for any material

returned to the Trans-Border Library

with sticky pages.

MIKE

Hey, you can't do that!!

(to Chris)

He can't do that!!

CHRIS

Sure he can.

CHUCK

Come on you guys, this isn't funny!

CHARLIE

Come on Chucky.  Show us a little

grit.

CHUCK

YEEE HAAAA!!!!!

CHARLIE

Okay, who's next?

PHIL

You gotta be kidding?  He's a human

chum line!

RICK

No self respecting shark is gonna

take a bite out of you.

TERRY

I'm next!

TOD

There she blows!!

SKIPPER

Get him in.

BILL

Come on in!!!

SKIPPER

Do it now Bill.

TERRY

Get me out!!!  Get me out!!!

MIKE

Oh my god!!  It's a...

SKIPPER

(calmly)

Shark.

(to Robin)

Don't lose it son.

GEORGE

Keep it coming.

CHARLIE

Whoops.

TERRY

Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!!

GEORGE

He must be two hundred pounds!

Bring him in close and try to hold

him steady.

GEORGE

Got him!

RICK

Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister

Mary Anne's butt.

SKIPPER

Well, now you have something to

write home about.

TOM

Land ho!!!  Land ho!!!

GEORGE

Shit.

ROBIN

There's more where that came from.

ALICE

Cheated death again.

SKIPPER

Yep.

ROBIN

What do you say?  Cokes?  I'm

buying.

CHUCK & JOHN

Sure.

ROBIN

You're right Chuck.  There's nothing

quite as refreshing as a cold ten

cent Coke that only costs ten cents!

ROBIN

You think Skipper and Alice do it?

CHUCK

Do what?

ROBIN

Ya know... "It".

CHUCK

That's like wondering if your mom

and dad do it.  Who wants to know?

JOHN

She isn't that old.

CHUCK

What do you mean?

JOHN

I mean she looks pretty damn good in

her all-together for being thirty.

ROBIN

How would you know?

JOHN

Trust me donut.  I know.

ROBIN

What?  Come on...

JOHN

On the dog watch, night after the

storm, I look down into the skylight

above Skipper's cabin and there she

was, peelin' down.

CHUCK

No way!

ROBIN

Come on man, what'd they look like?

JOHN

Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like

a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

ROBIN

I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

CHUCK

I walked in on my parents one time.

It was only like eight o'clock and

they were in bed and I thought that

was kinda weird so I just walked in.

JOHN

That's what they get for not locking

the door.

CHUCK

So I'm standing there and you could

hear a pin drop.  No breathing or

snoring... Suddenly it hits me that

somethin' was goin' on that just

stopped, really fast, like people

are holding their breath.

ROBIN

So... What happened?

CHUCK

My mother says in this really low,

but very awake kind of voice "What?"

ROBIN

What'd you do?

CHUCK

I said "Sorry, wrong room" and

walked away.

JOHN

Did you shut the door at least?

CHUCK

I don't remember.

ROBIN

My parents don't do it anymore.

CHUCK

How do you know?  They might.

ROBIN

'Cause they're getting a divorce.

(beat)

That's why they sent me here.  My

sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted

us out of the house so they could

get down to business.

JOHN

They tell you that?

ROBIN

I figured it out.

CHUCK

Yeah.

JOHN

My old man split along time ago.  It

doesn't mean anything.  You just

take care of number one that's all

that matters.

ROBIN

It matters to me.

JOHN

(kindly)

Okay donut.  Whatever you say.

CHUCK

We better get back.

ROBIN

Did you really see 'em.

SKIPPER

It's a good sail boys.

TOD

Thank you, sir.  Shall we trim the

main Skipper?  I think we could get

another knot or two.

SKIPPER

As you like.

PHIL

What do you say I have a crack at

the wheel?

TOD

I'd say, fuck off junior.

TOD

Jesus Christ!!  Let it out.  Let it

out!!

SKIPPER

Hard to port!  Hard to port!!

SKIPPER

Start the engine.  All ahead full!!

Scallop the Square and drop the

rest!!

TOD

(bewildered)

I don't know what happened Skipper.

It just blew out.

ROBIN

Where are you from any way?

CHUCK

Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout

you?

ROBIN

Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom

capital of the world'.

TOD

Sorry to here it.

CHUCK

Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya

know?  Bein' here together an all...

PHIL

Christ, I'm gonna choke on 'feel

good'...

TOD

Why are you such a penis Phil.  Do

you do it on purpose or can't you

help it.

PHIL

Tug my chain Johnstone.

SKIPPER

After midterms we'll finish our run

down to Curacao.

SKIPPER

I have arranged to host a good will

cruise for the Dutch students of the

local school there.

PHIL

(to Terry)

Joy, rapture...

SKIPPER

Each one of you will be responsible

for one student.  I'll expect you to

be courteous.  You represent this

school and your country.  We'll sail

in the morning.

GEORGE

That's chow.

RICK

Hey man, wake up.  Wake up!

ROBIN

I was falling...

PHIL

Hey, shut up will ya?

CHUCK

It was a bad dream...

ROBIN

It was so real...

CHUCK

Here's the thing; whenever you're

having a nightmare, all you have to

do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be

out of it.  You'll wake up.

ROBIN

Who told you that?

CHUCK

My dad.

ROBIN

It works?

CHUCK

Swear to God.  Only good advice he

ever gave me.  Now, go back to

sleep.

CHUCK

(lingering)

You okay now?

ROBIN

That's how he died you know.

CHUCK

Who?

ROBIN

My brother.  He fell out of the old

beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was

on a camp out.  They started going

at it, throwin' things, a real knock

down...

(beat)

They didn't find him 'till the next

morning.  They didn't even know why

he was up there.

CHUCK

Jesus, you never told them?

ROBIN

I couldn't.

MIKE

(hushed)

Hey you guys, come on!

PHIL (O.S.)

What do you think you're doing?

PHIL

Forget it.  Count me out!

GEORGE

(bolting up)

What?!  What's happening?!!

SKIPPER

You're officer of the watch, George.

GEORGE

I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned

book.  Lawford gave it to me.

GEORGE

Son-of-a-bitch.

SKIPPER

We're short one long boat too.  Come

on.

RICK

Oh I was walkin' down Lime street

one day...

ALL

Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...

RICK

A pretty young maiden she happened

my way...

ALL

Give me some time to blow the man

down...

SKIPPER

I guess we know what the next

acquisition for the galley is going

to be...

GEORGE

What's that?

SKIPPER

A padlock.

RICK

So to all you sailors who've fought

wind and whale...

ALL

Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...

RICK

She said "None the better, you all

go to hell..."

ALL

Give me some time to Blow the man

down!

CHRIS

I only have one question.

JOHN

What's that, Canuck?

CHRIS

If we're not on the boat, how come

the ground is moving?

CHUCK

You think George'll miss the bottle?

TERRY

We'll blame it on Big Daddy.  He's a

lush.

MIKE

All I know is if that Viking son of

a bitch puts me on smegma duty one

more time I'm gonna have to run him

through.

TERRY

(mimicking)

The "Old Man" likes a tight ship!

CHARLIE

"If it moves, shoot it..."

CHUCK

"If it doesn't move, throw it

overboard.  If it's too big to throw

overboard, screw it!"

RICK

You think Old Thunder Nuts will

figure out that we're A.W.O.L.

PHIL

"There is nothing that goes on, on

this boat that I don't know about.

She speaks to me in the night.  So

don't test me.  Not even a

little..."

GEORGE

Immortality.

SKIPPER

Spirits have a way of bringing that

out.

GEORGE

And being sixteen.

SKIPPER

They're in a hurry to grow up.  They

don't know about consequences or

responsibility.  That's being

sixteen too.

(beat)

I promise you one thing...

GEORGE

What's that?

SKIPPER

They'll know about it in the

morning.

ROBIN

(alarmed)

Jesus H. Christ.

TERRY

What now pork chop?

ROBIN

Look!

TERRY

Holy shit!  Where'd she go?

CHARLIE

What the hell is going on?

MIKE

She's gone!  The boat's gone!!

PHIL

Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we

shouldn't have gone.  I tried to

tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You

guys made me come!  You made me

come!!

JOHN

Will you shut up?  You sound like my

fucking sister.

CHUCK

Alright.  Everybody just stay cool.

We'll figure this out.

MIKE

Who the hell checked the mooring?

ROBIN

I did.  Why?

CHARLIE

Maybe she pulled free...

MIKE

What if they don't know.  If she's

adrift, if they're asleep, she could

run aground.  She could break up on

the reef.

PHIL

(to Robin)

Maybe you didn't check it good

enough.

ROBIN

(defensive,

frightened)

I did.  I swear.

PHIL

Yeah, well you're really gonna have

some bad dreams if we find out you

didn't.

JOHN

That's enough.

PHIL

How the hell are we gonna get outta

here?

JOHN

We'll think of something.

PHIL

Oh, praise the lord.

(announcing)

Relax everybody.  Everything is

under control.  The jug head's going

to think of something.

JOHN

Nobody calls me an idiot.

PHIL

God damn it man.  I think he broke

my nose!

CHUCK

Shut up, Phil.

TERRY

Well that's just great.  Now what

are we supposed to do?

RICK

Oh-my-god...

ROBIN

I'm not sure if this is really good

or really bad.

GEORGE

I got a live one!

SKIPPER

The thing about fishing George, is

you need to let 'em run some.  Give

'em just enough slack so they don't

break the line.  But at the same

time you've gotta keep enough

tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em

in slowly so they don't really know

they're hooked.

GEORGE

I'll try and remember that.

SKIPPER

You know what a loose cannon is?

'Bout the worst thing that could

happen to a wooden ship.  All it

took was one, crashing around the

deck in a storm... It'd smash

everything in its way, maybe take

out a mast or punch a hole right

through the hull.  Think about it,

just one cannon not tied down, not

anchored, could take a whole 'Man of

War' straight to the bottom.

MIKE

(aside)

But we don't have any cannons?

CHRIS

(hushed)

Shut up!

SKIPPER

Now, if the Skipper were smart, if

he could see a storm building, why

he'd cut loose every gun on his

boat.  Even though it would leave

him at a disadvantage in battle,

he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better

chance running for port than risk

the entire ship, his crew.

SKIPPER

People are like that sometimes.

They cut loose and before you know

it, they're knocking holes in

everything.  So you gotta ask

yourself if it might not be better

to just put 'em off before they sink

the whole thing.  I mean after all,

you can always get new cannons.

SKIPPER

(beat)

I want a tight ship, everybody

shaved and in clean clothes when we

make Curacao.  If it goes well, if

your mid terms are acceptable, I may

reconsider my decision about the

rest of the trip.  That's all.

CHUCK

Where you going?

JOHN

To take a piss.

ROBIN

Really?

JOHN

Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come

in and shake it for me?

CHUCK

If you're gonna cheat, you might as

well copy off somebody who's gonna

get the answer right.

JOHN

You've gotta be kidding.  Get the

fuck outta my way!

JOHN

What the hell!!!

CHUCK

Takin' a piss?

ROBIN

Why, man?

JOHN

I don't have to listen to this.

CHUCK

Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you

don't, I'm gonna go right up there

and have a heart to heart with

Skipper and you'll be on the first

plane back to idiotville.

ROBIN

Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's

the matter with you?  If Phil had

caught you he'd have ratted you out

in a second.  You get caught

cheating, you'll get kicked off the

boat.

JOHN

I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All

right?!

CHUCK

What?

JOHN

I doctored my grades so I'd make the

cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You

satisfied?!

CHUCK

You're not a moron.

JOHN

Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to

get through one chapter of Lawford

and I still don't have any idea what

the hell he's talkin' about.  You

know why it takes me so long to

write papers?  because I can't

spell.  While everybody else is

sleeping, I'm in the rack with a

flashlight and a dictionary.

JOHN

Hell, they even kicked me outa vo-

tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide

rule.

PHIL

I can show you how to use a slide

rule.

ROBIN

How long you been standing there?

PHIL

Long enough.

JOHN

They were gonna put me into special-

ed this year.  I stole a copy of my

transcript, changed all the grades.

Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never

pass the boards.

CHUCK

Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll

make sure you get the grades.  We'll

start a private study group.  Nobody

knows.  You'll ace that test.

ROBIN

I'm in.

PHIL

Me, too.

JOHN

Why would you do that?

CHUCK

Because we believe in you.

(beat)

Because we're your friends.

CHUCK

What are they doing?

ROBIN

I can't make it out?

ROBIN

Hey, Phil... Swing up the 'binocs'

and tell us what you see.

PHIL

(puzzled)

They're waving... handkerchiefs or

something.

RICK

What?

CHARLIE

Maybe they're surrendering.

PHIL

Wait a second...

PHIL

They're girls!  They're all girls!

TOD

Gimme those.

TOD

WHHOOOOAAAAA!!!!!!  WOMEN!!!

BILL

Good morning, ladies.

ROBIN

What are we supposed to talk about?

PHIL

You've gotta be kidding?

ROBIN

But, they don't speak English.

PHIL

There are some things that everybody

does in the same language.

CHUCK

Yeah, but how are you supposed to

make the first move?

PHIL

Like this!

PHIL

Yeeee Haaaaa!!

SKIPPER

A very enthusiastic welcome.

MS. BOYDE

We don't often have guests.  Our

girls have been looking forward to

your visit for some time.  Welcome

to Curacao.

SKIPPER

Thank you.  You're all ready to sail

then?

MS. BOYDE

I should think so.

ALICE

I'm sure they won't be disappointed.

FRANCIS (O.S.)

Ahoy there!!

PEGGY

Surprise!

FRANCIS

Well, well.  What do we have here?

A floating brothel?

ALICE

(cool)

Hardly.

FRANCIS

Well, we thought we'd drop in and

see if you were all still in one

piece.

SKIPPER

(pointed)

And, of course, we are.

FRANCIS

Well, you never can tell these days,

can you?

SKIPPER

What is it we can do for you today?

FRANCIS

Well, we've come to give our boy a

little break from the monotony.

PHIL

It's not monotonous.

FRANCIS

Never the less...

FRANCIS

Hop to boy.  We haven't got all day.

SKIPPER

I didn't know, Phil.

CREW TOGETHER

When the sun came up there was

whisky in the cup/ and not one of us

was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a

picture, but it really was the sun/

then we knew the party was over...

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

Curacao seemed out of a dream,

somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio

drew further and further away, it

was home that began to seem unreal,

drifting somewhere in the foggy

reaches of our memories.  And I knew

that each of us was falling in love.

But not only with these wonderful

women or the swaying palms and

porcelain beaches... We were falling

in love with the experience we were

sharing, and with who we were

becoming.

CHUCK

Bregitta.  Do you believe it?

JOHN

Believe what?

CHUCK

Her name.

(savoring the sound)

Bregitta.  It's poetry.

TERRY

Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".

TOD

Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're

talking to a guy whose idea of big

romance is a palm full of Vaseline.

TERRY

Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't

seen you swapping spit with anybody.

TOD

That's because I'm discrete, moron.

SKIPPER

Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the

tide.  Twenty-three hundred.  Sharp.

I'm not waiting.  Have a good time

tonight but be back on time.

LAWFORD

Hold this, will ya?

LAWFORD

Madam, I would consider it a

privilege if you would allow me to

take you on a tour of the dance

floor.

LAWFORD

You're very light on your feet Ms.

Boyde.  Was it you who taught all of

these young ladies the art of the

dance?

FRANCIS

What's wrong, you don't like steak?

PHIL

I should be eating with the crew.

FRANCIS

Humor me.  Eat it anyway.

PHIL

Why are you here?

PEGGY

We missed you.  We wanted to check

on you.

PHIL

I don't need you spying on me.

FRANCIS

Spying?!

PHIL

I can take care of myself.

FRANCIS

(sarcastic)

Oh, really?

PHIL

Look, you put me on this boat in the

first place.  I didn't want to come

but I did.  Why do you have to

embarrass me.  Why can't you just

leave me alone?

PEGGY

Francis!!

FRANCIS

Listen to me, you thankless little

prick.  We're your parents, so don't

you dare talk to me disrespectfully.

What the hell is it, this captain?

Because I'll see him in a rowboat...

PHIL

It has nothing to do with him.

FRANCIS

Well, what does it have to do with?

Us?

PHIL

No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it

just be about me?  For once?

SKIPPER

He would have loved this.

ALICE

Your father?

SKIPPER

All his years at sea, he never

stopped talking about these islands.

ALICE

You miss him.

SKIPPER

Every hour.  Every minute.

(pause)

I wish he was here.  I wish he could

have sailed our girl.  Seen these

boys...

SKIPPER

I'd have liked to have said goodbye.

ALICE

He knows.

SKIPPER

You sound so sure.

ALICE

I am about this.

ALICE

What?

SKIPPER

He never would have believed a woman

like you existed.

ALICE

Do you remember the last time you

and I danced under the stars?

SKIPPER

Guilty.

ALICE

On the deck of the Yankee, the night

you asked me to marry you.  We

weren't much older than they are.

SKIPPER

Would you allow me?

GEORGE

If I didn't know better I'd say the

old man was acting almost halfway

human.

LAWFORD

He is halfway human.

CHUCK

I can't remember feeling like this

about myself, a place, someone like

you.  We've come such a long way,

seen so much.  But nothing like this.

CHUCK

I'm not the best at expressing

myself.  Maybe the only reason I can

now is because I know you don't

understand me.

(beat)

I like you so much.  Too much.  But

how could I?  I mean, if we can't

even communicate, how could I know

you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an

hour and I'll never see you again.

BREGITTA

I like you, too.

BREGITTA

Come on.  We don't have much time.

ROBIN

(defensive)

What?

ROBIN

(to girl)

Wait for me okay.  I'll be right

back.  I swear.

ROBIN

Phil.  What are you doing?

PHIL

Fandango, Junior.

(he holds up his

stick)

I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

ROBIN

No way Phil.  Not like this.

PHIL

Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker

down the pipe...

PHIL

It's outta here!

ROBIN

Come on man.  Let's just talk about

it.

ROBIN

Phil!  Wait man... Come on...

JOHN

(to Lawford)

Be right back.

JOHN

Jesus!  What the hell happened to

him.

PHIL

Lemme go!  Lemme go!!

ROBIN

I don't know.  We gotta get 'im

outta here before Skipper sees him

like this.

PHIL

Son of a bitch!!

JOHN

Phil, if you don't calm down, I'm

gonna hurt you.  Got it?

LAWFORD

The rust won't wait for you to read

Conrad, Goodall.

JOHN

Then he shouldn't have written such

a long poem, Mr. Lawford.

LAWFORD

Read on, young John.  Read on.

College boards are coming.

TOD

There they blow!!  There they blow!!

Dolphins off the bow!!!

CHRIS

Jesus Christ!

PHIL

Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.

RICK

No, Phil.  It's a mammal.

SKIPPER

(quietly)

Bill, lower a long boat.  We'll

bring her up with the davit.

SKIPPER

What do you think?

ALICE

It's through her lung.

SKIPPER

(to Phil)

Nice shot.

SKIPPER

Finish it.

PHIL

(stammering)

I'm not gonna kill it.

SKIPPER

You already have.  Now go on.  Do

it.

SKIPPER

What the hell is wrong with you?!

SKIPPER

Come on.  You got so much fight in

you; you wanna kill something?  Take

your best shot.  The first one's

free.

SKIPPER

That's what I thought.

(beat)

You're done.  You're going home.

PHIL

You mean-assed bastard!!  You son of

a bitch!!  You can't do this!!!  You

can't do this!!!  God damn you!!

God damn you!!

CHUCK

Why'd you do it?

PHIL

(regretting it)

What's the difference?

CHUCK

You only hurt yourself you know?

PHIL

Like you really care.  Like any of

you give a shit what happens to me.

RICK

You're the one who doesn't care,

Phil.

PHIL

It hurts too much to care.

RICK

About yourself?

PHIL

About anything.

ROBIN

We shouldn't be putting him off the

boat.

CHRIS

The guy's out of control.

ROBIN

Everybody's been outta control on

this trip.

(beat)

Are we a crew or not?  I mean, isn't

that what this is supposed to be all

about?

MIKE

You're the last person who should be

whining about being a "crew".

ROBIN

How do you figure that?

MIKE

Well, I'd sure like to go into the

subject of vertigo and all, but I

wouldn't want you to piss yourself.

JOHN

You're a regular prick you know

that?

MIKE

Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall.

JOHN

Everybody deserves a second chance,

ya know?  We'd do the same for you

Mike.

ROBIN

It's about family isn't it?  I mean

are we together on this or not?

MIKE

Hell, do what ever you want.  It

won't change anything anyway.

ROBIN

I can't go in there.

CHUCK

What are you talking about.

ROBIN

The guys were right.  It'll mean

nothing coming from me.  He'll

listen to you Chuck.  Everybody

does.

SKIPPER

Come.

SKIPPER

What's on your mind?

CHUCK

I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.

SKIPPER

Well, spit it out.

CHUCK

The fact is... We'd like you to give

Phil another chance.

SKIPPER

Can't do it.

CHUCK

Sir...?

SKIPPER

Close the door.  Sit down.

SKIPPER

Why do you think I'm sending him

home?

CHUCK

He killed the dolphin.

SKIPPER

The Dolphin was a symptom.

CHUCK

Of what?

SKIPPER

Of a fight he can't win out here.

CHUCK

It's his father sir.  He's

suffocating him.  We've all seen

it...

CHUCK

I mean he has all these expectations

and he doesn't even know who his own

kid is.  What right did then have to

show up here?

SKIPPER

They have every right Chuck.

CHUCK

They send us because they want us to

change, or grow up or something and

then they try to keep us the same.

SKIPPER

Let me tell you something about

Phil's father, and your's too.  How

do you think you got here?  You

think this is all free, that they

owe you something?  You think they

enjoy riding subways and commuter

trains, driving buses or pulling

lobster traps?  Work fifty weeks a

year to keep you in tennis shoes and

private school?  Look around at how

the rest of the world lives Chuck.

We're the luckiest people alive,

every one of us.  They gave it up

for you and Phil, and me too my

friend.

SKIPPER

There are ground rules in families

just like on this boat.  If you and

Phil don't like it, I'm sorry.

Someday you'll understand that, and

if you're lucky, you'll come home

and find your best friend has been

there all along waiting for you to

forgive him for being a father.

It'll be the way it used to be,

when you were ten and your dad was a

giant.

SKIPPER

Does Phil know how you guys feel?

CHUCK

I don't know.

SKIPPER

You should tell him.  That's

something he can take with him.

SKIPPER

I'm all ears.

ALICE

You may not like what you hear.

SKIPPER

I can take it.

ALICE

They've become what you wanted.

They're a crew.  That's why he came.

SKIPPER

Why did we begin this?

ALICE

We were idealists.

SKIPPER

Because we believed we could make an

impact out here.  Self reliance and

community through the disciplines of

sailing.

ALICE

I haven't forgotten.

SKIPPER

Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's

just striking out at the world.

ALICE

He has a lot of hurt inside him.

SKIPPER

Well, he better learn to own it.

Actions have consequences.

(beat)

It's not what happens here Alice,

it's what they take away with them.

ALICE

You're still an idealist.

SKIPPER

Oh hell...

RICK

Good luck.

PHIL

I'm ready.

CHARLIE

His ol' man's gonna eat him for

lunch.

JOHN

I know what that's like.

RICK

Yeah.

CHUCK

My god...

PHIL

I'm sorry.

SKIPPER

I know, Phil.

SKIPPER

They never gave up on you, you know.

PHIL

Tell 'em I said... thanks.

(beat)

Goodbye Skipper.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

As Robin rang him out, we waved in

silent protest against Skipper's

decision.  And in the days that

followed the low morale was matched

only by a sense of arrogance that

perhaps the master should step down

and let his students take over.

TOD

Listen man, I think I have a

problem.

CHUCK

We all have problems.

TOD

I'm pissin' fire man.

ALICE

Have a nice time in Curacao, did you

Tod?

ALICE

Not so fast.

CHRIS

Way-ta-go Valentino.  I never even

copped a feel in Curacao.

TOD

Yeah well, your sexual orientation

is not my problem.

RICK

Man, is there a social disease you

haven't had?

CHARLIE

So much for vestal virgins.

LAWFORD

What do you make of that?

SKIPPER

I don't know.

GEORGE

Jesus.  She's got guns.

SKIPPER

She's Cuban.

SKIPPER

(shouting)

GET DOWN!  EVERYBODY DOWN!!

SKIPPER

Jesus, we're Americans!!!  We're

Americans!!!

TERRY

Jesus, they're gonna sink us!!

SKIPPER

Bill drop everything.  Do it now!

SKIPPER

(hitting each word)

Who the hell do they think they are?

GEORGE

They want us to identify ourselves.

SKIPPER

Tell them we're the American School

Ship, Albatross.

GEORGE

They think we're carrying Cuban

refugees.

(beat)

Skipper, they mean to board us.

SKIPPER

Not a chance.  Remind them that

according to the Geneva Convention,

firing on a civilian vessel on the

high sea is an act of war.

GEORGE

They say they are acting on the

direct authority of Fidel Castro.

SKIPPER

Tell 'em to come aboard.

SKIPPER

(to crew)

We've come a long way gentlemen.

But this is no time for heroes.  I

know you're much more, but I need you

to be boys right now.  That's an

order.  Now scatter and find your

passports.

BILL

What's wrong?

LAWFORD

We've got a problem.

SKIPPER

What's that?

LAWFORD

Terry left his passport in Curacao.

We could hide him...

SKIPPER

No.  Bring him on deck with the

others.

COMMANDER

Chicken is a fool's game captain.

SKIPPER

So is violating international law.

COMMANDER

But you invited is aboard.

SKIPPER

Your cannons made a compelling

argument.

COMMANDER

Stow away?

SKIPPER

He left his passport in Curacao.

It's being mailed to Panama.

COMMANDER

That is unfortunate.  We'll have to

take him with us.

LAWFORD

If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a

dress.

SKIPPER

Nobody aboard my ship is going

anywhere.

COMMANDER

Perhaps in appreciation for our

country's pursuit of peace, you

might offer us some, token of

gratitude.

SKIPPER

What do you want?

COMMANDER

This.  And...

COMMANDER

... and that.

GEORGE

You've got to be kidding!!

SKIPPER

(cold)

Take it.

SKIPPER

Now, get the hell off my ship.

COMMANDER

You'll really have something to

teach your students now.

SKIPPER

Las estrellas es lo unico, que un

marinero verdadero se mesesita para

encontrarse.  Verdade Patron?

CHUCK

What'd he say?

GEORGE

He told them real sailors need only

the stars.

SKIPPER

Alright then, let's get outta here.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

With staff and string he showed us

how to build a sextant.  As we rode

the trades, he shared the ancient

secrets of how to read the waves and

follow stars.  And some mornings

later, bathed in the orange glow of

a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea

like a phoenix.

NEPTUNE

Hold fast that polliwog and make him

presentable.

NEPTUNE

Let it be known that on this day in

the year nineteen hundred and sixty-

one there appeared within the limits

of my royal kingdom, the sailing

ship brigantine Albatross, bound for

Galapagos.  All vessels that sail my

domain shall be subject to the

scrutiny of the underworld...

NEPTUNE

Silence!!!

NEPTUNE

Tonight you shall all enter the

Order of the Shellbacks.  Only when

you have been duly initiated shall

you enjoy the mysteries and

protection of the trident.  So, let

the festivities begin...

ALL

Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!

Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!

Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!

NEPTUNE

By virtue of the power inherited by

me, I do hereby command all of my

subjects, such as mermaids, sea

serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks

and turtles, from eating, playing

with, or otherwise molesting this

vessel or her crew.  Let it be

remembered that on this, my

Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88'

20' 13" on this 532nd in the year of

the dolphin, you entered the Order

of the Shellbacks!!

SKIPPER

Land ho!

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

We had journeyed over six thousand

miles to the very edge of the earth.

Like Darwin before us, we would

witness the bliss of nature in the

absence of man.  And it was as if

the Albatross had forded time,

leaving it behind.  In the heat of

those equatorial days, on the virgin

onyx beaches and shifting coral

dunes, one could expect to find

sunning iguanas, nesting frigates

and perchance... the footprints of

God.

RICK

We're here for the night.

TOD

Yeah.

ALICE

What are they doing?

SKIPPER

Claiming their place in the world.

ALICE

Well gentlemen, I have the results

of your college board scores.  I

think most of you will be pleased.

CHUCK

You okay?

JOHN

Yeah.  How'd you do.

CHUCK

Ninety-six.

JOHN

Congratulations.

CHUCK

What about you?

CHUCK

It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!

JOHN

I know.

CHUCK

(excited)

You know?  Then why are you up here

looking like you're about to jump

overboard?!

JOHN

I just can't believe it.

CHUCK

This is your moment, don't you see?

The instant when you know that your

life is never going to be the same

again.  When you stand up and are

counted.

JOHN

I couldn't have done it without you.

CHUCK

Yes you could.  You did.

(holding up the

exam)

This is all you.  Nobody else.

JOHN

Thank you.

CHUCK

Feels different doesn't it?

JOHN

What?

CHUCK

That we're going back.  I don't want

it to end.  I don't want to be what

I was when I left.

JOHN

What was that?

CHUCK

Anonymous.

CHUCK

I've been getting ninety-sixes my

whole life.  It's what they expect.

After all this, I still haven't

figured it out.

JOHN

Figured what out?

CHUCK

Who I am, outside of this boat.

What the hell I'm doing here.

JOHN

I'll tell you who you are.  You're

the glue.  You're the thing that

holds everybody around you together.

You're strong, you listen and you

see things in people the rest of us

can't.  It's a gift.

CHUCK

You know, I never had friends like

this.

JOHN

Me either.

CHUCK

I feel like... we can do anything.

JOHN

We can.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

In the fading hours of that Pacific

dusk, with nothing left to confess,

for the first time we felt safe,

capable, sure of who we were and

where we were going.

LAWFORD

A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A

wind that follows fast, And fills

the white and rushing sail, And

bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise

you salty dogs.  The watch is on.

CHUCK

Looks like we're gonna get wet.

BILL

Well, we need it.  I want to take a

nice long bath and catch some water

for my laundry.

JOHN

Save some for me will you?

BILL

You got it.  I'm going below.

TOD

Jesus!!

SKIPPER

Everybody okay?

SKIPPER

All hands keep out of the rigging

and stay clear of the masts.

SKIPPER

All right gentlemen.  Thor's had his

fun.  Let's keep a keen eye.

SKIPPER

(sharply)

No!  Stay down!!

JOHN

(shouting)

HERE IT COMES!!!

SKIPPER

(in a whisper)

White Squall!

SKIPPER

Hard to starboard!!!  Hard to

starboard!!!

TOD

No, hard to port!

SKIPPER

TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE

RIGHT!!!

BILL

Get out!!  Everybody out!!

LAWFORD

GO, GO, GO!!!  TOPSIDE!!!  Come on

Charlie!  George, get them out!!

CHUCK

My God, they're drowning!

SKIPPER

Oh please, no.  Not this woman.

SKIPPER

Alice, get up!!  Come on girl!!

SKIPPER

Get out!!  Get out!!  Jesus Christ,

please God, Alice get out!!!

RICK

Bill, you go.  We'll be right behind

you.

SKIPPER

Johnny, it's not good.

JOHN

I can get it!

LAWFORD

My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!

CHUCK

OH GOD!!!!!

SKIPPER

Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north-

east.  Keep a sharp look out for

Florida.

BILL

Maybe we could wait around a little

longer, sir...

SKIPPER

(quietly)

She's gone... She's gone.

SKIPPER

Carry on.

BILL

Yes sir.

SKIPPER

North, north-east.

(beat)

And Dick, please make a note of our

final position.

LAWFORD

Hands and feet inside the boats.

CHUCK

AAAAHHHH!!!!

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

We slashed at the sharks as if

striking out at the finger of God.

And we all begged silently for the

ability to understand what had

happened.  But, if there was a God

that day, his answer came only in

the moaning wind and our questions

were left to drift unanswered, in

the titanic ocean of our deepest

grief.

CHUCK

(hushed)

Wake up.  Wake up.  1-2-3 wake up.

CHUCK

(tentative)

Skipper?

SKIPPER

I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.

MAN

What about the manifest!!  What

about my son!!!

WOMAN

How many made it?  Nobody will tell

us anything!!

OFFICER

We don't have a list of survivors

yet.  Please stand back.  Don't

push!

SKIPPER

Thank you.

FRANCIS

(above the shouting)

Welcome home.

CHARLIE

Phil?

REPORTER #1

(shouting)

What the hell happened out there

captain?

REPORTER #2

How many boys did you lose...?  And

how come you didn't go down with

your ship?

TOD

(panicked)

Charlie!!  Bill!!

TERRY'S MOTHER

Oh, sweetheart!  Look at you...

TERRY

Skipper!!

REPORTER #3

Captain, is it true that the ship was

hit by a "White Squall"?

REPORTER #2

Is it true the first mate is only

fifteen?

BILL

It wasn't his fault mister...

REPORTER #4

The National Weather Service says

"White Squalls" are a meteorological

phenomenon of the imagination.

Would you care to comment of that?

Don't you have anything to say to

these parents?!!

SKIPPER

Yes I do.  And it's private.  Very

private.

OFFICER

Sit down Captain.  We'll have a car

here in a few minutes.  Can I get

you a cup of coffee?

SKIPPER

No, thank you.

CHARLES

Chuck!  Chuck!!!

CHUCK

Dad!

CHUCK

Where's Mom?

CHARLES

I couldn't bring her down here until

I knew you were safe.

REPORTER #5

Was it the Skipper's fault?  And is

it true drinking was permitted on

board?  Why did the ship really go

down?

CHARLES

Come on.

CHARLES

I thought we'd find a store, get you

fixed up and then get you some

lunch.  That sound good?

CHUCK

Yeah, sure.

CHARLES

I'm sorry, son.  Are you okay?

CHARLES

Why don't you go and try some of

that on?

CHUCK

Okay.

CHARLES

How're you doing in there?

CHUCK (O.S.)

Fine.

CHARLES

All right.  I'm gonna wander over

and look at some shoes...

CHUCK

(calling out)

Okay.

CHUCK

Oh God...

MAN

You okay, kid?

CHARLES

Chuck!!

CHUCK

When we were growing up I always

felt like you would take care of

things, that everything would be

okay.

(beat)

But you can't make this okay, can

you?

CHARLES

No, I can't.

TYLER

There are allegations questioning

your competence with regard to the

command of the Albatross.  I have

been instructed to convene a formal

tribunal to determine whether or not

negligence played a part in the

sinking.

SKIPPER

I understand.

TYLER

May I ask you something?

TYLER

How'd you manage to piss off a guy

as powerful as Francis Boutillier?

SKIPPER

It wasn't hard.

TYLER

I used to helm a school ship.  A

long time ago.

SKIPPER

The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never

lost a race while you were Skipper.

TYLER

That's right, we didn't.  I miss it

sometimes.  But, there are other

things a Skipper can do.

TYLER

The families... want your ticket.

Turn it in, we forget the whole

thing.  Everybody goes home.

SKIPPER

... Absolutely not.

TYLER

The papers are going to eat you

alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll

never get another commission.

(beat)

They want someone to be accountable.

SKIPPER

I am accountable.

CHARLIE

We gotta talk.

BILL

We're all going to have to testify.

They're going to try to take his

license.

TOM

Why?

CHUCK

They need it to be simple.  They

need a reason.

TOM

Who?

CHUCK

All of them.  Everybody waiting on

that dock.

TIM

So what are we supposed to do?

TOD

Just tell 'em what we know and be

done with it.  That's what he'd

want.

TERRY

Easy for you to say.

TOD

What's that supposed to mean?!

TERRY

Everybody knows why she went over

Tod.  You jibed the boat.

TOD

I was trying to get her up wind!

That's what you do when you're hit

a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid

to know that!

TERRY

That's not what Skipper thought.  He

was trying to spill air from the

main!

BILL

It was coming four points off the

bow, Terry.  He never could have

gotten her around.

TERRY

Were you on deck?  I was standing

right there and all I know is, he...

(indicates Tod)

... disobeyed an order, twice, and

the boat went over.

TOD

It didn't go over 'til I turned her

starboard!

BILL

It was an act of God for Christ's

sake.

TERRY

It was an act of stupidity.

TOD

(screaming)

Was it my fault we were running all

that sail?!  Was it my fault she

wasn't dogged down?!!  HUH?!!  I

couldn't help that the ballast

shifted...!  You son of a bitch!!

It wasn't my fault!!  it wasn't.

BILL

It's okay, Tod.

TERRY

Then whose?

TERRY

After the lightning strike, we tried

to go aloft to drop sail.  We'd done

it a thousand times.  We didn't have

to wait for an order.  But Skipper

called us down.

CHARLIE

If the foremast had taken a strike,

everyone in the rigging would've

been fried.  What would you have

done?

TERRY

We would have scalloped the squares

from the deck.  Right Bill?

TOD

That's right, that's right!  Bleed

the sails from the deck and she

could've taken a hurricane!

CHUCK

This is crazy.  Nothing could have

prevented what happened.

MIKE

You guys are missing the point.

This is all because of Phil.  Phil

and his dear old dad.

BILL

What?

MIKE

How do you think they got this

together so fast?  He's been laying

for Skipper since the first day.

CHARLIE

Come on.  Like he's got a vendetta

or some such shit?

MIKE

You got it.

(to Chuck)

I told you he was a turn coat the

day we kicked him off the boat.

CHUCK

No.  You're wrong.

MIKE

I'm telling you, the only way to

change this is to get Phil to call

off his old man.  And that ain't

gonna happen.  So the way I see it,

it's Skipper or us.

CHUCK

Can we talk?

PHIL

I guess.

FRANCIS (O.S.)

Who is it Philip?

PHIL

It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.

(to Chuck)

Look, what do you want?

CHUCK

Everybody's saying this whole

tribunal is happening because of

your father.  Because of you.

PHIL

Well that's just typical isn't it?

CHUCK

Is it true Phil?

PHIL

I gotta go.

CHUCK

You weren't there, you don't know

what happened.

PHIL

(defensive)

I know enough.

CHUCK

Phil, please.  It won't change

anything.  Tell him to call it off.

FRANCIS (O.S.)

Who are you talking to out there

Philip.  Come back in here.

PHIL

I'm sorry.

CHUCK

Wait.

CHUCK

We figured he'd have wanted you to

have it.

(beat)

You do what you've gotta do Phil.

TYLER

The United States Coast Guard has

been asked to conduct this maritime

hearing to consider the revocation

of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S.

Master Seaman's Certificate.

SANDERS

Why didn't you drop any sail?

BILL

Skipper called us out of the

rigging.

SANDERS

But your instinct was to lose sail?

BILL

My instinct was to not get

electrocuted.

SANDERS

How old are you, son?

BILL

(hesitating)

Fifteen.

SANDERS

Thank you.

SANDERS

Philip, why were you discharged from

the Albatross?

PHIL

Skipper thought I was a challenge to

authority.

SANDERS

Were you?

PHIL

I don't know.

FRANCIS

Captain Sheldrake exhibited an

arrogant, controlling attitude in my

presence on more than one occasion.

I believe he had a personality

conflict with my son from the start.

SANDERS

Well, if you don't mind my asking,

sir, why did you let your son stay?

FRANCIS

It was his dream to go.  I could

hardly stand in the way of that,

could I?

SANDERS

Is it true that you forced Robin

Weathers to climb the mast when it

was clear that he was acrophobic.

SKIPPER

He climbed when he was ready.

SANDERS

Were you aware that his brother was

killed in a fall.

MIKE

He did it man.  He sang like a bird.

SKIPPER

Yes, I was.

SANDERS

Sir, were you aware at any time of

the use of alcohol among the crew.

SKIPPER

Yes, I was.

TYLER

And you didn't do anything about it?

SKIPPER

(beat)

No.  I didn't.

CHARLIE

They're twisting it all around.  Why

doesn't he say something?

SANDERS

Had you ever seen a "White Squall"

before this incident?

SKIPPER

No.

SANDERS

What makes you so sure it was one?

SKIPPER

I can't be sure.

SANDERS

You really felt that your crew were

up for the conditions.

SKIPPER

We'd come twelve thousand miles

together, through every kind of seas

imaginable...

SANDERS

Except, a "White Squall".

(beat)

With all due respect Captain

Sheldrake, they're only boys...

SKIPPER

They are much more than that, sir.

SANDERS

Is it true that the reason you

expelled Philip Boutillier...

SKIPPER

(cutting him off)

For killing a dolphin.

SANDERS

... and that you invited him to

strike you?  To fight it out on the

deck of your ship?!

SKIPPER

Yes, that's true.

SANDERS

Do you think this is funny?  Some

kind of joke?  You lost six people

out there.

SKIPPER

(white hot)

I don't think one second of this is

funny, sir.

SANDERS

I have no more questions at this

time.

SANDERS

Oh, one last thing... Isn't true

that your father was a sea Captain?

SKIPPER

Yes.

SANDERS

Isn't also true that his vessel went

down off of Nantucket?  Lost

everyone on board.  In fair weather

no less.

TYLER

What does this have to do with

anything Mr. Sanders?

SANDERS

(smug)

Oh, nothing.  I was just curious.

SKIPPER

My father, was more seaman, more of

a man, than you might ever hope to

be.

TYLER

We'll take a brief recess.

TOD

There's still a way.

BILL

What do you mean?

TOD

It's me, don't you see.  Terry's

right, I'm the escape hatch.  I

disobeyed order.

CHUCK

You taking the order wouldn't have

changed anything.

TOD

They don't know that.

(beat)

We were the only one's on deck.

Look, there's nothing they can do to

me right?  I'm a kid.

CHUCK

But that's not the point...

TOD

That is the point... And Skipper'll

slip off the hook.

DOWNING

Why didn't you turn hard to port as

the wind hit?

TOD

I thought we'd have a better chance

if I headed into the wind so we

could spill air from our sails.

DOWNING

But the Captain ordered you hard to

starboard.

TOD

Twice.

DOWNING

Is that what you were trained to do?

TOD

No.

DOWNING

Then what do you think he was trying

to do.

TOD

Let the blow drive the boat down

wind.  Neutralize our canvas.

DOWNING

So when the captain gave you an

order contrary to your training, you

thought he was making a mistake?

TOD

No.

TYLER

Then why son, why didn't you follow

his order?

TOD

Because -- I panicked.

TOD'S FATHER

That's not true Tod.

TERRY

(to Mike)

What the hell?  What is he doing.

MIKE

Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper

a life boat.

TYLER

If this young man had responded

instantly to your command, do you

believe the ship might have been

spared?

SKIPPER

I don't know that anything could

have prevented what happened.

TYLER

Then what are you trying to say

then?

SKIPPER

Maybe you can't see what's happening

here, but it's clear to me.

(to Tod)

I appreciate what you're trying to

do Tod.  Maybe you could live with

it, but I couldn't.

(to tribunal)

If you think I'm going to let a

sixteen year old take

responsibility, then you

underestimate me.  The Albatross was

my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my

school.  Her loss is mine and mine

alone.

(to others)

I can't bring your sons back.  If

you want my ticket, if that will

ease your loss, it's the least I

can do.  This...

SKIPPER

This is easy.  Living with it,

that'll be hard.

CHUCK

No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not

now.  Not after all of this!!!!

TYLER

That enough son!!  Order!!  Please!!

CHUCK

Tell me Skipper, was it all just a

lie?  "Where we go one, we go all".

We listened to you.  We believed it.

And we're still here!!

CHUCK

Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on

you.

FRANCIS

Sit down!

CHUCK

Tell them the truth.  Make them

understand.

SKIPPER

(smiling)

You tell them Chuck.

CHUCK

It's simple.  Bad things happen

sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or

Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in

this room.  Because we all knew the

risks.

(to parents)

You sent us... You paid our tuition,

you allowed us to go.  So to invent

a reason for why this happened, to

pin it on one person, well that

won't change anything.  It'll just

make our experience meaningless.

CHUCK

If you want to judge this man, judge

him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice

and George.  Chris and John and

Robin.  In one way or another each

one of them gave their lives saving

one of us.  This may sound crazy but

the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or

even a school.  It was something

that we made, that's inside us.

That's who Skipper is.  That's what

he taught us.  I guess what it

really was about was... the

privilege of sacrifice.

CHUCK

Isn't that right?

SKIPPER

That's right.

BILL

When the sun came up, there was

whisky in the cup, and not a one of

us was sober...

CREW TOGETHER

Jenny thought she saw a picture when

it really was the sun, then we knew

the party was over.

CREW TOGETHER

Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you

today, but I know we'll meet again,

when the moon is in the valley and

the leafs are on the trees, We will

come to clearly in the glen...

HARBOR MASTER

What do you think you're doing.

HARBOR MASTER

All right friend, out of the boat.

OLDER CHUCK

(softly)

Stand away.

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

They didn't take his ticket that

day.  But why he never returned to

the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he

hadn't been able to free himself

from the anchor of grief that had

driven him to his knees aboard the

Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared

for the solitude and isolation of

command without his Alice.  Or maybe

it was just that the waves that had

spoken to him for so long, had grown

silent.  Whatever it was, that

thing, it had always troubled me.

Because, fate offers up no reasons.

And maybe that's what I have

traveled these thirty four years to

say.  Maybe that is all I really

know... And, that one man cared.

OLDER CHUCK

Rest easy old salt.  For together

again, we'll sail.

DISSOLVE TO:

OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)

Some time later we learned that one

of our long boats had been

recovered.  Several young men found

it washed up on a nameless beach

somewhere on the island of

Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know

who they were or where they came

from, but they seemed to know of the

Albatross.

(pause)

Sometimes in my dreams those

faceless young men reveal themselves

as my lost companions, and on the

twilight coral sands of forever,

between my slumber and conscious

state, we race naked again, so open

and in love with those precious

moments, running, ever laughing,

ever young, ever free.

SLAM CUT TO:

FADE OUT.

THE END
