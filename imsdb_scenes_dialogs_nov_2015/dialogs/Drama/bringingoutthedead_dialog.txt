"Bringing Out The Dead", early draft, by Paul Schrader

BRINGING OUT THE DEAD

First draft (11/7/97)

Paul Schrader

From the novel by

Joseph Connelly

After World War One it was called

Shell Shock.

After World War Two it was called

Battle Fatigue.

After Vietnam it was called

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Frank Pierce, 28, drives an EMS vehicle for

Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, New York City.

He has been a paramedic for five years.

FRANK (V.O.)

Thursday started out with a bang: a

gunshot to the chest on a drug deal

gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight--

all the elements in place for a long

weekend. I was good at my job: there

were periods when my hands moved

with a speed and skill beyond me and

my mind worked with a cool authority

I had never known. But in the last

year I had started to lose that

control. Things had turned bad. I

hadn't saved anyone for months. I

just needed a few slow nights, a

week without tragedy followed by a

couple of days off.

LARRY

(on radio)

We're there.

OLD WOMAN

Which apartment? Which apartment?

FRANK

Move back. Where's the stairs? 5A.

OLD WOMAN

Oh Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOHN

We were just watching TV and Dad

yelled out and started punching his

chest, next thing he locked himself

in the bathroom. I said we were gonna

call you guys and he said not to.

He was crying, I never heard him

crying before, then he sorta stopped.

We pulled him out and put him on the

bed.

FRANK

How long ago did he stop breathing?

JOHN

Maybe ten minutes. Woman on the phone

tried to tell us how to do CPR.

Please, you gotta do something.

FRANK

We'll do all we can.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Clear! Clear!

MARY

No more, please don't!

FRANK (V.O.)

In the last year I had come to believe

in such things as spirits leaving

the body and not wanting to be put

back, spirits angry at the awkward

places death had left them.  I

understood how crazy it was to think

this way, but I was convinced if I

turned around, I'd see Old Man Burke

standing at the window, watching,

waiting for us to finish.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(to Larry)

I'll take over. Call ER and ask for

an eighty-three.

(to Mrs. Burke)

Sorry.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Do you have any music?

MARY

What?

FRANK

Music. I think it helps if you play

something he liked.

MARY

John, play the Sinatra.

MARY

Play the Sinatra.

LARRY

It's OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty-

three.

FRANK

No we can't. He's got a pulse.

LARRY

No shit.

MARY

Is he going to be alright?

FRANK

(not encouraging)

His heart's beating.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Have 'em bring up a stretcher.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Help your family. Ride with your

mother and brother.

(she hesitates)

Help your family. They need you more.

Help yourself.

CUT TO:

FRANK (V.O.)

I needed to concentrate because my

mind tended to wander on these short

trips. It was the neighborhood I

grew up in and where I had worked

most as a paramedic, and it held

more ghosts per square foot than any

other.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GRISS

Hey partner. Your man does not look

well. They're not gonna appreciate

you inside.

FRANK

(pumping Ambu-bag)

Griss, let us in.

GRISS

Things are backing up.

GRISS (CONT'D)

You can't go in there, folks.

NURSE CONSTANCE

Just keep moving. Don't even slow

down.

NURSE CONSTANCE (CONT'D)

Sir, you say you've been snorting

cocaine for three days and now you

feel your heart is beating too fast

and you would like us to help you.

To tell the truth, I don't see why I

should. If I'm mistaken, correct me.

Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we

push it up your nose?

NOEL

For God's sake, give me some water.

BIG FEET

Shut up! Goddamn civilians.

NOEL

Give me some water!

NURSE CRUPP

Don't take another step. We're on

diversion. Can't accept any more

patients. Your dispatcher should

have told you.

FRANK

We got him at Eighteen and Second.

You're closest.

NURSE CRUPP

Where will I put him, Frank? Look.

Tell me.

FRANK

He wanted to come here. Said the

nurses at Misery were the best.

NURSE CRUPP

(acquiesces)

All right, give me a minute. I'll

kick someone out of slot three.

NOEL

(to Frank)

Excuse me. You are a very kind man.

I can see that. A man like you could

not refuse a poor sick dying helpless

man a small cup of water.

FRANK

I can't. I have to stay with my

patient.

BIG FEET

Shut the fuck up! If it wasn't for

these dun feet I'd get up and kick

your ass!

HAZMAT

Godammit, guys, what are you doing

to me? We're all backed up in here.

Christ, would you look at him? He's

gonna need the works. What's wrong

with him?

LARRY

You should know. You pronounced him.

HAZMAT

You told me he was dead. Flatline.

FRANK

He got better.

HAZMAT

I hate pronouncing people dead over

the phone.

(flashes light in

Burke's eyes)

Better, huh? They're fixed and

dilated. He's plant food.

NURSE CRUPP

(returning)

We stole a stretcher from X-ray. No

pad on it, but I don't think he'll

mind. Put him in three, next to the

overdose.

HAZMAT

He's our lowest priority now. He

shouldn't even be here. All this

technology. What a waste.

GRISS

Please folks, step back.

(they hesitate)

Don't make me take off my sunglasses.

HAZMAT

First-time heart attack, age 45.

Should have gone to the CCU ten hours

ago. There's three bodies up there

Mike the one you just brought in.

over there, two AIDS patients, one

in twelve filling up with liquid.

I'm gonna hafta intubate because the

kid's mother won't sign the Do Not

Resuscitate. Mercy killing doesn't

translate well in Spanish. It's a

sin to tube this kid. Three more ODs

from some new killer junk. They call

it Red Death.

NOEL

Water, water, water, doctor man,

water.

HAZMAT

A mix of heroin and I don't know

what else, some kind of amino acid

maybe. Stuff so strong they're

drinking it with grain alcohol. You

have to use ten times the usual amount

of Narcan and watch out when they

wake up, liable to go nuts on you.

FRANK

(about Noel)

He one of them?

HAZMAT

No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular

off and on, hasn't been in in a while.

He seized and almost coded--I gave

him a hypertonic solution. He drank

so much the kidneys were taking out

salt. One for the textbooks.

NOEL

Oh doctor, you are the greatest. You

must help me.

BIG FEET

For God's sake, give him a drink of

water.

HAZMAT

I am helping you, Noel. You could

die if you drink more water.

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

What is it?

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

Crupp, start CPR. Milagros, get me

an epi. Odette wake up Dr. Stark.

Tell him I need a blood gas, stat.

NOEL

Bless you sir, bless you.

BIG FEET

Shut up.

NURSE CONSTANCE

... so you get drunk every day and

you fall down. Tell me why we should

help you when you're going to get

drunk tomorrow and fall down again?

FRANK

(stock reply)

He's very very sick.

MARY

I know him. That's Noel.

FRANK

We'd better go outside. Quickly.

CUT TO:

MARY

Is there any chance?

FRANK

(shakes head)

I guess there's always a chance.

MARY

Noel, Noel, it's me, Mary. From 17th

Street.

NOEL

Mary, Mary, Mary. I'm so thirsty.

They won't give me anything to drink.

Please, Mary.

MARY

(heading inside)

I'll get you some.

FRANK

I wouldn't do that.

(Noel drinks)

The doctor seems to think he's

suffering from some rare disorder.

MARY

It's not so rare. He grew up on our

street. He's had a rough life and

he's a little crazy from it, but

that's no excuse for not giving

someone a lousy cup of water.

MARY (CONT'D)

My father's dying, Noel.

NOEL

Oh Mary, Mary, Mary.

CUT TO:

LARRY

The Chinese close in five minutes.

Beef lo mein. It's  been on my

mind since I woke. Whatjathink?

FRANK

I think the moment that food hits

your mouth we'll get a job.

LARRY

Turn here. You missed it. The Chink

is on 3rd.

WHORE #1

Hey ambulance man. What you looking

at?

WHORE #2

Pretty soon you'll be coming for me.

LARRY

Some partner you are Frank. I coulda

walked there faster. I'm starving

and you stop to talk to hookers.

You're making me nuts. Is that what

you're trying to do, drag me down

with you to nutsville?

LARRY (CONT'D)

(slams dashboard)

Oh no!--I just remembered.

FRANK

What?

LARRY

I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein

last night. I can't eat the same

thing two nights in a row. It's almost

two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna

do? What you getting?

FRANK

I'm not hungry.

LARRY

Oh yeah, you don't eat food.

FRANK

I eat. I just haven't had coffee

yet.

LARRY

Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't

dead with that diet. Wait, I've got

it. Half fried chicken with fries.

Let's go, hurry up. Come on.

FRANK (V.O.)

Rose was getting closer. Ever since

the call a month before, when I'd

lost her, she seemed like all the

girls in the neighborhood. One of

the first things you learn is to

avoid bad memories. I used to be an

expert, but lately I'd found some

holes. Anything could trigger it.

The last month belonged to Rose, but

there were a hundred more ready to

come out.

CUT TO:

FRANK (V.O.)

These spirits were part of the job.

It was impossible to pass a building

that didn't bold the spirit of

something: the eyes of a corpse, the

screams of a loved one. All bodies

leave their mark. You cannot be near

the new dead without feeling it.

FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I could handle that. What haunted me

now was more savage: spirits born

half-finished, homicides, suicides,

overdoses, innocent or not, accusing

me of being there, witnessing a

humiliation which they could never

forgive.

LARRY

Turn it off.

FRANK

What?

LARRY

You know what. The radio.

POLICE DISPATCH

Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22 four

flight residential, 317 East 32nd.

LARRY

Let's do it. It might be a good one.

FRANK

You wanted it turned off. There's no

such thing as a good fire. People

get burned up. They can't breathe.

LARRY

That's what we're here for. Come on,

Frank.

FRANK

Don't push it, Larry.

LARRY

You're burned out.

RADIO DISPATCHER

One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need

you.

LARRY

You see, he's giving it to us anyway.

RADIO DISPATCHER

Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an

unconscious at First and St. Marks.

LARRY

(screams)

No! It's three o'clock. That can

only mean one thing.

FRANK

Mr. Oh.

LARRY

It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.

RADIO DISPATCHER

Answer the radio Zebra. You know

it's that time.

LARRY

Four times this week I've had him.

Aren't there any other units out

there?  Don't answer the radio.

They'll give it to someone else.

RADIO DISPATCHER

Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra.

You're going out of service in two

seconds.

LARRY

Look, Frank, when I say don't answer

it, that means answer it.

(picks up the mike)

You can do that for me at least.

(keys mike)

Three Zebra.

RADIO DISPATCHER

Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the

man who needs no introduction, chronic

caller of the year three straight

and shooting for number four. The

duke of drunk, the king of stink,

our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.

LARRY

Ten-four.

(Frank starts the

engine)

Don't go. Not this time.

FRANK

(driving off)

Relax, it's a street job, easy except

for the smell. We'll just throw him

in back and zip over to Mercy--no

blood, no dying, that's how I look

at it. He's just a drunk.

LARRY

It's not our job to taxi drunks

around.

FRANK

They'll just keep calling.

LARRY

Someone's gonna die someday causa

that bum, going to have a cardiac

and the only medics will be taking

care of Mr. Oh.

CUT TO:

MALE STREET PERSON #1

He's bad mister. He ain't eaten nuthin

all day, he's seizing and throwing

up.

LARRY

(hand over nose)

So what's different?

MALE STREET PERSON #1

He says his feet hurt.

FRANK

Well why didn't you say so?

LARRY

He's drunk.

MALE STREET PERSON #2

He's sick. You gotta help him.

LARRY

He's fine. He can walk to the

hospital.

FEMALE STREET PERSON

Walk? You crazy? He's in a wheelchair.

LARRY

Don't start that. I've seen him walk.

He walks better than me.

MR. OH

Oh, oh, oh.

LARRY

That's him, Mr. Oh.

(pulls at his arm)

Get up.

CROWD

Good luck! Get better!

CUT TO:

LARRY

Faster! God!

FRANK

(flips on top lights)

Faster!

CUT TO:

GRISS

Get that stinky-assed motherfucking

bug-ridden skell out of my face.

NURSE CONSTANCE

I would have to register you to give

you something to eat and my conscience

just will not allow that. Griss,

the gentleman wants to leave.

(looks at Oh)

He looks pale. You're not eating

enough. You need more fiber.

LARRY

(holds up his report)

He's wasted. That's my diagnosis:

shit-faced.

NURSE CONSTANCE

He just needs a bath and some food.

Take him in back and see if you can

find a stretcher.

LARRY

(to Frank)

She's nuts. That's why he comes here.

She encourages him.

NURSE CRUPP

Don't you dare! That's my last

stretcher. This is not a homeless

shelter. He'll have to wait in the

lobby.

GRISS

No way man. Not even in the corner.

Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.

CUT TO:

MARY

It's my first cigarette in over a

year.

FRANK

The first is always the best.

MARY

It's the waiting that's killing me,

not knowing, you know? It's really

hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't

think my father'll make it. He says

he was dead too long, after six

minutes the brain starts to die and

once that goes, close the door.

FRANK

You never know.

MARY

I mean if he was dead, I could handle

that.

FRANK

At least he's got people around him.

MARY

I'm not so sure. My father and I

haven't spoken in three years. When

my brother called to say my father

was having a heart attack, that he'd

locked himself in the bathroom, all

the way going over I was thinking

how I was gonna tell him what a

bastard he was. Then when I got up

the stairs and we moved him onto the

bed, I thought of all these other

things I wanted to say.

FRANK

Even when you say the things, there's

always more things.

MARY

Right now, I'm more worried about my

mother than anything. They won't let

her see my father.

FRANK

Go home. Take her home. Get some

rest. Not going to find anything out

now.

MARY

That's what I told her. If she could

just see him a second, then I could

take her home.

LARRY

Time to switch. I wheel, you heal.

CUT TO:

RADIO DISPATCHER

12 David on the corner of Thirty-

eight and Two you'll find a three-

car accident, two taxis and a taxi.

One-two Henry, 427 East Two-two,

report of a very bad smell. No further

information ...

FRANK

Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're

gonna hafta run one of these calls.

LARRY

Relax, will you.

FRANK (V.O.)

The biggest problem with not driving

is that whenever there's a patient

in back you're also in the back.

The doors close, you're trapped.

Four in the morning is always the

worst time for me, just before dawn,

just when you've been lulled into

thinking it might be safe to close

your eyes for one minute. That's

when I first found Rose ...

FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

She was on the sidewalk, not

breathing.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I

say we go back to the hospital and

call it a night.

LARRY

You have no sick time, Frank. No

time of any kind. Everyone knows

that.

FRANK

Take me back, put me to bed; I

surrender. We've done enough damage

tonight.

LARRY

You take things too seriously. Look

at us, we're cruising around, talking,

taking some quiet time, getting paid

for it. We've got a good job here.

FRANK

Yeah, you're right.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Tell me, you ever think of doing

anything else?

LARRY

Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam

next year. After the kids are in

school, Louise can go back to the

post office and, I thought, what the

hell, I'll start my own medic service.

Out on the Island the volunteers are

becoming salaried municipal. It's

just a matter of time and who you

know. Someday it's going to be Chief

Larry calling the shots.

FRANK (V.O.)

I'd always had nightmares, but now

the ghosts didn't wait for me to

sleep. I drank every day. Help others

and you help yourself, that was my

motto, but I hadn't saved anyone in

months. It seemed all my patients

were dying. I'd waited, sure the

sickness would break, tomorrow night,

the next call, the feeling would

drop away. More than anything else I

wanted to sleep like that, close my

eyes and drift away ...

RADIO DISPATCHER

Zebra. One-three Zebra.

(Frank opens eyes)

Zebra, answer the radio. Come on,

I've got one for you. Pick up the

radio and push the button on the

side and speak into the front.

FRANK

(answering call)

Zebra.

RADIO DISPATCHER

Male bleeding, corner of Houston and

One. No further information.

FRANK

Ten-four.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We have a call Chief. Somebody's

bleeding, Houston and First.

CUT TO:

NOEL

Kill me!

FRANK

Noel, don't!

LARRY

He's crazy.

FRANK

You really think so?

NOEL

See, I can't do it. I came out of

the desert.

FRANK

You came out of the hospital. You

were tied down and hallucinating.

You got some bad chemicals in your

head, Noel. There's some medicine at

the hospital that will fix that.

NOEL

No, no medicine!

LARRY

He got you.

BLACK PUNK

Do it! Man wants to die. Take him

out! I know how to kill that mother.

(points a finger)

Pop, pop.

FRANK

Noel, you didn't let me finish. We

have rules against killing people on

the street. Looks bad, but there's a

special room at the hospital for

terminating. A nice quiet room with

a big bed.

NOEL

Oh man, do you mean that?

(smiles)

Thank you man, thank you. How?

FRANK

Well, you have your choice: pills,

injection, gas.

NOEL

I think pills. Yes, pills, definitely.

LARRY

Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy

motherfucker.

FRANK

Used to be my partner.

WALLS

Frank, this the guy you called about?

I know him.

(pushes Noel)

You give my friend here any trouble

and I'll kill you.

NOEL

Yes, at the hospital.

WALLS

This looks like a very bad man I

took in a couple weeks ago, a man

who'd been holding two priests hostage

with a screwdriver. I told him if I

ever caught him making trouble again

I'd kick the murdering life outta

him.

FRANK

It's not worth it, Tom. He's

surrendering.

WALLS

No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank,

just a little psychological first

aid.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Stay still, dammit!

FRANK

Don't do it, Tom!

LARRY

There's a double shooting three blocks-

up. First and Third. confirmed.

WALLS

(looking up)

We'll do it.

NOEL

At the hospital. You told me at the

hospital.

CUT TO:

FRANK & WALLS

EMS. Move it!

BYSTANDER

Man just walked up and shot 'em. Not

a word. Man, that was cold.

FRANK

(to Drug Dealer)

Where you hit?

VOICE IN CROWD

Outlaw did this. He works for Cy.

FRANK

Major Tom, I'm going to Misery. You

take yours to Bellvue.

CUT TO:

FRANK

You're gonna feel a stick in your

arm. Don't move.

DRUG DEALER

I don't want to die.

NOEL

I want to die. I'm the one.

DRUG DEALER

Oh Jesus, I don't want to die.

FRANK

You're not going to die.

NOEL

What did you say?

FRANK

(to Noel)

Shut up. You're going to die and

he's not. Got it.

DRUG DEALER

(weak)

Hold my hand.

FRANK

I can't. I got to do the other arm.

DRUG DEALER

Please.

FRANK

(to Noel)

Hold this--right there. If you let

go, I swear, I won't kill you.

CUT TO:

FRANK

It's all right. We're here.

LARRY

Noel, let's go.

FRANK

He's not breathing. Call a code.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARY

Hello again.

MARY (CONT'D)

You shouldn't smoke.

FRANK

It's okay. They're prescription.

(beat)

Works better with a little whiskey.

MARY

That's my brother's problem. He's

passed out inside.

LARRY

That's it! I can't do it anymore!

MARY

That boy you brought in, he was shot,

wasn't he?

FRANK

Yes.

MARY

He's dead, huh?

FRANK

Yes.

MARY

(pause)

I think this place stinks.

FRANK

Our Lady of Misery.

MARY

Did you see my father?

FRANK

No.

MARY

It's crazy in there. What's wrong

with that doctor? He keeps mumbling,

poking himself in the eye when he

talks to me.

FRANK

He's working a double shift.

MARY

Thing is, I'm supposed to be the

fuckup. The one on the stretcher in

there--that's supposed to be me.

With my parents crying out here. I

got a lot of guilt, you know what I

mean?

MARY (CONT'D)

My father's in a coma, now my mother's

going crazy. It's like she's in a

trance.

FRANK

She should go home.

MARY

I'd take her, but then who would

stay here?

FRANK

Here she is.

MRS. BURKE

It wasn't him.

MARY

You saw him?

MRS. BURKE

They showed me someone. It wasn't

him. It wasn't my husband.

FRANK

Mrs. Burke, please, they'll take

care of him. You should go home now.

MRS. BURKE

I should know my own husband. They

wouldn't let me see him.

FRANK

Larry and I'll drop her back home.

Help me get her to the ambulance.

MRS. BURKE

You want some coffee? I have some

apple sauce cake too.

MARY

Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

FRANK (V.O.)

Saving someone's life is like falling

in love, the best drug in the world.

For days, sometimes weeks afterwards,

you walk the street making infinite

whatever you see. Once, for weeks I

couldn't feel the earth. Everything

I touched became light. Horns played

in my shoes; flowers fell from my

pockets ...

FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You wonder if you've become immortal,

as if you saved your own life as

well. What was once criminal and

happenstance suddenly makes sense.

God has passed through you, why deny

it, that for a moment there, God was

you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FRANK

Good morning, Captain.

CAPT. BARNEY

What am I going to to do with this

guy?

(to Frank)

Pierce, I was just on the phone with

Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts

this month, you've been late for

nine, sick four and that includes

the shift where you came late and

went home early.

FRANK

I'm sick. That's what I've been

telling you.

CAPT. BARNEY

You're killing me, you know that?

You got no sick time according to

Command. I've been told to terminate.

FRANK

It's okay. I'll just get my things

out of the locker.

CAPT. BARNEY

I've never fired anyone in my life.

FRANK

I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too

hard.

CAPT. BARNEY

Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I

told them: shove it up the big one.

(looks at Miss Williams)

Sorry.

(back to Frank)

I said, you want to fire him, come

over and do it yourself.

FRANK

You know they won't do it. It's up

to you. You gotta be strong.

CAPT. BARNEY

I feel for you, but we got an

emergency here. It's a weekend of

full moons.  Everyone's called in

sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too.

We need bodies out there. I had to

put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know

he's not supposed to work two nights

in a row.

FRANK

You swore you'd fire me if I came in

late again.

CAPT. BARNEY

I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better

than that, I'll forward you some

sick time. A week, two weeks off--

how about that?

FRANK

I don't think a week's gonna do it.

CAPT. BARNEY

I'm sorry, Pierce.

(hands Frank keys)

You're going out with Marcus. Duty

calls. The City needs you.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

My Lord mother man, you look like

hell. What were you drinking?

FRANK

The captain almost fired me tonight.

I'm on my way out. Anytime now.

MARCUS

Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only

thing they might do is transfer you

to the Bronx. You look like you aged

ten years since I rode with you last.

FRANK

The ghosts--

MARCUS

You ever notice people who see shit

always, are crazy?

FRANK

I think the worst is over.

MARCUS

It can always get worse. You can't

change what's out there, only where

you're coming from. You got to let

the Lord take over, in here.

(points to Frank's

chest)

DISPATCHER LOVE

Twelve Young.

(beat)

Let's go, Twelve Young. Answer the

radio.

FRANK

Hey, Marcus, it's Love. I haven't

heard her in months.

MARCUS

She only works when I'm on. I make

her wait and it drives her crazy.

FRANK

Is it true that you and Love went on

a blind date?

(Marcus looks away)

She hit you with a bottle?

MARCUS

She loves me the way no woman ever

has.

DISPATCHER LOVE

Twelve Young, I don't have time for

your games. Now answer me or do I

have to come out there myself?

MARCUS

I usually don't do calls before

coffee. But I think it might do you

some good.

(picks up mike)

Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna

take care of you, baby. Don't you

worry about a thing, yahear, cause

Marcus is alive and on arrival.

DISPATCHER LOVE

I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not

your mother either. You're going to

a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth,

northeast corner. It's a club. Take

the side entrance.

MARCUS

Ten-four, hon.

(to Frank)

This is for you.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

(to crowd)

I hope we're not late from you guys

holding us up here.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

Okay, what happened?

DRUMMER

He's going to be all right, right?

MARCUS

No. He's dead.

DRUMMER

No way, man.

MARCUS

He's dead and there's nothing we can

do. Come on, Frank, that's it.

FRANK

(whispers)

He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose.

Break out the Narcon.

MARCUS

(announcing)

He's dead unless you folks want to

stop bullshitting me and tell it

straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll

try to bring him back.

BYSTANDER

He broke up with his old lady.

GIRLFRIEND

We didn't break up. We were just

seeing other people.

MARCUS

I'm still waiting and this young man

is still dead.

BYSTANDER

She broke his heart.

DRUMMER

All right, all right, he's been

snorting that Red Death stuff. Been

going for four days.

MARCUS

(brings hands together)

What's his name?

DRUMMER

IB Bangin.

MARCUS

What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind

of name is IB Bangin?

GIRLFRIEND

(Hesitant)

It's Frederick. Frederick Smith.

MARCUS

(to body)

Okay, Freddy.

GIRLFRIEND

It's Frederick.

MARCUS

Okay, IB Bangin, we're gonna bring

you back. Every person here grab the

hand of the person next to you.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Oh Lord, here I am again to ask one

more chance for a sinner. Bring back

IB Bangin, Lord. You have the power,

the might, the super light, to spare

this worthless man.

GIRLFRIEND

(kneeling)

Frederick!

BYSTANDER

Oh wow, man. Oh wow.

IB BANGIN

(sick)

What happened?

GIRLFRIEND

You died, you stupid bastard. I warned

you.

DRUMMER

You guys are awesome.

FRANK

(to IB Bangin)

C'mon.

MARCUS

Not us. The first step is Love. The

second is Mercy.

CUT TO:

FRANK

That guy I brought in yesterday,

post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

HAZMAT

Burke. You won't believe it. He's

showing cognitive signs. He started

with spontaneous respiration, now

he's fighting to pull out the tube.

Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT

scan. I'm giving him every test I

can: thromboytics, steroids,

nitrodrips, heparin.

FRANK

What do you think?

HAZMAT

Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem-

activity. The heart refuses to

stabilize--he's coded eleven times

since he got here. This guy's a

fighter. Every time the Valium wears

off he starts yanking those

restraints.

FRANK

The family know?

HAZMAT

I wanted to bring them in, to see if

he'd respond to voices, but they

weren't in the waiting room. The

guy's daughter was in my face all

last night and when I finally have

something positive to tell her, she's

gone.

NURSE CONSTANCE

... you put poison in your veins and

now that you're breathing again you

can't wait to say thank you and go

back to poison shopping. Well, since

we saved your life, maybe you could

do us a favor and stop breathing in

another city next time ...

CUT TO:

MARCUS

I ever tell you about the time years

ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying

to talk this psycho inside?

FRANK

Where the guy jumped and you almost

fell. No, you never told me that

story.

MARCUS

No, you never listened. I was going,

man, if someone on high hadn't pulled

me in. I had put all I had into saving

this dumbass lowlife suicidal that

when he went down, there was a part

of me that wanted to go with him.

FRANK

Make a left here. I want to stop.

CUT TO:

FRANK

I'll be right back.

MARY (V.O.)

Yes?

FRANK

Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the

ambulance last night. I brought your

father into the hospital and I just

learned some news.

MARY (V.O.)

I'll be right down.

MARY (CONT'D)

He's better, isn't he?

FRANK

Well, the doctor says he's showing

some movement. It's still early, it

might mean nothing, but I thought

you'd want to know.

MARY

I knew. I sensed it when I heard

your voice.

FRANK

You look so different.

MARY

I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night

of the Living Cheerleaders.

FRANK

I think it looks good.

MARY

I was going nuts in that waiting

room so I came back to check on my

mom.

FRANK

How is she?

MARY

Sleeping.

FRANK

I was just going to get some food.

Pizza. Maybe we could.

MARY

You can't kill my father that easy.

He'll fight forever. Like with me:

hasn't talked to me in three years.

But it's okay. Sometimes you have to

put things behind you.

FRANK

Be tough to get a taxi here. We can

give you a ride if you like.

MARY

(looks at him)

Okay.

MARCUS

Who's that?

FRANK

She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest

I brought in last night. I told her

we'd give her a ride back to Misery.

Her father's showing signs of

improving.

MARCUS

Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so

much worse than I thought.

FRANK

I'm hungry too. We gotta get some

food after this.

MARCUS

God help us, he's hungry too.

CUT TO:

MARY

Dad, can you hear me?

(beat)

Open your eyes if you can hear me.

MARY (CONT'D)

He squeezed my hand!

MARY (CONT'D)

He's moving, Doctor. He grabbed my

hand. Move your hand, Dad, one more

time.

(Burke's hand twitches))

See. See.

HAZMAT

I'll be damned.

(check's Burke's pupils)

It's movement, but I'm not sure how

voluntary.

MARY

He hears me. Open your eyes, Dad.

HAZMAT

Nurse Crupp, I need ten milligrams

of Valium.

FRANK

Why don't we go outside for a little

while, wait until this passes.

CUT TO:

FRANK

He wants to pull that tube out. It's

pretty painful--that's why they keep

him sedated--but it's a good sign.

MARY

You sure? I know my father would

hate to be tied down. He wouldn't

even go to the dentist.

FRANK

That's how it's done. You have to

keep the body going until the brain

and heart recover enough to go on

their own.

MARY

He's better, though, right?

FRANK

(reluctant)

He's better.

MARY

Look, I'm sorry, but it's important

to me. I mean, a week ago I was

wishing he was dead. And now I want

hear his voice again, just once more--

you know what I mean?

MARCUS

Went over to Sal's got this. There

must be some place in Hell for a guy

who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I

call you if anything comes up.

FRANK

Thanks.

MARY

I'm not really hungry.

MARY (CONT'D)

My father was a great man, you know.

There was nobody he wouldn't help.

You know that crazy guy Noel who I

gave water to last night? He lived

in our house for almost a year. A

total stranger he'd do anything for,

his own family though ...

FRANK

It's best not to ...

(off her look)

It's good pizza, huh?

MARY

Not as good as Nino's.

FRANK

You remember that pizza place, Joe's

on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years

ago?  When you ordered a pie it came

with a little plastic madonna in the

middle?

MARY

Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the

neighborhood?

FRANK

I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to

Blessed Sacrament.

MARY

On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd

you go to high school?

FRANK

We moved out after that. Upstate.

MARY

Like everybody else--except us. Always

standing on the sidewalk waving

goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents

... ?

FRANK

They're fine. My old man was a bus

driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of

born to it, I guess.

MARY

You married?

FRANK

Ah, no. I was.

(beat)

It's hard to explain. She had a hard

time adjusting to, well, maybe it

was my fault too.

DRUNK (O.S.)

White cocksuckers! Get your--Ow!

MARY

Is it always this bad in here? I

mean, how does anyone survive?

FRANK

It's been bad lately, but it's always

bad.

MARY

How long you been doing this?

FRANK

Five years.

MARY

Wow, you musta seen some things,

huh? What's the worst thing you ever

seen?

FRANK

You learn to sort of block it out,

you know, like cops fence off a crime

scene. But then something good will

happen and everything will just glow.

MARY

You must get a lot of overdoses. I

bet you picked me up a couple of

times.

FRANK

I think I'd remember that.

MARY

Maybe not. I was a different person

then. Does everybody you meet spill

their problems on you like this?

FRANK

Mostly. It must be my face. My mother

always said I looked like a priest.

MARY

(wipes her mouth)

I better go check on my father. Thanks

for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe

when he gets better, you know, when

we're done with all this.

FRANK

Sure.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Look after her, Griss, okay?

CUT TO:

MARCUS

Rule number one: Don't get involved

with patients. Rule number two: Don't

get involved with patient's daughters.

You understand?

FRANK

What about rule number three: Don't

get involved with dispatchers named

Love.

MARCUS

You don't know the first thing about

rule number three, cannot begin to

understand the complexities of that

rule. Come on, let's go look at some

hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting

out.

(relevant to nothing)

Don't ever call a junkie whore a

crackhead. They get real mad.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Look at these women. You can't even

tell who's a hooker anymore. Whatever

happened to go-go boots and hot pants?

They wear anything now, walk outta

the house with whatever they got

on ...

FRANK (V.O.)

The street is so much more

unpredictable than the ER and to

prepare for the unexpected I was

taught to act without thinking, like

an army private who can take apart

and reassemble a gun blindfolded ...

FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I realized that my training was useful

in less than ten percent of the calls

and saving someone's life was rarer

than that. As the years went by I

grew to understand that my role was

less about saving lives than about

bearing witness. I was a grief mop

and much of my job was to remove, if

even for a short time, the grief

starter or the grief product. It was

enough I simply showed up.

MARCUS

... look at her. Leaves you no idea

what's underneath, not even a

suggestion. Could be a skeleton for

all you know.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Nice though, pulling back her hood

as we drive by. There's a mystery to

it, then she shows you.

FRANK

She's no whore, Marcus.

MARCUS

We're all whores, Frank. You know

what I'm talking about, the way she

looked at me.

FRANK

She wasn't looking at you, man, she

was looking at me.

"ROSE"

Why did you kill me, Frank?

FRANK

I didn't kill you.

MARCUS

No, you didn't, Frank, thank you.

But there's still a couple hours

left on the shift.

FRANK

I need a drink, that's all.

DISPATCHER LOVE

Twelve Young, answer the radio. I

have a call for you.

MARCUS

She said to me, I love the way you

talk on the radio.

DISPATCHER LOVE

I can't wait all night, Young. I'm

holding a priority and if you don't

answer I'm going to knock you out of

service.

MARCUS

(keys radio)

Don't worry, hon. Young is here and

he's gonna help out--just remember,

you owe me.

DISPATCHER LOVE

You're going to three-four Avenue C,

17 year-old female cardiac arrest,

no further information.

MARCUS

Ten-four, hon.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a

first.

FRANK

(to Maria)

What's wrong.

CARLOS

No English. She has terrible pain in

her belly.

FRANK

(hands on stomach)

Pregnant.

CARLOS

No, no, that's impossible.

FRANK

Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Can you walk? Puedes caminar?

CARLOS

She say she in great pain.

FRANK

Thanks for the translation.

(to Maria)

What's your name? Nombre?

MARIA

Maria.

FRANK

Let's have a look.

MARCUS

(to Carlos)

You know each other a long time?

CARLOS

Two years. Ever since we left island.

MARCUS

In that time, you ever have sex?

CARLOS

Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no

booze.

MARCUS

No underwear?

CARLOS

We are virgins.

FRANK

(inspecting Maria)

Oh Jesus, we'd better go. Call for

backup.

FRANK (CONT'D)

It's coming.

(to Carlos)

Hold her down.

MARCUS

What's that, Frank?

FRANK

Three legs.

MARCUS

That's too many.

FRANK

Backup?

MARCUS

It's coming.

CARLOS

Is she dying?

FRANK

She's having a baby. Twins.

CARLOS

Es impossible.

FRANK

You can trust me on this one.

CARLOS

It's a miracle.

FRANK

You take the first one.

CUT TO:

FRANK

She had a pulse.

NURSE CONSTANCE

Code! Code Blue!

HAZMAT

Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor.

Where's the pediatric code cart?

(Odette arriving with

cart)

Odette give me that tube. All right,

flatline--let's do CPR. step back,

Frank. How many months?

FRANK

Can't tell. It was a breech, twins.

The other one seems okay, though.

Marcus is taking him and the mother

to Maternity.

CRACKHEAD

I'm a mother! I got a daughter! I

got rights!

HAZMAT

(to nurse)

10 mil Valium, stat.

MISHRA

Status.

NURSE CONSTANCE

I think there's a pulse. I think.

MISHRA

Fuck.

NURSE CONSTANCE

Nothing.

NOEL

Excuse me, sir, excuse me, I would

please trouble you for one cup of

water. The smallest thing in the

world to ask for, water. A man is

dying and that is me.

NOEL (CONT'D)

For days I've eaten nothing but sand,

O Lord, I waited so long.

HAZMAT

Christ. Who the hell woke him up?

CUT TO:

FRANK

Don't give me that look.

MARCUS

What look?

FRANK

You know what I'm talking about.

It's all over your face. That I-just-

saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

MARCUS

We just saved a little baby boy.

Think of it that way.

FRANK

I don't want to hear about it, okay?

That's three jobs for the night.

It's over. Three jobs and time for a

drink. Six am, the cocktail hour.

Pass the bottle; I know you're

holding.

MARCUS

The bar is now open.

FRANK

I hate vodka.

MARCUS

Please, a little decorum if you will.

What I was going to say is, is that

holding that baby in my arms, I felt

like I was twenty-one again. A call

like that makes me think of going

back to three nights a week, not

two, start running again, cut down

on the drinking.

FRANK

(pours drink)

I'll drink to that.

MARCUS

(raises cup)

Here's to the greatest job in the

world.

FRANK

(knocks vodka back)

Greatest job in the world.

DISPATCHER LOVE

Twelve Young, I have priorities

holding. Pick up the radio.

FRANK

Don't do it, Marcus. Tell her the

bus died, our radio's not working,

our backs are out. Tell her we're

too drunk to take any more calls.

MARCUS

Let's do it!

(keys mike)

It's Marcus, Love, only for you.

DISPATCHER LOVE

Male diff breather, approximately

30, Houston and A.

MARCUS

Ten-four.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

I'm coming, Love! I'm coming!

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Shit.

MARCUS (CONT'D)

Where you going?

FRANK

I quit! I'm through!

MARCUS

You can't leave me now.

CUT TO:

FRANK

So long, Noel.

FRANK (CONT'D)

What's going on, Griss?

GRISS

Your friend there just untied the

water beggar. Griss was coming out

to thank her. Probably saved Griss a

murder charge.

(about Mary)

Having a tough time of it.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Excuse me. You seemed like you were

in trouble.

MARY

(steps over)

I'm all right. I just can't stand to

see people tied up.  I'm in the

waiting room for hours, listening to

Noel screaming. The only reason he's

screaming is 'cause he's tied up.

FRANK

Don't seem so bad to me.

MARY

Don't say that. I wanted to cut my

father loose too. They told me he

almost died and five minutes later

they say he's better and I go in.

It's killing me seeing him fighting

like that.

(gazes up building)

Look, since you're here, maybe you

could do me a favor. I need you to

wait for me outside this building,

okay? I have to visit a friend who's

sick.

FRANK

Okay.

MARY

I'm only asking because it's a

dangerous building. There's been

some robberies, a woman was raped

not long ago. This woman I'm seeing,

she'll want to talk to me all day,

but if I can point to you out the

window and say you're waiting, I can

be out quick. if anything happens,

I'll be in apartment 16M.

FRANK

Maybe I should come up with you.

MARY

If I'm not back in fifteen minutes,

hit the buzzer. That way she'll let

me go.

FRANK

Nothing's going to happen. I'll come

with you.

MARY

No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting

a sick friend.

CUT TO:

MARY

I shouldn't have asked you to come.

FRANK

You asked me not to come.

MARY

Promise you won't go inside.

FRANK

Fifteen minutes.

MARY

I just have to relax a little. Not

feel so guilty all the time.

FRANK

We can still go back. I'll walk you

home. You sleep a couple of hours,

watch some TV, take a bath.

MARY

Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts

about this, it's my fault.

CUT TO:

MARY

You go on home, okay. I'm fine,

really. I don't need you. Thanks.

KANITA

Hey Cy, guess who's here?

COATES (O.S.)

Mary ...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KANITA

Can I help you?

FRANK

Mary Burke. She's a friend.

KANITA

She's not here.

KANITA (CONT'D)

Wait a minute. You can't go in.

COATES

It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.

KANITA

He looks like a cop.

COATES

He's not a cop, he's a medic.

(extends hand)

I'm CY Coates.

FRANK

Frank Pierce.

COATES

Mary said you might be coming.

FRANK

Where is she?

COATES

Sleeping in the back.

FRANK

She asked me to pick her up.

COATES

I know, but she told me to tell you

she wants to crash here a few hours.

Terrible about her father, isn't it?

FRANK

I better just go in and see her.

COATES

I call this the Oasis. Refuge from

the world out there. Did you know

two people were shot in this building

last week?

COATES (CONT'D)

Careful. That's the Tiger. The lady's

down the hall. Welcome to Sunrise

Enterprises, Frank, the stress-free

factory.

FRANK

Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.

MARY

(groggy)

No, no.

COATES

She wanted something to help her

sleep.

FRANK

Mary, we really have to go.

COATES

Frank, she's suffered enough. She's

okay, I promise.

(puts hand on Frank's

shoulder)

C'mon, Frank.

COATES (CONT'D)

I'm always interested in people in

stressful occupations and being a

paramedic is about as stressful as I

can imagine. Here, sit down. What's

it like? Tell me some war stories.

FRANK

(sits)

Got a beer?

COATES

That shit is poison, Frank. We don't

drink alcohol here. What you need is

one of these.

FRANK

Did you give Mary something called

Red Death?

COATES

Red Death?

(passes joint to Kanita)

Tell me something, Frank--does killing

your clients make good business sense

to you? The kids selling that shit

have no sense. They'll be taken care

of, don't worry about that.

FRANK

I should be going. I just quit.

COATES

Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.

(offers white pill)

You take one of these, sleep two

hours, that's all you need.

(Frank hesitates)

Why do you think I'm telling you

this, Frank--for my health?  You

ought to look at yourself in the

mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass

of water.

FRANK

Is this what you gave Mary?

COATES

That's the stuff. I call it the Red

Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.

COATES (CONT'D)

Frank, I'm trying to help you.  Drink

up.

FRANK

I guess I'll be going.

COATES

Just take it easy.

KANITA

Take my pulse.

(he does)

It's good, isn't it?

FRANK

Perfect.

KANITA

I knew it. I was wrong about you.

You're not so bad.

CUT TO:

LARRY

You're in the stomach!

FRANK

You sure?

ROSE

Rose!

FRANK

Huh?

ROSE

My name. Rose.

LARRY

You're in the stomach, man.

LARRY (CONT'D)

You're in the stomach! Let me try.

FRANK

One more time!

LARRY

Stomach again.

FRANK

No way!

CUT TO:

COATES

Frank, take it easy. what happened?

KANITA

He flipped out.

COATES

Be cool, man. You're having a

paradoxical reaction. It can happen.

(to Kanita)

Didn't I tell you this guy was

stressed out?

KANITA

Stressed? He's psycho.

COATES

Frank, where you going?

COATES (CONT'D)

You're making a mistake. Sit down

and relax a minute.

COATES (CONT'D)

(calling)

She'll be back. And, by the way, you

owe me ten bucks.

CUT TO:

MARY

I can walk.

CUT TO:

MARY

Let go of me.

(he relaxes)

You shouldn't have come up. I told

you not to. You could have gotten us

both killed.

MARY (CONT'D)

You and CY have a nice talk? He tell

you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping

people? Well, I've seen him hurt

people. Why are you following me?

FRANK

Because you can barely walk.

MARY

You remember Noel, from the other

night, how Noel is now? He wasn't

always like that. He was my brother's

best friend. Cy or Tiger or one of

those other goons put a bullet in

Noel's head. He was in a coma three

months. Crazy ever since.

MARY (CONT'D)

This is my place.

CUT TO:

MARY

What is it? You want to help me, you

feel sorry for me? Keep it to

yourself.

FRANK

I need to sit down a minute.

MARY

Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone

else has.

MARY (CONT'D)

I've been clean two years now. I got

a job. I paint when I'm home. Don't

bother anybody. Then all this shit

happens.

MARY (CONT'D)

Oh no you don't. You can't stay here.

FADE OUT:

FRANK

Hello, I'm Frank. Mary's friend. A

very close friend who loves animals.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Hello?

FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I washed my face with three kinds of

soap, each smelling like a different

season. It felt good to be in a

woman's room again, especially a

woman who wasn't comatose or severely

disabled. I felt that perhaps I had

turned a corner, like I saved someone,

though I didn't know who.

CUT TO:

CAPT. BARNEY

You're late, Pierce. I know, but I

can't fire you. I've got nobody to

work sixteen XRay with Walls.

FRANK

No ...

CAPT. BARNEY

I got some forms here to fill out

about that accident when you get the

time.

(hands him keys)

I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.

FRANK

What if there is no tomorrow?

CAPT. BARNEY

Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before

I give you a big hug.

(to Miss Williams)

I love this guy.

CUT TO:

WALLS

Frank, what do you know. It's you

and me again tonight, the Rough

Riders, tearing up the streets just

like old times.

(kicks the front tire)

This old bus is a warrior, Frank,

just like us. I have tried to kill

him and he will not die. I have a

great respect for that.

CUT TO:

GRISS

Don't make me take off my sunglasses.

FRANK

Morning, Griss.

NURSE CONSTANCE

We're full up tonight, Frank.

Burke's voice speaks

in Frank's head:

BURKE'S VOICE

Go to the bank, boy, take out

everything you can.

FRANK

Mr. Burke?

BURKE'S VOICE

I'm going. I've had enough.

FRANK

You do it.

MILAGROS

Can't reach. You're taller.

BURKE'S VOICE

Don't do it.

FRANK

I thought he was getting better.

MILAGROS

Technically, yeah. I suppose. It

doesn't matter.

FRANK

Why not?

MILAGROS

Tha family wants us to do everything

to save him--so, that's it. They

want to keep him alive, they want to

believe in miracles, we keep him

alive. Shock him, Frank. He'll come

back. He always comes back.

FRANK

(takes paddles)

Clear!

BURKE'S VOICE

Ow!

BURKE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

You son of a bitch.

MILAGROS

Should I increase the lidocaine?

CUT TO:

WALLS

Frank, what you doing back there?

FRANK

I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.

(injects himself)

Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an

amp of glucose and a drop of

adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but

all I got.

WALLS

Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling

in the streets.

FRANK

(pulls off mask)

These are hard times, Tom.

WALLS

Yeah. Great, isn't it?

FRANK

Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing

me.

WALLS

Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's

gonna run tonight. I can feel it.

Our mission: to save lives.

FRANK

Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot

of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.

WALLS

Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.

FRANK

The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe

we should go back to the hospital.

WALLS

Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care

of you. Put your head out the window,

get some of that summer air. Listen

to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale.

Pronto.

DISPATCHER

Okay, units, it's suicide hour.

Fourteen Boy, I show you in the

hospital sixty minutes but I know

you're in the diner on 14th. Put

down the burger, I got a call for

you around the corner, 14 and 3rd, a

man with a noose around his neck and

nothing to hang it on. Sixteen XRay,

don't even think about getting coffee,

I have a call for you too.

WALLS

(on radio)

Sixteen XTerminator here. We like

our coffee bloody. Make it good--my

partner's dying to help someone.

DISPATCHER

You're in luck, X: your patient awaits

you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C

and Fourth.

FRANK

Tom, where are the Band-aids? This

is an ambulance, isn't it?

WALLS

(hitting the gas)

Look out!

CUT TO:

WALLS

What the hell's going on?

DRUNK #1

You've gotta take him to the hospital.

He tried to kill himself. Show him

your wrist. Show A.

DRUNK #1 (CONT'D)

See, he ain't right.

WALLS

Hold it. I will not take anyone

anywhere against his will. This is

America. People have rights.

DRUNK #2

He was bleeding before. He kept

spilling his beer. I gave him mouth-

to-mouth.

WALLS

You're lucky you didn't kill him.

(to Cut Wrists)

We're going to hear it straight from

the loony's mouth. Are you crazy?

Did you try to bump yourself off?

CUT WRISTS

(salivatory)

Yesssss.

WALLS

Why didn't you say so.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Sir, I am going to give you some

medicine that is still very

experimental. It's from NASA, and

although the astronauts have been

using it for years, we are the first

service to try it. I will put this

patch on your forehead like this,

and in about a minute you will have

to relax.

(places patch)

You will forget all your suicidal

feelings. It's very important that

you wear this for a least twenty-

four hours and keep checking the

mirror. If the patch turns green you

have to see the doctor immediately.

The side effects could be fatal.

FRANK

This is the worst suicide attempt

I've ever seen. You feel the pulse?

Here. That's where you cut, and it's

not across, it's down like so.

(takes out his knife)

Here take it.

CUT WRISTS

(shaking)

I can't.

FRANK

With all the poor people of this

city who wanted only to live and

were viciously murdered, you have

the nerve to sit here waiting to die

and not go through with it. You make

me sick. Take it.

WALLS

We cured him, Frank. When we work

together there's nothing we can't

fix.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WALLS

(sits)

Sounds like they're trying to clean

up the bus terminal tonight,

WALLS (CONT'D)

Hello, hello. Major Tom to Frank,

time to come home.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Where you going?

FRANK

C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.

CUT TO:

WALLS

Whatja doing?

FRANK

I feel the need, the need for speed.

I'm driving out of myself.

WALLS

The brakes are shot.

FRANK

I've taken that into consideration.

WALLS

You okay?

FRANK

I never felt better in my life.

DISPATCHER

Sixteen XRay, XRay.

FRANK

(keys radio)

X.

DISPATCHER

First of all, I want you to know how

sorry I am about this. I've always

liked you two. A unit above none, a

legend in its own lunchtime, so it

hurts me deeply to do this but I

have no choice. You must go to Second

and St. Marks. In front of a liquor

store you'll find a forty year-old

male, unconscious, lying next to his

wheelchair. Do I have to say more?

FRANK

(to radio)

You've said too much already.

WALLS

Mr. Oh.

FRANK

It's early for him.

WALLS

That's all right, we're not meant to

do Oh tonight. Something is going to

happen. I can feel it.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Bingo.

(keys police walkie)

EMS to Central. What was that call?

POLICE DISPATCH

A jumper. Stuyvesant Town.

WALLS

Ten-four.   One minute out.

DISPATCHER

Sixteen, Sixteen XRay. Level One

Emergency.

CUT TO:

WALLS

Whadda we bring?

FRANK

Better bring it all.

CUT TO:

FRANK

The elevator's fucked. We'd never

all fit anyway. Let's go.

FIREMAN

That's thirteen flights.

WALLS

The news guys just pulled up.

POLICE SERGEANT

The stairs, men, the stairs.

WALLS

This guy a jumper?

COP

We got a call for shots fired on

the sixteenth floor. The jumper

called right after.

FRANK

(to Walls)

I'm going to sixteen.

CUT TO:

COP

That's it, nobody else home.

FRANK

I'm going to thirteen.

CUT TO:

WALLS

Get this, Frank--we got two patients.

Number one, the scarecrow outside.

Number two misses the railing but

breaks both legs on the balcony,

then throws himself through a glass

window, heads to the bedroom, where

he's now passed out.

FRANK

(about Coates)

Well, he's the steakhead of the night,

then.

WALLS

I don't think the fire people can

touch him out there.

FRANK

How's he doing?

WALLS

I haven't had a chance to see him

yet. I'm going to take care of

sleeping beauty.

FRANK

Does that hurt?

COATES

(screams)

No!

FRANK

I don't think you've hurt any major

organs.

(sets IV line)

We got to get you off this thing

without setting off bleeding.

FRANK (CONT'D)

They're gonna torch the fence. You're

gonna feel the metal getting warm,

maybe very warm.

COATES

I can't hold up my head anymore.

COATES (CONT'D)

So, Frank, am I going to live?

FRANK

You're going to live.

COATES

I've been thinking about things.

Meditating on my financial future.

You guys gave me plenty of time to

meditate on the future. Whatja do,

stop for Chinese on the way over?

There's plenty of food in my place.

FRANK

I was tired. I needed a coffee.

COATES

What about Kanita?

FRANK

Dead.

COATES

That's too bad. Get some money, a

nice looking girl on your arm, and

everyone wants to take a piece. Some

kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes

is in my house, shooting at me. Damn,

I thought I could make it onto the

balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's

why, falls faster. I'm trying to

watch my weight, and look what

happens. Am I shot, Frank?

FRANK

No.

COATES

Boy can't shoot for shit, either.

Goddamn that's hot.

COATES (CONT'D)

Isn't it beautiful? When the fires

start to fall, then the strongest

rule it all. I love this city.

COP

(to Frank)

Good thing we buckled you in, huh?

COATES

What about me? Who's supposed to

buckle me?

COP

(to 2nd cop)

I thought you did.

2ND COP

I thought

you

did.

COP

(to Coates)

I'm so sorry, sir.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HAZMAT

Nurse Crupp, we're going to need

some Valium here. He's waking up

again.

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

(urgent)

Where's that Valium?

BURKE'S VOICE

Don't. Don't do it.

HAZMAT

Give me a hand, Frank. I've got to

get something between those teeth.

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

You can't believe how much he's

improved.

FRANK

How many times have you shocked him

tonight?

HAZMAT

Fourteen. We finally got him a room

upstairs. Should be up there in a

couple of hours.

FRANK

What do you do, just have someone

follow him around with a defribilator?

HAZMAT

(laughs)

That's good, Frank. No, but they

might surgically implant one, about

the size of my thumb. It goes near

the shoulder here, with two electrodes

connected to the heart. It sends a

shock whenever it senses a drop in

blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?

FRANK

A medical miracle.

CUT TO:

MARY

Everyone, this is the medic who

brought my father in. Frank, these

are some of my father's friends.

FAMILY FRIEND

We live out an the Island now, but

we used to live right down the block

from Pat. He was like a saint to us.

Came as soon as we heard.

FRANK

(to Mary)

I'm going out for a smoke.

CUT TO:

MARY

I heard CY Coates was brought in. He

looked pretty bad.

FRANK

He'll be all right.

MARY

Too bad. He called me up today, can

you believe that? I don't know how

he got my number. He asks me do I

want to come over and see him, I

tell him I'd rather go to a leper

colony. He says there's a new gang

that wants to kill him, take over

the business. I told him I hope he's

right. That they kill him. That's

what I told him.

FRANK

It'll be a while before he's up and

running again.

MARY

OK, last night I was weak. it won't

happen again. And all that shit I

said--it was just because I was

stoned. Forget it.

FRANK

No problem. Thanks for letting me

crash. It was the best sleep I've

had in months. I used some of your

soap.

MARY

I wish these people would leave

already. I can't listen to another

story. Did you see him?

(Frank doesn't answer)

That doctor says the brain is coming

around. They're waiting for the heart

to stabilize. I don't know who to

believe. He says they still have to

keep him tied up.

FRANK

Can I bring you something back to

eat--a falafal, some pizza?

MARY

No, we just ate. I only remember how

tough my father was. Now I know he

had to be like that, to make us tough.

This city'll kill you if you aren't

strong enough.

FRANK

No, the city doesn't discriminate.

It gets everybody.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I gotta go. Another call.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We're all dying, Mary Burke.

MARY

This is not a good time.

FRANK

There's no time.

CUT TO:

WALLS

Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug

shooting while you were dicking around

in there. There's gonna be trauma

tonight!

FRANK

As long as we keep moving. No standing

still.

WALLS

(keys mike)

C'mon, look at your screen. Give up

some blood!

DISPATCHER

Sixteen XRay, a man at the bus

terminal shot three years ago says

his arm hurts.

FRANK

C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.

WALLS

You want some bum in the bus terminal?

We'll wait for a real call.

FRANK

Let's get in a fight, then.

WALLS

Who with?

FRANK

That's your job. Just keep driving,

keep moving. No stopping. We're

sharks. We stop too long, we die.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Let's break something, Tom. Let's

bust something, bomb something.

WALLS

What do you want to break?

FRANK

(taking a drink)

I don't know--let's break some

windows.

WALLS

Why?

FRANK

Destruction, distraction. I feel the

need.

WALLS

You need a reason, Frank. You don't

just go around breaking people's

windows. That's anarchy.

FRANK

What's the reason? Give me a reason,

Tom.

WALLS

Let me think.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Classic cabbie move.

(to driver)

Hey, swammy, that's called a

crosswalk. You stop before it, not

on it!

WALLS (CONT'D)

I know who to work over. Him.

WALLS (CONT'D)

This guy's been terrorizing the

neighborhood for weeks, ever since

he got outta jail, wreaking general

havoc, contributing to the bad name

of the place. The term "menace to

society" was made up for him.

FRANK

He's crazy. He can't help it.

WALLS

(stops ambulance)

Well, why don't they put him away?

Prisons don't want him. I took him

to the hospital yesterday and here

he is again.

WALLS (CONT'D)

Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy

person. Every move is calculated. He

knows exactly what he's doing. This

is the guy. I've been after him for

weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat,

tough for one person, but with two

of us--

FRANK

Okay, whatta I do?

WALLS

If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll

get out here. You start talking to

him about baseball or something while

I sneak around behind and get down

and you push him. When he falls we

get him.

FRANK

That's ridiculous.

WALLS

Believe me, it always works. The

simpler, the better.

FRANK

You learn that in the army?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Flatbush.

FRANK (CONT'D)

That's a hell of a swing you got

there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry

in his prime.

NOEL

Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.

(heads for the next

car)

Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr.

October. Number three, game six,

World Series.

NOEL (CONT'D)

Here, you try.

FRANK

No, I'd better not.

NOEL

Sure, sure, give go.

FRANK

Yeah?

FRANK (CONT'D)

What the hell.

(spits into hands)

The next year, tiebreaker for the

division, in Boston, Yanks down two

to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the

plate.

NOEL

Oh man, Bucky.

FRANK

The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows

what's coming. He steps in, smash,

over the green monster.

WALLS

Frank, what the hell are you doing?

WALLS (CONT'D)

You go down those stairs there. Meet

me back here if you can't find him

in ten minutes. Call out if you see

him. Get with the program, Frank.

CUT TO:

Rose's voice

ROSE'S VOICE

Why did you kill me, Frank?

FRANK

I didn't mean to.

ROSE'S VOICE

You should have helped me.

FRANK

I tried to help. I wanted to.

ROSE'S VOICE

Don't you love me?

WALLS

I got him, Frank!

WALLS (CONT'D)

To the moon, Alice! You little

motherfucker!

FRANK

Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!

WALLS

Frank!

FRANK

Do it!

Frank!

FRANK

(to Noel)

We're gonna save you, Noel. You're

gonna be all right.

(to Walls)

Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking

backup, I swear!

WALLS

You're crazy.

Noel unconscious: Tom hurries down the alley toward the

ambulance as Frank opens Noel's mouth.

FRANK

You're going to make it! You're going

to make it!

Pressing Noel's chest, Frank lowers his mouth, starts CPR.

His mouth to Noel's. In the distance: Walls' footsteps

returning.

Last show of the night.

No.

He coded.

He's in V-fib. Shock him.

FLOOR NURSE

Clear!

HAZMAT

Zap him again.

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

Nothing. Get the cart, start

compressions, get an epinephrine in.

HAZMAT (CONT'D)

That's enough. I called it. Let's

get some coffee.

(to Frank)

You gonna tell the family?

CUT TO:

Die!

Frank.

MARY (O.S.)

Come on up.

FRANK

He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.

ROSE/MARY

How can that be? He was getting

better.

FRANK

He coded. They shocked him one too

many times. I'm sorry.

ROSE/MARY

He was tough. You did all you could.

FRANK

I'm sorry.

ROSE/MARY

You have to keep the body going until

the brain and heart recover enough

to go on their own.

ROSE/MARY (CONT'D)

Would you like to come in?

FRANK

Yes.
