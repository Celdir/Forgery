You want a ride into town?

SUELEEN

You bet.

SUELEEN

Got me an audition tonight.

WADE

Well, you just remember, if you

can't kick front, kick back, 'cause

at least you're kicking... Ten

minutes, okay?

SUELEEN

I've just been waiting for the

right spot to sing in... I'm so

nervous...

SUELEEN

I'm good, though. There ain't but

one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to

be conceited, but really it's true.

I've been taking special coaching

lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's

just wonderful. Teaches you how to

phrase; that's really important.

And breathing. Well, you know all

about that. Anyway, I wrote this

song.

SUELEEN

Oh, listen, I really do go on.

Here's your check. Sure has been

nice talking to you.

HAVEN

Who the hell is playing piano? Get

that hippie out of here... He's got

I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to

the airport. When you get my

about cutting this tune here.

10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

OPAL

Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting

together a film. I would like to

ask some questions.

HAVEN

Foreigner?

OPAL

I'm from BBC television.

I'm fine. This here is John

Hamilton.

HAVEN

Good to meet you.

(turns to BUD)

Bud, have them move the horses.

TRIPLETTE

Pleasure

REESE

Where is she?

HAVEN

Still inside the plane posing for

pictures and signing autographs.

She's got a new album cut again.

She'll be down in a minute. But

she'll be late for the Opera if she

doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on

the walkie-talkie.

BUD

They don't seem to be answering.

The ambulance boys are here, though.

Barnett always expects them to get

there like a shot. That thing only

goes a hundred fall bore with the

sirens going.

HAVEN

Thank you, Bud.

17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE

HAVEN

Bud, tell them to move the horses.

Promised this strip would be spic

REESE

Listen, we'll go get the car and

GREEN

Eater's been asking for you.

L.A. JOAN

Uh huh.

GREEN

She's been in the hospital two

weeks yesterday.

L.A. JOAN

You know anything about the

stations here?

GREEN

(hasn't heard)

It's hard to say. Doctors thought

she'd come home a week ago. All it

was was appendix.

L.A. JOAN

All they got is advertisements.

Just like L.A.

GREEN

Did an exploratory and according to

them, she needed an overhaul.

L.A. JOAN

Well, I could use one, especially

if I'm pregnant.

GREEN

What did you say?

L.A. JOAN

I said, maybe I'll change my name

again.

GREEN

I see... Well, those doctors are

real miracle workers.

L.A. JOAN

But not unless Nashville really

inspires me.

GREEN

Maybe you can look after me a

little.

29	INT. HAVEN'S JEEP

PEARL

We had these two city boys come in

last week. One or them said his

Ford truck had cut off his foot.

The other one said that wasn't true.

Then the first said he looked just

like Eddie Black when he said

that...

HAVEN

Bud, would you be sure to get the

oil changed?

BUD

Ya... where do you want me to take

it?

PEARL

Do you remember Eddie Black? He had

those blue eyes.

HAVEN

Where you always take it. There's

nothing special about this time.

PEARL

And they started pounding on each

other. But the one without the foot

was strongest.

HAVEN

Bud, you're going to have to show

up at the hospital tar me I gotta

get back to that session.

BUD

Okay. Anything you want me to say?

HAVEN

Say I had to get back to the

session. ~ God -- All school did

for you, you can put in a thimble.

PEARL

The cops came through and broke it

up. I finally just had to call Chet

and say, 'Chet, get over here. There

are two old bays here breaking up

the furniture...'

30	INT. WADE'S CAR-TRUCK

WADE

Is that what you're going to sing?

SUELEEN

No -- That's exercises. My coach

says you have to do exercise because

the vocal chords are muscle and need

to be stretched. Every time you

stretch them, the middle part sets

stronger. That's the place where I

sing.

WADE

You think I got any kind of a

voice?

SUELEEN

You sure do it loud.

WADE

Is that good?

SUELEEN

It's not bad.

WADE

You think I should take lessons?

SUELEEN

If you're serious. Being serious

is real important.

WADE

You serious?

SUELEEN

Wade -- I've been working toward

this audition for years.

WADE

Well, honey, I sure hope it comes

your way then.

SUELEEN

You think it will?

WADE

Sure thing.

31	INT. STEWS' CAR

TOM

(laughing)

Too long.

STEW #3

Is your rather really an actor?

TOM

(laughing)

All his life.

STEW #3

Really?

TOM

Me, too.

TOM

You having any fun?

TOM

That's the most important thing --

to have -- fun

STEW #2

How long are you going to be here?

TOM

Long enough to have fun.

32	INT. CADILLAC

TRIPLETTE

What do you think of him?

REESE

Hal? Well, Hal and I have been

friends for a long time.

TRIPLETTE

You go to school together?

REESE

No, we never did that

TRIPLETTE

Oh --

REESE

We're connected by a relative. One

time, one of his aunts married one

of my uncles. That was a long time

ago, though. How'd you come to work

for him?

TRIPLETTE

Well, I really think he's got a

chance.

REESE

You do?

TRIPLETTE

Oh yea -- There has never been a

better time for something new.

REESE

He ain't really new.

TRIPLETTE

He is to a lot of people.

REESE

He was a good Judge, but that was a

long time ago.

TRIPLETTE

You know, I'll bet you he makes it

with a majority.

REESE

Where are you from?

TRIPLETTE

Southern California.

REESE

You always live there?

TRIPLETTE

Spent time in Arizona. Why?

REESE

Well, I admire your optimism, and I

just wondered if it was regional.

You ever see any movie stars?

TRIPLETTE

I know a couple.

REESE

No kidding -- Wait till I tell

Linnea. Who?

TRIPLETTE

Ah... Peter Finch.

REESE

Who?

TRIPLETTE

Peter Finch -- he's English.

REESE

I never heard of him. Name

somebody else.

TRIPLETTE

Ryan O'Neal.

REESE

You really do?  ~ God -- How come

you know them?

TRIPLETTE

Oh, you meet them at parties and

stuff.

REESE

I'll be damned. Boy, if you could

get Ryan to say something about Hal

Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be

something?

TRIPLETTE

Well -- maybe. Let's see what

happens here.

REESE

I'll be dammed.

OPAL

Have your children been deaf since

birth?

LINNEA

Yes -- yes, they have. It was a

real shock at first, especially

since my daddy's a preacher, but

Delbert and I have been blessed by

their being here.

OPAL

When did you start singing?

LINNEA

When I was little, in church.

OPAL

Isn't it unusual for you to be

working with a black choir?

LINNEA

Yes, it is --

OPAL

Well, can you tell me why?

LINNEA

It just is.

OPAL

(not getting the

answer she wants)

How long have you been with them?

LINNEA

About three years.

OPAL

And before?

LINNEA

Just my church and my boys. We all

had to go to school and learn hand

talking. I just thank the Lord they

can see.

OPAL

Do you ever do any writing?

LINNEA

No, I don't.

OPAL

Are you a close friend of Haven's?

LINNEA

No, mostly his wife's. She's in

Paris, France, right now. My

husband Delbert is real friendly

with him. Delbert's in law. Does

work for him.

OPAL

Do you like him?

LINNEA

He's a member of our congregation.

lost it.

ALBUQUERQUE

Well, that just happened that time.

STAR

Well, it better not happen again.

STAR

You lost twenty-five dollars once

before that, too, near Christmas

time -- I remember that real well

now. December 9th, to be exact.

ALBUQUERQUE

You got a real good memory, Star.

STAR

I remember when I just saw you.

Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were

skinny.

ALBUQUERQUE

(ignoring him)

What do you have to buy?

STAR

Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get

something for the kids.

ALBUQUERQUE

Okay by me - I'd sure like to see

that Opryland.

Grand Old Opera --

STAR

I hate that music.

DOCTOR

Barbara, I'd like to talk to you

and Barnett alone.

BARNETT

Anything you say.

BARNETT

Doctor says you'll have to go on

out now

TRIPLETTE

Excuse me, Barnett, how's she

doing?

TRIPLETTE

I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you.

I'm John Triplette... a friend of

Del Reese... I was at the airport.

I just wanted to introduce myself.

I'm a great fan of hers. If there's

anything you need, just give me a

call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

BARNETT

She's going to rest now.

TRIPLETTE

Okay, I just wanted to see if I

could help out at all.

BARNETT

I appreciate your concern, but she

has to rest, so you can go on home.

TRIPLETTE

Oh, sure.

BARNETT

What do you really want?

TRIPLETTE

Not a thing, Barnett, really. I

need a little information. But, ah,

it can wait.

BARNETT

You bet.

TRIPLETTE

Okay. Thanks.

DOCTOR

Well, it's exhaustion, pure and

simple, and you're going to have to

take a rest or you're going to be in

big trouble.

BARNETT

She has to be at the opera tomorrow

night and then she can go home.

DOCTOR

She's not going anywhere, Barnett.

This is precisely what I'm talking

about. She is collapsing. She

cannot go on without a rest or she

will have to stop altogether for a

long time.

BARBARA JEAN

Well, I have to go:  It's too late

to be replaced, and, besides, I just

can't do that. Those people get

disappointed. They've come in from

all over, you know, and this Miss

Foxy who's been writing to me for

years is going to be there from

Michigan.

DOCTOR

You cannot leave this bed until I

say so. The two of you have to

understand that. Barnett, you've

got to stop this dovetailing and

give her some rest. You don't need

to make that much more money.

BARNETT

It's not the money. The friends

and neighbors love her and they want

to see her. We got a debt to the

public.

DOCTOR

Well, they are not going to see her

tomorrow night, and I suggest you

get on the phone and make the

necessary arrangements.

box.

OPAL

Did it break?

TOM

Dent it a little. Boy -- just she

couldn1t even find it. She had a

SUELEEN

Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.

MANAGER

That's for sure. At the airport -

(looks at Kenny's

You're in music, I guess, aren't

you?  'Cause my niece sings most of

the day. That won't bother you,

will it?

GREEN

I didn't think it would. She's

calling herself L.A. Joan this-

week. Last week it was Dakota.

Guess if you have to change your

name a state's as good as anything.

KENNY

She sure sings nice.

GREEN

My wife and I think so, but we're

family. Your family's always good

or bad depending on how you look at

your family. What do you do, pick or

sing?

KENNY

Oh... a little of both. Just

thought I'd look around at Nashville

for a while.

GREEN

When you run out or money, 'cause

you will here, you can go sing at

Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the

hat. All these kids do that. Most

every place doesn't want to bother

with you.

KENNY

I'm not really a musician.

Well, don't be shy. I got the

address here. Anytime you need it.

Room's twenty-five dollar! a week

We want to send special wishes to

Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist

Hospital. She collapsed yesterday

morning at the plane christening.

Send your prayers and letters to

Baptist Hospital, Nashville,

Tennessee. Barnett said she wept

because she couldn't be here with

you friends and neighbors. But your

faith in the great Almighty will

bring her back here just to be what

you want her to be... And her good

friend, Connie White, has given up

some time with her own mother, who

is sick with a kidney disorder, to

fill in and send her warmth to you

wonderful friends and neighbors so

you won't be too disappointed after

this message from teeth-sticken,

good, gooey clusters.

fanfare and you can sing and take

off your clothes or not sing. It

really doesn't make much difference,

really. But since you've never done

this before, singing might help.

BARNETT

Well, for heaven's sake. You're

just about everywhere, aren't you?

BARNETT

I think I should tell you I know

why you're here. The answer is no

... we don't get involved in

politics.

TRIPLETTE

(laughs good-

naturedly)

Well, that's not entirely true,

Barnett. At least not according to

Haven.

BARNETT

Haven? Hell,' we've been playing

poker together since we were

fourteen.

TRIPLETTE

I guess that's why he thought you

right want to help out.

BARNETT

He knows better.

TRIPLETTE

Well, it's probably because it

would help him.

BARNETT

How is that?

TRIPLETTE

Everybody likes to be as good as

their word.

BARNETT

Whose word?

TRIPLETTE

His Word.

BARNETT

His word? Are you telling me Haven

promised you something?

TRIPLETTE

That's pretty close. He's going to

be on the bill. Why not put Barbara

Jean on with him?

BARBARA JEAN

You're so good.

183	EXT. BUS - DAY

BARNETT

She's fine now, folks. Just too

soon after the hospital, I guess.

(he pauses)

She won't be able to continue and

she's in the bus crying her eyes

out, because she doesn't want to

disappoint the people who love her

the most.

TRIPLETTE

Come on, come on. You don't want

to waste your energy on that fool.

184	NEW ANGLE

GLENN

She's frail. You never saw anybody

so frail. I've seen her breathe hard

just standing still, dammit. You're

selfish. Worst selfish I've ever

heard. What if she died?  Would you

like that?  You'd probably say she

faked it so they could make money.

Well, you're just dumb.

185	NEW ANGLE

TRIPLETTE

We could invite them to the park.

BARNETT

What?

TRIPLETTE

They can come to the concert in the

park.

BARNETT

I said 'no!'

BARNETT

(to crowd)

We're very Sorry... Please... If

you'll listen.

(he makes the

decision)

You can see her tomorrow at Percy

Warner Park...

BARNETT

Triplette, I want to talk to you.

BARNETT

I got trapped and you know it, so

let's have some rules.

TRIPLETTE

Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I

understand your position.

BARNETT

No, you don't, so don't say you do.

Bunch of damn liars. What do you

get out or this?

TRIPLETTE

Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

BARNETT

Your job, huh.

BARNETT

She will not appear on the stage or

support that Walker guy and you

can't have any of his signs up while

she sings. She'll be on first and

out of the park before he shows up.

There will be no pictures, no

questions, no answers or tying her

name up with his now or in the

future to come. Any money she makes

will go to the President of the

United States.

BARNETT

We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send

her three songs over this afternoon.

She'll be done about ten minutes

after she starts and Walker better

not show up till she's through. Now,

get out of here.

MAN

Barnett?

BARNETT

(sharply)

What?

MAN

Well, Barnett, I have this terrific

song I've been working on. It would

be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like

you to take a look at it.

BARNETT

I'm very busy right now.

(to secretary)

Get me Haven.

MAN

It'll just take a minute. Here,

I'll even hold it for you.

BARNETT

I don't know where you got this,

but something tells me you stole it

and I hate thieves.

BARNETT

Aren't you an engineer...?  I know

you -- Don't you work at one of

those cut a record places...?

Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it?

Usually their last twenty-five...
