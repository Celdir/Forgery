THE ORCHID THIEF

Second Draft

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My

toenails have turned strange. I am

repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know

for I suffer from a condition called Body

Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but am I

as fat as I think? My therapist says no,

but people lie. I believe others call me

Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or,

facetiously, Slim. But I also believe

this is simply my own perverted form of

self-aggrandizement, that no one really

talks about me at all. What possible

interest is an old, bald, fat man to

anyone? I am repulsive. I have never

lived. I blame myself. I --

BRITISH NARRATOR

As natural selection works solely by and

for the good of each being, all corporeal

and mental endowments will tend to

progress towards perfection.

BRITISH NARRATOR

It is interesting to contemplate an

entangled bank, clothed with many plants

of many kinds, with birds singing...

RUSSELL

Laroche is asleep at the wheel.

RANDY

Crazy White Man is now Drowsy White Man.

ORLEAN (O.S.)

(wistful)

John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a

stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and

sharply handsome despite the fact that he

is missing all his front teeth.

(CONTINUED)

3.

ORLEAN

Two years ago I went to Florida to meet

Laroche after reading a small article

about a white man and three Seminole men

arrested with rare orchids they'd stolen

out of a place called the...

TONY

We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the

swamp. I'm on Janes Scenic Drive just

east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat,

Indians in the swamp.

TONY (cont'd)

Indians in the swamp.

RADIO VOICE

I don't know what you want me to say.

TONY

Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks.

If there are Indians in the swamp, they

are in there for a reason.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I'm old.   I'm bald. I'm repulsive.

VALERIE

We think you're just great.

(CONTINUED)

4.

KAUFMAN

(with studied modesty)

Oh, thank you.

VALERIE

And we're thrilled you're interested.

KAUFMAN

Oh, thanks, wow. That's nice to hear.

VALERIE

You have a really unique voice.

KAUFMAN

Well, thanks. That's... I appreciate

that.

VALERIE

Very talented. Really.

KAUFMAN

Thanks.   Thank you.   Thanks.

VALERIE

(looking up)

So --

KAUFMAN

Sort of hot in here.

VALERIE

(kindly)

Yeah, it is a bit. So, why don't you

tell me your thoughts on this crazy

little project of ours.

KAUFMAN

First, I think it's a great book.

(CONTINUED)

5.

VALERIE

Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?

KAUFMAN

And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating.

Plus her musings on Florida, orchid

poaching. Indians. Great, sprawling New

Yorker stuff. I'd want to remain true to

that, let the movie exist rather than be

artificially plot driven.

VALERIE

Okay, great, great. I guess I'm not

exactly sure what that means.

KAUFMAN

Oh. Well... I'm not sure exactly yet

either. So... y'know, it's...

VALERIE

Oh.    Okay.     Great.   So, um, what --

KAUFMAN

It's just, I don't want to compromise by

making it a Hollywood product. An orchid

heist movie. Or changing the orchids

into poppies and turning it into a movie

about drug running. Y'know?

VALERIE

Oh, of course. We agree.        Definitely.

KAUFMAN

Or cramming in sex, or car chases, or

guns. Or characters learning profound

life lessons. Or characters growing or

characters changing or characters

learning to like each other or characters

overcoming obstacles to succeed in the

end. Y'know? Movie shit.

VALERIE

See, we thought maybe Susan Orlean and

Laroche could fall in love during the

course of --

(CONTINUED)

6.

KAUFMAN

Alienated journalist writes about

passionate backwoods guy and he teaches

her to love. I mean, it didn't happen,

it wouldn't happen. It's Hollywood.

KAUFMAN

So anyway I just wanted to stop by to

congratulate you on your promotion.

MARGARET

Well, thanks again.   It's all so stupid.

KAUFMAN

I think it's great. Your photo in the

trades and everything. Pretty cool.

MARGARET

Anyway.    Yeah. So what's up with you?

KAUFMAN

I'm considering jobs. Mostly crap.

There's one you might like, about

flowers.

MARGARET

Flowers?   Really? What is it?

KAUFMAN

They want me to do an adaptation of a

book called The Orchid Thief.

MARGARET

Oh my God! You're kidding?    I read that!

I loved that book!

MARGARET (cont'd)

See, see, see! I'm not lying to you!

KAUFMAN

I loved the book.

(CONTINUED)

7.

MARGARET

Oh, Charlie, orchids are the most amazing

flowers. So complex.

KAUFMAN

I know.   They're really great.

MARGARET

You should take this job. Doesn't it

sound exciting, to immerse yourself in a

real subject and learn everything about

it? Blake wrote about seeing heaven in a

wild flower. And after you learn all

this stuff, you can teach me!

KAUFMAN

(thrilled but controlled)

That'd be fun.

MARGARET

God, they're such beautiful flowers.    And

so sexy. Y'know?

(whispering)

Did you know that orchid means --

KAUFMAN

Testicle.     I just read that.

MARGARET

(shrieks with delight)

Testicle! Can you believe it!

MARGARET (cont'd)

I swear, it'd be fucking great for

someone to have the testicles to make

that book into a movie, man. Instead of

this bullshit all the time. Something

not about sex and violence and car chases

and love stories, people learning

profound lessons. Jesus, isn't nature

enough?

(CONTINUED)

8.

LAROCHE

Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know

you fellas believe the world rests on the

back of a turtle? Not you fellas

specifically. Although, maybe you fellas

specifically. That I can't speak to.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Polyrrhiza Lindenii.

A ghost.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Cut it down, Russell.

KAUFMAN

...plus I love the idea of learning all

about orchids. I really admire those

guys who know everything about ants or

fungus or whatever. I'd like to be more

like that. See, I tend to write self-

involved, self-loathing... even

masturbatory stuff.

VALERIE

And it's wonderful, by the way.

KAUFMAN

Thanks. That's nice to hear. But I need

to challenge myself as a writer. I've

arrived at an age where I want to think

about the world in a different way.

VALERIE

Adapting someone else's work is certainly

an opportunity to think differently.

(CONTINUED)

9.

KAUFMAN

Yes. And I welcome the challenge of

taking a small subject, like orchids,

something that would never draw people

into a theater and making that

fascinating. I want to show people

heaven in a wildflower. As Blake wrote.

BOY

Any one at all, ma?

BOY (cont'd)

I want this then.

MOTHER

(hugging him)

A wonderful choice! And spiritually

significant! Did you know that Native

Americans believe the whole world rests

on the back of a turtle?

BOY

Cool!   I can't wait to tell the guys.

MARGARET

To a fucking awesome assignment, man.

KAUFMAN

Hey, I'm going to an orchid show Sunday?

For research? Maybe you'll come?

(CONTINUED)

10.

MARGARET

Absolutely. I think David, this guy I'm

seeing, would enjoy it, too. He's a real

naturalist. Okay if he comes along?

KAUFMAN

(covering heartbreak)

Yeah, of course. Sure.

MARGARET

He wants to meet you anyway.     All I do is

tell him how great you are.

KAUFMAN

Oh, thanks. That's nice to hear.

MARGARET

You'll like him. He's so honest and

smart. It's rare to find someone in this

town who thinks about things other than

this fucking business, y'know?

KAUFMAN

Yeah.     That's great.   He sounds great.

MARGARET

Like the other day we were in bed

discussing Hegel. Hegel! In bed! It

was fucking amazing. Have you read much?

KAUFMAN

Y'know, a long time ago.   A bit.   Y'know.

MARGARET

Well, anyway, David and I were discussing

his Philosophy of History and I was...

MARGARET (cont'd)

... struck by his notion that history is

a human construct...

KAUFMAN

Yeah.

MARGARET

... that nature doesn't exist

historically, but rather cyclically.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

11.

MARGARET (cont'd)

So whereas human history spirals forward,

building upon itself, nature...

RADIO VOICE

How's that Injun round-up going, Tony?

TONY

Fuck you, Barry, you fuckin'...

TONY (cont'd)

We got poachers.

(into the radio, pleased)

We got fuckin' poachers, Barry.   Ha!

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

The Victorian-era orchid hunter William

Arnold drowned on a collecting

expedition.

12.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Schroeder fell to his death.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Endres was shot dead in Rio Hacha.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Augustus Margary survived toothache,

rheumatism, pleurisy, and dysentery...

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

... only to be murdered when he completed

his mission and traveled beyond Bhamo.

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

Laroche loved orchids but I came to

believe he loved the difficulty and

fatality of getting them almost as much

as he loved the orchids themselves.

TONY

Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen

have in those pillowcases?

LAROCHE

Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

(CONTINUED)

13.

TONY

Okay, I'm asking then.

LAROCHE

Oh, Okay then! Let's see...

(peeking in bags)

Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia,

nine orchid varieties. About a hundred

and thirty plants all told, which my

colleagues have removed from the swamp.

TONY

You're aware that it's illegal to remove

plants or animals from state owned land?

LAROCHE

And don't forget these plants are all

endangered, sir. Every one of them.

TONY

Exactly. Well, that's exactly the issue.

This is a state preserve.

LAROCHE

Yes, sir, it is.

(afterthought)

Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole

Indians. Did I mention that? You're

familiar, I'm sure, with the State of

Florida v. James E. Billie.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

So you know that even though Seminole

Chief Billie killed a Florida panther,

one of, what, forty in the entire world?

LAROCHE (cont'd)

The state couldn't successfully prosecute

him. Because he's an Indian and it's his

right. As repugnant as you or I as white

conservationists might find his actions.

TONY

But --

(CONTINUED)

14.

LAROCHE

Not to mention the failed attempts on

three separate occasions to prosecute

Seminoles for poaching palm fronds,

which, I believe, they use to thatch the

roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

RUSSELL

He's right. That's exactly what we use

them for. Chickee huts.

RANDY

Yeah.

VINSON

Yeah.

RUSSELL

Yeah.

TONY

Yeah, but I don't... I can't let you

fellas go yet. Just hold on while I...

(into radio)

Hey, Barry, can I get some help? Barry?

ORLEAN

Nothing in Florida seems hard or

permanent. The developed places are just

little clearings in the jungle, but the

jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything

is always growing or expanding. At the

same time, the wilderness disappears

before your eyes.

(CONTINUED)

15.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am fat. I am repulsive.   I cannot bear

my own reflection.

DONALD

Did you open your present from mom yet?

KAUFMAN

What's with you?

DONALD

My back.

DONALD (cont'd)

Hey, Charles, you'll be glad, I have a

plan to get me out of your house pronto.

KAUFMAN

A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?

DONALD

(big build up)

I'm gonna be a screenwriter!   Like you!

DONALD (cont'd)

I know you think this is just one of my

get-rich-quick schemes. But I'm doing it

right this time. I'm taking a seminar!

16.

DONALD (O.S.)

It's only five hundred bucks!

KAUFMAN

(muffled by pillow)

Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

DONALD (O.S.)

In theory I agree with you. But this one

is highly regarded within the industry.

KAUFMAN

Donald, don't say "industry."

DONALD

I'm sorry, I forgot. Charles, this guy

knows screenwriting. People from all

over come to study his method. I'll pay

you back, man. As soon as I sell --

KAUFMAN

Let me explain something to you.

DONALD

Yeah, okay.

KAUFMAN

Anybody who says he's got "the answer" is

going to attract desperate people. Be it

in the world of religion --

DONALD

(indicating his back)

I just need to lie down while you explain

this to me. Sorry. I apologize.

(lies down, stares at ceiling)

Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Okay. Go.

KAUFMAN

There are no rules to follow, Donald, and

anybody who says there are, is just --

(CONTINUED)

17.

DONALD

Not rules, principles. McKee writes:

"A rule says, you must do it this way.   A

principle says, this works... and has

through all remembered time."

KAUFMAN

The script I'm starting, it's about

flowers. No one's ever done a movie

about flowers before. So, there're no

guidelines, and that's good because --

DONALD

What about Flowers for Algernon?

KAUFMAN

That's not about flowers.    And it's not a

movie.

DONALD

Oh, okay, I never saw it.    Go ahead.

KAUFMAN

My point is, those teachers are dangerous

if your goal is to do something new. And

a writer should always have that goal.

Writing is a journey into the unknown.

It's not building a model airplane.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Each being is, because posited, an op-

posited, a conditional and conditioning,

the Understanding completes these its

limitations by positing the opposite...

DONALD

McKee is a former Fulbright scholar. Are

you a former Fulbright scholar, Charles?

(CONTINUED)

18.

BOY

Turtles are of the order Testudine!

MOTHER

Really?    Testudine?

BOY

Yeah. And they're found on every

continent! Except Antarptica!

MOTHER

Antarctica. Every continent, huh?

BOY

Uh-huh. The turtle shell has remained

unchanged for two hundred million years!

And there's all different kinds, Pelusio

gabonensis, Phyrnops rufipes, Chitra

indica, Dermochelys coriacea coriacea...

LAROCHE

... and what we have here, my friend, is

... thirteen Encyclia Cochleata... four

Encyclia Tampensis --

MIKE OWEN

I'm sorry, Encyclia what?

LAROCHE

(pointing to each)

Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis.

(checks Owen's spelling)

Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum

Nocturnum. A very good haul. Two

Catopsi Floribunda. Three Polyrrhiza

Lindenii, the ghost orchid. What I

really came for. These sweeties grow

nowhere in the U.S. except in your swamp.

MIKE OWEN

That true? Boy, you really know your

plants, Mr. Laroche.

(CONTINUED)

19.

LAROCHE

Yeah. I do. I'm one of the world's

foremost experts. But that'll all be

revealed at the hearing.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient

family of perennial plants with...

DONALD (V.O.)

The most memorable, fascinating

characters tend to have not only a

conscious but an unconscious desire.

Although these characters are unaware of

their subconscious need...

KAUFMAN

Maybe you should watch what you eat,

Donald. Did you ever consider maybe

you're a bit fat? Does it ever occur to

you, you kind of represent me in the

world? That people look at you and

think, he's Charlie's twin, therefore

that's what Charlie must look like?

DONALD

By the way, mom's paying for the seminar.

KAUFMAN

Did you even hear what I said?

DONALD

Yeah. Anyway. I pitched mom my

screenplay --

KAUFMAN

Jesus, don't say "pitch."

DONALD

Sorry. Anyway, she loved my... telling

of my story to her. She said it's like

"Silence of the Lambs" meets "Psycho."

(CONTINUED)

20.

KAUFMAN

Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate.

I hear she's really good with structure.

DONALD

You think you're so superior, Charles.

Well, I'm really gonna write this. And

you'll see. And, and... you suck, okay?

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Florida is a landscape of transition...

DONALD (V.O.)

Do not proliferate characters; do not

multiply locations. Rather than

hopscotching through time, space, and

people, discipline yourself to a

reasonably contained cast and world...

ORLEAN

Florida is a landscape of transition and

mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and

orderliness, nature and artifice.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

We open on State Road 29. A lonely

stretch of road cutting through untamed

swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van

barrels around a curve. It's driver: a

skinny man with no front teeth...

(CONTINUED)

21.

LERNER

Finally, Mr. Laroche, what is your

experience in the area of horticulture?

LAROCHE

Okay, I've been a professional

horticulturist for twelve years. I've

owned a plant nursery of my own which was

destroyed by the hurricane. I'm a

professional plant lecturer. I've given

at least sixty lectures on the

cultivation of plants. I'm a published

author, both in magazine and book form.

I have extensive experience with orchids,

and the asexual micropropagation of

orchids under aseptic cultures.   This is

laboratory work, not at all like your

nursery work.

(grins)

I'm probably the smartest person I know.

LERNER

Thank you.

LAROCHE

You're very welcome.

KAUFMAN

What?!

DONALD

Look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what?

KAUFMAN

Go away.    God damn it.

(CONTINUED)

22.

DONALD

(lost)

Y'know, I'm just trying to do something.

DONALD (CONT'D)

Hey, thanks a lot, man. Cool.

(flicks on light, then in pitch

mode:)

Okay, there's this serial killer, right --

DONALD (CONT'D)

No, wait. See, he's being hunted by a

cop. And he's taunting the cop, right?

Sending clues who his next victim is.

He's already holding her hostage in his

creepy basement. So the cop gets

obsessed with figuring out her identity,

and in the process he falls in love with

her. Even though he's never even met

her. She becomes, like, the

unattainable, like the Holy Grail.

KAUFMAN

(through a blanket)

It's a little obvious, don't you think?

DONALD

Okay, but there's a twist. See, we find

out the killer suffers from multiple

personality disorder. Okay? See, he's

really also the cop and the girl. All of

them. It's all him! Isn't that crazy?

KAUFMAN

Look, the only idea more overused than

serial killers, is multiple personality.

On top of that you explore the notion

that cop and criminal are really two

aspects of the same person. See every

cop movie ever made for other examples of

this.

DONALD

Mom called it psychologically taut.

(CONTINUED)

23.

KAUFMAN

The other thing is, there's no way to

write this. Did you consider that? I

mean, how exactly would you show a

character holding himself hostage?

DONALD

Trick photography?

KAUFMAN

Okay, that's not what I'm asking. What

I'm asking is in the reality of this

movie, if there's only one character,

right?... Okay? How could you... What

exactly would the scene... How...

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

I agree with mom. Very taut. Sybil

meets.. I dunno, something very taut.

LAROCHE

They're gonna fucking crucify me.

BAXLEY

I'll go into the Fakahatchee with a

chainsaw. I swear to God.

LERNER

Buster, for crying out loud, I reminded

her the Indians used to own Fakahatchee.

Look, we'll deal with all this at trial.

ORLEAN

Mr. Laroche?

(CONTINUED)

24.

ORLEAN (CONT'D)

My name's Susan Orlean, I'm a writer for

the New Yorker. It's a maga --

LAROCHE

I'm familiar with the New Yorker. The

New Yorker, yes, the New Yorker. Right?

ORLEAN

Right. So I was interested in doing a

piece about your situation down here.

LAROCHE

Yeah? Put this in: I don't care what

goes on here. I'm right, and I'll take

this all the way to the Supreme Court.

That judge can screw herself.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

That for real would go in?

SENSUOUS FEMALE NARRATOR

The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient

family of perennial plants with one

fertile stamen and a three petalled

flower. In most orchid species, one petal

is enlarged into a lip and is the most

conspicuous part of the flower.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient...

ALICE

So what looks good today?

KAUFMAN

Um. Hi. Thank you. The key lime pie,

please. A small slice. I'm watching

my... And a coffee, please. Skim milk.

ALICE

(sees book)

Orchids! I absolutely love orchids.

KAUFMAN

Yes.   They're really great.

ALICE

So, I'll be right back with your pie.

ALICE

(I love you)

I absolutely love orchids.

(CONTINUED)

26.

ORLEAN

(to camera)

A few days after the hearing, Laroche

took me to an orchid show in Miami.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

Hi.   Thanks for picking --

LAROCHE

I want you to know this van is a piece of

shit. When I hit the jackpot, I'll buy

myself an awesome car, maybe an Aurora.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Sit on top of that. You won't hurt it.

LAROCHE

The thing you gotta know is my whole life

is looking for a goddamn profitable

plant. And that's the ghost.

ORLEAN

Why the ghost orchid?

LAROCHE

The sucker's rare. Collectors covet what

is not available. I'm the only one in

the world who knows how to cultivate it.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

The plan was, get the Indians to pull it

from the swamp. I researched it. As

long as I don't touch the plants, Florida

can't touch us.   Then I'd clone hundreds

of them babies in my lab, sell 'em, and

make the Seminoles a shitload of change.

(CONTINUED)

27.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

And I stop future poaching by making the

flowers readily available in stores.

Then I give a big speech at the trial

about how the legislature should get rid

of loopholes smart people like me can

find. I'm a hero. The flowers are

saved. Laroche and nature win.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Men from Florida dominated the orchid

hunting scene. Hunters in the

Fakahatchee hauled out thousands of

orchids in horse-drawn flatbed carts.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

A beautiful orange orchid blooms in time-

lapse --

28.

KAUFMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

The camera circles it, revealing how

lovely and perfect and sweet and inviting

and delicate and...

DONALD

Cool.

KAUFMAN

What do you want, Donald?

DONALD

Nothing. I just read about that Swamp

Ape that supposedly lives in the swamp?

Like bigfoot? You should put that in

your script, like, killing people or

something. That'd be very, very cool.

KAUFMAN

Why are you in here now?

DONALD

Nothing, I was just... Oh, one thing, I

need a cool way to kill people. Don't

worry! For my script! Ha ha!

KAUFMAN

Um, okay, killer's a literature professor

who cuts off little chunks of his

victims' bodies until they die. He'd be

known in the tabloids as "The

Deconstructionist."

DONALD

That's kinda good.   I like that.

KAUFMAN

See, I was kidding, Donald.

DONALD

Oh, okay. Sorry. You got me! Heh-heh.

Do you mind if I use it, though?

MOTHER

(praying softly)

For certain is death for the born/And

certain is birth for the dead/Therefore

MOTHER (CONT'D)

A slice of pie for my turtle expert?

BOY

Mom, there's something I feel I have to

do. I don't know how to do this, but I

feel in my stomach that I have to.

MOTHER

What do you have to do, honey?

BOY

Collect one of every turtle in the world.

(beat)

It's a long list, ma. Cuora

galbinifrons, Graptemys versa, Callagur

borneoensis, all the Galapagos species,

people think there's only one, but that's

hardly the case. Cycloderma frenatum,

Cuora pani...

(sighs)

I don't think my life is worth living if

I can't do this.

MOTHER

Well, we'd better get started, huh, baby?

(CONTINUED)

30.

ORLEAN

Wow, that's some story. So how many

turtles did you end up collecting?

LAROCHE

(matter-of-fact)

Oh, I lost interest right after that.

ORLEAN

Oh.

LAROCHE

I dropped turtles when I fell in love

with Ice Age fossils. Learned everything

about them. Collected the shit out of

'em. Fossils were the only thing made

any sense to me in this fucking world.

Y'know?

LAROCHE (CONT'D)

Then fossils were over when I found

lapidary, which I just adored.

ORLEAN

Okay, now what is lap --

LAROCHE

Ditched lapidary for resilvering old

mirrors. Did that with my mom for a

while. We had the largest collection of

19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet.

Perhaps you read about us. Mirror World

October '88? I have a copy somewhere...

ORLEAN

So, did you ever miss the turtles? The

only thing that made you ten year old

life worth living?

LAROCHE

I'll tell you a story. I once fell

deeply, profoundly in love with tropical

fish. I had sixty goddamn fish tanks in

my house. I'd skin-dive to find just the

right ones. Anisotremus virginicus,

Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon

capistratus. You name it. Then one day

I say, fuck fish. I renounce fish.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

31.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

I vow to never set foot in the ocean

again, that's how much fuck fish. That

was seventeen years ago and I have never

since stuck so much as a toe into that

ocean. And I love the ocean!

ORLEAN

(beat)

But why?

LAROCHE

(shrugs)

Done with fish.

THERAPIST

So --

KAUFMAN

I'm still obsessed with that girl.

THERAPIST

The Burger King girl? Dimples and sparkly

eyes?

KAUFMAN

California Pizza Kitchen.

THERAPIST

Oh.    Red hair and nice?   Likes orchids?

KAUFMAN

Yeah. She's really nice. I feel pretty

certain she likes me maybe.

THERAPIST

So do you think you'll talk to this one?

KAUFMAN

Hi!

ALICE

Hey!    Some key lime pie for ya today?

KAUFMAN

(thrilled she remembered)

Okay, yeah! That sounds great!     Yeah!

ALICE

I'll pick you out an extra large piece.

Preferred customer.

KAUFMAN

Thank you.     That's really sweet of you.

ALICE

Still reading about orchids, I hope.

KAUFMAN

Yes, I am, in fact!    Beautiful flowers.

ALICE

A friend of mine has a pretty little pink

one, grows right on a tree branch.

KAUFMAN

That's what's called an epiphyte.

ALICE

(pointing at him excitedly)

Right! Boy, you know your stuff, huh?

KAUFMAN

Not really. I'm just learning.

Epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not

parasites. They get all their

nourishment from the air and rain.

ALICE

Well, I'm impressed.    That's great.

KAUFMAN

There are more than thirty thousand kinds

of orchids in the world.

ALICE

Wow, that's a lot, huh? Okay, then, so

I'll be right back with a nice big slice

of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

(CONTINUED)

33.

KAUFMAN

But, so, anyway, I was also wondering...

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

I'm going up to this orchid show on

Saturday in Santa Barbara and I --

ALICE

Oh, um, well --

KAUFMAN

I'm sorry.     I apologize.   I'm sorry.

ALICE

(nodding)

So I'll be right back with your pie then.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am fat.     I am old. I am repulsive.

ORLEAN

There are more than thirty thousand known

orchid species. One species looks like a

German shepherd...

ORLEAN (V.O.)

... one looks like an onion, one looks

like an octopus. One looks...

(CONTINUED)

34.

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

... like a school teacher, one looks like

a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern

beauty queen, one looks like a New York

intellectual with whom you'd do the

Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed.

One looks like that girl in high school

with creamy skin. One has eyes that

dance. One has eyes that contain the

sadness of the world.

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

Nothing in science can account for the

way some people feel about orchids.

Those love them, love them madly.

TEENAGED LAROCHE

Encyclia tempensis. The butterfly.

MOTHER

"You will find something more in woods

than in books. Trees and stones will

teach you that which you can never learn

from masters." Saint Bernard said that.

TEENAGED LAROCHE

That's pretty, ma.

MOTHER

Diane would've loved this flower, Johnny.

TEENAGED LAROCHE

Maybe somehow she can see it.    Y'know?

MOTHER

(beat)

So... after this one how many, honey?

(CONTINUED)

35.

TEENAGED LAROCHE

Only one hundred and seventeen more.

MOTHER

And you have to have a photo of every

single type of orchid in Florida?

TEENAGED LAROCHE

I have to, ma. You know that.

KAUFMAN

I'm successful, right? I mean, I could

say to a woman, I'm a screenwriter and

she'd look at me differently. I could

get laid. But I want someone to like me.

For me. Y'know?    The way I like them.

The way I'd do anything for that woman

walking down the street. A million women

walking down the street. I don't need to

know what their jobs are. No one will

ever love me like that. Like I love

almost every woman I see.

LAROCHE

Once you get the sickness, it takes over

your life. I started out just

photographing 'em. Now look at me.

(dramatic pause)

It'll happen to you. You'll see.

ORLEAN

I don't think so.     I'm not prone to --

(CONTINUED)

36.

LAROCHE

Angraecum sesquipedale! Beauty! God!

Darwin wrote about this one. Charles

Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?

ORLEAN

(annoyed)

I know who Darwin is.

DARWIN (V.O.)

Therefore I should infer from analogy

that probably all the organic beings

which have ever lived on this earth have

descended from some one primordial form,

into which life was first breathed.

KAUFMAN

Okay, opening of movie. Four billion

years ago. Life has not begun. Endless,

barren terrain. Silence. Silence.

LAROCHE

See that nectary all the way down there?

Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose

twelve inches long to pollinate it.

Everyone thought he was a loon. Then,

sure enough, they found this moth with a

twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means

nose, by the way -- and --

(CONTINUED)

37.

ORLEAN

I know what proboscis means.

LAROCHE

Every one of these flowers has a specific

relationship with the insect that

pollinates it. There's an orchid that

looks exactly like this particular

insect. So the bug humps the flower and

gets covered with its pollen. Thusly...

ORLEAN

I get it.

LAROCHE

That's called pseudo-copulation. These

flowers are smart! You gotta fall in

love with them. Once you learn anything

about orchids, you'll devote your life to

learning everything about them.

ORLEAN

I wanted to want something as much as

people wanted these plants but it isn't

part of my constitution.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

I suppose I do have one unembarrassed

passion.

(beat, looks back at us)

I want to know how it feels to care about

something passionately.

38.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

... then, after the entire history of

life on the planet, in the last seconds

of the montage, we see the whole of human

history: tool-making, hunting, farming,

war, lust, religion, self-consciousness.

Yearning. Then, bam! cut to Susan Orlean

writing a book about orchids. And the

story begins. It's perfect! It's

circular! It's everything!

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

I'm an idiot. I'm fat. I hate my--

DONALD

McKee is a genius! And hilarious! He

just comes up with these great jokes, and

everyone laughs! But he's serious, too.

You'd love him. He's all for

originality, just like you! But he says,

we have to realize we all write in a

genre, so we must find originality within

that genre. See, it turns out there

hasn't been a new genre since Fellini

invented the mockumentary!

KAUFMAN

(sadly, quietly)

You and I share the same DNA. Is there

anything more lonely than that?

HUSBAND

You want to do something tonight?

(CONTINUED)

39.

ORLEAN

I should work. I've got stuff...

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Laroche is an optimist. That is, he sees

a profitable outcome in every situation.

When he was a young man he worked in

construction.

LAROCHE

(pleased with himself)

Asclepiadaceae. From thirty yards.   Yes.

LAROCHE

(laughing)

... I broke my back. Exactly how my dad

did. Isn't that a psycho coincidence?

(far away)

Y'know, the way I see it, we're a family

of ailments and pain.

(suddenly excited.)

But, anyway, it was a godsend.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Laroche once spilled toxic pesticide into

a cut on his hand. It resulted in

permanent heart and liver damage. Most

people would consider this a terrible

accident. Laroche considered it a

success...

40.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

... because he sold an article about it.

LAROCHE

I consider the broken back -- in three

places, by the way. I have x-rays --

(fishes through bag)

-- a stroke of goddamn luck. I got

disability, married the sweetest woman in

the world. And me and my lovely new wife

-- my now ex-wife, the bitch -- got to

open our nursery.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Movie opens with Susan Orlean typing.

(refers to Orchid Thief)

"John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a

stick...

(stops, flips through book)

Movie opens with a young boy picking out

his first pet...

(stops, flips through book)

Movie opens with...

41.

LAROCHE

People started coming out of the

woodwork, to ask me stuff, to admire my

plants, to admire me.

CUSTOMER #1

John, what is this? It's so beautiful.

LAROCHE

Catasetum tenebrosum. From Peru. It's

neat 'cause its dimorphic, which means...

CUSTOMER #2

Johnny baby!

LAROCHE

Henry! Look at that Dracula vampira!

It's gorgeous, man.

CUSTOMER #2

Take me in to the Fakahatchee. Show me a

ghost in bloom, and it's yours.

LAROCHE

Cool.

CUSTOMER #3

Mr. Laroche, would you be able to --

LAROCHE

Bromeliad Tree. Hey, Dora! Good, good.

Well, sure, you gotta watch the

temperature. Don't want an odontoglossum

above seventy-five. Uh-huh, that should

be fine. Yeah, damp it down. Oh, I'm

doing well. She's fine, too. Sure...

(CONTINUED)

42.

LAROCHE

I believe some folks'd call me up to talk

and just talk because they were lonely.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

You know why I love plants? Because

they're so mutable, so adaptable.

Adaptation is such a profound process.

(beat)

Adaptation means you figure out how to

survive in the world. People aren't too

good at that sometimes.

KAUFMAN

I don't know how to adapt this. I

should've just stuck with my own stuff.

I don't know why I thought I could --

JERRY

See her?   I fucked her up the ass.

JERRY

Just kidding. Hey, maybe I can help.

What's the problem, buddy?

KAUFMAN

It's about flowers.

JERRY

It's not only about flowers. It's got

that crazy plant nut guy. He's funny,

right?

KAUFMAN

"There is not nearly enough of him to

fill a book," blah blah blah, so Orlean

"digresses in long passes" blah blah blah

"no narrative really unites these

passages." Blah blah blah blah blah.

(looking up defiantly)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

43.

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

New York Times Book Review. I can't

structure this. It's that sprawling New

Yorker shit.

JERRY

Oh man.   I'd fuck her up the ass.

KAUFMAN

There's no story. The book has no story.

JERRY

So make one up. The book's a jumping off

point. No one in town can make up a

crazy story like you. You're the king.

KAUFMAN

I didn't want to do that this time. It's

someone else's material. I have a

responsibility... Anyway, I wanted to

grow as a writer, do something profound

and simple. Show people how amazing

flowers are.

JERRY

Are they amazing?

KAUFMAN

I don't know. I think they are.

JERRY

Look, what I tell a lot of guys is pick

another film and use it as a model. I

always thought this one could be like

Apocalypse Now. The journalist spends

the whole movie searching for the crazy

plant nut guy -- what's his name?

KAUFMAN

John Laroche.

JERRY

She has to travel deep into the darkest

swamps to find the mysterious "Laroche."

KAUFMAN

I need you to get me out of this.

JERRY

Charlie, at the end of the day, I think

it would be a terrible career move.

44.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Okay, okay, we open with Laroche. He's

funny. Okay, he says, okay, he says, I

love to mutate plants, he says, mutation

is fun... Okay, we show flowers and,

okay, we have to have the court case.

Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, I

was mutated as baby, that's why I'm so

smart...that's funny. Okay we open at

the beginning of time...no, okay, we open

with Laroche driving into the swamp...

ORLEAN (V.O.)

The pioneer-adventurers in Florida had to

travel inward, into a place as dark and

dense as steel wool. They had to

confront what a dark, dense, overabundant

place might have hidden in it.

LAROCHE

The nursery was going well, but sometimes

bad things happen. Darkness descends.

(CONTINUED)

45.

LAROCHE

Sure you don't want to come, dad?

UNCLE JIM

Nursery business good, Johnny?

LAROCHE

Everything's good, Uncle Jim. This last

year's been a dream, I'm telling you.

We're finally pulling out of this debt.

MOTHER

Amen, honey. Praise Allah, Buddha,

Vishnu. And all the rest of 'em.

46.

LAROCHE

She divorced me soon after she regained

consciousness. Then the hurricane

destroyed my greenhouse. Everything. I

knew it would break my heart to start

another nursery, so when the Seminoles

wanted a white guy, an expert, to get

their nursery going, I took it.

LAROCHE

But I wasn't gonna give them a

conventional little potted-plant place.

So I came up with the "ghost" plan.   I

was gonna give them something amazing.

KAUFMAN

... see, Laroche researched it and found

that Indians have the legal right to take

endangered plants off state lands.

WOMAN

What an amazing opening! So then it's a

courtroom drama. A Few Good Men! And

all those Indian rights issues are so

complex. There are valid arguments on

both sides. I mean we took their land!

We gave them smallpox!

KAUFMAN

Well, actually, there wasn't much of a

trial. Florida got 'em on a

technicality, about cutting down non-

endangered trees. Even the Indians

aren't allowed to do that. They all

plead no contest. Laroche got fined five

hundred bucks and banned from the

Fakahatchee for six months.

(CONTINUED)

47.

WOMAN

Oh, wow.      So, like, then what happens?

KAUFMAN

Nothing much. That's what I like. I

mean, most people's lives don't include a

lot of drama and I wanted to sort of be

compelling without having to resort to

big, um... Y'know what I mean?

WOMAN

(glancing distractedly around)

Absolutely. I absolutely do.

KAUFMAN

It's, like, Blake talked about seeing the

world in a grain of sand and heaven in a

wild flower. Y'know? Or like Hegel?

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am a failure. I'm a poseur. I have no

ideas. I wanted to do something great.

There's no story. I'm fat. I'm repuls--

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

What?

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

Charlie?   It's Valerie.

KAUFMAN

Oh, hi.    Hi. Hey!   Hi!

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

Sorry to bug you. We were just talking

about you, how excited we are.

KAUFMAN

Yeah, me too.

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

So it's coming along good?

(CONTINUED)

48.

KAUFMAN

It's good. It's complicated what I'm

trying to do, but it's going very well.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Yeah.

ORLEAN

Hello, John? It's Susan.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Susie-Q!

ORLEAN

So I was thinking it'd be good for the

article for me to go into the Fakahatchee

to see a ghost. Would you take me?

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

I'd love to, but, hey, I'm banned for the

next six months. Goddamn crucified me.

Get one of them monkey-suited rangers to

take you. 'Course, they wouldn't be able

to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a

tree and shoved itself up their ass.

Hey, put that in the article.

KAUFMAN

(calling off-screen)

Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald,

is a perfect metaphor for writing. I'm

stepping into the confusion of the

unknown. I'm taking the big risk here.

(CONTINUED)

49.

KAUFMAN

It's dark, dangerous, as dense as steel

wool. I don't know if I'll come out

alive, but if I do, I'll have something

true to give the world. That's the

difference between writing and aping some

moron's "principles."

DONALD

Hey, Charles, I'm thinking of putting a

song in. Y'know like when characters

sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance

around. I thought it might be a nice way

to break the tension. So, try to think

of a song about split personality...

ORLEAN

You would have to want something very

badly...

ORLEAN (V.O.)

... to go looking for it in the

Fakahatchee Strand.

KAUFMAN

Hey!    How was Denver?

STEWARDESS

Oh, God, sweetie, I'm so glad to be home.

STEWARDESS (cont'd)

Can I get you something to drink?

50.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

An early surveyor made this entry in his

field notes...

SURVEYOR (V.O.)

A pond surrounded by bay and cypress

swamp, impracticable. Full of monstrous

alligators, counted fifty and stopped.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Whatever isn't wet in the Fakahatchee is

blasted. The grass gets so dry that the

friction from a car can set it on fire,

and the burning grass can engulf the car

in flames. A 1940's botanist noted:

BOTANIST (V.O.)

Most impressed by the area's variety of

squirrels...

(CONTINUED)

51.

BOTANIST (cont'd)

... and charred automobiles.

ORLEAN

The swamp's darkness and denseness can

rattle your nerves. A sailor on a pluma-

collecting expedition wrote in his diary:

SAILOR (V.O.)

The place looked wild and lonely. About

three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's

nerves. We saw him crying, he could not

tell us why, he was just plain scared.

ORLEAN

The swampy part of the Fakahatchee is hot

and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth

snakes and diamond back rattlers and...

(CONTINUED)

52.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

... alligators and snapping turtles and

poisonous plants and wild hogs and...

MIKE OWEN

Charlie?

KAUFMAN

(tremulous)

Yes. Hi.

MIKE OWEN

So the whole ecosystem is six thousand

years old. Five to six thousand years

old. About that. Five or six.

KAUFMAN

Okay.

MIKE OWEN

Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all

the cyrpess strands, probably in the

world. I don't know of any cypress

strand bigger. It's about twenty miles

long, or nineteen, nineteen to twenty,

nineteen... and right here it's about

five miles wide, four and a half, five.

So, again, it's twenty miles long, three

to five miles wide. And over here --

MIKE OWEN

The oldest carbon dating they've done on

any of the peat out here is fifty-seven

hundred years. That's with carbon-14.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

53.

MIKE OWEN (cont'd)

That's in the right age where you can

really date things accurately with carbon-

14, because it's half-life is fifty-five

hundred years, so they must have found

have of it gone and figured that...

KAUFMAN

Why isn't it wet? Orlean wrote about

wading through black, corrosive water.

She said it was the scariest experience

of her life. And when I spoke to you on

the phone, you said wear heavy boots,

long pants and...

MIKE OWEN

There's usually water. We've been going

through a bit of a drought. Say, have

you seen that movie, Medicine Man?

That's a good movie about protecting

nature. It shows there could be

something important in a rain forest we

don't even know about, like a cure for

cancer.

KAUFMAN

It's not even hot. I was expecting it to

be awful. Sun beating down, wading

through water, looking out for snakes,

wild hogs. I was thinking it would be

dramatic. Alligators. Something!

MIKE OWEN

The alligators are over by the lakes.

The temperature's a blessing for us.

This time of year can get uncomfortably

hot.

(pointing excitedly)

Green anole. Florida's most common.

MIKE OWEN (cont'd)

I try to keep a log of sightings.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

It had been a hard day and I hadn't seen

what I'd come to see. Maybe the ghost

orchid was a ghost after all.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

54.

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

There are certainly ghosts in the

Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were

murdered years ago by illegal plume

hunters, and of loggers who were cut to

pieces in fights, and for years there has

been an apparition wandering the swamp,

the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven

feet tall and seven hundred pounds and

have the physique of a human, the posture

of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk.

MIKE OWEN

What Laroche did was wrong. Those

flowers belong to all of us, all 250

million of us -- 250? I think it's up to

270 now -- And belonging to all of us

means they belong to none of us. Nobody

has a right to take them. Not me, not

you, not John Laroche, not...

KAUFMAN

Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a

legendary creature called a Swamp Ape.

Have you ever heard stories or --

MIKE OWEN

(pissy)

Tourist garbage! I don't know why people

need to invent silly creatures to make

nature fascinating. Isn't nature amazing

enough?

KAUFMAN

(shamed)

I just asked because she mentioned it.

ORLEAN

That night I called Laroche.

ORLEAN

(into phone)

I didn't see anything but bare roots.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

55.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

And I had this thought. Maybe the ghost

orchid only blooms in the minds of people

who've walked too long in the swamp.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

What I didn't say to him is that life

seemed to be filled with things that were

just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful

to imagine and easy to fall in love with

but a little fantastic and fleeting and

out of reach.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

What I didn't say to him was that life

seemed to be filled with things that were

just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful

to imagine and easy to fall in love with

but a little fantastic and fleeting and

out of reach.

orchids out there! I've stolen them!

VALERIE (O.C.)

Beautifully written. A really unique

piece.

ORLEAN

Thank you.      Thanks very much.

VALERIE

We're big fans.

ORLEAN

Oh, thank you.

VALERIE

And Laroche is such a fun character.

ORLEAN

Yeah, John's a character all right.

VALERIE

It's funny and fresh.     And sad in a way.

ORLEAN

Well, thanks. Thank you.

VALERIE

So we were wondering, what's next?

ORLEAN

Oh, um, Random House wants me to expand

it into a book. So I'll be doing that.

VALERIE

And there'll be more of Laroche?

ORLEAN

Yeah.   More John, more orchids.

(CONTINUED)

57.

VALERIE

Y'know, we'd really like to option it.

ORLEAN

(laughing)

You want to make this into a movie?

VALERIE

Laroche is such a fun character.   So...

LAROCHE

No shit I'm a fun character.

(beat)

Who's gonna play me?

ORLEAN

I've got to write it first. Someone's

gotta write the screenplay. Most things

never get made. It's premature to --

LAROCHE

I think I should play me.

LAROCHE

I've got all the right qualities. While

you write, I'll take an acting class.

LAROCHE

I wear this just to screw with 'em.

LAROCHE

Most of them don't even bother calling me

John anymore. It's "Crazy White Man"

now.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

58.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

"Crazy White Man" is a good title for the

movie. Call the book "Crazy White Man."

Or, I don't know, "Collector of Hearts"

or something.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

You won't hurt anything.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

(Yelling into phone)

Hello? Hello? Hi? This is John Laroche

from the Seminole Nursery. Sem-ih-nole!

(to Orlean)

How do you say Seminole in Spanish?

That's right, yes! Yeah, I want to order

some more of those pink string beans!

Pink string beans!

Pink String Beans! Pink String Beans!

LAROCHE (cont'd)

(into phone)

I'll call back.

(hangs up)

Hey, Buster.

BAXLEY

John.

LAROCHE

I was trying to order some pink string

beans from Argentina.

BAXLEY

No kidding.

LAROCHE

I figure just because Project Ghost

Orchid is dead, we're not closing shop.

BAXLEY

Listen, John --

(CONTINUED)

59.

LAROCHE

We'll get into plant multiplication. Buy

little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell

'em at a profit. Simple plant

multiplication for the masses.

BAXLEY

John, we're thinking maybe now's a good

time for you to take a few weeks.

LAROCHE

I don't need a vacation, Buster.

BAXLEY

It's a good time.   Things are slow.

LAROCHE

Y'know, the guys on my crew here, all

they do is smoke weed all day. I been

meaning to talk to you about that. So if

it's a question of productivity --

LAROCHE

They're gonna fire me. Goddamn politics.

Crazy White Man's bad publicity.

(pounds steering wheel)

I can't believe I'm dealing with this!

(pounds steering wheel)

Like I could give a damn. If they fire

me, I'll sue. I already did some legal

research on this when I was doing the

other shit. They can't fire me. And I

ain't going to quit.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

(groggy)

Yeah?

ORLEAN

John, it's Susan.

So, I was just wondering if you might be

willing to talk some more.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

What about?

ORLEAN

C'mon, John, I'm trying to put together a

book. Don't just abandon me down here.

LAROCHE

I'm no longer interested in orchids. I'm

pursuing other avenues. I apologize for

any inconvenience this might cause you.

LAROCHE

Thank you for your time.

GUY ON BENCH

We could use the rain, huh?

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

So you from around here?

(CONTINUED)

61.

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

So where then?

KAUFMAN

California.

GUY ON BENCH

(excitedly)

Yeah? I'm moving to L.A. I just wrote a

screenplay. I sent it to a lot of

agents. But if they turn me down, I'll

go there and market it myself. I used to

be in marketing in New York, so I know

exactly how to sell this thing.

(beat)

Where's a nice place to live if you don't

have a car?

KAUFMAN

You kind of need a car. I guess West

Hollywood would be okay.

GUY ON BENCH

So you recommend West Hollywood then.

KAUFMAN

I'm not recommending it.

GUY ON BENCH

I moved down here for a change, and I

wrote the screenplay. Just like that.

It's a great idea.

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

It's about a mob guy, but it's not your

regular mob story. There's a twist. A

cop tells this mob guy's wife that the

mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth

is, the cop's lying because he wants her

for himself. See, they used to go

together in high school.

(waits for response, then:)

You know anything about screenplays?

(CONTINUED)

62.

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

Well, the object is to make people think

you're going in one direction, then you

twist it to keep 'em surprised. I came up

with all these amazing twists out of

nowhere. Well, not nowhere.

(beat)

I'm a born again Christian.

(beat)

You have faith?

KAUFMAN

No.     Not really.

GUY ON BENCH

You don't believe in anything?

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

I don't know how you can look out at this

beautiful ocean and not believe there's

an intelligence that created it.

KAUFMAN

I don't know.

GUY ON BENCH

Well, you can't know until you experience

it. That requires accepting Jesus Christ

as your Lord and Savior. Believe me.

Lookit, if I was to show you a bottle of

clear liquid and told you it was vodka,

how would you know if it really was or if

it was water? There's only one way.

KAUFMAN

I'd smell it.

GUY ON BENCH

(annoyed)

No. You can't smell vodka.    You'd have

to taste it, right?

KAUFMAN

It could be poison.    I don't know you.

GUY ON BENCH

(angry)

Look, let's go with the analogy I'm

drawing here. It's not poison. Okay?

(resuming control)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

63.

GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)

So you'd have to taste it to know.

Right? That's my point.

KAUFMAN

Right.

GUY ON BENCH

That's all I'm saying.

(beat)

So West Hollywood, huh? I think I'll

make it out this year. Because how long

can you look at an ocean, y'know?

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I have failed. I have nothing to say.    I

am fat. I am not a writer.

DRIVER

Mr. Kaufman, do you mind if I ask what

type of work you do for Sony?

KAUFMAN

I'm a writer.

DRIVER

(impressed)

A song writer?

KAUFMAN

No, I'm a screenwriter.

DRIVER

Oh, wow! Good for you. You mind if I

ask what your movie's about?

(CONTINUED)

64.

KAUFMAN

It's about flowers.

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

It's about this poacher who steals

orchids out of a swamp.

DRIVER

I heard about that!   Drug flowers, right?

KAUFMAN

Yeah.   That's it.

DRIVER

I heard about that! That's great!

Action-adventure is my favorite genre.

DONALD

How was Florida, man?

KAUFMAN

(climbing the stairs)

Okay.

DONALD

Cool! Hey, my script's going amazing!

Right now I'm working out an Image

System. Bob calls it an invaluable

asset. Because of my multiple

personality theme, I've chosen the motif

of broken mirrors to show my

protagonist's fragmented self. Bob

teaches that an Image System greatly

increases the complexity of an aesthetic

emotion.

KAUFMAN

You sound like you're in a cult.

DONALD

No, it's just good writing technique.

(types, then:)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

65.

DONALD (cont'd)

Oh, I made you a copy of McKee's Ten

Commandments. I've posted one over both

our work areas.

DONALD

You shouldn't have done that.

DONALD (cont'd)

'Cause it's extremely helpful.

(lies down on floor)

Hey, any sign of that Swamp Ape?

KAUFMAN

There is no Swamp Ape. It was invented

for people who can't find the actual

world fascinating. Y'know?

DONALD

Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Sorry.

Hey, I got a song! "Happy Together." I

was worried about putting a song in a

thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the

greatest screenplay ever written, did

exactly that. Mixed genres.

KAUFMAN

I need to go to bed, Donald.    I haven't

slept in a week.

DONALD

Okay.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

... so we open the swamp... okay,

flashback to young Laroche had turtles...

Okay, Susan says What Is Passion? And

okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a

white van comes tearing around...

66.

KAUFMAN

Damn it.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

There are too many ideas and things and

people, too many directions to go. I was

starting to believe the reason it matters

to care passionately about something is

that it whittles the world down to a more

manageable size.

KAUFMAN

Such sweet, sad insights.   So true.

KAUFMAN

And you're... I like looking at you.

ORLEAN PHOTO

I like looking at you, too.   Charlie.

KAUFMAN

I don't know how to do this. I'm afraid

I'll disappoint you. You've written a

beautiful book. I can't sleep. I'm

losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive --

ORLEAN PHOTO

Shhh. You're not. Whittle it down,

focus on one thing in the story, find the

thing you care passionately about and

write about that.

(CONTINUED)

67.

ORLEAN PHOTO (cont'd)

(sweet, flirty smile)

I figured there might be something...

KAUFMAN

We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile,

beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing

at her desk. She looks at the camera and

talks to us: "John Laroche is a tall guy,

skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch-

shouldered..."

DONALD

Morning.

KAUFMAN

Hey, hey.

DONALD

You seem chipper.

KAUFMAN

I'm good.     I have some new ideas.

DONALD

Cool. Me too. I'm putting in a chase

sequence now. The killer flees on

horseback with the girl. The cop is

after them on a motorcycle. It's like a

battle between motors and horses.

KAUFMAN

They're all still one person, right?

DONALD

Yeah, hey, that's the big pay-off.

KAUFMAN

(nice)

Well, it sounds exciting.

DONALD

Thanks, man. Thanks.

68.

ORLEAN

I suppose what I'd been doing in Florida

was trying to understand how people found

order and contentment and a sense of

purpose in the universe by fixing their

sighs on one single desire. Now I was

also trying to understand how someone

could end such intense desire without a

trace.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

(groggy)

Yeah what?

ORLEAN

Hello, John, it's Susan.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Yeah hi.

ORLEAN

So, how's everything going?

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Great! I'm training myself on the

internet. It's fascinating. I'm doing

pornography. It's amazing how much these

suckers will pay for photographs of

chicks. And it doesn't matter if they're

fat or ugly or what.

ORLEAN

That sounds good.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

It's great is what it is.

ORLEAN

So I've been meeting a lot of orchid

people, going to shows, I thought you

might want to hear about it.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Sorry. I am officially no longer

interested in orchids or the losers who

are still interested in them. The end.

(CONTINUED)

69.

ORLEAN

If you really loved something, wouldn't a

little of it always linger?

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Susan Orlean drives. The golden light of

the afternoon sun caresses her sweet

face. She talks to us.

(copying from book)

"Florida is a landscape of transition and

mutation, a hybrid of ..."

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Susan and her husband eat dinner in

silence. A dying relationship. Husband:

You want to do something tonight? Susan:

I should work. Y'know. I got stuff...

KAUFMAN

I'm so thrilled I get to adapt your book,

get to merge my thoughts with yours. I

love that. It's intimate, like a

marriage.

(CONTINUED)

70.

ORLEAN

Not like a marriage.

KAUFMAN

Maybe what marriage could be.

ORLEAN

Isn't it ironic? You adapting my book?

My three years in Florida meditating on

my inability to experience passion

resulted in my finding it with you.

KAUFMAN

... and in the final sequence Susan as a

young girl swings alone in the backyard.

From high in the air she sees her parents

in separate rooms staring blankly in

opposite directions. This symbolizes the

profound scarring their waning passion

has had on the girl's psyche, how she

became afraid to ever really love

something because it would go away.

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

This is good. I'm finding you.

KAUFMAN

Yallo?

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

Hi, Charlie. It's Valerie. Just bugging

you again. How's everything going?

KAUFMAN

Good.     I think really good now.

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

Great.    So I spoke to Susan yesterday.

KAUFMAN

(beat)

Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

(CONTINUED)

71.

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

I told her you were making terrific

progress and she's really excited to read

the script.

KAUFMAN

Oh.   Good.

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

And she said she'd love to meet you.

KAUFMAN

Um, well, y'know, for me it's distracting

to... or confusing to discuss what I'm

exploring in the screenplay at this

point... before I finish... it. So...

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

That's fair. I'll let her know.

KAUFMAN

Tell Susan I'd be very happy to meet her

at a future date. As she sees fit.

VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)

Okay.   Good enough.

KAUFMAN

And tell her how much I love her book.

Say I think she's such a great writer.

VALERIE (cont'd)

Will do.   Just keep us posted, Charlie.

KAUFMAN

Okay.   Nice talking to you.   Okay then.

(CONTINUED)

72.

KAUFMAN

You can sit here and pretend to be a

writer, mocking the seriousness of what I

do, like some kind of fucking funhouse

mirror version of me! But let me tell

you, you don't know what writing is!

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

She thinks I'm repulsive.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Movie opens.: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old,

bald, paces the room. His voice-over

carpets the scene. "I am old. I am fat.

I am bald. My toenails have turned

strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive?

I don't know for I suffer from a

condition called Body Dysmorphic

Disorder."

JERRY

... we need to talk about the orchid

script. Valerie called yesterday.

They're getting antsy.

KAUFMAN

I think I've got it on track now.

JERRY

Good.   She said you sounded weird.

KAUFMAN

No Hollywood bullshit. Just raw truth.

Sometimes that takes a while to find.

(CONTINUED)

73.

JERRY

Okay.    What's the time frame here?

KAUFMAN

It's goddamned honest, Jerry.   It's true.

JERRY

Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked-

up internet thing. It's a girl taking a

shit, but a trout comes out. You got e-

mail yet? I'll send it to you.

KAUFMAN

This is more honest than anything

anyone's ever done before in a movie,

I'll tell you that. The only truth we

can offer is the truth that's our own

experience of the world. "The great

poet, in writing himself, writes his

time." T.S. Eliot.

JERRY

It sounds good, buddy. But we do need to

give Valerie a ballpark --

KAUFMAN

I'm sick of their constant harassment!

ORLEAN (V.O.)

On December 21, 1993 John Laroche and

three Seminoles illegally removed one

hundred and thirty rare plants from the

Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.

MOTES

You've been checking out the displays?

ORLEAN

Yeah.

(CONTINUED)

74.

MOTES

It's the Miami centennial, we're supposed

to illustrate something about Florida

history.

ORLEAN

Right. Now Laroche is part of Florida

history. As a mannequin.

MOTES

It's a world of words to the end of

it./In which nothing solid is its solid

self. You'll have to forgive me, I'm a

reformed poetry professor.

ORLEAN

Who is that?

MOTES

Wallace Stevens.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

The greatest poverty is not to live/In a

physical world, to feel that one's

desire/is too difficult to tell from

despair.

KAUFMAN'S VOICE (ON RECORDER)

Kaufman sits across from Valerie, a

pretty film executive. He eyes her as

she picks at her salad. She looks up and

he looks down. He sweats. She

compliments him on his work. She rubs

her nose. He pulls at his nostrils. He

tries to sound like he knows what he's

talking about. He's full of shit.

(CONTINUED)

75.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Yeah.

ORLEAN

John, it's Susan.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

I know.

ORLEAN

I went to the Orchid Society Show a

couple of days ago.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

I'm not interested.

ORLEAN

There was a display of you stealing the

ghost orchids. You're famous.

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

I'm not involved in that world now.

ORLEAN

So, look, John, I still haven't seen a

ghost. And I was wondering --

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Yeah, yeah. I'll take you in.

ORLEAN

Really?   Thank you so much!   I just...

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Tomorrow. Pick me up at 5:30 am or it'll

get too hot. I'll buy all the supplies

we'll need.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Kaufman jerks off to the book jacket

photo of Susan Orlean.

KAUFMAN

What?!    What do you want?

DONALD

I finished. My script.    I'm done.

(CONTINUED)

76.

DONALD (cont'd)

So would you show it to your agent?

DONALD (cont'd)

Thanks. Also, I wanted to thank you for

your idea. It was very helpful. I

changed it a little. Now the killer cuts

off body pieces and makes the victims eat

them.   It's, like, I once saw this

picture of a snake swallowing it's tail --

KAUFMAN

Ourobouros.

DONALD

I don't know what that means.

KAUFMAN

The snake is called Ourobouros.

DONALD

I don't think so. But it's cool for my

killer to have this modus operandi.

Because at the end when he forces the

woman, who's really just him, to eat

herself, he's also eating himself to

death.

KAUFMAN

I'm insane. I'm Ourobouros.

DONALD

I don't know what that is.

KAUFMAN

I've written myself into my screenplay.

It's eating itself. I'm eating myself.

DONALD

Oh.   That's kinda weird.

KAUFMAN

It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

It's solipsistic. It's pathetic. I'm

pathetic. I'm fat and pathetic.

(CONTINUED)

77.

DONALD

I'm sure you had a good reason, Charles.

You're an artist.

KAUFMAN

The reason is I'm too timid to speak to

the woman who wrote the book. Because

I'm pathetic. Because I have no idea how

to write. Because I can't make flowers

fascinating. Because I suck.

DONALD

Hey, am I in the script, too?

KAUFMAN

I'm going to New York. I'll meet her.

That's it. That's what I have to do.

DONALD

Don't get mad at me for saying this,

Charles, but Bob's got a seminar in New

York this weekend. So if you're stuck --

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Give yourself a reality check. Phoniness

is transparent, and it is tiresome. Take

pleasure in the beauty and wonders of

nature. A flower is God's miracle.

(CONTINUED)

78.

ORLEAN

Where are our supplies?

LAROCHE

Got everything I need right here.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Look, don't worry about it. We'll get

crap at the Indian trading post on

Alligator Alley. Hey, want me to drive?

LAROCHE

I remember one time when I was a kid,

fifteen or so, my mother and I came to

the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to

photograph. We walked for hours, through

the most intense heat I'd ever felt.   We

couldn't find one. I wanted to turn

back. But my mom said, no.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

79.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

She said, John, if you keep searching for

something past doubt, past hopelessness,

past the absolute certainty that you'll

never find it, if you keep searching past

that, there it'll be. So we walked. I

had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet.

And we found ourselves in this charred

prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know.

And there in the middle of it was this

one gorgeous, snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii.

ORLEAN

He made it sound like a Bible story, the

hopeful journey through darkness into

light. I never thought many people in

the world were like John, but I was

realizing more and more that Laroche was

an extreme, not an aberration -- most

people in some way or another do strive

for something exceptional, something to

pursue, even at their peril, rather than

abide an ordinary life.

LAROCHE

Here we go. Encyclia tempensis.

(CONTINUED)

80.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Nice little sucker, isn't it?

ORLEAN

Cute.

LAROCHE

Clamshell orchid. You know that.

ORLEAN

Uh-huh.

LAROCHE

See, I found you two already. I'll show

you every orchid you want today. I'll

find you a fucking ghost if it kills me.

(pointing to another orchid)

Rigid Epidendrum. That's an ugly-ass

orchid. But I'm no snob. I'm interested

in all orchids. Not just pretty ones.

81.

LAROCHE

(peppy)

They're right nearby.    Just follow me.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Reads Vanity Fair. Funny detail: New

Yorker writer reads Vanity Fair. Use!

KAUFMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

Likes tuna, drinks ice tea. Good

character details. Good stuff!

ORLEAN

Thanks.   Could I get some lemon please?

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not

at all what I imagined. Interesting!

ORLEAN

Laroche, can I ask you a personal

question?

LAROCHE

We're not lost.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps.    Okay.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I have nothing. I am nothing.     I am fat.

I am over. I am lost.

LAROCHE

We're not lost.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

I'm just turned around a little.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a

few minutes, and we'll be able to tell

which way the sun is moving. We want to

be heading southeast.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

This is no big deal. You should eat

something.

(CONTINUED)

83.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

So do you collect anything?

ORLEAN

(non-responsive)

Not really.

LAROCHE

Well, y'know it's not really about

collecting the thing, it's about --

ORLEAN

The sundial isn't working.

LAROCHE

It is so working.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

The thing about computers. The thing I

like is that I'm immersed in it but it's

not a living thing that's going to leave

or die or something. I prefer having the

minimum number of living things to worry

about in my life.

ORLEAN

So, John...

LAROCHE

Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go

straight and eventually we'll get there.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out

of here. I mean, logically, we have to

get out as long as we walk straight.

84.

KAUFMAN

Hello?

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Hey, it's Jerry. I woke you?

KAUFMAN

No, it's okay.

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

How's it going? Has it been helpful to

talk to the writer? What's her name?

KAUFMAN

Yeah.    Susan Orlean.

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Well, I mean, are you making headway?

Valerie's breathing down my neck.

KAUFMAN

You can't rush inspiration.   Y'know?

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Okay, fine. Um, the other reason I'm

calling is to tell you Me, Myself, and I

is just amazing.

KAUFMAN

What the hell is Me, Myself, and I?

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Your brother's script. It's tight,

inventive. A smart, edgy thriller. The

best spec script I've read this year.

KAUFMAN

Oh.   Good.

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

I'm gonna sell it for a shitload. Two

fucking talented guys in one family.

Y'know, maybe you could bring Donald on

to help you finish the orchid thing.

KAUFMAN

Jerry, don't say that.   I mean --

(CONTINUED)

85.

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Just a thought, buddy. He's really

goddamn amazing at structure.

KAUFMAN

Jerry, I gotta go. I have an

appointment. I gotta go.

JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

Adios, buddy. Finish! Finish!

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am fat. I can't write. I am

repulsive. I am old. I have

accomplished nothing. I am just one more

old, fat, bald man on the street.

LAROCHE

I've done this a million times. Whenever

everything's killing me, I just say to

myself, screw it, and go straight ahead.

REGISTRAR

May I help you?

86.

MCKEE

Years from now you'll be standing around

a posh cocktail party congratulating

yourself on how you spent an entire

weekend locked in a room with an asshole,

an opinionated arrogant asshole, for your

art.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I am pathetic. I am a loser.    I am fat.

MCKEE

So... what is the substance of writing?

Nothing as trivial as words is at the

heart of this great art, my friends.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

I have failed. I am panicked. I am fat.

I have sold out. I am worthless. I...

MCKEE

Literary talent is not enough. First,

last, and always, the imperative is to

tell a story.

MCKEE

Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle

said, when storytelling goes bad in a

society, the result is decadence.

(deadpan)

Well, just look around you.

MCKEE (cont'd)

Aristotle also said: A story must have a

beginning, a middle, and an end.

87.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of

conviction that brings me here with all

these desperate idiots lapping up

everything this bag of wind spouts. Easy

answers. Rules to short-cut yourself to

success. And here I am, because my jaunt

into the abyss brought me nothing. Well,

isn't that the risk one takes for

attempting something new. I should leave

here right now. I'll start over --

(starts to rise)

I need to face this project head on and --

MCKEE

... and God help you if you use voice-

over in your work, my friends.

MCKEE

God fucking help you! It's flaccid,

sloppy writing. Any idiot can write

voice-over narration to explain the

thoughts of a character. You must

present the internal conflicts of your

character in image, in symbol. Film is a

medium of movement and image.

MCKEE (cont'd)

Okay, one hour for lunch.

88.

MCKEE

You want your writing to be original.

You want to have an original voice like

Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me

tell you something, my friends. The key

to originality is not eccentricity.

DISSOLVE TO:

MCKEE

Long speechs are antithetical to the

nature of cinema. The Greeks called it

stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of

ideas. A long speech in a script, say a

page long, requires that the camera hold

on the actor's face for a minute. Look

at the second hand on your watch as it

makes one complete rotation around the

clock face and you'll get an idea of how

intolerable that would be for an

audience. The ontology of the screen is

that it's always now and it's always

action and it's always vivid. Life is

rarely vivid. And that's an important

point. We are not recreating life on the

screen. Writers are not tape recorders.

Have you ever eavesdropped on people

talking in a coffee shop? Then you know

how dull and tedious real conversation

is. Real people are not interesting.

There's not a person in this world -- and

I include myself in this -- who would be

interesting enough to take as is and put

in a movie as a character.

DISSOLVE TO:

89.

MCKEE

Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you

think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty.

MCKEE (cont'd)

(deadpan)

Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends,

that there's a fucking God.

MCKEE (cont'd)

Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember,

there'll be a Q and A tomorrow morning

before class starts.

DISSOLVE TO:

MCKEE

Anyone else?

MCKEE (cont'd)

Yes?

(CONTINUED)

90.

KAUFMAN

You talked about Crisis as the ultimate

decision a character makes, but what if a

writer is attempting to create a story

where nothing much happens, where people

don't change, they don't have any

epiphanies. They struggle and are

frustrated and nothing is resolved. More

a reflection of the real world --

MCKEE

The real world? The real fucking world?

First of all, if you write a screenplay

without conflict or crisis, you'll bore

your audience to tears. Secondly:

Nothing happens in the real world? Are

you out of your fucking mind? People are

murdered every day! There's genocide and

war and corruption! Every fucking day

somewhere in the world somebody

sacrifices his life to save someone else!

Every fucking day someone somewhere makes

a conscious decision to destroy someone

else! People find love! People lose it,

for Christ's sake! A child watches her

mother beaten to death on the steps of a

church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody

else betrays his best friend for a woman!

If you can't find that stuff in life,

then you, my friend, don't know much

about life! And why the fuck are you

taking up my precious two hours with your

movie? I don't have any use for it! I

don't have any bloody use for it!

KAUFMAN

Okay, thanks.

KAUFMAN

Mr. McKee?

MCKEE

Yes?

KAUFMAN

I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

(CONTINUED)

91.

MCKEE

(trying to recall)

I need more.

KAUFMAN

I was the one who thought things didn't

happen in life.

MCKEE

Oh, right, okay.    Nice to see you.

KAUFMAN

I need to talk.

MCKEE

I make it a rule not to give private

tutorials to my seminar students. It

wouldn't be fair to the others.

KAUFMAN

Mr. McKee, please. My even standing here

is very scary. I don't meet people well.

I'm self-conscious and timid. But what

you said this morning shook me to the

bone. What you said was bigger than my

screenwriting choices. It's about my

choices as a human being. Please.

MCKEE

I could use a drink, my friend.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

We turned to the right and saw only more

cypress and palm and sawgrass

ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)

So we turned to the left, and there, far

down the diagonal of the levee, we could

see the gleam of a fender. We followed

it like a beacon all the way to the road.

92.

KAUFMAN

... We followed it like a beacon all the

way to the road.

MCKEE

Then what happens?

KAUFMAN

That's the book. I wanted to present it

simply, without big character arcs or

sensationalizing the story. I wanted to

show flowers as God's miracles.   I

wanted to show that Orlean never saw the

blooming ghost orchid. It's about

disappointment.

MCKEE

I see. That's not a movie.     You must go

back and put in the drama.

KAUFMAN

(pause)

I've got pages of false starts and wrong

approaches. I'm way past my deadline. I

can't go back.

MCKEE

Ah, the everpresent deadline. Yes, I was

doing a Kojak once and... it was hell.

MCKEE (cont'd)

Tell you a secret. The last act makes

the film. You can have an uninvolving,

tedious movie, but wow them at the end,

and you've got a hit. Find an ending.

Use what you've learned this weekend.

Give them that and you'll be fine.

KAUFMAN

You promise?

(CONTINUED)

93.

MCKEE

You've taken my course before?

KAUFMAN

My brother did. My twin brother Donald.

He's the one who got me to come.

MCKEE

Twin screenwriters. Julius and Philip

Epstein,who wrote Casablanca were twins.

KAUFMAN

You mentioned that in class.

MCKEE

The finest screenplay ever written.

KAUFMAN (V.O.)

Climax. A revolution in values from

positive to negative or negative to

positive with or without irony -- a value

swing at maximum charge that's absolute

and irreversible.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

Great writers residence.

KAUFMAN

Donald.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

Hey, how's the trip? Gettin' it on with

that lady journalist? You dog you!

KAUFMAN

Yeah. Listen, I'm calling to say

congratulations on your script.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

Isn't that cool? Jerry says he can make

me, like, high-sixes against a mill-five.

KAUFMAN

That's great, Donald.

(CONTINUED)

94.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

I want to thank you for all your help.

KAUFMAN

I wasn't any help.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

C'mon, you let me stay in your place and

your integrity inspired me to even try.

KAUFMAN

Well, look, I've been thinking, maybe

you'd be interested in hanging out with

me in New York for a few days.

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)

Oh my God, yes! I'm flattered!

KAUFMAN

So, like, what would you do?

DONALD

Script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

KAUFMAN

Sorry.   I was trying something.   I --

DONALD

Hey, I don't mind.   It's funny.

KAUFMAN

Okay.    So, what would you do?

DONALD

You and me are so different, Charles.

We're different talents.

KAUFMAN

I know. Just for fun. How would the

great Donald end this script?

DONALD

(giggling)

The great Donald.

(serious)

Well, I mean... do you need the whole

court case?

(CONTINUED)

95.

KAUFMAN

Uh, it's what happened to Laroche.   It's

kind of important.

DONALD

It's boring. No offense. A courtroom

scene should be dramatic. Stick the

ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe.

KAUFMAN

Um.   Okay.

DONALD

Too much about orchids. Get rid of it.

Pare that stuff down to a minimum.

Frankly, I'd focus more on the

relationship between the brothers. I

think that's the gold here. No one cares

about orchids.

KAUFMAN

The book's about orchids.

DONALD

That's a problem. But don't let it ruin

the movie. I mean, for example, use the

orchids in a more dramatic way. Have

some kind of bang-up, crazy action

sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp

better. It's a tremendous fictional

world. A setting of great dramatic

possibility.

KAUFMAN

That's true. But --

DONALD

And put some twists in. Reveal some

surprising thing about Laroche. God,

what am I doing giving suggestions to

you? I mean you're like a seasoned

professional. You're an artist.

KAUFMAN

C'mon, you're the "mill-five" kid.

DONALD

(enjoying this)

Shut up!

(thinks)

I love the Laroche porno web-site stuff.

Is that real? Maybe make a bigger deal

of that. I don't know.

(CONTINUED)

96.

KAUFMAN

I think it's real.   I haven't actually

seen the site.

DONALD

It's sex, man! Incorporate it.

DONALD

Oh, hi, I was doing some research.   I

found Laroche's site and... I'm

embarrassed.

KAUFMAN

Jesus, Donald.

DONALD

What? She's kinda cute. You don't like

her? I dunno, I think she's okay. It's

not like I'm marrying her.

DONALD (cont'd)

Oh, wow.   That's kind of a twist, huh?

KAUFMAN

Jesus.   Jesus!

DONALD

I think this is maybe a good thing for

the script. Go ask her about this.

KAUFMAN

I'm not gonna ask her about this.

DONALD

You want me to? I don't mind.

KAUFMAN

No, I don't want you to.

DONALD

I could easily pretend I'm you.

(CONTINUED)

97.

KAUFMAN

No!    No!

ORLEAN

So you'll pick me up?    Yeah, tomorrow.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

Ten-twenty. TWA. Yes, of course I will.

KAUFMAN

What was she wearing?

DONALD

I don't know. Like a dress maybe.

KAUFMAN

Did she look at me?    At you?

DONALD

Finally! Da-da-da-daaaaah! S. Orlean,

TWA flight 651. Arriving Miami 10:20

tomorrow morning.

KAUFMAN

I don't want to do this, Donald.

DONALD

We'll go together.       It'll be good.

(CONTINUED)

98.

KAUFMAN

It's so weird to actually see that van in

real life.

DONALD

So you want to build the symbolic charge

of the story's imagery from the

particular to the universal. Okay?

KAUFMAN

Okay, but when you're creating an image

system, how do you know --

DONALD

I'll get a closer look.   You wait here.

KAUFMAN

(momentously)

No, I want to go. I should go. I mean,

it should be me, right? I mean...

DONALD

Go for it, bro. You the man.

(CONTINUED)

99.

KAUFMAN

Holy...

LAROCHE (O.S.)

Darlin', I dunno what's come over you!

ORLEAN

Don't stop, Johnny.

ORLEAN (CONT'D)

Johnny! Where are you going?

LAROCHE

Who the hell are you?

KAUFMAN

I just... nobody, I just --

LAROCHE

Who the fuck are you?

KAUFMAN

Um. I'm just. I was at the wrong house.

I'm looking for the Johnson family.

LAROCHE

I got your Johnson family right here.

(CONTINUED)

100.

ORLEAN

Honey, come back to bed.

LAROCHE

Who the hell sent you?      Rudy?

KAUFMAN

I'm not --

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

I'm the screenwriter.

LAROCHE

What the fuck does that mean?

KAUFMAN

I'm the guy adapting her book.      Her book

about you.

LAROCHE

Jesus Fucking Christ.

(then, trying to make sense)

Why the fuck were you in my backyard?

KAUFMAN

I was, um, trying... I don't know.

ORLEAN

Who's the bloody fat guy?

LAROCHE

This is the fellow adapting your book for

the movies, darling'.

ORLEAN

(excited)

Really? I wanted to meet --

(realizing)

Oh. What does he know?

KAUFMAN

I don't know anything.   I swear.

(CONTINUED)

101.

LAROCHE

He knows about the greenhouse.

(to Orlean)

We can't have this appear on the silver

screen.

KAUFMAN

It won't.    I don't even under --

ORLEAN

Johnny, I'm so tired now.

LAROCHE

He needs to be gotten rid of.

KAUFMAN

What?!

LAROCHE

Small article in newspaper.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Screenwriter doing research for movie

about notorious orchid poacher was found

drowned in the Fakahatchee after

accidentally slipping and hitting his

head on a rock. End of story. Is that

credible from a journalistic standpoint?

ORLEAN

Johnny, come lie on top of me.

LAROCHE

Focus, darling'. Is this credible?

ORLEAN

(concentrates)

Um, oh... this screenwriter was killed

doing research in Jamaica a few years

ago.

(to Kaufman)

Screenwriter, you have a car?

(CONTINUED)

102.

KAUFMAN

I, um, no, I --

KAUFMAN (cont'd)

A rental, a rental.

ORLEAN

We drive his car there, leave it on the

side of the swamp. That works.

LAROCHE

Good.   I like that.

ORLEAN

(to Kaufman)

Sorry.

KAUFMAN

Please.

KAUFMAN

I thought I had a sense of you from your

book.

(beat)

I had a little crush on you, to tell the

truth. You're different than I thought.

ORLEAN

Huh.

KAUFMAN

Look, I don't care what you two are you

doing.   Please don't kill me.

ORLEAN

Hey, here's one of my lines.

(mockingly reading from screen)

"Isn't it ironic? You adapting my book?

My three years in Florida meditating on

my inability to experience passion

resulted in my finding it with you."

(CONTINUED)

103.

KAUFMAN

I was trying to do something.

ORLEAN

Well, it's kind of pathetic, dontcha

think?

ORLEAN

Here's me! Here's me again!

(mocking)

"I wanted to know what it's like to care

about something passionately."

KAUFMAN

You can laugh, but I didn't make that

line up. That's a quote from your book.

ORLEAN

Yeah, I know, Charlie-boy. Chill. I'm

laughing at who I used to be. It's sad.

KAUFMAN

So now you learned about passion.

(jealous)

From Weirdo Laroche. Bully for you.

ORLEAN

You can't learn about passion. You can

be passion. And it wasn't John who made

me passion. It was orchids.

KAUFMAN

I thought you didn't even like orchids.

ORLEAN

I lied about what happened at the end of

the book. On the way out of the swamp...

LAROCHE

The jewel of the Fakahatchee.

(CONTINUED)

104.

ORLEAN

I still don't get it. I mean, there it

is. I can see it's pretty, but --

LAROCHE

You'll get it.

ORLEAN (V.O.)

Back in John's basement he explained his

real plans for the ghost. He'd

discovered a chemical inside with

psychoactive properties. His plan had

always been to clone the flower and make

a fortune marketing this drug. It was

Laroche's kind of plan, it wasn't a

controlled substance because the

government didn't know it existed.

ORLEAN

The first time I tried it, the split

second it took effect, I understood

orchids. I loved them with a passion I'd

never felt for anything. For anyone.

ORLEAN

Isn't it curious? An orchid made me

passionate about orchids.

KAUFMAN

You're throwing the truth away for a

chemical confusion of your synapses --

ORLEAN

With this powder I am passionate about

everything.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

105.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

I'm alive in a profound world now. It

sizzles with beauty and horror and sex.

Now writing is -- words are -- a way to

remove yourself from passion. So I'm

done with writing. John and I are making

a fortune with this extract. It's big in

the Miami club scene. We call it

"Passion."

(giggles)

Isn't that cute?

ORLEAN (cont'd)

Follow him, please.

LAROCHE

This spot looks good.

(thinking aloud)

Now how do we do this? Hit him in the

head with a rock first? Keeping in mind

we can only hit him once and only with as

much force as would be created by him

slipping and falling onto the rock.

ORLEAN

Holy Jesus. Holy...   Hey, baby, hey...

LAROCHE

Should we drown him, then hit him on the

head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if

the heart's stopped. These new forensic

guys are very smart. We really have to

know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor

mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular

changes.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

106.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Maybe you think we hit him on the head

and force water into his lungs after he's

dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he

didn't drown. See, contrary to popular

belief, the lungs do not -- do not --

fill with water in a drowning. What

happens is, choking causes an irritation

of the mucous membranes. This creates a

shitload of mucus in the windpipe.

Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a

sticky foam which may or may not mix with

vomit. It's the presence of this white

foam that indicates drowning. There's a

lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints,

hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks.

They all tell a tale to today's forensic

scientists.

(to Kaufman)

What do you think? You're a writer. How

would you do it? What's a good way to

kill somebody?

KAUFMAN

I don't write this kind of bullshit.

LAROCHE

Don't get all huffy, I was simply --

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Fuck!

ORLEAN

(receptively)

Yeah, let's, baby.

LAROCHE

Not now. We got to kill that guy. And

now I guess that other guy as well.

ORLEAN

(disappointed)

Ohhh.

107.

KAUFMAN

For Christ's sake, why didn't you do

something while we were in the car?

DONALD

My back had seized.     I couldn't move.

KAUFMAN

Shit!

DONALD

We've gotta ditch this thing.

KAUFMAN

(hysterical)

It's a rental! It's a rental!

DONALD

Now!

ORLEAN

That's beautiful! What's that, Johnny?

What's that one called? I just so want

to fuck that flower, don't you?

LAROCHE

Asclepias lanceolata. Red milkweed.

Extremely fuckable. But we don't have

time.

LAROCHE

(to Orlean)

What's his name?

ORLEAN

Um, y'know... Charlie or something.

(CONTINUED)

108.

LAROCHE

Charlie! Listen, let's talk! This pie

is big enough for four people!

(to Orlean)

Why are there two of him?

ORLEAN

Identical twigs?

(laughs crazily)

Did I say twigs? I meant twins.

LAROCHE

Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You

want to watch out for that. That's some

evil shit. Cut you up.

KAUFMAN

Fuck you, Laroche!

LAROCHE

Just tryin' to be helpful. Walk with us

and I'll be sure you avoid all the

pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards

and backwards. There's alligators and

poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs.

DONALD

Wait.   Do you hear something?

KAUFMAN

Donald, that sounds bad.

(CONTINUED)

109.

KAUFMAN

Watch out, watch out, watch out!

DONALD

I think we're okay.

DONALD (cont'd)

Hold on!

DONALD (cont'd)

Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you?

KAUFMAN

Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead.

DONALD

We're okay. How's your leg?

KAUFMAN

I don't know. How's your back.

(CONTINUED)

110.

DONALD

It's fine.     My back is fine.

KAUFMAN

Donald!

KAUFMAN

You're gonna be okay.

DONALD

No.  But don't let them get you, too.

(weak smile)

You got a fucking awesome third act.

KAUFMAN

(crying)

Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing

to say and an awful time to say it, but

I'm sorry I didn't get to know you

better. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

DONALD

It's really... You've been really nice.

KAUFMAN

See, it's just I thought I knew you

already. I thought you were me. And I

hated me.

DONALD

Well, don't do that anymore.      Okay?

KAUFMAN

Okay.

(CONTINUED)

111.

MIKE OWEN

Jesus, that writer guy.

ORLEAN

Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon

plastic jewels plopping onto a silver

trampoline! Dontcha think?

LAROCHE

Darlin', please.

ORLEAN

Can we fuck now, baby?    Fuck like lemons?

KAUFMAN

You gotta help me.    You gotta help me.

MIKE OWEN

What the hell is going on here?

KAUFMAN

They're after me. They've got guns.

They killed my brother.

MIKE OWEN

Who's got guns? What are you --

MIKE OWEN (cont'd)

Holy shit.

(CONTINUED)

112.

MIKE OWEN (cont'd)

It's real!     I can't believe it, I never --

ORLEAN

Hey, it's the screenwriter!

KAUFMAN

There's a thing back there!    You don't

want to be here.

LAROCHE

You're right, I don't want to be here.

I'm tired, let's get this over with.

ORLEAN

I love your gun, baby.    Can we trade?

LAROCHE

Stand back, sweetness.

LAROCHE (cont'd)

Susie!   Susie!

ORLEAN

Where'd Johnny go?

LAROCHE (O.S.)

Susie!

(CONTINUED)

113.

ORLEAN

(crying softly)

Oh, Johnny.

KAUFMAN

I'd just stare at your picture, and you

looked so sweet. I read your words and I

thought you were smart and maybe lost and

lonely like me. And the way you wrote

about Laroche. You said he was handsome

even though he had no front teeth --

ORLEAN

Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth.     Oh...

KAUFMAN

I figured you could look at me and see

something, even with all my flaws you

could look at me and find something, you

could maybe someday write a description

of me that would be nicer than the one I

write day in and day out in my head.

(hopefully)

Would it be?

ORLEAN

You're really so wonderful.

KAUFMAN

Really?

ORLEAN

So wonderful. I can see inside your

soul. It glows with orange sadness.

It's raining inside you. I want to run

through your dripply dripples. It's so

beautiful. I love you. I do.

KAUFMAN

It's the drugs.

(CONTINUED)

114.

ORLEAN

No, it's me. It's the real me. Look at

you. I just want to hold you and -- Oh,

crap, it's wearing off. Crap!

ORLEAN (cont'd)

I'm out.     I'm fucking cleaned out.

KAUFMAN

Okay, bye.

ORLEAN

I can't let you go, fatty.    I can't let

you make this public.

ORLEAN (cont'd)

You hear me? You pathetic, fat, bald...

You don't even know how to write! You're

not even... You're not leaving here!

(screaming, crying)

I need a fix! Everything's so ugly!

KAUFMAN

Donald!

DONALD

My brother is not fat. He's not bald.

My brother is a great writer! He was

trying to do something important!

(CONTINUED)

115.

KAUFMAN

That's Mike Owen. John Laroche. Susan

Orlean. I don't know what that is. I

think it might be a Swamp Ape. And

that's Donald, my twin brother. He saved

my life.

POLICE OFFICER

You two really look alike.

KAUFMAN

(proudly)

Yeah. Yes, we do.

ALICE

Oh, I love McKee!

(recognizes Kaufman, gets

reserved)

Oh, hi. Haven't seen you in a while.

KAUFMAN

Hi.    Yeah, I've been away.

ALICE

So you studying screenwriting?

KAUFMAN

I'm actually finishing one up.

ALICE

Good for you! Me too. God, it's so hard

to get in, huh? Everyone and their

brother is writing a screenplay.

KAUFMAN

Yeah. Actually I'm writing this one for

Sony Pictures.

ALICE

Really? Wow. Really?   That's so cool.

(beat)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

116.

ALICE (cont'd)

Wow! So what's it about, if you don't

mind my asking?

KAUFMAN

That's tough. Let's see... about being

yourself, maybe. It's about learning

that if you can't love yourself, you

can't really love anyone.

ALICE

That's true. God, that's so true.     It's

such an important message, y'know?

KAUFMAN

See, my twin brother was murdered

recently --

ALICE

Oh God!    I'm sorry.   That's so horrible.

KAUFMAN

Thanks. Like part of me ripped away.

Forever. It was a wake up call.

ALICE

I'm so sorry. You poor man.

KAUFMAN

Anyway, it helped put things in

perspective. Life is a miracle. All

life, from the flower to the human being.

You. Me. And I want to show people

that. For my brother. For everyone.

ALICE

Listen, do you mind if I sit for a sec?

KAUFMAN

But you're working.

ALICE

(shrugs)

It's a stupid job, y'know.    I'm Alice.

KAUFMAN

Charlie.

ALICE

I like that name. Charlie. I've always

really liked that name. Charlie.
