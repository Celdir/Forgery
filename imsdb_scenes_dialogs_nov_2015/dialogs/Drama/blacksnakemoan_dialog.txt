RONNIE

his hands)

Rae don't do this now...

RAE

It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!

RONNIE

Rae!

RONNIE

(reaches in his pocket)

Look it. I got somethin' for us.

This is gonna help, okay.

GILL

You gonna miss your bus.

RONNIE

This watch here is gonna beep at

midnight. Every night. That's when

it comes up on you the hardest, right?

RONNIE

And wherever I'm at, my watch'll

beep, too. We'll be thinkin' bout

each other at the same time. Wherever

we are.

RONNIE

I gotta believe we can do this or I

ain't gonna make it, Rae.

RAE

Okay... Okay.

RONNIE

I love you.

RAE

Shit.

RAE

Goddammit, Ronnie...

(shouting in

frustration)

GODDAMMIT!

RAE

Mm-mm

Mm-mm... Mm-mm...

RAE

MM-MM! MM-MM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

CUT TO:

RAE

We're done, right?

CUT TO:

R.L.

You ain't gonna make a fuss, are

you?

(no answer)

Nothing a man can do when a woman

make up her mind.

LAZARUS

I never laid a hand on her in anger.

Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'.

But this business got me wonderin'

what a good shake and slap would do

for her.

R.L.

That kind of talk is between us.

Don't you go in there with that shit

on your tongue.

LAZARUS

I didn't start this, R.L.

R.L.

You wanna pray with me 'fore you go

in? Laz?

(R.L. touches Laz's

arm and bows his

head)

Heavenly Father...

CUT TO:

R.L. (V.O.)

We do not question your divine plan

for us, Oh God. But in these times,

when our spirit lies in shadow. When

we are lost.

R.L. (V.O.)

We ask that you give us strength.

Give us strength that surpasses all

understanding. In your name we pray.

Amen.

ROSE

Can't remember the last time I saw

you in that suit.

LAZARUS

Your mother's funeral. I's a

pallbearer, remember?

WAITRESS

Can I start you both off with some

coffee 'fore I take your order?

ROSE

We won't be stayin' long. Coffee'll

be fine.

ROSE

We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a

friend in Mobile gonna get him a job

at the water company...

LAZARUS

(interrupting)

If you come to talk about that

muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and

leave you sittin' pretty in that new

suit he bought'cha.

ROSE

Think this about money still, ya old

fool?

LAZARUS

Say what you gotta say, but I ain't

gonna hear you speak his name to me.

Not never. You hear?

ROSE

How many times we been over this,

Laz? How many times?

ROSE

Thought we was gonna be friendly

about this.

LAZARUS

Carryin' on behind my back. Make me

out to look like a fool to all our

people. Tell me, what's friendly

about that?

ROSE

I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin'

with you. I feel it. Like I'm one

foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to

my momma. And that's not gonna happen

to me. I got living to do.

LAZARUS

And you gonna live it with him?

LAZARUS

Rose. Folks get sick. But you do

what you can to get on the mend. Our

marriage... it just got sick. That's

all.

ROSE

Talk to me about sick. Ain't been

right since I moved into that drafty

house.

LAZARUS

I keep the heat on.

ROSE

That damned, rusty, radiator, bout

burned the skin off my legs each

time I passed.

LAZARUS

Kept us warm for twelve years.

ROSE

I deserve better than this.

LAZARUS

Better'n me?

ROSE

Better than what you give.

LAZARUS

Rose... please...

ROSE

Laz... You can't say nothin'...

LAZARUS

If we get with a counselor. At the

church, maybe they's...

ROSE

(the final interruption)

I don't love ya no more.

ROSE

I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I

say, this the only life I got.

(waits for him to

respond)

I said my piece.

LAZARUS

God forgive you, for how you done

me...

ROSE

Let go...

LAZARUS

My Daddy told me that a younger woman

would bleed me dry. And that's what

you did. Ya bled me.

ROSE

Let go of my arm...

LAZARUS

Would'a chopped my arm off if you

asked. And this how you do me!

ROSE

LAZ, I said let...!

LAZARUS

You better pray, gal. You better

pray...

ROSE

(yanks free)

Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!

ROSE

cough pills like they's Skittles.

Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get

TEHRONNE

LAZARUS

Mayella. It ain't happened yet. Ain't

MAYELLA

(retreating with a

glare)

I know you hurtin', Laz. I got ears,

blues than some good pussy.

BOJO

Whole lotta woman, right there.

LAZARUS

She can still spread it around.

BOJO

LAZARUS

I'm gonna finish my beer.

DEKE

Mind if I sit?

(no answer)

Rose said... it didn't go too well

this afternoon. See, that's not how

we wanted this to go down. I told

her, I said, Rose, we ain't leavin'

till we make peace with Laz. And

that's God's truth. I laid it down.

LAZARUS

You laid it down.

DEKE

I did.

LAZARUS

Funny. Layin' it down... for my wife.

DEKE

We're not gonna get through this

clean. But it don't need to get dirty.

All this... it just come together

unexpected. You think I want to hurt

you? I... I'd take a bullet for you,

Laz.

LAZARUS

You wanna give that a try?

(to Bojo)

Bo. You still got that .22 behind

the tap? My little brother say he'd

take a bullet for me.

(into Deke's eyes)

You come here to ease your heart.

Well, I ain't gonna give it to you.

You took her into your bed, now you

gotta lie in it.

DEKE

I'll always love you, Laz. Till the

end of my...

BOJO

LAZ!

LAZARUS

Cain slew Able. Slew him out of envy.

And God put his mark on Cain for his

sin. You want that mark, Deke? Give

you that peace you come here for?

I'll give it to you, just say that

shit again. Say you love me. Go'on!

Say YOU LOVE ME, NIGGA!

LAZARUS

I'm through wit'cha both.

DEKE

What'chu gonna do? Nothin'. YOU AIN'T

GONNA DO NOTHIN'!

Dale. He say it purrs like a kitten

themselves up.

RAE

Can't be thinkin' bout him every

second of my day. I'll go outta my

gourd.

JESSE

Why should you waste your life waitin'

closed)

I'm lost without your love.

Just like a bird without a feather,

I'm lost without your love.

You know I need your love just like

the angels need heaven above.

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

(singing)

Well I sure did shot my baby, but I

did it because she did me wrong.

Well I sure did shot my baby, but I

did it because she did me wrong.

You know the judge called it murder

LAZARUS

(singing)

I loved that woman, she said she

didn't love no one but me.

I loved that woman, she said she

didn't love no one but me.

I AIN'T LETTIN' YOU DIE!

LAZARUS

Put fear of the Devil in me, gal.

Got me spooked like I's a kid, I

(flips through the

pages)

But the good Lord, He showed me what

R.L. say... listen here...

(Rae sobs like a child)

This here Matthew. He talkin' on how

Jesus was healin' the sick. And a

man come up to the disciples and he

say...

(reads deliberately)

Have mercy on my son, for he is a

lunatic, and sore vexed...

(to Rae)

He got the devil in his mind and

sores on his skin.

(reads)

And he brought the boy to the

disciples, but they could NOT cure

him.

LAZARUS

(reading)

Then Jesus answered and said, O

faithless and perverse generation...

how long shall I suffer you? Bring

the boy hither to me. And Jesus

rebuked the devil.

(to Rae)

You hear that?

(reads)

Then the disciples say... Why could

not we cast the devil out? And Jesus

said unto them...

LAZARUS

Listen now... This what he sayin' to

us. He say...

(reads)

If ye have faith... if ye have faith

as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall

say unto a mountain, remove hence...

and it... shall... move. And

nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible

to you.

(to Rae)

You hear that? You just need a bit

of faith. You just gotta believe you

TEHRONNE (V.O.)

She been bumpin' around all her life,

hookin' up with whoever keep her fed

and fucked.

TEHRONNE (V.O.)

I seen her give it up on park benches,

back of trucks, hoopty hoods, you

name it.

FLASH TO:

TEHRONNE

You ever seen a train run on a woman?

LAZARUS

Nuh-uh.

TEHRONNE

Meanin' like a team of fellas go to

work on her and she don't even break

a sweat.

(puts his pager away)

She into football, you know. You got

a letter on your jacket you get that

pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.

LAZARUS

How a girl get like that?

TEHRONNE

Like I told you.

FLASH BACK TO:

TEHRONNE (V.O.)

Girl got a sickness.

DEKE (V.O.)

What'chu gonna do? Huh? Nothin'. YOU

AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHIN'! NOTHIN'!

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

(singing to himself)

Tell me who's that writin'? John the

Revelator. Wrote the book of the

seven seals.

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

Hey.

LAZARUS

Take it easy now. Don't rush it.

RAE

(a scratchy whisper)

How long... how long I been out?

LAZARUS

You been in and out goin' on two...

maybe two days.

RAE

(can't believe it)

Two days?

LAZARUS

After your fever broke, you'd wake

up in spells... long enough to get

that medicine in ya.

LAZARUS

Found you on the side of the road.

Someone took to beatin' on you pretty

bad. You know who done that to you?

RAE

Where's Ronnie?

LAZARUS

Well I don't...

RAE

(remembering)

Wait. He left.

RAE

I don't got any money... for fixin'

me up and all.

LAZARUS

Don't need none.

RAE

Then I better be on my way. Don't

wanna put you out no more.

LAZARUS

Think it'd be best if you stayed put

while we talk.

RAE

Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.

LAZARUS

Best try gettin' ya wits about you

'fore you try to...

LAZARUS

Let me say somethin' first...

RAE

Why you got me chained?

LAZARUS

Way I see it, it's gonna take a while

for you to get right.

RAE

The fuck you been doin' to me?

LAZARUS

I ain't laid a hand on ya but to

ease yo fever... Remember like I

say, I found you in the road...

RAE

(yanks at the chain

around her waist)

Get this Goddamn thing off me!

LAZARUS

Now, no harm's come to you... and I

aim to keep it that way. Ain't

gonna... gonna run a train over ya...

or however you call it... see... you

was runnin' wild on me... these fever

dreams you was havin'... these fits.

I'd be chasin' you all night.

RAE

Well I'm woke now... you can take

this off.

LAZARUS

Gal, you ain't right yet.

RAE

I'm right enough to stand on my own

two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain

off...

LAZARUS

How you let men treat ya like they

do?

RAE

What?

LAZARUS

These men you up under. How you let

them do ya like that?

RAE

(grips the chain)

Do me? Do me like this, you mean?

Like chainin' me up?

LAZARUS

You know what I'm talkin' about.

(beat)

All that mess with ya teachers and...

boys in the backs of trucks.

RAE

(shocked)

The hell you know about me?! You got

no right to talk to me about that

shit! The hell you think you are?

LAZARUS

(interrupting)

I've saved ya life, gal. I can do

and say whatever the fuck I want.

LAZARUS

I give ya enough chain so's you can

get about the house. Get you to the

kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll

reach.

RAE

What do you want?

LAZARUS

We got everything we need. Plenty of

food. Ya medicine still got a few

good swallows in it...

RAE

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!

(Laz can't answer)

WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO

IT! AND LET ME GO!

LAZARUS

God saw to it to put you in my path.

And I aim to cure ya of your

wickedness.

RAE

You some kind'a pervert?

LAZARUS

No ma'am.

RAE

Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck

the spirit into me...

LAZARUS

In my house, you watch that lip...

RAE

(furious, near tears)

Look it, mister... you wanna have

your way, you take it. I'll do

whatever you want. But you gotta let

me go. You can't do this! You can't

KEEP ME HERE!

LAZARUS

You sick. You got a sickness... we

broke that fever... we gonna break

that hold the devil got on ya.

RAE

(screaming)

HELP!

RAE

SOMEBODY!

RAE

SOMEBODY HELP ME!

LAZARUS

(to the radiator)

Ain't gonna be moved.

LAZARUS

GAL! I ain't gonna be moved on this!

RAE

LET ME GO!

LAZARUS

You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't

gonna bend my will.

(pulls her closer)

Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.

(Pulls her again)

Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to

the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE

GENERATION.

LAZARUS

Now you get up! And you get in my

house!

RAE

Or what?

CUT TO:

RAE

Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!

LAZARUS

Whose doin' is that?

RAE

Okay... OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW

QUIT IT!

LAZARUS

Say we talk. Just take a seat on the

sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to

drink.

LAZARUS

You may not remember. But you spent

a whole half day in my tub, tryin'

to cool down. Melted four ice trays.

LAZARUS

Wicked little bitch... gonna cut

me...

RAE

You gonna get a lot more a'that, you

keep me locked up like this!

LAZARUS

Think I'm gonna let you do me like

that...

LAZARUS

(regaining his cool)

Okay, now... I ain't gonna hit'cha.

(the burning is

starting)

Just lost my cool there.

(he throws the belt

away)

Now take that look out'cha eye.

LAZARUS

No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.

RAE

(shaking her head)

Hm-mm... Hm-mm...

LAZARUS

I said... STOP!

RAE

(on the verge of crying)

I CAN'T!

RAE

Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT!

LAZARUS

You hungry?

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

I put some back ache into growin'

them greens. You should slow down

and see how they taste.

CUT TO:

RAE

You like this? Walkin' me through

this field like I's your mule?

LAZARUS

Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need

to get your legs strong.

RAE

(sassy)

If I break one you gonna shoot me?

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

My Daddy was one of the first mens

to organize soil conservation in

these parts. That's a group of

farmers, you know, each season they'd

rotate the crop. Know why it's best

to rotate em like that?

RAE

Uh-uh.

LAZARUS

Cuz once in a while soil need a

change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate

in the fertilizer. So next crop what

ya do is plant ya some soy beans.

That give off a lot of nitrate. Change

keeps it all growin' and growin'

strong.

(regarding the eye)

Sting a bit?

RAE

Itches.

LAZARUS

Means ya healin'.

(a nod)

So all this farmin' make me think on

Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of

the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on

the wayside, some fell in thorns...

you know the story?

RAE

Uh-uh.

LAZARUS

The seed that land on good soil is

for them who hear the word of God...

and understand the word of God. Not

enough for you to hear what I'm

sayin', you gotta understand.

RAE

I know. I get it. What's Matthew

doin'?

LAZARUS

Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit...

this just a story...

(quelling his

frustration)

Look it. I've seen it in nature,

I've seen it in men. Ya got to change

up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't

gettin' in.

(Rae remains silent)

Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no

cause to be up under these fools,

ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like

you somebody's dog. No woman... who

joins in union with Almighty God...

or man... in the sanctity of

marriage... should degrade herself...

and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!

LAZARUS

(shouting)

My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE?

I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit.

Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket

jukes all ya life... a nigga learn

how to sin, let me tell you!

(grips her by the

legs)

I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE!

BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT

IS BILE, GAL!

RAE

Let go of me...

LAZARUS

GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP!

BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!

RAE

GET OFF ME!

LAZARUS

(offering her the

glass)

Didn't mean to go off on a tear like

I did. I just got to thinkin' about

things...

RAE

Why is it you old men gotta talk so

much? Like little boys, gotta talk

yourself into fuckin' me.

(his knuckles touch

her skin)

We can take our time. I'm grown. I

get it.

(she leans even closer)

You wanna give me 'nother bath?

RAE

(under her breath)

Goddammit.

FADE TO BLACK.

GENE

There goes our fortune. We been doin'

good for ourselves since you been

away.

LAZARUS

Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up?

ARCHIE

You needin' to buy some pantyhose?

LAZARUS

Just some dresses.

CUT TO:

RAE

Hello? Hey!

RAE

I don't believe this shit.

RAE

Enough to choke a Goddamn horse.

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

I'm needin' some women's clothes. A

few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But

they gotta be nice. They gotta be

proper. Clothes a woman would want,

where she could feel and look like a

woman without... you know, lookin'

like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'.

ELLA MAE

And, sir... do you have a size in

mind for what you're lookin' for?

LAZARUS

(points to Rhonda)

That young lady's size, right'cher.

ELLA MAE

Well, that makes it easier.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLA MAE

Well... I hope these will work for

your niece. She can always come back

in and swap sizes.

LAZARUS

Mind I ask, what's all this business

here?

ELLA MAE

These are whipped body creams. It's

like a lotion.

LAZARUS

For your hands?

ELLA MAE

Some women prefer not to scent their

bodies with perfume. So now they

have scented creams. They help

moisturize a woman's skin.

(unscrewing a jar)

This one's my favorite. It's called

Ginger Souffle. I recommend...

applying the cream while the skin is

still damp. So... perhaps just after

a shower.

LAZARUS

(likes what he smells)

I'll take a jar of that, too.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

Lookin' for Miss Angela.

GIRL

She in the back.

ANGELA

Wait right there.

LAZARUS

I brung you a little basket of

goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes,

some okra, butter beans.

ANGELA

(taking the basket)

You didn't have to do this.

LAZARUS

Just wanted to say how much I

appreciate you helping me the other

day. My niece, she's cured up, and I

got you to thank.

ANGELA

Well that's good. I'm happy to hear

it.

LAZARUS

Look here. I got somethin' special

for you.

LAZARUS

This here is a whipped... body cream.

And it's got a smell to it. Tell me

what you think.

LAZARUS

They call this Ginger Souffle. Best

if it... if it go on your skin just

after you been in a hot tub... or

shower.

ANGELA

This was very sweet of you.

LAZARUS

Well. Hope you enjoy it.

GIRL

Oooooo.

ANGELA

Hush up.

RED

You gonna be on the square later on?

LAZARUS

Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm

headin' home.

RED

Stay cool. It's a hot one.

R.L.

Hey, Red. Was that Laz just left?

RED

Yes'sir, Rev'rend.

CUT TO:

RAE

(trying to sing)

You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.

You make me happy when skies are

gray. You'll never know dear how

much I love you. Please don't take

my sunshine away. A voice from outside

spins her around. The guitar barks

as Rae slams it down on the table.

LINCOLN (O.S.)

Mister Lazarus?

LINCOLN

Mister Laz... I come for the butter

beans.

FLASH TO

FLASH BACK TO:

LINCOLN

Ain't seen you on the square. Mister

Laz, can you hear me?

LINCOLN

(worried now)

Mister Lazarus?

LINCOLN

Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside...

LAZARUS

SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...!

LAZARUS

CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE...

LAZARUS

Lincoln, come on back.

R.L.

Was that Lincoln James I seen run

off?

LAZARUS

He's fine. Just had a bad fall.

R.L.

Why's his britches round his knees?

LAZARUS

R.L., you gonna have to get on. I

can't have nobody round my place.

R.L.

You get a call from Rose?

LAZARUS

This ain't got nothin' to do with

that woman. Just don't want nobody

around me now.

R.L.

Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been

callin' the last few days.

R.L.

Goin' dove huntin'?

LAZARUS

You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin'

this time.

R.L.

You sayin' that gun's for me if I

don't?

(LAZ CAN'T ANSWER)

Spell it out, Laz. Man big enough to

pull a gun best have a tongue in his

mouth if he ain't got a brain in his

head.

LAZARUS

You ain't gonna talk me outta shit

no more. I got my mind made up and I

ain't gonna be moved on this.

R.L.

(amused)

Ain't gonna be moved?

LAZARUS

Got no place for preachin' here. Not

now. So you do as I say...

R.L.

(still stepping closer)

Or what?

LAZARUS

I told you to TURN BACK!

R.L.

YOU GO'ON AND SHOOT ME, KILLA!

R.L.

Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this

at me.

(unloads the rifle)

Always gotta bring up the preachin'.

Like you just a sheep in my flock

and all I'm good for is poundin' on

a pulpit.

(gets in Laz's face)

Dammit, Laz... we may not be blood.

But we sucked off the same old nurse

since the day we was slapped on the

ass. And you gonna point a gun at

me?

R.L.

If you in some trouble, than WE gonna

figure somethin' out. You and me.

(hands him a bandana)

Wipe your face!

R.L.

Now... this got anything to do with

Rose?

(Laz shakes his head)

Then what?

CUT TO:

RAE

(on the verge of tears)

I didn't want to.

R.L.

Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?

LAZARUS

Man like you ought not take the Lord's

name like you just done.

R.L.

A naked woman, chained in ya house?

LAZARUS

I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I

found her beat. Left for dead. So I

brung her home.

R.L.

Laz, I know about that girl.

(beat)

Good number of this town's sinners

got my ear, you know.

(shakes his head)

Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs

and them STD's. What'chu thinking?

LAZARUS

I haven't laid a hand. On my life,

R.L., my wick is dry on this.

R.L.

You say she was beat on. You call

the sheriff on that?

LAZARUS

Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out

here, alone, with a beaten, half

naked, white woman loves to fuck. I

been toe to toe with the law in this

town for no more than being black

and nearby.

R.L.

What's that chain around her for?

LAZARUS

Why don't you go'on and ask her. She

need to talk wit somebody with sense.

Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on

this gal all her days. And this is

how I'm handling it.

R.L.

THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS

HOW YOU HANDLING IT?

LAZARUS

Go in and talk to her. Please.

LAZARUS

Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I

expect you to come.

R.L.

You mean with you and that woman

chained to ya radiator?

LAZARUS

You treat folks special when they

company. It's just supper, R.L.,

shit.

R.L.

One thing at a time, Laz.

LAZARUS

Watch y'self in there. That girl'll

jump on ya junk like a grasshopper.

LAZARUS

Did I hurt'chu?

LAZARUS

What happened in there... that won't

your fault. Ain't a young man alive

could keep they britches on with

that girl being in heat like she is.

LINCOLN

Why she got a chain on her?

LAZARUS

That's between her and me. It's

private. And I don't want you goin'

off and tellin' ya daddy.

LINCOLN

(in a panic)

Please don't tell my daddy.

LAZARUS

My mouth is shut, boy. And that's

how we gonna keep it. Don't go

braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?

LAZARUS

So...

(a bonding smile)

That your first time?

LINCOLN

Yes'sir.

LAZARUS

You struck some gold, didn't ya?

LAZARUS

Shit. My first time was with my second

cousin behind my uncle's barn. She

weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a

done a lot better for myself. You

sho'nuf did.

RAE

Thank you.

R.L.

(sits next to her)

I gotta ask you. Why do you think

Laz is keepin' you chained like this?

RAE

(shrugs at first,

then:)

You know how, like they say, you

save someone's life, you responsible

for them. Guess he just don't think

it's safe for me.

R.L.

So he got it into his head that the

only thing gonna keep you from endin'

up bleedin' on the side of the road

again, without a stitch of clothing

on is...

(R.L. yanks on the

chain)

You think he's crazy for thinkin'

that?

RAE

You a preacher?

R.L.

That's right.

RAE

Can I ask you a question?

(R.L. nods)

People always say, you gotta get

good with Jesus, if you want not to

go to hell. That you say sorry for

all you done and... and Jesus would

let you go on to heaven.

R.L.

You could put it that way.

RAE

But that's so fuckin' stupid.

(she catches herself)

I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.

R.L.

What's on your mind?

RAE

You can't hurt people... and then

just say, I'm sorry, and then

everything just gets washed away.

Why would heaven want people like

that. People who... do what they

want and then... switch.

R.L.

I'm gonna tell you somethin', and

it's just gonna be between you and

me.

(Rae anxiously nods)

I think folks carry on about heaven

too much. Like it's some all-you-can-

eat buffet up in the clouds. And

folks just gonna do as they're told

so they can eat what they want behind

some pearly gates. I can go to

Shoney's for that.

R.L.

There's sin in my heart. There's

evil in this world. But when I got

no one... I talk to God. I ask for

strength. I ask for forgiveness. Not

for peace at the end of my days when

there's no more life to live and no

more good to do, but today. Right

now.

R.L.

What's your heaven? What gives you

peace?

RAE

(struggling to speak)

Ronnie.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

(into the phone)

This is Ronnie again. Don't know if

you been gettin' my messages but...

I'm down at the bus station and...

(struggles)

I just need you come get me. You get

this message, I'm on the interstate

headin' downtown toward the square.

(sadness hits)

Rae. I really need you to... come

find me. Please.

CUT TO:

LINCOLN

We gonna eat with her?

R.L.

That's what I was told.

LINCOLN

She still gonna have that chain on?

R.L.

Well... I'm working on that.

(trying to change the

subject)

So... what's goin' on in your life,

Lincoln?

LINCOLN

I ain't no virgin no more?

LAZARUS

Now that's sharp. That is sharp.

Chain give you any trouble?

RAE

Uh-uh.

LAZARUS

Good. Now I got the steaks on,

potatoes at a boil, and biscuits

ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and

Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the

corn. What do you know how to make?

RAE

I don't fuckin' cook.

LAZARUS

(a look of

disappointment)

Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk

all my life. And let me tell you...

RAE

Look it... I put the Goddamn dress

on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin'

myself with some... fuckin' restraint

here... how you got me locked up

like a dog on a...

LAZARUS

If all you got is filth comin' out'cha

mouth... people just gonna tune ya

out.

(interrupting her)

Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya.

I just know you got more in you than

junk.

(a breath)

Now, you sayin' you don't know how

to cook anything at all?

(Rae shrugs)

You know how to boil water?

RAE

I can handle that.

LAZARUS

(hands Rae a pot)

Well, get to it.

CUT TO:

LAZARUS & LINCOLN

Amen.

R.L.

Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.

LAZARUS

Y'all let me know if these steaks

are too dry.

R.L.

This all looks wonderful.

LINCOLN

I skipped lunch.

LAZARUS

Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to

eat.

R.L.

(to Laz)

Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick

to it. What'chu got in this?

LAZARUS

(motions to Rae)

Ask the chef.

RAE

Cayenne pepper.

CUT TO:

GILL

(surprised)

Holy shit.

RONNIE

(understanding)

Yeah.

GILL

Sit down, man. Need a beer?

RONNIE

Sure.

GILL

(to the bartender)

Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.

RONNIE

Hey, Herman.

HERMAN

They buy you that big chicken dinner?

GILL

What?

HERMAN

They got little names for everything

in the corps when they trying to get

rid of ya. Don't know what it's like

in the guard. There's what you call

a bad conduct discharge, a BCD... we

all called it the big chicken dinner.

It ain't the brig but it'll fuck ya

for life if you wantin' to work for

the government.

RONNIE

That's not what this is about.

HERMAN

They got another little name called

ad-sep. That sound about right?

HERMAN

Ad-sep. Administrative separation.

GILL

(to Ronnie)

How do you get one of those?

HERMAN

Blowin' boys in the head, for one.

HERMAN

Whoa, son! I ain't sayin' shit about

you. I'm just talkin'.

RONNIE

Well, you don't know what you're

talking about so why don't you shut

the fuck up?

GILL

Hey, it's alright, man. It's alright.

(to Herman)

Herman. Come on. He just got back.

HERMAN

To get back ya had to've gone

somewhere.

GILL

What happened?

RONNIE

They been keepin' a folder on me cuz

of my stomach. Like how it was just

before we'd play ball back in school.

Thought it was just some tic I got,

or ulcers like my daddy had.

(takes a drink)

I can't... shoot. Target practice

I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers

each time but...

(feels a stomach cramp)

But when there's really loud noises

around me... somethin' happens. I

get shaky and... I lose my breath.

They called it anxiety. Severe

anxiety. It can be fixed and all...

just not in time for....

(another drink)

It's a long process but... they sent

me home.

GILL

I guess it could be worse. You could

be comin' back in a body bag.

RONNIE

I can't get Rae on the phone. She's

not at home... none of her friends

seen her anywhere.

GILL

She's around. Always is.

RONNIE

I don't know. She's gettin' crazy,

like she gets. Begged me not to go.

Got real down. I just think somethin's

happened. Like she run off with

someone. You'd tell me if you knew

somethin', right?

GILL

You been home yet?

RONNIE

Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate

when I seen your truck outside.

GILL

You need a ride?

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Rae?

RONNIE

This don't feel right. Kitchen looks

just like I left it. I know, cuz I

cleaned it.

GILL

She ever tell you she was thinkin'

of taking off?

RONNIE

I just been so mixed up lately, Gill.

And, you know, with her history, I

can see how she could get scared...

(tears)

...and run.

GILL

Drink. Come on, drink some.

RONNIE

Her momma works down at the grocery,

down on the square. Maybe she seen

her.

GILL

Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too

close to it.

(Ronnie waits)

These nervous spells you get. You

never had that shit back in school...

RONNIE

That's not right, really, cuz I...

GILL

(continuing)

You joined up in that monkey troop

cuz you had a plan for yourself.

Army'd pay for school. You were gonna

get a degree, maybe somethin' in

business or agriculture and you were

gonna make somethin' of yourself.

GILL

And then you had to fall in love

with the school slut.

RONNIE

Now wait...

GILL

(continuing)

With all she was doin'. With all the

shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck

to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't

let go.

RONNIE

I know about how she was like. But

we was different. I's the only person

she talked to about it. How she's

abused. Terrible things, Gill, just

terrible...

GILL

YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN

LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS

OUT OF YOU!

RONNIE

It's not her fault, Gill. She's had

to take care of me all this time,

cuz I'd just start throwin' up...

choking. Just losin' my grip. And

she listened. She listened to me.

(Gill releases Ronnie

and walks away)

And... I got better. I don't get

nervous like I used to. And since we

been together... she been faithful

to me. Put all that junk behind her...

GILL

The only thing that cunt's had behind

her is me and half the town fuckin'

her.

(Ronnie can't believe

it)

Your first night away, I come over

and drop off the spare keys like you

wanted me to. You weren't gone two

hours and she was aching to get me

inside her. Like she was havin' some

kind'a fit.

GILL

(pours a drink)

Don't you think it's funny how I

know where everything in your house

is?

(moves in close)

I don't care if that hurts you or

not. Truth is I don't know who you

are anymore. So fuck it.

GILL

You gonna steal my truck?

RONNIE

Make yourself at home. You done it

already.

CUT TO:

R.L.

Gotta get that chain off her, Laz.

Somethin' like this gets out, you

could land in a heap of trouble.

LAZARUS

I'm dealin' with what God put before

me.

R.L.

You believe He wants this? A woman

chained to ya radiator?

LAZARUS

Not like that.

R.L.

Then what?

LAZARUS

She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to

each other.

R.L.

I can't leave unless I get your word.

R.L.

Laz. I got some news you need to

hear. It's about Rose and your

brother.

(this is not easy for

R.L.)

She's pregnant. She gonna have a

baby.

(silence)

Her sister told my wife. You know

how them sewing circles go. Just a

matter of time till you got word.

Thought that's why you been keepin'

to yourself out here.

(Laz conceals his

pain)

I don't know how much of this is to

make her happy or to hurt you. But

it is what it is.

LAZARUS

I'm through with them both.

CUT TO:

RAE

They sure liked them devilled eggs.

LAZARUS

You drink whiskey?

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

You take it straight?

RAE

Sure.

LAZARUS

(holding up the glass)

To my baby brother. Gonna be a daddy.

RAE

Well, that's good news. So you're

gonna be someone's uncle.

LAZARUS

Want another?

RAE

We drinkin' buddies now?

LAZARUS

(pours two more glass)

To freedom.

RAE

Still makin' jokes?

LAZARUS

(pulls out his keys)

No joke.

LAZARUS

Not my place to change your mind, or

anybody else's. People gonna do how

they please. You only get one life...

should be lived the way you wanna

live it.

LAZARUS

If you want... I can take you back

to town now.

RAE

I ain't in a hurry.

RAE

Could you do somethin' for me?

LAZARUS

Anything.

CUT TO:

LAZARUS

(takes another drink)

Ain't played 'fore nobody in years.

LAZARUS

(plays as he remembers)

Funny how a sound just speak to ya

heart.

LAZARUS

(thinks)

Wanted me some kids. A whole mess of

'em. But Rose, my wife... chil'ren

was for another time.

(takes a drink)

They's this one spring... I saw a

change in her. Her breasts start

swellin' up. Come a few mornings I

hear her heavin' in the bathroom. I

seen it with women before. I knew.

LAZARUS

Come a day, Rose say she had to go

visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't

want me to come... so I stayed put.

(remembers)

When she come back...

(hesitates)

They talk about a woman havin' that

glow. Couldn't see it no more. She...

took it away. Cut it out.

LAZARUS

One night... While she sleepin'.

Held a pillow in my hands. I could

see myself killin' her. What evil in

my heart make me wanna kill her, I

don't know? It's that voice in me.

Each time I think it's gone, he come

howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't

know. But I am a haunted man.

LAZARUS

Calls me when I'm ailing. When I

can't find my home, lost in the pines.

I calls it the Black Snake Moan.

(he closes his eyes

and sings)

Mm-mm... Got no momma now.Mm-mm...

Got no momma now.It's over late last

night, don't need no momma now.

RAE

Sing, Lazarus.

(kneels next to him

in fear)

Please keep singin'.

LAZARUS

(singing)

Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my

room.Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin'

in my room.Some pretty momma better

come and get this black snake soon.

LAZARUS

(singing)

Black snake is evil, black snake is

all I see.Black snake is evil, black

snake is all I see.Woke up this

mornin', black snake moved in on me.

LAZARUS

My life is gone. Only life I was

livin'. And I lost it.

RAE

I'm here with you.

LAZARUS

I had love in my heart. And I gave

it to one woman. And she gone now.

(his lip quivers)

Where am I gonna put all this love?

RAE

You can give it to me.

RAE

You can't start this and not finish.

Not with me.

(kisses him)

Please...

LAZARUS

Wait... I gotta stop...

(Rae's kisses get

more aggressive)

Rae stop...

(she can't hear, the

burning has her)

Dammit, Rae... GET OFF!

LAZARUS

This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry.

RAE

Not gonna lie to you, Laz...

(labored breath)

This one's a doozy. I don't think...

I don't think I can stop this.

LAZARUS

Tell me what to do.

RAE

(Barely able to speak)

The... chain helps.

RAE

I seen a man die. He couldn't

breathe... his heart was... was givin'

out.

LAZARUS

You just havin' a fit. You ain't

goin' nowhere.

RAE

He told me... get help. I just stood

there and watched him... I watched

him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!

RAE

(like a little girl)

Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me

so many times.

LAZARUS

No one's gonna hurt you no more.

RAE

You think God forgives people like

that?

(crying like a child)

You think God forgives people like

me?

RAE

Hold me. Oh God...

LAZARUS

We'll just stay here. Wait till it

passes.

FADE TO BLACK.

RAE

Where you gonna be?

LAZARUS

Right here. Be here all afternoon.

(waits)

You ready for this?

RAE

I'm gonna just get some girl stuff,

like make-up and... stuff.

LAZARUS

This town ain't goin' nowhere. You

LAZARUS

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANGELA

LAZARUS

(turns and grins)

You liked what I brung ya?

ANGELA

Been eatin' like a princess all week.

Even got enough for us to take a

picnic under the gazebo.

LAZARUS

That'd be nice.

ANGELA

I put on the lotion you got me. Can

you smell it?

LAZARUS

(smells)

That's nice, too.

CUT TO:

RAE

Hey.

SANDY

What happened to your face?

RAE

Got in a little accident.

SANDY

(not believing her)

Yeah.

RAE

Since you workin' on the square now,

maybe we could get some coffee in

the morning, if you want.

SANDY

You need money again?

RAE

No. That's not why...

(a frustrated breath)

Why we always gotta do this? I mean,

you and me been at each other as far

back as I can remember. Wasn't no

love between us. And I'm your

daughter. I'm the only family you

got.

SANDY

You never needed nobody. Always made

that clear to me.

RAE

Yeah. I know I did. But...

(struggles with tears)

I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin'

to... get some peace, you know?

SANDY

I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see

that?

RAE

I just wanted some make-up.

SANDY

All that shit's on aisle 5.

RAE

I just think you should'a kept him

off me, that's all.

SANDY

The hell are you talkin' about?

RAE

Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along

with all you say about me. But that...

you can't pretend no more on that.

Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.

(a terrible silence)

I didn't know about any of that stuff

he was doin' to me.

(tears well up)

And you let him do it. Some big nobody

in your life... and you let him do

as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY

you had.

RAE

I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...

SANDY

All my life I been puttin' out your

fires, with you givin' out your snatch

to every waggin' dick in this town.

And you gonna lay the blame at my

feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.

RAE

But... Momma... just tell me... not

gonna be mad... we can just talk

about it... Be eye to eye on this...

You don't even got to say you're

sorry... Just say how you knew...

SANDY

Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin'

to my parents and having you instead

of doin' what I should'a done.

RAE

...tell me you don't know... goddamn

LIAR!

RAE

SAY IT! JUST FUCKING SAY IT!

MARK

Rae! Rae! What are you doin'?

RAE

(hysterically screaming

and thrashing the

mop)

GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET...

HIM...OFF!

CUT TO:

ANGELA

I's thinkin' about singing in the

choir.

LAZARUS

At church?

ANGELA

Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good

voice or not but... practice is only

LAZARUS

(grinning)

You gonna sing me somethin'?

ANGELA

When? Now? Oh. No.

LAZARUS

Come on, just a little somethin'.

Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.

ANGELA

(singing)

There is a balm in Gilead to make

the wounded whole.

ANGELA

(singing)

There is a balm in Gilead to save my

sick, sick soul.

(opens her eyes, speaks)

So. You think I should be in the

choir?

ANGELA

What? What is it?

LAZARUS

RAE? GAL? YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?

FLASH TO:

FLASH BACK TO:

R.L.

LAZARUS

(singing)

LAZARUS

Yes, I'm goin' Georgia line.

LAZARUS

RAE

(smiling)

RAE

LAZARUS

Don't think that'd be wise.

RAE

LAZARUS

CUT TO BLACK:

ARTY

RAE

ARTY

RAE

RONNIE

clenched teeth)

Box of cereal... well, Goddamn...

(looks at his trembling

fists)

Everybody keeps sayin' things to me

take make me feel great. But I don't

feel great at all. I feel like I'm

comin' outta my skin. Like I'm losin'

control of my mind.

(looks into Rae's

eyes)

I'm not like this. I'm not usually

so... afraid.

(really starts crying)

I don't know what's... wrong...

RAE

RONNIE

find the right note)

You... are my... sunshine.

RAE

LAZARUS

Looks like you know a song.

RAE

Don't know where I learn't it, but...

it's there in my head.

LAZARUS

(playing a tune)

How you feelin' today?

RAE

You know how you feel when you come

out of a bad hangover? Like your

eyes can open a little bit more.

LAZARUS

I know that.

RAE

Woke up real early. Sun was shining.

Just thought I'd mess around, try to

learn a song.

LAZARUS

Go'on and sing it, I'll play.

RAE

No, you do it. I can't sing.

LAZARUS

Stop that foolishness. Just do as I

say and close your eyes.

(Rae closes her eyes)

Close your eyes. And think about...

well, for a song like this, I'd say

you think about what you love.

RAE

What I love.

LAZARUS

Get a good picture in your mind.

LAZARUS

Think on that. And sing wit me.

(Laz comes in singing)

You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.

RAE & LAZARUS

You make me happy when skies are

gray.

You'll never know dear, how much I

love you.

Please don't take my sunshine away.

LAZARUS

Good. I know another. It go like

this.

(sings)

Last night dear, as I lay sleeping.

I dreamed I held you in my arms.

When I awoke dear, I was mistaken.

So I hung my head and I cried.

(to Rae)

Close your eyes Rae... sing it.

RAE

(singing)

You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.

You make me happy when skies are

gray.

RAE

(singing)

You'll never know dear, how much I

RONNIE!

RAE

RONNIE STOP! RONNIE!

RAE

RONNIE

RAE

RONNIE

(to Laz)

Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as

RONNIE

Goddamn it, I ask you a question,

you better answer it, or I'm gonna

blast a hole in ya!

RAE

Ronnie...

RONNIE

YOU SHUT UP!

LAZARUS

Careful how you point that gun, boy.

RONNIE

(points gun back at

Laz)

Or what? OR WHAT?

LAZARUS

Boy? You here to make a point, or

you here to kill somebody?

RONNIE

Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I

blow your face off.

LAZARUS

You sayin' you'll do what?

RONNIE

You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll

fuckin' kill..

LAZARUS

(cutting him off)

BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp

a baby duck.

RONNIE

You testing me? Huh? You testin' me,

old man?

LAZARUS

Test. Shit. What kind'a test you

thinkin'? You mean like, if you a

man or not? If you a killer? Only

one way to prove that. You just look

me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze

that trigger back.

LAZARUS

Ain't that easy, is it? I been in

some scraps, son, I know. First

there's that loud crack. Always louder

than you think. Like it just come-up-

a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder

right in ya hand. BAM!

LAZARUS

White light. Smell of smoke. Taste

of my blood and brains in your mouth,

stingin' ya eyes.

RAE

Oh, baby... just let me...

RONNIE

GODDAMMIT, RAE!

LAZARUS

BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT

ME!

(Ronnie obeys)

You need to kill a man, all you gotta

have is a good reason.

(watches Ronnie fight

his attack)

You know she been here with me, don't

cha? Been all over town, givin' up

that switch you thought was your

own.

RONNIE

SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

LAZARUS

Put all your love and dreams into

one woman... she turn around and

give it all to another man. That's a

good reason to paint the wall with

me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz

there won't be no more question in

her mind. She with a real man now. A

real KILLER!

RONNIE

Don't... don't say that to me...

LAZARUS

(getting fed up)

Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience

to suffer you children and this monkey

junk. I'm too old to play house...

(looks at Rae and

then back at Ronnie)

...and cowboys. So let's have it.

End me or get out of my face!

LAZARUS

Go'on. Do it.

(silence)

DO IT!

RAE

Ronnie?

RONNIE

I can't stop... I can't stop... being

scared. What am I gonna do...

RAE

I got you, baby... I got you...

RAE

(seeing Laz plug the

phone in)

What are you doing?

(Laz dials a number)

You gonna call the cops? You think

they gonna help this? They ever help

you, Laz? Huh?

(Laz listens on the

phone)

DAMMIT LAZ PUT THE PHONE DOWN?

LAZARUS

Thought you knew me better, gal.

(into the phone)

I need you at my house... right now.

CUT TO:

R.L.

(to Ronnie)

I imagine there's a lot of good

between you two. But I want you to

tell me what's bad. Go'on. And don't

hold back.

RONNIE

I hate this town. You can't round

the corner without bumping into

someone who's got your number.

(a brief look at Rae)

We did a lot of dreamin', me and

Rae. Makin' plans to get out. I'd do

my tour and... we'd move outta here.

Go to Chattanooga. And I'd work for

my uncle.

(looks down, tears

come to Ronnie)

But... when Rae gets like she does.

And she does the things that she

always done. Makes me feel like she

loves this place more'n me.

R.L.

Go on, Ronnie.

RONNIE

All my life people called me shit

like, sissy and... nervous and... I

got few things in my life that make

me feel like... like...

LAZARUS

Like a man.

RONNIE

(surprised)

Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel

like a man with her. I wanna feel

like the only man with her.

R.L.

(looks at Rae)

Now, Rae, we're not here to fix you

or judge you. Only you and the

Almighty can do that. But I want you

to tell me about these spells you

get.

RAE

It starts like this... fire... that

spreads. Starts in my head. Then

moves to my stomach. Then it goes

lower. I can stop it sometimes but

mostly I just jump on and ride it

out... then everything'll go back to

normal, you know. Only thing ever

took that feeling away was... was...

when I met Ronnie.

(the emotion really

hits hard)

Cuz I love him so much. He's all I

got in my life that's special. And I

like taking care of him and helping

him when he gets nervous. When I can

do that for him... it's like I'm

givin' somethin' of myself that I

haven't givin' nobody else.

R.L.

Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him

how you feel.

RAE

I think... I think we're fucked up.

Both of us. I know I am. But... that

don't mean what I feel ain't true.

It don't mean I can't love. And I

know, how I been is... is... REALLY

BAD! So if you want to quit on me...

I understand. But please... please...

don't.

R.L.

So. What'chu two gonna do about this?

CUT TO:

ANGELA

Hey.

LAZARUS

Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that

nosey gal up at the counter give me

ANGELA

What do you need?

LAZARUS

I need ya help again.

ANGELA

More cough syrup?

LAZARUS

Can I come in?

LAZARUS

I lied to you. It was wrong. But at

the time... I didn't know what to

do. Imagine you got an earful from

folks about that gal I's carryin'...

ANGELA

Laz... you don't need to explain

yourself to me...

LAZARUS

Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean

to say...

(long pause)

I got feelings for you. And I didn't

want you to think... I didn't...

(how to say?)

I don't want you to go away. There's

better ways to say what I'm trying

to say, but... they it is. Don't go

away.

ANGELA

Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you.

I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well

I can get hurt like this. And I have

been hurt. Just like you.

(beat)

Woman like me, I got a lot of livin'

to do. But my days are precious to

me. They all I got left. Don't want

no more fuss. I want love in my life.

You understanding me, Laz?

LAZARUS

I do. God's truth. I do.

ANGELA

Now what'chu need me to do? Cuz I'm

gonna go do it.

CUT TO:

TEHRONNE

Yo, this here Pinetop. I think he

got what you lookin' for.

LAZARUS

That'll do.

TEHRONNE

It got some miles on it, but my boys

say she run good. Got fresh 22's on

her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how

it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody

gonna come lookin' for it. I got the

pinks... got no problem.

(hands Laz the keys)

Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no

bus.

LAZARUS

(moved, impressed)

Don't see generosity much these days.

Everything always got a catch. Guess

I'm tryin' to say... thank you.

TEHRONNE

Nobody ever asks me to do shit like

this for people. And you know what?

I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?

CUT TO:

ANGELA

What are you doing?

RONNIE

(shrugs)

Just wanted to see.

ANGELA

You know the rules.

(vacant look from

Ronnie)

You do know the rules, don't you?

RONNIE

Yeah, I know.

ANGELA

Then start taking them seriously.

RONNIE

Yes, ma'am.

ANGELA

It's okay to breathe, honey.

RAE

Yes, ma'am.

CUT TO:

LINCOLN

You Ronnie?

RONNIE

Yeah.

LINCOLN

I'm Lincoln. Guess I'm gonna be your

best man.

RONNIE

(ultimately accepting)

Okay.

LINCOLN

You havin' trouble with that tie?

Cuz I'm pretty good at it.

LINCOLN

Gotta do it like this or I get all

turned around.

ANGELA

She's ready for you.

LAZARUS

Now that's sharp. That's real sharp.

Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't

she? You like it?

RAE

I've had nice things before but I

always ruined 'em somehow.

LAZARUS

Well, this one's yours now. You ready

to take care of it?

RAE

I want to. More'n anything. But I...

LAZARUS

Now... let's stop that.

(smiles)

You and me... we can handle this.

You hear me, gal? We gonna be just

fine. Now live ya life. Pull your

shit together and live your life.

RAE

Okay.

RAE

I don't want you to let go.

LAZARUS

Maybe I won't.

R.L. (V.O.)

When I was a child, I talked like a

child. I thought like a child, I

reasoned like a child.

CUT TO:

R.L. (V.O.)

When I became a man, I put childish

ways behind me.

R.L. (V.O.)

Now we see but a poor reflection as

in the mirror; then we shall see

face to face. I know in part; then I

shall know fully, even as I am fully

known.

R.L. (V.O.)

And now these three remain: faith,

hope and love. But the greatest of

these is love.

(Looks to Laz)

Who gives this girl in marriage?

LAZARUS

I do.

LAZARUS

You got her now?

R.L.

Ronnie. Rae. I want you to look at

each other and listen to me carefully.

Do you understand?

RAE & RONNIE

Yes. Yes, sir.

R.L.

I require and charge you both as you

stand in the presence of God to

remember that love and loyalty alone

will avail as a foundation of a happy

and enduring home.

(to Lincoln)

Go on, hand it to him.

R.L.

No human ties are more tender. No

vows more sacred than those you now

assume.

R.L.

If these solemn vows be kept

inviolate, the home which you are

establishing will abide in peace and

your life will be filled with joy.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

I gotta pull over.

RONNIE

(through clenched

teeth)

FUCK!

FLASH TO

FLASH BACK TO:

RAE

(singing)

You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.

You make me happy, when times are

gray.

RAE

(singing)

You'll never know dear, how much I

love you.

Please don't take, my sunshine away.

RAE

See. We're okay.

CUT TO BLACK:

THE END
