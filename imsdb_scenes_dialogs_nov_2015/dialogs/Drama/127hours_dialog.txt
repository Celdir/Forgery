Hey. Are you doing the east pike?

Can I come along with you for a

while?

ARON (CONT'D)

I'm on my own. I'm Aron.

CUT TO:

KRISTI

(looking at Megan)

Sure, I'm Kristi.

MEGAN

Megan.

ARON

Nice to meet you. What a day.

KRISTI

It's beautiful.

ARON

Did you bike or come straight from

the trail head?

KRISTI

We left the car there. Pretty

quiet.

ARON

I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon

and biked here.

7.

MEGAN

You biked from Horseshoe? That's

20 miles or more.

ARON

17 and windy.

ARON (CONT'D)

I do this a lot.

ARON (CONT'D)

Wasn't expecting to see anyone in

the canyon today.

MEGAN

Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up

like that.

ARON

Sorry.

MEGAN

It's kind of nervy seeing a lone

guy walking up to you in the middle

of the desert.

ARON

Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one

around for 50 miles.

KRISTI

... and suddenly there's a guy

right behind you and `wait a

minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY

MASK!'

ARON

Let me guess... You're here for

the paintings or the Cathedral?

KRISTI

The Cathedral? We've got a bit

disorientated and the map isn't

great. Where is it?

ARON

The climb's a little tricky but

it's worth it.

KRISTI / MEGAN

We climb.

8.

CUT TO:

ARON

There's thousands of holds but you

can't see them until you're almost

upside down and then they just keep

appearing... it's a bit of a act of

faith so I'll go first... take off

as much as you dare as there's a

bit of a surprise at the other

end...

MEGAN (O.S.)

You behave Aron Ralston or we'll

tell your mother all about where

you lure girls...

ARON

I swear I won't look but I swear

you won't care when you get out

here...

ARON (CONT'D)

... and the thing is, when you get

to the middle...

ARON (CONT'D)

... there aren't any more.

KRISTI

OMG!

CUT TO:

MEGAN

Are you ok? ARON!

KRISTI

Of course he's ok. Listen to him.

KRISTI (CONT'D)

Got to be there, Meg.

CUT TO:

MEGAN

We've got to go again. And film

it!

CUT TO:

MEGAN

I really can't eat all this

chocolate by myself... Never mind,

yes I can!

KRISTI

So have you got a girlfriend, Aron?

ARON

Well, there's not really anyone

special.

MEGAN

Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends.

KRISTI

There's always a girl, you just

don't know it yet.

10.

MEGAN

Yeah, we meet lots of guys and

there's always a girl.

ARON

Long story.

KRISTI

With lots of characters in it.

CUT TO:

ARON (V.O.)

I've done 46 of the 59 winter solo

ascents.

MEGAN

Wow, highest person in Colorado.

ARON

Well I figure no one else is mad

enough to climb in the winter.

KRISTI

... you can be the highest person

on the continent!

CUT TO:

MEGAN

Didn't you see it?

ARON

What? No.

MEGAN

Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's

house - the roof's caved in and

someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on

the side. Smelled weird though.

ARON

Just like a MOTEL 6 then?

CUT TO:

11.

KRISTI

Why are you on your own?

ARON

Solitude. Great tunes. Empty

mind.

ARON (CONT'D)

And I can sing Phish songs as loud

as I like.

MEGAN

Phish?

KRISTI

Not those guys from...

ARON

Yeah, I know, I know.

(LAUGHS)

See, that's why I'm on my own.

Nobody likes me or my band.

ARON (CONT'D)

I'll get this. Leave no trace.

CUT TO:

ARON (CONT'D)

Hey, but I like a beer like the

next man. You know, end of the day.

CUT TO:

ARON

I'm not certified yet but that's

what I want to do.

MEGAN

An illegal instructor.

12.

ARON

It's hard to get the hours to

qualify. Catch 22.

KRISTI

Well, we'll sign your time-card

today.

ARON

Great. Now put your ass on my head.

KRISTI

Okay but don't look and no grabbing

now, if I do...

MEGAN

Oh whatever, you love it.

KRISTI

Shhh!

ARON

(at his most instructor-

ish, talking all the time

as he makes his way down)

You'll have to chimney down a

little ways - like here, watch -

one foot on each wall then squat

onto your right heel, now your

butt's on the wall, so you can move

your right foot across, now put

your left foot under your butt

lower down and scootch your butt

down - watch that black part, it's

slick, slime, try not to get it on

your shoes - if you can get to

these bomber handholds here it's

like an elevator shaft and just

think friction to control the

slide. This is a keeper so always

have someone at the bottom to boost

you out.

MEGAN

I didn't understand any of that.

13.

MEGAN (CONT'D)

Kristi, I think this is our way

back.

ARON

Why don't you come with me to the

Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a

lift back to your car.

KRISTI

How far is it?

ARON

About another 8 miles or so, I

think.

MEGAN

You'll never get out before dark.

ARON

No, I really got to do this. Anyway

I've my miner's lamp.

MEGAN

You don't climb at night, do you?

ARON

No, it's great for seeing snakes in

hand holds. Can I get a picture

then?

ARON (CONT'D)

Listen, my friends are having a

party tomorrow night. You should

come.

KRISTI

Yeah, we'd like that. What time?

MEGAN

Where?

ARON

Drive on the east road and about 40

miles out there's a huge inflatable

Scooby Doo. You can't miss it.

Turn off and it's about 2 miles

down that track. Starts late and

it'll go right thru.

14.

KRISTI

Come on Aron, hike out with us -

we'll go get your truck, hang out

and have a beer.

ARON

No, I really got to do this.

KRISTI

Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah?

ARON

That's the one. I'll have 3 cold

beers waiting for us.

MEGAN

12 cold beers!

" SUNDAY ":

CUT TO:

ARON

It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This

marks my twenty-four-hour mark of

being stuck in Blue John Canyon

above the Big Drop. My name is

Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna

and Larry Ralston of Englewood,

Colorado. Whoever finds this,

please make an attempt to get this

to them. Be sure of it. I would

appreciate it.

ARON (CONT'D)

So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon

yesterday... and this happened.

INTERCUT WITH:

CUT TO:

ARON

What you're looking at there is my

arm, going into the rock... and

there it is, stuck. It's been

without circulation for 24 hours.

(MORE)

30.

ARON (CONT'D)

It's pretty well gone. If the

colour doesn't come across on the

video, it's grey and blue.

ARON (CONT'D)

Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff.

ARON (CONT'D)

So I have very little water.

ARON (CONT'D)

Yeah, I have about a third of a

litre left.

INTERCUT WITH:

CUT TO:

ARON

So the way I see it... there's kind

of four things happening here... I

tried to move it with some

rigging... useless... and I tried

chipping away at the rock... I

think part of the problem is, is

that my hand is actually supporting

the rock. Which means every time I

chip away the rock moves a bit and

settles onto my hand again. I

can't feel it happening but

microscopically, it seems to be,

because the little gap over there

between the rock and the wall seems

to be getting smaller. And this

chockstone is the hardest thing

here.

CUT TO:

31.

CUT TO:

ARON

So the third thing left was to cut

my arm off.

PAUSE

ARON (CONT'D)

I don't know whether I could do

that but it's pretty much suicide.

It's four hours to my vehicle that

way and with very difficult

climbing with one hand and the bike

is like two, two and a half hours,

that way but the climbing... fourth

class climbing... which I think

will be probably impossible with

one hand... between the blood loss

and the dehydration I think I would

die if I cut off my arm.

ARON (CONT'D)

Which means I'm waiting for someone

to come along.

ARON (CONT'D)

I didn't tell anyone where I was

going and I didn't leave a note on

the truck.

ARON (CONT'D)

Please show me a sign.

ARON (CONT'D)

OK, then, God, since you're

apparently busy: Devil, if you're

listening, I need some help here.

I'll trade you my arm, my soul,

whatever you want. Just get me out

of here. You want me never to

climb again, I can give that up.

ARON

I have about one hundred and fifty

millilitres of water left. That's

four ounces. I can't believe it

but I peed twice today, within a

few minutes of each other. How is

this possible? It's two days since

I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to

go so quickly I forgot to save the

first. I saved the second in the

CamelBak. Will I drink it? It

smells foul, and hot but it'll

settle. And I can chill it in the

sand in the night. It's like Polar

winter here for nine hours.

ARON

No number twos. Which will

disappoint my insect friends.

They're gonna have to wait. The

sunlight appears down here for a

few hours. I get 15 minutes of it

at 9.35... and apart from chipping

away uselessly at this rock that's

pretty much my morning routine.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VIDEO:

ARON

I keep chipping at the rock but

just to generate warmth and give me

something to do. I think it's

making it worse. I know it's

settling more on my arm as I remove

material from it. The area where I

chipped flakes off yesterday has

already rotated down onto my arm.

PAUSE. I can't feel anything.

PAUSE. So I made a great

tourniquet and I tried to cut it

off.

ARON

The blades are too blunt even to

break the skin. I guess that's the

chipping. It's not even a proper

LONG PAUSE.

Sis. Sonja, I'm very proud of you.

ARON (CONT'D)

I didn't get to hear firsthand how

your championships went, but I

heard from Mom that you placed very

well at the national competitions,

that you were tenth overall in

speech and debate in the nation.

Hot damn, girl. I'm very proud of

you. Not just for that but for who

you are.

ARON (CONT'D)

I can imagine you in your living

room looking back at me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ARON

I've been thinking about what my

friend Rob in Aspen says to me

several... frequently.. Several times

that, confusingly,

'It's not what you do but who you

are'.

I kind of got hung up on that a

lot, because I always thought who I

was, was very much wrapped up with

what I did. That I was happy

because of the things that I did

that made me happy. If things you

do make you happy, then they can

also make you unhappy. I think

that's why I found myself being as

ambitious and energetic -

ARON

Good morning everyone! It's 6:45

Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The

weather is great! I figure by now

that Leona, my housemate - Hi

Leona! - has missed me hopefully

since I didn't show up last night.

Another hour and a half they'll

miss me for not showing up for

work. Hi Brion at work! Best case

scenario is they notify the police

and after a 24 hour hold they file

a report, a missing persons report.

Which means noon tomorrow it's

official that I'm gone. I do still

have the tiniest bit of water left.

Well, actually, I've resorted...I've

had a couple pretty good gulps of

urine that I saved in my Camelbak.

I sorta let it distill...it tastes

like hell. So it's 70 hours since

I left on my bike from Horseshoe

Trailhead during which time I have

consumed 3 liters of water and a

couple mouthfuls of piss.

Did I say the weather is great?

Well, it is. Though flash floods

potential is still present. There's

4-prong major canyons upstream from

me that all converge in this 3 foot

wide gap where I am. The rock I

pulled down on top of me, it was

put there by flood.

PAUSE

Still, I'd get a drink.

ARON (CONT'D)

Mom, Dad, I really love you guys.

I wanted to take this time to say

the times we've spent together have

been awesome. I haven't appreciated

you in my own heart the way I know

I could. Mom, I love you. I wish

I'd returned all of your calls,

ever.

ARON (CONT'D)

I made an attempt - a short career

in surgery, as it turned out -

those knives are just not anywhere

close to the task. I've got about

an inch-wide gash in my arm that

goes about a half inch deep. I cut

down through the skin and the fatty

tissue, and through some of the

muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but

I'm not sure.

I'll never saw through the bones

with this knife. I tried, anyways.

It really just didn't go well. The

tourniquet is relaxed at this

point. Which actually is a little

bothersome, considering I'm not

bleeding that bad, barely at all.

It's so weird. You'd expect to

definitely see more pulsing and

bleeding, but oh well.

ARON (CONT'D)

I hate this fucking canyon.

ARON (CONT'D)

I hate this cold slab pressing me

against this damp fucking wall.

ARON (CONT'D)

I know there's water near coz of

these fucking mosquitoes.

ARON (CONT'D)

I hate this fucking mess.

ARON (CONT'D)

ARON (CONT'D)

Hang in there Aron.

ARON (CONT'D)

My name is Aron Ralston. I was

trapped by a boulder on Saturday

and I've been without food and

water for 5 days. I cut my arm off

this morning to get free and I've

lost a lot of blood. I need medical

attention.

(Erik's English is almost

perfect, although

accented and without

humour. His family sit

beside him on comfortable

chairs in a TV studio.

They are very pleased to

BE THERE)

ERIK

We are the Mejers from Holland. At

the start of the trailhead we

talked to a ranger who told us

about a car that was parked in the

area already for several days and

that the owner might be missing in

the canyon. We joked that we would

keep our eyes open and that we

would try to find him.

After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to

the Great Gallery (Indian rock art)

where we took some pictures, we

returned and suddenly heard a noise

behind us, and after that a voice

that cried "Help, I need help".

Monique and I immediately realized

that this had to be the missing

person.

ERIK (CONT'D)

We didn't find him, he found us!

We gave him our water and Oreos.

CUT TO:

ERIK

We are the Mejers from Holland.

You should stop and rest.

ARON

No, we need to keep hiking.

We need a helicopter - who can run

fastest?- You, go now fast. Take

him.

ERIK

They told us you were here.

ARON

Who? Who told you?

ERIK

The police at the parking lot

ARON

Do you have a phone?

ERIK

There's no signal for miles.

ARON

Do you have a cell phone?

WAYNE

No. I'm Wayne. I have some medical

training.

ARON

Is it ok for me to drink so much

water?

74.

WAYNE

Sure so long as it doesn't make you

vomit.

WAYNE (CONT'D)

(TO ERIK)

Make sure he doesn't pass out.

ARON

I gotta stop and empty my shoes.

You'll have to tie my shoe lace.

CUT TO:

PILOT

Are you Aron?

ARON

Yes I am. Can I get a lift?

CUT TO:

ARON

I'm gonna make a terrible mess of

your seat.

PILOT

Just get in buddy. We're all

looking for you.

OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs

and the tickets and he'll be

ARON

So are you guys ok with me?

RANA

Yeah. We split up a while back when

you were in hospital.

ARON

Christine told me.

RANA

(always to the point)

Is that what this is about?

ARON

Yeah.

RANA

What about the climbing?

78.

RANA (CONT'D)

Solo?

ARON

I'm gonna finish the 49ers this

winter or next.

RANA

(to change it)

Well, all I can't figure out is

what took you so long to cut it off

and get one of these.

ARON

Rana, before I did it I was

hallucinating, I saw this child, a

little blond boy -

RANA

(over her glasses)

Not Jesus please...

ARON

No, he looked like my cousin

Charlie but way too young... and I

didn't know why but I knew he was

mine and that this was what lay in

front of me.

ARON (CONT'D)

But it's not going to be you, is

it?

RANA

No Aron, it's not.

ARON

(HE KNOWS)

OK.

RANA

You know, everyone who cares for

you, a little bit of them dies each

time you go back.

79.

RANA (CONT'D)

Let's go hero. If they do The Fly

first and we miss it we'll never be

forgiven.
