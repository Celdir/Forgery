LORD OF WAR

Written by

Andrew Niccol

YURI

There are over 550 million firearms in

worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm

for every twelve people on the planet.  The

only question is...

(taking a draft and stubbing out

the cigarette)

...how do we arm the other eleven?

UKRAINIAN OFFICER

(to his SUBORDINATE carrying a

manifest, in Ukrainian)

Call it "agricultural machinery".

Odessa, U.S.S.R - 1980

YURI (V.O.)

I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of

Odessa in a country that no longer exists.

You might have heard of it - a little place

called the Soviet Union.

YURI

(in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over

the idealist's shoulder)

All property is theft.

YURI (V.O.)

Where I grew up, everyone was equal.  Some

were just more equal than others.

YURI

(in subtitled Ukrainian)

Shortages?  What shortages?

YURI (V.O.)

My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my

younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a

war without heroes.  I'd gotten out of military

service due to a heart problem - it wasn't

completely a lie.

RADIO ANNOUNCER

(impossibly upper-crust British

accent)

--Finally, in response to human rights

protests and in an effort to encourage the

United States to sell grain to the Soviet

Union after two successive crop failures, it

is reported that the politburo has consented

to permit a limited number of Jews to

emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel.

(beat)

And that concludes this edition of news from

the BBC World Service.

ANATOLY

(incredulous)

Trading Jews for grain.

VITALY

(reaching for a banana)

It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.

IRINA

(shrugs)

Good for the Jews.

YURI

And us.

YURI (cont'd)

(matter-of-fact)

We're Jewish.

VITALY

(scoffing)

We're not Jewish.

YURI

(shrug)

We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.

ANATOLY

Mazeltov.

YURI (V.O.)

There have been few occasions in the

twentieth century when it's been an

advantage to be a Jew.

YURI (V.O.)

The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my

first forged document.  Little about my life

has been kosher ever since.

YURI (V.O.)

We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed

for Israel but I didn't see much of the

country on that first trip.

YURI (V.O.)

Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent

of us ended up in that other "promised

land".

"Little Odessa", New York - 1984

YURI (V.O.)

We congregated in New York's Brighton Beach

because of its similarity to the Crimean

Sea.  I've always thought it's appropriate

we moved next door to the circus.

YURI (V.O.)

I had no idea my father would take his

assumed identity so much to heart.  I guess

he just stayed in character.

ANATOLY

(glaring at the plate,

incredulous)

How many times--I can't eat shellfish.  It's

"treyf".

IRINA

You're not Jewish.

ANATOLY

I like it.

(picking up his felt fedora)

I like the hat - to remind us there's

something above us.  I like that.

ANATOLY (cont'd)

I'm going to temple.

IRINA

You're not going to temple.  You go to

temple more than the rabbi!

YURI (V.O.)

I was suffering an identity crisis of my own.

YURI (V.O.)

My gift for languages made me highly sought

after.  The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily

recruiting Russian immigrants.

YURI (V.O.)

Naturally, I went with the U.N.  They were

paying more.

YURI (V.O.)

The fastest way to find out you can't change

the world is to actually go there.

Gbamga, Liberia - 1985

YURI (V.O.)

West Africa's Liberia, or "land of the

free", was originally established in the

1800's as a homeland for freed American

negroes.  It's been enslaved by one dictator

or another ever since.  They even copied

their masters' Southern architecture.

YURI (V.O.)

It was my first meeting with the American-

educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste.  While

the warning signs were all there, no one had

any idea what a monster he would eventually

become.  I certainly didn't think he would

become my friend.

U.N. ENVOY

(referring to the meager pile

of weapons)

--With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you

don't seriously expect us to believe that

this represents your entire arsenal.

U.N. ENVOY (cont'd)

This is making a nonsense of the embargo

ratified by all five permanent members of

the Security Council.  The escalation in the

build up of arms jeopardizes not only order

in the region but ultimately world order.

BAPTISTE

(playing to the gallery)

--World order?  You say we jeopardize world

order?

BAPTISTE (cant'd)

Your idea of world order is when you're

giving the orders to the world.

BAPTISTE (cant'd)

Excuse me.

BAPTISTE

(irritated by Yuri's presence)

I am only going to the restroom.

YURI

(shrug)

Orders.

BAPTISTE

(aside to his bodyguards as he enters)

This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?

BAPTISTE

(taunting Yuri)

Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?

YURI

(glancing towards the urinal)

Doesn't look like a job for two men.

BAPTISTE

You know you are fighting a losing battle,

my young friend.  War is nature.  If you

take away the guns, we will kill each other

with knives.  Take away the knives, we will

kill each other with sticks.  Take away the

sticks, we will kill each other with your

peace treaties.

(turning to face Yuri)

You cannot stop this bath of blood.

YURI

It's not "bath of blood".  It's, "blood

bath".

BAPTISTE

Thank you.  But I like it my way.

M.C.

(battling the microphone's

feedback)

And now, we have a surprise for you.  The

83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud

to present, all the way from El Salvador,

the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova.

U.N. PEACEKEEPERS

(chanting to Ava)

Take it off, baby!  Take it off!

AVA

(referring to the sea of U.N.

berets)

Baby blue.  My favorite color!

AVA (cant'd)

I suppose I could give you the speech about

"my hope for world peace" but I have a

feeling you don't want to hear that today.

U.N. PEACEKEEPER

(calling out)

My hope is for a piece of your ass!

AVA

(laughing it off)

I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed

tonight, darling, but you can take her.

AVA (cant'd)

You're all doing a great job - keep it up.  Enjoy the

show!

U.N. PEACEKEEPER

Ava!  Ava!

MANAGER

Don't touch what you can't afford.

U.N. PEACEKEEPER

(regretting indulging the fantasy)

Let's get drunk.

MONROVIAN GIRL

(referring to the money)

What's this?

YURI

(explaining the tip)

For the smile.

YURI

(mixing English and French)

Fuck, no, no, no, no--fuck, no.  Money?  You

want money?

(going through his pockets,

he starts pulling out loose bills)

Fuck, no.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot me.

Fuck.  U.S. dollars.

(referring to the face on a five

dollar bill)

President Lincoln.

LIBERIAN MAN

(in flawless English)

Glock .45.

LIBERIAN MAN (cont'd)

(referring to the face on a twenty

dollar bill)

Jackson.

YURI

What?

LIBERIAN MAN

President Jackson.

YURI

No.

LIBERIAN MAN

(misinterpreting him)

You are driving a hard bargain.

YURI

(flabbergasted)

No, keep it.  Keep the money.  Keep the gun.

LIBERIAN MAN

(offended)

What do you take me for - a thief?

LIBERIAN MAN

Demand and supply.

(referring to the gun)

There is more I am thinking where this comes

from.

YURI

(incredulous)

You want more Glocks?

LIBERIAN MAN

And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.

YURI

What makes you think I'll do that?

LIBERIAN MAN

(quizzical)

I will come back and shoot you with the

Glock.

(checking the magazine, referring

to the bullets)

By the way, do you have the hollow point

cartridges?

YURI

(facetious, nodding to the gun)

You got any color preference for that?

LIBERIAN MAN

(missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun)

Kelly green.

(meeting Yuri's eye)

I will find you.

YURI (V.O.)

He'd come to the right place - peacekeepers

are armed to the teeth.  And nothing but

premium product.  The U.N. mostly buys from

Switzerland - where else?

VIVIAN

(between heavy breaths)

What are we doing here, Yuri?

YURI

(kissing her nipple)

Whatever you want.

VIVIAN

You know what I mean.  Here, in this

country.  Are we doing any good?

YURI

(finally telling her what she

wants to hear)

Would nothing be better?

YURI (V.O.)

The starting salary for a U.N. interpreter

back then was $32,000.  I made fifty K on

"misplaced" weapons on that one trip alone.

I doubt the Secretary General noticed.  The

U.N. spends more on lunch.

YURI (V.O.)

My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect

preparation for war.

IRINA

(calling after him)

Who are you?  You're not my son.  My son

doesn't own such a suit.

YURI

You know who's going to inherit the earth?

YURI (cont'd)

Arms dealers - because everybody else is too

busy killing each other.

VITALY

(regarding his brother)

It's a hell of a fucking career move.

YURI

That's the point.  I've seen how the world's

coming apart.

VITALY

And you want to help with that?

YURI

You can't stop it.

(warming to his theme)

It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep,

sleep with each other and what else?  Fight.

The oldest human skeletons have spearheads

in their rib cages.

VITALY

What do you know about guns?

YURI

(joking darkly)

I know which end I'd rather be on.

(adopting a serious tone)

Every day there are people shooting at each

other.  I think to myself, what guns are

they using?  Why not mine?

VITALY

(hesitant)

I don't know.

YURI

(pressing his argument)

Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no

fucking chef.  I can eat here for free and I

still don't eat here.  You're doing nothing

with your life.

VITALY

Maybe doing nothing's better than doing

this.

(referring to an image

of a gun)

Yuri, I've actually fired one of these

things.

YURI

That's why I need you.

(coaxing)

Brothers in arms.

ANATOLY

(pleasantly surprised)

Finally getting in touch with what's

important, my Son?

YURI

(simply)

Yes.

YURI (V.O.)

It wasn't God I was trying to get close to.

YURI (V.O.)

Dad's contacts at synagogue landed me my first

Israeli-made Uzis and an introduction to the

biggest of the big guns.

ASIAN BUSINESSMAN

(brochure in hand)

--I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7

surface-to-air missiles.  The older Chinese

model.  Not so effective against modern

military aircraft but deadly if used against

a commercial airliner.  I'm giving them away

at eight-fifty.

YURI (V.O.)

It was the eighties and the Cold War was far

from thawed.  Most of the deals were

government-to-government.  There were some go-

betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly

private club with a lifetime club president.

YURI

That's him.  The guy Eli told me about.  Simeon

Zaharoff.  Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war

- both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the

Falklands.  Hets a fucking legend.  I've got to

talk to him.

YURI

Simeon!  Simeon!

VITALY

(stepping between the bodyguard

and Yuri)

They're talking.

SIMEON

May I help you?

YURI

A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton

Beach Import-Export said to contact you.  I

have a business proposal.  Perhaps we can

discuss it - over a drink.

SIMEON

You're in the wrong place my young friend.

This is no place for amateurs.

YURI

(under his breath in Ukrainian)

Yob tvayu mat.  (Subtitled - Motherfucker.)

YURI (V.O.)

Curious how you always revert to your native

tongue in moments of extreme anger...

YURI (V.O.)

...and ecstacy.

VITALY (O.C.)

Boh...Boh.  Oh, Boh! (Subtitle:  God...God.

Oh, God!)

YURI (V.O.)

Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the-

counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under

sanctions.

Beirut, Lebanon - 1986

YURI (V.O.)

The job wasn't so different trom the U.N.  I

was just as neutral working for the ununited

nations.  An equal opportunity "merchant of

death", I supplied every army but the

Salvation Army.

YURI (V.O.)

We got our start in Lebanon after the

suicide bombing.

YURI (V.O.)

When the United States leaves a war zone,

they generally don't take their munitions.

It costs more to bring it back than buy new

stock.

YURI

I sell by the kilo.

YURI (cont'd)

(shrug)

They're second-hand weapons but they're

still okay.

YURI (V.O.)

For all my language skills, I soon

discovered that what talks best is money.

As long as you can speak dollars, dinars,

drachmas, rubles, rupees, pesos, escudos,

lira, krones, kwanzas, trancs, guilders,

deutshmarks, yen and pounds-fucking-

sterling, you can communicate anywhere in

the world.

YURI

(irritated by the meager amount)

This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking

potatoes.

VITALY

What do we do, go more legitimate?

YURI

No.  More illegal.

VITALY

What I'd give right now for a plate of red

cabbage and potatoes.

YURI

(whisper, motioning for them

to leave)

It's not our fight.

YURI (V.O.)

I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

YURI (V.O.)

I sold to both Pakistan and India in their

fight tor the most inhospitable land on

earth.

YURI

How's it going?

INDIAN COMMANDER

(admiring a new gun)

We're making terrific progress - most

casualties from avalanches and frostbite.

YURI

(uncertain smile)

Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.

YURI (V.O.)

We had our set-backs.  It's not called

gunrunning for nothing.

YURI

(from the boat)

Cannibal, what's going on?

CANNIBAL

Cease fire, man.  Cease fire.  It's over.

YURI

What?!  What do you mean it's over?

CANNIBAL

Truce.  We're friends, man.

YURI

(looking to his unopened crates,

more and more agitated)

Friends?!  You can't be fucking friends.

Last week I spoke to you on the phone.  You

said you would not rest until every last

rebel was dead.  You called them vermin.

You said would piss in their mouths, you

said you would exterminate them like

cockroaches.  Just last week, you said this!

CANNIBAL

(shrug)

That was last week, man.

YURI

Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from

me!

CANNIBAL

Peace, man!

YURI

Fuck you, Cannibal!!

VITALY

(referring to the truck)

Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.

YURI

(nodding in agreement)

At least when they say they're going to have

a war, they keep their word.

YURI (V.O.)

I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when

they were still fighting fellow Russians.

But I never sold to Osama bin Laden.  Not

for any moral grounds.  Back then he was

always bouncing checks.

AFGHANI OFFICIAL

I hope you're not thinking of selling these,

Mr. Orlov.

YURI

(shakes his head)

Personal use.

AFGHANI OFFICIAL

There's a hundred thousand bullets here.

YURI

I'm kind of trigger happy.

YURI (V.O.)

And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept

following me around.  We were as

international as each other.

North of Barranquilla, Colombia - 1989

YURI (V.O.)

Operations like mine provided the only way

for certain regimes to conduct a respectable

war.

YURI (V.O.)

The freighter I was standing on carried 113

tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery

to one of the poorest nations in Latin

America in direct contravention of half a

dozen international arms embargoes.

YURI (V.O.)

To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke

in code.  Rocket launchers were "mothers", the

rockets "children".  Assault rifles were

"apples".  The AK-47 was "the Angel King".

YURI

(into phone)

The Angel King will arrive

tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.

YURI (cont'd)

(into phone)

Yes?...Slow the fuck down--what do you mean,

tipped off?  They know where we are?!  Where

are they?!

YURI (cont'd)

(hanging up)

Forget it.

CAPTAIN

Do we run?

VITALY

We have to get out of here.

YURI

No, no-one's going anywhere.

(to the Captain)

Slow--dead slow.  Buy me time.

YURI (cont'd)

(barking an order to a CREWMAN, referring

to the Panamanian flag)

Get that fucking rag down!

YURI (cont'd)

(trying not to sound too

desperate)

It's Yuri.  I need another handle for this

tub...something in our weight class.

(to an elderly Latin PAINTER,

pointing to the stern)

You, over the side!

(the painter hesitates)

Now!

YURI (cont'd)

Yes, it's got to check out...you got a

shorter name!...what?--Kono?  How do you

spell that?...K-O-N-O.  That's good!

YURI (cont'd)

(to the PAINTER, already blacking

out the name, KRISTOL)

Kono!  K-O-N-O.

YURI (cont'd)

(back into phone)

What are we flying?...Dutch?  Later.

(hanging up, to Vitaly)

Vit, get me a Dutch flag!

YURI (cont'd)

Damn, they're hauling!

YURI (cont'd)

(agitated, grasping the line of

the scaffold)

Faster!  Or I send you in!

(checking the binoculars again)

Faster...and better!

VITALY (O.C.)

(panicked)

Yuri!

VITALY (cant' d)

I don't have Dutch.

YURI

What?!

VITALY

I've got Belgium.

YURI

What the fuck use is that?!

(panicked, gesturing to the stern)

He's painting a name registered in the

fucking Netherlands!

YURI (cont'd)

(mind racing)

You got France?!

VITALY

(confused, finding the tricolor)

Yes, why?

YURI

Turn it on its side.

YURI (cont'd)

That's it!  Everybody look innocent--now!

YURI (V.O.)

They say every man has his price - but not

every man gets it.  Interpol Agent, Jack

Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not

with money.  For Jack, glory was the prize.

VALENTINE

Not exactly "The Love Boat".

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(into phone)

It's clean?...It doesn't look clean.  I'm

boarding.

YURI

(anxious whisper into phone)

It's Yuri.  Phone in a sighting of the

Kristol south of Aruba.

AGENT

(referring to the phone)

Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.

YURI

Nice job.

YURI

(in Spanish)

Hey, pay before you play.

NARC LEADER

(in Spanish)

You're late.

VITALY

Hey, fuck you!

NARC LEADER

(jamming his handgun in Vitaly's

eye socket)

Fuck you!

YURI

(reasoning with the Narc Leader)

No, you don't fuck him--

YURI (cont'd)

No, Vit.  No.

(to the Leader, referring to the

bullets)

Help yourselves.  Free sample.

YURI (V.O.)

The first and most important rule of

gunrunning is never get shot with your own

merchandise.

YURI (V.O.)

The second rule is always ensure you have a

foolproof way to get paid.  Credit card,

check, cash.  Preferably in advance, ideally

to an off-shore account.  It's why I choose

my customers so carefully.  Say what you

like about warlords and dictators, they tend

to have a highly developed sense of order.

They always pay their bills on time.

NARC LEADER

(referring to Yuri's wound)

I apologize for earlier.

YURI

(slight wince)

I understand.

NARC LEADER

It's all there.

YURI

What is this?

NARC LEADER

Six keys of pure.

YURI

(incredulous)

I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller

at Chase Manhattan.

NARC LEADER

(hair-trigger temper flaring

again)

You should be thanking me.

(waving his cell phone)

Have you checked the street price today?

With the seizures at the border last week,

it's jumped thirty percent.

YURI

I sell guns.  I don't sell drugs.

NARC LEADER

(shrug)

Diversify.

YURI

(calling after him)

I've got standards.

VITALY

(staring at their "remuneration")

Now what?

YURI

(sighs, exasperated)

Vit.

YURI (V.O.)

I found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand

miles and 150 grams later in a Bolivian

boarding house.

YURI (O.C.)

Vitaly!  Open this fucking door!

VITALY

(happy - way too happy)

Yuri!

(to the comatose prostitutes)

It's my brother, Yuri.  He's my big brother.

YURI

What the fuck is that?

VITALY

Ukraine.

(indicating the direction he is

going to snort)

I start in Odessa, work my way to the

Crimea--

YURI

(staring at the map, appalled)

--You'll be fucking dead before you reach

Kiev.

VITALY

You fuck!

VITALY (cant'd)

You fucking fuck!

Upstate New York - 1989

YURI

Get out of the car.

YURI (cont'd)

I promised our parents.

VITALY

(desperate eyes)

Please.

YURI

Vitaly, you're going to have a good time.

This is a top place.  Two Ford models

checked in last week and that cute weather

girl's been here since July.

VITALY

Please.

VITALY

(as he wipes his nose)

You're a good brother.

YURI (V.O.)

I never understood what separated the

recreational drug user from the habitual,

the functional addict from the

dysfunctional.  But for the grace of God, it

could have been me snorting lines as long as

the Belt Parkway.

YURI (V.O.)

Vitaly never got completely clean despite

the prayers of my mother...

YURI (V.O.)

...and father.  In fact, my younger brother

was the only reason my father ever had to

question his new religion.

YURI (V.O.)

After Colombia I became a one-man-operation.

A sole proprietor as you say on your tax

return - that is if you're foolish enough to

fill one out.

YURI (V.O.)

By then I'd mastered my craft.  Selling arms

is not so different to selling vacuum

cleaners.  You advertise, pound the

pavement, take orders.

YURI (V.O.)

Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be

a political scientist.  I go by a seven-step

approach.

YURI (V.O.)

One: identity a government and an opposition

where the opposition is ignored.

YURI (V.O.)

Two: Wait for a radical group to break away

from the opposition.

YURI (V.O.)

Three: Immediately approach the radical

group and offer them arms.

YURI (V.O.)

Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the

government that the radical group approached

you and offer the government arms.

YURI (V.O.)

Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach

the radical group and offer them more arms

but now at a higher price.  Increasing

tension is a means of generating demand and

the ideal situation is to sell to both

sides.

YURI (V.O.)

Six: If they start shooting at each other,

the escalation is underway.

YURI (V.O.)

They are consuming small arms and ammunition

and the cash register is well and truly

ringing.

YURI (V.O.)

Seven: Don't forget that the success of a

radical group in one country can inspire a

radical group in a neighboring country.

AGENT

(into phone)

--There's really no one else you'd consider?

Christie and Brooke are both available...not

the right look?  It's just that Ava doesn't

generally do print.

AGENT (cont'd)

However, since you are willing to double her

rate and pay cash in advance.  She loves

working with Herb and you say the campaign

will only be seen in Asia?

(examining a first class plane ticket

Destination: St. Barts)

I certainly can't see her objecting to the

location.

(inspecting an itinerary)

What is the product again...?

YURI

(into phone)

The product?  Er,...Colt .45.

(a beat)

The beer.

YURI (V.O.)

It cost me twenty for the fake booking,

another twelve to buy out the hotel.  You

can't force someone to tall in love with you

but you can sure make ita damn sight

easier.

AVA

(calling to Yuri)

Popular hotel, huh?

AVA (cont'd)

Ava Cordova.

YURI

Yuri Orlov.  What brings you to St. Barts?

AVA

A photo shoot.  At least, that was the plan.

But the photographer's plane got stuck in

Miami.  Hurricane - though there was nothing

in the news.

YURI

(gazing out at the ocean)

Those things can come out of nowhere.

AVA

The job's cancelled and there's no flight

back to New York 'til Tuesday.

YURI

You can hitch a ride with me if you like.

YURI (cont'd)

(picking up his own camera)

In the meantime, why don't I take your

picture?

YURI (V.O.)

In my experience some of the most successful

relationships are founded on lies and

deceit.  Since that's where they usually end

up anyway, it's a logical place to start.

YURI (V.O.)

I nearly went broke trying to convince her I

was anything but.  I knew Ava was not the

kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a

private jet unless you owned the jet.

AVA

(holding her skirt in the wind to

protect her modesty)

This is your plane?

YURI

(shrug)

That is my name.

YURI (V.O.)

Of course I was lying.  The plane was a rental,

like the car and even the suit I was standing

in.  At the last minute, I bribed the crew for

the paint-job.

YURI (V.O.)

Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't

looking anywhere but in my eyes.

YURI

(pretending to be impressed with

the photos)

I had no idea.

YURI (cant'd)

I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.  You must

think me very rude.

AVA

Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a

living.

YURI

(wry grin)

At least you aren't taking them off.

AVA

(smiling at his irreverence)

I would be if half the photographers had

their way.

(shrug)

But I can't complain.  I'm paid to say,

"Cheese".

(meeting his gaze)

What about you?

YURI

Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport -

international air freight mostly.

AVA

What, like UPS or something?

YURI

Something like that.

AVA

(glance to her champagne flute)

Business is good.

YURI

Like you, I can't complain.

AVA

But if you did?

YURI

Well...I don't know.

(reluctant admission)

It's just that I travel all around the world

but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm

going nowhere.

YURI (cont'd)

Here's to...

(raising his glass)

...a hurricane.

YURI (cont'd)

Without it, I'd never have met you.

AVA

This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

AVA (cont'd)

It feels like fate.

YURI

(never averting his eyes)

I don't believe in fate.

AVA

What do you believe in?

YURI (V.O.)

We married in a synagogue to make my father

happy.  In the eyes of my Catholic mother,

it was worse than living in sin.

YURI

(explaining to the guests)

It's traditional.

VITALY

(meekly echoing the remark -joke

badly misfired)

Traditional.

YURI (cant'd)

One more time, Vitaly.

YURI (cont'd)

(reassuring word as he whisks Ava

into the car)

I'm sorry.  I should have said something.

ANATOLY

(touching his yarmulke)

Always remember, son, there's something

above you.

YURI

(looking up, gently joking)

Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal

chandelier.

YURI (cont'd)

Mom, we don't need anything.

IRINA

You need this.

DISSOLVE TO:

New York - December 25, 1991

YURI (V.O.)

I was still living way beyond my means,

mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card

to payoff another.  Anything to keep Ava in

the style to which she had, thanks largely

to me, become accustomed.  Then suddenly all

my Christmases came at once.

ANATOLY

(to Irina, regarding a nativity

scene on a Christmas card)

Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew.

IRINA

Ava, this is too much.

AVA

Yuri likes to spoil you.

AVA

Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy!

ANATOLY

That's my grandson.

AVA

(calling out)

Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son

is doing?

YURI (O.C.)

Tak!  Tak!  Tak-fucking-tak!  (subtitle:

Yes!)

ANATOLY

What the hell's the matter?

YURI

It's over!  It's over!

AVA

What's over?

YURI

The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil

Empire.  Mikhail's saying "no mas".  He's

throwing in the towel.  It's over.

AVA

That's nice.

(referring to Nicolai)

Your son is crawling.

ANATOLY

(contemplating the day's events)

At least there'll be religious freedom.

YURI

I think I'll go back for a visit.

(trying to sound casual)

Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

ANATOLY

(face lighting up)

Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then.

YURI

How is he?

ANATOLY

The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one

of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at

his daughter's wedding, he was roaring

drunk.  He was the only one who survived.

Later they found that alcohol in your blood

resists radiation.

YURI

He's still a General in the army?

ANATOLY

Major General.  He got promoted.  Two of his

rivals were also there that day.  I told you

- he's the luckiest man alive.

YURI

He may be luckier than you think.

ANATOLY

(lowering his voice)

We're not fools, Yuri.  What's between you and

your wife is your own business but I don't

think you're going to Odessa to open a

McDonald's.

(meeting his son's eye)

Is this how you want to be remembered?

YURI

(shrug)

You're only remembered when you're dead.

YURI (cont'd)

I'll bring you back some caviar.

ANATOLY

It's not kosher.

VITALY

Merry fucking Christmas!

ANATOLY

(paternal)

Vitaly, who is this?

ANGEL

Angel.

VITALY

Her name really is Angel.  She's a fairy.

(hoisting Angel)

Let's stick her on top of the Christmas

tree.

VITALY (cont' d)

(at a loss for anything better)

I love you all.

YURI

I'm going back to Ukraine.

VITALY

(maudlin)

I miss Odessa.  I miss you.

YURI

I miss you too.

VITALY (cont'd)

(meeting his brother's eye)

Be careful, Yuri.  Those things you sell,

kill...

(tapping Yuri's chest where his

heart should be)

...inside.

YURI (V.O.)

There's no problem leading a double life.

It's the triple and quadruple lives that get

you in the end.

YURI (V.O.)

Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and

Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the

U.S., but that's another story.

YURI (V.O.)

I also packed five different briefcases

depending on the region of the world I was

visiting.

Izmayil, Ukraine - January, 1992

YURI (V.O.)

The end of the Cold War was the beginning of

the hottest time in arms dealing.  The Wall

had fallen.  The arms bazaar was open.

Those forty-five years had generated the

highest weapons build-up in history.  The

Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the

demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no

enemy.

BORDER GUARD

(in English, checking Yuri's

passport)

Visa?

BORDER GUARD (cont'd)

Cash or check only.

YURI

It's good to be home.

DMITRI

Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man

alive.

DMITRI (cont'd)

What?  Did you think I'd be glowing?  Don't

worry.  You can't catch it.

DMITRI

(referring to the car)

This is the SLK?

YURI

0 - 60 in 4.8.

DMITRI

I can't just sell you government property,

Yuri.  I have to report--

YURI

--Report to who?  Moscow?  As of last week

Moscow is in a foreign country.

DMITRI

(shrug)

New flag, new boss.

YURI

There is no new boss yet.  They're too busy

squabbling over who gets the presidential

holiday home at the Black Sea.

YURI (cont'd)

(talking like an evangelist)

It's beautiful.  The ones who know don't

care any more.  The ones who care don't

know.

(nodding to a safe built

into the floor)

Show me your inventory.

YURI

How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

DMITRI

(referring to the inventory in

his hand)

40,000.

YURI

(looking over Dmitri's shoulder)

Is that a "4"?  It doesn't look like a "4"

to me.  It looks more like a "1".

DMITRI

(missing the point)

No, it's a "4".

YURI

It's whatever we say it is because no one

else knows the difference.

YURI (cont'd)

10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion.  Your

stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.

You should order more from the factory.

DMITRI

Someone will work this out, Yuri.  What

happens then?

YURI

(shrug)

We'll cut them in.  Anyway, what could

happen - you're the luckiest man alive.

YURI (V.O.)

Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more

commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.

It's the world's most popular assault ritle

- a weapon all fighters love.  An elegantly

simple nine pound amalgamation of forged

steel and molded plastic.  It doesn't break,

jam or over-heat.  It will shoot whether its

covered in mud or filled with sand.  It's so

easy, even a child can use it.  And they do.

The Russians put the gun on a coin.

Mozambique put it on their flag.  Since the

end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has

become the Russian peoples' greatest export

- after that comes vodka and suicidal

novelists.  One thing's for sure, no one was

lining up to buy their cars.

YURI (V.O.)

Of course my idea was not entirely unique.

I had rivals.

YURI

He's a friend of mine.

SIMEON

Do you know who the fuck I am?

OFFICER

(thick Ukrainian accent)

Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?

SIMEON

I demand to see your commanding officer.

OFFICER

You don't demand shit.

SIMEON

Just give me back my papers.

OFFICER

(papers clearly visible in his

hand)

What papers?

YURI (O.C.)

You're late, Simeon.

YURI (cont'd)

I invited you for a drink once before.

Perhaps now you will accept my invitation.

BARMAID

(to Yuri, impressed)

You sell guns?

YURI

Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see

my bazooka.

YURI

You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the

world changing too fast?

SIMEON

I am here, aren't I?

YURI

Not all of you, I think.

YURI (cont'd)

You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA,

you can't get that ideology completely out

of your head.  The empire was evil for too

long.

SIMEON

I can't deny, it takes some getting used to.

Last week we were trying to beat their

brains in and now we're going into business

together.

YURI

There's no place in gunrunning for politics

anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists,

rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but

they're not the most regular of customers.

YURI (cont'd)

Of course, you're not a true internationalist

until you've supplied weapons to kill your own

countrymen.

SIMEON

I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket

but there are the other satellite states.

Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead

of cutting each other's throats, it may be

more profitable to work together.  What do

you think?

YURI

I think you are the amateur now.  I think

you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage

- you have a philosophy.  I think you should

go with your instincts - your first

instinct.

YURI (cont'd)

I am the same man who was not good enough

for you before.  I am not good enough for

you now.

SIMEON

The problem with gunrunners going to war is

there's no shortage of ammunition.

YURI (V.O.)

Back then, it was all for sale...

YURI (V.O.)

Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored

personnel carriers, whole tank divisions.

UKRAINE MAJOR

(haggling over the gunships)

--I'll tell you what I'll do.  Buy six, you

get one free.

YURI

What about tech support?

UKRAINE MAJOR

No problem.

YURI

Son, get off there before you get hurt.

UKRAINE MAJOR

(sheepish)

He's the tech support.

YURI

(incredulous)

He's twelve.

UKRAINE MAJOR

Thirteen.  Almost fourteen.

DMITRI

(shrug)

Kids grow up fast around here.

UKRAINE MAJOR

(nodding to the gunship)

He can take it apart in his sleep.

YURI (O.C.)

Who are you?

YURI (cont'd)

(angrily to Dmitri)

I thought we were supposed to be watching

for these checkpoints.

DMITRI

How can I?  You keep selling my helicopters.

You're too greedy, Yuri.

YURI

(anxious)

We have to go back.

DMITRI

We'll be going in reverse.  We can't turn

around for a mile.

YOUNG SOLDIER

They're coming.

DMITRI

We shoot it out?

YURI

(shaking his head)

And start an international fucking incident

- no, no, no.

DMITRI

So we run.

YURI

No.  I've got paperwork.

DMITRI

(protesting)

Not for the gunship.  Yuri, you know the

penalty for sanction-busting - selling a

military helicopter?

YURI

It's not a military helicopter.  It's a

rescue helicopter.

YURI (cant' d)

Get to work, Son.

YURI

Yuri Orlov.

VALENTINE

(flashing ID)

Papers.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(regarding the photo closely)

Mr. Orlov, always in the wrong place at the

right time.  We've met before.  Off the

coast of Colombia.

(feigning memory loss)

What was the name of that freighter - I

can't remember.  Was it the Kono or the

Kristol?

YURI

(hesitates, he's actually forgotten)

The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of

them repeatable in polite company.

YURI (cont'd)

(noting to the gun in his ribs)

The new MP-5.  Do you need a silencer for

that?

VALENTINE

The end-user certificate for this aircraft

states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it

yourself?

YURI

It's for humanitarian missions.

VALENTINE

You're a humanitarian?

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(not buying it for a second)

This is a killing machine.

YURI

Not any more.

DMITRI

(in broken English)

Listen to the nephew.

YURI

Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over.

What can they do with military hardware but

convert to civilian use?

DMITRI

What, yes?

YURI

(trying to lighten the mood)

The only way you could die from this baby is

if a food drop hits you.

VALENTINE

(referring to the missiles)

Also going to Burkina Faso?

YURI

(pointing to the document)

But to a different client at a different

address.

VALENTINE

What do you take me for?  A complete fucking

fool?

YURI

(eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to

his throat)

Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to

tell you your job, I must point out that

when shipped separately the weapons and the

aircraft both comply with the current

Interpol trade standards and practices.

VALENTINE

(incredulous)

You expect me to believe this is a

coincidence?

YURI

I can see how certain people might interpret

it as suspicious but thank God we live in a

world where suspicion alone does not

constitute a crime.

VALENTINE

(tosses the documents on the road)

Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be

seeing a lot of each other.

YURI

I can hardly wait.

VALENTINE

(climbing into his Jeep)

Watch out for the time you don't see me.

BOY

(perfect American accent)

What an asshole.

YURI

(referring to the departing

Simeon)

What was he doing here?

DMITRI

(zipping his pants)

Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on

his way.  He doesn't understand the concept

of loyalty.

DMITRI (cont'd)

Speaking of loyalty, too many people know.

I have to make pay-offs.

YURI

Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left

them in your new car.

DMITRI

Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am

the luckiest man alive.

YURI

(screaming to Dmitri)

Dmit--!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

AVA

(still groggy)

Yes, I'll accept the charges.

YURI

Ava--

AVA

Hey, baby.

(glancing to a clock - 3am)

You forgotten what time it is?

YURI

Sorry.  I, er...

(talking about anything other than

what's on his mind)

How was your audition?

AVA

(resigned smile)

They're going in another direction.  The

direction of someone who can act.

YURI

Don't say that.  You're good.

AVA

And you're biased.

AVA

(sensing something amiss)

Where are you?  Is everything okay?

YURI

Rough day at the office.

AVA

Come home.  We miss you.

YURI

Soon.

(more desperate than he intended)

How's Nicki?

AVA

Asleep in our bed.  It's lonely without you.

AVA (cont'd)

Yuri, what's that?

YURI

A party.

AVA

It's always a party where you are.

YURI

I'd better go.  I just wanted to call--hear

your voice.  Kiss Nicki for me.

AVA

I love you.

YURI (V.O.)

In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of

arms have been stolen and re-sold.  One of

the greatest heists of the 20th Century.

YURI (V.O.)

The primary market was Africa.  Eleven major conflicts

involving 32 countries in the past decade - a

gunrunner's wet dream.

YURI (V.O.)

My best customer was self-declared president

of Liberia, Andre Baptiste.  Even though

we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet

him again.  He'd gotten a reputation for

routinely hacking off the limbs of those who

opposed him.  His seven-year civil war has

been described as "a relentless campaign of

sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to

those unfamiliar with the details of man's

capacity to visit the abyss."  That kind of

sums up Andy for me.

ANDRE JNR.

Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior.  My

father would like to meet you.

YURI

Thank him but I have other business.  A busy

schedule.

ANDRE JNR.

It is not optional.  My father is easily

offended.

YURI

What do you know?  My schedule just freed up.

YURI (V.O.)

But if I thought I was scared of Andre

Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.

Like father, like son.  The guava doesn't

fall too far from the tree.  He was a heavy-

drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for

cheerleaders and a lover of fast American

automobiles which he drove recklessly and

with total impunity around the streets of

the capital.  Oh yes, he was also a

cannibal.  They say Andre would eat a

victim's heart while it was still beating to

give him superhuman strength.  I could've

told him he'd get the same effect from a

pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.

YURI (V.O.)

Monrovia itself was like being on another

planet.  Planet Monrovia.  From the

temperature it was obviously a planet close

to the sun.  I rarely saw another white man

even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the

"Little Kremlin".  And I never left town

alone.  Outside town, was the edge of hell.

I didn't want to even gaze into it.

ANDRE JNR.

This is your hotel.

(proudly)

Two stars.

ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)

(to Yuri)

Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

YURI

Part One, Two or Three?

ANDRE JNR.

(confused)

I have only seen Part One.

YURI

(nodding)

The M60.  You want the attachable grenade

launcher?

ANDRE JNR.

Please.  And the armor piercing bullets.

(revving the car)

I will be back to get you in an hour...or

two.  It's Liberia.

(mischievous smile)

We left a welcoming present in your room.

HOTEL PORTER #1

(never averting his eyes from the

screen)

My God, he nearly cut off her head.

HOTEL PORTER #2

When I get to America, I will not live in

Brentwood.

YURI (V.O.)

In the most AIDS infested region of the

globe, where one in four is infected,

Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young

Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and

no condom within a hundred miles.

GLORIA

Hello, Mr. Yuri.

FAITH

We'd be happy to make you happy.

GLORIA

Don't worry, we don't have anything.

YURI

How do you know?

FAITH

Do we look like it?

YURI

(fending them off but with little

commitment)

What if I have AIDS?  Don't you worry?

GLORIA

You worry too much.

FAITH

(sultry)

Why worry about something that can kill you

in ten years when there are so many things

that can kill you today?

GLORIA

How can we make you happy?

YURI

By leaving.

YURI

(providing a commentary)

--that's the Beretta, comes with a 36

cartridge, easy-operating clip--

YURI (cont'd)

(shocked)

Jesus, why did you do that?

BAPTISTE

What did you say?

YURI

(feigning anger, gesturing at the

gun)

Now you're going to have to buy it.

(grabbing the gun from Baptiste)

It's a used gun.  I can't sell a used gun.

BAPTISTE

A used gun.  That's a good one.

BAPTISTE (cant'd)

(confiding in Yuri)

There's no discipline with the young boys.

I try to set an example but it's difficult.

I blame the MTV.

BAPTISTE (cont'd)

Let me show you something.

YURI (V.O.)

I had heard of the "Boy Brigades", "Small

Boy Units", "Kalashnikov Kids".  The theory

was that a bullet coming from a fourteen

year old is just as effective as one trom a

forty year old.

BAPTISTE

I can't pay your asking price, Yuri.  We are

not a rich people and the market is already

flooded with your Kalashnikovs.  In some

places you can buy one for the price of a

chicken.

YURI

You can't just look at the unit price.  You

forget the ancillary costs.  End user

certificates need to be forged and

notarized, shell companies set up, insurance

purchased, pilots and crews hired.  Not to

mention the bribes.  You can't get a nut

and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a

bribe.  There's one bribe for the nut.

Another for the bolt.  This is an expensive

proposition.

BAPTISTE

I pay in timber...or stones.

YURI

(regarding the stones)

I'll take the stones.  It's hard to get a

tree trunk in my hand luggage.

BAPTISTE

(referring to the inspection)

Very professional, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT

(dismissing the troops)

Dismissed!

YURI

I know you're planning a new offensive.  If

you delay a week I can get you the armored

personnel carriers we talked about.  They

would give you a significant strategic

advantage.

BAPTISTE

They say I am the lord of war.  But perhaps

it is you.

YURI

(correcting him)

It's not "lord of war".  It's "warlord".

BAPTISTE

I like it my way.

YURI (V.O.)

Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-

dollar bills.  You can get a million dollars

into a cigarette box.

YURI (V.O.)

By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up

to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed

the lies.

AVA

Yuri, I just got off the phone with the

dealer.  I sold my first painting.

YURI

(feigning surprise)

Fantastic.  Who bought it?

AVA

Someone important.  They want to remain

anonymous.

(asking in a way that does not

expect an answer)

How was your trip?

YURI

You know.  Same old, same old.

(quickly changing the subject)

Where's Nicki, in bed?

AVA

I'm sorry.  Poor darling.  He tried to stay

up.

YURI

I'll kiss him goodnight.

VITALY

(opening champagne)

This calls for a drink.

YURI

What doesn't?

AVA

(still giddy at the news)

My first painting.  I'm officially an

artist!

YURI (V.O.)

I figured I was a patron of the arts and of

everything else Ava had tried and failed at

after modelling.  Acting, her own cosmetics

line.  I didn't sabotage her careers but I

can't deny it was convenient for me in

maintaining a low profile.  She was a

beautiful bird in a gilded cage.

YURI

How are you, brother?

VITALY

(shrug)

You know, still the resident family fuck-up.

YURI

Someone has to do it.

VITALY

She knows, right?

YURI

We don't talk about it.

YURI (cont'd)

(shrug)

How many car salesmen talk about their work,

how many executives at cigarette companies?

And both of their products kill more people

every year than mine.  At least mine has a

safety switch.  If those guys can leave

their work at the office, why can't I?

VITALY

Shit, you're good.  You almost had me

convinced.

(to his girlfriend, knocking back

his drink)

We're going, baby.

YURI

(raising his glass for a toast)

To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova.

AVA

(gasp)

Yuri!

YURI

(shrug)

The trip went better than expected.

AVA

(fishing out the damp baubles)

Yuri, they're beautiful.

(flirtacious grin)

But what am I going to wear them with?

YURI

(flirting back)

I know just the outfit.

YURI (V.O.)

I didn't know how much she knew and how much

she ignored.  I was a good provider and as

far as she was concerned - loyal.  Despite

the other women, I always made love to Ava

as if she was the only one.

YURI

(to the DRIVER)

Take Park.

YURI

(to the Driver)

This is good.

YURI (cont'd)

(to the Driver from the sidewalk)

Take them on a tour of the Tri-State.

VALENTINE

Where in God's name is he going?  Is he

lost?

AVA

(into phone)

Vitaly...it's Ava.

Sierra Leone - 1999

YURI (V.O.)

I was now the best merchant of death alive.  I

didn't own my own plane.  I owned a fleet -

running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the

Ivory Coast at least once a week.

Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were

also starting to find West Africa on the map.

Most trips I had phoney paperwork.  If the

deadline was tight, I had no paperwork at all.

PILOT

(to his co-pilot)

--Even taking into consideration the pay-off

to the parents, a week with a girl in

Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a

girl in Jersey.

CO-PILOT

Plus, they're cleaner--

PILOT

--and a lot of them speak better English.

CO-PILOT

(shrug)

Personally, I prefer a language barrier--

VALENTINE (O.C.)

--Charlie, Echo, India.  Descend for landing

on heading zero...two...nine.

YURI

(into phone, trying not to sound

too desperate)

Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.  Sorry to call

you on this number but I've got an Interpol

jet and--

COL. SOUTHERN

(into phone, measured voice)

I can't know you right now.  It's not a good

time.

YURI

(gaping at the phone in disbelief)

Not a good time!

CO-PILOT

Motherfucker!

VALENTINE

(radio)

--Charlie, Echo, India.  Comply immediately.

That was your last warning.

YURI

Where was the first fucking warning?!

VALENTINE

(radio)

Rock your wings if you intend to comply.

PILOT

(to Yuri, anxious)

I'm putting us down.

YURI

(incredulous)

You land and we're all going away!  I don't

have paperwork!

PILOT

(incredulous)

We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're

firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about

going away!  They shoot again, we're going

away for good!  I'm putting us down.

YURI

(knowing he's right)

Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!!

PILOT

(into radio)

This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending

on heading zero two nine.

YURI

(pointing out a narrow highway)

Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's

our only fucking hope.

PILOT

(concerned)

A pothole could set us off.

YURI

Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the

best, Tony.

INTERPOL PILOT

I can't land there.

VALENTINE

(to the pilot)

He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on

the tarmac.

YURI

(to the pilots, sizing up the

locals)

We're going to be okay.

YURI (cont'd)

(calling out from the window)

Where are you going?

PILOT

As far from the evidence as I can.

YURI

Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be

any evidence!  Stay with the plane!

YURI

(to the gathering locals)

Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge.

YURI (cont'd)

(to other locals)

Take the whole crate.

YURI

(muttering under his breath,

shutting off the calculator in

disgust)

What a fucking disaster.

YURI

Hey, not those!  You don't touch the plane!

(plaintive moan)

Not the fucking seats...

VALENTINE

Hey, you!

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(exasperated)

Forget it.

MBIZI

You run from us.

(flashing a machete in Yuri's

face)

Can you run with no legs?

VALENTINE

No, Mbizi.  No, no, no.

MBIZI

Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.  He is

a devil.  Let me disappear him.

VALENTINE

I can't do that.

MBIZI

Look where we are.  Who will know?

VALENTINE

We will.

MBIZI

Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.  I will go to

hell to stop him.

VALENTINE

(gently)

No.

(to his Agents)

Find the pilots.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

I've spent my whole career on the right side

of the line.  You're the first man I've

encountered who makes me seriously consider

crossing it.

YURI

What's the charge?

VALENTINE

What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

YURI

I'm on safari.

VALENTINE

(referring to the bullet)

Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?

YURI

Are you with the park service?  Hunting

without a license - is that the charge?

VALENTINE

You're trafficking arms.

YURI

Trading.  But without evidence who can say?

VALENTINE

Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by

keeping the poorest people on the planet

killing each other.

(hesitates, unsure whether to

waste his breath - wastes it

anyway)

Do you know why I do what I do?

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(ignoring him)

There are more prestigious assignments, you

know.  Keeping track of the nuclear

arsenals.  You would think it more critical

to world security.  It's not.  Nine out of

ten war victims today are killed by assault

rifles and other small arms - like yours.

Those missiles just sit in their silos.

Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass

destruction.

YURI

I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

I admit, a shooting war is better for

business.  But I'd prefer people to fire my

guns and miss.  Just as long as they're

firing.

YURI (cont'd)

I realize the unspeakable things that are

done with my weapons.  I also understand the

unspeakable things that are done with

Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson

baseball bats and they aren't taking those

off the market any time soon.  People will

always buy guns.  Why not mine?

YURI (cont'd)

Can I go?  You've got nothing on me--

(unable to resist)

--but cuffs.

VALENTINE

I am legally permitted to hold you for

twenty-four hours without charging you.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

You may ask, why do I bother to do that?  I

can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your

company.  And you may be surprised to learn

that it is not for any vindictive motive.  No.

The reason I delay you for every second of the

permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am

delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of

your victims.  I don't think of it as taking a

day from you but giving a day to them.  Some

innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one

more day on this earth because you are not

free.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five

minutes.

VALENTINE

You'll be pleased to know your colleagues

were no more co-operative than you.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

The locals got to them before we could.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

Handsome family.

VIVIAN

(pleasantly surprised)

Yuri!  Yuri Orlov!

YURI

(giving her an embarrassed hug)

Vivian...

VIVIAN

What are you doing here?

YURI

(approaching the window)

You know.  Fighting the good fight.

VIVIAN

An aid program?

YURI

Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some

transport problems.  You couldn't give me a

ride to Monrovia, could you?

VIVIAN

Sure.  Climb in.

VIVIAN (cant' d)

We're pulling out.  It's too dangerous.

It's a shame.  We were really doing some

good things.

YURI

Jesus!  Simeon!

YURI (cont'd)

Andre!  What in heaven is he doing here?

ANDRE JNR.

A gift for you.

ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)

You got here just in time.  I was afraid he

would die before you got a chance to kill

him.

YURI

Me?!

ANDRE JNR.

Who do you think informed on you - cost you your

plane?  He came to meet my father, hoping to take

your place.

YURI

You stupid old fuck!

ANDRE JNR.

(knowing smile)

He killed your man when he tried to kill

you.

YURI

No.

ANDRE JNR.

(confused)

You want us to let him go?

YURI

No.  No.  I...

ANDRE JNR.

So you do want him dead.  You just don't

want to kill him yourself?  I understand.

ANDRE JNR.

We'll do it together.  A bonding experience.

ANDRE JNR.

You can stop if you want - but

you do.  Just say the word.

ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)

Say, "stop".

YURI

(quietly)

Stop.

ANDRE JNR.

(surveying the blood-spattered

room)

I'll get you another room with a nicer view.

YURI (V.O.)

I started doing a lot of cocaine in West

Africa.  I wasn't medicating myself.  I was

simply playing catch-up.  I was constantly

dealing with people who are chemically

imbalanced without the aid of chemicals.

It's just a matter of etiquette.  It's rude

to act sane in a room full of lunatics.

BARMAN

He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.

YURI

(wiping his nose)

What?

BARMAN

"Brown-brown".

YURI

What is it?

BARMAN

(laughs)

A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.

YURI

What does the gunpowder do?

BARMAN

It's magic.  They give it to the small boys

before battle - they do anything.

YURI

Some other time.

BARMAN

You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.

YURI

Why?

BARMAN

(laughing)

Because it's your gunpowder.

YURI

(to no one in particular, whipping his

vodka bottle off the bar)

I'm going for a walk.

YURI

(a mixture of French and English)

I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you?

PROSTITUTE

(in French, as she counts Yuri's

money)

It's not what I would call a fuck.

YURI

Are you sick?

YURI (cont'd)

(screaming)

Are you sick?!

GIRL #1 (O.C.)

They will!

GIRL #2 (O.C.)

They won't!

GIRL #1 (O.C.)

They will!

GIRL #2 (O.C.)

They won't!

GIRL #1

They will!

GIRL #2

Ask the foreigner.  The foreigner will know.

YURI

Hello.

GIRL #1

Sir, will my fingers grow back?

YURI

Simeon.

YURI (cont'd)

Simeon!!

MAN #1

Don't.  He's Andre's.

MAN #2

(keeping his gun raised)

Fuck Andre.

YURI

(seemingly beyond caring)

Yeah, fuck Andre.

YURI

(referring to the gun)

I'm sorry.  They don't usually do that.  Let

me have a look.  Maybe I can fix it.

MAN #1

(disgusted)

Fuck off!

DISSOLVE TO:

ANDRE BAPTISTE

Yuri, you fucked up!  I am going to shoot

your face off with your own gun.

YURI

(unfazed, regarding the man)

Not bad.  Andre's latest double?

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(to Yuri, standing beside his

uncanny double)

How did you know?

YURI

He's too eloquent.

ANDRE BAPTISTE

You have no heart.

ANDRE BAPTISTE

Have you seen the news?  They accuse me of

rigging elections, but after this in your

Florida with your Supreme Court of

kangaroos--

ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)

--now the U.S. must shut up forever.

YURI

More good news.  That's the last aid

shipment.  The war is so bad, the U.N. is

pulling out.

ANDRE BAPTISTE

Why is nothing happening?

ANDRE, JNR.

(reluctant to give his father bad

news)

No trucks.  They are trapped on the front

lines.

YURI

There are trucks.  You just have to get all

that food out of them.

ANDRE JNR.

Killing certain humans can be considered

humanitarian.

(thinly disguised reference to the

previous night)

Isn't that right, Mr. Yuri?

YURI (V.O.)

After surviving the last few days I'd started

to feel like I was invincible.  But there was

a weapon that could hurt me.

AVA

Hush, Nicki.

(to Valentine)

I don't believe you.

AVA (cont'd)

Can you prove any of it?  Where is your

evidence?

VALENTINE

I was hoping you could help us with that.

(opens an old file containing a

copy of a newspaper clipping,

headlined, "Cordova

Disappearance" )

I understand your parents died tragically in

EI Salvador.

(meeting Avars gaze)

That regime has startling similarities to

several of the regimes supplied by your

husband.

AVA

Get out.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES

And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's

evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.

YURI (O.C.)

Ava?

YURI

Ava, what's wrong?  Where's Nicki?

AVA

(still with her back to us)

He's with your parents.

YURI

Why aren't you dressed?  I thought we were

going out.

AVA

(turning back to look at him)

I can't wear the clothes.  I can't wear the

jewelry.  I can't drive the car.  I can't

live in this house.  Everything1s got blood

on it.

YURI

Don't be so melodramatic.

AVA

Of course I'm melodramatic.  I'm a failed actress,

remember?  We need to talk about it.

YURI

Why?  We never have before.

AVA

Now we do.

YURI

These people - you can't trust them--

AVA

--I've talked to your parents.  Why do you

think they don't want your money?  They know

where it comes from.  We all know.

YURI

I sell people a means to defend themselves,

Ava.  That's all.  I don't hold a gun to any

one's head and make them shoot--

AVA

--Yuri, I see the news.  Sierra Leone--

YURI

--I don't sell machetes.

AVA

--What do you think is pointing at the

victims when they use those machetes?  I see

the pictures.  Yuri, the guns are bigger

than the boys.

YURI

(angered)

There's nothing illegal about what I do.

AVA

I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong.

AVA (cont' d)

I can accept the drugs.  I can even accept

the other women.  I can't accept this.

AVA

Please stop.

YURI

(looks back)

It makes no difference if I stop.  Someone

will take my place the next day.

AVA

Let them.  We have enough.  You're not that

little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for

a loaf of bread--

YURI

--It's not about the money.

AVA

What is it?

AVA (cont'd)

I feel like all I've done my whole life is

be pretty.  All I've done is be born.  I'm

not just a failed actress.  I'm also a

failed writer, failed artist, failed

businesswoman.  I'm not much good as a

mother.  Come to think of it, I'm not even

that pretty any more.  I've failed at

everything, Yuri.

(turning back to him)

But I won't fail as a human being.  I'm

leaving.

YURI

You can't leave.  I'll stop.

(as if trying to convince himself)

I'll stop.

YURI (cont'd)

I've been thinking about it for a while.  A

lot, lately.

(as if trying to convince himself)

I'm making more from the oil and timber

anyhow.

(further reassurance)

I'll stop.

AVA

(pleading eyes)

You will?  You promise?

YURI

(deadly serious)

Yes.

(changing the subject a

millisecond too fast)

Now get dressed.  We'll go out.

YURI (cont'd)

By the way, you're wrong about not being

pretty any more.

YURI (V.O.)

For the next month I stopped running guns.

I went legitimate.

YURI (V.O.)

No wonder Valentine was confused.

YURI (V.O.)

Thank God there are still legal ways to

exploit developing countries.

YURI (V.O.)

But the only problem with an honest buck is

they're so hard to make.  The margins are

too low.  Too many people are doing it.

YURI

(into phone)

--Impossible.  Two and a quarter?  I can't

make a profit at two and a quarter.  Why

don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay

you?

AVA

(confused)

Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the

lobby.

YURI

(glance to his watch)

He's early.

ANDRE JNR.

(to the girls)

--You should come to Liberia with me

tomorrow.  It is beautiful this time of

year.

TEENAGE GIRL

Liberia.  Is that on Long Island?

ANDRE JNR.

Yuri!

YURI

(nervous as hell)

What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(hugging Yuri)

We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.

YURI

(pulling him out of earshot of the

curious Doorman, anxious whisper)

So at the same time you thought you'd drop

in on your arms dealer?!

ANDRE BAPTISTE

Is that what you still are?  You're a hard

man to get hold of all of a sudden.

YURI

I--

ANDRE BAPTISTE

--But now you mention it, we are doing a

little shopping while we're here - that is

if you open for business.

YURI

(anxious look past Andre to the motorcade

on the street)

They've got to be watching.

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(disdainful shrug)

Of course they blame me.  They always blame

me.  They are on a--

YURI

(unable to resist)

--hunt for a witch?

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(a smile, for once correcting

Yuri)

"Witch-hunt".  But I have been granted

diplomatic immunity due to the escalation

in hostilities.

(conspiratorial)

That is why I need you.  They are making

life difficult to re-supply.  It will

require a man of your unusual ingenuity.

YURI

I can't help you.  I'm sorry.

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(nods)

I understand.

ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)

But you should know that our present

difficulties compel us to be unusually

generous.

ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)

(hugging Yuri)

Farewell, Lord of War.

ANDRE JNR.

You still haven't brought me the gun of

Rambo.

AVA

(looking up from the book)

Was that about the oil or the timber?

YURI

Both.  Everything.

YURI (V.O.)

At four and a half months a human fetus has

a reptile's tail - a remnant of our

evolution.

YURI (V.O.)

You can fight a lot of enemies and survive

but if you fight your biology you always

lose.

YURI

Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?  I'm

leaving in ten minutes.

AVA

Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

NICOLAI

Bye, Papa.

YURI

(hugging him)

See you, big guy.

AVA

(teasing him)

Personally, I'm glad you're going.  You've

been here so long you're starting to get on

my nerves.

YURI

(taking the teasing good-

naturedly)

This oil concession should be wrapped up by

Thursday.  I'll be back for the weekend.

We'll go somewhere - the sea.

AVA

That would be fun.

YURI

You trust me, right?

YURI (V.O.)

She looked me directly in the eye the way

I've looked in the eyes of a thousand

customs officials, government bureaucrats

and footsoldiers from every law enforcement

agency in the world - and she lied without

flinching.

AVA

Yes, I trust you.

YURI (V.O.)

She'd learned from the best.

AVA (O.C.)

(to the DRIVER)

That's him.

NICOLAI

(confused)

Where are we going, Mama?

AVA

It's a game.

NICOLAI

Like hide and seek?

AVA

Yes.

YURI (V.O.)

I can always sense when I'm being tailed.  I

know what to look for.  But then I'd never

been tailed by the woman I love.

YURI (V.O.)

I can put myself in Ava's place.  She might

have understood if the combination was the

last four digits of my social, my birthdate,

even her birthdate but not Nicolai's.

YURI (V.O.)

My son's birthday unlocked what the government

would later describe as, "a catalogue of

carnage".

AVA

(whisper, to herself)

Not that.  Not that, Yuri.

VITALY

Come to see how the other half lives?

YURI

I miss your borscht.  Mom and Dad say you're

clean.

VITALY

You too.  They said you went legitimate -

hard to believe.

YURI

That's because it's not true.

YURI

Only you know.  I'm leaving tonight - on a

job.  I want you to come.

VITALY

I can't.  I'm thinking of opening my own

place.

YURI

Maybe this trip will help.  It's good money.

VITALY

(looking to his parents)

I've given my word.

YURI

They don't have to know.  We'll tell them

we're going for a little "r" and "r".

VITALY

Why do you need me all of a sudden?

YURI

West Africa's fucked-up.

(off Vitaly's look)

More than usual.  I can't trust anybody.  I

need someone to watch my back.

YURI (cant'd)

"Brothers in arms".

Sierra Leone - 2000

YURI

(concerned by the route)

Where are we going?

ANDRE JNR.

RUF - "freedom fighters".

YURI (V.O.)

Every faction in Africa calls themselves by

these noble names - "liberation-this",

"patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of-

something or other".  I guess they can't own

up to what they usually are - "federation-

of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of-

oppressors".  Often the most barbaric

atrocities occur when both combatants

proclaim themselves "freedom fighters".

VITALY

Jesus.

VITALY

Yuri, I need to talk to you.

YURI

Not now.

VITALY

(insistent)

Now.

YURI

(to the Rebel Leader)

Excuse me.

YURI

(irritated by the interruption)

What?

VITALY

(anxious whisper)

We can't do this deal.

YURI

(incredulous)

The fuck we can't.

VITALY

(referring to the camp)

Look over there.  As soon as we leave,

they're going to die.

YURI

(averting his eyes from the camp)

It's not our business.

VITALY

(protesting)

They killed a boy just now - as young as

Nicki.

REBEL LEADER

What's the hold up?

YURI

(trying to keep his poise)

There is no hold up.  I'll be right there.

YURI (cont'd)

Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't

control what they do.

VITALY

Today we can.  They're right there - close

enough to touch.

YURI

(angry, impatient)

What do you think they'll do if we back out

- they'll kill us.

VITALY

And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.

REBEL LEADER

What is he saying?

YURI

Nothing.

VITALY

(resigned)

Nothing.  You're right, Yuri.  You're right.

(getting his head back in the

game)

Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault

rifles and 800 grenades?  I thought it was

1,200 grenades.  I'd better check.

ANDRE JNR.

What are you doing?

VITALY

Something for Yuri.

ANDRE JNR.

Step away - slowly.

YURI

Vit!!

YURI (cont'd)

No!!

YURI (V.O.)

Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of

gunrunning.  Never pick up a gun and join

the customers.

YURI (V.O.)

Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone.

Demand is so high.  Fortunately, we had a lot

of boxes just the right size.

YURI (V.O.)

I don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or

Catholic guilt.  My parents were like God's

tag-team.

YURI (V.O.)

But I could not deny them the chance to say

goodbye to their eldest son.

YURI (V.O.)

For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the

lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death

certificate.  I should have paid more.

YURI (V.O.)

I've smuggled millions of rounds of

ammunition and the bullet that lands me in

jail is found under my dead brother's rib.

AGENT

(flashing some ID)

Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

YURI

(resigned smile, regarding the

insignia on their jackets)

Believe it or not, I only use the first two.

AGENT

You have the right to remain silent.  Use

it.

ANATOLY

"Crimean Restaurant".

YURI (O.C.)

Papa?

IRINA

(into phone)

Both my sons are dead.

VALENTINE

One of yours?

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(referring to a document)

Curiously, the death certificate says he

died of heart failure.

YURI

(shrug)

Maybe he did.

(referring to the slug)

If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have

heart failure.

VALENTINE

We performed the autopsy and released your

brother's body to your family.  You tried

to do something decent, Yuri.  You went

against your nature.  And now it's cost you.

(unable to resist)

Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like

your funeral.

YURI

Falsifying a death certificate?  That's not

going to hold me.

VALENTINE

You're right, as usual.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(putting a copy of the New York

Times in front of Yuri)

Have you seen today's paper?

VALENTINE (cont'd)

(pacing, lauding it over Yuri)

Fake end-user certificates, cut-out

companies, all meticulously catalogued.

There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot

anywhere in the world you aren't on first

name terms with.

(producing another evidence bag

containing Ava's diamond earrings

and an engagement ring)

Your trophy wife gave us the prize.  She

also provided us with these - which we

suspect are conflict diamonds.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

She has agreed to testify against you.

YURI

Enjoy it.

VALENTINE

(confused)

What?

YURI

This.  Tell me that I am everything you

despise, that I am the personification of

evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown

of the social fabric of society and world

order, that I am a one man genocide.  Say

everything you want to say to me now -

because you don't have long.

VALENTINE

Are you not paying attention or are you

delusional?  You've broken every arms

embargo written.  There's enough in those

briefcases to buy you consecutive life

sentences.  You'll spend ten years going

from a cell to a courtroom before you even

start doing your time.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

You don't seem to fully appreciate the

seriousness of your situation!

YURI

(snapping back - his emotion

finally showing)

My family has disowned me.  My wife and son

have left me.  My brother is dead.  Trust

me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my

situation.  But I promise you I won't spend

a single second in a courtroom.

VALENTINE

You are delusional.

YURI

I like you, Jack.  Well, maybe not.  But I

understand you.  You feel your loyalty to

your badge has finally been rewarded.  But

you haven't counted on the people who gave

you that badge.

YURI (cont'd)

(meeting Valentine's gaze)

Let me tell you what's going to happen so

you can prepare yourself.

YURI (cont'd)

Soon there's going to be a knock on that

door and you're going to be called outside.

YURI (O.C.)

In the hall there will be a man who

outranks you.

YURI (O.C.)

First, he will compliment you on the fine

job you've done, how you're making the world

a safer place and then he is going to tell

you that I am to be released.

YURI (O.C.)

You are going to protest, you will probably

threaten to resign.

YURI (O.C.)

But in the end I will be released.

YURI

(glancing to the open newspaper)

The reason I'll be released is the same

reason you think I will be convicted.  I do

rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic

men calling themselves leaders today.

(referring to the newspaper)

But some of those men are the enemies of

your enemies.

YURI (cont'd)

And while the biggest arms dealer in the world

is your boss, the President of the United

States - who ships more merchandise in a day

than I do in a year - sometimes it's

embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the

guns.  Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

to supply opposition forces he can't be seen

supplying.  You call me evil, but,

unfortunately for you, I am a necessary evil.

VALENTINE

I would tell you to go to hell.  But I think

you're already there.

YURI

What if I'm not?  What if I sleep fine at

night?  What if I sleep better than you? I

think that's what truly scares you.

YURI (V.O.)

Most people are happy just to get out of

jail.  I expect to be paid to leave.

YURI (V.O.)

I'm not a fool.  I know that just because they

need me one day doesn't mean they won't make

me a scapegoat the next.  But I was back doing

what I do best.

BORDER OFFICER

(skeptical)

Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?

YURI

Sun umbrellas.

BORDER OFFICER

Have a safe trip.

YURI

For someone who's never fired a gun or been

in a battle, I have suffered many

casualties in my life.  I guess that's how I

survived.  I never went to war...

YURI (cont'd)

...especially with myself.
