preaching.

black man has to do is respect himself. Respect

his body and his mind. Quit taking the white

man's poison into your body: his cigarettes,

his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his

pork.

God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.

MALCOLM

What? Everybody knows God is White.

BEMBRY (contd)

But everything the white man taught you, you

learned. He told you you were a black heathen

and you believed him. He told you how he took

you out of darkness and brought you to the

light. And you believed him. He taught you to

worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin

-- and you believed him. He told you black was

a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look

up the word black in the dictionary?

That's bullshit. That's a white man's book.

Ain't all these white man's books?

BEMBRY

They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark

deep and black I could scarcely look at him. I

knew I was not dreaming. He was there.

ELIJAH

I tell you that the most dangerous creation of

any society in the world is the man with

nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men

to change the world. One will do. The Earth

belongs to us, the Black man and whatever is

around it, and on it and in it. Praises are

due to him forever for bringing to us again,

our self and our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN,

My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a

pimp and the world is still full of temptation.

When God bragged how faithful Job was, the

devil argued that only God's protective hedge

around him kept him pure, the devil said remove

the hedge and he will curse his maker.

Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I

believe you will remain faithful.

Earl. He just joined the Nation.

We can always use another good brother.

EARL

I'm a willing servant for Allah.

129A 	EXT. CHURCH - DAY

MALCOLM

You think you are Christians, and yet you see

your so-called white Christian brother hanging

black Christians on trees. You say that white

man loves you and yet he has done every evil

act against you. He has everything while he is

living and tells you to be a good slave and

when you die you will have more than he has in

Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in

pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to

a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed

Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on

earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.

The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity.

MALCOLM (contd)

My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will

sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's

pie in the sky.

MALCOLM'S VOICE

Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down

on his knees begging the Lord to give him in

heaven what the white devil enjoys right here

on earth?

SPEAKER

rent control and for community control of our

SECOND SPEAKER

If the man behind the counter ain't black,

don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think

black. Buy black.

MALCOLM

Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because,

mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead.

And we are here to resurrect the black man

back from the dead.

they're devils.

MALCOLM (contd)

And you are putting yourselves on the auction

block, letting them examine you like a horse,

teaches that you are black and should be

proud...

MALCOLM

We're not American, we're Africans who happen

Plymouth Rock landed on us.

MALCOLM

Put an end to your begging. No more "Please,

Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another

Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.

MALCOLM

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should

SHORTY

Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How

MALCOLM

I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.

SHORTY

You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I

You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of

Harlem. When I think how close we came to

gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

ARCHIE

I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my

rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but

did you have that number? Tell me.

MALCOLM

I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is

we got to get you back on your feet.

down or messed up by women.

CUT BACK TO:

138B 	BETTY AND MALCOLM

MALCOLM

Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to

talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a

gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the

strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by

the woman who slept in his arms.

BETTY

Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose

marriage?

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not

practice celibacy. If a woman is the right

height for a man, the right complexion, if her

age is half the man's plus seven, if she

understands that man's essential nature is

strong and woman's weak, if she loves children,

can cook, sew and stay out of trouble--

BETTY

I think you've made your points, Brother

Malcolm.

MALCOLM

What points?

BETTY

That you haven't time for either marriage or

eating--

talk a lot.

BETTY

If you'll start eating, there is a question I

have. Go ahead. Start.

You have enough worries of your own.

MALCOLM

No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one.

Tell me something: how tall are you?

BETTY

Why do you ask?

MALCOLM

Just an idle question.

BETTY

If it's just idle, I won't answer it.

BETTY (contd)

But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a

tall man.

No, each of us must relearn that work is the

only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a

great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting

that we are nothing, while He is all.

Allah Akbar.

ELIJAH

Tonight I shall introduce you as my National

Representative. It will be a difficult task.

Your assignment is to build temples all over

this nation. More work than you have ever done

in your life and you will be in the public eye.

My son, beware of those cameras, they are just

as bad as a narcotic.

ELIJAH (contd)

Yes, the white devil will watch your every

step. Even your own Brothers will become

jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you

a parable -- regarding your work.

ELIJAH (contd)

Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If

you offer it to the people and they have no

choice, they must drink out of it. But if you

present them with this glass--

ELIJAH (contd)

--and let them make their decision, they will

choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only

religion which addresses the needs and problems

of the so-called Negro, especially in the

ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs,

crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol,

gambling, fornication and adultery.

VOICE OF MALCOLM X

This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from

his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense

of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to

worship and to fear. He was the first man I

ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of

a gun but the fear one has of the power of the

sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost

MALCOLM (contd)

Before there were any such things as Democrats

which we have been forced to live... the black

masses who are tired of listening to the

promises of white politicians to correct the

miserable living conditions that exist in our

community... the black masses that are sick of

the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced

by these semi-savage white policemen that

patrol our community, like the occupation

forces of a conquering enemy army... the black

masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle

Tom leadership set up by the white man to act

as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US

SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING!

MALCOLM/HIS VOICE

The white people who are guilty of white

supremacy try and hide their own guilt by

accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of

teaching black supremacy when he tries to

uplift the mentality, the social, and economic

condition of black people in this country. And

the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting

the black people economically, civilly, and

otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the

Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic

simply because he teaches our people to go into

business for ourselves and trying to take over

the economic leadership in our own community.

The black people in this country have been the

victims of violence at the hands of the white

man for 400 years, and following the ignorant

Negro preachers, we have thought that it was

God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute

that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they

use to put on a white sheet and use a

bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken

off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've

traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And

just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to

keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds

or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them

to love their enemy or pray for those who use

them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah

Muhammad is showing black people that just as

the white man and every other person on this

earth has God given rights, natural rights,

civil rights, and any other kind of rights that

you can think of when it comes to defending

himself.

MODERATOR

Mr. X, before we start our discussion tonight

-- The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers -- would you

mind explaining for us the meaning of your

name, which is the letter X.

MALCOLM

Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the

slavemasters named most of the so-called

Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah

Muhammad teaches us once you come into the

knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name

with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut

off from our Eastern culture for so long that

we don't know the names we originally had, we

will use X until we get back to the East.

MODERATOR

Thank you. Now Dr. Payson.

DR. PAYSON

Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so

he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good

law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you

a question?

MALCOLM

Please, go ahead.

DR. PAYSON

Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black

supremacy? Why do you teach hate?

MALCOLM

For the white man to ask the black man if he

hates him is just like the rapist asking the

raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you

hate me!" The white man is in no moral position

to accuse anyone of hate.

MODERATOR

Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been

progress.

MALCOLM

I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let

me finish with my brother.

MALCOLM (contd)

Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community."

I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."

DR. PAYSON

You put it very well.

MALCOLM

You left one phrase out. Another educated

Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother

Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices

of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?

DR. PAYSON

Entirely.

MALCOLM

Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a

Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is

called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's

called a nigger.

MALCOLM (contd)

And I'm not finished. To understand this man--

MALCOLM (contd)

--you must know that historically there are two

kinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field

Negroes. The house Negro lived in the big

house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty

good and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved

him more than the master loved himself. If the

master's house caught fire, he'd be the first

to put the blaze out. If the master got sick,

he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick?"

WE sick! If someone said to him, "Let's run

away and escape. Let's separate." He'd say,

"Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I

got here?" That was the House Negro. In those

days he was called the House Nigger. Well,

that's what we call them today because we still

got a lot of House Niggers running around.

Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?

DR. PAYSON

Let him finish.

MALCOLM

Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught

hell all day long. He was beaten by the master;

he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and

hated his master. If the house caught fire,

he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick,

he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to

him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell,

"Yeah, man, any place is better than this."

You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America

today. I'm one.

BROTHER BENJAMIN

Tell it.

MALCOLM

--there's another one. The majority of black

Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't

talk about OUR progress, about OUR government,

OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't

even let you near the plant.

BEMBRY

Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your

true servant and the brothers asked me to tell

you Malcolm is getting too much press. The

brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of

Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the

Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he

is. You lifted him out of the darkness.

ELIJAH

Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister

is doing, has done, has been of great benefit

to the Nation.

BEMBRY

Great benefit for himself.

white people like myself, who are not

prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help

the cause?

MALCOLM

Nothing!

MALCOLM'S VOICE

--you can see my burglary hangout. I lived

like an animal. Had it not been for the

Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in

an insane asylum or dead.

MALCOLM

Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side,

so God will be on our side to help us fight our

battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop

being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and

committing adultery. When we get off the

welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need

for your family, then your family respects you.

They'll be proud to say "That's my father."

She's proud to say "That's my husband..."

Father means you're taking care of those

children. Just 'cause you made them that don't

mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby,

but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can

go and get a woman but anybody can't take care

of a woman. This is the type of teaching that

the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we

can build the moral fiber of our people.

MALCOLM

I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the

FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz

if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd

write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.

162	INT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT

MALCOLM

We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in

Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100

temples in fifty states. From a handful we

have grown to scores of thousands.

MALCOLM/HIS VOICE

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that

God is now about to establish a kingdom on this

earth based on brotherhood and

[...]

against peace, his history on this earth has

proved that. Nowhere in history has he been

brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has

been brotherly toward you is when he can use

you, when he can exploit you, when he can

oppress you, when you will submit to him. And

since his own history makes him unqualified to

be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of

brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

teaches us that God is about to eliminate that

particular race from this earth. So since they

are due for elimination, we don't want to be

with them.

MALCOLM (contd)

If the so-called Negro were American citizens

we wouldn't have a race problem. If the

Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you

wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th,

14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution

was authentic, you wouldn't have a race

problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation

decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a

race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These

Negro leaders have been telling the white man

everything is all right, everything is under

control. And they've been telling the white man

that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to

him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been

saying is going to come to pass is now coming

to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing

up saying that we are about to have a racial

explosion. We're going to have a racial

explosion and that's more dangerous than an

atomic explosion.

MALCOLM (contd)

It's going to explode because black people are

dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only

with the white man, but with these Negroes who

have been sitting around here posing as leaders

and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put

too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing

is going to explode and if the thing that

explodes is still inside the house, then the

house will be destroyed. So the Honorable

Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get

this powder keg out of your house, let the

black people in this country separate from him

while there's still time. And if the black man

is allowed to separate and go on onto some land

of his own, where he can solve his problems,

then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE

SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK

AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY!!!

BETTY

We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But

we're going to have one right now if you don't

talk about it.

MALCOLM

Talk about what?

BETTY

The talk is everywhere!

MALCOLM

There's always talk, always been talk, and

always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm

trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting

rich off the Nation?

BETTY

We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just

talk any more.

BETTY (contd)

"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old

leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today

faced paternity suits from two former

secretaries who charged he fathered their four

children..."

MALCOLM

reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're

trying to bring us down, bring down the

Messenger.

BETTY

"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had

had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since

1957..."

MALCOLM

I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.

BETTY

To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?

MALCOLM

Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the

matter with you?

BETTY

No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are

you so dedicated that you have blinded

yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face

the truth? Bembry is the editor of the

newspaper you established. Ask him why your

name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a

year? Ask him why you rate front page in every

paper in the country, but not a single sentence

in your own.

MALCOLM

(rationalizing)

I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our

people know what I'm doing.

BETTY

Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so

blind, everyone can see this but you!!!

MALCOLM

Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah

Muhammad saved my life.

BETTY

A long time ago. You've repaid them many times

over. Ask them why they have new cars and

houses full of new furniture.

MALCOLM

Is that what this is about? Material wealth?

BETTY

What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy

and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own

our own home. What about our children? What

about me? You don't even own life insurance.

MALCOLM

The Nation will provide for you and the

children if anything happens to me.

BETTY

Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are

you blind?

BETTY (contd)

Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising

our kids practically by myself, while you're

running all over the world. You don't know how

many times the girls ask me when is daddy

coming home?

MALCOLM

What do you want me to do? Our people need me.

BETTY

We need you too!

MALCOLM

What do you want me to do?

BETTY

Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a

day; but the possibility of betrayal never

enters your mind. If you won't do that for

yourself do it for us.

173 	INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY

MALCOLM

Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive

year on the racial front, and because I myself

intend to be very active in every phase of the

American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I

have called this press conference, this

morning in order to clarify my own position in

the struggle -- especially in regards to

politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought

the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable

Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on

I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts.

Internal differences within the Nation of Islam

forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own

free will. But now that it has happened, I

intend to make the most of it. Now that I have

more independence of action, I intend to use a

more flexible approach toward working with

others to get a solution to this problem. I do

not pretend to be a divine man, but I do

believe in divine guidance, divine power, and

in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not

educated, nor am I an expert in any particular

field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my

credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro

leaders or organizations. We must find a common

solution, to a common problem. I am going to

organize and head a new mosque in New York

City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This

gives us a religious base, and the spiritual

force necessary to rid our people of the vices

that destroy the moral fiber of our community.

Our political philosophy will be black

nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy

will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque,

Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and

financial aid from all quarters. Whites can

help us, but they can't join us. There can be

no black-white unity until there is first some

black unity.

MALCOLM (contd)

There is one further preparation I need. It is

a return to the source of our great religion. I

will make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life

that I stood before the Creator of all and felt

like a complete human being.

blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites.

And we are brothers, truly; people of all

colors and races believing in One God and one

humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth

came and blinded me. It has happened again...

179 	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT

MALCOLM'S VOICE

In the past, I have permitted myself to be used

to make sweeping indictments of all white

people, and these generalizations have caused

injuries to some white folks who did not

deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth

which I was blessed to undergo as a result of

my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no

longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of

one race. I intend to be careful not to

sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty.

I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of

the tenets of racism. In all honesty and

sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing

but freedom, justice and equality: life,

liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all

people.

MALCOLM

Let's begin.

REPORTER #1

Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you

sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.

MALCOLM

As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in

Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the

brotherhood that existed at all levels among

all people, all colors who had accepted the

religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it

had done, Islam, for those people despite their

complexion differences, that it would probably

do America well to study the religion of Islam

and perhaps it could drive some of the racism

from this society. Muslims look upon themselves

as human beings, as part of the human family

and therefore look upon all other segments of

the human family as part of that same family.

Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow

and white.

REPORTER #8

Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United

Nations at this point and ask that charges be

brought against the United States for its

treatment of the American Negroes?

MALCOLM

Oh yes.

MALCOLM (contd)

The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I

pointed out that during my trip that nations,

African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very

hypocritical when they stand up in the UN

condemning South Africa and saying nothing

about the racist practices that are manifested

everyday against Negroes in this society. I

would be not a man if I didn't do so. I

wouldn't be a man.

REPORTER #3

Are you prepared to work with some of the

leaders of some of the other civil rights

organizations?

MALCOLM

Certainly, we will work with any groups,

organizations or leaders in any way, as long as

it's genuinely designed to get results.

REPORTER #1

Does the new beard have any religious

significance?

MALCOLM

No, not particularly. But I do think that you

will And black people in America, as they

strive to throw off the shackles of mental

colonialism, will also probably reflect an

effort to throw off the shackles of cultural

colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect

desires of their own with standards of their

own.

REPORTER #2

One of your more controversial remarks was a

call for black people to get rifles and form

rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor

that for self-defense?

MALCOLM

I don't see why that should be controversial. I

think that if white people found themselves

victim of the same kind of brutality that black

people in this country face, and they saw that

the government was either unwilling or unable

to protect them, that the intelligence on the

part of the whites would make them get some

rifles and protect themselves.

REPORTER #2

What about the guns, Malcolm?

MALCOLM

Has the white man changed since I went away?

Have you put up your guns? The day you stop

being violent against my people will be the

day I tell folks to put away their guns.

I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.

BROTHER EARL

Let some of us come down there.

MALCOLM

No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.

BROTHER EARL

I wish you'd listen to us. What about the

meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.

MALCOLM

I don't want folks to be searched, it makes

people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among

my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect

me.

Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone.

MALCOLM

Betty it's me. It's me.

BETTY

Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us.

I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?

MALCOLM

Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's

all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.

BETTY

Dear heart, where are you?

MALCOLM

At the Hilton. The girls asleep?

BETTY

I just put them to bed. Can we come to the

meeting tomorrow?

MALCOLM

I don't think that's such a good idea.

197 	INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

Malcolm walks in. Present are Brothers Earl, Benjamin 2X and a

MALCOLM

Is the program ready?

BENJAMIN 2X

No, Brother Minister.

MALCOLM

Why not? You've had ample time, you and the

sister.

SISTER ROBIN

I apologize Brother Minister, we'll have it

next week.

MALCOLM

Folks are sitting out there _today_, not next

week, expecting to hear our program.

BENJAMIN 2X

Next week, Brother Minister.

MALCOLM

Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?

BROTHER EARL

Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said

he wouldn't be able to attend.

MALCOLM

So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I

informed last night?

BROTHER EARL

I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?

MALCOLM

Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my

business? Since when? She has nothing to do

with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody

else.

BROTHER EARL

I assumed...

MALCOLM

What did I tell you about assuming?

MALCOLM

Benjamin, you better go out there and explain

why the program isn't ready today.

MALCOLM

Sister, please go with the brother.

BROTHER EARL

Brother Minister, what is wrong?

MALCOLM

The way I feel, I ought not to go out there

today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this

tension by telling the black man not to fight

himself -- that's all a part of the white man's

big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst

ourselves, against each other. I'm not

fighting anyone, that's not what we're here

for.

BROTHER EARL

Let's cancel.

MALCOLM

Is my family here yet?

BROTHER EARL

Down front as always.

I wonder if anybody understands.

MALCOLM

Make it plain.

BENJAMIN 2X

And now, without further remarks, I present to

you one who is willing to put himself on the

line for you--

BENJAMIN 2X (contd)

--a man who would give his life for you. I want

you to hear, to listen, to understand one who

is a Trojan for the black man.

200B 	THE STUNNED FACES OF BLACK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE AUDUBON BALLROOM...

OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE

Here at this final hour, in this quiet place,

Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its

brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from

us forever.

200C 	DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor,

OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd)

For Harlem is where he worked, and where he

struggled and fought. His home of homes, where

his heart was and where his people are. And it

is therefore most fitting that we meet once

again in Harlem to share these last moments

with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to

those who loved her, have fought for her and

defended her honor even to death. It is not in

the memory of man that this beleaguered,

unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has

found a braver, more gallant young champion

than this Afro-American who lies before us

unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem

finds to honor in this stormy, controversial

and bold young captain and we will smile and we

will answer and say unto them:

2OOD  SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'S

OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd)

Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you

have him smile at you? Did you ever listen to

him? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he

ever associated with violence or any public

disturbance?

knew him, you would know why we must honor him.

200G	SHOT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE _REAL_ MALCOLM X

OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd)

Malcolm was our manhood, our living black

manhood. That was his meaning to his people and

in honoring him we honor the best in ourselves.

to be respected as a human being, in this

society, on this earth, in this day, which we

intend to bring into existence by any means

necessary."
