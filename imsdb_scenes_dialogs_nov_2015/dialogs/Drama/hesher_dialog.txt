TJ

This car has to go back.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER

Huh?

TJ

This car has to go back to where it

came from. Put it back on the truck.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER

What are you talking about, kid?

TJ

Stop unhooking it. There's been a

mistake.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER

I was told to bring it here. That's

what it says on my work order. Talk to

that guy if you've got a problem.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LARRY

(to tow truck driver)

Hey, Bill.

TJ

This car has to go back where it came

from.

LARRY

I beg your pardon?

TJ

It was brought here by mistake.

LARRY

And where was it supposed to go?

TJ

It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It

needs to go back where it came from.

The guy who sold it to you made a

mistake.

LARRY

(TO TONY)

What's the deal with this car again,

Tony?

TONY

Ah let's see, we bought this car

yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney-

TJ

That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell.

LARRY

Well, it's his name on the pink slip,

son. And that means it's his to sell

if he wants.

TJ

Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was

a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back

where it came from.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

LARRY

Thanks, Bill.

(TO TONY)

You got that work order there?

LARRY (CONT'D)

Get out of the car, son.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Dustin, get him outta there, will ya?

DUSTIN

Come on dude, get out of the car.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

C'mon. Open it.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Ow, fuck. What the fuck you doing?

Open it.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Put down the fuckin' window. I'm

serious.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

LARRY

I'd get out of here kid, before he

works himself loose.

GRANDMA

There's still plenty of applesauce

boys.

TJ

(TO DAD)

I don't get why what I think doesn't

matter.

DAD

It couldn't stay in the front of the

house anymore, TJ. I'm not having this

conversation again.

TJ

Yeah, why not?

DAD

It's there everyday and I have to look

at it.

TJ

When do you look at it? When was the

last time you got off the couch?

DAD

It's not healthy.

TJ

Neither are all the pills you're

taking, but I don't tell you not to

take them.

DAD

I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

(CONTINUED)

5.

CONTINUED:

TJ

I do.

DAD

I don't. And that's it.

GRANDMA

It's OK dear. He just needs time. It's

his first day back tomorrow. Lets try

and be patient.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

One thing at a time dear. One thing at

a time.

DAD

Yeah, I know, mom.

TJ

Can I have some money so I can buy

lunch today?

DAD

Yeah.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

DAD (CONT'D)

Hope you have a nice day Teej.

HESHER

The fuck you think you're doing!?

7.

HESHER

The fuck you think you're doing!?

TJ

Nothing.

HESHER

You got five seconds or I'm gonna cut

your fuckin' nose off.

TJ

I was just, I was just going to

school. I, I didn't know anyone was

here.

HESHER

Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' -

HESHER (CONT'D)

You just fucked me.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)

Who's in there?

SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)

What the hell-

SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Hey! Get back here!

KID 1

Hey, TJ. You're back. Welcome back.

(CONTINUED)

9.

CONTINUED:

KID 2

Hey, Teej. Welcome back, man.

KID 2 (CONT'D)

How you feeling, man?

TJ

(UNENTHUSIASTIC)

Fine.

KID 2

I came by your house a while ago, see

if you wanted to come skateboarding or

something, but it looked like the

place was empty. Have you moved or

something?

KID 1

Yeah, I tried calling you a bunch of

times, but it kept saying there was a

new number or something.

TJ

Yeah, we moved in with my Grandma for

a little while.

KID 1

Oh OK, cool... I didn't want to call

cause I didn't know.

(changing the subject)

You want some of my bagel?

TJ

No. Thanks.

KID 1

Hey, can I be the first one to sign

your cast?

TJ

Ah, if you want I guess, but I'm

getting it off tomorrow, so there's no

point really.

KID 1

OK, cool. Well, welcome back, man.

(CONTINUED)

10.

CONTINUED: (2)

KID 2

Yeah, welcome back, dude.

MRS ELSBERRY

Cerisola? Cimino? Cody? Cooper? Early?

Edgerton? Fletcher?

(LIGHTENS)

Forney. TJ Forney's back. Welcome

back, TJ.

MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)

Folks? Fullwood? Greenberg? Herriman?

Kelman?

COACH

McDonald? Mohajer? Nanden? Paonessa?

Saunders? Sumner?

DUSTIN

S'up now, punk? You don't look so

tough now, do you?

(CONTINUED)

11.

CONTINUED:

TJ

Leave me alone.

DUSTIN

How about you suck my cock?

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Huh? Suck my cock.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Suck my cock.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Suck my cock.

TJ

Yeah, yeah, I heard you. Suck your

cock. Then why don't you pull it out?

DUSTIN

What'd you say, bitch?

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Don't fuckin' talk back to me.

KIDS

Fight, fight, fight...

COUNSELLOR

Look, TJ. I know you've been through a

lot and it's gonna take time to

readjust, but as you know, the school

can't tolerate this kind of behavior.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

12.

CONTINUED:

COUNSELLOR (CONT'D)

I'm willing to give you the benefit of

the doubt this time, but you can't be

starting fights.

TJ

I didn't start anything. He pushed me.

COUNSELLOR

What he did or didn't do isn't

important. What's important is what

you do, and how you react. Do you

understand?

TJ

Not really.

COUNSELLOR

Which part don't you understand?

TJ

I don't understand the part about how

it's not important that he pushed me

and he punched me and he kicked me and

he told me to suck his cock and now

I'm the bad guy sitting in the office.

COUNSELLOR

Hey, hey, hey. I do not wanna hear

that kind of language in my office.

TJ

Yeah, but I didn't -

COUNSELLOR

Listen, I'm gonna cut you some slack,

but you're gonna have to meet me

halfway here.

COUNSELLOR (CONT'D)

I should really be suspending you, but

I won't if you can promise me you'll

put in a real effort...

(noticing TJ looking

ELSEWHERE)

Are you listening?

(CONTINUED)

13.

CONTINUED: (2)

TJ

Yeah, OK.

GRANDMA

Hi, pumpkin.

TJ

Hey.

GRANDMA

How was your day?

TJ

Pretty much sucked.

GRANDMA

Why sweetheart?

TJ

I don't know. It just sucked.

(CONTINUED)

14.

CONTINUED:

TJ (CONT'D)

Do you want me to turn on the light

for you?

GRANDMA

Do I look like I'm sitting in darkness

here?

TJ

I don't know, maybe, a little.

GRANDMA

Maybe I need new glasses?

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

Actually, I don't even know if these

are mine.

TJ

Whose are they?

GRANDMA

Geez, I don't know.

TJ

Well, can you see better with them?

GRANDMA

Jesus, I don't know.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

You know my mother always told me that

I'd damage my eyes if I read by poor

light and I always think about that

when I'm reading, but I've gotten this

far, so why am I still worrying about

it? Why am I even reading? There's

something more I need to learn?

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

I guess there's always something more

to learn.

(CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINUED: (2)

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

Is is your dad up yet?

TJ

No. Why, has he been sleeping all day?

GRANDMA

Well, you know, sometimes people get

knocked off course a little when bad

things happen. But they come good in

the end.

GRANDMA

Here's some milk to wet your whistle.

DAD

Thanks mom.

DAD (CONT'D)

Hey Teej.

TJ

Hey.

GRANDMA

Take some applesauce, sweetheart.

DAD

What's the time?

TJ

It's six o'clock. Have you been

sleeping all day?

(CONTINUED)

16.

CONTINUED:

DAD

I just had to lay down for a bit.

DAD (CONT'D)

How was school?

TJ

Fine. When are you going back to work?

DAD

That's a good question.

TJ

Are you gonna answer it?

DAD

I don't know. I'm not ready yet.

TJ

I'm not ready yet either.

GRANDMA

TJ, would you please pass me the salt?

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

Did you know that when Albert Einstein

interviewed people for a job, he would

take them out for lunch and if they

put salt on their food before tasting

it, he would not give them the job.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

I've always liked that.

17.

DOCTOR

(referring to the smell)

Whoa, that's like an eight week old

dirty sock. OK, so how does that feel?

You wanna turn your wrist like this

for me?

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

And like this.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Any pain or discomfort?

TJ

I don't know. It feels kinda weird, I

can't tell.

DOCTOR

It will feel strange for a few days,

but should start to feel normal again

soon. Alright, lookin' good. I s'pose

I should write you a note for school.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

How's your Dad doing?

TJ

Not great. I don't know. You should

probably just ask him yourself.

(CONTINUED)

18.

CONTINUED:

MRS ELSBERRY

If we consider that dreams serve a

metaphoric function in narrative

fiction, as they do in life, what

metaphoric function would you suggest

the dreams here are serving?

MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)

TJ! What are you doing? Please pass

that forward.

MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)

You can collect this after class.

MRS ELSBERRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

OK, so for our protagonist, are these

dreams premonitions or desires or even

nightmares perhaps?

DUSTIN

You're fuckin' dead.

(CONTINUED)

19.

CONTINUED:

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey!

VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Hey! Leave him alone!

VOICE (CONT'D)

Hey! I said stop it!

NICOLE

Leave him alone!

DUSTIN

What the fuck are you doing lady?

(CONTINUED)

20.

CONTINUED: (2)

NICOLE

What are you doing?!

DUSTIN

(TO TJ)

I'm not finished, you fuck.

NICOLE

Are you alright?

TJ

I don't know.

(BEAT)

Am I bleeding?

NICOLE

I don't think so. Am I?

TJ

I don't know.

NICOLE

I can't believe he called me lady. Do

I look like a lady to you?

TJ

I don't know, I guess?

NICOLE

Thanks. I mean do I look old? Well

anyway, at least I can say I've been

in a fight.

(CONTINUED)

21.

CONTINUED:

NICOLE (CONT'D)

I can't believe he called me lady.

TJ

I think your ice cream's melting.

NICOLE

Oh shit.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Ah, fuck it.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Hey, so I'm kinda like a hero now,

aren't I?

TJ

What?

NICOLE

Well actually, I basically just didn't

want to have to go home and then spend

the rest of the day feeling bad about

the fact that I didn't help you and

then hear about you on the news being

beat to death in the parking lot. So

you know, really I'm just - I did it

for me. I'm just selfish.

(BEAT)

And I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm like

that.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Oh, gas station.

(CONTINUED)

22.

CONTINUED: (2)

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Whoaaa... sorry, sorry.

NICOLE

Perfect landing.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

You like black or red?

TJ

Ah, I don't know, black?

NICOLE

Black? Really? Are you sure?

TJ

OK, red?

NICOLE

OK.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Red it is.

NICOLE

It's super sour isn't it? You don't

have to eat it if you don't like it.

TJ

It's really sour.

(CONTINUED)

23.

CONTINUED:

NICOLE

I know, that's the point. I used to

hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't

know what happened. I just recently

acquired a taste for it. I don't even

really know what's in it, but I pretty

much eat it all the time. And I'm sure

it's making me fat. I just don't want

to end up like those fat old ladies

you sometimes see, you know, the

really fat ones?

NICOLE (CONT'D)

I don't know why I'm telling you this.

Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you

loved these -

NICOLE (CONT'D)

So you could eat 'em for me. But now I

can see you don't like em' and I'm

kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I

guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a

way.

TJ

OK, thanks for the ride. I really

appreciate it.

NICOLE

Hey!

NICOLE (CONT'D)

You want your bike?

(CONTINUED)

24.

CONTINUED:

TJ

Shit.

TJ (CONT'D)

Thanks.

GRANDMA

Hi, TJ. What you doing around the

back?

TJ

I just, I dunno. I was just dumping my

bike.

TJ (CONT'D)

(CALLING)

Hey, Dad!

GRANDMA

Your Dad's gone to the supermarket,

honey. Everything OK?

TJ

Ah, yeah, OK.

25.

HESHER

Where's the laundry room?

TJ

My dad'll be home soon.

HESHER

Where's the laundry room?

TJ

Why?

HESHER

You've got two seconds to tell me

where the laundry room is before I

tear your fuckin' head off and skull

fuck you.

TJ

It's through there. But why? You can't

- my dad's gonna be home soon.

TJ

What are you doing? You can't -

(CONTINUED)

26.

CONTINUED:

HESHER

I swear to god. I'll cut your face

off.

TJ

You can't smoke in here.

TJ (CONT'D)

You can't smoke.

TJ (CONT'D)

What are you doing? You can't smoke in

here.

TJ (CONT'D)

Will you please put it out?

HESHER

Can I put it out in your mouth?

TJ

What?! Wait.

GRANDMA

I'm gonna make a cake. Do you remember

my cherry cake story?

(CONTINUED)

27.

CONTINUED:

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

I used to make a cherry cake all the

time and it always came out just

wonderful. One time I invited my

doctor and his wife and I wanted to

make an impression. I asked him to

come see your dad in a play and he

came and I said, 'would you like to

come back to the house?'

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

And he said, or his wife said, 'yes

they'd like to come back.' So earlier

that day I made a cherry cake and I

used a - I didn't know it till

afterwards, I used a new product -

instead of Crisco, I used Fluffo. They

never made it again that Fluffo.

TJ

Grandma, can I hear the rest of your

story later? I'm kinda busy.

GRANDMA

Oh, of course honey.

DAD

TJ, who's this?

HESHER

My name's Hesher. Call me Hesher.

(CONTINUED)

28.

CONTINUED:

DAD

(TO TJ)

What's he doing?

TJ

He's doing laundry.

DAD

Why is he smoking in the house?

TJ

I don't know.

DAD

Did you tell him he can't?

TJ

Yes.

HESHER

How come you only have four channels?

GRANDMA

Hello there.

HESHER

Hello, old lady.

(CONTINUED)

29.

CONTINUED:

DAD

(TO HESHER)

Can I help you with something?

HESHER

Nope, I'm good.

HESHER

Motherfucker.

(CONTINUED)

30.

CONTINUED:

TJ

So, ah, what are you doing now?

HESHER

Huh?

HESHER (CONT'D)

(LOUD)

This your room?

TJ

(huh?)

That's the garage.

GRANDMA

Does your friend want to eat some

dinner dear?

TJ

He's not hungry.

GRANDMA

Are you sure?

TJ

Yeah, I'm sure.

DAD

What's he doing in the garage?

(CONTINUED)

31.

CONTINUED:

TJ

I don't know. I said he could practice

his guitar in there.

GRANDMA

That's great honey, it's nice having a

bit of music in the house again. Is he

a new friend?

TJ

Yeah, sort of.

GRANDMA

You know your grandfather played the

harmonica for many years.

GRANDMA (LOUDLY)

Hesher, would you like a glass of

orange juice.

HESHER (O.S.)

Ah, yeah. Sure.

GRANDMA

Morning, TJ.

TJ

Hi, Grandma.

(CONTINUED)

32.

CONTINUED:

GRANDMA

Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of

milk. I can cook you up some eggs if

you like, dear.

TJ

No, thanks. I don't have time.

GRANDMA

Would you like to come for a walk with

me today?

TJ

I can't, Grandma. I gotta go to

school.

GRANDMA

No, I mean later. This afternoon.

TJ

I don't know. Can you ask me when I

get home?

GRANDMA

OK, honey.

33.

LARRY

Yes?

TJ

I need to talk to you.

LARRY

Oh, yeah? What about?

TJ

I want to get the car back.

LARRY

Yeah, I figured that. You made it

pretty clear the last time you were

here, and I thought I made it pretty

clear that I couldn't give it to you.

TJ

What do I need to do to get it back?

LARRY

The car's not for sale.

TJ

I want to get it back, though. How

much do you want for it?

LARRY

I don't know. We're talking at least

eighteen hundred dollars, not

including taxes, registration, ADM, or

dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd

need a driver's license. I'm guessing

you don't have one of those. You'd

need valid car insurance. I'm guessing

you don't have that either. But even

if you did have these things, I still

couldn't sell it to you because the

car's not street legal. There's a

million reasons why I can't sell it to

you.

(CONTINUED)

34.

CONTINUED:

LARRY (CONT'D)

Look kid, I appreciate your

enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't

know what to tell you. You can't have

the car. End of story.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Do you mind if I get back to it here?

DUSTIN

You're lucky I'm at work right now.

NICOLE

Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey.

TJ

Hey.

NICOLE

How's it goin'?

TJ

I got you a replacement ice cream.

NICOLE

Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks.

(CONTINUED)

35.

CONTINUED:

TJ

I paid for it over there.

NICOLE

Oh, OK.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Thanks.

TJ

(NERVOUS)

Sure, OK. See ya.

NICOLE

See ya.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

(to next customer)

Hi.

(CONTINUED)

36.

CONTINUED:

GRANDMA

- and his wife said, yes they'd like

to come back to the house.' So earlier

that day I made a cherry cake and I

used a new product - I didn't know it

till afterwards- I used Fluffo. They

never made it again that Fluffo. It

was an imitation brand. I served the

cake and there was silence. And then -

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

(LAUGHING)

You put the cake in your mouth and it

stuck to the roof of your mouth. They

could hardly swallow it.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

(STILL LAUGHING)

Hi sweetheart.

GRANDMA

So who's coming for a walk with me

tomorrow morning?

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

TJ?

TJ

I can't Grandma. I have school

tomorrow.

GRANDMA

Ok, well you're always invited.

(CONTINUED)

37.

CONTINUED:

HESHER

So what?

HESHER (CONT'D)

So what school? Go on a walk with your

Grandma.

GRANDMA

He's right TJ, it'd be very good for

you to get some fresh air.

HESHER

Your Grandma goes walking in the

morning by herself? You can't get your

ass outta bed like an hour earlier?

She could get raped.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I read about this shit all the time.

Grandmas get raped. You ever hear

about that guy who killed like 13 old

ladies.

TJ

What?

HESHER

Fuckin' Google it, dude. The Granny

Killer, he killed like hella old

ladies by strangling them with their

dirty panties.

(taking a mouthful)

Not all of them necessarily got

fucked, but they all got penetrated by

like the dude's fingers and I don't

know, other shit too.

DAD

That's enough.

(CONTINUED)

38.

CONTINUED: (2)

HESHER

(TO TJ)

I just think your Grandma asks you to

go on a walk, you should go with her

so she doesn't get raped.

GRANDMA

Why would anyone rape me?

HESHER

I don't know, they do it, Grandma.

There's some sick fucks out there.

DAD

That's enough.

KID 1

Hey, Teej. What are you doing? Come

sit with us, we're in our spot.

TJ

What? Uh, Ok.

TJ (CONT'D)

I'll meet you there in a second.

(CONTINUED)

39.

CONTINUED:

TJ

What are you doing here?

HESHER

Pissing.

TJ

What are you doing at my school?

HESHER

I'm putting out a fire.

DUSTIN

You fucked my car, you little prick.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Eat the cake.

(CONTINUED)

40.

CONTINUED:

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

Fuckin' eat it.

DUSTIN (CONT'D)

It's your birthday. Eat your fuckin'

cake.

DAD

You ready?

TJ

I don't wanna go.

DAD

It'll be good for us, Teej. C'mon.

We'll be late.

TJ

I really don't want to go.

DAD

I don't think anyone ever 'wants to

go' to these things. It's supposed to

be good for us. That's the whole

point.

DAD (CONT'D)

C'mon. Give me a hand here.

41.

MERYL

OK, so welcome everyone to the

Transformational Grief Group. My name

is Meryl. We should start off by going

around the circle and introducing

ourselves and briefly explaining why

we are here. Hi Miss, would you please

start us off?

COLEEN

We are the Bolder family. I am Coleen

and this is my husband Jack. Our

daughter Cynthia was murdered last

year.

(she chokes a bit)

She was the victim of a violent attack

that was unfair and sick.

COLEEN (CONT'D)

We are here because we need help. We

lost our baby and we are broken.

JACK

Hi, my name is Jack. As my wife said,

we're here hoping for some answers and

just some help with the pain.

MERYL

Thank you, Coleen and Jack. Welcome.

MERYL (CONT'D)

Sir.

42.

CONTINUED:

DAD

Ah, OK. Sure. My name is Paul Forney.

This is my son, TJ. We're here today

because we lost my wife, TJ's mother,

a bit more than two months ago now.

And ah, I don't know, we're still

trying to come to terms with things

and, you know, just find some guidance

of some kind, I guess, and, ah, yeah,

so...

MERYL

OK, great. Welcome, Paul. TJ? Would

you like to introduce yourself, say a

few words to the group?

TJ

Not really.

MERYL

OK. That's OK.

(to the person next to TJ)

Nicholas, would you like to introduce

yourself to the group?

(CONTINUED)

43.

CONTINUED:

GRANDMA

Hi, honey. How was your special group?

TJ

Fine.

TJ

Fuck you!

HESHER

Fuck you.

TJ

Fuck you. You let that fuck stick my

head in a toilet and you don't do

anything about it? You stand there and

fucking watch him do it?

TJ (CONT'D)

You stay in my grandma's house? You're

taking a bath in my fucking grandma's

bath?

TJ (CONT'D)

Say something!

HESHER

(CALM)

Listen to me.

(CONTINUED)

44.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I'm gonna put some clothes on, then

you're gonna meet me in my van.

TJ

Where are we going?

TJ (CONT'D)

Where are we going?

HESHER

Touch my stereo again, I'll seriously

fucking hurt you.

TJ

What are we doing?

TJ

What are we -

TJ

Hey, seriously. What are you doing?

TJ (CONT'D)

Come on. This is insane. Let's get out

of here.

TJ (CONT'D)

C'mon, man. Let's just go.

What's wrong with you?

HESHER

What's the problem? That's the guy who

put you in the toilet.

TJ

Yeah, but -

HESHER

(WHISPERS)

Something's coming.

48.

HESHER

It's for you.

COP

Are you Thomas Forney?

TJ

(toothbrush in mouth)

Yeah.

COP

We'd like to ask you some questions.

TJ

What about?

COP

We'd like you to come down to the

station with us.

TJ

What for?

DAD (O.S.)

What's going on?

(CONTINUED)

49.

CONTINUED:

HESHER

(TO DAD)

Cops.

COP

OK, so we're gonna have to let you go

now. We may very well be calling on

you again very soon, but in the

meantime, let this be a warning to

you. Regardless of what evidence we do

or don't find, you've come to our

attention today. Our attention isn't

good.

TJ

But I didn't do anything.

COP

You hearing me here? These are very

serious crimes we've been presented

with. Let's just say someone had been

in that car, and they'd burned - to

death. We'd be talking about

manslaughter, possibly murder. Have

you thought about that? You'd be

sitting here with detectives from

Homicide right now. These are felony

offences we're talking about, son.

Serious jail-time offences.

50.

DAD

Did you do it?

TJ

Not really.

DAD

Not really?

TJ

I didn't do it.

DAD

What does `not really' mean?

DAD (CONT'D)

Tell me what `not really' means.

TJ

It means I didn't do it.

DAD

No, it doesn't. Why would you say 'not

really'?

TJ

I didn't.

DAD

You did. I heard you.

TJ

I said I didn't do it.

DAD

Yeah, before that. I asked if you did

it. You said `not really'.

TJ

I can't remember what I said.

DAD

Why would you do something like that?

(CONTINUED)

51.

HESHER

Howdy.

HESHER

So what'd the pigs want?

TJ

What the fuck do you think!?

HESHER

Did they give you a cavity search?

TJ

What?

HESHER

Did any of the cops put their fingers

in your butthole?

TJ

Just fuck off, OK.

HESHER

What'd they do?

TJ

They took my fucking finger prints!

HESHER

So what?

TJ

So what!? I can get into serious

trouble.

HESHER

Oh, is that right?

(CONTINUED)

52.

CONTINUED:

TJ

Yeah, that's right! They don't take

this shit lightly.

HESHER

Oh, they don't?

TJ

People could have been hurt! If

someone was killed it would have been

considered murder.

HESHER

Really? Murder?

(BEAT)

That's badass shit.

TJ

Please just leave me alone.

HESHER

OK, but first show me your best

impression of a dumpling.

TJ

What?

HESHER

You know, a dumpling, the Chinese

little thingies you eat -

HESHER (CONT'D)

Come on, like this -

HESHER (CONT'D)

OK, your turn.

TJ

No.

(CONTINUED)

53.

CONTINUED: (2)

HESHER

OK.

HESHER

Do you think she is totally bald or do

you think she's more of a landing

strip kind of chick or more of a 70's

jungle bitch.

TJ

What are doing here?

HESHER

You're stalking that chick, dude.

TJ

No, I'm not.

HESHER

Yeah, you are. I've been stalking you

for half an hour. You gonna try to

fuck her?

TJ

What? No.

HESHER

Can't fuck her from here, dude. Gotta

be way closer.

TJ

Shut up about it.

HESHER

You wanna poke her clam?

TJ

Shut up.

(CONTINUED)

54.

CONTINUED:

HESHER

You wanna poke her clam or what?

TJ

Please stop saying that.

HESHER

You want to poke her clam, dude.

Nothing wrong with that. Don't be

ashamed about it. Humans have been

poking vagina for hundreds of years.

Longer even.

HESHER (CONT'D)

Bro, there's nothing wrong with

wanting a little pussy.

HESHER

Where you going?

TJ

Home.

HESHER

I'll give you a ride.

TJ

No thanks.

HESHER

OK, but if you come with me it'll take

5 minutes and if you ride it will take

you about 15.

(CONTINUED)

55.

CONTINUED:

HESHER (CONT'D)

Come on dude, don't be silly, let's

just car pool.

TJ

Fine, just don't talk to me.

HESHER

I won't say shit.

HESHER

Look dude, I'm really sorry about the

fire the other night -

HESHER (CONT'D)

That was totally out of control.

Foolish and irresponsible actually.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I want you to have this -

TJ

Get that away from me.

HESHER

Dude are you gay? I can't work you

out.

(CONTINUED)

56.

TJ

Hey, what are you doing?

TJ (CONT'D)

Stop the car, I want to get out.

HESHER

Shush.

HESHER (CONT'D)

You get out of this van, I'll rip your

dick off and fuck her for you.

HESHER

Whoops.

NICOLE

I'm sorry. I didn't -

DRIVER

You just messed up the back of my car

you stupid idiot. You need to pay

attention when you're driving a

fucking car -

HESHER (O.S.)

I think I can help here.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I saw the whole thing. The chick here

was stopped and you reversed right

into her.

DRIVER

What?

HESHER

I don't know what your fucking problem

is, dude. Why would you just reverse

into her? That's fuckin' retarded.

DRIVER

What are you talking about?

DRIVER

Are you out of your mind?

HESHER

You better start making like you're

gonna pay her for the damage.

DRIVER

I didn't back into her. I don't know

what you're talking about.

HESHER

You calling me a fucking liar, dude!?

(CONTINUED)

No, I, I, I'm just saying I don't know

You're calling me a fucking liar is

HESHER (CONT'D)

Let's go.

DRIVER

Look, I don't want any trouble, sir.

HESHER

Fight me cocksucker!

DRIVER

This is ridiculous -

HESHER

Come back here and find out how

ridiculous it is!

HESHER (CONT'D)

OK. See you later.

TJ

Come on man, let's just go.

HESHER

Your sexy girlfriend's in trouble.

We're not going anywhere.

HESHER (CONT'D)

You know, TJ?

TJ

Hey.

NICOLE

Sometimes, you know, a day is bad and

then when you think it couldn't get

any worse you suddenly discover whole

new ways it can get worse.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

No, thanks.

(CONTINUED)

60.

CONTINUED:

HESHER

This one time I had like four hella

drunk chicks in the back of the van,

and we were going for it and I had one

hand on this one girl's tit and my

other hand on this other chick's twat,

but there was like still two other

girls wanting to get off so like I had

my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole

while I'm trying to eat the other girl

out, and I was going crazy man. It was

too much. I couldn't work out which

chick was which and I'm making one

girl cum but then I'm forgetting about

the others and my tongue's hurting and

my fingers are getting tired and like

eventually I was just like 'Fuck this.

This is too much' and I just stepped

back. I just stepped back. And before

you know it these girls are all

working on each other, you know.

They're all fingering each other and

eating each other out, you know, and I

jerk myself off and everyone's a

winner, you know?

NICOLE

Was that some kind of perverted

metaphor for me? About how I should

just step back and let things work

themselves out?

HESHER

A what?

(CONTINUED)

61.

NICOLE

What the hell was that?

HESHER

I saw a mouse.

NICOLE

What?

NICOLE (CONT'D)

(TO TJ)

Are you OK?

TJ

I have dirt in my mouth.

NICOLE

Who's that guy?

HESHER

We're here. Come on, let's go.

NICOLE

We're where?

HESHER

My uncle's house.

(CONTINUED)

62.

NICOLE

What was that back there?

HESHER

What was what?

NICOLE

That other house?

HESHER

Wrong house.

NICOLE

What the fuck!?

HESHER

What? You're dirty.

NICOLE

Yeah, and now I'm wet.

HESHER

You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in...

HESHER (CONT'D)

Now I'm dirty and wet too.

(CONTINUED)

63.

NICOLE

Cut it out.

HESHER

R2! Shut down all the fucken' trash

compactors on the detention level!

HESHER (CONT'D)

...All the fucking trash compactors...

(underwater, then up again)

...on the detention level!...

HESHER (CONT'D)

Oh, shit. More trash coming in!

HESHER (CONT'D)

Oh shit!

NICOLE

So, how do you know this guy?

TJ

I don't know, he's sort of moved into

my grandma's house with us.

(CONTINUED)

64.

CONTINUED: (2)

NICOLE

What, like he's renting a room or

something?

TJ

No, not really, I don't know, it's

kinda a long story.

NICOLE

Do you realize that the equivalent to

you flicking that ant would be like

one of us getting hit in the face by a

giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an

hour and getting thrown into the next

yard?

TJ

Sorry, I...

NICOLE

Do you think the other ants are gonna

wonder where that ant's gone? Do you

think their gonna miss her?

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ.

HESHER

Jump in the fi-re.

HESHER (CONT'D)

FUCK YOU BITCHES!!!

Shit, look at that.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I got a doctor's appointment.

TJ

What?

HESHER (O.S.)

(YELLS)

It burns when I urinate...

NICOLE

Did he just leave us? I think we

should get out of here.

TJ

My shoes are so squishy.

NICOLE

So, what's his name?

TJ

Hesher.

(CONTINUED)

66.

NICOLE

Hesher?... Is that a name?

TJ

I don't know. I guess?

NICOLE

Does he have a last name?

TJ

I don't know.

NICOLE

How old is he?

TJ

I don't know.

NICOLE

Do you know anything about him?

TJ

Not really.

NICOLE

That was so lucky you guys were behind

me when that guy got all mad about his

car. I was freaking out. I don't

really have any insurance right now. I

just can't afford it. There's no way I

could afford to fix that guy's car.

How do people do this stuff? I mean, I

have a job. It's kind of a joke

though. I've been there for like a

year and I'm still only doing like

five hours a week. Why aren't they

giving me any more hours? Do you think

it's because they think I suck? Did

you think I sucked when I served you

at the checkout?

TJ

(UNSURE)

No?

NICOLE

I don't even get paid enough to really

cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start

selling shit pretty soon.

(CONTINUED)

67.

CONTINUED: (2)

TJ

Here, I got two bucks.

NICOLE

The sad thing is I could actually use

it.

NICOLE

Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a

ticket...

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Fuck, fuck, fuck it.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Ah, shit. Fuck it.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

What have I done to deserve this chain

reaction of shit all the time?

Sometimes I wonder if I were to die

right now, if anyone would care, or

even notice.

TJ

I would.

(CONTINUED)

68.

CONTINUED:

NICOLE

That's nice of you to say, but I doubt

it.

TJ

I would. If you died right now.

(BEAT)

I'd notice.

TJ (CONT'D)

Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car

with a dead lady.

NICOLE

Please don't call me lady.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Let's get out of here.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

You wanna steer or push?

Where were you today?

TJ

What?

DAD

Counselling - 3:30, I'm there by

myself.

TJ

Oh, sorry. I forgot.

DAD

Yeah, that's real nice. This thing is

for you just as much as it is for me.

I waited outside school for 45

minutes.

TJ

Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to

go.

DAD

Maybe you should let me know before

you don't show up next time.

TJ

I did. I told you I didn't want to go.

I told you a hundred times.

DAD

No you didn't.

TJ

Yes I did. You're just not listening.

DAD

No you didn't. What you told me was

that you didn't want to go. You didn't

tell me that you were just not going

to show up.

(CONTINUED)

70.

CONTINUED: (2)

TJ

What difference does it make?

DAD

For me a big difference. It means, I'm

sitting on a fucking beanbag in a room

full of losers by myself.

GRANDMA

Boys please, I'm not feeling well.

DAD

(TO HESHER)

Can you pass me my pills?

HESHER

(discreetly, to TJ)

Did you finger her twat?

TJ

Shut the fuck up.

DAD

(SWALLOWING PILLS)

TJ.

TJ

What?

DAD

Language. I don't wanna hear it.

TJ

Did you hear what he just said?

DAD

I don't care. If I hear it again,

you're going to your room.

(CONTINUED)

71.

CONTINUED: (3)

TJ

My room!? You gonna start punishing me

now?

DAD

Maybe I need to. If it's not the

language, then it's your lack of

responsibility... or I'm having to

escort you down to the police station.

TJ

Shit, dad. I'm really sorry you had

your ass dragged off the couch. I'm

sorry you had to put some fucking

underpants on for the first time in

months.

DAD

TJ.

TJ

What?!

DAD

That's enough.

TJ

Oh, what, soon as I'm right, that's

enough?!

DAD

TJ! I don't want to hear one more word

from you!

TJ

Fine. Fuck this.

DAD

That make you feel better?

(CONTINUED)

GRANDMA

Did I miss something?

HESHER

(MOUTH FULL)

Not really. Paul came in and said some

dumb shit which TJ got angry about and

so TJ smashed his plate and then Paul

smashed his plate too but I got a

feeling he smashed his one cuz he

couldn't actually think of anything to

say cuz he kinda knew TJ had a point

and so now he feels bad about it and

so he's gone somewhere.

(takes another mouthful)

I don't know where.

GRANDMA

Those boys have been through a lot.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

Sometimes I wonder if they're ever

gonna smile again

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

I just wish there was something more I

could do.

bacon?

GRANDMA

A worm? I don't know. I'm going to lie

down. I'm not feeling well. I'm very

nauseated.

HESHER

Oh, OK.

HESHER

Did you figure it out yet?

GRANDMA

Figure what out, dear?

Kermit the frog's finger.

GRANDMA

What?

HESHER

HESHER (CONT'D)

Woah, what's that?

GRANDMA

Oh, I'm feeling very nauseated.

They're medical cigarettes that help

me with the nausea. Will you light a

match for me, dear?

HESHER

(IMPRESSED)

Hang on a second. Can I see that?

HESHER (CONT'D)

No shit.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I'll be right back.

HESHER (CONT'D)

May I?

(CONTINUED)

75.

CONTINUED: (2)

GRANDMA

What is that?

HESHER

It's a bong. The water filters the

smoke. It's probably the most healthy

way to smoke weed.

HESHER (CONT'D)

OK, so basically cover the hole here

with your thumb then suck on the top

and once the chamber fills with smoke,

take your finger off the hole and suck

in.

HESHER (CONT'D)

Then try and hold the smoke in for as

long as possible, OK bro?

GRANDMA

Umm, OK.

HESHER

Ok, lift your finger.

GRANDMA

Oh, wow... That was a big one.

HESHER

Yeah, that was good. Hit it again.

(CONTINUED)

GRANDMA

I think I'm OK, dear.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)

Honey, how old are you?

HESHER

Who wants to know?

GRANDMA

I don't know. You seem a little older

than TJ.

HESHER

Who?

GRANDMA

Oh, stop it. Aren't you a little old

to be hanging around TJ all the time?

HESHER

Aren't you?

GRANDMA

No, I'm his grandmother.

HESHER

Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK,

well I used to have a mouse. No,

wait... hang on a minute. I used to

have a snake. And do you know what

snakes eat?

GRANDMA

Actually, there's no limit to the food

items that you can even think of that

a snake might eat. Whatever is

available in abundance would become

the prey for the snakes. Depending on

their growth, their diet -

HESHER

Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat

mice.

(CONTINUED)

77.

CONTINUED: (4)

GRANDMA

They do eat mice. A lot of times

snakes eat other snakes because

they're the right shape -

HESHER

Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to

have a snake and I fed it mice. But

one time I fed this little fuckin'

mouse to my snake and that mouse was

tough. I dropped that mouse in the

snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go

near him, and any time he tried that

mouse would just smack him with his

little, you know...

HESHER (CONT'D)

With his little mouse hand. So instead

of eating the mouse the snake just

curled up crying in the corner and the

mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And

this went on for weeks, the snake

wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse

used to sit in a little miniature lawn

chair scratching his balls and

shelling peanuts and this snake was

just too scared to go near it. And cuz

the snake was scared of that mouse I

had to feed him other mice, but every

time I dropped another mouse in the

tank, it'd hide behind the brave

mouse. And so eventually the snake

starved to death. I had a cage full of

mice.

GRANDMA

So is TJ the mouse?

HESHER

Maybe he is.

GRANDMA

Well then, what am I?

HESHER

You're an old lady.

(CONTINUED)

No, I'm a grandmother.

HESHER

Yes you are. And you know what

grandmother? I'm gonna go on a walk

with you in the morning.

GRANDMA

Oh, that's nice. Where are you going?

HESHER

I'm not going anywhere. I'm going with

you. Around the block, I guess.

GRANDMA

Oh, OK, well have a nice time. I'll

see you when you get back.

CONTINUED: (3)

HESHER

I just saved you.

TJ

You cut his nose off.

HESHER

Only a bit, it's just a cut.

TJ

You just cut his nose off!

HESHER

What are you talking about?

TJ

Hold this against your face.

TJ (CONT'D)

You gotta stop the bleeding.

DUSTIN

Oh my god!

HESHER

What's your problem?

TJ

I want you outta my life. I'm serious.

I never want to see you again. How

many times do I have say it?

Pizza's here, I need money.

(CONTINUED)

94.

CONTINUED:

TJ (CONT'D)

(yells into the house)

OK, pizza's here.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

(YELLING BACK)

Alright, let's do it.

MOM

Teej, c'mon sweetheart. We have to go.

We're going to be late.

TJ

What about the pizza?

MOM

We'll eat it in the car.

MOM (CONT'D)

(TO DAD)

Honey, will you grab the present?

DAD

Holy crap, what is this thing?

DAD (CONT'D)

Ah, slight problem.

MOM

We'll take my car.

DAD

Sure thing.

95.

FLASHBACK

DAD

I think we should keep the new one and

give them our old one.

MOM

That's a great idea. I'll be sure to

let them know that our dirty old

microwave is a gift from you.

DAD

Good. I'm not even sure they know who

I am.

MOM

Honey, they're my friends. Please.

DAD

OK, I just don't understand why they

get so many presents.

MOM

A microwave and a bottle of scotch is

hardly a lot of presents.

DAD

And flowers.

TJ

(mouth full of pizza)

Mom can you turn on the radio?

MOM

Sure honey. How about some oldies?

TJ

Oldies but goodies.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MOM

(TO DAD)

Honey?

MARIO

Ricky!

(YELLS LOUDER)

Ricky! Kill it, man.

RICKY

What?

MARIO

Kill it! There's someone in the car!

(CONTINUED)

97.

CONTINUED:

MARIO

What the hell are you doing?

TJ

I don't know.

MARIO

What were you doing in there?

TJ

I don't know. I'm sorry.

MARIO

This car's about to get crushed. If I

didn't see you, you would be dead.

TJ

I know.

MARIO

What were you thinking, man?

DAD

Where have you been?

(CONTINUED)

98.

CONTINUED:

TJ

Sorry.

DAD

Where have you been?

TJ

I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

DAD

You lost track of time? It's ten in

the morning!

TJ

I'm sorry.

DAD

I've been up all night. How is that

fair to me?

TJ

I don't know.

DAD

Just go to your room.

DAD (O.S.)

There's someone at the front door for

you.

TJ

Hesher's not here.

NICOLE

I came to see you.

(CONTINUED)

99.

CONTINUED:

TJ

Why? What do you want?

NICOLE

I wanted to tell you something.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

I didn't know if I should come here or

not, but I couldn't stop thinking

about it. I thought maybe if I came

you'd still just be really angry at me

and hate me, but then I thought if I

didn't you'd think I didn't care and

you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I

might as well come, just in case, so

here I am.

TJ

Yeah, well what do you want?

NICOLE

I want to apologize. I feel bad about

what happened. I didn't take your

feelings into consideration -

TJ

Yeah, well, whatever. It doesn't

really matter. I have to go.

NICOLE

Yes it does. It does to me. I like

you, TJ. We're friends.

NICOLE (CONT'D)

I understand if you don't want to be

my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your

feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't

know. I just wanted to come around and

say all that, but maybe you still hate

me and so it doesn't matter, but I

just came round to say that, but I've

said it now, so I should just go. So,

OK, bye.

TJ

I'm sorry I broke your lamp.

(CONTINUED)

100.

CONTINUED: (2)

NICOLE

It's OK.

TJ

And I'm sorry I called you a fat

prostitute.

NICOLE

It's OK.

TJ

You're not fat.

NICOLE

But I'm a prostitute?

TJ

I dunno. Maybe.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

Excuse me, Mr. Forney, may I have a

word?

(CONTINUED)

101.

CONTINUED:

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

I hate to have to do this here, but

there's a couple of things I need to

discuss with you quickly, if that's

OK.

DAD

Ah, sure.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

I know that we discussed your

preferences for some aspects of

today's service, including your choice

of the cedar casket which the

insurance company had covered.

Unfortunately we were out of those and

instead we've chosen a mahogany

casket. Now there is an extra charge

for the mahogany which I need to clear

with you before we proceed. Is that

OK?

DAD

Ah, I guess.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

OK, great, thank you. If you could

just sign here.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Just at the bottom there.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Just here, Mr. Forney, just under

that... yes, that's great.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Now, just one other thing - we have

another service following yours today,

we hate to do this, but we're going to

have to try to get through yours as

quickly as possible.

(CONTINUED)

102.

CONTINUED: (2)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

I don't want you to feel rushed, but

we are really under the pump today and

I just thought I should give you the

heads up. Now, I notice, just looking

at your order of service... (beat,

thinking) Ah, look, let's play it by

ear. We should be fine.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

OK. Excuse me.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

We are gathered here today to mourn

the loss and commemorate the life of

Madeleine Frances Forney.

(to arriving late comers)

Ah, if you could please take your

seats as quickly as possible that'd be

great. Thank you.

(he waits a beat)

Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother,

grandmother and friend. And now Mrs

Agnes Rosowski, a dear friend and

neighbor, will say a few quick words.

MRS ROSOWSKI

I did not know Madeleine long enough,

but from the moment I moved into the

neighborhood so many years ago, she

treated me as though I was part of the

family.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

103.

CONTINUED:

MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)

Madeleine always had open arms and

welcomed friends as kindly as her own.

She had such a kind wonderful heart.

MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)

We shared so many wonderful walks and

enjoyed each other's company very

much. I will miss our walks. I will

miss our talks and most of all, I will

miss Madeleine. I will always remember

what she told me, life is like

walking in the rain, you can either

hide and take shelter or you can just

get wet. She was dear to me and she

will always have a place in my heart.

MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)

I love you, Madeleine.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

OK, thank you, Agnes...

MRS ROSOWSKI

TJ, I think you should say something.

MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)

Go on, TJ.

TJ

Sorry.

(CONTINUED)

104.

CONTINUED: (2)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

OK, so at this point we should

conclude today's service with a

moment's silence, after which lemonade

will be served in the...

HESHER

Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's

speech. I think I know where he was

going with that.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

I'm sorry, sir...

DAD

What are you doing here?

HESHER

Hey, hey, hey...

HESHER (CONT'D)

What are you doing? Get your fuckin'

hands off that box.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

I'm sorry, sir we really need to-

HESHER

Um...

(CONTINUED)

105.

CONTINUED: (3)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

I'm sorry, sir-

HESHER

You touch me again, I'll rip your

fucking head off and skull fuck you.

HESHER (CONT'D)

Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't

want me here and I don't want to

fucking be here, but I'm not here for

me, I'm fuckin' here for her-

HESHER (CONT'D)

- and I'm not fuckin' here to say

goodbye or have my farewell or

whatever the fuck you assholes call it

- this is not how I want to say

goodbye to someone I like - in this

shit-hole with these-

HESHER (CONT'D)

- fuckin' assholes.

DAD

OK, this is enough-

HESHER

Yeah, well why don't you shut up for

a second and listen cause I'm going to

say what I want to say and then you'll

never see me again. Alright?!

(CONTINUED)

106.

CONTINUED: (4)

HESHER (CONT'D)

I'm here cause she's been trying to

tell you guys something, but you don't

want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin'

break it down.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I pulled the gas tank from an old

Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it

up, so I did. I didn't think about the

millions of bits of metal that were

gonna fly in every direction. I almost

killed myself. I woke up in a

hospital. I couldn't remember what

happened and then this doctor at the

end of my bed said 'son', and I said,

'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt',

then he said, 'you blew off your nut'.

Some shrapnel had penetrated my left

scrotal sack and ripped the furry

sucker right off. My left fucking nut

was gone, just like that.

HESHER (CONT'D)

I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a

doctor or two, I can't remember. I got

arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all

I could think about day and night was

my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat

or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut

back. I had to get out of there and

find it, so I busted out of juvie and

went lookin' for it. I looked for

days, but didn't find shit.

HESHER (CONT'D)

And then one night I was taking a shit

and I was just staring down at my

balls, looking at my flabby piece of

sack where my left nut used to be and

then I noticed my right nut, for like

the first time. My right nut was just

sitting there, totally happy, just

hanging out.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

107.

CONTINUED: (5)

HESHER (CONT'D)

All this time I'd been driving myself

crazy thinking about my missing nut

and not thinking about the nut I still

had all along. And I realized, I've

still got a nut. I've still got one

good nut. God or the Devil or whoever

left me with one good nut. At least I

didn't lose both my nuts. I've still

got one good nut and it works, and my

dick works too.

HESHER (CONT'D)

You lost your mom. You lost your wife.

I lost a nut.

HESHER (CONT'D)

Fuck this.

HESHER (CONT'D)

Leave her alone. We're not finished

yet.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

(POLITELY)

Unfortunately sir, we need to be.

HESHER

I told Grandma I was going on a walk

with her and I'm gonna do it!

(CONTINUED)

108.

CONTINUED: (6)

TJ -

HESHER (CONT'D)

You promised Grandma you'd go on a

walk with her. This is your last

chance.

(CONTINUED)

109.

CONTINUED:

OFFICER

(SMILING)

You'll get him to bed now, won't you?

DAD

That's the plan.

HESHER

Get your hands off me, pig.

DAD

That's the plan.

TJ

Come in.

DAD

Morning, Teej.

TJ

Hey. Look at you.

DAD

I know. It feels weird. I can feel air

on my face.

TJ

I hardly recognize you.

(CONTINUED)

110.

CONTINUED:

DAD

I think Hesher's gone.

TJ

Gone where?

DAD

I don't know. But I think you should

come take a look at this.
