does oppression...It is in such twilight that

we all must be aware of change in the air

- however slight - lest we become victims of

the darkness."

DIRECTOR JOSEF

You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.

JEROME

--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?

DIRECTOR JOSEF

I reviewed your flight plan.  Not one error

in a hundred thousand keystrokes.  Phenomenal.

(placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder)

It's right that someone like you is taking us

to the Belt.

(glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)

You have a substance test.

LAMAR

(staring admiringly at the discharge)

Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command.

You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told

you that, Jerome?

JEROME

(deadpan as he continues to urinate)

Only every time I'm in here.

LAMAR

I see a lot of cocks.  I speak from experience.

Yours is a beautiful example.  Why didn't my

folks order a cock like that for me?

"VALID"

.

LAMAR

(walking Jerome to the door)

If everything goes to plan, this could be the

last time I see you for a while.  One week to

go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.

JEROME

I'll tell you at the end of the week.

JEROME (VO)

The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome

Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days

away from a one-year manned mission to 951

Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so

unique in that.  Last year over one thousand

citizens from every walk of life embarked on

some space mission or other.  Besides,

selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed

at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical

and intellectual gifts required for such an

arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second

to none.

JEROME (VO)

No, there is truly nothing remarkable about

the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I

am not Jerome Morrow.

JEROME (VO)

I was conceived in the Riviera.  Not the

French

Riviera.

JEROME (VO)

The

Detroit

variety.

JEROME (VO)

They used to say that a child conceived in love,

has a greater chance of happiness.  They don't

say that any more.

NURSE

What are you doing?

MARIA

(shaking her head)

I can't do this.

NURSE

(misinterpreting the problem)

I told you, the government pays.  It's all

taken care of.

MARIA

No, you don't understand.  I

can't

.

NURSE

(reassuring)

The doctor will give you something.

MARIA

(removing the hand, adamant)

I'm not doing it.

NURSE

(trying to make her see reason)

Honey, you've made

one

mistake--

NURSE

(softening her tone)

--I've read your profile.  I don't

know about the father but you carry

enough hereditary factors on your own.

(pause)

You can have other children.

MARIA

(holding her swollen stomach protectively)

Not like

this

one.

NURSE

(trying to be diplomatic)

Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't

want one like

that

one.

MARIA

(irate)

You don't know what it will be!

NURSE

(calling out to Maria as she disappears

out of the door)

The child won't thank you!

JEROME (VO)

Those were early days--days when a priest

could still persuade someone to put their

faith in God's hands rather than those of

the local geneticist.

ANTONIO

What's wrong?

JEROME (VO)

Of course, there was nothing wrong with me.

Not so long ago I would have been considered

a perfectly healthy, normal baby.  Ten fingers,

ten toes.  That was all that used to matter.

But now my immediate well-being was not the

sole concern.

"NERVE CONDITION - PROBABILITY 60%", "MANIC DEPRESSION -

JEROME (VO)

My destiny was mapped out before me--

all my flaws, predispositions and

susceptibilities - most untreatable to

this day.  Only minutes old, the date and

cause of my death was already known.

"HEART DISORDER - 99% - EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL.".

.

NURSE

The name?

(typing details into birth certificate)

For the certificate.

MARIA

Antonio--

ANTONIO

(correcting her)

--No,

Vincent

Antonio.

MARIA

(hysterical)

Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let

you out of my sight.

JEROME (VO)

I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.  And from

an early age I came to think of myself as

others thought of me - chronically ill.

Every skinned knee and runny nose treated

as if it were life-threatening.

JEROME (VO)

And my parents soon realized that wherever

I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.

JEROME (VO)

They put off having any more children

until they could afford not to gamble -

to bring a child into the world in what

has become the "natural" way.

JEROME (VO)

It meant selling the beloved Buick.

VINCENT (VO)

My father got a good price.  After all,

the only accident he'd ever had in that

car was me.

GENETICIST

(to the nurse, without taking

his eyes from his binocular microscope)

Put up the dish.

GENETICIST

Your extracted eggs...

(noting the couple's names from

data along the edge of the screen)

...

Maria

, have been fertilized with...

Antonio's

sperm and we have performed an

analysis of the resulting pre-embryos.

After screening we're left with two healthy

boys and two healthy girls.  Naturally, no

critical pre-dispositions to any of the major

inheritable diseases.  All that remains is

to select the most compatible candidate.

GENETICIST

First, we may as well decide on gender.

Have you given it any thought?

MARIA

(referring to the toddler

on her knee)

We would like Vincent to have a brother...

you know, to play with.

GENETICIST

You've already specified blue eyes, dark

hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty

of eradicating any potentially prejudicial

conditions - premature baldness, myopia,

alcoholism and addictive susceptibility,

propensity for violence and obesity--

MARIA

(interrupting, anxious)

--We didn't want--

diseases

, yes.

ANTONIO

(more diplomatic)

We were wondering if we should leave some

things to chance.

GENETICIST

(reassuring)

You want to give your child the best possible

start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection

built-in already.  Your child doesn't need

any additional burdens.  And keep in mind,

this child is still you, simply the

best

of you.

You could conceive naturally a thousand times

and never get such a result.

ANTONIO

(squeezing Maria's hand)

He's right, Maria.  That's right.

GENETICIST

Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed

child?

ANTONIO

(blank)

Er, no...

GENETICIST

(explaining)

Some believe it is associated with creativity,

although there's no evidence.  Also for

sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

ANTONIO

(shrugs)

I like football.

GENETICIST

(injecting a note of levity)

I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going

to be at least a head taller than you.

Prepare for a crick in the neck in

sixteen years time.

GENETICIST

(scanning the data on the screen)

Anything I've forgotten?

MARIA

(hesitant about broaching the subject)

We want him--we were hoping he would get

married and have children.  We'd like

grandchildren.

GENETICIST

(conspiratorial smile)

I understand.  That's already been taken

care of.

(an afterthought)

Now you appreciate I can only work with

the raw material I have at my disposal but

for a little extra...I could also attempt to

insert sequences associated with enhanced

mathematical or musical ability.

MARIA

(suddenly enthused)

Antonio, the choir...

GENETICIST

(interjecting, covering himself)

I have to caution you it's not fool-proof.

With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.

ANTONIO

How much extra?

GENETICIST

It would be five thousand more.

ANTONIO

I'm sorry, there's no way we can.

GENETICIST

Don't worry.  You'll probably do just

as well singing to him in the womb.

(rising to end the appointment)

We can implant the most successful

pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

MARIA

What will happen to the others?

GENETICIST

(reassuring)

They are not babies, Maria, merely

"human possibilities".

GENETICIST

Smaller than a grain of sand.

"ANTON 11"

is

JEROME (VO)

That's how my brother, Anton, came into the

world - a son my father considered worthy

of his name.

"VINCENT 13"

.  Vincent runs from the room.

JEROME (VO)

By the time we were playing at blood

brothers I understood that there was something

very different flowing through my veins.

JEROME (VO)

And I'd need an awful lot more than

a drop if I was going to get anywhere.

JEROME (VO)

Our favorite game was "chicken".  When our

parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside

the flags, as far out as we dared.  It was about

who would get scared and turn back first.

JEROME (VO)

Of course, it was always me.  Anton was by far

the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.

JEROME (VO)

My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow

me from school to school.  When you're told

you're prone to learning disabilities, it's

sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody.

ANTON

How many astronauts are there, anyway?

ANTON

I bet

I

could be one.

VINCENT

You're standing on Venus.

JEROME (VO)

I was popular enough until it got around

that I wasn't a long-term proposition.

JEROME (VO)

Those who didn't know already could easily

find out for themselves.  It was certainly

no problem coaxing the information out of me.

JEROME (VO)

I didn't blame them.  You need to know if a

prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage

or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.

MOTHER

(trying to break it gently)

Vincent, you have to be realistic.  A

heart condition like yours--

VINCENT

--I don't care.  I'll take the risk.

MOTHER

It's not just

you

they have to be concerned

about.  Perhaps we could get you one of

those new pacemakers.  They're not perfect

but--

FATHER

(letting his frustration show)

For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand.

The only way you'll see the inside of a space

ship is if you're cleaning it!

JEROME (VO)

My father was right.  It didn't matter how

much I lied on my resumE, my real C.V. was

in my cells.  Why should anybody invest all

that money to train

me

, when there are a

thousand other applicants with a far cleaner

profile?  Of course, it's illegal to discriminate -

"genoism" it's called - but no one takes the

laws seriously.

JEROME (VO)

If you refuse to disclose, they can always

take a sample from a doorhandle...

JEROME (VO)

...or a handshake...

JEROME (VO)

...even the saliva off your application form.

JEROME (VO)

But for the most part we know who we are.

And if all else fails, a legal drug test

can just as easily become an illegal peek

at your future in the company.

JEROME (VO)

I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.  You

can't blame someone for winning the lottery.

ANTON

(cocky)

You sure you want to do this?

JEROME (VO)

It was the last time we swam together.

Out into the open sea, like always,

knowing each stroke towards the horizon

was one we had to make back to the

shore.  Like always, the unspoken contest.

ANTONIO

Vincent, you damn fool!  You could have killed

Anton with your ridiculous contest!  Why should

he risk his life to save yours?!  When are you

going to get it through your thick head--you

can't compete with your brother!  Why try?!

ANTON

Why didn't you say anything?

VINCENT

Why didn't

you?

(staring back at his father knowingly)

It's okay.  It's the way they want it.

JEROME (VO)

It confirmed everything in the minds of

my parents - that they had taken the right

course with my younger brother and the

wrong course with me.  It would have been so

much easier for everyone if

I

had slipped away

that day.  I decided to grant them that wish.

JEROME (VO)

Like many others in my situation, I moved

around a lot in the next few years, getting

work where I could.  I must have cleaned

half the toilets in the state.

CAESAR

When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't

clean it too well.

VINCENT

(confused)

What do you mean?

CAESAR

(glancing to the Gattaca workers)

You might get ideas.

VINCENT

But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier

for you to see me when I'm on the other

side of it.

OWNER

Where's Earl?

JEROME

He fell.  Lucky it was only the second floor.

JEROME (VO)

Of course the best test score in the world

wasn't going to get me in the front door

unless I had the blood test to go with it.

GERMAN

(offering his hand)

Vincent, I'm German--

(anticipating Vincent's response)

That's my name.

VINCENT

What do you think?

GERMAN

(shrugs)

I think I could do something

(glancing to the text book)

provided you know what you're doing

and you can meet the terms.

GERMAN

You got a photo of yourself?

CAESAR

(to Vincent)

I thought I told you not to get any ideas.

GERMAN

Vincent...Vincent...

VINCENT

(staring through his glasses)

German, is that you?

GERMAN

Vincent, come down.  I've found him.

JEROME (VO)

For the genetically superior, success

is easier to attain but is by no means

guaranteed.  After all, there is no gene

for fate.  And when, for one reason or

another, a member of the elite falls on

hard times, their genetic identity becomes

a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.

One man's loss is another man's gain.

GERMAN

(enthusiastically reading from data on

his portable screen as he walks)

He has the heart of an ox.  He could run

through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run.

Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

VINCENT

I hope he's not just a body.

GERMAN

No problem.  Before he dropped out he was

an honor student, the right majors--

VINCENT

How do I square the accident?

GERMAN

(still reading data from his

palm-top computer)

It happened in Australasia.  He checked

in yesterday.  No family complications, no

record he ever broke his neck.  As far as

anybody's concerned, he's still a walking,

talking, fully-productive member of society.

You just have to get him off the pipe and

fill in the last two years of his life.

(correcting himself)

Excuse me,

your

life.

VINCENT

(looking around for a likely

candidate but finding none)

Where is he?

GERMAN

(smiling confidently

What did I tell you?  Which one's the mirror?

VINCENT

(still not fully convinced)

That's the hair color in his profile?

"HAIR: BLONDE"

GERMAN

Yeah.

VINCENT

(touching his own dark strands)

I'd have to bleach my hair.

GERMAN

(irritated, impatient)

Why are you inventing problems?  You two

are a couple of goddam clones.  You look

so right together, I want to double my fee.

VINCENT

(a thought occurs, addressing the

paraplegic for the first time)

How tall are you?

EUGENE

(deadpan)

Four foot six.

VINCENT

Okay, how tall did you

used

to be?

EUGENE

(apathetic, still under the

influence of whatever he's been smoking)

Six one.

VINCENT

(to German, disappointed)

He's too tall.

GERMAN

(shrugs)

You can wear lifts.

VINCENT

Even with lifts I'm never that tall.

GERMAN

There's a way.

JEROME (VO)

I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued

a man who was already dead.

VINCENT

You okay, Jerome?

EUGENE

(ironically referring to

their mutual immobility)

Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?

VINCENT

What's wrong with it?

EUGENE

I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all,

you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning

how to be

you

.

VINCENT

(shrugs)

Suit yourself.

EUGENE

(trying to be more diplomatic)

Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful

--I know you and that little broker--what do you

call him?

VINCENT

German.

EUGENE

You're both going to a lot of trouble--

(trying to be tactful)

Maybe you can con somebody into believing

you're me to get your foot in the door--but

once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm

sure you're sincere...

(glancing to the space paraphenalia)

...but I was being groomed for something like

this myself.  Even without the accident I don't

think I would have made it.  My point is--how the

hell do

you

expect to pull this off?

VINCENT

(shrugs and states it simply)

I don't know exactly, Jerome.

EUGENE

(laughing)

At least you're honest.

(a thought occurs)

Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're

going to be Jerome, you may as well start

getting used to it.

JEROME

(guiltily closing the book)

I have to know where you come from.

EUGENE

If anybody asks, tell them the truth--

your family disowns you.  You are a

disappointment, Jerome.

JEROME

(referring to Eugene's medal, impressed)

What about this?

EUGENE

Wrong color.  It's silver.

(tossing the bag of blood to Jerome)

It's not easy living up to this.

EUGENE

(wheeling by, looking over Jerome's

shoulder at the signature)

It needs work.

JEROME

(rueful)

You had to be a right-hander.

EUGENE

Noone orders southpaws anymore.

JEROME (VO)

Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest

and most justifiable of the quality-of-life

corrections.  Anybody with impaired vision is

certain to be suffering from all the other

deficiencies of a "nonadvantaged" birth.

GERMAN

(inspecting the lens in Jerome's eye)

It's no good.  I can see an edge.  He may as

well walk in there with a cane.

EUGENE

(still grimacing, referring to the follicles)

You really need that much?

JEROME

More

than that.  You'll get used to it.

EUGENE

(yanking out another hair)

God, what

wouldn't

you do to leave the planet?

JEROME

(inspecting a hair follicle)

Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in

this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star.

I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

EUGENE

(marvelling at Jerome's earnestness)

God, you're serious, aren't you?

JEROME

It's not too late to back out.

EUGENE

You don't know what a relief it is not to

be me.  Are you sure

you

want the job?

JEROME

What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?

EUGENE

(referring to the bladder bag he wears)

Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may

as well pay my rent.

TECHNICIAN

(reading off the profile)

Congratulations.

JEROME

(perplexed)

What about the interview?

TECHNICIAN

(referring to the cup)

That was it.

JEROME (VO)

The majority of people are now made-to-order.

What began as a means to rid society of

inheritable diseases has become a way to design

your offspring--the line between health and

enhancement blurred forever.  Eyes can always be

brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body

stronger, a life longer.  Everyone seeks to give

their child the best chance but the most skilled

geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.

JEROME (VO)

Anyone who is the product of an altered

DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN",

"self-made man or woman", "man-child".

JEROME (VO)

Those parents who, for moral or, more likely

economic reasons, refrain from tampering with

their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail

to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children

to a life of routine discrimination.

JEROME (VO)

Officially they are called "In-Valids"*.  Also

known as "godchildren", "men-of-god", "faith births",

"blackjack births", "deficients", "defectives",

"genojunk", "ge-gnomes", "the fucked-up people".

JEROME (VO)

They are the "healthy ill".  They don't

actually have anything yet - they may never.

But since few of the pre-conditions can be

cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them

as if they were already sick.

JEROME (VO)

By means of a donor I have cheated the

system for the last four years to open doors

that would otherwise be closed to me.

JEROME (VO)

In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen

quickly through the ranks of Gattaca.  Only one

of the Mission Directors has ever come close

to discovering my true identity.

JEROME (VO)

Strange to think, he may have more success

exposing me in death than he did in life.

EMPLOYEE 1

(staring at the Director's body)

Awful.

EMPLOYEE 2

Yeah, awful it didn't happen

sooner

.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

You're lucky to be getting out of this.

JEROME

We're still going ahead as planned?

DIRECTOR JOSEF

The launch window is only open until week's

end.  Tragic though this event may be, it

hasn't stopped the planets turning.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

You'll have to excuse me, Jerome.  I have to

meet with the authorities--naturally, we're

co-operating in any way, although I won't

tolerate a major disruption.

(as he departs)

I wish I was going with you, Jerome.

ANNOUNCER (OC)

Thank you for your co-operation.  Please

return to your work stations immediately.

EMPLOYEE 3

(sarcastic aside)

What, no counselling?

IRENE

Excuse me, Jerome.  I'm sorry to bother you.

JEROME

No bother.

IRENE

(referring to her notepad)

I've been asked to compile a log for the

investigators--they want to know everyone's

whereabouts last night.

JEROME

Last night?  I was at home.

IRENE

Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?

JEROME

No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.

JEROME

(wry smile)

Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about

you?

Where were you last night?

IRENE

I was at home.

JEROME

Were

you

alone?

IRENE

(hesitant)

Yes.

JEROME

(teasing)

So we don't know for sure about you, either.

IRENE

(wary, wondering where the

conversation is headed)

No.

JEROME

Why don't we say we were together?

IRENE

(confused)

Why would we do that?

JEROME

I have better things to do this week than

answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot.

Don't you?

JEROME

(gently pressing)

Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?

IRENE

To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know

what that was like.

EUGENE

You didn't forget the truffles?

EUGENE

(sensing something amiss, trying

to keep his humor)

Who died?

JEROME

The Mission Director.

EUGENE

(misinterpreting the deadpan remark)

You wish.

JEROME

They found him in his office this morning--

beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.

EUGENE

What an act of benevolence--a service to the

community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing

between you and ignition.

JEROME

He was still warm when they confirmed.

EUGENE

(confused by Jerome's attitude)

This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?

JEROME

The place is crawling with Hoovers.

EUGENE

So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?

JEROME

That's not the point.

EUGENE

(scoffing)

Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the

"J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--

(glancing up to the night sky)

you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.

(gently chiding)

Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.

JEROME

(still tempering Eugene's enthusiasm)

You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got

my final physical tomorrow.

TECHNICIAN

How old?

YOUNG WOMAN

(confused)

Me?

TECHNICIAN

(mustering patience, referring

to the Q-tip)

The

specimen

.

YOUUNG WOMAN

(proudly)

I kissed him five minutes ago.  A real good one.

TECHNICIAN

(long-suffering)

I'll see what I can do.

TECHNICIAN

(remarking on the profile result)

9.4...very nice.

MICHAEL

Good evening, gentlemen.  Your table is ready.

(referring to Jerome's mission)

Not long now, sir.  You'll be upstairs

before you know it.  We're going to miss you.

JEROME

Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff.

I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.

WAITRESS

(aghast at the sight of his lifeless legs)

I'm so sorry.  Did I hurt you?

EUGENE

(smiling, a trace of bitterness)

Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured.

EUGENE

You want to meet a real-life spaceman?

JEROME

Let's get out of here.

EUGENE

(knocking back his drink,

misinterpreting the hasty departure)

You're right, there's more atmosphere

where you're going.

JEROME

You drive.

EUGENE

(screaming in both fear and exhilaration)

I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!

JEROME

Keep going!!  Keep going!!

EUGENE

(gently chiding Jerome over the joyride)

You idiot.  You could ruin everything

with a stunt like that.

EUGENE

(gazing up into the night sky)

At least up there your piss will be worth something.

(smiling at the thought)

You'll all be showering in it, right?

JEROME

(zipping his fly)

And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the

time it's filtered.

EUGENE

(referring to the rocket ship)

What

is

that one?

JEROME

(looking at his watch)

11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.

EUGENE

How long do you stay up there before you go?

JEROME

A day or so.

EUGENE

(beaming)

I still can't believe they're sending you to

the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be

born, on a mission to discover the origin

of life.

JEROME

You should be going instead of me.

JEROME

Up there they wouldn't be a problem.

EUGENE

(glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)

You know I'm scared of heights.

INVESTIGATOR

(to the tongue, as he inserts the

tip of the swab into an analyzer)

Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.

ASSISTANT

The tongue is male.  Mature.  Blonse hair.

Brown eyes.  Light complexion.  Between

5'11 and 6'1.  Pronounced Caucasian nose.

Thin lips.  Weak chin.  Lobeless ears.

Prematurely balding.  Slightly bow-legged.

Broad shoulders.  Barrel chest...

(pause)

Blind.

INVESTIGATOR

(interest piqued)

Blind?

(mildly amused, checking the

monitor for himself)

The tongue is

blind?

ASSISTANT

(confused)

Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?

INVESTIGATOR

(shrugs)

Someone who is mindful that the blind

still speak.

TRACKING IN-VALID

EUGENE

(sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit)

I'm sorry.  Did you want it?

EUGENE

Let me get it for you.

EUGENE

(maudlin, sobbing like a child)

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

JEROME

(attempting to comfort)

It's okay, Eugene.

EUGENE

You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was

doing when I walked in front of that car--

JEROME

--What car?--Go to sleep.

EUGENE

--I walked right in front of it.  I was never

more sober in my life.

JEROME

It's all right.

EUGENE

(grabbing Jerome by the collar)

I'm proud of you, Vincent.

JEROME

(smiling to himself)

You must be drunk to call me Vincent.

DETECTIVE HUGO

I don't understand why you were dragged out

here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your

time--a no-nothing case like this.

INVESTIGATOR

(gently rebuking his subordinate)

A man's dead, Detective.

DETECTIVE HUGO

Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log,

alibis, grudges...

INVESTIGATOR

Grudges?

DETECTIVE HUGO

(looking out over the balcony)

I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes.

The Director was not...

(searching for the words)

...universally loved.  He was leading the

cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at

a room full of motives.

INVESTIGATOR

(shaking his head adamantly,

referring to the bag in his hand)

No,

this

is your man.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(not so convinced)

With respect, Sir--it may be the only

unaccountable specimen but the profile

suggests--

INVESTIGATOR

--What

about

his profile?

DETECTIVE HUGO

According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital

heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen

has been here but there's an 80 percent chance

the owner of that eyelash has already died

himself from natural causes.

INVESTIGATOR

(terse)

So there's a 20 percent chance he's

not

dead.

DETECTIVE HUGO

Even if this Vincent Luca

is

alive, is it

likely he could bludgeon a man to death?

INVESTIGATOR

No.  Not

likely

.

DETECTIVE HUGO

I take it you're thinking along the lines of a

robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?

DETECTIVE HUGO

(skeptical)

Of course that doesn't jibe with what we

found.  This was an angry killing.

INVESTIGATOR

(glancing to the profile in Hugo's hand)

Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile

indicates a proclivity for violence.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(trying to appear co-operative)

I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for

any family or associate connections--

INVESTIGATOR

--I've already run it.  There's no record

of any living relative.

DETECTIVE HUGO

What a pity.

INVESTIGATOR

(irritated, glancing to the sample bag)

Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and

found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's

minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.

MEDICAL DIRECTOR

Napoleon, you're late for your substance test.

JEROME

Director, Napoleon's helping me today.

MEDICAL DIRECTOR

Well, you take it

for

him, Jerome.

NAPOLEON

Why did you do that?

JEROME

(exiting to the testing lab)

Don't worry about it.

TRAINER

You're excused, Irene.  You may resume your duties.

LAMAR

(marveling at Jerome's heartrate)

Six miles later it's still beating like a

Goddamn metronome.  I could play piano by that

heartbeat of his.

DETECTIVE HUGO

Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator.

INVESTIGATOR

How often do you test, Director?

DIRECTOR JOSEF

Often.

INVESTIGATOR

(intrigued)

Surely you know what you have.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we

can hardly turn the boat around.

LAMAR

(still marveling at Jerome)

I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd

still be there.

INVESTIGATOR

We believe we have a suspect.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

What a relief.

INVESTIGATOR

(referring to the profile of VINCENT

on Hugo's computer notepad)

This unaccountable specimen was found in

the south wing corridor.

DETECTIVE HUGO

An age enhancement is being prepared as

we speak.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

(referring to his assistant)

Irene will make it available to security.

CAESAR

I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.

JEROME

(eyes fixed on the view)

We were looking at each other.  You stopped.

IRENE

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.

JEROME

(shrugging as if it makes

no difference to him)

We were just looking.

IRENE

I know about you.

IRENE

(offering the hair to Jerome)

Here, take it.

IRENE

(a challenge)

If you're still interested, let me know.

JEROME

(never taking his eyes from her)

Sorry, the wind caught it.

JEROME

(as if making conversation)

Have they found our friend?

IRENE

Friend?

JEROME

(shrugs)

It was a mercy-killing after all.

IRENE

They found an eyelash.

JEROME

Where?

IRENE

In the South Wing.

JEROME

Does it have a name?

IRENE

Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--

(trying to come up with the last name)

--somebody.

JEROME

Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.

IRENE

(a smile playing around her lips)

You celebrate, Jerome?

EUGENE

(into phone)

--I know what I ordered.  I ordered "Honey

Dawn" and you sent me "Summer Wheat".

JEROME (OC)

Call German.

EUGENE

Any particular reason?

JEROME

(collecting up sample bags from

the work bench)

We can't stay here.

EUGENE

What are you talking about?

JEROME

They think I offed the Director.

EUGENE

What makes them think that?

JEROME

They found my eyelash.

EUGENE

(a flicker of anxiety)

Where?

JEROME

In a corridor.

EUGENE

(blasE once again)

Could be worse.  They could have found

it in your eye.

JEROME

(resuming his collection of samples)

Come on--we're taking off.

EUGENE

I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go.

Not on your life--

JEROME

--You don't understand, they'll make the

connection, they'll hoover again.  We should

cut our losses.

EUGENE

(angrily grabbing a tray from Jerome's hands)

Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting

like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash

to you.  They won't believe that one of their

elite navigators could have suckered them for the

last five years.

JEROME

They'll recognize me.

EUGENE

(scoffing)

How could they recognize you?

(referring to the torn photo of

20-year-old Vincent on the wall)

I

don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a

choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession,

turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out--

find out what we can but change nothing.  This is

a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken

worse heat than this.

(angry now)

Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go

belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I

wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me

now.  I've put too much into this.

(returning the samples to the fridge)

Besides, this stuff is

mine

.  I had other offers,

you know.  I could have rented myself out to

somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in

there and finish the job myself?

(meeting Jerome's gaze)

We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like

we planned.

EUGENE

And keep your lashes on your lids where

they belong.  How could you be so careless?

JEROME

I'm sorry.

(reluctant admission)

I think I was crying.

EUGENE

Well save those tears.

JEROME

You really had other offers?

EUGENE

(shrugs)

I'm sure I could have.

JEROME

Mind if I borrow a tie?

EUGENE

So it's not just the Hoovers who've got

you rattled.

JEROME

You're the one who said not to change anything.

She's my ear to the investigation.

EUGENE

(skeptical)

Is that all?

JEROME

I've got enough on my mind without that.

EUGENE

If you say so.

(referring to the ties in Jerome's hand)

The stripe.

JEROME

(agreeing with the selection)

Good choice.

JEROME

Not thirsty?

(referring to the fridge)

We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.

EUGENE

I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still

drunk from last night.

JEROME

Never stopped you before.

(regarding Eugene's head)

And for God's sake stop plucking your hair.

Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure

you wouldn't go bald.

EUGENE

If I were you I'd worry about myself.

(nodding to Jerome's spectacles)

Haven't you forgotten something?

GERMAN

We still need to overhaul the back-up generator.

(fixing Eugene with a penetrating stare)

What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going

away, not you--you going on vacation?

EUGENE

(looking away)

You got it, German.

GERMAN

(nodding thoughtfully)

You deserve it.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(enthusiastic)

Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.

DETECTIVE HUGO

This is the age enhancement we're working with.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(referring to the line-up)

As you requested, we've kept the parameters

wider than usual.

INVESTIGATOR

We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.

DETECTIVE HUGO

This

is

the most likely location--

INVESTIGATOR

--There's that word again.  I have a feeling

This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not

exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely"

that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for

fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come

to us now like a lamb?

DETECTIVE HUGO

(taken aback by the outburst)

Is there something more we should know about this

suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.

INVESTIGATOR

Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid

have shown up at the scene of four serious

felonies.  Do you need any more than that?

DETECTIVE HUGO

With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent

citizens have left specimens at as many crime

scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.

INVESTIGATOR

I don't like anybody

this

unlucky.

(pause)

Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile

radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier

establishments.  Random car stops.

DETECTIVE HUGO

We're already getting complaints about

frivolous search.

INVESTIGATOR

This is a murder investigation.  The public

should be happy to co-operate, to get this

disease off the streets.

IRENE

(catching his look of astonishment)

You didn't know?

JEROME

(trying hard to convince)

Yes...

yes

...

IRENE

(picking up a resentment, confused)

You're angry--

JEROME

Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.

JOHN

Shit!  One of those Hoovers is back.

VALERIE

It's alright.  He's here to see me.

VALERIE

(to an unseen woman in the next room)

Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight.

VALERIE

I don't understand you, Investigator.

VALERIE

(teasing good-naturedly)

You hunt us by day and fuck us by night.  Do

you only get it up for In-valids?

VALERIE

Wouldn't you be happier with one of your

made-to-order whores?

INVESTIGATOR

(gently stroking her hair)

You are so beautiful, are you sure you

weren't

altered?  This is not the face, the body, of

a Godchild.  How could something so lovely

be a product of chance?

VALERIE

Is that what keeps you coming back?

(meeting his gaze)

Look at you.  Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes.

Do you ever wonder what they would see if they

weren't quite so perfect?  They will never see

what

I

see.

INVESTIGATOR

(a cruel edge to his voice)

You have so much wrong with you, you'll

be lucky to see next year.

VALERIE

Are you so much more alive, Investigator?

INVESTIGATOR

(parting her legs)

I'm not paying you to talk.

JEROME

(conspiratorial)

Better not.

(nodding in Irene's direction)

Don't want to give you a contaminated

specimen...if you get my meaning.

JEROME

Thanks.

(answering her unasked question)

You never know where those swabs have been.

IRENE

I want to show you something.

IRENE

(calling back urgently from the

other side, mindful of the light

beginning to leak into the sky)

Come on!  We'll miss it!

JEROME

Come on.  We'll miss it.

IRENE

What did I tell you?

IRENE

I envy you, Jerome.

JEROME

You'll be next.

IRENE

I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make

in space is around the sun--

(letting a handful of sand

slip through her fingers)

--on this satellite right here.

IRENE

(blurting out what's really on her mind)

--Listen, I don't want to waste your time

and I

really

don't want you to waste

mine

.

I don't know what you're after but I have

a feeling I'm not it.

IRENE

(enjoying his unease)

It's here.  My heart.

(adding quickly)

I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a

drug maintenance program, blood thinners,

diet--

(slowly removing his hand)

I just want you to know what you'd be getting

yourself into.

JEROME

What exactly is wrong?

IRENE

Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing

symptoms in my late-fifties.

(matter-of-fact)

But unless they come up with something between

now and then, I won't live much past 67.

IRENE

Of course I think about it every day.

JEROME

(still not quite recovered from his surprise)

Of course.

EUGENE

How was your evening?

JEROME

Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.

EUGENE

(teasing)

You

are

a catch.  No doubt she's worried that

she would lower the standard of your offspring.

Everybody wants to "breed up".

(idly curious)

What's wrong with her?

JEROME

(trying to be blasE)

You know how it is with these altered births

--somebody told her she's not going to live

forever and she's been preparing to die ever

since.

EUGENE

You're not thinking of telling her, are you?

JEROME

Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.

EUGENE

(adamant)

She doesn't

have

to know.  She doesn't

want

to know.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(chagrined)

The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant.

The employees are all accounted for.

INVESTIGATOR

A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?

DETECTIVE HUGO

(shifting the view of the map

to include the Gattaca complex)

No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have

shown up there in the past.

DETECTIVE HUGO

We have to consider the possibility that he's

playing somebody else's hand.

INVESTIGATOR

(taking a perverse pleasure in the

slowly dawning revelation)

Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".

(glancing to a photo of the

Gattaca crime scene)

He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find

the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to

take a leak during a murder.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(quickly covering himself)

It's still possible the eyelash specimen came

from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown

in through an open window.

INVESTIGATOR

(mind racing)

He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(puzzled)

It is hard to believe he could be one of

their elite workers.  You've seen their

security system.  They know who works there.

(referring to 20-year-old Vincent's profile)

Even if you ignore the man's expiration date,

his profile suggests that he doesn't have the

mathematical propensity let alone the stamina

to pass their physicals.

INVESTIGATOR

Don't underestimate these imposters.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(skeptical, referring to a file of

Gattaca employee ID photos)

None of the ID photos match the enhancement.

INVESTIGATOR

(smiling to himself)

A man can change his face--but blood is forever.

Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.

(pause)

Intravenous.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(immediately protesting)

You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at

least fall into the category.  We'll be

closing down their operation for days.

(seeking a compromise)

At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.

INVESTIGATOR

(shaking his head)

Blood.  From the vein.

CAESAR

Look like anybody to you?

YOUNGER JANITOR

Not to me.

CAESAR

Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?

DIRECTOR JOSEF

--Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key.

(warming to his theme)

Back to the beginning of the book--the life we

became.  With the original building blocks who

knows how far we can take "the godding".

MISSION COMMANDER

(wry smile)

Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be

last year's model by the time we're done.

JEROME

(smiling back)

I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander.

IRENE

Excuse me, Mr Morrow.  The investigators have

begun their testing.

DETECTIVE JOSEF

This is so inconvenient, Irene.  They can

make an exception for Jerome.

IRENE

I'm afraid not.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

I apologize, Jerome.

JEROME

It's not yor fault, Director.

(afterthought)

If your predecessor were still around

we may not be going to Gaspra at all.

That's what

I

would call inconvenient.

JEROME

(referring to the table lined with syringes)

What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are

you doing, opening a blood bank?

LAMAR

(sarcastic)

The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that

my testing methods may have been compromised.

JEROME

Damn!!

LAMAR

(grabbing a nearby wad of gauze)

Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome.

JEROME

(unfazed, putting Lamar at his ease)

You must be out of practise, Lamar.

LAMAR

(examining and removing the

switched vial from the bent syringe)

I've got enough here.

JEROME

(regarding the squimish detective,

as he holds the gauze to his arm)

Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

"VALID"

.  Another

IRENE

So you didn't do it after all.

JEROME

(joking darkly)

I guess somebody beat me to it.

DETECTIVE HUGO

That's the last.

INVESTIGATOR

Something's not right.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(losing his patience)

He's not here.  It's a blind alley.

INVESTIGATOR

(resolute)

No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.

DETECTIVE HUGO

We don't have the manpower.

INVESTIGATOR

Get it.  From outside, if you have to.

DETECTIVE HUGO

From what budget?

INVESTIGATOR

(angered by Hugo's excuses)

I'll take it out of your damn

pension

if

you question my authority one more time!

DIRECTOR JOSEF

Would you care to look--in the telescope?

INVESTIGATOR

Thank you, no.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

(still referring to the telescope)

One look through there and you would know why

I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations

any further.

INVESTIGATOR

(unfazed)

You're so unconcerned that you have a killer

in your midst.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

Right now,

your

presence is creating more of

a threat.  I don't think you have any concept

of what we do here--how meticulous our

preparations must be.  We are about to send

twelve people through 140 million miles of

blackness to rendezvous with an object the size

of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather

critical to point them in the right direction.

And we certainly don't need you looking over our

shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is

any evidence that the killer

is

amongst us.  I

don't see too many other dead bodies littering

the place.

INVESTIGATOR

(surveying the mostly empty facility)

No, but since there aren't too many

live

ones

tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one

further sweep.  If he does not work here, then

there should be no other trace of him.

(to Hugo)

I think you'd better get some people out of bed,

Detective.

(a thought occurs)

In the meantime we can re-check his favorite

haunt.

INVESTIGATOR

(to Josef, referring to the telescope)

You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.

EUGENE

Where are we going?

JEROME

(slightly guilty)

I'm sorry.  I've got plans.

EUGENE

(feigning hurt)

Again?

JEROME

(referring to his bandage)

She's already got her doubts.  I have to act

like nothing's wrong.

EUGENE

I'm sure you'll be very convincing.

EUGENE

Where are you taking her?

JEROME

Michael's.

JEROME

Everybody goes there.

EUGENE

(incredulous, glancing around the room)

You may as well invite her here.

JEROME

(afterthought as he picks up his jacket)

Will you be okay?

EUGENE

Don't worry about your little pin cushion.

To be honest, I'm looking forward to having

the place to myself.

JEROME

(seeing through the bravado)

We'll still be able to talk when I'm away.

The conversation will just keep getting longer.

EUGENE

How long?

JEROME

By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and

say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes

later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"

EUGENE

I guess I'd better have something important

to say if it takes that long to get an answer.

IRENE

What

is

this place?

JEROME

(wry smile, enjoying her fascination)

You've never been here?

(a dessert trolley is wheeled up)

Let me order for you.

IRENE

I'd better not.

JEROME

So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even

know what it tastes like, Irene?

MICHAEL

Take the side door.

DETECTIVE

(to his colleagues)

Check for lenses, hairpieces--

IRENE

Why are we leaving?

JEROME

(attempting to explain the hasty exit)

Those checks take forever.

IRENE

(stunned)

Jerome!

IRENE

What about the car?

JEROME

(grabbing her by the hand)

Let's walk.

IRENE

Who are they?

JEROME

(holding his bruised knuckles)

It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.

IRENE

I can't.

JEROME

(anxious)

Come on.

IRENE

My medication.  I left it back there.

JEROME

We'll get it later.

(forcing her to look him in the eye)

Irene, please.

INVESTIGATOR

(an accusing tone)

You run a clean establishment.

MICHAEL

Are you a health inspector?

INVESTIGATOR

(showing Vincent's mugshot)

Do you recognize this man?

MICHAEL

My eyes aren't so good.

INVESTIGATOR

I bet.

HUGO

Sir.

INVESTIGATOR

(to the still dazed Detective,

examining his injuries)

Did he hit you with his fist?

DETECTIVE

(head in his hands)

More like a hammer.

INVESTIGATOR

(reprimanding the beaten Detective)

Don't touch your face.  Don't swallow.

Don't spit.

(to Hugo)

Quick, clean his teeth.

IRENE

(upset, a strangled protest)

Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?!

Don't you understand, I can't do that!

JEROME

You just did.

INVESTIGATOR (OC)

Vincent!  Vincent!

INVESTIGATOR

(to Hugo, covering his frustration)

What are you waiting for?

DETECTIVE HUGO

Where do we start?

INVESTIGATOR

We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.

DETECTIVE

(handing the Investigator Irene's pill box)

We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.

IRENE

So sure of what you can't do.

IRENE

(referring to the shins)

What happened?

JEROME

You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

It's the exact height of the front fender.

(shrugs)

Looked right instead of left.

IRENE

(comforted by the thought)

So you're not so smart after all.

(awkward about raising the subject)

I want you to know--if it ever came to it--

I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg

Bank.  In fact, I'd

rather

use a donor egg--

(quickly covering herself again)

--

if

it came to it.

JEROME

But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--

(searching for an appropriate body part)

--nose.

(stroking her face)

How perfect does your child have to be?

IRENE

(mildly irritated by what she

perceives as his mocking)

You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment

you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't

for who you are--

what

you are?  Don't you get

any

satisfaction knowing that your children

will be able to live to a ripe old age unless

they do something foolish?

JEROME

That's precisely what

scares

me--that they

won't do anything

foolish

or

courageous

or

anything

--worth a Goddamn.

HUGO

(reading newspaper)

My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.

INVESTIGATOR

(shrugs, ambivalent)

Why not?

HUGO

These new personality corrections I've been

reading about.

INVESTIGATOR

You worried about the cost?

HUGO

Not that.

INVESTIGATOR

(regarding Hugo with a condescending smile)

They said the same thing about myopia and

obesity.  You think your children would be

less human if they were less violent, angry,

spiteful?  Maybe they'd be

more

human.  From

where I sit the world could stand a little

improving.

DETECTIVE

Don't touch that.  It's evidence.

DETECTIVE HUGO

Positive saliva match.  The cup was

definitely used since the original sweep.

INVESTIGATOR

So we have two choices.  Either our suspect

came back to the murder scene for a drink of

water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...

(looking out over the empty complex)

...he

is

here.

(resolute)

We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a

desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that

night--perhaps their place in line.

(to Director Josef)

I'd like the profiles of everyone with an

upcoming mission.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

(nervous)

Twelve have a mission within the week.

INVESTIGATOR

This time I will supervise each test personally.

IRENE

What is it?

JEROME

I forgot something--something at home.

I'll see you later.

IRENE

I'll miss you.

IRENE

(looking skywards)

--when you go away.

JEROME

We could go together one day.

DETECTIVE HUGO

He's the only absentee.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

A little nausea.  Quite common.

INVESTIGATOR

At least it's nothing contagious.

DIRECTOR JOSEF

(unduly agitated)

I will not permit any further testing on the

eve of a mission.  We're already counting

backwards.

IRENE

(picking up a phone)

I'll call and let him know.

INVESTIGATOR

Let's not spoil the surprise.

(to Irene)

I understand you can show us the way.

EUGENE

Hello?

JEROME (OC)

How would you like to be yourself for the day?

EUGENE

(nonchalant)

I was never very good at it, remember?

INVESTIGATOR

(taunting)

You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?

INVESTIGATOR

You think you have problems?

EUGENE (OC)

(through intercom, no trace of his distress)

Hello.

IRENE

(a moment's hesitation)

Jerome--?

EUGENE

Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.

EUGENE

Where's my kiss?

IRENE

Good to see you're feeling better.

EUGENE

Now

you're

here.  Who are your "friends"?

IRENE

It's about the Director.

EUGENE

(feigning boredom)

Again?

EUGENE

Forgive me for not getting up.

IRENE

(to the Investigator)

Couldn't we do this another time?

INVESTIGATOR

I don't believe so.

DETECTIVE HUGO

This won't take a moment.

EUGENE

(reassuring to Irene, referring to

the blood flowing into the syringe)

It's okay.  Maybe they can find out what I've got.

INVESTIGATOR

Mind if I take a leak?

EUGENE

As long as you don't do it in my closet.

(nodding to the other side of the room)

Over there.

INVESTIGATOR

(to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)

May I?

EUGENE

Clean the whole house if you want.

IRENE

(taking Eugene's lead)

Actually, the kitchen needs doing.

DETECTIVE HUGO (OC)

(into phone, increasingly encouraged)

Yes?...Yes...

yes

...

DETECTIVE

(urgent, to Investigator)

Come quickly.  We

have

him.

JEROME

(numb)

How are you, Jerome?

EUGENE

Not bad, Jerome.

JEROME

How the hell did you get here.

EUGENE

(deadpan)

I could always walk.  I've been faking it.

JEROME

(calling after her)

Irene.

INVESTIGATOR

(gazing at the Director, struggling

to come to grips with the turn of events)

This can't be him.

DETECTIVE HUGO

(intrigued)

We found his spit in the dead director's eye.

He's signed a confession--supplied us with the

suit he wore on the night.  What more do you

want?

INVESTIGATOR

(a trace of desperation, grasping at straws)

Luca could still be an accomplice.

MISSION COMMANDER

--Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow

on his debut mission--if we get lost out there,

nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like

Jerome.

MISSION COMMANDER

(adopting a more serious tone)

I'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud

hanging over tomorrow's launch.  Now we can put

this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate

on the task at hand.  I don't have to tell you how

important this mission is--the Belt could hold

the key to the origin of life - why we are what

we are.

(injecting a note of levity)

I know many of you have been asking that

question about

me

for long enough.

(referring to a projected photograph

of a misshapen asteroid behind his head)

Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so

many beautiful secrets?

MISSION COMMANDER

Enjoy your final evening with your families.

We'll all be a year older when they see

us next.  And don't be late tomorrow.  You

don't want to miss this.

INVESTIGATOR

(excited)

Hugo!  I've found him!

HUGO

I've found him too.

INVESTIGATOR

(not listening, referring to his discovery)

A fingerprint.  There's something to be

said for nostalgia.

(realizing what Hugo has said)

What did you find?

DETECTIVE HUGO

It's not

exactly

him.

INVESTIGATOR

(interest piqued)

Where did you get this?

DETECTIVE HUGO

(referring to the tissue)

But this man does share some common

characteristics with your suspect.  Not so

many but

enough

.  It appears the eyelash

has a brother--of a kind.

CAESAR

So you've finally seen sense and come back

to your old job, Vincent.

JEROME

Not yet, I'm afraid.

CAESAR

No?  What's keeping you?

JEROME

I guess I'm a slow learner.

CAESAR

I guess so.

(looking up through the

small window)

Well, while you're up there, maybe you could

tidy the place up a bit.

JEROME

I'll see what I can do.

CAESAR

And don't go getting everybody lost out there.

You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have

me to keep an eye on you, you know.

JEROME

(glancing to Caesar's locker)

By the way, I left some trash in your locker.

CAESAR

(happy to oblige)

I'll take care of it.

INVESTIGATOR

Vincent--

INVESTIGATOR

Vincent, what are you running from?

JEROME

(disturbingly calm)

From Vincent.

INVESTIGATOR

Has it been so long, you don't remember

who I am?

JEROME

(nodding to the Investigator's badge)

Maybe it's

you

who's forgotten.

(meeting his gaze)

What are you doing here, Anton?

ANTON

I could ask

you

the same question.

(glancing to the impressive complex)

I have a

right

to be here,

you

don't.

JEROME

You almost sound like you believe that.

ANTON

(ignoring the remark, extending his hand)

Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far

as you can go.

JEROME

(refusing Anton's hand, glancing

to the telescope above them)

There are a few million miles to go yet.

ANTON

(adamant)

It's over.

JEROME

(shaking his head)

Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton,

to see me fail?

ANTON

It's for the best.

JEROME

(increasingly angered)

God, even

you

want to tell me what I

can't

do.

In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't

need rescuing.  But

you

did, once.

JEROME

(goading)

Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that

possible?

ANTON

(resolute)

You didn't beat me that day.  I beat

myself

.

JEROME

Who are you trying to convince?

ANTON

(angry)

I will prove it to you.  Come swim with

me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.

IRENE

Hello.

EUGENE (OC)

Quite something, isn't it?

EUGENE

(referring to the incinerator)

That's where we get rid of the traces of him

although we never truly succeeded.

IRENE

I've been looking for him.  Do you know where

he is?

EUGENE

(unconcerned)

He's probably leaving some more of me

around the place before he goes.

EUGENE

Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are

just the clothes.  He has to wear them.

Something I could never do.

IRENE

What's wrong with him?

EUGENE

(sympathetic smile)

You have more in common than you know.

EUGENE

But they say

his

is already ten thousand beats

overdue.  I have my doubts.

(wry smile)

For all my gifts, they could never engineer

me a heart like Vincent's.

ANTON

(attempting to conceal his distress)

How are you doing this, Vincent?  How

have you done

any

of this?

JEROME

Now is your chance to find out.

ANTON

(panic starting to show)

Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out.

We have to go back!

JEROME

(calling back)

Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.

ANTON

What

other side?  How far do you want to

go?!

Do you want to drown us both?

(becoming hysterical)

How are we going to get

back?!

JEROME

(eerily calm)

You wanted to know how I did it.  That's

how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything

for the swim back.

JEROME

(wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)

Here, take it.

JEROME

(echoing Irene's words from

their first encounter)

If you're still interested, let me know.

IRENE

(never taking her eyes from him, echoing

Jerome's words from their first encounter)

Sorry, the wind caught it.

JEROME

(awakening)

A year is a long time.

IRENE

Not so long--just once around the sun.

EUGENE

I have your samples ready.

JEROME

(confused)

Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples

where I'm going.

EUGENE

(meeting Jerome's gaze)

No, but you might need them when you get back.

EUGENE

Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.

EUGENE

There's an extra specimen.  I wish I

could give it to her myself.

(afterthought)

But then, you always were better at being me.

JEROME

(struggling to come to terms

with the discovery)

Why have you done this?

EUGENE

(as he seals the mirrored door)

In case you get back before I do.

JEROME

Where are you going?

EUGENE

(glancing to the suitcases)

I'm travelling too.

JEROME

Thank you.

EUGENE

I got the better end of the deal.  I just

lent you my body--you lent me your dream.

EUGENE

(referring to the note,

glancing heavenwards)

Not until you're upstairs.

JEROME

(as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar)

What's this, Lamar?

LAMAR

New policy.

LAMAR

(intrigued by the

out-of-character discharge)

Flight got you nervous?

JEROME

There's a problem, Lamar.

LAMAR

(apparently not listening)

Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's

a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.

JEROME

(as he urinates)

Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up

and back and nobody would have been the wiser--

LAMAR

(cutting him off)

--Unfortunately my son's not all that they

promised.  But then, who know what he could do.

LAMAR

For future reference--

(a brief glance to where

Jerome has just zipped his fly)

--righthanded men don't hold it with their

left.  It's just one of those things.

LAMAR

(knowing smile)

Have a safe trip, Vincent.

JEROME (VO)

We came from the stars so they say, now

it's time to go back.  If I was conceived

today, I would not get beyond eight cells,

and yet here I am.  In a way they were

right, I don't have the heart for this world.

(pause)

The question is, why am I having so much

trouble dying?

In a few short years, scientists will

have completed the Human Genome Project,

the mapping of all the genes that make

up a human being.

After 4 billion years of evolution by the

slow and clumsy method of natural selection,

we have now evolved to the point where we

can direct our own evolution.

If only we had aquired this knowledge

sooner, the following people would never

have been born:

HOMER

Blind from birth

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE

Epileptic

COLETTE

Arthritic

LOU GERHIG

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

(Lou Gerhig's Disease)

RITA HAYWORTH

Alzheimer's Disease

HELEN KELLER

Blind and deaf

STEPHEN HAWKING

Lou Gerhig's Disease

JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE

Asthmatic

CHARLES DARWIN

Chronic invalid

Even Charles Darwin, the man who told of

the survival of the fittest, numbered

amongst our frailest.

Of course, the other birth that would

surely never have taken place is your own.
