FIRST DRAFT

August 6, 1995

HAYES

... last few years have brought many

advances in the interests of women

in naval service, particularly in

the land-based maritime specialties.

What's more, the Navy has instituted

special sensitivity courses with an

eye on --

DEHAVEN

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based

maritime specialties." Gimme a

second here to de-euphemize that...

DEHAVEN

Would that be anything like

"typing"?  "Restocking the

cupboards"?  That sort of thing, Mr.

Hayes?

HAYES

Hardly the case, Senator.

DEHAVEN

Well, I'm just an old dame without

much time left, so you'll pardon me

if I jump right in here before they

discontinue my blood-type.  I am

deeply concerned over the Navy's

seemingly incontrovertible attitude

toward women in the military.  Case

in point...

DEHAVEN

"The Lark Report."

HAYES

Madam Senator... this is an internal

document of the U.S. Navy.  I must

seriously question whether --

DEHAVEN

(to others on panel)

The Navy's conclusion regarding the

crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft

carrier.  Female aviator, it just so

happens.

(to Hayes)

You're familiar with this report and

its conclusion, am I right?

HAYES

I was one member of the investigating

commission.

DEHAVEN

Yes, I see your signature right here

-- twice the size of everyone

else's.  And your conclusion was

"pilot error," hmm?

HAYES

I'm really not prepared for any kind

of in-depth review of --

DEHAVEN

I'd like to think our next Secretary

of the Navy would be prepared for

anything, Mr. Hayes.

HAYES

The commission concluded that the

aviator in question failed to

execute a proper approach to the

carrier.

DEHAVEN

That aside for the moment, I'm

struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit

of your report... the degrading

remarks by other aviators...

innuendo about her performance in

unrelated situations... even a

reference to her sexual activity the

weekend prior.

(closing report)

In my seven years on this committee,

I've never seen a downed aviator

treated like this.  Never.  I'm

deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.

Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for

women in the military -- but for

your own confirmation as well.

DEHAVEN

... a full 35 percent of all jobs in

the U.S. military are still, to this

day, off-limits to women.  And

that's simply gotta change.

PRESS #1

What about those who say women

aren't suited for all jobs?  That

they're physically weaker... they

have less stamina...

DEHAVEN

Sure.  And we're gonna hog the

bathroom, too.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

White House boys want a private

meeting.

DEHAVEN

I'll act surprised.

WHITE HOUSE #1

... to reassure you that he has

every faith in the ability of Mr.

Hayes to guide the Navy into the

next century.  The task, as the

Administration sees it, is to

acknowledge changing realities

without losing traditional values.

DEHAVEN

'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on

the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go

back to the President and tell him

to open up the phone book and start

lookin' for his next nominee.

WHITE HOUSE #2

Administration's plan for 100

percent integration.  If female

candidates measure up in a series of

test cases, the President will

support full integration within

three years' time.

WHITE HOUSE #2

It's your gender-blind Navy,

Senator.  Surely you're not going to

balk now.

DEHAVEN

Well, it's just that askin' you all

to integrate the Navy is like

sending a man to do a woman's job.

(a beat)

How do you propose to handle the

Combat Exclusion Laws?

WHITE HOUSE #2

Keep narrowing the definitions.

Keep redefining.

WHITE HOUSE #1

We got around it in Saudi Arabia.

DEHAVEN

By calling women "Honorary Men."

Ingenious.

WHITE HOUSE #2

C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'

right down the center of your plate.

If women measure up to men, they've

got the job.  You going to take a

swing?  Or step out of the box?

HAYES

Well?

WHITE HOUSE #2

(shaking hand)

Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

HAYES

So she picks the women, we pick the

programs.  Seals?

FLAG OFFICER #1

I'd go Special Reconnaissance.

Every bit as tough -- and we have a

60 percent drop-out rate among the

men.

HAYES

Then I suggest we start there.

FLAG OFFICER #1

Doesn't matter who she picks.  No

woman is going to last one week in a

commando training course.  And I

don't care who it is.

JORDAN

Lieutenant O'Neil.

ROYCE (V.O.)

Gotta situation here.  Where are

you?  Stuck in traffic?

JORDAN

(checking dive watch)

Not due in for 22 minutes, sir.

Watcha got?

ROYCE

All right, stand by, we're going to

switch over to COMSAT...

TACTICAL OFFICER

Voice-system now secure...

ROYCE

(into speaker)

Okay, fresh stuff:  Lost a NATO

plane over the Sea of Japan.  ELB

signals leads us to believe the

pilot is alive and has made his way

to the North Korean shore, near a

fishing village, "Tamyung."

JORDAN (V.O.)

Do we know it's him using the

beacon?  Not a decoy?

ROYCE

Signals received only sparingly, in

such a pattern that leads us to

conclude it is a downed aviator

trying to conserve his batteries.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Chances of recovery?

ROYCE

You're the analyst for East China,

O'Neil.  Analyze.

JORDAN

North Korean beaches are the best

protected, most heavily monitored in

the world.  The civilian population

is so propagandized that it acts as

an Early Warning system.  Extraction

team has to be small and silent --

I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.

Problem is, don't want to hold a

conventional sub off-shore for

target practice.  Where's The Polk?

ROYCE

Halfway 'round the world.  So that's

the problem -- we can get the team

in, just not out.

JORDAN

(an inspired beat)

Unless you Whiskey Run.

ROYCE

Blank faces here, O'Neil.

JORDAN

Quick-hit technique used by Capone.

Rigged a getaway car with running

boards and handles.  All his guys

had to do was jump on and take a

ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 --

I doped it out as a contingency

plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks

up the package, links up with

recovery sub.  But don't waste time

opening and closing hatches.  They

just grab the periscope and hang on

for neutral waters.

ROYCE

You expect the extraction team to

ride the sub bare-back?  Is that

correct, O'Neil?

JORDAN

Only four minutes to neutral waters,

sir.  Why not?

ROYCE

All right, sending the

recommendation across the river.

Royce out.

JORDAN

No, thank you, sir.

ROYCE

That was good headwork, lieutenant.

JORDAN

Thank you, sir.  We hear back from

the Pentagon?

ROYCE

(scoffing)

Probably hear back from CNN first.

JORDAN

Hate this part.  Just sweating it

out on the sidelines.

ROYCE

Intel has its own glory, lieutenant

-- no matter how subtle.

ROYCE

By the way, I'll need that option

paper by 11-hundred today so I can

review it with Admiral Hanover.  And

do we have any of that breakfast tea

around here?

JORDAN

(with a look)

Is this my glory, sir?

N.I.C. SECRETARY

Excuse me, but I have Senator

DeHaven on the line for you.

ROYCE

Jesus God, what now?

N.I.C. SECRETARY

I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to

speak with Lieutenant O'Neil.

DEHAVEN

(into phone)

So everyone I talk to says you're

top drawer with silk stockings

inside.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask

what this is regarding?

DEHAVEN

(reading file)

High-school pentathlete... ROTC

scholarship, graduated with

honors... top marks in Basic

Training... and, as it just so

happens, a constituent of my home

state of Virginia.  Oh, the things

I'll do for one extra vote.

DEHAVEN

Lieutenant O'Neil, I am prepared to

nominate you for the Navy's Special

Reconnaissance program.  Should you

accept, you'll ship out to Coronado

next week and join in the big

testosterone festival.  Complete the

course, and you'll have a fast

ticket to any assignment you want.

That's my personal promise to you.

JORDAN

"Coronado."

DEHAVEN

California.

JORDAN

I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just

that... Beggin' your pardon,

Senator, but... do you understand

that this involves combat training?

DEHAVEN

This is just a test case, O'Neil.

But if it works out -- if you work

out -- it could well change the

Navy's official policy on women in

combat.  Or, actually, its official

non-policy.  Now who's your

immediate superior there?

JORDAN

Captain Dwyer.  Technically.

DEHAVEN

My office will fill him in and help

expedite.  Look forward to meeting

you at the proper time.  Jumping off

now...

JORDAN

Uh, question, ma'am.

DEHAVEN

Yes, dear.

JORDAN

Would I be the only one?  The only

woman?

DEHAVEN

There'll be more to follow -- but

yes, dear, right now you're the pick

of a very large litter.  And your

success would mean a lot.  Jumping,

now...

JORDAN

Well, shit-a-doodle-do...

JORDAN (O.S.)

... well, I survived Basic Training

and three brothers -- so I know how

to fight.  What scares me are the

sexual politics.  I don't want to be

turned into some poster girl for

women's rights.

ROYCE

So why're you even considering it?

Are you?

JORDAN

Just like you would be.

ROYCE

Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world-

class warriors.  And they will not

want you there, Jordan.

JORDAN

I take it you don't either.  Feet.

ROYCE

Well, you're doin' shit-hot at

Intel.

JORDAN

Royce.  We're the same age, we

started the same time -- and now

you're sitting in the upperdecks

while I'm still down in the bullpen.

What does that tell you about the

Navy?

ROYCE

(shaking head)

She's haze grey and underway...

JORDAN

You need operational duty to really

advance... you need combat training

to go operational... yet combat

training is off-limits to people

with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel.

Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm

beating my head on a big brass

ceiling.

ROYCE

So dump on me.

JORDAN

This has nothing to do with you.

ROYCE

(getting out)

Well, guess I don't even need to be

here...

JORDAN

Get your dick back here.  It has

everything to do with you.

ROYCE

You're such a ball-breaker

sometimes.  Especially at night.

JORDAN

Sorry.  But after our days...

(a thoughtful sip)

So if I try this thing... if I ship

out to Coronado... what happens

here?

ROYCE

I'll try to keep the door open.  If

you wash out, I make it so that --

JORDAN

Wai', wait.  What happens if it

works?  Four months of training,

three years of operational duty.

What then?

ROYCE

(blowing a sigh)

I don't feel like doing an option

paper on the rest of my life,

Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it

happen.

JORDAN

Which is guy-speak for...

ROYCE

(conceding)

Sounded lame as soon as it came out

of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be

honest, okay?  Three years is a long

time.  Don't ask me to predict how

I'll feel then, Jordan, because I

don't know.  And either do you.

JORDAN

You know, right up until you said

that -- I thought I did know.

ROYCE

Jordan...

JORDAN

Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up

like such a tough call -- and then

you go and make it so goddamn easy.

Really, thank you so much.

JORDAN

Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told

this is where I check in.

DUTY OFFICER

(looking up)

So you're the one.

JORDAN

Still don't have my bearings yet.

Direct me to the officer's quarters?

DUTY OFFICER

You'll proceed directly to the

infirmary for eye tests, blood

tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.

Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're

to report to the Base Commander.

He'd like a word with you.

JORDAN

Fine.  And the officer's quarters?

DUTY OFFICER

C.O.'s office can supply you with

directions.  Enjoy your visit,

lieutenant.

BLONDELL

B.O.Q., south side.  Take a

starboard tack out the door.

JORDAN

Thank you, ensign.

BLONDELL

No problem, lieutenant.

C.O.

Come.

YEOMAN

Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting,

sir.

C.O.

Yes, of course.  Please, have a

seat, lieutenant...

JORDAN

Thank you, sir.

C.O.

Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?

JORDAN

I'm fine, sir.

C.O.

So.  We're still coming to terms

with the exact protocol for this --

for integrating the Spec-Recon

training.  It may not always be

smooth, but we're trying to make it

as painless as possible for you.

JORDAN

Thank you, sir.  But I expect a

certain amount of pain.

JORDAN

Barber was my next stop, sir.

Would've had it regulation sooner,

only --

C.O.

Don't worry about it.  If it's off

your collar and out of your eyes,

that's all I'm going to ask.

JORDAN

Really, I have no problem with --

C.O.

I'm not out to change your sex,

lieutenant.  You'll have separate

beds, separate heads.  If you have

specific medical needs, inform the

infirmary.  If a classmate or

superior acts in an harassing or

otherwise unbecoming manner, please

inform me immediately so I can deal

with it immediately.  Questions?

JORDAN

None at this time, sir.

C.O.

Then that's all I have to say.

Dismissed.

JORDAN

Sir, I just want you to know... I'm

not here to make a statement.  I

don't want to make men look foolish.

All I care about is completing the

training and getting operational

experience -- just like everyone

else, I suspect.

C.O.

If you were like everyone else,

lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be

making statements about not making

statements, would we?

(a beat)

Take your leave.

MILLER

What am I scannin' here?

C.O.

Special Reconnaissance.  Here you

will be trained to infiltrate

hostile territory... to be the real-

time eyes on the ground... to

recover assigned targets and, if

need be, to fight your way out under

adverse conditions.

C.O.

That is all that will be said about

the special nature of this class --

by us or by you.  Many of you have

waited years for admission to this

program.  Opportunities like this

are rare -- and those who seize upon

them are rarer still.

C.O.

Other than that, there is little to

be said but "Good luck, gentleman."

(correcting)

"Gentlepersons."

C.O.

Now I turn you over to the chief

training officer.  He has earned six

naval commendations, the purple

heart, and the Navy Cross for

heroism and valor.  I give you

Master Chief John James Urgayle.

THE CHIEF

The sun and moon... the ebb and flow

of the Pacific tides... global

warming... the very angle of the

Earth upon its axis... these are

just some of the things I control in

my world.

MCCOOL

We're fucked.

SLUTNIK

Darth Vader reads poetry...

MCCOOL

We are so fucked.

INSTRUCTOR

Count down... one, two... count

down... three, four...

CLASS CADENCE

One, two, three, four... One, two,

three, four...

THE CHIEF

You may think that you are the

brightest, the best, the strongest.

I assure you, that is a total

delusion on your part.  It is my job

to show you just how weak human

beings can truly be.  60 percent of

you will not finish this course.

How do I know?  Because that is an

historical fact.

THE CHIEF

Poles down.

THE CHIEF

Now for the bad new:  I always like

to get one quitter on the first day.

And until I do, the first day does

not end.  So look around right now

-- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's

gonna be...

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Down to BVDs!

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Now face the Pacific... link arms...

and take a stroll!

STAMM

What is it with the damn phone

poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or

GTE?

WICKWIRE

Just trying to thin the herd.

That's all they want to do right

now.

SLUTNIK

Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to

point?

NEWBERRY

Wow.  You see that girl?

WICKWIRE

I got eyes, Newberry.

SLUTNIK

One night.  Just one night in my

room, she'd forget all about playin'

commando.

ENGLAND

Tone that shit down, Slutnik.  You

heard with they said.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Out of the water!

THE CHIEF

Now make like sugar cookies and roll

in the sand for me.

THE CHIEF

Collect those poles, gentlemen.

Still a lotta beachfront you haven't

seen...

ENGLAND

How bad?  Stamm?

JORDAN

We better get a medic over --

STAMM

No, goddamnit.  No.

INSTRUCTOR

Up!  Up!  Up!  Up!

THE CHIEF

Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It

will keep you awake in times of

emergency... it will tell you when

you are seriously injured... it will

keep you angry and remind you to

finish the job and get the hell

home.  But you know the best thing

about pain?

CLASS

No, sir!

THE CHIEF

It lets you know that you aren't

dead yet.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Go regulation if you can't do the

reverses, O'Neil.

JORDAN

Thank you, sir.  But I like these

just fine.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.

JORDAN

I'll try anyway, sir.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

You'll try what we tell you to try,

O'Neil.  Go regulation.

THE CHIEF

Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder,

who is it gonna be...

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

On your belly... on your back... on

your feet... on your belly... on

your back... on your feet...

THE CHIEF

You have noticed a ship's bell

hanging at the west side of this

courtyard.  If, at any time, you

feel you cannot continue with your

training -- that bell is your

salvation.  Strike it three times,

and the ordeal is over.

THE CHIEF

Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll

make it as easy as I can.

THE CHIEF

Now you don't have to watch me

watching you break rank.  Because I

know someone here wants to do it.

THE CHIEF

Now I know what you're thinking...

SLUTNIK

(low)

I'm thinkin' we could jump him right

now...

THE CHIEF

"Can I really take 15 weeks of this

bubonic asshole?"  If you don't know

the answer to that question, the

answer is "No, you cannot."  And

that is another historical fact.  So

do it.  Admit you don't have what it

takes... admit you are out of your

depth -- or we're all heading back

to the beach right now.

(waiting a beat)

Instructors!  Time hack!

THE CHIEF

Six... five... four... three...

two... one... HACK!

(to class)

The time is now 12-hundred.  The sun

is shining brightly.  Plenty of

daylight left for another phone-pole

run...

THE CHIEF

Leave your helmet there, Stamm.

Back to the barracks.

THE CHIEF

The rest of you should remember one

thing.  The only easy day was today.

Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it

over to you.

WICKWIRE

Cuh-lass, face right!

ENGLAND

Better look elsewhere, O'Neil.

SLUTNIK

Half a night, Lord, just gimme half

a night to set her straight...

MILLER

Average woman is 25 percent body

fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man.

Think about that.

MCCOOL

Nice distribution, though.

MILLER

No way does she makes this program.

No way.

VOICE

It's not so much that they hate

you...

WICKWIRE

They're more afraid of you.

JORDAN

Well, now I feel so much better.

WICKWIRE

It was made clear before you came --

harassment equals career suicide.

Can't say anything good, so they

don't say much at all.  To your

face, anyway.

JORDAN

Whose orders were those?

WICKWIRE

It was made clear.

(getting up)

Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's

hell, then it levels out.  Until

S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's

hell-and-a-half.

JORDAN

And how do you know that?

WICKWIRE

Made it to Week 10 last time.

JORDAN

I didn't know they let you try

again.  Especially at your age.

WICKWIRE

You're kind of a surprise yourself.

THE CHIEF

England, 88 seconds.  You're good to

go for the slide-for-life.

Wickwire, roll back till you get

south of 90.

WICKWIRE

Fuck.  Yes sir.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Who'd you kiss to get back in here,

anyway?

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

Hang on, here...

CORTEZ

Aw, what is this...

JORDAN

(mortified)

Sir...

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but

it's gotta go out.

(calling out)

Five... four... three...

JORDAN

I can make this wall without --

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

... two... one... MARK!

CLASS

Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!

CORTEZ

Shit of a saint...

CLASS

Take her, take her here, Cortez...

lookit that monkey-man go... hoo-

yah, hoo-yah...

THE CHIEF

Cortez, 93 seconds.  O'Neil, 94.

Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery

on your gonads and line up again.

O'Neil... move ahead.

JORDAN

Say again, sir?

THE CHIEF

You heard me.  Move on.

CORTEZ

Aw, this is such bullshit...

JORDAN

Chief, sir, I don't understand

why --

THE CHIEF

Educate her, Pyro.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Automatic five-second deduction,

which slips you under the wire.

It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil

-- standard procedure for all

females in physical training

courses.  Where you been the last

few years?

JORDAN

What "all females"?  If I'm the

only --

THE CHIEF

Twice now, I have said the words

"move on."

SLUTNIK

Can't live with them, can't kill

them.  What's the point?

MCCOOL

Somebody throw a tent over this

circus.

WICKWIRE

(low to Jordan)

Just let it go.  If it's in your

favor, just shut the hell up and

take it.

JORDAN

Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told

me to come to you immediately if I

felt I was being mistreated in any

way.

C.O.

Didn't take long.

C.O.

All right, lieutenant, give me a

name and specifics, I'll have the

X.O. file an action first thing in

the morning.

(waits)

A name?

JORDAN

It's you, sir.  And it started the

day I came here.

C.O.

(jolted)

Oh, really.

JORDAN

It's this double-standard, the

separate quarters, the deferential

treatment.  It's how you pulled out

my chair and nearly served high tea

the first time we met.

C.O.

Because I was civil, now you're

complaining.

JORDAN

I can't afford civility, sir.  How

am I supposed to fit in with these

guys when you've got me set up as an

outsider?  Even if I make it under

these rules, I still lose, because

there'll always be a flag in my file

-- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I

mean, really -- why didn't you just

issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear

around the base?

C.O.

Did you just have a brain-fart?

JORDAN

Pardon?

C.O.

Did you just barge in here and curse

at your base commander?  If so, I

regard that as a bonafide brain-

fart, and I resent it when people

fart inside my home.

JORDAN

I think you've resented me from the

start, sir.

C.O.

(building)

What I resent, lieutenant, is some

politician using my base as a test

tube for her grand social

experiment.  What I resent is the

sensitivity training that is now

mandatory for my men... the day-care

center I have to build where an

officer's lounge used to be... and

the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff

just so someone can keep track of

your personal pap smears.

(drawing close)

But most of all, lieutenant, I

resent your perfume, however subtle

it may be, competing with the aroma

of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-

nine cent cigar, which I will

happily put out this very instant if

the phallic nature of it happens to

offend your goddamn fragile

sensibilities.  DOES IT?

JORDAN

No, sir.

C.O.

No, sir, WHAT?

JORDAN

The shape doesn't bother me.  It's

just that goddamn rotten stench.

C.O.

Well.  'Least now we're talking the

same language.

(a beat)

So one standard.  Is that what

you're after?

JORDAN

Same rules for everyone, sir.

C.O.

Straight up?

JORDAN

Across the board, sir.

C.O.

And if you just happen to wash out,

I won't have to contend with you

bitchin' to some hairy-chested

female Senator?  And please note I

did not identify any one in

particular.

JORDAN

Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

C.O.

Then good night.

JORDAN

So I'll get a fair shot?

C.O.

You'll get everything you want,

O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what

you're gonna get.

BLONDELL

This some kind of joke?

SLUTNIK

Well, who the shit you think you

are?  Comin' in here like that?

JORDAN

Your new roommate.

JORDAN

Anybody usin' these drawers here?

SLUTNIK

Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You

can't stay in here.  You can't sleep

right next to me.

JORDAN

Funny, the C.O. says I can.

SLUTNIK

Aw, lookit this, lookit this --

she's bringin' Tampax in here.

C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms

over there.

JORDAN

That your desk?  I'll take this one.

SLUTNIK

WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?

JORDAN

(whirling on him)

Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay.

And if you don't want me for a

roommate or classmate, you got two

options -- move out or ring out.

End of file.

JORDAN

What about you, McCool?  Any problem

with the room assignment?

MCCOOL

"It's not a job -- it's an

adventure."

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

58 degrees this morning!  That's not

a bad water temp, really -- if

you're standing where we are!

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

Slurred speech, lack of proper motor

control, short-term amnesia -- all

early signs of hypothermia!

Advanced hypothermia is easy to

detect in a classmate!  He'll look

like he's dead!

THE CHIEF

Body heat.  In situations of extreme

cold, you can always count on body

heat to keep you alive -- and I do

not mean your own.  We will break

you of the cultural barriers that

dictate you should not invade

another man's space.  Are any of you

in a situation of extreme cold right

now?

CLASS

Yes, sir!

THE CHIEF

Then why aren't you all over the man

next to you?

JORDAN

Just do it, okay?

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

If you can't feel the other guy's

pecker, you ain't in tight enough!

I want nuts to butts!

JORDAN

Come on, Montgomery...

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break

in that line?

JORDAN

(in his ear)

Montgomery, why do they call you

"Flea"?

FLEA

It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" --

but that gets whittled down to just

"Flea."  For short, ma'am.

JORDAN

So it really has nothing to do with

actual brain size?

FLEA

No, ma'am.

JORDAN

Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect

you just showed me.  But I don't

need it and don't want it -- not

that kind of respect, anyway.  It's

just gonna hurt us both, okay?

FLEA

I'll work on it, ma'am.

JORDAN

Do that.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

(to the Chief)

Time.

THE CHIEF

Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.

JORDAN

Hey.  You okay, Flea?

FLEA

'Snot me.  It's him.

MILLER

Jesus, my hands... they aren't

workin' right...

NEWBERRY

How long i'zis for?

WICKWIRE

'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals,

no more.

NEWBERRY

Swear each time's gettin' longer.

MCCOOL

This where you bailed last time,

Wick?

WICKWIRE

Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February

last time, either.

FLEA

How you doin', Miller?  Miller?

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

22 minutes...

THE CHIEF

Remember, all this is completely

voluntary.  For any of you who don't

want to continue, Instructor Johns

is now serving coffee and danish at

the ambulance.

THE CHIEF

Any takers?

SLUTNIK

He's the fuckin' Antichrist.

MCCOOL

Wick!  They really got donuts over

there?  Or just some'a last night's

dinner rolls?

FLEA

Look like donuts to me...

JORDAN

(in disbelief)

What're you guys doing?  Huh?

MCCOOL

Just askin'

JORDAN

What, you gonna give it all up for a

maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be?

That's exactly what they --

CLASS

NO!

MEDICS

Tell me what day this is... look at

me now... what city are you from,

sailor... here, look right here...

THE CHIEF

You want another minute to think

about this?  Huh?

(no response; to

Miller directly)

Do any of you want to reconsider?

THE CHIEF

Johnson.  Get 'em out of my scan.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

By my watch... which, of course

appears to be broken... they've been

in 27 minutes without the benefit of

protective gear.

THE CHIEF

(into bullhorn)

Everybody out.

WICKWIRE

Hey.  Way to gut it out.

JORDAN

Thanks, Wick.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

(shaking head)

Miller.  Thought the guy was made of

depleted uranium.  Really didn't

expect to lose him.

THE CHIEF

Every class has its surprises, Pyro.

This one'll be no different.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Change those clothes, be back here

in six minutes!  And I am timing

you!

SLUTNIK

Jesus Christ.  And I only got three

minutes apiece...

ENGLAND

(jerking him away)

Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik.

You ain't their type.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

O'Neil!  What're you gawking at?

P.R. FLAK

(reading newspaper)

"... last week at Coronado.  The

woman, identity unknown, is believed

to be the first female candidate for

the elite Special Reconnaissance

program.  Her presence could signal

a shift in the Navy's long-standing

policy that excludes women from

combat positions."

C.O.

(calling O.S.)

I'm asking again.  Where is she?

YEOMAN

Inbound now, sir.  Had to pull her

out of the dive bell.

P.R. FLAK

I have interview requests from two

local TV stations.  And a

sociologist from U.C. San Diego

called, wanted to know if she could

examine the interaction between

"G.I. Jane" and the men.

C.O.

"A sociol..."  Kill the interviews.

I don't need civilians nosin' around

in matters that are supposed to be

covert in nature.  Just kill 'em

before this whole thing gets outta

con --

YEOMAN

Senator DeHaven calling, sir.

C.O. (V.O.)

Base Commander Turrentine speaking.

DEHAVEN

(hitting like a Scud)

Commander, are you of the habit of

letting photographers traipse around

your base snappin' their fill?

These were supposed to have been

discreet test cases --

C.O.

Senator, they stand out on the

public highway with telephoto

lenses --

DEHAVEN

-- and now I got reporters from

Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office

and askin' what I know about this

"G.I. Jane" thing.

C.O.

-- nothing I can do about it unless

you're suggesting I infringe on

their civil liberties -- which I'd

happily do if you'll just trim a

little fat off the Constitution.

DEHAVEN

Are you truly mouthin' off to a

senior member of the Senate Arms

Committee?  I mean, I'll give you

points for style -- just nothin' for

smarts.

JORDAN

See me, sir?

C.O.

You makin' friends with the press,

lieutenant?

DEHAVEN

Well, seein's how this thing is out,

you let me handle the r.p.m.  From

this point forward, I want all press

matters coordinated via my office.

I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna

watch Hayes pull flowers out of his

ass and take credit for this one.

Him or the President.

(aside to beautician)

This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"?

'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to

lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.

C.O.

Your prerogative, Senator.

DEHAVEN

Awright.  How's our girl doin',

anyway?

C.O.

Standing right here in my office.

DEHAVEN

Jordan, dear.  How are they treating

you?

JORDAN

(catching C.O.'s

eyes)

Can't complain, ma'am.

DEHAVEN

Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you

in person.

JORDAN

Uh, ma'am.

DEHAVEN

Gonna be visiting that all-woman's

America's cup team in a few weeks --

If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis

O'Conner's days are numbered.  But

they're in San Diego, so I thought

I'd take a quick promenade of the

base.

C.O.

Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements

generally take some time, Senator.

DEHAVEN

"Security"?  What the hell you

talkin' about?  Your base isn't

secure?

C.O.

Of course, but there's more --

DEHAVEN

Then set out the good plates, we'll

all have lunch.  My office will

follow up with details.  Jumping

off, now...

JORDAN

Sir, I want you to know that I had

nothing to do with any of this.  Not

this article, not --

C.O.

"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea.

Oh, and let's be sure to invite this

sociologist, too -- just in case we

want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME

AFTERWARDS!

YEOMAN

Sir?  Secretary Hayes calling.

JORDAN

(backing out)

Permission to leave, sir?

C.O.

Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.

DEHAVEN

Think I overplayed it?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

Congress and the Pentagon share a

lot of plumbing.  They'll never know

whose leak it is.

THE CHIEF

Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl,

Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise.

Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior

officer.  Follow his orders to your

death.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Get it up!

THE CHIEF

Boat Six -- England, O'Neil, McCool,

Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik.

Lieutenant England is your senior

officer.

JORDAN

Ah, c'mon...

CORTEZ

Motherachrist...

SLUTNIK

Me?  Again?

THE CHIEF

(looking up)

Somebody got a problem with the

muster?

JORDAN

Fine by me, sir!

CORTEZ

No problem, sir!

SLUTNIK

Full of joy here, sir!

THE CHIEF

Boat Seven...

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

(into bullhorn)

First crew to finish gets hot food

and warm racks for the night!  Rest

of you are digging hide-sites and

eating earthworms tonight!

McCool

Don't wanna be pickin' no sandcrabs

outta my ass tonight!

ENGLAND

So shutup and stroke, McCool!

SLUTNIK

Hoo-yah!  Hoo-yah!

THE CHIEF

Your boat just hit razor coral.

What do you do now?

ENGLAND

Patch and pump!  C'mon!  Whose ass

is on the kit?

MCCOOL

I say keep paddlin'!  We're

almost --

ENGLAND

Forget it, McCool!  Pri One is to

save the boat, not win a race!  So

let's get on it!

CORTEZ

Four years I petition to get into

this program.  Four years.  Finally

get here, and now it's co-ed?  Such

bullshit.  Now I'm gettin' hammered

just 'cuz she's on our crew.

SLUTNIK

Least you don't have to sleep with

her every goddamn night.

CORTEZ

Tellin' you, I'd rather be the last

class with balls than the first one

with chicks.

CUT TO:

MCCOOL

Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a

Navy man.  Wanted to fire them big

guns on a big-ass battleship.  But

Navy said to him, "Oh, no.  You can

only do one thing on a battleship."

"Well what's that?" grandaddy said.

"Cook," they said.  Now this ain't

100 years ago -- I'm talkin' United

States Navy, middla World War II.

And you know the reason they gave

him?  You know why they tol' my

grandaddy he couldn't fight for his

country?

ENGLAND

He talked too much?

MCCOOL

"Negroes can't see at night.  Bad

night vision."

JORDAN

You're kiddin' me.

MCCOOL

See, you just the new nigger on the

block, O'Neil.  That's all.  And

maybe you moved in too early.

C.O.

What in God's name...

CNN COMMENTATOR (TV)

... is denying that it is

considering changing its long-held

policy of exclusion -- but it isn't

denying the presence of at least one

female in a heretofore all-male

program.  Dubbed "G.I. Jane" by the

media, this woman is now undergoing

commando training at the Special

Warfare Command Center in San

Diego...

ROYCE

Goddamn.  My poster girl.

CNN COMMENTATOR (TV)

Senator DeHaven's office still has

not released the identity of the

woman, but DeHaven is confirming

that "G.I. Jane" has outlasted many

of her male counter-parts in the

program, said to be one of the most

grueling anywhere.  Joining us now

on "Washington Tonight" for the

feminist perspective is Gloria

Allred, live from --

COMPLIMENTS (O.S.)

Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.  Say

hello to the President for me...

Maybe now you can change that carpet

in your office, Teddy... So what was

the deal you made with DeHaven?  Or

was it the Devil?  Always get them

confused...

HAYES

Didn't you hear?  Effective

immediately, all navy vessels can no

longer be referred to as "she."

CUT TO:

VOICE #1

... women are child-bearers.  Life-

givers.  Now we're going to make

them killers?

VOICE #2

... just don't have the upper-body

strength...

VOICE #3

How strong do you need to be to

launch a rocket?  To push a button

or pull a trigger?

DIAL-A-DATE

Are we going to dance?

ROYCE

Not right now.

E-RINGER

Commander Royce.  How's life across

the river?

ROYCE

Little slow, sir.  When's the

Pentagon going to send me a good

crisis?

E-RINGER

I'll check my out-basket in the

morning.  Say, do you know...

CIRCLE #1

... but men have trained as athletes

for 5,000 years.  Women have been at

it for, what, couple of decades?  Do

we really know the limits of their

strength?

CIRCLE #2

Or their endurance?  You know, 30

years ago, women marathoners were 90

minutes off the pace of the men.

Now, the women's time is probably

only 20 minutes off.

CIRCLE #1

Try 15.

CIRCLE #3

But what do female soldiers really

contribute?  I mean, why is this

"G.I. Jane" there instead of a man?

ROYCE

(to dial-a-date)

You wait right here.  I'll get the

drinks.

VOICE #1

Take my word for it.  It's just not

going to happen.  Not now, not

anytime soon.

VOICE #2

You're guaranteeing that?

VOICE #1

I have it on unorthodox but reliable

authority that combat positions will

remain off-limits.  Despite what's

happening with our Babe in Boyland.

NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)

Well, isn't that what these test

cases are supposed to decide?

(thinking)

Unless, of course, you're suggesting

that "G.I. Jane" is on her way to

becoming "Jane Doe"...

BALD SPOT (VOICE #2)

All I'm saying is that we won't be

integrating -- despite the rhetoric

coming off Capitol Hill, despite

what's happening in Coronado.  And

you did not hear it from me.

NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)

Hear what?

DIAL-A-DATE

There you are.  Can we please dance

now?

ROYCE

Lieutenant!

J.O.

Yes sir?

ROYCE

Take a dance!

DISSOLVE TO:

THE CHIEF

Crew Six!  Stand by!

ENGLAND

Flea!  'Cool!  O'Neil!  Cortez!

Slutnik!  In that order!  Five-

second intervals!  Let's go!

CORTEZ

Hoo-yah!  Better'n sex in a car

crash!

THE CHIEF

(to pilot)

Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep

goin'!

THE CHIEF (O.S.)

You know, the Israelis...

THE CHIEF

... they tried women in the 1967

War.  Female soldiers.

JORDAN

Permission to get dressed, sir?

THE CHIEF

It seems the men couldn't get used

to the sight of women blown open and

their viscera hanging from tree

limbs.  Israeli men would linger

over wounded females -- often to the

detriment of the mission, often

endangering their own lives.  They

don't use women anymore.

JORDAN

(moving closer)

Sir, someone mentioned you received

the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you

got it for?

THE CHIEF

For pulling a 210-pound man out of a

burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.

JORDAN

I see.  So when a man tries to

rescue another man, he's a hero.

But when he tries to rescue a woman,

he's gone soft.

THE CHIEF

Could you have pulled that 210-pound

man clear, lieutenant?

THE CHIEF

Females in combat situations impact

unit cohesion.  Men fight better

without women around.  And that is

an historical fact.

JORDAN

It also seems like a problem with

the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe

you should be sniffing around their

shower room instead.

THE CHIEF

England went out with a stress

fracture.  That puts you in charge,

lieutenant.

JORDAN

(off-balance)

McCool's that same rank.  We're both

j.g.'s.

THE CHIEF

You were commissioned one month

earlier, which makes you the senior

officer.

(passing her on his

way out)

Remember.  There are no bad crews --

only bad leaders.

CORTEZ

(pissed)

No operational experience, and now

she's callin' the shots?

Unbelievable.

SLUTNIK

Suppose she'll wanna eat with us

now...

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

O'Neil... O'Neil... O'NEIL!

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

One burst, one body, O'Neil!  What

the fuck you trying to do?  Spell

your name?

(to class)

You are not infantry!  Your

firepower is limited!  Excessive

killing only risks compromise...

BLONDELL (O.S.)

S.E.R.E. training coming up.

BLONDELL

They take you away to San Clemente

Island.  Half the guys quit when

they come back.  Supposed to be just

hell-and-a-half.

JORDAN

That's what I hear.

BLONDELL

Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant?

How come you're doing this?  I mean,

we're kinda curious.

JORDAN

Who's "we"?

BLONDELL

Just some of the women.

JORDAN

I don't know if there's any single

reason.  But my father was Navy.

And he had this old-time recruiting

poster in his den.  It showed a girl

trying on a sailor's uniform while

saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man!

I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10

years old when I first saw it, and

even then it felt wrong.  Made me

mad.  And I don't think a month has

gone by that I haven't thought about

that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a

man."

BLONDELL

I've been accused of that wish.

JORDAN

The woman I saw you with...

BLONDELL

Just a friend.  We have friends,

too, you know.

JORDAN

But are there... I mean, how many...

BLONDELL

More than you'd guess.  It's just

that we don't hold coffee klatches.

If more then three of us get

together at any one time, the guys

think it's some kind of uprising.

BLONDELL

Sounds funny now, but it's really

not.  We have to be careful.  The

Navy still knows how to put on a

witch-hunt.

JORDAN

Royce...

ROYCE

(into phone)

I've been trying you for five days.

Don't they give you messages?

JORDAN (V.O.)

It's hard to find time to sleep,

Royce.  Much less keep up with my

phone life.

ROYCE

How hard they making it on you?

ROYCE (V.O.)

That bad?

JORDAN

I feel like there's men here,

there's women here -- then there's

men.  But hey, what'd I expect?

ROYCE

Well, not this.  I was doing the

Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got

some fresh stuff -- about you.  You

may be in a hostile camp.  I think

someone may be taking steps to

ensure that you crash and burn.

JORDAN

Me?  Why me?

ROYCE

Don't you know?  How they're talking

about you?

JORDAN

I saw an article...

ROYCE

I can't walk two blocks in

Washington without hearing about

"G.I. Jane."  You're all over the

place, and whether you wanted it or

not, the feminists are sizing you up

for that poster.

JORDAN

So why are you telling me this?

ROYCE

Big symbols make big targets,

Jordan.  I think someone's gunning

for you.

JORDAN

You know, Royce, I got enough heat

on me without you turning up the

jets, too.

ROYCE

I'm only trying to warn you in

case --

JORDAN

Well, let me warm you:  I'm going

though with this.  The more

everybody fucks with me, fucks with

my head, the more it just makes me

want to finish.  So don't expect me

back crying in your arms any time

soon, okay?

ROYCE

That's not what I want, Jordan.  I

mean... it is and it isn't...

JORDAN

Still can't make up your mind, huh?

Gotta go, Royce.

ROYCE

Jordan.  You watch your ass.

JORDAN

Sure.  I'll join the crowd.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Infiltrate... establish your hide-

site... record any movement of

troops, vehicles, patrols -- any

activity inside your scan.  If you

are compromised, you have two

options!  Newberry!

NEWBERRY

Evasive maneuvers or radio for

emergency extraction, sir!

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

If you are extracting, be damn sure

to follow procedures you have

learned in your classroom training!

A helo cannot extract you from a

wooded area!  You must bring it down

in a clearing!  What's the minimum

clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk,

McCool?

MCCOOL

32 feet, six inches, sir!

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

You will be penalized for early

extraction, but you will be

penalized more for capture -- trust

me, far more!  Survival!  Evasion!

Rescue!  Evacuation!  Welcome to

S.E.R.E.!

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Lieutenant!  Don't back down!

SLUTNIK

Feel right at home, McCool?

JORDAN

(nodding direction)

South-southeast.  And I don't want

to hear another word till we're

underground.

MCCOOL

(peering into scope)

Got two FAVs moving south.  I

make... four banditos aboard,

carrying... H-60 machine guns...

JORDAN

Newberry, get a photo.  South?

CORTEZ

Entering my scan now...

JORDAN

West?

SLUTNIK

Clear.

JORDAN

North?

FLEA

Clear.

CORTEZ

FAVs clear.

MCCOOL

You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.

SLUTNIK

So am I.

CORTEZ

Anyone?

FLEA

Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone

came down with uric poisoning, el-

tee.

JORDAN

Didn't even bitch about the seat,

did I?

MCCOOL

What the... Got an unknown here.

100 yards north-northeast.

MCCOOL

She part of the training?

JORDAN

I don't know...

SLUTNIK

"She?"  There's another one?

MCCOOL

Shit.  Think we're had.

CORTEZ

Smoke her.

MCCOOL

I ain't gonna shoot her.

CORTEZ

Only blanks.  Lemme do it.

MCCOOL

(pushing him away)

Hey.  Ain't your call, man.

JORDAN

Pri One is to protect the mission.

If she represents a real threat, we

have to do it.

JORDAN

(to McCool)

But did she see us?  Do you know for

a fact that we are compromised?

JORDAN

If not, firing will only give away

our position to hostiles in the

area.  Now how smart is that?

MCCOOL

(a beat)

Mighta been civilian.

NEWBERRY

They got regular peeps on this

island, don't they?

CORTEZ

(at scope)

Banditos on the east perimeter!  150

yards!  Shit, she was part of it!

MCCOOL

Fuck me.

FLEA

What's the word, el-tee?  We're

about one minute from a major take-

down here.

JORDAN

All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers.

Drop everything but weapons and the

PRC radio -- we're gonna be high

speed, low drag all the way to the

link-up site.  Ready?

SLUTNIK

Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.

JORDAN

MOVE!

SLUTNIK

This ain't workin' right!

MCCOOL

What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?

SLUTNIK

This ain't even workin' wrong!

FLEA

Really don't wanna be captured, el-

tee.  Heard some bad things.

JORDAN

Fuck.

(snatching the radio)

Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew

Six requesting emergency extraction.

Stand by for a PRC fix...

MCCOOL

32 feet, six inches!

JORDAN

I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!

JORDAN

'Cool?

MCCOOL

(doesn't care)

Smoke it!

FLEA

Where are you... HEY!  Where are you

taking her?

JORDAN

How long?

(no answer)

Please, HOW LONG?

JORDAN

"Don't know how much I can take"...

"A little taste of death"... "Save

the nail"...

(then the real kick-

in-the-teeth)

"It's been three days now"...

JORDAN

Who is it?

WICKWIRE (O.S.)

(a beat)

You know, I had an apartment about

this size once.

JORDAN

Wick.  They got your crew, too?

WICKWIRE (O.S.)

Intagliata was out chasing

breakfast.  They found his tracks.

Well, shit.

JORDAN

You really came back for more?  Of

this?

WICKWIRE (O.S.)

When I was sittin' behind a desk in

Washington, it made sense, somehow.

Blame it on my big brother.  He was

Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used

to tell...

JORDAN

If you got a good one, Wick...

WICKWIRE

One time he was doing a rekkie of

the Libyan coastline.  This is,

like, right before we bombed

Khadaffi into the past tense.  So

his crew does a nighttime infil,

maps all the big artillery

placements and stuff, then turns

around to get the hell gone.  But

between them and the water are five

Libyan guards, all armed to the

nuts.

JORDAN

They had to kill 'em?

WICKWIRE

Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But

on every guard's chest,they left one

Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little

calling card to say they'd been

there -- and could come back any

time they wanted.

JORDAN

That's a good story.

WICKWIRE

So the shit you gotta go through?

To get from here to there?  Brother

said it was worth it.  Worth the

training... worth the divorce...

worth anything.

JORDAN

He was married?

WICKWIRE

At first.

JORDAN

You got anybody, Wick?

WICKWIRE

Not me.  You?

WICKWIRE

O'Neil?

JORDAN

How'd you make it last time, Wick?

How'd you get through this part?

WICKWIRE

(a beat)

Last time I didn't.

JORDAN

(jarred)

Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep

talkin' to me...

ROYCE

(shaking head)

Suitable for framing...

ROYCE

Got time for a brain-pick?

THE SPOOK

Subject?

ROYCE

O'Neil, Jordan.

THE SPOOK

Thought you two were file-closed.

ROYCE

You knew about us?

THE SPOOK

Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.

ROYCE

Computer -- no transcription, no

com-link, no data-link.  In fact...

shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8,

mark.

THE SPOOK

All right.  So who stands to gain if

Jordan flames out in a big way?

ROYCE

The E-Ringers?  Full integration is

gonna cost the services billions at

the worst possible time -- when

Congress is already swinging the

axe.

THE SPOOK

(agreeing)

Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But

Pentagon's a big place.  Let's

narrow the sights.

ROYCE

The Navy?  They've made it clear

they don't want to pull missiles out

of subs to make room for women's

heads.  What's it gonna cost to make

a fleet of Trident's co-ed?

THE SPOOK

Sabotage born of economics?

Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes

really going to start his watch with

such a public failure?

ROYCE

Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.

THE SPOOK

Hmm.  Let's aim higher.

THE SPOOK

The White House.  If Jordan wins,

DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well,

it's been said that the only man the

President fears -- ain't no man.

ROYCE

The first female President?

THE SPOOK

Don't for a second think she didn't

leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives

DeHaven a symbol that taps into the

biggest constituency of them all.

ROYCE

Women.

THE SPOOK

If you were the President, wouldn't

that put a little piss in your

shoes?

ROYCE

I don't know.  Seems...

THE SPOOK

This ain't about some little soldier

girl sloggin' her way through

commando school.  The implications

go way beyond.

ROYCE

Christ, I don't want to see her take

a fall.  She thinks I do, but...

THE SPOOK

I take it this file is still open.

ROYCE

(shaping his words)

Even tough I don't talk to her every

day -- I still talk to her every

day.  Know what I mean?

THE SPOOK

(nodding)

Okay, so now work it from the other

end.  Think about California -- and

how things might be handled there.

ROYCE

I don't...

(scoffing)

What, someone on base?  A "mole"?

THE SPOOK

This is what you get for brain-

picking an old CIA spook.  but if I

needed to control the outcome of

this test case, that's how I'd do

it.  A man-in-place.  Makes

everything very controllable.

THE CHIEF

What is your father's name?

THE CHIEF

Simple question, lieutenant.  No

reason not to answer.  What is your

father's name?

JORDAN

"Dad."

THE CHIEF

Any brothers?  Sisters?

JORDAN

Dick, Jane, and Spot.

THE CHIEF

Are you hungry?  What's your

favorite food?  We'll try to get it

for you.

JORDAN

Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not

going to get anywhere.  You might as

well put me in the cage.

THE CHIEF

You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right

here, right now.

JORDAN

Should I be afraid?

THE CHIEF

Right down to your worthless womb,

and I'll tell you why.  This is my

island.  My world.  And here I can

get away with shit that would get me

arrested anywhere else in the world.

Take another scan of my little joy-

boy outside.  If I can do that to a

Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to

you?  Huh?

THE CHIEF

Why didn't you shoot the woman,

O'Neil?

JORDAN

Wasn't deemed a threat.

THE CHIEF

She led us right to you.  That's no

threat?

THE CHIEF

Would you have shot if it was a man?

JORDAN

No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --

THE CHIEF

The others already told me, O'Neil.

They wanted to shoot, but you

wouldn't let them.  Because you went

soft on another women --

JORDAN

That's not right.

THE CHIEF

That's what your crew said.  Are

they lying?  Or are you?

JORDAN

I think you're the liar.

THE CHIEF

I'm not the one who got five good

men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You

wear the bars, you made the call,

and you got your whole crew --

JORDAN

We didn't know we were compromised.

Firing would only've given away our

position.

THE CHIEF

You think we should go easy on

women, O'Neil?

THE CHIEF

Do you?

JORDAN

No.

THE CHIEF

I'm so glad we agree.

THE CHIEF

Didn't you know you'd be raped if

you were captured?  Didn't you even

think about that?

JORDAN

Sure.  Just like your men do.

THE CHIEF

I think we oughtta practice it,

just so you know what to expect.

JORDAN

Should I practice bleeding, too,

sir?  Would that make me a better

soldier?

THE CHIEF

(to the men)

Any of you can stop this!  Just give

me the location of one more hide-

site, and it ends right here!

SLUTNIK

(wide-eyed)

Someone's trippin' out here...

THE CHIEF

Three crews are still on this island

somewhere.  Who knows where?

JORDAN

Don't do it, don't do it...

THE CHIEF

Who's gonna tell me?  Who's gonna be

chivalrous and stop this abuse?

What, you want to see her get

mauled?  Is that it?

JORDAN

Don't tell him shi --

THE CHIEF

(waving them back)

She's fine!

(squatting beside)

When I put you down, O'Neil, take

the hint and stay down.

THE CHIEF

(for her ears only)

I am saving your life, O'Neil.  You

may not know it, but I do.  You're

an inferior soldier, a bad officer,

and I don't want you learning that

inconvenient truth when you're stuck

in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy

lines and don't know how the fuck to

get out.  You get out now, O'Neil.

Seek life elsewhere.  And if you

can't do it in front of me, do it

behind my back.

MCCOOL

Down... stay down...

JORDAN

Fuck you and the boat you rode in

on.  Sir.

THE CHIEF

(to instructors)

We're done here.

JORDAN

Make you a deal, Flea.  Never tell

me how I look -- and I'll never tell

you.

THE CHIEF

You don't think she'd be raped if

she were captured?  You don't think

the threat of rape would be used to

leverage the men?

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

You broke a dozen training rules

back there -- before I lost count.

THE CHIEF

I've had it.  Just because they pay

me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean

I'm gonna be one.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

She's a trainee, just like the

others.  Why are you coming down so

hard?

THE CHIEF

She's an officer.  There's a higher

standard.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

She's a women, and that's why you're

ridin' her bareback.

THE CHIEF

Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay

on her until everyone realizes this

is not some bullshit equal-rights

thing, that real lives are gonna be

lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

I oughtta report you.

THE CHIEF

I think you probably would -- if you

didn't know I was right.

DEHAVEN

Yes?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)

(anxious)

Did you hear?

DEHAVEN

She made it through S.E.R.E.

training.  Got a call this morning

from --

DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)

Not that.  The White House just

announced that it was sponsoring

legislation that would, in one

stroke, void all remaining elements

of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)

You there?  Senator?

HAYES

Without telling us they do this?

With absolutely no lead time?

FLAG OFFICER #1

(to Hayes)

Mr. Secretary, if this bill

passes...

FLAG OFFICER #2

Forget our three-year plan.  They're

rushing the cadence.  We'll be

forced to reorganize the Navy from

top to bottom -- overnight.

HAYES

What the hell is the President

trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's

thunder?

FLAG OFFICER #1

I think it's more important, sir, to

decide what we're going to do --

since it's apparent this issue is

not going away quietly.

HAYES

"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you

told me she wouldn't last a week?

Huh?

HAYES

20 years in the Pentagon, I finally

rate an office with a window -- and

it looks out over the world's

largest graveyard.  Think it's a

sign?

JORDAN

Sorry, didn't mean to --

WICKWIRE

That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend.

And know I remember why.

JORDAN

First big night of liberty and no

date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.

WICKWIRE

Maybe I'll just head over to McP's

with the others, have a drink or

four.  Don't wanna come, do you?

JORDAN

(touching bruises)

I can't go out.  Not like this.

WICKWIRE

I think you look beautiful.

JORDAN

Thanks for lying.  But you're the

class officer, Wick, and it'd just

be weird if we hook up.  Besides...

BLONDELL

Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano

and...

JORDAN

Do you, uh, know...

WICKWIRE

Sure, sure.

JORDAN

We're going over to her place to

make salad and pasta.  Just, you

know, nothing special.

WICKWIRE

Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

... underwater detonation devices

employ mechanical timers, and as

such, they are subject to variances

due to water temperature.  That's

why when clearing mines, we always

use two timers.  The charts now

being passed out contain

calculations you must memorize

before...

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

O'Neil?

JORDAN

Sir?

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS

You're wanted at the C.O.'s.

YEOMAN

This way, lieutenant.  They're

expecting you.

JORDAN

See me, sir?

C.O.

(uncomfortable)

I don't know of any delicate way to

say this, lieutenant, so I won't

try.  Claims have been made that you

have engaged in fraternization -- of

the same-sex variety.  Specifically,

that you were...

(reading)

"... seen leaving the apartment of

another female officer at such a

time and in such a manner as to

suggest conduct unbecoming."

JORDAN

(a beat,laughing in

relief)

Sir, if someone is suggesting that

I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

JORDAN

They're very wrong.  And I'd like to

know where you got this information.

WICKWIRE

I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class

officer, it's my obligation to

report all violations.

JORDAN

This is insane.  You've got no

proof.

X.O.

(from report)

You were seen leaving Ensign

Blondell's apartment at

approximately 0-200, whereupon

physical affections were exchanged

in public.

JORDAN

We hugged.

X.O.

In addition, you have been seen

frequenting the base exchange, the

mess hall, the --

JORDAN

Because the men didn't want me

eating with them.  Jesus Christ,

let's get this right.

C.O.

That's enough.  Everybody.

(to Wickwire)

Rejoin your class, lieutenant.

WICKWIRE

(only to Jordan)

I wish I didn't have to do this,

Jordan.

C.O.

Dismissed, lieutenant.

JORDAN

Sir, I just want you to know that

this is either a gross mistake --

or someone's vindictive bullshit.

In no way did anything happen

between Ensign Blondell and myself.

We're just friends.

X.O.

So you're saying the charges have no

validity whatsoever?

JORDAN

I'm saying, we're just friends.

C.O.

I find this as distasteful as you,

lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk,

it's on my shoulders.  There's going

to be an inquiry -- it will not be

quick and it will definitely not be

pretty.  You should prepare

yourself.

JORDAN

Sir, please... if there's any way to

do this without dragging everyone

through the mud...

C.O.

I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

JORDAN

(turning back)

Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under

your command... would the inquiry

still go forward?

C.O.

I'm not sure what --

JORDAN

Would you have the discretion to end

it right then and there?

C.O.

I believe so.

MCCOOL

So what'd he want?  O'Neil?

FLEA

Oh, no... no, no, no, no...

THE CHIEF

Stand fast!

FADE OUT.

ROYCE

(in her ear)

I want to kill them... I want to

kill the guys who made you cry like

this...

JORDAN

All I wanted was an honest chance.

And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't

stay.

ROYCE

And this class officer...

"Wickwire."  You think he was just

trying to get even?  Striking back

for...

JORDAN

Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like

he was getting any satisfaction out

of it.  Almost like...

(a beat)

Did I say he was class officer?

ROYCE

Almost like someone put him up to

it.  Okay, who?

JORDAN

No shortage of suspects.

ROYCE

The Chief?  Or maybe even

Turrentine?  Your C.O.?

JORDAN

Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a

file on me.

ROYCE

Somebody was yankin' your stings,

Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles

away.  I wanted to know who.  I still

do.

ROYCE

C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with

me.

JORDAN

It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.

ROYCE

Someone screwed you over like this,

left unanswered charges hanging over

your head, and you're not gonna

fight back?

JORDAN

I'm tired of fighting back.  I just

wanted to come home and be safe and

have you here and the river there

and just forget the rest of the

world, okay?

ROYCE

Well, before you crawl off to die,

Jordan, give me five minutes of good

headwork.

ROYCE

(pulling a file)

"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.

JORDAN

What about him.

JORDAN

Instructors typically pull three

year assignments.  This guy's in and

out in one year -- your year.  That

sound right?

JORDAN

Sounds like an amazing coincidence.

ROYCE

Or like maybe he was baby sitting a

problem child for the Navy.

JORDAN

I don't know, I don't care.

ROYCE

Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who

else?  Who could've leveraged a

class officer like that?  C'mon,

Jordan, keep your head in the game.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)

... just got word today.  The

Senator wants you to know that she's

disturbed by the matter, and she'll

be looking into it carefully to make

sure you were treated fairly.  If

you need to reach us, we're here in

Washington, 202-224-3121.

JORDAN

"In Washington..."

ROYCE

What?

JORDAN

Wickwire said he was dry-docked in

Washington between stints at

Coronado...

ROYCE

"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second

run at Coronado... and correct, they

had him stashed in the

"Appropriation Liaison Office,"

whatever that is.

JORDAN

You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and

get another shot without

dispensation from someone up in flag

country.

(a revelation)

He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.

ROYCE

I'd sure like to know who.

JORDAN

Yeah.  Me too.

BLONDELL

Administration, Ensign Blondell.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Don't say my name.

BLONDELL

Who's...

(brightening)

Lieuten --

JORDAN (V.O.)

Or rank.  But can you do me a favor

and pull a transfer order?

BLONDELL

Okay, but... You didn't have to do

what you did.  Not for me.

JORDAN (V.O.)

(appreciative)

"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what

you can find.

CUT TO:

BLONDELL

Got it.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Who signed as his "sponsoring

officer"?

BLONDELL

Uh... don't see it.  There's no

signature.  But hang on -- there's a

note to "See Addendum."  Checking...

BLONDELL

Wow...

JORDAN (V.O.)

What'd you find, Kathy?

MATCH CUT TO:

D.C. COP

Don't even dream about leaving that

vehicle there.

ROYCE

Government car -- tow it if you

want.  Just point us to DeHaven's

office first.

ROYCE

Capt'n.

NAVY CAPTAIN

Commander.

ROYCE

(to Jordan)

Get started here.  I'll catch up.

SECRETARY

Your name again?

JORDAN

Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

Ms. O'Neil.  Yes, of course.  I'm

Douglas Champeau.  Unfortunately,

the Senator is in chamber right now.

How can I help you?

JORDAN

What chamber?  Which way is that?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

I mean, she's on the floor of the

Senate.

JORDAN

Okay, which way?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

She really can't be disturbed.  But

if you care to wait, I'll find you

an office with a phone.  It might be

several hours, but --

TOURIST

'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up

gallery tickets?  Are you...

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

See the secretary, please.

JORDAN (O.S.)

Senator DeHaven...

JORDAN

DeHaven...

JORDAN

We can talk here or we can talk

outside, Senator.  You tell me.

DEHAVEN

Cloak room.  I'll meet her there.

Just her.

DEHAVEN

Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get

together -- though just now I'm

gearing up for a child-care vote

that --

JORDAN

Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

JORDAN

You know him.

DEHAVEN

Sounds familiar.

JORDAN

It should.  You nominated him for

Spec-Recon just three days after you

nominated me.

DEHAVEN

Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch

tomorrow?  I do very much want to

talk, but now is scarcely --

JORDAN

Did you set me up?  Did you set me

up just to see me fail?

DEHAVEN

Absolutely not.

DEHAVEN

Wickwire was there to help.  To be

my eyes on the inside, to make sure

you were getting a fair shot.  At

least that was the intent.

JORDAN

What changed?

DEHAVEN

Should probably ask him that.

JORDAN

If I have to ask again, Senator,

I'll be asking in front of cameras.

DOORKEEPER

Madam Senator?  Your esteemed

colleagues are requesting --

DEHAVEN

Two seconds, Walter.

(answering Jordan)

In 1981, the Supreme Court was

asked to rule on the issue of women

in combat positions.  The Court

cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws

as a legal foundation for keeping

women ineligible.  That decision

held for all these years -- until

the White House, 10 days ago, moved

to have the Exclusion Laws voided.

To demolish that legal foundation.

JORDAN

So?  Isn't the President jumping on

your bandwagon?

DEHAVEN

What he did was light the bandwagon

on fire.  Because he knows what I

know -- that American families are

not prepared to put their daughters

in harm's way.

JORDAN

You don't know that.

DEHAVEN

In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,

Gallop -- they all come back the

same.

JORDAN

What are you saying?  That a women's

life is more valuable than a man's?

That a women's death hurts a family

more?

DEHAVEN

I'm saying it's not going to happen.

Not when the President is set to

turn this into a third-rail issue

should I choose to ever campaign

against him.  He will fry me six

ways to Sunday for sending daughters

and young mothers off to war -- and,

quite possibly, for bringing them

back in body bags.

JORDAN

You were never going to let women

serve in combat.  You always had a

safety net.  Or thought you did.

DEHAVEN

Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully

understand this -- but sometimes

there's more to be gained from the

fight than the victory.

JORDAN

So the rhetoric gets you headlines.

But the reality gets you in trouble.

DEHAVEN

The reality is this:  We send far

too many men off to war.  I don't

need to compound the problem with

women.

(off Jordan's look)

Can you honestly tell me you wanted

that life?  Squat-pissing in some

third-world jungle with --

JORDAN

I wanted the choice.  The chance to

prove myself, my skills, my work,

me.  That's how it should've been.

DOORKEEPER

Madam Senator, once again I must --

DEHAVEN

Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter.

DEHAVEN

I once promised you a fast ticket,

Jordan, and I always meant to make

good on that.  Come work for me.  I

can always use a hard-charger on my

team.

JORDAN

You promise Wickwire a fast ticket,

too?

DEHAVEN

I've had no direct communication

with him since this whole thing

began.  And that's quite verifiable.

JORDAN

I'm sure it is.

DEHAVEN

You'll think about my offer?

JORDAN

You know, I wonder what the SecNav

would think about it.  If I spoke

with him.

DEHAVEN

Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this

morning myself -- and told him the

deal was off.  No more test cases.

He was only too happy to oblige.

(dangerously low)

Don't play politics with me, little

darlin'.  You'd be up way past your

bedtime.

DOORKEEPER

(distraught)

Madam Senator, please...

DEHAVEN

I'll call you in a few days.

JORDAN

So I wonder what the President would

think.

C.O.

Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it

would be impossible, sir, just...

Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can

appreciate that, sir.  Good night,

sir.

C.O.

Well, if you had to go over my

head, lieutenant, that's the way to

do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200

call from the Commander and Chief to

get the bowels movin'.

JORDAN

Sir?  What did he say?

C.O.

Basically -- he asked me if I could

unring a bell.

C.O.

(to class)

One of you here understands better

than anyone what this is all about.

Someone who has engaged in conduct

unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I

would hope, what he must now do.

C.O.

And unless that someone takes the

honorable way out in the next 10

seconds -- I will make certain he

faces action under the Uniform Code

of Military Justice.

JORDAN

Just walk away and never stop.

C.O.

It seems we have an opening for

class officer.  Any nominations?

C.O.

All those in favor?

C.O.

Chief Urgayle, turning it back over

to you.

THE CHIEF

Well, I'm trying to figure out if

you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous

-- or some new alloy of all three.

JORDAN

Good to see you again, too, sir.

THE CHIEF

Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed

all the others.  Now try me.

THE CHIEF

(setting watch)

Four... three... two... one... hack!

THE CHIEF

Final assignment!  Each crew will be

dropped 12 miles out!  Between you

and the shore is a network of mines

and underwater obstacles!  You will

clear the obstacles, you will tag

the mines with your crew number!

You have until 18-hundred to make

landfall!

THE CHIEF

Remember!  The one thing you can

count on in any mission is that

anything mechanical will fail!  If

you get stuck out here, do not call

me, for you will no longer be in my

class!  Try the Coast Guard!

JORDAN

(to her crew)

One-second intervals!  Go!

FLEA

C'mon, c'mon...

CORTEZ

This tank's not gonna cut it, el-

tee.  Handle's stripped.

SLUTNIK

I just wonder how that happened.

JORDAN

Cortez, see if you can dig out the

tools without losing the rest of out

gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.

THE CHIEF

What happening?!

PILOT

Fucking pelicans!  Hang on!

PILOT

Holy... LET'S GYRATE!

MCCOOL

What the shit is...

SLUTNIK

You don't suppose this is just part

of...

JORDAN

FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT!

Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the

hell you waiting for?

JORDAN

Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We

have a downed helo 12 miles west-

south west of base with three

aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed

helo with three aboard...

CUT TO:

FLEA

CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE!

FLEA

Close as I can get, el-tee!

JORDAN

Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take

your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

JORDAN

Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What

is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo?

Over.

BASE (V.O.)

Crew Leader, we have a Medevac

rerouting from Long Beach, but no

other helos prepped at this time.

Seafox One and Two are launching

now.  Over.

JORDAN

Base, don't think you copied me.  We

are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out

at 30 knots, which makes it a no-

show for 18 minutes.  Over.

BASE (V.O.)

You copied right, Crew Leader.

We're looking for options ourselves.

SLUTNIK

Maybe we should call the Coast

Guard.

JORDAN

Shut your hole, Slutnik.

CUT TO:

MCCOOL

Visibility drops dead at 40 feet.

If they're deeper than that...

CORTEZ

Nobody's comin' outta that crash,

el-tee.  Nobody.

THE CHIEF (V.O.)

Base, this is Basher One.  I've got

a small problem here.  Do you copy?

JORDAN

(into radio)

Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are

barely reading you.  What is your

situation?

THE CHIEF

Got one other heartbeat here, looks

touch and go.  I've got a

questionable leg.

THE CHIEF (V.O.)

Managed to activate the ELB.  If you

just radio base and let them know,

they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make

sure they send a helo with a winch

-- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.

JORDAN

Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be

here for 15 minutes.  What's your

air situation?  Over.

THE CHIEF (V.O.)

Say again?  How many micks?

JORDAN

15, sir.

THE CHIEF

(into radio)

That... may not be adequate.

FLEA

If we could just fix on him...

MCCOOL

Beacon's a no-go for us.

JORDAN

(into radio)

Chief -- did I see a flare box

aboard?  And can you get at it?

Over.

THE CHIEF (V.O.)

Got it.

JORDAN

(into radio)

Show us where you are, Chief.

FLEA

Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!

JORDAN

Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to

slip you some air, so we're coming

down with a tank -- just something

until the A-team shows.  Over.

JORDAN

Chief?

CHIEF (V.O.)

O'Neil... there's no air in your

main tanks.

MCCOOL

What?

THE CHIEF

(into radio)

This mission wasn't about tagging

mines.  It was to see how you coped

with mechanical failures.  Pretty

fuckin' ironic, huh?

SLUTNIK

He's circlin' the drain, el-tee.

JORDAN

So we got two full mini-tanks, three

minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air

in yours?

MCCOOL

Maybe half.  Not even.

JORDAN

Grab an oar, find a way to weight it

down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez,

help him.  Flea?  You take one of the

two full minis -- and just follow my

lead.

CORTEZ

What, we're gonna pry 'em out with

paddles?

MCCOOL

(grabbing her)

O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as

soon as we get down there.  You know

that, don't you?

JORDAN

So I guess we get one shot at it.

THE CHIEF

Why'd it have to be her...

JORDAN

Chief, sir... still with me?

CHIEF

(unbuckling co-pilot)

Take him first.  Once he's clear,

come back with --

JORDAN

Sir, let me suggest you stop giving

orders and start doing exactly what

I say, because that's the only way

we're all getting out of here.  Now

how's your vest check out?  Still

good?

JORDAN

Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed

him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are

gonna take the express elevator

outta here.  Remember to let your

air out.  Ready?

THE CHIEF

(growling)

O'Neil...

JORDAN

Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

MCCOOL

Hoooooo-yah!

NEWBERRY

Go, go, go, go!

SLUTNIK

Uh-huh!  That's right!  Just like we

always practice it!

DISSOLVE TO:

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

Senator DeHaven is here for the

graduation ceremonies.

BASE GUARD

What are all these other vehicles?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

Just a small press corps.  Routine.

BASE GUARD

And that pickup truck at the end?

DEHAVEN'S AIDE

That?  That would be the all-woman

America's Cup team.

C.O.

(into microphone)

Special Reconnaissance Class 118,

you may now stand down.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Lieutenant?  I was asked to give you

this.

JORDAN

The Navy Cross...

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

I believe he earned it for saving a

man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He

wanted you to have it.  He was very

clear on that point.

JORDAN

I was looking for him earlier,

but...

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

The Chief was granted early

retirement as of 17-hundred

yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was

gone.  Out of the Navy.

JORDAN

(knowing better)

Just a coincidence?

INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Maybe it's not my place to speculate

on his private thoughts.  But I

think the Chief knew that his way --

his world -- had come and gone.

CUT TO:

DEHAVEN

... of course, we always prefer

peace to war.  But if we're going to

war, give women a piece.  Give them

the choice to defend their country.

And if the President doesn't like

that idea -- if he wants to continue

to deny women their equal rights --

then I'll be happy to step out back

with him any time, anywhere...

DEHAVEN

Jordan?  Jordan, dear...

C.O.

Senator, perhaps this would be a

good time for that lunch.  Will the

America's Cup team be joining us?

JORDAN

So here we are again.  Staring three

years of operational duty in the

face.

ROYCE

Look.  It's not like you'd be

completely out of reach.  And maybe

we could call in a few favors, get

you stationed at Norfolk instead of

Coronado.  There are ways of dealing

with these things -- I mean, if

people are so inclined.

JORDAN

(warily)

Which is guy-speak for...

ROYCE

"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no

matter how long."

FADE OUT.

THE END
