THE WONDER BOYS

WONDER BOYS

BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON

Screenplay/Steve Kloves

GRADY

'The young girl sat perfectly still in the

confessional...

1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

GRADY

...listening to her father's boots scrape like

chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then

grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

GRADY (cont'd)

(a wave of the pages)

So. .Anyone?

CARRIE MCWHIRTY

Let me get this straight. The girl with the

big lips is depressed because, each night, when

her father goes off to work at the bakery, her

mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the

house. Not only does this girl have to listen

to her mother working this guy in the next

room, she has to wash the sheets each morning

before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of

this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy

takes her to confession--only, once she gets in

the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and

realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is

that it?

CARRIE MCWHIRTY

I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

GRADY

All right. Let's try to keep it constructive,

shall we? Howard, what about you?

HOWARD

I hated it.

GRADY

That's not exactly what I meant by

constructive, Howard.

HOWARD

I think James should try to be more

constructive. This is my second semester with

him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me

want to kill myself.

GRADY

Yes, Hannah?

HANNAH GREEN

I think maybe we're missing the point. It

seems to me James' strength as a writer is that

he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us

like adults. He respects us enough to forget

us. That takes . . . courage .

GRADY

Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I

think.

(as the students rise)

Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And

remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to

tonight's cocktail party need to have them at

the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

GRADY

Thanks for that. He all right?

HANNAH GREEN

I think so. ..What about you?

GRADY

Me? Sure. Why?

HANNAH GREEN

Just checking.

JAMES LEER

Turn out the light, please.

2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

SARA

(calm but firm)

No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for

today. This means we have no programs for the

weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at

9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw

Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are

going.

(shaking her head)

It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

SARA

Professor Tripp.

GRADY

Chancellor.

SARA

I got the message you called.

GRADY

I got the message you called too.

3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

4	EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH

5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

CRABTREE

Tripp!

GRADY

How are you, Crabtree?

CRABTREE

Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss

Antonia. . .uh. . . .

WOMAN

Sloviak.

CRABTREE

I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to

tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you.

Trip? ?

GRADY

(a slight beat)

The more the merrier.

MISS SLOVIAK

Terry was telling me about you on the plane.

It was ail so interesting.

CRABTREE

I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes

to be published. What you do as a writer, what

I do as an editor...

GRADY

I sweat blood for five years and he checks for

spelling.

MISS SLOVIAK

(indicating Crabtree)

That's exactly what he said.

CRABTREE

We know each other pretty well.

(to Grady)

So where's Emily?

GRADY

Emily?

CRABTREE

Your wife.

GRADY

Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

CRABTREE

Perfect. Well then, shall we?

7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

CRABTREE

Do you know how many times I've boarded an

airplane praying someone like her would sit

down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my

way to Pittsburgh.

GRADY

Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great

cities.

CRABTREE

If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no

argument from me.

GRADY

She's a transvestite.

CRABTREE

You're stoned.

GRADY

She's still a transvestite.

CRABTREE

Mm.

GRADY

Isn't she?

CRABTREE

So how's the book?

GRADY

It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort

of. ..tinkering with it.

CRABTREE

Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it

sometime this weekend. Think that might be

possible?

GRADY

I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . .

juncture .

CRABTREE

I thought you were tinkering.

GRADY

I just mean. . .

CRABTREE

Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you,

Tripp. But...

(pointedly)

...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

CRABTREE

Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would

be?

GRADY

That would be a tuba.

8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

GRADY

That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It

wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

MISS SLOVIAK

Why yes. How did you know?

GRADY

Lucky guess.

CRABTREE

You didn't actually purchase this car, did

you. Trip??

GRADY

It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

CRABTREE

He owes God money. You know, he queered

himself for good with Esquire.

GRADY

He said something about being between things.

CRABTREE

Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken

legs.

9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

GRADY

Hi, Tanya.

(to the others)

This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

TANYA

Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

TANYA (cont'd)

Is there anything I can do for you?

GRADY

You're leaking, Tanya.

CRABTREE

Trip? ?

GRADY

She left me. Crabs.

CRABTREE

Left you...?  Who? Emily?

GRADY

This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

CRABTREE

But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I

mean, what are we doing here?

GRADY

I thought maybe I made it all up.

10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING

MISS SLOVIAK

That's a nice greenhouse.

GRADY

It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

CRABTREE

I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby,

Tripp.

GRADY

Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

CRABTREE

Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always

do.

11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE

SARA

Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you

again.

CRABTREE

Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

SARA

Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to

wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

GRADY

Easy there.

SARA

I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't

know how anyone actually walks in these things.

MISS SLOVIAK

Practice.

SARA

I don't believe we've met...

MISS SLOVIAK

Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

SARA

Poe!

CRABTREE

(mildly)

This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

MISS SLOVIAK

Who ' s he barking at now?

GRADY

He's still barking at me. He's blind.

SARA

Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

GRADY

I need to talk to you.

SARA

That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.

(strategy in her tone)

Perhaps you could put some of these coats in

the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

GRADY

(reading her)

I don't believe I know where the upstairs

guest room is.

SARA

Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

CRABTREE

We'll just make ourselves at home.

(kneeling by Poe)

Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM

GRADY

New?

SARA

(nodding)

Walter just got it back from the framer today.

SARA

You go first.

GRADY

All right. This morning--

SARA

I'm pregnant.

SARA

I'm sure.

GRADY

Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

SARA

I think Walter would find this a little more

than surprising.

GRADY

Emily left me this morning.

SARA

She's left before...

GRADY

She's left the room before. She always came

back.

SARA

So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry

each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

GRADY

Simple.

SARA

Is that Cristaile?

GRADY

Hm.

SARA

(weary)

My God, I wear the same scent as a

transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't:

she?

GRADY

If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is

by the end of the evening.

SARA

Has he asked to see the book yet?

GRADY

Yes.

SARA

And? Are you going to tell him?

GRADY

No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm

going to do.

SARA

(distantly)

Neither do 1.

GRADY

Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

SARA

I guess you're going to have to chew it off

then.

13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE

CRABTREE

Walter! I see you've met my friend.

WALTER GASKELL

Yes . She' s charming.

MISS SLOVIAK

(taking her drink)

Walter's been telling me the most fascinating

things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

WALTER GASKELL

Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my

contention that their marriage tapped into the

very id of American popular culture. Joe

DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking,

the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be

controversial, I personally believe every

woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn

Monroe.

MISS SLOVIAK

Oh, I couldn't agree more.

Q

And while my latest has been on the New York

Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't

help but lament that my first book, which

contains what I consider my finest writing, was

remaindered in less than five. So, I find

myself conflicted.

GRADY

Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in

the Hamptons.

HANNAH GREEN

(brightening)

Grady.

Q

Hello.. .Professor.

GRADY

Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The

Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A'

material for her.

MAN IN TWEED

(to short man)

A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm

telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob

laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa?

Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot

bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.

(as GRADY passes)

Grady!

GRADY

Hello, Nathan.

MAN IN TWEED

My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The

PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for

you, Grady.

(to his friend)

GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

SHORT MAN

Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I

say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon

of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it

on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years

running.

GRADY

(pulling away)

No wonder it's still in print.

WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE

...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy

fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to

deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover

the cancer in your heart every time, but God

forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT

MAN'S VOICE

There you are.

WALTER

I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in

here. You haven't seen it, have you?

SARA

I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if

I was sitting on it.

WALTER

You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

SARA

I doubt it, darling.

WALTER

(angling & bottle to the light)

Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he

will be addressing 500 people in little over an

hour...

SARA

You want to keep him happy.

WALTER

If he' s happy. . .

(kissing her as he exits)

I'm happy.

GRADY

James?

JAMES LEER

It's fake.

JAMES LEER

It was my mother's. She won it in a penny

arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic

school.

GRADY

It's very convincing.

JAMES LEER

It used to shoot these little paper caps, but

they don't make them anymore. The caps.

JAMES LEER

It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry

rabbits' feet...

GRADY

...You carry firearms.

JAMES LEER

No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of

my emotions.

JAMES LEER

I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were

wondering. I crashed. I mean, not

intentionally...

JAMES LEER (cont'd)

...but the other night, Hannah and I were

together, at the movies, and she asked me.

Since she was coming. So I ended up coming.

Too.

GRADY

Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

JAMES LEER

No! What gave you that idea?

GRADY

Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent

her a room.

JAMES LEER

She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.

(glancing back at the window)

Besides, she doesn't really know me. She

thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's

because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

GRADY

Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she

knows it and try as she might to not let that

screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in

some way.

JAMES LEER

You're not like my other teachers, Professor

Tripp.

GRADY

You're not like my other students, James. So

what was the movie you two saw?

JAMES LEER

Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and

Frances Farmer.

GRADY

She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

JAMES LEER

So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

GRADY

Sounds like a good one.

JAMES LEER

(a crooked smile)

It's not bad.

GRADY

Listen, James, about this afternoon. In

workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a

bit out of control.

JAMES LEER

They really hated it. I think they hated it

more than any of the other ones.

GRADY

Well...

JAMES LEER

It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to

write.

GRADY

(truly impressed)

Really? That's remarkable.

JAMES LEER

I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in

bed I figure them out. The stories.

GRADY

You cold, James?

JAMES LEER

(distant)

A little.

GRADY

So what are you doing out here?

JAMES LEER

It's colder in there. -

GRADY

(laughing)

You're right.

JAMES LEER

Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought

...I thought I'd come out here and take a look

at it. You don't see one of those every day. It

looks like heaven...

GRADY

Heaven?

JAMES LEER

I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in

heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in

crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the

way I remember it...

JAMES LEER

I should be going.

JAMES LEER (cont'd)

Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

GRADY

James.

(as he stops)

Don't leave just yet. There's something I

think you ought to see.

JAMES LEER

I'll miss my bus.

GRADY

This is worth it.

GRADY (cont'd)

Trust me.

15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

HANNAH GREEN

Hey, you two.

HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)

Are you riding with me, James?

JAMES LEER

No, I'm going ho--

GRADY

He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his

friend. All right?

HANNAH GREEN

Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

GRADY

The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know.

Where are they exactly?

CRABTREE

Here we are!

CRABTREE

(spying James)

Nell, hello there.

GRADY

James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

HANNAH GREEN

James'll know about George Sanders.

JAMES LEER

George Sanders?

HANNAH GREEN

Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders

killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

JAMES LEER

Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel

room.

CRABTREE

How comprehensive of you.

HANNAH GREEN

Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie

suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

JAMES LEER

There's so many...

HANNAH GREEN

Just a few then. The big ones.

JAMES LEER

Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles

Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth,

1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an

accident, but, you know. . .

(a trace of irony)

He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took

pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he

hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in

lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more

pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget

when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot

himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979.

Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret

Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.

Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in

1978. There are more but I don't know if you

would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara

Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

HANNAH GREEN

I haven't heard of half of those.

CRABTREE

You did them alphabetically.

JAMES LEER

That's just how my brain works, I guess.

CRABTREE

Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out

with us after the lecture. There's a place on

the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

JAMES LEER

Actually. ..I just want to go home.

CRABTREE

Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants

to go home. Besides, faculty will be present.

Just think of it as a field trip.

16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE

JAMES LEER

Is that really it?

GRADY

That's really it.

JAMES LEER

The one she wore on her wedding day?

GRADY

So I'm told.

GRADY

(cont'd)

Go ahead.

JAMES LEER

Really?

GRADY

Really.

JAMES LEER

They're glass. The buttons.

GRADY

Like the lady herself.

JAMES LEER

She was small. Most people don't know that.

The shoulders are small.

(touching the satin)

It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time

she wore it. That day. She must've felt so

...happy.

JAMES LEER

It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or...

something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

GRADY

I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth

about how much he pays for these things.

JAMES LEER

You're really good friends with the

Chancellor, aren't you?

GRADY

(carefully)

Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell,

too.

JAMES LEER

I guess you must be, if you know the

combination to his closet and he doesn't mind

your being here in their bedroom like this.

GRADY

Right.

GRADY

We, better skedaddle. Close that closet--

James? You ail right?

JAMES LEER

I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing

that jacket that belonged to her. It just

looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a

closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

GRADY

Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself

tonight.

JAMES LEER

You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?

(off Grady's look)

Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a

note.

GRADY

Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we

should go now.

17	INT. HALLWAY

GRADY

Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

GRADY

Jesus!

GRADY

Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

GRADY

Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

JAMES LEER

I had to. Didn't I?

GRADY

Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

JAMES LEER

No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1

thought --

GRADY

Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on

me.

JAMES LEER

Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see

if someone's breathing.

GRADY

He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead

dog when I see one.

JAMES LEER

What are we going to do?

GRADY

First you're going to give me that little cap

gun of yours.

18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

JAMES LEER

Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

GRADY

Yea, James.

JAMES LEER

What are we going to do with...

GRADY

I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out

how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her

husband's dog.

JAMES LEER

You?

GRADY

Trust me, James, when the family pet's been

assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear

one of her students was the triggerman.

JAMES LEER

Does she want to hear it was one of her

professors?

GRADY

I've got tenure.

19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS)

GRADY

Okay.

JAMES LEER

He's still a little warm.

JAMES LEER

Yuck.

JAMES LEER

That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a

suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost

perfectly.

GRADY

(searching)

That's just what they used to say in the ads.

Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

JAMES LEER

Whose tuba is that anyway?

GRADY

Miss Sloviak's.

JAMES LEER

Can I ask you something about her?

GRADY

She is. Ah. Here we go...

JAMES LEER

Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--

gay?

GRADY

Most of the time he is, James. Some of the

time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

GRADY

Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That

should take the pinch out of my ankle.

(handing the bottle to James)

Have one.

JAMES LEER

No thanks. I'm fine without them.

GRADY

Right. That's why you were standing in the

Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap

gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right,

you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

GRADY

I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

GRADY

How 'bout we try that again.

20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

WALTER

...really needs no introduction. Walk down the

aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any

hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at

you. You all know the name, you all know the

books, so welcome if you will, the man those of

us who know him simply call.. .Q.

Q

Good evening.

Q

I am a writer.

Q (cont'd)

As a writer, one thing you learn is that

everyone you encounter has a story. Every

bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an

idea or a. story that would make a "great book"

or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has

an idea. (gestures to the audience)

But, how do you go from there to here? How do

you go from having an idea to having a book?

How do you get across? What is the bridge, the

bridge that allows you to walk on air from the

shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of

accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is

worth the telling, faith that you have the

wherewithal to tell it, faith that the

carefully woven structure you create won't

collapse beneath you...

Q (cont'd)

...and faith that when you get to the other

side someone will be waiting who gives a damn

about the tale you have to tell.

GRADY

I'll be right back.

SARA'S VOICE

Grady? Grady?

SARA

You had another one, didn't you? You have to

see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday

morning. All right?

GRADY

Is the thing-is it over?

SARA

Almost. Wane to sit up?

(as he winces)

What's the matter?

GRADY

Nothing. I think I twisted my--

GRADY

I have to tell you something. Something..

.hard.

SARA

Then stand up. I'm too old for all this

roiling around on the floor.

GRADY

Well...

SARA

Don't. I know what you're going to say.

GRADY

No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

SARA

You love Emily. I know that. And you need to

stay with her.

GRADY

I don't think I really have a choice in, that.

Emily left me.

SARA

She'll come back. That's why I'm going to.

..to not have this baby.

GRADY

Not have it.

SARA

No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think

there's no way?

GRADY

Well, no, I don't see any way.

(taking her hand)

And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose

this chance.

SARA

(jerking away)

No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do.

And fuck you for "saying. . .

(quietly)

...for saying there's just no way. Because

there could be a way, Grady.

SARA

(composing herself)

He must be finishing. We should go.

SARA

Who's gun is that?

GRADY

It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

SARA

Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

GRADY

Caps.

SARA

Pow.

GRADY

You got me.

SARA

I love you, Grady.

GRADY

I love you, too.

Woah! The doors made so much noise!

JAMES LEER

This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry

me out.

GRADY

Is he ail right?

CRABTREE

He's fine. He's narrating.

JAMES LEER

We're going to the men's room. Only we might

not make it in time.

SARA

Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you

to make that mistake, wait here.

I need a ride.

GRADY

I'm your man.

MISS SLOVIAK

Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the

GRADY

James is. ..I don't know...

MISS SLOVIAK

Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets

done with him, he's going to be even more

disturbed.

GRADY

I'm not sure that's possible.

MISS SLOVIAK

Sure it is.

GRADY

Listen, Antonia--

MISS SLOVIAK

Tony. Now that I'm home.

GRADY

Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so

well for you tonight. With Terry.

MISS SLOVIAK

Forget it. I should've known better. Your

friend is just, I don't know, into collecting

weird tricks. Mind?

GRADY

He's writing his name in water.

MISS SLOVIAK

What's that?

GRADY

Like most editors, he really wants to be a

writer, but he's too busy living a novel to

bother writing one.

MISS SLOVIAK

That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a

shit.

GRADY

He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the

feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

MISS SLOVIAK

You mean because his career's ruined and all?

GRADY

Jesus. Is that what he told you?

MISS SLOVIAK

He said he hasn't had a success in ten years

and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of

.a. . .

MISS SLOVIAK

...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good

that he'll be able to keep his job.

MISS SLOVIAK

(cont'd)

Turn here.

26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

GRADY

That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese

beetle trap.

MISS SLOVIAK

It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

MISS SLOVIAK

There's Pop.

(turning)

Let me see it. The gun.

MISS SLOVIAK

Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis

would carry. In a little beaded purse?

GRADY

I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue

James Leer.

MISS SLOVIAK

You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think

about going home. You look like you need a

little rescuing yourself.

GRADY

Is that just beer?

CRABTREE

Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a

little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You

missed a few bottles, by the way.

GRADY

I'm sure. Where is everyone?

CRABTREE

Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to

go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

GRADY

Jesus. He's out.

CRABTREE

He has a book.

GRADY

I know. He started it Fall semester.

CRABTREE

He finished it Winter Break.

CRABTREE

So. Is he any good?

GRADY

No. Not yet he isn't.

CRABTREE

Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

GRADY

Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o

my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure

if he's-

CRABTREE

He is. Take my word for it.

GRADY

I think it's more complicated than that.

Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost

...did something stupid tonight. At least, I

think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual

confusion thrown into the stew right now.

CRABTREE

On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

WAITRESS

(ducking in)

Double Dickel.

GRADY

Thanks.

CRABTREE

No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

GRADY

Shut up and drink.

CRABTREE

Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

GRADY

President of the James Brown Hair Club For

Men.

GRADY

(initiating an old game)

He's a boxer. A flyweight.

CRABTREE

Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis..

.Curtis Hardapple.

GRADY

Not Curtis.

CRABTREE

Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are

from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and

got trampled.

GRADY

And now he's addicted to painkillers.

CRABTREE

He can't piss standing up anymore.

GRADY

He lives with his mother.

CRABTREE

And he had a younger brother who . . .was . .

. a. . .

GRADY

Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames

Vernon for his death.

CRABTREE

(stumped)

Because. . .because. . .

JAMES LEER

(sleepily)

.. .he was killed, when a gangster named

Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite

horse. He took the bullet himself.

JAMES LEER

Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

CRABTREE

That was good.

GRADY

He heard everything we were saying.

HANNAH GREEN

Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

HANNAH GREEN

I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's

so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail

your sentences always existed, just waiting

around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to

fetch them down.

GRADY

I thank you.

HANNAH GREEN

And I love the inscription you wrote to me.

Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think

I am.

GRADY

I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy

innocents we can get.

HANNAH GREEN

So what are you going to do?

GRADY

Do?

HANNAH GREEN

I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to

be there when you get home.

GRADY

Are you holding me up or am I dragging you

down?

HANNAH GREEN

Shush.

31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)

GRADY

Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make

sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

HANNAH GREEN

I would if I knew where I was taking him.

GRADY

Hannah, are you telling me you don't know

where James Leer lives?

HANNAH GREEN

Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen

it.

GRADY

That strikes me as odd.

HANNAH GREEN

James is odd. I know he has an aunt in

Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once,

but...

(remembering)

Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's

house. He said she worked there. Or something.

I don't remember.

JAMES LEER

Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

GRADY

What's he saying?

HANNAH GREEN

His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's

always carrying around. He must've left it

inside.

GRADY

Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

GRADY

Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the

auditorium.

JAMES LEER

(delirious, but insistent)

Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

GRADY (cont'd)

All right. Take him to my place. He can crash

on the sofa.

HANNAH GREEN

The one in your office? It's the best one .for

naps.

GRADY

I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We

could probably stand him up in the garage with

the snow shovels at this point.

GRADY

Ail right. In my office.

HANNAH GREEN

Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

VERNON HARDAPPLE

You driving this car?

GRADY

Excuse me?

VERNON HARDAPPLE

This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving

this car?

GRADY

It's mine.

TRAXLER

Well, jeez, you're reading his biography,

I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

JAMES LEER

I put you on the floor.

GRADY

Oh.

JAMES LEER

I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow

your tongue or something.

(nodding to Grady's robe)

I guess you really miss her, huh?

GRADY

Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write

in it.

JAMES LEER

I guess there's probably a story behind that.

GRADY

There is, but it's not that interesting.

JAMES LEER

Want me to get that?

GRADY

Sure.

JAMES LEER

(returning)

He didn't give his name.

GRADY

Who?

JAMES LEER

The guy on the phone.

GRADY

What'd he say?

JAMES LEER

He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here

and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500

with black interior.

GRADY

What'd you tell him?

JAMES LEER

Yes.

GRADY

Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be

sure to mention the back door pops open with a

couple hard shakes to the right.

JAMES LEER

I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or

something. Is that single-spaced?

GRADY

Afraid so.

JAMES LEER

That's a big book you're writing.

GRADY

I think it's sort of writing itself at this

point.

JAMES LEER

Wow, Hannah always swore you were working,

but--

GRADY

But . . . ?

JAMES LEER

Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been

awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some

people--some of the kids in workshop--thought

maybe you were...

GRADY

Washed up?

JAMES LEER

Blocked.

GRADY

Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

JAMES LEER

No kidding.

CRABTREE

Good morning, boys. James.

GRADY

(re: James' "attire")

If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast,

I'd put on something a little less comfortable

if I were you.

JAMES LEER

Professor Tripp?

GRADY

Hm.

JAMES LEER

How did I get here last night?

GRADY

No one seems to know where you live, James.

Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

JAMES LEER

And ...and before that. Did I do anything?

Anything bad?

GRADY

Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the

English Department's dog and steal his most

prized piece of memorabilia.

GRADY

Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

Good morning...

47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)

Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of

place. Suspicious maybe...

48	EXT. FRONT PORCH

GRADY

Well, there's always people you don't know at

these things, but I can't say there was anybody

particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one

guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

OFFICER PUPCIK

A jockey? You mean, like--

GRADY

Horses, right. Vernon something...

(thinking... )

Hardpple

OFFICER PUPCIK

Hardapple?

GRADY

I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

OFFICER PUPCIK

Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's

closet. And the dog's missing.

GRADY

That's weird.

OFFICER PUPCIK

We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's

blind and we figure he just wandered off and

got run over.

GRADY

The perpetrator.

OFFICER PUPCIK

No, the dog.

GRADY

Just kidding.

OFFICER PUPCIK

One other thing. About this kid, this student

of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know

how I could get in touch with him, would you?

GRADY

I might have his number on campus.

OFFICER PUPCIK

That's all right. We'll find him.

HANNAH GREEN (O.S.)

There you are...

out. I was asked to leave.

GRADY

I guess there's probably a story behind that.

JAMES LEER

There is, but it's not that interesting.

GRADY

So where have you been staying?

JAMES LEER

(a long pause)

The bus station.

JAMES LEER

It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor.

And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

GRADY

(trying to fathom this)

But James. I mean. ..How long?

JAMES LEER

A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had

the gun. For protection.

GRADY

Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

JAMES LEER

Who?

Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this

morning. Can you talk?

SARA

Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for

WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole

Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing,

too.

GRADY

I-heard.

SARA

You heard? How?

GRADY

A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house

this morning.

SARA

Did you confess?

SARA

Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

GRADY

Really? That was fast.

SARA

(frowning)

I'm kidding. Hello?

GRADY

Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There

is something I need to tell...

SARA

Are you limping? Why are you limping?

GRADY

Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to .

. .

SARA

Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall

somewhere?

GRADY

No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I

don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell

you something.

SARA

All right.

GRADY

I...

GRADY (cont'd)

...want to be with you.

SARA

Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I

don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

GRADY

Really, Sara, I...

SARA

I believe you. I believe you want to be with

me. But this is not just about me anymore.

GRADY

I know that. I know what's at stake here...

SARA

No, I don't think you do. And besides... I

haven't decided yet.

GRADY

About the baby.

SARA

That ...and you.

SARA

I'm not going to draw the map for you on this

one, Grady. Times like these you have to do

your own navigating.

SARA

Who's that sitting in your car?

GRADY

James Leer.

SARA

What's he doing out there?

GRADY

I'm sort of helping him work through some

You' re not planning on puking in my car, are

you, James?

Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley

No.

JAMES LEER (cont'd)

I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

JAMES LEER (cont'd)

I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I

know what those houses are like. I know what

the people are like.

GRADY

It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

GRADY

Glaucoma?

JAMES LEER

Colon cancer.

It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a

small town.

GRADY

Where's that?

JAMES LEER

Carvel.

GRADY

Carvel? Where's Carvel?

JAMES LEER

Outside Scranton.

GRADY

I never heard of it.

JAMES LEER

It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin

factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five

years.

GRADY

Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

JAMES LEER

Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn.

She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before

that, she'd been a dancer.

GRADY

What kind of dancer? .

JAMES LEER

Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

GRADY

(in disbelief)

James Leer, are you telling me your mother was

a stripper?

JAMES LEER

I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle.

And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's

clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a

bad debt.

GRADY

Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic

school?

JAMES LEER

When we fall, we fall hard.

HANK

I was thinking of you.

And?

HANK

It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you

know that. It's a young man's book. It got me

remembering how it felt to be young.

GRADY

Maybe I should read it.

HANK

Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you

aging prematurely, Grady.

Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley

Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot

of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I

have the book to finish and--

HANK

Ah, right. The book.

GRADY

Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I

didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want

you to know that.

HANK

Why did you come here, Grady?

GRADY

I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily.

And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let

everyone know that, even though it may be

difficult to comprehend now, this-everything

that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't

Tripp.

GRADY

I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a

favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's

not for amateurs.

JAMES LEER

I just wanted a little sip.

GRADY

(squinting at him)

I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James,

exactly what point was it that you turned into

Serpent Boy?

JAMES LEER

Probably about the time you gave me the

codeine pills last night.

GRADY

Jesus...

(thinking, then. . . )

Look, James, you appear to possess-like many

an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a

rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which

dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best

if, for the moment at least

(taking the Ziploc)

...we abstain.

JAMES LEER

You're mad at me, aren't you?

GRADY

What?

JAMES LEER

You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's

dog.

GRADY

It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--

(stopping)

Who said anything about girlfriend?

GRADY

Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my

girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't

exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no

reason for him to take two in the chest. Still,

the fact remains that I'm the one who took you

up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one

who has to take the blame. I- don't know what

the hell I was thinking.

JAMES LEER

Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap

gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking

'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he

might never get on the bus again.' You were

thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract

this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a

noble act.

GRADY

Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never

done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

JAMES LEER

So, why did you take me up there?

GRADY

(feeling for the heat again)

I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do

half the things I do. Who does?

(looking over)

Why do you wear that coat?

JAMES LEER

It's warm.

GRADY

James, fall semester, first day of class, it

was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

GRADY

That's why they all give you such a hard time

in workshop.

JAMES LEER

Because of my coat?

GRADY

Because you act like a goddamn spook all the

time. Not to mention the fact that every last

one of them is jealous of you.

JAMES LEER

(smirking)

Jealous? Of me?

GRADY

Not you. Your talent.

JAMES LEER

You're lying.

GRADY

The hell I am.

JAMES LEER

Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You

said so yourself.

GRADY

I never said that.

JAMES LEER

Yes you did. Last night. To your friend

Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you

said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

GRADY

I didn't mean it that way.

JAMES LEER

It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard,

the others--they 're right. My stories are

annoying. They go on and on and on, and the

longer they go on the more annoying they

become, until finally you just want to grab

something heavy and--

GRADY

Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and

Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking

about, okay? The entire class combined-

including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one

tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

JAMES LEER

But, last night...

GRADY

Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I

was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a

dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me

some slack?

JAMES LEER

(quietly)

I'm sorry.

GRADY

And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares

what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a

good writer? You want to be-a great writer?

Then stop giving a damn what other people

think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

GRADY

Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books

don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not

anymore.

JAMES LEER

Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

JAMES LEER

I mean it. It means something to me. It's one

of the reasons I came to school here. To be in

your class. To be taught by you.

(quietly)

It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a

writer.

GRADY

Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm

sorry.

we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't

have spells.

JAMES LEER

What would you call them then?

GRADY

I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

JAMES LEER

It's because you don't eat.

GRADY

I eat.

JAMES LEER

When?

GRADY

When nobody's looking.

JAMES LEER

(mouth full, garbled)

I just worry about you, that's all.

GRADY

You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

FRED LEER

Hardly.

AMANDA LEER

We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck

would have it, the club was on the way, so...

(snapping shut the visor)

We were able to put in an appearance.

FRED LEER

Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

GRADY

Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a

little dinner.

FRED LEER

Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

GRADY

That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might

be good for James to be with his family this

weekend.

FRED LEER

Well, of course, we can understand that.

GRADY

Well. Let me go get him.

GRADY (cont'd)

I "hope you won't consider this forward of me,

Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you

ever attend Catholic school?

AMANDA LEER

Excuse me?

77	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77

JAMES LEER

I'm not going with them..

GRADY

James. Listen. Things-things are a little

weird with me right now and I-- well--I have

enough blame to shoulder these days without

having to take the blame if something bad

happened to you. And if you hang around me long

enough, something bad is going to happen, trust

me. That's why I need you to go home.

Understand?

JAMES LEER

I'm not going, with them.

GRADY

James, like it or not, they're your parents.

JAMES LEER

Parents? They're not my parents. They're my

grandparents. My parents are dead.

JAMES LEER

I swear. My father had his own airplane he

used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and

my mom were flying up to our house in the

Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in

the newspaper.

JAMES LEER

I 'swear. My father was a senior vice

president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite.

Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

GRADY

I remember that. Five or six years ago.

JAMES LEER

Six. Their plane went down right outside

Scranton.

GRADY

(sardonically)

Near Carvel?

JAMES LEER

I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like

to talk about my family. They treat me like a

freak.

(nodding towards Amanda)

GRADY

James, come on. That man is obviously your

father. You look just like him.

JAMES LEER

There's a reason for that.

GRADY

Get out of here.

JAMES LEER

That's why she hates me. That's why she makes

me sleep in the basement.

GRADY

In the crawl space, with the rats and the

casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

I swear.

GRADY

No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it

out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been

HANNAH GREEN

I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

GRADY

Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that

aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The

Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

HANNAH GREEN

At first the police thought he just ran away,

but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood

CRABTREE said it sounded like something James

would be messed up in.

Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

Who does?

GRADY

The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James

that day?

HANNAH GREEN

I told you, Sewickly Heights.

But where? I need the street.

HANNAH GREEN

I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a

No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for

Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-

GRADY

You stay there.

CRABTREE

What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

CRABTREE

Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would

sneak in here and read your book without asking

you?

GRADY

Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to

remember you actually asking me if you could

invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

CRABTREE

Sometimes we have to improvise.

GRADY

(ignoring him)

Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I

mean, besides you and. ..me?

CRABTREE

James? My James? What's happened?

GRADY

Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't

know.. .kidnapped.

CRABTREE

Kidnapped? By who?

GRADY

His parents.

CRABTREE

Good God. Let's go rescue him.

GRADY

Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't

know where they live.

CRABTREE

Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know

where he lives.

GRADY

It's a little late to call Admissions.

CRABTREE

chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling

methamphetamines.

CRABTREE

I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I

feel this kid in my bones.

GRADY

Only in your bones?

CRABTREE

No. I think I might be right. I've felt it

before...

GRADY

How bad is it for you?

CRABTREE

Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit

the new corporate profile.

GRADY

Which is?

CRABTREE

Competence.

CRABTREE (cont'd)

So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

go get dressed.

Ah, wear whatever you want.

Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

No, it's not that, it's...

HANNAH GREEN

It's just that, you know, I was thinking about

how, in class, you're always telling us '-that

writers make choices--at least the good ones.

And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the

book isn't really great-I mean, really great-

but at times it's, well, very detailed, you

know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses

and ail the dental records and so on-and I

don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of

reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...

(with trepidation)

GRADY

Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as

shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first

writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore,

it might interest you to know that one book I

wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, '

happened to win a little something called the

Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car.

I never forget an Oola.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)

Forget me?

GRADY

Vernon.

VERNON

(to Oola)

Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

GRADY

Who's got a gun?

VERNON

You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

GRADY

Relax, Vernon...

OOLA

Why's he calling you Vernon?

VERNON

Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's

why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

GRADY

Not true. You're the only Vernon I know.

Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon

Peabody at Penguin U.K.

VERNON

Shut up.

(to Oola)

Cupcake. Please. Inside.

OOLA

You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

VERNON

I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that

gun down.

GRADY

It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the

caps anymore.

VERNON

Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And

that's a gun.

GRADY

No, really....

You all right, cupcake?

Who's Vernon?

VERNON

What the...?

CRABTREE

Tripp! Run!

VERNON

Who the hell is that?

GRADY

A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon

girl's clutch.

VERNON

Woah.

VERNON (cont'd)

Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

GRADY

No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

GRADY

Oh... my... God!

(to Vernon)

I take it back.  Shoot him.

CRABTREE

Naturally you have copies.

GRADY

I have an alternate version of the first

chapter.

CRABTREE

You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle,

when he lost his luggage.

GRADY

That was MacCaulay.

CRABTREE

Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those

stories.

GRADY

He was never able to reproduce them.

CRABTREE

Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to

depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a

sense- this--

(nodding to the pages)

is for the best.

GRADY

Kind of a sign, you're saying.

CRABTREE

In a sense.

GRADY

I don't think so. In my experience, signs are

usually a lot more subtle.

VERNON

Let me get this straight. All that paper that

went into the river. That was the only copy?

GRADY

'Fraid so.

VERNON

(glowering at Crabtree)

And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What

the fuck's the matter with you?

CRABTREE

I'm just saying that sometimes,

subconsciously, a person will put themselves in

a situation-perhaps even create that situation-

in order to have an arena in which to work out

an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you

will, of addressing a problem.

VERNON

I'll tell you the problem. You behind the

wheel. There's your fucking problem.

CRABTREE

That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

VERNON

Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights

in the middle of the street none of this

happens.

CRABTREE

Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun

to his head?

VERNON

He was trying to steal my car!

GRADY

Ail right, all right It's done. There's no

need to talk about it. It's done.

OOLA

So what was it about?

(as GRADY looks up)

Your book.  What was the story?

GRADY

I don't know...

CRABTREE

What he means is, it's difficult to distill

the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in

the mind.

VERNON

Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about,

right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was

about, why were you writing it?

GRADY

I couldn't stop.

110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

GRADY

Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

VERNON

Shoot.

GRADY

Boy or girl?

VERNON

As long as it looks like her, I don't care.

You know what I'm saying?

GRADY

Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

VERNON

No sweat. Only do me a favor?

GRADY

Sure.

VERNON

Stop calling me Vernon.

CRABTREE

The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

GRADY (cont'd)

Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

OOLA

Yea?

GRADY

It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had

small shoulders, like you. Most people don't

know that.

VERNON

Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty

motherfucking ride.

CRABTREE

You mind explaining what you just did?

GRADY

Came to my senses. CRABTREE

Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is

James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell

to come to his?

GRADY

Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer

to jail, Crabs. I know that.

CRABTREE

Do you know he won't expel him?

GRADY

No. But I don't think that matters.

CRABTREE

That's very enlightened, Professor. It's

comforting to know that America's children have

you for a teacher.

GRADY

Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell

them what you know. You tell them to find their

voice and stick with it, because that's all you

have in the end. You tell the ones who have it

to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't

to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way

to get where you're going.

(ruefully)

Of course, it helps if you know where you want

to go.

(thoughtfully)

Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--

that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

GRADY (cont'd)

As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

GRADY (cont'd)

He's got you.

CRABTREE

Me? What can I do?

GRADY

Gee, I don't know, Crabs...

(over his shoulder)

Improvise. You're good at that.

CRABTREE

I'm sorry, Tripp.

GRADY

You peeked, didn't you?

CRABTREE

I peeked.

CRABTREE

It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a

lot to admire. I've ...never read anything

quite like it.

GRADY

You're not just trying to make me feel better?

CRABTREE

Scout's honor.

GRADY

Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look

Hey, Professor Tripp.

CARRIE MCWHIRTY

If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the

No...

Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to

be in workshop?

Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango

WALTER

And now, as those of you who've been with us

in previous years know, we have a tradition of

sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of

course, of The Plums.

WALTER

This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock,

found a publisher for her children's book. The

Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

WALTER

And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for

his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has

found a home with Putnam for his new Three

Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

WALTER

Now, this next one, I think, is especially

exciting to announce, because it concerns a

student here at the university. Our own James

Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has

found a publisher for his first novel, which I

believe is called The Lovely Parade.

CARRIE MCWHIRTY

I have a class with him.

CARRIE MCWHIRTY

The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know

what I mean.

GRADY

Take a bow, James!

GRADY (cont'd)

(softly)

Wonder Boy.

WALTER

And finally--and perhaps not least

importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has

also decided to publish my own book--a critical

exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and

Joe DiMaggio and its function in American

mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled

The Last American Marriage.     "

WALTER

Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

GRADY

Looking for you.

121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

GRADY

I passed out.

GREENHUT

You did.

GRADY

I've been doing that a lot lately.

GREENHUT

So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of

marijuana, I understand.

GRADY

Do you think that's why I've been having

these...

(grabbing James' term)

... spells?

GREENHUT

How long have you been having them?

GRADY

The last month maybe.

GREENHUT

How long have you been smoking marijuana?

GRADY

Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

GREENHUT

That's probably not the problem, then. What

about your lifestyle. Any major changes

recently?

GRADY

I've been trying to finish a book...

GREENHUT

And your wife left you.

GRADY

Is that in my chart?

GREENHUT

I spoke with the woman who saved your life.

You're lucky she came along when she did.

GRADY

I know.

GREENHUT

(tapping the glucose bottle)

You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An

internist. And I think you really ought to

consider seeing a therapist, as well.

GRADY

She told you about. . .

GREENHUT

Her dog, yes.

GRADY

Actually, it was her husband's dog...

GREENHUT

Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all

right? On top of that, you have a bite on your

ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you

with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another

day or two and you might have lost the foot. As

for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result

of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

GRADY

They're anxiety attacks? That's a little

disappointing.

GREENHUT

Better luck next time.

GRADY

So is my friend...is Sara still here?

GREENHUT

No. There's no one here.

GRADY

I have to see her. As soon as possible.

GREENHUT

Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave,

I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a

prescription for a course of ampicillin and I

want you to follow it to the end-no matter how

stupid you decide to be with everything else.

All right?

out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

GRADY

I'm through improvising.

SARA

Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true?

Did you lose it all?

GRADY

I lost it ail.

SARA

Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

GRADY

I know.

SARA

And you're old.

GRADY

Ouch. How many?

SARA

Dozens. It's very sad.

GRADY

I went and looked at-some babies just now.

SARA

Oh?

GRADY

(trying to make her laugh)

I guess you have to go on faith.

SARA

(she doesn't)

Some times...

GRADY

Did you tell Walter?

SARA

I told Walter.

GRADY

Does he still love you?

SARA

It didn't come up.

GRADY

Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I

didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been

waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're

who I need. Because nothing makes sense without

you. Because the best moment of every day is

the moment I first see your face. And because

when you leave a room, there's no reason to be

in it any more. It's just a room again.

SARA

Did you just make that up?

GRADY

(shaking his head)

In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about

it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy

painkillers.

GRADY (cont'd)

Even so...it's still true. Every word.

GRADY (cont'd)

Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might

tell you...

SARA

Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

GRADY

You don't deserve me, you know.

SARA

I know, but sometimes...

SARA (cont'd)

You just go on faith.
