GARDNER

(next to Chris, Southern accent)

That what I think it is?

SOLDIER 1

(a look)

I guess so ...

SERGENT

Okay, let's go ...

VETERANS

Well I'll be dipped in shit - new meat!  Sorry bout

that boys - 'sin loi' buddy ... you gonna love the

Nam, man, for-fucking-ever.

BARNES

What are you waiting for?  He ain't gonna bite you.

Move out.

HARRIS

Bravo Two, Six.  What's the delay up there, move it

out on point.  We've got a link up at Phase Line

Whiskey at One Eight Zero Zero, over.

LIEUTENANT WOLFE

Two Bravo, Two move it out.  Six says we're jamming

'em up back there.  Over.

BARNES

Tell that dipshit to get fucked.  Get that other

freshmeat up here.  Gardner.

BARNES (CONT'D)

What the hell's the matter with you Taylor!  You a

sorry ass motherfucker.  Fall back.

DOC

You okay?

CHRIS

Ants.  I got ants on my neck ...

(shaking them out)

DOC

(helping him)

Yeah, black ants are killers, you look sick man.  You

need a little salt.

(reaching into his satchel)

ELIAS

(shaking his head, amused)

You're humping way too much, troop, don't need half

this shit.  I'll haul it for you but next time you

check it out with me okay?

KING

You're a sick mother Bunny.

ELIAS

(concerned)

Hold it up.

CHRIS

(trying to get up)

I'm okay ... I'm okay.

FRANCIS

Shit, King, it ain't d-e-r-e man, it's d-e-a-r, and

Sara don't have no two r's in it, fool.  Shame on

you.

KING

Don't matter, she knows what it means ... an she

don't read too good nohow ...

LERNER

Mumm, any time sweetheart.

ELIAS

Lerner, you'd choke to death on it.

CAPTAIN HARRIS

Sky Six reports a fresh company of NVA moving across

from Cambodia to this blue line.

(points to position)

We got a good chance to light 'em up tonight.  All

platoons will set squad-size ambushes before full

dark.  Lt. Wolfe

(glances at him)

You 'bush in this area near that ol' Buddhist temple

we passed on the hump in.  Lt. Hawkins, you take this

area in the rubber plantation...

LIEUTENANT WOLFE

(eager)

No problem sir ...

JUNIOR

(a whining high voice)

Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake

man.

BIG HAROLD

(laughes loudly)

Fuck you bitch.

JUNIOR

C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you

the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.

BIG HAROLD

Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is

nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start

your game playing with me Junior.

JUNIOR

Youse a pig man.  I hope Manny get dat laundry gig

for' you do.

BIG HAROLD

De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known

for his thinking.

JUNIOR

He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool.  Hey,

whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna

dig itself ...

JUNIOR (CONT'D)

Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass

today.  I killed a shit-eating dog.

(laughing)

BIG HAROLD

(getting up)

That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.

JUNIOR

You gonna wipe your ass dis time?

BIG HAROLD

Yeah if you let me have your shirt.

CHRIS

(VOICE OVER, as he digs)

Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of

Reason.  That's what this place feels like.  I hate

it already and it's only been a week.  Some goddamn

week, grandma ...

(checking his raw blisters)

... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go

on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what

I'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front

of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get

up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m.,

dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or

a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary

cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm

new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't

even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a

new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't

put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna

get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the

first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer

that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky

you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then

you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4

hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't

think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I

think I've made a big mistake coming here ...

BARNES

(to all, almost pleased about it)

We got boo-coo movement.  3rd Battalion just got hit

15 kliks north of here.

(the MEN react with wary silence)

O'NEILL

(eager to elaborate)

Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew

a whole fucking platoon to pieces.  BAAD SHIT.

BARNES

Yeah, they got two Lieutenants and a Captain.

WOLFE

Jesus.

WOLFE (CONT'D)

(to Barnes)

Who do you want on ambush, Sergeant?

BARNES

Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and

Francis from your squad.

(to Warren)

We move out in two-zero mikes.

(concluding)

ELIAS

I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

O'NEILL

Shit!  Morehouse and Sal are short.  Fu Sheng's going

on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an

ambush.  You got the fresh meat Elias.

ELIAS

(to Barnes)

They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna

run into something.

O'NEILL

So what am I going to do!  Get one of my guys zapped

so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his

beauty fucking sleep!

ELIAS

Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to

be a prick everyday of your life, you know.

O'NEILL

Fuck you Elias.

BARNES

You get your men ready Elias ...

O'NEILL

(watching him)

Fucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's

Cochise or something ...

CUT TO:

TEX

Shit, looks like rain.  All night too.  Gonna grow

mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior.

JUNIOR

(under his breath)

Goddamn ain't no justice round here, you break your

ass for de white man ... gonna get our act together,

do some rappin' wid de brothers, change things ...

CRAWFORD

What's O'Neill have a nose up the lieutenant's ass

already, how come we always get ambush.

FRANCIS

Politics, man, politics.  We always getting fucked

around here.

GARDNER

Hey Chris, I show you a picture of Lucy Jean?

CHRIS

(not to be bothered)

No ...

GARDNER

(admiring)

Yeah she's the one all right ... that's Lucy Jean.

She's a-waiting for me.

CHRIS

(nodding)

Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ...

ELIAS

(to both boys)

Don't need this or this ... you're doing okay.  Just

stick close to Tex, do what he does.

(calling out to Tex)

Tex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

TEX

Damn, 'Lias this gun's boss.  Put Taylor someplace

else.

ELIAS

You got Taylor ...

(to Gardner)

... Gardner you go with me

(to Chris and Gardner)

'Case somethin' happens to you, you get separated or

lost don't yell out okay.  Sit tight.  We'll get to

you.

BARNES

Okay, let's move out.

TEX

Taylor, you're on.

CHRIS

(groggy)

Uh hunh.

TEX

(suspicious)

You sure you know how to work the claymore?

CHRIS

(offended)

Sure.

TEX

Okay ... don't catch no zzz's on me buddy or I'll

sling your motherfucking ass ... You hear me?

CHRIS

(grits his teeth)

Yeah.

(looking at his watch)

Hey Tex - you're ten minutes fast.

TEX

Sin Loi.

('tough luck', closes his teeth)

CHRIS

Junior!

JUNIOR

Unh? ... Unh.

CHRIS

Shaddup!  You're snoring ... Shhh.

CUT TO:

CHRIS (V.O.)

(continuing his letter)

... 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they

wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard-

working, making $200 a week, a little house, a

family.  They drove me crazy with their goddamn

world, grandma, you know Mom, I don't want to be a

white boy on Wall Street, I don't want my whole life

to be predetermined by them.

CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... I guess I have always been sheltered and special,

I just want to be anonymous.  Like everybody else.

Do my share for my country.  Live up to what Grandpa

did in the First War and Dad the Second.  I know this

is going to be the war of my generation.  Well here I

am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really

cares about - they come from the end of the line,

most of 'em, small towns you never heard of -

Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend,

Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania.  Two years' high school's

about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for

'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing,

they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society,

yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom

and what we call America, they're the bottom of the

barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call

themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can

take anything.  They're the backbone of this country,

grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul

- I've found it finally, way down here in the mud -

maybe from down here I can start up again and be

something I can be proud of, without having to fake

it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see,

learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I

miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Wake up!

CHRIS (CONT'D)

It's your shift, man ...

TEX

THE CLAYMORE!  GET THOSE FUCKERS!

TEX (CONT'D)

THE SAFETY! TAKE THE SAFETY OFF YOU ...

TEX

TEX (CONT'D)

AAAAAGHHH! MY ARM! MY ARM!

JUNIOR

Oh shit, Doc he's hit too.

CHRIS

(weakly)

JUNIOR

(to Barnes, pointing at Chris)

That dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

DOC

(to Chris)

CHRIS

(suspicious)

Doc ... tell me the truth, don't lie to me.

JUNIOR

(to Barnes)

He let'em walk right up on us.  He was sleeping on

his shift.

CHRIS

(muttering weakly)

I was not ... it was your ...

DOC

(leaving, to Harold and Junior)

Self-preservation's the first law of nature.  Gotta

learn how to work your shit Taylor.  Watch me, don't

let'em go into shock.

BARNES

Shut up!  Shut up - and TAKE IT!  TAKE THE PAIN!

BIG HAROLD

You gonna be okay Taylor, okay, don't you start

CHRIS

Do you ... do you know you're gonna die ... Big

BIG HAROLD

Bullshit man, you gettin outta the field, man.  Three

BIG HAROLD

CHRIS

BUNNY

cocksucker's six and a half feet tall.  Look at his

gear - good as ours.

FRANCIS

I seen him walking around afterwards.

MANNY

ELIAS

Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.

BARNES

How the hell did he get away?

ELIAS

Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up.  Hard

core fuckin' NVA.  They got their shit together.

RING

(coming up to Barnes)

Sarge - Doc wants you.  There's a problem with the

new man.

DOC

Chopper's on the way Gardner, hang in there, you

BARNES

Take a good look at this lump o'shit ...

(motions to Gardner's body)

Rmember what it looks like, all of you.  You fuck up

in a firefight and I guaran-goddamn-tee you, a trip

out of the bush - IN A BODYBAG.  Out here, assholes,

(glares directly at Chris)

and that goes for you, shit for brains.  You don't

SLEEP ON NO FUCKIN' AMBUSH.  Next sonofabitch I catch

coppin' z's in the bush I'm personally gonna take an

interest in seeing him suffer - I SHIT YOU NOT ...

CHRIS

(drowsy)

I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant, Junior ...

BUNNY

(pissed, cuts in, shoves him hard)

Shut your face chicken shit!  You in big trouble boy!

O'NEILL

Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got

one.

ELIAS

Knock it off!  We got two men need attention here.

Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave

nothing for the dinks.  Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.

JUNIOR

(muttering)

Let de white boy carry his ass, he this dude that got

him fucked up.  Who'd be hauling his ass if that was

a brother laying there?

ELIAS

Man'd be alive if he'd had a few more days to learn

something.

KING

CHRIS

Okay - got light duty, three days.

KING

Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.

ELIAS

LERNER

(skeptical)

You can plant that shit in Tennessee man, but it

CRAWFORD

ELIAS

bathing suit looks like a hutch ...

BIG HAROLD

You know find out if she is what she is.

KING

ELIAS

Well she was picking up her kids.

BIG HAROLD

leather sandals you know, with those thongs up to her

knees, this musky oil on it ... mmmm smelled good

DOC

CHRIS

another girl seeming like I'm having fun although she

may be cute she's just a substitute because you're

the permanent one ...'

ALL (CONT'D)

'... So take a good look at my face.  You'll see the

smile looks out of place.  Look a little bit closer.

It's easy to trace.  The tracks of my tears...'

CHRIS (V.O.)

New Year's Day, 1968.  Just another day.  Staying

alive.  There's been a lot of movement neat the

Cambodian border, regiments of NVA moving across.  A

lot of little firefights, ambushes, we drop a lot of

bombs, then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in

a landscape ...

BARNES

Pssst!

BARNES (CONT'D)

(whispers)

Bunker ...

CHRIS

CUT TO:

SANDERSON

SANDERSON

Goddamit!  Are you fucking kids ever gonna learn!

Don't you understand how easy it is to die!

DOC

ELIAS

WOLFE

(consulting his map)

There's a gook village half a klik downriver,

Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP,

BARNES

WARREN

FRANCIS

Hey man whatcha doing ... where you at?  Get your

FRANCIS AND OTHERS

(whispering loudly)

Manny? ... Manny?

CHRIS (V.O.)

We had to get to the village before dark so we left

Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for

the engineers ... But it was King who found him ...

about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village

- It was the end of the mystery.

CHRIS (V.O.)

... the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand

years, didn't know we were coming that day.  If they

had they would have run ... Barnes was at the eye of

our rage - and through him, our Captain Ahab - we

would set things right again.  That day we loved him

...

BUNNY

Hey pig, pig - come here, pig, pig.

TONY

There goes one!

BARNES

(to Tony)

Check him out.

SGTS.O'NEIL AND WARREN

Get em out!  Get em out!

BARNES

BARNES (CONT'D)

(to Harold)

Put'em in the pig pen.

BARNES (CONT'D)

FIRE IN THE HOLE!

FU SHENG

(hustling up to Barnes)

Sarge, we found some shit!

CHRIS

La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!

FRANCIS

Hey take it easy man.  They're scared.

CHRIS

They're scared?  What about me!  I'm sick of this

shit man, I"m sick of this shit!  They don't want us

here!  Who do you think they're fighting for!  GET

OUTTA THERE!

SGT. WARREN

(to Barnes)

... and over here there's enough rice to feed a whole

fuckin' regiment ...

BARNES

(to Warren)

... bring the honcho over here.

(to Tubb and Junior)

Burn it.

BUNNY

Hey look at this! Ma and Pa Kettle here.  Look at

CHRIS

Get up out of there! ... You see I didn't wanna hurt

you.  Why didn't you come out, when I said so hunh!

Why? WHY! WHY? DON'T YOU LISTEN ... WHAT ARE YOU

BUNNY

CHRIS

(demonic)

FRANCIS

(leaves)

Let's get out of here man.

BUNNY

(to Chris)

You chickenshit man, they're laughing at you, look at

them faces.  That's the way a gook laughs.

BUNNY (CONT'D)

Yeah sure you are, you're real sorry ain't you.

You're just crying out your hearts about Sandy and

Sal and Manny - they're laughing at us!  Their family

is out there in the fucking bush blowing us away and

they're laughing at us!

O'NEILL

(checking out the hutch)

Forget it will ya, let's go ...

O'NEILL (CONT'D)

(stunned)

Hey what are you doing!

BUNNY

Fucker!

BUNNY (CONT'D)

That's for Sandy!  And this is for Sal!  And this is

for fucking Manny!  This is for me!

BUNNY (CONT'D)

(stepping back, examines what's left of the head, amazed)

Wow!  You see his fucking head come apart?  Look at

that ... I never seen brains like dat before.  Jesus

fucking Christ ...

BUNNY (CONT'D)

Betcha the old bitch runs the whole show.  Probably

helped cut Manny's throat.  Probably cut my balls off

if she could.

(to Chris)

Come on, man, let's do her.

BUNNY (CONT'D)

(hitting her again)

Let's zap all these motherfuckers!  Let's do the

whole village!

BUNNY (CONT'D)

GET BACK HERE YOU FUCKING COWARD O'NEILL.  THIS IS

FOR SANDY ... THIS IS FOR SANDY MAN! AND SAL! AND

MANNY!

BARNES

Where'd he get these wounds?

LERNER

He says he was hit in a bombing raid.

TONY

He's a dink fosure.

BARNES

Ask him what the weapons are doing here?

LERNER

He says they had no choice.  The NVA killed the old

honcho when he said no.  He says the rice is theirs.

BARNES

Bullshit ... who the hell was the dink we just nailed

on the riverbank?

LERNER

... He says he doesn't know, NVA haven't been around

in a couple of months.  Maybe it was a scout or ...

BARNES

Yeah sure it was.  What about all that fucking rice

and the weapons ... who they for?

(looking at the Village Chief)

Cocksucker knows what I'm saying ... don't you Pop?

(a blank look)

ACE

You're goddamn right he does!

LERNER

(finally)

He swears he doesn't know anything!  He hates the NVA

but they come when they want and ...

JUNIOR

He's lying through his teeth!

TONY

Waste the fucker, then see who talks.

BARNES

What's the bitch saying?

LERNER

(overwhelmed)

She's going on, I don't know - why are we shooting

the pigs, they're farmers ... they got to make a

living, all that crap ...

BARNES

(to Lerner)

Tell him he talks or I'm gonna waste more of 'em.

BARNES (CONT'D)

Go ahead, Lerner, ask him.

LERNER

They don't know Sarge, they don't know!

(half believes it)

ACE

(sensing the impending massacre)

Hey Sarge can we get in on this.

TONY

Let's go all the way, let's go for it!  Let's do the

whole fucking village.  Come on, Sarge.

BARNES

This his daughter, right?

BARNES (CONT'D)

(to Village Chief)

You lie ... You Vee Cee ... I caca ado Vee Cee!

ELIAS

ELIAS (CONT'D)

BARNES

BARNES

ELIAS

WOLFE (CONT'D)

Alright, Six says torch this place!  Blow the weapons

in place.  Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake

ELIAS

(to Wolfe)

Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!

WOLFE

What are you talking about!

(turns away, goes about his business)

ELIAS

(spins him around)

You know what I'm talking about!

WOLFE

No I don't.  I don't know what the fuck you're

talking about, Elias!

(goes)

KING

Whew! - where that come from?

RHAH

Found it.  Growing in a garden.

KING

(smokes)

Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway ...

RHAH

Yeah - stoned's the way to be ...

TONY

Take her up the ass ...

CHRIS

LET HER GO!  YOU HEAR ME!  YOU ASSHOLE!  LET HER GO!

TONY

What the fuck you want - she's a dink.

CHRIS

NO - YOU STUPID FUCK ... DON'T ... DON'T ... YOU TOO

BUNNY.  MOREHOUSE.  OFF!  NO!  DON'T ... DON'T!

CHRIS (CONT'D)

(to the girl)

It's okay ... it's okay ...

ELIAS

Get outta here.

CHRIS

(as if to himself)

It's okay, it's okay ...

CAPTAIN HARRIS

... and you Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT WOLFE

I didn't see anything sir.

ELIAS

I did.

LIEUTENANT WOLFE

That dink was reported to me as NVA sir by Sergeant

Barnes.  Sergeant Barnes.

ELIAS

My report sir, will include Lt.Wolfe as being witness

to the shooting ...

CAPTAIN HARRIS

All right, Elias.  Sergeant Barnes, I want a report

from you ...

BARNES

You got it sir - and I can throw in plenty of eye-

witnesses if you want sir ...

HARRIS

Not now.  We'll get into this when we get back to

base camp.  Right now I need every man in the field,

I want your guys to stick together ... Elias?

Barnes? ... You hear me?  This is no time for

fighting with each other.

(pause, they nod)

Tomorrow we're going back into that bunker complex -

from the East.

(continuing)

First Platoon will lead ... Brigade thinks they might

be back there tomorrow.  That's all ... Get some

rest.

(turns away)

WOLFE

Don't worry about it Sergeant, he won't be able to

prove a thing, he's a troublemaker but ...

BARNES

Elias' a waterwalker ... like them politicians in

Washington.  Want to fight their war with one hand

tied round their balls.  Ain't no time or need for a

courtroom out here ...

O'NEILL

How'd it go.

BUNNY

Thataway Sarge, fuckin' Elias man, fuckin' squeal

that's what he is, gonna get everybody in the platoon

in shit.  Somebody oughta fix his ass ...

O'NEILL

(worried)

Gonna be an investigation or something Bob?

BUNNY

Ya worry too much O'Neill ...

RHAH

I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something -

that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a

dog.

KING

Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking ...

CHRIS

Where's he form?

RHAH

Barnes comes from Hell.

LERNER

Tennessee someplace.  Hill country.

RHAH

Barnes took a bullet right there.  At Ia Drang Valley

(points to his forehead)

And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man.

That's his high, baby.  High on WAR!

KING

He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he

gets out, the first thing he done is re-up.  Four

years he been in the field ...

RHAH

... and you know how many times he done been shot?

(Chris shakes his head)

Seven times!

(with his fingers)

Seven.

CHRIS

And he still wanted to come back?

LERNER

Does a pee wee wanna take a wee wee?

RHAH

The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.

KING

Yeah, you done said it.  Revenge on US.

CHRIS

Does he have a metal plate in his head?

RHAH

(smiles)

You mean he's crazy?  No more crazy'n the rest of us

been out in the bush too long.

LERNER

Well he ain't normal that's fosure.

RHAH

That's what he is ... Baaaa!

RHAH (CONT'D)

... and he's FILLED with it.  He's roaming these

jungles looking for little yellow devils to kill.

Remember the Devil does God's work too.

(pause)

... and this here's Elias ... Baaaa!

KING

Love, yeah!

LERNER

(makes a cuckoo sign)

Here we go again with the crazy preacher stuff.  Rhah

seen too many movies.

RHAH

Baaa, got no time to go to the movies.  Love and Hate

too busy fighting for possession of my soul.

CHRIS

Where's Elias come from?

RHAH

(interjecting)

'Lias come naturally.

LERNER

... don't know.  Done some time.  Heard he worked the

oil wells in Oklahoma, made some bread and washed up

in El Lay.

KING

Yeah, get married to some crazy El Lay bitch, an

actress or somethin', she blew all his bread - LSD,

gurus, all that California shit, and then she turns

him into the cops on a drug rap.

RHAH

Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.

KING

So he got a reduced and come over here.  Nam's his

freedom man, Nam's his pussy.  Three years he been

here.

CHRIS

Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes ...

KING

Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back.  How you

gonna talk to civilians man?  People back in the

world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to

them you're a fuckin' animal is all -

LERNER

(to Chris)

I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just

worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for

themselves, they don't even want to talk about it

man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there -

you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here.  My

sister says to me why you have to go there like I

started this ...

RHAH

Baaaa!  Fuck it, they sold us out - so what!  What'd

you'all expect?  Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT

man.  They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television

and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody

dies.  That's all right, you keep fuckin' up,

politicians keep lyin'.  Cause it don't really

matter.  Don't mean shit.  So what!  Whatcha want - a

parade!  Fuck that too!  No war time no grunt never

got no respect.  Till he was dead - and even THEN!

You're fighting for YOURSELF man!  You're fighting

for your SOUL, dat's all.  Remember dat.  And it's

some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle

with that angel ...

(swings his entrenching tool in a rhythmic chain-gang style)

... Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's

the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna

change ...

CHRIS

... I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.

ELIAS

... don't feel like it either.

CHRIS

... beautiful night.

ELIAS

Yeah.  I love this place at night.  The stars ...

there's no right or wrong in them, they're just

there.

CHRIS

That's a nice way of putting it.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Barnes got it in for you, don't he?

ELIAS

(philosophically)

Barnes believes in what he's doing.

CHRIS

And you, do you believe?

ELIAS

In '65 - yeah.  Now ...

(pause)

No.  What happened today's just the beginning.  We're

gonna lose this war ...

CHRIS

(surprised)

You really think so ... us?

ELIAS

... we been kicking other people's asses so long I

guess it's time we got our own kicked.  The only

decent thing I can see coming out of here are the

survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you

Taylor going back to every little town in the country

knowing something about what it's like to take a life

and what that can do to a person's soul - twist it

like Barnes and Bunny and make 'em sick inside and if

you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of

your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the

cheapest thing I know and when some drunk like

O'Neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all

over him and when the politicians start selling you a

used war all over again, you and your generation

gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've

seen it, and when you know it, deep down there ...

ELIAS (CONT'D)

... you know it till you die ... that's why the

survivors remember.  'Cause the dead don't let em

forget.

ELIAS (CONT'D)

Oh shit!  Sometimes there's things in my head ...

man.  Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a

crazy Indian ...

CHRIS

Do you believe that stuff about ... knowing you're

gonna die?

ELIAS

Yeah, those are the guys that live.  I really don't

think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage

can, I think it takes whatever it can get ... you

never know where it's gonna come from anyway ... so

why spin your wheels?

CHRIS

... You ever think about reincarnation, all that

stuff?

ELIAS

Sure, goes on all the time.  Maybe a piece of me's in

you now, who knows.  But when you die - really die -

that's a big return ticket.

(soft)

I like to think I'm gonna come back as ... as wind or

fire - or a deer

(likes the image)

... yeah, a deer ...

HAROLD

Shit, lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma

glory hole.

FRANCIS

Hey Big Harold, put dat in your turkey loaf it won't

come out your back end.

KING

(ribbing)

Yeah, big boy, thought you had that laundry gig all

laid out?

BIG HAROLD

(pissed)

Shit, got to paint myself white get one of dem jobs.

Get ma request in for a circumcision.

KING

Gonna be a rabbi man?

FRANCIS

Gonna cut your pecker down to size hunh Big Harold?

BIG HAROLD

Dat's okay wid me, better to have a small one den no

one at all.

KING

Your girlfriends gonna look for new lovers, man.

Best thing a bro's got's his flap.

HAROLD

I'll drink to your flap in Chicago, King.  All I

gotta do is stretch it out to 15 days and I'll be

short 15 and the Beast just wouldn't dare send me

back to the bush.

FRANCIS

You gonna get some for me back in the World, Harold?

Whatcha gonna do?

(dreaming of it)

HAROLD

The world's gonna be ma oyster man.  First's I gonna

EAT - all the hamburger and french fries and steaks

soaked in onions and ketchup I can get.  Then I'se

gonna FUCK and SUCK Sandy Bell till I sore all over

and can't fuck no more, and den I'se gonna SLEEP for

DAYS, for WEEKS!  Den I'se gonna think bout what

comes next ...

RHAH

... you got one right there.

LIEUTENANT WOLFE

(in the stream, on radio)

All right move out.

FU SHENG

JUNIOR

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Direction six-one-zero-zero.  Dinks dug in bunkers.

RADIO VOICE

ACE

WOLFE

Fuckin' A!

ELIAS

Lootenant, they're kickin our ass, they know we're

gonna bring heavy shit on 'em pretty soon so they're

gonna get in tight under the arty.  I spotted a cut

WOLFE

(to Ace)

Where the fuck is red platoon!  Tell 'em to get their

asses up here!  What the fuck you doin' back here

Elias?  Round up your assholes and move 'em up front,

we're getting chopped to shit.

ELIAS

(yelling back)

Barnes, listen to me ... there's 5-6 spiderholes back

there

(points)

next to the church.

(draws it into the ground as he talks)

Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us.

Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these

holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in

a crossfire with 'em.  We'll shoot each other to

shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got.

It'll be a massacre!

WOLFE

Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.

ELIAS

Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First

Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!

(back to Barnes)

Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up

that flank.

BARNES

(a look)

Take off, but keep your radio here.

ELIAS

... You keep pouring out that suppressing fire,

Barnes.  I don't wanna be caught out there with my

ass hanging out you hear me?

BARNES

Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias,

you go crying to fucking brigade on your time.  Out

here you belong to me.  Now move.

ACE

BARNES

CHRIS

RHAH

(stringing them out)

Okay Crawford - over here.  Taylor - down twenty

yards behind that tree.

BARNES

(to Ace on radio, ignoring Wolfe)

Push Two Alpha and Two Charlie.  Tell'em to haul ass

and re-group at the church.  Tell'em NOT to fire.

(Ace transmits)

WOLFE

(with a threatening undertone)

BARNES (CONT'D)

There's the way it oughta be and there's the way it

is.  'Lias he was full of shit, 'Lias was a crusader

- I got no fight with a man does what he's told but

when he don't, the machine breaks down, and when the

machine breaks down, WE break down ... and I ain't

gonna allow that.  From none of you.  Not one ...

BARNES (CONT'D)

Y'all loved Elias, want to kick ass, I'se here - all

by my lonesome, nobody gonna know.  Five you boys

'gainst me?

(pause, very soft)

Kill me.

BARNES (CONT'D)

cocksucker!!!

RHAH

EASY BARNES, EASY MAN!!!

RHAH (CONT'D)

You'll do dinky dau in Long Binh Barnes.  Ten years -

kill an enlisted.  Ten years, Barnes, just climb the

walls.  DON'T DO IT ...

BARNES

(contemptuous)

Death?  What do you guys know about it?

CHRIS (V.O.)

They sent us back into the valley the next day -

about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion

perimeter.  Alpha Company had been hit hard the day

before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had

been probed that night.  There were other battalions

in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew

we were going to be the bait to lure them out.  And

somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA

Regiment.

ACE

... they caught 'em last night pulling some shit on

Charlie Company.  They found maps on 'em, man - got a

friend at Battalion says they had every fuckin'

foxhole here fixed on it.  Distances, treelines, our

claymores, trip wires, everything?  I shit you not.

DOC

Shit, so what the fuck are we doing here?  Why don't

we move ...

(no answer)

Bad vibes, man, I got bad vibes here.  Where are the

new guys they provided us anyway.

TONY

I heard we's in Cambodia right fuckin' NOW.

FRANCIS

You kidding man ...

RHAH

You wanted to see me sir?

WOLFE

Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.

RHAH

Squad?  I didn't know we was still referring to this

platoon in terms of squads sir.

(with a snicker for Ace and Doc)

WOLFE

(indicating a rough drawing in the dirt)

These two holes are yours ...

RHAH

Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far

enuff apart you could run a regiment through there

and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left

WOLFE

I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson.  You'll

get new men any day.  Time being you make do like

everybody else.

RHAH

Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I ...

WOLFE

(leaves)

I don't want to hear about it Jackson.

RHAH

(amazed, looking off at him)

You don't want to hear about it?

WOLFE

(turns)

That's right.  I don't want to hear about it 'cause

to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay ... I

just don't give a shit anymore.

RHAH

(shrugs, to himself)

Right ...

WOLFE

(passing Ace digging the CP hole)

This is one time we could sure use Elias.

ACE

(to Doc)

'Some people say I'm wishy washy.  Maybe I am.  Maybe

I ain't.'

KING

Glad I ain't going with 'em.  Somewhere out dere man

is de Beast and he hungry tonight ... Man, what a

bummer.  Ten days and a wakeup and I'm still dealing

wid this shit - fuckin' etcetera and ad infinitum man

...

KING (CONT'D)

(noticiing Chris' silence)

What's the matter wid you? ... How come you ain't

writing no more?  You was always writing something

home.  Looks like youse half a bubble off, Taylor.

KING (CONT'D)

What about your folks?  That grandma you was telling

me about? ...

KING (CONT'D)

Girl?

KING (CONT'D)

Must be somebody?

CHRIS

KING

(shifts, uncomfortable)

You been smoking too much shit babe.  Gotta control

that.  Takes a man down ... I remember when you first

come out to the bush, you was straight as a ...

CHRIS

Who gives a shit!

KING

(soft)

'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a

joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy

deep inside I'm blue ...'

CHRIS

Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just

can't get out of it?

KING

Way out of anything, man.  Just keep your pecker up,

your powder dry, the worm WILL turn.  How many days

you short?

CHRIS

Not just me ... it's the way the whole thing works.

People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes

just go on making up rules any way they want and what

do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck

on it!  We just don't add up to dry shit.

KING

Does a chicken have lips?  Whoever said we did, babe.

Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the

rest of your life man - gravy.  Oh shit, superlifer!

O'NEILL

Get your gear together, King, your orders just come

through.

KING

(speechless)

You jokin' me man? ... shit, you ain't kidding!

Cocksucker.  Oh wowww ... the lifers made a mistake,

O'NEILL

CHRIS

KING

TONY

Rumor goin' round is they got tanks.  Soviet shit, T-

34's ...

(pause)

Hey Rodriguez, don't you ever say nothing?

RODRIGUEZ

(a thick Mexican accent)

What do you want me to say, it's all the same ol'

BARNES

So what's the problem?

O'NEILL

BARNES

BARNES

O'NEILL

(shuffles, reluctant)

Bob, I got Elias' R&R ... It's coming up in 3 days.

(pause, no reaction from Barnes)

I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you ...

you'd send me in on the chopper with King ... what do

(a friendly punch)

BARNES

O'NEILL

(reflexively)

Yes sir -

RHAH

Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!

CHRIS (V.O.)

I think now, looking back, we did not fight the

enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us

... The war is over for me now, but it will always be

there - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will

be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called

possession of my soul ... There are times since I

have felt like the child born of those two fathers

... but be that as it may, those of us who did make

it have an obligation to build again, to teach to

others what we know and to try with what's left of

our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life

...

FADE OUT:
