THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS - April 1985 draft

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey.

JACK

Hey.

GIRL

Whatcha doin' over there?

JACK

Gotta go.

GIRL

How come?

JACK

Job.

GIRL

Funny hours.

JACK

Funny job.

GIRL

Will I see you again?

JACK

No.

GIRL

(at the tux)

You weren't wearing that, were

you? Earlier.

JACK

Brought it.

GIRL

Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

JACK

Thanks.

GIRL

I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone

who wore that shit.

GIRL

(continuing)

Hey.

(as he stops)

You got great hands.

DOORMAN

Hey, Jackie!

JACK

How goes it, Tommy?

TOMMY (DOORMAN)

(shrugging)

Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

JACK

Losing his teeth.

TOMMY

No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.

I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust

the taps.

JACK

Yeah.

(standing back)

Jesus, you look like fucking

royalty, Tommy.

TOMMY

Yeah.  The big boys sent it down

yesterday.

JACK

Another five years, huh?

TOMMY

Like clockwork.  You got a good

memory, Jackie.

JACK

It ain't always a blessing.  My

brother here?

TOMMY

(nodding)

He's got blood in his eye.

FRANK

Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could

make it.

JACK

How we doing?

FRANK

How we ... ? What, are you kidding

me?

JACK

Am I late?

FRANK

That's not the point.

JACK

(taking out a cigarette)

What's the point?

FRANK

You cannot continue to walk in at

the last moment, Jack.

JACK

You want me to show up late a few

nights?

FRANK

Jack.

JACK

Frank.

FRANK

Jack.

JACK

Frank.  I'm here.  I always get

here.  Don't sweat it.

FRANK

Christ, will you look at your hair?

JACK

What's wrong with it?

FRANK

You look like you just crawled out

of bed.

JACK

No one's gonna be looking at my

hair.  Come on, we're on.

JACK

(continuing)

Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your

tie starts to spin.

FRANK

(Mr.  Smile)

Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome

to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker

and eighty-eight keys across from me is my

little brother, Jack.

FRANK

(continuing; could do this in his sleep)

You know, my brother and I have been playing

together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it

been, Jack?

JACK

Twenty-eight years, Frank.

FRANK

That's a lot of water under the

bridge, eh, Jack?

JACK

Lotta water.

FRANK

Of course, back then, things were a little

different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just

about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie

Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would

listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.

(to Jack)

We must have shaved three lives off that cat,

eh, Jack?

FRANK

(continuing)

But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since

Jack and I first stepped on the stage as

professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,

and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...

well, believe me, we've seen our share of this

crazy country of ours.  But even though we've

played some of the finest venues in the world ...

FRANK

(continuing)

... There's one place that's always been, for us,

a very special place, and that place is... this

place, the Starfire lounge.

FRANK

(continuing)

Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's

the ...

(pregnant moment)

... people.

FRANK

Thank you.  Remember, room service is available

FRANK

Don't make trouble, all right?

JACK

Who's gonna make trouble?

(spotting someone)

Hey, amigo!

MAN

Jack!

(lower)

Frank.

FRANK

(the feeling's mutual)

Yeah, hi, Hector.

HECTOR (MAN)

(re: the soup bone)

For Eddie.  I wrap.

JACK

Gracias.

FRANK

(as they exit)

I mean it, Jack.  Behave.

JACK

Like an angel.

LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)

(preparing a cash envelope)

Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.

FRANK

Thanks, Lloyd.

LLOYD

Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night

like this.

FRANK

Uh ... thanks.

LLOYD

Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you

wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go

play with the niggers on State Street.  These

blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some

guy dripping ash all over himself while he's

playing 'The Sound of Music.'

LLOYD

Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more

FRANK

Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us

LLOYD

I'll call you.

FRANK

Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I

LLOYD

I'll call you.

JACK

Count it.

FRANK

Huh?

JACK

Count it.

FRANK

Jack...

JACK

Count the fucking money, Frank.

FRANK

It's all here.

(pulling Jack out)

I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

FRANK

You mind telling me what that was about in there?

Was that planned?

Or were you just bored and decided

to get creative?

JACK

Fuck him.

FRANK

This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on

Route 81, Jack.

JACK

Fuck him.

FRANK

(to himself)

Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.

JACK

So we on tomorrow night?

FRANK

(shaking his head)

Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the

Sheraton's got appendicitis.

FRANK

(continuing)

Hey.

FRANK

(continuing)

Listen ... why don't you come out to the house

this weekend.  Say hello to the kids.

They've grown.

JACK

I hate your kids, Frank.

FRANK

You're their uncle.

JACK

Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

FRANK

They don't.  They're always asking about you.

JACK

They tried to electrocute me, Frank.

FRANK

It was an accident.

JACK

It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little

one ...

FRANK

Cindy.

JACK

She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.

How do you explain that?

FRANK

She didn't know what she was doing.

You're too sensitive.

JACK

You got weird kids, Frank.

FRANK

Look, I just thought if you came out you might

see what you're missing.

FRANK

(continuing)

Just think about it, all right?

Consider it a standing offer.

FRANK

(continuing;like a litany)

You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,

I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.

Good night, Frank.

JACK

Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the

apartment.

JACK

(continuing)

Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular

Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth

around here.

FRANK

What happened to the two Clays, Willie?

WILLIE

Out.

FRANK

When they coming in?

WILLIE

Wednesday next.

Frank looks across the room at Jack.

FRANK

What d'ya got?,

JACK

Bosen black.

(taps a key)

Flat.

FRANK

What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

WILLIE

What's the gig?

FRANK

Two nights.

FRANK

(continuing)

What d'ya got?

JACK

(tapping)

Yamaha white.  Nice.

FRANK

What do you think?

JACK

Try the black Knable.

FRANK

Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,

Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.

WILLIE

My pleasure.

FRANK

You know, I think it's been five years since I

saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.

JACK

Trust me, you're not missing anything.

FRANK

You look awful.

JACK

Thanks.

FRANK

Really.  You sleeping?

JACK

Only on odd days.

FRANK

(a look)

Seeing anyone in particular?

JACK

Why the interest?

FRANK

Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about

you. Because sometimes it seems like the most

significant relationship in your life is with

that goddamn dog of yours.

JACK

I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.

FRANK

What about that waitress at the Ambassador?

JACK

Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

FRANK

Funny.

(points at his wedding band)

Strike a bell?

JACK

It's only a ring.  Not a collar.

FRANK

It's more than that.

FRANK

(continuing)

By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

JACK

No thanks.

FRANK

No, I mean it.

JACK

So do I.

FRANK

We gotta go, Jack.

JACK

No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up

there every couple weeks you feel guilty.

I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

FRANK

This time you gotta go.

JACK

I don't gotta go.

FRANK

You gotta go.

JACK

Says who?

FRANK

Your older brother.

JACK

You're thirteen months older than me, Frank.

That might've meant something in the Apache

clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.

FRANK

Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.

FRANK

(continuing)

So what do you say?

Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?

FRANK

(continuing)

Okay.  And don't worry about a present.

I got her something from both of us.

FRANK

Make sure you lock.

FRANK

Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to

mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.

Times've changed, huh?

(pointing)

See the tree?

Remember the job Cecil did on it the day

Dad planted it?

You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.

I was looking at it just the other day.

Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.

JACK

So what'd we get her?

FRANK

You'll see.

MRS. BAKER

Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

FRANK

How's the birthday girl?

MRS. BAKER

A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

MRS. BAKER

(continuing)

John.  It's good to see you.

JACK

(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)

Good to see you, Ma.

FRANK

Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.

Jack. He goes by Jack.

MRS. BAKER

I thought maybe held gotten over that.

FRANK

Twenty years, Ma ...

MRS. BAKER

Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.

Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,

we had a pig on the farm named Jack.

I guess I just can't help making the association.

FRANK

Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,

John Kennedy went by Jack.

MRS. BAKER

Catholics.  What do you expect?

Oh, well, what's in a name, right?

Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

FRANK

Keep her busy, will ya?

I have to set a few things up.

MRS.  BAKER

(entering)

Well, now, where's everyone run off to?

Frank?

JACK

Downstairs.

MRS. BAKER

Oh.

MRS. BAKER

Well, shall we cut that cake?

MRS. BAKER

So. How are you?

JACK

Fine.  You?

MRS. BAKER

Oh, fine.

MRS. BAKER

(continuing)

Big piece or little?

JACK

Huh? Oh, no.

MRS. BAKER

None?

JACK

I'm not much for sweets.

MRS. BAKER

How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

JACK

Eddie.

MRS. BAKER

Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?

JACK

He's losing his teeth.

MRS. BAKER

Sounds like your brothers back with us.

MRS. BAKER

(entering)

What's all this?

FRANK

Go on.

MRS.  BAKER

Why, what's this?

MRS. BAKER

Oh my God ...

FRANK

Recognize these two characters?

MRS. BAKER

I thought these were lost.

Where did you find ...

FRANK

In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.

(pointing with his fork)

Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.

MRS. BAKER

(laughing)

Oh no!

FRANK

I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them

all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't

fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

MRS. BAKER

Oh, look at you two.  So skinny.

And those tiny suits ...

FRANK

Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

MRS. BAKER

That man.

MRS.  BAKER (O.S.)

(continuing)

Oh, look how you're growing.

My little boys ...

JACK

I made her nervous.

FRANK

What do you mean?

JACK

Her hands.  Like that.

FRANK

Nah.  Medication.

FRANK

(continuing)

Couple years, now.

(taps his heart)

Keeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.

FRANK

She was glad to see you.

NINA

Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.

NINA

(continuing)

I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.

NINA

(continuing)

Did you break a cup, Jack?

JACK

Eddie did.

NINA

I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.

I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'

NINA

(continuing)

Guess they're up.

JACK

Sounds big.  What's he do?

NINA

Process server.

Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours

are more regular.  All I know's he came to take

the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for

dinner.  And breakfast.

JACK

What happened to the donut king?

NINA

Married.

NINA

No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.

NINA

(continuing)

Well, gotta go.  Teach me later?

JACK

Hey.

FRANK

Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this

evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed

yourselves as much as we did.

BELLHOP

Mr. Baker.

FRANK

(tired)

Yeah, Jimmy.

JIMMY (BELLHOP)

Mr. Simpson asked to see you.

FRANK

All right, tell him I'll be right there.

FRANK

(continuing)

Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'

Frank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."

It's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,

a heavy man in a shiny suit,

is throwing darts in the general direction of a

dartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.

CHARLIE

Frankie.

FRANK

You wanted to see me, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Yeah, come on in.

FRANK

Little slow tonight.

CHARLIE

(waving it off)

Mondays.

FRANK

What's this?

CHARLIE

Your pay.

FRANK

Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

CHARLIE

Take it now.

FRANK

(confused)

What about tomorrow?

CHARLIE

We don't need you, Frankie.

FRANK

I've got the grands for two nights,

Charlie.  You can't just --

CHARLIE

It's all there.  Both nights.

FRANK

What're you saying, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been

playing here, a long time.

FRANK

Twelve years.

CHARLIE

Right, twelve years.  Couple times

a month.

FRANK

So?

CHARLIE

So maybe it's time we took a vacation from

each other.

FRANK

Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.

You said so yourself.

CHARLIE

It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.

I got six waiters standing in back listening

to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.

To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.

It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.

I love both you guys, you know that.

You're class.  But people today.

They don't know class if it walks up and

grabs 'em by the balls.

JACK

What's with Charlie?

FRANK

Nothing.  Everything's great.

Terrific.

JACK

Yeah?

FRANK (V.0.)

It's me.

JACK

Frank?

FRANK (V.0.)

Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the

house tomorrow, will ya?

JACK

I've had enough family for one

month, Frank.

FRANK (V.0.)

It's not family.  It's business.

JACK

So talk to me tomorrow.  After

the gig.

FRANK (V.0.)

We don't get a gig.

JACK

What're you talking about?

FRANK (V.0.)

Something came up.  Don't worry,

Charlie stayed true.  Both nights.

I'll give you your share tomorrow.

At the house.

FRANK (V.0)

(continuing)

So you'll come out, right?

JACK

Yeah, okay.

JACK

Hey, kids.  Dad home?

JACK

(continuing)

What d'ya say?  Wanna run and get

him for me?

JACK

(continuing)

Shit.

JACK

(continuing)

Hey, kid.  Take it easy.

FRANK

Cindy!  What is it?

FRANK

(continuing)

Jack.

JACK

Your doorbell doesn't work.

FRANK

Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You

remember Uncle Jack.

DONNA

What's the matter?  Jack?

FRANK

(lifting Cindy out of the pool)

Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?

DONNA

I'll take her inside.  You too,

little Frank.  Out of the pool.

FRANK

Feet!

FRANK

(continuing)

It's probably the excitement of

seeing you again.

FRANK

Well, look at this.

DONNA

You bring trunks, Jack?

JACK

Trunks?

DONNA

Swimming trunks.

JACK

Oh. No. Strictly dryland.

DONNA

Too bad.  You could use some sun.

Really.

JACK

Maybe next time.

DONNA

We have some lotion.

JACK

Just the same.

DONNA

Suit yourself.

FRANK

Nice, huh?

JACK

What?

FRANK

The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.

JACK

Terrific.

FRANK

(expansively)

Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.

After the rains.  Look good as new.

JACK

You ask me out here to sell me

your house, Frank?

JACK

(continuing)

Charlie paid you off last night,

didn't he?

FRANK

I don't know what you mean.

JACK

The hell you don't.

FRANK

I told you.  Something came up.

Some political dinner or something.

JACK

Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank.

No one paid us off.

FRANK

It wasn't like that.

JACK

No?

FRANK

No.

JACK

What was it like?

FRANK

Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?

I got two kids. I got a wife.

Besides, he made the deal.

There's no shame in it.

JACK

That how you see it?

FRANK

Yeah, that's how I see it.

FRANK

(continuing)

And don't go shaking your head, little brother.

I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling

like he's got a day job in a piss factory.

(pause)

It killed him, you know.

JACK

A gust of wind killed him.

FRANK

Yeah, and what put him up there?

JACK

Hey, you weren't there.  Right?

FRANK

Look, can we forget last night?

We gotta talk.

JACK

Talk.

FRANK

I been thinking maybe we should

make some changes.

(pause)

I been thinking maybe we should

take on a singer.

JACK

Sure, why not.

FRANK

It's just an idea.  I want your opinion.

I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?

JACK

It's more like 40-60, wouldn't

you say?

FRANK

We agreed that if I took care of the business;

I'd be entitled to the extra.

Isn't that what we agreed?

JACK

That's what we agreed.

FRANK

If you're unhappy with the

arrangement --

JACK

I'm not unhappy.

FRANK

If you'd like to assume more of the financial

responsibilities, I'd be glad --

JACK

Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?

FRANK

I've tried to do well by you, Jack.

By both of us.

JACK

I'm grateful, Frank.  How much?

For the singer.

FRANK

I thought maybe twenty percent.

Look, with the additional bookings we'll

come out ahead.  The big hotels,

they want a pretty girl with a big voice.

We have to stay competitive, Jack.

FRANK

What's that?

JACK

You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me

we're different.  We got novelty, Jack.

No one can touch us.

FRANK

Two pianos isn't enough anymore,

Jack.

JACK

It never was.

FRANK

Good morning, Miss...?

YOUNG WOMAN

Moran.  Monica Moran.

FRANK

All right, Miss Moran

MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)

Actually, that's my stage name.

FRANK

I'm sorry?

MONICA

Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing.

It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.

FRANK

Blanche.

MONICA

No romance, right?  That's why I came up with

Monica. It's what I prefer.

FRANK

Well, that's fine --

MONICA

But if you call my house and my mother answers,

ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll

think you have the wrong number and hang up.

FRANK

Right.

MONICA

And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.

She's opposed to my career.

FRANK

Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what

is it you'd like to do for us?

MONICA

Candy Man.'

(worried)

Is that all right?

FRANK

It's one of Jack's favorites.

MONICA

Oops.  I almost forgot you were

there.  Here's the music.

FRANK

Uh... he knows it.

MONICA

Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.

JACK

Small world.

FRANK

Well, shall we?

MONICA

Who can take a sunrise

Sprinkle it with dew

Toss it in the air and

Make a groovy lemon pie

The Candy Man can

The Candy Man can...,

FRANK

Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

FRANK

(continuing)

Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...

Blanche!

MONICA

Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in

it sometimes.  It's scary.

FRANK

Yes, it is.

MONICA

Well ... thanks.

(to Jack)

Bye.

JACK

Drive carefully.

WOMAN

Hey.  You one of the fabulous

Baker Boys?

FRANK

Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

JACK

What?

FRANK

Thirty-seven girls.

And not one who can carry a tune.

That must be statistically impossible.

JACK

It was a somewhat extraordinary

day.

FRANK

I just don't understand.  You

would think someone ... anyone ...

WOMAN (O.S.)

Damn!

WOMAN

(continuing)

Brand new Thursday.  You believe

it?

WOMAN

(continuing)

This where the auditions are?

FRANK

This is where the auditions were.

WOMAN

What do you mean?

FRANK

We're finished.

WOMAN

What about me?

FRANK

You're an hour and a half late.

WOMAN

My watch is broken, too.

FRANK

Punctuality.  First rule of show

business.

WOMAN

This is show business?

FRANK

(in no mood)

Look, miss.  We're tired,

you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

WOMAN

(touching her lip)

Just like that, huh?  You're not

even gonna give me a chance?

FRANK

Don't take it personally.

WOMAN

How should I take it?

FRANK

Impersonally.

WOMAN

I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down

here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me

a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a

few minutes late.

FRANK

You're an hour and a half late.

WOMAN

So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

FRANK

We ran long.

WOMAN

So run a little longer.

FRANK

Miss --

WOMAN

You find a girl?

JACK

No.

WOMAN

So. I'm here, you're here, the

piano's here.  What d'ya say?

FRANK

Terrific.  Thirty-eight.

WOMAN

What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.

JACK

Don't worry about it.

WOMAN

(to Frank)

You know, I'm feeling a lot of

hostility from you.

FRANK

(appealing)

Jack.

JACK

Let's get it over with.

FRANK

All right.  What's your name?

WOMAN

Susie.  Susie Diamond.

FRANK

Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment

experience, Miss Diamond?

SUSIE (WOMAN)

Well ... for the last four years

I've been on call to Triple A

Escort service.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner

and dance.

FRANK

Okay.  I think that's all we

need to know.

SUSIE

I sing now?

FRANK

That's the premise.

SUSIE

I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,

okay?

SUSIE

(continuing; singing)

I get along without you very well

Of course I do

Except when soft rains fall

And drip from leaves, then I recall

The thrill of being

Sheltered in your arms

Of course I do

But I get along without you very well.'

SUSIE

(continuing)

So?

FRANK

(blinking)

Uh ... we'll let you know.

SUSIE

When?

FRANK

When we know.

SUSIE

(smiling)

Don't leave a girl hanging.

Second rule of show business.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.

JACK

What are you, crazy?

FRANK

I just thought we should talk

about it.  Between ourselves.

JACK

What's there to talk about?  She can sing.

That puts her at the head of the class.

That makes her the only one in the class.

FRANK

I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,

for Christ sake.

I don't think she's right for the act.

JACK

(studying him)

You're getting cold feet about

this.

FRANK

I was just thinking what Ma would

think.

JACK

Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the

Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass.

How could I forget.

JACK

(continuing)

How many other silent partners are there, Frank?

Donna?  Little Cindy?

Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.

FRANK

Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

JACK

What's the matter?

FRANK

I didn't get her number.

FRANK

We can always look her up in the

book.

JACK.

Right.  Susie Diamond.  She's probably listed right

next to Monica Moran.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Does this mean I get the job?

SUSIE

Intuition.

FRANK

Ready?

FRANK

(continuing)

Ready?

FRANK

(continuing)

Ready?

FRANK

(continuing)

Ready?

SUSIE

(looking around)

What are we, an orchestra all of

a sudden?

SUSIE

(continuing)

Sorry.

SUSIE

Fellas, fellas ...

FRANK

What's the problem?

SUSIE

The problem is I can't hear myself

sing with all this...

(searching)

... music.  You know what I'm saying?

SUSIE

(continuing)

I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,

but up here I'm having a little trouble

getting a word in.

SUSIE

(continuing)

I mean, you're supposed to be

backing me up, right?

FRANK

(icily)

No. We are not supposed to be

backing you up.

SUSIE

What I mean is --

FRANK

We're a team.  We work together.

SUSIE

So work with me, not against me.

Okay?

FRANK

I suppose we can bring it down a

little.

JACK

I'll drop the eighths.

FRANK

Okay?

SUSIE

Okay.

FRANK

I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got

a voice like an angel ... What?

FRANK

(continuing)

No, I wouldn't say she's got a

body like an angel.

SUSIE

Hey, he's not sore, is he?

JACK

He'll come around.

JACK

(continuing)

You never sang before?

SUSIE

Not for money. With my mother.

SUSIE

(continuing)

She used to waitress downtown, nights,

when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing.

You know how people whistle when they're nervous?

My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone

with a song 'cause thousands of people know the

same song and even though you can't hear 'em,

they're singing with you.  I don't know.

If they were, they were all singing safe inside

their apartments.

(shrugging)

But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since,

I always wanted to sing.

I never took lessons or anything, though.

I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.

JACK

Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons.

NINA

You shave like an old movie, Jack.

JACK

In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that

he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he

wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop

and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

NINA

Is that what you used to do?

JACK

My days are not the old days,

genius.

NINA

What are they?

JACK

The recent past.

NINA

Oh.

(nodding to the ceiling)

Bigfoot gets his out of a can.

JACK

How do you know?

NINA

I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

JACK

Oh?

NINA

I guess it's getting serious.

JACK

Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry

him.

NINA

I hope not.  He's already busted the springs

in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?

JACK

Ivory.

NINA

Looks old.

JACK

Older than me.

NINA

Wow.

JACK

Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow

a beard?

NINA

Why not?

JACK

Well, let's get your first prom

under the belt, okay?

NINA

What's a prom?

JACK

Ever go to church?

JACK

It's like that.  Only you gotta

dance.

FRANK

Where the hell is she?

JACK

It's early.

FRANK

I told everyone seven-fifteen.

Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.

JACK

She'll get here.

FRANK

Just like the day of the auditions,

right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?

JACK

Awe inspiring.

FRANK

Yeah, well, Your's isn't.

(taking out a comb)

Let me run a comb though it.

JACK

Get out of here.

FRANK

Come on, stand still.

JACK

Get out of here!

FRANK

It's not gonna hurt you.

JACK

I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.

FRANK

(holding his shoulder)

You hit me.

JACK

I told you I was gonna hit you.

FRANK

All right, all right.  I'm a little

tense.

JACK

You're a fucking alarm clock.

FRANK

I just wish she'd get here, that's

all.

JACK

She's here.

FRANK

Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna

wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense

to come in the back.

(walking over)

Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

SUSIE

Where's my name?

FRANK

What-?

SUSIE

And how come you guys are the only ones with

your pictures on the poster?

FRANK

We'll talk about it later.  Right

now, you gotta get changed.

SUSIE

Changed?

FRANK

Where's your dress?

SUSIE

(to Jack)

What's he talking about?

FRANK

Is there a language problem here?  Your dress.

For tonight.  Where is it?

SUSIE

Do I look like I'm naked?

FRANK

That!  You can't wear that!

SUSIE

What's wrong with it?

FRANK

It's orange!

SUSIE

(to Jack)

Am I missing something?

FRANK

Come on.

SUSIE

Hey!

FRANK

Come on.  We don't have much time.

SUSIE

Time for what?

SUSIE

If you ask me, this is pretty

stupid.

FRANK

Just look.  What do you wear?

A nine?

SUSIE

(offended)

A seven.

FRANK

My wife wears a seven.  You don't

look like a seven to me.

SUSIE

I wear a seven.

FRANK

Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?

SUSIE

(looking)

Save it for your wife.

FRANK

We're not exactly silly with time,

you know.  Jack, you find anything?

JACK

No.

FRANK

Here, how's this?

FRANK

(continuing)

Close enough.  Let's go.

SUSIE

Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I

come from there's a little girl's room and a

little boy's room and the little boys don't go

where the little girls go.

FRANK

All right, but make it quick.

(remembering)

Shoes!  What size do you wear?

SUSIE

(from the dressing room)

Nine.

FRANK

Nine?

SUSIE

Nine!

FRANK

(to himself)

Big feet.

FRANK

See anything?

JACK

(holding one up)

How about these?

FRANK

Jack, for crying out loud.  Your

bachelorhood's showing.

(seeing something)

Ah, here we go.

FRANK

Hey!  Do these come in black?

SALESMAN

I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

FRANK

I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes

or no?

SALESMAN

(glowering)

Yes.  They come in black.

FRANK

Okay.  Give me a pair of nines.

Pronto.

SALESMAN

Does he want a pair, too?

FRANK

All right, we got your shoes.

SUSIE

What do you think?

FRANK

Uh... good.

SUSIE

(turning to Jack)

Zip me up?

SUSIE

(continuing)

Shoes?

FRANK

Right.

SUSIE

They're tight.

FRANK

They're nines.

SUSIE

Well, they're aspiring to be

sevens.

FRANK

You can buy new ones tomorrow.

SUSIE

Oh, thanks.

FRANK

Don't worry.  We'll take it out

of your share.

SUSIE

You're a prince.

RAY

You better buy yourself a watch,

Frankie.

FRANK

We had a little emergency.

RAY

Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency.

You know what I'm saying?

(seeing Susie)

Who's this, Minnie Pearl?

FRANK

(moving off)

Jesus.

RAY

I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.

You hear me?

JACK

This is going well, isn't it?

FRANK

We need scissors over here!

Who's got scissors?

(turning to Susie)

Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first,

I do the set-up, then introduce you.

And you say ...

SUSIE

(deadpan)

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.

It's like a dream come true.

And speaking of dreams ...

FRANK

Right.

SUSIE

Piece of cake.

FRANK

Carlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need

scissors.

CARLOS (MAN)

No scissors.

FRANK

Jesus Christ.  All right.  Let's

go, Jack.  Fix your tie.

FRANK

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.

My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not

seeing double, it's just my

little brother, Jack.

FRANK

(continuing)

I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,

because we've got a very special

evening planned ...

WAITRESS

Hey!

SUSIE

Just a sip.  To kill the

butterflies, okay?

WAITRESS

Okay.  But no lipstick.

SUSIE

There.  No one's the wiser.

WAITRESS

Nice dress.

SUSIE

Appreciate it, Ace.

FRANK

But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,

looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help

but feel some of us have met before.  We may not

know each other's names, we might not recognize

one another on the street, but we know each other

just the same.  And over the years we've shared

something.  A little music, a little drink,

a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.

But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?

JACK

Oh, brother.

FRANK

And it's especially nice to be among friends

tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special

night for my brother and I. This evening we've

asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I

are sure will soon seem like just another old

friend to you all.  She's making her debut here

this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she

couldn't be doing it in a better place.

Because there's one place that's always been for

us a very special place, and that place is this

place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen,

please welcome a very special lady with a very

special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

FRANK

(continuing; whispering)

The switch.  Hit the switch.

SUSIE

Switch?

(as she hits it)

What fucking switch?

SUSIE

(continuing; very demure)

Pardon me.

SUSIE

(continuing)

I can't tell you how thrilled I

am to be here.

SUSIE

(continuing)

I'm all smiles, darling

Through and through...'

BELLBOY

I thought the Bakers were on

tonight.

CLERK

They are.

BELLBOY

Well, who's that?

CLERK

I don't know.  Frank?

FRANK

Fucking.  She says fucking in

front of an entire room of people.

SUSIE

I said I was sorry.

FRANK

(to Jack)

Did you hear it?

JACK

Fucking.

SUSIE

Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais

by the time I got out there anyway.

FRANK

(directly to her)

Fucking.

SUSIE

For Christ sake, I said it, I

didn't do it.

(pulling out some bills)

Besides, I don't think they were

too offended, do you?

FRANK

(grabbing the bills)

Give me that.

SUSIE

Hey!

FRANK

We are not a saloon act.  We do

not take tips from dirty old men.

SUSIE

(innocent)

I was gonna split it with you guys.

FRANK

We do not take tips.  I'll apply

this to the cost of the dress.

SUSIE

Then I want my name on the poster.

And my picture!

(taking off her shoes)

And these shoes are too goddamn tight!

JACK

Nice girl.

LLOYD

Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched

onto.  She a local?

FRANK

Born and bred.

LLOYD

Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.

Don't spend it all in one place.

Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?

FRANK

We trust you, Lloyd.  You know

that.

LLOYD

Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here...

How's next week look for you guys?

JACK

We'll call you.

SUSIE

Night, Bakers.

WOMAN

Barker.

(no takers)

Jock Barker?

JACK

(realizing it's him)

Baker.  Jack Baker.

WOMAN

Right.  Bring him back.

JACK

Come on, Ed.

WOMAN

You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.

The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.

JACK

He doesn't bite.

WOMAN

They never do, Mr. Barker.

JACK

Baker.

WOMAN

Right.  In there.

JACK

You shoulda brushed, pal.

DR. BEASLEY (MAN)

Ah, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.

Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.

DR. BEASLEY

Beasley.

JACK

Baker.

DR. BEASLEY

What's our friend's problem?

JACK

Teeth.

DR. BEASLEY

What's wrong with them?

JACK

They're falling out.

DR. BEASLEY

Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's

get him up here.

DR. BEASLEY

They gotta go.

JACK

(a take)

How many?

DR. BEASLEY

Five's my guess.  Maybe more.

Won't know till I get in there.

(consulting his clipboard)

Leave him now and you can pick

him up in the morning.

JACK

Isn't there something you can

give him?  A pill or something?

DR. BEASLEY

Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to

the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.

Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,

would we?

JACK

How will he eat?

DR. BEASLEY

Start him out on cottage cheese.

If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a

few minutes.  Go down like pudding

through a hot pipe.

JACK

No bones?

DR. BEASLEY

No bones.

JACK

What do you do to him?

DR. BEASLEY

Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out.

He won't feel a thing.

JACK

I think maybe I'll bring him back

next week ...

DR. BEASLEY

The sooner we do this the better,

Mr. Baker.

FRANK

The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the

Carlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns.

What do you think, Jack?

FRANK

(continuing)

Jack, you with us?

SUSIE

The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum.

And they water their drinks.

It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

FRANK

(watching)

I guess it's,the Plaza then.

That brings us to the twenty-seventh.

We got the Avedon for three or the Park

downtown for two.

SUSIE

We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

SUSIE

(continuing)

The Park?  It's only two nights.

Why throw away a night?

JACK

Because Blackie Carson books the Park and

whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

SUSIE

Oh.

(lifting her glass)

Well, for Blackie then.

FRANK

By the way, I got a messsage

yesterday from some guy looking for

New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.

SUSIE

(likes "resort')

Hey.

JACK

Sounds like a booking agent

looking to book an easy fee.

FRANK

That's what I figure.  Probably have us in

a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

SUSIE

Maybe it's legit.

FRANK

Maybe.  I'll call him.

JACK

Make it collect.

FRANK

(shuffling his slips)

That's it except for the first.

We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the

Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.

JACK

Draw.

SUSIE

How'd you guys used to decide what

gig to take?

FRANK

Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

SUSIE

So find a dime.  Let's get out

of here.

FRANK

Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.

Where're your gloves?

FRANK

(continuing)

Better take care of your fingers, little brother.

Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't

be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

JACK

I'll take my chances.

FRANK

Something, huh?  All those bids.

JACK

Yeah.  Something.

FRANK

Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

JACK

You wanna get a drink?

FRANK

No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been

up two nights making sure the rest of us

don't get it.

FRANK

(continuing)

You all right?

JACK

Yeah, fine.

FRANK

Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

JACK

Right.

SUSIE

Where's egghead?

JACK

His kid's sick.

SUSIE

(searching her purse)

I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two

as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've

scrambled the babies somewhere.

JACK

He takes after our mother.

SUSIE

Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be

one crazy dame.  Shit.

SUSIE

Uh-uh.  I never touch American

cigarettes.

(still searching)

What's tomorrow again?

JACK

The Stratford.

SUSIE

Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even

the bedspreads.

(shaking the purse)

Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go

through 'em like toothpicks.

Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,

you believe that?

JACK

Huh?

SUSIE

Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat

down with a pencil and added it one day.  But

I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something

in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.

(finding one)

Ah, here's a lost soul.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well,

au revoir.

JACK

Hey.

(as she stops)

You feel like a cup of coffee?

SUSIE

You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in

there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

JACK

You want me to walk you?

SUSIE

No. Thanks.

She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are

you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me

and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like

I'm some kinda princess when I burp.

JACK

Forget it.

SUSIE

I mean, that'd be too creepy.

With us working together and all.

JACK

Forget it.

SUSIE

Nothing personal --

JACK

Better hurry.  You're a nickel

down on your cigarette.

KID

Yeah?

KID

(continuing)

You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a

bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.

JACK

No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.

He needed some work on his mouth.

KID

Regular hours are eight to five.

JACK

Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by.

Thought I'd check in on him.

KID

You can check in on him tomorrow.

Between eight and five.

JACK

Yeah, well, couldn't I take a

look now?

KID

You want to know if he's okay.

Right?

JACK

(uncomfortable)

Yeah.

KID

All right.  Hold on.

JACK

The name's Baker --

KID

Save it.  What's he look like?

JACK

(puzzled)

Black.  Labrador.

KID

All right. they lay the dead ones out in the

cold room.  I'll take a look.

KID

Nope.  Just a couple poodles.

NINA

I tried Cheerios this morning.

He didn't even get up.

Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

JACK

He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it,

pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

JACK

(continuing)

Chili.

JACK

(nodding to the ceiling)

You're gonna knock her dead, kid.

JACK

Hey, Frank.

FRANK

You recognized me.

JACK

Just a lucky guess.

FRANK

So what do you think?

JACK

Very realistic.

FRANK

(not buying it)

Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had

forty pounds on me.

Jesus, you remember him being this big?

JACK

Yeah.

FRANK

Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.

Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.

FRANK

You want to come out to the house tomorrow?

The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided

to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the

whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can

hardly move.  We could use another appetite.

JACK

Thanks, but I've got plans.

FRANK

All right, but if you change your mind,

let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the

morning anyway.

SUSIE

(coming up)

Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You

moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?

FRANK

For the kids.

(moving off)

Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't

forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

SUSIE

He do that every year?

JACK

Every year.

SUSIE

Aren't the kids asleep?

JACK

Every year.

SUSIE

So why's he do it?

JACK

I guess in case one year they're not.

SUSIE

Call me a cab, will ya?

NINA

How'd the show go?

JACK

Okay.  How'd yours go?

NINA

Not so good.

NINA

Eggnog?

NINA

(continuing)

From Hurley's?

JACK

Eighty proof. What d'ya say?

Think you can handle it?

NINA

Jack.

JACK

Yeah?

NINA

Can I stay here tonight?  Even if

she comes here?

JACK

Sure.

He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.

NINA

Merry Christmas, Jack.

JACK

Merry Christmas.

NINA

What do you think?

JACK

Very cool.

NINA

(looking around)

There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi

down at the drugstore says it's going to snow

by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows.

I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman.

You ever make a snowman, Jack?

JACK

Sure.

NINA

That's what I want to do.

I want to make a snowman.

NINA

(continuing)

Now?

NINA

(continuing)

Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.

JACK

Hey, Eddie.  Have some respect,

will ya?

FRANK

So. How was everyone's Christmas?

FRANK

(continuing)

Too early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts

for whoever wants them.

How about a maple bar, Jack?

FRANK

(continuing)

Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.

FRANK

(continuing)

By the way, if anyone gets bored,

Donna packed some travel games.

They work wonders with the kids.

FRANK

(continuing)

You two could play checkers.

SUSIE

Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

FRANK

Sorry.  It only plays static.

SUSIE

How long did you say it takes to

get to this place?

FRANK

Any more coffee?

SUSIE

Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this?

SUSIE

(continuing)

You play all these places?

FRANK

Baker's unabridged.

SUSIE

Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of

noise.  What's with the stars?

FRANK

Virgins.

SUSIE

Virgins?

FRANK

First times. Hey, look at this.

FRANK

(continuing)

When's the last time we played a

wedding, Jack?

JACK

Two years ago.  March.

SUSIE

(consulting the ledger)

He's right.

FRANK

He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

FRANK

(continuing)

Go ahead.

SUSIE

(scanning the book)

Okay.The Fantasy Inn.

FRANK

Jack?

JACK

(staring out the window)

November.  '71.

FRANK

First night?

JACK

Day.  Wednesday.

FRANK

Last?

JACK

Sunday.

SUSIE

I don't believe it.

FRANK

I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music.

Hears it once and he's got it.

Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.

FRANK

(continuing)

My brilliant little brother.

FRANK

Will you listen to that ocean?

FRANK

(continuing)

And how about this air? I'm telling you,

a few days in this place'll put five years

on your life.

SUSIE

Smells like fish.

FRANK

Of course it smells like fish.

We're on the ocean.

What'd you expect, Chanel number five?

SUSIE

(to herself)

Smells like tuna number two to me.

FRANK

It's paradise.  That's what it is.

Paradise.

FRANK

Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.

CLERK

Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific

Tom.

FRANK

No. We're the entertainment.

TOM (CLERK)

Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?

FRANK

Outside.  Blue Chevy.

TOM

(ringing a bell)

Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up

to the Guinevere Suite.

TOM

(continuing)

Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker.

You can practically dangle your toes

in the water.

FRANK

You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting

away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest

of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.

SUSIE

Hey, we're connected.

FRANK

Great.

SUSIE

Great?

FRANK

Yeah.

JACK

I thought we had separate rooms.

FRANK

(opening drawers)

We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.

Wash and Dries.

JACK

I thought we all had separate rooms.

FRANK

Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first

time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when

we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.

SUSIE

You're kidding me.

FRANK

As Charlie Steinway is my witness.

SUSIE

Peggy Lee?

FRANK

Tell her.

JACK

She was staying at the Grand

downtown ...

FRANK

It was April.  April seventeenth.

That one I remember.

JACK

We were playing the lounge one

night and she came in.

FRANK

Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

JACK

Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said

yes, and we did a few bars.

FRANK

A few bars!

SUSIE

What'd she sing?

FRANK

People.' You think Streisand, right?

Hot that night.  Chills.

Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

SUSIE

Wow. You ever see her again?

FRANK

No. We got a picture, though.

One of the waitresses had a camera.

(to Jack)

God, we were just kids.  That was

something, wasn't it?

FRANK

(continuing)

Hey, will you look at that?

SUSIE

They must've bought the same

map we did.

FRANK

What do you say we send a bottle

over?

SUSIE

I don't believe it.  You're a

romantic, Frank.

JACK

He's drunk.

FRANK

Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

SUSIE

Oh yeah?

FRANK

He's just afraid to show it.

Aren't you, little brother?

JACK

Have some more wine, Frank.

FRANK

Good idea.

(lifting his glass)

To Peggy Lee.

FRANK

I'm putting my stuff on the right,

okay?

JACK

Okay.

FRANK

I figure that way we won't get confused.

JACK

Right.

FRANK

Unless you want the right.

JACK

No, you take the right.

FRANK

We might as well do the towels the same way.

JACK

Okay.

FRANK

I just figure things'll go smoother, you know,

if we have it all worked out from the beginning.

JACK

Good idea.

FRANK

But if it doesn't work out, let

me know.  I'm,flexible.

JACK

Right.

JACK

(continuing; re: the bathroom light)

You leaving that on?

FRANK

Yeah.

JACK

All night?

FRANK

Yeah.

JACK

We're gonna be here a week?

FRANK

(puzzled)

Yeah.

JACK

So you're gonna leave it on.

Every night.  For a week.

FRANK

Yeah.  You mind?

JACK

Why would I mind?

FRANK

I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.

I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

FRANK

(continuing)

Oh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.

It was never a big deal then.  Was it?

FRANK

(continuing)

Oh. Well.  You want me to turn

it off?

FRANK

(continuing)

I'll turn it off.

JACK

Forget it.  It's no big deal.

FRANK

They're beauties, huh?

FRANK

(continuing)

Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.

FRANK

(continuing)

What?

MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)

Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels,

the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you

on the phone.

FRANK

(offering his hand)

That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.

This is my brother Jack.

MR. DANIELS

Tom here tells me there's a problem with the

pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

FRANK

Yes, well, they are.

MR. DANIELS

Then I'm afraid I don't understand.

FRANK

They are in tune.  But not with

each other.

MR. DANIELS

Is that important?

FRANK

Uh, well ...

JACK

Yes.  It's important.

MR. DANIELS

Tom, who're we dealing with on

these?

TOM

A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation.

I called this morning.

MR. DANIELS

Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.

Not being a musician myself I find it difficult

to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose

there's any way you could just ... accommodate.

JACK

Accommodate?  I don't think I know

what you mean.

FRANK

I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,

Jack, is --

JACK

Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell

us what he's trying to say.

MR. DANIELS

I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.

I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?

FRANK

Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like

a kid.

JACK

No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around

one of these assholes and you turn into a

fucking three-year-old.

FRANK

What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a

little out of tune.  So what?

JACK

(stopping)

Christ, can't you hear it?

FRANK

No! I never hear it!

(shaking his head)

Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know.

But I won't let it bother me.

JACK

Doesn't it matter to you?

FRANK

What matters to me is we've got the six easiest

nights we've had in ten years.

So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.

So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody.

So why should you care?

JACK

Because I can hear it.

FRANK

Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because

come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that

dining room with smiles on.

Understand, little brother?

SUSIE

Hey, fellas.  What's the word?

SUSIE

(continuing)

What's with you two?

FRANK

Jack woke up on the wrong side

of the bottle.

SUSIE

0-kay.

FRANK

Thank you, thank you.

(as applause dies)

You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived

here yesterday, but already the people here at the

King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,

well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,

before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part

of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days,

we should happen to pass one another in the hallway

or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.

Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here,

there are no strangers, only friends.

And family.  Right, Jack?

JACK

Right.  I love you, Frank.

FRANK

(stunned)

What?

JACK

I love you.  I just wanted to say it.

FRANK

Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.

(moving quickly along)

So. Susie.  How 'bout it.

SUSIE

Huh?

FRANK

Got another song for us?

SUSIE

Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.

FRANK

Well then ... shall we?

FRANK

(whispering)

What's the matter with you?

JACK

I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family.

I just got emotional.

FRANK

How dare you say you love me.

JACK

It won't happen again.  Scout's

honor.

SUSIE

What's with you guys?

FRANK

Someone needs to grow up.  I won't

take it, Jack.

JACK

Sure you will.

SUSIE

Oh, sorry.  With the light always

on, it's hard to tell.

JACK

It's okay.

(the cigarette)

Last one.

SUSIE

Can't sleep?

JACK

In and out.

SUSIE

It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say.

She was crazy for the ocean.

JACK

Yeah, well, I wish God would go

a little easy on the trumpets.

SUSIE

How's egghead?

JACK

Like a baby. You?

SUSIE

In and out.

SUSIE

(continuing)

If you want, I got a pack in the

room.

JACK

No thanks.  I never touch French

cigarettes.

JACK

What the hell are you doing?

FRANK

(not looking up)

What's it look like I'm doing?

I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

JACK

Really.

FRANK

Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy,

Jack.  If you say it's out of tune,

it's out of tune.

JACK

How's it coming?

FRANK

Fine.

JACK

How long you been at it?

FRANK

(shrugging)

Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna

get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?

JACK

They stopped serving two hours ago.

FRANK

Two hours ago!

JACK

Time flies, huh?

JACK

(continuing)

I could give you a hand.  If

you want.

FRANK

What do you make that?  Paruchi?

FRANK

(continuing)

You haven't seen Susie, have you?

JACK

No. Why?

FRANK

Just wonder what she's up to.

I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

JACK

She's a big girl.

FRANK

Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better

keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.

(another card)

Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.

Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?

JACK

What the hell are these?

FRANK

Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road.

See, every morning the maids drop one of these

cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card,

leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play

it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.

(whispering)

And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine

o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking

about our availability.  Like he wants to line

something up.

I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.

WOMAN

Excuse me.

WOMAN

I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting

here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

FRANK

Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my

brother.

FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)

Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you

play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.

FRANK

Oh. Well, thank you.

FLORENCE SIMMONS

No, I mean you.

(to Jack)

I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.

Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry

in your family tree, do you?

JACK

Afraid not.

FLORENCE SIMMONS

Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.

Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,

I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn

mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.

Can imagine?

FLORENCE SIMMONS

(continuing)

Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was

no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.

FRANK

Funny, huh?

JACK

What?

FRANK

Thinking there's someone who looks like you,

walking around the street somewhere.

(smiling)

Wonder if I saw him I'd think it

was you?

FLORENCE SIMMONS

I just know my sister won't believe

me. Do you mind?

FLORENCE SIMMONS

I really hate to impose.  It's just that the

resemblance is so extraordinary.

(focusing)

I wonder if you could turn this way so your face

isn't in the shadows.

FLORENCE SIMMONS

Say cheese.

FLORENCE SIMMONS

(continuing)

Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for

yourself?  The hotel develops.

JACK

No.

FRANK

Thank you.  You know, before we came out here

this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking

over your dedications and something struck us.

FRANK

(continuing)

We realized that, well, we're really not so

different from one another after all.  Oh sure,

we may be at different points in our journey,

but we all travel pretty much the same road.

And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce

you to two very special couples.  First, married

for all of two days, please say hello to Helen

and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.

FRANK

(continuing)

And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about

Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,

Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told

you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?

Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane

have been married for seventy-five years!

FRANK

(continuing)

Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and

show these kids how it's done.

FRANK

(continuing)

Aren't they a sight?

SUSIE

(opening door)

Forget your tie, handsome ...

Frank!

FRANK

You want to tell me what the

hell's going on?

SUSIE

Huh?

FRANK

I just saw a man walk out of

your room.

SUSIE

Uh ...

FRANK

In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be

here.  So it might be nice if you conducted

yourself with a certain amount of decency.

SUSIE

Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...

FRANK

No. You listen.  I had my doubts

about you from the beginning

JACK

Hey!

JACK

(continuing)

What're you trying to do?  Wake

up the whole goddamn hotel?

FRANK

We were just having a little

discussion about morality.

SUSIE

Some discussion.

FRANK

I just saw a man walk out of your

room!

JACK

You saw wrong.

FRANK

Huh?

JACK

He's with the hotel.  I called him.

FRANK

What are you talking about?

JACK

We had a leak in the bathroom.

He fixed it.

FRANK

He was wearing a suit.

JACK

He had to come quickly.  It was

a big leak.

FRANK

How come I didn't hear anything?

JACK

You're a heavy sleeper, Frank.

You've always-been a heavy sleeper.

(looking at Susie)

Unlike me.

FRANK

I guess I ... If I jumped to...

SUSIE

Forget it.

FRANK

Well...

SUSIE

Boy, he comes on like a hurricane

in the morning, doesn't he?

SUSIE

(continuing)

Yeah, well, thanks for sticking

your head in.

JACK

Hey, business is business.

SUSIE

It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

JACK

Just dinner and dance, right?

SUSIE

Paradise.

FRANK

(into phone)

Yes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the

little glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.

It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything

... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...

Who? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy,

okay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year.

(waits)

Hi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for

Christmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't

know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.

Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell

her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?

Without the training wheels?

(affected by this)

Well, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait

to see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ...

Okay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten

minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...

FRANK

(continuing)

Well, let's go.  The public waits.

FRANK

(yelling to be heard)

All right, everyone.  This is it.

Let's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...

FRANK/EVERYONE

Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.

Four.  Three.  Two!  ONE!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

SUSIE/EVERYONE

Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...

FRANK

Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.

Happy New Year, little brother.

JACK

What're you doing down here?

FRANK

Celebrating.  Join me?

JACK

The party's over.

FRANK

No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning.

Come on, have a drink.

Show your big brother how it's done.

JACK

Expensive hangover.

FRANK

A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous

hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.

(toasting Jack)

We, dear brother, are a fucking

smash.

(nodding)

Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they

have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.

Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with

Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais

and everyone has a grand time crawling around on

the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a

dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in

a different colored shell and at the end of the

evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job

to separate the yolks from the whites.

Slippery business.

FRANK

(continuing)

You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.

Not once in twelve years.

FRANK

The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?

With the blue glass.

JACK

The Royal.

FRANK

Right.  The Royal.  When's the

last time we were there?

JACK

Couple years.

FRANK

February?

JACK

April.

FRANK

Right.  It's incredible how you

do that.  Remember things.

JACK

A useless talent.

FRANK

Drove me crazy when we were kids.

The way you never looked at the music.

Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

JACK

They were simple songs.

FRANK

Not for me.  I still have to look at the music

sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget.

I just forget.  But you.  You never forget.

Ever.

(turning)

So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

JACK

I told you.  It's a useless talent.

FRANK

God, the old man would've loved

this view, wouldn't he?

JACK

Yeah.

FRANK

I always think of him on New Year's.

How he used to pour us each half a can of beer.

Remember?

JACK

You always threw up.

FRANK

Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.

He loved that about you.

JACK

He was just having fun.

FRANK

It was like you'd passed some test,

you know?

JACK

It was just a can of beer, Frank.

FRANK

Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me

anything.  Even though I was the oldest.

It was always you two, running off, doing things

together.

JACK

You could've come.

FRANK

I could've.  But he didn't want

me to.

JACK

You're making things up, Frank.

FRANK

Maybe so.

(pause)

You ever go back there?  Where it

happened.

JACK

No.

FRANK

Want one?

FRANK

(continuing)

Ah well, the kids'll break a

couple anyway.

BUD

Give me the keys.

HELEN

You're not going to drive.

BUD

Give me the keys!

HELEN

You're not going to drive!

BUD

It's my goddamn car!

HELEN

It's our goddamn car!

BUD

Give me the keys.

HELEN

No.

FRANK

I think I'll warm up the car.

FRANK

That takes care of this week.  The tenth we

got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're

at the Capri.

JACK

The tenth's out.

FRANK

What?

JACK

I can't make the tenth.

FRANK

What do you mean?

JACK

I mean maybe you should check with us before you

go off and book us a month in advance.

FRANK

Be reasonable, Jack.

JACK

I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.

How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

FRANK

How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah

this weekend?

SUSIE

(distracted)

Huh?

FRANK

Forget it.

SUSIE

Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings

... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...

SUSIE

I can't sing it anymore.

FRANK

What?

SUSIE

That song.  I can't sing it anymore.

I'm gonna get sick.

FRANK

What're you talking about?  They

love it.

SUSIE

I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.

Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

FRANK

(as to a child)

Susie.  It's one more show.  One

more time.  That's all.

SUSIE

And two more times tomorrow night, and two more

times the next night, and the next night and the

next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't

sing that fucking song anymore!

SUSIE

(continuing)

I need some air.

JACK

You're gonna wear down those

heels if you don't give it a rest.

She stops.

JACK

(continuing)

Relax.  We'll drop the song.

SUSIE

Guess I got a little scattered.

JACK

It's a shitty  song.

SUSIE

How do you do it? Every night?

JACK

Practice.

(pause)

There are worse songs, you know.

Not many, but a few.

SUSIE

Listen...

(looks into his eyes)

Nothing.

HENRY

Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake

things up here every so often just to keep you

people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little

rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit

in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep

his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.

Jack Baker.

SUSIE (O.S.)

You were good.

JACK

I can keep the beat.

SUSIE

Better than that.

SUSIE

What's the matter?

JACK

Nothing.

SUSIE

What'd I say?

JACK

Nothing.

SUSIE

You're upset.

JACK

I'm not upset.

SUSIE

All I said was you were good.

JACK

(stops)

Look. You don't know good. All right?

SUSIE

What's that supposed to mean?

JACK

It means you wouldn't know good

if it came up and fucked you.

SUSIE

You were good.

JACK

Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

SUSIE

You were good.

JACK

(exasperated)

How do you know?

SUSIE

(yelling)

Because I saw the other people!

And they knew you were good!

You were good, goddamnit!

SUSIE

(continuing)

So you wanna get a drink?

JACK

Nina?

SUSIE

Who's Nina?

JACK

Friend.

SUSIE

Friend?  What's she look like?

Maybe I can help you find her.

JACK

She's four feet tall.  Ed?

SUSIE

Ed? How many people live here?

JACK

I have to make him some chili.

Okay?

SUSIE

(a look)

Sure.

SUSIE

(at window)

Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.

When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before

the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a

wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights

of the city and string them into-a necklace for

myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her

eyes, I don't know, it was like she really

believed it.

JACK

How come you didn't close your eyes?

SUSIE

I don't know.  I guess I didn't

trust the night like she did.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Let me have a cigarette, will you?

All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Long story.

SUSIE

(continuing)

You know, I saw you guys once.

You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.

JACK

Must've been a cheap date.

SUSIE

Soap convention.

JACK

Soap?

SUSIE

Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At

least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I

was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The

older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled

the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...

(shaking her head)

Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you

can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with

him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.

But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with

palms like a baby.

SUSIE

(continuing)

It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of

steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually

whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.

Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me

four dozen roses.

(almost wistful)

But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see

the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.

Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to

believe sleeping in a room like that don't change

your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but

the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.

(pause)

I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...

SUSIE

(continuing)

Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.

SUSIE

(continuing)

So what's this?

JACK

History.

SUSIE

Huh?

JACK

My father proposed to my mother

in there.

SUSIE

No kidding?

SUSIE

(continuing)

The both of them?  In there?

JACK

He called her.

SUSIE

Oh. So what's it doing here?

JACK

Long story.

SUSIE

You sending me home?

JACK

They'd been out dancing all night and he took

her to the train station -- she lived over in

Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this

time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home,

only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

SUSIE

Nervous?

JACK

By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's

got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the

rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading

about it in the morning edition.

SUSIE

You're kidding.

JACK

He had a mind that escalated things.

SUSIE

So, what happened?

JACK

He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks

he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks

he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing

you know he's got his brothers down there and

they're tearing the thing right off the curb.

JACK

(continuing)

I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was

gonna try and call her.

SUSIE

Wow.  But I still don't see how ...

JACK

Ma didn't want it around.  After.

SUSIE

Oh.

SUSIE

(continuing, carefully)

Frank said you saw him die.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Frank said ---

JACK

Frank wasn't 'there.

JACK

He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a

lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean.

He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it.

It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd

go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.

To make me laugh.

(pause)

He drank a lot that day.

JACK

(continuing)

There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo

shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to

do the jig.  One minute he was there ...

(shrugs)

I thought it was a joke at first.

He did things like that.  Games.

(pause)

I was laughing when it happened.

JACK

You got pretty eyes, you know that.

JACK

You gotta move 'em around if you want to

play a song.

SUSIE

Oh. Hi.  Sorry.

JACK

Coffee?

SUSIE

Yeah... No.

JACK

Look, if you want to leave...

SUSIE

Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!

SUSIE

(continuing)

Shit.  I think I started a fire.

JACK

If our feet get hot, you grab

the piano.

JACK

(continuing)

Why don't you go.  I'll see you

tomorrow night at the Ambassador.

SUSIE

I followed you last night.  I

mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was

about to come up when you came out.

SUSIE

(continuing)

The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...

I'm leaving.  The act.

SUSIE

(continuing)

It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked

my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat

food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?

SUSIE

(continuing)

You can always get another girl.

JACK

(looks out window)

There's always another girl.

NICK

Sick?  How sick?

FRANK

The flu.

NICK

So she's got a few sniffles.

FRANK

Doctor's orders.

NICK

You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.

It's unethical.

FRANK

Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

NICK

What am I gonna do?  Put a record

player out there?

(exiting)

Bad, Frankie.  Bad.

JACK

(to Frank)

What're you doing?

FRANK

Just until we find another girl.

JACK

Cancel, Frank.

FRANK

You want to know how much I got tied up in

deposits with Willie?  We're in for three

weeks solid, Jack.

JACK

Better give her pneumonia.

GIRL (O.S.)

Remember me?

GIRL

Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time

you guys were looking for a singer.

(smiling)

Perseverance.  First rule of show business.

MONICA (GIRL)

I bought a book.  That's what it says.

FRANK

We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a

couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me

know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.

FRANK

(continuing)

I got some calls out.  Things

that might be good for us.

FRANK

(continuing)

We'll try for a girl again next

week.

FRANK

(continuing)

Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.

FRANK

You know, my brother and I have been playing

together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

JACK

Twenty-eight years.

FRANK

Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little

different.  We were just kids.  Just about the

only one who would listen to us was the family

cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old

Cecil, huh, Jack?

FRANK

(continuing; hanging tough)

Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in

the Roosevelt Room, because this has always

been ...

FRANK

(continuing)

a very special place for Jack and I.

(recovering)

And tonight we'd like to open with a very special

song.  It's the song my mother and father danced

to the night they were married.  This is for them.

FRANK

You should've told us you were coming, Ma.

We would've come and got you.

MRS.  BAKER

Spur of the moment.

FRANK

So what'd you think?

MRS.  BAKER

Thrilling.

(glancing at Jack)

Both of you.

FRANK

The audience was a little off

tonight.

MRS.  BAKER

A few empty tables.  It's cozier.

Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place

on a Wednesday night.

FRANK

I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we

get a little midnight snack?

Theo's should still be open.

MRS.  BAKER

No, no.  You boys are tired.

FRANK

No, we're not.  Jack?

JACK

No.

MRS.  BAKER

I'm tired.  Really.  I should get

home.

FRANK

You sure?

MRS.  BAKER

(nodding)

Just call me a cab.

FRANK

A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half

block down.  You wait here.

MRS.  BAKER

(smiling)

All right.

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

It's beautiful, isn't it?

JACK

Yeah.

MRS.  BAKER

This was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On

Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom

upstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers.

White tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch

bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

It went well tonight.

JACK

Frank works hard.

MRS.  BAKER

And you don't?

JACK

He leads, I follow.

MRS.  BAKER

Is that the way it is?

JACK

Pretty much.

MRS.  BAKER

He mentioned you had a girl for

a while.  A singer.

JACK

For a while.  She left.

MRS.  BAKER

Yes, well, it's probably best.

No sense bringing someone else in.

JACK

I suppose.

MRS.  BAKER

Funny.  Watching tonight, I was

remembering when you were young.

How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to

the two of you practice while I did the dishes.

(smiling)

My two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to

the door and just watch.  Sometimes your father

would too.

(pause)

He liked to listen to you play.

Did you know that?

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

You miss him, don't you?

JACK

It's been a long time, Ma.

MRS.  BAKER

Yes.

(pause)

I supposed you still have that old phone booth.

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

His love scared me, you know.  The day he died he

left a flower on my pillow.

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

You look so like him.

FRANK

Your limo's ready, Ma.

MRS.  BAKER

All right.

MRS.  BAKER

(continuing)

Good night, Jack.

JACK

Sorry.

JACK

We're not getting paid then.

FRANK

No.

JACK

Nothing. We get nothing.

FRANK

I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon.

No one gets a cent.

JACK

(a pause)

What's it for?

FRANK

I don't know. Some disease.

JACK

What disease?

FRANK

I don't know.

JACK

You don't know?

FRANK

It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it.

It's not a moral decision.

JACK

(another pause)

What channels it on?

FRANK

Seventy-one

JACK

Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?

FRANK

(defensive)

A channel.

It's just a little further down the dial, that's all.

Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

JACK

Right.

FRANK

The guy said to find Studio E and

turn right.  What's that say?

YOUTH

Fast break!

FRANK

I guess it's that way.

FRANK

This must be it.  I'll see when

we're on.

EARL (MAN)

You the magician?

JACK

No.

EARL

(disappointed)

Oh.  What do you do?

JACK

Piano.

EARL

(hopeful)

Two at a time?

JACK

My brother and I. One each.

EARL

(disappointed again)

Oh.

JACK

(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)

What's wrong with the kid?

EARL

Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right

before the accident.

JACK

Accident?

EARL

The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to

buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank

returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

FRANK

We're on after Meadowlark.

(seeing Jack's face)

What's wrong?

JACK

Are you kidding me?  Are you

fucking kidding me?

FRANK

What?

JACK

We're playing for a goddamn

gymnasium!

FRANK

(worried)

What?

VINCE

Let's hear it for our own Jimmy

Marshall, shall we?

VINCE

(continuing)

As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist

on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant

High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us

Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...

if there is a next season.

(Uncle Sam)

That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.

Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the

streets and in the gym where they belong.

VINCE

(continuing)

All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about

our next guest?

(consulting a card)

He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with

us two of the most respected men in the musical

entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me

when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I

say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker

Boys!  Come on out here guys.

VINCE

(continuing)

Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice

suits, fellas.

(to camera)

Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out

there are going to want to rap with these guys and

don't worry.  Right after they finish up here,

they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we

can even convince them to raffle off a few piano

lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?

VINCE

(continuing)

Well, all right then.  What are we

waiting for?  Take it away, guys.

VINCE

(continuing)

Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's

time to turn the board over.

(to Jack, Frank)

I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.

Let's bring out the board.

FRANK

Jack ...

VINCE

What the --

JACK

(pointing)

You're a fucking creep, you know

that.  I oughta kick your ass.

FRANK

(whispering)

Jack, you're on television.

JACK

Shut up, Frank.

EARL

What do you say we go for a walk,

pal.

JACK

Get your hand off me.

EARL

Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you.

Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget

what you're angry about.

JACK

Go fuck yourself.

EARL

(eyes go hard)

You're a real tough guy when the

ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

JACK

I don't see any ladies here.

Except maybe you.

FRANK

Hey, leave him alone.

EARL

Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.

JACK

You're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't

you know the man's supposed to lead?

EARL

Who do you think you are, asshole?

Liberace?

FRANK

Jack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a

tuxedo.  Three hundred dollars.

(pause)

You gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous

silent act?  Look, it was for publicity.

Do you understand?  Publicity.

JACK

What-are you?  A fucking moron?

It's three o'clock in the morning,

Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?

Maybe you can get us a gig playing

Little Frank's birthday party.

What do you think?

FRANK

Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on

until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?

I had the pianos anyway.

JACK

Basketballs, Frank.  You had us

playing for basketballs.

FRANK

I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed

up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle

of a gig.

JACK

(incredulous)

What?

FRANK

It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.

A stupid-ass stunt.

JACK

What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing

ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let

that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were

always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.

What's happened to your dignity?

FRANK

Dignity?  Who the hell are you to

talk about dignity?

FRANK

(continuing)

This where you get your dignity, Jack?

This is where you get your courage?

FRANK

(continuing)

No, let's do it straight for

once, shall we?

FRANK

(continuing)

Let me explain something to you, little brother.

See, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got

a wife and two children who expect to wake up every

morning with food on the table and heat in the house.

I got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's

medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.

Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so

fucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't

you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes

and blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.

But I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little

brother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out

in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go

on living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,

but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I

folded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,

little brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.

FRANK

(continuing)

Great.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,

Jack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another

bottle of courage on your way home.

(pause)

That's what he'd do.

FRANK

(continuing)

You've found the perfect solution to all the

pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?

Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or

night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.

You're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.

JACK

Stay off it.

FRANK

No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of

watching you make him up into some kinda god.

For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid

bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He

wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.

JACK

(eerily cold)

You weren't there.

FRANK

That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the

luxury of being a witness to tragedy.

JACK

(coiled)

Fuck you.

FRANK

No, fuck you.  And fuck him too.

Fuck the both-of you.

FRANK

(continuing)

Hey, what're you doing?  Hey!

FRANK

(continuing; scared)

Jack! ... Jack! ...

JACK

How's it feel to have your little brother beat

the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!

FRANK

My hands!  My hands!

JACK

(mocking)

Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue

ribbon on amateur night.

FRANK

(terrified)

Jack!

JACK

Who's weak now, big brother?

FRANK

Jack!  JACK!

JACK

I'm through with it.  I can't do

it anymore.

CINDY (V.0.)

Hello?

CINDY

Hello ... Hellooooo ...

(fainter)

Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the

phone and they won't talk.

MAN

If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.

If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.

If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.

That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I

send you home.  Okay?

JACK

That it?

MAN

How many you need?

JACK

It's out of tune.

MAN

Trust me, the way I fix a martini,

it'll be in tune.

SUSIE (O.S.)

I thought the Bakers didn't take

tips.

JACK

I give it all to charity.

SUSIE

Saw the sign outside.  Got your

own sign, huh?

JACK

Yeah.  Got my own sign.

SUSIE

So ... ?

JACK

We outgrew each other.

SUSIE

Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't

figure.  You two.

JACK

You don't pick your brother.

SUSIE

Yeah.

JACK

So how's the cat food business?

SUSIE

Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.

JACK

What kind?

SUSIE

Huh?

JACK

Vegetables.

SUSIE

Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of

the important ones.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new

place.  Or we could go to a bar ...

(looking around)

Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know

a place uptown, if you want --

JACK

I've given it up.

SUSIE

No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a

reunion over tomato juice, can you?

(pause)

Anyway, if you're ever in the

neighborhood ... I wrote it down.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Tell egghead I said hi.  If you

see him.

JACK

If I see him.

JACK

(continuing)

Hey.

(as she stops)

You got pretty eyes.

DONNA

Frank?  It's late, honey.

DONNA

(continuing)

Mrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make

his lesson tomorrow.

FRANK

You know how good he is?  It's like breathing

with him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,

looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.

Maybe it's worse.  For him.

(gesturing to the piano)

It's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.

But when I was up there with him...

It was like I had the gift, too.

FRANK

Come on, Jeremy.  Open the door.

FRANK

(continuing)

Jeremy.  You want me to call your father?

He's not going to be very happy when he hears

he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you

to sit on the toilet.

DONNA

Honey ...

FRANK

You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm

playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next

thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.

There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

DONNA

Honey ...

FRANK

Where are our kids?

Has he got one of them in there?

DONNA

Frank.

JACK

Donna.  Where is she?

DONNA

We tried the apartment, but after

that we didn't know where to call.

DONNA

(continuing)

Frank'll be back in a moment.

He took Little Frank to the bathroom.

DONNA

(continuing)

Jack ...

SUSIE

Jack.

JACK

Hi.

SUSIE

Well, this is some surprise.

(seeing his face)

Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Jack?

SUSIE

(continuing)

You want to come in?

SUSIE

(continuing)

Let me get the light.

JACK

No.

JACK

(continuing)

Leave it dark.

SUSIE

I used to do that.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could

wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on

the other end of it, though.

JACK

I didn't want to wake you.

SUSIE

(smiling slightly)

Yeah.

JACK

Thanks.  For letting me in last night.

SUSIE

Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.

Like a song.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Hey.

SUSIE

(continuing)

Am I gonna see you again?

JACK

Yeah.  You're gonna see me again.

SUSIE

Okay.

JACK

What're you looking for?

FRANK

I didn't hear you come in.

JACK

What're you doing?

FRANK

FRANK

(continuing)

Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd

want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.

If you want to get started.

JACK

Later.

JACK

(continuing)

Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.

FRANK

Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.

She and Dad had taken care of it.

JACK

Right.

FRANK

I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're

doing the stone today.

(pause)

It's okay?  Wednesday?

JACK

Yeah, fine.

FRANK

There's not going to be a viewing.

I figured with the kids and all ...

JACK

Sure.

FRANK

It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the

house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep

up with it. I keep losing my wind.

FRANK

(continuing;glancing away)

God, I could use a drink.

FRANK

(continuing)

Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.

FRANK

(continuing)

Damn.  Donna must've packed

them up this morning.

JACK

Go ahead.

FRANK

No.

JACK

(showing the seal is unbroken)

Bought it on the way over.  Clean

as a nun.

FRANK

No, it's not that.  I ... can't

drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

JACK

Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.

FRANK

(remembering)

Oh, hey, I want to show you

something.  Come on.

FRANK

(continuing)

Hit the C. Go ahead.

FRANK

(continuing)

I'm right, aren't I? They're

in tune.

FRANK

(continuing)

All these years.  She kept them in tune.

Can you imagine?

Now why would she do something like that?

FRANK

(continuing)

Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have

that drink after all.

(picking up a few glasses)

What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.

We got the Travelodge on Route 41.

And ... the Mallory.

JACK

I'll take the Mallory.

FRANK

Good choice.

FRANK

(continuing)

Looks like these got a few years on them.

JACK

This'll kill 'em.

FRANK

Jesus.

JACK

How're your hands?

FRANK

(surprised)

Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple

sore knuckles.  Nothing.

JACK

You know, that night, I ... It

just all came up.

FRANK

Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

JACK

I mean, you can play.  You're

okay.

FRANK

(smiling)

I can keep the beat.

FRANK

(continuing)

Charlie called.

JACK

Yeah?

FRANK

Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.

Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.

Nothing like a little absence to make the heart

grow fonder, huh?

JACK

Yeah.

FRANK

Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?

JACK

Five years ago.

(thinking)

November.

FRANK

Right.  It was someone's birthday.

Halloran?

JACK

Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.

FRANK

Christ, that's right.  How could

I forget.  What a nightmare.

JACK

She asked for it.

FRANK

I told Halloran we didn't do

vocals, but he said:

JACK AND FRANK

(in unison)

What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.

JACK

She got it all right.

JACK AND FRANK

(singing)

She comes on like a dream

Peaches and cream

Lips like strawberry wine

She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.

Ribbons and curls

Ooh, what a girl

Eyes that sparkle and shine

You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

FRANK

Well ... One more time?

JACK

One more time.
