FADE IN:

HARVEY

Put my score up first.

JOHNNIE

They don't want to hear it, Harvey.

HARVEY

I know, but I want to hear it. Put

it up.

JOHNNIE

I'm backed up already, Harvey.

HARVEY

(interrupting)

Johnnie, you were the one that was

late. Just put it up.

JOHNNIE

Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to

present my ideas while your away.

HARVEY

Huh?

2.

JOHNNIE

Look, I'm not doing myself any

favours here, Harvey. But, I'd

watch your back.

HARVEY

Marvin? Hey, Marvin?

MARVIN

Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in

London?

HARVEY

Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's

going on?

MARVIN

Huh?

HARVEY

Johnnie said something about you

wanting him to present on Monday.

MARVIN

Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking

that, what with you being in London

- you should stay a while.

HARVEY

What?

MARVIN

There's no need to rush back. Enjoy

your daughter's wedding.

HARVEY

What?

MARVIN

Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he

can pitch the Samuelson account.

3.

HARVEY

No, I'm coming back. Those are my

connections. They have been for

years.

MARVIN

I know but... they've got new

people running things over there. I

think they're after something...

(beat)

...different.

HARVEY

I want to come back. I should be

there in person.

MARVIN

`There in person'? Harvey, nobody

cares.

HARVEY

I have to stand behind my music!

MARVIN

They're demos! - They're already

pressed. No one needs to be there.

They're not looking for you,

they're not looking for me. They

just need a fucking track.

(beat/sighs)

Harvey, you haven't booked a top

line in 8 months.

HARVEY

You got me doing triangle chimes

for Christ's sake - give me

something to compose!

MARVIN

That's what I'm trying to tell you!

It's not about composition! It's

different now!

MARVIN (CONT'D)

What?

HARVEY

I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm

coming back.

4.

MARVIN

(sighs)

You got to land this one, Harvey.

HARVEY

What are you saying?

(beat)

Say it!

MARVIN

I'm saying there are no more

chances, Harvey.

(beat)

Enjoy London.

CUT TO BLACK.

LAST CHANCE HARVEY

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Shit!

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(to a passing Stewardess)

Miss? I'm sorry. I've spilt my

drink.

STEWARDESS

I'll get you some napkins.

5.

HARVEY

(to his neighbour)

Why's it always me?

STEWARDESS

Shall I take that?

HARVEY

Thanks... And could I get another?

STEWARDESS

A whiskey, wasn't it?

HARVEY

Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

A holiday?

WOMAN

No. Business.

WOMAN (CONT'D)

(feeling obliged)

Yourself?

HARVEY

My daughter's getting married.

WOMAN

Congratulations.

HARVEY

(smiles)

Thank you.

(beat)

She's marrying an American. But for

some reason we've all got to go

over to London.

(smiling)

I told her we had a perfectly good

wedding system here.

(MORE)

6.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(beat/expecting more of a

response)

They both work there, you see.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Thank you.

WOMAN

I'm really sorry but I have a

meeting in the morning and I must

try and get some sleep.

HARVEY

No... Of course. I'm sorry.

WOMAN

It's just, I'll be useless - unless

I get some sleep.

HARVEY

Sure.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

POSTMAN

Morning Kate. Looking lovely as

ever. If I was younger...

7.

KATE

Careful Paddy.

(pointing to her cheek)

Blushing! Is she up?

POSTMAN

Oh yes.

KATE

(calling out)

Mum. It's me - your daughter.

MAGGIE

Hello, my daughter.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

Have a cup of tea with me.

KATE

I can't, I'm running late.

MAGGIE

He's at it again.

KATE

(looking through her bag)

Who? At what?

MAGGIE

The neighbour. Barbecuing or

something.

8.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

I heard he's from Poland.

KATE

(pulling a small package

from her bag)

So maybe Polish people like to

barbecue a lot. I'm leaving your

prescription on the table.

(beat)

You know, you don't have to keep

taking these - the Doctor said.

MAGGIE

I like to. It makes me feel better.

(beat)

Its 8 o'clock in the morning. Who

barbecues at 8?

KATE

(looking at her watch)

I've got to go. I'll call you

later.

MAGGIE

Of course. Don't worry about me.

I'll be Ok.

(beat)

Have you got that date thing

tonight?

KATE

I don't know, maybe.

(kisses her mother)

Bye Mum.

MAGGIE

`Time and tide', Kate, as your

father liked to say.

KATE

Was that from his terrace in the

South of France?

KATE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. That was mean.

(beat/takes a breath)

(MORE)

9.

KATE (CONT'D)

Look, I'll call you later.

(kisses her mum again)

I love you.

KATE

Aggie.

AGGIE

Morning darling.

10.

AGGIE

Four across. A filmy layer on the

surface of a liquid?

KATE

Scum.

OONAGH

Sorry. Sorry.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

Thank God you're my boss.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

Are we still on for tonight? Matt's

definitely bringing Simon.

KATE

No.

OONAGH

Please.

KATE

Only if you guys swear you won't

leave if it's not going well.

OONAGH

No way.

KATE

Promise?

OONAGH

Promise.

AGGIE

Seven down. Another word for

`souvenir'?

11.

KATE

Memento.

OONAGH

Aggie, why do you bother? You just

get Kate to give you all the

answers.

KATE

So you spent the whole 2 weeks in

the Toronto area?

ELDERLY MAN

Yes. Our daughter lives there, see.

KATE

Ah.

(filling in a form)

So not a business trip then?

ELDERLY MAN

Oh, no. Unless you count grand-

children as work.

KATE

(smiles)

Some might.

12.

KATE

Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a

few very quick questions, could I?

HARVEY

I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a

hurry.

KATE

It won't take a moment.

HARVEY

(starting to walk on)

Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you

know?

KATE

Yes. I do.

HARVEY

I'm sorry.

HARVEY

Hi Suzie, it's your Dad. I've made

it in one piece. I'm in a Taxi on

my way to the Hotel. I guess i'll

see you all there. Can't wait. Love

you.

13.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here.

Just wanted to confirm Mike for

Monday. I'm in London at the

moment, but reachable on my cell.

Which is... Well you've probably

got it on file, but just in case,

917... Well you may have to dial an

international code first, I'm not

sure. Anyway, it's 917 749 7558.

That's 917 74...

HARVEY

Hi. I'm with the wedding party.

There should be a room for me.

Harvey Shine.

CONCIERGE

Yes. I have a double room for you.

HARVEY

Good. Has everyone else checked in?

CONCIERGE

I'm not sure, sir.

HARVEY

My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe

she's already going by Wright.

Susan Wright.

CONCIERGE

No, sir. No one of that name.

14.

HARVEY

Do you have a Mrs Pearce?

CONCIERGE

No, sir.

HARVEY

I'll go up.

HARVEY

Hello?

(beat)

Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here.

Where are you - where is everyone?

(listens/Harvey's face

drops a little)

Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I

thought the plan was for everyone

to stay together.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

No its...fine. I just wasn't sure.

(beat)

(MORE)

15.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

So your mother has rented a house

for you all.

(beat)

I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm

a big boy. It's fine.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Home from home.

(beat)

Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll

see you there.

(beat)

I love you too. Bye.

KATE

Mum?

MAGGIE

What are you wearing?

KATE

Dungarees.

MAGGIE

Oh, you're not!

KATE

They're completely in again,

haven't you heard?

16.

MAGGIE

(lifting back the curtain)

Oh, you're just being silly.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

Now don't be nervous. Just be

yourself.

KATE

(smiling)

Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice.

MAGGIE

Oh, listen. I've been thinking

about Greece for our holiday.

KATE

(frowns)

Ok, Let's talk about it later.

(beat)

I love you too.

17.

KATE

Sorry i'm late.

OONAGH

Don't tell me...

(makes the gesture of a

telephone)

...your mother?

KATE

She's worrying about her new

neighbour. Says he barbecues a lot.

OONAGH

Very suspicious.

KATE

(smiles)

I know.

OONAGH

I got you the same as me.

(off Kate's gaze)

They're at the bar. He seems very

nice.

MATT

Hey Kate.

KATE

Hi Matt.

MATT

Kate, this is Simon.

SIMON

Hi.

KATE

Hi.

(beat)

You work with Matt?

SIMON

Yes. If you can call it work.

18.

KATE

(laughs a little too

eagerly)

Right.

OONAGH

Come on, i'm feeling small down

here. Sit!

VOICE (O.S.)

Room service.

HARVEY

Just over by the bed. Thank you.

Hello?

YOUNG AFRICAN MAN

Shall I open this for you?

HARVEY

Careful!

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Are you Ok?

19.

YOUNG AFRICAN MAN

Oh, yes. Yes, fine.

HARVEY

Are you sure? Here.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Hello?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Fuck!

SCOTT

Harvey.

HARVEY

Scott.

SCOTT

You made it.

20.

HARVEY

Yes.

SCOTT

This is Susan's father, Harvey.

Harvey Shine.

(beat)

Harvey, this is my best man, Josh

Stillman and Pete Turner.

HARVEY

Hi.

FRIENDS

Hi.

SCOTT

How are you Harvey?

(glancing at Harvey's

attire)

Its great to see you.

HARVEY

Good thanks. Great.

(sensing his gaze)

How are you holding up?

SCOTT

Great.

(turning to his friends)

Can't wait to marry your daughter,

really.

HARVEY

No...

(beat)

Is she..?

SCOTT

She's through there. She'll be

thrilled you're here. I'll go and

find her.

HARVEY

Sorry.

21.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Yes.

(listens)

No, no, that's not right. I booked

Mike. It's important. I spoke to

him about it two weeks ago. I

booked him.

(getting flustered)

Have you told him its Harvey. It's

really important...

(suddenly conscious of

Scott's friends standing

nearby)

Just...Just get him to call me, Ok?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry.

(beat)

Always something.

JOSH

Sure.

(beat)

What's your field, Harvey?

HARVEY

Oh, I'm a...

(beat)

I work in the music industry.

JOSH

Wow. Doing what?

HARVEY

I'm a composer.

(beat)

Sort of.

PETE

Cool. What kind of stuff?

HARVEY

Oh, you know, for...commercials,

that sort of thing. TV.

(beat)

Mostly background stuff, that sort

of thing.

JOSH

I see.

22.

PETE

Sounds profitable.

HARVEY

It can be.

(wanting to change

subject)

You guys work with Scott?

PETE/JOSH

Yes.

HARVEY

Oil, right?

JOSH

Futures, yes.

HARVEY

Well, I'm sure that's pretty

profitable too.

JOSH

Sometimes, yes.

HARVEY

Well, I'd better find my daughter.

PETE

Absolutely. Good to meet you,

Harvey. See you in there.

OONAGH

So?

KATE

He seems nice.

23.

OONAGH

Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like

dull.

KATE

Nice like how old is he?

OONAGH

Old enough. Your age...ish.

KATE

He can't be, he's looks like a

baby.

OONAGH

Alright, my age. But Matt says he's

very mature.

KATE

Oh right. Did Matt offer that up -

or was that in response to you two

discussing my approaching

barrenness.

OONAGH

Kate?

OONAGH (CONT'D)

Don't answer it.

KATE

I have to. She's on her own.

(beat)

She gets lonely.

OONAGH

Just tell her you're busy.

KATE

Mum?

24.

SUSAN

Hi Dad.

HARVEY

Suz...

(beat)

You look beautiful.

SUSAN

Thank you.

HARVEY

Give us a hug then, as they say in

this country.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

I know, I look ridiculous.

SUSAN

No. You look...

HARVEY

Like a bad lounge act.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

I spilt something on my trousers.

(beat)

I've been doing that a lot

recently.

SUSAN

Dad.

HARVEY

Long way to come to see two

American kids get married.

SUSAN

Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad.

25.

HARVEY

Sorry.

SUSAN

Have you seen mum yet?

HARVEY

No. They're here?

SUSAN

Yes. They're over by our table.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Please Daddy.

HARVEY

What?

(beat)

I'll be good.

SCOTT

Look who i've got!

HARVEY

I'll speak to you later Suz. You

enjoy your friends.

OONAGH

(to Kate)

We've gotta go. Problem at home.

Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing

serious.

(MORE)

26.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

(beat)

But you guys stay.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

(under breath)

Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow.

And turn off that phone.

(beat)

Are you working tomorrow?

KATE

Yes. Half-day.

OONAGH

I'll see you Tuesday.

SIMON

Looks like we've been set up.

KATE

Yes.

(beat)

Sorry.

SIMON

No. It's not your fault. I mean,

I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy

to meet new people.

KATE

Yes, me too.

SIMON

Why don't you sit down?

KATE

Yes.

SIMON

So you're Oonagh's boss?

KATE

Yes.

(beat)

Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot.

27.

SIMON

Yes.

(smiles)

You are.

SIMON (CONT'D)

Do you want another drink?

KATE

Ye...

(smiles)

Sure. I can get them.

SIMON

No, it's fine. What do you fancy?

KATE

I'll have another white wine.

Anything dry.

JEAN

Harvey.

HARVEY

Jean.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Brian.

BRIAN

Harvey. Good to see you.

28.

HARVEY

(deliberately only

directed to Jean)

So our baby girl is really getting

married. Who would've thought?

JEAN

Yes.

BRIAN

Harvey you remember the Watsons.

Barry and Jill.

HARVEY

(slight sarcastic tone)

Of course I do. Hell, its been a

while. I guess, not since Jean and

I split up.

JILL

Hi Harvey. You look well.

HARVEY

Thank you, Jill. You're looking

well too. Both of you. I guess you

guys stayed in touch with Jean.

BRIAN

Barry and I work together now.

HARVEY

No kidding? Insurance?

BARRY

No.

(beat)

Property, now. A small portfolio

down in Florida.

HARVEY

Real Estate. That's great.

(beat)

That's really great.

29.

BRIAN

Well I think we should sit. I know

Susan wanted us all seated before

they joined us.

HARVEY

Sure. Good idea.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry, I have to take this.

(picks up)

Can you hold a minute?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry. Sorry.

KATE

Mum. You've got to stop calling.

(beat)

What? I can't hear. Hold on.

30.

HARVEY

(getting more and more

flustered)

It'll take two hours max. No

longer.

(listens)

Have you told him its Harvey? Look,

we go back! He'll tell you. Just

have him call me.

HARVEY

Sorry...

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(smiling/to Jean)

Did you move me darling?

JEAN

No, Harvey. I didn't touch it.

SUSAN

Dad. I moved you. I thought it

might be easier in case you needed

to get out.

HARVEY

Ok, sweetheart.

BRIAN

Shall we have a quick toast to get

things going?

(beat)

I'm going to save my big speech for

tomorrow.

(laughter)

Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just

want to take us all back to that

wonderful holiday we all had in

Rome together last year and wish

you `Salute'!

EVERYONE

Salute!

31.

BRIAN

Jean and I love you both so much.

And we're so happy that Scott is

going to part of our clan now. And

so I say many, many, happy, happy

years ahead. Salute!

EVERYONE

Salute!

HARVEY

My turn?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry, I thought it was off.

(flustered he finally

manages to stop it

buzzing)

Um, uh.

(beat)

To Susan and Scott. A great couple.

(beat)

Cheers.

EVERYONE

Cheers.

SUSAN

Let's eat.

EVERYONE

Yes...

32.

KATE

Hi.

SIMON

Hey. Kate.

(beat)

Sorry, i bumped into these guys and

couldn't shake them.

(turning to his friends)

Everyone this is Kate.

KATE

Hi.

SIMON

Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen,

and Elinor.

EVERYONE

Hi.

MELISSA

Sorry, I hope we're not barging in

on your evening.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

It was Simon's idea. How do you

guys know each other, anyway?

KATE

We don't really. We just met.

MELISSA

A blind date?

33.

SIMON

No.

(beat)

We met through friends.

MELISSA

I see. I think we should leave you

guys alone.

KATE

(a little too abruptly)

No.

(beat)

Don't. Stay. It's fine.

ANDREW

Hey does anyone know the cricket

score?

SIMON

England were all out by tea, when I

last checked.

ANDREW

Bloody hell.

GWEN

Cricket. Don't get it.

MELISSA

What? Men in white. Oh, I do.

34.

GWEN

I heard that they did it in her

bedroom, while she was away.

SIMON

It was her flat?

GWEN

Yep. He has his own, but was

basically living at hers.

ANDREW

Ouch.

MELISSA

That is evil.

JEAN

Harvey.

HARVEY

Hello Jean.

JEAN

(to barman)

Can I get a glass of water please?

JEAN (CONT'D)

You Ok?

HARVEY

(Downing another drink)

Fine.

35.

JEAN

Go easy Harvey.

HARVEY

(getting quite loaded)

Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm

going to embarrass you again?

JEAN

No Harvey, I'm worried you're going

to embarrass yourself.

(beat)

And more importantly Susan. This

weekend's just about her and Scott.

Nothing else.

HARVEY

Oh, you're good Jean. You're really

good. You've always known how to

make me feel shit, haven't you?

(beat)

You've always been so good at that.

JEAN

I've had cause to practice.

HARVEY

Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud

of me?

JEAN

Yes. Sometimes.

(beat)

But you never listened.

HARVEY

The parties Jean. The fuckin'

parties, where I would hear you -

dressing up what I did for a living

- film composer this, film composer

that - trying to make it more

palatable for your friends. I'm

a...

JEAN

(cutting him off)

Don't Harvey.

36.

HARVEY

What is it you see in Brian?

JEAN

He doesn't talk about himself.

(beat)

He talks about me.

JEAN (CONT'D)

Go home Harvey. Go to bed and see

your daughter get married tomorrow.

SUSAN

Hi Dad.

HARVEY

Hey Suz.

SUSAN

Are you alright?

HARVEY

(upbeat)

Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing?

Enjoying yourself?

SUSAN

Yeah.

HARVEY

He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll

be alright.

SUSAN

Yeah, he is.

(beat)

I'm sorry, I haven't had much time

to talk to you.

HARVEY

No Sweetheart, it's your weekend.

It's no problem. You just enjoy

yourself.

37.

SUSAN

How's work?

HARVEY

Great.

(beat)

Well, not great, but...fine. You

know the usual. Triangle chimes.

SUSAN

Are you still doing your own stuff?

You should.

HARVEY

A bit... Not so much.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Listen Suz, I'm really sorry about

having to leave early. It's just

bad timing. There's a sudden rush

at work, you know, a couple of big

jobs in at once.

SUSAN

Sure.

HARVEY

It just can't be helped. But I'll

be there at the ceremony, at the

really important bit. I'll be there

to give you away.

(beat)

And then I'm sure Brian or your

mother will talk at the reception.

You know me, I've never been very

good at speech...

SUSAN

(interrupting)

Dad.

HARVEY

Yeah, Suz?

SUSAN

Listen, I've been thinking.

(beat)

(MORE)

38.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Brian has been a really big part of

my life now for some time. And...

(long beat)

And I'm going to ask him to give me

away tomorrow.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Dad.

HARVEY

But Suz...

SUSAN

Dad, I've hardly seen you in the

past five years.

HARVEY

That's not true.

SUSAN

Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee

here, or a telephone call there but

no, you haven't been part of my

life. And...

(beat)

And Brian has.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

You having to leave early this

weekend. I don't know, it just

seems typical.

HARVEY

(flash of irritation)

It's work darling. It pays for

things.

(beat/sighs)

Sorry. Look, I...

SUSAN

(interrupting)

I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've

decided.

39.

HARVEY

Sure.

(beat)

I understand, Suz.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

You go and be with your friends. Go

and enjoy yourself.

(pulls out his phone)

I gotta make some stupid calls. You

know. Go and enjoy yourself,

Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow.

HARVEY

You fuckin' asshole!

KATE

Sorry.

40.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

41.

HARVEY

Hello?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Is there another way we could try?

TAXI DRIVER

It's going to be bad everywhere.

Your president's in town. It's

causing chaos.

KATE

Mum?

42.

HARVEY

I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to

JFK.

WAITING PASSENGER

Hey pal, we're all in hurry.

HARVEY

Just hand luggage, can i go

straight to the gate?

STEWARD

Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger,

you'll have to wait.

HARVEY

Please. I've gotta make that

flight.

STEWARD

Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll

just have to wait.

HARVEY

Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can

you check me in?

STEWARD #2

I'm afraid that flight's now

closed.

HARVEY

But it's not yet 4! I just have

hand luggage. It doesn't take off

for another 40 minutes.

STEWARD #2

I'm sorry sir, but we have to close

the gate 45 minutes prior to

departure.

HARVEY

But I just have hand luggage.

Please. I've got to get on that

flight.

STEWARD #2

I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I

can do.

43.

HARVEY

When's the next flight?

STEWARD #2

There's one at 8.30. But I     know

that's full. I can put you     on stand-

by, but I doubt you'll get     on.

(beat)

The earliest I can get you     on for

sure, is tomorrow morning,     10.30.

HARVEY

(shouts)

Jesus!

STEWARD #2

Sir, I'm sorry, but you have to

stay calm.

HARVEY

Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen,

there's been a mess up, the traffic

was crazy. I'm going to have to

reschedule the pitch slightly.

Frank can set up. I'll email him

the cue numbers - he knows what to

do. And then I'll be there lunch-

time at the latest. I'll come

straight from the airport. I'll try

you again shortly.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Hello?

MARVIN

I got your message.

44.

HARVEY

The traffic was insane. But

listen...

MARVIN

(interrupting)

The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!

MARVIN (CONT'D)

Listen, Harvey. Stay in London.

Enjoy your daughter's wedding.

We'll talk when you get back.

HARVEY

It's fine, I'll be there lunch-

time. It's no problem. Steve knows

what I need. Mike's coming in. It's

all set u...

MARVIN

(interrupting)

Harvey!

MARVIN (CONT'D)

It's over.

(beat/sighs)

It's out of my hands Harvey. I have

people to answer to. We just can't

afford the space.

(beat)

We're letting you go.

HARVEY

Letting me go? Can't afford the

space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch-

time.

MARVIN

I'm sorry Harvey.

(beat/sighs)

Call me when you get back.

45.

HARVEY

Jamesons, no ice.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Another.

(beat)

Please.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Another, please.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

What?

BAR MAN

Sorry.

HARVEY

Shit!

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry. Vulgar American.

46.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(to himself)

I know, we don't raise our voices

in this country. It's not done.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(to Kate)

I'm sorry.

KATE

For what?

HARVEY

For yesterday. I was rude. You

tried to ask me some questions.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

You were just trying to do your job

and I was rude.

KATE

I don't really remember, but I'm

sure you were. Most people are.

HARVEY

Good book?

KATE

It probably would be, if i could

finish it.

HARVEY

(holds up his hands)

I get it.

KATE

That'll help.

47.

HARVEY

(looks over)

Sorry?

KATE

I said, that'll help.

HARVEY

Believe me, it will.

KATE

Right.

HARVEY

I reckon it'll help as much as that

trashy novel and a glass of

chardonnay.

KATE

O-kay.

HARVEY

I'm really sorry. That was out of

line.

KATE

(looks up)

What? Go away and stop apologizing.

HARVEY

It's just that i've had a really

shitty day.

KATE

(looking back at her book)

Join the club.

HARVEY

No. I mean really shitty. Yours may

have been shitty, but mine was

shittier.

48.

KATE

How shitty?

HARVEY

I missed my flight. I lost my job.

And my daughter who got married in

London today asked her step father

rather than me to give her away.

KATE

Not bad.

(beat)

But what can I do for you?

(beat)

Make it worse, maybe?

HARVEY

Let me make it up to you.

(beat)

Would you let me buy you lunch.

What time is it - tea time? I'll

buy you tea.

KATE

That's very sweet of you, but... I

don't know you. And... you don't

know me.

HARVEY

Exactly. That's why we should have

lunch - tea.

KATE

Thank you, but...no.

HARVEY

Because you've got your book. And

it's a good replacement for humans.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

If that's for me I'm in the shower.

49.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Aren't you going to answer that?

KATE

No.

HARVEY

Should I take that as a hopeful

sign.

KATE

If it is, you could just give me a

little wider smile.

HARVEY

Look we are having lunch together.

KATE

(looks up and smiles)

No. We're having lunch next to each

other.

50.

HARVEY

Ah.

(beat/suddenly holds out

his hand)

I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.

KATE

(takes it)

Kate. Kate Walker.

KATE (CONT'D)

So why aren't you at the wedding?

HARVEY

Ah, that's better. I knew something

was missing.

(shouting over the din)

I had to get back for a work thing.

KATE

(over the din)

A work thing. For the job you just

lost?

HARVEY

(over din)

Yes.

KATE

(over din)

I see.

(beat)

So, this job you lost. You liked

it?

HARVEY

(over din)

Yes.

(beat)

No. Not really. They've beaten it

out of me. But its what i do - did.

51.

KATE

(over din)

Which is - was?

HARVEY

(shouts)

I'm a composer.

(stops himself)

I write jingles.

KATE

Wow.

HARVEY

That's about the normal response.

KATE

Anything I would of heard?

HARVEY

Yes. Uh...Uh...

(long beat)

Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before

your time.

KATE

(smiles)

No, go on.

HARVEY

(singsong voice)

You can take the Salem out of the

country - but you can't take the

country out of Salem.

KATE

No.

HARVEY

It's a cigarette.

KATE

Oh really?

HARVEY

Forget it.

52.

KATE

Ok.

KATE (CONT'D)

(over din)

Did you always want to write

jingles or was there something

more?

KATE (CONT'D)

What?

HARVEY

No, I just love the way you...you

just cut through it.

KATE

I'll take that as a compliment.

HARVEY

You should.

(beat)

I was going to be a Jazz pianist.

KATE

Were you good?

HARVEY

No. Not enough.

KATE

I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend

to blurt stuff out.

HARVEY

No. I like it. I like it...

(beat/over din)

...Alot.

53.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

It's a relief to find someone in

this country who actually says what

they feel.

KATE

Oh, haven't you heard?

HARVEY

What?

KATE

That's all changed. We're a nation

changed. Ever since Diana, we've

unlocked ourselves. Everything's

flowing out.

(beat)

You guys showed us the way.

HARVEY

Just as we're trying to adopt your

stiff upper lip.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

What is a stiff upper lip, exactly?

KATE

No, I think, it's more this.

HARVEY

I see.

(copies her)

How's that?

KATE

(top lip stretched)

Yeah you're getting there. Stretch

it out further.

HARVEY

Let me see again.

KATE

No, now you're doing a bulldog.

HARVEY

Like this?

54.

KATE

No, now you look like you don't

have any teeth.

(beat)

Are they your own?

HARVEY

What?

KATE

Your teeth?

HARVEY

The front ones.

KATE

My dad had a front one that you

could just take out.

HARVEY

Really?

KATE

Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.

HARVEY

Yes. So did I.

KATE

I should get going. I have a class.

HARVEY

A class?

KATE

(a bit sheepish)

Yes. A...writing class.

(beat)

Twice a week. Just something I do.

(changing the subject)

(MORE)

55.

KATE (CONT'D)

I take the Heathrow Express. What

about you?

HARVEY

I don't know. I guess I'll stay in

a Hotel near here. My flight's in

the morning.

KATE

Well...it's been a

pleasure...Harvey Shine.

HARVEY

Yes. Yes it has.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

There's your phone again.

KATE

Yes.

(beat)

Sorry. I'd better go.

HARVEY

I'd like a room please.

(beat)

One night.

56.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Sorry. Excuse me.

HARVEY

Sorry.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry.

(turning to Kate)

Hi.

(a little sheepish)

I thought i might as well stay in

town. More fun than a hotel next to

a runway, right?

57.

KATE

Taxi's are over there. They'll take

you to wherever you need to go.

KATE (CONT'D)

So, I guess it's goodbye again.

HARVEY

Yes.

(looks up at the evening

sky/beat)

So, I couldn't walk you to your

class, could I?

(beat)

Carry your books?

(beat)

Stand near the curb so you don't

get splashed.

KATE

Sure.

HARVEY

Is that a yes?

KATE

Yes.

(beat)

Why not?

58.

HARVEY

Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

What?

KATE

Its just a funny way of saying it.

Quite old fashioned.

HARVEY

Really?

KATE

But i like it.

(beat)

Yours is glorious country,

Honeychurch.

KATE (CONT'D)

It's a line from a book. `Room with

a View'.

HARVEY

I'm afraid I'm not much of a

reader.

(beat)

Too fidgety, I guess.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

You think less of me.

KATE

No, we're just quite different,

that's all.

HARVEY

Is that bad?

59.

KATE

(thinks about it)

No.

HARVEY

Both our phones ring a lot. We have

that in common.

KATE

(smiles)

Ah.

KATE (CONT'D)

Sorry. I should probably take this.

KATE (CONT'D)

Mum?

(beat)

I've been busy.

(beat)

No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No

someone else.

(beat)

Yes.

(looks at Harvey)

...a man.

KATE (CONT'D)

You did, did you?

(beat)

An actual body.

KATE (CONT'D)

Mum. Listen. I'll come over

tomorrow and we can check it out

together.

(beat)

I have to go now. Just get an early

night and i'll see you tomorrow.

(beat)

I love you too.

60.

KATE (CONT'D)

Sorry.

(beat)

My mother.

HARVEY

She worries about you?

KATE

And herself.

(beat)

She's convinced she's living next

to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.

HARVEY

I see.

KATE

She means well. She's just had a

tough run.

(long beat)

My Father ran off to France with

his secretary. Then mum got cancer,

about four years ago now. She's

fully recovered. But won't admit

it.

(beat)

She's basically bored. And my

continued `situation' as she calls

it, being single, is her major

distraction. Her pastime if you

will.

HARVEY

I see.

KATE

Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison

d'etre.

(grimaces/turns to Harvey)

Sorry.

HARVEY

No.

KATE

I talk too much.

61.

HARVEY

No. I like it.

KATE

Do you?

HARVEY

Yes.

KATE

Hmm.

(beat)

Well, here we are. My class.

HARVEY

How long is the class?

KATE

An hour.

HARVEY

Can I wait?

(beat)

Sorry - I promise I'm not

`Bundyish'.

KATE

(smiles)

It's getting cold. You don't want

to wait.

HARVEY

Yes I do.

KATE

(smiling and backing

towards the building)

Careful, I might get the wrong

impression.

HARVEY

What can you do?

62.

HARVEY

How did it go?

KATE

Oh, the usual.

(beat)

Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us

the latest installment from his

Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all

tried to look at him in the same

way after.

KATE (CONT'D)

Shall we keep walking?

HARVEY

Yes.

63.

KATE

Do you ever wish you could try a

different life?

(beat)

Just for a day. Just to see what it

would be like.

HARVEY

What would yours be?

KATE

(looks down at her

uniform)

Well, no green, that's for sure.

KATE (CONT'D)

(beat/thinks)

It would take place in Spain. A

little house inland.

HARVEY

And what would you do there?

KATE

Oh...I don't know...

(beat)

Write the great novel.

(beat)

I think I've got one inside me.

We're not talking high art. Just a

bloody good holiday read.

HARVEY

Ok. So this house in Spain would

have a little cabana looking out

over the plains for you to write

in.

KATE

(smiling)

Yes.

64.

HARVEY

And a little stream running by, to

bathe in.

KATE

(smiling)

Sure.

HARVEY

I'm there.

(beat)

Sorry, that's if you're receiving

guests.

KATE

Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.

HARVEY

Why, thank you Kate Walker.

KATE

What happened Harvey?

(beat)

Between you and your daughter?

HARVEY

I don't know.

(beat)

Somewhere along the way I lost her.

I lost my family.

(beat)

I just woke up one morning and

realised i didn't belong.

65.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

I'd always had this mean little

feeling in my stomach, that they

were a bit embarrassed by me.

(beat)

If you saw them now, with Brian,

Susan's step-father. You'd see,

they make more sense. They look

right together.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

I've not been a great father.

KATE

The reception. It's still going on?

HARVEY

(looks at his watch)

I guess.

KATE

Where?

HARVEY

The Grovesnor. Why?

KATE

You must go.

HARVEY

What?

KATE

What the hell are you doing here?

You must go!

HARVEY

She doesn't need me.

66.

KATE

Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

She's your daughter, you're her

father. Go!

KATE (CONT'D)

Harvey, it would be unforgivable

not to go.

KATE (CONT'D)

Harvey?

HARVEY

Wait. I'm thinking.

(beat)

Only if you come with me.

KATE

What?

HARVEY

Please, come with me. As

my...bodyguard.

(smiles)

As my friend.

KATE

Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to

go to anyone's wedding in a green

polyester work suit. Secondly it's

not right.

HARVEY

We'll find you a dress. If we find

you a dress, will you come?

KATE

No.

HARVEY

Please.

KATE

No.

HARVEY

Please.

67.

KATE

No.

KATE

Come on.

68.

HARVEY

Hey.

SUSAN

Hi.

HARVEY

I didn't go.

SUSAN

I'm glad.

HARVEY

This is Kate. A... friend.

KATE

(sheepish)

Hi. Congratulations. You look

fantastic.

SUSAN

Thank you.

KATE

I'm really sorry to gate-crash.

Your father sort of insisted.

SUSAN

No, it's fine. I'm sure...

(looks around)

...there's room.

HARVEY

You get back. Don't worry about us,

we'll find a place.

KATE

Yes...

SUSAN

No.

(stops a passing waiter)

Could you find them a seat please.

WAITER

Sure.

69.

SUSAN

I'd better go.

PETE (MC)

And now for the best man's speech.

Except we seem to be missing the

bride.

(laughter)

Oh, no, here she is.

JOSH

Scott. What can I say...

WAITER

I'm afraid this is the only place

left.

HARVEY

That's fine.

KATE

Hi.

GIRL

Are you Uncle Harvey?

HARVEY

Yes. I guess.

GIRL

I've heard about you.

70.

HARVEY

Oh.

(beat)

You're not Miriam's kid are you?

GIRL

Yes.

HARVEY

Wow...You've...got big. I mean

grown up.

GIRL

I'm fourteen.

HARVEY

Wow.

KATE

Hello.

KATE (CONT'D)

Now you're not to dominate the

conversation tonight.

(turning back to Harvey)

Chatterbox to my left.

JOSH

So without further ado, I'd like to

propose a toast to Susan for making

my friend Scott complete.

PETE (MC)

And now ladies and Gentlemen. It is

the turn of the Father of the Bride

to say a few words.

(MORE)

71.

PETE (MC) (CONT'D)

And tonight that task will be

carried out by the very charming

and distinguished Brian.

BRIAN

Well, that's quite some speech

Josh. Quite something to follow.

But I shall try...

HARVEY

Um... Excuse me...

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

But you see I can't just sit hear

and watch somebody else give my

baby girl away. Susan's my daughter

and I'm her father. Not the best,

by far, but her father all the

same.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Thanks.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Um... I should have prepared

something but... I guess it reminds

me of a joke...

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Sorry. Um...

72.

JEAN

For God's sake Harvey, don't make a

scene.

HARVEY

No Jean. I want to make a scene.

You know. I'm tired of being

embarrassed.

(beat)

If we can't make a scene on the day

of our daughter's wedding, then

when can we? I want to make a

scene. I want to shout! I wanna

tell the world how lucky it is to

have our Suzie in it!

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD

Yeah!

HARVEY

I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky

he is!

UNCLE FRED

Hear, hear!

HARVEY

(smiling)

And also if he ever hurts her, I

know people in north of London.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Seriously though. Scott, I swear

you have found in Susan a bright

and passionate person. And a loyal

friend.

CONGREGATION

Hear, hear!

HARVEY

And I can see from the way she

looks at you. From the way she is

with you, that she is...

(beat)

(MORE)

73.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

...happy.

(beat)

And I thank you and welcome you to

the family.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

And finally, if I can linger a

moment longer. I would like to turn

it back over to Brian, with a note

of... gratitude.

(beat)

Thank you for being there for my

baby girl. Thank you for being

there, when I wasn't.

BRIAN

If you would all please join Harvey

and I, in a toast.

(beat)

To Susan and Scott.

CONGREGATION

Susan and Scott!

KATE

Well done.

HARVEY

Really?

PETE (MC)

Ladies and Gentlemen, the first

dance.

74.

SUSAN

Thanks for coming back Dad.

HARVEY

Thanks for having me back.

75.

KATE

Wow.

KATE (CONT'D)

One of yours?

76.

HARVEY

You are very kind. But...no.

(beat)

Shearing doing Rogers.

KATE

Ah.

(beat)

Well...you play it very well.

HARVEY

(bows his head a

little/with a smile)

Well, thank you Ms. Walker.

KATE

You're most welcome, Mr Shine.

HARVEY

Me thinks you were leaving?

KATE

Indeed I was, Sire.

HARVEY

Why?

KATE

Because you looked happy.

KATE (CONT'D)

You should be with your family,

Harvey.

HARVEY

But, you know, maybe I want to be

with you.

(beat/sings)

You make me happy - when skies are

grey.

KATE

Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing.

77.

HARVEY

Thank you.

KATE

For what?

HARVEY

For making me come here.

KATE

You're welcome.

HARVEY

Can I?

KATE

What?

HARVEY

Can I...?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Hey kid, they're playing our song.

KATE

Yes.

HARVEY

(excited)

Come on. I want you to meet people.

I want them to meet you.

78.

PETE (MC)

Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and

groom are about to leave. Please

join me outside to send them off in

style.

SUSAN

Bye Dad.

HARVEY

Bye Suz... Bye Susan.

SUSAN

Be gentle with him.

HARVEY

(to Kate)

Sorry.

79.

KATE

You Ok?

HARVEY

Yes. Yes, I am.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

You wanna get out of here?

KATE

Sure.

KATE

I don't think I've stayed up all

night since I was a student.

HARVEY

You got sad. Why?

KATE

Oh, I don't know. My uniform's

green?

80.

KATE (CONT'D)

I was pregnant once.

(beat)

I didn't have it. Didn't give it a

moment's thought.

(beat)

That's what smart girls did.

KATE (CONT'D)

I do sometimes wonder what they'd

be like today.

(beat)

Whether they'd be smart. Funny.

Serious.

(beat)

I don't know, it's silly.

KATE (CONT'D)

I don't know why i just told you

that.

HARVEY

No.

(beat)

I'm glad.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Meet me here, tomorrow.

KATE

What?

HARVEY

Exactly here, at these chairs. At

noon.

KATE

What about your flight, Harvey?

HARVEY

I don't want to leave.

(beat)

Guess why.

81.

KATE

Why?

HARVEY

I wanna be with you.

KATE

Shut up, Harvey.

HARVEY

It's true.

KATE

You say that now, but wait until

tomorrow.

HARVEY

Today is tomorrow.

KATE

Harvey we know nothing about each

other. You're...

HARVEY

Old?

KATE

A bit older, yes.

(beat)

I can be mean. Really mean.

HARVEY

So can I.

KATE

No. Truly cantankerous.

HARVEY

So can I.

KATE

(standing)

I should be going.

82.

HARVEY

I know enough to know, I'll be

here. Waiting, at this chair.

KATE

Sure, Harvey.

HARVEY

Noon. I mean it.

(beat)

I'll be here.

KATE

Ok.

HARVEY

Wait.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

(pulling away/can't help

smiling)

Sorry.

KATE

Harvey Shine.

HARVEY

Can I have something until

tomorrow.

KATE

(stepping backwards)

I must go.

83.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

HARVEY

Morning.

CONCIERGE

I'm afraid they're both out of

order, Sir.

HARVEY

I guess i'll walk, then.

HARVEY

Shit.

84.

PORTER

Sir, are you Ok?

HARVEY

I've got to go. I've got to be

somewhere.

DOCTOR

Sir, I need you to stay calm. It

looks to me like Arrhythmia - an

irregular heart-beat.

HARVEY

Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been

trying to tell the nurse. I've had

it since I was a kid. I take

Primax. I guess i've been

forgetting to take it recently.

I've been under alot of stress,

that's all.

85.

DOCTOR

Well Ok, then we probably know

where we're at. But I need to check

all possibilities.

HARVEY

I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I

have to be there.

DOCTOR

Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job

is to make sure it's not that 1%. I

wouldn't be doing my job if I

didn't check out absolutely

everything.

(beat)

Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by

Bloods. And can you arranfe a

monitored bed for him for tonight.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

86.

KATE

(calling out)

Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.

MAGGIE

Why don't you stay and have some

lunch?

KATE

I can't, I've got to go.

(beat)

Not to pry or anything but why is

there a large smoked ham under the

stairs?

MAGGIE

Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The

neighbour gave it to me.

KATE

The polish neighbour?

(beat)

So probably not a mass murderer.

MAGGIE

Probably not.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

Are you sure you're going to be

alright?

KATE

Of course I will. I'll be fine.

MAGGIE

Men, who needs them. Remember we've

got Greece to look forward to.

KATE

Yeah.

87.

PADDY

Morning Kate.

KATE

Morning Paddy.

PADDY

Looking lovely as ever.

KATE

(resigned)

Thank you.

HARVEY

It's some sort of Statistics

Agency.

(listens)

Yes. That sounds right. Yes, based

out at Heathrow.

(listens)

Thank you. Hold on.

(turns to a receptionist)

Miss, could I borrow, your pen.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Thanks, thanks alot.

OONAGH

O.N.S., Heathrow branch.

(beat)

Hold on.

(MORE)

88.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

(calling out)

Kate it's for you. Some guy called

Harvey.

OONAGH (CONT'D)

Um, I'm sorry. She's not here.

HARVEY

Please. It's important.

OONAGH

Hold on.

OONAGH

I'm sorry, she's busy.

(beat)

She won't come.

RECEPTIONIST

If I could just get you to sign

these, you'll be all done.

89.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

And there.

(beat)

And that's it.

HARVEY

Hello?

MARVIN

Hey Harvey, it's Marvin. Where are

you?

HARVEY

(turns from the counter)

Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.

MARVIN

Well you get yourself back here my

friend. I've got some great news.

You were right. The Samuelson

account. None of the kids could

handle it. They couldn't nail it.

They ended up picking one of your

old tunes. They want you to come

back and update it.

(beat)

We need you back, Harvey. Your old

room's here waiting for you.

(beat)

Harvey?

HARVEY

Well, that's great Marvin.

MARVIN

Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean,

look, I know when to eat humble

pie. So look, hey, when can you get

back here?

(beat)

Harvey?

90.

HARVEY

I...I'm not coming back.

MARVIN

What?

HARVEY

I'm quitting Marvin.

MARVIN

What you mean you quit? Harvey,

fuck you man, you need us.

HARVEY

No, you know, I don't. As you said,

it's my `last chance'.

(beat)

Look, I gotta go.

HARVEY

(calling out)

Taxi!

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Heathrow please. As quick as you

can.

91.

HARVEY

Excuse me, I'm looking for a Kate.

Kate Walker.

AGGIE

Who wants to know?

HARVEY

A friend.

(beat)

More than a friend.

AGGIE

There's a man here looking for

Kate, says he's `more than a

friend.'

OONAGH (O.S.)

More than a friend?!

OONAGH (CONT'D)

You're the American.

(long beat)

She likes you. I can tell.

(beat)

Now, don't you go messing her

around. Don't you hurt her.

HARVEY

I wouldn't. I won't.

OONAGH

She's not here.

HARVEY

Oh.

OONAGH

She's left for the day.

(beat)

But you might find her at her

class.

(looks at her watch)

I think it starts around now. Down

on the Southbank. At the National.

92.

HARVEY

Yes, I know.

OONAGH

Oh you do, do you?

(beat)

Well, go on. Go get her.

HARVEY

Thank you.

MIKE

The blood oozes from his wound like

dark chocolate on a warm summer's

day.

KATE

Hey.

HARVEY

Hey.

93.

KATE

You're still here - still in

London...

HARVEY

Yeah.

(beat)

Kate, I just wanted to apologise

and explain...

KATE

No, you don't have to - explain -

it's fine -

HARVEY

No, but I do -

KATE

I don't need to hear - it's fine,

seriously.

HARVEY

But I want to...

(comes out)

I had to go to Hospital.

KATE

Oh, God! Why?!

HARVEY

No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just

forgot to take my pills. I have

this condition, I've had it since I

was a kid - it's an irregular heart-

beat sort of thing.

KATE

Arrythmia.

HARVEY

Yes! How do you know what it is?

KATE

(smiling a little

sheepish)

My...My father has it.

HARVEY

(smiling)

Well, young men get it too.

94.

HARVEY (CONT'D (CONT'D)

Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

KATE

Harvey, I like you, I really do.

And I had a lovely time - it was

great. But, you know, I don't

really do fountains at noon.

(beat)

I live in Willesden. And you live -

in -

HARVEY

White Plains.

KATE

Exactly. And we're not teenagers,

so - you know, monday morning and

life kicks in, all that jobs and

family and brown envelopes with

bills in - it was a lovely day and

I won't forget it, but it's not

exactly real life...

HARVEY

It is. It can be.

KATE

No, Harvey, it's not.

HARVEY

Kate, I want this. I want you.

KATE

But it's not just about you, is it?

(beat)

You don't know anything about me.

Look at me. It's pathetic. I

expected you not to show for God's

sake. I think I even wanted you not

to be there, it's easier that way.

(beat)

You - you just dive in wherever,

deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your

bloody swimming pool Harvey.

(starting to break)

(MORE)

95.

KATE (CONT'D)

And I am not going to do it, I'm

not going to do it because it will

hurt. Not right now, maybe, but

soon - there will be a "it's not

quite working is it" or a "I need

some space" or whatever it is and

it'll end and it'll hurt and I

won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh

fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't

want this...

KATE (CONT'D)

I think it's actually easier for me

to be disappointed. I think I'm

actually angry at you for trying to

take that away.

KATE (CONT'D)

(firmly)

Mum, I love you, but not now.

HARVEY

Should I take that as a hopeful

sign?

HARVEY (CONT'D)

If you just give me a little wider

smile.

KATE

(smiling/laughing)

Oh, shut up, Harvey.

KATE (CONT'D)

So how's this going to work, Mr

Shine?

96.

HARVEY

I have absolutely no idea...

(beat)

But it will.

(beat)

I promise you that.

KATE

Shall we walk?

HARVEY

Yes.

KATE

That's better.

HARVEY

I think you're my kinda girl.

HARVEY (CONT'D)

Why don't you ask me those

questions?

KATE

Which ones?

HARVEY

You know, from the airport. When I

wouldn't stop.

KATE

Oh, the questionnaire.

(beat)

Ok. Name?

HARVEY

Harvey Shine.

97.

KATE

Place of residence?

HARVEY

I'm in transition.

THE END
