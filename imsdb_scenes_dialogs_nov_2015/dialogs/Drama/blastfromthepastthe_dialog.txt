BLAST FROM THE PAST - by Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson

HELEN

For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got

guests!

CALVIN

Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling

with this darn rheostat.

HELEN

Well, put it down and come in!

CALVIN

You bet, hon!

NAVY PILOT (ON

RADIO)

Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the

overhead.

TOWER (ON RADIO)

Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.

You're number one for the overhead.

NAVY PILOT (ON

RADIO)

Wolf one.

PILOT

Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem

here.

TOWER (OC)

Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you

declaring an emergency?

PILOT

Stand by. One.

BETTY

Just remember: don't mention the

communists!

DAVE

Calvin's a great guy, but he's a

little, you know...

BETTY

Nutty.

RUTH

What's his wife like?

BETTY

Oh, you know, housewife.

DAVE

Likes to cook. Pregnant.

RUTH

Normal, then.

BETTY

Well, I wouldn't go that far.

(then)

Helen!

HELEN

Hi, Betty!  Dave!

BETTY

Just look at you!

HELEN

Any day now!

BETTY

This is my sister and her husband.

HELEN

Oh, hi! Welcome!

CALVIN

So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,

"I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And

the clerk says, "Will that be cash or

a check?"  And the duck says, "Just

put it on my bill!"

DAVE

He was the golden-boy professor at Cal

Tech.  But then he starts inventing

things.

BOB

What kind of things?

DAVE

You got me.  Some kind of special

synthetic rubber.  And some kind of

automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly

he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits

teaching.

CALVIN

How's that?

GUEST

Just what the doctor ordered!

BETTY

With all his money they could have

moved to Beverly Hills, but they

decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin

spends all his time tinkering out

there in his workshop.  If you ask me

it's all very strange.

WOMAN GUEST #1

(chiming in)

He dug a huge hole out there for a

swimming pool. Then he decided he

didn't want it and filled the thing

in. And what's that big, high fence

for?

CALVIN

There currently exists a type of neon

light that lasts five years.  But you

won't see it on the market. Same is

true of batteries. I could take your

simple yacht battery and rig it to

last a decade, easily.

HAROLD

Well, what the heck kind of a

marketing system can't get great new

products like that out to the public?

CALVIN

(intense)

A veeeery good one, Harold. Free

market capitalism may not be a perfect

order, but it's the best we've got, or

will ever have.  And why?  Three

reasons!

WOMAN GUEST #2

Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think

about this trouble down in Cuba?

HELEN

(rolling her eyes)

Oh, please don't bring that up!

CALVIN

I'd say my baseball card collection is

as complete as any one I've ever seen.

RON

Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!

(pointing over his shoulder)

Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with

Khrushchev on the television!

JFK

...this sudden, clandestine decision

to station strategic weapons for the

first time outside of Soviet soil, is

a deliberately provocative and

unjustified change in the status quo

which cannot be accepted by this

country.

TOWER

Wolf One -- say intentions.

PILOT

I've got secondaries of an engine fire

and I'll need to find a clear area to

eject.

TOWER

Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to

the ocean?

JFK

...we will not prematurely or

unnecessarily risk the cost of

worldwide nuclear war, in which even

the fruits of victory would be ashes

in our mouth.  But neither will we

shrink from the risk at any time it

must be faced.

CALVIN

I'm sorry everyone, but given this

extraordinary turn of events, I think

it's prudent that we cut the evening

short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will

resolve itself, but in the

meantime...I'd suggest taking a

prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

HELEN

We'll do this again! Maybe next week.

Here's your hat. Could I wrap

something up for you? Did you have a

coat?

DAVE

(sotto to Bob)

What'd I tell ya?!

CALVIN

It's time.

HELEN

(misinterpreting, holding her

stomach)

Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time

yet. I still have--

HELEN (cont'd)

Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm

not sure I'm really ready for this.

CALVIN

On the contrary, I think we're the

only ones who are.

HELEN (OC)

Calvin I'm sure everything's going to

be all right. I just know it is!

HELEN

Well, I'm certainly not going to let

the pot roast go to waste. Could you

just put that seat cover back on that

lawn chair?

HELEN (cont'd)

Shouldn't we at least turn off the

phonograph?

CALVIN

It shuts off automatically.

HELEN

Did you rig it to do that? You're so

clever.

CALVIN

No.  They all do.

HELEN

I never know anymore.

CALVIN

I bet that's a fighter jet on his way

to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

TOWER

An emergency has been declared. I

repeat, an emergency has been

declared.

CALVIN

You hear that?!

HELEN

Yes.

CALVIN

We can listen to the rest downstairs!

HELEN

Calvin, I wish you would have at least

let me do the dishes. It's not going

to be that easy getting all that dried-

on food off my nice plates.

CALVIN

I just hope those plates aren't

radioactive by tomorrow morning.

HELEN

Cheese is particularly troublesome.

CALVIN

Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

HELEN

Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that

Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember

that?

CALVIN

Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast

and watch your step.  I'll come back

for the radio.

PILOT

Tower, say again!!

TOWER

The SAR HELO is airborne with you in

sight.

PILOT

I'm marking the 180 radial for five

and ejecting.

TOWER

Roger, Wolf One.

HELEN

How long will we have to stay down

here?

CALVIN

I don't know. For this thing to blow

over, it could take days.

HELEN

Days??

CALVIN

Rather safe than sorry. That's my

motto!

HELEN

But, what if I go into labor? That

could happen any time.

CALVIN

I've read up on it. I'll deliver the

baby myself if I have to.

HELEN

Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,

when this baby comes, you're going to

be out in the waiting

room smoking yourself to death with

all the other fathers.

CALVIN

(chuckling)

Yes, dear!

HELEN

As long as we've got that straight.

CALVIN

(with arms spread)

Home sweet home!

HELEN

To you maybe.

HELEN

What was that?!

CALVIN

Are you all right?!

HELEN

Yes, I think so.

CALVIN

Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that

heat!!  All my surface indicators are

knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's

actually happened!!

HELEN

What's that noise?

CALVIN

The locks.

HELEN

The locks?

CALVIN

To keep us from trying to leave. After

an atomic blast there's a radiation

half-life that lasts thirty five

years.

HELEN

Thirty -five years!

CALVIN

Then after that it's safe.

HELEN

It's safe.

CALVIN

To go up.

HELEN

To go up.

CALVIN

(confidently)

Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're

going to be just fine.

LEVY

According to Caltech, this Webber guy

was a bonafide genius and a borderline

nutcase.

ATKINSON

Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have

been out here when the plane hit.

LEVY

Unless we get a postcard or somethin',

that's my guess.

ATKINSON

What about relatives?

LEVY

All back East.

ATKINSON

The neighbors over there said the guy

spent day and night out here. She'd

bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.

Pepper.

LEVY

He drank it hot?

ATKINSON

Yeah.

LEVY

Good god.

ATKINSON

Yeah.

CALVIN

Hi, honey! Feeling better?

HELEN

No.

CALVIN

We have to be strong, sweetheart. If

not for ourselves, for the child.

HELEN

All our friends...

CALVIN

Burnt to a crisp.

(indicating sandwiches)

I've given you the most well-done cut.

HELEN

I'm not hungry.

CALVIN

Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

HELEN

(leaving)

No, Calvin, you're favorite.

CALVIN

Really?

CALVIN

A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.

Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.

HELEN

Maybe I've just got the creeps.

CALVIN

How could you?! This is just like

home!

HELEN

No. No! Calvin, this is different!

Believe me!

CALVIN

Would you like a tranquilizer?

HELEN

You have tranquilizers?

CALVIN

I told you! I've got everything!

Helen groans in pain.

HELEN

Oh, no.

CALVIN

What?

HELEN

Uh, oh. Now it's time.

CALVIN

Honey?

CALVIN (OC)

The first child to be born on earth

after the annihilation!!

CALVIN

Is there a problem?

HELEN

No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

CALVIN

I've noticed.

HELEN

What shall we call him?

HELEN (cont'd)

Well, I was thinking...in light of the

situation...that we should call him

Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

CALVIN

No.  I think it's just right.

HELEN

And I was wondering...if...if I could

have a...

CALVIN

Yes!

HELEN

If I...you know...

CALVIN

What? Whatever you want, Helen!

HELEN

I want a bedroom ceiling.

CALVIN

You've got it!

HELEN (OC)

Calvin?!

CALVIN

Right here!

HELEN

(arriving)

We looked all over for you. What are

you doing back here?

CALVIN

Oh, I was just examining this rear

hatchway.

HELEN

Why?

CALVIN

No reason.

(then, off her look)

Well, it's pretty clear that the front

entrance caved in when the bomb went

off. So, you know, when the time is

up, we'll have to return to the

surface using, you know, this back

entrance.  Which is very nice because

it has the service elevator!

HELEN

Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

CALVIN

Yes.  Well... yes.

CALVIN (cont'd)

You wanted to see me?

HELEN

Watch this!

CALVIN

What?

HELEN

Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.

WORKMAN #1

Hey, Boss!

WORKMAN #1

What do you make of this?

BOSS

Damn if I know.

WORKMAN #2

I bet it's some kinda septic tank.

WORKMAN #1

I've never seen a septic tank that

looked like that.

BOSS

Well, don't fool with it. If it is a

septic tank, I sure as hell don't want

to open it. We'll just lay the

foundation over it.

WORKMAN #1

Okay.

REALTOR

...and since it's almost certain that

the Webbers were killed, the bank is

selling the house and that back parcel

over there that's been re-zoned

commercial. It's right there on the

avenue.

WOMAN BUYER

Is that where the plane crashed?

REALTOR

Yep, right there.

MAN BUYER

This place gives me the willies.

REALTOR

Yeah, I know what you mean. But the

price is right.

ADAM

Al ice in won der lan.

CALVIN

Not bad for a three and a half year

old! I'd like to see the public school

system match that! I don't care how

terrific it is!

HELEN

Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like

his father. But you know, Calvin,

maybe he's a little...young for

school.

CALVIN

Nonsense. People have no idea what the

human mind is capable of. Look at us!

ADAM

(pointing to the book's art

work)

Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,

just like us.

ADAM (cont'd)

Will I ever get to go up on top?

CALVIN

Yes, you certainly will. And you'll

find a nice girl and rebuild America.

Just the way it used to be.

HELEN

Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be

making promises that perhaps can't be

kept.

CALVIN

I believe there will be other

survivors. In fact, I'm guessing

there's life on the surface, even now.

It's not life worth living perhaps,

but believe me, something's moving

around up there. And I don't just mean

the cockroaches.

MOM

I'm going to need two more banana-

splits and a cherry coke!

SODA JERK

You bet, Mom! Coming up!

CALVIN

(to Adam)

Nothing in the world is more fun than

learning new things.

MOM

I can't tell the boys from the girls

anymore!

SODA JERK

(stoned)

Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

HELEN

Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my

turn.

(holding out her hand)

Adam?

MOM

I miss those nice flower-power kids.

How 'bout you?

SODA JERK

(after studying her for some

time)

Um...uh...

MOM

What the hell kind of music is that?!

SODA JERK

Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like

that.

CALVIN

This is what money looks like.  It

comes like this, in coin, or like this

in paper.  Or you can have an

"investment."  These are stock

"certificates" that we bought in your

name.  Of course, they're worthless

now, but at one time they were quite

valuable.

ADAM

They're pretty.  Can I have them?

CALVIN

Sure. Now, let's move on to our French

exam.

ADAM

Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

CALVIN

You're right!  It's Tuesday already!

By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

ADAM

Tempus fugit!

CALVIN

En arte voluptus.

Que les bons temps roulE!

ADAM

Gerade aus dann links!

CALVIN

Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack

sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

ADAM

Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

CALVIN

(marveling)

You know, you have a wonderful sense

of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn

doesn't fall very far from the tree.

By the way, it's time I gave you

something. Come with me.

CALVIN

Hi, honey!

HELEN

Hi.

ADAM

These are wonderful.

CALVIN

It's my entire baseball collection.

It's yours now.

ADAM

What's baseball?

CALVIN

It's a game, son. I can explain it

pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

ADAM

Like a painting?

CALVIN

(chuckling)

No, son. A pitcher.

ADAM

Like one of Mom's?

CALVIN

Uh, no. There's a man who throws the

ball -- to a man who has a bat.

ADAM

The nocturnal flying mammal?

CALVIN

(slightly pissed)

No. Sit down.

MOM

I'm selling this place.  I want out of

this hell hole!

SODA JERK

Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

MOM

Buy it from me?

SODA JERK

Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

MOM

I'll give it to ya, no money down.

The neighborhood has gone to hell

anyway.

SODA JERK

Cool.

CALVIN (OC)

No, no! The runner on second goes to

third! He's out there!

ADAM  (OC)

Why?

CALVIN (OC)

Because he's forced out at third! It's

a force!

ADAM  (OC)

Then why go there?

CALVIN  (OC)

Because he must!

HELEN

Calvin!

CALVIN  (OC)

Coming!

CALVIN (cont'd)

Yes, dear?

HELEN

Get the presents and do the lights.

CALVIN

You bet.

ADAM

Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

CALVIN

Blow out the candles!

HELEN

Make a wish!

ADAM

Oh, boy! A jacket!

CALVIN

Your mom made that all by herself.

ADAM

No kidding!

HELEN

No kidding.

(aside, to Calvin)

Who else would have done it?

CALVIN

And I made these!

ADAM

Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

CALVIN

Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!

I think this new design will work even

better!

ADAM

These are really swell! I mean swell!

HELEN

What did you wish for, Adam?

CALVIN

If he tells, it won't come true!

HELEN

Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We

never believed that in my family!

CALVIN

Well, we did in my family!

ADAM

I wished I could meet a girl.

HELEN

Oh. A nice one, I hope.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

CALVIN

One who doesn't glow in the dark.

HELEN

Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

CALVIN

Well, we'll be going up in two years.

We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

ADAM

(ardently)

Me, too.

HELEN

Let's eat our cake.

CALVIN

Yeah. Let's dig in!

HELEN

Elbows, Son.

ADAM

Sorry, Mom!

HELEN

You never know. You may someday dine

at the White House with the president.

CALVIN

If we still have one.

HELEN

Yes...

CALVIN

You know, when we do go up...I'm going

to miss this old place. How 'bout you,

hon?

HELEN

(after a beat)

Would you excuse me?

CALVIN

Sure.

CALVIN

In the generator room again?

HELEN

Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how

all    these things work.

CALVIN

I know exactly what you mean!

(then)

Hey, honey?

CALVIN (cont'd)

Great cake!!

ADAM

So...we just open this door and go up?

ADAM

Um...is that supposed to happen?

ADAM

Hey, where are we going?!  Is

everything all right?!

CALVIN

Should we say a little prayer first?

HELEN

Just open the door.

ADAM

Well, do we just go on up?!

CALVIN

(quickly back to business,

and way too dramatic)

No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is

precisely when... we must be at our...

most cautious.

HELEN

(barely a whisper, but

definitely tired of his

B.S.)

Oh, shit.

CALVIN

Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have

been down here a little too long!

(to Adam)

Please excuse her French.

ADAM

Shit is a French word?

HELEN

Yes, yes it is!

CALVIN

It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly

meaning..."good".

HELEN

Yes! That's right!

ADAM

Oh.

(then)

Well...then...shit!

CALVIN

C'est bon, Monsieur.

ADAM

Merci!

SODA JERK

...all of these things...Alcoholics

Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin

Anonymous.

OTHER BUM

There's a Heroin Anonymous?

SODA JERK

Shut up! All of these things... ask

you to believe in a power greater than

yourself! Some sort of God on High!

Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a

time or two... and I have certainly

not seen anything coming from up there

except a goddamn airplane -- that I

can't afford to get on!

OTHER BUM

Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

SODA JERK

Let her come!  Let's get this over

with!  And please, if there is a God,

let it be worse in Bel Air!!

SODA JERK

Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!

For I have seen the light!!

CALVIN

I come in peace!!

CALVIN

My, gosh...

CALVIN

Where is my backyard?

STREET WALKER

You got a light, honey?

CALVIN

What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a

light!

STREET WALKER

Good.

CALVIN

So...you...survived the blast, did

you?

STREET WALKER

The blast?  Honey, I have survived a

host of things. Like the song says: "A

country boy can survive!"

CALVIN

Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has

it been...hell up here?

STREET WALKER

"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell

up here, down there and over yonder!

Hell everywhere.

CALVIN

Yes, I can tell that just looking

around.

(then)

"Boy?"  Did you say you were a

"country boy?"

STREET WALKER

Cute Little Old Man, if you want a

boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want

a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be

anything you want me to be!

CALVIN

Really?

STREET WALKER

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the

remarkably low price of only $200!

And if you act now, I might even throw

in some free lawn furniture.

CALVIN

(stumbling away from her)

No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to

go!  I have to...

CALVIN

Hello!  How are you this evening?!

Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

CALVIN

Thank-Q very much!

CALVIN

I'm going to give it to you straight.

There's no point in beating around the

bush. There were survivors.

Apparently,

the fallout has created....a

subspecies of mutants.

HELEN

Mutants?!

CALVIN

It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out

of garbage cans.  Others are...cover

your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that

literally and I mean right now!

CALVIN

Others are...multi-sexual.  It

seems...they can be both masculine and

feminine...simultaneously.

HELEN

No.

CALVIN

Yes.

HELEN

I don't believe it!

CALVIN

Believe it. He tried to sell me his

body, Helen.

(beat)

They offer lawn furniture as a come

on!

CALVIN

They've done a lot of re-building but

society, at least as we knew it, has

utterly collapsed. People throw up in

the streets. Others point guns.

There's something terribly wrong with

the automobiles and...and I...I can't

tell you the rest.  I just can't.

HELEN

Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,

what do we do now?

CALVIN

We stay down here.

HELEN

We do?

CALVIN

Yes.

HELEN

Excuse me.

HELEN

For how long?  We've just about run

out of everything!

CALVIN

We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion

that these mutants will eventually

kill each other off and then--

HELEN

(rising)

No, Calvin.  We're not going to make

do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going

up no matter what!  We deserve it.

Even if it's terrible!

CALVIN

Well, I am the head of this household--

HELEN

I want him to at least see the sky!

CALVIN

--and we will--

HELEN

And the ocean!  A mountain range!

CALVIN

--do as I say!

ADAM

Dad!

HELEN

Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get

him into the bedroom.

HELEN

He seems to be doing all right now.  I

don't know if he's had a heart attack

or just... a horrifying experience.

But we  need supplies and I've got to

stay with him.

ADAM

I'll go up.

HELEN

I'm afraid you've got to.

ADAM

I'll be all right.

HELEN

(patting his cheek)

You're my brave boy.

HELEN

Just act normal.  If anybody asks,

simply say you're from out-of-town,

and that you're in town on business.

Write that down.

HELEN (cont'd)

I'm going to give you a shopping list

and some money.  We need just enough

things to get us through the next year

or two.  And you'll find most of these

items at what used to be called a

grocery store or a hardware store.

Write that down.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

HELEN

I don't know how far you'll have to

travel to find supplies, but if you

can't get home by nightfall, I want

you to look for something called a

Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a

hotel. There might still be one

standing.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

HELEN

Let's get you packed.

ADAM

Right.

HELEN

(indicating money)

I just hope this is still good up

there.

ADAM

Mom?

HELEN

Yes?

ADAM

I was thinking that, uh...you know,

while I was up there and all...that

maybe I could, you know...try to meet

a girl.  I've, been thinking about

that a little...just these

last...fifteen years or so.

HELEN

Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if

you could find a girl. One who's not a

mutant...and hopefully comes from

Pasadena. Nothing against Valley

girls,

but in my day anyhow, the girls from

Pasadena, I don't know...always just

seemed a little nicer.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

HELEN

Oh, there's also a thing called a

liquor store. Write that down.

HELEN

Here's the shopping list and $3,000

which should take care of everything.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

HELEN

Your father has a few final words for

you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw

for you - he loves you so much. We

both do.

ADAM

Heck, I know that mom! You're my

parents.

CALVIN

Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

ADAM

Yes, father?! Yes?

CALVIN

...the pipe tobacco.

ADAM

Yes, sir.  Is that all?

CALVIN

Also...stay out of the "Adult

Bookstore."

ADAM

Adult Bookstore.  Why?

CALVIN

Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

ADAM

I promise. Is that all?

CALVIN

One more thing. If you find a healthy

young woman, bring her back with you.

ADAM

I'll try.

ADAM

Are you all right?

SODA JERK

Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!

But  where is the one who came last

night -- all in yellow?!

ADAM

All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my

father!

SODA JERK

Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!

Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for

my wasted life?!  Everything has been

so awful!!

ADAM

(comforting him)

I know it has been terrible.  But it

wasn't your fault. And now all the

decay is over with and things are

going to get better. You understand?

SODA JERK

Yes.

ADAM

I've got to go, now.

SODA JERK

Of course you do.  I'll stay here and

pray.

ADAM

(picking up his suitcase)

That's always a good idea! Would you

like some money? I have a great deal

of it.

SODA JERK

No. I don't need money anymore -- I

see that now.

ADAM

How do I leave here?

SODA JERK

The front door is open.  Will you be

back?

ADAM

I promise.

BYSTANDER #1

What?  What is it?!

ADAM

The sky!!!

BYSTANDER #1

The sky?  Where?

ADAM

(pointing)

Up there!!

BYSTANDER #1

I don't see anything!

ADAM

Just look!!

WOMAN

What is it!

BYSTANDER #1

(pointing)

He sees something.

MOTHER

What?

CHILD

I see it, mommy!

BYSTANDER #2

Where?!

WOMAN

What is it?

ADAM

I have never in my life seen anything

like this!!!! Nothing even comes

close!!

POSTAL WORKER

Whatcha looking at?

ADAM

Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

POSTAL WORKER

(with attitude)

Say what?!

ADAM

(offering his hand)

How do you do, ma'am.

POSTAL WORKER

(leary, but taking his hand)

I do alright.

ADAM

Good!

PAKISTANI

What is it?!  What do you see?!

ADAM

Oh, no!

PAKISTANI

What?!

ADAM

Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,

it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

CALVIN

You know--

CALVIN (cont'd)

I just wanted to say that I think he's

going to be just fine.

HELEN

(holding her heart)

Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very

much.

CALVIN

He's smart.

HELEN

Yes, dear, I know.

ADAM

Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

ADAM

I tried to give the driver this but he

wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A

lot of people do.

ADAM (cont'd)

Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!

Wow.

ADAM (CONT'D)

So this is public transportation. My

Dad says that it becomes more and more

important because of pollution --

which is more and more carbon dioxide

and other hazardous gases in the air.

(then, confidentially)

Do you have a gun, by the way?

ADAM (cont'd)

Well, thanks for not waving it around.

And for not vomitting, for that

matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,

do you know where I could find a

grocery store?

ADAM (cont'd)

I have to find that. And a hardware

store  and a liquour store and a

standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may

not need the Holiday Inn. That's still

kind of up in the air. It depends

really on how things go.

PSYCHO

(pointing)

There's a grocery store coming up.

ADAM

Thank-Q!

(jumping up)

Driver! Please stop the bus

immediately! I have to get off!

(then an aside to the psycho)

Do you think I should get a gun?

PSYCHO

I don't know...maybe.

ADAM

(back to driver)

Driver! Please stop, sir!

OLD JEWISH MAN

For the love of God! Let him off the

bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

ADAM

I'm sorry, what did you call me?

ADAM

Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

ADAM

Is that a birthday cake?!

CLERK

Yes, it is.

ADAM

Gee-ma-nee!

CLERK

Bakersfield.

ADAM

(to himself)

My first mutants.

ADAM

Is this because of the radiation?

CLERK

What?

ADAM

Nothing.

BUTCHER

Help you?

ADAM

Yes, please.

(consulting his Mom's list)

I'm looking for all beef patties.

BUTCHER

Fresh or frozen?

ADAM

Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

BUTCHER

Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in

the three pound box.

ADAM

Then I'll need, twelve into nine

hundred, seventy-five boxes. And

that's almost...five hundred dollars

just for the hamburger! And my Mom

only gave me three thousand dollars

for everything! The yacht batteries!

The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

BUTCHER

You could have a meat order that big

delivered to your home.

ADAM

Really?!

BUTCHER

Sure.

ADAM

Well, that's great then!

Terrific...except...it just occurred

to me. I don't know where I live! I'm

lost! I don't know where home is!

(then)

Would you excuse me?

BUTCHER

Gladly.

ADAM

Driver! Stop this bus immediately!

Please sir!!

ADAM

Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,

my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

ADAM

Hello.

JERRY

(gives him a look, then goes

back to reading)

Hi.

ADAM

The name is Adam Webber and I see you

buy baseball cards and although these

are a lot older than the ones in the

window, I was hoping you still might

be interested.

JERRY

How--how much do you want for the

Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

ADAM

I was thinking of selling all the

cards.

JERRY

Really? No kidding?

ADAM

See, my problem is, all I have are

hundred dollar bills and I need

something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.

Like that.

JERRY

I see what ya mean. Tell you

what...I'll give you five hundred

dollars in small bills for the whole

box.

ADAM

Oh, that would be wonderful!

JERRY

Well, we're here to help!

EVE (OC)

Oh, shit!

JERRY

I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't

screw me up.

ADAM

Bon soir, mademoiselle!

EVE

Are you French?

ADAM

No.

(then, thinking fast)

I'm from out of town.

(then sensing the need for

further clarification)

I'm here on business.

EVE

Well, your business must not be sports

memorabilia, because this one Mantle

card right here--

(holds up a card)

--is worth six thousand dollars all by

its little self.

ADAM

Get out of here!

EVE

No, you get out of here.

JERRY

Terrific...you're fired! You know

that?!

EVE

No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

JERRY

Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair

salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You

know why you can't keep a goddamn

job?!  Because you can't keep your

goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

ADAM

Sir? I would really appreciate it if

you wouldn't take the Lord's name in

vain again.

JERRY

(looking at Adam's hand)

Oh, you got a problem with that?

ADAM

I have a big problem with that.

EVE

Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to

the corner.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.

EVE

Just come on.

JERRY

Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect

match!  I hope you two will be very

happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!

Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!

I'm serious this time! You're finished

in the hobby business! Take that to

the bank, why don'tcha!

ADAM

I didn't want to leave without saying

how much I admire your jewelry.

JERRY

Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your

butt?

ADAM

How 'bout you what?

EVE

I said come on!

ADAM

Where are we going?

EVE

We? I'm going home. And, judging by

that coat, I'd say you have to get

back to the barber college.

ADAM

No, I'm lost.

EVE

You're lost?

ADAM

Say,...did you just lose your job

because of me?

EVE

Forget it.  I'm sick of working for

that dickhead.

ADAM

Dickhead?

EVE

A walking penis capable of intelligent

speech.  A dickhead.

EVE

What's wrong with you?

ADAM

I just had a mental picture of...

EVE

Here, pick these up!

EVE (cont'd)

Where are you parked?

ADAM

I came on a bus.

EVE

Why doesn't that surprise me?

ADAM

I don't know. Why doesn't it?

EVE

Well, I guess because I'm a little

psychic...I have this thing.

ADAM

Oh, that's nice.

EVE

Let me guess something. This is your

first visit to La La Land. You're

staying somewhere over in Hollywood

because, like an idiot, you thought

that would be an exciting place to

stay.  Right so far?

ADAM

(could be a question, could

be an answer.)

So far?

EVE

Yes, I'm right?

ADAM

Right.

EVE

I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus

and before you know it, you're out

here in the San Fernando Valley

without a clue.  Which brings us to

here.  Correct again?

ADAM

Again.

EVE

Where are you staying? The Holiday

Inn?

ADAM

Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's

exactly right!

EVE

See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but

pretty much. That was pretty good,

wasn't it?!

ADAM

It was amazing.

EVE

Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a

bus for you to get on.

ADAM

Do you own a car?

EVE

I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.

Rule Number One in North America: No

strangers in the car.

ADAM

If it will make you feel any better, I

don't have a gun.

EVE

You don't?

ADAM

Nope.

EVE

Well, that changes everything. Get the

fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

ADAM

I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,

didn't I!  Please forgive me!

EVE

Get away from me!!

ADAM

Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal

with you!  I'll give you a Rogers

Hornsby, if you'll take me to the

hotel!

EVE

Rogers Hornsby?!?

ADAM

He's all yours. I was holding him

back.

EVE

Rogers Hornsby's worth like four

thousand dollars!

ADAM

So what?!  I've got two of him!

(removing more cards from his

pocket)

And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.

I was holding these out, too.

EVE

So for four thousand dollars, all I

have to do is drive you to your hotel?

ADAM

Yes.

EVE

And that's it?

ADAM

Yes.

EVE

I don't have to take a physical in

your space ship?

ADAM

Heck, no!  What?!

EVE

Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.

Get in.

EVE (cont'd)

The front seat!

EVE (cont'd)

Why am I doing this? What in the hell

is wrong with me? That's what I'd like

to know.

EVE

So...Mister Andretti, your first time

on the freeway?

ADAM

It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

EVE

Mind if I change the station?

Better traffic reports on AM.

ADAM

Wait!  Wait!

EVE

What is it?!

ADAM

It's Perry!

EVE

Perry?

ADAM

Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!

Go back!

EVE

Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

EVE

How's that?

ADAM

(star-struck)

Oh, I could die...

EVE

Over this?

ADAM

Yeah! Listen to this part. This is

where it really takes off!

EVE

You are one scary son-of-a-gun.

ADAM

Hey, what are you doing?!

EVE

I know a short-cut.

ADAM

Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

EVE

I can't help it. Perry Como always

does this to me! I just get so

cranked!

EVE

Card, please.  End of service.

ADAM

That was...wonderful!  I've never felt

anything like that in my life.

EVE

Yeah, same here. Don't forget your

suitcase.

ADAM

Right.

ADAM

You know--

ADAM

Good evening. I want to stay at this

hotel.

CLERK

Fill this out please. And I'll need a

card.

ADAM

A card?

CLERK

Yes, sir.

ADAM

Of course!

BELLBOY

Bathroom's there, TV's over there.

Remote's on top. Room Service menu is

on the table.

BELLBOY (CONT'D)

You dial nine to get out.

ADAM

(beat, then)

Of what?

BELLBOY

(beat, then)

The hotel.

ADAM

(beat, then he hangs up)

I see.  Well, thank you very much.

You've been very, very nice.

ADAM (cont'd)

I was able to get some change

downstairs and my father taught me

that it's customary to tip in a

situation such as this.

BELLBOY

Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

ADAM

My father is a genius.

BELLBOY

No kiddin'. Well...good night.

ADAM

Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let

the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom

always says...

(choking up)

...who I'm really beginning to miss.

I'm sorry.  It's my first night away

from home.

BELLBOY

How old are you?

ADAM

Thirty-five.

BELLBOY

You don't look thirty-five.

ADAM

How old do I look?

BELLBOY

Twenty-five? Around there.

ADAM

I guess living up here makes people

look older.

BELLBOY

Up here on the fifteenth floor?

ADAM

(catching himself)

Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.

Goodnight.

BELLBOY

Goodnight.

CALVIN

And Lord we ask finally that you send

an angel to look after and protect our

beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

HELEN

Amen.

EVE

(skyward)

What in the hell am I doing here?!

That's what I'd like to know! Somebody

tell me that.

DESK CLERK

You don't have a last name?

EVE

All I know is that his first name is

Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

ADAM

(into phone, after a long

pause)

Yes?

EVE

(into phone)

Hi. This is the woman from the

baseball card store.  Remember me?

ADAM

Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog!

Thank you for calling me on the

telephone!!

EVE

Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the

lobby.

(pause, then)

On the first floor! Where the hell

else would it be?

ADAM

I am so glad to see you!!  I thought

I'd never see you again!

EVE

Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball

card) I can't take this for driving

you home. I wish I could, but I can't.

So here, take it back. I could have

just left it for you at the desk, but

it's very valuable. Now take it.

ADAM

I can't, it's yours.

EVE

Take it. damn it!

ADAM

(with hand over his mouth)

Okay.

EVE

Why are you doing that?

ADAM

I haven't brushed yet.

EVE

Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your

visit.

ADAM

Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

EVE

Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

EVE

I knew this would happen!  You're like

a lost puppy!

ADAM

Can't you please just talk to me for

one second?

EVE

Okay!  Damn!

EVE (CONT'D)

I should have taken the money and run!

That's what Troy told me to do!  But

do I listen?  No! Put your hand down!

ADAM

Troy? Is he your husband? Or a

boyfriend?

EVE

No.

ADAM

(eyes to heaven)

Thank-Q!

EVE

Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know

you like me.  I can tell. But you know

what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me,

exactly. It's more like the legs or

the butt or the hair.  Or some

combination of the above.

ADAM

I think it's the eyes.

EVE

The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow,

it never works out.  Okay?  Not that

you even need to know that!  You look

like crap, by the way.  What have you

been doing?

ADAM

Watching television in color.

EVE

Hey, no kidding?  In color?

ADAM

Cross my heart and hope to die.

EVE

See, ya.

ADAM

Why doesn't it never work out?

EVE

What?

ADAM

Why does it never work out?  You

and...men?

EVE

Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

EVE (cont'd)

Okay, if you promise to leave me

alone, I'll tell you.

ADAM

...Okay.

EVE

It never works out because I'm into

legs and butts and hair myself!

That's why! So I wind up with guys who

are very good looking, but

even more shallow than I am, if you

can picture that.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go

find another low-paying, demeaning job

where some guy named Jerry keeps

telling me how lousy his marriage is.

ADAM

Why not go to work for me?

EVE

Doing what?

ADAM

Selling all my baseball cards.

And helping me buy enough food and

supplies to fill several large trucks.

EVE

Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like

starving people?

ADAM

Well, they're not starving yet, but

they need help.

EVE

How long would you need me?

ADAM

Two weeks.

EVE

What's the pay?

ADAM

What's fair?

EVE

I've got to make at least a thousand a

week.

ADAM

You got it!

Wait here while I change.

EVE

Sure.

EVE

(to herself)

My career's finally taking off...

MANAGER

Why would someone need twenty yacht

batteries?

EVE

I just work for the guy.

MANAGER

And who does he work for?  The CIA?

EVE

Naw...it's some sort of charity

thing..I guess for starving people

with yachts.

EVE

Why not buy them milk or something--

instead of Dr. Pepper?

ADAM

They like Dr. Pepper.

EVE

Who are these people?

ADAM

My Mom and Dad.

EVE

Very funny, smart ass.

ADAM

Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need

all of this! This is swell!

EVE

(to herself)

Swell? Run, Eve.  Run.

ADAM

Wait! Wait!

EVE

What?

EVE

Well, another day, another dollar.

(then)

Stop staring at me!!

ADAM

Sorry.

EVE

Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

ADAM

Hey, you know. I was thinking...

EVE

Night!

ADAM

Night!

ADAM

We'll have to rent a refrigerated

truck for the beef and poultry.

EVE

It's your life.  And, by the way, it's

a dandy.

ADAM

I guess we'll need another locker.

EVE

No problem.  We'll just sell another

baseball card.

ADAM

You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? -

-  but, I'd just be lost without you.

EVE

Thank you.

ADAM

And, um ...I guess...

I guess you and I, uh...

EVE

Adam?  Don't even think about it.

Okay?

I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean,

but believe me, it would be meaner if

I didn't say it. Okay?

ADAM

Okay.

EVE

Now, let's take the truck back and get

something to eat.

ADAM

There's something else I would like

you to help me with.

EVE

Name it.

ADAM

Well, this is going to sound a little

crazy.

EVE

(laughing)

Oh, I'm sure it will!

ADAM

Then forget it.

EVE

No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

ADAM

This is for me.

EVE

Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.

ADAM

Well... Okay. I would like you to help

me find a...wife.

EVE

A wife?

ADAM

Yes.

EVE

What for?

ADAM

Because I want to get married.

EVE

Why?!

ADAM

I don't want to be alone.

EVE

You can be single and not alone.

Marriage bites!

ADAM

Bites what?

EVE

The big one!

ADAM

It does?

EVE

Sure.

ADAM

I didn't know that.

EVE

Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced

sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and

dad.

ADAM

They're all divorced?

EVE

Everybody's divorced.

ADAM

It didn't used to be that way.

EVE

I wouldn't know.

(then)

What kind of wife are you looking for?

ADAM

One who's not a mutant.

EVE

No dogs, huh? Okay.

ADAM

And if possible, I'd like to marry

someone from Pasadena.

EVE

When do you need her by?

ADAM

Two weeks.

EVE

Well, I could probably get you laid in

two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant

wife from Pasadena...that could take

some

time.

ADAM

That's what I was afraid of.

ADAM

What do you mean, you can get me laid?

EVE

Could we talk about that a little

later?

ADAM

Of course.

EVE

(sugary, to waitress)

Thank you.

EVE

Get out!

ADAM

The engine is still running.

EVE

Now, get out!!

ADAM

Yes, ma'am!

EVE

Stop that ma'am crap!

ADAM

Sorry!

EVE

You almost got us killed!

ADAM

I told you I've never driven before!

EVE

Never drive again!

ADAM

You said it would be easy!

EVE

I was wrong!!

ADAM

Is this your house?

EVE

Yes!

ADAM

I like it.

EVE

Swell!

CLIFF

What are you bitching about now?

EVE

What are you doing here?

CLIFF

I forgot some of my stuff.

EVE

Your stuff?  Let me see that.

EVE

You came back for these?

CLIFF

Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's

this interesting looking fellow?

EVE

This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

ADAM

(offering hand)

How do you do?

CLIFF

I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?

(eyeing Eve)

You doin' any good?

EVE

Go home, Cliff, wherever that might

be.

CLIFF

Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember

her?  The model who went to Harvard?

Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.

Nice coat!

ADAM

Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met

you, Cliff!

(then to her)

May I ask you a question?

EVE

He's a former boyfriend. We lived

together for about six months.  And

yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind

of got a thing for him.

(entering the house)

That's what you wanted to know, isn't

it?

ADAM

(following)

Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff

likes to wear another man's

underpants.

EVE

(OC)

What?!

TROY

(sotto)

Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

EVE

I knew you'd like him.

TROY

Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think

about it!  The guy's got all this

easily negotiable property. He's

obviously setting something up very

big.  Like a self-sustaining island

off the coast of South America, for

instance. Or perhaps he's the head of

a cult that's doing weird things with

poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard

worse.

ADAM

You have very nice ceilings.

TROY

I do? Well, thank you! You like

ceilings?

ADAM

Not particularly.

TROY

Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea

urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"

if you prefer. I love sushi.

ADAM

I love Lucy!

TROY

You nut!

EVE

Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

ADAM

Thank-Q!

EVE

I thought only hookers drank those

things.

ADAM

Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

TROY

Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't

we sit and chat.

TROY

So, Adam...where on earth are you

from?

EVE

Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

ADAM

It's a very small place. People don't

even know it's there.

TROY

And it's called...?

ADAM

Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

TROY

Really?  Since when?

EVE

(defensive)

Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm

Springs.

TROY

Oh, yes.

EVE

I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

ADAM

Right on the button.

TROY

Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home

town.

EVE

Give me your hand.

TROY

(to himself)

Oh, my God...

EVE

Okay, let's see...I'm not promising

anything. You okay?

ADAM

Um-hum.

EVE

I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.

Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

ADAM

Yes!

EVE

You live in...Alaska.  The only way in

or out of your place is by plane

and... you've definitely come down

here for food and supplies and... to

find a wife!

ADAM

Wow.

TROY

That's right?

ADAM

(to Eve)

I've never met anyone like you in my

life.

TROY

She's right?!

EVE

Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.

ADAM

I've got goose-bumps all over me.

TROY

Why not just go to... Nome for

supplies and a wife?  Isn't that

closer?

EVE

Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to

find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the

way.

ADAM

Good for you.

TROY

Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask

you a few questions.  When did Alaska

become a state?

ADAM

1959.

TROY

Who use to own it?

ADAM

Russia.

TROY

When did we get it from them?

ADAM

1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2

million dollars for it. A tidy sum

then, as well as now. I'm quoting my

father, of course.

TROY

What's the capitol?

ADAM

Juneau.

TROY

Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

ADAM

Sorry, that's the largest city.

ADAM

Where's he gone?

EVE

He's gone to check your answers on his

computer.

ADAM

He has a computer?

EVE

Sure.

ADAM

In the house?

EVE

No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of

course, in the house.  It's in there.

ADAM

May I please be excused?

EVE

Uh...yeah.

ADAM

This must be very new.

TROY

Yeah.

ADAM

It's so small.

TROY

What are you talking about? This is

the new Mac. You a hacker?

ADAM

I don't think so.

TROY

You don't have a computer in your

cabin?

ADAM

No.

TROY

How do you get through those winters?

(reading screen)

Well, you're right.  Juneau.

(then, covering the

screen with his hand)

What's the highest peak?

ADAM

Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest

point in North America.

TROY

(after peeking at the screen)

Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go

eat!

ADAM

(indicating computer)

That would knock my father out.

TROY

Yeah?

ADAM

Oh, yes.

(to himself)

It would probably kill him.

TROY

He's a Windows guy then, huh?

ADAM

Yes. He likes windows.

TROY

Well, I think Windows stink. What do

you think of that?

ADAM

...I guess it's...just a matter of

personal taste.

TROY

True.

SODA JERK

Who are you?!

HELEN

(beat, then)

I'm the mother.

SODA JERK

It's the mother!!

TROY

But first, you have to start with the

clothes!

EVE

Exactly.

(then to Adam)

You understand that, don't you?  You

have no chance of meeting a woman

dressed like that.

ADAM

All right.

EVE

(to Troy)

So, what are you seeing?

TROY

(looking Adam over)

I don't know.

EVE

Money is no object.  He's got cards up

the wazoo.

ADAM

The what?

EVE

Wazoo!  Try to listen.

(then to Troy)

Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-

hop, Euro trash?

TROY

You're serious, aren't you?

EVE

What's that supposed to mean?

TROY

It means that your taste in men's

apparel is as bad as your taste in

men.

EVE

Well, that's blunt!

TROY

I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

EVE

And I suppose you see him in some sort

of strapless  thing, don't you?

TROY

I see "elegant."

EVE

Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

TROY

That's what I'm sensing.

ADAM

The guy with the underpants!

EVE

That's boring!

TROY

(indicating Adam)

Not on him.

ADAM

I'm not wearing his pants.

TROY

Why not? He has great pants.

ADAM

I just don't want to.

TROY

Okay.

EVE

Why don't you take him and pick out

his clothes?

TROY

Alright, I will.

EVE

(talking with her mouth full)

I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to

buy six thousand paper napkins.

TROY

What do you think, Adam?

ADAM

About clothing?

EVE

Yeah.

ADAM

Whatever you two want. If you've got

the time, I've got the wazoo.

TROY

Isn't it a little tiring to sit up

straight like that?

ADAM

No.

EVE

What about holding your right arm up

like that all the time?

ADAM

It's fine. Just give it a try.

And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot

off the chair!

ADAM

I guess a lot of those tall buildings

we saw this morning are new.

TROY

Almost all of them.

ADAM

The recovery is very impressive.

TROY

The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they

rebuilt the freeway in six months.

ADAM

Amazing. I'm very impressed.

TROY

Well, what do you think?

EVE

I think...it...works.

TROY

Let me show you the entire trousseau!

ADAM

But first let me show her these!

ADAM (cont'd)

Eve, can I skate around your block?

TROY

(making it sexual)

How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around

your block?

EVE

(beat, then)

No.

EVE

He's going to kill himself.

(then, to Adam)

Go skate out on the bike path! It's

that way!

ADAM

Okay!

EVE

That water's freezing!

TROY

He's from Alaska.

TROY

That's why little things mean so much

to him.

ADAM

I LOVE THIS!!

TROY

(defensive)

What?! He wanted to hear some

standards!

ADAM

I get it! I finally get it! You have

to see it to understand it!

ADAM

Hey, Eve!

EVE

Have you ever heard the saying, "He

hasn't got enough sense to come in out

of the rain?"

ADAM

Yep.

(then watching the rain hit

the palm of his hand)

You know, my father -- who is a

scientist -- says that everything is a

miracle. Everything. Until recently I

wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

EVE

Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still

want to go girl hunting tonight?

ADAM

I certainly do!

EVE

Okay. But you know, this business of

finding you a wife -- it's kind of

ridiculous, don't you think?

ADAM

(rising)

No it's not!

EVE

Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a

wife? I mean...

ADAM

Then just help me find a girlfriend!

That's all I ask.

I'll give you every single card I've

got left!

EVE

Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm

just somebody you can buy off! Listen,

let me tell you something--

ADAM

(taking her by the arms)

Would you do it just because you're my

friend? My very best friend.

EVE

Well...yeah. Okay.

ADAM

Thank Q, Eve!

ADAM

Why did you park way back there?

TROY

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total

strangers drive her car.

ADAM

Oh. I see.

TROY

What?!

ADAM

Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

ADAM

My goodness gracious!  This place is

something!

EVE

Look unimpressed.

TROY

Bored even.

TROY

Vaguely bored!

EVE

Unimpressed, but still interested.

EVE

No!  Not crazy!

ADAM

Do I look crazy?

EVE

Yes!

TROY

Be loose.

EVE

Just be yourself.

TROY

Always good advice.

EVE

For him. It doesn't work for the rest

of us.

ADAM

Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place

is neat-o!!

EVE

Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,

that's them!

ADAM

How do you do?! It's very nice to meet

you, Jason and Jonathan!

(confidentially, to them)

My mother always told me that if you

meet a person for the first time it's

easier to remember their names if you

use those names right away.

TROY

He's from Alaska!

JASON/JONATHAN

(relieved)

Oh!

SOPHIE

Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?

EVE

Get lost, Sophie.

SOPHIE

Hi. I'm Sophie.

ADAM

Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.

JASON

Adam lives in Alaska.

SOPHIE

No shit?

ADAM

Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon

accent.

SOPHIE

You speak beautiful French!

J'ai habitE a Paris un an.

ADAM

Paris!! La ville de lumieres!

C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour

pratiquer le francais.

SOPHIE

Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer

beaucoup des choses ensemble.

EVE

Quit showing off!  We're here on

business!

ADAM

Good-bye!

SOPHIE

Non, cherie. A bientot.

ADAM

I thought I was here to meet women.

EVE

Not that one!

ADAM

I like her.

EVE

And don't be so obvious!

EVE

What have you ordered?

ADAM

It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink,

I'm told.

ADAM (OC)

What about her?

EVE (OC)

No way.

ADAM

Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

EVE

Adam!  She's got bitch written all

over her!  You do know what "bitch"

means, don't you?

ADAM

Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't

understand for the life of me why you

would call her that!  Or why Cliff

would say that about you.

EVE

Because we're bitches!  Look at her!

Look at the expression on her face!

The walk, the jewelry, the

fingernails.  Please!

ADAM

How 'bout this one?

EVE

Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even

be a crumb on her table!  You don't

see that?!

TROY

Eve?!

EVE

Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's

nothing personal.

TROY

Adam,  I think for you, we should go

for "sweet."

ADAM

Okay. I like that.

EVE

(swigging her drink)

Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of

putting it.

ADAM

(to Troy)

What do I say to Miss Sweet when I

meet her?

TROY

Um... Eve?

EVE

It's not so much what you say but how

you say it.  Women like men who are

unpredictable.

ADAM

Really?

EVE

Yes, really! Basically, they want what

they think they can't have.  Same with

guys.  That's why everybody is walking

around here sending off "you can't

have me" signals!

ADAM

That's ridiculous.

EVE

Maybe. But that's how it works.

TROY

Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the

hors d'oeuvres table!

EVE

Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo.

Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

ADAM

(very serious)

Okay. All right.

(then)

And what do I say?

EVE

Say something surprising. And funny.

Lie, if need be.

TROY

Yes! Lying is always a very effective

dating tool.

ADAM

Okay. Thank you, my friends.

ADAM (cont'd)

By the way, that's a great play.

EVE

What?

ADAM

Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

EVE

Did you?

TROY

I'm not sure I want to watch this.

ADAM

(to himself)

Surprising and funny. Well, I know a

duck who bought some lip balm...

ADAM

MISS SWEET

(not sweet)

Yes?

ADAM

(beat, then)

I was wondering if you might help me.

I...I seem to have lost my

Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere

around here.

MISS SWEET

Oh, now, that's a great one!

ADAM

(big smile)

You like it?

MISS SWEET

(a little clap)

Bravo!

ADAM

Thank-Q!

MISS SWEET

This is my new friend...

ADAM

I'm Adam Webber.

MISS SWEET

He's really funny!

HEATHER

Hi!  I'm Heather!

ADAM

"Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever

heard that name before.

HEATHER

Yeah, right!

MISS SWEET

I told you!  He's funny!

MISS SWEET

We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're

both professional dancers.

ADAM

Really?

HEATHER

You dance?

ADAM

I took a dance lesson everyday of my

life until a couple of days ago.

MISS SWEET

You're kidding!

ADAM

No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

MISS SWEET

Your mom was a dancer?

ADAM

She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You

would like her very much! Shall we

dance?

MISS SWEET

Sure.

TROY

You know, he's a very, very good--

EVE

Shut up!

TROY

Must you...

TROY

What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

MISS SWEET

Is that your girl friend?

ADAM

No. Would you please excuse me?

HEATHER

If you'll please come back.

ADAM

I will certainly try.  And thank you

both very much for the dance.

MISS SWEET

When was the last time you saw manners

like that?

HEATHER

Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner

or something.

EVE

(to Troy)

Go to the bathroom.

TROY

Right here?

(then, off her look)

Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't

sure!

ADAM

You wanted to see me!

EVE

You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you

learn to dance like that?!  And there

are no starving people, are there?!

ADAM

Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

EVE

Don't change the subject! I want you

to tell me the truth about yourself.

ADAM

I've never lied to you.  I've maybe

let you believe things that you wanted

to believe, but I've never lied.

EVE

You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't

you?!

ADAM

No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love

with you the first time I saw you.

(off her look)

I did. I think that you are the most--

EVE

I want to know exactly who you are and

what you're really up to!

ADAM

All right. Let me tell you the whole

thing. In 1962--

CLIFF (OC)

Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up

nice?

ADAM

Hello, Cliff, how are you this

evening?

CLIFF

Not bad.

CLIFF

But I do miss that green sport coat of

yours.

ADAM

Thank you very much. But, Cliff,

that's my seat. And I was just--

CLIFF

(to Eve)

How 'bout a drink at the bar?

EVE

(pause, then)

Sure.

CLIFF

It's all yours.

EVE

So where is your roommate, the model?

CLIFF

You know, I don't know.  And looking

at you, I don't care.  It's been too

long, Eve.

ADAM (OC)

Please excuse this interruption.

CLIFF

Oh, brother...

ADAM

Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and

please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't

Cliff just a butt with hair?

CLIFF

What?!

ADAM

I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and

hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,

as well?

CLIFF

(the shallowest guy in the

world)

Shallow? I'm shallow?!

EVE

Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

CLIFF

Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

ADAM

Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to

defend myself.

CLIFF

Do ya?

EVE

Stop it, you two!

CLIFF

(slightly insecure)

I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

ADAM

(lowering his guard)

Yes, I agree.

EVE

Adam?!

ADAM

I'm sorry.

CLIFF

(increasingly insecure)

Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.

Fighting is pretty immature.

ADAM

(lowering his guard)

It certainly is.  I agree with you

completely.

CLIFF

Eve? I'm leaving.

EVE

I don't blame you!

ADAM

(turning to Eve)

Eve, I'm sorry.

CLIFF

(deeply insecure)

Well, good night, everyone.

EVE

I'm leaving, too.

ADAM

But, Eve, I would--

EVE

And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you

out--because I quit!  This is

ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm

ridiculous!

EVE

He go back to the hotel?

TROY

Uh..he might of.

EVE

What's that mean?

TROY

We did not leave together.

EVE

Who did he leave with?

TROY

What's it to you?!

EVE

I'm his pimp. He left with the

dancers, didn't he?

TROY

Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the

psychic pimp.  You tell me.

EVE

Those sluts!

TROY

Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?

EVE

Where are you going?

TROY

To bed.

EVE

To bed?

TROY

Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love

with the guy.

EVE

What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn

minute!

EVE

In the first place, I don't fall in

love with weirdos I've only known for

four or five days.

TROY

Yes, you do.

EVE

And I don't fall in love with grown

men who collect baseball cards!!

TROY

Uh, yes, you do.

EVE

Or pee in their pants when they see

the ocean!

TROY

Yes, you do!

EVE

Or have perfect table manners.

TROY

(sitting up)

You know, I asked him about that. And

he said that good manners are a way we

have of showing other people that we

respect them. See, you'd eat like a

slob if you

were alone, but since another human

being is present, you show that person

respect by going to the trouble of

having proper manners. I didn't know

that. I thought it was a way of

appearing superior.

(then)

Know what else he told me?

EVE

(sitting on the bed)

What?

TROY

He thinks that I am a gentleman and

that you are a lady!

EVE

Well, consider the source. I don't

even know what a lady is.

TROY

Exactly! I thought a gentleman was

somebody who owned horses. Turns out,

the short and very simple definition

of a gentleman or a lady is: someone

who always attempts to make the people

around him or her feel as comfortable

as possible. That's it! If you don't

do that, nothing else matters. The

cars, the clothes, the houses...

EVE

Where did he get all that information?

TROY

From the oddest place. His parent's

told him. I don't think I got that

memo.

EVE

So now I suppose he's trying to make

those two dancers feel as comfortable

as possible.

TROY

He didn't leave with them.

EVE

Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear

that.

TROY

He left with Sophie.

EVE

What?!!

TROY

It's true.  She swept him out the door

whispering little French things into

his ear.

EVE

Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please

don't tell me that!!

TROY

What are you going to do? Go over to

her place and kick in the door?

EVE

You're goddamn right I am!

EVE (cont'd)

You coming?!

TROY

(cringing)

I don't think so.

EVE

Coward!

TROY

Gentleman coward, to you.

EVE

Come on!  Come on, damn it!

ADAM

Hi!

ADAM

Eve?!

EVE

Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You

stupid son of a bitch!!!

ADAM

I'm really sorry!

EVE

What in the hell are you doing here!!

You're supposed to be over on San

Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex

with that slut Sophie!!

ADAM

I know...and I'm really sorry.

EVE

Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,

my heart is in my neck!

ADAM

What?

EVE

Goodnight!

ADAM

Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

EVE

Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is

that?!  What if this is for life?!

ADAM

I know first aid!

EVE

Well, you had better!!

EVE

Wait a minute.

EVE

There.

ADAM

Thanks.

ADAM

Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all

right in no time.

ADAM

I went to Sophie's and she was very

hospitable.

EVE

Is that what you call it?

ADAM

But it just wasn't where I wanted to

be so I left as politely as I could

and found a taxi.  But I asked the

driver to drop me here instead of at

the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como

sings called "On the Street Where You

Live."  You know it?

EVE

Sing it to me.

ADAM

(softly, saying it as much as

singing it)

"All at once am I--several stories

high-- knowing I'm--on the street--

where you live."  It's about a young

man who is overjoyed just to be

standing in front of the house of the

person he loves.

EVE

Adam...dumb question, but humor me.

Have you ever had sex before?

ADAM

No.

EVE

How is that possible?

ADAM

(sitting up)

In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on

Los Angeles, my parents were in our

fallout shelter.  That's where I was

born. We

only survived because it was a huge

shelter as fallout shelters go. My

father worked on it secretly for

years. When he had to, he used

contractors, but always from out-of-

state and always for just a portion of

the job. He told them it was a secret

government experiment done through

CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he

felt in this case he had no choice. Of

course, it had to be a secret, because

we had just enough supplies to last

three people thirty-five years. That's

also why I have no brothers or

sisters. The air vent was the really

tricky part, but he was able to cut

into a flood control sewer. What I'd

like to do Eve, is take you down into

the fallout shelter with me. We could

live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad

said if I found a healthy girl I

should "bring her on down". And you

look plenty healthy to me.

EVE

Uh-huh. Adam?

ADAM

Yes, Eve?

EVE

I want you to go back to the hotel

now.  I'll call you a cab.

ADAM

Of course.  I shouldn't be over here

at this hour.

EVE

That's right.  And I'll see you in the

morning in the lobby.  Do you mind

waiting outside for the taxi?

ADAM

Not at all.  And Eve thank you for

tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

EVE

My pleasure.

ADAM

It was at least as good as the sky.

EVE

Really?  Okay!

ADAM

And I think better than the ocean. I'm

serious!

EVE

Neat. Goodnight!

TROY

Goddamn, Adam!

ADAM

Wait a minute!

TROY

I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in

vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

ADAM

No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back

there!  I'll be right back!

TROY

Without question, the strangest man

I've ever met.

SODA JERK

Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!

Give us some sort of sign!

ADAM

Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef

frozen patties!

TROY

How 'bout we check with Eve first?

ADAM

You bet!

TROY

So, did you buy a movie?

ADAM

What?

TROY

A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the

bookstore.

ADAM

(concentrating on his

driving)

No, I wouldn't go in one of those

places with a gas mask on.

TROY

(laughing in agreement)

I know what you mean!  I usually wear

a big hat and dark glasses.

ADAM

Does that work?

TROY

Yeah...Seems to.

ADAM

Hi, Eve!

EVE

Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

ARON

I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

ADAM

How do you do?

ARON

Very well, thank you. I'm with the

County Family Services Department. Eve

tells me you've been living in a bomb

shelter most of your life.

ADAM

Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

ARON

Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my

associate -- Mr. Brown.

ADAM

Hello.

ARON

We want you to come with us so we can

talk some more about your experiences.

ADAM

Come where?

ARON

My office.

ADAM

For how long?

ARON

Well, that depends...

ADAM

I thank you very much for the

invitation, but I'm quite busy today.

Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

EVE

Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.

It's the best thing.  The best thing

for you. I promise.

ADAM

...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

EVE

...I do.

ADAM

(to Aron)

Could I please just go home?  I was

lost, but this morning I found home

and I promise not to bother any of you

ever again.

ARON

Let's go talk first, Adam.

ADAM

Yes, ma'am.

TROY

Good-bye, Adam.

ADAM

Goodbye.

ARON

(to Eve)

You'll be hearing from me.

EVE

Well what was I supposed to do?! He

wants me to live underground with him!

That's like Silence of the Lambs,

don't you think?!

TROY

I know...I know. You did the right

thing.

EVE

Oh, no!

TROY

What?!

EVE

Oh, my God!

ARON

He'll catch him.

(then into phone)

Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run

away and I'm going to need police

assistance.

EVE

No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

ARON

I have to. If a complaint is made and

the person resists obser--

EVE

No, I can't have that! They'll come

with their cars and their guns and

their handcuffs--

ARON

Calm down, please. This man needs help

and you need protection from him.

That's obvious.

EVE

You know, I don't think so. I'm

confused but you know, I don't think

he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd

hurt anyone.

ARON

And now you must let me be the judge

of that!

EVE

I was frightened and I didn't know

what to think! But you know-I believe

him. I think he just wants to go home.

Wherever the hell that is...

ARON

Let's all remain calm. That's the key

thing.

ADAM

The key to my hotel room!  I want you

to have my baseball cards!

(running to the truck)

And please be sure to pay my bill!

ARON

Young man, stop right there!

ARON

Stop, right now! Get out of that

truck!

TROY

Adam, you really shouldn't try to

drive that truck!

ADAM

(starting the engine)

Bye, Troy!

TROY

Bye, Adam!

ADAM

And thanks for always being happy!

TROY

What?

EVE

Gay.

TROY

Oh.

(yelling to Adam)

Well, you're...certainly welcome!

ARON

Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a

bitch!!

ARON (cont'd)

Where the hell have you been?!

BROWN

I fell down!

(to Troy and Eve)

What's the license number of that

truck?!

ARON

Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up

as the other guy!

TROY

Let's all just try to remain calm.

That's the key thing.

ARON

How 'bout I just knock the shit out of

you?!

TROY

I guess he took what he could.

EVE

(putting her head in her

hand)

Good God...you don't think there

really is a bomb shelter, do you?

TROY

Fallout shelter.

TROY (cont'd)

There's a difference.

ADAM (OC)

Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

ADAM

I've got almost everything we need!

And this nice man...

SODA JERK

Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

ADAM

...and his church group have

volunteered to help us bring the

supplies down.  But we've got to

hurry.

HELEN

Are you in trouble, son?!

ADAM

I think I'm being chased by a

psychiatrist.

HELEN

A psychiatrist?!

SODA JERK

It happens.

HELEN

My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

SODA JERK

Horrible.

CALVIN

You have something on your forehead.

SODA JERK

I know.

TROY

This it?

TROY

What do you want to do with it?

EVE

Give it back to him.

TROY

And if we can't find him?

EVE

We'll find him.

TROY (OC)

Hey, Eve?  Eve?

TROY

What's wrong?

EVE

I don't know.  Everything's so neat.

It's all just so...goddamn dear.

(starting to cry)

Damn!

TROY

See these?  Found them in the box with

the cards.  These are stock

certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

TROY (cont'd)

(looking at the toothpaste)

Ipana. I think I remember that brand.

(then)

Oh, here, you should read this.

"Trademark, 1961."

JASON

Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten

thousand shares of each?  They'd be

worth millions. Hell, I don't

know...millions upon millions upon

millions!  How 'bout that?

TROY

Thanks, Jason.

TROY

Millions upon millions upon millions!

The cards. The stock!  The clothes!

The toothpaste!  The guy was on the

level!  And you blew it!  A man walks

into your life who is the kindest,

most polite, honest, trustworthy,

incredibly rich guy you have ever met

in your life!! And what do you do?!

EVE

Have him committed.

TROY

Yeah! That's thinking.

EVE

He was always so "nice"! How was I

supposed to know that's a good thing?!

"Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is

"nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you

that.

(beat, then)

Was it ever?

TROY

I don't know. I like to think so.

EVE

Well, at least I fell for him before I

found out he was rich! That's new.

(then)

Wait a minute! He said today he knew

where home was. What happened this

morning?! Where did you go?!

TROY

To get some frozen poultry.

EVE

Then what?

TROY

We came back to the house!

EVE

You didn't stop anywhere else?!

TROY

No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a

porno store.

EVE

What?!

TROY

An adult bookstore. He was very

excited about seeing it. You think

home is under a dirty bookstore in the

Valley?

EVE

Come on.

TROY

Trendy address.

EVE

(to Pakistani)

Have you got a basement?

PAKISTANI

(indicating merchandise)

Believe me, all the really good stuff

is right here.

EVE

Is there a back entrance?

PAKISTANI

Are you kidding?  Of course.

EVE

Why would you put a fallout shelter

under a porno shop?

TROY

None of this stuff was here in 1962.

The Valley was mostly small homes and

fruit orchards.

EVE

Well, we've come a long way, haven't

we?  I want to go home.

TROY

Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

TROY

Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a

message. And if you want to leave a

number don't say it fast! I hate that!

Say it slow. Thank you.

ADAM

Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just

wanted to thank you for everything you

did for me...and I wanted to tell you

that I...uh...that I wish so many good

things for you. I wish so hard that

all of your dreams come true. Um...I,

uh...

EVE

Adam!!

TROY

Where?!

EVE

Stop!

EVE

Adam!!

HELEN

How long will you set it for this

time?

CALVIN

I thought ten years.

HELEN

Well, that's...considerably shorter

than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,

why set the locks at all.  I mean the

radiation is gone and...

CALVIN

To keep what's up there from getting

down here! It's not the radiation I'm

worried about.

ADAM (OC)

Mom?  Dad?

ADAM

I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve

Rustokov.

EVE

(stepping forward, offering

her hand)

How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.

Webber?

WEBBERS

(rather dumb-struck)

Hello.

EVE

Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful

things about you.

HELEN

Well, please excuse us!  We...we

haven't entertained a guest in...um...

CALVIN

Some time.

HELEN

What can I offer you, Eve?

ADAM

Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

HELEN

What?

ADAM

I can't explain it now.  But I want

you to set the locks for two months.

You have more than enough of

everything.  Then we'll be back to get

you.

CALVIN

But, I don't understand.

ADAM

And, I'm asking you to trust me

without understanding why.

CALVIN

Well, in that case...of course, son.

HELEN

Of course.

EVE

They are wonderful parents.

ADAM

We have to go.

HELEN

No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

CALVIN

Yes, please! You must.

ADAM/EVE

Well...sure...okay.

EVE

Adam said I shouldn't mention the

Communists.

HELEN

Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the

Communists!

HELEN

Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but

are you and Adam...um...dating?

EVE

Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.

(then)

I'm also from Pasadena.

CALVIN

A toast! To Adam and Eve!

EVE

(gagging)

What is this sh...stuff?!

CALVIN

Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know

how good it is heated up.

EVE

You know, they don't, do they?

EVE (cont'd)

What about grace?

HELEN

Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!

(then)

I like your friend, Adam.

EVE (VO)

And you thought your parents were

weird.

BROKER

It's like the Garden of Eden, don't

you think?

EVE (VO)

You see, that night, Adam had a choice

between me and his parents.

EVE (VO)

It's truly amazing what you can get

done when you have unlimited funds.

Did you know you can have whole houses

built in just a matter of months. All

you have to say is this..."I don't

care what it costs."  And then, of

course, you've got

to really mean it, which no one ever

does.

ADAM

That lamp is perfect!

STORE OWNER

(very faggy)

I'm holding that for Elton John.

TROY

(faggy right back)

Oh, I think not.

ADAM

Eve, I've got to go back! My parents

can't handle this up here. And there

was no bomb, was there?

EVE

No.

ADAM

See! I can't tell them that!  I can't

ever let them know. It makes their

life..well, frankly...

a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You

understand?

EVE

We can make this work, Adam! Believe

me! I'm very good at making things

work!

ADAM

My mother's like that.

EVE (VO)

It took a while to convince Archbishop

Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he

was pretty broken up about it, too,

until I showed him my plans for Los

Angeles' hottest and most original

night spot.

EVE

You'll be a ten percent partner and

still retain ownership of the

entrance.

SODA JERK

Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real

one.

EVE (VO)

Our idea was to bring Adam's parents

up to the surface very slowly.  Make

them very comfortable and then break

the bad news to them that there was no

nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't

kill them Adam's going to tell his

father about the Internet.

ADAM

You put the tape in here and you get a

movie -- in your own home.

EVE/TROY

No!!

HELEN

This is your bedroom?

ADAM

No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's

office.

HELEN

Well, where are you --

ADAM

Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

HELEN

No.

ADAM

Yes.

EVE

Is that all right?

HELEN

It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

HELEN (cont'd)

Calvin!  They're married!

CALVIN

(offering his hand to both)

That's wonderful. We Webber guys have

mighty good luck when it comes to

women.

CALVIN (cont'd)

What's that thing?

ADAM

It's kind of a combination television-

typewriter-telephone-post office type

of thing.

(leading Calvin out)

I'll show it to you later.

CALVIN

This is great son, just great. By the

way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,

that's not Russian, is it?

ADAM

It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents

immigrated here.

CALVIN

Uh-huh.

ADAM

Dad, I don't know how to tell you

this. And I was going to wait a while,

but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.

A plane crashed into our backyard. I

looked it up in old newspapers.

CALVIN

(after a while)

You're sure?

ADAM

Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed

without a shot being fired. The Cold

War is over.

CALVIN

That's what everybody believes?

ADAM

Yes, sir. It's true.

CALVIN

What? Did the politburo just one day

say - "We give up?"

ADAM

Yes. That's kind of how it was.

CALVIN

Uh-huh.

CALVIN

My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!

You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we

didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our

evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor

us!"  I bet they've even asked the

West for aid!  Right?!

ADAM

Uh, I think they have.

CALVIN

Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly

dissemblers! Those, uh...

(he can't think of another

description, so he moves on)

They've finally pulled the wool over

everybody's eyes!

EVE (VO)

Have you ever in your life seen a son

who did more for his parents?

EVE (VO)

Adam says that this is simply how

things work.  First the parents take

care of the children and then the

children take care

of the parents. He says historically,

that's how it works.

EVE (VO)

Whenever Adam gives me such obviously

incorrect information, I just smile,

slap him on the knee, and look out the

window.

Why spoil his dreams?  They're such

wonderful dreams.

FADE OUT:

THE END
