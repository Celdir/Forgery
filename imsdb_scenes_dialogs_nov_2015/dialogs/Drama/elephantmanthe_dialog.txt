#1 DAUGHTER

Poppa!

#2 DAUGHTER

Poppa... may we go in there?

ANNE

Alright... Your turn.

#2 DAUGHTER

Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants!

ANNE

Oh, elephants! We'll go see them.

ANNE

(to Treves)

You won't be long?

TREVES

I'll join you shortly.

OLDER MAN

A wicked birth...

BARKER

Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are

larger than this mammoth blacksmith's

bellows. So great is his power of

exhalation, rivaling even that of

the Great North Wind, that he will

now challenge two grown men to attempt

to hold the bellows shut as he applies

the mighty blast of his herculean

breath! Are there any volunteers?

BARKER

Ah! I see two likely lads! Come

forward! Come forward! Pit your

strength against the Mighty Wind-

Man!

BARKER

Gentlemen... Are you ready?

THE LADS

Yes we are... Right... etc.

BARKER

Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the

demonstration begin!!

BARKER

Ladies and Gentlemen!... "THE

INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!

BOBBIES

Make way! Make way!

WOMAN (V.O.)

Oh yes they are, they're yours

alright.

SKELETON MAN

I refuse to believe it! I will not

accept it! Those babies are simply

too ugly, they cannot be mine!

SKELETON MAN

I don't want them! Get rid of them!

I don't want to see them!

FAT LADY

Darling, don't be difficult! Let's

take our sweet lovely children on an

outing.

SKELETON MAN

We'll take these miserable whelps on

an outing, alright! We'll take them

to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY!

FAT LADY

(pausing at the screams)

Children save yourselves! Prevail

upon your Pappa!

DWARVES

Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!

FATHER

(out loud, to no one

in particular)

This is too much! They should not

allow it! They should not allow it!

WOMAN

Beast, Beast...

BOBBY

No! That's right out! Drop the

curtain!

OWNER

You can't do that! I've got my rights!

ALDERMAN

I have the authority to close you

down, and I'm doing just that!

ALDERMAN

This exhibit degrades all who see

it, as well as the poor creature

himself.

OWNER

He's a freak! How else can he live?

ALDERMAN

Freaks are one thing. No one objects

to freaks, but this is entirely

different. This is monstrous, and

ought not to be allowed. These

officers will see to it that you are

on your way as soon as possible.

Good day.

OWNER

(to himself)

...Movin' again!

OWNER

Have a care, guv'nor.

TREVES

Forgive me...

FADE TO BLACK:

TREVES

How long has this man been here?

FOX

Three quarters of an hour.

TREVES

Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer.

Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope

please. It's a machine accident. I

expect you'll be seeing a good deal

of this.

TREVES

(off handedly)

Abominable things these machines.

One can't reason with them.

FOX

What a mess.

TREVES

What got you into medicine, Hodges?

HODGES

My father, sir. He's built quite a

successful practice. I hope to take

it over one day.

TREVES

Is that your case as well, Pierce?

PIERCE

Yes sir. Though of course I do have

a great desire to help my fellowman.

TREVES

Of course you do realize that medicine

has changed quite a bit since your

father's time. In those days we didn't

even wash our coats. In fact, the

sign of a truly accomplished surgeon--

was his black operating coat, so

stiff with dried blood and pus that

it could stand up by itself in the

corner. I've still got mine

upstairs... You don't mind blood, do

you?

HODGES & PIERCE

Oh no, sir. (etc.)

TREVES

Good, that's one thing we've always

plenty of.

BOY

Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.

TREVES

Yes?

BOY

I found it.

TREVES

(studying the Boy

carefully)

Did you see it?

TREVES

I'll be with you in a moment ...

FOX

(quietly)

I say Freddie, what are you about?

TREVES

Oh nothing... nothing of any great

importance.

TREVES

Do you know where the proprietor is?

OWNER

He's not a peeler...

BOY

No, I don't think so.

OWNER

No... I don't think so.

TREVES

Are you the proprietor?

OWNER

And who might you be, sir?

TREVES

Just one of the curious. I'd like to

see it.

OWNER

I don't think so. No sir, we're

closed.

TREVES

I'd pay handsomely for a private

showing. Are you the proprietor?

OWNER

Handsomely?... Who sent you?

TREVES

Pardon me?

OWNER

Never mind. I'm the owner.

OWNER

Here we are sir.

(ticking it off by

rote)

Life is full of surprises. Ladies

and gentlemen, consider the fate of

this creature's poor mother. In the

fourth month of her maternal

condition, she was struck down by a

wild elephant

(leering)

Struck down, if you take my meaning,

on an uncharted African isle. The

result is plain to see ladies and

gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT

MAN!

OWNER

Stand up!

BOY

Stand up!

OWNER

Turn around!

BOY

Turn around! Turn around!

TREVES

So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow,

10:00 a.m.? Mr...?

OWNER

Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.

TREVES

I'll send a cab. Here is my card.

OWNER

Now we got a deal... We understand

each other... guv. We understand

each other completely.

OWNER

Don't just stand there. Help him up.

CABMAN

Not at all, sir. My... pleasure.

TREVES

I'll be in my rooms, Mothershead.

I'm not to be disturbed.

TREVES

Come with me, please.

MATRON

You heard the doctor... Go on.

TREVES

My name is Frederick Treves... I am

a surgeon here at the London Hospital,

and I lecture in anatomy at the

Medical College... I would very much

like to examine you. Would that be

all right?

TREVES

Ah... yes. Um, first I would like to

ask you a few questions, would that

be all right?

TREVES

Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner...

um, the man who... who looks after

you tells me that you are English

and your name is John Merrick. Is

that correct?

TREVES

Do you know where you were born?

Where you come from?

TREVES

I tell you what, I'll ask you a

question, and you shake your head

like this for "no" and nod like this

for "yes", alright? Do you understand?

TREVES

Are you in any pain?

TREVES

Um, no. Just nod your head like this

for "yes" and shake it like this for

"no". Now, are you in any pain?

TREVES

Are your parents still alive?

TREVES

Do you understand? Are they dead?

Your father... your mother?

FOX

Freddie, what you doing for... I say

do open a window in here or...

FOX

Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, I had no

idea that... I say!

FOX

Good Lord, Freddie! What have you

got in there?

TREVES

You'll know presently. At the meeting

of the society. But until then, I

beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

FOX

Certainly, if you insist. You must

have quite a find there.

TREVES

I don't know what I've got.

FOX

Nothing of any importance, eh?

TREVES

I'll tell you this much, Fox, it's

beyond anything you or I have ever

dealt with. Keep it to yourself,

please.

TREVES

Come sit down.

TREVES

Sit... down.

TREVES

I think I'll examine you now. I'll

save the questions for later... Will

you take off your hat now, please?

TREVES

Don't be frightened, I simply want

to look at you. Do you understand?

TREVES

(more to himself)

That's right, don't be frightened.

Don't be frightened.

TREVES

Are you ready?

TREVES

Go ahead.

TREVES

He is English, he is twenty-one years

of age and his name is John Merrick.

Gentlemen, in the course of my

profession I have come upon lamentable

deformities of the face due to injury

or disease, as well as mutilations

and contortions of the body, depending

upon like causes; but, at no time

have I met with such a dreaded or

perverted version of a human being

as this man. I wish to draw your

attention to the insidious conditions

affecting this patient. Note, if you

will, the extreme enlargement of the

skull... and upper limb, which is

totally useless. The alarming

curvature of the spine... Turn him,

please... the looseness of the skin,

and the varying fibrous tumors that

cover 90% of the body.

TREVES

...And there is every indication

that these afflictions have been in

existence, and have progressed

rapidly, since birth. The Patient

also suffers from chronic bronchitis.

As an interesting side-note, in spite

of the afore-mentioned anomalies,

the patient's genitals remain entirely

intact and unaffected.

TREVES

So then, gentlemen, owing to this

series of deformities: The congenital

exostoses of the skull; extensive

papillomatous growths and large

pendulous masses in connection with

the skin; the great enlargement of

the right upper limb, involving all

the bones; the massive distortion of

the head and the extensive areas

covered by papillomatous growth, the

patient has been called, "The Elephant

Man."

TREVES

Hmm?

TREVES

Hmm?

TREVES

It's been a long day for everyone.

TREVES

Oh, yes, you'll need a cab...

(to the E.M.)

Stay.

TREVES

Come with me.

FOX

You never mentioned his mental state.

TREVES

He's imbecile, no doubt from birth.

He speaks, but... it's all gibberish.

No, the man's a homeless idiot...

(to himself)

I pray God he's an idiot.

THE FIRST

Quite a coup, Freddie. You'll look

splendid in the journal.

THE SECOND

Where ever did you find that creature?

THE THIRD (V.O.)

It's a pity.

FOX (V.O.)

I pity the poor cab driver, myself.

ANNE

Did it go well, darling?

TREVES

Yes, very well, I think. Are the

girls in bed?

ANNE

Yes, and they send their kisses.

Would you like your sherry now?

TREVES

No, I think a whiskey.

BYTES

Belt up, you misbegotten garbage.

(mumbling to himself)

How can I eat with that?

BYTES

(yelling)

How can I eat with THAT?

BYTES

Out of my sight!

BYTES

(not satisfied with

his speed)

NOW!

BYTES

You clumsy sod!

BYTES

YOU!

BOY

Bytes! DON'T...

BYTES

This won't do, my lad. This just

won't do!

BOY

Our man is sick. Come right away.

TREVES

What is it?

BOY

Like this.

(he breathes heavily

in and out to

demonstrate the E.M.'s

difficulty)

TREVES

I'll get my bag.

BYTES

What did you do to him? He's been

like this all night!

TREVES

What do you mean?

BYTES

He was fine when he left here, and

now look at him.

TREVES

I intend to.

TREVES

What happened?

BYTES

He fell.

(guardedly)

He falls.

TREVES

He must have taken quite a fall.

BYTES

He's a clumsy git. Never watches

where he is going.

TREVES

Why is he sitting up like this? He

needs rest.

BYTES

That's the way he sleeps. If he lays

down, he'll die.

(he points to his

neck and leans his

head back)

Head's too heavy.

TREVES

This man belongs in hospital.

BYTES

(apprehensively)

Can't you fix him up here? ...He's

my livelihood. Listen.

TREVES

You listen, you're not going to have

much of a livelihood if this man

dies. He's got the rale, he's very

weak, and I don't know how much damage

has been done by his "fall". Now

stop wasting time and fetch a cab.

BYTES

I really appreciate this, guv. You

know, there's lot of things that I

can do for you. I move in the proper

circles, for this type of thing...

(motioning toward the

E.M.)

In fact, anything at all, if you

take my meaning.

BYTES

I like doing business with you. You

and I understand each other,

completely. I know I can trust you.

Can't I?

TREVES

(gazing at him levelly)

Everything will be seen to.

MOTHERSHEAD

(startling Nora)

Nora! Mind your duties... if you

don't concentrate dear, you'll only

make more work for the rest of us.

Now, get about your business.

(pauses, seeing Nora's

collar)

...and do get your collar straight,

dear.

NORA

(fumbling with her

collar)

I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mothershead.

MOTHERSHEAD

Do get on with it, Nora.

TREVES

I don't know if you will understand

this, but you will never go back to

that man again. You're safe now. No

one will ever harm you. Do you

understand?

NURSE

Breakfasting with the patients this

morning, Mr. Treves?

TREVES

It's for a patient.

CARR

Mr. Treves, come over here a moment,

won't you?

CARR

Good morning, Treves.

TREVES

Good morning, sir.

CARR

(seeing the bowl)

You've acquired a taste for this?

TREVES

It's quite nutritious, sir.

CARR

Don't be mad. This muck can kill

you.

CARR

Take this up, to to the man in the

isolation ward when you have a moment,

won't you?

NORA

(apprehensively)

Yes, sir.

TREVES

Don't be frightened. He won't hurt

you.

CARR

Indeed!

CARR

A hospital is no place for secrecy,

Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded

figures about are liable to cause

comment. Why wasn't this patient

properly admitted, and why is he in

isolation? Is he contagious?

TREVES

No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's

been badly beaten.

CARR

Why isn't he in the General Ward,

then?

TREVES

Well sir, he's quite seriously

deformed, and I fear the other

patients would find him... rather

shocking.

CARR

Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to

assume that he is ultimately

incurable?

TREVES

Yes sir.

CARR

What are your plans then, Treves...

You are aware that the London does

not accept incurables. The rules are

quite clear on that point.

TREVES

Yes, I'm well aware of that. But

this case is quite exceptional.

CARR

Oh, is he a friend of yours?

TREVES

No, more of an acquaintance.

CARR

I certainly sympathize with your

problem, Treves... Why don't you try

the British Home, or the Royal

Hospital for perhaps they would have

a place for him.

TREVES

Yes sir, I'll look into that.

(he rises)

Would you like to meet him sir?

TREVES

Excuse me, sir.

CARR

The Elephant Man?

TREVES

I'm sorry, my dear, I should have

warned you. I'm so terribly sorry,

please forgive me. There, you're

alright now. Go downstairs and please

ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up.

Tell her to knock on the door and

wait for me. Alright?

NORA

Yes Sir. I'm sorry, Sir.

TREVES

I'm very sorry about that. Are you

resting well?

TREVES

Ah good. Well then... oh yes, we'll

have to get you some more food. I'm

sure you must be simply famished.

Hmm?

TREVES

Of course you are. Now then, I think

you'll be quite comfortable up here

for awhile. I'll see to it you have

everything you need, and, uh... yes.

OTHER NURSES

Did you see him?

NORA

Yes.

OTHER NURSES

What's wrong with him?

TREVES

Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling

today?

MOTHERSHEAD

(suspiciously)

Fine.

TREVES

Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs.

Mothershead, I want you to come into

this room with me. Inside there is a

man with a rather... unfortunate

appearance.

MOTHERSHEAD

I've heard.

TREVES

Yes... Well, I want you to clear up

a little mess, a breakfast tray was

spilt. And bring up another breakfast.

When you've done that, you and I

shall give the man a bath. But,

Mothershead, I'm counting on your

many years of experience to get you

through this, Above all, do not

scream, do not cry out, or in any

way show this man that you are

frightened of him...

MOTHERSHEAD

Sir, you don't have to worry about

me. I'm not the sort to cry out.

Shall we go in?

TREVES

Yes... Yes, let's go in.

TREVES

(to the E.M., hereafter

Merrick)

I would like you to meet Mrs.

Mothershead - Mrs. Mothershead, Mr.

John Merrick.

MOTHERSHEAD

How do you do?

TREVES

The disease is shocking.

TREVES

I wonder how far it can go before

it...

MOTHERSHEAD

Sit still. Don't wiggle about like a

pup. I won't stand for any

foolishness.

TREVES (V.O.)

It's pretty certain that if he had

the disease as a child, he was

abandoned. But in that case, he'd

have to have had care. The very fact

that he's alive bears that out...

(cut to Treves)

But, where?

MOTHERSHEAD

The workhouse.

TREVES

Yes! The workhouse!

TREVES

(softly)

The workhouse.

NIGHT PORTER

What's all this, then?

YOUNG PORTER

Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant

Man.

NIGHT PORTER

Elephant Man?

YOUNG PORTER

Yeah... I hear it's a real horror.

Even made Mothershead scream.

NIGHT PORTER

Friend of the night, eh? The Elephant

Man. I think I'll have me a look at

that.

NIGHT PORTER

Now, you need the scrubbing, ducks!

CUT TO:

NIGHT PORTER

Hush, love, I told you before one

word from me, they'll toss you back

on the street, and then those pretty

little arms of yours will never grow

straight. Now close your eyes.

NIGHT PORTER

Here he is, the old fiend of the

night, the terror of the London.

Let's have a look at you. Let's see

what makes 'em scream...

NIGHT PORTER

Cor Blimey!

NIGHT PORTER

So this is the Elephant Man. I ain't

never seen nothing like you before.

What the bleedin' hell happened to

you?

NIGHT PORTER

Oh... dumb, eh?

NIGHT PORTER

Good. I likes people what can keep

quiet.

NIGHT PORTER

Like a drink? Go on... Go on have

some. No? You should try being more

sociable, mate.

NIGHT PORTER

(grinning)

You and I are going to be good

friends, we are. And, I've got lots

of friends who I know would like to

meet you. And they will, mate...

they will.

NIGHT PORTER

Welcome to the London.

MILKMAN

Here early again, eh Mr. Treves? If

you don't mind my saying so, sir,

with your early habits, you'd 'a

made a fine milkman.

TREVES

Good morning, Charley. I'll keep

that in mind!

TREVES

Mr. Merrick?

TREVES

....Good morning... John. I've brought

your breakfast.

TREVES

What are you doing down there? Come

up John, come up on the bed. The

cold floor is bad for you. I won't

hurt you, come on now...

TREVES

You must eat. We must keep your

strength...

TREVES

...What on earth is the matter with

you?

TREVES

Now please, John, you must do as I

say. Come up from there.

MOTHERSHEAD

Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be

his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?

TREVES

Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead.

There seems to be some difficulty

this morning.

MOTHERSHEAD

Won't come out, eh?

TREVES

No, he's very upset about something.

MOTHERSHEAD

Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle

it.

MOTHERSHEAD

Alright, my son, none of this fuss.

Come up from there, this instant.

TREVES

No! Don't pull at him like that. We

don't want to frighten him more than

he already is.

MOTHERSHEAD

Honestly, sir, you must be very firm

with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay

about on the floor gibbering all day

long. All he understands is a good

smack.

TREVES

He's had his share of "smacks",

Mothershead. I expect that's what

drives him under the bed. We must

use patience and understanding with

this man.

MOTHERSHEAD

Perhaps you've got the time for that,

Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've

got an entire hospital to look after,

and you have your real patients.

Don't waste your time with him sir,

it's like talking to a wall. I don't

mean to be harsh, but truthfully

what can you do for him? I'll be

back later for his bath. And Mr.

Carr Gomm would like to see you when

you have a moment. Good day sir.

TREVES

(to himself)

What good am I to you...?

TREVES

...What is my purpose? ...It's so

important that I understand you. I

want to help you, I want to be your

doctor...

(directly to Merrick)

but I can't help you unless you help

me, unless I know what you are

feeling. I believe there's something

back there, there's something you

want to say, but I've got to

understand you. Do you understand

me?

TREVES

No! You are going to talk to me! We

are going to show them! We're going

to show them that you're not a wall.

We are going to talk! Do you

understand? Nod your head if you

understand me!

TREVES

You do understand me! You understand.

Now you're going to say it. I've got

to hear how you say things. Now,

very slowly, say "yes."

TREVES

"Yes."

MERRICK

Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.

TREVES

(grabbing Merrick's

arm)

Yes John!

MERRICK

...Yyes

TREVES

Yyyess.

MERRICK

Yyess.

TREVES

That's much better. I could understand

that "yes".

MERRICK

(pleased)

Yes!

TREVES

Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm

going to say some things to you and

I want you to repeat them... um... I

want you to say them back to me. Do

you understand? I'm going to say

some things to you and I want you to

say them back to me. Do you

understand?

MERRICK

Yes.

TREVES

Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"

MERRICK

Hello...

TREVES

My name is...

MERRICK

My... name is...

TREVES

John Merrick.

MERRICK

John... Merrick

TREVES

Say "Merrick".

MERRICK

Merrick...

TREVES

Say "Mmmerrick."

MERRICK

Mmmerrick.

TREVES

Say "Mmmerrick."

MERRICK

Mmmerrick.

TREVES

Well, that's alright. I understand

you. Now, say the whole thing again,

Hello ...

MERRICK

(haltingly)

Hello... my name is... John Merrick.

NORA

Oh, Mrs. Mothershead, please forgive

my behavior yesterday. I'm sorry if

you're having to do extra work on my

account. It was just seeing it...

MOTHERSHEAD

Patients here are not "its". They

are either "he's" or "she's", but

that's alright, Ireland. This one's

going to be more work for all of us.

Good God girl! Mind your broth.

TREVES

Come in.

TREVES

Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how

good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick,

will you please introduce yourself?

MERRICK

(hesitantly)

Hello, my name is John Merrick.

MOTHERSHEAD

Good Lord, Mr. Treves!

TREVES

(exuberantly)

We've made tremendous strides today,

Mothershead. He listens and repeats

with great attention, and this

certainly isn't easy for him.

MOTHERSHEAD

Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves.

It's all very nice, but I don't see

the point. You know they won't let

him stay here.

TREVES

(lowering his voice)

I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a

good impression on the hospital

committee they'd see that he's the

exception to their rule. Now I'm not

expecting miracles. I'm not saying

he'll be able to read or write, but

I do think that I can get him to

speak for himself. I'm going to

arrange things with Carr Gomm right

now.

(to Merrick)

That was very good, John, very good.

That's all for today. We shall do

some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

TREVES

I'll see you soon.

CUT TO:

CARR (V.O.)

Ah, Treves...

CARR

Have you contacted the British Home

and the Royal Hospital?

TREVES

Ah, no sir. I had planned to see

them in the morning.

CARR

Good! How is the patient?

TREVES

He's doing very well. In fact that's

why I came to see you. I think that

if I were to present Mr. Merrick to

the hospital committee, then they

would have a chance to see for

themselves not only the extraordinary

nature of the disease, but of the

man as well. If the committee had a

chance to speak with him, hear him

say a few words for himself, I'm

sure they would see him as a patient,

rather than as a violation of the

rules.

CARR

A few words? I thought he was

imbecile?

TREVES

Well sir, perhaps I should explain...

CARR

I really don't think that's necessary

Treves. I'm quite sure the committee

will be able to make an equitable

decision on the merits of the case,

such as they are.

TREVES

I don't agree. No one can make a

reasonable decision about this man's

future without at least meeting him.

No doctor would presume to diagnose

a patient he had never met.

CARR

No, Treves, it's out of the question.

Now if it was up to me, I'd say

"Certainly, let's meet the fellow,

by all means," I'm sorry, I simply

can't speak for the other members of

the committee.

TREVES

Then will you meet him, as a

representative of the committee.

CARR

Mr. Treves, it's out of the question.

I want to hear as soon as possible

what the other hospitals can do. I'm

sorry.

BYTES

I want my man back.

TREVES

Just a moment, how did you get in

here?

BYTES

Never mind that, I want my man!

TREVES

He's still very sick. Please come

downstairs with me. I'll explain the

situation.

BYTES

(shouting)

DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've

had plenty of time to fix him up,

and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do

you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves.

We had a bargain!

TREVES

You misunderstood. This man suffered

a severe fall, if you take my meaning.

He's my patient now and I must do

what...

BYTES

Pull the other one, why don't you!

We made a deal!

TREVES

I know what you've done to him and

he's never going back to that.

BYTES

He's a freak! That's how they live.

We're partners, him and I, business

partners. You're willfully deprivin'

me of my livlihood!

TREVES

All you do is profit from another

man's misery!

BYTES

You think you're better 'n me? YOU

wanted the freak to show all your

doctor chums and make a name for

yourself, you guv. So I gave him to

you. On trust, in the name of science!

And now I want him back.

TREVES

You don't own this man!

BYTES

I want him back!

TREVES

So you can beat him? So you can starve

him? A dog in the street would fare

better with you!

BYTES

I've got my rights, damn you, and

I'm going to the authorities!

CARR (V.O.)

Well, go to the authorities...

CARR

By all means do so. In fact, I'll

fetch them myself. I'm quite sure

they'd be very interested in your

story, as well as ours.

TREVES

Now I think we really do understand

one another.

BYTES

(venomously)

Right... Right.

CARR

Singularly unpleasant chap... uh...

I don't suppose there would be any

harm in my meeting your... patient,

Mr. Treves.

TREVES

(gratefully)

Thank you very much Sir. Shall we

say in a few days then?

CARR

Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow

afternoon?

TREVES

(slightly taken aback)

Wh... whatever is most convenient

for you, sir.

CARR

Two o'clock then... you know Treves...

It seems this acquaintance of yours

has become rather more than just an

acquaintance.

TREVES

...Yes, Sir.

TREVES

(muttering)

Two o'clock?

CARR

(mumbling out loud)

Elephant Man? I don't want to meet

an Elephant Man.

ANNE

(coyly)

Freddie?

ANNE

Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so

discouraged.

TREVES

I shouldn't be. We made great progress

today. I taught him to repeat a few

basic phrases. He did rather well,

too, but I had to lead him every

step of the way. Though frankly, at

times I was unsure of who was leading

whom.

ANNE

What do you mean?

TREVES

Well, I wasn't sure whether he was

parroting me because that's all he

was capable of, or whether he sensed

that that's all I wanted to hear,

and he was trying to please me.

ANNE

But I thought you said that he was

rather... simple?

TREVES

He is. I mean, I've always thought

he was. I think he must be. Is he

simple? Or is that just something

I've wished upon him to make things

simpler for myself?

ANNE

Frederick, why are you so interested

in this particular case?

TREVES

I don't know. I can't explain it. If

this is an intelligent man, trapped

in the body of a monster, then I'm

under a moral obligation to help

free that mind, free that spirit as

best I can, to help him live as full

and content a life as possible. But!

If he's an imbecile, who's body I

can't treat and who's mind I can't

touch, well, then my obligation is

discharged. They can put him where

they will; he won't be bothered, I

won't be bothered, and everyone's

conscience can remain free and

untroubled. And that is my dilemma...

what is in his mind?

ANNE

Perhaps you're just polishing a stone,

endowing this Elephant Man with

qualities he doesn't possess?

TREVES

(impatiently)

And what qualities are those?

Intelligence or stupidity?

ANNE

(slightly hurt)

I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

TREVES

I'm sorry... I don't know either. I

just don't know.

ANNE

Well, these things take time.

TREVES

I've only got until two o'clock

tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm

meets him. Somehow, between now and

then I've got to make John Merrick

at least seem like an intelligent

man... Why am I fooling myself?

Nothing short of John delivering the

Sermon on the Mount is going to sway

Carr Gomm...

MERRICK (V.O.)

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

want, he maketh me to lie down in

green pastures; He leadeth me beside

still waters. He restoreth my soul:

He Guideth me in the paths of

righteousness...

TREVES

Righteousness...

MERRICK (V.O.)

Righteousness for his namesake.

TREVES

Very good, very good. Now, when your

visitor comes today I want you to

say it exactly the way you said it

just now. I will introduce him to

you and you will say the words you've

learned. If you have any trouble

with any of the words, I'll help

you. I'm sure you'll be just fine.

If you do as well for him as you've

done for me these last two days,

then I'm sure our visitor will be

very pleased. Now, let's go through

the whole thing again, shall we? I

will say "May I introduce you to Mr.

Carr Gomm." And you will say...

MERRICK

Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am

very pleased to meet you!

TREVES

It's only a physical problem. He has

trouble with certain sounds because

of the constrictive deformity of the

mouth. But he can talk, and has a

great eagerness to make contact with

people who will let him. So if you

have any difficulty understanding

what he is saying, just tell me and

I'll make it clear.

CARR

Speaking is one thing, Treves, but

can the man comprehend?

TREVES

...As I said, it's only a physical

problem... but I do feel that Mr.

Merrick is very flattered that you're

taking the time and trouble to meet

him, and he's most anxious to make a

good impression, so he might seem

rather nervous.

CARR

He needn't. I have no desire to cause

him any discomfort. Did you make

those inquiries we spoke about?

TREVES

Yes, I spoke to both the British

Home and Royal Hospital for

Incurables. I'm afraid that they

weren't very encouraging, but they

said they'd bring it up at their

next committee meeting, so we should

have their answers shortly.

CARR

Fine, fine. You know, your dedication

to this patient is an inspiring thing,

Treves. But you must remember that

this is a hospital, and there are

many patients here. Patients who can

be made well, and you owe them your

first consideration. Just don't become

so obsessed, old man, that you begin

to neglect them.

MERRICK

Come in.

TREVES

John, may I introduce you to Sir

Carr Gomm.

MERRICK

Hello... my name is John Merrick. I

am very pleased to meet you.

CARR

I'm very... pleased to meet you.

CARR

How are you feeling today?

MERRICK

I feel much better. Thank you for

asking. And you?

CARR

I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How

is your bronchitis?

MERRICK

I feel much better. Thank you.

CARR

Are you comfortable here?

MERRICK

Everyone has been very kind. I am

extremely grateful.

TREVES

Mr. Merrick likes the food here.

Don't you John?

MERRICK

Oh yes! It is much better than what

I am used to.

CARR

Oh yes?

TREVES

(after a pause)

And what was that, John?

MERRICK

Potatoes...

TREVES

(to Carr Gomm)

...Yes potatoes... but...

MERRICK

But the variety of food here is very

pleasing... I commend you.

CARR

(after a pause)

I understand that you were beaten?

DIERRICK

Oh no, everyone has been very kind.

CARR

No, I meant in your former situation.

MERRICK

I'm feeling much better now...

CARR

Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves?

As a teacher?

MERRICK

...I... everyone has been very kind

to me.

CARR

Of course. How long did you and Mr.

Treves prepare for this interview?

MERRICK

...everyone has been very kind.

CARR

Yes, of course... Well, it's been a

pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

Good day.

TREVES

(to John)

Thank you, John. You did very well.

MERRICK

(his voice is gaining

strength)

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

want. He maketh me to lie down in

green pastures...

(he continues through

the following dialogue)

CARR

It was a nice try, Treves, but the

man is so obviously mouthing your

words.

TREVES

Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted

your time, sir. I just felt that I

had to do anything I could to protect

him.

CARR

I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't

belong here. He's be much happier

somewhere else, where he could be

constantly looked after. Believe me,

Frederick, it's better that it worked

out this way. Good day.

MERRICK (V.O.)

(now full voice)

Yea, though I walk through the valley

of the shadow of death, I will fear

no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy

rod and Thy staff, they comfort me...

CARR

What is it, Treves?

MERRICK (V.O.)

Thou preparest a table before me in

the presence of mine enemies, Thou

anointest my head with oil...

TREVES

I didn't teach him that part!

MERRICK

My cup runneth over. Surely goodness

and loving kindness shall follow me

all the days of my life, and I shall

dwell in the house of the Lord

forever.

TREVES

How did you, know the rest? I never

taught you the rest of it.

CARR

I don't understand.

TREVES

Tell me, John, how did you know the

rest of the 23rd Psalm?

MERRICK

(hesitantly)

I... I used to read the Bible every

day. I know it very well. The Bible,

and the Book of Common Prayer. The

23rd Psalm is very beautiful.

CARR (V.O.)

It was a great pleasure to meet you,

Mr. Merrick.

MERRICK

I am very pleased to meet you.

CARR

I hope we can talk together again

sometime. Good day.

TREVES

(to Merrick)

I'll be right back.

CARR

I want to see you in my office as

soon as you're through up here. We've

a good deal to discuss.

TREVES

Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you

very much.

CARR

Treves. Well done.

TREVES

Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded

in spite of my shortsightedness.

TREVES

Why did you let me go on like that,

teaching you what you already knew?

Why didn't you tell me you could

read?

MERRICK

You did not ask me.

TREVES

I never thought to ask. How can you

ever forgive me?

MERRICK

Oh, no do not say that. You have

been so kind to me. I was afraid to

say too much. People always want me

to be quiet. You wanted me to speak,

but I was afraid. Forgive me.

TREVES

We do have a lot to talk about, don't

we?

CARR

Can you imagine what his life has

been like?

TREVES

Yes, I think I can.

CARR

No you can't. You can't begin to

know, no one can.

CARR

You are quite right, Treves, this is

an exceptional case. And I quite

agree that the committee should see

Mr. Merrick.

TREVES

I could easily arrange...

CARR

No, not that way. Broadneck and the

others don't like to deal with

patients directly. It makes them

queasy... Do you have any photographs

of Mr. Merrick?

TREVES

Well, yes.

CARR

Excellent. We shall present them,

along with the other particulars of

the case to the committee. I want

them to see, exactly, how horribly

his body has been affected. You and

I shall vouch for his inner qualities.

TREVES

Do you think they'll go along with

us?

CARR

Of course they will. They're

reasonable men.

MOTHERSHEAD

Read it.

MERRICK

Thou heardest my voice; hide not

thine ear at my breathing, At my

cry.

MOTHERSHEAD

Credit where credit is due. You'll

have the paper every morning at

breakfast.

NIGHT PORTER

I hear you have some trouble

sleepin'...

NIGHT PORTER

Head's too heavy, eh?

NIGHT PORTER

And I heard a nasty rumor about you;

I heard you can talk but you can't,

can you... can you... can you?...

MERRICK

(struggling)

Noooo!

NIGHT PORTER

No... No you can't! One word about

me out of that stinking cakehole...

Just ONE word, and you'll have no

trouble at sleepin'... no trouble at

all. You understand me? Do you!!

MERRICK

(croaking)

Yyyesss.

NIGHT PORTER

There now, that's better, i'n' it?

CARR

As far as I can see, the only obstacle

might be Broadneck. He has enormous

influence over the others, very old

school, not an easy man to impress.

In any case, if worse does come to

worse, we still have the British and

Royal Homes to fall back on, don't

we.

CARR

Don't we?

TREVES

No, we don't. Their committees have

informed me that they're unwilling

to take Mr. Merrick, even if they

were supplied with funds. They don't

want him.

CARR

Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?

CARR

Don't worry Treves, we'll make them

see it our way.

CARR

They've eyes, haven't they?

TREVES (V.O.)

...Due to the progressive nature of

the disease, I feel sure that the

patient does not have much longer to

live.

TREVES

Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen,

but there is no other place for him.

Both the Royal Hospital and the

British Home have turned him down

even if sufficient funds for his

care were provided. The workhouse is

certainly out of the question. The

patient has an overwhelming fear of

returning to the horrors of his past.

His appearance is so disturbing that

all shrink from him. He cannot, in

justice to others, be put in the

general ward of the workhouse. The

police rightly prevent his being

exhibited, and he is mobbed in the

streets wherever he goes. What is to

be done with him?

BROADNECK

I, for one, am sick and tired of

this competitive freak-hunting by

these overly ambitious young doctors,

trying to make names for themselves.

To parade then about in front of the

pathological society is one thing,

but to waste this committee's valuable

time with requests for shelter for

these abominations of nature is quite

another.

TREVES

Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an

animal, he is a man, fully aware of

his condition. An intelligent,

sensitive, literate man, with an

intimate knowledge of the Bible. His

horrible infirmities do not reduce

him to anything less than what he

is, a man; and it would be criminal

if we of the London Hospital, his

final refuge, the last place on earth

where this man can find peace, were

to cast him out.

CARR

Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion.

There are two small rooms off Bedstead

Square that are no longer in use and

would be admirably suited to Mr.

Merrick's needs. I also propose to

write a letter to The Times, appealing

to their readers for assistance.

Knowing the generosity of the British

public, I feel we would have little

trouble in raising the funds for his

maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's

rules do preclude the admission of

incurables, but if ever there was an

exception to the rule, it is this

patient. So therefore, I propose, if

Mr. Treves is finished, that we put

it to a vote. All those in favor of

keeping Mr. Merrick here?

BROADNECK

One moment,

(showing the picture

of Merrick)

as far as I'm concerned this creature

has no business being in our hospital.

I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would

be an excellent idea,

(to Carr Gomm)

and when you appeal for funds, I

think you should appeal for a more

appropriate place for him as well. I

agree the British public is generous,

and I'm sure that somewhere the

creature will find a happy and

permanent home, but not here.

CARR

I see. All, then, that move we keep

Mr. Merrick here?

CARR

All those opposed?

CARR

I see.

BROADNECK

(triumphantly)

Well then. In the meantime, of course,

he needn't be turned out. He may

stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square

until such time as more suitable

arrangements can be made, thus freeing

the Isolation Ward for more deserving

patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman,

if there is nothing further to

discuss, I move that we adjourn this

meeting and all go bout our normal

business.

CARR

I second the motion gentlemen. This

meeting is adjourned.

CARR (V.O.)

Somehow I don't think they quite

understand.

WOMAN

...terrible though his appearance

is, so terrible indeed that women

and nervous persons fly in terror

from the sight of him, and that he

is debarred from seeking to earn his

livelihood in any ordinary way, yet

he is superior in intelligence, can

read and write, is quiet, gentle,

not to say even refined in his mind.

WOMAN

I'd very much like to meet that

gentleman. He sounds almost

Shakespearean.

#1 DOCTOR

"...in life until he came under the

kind care of the nursing staff of

the London Hospital and the surgeon

who has befriended him..."

#2 DOCTOR

Good publicity for the Hospital, at

any rate.

#3 DOCTOR

Treves comes off well too, eh Freddie?

#4 DOCTOR

It was pleasant of you to join us

this evening, Frederick.

#2 DOCTOR

Your Elephant Man dining out this

evening?

#4 DOCTOR

I understand the kitchen ran out of

hay this morning.

FOX

(slightly sourly)

Do continue reading, Mr. Stanley,

please.

#1 DOCTOR

"...it is a case of singular

affliction brought about through no

fault of himself; he can but hope

for quiet and privacy during a life

which Mr. Treves assures me is not

likely to be long,"

#4 DOCTOR

The Elephant Man. Makes you sound

rather more like a zoo-keeper than a

surgeon, Frederick.

TREVES

Excuse me gentlemen. I seem to have

lost my appetite. Good evening.

#4 DOCTOR

I say, what's he on about?

#3 DOCTOR

He's getting a bit of a swelled head,

if you ask me.

FOX

(coldly)

Well, no one did ask you Atkins.

Frederick Treves is not only the

most skillful surgical operator here,

he's also a humanitarian of the

highest order. You sound like a pack

of whining school boys with your

petty jealousies.

#3 DOCTOR

Look here, Fox, I simply said.

FOX

Oh belt up!

1ST WOMAN

There are cleaner rooms in the

gasworks.

1ST WOMAN

Who's all the fuss for, then?

2ND WOMAN

(wiping her mouth)

Don't you know? It's for that strange

one.

1ST WOMAN

Mr. Treves' Elephant Man? I hear

he's got a trunk.

2ND WOMAN

Right, right.

2ND WOMAN

Blimey, now we're cleanin' up for

circus animals!

DISSOLVE TO:

MERRICK

(reading softly)

"A silent shaft of stone on a deserted

promontory, the lonely Eddystone is

a beacon of aid and comfort to

mariners of all nations."

TREVES

Good evening. How are you feeling?

MERRICK

Good evening. Very well, thank you.

And you?

TREVES

Very well, thank you. I have something

for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy

it, it's very popular.

MERRICK

(surprised)

Thank you... so much... oh it's

beautiful!

TREVES

I came to tell you that I'll be here

early tomorrow morning. We're moving

you to your permanent home. I'm sure

you'll be very happy there, John. So

get a good night's rest, there'll be

new people to meet tomorrow. Good

night.

MERRICK

(weakly)

Good night.

NIGHT PORTER

Here... listen to this. This is a

letter to THE London Times from the

guvnor of the hospital.

(starts to read)

There is now in a little room off

one of our attic wards a man named

John Merrick, so dreadful a sight

that he is unable even to come out

by daylight to the garden. He has

been called The Elephant Man on

account of his terrible deformity...

NIGHT PORTER

...His appearance is so terrible

that woman and nervous persons fly

in terror at the sight of him.

(pauses)

...and guess who can get you tickets

to see him? Your own Sunny Jim!

YOUNG MAN IN CROWD

Let's go see him, then!

NIGHT PORTER

Keep your shirts on.

(shaking his finger

at them)

...When the time is right. Right now

he's in the attic but tomorrow they're

movin' him into Bedstead Square,

right into my lap... then... for the

right price you'll see something

you'll never see again in your life.

MERRICK

(wheezing)

Workhouse!

TREVES

This is your new home, John.

MERRICK

This... is my new home?

TREVES

Yes.

MERRICK

(incredulous)

The hospital?

TREVES

Of course! What did you think?

MERRICK

(almost sobbing)

How long will I stay here?

TREVES

I promise you. You will never see

the inside of that horrible place

again. You will never, ever go back

to the workhouse... or that man.

It's a splendid room, don't you think?

MERRICK

When I'm next moved may I go to a

lighthouse?... or to a blind-asylum?

TREVES

Has the response picked up?

CARR

Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd

expected. A few small cheques. Well-

wishers. Don't worry, these things

undoubtedly take time.

TREVES

But he's so afraid he's going to be

carted off. I've promised him that

won't happen.

CARR

Well... I'll let you know if there's

something in the afternoon post.

TREVES

Please do.

MOTHERSHEAD

Well, I think I can safely hand the

duties over to you girls now. Mr.

Merrick will require a bath every

day... that way he won't pong quite

so much. Nora, you can instruct

Kathleen on the finer points of Mr.

Merrick's bath. You'll be on your

own tomorrow.

MOTHERSHEAD

Don't look so glum girls. Such

enthusiastic volunteers should be

more cheerful.

MOTHERSHEAD

Oh, and girls, under no circumstances

are there to be any mirrors brought

into this room.

KATHLEEN

He's... so ugly!

NORA

Ugly or not, you're going to help

me.

NORA

Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

MERRICK

Yes.

NORA

You look very nice in your new

clothes.

MERRICK

Thank you very much.

NORA

Well, if there is nothing more, I

suppose we'll be leaving you now.

MERRICK

No, nothing.

TREVES

You look splendid, John.

MERRICK

Thank you very much.

TREVES

When one is invited to tea, one must

look one's best.

CUT TO:

TREVES (V.O.)

Make yourself comfortable, John.

TREVES

Come and meet our quest, my love.

TREVES

John Merrick, I'd like you to meet

my wife, Anne Treves.

ANNE

(smiling)

I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.

Merrick.

MERRICK

I'm very...

TREVES

John... what's the matter? John...

why are you upset?

MERRICK

(sobbing)

I'm not used to such kindness. From

a beautiful woman.

ANNNE

Would you like a nice cup of tea,

Mr. Merrick?

MERRICK

(still sobbing)

Yes... thank you.

TREVES

Yes, a cup of tea would go nicely.

TREVES

John... would you like to see the

rest of the house?

TREVES

Come with me, John. I'll show it to

you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNE

Mr. Merrick, sugar?

MERRICK

Yes please, two.

ANNE

One or two?

MERRICK

Two, please.

TREVES

John loves the house.

ANNE

Do you?

MERRICK

Oh yes. You have so many nice things,

and so much room.

ANNE

Oh?

TREVES

Yes, we do have a lot of room. But

you should see the place on weekends,

when I see patients here. Sometimes

there are so many, we have to set

them down wherever we can. In fact,

Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the

only room she can call her own is

the bedroom.

MERRICK

(earnestly)

Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do

you call that thing above the bed?

TREVES

That's a canopy, John.

MERRICK

Ohhh...

TREVES

How is your tea, John?

MERRICK

It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit

with you very much. It's so very

kind of you to have me as a guest in

your home. I'm sorry I made a

spectacle of myself.

TREVES

Not at all, John.

MERRICK

I love the way you've arranged your

pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that

the way it's done in most houses?

TREVES

Oh yes.

MERRICK

Who are they of?

TREVES

Oh, our relatives... the children.

MERRICK

The children! May I see?

TREVES

Of course.

MERRICK

(as if looking at an

icon)

The Children. Where are your children

TREVES

Oh, they're gone for the day... with

friends.

MERRICK

(the word gives him

pleasure)

Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.

ANNE

And here is one of Frederick's mother.

MERRICK

How lovely.

TREVES

Yes.

ANNE

And here are my mother and father.

MERRICK

They have noble faces.

ANNE

(a cord is struck)

I've always thought that myself.

MERRICK

Oh, yes.

MERRICK

(ever so timidly)

Would you... would you like to see

my mother?

TREVES

(startled)

Your mother?

MERRICK

Here.

ANNE

Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.

MERRICK

She has the face of an angel... She

was an angel. She was so kind... so

kind to me. It's not her fault, for

in the fourth month of her maternal

condition she was knocked down by an

elephant. I'm sure I must have been

a great disappointment to her.

ANNE

(visibly touched)

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as

loving as you are could ever be a

disappointment.

MERRICK

If only I could find her. If only

she could see me now, here, with

such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs.

Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then

maybe she would love me as I am.

I've tried to hard to be good.

MERRICK

Please... please...

NORA

Good morning, Mr. Merrick.

MERRICK

Good morning.

NORA

What is this that you're doing?

NORA

(pointing at the box)

What is it?

NORA

What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips.

Oh, of course. Why... why that's

very good, I mean you've gotten the

windows and arches just right.

MERRICK

Yes.

NORA

But it's so good, I mean... it's so

very good.

MERRICK

Thank you... very much.

NORA

Where did you get this box?

NORA

The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!

MERRICK

I meant no harm, it was the only

place where I could find cardboard.

I thought it has been thrown away.

NORA

It's alright, it was thrown away. No

one wants it. It's just that it's a

little dirty, that's all.

NORA

What's this?

MERRICK

The main spire.

NORA

The... oh, the spire! How silly of

me, it's as plain as day... Mr.

Merrick, where did you learn to do

this?

MERRICK

...I learned a long time ago.

NORA

Oh, but how will you finish it? You

haven't any more cardboard.

MERRICK

I'll have to find some more.

NORA

(uncomfortably)

Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.

MERRICK

Come in.

TREVES

Good morning, John.

MERRICK

Good morning.

TREVES

John, there's someone here who would

like to meet you. Would that be

alright?

TREVES

John, I'd like you to meet one of

the brightest lights of the British

stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal,

John Merrick.

KENDAL

Good day, Mr. Merrick.

MERRICK

Good day...!

KENDAL

I've brought you some things. I hope

you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you

don't think it too forward.

MERRICK

Oh, no.

KENDAL

I knew you'd understand. Here.

KENDAL

I want you to know that I don't go

about giving my pictures to just

anyone.

MERRICK

Oh, no. I would never think it! It's

so beautiful. You are so... I'll

give it a place of honor, here, next

to my mother.

KENDAL

She's very pretty, your mother.

MERRICK

Yes.

MERRICK

Mr. Treves says that you are in the

theatre. Do you live there?

KENDAL

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

MERRICK

Well, even to work there would be

wonderful. Is it beautiful?

KENDAL

You've never been?

MERRICK

Alas, no.

KENDAL

Well you must go. It is one of the

most beautiful places on earth. Of

course, I'm rather partial.

MERRICK

Tell me about it, please!

KENDAL

It's very difficult to put into a

nutshell, but I should say the theater

is the shrine of the imagination,

where one may suspend disbelief and

travel anywhere in the world, to any

time you desire. You may look over

the shoulders of kings, unobserved,

battle with ruthless tyrants, and

marry the beautiful princess, all in

the space of a few hours. Onstage

you may be whoever you wish to be,

do anything you please, and always,

always live happily ever after. The

theatre is all the brightest and

best things of the world, Mr. Merrick.

It is lights and music, gaiety and

joy. It's... well, it's romance.

MERRICK

(the magic word)

Romance!

KENDAL

That's one thing the theatre has in

great store. which reminds me. I

have something else for you...

KENDAL

Have you read it?

MERRICK

No, but I certainly shall.

MERRICK

Romeo and Juliet. I know of this...

"If I profane with my unworthiest

hand, This holy shrine, the gentle

fine is this: My lips, two blushing

pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth

that rough touch with a tender kiss."

KENDAL

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand

too much, Which mannerly devotion

shows in this; For saints have hands

that pilgrims hands do touch, And

palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.

MERRICK

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers

too?

KENDAL

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use

in prayer.

MERRICK

O, then, dear saint, let lips do

what hands do. They pray, grant thou,

lest faith turn to despair.

KENDAL

Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an

Elephant Man at all...

MERRICK

Oh no?

KENDAL

Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.

DISSOLVE TO:

BYTES

So, there you are, my boy, my

treasure.

GIRL

Mummy, listen to this!

MUMMY

Hush, Jennifer, can't you see Mummy's

talking?

GIRL

But it's about Mrs. Kendal, mummy!

The actress you go on so much about!

GIRL

"Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront

of fashion and form, was seen leaving

The London the other afternoon. No,

dear readers, the most facile actress

of our day has not been taken ill,

but rather said she was 'visiting a

friend'. And who was the lucky

recipient of this attention? Quick

enquiries proved it to be none other

than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant

Man, with whom our readers are

undoubtedly familiar. After a chat

of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs.

Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr.

Merrick with an autographed portrait

of herself. Owing to a disfigurement

of the most extreme nature, Mr.

Merrick has never been properly

presented to London society. But

knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal

goes, others inevitably follow, the

questions arises: Will London society

present itself to him?"

WOMAN

(to her driver)

Parkins, whose carriage is that?

DRIVER

Well mum, that looks like Alexander,

Lord Waddington's driver.

WOMAN

Lord and Lady Waddington! Well. Drive

back to the house.

(indicating her

clothing)

I can't be seen in this.

MERRICK

Thank you for your kind gifts. I

can't say enough about this ring.

And this walking stick is ever so

dashing. So much more elegant than

my old one. More tea?

MERRICK

If you have a chill I can close the

window.

THE LADY

Oh no, no, no, I'm fine. Please... I

mean, thank you.

MERRICK

I don't get out as often as I'd like

to, for some people DO find my

appearance disturbing. Of course, I

can't fault them.

MERRICK (V.O.)

People are often frightened by what

they don't understand.

MERRICK (V.O.)

And it is hard to understand, even

for myself, for you see, Mother was

so very beautiful.

MERRICK (V.O.)

How's your tea?

MOTHERSHEAD

(under her breath)

Watery headed bunch.

TREVES

I regret that I must leave you here,

m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much

for coming. It was an act of the

greatest charity.

LADY WADDINGTON

Oh no, Mr. Treves, the pleasure was

all ours. Good day.

TREVES

Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think

John has had enough visitors for one

day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture

at the college, I'll be back this

evening.

MOTHERSHEAD

Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a

word with you.

TREVES

Oh?... Well, quickly please,

Mothershead, I'm overdue.

MOTHERSHEAD

I can't understand why you let those

people go in there, sir.

TREVES

Now Mothershead, you have to

understand that this is very good

for John. He relishes contact with

people outside the hospital...

MOTHERSHEAD

But you saw them, sir. They couldn't

hide their disgust. They don't care

anything for John, they're just trying

to impress their friends.

TREVES

Aren't you being just a little harsh,

Mothershead? You yourself hardly

treated John with much loving kindness

when he first arrived.

MOTHERSHEAD

I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him

and cleaned up after him! If loving

kindness can be called care and

practical concern, then yes, I did

treat him with loving kindness, and

I'm not ashamed to say it.

TREVES

You're right, Mothershead, please

forgive me... Of course, I appreciate

everything you've done for John, and

I'm glad that you are concerned about

his welfare. But, I'm the physician

in charge and I must do what I think

best. I'm also very late, so please

forgive me.

MOTHERSHEAD

If you ask me, sir, he's just being

stared at all over again.

MERRICK

When will the stream be aweary of

flowing under my eye?

When will the wind be aweary of

blowing over the sky?

When will the clouds be aweary of

fleeting?

When will the heart be aweary of

beating, and nature die?

TREVES

Never, oh! Never, nothing will die.

the stream flows the wind blows the

heart beats Nothing will die.

MERRICK

Mr. Treves, there is something I've

been meaning to ask you for some

time...

TREVES

Yes, John?

MERRICK

...Can you cure me?

TREVES

No John, I can't. I can care for

you, but I can't cure you.

MERRICK

I thought as much.

TREVES

John...?

MERRICK

Come in.

TREVES

Are you looking for me, Sister?

NORA

No sir, Mr. Merrick.

(to Merrick)

I have something for you.

NORA

I thought these things would be

helpful with your cathedral.

TREVES

The cathedral is coming along nicely.

MERRICK

(bending over the

model)

Yes, soon I will start the main spire,

but I must finish these columns first,

How kind of her!

TREVES

How blind of me. Is there anything

else, John, anything at all that I

could get for you?

MERRICK

Oh no! There is nothing! I have

everything, you have given me

everything I could possibly want. I

am happy every hour of the day. I

only wish there was something I could

give to you.

TREVES

Please John, it would give me so

much pleasure to give you something.

Something just for yourself. Isn't

there something you would like to

have?

TREVES

You want a dressing bag, John?

MERRICK

You don't think it's too gaudy, do

you?

MOTHERSHEAD

Mr. Treves, some more books arrived

for Mr. Merrick.

TREVES

Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter

put them in my office.

MOTHERSHEAD

Yes sir.

(seeing the ad)

What's that?

TREVES

A dressing bag.

MOTHERSHEAD

Very smart indeed.

TREVES

Yes. John wants it.

MOTHERSHEAD

A dressing bag?

TREVES

You don't think it's too gaudy, do

you.

MOTHERSHEAD

Well...

TREVES

John thinks it's very dashing.

Something no gentleman should be

without. I'm inclined to agree.

MOTHERSHEAD

A dressing bag?

MERRICK

Night!

FADE TO BLACK:

TREVES

You stay with me.

ANNE

(calling from the

next room)

Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.

ANNE

More romances for John?

TREVES

(far away)

Hmmm?

ANNE

...Freddie! What's the matter? You've

been like this all evening.

TREVES

Oh... I've just been thinking about

something that man Bytes said.

ANNE

Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched

vampire say to upset you?

TREVES

That I am very little different from

him.

ANNE

Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no

Frederick, that's all wrong! John is

happier and more fulfilled now than

he has ever been in his entire life.

And, that is completely due to you.

TREVES

But why did I do it? What was this

all for? So John Merrick could live

out his last days in peace and

comfort? Or so I could become famous?

ANNE

Frederick, just what is it that you

are saying?

TREVES

...Am I a good man or am I a bad

man?

ANNE

Oh Frederick.

ANNE

You're a good man. A very good man.

CARR

Ahh! Broadneck! You'll no doubt be

pleased to know that we've received

a smashing response to my letter.

It's all very heartwarming, though

several letters do mention how beastly

it would be to part the poor fellow

from Mr. Treves and the staff, but

since the committee insists...

BROADNECK

(scowling)

Good day, Carr Gomm.

MOTHERSHEAD

Is this all there is for John?

CARR

I'm afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead.

Perhaps tomorrow.

CUT TO:

MOTHERSHEAD

What is it? What is it?

TREVES

Don't you think this is a bit

premature? We don't have the backing

yet to...

CARR

Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.

CARR

Gentlemen, I know we begin every

meeting by reading the minutes, but

in the interest of speed I think we

should conclude a matter discussed

previously, to wit, that of Mr. John

Merrick, the Elephant Man...

CARR

Mr. Broadneck?

BROADNECK

Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct

impression that we had concluded

discussion of this disagreeable

matter. Had we not ascertained that

an Elephant Man is not acceptable as

a patient? Have we not, very

generously, allowed the creature to

use two of our rooms until such time

as he could be properly disposed of?

Have we not...

MERRICK

I must be more careful!

BROADNECK

Which brings to mind my next point.

The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In

a society such as ours, it is of

paramount importance that we not

stray from the established order.

Has that order not already been

fearfully strained by allowing this...

this... sideshow exhibit to take up

residence, however temporary, in two

very useful rooms, the purpose of

which would be far better served in

accommodating treatable patients,

patients to whom this hospital was

originally dedicated? I believe we

have a duty...

MERRICK

...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home...

it's cloudy out, I know, but remember;

behind the clouds there is always

the sun.

BROADNECK

...In light of these facts, our course

is clear. The question is not whether

to accept this creature as a patient,

the question is when will those rooms

be vacated for use by better

qualified, more deserving cases? I

move that this Elephant Man be removed

from the premises immediately. We

have a sacred duty to cure the sick,

not care for circus animals. That is

my last word on the subject. Mr.

Chairman, shall we vote?

CARR GOMM

I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your

mind is fixed on this matter?

BROADNECK

Mr. Chairman! Don't you have ears? I

am unalterably opposed to any...

BROADNECK

...No, my mind is made up on this,

and I am resolved to stand firm. You

shall not sway me. May we now vote,

Mr. Chairman, at long last?

CARR

Yes, I believe that time has come.

1ST FOOTMAN

Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness

Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

ALIX

Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I am

not interrupting?

CARR

Indeed not, your Highness. Your

presence is always greatly

appreciated. We were just about to

put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a

vote.

(he turns to the other

committee members)

The Princess is very interested in

Mr. Merrick's fate.

ALIX

Indeed I am sir, as is the Queen.

I have a brief communication from

her Highness which she has requested

I read to you: To the Governing

Committee, London Hospital. I would

very much like to commend you for

the charitable face you have shown

Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

It is laudable that you have provided

one of England's most unfortunate

sons with a safe and tranquil harbour,

a home. For this immeasurable

kindness, as well as the many other

acts of mercy on behalf of the poor,

of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me

informed, I gratefully thank you.

Signed Victoria, Empress of India,

Queen of the United Kingdom of Great

Britain and Ireland.

(looking straight at

Broadneck)

I am sure you gentlemen may be counted

on to do the Christian thing.

CARR

Thank you very much, your Highness,

you may be sure we shall.

CARR

Well then, I move that Mr. John

Merrick be admitted to the London

Hospital on a permanent basis, on

condition that the Hospital shall

receive a yearly payment equal to

the cost of occupying one bed, and

that the funds for his care shall be

clearly separate from hospital funds.

All those in favor.

CARR

The motion is carried.

CARR

Well, now we may go about our normal

business.

MERRICK

Please, come in.

TREVES

(smiling broadly)

Good afternoon, John, Mr. Carr Gomm

has something he would like to say

to you.

CARR

Mr. Merrick, it is my great pleasure

to welcome you, officially to The

London Hospital. The Governing

Committee this morning voted

unanimously to provide you these

rooms on a permanent basis. This is

your home now. I'm so very, very

pleased for you.

TREVES

So you see, John, there's no need

for a lighthouse. All your friends

are here.

MOTHERSHEAD

Welcome home, John.

MERRICK

...my... home?

TREVES

Yes, John.

MERRICK

You did this for me?

TREVES

Yes.

MERRICK

Please... please thank the governing

committee for me. I will do my utmost

to merit their kindness.

MERRICK

(trying the words on

for size)

My home.

TREVES

There is one more thing, John. Here.

TREVES

Is it the one you wanted?

MERRICK

Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.

TREVES

Are you sure? Because I can take it

back.

MERRICK

Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.

MAN

NIGHT PORTER

I... I don't know what you mean,

Sir.

TREVES

Don't lie to me. I know all about

it. You were SEEN. Where did you

take him?

NIGHT PORTER

Take him? Now wait... I didn't take

him anywhere. We were just having

some fun. We didn't hurt him... just

having a laugh, that's all.

TREVES

HE'S GONE!

NIGHT PORTER

When I left him, he was in his bed,

safe and sound.

TREVES

YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU

TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is

HE?

NIGHT PORTER

(enraged)

YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't

done nothing wrong. People pay to

see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just

take the money.

TREVES

YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK!

GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!

NIGHT PORTER

Have a care, Mr. Treves. I ain't

afraid of you! You and your bleedin'

Elephant Man! I'm glad what I did!

And you can't do nothing! Only

Mothershead can sack me.

MOTHERSHEAD

Done.

CARR (V.O. THROUGHOUT)

I'd like to think I felt no less for

John than you, Treves, but face the

facts, the man has disappeared, very

likely to the continent. There's no

question of your going after him,

you're desperately needed here by

your patients. Remember Treves, you

did everything in your power...

everything in your power.

There's a policeman to see you, Sir.

BOBBY

Are you Frederick Treves, sir?

TREVES

Yes...

SERGEANT

You know this man, sir?

TREVES

Yes, he's... my friend.

MERRICK

Mr. Treves! Treves.

TREVES

John.... how can you ever forgive

me?

KENDAL

It's all arranged. I'll send over

some evening gowns for the sisters

that you select to accompany Mr.

Merrick. You'll be using the Royal

entrance and Princess Alexandra

herself will be there to welcome him

to her private box.

TREVES

I'm very grateful to you, Mrs.

Kendal. This is just the thing to

help him forget his ordeal. John

will be very excited.

KENDAL

Well it is a miracle he ever got

back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves,

under your expert care, he'll have

many happy years ahead.

TREVES

I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the

short time he was gone the size of

his head has increased rapidly... as

is his pain.

KENDAL

How awful for John.

TREVES

And yet, not once have any of us

heard him complain.

KENDAL

Is he... dying then?

TREVES

Yes. There is nothing more

frustrating, nothing that makes a

physician feel more useless, than

standing by watching his patient

deteriorate. And when that patient

is a friend, no... no, there's

absolutely nothing I can do.

KENDAL

Well, it's all quite... I've never

heard... It's quite...

TREVES

(understandingly)

Yes.

MERRICK

You women are such strange and

wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems

to be my fate to fall in love with

each and everyone of you. I especially

wish you could all be with me

tonight... I'm finally going to the

theatre.

MERRICK

...The theatre...

CHORUS

O for a Muse of fire, that would

On this unworthy scaffold to bring

forth

So great an object: can this cockpit

hold

The vasty fields of Rance? Or may we

cram

Within this wooden O the very casques

That did affright the air at

Agincourt?

O, pardon! since a crooked figure

may

Attest in little place a million;

And let us, ciphers to this great

account,

On your imaginary forces work.

K. HEN

Fair Katharine, and most fair, will

you vouchsafe to teach a soldier

terms

Such as will enter at a lady's ear

And plead his love-suit to her gentle

heart?

KATH

Your majesty shall mock at me; I

cannot speak your England.

K. HEN

O fair Katharine, if you will love

me soundly with your French heart, I

will be glad to hear you confess it

brokenly with your English tongue.

Do you like me, Kate?

KATH

Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is

"like me".

K. HEN

An angel is like you, Kate, and you

are like an angel.

KATH

O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes

sont pleines de tramperies.

K. HEN

What say you, fair one? That the

tongues of men are full of deceits?

KATH

Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be

full of deceits.

K. HEN

I know no way to mince it in love,

but directly to say "I love you".

What! A speaker is but a prater; a

rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg

will fall; a straight back will stoop;

a black beard will turn white; a

curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair

face will wither; a full eye will

wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate,

is the sun and the moon, or rather

the sun and not the moon; for it

shines bright and never changes, but

keeps his course truly.

CHORUS

Thus far, with rough and allunable

pen,

Our bending author hath pursued the

story,

In little room confining mighty men,

Mangling by starts the full course

of their glory.

Small time, but in that small most

greatly liv'd

This star of England: Fortune made

his sword;

By which the world's best garden he

achiev'd.

MRS. KENDAL

Thank you for your warm greeting.

Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's

performance was very special to me,

because it was very special to someone

else, a man who knows the theatre

and loves the theatre, and yet tonight

is the first time he's ever actually

been here. I would like to dedicate...

the whole company wishes to dedicate,

from their hearts, tonight's

performance to Mr. John Merrick, my

dear friend.

TREVES

Stand up, John. Let them see you.

MERRICK

Oh no, I couldn't.

TREVES

It's for you, John. It's all for

you. Go ahead, let them see you.

MERRICK

(quietly, to Treves)

I feel as if I've traveled my whole

life just to stand here.

CUT TO:

MERRICK

Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't

blame the King for wanting to marry

her.

TREVES

Will the cathedral be finished soon,

John?

MERRICK

Yes, very soon.

TREVES

Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece.

Well, I suppose I'll be on my way

now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself

this evening.

MERRICK

Oh yes! It was wonderful!

TREVES

I'm glad, John. Goodnight.

MERRICK

Mr. Treves?

TREVES

Yes John?

MERRICK

Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly.

Is it alright, did I make any mistakes

that you can see?

TREVES

(looking at the

cathedral)

No, John, not one that I can see.

MERRICK

Then I shouldn't change anything?

TREVES

No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.

MERRICK

...I'll walk you to the door.

TREVES

Goodnight John. Sleep well.

MERRICK

You too, my friend. Goodnight.

MERRICK

It is finished.

MERRICK

John... Merrick!

DISSOLVE TO:

MERRICK (V.O.)

When will the stream be aweary of

flowing under my eye?

MERRICK (V.O.)

When will the wind be aweary of

blowing over the sky?

MERRICK (V.O.)

When will the clouds be aweary of

fleeting?

MERRICK (V.O.)

When will the heart be aweary of

beating....

MERRICK (V.O.)

...and nature die?

JOHN'S MUM

Never, oh! Never, nothing will die;

the stream flows, the wind blows,

the cloud fleets, the heart beats...

JOHN'S MUM

Nothing will die.
