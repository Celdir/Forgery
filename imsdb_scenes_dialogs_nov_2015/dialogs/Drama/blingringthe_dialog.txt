1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1

A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards

us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat

suit stumbles.

DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)

(laughing)

Shit.

GIRL 1 (REBECCA)

C'mon. Hurry up.

They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the

leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the

bottom of the chain link fence.

She rolls under, and the others follow.

A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in

unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

They've done this before, they have it down.

One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as

they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back

window open.

A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as

she climbs inside into a laundry room.

She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they

slip inside.

Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.

She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is

totally cool and composed.

She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-

brow.

REBECCA

Let's go shopping!

And she pulls open the closet door.

CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a

Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of

prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a

mirror posing, then gets back to it.

The kids exit with their hoods up, carrying out the Louis

Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry.

CUT TO:

The kids make their get-away:

One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out.

They get into the Toyota and peel out.

THE BLING RING

CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off.

Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive

teenagers and news clips.

We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the

kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.

Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels.

We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night.

CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the

hat we saw her try on earlier.

Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags.

T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for

pictures.

Girls, time to get up!

Sam struggles to sit up, she's in a tight tank with bed head.

She rolls her eyes.

SAM

Oh my lord, you were so out of

control last night.

NICKI

What about you! You were all over

that old guy, the manager...

Sam laughs.

Oh yeah. He was totally perving

out.

She starts to slip into skinny jeans.

Laurie, Nicki's mom, pretty ex-playboy model in her 40's in

Juicy sweatpants and a tank top, gets breakfast ready.

She opens a cabinet as she calls up to them. A little Yorkie

nips at her heels.

LAURIE

Girls! Time for your aderall! Let's

go!

Emily, 13, sleepily sits down for some cereal.

EMILY

Mom, they got home so late last

night.

Laurie with wide eyes and a forced calm voice answers her.

LAURIE

That's none of your concern, I'll

handle it.

She calls up to them again.

NICKI

We know...

Laurie tries to sound cheerful and in control.

LAURIE

Let's have our morning prayer and

then we'll meet in the living room

at eight to start today's lesson on

the laws of attraction, OK?

They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her

prayer.

LAURIE (CONT'D)

My chief aim in life is to

continually strive to express my

greatest potential as a spiritual

human being and contributor to the

greater good for our planet and all

those who live on it. I know that

I have the ability to reach my aim

in life, by persistent action and

that the thoughts of my mind will

reproduce themselves in outward

physical reality.

I will channel my energy towards my

aim in life with graciousness and

loving kindness to myself and

others.

LAURIE AND GIRLS (IN UNISON)

And so it is.

Alone in his room, Marc pulls a drawer out from under his bed-

it's filled with designer clothes and bags. He just looks at

it all and touches it.

We see him lying on the bed, with a fur vest as a pillow, and

something I'd love it, but it's

just kind of awkward for me that

MALE TMZ REPORTER

How does it feel to be a rat?

Marc keeps walking, lawyers by his side, music takes over the

sound and it becomes slow motion. Flashes go off and he makes

his way through the mayhem.

CUT TO:

131   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                       131

We see Marc, Chloe, Nicki and Rob sitting in a row, dressed

for court.

CUT TO:

132   INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - DAY                                  132

Rebecca, dressed for court, walks with her mother, who's hair

is pulled back severely. She's dressed in a dark suit and

tinted glasses. They are flanked by lawyers. She speaks

coldly to her in Korean, Rebecca answers her in English.

REBECCA'S MOM (IN KOREAN)

Sit up straight, and speak up when

you answer questions.

REBECCA

Ok.

REBECCA'S MOM (IN KOREAN)

What were you thinking? While I was

working to support you and your

sister. I gave you every thing...

You've never done anything right.

CUT TO:

133   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                       133

Rebecca enters with her mom and lawyers and is brought to a

row of seats with Marc, Nicki, Chloe and Rob.

She is seated next to Marc, but doesn't look at him. Marc

looks over at her, but she stares ahead.

The court room door closes.

BAM- we hear the sound of a gavel banging over black.

residential burglary.                                   *

Flashes and coverage continues as they leave. Nicki sobs, we

freeze frame on her through a paparazzi's long lens for a few

frames and then continue. A distressed Laurie follows like a

protective Lioness.

Marc looks in shock and keeps his head low, and Rebecca looks

pissed as they are led out.

We see news cameras descending on them.

135   EXT. LOS ANGELES POLICE STATION - DAY                       135

It's a sunny afternoon. We see Marc handcuffed to criminals

being led onto a white bus that reads: County of Los Angeles

Sheriff's department.

136   INT. PRISON BUS - DAY                                       136

Marc sits next to a big, hard-looking criminal.

CLOSE ON Marc's face as he looks out the window, while the

bus pulls away. Light streams in on his pale face. He looks

out as the Los Angeles streets go by.

Cut back to Marc's young face looking out the window, music

starts, and the bus drives out of frame.

FADE TO BLACK.

trying to be strong, I just tried

to really keep to myself..., I just

tried to get through the day , the

days are so long you're woken up at
