CURTIS

(takes a seat)

No, no, no...Don't feed the dog

darlin'.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Thanks babe.

SAMANTHA

You slept late.

CURTIS

Yeah. I need to go. What you got

going today?

SAMANTHA

I've got to finish up some curtains

for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are

coming over.

CURTIS

(MOUTH FULL)

With the kids?

SAMANTHA

Yeah. Cammie said she just needed

to get out of the house.

CURTIS

Tell Nat to take it easy on her.

SAMANTHA

Cam can hold her own. We need to

send in the deposit for the beach

condo.

3.

CURTIS

(SIGNING)

I love you.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Just write the check, babe. Okay.

SAMANTHA

Okay. Bye.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

(as she signs)

No more food. You, eat.

CURTIS

Yeah, let's keep going with that

bit! It'll go another 10 feet!

DEWART

We won't get the gravel pack down

today!

CURTIS

Why not?!

4.

DEWART

Those clouds! We're gonna have to

call it!

CURTIS

Happy hour starts at five Dewart!

DEWART

(TO HIMSELF)

Not if it's rainin'...Ready?

CURTIS

Oh, yeah.

NAT

They were just drinkin' and

laughin' and oh, my god...it was

like I was bein' in a museum and I

saw the progress from apes to men.

I saw it. I saw the future.

Dewart, that was him...that was

going to be him in 20 years.

SAMANTHA

Oh my god.

NAT

Let me tell you, you laugh. You

laugh. But this little one in your

arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar

just like `em. Yep...

(GLANCES OUTSIDE)

Hannah!

5.

SAMANTHA

You guys okay?

SUE

Yeah.

SAMANTHA

No. Don't touch.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

(signing and speaking)

You understand?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Oksy. Come here.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.

6.

DEWART

What? It's not my fault! I told

you!

CURTIS

Yeah. All right...All right! I'm

callin' it! Shut it down!

SAMANTHA

Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.

NAT

I'll call next week about the Lions

Club supper.

SAMANTHA

Okay. Love you.

CAMMIE

Bye Sam.

SAMANTHA

Bye Cam.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?

7.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Storm.

CURTIS

I gotta get home.

DEWART

Nat and me been lookin' into a

threesome. We've been chattin' with

a girl online from Canton. Yeah.

Big `ol girl.

CURTIS

What's big?

DEWART

She's about two fifty, two seventy

five. She can't be no taller than

5 foot.

CURTIS

Shit man.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I don't see me and Sam gettin' into

somethin' like that.

DEWART

No. I don't guess you would.

DEWART (CONT'D)

You got a good life Curtis.

8.

DEWART (CONT'D)

I'm serious. I think that's the

best compliment you can give a man,

take a look at his life and say,

that's good. That guy's doin'

somethin' right.

CURTIS

Well. It ain't always so easy.

DEWART

Hell I know that.

DEWART (CONT'D)

Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.

CURTIS

Good night.

CURTIS

(SOFTLY)

Hey baby.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

She do all right today?

9.

SAMANTHA

She was fine. She's still not

playin' with the others, though.

She can't connect. Honey, you

gotta clean up that trash pile in

the back. She fished out a board

that had nails on it.

CURTIS

I'll get to it this weekend.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I still take off my boots so I

won't wake her up.

SAMANTHA

I still whisper.

10.

11.

SAMANTHA

Curtis?

CURTIS

What?

SAMANTHA

Did you hear me? You got to be

home, showered, ready to walk out

the door by six tonight.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

CURTIS

Nothing. I just want her to eat her

breakfast and stop playin' with the

damn dog.

SAMANTHA

She's fine down there. She had

toast already.

CURTIS

Hannah. Come here. Hannah.

SAMANTHA

Curtis?

CURTIS

What?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I'm late.

SAMANTHA

You didn't eat anything?

CURTIS

It's okay.

12.

JIM

I didn't say you had control over

the weather Russell, what I did say

was that the top shelf has to be

cleared by the 15th. That's non-

negotiable.

JIM (CONT'D)

Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that

east 82nd site?

CURTIS

Yesterday slowed us down. We

couldn't get the second pilot hole

drilled.

JIM

It rained for two hours yesterday.

Two hours and our entire schedule

went in the toilet. We lose the

permit if you're not out of there

by end of day.

CURTIS

Yes sir.

JIM

End of day Curtis.

JIM (CONT'D)

All right. Valerie tells me that

the father son pancake cook off...

13.

CURTIS

Hey, I gotta make a stop before we

head out there.

DEWART

Think we got time?

CURTIS

Yeah. There's time.

CURTIS

Sonofabitch.

DEWART

We stripped that bit.

CURTIS

Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta

re-set it.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Shit.

14.

DEWART

Curtis!

CURTIS

You ever see birds fly like that?!

DEWART

(holding his hand to his

EAR)

What?!

CURTIS

(TO HIMSELF)

Shit.

SAMANTHA

Come on we gotta go.

CURTIS

Ah, Jesus. I could really use a

shower.

15.

TEACHER (O.S.)

So if you continue with the basic

vocabulary, this will allow you to

communicate with your children

better.

TEACHER (CONT'D)

Between the ages of four and seven

the focus is more on the sign and

then later we'll begin adding the

alphabet as more of a support

syster. Now in ASL...

TEACHER (CONT'D)

...the male sign is signed at the

forehead area. For example, father

is signed up here like

this...Father, very good.

16.

SAMANTHA

You're not sorry.

CURTIS

I am sorry.

SAMANTHA

Well, you stink. You smell really

bad.

CURTIS

I think I smell good.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Do I smell good?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

See. Maybe I should marry her

instead.

SAMANTHA

Stop.

CURTIS

(signing and speaking)

You okay?

17.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

SHIT!

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You're okay.

18.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hannah! Hannah!

SAMANTHA

Here honey. Put on your shoes

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Good, you're up.

19.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Honey, you're soaked.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Are you sick?

CURTIS

I've felt better.

SAMANTHA

I guess we could stay home if we

need to.

CURTIS

Where you goin'?

SAMANTHA

It's Saturday, I was going to take

Hannah to my booth.

CURTIS

Oh. Yeah.

SAMANTHA

You look really sick honey.

CURTIS

I'm all right. It's just a cold or

somethin'.

SAMANTHA

Let me get you some Advil.

CURTIS

No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll

just go. I'll be fine.

SAMANTHA

You sure?

CURTIS

Yeah.

(holds up the mug)

Better already.

20.

SAMANTHA

Okay. I got my phone if you need

anything. Don't forget Sunday

lunch is here tomorrow.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

If you're sick, we should cancel.

CURTIS

I'll be all right.

SAMANTHA

Okay, we'll talk later.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Come on. Let's go.

(TO CURTIS)

You sure?

CURTIS

Honey, please.

SAMANTHA

Okay.

21.

BARGAIN HUNTER

How much you asking for this

pillow?

22.

SAMANTHA

This pillow's fifteen dollars.

BARGAIN HUNTER

That's more than I want to spend.

SAMANTHA

This is all hand stitched. It takes

a really long time. That's why I

charge that.

BARGAIN HUNTER

I'll give you seven for it.

SAMANTHA

I can't go that low.

BARGAIN HUNTER

Well that's my offer.

SAMANTHA

How about 10?

BARGAIN HUNTER

I'll give you eight, but it's in

change.

SAMANTHA

That's fine.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Lucky for you she likes to count

change.

CURTIS

Red! Come on.

23.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Get in.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Good boy.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I'm sorry about this buddy. We

just gotta work it like this for

awhile okay?

24.

NEWS ANCHOR

(ON TELEVISION)

While rescue workers made several

attempts to reach the family,

Walter Jacobs wife...

25.

SAMANTHA

But that's what I don't understand.

If he didn't do anything why did

you put him out back?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

What?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

You hear me? I said if he didn't

do anything why did you have to put

him outside?

CURTIS

I just wanted him to be outside for

awhile.

SAMANTHA

He's your dog. He's always been an

inside dog.

CURTIS

He's my dog, and that's why he's

outside. Right now with Hannah and

everything I just think it'd be

better.

SAMANTHA

Hannah loves Red.

CURTIS

Hold on.

NEWS ANCHOR

...the gas cloud spread across

their six acre property.

(MORE)

26.

NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)

The only way off their land was

across the train tracks which were

blocked by wreckage.

WALTER JACOBS

(from a hospital bed)

I tried using some wet rags and

towels to breathe through but that

just seemed to make it worse.

NEWS ANCHOR

While rescue workers made several

attempts to reach the family,

Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in-

law died in the home. Jacobs

survived despite enduring eleven

hours of exposure to the gas cloud

before finally being flown out by

helicopter.

CURTIS

You hearin' this?

SAMANTHA

It's awful.

CURTIS

Eleven hours. No way out.

27.

CURTIS

Hannah.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hey!

28.

CURTIS

Babe?

SAMANTHA

Yeah?

CURTIS

You got the number for Dr. Shannan?

SAMANTHA

You're still not feeling good?

CURTIS

Yeah, but you got the number?

SAMANTHA

Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed

today.

29.

CURTIS

Right. Yeah. I'll call tomorrow.

SAMANTHA

Honey if you're not feeling good we

take you in somewhere.

CURTIS

No. Stop!

SAMANTHA

Okay. Do you want me to cancel

lunch today...

CURTIS

Shit...

SAMANTHA

What is that?

CURTIS

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I

got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm

taking it out on you.

SAMANTHA

I was gonna leave Hannah with you

so I could go to church, but I'm

not going to with you like this.

CURTIS

It's fine. I'll be fine.

SAMANTHA

No. She needs breakfast.

CURTIS

(STERN)

I've got it.

SAMANTHA

I'm sorry that you feel bad but you

need to drop the attitude.

CURTIS

Come on. Just go.

SAMANTHA

What's wrong with you?

CURTIS

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go.

30.

SAMANTHA

Hannah's in the den. We have

cereal for her.

CURTIS

We're going out.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

(with open palms)

We're going out. Okay? It's okay.

31.

CURTIS

You stay put okay?

32.

SAMANTHA

Let's just start.

MELVIN

Let's all join hands for the

blessing.

SAMANTHA

Where the hell have you been?

CURTIS

I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an

errand.

SAMANTHA

You're really late.

CURTIS

I know.

SAMANTHA

You didn't even bring your cell

phone.

33.

MELVIN

Missed you at church this mornin'

Curtis.

SAMANTHA

Dad.

MELVIN

He knows what to do if he wants me

to stop askin'.

CURTIS

Was it a good service?

MELVIN

It was. It was good work.

CURTIS

I'm thinking about cleaning up that

storm shelter out back.

34.

NURSE

Curtis?

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Curtis, how you doin' bud?

CURTIS

Hey Doc.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

How's my girl?

35.

CURTIS

She's good.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

That's good to hear. Tilt your

head back for me.

CURTIS

I don't have a cold.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Oh. Did she get that down wrong?

CURTIS

No, I just told her that.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Oh. So what's the problem?

CURTIS

I've been havin'...I've been having

some trouble sleepin'. I was

hopin' you could give me somethin'

for it.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

How long's this been goin' on?

CURTIS

`Bout four nights now.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

You're not sleepin' at all?

CURTIS

Well some, but real restless.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Well, I think four nights is a

little too soon to tell. My advice

would be to not eat or drink

anything after 8 o'clock at night.

Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,

tobacco, caffeine...get some daily

exercise.

36.

CURTIS

Well, I think...

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I think I may need to try some

medication.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Why do you say that?

CURTIS

(STILL RELUCTANT)

The reason I've been having trouble

sleeping is because of some dreams

I've been havin'. I didn't think

it was anything at first, but then

the other day I woke up and the bed

was wet.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

You urinated in your bed?

CURTIS

Yeah. Couple days before that I

had a dream that my dog attacked me

and it took all day for the pain in

my arm to go away.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

You been to see your mother lately?

CURTIS

It's been about a month.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

Okay. This is a prescription for a

pretty mild sedative. It's non-

habit forming, but I'm only giving

you enough for a few days anyway.

Take it and see if it helps. In

the meantime,

(holds up the other slip)

This is the number of a good friend

of mine in Columbus. He's a

psychiatrist. It's a drive, but

he's the best I know.

37.

CURTIS

Okay.

DOCTOR SHANNAN

I'll give him a call and let him

know you'll be down to see him.

CURTIS

All right.

CURTIS

Hey Dewart!

DEWART

(HALF TURNING)

What you say Curtis?

CURTIS

Not much.

DEWART

They want us to get a pilot hole

drilled by lunch. I figure worse

comes to worse we can eat on the

rig.

CURTIS

Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend

all right?

DEWART

Yeah. Same old shit.

38.

INSURANCE AGENT (O.S.)

No. I need the name of the

specialist whose diagnosis you'll

accept.

INSURANCE AGENT

(into the phone)

No. Look it. I've told you this

twice. Please. Just get me the name

and or the approval code.

(BEAT)

Okay.

INSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

All right. And the phone. Well

great. Thank you very much.

INSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D)

This is the name and number of the

specialist who the insurance

company approves of. Just call and

make an appointment. Now if this

doctor signs off , you should have

the implant procedure fully

covered. I'm sorry it took so

long.

SAMANTHA

Can I give you a hug?

39.

INSURANCE AGENT

It's fine. It's fine. You know

your husband's company actually has

very good insurance when it kicks

in. Not a lot of jobs offer

policies half as good. You're very

lucky.

PHARMACIST

That's okay. We have your

insurance on file. That'll be

$47.64.

CURTIS

What's the co-pay?

PHARMACIST

That is your co-pay.

CURTIS

Hey.

SAMANTHA

I love you.

CURTIS

I love you too.

SAMANTHA

I have good news.

40.

SAMANTHA

Green? How `bout a red?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

It was like talking to a sane

person for once. She made one

phone call. That's it. I've been

trying that 800 number for weeks.

CURTIS

It's great. It's great.

(TO HANNAH)

Hey, Hannah.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You excited? Huh? We're gonna get

you some help.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

How do you say...sign excited?

SAMANTHA

Like this.

CURTIS

Excited. Yeah?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Now I got to do you.

41.

SAMANTHA

Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's

a 2-1 and it sits directly on the

beach. Wouldn't that be great? We

wouldn't have to worry about Hannah

crossing traffic.

CURTIS

What's the rent?

SAMANTHA

Eight ninety nine a week.

CURTIS

That sounds real nice.

42.

SAMANTHA

You sleep well?

CURTIS

Yeah. I did.

SAMANTHA

You look like you're feeling

better.

CURTIS

You want me to come there and do it

for you? Jesus.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hey, how much food do you think

you'd need to live on for a week?

DEWART

What do you mean?

CURTIS

I mean to stay alive. What do you

think you'd need?

DEWART

Not a lot.

CURTIS

You think?

DEWART

I don't know. You hear about

people livin' for days all the time

offa bark and melted snow.

CURTIS

I've never heard of that.

DEWART

Shit I don't know. You asked the

question.

CURTIS

It's on there. It's on. Come on.

43.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Dammit.

DEWART

What?

CURTIS

It sounds like thunder.

DEWART

What sounds like thunder?

DEWART (CONT'D)

Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you

goin'?

44.

45.

SARAH

Curtis.

CURTIS

Hey Mom.

SARAH

Come in.

CURTIS

Sure.

CURTIS

I'm going to get some water.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You want some?

SARAH

No.

SARAH

Isn't she lovely.

CURTIS

Mom?

46.

SARAH

Yes.

CURTIS

I need to ask you somethin'.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Do you remember what year we

brought you up here? To the first

place.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

It was `86.

SARAH

Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a

senior.

CURTIS

I was 10.

SARAH

Yes.

CURTIS

Can you remember what happened

before you got diagnosed?

SARAH

What do you mean?

CURTIS

I mean...I just want to know how it

all started. Before you had to

leave.

SARAH

Oh, I don't know. I remember it

was a real stressful time. Your

father was gone a lot, and I

couldn't handle things on my own.

CURTIS

Did you ever have any dreams? Like

bad dreams.

SARAH

No. Nothing like that. There was

always...

(MORE)

47.

SARAH (CONT'D)

(searches for the words)

There was always a panic that took

hold of me. I thought people were

watching me or listening to me.

I...

CURTIS

It's all right. It's all right.

It's fine.

SARAH

Are you okay?

CURTIS

Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

CURTIS

(into the phone)

May I have the number for Doctor

George Shannan?

(WAITS)

Thanks.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I

speak with him? This is Curtis

LaForche.

(WAITS)

Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to

call you at home, I just don't

think I can make it to Columbus to

see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's

just too far. Is there somewhere

local you can send me?

48.

SAMANTHA

Hey.

CURTIS

Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up.

SAMANTHA

It's okay. Where you been?

CURTIS

I went to see mom.

SAMANTHA

Is she okay?

CURTIS

Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up

on her.

SAMANTHA

You shoulda told me we would have

gone with you.

CURTIS

That's okay.

SAMANTHA

Come to bed.

CURTIS

I will in a bit.

49.

MYERS

Well you've kept up with the

payments on the house.

50.

CURTIS

We've been good about that.

MYERS

I gotta tell you Curtis, banks

aren't loaning money the way they

used to. We've got you a loan

today, but the interest rates are

variable and we have to tie it to

your house.

CURTIS

That's fine.

MYERS

Curtis, I've known you a long time.

We financed your house for you, two

vehicles. I'm telling you this is

a risky loan you're taking.

CURTIS

I need the money John.

MYERS

Okay.

CURTIS

Hey.

DEWART

Hey.

CURTIS

Sorry I left you yesterday.

51.

DEWART

Jim came by. I covered for you.

CURTIS

Thanks.

DEWART

I need your help with the depth

charts.

CURTIS

Sure.

DEWART

Fuckin' Nat put me in charge of

frying oysters for that Lions Club

supper.

CURTIS

You need another burner?

DEWART

Yeah, if you still got yours I

could use it.

CURTIS

You think you could help me with

somethin'?

DEWART

Whatta you need?

CURTIS

I'm gonna build out the tornado

shelter in my backyard. I could

use some help.

DEWART

The hell you wanna do that for?

CURTIS

Just needs to be done.

DEWART

What do you need?

52.

CURTIS

I figure I'll do it on Saturday,

borrow some equipment from work.

DEWART

You sure about that?

CURTIS

I just need a backhoe, a hauler.

I'll rent the rest.

DEWART

Yeah. Whatever. I'll help.

CURTIS

Thanks.

DEWART

You all right man?

CURTIS

What do you mean?

DEWART

I just don't wanna see you fuck up.

CURTIS

I'm not.

53.

KENDRA (O.S.)

Come in.

KENDRA

Hi.

CURTIS

Hello.

KENDRA

Have a seat. I'm Kendra.

CURTIS

Curtis.

KENDRA

I'm gonna start by askin' you some

questions.

CURTIS

Okay. I already answered all the

questions on the forms.

KENDRA

Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but

I need to get a profile started on

you.

CURTIS

Right. Well...

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Out of the five possible symptoms

needed to be diagnosed with

SCHIZOPHRENIA:

(MORE)

54.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

(reads off the pad)

delusions, hallucinations,

disorganized speech, disorganized

behavior, and the negative

symptoms, I've had two. Delusions

and hallucinations. But they say

it has to continue for six months

to be diagnosed schizophrenia and

mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere

near that long. So, I took this

quiz in the back of the book and I

scored a five out of a possible

twenty. Schizophrenia starts at

twelve. So, they say it might be

a...

(reads off the pad)

brief psychotic disorder. Whatever

it is, I need to know what to do or

what to get on to get this thing

under control.

KENDRA

Look. I'm a counselor. Certified,

but I'm not a psychiatrist. I

can't prescribe anything to you. I

can talk to you, I can recommend

where to send you, but that's it.

KENDRA (CONT'D)

Now that said, if you want to talk,

I'll listen. For a lot of people

that's a good start.

KENDRA (CONT'D)

Now you said here that your mother

was diagnosed with paranoid

schizophrenia in her thirties. And

you're at 35. You wanna talk about

that?

CURTIS

Yeah, I don't know my mother's

symptoms. I was just 10. My

brother was 17. And, uh...I don't

know. She just left me in the car

in the parking lot at the grocery

store one day. And she didn't come

back. And then they found her a

week later eatin' trash out of a

dumpster in northern Kentucky.

(MORE)

55.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

My dad had to put her in the state

hospital in Columbus. And she's

been in assisted living ever since.

Yep. My dad raised me. He died

last April.

KENDRA

So tell me `bout these dreams.

SAMANTHA

I don't know what our schedule will

be, but...

TEACHER

That's all right. But I really do

think you should continue with the

sign language. And any additional

therapies that kids need for the

cochlear implant.

SAMANTHA

Absolutely.

TEACHER

Okay. Good night.

SAMANTHA

Good night.

56.

CURTIS

(TO HIMSELF)

Is anyone seeing this?

57.

CURTIS

Hey. It's all right. Calm down.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Samantha.

SAMANTHA

Are you out of your mind?

58.

SAMANTHA

Not a word. You didn't say one

word about this to me. Don't you

think you owe me that? Don't you

think that you might respect me

enough to at least consider what I

had to say?

CURTIS

I didn't want you worryin' about

it.

SAMANTHA

Well I'm worried Curtis. How are

you paying for all that?

CURTIS

I got a home improvement loan from

the bank.

SAMANTHA

How could you do that without

talking to me? You know the

expenses we have comin' up. You

want to waste money on a stupid

tornado shelter?

CURTIS

I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us.

I know you don't understand.

SAMANTHA

You're right. I don't understand.

I don't understand half the stuff

you've been doin' lately. I don't

understand you puttin' Red out

back. I don't understand you

stayin' up all night in that stupid

tornado shelter. You don't come to

bed half the time. You leave and

don't tell me where you're goin'.

Explain that to me. Please. Tell

me something that helps me

understand why you're bein' like

this.

59.

CURTIS

There's nothin' to explain.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed.

SAMANTHA

Curtis!

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my

God. Baby.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

I need an ambulance! My husband's

having a seizure. 41800 Tindale

Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding!

60.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

Okay. Okay.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Honey?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Honey? Are you okay?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

You were having a seizure. I

called an ambulance.

CURTIS

(into the phone)

No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't

send an ambulance. It's fine.

SAMANTHA

What are you doing?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Baby what's goin' on?

61.

CURTIS

I'm sorry you fellows had to come

all the way out.

EMT

It's what we do. Now we can still

take you in if you want a doctor to

look at those cuts in your mouth.

CURTIS

Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see

somebody on Monday.

EMT

All right.

CURTIS

Thanks.

CURTIS

I haven't been honest with you.

I'm sorry.

SAMANTHA

What's goin' on?

CURTIS

I've been havin' these dreams. I

guess they're more like nightmares.

It's why I've been actin' like

this.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

They always start with a kind of

storm. Like a real powerful storm.

(MORE)

62.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

And there's always this dark, thick

rain. Like fresh motor oil. And

then the things, people, it just

makes `em crazy. They attack me.

Sometimes they go after Hannah.

First one I had Red nearly chewed

through my arm.

SAMANTHA

That's why you put him out back?

CURTIS

Yeah.

SAMANTHA

What was the dream? Tonight.

CURTIS

It was Dewart. We were at the job

site. The storm started and

somethin' happened. His face. His

eyes were different. He came after

me with a pick ax. And we fought.

And he ran it through my leg.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

It's hard to explain, because it's

not just a dream. It's a feeling.

I'm afraid something might be

comin'. Something that's...not

right. I can not describe it. I

just need you to believe me.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I've been to a counselor. I've

seen her a few times.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You know what I come from. And I

promised myself...I promised myself

I would never leave. And I am

doin' everything that I can to make

that true.

63.

ATTENDANT

Since the doctor's approved her for

surgery, We just need to get her

scheduled. The next possible

opening is...

(reviews a calendar)

The 21st of next month. That's six

weeks.

CURTIS

Six weeks?

ATTENDANT

Is that okay?

SAMANTHA

It's wonderful.

RUSSELL

...this point just to the west. I

don't think we'll have any problem.

We should be able to get twenty,

maybe thirty in this next week. But

we're looking to see how that's

gonna shape up, so...

RUSSELL (CONT'D)

Curtis?

CURTIS

Yeah.

64.

RUSSELL

What do you think?

CURTIS

Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get

it done.

JIM

Come in.

JIM (CONT'D)

What you need Curtis?

CURTIS

I need a favor Jim.

JIM

What's that?

CURTIS

Can you take Dewart off my crew?

Just reassign him someplace else.

JIM

What's the trouble? He not pullin'

his weight?

CURTIS

No, nothin' like that. He's a good

worker. He's a good man. He's my

friend. I think it'd be easier not

being in charge of someone I'm so

close to.

JIM

You know, I understand. This is

part of what it means to manage

people Curtis. You're gonna have

to learn that.

65.

CURTIS

Yes sir. I appreciate that but...

well it would just be very helpful

in this case.

JIM

Okay. Well, I can put him with

Russell. Anybody else you prefer?

CURTIS

No. Whoever you think's right.

JIM

Okay.

CURTIS

Thank you.

JIM

You been missin' a lotta work

Curtis.

CURTIS

I know. My daughter's had a lot of

doctor's visits. I haven't let

anything get behind.

JIM

No. But don't. Okay.

CURTIS

Yessir.

SAMANTHA

I know they just usually do oysters

and fries but what if we did

something healthier on the side?

66.

NAT

What like slaw?

SAMANTHA

I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or

salad.

NAT

Dewart's been tellin' me how

strange Curtis has been actin'

lately. I am so sorry.

NAT (CONT'D)

It's not like you don't have enough

on your plate with Hannah.

SAMANTHA

Things are fine. We're fine.

OWNER

Can I help you?

CURTIS

Yeah. Can I look at one of these

gas masks?

OWNER

Sure. Which one you want to look

at?

CURTIS

The newest one.

67.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

How much?

OWNER

One seventy eight.

CURTIS

Anything cheaper?

OWNER

No. That's the cheapest one I got

in the store. They go all the way

up to two ninety. I don't know what

you want to spend but a gas mask

ain't something you want to go

cheap on.

CURTIS

You got any kids sizes?

OWNER

No. Kids can't wear those. They got

a have a special thing, its like a

hood. I don't fool with those.

CURTIS

Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em.

68.

KYLE (O.S.)

What the hell are you doin'?

KYLE (CONT'D)

What you got goin' on here?

CURTIS

Just addin' on to the storm

shelter.

KYLE

Why?

CURTIS

Just `cause.

KYLE

You runnin' water to it?

CURTIS

Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin'

sewer out to the city line.

KYLE

How much you spendin' on this

thing?

CURTIS

It's not bad.

KYLE

Doesn't look it.

KYLE (CONT'D)

You take your eye off the ball one

minute in this economy and you're

screwed. You got the cash for

this?

CURTIS

Yeah.

69.

KYLE

Don't put nothin' on credit cards.

That shit'll eat you up.

CURTIS

I'm not.

KYLE

Samantha called me.

CURTIS

I figured.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Called you to come tell me to quit?

KYLE

She called `cause she's worried.

Says you've been stressed out.

KYLE (CONT'D)

So?

CURTIS

So what?

KYLE

You stressed out?

CURTIS

No. No more than anybody else.

KYLE

Work all right?

CURTIS

Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come

by and have dinner sometime, Kyle.

That's fine. We'll have a beer and

talk about the old days, but you

got somethin' to say just say it.

KYLE

You can stop that shit right now.

I'll come over there and remind you

what it feels like to get your ass

whipped.

70.

KYLE (CONT'D)

I'm just coming here to check on

you.

CURTIS

Well I appreciate it Kyle.

KYLE

You been to see Mom?

CURTIS

Yeah. A few days ago.

KYLE

She all right.

CURTIS

You should see her. Take your

girls.

KYLE

Yeah. I'll get around to it.

KYLE (CONT'D)

You need a hand?

CURTIS

No. I've got it.

KYLE

Okay. Call me if you need me okay?

CURTIS

I will.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hey Kyle?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Actually you could do me a favor.

KYLE

What's that?

71.

CURTIS

You still looking for a dog?

KYLE

Sure.

CURTIS

They got a good spot for you, okay

bud.

KYLE

You sure?

CURTIS

Yeah.

KYLE

I know it'll make my girls happy.

All right.

CURTIS

Hey Kyle?

KYLE

Yeah?

CURTIS

Take care of yourself.

KYLE

All right. All right. I will little

brother. You take care of your

family. Handle your business.

Okay?

72.

KYLE (CONT'D)

All right.

CURTIS

All right. Bedtime.

73.

SAMANTHA

You okay?

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Who's that?

CURTIS

Ah shit.

CURTIS

Hey Jim.

JIM

Curtis. Dewart told me you took

equipment from work for a project

at your house. Said that's why you

wanted him off your crew. I came

out here to see it myself.

CURTIS

Yeah. It was just a hauler and a

backhoe. It was Saturday. I had

`em back in less than 8 hours.

JIM

You know that doesn't matter. I

can't even tell you how many rules

you broke.

(MORE)

74.

JIM (CONT'D)

What if you had an accident? Huh?

What if you ran somebody over on

your way out here? Lawsuit like

that could bankrupt me.

CURTIS

Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't

thought of that. Thank God nothin'

like that happened. You know? I'll

do whatever I can to make it right.

JIM

You can pick up your last check on

Friday. You've got two weeks

benefits.

CURTIS

Did you fire Dewart?

JIM

He's on two weeks leave unpaid...

I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to

yourself.

CURTIS

I've been fired.

SAMANTHA

What about the health insurance?

CURTIS

We get two more weeks.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...

75.

CURTIS

Oh, `scuse me.

ANDY

Are you Curtis?

CURTIS

Yeah.

ANDY

Come in. Kendra transferred out.

I'll be meeting with you today.

ANDY (CONT'D)

Please, sit down.

CURTIS

What happened to Kendra?

ANDY

She got into a program at OSU so

she'll be transferring near there.

I've split her case load with

another counselor. It's been kind

of crazy around here lately.

CURTIS

Huh.

ANDY

So I've looked over your file. It

says your mother was diagnosed with

paranoid schizophrenia in her early

thirties. Let's start there.

76.

SAMANTHA

I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.

WOMAN

That's okay. Don't worry about it.

SAMANTHA

Here. I hope you like them.

WOMAN

Thanks. I brought cash.

SAMANTHA

That's terrific. It's fine.

77.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Call me if they don't work and I'm

sorry again.

WOMAN

Oh, it's okay. Thank you.

SAMANTHA

What's that?

CURTIS

That's the alternator from the

truck.

(MORE)

78.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I was just trying to figure out a

way to charge enough batteries to

run lights down there. Ah, what the

hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your

old exercycle.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You gonna leave me?

SAMANTHA

You flinched when I touched your

hand this morning.

CURTIS

I'm sorry.

SAMANTHA

I was in one of your dreams?

CURTIS

Yeah.

SAMANTHA

Can you deal with that?

CURTIS

Yeah.

SAMANTHA

Okay. Then I made a decision. We

cancel the beach trip. We have

enough to cover bills for the next

two months with your last check.

I'm going to get a job. You're

gonna find another job. I'm going

to call to see if we can move

Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to

see what it costs to extend your

policy to the end of the year. I

want you to see a psychiatrist.

Not a counselor from the free

clinic. Someone good.

CURTIS

Doctor Shannan gave me the number

of somebody. But, uh, I just don't

think we can afford it.

79.

SAMANTHA

We'll find the money. Also, the

Lions Club supper's this weekend.

I want you to come with me.

CURTIS

I don't want to see any of those

people.

SAMANTHA

I want you to go. I need to do

something normal.

CURTIS

All right.

CURTIS

How many pieces does Hannah get?

SAMANTHA

Just one.

80.

DEWART

What're you doin' here?

CURTIS

Not here man.

DEWART

I said what are you doin' here.

SAMANTHA

Curtis.

DEWART

I told people what you been doin'.

CURTIS

I know.

DEWART

You cut me loose. Everything we

been through.

CURTIS

I know. I'm sorry.

DEWART

You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry

you wouldn't cut me loose. We

fuckin' friends! This how you

treat friends?

CURTIS

Come on.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

God dammit.

81.

SAMANTHA

STOP IT DEWART!

CURTIS

I SAID NOT HERE! GOD DAMNIT!

CURTIS (CONT'D)

You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that

what he told you!

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Well, listen up! There is a storm

comin' like nothing you have ever

seen. And not a one of you is

prepared for it.

(PACING)

You think I'm crazy? I'M TALKIN'

TO YOU RUSSELL!

(PACING)

LEWIS! You think I'm a thief?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Sleep well in your beds. Cause if

this thing comes true, there ain't

gonna be any more.

82.

CURTIS

Hannah?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hannah!

83.

SAMANTHA

Curtis! Wake up! Wake up!

84.

CURTIS

Come on. It's okay.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit

down.

SAMANTHA

No. Don't do that.

CURTIS

It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put

this on.

SAMANTHA

Are you kidding?

CURTIS

Please just do it. Okay?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

There we go. All right. Keep it out

of your eyes. Okay?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Hey. I love you. It's okay.

85.

SAMANTHA

Wake up babe.

CURTIS

Where's your mask?

SAMANTHA

We took them off. It's fine. Take

it off.

CURTIS

No.

SAMANTHA

We're fine. Take it off.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

You need to open the door now.

86.

CURTIS

(MUMBLES)

What if it's...What if it's not

over?

SAMANTHA

What?

CURTIS

What if it's not over?

SAMANTHA

It's over. Get the keys. Open the

door.

CURTIS

It's still storming.

SAMANTHA

No. It's not.

CURTIS

I can hear it.

SAMANTHA

I don't hear anything.

CURTIS

Put your hand on the door. You can

feel it.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

(signing and speaking)

Thunder? Do you feel it?

87.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

(signing and speaking)

You feel it? You feel it?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.

SAMANTHA

Baby, there's no storm outside.

CURTIS

I'm sorry.

SAMANTHA

Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We

love you very much. Please open

the door.

CURTIS

I'm sorry. I can't.

SAMANTHA

I love you, but if I open the door,

then nothin's gonna change. You'll

see that everything's fine, but

nothing will change. Please. This

is what it means to stay with us.

This is something you have to do.

CURTIS

Could you move Hannah back?

88.

CURTIS

It's fine.

PSYCHIATRIST

Do you have any vacation time that

you could use?

CURTIS

I don't have a job right now.

PSYCHIATRIST

Well, I know that times are hard,

but I think it's really important

for you to separate yourself from

that storm shelter.

(MORE)

89.

PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)

I think you need to break away from

it for awhile. We can start you on

some medication that I think will

help, but that action alone would

mean a lot.

SAMANTHA

We usually go on a trip to Myrtle

Beach every summer. We were gonns

go this month.

PSYCHIATRIST

I think that would be okay if we

start the medication now. It would

give you all some time to prepare

as a family, but I want to be

clear, when Curtis gets back he'll

need to take more time than that.

SAMANTHA

What does that mean?

PSYCHIATRIST

I mean that he'll need hands on

therapy at a real facility.

CURTIS

You mean I have to leave my family.

PSYCHIATRIST

I think you need to seriously

commit to some treatment.

CURTIS

(signing and speaking)

Hey. Good, huh?

90.

CURTIS

Good. We put a top on it.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

What is it honey?

CURTIS (CONT'D)

What?

91.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

Sam.

SAMANTHA

Okay.

THE END.
