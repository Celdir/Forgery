GREGORY

A dog of the house of Capulet moves

me!

GREGORY

A dog of that house shall move me

to stand. I will take the wall of

any man or maid of Capulets.

SAMPSON

That shows thee a weak slave. For

the weakest goes to the wall.

GREGORY

'Tis true; and therefore women,

being the weaker vessels, are ever

thrust to the wall. Therefore, I

will push Capulet's men from the

wall, and thrust his maids to the

wall.

BENVOLIO

The quarrel is between our masters...

GREGORY

(yelling after him)

...and us their men.

SAMPSON

I will show myself a tyrant. When

I have fought with the men I will

be civil with the maids, I will cut

off their heads.

GREGORY

The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON

Ay, the heads of the maids, or

their maiden heads, take it in what

sense thou wilt.

GREGORY

They must take it in sense that

feel it.

GREGORY/SAMPSON

(SINGING)

I am a pretty piece of flesh!

I am a pretty piece of flesh!

Me, they shall feel while I am able

to stand;

I am a pretty piece of flesh!

SAMPSON

Here comes of the House of Capulet.

GREGORY

Quarrel I will back thee.

SAMPSON

Let us take the law of our sides.

Let them begin.

SAMPSON

I will bite my thumb at them; which

is a disgrace to them if they bear

it.

ABRA

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRA

Do you bite you thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

(sweating, murmurs to Gregory)

Is the law on our side if I say "Ay"?

GREGORY

No.

SAMPSON

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at

you, sir - but I do bite my thumb,

sir!

GREGORY

Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRA

Quarrel sir, no sir.

SAMPSON

But if you do, sir, I am for you. I

serve as good a man as you.

ABRA

No better?

SAMPSON

Well sir...

GREGORY

Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

SAMPSON

YES SIR, BETTER!

ABRA

THOU LIEST!

ABRA

DRAW IF YOU BE MEN!

BENVOLIO

Part, fools! You know not what you

do!

BENVOLIO

Put up your swords!

TYBALT

What, art thou drawn amoung these

heartless hinds?

Turn thee Benvolio.

BENVOLIO

I do but keep the peace.

TYBALT

Peace? I hate the word

As I hate hell, all Montagues, and...

CAPULET

(to a waiter)

Give me my long sword!

MONTAGUE

What noise is this!

CAROLINE

Thou shalt not stir one foot to

seek a foe!

MONTAGUE

(shrugging her off)

Hold me not, let me go!

TYBALT

Look upon thy death, Benvolio.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

(over PA)

Rebellious subjects, enemies to

peace,

Throw your mistempered weapons to

the ground.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Throw your mistempered weapons to

the ground!

VOICE OVER

Two households, both alike in

dignity.

In fair Verona, where we lay our

SCENE

From ancient grudge break to new

mutiny,

Where civil blood makes civil hands

unclean.

From forth the fatal loins of these

two foes

A pair of star crossed lovers take

their life.

Whose misadventured piteous

OVERTHROWS

Doth with their death bury their

parents strife.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Three civil brawls, bred of an airy

WORD

By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,

Have thrice disturbed the quiet of

our streets.

LAWYER

My noble Prince I can...

CAPTAIN PRINCE

If ever you disturb our streets

again,

Your lives shall pay the forfeit of

the peace.

CAROLINE

O where is Romeo? Saw you him

today?

(pointedly to Montague)

Right glad I am he was not at this

fray.

BENVOLIO

Madam, underneath The Grove of

SYCAMORE

So early walking did I see your son.

MONTAGUE

Many a morning hath he there been

SEEN

With tears augmenting the fresh

morning's dew.

CAROLINE

Away from light steals home my

heavy son

And private in his chamber pens

himself,

Shuts up his windows, locks fair

daylight out

And makes himself an artificial

night.

MONTAGUE

Westward from this city side.

ROMEO (V/O)

Love is a smoke made with the fume

of sighs;

Being purged, a fire sparkling in

lovers' eyes;

Being vexed, a sea nourished with

lovers' tears.

What is it else? A madness most

discreet,

A choking gall and a preserving

sweet.

MONTAGUE

Black and portentous must this

humour prove

Unless good counsel may the cause

remove.

BENVOLIO

So please you step aside.

I'll know his grievance or be much

denied.

MONTAGUE

Come Madam. Let's away.

BENVOLIO

Good morrow, cousin.

ROMEO

Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO

But new struck, Coz.

ROMEO

Ay me! Sad hours seem long.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Was that my father that went hence

so fast?

BENVOLIO

(GUILTY)

It was.

BENVOLIO

What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO

Not having that which having makes

them short.

BENVOLIO

In love?

ROMEO

Out.

BENVOLIO

Of love?

ROMEO

Out of her favor where I am in love.

BENVOLIO

Alas that love, so gentle in his

view,

Should be so tyrannical and rough

in proof!

ROMEO

Alas that love, whose view...

ROMEO (CONT.)

What fray was here?

ROMEO (CONT.)

(ANGRILY)

Yet tell me not, for I have heard

it all.

Here's much to do with hate, but

more with love.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Why then, O brawling love, O loving

hate,

O anything, of nothing first

create!

O heavy lightness, serious vanity,

Misshapen chaos of well-seeming

forms,

Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold

fire, sick health,

Still-waking sleep, that is not

what it is!

ROMEO (CONT.)

This love feel I, that feel no love

in this!

ROMEO (CONT.)

Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO

No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO

Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO

Tell me in sadness, who is it that

you love.

ROMEO

In sadness, cousin, I do love...a

woman.

BENVOLIO

I aimed so near when I supposed you

loved.

ROMEO

A right good marksman; and she's

fair I love.

BENVOLIO

Rosaline!

(he is impressed)

A right fair mark, fair coz, is

soonest hit.

ROMEO

She'll not be hit with Cupid's

arrow.

She hath Dian's wit,

And in strong proof of chastity

lives well armed.

BENVOLIO

Then she hath sworn that she will

still live chaste?

ROMEO

She hath; and in that sparing makes

huge waste.

BENVOLIO

Be ruled by me; forget to think of

her.

ROMEO

O, teach me how I should forget to

think!

BENVOLIO

By giving liberty unto thine eyes.

Examine other beauties.

ROMEO

Farewell. Thou canst not teach me

to forget.

BENVOLIO

I'll pay that doctrine, or else die

in debt.

CAPULET

But Montague is bound as well as I,

In penalty alike;

CAPULET (CONT.)

And 'tis not hard, I think, for me

so old as we to keep the peace.

DAVE

Of honorable reckoning are you

both,

And pity 'tis you lived at odds so

long.

DAVE (CONT.)

But now, my lord, what say you to

my suit?

CAPULET

But saying o'er what I have said

BEFORE;

My child is yet a stranger in the

WORLD;

Let two more summers wither in

their pride,

Ere we may think her ripe to be a

bride.

DAVE

Younger than she are happy mothers

made.

CAPULET

(checking him hard)

And too soon marred are those so

early made.

Earth hath swallowed all my hopes

but she;

She is the hopeful lady of my earth.

CAPULET (CONT.)

But woo her, gentle Paris, get her

heart.

My will to her consent is but a

part,

And she agreed, within her scope of

CHOICE

Lies my consent and fair according

voice.

This night I hold an old Accustomed

feast.

CAPULET (CONT.)

At my poor house, look to behold

this night,

Fresh female buds that make dark

heaven light.

Hear all; all see,

And like her most whose merit most

shall be.

CAPULET (CONT.)

(a hearty slap)

Come go with me!

BENVOLIO

(chalking his cue)

Take thou some new infection to thy

eye.

BENVOLIO (CONT.)

And the rank poison of the old will

die.

BENVOLIO

Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO

Not mad, but bound more than a

madman is;

Shut up in prison, kept without my

food,

ROMEO (CONT.)

Whipped and tormented.

ROMEO

Good day, good fellow.

SUSAN

Now I'll tell you without asking.

The great

Rich Capulet, holds an old

accustomed feast;

RICH

A fair Assembly.

SUSAN

I Pray you sir can you read?

RICH

Signor Placentio and his wife and

daughters,

Signor Martino, the Lady Widow

Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces,

Rosaline and Livia...

BENVOLIO

At this same ancient feast of

CAPULET'S

Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou

so loves,

With all the admired beauties of

Verona.

Go thither, and with unattained eye

Compare her face with some that I

shall show,

And I will make thee think thy swan

a crow.

ROMEO

One fairer than my love?

ROMEO (CONT.)

The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her

match since first the world begun.

SUSAN

If you be not of the house of

Montagues,

Come and crush a cup of wine!

RICH

Rest you merry!

ROMEO

I'll go along, no such sight to be

shown.

But to rejoice in splendour of mine

own.

GLORIA (CONT.)

Nurse, where's my daughter? Call

her forth to me.

NURSE

I bade her come. God forbid!

Where's this girl?

Juliet!

JULIET

(COOLLY)

Madam, I am here. What is you will.

GLORIA

Nurse, give leave awhile, we must

talk in secret.

GLORIA (CONT.)

Nurse, come back again.

I have remembered me, thou's hear

our counsel.

GLORIA (CONT.)

Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's

of a pretty age.

NURSE

(to Juliet)

Thou wast the prettiest babe that

e'er I nursed.

GLORIA

By my count, I was your mother much

upon these years

That you are now a maid.

GLORIA (CONT.)

Thus then in brief, the valiant

Paris seeks you for his love.

NURSE

A man, young lady! Lady, such a

MAN

As all the world - why, he's a man

of wax.

GLORIA

Verona's summer hath not such a

flower.

NURSE

Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a

very flower.

GLORIA

This night you shall behold him at

our feast;

Read o'er the volume of young

Paris' face

And find delight writ there with

beauty's pen.

This precious book of love, this

unbound lover,

To beautify him only lacks a cover.

So shall you share all that he doth

possess,

By having him, making yourself no

less.

GLORIA

Can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET

I'll look to like, if looking

liking move,

But no more deep will I endart mine

eye,

Than your consent gives strength to

make it fly.

PETER

Madam. The guests are come.

GLORIA

(checks the mirror)

We follow thee.

NURSE

Go girl, seek happy nights to happy

days.

MERCUTIO

Strike drum!

MERCUTIO

We'll on without apology.

ROMEO

I am not for this ambling.

Being but heavy, I will bear the

light.

MERCUTIO

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you

dance.

ROMEO

Not I, believe me. You have

dancing shoes

With nimble soles. I have a soul

of lead.

MERCUTIO

Too great oppression for a tender

thing.

ROMEO

Is love a tender thing? It is too

rough, too rude, too boisterous,

and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO

If love be rough with you, be rough

with love.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Prick love for pricking, and you

beat love down.

ROMEO

Under love's heavy burden do I sink!

BENVOLIO

Every man betake him to his legs!

MERCUTIO

Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO

But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO

Why, may one ask?

ROMEO

I dreamt a dream tonight.

MERCUTIO

And so did I.

ROMEO

Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO

That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO

In bed asleep, while they do dream

things true.

MERCUTIO

O, then I see Queen Mab hath been

with you.

She is the fairies' midwife, and

she comes

In shape no bigger than an agate

STONE

On the forefinger of an alderman,

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Over men's noses as they lie asleep.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,

Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

And in this state she gallops night

by night

Through lovers' brains, and then

they dream of love;

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

O'er lawyers' fingers who straight

dream on fees;

O'er ladies' lips, who straight on

kisses dream,

Which oft the angry Mab with

blisters plagues.

Because their breaths with

sweetmeats tainted are.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Sometime she driveth o'er a

soldier's neck;

And then dreams he of cutting

foreign throats.

And being thus frighted, swears a

prayer or two

And sleeps again.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

This is that very Mab

That plaits the manes of horses in

the night

And bakes the elf-locks in foul

sluttish hairs

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

This is the hag, when maids lie on

their backs,

That presses them and learns them

first to bear,

Making them women of good carriage.

This is she, this is she...

ROMEO

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.

Thou talkest of nothing.

MERCUTIO

True, I talk of dreams;

Which are the children of an idle

brain,

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.

Which is as thin of substance as

the air

And more inconstant than the wind,

who woos

Even now the frozen bosom of the

NORTH

And, being angered, puffs away from

THENCE

Turning his attention to the dew-

dropping south.

BENVOLIO

This wind you talk of blows us from

OURSELVES:

Supper is done and we shall come

too late.

ROMEO

I fear, too early, for my mind

MISGIVES

Some consequence yet hanging in the

STARS

Shall bitterly begin his fearful

DATE

With this night's revels, and

expire the term

Of a despised life closed in my

breast,

By some vile forfeit of untimely

death.

ROMEO (CONT.)

But he that hath the steerage of my

COURSE

Direct my sail!

ROMEO (CONT.)

On, lusty gentlemen!

MERCUTIO

Everyman betake him to his legs!

CAPULET

Ah, I have seen the day that I

COULD

Tell a whispering tale in a fair

ladies ear.

Such as would please.

CAPULET (CONT.)

Come musicians play!

NURSE

Juliet, your mother calls.

DAVE

Will you now deny to dance?

GLORIA

(whispering to Juliet)

A man, young lady, such a man.

TYBALT

What, dares the slave come hither

to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Now by the stock and honor of my

KIN

To strike him dead I hold it not a

sin.

CAPULET

Why how now kinsman, wherefore

storm you so?

TYBALT

Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.

A Montague, our foe.

CAPULET

Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT

'Tis he.

CAPULET

Content thee gentle coz, let him

alone.

I would not for the wealth of all

this town

Here in my house do him

disparagement.

Therefore be patient; take no note

of him.

TYBALT

I'll not endure him.

CAPULET

He shall be endured!

(slapping Tybalt viciously)

What, goodman boy! I say he shall!

Go to.

CAPULET

You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

CAPULET

What? Cheerly my hearts!

CAPULET

You'll not endure him! Am I the

master here or you? Go to.

ROMEO

Did my heart love till now?

Forswear it, sight.

For I ne'er saw true beauty till

this night.

ROMEO

If I profane with my unworthiest

HAND

This holy shrine, the gentle sin is

this.

My lips, two blushing pilgrims,

ready stand

To smooth that rough touch with a

tender kiss.

JULIET

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your

hand too much,

Which mannerly devotion shows in

this.

For saints have hands that pilgrim's

hands do touch,

And palm to palm is holy palmers'

kiss.

ROMEO

Have not saints lips, and holy

palmers too?

JULIET

(a gentle scolding)

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must

use in prayer.

ROMEO

O, then, dear saint, let lips do

what hands do,

They pray: grant thou, lest faith

turn to despair.

JULIET

Saints do not move, though grant

for prayer's sake.

ROMEO

Then move not while my prayer's

effect I take.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Thus from my lips, by thine my sin

is purged.

JULIET

Then have my lips the sin that they

have took.

ROMEO

Sin from my lips? O trespass

sweetly urged!

Give me my sin again.

JULIET

You kiss by th' book.

NURSE

Madam, your mother craves a word

with you.

NURSE (CONT.)

Come, let's away.

ROMEO

(under his breath)

Is she a Capulet?

NURSE

His name is Romeo, and a Montague,

The only son of your great enemy.

MERCUTIO

Away, begone, the sport is at its

best.

ROMEO

Ay so I fear,

ROMEO (CONT.)

The more is my unrest.

JULIET

My only love, sprung from my only

hate.

Too early seen unknown, and known

too late.

Prodigious birth of love it is to me

JULIET (CONT.)(V/O)

That I must love a loathed enemy.

TYBALT

I will withdraw. But this intrusion

shall,

Now seeming sweet, convert to

bitterest gall.

BOYS

"I am a pretty piece of flesh,

I am a pretty piece of flesh..."

ROMEO

Can I go forward when my heart is

here?

Turn back, dull earth, and find thy

centre out.

BENVOLIO

Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!

BENVOLIO

He ran this way. Call, good

Mercutio.

MERCUTIO

Nay, I'll conjure too.

MERCUTIO

Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion!

Lover!

I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright

eyes,

By her high forehead and her

scarlet lip,

By her fine foot, straight leg, and

quivering thigh.

And the demesnes that there adjacent

lie,

That in thy likeness thou appear to

us!

ROMEO

He jests at scars that never felt a

wound.

MERCUTIO

O Romeo, that she were, O that she

WERE

An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Come, shall we go?

ROMEO

But soft, what light through yonder

window breaks?

ROMEO

It is the East, and Juliet is the

sun!

Arise, fair sun, and kill the

envious moon,

Who is already sick and pale with

GRIEF

That thou her maid art far more

fair than she.

Be not her maid, since she is

envious.

Her vestal livery is but sick and

green,

And none but fools do wear it.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Cast it off!

ROMEO (CONT.)

It is my lady. O, it is my love!

O that she knew she were!

JULIET

Ay me!

ROMEO

(WHISPERS)

She speaks.

O, speak again, bright angel!

JULIET

O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou

Romeo?

Deny thy father and refuse thy

name.

Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn

my love,

And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO

Shall I hear more, or shall I speak

at this?

JULIET

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

Thou are thyself, though not a

Montague.

What's Montague? It is not hand

nor foot

Nor arm nor face nor any other part

Belonging to a man. O, be some

other name!

What's in a name?

That which we call a rose

By any other word would smell as

sweet.

So Romeo would, were he not Romeo

called,

Retain that dear perfection which

he owes

Without that title. Romeo, doff

thy name,

And for thy name, which is no part

of thee,

Take all myself.

ROMEO

I take thee at thy word!

Call me but love, and I'll be new

baptised.

Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET

What man art thou that, thus

bescreened in night,

So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO

By a name I know not how to tell

thee who I am:

My name, dear saint, is hateful to

MYSELF

Because it is an enemy to thee.

JULIET

Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

ROMEO

Neither, fair maid, if either thee

dislike.

JULIET

How cam'st thou hither, tell me,

and whyfore?

The garden walls are high and hard

to climb,

And the place death, considering

who thou art.

ROMEO

(with splashy bravado)

With love's light wings did I o'er

perch these walls.

For stony limits cannot hold love

out,

And what love can do, that dares

love attempt.

Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop

to me.

JULIET

(a real fear)

If they do see thee, they will

murder thee.

ROMEO

I have night's cloak to hide me

from their eyes.

And but thou love me, let them find

me here.

My life were better ended by their

HATE

Than death prorogued, wanting of

thy love.

JULIET

Thou knowest the mask of night is

on my face,

Else would a maiden blush bepaint

my cheek,

For that which thou hast heard me

speak tonight.

Fain would I dwell on form - fain,

fain deny

What I have spoke. But farewell

compliment!

Dost thou love me?

JULIET (CONT.)

I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I

will take thy word. Yet, if thou

swearest,

Thou mayst prove false. O gentle

Romeo,

If thou dost love, pronounce it

faithfully.

Or if thou think'st I am too

quickly won,

I'll frown, and be perverse, and

say thee nay,

So thou wilt woo. But else, not

for the world.

In truth, fair Montague, I am too

fond,

And therefore thou mayst think my

'haviour light.

But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove

more true

Than those that have more cunning

to be strange.

ROMEO

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,

That tips with silver all these

fruit-tree tops -

JULIET

O, swear not by the moon, th'

inconstant moon,

That monthly changes in her circled

orb,

Lest that thy love prove likewise

variable.

ROMEO

What shall I swear by?

JULIET

Do not swear at all.

Or if thou wilt, swear by thy

gracious self,

Which is the god of my idolatry,

And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO

If my heart's dear love -

JULIET

Well, do not swear. Although I joy

in thee,

I have no joy of this contract

tonight.

It is too rash, too unadvised, too

SUDDEN;

Too like the lightning, which doth

cease to be

Ere one can say 'it lightens.'

Sweet, good night.

This bud of love, by summer's

ripening breath,

May prove a beauteous flower when

next we meet.

Good night, good night. As sweet

repose and rest

Come to thy heart as that within my

breast.

ROMEO

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

What satisfaction canst thou have

tonight?

ROMEO

The exchange of thy love's faithful

vow for mine.

JULIET

I gave thee mind before thou didst

request it!

JULIET (CONT.)

And yet I would it were to give

again.

ROMEO

Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what

purpose love?

JULIET

But to be frank and give it thee

again.

NURSE (O/S)

Juliet!

JULIET

(BREATHLESSLY)

Three words, dear Romeo, and good

night indeed.

If that thy bent of love be

honourable.

Thy purpose marriage, send me word

tomorrow,

By one that I'll procure to come to

thee,

Where and what time thou wilt

perform the rite,

And all my fortunes at thy foot

I'll lay

And follow thee my lord throughout

the world.

NURSE (O/S)

Madam!

JULIET

I come, anon - But if thou meanest

not well,

I do beseech thee...

NURSE (O/S)

Madam!

JULIET

(to Nurse)

By and by I come!

To cease thy strife and leave me to

my grief.

Tomorrow will I send.

ROMEO

So thrive my soul.

NURSE (O/S)

Madam!

JULIET

A thousand times good night!

ROMEO

A thousand times the worse, to want

thy light.

Love goes toward love as schoolboys

from their books;

But love from love, toward school

with heavy looks.

JULIET

Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow

Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO

By the hour of nine.

JULIET

I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year

till then.

Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is

such sweet sorrow.

That I shall say goodnight till it

be morrow.

ROMEO

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace

in thy breast,

Would I were sleep and peace, so

sweet to rest.

FATHER LAURENCE (O/S)

O mickle is the powerful grace that

LIES

In plants, herbs, stones, and their

true qualities.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Within the infant rind of this weak

FLOWER

Poison hath residence, and medicine

power.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

(to the boys)

For this, being smelt, with that

part cheers each part;

Being tasted, stays all senses with

the heart.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

For naught so vile on the earth

doth live,

But to the earth some special good

doth give;

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Nor aught so good but, strained

from that fair use,

Revolts from true birth, stumbling

on abuse.

FATHER LAURENCE

Two such opposed kings encamp them

STILL

In man as well as herbs: grace and

rude will;

And where the worser is predominant,

Full soon the canker death eats up

that plant.

ROMEO (O/S)

Good morrow, father!

ROMEO

Good morrow, father!

FATHER LAURENCE

Benedicite!

What early tongue so sweet saluteth

me?

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Young son, it argues a distempered

HEAD

So soon to bid good morrow to thy

bed.

Or if not so, then here I hit it

right -

Our Romeo hath not been in bed

tonight.

ROMEO

The last is true. The sweeter rest

was mine.

FATHER LAURENCE

(he stops)

God pardon sin! Wast thou with

Rosaline?

ROMEO

With Rosaline, my ghostly father?

No.

I have forgot that name and that

name's woe.

FATHER LAURENCE

That's my good son! But where hast

thou been then?

ROMEO

I have been feasting with mine

enemy,

Where on a sudden one hath wounded

me.

That's by me wounded. Both our

REMEDIES

Within they help and holy physic

lies.

FATHER LAURENCE

(buttoning a long

black cassock)

Be plain, good son, and homely in

thy drift.

Riddling confession finds but

riddling shrift.

ROMEO

Then plainly know my heart's dear

love is set,

On the fair daughter of rich

Capulet.

We met, we wooed, and made exchange

of vow,

I'll tell thee as we pass. But

this I pray,

That thou consent to marry us today.

ALTAR BOYS

Good morrow, Romeo.

FATHER LAURENCE

Holy Saint Francis! What a change

is here!

Is Rosaline, that thou didst love

so dear,

So soon foresaken? Young men's

love then lies

Not truly in their hearts, but in

their eyes.

ROMEO

Thou chid'st me oft for loving

Rosaline.

FATHER LAURENCE

(very angry)

For doting, not for loving, pupil

mine.

ROMEO

I pray thee chide me not. Her I

love now

Doth grace for grace and love for

love allow.

The other did not so.

FATHER LAURENCE

O, she knew well

Thy love did read by rote, that

could not spell.

CHOIR

How can you just leave me standing

Alone in a world so cold,

Maybe I'm just too demanding,

Maybe I'm just like my father, too

bold,

Maybe you're just like my mother,

She's never satisfied.

Why do we scream at each other?

This is what it sounds like when

doves cry...

FATHER LAURENCE

But come, young waverer, come, go

with me.

In one respect I'll thy assistant

be.

For this alliance may so happy

PROVE

To turn your households' rancor to

pure love.

ROMEO

O, let us hence! I stand on sudden

haste.

FATHER LAURENCE

Wisely and slow. They stumble that

run fast.

MERCUTIO

Where the devil should this Romeo

be?

Came he not home tonight?

BENVOLIO

(slamming down the phone)

Not to his father's. I spoke with

his man.

MERCUTIO

Why, that same pale hard-hearted

wench, that Rosaline,

Torments him so that he will sure

run mad.

BENVOLIO

(running to keep up)

Tybalt hath sent a letter to his

father's house.

MERCUTIO

(halts abruptly)

A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO

Romeo will answer it?

MERCUTIO

Any man that can write may answer a

letter.

BENVOLIO

Nay, he will answer the letter's

master, how he dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO

Alas, poor Romeo, he is already

dead!

Stabbed with a white wench's black

eye,

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Run through the ear with a love

song.

(in disgust)

And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO

(struggling to break free)

Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO

(releasing him)

More than Prince of Cats, I can

tell you.

O, he's the courageous captain of

compliments.

The very butcher of a silk button.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

A duellist, a duellist.

BENVOLIO

Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

MERCUTIO

Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a

French salutation to your French

slop. You gave us the counterfeit

fairly last night.

ROMEO

Good morrow to you both. What

counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO

The slip, sir, the slip. Can you

not conceive?

ROMEO

Pardon, good Mercutio. My business

was great, and in such a case as

mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO

(SARCASTICALLY)

A most courteous exposition.

ROMEO

Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.

MERCUTIO

(CAMPLY)

Pink for flower?

ROMEO

I will bite thee on the ear for

that jest!

MERCUTIO

Come between us, good Benvolio! My

wits faint.

ROMEO

Switch and spurs, switch and spurs,

or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO

Why, is not this better now than

groaning for love?

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Now art thou sociable.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou...

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

(QUIETLY)

What thou art, by art as well as by

nature.

ROMEO

Here's goodly gear.

MERCUTIO

(BEMUSED)

God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.

NURSE

I desire some confidence with you.

MERCUTIO

A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

BENVOLIO

She will endite him to some supper?

MERCUTIO

(taken by surprise)

Romeo, will you come to your

father's?

We'll to dinner thither.

ROMEO

(as he closes the door)

I will follow you.

MERCUTIO

Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.

NURSE

If ye should lead her in a fool's

paradise, as they say, it were a

very gross kind of behavior, as

they say. For the gentlewoman is

young; and therefore, if you should

deal double with her, truly it were

an ill thing and very weak dealing.

ROMEO

Bid her to come to confession this

afternoon,

And there she shall at Friar

Laurence's cell

Be shrived and

(PUSH IN ON: Romeo)

married.

JULIET

O God she comes!

JULIET

O honey nurse, what news?

JULIET

Nurse!

NURSE

I am aweary, give me leave awhile.

Fie, how my bones ache. What a

jaunce have I.

JULIET

I would thou hadst my bones and I

thy news.

JULIET

Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;

GOOD

Nurse, speak.

NURSE

Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay

awhile?

Can you not see I am out of breath?

JULIET

How art thou out of breath when

thou hast breath

To say to me that thou art out of

breath!

Is the news good or bad? Answer to

that.

NURSE

Well, you have made a simple

choice.

You know not how to choose a man.

Romeo? No, not he.

Though his face be better than any

man's, yet his leg excels all men's

and for a hand and a foot and a

body, though they be not to be

talked on, yet they are past

compare.

He's not the flower of courtesy,

but I'll warrant him as gentle as a

lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve

God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET

No, no. But all this I did know

before. What says he of our

marriage? What of that

NURSE

Lord how my head aches! What a

head have I:

My back -

NURSE (CONT.)

o' t'other side - ah, my back!

Beshrew your heart for sending me

ABOUT

To catch my death with jauncing up

and down.

JULIET

I'faith I am sorry that thou art

not well.

Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,

what says my love?

NURSE

Your love says like an honest

gentleman,

And a courteous, and a kind, and a

handsome,

And I warrant a virtuous - Where is

your mother?

JULIET

Where is my mother? How oddly thou

repliest!

'Your love says, like an honest

gentleman, "Where is your mother"'!

NURSE

O God's lady dear are you so hot?

Henceforth do your messages yourself.

JULIET

Here's such a coil! COME WHAT SAYS

ROMEO?

NURSE

Have you got leave to go to

confession today?

JULIET

I have.

NURSE

Then hie you hence to Father

Laurence cell.

There stays a husband to make you a

wife!

FATHER LAURENCE

These violent delights have violent

ends!

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

The sweetest honey

Is loathsome in its own

deliciousness,

Therefore love moderately.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Long love doth so.

Too swift arrives as tardy as too

slow.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Here comes the lady.

JULIET

Good afternoon to my ghostly

confessor.

FATHER LAURENCE

(DRYLY)

Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,

for us both.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Come, come, and we will make short

work.

For, by your leaves, you shall not

stay alone

Till Holy Church incorporate two in

one.

BENVOLIO

I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's

retire.

The day is hot,

BENVOLIO (CONT.)

The Capels are abroad. And if we

meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.

MERCUTIO

Thou art like one of these fellows

that, when he enters the confines

of a tavern, claps me his sword

upon the table and says 'God send

me no need of thee!'

(he hands Benvolio

his gun)

and by the operation of the second

cup draws him on the drawer, when

indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO

By my head, here comes the Capulets.

MERCUTIO

By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT

Gentlemen, good day. A word with

one of you.

MERCUTIO

And but one word with one of us?

Couple it with something. Make it

a word and a...

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

...blow.

TYBALT

(FURIOUS)

You shall find me apt enough to

that, sir,

(clutching at his

side arm)

And you will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO

(a breathy, coquettish

VOICE)

Could you not take some occasion

without giving?

TYBALT

Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

MERCUTIO

Consort? What, dost thou make us

minstrels? And thou make minstrels

of us look to hear nothing but

discords. Here's my fiddlestick.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Here's that shall make you dance.

(barking at Tybalt)

Zounds,

(goading him to go

for his gun)

consort!

BENVOLIO

Either withdraw unto some private

place.

Or reason coldly of your grievances.

Here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO

Men's eyes were made to look, and

let them gaze.

I will not budge for no man's

pleasure, I.

TYBALT

Well sir, here comes my man.

TYBALT

Romeo, the love I bear thee can

AFFORD

No better term than this:

TYBALT (CONT.)

Thou art a villain!

ROMEO

Tybalt, the reason that I have to

love thee

Doth much excuse the appertaining

RAGE

To such a greeting: villain am I

none,

Therefore farewell. I see thou

knowest me not.

TYBALT

Boy, this shall not excuse the

INJURIES

That thou hast done me!

TYBALT

(YELLING)

Turn and draw.

ROMEO

I never injured thee,

And so, good Capulet, which name I

TENDER

As dearly as mine own...

ROMEO (CONT.)

...be satisfied.

MERCUTIO

O calm, dishonourable, vile

submission!

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Tybalt, you ratcatcher,

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Will you walk?

TYBALT

What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO

(AVOIDING)

Good King of Cats, nothing but one

of your nine lives.

TYBALT

I am for you.

ROMEO

Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

ABRA

Away Tybalt!

BENVOLIO

Art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO

Ay, ay, a scratch.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

A scratch!

ROMEO

Courage, man. The hurt cannot be

much.

MERCUTIO

'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow

and you shall find me a grave man.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

(through crazy laughter)

A plague o' both your houses!

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

Why the devil came you between us?

I was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO

I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO

A plague o' both your houses!

They have made worms' meat of me.

MERCUTIO (CONT.)

(a silent whisper)

Your houses!

BENVOLIO

Mercutio is dead!

ROMEO

Oh sweet Juliet,

Thy beauty hath made me effeminate

And in my temper softened valor's

steel!

ROMEO

Mercutio's soul

Is but a little way above our heads,

ROMEO (CONT.)

Staying for thine to keep him

company.

TYBALT

Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him

hence.

ROMEO

(with frightening intensity)

Either thou or I, or both, must go

with him.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Either thou or I, or both, must go

with him.

MERCUTIO (V/O)

Why the devil came you between us?

COP

(Romeo in his sights)

Put up thy weapon.

ROMEO

O, I am fortune's fool!

BALTHASAR

Romeo, away be gone! Stand not

amazed!

GLORIA

Tybalt!

GLORIA (CONT.)

Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's

child!

O, the blood is spilled of my dear

kinsman.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Where are the vile beginners of

this fray?

BENVOLIO

O noble Prince I can discover all

The unlucky manage of this fatal

brawl.

GLORIA

Prince as thou art true,

For blood of ours shed blood of

Montague!

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO

(pointing to Tybalt's corpse)

There lies the man, slain by young

Romeo,

That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.

GLORIA

He speaks not true! Affection

makes him false!

BENVOLIO

Romeo, that spoke him fair, could

not take

Truce with the unruly spleen of

TYBALT

Deaf to peace!

GLORIA

He is a kinsman to the Montague!

I beg for justice which thou Prince

must give.

Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not

live!

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.

Who now the price of his dear blood

doth owe?

MONTAGUE

Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's

friend; His fault concludes but

what the law should end,

The life of Tybalt.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

And for that offence

Immediately we do exile him.

MONTAGUE

Noble Prince...?

CAPTAIN PRINCE

I will be deaf to pleading and

EXCUSES;

Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase

out abuses.

Therefore use none.

CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)

Let Romeo hence in haste,

Else, when he is found that hour is

his last.

CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)

Bear hence this body and attend our

will.

Mercy but murders, pardoning those

that kill.

JULIET

Come gentle night, coming loving

black browed night,

Give me my Romeo. And when I shall

die,

Take him and cut him out in little

stars,

And he will make the face of heaven

so fine

That all the world will be in love

with night,

And pay no worship to the garish

sun.

O, I have bought the mansion of a

LOVE

But not possessed it, and though I

am sold,

Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is

this day

As is the night before some festival

To an impatient child that hath new

ROBES

And may not wear them.

JULIET

Oh God! Did Romeo's hand shed

Tybalt's blood?

NURSE

It did, it did! Alas the day, it

did!

JULIET

Oh serpent heart, hid with a

flowering face.

Was ever book containing such vile

MATTER

So fairly bound? O, that deceit

should dwell

In such a gorgeous palace!

NURSE

There's no trust, No faith, no

honesty in men. All perjured,

All forsworn, all naught, all

dissemblers.

Shame come to Romeo.

JULIET

Blistered be thy tongue

For such a wish! He was not born

to shame. Upon his brow shame is

ashamed to sit.

NURSE

Will you speak well of him that

killed your cousin?

JULIET

Shall I speak ill of him that is my

husband?

Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall

smooth thy name

When I, thy three-hours wife have

mangled it?

But whyfore, villain, didst thou

kill my cousin?

That villain cousin would have

killed my husband.

All this is comfort, wherefore weep

I then?

Some word there was worser than

Tybalt's death:

I would forget it fain - exiled.

Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled.

To speak that word is father,

mother,

Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain,

All dead.

JULIET (CONT.)

Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed,

And death, not Romeo, take my

maidenhead.

NURSE

Hie to your chamber. I'll find

ROMEO

To comfort you. I know well where

he is.

Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at

night.

JULIET

O find him, give this ring to my

true knight,

And bid him come to take his last

farewell.

ROMEO

Nurse!

NURSE

Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end

of all.

ROMEO

Speakest thou of Juliet?

Where is she? And how doth she?

And what says

My concealed lady to our cancelled

love?

NURSE

O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps

and weeps,

And then on Romeo cries, and then

falls down again.

ROMEO

As if that name,

Shot from the deadly level of a

gun,

Did murder her, as that name's

cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

FATHER LAURENCE

I thought thy disposition better

tempered!

Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou

happy.

The law that threatened death

becomes thy friend

And turns it to exile. There art

thou happy.

A pack of blessings light upon thy

back.

NURSE

Here sir, a ring my lady bid me

give you.

ROMEO

How well my comfort is revived by

this.

FATHER LAURENCE

Go, get thee to thy love, as was

decreed.

Ascend her chamber. Hence and

comfort her.

But look thou stay not till the

Watch be set,

For then thou canst not pass to

Mantua where thou shalt live till

we can find a time

To blaze your marriage, reconcile

your friends,

Beg pardon of the Prince and call

thee back,

With twenty hundred thousand times

more joy

Than thou wentst forth in

lamentation.

FATHER LAURENCE

Go hence. Be gone by the break of

DAY

Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand.

ROMEO

Farewell.

GLORIA

She'll not come down tonight.

DAVE

These times of woe afford no times

to woo.

CAPULET

Look you, she loved her kinsman

Tybalt dearly.

GLORIA

(JOINING)

And so did I.

CAPULET

(a cold glance at Gloria)

Well, we were born to die.

GLORIA

I'll know her mind early tomorrow.

Tonight she's mewed up to her

heaviness.

CAPULET

We'll keep no great ado - a friend

or two.

For, hark you, Tybalt being slain

so late,

It may be thought we held him

carelessly,

Being our kinsman if we revel

much -

But soft what day is this?

DAVE

Monday my lord.

CAPULET

Well Wednesday is too soon - what

say you to Thursday?

DAVE

My lord I...

CAPULET

(leaning close)

I will make a desperate tender of

my child's love.

(a drunken good humour)

I think she will be ruled in all

respects by me;

(exploding with

hearty laughter)

Nay, more, I doubt it not!

CAPULET

(to Dave)

But what say you to Thursday?

DAVE

My lord I...

DAVE (CONT.)

I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

CAPULET

A Thursday let it be then!

CAPULET

Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go

to bed.

Tell her, a Thursday she shall be

MARRIED

To this noble sir!

JULIET

Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet

near day.

ROMEO

I must be gone and live, or stay

and die.

JULIET

Yond light is not daylight,

JULIET (CONT.)

I know it, I

It is some meteor that the sun

EXHALES

To light thee on thy way to Mantua.

Therefore stay yet. Thou needest

not to be gone.

ROMEO

Let me be taken, let me be put to

death.

I have more care to stay than will

to go.

Come, death, and welcome! Juliet

wills it so.

ROMEO (CONT.)

How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It

is not day.

JULIET

It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone,

away!

O, now be gone! More light and

light it grows.

ROMEO

More light and light: more dark and

dark our woes.

NURSE (O/S)

Madam!

JULIET

Nurse!

NURSE (O/S)

Your lady mother is coming to your

chamber.

JULIET

Then, window, let day in, and let

life out.

ROMEO

Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and

I'll descend.

JULIET

O, think'st thou we shall ever meet

again?

ROMEO

I doubt it not;

JULIET

O God, I have an ill-divining soul.

Methinks I see thee, now thou art

so low,

As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

ROMEO

Trust me, love, all these woes

shall serve

For sweet discourses in our times

to come.

GLORIA

Ho daughter! Are you up?

GLORIA

Well, well.

ROMEO

Adieu, adieu!

JULIET

O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle,

Fortune,

Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep

him long

But send him back.

GLORIA

Thou hast a careful father, child:

One who, to put thee from thy

heaviness,

Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy

That thou expects not nor I looked

not for.

JULIET

Madam, in happy time. What day is

that?

GLORIA

Marry, my child, early next Thursday

MORN

The gallant, young, and noble

gentleman,

Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,

Shall happily make thee there a

joyful bride.

JULIET

Now by Saint Peter's Church, and

Peter too,

He shall not make me there a joyful

bride!

GLORIA

Here comes your father. Tell him

so yourself.

CAPULET

How now, wife?

Have you delivered to her our decree?

GLORIA

Ay, sir. But she will none, she

gives you thanks.

I would the fool were married to

her grave!

CAPULET

How? Will she none?

Is she not proud? Doth she not

count her blest,

Unworthy as she is, that we have

WROUGHT

So worthy a gentleman to be her

bride?

JULIET

Not proud you have, but thankful

that you have.

Proud can I never be of what I hate.

CAPULET

Thank me no thankings, nor proud me

no prouds,

But fettle your fine joints 'gainst

Thursday next ...

JULIET

Hear me with patience but to speak

a word...

CAPULET

Speak not, reply not, do not answer

me!

GLORIA

(SCREAMING)

Fie, fie! What are you mad?

CAPULET

Hang thee, young baggage!

Disobedient wretch.

NURSE

God in heaven bless her!

You are to blame, my lord, to rate

her so.

CAPULET

Peace, you mumbling fool!

CAPULET (CONT.)

I tell thee what - get thee to

church a Thursday

Or never after look me in the face.

And you be mine, I'll give you to

my friend.

And you be not, hang, beg, starve,

die in the streets,

Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll

not be forsworn.

JULIET

O sweet my mother, cast me not

away!

Delay this marriage for a month, a

week.

Or if you do not, make the bridal

BED

In that dim monument where Tybalt

lies.

GLORIA

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak

a word.

Do as thou wilt, for I have done

with thee.

JULIET

O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be

prevented?

JULIET (CONT.)

What sayest thou? Hast thou not a

word of joy?

Some comfort, Nurse.

NURSE

Faith, here it is.

I think it best you married with

this Paris.

O, he's a lovely gentleman!

I think you are happy in this

second match,

For it excels your first; or if it

did not,

Your first is dead - or 'twere as

good he were

As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET

Speakest thou from thy heart?

NURSE

And from my soul too. Else beshrew

them both.

JULIET

Amen.

NURSE

(UNSURE)

What?

JULIET

Well, thou hast comforted me

marvellous much.

Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,

Having displeased my father, to

Friar Laurence,

To make confession and to be

absolved.

NURSE

This is wisely done.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVE (O/S)

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's

death...

DAVE (CONT.)

...Now, sir, her father counts it

DANGEROUS

That she doth give her sorrow so

much sway,

And in his wisdom hastes our

MARRIAGE

To stop the inundation of her

tears...

DAVE

Happily met, my lady and my wife.

JULIET

That may be, sir, when I may be a

wife.

DAVE

That 'may be', must be, love, on

Thursday next.

JULIET

What must be, shall be.

FATHER LAURENCE

That's a certain text.

DAVE

Come you to make confession?

JULIET

Are you at leisure, holy father,

now?

Or shall I come to you at evening

mass?

FATHER LAURENCE

My leisure serves me, pensive

daughter, now.

(to Dave)

We must entreat the time alone.

DAVE

God shield I should disturb

devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday

early will I rouse ye;

DAVE (CONT.)

Till then, adieu, and keep this

holy kiss.

FATHER LAURENCE

O Juliet, I already know thy grief.

JULIET

Tell me not, Father, that thou

hearest of this,

Unless thou tell me how I may

prevent it.

FATHER LAURENCE

It strains me past the compass of

my wits.

JULIET

(DESPERATELY)

If in thy wisdom thou canst give no

HELP

Do thou but call my resolution

wise,

And with this I'll help it presently!

FATHER LAURENCE

Hold daughter!

JULIET

(through tears)

Be not so long to speak. I lone to

die!

FATHER LAURENCE

I do spy a kind of hope,

Which craves as desperate an

EXECUTION

As that is desperate which we would

prevent.

If, rather than marry Paris,

Thou hast the strength of will to

slay thyself,

Then it is likely thou wilt

UNDERTAKE

A thing like death...

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

to chide away this shame...

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

No warmth, no breath shall testify

thou livest.

Each part, deprived of supple

government,

Shall stiff and stark and cold

appear, like death.

Now when the bridegroom in the

MORNING

Comes to rouse thee from thy bed,

there art thou, dead.

Thou shalt be borne to that same

ancient vault

Where all the kindred of the

Capulets lie.

In the meantime, against thou shalt

awake,

Shall Romeo by my letters know our

drift,

And hither shall he come.

And that very

Night shall Romeo bear thee hence

to Mantua.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Take thou this vial, being then in

bed,

And this distilling liquor drink

thou off.

I'll send my letters to thy lord

with speed to Mantua.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIET

(DISINTERESTED)

Ay, these attires are best.

JULIET

But, gentle Nurse,

I pray thee leave me to myself

tonight.

NURSE

Why Bride?

JULIET

(almost in tears)

To move the heavens to smile upon

my state,

Which, well thou knowest, is cross

and full of sin.

JULIET

(WHISPERS)

What if this mixture do not work at

all?

Shall I be married then tomorrow

morning?

GLORIA

What, are you busy, ho? Need you

my help?

JULIET

(makes light of it)

No, madam. We have culled such

NECESSARIES

As are behoveful for our state

tomorrow.

So please you, let me now be left

alone,

And let the Nurse this night sit up

with you.

JULIET (CONT.)

For I am sure you have your hands

full all

In this so sudden business.

GLORIA

Good night.

GLORIA (CONT.)

Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou

hast need.

JULIET

Farewell!

JULIET (CONT.)

God knows when we shall meet again.

JULIET

I have a faint cold fear thrills

through my veins

That almost freezes up the heat of

life.

JULIET (CONT.)

Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO)

Mortal drugs?

MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO)

Of lethal quantity as 'twould

render death.

FATHER LAURENCE

(to the man in black)

As the custom is,

In all her best array bear her to

church.

UNDERTAKER

She shall be borne to that same

ancient vault

Where all the kindred of the

Capulets lie.

ROMEO (V/O)

If I may trust the flattering truth

of sleep

My dreams presage some joyful news

at hand...

ROMEO (V/O)

And all this day an unaccustomed

SPIRIT

Lifts me above the ground with

cheerful thoughts.

I dreamt my lady came and found me

DEAD

And breathed such life with kisses

in my lips

That I revived and was an emperor.

Ah me, how sweet is love itself

POSSESSED

When but love's shadows are so rich

in joy.

ROMEO

News from Verona!

ROMEO

How now, Balthasar?

ROMEO (CONT.)

Dost thou not bring me letters from

the Priest?

How doth my lady? Is my father

well?

How doth my lady Juliet? That I

ask again,

For nothing can be ill if she be

well.

BALTHASAR

Then she is well and nothing can be

ill.

Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,

And her immortal part with angels

lives.

I saw her laid low in her kindred's

vault.

ROMEO

Is it e'en so?

ROMEO

Then I defy you stars.

ROMEO

I will hence tonight.

BALTHASAR

Have patience...

ROMEO

Leave me!

BALTHASAR

Your looks are pale and wild and do

IMPORT

Some misadventure.

ROMEO

(with cold serenity)

Tush, thou art deceived.

(a niggling thought)

Hast thou no letters to me from the

Priest?

ROMEO

No matter - I will hence tonight.

ROMEO

Well Juliet, I will lie with thee

tonight.

ROMEO

Let me have

A dram of poison, such soon-

speeding gear

As will disperse itself through all

the veins

That the life-weary taker may fall

dead.

APOTHECARY

Such mortal drugs I have, but

Verona's law

Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO

The world is not thy friend, nor

the world's law.

Then be not poor, but break it and

take this.

APOTHECARY

My poverty, but not my will consents.

ROMEO

I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

FATHER LAURENCE

Who bore my letter then to Romeo?

CLERK

I could not sent it - here it is

again.

FATHER LAURENCE

By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!

The letter was of dear import.

(PAUSE: the priest listens)

Adieu.

FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)

Now must I to the monument alone.

Within this hour will fair Juliet

awake.

APOTHECARY

Drink it off and if you had the

strength of twenty men it would

dispatch you straight.

ROMEO

There is my gold - worse poison to

men's souls

Than these poor compounds that thou

mayst not sell.

COP

This is that banished haughty

Montague.

ROMEO

Upon thy life, whatever thou

HEAREST

Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me

the light -

BALTHASAR

I do beseech you...

ROMEO

Do not interrupt me in my course or

By heaven I will tear thee joint by

JOINT

And strew this hungry churchyard

with thy limbs!

ROMEO (CONT.)

The time and my intents are savage

wild,

More fierce and more inexorable far

Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR

I will be gone and not trouble ye.

ROMEO

So shalt thou show me friendship.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Live, and be prosperous; and

farewell, good fellow.

ROMEO

Thou detestable maw, thou womb of

death,

Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to

open.

ROMEO

In despite I'll cram thee with more

food.

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Hold! Hold!

ROMEO

Stand all aloof!

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Romeo, come forth, come forth.

ROMEO

Tempt not a desperate man!

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Bring forth these enemies Montague

and Capulet.

FATHER LAURENCE

Saint Francis be my speed tonight!

FATHER LAURENCE

Fear comes upon me.

O, much I fear some ill unthrifty

thing.

ROMEO

O my love, my wife,

Death, that hath sucked the honey

of thy breath,

Hath had no power yet upon thy

beauty,

Thou art not conquered. Beauty's

ensign yet

Is crimson in thy lips and in thy

cheeks,

And death's pale flag is not

advanced there.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet

so fair?

Shall I believe that unsubstantial

DEATH

Is amorous and keeps thee here in

DARK

To be his paramour? For fear of

THAT

I still will stay with thee. Here,

oh here

Will I set up my everlasting rest

And shake the yoke of inauspicious

STARS

From this world-wearied flesh.

ROMEO (CONT.)

Eyes, look your last.

Arms, take your last embrace. And,

lips, O you

The doors of breath, seal with a

righteous kiss...

ROMEO (CONT.)

A dateless bargain to engrossing

death.

ROMEO (CONT.)

(fighting for breath)

O true apothecary, thy drugs are

quick.

JULIET

Oh Romeo, what's here?

JULIET (CONT.)

Drunk all, and left

No friendly drop to help me after.

I will kiss thy lips.

Haply some poison yet doth hang on

THEM

To make me die with a restorative.

JULIET (CONT.)

(a heart-broken whisper)

Thy lips are warm.

ROMEO

Thus with a kiss I die.

JULIET

Romeo. O' my true love Romeo.

FATHER LAURENCE

Balthasar?

BALTHASAR

(DESPERATELY)

I brought news of Juliet's death...

And then in post came Romeo from

MANTUA

To this same place... to this same

monument.

FATHER LAURENCE

How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR

Full half an hour.

FATHER LAURENCE

Romeo.

(a shock of realisation)

The lady stirs...

CAPTAIN PRINCE

Hold! Go not forth!

FATHER LAURENCE

The lady stirs!

CAPTAIN PRINCE

See what a scourge is laid upon

your hate,

That heaven finds means to kill

your joys with love;

And I, for winking at your discords

too,

Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All

are punished.

ANCHOR WOMAN

(to camera)

A glooming peace this morning with

it brings:

The sun for sorrow will not show

his head.

Go hence, to have more talk of

these sad things.

Some shall be pardoned, and some

punished,

For never was a story of more woe

Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
