THE FAULT IN OUR STARS

FIRST DRAFT

HAZEL (V.O.)

You have a choice in this world, I

believe, about how to tell sad

stories.

HAZEL (V.O.)

On the one hand, you can sugar coat

- the way they do in movies and

romance novels.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Where villains are vanquished

and... heroes are born and...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... beautiful people learn

beautiful lessons...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... and nothing is too messed up

that can't be fixed with an apology

and a Peter Gabriel song.

HAZEL (V.O.)

I like that way as much as the next

girl, believe me. It's just not the

truth.

HAZEL (V.O.)

This is the truth.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Sorry.

FADE IN ON:

2.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Late in the Winter of my 17th

year...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... my mother decided I was

depressed.

HAZEL

I'm not depressed.

FRANNIE

... she eats like a bird. She

barely leaves the house,

HAZEL

I'm not depressed.

FRANNIE

... she reads the same book over

and over...

DOCTOR

She's depressed.

HAZEL

I'm not depressed!

HAZEL (V.O.)

The booklets and web sites always

list depression as a side effect of

cancer...

3.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Depression's not a side effect of

cancer...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... it's a side effect of dying.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Which is what was happening to me.

FRANNIE

... some days she won't even get

out of bed.

DOCTOR

I may switch you to Zoloft. Or

Lexapro. And twice a day instead of

once.

HAZEL

Why stop there?

DOCTOR

Hmm?

HAZEL

Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm

like the Keith Richards of cancer

kids.

DOCTOR

Have you been going to that Support

Group I suggested?

4.

FRANNIE

She's gone a few times.

HAZEL

I'm not sure it's for me.

DOCTOR

If you're depressed --

HAZEL

(EXASPERATED)

I'm not de--

DOCTOR

(IGNORING HER)

-- support Groups are a great way

to connect with people who are...

HAZEL

What?

DOCTOR

(BEAT)

On the same journey.

HAZEL

"Journey?" Really?

FRANNIE

Hazel.

DOCTOR

Just give it a chance, ok? For me.

DOCTOR

Who knows? You might even find

it... enlightening.

SMASH CUT TO:

PATRICK

... we are gathered here today -

literally - in the heart of Jesus.

PATRICK

Who would like to share their story

with the group?

5.

SPEAKER #1

Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.

SPEAKER #2

Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.

PATRICK

Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started

a few years ago, when I was...

HAZEL (V.O.)

I'll spare you the gory details of

Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,

they found it in his nuts, cut most

of it out, he almost died, but he

didn't die, and now here he is -

divorced, friendless, addicted to

video games, exploiting his

cancertastic past in the heart of

Jesus - "literally" - to show us

that one day - if we're lucky - we

could be just like him.

ALL IN UNISON

"We're here for you Patrick."

PATRICK

Who else would like to share?

(NO RESPONSE)

Hazel?

HAZEL

I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.

(BEAT)

Thyroid originally but with quite

the impressive satellite colony in

my lungs.

PATRICK

And how are you doing Hazel?

HAZEL (V.O.)

You mean besides the terminal

cancer?

6.

HAZEL

Alright? I guess...?

ALL IN UNISON

"We're here for you Hazel."

PATRICK

Maybe now I'll play a song...

FRANNIE

It's Friday night.

HAZEL

Hmm?

FRANNIE

I was just thinking... you should

call your friends, see what they're

up to.

HAZEL

(DISINTERESTED)

That's ok.

MICHAEL

Wanna see a movie?

HAZEL

Why don't you guys go to a movie?

(off their look)

(MORE)

7.

HAZEL (CONT'D)

You haven't been out in a while.

Go. Have fun. Take the night off.

MICHAEL

This is a really good show.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And that was my life.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Reality shows. Doctor's

appointments. Eight prescription

drugs, three times a day.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And worse worse worst of all...

support group.

HAZEL

Ugh. You can't make me.

MICHAEL

Of course we can, we're your

parents.

MICHAEL

Hazel, you need to get out of the

house. Make friends. Be a teenager.

HAZEL

If you want me to be a teenager,

don't send me to Support Group. Buy

me a fake ID so I can go to clubs

and drink gimlets and take pot.

MICHAEL

You don't take pot.

8.

HAZEL

See, that's the kind of thing I

would know with a fake ID.

FRANNIE

(BEAT)

Get in the car.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And so I went...

HAZEL (V.O.)

Not because I wanted to or because

I thought it would help. But for

the same reason I did anything

these days...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... to make my parents happy.

HAZEL

Are you gonna sit here and wait the

whole time?

FRANNIE

Of course not, no. I...

(she totally is)

I have errands to run.

HAZEL

Ok.

FRANNIE

Love you.

HAZEL

Love you too Mom.

HAZEL (V.O.)

The only thing worse than biting it

from cancer - is having a kid bite

it from cancer.

9.

FRANNIE

Make some friends!

HAZEL

I'll take the stairs.

GUS HAZEL

GUS HAZEL

HAZEL

Excuse me.

PATRICK

Who would like to begin?

10.

PATRICK

Isaac, I know you're facing a

challenging time. Perhaps you would

like to say something...

ISAAC

Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye

cancer.

(BEAT)

It's looking like another surgery

in a couple weeks. After which,

well, I'll be blind...

ISAAC

Not that I'm complaining or

anything. I know a lot of you have

it way worse but, still, I mean,

you know, being blind's gonna

suck...

ISAAC

...My girlfriend helps. And friends

like Augustus here...

ISAAC

So... yeah. That's what's up.

ALL IN UNISON

"We're here for you Isaac."

PATRICK

And does your friend want to speak?

GUS

Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a

touch of osteosarcoma bout a year

and a half ago - lost this baby as

a result...

11.

GUS

But really I'm just here at Isaac's

request.

PATRICK

And how are you feeling Augustus?

GUS

Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller

coaster that only goes up, my

friend.

PATRICK

Perhaps you'd like to share your

fears with the group, Augustus.

GUS

My fears?

GUS

Oblivion.

PATRICK

Oblivion?

GUS

Yeah, see... I intend to live an

extraordinary life. To be

remembered. If I'm scared of

anything it's... not doing that.

PATRICK

Would, uh, anyone like to speak to

that?

PATRICK

Hazel! That's unexpected.

HAZEL

I just wanna say... there will come

a time when, you know, all of us

are dead.

12.

HAZEL

It might be tomorrow. Might be a

million years from now but... it's

gonna happen. And when it does,

enough generations will come and

go, there'll be no one left to

remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or

Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,

right?

HAZEL

Oblivion's inevitable. And if that

scares you, well, I suggest you

ignore it. God knows it's what

everyone else does.

ISAAC MONICA

GUS

Literally.

GUS

I thought we were in a church

basement but apparently we were

literally in the heart of Jesus.

HAZEL

Someone should probably tell him,

don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda

dangerous keeping all these kids

with cancer in your heart.

GUS

What's your name?

13.

HAZEL

Hazel.

GUS

No your full name?

HAZEL

(CONFUSED)

Hazel Grace Lancaster.

HAZEL

What?

GUS

I didn't say anything.

HAZEL

Why are you looking at me like

that?

GUS

Because you're beautiful.

GUS

I enjoy looking at beautiful people

and I decided a while back not to

deny myself the simpler pleasures

of existence. Particularly given

that, as you so astutely pointed

out, we're all gonna die pretty

soon.

HAZEL

(BEAT)

I'm not beaut --

YOUNG GIRL

Hey Gus.

GUS

Hey Alisa.

ISAAC MONICA

HAZEL

What's with the "always?"

14.

GUS

"Always" is their thing. They'll

"always" love each other and

whatnot. Must have texted "always"

to each other at least four million

times this year.

HAZEL

He's gotta be hurting her boob.

GUS

Let's watch a movie.

HAZEL

Oh. Um. Uh...

(yes!)

Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this

WEEK--

GUS

No I mean now.

HAZEL

What?

GUS

Hmm?

HAZEL

What do you mean "now?"

GUS

I've got a car.

HAZEL

You could be an axe murderer.

GUS

There is that possibility.

(BEAT)

Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.

HAZEL

Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're

kidding right?

(off his look)

You just ruined the whole thing!

15.

GUS

Whole thing?

HAZEL

What, you think that's cool? Oh you

idiot! There's always a hamartia,

isn't there? And yours is - even

though you had FREAKING CANCER you

give money to a corporation for the

chance to acquire EVEN MORE

CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so

well.

HAZEL

Let me tell you... not being able

to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.

GUS

Hamartia?

HAZEL

A fatal flaw.

GUS

They don't hurt you unless you

light them.

HAZEL

Sorry?

GUS

I've never lit one.

GUS

It's a metaphor. See? You put the

thing that kills you between your

teeth. But you don't give it the

power to do the killing.

HAZEL

Metaphor.

FRANNIE

Hi sweetheart. Ready for some

"Model?"

16.

HAZEL

Can't tonight.

(off her confused look)

I've made plans with Augustus

Waters.

GUS

I failed the test a couple times.

HAZEL

You don't say.

GUS

Most amputees can drive with no

problem but... yeah. Not me.

HAZEL

I'm surprised you have a license.

GUS

Tell me about it!

GUS

The fourth time I took the test...

it was going about how this is

going... and when it was over, the

instructor looks at me and goes,

"your driving, while unpleasant...

is not technically unsafe."

HAZEL

Aha. Cancer perk.

GUS

Total cancer perk.

GUS

So what happened to you?

17.

HAZEL

I was 13 when they found it.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Stage IV thyroid cancer.

HAZEL (V.O.)

I had surgery first.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Then Radiation...

HAZEL (V.O.)

Then Chemo...

HAZEL (V.O.)

All of which worked for a while.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And then stopped working.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And then my lungs started filling

up with water.

HAZEL (V.O.)

That should have been the end.

18.

FRANNIE

(through the tears)

Are you ready, sweetie?

HAZEL (V.O.)

But it wasn't.

HAZEL (V.O.)

The antibiotics kicked in. They

drained the fluid from my lungs.

And in time I got better. Stronger.

HAZEL (V.O.)

I even found myself in an

experimental trial. You know the

ones that are famous in the

Republic of Cancervania for not

working.

HAZEL (V.O.)

It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't

work in over 70 percent of patients

but, for some reason...

HAZEL (V.O.)

...it worked in me. They called it

"The Miracle."

HAZEL

Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly

grown since...

(MORE)

19.

HAZEL (CONT'D)

Of course my lungs still suck but,

theoretically, they could continue

to suck in just this way for, I

dunno, a while maybe.

GUS

Wow.

HAZEL

Yeah.

GUS

So are you back in school or...?

HAZEL

Can't.

GUS

Why not?

HAZEL

Got my GED.

GUS

A college girl! Well that explains

the aura of sophistication...

GUS

We're here.

GUS

My parents call them

"encouragements."

(rolling his eyes)

Don't ask.

GUS

Hey guys.

GUS'S MOM

Augustus, hi. New friend?

20.

GUS

This is Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

It's just... Hazel.

GUS'S DAD

How's it going, Just Hazel?

GUS

(ABRUPTLY)

Downstairs if you need us!

HAZEL

Nice to meet you!

GUS

I used to play.

HAZEL

Must have been pretty good.

GUS

These are mine. And these. The rest

of it's just cancer perks.

HAZEL

Need to sit.

HAZEL

Don't get any ideas.

(catching her breath)

All that standing... and stairs...

and then more standing... lotta

standing for me.

GUS

I understand.

21.

HAZEL

I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I

faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian

lady, fainting-wise.

GUS

You ok?

GUS

So what's your story?

HAZEL

I already told you my story. I was

DIAGNOSED --

GUS

Not your cancer story. Your story.

Interests, hobbies, passions, weird

fetishes...

HAZEL

Um...

GUS

Don't tell me you're one of those

people who becomes their disease.

HAZEL

No. I'm just... I don't know... un-

extraordinary.

GUS

I reject that out of hand.

(beat, Hazel shrugs)

Think of something you love. First

thing that comes to mind.

HAZEL

"An Imperial Affliction."

GUS

Ok. What's that?

HAZEL

It's a novel. My favorite novel.

GUS

Does it have zombies?

HAZEL

(LAUGHING)

What? No.

GUS

Stormtroopers.

22.

HAZEL

Seriously?

(HE SHRUGS)

It's not that kind of book.

GUS

Sounds horrible.

HAZEL

It's not, it's... kind of my bible

actually.

GUS

Interesting. What's it about?

HAZEL

Cancer.

(off his look)

But not in that way, trust me. The

guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,

he's... well, the only person I've

ever come across who seems to a)

understand what it's like to be

dying and b) not have died.

GUS

(INTRIGUED)

In that case... I am going to read

this horrible book with the boring

title that does not contain zombies

or stormtroopers. And in

exchange...

GUS

... all I ask is that you read this

brilliant and haunting novelization

of my favorite video game.

GUS

Your hands are cold.

HAZEL

Not so much cold as under-

oxygenated.

GUS

Ooh Hazel Grace...

(BEAT)

I love it when you talk medical to

me.

23.

FRANNIE

That's different.

FRANNIE

Did he give it to you?

HAZEL

By "it" do you mean herpes?

FRANNIE

I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.

HAZEL

I'm not worried. Please. It's not

like I'm waiting for him to call or

anything. I just... we hung out. No

big deal.

24.

MICHAEL

Would you like to be excused?

GUS (O.S.)

Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

Welcome to the sweet torture of

reading "An Imperial --"

HAZEL

What the -- are you ok?

GUS (O.S.)

Me? Yeah. I'm excellent.

GUS

(INTO PHONE)

I am, however, with Isaac.

25.

GUS (O.S.)

(TO ISAAC)

Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel

make this better or worse?

GUS

Isaac! Focus. On. Me.

GUS (O.S.)

(TO HAZEL)

How fast can you get here?

GUS

(calling to Isaac)

Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is

coming downstairs.

GUS

A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the

midst of a psychotic episode.

(HAZEL NODS)

You look nice, by the way.

HAZEL

How ya doing Isaac?

GUS

Seems Isaac and Monica are no

longer a going concern.

HAZEL

Oh I'm sorry.

(BEAT)

Do you want to talk about it?

26.

GUS

He just wants to cry and play video

games.

HAZEL

Fair enough.

GUS

It doesn't hurt to talk to him,

however. If you have any sage words

of feminine advice...

HAZEL

I actually think his response is

appropriate.

GUS

"Pain demands to be felt."

HAZEL

(lights up at that)

You're quoting my book!

ISAAC

She didn't want to do it after the

surgery. Said she couldn't handle

it. I'm about to lose my eyesight

and she can't handle it.

ISAAC

I kept saying "always" to her.

Always, always, always. And she

just kept talking over me and not

saying it back. It was like I was

already gone, you know? "Always"

was a promise! You can't break

promises.

HAZEL

Sometimes people don't understand

the promises they're making when

they make them.

ISAAC

Right, sure, but you keep the

promise anyway. That's what love

is. Love is keeping the promise

anyway.

GUS

That could be an "encouragement."

27.

GUS

Isaac...?

GUS

Here we go...

GUS

That's it! Punch that thing.

GUS

I've been wanting to call you on a

nearly minutely basis but I have

been waiting until I could form a

coherent thought in re: "An

Imperial Affliction."

(SHE SMILES)

I can't stop thinking about it.

HAZEL

I know, right?

GUS

The only problem is the ending.

HAZEL

It is rather abrupt.

GUS

It's torture! I mean, I totally get

that she died or whatever - Anna.

But there is an unwritten contract

between author and reader and I

think ending your book in the

middle of a sentence kind of

violates that contract.

HAZEL

But that's part of what I like

about it. It portrays death

truthfully. You die in the middle

of your life, in the middle of a

sentence. But I do - God, I do want

to know what happens to everyone

else.

GUS

Yeah like her Mom.

HAZEL

The Dutch Tulip Man...

28.

GUS

Sysiphus the Hamster...

GUS

Have you tried contacting this...

Peter Van Houten?

HAZEL

I've written letters. He's never

responded. Apparently he moved to

Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't

published anything. Doesn't do

interviews.

GUS

Sad.

(BEAT)

Hang on.

(turns to Isaac)

Isaac!

GUS

Pillows don't break.

GUS

You need to break something.

GUS

Go to town, my friend.

GUS

I've been looking for a way to tell

my Dad that I kinda hate

basketball. Think maybe we've found

it.

GUS

Feel better?

29.

GUS

That's the thing about pain... it

demands to be felt.

FRANNIE

Dr. Maria called today. The PET

Scan is set for the eighth.

FRANNIE

I told you Support Group was a good

idea.

MICHAEL

By all means.

GUS

Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

Hello Augustus.

GUS

So I read it again. And I just kept

feeling like... like it was a gift.

Like you'd given me something

important.

HAZEL

(TOUCHED)

You're welcome.

GUS

On the other hand... we need

closure, don't we?

30.

HAZEL

What we need is a sequel.

GUS

Yes. We need to know what happens

to Anna's family after she dies.

HAZEL

That's what I kept asking Van

Houten for in my letters.

GUS

But he never wrote back.

HAZEL

That's correct.

GUS

Because he's a recluse.

HAZEL

Yeee-up.

GUS

Utterly unreachable.

HAZEL

Unfortunately so.

GUS

"Dear Mr. Waters... I am writing to

thank you for your electronic

correspondence received this 6th of

April.

GUS

"I am grateful to anyone who sets

aside the time to read my book..."

HAZEL

Augustus!?

GUS

I found his assistant. I emailed

her. She must have forwarded it to

him.

(Hazel is stunned)

Shall I continue?

HAZEL

Keep reading, keep reading!

31.

GUS

"I am particularly indebted to you,

sir, both for your kind words about

`An Imperial Affliction' and for

taking the time to tell me that the

book, and here I quote you

directly, `meant a great deal' to

you."

GUS

"To answer your question: No, I

have not written anything else, nor

will I. I do not feel that

continuing to share my thoughts

with readers would benefit either

them or me. However thank you again

for your generous email. Yours most

sincerely, Peter Van Houten.

HAZEL

You're making this up?

GUS

Hazel Grace, could I, with my

meager intellectual capabilities,

make up a letter from the great

Peter Van Houten?

HAZEL

Holy hell.

GUS

Indeed.

HAZEL

Can I... would you mind...

GUS

(SMILING)

Go check your in-box.

HAZEL (V.O.)

"Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name

is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend

Augustus Waters, who read your book

- at my recommendation - just

received an email from you at this

address. I hope you will not mind

that he shared that email with me."

32.

HAZEL (V.O.)

"I was wondering if you wouldn't

mind answering a few questions I

have about what happens after the

end of the book. Specifically, the

FOLLOWING:"

HAZEL (V.O.)

"Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch

Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man

up to something - or is he just

misunderstood? What happens to

Anna's friends?

HAZEL (V.O.)

Lastly, I was hoping you could shed

some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.

These questions have haunted me for

years. And I don't know how long I

have left to get answers to them."

HAZEL

"I know these are not important

literary questions and that your

book is full of important literary

questions, but I would just really

like to know."

HAZEL

(reading it aloud to him)

"And of course, if ever you do

decide to write anything else, even

if you don't want to publish it,

I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd

read your grocery lists. Yours with

great admiration, Hazel Grace

Lancaster. Age 16."

GUS

Not bad.

33.

HAZEL

You think?

GUS

Bit pretentious. But then again,

Van Houten uses words like

"tendentious" and... "bacchanalia"

so I think he'll like it.

HAZEL

Is it really almost 1?

GUS

Guess so.

HAZEL

I gotta get to sleep.

GUS

Ok...

HAZEL

Ok...

GUS

Ok...

HAZEL

Ok...

GUS

Perhaps "ok" will be our "always."

HAZEL

Ok.

GUS

Ok.

HAZEL

Ok.

34.

ISAAC

She hasn't even visited. Fourteen

months we were together. What kind

of person...

ISAAC'S NURSE

You'll get over her Isaac. Just

takes a little time. You'll see.

ISAAC

Is she gone?

HAZEL

Yeah.

ISAAC

Did she really just say "you'll

see?"

HAZEL

(shakes her head)

Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.

ISAAC

Doesn't pun your disability.

HAZEL

Gets blood on the first try.

ISAAC

That is huge. I mean, seriously, is

this my freakin' arm or a

dartboard? Three - no condescending

voice.

HAZEL

(lays it on thick)

"I'm gonna stab you with this

needle now, so there might be a

little ouchie."

HAZEL

You doing alright, Isaac?

ISAAC

I don't know. To be honest, I think

a hell of a lot more about Monica

than my eye. Is that crazy? That's

crazy.

HAZEL

It's a little crazy.

35.

ISAAC

But I believe in love, you know? I

don't believe that everybody gets

to keep their eyes or not get sick

or whatever, but everybody should

have true love. Don't you think?

ISAAC

Gus was here earlier.

HAZEL

(trying to be nonchalant)

Was he?

ISAAC

Mmm... that's better.

HAZEL

The pain?

(off his slow nod)

Good. Good, Isaac.

(Isaac closes his eyes)

What about Gus?

HAZEL

Holy shit!

(READING ALOUD)

"Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot

answer your questions, at least not

in writing, because to do so would

constitute a sequel, which you

might publish or otherwise share on

the internet. Not that I don't

trust you, but how could I trust

you, I barely know you."

HAZEL

"Should ever you find yourself in

Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your

leisure. Yours most sincerely,

Peter Van Houten" Son of a - WHAT

IS THIS LIFE!!!

36.

FRANNIE

What's wrong?!

HAZEL

(realizing she scared her)

Nothing. Sorry.

FRANNIE

(CONFUSED)

Nothing?

HAZEL

Everything! Look!

HAZEL

Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?

FRANNIE

Hazel, I... I love you and... you

know I'd do anything for you, but

we don't...

(PAINED)

We don't have the money. The

expense of getting equipment over

there - love, it's just not

possible...

HAZEL

(DEFLATES)

No, yeah, of course.

FRANNIE

I mean, I could talk to your father

OR --

HAZEL

Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything.

Forget I mentioned it.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Guilt is definitely a side effect

of cancer.

37.

GUS

Just use your wish.

HAZEL

I've used it already. Pre-

"Miracle."

GUS

What'd you do?

GUS

Not Disney.

HAZEL

I was 13...

GUS

Tell me you did not go to Disney

World.

(Hazel looks away)

Hazel Grace! You did not use your

one dying Wish to go to Disney

World!

HAZEL

(FEEBLE)

And Epcot Center.

GUS

(hands in the air)

Oh my God!

HAZEL

(DEFENDING HERSELF)

We had fun on that trip.

GUS

That is the saddest thing I've ever

heard!

HAZEL

I met Goofy...

GUS

Now I'm embarrassed.

HAZEL

Why are you embarrassed?

GUS

How can I have a crush on a girl

with such cliche wishes?

HAZEL

Wait, what?

38.

GUS

What?

MICHAEL

Is that a Rik Smits jersey?

GUS

It is indeed.

MICHAEL

(BEAT)

Man, I loved that guy.

HAZEL

Gus?

GUS

Hi Hazel.

(BEAT)

How would you like to go on a

picnic?

FRANNIE

Something to drink?

GUS

I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.

39.

MICHAEL

You're a survivor yourself?

GUS

(taps his leg)

Didn't cut this fella off for the

hell of it. Though it is an

excellent weight-loss strategy.

Legs are heavy!

MICHAEL

How's your health now?

GUS

N-E-C for fourteen months.

MICHAEL

That's fantastic.

GUS

I'm very lucky.

MICHAEL

Son, you have to understand...

Hazel's still pretty sick. She will

be the rest of her life.

MICHAEL

She'll want to keep up with you -

she's that kind of girl - but the

truth is, her lungs --

HAZEL

You ready Gus?

HAZEL

Is this where you bring all your

romantic conquests?

40.

GUS

Every last one.

(BEAT)

Probably why I'm still a virgin.

HAZEL

You're not a virgin.

(off his look)

Are you really?

GUS

See this? This circle is virgins...

GUS

And this... is 17 year old dudes

with one leg.

GUS

(EXPLAINING)

"Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.

HAZEL

He sounds Dutch.

GUS

And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And

tulips.

GUS

Sandwich?

HAZEL

Let me guess --

GUS

(NODS)

Dutch cheese. And tomato.

(she takes one)

The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.

41.

GUS

How cool is that? A skeleton being

used as a playground.

HAZEL

You do love your symbols.

GUS

Speaking of which...

GUS

You're probably wondering why

you're sitting here eating a bad

cheese sandwich and drinking orange

juice with a guy in a Rik Smits

jersey.

HAZEL

It has crossed my mind.

GUS

Hazel Grace, like so many before

you - and I say this with great

affection - you spent your Wish...

moronically.

HAZEL

I was thir--

GUS

Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand

soliloquy here.

HAZEL

Sorry. Please, continue...

GUS

You were young. Impressionable. The

Grim Reaper staring you in the

face. And the fear of dying with

your one true Wish left ungranted

led you to rush into making one you

didn't really want, for how could

little Hazel Grace, having never

read "An Imperial Affliction" ever

know that her one TRUE wish was to

visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his

Amsterdamian exile.

GUS

If you were smart, you would have

saved your wish til the time in

your life when you really knew your

true self.

42.

HAZEL

But I... didn't save it.

GUS

Good thing I saved mine.

GUS

Got it in exchange for the leg.

(BEAT)

And I still have it.

HAZEL

Are you saying --

GUS

I'm not gonna give you my Wish or

anything. But I too have an

interest in meeting Peter Van

Houten and it wouldn't make much

sense to meet him without the girl

who introduced me to his book, now

would it?

(Hazel's eyes widen)

I talked to the Genies and they're

in total agreement.

(BEAT)

We leave on May third.

HAZEL

Wait a minute.

(BEAT)

Are you only doing this so I'll

kiss you?

HAZEL

Cause I'd totally kiss you either

way.

HAZEL

Seriously... why are you doing

this?

43.

GUS

Because Hazel Grace... I found my

Wish.

FRANNIE (OVERLAP)

Are you out of your mind?

FRANNIE

It's too much, Haze. We can't

accept something like that from a

virtual stranger.

HAZEL

He's not a stranger.

FRANNIE

Really?

HAZEL

Don't be gross.

FRANNIE

It's still "no," I'm afraid.

HAZEL

Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?

DR. MARIA

That's out of the question.

HAZEL

You said the PET scan was

encouraging!

DR. MARIA

The PET scan is encouraging. We

just don't know how long it'll stay

that way. What if you get sick in a

foreign country?

HAZEL

They have doctors in Amsterdam. And

cancer. Someone will know what to

do.

44.

DR. MARIA

Be that as it may, without someone

familiar with your particular case,

I can't --

HAZEL

(turns to her Mom)

So you'll come too.

FRANNIE

What?

HAZEL

The Genies can hook it up. They're

loaded.

FRANNIE

I --

HAZEL

You've never been to Amsterdam,

have you Mom?

BLACK.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And then this happened.

HAZEL (V.O.)

People talk about the courage of

cancer patients. And I do not deny

that courage...

45.

HAZEL (V.O.)

I'd been poked and stabbed and

poisoned for years and still I trod

on.

HAZEL (V.O.)

But make no mistake...

HAZEL (V.O.)

In that moment I would have been

very, very happy to die.

HAZEL'S NURSE

Hello.

HAZEL

Hi.

HAZEL'S NURSE

You're ok, Hazel.

HAZEL'S NURSE

Would you like to see your parents?

FRANNIE

They thought it was a brain tumor.

MICHAEL

It wasn't - thank god --

46.

HAZEL

So what happened?

FRANNIE

The usual. Fluid in the lungs,

preventing oxygenation. They put

that in...

FRANNIE

Drained a liter and a half last

night.

MICHAEL

The good news is... no tumor

growth. No new tumors in your body.

MICHAEL

We're all so relieved.

FRANNIE

This is just a thing Hazel. It's a

thing we can live with.

GUS

Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?

MICHAEL

Better, thank you. Much better.

GUS

They won't let me in. Family only.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry --

GUS

No I get it. Will you just... will

you tell her I was here?

47.

MICHAEL

Of course I will.

MICHAEL

Gus.

MICHAEL

Why don't you go home, get some

rest?

ONCOLOGIST #1

The great news is... Phalanxifor

continues to control your tumor

growth.

(BEAT)

The not so great news is we're

still seeing serious problems with

fluid accumulation.

(BEAT)

So how should we proceed?

HAZEL

Um, I feel like I'm not the most

qualified person to answer that.

ONCOLOGIST #1

I was talking to Dr. Simmons.

DR. SIMMONS

It's a strange case. Normally the

tumors start resisting the

treatment. But that hasn't happened

here - yet.

DR. SIMMONS

Unfortunately, the drug may be

worsening the edema.

48.

DR. MARIA

But if we stopped it entirely,

we're likely to face even graver

dangers.

MICHAEL

So we're gonna do nothing?

DR. MARIA

That's what we have to decide. The

truth is... very few people have

been on Phalanxifor as long as

Hazel has. We don't really know the

long term effects.

HAZEL

Can't I just get like a lung

transplant or something?

DR. MARIA

You would not be considered a...

strong candidate for a transplant.

DR. SIMMONS

We're trying to prevent endothelial

growth while at the same time

preventing immunosorbent...

FRANNIE

(through the tears)

Are you ready, sweetie?

FRANNIE

I won't be a mom anymore.

49.

HAZEL

I have a question.

DR. MARIA

Yes Hazel.

HAZEL

Can I still go to Amsterdam?

DR. SIMMONS

That would not be wise at this

juncture.

HAZEL

Why not?

DR. SIMMONS

Excuse me?

HAZEL

Why not, Dr. Simmons?

DR. SIMMONS

I --

DR. MARIA

It would... increase some risks --

HAZEL

So does going to the mall --

DR. MARIA

Yes but an airplane?

HAZEL

They have oxygen on airplanes.

FRANNIE

HAZEL --

HAZEL

It's my life, right?

DR. SIMMONS

You're Stage IV --

50.

HAZEL

I have this opportunity I may never

have again. If the medicine's

working, I don't see why --

DR. SIMMONS

Because, Hazel.

(BEAT)

Look, I don't know any other way to

say this... You're just too sick.

DR. SIMMONS

I'm sorry.

CUT TO:

FRANNIE

We'll be right outside.

MICHAEL

Gus again.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.

51.

52.

GUS (O.S.)

Hazel Grace!

HAZEL

Hi Augustus.

GUS (O.S.)

Are you crying, Hazel Grace?

HAZEL

Kind of.

GUS (O.S.)

What's the matter?

HAZEL

I don't know. I want to go to

Amsterdam. And I want him to tell

us what happens after the book and

I don't want my particular life and

also the sky is making me sad and

there's this old swing set that my

Dad made for me when I was a kid.

It's just... everything.

GUS (O.S.)

I demand to see this swing set of

tears.

GUS

I see your point.

(BEAT)

That is one sad swing set.

HAZEL

Thanks for coming over.

53.

GUS

You do realize... trying to keep

your distance from me will in no

way lessen my affection for you.

GUS

All efforts to save me from you

will fail.

GUS

Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we

DON'T --

HAZEL

It's not about Amsterdam. It's

about me. It's about...

GUS

Grenades.

GUS

I get it. One day you're going to

explode in a huge ball of fire and

everyone close to you will die in

your wake.

HAZEL

Exactly.

GUS

There's already two people in your

life you're going to destroy. Why

add a third to that list. Am I

right?

HAZEL

(NODS)

That's why I don't have a hamster.

GUS

We have got to do something about

this frigging swing set.

54.

HAZEL

(TYPING)

"Swing Set Needs Home."

GUS

"Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs

Loving Home."

HAZEL

"Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing

Set Seeks Butts of Children."

HAZEL

No?

GUS

That's why.

GUS

In case you were wondering...

that's why I like you.

(beat, off her look)

You're so busy being you that you

have no idea how utterly

unprecedented you are.

CUT TO:

GUS

Friendly.

ISAAC

Do you like him?

HAZEL

Of course I like him.

55.

ISAAC

But you don't want to hook up with

him?

HAZEL

It's complicated.

HAZEL (V.O.)

"Dear Hazel, I have received word

via the Genies that you will be

visiting us with Augustus Waters

and your mother beginning on the

4th. A week away! Peter and I are

delighted and cannot wait to --

HAZEL

Mom?

HAZEL

Mom!

(STILL NOTHING)

MOM!!!

FRANNIE

What is it, what's wrong?!

HAZEL

Sorry, I... I didn't know you were

in the shower.

FRANNIE

(EXHAUSTED)

Bath. I was just... just trying to

take a bath for five seconds.

What's the matter?

HAZEL

Did you ever call the Genies to

tell them the trip is off? I just

got an email from Peter Van

Houton's assistant. She still

thinks we're coming.

56.

HAZEL

What?

FRANNIE

I'm not supposed to tell you until

your father gets home.

(BEAT)

We're going to Amsterdam.

HAZEL

(still not believing)

Really...

FRANNIE

Dr. Maria called last night and

made a convincing case that you

need to live --

HAZEL

(YELLING)

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!

FRANNIE

I'm getting back in the tub now.

HAZEL

(whispering to her lungs)

One week, lungs. Keep your shit

together one more week...

HAZEL

Amsterdam!

FRANNIE

Amsterdam!

57.

MICHAEL

Amsterdam!

MICHAEL

(WHISPERING)

I love you. I'm so proud of you.

HAZEL

For what?

GUS (O.S.)

BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT

BELONGS TO ME!

HAZEL

Mom?

FRANNIE

We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.

GUS

(TO FRANNIE)

Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.

(BEAT)

Hello, Hazel Grace.

58.

HAZEL

Ok...?

GUS

Ok.

HAZEL

Ok.

FRANNIE

Amsterdam!

HAZEL

(with some difficulty)

Amsterdam!

HAZEL

Oh that's not necessary.

59.

LITTLE GIRL

What's in your nose?

HAZEL

It's called a Cannula. These tubes

give me oxygen and help me breathe.

GIRL'S MOTHER

Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.

HAZEL

(SINCERE)

No, no. It's alright.

LITTLE GIRL

Would they help me breathe too?

HAZEL

I dunno. Wanna try?

LITTLE GIRL

Tickles.

HAZEL

Right?

LITTLE GIRL

I think I'm breathing better.

HAZEL

Well... I'd love to give you my

cannula but... I kinda really need

the help.

LITTLE GIRL

Thanks for letting me try it.

AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)

We will now begin pre-boarding

Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those

passengers in need of extra

assistance...

HAZEL

I think that's us.

60.

HAZEL

Have you never been on a plane

before?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.

Or... any plane.

GUS

(cigarette in his mouth)

I don't smoke.

HAZEL

It's a metaphor. He puts the

killing thing in his mouth but

doesn't give it the power to kill

him.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

(NO NONSENSE)

That metaphor is prohibited on

today's flight.

PA SYSTEM

"Flight attendants, prepare for

departure."

HAZEL

Ok?

HAZEL

This is what it feels like to ride

in a car with you.

GUS

We're flying! Look!

61.

GUS

Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS

EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL

OF HUMAN HISTORY!

FRANNIE

(not looking up from her

MAGAZINE)

Just so you know, I'm right here.

Sitting next to you. Your mother.

HAZEL

We're just friends, Mom.

GUS

She is. I'm not.

CAB DRIVER

Americans?

FRANNIE

We're from Indiana.

CAB DRIVER

Indiana. They steal from the

Indians but the keep the name, yes?

HAZEL

Something like that.

HAZEL

(to the Driver)

This is Amsterdam?

62.

CAB DRIVER

Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the

rings of a tree. It gets older as

you get closer to the center.

GUS

I'll be right down the hall.

HAZEL

Good morning.

FRANNIE

Actually, it's five o'clock.

HAZEL

How was the park?

FRANNIE

Never made it.

HAZEL

Mom!

FRANNIE

What? I like watching you sleep.

FRANNIE

I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff

tonight while you and Gus are at

dinner.

HAZEL

What do you mean?

63.

FRANNIE

You have reservations at a place

called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set

it up. Very fancy according to the

Book. And romantic.

HAZEL

Mom...

FRANNIE

I'm just saying...

HAZEL

A 16 year old girl running free

with an older boy on the streets of

a foreign city famous for its vice

and debauchery... is totally cool

with you. Is that what you're

saying?

FRANNIE

(beat, excited)

Let's get you dressed!

FRANNIE

(calling to the bathroom)

Hazel! Gus is here.

(TO GUS)

Looking sharp.

GUS

Thank you ma'am.

GUS

Wow.

HAZEL

I...

(BEAT)

Am I under-dressed?

GUS

You look gorgeous.

64.

HOSTESS

Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.

HOSTESS

The champagne is our gift.

GUS

Ok.

HAZEL

Ok.

HAZEL

Wow that's good.

WAITER

Do you know what Dom Perignon said

after he invented champagne?

(BEAT)

`Come quickly,' he said. `I am

tasting the stars!'

WAITER

Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like

a menu or will you have the chef's

choice?

65.

GUS

The chef's choice sounds lovely.

(the Waiter nods)

And can we get more of this?

WAITER

We have bottled all the stars for

you this evening, my young friends.

GUS

Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.

HAZEL

Thank you for letting me hijack

your wish.

GUS

Thank you for wearing that dress

which is like whoa.

WAITER

Belgian white asparagus with a

lavender infusion.

HAZEL

Oh my god.

GUS

Yeah?

HAZEL

I mean...

GUS

That is just...

HAZEL

There are no words.

GUS

(SHOUTING BACK)

We don't speak Dutch!

ANOTHER LOCAL

She says, "the beautiful couple is

beautiful!"

66.

GUS

I want this dragon carrot risotto

to become a person so I can take it

to Vegas and marry it.

HAZEL

I like your suit.

GUS

Thanks. First time wearing it.

HAZEL

That isn't the suit you wear to

funerals?

GUS

Oh no. That one's not nearly this

nice.

(off her look)

When I first found out I was sick -

I mean, they told me I had like an

85% chance to be cancer-free. Great

odds, sure. But that meant a year

of torture, the loss of my leg, and

still a 15% chance it might fail.

(BEAT)

So right before the surgery I asked

my parents if I could buy a suit,

like a really nice suit, just in

case I didn't make it.

HAZEL

It's your death suit.

GUS

That's what it is.

HAZEL

I have one of those. Bought it for

my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd

wear it on a date, though.

GUS

Are we on a date?

HAZEL

(cocks her head)

Watch it.

67.

GUS

God?

HAZEL

Maybe.

GUS

Angels?

HAZEL

Undecided.

GUS

Afterlife?

HAZEL

No. Well...

(BEAT)

Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to

say no. I just... I'd like some

evidence.

(GUS NODS)

What do you think?

GUS

Absolutely.

HAZEL

Really?

GUS

Oh for sure. I mean, not like a

heaven where you ride unicorns,

play harps, and live in a mansion

made of clouds but, yeah, I believe

in something.

GUS

Something becomes of us. It has to.

Otherwise what's the point?

HAZEL

Maybe there is no point.

GUS

I refuse to accept that.

(BEAT)

I won't accept it.

HAZEL

I hope you're right.

GUS

I'm in love with you.

68.

GUS

You heard me.

HAZEL

AUGUSTUS --

GUS

I'm in love with you. And I know

that love is just a shout into the

void, and that oblivion is

inevitable, and that we're all

doomed and that there will come a

day when all our labor has been

returned to dust, and I know the

sun will swallow the only earth

we'll ever have, and I am in love

with you.

(shrugs, matter-of-fact)

Sorry.

WAITER

More stars?

GUS

Just the check, please.

WAITER

No, sir.

(BEAT)

Your meal has been paid for by Mr.

Van Houten.

69.

FRANNIE

I really don't get that shirt.

HAZEL

Van Houten will get it. Trust me.

There are like fifty Magritte

references in "Imperial

Affliction."

FRANNIE

(READING)

"This is not a pipe."

HAZEL

Exactly.

FRANNIE

But it is a pipe.

HAZEL

No it's not. It's a drawing of a

pipe. See?

(SHE DOESN'T)

All representations of a thing are

inherently abstract. A drawing of a

thing is not the thing itself. Nor

is a t-shirt of a drawing of a

thing the thing itself.

FRANNIE

When did you get so grown up? I

feel like it was yesterday I was

telling 8-year old Hazel why the

sky was blue. You thought I was a

genius back then.

HAZEL

Why is the sky blue?

FRANNIE

(BEAT)

Because I say so.

GUS

Who's ready for some answers!

70.

HAZEL

I'm so excited I can barely

breathe.

GUS

As opposed to other days...?

GUS

Maybe he can't hear over the music?

MAN IN PAJAMAS

What?!

GUS

Mr. Van Houten?

MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

(SHOUTING)

LEEE-DUH-VIGH!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Are they here, Peter?

MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

There are two --

(BEAT)

Who the hell's "they?"

71.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

They are Augustus and Hazel, the

young fans with whom you've been

corresponding.

MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

The Americans?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

You invited them, remember?

MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

You know why I left America,

Lidewij? To never have to encounter

Americans. Get rid of them.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

I will not do this Peter. Be nice.

VAN HOUTEN

Which of you is Augustus Waters?

LIDEWIJ

Please. I am sorry. Come in.

HAZEL

Trash?

72.

LIDEWIJ

Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never

opens it.

VAN HOUTEN

Yours are the first missives to

which I've replied and look where

that got me.

VAN HOUTEN

Scotch?

HAZEL

Um, no thanks.

VAN HOUTEN

Augustus Waters?

GUS

It's 11am.

VAN HOUTEN

Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and

soda.

LIDEWIJ

Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

VAN HOUTEN

She thinks I have a drinking

problem.

LIDEWIJ

I also think the Earth is round.

VAN HOUTEN

So you like my book.

HAZEL

Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made

meeting you his Wish so that we

could come here and talk to you.

VAN HOUTEN

Did you dress like her on purpose?

HAZEL

(looks at her shirt)

Kinda.

73.

VAN HOUTEN

I do not have a drinking problem. I

have a Churchillian relationship

with alcohol: I can crack jokes and

govern England and do anything I

want to do. Except not drink.

GUS

Incidentally, thank you for dinner

last night.

VAN HOUTEN

(TO LIDEWIJ)

We bought them dinner last night?

LIDEWIJ

It was our pleasure.

VAN HOUTEN

(SIGHS)

You've come a long way so... what

is it I can do for you?

HAZEL

We have some questions --

VAN HOUTEN

Uh-huh...

HAZEL

About what happens, you know...

after... the end of your book.

Specifically to those who Anna

leaves behind. Like her Mom, the

Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --

VAN HOUTEN

(INTERRUPTING)

How familiar are you with Swedish

hip-hop?

HAZEL

I would say... limited?

VAN HOUTEN

But presumably you know Afasi Och

Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."

GUS

Um...

VAN HOUTEN

Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'

immediately.

74.

HAZEL

(yelling over the music)

I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak

Swedish.

VAN HOUTEN

(YELLING)

Who the hell speaks Swedish? The

important thing is not what

nonsense the voices are saying, but

what the voices are feeling.

GUS

Are you messing with us?

VAN HOUTEN

Pardon?

GUS

Is this some kind of performance?

VAN HOUTEN

Rudolf Otto said that if you had

not encountered the numinous then

his work was not for you. And I say

to you, my friends, if you cannot

hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic

response to fearfulness, then my

work is not for you.

HAZEL

So anyway... when the book ends,

Anna's mom --

VAN HOUTEN

(raising a hand to silence

HER)

Let us imagine that you are racing

a tortoise.

VAN HOUTEN

The tortoise has a ten yard head

start. In the time it takes you to

run ten yards, the tortoise has

moved maybe one yard. And so on,

forever.

(MORE)

75.

VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)

You are faster than the tortoise

but you can never catch him, you

see, you can only decrease his

lead. Now certainly you can run

past the tortoise as long as you

don't contemplate the mechanics

involved but the question of how

turns out to be so complicated that

no one really solved it until

Cantor's proof that some infinities

are bigger than other infinities.

VAN HOUTEN

I assume that answers your

questions.

GUS

(TO HAZEL)

I don't know what's going on.

VAN HOUTEN

And yet you seemed so intelligent

in print, Mr. Waters.

(under his breath)

Must be all that cancer in your

brain.

LIDEWIJ

Peter!

HAZEL

Can we please, maybe, talk about

Anna for a sec? I mean, I

understand that the story ends mid-

sentence because she dies or she

becomes too sick to continue --

VAN HOUTEN

I'm not interested in talking about

that book.

HAZEL

- but that doesn't mean her family

and everyone she loves doesn't have

a future, right?

VAN HOUTEN

I said I'm not interested --

HAZEL

(GETTING UPSET)

But you promised!

(CALMS HERSELF)

(MORE)

76.

HAZEL (CONT'D)

Mr. Van Houten, you said you would

tell us what happens and that's why

we're here. We... I need you tell

me. Surely you've thought about it.

I mean, as characters --

VAN HOUTEN

Nothing happens to them! They're

fictions. They cease to exist the

moment the novel is over.

HAZEL

They can't!

(again, has to calm

HERSELF)

I mean, I understand. In a literary

sense. But it's impossible NOT to

imagine some future --

VAN HOUTEN

I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid

of them, please.

(Lidewij doesn't move, he

turns back to Hazel)

I won't indulge your childish

whims. I refuse to pity you in the

manner in which you're accustomed.

HAZEL

I don't want your pity --

VAN HOUTEN

Of course you do. Like all sick

kids, your existence depends on it.

LIDEWIJ

Peter!

VAN HOUTEN

(on a roll)

You are fated to live out your days

as the child you were when

diagnosed, the child who believes

there is life after a novel ends.

And we, as adults, we pity this, so

we pay for your treatments, for

your oxygen machines. We give you

food and water though you are

unlikely to live long enough --

LIDEWIJ

PETER!

VAN HOUTEN

You are a side effect of an

evolutionary process that cares

little for individual lives.

(MORE)

77.

VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)

You are a failed experiment in

mutation.

LIDEWIJ

I RESIGN!

HAZEL

Hey listen douchepants. You're not

gonna tell me anything I don't

already know about illness. I need

one thing and one thing only from

you before I walk out of your life

and that's for you to tell me what

happens to your goddman characters!

VAN HOUTEN

(BEAT)

I cannot tell you.

HAZEL

Bullshit!

VAN HOUTEN

I cannot --

HAZEL

Make something up.

VAN HOUTEN

Lidewij. I'll have a martini

please.

LIDEWIJ

I have resigned.

VAN HOUTEN

Oh don't be ridiculous.

VAN HOUTEN

I'd like you to leave now.

HAZEL

You're really not gonna tell us?

VAN HOUTEN

I would like you... to leave.

78.

VAN HOUTEN

Have you ever stopped to ask why

you care so much about your silly

questions?

HAZEL

Go fuck yourself.

GUS

Hey. It's ok. It's ok...

(beat, an idea)

I'll write you a sequel.

(she cries harder)

I will. Better than any shit that

drunk could write. With blood and

guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.

HAZEL

I spent your Wish on that asshole.

GUS

You did not spend it on him. You

spent it on us.

HAZEL

I wanted...

GUS

I know... I know. Apparently the

world is not a wish-granting

factory.

LIDEWIJ

I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made

him cruel. I thought meeting you

would help him, if he would see

that his work has shaped real

lives, but... I'm very sorry.

79.

LIDEWIJ

Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.

Have you seen the Anne Frank House?

GUS

I'm not going anywhere with that

monster.

LIDEWIJ

He is not invited.

LIDEWIJ

I'm afraid there's no elevator.

HAZEL

Oh, um, that's alright.

LIDEWIJ

No, there are many stairs. Steep

stairs.

HAZEL

I can do it.

GUS

HAZEL --

HAZEL

I can do it!

LIDEWIJ

Shall we?

LIDEWIJ

This is the bookcase that hid the

Frank family and four others.

80.

GUS

You're a champion.

GUS

That's enough --

HAZEL

(RESOLUTE)

I'm ok.

GUS

We're at the top. That's it.

LIDEWIJ

The only member of the whole family

to survive was Otto, Anne's father.

LIDEWIJ

I don't know how you go on, without

your family.

81.

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

"At such moment's, I don't think

about the misery..."

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

"...but about the beauty that still

remains."

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

"Try to recapture the happiness

within yourself. Think of all the

beauty in everything around you...

and be happy."

GUS

It's above my knee.

GUS

It tapers a little and then it's

just skin --

HAZEL

What?

82.

GUS

My leg.

(BEAT)

Just so you're prepared --

HAZEL

Oh get over yourself.

HAZEL

I love you, Augustus Waters.

GUS

I love you too, Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

"Get up you fat bastard."

GUS

"I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."

HAZEL

I said "get up."

GUS

"Standing is for fools!"

HAZEL

God, what an asshole.

83.

HAZEL

It was awful, Mom. You can't

imagine.

FRANNIE

And then what happened?

HAZEL

Then we went to the Anne Frank

museum.

FRANNIE

And after that?

HAZEL

We just... walked around.

FRANNIE

Sounds lovely.

FRANNIE

Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs

a little. Give the two of you some

time to talk.

HAZEL

(THAT'S WEIRD)

Um... ok...

HAZEL

That was weird.

GUS

Shall we?

HAZEL

Augustus?

84.

GUS

There's something I have to tell

you...

GUS

Just before you went into the

hospital... There was this... I

felt this... ache in my hip.

HAZEL

Oh no...

GUS

I had a PET scan.

GUS

It lit up like a Christmas tree,

Hazel...

HAZEL

Oh god.

GUS

The lining of my chest, my liver...

everywhere.

HAZEL

Oh my god no!

HAZEL

I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so

SORRY --

GUS

I'm sorry too --

HAZEL

It's so unfair --

GUS

I should have told you --

HAZEL

It's so fucking unfair!

85.

GUS

Apparently the world is... not a

wish-granting factory.

GUS

Don't you worry about me, Hazel

Grace. I'll find a way to hang

around and annoy you for a long

time.

HAZEL

Does it hurt?

GUS

It's ok.

(BEAT)

I'm ok.

HAZEL

Ok.

GUS

Ok.

GUS

What?

HAZEL

I'm just... I'm very fond of you.

GUS

I don't suppose you can forget

about it, treat me like I'm not

dying.

HAZEL

I don't think you're dying,

Augustus. You've just got a touch

of cancer.

GUS

Would it be absolutely ludicrous to

make out right now?

86.

HAZEL

Gus had a recurrence.

MICHAEL

(NODS)

Mrs. Waters told us the night

before you left.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry Hazel.

HAZEL

You're not gonna say it?

MICHAEL

What's that?

HAZEL

The usual. "Everything happens for

a reason..."

MICHAEL

I don't know, Haze.

(BEAT)

I always thought being an adult

meant knowing what you believe...

(BEAT)

... that has not been my

experience.

87.

HAZEL

How are your eyes?

ISAAC

Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're

not in my head is the only problem.

GUS

I hate to one-up you but... seems

my entire body is made out of

cancer now, so...

GUS

Whoa, I'm taken.

ISAAC

(to Hazel, re: Gus)

Did you write his eulogy yet?

GUS

Dude.

ISAAC

What?

GUS

I haven't asked her.

ISAAC

Oh.

(BEAT)

Oops.

HAZEL

What are you talking about?

ISAAC

My bad.

HAZEL

(STILL CONFUSED)

Augustus?

88.

GUS

I need speakers at my funeral. I

thought maybe you and Isaac... but

especially you --

ISAAC

Hey!

GUS

Would you be kind enough to whip

something up?

HAZEL

(touches his hand)

It would be an honor.

ISAAC

You guys are adorable.

HAZEL

How's your love life? Anything from

Monica?

ISAAC

Not a word.

HAZEL

She hasn't even like, texted to ask

how you're doing?

HAZEL

That is so messed up!

ISAAC

I've stopped thinking about it.

Moving on. There's a new girl in

Support Group with these humongous -

HAZEL

How do you even know that?

ISAAC

I'm blind but I'm not that blind.

GUS

Hazel Grace!

GUS

Do you happen to have four dollars?

89.

HAZEL

Ok now what?

ISAAC

Is it there?

GUS

Oh it's there.

ISAAC

She's in the house?

GUS

Who cares where she is? This is not

about her. This is about you.

(sticks out his hand)

Hazel...

ISAAC

I didn't hear anything.

GUS

A little to the left.

ISAAC

My throw was to the left or I

should aim to the left?

GUS

Aim left.

90.

GUS

Lefter.

GUS

Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.

GUS

Bullseye!

ISAAC

Really?

GUS

No you missed it by like 20 feet.

(hands him a THIRD)

Try one more time.

HAZEL

Woo hoo!

GUS

Keep throwing, keep throwing!

MONICA'S MOM

What in God's name --

GUS

Are you Monica's mom?

MONICA'S MOM

(CONFUSED)

I am.

GUS

Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done

an injustice and we've come here

seeking revenge. We may not look

like much. Between the three of us,

we have five legs, four eyes, and

two and a half working lungs.

(MORE)

91.

GUS (CONT'D)

But we also have two dozen eggs. So

If I was you, I would go back

inside.

HAZEL (V.O.)

A few days later, Gus landed in the

hospital with chest pains.

HAZEL

How's he doing?

MRS. WATERS

He's had a tough night, Hazel. His

blood pressure's low. His heart --

HAZEL

What about the chemo?

MRS. WATERS

(shakes her head)

They're gonna stop the chemo.

HAZEL

Can I see him?

MRS. WATERS

(BEAT)

We have to be a family now.

MRS. WATERS

We'll tell him you were here.

HAZEL

If you don't mind, I'll just hang

for a while.

92.

HAZEL

What are you thinking about?

GUS

Oblivion.

HAZEL

Augustus...

GUS

I know it's kid's stuff but... I

always thought I'd have a grand

story to tell, you know? Something

that would run in all the papers. I

always thought I was special.

HAZEL

You are.

GUS

Yeah but... you know what I mean.

GUS

What?

HAZEL

I do know what you mean, I just...

I don't agree.

HAZEL

This obsession with being

REMEMBERED --

GUS

Don't get mad --

HAZEL

But I am mad!

(BEAT)

I think you're special, is that not

enough?

GUS

HAZEL --

93.

HAZEL

You think the only way to live a

meaningful life is for everyone to

love you, for everyone to remember

you. Well guess what, Gus, this is

your life. This is all you get. You

get me, and your family, and this

world. And if that's not enough,

well I'm sorry, but it's not

nothing. Cause I'll remember you,

I'll love you --

GUS

You're right --

HAZEL

And I just wish... I just wish

you'd be happy with that.

GUS

You're right. I'm sorry.

(pulling her back down)

I'm sorry.

GUS

It's a good life, Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

It's not over yet, you know.

HAZEL

Hello?

GUS (O.S.)

(WEAKLY)

Hazel Grace.

HAZEL

(RELIEVED)

Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!

GUS (O.S.)

I'm at the gas station --

94.

HAZEL

What?

GUS (O.S.)

Something's wrong. You gotta...

please come help me.

GUS

(MUMBLING)

Hi.

HAZEL

(PANICKED)

Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.

GUS

No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do

not call 911 or my parents -- I'll

never forgive you -- Don't, please.

GUS

Please just look at it.

HAZEL

I think it's infected...

HAZEL

Gus, what the -- why are you here?

Why aren't you home?

HAZEL

Oh, sweetie...

GUS

I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I

lost my pack. Or they took it.

(MORE)

95.

GUS (CONT'D)

I don't know. They said they'd get

me another one but I wanted... to

do it myself. Do one little thing

myself.

HAZEL

I can't fix this. I have to call

someone. I'm sorry.

GUS

No, Hazel, please!

HAZEL (V.O.)

I wish I could say Augustus Waters

kept his sense of humor till the

end, did not for a moment waiver in

his courage and his spirit soared

like an eagle to the sky...

GUS

(to himself, shaking)

I hate myself I hate myself I hate

this I hate this...

HAZEL (V.O.)

...but that is not what happened.

GUS

Read me something.

HAZEL

Read you something?

GUS

Do you know any poems?

HAZEL

I know one.

GUS

Read it to me.

HAZEL

"The Red Wheelbarrow" by William

Carlos Williams.

(beat, tries to remember)

"So much depends / upon / a red

wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /

water / beside the white /

chickens."

96.

GUS

(BEAT)

Is that it?

HAZEL

No of course not. Um... what

else...

(THINKS)

so much depends/ upon a blue sky/

cut open by the branches/ of the

trees./ So much depends/ on the

transparent G-tube/ erupting from

the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.

HAZEL

So much depends upon this observer/

of the universe...

HAZEL (V.O.)

One of the less bull-shitty

conventions of the cancer genre is

the convention known as the "Last

Good Day..."

HAZEL (V.O.)

This is where the victim of cancer

finds himself unexpectedly with

some hours...

97.

HAZEL (V.O.)

... when it seems like the

inexorable decline has suddenly

plateaued, when the pain is for a

minute bearable.

HAZEL (V.O.)

The problem, of course, is that

there's no way of knowing that your

last good day is your "Last Good

Day." At the time, it's just

another decent day.

HAZEL

Hi, Augustus.

GUS (O.S.)

Good evening, Hazel Grace.

GUS (O.S.)

Quick question for you. Did you

ever write that eulogy I asked you

to prepare?

HAZEL

I may have...

GUS

Excellent. Do you think you could

find yourself at the Literal Heart

of Jesus in 20 minutes.

HAZEL

Um... sure. Is everything --

GUS (O.S.)

I love you Hazel.

HAZEL

I gotta go.

FRANNIE

Finish eating first.

HAZEL

I can't, I have to meet Gus.

98.

FRANNIE

You haven't eaten a thing.

HAZEL

I'm not hungry.

FRANNIE

You can't not eat, Hazel.

HAZEL

I am aggressively unhungry, ok?

MICHAEL

HAZEL --

HAZEL

I have to go.

FRANNIE

Sit down.

HAZEL

No!

MICHAEL

Hazel, listen to your mother.

FRANNIE

You have to eat, Hazel. You're not

gonna starve yourself to death just

because Gus is sick. You have to

stay healthy --

HAZEL

I can't! I can't stay healthy

because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am

dying. I am going to die and leave

you here alone and you won't have

me to hover around and you won't be

a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,

but I can't do anything about it,

ok?! Just leave me alone!

FRANNIE

You heard me?

FRANNIE

You heard me say that to your

father?

99.

FRANNIE

Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was

wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not

something I believe.

FRANNIE

As long as either of us is alive, I

will be your mother. Even if you

die, I --

HAZEL

When.

FRANNIE

Even when you die, I will still be

your mother. I will always be your

Mother.

HAZEL

I worry that you won't have a life.

That you'll sit around all day with

no me to look after and stare at

the walls and be miserable or off

yourselves or something.

FRANNIE

We're not gonna off ourselves. It's

gonna hurt like hell to lose you

BUT --

MICHAEL

Hazel. You of all people know it's

possible to live with pain.

FRANNIE

I don't just sit around, you know.

FRANNIE

I'm taking some classes. Online. To

get my master's in social work.

HAZEL

You are?

HAZEL

So when you're waiting for me

outside Support Group or whatever,

you're always --

100.

FRANNIE

Working or reading. If I get my

MSW, I can council families in

crisis or lead groups dealing with

ILLNESS --

HAZEL

Why didn't you tell me?

MICHAEL

We didn't want you to feel

ABANDONED --

HAZEL

Are you kidding? Mom, this is

awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my

god!

HAZEL

I'm so excited! You're gonna be so

great, Mom!

FRANNIE

Thank you. That means everything to

me.

FRANNIE

I'd still really like you to eat.

HAZEL

I know Mom. And I will. I promise.

But right now... I really gotta go.

GUS

Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.

HAZEL

I know, right?

(BEAT)

So, um, what's going on guys?

ISAAC

You're late.

HAZEL

Late for what exactly?

101.

GUS

I wanted to attend my funeral. By

the way, will you speak at my

funeral?

GUS

Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to

attend as a ghost, but just to make

sure, I thought I'd - well, not to

put you on the spot, but I thought

I'd arrange a pre-funeral.

HAZEL

Why now?

GUS

No time like the present.

HAZEL

(looks around the room)

How did you even get in here?

GUS

Would you believe they leave the

door open at night?

HAZEL

Um, no.

GUS

As well you shouldn't.

ISAAC

"Augustus Waters was a self-

aggrandizing bastard. But we

forgive him. We forgive him... not

because he had a heart as

figuratively good as his actual one

sucked, or because he got 18 years

when he should have gotten more."

GUS

17.

ISAAC

I'm assuming you've got some time,

you interrupting bastard! I mean

seriously...

(back to the speech)

"Augustus Waters talked so much

that he'd interrupt you at his own

funeral. And he was pretentious.

(MORE)

102.

ISAAC (CONT'D)

Sweet Jesus that kid never took a

piss without pondering the

resonances of human waste

production. And he was vain. But

that comes with superhuman

handsomeness."

ISAAC

"But I will say this: when the

scientists of the future show up at

my house with robot eyes and they

tell me to try them on, I will tell

the scientists to piss off, because

I don't even want to see a world

without Augustus Waters."

ISAAC

"And then, of course, having made

my rhetorical point, I will put my

robot eyes on because, I mean...

robot eyes!"

ISAAC

"So anyway, Augustus, my friend...

Godspeed."

GUS

Thank you Isaac.

ISAAC

Goddamn it, Gus.

GUS

Hey don't swear in the Literal

Heart of Jesus.

ISAAC

Shit! Ass! Balls!

ISAAC

Can I get a hand here, Hazel?

GUS

Hazel Grace, it's down to you.

103.

HAZEL

"Augustus Waters was the great star-

crossed love of my life. Ours was

an epic love story, and I won't be

able to get more than a sentence

into it without disappearing into a

puddle of tears.

(BEAT)

Like all real love stories - ours

will die with us, as it should. I'd

hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,

because there's no one I'd rather

have..."

HAZEL

(beat, composing herself)

"I can't talk about our love story

so instead I will talk about math.

I am not a mathematician, but I

know this: there are infinite

numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1

And .12 And .112 And an infinite

collection of others. Of course,

there is a bigger infinite set of

numbers between 0 and 2, or between

0 and a million. Some infinities

are bigger than other infinities. A

writer we used to like taught us

that. I want more numbers than I'm

likely to get, and God, I want more

numbers for Augustus Waters than he

got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot

tell you how thankful I am for our

little infinity. You gave me a

forever within the numbered days,

and for that I am eternally

grateful. I love you."

BLACK.

104.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Augustus Waters died eight days

later in the ICU...

HAZEL (V.O.)

... when the cancer, which was made

of him, stopped his heart, which

was also made of him.

HAZEL (V.O.)

It was unbearable. The whole thing.

Every second worse than the last.

HAZEL (V.O.)

One of the first things they ask

you in the ER is to rate your pain

on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been

asked this question hundreds of

times and I remember once, early

on, when I couldn't catch my breath

and it felt like my chest was on

fire, and the nurse asked me to

rate the pain and though I couldn't

speak, I held up 9 fingers.

HAZEL (V.O.)

Later on, when I'd been feeling

better, the nurse came in and she

called me a fighter. "You know how

I know," she said. "Because you

called a ten a nine."

HAZEL (V.O.)

But that wasn't the truth. The

reason I called it a nine was... I

was saving my ten.

105.

HAZEL (V.O.)

And this was it. The great and

terrible ten.

MRS. WATERS

He loved you so much.

HAZEL

He loved you so much too.

HAZEL

It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.

MINISTER

I think we're ready to begin.

MINISTER

Augustus Waters fought hard for

many years. His battle was a

courageous one and his strength was

a source of inspiration for each

and every one of us...

MALE VOICE

What a load of shit, eh kid?

106.

MINISTER

Let us pray.

VAN HOUTEN

We need to fake pray now.

MINISTER

Now I call on Augustus's close

friend Isaac to say a few words.

ISAAC

Of all the things I've lost in my

life, this hurts the most.

MINISTER

And now we'll hear from Gus's...

special friend Hazel Lancaster.

HAZEL

I was his girlfriend.

HAZEL

There's a beautiful quote in Gus's

home that reads "if you want the

rainbow, you gotta deal with the

rain."

HAZEL (V.O.)

I didn't believe a word, of course.

But that was ok. Funerals, I'd

decided, aren't for the dead.

They're for the living.

107.

HAZEL

I'll be fine.

FRANNIE

Are you sure? We can drive you --

HAZEL

No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for

a while.

VAN HOUTEN

Could I hitch a ride?

VAN HOUTEN

Just to the bottom of the hill.

HAZEL

How did you even --

VAN HOUTEN

The internet.

HAZEL

And you just... bought a ticket?

VAN HOUTEN

The drinks are free drinks in First

Class.

VAN HOUTEN

Omnis Cellula e cellula.

VAN HOUTEN

Your boy Waters and I corresponded

quite a bit in his last --

HAZEL

You read your fan mail now?

108.

VAN HOUTEN

I would hardly call him a fan. He

despised me. But he was quite

insistent I attend his funeral and

tell you what became of Anna and

her mother. So here I am and that's

your answer: omnis cellula e

cellula.

HAZEL

I'm so not in the mood --

VAN HOUTEN

"Life comes from life."

HAZEL

Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.

VAN HOUTEN

You don't want an explanation?

HAZEL

Nope. Thanks though. Have a great

life.

VAN HOUTEN

You remind me of her.

HAZEL

(BEAT)

I remind a lot of people of a lot

of people.

VAN HOUTEN

She was eight, my daughter. She

suffered... beautifully. For so

long.

HAZEL

She had leukemia? Like Anna?

VAN HOUTEN

Just like her, yes.

HAZEL

Were you married then?

VAN HOUTEN

Not when she died, no. I was

insufferable long before Anna, my

dear. Grief doesn't change you,

Hazel, it reveals you.

HAZEL

Well I'm sorry for your loss.

109.

VAN HOUTEN

And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry

for everything, for being so rude

to you two, for ruining your trip --

HAZEL

You didn't ruin our trip, you

asshole. We had an awesome trip.

VAN HOUTEN

Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You

asked me to tell you what happens

and I wish I could do that. I wish

that I could. But I can't. No one

can. No one knows, Hazel. They

don't talk to us. Unless...

HAZEL

You think I care about that? I

don't give a shit, Van Houten.

HAZEL

You're a drunk and a jerk and a

failure. And I'd like you to get

out of my car right now so I can go

home and grieve.

VAN HOUTEN

(STUNNED)

BUT --

HAZEL

Get out of the car!

110.

HAZEL

(THROUGH TEARS)

Occupada.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Can I come in?

MICHAEL

I'm so so sorry.

(BEAT)

It was a privilege to love him,

though, wasn't it?

MICHAEL

Gives you an idea how we feel about

you.

ISAAC

Do you know if it hurt or whatever?

HAZEL

He was really fighting for breath,

I guess. He eventually went

unconscious, but it seems like,

yeah, it wasn't great or anything.

Dying sucks.

ISAAC

(LONG BEAT)

It just seems so impossible.

HAZEL

Happens all the time.

ISAAC

Are you angry?

HAZEL

Very.

111.

ISAAC

Me too.

(a few beats)

Gus really loved you, you know.

HAZEL

I know.

ISAAC

He wouldn't shut up about it.

HAZEL

I know.

ISAAC

It was annoying.

HAZEL

I didn't find it that annoying.

ISAAC

Did you read the note or whatever

from your author friend?

HAZEL

He is not my friend and -- how do

you know about that?

ISAAC

We talked at the cemetery. Said he

came all this way to give you that.

HAZEL

Yeah well I'm over it. I never want

to read another word of that

asshole's again.

ISAAC

Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus

did.

HAZEL

(STUNNED)

What?

ISAAC

That's what he said. Gus had

written something, sent it to Van

HOUTEN --

ISAAC

What?

HAZEL

I... I have to go. I... Are you...?

112.

ISAAC

I do it all the time. Go.

GUS'S VOICE

Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person

but a shitty writer. You're a

shitty person but a good writer.

We'd make a good team. I don't want

to ask you any favors but if you

have the time, and from what I saw

you have plenty, please fix this

for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.

GUS'S VOICE

She asked me to write one and I'm

trying, I just, I could use a

little flair. See the thing is...

we all want to be remembered.

GUS'S VOICE

We all want to leave a mark.

GUS'S VOICE

But not Hazel. Hazel is different.

Hazel knows the truth. She didn't

want a million admirers, she just

wanted one. And she got it. Maybe

she wasn't loved widely but she was

loved deeply. And isn't that more

than most of us get?

GUS'S VOICE

When Hazel was sick, I knew I was

dying. But I didn't want to say so.

113.

GUS'S VOICE

She was in ICU and I snuck in for

ten minutes and sat with her before

I got caught. Her eyes were closed,

her lungs were intubated...

GUS'S VOICE

... but her hands were still her

hands, still warm, and the nails

painted this dark blue back color

and I just held her hands and I

willed myself to imagine a world

without us and what a worthless

world that would be.

GUS'S VOICE

She's so beautiful. You don't get

tired of looking at her. You never

worry if she's smarter than you

cause you know she is. She's funny

without ever being mean.

SHE REMEMBERS:

GUS'S VOICE

I love her, god I love her. I'm so

lucky to love her, Van Houten.

(MORE)

114.

GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)

You don't get to choose if you get

hurt in this world but you do have

a say in who hurts you.

GUS'S VOICE

I like my choices. I hope she likes

hers.

GUS'S VOICE

Ok, Hazel Grace?

HAZEL

Ok.

BLACK.
