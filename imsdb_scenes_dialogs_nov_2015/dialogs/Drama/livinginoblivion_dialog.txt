Screenplay by

Tom DiCillo

SHOOTING DRAFT

1995

BERT

What time is it?

CYBIL

Four. Why?

BERT

This milk is bad.

CYBIL

(sniffs)

When did you buy it?

BERT

Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?

CYBIL

Monday.

(pause)

There's a deli on Broadway.

BERT

Nothing closer?

CYBIL

Nothing that's open.

BERT

(sniffs the milk)

Is it that bad?

CYBIL

I don't know. You're the one who

said it was bad.

WOLF

This is the worst fucking coffee

I've had in my life.

CYBIL

Then don't drink it.

GAFFER

What're we doing today?

WOLF

(pulls out a wrinkled

callsheet)

"Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks

to Mom."

AC

Any nudity?

CYBIL

Yeah, you have to take your fucking

pants off.

AC

I'll do it. I like Ellen.

GAFFER

Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse

in that Richard Gere movie.

BERT

I worked on that.

AC

The shower scene.

WOLF

Start with the 5K in the window. Run

feeders for three blonds into the

living room.

GAFFER

Two people. Sitting? Standing?

WOLF

Who fuckin' knows?

GAFFER

(walks off)

"Ellen talks to Mom."

JEFF

Tired?

NICOLE

No, I've been up since four. I've

got a big scene today and I'm kind

of nervous.

JEFF

"Ellen talks to Mom."

NICOLE

Have you read the script?

JEFF

No. It's on the callsheet.

NICOLE

Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I

tell my mother I never felt she really

loved me.

JEFF

You're going to yell at each other?

NICOLE

I don't know. I'm just going to go

with how I feel. Which is the scary

part. I'm very close to this

character.

JEFF

Problems with your own mom?

NICOLE

Yes. But she died before I, well

before we could reconcile...

JEFF

You were great in that Richard Gere

movie.

NICOLE

Thanks.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO

memory of this whatsoever.

NICOLE

Good morning, "Mom."

CORA

(gruff)

Morning.

NICOLE

Sleep well?

CORA

Not a wink.

NICK

Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda.

I'm just saying we left last night

and I knew we didn't get that scene.

WANDA

I'm sorry, I thought it was a great

scene, Nick.

NICK

It was OK; and it's going to be

alright. But I'm not settling for OK

today. This is a big scene and I'm

not leaving till we get it.

WANDA

Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here

for you.

NICK

Alright, here's what I'm thinking.

Wolf, I want to do the whole scene

in one shot.

WOLF

It's been done.

NICK

I know that but I'd like to try it

anyway.

WOLF

Handheld.

NICK

No, dolly. We go from Close-up to

Wide-shot and back to Close-up in

the same shot.

WOLF

I'll use the 35, minimize distortion;

I'll light it all from the ceiling.

It could be kind of great.

WANDA

Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?

WOLF

I'll need to see a couple run-

throughs.

NICK

Not too many. It's a tough scene for

the actors. I want them to feel

relaxed, fresh...

WANDA

We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it

takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an

hour, 45?

WOLF

I don't know how you drink that shit

black, Nick. I got to dump in the

milk. It's the only way I can cut

the taste.

NICK

Jesus!

WOLF

What the fuck?!

WANDA

Flame on, asshole!!

WANDA

OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the

work. Lock it up. Going for picture.

NICK

OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing

fine. Remember, really listen and

really answer.

(smiles at Nicole)

I've got nothing to say to you. Just

let it happen. It's all there.

WANDA

Ready, Nick?

WOLF

Look at this a second, Nick.

WOLF

I pushed in a foot. She's incredible.

It's coming right through the lens.

NICK

That's great, man. Beautiful.

WANDA

Ready, Nick?

NICK

Let's go. Right away.

WANDA

And, roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

And, roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take one.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever.

NICOLE

You were just standing there looking

at me. Then you pulled me up and

said, "You're not hurt." Like I was

disgusting for faking, for doing the

only thing I could think of to keep

him from hitting me again.

CORA

I was worried about Danny.

NICOLE

You do remember.

CORA

He was smaller than you.

NICOLE

You were so worried about Danny --

WOLF

Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut.

Les, your boom was all the way in

the shot.

BOOM

Well, where's the frame line?

WANDA

OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it

down. We're going again right away.

Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame

line?

BOOM

I guess so.

WANDA

OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's

up.

NICK

Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused.

Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go,

Wanda. Right away.

WANDA

Roll sound!

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I --

AC

I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was

completely off on the focus. It's my

fault, I'm sorry.

WANDA

Thanks for the apology but you'll

never work in this town again.

(laughter)

AC

I've got it now.

WANDA

Here we go, right away. Lock it up.

And roll sound...

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll Camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take three.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever.

SOUND

Street noise!

WANDA

That's a cut!

(into her walkie)

What the fuck's going on down there!?

You call that a lock-up!? Get that

car out of there!

NICK

Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy

just get a flatbed trailer with about

600 speakers on it and tow it behind

his car.

SOUND

And... it's clear.

WANDA

(into her walkie)

Do I have a lock-up?

WALKIE (V.O.)

kkkkkssst... sttttss yes.

WANDA

Is that a real lock-up?

WALKIE (V.O.)

ssssssssssssppppkkss.

WANDA

OK, right away. Picture's up. Roll

sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

And, roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take four.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever.

NICOLE

You were just standing there looking

at me. Then you pulled --

WOLF

Boom's in.

NICK

Jesus Christ.

BOOM

Where?

WOLF

The whole left side of frame, Les.

WANDA

Alright, can we please get a

motherfucking frame line please?!

BOOM

The frame keeps changing.

WOLF

That's the idea, Les.

SOUND

May I make a suggestion? Is it

possible to maybe break the shot

down? Maybe two shots instead? Might

make it easier for Les.

NICK

No.

SOUND

Then I need ten minutes to switch to

radio mikes.

WANDA

Your call, Nick.

NICK

There won't be any other sound

problems?

SOUND

No more boom problems.

NICK

Switch to radios.

WANDA

That's a ten-minute break. Release

the lock-up. Stand by.

WOLF

(to the AC)

Get me a coffee. Half milk.

NICK

I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.

NICOLE

It's not your fault, Nick. Is there

a way to use some of the earlier

takes?

NICK

Not unless I change the shot; do a

cutaway of Cora or something and

intercut the takes. I don't want to

do that. It's a really nice shot and

what you're doing is incredible.

NICOLE

Thanks, Nick.

NICK

The radio mikes are going to make

everything easier. So, look. Take a

moment. Let all this shit go. We

don't roll till you're ready.

NICOLE

OK.

SCRIPT (V.O.)

How was she in that Richard Gere

movie?

CYBIL (V.O.)

So-so.

SCRIPT

Her career really took off, didn't

it?

CYBIL

I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.

SCRIPT

She is nice; but I could do a better

job.

WANDA

Where's that flag going?

GAFFER

It's a scrim.

WANDA

Wolf!

WOLF

Two seconds, Wanda.

WANDA

No. No more tweaking. Picture's up.

(into her walkie)

Lock it up!

WANDA

And, roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take five.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory --

CORA

Oh, God!

NICK

Jesus fucking Christ!

WOLF

(to the Gaffer)

Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug.

Right there by your foot.

WANDA

That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora,

are you alright?

WANDA

Props. Props! Let's get a broom up

here right away. Clear the set!

NICK

Well, let's see. What do you think

is going to happen next, Cora?

CORA

I'm going to have a heart attack!

NICK

No, you're not. You're going in there

in two minutes and we are really

going to nail this scene. I know it.

I have no doubt about it. Nicole...

WANDA (V.O.)

Nick! Nick!

NICK

One second!

CORA

I'll tell you this much right now; I

am never, ever doing another fucking

low-budget movie.

NICK

What's up?

WANDA

Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's

losing it a little bit. You got three

quarters of the scene really, really

incredible in the first take. Do a

quick cut-away and all you need is a

pickup of the last part of the scene.

NICK

Wolf?

WOLF

You know how I feel; I love this

shot. Hell, I designed it.

NICK

Then let's just stick with the game

plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're

going to get it this time, I feel

it.

WANDA

We're here for you, Nick. Whatever

it takes.

WANDA

Thanks.

WANDA

And, roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

And, roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take six.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

I...

NICK

Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the

line? Just say it to me; no acting.

CORA

I...

(pause)

AC

"Ellen, I have no memory of this

line whatsoever."

WANDA

OK, could we get the line please?!

Script!

SCRIPT

(Pam)

"Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever."

WANDA

Thank you. And, roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

And, roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take seven.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway --

CORA

I was worried about Danny!

NICOLE

I'm sorry, I'm lost...

NICK

Cut. It's OK. No big deal.

NICK

Everyone relax. We're just going to

run the lines. That's all. No acting.

Just run the lines. Then we're going

to shoot this fucking scene.

CORA

(whispers)

I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up

for you.

NICOLE

(whispers)

Cora, don't even think that. You're

doing great. I'm the one who's fucking

it up. If I get through this I swear

I'm never acting again.

NICK

(faintly, from a

distance)

And, action on the run-through.

NICK (V.O.)

And action on the run-through.

NICOLE

Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

It didn't hurt that much but I started

crying anyway, hoping he would leave

me alone. He went over and started

hitting Danny.

CORA

Ellen, I have no memory of this

whatsoever.

NICOLE

You were just standing there looking

at me.

NICK

(whispering)

Roll camera... roll camera.

NICK

Where's Wolf?

AC

(whispers)

In the bathroom... he doesn't feel

good.

NICK

(whispers)

Get him! Get him!

NICOLE

Then you pulled me up and said,

"You're not hurt." Like I was

disgusting for faking, for doing the

only thing I could think of to keep

him from hitting me again.

CORA

I was worried about Danny.

NICOLE

You do remember.

CORA

He was smaller than you.

NICOLE

You were so worried about Danny.

What about me, Mom? Why weren't you

worried about me?

NICK

Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!

WOLF

One second!

WANDA

OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the

milk downstairs. OK? It appears to

be bad.

NICK

I've had to, well I've changed the

shot; we're just a little pressed

for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen

for the last part of the scene,

starting with Cora's "I was worried

about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to

cut this into the fourth take. We

almost had it. That was unbelievable,

both of you. But let's not think

about it. That moment is gone, and...

we'll, we'll get another one. I have

no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.

WOLF

I'm ready, Nick.

NICK

Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

And, roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

And, roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, Pickup, take one.

(hits the sticks)

NICK

Action.

CORA

I was worried about Danny.

NICOLE

You do remember.

CORA

He was smaller than you.

NICOLE

You were so worried about Danny.

What about me, Mom? Why weren't --

NICK

CUT!!!!

WANDA

What the fuck is that?! Sound?

SOUND

(frantically checking

his equipment)

It's not me.

BOOM

It's the camera.

WOLF

The fuck it is. It's off; it's not

even running.

WANDA

(into her walkie)

What's going on down there?! Do I

have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't

hear a beeping sound?

(to Nick)

The street's quiet.

NICK

Then what the fuck is it!!?

AC

It's somebody's watch!

WOLF

Not mine.

WANDA

Not mine.

SOUND

Not mine.

BOOM

Not mine.

NICK

Where is it!! You motherfucker! You

cock-sucking motherfucking bastard!

Where the fuck are you!? Where!!

Where!!

NICK

Can someone help me please?! Do I

have to do everything myself here?!

NICK

Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn

your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you

finally going to pay attention here?!

Hey, focus puller, you want to make

a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got

some great fuckin' Thai Stick here!

Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret-

wearing motherfucker! I saw your

reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell

would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda,

next time can you wear a shirt that's

a little more distracting to my

actors!

(to the Gaffer)

Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make

a little more noise on the dolly you

creaky motherfucker!

(to Cybil)

What is your name!? What do you

fucking do around here?!

(to the Soundman)

Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't

even find a teeny fucking beep?!

NICK

See what I have to put up with,

Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do

some of that magic on camera!? But

no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking

his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"

NICK

God...

(this is not a sigh

of relief)

WOLF

Well, when did he ask you?

WANDA

Yesterday, when I was helping him

check into his hotel.

WOLF

What, the guy can't even check into

a hotel by himself?

WANDA

Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino

in this movie will benefit us all.

If being there when he checks into

his hotel makes him feel better,

then I'm happy to do it.

WOLF

Well, how did it come up?

WANDA

He asked me if I liked jazz, I said

yes, and he suggested we meet tonight

at a jazz club.

WOLF

I like jazz.

WANDA

He did not invite you.

(applies perfume)

WOLF

Why are you wearing perfume to work?

WANDA

Because I feel like it.

WOLF

You didn't wear it yesterday.

WANDA

Oh, stop it. You're acting like a

child.

WOLF

My eye!

WANDA

Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?

WOLF

Do I look alright?!

WANDA

Let me see. Christ, we're going to

be late.

NICK

Should we call up to the room again?

JEFF

He said he'd be right down.

JEFF

Tired?

NICK

I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the

set all night. I was just trying to

do one shot and everything kept going

wrong.

JEFF

That's an anxiety dream. Are you

anxious about something?

NICK

I don't know. Sometimes I wonder

what the hell I'm doing in this

business. It's all just one compromise

and disappointment after another. I

don't know if I have the personality

for it.

JEFF

Sounds kind of like an identity

crisis.

NICK

Maybe you're right. Who am I? What

am I really capable of? Maybe I should

just get a job teaching at a women's

college somewhere.

JEFF

How'd you get into cinematography?

NICK

I'm not a cinematographer.

JEFF

You're not?

NICK

No. I'm directing this movie.

JEFF

(pause)

How'd you get into directing?

PALOMINO

They're waiting downstairs.

WOMAN

Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.

PALOMINO

Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell

you, I had a lot of fun last night,

really, but for me, where I'm at

right now in my life, a relationship

is...

WOMAN

Chad; hold it. This was a one-time

deal. You know it, I know it. There

is no need for melodrama.

PALOMINO

I just thought you might...

WOMAN

Look, all I ask is that you don't

mention this to anyone.

PALOMINO

Hey, that's not my style.

WOMAN

Good.

PALOMINO

So, I'll see you on the set.

NICOLE

God damn it.

PALOMINO

I got two films coming up right after

yours, Nick. One I play a rapist

that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love

with. The other I'm kind of a sexy

serial killer who shacks up with

Winona Ryder.

NICK

That's great, man.

PALOMINO

Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess

twinkie shit, Nick.

NICK

Hostess twinkie?

PALOMINO

That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff,

man. These are the kind of movies I

want to do, right here.

NICK

I'm glad you feel that way, Chad.

And I just want to tell you, I'm

really happy we can work together.

PALOMINO

Hey, me too! You're a great director,

man. Your films are wacked! And I'm

gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a

hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick.

I'm gonna pick your brain.

NICK

Good. Then you can pick my nose.

PALOMINO

(big laugh)

See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey,

what are we sitting here for?

NICK

We're waiting for Nicole.

PALOMINO

Nicole? She's takin' a tax --

(he stops)

NICK

What?

PALOMINO

Probably taking a shower or something.

Hey, how was her shower scene in

that Richard Gere movie?

NICK

Good.

JEFF

Really great.

GAFFER

I think we got nudity today.

AC

(reads from his

callsheet)

It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and

Damian kiss."

GAFFER

Could be a kiss with nudity.

AC

I like Ellen. She's my type.

GAFFER

Why is that?

AC

She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.

GAFFER

Maybe I'll give her a part. That's

right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty

soon.

AC

Oh yeah?

GAFFER

Yup. Feature. I brought my script.

GAFFER

Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm

going to give it to him right during

lunch. Maybe right after.

AC

Alright.

GAFFER

Got to be aggressive. You want to

shoot it?

AC

Sure.

GAFFER

You ever shot anything?

AC

No.

GAFFER

That's alright; got to start

somewhere.

NICK

Jesus, what are you doing?

LORDE

Shrinking tissue. That's what this

stuff is for. Let that sit for two

minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.

NICK

How'd you get here?

NICOLE

Took a taxi.

NICK

Oh. We've been waiting in front of

your apartment for half an hour.

NICOLE

God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came

up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I

feel like such an asshole.

NICK

You're just saying that because you

have Preparation H on your face.

NICOLE

I never should have gone out last

night. I hate jazz. God, I look

terrible.

NICK

No you don't.

NICOLE

Don't bullshit me, Nick.

NICK

I'm not. You really look beautiful.

PALOMINO

Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?

NICOLE

I took a cab.

PALOMINO

Oh, cause we were wondering how you

got here.

NICK

Alright, good; everybody's here.

We'll do a run-through as soon as

you guys are ready.

PALOMINO

You got it, Chief.

WANDA

Hold it down, hold it down, people.

Actors working.

PALOMINO

Great shirt, Wanda.

WANDA

(big smile)

Why, thank you, Chad.

NICK

OK, let's work out the rest of this

blocking. Wolf --

(notices Wolf's

eyepatch)

What happened to your eye?

WOLF

A little accident.

NICK

You going to be alright?

WOLF

I think so.

PALOMINO

It looks good on you, man.

NICK

Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're

there by the chair. Camera is close

on Ellen: her first line.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Admired? That sounds rather

professional.

NICK

Good! "Professional," that's the

cue; Damian steps up to the bed.

Camera pulls back. The scene

continues.

NICOLE

Well, then: loved. How does that

sound?

PALOMINO

It sounds like the champagne talking.

NICOLE

I've loved you from the moment we

met.

PALOMINO

Why didn't you tell me?

NICOLE

We were working together. I didn't

want anything to interfere.

PALOMINO

God. And all this time I thought...

NICK

Then the kiss. How's that feel?

PALOMINO

Great.

NICK

Nicole?

NICOLE

Good.

NICK

Wolf, any thoughts?

WOLF

Nope.

PALOMINO

I've got a thought. What about Damian

having an eyepatch like Wolf's?

NICK

Let me think about that one, Chad.

PALOMINO

OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve,

Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take

One. Let's shoot it!

NICK

One second, Chad. You ready for one,

Wolf?

WOLF

Hell, I been ready.

PALOMINO

Alright, Wolfman.

NICK

Good. Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take one!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Admired? That sounds rather

professional.

NICOLE

Well, then: loved. How does that

sound?

PALOMINO

It sounds like the champagne talking.

NICOLE

I've loved you from the moment we

met.

PALOMINO

(finally moves to his

mark)

Why didn't you tell me?

NICOLE

We were working together. I didn't

want anything to interfere.

PALOMINO

God. And all this time I thought...

NICK

Cut. Very good.

WOLF

Not for camera. Chad was completely

out of frame.

NICK

Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy?

Forget your cue?

PALOMINO

Oh no, man. I held back. It really

felt like something Damian would do;

holding back to the last moment.

NICK

Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?

WOLF

I don't care when he moves. Just

give me a fucking cue.

PALOMINO

The Lone Wolf!

NICK

What line did he move on?

SCRIPT

"Why didn't you tell me?"

NICK

Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole,

how does that feel to you?

NICOLE

Fine, if that's what Chad wants to

do.

PALOMINO

"Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's

shoot; I'm stoked!

NICK

One second, Chad.

NICK

Chad, how would you describe this

scene, in one word?

PALOMINO

Great. It's a great scene, man.

NICK

No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?

PALOMINO

Definitely.

NICK

These two people really love each

other. And we want to see that,

especially in the kiss.

PALOMINO

Hey, say no more, Chief.

NICK

Nicole?

NICOLE

I understand, Chief.

NICK

Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take two!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Admired? That sounds rather

professional.

NICOLE

Well, then: loved. How does that

sound?

PALOMINO

It sounds like the champagne talking.

NICOLE

I've loved you from the moment we

met.

PALOMINO

Why didn't you tell me?

NICOLE

We were working together. I didn't

want anything to interfere.

PALOMINO

God. And all this time I thought...

NICK

And, cut. Very good. Wolf?

WOLF

Chad missed his cue again; the whole

dolly is unusable.

NICK

Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought

you were going to hold back till

"me"?

PALOMINO

The more I thought about it the more

it didn't seem right. And I'm

thinking, watch me here, instead of

coming around the bed, what if I

just slip here like this and do the

whole scene lying down?

NICK

I don't know, that seems a little...

PALOMINO

Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas

here. Trying to get the juices

flowing.

NICK

Nicole, how does that feel to you?

NICOLE

Well, I can turn to look at him. But

won't you be shooting the back of my

head?

WOLF

Plus Chad is completely out of the

light down there.

PALOMINO

Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my

face, man. It's about the acting;

that's all I care about.

WOLF

It's your call, Nick. His acting or

his face.

NICK

For some reason I was hoping we could

get both.

(laughs)

I thought that's what we were trying

to do here.

WOLF

I'll have to set another light.

WANDA

We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I

think we can afford a few minutes to

set a light for Mr. Palomino.

NICK

Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian;

let's talk for a second.

WANDA

We'll pause to set this light and go

again right away. How long, Wolf?

WANDA

Wolf?

NICK

OK, let's make sure we know what's

going on here. These two people have

loved each other for years, each of

them not knowing the other was in

love with them. And tonight, in this

little room it all comes out. It's

like a dam bursting. Does that make

sense? Nicole?

NICOLE

It makes perfect sense. I just haven't

found it yet. I'll get it though.

NICK

What about you, Chad?

PALOMINO

I'm there, man. I got the dam going,

the river, everything. You watch,

that little change in the blocking

is going to open the whole scene up

for me.

WANDA (V.O.)

We're ready, Nick!

NICK

Good. Let's go.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take three!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Admired? That sounds rather

professional.

NICOLE

Well, then: loved. How does that

sound?

PALOMINO

It sounds like the champagne talking.

NICOLE

I've loved you from the moment we

met.

PALOMINO

Why didn't you tell me?

NICOLE

We were working together -- I'm sorry,

can we cut, Nick?

NICK

Cut!

WANDA

That's a cut!

PALOMINO

Dammit! That was a good one!

NICOLE

I know, I'm sorry. But this feels

really awkward; turning all the way

around like this.

NICK

Yeah, I think the lying on the bed

is not quite working, Chad. Let's

try one with the original blocking.

PALOMINO

Which one was that? There's been so

many damn changes. Could somebody

help me out please?

SCRIPT

The cue for the original blocking is

"professional."

PALOMINO

(intimate)

Thank you. Thank you very much.

NICK

OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.

NICOLE

Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is

that alright?

NICK

Of course, Nicole; are you kidding?

Hold the roll, Wanda.

WANDA

Holding the roll!

PALOMINO

(whispers)

Someone over here smells very, very

nice.

NICK

(with quiet intensity)

Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

And roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take four!

PALOMINO

(suddenly)

Nick, I just had a great idea!

WANDA

Hold the roll!

NICK

What is it, Chad?

PALOMINO

Just stop me if I'm out of line here,

but she says "admired from afar,"

right? Doesn't it make sense to see

Damian up close and her "afar?" You

start on a Close-up of Damian, watch

me here; as she declares her love,

the camera moves with me into this

primo two-shot that you and the

Wolfmeister have set up here.

NICK

What do you think, Wolf?

WOLF

I don't like it. This is Ellen's

scene.

NICK

I don't know; it sort of makes sense.

PALOMINO

Hey, you did it, man. It's all there

in the writing.

WOLF

I'd have to relight.

WANDA

We're still ahead of schedule, Nick;

if that means anything to you.

NICK

Let's do it.

WOLF

(to the Gaffer)

Get me a tweenie right here, with

diffusion.

WANDA

OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing

briefly to set one little light,

then we're going again, right away.

Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.

GAFFER

I'll do it.

WOLF

Get the fucking light!

SCRIPT

Thanks.

PALOMINO

My pleasure. Sugar?

SCRIPT

Just a bit.

PALOMINO

You like jazz?

SCRIPT

Very much.

PALOMINO

Maybe we could go hear some tonight.

WANDA

It's going well I think. Don't you

think?

SCRIPT

Very well. What time do you think

we'll finish?

WANDA

Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz

club tonight.

SCRIPT

Really? So am I. He's wonderful,

isn't he?

WANDA

Chad?

SCRIPT

He's so natural, like... air.

SCRIPT

I wonder what his sign is. Do you

know, Nicole?

NICOLE

I don't know his sign, but I think

his moon is in Uranus.

SCRIPT

You don't have to be nasty.

PALOMINO

Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?

WOLF

Until you change it. Where's my

fucking eyepatch?!

GAFFER

Hey, Chad.

PALOMINO

Hey, whatya say.

GAFFER

I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.

PALOMINO

Chad Palomino; Actor.

GAFFER

(big smile)

I know.

PALOMINO

(to the ac)

Hey, what's your name?

AC

Maurice.

PALOMINO

Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any

relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking

crew guys, really.

GAFFER

Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a

script.

PALOMINO

Oh, yeah?

PALOMINO

Hey, Bill. See that light over there?

GAFFER

Uh, yeah.

PALOMINO

Lower it about three feet.

NICK

Would you care to have a drink

tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you

say you and I have a drink tonight?

NICOLE

Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!

NICK

That's OK, no problem. I'm just

slapping a little water on my face.

NICK

So, it's going pretty good, huh?

NICOLE

Is it? Something feels off.

NICK

Yeah, you seem a little tense.

NICOLE

Do I?

NICK

But don't worry about it. Just take

your attention off yourself and put

it on Chad. Work off him a little

more.

NICOLE

OK, I'll try that.

NICK

And listen, I know he's no Olivier.

But he's got something, don't you

think? Kind of a natural presence.

NICOLE

Oh yes, he's very natural.

NICK

So Nicole... anything else I can

help you with?

NICOLE

Actually there is. Could you maybe

ask him to brush his teeth?

NICK

Oh, sure.

WOLF

My eye is killing me.

WANDA

Put your eyepatch on.

WOLF

I lost it.

WANDA

Is that little light set yet?

WOLF

That little light was set ten minutes

ago.

WANDA

(into her walkie)

Get me the A Team in here right away.

Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino.

(to Wolf)

Why didn't you tell me?

WOLF

Hey, you're not worried about the

time, I'm not worried about the time.

WANDA

Oh, I am very worried about the time!

WOLF

I know you are.

WANDA

What is that supposed to mean?

WOLF

What do you think it means?!

WANDA

I don't know what it means!

WOLF

Oh yes you do, you know exactly what

it means.

WANDA

I have no idea what you're talking

about! Why are you --

WOLF

You don't understand me, Wanda! You

have no idea --

WANDA

I don't understand you?!! All I do

is take care of you!!!

NICK

Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going

on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a

very intimate scene and a lot of

tension on the set doesn't help. OK?

Now, Wolf, let's just go through the

first part of the move. Damian, on

your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian;

Ellen in the background.

NICK

Chad, what are you doing?

WOLF

Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.

PALOMINO

Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm

telling you, Nick; it really feels

right. I feel like this guy now,

man.

NICK

I don't know, Chad. I don't think it

works.

PALOMINO

You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight

you on this one.

WOLF

Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I

don't want anyone wearing it. It's

insanitary.

PALOMINO

Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send

someone out for an eyepatch. I'll

fucking pay for it myself.

NICK

Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say

this in front of Wolf but it makes

you look a little... gay.

PALOMINO

Really?

NICK

Yeah, a little bit.

PALOMINO

Jesus.

PALOMINO

You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good

call.

WANDA

Are you ready, Nick?

NICK

One second. You need a rehearsal,

Wolf?

WOLF

Let's just fucking shoot it!!

PALOMINO

El Lobo!

NICK

Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take four!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Admired? That sounds rather

professional.

NICOLE

Well, then: loved. How does that

sound?

PALOMINO

It sounds like the champagne talking.

NICOLE

I've loved you from the moment we

met.

PALOMINO

Why didn't you tell me?

NICOLE

We were working together. I didn't

want anything to interfere -- God!

NICK

Cut!

WANDA

That's a cut. Hold the work, going

again, right away.

NICOLE

I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I

did that. I'm sorry.

PALOMINO

Nick, could I talk to you a second?

WANDA

A momentary delay. Everyone stand

by. We're going again, right away.

SOUND

Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low

on that take.

NICOLE

Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually

could I listen to the take before?

PALOMINO

I'm out of here, man!

NICK

What's the matter?!

PALOMINO

I like you, but I made a big mistake

taking this part. Have someone call

me a cab.

NICK

Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to

me. What's going on!?

PALOMINO

I can't act with this woman. I know

she's a friend of yours but I got to

tell you: she cannot act worth a

shit! I'm giving her everything! The

whole thing I just did with the hair;

did you see that? I came up with

that on my own because I thought it

would help her. But no, she's giving

me nothing! I'm out of here.

PALOMINO

God, and all this time I thought...

(the muted rustle of

the kiss)

PALOMINO (V.O.)

Why did you cast her? She sucked in

that Richard Gere movie!

NICK (V.O.)

You're right. She is not the best

actress in the world. I see that now

but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm

asking you to please help me here.

We've got to get through this somehow.

PALOMINO

I'll tell you what this is about,

man. You know why she took a cab

this morning?

NICK

Something came up.

PALOMINO

No. She was in my hotel room and she

didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm

sorry it had to come out like this

but I told her this morning "thanks

a lot, it was a lot of fun last night

but let's get something straight --

it was just a one-time deal," and

she didn't want to hear that. She

wanted more, you see what I'm saying?

It's rejection.

NICK

Nicole, listen...

NICOLE

Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't

working. I apologize. Chad, I

apologize to you too. I'm completely

unfocused here and I think you're

absolutely right; what we need to do

is loosen the scene up somehow.

NICK

What would you like to do?

NICOLE

I was wondering if we could try

improvising the scene. More along

the lines of what Chad has been doing.

Maybe that would help me find

something.

NICK

That's a fantastic idea. What do you

think, Chad?

PALOMINO

Hey, that's the only way I can work.

Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.

NICK

Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why

not?!

PALOMINO

Roll that motherfucking camera,

Wolfie!

WOLF

Kiss my ass!

PALOMINO

Yeah! Let's go!

NICK

Alright, now we're making a fucking

movie! Call it, Wanda!

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take five!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I've always admired you from afar.

PALOMINO

Have you? That's, wow; that's

incredible. But that sounds kind of

professional doesn't it? Admired?

NICOLE

You're right. How does despised sound?

PALOMINO

Great!

(laughs)

What's it mean?

NICOLE

(laughs)

It's sort of like I think you're a

piece of shit.

PALOMINO

(another laugh)

That sounds like the champagne

talking.

NICOLE

It's not. I really do think you are

a piece of shit.

PALOMINO

No, you don't. You love me.

NICOLE

The fuck I do. I can't stand looking

at you!

PALOMINO

Then I guess I have nothing else to

say.

NICOLE

No, I think you have a lot more to

say, Damian.

PALOMINO

Well, I am surprised you feel this

way, Ellen. I always thought you

admired --

NICOLE

That's not what I meant. You should

tell everyone what you just told

Nick behind the set.

PALOMINO

Hey, this isn't part of the scene.

NICOLE

Say it anyway: The reason this scene

isn't working is because you and I

slept together last night. Did

everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad

last night!

PALOMINO

See, Nick! I told you this was about

rejection!

NICOLE

You fucking scumbag! You think I

give a rat's ass about you?! I was

there to get laid and even that was

a joke!

PALOMINO

You know, you are really starting to

piss me off!

NICOLE

Oh, does that mean you're not going

to come wiggle on the bed anymore,

or stroke my hair real soft and

concerned, or kiss me like a soap

opera acting piece of shit!

NICOLE

Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come

on!

NICK

OK, guys, I think we can stop there.

PALOMINO

You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda,

call me a cab!

NICK

Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to

calm down.

PALOMINO

Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This

movie is bullshit.

NICK

Now wait a second, Chad. There's no

reason for hostility.

PALOMINO

Shut up, you fucking loser. The only

reason I took this part was because

someone said you knew Quentin

Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.

NICK

Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of

your shit, you hostess twinkie

motherfucker!

PALOMINO

What'd you call me?

NICK

You heard me.

PALOMINO

Say it again.

NICK

You hostess twinkie motherfucker!

WANDA

Alright, everyone just stop. Stop!

Stop this right now!

WOLF

Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!

WANDA

(shrieks)

Wolf!

NICOLE

Oh, God!

NICK

You want to pick my brain?! This is

the way I direct hostess twinkie

scumbags like you!

NICK

Get him out of here! Someone take

him back to his hotel!

SCRIPT

(sniffling)

Chad...

NICK

Are you alright?

NICOLE

Don't touch me.

GAFFER

It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese

tidal wave hits New York. You've an

ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working

undercover. You save the city. You'd

be perfect for the lead. That's my

number; call me, or I'll call you.

Either way it's been great working

with you, man.

NICK

Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

You were great in that Richard Gere

movie.

NICOLE

Shut up. You're no different than he

is. You lie, you're deceitful...

NICK

I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone

how great you are. I've got nothing

but respect and admiration for you.

NICOLE

Oh God, now you're doing your own

fucking script.

NICK

Well, why do you think I wrote it?!

NICOLE

I have no idea!

NICK

It's about you. It's about how I

feel about you.

NICOLE

Christ, did you get a bump on your

head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking

like an idiot.

NICK

Nicole. I've loved you since the day

we met.

NICOLE

Why didn't you tell me?

NICK

I didn't want anything to get in the

way of us working together.

NICOLE

God, and all this time I thought...

NICOLE

Oh, God.

WANDA

Don't go out that door!

AC

Why not?

WANDA

It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now

go around.

AC

Next time. This is an emergency.

WANDA

(into her walkie)

Has Ellen showed up yet?

WALKIE

ssss... kkkkkrrk.

WANDA

Get her into wardrobe right away.

WALKIE

ssskk... ssssrrrk?

WANDA

No! Scene six; Scene five has been

postponed. I'm not going to say it

again; Mr. Palomino is not working

today. Now where is that smoke

machine!

AC

Oh. Sorry.

TITO

What do you want?!

AC

I need to use the bathroom. Kind of

an emergency.

TITO

Well, fucking knock!!

TITO

(muttering)

I swear to Christ, one of these days

I'm going to punch somebody in the

balls!

NICK

Just as we pull up to your apartment

Palomino suddenly says he feels so

sick he can't work today.

NICOLE

God. Was it something he ate?

SACHIKO

Stand up, please.

NICK

I don't know.

NICOLE

Can he work tomorrow?

SACHIKO

Turn around, please.

NICK

Don't know that either. But I'm not

worrying about it. I had this dream

last night where I was on the set.

You were in it, and another woman,

someone older. Anyway, everything

was going wrong. The harder I tried

to hold things together the more

they fell apart. And you know what

that dream was telling me, Nicole?

You just got to roll with it. And

that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling

with it. So, we'll just shoot the

Dream Sequence today.

NICK

Hey, Tito. You look great, man.

TITO

I feel like shit.

NICK

No, you look good. Thanks for coming

in on such short notice. This is

Nicole; she's playing Ellen.

NICOLE

Hello. Toto, is it?

TITO

Tito.

NICOLE

Oh, I'm sorry.

NICK

Listen, if there's anything I can do

to make you... if you need... uh,

just let me know.

TITO

Put a stool in the bathroom.

NICK

Did I just offend him?

NICOLE

What did you say?

NICK

"Short notice?"

NICOLE

Come on; that was nothing. I'm the

one who called him "Toto." Jesus,

I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the

set last night too.

NICK

Oh yeah?

NICOLE

Yeah. You were in the dream.

NICK

Was I freaking out?

NICOLE

Actually, you were.

NICK

That's great: I freak out in my dream;

I freak out in your dream. No wonder

I'm fucking exhausted.

NICOLE

Nick...

NICK

Yeah?

WOLF

Alright, guys; special effects today.

Could be fun. Who knows how to work

this baby?

GAFFER

It's the old T-160. I used it once

in '85.

AC

Damn. '85.

WOLF

What's this?

GAFFER

That's where the gas goes.

BOOM

No, that's where the oil goes.

GAFFER

Is it?

BOOM

I think so.

GAFFER

You're right. It's coming back now.

WOLF

I'm going to let you handle this

one, Bob. This is your baby. And

Les, if he needs help you give him a

hand. OK, guys? We're all working

together today.

GAFFER

Yup, all coming back now. Like riding

a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.

AC

Way to go, Bob.

NICK

How are we doing, Wanda?

WANDA

Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not

good. We need to finish this scene

and do Scene thirty-one today.

NICK

Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes

for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't

know we were --

WANDA

Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to

your apartment to pick them up. Now,

relax.

NICK

Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment

to pick them up; it's the red

notebook, under the bed.

WANDA

It's taken care of, Nick.

NICK

Good. Great. Good.

WOLF

We're all lit, the smoke machine is

under control; we're ready to go.

WANDA

(hard)

What about the dolly?

WOLF

Just need to see a run-through and

we're all set. I'm going to make

your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful.

(he slips his arm

around her)

Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume.

And don't worry about Palomino; I'll

take you to a jazz club tonight.

WANDA

Oh, I can't make it. I have to go

see Chad; he's extremely ill.

WOLF

Oh, by the way my eye's much better.

WANDA

Listen, Wolf, this may not be the

best time to say this but our

relationship is going nowhere.

WOLF

What do you mean?

WANDA

Please, don't take it personally.

Because I care for you, Wolf, I really

do. But I've had this feeling for

quite a while and I think it's time

we ended it. OK?

WOLF

(pause)

OK.

WANDA

I think it's better.

WOLF

So do I.

WANDA

Well, good. Still friends?

WOLF

Sure.

WANDA

Great, cause we still have to work

together and there's no reason it

has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.

WANDA

You're a real special guy, Wolf.

WOLF

Thanks.

WANDA

(into her walkie)

OK, let's get the A Team in please!

Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!

NICK

OK, here's the shot. We start wide

with Ellen standing absolutely still

right in the middle of the frame.

You got that, Wolf?

WOLF

Yeah.

NICK

(notices eyepatch)

What happened to your eye?

WOLF

Nothing. It's a little sensitive

today.

NICK

Can you see?

WOLF

(snaps)

Of course I can see!

NICK

OK, Ellen is standing there. The

smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's

line.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

NICK

Good, Tito, that's your cue.

NICK

You walk around her once, hold the

apple out, that's right; just beyond

her reach. You're staring at her

hard. Harder, good. Then stop right

here. Can we get a mark, please?

NICK

Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up.

Alright, Wolf?

WANDA

It should be hand-held.

NICK

No, I think it's better on the dolly.

WOLF

Whatever.

NICOLE

Nick, do I see him?

NICK

No, just the apple. And Tito, right

after we dolly in give me a little

laugh there.

TITO

A little laugh?

NICK

Big, little; anything you feel like

doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one.

Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

OK, here we go. Camera back to One.

Action on the smoke.

WANDA

And roll sound.

NICK

Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little

more smoke? Is that possible?

GAFFER

Oh, sure.

NICK

Good. Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take one!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

NICK

And... cut.

WANDA

That's a cut. Nick; comments?

NICK

Yeah, just a couple. I thought that

was uh... good. Tito, that was very

good, man, really. You didn't feel

like laughing?

TITO

I laughed.

NICK

Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You

could make it bigger if you want.

And Ellen, maybe just a little more

tension when you see him.

NICOLE

I thought I didn't see him.

NICK

Right, maybe you see him a little

bit.

NICOLE

Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him

or not?

NICK

You see him.

NICOLE

OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?

TITO

(hard)

It's Tito.

NICOLE

(alarmed)

What did I say?

TITO

Toto.

NICOLE

Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't

know why I'm doing that. I'm really

sorry.

NICK

Ellen, come on now; concentrate.

Remember; you're marrying Damian

tomorrow. You're a little anxious.

You have this dream. Let's call it

an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents

the anxiety.

NICK

OK? It seems pretty simple.

NICOLE

Let's just try it.

NICK

Good. And Bob, let's really have

some smoke on this one.

GAFFER

OK, more smoke.

WOLF

I still think it should be hand-held.

NICK

Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-

held. I want it on the dolly. Where's

my notebook, Wanda?

WANDA

On it's way, Nick.

NICK

Good. Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Lock it up. Going for picture. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take two!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

NICK

Cut.

WANDA

That's a cut. Going again, Nick?

NICK

Yes.

WANDA

Going again, please stand by.

NICK

OK, Ellen, good. You're on to

something there.

NICOLE

No, something's not right. It all

feels fake to me.

NICK

Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just

remember, you really want the apple.

Tito, I still think we could see

more of a laugh at the end.

TITO

What kind of laugh?

NICK

Just a laugh.

TITO

Show me.

NICK

Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe

like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

NICK

Something like that. OK? And remember,

Tito, this is a dream. Not everything

has to make sense. A laugh right

there heightens our sense of... of...

TITO

Anxiety.

NICK

Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?

WOLF

I still think it should be hand-held.

NICK

(snaps)

Well, God damn it! It's not going to

be! It's on the dolly so just forget

about it!

NICK

And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke?

Might as well get a couple hamsters

in here blowing smoke rings for

Christ's sake.

GAFFER

The septic valve wasn't open. I got

it now. We're going to see some smoke

now.

NICK

Alright, let's try another take.

WANDA

And, lock it up.

WOLF

Nick, could I talk to you for a

minute?

NICK

What?!

WOLF

In private.

NICK

(sighs in exasperation)

Alright.

WANDA

Release the lock-up. Everyone stand

by.

GAFFER

We'll see some smoke now.

AC

Way to go, Bob.

WOLF

I really don't like being spoken to

like that, Nick!

NICK

Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!

WOLF

I don't have an attitude!

NICK

The hell you don't! Every time I ask

you to do something all I get is No,

No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired

you to do a job; if you're not going

to do it you better let me know right

now!

WOLF

I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through

some heavy shit.

NICK

What do you mean?

WOLF

I can't really go into it. It's pretty

heavy.

NICK

Personal?

WOLF

Personal, professional, emotional.

It's doing a number on me. And now

you're telling me you're going to

fire me.

NICK

I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on,

I'm not going to fire you. You're

doing a great job here.

WOLF

Am I?

NICK

Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without

you, man. You've got a great eye. I

just hope it's not the one under

that eyepatch.

NICK

Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one

thing I've learned; sometimes you

just have to roll with things. You

know?

WOLF

You're right.

NICK

Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.

WOLF

Thanks, bro.

BOOM

That's where the oil goes.

GAFFER

No, that's where the gas goes.

BOOM

I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where

the oil goes.

SOUND

Lester, don't you think Bob knows

where the oil goes?!

GAFFER

I don't remember using oil in '85.

AC

Maybe both the oil and gas go in

there?

BOOM

I think he's right.

GAFFER

I think he is too. OK, three parts

gas, one part oil.

NICK

Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?

WANDA

Any minute, Nick.

NICK

Good. Call it, Wanda.

WANDA

Going for picture. Lock it up. And

roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take three!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

NICK

Cut! Cut! Cut!

WANDA

Turn it off! Turn it off!

GAFFER

I can't find the switch!

WOLF

Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!

WANDA

Open the door! Get some water!

GAFFER

I got it! I got it!

WANDA

Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please

step off the set!

TITO (V.O.)

I'm off the set!

NICOLE (V.O.)

So am I.

WANDA

Then who is that? Who is that? Please

step off the set!

CORA

Hi, Nicky.

NICK

Mom!

WANDA

Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat,

blue slippers. How do I know? Because

she's sitting ten feet away from me.

Well sweetheart, that's going to be

a real fucking problem.

JEFF

She was waiting outside Nick's

apartment when I went to pick up his

notebook. She said she was looking

for him so I figured I should just

bring her up here. You look really

pretty in that dress.

NICK

How did you get here?

CORA

I took a bus in; went right to your

apartment.

NICK

How did you get out of your room?

CORA

Oh, I just went right through the

door.

NICK

It was unlocked!?

CORA

No, it was locked. I just went through

it. It's something I've learned to

do, Nicky. I can walk through just

about anything; like air.

NICK

Mom, you've got to stop doing this.

I'm serious. I'm a little upset with

you. You could have gotten lost, or

hurt.

CORA

I wanted to see you. I've missed

you.

NICK

I know, Mom; I've missed you too.

But it's not really a good time.

NICOLE

They're sending a car. It should be

here in a couple of hours. They didn't

even know she was gone.

NICK

Jesus, I don't believe this.

CORA

I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was

going to be a wedding I would have

worn my fucking hat.

NICK

There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?

CORA

Is the little fellow going to do

gymnastics?

NICK

Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've

got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet.

OK?

CORA

(whispers)

OK.

WANDA

How are you doing?

WOLF

Good; real good.

NICK

How's the smoke machine?

WANDA

It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out

to every Effects house in the city

but I just can't seem to locate --

NICK

Forget it. We'll shoot without it.

WANDA

But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.

NICK

That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're

just going to have to roll with it.

Nothing else we can do. We've got to

roll with it, right, Wolf?

NICK

OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to

keep reaching for that apple. I don't

feel that you really want it. I mean,

Christ, how many times do I have to

tell you!

WANDA

Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going

again, right away.

NICK

Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?

NICOLE

You tell me! You're the one with the

bug up your ass!

NICK

Now wait just a second!

NICOLE

You've been picking on me all day! I

can't do anything right!

NICK

I'm sorry if I was short with you,

Nicole, but I think you can see I'm

under a little pressure here. I'm

shooting a Dream Sequence without a

smoke machine, my mother's out there

thinking she's at a circus wedding

and you tell me the whole movie seems

fake!

NICOLE

I never said that!

NICK

You did too. You said, "Everything

feels fake."

NICOLE

I meant me! I feel fake! Everything

I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I

should just do shower scenes in

Richard Gere movies for the rest of

my life!

NICK

Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a

fantastic actress. All you have to

do is show me you want that apple

more than anything else in the world;

don't give up. Understand? You cannot

give up.

NICOLE

OK.

WANDA

Ready, Nick?!

NICK

Ready!

NICK

OK, here we go. Everybody focus,

concentrate. And Tito, we're still

looking for that little laugh, pal.

OK? Call it, Wanda!

WANDA

Picture's up. There will be no smoke

in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in

the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.

SOUND

Speed!

WANDA

Roll camera!

AC

Rolling!

CLAPPER

Scene six, take four!

NICK

And, action.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

CORA

Oh, I thought this was the TV room.

NICK

Cut!

WANDA

That's a cut. Going again, right

away.

NICK

Mom, listen to me. I don't want you

to move from this chair. Do you

understand?

CORA

Oh Jesus, you sound just like your

father...

NICK

Mom, I'm serious.

CORA

OK, OK. I won't move.

NICK

Thank you.

NICK

OK, good. Very good.

(laughs)

Tito, I think we're having a little

communication problem here. All I

want you to do is laugh. OK?

TITO

Why?

NICK

I told you why.

TITO

Tell me again.

NICK

Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal.

It's a dream, alright. Strange things

happen in a dream. All you have to

do is laugh. Why is that such a

problem?

TITO

Why does it have to be a dwarf?

NICK

What?

TITO

Why does my character have to be a

dwarf?

NICK

He doesn't have to be a dwarf.

TITO

Then why is he?! Is that the only

way you can make this a dream; put a

dwarf in it?

NICK

No, Tito; that's not --

TITO

Have you ever had a dream with a

dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone

who's had a dream with a dwarf in

it? NO! I don't even have dreams

with dwarves in them! The only place

I've seen dwarves in dreams is in

stupid movies like this! Make it

weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone

will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a

dream, there's a fucking dwarf in

it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can

take this Dream Sequence and shove

it up your ass!

WANDA

Nick?

(no response)

I can get right on the phone. We'll

try to get another... small person

here as soon as possible.

NICK

No. He's absolutely right.

WOLF

You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick?

She could be in the dream by herself.

NICK

No. We're not going to shoot anything.

I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help,

but it's over. I can't take it

anymore. I tried to roll with it but

it's time to face the music; I can't

do this. I am not a director. The

shoot is over. I give up.

WOLF

Take the camera off the dolly. Start

putting it away.

CORA

Give me that apple!

CORA

(behind the door)

I'm ready, Nick!

NICK

Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go.

Right away.

NICOLE

I am so hungry.

NICK

And cut!!

NICK

Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get

it?

WOLF

Got it, Nick! Everything!

NICK

The Close-up?

WOLF

Perfect. See? That's what I meant

about going hand-held!

NICK

You're a genius, man! What about the

focus?!

AC

Nailed it.

WOLF

Fuckin' A!

WANDA

Going again, Nick?

NICK

How was the sound?

SOUND

I could use another but definitely

acceptable.

NICK

Mom, you kook! That was incredible!

Did you know we were filming?

CORA

(testily)

Of course I knew you were filming.

NICK

You were great, you're a natural.

And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't

you dare tell me that felt fake.

WANDA

Going again, Nick?

NICK

Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.

NICK

Can I use it for the Dream Sequence,

that's the question. Does it work

for the Dream Sequence?

NICK

We're going with it, Wanda!

WANDA

Alright everyone, listen up. That is

a wrap on Scene Six.

SOUND

Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

WANDA

What?!

SOUND

I need to record room tone. I'll

need thirty seconds of silence.

WANDA

Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!!

Thirty seconds of room tone. The

sooner you're quiet the sooner we're

done.

CORA

(whispers to Nick)

What's room tone?

NICK

It's for the sound, Mom. We just

have to be quiet.

WANDA

And roll sound. Nobody move.

SOUND

Speed.

CHAD

We have a new category this year:

Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being.

And the winner is none other than my

Best Bud, Nick Reve!

MAN

Had any experience?

NICOLE

I was an actress for a while.

MAN

Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?

NICOLE

(doubtfully)

Probably.

WANDA

Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me

one more chance. Let me prove it! I

love you! I love you, Wolf!

WANDA

What I love about you, Chad, is you're

not afraid of my power.

CHAD

Oh God, Wanda! I love your power.

It's like an afferdesiac to me!

NICK

In closing I'd like to say to all

the people who told me not to make

this movie, who wouldn't meet with

me or return a simple phone call. To

my favorite professor at Film School

whose parting advice to me was to

take a job teaching at a women's

college. To Delores DelSporto, the

girl I loved in high school who left

me for a Jr. Varsity football player:

to all these people I'd like to say

thank you but I can't because what I

really feel like saying is go fu --

!!

SOUND

And, that's a cut on room tone.

WANDA

OK, strike the set. Props! Art

Department! Redress for Scene thirty-

one. Let's go! Right away people!

Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!

THE END
