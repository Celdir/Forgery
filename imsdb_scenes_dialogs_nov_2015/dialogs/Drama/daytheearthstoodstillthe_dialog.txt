THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL

"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"

by

Edmund H. North

Revised final draft

February 21, 1951

BRITISH ANNOUNCER

Reports are coming in from all over

the Empire -- from all over the world.

The Government have not yet issued a

statement, but there seems to be no

question that there actually is a

large, unidentified object circling

the earth at incredible speed.

AMERICAN ANNOUNCER

(staccato with

excitement)

We still don't know what it is or

where it's from - but we do know

there's something there. It's been

tracked around the world by radar

traveling at a rate of four thousand

miles an hour.

2ND RADIO REPORTER

(voice off scene)

This is not another "flying saucer"

scare. Scientists and military men

have already agreed on that. Whatever

this is -- it's something real.

3RD RADIO REPORTER

(voice off scene)

We interrupt this program to give

you a bulletin just received from

one of our naval units at sea. "A

large object, traveling at supersonic

speed, is headed over the North

Atlantic toward the east coast of

the United States."

4TH RADIO REPORTER

(with deliberately

controlled calm)

Here in the nation's capital, there

is anxiety and concern, but no outward

sign of panic. As a matter of fact,

there are signs of normalcy that

seem strangely out of place; the

beautiful spring weather, the tourist

crowds at the various monuments and

public buildings...

MAN

They're here! They're here!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BRIGADIER GENERAL

(into phone)

Get me the Chief of Staff.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL

I want to speak to the President.

(listens for a moment)

I'm sorry -- you'll have to interrupt

him.

DISSOLVE TO:

PEARSON

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

this is Drew Pearson. We bring you

this special radio-television

broadcast to give you the latest

information on the landing of the

"space ship" in Washington.

PEARSON

Government and Defense Department

officials are concerned by reports

of panic in several large Eastern

cities. I am authorized to assure

you that so far there is no reasonable

cause for alarm. The rumors of

invading armies and mass destruction

are based on hysteria and are

absolutely false. I repeat -- these

rumors are absolutely false!

PEARSON

The ship, designed for travel outside

the earth's atmosphere, landed in

Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern

Standard Time. We still don't know

where it came from, but I can reveal

that military leaders are considering

two possibilities; that it came from

some unfriendly power here on earth --

or that it actually arrived from

another planet.

PEARSON'S VOICE

(over scene)

The ship is resting exactly where it

landed two hours ago, and there has

been no sign of life from inside it.

PEARSON'S VOICE

(over scene)

Troops have been rushed from Fort

Myer and they have formed a cordon

around the ship.

PEARSON'S VOICE

(over scene)

They are supported by machine guns,

tanks and artillery.

PEARSON'S VOICE

(over scene)

Behind police lines, there is a large

crowd of curiosity seekers.

PEARSON'S VOICE

(over scene)

As you can see for yourself, the

Army has taken every precaution to

meet whatever the situation may

require. Every eye -- every weapon --

is trained on the ship. It's been

this way for two hours and the tension--

PEARSON

Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen!

I think I see something moving!

KLAATU

We have come to visit you in peace --

and with good will.

KLAATU

Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

KLAATU

It was a gift. For your President.

(glances at the broken

object ruefully)

With this he could have studied life

on other planets.

COLONEL

(to the lieutenants)

Is he all right?

FIRST PLATOON LEADER

Got hit in the shoulder, sir.

COLONEL

Send for an ambulance. Get him to

Walter Reed Hospital right away.

CAPTAIN

Yes, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

GENERAL

(to Major)

How is he?

MAJOR WHITE

He's all right, General... Blood

pressure's a little high, but it

could be aggravation.

GENERAL

(wryly)

Can't blame him. I always get mad

when somebody shoots me.

MAJOR WHITE

He still wants to see the President.

COLONEL

(to General)

We informed the White House over an

hour ago.

GENERAL

(to Major)

Didn't drop any hints about where

he's from, did he?

MAJOR WHITE

No, sir, he didn't.

CAPTAIN

Excuse me.

(to the Colonel)

What about the reporters, Colonel?

They're swarming all over the lobby.

GENERAL

(quietly)

Tell them there won't be any statement

tonight.

CAPTAIN

Yes, sir.

(glancing down the

corridor)

Mr. Harley's here from the White

House.

HARLEY

General --

GENERAL

(indicating Klaatu's

room)

Right in there, Mr. Harley.

HARLEY

My name is Harley -- Secretary to

the President

(Klaatu continues to

study him silently)

I've been told that you speak our

language -- that your name is Mr.

Klaatu.

KLAATU

(coolly)

Just Klaatu.

HARLEY

The President asked me to convey his

deepest apologies for what has

happened. We all feel--

KLAATU

(evenly)

Sit down, Mr. Harley.

HARLEY

I'm sure I don't have to point out

that your arrival was something of a

surprise.

(getting a little

smile from Klaatu,

he is encouraged to

do some fishing)

Had you been traveling long?

KLAATU

About five months -- your months.

HARLEY

You must have come a long way.

KLAATU

About 250 million of your miles.

HARLEY

Naturally we're very curious to know

where it is you come from.

KLAATU

(easily; he's a

diplomat, too)

From another planet. Let's just say

that we're neighbors.

HARLEY

It's rather difficult for us to think

of another planet as a neighbor.

KLAATU

I'm afraid, in the present situation

you'll have to learn to think that

way.

HARLEY

(eyebrows raised)

The present situation?

KLAATU

I mean the reasons for my coming

here.

HARLEY

(his eagerness apparent)

We're very curious about that, too.

Would you care to talk about it?

KLAATU

I'd be glad to.

(noticing that Harley

is settling himself

expectantly)

Not now, of course -- with you alone.

HARLEY

Perhaps you'd rather discuss it

personally with the President--

KLAATU

(somewhat sharply)

This is not a personal matter, Mr.

Harley. It concerns all the people

on your planet.

HARLEY

(Startled by the scope

of this statement)

I -- I'm not sure I understand--

KLAATU

I want to meet with representatives

from all the nations of the Earth.

HARLEY

(shocked and perturbed

by this notion)

I'm afraid that would be a little

awkward. It's -- it's completely

without precedent. And there are

practical considerations -- the time

involved -- the enormous distances.

KLAATU

(coolly)

I traveled 250 million miles. What

about your United Nations?

HARLEY

(Surprised and a little

puzzled)

You know about the United Nations?

KLAATU

We've been monitoring your radio

broadcasts for a good many years.

That's how we learned your languages.

Lately, we've been getting your

television also.

HARLEY

(wryly)

You must have a rather strange

impression of us.

KLAATU

(smiling)

The first two years of television we

were convinced that all you did was

wrestle.

HARLEY

I'm sure you recognize from our broad-

casts the evil forces that have

produced the tension in our world.

Surely you would agree--

KLAATU

(evenly)

I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with

the internal affairs of your planet.

I consider that to be your business --

not mine.

HARLEY

I was only hoping to make you

understand.

KLAATU

(sternly, impressively)

My mission here is not to solve your

petty squabbles. It concerns the

existence of every last creature who

lives on Earth.

HARLEY

(uncomfortably)

Perhaps if you could explain a little--

KLAATU

I intend to explain. To all the

nations -- simultaneously.

(his manner precludes

opposition)

How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

HARLEY

(after a long

thoughtful moment)

We could call a special meeting of

the General Assembly... But of course

the UN doesn't represent all of the

nations.

KLAATU

Then why not a meeting of all the

Chiefs of State?

HARLEY

(helplessly, but

patiently)

Believe me, you don't understand.

They wouldn't sit down at the same

table.

KLAATU

I don't want to resort to threats,

Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly

that the future of your planet is at

stake... I suggest you transmit that

message to the nations of the Earth.

HARLEY

I will make that recommendation to

the President.

(he picks up his brief

case and hat)

I must tell you in all honesty that

I'm extremely dubious about the

results.

KLAATU

(with a half-smile)

Apparently I'm not as cynical about

Earth's people as you are.

HARLEY

I've been dealing in Earth's politics

a good deal longer than you have.

(he bows)

Goodnight, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

GENERAL

Getting any place, Sergeant?

SERGEANT

(raising his helmet)

No, sir.

(shaking his head in

annoyance)

Beats me, General. I saw that ramp

come out of the side of the ship --

right here. Now I can't even find a

crack!

GENERAL

What's the report, Carlson?

CARLSON

(discouraged)

We've tried everything from a

blowtorch to a diamond drill.

GENERAL

(nodding toward Gort)

What about him?

CARLSON

He's made out of the same stuff.

GENERAL

Has he moved?

SERGEANT

No sir. Not an inch

CARLSON

This is the toughest material I ever

saw, General. For hardness and

strength, it's out of this world.

GENERAL

(with a wry half-smile)

I can tell you officially - that's

where it came from.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAJOR

The skeletal structure is completely

normal.

(pointing)

Same for the major organs - heart,

liver, spleen, kidneys.

CAPTAIN

And the lungs are the same as ours.

Must mean a similar atmosphere --

similar pressure.

(nodding, toward

Klaatu's room)

How old do you think he is?

MAJOR

Oh, I'd say forty-five.

CAPTAIN

(smiling)

He told me this morning when I

examined him. He's seventy-eight.

MAJOR

I don't believe it.

CAPTAIN

Their life expectancy is a hundred

and thirty.

MAJOR

How does he explain that?

CAPTAIN

He says their medicine is that much

more advanced.

(the major stares at

him blankly)

He was very nice about it. But he

made me feel like a third-class witch

doctor.

MAJOR WHITE

I took a bullet out of that man's

arm yesterday.

FIRST MAJOR

What about it?

MAJOR WHITE

(utterly bewildered)

I just examined the wound and it's

all healed.

FIRST MAJOR

What does he say about it?

MAJOR WHITE

Said he put some salve on it -- some

stuff he had with him.

(shows them a small,

odd-looking tube in

his hand)

CAPTAIN

What are you going to do with it?

MAJOR WHITE

Take it downstairs and have it

analyzed.

(on his way to the

door, shaking his

head)

Then I don't know whether I'll just

get drunk or give up the practice of

medicine.

FIRST MAJOR

Afternoon, Mr. Harley.

HARLEY

Afternoon, gentlemen.

HARLEY

Good afternoon.

(surprised not to

find him in bed)

I'm glad to see you up and around.

KLAATU

Thank you... Have you any news?

HARLEY

Not very good news, I'm afraid.

(digs into his

briefcase for some

papers)

The President accepted your suggestion

and cabled the invitations for a

meeting last night.

(grimly)

Let me read you some of the replies.

(he selects a cable

and reads)

"The Premier wishes to inform the

Government of the United States that

it will be impossible for him to

attend the meeting suggested by the

President unless the meeting is held

in Moscow."

(with a grimly-pointed

glance at Klaatu,

Harley reads another

cable)

"The suggestion of the President

regarding the possibility of a meeting

in Moscow would be unacceptable to

Her Majesty's Government at the

present time. Representation could

be sent only if the meeting were

held in Washington."

(he looks up at Klaatu

and shrugs)

Well -- there you have it.

HARLEY

I tried to make you understand. The

suspicions -- the jealousies -- the

mistrust--

(uneasily, under

Klaatu's level gaze)

Surely you realize that my government

has done everything in its power--

KLAATU

It's not your government I'm thinking

about. It's your world.

HARLEY

Now that you understand the situation

more clearly, perhaps you'd like to

discuss the matter with the President

KLAATU

(sternly)

I will not speak to any one nation

or group of nations.

(sharply, bitterly)

I don't intend to add my contribution

to your childish jealousies and

suspicions.

HARLEY

Our problems are very complex, Mr.

Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too

harshly.

KLAATU

I can judge only by what I see.

HARLEY

Your impatience is quite

understandable.

KLAATU

(sharply)

I am impatient with stupidity. My

people have learned to live without

it.

HARLEY

(ruefully)

I'm afraid my people haven't.

(with real sincerity)

I'm very sorry -- I wish it were

otherwise.

KLAATU

Before making any decisions, I think

I should get out among your people --

become familiar with the basis for

these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

HARLEY

Under the circumstances I'm afraid

that will be impossible.

HARLEY

I must ask that you don't attempt to

leave the hospital. Our military

people have insisted on this. I'm

sure you'll understand.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

RADIO VOICES

(over scene)

--authorities at Walter Reed Hospital

refused to comment on how he managed

to escape, or what measures might be

taken to apprehend him.

TELEVISION COMMENTATOR

--while the President made no effort

to minimize the crisis, he urged

people all over the country to remain

calm. He said the entire facilities

of FBI and other federal agencies

are being bought to bear. He pointed

out, however, that this is no ordinary

man hunt. He warned we may be up

against powers that are beyond our

control.

MRS. CROCKETT

(tensely)

I can't stand any more of this. It's

enough to drive a person crazy.

BOBBY

Hey, Mom -- who's that?

MRS. CROCKETT

(apologizing nervously

for the tension in

the room)

I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?

KLAATU

My name is Carpenter. I'm looking

for a room.

BOBBY

Are you an FBI man?

KLAATU

No -- I'm afraid not.

BOBBY

Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking

for that space man.

HELEN

(with an apologetic

smile at Klaatu)

I think we've all been hearing too

much about "space men."

MRS. CROCKETT

(starting the

introductions with

Helen)

This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter.

(with a smile that

would split a brick)

And little Bobby.

(indicating a middle-

aged couple and a

younger but more

wizened man)

Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr.

Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.

MRS. CROCKETT

(pleased to the point

of challenge)

Well -- this is our little family.

(then, getting down

to business)

I have a very nice room on the second

floor.

BOBBY

Can I help you look for the space

man? Can I?

(excitedly)

I know what he looks like! He's got

a square head -- and, three great

big eyes!

HELEN

(good-naturedly,

calming him down)

That's enough, Bobby. I think it's

time you went to bed.

MRS. CROCKETT

(to Bobby, with a

prop smile)

We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or

he won't want to stay here. She goes

on into the hall, followed by Klaatu,

who has exchanged a polite smile

with Helen.

MRS. CROCKETT

He's really a dear little boy -- and

quiet as a mouse.

(with a shrewd, chatty

smile)

You're a long way from home, aren't

you, Mr. Carpenter?

KLAATU

How did you know?

MRS. CROCKETT

(pleased with her

cleverness)

Oh, I can tell a New England accent

a mile away.

DISSOLVE TO:

GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE

--and so, this Sunday morning, we

ask the question that's been plaguing;

the entire nation for two days now:

"Where is this creature and what is

he up to?" If he can build a space

ship that can fly to Earth -- and a

robot that can destroy our tanks and

guns -- what other terrors can he

unleash at will? ...Obviously we

must find this monster. We must track

him down like a wild animal and

destroy him.

GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE

But where would such a creature hide

himself? Would he disappear into the

north woods? Or would he slither off

into the sewers of some great city?

GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE

There is grave danger -- everyone

agrees to that. The question is what

can we do to protect ourselves? What

measures can we take that will--

MRS. BARLEY

George, I wish you'd turn that radio

off. I'm trying to concentrate.

MR. BARLEY

(snorting, he tosses

his paper down)

Why doesn't the Government do

something -- that's what I want to

know.

MR. KRULL

(mildly)

What can they do? They're only people --

Just like us.

MR. BARLEY

People my foot! They're Democrats!

MR. KRULL

It's enough to give you the shakes.

He's got that robot standing there --

ten-foot tall -- just waiting for

orders to destroy us.

HELEN

(thoughtfully)

This space man -- or whatever he is.

We automatically assume he's a

menace... Maybe he isn't at all.

MR. BARLEY

(glaring at her for

this silly notion)

Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't

he come out in the open?

MR. KRULL

Yeah.

(indicating the radio)

Like the fella says: "What's he up

to?"

HELEN

Maybe he's afraid.

MRS. BARLEY

(with a derisive snort)

He's afraid!

HELEN

After all, he was shot the moment he

landed here.

(she pauses for a

moment thoughtfully)

I was just wondering what I would

do.

KLAATU

(to Helen, helpfully)

Perhaps before deciding on a course

of action, you'd want to know more

about the people here -- to orient

yourself in a strange environment.

MRS. BARLEY

(sharply)

There's nothing strange about

Washington, Mr. Carpenter.

KLAATU

(quietly, tongue in

cheek)

A person from another planet might

disagree with you.

MRS. BARLEY

If you want my opinion, he came from

right here on Earth.

(with significant

emphasis)

And you know where I mean.

MR. KRULL

They wouldn't come in a space ship.

They'd come in airplanes.

MRS. BARLEY

(as though with

superior knowledge)

I wouldn't be so sure about that.

MR. BARLEY

(delivering the final

word)

Stands to reason that fella wants

some thing or he wouldn't be here.

(facing Klaatu)

That make sense, Carpenter?

KLAATU

I must admit I'm a little confused.

MRS. CROCKETT

Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here

to see you.

HELEN

Oh -- thank you.

MRS. BARLEY

Finish your coffee, George. I told

the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

HELEN

(smiling warmly)

Good morning.

TOM

We're all set. I picked up some

sandwiches and put gas in the car.

And the radio's still busted, so me

can forget about the space man for

today.

HELEN

(a little disturbed)

There's only one thing -- I haven't

been able to arrange for anyone to

stay with Bobby.

(tentatively)

I don't suppose we could take him

with us?

TOM

(understandably

unenthusiastically)

Well, we could--

HELEN

There's always somebody here, but

today of course they've all got plans.

KLAATU'S VOICE

I haven't any plans.

KLAATU

I'd be glad to spend the day with

him -- if you'd let me.

TOM

(impulsively)

Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it,

Helen.

HELEN

(hesitating, a little

confused, by the

offer)

It's awfully nice of you to suggest

it.

(remembering the two

men haven't met)

I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is

Tom Stevens.

KLAATU

Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday

afternoon. We talked -- and listened

to the radio.

(smiling at Helen)

I thought today he might show me

around the city.

KLAATU

(easily)

Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels

about it.

KLAATU

(visibly impressed)

Those are great words.

(with an air of

discovery)

He must have been a great man.

DISSOLVE TO:

KLAATU

That's the kind of man I'd like to

talk to.

KLAATU

Bobby -- who's the greatest man in

America today?

BOBBY

(puzzling it over)

Gee -- I don't know... The space

man, I guess.

KLAATU

(secretly amused)

I was speaking of earth men. I meant

the greatest philosopher -- the

greatest thinker.

B0BBY

You mean the smartest man in the

whole world?

KLAATU

Yes -- that would do nicely.

BOBBY

(after a moments

thought)

Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess.

He's the greatest scientist in the

world.

KLAATU

(he pauses

thoughtfully, speaks

slowly, as he recalls

the newspaper story

he read)

He lives here in Washington, doesn't

he?

BOBBY

Sure. Right near where my mother

works.

KLAATU

Where is that?

BOBBY

Department of Commerce. She's a

secretary.

(Klaatu nods)

They have a man they call the

Secretary, but he isn't at all. My

mother's a real secretary.

(after a moment;

eagerly)

Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see

the space ship?

BOBBY

Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he

could knock down a whole building.

KLAATU

(with a quizzical

smile)

I shouldn't be at all surprised.

BOBBY

(excitedly, indicating

the ship)

Gee, I'd like to get inside and see

how it works. What do you think makes

it go?

KLAATU

(quietly, after a

glance around)

Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

BOBBY

(looking at Klaatu

incredulously)

I thought that was only for bombs.

KLAATU

No. It's for a lot of other things,

too.

BOBBY

You think it can go faster than an F-

36?

KLAATU

Yes -- I think so.

BOBBY

About a thousand miles an hour?

KLAATU

Maybe four thousand miles an hour.

And outside the Earth's atmosphere a

good deal faster.

BOBBY

(excitedly)

Gee! How could they make a landing?

KLAATU

Well -- there are several ways to

reduce landing speed. You see, the

velocity--

MAN

(grinning)

Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin'

for it.

BOBBY

You think they'll ever find him?

KLAATU

(alter a moment's

pause)

I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to

doubt it.

BOBBY

(as they continue

walking)

Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity

mean?

KLAATU

(preoccupied)

Velocity is the time rate of change

of position.

BOBBY

I'll bet that's the way Professor

Barnhardt talks.

KLAATU

Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go

see Professor Barnhardt and find out

how he talks.

BOBBY

(with a half-smile of

accusation)

You're just kidding, aren't you?

KLAATU

Wouldn't you like to meet him?

BOBBY

Well, sure I would, but --

(he's to be not going

taken in)

Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

KLAATU

(with a private smile)

We can scare him more than he can

scare us.

BOBBY

I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You're a

real screwball.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOBBY

(disappointed at the

thought)

Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

BOBBY

Betcha this is where he works--

BOBBY

(indicating the

equations)

What does that mean?

KLAATU

It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

BOBBY

Bet he's the only one in the world

knows the answer.

KLAATU

(he shakes his head,

smiling)

He doesn't know the answer. And he'll

never get it that way.

BOBBY

We probably couldn't get to see him

even if he was home.

BOBBY

(in complete surprise)

Hey -- where you going?

KLAATU

If he's that difficult to see, perhaps

we ought to leave a calling card.

HILDA'S VOICE

What are you doing in here?

HILDA

(outraged by Klaatu's

desecration of the

sacred blackboard)

How dare you write on that blackboard!

(Klaatu eyes her mildly)

Do you realize the Professor has

been working on that problem for

weeks?

KLAATU

(pleasantly)

He'll catch on to it in no time now.

HILDA

(controlling herself

with an effort)

How did you get in here? And what do

you want?

KLAATU

We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

HILDA

Well, he's not here. And he won't be

back till this evening.

(sternly)

I think you'd better leave now.

Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk

and scribbles something on a scratch

pad. He tears off the piece of paper

and hands it to Hilda.

KLAATU

You might keep this.

(with easy assurance)

I think the professor will want to

get in touch with me.

KLAATU

(pointing to the

blackboard)

I wouldn't erase that. The Professor

needs it very badly.

HILDA

--no, Sergeant, there was no

classified material around, but I

have instructions to report anything

unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm

Professor Barnhardt's secretary.

(consulting the paper

in her hand)

The man's name is Carpenter -- and

he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W...

Yes, that's right--

DISSOLVE TO:

BOBBY

That's my father.

(Klaatu glances at

the boy, then nods

understandingly)

He was killed at a place called Anzio.

DISSOLVE TO:

KLAATU

(Reflectively)

Did all these people die in wars?

BOBBY

(somewhat surprised)

Sure. Didn't you ever hear of

Arlington Cemetery?

KLAATU

No -- I'm afraid not.

BOBBY

(very serious)

Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to

know about anything.

KLAATU

(Amused)

I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been

away for a long time. Very far away.

BOBBY

Is it different where you've been?

(indicating the

cemetery)

Don't they have places like this?

KLAATU

(slowly)

They have cemeteries. But not like

this one... You see, they don't have

any wars.

BOBBY

Gee -- that's a good idea.

KLAATU

What would you like to do this

afternoon?

BOBBY

Go to the movies.

KLAATU

All right.

BOBBY

(he didn't dare hope

for this)

No foolin'? Will you?

KLAATU

Certainly.

(then he hesitates)

Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to

have money to go there?

BOBBY

(eagerly)

I've got some money. My mother gave

me two dollars.

KLAATU

No -- I want to take you to the

movies.

(he takes some objects

out of his pocket)

Do you think they'd accept these?

BOBBY

Gee -- those look like diamonds!

KLAATU

Some places that's what people use

for money. They're easy to carry --

and they don't wear out.

BOBBY

(staring at them

fascinated)

Bet they're worth about a million

dollars.

KLAATU

Would you give me your two dollars

for a couple of them?

BOBBY

(with a nervous, unsure

smile)

Well, sure, but--

BOBBY

(slowly)

Okay.

BOBBY

Let's not say anything to my mother

about this, Mr. Carpenter.

KLAATU

(mildly curious)

Why not, Bobby?

BOBBY

(gravely)

She doesn't like me to steal from

people.

DISSOLVE TO:

DETECTIVE

Mr. Carpenter come home yet?

BOBBY

(studying the man

curiously)

Yeah -- he's right inside.

DETECTIVE

Tell him I'd like to see him.

BOBBY

(calling out)

Mr. Carpenter--!

(to the Detective)

Come on in.

DETECTIVE

Your name Carpenter?

KLAATU

(puzzled that anyone

should know him)

Yes.

(then recalling, with

a smile of

satisfaction)

Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's

looking far me.

DETECTIVE

(dryly, with grim

emphasis)

I been looking for you all afternoon.

HELEN

(fondly)

It was a wonderful day.

TOM

You still haven't answered my

question.

HELEN

(warmly sincere)

You know how I feel, Tom. I just

want to think it over.

TOM

The boss is leaving for Chicago

tomorrow. If I could tell him I was

getting married -- with two dependents--

HELEN

(smiling)

You're a good salesman -- but I've

got to think about it.

TOM

A good insurance salesman wouldn't

give you time to think.

HELEN

'Night.

BOBBY

Hi Mom!

HELEN

Hello, darling.

(she kisses Bobby,

then turns

questioningly to

Klaatu and the

Detective)

Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.

KLAATU

Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

BOBBY

(Impressively)

Mr. Brady's a cop.

HELEN

(to Bobby)

Did you have a nice day, dear?

BOBBY

(enthusiastically)

Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we,

Mr. Carpenter?

KLAATU

We certainly did.

BOBBY

We went to the movies -- and we had

ice cream cones -- and we went to

see Daddy--

HELEN

(moved and grateful,

she's uneasy and

concerned as she

turns to Klaatu)

I don't know how to thank you.

KLAATU

I enjoyed every minute of it.

DETECTIVE

(with quiet insistence)

We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.

BOBBY

Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.

KLAATU

We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight,

Bobby.

BOBBY

(reluctantly)

Goodnight.

HELEN

Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

BOBBY

(he followers her,

then hesitates)

Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have

to go down to the police station?

HELEN

I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps

there's some mistake.

BOBBY

We sure had fun today. We saw the

space ship and we went to see

Professor Barnhardt -- and--

HELEN

(flashing him a

puzzled, incredulous

look)

Professor Barnhardt.

BOBBY

(almost ignoring the

interruption)

Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to

school tomorrow?

HELEN

Of course, dear.

BOBBY

Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play

with Mr. Carpenter.

DISSOLVE TO:

FIRST COP

(to the cop beside

him)

B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.

SECOND COP

(to the vagrant)

No identification?

(the man shakes his

head dully)

Send him over to G-2.

BUSINESSMAN

My wife just arrived with my

identification.

THIRD COP

That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to

bother you... Next.

FOURTH COP

Cappo, John C?

(the man nods)

Two priors -- one for petty theft --

one for shoplifting.

FIFTH COP

(waving the man away)

Okay, Jonny -- you can go.

MAN

(with a nervous grin)

Sometimes a record comes in handy.

(and he moves off)

LIEUTENANT

The Professor's secretary says she

found you in Barnhardt's room, making

marks on his blackboard.

KLAATU

I was only trying to be helpful. He

was having difficulty with a problem.

LIEUTENANT

(sardonically)

Oh, I see. He was having trouble and

you were helping him out.

KLAATU

(pleasantly)

That's right.

LIEUTENANT

(quietly sharp and

accusing)

I suppose you know that Barnhardt

does a lot of secret work for the

Army.

KLAATU

In this case the secret wouldn't be

worth much. He doesn't know the answer

himself.

LIEUTENANT

(growing impatient)

But I suppose you know the answer.

KLAATU

(with a deprecating

shrug)

It's really quite simple... The three-

body problem, you know.

LIEUTENANT

Your name's Carpenter -- that right?

(Klaatu nods)

Any identification, Mr. Carpenter?

Driver's license -- social security

number?

KLAATU

No -- I'm afraid not.

LIEUTENANT

Well, how do I know who you are?

KLAATU

(secretly amused)

You don't.

COP

Excuse me, Lieutenant --

(pointing offscene)

The Doc says this man needs treatment

right away.

LIEUTENANT

What's the story?

COP

Some fella caught him lookin' in a

window and figured he was the space

man. The whole neighborhood went

crazy and they ganged up on him.

Would have killed him if we hadn't

come along... Turns out he was just

a prowler.

LIEUTENANT

Okay -- book him and get him fixed

up.

(the cops nods and

goes, and the

Lieutenant growls as

he turns back to

Klaatu and the

Detective)

Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

KLAATU

(appalled by what he

has seen and heard)

They would have killed this man?

LIEUTENANT

(gruffly)

People get hysterical enough, they

do anything.

(impatiently)

Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't

identify yourself, I got to send you

over to the Army.

KLAATU

(pretending impatience,

but actually growing

concerned)

How long will that take?

LIEUTENANT

They can tell right away. They've

got a couple of doctors who saw this

man in the hospital.

(to the Detective)

Take him over to G2.

KLAATU

It's very important, Lieutenant,

that I see Professor Barnhardt.

DETECTIVE

Come on, Mr. Carpenter--

KLAATU

May I suggest that you call the

Professor?

LIEUTENANT

(all patience gone)

Get going, will you, Brady -- before

I get mad!

LIEUTENANT

(to the Detective)

Wait a minute, Brady--

(indicating orders in

his hand)

The Captain here's got orders from

General Cutler to take this man over

to Professor Barnhardt.

M.P. CAPTAIN

(to Klaatu firmly but

respectfully)

Will you come with me, Sir?

KLAATU

Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.

DISSOLVE TO:

M.P. CAPTAIN

This is the man you wanted to see,

Professor.

BARNHARDT

(studying Klaatu

curiously)

Thank you, Captain.

M.P. CAPTAIN

I'll wait outside.

BARNHARDT

You wrote this?

KLAATU

(nodding easily)

It was a clumsy way to introduce

myself -- but I understand you're a

difficult man to see.

(glancing at the

blackboard

reproachfully)

I thought you'd have the solution by

this time.

BARNHARDT

Not yet. That's why I wanted to see

you.

KLAATU

All you have to do now is substitute

this expression--

(pointing to a specific

place)

--at this point.

BARNHARDT

(slowly, thoughtfully)

Yes -- that will reproduce the first-

order terms. But what about the effect

of the other terms?

KLAATU

Almost negligible... With variation

of parameters, this is the answer.

BARNHARDT

How can you be so sure? Have you

tested this theory?

KLAATU

(with a slight smile)

I find it works well enough to get

me from one planet to another.

(Barnhardt stares at

him blankly)

I understand you've called a meeting

to study our space ship.

BARNHARDT

As though unsure of what he's heard)

Yes -- yes, I have.

KLAATU

My name is Klaatu.

(noting that

Barnhardt's expression

is changing from

amazement to

incredulity)

I spent two days at your Walter Reed

Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name

was Major White -- and I had a very

attractive nurse called Ruth, who's

getting married next Wednesday.

(Klaatu waits for

this to sink in,

then speaks with

quiet authority)

If you are not interested -- or if

you intend to turn me over to your

Army -- we needn't waste any more

time.

BARNHARDT

(to the Captain, his

voice a little

unsteady)

You can go now, Captain. Please thank

General Cutler and tell him -- tell

him that I know this gentleman.

KLAATU

(dryly)

You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

BARNHARDT

It isn't faith that makes good

science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.

(unable to conceal

his interest)

Sit down, please. I have several

thousand questions to ask you.

KLAATU

(ignoring the

invitation)

I would like to explain something of

my mission here.

BARNHARDT

That was my first question.

KLAATU

(with some bitterness)

It was my intention to discuss this

officially -- with all the nations

of the Earth -- but I was not allowed

the Opportunity. I have come to

realize since that your mutual fears

and suspicions are merely the normal

reactions of a primitive society.

(gathering his thoughts)

We know from scientific observation

that you have discovered a rudimentary

kind of atomic energy. We also know

that you are experimenting with

rockets.

BARNHARDT

Yes -- that is true.

KLAATU

In the hands of a mature civilization,

these would not be considered weapons

of aggression. But in the hands of

your people--

(he shrugs and shakes

his head)

We've observed your aggressive

tendencies, and we don't trust you

with such power.

BARNHARDT

(puzzled)

If you mean that you are afraid of

us--

KLAATU

(with cool impressive

emphasis)

We want to be sure you don't make --

let us say -- an unfortunate mistake.

We know the potentiality of these

developments and we are disturbed to

find them in the hands of children...

You see, we've had atomic energy for

five thousand of your years.

(indicating the

telephone)

We discarded instruments like this

many centuries ago.

(he paces thoughtfully)

So long as you were limited to

fighting among yourselves -- with

your primitive tanks and planes --

we were unconcerned. But soon you

will apply atomic energy to space

ships -- and then you become a threat

to the peace and security of other

planets. That, of course, we cannot

tolerate.

BARNHARDT

(thoughtful and

impressed)

These other planets -- do they have

peace and security?

KLAATU

We had our atomic wars -- thousands

of years ago.

(he smiles wryly)

After that we fought with bows and

arrows. Then, slowly, we learned

that fighting is no solution -- that

aggression leads to chaos.

BARNHARDT

(with deep conviction)

We scientists understand this. Even

we primitive scientists.

(Straightforwardly)

What exactly is the nature of your

mission, Mr. Klaatu?

KLAATU

I came here to warn you that, by

threatening danger, your planet faces

danger -- very grave danger. I am

prepared, however, to offer a

solution.

BARNHARDT

Would you care to be more specific?

KLAATU

(evenly)

What I have to say must be said to

all concerned.

(with a suggestion of

deference to Barnhardt)

It is too important to be entrusted

to any individual.

BARNHARDT

I gather that your efforts on the

official level were not entirely

successful.

KLAATU

(sternly, as this

unpleasant episode

is recalled)

I come to you as a last resort --

and I confess that my patience is

wearing thin.

(with Jovian annoyance)

Must I take drastic action in order

to get a hearing?

BARNHARDT

(uneasily)

What -- what sort of action do you

mean?

KLAATU

Violent action -- since that seems

to be the only thing you people

understand.

(quietly)

Leveling the island of Manhattan,

perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of

Gibraltar into the sea.

BARNHARDT

Would you be willing to meet with

the group of scientists I am calling

together?. Perhaps you could explain

your mission to them, and they in

turn could present it to their various

peoples.

KLAATU

(quietly, evenly)

That's what I came to see you about.

BARNHARDT

It is not enough to have men of

science. We scientists are too easily

ignored -- or misunderstood. We must

get important men from every field.

Educators -- philosophers -- church

leaders -- men of vision and

imagination -- the finest minds in

the world.

KLAATU

I leave that in your hands.

BARNHARDT

You'd have no objection to revealing

yourself at this meeting?

KLAATU

No -- not at all.

BARNHARDT

What about your personal safety in

the meantime? What about the Army --

and the police?

KLAATU

My name is Carpenter and I'm a very

earthy character living in a

respectable boarding house.

BARNHARDT

(smiling, but a little

concerned)

I'm afraid I can't offer you any

real protection. I have no influence

in cases of inter-planetary

conspiracy.

KLAATU

I'm sure I'll be quite safe until

the meeting.

BARNHARDT

(he suddenly pauses,

thoughtfully)

One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this

group should reject your proposals.

What is the alternative?

KLAATU

(with a sense of quiet,

inescapable power)

I'm afraid you have no alternative.

In such, a case the planet Earth

would have to be--

(he looks for the

right word)

--eliminated.

BARNHARDT

Such power exists?

KLAATU

I assure you such power exists.

BARNHARDT

The people who came to the meeting

must be made to realize this. They

must understand what is at stake.

(after a thoughtful

moment, he looks up)

You mentioned a demonstration of

force--

KLAATU

Yes.

BARNHARDT

Would such, a demonstration be

possible before the meeting?

KLAATU

Yes -- of course.

BARNHARDT

Something that would dramatize for

them and for their people the

seriousness of the situation.

Something that would affect the entire

planet.

KLAATU

(with a nod)

That can easily be arranged.

BARNHARDT

(frightened by his

easy assumption of

infinite power)

I wouldn't want you to harm anybody --

or destroy anything.

KLAATU

(easily)

Why don't you leave it to me? I'll

think of something.

BARNHARDT

(with a nervous half-

smile)

Maybe a little demonstration.

KLAATU

(thinking about it)

Something dramatic -- but not

destructive.

(intellectually amused)

It's quite an interesting problem.

(Barnhardt nods vaguely)

Would day after tomorrow be all right?

Say about noon?

FADE OUT:

MRS. CROCKETT

Going out, dear?

HELEN

Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me

up.

MRS. CROCKETT

(with a shudder)

Personally, I won't go out after

dark these days.

(with an attempt at

slyness)

But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

MRS. CROCKETT

(thoroughly startled)

Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

KLAATU

Everyone seems so--

(he shakes his hands

to indicate

nervousness)

HELEN

Jittery is the word.

KLAATU

(with a contemplative

smile)

Bobby's the only person I know who

isn't -- Jittery.

HELEN

He has his homework to keep him

occupied.

KLAATU

(fondly, sincerely)

He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.

HELEN

Naturally I think so.

KLAATU

Warm and friendly and intelligent--

(thoughtfully)

You know -- he's the only real friend

I've made since I've been here.

HELEN

(hesitantly and with

some difficulty)

Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my

business, but -- why did that

detective come here last night?

KLAATU

(with easy frankness)

Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a

few questions. Bobby and I tried to

see Professor Barnhardt in the

afternoon, but he wasn't in.

Apparently they thought I was looking

for secrets of some kind.

HELEN

Hello--

TOM

You ready?

HELEN

I will be in just a minute.

TOM

(a little annoyed

that she hasn't her

coat on, he consults

his watch)

The picture starts at eight-fifty.

HELEN

(in explanation)

I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

TOM

(lightly, but with

real sarcasm

underneath)

I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm

intruding.

KLAATU

Excuse me. I was just going up to my

room.

HELEN

(guiltily)

Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

KLAATU

Have a good time -- both of you.

HELEN

Why don't you wait in here while I

get my things?

HELEN

(quietly)

Oh, Tom, that was awful.

TOM

(momentary apologetic)

I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of

hearing about Mr. Carpenter.

(Helen shushes him)

I don't like the way he's attached

himself to you and Bobby. After all,

what do you know about him?

HELEN

I'll go get my things.

KLAATU

(about to leave)

All you have to remember is, first

find the common denominator -- then

subtract.

BOBBY

Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

KLAATU

(to Helen, pleasantly)

I'll say goodnight again.

HELEN

Mr. Carpenter, I--

(it's too complicated;

she can't do it)

Goodnight.

KLAATU

(with a warm smile of

complete understanding

and appreciation)

Goodnight, my dear.

HELEN

Go to bed, darling. You can finish

that in the morning.

BOBBY

Okay.

HELEN

(hesitantly, almost

guiltily)

Bobby -- I think it would be better

if we didn't see quite so much of

Mr. Carpenter

BOBBY

(shocked, and

bewildered)

Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend...

And he's awful good in arithmetic.

He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

HELEN

Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go

to see Professor Barnhardt?

BOBBY

Sure we did! He wasn't there but we

went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter

showed him how to do his arithmetic.

BOBBY

(shrewdly)

Mom -- is there something wrong with

Mr. Carpenter?

HELEN

What do you mean, dear?

BOBBY

I mean -- on account of that policeman

last night.

(his eyes light up

hopefully)

You think he's a bank robber, maybe?

Or a gangster?

HELEN

No, dear, of course not. He's a very

nice man. I Just think he might prefer

to be left alone. Now you get to bed

and forget about it.

(she kisses him)

'Night, darling.

BOBBY

Goodnight.

(stopping her in the

doorway, his

imaginative suspicions

mounting)

Hey Mom -- why would he want to be

alone?

KLAATU

Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

BOBBY

(surprised by his

appearance and his

request)

Yeah -- sure.

(he goes to a drawer

and gets a large

hand flashlight)

It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

BOBBY

What do you want it for, Mr.

Carpenter?

KLAATU

(evasively)

Why -- the light in my room went

out.

(cutting off further

questions)

Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

HELEN'S VOICE

(off scene)

Why don't you come on in for a minute?

HELEN

Bobby--! What are you doing up at

this hour?

BOBBY

(excitedly)

I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had

to tell you!

HELEN

Tell me what?

BOBBY

(the words tadpole

out breathlessly)

I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right

after you left -- and, gee, Mom,

where do you think he went? Right

into the space ship!

HELEN

(patiently disbelieving)

Now, Bobby, just a minute--

BOBBY

Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened

up and he walked right in. And that

great big iron man was moving around!

HELEN

Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

BOBBY

(desperately)

No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you...

I saw it!

TOM

Where did you see all this, Bobby?

BOBBY

On the lawn down at the mall -- in

that place with the soldiers out

front.

TOM

(trying to trap him)

Where were the soldiers all this

time?

BOBBY

That robot fella grabbed 'em and

dragged 'em inside!

(his lips trembling)

I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm

scared, Mom.

HELEN

(holding him close to

her sympathetically)

Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It

was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll

prove it to you.

(with a look and a

nod to Tom)

Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if

he'll come down for a minute.

(Tom turns to go)

The room right opposite mine.

HELEN

Now think back hard. You didn't follow

Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You

haven't even been out of the house.

BOBBY

Yes, I have!

HELEN

(determinedly)

You didn't really see the space ship.

You just thought you did.

BOBBY

I'd never call you a liar.

TOM

He's not there.

(crossing to Helen)

But look what I found in his room

HELEN

(takes the stone and

studies it, amazed

by its size)

Is it real?

TOM

(with the shrug of an

amateur)

Looks real to me.

BOBBY

Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds.

(he digs into his

pocket)

He gave me a couple of them.

HELEN

He gave these to you?

BOBBY

(guilty for his own

sharp dealing)

Well, not exactly. I gave him two

dollars.

TOM

This doesn't make sense... I think

the guy's a crook. I never did trust

him.

BOBBY

Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a

diamond smuggler?

HELEN

(firmly)

Come on, darling -- we're going up

to bed.

TOM

I wonder if we ought to--

HELEN

(cutting him off with

a look)

Bobby and I have had enough excitement

for tonight.

TOM

(seriously concerned)

You think it's all right for you to

stay here?

HELEN

(nods reassuringly)

I've got a good lock on my door.

(smiling at Bobby)

And Bobby's going to sleep in my

room tonight.

BOBBY

Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

HELEN

Yes, dear. Come on now.

(she happens to look

down at his feet.

Puzzled, and

concerned, she feels

his shoes)

Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

BOBBY

(reluctantly, with

childish guilt)

Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.

FADE OUT:

HELEN

(unnerved)

Oh -- hello--

KLAATU

May I see you for a minute?

HELEN

I -- I was Just going to lunch.

KLAATU

(quietly insistent)

May I walk out with you?

HELEN

(into phone)

Mrs. Benson speaking.

(recognizing the voice,

she glances nervously

at Klaatu)

Oh, hello...

TOM

(into phone, cheerily)

I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal

on that diamond. I thought we might

have lunch together.

HELEN

(with a nervous glance

at Klaatu)

I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right

now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes,

that'll be fine. 'Bye.

KLAATU

(watching Helen's

reaction)

I saw Bobby this morning before he

went to school--

HELEN

(glancing at him

apprehensively)

Yes--?

KLAATU

I want to know what he told you last

night.

HELEN

(nervous and evasive)

I -- I didn't really pay much

attention--

(with a nervous little

laugh)

Bobby has such an active imagination.

KLAATU

(refusing to be put

off)

Did you believe what he told you?

(Helen hesitates,

trapped by uncertainty)

I have a reason for asking this -- a

very important reason.

HELEN

There's another elevator we can use--

HELEN

(her nerves raw and

edgy)

What is it you want?

KLAATU

Before I ask you to be honest with

me, perhaps I should be completely

honest with you--

HELEN

(gasping with fright)

What happened?

KLAATU

(a moment's hesitation;

then he remembers)

What time is it?

HELEN

Just twelve.

KLAATU

We'll be stuck here for a little

while -- about thirty minutes.

HELEN

(preoccupied with her

own thinking)

We could try pushing the other

buttons.

(digging in her purse)

I have a flashlight in my purse.

KLAATU

It won't work.

HELEN

Why not?

KLAATU

(after a moment,

quietly)

You see -- the electricity's been

neutralized -- all over the world.

HELEN

Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't

he?

DISSOLVE TO:

CAB DRIVER

My ol' lady was right. We shoulda

got a place in the country.

COCKNEY

It's that space man -- that's wot it

DISSOLVE TO:

HILDA

You should see it, Professor

Barnhardt! You should go out and see

it for yourself!

BARNHARDT

Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

HILDA

The whole city has stopped. People

are running around like ants!

BARNHARDT

(musing admiringly on

Klaatu's cleverness)

What a brilliant idea. I never would

have thought of it.

BARNHARDT

What about the people who are coming

to the meeting tonight? Have they

all arrived?

HILDA

(nodding)

I talked to most of them this

morning... They were all very curious

about the meeting.

BARNHARDT

Good. Did you speak to our friend

Mr. Carpenter?

HILDA

(nodding)

He'll be there at 8:30.

BARNHARDT

(studying her for a

moment)

Tell me, Hilda -- does all this

frighten you -- does it make you

feel insecure?

HILDA

Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

BARNHARDT

(nodding with a bland

little smile)

That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

DISSOLVE TO:

GENERAL

--as far as we can tell, all power's

been cut off everywhere -- with a

telephone, radio, cable -- everything.

(gravely)

I can tell you that the President is

prepared to declare a state of

national emergency.

(pausing to let this

sink in)

Before we start discussing plans, I

want a report from Colonel Ryder.

What about the robot, Colonel?

COLONEL RYDER

When it was discovered last night

that the robot had moved, I was

directed by the Joint Chiefs to find

a means of immobilizing him. We

accomplished that this morning by

encasing him in a block of KL 93.

(he hands a small

block of plastic to

the General)

It's a new plastic material --

stronger than steel.

GENERAL

Is it possible that he's broken out

of this stuff?

COLONEL

No, sir. I've Just checked on that.

He's locked up tight as a drum.

GENERAL

All right -- that means we concentrate

on the man.

(to the group with

force and authority)

Up till now we've agreed on the

desirability of capturing this man

alive. We can no longer afford to be

so particular. We'll get him alive,

if possible -- but we must get him!

(eyes the group sternly)

Is that clear?

DISSOLVE TO:

JEWELER

Eleanor, did you call the electrician?

GIRL

(she's not too bright)

I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone

doesn't work, either.

JEWELER

(absently, as he

studies the stone)

Well, call the phone company.

GIRL

(plaintively)

But the phone doesn't work.

TOM

Is it worth anything?

JEWELER

I have never seen such a stone. Will

you please tell me where it came

from?

TOM

That's what I wanted you to tell me.

JEWELER

(overwhelmed and

absorbed by the stone,

he shakes his head,

bewildered)

There are no diamonds like this --

any place in the world.

TOM

You sure about that?

JEWELER

(eagerly, shrewdly)

Would you like to sell it?

TOM

(picking up the stone)

No -- no, thanks.

JEWELER

I'd give you a very good price.

DISSOLVE TO:

KLAATU

(speaking gravely)

--I've already told you more than I

told Professor Barnhardt, because my

life, in a sense, is in your hands.

I thought if you knew the facts you'd

appreciate the importance of my not

being -- apprehended, -- before the

meeting tonight.

HELEN

Yes, of course. Of course I do.

HELEN

(studying his face

anxiously)

You hold great hope for this meeting.

KLAATU

I can see no other hope for your

planet. If the meeting should fail,

then I'm afraid there is no hope.

KLAATU

(calmly)

It must be twelve-thirty.

HELEN

(looks at her watch,

then back at him,

awe-struck)

Yes -- Just exactly.

HELEN

Where are you going now?

KLAATU

Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be

safe there for the afternoon -- and

I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the

only other person who knows anything

about--

HELEN

No, wait a minute -- there's someone

else.

KLAATU

Who?

HELEN

Tom... He was there last night when

Bobby told me what he saw.

HELEN

(worriedly)

Of course, he doesn't know anything

definite. He'd talk to me first,

anyway, before--

(interrupting herself

in sudden decision)

We can't take that chance. I'll get

in touch with him right away and

make sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

(into phone)

--But I've got to talk to him. It's

terribly important. When is he coming

back?

SECRETARY

I don't know, Mrs. Benson. He left

before noon -- before that awful

electric business. I'm scared to

death, Mrs. Benson. I -- No, he

wouldn't tell me where he was gong.

Said it was something personal.

HELEN

Tell him I want to see him the minute

he gets in... No, I'll call back.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE

Attention, please.... All flights

from National Airport have been

canceled until further notice.. All

flights from this airport have been

canceled.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SECRETARY

(into phone, nervous

and jittery)

--Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't

sit still. I'd like to run some place,

but I don't know where to go--

(hearing the door

open, she cuts off)

'Bye now.

TOM

Call the Pentagon and find out who's

in charge of this space man business.

Whoever it is I want to talk to him.

SECRETARY

Mrs. Benson's been trying to get you

all afternoon. She says it's

important.

TOM

Get this other call first.

SECRETARY

Oh, Mrs. Benson -- He just walked

in.

(misery loves company)

Are you nervous, too?

HELEN

Yes, I am, Margaret.

SECRETARY

Mrs. Benson is here.

(turning to Helen)

Go on in.

HELEN

Tom -- I've been trying to get you

all afternoon--

TOM

(preoccupied with his

own excitement)

Come on in.

TOM

I've got some terrific news about

your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

HELEN

(trying to appear

calm)

What about him?

TOM

Helen, he's the man from the space

ship!

(she eyes him evenly,

apprehensively, as

he hurries on)

I had that diamond checked at three

different places. Nobody on earth's

ever seen a stone like that! After

what Bobby told us, that's enough

for me. Why is it nobody knows

anything about him? Why hasn't he

got any money?

HELEN

(evenly, with quiet

tension)

All right, Tom -- it's true. I know

it's true.

TOM

How do you know?

HELEN

Never mind about that.

(urgently, with great

concern)

You've got to promise me you won't

say a word to anybody.

TOM

Are you crazy? After what happened

today?

HELEN

You don't understand. You don't

realize how important it is.

TOM

(impatiently)

Important? Of course it's important.

The point is we can do something

about it.

HELEN

That's what I'm trying to tell you.

We mustn't do anything about it.

Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm

talking about.

TOM

(irritated by her

opposition)

He's a menace to the whole world!

It's our duty to turn him in.

HELEN

(desperately)

But he isn't a menace! He told me

what he came here for.

TOM

(dismissing this with

annoyed contempt)

He told you... Don't be silly, honey --

just because you like the guy.

(busy with his own

thoughts)

You realize what this'd mean for us?

I'd be the biggest man in the country.

I could write my own ticket.

HELEN

(eyeing him coldly)

Is that what you're thinking about?

TOM

(guiltily, defensive)

Why not? Somebody's got to get rid

of him.

HELEN

I'm not going to let you do it, Tom.

(with deep personal

urgency)

Believe me, this is literally the

most important thing in the world.

TOM

(into phone)

Yes?... What's his name, Margaret?

General Cutler?

(disappointed that

the connection isn't

completed)

All right, I'll hold on.

HELEN

Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know

what you're doing! It isn't just you

and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the

world, is involved!

TOM

(exasperated)

I don't care about the rest of the

world!

TOM

You'll feel different when you see

my picture in the papers.

HELEN

(staring at him starkly)

I feel different right now.

TOM

(uneasily)

You wait and see. You're going to

marry a big hero!

HELEN

I'm not going to marry anybody.

TOM

(into phone)

Hello, General Cutler?

(irritated)

No, I don't want to speak to his

aide. I want to speak to the General.

Tell him it's about the space man...

My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n-

s.

DISSOLVE TO:

TOM

(into phone)

That's right, General. That's where

he's staying... Yes, of course I'm

sure.

GENERAL CUTLER

(after listening for

a moment)

Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens.

I'll want to talk to you further but

I haven't time now.

(hangs up and turns

to Colonel)

Deploy all Zone 5 units according to

Plan B -- immediately.

DISSOLVE TO:

COLONEL

(into radio)

Attention, Zone 5... Yellow cab,

moving north on B from Ninth Street.

Man and woman in back seat. Get the

license number and report.

KLAATU

I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to

hide me until the meeting.

HELEN

Where is the meeting going to be?

KLAATU

At the ship.

COLONEL

(into radio)

Attention, Zone 5... license number

of target vehicle is W 4936... All

vehicles maintain your positions --

and hold your fire.

COLONEL

(into radio)

Attention, Zone 5 -- report when

target vehicle passes your position.

HELEN

(trying to give him

encouragement)

It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

KLAATU

I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid

of what he might do -- if anything

should happen to me.

HELEN

Gort?

(puzzled)

But he's a robot. I mean -- without

you, what could he do?

KLAATU

(slowly)

There's no limit to what he could

do. He could destroy the Earth.

(with great urgency)

If anything should happen to me, you

must go to Gort. You must give him

this message: "Klaatu barada nikto."

Please repeat that.

HELEN

(shocked and

bewildered, she

repeats nervously)

"Klaatu barada nikto."

KLAATU

(gravely)

Remember those words.

COLONEL

(into radio)

Attention, Zone 5... Section number

2 -- block off Tenth Street at

Massachusetts. All vehicles close

in.

DRIVER

Hey, what's this all about?

KLAATU

(weakly, insistently)

Get that message to Gort. Right away--

DISSOLVE TO:

HELEN

Gort--!

(with desperate clarity)

Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

DISSOLVE TO:

COLONEL

(into phone)

Yes, sir, we've got the body here

now. Downstairs in a cell... No

question about it, General -- he's

dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I

understand.

COLONEL

General Cutler's coming down here

right away.

(to the Lieutenant)

Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and

post a guard around that cell.

(to Captain)

Captain, don't let anyone in or out

of the building.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

KLAATU

(with a grateful glance

at Gort, he turns to

Helen)

Hello.

HELEN

(staring at him)

I -- I thought you were--

KLAATU

(nodding, with a smile)

I was.

HELEN

(looking at Gort in

awe)

You mean he has the power of life

and death?

KLAATU

No -- that is a power reserved to

the Almighty Spirit.

KLAATU

(indicating the

equipment Gort used)

This technique, in certain cases,

can re-stimulate life for a limited

period. It's a refinement of

scientific principles known to your

own people.

HELEN

(concerned for him)

But how -- how long--?

KLAATU

How long will I live?

(he shrugs)

That no one can say.

COLONEL

I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I

have to ask you to call off this

meeting.

BARNHARDT

Call it off? I... But I had permission

from the Army--

COLONEL

I know you did. But the robots on

the loose now and it isn't safe around

here. You'll have to get your friends

out of that building.

KLAATU

Gort and I will be leaving soon.

HELEN

(simply, sincerely)

We'll miss you very much -- Bobby

and I.

(smiling to conceal

her real feelings)

He won't have anyone to play with.

KLAATU

He'll have you -- and Tom.

HELEN

(quietly -- definitely)

No. That's all finished.

KLAATU

I'm sorry.

HELEN

(she is sensible and

objective, but not

unfeeling)

I think I'm very lucky. You don't

always get a chance to recognize a

mistake before you make it.

BARNHARDT

Ladies and Gentlemen--

BARNHARDT

I called you from your work and from

your homes all over the world because

we were to meet here tonight with a

man from another planet -- the man

who came here in this ship.

(there are audible

exclamations of

surprise and

disappointment)

As you all know, this is no longer

possible. I can only say that I share

the bitterness of your disappointment.

KLAATU

Gort -- berengo.

BARNHARDT

--under the circumstances, the Army

people have asked us to leave the

building. And, since their concern

is for our safety, I can do nothing

but suggest that we comply--

KLAATU

(straightforwardly,

with almost stern

authority)

I am leaving soon and you will forgive

me if I speak bluntly.

(he pauses, studying

the faces)

The Universe grows smaller every day --

and the threat of aggression by any

group -- anywhere -- can no longer

be tolerated.

KLAATU'S VOICE

(over scene)

There must be security for all -- or

no one is secure... This does not

mean giving up any freedom except

the freedom to act irresponsibly.

KLAATU'S VOICE

(over scene)

Your ancestors knew this when they

made laws to govern themselves --

and hired policemen to enforce them.

KLAATU

We of the other planets have long

accepted this principle. We have an

organization for the mutual protection

of all planets -- and for the complete

elimination of aggression. A sort of

United Nations on the Planetary

level... The test of any such higher

authority, of course, is the police

force that supports it. For our

policemen, we created a race of robots--

(indicating Gort)

Their function is to patrol the

planets -- in space ships like this

one -- and preserve the peace. In

matters of aggression we have given

them absolute power over us.

KLAATU'S VOICE

(over scene)

At the first sign of violence they

act automatically against the

aggressor. And the penalty for

provoking their action is too terrible

to risk.

KLAATU

The result is that we live in peace,

without arms or armies, secure in

the knowledge that we are free from

aggression and war -- free to pursue

more profitable enterprises.

(after a pause)

We do not pretend to have achieved

perfection -- but we do have a system --

and it works.

(with straightforward

candor)

I came here to give you the facts.

It is no concern of ours how you run

your own planet -- but if you threaten

to extend your violence, this Earth

of yours will be reduced to a burned-

out cinder.

KLAATU

Your choice is simple. Join us and

live in peace. Or pursue your present

course -- and face obliteration.

(after a pause)

We will be waiting for your answer.

decision rests with you.

KLAATU

Gort -- veracto.

FADE OUT:

THE END
