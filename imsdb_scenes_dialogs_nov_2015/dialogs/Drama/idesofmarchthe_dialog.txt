THE IDES OF MARCH

Written by

George Clooney, Grant Heslov & Beau Willimon

STEPHEN

I am neither Christian...nor

atheist. I am not Jewish or

Muslim. What I believe...my

religion is called the

constitution...

DIRECTOR

Hang on...let me open these up....

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Okay...

STEPHEN

I will defend till my dying breath

your right to worship whatever god

you believe in...

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

If I'm not religious enough for

you, don't vote for me.

(CONTINUED)

2.

CONTINUED:

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

You got it?

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

If I'm not experienced enough don't

vote for me. If I'm not...

DIRECTOR

Okay got it, thanks.

STEPHEN

Thanks. We'll need these monitors

turned up a bit...it's a big space

and he wants to be able to hear.

STAGE MANAGER

You got it.

STEPHEN

Also we'll need these podiums put

on a riser as we agreed to in the

pre-conditions. You're a few

inches short and it makes it harder

for the Governor to read his notes.

STAGE MANAGER

No I know, we just got those specs

last night and they're building a

piece to go under...

STEPHEN

Great, thanks. See you guys in a

few hours.

BEN

I didn't know the Governor had

trouble reading his notes. Why

doesn't he wear...

STEPHEN

He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8"

he'll look like a hobbit behind

that podium.

CUT TO:

RACHEL MADDOW (O.C.)

Well it all comes down to this...We

are one week away from the Ohio

primary...

CUT TO:

RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)

Two democrats are left standing.

Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is

trailing Governor Morris from

Pennsylvania.

(CONTINUED)

4.

CONTINUED:

RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)

Governor Morris has mounted a

sizable lead with 2047 delegates,

winning New Hampshire, California,

New York and Michigan...But Senator

Pullman with 1302 delegates is

still in the hunt having won

Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and

Missouri...

RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)

A win in Ohio could turn it all

around for the Arkansas Senator...

RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

So one week from Tuesday the all

important hundred and eighty one

Ohio delegates could be the

deciding factor..

RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)

And once again the old adage is

true..."As goes Ohio, so goes the

Nation."

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

5.

CONTINUED:

CUT TO:

SENATOR PULLMAN

Would you call yourself a

Christian?

GOV. MORRIS

How would that matter?

SENATOR PULLMAN

(READING)

"I have no idea what happens when

we die, maybe nothing...maybe it

was like before we were born." You

did write this Governor...

GOV. MORRIS

Then let me try and clarify...I was

raised Catholic, I am not a

practicing Catholic...I have no

idea what happens when you die and

if the Senator does, then perhaps

he should be President. I'll even

vote for him.

SENATOR PULLMAN

Is that your idea of being

specific?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

6.

CONTINUED:

GOV. MORRIS

Let me be more specific. I am

neither a Christian, nor an

atheist, I'm not Jewish or

Muslim...what I believe...my

religion is written on a piece of

parchment called the Constitution.

Meaning I will defend, till my

dying breath, your right to

worship, in whatever God or lack

thereof you believe in, as long as

it doesn't hurt others. I believe

we should be judged as a government

by how we take care of those who

can't take care of themselves.

That's my religion. If you feel

that I'm not religious enough, then

don't vote for me. If you feel I'm

not experienced enough or tall

enough then don't vote for me.

Because I'm not going to change

those to get elected.

SENATOR PULLMAN

I just wanted you to say out loud

if you believed in the teachings of

the Bible.

GOV. MORRIS

Is this a Democratic primary or a

general election?

SENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR)

Well Governor, whoever wins this

contest will be running for

President...and if you don't think

that these questions won't be

central in a general election then

you are living in fantasy land. I

applaud your honesty Governor, I

do...I'm simply pointing to what is

obvious...we are running for

President of the United

States...not for student council

president.

(CONTINUED)

7.

CONTINUED:

PAUL

A double?

STEPHEN

A double.

PAUL

Fucking national security.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Outta the park.

STEPHEN

Home run.

DUFFY

I'm trying to remember if the

democrats ever nominated an atheist

before...

PAUL

Well, we know they've nominated

jackasses before.

DUFFY

(TO STEPHEN)

Must've been you that did the prep

work. Paul's not that clever.

PAUL

You always had the brains Duffy,

but me - I always had the balls.

(CONTINUED)

8.

CONTINUED: (2)

DUFFY

(nodding to Stephen)

Looks like you got some brains now

too. Be careful. I just might

have to steal him from you.

PAUL

What a prick.

CUT TO:

IDA

So Paul, tell me something I don't

know...tell me what's gonna happen

on the 15th.

PAUL

Ha-ha.

IDA

What?

PAUL

What do you think Stevie?

STEPHEN

It's ours for the taking.

PAUL

Ben?

BEN

We'll win.

PAUL

What do you think Ida?

IDA

I'm asking you.

PAUL

You tell me and I'll tell you.

(CONTINUED)

9.

CONTINUED:

IDA

If had to say, I'd say it'll be

close, but you'll eke it out.

PAUL

Eke?

PAUL (CONT'D)

You see, she's trying to get under

my skin.

IDA

So what's gonna happen?

PAUL

Us by nine.

IDA

Nine? There's no way you'll win by

nine.

STEPHEN

At least. Maybe more.

IDA

(To PAUL) So you're certain you're

gonna win here?

PAUL

Certain? No. Confident? Yes.

IDA

You just said you'll win by nine.

PAUL

And I think we will, but I won't

tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking

Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on

election day and get his four

horseman to rig the ballot boxes

for Pullman and it wouldn't

surprise me. Don't get me wrong.

Six presidentials I've done and

I've never felt this good. But am I

gonna sit here and say "Yes -we

will definitely win Ohio"? Not a

chance. In the last thirty years

seventy-three Democrats have run

for president. How many have won?

Three.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

10.

CONTINUED: (2)

PAUL (CONT'D)

That means seventy guys ran who

thought they had a chance, and they

all lost.

IDA

So you're saying there's a good

chance you won't win.

PAUL

Don't twist my words. What I'm

saying is that I'm not going to

promise we'll win. But he's

decorated by Bush Senior from the

first Gulf war and protested the

second. He left his state with a

balanced budget and the fourth

highest education rate. The

Republicans have nobody out there

that can touch this guy...so for

this moment, this election, this

primary is the presidential. And

that Ida, is the state of the

union. And on that note, I'm gonna

take a shit.

IDA

So Stephen...

STEPHEN

Yes Ida?

IDA

Stephen, Stephen, Stephen....

STEPHEN

Here it comes...hit me.

IDA

Paul's going to the airport?

STEPHEN

Yes?

IDA

Getting on a plane.

STEPHEN

Mmhmm.

IDA

Where is that plane going?

(CONTINUED)

11.

CONTINUED: (3)

STEPHEN

Three guesses.

IDA

Not going back to headquarters.

STEPHEN

Correct.

IDA

He's not going to Texas?

STEPHEN

No need, we'll split Texas, it's a

wash.

IDA

What if I said North Carolina?

STEPHEN

That's your guess?

IDA

He's going to North Carolina.

STEPHEN

I will neither confirm nor deny

that statement.

IDA

I knew it. Now tell me why.

STEPHEN

That I cannot do.

IDA

I hate you.

STEPHEN

You love me.

IDA

I love Paul. You I hate.

STEPHEN

You only love him because he gives

you all the scoops.

IDA

Sexual favors?

STEPHEN

You're engaged.

(CONTINUED)

12.

CONTINUED: (4)

IDA

If it meant a good scoop my fiance

would understand.

IDA (CONT'D)

You really buy into all this crap?

All this take back the country

nonsense?

STEPHEN

Ida I'm not naive about this stuff.

I've worked on more campaigns than

most people do by the time they're

forty...I'm telling you this is the

one.

IDA

You really have drunk the kool-aid.

STEPHEN

I have drunk it it's delicious.

I don't care whether he leads in

the polls...I don't care whether he

has all the tools...Because the

truth is, he's the only one that's

going to make a difference in

peoples lives...Even the people

that hate him. If Mike Morris is

President it says more about us

than it does about him. I don't

give a fuck if he can win. He has

to win.

IDA

Or what? The world will fall

apart? It won't matter...Not one

bit to the everyday lives of

everyday fuckers who work and eat

and sleep and get up and go back to

work again. If your boy wins...You

get a job in the white house...If

he loses you're back at a

consulting firm on K

Street...That's it. You used to

know that before you got all

goosebumpy about this guy. Morris

is a politician...He's a nice

guy...They're all nice guys.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

13.

CONTINUED: (5)

IDA (CONT'D)

He will let you down...sooner or

later.

CUT TO:

PAUL

This is off off off the record.

IDA

What?

PAUL

Franklin Thompson.

IDA

Seriously?

PAUL

Off the record. The only people who

know are the Governor, Stephen and

me.

IDA

My lips are sealed.

PAUL

I have a meeting tomorrow at

Thompson's house.

IDA

He's gonna endorse?

PAUL

After I'm done talking with him,

what do you think?

IDA

That's huge.

PAUL

It's more than huge. He has 356

pledged delegates...they all travel

with him. That puts us over the

top.

IDA

He's said publicly he's not gonna

endorse anyone.

(CONTINUED)

14.

CONTINUED:

PAUL

That's what they all say until we

get them alone in a room.

IDA

So this is for real?

PAUL

Yup. It's just about in the bag.

IDA

When are you gonna announce?

PAUL

Nope. That's all you get for now.

CUT TO:

BEN

Okay so listen up...these are your

new cell phones...Shelly has pre-

programmed everyone's numbers

in...thank you Shelly...no personal

calls...if you lose them, Paul has

authorized me to kill you.

BEN (CONT'D)

New phones...

STEPHEN

I'll get it in a bit...

(CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINUED:

GOV MORRIS (ON MONITOR)

The economy...health care...I've

got to believe we can do it. We

have enemies...we have to

understand why our enemies are our

enemies, and see if there is

something we can do about that

besides using force. What we know

from history is the answer to

extremism is not extremism.

Whoever is the next president,

whoever steps up, has got a lot of

work to do, but you have a little

work to do yourself.

STEPHEN

Fucking kill me...where did we get

this?

EDITOR

Before he announced at a town hall

meeting in Pennsylvania...

STEPHEN

Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just

get rid of it -

EDITOR

It plays to his base, if-

STEPHEN

Are you fucking stoned...this is

the same...the exact same piece the

Republicans are gonna run against

him in the general...we don't need

to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville

Chamberlain and I want to be your

commander in chief.

EDITOR

If it's gonna come out-

STEPHEN

It's gonna come out but not paid

for by us pal. (To Staffer) Any

truth on whether Pullman had

investments in those diamond mines

in Liberia?

(CONTINUED)

16.

CONTINUED: (2)

STAFFER 1

We're still checking...it was a

blog so who the fuck knows...

STEPHEN

Doesn't matter I want to hear him

denying it. If it's true, find

out, if it's not, let them spend

the next day telling the post that

he doesn't own a diamond mine in

Liberia...win win.

STAFFER 1

Okay.

STEPHEN

We need to counter this Christian

shit we're taking from last

night...so get going...Where's our

cut on the new thirty and a sixty

second spots? We'll show it to him

this afternoon in the staff

meeting.

EDITOR

Got it.

MOLLY

Ben wanted me to get you to sign

off on this before the staff

meeting.

STEPHEN

Oh, right. Thanks. I've been

waiting for this.

MOLLY

Anything interesting?

STEPHEN

Just some white paper I gotta pass

out tonight.

MOLLY

White paper?

(CONTINUED)

17.

CONTINUED: (3)

STEPHEN

Negative shit. Our oppo guys do

research - we feed it to the press,

hope they bite.

MOLLY

So like what sort of negative

stuff?

STEPHEN

Read tomorrow's paper and you'll

see.

MOLLY

Which paper?

STEPHEN

All of them.

MOLLY

So it's something big?

STEPHEN

I wish it were something bigger

actually. Just some transportation

numbers. I'll have to spin this

shit pretty heavy if we want it to

stick.

MOLLY

Well that's what you're good at,

right?

STEPHEN

I guess.

MOLLY

(Holding up her phone)

Did you get your phone?

STEPHEN

(Holds his up)

Just now.

MOLLY

(MOCK SERIOUS)

It's exciting isn't it?

STEPHEN

You a Bearcat...?

(CONTINUED)

18.

CONTINUED: (4)

MOLLY

A what?

STEPHEN

A Cincinnati Bearcat?

MOLLY

Oh no...I'm not from here...I

worked with you in Iowa actually.

STEPHEN

Oh that's right...but you changed

something. (Searching for a way

out.)

MOLLY

My hair?

STEPHEN

You changed your hair.

MOLLY

(ENJOYING THIS)

No..

STEPHEN

I must look like a total dumb ass

right now.

MOLLY

Not at all...you're the big man on

campus...I'm just a lowly intern.

STEPHEN

Come on it's not like that.

MOLLY

Sure it is...you get to stay at the

Millennium, they put us into a

motel on the other side of the

river.

STEPHEN

You're right, I am big man on

campus.

MOLLY

Now you're starting to see.

MOLLY (CONT'D)

We do have the better bar though.

(CONTINUED)

19.

CONTINUED: (5)

STEPHEN

I heard that.

MOLLY

You ought to stop by one night and

have a drink with the worker bees.

STEPHEN

Maybe I will...when's a good night?

MOLLY

Tonight's good...

STEPHEN

Really? Tuesday?

MOLLY

Yeah it's quiet.

STEPHEN

Quiet's good.

MOLLY

Well you have my number.

STEPHEN

I do?

MOLLY

Programmed right there in your

phone.

STEPHEN

Oh...right...(He opens the phone)

MOLLY

Under Mary.

STEPHEN

(Looking at the phone)

Yup...Mary.

MOLLY

Molly...my name's Molly...

CUT TO:

20.

SENATOR THOMPSON

That's what I'm hearing...since

Super Tuesday I'm a very popular

guy. What are your polls telling

you?

PAUL

That Pullman's negatives are

high...mid forties. Senator we

have an open seat in the White

House and the Republicans don't

have dick. They're disorganized

and they can't find a nominee that

isn't a world class fuck up. They

look like Democrats. No Republican

is gonna show up to vote for their

guy. But if Pullman gets the

Democratic nod they'll show up to

vote against him.

SENATOR THOMPSON

And so you think they won't for

your guy...you think Morris gets

into the independents?

PAUL

I sure do. Senator...I'm a bit

confused...we need your

delegates...we need you...your fund

raising. It was my understanding

that...your endorsement a week

before Ohio...would win this for

us...

SENATOR THOMPSON

(Looks to his aide)

Estella...hand me that ice bucket.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

21.

CONTINUED:

STEPHEN

Paul knows...Paul agrees...

GOV. MORRIS

Ben, where's my op ed on national

service? It's better for me to

work off of that.

BEN

Got it right here. (He opens his

laptop.)

GOV. MORRIS

Get me a hard copy...I hate these

fucking things...

STEPHEN

Print it out.

BEN

I'll get it printed.

Molly, I'm printing out this op

ed...can you grab it off the

printer?

MOLLY

Be right back.

STEPHEN

Governor...if you want to

change...or lets call it refresh...

GOV. MORRIS

Just give me a second...

STEPHEN

National service isn't polling like

the rest of your domestic policy.

GOV. MORRIS

I don't give a shit about

polling...I'm not going to play

this game with you Stephen...and if

this is your good cop bad cop act

with Paul...

STEPHEN

Good cop, good cop.

GOV. MORRIS

I'm not changing it.

(CONTINUED)

22.

CONTINUED: (2)

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

Hang on.

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

Yeah I said it all here, "It's

going to help people get an

education...it's going to create

national unity...it's going to

teach young people a trade...and

it's going to help get people out

of debt from college loans. Tell

me where that fails.

STEPHEN

All of that is exactly

right...Governor if you're going to

do it...then do it. Don't make it

voluntary...mandatory.

GOV. MORRIS

That'll poll well.

STEPHEN

Mandatory!...everyone who graduates

high school or turns eighteen,

gives two years to his or her

country. Military...peace

corps...plant fucking trees, I

don't care...and for that...their

college education is paid

for...period.

GOV. MORRIS

We do all of that now, with this...

STEPHEN

No sir you don't...do it all...all

the way. Mandatory.

GOV. MORRIS

Paul likes this?...you guys are my

brain trust.

STEPHEN

And here's the beauty of

it...everyone who is older than

eighteen and past the age of

eligibility, would be for

it...create national pride...give

all the kids an education.

(CONTINUED)

23.

CONTINUED: (3)

GOV. MORRIS

And all the others?

STEPHEN

Can't vote. Too young.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

You can't lose.

MOLLY

Stephen you have a call on three,

your dad.

GOV. MORRIS

Okay, you and Ben work it into the

stump speech - get me a hard copy

and I'll write it in my own words.

STEPHEN

Remember, Governor... you have a

six o'clock with Charlie Rose...

GOV. MORRIS

Why am I doing him?

STEPHEN

It's long form... he's flying in...

GOV. MORRIS

Is Paul going?

STEPHEN

No, he won't be back... Ben and I

are taking you...

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

...Don't tell me anyone's died...

DUFFY

Hey Stephen...

(CONTINUED)

24.

CONTINUED:

STEPHEN

Who is this?

DUFFY

Tom Duffy...sorry about the dad

bit...but I didn't think you'd want

my name yelled out at a Morris

campaign office.

STEPHEN

What do you want?

DUFFY

You got a couple of minutes...I'd

like to sit down with you.

STEPHEN

What for?

DUFFY

I think it's important.

STEPHEN

If it's important shouldn't you be

calling Paul?

DUFFY

I'm calling you...This is all on

the up and up...just give me five

minutes.

STEPHEN

I can't be talking to you...

DUFFY

I hear you...but if you get five

minutes...I'll be at the Heads

First Sports Bar for the next

couple of hours.

STEPHEN

I can't Tom.

DUFFY

There won't be anybody there...if

you get a chance there's something

I want to show you.

(CONTINUED)

25.

STEPHEN

Paul, listen, call me as soon as

you can...it's important.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DUFFY

You're working for the wrong man.

STEPHEN

You're working for the wrong man.

DUFFY

Oh on the contrary you are working

for the wrong man. You've got

something the other guys don't

have.

STEPHEN

Yeah?

DUFFY

Yeah, what is it exactly? Charm

isn't the right word. It's more

than that. You exude something. You

draw people in. All the reporters

love you. Even the ones that hate

you love you. You play them all

like they're pieces on a chess

board. And you make it look

effortless. We both know how much

work it takes, constantly being on

guard, weighing every word so

carefully, every move. But from the

outside, you make it look easy.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

26.

CONTINUED:

DUFFY (CONT'D)

People are scared of you because

they don't understand how you do

it, and they love you for it.

There's nothing more valuable in

this business - the ability to win

people's respect by making them

mistake their fear for love. You

can guess what I'm gonna say next.

STEPHEN

No...I don't think I can.

DUFFY

I want you to work for us.

STEPHEN

You gotta be kidding me.

DUFFY

Not in the least.

You are going to lose Ohio.

STEPHEN

I am not.

DUFFY

You're sitting on about a six

percent lead in both polls...six

percent of the Democrats polled.

STEPHEN

Eight.

DUFFY

Six...but that doesn't

matter...Independents and

Republicans can vote for the

Democratic candidate.

STEPHEN

You think they like your guy?...pro

choice...tax and spend liberal?

(CONTINUED)

27.

CONTINUED: (2)

DUFFY

Fuck no they hate him...they

think they can beat my guy...but

they're worried about yours...so

starting tomorrow morning you're

gonna see a fucking blitz...Rush

Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the

right wing blogs are gonna start a

"Get out the vote campaign"...it's

already started...every fucking

conservative in Ohio is gonna stand

in line and punch my guys

ticket...that's just one of the

steps...Ohio is gone...the polls

don't mean shit...tomorrow morning

everyone will know...that's why I

want you to handle the fallout

we'll take in the press...

DUFFY (CONT'D)

And by the way...we've got Thompson

in the bag.

STEPHEN

I know for a fact that Thompson is

going with us.

DUFFY

We promised him Secretary of State,

Ohio is over...it's been over for

weeks...and with Thompson's

delegates...I'm thinking down the

road now...that's why I want

you...I'll bring you in straight at

the top.

STEPHEN

I can't do it.

DUFFY

I'm not asking for an answer right

this moment.

STEPHEN

I've played dirty but I don't have

to play dirty anymore...you know

why? Cause I got Morris!

(CONTINUED)

28.

CONTINUED: (3)

DUFFY

None of this is about the

democratic process Steve, It's

about getting your guy into office.

Simple as that.

STEPHEN

This is the sort of shit the

Republicans pull.

DUFFY

You're right, this is exactly what

the Republicans do, and it's about

time we learned from them. They're

meaner, tougher and more

disciplined than we are. I've been

in this business for twenty five

years and I've seen way too many

Democrats bite the dust because

they wouldn't get down in the mud

with the fucking elephants.

STEPHEN

Paul's a friend.

DUFFY

Do you want to work for a friend or

do you want to work for the

President? Think about it...you

have my number.

CUT TO:

RESIDENTIAL STREET

need me. I fly to DC tomorrow and

back tomorrow night.

STEPHEN

Yeah okay...I'll look for

PAUL (O.S.)

Good man.

STEPHEN

(TO BEN)

Just get online and see if there's

any chatter on the blogs...

BEN

What kind of chatter? There's

STEPHEN

I don't know... just see what

GOV. MORRIS

Stephen... you're still single,

right?

STEPHEN

I'm married to the campaign,

Governor.

GOV. MORRIS

Good answer.

(to the make-up girl)

He's married to the campaign...

BEN

(looking at his computer)

Wall Street Journal poll has our

numbers holding steady and Pullman

dropped a point.

STEPHEN

Really? When did they do that?

Governor... Wall Street Journal

numbers are in... and Pullman's

down a point.

GOV. MORRIS

Now we're moving in the right

direction. Ben, are you still

single?

BEN

I'm married to the campaign,

Governor.

GOV. MORRIS

(to the make-up girl)

Crack team.

STEPHEN

(TO BEN)

Make sure Charlie Rose has these

latest numbers before he goes on...

BEN

(JUMPS UP)

I'm on it.

STEPHEN

And get a copy of the show before

we leave...

HARD CUT TO:

ON AIR-

GOV. MORRIS

Is it a difficult decision? I

would have to believe that it is...

would I do it? No... but I can't

see myself... or anyone...

certainly not a government, telling

a woman what she can do with her

body.

CHARLIE ROSE

So you would appoint a judge to...

GOV. MORRIS

... I would consider it arrogant to

judge someone until I've walked in

their shoes.

CHARLIE ROSE

But you're against the death

penalty?

GOV. MORRIS

Yes. Because of what it says about

us as a society.

CHARLIE ROSE

Suppose Governor it was your

wife...

GOV. MORRIS

And she was murdered, what would I

do.

CHARLIE ROSE

It gets more complicated when it's

personal.

(CONTINUED)

32.

CONTINUED:

GOV. MORRIS

Sure...well if I could get to him

I'd find a way to kill him.

CHARLIE ROSE

So you, you Governor would impose

the death penalty.

GOV. MORRIS

No, I would commit a crime for

which I would happily go to jail.

CHARLIE ROSE

Then why not let society do that?

GOV. MORRIS

Because society has to be better

than the individual. If I were to

do that I would be wrong.

And what about guns?

Isn't it time for a commercial.

They laugh.

CHARLIE ROSE

This is public TV, we don't have

GOV. MORRIS

That's unfortunate.

INT. MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT

We're in Kentucky, just over the Ohio River from Cincinnati.

This is where all the interns stay.

In the hotel bar, Stephen and Molly are sitting at a back

table, they've both been drinking hard.

STEPHEN

Where'd you go after Iowa?

MOLLY

California for Super Tuesday.

STEPHEN

I had to go to New York.

(CONTINUED)

33.

CONTINUED:

MOLLY

I know...you guys needed a lot more

help over there.

STEPHEN

Yeah. So why politics?

MOLLY

Because the pay is so good.

STEPHEN

It just seems like an odd fit.

MOLLY

My dad is Jack Stearns.

STEPHEN

He's a good guy.

MOLLY

He's an asshole but he's your boss.

STEPHEN

He's not my boss. He's the head of

the DNC.

MOLLY

You don't work for the Democratic

National Committee?

STEPHEN

I work for Paul, Paul works for

Morris and if Morris wins, he's

going to be your dad's boss.

MOLLY

Don't tell my dad that.

STEPHEN

Don't tell your dad a lot of

things.

MOLLY

Never.

STEPHEN

What time do you start tomorrow?

(CONTINUED)

34.

CONTINUED: (2)

MOLLY

Nine AM...I'm showing the new

interns how to robo call...you

see...I'm the experienced intern.

STEPHEN

I do see...

MOLLY

How old are you?

STEPHEN

How old do you think I am?

MOLLY

Thirty?

STEPHEN

You think I'm thirty?

MOLLY

I'm sorry, how old are you?

STEPHEN

Thirty...how old are you?

MOLLY

How old do you think I am?

STEPHEN

Twenty one?

MOLLY

Twenty.

STEPHEN

That's young.

MOLLY

Too young to fuck a thirty year

old?

STEPHEN

See laws are different in different

states. Here in your hotel, in

Kentucky...it's frowned upon...but

we'll go across the bridge into

Ohio...

MOLLY

Where your hotel is?

(CONTINUED)

35.

CONTINUED: (3)

STEPHEN

Yeah surprisingly they're very lax

about their child endangerment

laws...

MOLLY

You have a car? I don't drive.

STEPHEN

I took a cab.

MOLLY

I have the keys to the campaign

bus...

CUT TO:

CHRIS MATTHEWS (ON TV)

In fairness, this has been tried

before...Operation Chaos, as Rush

Limbaugh called it, where

Republicans voted for a Democrat

they thought they could beat in the

general election. We asked Senator

Pullman's campaign manager if this

sudden right wing support is

welcome...

(CONTINUED)

36.

CONTINUED:

DUFFY (O.S.)

Is it decisive?...Of Course

not...look, we believe that the

polls are within the margin of

error and that the Senator will win

Ohio...with Ohio Democrats...I

can't really see Republicans

showing up to vote for our

candidate...having said that, we'll

take all the support we can get.

STEPHEN

(On the phone)

What time does Paul land?...

Christ...who do we talk to about

polling?...no...I just...I just

need to get some internal polling

on the fucking Independents and the

right-wing nuts.

MOLLY

Do you want me to go?

STEPHEN

Listen, put me on the line

with...what's the guy's name at the

Wall Street Journal?... yeah...

MOLLY

You seem busy...I should go.

STEPHEN

Wait.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Right...Adler...get me on the line

with him.

MOLLY

Steve?

STEPHEN

Molly listen, just give me a

second...I want to talk to you

about something.

(CONTINUED)

37.

CONTINUED: (2)

MOLLY

We can talk about it later if...

STEPHEN

(INTO PHONE)

What? No nobody...just the cleaning

lady...listen Ben...keep trying

till you get him. We're gonna go

with the position that we've always

said, the race is closer than the

polling...right...no don't...don't

say that...just get him on the line

and call me...I'll handle it...yup.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Sorry about that.

MOLLY

The cleaning lady.

STEPHEN

What?

MOLLY

You called me the cleaning lady.

STEPHEN

You're not mad about that are you?

MOLLY

No why would I be mad?

MOLLY (CONT'D)

Look.

CHRIS MATHEWS

Earlier I spoke with Jack Stearns,

head of the DNC, and he had this to

say...

(CONTINUED)

38.

CONTINUED: (3)

JACK STEARNS

I know you're looking for a

reaction, but listen we have two

great candidates in a very tight

race...and at the end of the day

the voters will decide who best can

represent this party in the fall.

CHRIS MATHEWS

I understand Jack - but doesn't

this kind of disruption take away

from what you want to be pushing

this year?

STEPHEN

Your dad is an asshole.

MOLLY

I'll tell him you said that.

STEPHEN

Do that.

MOLLY

You said you wanted to talk to me

about something?

STEPHEN

Yeah, I just wanted...I just wanted

to be clear about everything...so

there's no confusion...

MOLLY

I won't tell anyone about last

night.

STEPHEN

Well yeah, I'd appreciate it if we

kept this...I mean, you know how

people are.

MOLLY

Really wouldn't look good if you

screwed an intern.

STEPHEN

It's not like I got drunk and this

happened...I mean...I wanted to...I

really like you...you're

smart...but I just...I don't want

there to be any expectations...

(CONTINUED)

39.

CONTINUED: (4)

MOLLY

Steven, you don't have to say

anything.

STEPHEN

I just don't want you to think I'm

some kind of player.

MOLLY

Well you are kind of a player, but

that's okay.

STEPHEN

No I'm not. I was being polite.

MOLLY

Bullshit...you were trying to pick

me up.

STEPHEN

No I wasn't.

MOLLY

You were pretty obvious about it.

STEPHEN

I was?

MOLLY

Totally.

STEPHEN

I thought I was being all smooth

and subtle.

MOLLY

You were pretty forward.

STEPHEN

You were pretty forward ...inviting

me to the bar.

MOLLY

Well...I've been trying to fuck you

for a while.

STEPHEN

Wow.

MOLLY

Pretty slutty of me, huh?

(CONTINUED)

40.

CONTINUED: (5)

STEPHEN

No, not at all...I mean I kind of

respect it in a weird sort of way.

MOLLY

Good.

STEPHEN

You have absolutely no idea how to

tie a tie do you...

MOLLY

No no not a clue.

STEPHEN

You're very mature.

MOLLY

For a teenager.

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

When are you coming back?

PAUL

I'll be at the event...a little

late...these cock suckers...fucking

dirty shit.

STEPHEN

What happened with Thompson?

PAUL

Nothing, the prick...we had him all

sewed up...MOTHER FUCKER...how bad

is it?

STEPHEN

I'm running some numbers now...I

don't know...

(CONTINUED)

41.

CONTINUED:

PAUL

Alright, I'll be there in three

hours...I want hard numbers...and a

strategy.

STEPHEN

Yeah I'm on it...I gotta go.

GOV. MORRIS

You okay?

STEPHEN

Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure

out our stops on the ground.

GOV. MORRIS

I think the weather might determine

that. If we get there.

STEPHEN

We'll be fine...we have to do

it...and it's the right thing.

Nothing bad happens when it's the

right thing.

GOV. MORRIS

Is this your personal

theory...cause I can shoot holes in

it...Roberto Clemente...on a

humanitarian flight.

STEPHEN

Well there are exceptions to every

rule...

GOV. MORRIS

So how we doin?

STEPHEN

Fine now.

(CONTINUED)

42.

GOV. MORRIS

No I mean...the campaign how we

doin?

STEPHEN

Great...

GOV. MORRIS

Listen Stephen...you're not Paul.

I pay him to use the word "great".

I pay you to tell me the truth.

STEPHEN

I think we're solid.

GOV. MORRIS

Okay Paul.

STEPHEN

Governor there's a big difference

between Paul and me. Paul only

believes in winning so he'll do or

say anything to win.

GOV. MORRIS

But you wouldn't.

STEPHEN

I'll do or say anything if I

believe in it...but I have to

believe in the cause.

GOV. MORRIS

You'll make a lousy consultant when

you're out of this line of work.

STEPHEN

Well I won't be out of this line of

work as long as you're in it.

GOV. MORRIS

So at best you've got eight

years...then you'll end up with a

nice little consultant firm on

Farragut North...eating at the

Palm...pulling in seven hundred and

fifty grand a year...pimping out

Senators to Saudi Princes.

STEPHEN

Pimping out ex presidents...

(CONTINUED)

43.

CONTINUED: (2)

GOV. MORRIS

Then I better win...

STEPHEN

Yeah.

CUT TO:

GOV. MORRIS

Now, I've been married for eleven

years, to the smartest person I

know...and we have a normal

marriage...which means when we

disagree...she wins. What we don't

ever disagree on is how we're going

to leave this planet for our

daughter. Are we gonna leave it

better off, or worse? The richest

people in this country don't pay

their fare share. And when they're

asked to, they cry socialism, they

use phrases like redistribution of

wealth. That scares everybody and

they all run and they hide. For

the record, my campaign is

vehemently against the distribution

of wealth to the richest Americans,

by our government! And I will run

on that!

STEPHEN

I didn't think it was true.

PAUL

Whoa...

STEPHEN

But I should have told you this

yesterday...sorry...

(CONTINUED)

44.

CONTINUED:

PAUL

-Slow down.

STEPHEN

I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.

PAUL

What?

STEPHEN

You were on a plane and he called

me and he asked if we could

meet...And I said why...he said it

was very important so I did...but I

should've fucking told you...

PAUL

Stop Stop let me get this straight.

You met with Tom Duffy?

STEPHEN

Yes.

PAUL

What'd he want Stephen?

STEPHEN

-the gist of it is he wants to hire

me. He wants me to jump ship and

come work for him...this is bad

Paul. He showed me poll numbers

with Pullman ahead by four. We're

in really deep fucking trouble he

laid out their whole plan. Robo-

calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and

fucking Thompson. They promised him

Secretary of State.

CUT TO:

GOV. MORRIS

You know how you fight the war on

terror?...Don't need their product

anymore. Their product is oil,

just don't need it and they go

away. We don't have to bomb anyone

we don't have to invade anyone!

CUT TO:

45.

PAUL

If this is some sort of practical-I

mean -my fucking blood pressure is

going through the roof right now.

STEPHEN

Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I

just didn't think it was true.

PAUL

It doesn't fucking matter what you

thought. It matters what you did.

It matters what you didn't do. If

all this shit is true I made a

fucking ass of myself at Thompson's

place. And I gave away our game

plan.

STEPHEN

Please believe me that I honestly

believed you were gonna come back

and you were gonna tell me that we

have Thompson in the bag and I

didn't see the point. But it

doesn't make it right and I'm

sorry.

PAUL

Let me think...let me think...

CUT TO:

GOV. MORRIS

If I'm your president, the first

thing I put in motion, ten years

from the day I'm in office...no new

car in America runs on an internal

combustion engine. It'll create

hundreds of thousands of new

jobs...we will start the next

technological revolution and we

will lead the world again...like we

used to...

CUT TO:

46.

PAUL

We get the Governor right after he

finishes singing Kum Bay Ya and

give him everything we know.

STEPHEN

Who do you want...

PAUL

You, me and the Governor, that's

it! What's he got after?

STEPHEN

A fund-raiser in Cleveland tonight.

PAUL

He'll be late...we're gonna tell

him that if he doesn't offer

Thompson a cabinet position...he's

not gonna get the nomination.

STEPHEN

Will he go for it?

PAUL

I don't fucking know Stephen.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Find us a room...

CUT TO:

GOV. MORRIS

How real are the numbers?

(CONTINUED)

47.

CONTINUED:

STEPHEN

We might pick up a couple of

points...but we're...I don't know,

we lose by three or four percent.

PAUL

Who the fuck knows Governor...but

we can't take the chance...

GOV. MORRIS

What do you think?

PAUL

I think we fold up the campaign in

Ohio...take a loss and blame it on

the Republican's playing

games...head to North Carolina.

GOV. MORRIS

I can't run from Ohio...they'll

kill us.

PAUL

Not if you get Thompson's

endorsement.

GOV. MORRIS

I'm not gonna do it. What's he

want head of the FDA or something

ridiculous?

STEPHEN

Cabinet post.

GOV. MORRIS

Labor?

STEPHEN

State...

GOV. MORRIS

Are you fucking kidding me...I'm

gonna give Secretary of State to a

guy who wants to cut the top ten

floors off the UN? Paul when we

started this campaign I said I

wasn't gonna make those kind of

deals.

(CONTINUED)

48.

CONTINUED: (2)

PAUL

Governor, if you lose Ohio, and

they get Thompson's

delegates...Then they get North

Carolina...then they get the lead.

A lead you can't beat. But if we

walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give

him a cabinet post, then we take

North Carolina. His state. Then

Pennsylvania. Your state. And

then it's simple math Mike. Take

his endorsement and the race is

over.

GOV. MORRIS

Paul, I respect you...respect your

opinion...but I'm never gonna do

it...so I suggest we find a way for

me to win Ohio.

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

Anything else?

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

(On the phone)

Do we have any other senators that

can go to bat for us? House

members won't do.

BEN

(Whispering to him)

Or a Congressman from Ohio maybe.

STEPHEN

Right...but we need a Senator...one

from Ohio would be nice.

This is all the car rental

companies in Northern

Ohio...they've booked every single

van for Tuesday...

Fuck...Jess, I'll call you back...

(To Molly) All of them? Goddamit!

BEN

(On the computer)

Here's what I have so

far...Independents don't seem to be

biting, but Republicans are...or

say they are.

STEPHEN

They're not gonna tell a pollster

that they're gonna vote

Democratic...I don't even know how

to read these polls.

MOLLY

I called and we can get a hundred

vans out of Covington and Newport

Kentucky.

STEPHEN

We don't need the fucking vans...we

just don't want Pullman to have

them...

PAUL

No, No that's not what I'm

saying...we were the underdog

before we got into this and we

continue to be the underdog...well

the numbers...we knew the numbers

would get closer the closer we got

to Tuesday...I'm not lowering

expectations...have you ever heard

me say that we had Ohio locked?...

Then at least give me the courtesy

of printing that in your column.

Congressman from the first

He's a shit.

CINDY

Worse than Pullman?

GOV. MORRIS

Yes Stephen.

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

GOV. MORRIS

From a religious to a civil rights

issue.

STUDENT 1

But one could argue a great

difference between gender and race.

GOV. MORRIS

Not really. They used to ban

interracial marriage...women

couldn't vote...the list goes on...

STUDENT 1

The argument of course-

GOV. MORRIS

Now wait she has a point to

make....

STUDENT 1

The argument is that men and women,

can in fact be separate but equal,

races cannot.

GOV. MORRIS

How so?

You have separate public bathrooms

for men and women but it would be

So that's what I'm saying.

BEN

Nine o'clock.

STEPHEN

How'd he do?

BEN

He did good.

CUT TO:

55.

GOV. MORRIS

See we're framing the argument

based on the idea that

homosexuality is a choice, you

choose to be gay, not that you were

born that way like being born

black. Because if you start the

discussion with the idea that gay

is not a life choice but part of

your DNA, then gay marriage is and

can only be a civil rights issue.

STUDENT 2

Do you think candor is your appeal?

Is that what you're running on as

much as your platform...?

We'll see. It'll drive them to the

I've given you everything -every

fucking scoop, your profile with

IDA

You're right -you've given me a

Steve. The only reason you ever

treated me well was that I work

for the Times. Not because I was

your friend. You give me what I

want, I write you better stories.

Don't pretend it's any more than

that. Why'd you meet with Duffy?

Go fuck yourself.

Okay, I'll make it easier on you.

Forget Duffy. What happened at

DUFFY

You can't let this story get out.

STEPHEN

I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.

DUFFY

You don't have much of a choice

here.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

STEPHEN

If I tell her about Thompson I

gotta tell her he's gonna endorse

you guys.

DUFFY

Then tell her. I can handle it

from my side if I start getting

calls.

STEPHEN

No fucking way. Paul told her we

had Thompson in the bag. It'll make

us look like fools.

DUFFY

You're gonna look like fools

anyway when he endorses us.

STEPHEN

I can't do it.

DUFFY

You're on a sinking ship Steve.

Tell her what she wants to know

and jump. Come over to our side.

We can control this thing.

DUFFY (CONT'D)

Steve?

STEPHEN

I Gotta go.

STEPHEN

I'm up here.

MOLLY

(STARTLED)

Shit, you scared me.

STEPHEN

Take this.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

It's almost 1800 bucks... you make

the appointment now... today...

from a pay phone... I'll take you

to the clinic and pick you up... no

one else... you understand?

MOLLY

Yes.

STEPHEN

You take the rest of the money and

you buy a ticket home... you can't

be here anymore... we can't afford

it... not with everything that's

gonna happen in the next week. This

situation just can't be here.

MOLLY

You mean I can't be here.

STEPHEN

Right.

MOLLY

But I would never tell anyone...

STEPHEN

I would hope not.

MOLLY

Then why?

STEPHEN

You fucked up, Molly...

MOLLY

He and I both fucked up.

(CONTINUED)

69.

CONTINUED: (2)

STEPHEN

But I have a responsibility to

him... and more importantly I have

a responsibility to this campaign.

MOLLY

I could go to North Carolina and

work on the campaign...

STEPHEN

Molly you've go to wake the fuck

up... this is the big leagues...

it's mean...and when you make

mistakes you lose your right to

play. Make the appointment and

tell me when and where we have to

go.

CUT TO:

BEN

Listen to this. I got the

placement in the Times...this is a

match up of hope versus fear. Nine

times out of ten the fear candidate

tends to be the most

experienced...but in our

presidential races the least

experienced candidate almost always

wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter

versus Ford...Bush versus Gore...I

like our chances with the new kid

on the block, end quote. Thomas

Fucking Duffy...he's gotta be

having a stroke right now.

CUT TO:

70.

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

So just call me when you can leave

okay.

MOLLY

(Looking at the clinic)

I hate this shit...

STEPHEN

I'll be back, this'll all be

over...

MOLLY

Yeah...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

PAUL

Absolutely -there's no question

about it ....

PAUL (CONT'D)

But we've got to think broader

strokes here, rethink

everything....uh-huh....Yeah, I

know how to handle

it....Look,Stevie just got here.

Can I call you back in a few

minutes? ..Okay, bye. (He hangs up)

The Governor. We had a good long

talk on the way back. He's up to

speed with everything.

STEPHEN

How'd he take it?

PAUL

Better than I thought he would.

Still won't take Thompson's

endorsement.

STEPHEN

Paul-I gotta tell you something.

PAUL

What's up?

STEPHEN

Ida knows I met with Duffy.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

I don't know how she found out.

Tried to blackmail me. Said she was

gonna let the story out if I didn't

tell her what happened at your

meeting with Thompson.

PAUL

So it's gonna hit the papers.

STEPHEN

Probably. Yeah. Whoever she takes

it to, they're gonna call me for a

statement.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

72.

CONTINUED: (2)

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

I could just deny the whole thing,

but if they call Duffy and he

admits to it, that could look

worse. If I say no comment they

won't let up.

PAUL

I leaked it to Ida.

PAUL (CONT'D)

At the event.

STEPHEN

I don't understand.

PAUL

We made a deal.

STEPHEN

Paul...they're gonna print that

story in the paper tomorrow

morning.

PAUL

I know.

STEPHEN

But why? Why would you do that to

me? Why would you do that to the

campaign.

PAUL

The campaign will survive.

STEPHEN

Then why would you do that to me?

PAUL

Makes it easier to let you go.

STEPHEN

What?

PAUL

Why'd you meet with Duffy?

STEPHEN

I made a mistake - a stupid

mistake.

(CONTINUED)

73.

CONTINUED: (3)

PAUL

No Stephen. You didn't make a

mistake. You made a choice. You

called me and left a message to

call back...that it was important.

But when I did...you said to forget

about it. You chose not to tell

me. Why did you make that choice?

STEPHEN

I didn't think it was important.

PAUL

Sure you did. But you went because

you were curious, because you were

flattered. Because it made you feel

special to think Duffy wanted to

speak to you instead of me. Because

you thought to yourself: maybe I

can get something out of this.

Because it made you feel big.

First campaign I ran tiny little

race in Kentucky -state senate

seat. Workin for redneck nobody

named McGuthrie. Had no money, no

staff, no fuckin office. Everyone

thought we didn't stand a chance.

There's no way we can compete. And

about this time, a guy running a

congressional campaign a few

districts over gives me a call.

Says, "I really like what you were

able to do for poor ole' Sam. But

let's face it, he's a goner, so why

don't you come work for me?" What

do I do? Well Stephen -this is

where you and I are different. I

told Sam about the call. And Sam

says to me, "Paul, you think this

other's guy's got a shot at

winning, and he can pay you more

than anything I can afford, so if

it's what you feel you need to do,

then I won't get in your way." So I

say, "Sam -you took a chance and

hired me when I was even more of

nobody than you are, and I'd be

damned if I'm gonna jump ship just

because the shit hit the fan."

We lost the race, but three years

later, when Sam decided to run for

Governor -who do you think he

called? We won that race.

PAUL (CONT'D)

And twenty years later I'm where I

am now. (Beat) There's only one

thing I value in this world Steve,

and that's loyalty. Without it

you're nothing and you have no one.

And in politics it's the only

currency that you can count on.

That's why I'm letting you go. Not

because you're not good enough. But

I value trust over skill. And I

don't trust you anymore.

STEPHEN

Well it really isn't whether you

trust me, it's whether the Governor

does.

PAUL

The Governor knows, he thinks it's

the right thing to do.

STEPHEN

He does.

PAUL

If I were you? I'd get a good night

sleep because you're gonna get

fucking pounded by calls from the

press in the morning...

CUT TO:

NURSE

These are Vicodin...they're for the

pain. You have Ambien...that'll

there would be some bleeding?

MOLLY

I'm not feeling great Ben...

BEN

You picked a hell of day to call in

sick...Jesus...fucking wild day...

MOLLY

Why?

BEN

Stephen's off the campaign. Paul

fired him. Some fucking set up

about loyalty and it looks like

Stephen was doubling down with

Duffy on the Pullman campaign. I

was sitting in the room when Paul

told Stephen that he was fired.

Stephen said who's gonna take over

and Paul said me...and I'm

like...easy there soldier...but

Stephen goes ape shit then Paul

gives the speech about loyalty and

then shits on Stephen like I've

NEVER SEEN

before...christ...humiliating shit.

DUFFY

A reporter at Roll Call phoned me

this afternoon.

STEPHEN

I know who leaked it.

DUFFY

Who?

STEPHEN

Paul.

DUFFY

You told Paul?

STEPHEN

Yeah. I told him we met. He leaked

it.

DUFFY

You shouldn't have told him that.

STEPHEN

I felt like I should.

DUFFY

I've worked with Paul. He gets

paranoid.

STEPHEN

Obviously.

DUFFY

So he fired you.

STEPHEN

I quit.

DUFFY

You're lying to me...come on...

STEPHEN

I quit! And I can give you

everything on Morris. Everything.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

I can lay out his whole strategy

for you.

DUFFY

I already know his strategy. Paul

gave it all to Thompson.

STEPHEN

What if I had something else?

DUFFY

You'd do that to Morris? To Paul?

STEPHEN

Yeah.

DUFFY

Revenge makes people unpredictable

Steve. I can't have someone who's

unpredictable. Who's unstable.

STEPHEN

(CALMLY)

I'm not unstable.

DUFFY

If it had been a clean break -if

you'd left Morris before this story

broke, that'd be one thing. That we

could control. But the way it'd

look now -Paul fires you and then

you come work for us. Looks like

we're picking up the scraps. Puts

Morris in the drivers seat. I can't

have that.

STEPHEN

What if I had something big?

DUFFY

Like what?

STEPHEN

Something big. Something that'll

bring Morris down.

DUFFY

What is it?

Give me the job.

DUFFY

It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

Go take a nice long vacation.

DUFFY (CONT'D)

You're a smart guy Steve.

Everything I said yesterday is

true. But maybe politics isn't for

you.

STEPHEN

Politics is my life.

DUFFY

Do yourself a favor. Get out now

while you still can. Go into

entertainment, or business, or open

a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica -

anything. Do what will make you

happy. You stay in this business

long enough it makes you jaded and

cynical.

STEPHEN

Like you?

DUFFY

Yeah. Just like me.

STEPHEN

You knew I was gonna tell Paul.

DUFFY

I didn't know. I thought you might,

but I didn't know.

STEPHEN

You knew if I told him he'd fire

me.

DUFFY

Thing you gotta know about Paul-

he's big on loyalty.

STEPHEN

Yeah I got a nice speech on that.

You were never gonna hire me.

DUFFY

Put yourself in my shoes Steve.

Your opponent has the best media

mind in the country working on his

team. What do you try to do? You

either try to hire him yourself, or

work it so if you can't have him,

the other team can't either. This

was a win-win situation for me. You

work for us -great. Paul doesn't

have you. Then again, if Paul fires

you and I don't take you -fine -

Paul still doesn't have you. Either

way I win. The moment I got you to

sit down in that chair, I knew I'd

won.

STEPHEN

This is my life you're talking

about.

DUFFY

It's not easy for me to do this

sort of thing Steve. Don't think I

take any pleasure in it. I'm sorry

The coroner has stated, that based

on the evidence found by the police

in the hotel room, that this was an

accidental overdose, a lethal

cocktail of alcohol and

prescription drugs. The Cincinnati

police chief, Darryl Mathews, has

called for a full investigation

pending a toxicology report which

could take up to two weeks. Just a

terrible terrible situation for the

former Senator, now DNC Chairman,

Jack Stearns and his family.

SENATOR THOMPSON

I want on the ticket...you need me

delegates...you could use em before

Tuesday. Make a fine story on the

appears to be a drug...an

accidental prescription overdose.

Ida?

IDA

Is suicide ruled out?

GOV. MORRIS

We have no reason to believe...

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

I don't think we have any of that

information yet. Obviously there

will be a full investigation. Just

wanted to say that our hearts go

out...our prayers go out to the

entire family...and she was part of

our family.

REPORTER 5

Did you know her well Governor?

GOV. MORRIS

Not well. But I did know her, and

what I saw was a hard working,

young woman, with a great and

positive spirit. It's a very sad

day in our campaign and a very sad

day for the people close to Jack.

REPORTER 6

How long has she interned with you

Governor?

PAUL

She'd only been on the road with us

for a few weeks...maybe four I

Proctor & Gamble this afternoon.

We will most certainly stay on

accident, is just simply a tragedy.

The work, the schedule won't be

altered. It just means that those

of us that knew Molly will go about

our jobs with a heavy heart.

If you have something...or think

you have something you want to get

off your chest...

STEPHEN

What's say I do the talking and you

do the listening.

GOV. MORRIS

Okay.

STEPHEN

As of tomorrow morning there's

going to be some changes in your

campaign. Paul is out. I will be

your senior campaign manager. I'll

draft a statement, "we're at a

point in the campaign where some

changes have to be made etc." You

can put your own words in there,

you do it better than most.

GOV. MORRIS

And why would I do that?

STEPHEN

Because you want to win. Because

you broke the only rule in

politics. You want to be

President, you can start a war, you

can lie, you can cheat, you can

bankrupt the country, but you can't

fuck the interns...they'll get you

for that.

GOV. MORRIS

What do you think you have Stephen?

A troubled young girl tells you a

story.

STEPHEN

A troubled young pregnant girl...

GOV. MORRIS

Is that what she told you?

STEPHEN

...Who needed cash for an abortion.

What did you do, give her money?

Maybe she just wanted cash and you

were the perfect guy to hit up.

STEPHEN

Is that your best play?

GOV. MORRIS

You need a job that bad Stephen?

You walk in here with your dick in

your hand...you've got nothing.

STEPHEN

So how did I get here? You're

right Mike, there's nothing. No

phone messages, no text, no e-

mails, no photos or tapes, and yet

I'm standing right here.

GOV. MORRIS

Well go home.

STEPHEN

She left a note.

GOV. MORRIS

How would you know that?

STEPHEN

I cleaned up your mess. I took her

phone and I found her note.

GOV. MORRIS

I thought it was an accident.

THEN:

STEPHEN

You tell me, you were the last one

she called. Note says she was

pregnant, said you were going to

pay for her abortion...it also said

she didn't want to hurt you.

GOV. MORRIS

Then why would she leave a note

that could only do that?

(CONTINUED)

89.

CONTINUED: (3)

STEPHEN

Because she's twenty.

GOV. MORRIS

What do you want?

STEPHEN

Paul's gone today. I set a meeting

with you and Thompson where you

promise him the ticket. You get

three hundred and fifty-six pledged

delegates, you get North Carolina,

and then you take office and make

right what so many have made wrong.

All the things we both believe in.

GOV. MORRIS

Well I don't believe in

extortion...I don't believe in

tying myself to you for the next

eight years.

STEPHEN

Four years, let's not get ahead of

ourselves.

GOV. MORRIS

What were you doing in her room?

STEPHEN

Housekeeping, before you ended up

on page one.

GOV. MORRIS

No. You were already fired, you

were out. What were you doing in

her room?

STEPHEN

I was fixing a situation...I got a

call, someone from the hotel

thought I could help and called me.

GOV. MORRIS

You were off the campaign, but you

thought it was important to come

back and fix things? It was your

voice on the phone the other night.

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)

There's no note.

STEPHEN

Okay, there's no note.

GOV. MORRIS

Show it to me.

STEPHEN

You think I brought it here?

That's how people get hurt.

GOV. MORRIS

Okay let's play this out. You're

not wearing a wire because

everything you've suggested is

illegal...and you wouldn't fare

well in federal prison. You were

fucking her and she told you about

her situation. There are no

records or conversations between

us. And since she's had an

abortion, no DNA evidence. So if

there's no note, then it's your

word against mine. Your word. A

fired, disgruntled, employee, or a

sitting governor...There's no note.

It's your call Governor.

face on the campaign...Stephen is

very talented...very smart...

every mistake is magnified and she

was smart and pretty and so so

young.

JACK STEARNS (CONT'D)

plan, to not question his judgment,

with all due respect, I don't

accept this judgment. She made the

world better, not just for me, but

Senator Thompson I am honored to

stand here today with you. I am

humbled by your kind words, thank

you. Ladies and gentlemen, today

marks the beginning of a fight

between two sets of ideals. Either

we're going to move forward or were

going to live in the past...

Either we're going to lead the

world in technology, or we are

going to bury our heads in the

sand... the sands of Saudi

Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either

we're going to let greed and

corruption ruin our industries and

our shorelines or we are going to

take back our country! We are not a

nation used to coming in second or

third...

three hundred and fifty-six

delegates put the pledged delegates

out of reach. And with word today
