Based On The Novel By

1958

RIPLEY (O/S)

If I could just go back.  If I could rub

everything out.  Starting with myself.

Starting with borrowing a jacket.

FRAN (SINGS)

Ah, such fleeting paradise

such innocent delight

to love,

be loved,

a lullabye,

then silence.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

RIPLEY

Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(pointing at Ripley's borrowed

jacket)

I see you were at Princeton.

Then you'll most likely know our son,

Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

EMILY GREENLEAF

We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Yes.

EMILY GREENLEAF

Class of '56?

RIPLEY

(hesitating)

How is Dickie?

EMILY GREENLEAF

(to Fran)

I hope you'll come and see us...

FRAN

That's very kind.

EMILY GREENLEAF

Both of you...

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Of course, Dickie's idea of music is

Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz

is just noise, just an insolent noise.

RIPLEY

Gotta run. I'm so late.

(he hands Fran's boyfriend the

jacket he's been wearing)

Thanks for the jacket.

BOYFRIEND

Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

EMILY GREENLEAF

Darling couple, aren't they?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Yes.  An exceptional young man.

The interval

: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming

RIPLEY

Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.

Marge, his uh, the young lade is

supposedly writing some kind of book. God

knows what he does. By all accounts they

spend the whole time on the beach. Or his

sailboat. That's my son's talent,

spending his allowance.

HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)

Could you ever conceive of going to

Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?

(Ripley looks doubtful)

I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

RIPLEY

I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,

but...

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Good. Now you can go for a reason.

A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up

.  An exuberant and

Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

RIPLEY

Don't even know if this is a man or a

woman.

That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

CHAUFFEUR

Here.  I'll take that.

RIPLEY

Thanks.

CARETAKER

(nodding towards the apartment)

That thousand bucks should come in handy.

RIPLEY

Yes, sir.

CHAUFFEUR

(interupts Ripley, who is

about to open the car door)

I'll get that.

RIPLEY

Thanks.

CHAUFFEUR

(as he holds open the door for

Ripley)

Sir.

(Ripley laughs excitedly)

You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr

Greenleaf is personal friends with the

Cunard people.

CHAUFFEUR

I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens

a lot of doors.

Ripley. Ripley. Ripley!

he repeats in the hubbub

R

MEREDITH

What's your secret?

RIPLEY

Excuse me?

MEREDITH

No, it's just - you are American, aren't

you? - no, I just, I have so much

luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.

It's humiliating.

MEREDITH (cont'd)

I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith

Randall.

RIPLEY

Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

MEREDITH

Hello.

MEREDITH (cont'd)

You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

RIPLEY

(thinking quickly)

Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

MEREDITH

So now, did they put your suitcase in the

wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -

weren't you under the

R

stand? I thought

I saw you there.

RIPLEY

My father wants me in New York. He builds

boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel

under my mother's name.

MEREDITH

Which is?

RIPLEY

Emily.

(Meredith's bewildered)

Just kidding.

MEREDITH

The funny thing is, I'm not Randall

either. I'm Logue.

RIPLEY

(nods, recognizing the name)

As in the...?

MEREDITH

As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug

off the dress. I travel under my mother's

name, too.

RIPLEY

Randall.

MEREDITH

Right.

Buses, Taxis and exits

- the

Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO

.  They're going in

MEREDITH (cont'd)

(offering her hand)

So - partners in disguise.

(looks at the signs)

Bye.

DRIVER

MONGIBELLO!

RIPLEY

(looking at a long, lean girl

about to dive)

La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancEe

has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Questo e la mia faccia.....

RIPLEY (cont'd)

This is my face.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la

faccia di Dickie.

RIPLEY

Dickie Greenleaf?

DICKIE

Who's this?

RIPLEY

It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at

Princeton together.

DICKIE

Okay.

(he sits up)

And did we know each other?

RIPLEY

Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must

have known me.

DICKIE

(to Marge)

Princeton is like a fog, America's like a

fog.

(to Ripley)

This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what

was it?

RIPLEY

Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

MARGE

How do you do.

DICKIE

What are you doing in Mongi?

RIPLEY

Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

DICKIE

(finds this idea absurd)

Passing through! You're so white. Did you

ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,

actually.

RIPLEY

It's just an undercoat.

(Marge laughs)

DICKIE

Say again?

RIPLEY

You know, a primer.

DICKIE

That's funny.

MARGE

You should come and have lunch with us,

before you go - Dickie?

DICKIE

Sure.  Any time.

MARGE

And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in

danger of turning a little pink.

RIPLEY

Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

DICKIE

I've been looking for you everywhere.

SILVANA

Ah, today you're looking for me.  And

where have you been the rest of the week?

Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate

you, you know?

DICKIE

What?

SILVANA

I hate you.

DICKIE

Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,

I'm a swine.

MARGE

Did you forget where I live? It's four

o'clock.

DICKIE

I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

MARGE

You just woke up!

DICKIE

Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we

were fishing, and then it was dawn and

we'd caught absolutely nothing.

MARGE

Well, we ate everything without you.

DICKIE

We?

MARGE

Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

DICKIE

Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We

thought you'd disappeared. We were going

to send out a search party.

RIPLEY

No, still here.

MARGE

Tom was telling me about his trip over.

Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

DICKIE

Is that good?

MARGE

Shut up!

RIPLEY

I'm intruding.

DICKIE

Can you mix a martini?

RIPLEY

(hesitant)

Sure.

MARGE

(going inside)

I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

DICKIE

Everybody should have one talent.

(to Ripley)

What's yours?

RIPLEY

(without a beat)

Forging signatures. Telling lies.

Impersonating practically anybody.

DICKIE

(enjoying this banter)

That's three. Nobody should have more

than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

RIPLEY

Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -

(his voice ages, his face

changes)

The only talent my son has is for cashing

his allowance.

DICKIE

(absolutely thrown)

What? What's this?

RIPLEY

I like to sail, believe me, I love to

sail! Instead I make boats and other

people sail them.

DICKIE

(incredibly impressed)

Stop! It's too much!  You're making all

the hairs on my neck stand up!

RIPLEY

(relishing it)

Jazz, let's face it, it's just an

insolent noise.

DICKIE

I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the

old bastard is here right now!  That's

brilliant!  How do you know him?

RIPLEY

I met him in New York.

DICKIE

Marge! You've got to hear this!

MARGE

(returning with the drinks)

What?  What?

DICKIE

Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf

1st.

RIPLEY

Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a

fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

MARGE

What's going on?

DICKIE

Uncanny!

MARGE

I don't get it.

RIPLEY

Could you ever conceive of going there,

Tom, and bringing him back?

DICKIE

What?

RIPLEY

I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and

persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you

$1000.

Passeggiata

in Sunday best. Girls arm

DICKIE

I'm never going back. To actually hire

somebody to come all the way here to drag

me back home - got to be insane, hasn't

he?

DICKIE (cont'd)

I'm never going back!

RIPLEY

No, I think your mother, her illness -

DICKIE

It's got nothing to do with my mother!

She's had leukemia for - ! This is what

makes me boil about him! HE wants me

back! - it's got nothing to do with my

mother.

RIPLEY

I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling

you what I -

DICKIE

(interrupting)

Go back!  Go back to New York or call him

if you can find a telephone that works,

and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me

back to him or his shipyard.

MARGE

Hi Tom.

DICKIE

(looks up)

Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

MARGE

I'll come down.

DICKIE

(to Ripley)

Did you speak to my father?

RIPLEY

You were right about the telephones.

There are no lines, there's some problem.

MARGE

(coming out of the front door)

Hello Tom. You're off? What are your

plans?

RIPLEY

Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

DICKIE

You like jazz!

RIPLEY

(gathering up the records)

I

love

jazz.

DICKIE

(holding up a Chet Baker)

This is the best. Marge says she likes

jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is

jazz.

MARGE

I never said that!

RIPLEY

Bird. That's jazz.

DICKIE

Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

RIPLEY

I don't know. What's the name of your

sailboat?

DICKIE

Bird!

MARGE

Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,

everyone knows you can't call a boat

after a man.

RIPLEY

He's not a man, he's a god.

DICKIE

(excited)

Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a

club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

MARGE

It's vile.

DICKIE

Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't

have to come.

(to Ripley)

It's great.  You're going to love it.

MOANIN'

. Dickie and Ripley arrive and

Tu

- a hit which reflects the current craze

FAUSTO

(improvising in Italian)

Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,

all the way from America... etc.

FAUSTO (cont'd)

And a big round of applause for a new

friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

DICKIE (O/S)

(reading)

I have bumped into an old friend from

Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.

He says he's going to haunt me until I

agree to come back to New York with

him...

DICKIE

(grins)

Good afternoon!

RIPLEY

What time is it?

(puts on his glasses and checks

his watch)

Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?

(points at the letter)

That should be two

T

s.

DICKIE

I can't write and I can't spell.  That's

the privilege of a first-class education.

You're upstairs at the back. I think

Ermelinda made the bed up.

RIPLEY

This is so good of you.

DICKIE

Don't say it again. Now you're a Double

Agent and we're going to string my Dad

alone, I was thinking we might buy a

little car with the expense money he's

sending you. What do you think, Marge...a

little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

MARGE

Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,

what we need urgently is an icebox. What

do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll

be your friend for life.

RIPLEY

I absolutely agree with Marge.

DICKIE

It'll just be for a little while.  He can

be... he makes me laugh.

MARGE

Okay, darling.

DICKIE

You'd say if you mind?

MARGE

No, I like him.

DICKIE

Marge, you like everybody.

MARGE

I don't like you.

DICKIE

Then I'll go to your place and you can

move in with Tom.

No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,

DICKIE

Now you know why Miss Sherwood always

shows up for breakfast.  It's not love

it's the coffee machine.

MARGE

It's the one task Dickie can do on his

own - make coffee.

DICKIE

Shut up.

MARGE

Oh darling - is that for me?

DICKIE

No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

RIPLEY

(as Dickie hands him his cup)

That ring's so great. The green one.

MARGE

(delighted)

Tom, I love you!

(to Dickie)

See!

(to Ripley)

I bought it for him, for his birthday.

RIPLEY

It's superb.

DICKIE

I had to promise, capital P, never to

take it off - otherwise I'd give it to

you.

MARGE

(flicking a crumb at him)

Bastard!

(to Ripley)

Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in

Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

DICKIE

I hope it wasn't cheap.

MARGE

Oh, it was.

RIPLEY

(to Marge)

I have to find a birthday present for

Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

MARGE

Frances?

RIPLEY

My fiancEe.

DICKIE

You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

RIPLEY

Your parents met her.

DICKIE

Oh God - I can just imagine -

if only

Dickie would settle down... doesn't every

parent deserve a grandchild?

Never! I

swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never

going back.

RIPLEY

I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

DICKIE

You're doing great. We'll make a sailor

of you yet. You're doing really well.

MARGE

Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing

Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

DICKIE

Yes please!

RIPLEY

Could we sail to Venice?

DICKIE

Sure.  I love Venice.

RIPLEY

I have to go to Venice.

DICKIE

See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or

is it Rome? You do something and die,

don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

RIPLEY

And Rome.

DICKIE

Do you ski?

(Ripley frowns)

Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!

That's the next thing to deal with. We're

planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.

Excellent skiing. Excellent.

(as Marge reappears)

Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to

teach him that, too. Have you ever known

such low class?

MARGE

Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting

married. We might have to invite him on

our honeymoon.

MARGE

Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue

crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my

book, and I was always going to this cafe

with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to

play his saxophone outside and I would

see him and he would see me, and he would

play

My Funny Valentine.

It was only

later that I realised he only knows about

six songs.

MARGE (cont'd)

(to Silvana, in Italian)

Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e

pane, e del prosciutto.

SILVANA

E fichi?  Come sempre?

MARGE

Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

MARGE (cont'd)

(back to Ripley)

Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see

Dickie, he starts playing

My Funny

Valentine,

and then all of a sudden he

just walks into the cafe, right in front

of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had

never spoken to him in my life - he said

I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want

you to come with me.

So I did.

MARGE (cont'd)

If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom

and I are running off together.

DICKIE

Okay.

SILVANA

Did you get my message?  I want to talk

to you.

DICKIE

I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

DICKIE

You're breaking my ribs!

RIPLEY

What?

DICKIE

You're breaking my ribs!

My Funny

in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is

DICKIE

I could fuck this icebox I love it so

much.

(considering Ripley)

What were you actually doing in New York?

RIPLEY

I played piano in a few places.

DICKIE

That's one job, you told me a lot of

jobs.

RIPLEY

A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,

I don't want to think about New York.

DICKIE

The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I

spend hours speculating.

(drinking)

Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

RIPLEY

Copy out from here...

DICKIE

(staring to write on the back

of a postcard)

I love the fact you brought Shakespeare

with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says

you wash the same shirt out every night.

Is that true?

RIPLEY

No! I've got more than one shirt!

DICKIE

She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,

just wear some of my things, wear

anything you want, most of it's ancient.

(he's finished writing)

RIPLEY

Now your signature.

(watching him write)

Not "Dickie". Your signature.

DICKIE

Without the glasses you're not even ugly.

(takes them, tries them on)

I don't need them because I never read.

How do I look.

RIPLEY

Like Clark Kent.

(takes them back, puts them on

beaming at Dickie)

Now Superman.

DICKIE

I know. I write like a child.

RIPLEY

Pretty vile. See this: The

S

and the

T

,

do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's

pain, that's secret pain.

DICKIE

It must be a deep secret, cause I don't

know about it.

RIPLEY

Your handwriting - nothing more naked.

See - nothing's quite touching the line -

that's vanity.

DICKIE

(flattered)

Well we certainly know that's true.

DICKIE

Do you have any brothers?

RIPLEY

No, no brothers, no sisters.

DICKIE

me neither. Nor does Marge. All only

children - what does that mean?

RIPLEY

Means we never shared a bath.

I'm cold. Can I get in?

DICKIE

No!

RIPLEY

I didn't mean with you in it.

DICKIE

(standing)

Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune

anyway.

DICKIE

It is me. It's an old picture.

(sighs at Ripley)

Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look

like you'.

CLERK

Letters -

Greenleaf,

and for

Ripley.

RIPLEY

Fran.

(anticipating her letter)

I miss you, where are you coming home?

Stop telling me what a great time you're

having, how you love Dickie... and Marge

and...

(the next letter)

And this one, I think, is your dad...

DICKIE

What does he say?

RIPLEY

He's getting impatient. He wants me to

reassure him you'll be home by

Thanksgiving.

DICKIE

You've got to get a new jacket. Really.

You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm

sick of seeing you in them.

RIPLEY

I can't. I can't keep spending your

father's money.

DICKIE

I love how responsible you are. My Dad

should make you Chief Accountant or

something.  Let me buy you a jacket.

There's a great place when we get to

Rome, Batistoni.

DICKIE (cont'd)

Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to

Roma!

RIPLEY

Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,

or can we hire any of them - ?

DICKIE

Relax.

RIPLEY

It's just there's so much to do in a

single day.

DICKIE

Relax. The most important question is

where to eat. I hope Freddie made a

reservation.

RIPLEY

Freddie?

DICKIE

Freddie Miles.  You know - he's

organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

DICKIE (cont'd)

Frederico!

FREDDIE

Ciao bello.

(noticing a beautiful woman in

an open-topped car)

Don't you want to fuck every woman you

see.  Just once.

DICKIE

This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

FREDDIE

(mugging)

Hey, if I'm late, think what her

husband's saying!

FREDDIE (cont'd)

So let's go. I got us a table outside at

Fabrizio's.

DICKIE

I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with

Mongi.

FREDDIE

I know.  I was there.

(looks back to see Ripley

struggling to settle the

check)

Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.

Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

FREDDIE (cont'd)

You're going to have to sit between us.

But don't put your shoes on the seat,

know what I mean, put them one on top of

the other.  Okay?

DICKIE

Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and

meet some friends of Freddie's. The best

thing is - if you want to be a tourist -

grab a cab and we can meet up at the

railway station.

RIPLEY

(absolutely crestfallen)

What club?

DICKIE

Freddie's arranged it with some of the

skiing crowd. Come if you want but I

thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

RIPLEY

I did. And then maybe get the jacket and

what have you...

FREDDIE

(from inside the booth)

Dick - you've got to hear this!

DICKIE

(oblivious to Ripley's pain)

Listen, just take one of mine when we get

back. Don't worry about it.  I did the

Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is

enough in anyone's life.

DICKIE

Ciao.  Have fun.

RIPLEY

You said to make sure you didn't miss the

train. It leaves at eight.

DICKIE (O/S)

What are you doing?

RIPLEY

Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.

(pause)

I didn't think you were coming back.

DICKIE

I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

DICKIE (cont'd)

Shoes too?

RIPLEY

(lame, ashamed)

You said I could pick out a jacket and I

just... Sorry.

DICKIE

Get undressed in your own room, would

you?

RIPLEY

I thought you'd missed the train.

DICKIE

Freddie drove me back in his car.

RIPLEY

(horrified)

Is Freddie here?

DICKIE

He's downstairs.

RIPLEY

I was just fooling around. Don't say

anything. Sorry.

MARGE

Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

FREDDIE

I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was

just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in

Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear

his clothes, and his father picks up the

tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll

do it!

MARGE

You really should go in, it's marvellous.

RIPLEY

I'm fine.

MARGE

Are you okay?

RIPLEY

Sure.

MARGE

The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun

shines on you and it's glorious, then he

forgets you and it's very very cold.

RIPLEY

So I'm learning.

MARGE

He's not even aware of it. When you've

got his attention you feel like you're

the only person in the world. That's why

everybody loves him. Other times...

DICKIE

(laughing and choking)

He's drowning me!

MARGE

It's always the same whenever someone new

comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,

Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -

did you meet him, he's a musician? -

... and especially you, of course... and

that's only the boys.

MARGE (cont'd)

Tell me, why is it when men play they

always play at killing each other...?

I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

RIPLEY

What about Cortina?

MARGE

Didn't Dick say? - he talked to

Freddie... apparently it's not going to

work out -

(Ripley's devastated, Marge

notices, can't look at him)

Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

DICKIE

Come on, Frederico, do you really have

to go back?  At least stick around for

the Festival of the Madonna.

FREDDIE

I don't think so. Come back with me to

Rome. There's this great new club.  Have

some drinks, lotta ladies...

DICKIE

Do you think you can steer this thing?

FREDDIE

Sure.

DICKIE

Just point her at Capri and avoid the

rocks.

FREDDIE

What are you doing?

DICKIE

Marge-maintenance.

FREDDIE

Aye, aye.

FREDDIE (cont'd)

Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,

you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

RIPLEY

What's the fight about? That's her

fiancE, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

DICKIE

(sharp)

I don't know! Why are you asking me?

(agitated)

How can it take an hour to find an

ambulance?

MARGE

(conciliatory)

Well, she was already dead, darling,

wasn't she, so I suppose -

DICKIE

I don't know why people say this

country's civilised. It isn't. It's

fucking primitive.

MARGE

Dickie!

RIPLEY

I'll go and see what's the matter.

MARGE

I'll go.

RIPLEY

I know why you're upset.

(Dickie continues playing)

I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you

and Silvana.

DICKIE

What about us?

DICKIE (cont'd)

(losing his temper)

You don't have to clean up! Really!

DICKIE (cont'd)

(as Ripley returns)

She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do

you know what that means in a place like

this?

RIPLEY

I'm prepared to take the blame.

DICKIE

What are you talking about?

RIPLEY

You've been so good to me. You're the

brother I never had. I'm the brother you

never had.

DICKIE

She came to me for help, she needed

money, and I didn't help her. I didn't

help her. Now she's dead and it's my

fault.

RIPLEY

I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,

or anybody, the police - It's a secret

between us and I'll keep it.

RIPLEY (O/S)

Dear Tom, I think the time has come to

discontinue your expense checks...

RIPLEY

...The thousand dollars, of course, was

only due in the event that you succeeded

in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I

hope the trip has afforded you some

pleasure despite the failure of its main

objective you need no longer consider

yourself obligated to us in any way...

DICKIE

You can't blame him.  You could hardly

expect this to go on forever.

RIPLEY

I thought you might write again. Now that

we're brothers...

DICKIE

I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've

had a good run, haven't we?

RIPLEY

(increasingly miserable)

What about Venice? Can we stick to that

plan at least?

DICKIE

I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on

here without money.  It's time we all

moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.

Especially now with everything - I really

want to move to the North. I need to

check out San Remo next week, find

somewhere new to keep the boat.

But it would be great, though, if you

came with me.  Our last trip before you

leave. There's a jazz festival - we could

say goodbye in style.  What do you think?

A last trip?

Ripley lays his head on Dickie's

, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces

DICKIE

(terse)

Why do you do that thing - with your

neck? On trains you always do that thing,

it's so spooky.

DICKIE

This is more like it. Didn't I tell you

San Remo was crazy!

RIPLEY

To Mongibello and the happiest days of my

life.

DICKIE

To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

RIPLEY

I'm suddenly quite happy to be going

back.

DICKIE

That's good.

RIPLEY

I've got plans!

DICKIE

Ripley's plans.

RIPLEY

Esatto. I'm always planning.

DICKIE

Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I

didn't, did I?

RIPLEY

Why are you asking all of a sudden?

DICKIE

No reason. Because you're leaving, I

guess. I don't think you were there, were

you?

RIPLEY

Why?

DICKIE

I mean it as a compliment. You've got

such great taste, I don't know. Most of

the thugs at Princeton had tasted

everything and had no taste. Used to say,

the cream of America: rich and thick.

Freddie's the perfect example.

RIPLEY

Then I'll take it as a compliment.

DICKIE

I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

RIPLEY

(a beat)

Ha.

DICKIE

Do you even like jazz - or was that

something for my benefit?

RIPLEY

(conceding, without guile)

I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to

like everything about the way you live.

It's one big love affair. If you knew my

life back home in New York...

DICKIE

I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what

do you think about drums?

RIPLEY

What?

DICKIE

So cool.

DICKIE

That's how I found my place in Mongi.

Took a boat out round the bay.  The first

place I liked, I got it.

RIPLEY

Dickie, slow down, come on!

DICKIE

(ecstatic)

I love it here! Gonna live here!

RIPLEY

I wanted to tell you my plan.

DICKIE

So tell me.

RIPLEY

I thought I might come back. In the New

Year. Under my own steam.

DICKIE

(suddenly tight)

Really?  To Italy?

RIPLEY

Of course. Let's say, for argument's

sake, you were here - perhaps we could

split the rent on a house - I'll get a

job - or, better still, I could get a

place in Rome and when we're there we

could be there and if we're here we could

be here -

DICKIE

Oh God, I don't think so.

RIPLEY

- you see, particularly with the Marge

problem, you can just blame me.

DICKIE

Marge and I are getting married.

RIPLEY

(appalled)

How?

DICKIE

How?

RIPLEY

Yesterday you're ogling girls on the

terrace, today you're getting married.

It's absurd.

DICKIE

I love Marge.

RIPLEY

You love me and you're not marrying me.

DICKIE

(cold)

Tom, I don't love you.

RIPLEY

No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained

all of that.

DICKIE

I'm actually a little relieved you're

going, to be honest. I think we've seen

enough of each other for a while.

RIPLEY

What?

DICKIE

You can be a leech - you know this - and

it's boring. You can be quite boring.

RIPLEY

(volcanic)

The funny thing -

I'm

not pretending to

be somebody else and

you

are. I'm

absolutely honest with you. I've told you

my feelings. But you, first of all I know

there's something - that evening when we

played chess, for instance, it was

obvious -

DICKIE

(incredulous)

What evening?

RIPLEY

Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for

you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,

fine, then you do this sordid thing with

Marge, fucking her on the boat while we

all have to listen, which was

excruciating, frankly, plus you follow

your cock around like a - and now you're

getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive

me...you're lying to Marge then getting

married to her, you're knocking up

Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've

got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,

what do you really play?

DICKIE

(attacking him, administering

tiny slaps as punctuation to

his tirade)

Who are you - some imposter, some third

class mooch - who are you to tell me

anything? Actually, I really really

really don't want to be on this boat with

you, I can't move without you moving,

which is exactly how it feels and it

gives me the creeps.

(he goes to rev up the engine)

I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,

Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give

me the -

RIPLEY

Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

DICKIE

For God's sake.

DICKIE (cont'd)

I'll kill you!

RIPLEY

Can I have my key, please?

RECEPTIONIST

(at the key rack)

Of course - But you must be very cold?

Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

RIPLEY

(mind racing)

No, it's - I'm...

C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear

... Ripley

RIPLEY

Hello Marge.

MARGE

Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

RIPLEY

How are you? Sorry. Is your book going

well?

MARGE

Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

RIPLEY

I was just looking at you -

(looking at her tenderly)

- so quiet.

MARGE

Where's Dickie?

RIPLEY

I think he's planning on staying in Rome

for a few days.

MARGE

(looks at him)

Ha. Did he say why?

RIPLEY

I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,

Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

MARGE

What does that mean?

RIPLEY

Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the

next day I'm not, one day we're all one

family, the next day he wants to be

alone. You tell me.

MARGE

Is that what he said - he wanted to be

alone?

RIPLEY

He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked

me to deliver this.

MARGE

Thanks. he knows I love this, although

why it couldn't have waited...

RIPLEY

Errand number one - deliver Marge's

perfume. Errand number two, pack some

clothes and his precious saxophone.

MARGE

(alarmed)

How long's he staying for?

RIPLEY

Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

MARGE

There was a letter from Dickie in with my

perfume. You realize it's more than a few

days? He's thinking of

moving

to Rome.

MARGE (cont'd)

The thing is, the night before he left,

we talked about moving, together, going

North - and I suppose I put some pressure

on him, about getting married, I just

might have scared him off. There's a side

to him, when our heads are on the pillow,

I know no-one else sees it, which is

really tender.

(unravelling)

I think I should come with you to Rome

and just confront him.

MARGE (cont'd)

He hates being confronted.

RIPLEY

I think you're right.

ALDO

Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

RIPLEY

(walking away)

Thank you.

RIPLEY

Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel

Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor

Thomas Ripley - No

R

ipley, R, yes.

Grazie.

H R

.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing

Stars, hide your fires

handwriting

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd

like to leave a message. Yes. Please call

Dickie -

Dickie Greenleaf

- at the Grand.

RIPLEY

He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a

message -

Got your call. Dinner tonight

sounds fine. Ripley

.

(listens as it's read back)

Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank

you.

RIPLEY

I'd like these to have my initials -

embossed, I don't know the word in

Italian ...embossed?

GUCCI ASSISTANT

Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

MEREDITH

(entering the shop)

Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

MEREDITH

But you're going skiing with us Yankees,

aren't you?

RIPLEY

What?

MEREDITH

At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie

Miles and -

RIPLEY

(interrupting, astonished)

How did you know that?

MEREDITH

Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

RIPLEY

(unsettled)

Is Freddie in Rome?

MEREDITH

Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,

of course, and we've chatted and I know

about you and Marge and Mongi and what an

unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you

were a rat and I thought to myself now I

know why he travels under R.

RIPLEY

I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So

the rat's here now, in Rome.

MEREDITH

Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

RIPLEY

Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.

I feel like I've been handed a new life.

MEREDITH

The truth is if you've had money your

entire life, even if you despise it,

which we do - agreed? - you're only truly

comfortable around other people who have

it and despise it.

RIPLEY

I know.

MEREDITH

I've never admitted that to anyone.

RIPLEY

I don't want too many large bills. Nobody

will change them.

MEREDITH

Show me the other one again.

(the Tailor obliges)

I like them both.

RIPLEY

I'll take them both.

MEREDITH (O/S)

I know you're a jazz fiend but do you

absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been

trying to give my tickets away, it's

tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be

dragged...

RIPLEY

(emerging)

You could drag me.

On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria

RIPLEY

Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

JOAN

Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend

of Freddie's - he has

I hate Opera

tattooed on his chest.

RIPLEY

There's room for a whole libretto on

Freddie's chest.

JOAN

(laughs)

I'm sure we've met.

JOAN (cont'd)

I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?

This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

RIPLEY

Thanks, yes, I think we did.

JOAN

One minute you people are children and

the next you're getting tattooed.

suddenly MARGE is

MARGE

(as if she's seen a ghost)

Oh my God. Tom.

RIPLEY

Marge, how are you? What are you doing in

Rome?

MARGE

Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

RIPLEY

No.

(to Smith-Kingsley)

Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

PETER

Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about

you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

MARGE

(works out what's strange)

No glasses.

RIPLEY

(to Peter)

Ditto.

PETER

Where are you hiding him? He's

impossible, isn't he?

MARGE

Is he really not here?

RIPLEY

Marge, you know Dickie has

I hate Opera

tattooed on his chest.

MARGE

You were going to Venice.

PETER

Yes, what happened? I heard you were

desperate to come. I was looking forward

to rowing you around.

RIPLEY

I am.  I really am. And I've been

travelling. I just can't seem to get that

far north.

PETER

Well hurry, before we sink.

(reaches into his jacket)

Should I give you my telephone number in

Venice?

RIPLEY

Thanks.

PETER

Look there's Meredith thingy - who's

that, Marge? - they're in textiles...

Meredith -

(embarrassed at not

remembering)

God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in

her house...!

MARGE

I don't know her.

(to Ripley)

He hasn't called, he's hardly written,

just these cryptic notes. You don't just

dump people.

PETER

Will we see you later?

RIPLEY

I can't later.

PETER

And tomorrow?

RIPLEY

Tomorrow's possible. Do you know

Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

PETER

I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

RIPLEY

Ten thirty?

PETER

We'll be there.

RIPLEY

Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.

(to Peter)

It's really good to meet you.

RIPLEY

Let's go.

MEREDITH

I thought you were enjoying yourself?

RIPLEY

Let's take a Carozza and look at the

moon.

MEREDITH

You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

RIPLEY

C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the

two of us.

MEREDITH

(quite taken)

Okay then, you're crazy.

MEREDITH

Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

RIPLEY

You're such a pal to understand. It's as

if Marge is here now - I look at you and

I see her face - and I can't, whatever

I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

MEREDITH

No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

RIPLEY

Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

MEREDITH

Beating you away.

MEREDITH

Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say

goodbye in the daylight, properly? So

it's not just this, it's too...you should

always save pain for daylight...

RIPLEY

Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll

meet you. Let's have coffee in the

morning at Dinelli's.

MEREDITH

(fluttering)

I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

RIPLEY

Exactly. 10.30 -

(instantly correcting himself)

10.15.

Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,

she drinks her coffee at an

MEREDITH

Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

PETER

Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm

sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is

Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

MARGE

Hello.

PETER

Join us, won't you? We're just waiting

for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did

we see you at the Opera last night?

MEREDITH

I won't actually, although I think this

might - are you waiting for Dickie?

PETER

Well no, as it happens, although...

MARGE

(stunned at the mention of his

name)

Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

MEREDITH

You were at the Opera? Well, that

explains - yes I was there. I was there

with Dickie.

MARGE

(to Peter)

I told you! I knew it!

MEREDITH

(moving over to them)

Marge, I don't know you, so I have no

right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I

think you'll find he's coming home to

you.

MARGE

(proprietorial)

How would you know that?

MEREDITH

He told me everything. I was supposed to

meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm

going to go now, I think. Unless he meant

us

to meet - which would be a little

cruel, wouldn't it?

PETER

No, we're meeting another friend. Tom

Ripley.

MARGE

Do you know Tom?

MEREDITH

Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,

but no, I didn't meet him.

MEREDITH (cont'd)

Not for me. No, grazie.

MEREDITH (cont'd)

I hope I didn't complicate matters, but

nothing, nothing untoward happened,

nothing to prevent you from welcoming him

back, from marrying him...Goodbye.

Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

RIPLEY

Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.

Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp

when they can make you line up for three.

Have you been waiting long?

PETER

Not at all. Morning Tom.

RIPLEY

Hi.

(to Marge)

Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've

seen a ghost...

MARGE

Dickie was at the Opera last night.

RIPLEY

I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't

drag Dickie to -

MARGE

He was there with someone. So I suppose

she must have dragged him - that's not

fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think

Dickie's coming home.

(to Peter)

I'm going to go home.

RIPLEY

Really? That's swell. No, I was just -

you're way ahead of me! Great!

PETER

We think he's had a change of heart.

(to Marge)

So we should be celebrating.

MARGE

I hope so.

PETER

(to Marge)

That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith

said -

(to Ripley)

Meredith's the American girl I saw last

night, I know her, at the Opera, she's

been seeing something of Dickie -

RIPLEY

My God.

PETER

But the point is Dickie - well we know

this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses

her and apparently he's come to his

senses...

RIPLEY

It's fantastic.

(to Peter)

I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand

this, but anytime Dickie does something I

feel guilty.

SIGNORA BUFFI

Accendo il riscaldamento.

(I'll turn the heating on.)

RIPLEY

(mimes playing sax)

Mi piace suonare.

(I like to play music.)

SIGNORA BUFFI

(shrugs)

Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una

coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?

(I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,

do you like it?)

RIPLEY

Hello?

FREDDIE (O/S)

Dickie?

RIPLEY

Who is it?

FREDDIE (O/S)

It's Freddie. Let me in.

FREDDIE (O/S)

Dickie, come on, it's me.

RIPLEY

Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

FREDDIE

(confused, not pleasantly)

Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

RIPLEY

Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at

dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

FREDDIE

I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.

If you said he was still at lunch I'd

believe you. Incredible. The guy has

disappeared off the face of the earth.

RIPLEY

I guess.

FREDDIE

The landlady - as far as I could tell,

the landlady said he was here right now.

RIPLEY

He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I

can't think why you would imagine Dickie

would hide from you.

FREDDIE

Because he's

been

hiding from me - what

happened at Christmas?

RIPLEY

What about Christmas?

FREDDIE

He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't

get a cable or a call or a note or,

frankly, a fart.

RIPLEY (O/S)

Of course, he's been very involved in his

music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,

you know, you have to go into a cocoon

before you can become a butterfly.

FREDDIE

Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him

play that thing?

(gesturing at the sax on its

stand)

He can't.

RIPLEY (O/S)

(casually)

How did you find him? It's such an out of

the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

FREDDIE

No thanks.

(explaining his detective work)

Some kid at the American Express Office.

(he starts to explore)

Are you living here?

RIPLEY

(returning, flinching)

No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,

in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

FREDDIE (O/S)

Did this place come furnished? It doesn't

look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so

bourgeois.

RIPLEY

You should watch that!

FREDDIE

In fact the only thing which looks like

Dickie is you.

RIPLEY

Hardly.

FREDDIE

Have you done something to your hair?

RIPLEY

Freddie, do you have something to say?

FREDDIE

What? I think I'm saying it. Something's

going on. He's either converted to

Christianity - or to something else.

RIPLEY

I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.

Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the

Corso.

FREDDIE

Is it on

"delle Croce, just off the

Corso"

? You're a quick study, aren't you?

Last time you didn't know your ass from

your elbow, now you're giving me

directions. That's not fair, you probably

do know your ass from your elbow. I'll

see you.

Signor Greenleaf

and

Signor Ripley

. Ripley hurries inside as

FREDDIE

Ripley? There's someth -

RIPLEY

(mimicking Freddie's voice)

Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her

husband's saying.

ROVERINI

Dickie Greenleaf?

RIPLEY

Yes?

ROVERINI

Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

ROVERINI

It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did

Signor Miles leave yesterday?

RIPLEY

I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd

both taken on far too many drinks - but

it was dark, it was certainly dark when I

walked him down to his car.

ROVERINI

So Signor Miles drove away and you did

what?

RIPLEY

I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but

I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.

I've suffered all day. Who found him?

ROVERINI

Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in

Rome.

RIPLEY

Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

ROVERINI

So, the Doctor, he has to make the -

(looks at Baggio)

- come se dice?

RIPLEY

Postmortem?

ROVERINI

Yes, exactly, but his first, his first

conclusion was that Signor Miles was

killed not later than seven o'clock

yesterday evening.

RIPLEY

Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he

drove off in his car.

ROVERINI

No.

MARGE

Did he kill Freddie?

RIPLEY

Marge, when did you get here?

MARGE

Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

RIPLEY

I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

MARGE

I tried again, waiting here, watching for

him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look

for Dickie I find you.

(focusing on Ripley's cuts and

bruises)

What happened to your face?

RIPLEY

Dickie did it.

MARGE

(suddenly tense)

Dickie?

RIPLEY

My face! There was an argument. I said

some things I shouldn't have.  About you.

About the appalling way he's treating

you, all of us.  And the next thing I

know he's launched himself at me.

(he pulls the scooter off the

stand)

Are you getting on?

MARGE

What?

RIPLEY

Get on. I'll take you to him.

MARGE

Where does Dickie live?

RIPLEY

We passed it a few blocks back, where the

police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They

don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not

going to incriminate Dickie -

MARGE

Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

RIPLEY

(thinking hard, distracted)

No, well go if you want to, but don't

talk to the Police about my face - they

find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he

could've hit Freddie.

(sincerely)

Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you

later.

RIPLEY

Can we go up? Do you mind?

ROVERINI

Of course. What happened to your face?

RIPLEY

My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by

photographers.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

(agitated)

The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm

feeling hounded - do you think you could

not give out my address?

ROVERINI

Never. We've had many requests and, of

course, we say no - even to your fiancEe.

RIPLEY

I really don't want to see anybody.

ROVERINI

Even your fiancEe...?

RIPLEY

Even her.

ROVERINI

What about Thomas Ripley?

RIPLEY

What about Ripley?

ROVERINI

You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,

is that right?

RIPLEY

Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That

was months ago.

ROVERINI

November, I thought.

RIPLEY

Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

ROVERINI

November 7th is my information.

RIPLEY

I don't remember the exact date.

ROVERINI

And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

RIPLEY

A few days ago.

ROVERINI

Does he stay with you here?

RIPLEY

No!

ROVERINI

No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago

Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your

apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a

little boat is found in San Remo full of

rocks, and the owner tells the Police it

was stolen on November 7th. We look at

hotel records and we see

oh! Dickie

Greenleaf is staying in San Remo

and then

our boatman remembers two Americans

taking a boat.

RIPLEY

It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.

There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,

there must have been a hundred people

renting a boat on that day.

ROVERINI

31 people.

RIPLEY

31 people.

ROVERINI

That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge

Sherwood.

RIPLEY

(appalled, defeated)

Let her in, what's the difference?  Let

her in.

(Baggio is on his way to the

door.)

No, actually, no, I'd like it very much

if you would ask her to come back later.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Thank you.

ROVERINI

(watching him)

May I ask...why would you speak to your

friend and not your fiancEe?

RIPLEY

I think I just said. Ripley was handling

some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley

want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me

every day if I would marry him. And when.

ROVERINI

Do you have a photograph of Signor

Ripley?

RIPLEY

I'm not in the habit of carrying around

photographs of my male friends.

ROVERINI

Now I think I have upset you. My English

perhaps is coarse.

RIPLEY

It is a little coarse, yes.

ROVERINI

Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley

since San -

RIPLEY

I have!

ROVERINI

You have, yes.

RIPLEY

No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask

her! and if I could remember which hotel

he was staying at -

the Goldoni!

- Tom

was staying at the Goldoni.

ROVERINI

Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A

coincidence.

(he gets up to leave)

I look forward to our next meeting when I

will be more careful with my English and

persuade you to play me your saxophone.

Alto.

RIPLEY

Absolutely.

ROVERINI

(suddenly turning)

I have a witness who thinks they saw two

men getting into Mr Miles' car. She

wants to identify you in a -

confronto

-

line-up.

(ominously)

Tomorrow then?

RIPLEY

(thrown, scrabbling)

Tomorrow.

ROVERINI (O/S)

Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I

really don't think he wants to see

anyone.

MARGE

Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.

What am I doing, chasing you around...?

I was going to say I would count to three

and if you didn't open the door, but I

won't count any more. On you. I won't

count on you any more. Whatever it is,

whatever you've done or haven't done,

you've broken my heart. That's one thing

I know you're guilty of, and I don't know

why, I don't know why, I just don't know

why...

RIPLEY (O/S)

My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.

Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought

about going to the police, but I can't do

it, I can't face it.  I can't face

anything anymore...

scratch at the photograph

, obliterating the face.

RIPLEY (O/S)

...I wish I could give you the life I

took for granted. You've always

understood what's at the heart of me,

Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's

why I'm writing this to you, the brother

I never had. The only true friend I ever

had. In all kinds of ways you're much

more like the son my father always

wanted. I realise you can change the

people, change the scenery, but you can't

change your own rotten self. Now I can't

think what to do, or where to go. I'm

haunted by everything I've done, and

can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.

I've made a mess of being Dickie

Greenleaf haven't I?

Tom Ripley

and places the letter on top of the piano

PETER

(indicating the taxi stop)

I'll see you over there!

RIPLEY

Peter, I'm really sorry to put you

through this. I just couldn't face going

to the police by myself when my Italian's

so rotten.

PETER

Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted

you finally made it to Venice. I'm

delighted, contrary to rumour, you're

still in one piece?

RIPLEY

What rumour?

PETER

That Dickie murdered you and is

travelling under your passport. I know,

ridiculous.

PETER

Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,

doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.

Sorry. Not the best way to spend your

first day.

RIPLEY

It's okay.

PETER

Anyway I've got to the bottom of the

delay. Finally.  We're waiting for

someone from Rome.

RIPLEY

(completely thrown)

What do you mean?  They're sending

someone from Rome?

PETER

That's good, isn't it?

RIPLEY

(as if suffocating)

No, but I thought that didn't happen in

Italy, that each region was completely

separate! I was

sure

that was the -

PETER

You've seen the papers, you know what a

big deal it's been here. American tourist

murdered -

RIPLEY

It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned

the stench I can hardly breathe.

POLICEMAN

Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di

Roma.

VERRECCHIA

(to Peter, in Italian)

Qui e Ripley?

Who is Ripley?

PETER

(in Italian)

Lui.

Him.

VERRECCHIA

Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in

seguito alla negativa valutazione delle

disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con

il mio predecessore Roverini che come e

noto non e riuscito a impedire il

verificarsi della scomparsa del signor

Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona

al momento passibile di incriminazione

del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

PETER

(translating)

He's taken over the case because...

they're annoyed the previous chap let

Dickie...disappear when he was the only,

he was the only suspect in Freddie's

murder.

VERRECCHIA

Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il

signor Ripley ha visto il signor

Greenleaf?

(When was the last time Ripley saw

Greenleaf?)

RIPLEY

In Rome, about three weeks ago.

(shrugs)

I knew that one.

PETER

(giving Ripley a look)

A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

VERRECCHIA

Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

PETER

(translating)

Where have you been since then?

RIPLEY

I've been backpacking.

PETER

I don't know how to translate that.

(he tries)

E difficile....il signor Ripley

....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

VERRECCHIA

All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

PETER

He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping

outside.

VERRECCHIA

Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze

omosessuali?

PETER

Are you a homosexual?

(then as himself)

Interesting non-sequitur.

RIPLEY

No.

PETER

(translates for him)

No.

(as Peter, drily)

By the way, officially there are no

Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,

Michelangelo very inconvenient.

RIPLEY

Tell him I have a fiancEe, Dickie has a

fiancEe and Freddie Miles probably had a

string of them.

PETER

(translating)

Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il

signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e

probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha

molte fidanzate.

VERRECCHIA

(laughs)

Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

RIPLEY

What did he say?

PETER

He says

so many fiancEes

.

VERRECCHIA

(suddenly very tough)

Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo

Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

PETER

He wants to know if you killed Freddie

Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

RIPLEY

(outraged)

No I did not. I did not kill Freddie

Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is

he accusing me?

(Peter clearly doesn't ask)

Ask him if he's accusing me!

PETER

He's already angry, I don't think -

RIPLEY

(interrupting, heated)

Just because he doesn't like Americans!

VERRECCHIA

Non e questo il luogo per le vostre

conversazioni private!

(This is not the

place for your private conversations)

PETER

(appeasing him)

A ragione.  A ragione.

(You're right.

You're right.)

VERRECCHIA

Hmm. C'e questa...

(There's this...)

VERRECCHIA

(cont'd)

Questa lettera e stata trovata

nell'abitazione del signor Richard

Greenleaf a Roma.

PETER

They found this in Dickie's place in

Rome.

RIPLEY

You opened this?

VERRECCHIA

Of course!

RIPLEY

(to Peter)

It's a suicide note.

(to Verrecchia)

You ask me all these questions and you've

already read this suicide note?

Stabat Mater

. Peter's made supper.

PETER

Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill

Freddie, what must that be like? To wake

up every morning, how can you? Just wake

up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

RIPLEY

Whatever you do, however terrible,

however hurtful - it all makes sense,

doesn't it? inside your head. You never

meet anybody who thinks they're a bad

person or that they're cruel.

PETER

But you're still tormented, you must be,

you've killed somebody...

RIPLEY

Don't you put the past in a room, in the

cellar, and lock the door and just never

go in there? Because that's what I do.

PETER

Probably. In my case it's probably a

whole building.

RIPLEY

Then you meet someone special and all you

want to do is toss them the key, say

open

up, step inside

, but you can't because

it's dark and there are demons and if

anybody saw how ugly it was...

PETER

That's the music talking. Harder to be

bleak if you're playing

Knees up Mother

Brown

.

RIPLEY

I keep wanting to do that - fling open

the door - let the light in, clean

everything out. If I could get a huge

eraser and rub everything out...starting

with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

PETER

(as Ripley falls silent)

No key, huh?

MARGE

(kissing him warmly)

Hello Peter, so good to see you.

RIPLEY

Hello Marge!

MARGE

(coolly)

Tom.

MARGE (cont'd)

So you found Peter...

PETER

I think we sort of found each other.

PETER (cont'd)

Where's Dickie's father?

MARGE

He's not coming till the morning.

Evidently his stomach - I don't think the

food here is agreeing with him.

RIPLEY

I was looking forward to seeing him.

MARGE

Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of

that. There's a private detective on the

case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's

father's employing him.

RIPLEY

That's a terrific idea.

MARGE

He's American. He's already discovered

Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day

before he disappeared.

MARGE (cont'd)

Is that what you do before you jump in

the Tiber?  I don't think so.

MARGE

(to Peter)

Is this you?

PETER

No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

MARGE

Golly. Who's paying for this?

RIPLEY

Peter found it for me. I can afford it

because it's damp and, and falling down.

MARGE

This is spectacular.

PETER

That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's

better than squeezing into my room, and I

know how you hate hotels.

MARGE

A hotel would've been fine.

(to Ripley)

We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far

his dollar has stretched.

PETER

What's funny?

MARGE

No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when

Tom arrived in Mongi.

(to Ripley)

And now look at you.

RIPLEY

Look at me what?

MARGE

To the manner born.

RIPLEY

Mr Greenleaf.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Tom. How are you?  You look well.

RIPLEY

I'm well, thank you.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Far cry from New York.

RIPLEY

Yes it is.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

MARGE

Very.

RIPLEY

And you, sir?  Any better?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

MARGE

Where's Mr MacCarron?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,

my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,

hasn't it?

RIPLEY

Yes.  What's the detective hoping to

find in San Remo?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

He's being thorough, that's all. I'm

learning about my son, Tom, now he's

missing. I'm learning a great deal about

him. I hope you can fill in some more

blanks for me. Marge has been good enough

to do that, about Mongibello.

RIPLEY

I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do

anything to help Dickie.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

This theory, the letter he left for you,

the Police think that's a clear

indication he was planning on doing

something...to himself.

MARGE

I just don't believe that!

HERBERT GREENLEAF

You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk

to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?

Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say

to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to

another fellow -

MARGE

Such as?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

What a waste of lives and opportunities

and -

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(cont'd)

- I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars

right now to shut up!

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(reading, plunging into gloom)

No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

RIPLEY

I think it might hurt her to know.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

And his passport photo? Did you hear? To

scratch out your own face like that - can

you imagine - the frame of mind you'd

have to be in?

(reading)

I've thought about going to the police

but I can't face it. I can't face

anything anymore.

RIPLEY

I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him

away. I spoke and he heard you.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(such a disappointed father)

Well, if we all pushed him away what

about him pushing us away? You've been a

great friend to my son. Everything is

someone else's fault. We all want to sow

wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the

word?

(Ripley shakes his head)

The moment someone confronts him he

lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,

people always say you can't choose your

parents, but you can't choose your

children.

RIPLEY

I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have

fallen asleep.

PETER

You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

MARGE

Did Dickie's Dad go?

RIPLEY

He's having an early night.

MARGE

Poor man.

(she heads to her room)

We were knocking on that door for ever.

(she fiddles inside the sleeve

of her dress)

I think I've broken my strap.

PETER

Not guilty.

RIPLEY

I'll fix some drinks.

MARGE

You

walk

in Venice!

PETER

Are you okay?

RIPLEY

I'm fine.

PETER

(a hand on his shoulder)

Do you want me to stick around?

RIPLEY

It's okay.

PETER

Or I could come back.

PETER (cont'd)

Your key.

MARGE (O/S)

Tom?

RIPLEY

Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

MARGE (O/S)

Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

MARGE

I found Dickie's rings.

RIPLEY

What?

MARGE

You've got Dickie's rings.

RIPLEY

I can explain.

MARGE

Dickie promised me he would never take

off this ring.

RIPLEY

Let me put on some clothes and then we

can talk about this.

MARGE

I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to

tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr

Greenleaf.

RIPLEY

Marge, calm down, you're being

hysterical.

MARGE

He promised me.

I swear I'll never take

off this ring until the day -

RIPLEY

Shut up! Shut up!

RIPLEY (cont'd)

I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd

really like to put my clothes on. So go

and pour us both a drink, will you?

RIPLEY

Marge?  Where are you going?

MARGE

(like a creature caught in

headlights)

I was looking for a needle and thread. I

wasn't snooping. I was looking for a

needle and thread to mend my bra.

RIPLEY

The scent you're wearing.

I

bought it for

you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.

So many things. The day he was late back

from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he

was with another girl. I'm not talking

about Meredith, another girl we met in a

bar. He couldn't be faithful for five

minutes. So when he makes a promise it

doesn't mean what it means when you make

a promise. Or I do. He has so many

realities, Dickie, and he believes them

all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half

the time he doesn't even realize.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

Today, for the first time, I've even

wondered whether he might have killed

Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody

contradicted him - well, you know that.

Marge. I loved you - you might as well

know - I loved you, and because he knew I

loved you, he let you think I loved him.

Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't

know, maybe it's grotesque to say this

now, so just write it on a piece of paper

or something, and keep it in your purse

for a rainy day.

Tom loves me.

MARGE

(as if she'd heard nothing)

Why do you have Dickie's rings?

RIPLEY

I told you. He gave them to me.

MARGE

Why? When?

RIPLEY

I feel as if you haven't heard anything

I've been saying to you.

MARGE

I don't believe you.

RIPLEY

It's all true.

MARGE

I don't believe a single word you've

said.

RIPLEY

You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?

Would you let me hold you?

straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come

MARGE

(sobbing uncontrollably)

Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

PETER

Tom, are you okay?

RIPLEY

You try. You try talking to her.

PETER

(calls after him)

Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

RIPLEY

(not turning around)

I give up.

PETER

You can't be angry with her.  She's upset

and needs someone to blame. So she blames

you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As

for you - either get a safety razor or

grow a beard.

RIPLEY

Is Mr Greenleaf here?

MACCARRON

Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

MARGE (O/S)

I don't know, I don't know, I just know

it.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(O/S)

Marge, there's female intuition, and

then there are facts -

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Tom.

RIPLEY

Hello, sir.

(smiles thinly at Marge)

Marge, you should have waited, didn't

Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you

up?

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Marge has been telling us about the

rings.

RIPLEY

You know I feel ridiculous I didn't

mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -

ridiculous.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

Perhaps you didn't mention them because

there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

HERBERT GREENLEAF

(cont'd)

I'm going to take Marge for a little

walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk

with you.

RIPLEY

(feeling caged in)

We could go down to the bar - no need for

you to -

HERBERT GREENLEAF

No, he should talk to you alone.

RIPLEY

I could probably see my bedroom from

here. I can see my house. When you see

where you live from a distance it's like

a dream, isn't it?

MACCARRON

(coming out)

I don't care for B.S. I don't care to

hear it. I don't care to speak it.

RIPLEY

Okay.

MACCARRON

Why do you think Dickie's father sent him

to Europe in the first place? Did you

know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-

killed a boy?

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the

kid several times in the head. Put him in

the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in

his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to

ask Mr Greenleaf.

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

Nor did they think to check whether a

Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at

Princeton University. I turned up a Tom

Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the

music department.

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

See - in America we're taught to check a

fact before it becomes a fact. We're

taught to nose around when a girl drowns

herself, find out if that girl was

pregnant, find out if Dickie had an

embarrassment there.

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.

He really does. Marge, she's got a

hundred theories, but there are a few

things she doesn't know. We hope she

never knows.

RIPLEY

I hope she never knows.

MACCARRON

Three different people saw Dickie get

into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't

identify himself because he was jumping

someone else's wife at the time saw

Dickie removing license plates from a red

sports car. The Police know about this

man because he happens to be a Policeman.

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

I found these in the basement of Dickie's

apartment. They belonged to Freddie's

car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose

them in the canal this evening.

MACCARRON

(cont'd)

Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a

silent promise in Dickie's letter to you

which he intends to honor. He intends to

transfer a good part of Dickie's income

from his trust into your name. He doesn't

intend to give the Italian police any

information about Dickie's past. He's

rather hoping you'll feel the same.

RIPLEY

(to Marge)

I feel I never should have said those

things to you the other evening. I was

pretty flustered, the rings and - and you

looked so, I don't know.

RIPLEY (cont'd)

But I hope that note goes to New York in

your purse, for a rainy day.

MARGE

What are you going to do now, Tom?

RIPLEY

I don't know. Peter has a concert in

Athens next month - and he's asked if I

want to go along, help out. He says

goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,

otherwise -

MARGE

Why do I think there's never been a

Ripley rainy day?

RIPLEY

What?

MARGE

(lunging at him)

I know it was you - I know it was you,

Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed

Dickie. I know it was you.

RIPLEY

Oh Marge.

what can you

MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the

RIPLEY

Ask me what I want to change about this

moment.

PETER

What do you want to change about this

moment?

RIPLEY

Nothing.

PETER

Hello.  What are you up to?

RIPLEY

All kinds of things. Making plans.

PETER

Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans

for the future?

RIPLEY

I don't know. Both. My plan right now is

to go up on deck, look at the sunset.

Come with me.

PETER

You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.

Come back though.  Come back.

(smiles at him)

You know, you look so relaxed, like a

completely different person.

RIPLEY

Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,

if I fall overboard, that'll be your

fault too.

MEREDITH

Dickie?  Dickie?

MEREDITH (cont'd)

Dickie, my God!

RIPLEY

Hello Meredith.

MEREDITH

I was looking at you, your clothes, I

wouldn't have known you...

RIPLEY

Well, you've spotted me and so you get

the reward.

MEREDITH

What?

RIPLEY

Just kidding. Are you alone?

MEREDITH

Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

RIPLEY

Of course.  Aunt Joan.

MEREDITH

And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've

thought about you so much.

RIPLEY

I've thought about you.

I can't kill them all...

MEREDITH

When I thought about you I was mostly

hating you. Where've you been hiding?

RIPLEY

I haven't been hiding. I've been in

Police custody. They've been trying to

flush out Freddie's killer.

MEREDITH

You're kidding.

RIPLEY

They're letting me have this vacation.

Which is why the get-up. Which is why you

haven't heard from me.

MEREDITH

You know, the whole world thinks you

killed Freddie? It's terrible.

RIPLEY

I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.

Later?

MEREDITH

So - are you travelling under R?

RIPLEY

You know what - I am.

MEREDITH

Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-

Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought

she saw him.

RIPLEY

(horrified)

Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him

in months.  No, I'm alone.

(and he understands this is not

any kind of lie)

PETER

How was it?

RIPLEY

Good. But I think we should stay in here

for the rest of the trip.

PETER

Was that Meredith?

RIPLEY

(sighs)

Was who Meredith?

PETER

Meredith Logue. You were kissing

somebody. Looked like Meredith.

RIPLEY

Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

PETER

Didn't look that way - you know - from a

distance.

RIPLEY

I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen

you.

PETER

Why lie?

RIPLEY

Dickie and Peter, that's just too good

gossip, isn't it?

PETER

Or

Tom

and Peter even.

RIPLEY

Well that would be even better gossip.

PETER

Really, why?

(completely lost)

Sorry, I'm completely lost.

RIPLEY

I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be

stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's

my, that's my - terrible and alone and

dark - and I've lied about who I am, and

where I am, and so nobody can ever find

me.

PETER

What do you mean

lied about who you are?

RIPLEY

I suppose I always thought - better to be

a fake somebody than a real nobody.

PETER

What are you talking about - you're not a

nobody! That's the last thing you are.

RIPLEY

Peter, I... I...

PETER

(conciliatory)

And don't forget. I have the key.

RIPLEY

You have the key. Tell me some good

things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.

Just tell me some nice things.

PETER

Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take

some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is

tender... Tom is beautiful...

RIPLEY

(during this, and tender)

You're such a liar...

PETER

...Tom is a mystery...

PETER (O/S)

(cont'd)

...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets

he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he

would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a

good thing. Tom has someone to love him.

That is a good thing!

(feeling Ripley's weight on

him)

Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.

(suddenly alarmed)

Tom, you're crushing me!
