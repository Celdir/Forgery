Final Shooting Script

December 20, 2011

HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)

Some of us was in the Second Kansas

Colored. We fought the rebs at

Jenkins' Ferry last April, just

after they'd killed every Negro

soldier they captured at Poison

Springs.

HAROLD GREEN

So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided

warn't taking no reb prisoners.

And we didn't leave a one of `em

alive. The ones of us that didn't

die that day, we joined up with the

116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp

Nelson Kentucky.

LINCOLN

What's your name, soldier?

HAROLD GREEN

Private Harold Green, sir.

2.

IRA CLARK

I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth

Massachusetts Cavalry. We're

waiting over there.

IRA CLARK (CONT'D)

We're leaving our horses behind,

and shipping out with the 24th

Infantry for the assault next week

on Wilmington.

LINCOLN

(to Harold Green:)

How long've you been a soldier?

HAROLD GREEN

Two year, sir.

LINCOLN

Second Kansas Colored Infantry,

they fought bravely at Jenkins'

Ferry.

HAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK

soldiers, sir. They were very

brave.

(hesitating, then)

And making three dollars less

each month than white

soldiers.

HAROLD GREEN

Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we

fight now we -

IRA CLARK

Another three dollars subtracted

from our pay for our uniforms.

HAROLD GREEN

That was true, yessir, but that

CHANGED -

IRA CLARK

Equal pay now. Still no

commissioned Negro officers.

LINCOLN

I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.

3.

IRA CLARK

Yes, sir, that's good you're aware,

sir. It's only that -

HAROLD GREEN

(to Lincoln, trying to

change the subject:)

You think the Wilmington attack is

gonna be -

IRA CLARK

Now that white people have

accustomed themselves to seeing

Negro men with guns, fighting on

their behalf, and now that they can

tolerate Negro soldiers getting the

same pay - in a few years perhaps

they can abide the idea of Negro

lieutenants and captains. In fifty

years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a

hundred years - the vote.

LINCOLN

What'll you do after the war,

Corporal Clark?

IRA CLARK

Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.

LINCOLN

Perhaps I will.

IRA CLARK

But you should know, sir, that I

get sick at the smell of bootblack

and I can't cut hair.

LINCOLN

I've yet to find a man could cut

mine so it'd make any difference.

HAROLD GREEN

You got springy hair for a white

man.

4.

LINCOLN

Yes, I do. My last barber hanged

himself. And the one before that.

Left me his scissors in his will.

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER LINCOLN

SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

Damn! Damn!

We, we saw you, um. We were at, at -

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

We was at Gettysburg!

HAROLD GREEN SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER (CONT'D)

(to Green, with mild

CONTEMPT)

Naw, we didn't fight there.

We just signed up last month.

We saw him two years ago at the

cemetery dedication.

SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

Yeah, we heard you speak! We...

DAMN DAMN DAMN! Uh, hey, how tall

are you anyway?!

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

Jeez, SHUT up!

LINCOLN

Could you hear what I said?

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

No, sir, not much, it was-

SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

(he recites, fast and

MECHANICALLY:)

"Four score and seven years ago,

our fathers brought forth on this

continent a new nation, conceived

in liberty and dedicated to the

5.

proposition that all men are

created equal."

LINCOLN

That's good, thank you for -

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

"Now we are engaged in a great

civil war, testing whether that

nation or any nation so conceived

and so dedicated can long endure.

We are, we are, we are met on a

great battlefield of that war."

LINCOLN

Thank you, that's -

SECOND WHITE SOLDIER

"We have come to dedicate a portion

of that field as a final resting

place for those who here gave their

lives that that nation might live.

It is..."

(He chokes up a little.)

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

His uncles, they died on the second

day of fighting.

SECOND WHITE SOLDIER A VOICE (O.C.)

LINCOLN

(to the two white

SOLDIERS:)

You fellas best find your company.

FIRST WHITE SOLDIER

(SALUTING LINCOLN:)

Thank you, sir. God bless you!

LINCOLN

God bless you.

6.

IRA CLARK

"That we here highly resolve that

these dead shall not have died in

VAIN -- "

IRA CLARK (CONT'D)

" - That this nation, under God,

shall have a new birth of freedom --

and that government of the people,

by the people, for the people,

shall not perish from the earth."

TITLE:

JANUARY, 1865

TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S RE-ELECTION

THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR

LINCOLN (V.O.)

It's nighttime. The ship's moved

by some terrible power, at a

terrific speed.

7.

LINCOLN (V.O.)

Though it's imperceptible in the

darkness, I have an intuition that

we're headed towards a shore. No

one else seems to be aboard the

vessel. I'm alone.

LINCOLN

I could be bounded in a nutshell

and count myself a king of infinite

space...were it not that I have bad

dreams.

I reckon it's the speed that's

strange to me. I'm used to going a

deliberate pace.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I should spare you. I shouldn't

tell you my dreams.

MARY

I don't want to be spared if you

aren't! And you spare me nothing.

MARY (CONT'D)

Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on

Wilmington port. You dream about

the ship before a battle, usually.

8.

LINCOLN

(rapping lightly on his

FOREHEAD:)

How's the coconut?

MARY

Beyond description.

MARY (CONT'D)

Almost two years, nothing mends.

Another casualty of the war. Who

wants to listen to a useless woman

grouse about her carriage accident?

LINCOLN

I do.

MARY

Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's

all, I'm your soothsayer, that's

all I am anymore, I'm not to be

trusted with - Even if it wasn't a

carriage accident, even if it was

an attempted assassination -

LINCOLN

It was most probably an -

MARY

It was an assassin. Whose intended

target was you.

LINCOLN

How's the plans for the big shindy

progressing?

MARY

I don't want to talk about parties!

You don't care about parties.

LINCOLN

Not much but they're a necessary -

MARY

I know...I know what it's about.

The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port,

it's not a military campaign! It's

the amendment to abolish slavery!

Why else would you force me to

9.

invite demented radicals into my

home?

MARY (CONT'D)

You're going to try to get the

amendment passed in the House of

Representatives, before the term

ends, before the Inauguration.

LINCOLN

(STANDING:)

Don't spend too much money on the

flubdubs.

MARY

No one's loved as much as you, no

one's ever been loved so much, by

the people, you might do anything

now. Don't, don't waste that power

on an amendment bill that's sure of

defeat.

MARY (CONT'D)

Did you remember Robert's coming

home for the reception?

MARY (CONT'D)

I knew you'd forget.

MARY (CONT'D)

That's the ship you're sailing on.

The Thirteenth Amendment. You

needn't tell me I'm right. I know I

am.

10.

LINCOLN

It's late, Mrs. Keckley.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

(holding out the bodice:)

She needs this for the grand

reception.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY (CONT'D)

It's slow work.

LINCOLN

Good night.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

(concerned, a little

EXASPERATED:)

Did you tell her a dream?

11.

TAD

(FAST ASLEEP:)

Papa...

LINCOLN

Hmm?

TAD

Papa I wanna see Willie.

LINCOLN

(WHISPERING:)

Me too, Taddie. But we can't.

TAD

Why not?

LINCOLN

Willie's gone. Three years now.

He's gone.

12.

LINCOLN

The part assigned to me is to raise

the flag, which, if there be no

fault in the machinery, I will do,

and when up, it will be for the

people to keep it up.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

That's my speech.

AUDIENCE

"We are coming, Father Abra'am,

three hundred thousand more,

From Mississippi's winding stream

and from New England's shore..."

We leave our plows and workshops,

our wives and children dear,

With hearts too full for utterance,

With but a silent tear.

We're coming Father Abra'am..."

SEWARD

Even if every Republican in the

House votes yes - far from

guaranteed, since when has our

party unanimously supported

anything? - but say all our fellow

Republicans vote for it. We'd still

be twenty votes short.

LINCOLN

Only twenty.

13.

SEWARD

Only twenty!

LINCOLN

We can find twenty votes.

SEWARD

Twenty House Democrats who'll vote

to abolish slavery! In my opinion -

LINCOLN

To which I always listen.

SEWARD

Or pretend to.

LINCOLN

With all three of my ears.

SEWARD

We'll win the war soon - It's

inevitable, isn't it?

LINCOLN

Ain't won yit.

SEWARD

You'll begin your second term with

semi-divine stature. Imagine the

possibilities peace will bring!

Why tarnish your invaluable luster

with a battle in the House? It's a

rats' nest in there, the same gang

of talentless hicks and hacks that

rejected the amendment ten months

back. We'll lose.

LINCOLN

I like our chances now.

SEWARD

Consider the obstacles that we'd

face. The aforementioned two-thirds

majority needed to pass an

amendment: we have a Republican

14.

majority, but barely more than

fifty percent -

LINCOLN

Fifty-six.

SEWARD

We need Democratic support. There's

none to be had.

LINCOLN

Since the House last voted on the

amendment there's been an election.

Sixty-four Democrats lost their

House seats in November. That's

sixty-four Democrats looking for

work come March.

SEWARD LINCOLN

about re-election, they can

vote however it suits `em.

SEWARD LINCOLN

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I said nothing of buying anything.

We need twenty votes was all I

said. Start of my second term,

plenty of positions to fill.

JOHN NICOLAY

Mr. President, may I present Mr.

and Mrs. Jolly who've come from

Missouri to -

MR. JOLLY

From Jeff City, President.

15.

LINCOLN

Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the

fire's Secretary of State Seward.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Jeff City.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I heard tell once of a Jefferson

City lawyer who had a parrot that'd

wake him each morning crying out,

"Today is the day the world shall

end, as scripture has foretold."

And one day the lawyer shot him for

the sake of peace and quiet, I

presume, thus fulfilling, for the

bird at least, its prophecy!

MR. JOLLY

(launching into his

PREPARED SPEECH:)

They's only one tollbooth in Jeff

City, t' the southwest `n this man

Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla been in

illegal possession for near two

yar, since your man General

Schofield set him up there. But

President Monroe give that tollgate

to my granpap and Quincy Adams give

my pap a letter saying it's our'n

for keeps. Mrs. Jolly got the -

(to his wife:)

Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams

letter.

LINCOLN

That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.

Just tell me what you want from

me.

16.

MRS. JOLLY

Mr. Jolly's emphysema don't care

for cigars.

SEWARD

Madame. Do you know about the

proposed Thirteenth Amendment to

the Constitution -

MRS. JOLLY

Yes sir, everybody knows of it. The

President favors it.

SEWARD

Do you?

MRS. JOLLY

We do.

SEWARD

You know that it abolishes slavery?

MRS. JOLLY

Yes sir. I know it.

SEWARD

And is that why you favor it?

MRS. JOLLY

What I favor's ending the war.

Once't we do away with slavery, the

rebs'll quit fighting, since

slavery's what they're fighting

for. Mr. Lincoln, you always says

so. With the amendment, slavery's

ended and they'll give up. The war

can finish then.

SEWARD

If the war finished first, before

we end slavery, would -

MRS. JOLLY

President Lincoln says the war

won't stop unless we finish slavery-

SEWARD

But if it did. The South is

exhausted. If they run out of

bullets and men, would you still

17.

want your, uh - Who's your

representative?

LINCOLN

Jeff City? That's, uh, Congressman

Burton?

MRS. JOLLY

"Beanpole" Burton, I mean, Josiah

Burton, yes, sir!

LINCOLN

(to Mrs. Jolly:)

Republican. Undecided on the

question of the amendment, I

believe. Perhaps you could call on

him and inform him of your

enthusiasm.

MRS. JOLLY

Yeah...

SEWARD

Madam? If the rebels surrender next

week, would you, at the end of this

month, want Congressman Burton to

vote for the Thirteenth Amendment?

MRS. JOLLY

If that was how it was, no more war

and all, I reckon Mr. Jolly'd much

prefer not to have Congress pass

the amendment.

THE JOLLYS:

SEWARD

And why's that?

MR. JOLLY

(in a hoarse voice:)

Niggers.

MRS. JOLLY

If he don't have to let some

Alabama coon come up to Missouri,

steal his chickens, and his job,

he'd much prefer that.

18.

SEWARD

(to Lincoln, quietly:)

The people!

I begin to see why you're in such a

great hurry to put it through.

LINCOLN

(to Mr. Jolly:)

Would you let me study this letter,

sir, about the tollbooth? Come back

to me in the morning and we'll

consider what the law says.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

And be sure to visit "Beanpole" and

tell him that you support passage

of the Amendment. As a military

necessity.

NICOLAY

(to the Jollys:)

Thank you.

LINCOLN

Oh, Nicolay? When you have a

moment.

SEWARD

If procuring votes with offers of

employment is what you intend, I'll

fetch a friend from Albany who can

supply the skulking men gifted at

this kind of shady work. Spare me

the indignity of actually speaking

to Democrats. Spare you the

exposure and liability.

19.

LINCOLN

Pardon me, that's a distress

signal, which I am bound by solemn

oath to respond to.

TAD

Tom Pendel took away the glass

camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardner

sent over because Tom says mama

says they're too distressing, but-

LINCOLN

You had nightmares all night,

mama's right to -

TAD

But I'll have worse nightmares if

you don't let me look at the plates

again!

LINCOLN

Perhaps.

SEWARD

We can't afford a single defection

from anyone in our party...not even

a single Republican absent when

they vote. You know who you've got

to see.

LINCOLN

Send over to Blair House. Ask

Preston Blair can I call on him

around five o'clock.

SEWARD

(a shudder, a swallow of

BRANDY:)

God help you. God alone knows what

he'll ask you to give him.

20.

LINCOLN

If the Blairs tell `em to, no

Republican will balk at voting for

the amendment.

MONTGOMERY BLAIR

No conservative Republican is what

you mean -

PRESTON BLAIR

All Republicans ought to be

conservative, I founded this party -

in my own goddamned home - to be a

conservative antislavery party, not

a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical

abolitionists and -

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy,

you'll frighten the child.

MONTGOMERY BLAIR

(TO LINCOLN:)

You need us to keep the

conservative side of the party in

the traces while you diddle the

radicals and bundle up with

Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need

our help.

LINCOLN

Yes, sir, I do.

MONTGOMERY BLAIR

Well, what do we get?

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Whoo! Blunt! Your manners, Monty,

must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you

out of his cabinet.

PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR

21.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)

(SMILING SARCASTICALLY:)

Oh of course you weren't.

PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)

(a nod at Tad:)

Oh Daddy, please!

PRESTON BLAIR

You don't mind, boy, do you?

LINCOLN

He spends his days with soldiers.

TAD

They taught me a song!

PRESTON BLAIR

Did they? Soldiers know all manner

of songs. How's your brother Bob?

TAD

He's at school now, but he's coming

to visit in four days! For the

shindy!

PRESTON BLAIR

At school! Ain't that fine! Good

he's not in the army!

TAD

Oh he wants to be, but mama said he

CAN'T -

PRESTON BLAIR

Dangerous life, soldiering.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Your mama is wise to keep him clean

out of that.

PRESTON BLAIR

Now your daddy knows that what I

want, in return for all the help I

give him, is to go down to Richmond

like he said I could, soon as

Savannah fell, and talk to

Jefferson Davis. Give me terms I

22.

can offer to Jefferson Davis to

start negotiating for peace. He'll

talk to me!

MONTGOMERY BLAIR

Conservative members of your party

want you to listen to overtures

from Richmond. That above all.

MONTGOMERY BLAIR (CONT'D)

They'll vote for this rash and

dangerous amendment only if every

other possibility is exhausted.

PRESTON BLAIR

Our Republicans ain't

abolitionists. We can't tell our

people they can vote yes on

abolishing slavery unless at the

same time we can tell `em that

you're seeking a negotiated peace.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Leo, it's a hundred miles to

Richmond. Get him drunk so he can

sleep.

LEO

Yes'm.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Here, daddy.

23.

PRESTON BLAIR ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

BLANKET:)

Let's fix this up...

PRESTON BLAIR

Where's my hat?

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE

Leo has your hat. All right?

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)

Go make peace.

LINCOLN

(TO STANTON:)

Thunder forth, God of War!

STANTON

We'll commence our assault on

Wilmington from the sea.

(PEEVED:)

Why is this burnt? Was the boy

playing with it?

LINCOLN

It got took by a breeze several

nights back.

STANTON

This is an official War Department

map!

24.

SEWARD

And the entire cabinet's waiting to

hear what it portends.

WELLES

A bombardment. From the largest

fleet the Navy has ever assembled.

LINCOLN

(TO WELLES:)

Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks!

WELLES

Fifty-eight ships are underway, of

every tonnage and firing range.

STANTON

We'll keep up a steady barrage. Our

first target is Fort Fisher. It

defends Wilmington Port.

JAMES SPEED

A steady barrage?

STANTON

A hundred shells a minute.

STANTON (CONT'D)

Till they surrender.

WILLIAM FESSENDEN

Dear God.

WELLES

Yes. Yes.

LINCOLN

Wilmington's their last open

seaport. Therefore...

STANTON

Wilmington falls, Richmond falls

after.

25.

SEWARD

And the war... is done.

JOHN USHER

Then why, if I may ask are we not

concentrating the nation's

attention on Wilmington? Why,

instead, are we reading in the

HERALD -

(he smacks a newspaper on

THE TABLE)

- that the anti-slavery amendment

is being precipitated onto the

House floor for debate - because

your eagerness, in what seems an

unwarranted intrusion of the

Executive into Legislative

prerogatives, is compelling it to

it's... to what's likely to be its

premature demise? You signed the

Emancipation Proclamation, you've

done all that can be expected -

JAMES SPEED

The Emancipation Proclamation's

merely a war measure. After the war

the courts'll make a meal of it.

JOHN USHER

When Edward Bates was Attorney

General, he felt confident in it

enough to allow you to sign -

JAMES SPEED

(A SHRUG:)

Different lawyers, different

opinions. It frees slaves as a

military exigent, not in any other -

LINCOLN

I don't recall Bates being any too

certain about the legality of my

Proclamation, just it wasn't

downright criminal. Somewhere's in

between. Back when I rode the legal

circuit in Illinois I defended a

woman from Metamora named Melissa

Goings, 77 years old, they said she

murdered her husband; he was 83. He

was choking her; and, uh, she

grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-

26.

wood and fractured his skull, `n he

died. In his will he wrote "I

expect she has killed me. If I get

over it, I will have revenge."

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

No one was keen to see her

convicted, he was that kind of

husband. I asked the prosecuting

attorney if I might have a short

conference with my client. And she

and I went into a room in the

courthouse, but I alone emerged.

The window in the room was found to

be wide open. It was believed the

old lady may have climbed out of

it. I told the bailiff right before

I left her in the room she asked me

where she could get a good drink of

water, and I told her Tennessee.

Mrs. Goings was seen no more in

Metamora. Enough justice had been

done; they even forgave the

bondsman her bail.

JOHN USHER

I'm afraid I don't -

LINCOLN

I decided that the Constitution

gives me war powers, but no one

knows just exactly what those

powers are. Some say they don't

exist. I don't know. I decided I

needed them to exist to uphold my

oath to protect the Constitution,

which I decided meant that I could

take the rebels' slaves from `em as

property confiscated in war. That

might recommend to suspicion that I

agree with the rebs that their

slaves are property in the first

place. Of course I don't, never

have, I'm glad to see any man free,

and if calling a man property, or

war contraband, does the trick...

Why I caught at the opportunity.

Now here's where it gets truly

slippery. I use the law allowing

for the seizure of property in a

war knowing it applies only to the

property of governments and

27.

citizens of belligerent nations.

But the South ain't a nation,

that's why I can't negotiate with

'em. So if in fact the Negroes are

property according to law, have I

the right to take the rebels'

property from `em, if I insist

they're rebels only, and not

citizens of a belligerent country?

And slipperier still: I maintain it

ain't our actual Southern states in

rebellion, but only the rebels

living in those states, the laws of

which states remain in force. The

laws of which states remain in

force. That means, that since it's

states' laws that determine whether

Negroes can be sold as slaves, as

property - the Federal government

doesn't have a say in that, least

not yet -

(a glance at Seward,

THEN:)

- then Negroes in those states are

slaves, hence property, hence my

war powers allow me to confiscate

`em as such. So I confiscated `em.

But if I'm a respecter of states'

laws, how then can I legally free

`em with my Proclamation, as I

done, unless I'm cancelling states'

laws? I felt the war demanded it;

my oath demanded it; I felt right

with myself; and I hoped it was

legal to do it, I'm hoping still.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Two years ago I proclaimed these

people emancipated - "then,

thenceforward and forever free."

But let's say the courts decide I

had no authority to do it. They

might well decide that. Say there's

no amendment abolishing slavery.

Say it's after the war, and I can

no longer use my war powers to just

ignore the courts' decisions, like

I sometimes felt I had to do. Might

those people I freed be ordered

back into slavery? That's why I'd

like to get the Thirteenth

Amendment through the House, and on

28.

its way to ratification by the

states, wrap the whole slavery

thing up, forever and aye. As soon

as I'm able. Now. End of this

month. And I'd like you to stand

behind me. Like my cabinet's most

always done.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

As the preacher said, I could write

shorter sermons but once I start I

get too lazy to stop.

JOHN USHER

It seems to me, sir, you're

describing precisely the sort of

dictator the Democrats have been

howling about.

JAMES SPEED

Dictators aren't susceptible to

law.

JOHN USHER

Neither is he! He just said as

much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting

meanings? What reins him in from,

from...

LINCOLN

Well, the people do that, I

suppose. I signed the Emancipation

Proclamation a year and half before

my second election. I felt I was

within my power to do it; however I

also felt that I might be wrong

about that; I knew the people would

tell me. I gave `em a year and half

to think about it. And they re-

elected me.

(BEAT)

And come February the first, I

intend to sign the Thirteenth

Amendment.

29.

LINCOLN

Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!

Tell us the news from the Hill.

JAMES ASHLEY

Well! Ah! News -

LINCOLN

Why for instance is this thus, and

what is the reason for this

thusness?

JAMES ASHLEY

I...

SEWARD

James, we want you to bring the

anti-slavery amendment to the floor

for debate -

JAMES ASHLEY SEWARD

the amendment's manager, are

you not?

JAMES ASHLEY

I am, of course - But -

Immediately?

SEWARD

And we're counting on robust

radical support, so tell Mr.

Stevens we expect him to put his

back into it, it's not going to be

easy, but we trust -

JAMES ASHLEY

It's impossible. No, I am sorry,

no, we can't organize anything

immediately in the House. I have

been canvassing the Democrats since

the election, in case any of them

softened after they got walloped.

But they have stiffened if

anything, Mr. Secretary. There

aren't nearly enough votes -

LINCOLN

We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!

30.

JAMES ASHLEY

Whalers? As in, um, whales?

LINCOLN

We've been chasing this whale for a

long time. We've finally placed a

harpoon in the monster's back.

It's in, James, it's in! We finish

the deed now, we can't wait! Or

with one flop of his tail he'll

smash the boat and send us all to

eternity!

SEWARD

On the 31st of this month. Of this

year. Put the amendment up for a

vote.

BLUFF WADE

Whalers?

JAMES ASHLEY

That's what he said.

BLUFF WADE

The man's never been near a whale

ship in his life!

(TO STEVENS:)

Withdraw radical support, force him

to abandon this scheme, whatever

he's up to - He drags his feet

about everything, Lincoln; why this

urgency? We got it through the

Senate without difficulty because

31.

we had the numbers. Come December

you'll have the same in the House.

The amendment'll be the easy work

of ten minutes.

ASA VINTNER LITTON

He's using the threat of the

amendment to frighten the rebels

into an immediate surrender.

SCHUYLER COLFAX

I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.

ASA VINTNER LITTON

Will you rejoice when the Southern

states have re-joined the Union,

pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them

to, and one by one each refuses to

ratify the amendment? If we pass

it, which we won't.

(TO STEVENS:)

Why are we co-operating with, with

him? We all know what he's doing

and we all know what he'll do. We

can't offer up abolition's best

legal prayer to his games and

He's said he'd welcome the South

back with all its slaves in chains.

JAMES ASHLEY

Three years ago he said that! To

calm the border states when we were-

THADDEUS STEVENS

I don't.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

You said "we all know what he'll

do." I don't know.

ASA VINTNER LITTON

You know he isn't to be trusted.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Trust? I'm sorry, I was under the

misapprehension your chosen

profession was politics. I've never

trusted the President. I never

32.

trust anyone. But... Hasn't he

surprised you?

ASA VINTNER LITTON

No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Nothing surprises you, Asa,

therefore nothing about you is

surprising. Perhaps that is why

your constituents did not re-elect

you to the coming term.

(collecting his cane and

STANDING:)

It's late, I'm old, I'm going home.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

Lincoln the inveterate dawdler,

Lincoln the Southerner, Lincoln the

capitulating compromiser, our

adversary - and leader of the

godforsaken Republican Party, our

party - Abraham Lincoln has asked

us to work with him to accomplish

the death of slavery in America.

(BEAT:)

Retain, even in opposition, your

capacity for astonishment.

SEWARD

The President is never to be

mentioned. Nor I. You're paid for

your discretion.

33.

W.N. BILBO

Hell, you can have that for

nothin', what we need money for is

bribes. It'd speed things up.

SEWARD

No. Nothing strictly illegal.

ROBERT LATHAM

It's not illegal to bribe

Congressmen. They starve

otherwise.

RICHARD SCHELL

I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and

Mr. Latham that we're offering

patronage jobs to the Dems who vote

yes. Jobs and nothing more.

SEWARD

That's correct.

W.N. BILBO

Congressmen come cheap! Few

thousand bucks'll buy you all you

need.

SEWARD

The President would be unhappy to

hear you did that.

W.N. BILBO

Well, will he be unhappy if we

lose?

SEWARD

The money I managed to raise for

this endeavor is only for your

fees, food, and lodgings.

W.N. BILBO

Uh huh. If that squirrel-infested

attic you've quartered us in's any

measure, you ain't raised much.

RICHARD SCHELL

Shall we get to work?

JANUARY 9

FERNANDO WOOD

Estimable colleagues. Two bloody

years ago this month, his Highness,

King Abraham Africanus the First -

our Great Usurping Caesar, violator

of habeas corpus and freedom of the

press, abuser of states' rights -

HIRAM PRICE FERNANDO WOOD

end of the war, which yet

rages on and on.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM

AMBITIONS -

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)

abolitionist fanaticism!

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)

His Emancipation Proclamation has

obliterated millions of dollars'

worth of personal property rights -

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) RICHARD SCHELL

RICHARD SCHELL

Perhaps he'll jump.

36.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) W.N. BILBO

John Ellis is going to break

his watch if he doesn't stop -

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)

We are once again asked - nay,

commanded - to consider a proposed

thirteenth amendment which, if

passed, shall set at immediate

liberty four million coloreds while

manacling the limbs of the white

race in America. If it is passed -

but it shall not pass!

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM

W.N. BILBO

Looks like he ate a bad

oyster.

THADDEUS STEVENS

A point of order, Mr. Speaker, if

you please? When will Mr. Wood -

FERNANDO WOOD

Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor

and the gentleman from Pennsylvania

is out of order!

THADDEUS STEVENS

- when will Mr. Wood conclude his

interminable gabble? Some of us

breathe oxygen, and we find the

mephitic fumes of his oratory a

lethal challenge to our pleural

capacities.

37.

FERNANDO WOOD

We shall oppose this amendment, and

any legislation that so affronts

natural law, insulting to God as to

man! Congress must never declare

equal those whom God created

unequal!

THADDEUS STEVENS

Slavery is the only insult to

natural law, you fatuous

nincompoop!

GEORGE PENDLETON

Order! Procedure! Mr. Speaker, Mr.

Wood has the floor!

(TO STEVENS:)

Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner,

what is unnatural, in your opinion?

Niggrahs casting ballots? Niggrah

representatives? Is that natural,

Stevens? Intermarriage?

THADDEUS STEVENS

What violates natural law? Slavery,

and you, Pendleton, you insult God,

you unnatural noise.

PRESTON BLAIR

Jefferson Davis is sending three

delegates: Stephens, Hunter and

Campbell: Vice President of the

Confederacy, their former Secretary

of State, and their Assistant

41.

Secretary of War. They're coming in

earnest to propose peace.

PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D)

I know this is unwelcome news for

you. Now hear me: I went to

Richmond to talk to traitors, to

smile at and plead with traitors,

because it'll be spring in two

months, the roads'll be passable,

the Spring slaughter commences.

Four bloody Springs now! Think of

my Frank, who you've taken to your

heart, how you'll blame yourself if

the war takes my son as it's taken

multitudes of sons. Think of all

the boys who'll die if you don't

make peace. You must talk with

these men!

LINCOLN

I intend to, Preston. And in

return, I must ask you -

PRESTON BLAIR LINCOLN

THE -

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Not now!

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home.

ROBERT

Thank you.

LINCOLN PRESTON BLAIR

(to Robert:) (pointedly:)

LINCOLN

(dismissing Robert,

UNINTENTIONALLY ABRUPT)

Just give us a moment please,

Robert. Thank you.

PRESTON BLAIR

I will procure your votes for you,

as I promised. You've always kept

your word to me. Those Southern men

are coming.

(taking Lincoln's hand)

I beg you, in the name of Gentle

CHRIST -

PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) LINCOLN

LINCOLN

(SHARPLY)

I understand, Preston.

ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.)

We have one abstention so far -

RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)

Jacob Graylor -

RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)

He'd like to be Federal Revenue

Assessor for the Fifth District of

Pennsylvania.

43.

ROBERT LATHAM

- so the total of representatives

voting three weeks from today is

reduced to 182, which means 122 yes

votes to reach the requisite two-

thirds of the House. Assuming all

Republicans vote for the

amendment...?

ROBERT LATHAM (CONT'D)

Then, despite our abstention, to

reach a two-thirds majority we

remain 20 yeses short.

ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.)

For which we're seeking from among

64 lame duck Democrats. Fully 39 of

these we deem unredeemable no

votes.

W.N. BILBO

The kind that hates niggers, hates

God for making niggers.

ROBERT LATHAM

The Good Lord on High would despair

of their souls.

SEWARD

(DISTASTEFULLY:)

Thank you for that pithy

explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

RICHARD SCHELL

We've abandoned these 39 to the

Devil that possesses them.

we've been working with a purpose -

W.N. BILBO

Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

46.

CLAY HAWKINS

T-tax collector for the Western

Reserve. Th-th-that pays

handsomely.

W.N. BILBO

Don't just reach for the highest

branches. They sway in every

breeze. Assistant Port Inspector of

Marlston looks like the ticket to

me.

CLAY HAWKINS

Uh, boats, they, they make me sick.

CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D)

So just stand on the dock. Let the

Assistant Assistant Port

Inspector's stomach go weak.

SEWARD

And lastly, Democratic yes vote

number six. Hawkins from Ohio.

LINCOLN

Six.

SEWARD

Well, thus far. Plus Graylor's

abstention. From tiny acorns and so

on.

LINCOLN

What'd Hawkins get?

47.

JOHN NICOLAY

(STILL WRITING:)

Postmaster of the Millersburg Post

Office.

LINCOLN

He's selling himself cheap, ain't

he?

SEWARD

He wanted tax collector of the

Western Reserve - a first-term

congressman who couldn't manage re-

election, I felt it unseemly and

they bargained him down to

Postmaster.

(TO NICOLAY:)

Scatter `em over several rounds of

appointments, so no one notices.

And burn this ledger, please, after

you're done.

LINCOLN

(TO NICOLAY:)

Time for my public opinion bath.

Might as well let `em in.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis!

Thirteen to go!

SEWARD

One last item, an absurdity, but -

My associates report that among the

Representatives a fantastical

rumor's bruited about, which I

immediately disavowed, that you'd

allowed bleary old Preston Blair to

sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff

Davis to send commissioners up to

Washington with a peace plan.

SEWARD (CONT'D)

I, of course, told them you would

never...Not without consulting me,

you wouldn't...Because why on earth

would you?

LATE AFTERNOON

ROBERT (O.C.)

You drafted half the men in Boston!

What do you think their families

think about me?

51.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

The only reason they don't throw

things and spit on me is `cause

you're so popular. I can't

concentrate on, on British

mercantile law, I don't care about

British mercantile law. I might not

even want to be a lawyer -

LINCOLN

It's a sturdy profession, and a

useful one.

ROBERT

Yes, and I want to be useful, but

now, not afterwards!

LINCOLN

I ain't wearing them things, Mr.

Slade, they never fit right.

WILLIAM SLADE

The missus will have you wear `em.

Don't think about leaving `em.

You're delaying, that's your

favorite tactic.

WILLIAM SLADE ROBERT

I've found that prophesying is one

of life's less prophet-able

occupations!

TAD

Why do some slaves cost more than

others?

52.

ROBERT

If they're still young and healthy,

if the women can still conceive,

they'll pay more -

LINCOLN

Put `em back in the box. We'll

return them to Mr. Gardner's studio

day after next. Be careful with

`em, now.

(tugging at his gloves:)

These things should've stayed on

the calf.

When you were a slave, Mr. Slade,

did they beat you?

I was born a free man. Nobody beat

me except I beat them right back.

Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me-

WILLIAM SLADE

(TO TAD:)

Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her

if she was beaten.

TAD LINCOLN

Tad.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

(TO TAD:)

I was beaten with a fire shovel

when I was younger than you.

(TO LINCOLN:)

You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.

She's in Willie's room.

She never goes in there.

uniform.

MARY

My head hurts so.

I prayed for death the night Willie

died. The headaches are how I know

I didn't get my wish. How to endure

the long afternoon and deep into

the night.

Trying not to think about him. How

will I manage?

LINCOLN

Somehow you will.

(SAD SMILE:)

Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every

more in this terrible house

reproaching us. He was a very sick

little boy. We should've cancelled

that reception, shouldn't we?

LINCOLN

We didn't know how sick he was.

I knew, I knew, I saw that night he

was dying.

Three years ago, the war was going

so badly, and we had to put on a

ROBERT

Mother?

MARY

What?

ROBERT

You're creating a bottleneck.

MARY

Oh!

(TO STEVENS:)

Oh, I'm detaining you, and more

important, the people behind you!

How the people love my husband,

they flock to see him, by their

thousands on public days! They will

never love you the way they love

him. How difficult it must be for

you to know that. And yet how

important to remember it.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Ah, shit on the people and what

they want and what they're ready

for! I don't give a goddamn about

the people and what they want! This

is the face of someone who has

fought long and hard for the good

of the people without caring much

for any of `em. And I look a lot

worse without the wig. The people

elected me! To represent them! To

lead them! And I lead! You ought to

try it!

LINCOLN

I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,

and I have tried to profit from the

example of it. But if I'd listened

to you, I'd've declared every slave

free the minute the first shell

struck Fort Sumter; then the border

states would've gone over to the

confederacy, the war would've been

lost and the Union along with it,

and instead of abolishing slavery,

as we hope to do, in two weeks,

we'd be watching helpless as

infants as it spread from the

American South into South America.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Oh, how you have longed to say that

to me. You claim you trust them -

but you know what the people are.

You know that the inner compass

that should direct the soul toward

justice has ossified in white men

and women, north and south, unto

utter uselessness through

tolerating the evil of slavery.

White people cannot bear the

thought of sharing this country's

infinite abundance with Negroes.

LINCOLN

A compass, I learnt when I was

surveying, it'll - it'll point you

True North from where you're

standing, but it's got no advice

60.

about the swamps and deserts and

chasms that you'll encounter along

the way. If in pursuit of your

destination you plunge ahead,

heedless of obstacles, and achieve

nothing more than to sink in a

swamp, what's the use of knowing

True North?

LINCOLN

Robert's going to plead with us to

let him enlist.

MARY

Make time to talk to Robbie. You

only have time for Tad.

LINCOLN

Tad's young.

MARY

So's Robert. Too young for the

army.

LINCOLN

Plenty of boys younger than Robert

signing up...

MARY

Don't take Robbie. Don't let me

lose my son.

MARY (CONT'D)

Go away! We're occupied!

JOHN NICOLAY

Secretary Stanton has sent over to

tell you that as of half an hour

ago, the shelling of Wilmington

harbor has commenced.

61.

STANTON

They cannot possibly maintain under

this kind of an assault. Terry's

got ten thousand men surrounding

the Goddamned fort! Why doesn't he

answer my cables?

WELLES MAJOR ECKERT

STANTON (CONT'D)

They've taken 17,000 shells since

yesterday!

WELLES STANTON

Fisher's ours and Wilmington

MAJOR ECKERT has fallen!

STANTON (CONT'D)

Send another damn cable!

62.

STANTON (CONT'D)

The problem's their commander,

Whiting. He engineered the fortress

himself. The damned thing's his

child; he'll defend it till his

every last man is gone. He is not

thinking rationally, he's -

LINCOLN (O.C.)

(hollering!)

"Come on out, you old rat!"

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

That's what Ethan Allen called to

the commander of Fort Ticonderoga

in 1776. "Come on out, you old

rat!" `Course there were only forty-

odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But,

but there is one Ethan Allen story

that I'm very partial to -

STANTON

No! No, you're, you're going to

tell a story! I don't believe that

I can bear to listen to another one

of your stories right now!

STANTON (CONT'D)

I need the B&O sideyard schedules

for Alexandria! I asked for them

this morning!

LINCOLN

It was right after the Revolution,

right after peace had been

concluded, and Ethan Allen went to

London to help our new country

conduct its business with the king.

The English sneered at how rough we

are, and rude and simple-minded and

on like that, everywhere he went,

till one day he was invited to the

townhouse of a great English lord.

Dinner was served, beverages

imbibed, time passed, as happens,

and Mr. Allen found he needed the

63.

privy. He was grateful to be

directed thence - relieved you

might say.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Now, Mr. Allen discovered on

entering the water closet that the

only decoration therein was a

portrait of George Washington.

Ethan Allen done what he came to do

and returned to the drawing room.

His host and the others were

disappointed when he didn't mention

Washington's portrait. And finally

His Lordship couldn't resist, and

asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it,

the picture of Washington. He had.

Well, what did he think of its

placement, did it seem

appropriately located to Mr. Allen?

Mr. Allen said it did. His host was

astounded! Appropriate? George

Washington's likeness in a water

closet? Yes, said Mr. Allen, where

it'll do good service: the whole

world knows nothing'll make an

Englishman shit quicker than the

sight of George Washington.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I love that story.

CHARLES BENJAMIN

Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken

the port.

WELLES

And Wilmington?

64.

MAJOR ECKERT

We've taken the fort, but the city

of Wilmington has not surrendered.

STANTON

How many casualties?

FERNANDO WOOD

Heavy losses.

GEORGE PENDLETON

And more to come.

FERNANDO WOOD

Sours the national mood. That might

suffice to discourage him -

GEORGE PENDLETON

To what? To bring this down? Not in

a fight like this. This is to the

death.

FERNANDO WOOD

It's gruesome!

GEORGE PENDLETON

(GETTING UPSET:)

Are you despairing, or merely lazy?

This fight is for The United States

of America! Nothing "suffices". A

rumor? Nothing! They're not lazy!

They're busily buying votes! While

we hope to be saved by "the

national mood?!"

65.

GEORGE PENDLETON (CONT'D)

Before this blood is dry, when

Stevens next takes the floor, taunt

him - you excel at that - get him

to proclaim what we all know he

believes in his coal-colored heart:

that this vote is meant to set the

black race on high, to niggerate

America.

FERNANDO WOOD

George, please. Stay on course.

GEORGE PENDLETON

Bring Stevens to full froth. I can

ensure that every newspaperman from

Louisville to San Francisco will be

here to witness it and print it.

SCHUYLER COLFAX

The floor belongs to the

mellifluent gentleman from

Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.

GEORGE YEAMAN

I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D)

Although I'm disgusted by slavery

I rise on this sad and solemn day

to announce that I'm opposed to the

amendment. We must consider what

will become of colored folk if four

million are in one instant set

free.

ASA VINTNER LITTON

They'll be free, George! That's

what'll become of them! What'll

become of any of us?! That's what

being free means!

66.

RICHARD SCHELL

Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman

switched.

ROBERT LATHAM

(shaking his head:)

Too publicly against us. He can't

change course now.

W.N. BILBO

Not for some miserable little job

anyways.

GEORGE YEAMAN

And, and! We will be forced to

enfranchise the men of the colored

race - it would be inhuman not to!

Who among us is prepared to give

Negroes the vote?

GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D)

And, and! What shall follow upon

that? Universal enfranchisement?

Votes for women?

FERNANDO WOOD

Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post

Master of Millersburg Ohio!

GEORGE PENDLETON

Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to

inform us. Of your disgusting

betrayal. Your prostitution.

FERNANDO WOOD

Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?

Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

67.

CLAY HAWKINS

My neighbors hear that I voted yes

for nigger freedom and no to peace,

they will kill me.

RICHARD SCHELL ROBERT LATHAM

SEWARD ROBERT LATHAM

RICHARD SCHELL

Among the few remaining

representatives who seem remotely

plausible there is a perceptible

increase in resistance.

W.N. BILBO

Resistance, hell! Thingamabob

Hollister, Dem from Indiana? I

approached him, the sumbitch near

to murdered me!

SEWARD

Perhaps you push too hard.

W.N. BILBO

I push nobody. Perhaps we need

reinforcements. If Jeff Davis wants

to cease hostilities, who do you

think'll give a genuine solid shit

to free slaves?

SEWARD

Get back to it, and good day,

gentlemen.

RICHARD SCHELL

We are at an impasse.

ROBERT LATHAM

Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors.

Publicly.

RICHARD SCHELL

Tell us what you expect of us.

SEWARD

I expect you to do your work! And

to have sufficient sense and taste

not to presume to instruct the

President. Or me.

RICHARD SCHELL

Is there a Confederate offer or

not?

GRANT

I suggest you work some changes to

your proposal before you give it to

the President.

R.M.T HUNTER

We're eager to be on our way to

Washington.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us

this, General Grant?

GRANT

It says..."securing peace for our

two countries." And it goes on like

that.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

I don't know what you -

GRANT

There's just one country. You and

I, we're citizens of that country.

I'm fighting to protect it from

armed rebels. From you.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

But Mr. Blair told us, he, he told

President Davis we were -

GRANT

A private citizen like Preston

Blair can say what he pleases,

since he has no authority over

anything. If you want to discuss

peace with President Lincoln,

consider revisions.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

If we're not to discuss a truce

between warring nations, what in

heaven's name can we discuss?

GRANT

Terms of surrender.

QUEEN:

GRANT (V.O.)

"Office United States Military

Telegraph, War Dept. For Abraham

Lincoln, President of the United

States. January 20, 1865. I will

71.

state confidentially that I am

convinced, upon conversation with

these Commissioners, that their

intentions are good and their

desire sincere to restore peace and

union. I fear now their going back,

without any expression of

interest..."

GRANT (V.O.) (CONT'D) SEWARD (V.O.)

SEWARD

"...will have a bad influence.

I will be sorry should it prove

impossible for you to have an

interview with them. I am awaiting

your instructions. U.S. Grant,

Lieutenant General Commanding

Armies United States"

LINCOLN

After four years of war and near

600,000 lives lost. He believes we

can end this war now.

My trust in him is marrow deep.

SEWARD

You could bring the delegates to

Washington. In exchange for the

South's immediate surrender, we

could promise them the amendment's

defeat. They'd agree, don't you

think? We'd end the war. This week.

72.

SEWARD (CONT'D)

Or. If you could manage, without

seeming to do it, to -

SEWARD (CONT'D)

The peace delegation might

encounter delays as they travel up

the James River. Particularly with

the fighting around Wilmington.

Within ten days time, we might pass

the Thirteenth Amendment.

LINCOLN

Now, here's a sixteen year old boy.

They're going to hang him...

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

(he reads a little

FURTHER:)

He was with the 15th Indiana

Calvary near Beaufort, seems he

lamed his horse to avoid battle.

I don't think even Stanton would

73.

complain if I pardoned him? You

think Stanton would complain?

JOHN HAY

Ummm... I don't know, sir, I don't

know who you're, uh... What time is

it?

LINCOLN

It's three forty in the morning.

JOHN NICOLAY

(not waking up:)

Don't... let him pardon any more

deserters...

JOHN HAY

Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too

many. He's generally apoplectic on

the subject -

LINCOLN

He oughtn't to have done that,

crippled his horse, that was cruel,

but you don't just hang a sixteen

year old boy for that -

JOHN HAY

Ask the horse what he thinks.

LINCOLN

- for cruelty. There'd be no

sixteen year old boys left.

(a beat, then:)

Grant wants me to bring the secesh

delegates to Washington.

JOHN HAY

So... There are secesh delegates?

LINCOLN

(scribbling a note,

signing the petition:)

He was afraid, that's all it was.

I don't care to hang a boy for

being frightened, either. What good

would it do him?

74.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

War's nearly done. Ain't that so?

What use one more corpse? Any more

corpses?

JOHN HAY

Do you need company?

LINCOLN (V.O.)

Times like this, I'm best alone.

LINCOLN

"Lieutenant General Ulysses S.

Grant, City Point. I have read your

words with interest."

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

"I ask that, regardless of any

action I take in the matter of the

visit of the Richmond

commissioners, you maintain among

your troops military preparedness

for battle, as you have done until

now."

75.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

"Have Captain Saunders convey the

commissioners to me here in

Washington."

(ANOTHER PAUSE)

"A. Lincoln." And the date.

SAMUEL BECKWITH

(WHILE WRITING:)

Yes sir.

SAMUEL BECKWITH (CONT'D)

Shall I transmit, sir?

LINCOLN

(a beat, then:)

You think we choose to be born?

SAMUEL BECKWITH

I don't suppose so.

LINCOLN

Are we fitted to the times we're

born into?

SAMUEL BECKWITH

I don't know about myself. You may

be, sir. Fitted.

LINCOLN

(TO HOMER:)

What do you reckon?

HOMER BATES

I'm an engineer. I reckon there's

machinery but no one's done the

fitting.

LINCOLN

You're an engineer, you must know

Euclid's axioms and common notions.

HOMER BATES

I must've in school, but...

LINCOLN

I never had much of schooling, but

I read Euclid, in an old book I

borrowed. Little enough ever found

its way in here -

(touching his cranium)

- but once learnt it stayed learnt.

76.

Euclid's first common notion is

this: "Things which are equal to

the same thing are equal to each

other."

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

That's a rule of mathematical

reasoning. It's true because it

works; has done and always will do.

In his book, Euclid says this is

"self-evident."

(A BEAT)

D'you see? There it is, even in

that two-thousand year old book of

mechanical law: it is a self-

evident truth that things which are

equal to the same thing are equal

to each other. We begin with

equality. That's the origin, isn't

it? That balance, that's fairness,

that's justice.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Read me the last sentence of my

telegram.

SAMUEL BECKWITH

"Have Captain Saunders convey the

commissioners to me here in

Washington."

LINCOLN

A slight emendation, Sam, if you

would.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

"Have Captain Saunders convey the

gentlemen aboard the River Queen as

far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and

there wait until..."

(BEAT)

"...further advice from me. Do not

proceed to Washington."

77.

JANUARY 27

SCHUYLER COLFAX

The World, the Herald and the

Times, New York, Chicago, the

Journal of Commerce, even your

hometown paper's here.

JAMES ASHLEY

(TO STEVENS:)

Say you believe only in legal

equality for all races, not racial

equality, I beg you, sir.

Compromise. Or you risk it all.

FERNANDO WOOD

I've asked you a question, Mr.

Stevens, and you must answer me. Do

you or do you not hold that the

precept that "all men are created

equal" is meant literally?

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)

Is that not the true purpose of the

amendment? To promote your ultimate

and ardent dream to elevate -

THADDEUS STEVENS

The true purpose of the amendment,

Mr. Wood, you perfectly-named,

brainless, obstructive object?

78.

FERNANDO WOOD

You have always insisted, Mr.

Stevens, that Negroes are the same

as white men are.

THADDEUS STEVENS

The true purpose of the amendment -

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

I don't hold with equality in all

things only with equality before

the law and nothing more.

FERNANDO WOOD

(SURPRISED:)

That's not so! You believe that

Negroes are entirely equal to white

men. You've said it a thousand

TIMES -

GEORGE PENDLETON

(leaping to his feet)

For shame! For shame! Stop

prevaricating and answer

Representative Wood!

THADDEUS STEVENS GEORGE PENDLETON

JAMES ASHLEY

(LEAPING UP:)

He's answered your questions! This

amendment has naught to do with

race equality!

GEORGE PENDLETON THADDEUS STEVENS

79.

MARY

(whispering to Mrs.

KECKLEY:)

Who'd ever've guessed that old

nightmare capable of such control?

He might make a politician someday -

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

(STANDING ABRUPTLY:)

I need to go.

GEORGE PENDLETON

Your frantic attempt to delude us

now is unworthy of a

representative. It is, in fact,

unworthy of a white man!

THADDEUS STEVENS

(giving in to his anger:)

How can I hold that all men are

created equal, when here before me -

(pointing to Pendleton:)

- stands stinking the moral carcass

of the gentleman from Ohio, proof

that some men are inferior, endowed

by their Maker with dim wits

impermeable to reason with cold

pallid slime in their veins instead

of hot red blood! You are more

reptile than man, George, so low

and flat that the foot of man is

incapable of crushing you!

GEORGE PENDLETON

HOW DARE YOU!

THADDEUS STEVENS

Yet even you, Pendleton, who should

have been gibbetted for treason

long before today, even worthless

unworthy you ought to be treated

equally before the law! And so

again, sir, and again and again and

80.

again I say: I DO NOT HOLD WITH

EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS. ONLY WITH

EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.

GEORGE PENDLETON

MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS

VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO

THREATEN ME AND -

ASA VINTNER LITTON

You asked if ever I was surprised.

ASA VINTNER LITTON (CONT'D)

Today, Mr. Stevens, I was

surprised. You've led the battle

for race equality for thirty years!

The basis of, of every hope for

this country's future life, you

denied Negro equality! I'm

nauseated. You refused to say that

all humans are, well... human! Have

you lost your very soul, Mr.

Stevens? Is there nothing you won't

say?

THADDEUS STEVENS

I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa,

that must be unpleasant.

I want the amendment to pass. So

that the Constitution's first and

only mention of slavery is its

absolute prohibition. For this

amendment, for which I have worked

all of my life and for which

81.

countless colored men and women

have fought and died and now

hundreds of thousands of soldiers -

no, sir, no, it seems there is very

nearly nothing I won't say.

ROBERT

I'm not going in.

LINCOLN

You said you wanted to help me.

ROBERT

This is - This is just a clumsy

attempt at discouragement. I've

been to army hospitals, I've seen

surgeries, I went and visited the

malaria barges with mama.

LINCOLN

She told me she didn't take you

inside.

ROBERT

I snuck in after - I've seen what

it's like. This changes nothing.

LINCOLN

At all rates, I'm happy to have

your company.

LINCOLN

Morning, Jim.

82.

ARMY SURGEON

Hello, Mr. President.

LINCOLN

Good to see you again.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Well, boys, first question: You

getting enough to eat?

FIRST PATIENT

Hello, sir.

LINCOLN

What's your name, soldier?

FIRST PATIENT

Robert.

LINCOLN

Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.

SECOND PATIENT

Nice to meet you.

LINCOLN

What's your name?

SECOND PATIENT

Kevin.

LINCOLN

Tell me your names as I go past. I

like to know who I'm talkin' to.

Kevin.

THIRD PATIENT

Mr. President. John.

LINCOLN

John. I've seen you before.

FOURTH PATIENT

Mr. President...

83.

LINCOLN (O.C.)

What's the matter, Bob?

ROBERT

I have to do this! And I will do it

and I don't need your permission to

enlist.

LINCOLN

That same speech has been made by

how many sons to how many fathers

since the war began? "I don't need

your damn permission, you miserable

old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"

And what wouldn't those numberless

fathers have given to be able to

say to their sons - as I now say to

mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so

in point of fact, without my

permission, you ain't enlisting in

nothing, nowhere, young man."

84.

ROBERT

It's mama you're scared of, not me

getting killed.

ROBERT (CONT'D)

I have to do this! And I will! Or I

will feel ashamed of myself for the

rest of my life. Whether or not you

fought is what's gonna matter. And

not just to other people, but to

myself.

I won't be you, pa. I can't do

that. But I don't want to be

nothing.

LINCOLN

We can't lose you.

LINCOLN

He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's

far from the front lines, from the

fighting, he'll be an adjutant

running messages for General Grant.

MARY

The war will take our son! A

sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or

typhus, same as took Willie, it

takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll

die, uselessly, and how will I ever

forgive you? Most men, their

firstborn is their favorite, but

you, you've always blamed Robert

for being born, for trapping you in

a marriage that's only ever given

you grief and caused you regret!

85.

LINCOLN

That's not true -

MARY

And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor

is on your hands same as Grant, God

help us! We'll pay for the oceans

of spilled blood you've sanctioned,

the uncountable corpses we'll be

made to pay with our son's dear

BLOOD -

LINCOLN

Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,

I demand of you to try and take the

liberal and not the selfish point

of view! You imagine Robert will

forgive us if we continue to stifle

his very natural ambition?!

MARY

(with a mocking smile:)

And if I refuse to take the high

road, if I won't take up the rough

old cross, will you threaten me

again with the madhouse, as you did

when I couldn't stop crying over

Willie, when I showed you what

heartbreak, real heartbreak looked

like, and you hadn't the courage to

countenance it, to help me -

LINCOLN MARY

LINCOLN MARY

LINCOLN MARY

86.

LINCOLN MARY

MARY (CONT'D)

THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you

threaten me, you do it this time!

Lock me away! You'll have to, I

swear, if Robert is killed!

LINCOLN

I couldn't tolerate you grieving so

for Willie because I couldn't

permit it in myself, though I

wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl

under the earth, into the vault

with his coffin. I still do. Every

day I do.

Don't... talk to me about grief.

(BEAT:)

I must make my decisions, Bob must

make his, you yours. And bear what

we must, hold and carry what we

must. What I carry within me - you

must allow me to do it, alone as I

must. And you alone, Mary, you

alone may lighten this burden, or

render it intolerable. As you

choose.

87.

MARY

You think I'm ignorant of what

you're up to because you haven't

discussed this scheme with me as

you ought to have done. When have I

ever been so easily bamboozled?

(BEAT)

I believe you when you insist that

amending the constitution and

abolishing slavery will end this

war. And since you are sending my

son into the war, woe unto you if

you fail to pass the amendment.

LINCOLN

Seward doesn't want me leaving big

muddy footprints all over town.

MARY

No one ever lived who knows better

than you the proper placement of

footfalls on treacherous paths.

Seward can't do it. You must.

Because if you fail to secure the

necessary votes, woe unto you, sir.

You will answer to me.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

I know the vote is only four days

away; I know you're concerned.

Thank you for your concern over

this, and I want you to know:

They'll approve it. God will see

to it.

LINCOLN

I don't envy him his task. He may

wish He'd chosen an instrument for

His purpose more wieldy than the

House of Representatives.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

Then you'll see to it.

88.

LINCOLN

Are you afraid of what lies ahead?

For your people? If we succeed?

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

White people don't want us here.

LINCOLN

Many don't.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

What about you?

LINCOLN

I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.

Any of you. You're ...familiar to

me, as all people are.

Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked

creatures such as we all are. You

have a right to expect what I

expect, and likely our expectations

are not incomprehensible to each

other. I assume I'll get used to

you. But what you are to the

nation, what'll become of you once

slavery's day is done, I don't

know.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY

What my people are to be, I can't

say. Negroes have been fighting and

dying for freedom since the first

of us was a slave. I never heard

any ask what freedom will bring.

Freedom's first. As for me: My son

died, fighting for the Union,

wearing the Union blue. For freedom

he died. I'm his mother. That's

what I am to the nation, Mr.

Lincoln. What else must I be?

W.N. BILBO

My whole hand's gonna be proud in

about five seconds, let's see how

proud you gonna be.

89.

ROBERT LATHAM

Oh, it is? What you got goin'?

W.N. BILBO

Yeah?

ROBERT LATHAM

Go away!

(TO BILBO)

That watch fob, is that gold?

W.N. BILBO

You keep your eyes off my fob!

ROBERT LATHAM

Nines paired!

W.N. BILBO

Oh my God damn!

SEWARD

Gentlemen. You have a visitor.

W.N. BILBO

Well, I'll be fucked.

LINCOLN

I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...?

W.N. BILBO

W.N. Bilbo.

LINCOLN

Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

ROBERT LATHAM

Sir...

W.N. BILBO

Why are you here? No offense, but

Mr. Seward's banished the very

mention of your name, he won't even

90.

let us use fifty-cent pieces `cause

they got your face on `em.

LINCOLN

The Secretary of State here tells

me that, uh, you got eleven

Democrats in the bag. That's

encouraging.

ROBERT LATHAM

Oh, you've got no cause to be

encouraged. Sir. Uh...

RICHARD SCHELL

Are we being...fired?

LINCOLN

"We have heard the chimes of

midnight, Master Shallow." I'm here

to alert you boys that the great

day of reckoning is nigh upon us.

RICHARD SCHELL

The Democrats we've yet to bag,

sir. The patronage jobs simply

won't bag `em. They require

more...convincing, Mr. President.

LINCOLN

Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?

W.N. BILBO

Sure.

LINCOLN

Snagged my eye in the paper this

morning. Governor Curtin is set to

declare a winner in the disputed

Congressional election for the -

W.N. BILBO

Pennsylvania 16th District.

LINCOLN

What a joy to be comprehended. Hop

on a train to Philadell, call on

the Governor -

91.

SEWARD

(looking askance at

BILBO'S APPEARANCE:)

Send Latham. Or Schell.

LINCOLN

(TO BILBO:)

No, he'll do fine, just polish

yourself up first.

ROBERT LATHAM

The incumbent is claiming he won

it. Name of, uh...

W.N. BILBO

Coffroth.

LINCOLN

That's him.

RICHARD SCHELL

Coffroth. He is a Democrat.

LINCOLN W.N. BILBO

(TO SCHELL:)

SEWARD

Pity poor Coffroth.

THADDEUS STEVENS

It opens!

92.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

You are Canfrey?

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Coffroth, Mr. Stevens, Alexander

Coffroth, I'm, I'm -

THADDEUS STEVENS

(SKEPTICAL)

Are we representatives of the same

state?

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Y-yes sir! We sit only three desks

APART -

THADDEUS STEVENS

I haven't noticed you. I'm a

Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are

a Democrat?

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Well, I... Um, that is to say... I -

THADDEUS STEVENS

The modern travesty of Thomas

Jefferson's political organization

to which you have attached yourself

like a barnacle has the effrontery

to call itself The Democratic

Party. You are a Dem-o-crat.

What's the matter with you? Are you

wicked?

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Well, I felt, um, formerly, I -

THADDEUS STEVENS

Never mind, Coffsnot. You were

ignominiously trounced at the

hustings in November's election by

your worthy challenger, a

REPUBLICAN -

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

No, sir, I was not, um, trounced!

Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I

didn't lose the election -

93.

THADDEUS STEVENS

What difference does it make if you

lost or not?! The governor of our

state, is...? A Democrat?

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

No, he's a...

(baffled, terrified:)

A, um, a Ruh...

THADDEUS STEVENS

Re.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Re.

THADDEUS STEVENS

(NODS)

Pub.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Pub.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Li.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Li.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Can.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Can.

Republican.

THADDEUS STEVENS

I know what he is. This is a

rhetorical exercise. And Congress

is controlled by what party? Yours?

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

Your party was beaten, your

challenger's party now controls the

House, and hence the House

Committee on Elections, so you have

been beaten. You shall shortly be

sent home in disgrace. Unless.

94.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

I know what I must do, sir! I will

immediately become a Republican and

vote yes for -

THADDEUS STEVENS

NO! Coffroth will vote yes but

Coffroth will remain a Democrat

until after he does so.

ALEXANDER COFFROTH

Why wait to switch? I'm happy to

SWITCH -

THADDEUS STEVENS

We want to show the amendment has

bipartisan support, you idiot.

Early in the next Congress, when I

tell you to do so, you will switch

parties. Now congratulations on

your victory, and get out.

LINCOLN

Now give me the names of whoever

else you been hunting.

ROBERT LATHAM

George Yeaman.

RICHARD SCHELL

Yes. Yeaman.

W.N. BILBO

Among others. But Yeaman: That'd

count.

ROBERT LATHAM

(HELPFULLY)

Y-E-A-M-A-N

LINCOLN

I got it.

95.

ROBERT LATHAM

Kentucky.

GEORGE YEAMAN

I can't vote for the amendment, Mr.

Lincoln.

LINCOLN

I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

filled with colored men in chains,

heading down the Mississippi to the

New Orleans slave markets. It

sickened me, `n more than that, it

brought a shadow down, a pall

around my eyes.

(BEAT)

Slavery troubled me, as long as I

can remember, in a way it never

troubled my father, though he hated

it. In his own fashion. He knew no

smallholding dirt farmer could

compete with slave plantations. He

took us out from Kentucky to get

away from `em. He wanted Indiana

kept free. He wasn't a kind man,

but there was a rough moral urge

for fairness, for freedom in him. I

learnt that from him, I suppose, if

little else from him. We didn't

care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

GEORGE YEAMAN

(EMBARRASSED)

I... Well, I'm sorry to hear that -

LINCOLN

Lovingkindness, that most ordinary

thing, came to me from other

sources. I'm grateful for that.

GEORGE YEAMAN

I hate it, too, sir, slavery, but -

but we're entirely unready for

emancipation. There's too many

QUESTIONS -

96.

LINCOLN

(LAUGHS)

We're unready for peace too, ain't

we? When it comes, it'll present us

with conundrums and dangers greater

than any we've faced during the

war, bloody as it's been. We'll

have to extemporize and experiment

with what it is when it is.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I read your speech, George. Negroes

and the vote, that's a puzzle.

GEORGE YEAMAN

No, no, but, but, but - But Negroes

can't, um, vote, Mr. Lincoln.

You're not suggesting that we

enfranchise colored people.

LINCOLN

I'm asking only that you

disenthrall yourself from the slave

powers. I'll let you know when

there's an offer on my desk for

surrender.

There's none before us now. What's

before us now, that's the vote on

the Thirteenth Amendment. It's

going to be so very close.

You see what you can do.

WILLIAM HUTTON

I can't make sense of it, what he

died for. Mr. Lincoln, I hate them

all, I do, all black people. I am a

prejudiced man.

97.

LINCOLN

I'd change that in you if I could,

but that's not why I come. I might

be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I

expect... Colored people will most

likely be free, and when that's so,

it's simple truth that your

brother's bravery, and his death,

helped make it so. Only you can

decide whether that's sense enough

for you, or not.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

My deepest sympathies to your

family.

PRESTON BLAIR

(ANGRY:)

We've managed our members to a fare-

thee-well, you've had no defections

from the Republican right to

trouble you, whereas as to what you

promised - Where the hell are the

commissioners?!

JAMES ASHLEY

Oh God...

(TO LINCOLN:)

It's true! You, you...lied to me,

Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests

for a denial that, that there is a

Confederate peace offer because,

because there is one! We are

absolutely guaranteed to lose the

whole thing -

98.

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) MONTGOMERY BLAIR

LINCOLN

I can't listen to this anymore! I

can't accomplish a goddamned thing

of any human meaning or worth until

we cure ourselves of slavery and

end this pestilential war, and

whether any of you or anyone else

knows it, I know I need this! This

amendment is that cure! We're

stepped out upon the world's stage

now, now, with the fate of human

dignity in our hands! Blood's been

spilt to afford us this moment!

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Now now now! And you grousle and

heckle and dodge about like

pettifogging Tammany Hall

hucksters! See what is before you!

See the here and now! That's the

hardest thing, the only thing that

accounts! Abolishing slavery by

constitutional provision settles

the fate, for all coming time, not

only of the millions now in bondage

but of unborn millions to come. Two

votes stand in its way, and these

votes must be procured.

SEWARD

We need two yeses, three

abstentions, or four yeses and one

more abstention and the amendment

will pass -

LINCOLN

You got a night and a day and a

night and several perfectly good

hours! Now get the hell out of here

and get `em!

JAMES ASHLEY

Yes but how?

99.

LINCOLN

Buzzards' guts, man.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I am the President of the United

States of America, clothed in

immense power! You will procure me

these votes.

JANUARY 31, 1865

100.

ASA VINTNER LITTON

We welcome you, ladies and

gentlemen, first in the history of

this people's chamber, to your

House!

SCHUYLER COLFAX

Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

JAMES ASHLEY

On the matter of the joint

resolution before us, presenting a

Thirteenth Amendment to our

national Constitution, which was

passed last year by the Senate, and

which has been debated now by this

estimable body for the past several

weeks. Today we will vote...

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)

By mutual agreement we shall hear

brief final statements -

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)

- beginning with the honorable

George Pendleton of Ohio.

GEORGE PENDLETON

I've just received confirmation of

what previously has been merely

rumored! Affidavits from loyal

citizens recently returned from

101.

Richmond. They testify that

Commissioners have indeed come

north and ought to have arrived by

now in Washington City! Bearing an

offer of immediate cessation of our

civil war!

FERNANDO WOOD

(to Ashley, fake shock:)

Are there Confederate commissioners

in the Capitol?

JAMES ASHLEY

I don't... I have no idea where

they are or if they've arrived or -

FERNANDO WOOD

If they've arrived?!

GEORGE PENDLETON

I appeal to my fellow Democrats, to

all Republican representatives who

give a fig for peace! Postpone this

vote until we have answers from the

President himself!

FERNANDO WOOD

Postpone the vote!

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)

I have made a motion! Does anyone

here care to second -

102.

AARON HADDAM

(in a powerful voice:)

Gentlemen.

The conservative faction of border

and western Republicans cannot

approve this amendment, about which

we harbor grave doubts, if a peace

offer is being held hostage to its

success. Joining with our

Democratic colleagues, I second the

motion to postpone.

ROBERT LATHAM

Quick, man! Quick!

LINCOLN

This is precisely what Mr. Wood

wishes me to respond to?

103.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

Word for word? This is precisely

the assurance that he demands of

me?

W.N. BILBO

Yes sir.

LINCOLN

Give this to Mr. Ashley.

JOHN HAY

I feel, um, I have to say, Mr.

Lincoln, that this -

(annoyed, impatient, to

BILBO:)

Could you please just step

outside?!

W.N. BILBO

You gonna have a chat now, with

with the whole of the House of

Representatives waiting on that?

JOHN HAY

(TO LINCOLN:)

Making false representation to

Congress is, it's, um -

JOHN NICOLAY

It's, it's -

LINCOLN

Impeachable. I've made no false

representation.

JOHN HAY

But there are -

(WHISPERING:)

104.

There is a delegation from

Richmond.

LINCOLN

Give me the note, Johnnie.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

(TO BILBO:)

Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.

JAMES ASHLEY

From the President:

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)

"So far as I know, there are no

peace commissioners in the city

nor are there likely to be."

GEORGE PENDLETON

"So far as I know-"?! That means

nothing! Are there commissioners

from the South or aren't there?!

JAMES ASHLEY

The President has answered you,

sir! Your peace offer is a fiction!

GEORGE PENDLETON

That is not a denial, it is a

lawyer's dodge!

JAMES ASHLEY

Mr. Haddam? Is your faction

satisfied?

105.

AARON HADDAM

The conservative Republican

faction's satisfied, and we thank

Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr.

Wood's motion.

SCHUYLER COLFAX

Tabled!

JAMES ASHLEY

This isn't usual, Mr. Pendleton,

this is history.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE

THADDEUS STEVENS

The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE

That's...That's the official bill.

THADDEUS STEVENS

I'll return it in the morning.

Creased, but unharmed.

THADDEUS STEVENS

A gift for you.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)

The greatest measure of the

Nineteenth Century. Passed by

corruption, aided and abetted by

the purest man in America.

115.

THADDEUS STEVENS

I wish you'd been present.

LYDIA SMITH

I wish I'd been.

THADDEUS STEVENS

It was a spectacle.

LYDIA SMITH

You can't bring your housekeeper to

the House. I won't give them

gossip.

(THE PAPER)

This is enough. This is... It's

more than enough for now.

THADDEUS STEVENS

Read it to me again, my love.

LYDIA SMITH

"PROPOSED -"

THADDEUS STEVENS

And adopted.

LYDIA SMITH

Adopted. "An Amendment to the

Constitution of the United States.

Section One: Neither slavery nor

involuntary servitude, except as a

punishment for crime whereof the

party shall have been duly

convicted, shall exist within the

United States, or any place subject

to their jurisdiction."

THADDEUS STEVENS

SECTION TWO:

LYDIA SMITH

"Congress shall have power to

enforce this amendment by

appropriate legislation."

116.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Let me be blunt. Will the southern

states resume their former position

in the Union speedily enough to

enable us to block ratification of

the Thirteenth Amendment?

LINCOLN

I'd like peace immediately.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Yes, and...?

LINCOLN

I'd like your states restored to

their practical relations to the

Union immediately.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

If this could be given me in

writing, as Vice President of the

Confederacy, I'd bring that

document with celerity to Jefferson

Davis.

SEWARD

Surrender and we can discuss

reconstruction.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Surrender won't be thought of

unless you've assured us, in

writing, that we'll be readmitted

in time to block this amendment.

117.

R.M.T. HUNTER

This is the arrogant demand of a

conqueror for a humiliating,

ABJECT -

SEWARD

You'll not be conquered people, Mr.

Hunter. You will be citizens,

returned to the laws and the

guarantees of rights of the

Constitution.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Which now extinguishes slavery. And

with it our economy. All our laws

will be determined by a Congress of

vengeful Yankees, all our rights'll

be subject to a Supreme Court

benched by Black Republican

radicals. All our traditions will

be obliterated. We won't know

ourselves anymore.

LINCOLN

(a nod, then:)

We ain't here to discuss

reconstruction, we have no legal

basis for that discussion. But I

don't want to deal falsely. The

Northern states'll ratify, most of

`em. As I figure, it remains for

two of the Southern states to do

the same, even after all are

readmitted. And I been working on

that.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

Tennessee and Louisiana.

LINCOLN

Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be

ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

If we submit ourselves to law,

Alex, even submit to losing

freedoms - the freedom to oppress,

for instance - we may discover

other freedoms previously unknown

to us. Had you kept faith with

democratic process, as frustrating

as that can be -

118.

JOHN A. CAMPBELL

Come sir, spare us at least these

pieties. Did you defeat us with

ballots?

ALEXANDER STEPHENS

How've you held your Union

together? Through democracy? How

many hundreds of thousands have

died during your administration?

Your Union, sir, is bonded in

cannonfire and death.

LINCOLN

It may be you're right. But say all

we done is show the world that

democracy isn't chaos, that there

is a great invisible strength in a

people's union? Say we've shown

that a people can endure awful

sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't

that save at least the idea of

democracy, to aspire to?

Eventually, to become worthy of? At

all rates, whatever may be proven

by blood and sacrifice must've been

proved by now. Shall we stop this

bleeding?

APRIL 3

119.

LINCOLN

Once he surrenders, send his boys

back to their homes, their farms,

their shops.

GRANT

Yes sir, as we discussed.

LINCOLN

Liberality all around. No

punishment. I don't want that. And

the leaders - Jeff and the rest of

`em - if they escape, leave the

country while my back's turned,

that wouldn't upset me none.

120.

When peace comes it mustn't just be

hangings.

GRANT

By outward appearance, you're ten

years older than you were a year

ago.

LINCOLN

Some weariness has bit at my bones.

(BEAT)

I never seen the like of it before.

What I seen today. Never seen the

like of it before.

GRANT

You always knew that, what this was

going to be. Intimate, and ugly.

You must've needed to see it close

when you decided to come down here.

LINCOLN

We've made it possible for one

another to do terrible things.

GRANT

And we've won the war. Now you have

to lead us out of it.

AFTERNOON

APRIL 9, 1865

121.

MARY

You've an itch to travel?

LINCOLN

I'd like that. To the West by rail.

MARY

(shaking her head no:)

Overseas.

LINCOLN

The Holy Land.

MARY

(a laugh, then:)

Awfully pious for a man who takes

his wife out buggy-riding on Good

Friday.

LINCOLN

Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon

walked. I dream of walking in that

ancient city.

MARY

All anyone will remember of me is I

was crazy and I ruined your

happiness.

LINCOLN

Anyone thinks that doesn't

understand, Molly.

122.

MARY

When they look at you, at what it

cost to live at the heart of this,

they'll wonder at it. They'll

wonder at you. They should. But

they should also look at the

wretched woman by your side, if

they want to understand what this

was truly like. For an ordinary

person. For anyone other than you.

LINCOLN

We must try to be happier. We

must. Both of us. We've been so

miserable for so long.

LINCOLN

I did say some colored men, the

intelligent, the educated, and

veterans, I qualified it.

JAMES ASHLEY

Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to

know why you qualified it -

SCHUYLER COLFAX

No one heard the intelligent or the

educated part. All they heard was

the first time any president has

ever made mention of Negro voting.

LINCOLN

Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a

better speech.

JAMES ASHLEY

Mr. Stevens also wants to know why

you didn't make a better speech.

123.

JOHN NICOLAY

(TO LINCOLN:)

Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the

carriage. She wants me to remind

you of the hour, and that you'll

have to pick up Miss Harris and

Major Rathbone.

LINCOLN

Am I in trouble?

WILLIAM SLADE

No, sir.

LINCOLN

Thank you, Mr. Slade.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

I suppose it's time to go, though I

would rather stay.

CONTINUOUS

124.

LEONARD GROVER

(VOICE SHAKING:)

The President has been shot.

LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D)

The President has been shot at

Ford's Theater!

125.

DR. BARNES

It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday

the 15th of April. It's all over.

The President is no more.

STANTON

Now he belongs to the ages.

LINCOLN (V.O.)

Fondly do we hope, fervently do we

pray, that this mighty scourge of

war may speedily pass away.

LINCOLN

Yet, if God wills that it continue

until all the wealth piled by the

bondman's two hundred and fifty

years of unrequited toil shall be

sunk, and until every drop of blood

drawn with the lash shall be paid

by another drawn with the sword, as

was said three thousand years ago,

so still it must be said "the

judgments of the Lord are true and

righteous altogether."

126.

LINCOLN (CONT'D)

With malice toward none, with

charity for all, with firmness in

the right as God gives us to see

the right, let us strive on to

finish the work we are in, to bind

up the nation's wounds, to care for

him who shall have borne the

battle, and for his widow and his

orphan, to do all which may achieve

and cherish a just and a lasting

peace among ourselves and with all

nations.

FADE TO BLACK.
