MOTHER

Now remember, keep your shoulders back.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Okay, put your arm around your brother.

That's it. And breathe in.

PHOTOGRAPHR

Okay, one more.

TEACHER

Now just to review, you're going to

follow along the procession until you

get to the headmaster. At that point

he will indicate to you to light the

candles of the boys.

MAN

All right boys, let's settle down.

MAN

Banners up.

MR NOLAN

Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light

of knowledge.

MR NOLAN

One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this

room and were asked the same question that greets

you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what

are the four pillars?

BOYS

Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

MR NOLAN

In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five

students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And

more than seventy-five percent of those went on to

the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is

the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught

here. This is why you parents have been sending us

your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory

school in the United States.

MR NOLAN

As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English

department retired last term. You will have the

opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John

Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,

for the past several years, has been teaching at the

highly regarded Chester School in London.

MR NOLAN

Glad you could come by.

MR ANDERSON

Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

MR NOLAN

You've been away too long.

MRS ANDERSON

Hello Dr. Nolan.

MR NOLAN

Good to have you back.

MRS ANDERSON

This is our youngest, Todd.

MR NOLAN

Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,

young man. Your brother was one of our finest.

TODD

Thank you.

WOMAN

Lovely ceremony.

MR NOLAN

Thank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY

Gale

MR NOLAN

Tom

MR PERRY

Good to see you again.

NEIL

Hello Mr. Nolan.

MR NOLAN

Neil. We expect great things from you this year.

NEIL

Thank you, sir.

MR PERRY

Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

NEIL

I'll do my best sir.

FATHER

Hey, come on son.

MOTHER

Chin up.

FATHER

No tears now.

BOY

Okay.

MOTHER

Chin up.

BOY

I don't want to go here.

MOTHER

You be a good boy and do your lessons.

NEIL

Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

NEIL

I'm Neil Perry.

TODD

Todd Anderson.

NEIL

Why'd you leave Balincrest?

TODD

My brother went here.

NEIL

Oh, so you're that Anderson.

FATHER

This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you

give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing

you can give him some of those.

HAGER

All right fine.

FATHER

(to son)

Did you remember your vaporizer?

SPAZ

Yes, I put it in my room.

KNOX

Hey, how's it going Neil?

NEIL

Hey Knox.

CAMERON

Neil, study group tonight?

NEIL

Yeah, sure.

CAMERON

Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new

kid. Looks like a stiff!

CAMERON

Oops!

NEIL

Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his

foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

CHARLIE

Rumor has it, you did summer school.

NEIL

Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.

How was your summer Slick?

CHARLIE

Keen.

CHARLIE

Meeks. Door. Closed.

MEEKS

Yes sir.

NEIL

Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

BOYS

Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

CHARLIE

Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite

flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study

group.

NEIL

Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind

including him?

CHARLIE

Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

NEIL

Come on, he's your roommate.

CHARLIE

That's not my fault.

MEEKS

Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

NEIL

Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

MEEKS

Nice to meet you.

TODD

Nice to meet you.

CHARLIE

Charlie Dalton.

KNOX

Knox Overstreet.

NEIL

Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

CHARLIE

Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.

MEEKS

Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

CHARLIE

It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a

genius like Meeks.

MEEKS

He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

CHARLIE

And English, and Trig.

NEIL

It's open.

NEIL

Father, I thought you'd gone.

BOYS

Mr. Perry.

MR PERRY

Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've

just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking

too many extra curricular activities this semester, and

I've decided that you should drop the school annual.

NEIL

But I'm the assistant editor this year.

MR PERRY

Well I'm sorry Neil.

NEIL

But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

MR PERRY

Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

MR PERRY

Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you

understand?

NEIL

Father, I wasn't disputing-

MR PERRY

NEIL

Yes sir. I'm sorry.

MR PERRY

You know how much this means to your mother,

don't you?

NEIL

Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

MR PERRY

Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,

you let us know, huh?

NEIL

Yes sir.

CHARLIE

Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

KNOX

Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

NEIL

Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.

Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

CHARLIE

Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

NEIL

Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You

guys are the same way.

KNOX

All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

NEIL

What I have to do. Drop the annual.

CHARLIE

Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a

bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

NEIL

I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

MEEKS

Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

NEIL

Yes.

MEEKS

Todd, you're welcome to join us.

KNOX

Yeah, come along pal.

TODD

Thanks.

MCALLISTER

Slow down boys, slow down you horrible

phalanx of pubescense.

TEACHER

Pick three laboratory experiments from

the project list and report on them every

five weeks. The first twenty questions at

the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

MCALLISTER

(students repeat after each word.)

Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.

Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.

Agrilcolis.

Again, please.

Agricola.

HAGER

Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.

Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will

be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge

you now not to test me on this point.

KNOX

Hey Spaz, Spaz.

CAMERON

Brain damage.

KEATING

Well come on.

KEATING

"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where

that comes from?

KEATING

Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt

Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in

this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,

if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,

My Captain.

KEATING

Now let me dispel a few rumors so they

don't fester into facts. Yes, I too

attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,

at that time I was not the mental giant

you see before you. I was the intellectual

equivalent of a ninety-eight pound

weakling. I would go to the beach and

people would kick copies of Byron in my

face.

KEATING

Now, Mr... Pitts. That's a rather

unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are

you?

KEATING

PITTS

"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

KEATING

Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,

isn't it.

PITTS

"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old

time is still a flying, and this same

flower that smiles today, tomorrow will

be dying."

KEATING

Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds

while ye may." The Latin term for that

sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows

what that means?

MEEKS

Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

KEATING

Very good, Mr.-

MEEKS

Meeks.

KEATING

Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the

day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

Why does the writer use these lines?

CHARLIE

Because he's in a hurry.

KEATING

No, ding!

KEATING

Thank you for playing anyway. Because we

are food for worms lads. Because, believe

it or not, each and every one of us in

this room is one day going to stop

breathing, turn cold, and die.

KEATING

Now I would like you to step forward over

here and peruse some of the faces from

the past. You've walked past them many

times. I don't think you've really looked

at them.

KEATING

They're not that different from you, are

they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,

just like you. Invincible, just like you

feel. The world is their oyster. They

believe they're destined for great things,

just like many of you. Their eyes are full

of hope, just like you. Did they wait until

it was too late to make from their lives

even one iota of what they were capable?

Because you see gentlmen, these boys are

now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen

real close, you can hear them whisper their

legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

KEATING

(whispering in a gruff voice)

Carpe.

KEATING

Hear it?

(whispering again)

Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,

make your lives extraordinary.

PITTS

That was weird.

NEIL

But different.

KNOX

Spooky if you ask me.

CAMERON

Think he'll test us on that stuff?

CHARLIE

Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?

CAMERON

What? What?

COACH

Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That

means you Dalton.

MEEKS

Okay, who's up for a trig study group

tonight guys?

PITTS

Me.

NEIL

Me.

CHARLIE

(still annoyed by what the coach said)

What?

KNOX

I can't make it guys. I have to have

dinner at the Danburry's house.

PITTS

The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

CAMERON

Big alumns. How'd you swing that?

KNOX

Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in

their nineties or something.

CHARLIE

Ooh!

NEIL

Anything's better than Hell-ton hash.

CHARLIE

I'll second that.

KNOX

Yeah we'll see.

NEIL

Hey, you coming to the study group tonight?

TODD

Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I

wanna do.

NEIL

Suit yourself.

HAGER

Ready Overstreet?

KNOX

Ready to go sir.

MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)

Chet, can you get that?

CHET (O.S.)

I can't, Mom.

CHRIS (O.S.)

I'll get it.

CHRIS

Can I help you?

KNOX

Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

CHRIS

Hi.

KNOX

This is the Danburry's, right?

CHRIS

Are you here to see Chet?

KNOX

Mrs. Danburry?

CHRIS

No.

MRS DANBURRY

Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.

You must be Knox.

KNOX

Yes.

MRS DANBURRY

(to Dr. Hager)

Back by nine.

(to Knox)

Please come in.

CHET (O.S.)

Chris, come on, what are you doing?

CHRIS

Chet, I'm coming.

MR DANBURRY

Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

KNOX

Nice to meet you sir.

MR DANBURRY

Well he's the spitting image of his father,

isn't he. How is he? Come on in.

CHET (O.S.)

Chris!

KNOX

He's great. He just did a big case for GM.

CHRIS (O.S.)

I'm coming.

MR DANBURRY

I know where you're headed, like father

like son, huh?

CAMERON

Just replace these numbers here with "x",

for "x" and "y".

NEIL

Of course.

CAMERON

Of course, so what's the problem?

CHARLIE

How was dinner?

KNOX

Huh?

CHARLIE

How was dinner?

KNOX

Terrible. Awful.

CHARLIE

Why? What happened?

KNOX

Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl

in my entire life.

NEIL

Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

KNOX

She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

CHARLIE

That guy could eat a football.

PITTS

That's too bad.

KNOX

Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,

it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in

love with such a jerk.

PITTS

All the good ones go for jerks, you

know that.

CAMERON

Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and

try and figure out problem five.

KNOX

I can't just forget her Cameron. And I

can't think about trig.

PITTS

We got it.

MEEKS

Holy cow.

HAGER

All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's

go.

CHARLIE

Did you see her naked?

KNOX

Very funny Dalton.

HAGER

That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,

would it Mr. Pitts?

PITTS

No sir. Science experiment, radar.

KEATING

Gentlemen, open your text to page

twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.

Perry, will you read the opening

paragraph of the preface, entitled

"Understanding Poetry"?

NEIL

Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans

Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand

poetry, we must first be fluent with

its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.

Then ask two questions: One, how artfully

has the objective of the poem been

rendered, and two, how important is that

objective. Question one rates the poem's

perfection, question two rates its

importance. And once these questions have

been answered, determining a poem's

greatest becomes a relatively simple

matter.

NEIL

If the poem's score for perfection is

plotted along the horizontal of a graph,

and its importance is plotted on the

vertical, then calculating the total

area of the poem yields the measure of

its greatness.

NEIL

A sonnet by Byron may score high on the

vertical, but only average on the

horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on

the other hand, would score high both

horizontally and vertically, yielding a

massive total area, thereby revealing the

poem to be truly great. As you proceed

through the poetry in this book, practice

this rating method. As your ability to

evaluate poems in this matter grows, so

will - so will your enjoyment and

understanding of poetry.

KEATING

Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.

Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,

we're talking about poetry.

KEATING

I mean, how can you describe poetry like

American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give

him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

KEATING

Now I want you to rip out that page.

KEATING

Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard

me, rip it out. Rip it out!

KEATING

Go on, rip it out.

KEATING

Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you

what, don't just tear out that page, tear

out the entire introduction. I want it

gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip

it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,

Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I

want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.

Pritchard.

KEATING

We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

KEATING

It's not the bible, you're not going to

go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean

tear, I want nothing left of it.

CAMERON

We shouldn't be doing this.

NEIL

Rip, rip, rip!

KEATING (O.S.)

Rip it out, rip!

MCALLISTER

What the hell is going on here?

KEATING

I don't hear enough rips.

MCALLISTER

Mr. Keating.

KEATING

Mr. McAllister.

MCALLISTER

I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were

here.

KEATING

I am.

MCALLISTER

Ahh, so you are. Excuse me.

KEATING

Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,

a war. And the casualties could be your

hearts and souls.

KEATING

Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics

going forward, measuring poetry. No, we

will not have that here. No more of Mr.

J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you

will learn to think for yourselves again.

You will learn to savor words and language.

No matter what anybody tells you, words and

ideas can change the world. I see that look

in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century

literature has nothing to do with going to

business school or medical school. Right?

Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him,

thinking "Yes, we should simply study our

Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter

and go quietly about the business of

achieving other ambitions." I have a little

secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up!

KEATING

We don't read and write poetry because

it's cute. We read and write poetry

because we are members of the human race.

And the human race is filled with passion.

Medicine, law, business, engineering,

these are all noble pursuits, and necessary

to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,

romance, love, these are what we stay alive

for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life

of the questions of these recurring, of the

endless trains of the faithless, of cities

filled with the foolish. What good amid

these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are

here. That life exists, and identity.

That the powerful play goes on, and you

may contribute a verse. That the powerful

play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating

What will your verse be?

ALL

For what we are about to receive, may the

Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

MCALLISTER

Quite an interesting class you gave today,

Mr. Keating.

KEATING

I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

MCALLISTER

Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was

very fascinating, misguided though it was.

KEATING

You think so?

MCALLISTER

You take a big risk by encouraging them to

be artists John. When they realize they're

not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

they'll hate you for it.

KEATING

We're not talking artists George, we're

talking free thinkers.

MCALLISTER

Free thinkers at seventeen?

KEATING

Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

MCALLISTER

(taken aback by the comment)

Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart

unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll

show you a happy man.

KEATING

But only in their dreams can man be truly

free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus

will be.

MCALLISTER

Tennyson?

KEATING

No, Keating.

NEIL

Hey, I found his senior annual in the

library.

NEIL

Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,

editor of the school annual, Cambridge

bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

CAMERON

(reading from the annual)

Man most likely to do anything.

CHARLIE

Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

KNOX

What's the Dead Poets Society?

NEIL

I don't know.

MEEKS

Is there a picture in the annual?

NEIL

Nothing. No other mention of it.

MR. NOLAN (O.S.)

That boy there, see me after lunch.

NEIL

Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,

My Captain?

KEATING

Gentlemen.

NEIL

We were just looking in your old annual.

KEATING

Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley

"The Tool" Wilson-

KEATING

God.

NEIL

What was the Dead Poets Society?

KEATING

I doubt the present administration would

look too favorably upon that.

NEIL

Why? What was it?

KEATING

Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

NEIL

Sure.

KEATING

The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking

the marrow out of life. That's a phrase

from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the

beginning of each meeting. You see we'd

gather at the old Indian cave and take

turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,

Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our

own verse. And in the enchantment of the

moment we'd let poetry work its magic.

KNOX

You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting

around reading poetry?

KEATING

No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",

we weren't a Greek organization, we were

romantics. We didn't just read poetry,

we let it drip from our tongues like honey.

Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods

were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to

spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry

for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,

especially my picture.

NEIL

Dead Poets Society.

CAMERON

What?

NEIL

I say we go tonight.

CHARLIE

Tonight?

CAMERON

Wait a minute.

PITTS

Where's this cave he's talking about?

NEIL

It's beyond the stream. I know where it

is.

PITTS

That's miles.

CAMERON

Sounds boring to me.

CHARLIE

Don't go.

CAMERON

You know how many de-merits we're talking

Dalton

CHARLIE

So don't come, please.

CAMERON

Look, all I'm saying is that we have to

be careful, we can't get caught.

CHARLIE

No shit, Sherlock.

HAGER

(yelling)

You boys there, hurry up.

NEIL

All right, who's in?

CAMERON

Come on Neil, Hager's right-

NEIL

Forget Hager, no. Who's in?

CHARLIE

I'm in.

HAGER (O.S.)

I'm warning you, move.

CAMERON

Me too.

PITTS

I don't know Neil

NEIL

What? Pitts-

CHARLIE

Pitsie, come on.

MEEKS

His grades are hurting Charlie.

NEIL

You can help him Meeks.

PITTS

What is this, a midnight study group?

NEIL

Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,

are your grades hurting too?

MEEKS

I'll try anything once.

CHARLIE

Except sex.

MEEKS

Ha ha ha.

CAMERON

I mean as long as we're careful.

CHARLIE

What about you Knox?

KNOX

I don't know Charlie.

CHARLIE

Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

KNOX

Yeah? How?

CHARLIE

Women swoon.

KNOX

But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me

why they swoon. Charlie!

NEIL

(whispering)

Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.

It's right there. It's got to be on the

banks.

CAMERON

I don't know, it's starting to sound

dangerous.

CHARLIE

Well, why don't you stay home?

MCALLISTER

For God's sake stop chattering and

sit down.

NEIL

Todd, are you coming tonight?

TODD

No.

NEIL

Why not? God, you were there. You heard

Keating. Don't you want to do something

about it?

TODD

Yes, but-

NEIL

But? But what?

TODD

Keating said that everybody took turns

reading and I don't want to do that.

NEIL

Gosh, you really have a problem with

that, don't you?

TODD

N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,

I just- I just don't want to do it,

okay?

NEIL

All right. What if you didn't have to

read? What if you just came and

listened?

TODD

That's not how it works.

NEIL

Forget how it works. What if - what if

they said it was okay?

TODD

What? What are you gonna do, go up and

ask them?

TODD

No. No, Neil.

NEIL

I'll be right back.

TODD

Neil, Neil!

MCALLISTER

Oh shut up, will you.

SPAZ

That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.

Could you give that back please? Could

you give that back?

BOY

What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

NEIL

You're in.

SPAZ

Get away from me, okay?

BOY

Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,

huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my

teeth

SPAZ

Get a- get off,

HAGER

Cut out that racket in there.

CHARLIE

Arrr, I'm a dead poet.

MEEKS

Aww, Charlie.

CHARLIE

(laughing)

Guys, over here.

MEEKS

You're funny. You're real funny.

MEEKS

It's too wet.

God, are you trying to smoke us out of

here?

MEEKS

No, no, the smoke's going right up this

opening.

NEIL

You okay?

PITTS

Oh God. Clowns.

NEIL

All right, all right, forget the fire.

Let's go gentlemen.

NEIL

I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets

Society.

NEIL

Welton chapter. The meetings will be

conducted by myself and the other new

initiates now present. Todd Anderson,

because he prefers not to read, will

keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now

read the traditional opening message by

society member Henry David Thoreau. "I

went to the woods because I wanted to

live deliberately. I wanted to live deep

and suck out all the marrow of life."

CHARLIE

I'll second that.

NEIL

"To put to rout all that was not life,

and not, when I had come to die,

discover that I had not lived.

NEIL

And Keating's marked a bunch of other

pages.

CHARLIE

All right, intermission. Dig deep right

here. Right here, lay it down

CAMERON

On the mud? We're gonna put our food on

the mud?

CHARLIE

Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

MEEKS

Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.

CHARLIE

Don't keep anything back either. You

guys are always bumming my smokes.

NEIL

Raisins?

KNOX

Yuck.

CHARLIE

Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

PITTS

(talking with his mouth full)

I'm eating the other half.

CHARLIE

Come on.

PITTS

You want me to put it back?

NEIL

It was a dark and rainy night, and this

old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw

puzzles, sat by herself in her house at

her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

But as she pieced the puzzle together, she

realized, to her astonishment, that the

image that was formed was her very own

room. And the figure in the center of the

puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.

And with trembling hands, she placed the

last four pieces and stared in horror at

the face of a demented madman at the

window. The last thing that this old lady

ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

BOYS

Ohhh... no...

NEIL

This is true, this is true.

CAMERON

I've got one that's even better than

that.

CHARLIE

Ha!

CAMERON

I do. There's a young, married couple,

and they're driving through the forest

at night on a long trip. And they run

out of gas, and there's a madman on the-

CHARLIE

The thing with the hand-

CAMERON

I love that story.

CHARLIE

I told you that one.

CAMERON

You did not. I got that in camp in

sixth grade.

CHARLIE

When were you in six, last year?

PITTS

"In a mean abode in the shanking road,

lived a man named William Bloat. Now,

he had a wife, the plague of his life,

who continually got his goat. And one

day at dawn, with her nightshift on,

he slit her bloody throat."

PITTS

Oh, and it gets worse.

CHARLIE

You want to hear a real poem?

CHARLIE

All right? No, I don't need it. You take

it.

MEEKS

What, did you bring one?

NEIL

You memorized a poem?

CHARLIE

I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

MEEKS

An original piece by Charlie Dalton.

KNOX

An original piece.

PITTS

Take center stage.

NEIL

You know this is history. Right? This is

history.

MEEKS

Oh, wow.

CAMERON

Where did you get that?

CHARLIE

Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more

wit.

I, chief professor, am of it.

CHARLIE

The god of love, if such a thing there

be, may learn to love from me.

NEIL

Wow! Did you write that?

CHARLIE

Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next?

NEIL

Alfred Lord Tennyson.

Come my friends,

'Tis not too late to seek a newer world

for my purpose holds to sail beyond the

sunset.

And though we are not now that strength

which in old days

Moved earth and heaven; that which we

are, we are;--

One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong

in will.

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to

yield.

MEEKS

Then I had religion, then I had a

vision.

I could not turn from their revel in

derision.

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black,

cutting through the forest with a golden

track.

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black-

CHARLIE

Meeks, Meeks.

MEEKS

...cutting through the forest with a

golden track.

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black,

cutting through the forest with a golden

track.

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black,

cutting through the forest with a golden

track.

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black,

cutting through the forest with a golden

track.

BOYS

Then I saw the Congo creeping through

the black,

cutting through the forest with...

KEATING

A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.

And don't use very sad, use-

KEATING

Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp,

KNOX

Morose?

KEATING

Exactly! Morose. Now, language was

developed for one endeavor, and that is?

Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or

an amoeba?

KEATING

Mr. Perry?

NEIL

Uh, to communicate.

KEATING

No! To woo women. Today we're going to

be talking about William Shakespeare.

BOY

Oh, God!

KEATING

I know. A lot of you looked forward to

this about as much as you look forward

to root canal work. We're gonna talk

about Shakespeare as someone who writes

something very interesting. Now, many of

you have seen Shakespeare done very much

like this:

"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But

if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,

you know, Shakespeare can be different.

"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your

ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John

Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a

dagger I see before me?"

KEATING

"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy

a good dog once in a while, sir. You can

have yourself a three-course meal from

one dog. Start with your canine

crudites, go to your Fido flambe for

main course and for dessert, a Pekingese

parfait. And you can pick your teeth

with a little paw."

KEATING

Why do I stand up here? Anybody?

CHARLIE

To feel taller.

KEATING

No!

KEATING

Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I

stand upon my desk to remind yourself

that we must constantly look at things

in a different way.

KEATING

You see, the world looks very different

from up here. You don't believe me? Come

see for yourself. Come on. Come on!

KEATING

Just when you think you know something,

you have to look at it in another way.

Even though it may seem silly or wrong,

you must try! Now, when you read, don't

just consider what the author thinks.

Consider what you think.

KEATING

Boys, you must strive to find your own

voice. Because the longer you wait to

begin, the less likely you are to find

it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead

lives of quiet desperation." Don't be

resigned to that. Break out!

KEATING

Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.

Look around you.

KEATING

There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank

you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find

new ground. Now, in addition to your

essays, I would like you to compose a

poem of your own, an original work.

KEATING

That's right! You have to deliver it

aloud in front of the class on Monday.

Bonne chance, gentlemen.

KEATING

Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't

know that this assignment scares the

hell out of you, you mole.

MR. NOLAN

Take a power train in two! Three! Keep

your eyes in the boat!

MEEKS

We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio

Free America!

NEIL

I found it.

TODD

You found what?

NEIL

What I wanna do right now. What's

really, really inside me.

TODD

"A Midsummer Night's Dream"?

NEIL

This is it.

TODD

What is this?

NEIL

It's a play, dummy.

TODD

I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have

to do with you?

NEIL

Right. They're putting it on at Henley

Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!

TODD

Yes, so?

NEIL

So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna

be an actor! Ever since I can remember,

I've wanted to try this. I even tried to

go to summer stock auditions last year,

but, of course, my father wouldn't let

me. For the first time in my whole life

I know what I wanna do.

NEIL

and for the first time I'm gonna do it

whether my father wants me to or not!

Carpe diem!

TODD

Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are

you gonna be in a play if your father

won't let you?

NEIL

First I gotta get the part, then I can

worry about that.

TODD

Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds

out you went to an audition and didn't

even tell him?

NEIL

No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned,

he won't have to know about any of this.

TODD

Well, that's impossible.

NEIL

Bullshit! Nothing's impossible.

TODD

Well, why don't you just call him and

ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.

NEIL

That's a laugh!

NEIL

If I don't ask him, at least I won't

be disobeying him.

TODD

Yeah, but if he said--

NEIL

(shouting angrily)

Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

NEIL

I mean, I haven't even gotten the part

yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a

little while?

NEIL

You're coming to the meeting this

afternoon?

TODD

I don't know. Maybe.

NEIL

Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means

shit to you, does it, Todd?

TODD

W-What is that supposed to mean?

NEIL

You're in the club! Being in the club

means being stirred up by things. You

look about as stirred up as a cesspool.

TODD

So- You want me out?

NEIL

No! I want you in, but being in means

you gotta do something. Not just say

you're in.

TODD

Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this

concern, but I-I'm not like you. All

right? You, you, you say thing and

people listen. I'm, I'm not like that.

NEIL

Don't you think you could be?

TODD

No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not

the point. The, the, the point is that

there's nothing you can do about it, so

you can just butt out. I can take care

of myself just fine. All right?

NEIL

No.

TODD

What do you mean, "no"?

NEIL

No.

TODD

Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back.

NEIL

"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm

being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay,

okay.

CAMERON

What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You

see this chemistry-

CAMERON

Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be

immature. Come on. I need my-

CHARLIE

Give it to me! Give it to me!

NEIL

Charlie!

CAMERON

Let me have my book, I need my-

COACH

Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go,

boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus,

boys. Now!

KEATING

Now, devotees may argue that one sport

or game is inherently better than

another. For me, sport is actually a

chance for us to have other human beings

push us to excel. I want you all to come

over here and take a slip of paper and

line up single file.

KEATING

Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.

Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

KEATING

I want you to hand these out to the boys,

one apiece.

KEATING

You know what to do, Pitts.

PITTS

"Oh to struggle against great odds. To

meet enemies undaunted."

KEATING

Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it

again like you're undaunted.

PITTS

"Oh to struggle against great odds. To

meet enemies undaunted."

KEATING

Now go on.

KEATING

Yes! Next.

BOY 1

"To be a sailor of the world, bound for

all ports."

KEATING

Next. Louder!

BOY 2

"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not

a slave."

BOY 3

"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to

the muzzle of guns with perfect

nonchalance."

KEATING

Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music.

MEEKS

"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout,

skip, roll on, float on."

KEATING

Yes!

HOPKINS

(without energy)

"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of

new joys."

KEATING

Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill

your soul!

CHARLIE

"To indeed be a god!"

NEIL

Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play

Puck! I'm gonna play Puck!

MEEKS

What did he say?

PITTS

Puck?

NEIL

That's the main part.

KNOX

Great, Neil.

NEIL

Charlie, I got it!

CHARLIE

Congratulations. Good for you, Neil.

Good for you.

NEIL

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

TODD

Neil, how are you gonna do this?

NEIL

They need a letter of permission from my

father and Mr. Nolan.

TODD

You're not gonna write it.

NEIL

Oh yes, I am.

TODD

Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy.

Neil begins typing.

NEIL

Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of

my son Neil Perry."

NEIL

This is great.

KNOX

(quietly)

"To Chris."

BOY 1

Who's Chris?

BOY 2

Mmm, Chris.

KNOX

I see a sweetness in her smile.

Blight light shines from her eyes.

But life is complete; contentment is

mine,

Just knowing that...

KNOX

just knowing that she's alive.

KNOX

Sorry, Captain. It's stupid.

KEATING

No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good

effort. It touched on one of the major

themes, love. A major theme not only in

poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were

laughing. You're up.

HOPKINS

"The cat sat on the mat."

KEATING

Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is

the first poem to ever have a negative

score on the Pritchard scale. We're not

laughing at you, we're laughing near

you. I don't mind that your poem had a

simple theme. Sometimes the most

beautiful poetry can be about simple

things, like a cat, or a flower or rain.

You see, poetry can come from anything

with the stuff of revelation in it. Just

don't let your poems be ordinary. Now,

who's next?

KEATING

Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in

agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put

you out of your misery.

TODD

I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a

poem.

KEATING

Mr. Anderson thinks that everything

inside of him is worthless and

embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd?

Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I

think you're wrong. I think you have

something inside of you that is worth a

great deal.

KEATING

"I sound my barbaric yawp over the

rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt

again. Now, for those of you who don't

know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now,

Todd, I would like you to give us a

demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come

on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's

go. Come on. Up.

KEATING

You gotta get in "yawping" stance.

TODD

A yawp?

KEATING

No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.

TODD

(quietly)

Yawp.

KEATING

Come on, louder.

TODD

(quietly)

Yawp.

KEATING

No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder.

TODD

Yawp.

KEATING

Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man!

TODD

(shouting)

Yawp!

KEATING

There it is. You see, you have a

barbarian in you, after all.

KEATING

Now, you don't get away that easy.

KEATING

The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What

does he remind you of? Don't think.

Answer. Go on.

TODD

A m-m-madman.

KEATING

What kind of madman? Don't think about

it. Just answer again.

TODD

A c-crazy madman.

KEATING

No, you can do better than that. Free up

your mind. Use your imagination. Say the

first thing that pops into your head,

even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go

on.

TODD

Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.

KEATING

Good God, boy, there's a poet in you,

after all. There, close your eyes. Close

your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what

you see.

TODD

Uh, I-I close my eyes.

KEATING

Yes?

TODD

Uh, and this image floats beside me.

KEATING

A sweaty-toothed madman?

TODD

A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare

that pounds my brain.

KEATING

Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him

action. Make him do something.

TODD

H-His hands reach out and choke me.

KEATING

That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

TODD

And, and all the time he's mumbling.

KEATING

What's he mumbling?

TODD

M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like

a blanket that always leaves your feet

cold."

KEATING

Forget them, forget them. Stay with the

blanket. Tell me about that blanket.

TODD

Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll

never be enough. You kick at it, beat

it, it'll never cover any of us. From

the moment we enter crying to the moment

we leave dying, it will just cover your

face as you wail and cry and scream.

KEATING

(whispering to Todd)

Don't you forget this.

CHARLIE

Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.

MEEKS

My dad collects a lot of pipes.

CHARLIE

Really? Mine's got thirty.

PITTS

Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's

really interesting.

CHARLIE

Come on, Knox. Join in.

MEEKS

Yeah, Knox, we're from the government.

We're here to help, man.

CHARLIE

What's wrong?

PITTS

It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris

for you.

MEEKS

Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and

smoke it.

KNOX

That's not funny.

CHARLIE

Knock it off. Smoke your pipes.

MEEKS

Neil!

NEIL

Friend, scholar, Welton men.

MEEKS

What is that, Neil?

PITTS

Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

NEIL

No. This is the god of the cave.

MEEKS

The god of the cave.

PITTS

Charlie, what are you doing?

CHARLIE

What do you say we start this meeting?

BOY 1

Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just

gotta-

BOY 2

Got my earplugs?

CHARLIE

Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles

Dalton.

MEEKS

Oh, no.

CHARLIE

Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.

Gotta do more. Gotta be more.

CHARLIE

Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta

do more! Gotta be more!

MEEKS

Wow!

PITTS

That was nice. That was great. Where did

you learn to play like that?

CHARLIE

My parents made me take the clarinet for

years.

CAMERON

I love the clarinet.

CHARLIE

I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone

is more sonorous.

CAMERON

Ooh.

MEEKS

Vocabulary.

KNOX

I can't take it anymore. If I don't have

Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.

CHARLIE

Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.

KNOX

No, Charlie. That's just my problem.

I've been calm all my life. I'll do

something about that.

NEIL

Where are you going?

CHARLIE

What are you gonna do?

KNOX

I'm gonna call her.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Hello?

KNOX

She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will

hate me. My parents will kill me.

All right, goddamn it. You're right.

"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Hello?

KNOX

Hello, Chris?

CHRIS (O.S.)

Yes.

KNOX

Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called.

KNOX

She's glad I called.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Listen, Chet's parents are going out of

town this weekend, so he's having a

party. Would you like to come?

KNOX

Would I like to come to a party?

CHARLIE

Yes. Say, yes.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Friday? Um-

KNOX

Well, sure.

CHRIS (O.S.)

About seven?

KNOX

Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Okay.

KNOX

Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay.

Thank you.

CHRIS (O.S.)

Okay. Bye.

KNOX

Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

KNOX

Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna

call me. She invited me to a party with

her.

CHARLIE

At Chet Danburry's house.

KNOX

Yeah.

CHARLIE

Well?

KNOX

So?

CHARLIE

So, you don't really think she means

you're going with her?

KNOX

Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's

not the point. That's not the point at

all.

CHARLIE

What is the point?

KNOX

The point, Charlie, is, uh--

CHARLIE

Yeah?

KNOX

that she was thinking about me. I've

only met her once, and already she's

thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna

happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to

be mine. Carpe. Carpe!

KEATING

No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take

a stroll.

KEATING

There it is.

KEATING

I don't know, but I've been told--

BOYS

I don't know, but I've been told--

KEATING

Doing poetry is old--

BOYS

Doing poetry is old--

KEATING

Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left,

left-right-left. Left, halt!

KEATING

Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed,

everyone started off with their own

stride, their own pace.

KEATING

Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll

get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could

see him thinking, "Is this right? It might

be right. It might be right. I know that.

Maybe not. I don't know."

KEATING

Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.

Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I

didn't bring them up here to ridicule

them. I brought them up here to illustrate

the point of conformity: the difficulty in

maintaining your own beliefs in the face

of others. Now, those of you -- I see

the look in your eyes like, "I would've

walked differently." Well, ask

yourselves why you were clapping. Now,

we all have a great need for acceptance.

But you must trust that your beliefs are

unique, your own, even though others may

think them odd or unpopular, even though

the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert

Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a

wood and I, I took the one less traveled

by, and that has made all the

difference." Now, I want you to find

your own walk right now. Your own way of

striding, pacing. Any direction.

Anything you want. Whether it's proud,

whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen,

the courtyard is yours.

KEATING

You don't have to perform. Just make it

for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining

us?

CHARLIE

Exercising the right not to walk.

KEATING

Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just

illustrated the point. Swim against the

stream.

NEIL

Todd? Hey.

TODD

Hey.

NEIL

What's going on?

TODD

Nothing. Today's my birthday.

NEIL

Is today your birthday? Happy birthday.

TODD

Thanks.

NEIL

What's you get?

TODD

My parents gave me this.

NEIL

Isn't this the same desk set-

TODD

Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing

as last year.

NEIL

Oh.

TODD

Oh.

NEIL

(laughing)

Maybe they thought you needed another

one.

TODD

Maybe they weren't thinking about

anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is

about this is I, I didn't even like it

the first time.

NEIL

Todd, I think you're underestimating the

value of this desk set.

NEIL

I mean, who would want a football or

a baseball, or-

TODD

Or a car.

NEIL

Or a car if they could have a desk set

as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if

I were ever going to buy a, a desk set

twice, I would probably buy this one

both times. In fact, its, its shape is,

it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can

feel it. This desk set wants to fly.

NEIL

Todd? The world's first unmanned flying

desk set.

TODD

Oh, my!

NEIL

Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get

another one next year.

BOYS

"To live deep and suck out all the

marrow of life. To put to rout all that

was not life"

CAMERON

Oh, my God!

GLORIA

Is this it?

CHARLIE

Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in.

It's my cave. Watch your step.

TINA

We're not gonna slip, are we?

GLORIA

Uh-oh.

GLORIA

Hi.

MEEKS

Hello.

GLORIA

Hello.

CHARLIE

Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and--

TINA

Tina.

CHARLIE

Tina. This is the pledge class of the

Dead Poets Society.

BOYS

Hello. How do you do?

NEIL

Hello.

GLORIA

Hi. Hi.

CHARLIE

Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's

Friday night. Let's get on with the

meeting.

BOYS

Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me.

CHARLIE

Guys, I have an announcement to make. In

keeping with the spirit of passionate

experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm

giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From

now on, call me Nuwanda.

PITTS

(laughing)

Nuwanda?

NEIL

Nuwanda?

KNOX

Hello? Hello, Chris?

CHRIS

Knox!

KNOX

Hi.

CHRIS

You made it. Great! Bring anybody?

KNOX

No.

CHRIS

No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have

to go find Chet. Why don't you go

downstairs where everybody is?

CHRIS

Make yourself at home.

KNOX

But I--

STEVE

Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba,

this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you

or what?

BUBBA

You're his brother?

KNOX

No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry,

guys.

BUBBA

(obviously drunk)

Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders'

brother, we don't even offer him a

drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal.

STEVE

Yeah.

KNOX

Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink--

BUBBA

To Mutt.

STEVE

To Mutt.

KNOX

To Mutt.

BUBBA

Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway?

STEVE

Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh?

KNOX

I don't really know Mutt.

BUBBA

To Mighty Mutt.

GUY 1

To Mighty Mutt.

KNOX

To Mighty Mutt.

BUBBA

Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say

hello to Mutt for me, okay?

KNOX

Will do.

STEVE

Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

CHARLIE

We gonna have a meeting or what?

GLORIA

Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting,

how do we know if we wanna join?

NEIL

Join?

CHARLIE

"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

Thou art more lovely and more

temperate."

TINA

That's so sweet.

CHARLIE

I made that up just for you.

TINA

You did?

CHARLIE

I'll write one for you too, Gloria.

She walks in beauty like the night.

She walks in beauty like the night.

Of cloudless climes and starry skies.

All that's best, dark and bright,

Meet in her aspect and her eyes.

GLORIA

That's beautiful.

CHARLIE

There's plenty more where that came

from.

KNOX

God help me.

KNOX

Carpe diem.

BUBBA

Chet! Chet! Look!

CHET

What?

BUBBA

It's Mutt Sanders' brother.

CHET

Huh?

CHRIS

Knox, what--

BUBBA

And he's feeling up your girl!

CHRIS

What are you doing?

CHET

What the hell are you doing?

CHRIS

Chet! Chet, don't.

KNOX

Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but

you've gotta-

CHRIS

Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop

it! Leave him alone!

CHET

Goddamn!

CHRIS

Chet, stop it!

CHET

Bastard!

CHRIS

Knox, are you all right?

CHET

Chris, get the hell away from him!

CHRIS

Chet, you hurt him!

CHET

Good!

KNOX

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

CHRIS

It's okay. It-It's okay.

CHET

Next time I see you, you die.

TINA

Go ahead, pass it around.

MEEKS

Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi

system. It shouldn't be that hard to,

uh, to put together.

PITTS

Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh,

uh, but, I, I might not.

GLORIA

Don't you guys miss having girls around

here?

MEEKS AND PITTS

(smiling)

Yeah.

CHARLIE

That's part of what this club is about.

In fact, I'd like to announce I

published an article in the school

paper, in the name of the Dead Poets.

CAMERON

What?

CHARLIE

Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.

PITTS

You didn't.

CHARLIE

(whispering to Meeks)

So we can all stop beating off.

NEIL

How did you do that?

CHARLIE

I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the

article in.

MEEKS

Look, uh, it's, it's over now.

CHARLIE

Why? Nobody knows who we are.

CAMERON

Well, don't you think they're gonna

figure out who wrote it? They're gonna

come to you and ask to know what the

Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had

no right to do something like that.

CHARLIE

It's Nuwanda, Cameron.

GLORIA

That's right. It's Nuwanda.

CHARLIE

Are we just playing around out here, or

do we mean what we say? For all we do is

come together and reach a bunch of poems

to each other. What the hell are we

doing?

NEIL

All right, but you still shouldn't have

done it, Charlie. This could mean

trouble. You don't speak for the club.

CHARLIE

Hey, would you not worry about your

precious little neck? If they catch me,

I'll tell them I made it up.

MR. NOLAN

Sit.

MR. NOLAN

In this week of Welton's Honor there

appeared a profane and unauthorized

article. Rather than spend my valuable

time ferreting out the guilty persons --

and let me assure you I will find them -

- I'm asking any and all students who

knows anything about this article to

make themselves known here and now.

Whoever the guilty persons are, this is

your only chance to avoid expulsion from

this school.

CHARLIE

Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just

a moment.

CHARLIE

Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's

God. He says we should have girls at

Welton.

MR. NOLAN

Wipe that smirk off your face. If you

think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first

to try to get thrown out of this school,

think again. Others have had similar

notions and have failed just as surely

as you will fail. Assume the position.

MR. NOLAN

Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

CHARLIE

One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

MR. NOLAN

What is this Dead Poets Society? I want

names.

NEIL

You kicked out?

CHARLIE

No.

NEIL

So what happened?

CHARLIE

I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to

the school and all will be forgiven.

NEIL

So, what are you gonna do? Charlie!

CHARLIE

Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

MR. NOLAN

Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr.

Keating?

KEATING

Certainly.

MR. NOLAN

This was my first classroom, John. Did

you know that? My first desk.

KEATING

Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.

MR. NOLAN

English. Oh, long before your time. It

was hard giving it up, I can tell you.

I'm hearing rumors, John, about some

unorthodox teaching methods in your

classroom. I'm not saying they've

anything to do with the Dalton boy's

outburst. But I don't think I have to

warn you boys his age are very

impressionable.

KEATING

Well, your reprimand made quite an

impression, I'm sure.

MR. NOLAN

What was going on in the courtyard the

other day?

KEATING

Courtyard?

MR. NOLAN

Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison.

KEATING

Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove

a point. Dangers of conformity.

MR. NOLAN

Well, John, the curriculum here is set.

It's proven it works. If you question,

what's to prevent them from doing the

same?

KEATING

I always thought the idea of educating

was to learn to think for yourself.

MR. NOLAN

At these boys' ages? Not on your life!

Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare

them for college, and the rest will take

care of itself.

CHARLIE

Creak. He started walking around towards

my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the

position, Mr. Dalton."

KEATING

It's all right, gentlemen.

CHARLIE

Mr. Keating.

KEATING

Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt

you pulled today.

CHARLIE

You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about

Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow

out of life and all that?

KEATING

Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't

mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a

time for daring and there's a time for

caution, and a wise man understands

which is called for.

CHARLIE

But I thought you'd like that.

KEATING

No. You being expelled from school is

not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause

you'll miss some golden opportunities.

CHARLIE

Yeah. Like what?

KEATING

Like, if nothing else, the opportunity

to attend my classes. Got it, Ace?

CHARLIE

Aye, aye, Captain.

KEATING

Keep your head about you. That goes for

the lot of you.

BOYS

Yes, Captain.

KEATING

Phone call from God. If it had been

collect, it wouldn't been daring.

CHARLIE

All right. Go on.

DIRECTOR

We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start.

LYSANDER

A good persuasion, therefore hear me,

Hermia.

DIRECTOR

Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear

any excitement about this play. And take

her hand. Bring her down the stage and

stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay?

Try again.

BOY

What's for dinner?

PITTS

Spaghetti and meatballs!

NEIL

Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy!

Here comes Oberon."

NEIL

Father.

MR. PERRY

Neil.

NEIL

Wait a minute. Before you say anything,

please let me ex-

MR. PERRY

Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad

enough that you've wasted your time with

this, this absurd acting business. But

you deliberately deceived me! How, how,

how did you expect to get away with

this? Answer me. Who put you up to it?

Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr.

Keating?

NEIL

No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you.

I've gotten all A's in every class.

MR. PERRY

Did you think I wasn't going to find

out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with

your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no,

no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My

son's not in a play." You made me a liar

of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to

them and you tell them that you're

quitting.

NEIL

No, I can't. I have the main part. The

performance is tomorrow night.

MR. PERRY

I don't care if the world comes to an

end tomorrow night. You are through with

that play. Is that clear? Is that clear?

NEIL

Yes, sir.

MR. PERRY

I made a great many sacrifices to get

you here, Neil, and you will not let me

down.

NEIL

No, sir.

KEATING

It's open.

KEATING

Neil, what's up?

NEIL

Can I speak to you a minute?

KEATING

Certainly. Sit down.

NEIL

I'm sorry. Here.

KEATING

Excuse me. Get you some tea?

NEIL

Tea. Sure.

KEATING

Like some milk or sugar in that?

NEIL

No, thanks.

NEIL

Gosh, they don't give you much room

around here.

KEATING

No, it's part of the monastic oath. They

don't want worldly things distracting me

from my teaching.

NEIL

She's pretty.

KEATING

She's also in London. Makes it a little

difficult.

NEIL

How can you stand it?

KEATING

Stand what?

NEIL

You can go anywhere. You can do

anything. How can you stand being here?

KEATING

'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be

anywhere else.

KEATING

What's up?

NEIL

I just talked to my father. He's making

me quit the play at Henley Hall.

Acting's everything to me. I-- But he

doesn't know. He-- I can see his point.

We're not a rich family like Charlie's,

and we-- But he's planning the rest of

my life for me, and I-- H-He's never

asked me what I want.

KEATING

Have you ever told your father what you

just told me? About your passion for

acting. You ever show him that?

NEIL

I can't.

KEATING

Why not?

NEIL

I can't talk to him this way.

KEATING

Then you're acting for him, too. You're

playing the part of the dutiful son. I

know this sounds impossible, but you

have to talk to him. You have to show

him who you are, what your heart is.

NEIL

I know what he'll say. He'll tell me

that acting's a whim, and I should

forget it. That how they're counting on

me. He'll just tell me to put it out of

my mind, "for my own good."

KEATING

You are not an indentured servant. If

it's not a whim for you, you prove it to

him by your conviction and your passion.

You show him that And if he still

doesn't believe you, well, by then

you'll be out of school and you can do

anything you want.

NEIL

No. What about the play? The show's

tomorrow night.

KEATING

Well, you have to talk to him before

tomorrow night.

NEIL

Isn't there an easier way?

KEATING

No.

NEIL

I'm trapped.

KEATING

No, you're not.

KNOX

Chris!

KNOX

Chris Noel. Do you know where she is?

GIRL

Um, I think she's in room 111.

KNOX

Thanks.

KNOX

Excuse me. Chris.

CHRIS

Knox, what are you doing here?

KNOX

I came to apologize for the other night.

I brought you these and a poem I wrote

for you.

CHRIS

Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds

you here he'll kill you?

KNOX

I can't care. I love you, Chris.

CHRIS

Knox, you're crazy.

KNOX

Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it.

Please, accept these. Please.

CHRIS

No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

CHRIS

Knox, I don't believe this.

KNOX

All I'm asking you to do is listen.

KNOX

The heavens made a girl named Chris

With hair and skin of gold.

To touch her would be paradise.

CHARLIE

Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

CHARLIE

Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to

her?

KNOX

Yeah.

PITTS

What'd she say?

KNOX

Nothing.

CHARLIE

Nothing. What do you mean, nothing?

KNOX

Nothing. But I did it.

CHARLIE

What did she say? I know she had to say

something.

PITTS

Come here, Knox.

KNOX

Seize the day!

KEATING

Did you talk to your father?

NEIL

Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at

least he's letting me stay in the play.

He won't be able to make, make it. He's

in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna

let me stay with acting.

KEATING

Really? You told him what you told me?

NEIL

Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone

at least four days. I don't think he'll

make the show, but I think he'll let me

stay with it. "Keep up the school work."

Thanks.

PITTS

Beautiful baby.

MEEKS

Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I

come.

CAMERON

Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so

cute.

CAMERON

Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix

this.

TODD

Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss

Neil's entrance.

PITTS

He said something about getting red

before we left.

CAMERON

Getting red? What does that mean?

PITTS

I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

CAMERON

So, Charlie, what's this "getting red"

bit?

TODD

W-What is that?

CHARLIE

It's an Indian warrior symbol for

virility. Makes me feel potent, like it

can drive girls crazy.

TODD

Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are

waiting.

KNOX

Chris.

KNOX

What are you doing here?

KEATING (O.S.)

Gentlemen, let's go.

KNOX

Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up.

CHARLIE

Yeah, come on, guys.

KNOX

Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they

catch you, we're both gonna be in big

trouble.

CHRIS

Oh, but it's fine--

CHRIS

It's fine for you to come barging into

my school and make a complete fool out

of me?

KNOX

I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.

CHRIS

Well, you did. Chet found out. And it

took everything I could do to keep him

from coming here and killing you. Knox,

you have got to stop this stuff.

KNOX

I can't, Chris. I love you.

CHRIS

Knox, you say that over and over. You

don't, you don't even know me.

KEATING

Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

KNOX

Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk.

CHRIS

Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I

could care less about you?

KNOX

Then you wouldn't be here warning me

about Chet.

CHRIS

I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the

play.

KNOX

Are you going with him?

CHRIS

(laughs)

Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?

KNOX

Then come with me.

CHRIS

Knox, you are so infuriating.

KNOX

Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance.

If you don't like me after tonight, I'll

stay away forever.

CHRIS

Uh-huh.

KNOX

I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come

with me tonight. And then, if you don't

want to see me again, I swear I'll bow

out.

CHRIS

You know what would happen if Chet found

out?

KNOX

He won't know anything. We'll sit in the

back and sneak away as soon as it's

over.

CHRIS

And I suppose you would promise that

this would be the end of it.

KNOX

Dead Poets Honor.

CHRIS

What is that?

KNOX

My word.

CHRIS

You are so infuriating.

CHARLIE

Hey, there he is! Hey, hey.

KEATING

Shh, boys.

FAIRY

Either I mistake your shape and making

quite,

Or else you are that shrewd and knavish

sprite

Call'd Robin Goodfellow:

PUCK

Thou speak'st aright;

PUCK

I am that merry wanderer of the night.

I jest to Oberon and make him smile

When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,

PUCK

Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:

And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,

In very likeness of a roasted crab,

And when she drinks, against her lips I

bob

And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.

The wisest aunt, telling the saddest

tale,

CHARLIE

(whispering)

He's good. He's really good.

PUCK

Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh

me;

Then slip I from her bum, down topples

she,

And "tailor" cries, and falls into a

cough;

And then the whole quire hold their hips

and laugh,

And waxen in their mirth and neeze and

swear

A merrier hour was never wasted there.

But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon.

FAIRY

And here my mistress. Would that he were

gone!

LYSANDER

Then by your side no bed-room me deny;

For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie

HERMIA

Lysander riddles very prettily:

Now much beshrew my manners and my

pride,

If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.

But, gentle friend, for love and

courtesy

Lie further off; in human modesty,

Such separation as may well be said

Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,

and, good night, sweet friend:

Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life

end!

LYSANDER

Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

DIRECTOR

Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on,

Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

PUCK

If we shadows have offended,

PUCK

Think but this, and all is mended,

That you have but slumber'd here

While these visions did appear.

And this weak and idle theme,

No more yielding but a dream,

Gentles, do not reprehend:

If you pardon, we will mend:

And, as I am an honest Puck,

If we have unearned luck

Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,

We will make amends ere long;

Else the Puck a liar call;

So, good night unto you all.

Give me your hands, if we be friends,

And Robin shall restore amends.

BOYS

Yawp!

KNOX

Yeah, Neil!

MR. PERRY

Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to

see him.

WOMAN

Neil, Your father. He's-

ACTOR

What did you think?

WOMAN

Really I thought you were all just

wonderful!

MR. PERRY

Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

CHARLIE

Neil, Neil, you were great.

NEIL

I can't, guys.

TODD

Neil! Neil!

KEATING

Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a

performance You left even me speechless.

You have to stay with-

MR. PERRY

Get in the car. Keating, you stay away

from my son.

CHARLIE

Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on.

KEATING

Don't make it any worse than it is.

CHARLIE

Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?

CHARLIE

Knox.

MR. PERRY

We're trying very hard to understand why

it is that you insist on defying us.

Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let

you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm

withdrawing you from Welton and

enrolling you in Braden Military School.

You're going to Harvard and you're gonna

be a doctor.

NEIL

But that's ten more years. Father,

that's a lifetime!

MR. PERRY

Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You

make it sound like a prison term. You

don't understand, Neil. You have

opportunities that I never even dreamt

of and I am not going to let you waste

them.

NEIL

I've got to tell you what I feel.

MRS. PERRY

We've been so worried about--

MR. PERRY

What? What? Tell me what you feel. What

is it?

MR. PERRY

Is it more of this, this acting

business? Because you can forget that.

What?

NEIL

Nothing.

MR. PERRY

Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

NEIL

I was good. I was really good.

MRS. PERRY

Go on, get some sleep.

MR. PERRY

It's all right. It's going to be all

right.

MR. PERRY

What was that?

MRS. PERRY

What?

MR. PERRY

That sound.

MRS. PERRY

What sound? Tom?

MRS. PERRY

What is it? What's wrong?

MR. PERRY

Neil.

MRS. PERRY

Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

MR. PERRY

Neil?

MRS. PERRY

I'll look outside. Neil?

MR. PERRY

No!

MR. PERRY

Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!

MRS. PERRY

Oh! No!

MR. PERRY

Oh, my son!

MRS. PERRY

He's all right.

MR. PERRY

My son! My poor son!

MRS. PERRY

(crying hysterically)

He's all right! He's all right! He's all

right! He's all right! He's all right!

He's all right!

MR. PERRY

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

CHARLIE

Todd? Todd.

TODD

Oh, Charlie.

TODD

What is it?

CHARLIE

Neil's dead.

TODD

It's so beautiful.

CHARLIE

Todd. It's okay, Todd.

PITTS

Calm down.

CHARLIE

It's all right, Todd.

PITTS

Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.

CHARLIE

It's all right. It's alright.

TODD

He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.

MEEKS

You can't explain it, Todd.

TODD

It was his father!

CHARLIE

No!

TODD

He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-

He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his

father did it.

CHARLIE

Todd.

TODD

His father killed him. He made him do it.

MEEKS

You can't explain it, Todd.

MEEKS

Todd!

CHARLIE

Leave him be.

BOYS

(singing)

All my life

Thy light shall surely follow me

And in God's house forevermore

My dwelling place shall be

Amen.

MR. NOLAN

The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He

was a fine student. One of Welton's

best. And he will be missed. We've

contacted each of your parents to

explain the situation. Naturally,

they're all quite concerned. At the

request of Neil's family, I intend to

conduct a thorough inquiry into this

matter. Your complete cooperation is

expected.

CHARLIE

You told him about this meeting?

PITTS

Twice.

CHARLIE

That's it, guys. We're all fried.

PITTS

How do you mean?

CHARLIE

Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office

right now, finking.

PITTS

About what?

CHARLIE

The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The

board of directors, the trustees and Mr.

Nolan. Do you think for one moment

they're gonna let this thing just blow

over? Schools go down because of things

like this. They need a scapegoat.

CAMERON

What's going on, guys?

CHARLIE

You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

CAMERON

Finked? I didn't know what the hell

you're talking about.

CHARLIE

You told Nolan everything about the club

is what I'm talking about.

CAMERON

Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,

there's something called an honor code

at this school, all right? If a teacher

asks you a question, you tell the truth

or you're expelled.

CHARLIE

You little-

MEEKS

Charlie!

CHARLIE

He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,

so he rattled to save himself.

KNOX

Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and

you're out.

CHARLIE

I'm out anyway!

KNOX

You don't know that, not yet.

CAMERON

He's right there, Charlie. And if you

guys are smart, you will do exactly what

I did and cooperate. They're not after

us. We're the victims. Us and Neil.

CHARLIE

What's that mean? Who are they after?

CAMERON

Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The

"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys

didn't really think he could avoid

responsibility, did you?

CHARLIE

Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is

that what they're saying?

CAMERON

Well, who else do you think, dumb ass?

The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr.

Keating put us up to all this crap,

didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating,

Neil would be cozied up in his room

right now, studying his chemistry and

dreaming of being called doctor.

TODD

That is not true, Cameron. You know

that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil

loved acting.

CAMERON

Believe what you want, but I say let

Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

CAMERON

You just signed your expulsion papers,

Nuwanda.

CAMERON

And if the rest of you are smart, you'll

do exactly what I did. They know

everything anyway. You can't save

Keating, but you can save yourselves.

HAGER

Knox Overstreet.

TODD

Meeks?

MEEKS

Go away. I have to study.

TODD

What happened to Nuwanda?

MEEKS

Expelled.

TODD

What'd you tell 'em?

MEEKS

Nothing they didn't already know.

HAGER (O.S.)

Todd Anderson.

MR. ANDERSON

Hello, son.

MRS. ANDERSON

Hello, darling.

TODD

Mom.

MR. NOLAN

Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

MR. NOLAN

Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well

put together what's happened here. You

do admit to being a part of this Dead

Poets Society?

MR. ANDERSON

Answer him, Todd.

TODD

Yes, sir.

MR. NOLAN

I have here a detailed description of

what occurred at your meetings. It

describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating,

encouraged you boys to organize this

club and to use it as a source of

inspiration for reckless and self-

indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr.

Keating, both in and out of the

classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to

follow his obsession with acting when he

knew all along it was against the

explicit order of Neil's parents. It was

Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his

position as teacher that led directly to

Neil Perry's death.

MR. NOLAN

Read that document carefully, Todd. Very

carefully.

MR. NOLAN

If you've nothing to add or amend, sign

it.

TODD

What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?

MR. ANDERSON

I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

McALLISTER

Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is

stone. The entire building is

aedificium.

MR. NOLAN

Sit.

MR. NOLAN

I'll be teaching this class through

exams. We'll find a permanent English

teacher during the break. Who will tell

me where you are in the Pritchard

textbook?

MR. NOLAN

Mr. Anderson?

TODD

Uh, in the, in the Pr-

MR. NOLAN

I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.

TODD

In the, in the, in the Pritchard?

MR. NOLAN

Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.

CAMERON

We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered

the Romantics and some of the chapters

on Post Civil War literature.

MR. NOLAN

What about the Realists?

CAMERON

I believe we skipped most of that, sir.

MR. NOLAN

All right, then, we'll start over. What

is poetry?

MR. NOLAN

Come.

KEATING

Excuse me. I came for my personals.

Should I come back after class?

MR. NOLAN

Get them now, Mr. Keating.

MR. NOLAN

Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the

introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud

the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on

"Understanding Poetry."

CAMERON

That page has been ripped out, sir.

MR. NOLAN

Well, borrow somebody else's book.

CAMERON

They're all ripped out, sir.

MR. NOLAN

What do you mean, they're all ripped

out?

CAMERON

Sir, we, uh-

MR. NOLAN

Never mind.

MR. NOLAN

Read!

CAMERON

"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans

Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand

poetry, we must first be fluent with its

meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then

ask two questions: 1) How artfully has

the objective of the poem been rendered

and 2)..."

CAMERON

"... How important is that objective?

Question 1 rates the poem's perfection;

question 2 rates its importance. And

once these questions have been answered,

determining the poem's greatness becomes

a relatively simple matter. If the

poem's score for perfection is plotted

on the horizontal of a graph--"

TODD

Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign

it.

MR. NOLAN

Quiet, Mr. Anderson.

TODD

You gotta believe me. It's true.

KEATING

I do believe you, Todd.

MR. NOLAN

Leave, Mr. Keating.

TODD

But it wasn't his fault!

MR. NOLAN

Sit down, Mr. Anderson!

MR. NOLAN

One more outburst from you or anyone

else, and you're out of this school!

Leave, Mr. Keating.

MR. NOLAN

I said leave, Mr. Keating.

TODD
