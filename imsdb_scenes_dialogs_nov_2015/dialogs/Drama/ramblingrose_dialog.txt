DAVE WILKIE

(not on track)

Buddd-dee! My God, if it ain't

Buddy! Well, if this ain't the

darnest thing!

WILLCOX HILLYER

(not on track)

Excuse me... your voice is familiar

and I'm sure I know you from

somewhere...

DAVE WILKIE

(not on track, with

delighted injury)

Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know

me!

WILLCOX HILLYER

(not on track)

Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

DAVE WILKIE

(not on track)

It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,

don't you remember me?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(not on track)

Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how

are you?

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVE WILKIE

Well, I am in the construction

business, Buddy, and without

braggin' I have done real good at

it.

(with a meaningful

bitterness)

There are those who wouldn't have

expected that out of me.

(pauses as if waiting for

a reaction, but Hillyer

is very silent)

Right now I'm buildin' a giant

motel unit near Alexandria, outside

Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm

on the construction side.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(making polite talk)

Well, that's interesting, Dave. I

always liked Washington, it's a

pretty town.

DAVE WILKIE

Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York.

But the niggers have took it over,

just like every other city we got,

only worse.

DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)

But I have done real good in the

construction field. What I don't

know about buildin' ain't worth

knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight

thousand smackeroos last year,

how's that for an old country boy?

DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)

Ha ha, course you make a lot more.

(points at the galleys)

What's that you got there, Buddy?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(reluctantly)

Galley proof.

DAVE WILKIE

Galley what?

WILLCOX HILLYER

Page proof of a book I'm working

on.

DAVE WILKIE

How about that. Well, you always

were a screwball.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(lifts an eyebrow in mild

irony)

Oh, yeah?

DAVE WILKIE

(unfazed)

I don't mean that the way it

sounds.

(stares at galleys as if

rattlesnake)

Imagine it, a book. And I used to

know you personal way back when.

(pauses, then earnestly)

Tell me something, Buddy, how do

you dream up all that stuff?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(absolutely straight)

Well, actually, we have a little

black boy named Her---t who lives

in the garage. He does it for me.

DAVE WILKIE

(for a moment half

believes it, then a slow,

stupid grin)

Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,

always jokin' around. Almost as

much of a joker as your Daddy.

(drains his drink,

grimaces; a heavy

drinker, Dave)

I saw your Daddy a coupla years

ago, I was up in Glenville lookin'

at a motel site. I guess that's

where you're headed, huh, to see

him?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(stares out of plane

window)

That's right, Dave, I'm headed for

Glenville on a whisperin' jet.

DAVE WILKIE

(suddenly calls out)

Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us

another drink!

(to Hillyer, sullenly)

Dumb little bitch, supposed to give

us two in the first place.

DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)

This friggin' airline's out of its

mind.

(a martyr)

The sons of bitches tried to put me

in tourist.

(portentuously

philosophical)

But our whole civilization is

screwed up, Buddy. The heebies and

the coconuts have took it over and

ruined it.

DAVE WILKIE

Took your time gettin' here.

WILLCOX HILLYER

She has other things to do, Dave.

DAVE WILKIE

Supposed to get two drinks in the

first place. This friggin' airline

can't do nothin' right.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(obviously getting him off

subject)

Tell me about that job in

Alexandria, Dave, the big motel

you're building.

DAVE WILKIE

(with pedantic exactitude,

the man is a complete

pain in the ass)

Near Alexandria. It isn't in

Alexandria, it is outside it.

WILLCOX HILLYER

I see. Outside it.

DAVE WILKIE

That's correct -- outside it, not

in it. As for the job, well, the

Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of

grief and we use a pile of niggers

to haul and tote and they ain't

worth a sorry-ass damn.

(takes big swallow of

drink)

But I can build anything, Buddy.

Give me the plans and I can build a

goddamn staircase to the moon. It's

a fact, I can build anything...

(pauses, then bitterly)

... but she never believed that.

Oh, hell, no, she never believed in

me.

WILLCOX HILLYER

Um-m, well...

DAVE WILKIE

(broodingly)

Doubted my ability all along, the

little bitch. I never remarried,

Buddy, you know that, don't you?

WILLCOX HILLYER

Well, no, I didn't actually.

DAVE WILKIE

She's te reason -- cured me of

women once and for all. Oh, I got

rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste

no time kickin' that bitch out.

Hell, she was screwin' everybody in

Savannah. I caught her in a motel

with this long tall son of a bitch

and boy did I beat the everlastin'

piss out of him!

DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)

She didn't marry him, though, later

she married another guy and went to

Winston-Salem. It didn't last

That girl couldn't have no lastin'

marriage, she left him and married

another dumb sucker and went out

west. Little bitch left him, too,

and you know what she's married to

right now?

(puts a big finger on

Hillyer's chest)

A kike. That's right, some kind of

kike horse doctor named Schapiro

out in Seattle, who's got the nerve

to have the same first name I got.

Wouldn't you know it, Rose would

wind up married to a goddamn kike?

She was always out of her friggin'

head and I'll tell you why.

(his eyes narrow and again

he puts a finger on

Hillyer's chest)

Buddy, she was sick in her mind and

between her legs, too. She was

a nymphomaniac.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(he has had enough; with a

pale trembling anger and

in even tone)

Dave, you are as full of shit as a

Christmas turkey and you know it.

Now if you want to start a fight on

this plane and get yourself in

jail, go right ahead. But I am

telling you, you are full of shit

right up to your eyeballs.

DAVE WILKIE

(with surprising mildness;

a little smile almost as

if he is pleased)

I don't want to start no fight with

you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full

of shit?

WILLCOX HILLYER

Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor

and Rose has been a good wife to

him for a long time. To call her a

nymphomaniac is the most stupid

thing I ever heard in my life.

DAVE WILKIE

(again surprisingly mild)

You loved her, didn't you. Well, so

did I.

(a little shrug)

You'll have to admit she had four

husbands.

WILLCOX HILLYER

Yeah, it took her a while to grow

up and find Mr. Right, but she did

it. She found him.

DAVE WILKIE

(another little smile)

She used to call me Mr. Right.

Remember that, Buddy?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(he is pale with anger)

Yeah, I remember it.

DAVE WILKIE

Well, I tell you, I don't know what

the world's come to these days.

Things used to be better. We didn't

have any money, but things were

better.

(grimaces in anger)

Goddamn niggers and kikes burning

the flag, rioting, raising hell --

they ought to shoot their asses

off. I tell you, Buddy, where this

country made its mistake was

allowing people without property to

vote.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVE WILKIE

(holds out hand)

Well, got to get a plane to

Savannah. Great running into you,

Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

WILLCOX HILLYER

Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.

DAVE WILKIE

(sweating, tense, under

some kind of awful

emotional strain)

Ah-h, if you happen to run into

Rose sometime... do me a favor,

give her a message for me, will

you?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(a trifle wearily)

Dave, I haven't seen Rose for

years.

DAVE WILKIE

Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a

heart attack last year, I wasn't

expected to live.

DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)

You might see her. She writes your

Daddy, and she and that doctor came

to see him, didn't they? I wish

you'd tell her something... I never

could write letters.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(in a different tone,

interested, curious)

What do you want me to tell her,

Dave?

DAVE WILKIE

(a painful inward

struggle; the man is

tormented, miserable)

Oh, to hell with it, never mind.

Don't tell her anything. Don't even

tell her you saw me.

(half turns his back, his

face twisted with strong

emotion)

Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my

plane.

WILLCOX HILLYER

He still loves her. The poor damn

fool still loves her.

HERTZ GIRL

Who was she?

WILLCOX HILLYER

A girl named Rose.

(pulls himself back into

the world of reality)

Still take R75 to Glenville?

HERTZ GIRL

Yes, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to

live with you and your family.

ROSE (CONT'D)

What's your name? What do they call

you?

BUDDY

Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.

ROSE

(greatly reassured, a real

smile now)

Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice

name, I like it. I am real pleased

to meet you.

(solemnly holds out her

hand, they shake)

Hey, look, do you think you got a

cold drink of ice water somewhere?

BUDDY

Sure. Let me take your suitcase.

ROSE

You're sweet.

BUDDY

The new girl is here.

MOTHER

Wonderful. What's she like,

Brother? What is your impression of

her?

BUDDY

She talks a great deal and smiles a

lot. She's very pretty, she has a

real good figure. She's very

girlish or womanish, if you know

what I mean. She wouldn't hurt

anybody, this girl. She couldn't.

MOTHER

Your impression is very reassuring,

Brother. Of course she's had

troubles, poor thing, but I sensed

that was that the girl was like and

I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

BUDDY

You mean confirmed, Mother. I

didn't confirm it before. I would

have had to confirm it previously,

in order for it to be reconfirmed.

MOTHER

All right, all right. Doll and

Waski are upstairs taking their

nap, you go get them and bring them

down to the living room. Where is

the girl?

BUDDY

In the kitchen drinking all the ice

water in Glenville. She walked out

here, she didn't go by the hotel.

MOTHER

Walked, in all that heat? It's a

wonder she hasn't got sunstroke.

I'll phone Daddy and you go get

Doll Baby and Waski.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

Rose, this is Waski. His real name

is Warren but we call him Waski. He

doesn't like it much and I suppose

someday we'll have to stop calling

him that.

WASKI

You can stop it right now.

MOTHER

When he was baby we called him "Wa

Wa," a baby name, you know. You

will find him a very good boy. His

brother can be bad and so can his

sister, but Waski is a very good

boy. And as you can see he's

beautiful.

WASKI

Oh, Mother, cut it out.

MOTHER

(serenely)

There are plenty of girls who would

give thousands of dollars to have

your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty

and that's all there is to it.

Beauty is there and we have to

recognize it. Now Rose, the little

girl sitting across from you with

the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She

looks like an angel and she is an

angel, but she can be a naughty

angel sometimes, although her

father won't believe it. Her real

name is Frances, but we call her

Dolly or Doll.

DOLL

I don't like that, either, it's

worse than Waski. I want to be

called Fran.

MOTHER

Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the

redhaired boy you see sitting

there, of course you have met him,

he is my oldest son and my most

brilliant child. All children have

great creative powers, but I don't

want to rattle on about my

children, they say I brag too much

about them, especially about

Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?

ROSE

(feebly)

Oh, no, ma'am.

MOTHER

Well, it's rather interesting about

Brother, actually. I realized the

remarkable thing he had when he was

six weeks old. He looked at me and

understood me, he knew exactly who

I was. I know it sounds crazy but

it's true. He's very remarkable, he

was born for the ministry and could

move millions, but he doesn't know

that yet. I have to warn you about

him, he can be very dangerous,

there is an evil streak in him, a

streak of pure sheer meanness. But

at heart Brother is saintly and

that is why he was born for the

ministry even if he doesn't know

it.

DADDY'S VOICE

Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out

of the girl going into the fourth

dimension like that.

MOTHER

It isn't the fourth dimension. To

you it's the fourth dimension,

maybe, to me it's simply the truth.

DADDY

(staring fiercely at Rose)

Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud

has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all

assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un

hmmm.

DADDY (CONT'D)

Well, Rosebud, now you are here,

darling, and I swear to God

graceful as the capital letter S.

You will adorn our house, Rosebud,

you will give a glow and a shine to

these old walls. If there's one

thing I like to have around, it's a

frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume

Mrs. Hillyer and the children have

introduced themselves and made your

acquaintance, and so forth and so

on?

ROSE

Yes, sir.

DADDY

All right. Now as head of this

household I have a couple of

remarks to make. It is my dear

wife's belief, which I accept

although I do not totally grasp it,

that to hire a person to do

household work is a criminal

practice. Therefore, you are here

not as a servant, you are here as a

friend, as a guest and hopefully as

a member of this family. You will

eat your meals with us, you will

share life itself with us -- in

love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in

love and harmony. Do you understand

me?

ROSE

(a half whisper)

Yes, sir.

DADDY

Now, I know you've had some

troubles in your life, those...

scoundrels in Birmingham and so

forth trying to... lead you astray.

I hope you find a safe haven here,

honey, I know you've had a hard

time. Life can be cruel to a young

girl all alone. We welcome you to

our home, Rosebud, we all welcome

you from the heart and hope you are

happy here.

ROSE

Yes, sir.

BUDDY

Rose, who were those scoundrels in

Birmingham?

ROSE

Nobody.

BUDDY

But who were they?

ROSE

They were just bad men, that's all.

BUDDY

In what sense were they bad?

ROSE

Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no

sense to it.

BUDDY

Did they try to induce you to

become a prostitute?

ROSE

I don't answer talk like that,

Buddy. I just don't hear it, I turn

my back and look away.

BUDDY

Was that what they tried to do? Was

that why Daddy gave you the job, to

save you from those scoundrels?

ROSE

Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll

say that. He's the best and most

kind-hearted man in the world.

BUDDY

Hey, Rose, did you hear about that

terrible thing down in Cave

Springs?

ROSE

What terrible thing in Cave

Springs?

BUDDY

There was this old man that ate his

niece.

ROSE

I didn't hear you. I didn't hear

that.

BUDDY

He really did, he ate his little

niece. He made pork chops out of

her.

ROSE

I don't hear you. I just turn my

back on that kind of talk and look

away.

BUDDY

Well, it's only the truth. There

are horrible things in the world,

Rose.

ROSE

Buddy, you are in one of your evil

moods, I don't want to talk to you.

I'm going out and sweep the patio.

BUDDY

Rose is almost as sentimental as

Mother. If there's one thing I

can't stand it's sentimentality. In

Chattanooga this man committed an

almost perfect murder. He killed

his wife with a black widow spider.

DOLL

Oh, shut up, Buddy.

WASKI

Yeah, shut up.

ROSE

What are you studying now, Mrs.

Hillyer?

MOTHER

More history, Rose.

ROSE

Are you going to get your degree

soon?

MOTHER

Well, I am working on my thesis.

ROSE

(as she busily sweeps)

It must be wonderful to be so

smart. I don't see how you do it,

reading all those books, learning

all that stuff.

MOTHER

(looks up, and gently)

Rose, you work too hard. Why don't

you go sit down somewhere and drink

a Co-Cola?

ROSE

(smiles, trusts and knows

Mother now, not at all

afraid of her)

You're so sweet.

MOTHER

Really, why don't you go sit down

somewhere?

ROSE

I like to work. I don't mind work.

It's the least I can do after all

you and Mr. Hillyer have done for

me.

(stares worshipfully at

Mother)

You're so sweet. There never was

nobody like you.

MOTHER

(gently)

Well, you run on now.

ROSE

Yes, Ma'am.

DADDY

Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful

day.

MOTHER

Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd

work outside.

DADDY

How goes it, darlin'?

MOTHER

Slow, hon. But at least I can

concentrate now that Rose is here.

DADDY

What do you think of her, honey?

DADDY (CONT'D)

Turn up your hearing aid.

MOTHER

What?

DADDY

Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at

me like a snake.

MOTHER

(adjusts hearing aid)

Oh. Did you say something?

DADDY

I asked you what you think of

Rosebud, now that she's been here a

while.

MOTHER

Honey, she's perfect. She works all

the time and she's wonderful with

the children. And they love her,

even Brother likes her though he

won't admit it. I think she's just

perfect.

DADDY

Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

MOTHER

And she's such a good-hearted

thing, there isn't an ounce of harm

or malice in her.

DADDY

Well, I'll admit I don't see any

flies on her yet.

MOTHER

There are no flies on Rose, I don't

know what you're talking about.

DADDY

Well, she must have done something

to encourage those scoundrels in

Birmingham, even if she did run

away from them.

MOTHER'S VOICE

If you mean... boys and men, I

don't think so. Rose seems very

calm about all of that.

DADDY'S VOICE

Well, so far I have to agree. She

seems calm as lettuce.

BUDDY

Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce.

Do you believe that, Doll?

DOLL

No.

WASKI

Neither do I.

BUDDY

Oh, Waski, you don't even know what

we're talking about.

WASKI

I do, too.

DADDY

Well, let's hope for the best,

darlin'.

MOTHER

Hope for the best? I don't

understand all this skepticism. I

thought you liked Rose.

DADDY

I love Rosebud, I am wild about

Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't

turn out to be a hidden hotcha

character, that's all. We have

growing children in the house.

MOTHER

Hotcha character. If I had to live

with your cynicism, I wouldn't want

to live at all. What you can't

understand is that the creative

forces of the universe are

positive, not negative.

DADDY

(gently, his irony is

mild)

All right, darlin', don't go off

into the fourth dimension.

MOTHER

I'm not in the fourth dimension --

(points a finger at him)

-- you are in the fourth dimension,

when you allow skepticism and doubt

to take control. As Blake said, if

God had doubt the sun would go out.

DADDY

(again gentle irony,

always courtly toward

her)

Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I

don't understand these deeper

things the way you do.

MOTHER

(reaches up, takes his

hand)

Be nice to Rose. She's never had a

real home.

DADDY

You're a wonderful woman, darlin'.

As long as you're around, I'm sure

the sun wouldn't dare go out.

BUDDY

It's pitiful. Neither one of them

know.

DOLL

(as she shakes dice)

I think Daddy suspects.

BUDDY

No, he doesn't. Not really.

BUDDY

It's really pitiful. She's in bad

shape.

DOLL

She's watching the car again?

BUDDY

Yeah.

DOLL

I get so irritated with Daddy. He's

so dumb sometimes.

WASKI

Yeah, I know.

BUDDY

Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.

WASKI

I do, too!

BUDDY

All right, what do you know?

WASKI

Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

DOLL

(pauses, then solemnly)

Well, don't tell Mother.

WASKI

Do you think I'm crazy?

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

(in a good humor)

Rosebaby Blossom, these are the

most delicious candied yams I ever

ate! Why, they just melt in my

mouth. And this fried chicken is

fit for a king. How do you do it,

Peachbird? What is the secret of

your art, Plum Blossom, huh?

ROSE

(blushing, smiling)

Oh, I don't know, I... I...

DADDY

Rosebird Baby, you are the light of

my life, darlin'. How did we ever

get by without you?

ROSE

(stares at him, stricken)

I... I'll get the grits.

MOTHER

Rose does have a gift for cooking.

She learns so fast, but mainly I

think it's that she tries so hard.

MOTHER

(gently, suspects

absolutely nothing)

Rose, you're in an awful dither

tonight. What's the matter with

you, honey, are you sick or

something?

ROSE

(in a feeble voice)

No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

MOTHER

You look sick if you ask me. I hate

to leave you with the dishes and

all, but I'm supposed to go to a

meeting of the Garden Club this

evening.

(to Daddy)

I'll need the car keys.

DADDY

I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got

no business behind the wheel of an

automobile. You don't think about

what you're doing and you'll run

into a telephone pole.

MOTHER

I think about what I'm doing all

the time, and I've got as much

business behind the wheel of an

automobile as anybody. Besides, I

want you to stay and help Rose with

the dishes, the poor girl isn't

feeling well.

DADDY

All right, darlin'.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

(to himself, mostly)

Hmmp. Did you realize there are a

thousand Coca-Cola millionaires in

Atlanta?

BUDDY

There goes Mother.

DOLL

Yeah.

BUDDY

Let's go peep from the living room.

DOLL

Okay.

DOLL

I think she's gonna kiss him.

BUDDY

At least.

DADDY

(half to himself)

Ehh, Lord, should have bought that

stock when we had some money. A

thousand millionaires.

ROSE

Oh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love

you, I love you so much! I've

tried, but I can't help it! Please

kiss me -- will you kiss me?

DADDY

(finally clears his

throat)

Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap.

What are you doing, girl? Are you

crazy?

ROSE

Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr.

Hillyer!

DADDY

Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you

crazy girl. Now I'm telling you

again, get off my lap. Come on,

Rose, get up. Now you get up, I

say, and stop this!

ROSE

No, no! You don't understand, I

love you! It's real love and I

can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr.

Hillyer, I love you, I love you so

much...

DADDY

(in a shaken voice)

All right, all right. Now calm

down, Rose, the children will hear

you. Calm down, let's talk... about

this thing, let's discuss it.

ROSE

(sobbing)

Don't make me... me... me... get

up!

DADDY

Calm down, Rose, let's calm down

and discuss it ...

DOLL

I can't see. What are they doing,

what's happening?

BUDDY

They're discussing it.

DOLL

I can't see, let me see...

BUDDY

This is my place and you can't have

it.

DOLL

(a whispered moan of

frustration)

Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?

BUDDY

(his eyes open wide)

He's trying to get up -- good God,

one of her titties is out!

DOLL

Let me see!

BUDDY

Now I can't see. What are they

doing?

DOLL

(happy, peeping through

crack)

Boy! Wow!

DOLL

Wow! Brrrother!

BUDDY

What are they doing?

DOLL

Buddy, this is amazing, you

wouldn't believe it.

BUDDY

What are they doing, Doll?

DOLL

(staring, enthralled)

He kissed her.

BUDDY

Is that all?

DOLL

(happily, enjoying it)

He had his hand on her titty.

BUDDY

Let me look.

(can't stand it, grabs her

around waist and pulls

her away; eagerly looks,

sags)

Aww-rr...

DADDY

All right, that is enough of this

nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up

off this floor, Rose, and put your

damned tit back in your dress! Do

you hear me, girl, get up off of

that floor!

ROSE

Ohh-hhh... ohh...

BUDDY

(disappointed)

She's putting the titty back.

DOLL

(a furious whisper)

Buddy, that was my place.

DADDY

Goddamn you, girl! You've made me

make a fool out of myself, damn

your hide, but let me tell you I am

standing at the pass of Thermopylae

and I won't budge! The very idea,

my own home with children in the

house, to say nothing of my wife --

oh-h, you had better believe I am

standing at Thermopylae, you little

nut, you had better believe it!

What are you, crazy? A man is

supposed to be a fool like this,

but a woman is supposed to have

some control and sense! Are you a

nitwit? What's the matter with you?

ROSE

(weeping)

Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr.

Hillyer... I just... couldn't help

myself. I'm sorry...

DOLL

Buddy, that was pretty snotty of

you, pushing me away like that just

when it was interesting.

BUDDY

You shouldn't watch such things,

Doll.

DADDY

Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor

miserable little child, don't you

know I love you? Do I have to put

my hand on your body or kiss your

pretty lips to prove it? You are

beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved

you since you first came here,

darlin'. And don't you know Mrs.

Hillyer loves you, too, that she's

already taken you into her heart,

and that that woman's heart is as

wide as the blue sky itself and as

deep as the stars?

ROSE

(weeping in handkerchief)

Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's

been so good to me...

DADDY

Do you know what a friend you have

got there? Do you know she would

fight for you like a tiger, that

she would fly to your defense in an

instant with all the courage in her

soul if anyone tried to hurt you?

Is this any way to repay her trust

and love? Are you ashamed as I am

ashamed?

(pauses as Rose sobs in

handkerchief)

Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But

let me warn you, damn your hide,

this is Thermopylae and I am

standing here. Do you hear me, damn

you. I am standing at Thermopylae

and the Persians shall not pass!

Now get your tail out of here and

go wash those dishes, and stop

crying!

DOLL

Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted

to kiss her some more and play with

her, but he didn't, because he

loves Mother and all of us, and he

loves Rose, too. Isn't he

wonderful, isn't he great?

BUDDY

(dryly, aloof; he doesn't

mean this really)

Wonderful? He kissed her and played

with her titty, and I don't see

anything so great about that. He

was probably afraid Mother would

come back early and catch him.

DOLL

You know, Buddy, sometimes you make

me sick.

BUDDY

(quietly, to himself)

Thermopylae. The Persians shall not

pass.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

Buddy... are you asleep?

BUDDY

No, I'm awake. What's the matter?

ROSE

Buddy, I am wandering in a

wilderness, lost.

(sits glumly on edge of

bed)

I just feel awful. Do you mind if I

get in bed with you for a little

while?

BUDDY

Well, all right.

ROSE

I thought I'd go crazy back there

in that room all by myself with

nobody to talk to. As a child, I

never had no room all to myself, we

were awful poor. Buddy... I have

got a confession to make.

BUDDY

What is it, Rose?

ROSE

It's so terrible I can't tell you.

Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it

hurts to have a broken heart, what

a terrible feeling it is, and I've

had a broken heart so many times.

Men, I don't understand them, I

can't figure them out and they

break my heart, that's all. I can't

find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find

him no matter how hard I look, all

I find is a whole pile of Mr.

Wrongs. But this is the worst ever

because it wasn't his fault. It was

my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was

bad -- oh God, I was bad, you

wouldn't believe how bad I was.

BUDDY

(a little smile)

What'd you do, Rose?

ROSE

Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell

you who it was, but do you know

what I did? I sat on his lap and

got ahold of him and wiggled and

wiggled my ass on him and was

worse'n you could know, a child

like you. Why, I let one of my tits

fall out deliberate on purpose and

practically smack him in the face

with it and I let my dern skirt

come up so he could see my

drawers...

(pauses, realizes this

isn't too dignified)

But to get back serious to what I

was sayin', it is not only, Buddy,

the loss of him but my own bad

behavior what bothers me so...

BUDDY

You were pretty bad, huh?

ROSE

Why, it has just made me ill,

Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to

eat nothin', I don't, and me I got

a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral

for me. I'm ill.

BUDDY

(slyly, pretends he

doesn't know)

But, Rose, what is the cause of it

all?

ROSE

Promise not to tell Doll? -- or

nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm

so much in love with him I am out

of my mind!

BUDDY

But, Rose, how could such a thing

as that happen?

ROSE

I fell madly in love with him when

he called me Rosebud. You know that

first day when I come and he said I

looked graceful like a capital

letter S and called me Rosebud? I

fell madly in love with that man

right then.

(sighs tragically)

But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a

good man and won't have nothin' to

do with me.

BUDDY

(casually)

Can I touch you here?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

ROSE

(casually, doesn't object)

What did you expect?

BUDDY

Well, I thought they were more like

a cantaloupe.

ROSE

Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a

cantaloupe.

BUDDY

(touches her breast more

boldly, his hand outside

the nightgown)

There's some kind of gristle in it,

though.

ROSE

Buddy, quit that, you're just a

child, you're not supposed to be

interested in such things.

BUDDY

Actually, I am, though.

ROSE

(dreamily, thinking of

Daddy as she smokes

cigarette and stares up

at the ceiling)

You know, that Daddy of yours is

the funniest man, the things he

says, you never know what's going

to come out of his mouth next.

BUDDY

Can I put my hand inside your

nightgown, Rose?

ROSE

No, you can't. And I'll tell you

this -- he scares me. As kind as he

is, he scares me. You can't fool

around with him, not with that man.

And, boy, I sure better not try

nothin' like that with him again,

he'll fire me.

BUDDY

Rose, can't I see what the nipple

on it is like?

ROSE

(frowns)

Buddy, what's come over you? A

child like you, askin' such things.

BUDDY

But I'm curious, Rose.

ROSE

Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit

it, get you hand away...

BUDDY

Just for a second. Please, Rose,

what's the harm?

ROSE

(gently)

Buddy, you don't realize it but

what you're doing isn't nice.

BUDDY

Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see

what the nipple on it is like.

ROSE

You don' t need to know that. It's

none of your business.

BUDDY

Aw, be a good sport, Rose.

(sweetly, almost sugarily)

You like me, don't you? I like you

a lot.

ROSE

Well, are you satisfied now? Can we

just lie and talk, huh?

BUDDY

Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

ROSE

'Course it does.

BUDDY

First I couldn't feel it, but now I

feel it easily, it's like a little

acorn.

ROSE

(moistens her lips,

swallows; it is affecting

her; she frowns)

All right, that's enough.

(firmly pushes his hand

away)

You're just a child and wouldn't

understand it, but that type of

thing can stir a girl up. Now lie

back and we'll talk.

BUDDY

That was very interesting. Thank

you, Rose.

ROSE

(lighting cigarette)

Don't mention it.

BUDDY

(pensively, with the

solemn pedanticness of a

precocious child)

It was softer'n I thought, that was

my main impression. You know, if

you hit a girl there it would hurt

her a lot.

ROSE

Who would want to do such a thing

as that?

BUDDY

Well, some fiend might.

ROSE

(stares wonderingly at

him)

You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't

figure you out at all. You can be

very nice, but like your mother

said there's an evil streak in you.

BUDDY

There's an evil streak in

everybody, Rose.

ROSE

There ain't none in your Daddy. You

know, what happened has just made

me love him all the more. I not

only love him, I respect him, I

admire him.

BUDDY

Rose, I have a serious favor to ask

you.

ROSE

Most men wouldn't do what he done.

If they can get a girl they go

right ahead and get her -- I guess

to hell they do, just like a dern

rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell

her she's no good when they done

the same thing their selves.

They're a bunch of monkeys. I like

'em, but they're a bunch of

monkeys.

BUDDY

(trying to be casual)

Rose, since you're here in bed with

me and everything and I've already

touched your titty...

ROSE

(her eyes open wide as he

whispers)

Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What

an awful thing to say, and where

did you get any such idea as that,

anyhow?

BUDDY

I'm curious to see what it's like.

I'm very curious, Rose.

ROSE

Well, now that is just too bad!

Curiosity killed the cat.

BUDDY

Yeah, but satisfaction brought him

back. Can I?

ROSE

No! You ought to be ashamed of

yourself astin' such a nasty things

a child your age!

BUDDY

Can't I touch it a little, Rose --

not a lot, just a little?

ROSE

Of course you can't! I'm... I'm

shocked at you, Buddy, real

shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm

going back to my own bed!

BUDDY

Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's

all, I have a natural curiosity,

it's only human. You're my friend,

aren't you? Don't you like me?

(again sweetly, almost

sugarily)

I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact,

I love you.

ROSE

(softens despite herself)

Well, you're sweet, but you don't

really love me.

BUDDY

Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good

sport.

ROSE

Buddy, you're just a child.

BUDDY

I'm thirteen. And I have a natural

curiosity. It's only nature, Rose,

that's all. Now what's wrong with

nature, huh?

ROSE

Well, nothin'.

MOTHER

What's the matter, hon? Is anything

wrong?

DADDY

No, darlin'. Just that damnable

insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a

baby for an hour then I'm wide

awake. You go back to sleep.

DADDY

The Depression has got me. That

miserable hotel, no money anywhere,

strong men out of work, children

hungry. It's a great life if you

don't weaken.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

You better quit that.

BUDDY

But Rose...

ROSE

I must be outta my mind. Buddy,

quit it.

BUDDY

Am I hurting you?

ROSE

(pauses, stares off as if

listening, then in an

even feebler tone, a half

whisper)

No. No, you're not hurting me.

(moistens her lips,

swallows)

But I think you better quit it.

BUDDY

But why, if I'm not hurting you?

ROSE

You wouldn't understand.

(puts a hand on his

shoulder as if to push

him away, but can't; puts

her other hand over her

eyes)

Oh, God, I must be outta my mind.

What would your Momma think?

BUDDY

Rose, beyond a doubt this is the

most fascinating experience of my

life.

DADDY

(to himself)

Ehh-hh, Lord, man born of woman

hath few days and they are full of

trouble.

ROSE

Ohh-hh! Ohhh-hh!

(it's all over; she twists

sideways, puts both arms

around him)

Oh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love

you a lot.

BUDDY

Rose, are you all right? Are you

sick or something?

ROSE

(staring off in space,

lost in horror)

No. No, I'm all right.

(turns, stares at him,

puts a hand in woe on her

forehead)

Oh, God, what have I done? I have

robbed a cradle and fallen into

hell!

(fumbles desperately on

bed for cigarettes)

I must be crazy, a child like you.

Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,

this is terrible, I gotta get outta

here!

ROSE

Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,

would you?

BUDDY

(a trifle too piously)

Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a

soul.

ROSE

I sure hope you don't.

(still in a panic)

I gotta get outta here, good night.

BUDDY

(sweetly)

Good night, Rose.

DADDY

Rose, what are you doing up?

ROSE

Nothin', just goin' to the

bathroom.

DADDY

Is anything wrong?

ROSE

No, sir.

DADDY

Well, good night.

ROSE

Good night.

BUDDY

Wait till you hear what happened!

Now you wont believe this, Doll,

but Rose came in my room and got in

my bed last night...

BUDDY (CONT'D)

... and she sweated and snorted

like a horse and had a horrible

fit, her eyebrows were all

scrunched up and she groaned like

she was eying and foamed at the

mouth!

QUICK CUT TO:

MOTHER

Yes, dear, what is it?

DOLL

Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his

bed last night and he fiddled with

her and she snorted and had a fit --

and he says I would too if I was

grown-up. Is it true, Mother --

would I sweat and snort and froth

at the mouth and have a horrible

fit like he says?

QUICK CUT TO:

DADDY

Out! Out, you viper in the grass!

Out! Never darken our doorstep, you

immoral, terrible girl!

ROSE

Ohh-hh, ohhh-hh...

(match burns her fingers,

she shakes it out)

Ouch! Oh-hh... ohh...

ROSE (CONT'D)

He'll tell 'em for sure, he will.

Oh, Lord, what can I do?

ROSE

I hate to turn on this light, you

Daddy's awake downstairs, but I

have to take the chance.

(sits by him on bed)

Buddy, please don't tell on me.

BUDDY

(rather coolly)

I said I wouldn't.

ROSE

(her lip trembles)

Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as

I've been please have pity on me

and don't ruin me by telling them

what I did. I know it was bad, it

was bad and dumb. But mostly it was

dumb, I didn't mean you no harm,

I'd never want to hurt a hair on

your head and that's the truth. I

love you. But they'd think I did,

they'd think I was awful, they'd

despise me and hate me...

BUDDY

Well, I don't know what you're

worried about. It was my idea, I

was the one who thought of it, not

you.

ROSE

You don't understand. They'd blame

me, not you. And they'd think I was

awful, a disgustin' girl, which I

am, but Buddy, please don't tell

them. Please don't. Ill have to go

and I love it here, I love your

whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your

Mother...

(pauses, then makes her

final and ultimate plea

in a shaking voice as

tears run down)

Buddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a

bad girl but I can't help it,

please have pity on me and don't

tell! Please don't, please...

BUDDY

(very solemnly)

Rose, they could stick splinters

under my fingernails, and I will

never say a word! I will never tell

them, because... I love you!

ROSE

(sees that he means it,

smiles in relief and

throws her arms around

him)

Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew

you did, knew it all the time...

DADDY

(a half whisper to

himself)

Ehh-hh, Lord... great life if you

don't weaken.

ROSE

Well, Ill tell you this. I have

learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't

gonna run around, but when I start

botherin' your Daddy and worse

robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the

facts of life.

(pauses, then with firm

resolution)

Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get

myself up and go out.

BUDDY

(a wee mite puzzled)

You're going to get yourself up and

go out?

ROSE

Buddy, Mr. Right is out there

somewhere and I'm gonna find him!

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

Brother, when I have to wake you up

at eleven o'clock in the morning

you're either sick or you were up

very late last night.

(points a finger at him)

And you weren't reading Huckleberry

Finn. I looked and its not in your

room. Now what were you doing?

BUDDY

(sheepish)

Mother, I have to tell the truth. I

wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I

was reading one of those Little

Dirty Comic Books.

MOTHER

(sadly)

Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed

in you. You mustn't look at those

horrible things, they degrade the

human image.

BROTHER

(hangs head)

They're filthy, Mother.

MOTHER

Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the

most beautiful things in life, the

creative power of the universe is

behind it.

BROTHER

I know, Mother.

MOTHER

But we must respect that power, we

must be in awe of it.

BROTHER

I am in awe of it, Mother.

MOTHER

I don't think you are sufficiently

in awe of it. Get the castor oil.

BROTHER

(winces, as Doll and Waski

happily smile)

Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

MOTHER

This isn't punishment, I don't

believe in punishment. It's for

your health. Obviously you're sick

if you can act like that.

BUDDY

(wanly)

Mother, cant you make it calomel

instead of castor oil?

MOTHER

This is for your own good. When you

look at negative, destructive

things like those little filthy

comic books, you are sick. Here,

take this.

BUDDY

(he is resigned, there's

no way out; he makes a

face, swallows the castor

oil)

Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!

MOTHER

Stop gagging like that and putting

on a show, and swallow it.

BUDDY

Uhhh, gahdam stuff!

MOTHER

What did you say, Brother?

BUDDY

I said ahhh-dam stuff.

MOTHER

No, you didn't say that, Brother.

BUDDY

Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing

aid isn't working right. I said

ahhh-dam stuff.

DOLL

No, Mother, he's lying...

BUDDY

Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts

WASKI

(happily excited,

stammering)

He did lie, and... and... and

Mother, yesterday he stole money

out of your pocketbook!

BUDDY

Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat,

or Ill kill you!

MOTHER

Children, children! Be quiet, all

of you!

(the children at once

simmer down)

The vibrations in this house are

strange today. Where's Rose,

anyhow?

BUDDY

She's getting herself up to go out.

MOTHER

(frowns, adjusts hearing

aid)

What'd you say, Brother?

BUDDY

She's getting herself up to go out.

I think she's coming down the hall

now.

MOTHER

Oh, yes, it's Thursday.

(glances around at sound

of an opening door)

Hello, Rose, dear...

(her eyes open wide as she

stares at Rose,

disconcerted; now weakly)

... my, you're... looking pretty...

ROSE

How do you like my outfit? I made

most of it myself.

MOTHER

(smiling, slightly aghast)

Well, it's... very gay.

BUDDY

Here comes Daddy.

ROSE

(staring down admiringly

at the outfit)

I have a knack for designing

clothes. But I had to buy the shoes

and the pocketbook.

MOTHER

(makes up her mind to

defend Rose)

Well, I think it's charming, Rose.

(tactfully)

But don't you think... ah, the

skirt is a little tight?

ROSE

Oh, no, that's the style. It's

meant to be clinging.

DADDY

Ye gods and little fishes. What

have you done to yourself, Rose?

ROSE

Nothin'. I got myself up, that's

all.

DADDY

Got yourself up?

ROSE

Yeah. I'm goin' out.

DADDY

Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest

outfit I ever saw in my life. You

walk down the street like that and

they'll put you in jail, Rose.

MOTHER

Why, they won't either. She looks

pretty. And I wish you wouldn't

pick on the poor girl all the time.

Don't listen to him, Rose, you look

pretty, even beautiful.

ROSE

(smiles affectionately at

Mother)

You're so sweet.

DADDY

If you've got time before you go

"out," get me a half-a-cup of

coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a

half-a-cup.

ROSE

Why, sure, always got time to get

you a half-a-cup, and one of these

days I'm gonna get you a whole cup

and see what happens.

DADDY

(a growl, doesn't like

jokes about his foibles)

Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole

cup, my nerves can't stand the

caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful

insomnia in reverse last night. Lay

there and sweated blood for hours.

DOLL

(sweetly)

Daddy, Buddy was up late last night

reading little dirty comic books.

Mother gave him a dose of castor

oil and he cursed it, he took the

Lords name in vain, then claimed he

hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

MOTHER

You mustn't be a tattletale, dear.

You mustn't be Delilah-ish and

Jezebel-ish toward your brother,

dear.

DOLL

I'm only trying to help him,

Mother.

BUDDY

Heh, what a hypocrite.

MOTHER

(to Daddy)

I do wish you'd speak to Brother.

It's true he's been looking at

those horrible little books again.

DADDY

(stares sternly at Buddy)

Lay off of that stuff, son. It

upsets your mother.

MOTHER

(genuinely worried)

I'm serious. We forget he's just a

child. I wish you'd speak to him.

DADDY

I'll take him with me downtown.

(glances at Rose as she

comes with coffee)

And you, too, Rose, if you want a

ride.

ROSE

Sure, love one. Here's your half-a

cup of coffee.

DADDY

That's a pretty stylish skirt,

Rose. The only thing I don't

understand is how did you ever get

it on.

ROSE

(happy, pleased by his

interest)

Well, it has buttons.

DADDY

How can the buttons stand the

pressure?

ROSE

There are more on the other side.

DADDY

Turn around, darlin'.

DADDY (CONT'D)

They'll put her in jail. The damn

little fool might as well be naked.

MOTHER

(a wee mite worried)

Well, it is a little tight. But it

isn't as bad as all that. No one

will notice unless they have such

thoughts in the first place.

DADDY

Who doesn't have such thoughts?

(glances at wristwatch)

We'd better get going.

MOTHER

You're not having lunch?

DADDY

Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never

eat, darlin', you know that. Not

eating and reverse insomnia are my

curses. Let's go, Rose, you and

Brother, let's hit the road.

MOTHER

Rose, you and Brother wait in the

car. I want to speak for a moment

Lo Mr. Hillyer.

ROSE

Yes, Ma'am.

MOTHER

Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

ROSE

Did your Momma really give you

castor oil?

BUDDY

Yeah.

ROSE

(puts an arm around his

shoulders)

You're my sweetheart.

MOTHER

(earnestly)

I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose

and tease her like that. Of course

her clothes are silly, but she's

ignorant, naive, she doesn't know

any better.

DADDY

The girl worries me. If she walks

down the street like that, an army

will be following her.

MOTHER

Well, I admit that outfit isn't

very modest. But she doesn't mean

any harm, she just wants to

attract, attention.

DADDY

She will succeed.

MOTHER

I don't think you understand her.

It isn't sex she wants, it's love

she wants and this is the only way

she knows how to get it.

DADDY

(musingly)

That farmer in Gadsden was awful

eager to get rid of her, and I'm

beginning to see why.

MOTHER

He and his wife both said she had a

fine moral character and was

wonderful with children.

DADDY

Well, she loves children, all

right.

(adds dryly)

She loves everybody.

MOTHER

But that's a wonderful quality, not

a bad quality.

(takes his hand)

Have a little patience with her.

She's such a good-hearted little

thing and tries so hard.

DADDY

(stares pensively at her)

You are the one who's good-hearted.

(rises)

As for Rose, let's hope for the

best.

MOTHER

(rises, again takes his

hand)

Be kind to her. She loves you so

much.

(Daddy stiffens slightly,

and she adds)

In a perfectly proper way, of

course.

DADDY

Yes, of course.

DADDY

What have you got in your hair,

girl?

ROSE

My rose. It's kind of like a motto.

People will say, there comes Rose

with her rose.

DADDY

You were up late last night,

Brother.

BUDDY

Well, a little.

DADDY

Reading dirty comic bocks.

(glances shrewdly at him)

And you admitted it?

BUDDY

(a trifle uncomfortable)

Well, yeah.

DADDY

You were up late last night, too,

Rose.

ROSE

(meekly)

Yes, sir. I had to go to the

bathroom.

DADDY

(finally, "casually")

Sometimes I think I was born to be

a detective. I get a feeling about

things. I'm not always right, but

often I am.

DADDY

Son, was Rose in your room last

night?

BUDDY

(scared, but a good liar)

No. Why should Rose be in my room?

DADDY

I can't imagine why. It was just a

thought.

DADDY (CONT'D)

Where do you want me to let you

out, Rose?

ROSE

Oh, anywhere downtown.

DADDY

You don't know where you're going?

ROSE

Oh, I'll just mosey around here and

there.

DADDY

Is this ill right?

ROSE

It'll do just fine.

(gets out of car)

Bye-bye, see you later.

ROSE

My feet sure do hurt.

YOUNG SALESMAN

(turns to her with a slow

smile)

Oh, yeah?

DADDY

She has made contact.

DADDY

I never saw anything like it. How

did she pick him up so fast?

BUDDY

I don't know.

DADDY

The girl strikes like a cobra.

DADDY

Well, she's back.

MOTHER (O.S.)

What time is it?

DADDY

Quarter of twelve.

MOTHER (O.S.)

Is she all right?

DADDY

I don't see any bruises or broken

bones.

MOTHER

Bruises and broken bones, what kind

of thing is that to say?

MOTHER (CONT'D)

Why shouldn't she go out and have

boyfriends?

DADDY

No reason at all, darlin'.

MOTHER

Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing

and picking on her.

DADDY

Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All

I'm saying is that a girl who would

wear clothes like that is going to

get in trouble sooner or later.

MOTHER

(doubtfully)

Well, time will tell, won't it?

DADDY

Yes, darlin', time will tell.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

Rose, that scruffy-looking man is

out in the yard again.

ROSE

(her smile fades)

Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he

is, I really don't.

MOTHER

I had better call Daddy.

DADDY

Glad to have you with us, Mr.

Watson. Make yourself at home.

Shadrach, take Mr. Watson's bag.

MOTHER

Hello, honey? That scruffy-looking

man is out in the yard again.

DADDY

Luckily, Johnson just walked in to

relieve me. I'll be right out

there!

BUDDY

Rose, you must know who the fellow

is.

ROSE

(innocently)

Well, he might be that man who

followed me home from the store the

other day. But I don't know who he

is, Buddy, I really don't.

DADDY

Come back here, sir! Come back

here, you!

DADDY

I couldn't catch him. He ran like a

deer.

ROSE

I don't know him.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

Yes?

BILLY

Is Rose here?

MOTHER

She must have gone out for a walk

with the children.

BILLY

(sullenly)

Well, I got to see her.

MOTHER

She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but

Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to

have callers during working hours.

BILLY

(sullenly)

Where is she?

MOTHER

I said she isn't here. NOW you go

home. Be a nice boy and go home.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

That sulky boy was here again this

afternoon. I was almost scared, he

wouldn't go away.

DADDY

(throws his napkin on

table)

Rose, my patience is wearing thin.

First a scruffy man who runs like a

deer and now a sulky boy who wont

go away. This is getting to be a

regular monkey and dog show.

ROSE

I swear to God I don't know who in

the world he is. Really, I don't, I

don't know no boy like that, I

don't.

MOTHER

(finally, in a small

voice)

Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys

and men like her. You cant blame

her for that, hon.

DADDY

Rose, I realize you don't know this

boy, but if you know anybody who

does know him, if you have even a

faint clue as to who he might be,

then convey to him that he had

better stay away from my house and

stop scaring my wife... and I don't

mean maybe.

BUDDY

(listening)

Chattanooga. I had St. Louis,

Missouri.

DOLL

Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

BUDDY

So am I.

DOLL

She hasn't got any sense. In some

ways, she's awful dumb.

BUDDY

(takes off earphones,

gives it a moment of

grave consideration, then

his opinion)

It isn't that she hasn't got any

sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence

is probably above average, maybe

quite a bit above average.

DOLL

Then why does she act so dumb?

BUDDY

Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll.

And neither does smartness. You see

--

FIRST MAN'S VOICE

You son of a bitch, what are you

doing here?!

SECOND MAN'S VOICE

I'd like to ask you the same

question, you bastard!

FIRST MAN'S VOICE

I told you to stay away from her,

goddamn you!

SECOND MAN'S VOICE

You got no right to tell me to stay

away from her, I knew her before

you did!

BUDDY

Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh boy. Daddy

isn't going to like this.

FIRST MAN'S VOICE

She told you to leave her alone,

didn't she?

SECOND MAN'S VOICE

Like hell she did! You're the one

she wants to get shed of!

BUDDY

Come on!

FIRST MAN'S VOICE

You'll swallow teeth yourself if

you don't leave her alone, you ugly

bastard! Go on, throw one, throw

one!

SECOND MAN'S VOICE

I'll throw one, you son of a bitch!

DADDY

All right, I have got a Parker

shotgun here and it is loaded and

the trigger is cocked and wherever

you birds are and whatever you are

doing you had better get the hell

out of here goddamned quick!

DADDY (CONT'D)

And do not come back, you sons of

bitches! Stay away from my house

and home and my wife and children

or I'll blow your goddamned heads

off!

DADDY

You children go to bed. And

Brother, stay away from Rose, I'll

speak to her in the morning.

ROSE

(rather feebly, as if it

explains something)

I got an awful toothache.

BUDDY

(quietly)

Rose, if you don't keep your

boyfriends away from the house,

Daddy is going to fire you.

ROSE

(innocently)

But I don't know who they are.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

Well, Rose, my sleep was a little

disturbed last night, and so was

Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the

children's. How about you? Was your

sleep disturbed, too?

ROSE

(solemnly)

Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I

heard strange voices in the night.

DADDY

(softly strumming fingers,

finally)

Strange voices, Rose?

ROSE

(innocent as an angel)

Yes, sir.

DADDY

(still aloofly polite)

Now Rose, stop behaving as if

you're Bo Peep. Those men had a

flight last night because of some

female in this house, and it wasn't

Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.

MOTHER

(very tense)

I don't think we ought to discuss

this in front of the children.

ROSE

(weeping, a hand over her

eyes)

Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe...

one of 'em... was Foster... but I

don't hardly know him!

DADDY

Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth

and quit crying!

MOTHER

(draws herself up)

I will not sit here and listen to

you be brutal to this poor girl.

DADDY

I am not being brutal to her!

MOTHER

You certainly are! She has an awful

toothache, look at her jaw, it's

all swollen.

DADDY

(trying to restrain

himself, aloofly polite

to the utmost)

Darlin', it is not my fault if the

girl has epizootics --

DADDY (CONT'D)

-- I am not responsible for her

epizootics and I did not bring

about her epizootics. Now listen to

me. When I have to get up in the

middle of the night and defend my

home with a shotgun against a

couple of damned scoundrels

fistfighting in the bushes --

MOTHER

Scoundrels? They weren't

scoundrels, they were just boys.

DADDY

Boys? You say to me boys?

MOTHER

Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they

were boys! Boy friends of Rose,

chat's what they were, and why

shouldn't she have boy friends? Do

you want her to be unnatural? Don't

you think she's human the same way

you are yourself? It's the South,

that's what it is, the South with

its horrible traditions, of slavery

and crime and the oppression of

women, who are just as good as men

and just as human!

DADDY

(his eyes are a trifle

glazed)

Now darlin', what has the South got

to do with this?

MOTHER

(in a real snit, afraid he

will fire Rose)

And when I try to talk to you

seriously, when I try to explain to

you the unlimited creative power of

life, how beautiful it would be if

we gave up this hopeless struggle

and simply loved each other from

our hearts, what do you do -- you

mock me!

DADDY

(mildly, his eyes are even

more glazed)

I don't intend to mock you, dear. I

respect your philosophy. It's

beyond my comprehension, but I

respect it.

ROSE

(head bowed, weeping in a

little handkerchief)

Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

DADDY

(exasperated)

Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your

cornflakes!

ROSE

(piteously)

I'm not hungry.

DADDY

Now you listen to me, Rose --

MOTHER

(with fire in her eyes)

Just a moment! You are not going to

fire this girl for an innocent

thing like having boy friends, not

while there is breath in my body!

DADDY

I don't intend to fire her,

darlin'.

MOTHER

It isn't her fault if she's

popular... what?

DADDY

I said I don't intend to fire her.

I just want to ask her to keep her

boy friends away from my home and

hearth, that's all.

MOTHER

(simmers down at once, now

calmly)

Well, that's very reasonable. Howe

I hate to bring it up, but she's

got an awful toothache, we've got

to carry her to the dentist.

ROSE

I don't want to go to the dentist.

MOTHER

Be quiet, Rose.

DADDY

Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the

hotel. You and Brother can handle

the girl's epizootics. I'll just

say one more thing.

(turns to Rose and, in a

grave tone)

Rose, I told you you had a friend

in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she

would fight for you like a tiger?

ROSE

(meekly)

Yes, sir.

DADDY

All right, thanks to her, and

thanks to this case of epizootics,

you are getting another chance.

(points a finger at her,

and sternly)

But don't try my patience again. We

have growing children in this

house. Do you understand me?

ROSE

Yes, sir.

MOTHER

Poor thing. Does the ice help,

Rose?

ROSE

Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't

never been to no dentist before.

He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

MOTHER

No, Rose, he'll help you.

DR. WINTON

Nurse says we have a nervous

patient. Now, young lady, be calm.

First of all, let me tell you, I am

not going to hurt you.

ROSE

Yes, you are.

DR. WINTON

No, I am not.

ROSE

Look, you can't kid me.

MOTHER

(rises, takes her by the

hand)

Now, come on, Rose. Stop being so

childish, come on.

ROSE

I'm not goin' in there, I don't

like the looks of it!

MOTHER

(annoyed)

Rose, sit down in that chair and be

quiet! We're trying to help you,

you silly creature, sit in that

chair!

ROSE

(very reluctantly sits in

chair)

Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna

kill me.

DR. WINTON

You and the boy wait outside.

DR. WINTON

Well, she finally let me look in

her mouth. Is it true she's never

been to a dentist?

MOTHER

She was raised on a poor dirt farm.

I'm sure she's never seen a dentist

or hardly even a doctor.

DR. WINTON

Well, she has one mouth in ten

thousand, I don't see teeth like

that once in ten years. Her trouble

is an impacted wisdom tooth, but

there isn't a cavity in her head,

not a single one. She has perfect

teeth.

MOTHER

But the wisdom tooth will have to

be pulled?

DR. WINTON

Yes, and it's very bad. It probably

should be done at the hospital

under general anesthesia.

MOTHER

That would scare her to death.

She's terrified of hospitals. To

her, a hospital is where you go to

die.

DR. WINTON

I think you're right, it would be

harder on her. But you'd better

call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to

need help to get home.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

(a whisper, muffled by the

bloody gauze)

Never again, never again...

MOTHER

(with pity, gently)

I know it was bad, honey. I'm

sorry...

ROSE

No more dentists, no more

dentists...

MOTHER

It'll get better now.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

Good morning, Rose. And how do you

feel today?

ROSE

Wonderful. Except I can touch the

place back there with my tongue, I

wouldn't even know I had that tooth

pulled.

DADDY

(dryly, as he looks at

mail)

Well, I know it, I just got the

bill for it.

ROSE

Boy, for four or five days there I

didn't think I'd live. But I'm my

old self again!

DADDY

Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange

voices in the night, Rose.

ROSE

Oh, no, sir.

MOTHER

Rose has learned her lesson,

haven't you, Rose?

ROSE

Yes, ma'am.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

I see my mother-in-law's face, son.

Read 'em and weep, boy, I am

playing a spectacular combination,

a triple. The nine ball in the

corner!

(takes his stance with cue

as Shadrach walks up)

Read 'em and weep, boy, that's all

she wrote.

SHADRACH

Mistah Hillyer, the Chief of Police

wants you on the telephone.

DADDY

(about to make his shot,

looks around)

The Chief of Police?

SHADRACH

Yassuh.

DADDY

Rose is in jail. She bit a

policeman's thumb. Come on, son,

Shadrach can run the hotel.

CHIEF OF POLICE

That was a awful brawl down at the

Busy Beaver, Mr. Hillyer. You know

that fat Horton, the bootlegger?

DADDY

Yes, I know the son of a bitch.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Son of a bitch is right, he dern

near killed a man. And this girl

was the cause of it all. What's

more, she bit a police officer's

thumb right to the bone.

DADDY

Well, Rose, what have you got to

say for yourself?

ROSE

(coughs, then feebly)

I got an awful bad cold.

DADDY

(nods slowly, then with

aloof politeness)

That's all you've got to say,

you've got a bad cold?

ROSE

(coughs again)

Well, I don't know what happened.

They were arguin' about baseball,

then all of 'em started fightin'.

As for that policeman, I didn't

bite him, I don't think I bit him.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Well, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.

You want me to release her in your

custody?

DADDY

No, not really. But I guess we'll

have to do that, John. Let her out.

Let the crazy creature out and I'll

take her home.

ROSE

I got an awful cold, I think I'm

sick.

ROSE

I didn't mean to bite him. He was

hitting Horton with a blackjack in

the meanest way and... and I bit

him accidental.

DADDY

(stops the car, turns to

Rose)

I have to go back to the hotel. I'm

on duty at the desk and who knows a

quest might arrive. I will see you

at suppertime, Rose.

ROSE

(a feeble smile)

I didn't mean to bite him, I really

didn't.

DADDY

I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

ROSE

(feebly)

Yes, air.

DISSOLVE TO:

DOLL

(turns around on piano

stool, to Buddy)

What is Rose going to do? Where can

she go?

BUDDY

They've been in there the longest

kind of time. I can't stand it, I

gotta find out what's going on.

DOLL

You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill

you!

DADDY

I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as

much as you do.

MOTHER

(wanly)

Well, she does seem to cause a lot

of trouble, I admit. But she

doesn't mean any harm and it'll

break the children's hearts, they

all love her.

DADDY

It's because of the children she's

got to go. I don't want to be

holier-than-thou, but the girl

doesn't have the same outlook we

do. Morals don't mean a thing to

her, not a thing, and we can't have

a girl like that in this house.

MOTHER

Who is to say our morals are better

than hers?

(frowns, sighs)

But maybe you're right. She

could... influence Dolly...

DADDY

That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

(pauses, and firmly)

The girl has got to go, darlin'.

MOTHER

But morals come from the heart, not

from rigid rules and empty laws.

And in her heart Rose has never

hurt anyone and she never would.

Therefore, she's not immoral. Not

really.

DADDY

Now look, darlin', this is no time

to go off into the fourth

dimension.

MOTHER

But what I said is the simple

truth. And now I see something

else, I see more deeply into it...

DADDY

Just a moment, darlin'.

DADDY

Could of sworn that boy was out

here.

MOTHER

How could Rose really be a bad

influence on Dolly? She has a

loving nature, you ought to want

someone like that around your

children. Why do you think those

boys and men like her?

DADDY

Well, I have a pretty good idea.

MOTHER

If you mean sex, you couldn't be

more wrong. Rose likes those boys

and men, she has love in her heart,

and that is what they want. It's

the most rare and beautiful thing

in life and that is why they follow

her.

DADDY

They follow her because she's a --

(he is about to say "piece

of tail," but interrupts

himself)

-- no, I won't say that.

MOTHER

What she doesn't understand is that

her behavior is disturbing to other

people. She's young, she's got to

learn to restrain the life force

that's in her. Its creative, but in

her case it's too creative.

DADDY

Darlin', Rose has got to go!

MOTHER

(rises)

I'll talk to her, I'll reason with

her.

DOLL

What's happening?

BUDDY

Mother is struggling desperately.

In fact she's fighting like a

tiger. But I don't know, it's

close, it's mighty close.

DOLL

(pauses, then in a low

tone, slightly wide-eyed)

Buddy... does Rose really... "do

it" with all those boys and men?

BUDDY

(aloofly, like Daddy)

Doll, don't ask childish questions.

WASKI

(indignantly, to Doll)

Of course not!

BUDDY

Oh, Waski, you don't even know what

we're talking about.

MOTHER

Rose, you're very sick. You're

burning up. Rose, can you hear me?

Rose?

ROSE

(semi-delirious)

What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?

ROSE

Buddy! Dolly! They're takin' me to

the hospital! Don't let 'em, don't

let 'em!

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

(a feeble whisper)

Pray for me...

DR. MARTINSON

Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is

strong as an ox and that is what is

keeping her alive. But not many

people walk away from double

pneumonia, Madam, not many.

MOTHER

She looks terrible, just awful.

DR. MARTINSON

Of course she does and I must say

I'm puzzled by your delay in

getting her to the hospital. I

should think ordinary powers of

observation would have suggested to

you that she was seriously ill.

MOTHER

She hid it from us, Doctor. She's

afraid of the hospital.

DR. MARTINSON

(a thin superior smile)

Afraid of the hospital?

MOTHER

Deathly afraid of it. Her people

were poor tenant farmers and she

doesn't know anything about doctors

or medicine or hospitals.

DR. MARTINSON

(frowns in open disbelief)

A tenant farm? Are you trying to

tell me that girl is a product of

the hookworm and pellagra belt?

MOTHER

Well, her people were very poor.

She says she was often hungry as a

child, and I'm sure the food she

ate was pretty awful, not a

balanced diet at all.

DR. MARTINSON

Exactly, and that's why she

couldn't possibly have come from

such a farm.

DADDY

(icily polite)

Excuse me, sir, are you calling my

wife a liar?

MOTHER

(embarrassed)

Honey, please...

DR. MARTINSON

(a thin unpleasant smile)

It's simply that I find it

incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from

the girl's illness at the moment,

she is very strong, a very healthy

specimen of a young human female --

and a comely one, too. She must

have gotten protein somewhere as a

young child, if only sporadically.

MOTHER

It is kind of amazing. The dentist

says she has perfect teeth, there

isn't a cavity in her mouth.

MR. MARTINSON

(tries to make a

supercilious joke)

Her entire mouth is a cavity,

Madam, ha ha ha.

DADDY

(dryly, doesn't like the

man a bit)

Ha ha ha ha.

DR. MARTINSON

(with spurious dignity)

The point is you don't grow up like

that on a diet of sorghum and

hominy grits. She got protein

somewhere, she's a very strong girl

and I think she'll live... despite

the delay in medical treatment.

DADDY

That's all I want to know.

(rises)

Lets get out of here before I get

the epizootics myself. Thank you,

Doctor, for your discourse, it was

fascinating, no doubt.

MOTHER

Yes, thank you, Doctor.

DR. MARTINSON

(as they leave)

I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do

you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an

animal epidemic?

DADDY

(icily polite, from the

door)

No, I mean epizootics.

DADDY

I can't stand that polecat. They

ought to hang him.

MOTHER

You don't like him because he's a

Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.

DADDY

He's a polecat, dear.

DADDY

Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in

that bed.

(sighs, shakes his head)

I hope she'll be all right, but I

still think we ought to fire her.

MOTHER

I don't see how you can even think

of it now.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside,

and so unhappy with that rich wife

who doesn't understand him, her

being a Southerner and everything,

and what a bedside manner he has

got -- so gentle and kind beneath

the professor way he acts!

BUDDY

Rose, you are too uncritical of

people.

ROSE

You don't know the bedside manner

that man has got. Why, it does me

good just to see him sit there all

solemn and go pokin' in his bag

like he's gonna cure me, which he

did of course. And even more

important he loves me, like a

patient I mean, the other day he

got tears in his eyes just

listenin' to my heart beat.

BUDDY

He did?

ROSE

Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw

'em, and a little bit he says to

me, "You know, you are beautiful."

Now wasn't that a nice thing for a

doctor to say to a patient, wasn't

it? What could cheer a girl up

more?

BUDDY

Rose, I have got doubts about that

doctor and so does Daddy.

ROSE

He's got doubts about hisself and

that's the saddest thing of all.

Would you believe that poor man

thinks nobody likes him?

BUDDY

Yeah, I'd believe it.

ROSE

Well, I like him. I used to be

afraid of doctors but not any more.

Why, he could operate on me any old

time and I wouldn't even be scared.

BUDDY

Rose, you are just entirely too

uncritical of people.

ROSE

I ain't neither. Listen here,

Buddy, besides all his vast medical

knowledge, he has the most kindest

heart beneath the professor way he

acts -- he wants justice in the

world and he's got some real

interestin' ideas.

MOTHER

Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a

lot better, I just gave her her

supper. She's almost all well now.

DR. MARTINSON

Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

MOTHER

Yes. Well. She's upstairs.

ROSE

Justice, that's what he wants,

justice for everybody and

especially for niggers. And I think

that's real nice of him because

black people don't have a very good

life, you got to admit that, to be

a nigger is sometimes practic'ly

fatal, but the wife don't

understand all of that, she thinks

niggers are just so much dirt,

which anybody ought to know better

if they been on their ass their

ownselves -- and that is the cause

of his profound unhappiness, Buddy,

that no-good-mean wife with all her

Southern prejudice against niggers

and everything!

MOTHER

The Doctor is here. And Brother,

supper is ready.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

Is that Doctor still up there,

Brother.

BUDDY

Yeah, he's still up there.

DADDY

What's taking the rascal so long?

MOTHER

Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a

rascal, he's one of the finest

physicians in Glenville. He studied

at Johns Hopkins University.

DADDY

I don't care where the polecat

studied.

MOTHER

Sometimes the negativism and

cynicism in you makes me want to

vomit.

(shakes her head sadly as

Buddy surreptitiously

puts his napkin on table)

Your real trouble is that you're

anti-intellectual. The irony is

women are supposed to be emotional,

but I never saw anybody who

depended more on emotion and

prejudice than you do.

BUDDY

(a half audible murmur)

Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.

MOTHER

Now I have a plan about Rose, an

educational plan. She's getting

better and we don't want any more

trouble --

(notices Buddy slipping

out)

Brother, you ought to hear this.

BUDDY

I'll be right back.

MOTHER

First, those clothes she wears.

They're too provocative. I've

talked to her a lot about it and I

think she understands...

DADDY (O.S.)

Everything all right, Doctor?

DR. MARTINSON

Oh, yes. Yes. Just fine. A few more

days... a little more rest...

she'll be perfectly healthy.

DADDY

(in a low, conspiratorial

tone)

What do you think, Brother?

BUDDY

I don't know. But you better watch

him like a hawk, if he comes back

again.

DADDY

He's not coming back again. We

scared the rascal off, son.

(puts a hand on Buddy's

shoulder)

Come on back to supper. Your mother

has a theory about how to educate

Rose.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

You see, Rose? Now that's the kind

of dress you ought to wear.

ROSE

(less than enthusiastic)

Yeah, it's kinda nice.

MOTHER

You look very pretty in it, Rose.

Really, you do.

ROSE

(smiles at Mother)

Well, you're real sweet to make it

for me.

(puts an arm around

Mother's shoulder)

There never was nobody like you.

And you don't need to worry, I

ain't goin' out no more.

MOTHER

Well, there's no reason you

shouldn't go out, Rose... in

moderation.

ROSE

(a little shrug)

I don't want to. When I was lyin'

there in that hospital bed at

death's door I says to myself, I

ain't goin' out no more. If I ever

get outta this, I'll just stay

home.

ROSE (CONT'D)

(rather sadly)

Besides, there ain't no Mr. Right

out there. Or if there is I can't

find him, all I find is a pile of

Mr. Wrongs. I ain't goin' out no

more.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

All right, we'll play monopoly

then.

MOTHER

She's like a different person.

Being so sick made a big impression

on her. I really think she's

learned a lesson.

DADDY

Um-hmm.

(waits as Mother goes on

up steps, then turns to

Buddy and in a low tone)

Come with me, Brother. I want to

show you something.

DADDY

See that, son? Now this is a heel,

see, and there, that's the ball of

a foot. Someone has been walking

here.

BUDDY

(reluctantly)

Well, it's not very plain.

DADDY

That is because it rained recently,

the rain has obscured the evidence.

But you could still take plaster

casts of these footprints, then

match up the plaster casts with

whosever shoes they are, and that

way you could catch him --

understand?

BUDDY

But how would you find him?

DADDY

Well. Well, what I mean is, you

could prove it was his shoes if you

did catch him. But look this,

Brother, it is even more

interesting. Look at this mark

here, and that mark over there. Now

wouldn't you say those marks are

the marks of a ladder?

BUDDY

Well, I don't know.

(trying to sound like a

fellow detective, but

doesn't want Rose to get

caught)

No, I don't know, Daddy, I think

the rain has obscured it.

DADDY

True, but if you look sharply you

can see that those marks are the

marks of a ladder. Now let's go

back to the garage and see if the

ladder has been tampered with.

DADDY

(points to ladder, eyes

narrowed)

See, son? The paint is flaked off

here, freshly. Look at it, Brother,

there is no question about it. Some

person or persons unknown have very

recently tampered with this ladder.

BUDDY

Well... maybe...

DADDY

And there's only one reason anybody

would want this ladder -- to get up

into Rose's bedroom in the dark of

night! I am going to chain up this

ladder and padlock it! -- and that

is not all I am going to do!

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

That was a delicious repast, Rose,

as usual. Now I have something of

grave import to say to you and to

Mrs. Hillyer.

(pauses, points at Buddy)

And I don't want you children

snooping, do you hear me, Brother?

Go up to your rooms.

DADDY

We all love you, Rose. Even more

now, since you've bravely

surmounted all these epizootics. We

admire you, we esteem you, we hold

your hand with love and affection,

we have an investment in you -- and

I don't mean money, although God

knows we have that, too,

considering those godawful hospital

bills...

BUDDY

He's not going to fire her.

DADDY

I mean a human investment, Rose, we

care about you, you matter to us.

But we have innocent and unformed

children in this house and the

monkey and dog show has got to

stop. Do you hear me?

ROSE

(meekly)

Yes, sir.

MOTHER

(a bit overwhelmed by

Daddy)

She hasn't actually done

anything...

DADDY

(very firmly)

Just a moment, dear.

(turns to Rose and almost

sadly)

We can't have it, Rose. Can you

behave yourself -- or not? That is

the question, to behave or not to

behave, to suffer the slings and

arrows of outrageous chastity and

keep your skirt down or to hoist it

in the light of the moon and make

whoopee -- that is the coil

shuffling question.

(a dramatic pause, then

points at her)

If you can't behave I am going to

fire you and I say it in front of

you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it.

I point my rigid finger right at

your nose, Rose, and I stare

unwaveringly into your big blue

eyes and I tell you... this is a

final warning. Do you hear me?

ROSE

(very meekly)

Yes, sir.

DOLL

Well, if she's got any sense at

all, she'll listen to that.

BUDDY

Sense doesn't mean anything to

Rose. But I think we're on safe

ground now. Daddy chained up the

ladder, whoever it is can't get in

the house.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY (O.S.)

Open that door! Open it up, open it

this instant! Do you hear met open

that door!

DADDY

Rose! Rose! Open this goddamn door!

Open it or I'll break it down!

DADDY (CONT'D)

Open that door, damn you!

BUDDY

Daddy, what's the matter?

DADDY

(glances around at him)

She's got somebody in there,

Brother! His shoes are on the back

porch -- there they were, naked and

smiling at me!

(bangs on door)

Rose, open this door immediately!

DADDY (CONT'D)

Open up, Rose! Procrastination

won't help you!

DADDY (CONT'D)

(he pushes past her)

All right, where is he? Where's the

culprit?

DADDY

Where is he? I know he's in here,

where is he, Rose? His shoes were

on the back porch I smiling at met

Where are you, you son of a bitch?

ROSE

(feebly, she is terrified)

There ain't nobody here, Mr.

Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!

DADDY

Where is he? Where have you got him

hid?

(notices curtain blowing

in wide open window)

Ah, ha!

DADDY

And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?

ROSE

Well, it's Billy.

DADDY

And what, may I ask, was Billy

doing here?

ROSE

(a straight answer)

Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very

poor, he don't have no money and

there wasn't no place else to go.

DADDY

Well, it was a silly question.

ROSE

He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He

wants to be a fireman.

DADDY

Ye gods and little fishes, a

fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose,

you're naked as a jay bird. When

you're dressed, come on downstairs.

I'm afraid your friend Billy is

injured, where are his clothes?

ROSE

(begins weeping, both

breasts now are exposed)

Under the mattress. I hid 'em so

you wouldn't be mad. He wants to

marry me, he loves me. I can't

marry him, he's too young and

hasn't got no job, but he loves

me... now you wouldn't hurt him,

would you?

DADDY

I won't hurt him, honey.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and

I hadn't ought to of done it. But

I'm only a human girl and I... I

ain't always perfect. I promise I

won't let him in the house no more,

I promise. Won't you and Mrs.

Hillyer forgive me?

DADDY

Rose, darlin', you break my heart.

But I am only a human man myself of

the father variety. Rose, pack your

bag, baby, as of this moment you

are hired, mired and fired.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

(politely)

Well, Rose, going out to look for a

job today?

ROSE

(eyes down)

What's the use, there ain't none.

DADDY

Mmm. Would you get me another half

a-cup of coffee, dear?

DADDY (CONT'D)

It has been three weeks since I

"fired" her. Is there no way to get

rid of this girl? Are we stuck with

her for life?

MOTHER

She can't get a job, it's a

depression. And we can't just throw

her out on the street.

DADDY

The hell we can't.

MOTHER

Rose, you don't look well and you

haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

ROSE

I'm not hungry. I can't eat

nothin', I haven't been able to eat

since I got fired. I think maybe

I'm sick.

DADDY

God forbid. You're not sick, Rose,

forget it. Don't get any notions in

your head, you're not sick.

ROSE

Yes, sir.

MOTHER

She does look a little peaky.

DADDY

No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine.

She's perfectly healthy, don't give

her ideas.

ROSE

Well, I'll do the dishes, then I'm

goin' to lie down a minute and

rest. My stomach hurts.

DADDY

Her plan is obvious, plain as day.

She's going on a hunger strike. The

question is, how do we foil her?

MOTHER

She's just nervous and worried. And

you would be, too, if you had no

job and no place to go.

DADDY

(thinking hard)

Something has got to be done or

Rose is going to be in this house

forever.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

(as if everyone will be

pleased)

Well, I have got news! I called

long distance and spoke to Cousin

Hop and you'll be glad to know,

Rose, I have found you a job!

ROSE

Tennessee?

DADDY

Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!

ROSE

Well. What kinda job is it?

DADDY

Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a

fine, outdoor-type job.

ROSE

You mean a farm?

DADDY

No, no, not exactly. It isn't a

farm in the sense that it's a farm.

Not at all. It's a... dairy

establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm

sure you'll like it because it's

so... peaceful!

MOTHER

Honey, Rose was born on a farm and

has terrible memories of farm life.

Now I don't think --

DADDY

Just a minute, Rose, you don't

understand. This isn't a dirt farm

like the one you were born on, it's

nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I

talked to him on the phone, a fine

man... it's not a farm, damn it,

it's a beautiful dairy

establishment! Stop crying, Rose!

Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's

ideal!

MOTHER

I don't know how you can call it

ideal -- don't you know what the

word "farm" means to her?

DADDY

I don't give a hoot in hell's

hollow what it means to her! She

can't stay in this house forever! I

fired her, damn it!

MOTHER

It sounds like a farm to me.

Calling it a dairy establishment,

that's just trickery and flummery.

DADDY

Trickery and flummery or not, she's

going there tomorrow on the bus!

It's settled! And I must say we've

been more than fair to you, Rose,

it's pretty selfish and mean

hearted of you to sit there and cry

like that!

ROSE

I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm

cryin' because of somebody else.

DADDY

(stops in mid-air, so to

speak)

What?

DADDY

What did you say, Rose?

ROSE

Well, I was born on a farm

myself... and I hate to think of

the baby being born on one.

DADDY

What baby? What baby? What baby are

you speaking about?

ROSE

Mine.

DADDY

Your baby?

ROSE

Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

DADDY

(he is "poleaxed,"

staggered)

Good God almighty. This is a

catastrophe, they won't hire her.

MOTHER

(looks up, sees Buddy in

patio window)

Brother, get out of that window!

DADDY

(stares off groggily into

space)

This is a total catastrastroke. As

of this moment I am stumped, I

admit, I am stumped and treed both,

the hound dogs have me surrounded.

MOTHER

(as Rose begins crying)

Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know

you feel awful, but don't cry,

honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the

father, dear?

ROSE

Well, I... I... I don't know...

maybe it was... but no, you can't

be sure about a thing like that. It

wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

MOTHER

(gently)

I know it's embarrassing... but who

were you exposed to, dear?

ROSE

Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h,

that's kinda hard to say.

DADDY

You're not going to get anywhere

with that line of questioning. The

problem is, what are we going to

do?

MOTHER

That's why I'm asking her who the

father is. It's the most vital

question of all. Who's the father,

dear?

DADDY

(offhand; he is thinking

hard about what to do)

She already told you, she doesn't

know.

MOTHER

(naively)

But she must know... unless...

unless... Rose, was there more than

one person?

ROSE

(weeping in handkerchief)

Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't

think. I... I'm not really sure.

MOTHER

(gently, a tiny frown, a

bit shocked)

Rose, really, you shouldn't act

like that.

ROSE

(weeping)

Oh, I know. But I didn't, really.

Honestly, I didn't. There was only

one, but he's out of town and leave

no forwardin' address.

DADDY

(a brilliant idea)

Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No

forwarding address, huh?

(turns to Mother)

In the shock of this brilliant

move, I forgot something.

MOTHER

What did you forget?

DADDY

I forgot that Rose will lie like a

child. She's no more pregnant than

I am, she just doesn't want to go

to that farm!

ROSE

Yes, I am.

DADDY

No, you're not.

ROSE

Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.

DADDY

(triumphant, sure he's

right)

All right, tell us, Rose, what

makes you think you're pregnant?

ROSE

(simply)

I haven't had my period for three

months and my stomach is getting

big.

DADDY

(again "poleaxed" for a

moment, but pulls himself

together)

I don't believe it.

ROSE

It's so, Mr. Hillyer.

DADDY

All right, damn it. We've seen you

with your clothes off around here,

stand up and pull up your dress and

let's take a look!

MOTHER

Honey!

DADDY

She doesn't have to take her

panties off, we can see her stomach

with 'em on. All she has to do is

pull up her dress and let us see

her belly.

ROSE

Well, all right, if you just won't

believe me.

MOTHER

Rose, you don't have to.

ROSE

I don't mind.

DADDY

Now, you will see, she's lying like

she always does -- that belly will

be flat as a pancake!

MOTHER

I'd say about three months. Are you

satisfied?

DADDY

I am poleaxed and in a non compos

mentis condition. I wash my hands

or the whole thing.

DOLL

What's goin' on?

BUDDY

Rose says she's goin' to have a

baby and she sure looks it, but I

don't think so.

DOLL

A baby... and she isn't even

married.

BUDDY

That's the least of her troubles.

Rose had a rare tropic disease and

the little tubes in her that babies

swim down are all stopped up, she

told me all about it.

DOLL

If it isn't a baby... what is it?

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all

up! They're gonna cut my stummick

all open, I'll die!

BUDDY

(trying to be brave)

You won't die, Rose.

ROSE

Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!

DR. MARTINSON

I'm not surprised you thought she

was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can

look very much like pregnancy. But

it was pure wishful thinking on her

part. The girl can never have

children, she had gonorrhea at

fifteen and it was untreated.

MOTHER

(shocked, rather feebly)

Gonorrhea?

DR. MARTINSON

Don't worry, Madam, she can't

infect your dear little kiddies.

She long ago fully recovered, but

the disease did irreparable damage.

The girl is permanently barren.

MOTHER

Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose,

what a life she has had.

DR. MARTINSON

We make our own lives, Madam. As

for malignancy, I don't think so,

it's very unlikely. I probably

shouldn't have even mentioned that

possibility to her.

MOTHER

(rather coldly, seems

disenchanted with him)

No, you shouldn't have, it was

needlessly cruel. She thinks she

has cancer and is going to die.

DR. MARTINSON

She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was

merely giving her the facts.

DADDY

Well, it's a disaster. I don't know

what to say, Doctor, I am floored.

How dangerous is the operation?

DR. MARTINSON

Any major operation is dangerous.

However, as we know from her

previous illness, she's a very

strong girl.

DADDY

Well, if it isn't malignant and she

can get through the operation all

right, it might be better than her

really being pregnant. She doesn't

even know who the father might have

been.

DR. MARTINSON

Oh, it's definitely better, beyond

question. A fatherless child, an

ignorant girl with no job, no

money, no home. It's fortunate, a

blessing really, and a stroke of

good luck for another reason I want

to mention to you.

MOTHER

(totally disenchanted with

the Doctor)

This conversation is making me a

little sick.

DADDY

Honey, that's no way to talk to the

Doctor, he's merely doing his job,

dear.

BUDDY

I gotta find out what they're

saying. You lie back and rest,

Rose, and I'll give you a report on

it.

ROSE

I don't want to know...

DR. MARTINSON

I'm sorry the truth nauseates you,

Mrs. Hillyer, because before you

leave there's a bit more of it I'd

like to put to you. This operation

provides a therapeutic opportunity

that I feel is quite important in

regard to this particular girl, who

suffers not only from an ovarian

cyst but from a certain

psychoneurotic condition as well.

MOTHER

What do you mean, what kind of

gobbledygook talk is that?

DADDY

Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am

following you.

DR. MARTINSON

(gives Mother an aloof

glance, then to Daddy)

First, about the girl's history.

Evidently she's been very

promiscuous since early childhood,

she has no control over her sexual

impulses. Furthermore, she is

permanently barren, she can't have

children.

DADDY

Go on, Doctor.

MOTHER

(quietly)

Yes, go on.

DR. MARTINSON

I am thinking particularly of the

other ovary. As a rule I don't

believe in removing it. The woman's

hormonal system is profoundly

disturbed, she is subject to

possibly serious depression, she

loses many of her secondary sexual

characteristics for example, her

breasts might shrink and become

flabby, facial hair might appear

along with a coarsening of the

features, and of course her sexual

drive is greatly diminished,

especially in a girl or young

woman. For these reasons I am

opposed to removing the other

ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

DADDY

I am ahead of you.

DR. MARTINSON

Then... may I speak quite frankly

with you, Mr. Hillyer?

DADDY

Please do.

DR. MARTINSON

I have of course observed the girl

in treating her.

DADDY

Of course.

DR. MARTINSON

I think we both know her.

DADDY

Yes, we know her.

MOTHER

What are you talking about? I don't

understand all this mumbo jumbo and

the funny looks on your faces.

DR. MARTINSON

Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in

more ways than one. She is an

extreme psychoneurotic with

uncontrollable sexual impulses. It

would be a mercy to spare her the

suffering she causes herself and

others. Therefore I recommend as a

therapeutic measure the removal of

her second ovary. It is ethically

and medically the only proper

decision in this case and I suspect

your husband agrees with me.

DADDY

Reluctantly, I do. It would be a

blessing to her and everyone else.

The girl is oversexed and I say --

spay her!

MOTHER

(slowly rises to her feet

and in a trembling voice)

Over... my... dead... body!

MOTHER (CONT'D)

Are you human beings or are you

some kind of male monsters? Is

there no limit to which you won't

go to keep your illusions about

yourselves?

DR. MARTINSON

(shrinking a little)

Illusions, Madam?

MOTHER

You'd go so far as to mutilate a

helpless girl who has no means to

defend herself, you'd go that far?

Don't you think I know what you've

just said and don't you think I

understand the dreadful and

revolting crime you've just

conspired to commit?

MOTHER (CONT'D)

I thought I knew you. I thought I

knew you better, I thought in your

heart you were a good and kind man.

Well, I can't believe what I've

just heard in this room. A

defenseless girl depending on you

for protection, and you propose to

mutilate and destroy her. How could

you listen even for a moment to

that sadistic man?

DADDY

(slightly shattered)

Well, now, darlin'... give me a

chance to defend myself.

MOTHER

I can't believe you really meant

it, if I did I'd want to die. You

aren't a male monster, that man is

but you aren't. Look me in the eye

and tell me, do you really want to

take Rose's womanhood away from her

when it's all she has got?

DADDY

Well, I... I hadn't thought about

it that much. I was thinking...

well, it's an idea, the girl is

oversexed, and...

MOTHER

Rose isn't oversexed, that's

ridiculous. If you're going to talk

nonsense, I don't want to talk to

you at all. Rose is exactly the

same as the rest of us, except more

so.

DADDY

Well, I know, more so. That's why I

was thinking... maybe she'd be

better off.

MOTHER

(with a quiet fury)

Better off? How could she ever find

love and happiness, if you did what

you're talking about? Are you

insane?

DR. MARTINSON

(rather feebly)

Now, may I say, I am against that

particular procedure, as a general

rule. But in a case of near

nymphomania, it doesn't seem

monstrous to me at all, but

medically advisable.

DADDY

Well, now, I admit... in Rose's

case, it would be cruel. If Rose

wasn't attractive and pretty...

well, it would probably be bad for

almost any young woman. I don't

know exactly what I was thinking

about, the doctor said it and it

sounded reasonable.

DADDY (CONT'D)

But you're right, darlin', you're

absolutely dead right, it would be

an awful and horrible thing to do.

I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I

didn't mean it.

MOTHER

I will not cry like a woman. If I'm

upset it's because of what my

husband said, not because of you.

You can't make me cry like a woman,

a woman has got just as much

intelligence and self-control as a

man. And you get this in your head.

If you hurt that girl, I'll hire

lawyers and sue you for malpractice

for every penny you have got, I'll

do my level best to ruin you. Do

you understand me?

DR. MARTINSON

(a sickly smile, he is

licked totally)

Yes, I understand you, but you have

misunderstood me completely.

MOTHER

(icy cold)

I understand you perfectly. You

leave that girl alone, you wretched

man, or you will be sorry.

DR. MARTINSON

(a foolish smile, as if

Mother has paid him some

kind of compliment)

Actually of course I won't operate,

I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy

will operate and of course he'll be

guided by your wishes in this

respect.

MOTHER

Let him be guided not by my wishes

and not by Rose's wishes, although

I am sure they are identical. Let

him be guided by the wishes of the

creative power of life itself,

because that is what has spoken

through me tonight.

DISSOLVE TO:

WASKI

(seems on verge of tears)

Mother... is Rose going to die?

MOTHER

(in a trembly voice)

No, Waski, she won't die, because

we are praying for her.

DOLL

Why is it taking so long?

BUDDY

Here comes Daddy.

DADDY

(philosophically)

Well, I thought I'd seen the limit,

but these are the most great, gaga

epizootics she's ever had.

MOTHER

How is she?

DADDY

Fine.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

You're looking very chipper this

morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?

ROSE

Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever

felt! Except for a big old scar on

my stummick, I wouldn't even know I

been in the hospital.

DADDY

(with mild irony, as she

pours him coffee)

Well, we know you were there. The

bill that hospital sent was

absolutely horrendous.

ROSE

(her smile fades a trifle)

Well, I'll pay you that back

sometime, Mr. Hillyer.

MOTHER

Don't worry about it, honey.

DADDY

Rose... I hate to be mean, but...

(another pause, then a

little shrug)

Oh, nevermind, forget it.

ROSE

(in a little sad voice)

What was it, Mr. Hillyer?

DADDY

(rises)

Nothing, Rose.

DADDY (CONT'D)

We all love you, darlin'.

MOTHER

Don't worry, honey, you'll find

something.

ROSE

I was offered that job as a

waitress.

MOTHER

Forget about it, I don't want you

working in one of those honky

tonks.

ROSE

Hi, Buddy.

(puts an arm around his

shoulders)

How's my sweetheart who never told

on me when I was bad?

BUDDY

Okay.

ROSE

(picks up a hollowed out

gourd)

Makin' homes for purple martins,

huh? We had 'em on the farm.

They're the prettiest things.

That's what I wish I was, a bird.

Just fly around catch bugs and have

a lot of fun.

BUDDY

What are you going to do, Rose?

ROSE

Take a little walk with me, huh?

ROSE

(as she stares at the

empty hutch)

I guess I'll work as a waitress,

Buddy. I done that before and it

got me in worse trouble than you

could know, but I can't stay here

no more. Why did you get rid of

your rabbits, Buddy?

BUDDY

They're dumb things. I got tired of

them.

ROSE

(smiles, touches chicken

wire)

Did you know when I was a child we

had pretty near five hundred

rabbits?

BUDDY

Five hundred rabbits?

ROSE

Yep, we had 'em in orange crates

all over. It was Daddy's dream. He

was goin' to get rich raisin'

rabbits. It was what killed Daddy.

He didn't drown hisself till a long

time later after Momma and Lunette

died of typhoid, but it was them

rabbits what killed him.

BUDDY

How did the rabbits kill him?

ROSE

He thought he could sell 'em, but

nobody but country folks eat

rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got

no money. We had to eat them dern

rabbits our own selves. Every dern

one, and it took about four years

to eat 'em all up.

BUDDY

(a little smile)

Well, that doctor said you got

protein somewhere and I guess he

was right.

ROSE

Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But

later on after Momma died and Daddy

wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',

I sure would of been glad for a

little rabbit stew. You know, I

oughtn't to of told you about what

Daddy done when I was a child.

Until them rabbits ruined him, he

was a real good man, Buddy.

BUDDY

What was your mother like?

ROSE

A saint just like your own mother.

She's up in heaven right now, her

and Lunette, there ain't no doubt

about it.

BUDDY

Maybe it was eating all those

rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.

ROSE

Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to

me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito

bite.

(stops, smiles, puts an

arm around his shoulders)

I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't

want sex, Buddy, girls want love.

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

It's twenty after one.

MOTHER

I don't understand it. Even in the

wild days she was never as late as

this.

DADDY

I'm afraid it's my fault. I made

her feel guilty this morning --

(glances around, sees

something in doorway)

Brother, what are you doing up?

BUDDY

I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose

come in?

DADDY

No, she hasn't.

(frowns, looks around)

I think I hear a car.

DAVE

(rather stiffly)

I want to thank you for a wonderful

afternoon and evenin'. Can I see

you in the mornin'?

ROSE

(a bit breathless)

Yes. Year you can, you sure can.

DADDY

Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

MOTHER

Who?

DADDY

You know Dave, his wife used to do

dressmaking for you before she

died.

ROSE

You'll never guess what happened!

(pauses, then

dramatically)

I have met Mr. Right! I been with

him all day and he loves me, I know

he does, he loves me and he's going

to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me

already!

MOTHER

Well... well, that's wonderful,

Rose.

ROSE

And who do you suppose he is? That

policeman who arrested me, the one

I bit! He is Mr. Right!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

And now Waski, are you and Buddy

and Dolly ready for some ice cream,

huh? Do you like picnics or don't

you?

WASKI

We like 'em! We love 'em!

DAVE

Well, it isn't a picnic, honey.

It's a barbecue.

ROSE

(a little smile)

Okay.

DAVE

A picnic doesn't involve roast

meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a

lot of roast meat.

ROSE (V.O.)

Well, all I know is there's ice

cream. And I'm gonna have me a

plate right now!

DAVE (V.O.)

Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your

appetite. Have some barbecue first.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVE

Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr.

Hillyer. No more police work, I'm

getting in the construction field.

DADDY

Good luck, Dave. And good luck to

you, too, Rosebud.

ROSE

(begins crying)

Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand

to say goodbye!

ROSE (CONT'D)

I love you all! Goodbye, Buddy!

Goodbye, Dolly! Goodbye, Waski!

ROSE (CONT'D)

Goodbye! Goodbye!

DISSOLVE TO:

DADDY

Well, thank God we are rid of her

at last. And the best thing of all

is that she's happy. The little nut

is happy, she found Mr. Right in

the nick of time!

MOTHER

Well, yes, she's happy. Of course

Dave doesn't have her life force,

not at all. There isn't much

furniture in his house, just a

table and one or two chairs,

whereas Rose has furniture coming

out of the windows.

DADDY

Honey, he is Mr. Right.

MOTHER

(slowly nods)

Yes, I think so. He adores her,

it's almost pitiful the way he

worships her. I just hope she isn't

too much for him.

MOTHER (CONT'D)

What do you think, Brother?

MOTHER (CONT'D)

What's the matter with him?

DOLL

(seems awed, staring down

at Buddy)

I don't know. I think he's cryin'!

MOTHER

(rather sadly)

Maybe Brother is right. Maybe so.

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLCOX HILLYER

(dryly, to himself)

Mr. Right. Dave Wilkie.

DADDY

Well, you rascal, where'd you come

from?

WILLCOX HILLYER

Hello, Daddy. How are you?

DADDY

About as good as can be expected

with one foot in the grave. Good to

see you, son.

(they shake hands)

Did you bring any of that Yankee

whisky with you?

WILLCOX HILLYER

It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's

Scotch.

DADDY

It's Yankee whisky to me.

DADDY (CONT'D)

How do you stand it up there, boy,

in all that ice and snow? What are

you, a polar bear?

WILLCOX HILLYER

I can use a drink after the plane

ride I had.

DADDY

Your wife and children are back in

New Hampshire in the snow?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(a little smile; it is

summer, there couldn't be

snow in New Hampshire)

Yeah, they're in the snow.

DADDY

Are they polar bears, too?

WILLCOX HILLYER

(frowns at cupboard)

Good God, the way you live here.

This place hasn't been dusted since

Mother died. Look at that goddamned

refrigerator.

DADDY

Got another twenty years in it,

boy.

(something seems to be

bothering him)

By the way, son, do you recall

Rose, that pretty blonde girl who

came to our house way back in 1935

or 1936 and caused such a damnable

commotion.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(frowns, turns and stares

at him)

Of course I recall Rose. In fact

I've been thinking of no one else

for the last hour and a half.

DADDY

How could that be, son?

WILLCOX HILLYER

Dave Wilkie of all people was

sitting by me on the plane -- her

first husband. It's funny you would

mention Rose. Did you hear from

her?

DADDY

(casually)

Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

You'll have the back bedroom, son,

Mother's old art room. Just be

careful going down the stairs you

don't break your Yankee neck.

WILLCOX HILLYER

What's all this about Rose? What do

you mean, you heard from her in a

manner of speaking?

DADDY

Oh, I heard from her, I got a

letter from her, she's fine. But

there is some sad news.

WILLCOX HILLYER

What sad news? Did her cancer come

back?

DADDY

Oh, no, no, she got all over that.

Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

WILLCOX HILLYER

Is her husband sick or something?

DADDY

No, it's another thing. I was going

to write you about it, but since

you were coming down anyway I

thought I'd wait till you got here.

What did Dave Wilkie have to say?

WILLCOX HILLYER

The pitiful son of a bitch said

Rose was a nymphomaniac.

DADDY

Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed

you?

WILLCOX HILLYER

You're damn right it incensed me,

the miserable bastard. He also said

the kikes and the niggers have

taken over Washington. D.C.

DADDY

(nods somberly)

Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's

pitiful like you say. When he lost

Rose it ruined the man, it

destroyed him totally when he lost

Rose.

WILLCOX HILLYER

He didn't lose her, he threw her

away.

DADDY

Yes, I guess he did. He threw her

away and it was the mistake of his

life.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(staring off pensively

into space)

You know, I don't know this town

any more. All this traffic, new

buildings, prosperity...

(pauses, almost as if in

pain)

Where have the years gone, Daddy?

Where is the little town I knew as

a boy?

DADDY

At rest in the creative universe

with Mother, son.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(a little smile)

That's what she would say herself.

DADDY

(simply, he is not

emoting)

A wonderful woman, boy.

WILLCOX HILLYER

It always gives me a funny feeling

to come home. Dear old Southland.

Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --

(a fond little smile)

-- except you, you're still here.

DADDY

(matter-of-factly)

Not for long, boy. I've outstayed

my welcome already.

WILLCOX HILLYER

It's funny you would mention Rose,

I was thinking about her all the

way up in the car.

(gives him a glance)

Or maybe it isn't so funny.

DADDY

(as if in previous

thought)

I'm older than hell, boy. But this

Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll

say that.

WILLCOX HILLYER

All right, Daddy. We have our

drink, we're out on the patio, you

have prepared me for it. Rose's

cancer has come back, hasn't it?

DADDY

(simply, quietly)

No, son, she is dead.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(numb with shock, for a

moment can't speak or

think)

Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she

died?

DADDY

I am afraid so, son. About a week

ago. Her husband phoned me, she had

asked him to call me if anything

happened.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(in awful shock)

But... but how? She was young! Rose

wasn't old!

DADDY

She was fifty-six, son. Of course

she didn't look it, nowhere near

it. The cancer came back, I'm

afraid I fibbed about that. But it

was very quick, son. She was in the

hospital only two weeks, and the

last week she didn't know anything.

WILLCOX HILLYER

(in distress, a slightly

choked voice)

Excuse me, I'll be right back.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

WILLCOX HILLYER

Well, you have knocked me for a

hell of a loop, old man. A hell of

a loop.

DADDY

(simply)

I know. You loved her. So did I. It

was an awful shock to me, too. An

awful shock. Rose was so alive it's

hard to believe.

WILLCOX HILLYER

I can't believe it, Daddy. I know

it must be true, but I can't

believe it.

DADDY

It's true, son. The girl with the

cornflower eyes is dead, she is no

more,

DADDY (CONT'D)

She got cancer of the breast, was

operated on and had a seven-year

recovery, then after a brief

illness passed on in her sleep, as

the man with whom she'd lived in

beautiful love and harmony for

twenty-five years held her hand.

That is what happened, son, and God

rest her lovely soul!

DADDY (CONT'D)

And now, if you are through with

that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the

Holiday Inn and get some dinner.

WILLCOX HILLYER

Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?

DADDY

Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd

want to?

WILLCOX HILLYER

That's a hell of a thing to say.

Why, Rose?

DADDY

(stops and firmly)

Now look, boy, get a grip on

yourself. Rose had a good life. She

found her. Right, didn't she? She

triumphed over everything, what are

you blubbering about?

WILLCOX HILLYER

I'm not blubbering.

DADDY

(gently)

Rose isn't dead, son. Not really.

Some of us die, but some of us

don't. Rose lives. As long as some

little girl somewhere gets herself

up and goes out, Rose lives.

THE END
