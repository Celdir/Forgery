REESE

(cutting her off)

Pay attention.  The 600

series had rubber skin.

We spotted them easy.  But

these are new.  They look

human.  Sweat, bad breath,

everything.  Very hard to

spot.  I had to wait 'til

he moved on you before I

could zero him.

SARAH

Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know.

They can't build anything like

that yet.

REESE

No.  Not yet.  Not for about

forty years.

SARAH

So, it's from the future, is

that right?

REESE

One possible future.  Four your

point of view.  I don't know the

tech stuff.

SARAH

And you're from the future too?

REESE

Right.

(patronizingly)

Right...

Listen.  Understand.  That

Terminator is out there.  It

can't be reasoned with, it can't

be bargained with...it doesn't

feel pity of remorse or fear...

and it absolutely will not stop.

Ever.  Until you are dead.

Can you stop it?

Maybe.  With these weapons...

I don't know.

gone.  There were survivors.

started it.

SARAH

I don't understand...

REESE

Defense network computer. New.

Powerful.  Hooked into everything.

Trusted to run it all.  They say it

got smart...a new order of intelli-

gence.  Then it saw all people as

a threat, not just the ones on the

other side.  Decided out fate in a

microsecond...extermination.

(continuing)

Didn't see the war.  I was born

after, in the ruins.  Grew up

there.  Starving.  Hiding from

Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines.

Build in automated factories.

Most of us were rounded up, put in

SKYNET.  A computer defense system

4800.

SILBERMAN

(gravely)

thinks it can win by killing

Shut up.

...it had no choice.

The defensive grid was

smashed. We'd taken the

Connor then would make no

difference.  Skynet had to

wipe out his entire exist-

ence.  We captured the lab

complex.  Found the...what-

ever it was called...the

time-displacement equipment.

The Terminator had already

gone through.  They sent two

of us to intercept, then

zeroed the whole place.

Sumner didn't make it.

make a career out of this guy.

You see how clever this part

is...how it doesn't require a

shred of proof.  Most paranoid

delusions are intricate...but

this is brilliant.

SILBERMAN

(recorded)

Why were the other two women

killed?

REESE

(recorded)

Most official records were

lost in the war.  The computer

knew almost nothing about

Connor's mother.  Her name.

Where she lived, just the city.

No scanner pictures.  The

Terminator was just being

systematic.

REESE

(recorded, con-

tinuing)

You've heard enough.  Decide.

Are you going to release me?

SILBERMAN

(recorded)

I'm afraid that's not up

to me.

REESE

(recorded/voice

rising)

Then why am I talking to you?

Get out.

SILBERMAN

(recorded)

I can help you...

REESE

Who is in authority here?

REESE

(recorded)

You still don't get it.

He'll find her.  That's

what he does.  All he does...

REESE

(recorded, con-

tinuing)

You can't stop him. He'll

wade through you...

REESE

(recorded, continuing)

...reach down her throat, and

pull her fucking heart out...

SILBERMAN

(glancing around)

Sorry.

SARAH

(turning)

So Reese is crazy.

SILBERMAN

In technical terminology,

he's a loon.

SARAH

But...

VUKOVICH

Sarah, this is body armor.

Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll

stop a 12 gauge round.  This

other individual must've had

one under his coat.

SARAH

But what about him punching

through the windshield?

TRAXLER

(shrugs)

Probably on PCP, broke every

bone in his hand and won't feel

it for hours.  There was this

guy once that...

VUKOVICH

Why don't you just stretch out

here and get some sleep.  It'll

take your mom a good hour to get

here from Redlands.

SARAH

I can't sleep.

VUKOVICH

Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're

thirty cops in this building.

SARAH

Okay.

You can't see here.  She's

Come here.

SARAH

Reese...you got a first name?

REESE

Kyle.

SARAH

Kyle, what's it like when you

go through time?

REESE

White light.  Pain.  Like

being ripped inside out...

slowly.  Like being born,

maybe.

SARAH

You're wet.  Oh my god.

REESE

I caught one, back there.

SARAH

(incredulous)

Caught one?  You mean you

got shot?

REESE

It's not bad.

SARAH

We gotta get you to a doctor.

REESE

It's okay.  Forget it.

SARAH

Forget it?  Are you crazy?

Let me see it.

SARAH

(continuing)

Jeez.  You idiot.  Take

this off.

REESE

(looking at the

wound)

See.  Missed everything.

Passed through the meat.

SARAH

This is gonna make me puke.

Talk about something.

REESE

What?

SARAH

Just talk.  Tell me about

my son.  Is he tall?

REESE

About my height.  He

has your--

(winces)

...damn...he has your

eyes.

SARAH

What's he like?

REESE

(thoughtful)

You trust him.  He's got that

strength.  You'd die in a

second for John.

SARAH

Well, at least I know what

to name him.  I don't suppose

you'd know who the father is?

So I don't tell him to get

lost when I meet him.

REESE

John never said much about

him.  He dies.  Even before

the war...

SARAH

(interrupting)

Stop!  I don't want to know.

Hold still.  So...it was John

that ordered you here?

REESE

I volunteered.

SARAH

You volunteered?

REESE

It was an honor.  A chance

to meet the legend.  Sarah

Connor.  Who taught her son

to fight...organize, prepare.

From when he was a kid.  When

you were in hiding, before

the war.

SARAH

You talk about things I haven't

done yet in the past tense.  It's

making me crazy.  I can't think.

(pause)

Are you sure you've got the

right person?

REESE

I'm sure.

SARAH

Come on, me? The mother

of the future?  Am I tough?

Organized?  I can't even balance

my checkbook.  I cry when I see

a cat that's been run over...

and I don't even like cats.

REESE

Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's

better tight.

SARAH

And anyway, what do I know

about guerrilla warfare?

REESE

You'll learn.

SARAH

(angry)

Look, Reese, I didn't ask for

this honor and I don't want it.

Any of it.

REESE

John gave me a message for

you.  Made me memorize it.

'Sarah"...this is the message...

'Sarah, thank you.  For your

courage through the dark years.

I can't help you with what you

must soon face, except to tell

you that the future is not set...

there is no such thing as Fate,

but what we make for ourselves

by our own will.  You must be

stronger than you imagine you

can be.  You must survive, or I

will never exist.'  That's all.

REESE

(continuing)

Good field-dressing.

SARAH

(brightening)

You like it?  It's my first.

REESE

Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

SARAH

(closing her

eyes)

Okay.  Talk some more.

REESE

About what?

SARAH

(murmuring)

About where you're from.

REESE

Alright.

(pause)

You stay down by day, but at

night you can move around.

The H-K's use infra-red so you

still have to watch out.

But they're not too bright.

John taught us ways to dust them

them.  That's when the infiltra-

tors started to appear.  The

Terminators were the newest,

the worst...

when we get through this.

beach, movies...matinees with

popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

REESE

Hot dogs?

I want to buy you a hot dog so

bad,Kyle...all the things you've

never seen and done.  You're here,

but wherever you go, and whatever

you touch, you bring the war with

you.

I want it to be over for you.

Not possible.

I want it to be over for me too.

No.

Never.

SARAH

I'm sorry.

So much pain.

Pain can be controlled.

You disconnect it.

SARAH

And so you feel nothing.

It's better that way.

sympathy)

Oh, Kyle.

John Connor gave me a picture

of you once.  I never knew

why.  It was very old. Torn.

Faded.  You were young, like

you are now.  You weren't

smiling...just a little sad...

I always wondered what you

were thinking at that second.

I'm not leaving you anywhere

it out?  Kyle, John is our

son.

SARAH

There isn't going to be

anybody else...I don't want

anybody else.  Listen to

Sure thing, officer.

What is it?

Microcomputer chassis.  But

I've never seen stuff like

this anywhere.

ASSISTANT

Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

Keep it out of sight and

get it down to R and D

Monday, first thing.

Good idea.

SARAH (V.O.)

...and the hardest thing is

deciding what I should tell

you and what not to.  Well,

anyway, I've got a while yet

before you're old enough to

understand the tapes.  They're

more for me at this point...

to help get it all straight.

SARAH

(continuing)

Should I tell you about your

father?  That's a tough one.

Will it change your decision

to send him here...knowing?

But if you don't send Kyle,

you could never be.  God,

you can go crazy thinking

about all this...I suppose

I'll tell you...I owe him that.

And maybe it'll be enough if

you know that in the few hours

we had together we loved a

lifetime's worth...

ATTENDANT

He says you are very beautiful,

Senora, and he is ashamed to ask

five American dollars for this

picture, but if he does not,

his father will beat him.

SARAH

That's a pretty good hustle,

kid.  Four.  Quatro.

ATTENDANT

Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars

American.

SARAH

What did he say?

ATTENDANT

(accented)

There is a storm coming in.

SARAH

(quietly)

I know.
