Randall Wallace

EARLY DRAFT

RAFE

Bandits at 2 o'clock.

DANNY

Power dive!

RAFE

It's Germans!

DANNY

Kill the bastards!

RAFE

Good shooting, Danny!

DANNY

Good shooting, Rafe!

RAFE

Land of the free...

DANNY

Home of the brave!

RAFE

There's another one!

DANNY'S FATHER

You no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',

said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel

his pig shed, and I can't find you no

place.

DANNY

Daddy, I told you I was comin' here.

DANNY

Da!... Dad...

RAFE

Let him alone!

DANNY

Rafe... Daddy... No!

RAFE

I'll bust you open, you...German!

DANNY'S FATHER

I fought the Germans.

DANNY

Daddy!  Daddy!  Wait.

RAFE'S FATHER

What's goin' on, son?

RAFE

Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get

him.

RAFE'S FATHER

Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?

RAFE

Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up

too?

RAFE'S FATHER

Sure will, son.

DISSOLVE TO:

TRAINING CAPTAIN

McCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!

RAFE

I thought this was a training flight.

I'm just trying to give Danny some

training.

DANNY

Not on your best day, boy!

TRAINING CAPTAIN

That's it, get into a wedge!

RAFE

Didn't you say test the limits?

DANNY

Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better

line up a couple dozen women on the

GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the

air!

TRAINING CAPTAIN

Everybody down!

TRAINING CAPTAIN

Where are McCawley and Walker?

TRAINING CAPTAIN

Aw shit...

TRAINING CAPTAIN

You know what they say... You can take the

crop duster out of the country -- but

don't put him in a P-40.

DANNY

If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --

RAFE

If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

ANTHONY

He's doing an inside loop!

TRAINING CAPTAIN

Aw, shit...

DANNY

Yee-hawww!!!

DANNY

Where's Rafe?

TRAINING CAPTAIN

You're down, Walker!  That's an order!

DANNY

What about him?

TRAINING CAPTAIN

He's not taking my orders anymore.

DANNY

He's gonna do it.

BILLY

Do what?

DANNY

It.

(beat)

Aw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

DANNY

I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

BILLY

Why?

DANNY

Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

TRAINING CAPTAIN

Aw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

ANTHONY & BILLY

Aw shit shit shit...

RED

Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

BILLY

Shit.

RED

Yeah.

DANNY

You can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.

DANNY

You could've killed yourself, you stupid

bastard!

DANNY

That was the most beautiful thing I ever

saw.

DOOLITTLE

There are some people who think the

outside loop is reckless and

irresponsible.

RAFE

How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if

you were the first man in the world to do

it?

DOOLITTLE

Don't get smart with me, son.

RAFE

Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous

only for the kind of pilot who wants to

show off, rather than inspire the other

pilots in his unit.  And all you've done

for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I

did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.

What the French call a "homage."

DOOLITTLE

That's bullshit, son.  But it's really

good bullshit.

RAFE

Thank you, Sir.

DOOLITTLE

Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire

your decision.

RAFE

Thank you, Sir.

BILLY

You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you

EVER die!

ANTHONY

That's your line for tonight, ya know.

BILLY

What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

ANTHONY

No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse

alone, you look her in the eye, and say,

"Baby, they're training me for war, and I

don't know what'll happen.  But if I die

tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all

we could tonight."  I've never known it

to fail.

RED

He's n-never known it to work, either.

DANNY

Doolittle didn't kill you?  Attaboy!

RAFE

Danny, there's something I gotta tell

you...

DANNY

How could you do this?

RAFE

The Colonel helped me work it out.

DANNY

I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,

I mean how the hell did you do it without

letting me in on it?

RAFE

I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only

accepting the best pilots.

DANNY

Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're

talking about war, and I know what war

does to people.

RAFE

Danny, you know how many times I saw you

come to school with a black eye or a

busted nose, and couldn't do a thing

about it -- for you, or for your mother...

or your father, with his lungs scorched

out with mustard gas, and more left of

his lungs than there was of his spirit?

You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's

time I made mine.

BILLY

(from the bus)

The nurses are waiting!

RAFE

Let's go.

DANNY

Nah, you go on.

RAFE

I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you

to meet her.

DANNY

Some other time.  I don't feel like a

party.

PILOTS VOICE

Nurses!  Nurses!  Nurses!

BETTY

Do you have trouble with your boobs in

the uniform?

BARBARA

You mean hiding them?

BETTY

Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm

talking about how you make them show!

SANDRA

Loan 'em to me, I'll make 'em show.

BETTY

The boobs or the pilots?

BARBARA

We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

BETTY

Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come

on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want

to know what we can expect.

EVELYN

I've been dating one pilot.  And only for

a few weeks.  But I know he's different

from all the others.

SANDRA

True love!...

BETTY

Morphine, give her morphine!

BARBARA

Give her an enema.

EVELYN

But I do have a warning for you.  There's

one line you all need to know, and you're

likely to hear it from any man in a

uniform.  It goes like this:  "Honey,

Baby... We never know what's gonna happen,

and I may die tomorrow...so, let's live

all we can tonight."

BARBARA

I tell you.  Any one of those arrogant,

leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys

tries that line on me...he's gonna get

anything he wants.

EVELYN

Stick with me, I'll find you somebody

good.

BETTY

I'll take that one.

EVELYN

He's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce

you.

RAFE

Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

EVELYN

You too, Lieutenant.

EVELYN

Oh, this is Betty.

RAFE

Nice to meet you, Betty.

RAFE

Danny would'a brought this.

EVELYN

Danny's not coming?

RAFE

No, he...got some news today.  He'll be

okay, he just didn't feel like coming

tonight.

EVELYN

I was hoping to meet him.

BETTY

I was hoping to meet him.

RAFE

We'll just have to find a substitute,

won't we?

BETTY

I just want to tell you one thing.  If

you're thinking this might be your last

night on earth?... I'm prepared to make

it meaningful.

(leaning close)

Very meaningful.

EVELYN

At ease, Betty!

RED

He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

BETTY

Red...Strange?

RED

You know the football player, Red G-

Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red,

cause you know, I'm red...and they

thought I was strange, so, you know, Red

G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

BETTY

But...they called you Strange?  Because

of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red

Grange strange?

RED

How would I know.

BETTY

Do you always stutter?

RED

Only when I'm n-n-n-

BETTY

Nervous?

RED

Yeah.  But if I have to get something

out, I c-can always s-s-s-

(he sings)

SIIING!

BETTY

Don't be nervous.

EVELYN

There shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The

Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're

sent to paradise.  How about you?  Have

you heard anything?

BILLY

You're a very special woman, and...well

baby, they're training me for war, and we

don't know what happens tomorrow.  So we

gotta make tonight special.

BARBARA

I hope you can back that up, flyboy.

Cause you're not ever gonna forget

tonight.

EVELYN

Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't

good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard

to say.

RAFE

The only reason it's hard to say is that

I keep thinking I don't have the right to

say it.  But I've got to because it's

true.  I love you.

(beat)

That must surprise you.

EVELYN

It surprises me that I'm not the only one

on this balcony who feels that way.

RAFE

There's one thing I have to say.  I'm

going away.

EVELYN

We're all going away.

RAFE

I'm going to the war.  The real war.

Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are

hanging on by their fingernails, and If

they lose, there'll be more people killed

than anybody can imagine.  And not just

there, but here.

EVELYN

But you're in the U.S. Army, how could

you --

RAFE

Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and

put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need

pilots, and we need experience.  I leave

tomorrow.

EVELYN

You waited til tonight to tell me?

RAFE

I had to tell you in person.  Because

there's something else I need to say.

RAFE

Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make

tonight memorable.  What I feel about you

makes it impossible for me to say

something like that.  If I don't come

back, I don't want to saddle you with

regret and sadness you'll carry the rest

of your life.

EVELYN

I don't know if you can choose that,

Rafe.

RAFE

Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I

love you.  And I will come back.  I'll

find a way.  And then we'll get a chance

to know if what I felt the first moment I

saw you, and every minute since then, is

real.

EVELYN

Do one thing for me, before you go.

CONDUCTOR'S VOICE

All aboard!

DANNY

Didn't you say you told her not to come?

RAFE

Yeah.

DANNY

Then why are you looking for her?

RAFE

It's a test.  If I asked her to come and

she came, it wouldn't tell me anything.

If I tell her not to come, and she

comes...then I know she loves me.

VOICE

ALL ABOARD!

DANNY

You're still a kid, ya know that?  Take

care of yourself.

RAFE

You too.

DANNY

Give 'em hell, Rafe.

RAFE

Rafe McCawley, Sir.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?

RAFE

That's me, Sir.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll

get you situated in some quarters, and

then introduce you to the equipment

you'll be flying.

RAFE

If you're patching up bullet holes right

here on the runway, maybe we should skip

the housekeeping and get right to the

planes.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are

to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

RAFE

Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to

matter.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

Good lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed

and shut down his engine.  Welcome to the

war.

GUARD

I've died and gone to heaven.

BARBARA

You know the ratio of men to women on

this island?  Four-thousand...to one.

BARBARA

See ya on the beach, boys!

CUT TO:

BRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)

I need help!  Someone get them off me!

OTHER BRITISH PILOT

(into radio)

Nigel's out!  I'll call in the position!

(to himself)

That Yank is bloody good.

RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)

Dear Evelyn... It is cold here.  So cold,

in a way that goes deep into your bones.

RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)

It's not easy making friends.  Two nights

ago I drank a beer with a couple of the

R.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing

here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both

of them got killed...

DISSOLVE TO:

RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)

There is one place I can go to find

warmth, and that is to think of you.

NAVY GUY 1

A woman beautiful as you shouldn't be

sitting alone.  Buy you a drink?

EVELYN

Thank you...Ensign.

NAVY GUY 1

Ensign!  Smart too!

NAVY GUY 2

So how about that drink?  Or dinner?

EVELYN

Thank you, but...I really want to be

alone right now.

NAVY GUY 3

Want to see something long and hard?

EVELYN

I'm sorry.  I've got a letter to write.

NAVY GUY 3

Cold bitch.

EVELYN

What did you say?

NAVY GUY 3

I said you're cold.

EVELYN

Cold?  No, I'm just thinking about a war.

And maybe you should be too.

EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)

Dear Rafe... It's strange to be so far

from you in body, and so close to you in

spirit.  But if our spirits really give

our bodies life, then you should know

this:  Every night I look at the sunset,

and try to draw the last ounce of heat

from its long day...

EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)

...and send it from my heart to yours.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel.  He'll be

back with us tomorrow.

BRITISH AIR COMMANDER

Some of us look down on the Yanks for not

yet joining this war.  I'd just like to

say that if there are many more back home

like you, God help anyone who goes to war

with America.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

Please be seated, gentlemen.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

Churchill and Stalin are asking me what

I'm asking you:  How long is America

going to pretend the world is not at war?

GENERAL MARSHALL

We've increased supply shipments to them,

Mr. President, and we're losing merchant

vessels every day.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

Shift in every destroyer and anti-

aircraft weapon you can find.

ADMIRAL

Sir, our Pacific Fleet is already down

to almost nothing.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

Gentlemen, at this moment the nation of

Hungry has a larger military then the

United States.  We have no choice but to

draw from whatever we can.

NISHIKURA

So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us

thought your education at an American

university would make you too weak to

fight the Americans.

YAMAMOTO

If knowledge of opponents and careful

calculation of danger is taken as

weakness then I have misunderstood what

it means to be Japanese.

NISHIKURA

The time has come to strike!  Or to sit

and let the Americans cut off our oil and

our future.  I know what you whisper to

the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans

are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

OYAMA

Franklin Roosevelt.  Born into great

wealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was

stricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,

or even stand without help.

Photographers will not take pictures of

him in his chair; Americans do not wish

to know how weak their President is.

NISHIKURA

You have something to say, Yamamoto?

YAMAMOTO

The Council knows I have opposed fighting

the Americans.  No matter how great our

resolve, they have resources beyond ours.

If we must go to war, there is only one

way -- deal them a blow from which it will

take them years to recover.  In that time

we can conquer all of the Pacific, and

they will have no choice but to ask for

peace.

NISHIKURA

You see us as capable of such a blow?

YAMAMOTO

The Americans themselves have made it

possible.  We will annihilate them in a

single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

RED

If I ain't n-never on a b-boat again,

it'll be too s-soon.

BILLY

Where are the women on this --

RED

They're s-still asleep!

DANNY

Drop your cocks and grab your socks,

boys!  The terror of the skies are here!

ANTHONY

They're all drunk.

DANNY

Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.

COMA

Where's that lizard?

DANNY

What lizard?

COMA

The one that slept in my mouth last

night.

DANNY

What the hell happened to you guys?

COMA

Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a

big...pot.  Like...like...

RED

A m-missionary?

COMA

No, like...

DANNY

This is an Air Base?  Where's your squad

commander?

RED

I th-think I'm gonna like it here.

COMA

You guys are new?

DANNY

Yeah.

COMA

Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about

mai-tai's.

DANNY

Hey!  What is this, the planes all

bunched up like that?

MECHANIC

The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This

makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier

to service.

DANNY

What about easier to hit in an air raid?

MECHANIC

Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four

thousand miles away.  So you guys just

arrived, huh?

DANNY

Yeah.

MECHANIC

We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!

DANNY

Well guys...I reckon there's just one

thing to do...

RED

More m-mai-tai's!

COMA

Absolutely right.

COMA

No, you guys aren't doing it right.  It's

in the hands.  They talk story.

COMA

Fish swim in ocean... Happy in the Mother

Sea... Girl, beautiful girl, with big

jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at

her thighs...

ANTHONY

I never knew those dances were so

sophisticated.

COMA

...Fish nibble at her breasts...

COMA

A more beautiful girl walks by...

BILLY

Hey, isn't that Evelyn?

DANNY

Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

COMA

You guys know her?!  I gotta have an

intro!  Man, I'd like to --

DANNY

A friend of mine's in love with her.  So

you don't even look -- not ever.

DANNY

I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a-

bitch on this island!  So I'm the one to

say this!  Here's to Rafe McCawley!  A

better pilot...and a better man...than

me.

OTHER PILOTS

To Rafe.

COMA

Uh oh.  Volcanic eruption!

COMA

Shit, he's puking on my feet!

RED

Well, you p-puked on his feet.

COMA

Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!

ADMIRAL KIMMEL

...transfer twelve more destroyers to

Atlantic Fleet, and all the available

anti-aircraft weaponry?!  Washington has

gone insane!

STRATEGIC ANALYST

We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and

war gamed the likely outcome of a

Japanese attack against each of our major

bases in the Pacific.  Wake, Guam,

Midway, the Philippines.  In each case,

we lose.

ADMIRAL KIMMEL

You left out Hawaii.

STRATEGIC ANALYST

Pearl Harbor can't be attacked

effectively from the air.  It's too

shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.

Pearl Harbor's safe.  It's everywhere

else that we're vulnerable.

ADMIRAL KIMMEL

Step up surveillance of Japanese

communications.  They're gonna do

something somewhere.  I can feel it.

GENDA

Look at the ships -- all grouped.  Perfect

targets!

JAPANESE OFFICER

And the planes!  They are -- what is that

American expression?  Sitting geese?

YAMAMOTO

Sitting ducks.

JAPANESE OFFICER

How can they be so foolish?

YAMAMOTO

They think no one would be stupid enough

to attack them at Pearl Harbor.

GENDA

Or perhaps they think no one is capable.

Look at this...

GENDA

Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet

makes them feel safe.  A torpedo dropped

from an airplane plunges to one hundred

feet before it can level off.  That is a

conventional torpedo.  But we have been

experimenting.

GENDA

Wooden fins.  We are testing them

tomorrow.

GENDA

We have chosen this place because its

depth is exactly the same as Pearl

Harbor's.

YAMAMOTO

Uncharged torpedoes have different

balance.

GENDA

I have arranged a live fire drill -- with

your permission.

GENDA

Of course against a ship the explosion

will not be dissipated, and will have

more force.

BILLY

Are you sure they're here?

ANTHONY

If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!

ANTHONY

Looking good, Red.

RED

Shut up.

ANTHONY

What is it with Red?  I've never seen him

this way.

BILLY

He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny,

you coming?

DANNY

Nah, I'm gonna stay here.  Read.

BARBARA

Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I

mean, you can put your hands on him if

you want to, but then my hands will break

yours.

BETTY

He was that good?

BARBARA

No, I was.

BILLY

Red, Peeping Tom stuff can get us court-

marshaled.

RED

Shhh!

RED

(singing)

Oh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one

for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't

you see...

RED

(singing)

I'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty,

Betty, Betty, Betty!

ANTHONY

(singing)

Oh Sandra...I like you...love you...

IAN

Leapin' Jesus!

RAFE

(climbing down)

The struts are loose, the hydraulics are

leaking, and the electrical system's

shorting out in the cockpit.

IAN

Well which of those three ya want fixed?

RAFE

All of 'em.

IAN

If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya

should'a stayed in the bloody States!

RAFE

And if you don't give me a plane that can

handle combat, you better start learning

to speak German.

IAN

Fook ya!

RAFE

Learn English, then!

IAN

Fook ya dooble!

BRITISH PILOT

Bloody Krauts!  Night raid!

IAN

I have'na been able ta --

RAFE

Crank her!

IAN

God speed ya, laddie.

RAFE

Here they come.

BRITISH SQUAD LEADER

Alpha group, on the bombers!  Beta group,

take the fighters!

RAFE

We've got him hurt, stay on him!

RAFE

We've got him going!

SQUAD LEADER

McCawley!  Get to the clouds!  Get into

the clouds!

RAFE

I can't see the clouds!

SQUAD LEADER

Get out of there, McCawley!  Get out of

there!

SQUAD LEADER

McCawley down.  No 'chute.

WHITE BOXER

You hit hard -- for a cook.

BARBARA

Let's get into civvies and find a bar.

MARTHA

Right after church?

BARBARA

You've gotta sin some, to get

forgiveness.  Come with us, Evelyn.  You

need some sin.

EVELYN

I've got to write some requisitions.

We're undersupplied with morphine.

BETTY

Morphine?  We've been here a month and

nobody's had worse than a sunburn.

BETTY

I wish she could forget him.

BARBARA

You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

EVELYN

Can I help you, sailor?

DORIE

'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors

is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to

look at this.

EVELYN

Our doctor's gone too.

DORIE

Sorry to trouble you.

EVELYN

Wait, let me look at that... You better

come in here.

EVELYN

How'd you get this?

DORIE

Boxin'.

EVELYN

Win?

DORIE

Yes'm.

EVELYN

What's your name?

DORIE

Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

EVELYN

I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But

I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs

sewing, or else it's gonna make a big

lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?

EVELYN

How often you fight like this?

DORIE

Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight

champion of the West Virginia.

EVELYN

What do you get for winning?

DORIE

Respect.

DORIE

No doctor would'a give me that good.

DORIE

Thank you, 'Mam.

EVELYN

Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big

as you -- and smart too, you knew where

to come when your ship couldn't help --

do you still have to fight with your

fists to get respect?

DORIE

I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be

a man.  They made me a cook -- and not

even that, really -- I clean up after the

other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's

shoes.  In two years, they've never even

let me fire a gun.

EVELYN

You take care, Dorie.

DORIE

You too, 'Mam.

EVELYN

...Rafe...

DANNY

Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe

McCawley's best friend.

EVELYN

Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were.

Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's

why you've come.

DANNY

Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the

one to tell you, if it happened.

EVELYN

He told me about you.  That he had no

other friend like you.

DANNY

Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business,

owned their own planes.  Real straight,

frugal.  My father was the town drunk.

Went to sleep one night on the railroad

tracks and was still there when the Dawn

Express came along.  Rafe and I were the

only ones at the funeral.  He took me

back to his house, and I never left.

EVELYN

You were more like brothers.

DANNY

I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me

how to fly.

EVELYN

He said you're the only one he ever saw

who was better in the air than him.

DANNY

...He said that?

DANNY

Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with

the news, and it took me a couple of days

to work up the guts to come here and tell

you.  I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as

noble.  But if there's anything I can

ever do to help -- you let me know, okay?

DANNY

I understand why Rafe loved you.  You're

as strong as he was.

YAMAMOTO

Everything real except the fact that no

one is shooting back at us.

GENDA

If we achieve surprise, they will offer

little resistance.

YAMAMOTO

Set up teams of radio operators to send

out messages the Americans will

intercept, concerning every potential

American target in the Pacific.  Include

Hawaii -- the clutter will be more

confusing that way.

GENDA

Brilliant, Admiral.

YAMAMOTO

A brilliant man would find a way not to

fight a war.

AIDE

Mr. President, we've received a message

from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan.

His sources tell him the Japanese are

assembling their fleet to attack us.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

We're picking up warnings for every

American base in the Pacific.  Does this

ambassador know the target?

AIDE

Not for sure.  But he thinks it's Pearl

Harbor.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

Tell the Pentagon.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

No, George, I need the practice, in case

there's a fire.

ADMIRAL

The attack seems inevitable.  The

question is where?  The way to answer

that question is to ask:  if we were the

Japanese, how would we do it?

VICE ADMIRAL

Between America and the Far East are the

sea lanes where the winds and the

currents make the best route for

shipping.  Far above is the northern

route, between Canada and Russia.

Between these two is something they call

the Vacant Sea.  If I were the Japs, I'd

send a task force there.  You could hide

the entire land mass of Asia in the

Vacant Sea, and nobody would know.

ADMIRAL

So they pop out and attack where?

VICE ADMIRAL

That's the problem, Admiral.  They could

hit anywhere they want.

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 1

Where's the Lexington going?

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 2

Out on maneuvers, like the Enterprise.

DENTAL ASSISTANT

Dr. Takanawa, you have a call from Tokyo.

DENTIST

Please excuse me.  Just relax.

DENTIST

Takanawa... Yes?...

DENTIST

Yes, they are all...no wait, I see the

big one moving.  The one that's flat on

top, what do they call it?...

LISTENER

Here's something, over the line from

Tokyo.

TRACER

It's connected to a local dentist.  His

office is beside Pearl Harbor.

INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR

This dentist, is he a spy?

LISTENER

Sounds too innocent.  His accent is from

the old country.  Somebody official-

sounding calls, he thinks it's

discourteous not to respond.

AIDE

Sir, we just had an intelligence

intercept.  Someone from Tokyo called a

local dentist whose office looks over

Pearl.  They wanted to know the exact

location of the ships.

ADMIRAL KIMMEL

Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the

ships are sitting... What are we supposed

to do about that?

AIDE

I...don't know, Sir.  But it just seemed

significant.

ADMIRAL KIMMEL

Have intelligence keep monitoring him.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Closer, ladies!  Closer!  Now smile!...

Great!  Next week I'll show you a print

and you can order your Pictures of

Paradise!

BETTY

Barbara, here's yours...and Evelyn, here

you are.

BETTY

It's been a month and you haven't smiled.

We just want you to know we love you.

BARBARA

What is it with nurses and pilots?

COLONEL

You're Walker, right?

DANNY

Yes Sir.

COLONEL

That was a nice little stunt you pulled,

buzzing the base.

DANNY

You liked that?

COLONEL

Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting

you out of the squadron.

DANNY

Sir?

COLONEL

I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you

and your buddies are gonna transfer your

planes up to Haleiwa.

DANNY

Hale-what?

COLONEL

You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just

lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

DANNY

Sir, I --

COLONEL

Too late for apologies, Walker.

DANNY

I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was

just gonna say it was worth it to feel

like a real pilot again, even if it was

only for five seconds.

DANNY

How's everything?

EVELYN

We got some soldiers in traction from a

jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except

for the occasional fighter plane buzzing

us.

DANNY

That might not have been such a good

idea.  They're making us fly out of a

half-paved airfield.  The real punishment

is that I won't be back to the barracks

till it's too late for dinner or coffee.

So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

EVELYN

I was just thinking that war is a series

of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why

we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to

Rafe?

DANNY

I swore not to talk about him tonight,

but there's all this stuff I think I

ought to tell you, that he didn't get a

chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He

had such high expectations of himself

that he always felt empty.  The week he

met you he told me he felt his heart had

always lived in winter, and for the first

time in his life he has seen the spring.

DANNY

Sorry.

EVELYN

He told me he didn't want to leave me

with regret.  Now that's all I have.

DANNY

Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

EVELYN

Well...sure.

DANNY

From the air?

EVELYN

So beautiful!

DANNY

Hang on.

EVELYN

I didn't realize until tonight that I've

stopped wanting to live.

EVELYN'S VOICE

Dearest Rafe --

EVELYN'S VOICE

...Every sunset...

EVELYN'S VOICE

...gather it's heat into my heart, and

send it to you...

MESSAGE BOY

Daniel Walker?...

DANNY

Rafe!

RAFE

Evelyn.

RAFE

I sent telegrams, I guess the military

traffic held them up.

EVELYN

Why were you sitting here, instead of...

RAFE

I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just

stood there wondering if you knew.  You

looked...sad, and I had to sit down a

minute.

EVELYN

How did you?...

RAFE

...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog,

and nobody could see me.  I hit the water

hard.  And it was so...cold.

RAFE

I don't know how long I was in the water.

A Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They

were headed to Spain.  They docked in La

Rota, right beside a German ship, and

told me to stay hidden below.  I was

afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some

clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,

where the priest contacted the

resistance, and got me on a freighter to

New York.

RAFE

I called my folks, then Colonel

Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to

pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me.

I told the Colonel I needed to see

somebody first, and he had a supply

flight heading out in an hour.

(beat)

I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't

said anything.

EVELYN

I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know

that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't

you?

RAFE

Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.

EVELYN

It's been...so different, being so sure

you were dead.

RAFE

I'm so sorry for what you must've gone

through, but I'm back.

RAFE

Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has

something changed?

(beat)

I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid

not to.

(beat)

Have you fallen in love?

RAFE

It's all right.  Danny always said I see

things with my emotions instead of my

eyes.

EVELYN

It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I

wrote you, they --

RAFE

Don't worry about that.  Guys away from

home, lonely, good-hearted women try to

cheer them up.

EVELYN

It's not that I didn't mean everything I

wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you

were dead.  And now --

DANNY

You're alive!

RAFE

Aw, God.  Oh my God.

EVELYN

Rafe --

RAFE

Evelyn...

DANNY

Don't worry.  I'll find him.

BETTY

This came while you were gone.

DANNY

You'd always go sit in a plane whenever

you were upset.

RAFE

Upset?  Why should I be upset?

DANNY

Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're

scared to talk about it.

DANNY

Drink up.  Then we'll talk.

ANTHONY

Rafe?!

RAFE

They'll go under you because their planes

are faster, then they run so you can't

catch 'em.  But then they'll come around

and take you from behind -- like some

Americans will.

RAFE

Sorry.

DANNY

Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's

better to come out with it.

RAFE

I didn't mean it.

DANNY

Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you

think.

RAFE

Waitress!  Four beers!

DANNY

You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

RAFE

If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

RAFE

We gotta face some facts here.

DANNY

What facts are those?

RAFE

I understand how it could happen.  I know

why any guy would love her.  And I can't

blame you that it happened.  You thought

I was dead, she was grieving, you were

trying to help her.

DANNY

I was grieving too.

RAFE

Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.

DANNY

So what are you saying?

RAFE

I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time

for you to fuck off.

DANNY

You left her.  How's that for a fact?

RAFE

How's this for a fact?  I loved her

first.

DANNY

You know, you're a lousy drinker.

Drinking's supposed to make men feel

bigger.  It only makes you stupid.  And

weak.

RAFE

How's this?

DANNY

You want it, you got it.

ANTHONY

Let 'em fight, they need it.

SAILOR

Is this a private fight or can anybody

jump in?

RAFE

That hurt?  I didn't think you had any

balls.

YAMAMOTO

The submarines will be reaching the

harbor soon.  I hope they don't set off

the alarm too soon.

WATCH OFFICER

Captain, lookouts report a sighting, two

points off the starboard beam.

SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN

How big?

SONAR OPERATOR

...I've lost it.

SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN

Probably a blackfish.  I've seen them

look like subs.

DUTY OFFICER

Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then

lost it.  Now our sonar reports the

contact.

CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT

Radio room!  Raise the Selfridge.  Tell

the Squadron Commander we have spotted a

sub and request permission to depth

charge.

CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT

We're five miles from Pearl Harbor and

it's moving in from the open sea.

Prepare to move to attack speed.

INTERCOM

Sir, the Squadron Commander on Selfridge

denies permission.

CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT

What?

INTERCOM

Denies, Sir.  He says it's a blackfish.

CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT

If it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat

up it's ass!

RAFE

How come you're not pukin'?

DANNY

I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like

throwing up every minute since you got

back.

DANNY

Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like

you're thinking.

RAFE

(between heaves)

Fuck you.

DANNY

She loves you.  I know that.  And part of

what she loves in me is how much of you

she sees in me.

DANNY

We were both torn up.  I started dropping

by to see her, because we understood what

each other felt.  We'd have coffee and

try not to talk about you, but we always

would.

DANNY

She said I was so much like you.  I said,

No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of

you, but I'm not you, not as good as you.

Everybody else saw me as a loser with a

big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw

the better part of me, the part of me

that could be like you, and changed me.

You made me who I am.

RAFE

How sweet.  Is that when you put the move

on her?

RAFE

That's better.

SUB COMMANDER

Prepare to launch midget sub.

SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)

My revered father, I go now to fulfill my

mission and my destiny.

SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)

I hope it is a destiny that will bring

honor to our family, and if it requires

my life I will sacrifice it gladly, if

you can think of me and my hope to be a

good servant of our nation, and a worthy

son.  With love and devotion, Kazuyoshi.

LOOKOUT

Captain, do you see that, in our wake?

CAPTAIN OF THE WARD

That's a conning tower.

OFFICER

Could it be one of ours?

CAPTAIN OF THE WARD

He's trying to follow us through the sub

nets, into the harbor.  Sink the son of a

bitch.

JAPANESE SUB CAPTAIN

Dive!  Dive!

CAPTAIN OF THE WARD

Fleet command, from destroyer Ward.  Have

fired upon and sunk enemy submarine

seeking to enter Pearl Harbor.

ELLIS

Time to shut her down.  That was a good

first session.  You'll get the hang of

this new radar soon.

PRIVATE

Thank you, Sir.  Hey...what's this?

ELLIS

I've never seen anything like that

before.

OFFICER

Watch command... Coming from which

direction?... Hold on.

OFFICER

Radar station has picked up a cloud of

blips, coming in from the northeast.

COMMANDER

KGMB is on early.  That means we've got a

flight of B-17's coming in from the

mainland, they use the radio music for a

homing beacon.

ELLIS

All right, Sir.

(he hangs up)

They say don't worry about it.

SCOUT PLANE PILOT

Harbor quiet.  Ships in place.  Carriers

gone.

YAMAMOTO

We have achieved surprise, but their

carriers are not in port.  I don't like

this.

GENDA

We have a fighter screen up, in case we

are attacked, Admiral.

YAMAMOTO

We must go ahead.  This is our moment.

LIEUTENANT

Admiral, one of our destroyers reports

sinking a sub on its way into Pearl.

ANTHONY

They got Billy.

DANNY

Come with us!

RAFE

Where are we going?

DANNY

Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles

north of here.

RAFE

What's there?

DANNY

Six P-40's.

SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT

Don't panic!  Don't panic!

PANICKED SAILOR

The water's rising!  It's coming up,

we're all gonna drown!

SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT

The air pressure will equalize it!

DANNY

They ready, Earl?

EARL

They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

DANNY

Cover!

EARL

You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a

DANNY

This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's

World War Two!

RAFE

They're coming around for another pass.

You got extra weapons and ammo?

EARL

Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun

lockers!

DANNY

You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come

with me!

RAFE

Danny, over there!  We're in a canyon,

they'll come straight down it, we'll get

'em in a crossfire.

RED

D-don't like it when we fight back, do

ya!

DANNY

Earl!  You said the planes were ready

but -- but what?

EARL

Of the four left, only one is full of

fuel.

RAFE

Will the others get into the air?

EARL

Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

DANNY

Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma,

you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come

with us!  Earl, you get on the radio!

We're gonna fight these fuckers.

JOE

How do we do it?

DANNY

Your call, Rafe.

RAFE

Get rolling as fast as you can.  Stay

low!  We'll use the topography to

separate them and then we can take 'em

one on one.

DANNY

It's tight.

RAFE

Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season.

Don't hit the barn.

EARL

I see six...seven...eight of the

They're all over us!

Oh shit, oh shit...

You hear my okay?

DANNY

Yeah.  So you can call me if you need

RAFE

I got a half a tank.  You?

DANNY

Little less.

They're in strafing formation, we'll blow

DANNY

Home of the brave.

They're trying to hold formation.  We can

chew 'em up!

JAPANESE SQUADRON COMMANDER

Second attack wave is in the air.

DISC JOCKEY

All Army, Navy, and Marine personnel to

Pearl Harbor.

HOPKINS

Oval Room... Yes, he is.

(to Roosevelt)

It's Knox, Mr. President.

ROOSEVELT

(taking phone)

Yes?

ROOSEVELT

The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

HOPKINS

My God.  Do we have damage estimates?

ROOSEVELT

Our Pacific Fleet, at anchor, unprepared?

It's terrible.  It has to be.  And it's

not over.

DANNY

We need ammo too!

EARL

Strip it from the wrecks!

EARL

Who the fuck taught you to fly?

DANNY

He did.

SHIMAZAKI

Second wave, deploy over the military

bases.  High level bombers to the air

stations, dive bombers attack ships in

harbor.  Fighters strafe and cover.

OFFICER

Grab a dinghy and get ammo from the base

ammo storeroom.

GUNNERY SERGEANT

We need weapons and ammo!

SUPPLY SERGEANT

You need authorization.

GUNNERY SERGEANT

The fuck I do!

SANDRA

I can't tell who's gotten morphine and

who hasn't!

EVELYN

Take a grease pencil and mark an M on the

forehead of everyone you stick.

EVELYN

Don't look for a vein, just poke.

SANDRA

My pen's dry!

EVELYN

Use lipstick.  Use ammo belts for

tourniquets, use your own nylons if you

have to!  Barbara!  Grab anything that

will hold a pint of blood and sterilize

it.

SENIOR DOCTOR

Evelyn!  You have to do the triage!

They're bringing them in with trucks!

EVELYN

morphine, he can't wait...

EVELYN

Take him outside and cover him; he's

dead.

EVELYN

She's gone too, take her --

CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA

We can save her if we make the open sea!

CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA

We're not gonna make it -- and if we go

down here we block the channel... Beach

her, there!

EVELYN

Go to the base hardware store and get

some of those canister spray things they

use for killing bugs.

ORDERLY

Insecticide?...

EVELYN

No, just the sprayers.  We'll fill them

with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them

and cool the burns!  GO!

EVELYN

We're gonna need every bed.  If they can

breathe, make 'em get up and move

someplace else!

GENDA

We have achieved complete surprise!  The

first wave is returning, the second is

attacking now, and we have lost only a

few planes.  We can launch a third wave,

Admiral.

YAMAMOTO

The second wave has not returned.  And we

have no idea where their carriers are.

What is the damage report?

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

We have Commander Fuchida on the radio

now, Admiral.

FUCHIDA'S VOICE

I am over the harbor now...

FUCHIDA

(into radio)

We have a tremendous victory.  Many ships

damaged, some totally destroyed.  But the

Second Wave's attack is being hindered by

the smoke.

YAMAMOTO

The more we attack, the harder it is to

find targets.  And we no longer have

surprise.

GENDA

If we launch the third wave and

annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy

their ability to operate in the Pacific

for at least a year!

YAMAMOTO

And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we

destroy our ability to fight them at all.

(beat)

As soon as the second wave returns, we

will withdraw.

CONSCIOUS SOLDIER

Sarge?!  Where are you, Sarge?

MEDIC

We've got two more over here!

SHORT

I want lookouts and sentries everywhere,

with orders to shoot first and ask

questions later.

COLONEL

You think an invasion possible, General?

SHORT

After this morning, we better not

consider anything impossible.

SHORT

From Washington.  "Intelligence reports

an ultimatum from Japan to be given

precisely at one p.m.  Washington time.

Just what significance the hour set may

have we do not know, but be on alert

accordingly."

SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD SAILOR

Sir, I...I lost the dinghy.

CAPTAIN

Well, son, we won't worry about the

dinghy today.

RAFE

How can we help?

RAFE

What else can we do?

EVELYN

There's nothing you can do here, they'll

die or they won't, we just --

EVELYN

There was a sailor, a black man on the

West Virginia, named Dorie Miller.  I'd

like to know if he's alive.

DANNY

Where is the West Virginia?

OFFICER

There.

DANNY

We're looking for Dorie Miller.

DORIE

That's me, Sir.

RAFE

A friend of ours wanted to be sure you're

alive.  Evelyn.  A nurse.

DORIE

How is she?

DANNY

Like we all are.

DORIE

There's something out there I need to

get.  Will you help me?

DORIE

The Arizona.  Hold the dinghy steady, so

it doesn't bust open.

SAILOR

What's that?

SAILOR FLASHLIGHT

Just hand on.  They'll find us.

SAILOR

How do you know?

SAILOR FLASHLIGHT

Because we would find them.

SAILOR FLASHLIGHT

Breathe easy.  Stay calm.

SAILOR

You hear something?

SAILOR

It's letting out air, and letting in

water!

ROOSEVELT

Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date

which will live in infamy -- the United

States of American was suddenly and

deliberately attacked by naval and air

forces of the Empire of Japan.

ROOSEVELT

The distance of Hawaii from Japan makes

it obvious that the attacks was planned

many days or even weeks ago.  During the

intervening time the Japanese Government

has deliberately sought to deceive the

United States by false statements and

expressions of hope for continued peace.

ROOSEVELT

...I regret to tell you that many

American lives have been lost.

ROOSEVELT

Yesterday the Japanese Government also

launched an attack against Malaya.  Last

night Japanese forces attacked Hong

Kong... Guam...

ROOSEVELT

...the Philippine Islands... Wake

Island... And this morning the Japanese

attacked Midway Island.

ROOSEVELT

The facts speak for themselves.  With

confidence in our armed forces -- with

the unbounding determination of our

people -- we will gain the inevitable

triumph -- so help us God.  I ask that

the Congress declare that since the

unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan

on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of

war --

ROOSEVELT'S VOICE

War...war...war...

ROOSEVELT

Gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the

fact that our enemies believe they can

defeat us -- it's the fact that our people

believe it too.  I want a plan -- a

workable plan -- to hit the heart of

Japan, to bomb them the way they have

bombed us.

ADMIRAL

Mr. President, Pearl Harbor caught us

because we didn't face facts.  This isn't

a time for ignoring them again.  There

are no planes in the entire American

arsenal capable of covering the distance

to Japan from any land base we control

while carrying enough bombs to do any

damage whatsoever.

GENERAL MARSHALL

He's right, Mr. President.  The Army has

long range bombers, but no place to

launch them from.  Midway's too far,

China is overrun by Japanese forces, and

Russia refuses to go to war with Japan

and won't allow us to launch a raid from

there.

ADMIRAL

The navy's planes are small, carry light

loads, and have short range.  We would

have to get them within a few hundred

miles of Japan, and therefore risk our

carriers.  And if we lose our carriers,

we have no shield against invasion.

ROOSEVELT

What if the Japanese did invade?

GENERAL MARSHALL

We've done studies.  We're confident we

would turn them back eventually...after

they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

ADMIRAL

Mr. President...with all respect...what

you are asking can't be done.

ROOSEVELT

Do not tell me...it can't be done.

MINISTER

...Where is God in this?  Our enemies

believe a divine wind protects them.  We

see our friends laid out before us, and

find it hard to believe in anything at

all.

MINISTER

Though we cannot understand why our

friends should die while we live, we can

affirm our truest selves in our belief

that any God worth divinity would choose

both justice and mercy, and would take

these fallen brothers and sisters into

eternal peace.  Amen.

EVELYN

Rafe --

RAFE

I need to tell you something.  I didn't

know what it was to lose somebody, to see

death and find how much it scares you.

That you haven't lived and loved enough.

I didn't understand.  Forgive me.

EVELYN

Rafe... No.  You forgive me.

RAFE

Of course I forgive you.  I know what you

feel for Danny is real.  And your choice

is your choice.

EVELYN

That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It

wasn't a choice.  It --

MAJOR

Lieutenant Rafe McCawley?

RAFE

Yes, Major.

MAJOR

Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too?

DANNY

I'm Walker.

MAJOR

You're going Stateside.  We fly out in

half an hour.

RAFE

What for, Sir?

MAJOR

Ask Colonel Doolittle.  Those orders are

from him.

DANNY

I told her not to come.

DANNY

This hasn't been easy for any of us.  I

feel awful for how it's happened.  But

I've seen my first spring too.  Thanks

for knowing that's true.

DOOLITTLE

I heard what you did.

RAFE

We can explain, Colonel.

DOOLITTLE

Explain what?

DANNY

Whatever is was you heard about us.

DOOLITTLE

You mean the hula shirts you were flying

in?... Or the six planes you shot down?

You're both being awarded the Silver

Star, and promoted to captain.

RAFE

Is that the good new, Sir, or --

DOOLITTLE

You're just about the only pilots in the

Army with actual combat experience, so

you're volunteering for a mission I've

been ordered to put together.  Do you

know what top secret is?

RAFE

Well sure, Colonel --

DOOLITTLE

Top secret means you help me pick the

other pilots, train, and go -- without

knowing where you're going until it's too

late.

DANNY

You can count on us.

DOOLITTLE

There's only one other thing I can tell

you.

DOOLITTLE

You won't need any goddamn hula shirts.

VOICE

Attention!

DOOLITTLE

Be seated.  The mission you've

volunteered for is dangerous.  How

dangerous?  Look at the man beside you.

It's a good bet that six weeks from now,

either you or he will be dead.

DANNY

Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna

make it.

RAFE

What color flowers you want me to bring

to your funeral?

DOOLITTLE

In flight school you qualified in single

and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be

flying multi-engines here.

RAFE

(whispering)

Bombers.

DOOLITTLE

I want to introduce a couple of people.

Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has

volunteered for gunnery training so that

he can go on the mission, because we

can't spare the weight of an extra man.

DANNY

(whispering)

A long range bomber mission.

DOOLITTLE

...And Ross Greening, who will oversee

your equipment.  Any questions?

DANNY

Who'll be the first one in, Colonel?  I'd

like to volunt --

DOOLITTLE

I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not

just putting this mission together -- I'm

leading it myself.

RAFE

I take it back, about the flowers.  We're

all gonna die.

DOOLITTLE

This is what we'll fly -- the B-25.

There's one thing you have to be aware of

from the very beginning.  You see that

private?

DOOLITTLE

Green means go.  Red means dead.

DOOLITTLE

You're having trouble getting airborne in

the shorter space because you're not

revving the engines enough.  You've got

to push them to the limit before you ever

start to move.

DOOLITTLE

We've got to get the weight down.

GREENING

Okay, forty pounds gone.  And in it's

place, this.

GREENING

Weight, 3 ounces.  Cost, 20 cents.

DOOLITTLE

Does it work?

DOOLITTLE

Right down to the treetops.  Low as you

can.

DANNY

Fun today.  Like old times.

RAFE

Danny, what the hell are you trying to do

out there?

DANNY

What do you mean?  I'm just doing what

we've always done.

RAFE

No.  You're trying to beat me.

DANNY

We've always tried to beat each other.

RAFE

Bullshit.  We've played with each other,

pushed each other.  This is different.

Like you want to prove that you're

better than me.  Who's that for --

Evelyn?

DANNY

Maybe just trying to measure up.

RAFE

What's between you and her is between you

and her.  But here's what's between you

and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny.

And you're mine.

RAFE

When we were growing up, I had

everything.  You had nothing.  You

climbed out of a hole I couldn't even see

the bottom of.  I think maybe when I went

off to England, I was trying to measure

up to you.  Measuring up's over.  Let's

just look out for each other.  Okay?

ROOSEVELT'S VOICE

Good evening, America...

ROOSEVELT'S VOICE

I'm told that 80% of American families

are listening to these fireside chats of

ours, and I'm happy we can come together,

as one great American family.  I'd like

each of you within the sound of my voice

to find a map...

ROOSEVELT'S VOICE

Look at the Pacific Ocean.  It covers

half the surface of the earth.  And look

at the great Atlantic.  The oceans both

divide and connect us to our enemies, and

either they will come to us, or we will

go to them...

RED

N-naval station?  What's g-going on?

RAFE

Wish I knew, Red.

DOOLITTLE

Want to see where they're going?

ANTHONY

I guess that settles it.  Somewhere in

the Pacific.

RED

With a s-short r-runway.

DOOLITTLE

You have rooms at the Biltmore.  I

suggest a nice meal and a good night's

sleep.  We leave tomorrow.

ANTHONY

San Francisco, here we are!

DANNY

(grinning)

I don't reckon we can get hogbrains and

grits, but I hear a man can eat good in

this town.

RAFE

I'm gonna turn in.  I hate being on the

water.  I think this is the last sleep

I'll get for awhile.

RAFE

McCawley.

MANAGER

Have fun.

RAFE

What?...

EVELYN

They were bringing back a ship full of

wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I

wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I

needed to see you before you go.

RAFE

It must of been a convincing letter.

EVELYN

It was.  I couldn't have you go away,

wherever it is...to war...without knowing

something.  You think I made a choice, of

Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have

a choice.  I'm pregnant.

RAFE

Does Danny know?

EVELYN

I wasn't sure, until the day you turned

up alive.  I never had a chance to tell

him.  Now I can't have him thinking about

this when he needs to be thinking about

his mission, and how to come back from

it.

EVELYN

I want you thinking about that too.  Just

come back.

(beat)

Rafe, I see it in your face.  You're

thinking you don't have anything to live

for.  Don't you dare think that way.

I'll never write a letter, or look at a

sunset, without thinking of you.  I'll

love you my whole life.  And I want you

to live.

SHIP'S INTERCOM

Army pilots to the briefing room.

DOOLITTLE

Gentlemen, I can now tell you that the

target of this mission is Tokyo.

RED

And where's the secret base, Sir?  The

one we t-takeoff from.

DOOLITTLE

The navy will get us to within 400 miles

of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off

the carriers from there.

ANTHONY

Sir, has this ever been done, launching

an army bomber off a navy carrier?

DOOLITTLE

No.  Any other questions?

RED

C-Colonel, we been p-practicing

takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land

on these carriers d-decks.

DOOLITTLE

We won't have the fuel to get back to the

carriers; they'll turn and run back to

Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

RED

Then wh-where do we land?

DOOLITTLE

I have a phrase I want you all to

memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It

means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

RED

A-a-asshole!... Maybe it's l-longer

going this way.

DANNY

It's shorter than our practice runway.

RAFE

They'll turn the ship into the wind

before we launch.  That'll help.

DANNY

We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of

bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got

another Chinese phrase for Doolittle.

"Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It

means "Who the fuck thought up this

shit?"

DOOLITTLE

He was a navy man.

RAFE

Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather.

SMASH TO:

DOOLITTLE

Since we'll be on our own once we're in

the air, I thought I had a good idea

letting each crew select it's own target.

DOOLITTLE

Now we have fifteen requests for the

Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo

baseball stadium.

RED

I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed

to p-play baseball.

DOOLITTLE

I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But

I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The

idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge.

We're here to prove to them that they're

neither invincible nor superior.  So

let's try this again.  Military targets

only.

RED

Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy.

To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And

to practice it, ya gotta play --

DOOLITTLE

No baseball diamonds, Red.

RED

Y-Yes Sir.

ADMIRAL

The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we

launch the bombers.  They wanted our

carriers at Pearl, and now we've come to

them.  If the Japanese get us, they'll be

having dinner in San Francisco next

month.

RAFE

It's not getting any longer.

DANNY

Longer?  It's getting shorter.

DOOLITTLE

We'll take off late this afternoon.  I'll

hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary

bombs.  You'll come after me at night,

guided by the fires.  Then it's on to

China, where you'll arrive at dawn,

guided to their airfields by the homing

beacons the Chinese are going to switch

on for us.  That's if everything is

perfect -- like every other military

mission I've ever been involved with.

DOOLITTLE

Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane --

then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you.

I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't

make it, you don't go.

RAFE

Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you

make it or not.

DOOLITTLE

I know.

OFFICER

Sir, lookouts on the cruisers report

patrol boats, ten miles away!

HALSEY

The Japs have set up a picket line!

Order the cruisers to open fire!  We've

got to sink them before they get a

message away.

RADIO OPERATOR

They've reported our position!  Tell the

Admiral.

DOOLITTLE

How far are we from Tokyo?

ADMIRAL

Seven hundred miles.

LOUDSPEAKER

Army pilots, man your planes!

DOOLITTLE

Load in every bit of extra gas you can

carry!  And strip everything you don't

need out of the planes.  I mean

EVERYTHING!

DANNY

Broomsticks instead of tail guns.

RAFE

We'll get separated over the target, but

you and I will rendezvous for the run to

China.  I'm on your wing.

DANNY

And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.

RAFE

Home of the Brave.

HALSEY

Of all the other things this mission is

doing that have never been done before...

I've never sent out planes that I wasn't

going to see safely home.  Let's get out

of here.

RAFE

What's our ETA for Tokyo?

NAVIGATOR

Almost exactly at 12 noon.

RED

High n-noon.  I k-kinda like that.

DANNY

We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind.  How

we doing with fuel?

GUNNER

How do you think?

her work.

his shirt.

DOOLITTLE'S NAVIGATOR

Time for the others to break off.

JAPANESE DEFENSE OFFICER

Coastal stations report a low flying

plane coming in off the sea.

SUPERVISOR

From the sea?... That couldn't be right,

it must be part of the air raid practice

this morning.

ANTI-AIRCRAFT OFFICER

Not bad.

TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)

It is another beautiful day in Tokyo, as

all of Japan basks in a new day of

victory.

COMA

Listen to this -- it's Tokyo Rose.

TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)

Our brave sailors and soldiers, inspired

by our divine Emperor, have pushed the

Americans from the Pacific.

TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)

But hiding at home will not save them.

Each time the Americans have tasted the

samurai spirit, they have learned the

bitter taste of defeat, while Japan is

embraced by the divine wind that has

protected our island for seven centuries.

ANTHONY

We'll give that bitch something to

announce.

JAPANESE MOTHER

Yes!  So beautiful!

RAFE

Open bomb bay doors.

GUNNER

Bomb bay doors open, sir.

RAFE

It's all yours.

TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)

We interrupt this broadcast... Tokyo is

being bombed!

EMPEROR'S ATTENDANT

Surely just a drill, Divine One.

NAVIGATOR

Last bomb away.

GUNNER

We got Zeros!  And they're pissed off!

RAFE

Can you get 'em off us?

RED

Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!

RAFE

Danny, get the hell out of here!

RAFE

Danny, run for the clouds!

RAFE

We burned a lot of fuel back there.

Flash them and ask about their supply.

ANTHONY

"How's your fuel?"

GENERAL MARSHALL

We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President.

Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own

broadcast to make the announcement.

ROOSEVELT

Have the planes made it to China?

GENERAL MARSHALL

There've been some complications, Sir.

The Chinese didn't receive our request

for homing beacons until is was too late

to get them set.  And the planes had to

take off so early they may lack fuel to

make the mainland anyway.

ROOSEVELT

So those brave men are flying blind and

running out of fuel.

GENERAL MARSHALL

The Chinese are sending out search

parties to try to find the crews before

the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes

make it.

ROOSEVELT

God help them.

DOOLITTLE

We'll fly till we run out of fuel, then

bail out.

DOOLITTLE

Chute!

DOOLITTLE

Nobody else is gonna make it either.  If

I live through this, they're gonna put me

in Leavenworth Prison.

COMA

We're running out of fuel.  And I can't

find the beacon.

RAFE

I don't know if we're over sea or land.

Drop flares and try to spot something.

DANNY

Flash Rafe.  We're gonna bail.

RED

They've gotta jump.

RAFE

Not unless we know he's over land!

RAFE

You are not bailing out into water!

RAFE'S NAVIGATOR

Coastline below!

RAFE

We've got coast!  Signal him to climb and

jump.

RED

They don't have fuel to make altitude.

He's gonna set it down in the water.

RED

Y-O-U... G-O.  You go on.

RAFE

N-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in

first.

RAFE

Hang on tight!  I'll put her in the

smooth water and we'll swim in!

RAFE

It won't open til the plane fills!

RAFE

Danny!  DANNY!

DANNY

I've made better landings.

RAFE

You hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're

gonna make it!

RAFE

Danny...

DANNY

I can't make it.

RAFE

Yes you can.

DANNY

Take care of Evelyn.

RAFE

I will.  And your baby.

(beat)

You're gonna be a father.

DANNY

No.  You are.

RAFE

Danny... Land of the free... Land of the

free...

VOICE OVER

The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment

of America's war with Japan.  Before it,

America knew nothing but defeat; after

it, nothing but victory.

(beat)

One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to

Vladivostok, Russia, where they were

interred for much of the war.  Thirteen

planes crash landed in China, where the

Chinese people helped the Americans

escape, and had their villages destroyed

and citizens executed by the Japanese

forces of occupation.  Two crews were

captured by the Japanese and three fliers

were executed without trial, called "war

criminals" by the Japanese.  Jimmy

Doolittle was promoted to General, and

given the medal of honor.

FADE OUT.

THE END
