HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU

GIGI (V.O.)

I have a theory about how this all

started...

LITTLE GIRL

Why did you do that?

LITTLE BOY

Because you smell like dog poo.

LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)

You're so stupid just like dog poo!

You're made of poo!

LITTLE GIRL

Made. (SOB)   Of. (SOB)   Dog. (SOB)   Poo.

MOM

Honey, do you know why that little boy

did those things? And said those things?

MOM (CONT'D)

Because he LIKES YOU.

1

GIGI (V.O.)

Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL?

Where did that rumor start? Because moms

have been spreading it for years.

MOM

That little boy is doing those terrible

things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

GIGI (V.O.)

Do you understand what this means? We

are all encouraged to believe that if a

guy acts like a total jerk -- that means

he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that

might serve us as five year olds, but

many of us keep believing this advice

well into adulthood.

GIGI (V.O.)

Then, as we get older, we carry on this

tradition of misreading the signals men

send by encouraging our friends to do the

same...

ROOMMATE #1

That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

I'm sure he just lost your number.

SECRETARY

He's not asking you out because he's

intimidated by your professional success

and emotional maturity.

2

CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1

Here's the problem. He likes you TOO

much. You're TOO pretty and awesome.        He

can't handle it.

CASHIER #1

Trust me. It's because he's just getting

out of a serious relationship.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1

Trust me. It's because he's never had a

serious relationship.

TOKYO GIRL #1 (SUBTITLE)

Shigeru's inability to commit clearly

stems from his failure to properly

imprint on his mother during breast

feeding.

FRIEND (SUBTITLE)

I'm sure he forgot your hut number.    Or

didn't get enough approval from his

father. Or was eaten by a giraffe.

GIGI (V.O.)

Why do we say this stuff to each other?

Why do we tell each other these lies?

(MORE)

3

GIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Is it possible that it's because we're

too scared, and it's too hard, to say the

one obvious truth that's staring everyone

in the face?

HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU...

GIGI

So, Janine told me you're a real estate

agent.

CONOR

Yeah. But don't worry - not one of the

cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus

benches and grocery carts.

GIGI

So just like on frisbees and notepads?

CONOR

You got it.

GIGI

Much classier.

CONOR

My thoughts exactly.

GIGI

I wonder why Janine never thought of

introducing us before?

CONOR

Yeah, I don't know, I ummm -

WAITRESS

You guys ready for another round?

4

CONOR

You want one more?

GIGI

Only if you do. But I mean, if you have

to get going I totally ...

CONOR

Umm.    OK.   Sure. One more.

CONOR (CONT'D)

You had Ketel and soda, right?

GIGI

Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.

CONOR

Yeah.    It was really nice meeting you.

GIGI

B-bye.

GIGI (CONT'D)

Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it

went well.

GIGI (CONT'D)

And I think he might me leaving me a

message at home as - we - speak.

5

CONOR

Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know

that I was thinking about you.

ANNA

Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you.

BEN

Do you want to go ahead?

ANNA

Hmm?

BEN

Go ahead?   You've only got two things.

ANNA

(into phone)

Hold on.

ANNA (CONT'D)

You've only got one thing.

BEN

Well, technically it's six. And I'm

still mulling over a gum purchase. So...

ANNA

(into phone)

Hey, let me call you right back.

6

EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

Oh my word.

ANNA

Come on. Seriously. I just deposited

money today. There's no way -

EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

It's not that. Let me check something.

EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

(CONT'D)

Congratulations. You won.

ANNA

What?

EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion.     You're

our 1000th customer in June.

ANNA

Are you kidding?

EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

Do I have that kind of manner? A joking

manner?

ANNA

I swear to god, this is the most exciting

thing that's ever happened to me.

BEN

Really?

ANNA

Is that sad?

7

BEN

No, it's - charming.     Congratulations.

ANNA

Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were

here first. I didn't win at all.

BEN

Yes, you did. Trust me - it's fate.      You

were meant to have that cooler.

ANNA

Thank you SO MUCH.

ALEX

Hey.    How was the date?

CONOR

Fine.   You know.

CONOR (CONT'D)

Why are you here?

ALEX

My cable's out.

CONOR

You didn't hear the phone ring, did you?

ALEX

Nope.

CONOR

Shit. Anna gave me the "I'll call you

right back."

ALEX

How long ago?

8

CONOR

22 minutes.

ALEX

Sorry, dude.

CONOR

Do I call back?

CONOR (CONT'D)

I know. I'll call back and say that I'm

going to bed.

ALEX

At 9:30 PM?    Genius.

CONOR

It is genius. Because then I can say:

"In case you were going to call me back -

don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping."

ALEX

Sounds foolproof.

CUT TO:

ANNA

Sorry.   What was I saying?

BEN

I think you were telling me how you don't

want to be like your mom and wake up and

realize you didn't pursue your dreams.

9

ANNA

Was I? Little intense for grocery store

chatter. Sorry.

BEN

It's OK. I might even be able to help

you out. There's a guy at my firm who

has exclusively music clients.

ANNA

That would be - amazing.      What are you -

like my savior?

BEN

OK. Look.      I'm married.   I don't do

this.

ANNA

Don't do what? Help struggling singers?

BEN

Help hot Pilates instructing singers who

happen to be very charming.

ANNA

Do you want to give me your card? That's

legit. I bet you're allowed to do that.

BEN

Right.   OK.   I guess that would be OK.

10

NEIL

So, who was that?

BEN

A prospective client.

NEIL

Yeah right.

BEN

I can talk to a woman Neil.        It doesn't

have to be like that.

BEN (CONT'D)

Just drive.

NEIL

Hey, babe.    You here?

BETH

Hey honey.

NEIL

Everything OK?

BETH

Yeah.   Just got off the phone.

NEIL

You want some tea or something?

BETH

It was my baby sister.        She's getting

married.

11

NEIL

That's great. I've always liked that

Devon guy. That's really great.

BETH

Do you think it's great?

NEIL

Yeah.

BETH

So, you think it's great that they're

getting married, but you never feel like

we're going against nature or something

by not getting married?

NEIL

No, babe.

NEIL (CONT'D)

Going against nature is like that cat who

started nursing that monkey. We're just

two people who aren't married.

BETH

Right.

NEIL

I actually think the odds of having a

successful relationship increase by not

getting married. Look at my parents -

all marriage got them was thirty two

years of misery and joint checking.

BETH

Yeah, I know. I get that.

NEIL

Like I've always told you - I love you -

and we don't need a marriage certificate

to legitimize our relationship.

BETH

Yeah.

NEIL

Lemme get you some tea.

12

JANINE

OK, so clearly he hasn't called.

JANINE (CONT'D)

Maybe he's away on business.

GIGI

He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

Staying in town is his business.

JANINE

Right.

JANINE (CONT'D)

Look, let me tell you - after the first

time I went out with Ben, he didn't call

me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And

now he's like the world's best husband.

That happens all the time.

GIGI

Really?

JANINE

Yes, really.

GIGI

This is all your fault.

JANINE

What?    Why?

13

GIGI

You set me up with him.

JANINE

No - you asked if I knew any guys and I

gave Conor your number. That's not a set

up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros

and cons. I do my due diligence. All I

know about Conor is he sold us this

house.

GIGI

He sold you a house in the ghetto.

JANINE

It's a neighborhood "in transition."

JANINE (CONT'D)

Seriously, stop.

GIGI

He said he always hangs at Red Maple

after work. Maybe I should do a little

drive-by?

JANINE

Please, don't. He'll call.

AMBER

Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever

happened to me. Total invasion of my

personal freedom. When a guy doesn't

call me, it is my right - my duty even -

to call him and hang up several thousand

times. Or at least until his mother

shouts at me in Albanian and blows a

police whistle into the phone. I mean,

calling and hanging up is an age old

expression of love and frustration and

too many wine coolers - and who is AT&

f'ing T to take that away from me?

(MORE)

14

AMBER (CONT'D)

Next thing you know, someone is going to

ban me from sitting in my car in front of

a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your

Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new

stupid girlfriend comes outside and

threatens to scratch my eyes out with her

acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves

freedom of expression, right?

GIGI

Mom, I gotta call you back.

JANINE

So, this was at the end of the date, or

at the beginning?

GIGI

End.   Why - does it matter?

JANINE

Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning

of the date is normal. "Nice meeting

you" at the end could be a blow off.

GIGI

Maybe it was at the beginning.

JANINE

Then that's fine. He's gonna call.

15

GIGI

Or maybe it was at the end.   Or maybe it

was nice to meet me.

JANINE

Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice

to meet you"?

GIGI

Shit.   I can't remember.

JANINE

"Nice to meet you" is OK. "Nice meeting

you" is like "Do you want your receipt in

the bag?"

BETH

Remember the days when you guys at least

pretended to be working when I came in?

BETH (CONT'D)

Janine, how's the press release?

JANINE

Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick,

the flavor expert, introduces five fun

filled flavors that will definitely

delight dessert divas!

BETH

Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration -

but otherwise good.

(to Gigi)

Where are we with the company newsletter?

GIGI

I am so almost done with that. It's just

been a little hard to focus on my article

about the two sets of twins in market

research, when the guy - who may or may

not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to

call me.

16

BETH

Look, after my first date with Neil, I

called him. There are no rules anymore.

Why should you have to wait for him to

get off his ass?

GIGI

It's ringing.

JANINE

Pretty standard.

GIGI

(listening to receiver)

Yes!   Voicemail.

JANINE

Your notes.

GIGI

(reading off her paper)

Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought,

I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how

stupid is it that a gal has got to wait

for a guy's call anyway, right?

GIGI (CONT'D)

(clearly ad-libbing)

I mean, we're all equal, right? More

than equal -- more women are accepted

into law school now than men, and we do

better in those police simulations where

you can mistakenly shoot innocent people -

(rifles through the pages)

- I mean I don't know if you saw that

Dateline - but women practically have

penises now, right?

(looks to Janine, helpless)

Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me.

17

JANINE

Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call.

GIGI

WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone?

GIGI (CONT'D)

Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now.

I'll call you back.

GIGI (CONT'D)

Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so

I'm on the precipice of staging a casual

run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want

to stop me.

(beat, then really fast)

ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS

tacit-compliance-bye.

KELLI ANN

Knock knock.

18

ALEX

Hey.

KELLI ANN

So.    Here we are. Same shift again.

ALEX

I know.    I make the schedule.

KELLI ANN

(FLIRTING)

I figured it was no coincidence.

KELLI ANN (CONT'D)

I had fun the other night.

ALEX

Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of

Patron will get you.

KELLI ANN

Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight

after work...we could, you know...

ALEX

Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between

us the other night was - fun. But we're

way understaffed tonight - I even have to

man the bar - and that's why I scheduled

you. To work. So...

ALEX (CONT'D)

Are we good here?

KELLI ANN

No.    We're good.

19

TYRONE

Dude.

ALEX

I know.

KELLI ANN

Are you joining us for dinner or -

GIGI

I'm meeting someone.       A guy.

KELLI ANN

Ugh.    Why?

GIGI

Hmmmm?

KELLI ANN

Nothing.   Sorry. For dinner?

GIGI

I'm meeting someone.

KELLI ANN

I believe you mentioned that.

20

GIGI

I'm gonna wait at the bar.

KELLI ANN

That's a great idea.

ALEX

What can I get you?

GIGI

Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone.

ALEX

Oh, yeah?    Got a hot date?

GIGI

I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I

mean this guy Conor and I have only been

out the one time so --

ALEX

Wait - Conor Barry?

GIGI

Oh, uhh, yeah --

ALEX

Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he

forget he was supposed to meet you?

GIGI

See when I said "meeting someone" I guess

that was kind of a broad term, kind of a

wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-

ALEX

Because I could just call him --

21

GIGI

NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I

mean, I actually was just - in the area -

so I figured I'd just swing by and see if

he was around - because - uhhh ---

GIGI (CONT'D)

I uhh, had to return his --

GIGI (CONT'D)

Pen. I had to return this - pen. He

left this. So, I thought I should really

return it before he - you know -

(conspiratorially to Alex)

-- freaks out.

ALEX

Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric

Dentistry.

GIGI

Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may

or may not be important to someone.

ALEX

That's not even his dentist.

GIGI

Oh, really?   Then who's his dentist?

ALEX

My dad.

GIGI

I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last

week. And I just...I thought if I ran

into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go.

22

ALEX

Hey. Just - hang out for a second.

Lemme buy you a drink.

ALEX

Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm

just gonna be honest - Conor is never

going to call you.

GIGI

Oh really? How do you know?

ALEX

Because I'm a guy.   It's how we do it.

GIGI

(HOPEFUL)

He said it was nice meeting me.

ALEX

I don't care if he said you were his

favorite female since his mommy and

Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by -

and he didn't call.

GIGI

But maybe he called me and I didn't get

the message. Or maybe he lost my number,

or was out of town, or was hit by a cab,

or his grandma died.

ALEX

Or maybe he just didn't call because he

has no interest in seeing you again.

GIGI

Yeah but my friend Terri once went out

with this guy who never called and she

totally wrote him off - then like a year

later she ran into him --

ALEX

Your friend Terri's an idiot.   And she's

the exception.

23

GIGI

OK.   But what if I'm the exception?

ALEX

You're not. You're the rule. And the

rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he

doesn't want to call you.

GIGI

Really?     Always?

ALEX

Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a

woman looks like. I do it early and I do

it often. Trust me - if a guy is

treating you like he doesn't give a shit -

- he doesn't. No exceptions.

GIGI

Why are you telling me all of this?

Aren't these man-secrets - like why men

need to watch televised golf?

ALEX

I don't know. You looked like you could

really use the help.

GIGI

Thank you. You've given me a lot to

think about.

JANINE

Everything OK?

GIGI

I was up all night.

JANINE

Please say you were working on the

newsletter.

24

GIGI

Sure. It's basically done.   But this is

important.

JANINE

What's happening with your hair?

BETH

Please come in my office before the

others see that you have mini muffin

stuck in your hair.

GIGI

I think I figured it out. Remember when

I went out with that notary public? And

he cheated on me? And then Anastasia

from upstairs told us that story about

how her boyfriend cheated on her at the

beginning - but then he totally changed

and they're married and crazy in love.

BETH

I thought that guy was a process server.

GIGI

No, notary. Anyway, the point is -

Anastasia is the exception. Not the

rule. We have to stop listening to these

stories - because the rule is that most

guys who cheat on you up front don't

really care about you very much.

BETH

Okay...

GIGI

Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived

in his storage space. He only used me

for rides, yet I continued to stalk him

for most of 1998. Then there was Don,

who broke up with me every Friday so he

could have his weekends free. I was so

delusional about our relationship that I

referred to him as my husband to random

people like my dental hygenist.

(MORE)

25

GIGI (CONT'D)

And all my friends would tell me stories

about how things might work out with

these dipshits because they knew someone

who knew someone who dated a dipshit just

like mine, and that girl ended up getting

married and living happily ever after.

But that's the exception. And we're not

the exception - we're the rule.

BETH

OK. So let me see if I understand. What

you're saying is that when people tell me

about some girl they know who dated a guy

for thirteen years, and then he finally

married her -- that's the exception. And

the rule is that guys - like Neil - who

are with girls - like me - for seven

years without getting married - are never

getting married.

GIGI

No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm

saying. This has absolutely nothing to

do with you. I was just talking, you

know, about me. Specifically.

ANNA

It is impossible not to like this guy.

I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting

with me outside Eddie's, and then he

tells me he's married. You'd think I'd

be pissed, but I literally could not stop

myself from liking him.

MARY

But he's married.

ANNA

I realize that. I keep trying to force

myself to picture him in some church

saying vows to some woman, and even that

doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?

26

MARY

OK. There was this guy who worked in my

dad's printing business. Married for

fifteen years to a nice lady. And then

he meets this woman at some church event.

And he told my dad he just had never felt

anything like it before. I mean, he had

finally met the love of his life. So, he

divorced his wife, and he's been with

this other woman for 22 years and they

are blissfully happy. I mean, what if

you meet the love of your life - but you

already married someone else? Are you

supposed to pass them by?

ANNA

You're right. I'm calling him.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Hey, Ben.    This is Anna Marks.

BEN (O.S.)

Hey, Anna.   What's up?

ANNA

Well, I was just taking you up on your

offer. You said you might know someone

who could help me out and I thought we

could discuss it -- over coffee?

BEN (O.S.)

Look, I just...I can't Anna. You seem

great. It's just - I don't know. I

should go. Take care.

CONOR

I am so psyched that you called.

27

ANNA

Cool.

CONOR

I had sort of given up on you when you

didn't call me back the other night.

ANNA

Well, you know. I was just thinking

about you.

ANNA

Your turn.

CONOR

OK.   Give me the categories again.

ANNA

There are four. Sexy, smart, funny or

cute. And each person can only be two.

Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and

sexy. Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.

CONOR

I love that you are hot for Clinton.

ANNA

So, which am I?

CONOR

What was I again?

ANNA

Smart and cute.

CONOR

OK.   You're sexy. Very sexy.    And cute.

ANNA

No. Cute and sexy are in the looks

column. No one wants to be in all one

column.

28

CONOR

Well, I sound like a jackass if I say

you're all four. But you're so obviously

all four. Especially sexy.

ANNA

You're the best.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I better go.

CONOR

Oh. OK. I mean, you could just stay

here tonight.

CONOR (CONT'D)

What?   It's been a while.

ANNA

I know. It's just - I'm fried.    Is that

alright?

CONOR

Sure.   Of course.

NEIL

Hey babe, is this straight?

BETH

Why are you hanging that?

NEIL

I told you I'd do it weeks ago.   You

don't like it there?

BETH

I love it there. But just - stop.

29

NEIL

It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see

it before, but - you're right - it

totally looks like a sagging boob.

NEIL (CONT'D)

You want me to take it down?

BETH

No.     I want you stop doing anything nice.

NEIL

Is this a trick?

BETH

No. I need you to stop being nice to me -

unless you're gonna marry me after.

BETH (CONT'D)

Is that funny?

NEIL

No.     It was just - I was just--

BETH

See, you can't keep being nice to me and

I can't keep pretending like this is

something that it's not. We've been

together over seven years. You know me.

You either want to marry me or you don't.

NEIL

Or there is the possibility that I just

don't really believe in the concept of -

BETH

BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every

woman who's been told by some guy that he

doesn't believe in marriage just to see

him turn around eight months later and

marry some twenty four year old girl he

met at the gym. Bullshit.

NEIL

Honey, where is all this coming from?

30

BETH

From the place that I have been hiding

from you for the last five years because

I didn't want to seem demanding, or

clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never

ask. But now I'm going to ---

BETH (CONT'D)

Are you ever going to marry me?

BETH (CONT'D)

I can't do this anymore.

AMY

I was with Damon for six years. He asked

me to marry him on the phone, because

he's just so different and cool like

that. Said he'd eventually get me a

ring, which he didn't, but he did buy

himself a ring because isn't that so

hilarious and cool that the guy is

wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part

is, I stayed with him even after he took

back his proposal, and introduced the

idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't

that a cute name? Let me explain the

concept: it involves dating a girl from

the time she's thirty two to the time

she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her

of the ability to bear children, and

then, after all that, wanting to take a

year off. And giving it a fun name that

you can put on t-shirts.

(looks at the baby, smiles)

I left him.

31

BEN

Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know

it's been a little while since you

called. I just - it took me by surprise.

But I offered to help you with your

career, and I don't see why I can't do

that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe

you can come by the office this week or

something. Okay, take care. Bye.

JANINE

Hey, how --

BEN

Shit - you scared me.

JANINE

Is everything OK?

BEN

Yeah.   Everything's fine.   Why?

JANINE

Are you smoking again?

BEN

No, sweetie.    Why?

JANINE

Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.

BEN

I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry

about what color we're gonna paint this

room, instead of worrying about things

that aren't happening?

JANINE

I don't know - I was thinking maybe -

pink?

32

BEN

Pink?   Seriously?

JANINE

Well, I mean, at some point.

BEN

You sure we're ready for this now?

JANINE

No. But I mean, we could paint one room

pink and one blue just in case.

BEN

You've already created the perfect family

in this house, and we don't even have

drywall.

JANINE

I'm sorry. I know I promised we'd wait

to talk about it -

BEN

I think we're almost ready to start

talking about it.

JANINE

I've always liked the name Gisele.

JARRAD

Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back

to the office.

GIGI

You go back to the office after happy

hour? What's happy about that?

33

JARRAD

I met you.

JARRAD (CONT'D)

So, I'd love to call you sometime.    Do

you have a card?

GIGI

Of course.

JARRAD

And here's my info.

JARRAD (CONT'D)

Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

GIGI

So, wait -- how are we doing this? Are

you hearing from me or am I getting a

call?

JARRAD

What?

GIGI

You said you'd love to call me, but then

you said "look forward to hearing from

you." See how that's kinda confusing?

JARRAD

Look - we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

GIGI

Ooopsie - you did it again. Very vague.

You know what? Why don't we just say

that you'll call me, and then we can skip

all the nonsense.

34

GIGI (CONT'D)

Or I guess I could just call you --

JARRAD

Goodbye, Gigi.

GIGI

He was cute.

JANINE

Please don't cyber-stalk him.

JANINE (CONT'D)

Wait - what are you doing?

GIGI

I'm not calling him.    If he wants to see

me - he'll call.

JANINE

Wow, that guy Alex really made an

impression on you. Was he hot?

GIGI

No.   He was just -- right.

BRUCE

So?

MARY

He asked me out.

35

NATHAN

Oh my god!    He called?

MARY

Well -

JOSHUA

He emailed?

MARY

Umm -

BRUCE

What? Did he travel by carriage and

leave his calling card with your lady in

waiting?

MARY

He MySpaced me.

NATHAN

Ouch.

JOSHUA

I don't know. My slutty sister says

MySpace is the new booty call.

MARY

Well, what am I supposed to do? Things

have changed. People don't just meet

organically anymore. If I want to make

myself more attractive to the opposite

sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I

update my profile. That's just how it

is.

MARY (CONT'D)

Back to work.

MARY (CONT'D)

Ad sales - this is Mary.

36

CONOR

Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend.

Or whatever.

MARY

Hey.   So, did you see it?

CONOR

I'm not sure about this.

MARY

You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning

market. You're gonna make a fortune.

CONOR

Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you

have to put me on the page with the

massage ads?

MARY

It was either that or on the page with

the personals. I made a call.

CONOR

OK. You're right.      Hey, have you talked

to Anna lately?

CATHERINE

I do not understand how you got mom to

sew all of these in two weeks.

PAIGE

She wanted to do it.

37

LAURA

Mom told me she felt like an old

Indonesian lady in a sweatshop.

PAIGE

No, she didn't.

BETH

Why again do you need to get married so

fast?

CATHERINE

You're so pregnant.

PAIGE

I'm not pregnant.

CATHERINE

Chug a beer, then. I want to see you

chug a beer.

PAIGE

We're in love, you assholes. That's what

people do when they're in love - they get

married.

PAIGE (CONT'D)

Bethie, you know I didn't mean --

BETH

It's OK.    Neil and I are actually - done -

anyway.

CATHERINE

Why didn't you tell us?    You should have

told us.

LAURA

You have to come over and have dinner

with me and Steven and the kids tonight,

OK? You can even stay over if you want.

CATHERINE

Why would she want to hang out with us

and our husbands? Seriously, Beth, isn't

that exactly what you want to avoid right

now?

38

PAIGE

You know what - if being in the wedding

is too painful-

BETH

You guys, it's cool. I'm fine.    So I

lost a little time. Big deal.

CATHERINE

So not a big deal. You're still really

young.

PAIGE

So young.

LAURA

Everything you learned in that

relationship is just gonna make the next

one so much stronger.

BETH

Exactly.

LAURA

She wasted so much time.

CATHERINE

I knew he was never gonna propose.

PAIGE

Shit.

BEN

I know it's here somewhere. I spoke to

George Lane in music, and he gave me this

whole list of references for you.

ANNA

It's cool.    You can call me when you find

it.

39

BEN

I swear I didn't lure you here under

false pretenses.

ANNA

I know.   But a girl can dream.

ANNA (CONT'D)

You're obviously too good of a guy.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Why are you married, again?

ANNA (CONT'D)

Seriously. Why? It'll be good for me.

Tell me how you decided that you could

not be without this other woman.

BEN

We'd been together since college. She

gave me an ultimatum: we get married or

we break up. So, we got married.

ANNA

Seriously?   You just caved?

BEN

It's complicated.

ANNA

Really?

BEN

You're a dick if you date a girl for too

long, and don't marry her. But you marry

her, and then you're an asshole for

marrying her before you're ready. Shit -

I don't know.

40

BEN (CONT'D)

You're really hot and I'm obviously

attracted to you, but I guess the best I

can do is eventually find this piece of

paper, and call you, and hope I help in

some small way with your career, and be

happy about that.

JANINE

JAVIER!

JANINE (CONT'D)

JAVIER. I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT

TARPING THE FURNITURE.

GIGI

Hi, this is Gigi.

41

ALEX

Gigi?

GIGI

Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist

pen.

ALEX

Right.

GIGI

I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I

thought you had some really good insights

the other night and -- I had a question.

ALEX

Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor

is never going to be interested in you.

GIGI

No, I know. This is about -

(she looks at the card)

- Jarrad. You have a sec?

ALEX

Okay...

GIGI

So I meet him at happy hour and he was

completely charming --

ALEX

Lemme guess - he said the only thing

happy about this hour is you.

GIGI

He may have used some derivative of that.

So, he says he's going to call, but then

gave me his card and --

ALEX

He's not interested.

GIGI

You don't even know if he called --

ALEX

Did he?

GIGI

No. But the thing is, I honestly think

he's expecting my call.

(MORE)

42

GIGI (CONT'D)

He said "Look forward to hearing from

you" and not "Look forward to talking to

you." I mean, do you hear the

connotations?

ALEX

He.   Is.   Not. Interested.

TYRONE

Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is

giving me shit for not wearing a white

shirt -- this shirt is WHITE!

TYRONE    (O.S.) (CONT'D)

This shit is white.

ALEX

If a guy gives you his phone number,

instead of taking yours, he's not

interested.

GIGI

He took mine first, but then he --

ALEX

And, if a guy wants to see you, he will

see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's

until I got the right one.

GIGI

That's cute.    What happened?

ALEX

As it turned out, her ass looked really

huge in daylight.

GIGI

Is it your sensitivity that makes you so

popular with women?

ALEX

Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

GIGI

Again with the sensitivity.

ALEX

Just trying to help.

43

GIGI

I know.   Thanks.

MAYA

Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me

anything.

ANNA

Mom - you always say that and I always

get you something.

MAYA

You didn't.

ANNA

It's no big deal.

CONOR

What is it?

CONOR (CONT'D)

Tim Buckley.    Nice.

MAYA

Here - put on my favorite.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim

Buckley?

CONOR

No.   She did not.

44

MAYA

We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell's

Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But

he had this big mop of hair and these

eyes that just looked past you and

through you and into you all at the same

time. Complete interest and disinterest.

It was amazing.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Of course, I was with Anna's father at

the time, so, you know...another

opportunity missed.

ANNA

Mom, please -

MAYA

It's the truth. I knew them all. Robert

Plant, Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons...

(to Conor)

Have you seen the pictures of me from

when I was Anna's age?

CONOR

Umm - I don't think so -

MAYA

Sweetie go get that picture - you know

the one -

MAYA (CONT'D)

Go. Your mother's asking you to do

something for her on her birthday.

MAYA (CONT'D)

You'll see - we look strikingly similar.

My lips may be a bit fuller, but...

45

CONOR

Wow.   That's - unbelievable.

MAYA

So that's what we're dealing with here,

for reference. Imagine meeting someone

who looks like that in a coffee shop.

CONOR

That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I

kinda did. Anna and I met at a

restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not

a coffee shop, but...still -

MAYA

That's sweet. But if we're comparing

stories -

(indicating with her glass)

She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Anyone need a refill?

ANNA

Thanks again for coming with me.        You

make it so much easier.

CONOR

Are you kidding? I like your mom.        She's

cool.

ANNA

Yeah, well - cool's not always what

you're looking for in a mom.

CONOR

So, you want another -- foot rub?

46

ANNA

Ugh. I'm just beat. I wanna put on

sweats and get in bed.

CONOR

I'd be into that.

ANNA

I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

TRENT

If a girl is into you, she's sleeping

with you. And if after a month - two

months at the very outside - she's not

sleeping with you, she does not like you.

I guess the trick is, how to spot this

girl early - so you don't waste the one

to seven weeks waiting to find out that

it's never gonna happen. So, I've got

some signs about how to spot this girl -

gleaned from my own experience, of

course. A girl will never sleep with you

if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,

she pops a zit in front of you, her name

is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump

in your bathroom or she takes home

leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not

scientific - but I'm just saying - you

were warned.

ALEX

Hey dude - you here?

CONOR (O.S.)

Yep.

47

ALEX

Wanna beer?

ALEX (CONT'D)

Or an apple martini?

CONOR

Funny.

ALEX

Need I ask?

CONOR

It's for work. I'm trying to expand my

client base.

ALEX

By pretending you're gay?

CONOR

No.   By being more gay friendly.

ALEX

Or, in real estate terms, by becoming

"gay adjacent".

CONOR

Nice.    I may have to use that.

CONOR (CONT'D)

I'm gonna try something else. This may be

too much.

ALEX

I don't know. You dress like that - and

you're already seeing a girl who won't

sleep with you - I think maybe you can

pull it off.

CONOR (O.S.)

It's not that she won't sleep with me

douchebag...I have slept with her. It's

just, you know, she...um...

48

ALEX

Won't sleep with you anymore.

CONOR

Pretty much, yeah.

(re: his new outfit)

So, what do you think?

ALEX

I think you're gonna have to beat 'em

away with a stick - you hot, sexy man.

GIGI

Who would have thought that a random girl

from Pilates would fix me up with such a

good kisser?

GREGORY

Back at you sister.

GIGI

I can't wait to kiss you again.

GREGORY

Umm.   We're kissing right now.

GIGI

I know. But next time. The second date

kiss is way more intimate.

GREGORY

Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so

I'll be out of touch for a bit.

49

GIGI

Would you excuse me a quick second?    Too

many diet cokes...

ALEX

Yup.

GIGI

Hey, sorry to bug you again.   Quick

question.

ALEX

(to his hot lady)

Would you excuse me a second, babe?

GIGI

I'm making out with a guy - PG stuff -

and then he mentions he's going out of

town, so he's gonna be out of touch.

ALEX

Run.

GIGI

But maybe he is going out of town.

ALEX

To where? The Arab Emirates? Where is

he going that he has to be out of touch?

GIGI

Where are you going out of town to again?

GREGORY (O.S.)

Pittsburgh.

50

GIGI

Pittsburgh.

ALEX

Run.

GIGI

So, now what? I'm just supposed to run

from every guy who doesn't like me?

ALEX

Uhh - yeah.

GIGI

There's not going to be anyone left.

ALEX

OK, I don't know why I'm saying this -

but I actually think I know a nice guy

who you might like.

GIGI

Yeah?

ALEX

Yeah. He's a friend of my brother's.

Bill. We'll all meet for a drink - it'll

be good.

GIGI

So, I'm in his bathroom right now.   What

do I now?

ALEX

You gotta come out eventually. But I'd

really take my time. Let him sweat.

BEN

So, we ran into each other.

ANNA

You came to my class.

51

BEN

I didn't know it was your class.

ANNA

You called and asked me.

BEN

But you didn't call me back.

ANNA

Because you said not to call back if it

was my class. Which it was.

BEN

We ran into each other.

ANNA

Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by

happenstance - doing their daily workout

near one another.

BEN

Exactly.   Thank you.

ANNA

Wanna swim?

BEN

I was just thinking - why can't we be

friends? Am I not allowed to make

friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be

friends with hot people? What kind of

reverse prejudice is that?

ANNA

I hear you. Am I supposed to not be

friends with a guy just because he's

married, and happens to have this insane

smile and this ass that makes me want to

dry hump?

52

BEN

I think I just fell in love.   A girl who

talks about a dry hump.

ANNA

Classy, right?

BEN

Classy is lame.

ANNA

So, friends, right?

BEN

Totally.

ANNA

You wanna come in?

BEN

I'm sorry.   I don't trust myself.

ANNA

OK.   You can just watch.

BEN

You may be the best friend I've ever had.

JANINE

Honey - you smell different.

BEN

Different how?

JANINE

I don't know.

53

BEN

Well that's an odd thing to say.

JANINE

Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I

found. In the side yard. What part of

"my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for

you to wrap your brain around?

BEN

What?

JANINE

Do not lie to me, Ben.      Please.

BEN

Are you serious? We have like eight

thousand undocumented workers in this

house daily. You find cigarettes, and

you automatically assume they're mine?

JANINE

Well, yes.

BEN

Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really

freaking out. I think the renovation is

getting to you because nothing is going

on. Just please - relax.

NEIL

Ah.     My first visitor.

BEN

This boat is sick. How come you never

invited me out before?

NEIL

Well, this was supposed to be just for

Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave

our jobs. Sell the house. Take off.

54

NEIL (CONT'D)

Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission

to board granted. I'll show you around.

NEIL

(re: cigarette)

Sorry.

BEN

It's OK.

NEIL

So Janine sent you to check on me?

BEN

Yeah.    Pretty much.

NEIL

Any message from Beth?

BEN

I think she's been busy getting ready for

her sister's funeral though, so...

NEIL

Her sister's what?

BEN

Wedding.    Her sister's wedding.   What did

I say?

NEIL

You said funeral.

BEN

No, I didn't. Shit, did I?

55

NEIL

The marriage thing is weird, man. I

never thought Beth would give me an

ultimatum.

BEN

Really?     Why not?   That's what women do.

NEIL

Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got

you to bite the bullet.

BEN

Yup.

NEIL

Do you regret it?

BEN

No.

NEIL

So you're happy? You'd say you're

happily married?

BEN

I love Janine.

COUSIN

Now, I know when my cousin Paige says

those vows tomorrow, there are going to

be hearts breaking all over the world.

COUSIN (CONT'D)

So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is

still on the market.

56

COUSIN (CONT'D)

Sure, she's an older model, but she's

still got a lot of miles left in her.

But don't stay on the lot too long,

Bethie, or next year's models will --

KEN

OK - that's enough of the speeches. Time

to eat. So enjoy the crab. And the

yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the

crab's hepatopancreas.

KEN (CONT'D)

Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a

jackass.

BETH

I know.    And even he's married.

KEN

So, you'll get married a little bit later

than some people. Big deal. You never

did anything the way every one else did

it, and that's what I've always thought

was so great about you.

BETH

I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the

only one not married. If this was

Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to

sacrifice me or something.

KEN

Honey, look. When everyone else was just

going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my

New York Times, found some arts camp in

the Berkshires, wrote away for

information, then got accepted on your

own. You were nine. You never did

things the way everyone else did.

BETH

Why not?

57

KEN

Because that's you.   That's why you're my

favorite daughter.

BETH

I don't think you're supposed to say

that.

KEN

Well, I don't give a shit. I'm retired,

and I'll say what I want. I'll say it

into the mic if you want --

BETH

That's OK.

KEN

It's true, though.

BETH

I know.

ALEX

Sorry I'm late.

GIGI

That's OK. I like a little time before a

blind date - prepare myself mentally,

remind myself not to tell the story about

my molars --

ALEX

He's not coming.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Can't wait to hear that story about the

molars, though.

GIGI

How can he already not like me?

58

ALEX

I screwed up. I told Bill it was

Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.

GIGI

Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who

can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday -

and meanwhile this girl -

(motions to GIRL at the bar)

- she's probably meeting her soul mate

as we speak.

ALEX

Nope.

GIGI

How do you know?

ALEX

See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise

thing. She's interested. He's not.

GIGI

You cannot tell from a cursory glance

that he's not interested.

ALEX

Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant.

I see this stuff go down every night.

Watch --

GIGI

Man, you have a gift.

ALEX

And check out droopy dawg on her other

side. He can buy her drinks all night,

and she'll insist there's no "spark."

GIGI

Maybe there isn't.   You need a spark.

ALEX

The "spark" thing is bullshit.

59

GIGI

Really?    Enlighten me.

ALEX

Guys invented the "spark" so they could

not call and treat you kind of bad and

keep you guessing, and then convince you

that the anxiety and fear that it creates

in you is actually a "spark." And you

all buy it. You love it. You all thrive

on it because you all love drama.

GIGI

I don't.

ALEX

Really? So you don't wait until the last

minute on deadlines, or on phone bills,

because you love the drama of not knowing

whether you'll make it?

GIGI

Maybe.

ALEX

And let me guess - when you were stalking

Conor that night - were you obsessing

about him calling for days, even though

the date was just kind of mediocre?

GIGI

OK.   Yeah.

ALEX

See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be

more like me - if a girl likes me great,

if not, there are plenty more like her -

probably with smaller pores and bigger

implants.

GIGI

That's beautiful.

ALEX

Thanks.

GIGI

Why are you sharing all this inside

dating information with me again?

60

ALEX

I dunno.    I like you.

GIGI

You do?

ALEX

Don't start doodling my name on your

binder. I just mean, I like you, like I

like basset hounds. They're kinda

pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.

GIGI

Again with the sensitivity.

JANINE

It looks good.

JAVIER

Yes.

JANINE

He does good work.

JAVIER

He's very good.

JANINE

Javier.

JAVIER

Yes.

JANINE

Javier, if I asked you an honest

question, do you think you could give me

an honest answer?

JAVIER

I think so.

JANINE

Good. Because I think some of your guys

have been - smoking.

61

JANINE (CONT'D)

Javier?

JAVIER

Is that the question?

JANINE

Yes.

JAVIER

Oh.    It seemed like a statement.

JANINE

The question part was implied -

JAVIER

I didn't really hear it in the inflection-

JANINE

Javier - have your guys been smoking or

not?

JAVIER

No, ma'am. My guys don't smoke on the

job site. They're all good guys.

JANINE

Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking

around here? And smoking? And lying to

me? And -- smoking?

JAVIER

I'm pretty sure.

JANINE

I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

Because I can't have someone lying to me.

To my face. Under my roof. On my time.

JAVIER

(very softly)

That's a lot of prepositions...

JANINE

I mean, there is no reason for that kind

of dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I

mean, we made promises to one another --

62

JANINE (CONT'D)

What I mean is, we had a contract. Which

is like making promises to each other,

right?

JAVIER

Maybe I should just get back to work.

JANINE

Yes.   Fine.    Good idea.

JANINE (CONT'D)

But, we're good here, right?     Me and you?

JANINE (CONT'D)

Okay, great.     The molding really does

look great.

CONOR

Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in

whenever you get a chance.

ANNA

This is insane. You're like the Liza

Minelli of real estate.

CONOR

I know.    Your friend Mary's a genius.

ANNA

Alright.   Gotta run.

63

CONOR

You got a class?

ANNA

Uh, no.   Just some stuff.    See you later?

CONOR

Sure.

CONOR (CONT'D)

What?

SKIP

She's holding out on you, isn't she?

CONOR

I'm not sure I get your meaning.

LARRY

It's obvious. She won't sleep with you.

It's written all over your puppy dog

face.

CONOR

It's killing me. Literally.     I'm dying.

LARRY

Here, have a cookie.

CONOR

I just - I have no idea what she's doing.

I cannot read her signals - at all. We

used to sleep together - all the time.

Well, that's not true, I don't know why I

said that, it wasn't all the time. But

it did happen - I know I'm not making

this up. And then, out of nowhere, it

stops. But she still calls, she stops

by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a

massage, she leaves cute messages - but

it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is

she doing?

64

LARRY

Honestly - we may not have the best

insight. Gay signals have nothing to do

with straight signals.

SKIP

He's right. Like - here's "I want to

sleep with you".

LARRY

One, two, three - that's it.   Three

seconds or more - it's on.

SKIP

Here's "I don't want to sleep with you."

LARRY

One, two -

(he looks away)

No. Thanks for playing.    Move along.

SKIP

It's that simple.

CONOR

You're right. That's no help at all.

LARRY

But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or

straight, you're not going to get

anywhere by being inactive. She clearly

likes you - maybe she just wants you to

be a man and do something. So the next

time you're in the position - don't take

no for an answer.

SKIP

That sounds like felonious advice.

LARRY

You're right. Let me rephrase.    Don't

take maybe for an answer.

65

BEN

Wait.   Stop.

ANNA

What?

BEN

Shit.   This is bad.

ANNA

What?

BEN

I am so into you.

BEN (CONT'D)

I'm lying here watching you and I

seriously have never felt this way

before. I have to forcibly make my brain

stop thinking about you. I mean, all the

time.

ANNA

Why stop?

BEN

Because I don't do stuff like this.

ANNA

Stuff like what?

BEN

Like having sex with women who are not my

wife.

ANNA

First of all, I'm not women.   I'm just

one.

BEN

What's second of all?

66

ANNA

I didn't have a second of all.

BEN

I thought second of all was going to make

me feel better.

ANNA

Second of all - I can't stop thinking

about you, either.

BEN

I have to tell her.

ANNA

What?

BEN

I have to tell her.

ANNA

I don't want to push you to --

BEN

I want to be with you. And I can't do

that if I'm lying to her.

ANNA

You know what's best.

LOUIS

Here's the thing - my daughter is happily

married with kids and running a tanning

salon on Staten Island. But if she

wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd

like to tell a lot of the girls that come

in and out of this building on the arm of

a married guy.

(MORE)

67

LOUIS (CONT'D)

And here is that advice --- get stocks,

cash, annuities, a deed in your name.

Don't settle for flowers and a shopping

spree at Bendel's. Think to the future.

We all know that none of these guys is

gonna leave his society wife and let her

keep half the money and the classic eight

on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these

young ladies, as long as you only have

the guy for a finite period of time --

get something that can last. Because I

guarantee you - he won't. And that's the

best fatherly advice I can give.

ANNA

I'm not picking out china patterns or

anything - but I've never felt anything

like this before.

MARY

This is crazy. I can't believe he's

gonna leave his wife for you.

ANNA

No, he's not leaving his wife for me.

He's just - he's a good guy. And he

can't really explore what we could be if

he's lying to her.

ANNA (CONT'D)

He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is

this crazy? This is totally crazy. We

barely know each other.

MARY

I don't know.   Remember Becca, my

sister's friend. Some guy waits on her

at Bennigan's - by the end of the night

they both knew they had found the one.

ANNA

You're totally right.   It can happen.

MARY

Not for me.

68

ANNA

Well, what about texter?

MARY

Texter has yet to make any verbal

contact. I mean, this guy could have had

surgery that left him without a voice

box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd

never know because I never actually hear

his voice.

ANNA

I doubt he has a stoma -

MARY

That's not the point. The point is - I

can't text. I'm not charming via text.

My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't

type fast enough on the little phone

keyboard --

ANNA

So don't text.

MARY

It's not just texting. It's email and

voicemail and snail mail -

ANNA

That's just mail -

MARY

Whatever. None of it's working. I've

had a guy leave a voicemail for me at

work, and then I call him back at home,

and he emails me to my Blackberry, and

then I text him to his cell and then he

emails me to my home account from the

plane phone -- and it just totally gets

out of hand. I miss the days where you

had one phone number with one answering

machine that housed one cassette tape and

either the cassette tape had a message

from the guy or it didn't. That's it.

Now you have to go around checking all

your portals and get rejected by seven

different technologies. It's exhausting.

ANNA

So what about the singer guy?

69

MARY

Jude.    Yeah, I like him.

ANNA

That's great.

MARY

Totally.     I felt like we connected.

GIGI

Hello.

ALEX

Oh, hey.     You're home.

GIGI

Where am I supposed to be?

ALEX

Out.    It's Saturday night.

GIGI

You won't let me go out with guys who

don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

ALEX

I was just calling to let you know - I'm

having a party at my place next weekend.

You should come.

GIGI

I don't know. Won't Conor be there?

Might be kinda awkward.

ALEX

He's in DC for the weekend at some real

estate conference. But there's gonna be

a bunch of single guys.

70

GIGI

So I will have plenty of chances to be

awkward. Thank god.

ALEX

Don't worry. I'll be there.      I'll talk

you through it.

GIGI

So, the party - is it like a big party,

more of a mellow hang or --

ALEX

Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone

just dropped 84 wine glasses.

WATTS

Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll

be swept off her feet at the touch of

your amateur lips.

KEITH

I think I can handle it.

WATTS

It's cool. I was just gonna work on it

with you but - if you're

comfortable...great.

KEITH

Wait.   How do you work on it?

WATTS

Pretend I'm a girl, OK?    I mean, pretend

I'm her...Amanda.

71

GIGI

He's into me.

JANINE

Awesome. I knew it.

(she hugs Gigi)

Who's this now?

GIGI

Alex. It's totally clear to me now.

He's Watts.

JANINE

What?

GIGI

From Some Kind of Wonderful.

JANINE

Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?

GIGI

Yes.

JANINE

So, why aren't you Watts?

GIGI

I'm Eric Stoltz.

JANINE

What?

GIGI

Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric

Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones,

but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz

herself.

JANINE

Wait - so who's Amanda Jones?

GIGI

I guess Conor at first. Now men in

general. But that's not the point.    The

point is -- he's into me.

JANINE

You know, I knew there had to be a reason

he was spending all that time with you.

72

GIGI

I know! It's so obvious now -- there are

so many signs.

JANINE

Oooh, gimme the signs.   I love to hear

about the signs.

GIGI

At first they were small - like when I

first called he said "Good to hear from

you" -

JANINE

Totally good sign.

GIGI

Right? And then the next time I called

he was with a woman - but he still took

the call. And talked to me for a while.

JANINE

You know it was a woman?

GIGI

He called her "babe."

JANINE

A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to

another woman - unless there's something

going on.

GIGI

I know! And it gets more obvious. I

mean, please - there was no guy he was

going to fix me up with. The fix up was

him.

JANINE

Wait - really?

GIGI

He shows up - without this fictitious

Bill character - and the two of us

basically have a date. And then he calls

me to invite me to a party at his place.

JANINE

You're right. He so likes you.

73

JANINE (CONT'D)

Let's look up places for your destination

wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa

Valley - I've always wanted to go there.

MARY

There's no way he's already called - we

only met for coffee last night. I mean

we video iChatted. While holding coffee.

Kinda like having coffee.

NATHAN

Just call your voice mail.

MARY

And he told me he had a gig last night,

so he probably got in real late. Did I

tell you he was singer?

BRUCE

Just call.

JOSHUA

On speaker.

YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.)

(SINGING, in a sexy voice)

Maaaary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary.   Oh

my Maaary.

NATHAN

I just got hard.

74

YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.)

Hey Mary, it's Jude. Just wanted to tell

you again how special it was to meet you.

So, call me back. Bye.

BRUCE

Amazing.    He'll sing to your babies.

YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.)

(SINGING, from speakerphone)

Jeeeeny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jeeeeny.

YOUR SOUL-UTION (CONT'D)

Hey Jenny, it's Jude. Just wanted to --

oh shit, - what number did I call?

AUTOMATED VOICE

ALL MESSAGES DELETED.

JANINE

That one.

BEN

No.   That's the laminate.

JANINE

That one isn't real hardwood floor?

BEN

No. But it looks exactly the same - at

like one one hundredth of the cost.

75

JANINE

I still wanna go with the real wood.

BEN

But you can't even tell the difference.

JANINE

That's not the point.

BEN

Then what's the point?

JANINE

I just don't like the way it's pretending

to be wood. If you're not wood, then

don't try to look like wood.

BEN

I don't think it's pretending --

JANINE

It's a lie. Just be up front - tell

people what you really are.

BEN

You're right. I'm sorry.      You're totally

right.

JANINE

It's OK. Maybe we should look at the

grills and come back.

BEN

I slept with someone.

BEN (CONT'D)

I --

JANINE

I heard you.

76

JANINE (CONT'D)

You tell me this in Home Depot because

you know how I hate a public scene.

BEN

That is not why I -

JANINE

I knew it.     I KNEW IT.   You asshole.

BEN

I'm sorry.    I'm so sorry.

JANINE

And it's you that's been smoking, too,

isn't it?

BEN

What?   Why does that matter?

JANINE

HAVE - YOU - BEEN - SMOKING?

BEN

No.   No.    I haven't.

BEN (CONT'D)

Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I

could stay on his boat for a while if --

JANINE

EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out?

You're like - what - leaving me?

BEN

No. NO. I just assumed that you

wouldn't want me to --

JANINE

We're not going to deal with this? We're

not going to figure out a way to work

through this?

77

BEN

I just assumed that once I told you, you

would want me -- out.

JANINE

Is that what you want?

BEN

(almost a whisper)

No.

JANINE

OK.

DAN

You must be Beth.

BETH

Yep.

DAN

I've heard a lot about you from Paige.

I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated

next to her single sister.

BETH

Oh, yeah? So you are -

(looks at his placecard)

Dan.

78

DAN

Uh, sort of.

BETH

Hmmm?

DAN

Well, I'm actually a wiccan.    So I have a

magickal name.

BETH

Really?

DAN

It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I

didn't know if that would fit on a card.

NATHAN

It makes your breath stink.

GIGI

Pardon?

NATHAN

Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I

made out with a guy after eating like a

bag of the stuff. He said my breath

smelled like trout.

GIGI

Thanks for the tip.

NATHAN

I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy

I made out with was a total asshole.

79

BRUCE

You want me to smell you?   I'm sure you

don't smell like trout.

GIGI

Thanks.   I'm good.

NATHAN

I'm Nathan.   This is Bruce.

GIGI

Gigi.   How do you guys know Alex?

BRUCE

We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it

from some guy named Conor.

NATHAN

How do you know Alex?

GIGI

I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure -

something is about to happen between us.

NATHAN

So, you're here as like a guest, or like

his date?

BRUCE

I hate that - when you don't know if

you're a date - so you don't know if you

should bring a friend, or if you're like

co-hosting or if you should stay til the

end to have alone time --

GIGI

He didn't really say.

GIGI (CONT'D)

But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

I mean - there have been signs.

80

NATHAN

Cool.

BRUCE

I did get a slight waft of trout, though.

Take a mint.

GIGI

Thank you.

DOMINIC

So, where's Neil?

BETH

We actually broke up.

DOMINIC

No way. You guys were together for like

ten years.

BETH

Seven.   But yes, a long time.

DOMINIC

Too bad cousins can't marry, huh?    Cuz

then we could maybe --

BETH

Eeew Dominic, gross.

81

ALEX

I had no idea it would be such a

madhouse.

GIGI

Hey.   Great party.

ALEX

Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need

me to evaluate their level of interest?

GIGI

They were gay. Even I know that their

level of interest was probably low.

ALEX

Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I

still think you guys would hit it off.

GIGI

Oh OK.  Right.

(air quotes)

"Bill".

ALEX

Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some

more liquor. But it looks like the food

could use some refreshing --

ALEX (CONT'D)

Would you mind helping? I mean, just

refill the chips and stuff?

GIGI

You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?

82

ALEX

Uhh, OK.   The chips are on top of the

fridge.

PARTY-GOER #1

Really great party.

GIGI

Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have

a party, I was like "Let's do it."

PARTY-GOER #2

Thanks so much for having us.

GIGI

No problem.   Anytime.

GIGI (CONT'D)

Can I help you find something?

TALL GIRL

No, that's OK. I got it.

TALL GIRL (CONT'D)

Thanks for mixing that up.

83

GIGI

What?

TALL GIRL

Alex asked me to get the dip together.

Thanks for getting it started.

TALL GIRL (CONT'D)

Hmmm - could use a little more dill.

GIGI

When someone's underwear ends up in your

toaster oven - it's been a good party.

ALEX

I guess people had fun.

TALL GIRL

Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?

GIGI

That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd

stick around, so I'll take care of it.

TALL GIRL

No.   I got it.

ALEX

Knock yourselves out.

84

GIGI

I think I've rounded up the last of the

beer bottles.

GIGI (CONT'D)

So, umm - what game is this?

GIGI (CONT'D)

Well, maybe I should just -- you know --

I mean it's past three and --

TALL GIRL

YES!!    Suck it!

ALEX

You are sensational.

TALL GIRL

Did you say it's past three?     Man, I

gotta go.

ALEX

Thanks for staying and helping clean up

- but I really gotta get to bed.

GIGI

Is that an invitation?

ALEX

What?

GIGI

I'm sorry. That was cheesy.      I'm not

good at this.

85

GIGI (CONT'D)

Yes!

GIGI (CONT'D)

I knew it. I knew it. The best

relationships grow out of friendships.

ALEX

Wait - what?

GIGI

Ummmm....

ALEX

Now you and I are in a relationship?

GIGI

Well, I'd say if we're not at

relationship station--ship, we're at

least on the track.

ALEX

And why would you think that, exactly?

GIGI

Because there were - you know - signs.

ALEX

Really?   Like what?

GIGI

Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You

talked to me even when you were with a

girl. I felt something...

ALEX

What are you talking about? What have I

been saying since I met you? If a guy

wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

HE WILL ASK YOU OUT. DID I ASK YOU OUT?

86

GIGI

(SOFTLY)

No.

ALEX

Why would you do this?

GIGI

I thought you were Watts.

ALEX

Why do women do this? Why do they build

this stuff up in their minds, take each

little thing a guy does and twist it into

something else --

GIGI

I'd rather be like that - than like you.

ALEX

Excuse me?

GIGI

Maybe I dissect each little thing, and

put myself out there too much, and maybe

I even thrive on the drama of it all--

but at least that means I still care.

You think you've won because women are

expendable to you? Sure, you don't get

hurt or make an ass of yourself that way,

but you don't fall in love that way,

either. You haven't won, Alex. You're

alone.

GIGI (CONT'D)

I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I

know I'm a lot closer to finding someone

than you are.

87

GIGI

Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I

just - don't start picking out your

bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn't

the first time this has happened, it's

just - this one wasn't about whether he

liked me. I just really liked him.

BETH

You want anything else?

KEN

Yeah. Less of that cardboardy brown

stuff. More regular people food.

BETH

The cardboardy brown stuff is called

whole grain bread.

KEN

Maybe you could just fry me up a couple

sausage links?

BETH

People who have just had heart attacks

generally are not advised to eat animal

fat, stuffed in synthetic casings.

KEN

Did I tell you that you're not only my

favorite daughter, but you're also the

prettiest? So much better looking than

those other dogs. Seriously.

BETH

It's not gonna work this time.   But I

appreciate the effort.

88

STEVEN

Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you're

going that way?

STEVEN (CONT'D)

And a little plate of cold cuts if there

are any left?

BETH

You might wanna kill the volume just a

smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap.

DEVON

You think your dad really wants to hang

on to all this vinyl? My collection

could use a bunch of these.

BETH

Turn it the fuck down.

BETH

I finally got mom to lay down in the

spare room. All we have left to eat is

some old jelly and ramen noodles, so

after I tackle some of these dishes,

maybe we can go to the store. Our new

brother is trying to co-opt dad's

property before he's even dead.

(MORE)

89

BETH (CONT'D)

And Laura, your husband would really like

a beer to go with his fifth consecutive

hour of the golf channel.

BETH (CONT'D)

It's OK.     It's all gonna be OK.

CATHERINE

What am I gonna do without dad?

BETH

First of all, he's upstairs watching

'Oprah After The Show'.

LAURA

And second of all - you have us.

CATHERINE

But he's always been - the one who's

there for me.

BETH

What about your husband?    Where the hell

is he?

CATHERINE

Playing ultimate frisbee.    His team may

make the quarterfinals.

GIGI

Do you know who it is?

JANINE

(shaking her head "no")

It doesn't matter.

GIGI

So are you going to - leave - him?

JANINE

Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just

some guy that didn't call me back. And

he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to

get caught. That takes courage.

90

JANINE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.     I know

Alex was not just some guy.

GIGI

It's OK.

JANINE

It's my fault, you know.

GIGI

What?

JANINE

I'm willing to accept my responsibility

in this. I forced him into getting

married. He wasn't ready.

GIGI

Janine - this is not your fault.

JANINE

It is.  I've - changed. I used to be

fun. I was fun when we met.

GIGI

You're still fun.

JANINE

We never have sex anymore.

GIGI

Lots of couples got through lulls.

JANINE

No. We never have sex. Realistically,

what did I expect him to do?

GIGI

I don't think that's really --

JANINE

This is too small. I gotta tell Javier.

GIGI

What?

91

JANINE

This tile. I gotta go.    Tell Beth I took

a personal day.

MARIEL

My first husband was unimpressive. I

found him in bed with his big breasted

secretary when I came home early from the

Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel

sorry for him. My second husband was a

pinch more creative. Cheated on me with

my sister - but made me believe that I

was insane for being suspicious. At last

- some intrigue, some mind games - though

my sister's two year old eventually gave

them up. But my last husband -- he was a

gem. A veritable master at covering his

tracks. I poured over his phone records,

intercepted his credit card bills, had

him followed on countless occasions - and

never found a single shred of evidence.

It wasn't until he died that I found out

about the property he owned with his

Austrian mistress. But the real master,

I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --

countless boyfriends, and I haven't been

caught yet.

ANNA

Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

BEN

It was all you, babe.

ANNA

Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

92

ANNA

OH.    MY.   GOD.

BEN

This is really good news.

ANNA

I cannot believe this. He liked my demo.

Did you hear what he said? When he said

it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you

hear that part?

BEN

Yep.    I was sitting right there.

ANNA

Thank you.     Thank you so much.

BEN

How is it that every time I see your

body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?

BEN (CONT'D)

Dana, I need to go over the offering

statement. Can I get a few minutes?

JANINE (O.S.)

It's not Dana.

ANNA

Is -

93

BEN

Shit. I told Dana to get this lock

fixed. One sec.

JANINE

Why do you even lock it?

BEN

I'd never get anything done if I didn't.

JANINE

Can I come in?

BEN

Of course.

BEN (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

JANINE

Sit down.

BEN

OK.

BEN (CONT'D)

Janine, what are you doing?

JANINE

I don't know. I just thought - maybe we

could, you know, relight the fire.

94

BEN

Honey, did you hear what I just said? I

gotta get this offering statement out.

JANINE

Look, I am trying here. Do you want to

save our marriage or don't you?

BEN (O.S.)

Of course I do.

JANINE (O.S.)

Then you'll let me do this.

JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Yeah, just like that, yeah...

ALEX

OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and

pitch in with the servers when you -

TYRONE

No...I'm on 8 thru 10. I'm always on 8

through 10. Been working here 18 months

doing 8 through 10.

ALEX

Right.   Luis you take 4 through 6.

TYRONE

Dude.    Luis quit like 10 months ago.

95

ALEX

Do we even need to have this meeting?

Seriously? Does this serve any purpose?

ALEX (CONT'D)

Good.   Great. Get to work.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?

KELLI ANN

Since you asked me 11 minutes ago?   No,

not a lot of phone traffic.

KELLI ANN (CONT'D)

Oh my god.

ALEX

What?

KELLI ANN

It's happened to you.

ALEX

What has happened to me?

KELLI ANN

What's her name?

ALEX

Who?

KELLI ANN

The girl, Alex.

ALEX

There's no girl.

96

KELLI ANN

You can't hide it man. I know strung out

and you are strung - out.

ALEX

Please -

KELLI ANN

This is amazing. Can't focus, right?

Jumping every time your phone rings,

checking your email 100 times a day.

Wishing you could write songs. Feeling

the need to bring up her name in random

conversations...

KELLI ANN (CONT'D)

It's always the same. And it has

happened to you, my friend. Trust me.

ALEX

Shit.

KELLI ANN

Welcome to my world asshole.

JANINE

You sure I can't interest you in a little

beef and broccoli? I'm treating.

BEN

I really gotta get this stuff done.

JANINE

OK.   I'll see you at home.     I love you.

97

BEN

(covering his anger)

I love you too.

BEN (CONT'D)

I had no choice. What was I supposed to

do when she -

ANNA

You make me sick to my stomach.    You are

a disgusting excuse for a man -

BEN

I didn't want to do it, Anna. You know

that it's you I want to be with -

ANNA

Are you kidding me? You will never lay a

hand on me again. I may just be a piss

poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym

- but I am so too good for you.

GIGI

Dino, thank you again for letting me pay

over the phone. I assure you this late

payment thing will never happen again.

Yep -- just trying to trim some of the

drama out of my life.

GIGI (CONT'D)

That's my other line.   OK.     B-bye.

GIGI (CONT'D)

Hello?

98

MANS' VOICE

Hi, Gigi.    This is Bill.

GIGI

Ummm -

BILL

Alex's friend. We were supposed to meet

up - but Alex told me the wrong day.

GIGI

Bill.    So you do exist.

BILL

I do. And I'd love to buy you dinner

sometime if you're game.

GIGI

Yes.    Sure.   Why not?

ANNA

I'm gonna go. I left the check on the

counter. It should at least get you

through this month.

MAYA

Thanks sweetie. I don't know what I

would do without you.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Baby - what's the matter?

99

MAYA (CONT'D)

Is it money? Because you can take back

the check if -

ANNA

No, it's not that. I mean - yes, I'm

broke - but it's not that. It's just -

(tearing up again)

I'm just so lost mom. I've been seeing

this guy - who is exciting and amazing

and thoroughly unavailable. I thought he

was - the one - but he turned out to be

such an asshole.

Maya nods, almost smiling.

ANNA (CONT'D)

And then there's -

MAYA

Conor -

ANNA

Yeah. Who I'm so horrible to. But he

takes it. And he's - there. Waiting.

But I just don't want to - I don't know -

MAYA

Settle?   Like you think I did?

Anna looks at her mother, guilty.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Well, your father and I had a glorious

life together.

ANNA

Are you kidding? All you talk about are

the things you didn't do, the people you

wish you could have been with, the Tim

Buckleys - anything but the life you

actually had.

Maya looks at her daughter.

MAYA

Those are just dreams Anna.

Anna tries to process this.

MAYA (CONT'D)

Now true - I did not like your father at

all when we met.

(MORE)

100

MAYA (CONT'D)

Or after we got married for that matter.

But let me tell you this - life with him

was a hell of a lot better than life is

without him.

Maya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen.

MAYA (CONT'D)

There are worse things in life than

settling.

ANNA

Like what?

MAYA

Like wishing you had.

Anna considers this.

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Anna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling.

The doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it. Almost as

soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the

middle of her studio apartment. He is all amped up.

ANNA

Hey, sweetie.

She reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it.

CONOR

See, why did you call me sweetie?

Anna looks confused.

ANNA

Because we always call each other that.

CONOR

Why?

Anna doesn't have an answer for that.

CONOR (CONT'D)

I want to say something, OK? I mean, we

call each other sweetie, and we fall

asleep on the phone after talking for

hours and I washed your hair for you

after you had that shoulder surgery and

everything - it's like we're together.

101

ANNA

I know that I -

CONOR

Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault.

Maybe I haven't been clear about what I

want. So let me be clear. I love

hanging out, but I am so attracted to

you, and I just - I want both. I want to

make love to you. I know that sounds

kind of embarrassing coming out of my

mouth - I just freaked myself out, too -

but it's true. And I'm not sure what

happened, or why we stopped - but I don't

really care. I just --

ANNA

OK.

Conor is STUNNED.

CONOR

What?

ANNA

OK.

CONOR

I'm talking about really doing this.

Like a full-on relationship.

ANNA

Right.

CONOR

With me.

She LAUGHS.

ANNA

Yes.

CONOR

Did a bunch of gay people put you up to

this?

ANNA

Please stop talking.

He does.   They KISS.

102

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

Conor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around

Anna. Anna lays on her back, eyes wide open, STARING AT

THE CEILING. She's clearly not at peace.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - DAY

All of Beth's sister's spouses - Steven, Devon and George

- sit on the couch watching basketball.

DEVON

Shit!    Take him out.   He's done.

GEORGE

Jesus.   This isn't some exhibition game.

Beth comes downstairs, with another set of dirty dishes,

and walks past them to the kitchen. The guys are annoyed

that she blocks their view.

STEVEN

Could you --

BETH

Did anyone have time to run to the store?

GEORGE

Nah, we're good. We just got drive

through.

BETH

I didn't mean for you.

Beth, annoyed, goes into the kitchen. She puts down the

dishes in shock. The kitchen is SPOTLESS.

She looks to the sink and sees the back of a man, doing

the last of the dishes. He turns around. It's NEIL.

NEIL

The dishes are all put away. There's a

load of laundry still drying, but the

other one is folded on top of the washer.

He goes to the fridge, and OPENS it.    It's STOCKED.

NEIL (CONT'D)

I remembered what your dad likes, but I

tried to get healthy stuff, too.

Beth just looks at Neil, stunned.

103

NEIL (CONT'D)

Ben told me.    I just - I wanted to help.

With that, TEARS start to roll out of Beth's eyes.         Neil

goes to her, and puts his arms around her.

NEIL (CONT'D)

I know how much you love him.      But it's

gonna be OK.

EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Janine pulls up in her Land Rover and gets out. As she

approaches the house, she stops in her tracks. ALL THE

SCAFFOLDING IS GONE. THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. She

whips out her cell phone and dials.

JANINE

Javier - does this mean what I think it

means? So when you say "done" - you

don't mean "we still need plumbing in the

upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done

done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll

call when I see it...Bye.

She hangs up the phone, steels herself, and walks inside.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME

As Janine enters - she can't believe her eyes.

VARIOUS SHOTS as Janine walks from room to room - amazed.

Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls

with vintage wall paper. All the floors are immaculate,

the chandeliers sparkle - it's all perfect.

She walks down halls and up staircases, past end tables

and mantles - ALL COVERED WITH PICTURES OF HER AND BEN.

Nice and tasteful.

She ends her tour in the master suite - it's HUGE. And

though full of furniture, the longer she stands there,

the more empty it begins to seem. Her face transitions,

from delight to loneliness, within a matter of seconds.

She takes out her cell phone, hesitates, then dials...

EXT. MEADOW MILL ATHLETIC CLUB - SAME

CLOSE ON:   A LIT CIGARETTE.       A LONG DRAG IS TAKEN.

104

CUT WIDE TO REVEAL: Ben sitting on a ledge in front of

the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby.

He's clearly waiting for Anna to arrive.

His PHONE RINGS. He looks at it - JANINE CALLING. He

IGNORES the call, takes another drag of his cigarette.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

With Janine as the call goes to voice mail. She hangs

up, confused. She sits on the edge of the bed, looking

around the room, not sure what to do with herself.

She notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a

chair - goes to tidy it up. She picks up the jacket,

checks the pockets, they're empty. She grabs the pants,

takes them both to the walk-in closet. She hangs up the

jacket. And as she folds the pants over - she HEARS

SOMETHING HIT THE GROUND. She looks down to find -

A PACK OF CIGARETTES. Her face pales. She stares at it -

immobile. Her face tightens, her eyes well up.

JANINE

YOU LYING SACK OF SHIT!

- as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks

and flies out of the closet.

STAIRCASE - She hurtles down the stairs, throwing armfuls

of clothes into the foyer. Then, she surveys the scene

and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs.

HALLWAY - As she flies back into the bedroom, she sees

herself in the ANTIQUE MIRROR hanging in the hallway.

Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and

SMASHES IT on the ground. She stands over it, breathing

heavily, looking at the shattered glass.

She EXITS FRAME and we hear her walk down the stairs, the

camera HOLDING ON THE EMPTY WALL.

After a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs - she

ENTERS FRAME AGAIN holding a DUSTPAN AND BROOM. She

kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess.

INT. BOAT - DAY

Neil lies on the bed, reading. The room is pretty messy -

a lot of clothes strewn around. There is a KNOCK at the

door. Neil gets up to answer it. It's Beth.

105

NEIL

Hey.

BETH

It's been a while since I've been here.

Turns out - that boat in the next

mooring, looks like yours -- not yours.

NEIL

Oh no.

BETH

No, it's no problem. Nice guy. Invited

me in for a white wine spritzer. Not

sure he gets a lot of visitors.

Neil laughs.

BETH (CONT'D)

Can I come in?

Neil ushers her in, shuts the door.    Beth looks around.

BETH (CONT'D)

I wanted to thank you. For coming by my

folks' house.

NEIL

Of course. I really care about your dad.

And I really love you. Even if I can't

give you what you want.

BETH

You're what I want.

Neil looks at her - unsure of her meaning.

BETH (CONT'D)

Our life together is what I want. Your

love is what I want. Did you see those

guys my sisters are married to? You are

a better husband to me - without being

married - than any of those real husbands

will ever be. And that's enough for me.

NEIL

And you'd really be OK if we take the

marriage thing off the table?

BETH

If you promise to love me and be

committed to me -

106

NEIL

I always have -

BETH

Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower

drain when my hair clogs it, and let me

eat Wheat Thins in bed.

NEIL

I do.

Beth smiles.   They KISS.

NEIL (CONT'D)

So, I get to move back in?

BETH

I guess.   But, you cannot bring those.

She points to his pants - a RAGGEDY pair of CARGO PANTS.

NEIL

What? You're just mad at me, and you're

taking it out on the pants.

BETH

Look, I gotta win something. I let you

win the big battle, so throw me a bone.

NEIL

OK. We're not getting married, but I'm

chucking the pants.

BETH

Great.   We both win.

They kiss AGAIN.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

Gigi sits on her bed, head flung upside down, blow drying

her hair. The phone RINGS but Gigi doesn't hear it.

INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME

Alex, in his office, paces as he talks into the phone.

ALEX

Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just

wondering how you were doing. It's been

a little while since we've talked -- and

I was wondering how you were doing.

107

Alex looks up. Tyrone is watching him, shaking his head.

Alex motions for Tyrone to leave. He doesn't.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you.

Obviously. But you're out. So, call me.

Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK.

That's enough now. It's Alex.

He hangs up.   Tyrone is unimpressed.

TYRONE

Dude.

ALEX

I know.   I know.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - SAME

Gigi flips her head back - oblivious to the phone call -

and checks her hair. She heads out of the bedroom.

EXT. ROWHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row

house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside.

ANNA

You seriously get a ton of people bidding

on this?

CONOR

I know it's crazy. But it's a

neighborhood "in transition."

ANNA

So that means what - that hip gay people

want to live out here?

CONOR

Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples,

young families.

Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house.

INT. ROWHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

ANNA

Weird - it totally reminds me of the

house I grew up in. I bet there is a -

Anna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen.   And

pulls down a BUILT IN IRONING BOARD.

108

ANNA (CONT'D)

We totally had this same thing. My mom

would use this as her 'desk'. Isn't that

bizarre? It was always covered with her

little coupons and stuff.

Anna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her.

ANNA (CONT'D)

So, when do all the fabulous homosexual

couples start arriving?

CONOR

Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I

have this one buyer. I mean, I want to

see if his girlfriend likes it first -

ANNA

His girlfriend?

CONOR

I mean, I had this idea -

Conor looks - all of a sudden - to be sweating.

ANNA

An idea for the open house?

CONOR

No, an idea. For this house. For - me.

To buy. And hopefully, if you like it

and things continue to - you know...

Anna turns to face Conor, trying to put this together.

CONOR (CONT'D)

Anna, look. I have a plan. I know where

my life is going. And I want you to go

with me. I mean - I'm not saying you

have to move in now or anything - I just -

I don't want to buy a place that you

couldn't - at some point - see yourself

moving into.

Conor takes her hands in his.   Anna starts to PANIC.

CONOR (CONT'D)

So what do you think? I mean gut

reaction. I always go with my gut when

it comes to real estate or ---

109

Anna looks at him. And at the PULL DOWN IRONING BOARD.

She looks at the ironing board a long time, before

turning back to Conor, holding back tears.

ANNA

I can't do this Conor.

CONOR

OK.   If it's too fast -

ANNA

No. I mean this. Any of this. What

you're saying - what you're offering - is

what every girl wants. It's what I've

always wanted. It's just -

Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say

this. Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees

it in her face. The answer he's been looking for. It

all dawns on him in an instant.

CONOR

You don't want it with me.

Anna NODS sadly.   Conor takes this in.   A LONG BEAT.

CONOR (CONT'D)

So, I have a question.

ANNA

Okay.

CONOR

Is it too late to dial it back to before -

and just keep sleeping together?

Anna LAUGHS, and it breaks the tension.   Conor smiles.

CONOR (CONT'D)

Because I thought that really -    you know

- gelled.

Anna goes to Conor and HUGS him.

EXT. PHILLIPS - NIGHT

Your standard waterfront seafood restaurant. Gigi sits

across from BILL, nice looking, if a bit conservative.

GIGI

So, Alex told me you work in finance.

110

BILL

Yes.   Yes, I do. Finance.

A LONG PAUSE.

GIGI

This is nice.

BILL

It is.

GIGI

A nice evening. And you planned it. And

called me when you said you would. And

showed up on time. Thank you, Bill.

BILL

You're very welcome.

ANOTHER AWKWARD LONG SILENCE.    Gigi smiles.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alex now seems pretty agitated. He's shirtless, his

hair's a disaster. He's holding his phone handset.

Staring at it. He can't stop himself. He dials.

GIGI (V.O.)

Hey it's Gigi. You've reached my cell.

I'm either having a very good time or in

a meeting - either way just leave a

message and --

Alex hangs up. He stands there for a second, thinking.

Then he runs into his bedroom like a madman.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Gigi and Bill stand awkwardly outside her door.

GIGI

It was nice meeting you.

BILL

Thank you for a lovely evening.

GIGI

You, too.

Bill reaches out for an ill timed hug.   It's awkward.

GIGI (CONT'D)

Goodnight.

111

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She comes inside, drops her stuff and sits on the couch.

Then, A KNOCK on the door. Gigi reluctantly gets up.

GIGI

Did you forget something?

She opens the DOOR.    It's not Bill.   It's ALEX.

ALEX

Yeah.   I did.

GIGI

Really?     What did you forget?

ALEX

This.

Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE

SAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR.

Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE.

FADE OUT.

INT. THE OWL BAR - NIGHT

A speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A

PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then -

a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front

of the mic. And begins to SING.

It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely

recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she

begins to gain confidence. We hear the song over:

INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - DAY

Beth and Neil's place. Neil comes in holding a few

MESSILY PACKED BOXES. He is clearly moving back in.

NEIL

How did all this stuff fit in here fine

before?

Beth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes.

BETH

I don't know. It expanded.

Neil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a

pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs.

112

BETH (CONT'D)

No you are not trying to bring these back

in here -

Beth holds the CARGO PANTS that she protested before.

NEIL

What?    I have no idea what you're -

BETH

We had a deal. These are not staying.

NEIL

That's really gonna free up a lot of

space.

BETH

They're going. I have a bag I'm taking

to the Goodwill.

Neil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room.

NEIL

Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make

sure there's nothing in the pockets

before we give them away.

Beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then

she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she

pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it,

and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE.

NEIL (CONT'D)

I love you so much. So much. I want to

make you happy. I need to make you happy

for me to even have a shot at being

happy, too.

Tears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the box,

revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING.

NEIL (CONT'D)

Will you marry me?

Neil gets up and KISSES HER. They kiss, passionately,

for a long moment. And then:

BETH

Yes.    Of course, yes.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Gigi and Alex stand in her entry.     She holds the PEN.

113

GIGI

You came all the way here - at 11 at

night - to give me back a promotional

pen?

ALEX

I thought I better come up with some

excuse to get over here. Isn't that how

it's done?

GIGI

Sometimes.

Alex looks at Gigi for a long moment.    He looks nervous.

ALEX

Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I

drive by your place. I call and hang up.

I'm turning into -

GIGI

Me.

He LAUGHS.

ALEX

Yeah.

GIGI

Well, a wise person once told me that if

a guy wants to be with a girl, he will

make it happen. No matter what.

ALEX

True.

GIGI

Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body

onto yours - you did not seem to want to

"make it happen."

ALEX

Here's the thing about that. You were

right. I've gotten so used to keeping

myself at a safe distance from these

women, having the power - that I didn't

know what it felt like when I actually -

fell - for one of them.

Gigi considers this.

114

GIGI

Look, I've just been out with your friend

Bill. And it just might be exactly what

I need. No drama. He calls. He does

what he says.

ALEX

I could do that stuff too.

GIGI

But you didn't. And that same wise

person told me that I am the rule. That

I have to stop thinking that every guy

will change - stop thinking that I will

be the --

But before she can finish her sentence, Alex KISSES HER.

A LONG, SLOW, PASSIONATE KISS.

GIGI (CONT'D)

- that I will be the exception.

Alex looks at her.

ALEX

You are my exception.

They continue to KISS.

EXT. GAY PRIDE PARADE - NIGHT

A staple of summer in Baltimore.

The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very

phallic "blade" with a A BUNCH OF YOUNG SHIRTLESS MEN

dancing and waving. Mary rides the float, too, waving to

the crowd with Nathan, Joshua and Bruce.

Conor, with a NATTILY DRESSED GAY COUPLE, stands on the

street watching. Nathan calls down from the float.

NATHAN

Jonathan?

NATTILY DRESSED GAY

What are you guys doing up there?

NATHAN

Dancing.    Get your asses up here.

With that, the two Nattily Dressed Gays grab Conor, and

climb up onto the float. They SHOUT over the music.

115

NATTILY DRESSED GAY

This is Conor. He just sold us on the

most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.

MARY

Hey, Conor.    I'm Mary.

Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men

around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.

MARY (CONT'D)

It's so great to finally meet you in

person.

CONOR

You, too.

They look at each other.   Is there a connection?

CONOR (CONT'D)

Would you like to dance?

MARY

I'd love to.

Conor takes her hand - and the two of them do an old

fashioned slow dance on the float. As everyone freaks

around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.

EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - NIGHT

Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.

As he heads to the stairs, he stops in his tracks. At

the bottom of the stairs - ALL OF HIS CLOTHES are

stacked, neatly folded into piles. He approaches, then

sees a CARTON OF CIGARETTES on top of one pile -

BEN

Shit...

- and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF

OUT. - JANINE P.S. I WANT A DIVORCE.

Ben slumps down, devastated.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HARBOR - DAY

A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades

out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.

116

GIGI (V.O.)

Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing

up. If a guy punches you, he likes you.

Never try to trim your own bangs.

EXT. BOAT - DAY

Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get

closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even

closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He

escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat -

is a TINY WEDDING. About six guests. And Neil, waiting

for Beth at the altar.

GIGI (V.O.)

And someday you will meet a wonderful guy

and get your very own happy ending.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary sits at her desk, typing on her laptop.   ON THE

SCREEN: MARY'S MYSPACE PROFILE.

GIGI (V.O.)

Every movie we see, every story we're

told, implores us to wait for it. The

third act twist...the man who couldn't

get it together finally figuring it

out...the unexpected declaration of

love...

Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE

YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS MYSPACE PROFILE? Mary

clicks "YES". MYSPACE PROFILE DELETED appears.

Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her

little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary

smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY

Gigi and Alex sit close on her couch, watching a movie.

GIGI (V.O.)

...the exception to the rule.

We PAN over to the TV to find that they are watching:

SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Watts and Keith finally KISS.

Gigi can't suppress her smile as Alex pulls her close.

GIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

What we're not taught is how to read the

signs.

117

INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - DAY

Ben heads to the checkout line - holding a six pack of

beer and a bag of chips. As he's about to put his stuff

down, a PRETTY GIRL gets in line behind him.

GIGI (V.O.)

How to tell the ones who want us from the

ones who don't. The one's who'll stay

from the one's who'll leave.

He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on

it. The cashier rings her up, she pays for her stuff,

without giving Ben so much as a look. Ben gives his

stuff to the cashier, along with a weak smile.

EXT. BUTCHER'S HILL BROWNSTONE - EVENING

From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we

can see the living room of the lower apartment. Boxes

fill the room - clearly a new tenant moving in.

Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and

pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).

GIGI (V.O.)

And ultimately, we're not taught the one

thing that could save ourselves, our

friends, our families countless hours of

confusion, despair, and speculation.

She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She

steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk

two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.

We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear

it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an

awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -

NEW GUY

It was nice meeting you.

Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna

watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.

GIGI (V.O.)

That sometimes the happy ending...is just

moving on.

Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in

front of her.

THE END
