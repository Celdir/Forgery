BOUND

Larry & Andy Wachowski

VIOLET (V.O.)

I had this image of you, inside of

me, like a part of me.

CORKY (V.O.)

You planned this whole thing, didn't

you?

CAESAR (V.O.)

Where's the fucking money?

VIOLET (V.O.)

We make our own choices, we pay our

own prices.

CAESAR (V.O.)

All part of the business.

VIOLET (V.O.)

All part of the business.

CORKY (V.O.)

What choice?

VIOLET (V.O.)

I want out.

VIOLET (V.O.)

Like a part of me.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

Wait!  Hold the elevator.

CORKY

Thanks again for this opportunity,

Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.

DISSOLVING INTO:

VIOLET

Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of

met in the elevator --

CORKY

Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.

VIOLET

I heard you working in here and I

just wondered if you'd like a cup of

coffee?

CORKY

Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.

VIOLET

What happened to Rajeev?

CORKY

Who?

VIOLET

Rajeev, the man who usually works on

the building.

CORKY

Oh, he went home to India, but as

far as I know he'll be back.

VIOLET

So this is temporary for you?

CORKY

Pretty much.  One day at a time.

VIOLET

I guessed you were straight black.

CORKY

Good guess.

CORKY

Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.

VIOLET

My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I

did have a slightly ulterior motive

here.  I was wondering if I could

ask a small favor?

CORKY

A favor?

VIOLET

Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person,

so I was wondering if it wasn't a

terrible inconvenience if you could

wait a bit before using power tools.

CORKY

Oh, I'm sorry --

VIOLET

No, it isn't your fault.  The walls

here are just so thin.

CORKY

Are they really?

VIOLET

Yes, it really causes problems.

Sometimes it's like you're in the

same room.  But if it's too much

trouble, I understand ...

CORKY

No, no trouble.  There's other work

to do.

VIOLET

You're doing everything yourself?

CORKY

Yeah.

VIOLET

That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of

people who can fix things.  My dad

was like that.  We never had anything

new.  Whenever something broke he

would open it up, tinker with it and

it would work.  His hands were magic.

VIOLET

Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty

years old.

CORKY

Truck.

VIOLET

Truck.  Of course.

CORKY

'63 Chevy.

VIOLET

I knew it.

VIOLET

So, how do you know the owner, Mr.

Bianchinni?

CORKY

I don't, really.  I was referred to

him.

VIOLET

Oh, really.

CORKY

Do you know him?

VIOLET

No, but Caesar does.  He likes him.

Says he's a good Italian.

CORKY

Caesar is your husband?

VIOLET

Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying

kind.

VIOLET

I should be going.  You can drop the

cup off anytime.

CORKY

Thanks.

VIOLET

My pleasure.

BARTENDER

Well, well ...

BARTENDER

Been awhile, Cork.

CORKY

Five years, two months, sixteen days.

How you doing, Sue?

SUE

Like shit.  Now that we're all caught

up, how about a drink?

CORKY

Thanks.

SUE

You got a job yet?

CORKY

Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and

shit.

SUE

I mean a J-O-B.  A real job.

CORKY

Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and

narrow.  I'm just here to get laid

or drunk and hopefully both.

CORKY

Thanks for the beer.

CORKY

Hi.

WOMAN

Hello.

CORKY

You know ...  that outfit would look

great on my bedroom floor.

WOMAN COP

Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here?

CORKY

Nothing ...  yet.

WOMAN COP

Who's this?

WOMAN COP

Wait, I know you.

CORKY

I don't think so.

WOMAN COP

I didn't know you were out.

CORKY

When you get tired of Cagney and

Lacey, come find me.

CORKY

Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...

yes, everything is going fine.  I

got the tub drain all cleaned out.

CORKY

What apartment?

CORKY

All right, all right, I guess I could

take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome,

goodbye.

VIOLET

Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would

call you.  God, you must think |I'm

a total nuisance.

CORKY

Not exactly.

VIOLET

I'm sorry, I usually would call

Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do

so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

CORKY

He said you lost something.

VIOLET

Yeah, come on in.

VIOLET

I was doing some dishes and just as

I pulled the stopper my earring fell

in.

VIOLET

It's one of my favorites.  That's

why I got upset.  I know it probably

seems ridiculous to you.

VIOLET

I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I

shouldn't have called...

CORKY

I told Bianchinni I would take a

look.  Is it that sink?

CORKY

Do you have a pot or a bucket?

VIOLET

Sure.

VIOLET

Did you find it?

VIOLET

I can't believe it!  You did it!

VIOLET

Thank you so much.  You have to let

me pay you something --

CORKY

No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do

it.  I did it.

VIOLET

If you won't take money, how about a

drink?  It's getting late.  You can't

work all night.

CORKY

Okay, one drink.

VIOLET

What do you want?

CORKY

A beer?

VIOLET

A beer.  Of course.

VIOLET

Sit down.

VIOLET

Thanks again.

VIOLET

You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make

you nervous, Corky?

CORKY

No.

VIOLET

Thirsty, maybe.

CORKY

Curious, maybe.

VIOLET

Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling

a bit curious myself right now.

VIOLET

That's a great tattoo.

VIOLET

Beautiful labrys.

VIOLET

Are you surprised that I know what

it is?

CORKY

Maybe.

VIOLET

I have a tattoo, would you like to

see it?

VIOLET

A woman in upstate New York did it

for me.

VIOLET

Here.  Do you like it?

VIOLET

It took her all day to do it.  She

promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it

was sore for a long time after.  I

couldn't even touch it.

VIOLET

But now I love the way it feels.

VIOLET

Here, touch it.

CORKY

What are you doing?

VIOLET

Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to

seduce you.

CORKY

Why?

VIOLET

Because I want to.  I've wanted to

since I first saw you in the elevator.

VIOLET

You don't believe me.  But I can

prove it to you.

VIOLET

You can't believe me because of what

you see ...

VIOLET

But you can believe what you feel.

VIOLET

You see ...  I've been thinking about

you all day.

CORKY

You planned this whole thing?

CORKY

You dropped that earring down the

drain on purpose, didn't you?

VIOLET

If I say yes, will you take your

hand away?

CORKY

No.

VIOLET

...  yes.

VIOLET

Please, Corky ...  please ...

VIOLET

...  kiss me.

CAESAR

Violet?

CAESAR

Violet, you home?

VIOLET

Yeah.  In here, C.

CAESAR

What's this?

CAESAR

What the fuck is this?

VIOLET

I didn't expect --

CAESAR

What the fuck is going on?

CAESAR

Oh, shit ...

VIOLET

Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.

CAESAR

I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...

it's fucking dark in here.

VIOLET

She is working for Bianchinni.

CAESAR

Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned

that to me.  Hi, welcome to the

family.

CAESAR

You're helping Rajeev?

CORKY

No.  Rajeev's in India.

VIOLET

She's doing the work herself.

CAESAR

No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You

know he's a good friend of mine.

|Family, really.

CORKY

That's what Violet said.

CAESAR

So, you just got out?

VIOLET

Jesus, Caesar!

CAESAR

What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal.

I know who Don hires.  Did you know

he did time himself?

CAESAR

Thirteen fucking years.  See, there

ain't no secrets here.

CAESAR

How many'd you do?

CORKY

Five.

CAESAR

Not bad.  What for?

VIOLET

That's none of your goddamn business,

Caesar.

CAESAR

You're right.  You don't have to

tell me, if you don't want to.  I

just hope you understand you're among

good people here.

CAESAR

Come on, come on.  if you understand

what I'm talking about you're going

to take the money.  if you don't,

I'm going to have to worry about

you.

CAESAR

Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.

CORKY

I should be going.

CAESAR

What?  How about a drink?

CORKY

My brushes, I have to clean my

brushes.  Thanks, though.

CAESAR

Another time.

CORKY

Sure.

CORKY

What are you doing?

CORKY

What am I doing?  I'm fucking up,

that's what I'm doing.

VIOLET

I had to see you.

CORKY

Look, I don't think this is a good

idea.

VIOLET

I wanted to apologize.

CORKY

Don't apologize, please.  I can't

stand women who apologize for wanting

sex.

VIOLET

I'm not apologizing for what I did --

VIOLET

I'm apologizing for what I didn't

do.

VIOLET

Do you have a bed somewhere?

CORKY

I can see again.

VIOLET

...  I needed that.

CORKY

Tell me about it.

CORKY

Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?

VIOLET

You have to ask?

CORKY

No.

VIOLET

Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.

Caesar calls it "The |Business."

CORKY

How did you meet him?

VIOLET

They took over a club I was working

at.  Caesar started managing it.

CORKY

He's a launderer?

VIOLET

Basically.

CORKY

How long have you been with him?

VIOLET

Almost five years.

CORKY

Five years is a long time.

VIOLET

Yes, it is.

CORKY

The redistribution of wealth.

VIOLET

What?

CORKY

Isn't that what you wanted to know?

What I did time for?

VIOLET

The redistribution of wealth?

CORKY

That's what I tell someone when I'm

trying to get them in my bed.

VIOLET

I'm already in your bed.

CORKY

My cellmate would say she did her

time for getting caught.  She was

always more honest than me.

CORKY

I started stealing when I was little.

We were piss-poor, which is not an

excuse, just a fact.

CORKY

The first time I remember so vividly.

A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's

Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was

a mean old prick, always worrying

about us robbing him, dropped a roll

of quarters.

CORKY

I can still hear that sound, those

quarters, because right then something

clicked inside of me.  Some instinct

took over and as everyone, including

Waxman, dove down, I reached up and

emptied the cash register.

CORKY

I gave most of the money to my mom.

I told her I found it at the

trainyard.  She was so happy she

cried, calling me her lucky charm.

Fifteen years later, I guess my luck

ran out.

CORKY

Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't

have a choice, that stealing was

surviving.  Usually I can admit that's

bullshit.  I did it because it was a

way out.  It was easy and I was good

at it, real good.

CORKY

I don't usually talk this much.  I

guess I have been rehabilitated.

VIOLET

You didn't have to tell me if you

didn't want to.

CORKY

I guess I wanted to.

VIOLET

I'm glad you did.

CORKY

So am I.

SHELLY

I know he's gone.  Please.  I have

to talk to you.

VIOLET (V.O.)

What do you want, Shelly?

VIOLET

I had this image of you, inside of

me ...

VIOLET

Like a part of me ...

VIOLET

You are so beautiful.

VIOLET

What's wrong?

CORKY

Nothing.

VIOLET

Yes there is.  I felt it this morning

when I brought you the coffee.

CORKY

Shit, here we go.

VIOLET

You didn't want to see me, did you?

CORKY

If there is one thing I can't stand

about sleeping with women, it's all

the fucking mind reading.

VIOLET

What are you afraid of?

CORKY

I'm not afraid of anything.

VIOLET

I don't understand - ?

CORKY

I know!  You can't understand, because

we're different, Violet.  We're

different.

VIOLET

We're not that different, Corky.

CORKY

How can you sit in that bed and say

that?

VIOLET

Because it's the truth.

CORKY

Let me guess.  This is where you

tell me that what matters is on the

inside.  That inside you, there is a

little dyke just like me?

VIOLET

Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's

a lot smarter than you.

CORKY

Is that what her daddy tells her?

VIOLET

I know what I am.  I don't need to

have it tattooed on my shoulder.

CORKY

What are you saying?  That you don't

have sex with men?

VIOLET

I don't.

CORKY

For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard

you!  Thin walls, remember?

VIOLET

What you heard wasn't sex.

CORKY

What the fuck was it?

VIOLET

All my life, everyone has been telling

me that when I have sex, I'm not

really having sex.  Not real sex.

But they're wrong.  I know what is

and isn't sex and what you heard was

definitely not sex.

CORKY

What was it then?

VIOLET

Work.

VIOLET

You made certain choices in your

life that you paid for.  You said

you made them because you were good

at something and it was easy.  Do

you think you're the only one that's

good at something?

VIOLET

We make our own choices and we pay

our own prices.  I think we're more

alike than you want to admit.

CORKY

What about that guy this morning?

VIOLET

You mean Shelly?

CORKY

Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.

VIOLET

No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw

me in a bar with another woman.

CORKY

I suppose he just wants to watch.

VIOLET

Fuck it!  I think you better leave.

CORKY

I think so, too.

VIOLET

Try not to steal anything on the way

out.

CORKY

Shit.

ANGRY VOICE

Shut the fuck up!  You piece of shit!

ANGRY VOICE

You're going to tell us!  You're

going to fuckin' tell us!  just a

matter of fuckin' time!

ANGRY VOICE

Where is it?  Where the fuck is it?!

ANGRY VOICE

You shit!  You piece of shit!

MATCH CUT TO:

ANGRY VOICE

Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko:

I'm just getting started.

JOHNNIE

You got nerve trying to fuck us!

Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my

father!  Nobody!  Nobody!

CAESAR

Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making

too much noise.

JOHNNIE

You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!

CAESAR

Here, put this in his mouth.

JOHNNIE

Prick!  I can go all night!  All

night!

VIOLET

Caesar, I'm leaving.

CAESAR

What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one

of the good towels.

VIOLET

Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too

much.  I have to get out of here.

CAESAR

Why?  'Cause you know him?

CAESAR

You women are so fucking sensitive.

CAESAR

But I don't want you to go.  I like

you here.  You know this isn't easy

for me, either.

CAESAR

Now why don't you go watch some TV

or something?

MICKEY

Are you okay, Violet?

CAESAR

Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You

know how I feel about that fucking

psycho.

MICKEY

Caesar, didn't I tell you to get

something?

CAESAR

Sure, Mickey.  Sure.

MICKEY

You shouldn't have to see this.  Why

don't you get out of here?  Go for a

walk.

VIOLET

Caesar wants me to stay.

MICKEY

Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle

Caesar.  You just get out of here,

okay?

VIOLET

Thanks, Mickey.

MICKEY

Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing.

MICKEY

Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.

JOHNNIE

Prick.

MICKEY

Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten

times.  You understand?  Ten times.

MICKEY

One.  Where is our money?

CAESAR

Aw ...  Christ.

CORKY

Violet?  Are you all right?

CORKY

Come on.  Let's go.

CORKY

Excuse me.

CORKY

Draft beer and a TNT.

VIOLET

Shelly was skimming from the business.

He came to see me yesterday because

he was afraid Caesar figured it out.

He wanted to run but he wanted me to

come with him.

CORKY

Even though he knew about you?

VIOLET

Yes.

CORKY

He was in love with you, right?

VIOLET

That's what he told himself.  But it

wasn't even about me, it was about

Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.

That's how they are.  I understand

them.

VIOLET

For Shelly, taking the money was a

way to take from Caesar.  He could

have run at any time, but he didn't

because he didn't want out.

CORKY

Sounds like he wanted to get caught.

VIOLET

Maybe he did.  He would brag to me

all the time.  He was never afraid

of Caesar because he didn't know

him.  Not like I do.

VIOLET

Caesar lives for these moments.  He

tells me it's just the business, but

I know it's more than that.  He likes

it.  The violence.  I'll catch him

in the bathroom mirror touching his

scars.  He says they remind him who

he his.  They're all like that.

Except maybe Mickey.

CORKY

Mickey?

VIOLET

He's the part of the business that

the rest of them pretend to be.

|But Mickey doesn't like it like

they do.  I suppose that's why he's

good at it.

VIOLET

I used to be able to block it out.

I would tell myself that I wasn't

really there so nothing really

mattered.  But I can't do it anymore.

VIOLET

I've been making the same mistake

Shelly made.  But now I know what |I

want.

VIOLET

I want out.  I want a new life.  I

see what I've been waiting for, but

I need you, Corky.

CORKY

For what?

VIOLET

You made a choice once.  Do you think

you would make that same choice again?

CORKY

What choice?

VIOLET

If those quarters fell to the floor,

would you still reach up to that

cash register?

CORKY

Not here.

VIOLET

Caesar is going to get the money and

bring --

CORKY

How much money?

VIOLET

Shelly said it was over two million

dollars.

VIOLET

Caesar will bring it to the apartment

to count and go through |Shelly's

books to figure out how he did it.

CORKY

Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do

you have any idea what you are saying?

You are asking me to help you fuck

the mob.

CORKY

These people are serious, Violet.

If you want to know how serious, ask

Shelly.  They're worse than any cop

because they have lots of money and

no rules.  You fuck them, you've got

to do it right.

VIOLET

That's why I need your help.  You

said you were good.

CORKY

I am, but ...

CORKY

All right, let's say for the moment

that I believe everything you are

saying.

VIOLET

You think I'm lying?

CORKY

I didn't say that, but since you

did, let's say that you are.  It

would have been easy to set Shelly

up.  You could have got him killed

knowing that Caesar would bring the

money to the apartment.

CORKY

All you would need to keep yourself

clean would be someone unconnected,

someone like me.

VIOLET

Is that what you think?

CORKY

I'm just making a point.  You have

no idea what you're asking.  How

much trust two people need to do

something like this.

CORKY

For me, stealing is a lot like sex.

Two people that want the same thing

sit in a room and they talk, they

start to plan and it's like flirting,

a kind of foreplay, because the more

they talk about it, the wetter they

get.

CORKY

The difference is, I can have sex

with someone I just met, someone I

hardly know, but to steal I need to

know someone like I know myself.

VIOLET

Do you think you know me like that?

CORKY

I think ...

CORKY

We're going to find out.

CORKY

But first, I want to see this money.

VIOLET

Oh my God ...

CAESAR

Don't worry.  It ain't mine.

VIOLET

Caesar, what happened?

CAESAR

It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking-

believable!

CAESAR

Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's

ruined!

CAESAR

It started when Shelly took us to

the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato

knows his shit, he does.  Shelly

takes us right there.

CAESAR

So Shelly's down on his knees and

he's pulling out this bag of money

from a safe in the floor and I'm

staring at it like "holy fuck!" I

mean, look at it --

CAESAR

And all I can think is how the fuck

did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie

caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere,

all over the money.  We've no idea

if this is even all of it.

CAESAR

And right then I go through the roof

and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as

hard as I can.  I didn't care whose

son he was, I just wanted to hit him

again.  Knock some sense into that

dumb son of a bitch.

CAESAR

Just look at this mess I got to deal

with.

VIOLET

What are you going to do with it?

CAESAR

I told them to run it through the

cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans

for it because he's coming here

tomorrow night to pick this shit up.

CAESAR

Where the hell's the laundry

detergent?

VIOLET

Ummm ...  in the linen closet.

CORKY

Come to my place in the morning.

Early, okay?

VIOLET (V.O.)

You're having second thoughts.

CORKY

...  no.

CORKY

You said he washed the money?

VIOLET

Yeah.

CORKY

Then what?  Exactly.

VIOLET

He hung it up.

CORKY

What?

VIOLET

To let it dry.

VIOLET

It was unreal ...

MATCH CUT TO:

VIOLET (V.O.)

Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere

like leaves.

VIOLET (V.O.)

Then one by one, he ironed all of

it.

CORKY (V.O.)

Did he sleep?

VIOLET (V.O.)

No.  But neither did I.

VIOLET (V.O.)

All night long I listened to that

sound.

CORKY (V.O.)

What sound?

VIOLET (V.O.)

The sound of money.

CORKY

And where is it now?

VIOLET

In his office.  I saw it this morning.

VIOLET

I need to go to the store.

VIOLET (V.O.)

It's in a case, on his desk.

CORKY (V.O.)

Does the case lock?

VIOLET

Yes.

CORKY

Good.

CORKY

All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.

VIOLET

Johnnie?

CORKY

It sounded like he and Caesar don't

like each other.

VIOLET

Like each other?  They hate each

other.

CORKY

Why?

VIOLET

It started way before I was around.

I think basically it's because he

thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.

But Johnnie runs Chicago because

Gino is his father.

CORKY

Who is Gino?

VIOLET

Gino Marzzone.

CORKY

Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone,

head of the Marzzone family?

VIOLET

That's his brother.

CORKY

...  shit.

CORKY

Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to

pick up the money?

VIOLET

Yeah.

CORKY

And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie

Marzzone?

VIOLET

Yeah.

CORKY

Sweet Jesus.

CORKY

It's perfect.

CORKY

Gino Marzzone is coming to your

apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't

it?  That means Caesar will be ready.

He doesn't want to look like an idiot.

Gino has been there before?

VIOLET

Yeah, twice.

CORKY

What happened?

VIOLET

Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous,

kept cleaning the apartment.  |The

first time, he picked out the dress

he wanted me to wear.

CORKY

Does Johnnie hit on you?

VIOLET

Johnnie hits on anything in high

heels.

CORKY

Has Caesar ever seen him?

VIOLET

He does it right in front of him.

CORKY

It's getting better and better.

Keep going.

VIOLET

Gino doesn't know English, or at

least he pretends he doesn't, so he

doesn't talk much.  He gets right to

the point.  Both times they talked

for about five minutes, had one drink

and then they left.

CORKY

What did Gino drink?

VIOLET

Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that

Caesar made a huge deal about it.

CORKY

All right ...

CORKY

I have an idea to make this work.

CORKY (V.O.)

You'll go back and get ready, take

your time, make it real.

CORKY (V.O.)

The more attractive you are, the

more believable it will be.

CORKY

What time did you say they would be

there?

VIOLET

The plane is in at seven, so I'd say

about eight.

CORKY

Any bodyguards?

VIOLET

Gino travels with a big man named

Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.

CORKY

Fine.

CORKY (V.O.)

At some point Caesar is going to

quit.  I'd guess sometime around

six, making sure he's got time to

get ready.

CAESAR

Un-fucking-believable, what this guy

did.  Shelly is one smart-ass

mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart-

ass motherfucker.

CORKY (V.O.)

As soon as he is done, you'll be

right there to put a big drink in

his hand.

CORKY (V.O.)

We want him to come down, to relax,

feel in control again.

VIOLET

Poor boy, has to work so hard.

CAESAR

You look good enough to eat.

VIOLET

Where will you be?

CORKY

Waiting in the apartment next door.

VIOLET (V.O.)

Waiting for what?

CORKY (V.O.)

For the shower.  That will be our

signal.

CORKY (V.O.)

When he's done with his shower, you

will go to the bar.

CORKY (V.O.)

You'll get out the Scotch that Gino

drinks.

CORKY (V.O.)

And as you do, the bottle will slip

from your hands.  -- and shatter

against the hardwood floor.

CORKY (V.O.)

An accident.

VIOLET

Shit!  Oh shit!

CAESAR (V.O.)

What happened?!

CAESAR (V.O.)

V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet?

CAESAR

V, what?  You can't hear me?

VIOLET

Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying

to get ready ...

CAESAR

Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be

kidding me!

CAESAR

Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww

goddammit!

VIOLET

I'm sorry.  It was an accident.

VIOLET

Don't worry, I'll get some more.

CAESAR

There's no time.

VIOLET

Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take

five minutes.

VIOLET

I'll clean this up and be back before

you're even dressed.

CORKY (V.O.)

When you open the door, I'll be there.

VIOLET (V.O.)

What if he sees you?

CORKY (V.O.)

He won't.

VIOLET

You can't know for certain that he

won't see you.

CORKY

Trust me, Violet.

VIOLET

I'm just asking, what if?

CORKY

If he does ...

CORKY

Then I won't have a choice, will I?

CORKY (V.O.)

When I'm inside, I will get the money.

CORKY (V.O.)

I'm going to need something ...

CORKY (V.O.)

...  to fill the case.

CORKY (V.O.)

Yeah, you should hide it near the

desk before you leave.

CORKY (V.O.)

At that point --

CORKY

There is no going back.

VIOLET

When I get the Scotch, how do I know

you won't take off?

CORKY

The same way I'll know that you went

to Scotch.  Trust.

VIOLET

I still don't see how I'm going to

get clean with the money in the

apartment.  Everyone will think I

did it.

CORKY

Not Caesar.

VIOLET

Why?

CORKY

Because of what you are going to

tell him.  You have to make it as

real as you can.  The moment you

open the door with the Scotch in

your hand, you will be covered, and

that moment is the most important

moment in the plan.

CORKY (V.O.)

If it's real enough, he'll believe

it, because deep down he'll want to.

VIOLET

C!  Shit, I'm sorry!

VIOLET

They were early.

CAESAR

What are you talking about?

VIOLET

They just left, didn't they?

CAESAR

What are you, drunk?

VIOLET

You mean they weren't up here?

CAESAR

No!  They're still on their way.

VIOLET

That doesn't make any sense.

CAESAR

Why?

VIOLET

Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

CAESAR

What?

VIOLET

I was getting out of the car when I

saw him in the Mercedes.

CAESAR

It couldn't have been.

VIOLET

It was him.  I'm positive.

CAESAR

It's impossible!

VIOLET

Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him.

I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't

believe I missed them.  I knew you

were going to be upset so I thought

I'd apologize and give Gino the

Scotch.  I honked a couple of times

but he didn't stop.

CAESAR

But Gino's plane doesn't get in for

another half-hour.

VIOLET

Actually, I didn't see Gino in the

car.

CORKY

If Caesar hates Johnnie like you

say, then the second he opens the

case he'll know, in his gut, that

Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll

realize that he has no choice.  He

can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's

only one way out.

CORKY

He'll have to run.

VIOLET

If he runs, everyone will assume he

took the money.

CORKY

You'll be clean and we'll be rich.

VIOLET

Jesus, that's beautiful.

CORKY

Thank you.

VIOLET

If you're this goddamn smart, how

did you ever get caught?

CORKY

Every job like this has moments where

things don't go so well and everyone

starts thinking about their own ass.

It's in those moments that everything

comes together or falls apart.

CORKY

I had a partner and she fucked me.

VIOLET

I won't.

CORKY

I think we're going to find out.

VIOLET

Caesar?

CAESAR

No no no no ...

VIOLET

Oh God ...

CAESAR

...  I've been set up.

VIOLET

Johnnie?

CAESAR

That fuck!  That rat-fuck!  Little

shit rat-fuck!

VIOLET

Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?

CAESAR

Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your

fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like

I hate him!

CAESAR

I hate that little fuck!  I hate

him!  I hate him!  I should've done

him!

VIOLET

But you know he did it.

CAESAR

So what?!  So fucking what?  Use

your head, Violet.  The money is

gone.  Gino is coming here to get

it.  You think he's going to believe

me if I tell him his piss-hole son

stole it!  Is that what you think?

I don't.  You know what I think?  I

think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in

the brain.  That's what I think!

VIOLET

Caesar, what are we going to do?

CAESAR

I know what he wants me to do.  He

wants me out of here.  He wants me

to run.

CAESAR

If I run, then everyone will think I

took the money and he walks away

with two million clean.

CAESAR

God, I can see him right now driving

to get Gino.  I can hear him laughing,

fucking laughing, laughing at me.

CAESAR

Laughing at me!  Laughing at me!

VIOLET

C ...

CAESAR

Don't touch me!

CAESAR

Just leave me alone!  I got to think!

CAESAR

Got to think this through ...

VIOLET

Caesar, maybe we should run --

CAESAR

Violet, please!

VIOLET

I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie,

forget the money, let's just go now,

before it's too late --

CAESAR

Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just

leave me the fuck alone!  Please!

Leave!  Now!

VIOLET

All right, Caesar.

VIOLET (V.O.)

It's me.

CORKY

What happened?

VIOLET

He totally freaked.  I've never seen

him like this.  He's out of his

fucking mind.

CORKY (V.O.)

That's okay, as long as he believes

it was Johnnie.

VIOLET

Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving

him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I

don't know, Corky, I don't know what

he is going to do.  I'm getting

nervous, really nervous.

CORKY

It's all right, Violet.  It's working.

All we got to do is wait him out and

see what he does.

VIOLET (V.O.)

What if he doesn't run?

CORKY

That means he probably will kill

Johnnie.

VIOLET (V.O.)

Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!

CORKY

Listen, if he doesn't run, all you

have to do is break down, go to your

bedroom and pack some things, start

crying, saying you love him but you

can't do it.  You're sorry but you

have to leave and just walk out.

VIOLET

okay, all right.

CORKY (V.O.)

We're almost there, Violet.  just

hang on.

VIOLET

He's coming ...

CAESAR

I got it!  I know what I got to do!

I got to get the money.

VIOLET

The money?  The money's gone.

CAESAR

No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to

do is get it back.

VIOLET

But it could be anywhere.

CAESAR

He didn't have that much time.  He

had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's

got it with him.  I bet it's in the

car.

CAESAR

He didn't see you, did he?

VIOLET

No.

CAESAR

See, right now he doesn't know that

I know, that's why he put the paper

in the case.  He wants me to hand

the case to Gino.  Then there is no

doubt it was me.  Gino will put a

bullet in me himself.  But it ain't

going to happen.  I won't let it!

Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not

like this!  No way!

VIOLET

This is insane!

CAESAR

What are you doing?

VIOLET

I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't

want to be involved.  I don't want

anything to do with this shit!

CAESAR

You can't leave.

VIOLET

The hell I can't!

CAESAR

I need you ...

VIOLET

Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've

never needed me!  I can't help you!

Understand?!  I have to get out.

CAESAR

Violet, I won't let you leave.

CAESAR

If you're not with me, Violet, then

I have to assume you're against me.

VIOLET

Caesar, this is crazy.

CAESAR

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe

you dropped the Scotch by accident.

Maybe you didn't.

CAESAR

It would have been so easy to let

him in as you went out.

VIOLET

You don't, you can't believe that

...

CAESAR

I've seen the way he looks at you.

He's always wanted you.  Maybe two

million dollars finally bought you.

CAESAR

I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be

this way.

CAESAR

I hope you understand.  I want to

trust you, I want to believe you,

but I don't have any other choice.

CAESAR

You sure you don't want a drink?

JOHNNIE

You shouldn't have hit me.

CAESAR

You want to get into this now?

JOHNNIE

No, no, Caesar.  Not now.

GINO

Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this

girl, or I find out!

JOHNNIE

You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

CAESAR

Glenlivet, right, Gino?

JOHNNIE

I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

VIOLET

I'm not drinking.

JOHNNIE

Then neither will I.

VIOLET

No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

JOHNNIE

Caesar, make that two TNTs.

JOHNNIE

Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.

GINO

No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones.

Not now.

JOHNNIE

Pop?

GINO

Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk

now.  You too, Johnnie.

GINO

Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me

what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do

me a favor, a personal favor.  For

me, eh?  You gotta start respecting

Johnnie the way you respect me.  You

understand?  Good.

GINO

And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop

acting stupid.  You gotta earn this

respect that Caesar's gonna give.

You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now,

where's my money?

GINO

We know how this was done, eh?

CAESAR

Yeah, I know.

GINO

It won't happen again, eh?

GINO

Good.

GINO

Done.  We go now.

JOHNNIE

Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours

until your plane leaves.

GINO

Caesar!

JOHNNIE

So Caesar, what did it total out at?

CAESAR

Two point one seventy-six.

JOHNNIE

Unbelievable.  Can you believe that,

Violet?

GINO

Hey, Johnnie ...

JOHNNIE

Come on, Pop, all I want to know is

one thing.  Just one thing after he

made such a big deal out of it.  I

bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it,

Caesar?

CAESAR

What's that, Johnnie?

JOHNNIE

The money I bet it was nothing to

get it clean, after you made such a

fucking big deal ...

GINO

Johnnie, what did I say?

JOHNNIE

Pop, this is important to me.  It's

a simple question.  if he would just

answer the question, that's the end

of it.

CAESAR

Where is this going, Johnnie?

JOHNNIE

Just admit it, Caesar.

CAESAR

Admit what?

JOHNNIE

That you overreacted.  That you lost

it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.

CAESAR

All right, Johnnie, you want to play

it this way, I can play it this way.

You want to know who made a mistake,

why don't you open the case.

VIOLET

Caesar ...

CAESAR

Shut up, Violet!  This is between me

and Johnnie.

CAESAR

You want to do this now, let's do

it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking

case.

CAESAR

That's right, I know.  I fucking

know.

JOHNNIE

Know what?

CAESAR

Open the case!

JOHNNIE

All right!  Where's the key?

CAESAR

You don't need a key.

JOHNNIE

How the fuck can I open it?

CAESAR

The same way you did before.

JOHNNIE

What are you talking about?

CAESAR

There you go, Johnnie.

CAESAR

Get me another.

JOHNNIE

What the ...

CAESAR

Don't!  Don't fucking move!

GINO

Caesar?  What is this?

CAESAR

Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!

JOHNNIE

What the fuck?

CAESAR

You don't think I'll do it, do you?

JOHNNIE

I think you're fucking crazy!

CAESAR

Where is it?

JOHNNIE

Where's what?

CAESAR

The money!

JOHNNIE

Caesar, I don't know what you're

thinking here, but if you don't put

down that gun --

CAESAR

Sit down!

GINO

Caesar!

CAESAR

Gino, your son stole this money to

set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!

CAESAR

Tell them!  Tell them!

VIOLET

For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what

he says.

JOHNNIE

This isn't happening ...

CAESAR

The next one blows off your dick.

JOHNNIE

You're a dead man!  A fucking dead

man!

CAESAR

Where is it?

GINO

Enough!

CAESAR

No, Gino!

GINO

You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know

who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You

understand?

CAESAR

Sit down, Gino!

GINO

No, Caesar, gimme the gun.

CAESAR

Stay away!

GINO

We're family, Caesar.

CAESAR

No!

GINO

Gimme the gun.

CAESAR

I can't.  I can't.

GINO

Give it to me.

GINO

Good man.

CORKY

This is an emergency!

CAESAR

I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.

I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.

That lying fuck.  He made me do it.

CAESAR

You lying rat-fuck.  You think you

can set me up?  Is that what you

think?  You stupid fuck.

CAESAR

I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man?

Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead?

Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take

another guess, take another fucking

guess!

VIOLET

What are you doing?

CAESAR

...  maybe three hours.

VIOLET

Caesar, what are you going to do?

CAESAR

What do you think we're going to do?

We have to find the money.

VIOLET

What?

CAESAR

Once we have the money, then none of

this ever happened.

VIOLET

Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.

CAESAR

No I didn't.  Not if his body

disappears and not if the money is

still here.  Then they never showed

up.

VIOLET

What happened to them?

CAESAR

I don't know.  We may never know,

but I'm going to guess it was a job,

maybe the Karpoli family.

CAESAR

All part of the business.

CAESAR

We just got to find the money.  Once

we do, everything is going to be all

right.

VIOLET

Oh, no.

CAESAR

Fuck.

VIOLET

Caesar, what are we going to do?

CAESAR

They're just cops.  Stall them as

long as you can.

CAESAR

Answer it!

VIOLET

Hello?

COP #1 (V.O.)

This is the police, ma'am.

VIOLET

The police?

COP #1 (V.O.)

We had a report of gunfire, so if

you could --

VIOLET

Gunfire?  Is this a joke?

COP #1 (V.O.)

No joke, ma'am.  Please open the

door.

VIOLET

How do I know you are cops?

COP #1 (V.O.)

Ma'am, you have to open the door.

VIOLET

All right.

CAESAR

Get me a wet towel.

CAESAR

If you're thinking about doing

something stupid, remember I just

killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand

what that means?

VIOLET

They're just cops.

COP #1

See?  We're for real.

VIOLET

I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.

COP #1

You did the right thing.

CAESAR

Hey, hey, Chicago's finest.

CAESAR

How's it going tonight, fellas?

COP #1

Pretty good, sir.

CAESAR

Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in

this ear.

CAESAR

I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet.

CAESAR

Violet said something about gunshots?

COP #2

Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building

called in.

COP #1

I think we know what happened.

COP #2

It was probably just the television.

CAESAR

The television?

CAESAR

Honey, why didn't you say something?

Turn it off.

CAESAR

Fuck, this happened before.  It's

this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The

batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm

sorry.

COP #1

It's all right, sir.

COP #2

No big deal.

CAESAR

Hey, can I get you guys a beer?

COP #1

Not on duty, sorry.

CAESAR

Oh, right.

COP #2

But, uh, would you mind if I used

your bathroom?

CAESAR

Yeah, why not?  It's right there.

COP #2

Thanks.

CAESAR

I'm going to make myself a drink, if

that's okay?

COP #1

Go right ahead, sir.

COP #1

This is a beautiful place.

VIOLET

...  thank you.

COP #1

Is this a condo?

COP #2

Okay, let's roll.

COP #1

Try to keep the extra batteries for

your aid around.

CAESAR

Good idea.

CAESAR

Let's go.

CORKY

...  shit.

CAESAR

Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!

VIOLET

Caesar, someone could see us out

here.

CAESAR

Get in.

CAESAR

Get in!  It's got to be at his house.

That's the only other place it could

be.

CAESAR

Violet!  Now!

CORKY

Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two

million dollars ...

CAESAR

Okay, I come in ...

CAESAR

I've got the money ...

CAESAR

I can't wait to see the look on

Caesar's face when he finds out.

CAESAR

Now I don't have much time ...

CAESAR

Got to put it someplace safe ...

CAESAR

...  put it ...

CAESAR

...  got it ...

VIOLET

C?

CAESAR

Where did I put it?

CAESAR

Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking

cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?!

CAESAR

Ow.

VIOLET

C?

VIOLET

It's not here, Caesar.

CAESAR

Where, then?

VIOLET

I don't know.  it could be anywhere.

We don't even know if he was alone.

Please, Caesar, we don't have much

time.  Let's get out of here.

VIOLET

What are you doing?

CAESAR

We're going to need some time.

VIOLET

Who are you going to call?

VIOLET

Caesar?

MICKEY (V.O.)

Yeah?

CAESAR

Hey, Mickey.

VIOLET

Oh, God.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?

CAESAR

Mick, I know it's late, but there is

a problem.  They haven't shown up

yet.

MICKEY (V.O.)

What?  They ain't there?

CAESAR

No.  I don't know where they are.  I

even called over at Johnnie's, but

no answer.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see

what I can do.  Don't go anywhere,

okay?

CAESAR

Okay, sure, Mick.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Caesar, you still got the money?

CAESAR

Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.

I'm staring right at it.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.

VIOLET

I'll start packing.  You know what

you have to do.

CAESAR

I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in

Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic

bags ...  tape and rope ...

VIOLET

Just hurry.

VIOLET

Please, Corky ...

VIOLET

Oh, thank God.

CORKY

I'm still here.

VIOLET

I was so afraid you ...

CORKY

You don't quit on me, Violet, and I

won't quit on you.

VIOLET

Corky, it worked!  He's going to

run.  He needs to take care of the

bodies to buy himself time, but as

soon as he leaves, it's over.

VIOLET (V.O.)

just a little longer and it's ours.

VIOLET

Corky, I have to tell you something

...

CORKY

I know, Violet.  I know.

CORKY

It's why I'm still here.

CAESAR (V.O.)

Violet?

CAESAR

Who was that?

CAESAR

Who the fuck was that?

CAESAR

Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?

Did you?!

CAESAR

Mickey?  Is that you?

CAESAR

Who is that?  Who is over there?!

Tell me!

VIOLET

Run!  Just run!

CAESAR

Drop the fucking gun or die!

CAESAR

Drop it!

CAESAR

Turn around.

CAESAR

You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You

gotta be kidding me!

CESAR (V.O.)

Wake up!  Come on, you fucking dyke!

CAESAR (V.O.)

Wake up!

CAESAR

Good.

CAESAR

I know everything now so I don't

want to hear any "I don't know"

bullshit, you understand?

CAESAR

God, I should have seen this coming!

The second I met you, I knew it.

Everyone knows your kind can't be

trusted!  Fucking queers make me

sick.

CAESAR

But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.

And I swear to you that I'm going to

kill you for it.

CAESAR

Where is the money?

VIOLET

Don't tell him --

CAESAR

Shut up, Violet!

VIOLET

He can't kill you --

CAESAR

Violet!

VIOLET

Not until he has the money!

CAESAR

Now, where the fuck is my money?

CORKY

Lick me.

CAESAR

Where is it?

CORKY

Either pull the trigger or get that

thing out of my face.

CAESAR

Stupid cunt!

VIOLET

Caesar, stop acting like an asshole

and think --

CAESAR

Don't try to tell me what to do.

VIOLET

You need the money just like we do.

CAESAR

Shut up, Violet.

VIOLET

Let us go and we'll make a deal.

CAESAR

Shut the fuck up!

CAESAR

What did you do to her?!  This isn't

my Violet!

CAESAR

What did she do to you?

VIOLET

Everything you couldn't.

CAESAR

You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing

before I met you.  You were nothing!

CAESAR

Who gave you this place?  This

apartment?

CAESAR

Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I

gave you everything!  I gave you

this life!  I made you, Violet.  I

saved you.

CAESAR

I saved you.

VIOLET

Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at

yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug.

|You launder money for the mob.  You

rent women like you rented this

apartment.

VIOLET

Saved me?  You don't even know me.

You used me, Caesar, just like I

used you.  All part of the business.

CAESAR

You betrayed me!

VIOLET

You murdered Gino!

CAESAR

I had to.  You made me.

VIOLET

Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me.

You did it because you couldn't stand

the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

CAESAR

Shut up!

CAESAR

Okay, you want business, I'll give

you the fucking business.

CAESAR

I'm going to make you beg just like

Shelly did.  Just like Shelly!

VIOLET

I'm sorry, Corky ...

CORKY

Don't be sorry.  Help me.

CAESAR

Oh, no no no.

CAESAR

Hey, Violet, you remember these?

CAESAR

I'm going to start with her so you'll

get a good idea what's coming.

CAESAR

I'm going to ask you where the money

is.  Every time you don't give me an

answer, I'm going to cut off one

finger.

CORKY

No.

CAESAR

When I reach ten, then I'll start

with you.

CAESAR

Where is the money?

CAESAR

...  Mickey.

CAESAR

I said where --

CORKY

No!  I'll tell you!

CORKY

It's over there in the empty

apartment.

CORKY

I put it inside one of the paint

drums.

CAESAR

I promised I would kill you.

CORKY

You can't kill me yet.

CAESAR

Why?

CORKY

I could be lying.

CAESAR

You're going to wish to God you hadn't

done that.

CAESAR

Fuck.

CAESAR

Son of a bitch ...

CAESAR

Mickey will get in.  I know he will.

CAESAR

Violet.  I can kill you right now if

that's what you want.  If you want

to live, then you have to help me.

I need you to make Mickey believe

that everything is normal.

CAESAR

Tell me, do you want to live?

CAESAR

Good girl.

CAESAR

Jesus Christ!

CAESAR

Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the

shit outta me.

CAESAR

What is this?  what are you two doing,

sneaking in here with your peckers

in your hands?  You gonna do me,

Mick?  Is that it?

MICKEY

No, Cease.  There was no answer.

CAESAR

I thought I heard someone knocking.

MICKEY

I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I

guess you couldn't hear me on account

of being in the shower.

CAESAR

Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was

so wound up about Gino, she was trying

to help me relax.

MICKEY

That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish

someone would help me relax.

CAESAR

Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get

you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.

MICKEY

We was worried about you, Cease.

CAESAR

Me?  Why?

MICKEY

We went over to Johnnie's place just

to check it out and it was busted

up, Bad.

MICKEY

I started thinking maybe it's about

the money so I call you, but all I

get is the busy signal.  I figure

the phone is off the hook, that's

why I come rushing over here.

CAESAR

Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a

fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't

it?

MICKEY

Hey, if Violet was helping me relax,

I'd probably do the same thing.

MICKEY

Cease, can I ask you something?

CAESAR

Yeah.

MICKEY

Why'd you move all the furniture

around?

MICKEY

Let me guess.  That was Violet's

idea, too.

CAESAR

Actually, yeah, she was nervous about

Gino coming, wanted everything to

look right.  You know women, Mick.

MICKEY

Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid

things, don't they.

MICKEY

Is that the money?

CAESAR

Yeah, that's it.

MICKEY

That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand

it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were

him I would have bailed a long time

ago.  I mean, how much money does a

man need?

MICKEY

I remember I was just staring at all

this goddamn money, Shelly down on

his knees, and the next thing I know,

Johnnie just blows his head off.

MICKEY

What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's

laughing his ass off and that's when

Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He

coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks

Johnnie Marzzone.

MICKEY

Hey, Caesar, where's the key?

CAESAR

The key, yeah, the key's in my pants

in the bathroom.

MICKEY

Fuck it, I don't need the key.

MICKEY

I didn't need a key to get in here,

did I?

MICKEY

Who the hell could that be?

MICKEY

You gonna answer it?

CESAR (V.O.)

Hello?

VIOLET

Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino.

CAESAR (V.O.)

What?

VIOLET

You're blowing your only chance.

Act like I'm Gino.

CAESAR

Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've

been going crazy over here, Gino!

VIOLET (V.O.)

Good boy.

CAESAR

It's Gino!  It's Gino!

MICKEY

Where in the hell is he?

VIOLET

We were in a car accident --

CAESAR (V.O.)

They were in a car accident.

VIOLET

But everybody is all right.

CAESAR

They're all fine.  Just bruises and

shit.

VIOLET (V.O.)

Now you listen to me, asshole, I

know your gun is behind the bar ...

MICKEY

Un-fucking-believable.  I called

those highway patrol dumb fucks.

CAESAR

Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!

VIOLET (V.O.)

We make a deal or I come out and

hand this phone to Mickey.

CAESAR

I'm listening.

VIOLET

I want what's mine, half the money.

We get rid of Mickey, no one else

dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.

CAESAR (V.O.)

Yes, I understand.

VIOLET

Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the

Kennedy, in the waiting room, but

stay on the phone until I come out.

CAESAR (V.O.)

Sure, Gino, sure.

CAESAR

St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.

Okay, Gino.

VIOLET

Mickey?  What are you doing here?

MICKEY

Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They

were in a car accident.

VIOLET

Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?

MICKEY

I think everything is okay.

CAESAR

They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting

room.

MICKEY

I can't fit them all in my car so

give me your keys.  You drive my

car, Lou.

CAESAR

Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet!

CAESAR

Go grab my car keys from my pants in

the bathroom.

CAESAR

Please, help us out, Mickey wants to

get going.

MICKEY

They might want to go straight to

the airport and back to Miami, so I

better take this.

MICKEY

You got the key?

CAESAR

Oh yeah.  Violet!

CAESAR (V.O.)

Violet!

CAESAR (V.O.)

Violet!

MICKEY

Thanks, V.

CAESAR

Call me as soon as you get him.

MICKEY

Leave your phone on the hook.

CAESAR

Now that's teamwork.

VIOLET

I should have let him kill you.

CAESAR

You know he would have done you,

too.

VIOLET

I knew I couldn't trust you.

CAESAR

I said I'd let you live and I will.

CAESAR

Maybe.

CAESAR

Time to find out if the dyke was

stupid enough to lie.

CAESAR

Yes!

CAESAR

No!

CAESAR

Violet!

CAESAR

Fuck!

CAESAR

Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now!

VIOLET

Come on.  Come on, please.

CAESAR

Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch.

VIOLET

Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

MICKEY (V.O.)

Violet?

VIOLET

He made me help him, Mickey, God, I

was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all

Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's

coming - Oh God!

VIOLET

Corky?

VIOLET

Corky!

VIOLET

Stop!

VIOLET

It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey.

He's on his way.

VIOLET

Get out of here, Caesar.  If you

want to live you had better start

running.

CAESAR

All these years and you still don't

know me, Violet.

CAESAR

But I know you.

VIOLET

Caesar, don't.

CAESAR

What are you going to do, V?  Shoot

me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't

think so.  I'll tell you why.  If

you had it in you to pull that

trigger, you would have done it a

long time ago.  If I was you, I would

have killed me the minute I brought

the money home.  But you didn't and

I know why, because you don't want

to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?

No, I know you don't.

VIOLET

Caesar, you don't know shit.

DISSOLVE TO:

VIOLET

I will never understand it, Mickey.

You didn't even call the police.

MICKEY

I told you, the family doesn't want

the police around.  We want to take

care of it ourselves and we will.

I'll find him.  I swear I will.

VIOLET

I know you will.

MICKEY

Sure you're going to be okay?  I

mean, if you're having second

thoughts, my offer still stands.

VIOLET

Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get

out, you know?  Get away from all of

this.

VIOLET

But thanks.  Thanks for everything.

CORKY

Hey.

VIOLET

Hey.

CORKY

How'd it go?

VIOLET

I'm here, aren't I?

CORKY

I guess we should get out of here.

CORKY

Thought we might need a getaway car.

CORKY

You know what the difference is

between us, Violet?

VIOLET

No.

CORKY

...  Me neither.
