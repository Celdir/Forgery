"THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY" -- by Alan Cumming & Jennifer Jason Leigh

STEVEN (O.S.)

And breath...and chataronga...

LUCY (O.S.)

(over answering machine; sweet,

British, slightly desperate)

Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the

black sheep here.  Bah...not funny.

Haven't heard from you, need you, call

me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe,

I'd love to talk to you before I go...

JOE

Go where?

LUCY (O.S.)

(over answering machine)

It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big

brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you.

I lo--

JOE

America, could you just...

JOE (CONT'D)

(calls out)

Thank you, America!

STEVEN

Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let

your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up

and into downward dog.

JOE AND SALLY

Good boy, Otis.

VOICE (O.S.)

(over answering machine)

Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for

Sally Therrian.

SALLY

Hello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God.

SALLY

No luck.

JOE

Oh, well, we'll just have to try again.

Sound like a plan?

SALLY

Happy anniversary, baby.

JOE

Happy anniversary.

STEVEN

And change sides...

AMERICA

(with the authority of long

years of service)

Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If

you please now...

JOE

It's yours.

JOE

I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the

world.

SALLY

Hardly...

JOE

Accept a compliment.

SALLY

I think you're the most beautiful woman

in the world.

JOE

What did you get me?

SALLY

In the morning, after everyone's gone and

there's just us.

JOE

Kiss my eyes.

SALLY

My wrists.

JOE

Kiss the back of my knees.

SALLY

Through the sweats or not?

JOE

Not.

SALLY

What?

JOE

You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did

you?

SALLY

No.  Did you?

JOE

(after a beat)

No.  I missed that.

SALLY

I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't

we?

JOE

We're great.

SALLY

I mean, you're really back.

JOE

For good.

JOE (CONT'D)

Don't get it.

SALLY

Well, it might be Clair.  They're

threatening not to come...

JOE

What?

SALLY

They can't find a sitter...

(into the receiver)

Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.

(she looks at Joe)

Just a moment.

(puts the call on hold)

It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions

to the house.  You invited Skye fucking

Davidson to our anniversary party?

JOE

Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell

you.  It was the only chance I had to

meet her.

SALLY

You invited her to our anniversary party?

I didn't even invite my mother.

JOE

She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,

I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on

hold.

SALLY

(pissed)

No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking

Davidson, for fuck's sake.

JOE

(regards her)

You want me to uninvite her?

SALLY

No, no of course not.  How old is she?

Twenty-fucking-two?

SALLY (CONT'D)

(into the bathroom mirror)

And she's a stinking fucking actress, for

fuck's sake.

JOE

(into the receiver)

Skye!

(his face lights)

I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's

our sixth, actually.

(flattered)

You read the book again?  Well, no, the

ending to chapter six...it's just that

it's not filmic.

We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it

just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can

absolutely look at that again.  If you're

coming from Laurel, you want to take

Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers

State Park.  Three blocks west of that,

you want to hang right.  It's about three

quarters of a mile up a big white thing

on the left.

JOE (CONT'D)

Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure

they're well behaved.  All our friends

have dogs, and they always want to bring

them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So

we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.

JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.

And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're

willing to take this leap with me.

Eternally grateful, really.

SALLY

(into the bathroom mirror)

I'm going to throw up.

JOE (O.S.)

I can't imagine anyone else playing

Genna.

SALLY

(sanguine)

Really?

JOE

Who the fuck can be here at this time?

It's not even seven!

SALLY

Oh Jesus, who else is always early for

Christ's sake?

SALLY (CONT'D)

Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

JOE

I'll say as little as possible.

SALLY

I love you.

JUDY

I know we're early, we're so early.

Sorry.

JERRY

You have to sign your taxes anyway.

SALLY

(a grin)

Of course we do.

(to Judy)

We have to sign our taxes.

JOE

(kisses Judy; all charm)

You can never be too early or too thin.

JERRY

Happy anniversary, buddy!  Six months

ago, who would have thunk it?

JOE

(sotto)

Well, not me, to be honest.

JERRY

(sotto)

Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple

effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer.

JUDY

(offers)

We have a gift?

JOE

Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?

JUDY

Lovely.

JERRY

(a moment, to Sally)

We closed.

SALLY

Fantastic.

(takes his hand)

Out here.

JUDY

(finally, to no one, and to no

response)

The house looks beautiful, are those

hydrangeas?

JERRY

Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,

Chelsea, London, England.  No small

doing.

SALLY

I love you, you're a genius.

JERRY

I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.

I'm not sure it's in your best interest.

SALLY

I adore him.

JERRY

The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the

morning.  The house had to go on the

market to insure the loan on the London

flat.

SALLY

I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

JERRY

What you earn has to double in order to

cover expenses in London, it's an

outrageously expensive city.

SALLY

We've only been over this how many times?

JERRY

You only made half your quote this year.

SALLY

Well, you're a tower of support.

JERRY

I worry because you don't.  It's my job.

I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it

if you waited until the two of you were

on more solid ground.

SALLY

(direct, simple)

We couldn't be on more solid ground.

JERRY

Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

JOE (O.S.)

Otis!  No barking!

SALLY

(touched)

And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a

rock star in London.  His novels sell

millions.

JERRY

Not millions.

SALLY

He's directing now.

JERRY

They're paying him scale.

SALLY

He gets huge advances on his novels.

He's going back to that.  You know how he

hates it here.

JERRY

There's still time to undo this.

SALLY

(kisses his cheek)

We'll be fine.

JERRY

(re: barking dog)

Did you invite them?

SALLY

The Roses?  And of course they said yes.

JERRY

That was the plan.  And you're thrilled

to have them.

SALLY

Whatever you say.

JERRY

Did you tell Joe to behave?

SALLY

Yes.

JERRY

Did he promise?

SALLY

Scout's honor.

JERRY

Before I forget.

(pulls a novel from his

briefcase)

Put it on the bookshelf.

SALLY

You're out of your mind.

JERRY

Just do what I say, alright?

SALLY

How much bowing and scraping do you want

us to do?

JERRY

Beats a lawsuit.

JOE

(to fill the silence,

conspiratorial grin)

I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?

JUDY

(chokes on the champagne)

Nothing that can't be exchanged.

JOE

Oh.  Well.  Good.

JUDY

Congratulations on the deal.  How

exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean

it's Sally.  The character that's based

on Sally.  The character that's based on

Sally in the book.

JOE

The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing

the lead.

JUDY

Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.

She's very beautiful.

JOE

Yes, she is.

JUDY

(trying harder)

But I am right, yes?  She's based on

Sally.

JOE

It's a novel.

JUDY

Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.

JOE

Yes.

JUDY

I'm not much of a reader, but I do love

autobiographies, even biographies

sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you

read the new Styron?

JOE

No.

JUDY

It's very good.

(a moment)

I understand you won the Booker Prize.

JOE

Yes I did.

JUDY

(another moment)

Is your script much like the novel?

Jerry says it's very good.  But you know,

you read the novel, and then you see the

movie - and most of the time you say,

"what's this?" You know?  I sometimes

think we're better off not reading the

novel at all.  Because, we come with

expectations... and of course, we know

where we're going.  Don't you find?

JOE

Don't I find what?

JUDY

I don't know why Joe, we've known each

other how long...

JOE

Not long.

JUDY

(benign)

Don't be silly.

JOE

Joking.

JUDY

Yes I know.  I started to say... I

started to say Joe that --

JOE

Do I put you off?

JUDY

You manage to throw me off balance.  I

adore you.

JOE

And I you.

JUDY

But I'm always afraid I'll say something

stupid.

JOE

Ah.

JUDY

And so I always manage to, do you see?

Like the book/script thing, do you see?

JOE

Mmm hmmm.

SALLY

You know Jerry.

CAL

Yes, of course.

SOPHIA

I'm the wife.  We've met.

JERRY

(hugs her)

You, I know.

SALLY

(to Evie)

Hey, beautiful girl.

SOPHIA

(a grin)

Jack?  Jack, you promised.

JACK

(sings)

Happy anniversary to you.  We're glad Joe

came home.  Don't split up again.  Cause

we like the food.

JOE

(in the archway)

Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?

CAL

Absolutely.

JOE

Had a little help?

CAL

Absolutely not.

JOE

It has your ring.

CAL

I'm not that good.

JERRY

Cal, my wife Judy.

JUDY

Nice to meet you.

CAL

I think we've met, actually.  No?  At

another one of these things?

JUDY

No, I don't think so.

JERRY

(to Cal)

Congratulations on the Academy Award.

Great performance.  Really warranted.

SOPHIA

He thought so.

JERRY

Sally always manages to get robbed.

SALLY

(a mortified grin)

Enough about me.

SOPHIA

Evie has a little something for you.

SOPHIA (CONT'D)

You do.

EVIE

(even)

I don't think so.

SALLY

Since when are you so shy?

EVIE

(her mother's daughter)

Never.

SOPHIA

(bright smile)

Honey, we have gifts for you and all

sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I

know she's here somewhere.

JOE

I'll take them.

SOPHIA

No, I have a little talking to do with

America.  Privately.  I'll find her.

SALLY

(to Sophia)

In the kitchen.

JOE

Who'd like to go and find Otis?

EVIE

Me!

JACK

I guess.

JUDY

The infamous dog?

JOE

He's the best dog in the world.

(to Judy)

They're both coming tonight.  Not my

idea.

JUDY

Ours.

JOE

It's Jerry's worst idea.

CAL

What's that?

JOE

The neighbors from hell.  The kind that

lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually.

Wouldn't I?

(to Sally)

Wouldn't I?

SALLY

(small smile)

Yes.

JOE

(to the kids)

Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly

old bum.

INT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

JOE

Well, hello you two.

(putting Evie down; to Jack)

These are the people who live next door.

Say hello.

JOE (CONT'D)

And close the door, Jack.  Because if we

leave it open, Otis will run out and you

know what will happen then?

JACK

Uh, uh.

JOE

He'll run next door into their backyard

and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat

their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a

pitbull?

RYAN

(not amused)

No, actually.

JOE

(to Jack)

Oh whatever.  We don't want that to

happen, do we?

JACK

No?

RYAN

It's a rottweiler, actually.

(to Jack)

I don't think our rottweiler is in any

danger, Jack.

JOE

Well, Jack and I are very relieved.

RYAN

I thought this was a party.  Are we going

to talk about the dog thing?

MONICA

Please, Ryan.

JOE

(kisses her cheek and shakes

his hand)

No, he's absolutely right.  You're

absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be

banned.  Canine conversations are

completely discouraged... it's really

good of you to join us.  Can I get you a

drink?

RYAN

Not for me, thanks.

MONICA

(checks with Ryan)

Something soft.

JOE

Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't

like something soft, Ryan?

RYAN

I'm sure, yes.

SALLY

Hi.  Monica and Ryan?

MONICA

Sally?

SALLY

Yes.  And you've met Joe.

RYAN

Yes.

SALLY

(a deep breath)

Well, so glad you decided to come.

MONICA

We could hardly say no.

SALLY

Oh?

SALLY (CONT'D)

(takes the gift)

Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I

hope you've noticed that Otis isn't

barking as much.  We keep him in at

night.

RYAN

At 4:30 today he barked for a solid

fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.

SALLY

You're keeping a record, are you?

RYAN

It's just very distracting when you're

trying to work.

MONICA

Ryan.

RYAN

(to Joe)

I'm sure you understand.

SALLY

Well the neighborhood is full of dogs,

and it's not always Otis.

RYAN

Well today it was Otis.  And you should

keep him away from our yard.  Because

Sheila will defend herself.

MONICA

Ryan!

SALLY

(cuts off response from Joe; to

Ryan)

Are you working on a new book?

RYAN

(caught short; flattered)

Well, yes, actually.

MONICA

He always has two or three going...

SALLY

Really?  Joe can't manage more than one

at a time.  With huge gaps in between.

MAC

You lose this?

JOE

(re: Otis)

Ah there's our snookums now.

RYAN

Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker

either.  Or the Whitebread.

MAC

The gate was open.

SALLY

Well, not yet.

(she reacts to Mac)

The gate was open?

JOE

It's taken care of.

MONICA

I think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I

think he's outgrown him.  They're just

not doing their job.

SALLY

Hors d'oeuvres or something?

MONICA

Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.

SALLY

Thank you.  I understand you're an

interior decorator.

MONICA

Yes.

SALLY

I so wish I'd known.

MONICA

Well, whoever did this is amazing.

SALLY

I did it.

JOE

(comes on them with the

Forsythes in tow)

She rarely cops to it.

(kisses Sally's cheek)

Otis is home.

CLAIR

(re: the gifts)

Where can I put these?

CLAIR (CONT'D)

What a fucking day!  We only just got a

sitter.  I don't know her from fucking

Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm

going to have to call every ten minutes.

You have to let me give out the number.

SALLY

Of course.

MAC

She already has.

CLAIR

It's alright, isn't it?

SALLY

Of course it's alright.

MAC

Clair is a hovering mother.

CLAIR

I'm not.

SALLY

This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.

CLAIR

(a wide professionally

ingratiating smile)

So nice...

MONICA

And for us... Truly.

CLAIR

Well...

MONICA

You will never know.

CLAIR

(pleased)

Oh.

(to Sally)

I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we

may have to leave early.

SALLY

Why didn't you bring him?

CLAIR

What?

SALLY

Why didn't you bring him?

CLAIR

(searches)

He's allergic.

SALLY

Oh.

CLAIR

To dander.  Otis.

SALLY

Oh.

CLAIR

Didn't I say?

SALLY

Well, probably.

CLAIR

They can tell from the eyelashes, you

know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They

must be a foot long.  The older you are

when you have a baby, the more likely

this stuff is to crop up.

SALLY

(muted)

Oh.

CLAIR

So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of

course.

(kisses her cheek)

How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic.

It changes your life, you know.  A baby.

It puts everything in perspective,

doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't

be the center of your own world, anymore.

MAC

(as grounded as Clair isn't)

It's an object lesson in grace.

(on seeing Cal Gold on the back

porch)

Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My

leading man is on time for once.

CAL

(at the piano)

Those who can't direct.

MAC

Fuck you.

CAL

Are those our dailies?  You're totally

outrageous.  It's their anniversary.  Is

nothing sacred!  Well...so...how am I?

MAC

(laughing)

Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the

kitchen scene.

CAL

I liked the third take, the accidental

disaster with the silverware.

MAC

Nothing you do is accidental...

GINA

(re: the cameras)

I'm the hired help.

JOE

(affectionate)

Fuck you.

GINA

I never put myself in harm's way.

JOE

Anymore.

GINA

No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary,

scout.

SOPHIA

Oh my God!  America told me your

neighbors are coming?

SALLY

And here they are!

SOPHIA

And she was saying how happy you were to

finally have them over.  Because you're

both, so, what - introspective?  And you

should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia

Gold.

(rescuing Sally)

Come meet my husband, Cal.

MONICA

Cal Gold?

SOPHIA

The very one.  And you are...

SALLY

Monica and Ryan.

RYAN

Rose.

SOPHIA

Sorry?

RYAN

Ryan Rose.

SOPHIA

Yes.

SALLY

He's a novelist.

SOPHIA

Ah.

SALLY

Like Joe.

SOPHIA

Hmm.

(to Sally)

Where are my kids?

SALLY

In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint

table for them.

SOPHIA

I hope they're watercolors!

SALLY

Nevermind.

SOPHIA

(to Monica)

Would you like to meet my husband?

MONICA

I'd be thrilled.

SOPHIA

Then he'll be thrilled.

JOE

(re: Sophia, appreciative)

She's such pure evil.

SALLY

Thanks for coming.

GINA

Happy anniversary.  You're a good match,

you two.

(to Joe)

Can you help me with this stuff?

JOE

(re: one of her bags)

That for us?

GINA

What a nose.  You missed your calling.

JOE

Can I open it?

GINA

(defers)

Sally?

JOE

Please?

SALLY

He's impossible.  Go on then.

SALLY (CONT'D)

(respectful of the talent)

It's beautiful, thank you so much.

JOE

I love you,  Gina Taylor.

CUT TO:

SOPHIA

You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.

CLAIR

(pleased)

You think so!?  I've been working out a

lot since the baby.

And I've been working.  And that takes

it's toll, you know.

SOPHIA

I'm glad that's all over for me.

CLAIR

Don't you miss it?

SOPHIA

Never.

CLAIR

Really.

SOPHIA

Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.

CLAIR

Really?

SOPHIA

So where is young Jonah?

CLAIR

With a sitter.  We have a sensational

sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with

her.  You know, a second mom sort of.

Like part of the family.  Amazing with

kids.

SOPHIA

What is that thing?

CLAIR

So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm

still not used to leaving him.

SOPHIA

You should have brought him.

CLAIR

(shrugs)

Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.

SOPHIA

Oh.  Do you have any pictures?

CLAIR

Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I

left my tote in the damn trailer.  But!

He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac

shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact

is they probably didn't even need me for

this birth.

SOPHIA

Are you the funniest person I know, or

what?

CLAIR

I can't think how you gave it all up,

Soph.

CLAIR (CONT'D)

(freeks)

Oh my God, the dog!

CLAIR

It sounds hysterical, but Otis just

rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like

to change into something of yours.  You

know it could be disaster.  He's so

allergic.  It's terrifying.

SALLY

Borrow whatever you like.

CLAIR

I'll change back before we leave.

SALLY

(pointed)

Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all

be too big for you.

(a moment)

Are you alright, Clair?

CLAIR

I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little

stressed.  And I've been taking pills to

get my weight down since the baby.

SALLY

I'd say it was down.

CLAIR

And the doctor said they might make me a

little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly

headache, actually.

SALLY

You want a Tylenol, or something?

CLAIR

I'd love a Xanex.

(a moment)

Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm

not breast feeding.

SALLY

Why would she care?

CLAIR

You know Sophia.  She's so damned

judgemental.  And she's so damned...

perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just

fucking don't tell her.  Because you know

Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him

comparing.

SALLY

You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

CLAIR

Just don't fucking tell her.

SALLY

It's not going to come up.

JOE

(opens the door)

Panes!  How are you?

PANES

Oh, you know, I am.

JOE

Has she called?

PANES

She'll never call again.  She called last

week to tell me she'll never call again.

Where's Sally?

SALLY (O.S.)

Here I am.  Panes, my love!

SALLY (CONT'D)

(for Panes; a long supportive

hug; a kiss)

Good, you brought your violin.  I want

you to play.

PANES

It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill

myself.

SALLY

Are you lovesick?

PANES

Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.

SALLY

Will champagne help?

PANES

Not enough.

SALLY

Panes is here!

PANES

(gives everyone a shy, pained

little wave)

Oh great.

EVERYONE

Panes!

MONICA/RYAN

(a little late; into silence)

Panes.

SKYE

Hi.

JOE

(his face lights up)

Skye!

SKYE

You're Joe, aren't you?

(nods knowingly)

I recognized you from the book jacket.

JOE

How do you do, Skye?

SKYE

Oh, I love that.

(throws arms around him)

I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here.

And I apologize for invading you.  And

I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so

touched.  I know how private you and

Sally are.

JOE

(uncomfortable)

Yeah, well, it's just us and a few

hundred of our closest friends.

SKYE

(genuine)

When I read your work I felt that you

knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And

this one in particular speaks to me, do

you know?  I am Genna.  How many women

must tell you that.  And the script is

wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and

visual...

JOE

I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so

relieved you said yes, and I'm really,

um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to

finally meet you.

SKYE

You're going to be a remarkable director,

a brilliant director.

JOE

(finally)

I think you're my first Goddess.

PANES

She's even better looking in the flesh.

SALLY

Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with

me.

SALLY

Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't

believe that bitch is in my house.

PANES

You don't know she's a bitch.

SALLY

She's all over him, are you blind?

PANES

It could be worse.

SALLY

How?

PANES

She could be playing the role in Joe's

movie that should be yours.

SALLY

Fuck you, Panes.

PANES

You see, that's worse.

SALLY

I just wanted tonight to be with the

people we love.

PANES

Like your business managers?

SALLY

They're not just our business managers,

Panes.

PANES

Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are

here, for fuck's sake.

SALLY

Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.

PANES

It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's

one of your parties.

SALLY

I don't want it to be just one of our

parties.

PANES

"How are you really doing, Panes?"

"Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."

SALLY

Like the last time.

PANES

No.  No, not like the last time.  She was

the rest of my life.

SALLY

Like the last time.

PANES

I wasn't finished.

SALLY

Okay.

PANES

"We can't stand seeing you like this,

Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why

don't you stay with us for a while?"

"I'd love to, thanks."

SALLY

It's our anniversary, Panes.

PANES

I didn't hear me say tonight.

SALLY

We're just feeling our way back.

PANES

"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being

here."

SALLY

You know it's true.

SKYE

(stuck)

Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.

SALLY

I'll be right out.

PANES

(over Sally)

Come on in.

SKYE

I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh

my God.  You're my icon.  I've been

watching your films since I was a little

girl.  Like, four years ago I followed

you all around the Beverly Center - at

least half a day, working up the courage

to introduce myself.

SALLY

I don't think I ever spent half a day in

the Beverly Center.

SKYE

Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all

your movies.  When I was in rehab, the

second time, they wouldn't even let us

see your drug addict movie.  They said

you were too real.  I worship you.  And I

couldn't be more flattered, because I

know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie

is based on you as a young woman.

SKYE (CONT'D)

And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it

justice.  And I hope we can spend time

together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my

worst quality.

PANES

Not at all.

SKYE

Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye

Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you

look like Peter Sellers?

PANES

No, never.

SALLY

(overlapping Panes)

Everyday.

PANES

I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us,

Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

SALLY

It's nice to meet you... again.

SKYE

(to America)

Oh my God, she remembers me!

SALLY

(under her breath)

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

CLAIR

(on the way down; a dream in

white)

My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It

took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I

found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my

life.

SALLY

(a moment; sotto)

Shit!

PANES

(re: the dress)

I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.

SALLY

Shit.  It's my Galiano.

PANES

What does that mean?

SALLY

About five thousand dollars.  With my

discount.

GINA

(regards him)

Directing suits you.

JOE

I'm not so sure.  Look again in three

months.

GINA

It must be nice having so many strangers

kiss your ass all of a sudden.

JOE

Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get

fucked.

GINA

Just did.  Jealous?

JOE

When does he graduate high school?

GINA

(laughing)

Oh, very jealous.

GINA (CONT'D)

I saw Lucy when I was in London, she

seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.

JOE

Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's

off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my

grandad's flat in London's been sold.

GINA

In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a

meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

JOE

I should have damn well bought it.  Well,

we can't afford it.  The movie's going to

eat up a year of my life and I'm getting

paid next to nothing.  Do you know how

much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four

million.

GINA

Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow

job.

JOE

You really need to be fucked.

SALLY

So how are you really doing, Panes?

PANES

Why don't you go fuck yourself?

SALLY

(laughs)

No.  Really.  For real.  Really.

PANES

I'm worried about your Galiano.

SALLY

(slaps him)

You're a shit.

PANES

No, really, five thousand with your

discount.

PANES (CONT'D)

You hurt, you know.  You're stronger than

you think.

PANES (CONT'D)

(finally)

How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You

are making a movie, aren't you?

SALLY

Yes.  Fine.

PANES

That's it?  Yes.  Fine?

SALLY

I don't want to talk about it.

PANES

Why not?

SALLY

I never like to talk about my work.

PANES

Alright.  Well, that's something new.

SALLY

No.  Not something new.

PANES

Well, something's wrong.

SALLY

Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay?

Having the time of my life.  Mac's a

fantastic director.  And what can anyone

say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And

it's great working with friends, blah

blah blah.

PANES

(a moment; little smile)

Um.  Happy for you.

SALLY

Thanks.

PANES

So tell me, how's it going?

SALLY

Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second

thoughts.  Am I a monster?

PANES

You're my best friend.

SALLY

That's not an answer, is it?

PANES

Yes, you're a monster.

SALLY

(a moment)

Thank you, Panes.

PANES

You don't need to thank me.

SALLY

(another moment)

We're going to have to go back out there.

PANES

I guess.

JEFFREY

Let me.

(pours for her)

I'm Jeffrey.

MONICA

Monica.

JEFFREY

And you know our friends, how?

MONICA

We live next door.

JEFFREY

Oh.  You're them.

MONICA

Excuse me?

JEFFREY

We've heard lots about you.

MONICA

(lost)

You have?

JUDY

(smiles over at Ryan)

Hi.

RYAN

Hi.  A little close in there.

JUDY

Yup.

MONICA

Your Eames table is incredible.  And the

B&B.  I just put that in a client's home,

actually, but in red.

JOE

You're an interior decorator, right?

MONICA

(nods)

Sally did all this herself?

JOE

In fits and starts -- and then, later, of

course, she had to accommodate me.  So

things shifted a little bit then, became

more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.

MONICA

(somehow at a loss)

Mmm.  It says something about the two of

you maybe.

JOE

Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.

(re: champagne)

I see you've moved up from the soft

stuff.

MONICA

Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober

eight years.  And it's difficult if I...

you know.  It's better if I don't.

JOE

Uh-huh.

MONICA

I'm a little nervous, so...

JOE

Oh.

MONICA

A little out of my element.

JOE

No you're not.

MONICA

Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on

the outside, yes.  And there's been all

this friction.

JOE

Hm.

MONICA

I don't know why, but these

misunderstandings have a way of

escalating.

JOE

Very well put.

MONICA

I think a lot of this could have been

avoided if Sally made more of an effort.

JOE

What?

MONICA

But you're very private people.  You

know, there's a kind of elitism...

JOE

(pissed)

Elitism?

MONICA

The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that.

And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.

JOE

And you know, he really does not.

MONICA

And Ryan works at home.

JOE

And your phone calls are nasty and

abusive.  And I've come this close to

suing you for harassment.  And you're

only here because we're supposed to be

sucking up to you.

JOE (CONT'D)

Oh shit.  I'm sorry.

MONICA

Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was

more generous, actually.

JOE

Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking

maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke

for myself, this needn't rub off on my

wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes.

Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite.

It's just, I really love my dog and he

doesn't really bark a lot.

We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs

barking at night, too.  And it's not

Otis.

MONICA

Alright.

JOE

Easy tiger.

MONICA

Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm

drinking.

JOE

Scout's honor.

MONICA

(grins)

I'll be your best friend.

MONICA (CONT'D)

Would you sign it for me.

(digs for a pen)

I'm sure this is inappropriate.

JOE

We're way past inappropriate.

MONICA

(as he signs it)

I'll treasure this.

JOE

I need to leave you now.

MONICA

I will treasure this.

JOE

(shouting down the hall)

Sally!!!!

SALLY

Panes?

PANES

From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

MAC

What?

SALLY

Trust him.

PANES

It's Shostakovich.

SALLY

Sandy...

SANFORD

The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.

SALLY

(turns to him)

Ryan?

RYAN

(pleased)

I didn't know you had this.

SALLY

Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You

think you could sign it for us?

RYAN

Absolutely.  You always wonder where your

books end up.  Why don't we use it?

JUDY

Good idea.

RYAN

There's not a chance in hell anyone will

get it...

MAC

Down by Law.

SOPHIA

Who's not going to get that in fifteen

seconds.

JOE

Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down,

and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.

CAL

Why last?

MONICA

The Katzenjammer Kids.

MONICA (CONT'D)

You know.  It's the Funnies.  The

Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's

favorite charade's clue.  No one ever

gets it.

JOE

Alright.  Good.  Fine, I vote for that.

MONICA

With a "Z."  K. A. T. Z.

GINA

When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He

Thinks Like a King What He Knows...

GINA (CONT'D)

SKYE

Utopia Parkway...

JOE

Who's keeping time?

JOE (CONT'D)

Two minutes.

SALLY

(deferring first turn to Joe)

It's alright.  Be our guests.

JOE

(offers the hat)

You darling.

PANES

(reads clue; to Joe)

What is it?

PANES (CONT'D)

What's a sign for that?

JOE

Come on, Panes...

JERRY

Go!

JEFFREY

What the hell is that?

SALLY

What is it Panes?

SOPHIA

Two words.

JUDY

Funny.

SANFORD

Funnies?

RYAN

The Katzenjammer Kids.

JERRY

(already pissed)

It's only just started.  Great.  The

husband's on the other fucking team.

MAC

Go.

JERRY

Hey!  Would you?

MAC

It was fifteen seconds.

JERRY

I don't think so.

MAC

Are you always this much fun?

SALLY

(a grin)

Take your time, Jer.

JERRY

I'm ready.

CAL

Song.

GINA

Cycle.

CAL

Two words.  Second word.

TEAM

Think.  Pain.

CAL

(among others)

Ponder.

JERRY

Come on, folks.

CAL

First word.

TEAM

To, the, but, or...

TEAM (CONT'D)

Third word.  One syllable.

TEAM (CONT'D)

Fuck...sounds like... Fork.  Flock...

TEAM (CONT'D)

Fuck.  Folk.

TEAM (CONT'D)

Second word.

MAC

Thirty seconds.

JOE

Jer.  Over here.  Over here.

TEAM

Second word.

SKYE

(blurts out)

From Jewish Folk Poetry.

JERRY

Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys.

Hey!!

JUDY

(she's up; turns to him, zeig

heil's him)

Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?

JERRY

Well it's fucking time.

TIME CUT TO:

JERRY (CONT'D)

(shouting guesses)

Walk.  Cripple.  Limp.  Ankle.  Second

syllable.  Second syllable.  Move on to

the fucking second syllable.

JERRY (CONT'D)

(sings out)

The clock is ticking!

MAC

Time.

TIME CUT TO:

SALLY'S TEAM

(unison)

Quote.  Play.

SOPHIA

Oh shit.  It's one of Cal's.  Obscure

Shakespeare, folks.

SOPHIA (CONT'D)

(calls over to him)

Maybe something original for a change.

SALLY'S TEAM

(in unison)

Ten...twenty...thirty...seven, eight.

Thirty-eighth word...thirty-seventh word.

SALLY

(to Joe's look; innocence)

I didn't say a word.

MAC

Time!

JERRY

What was it?  What the fuck was it?

SALLY

(small grin)

Ryan's novel.

JERRY

Ryan's novel?

JUDY

Ryan's novel, Jerry.

AMERICA

(sings out)

Dinner!

SALLY

Still champions.

JOE

Panes is not on your team anymore.

PANES

What did I do?

SALLY

Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll

have Panes if I like.

AMERICA

Dinner.

SALLY

Dinner.

JOE

It's an unfair advantage.

SALLY

You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've

got Skye?  We're the leftovers.

JOE

Okay, knock it off.

SALLY

Truce?

JOE

Truce.

SALLY

Dinner.

(on the move)

Don't be angry.

JOE

(pissed)

I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.

EXT. POOL AREA - MAGIC HOUR

ASTRID

(barely looks up as Sally comes

into the room)

So who won?

SALLY

(raises her hand)

A triumph.  When did you get here?

ASTRID

Ten, fifteen minutes ago.

SALLY

Why didn't you come in?

ASTRID

I hate the sight of blood.  You guys

don't take prisoners.

SKYE

(charmed by the bundle in

Astrid's arm)

Oh how sweet.

ASTRID

She's insanely jealous.

CLAIR

That's revolting, Astrid.

PANES

Is there space here?

SKYE

Yes.

PANES

Do you need anything else?

SKYE

No, no thanks.

PANES

(finally)

I was impressed.

SKYE

Oh?

PANES

The charades.

SKYE

Thank you.

PANES

That was my clue.

SKYE

Oh?

PANES

The Shostakovich.

SKYE

Really??

PANES

(does Seller's Indian)

Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you

see.

PANES (CONT'D)

(still Indian)

So you are well acquainted with this

Shostackovich, as am I.

JOE

I hate the idea of some one else living

in it.

JOE (CONT'D)

Sally's never even seen it.  I thought

we'd raise our kids there.

JOE (CONT'D)

Have I ever told you how Lucy and I

nearly squashed each other getting into

the dumb waiter.

GINA/JEFFREY/SALLY

Yes./Often./I stopped counting.

JOE

The dumb waiter was our...

GINA

Escape hatch.

JOE

(eyes her)

Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go

about the garden.  Something was

misplanted...

SALLY

Not properly watered.

JOE

Whatever!

(to Gina)

You know how he gets.  Well, he went

absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were

frantically trying to scramble into the

dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more.

It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear

friends, is the day...

SALLY/JEFFREY

I realized I had become a man.  Ta da!

GINA

You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy.

JOE

(childishly)

So?

GINA

(laughs)

I love you, Joe Therrian.

SALLY

(at a loss, small)

Me too.

ASTRID

You're not upset that I brought the dog?

SALLY

Would it make a difference?

ASTRID

Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More

like a small person.  So is there anyone

here for me?  No one looks new.

(fixes on Ryan)

Who's that?

SALLY

You don't want that.  It's married and

it's the neighbor.

ASTRID

Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage

part working out?

SALLY

You're fucking desperate.

ASTRID

Like you didn't know.

(re: Skye)

Who invited the bimbo?

SALLY

One guess.

SOPHIA

(re: the cake as it comes in)

Part of our gift.  Honey!!

CAL

(clinks his glass)

Here, here.

SKYE

I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm

honored to be a part of tonight.  To be

in the same room, with my favorite living

actress...

SAM

(sings out)

Still living.

SKYE

And my favorite novelist.  And all their

amazing --

SAM

(sings out)

And talented.

SKYE

Friends.  And talented friends.  This

room is so filled with love..

ASTRID

(sings out)

And the winner is...

PANES

Let the woman speak.

SKYE

And I brought a gift of love.  A gift

that is love.

SKYE (CONT'D)

(tears up)

Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making

me a part of it.

SALLY

(pours the pills into her hand)

What are they?

JOE

(pleased, surprised)

Dolphins.  Great.

SALLY

It's ecstasy, Sal.

SKYE

I think there are sixteen there.

JOE

(kisses Skye)

This is an amazing present.  What a

sweetheart you are.

SALLY

(regards Joe; to Skye)

What a sweetheart you are.

ASTRID

(Anouk still in her lap)

It's late.

(kisses Anouk)

You sleepy baby?

JOE

I think we should all take it tonight.

Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving.

That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae.

You're going to have a fabulous time.

SALLY

I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very

worried about my brain and my spine.

SOPHIA

(laughs)

Oh honey, you're gonna love it.

JOE

(to her Look)

Sophia's going to do it, Panes is going

to do it, trust me.

CAL

(on seeing America, bursts

into)

America, America God shed his light on

me.

MONICA

(his glare; simply)

I want to try it, Ryan.

MONICA

I love it here.  Don't you love it here,

Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love

tonight.  And I love these people.  And

this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.

(touches her own cheek, ever so

lightly; shivers against the

sensation)

Utterly fantastic.

RYAN

You know what Sally Therrian was saying

about your spine and your brain?  She

didn't pull that out of thin air.  It

causes brain damage.  You'd better drink

a lot of water.

MONICA

Do you want to go home, Ryan?

RYAN

Yes.

MONICA

I think you should then.  You should look

in on Sheila.

RYAN

I'm not going to leave you alone.

MONICA

They're really nice people, Ryan.

They're like us...

RYAN

They're nothing like us.

MONICA

I think you need to speak for yourself,

Ryan.  But I think you're really nice

people...

RYAN

Are you making an ass of yourself?

MONICA

There's only you, Ryan.  You know what,

Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so

much... You need...

RYAN

I don't need a drug.

MONICA

You need a good review and you'll be

fine.  The whole color of the world will

change, mark my words.

RYAN

Ready to go?

MONICA

I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do

know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you

mustn't worry.

(turns back)

Ryan, you're a great man.

CLAIR

This water is great!

JERRY

(swimming past her)

Wanna dive for a baton?

JUDY

Okay, I'm about to throw five colored

batons in the water.  Then I'm going to

count to three, and then you may start

diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is

ten extra points.  Ready?

(she throws batons in)

One, two, three, go!!

CUT TO:

MAC

You got your DP?

JOE

What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They

gave me a list.

MAC

And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big

leagues for a first timer.  Do you even

like movies?

JOE

Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God

I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet,

Mac?

MAC

Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver

Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're

friends.  And great DP's I could give

them a call for you.

JOE

Thanks, Mac.

(regards him)

And thanks for being so supportive about

all this.

(throws arm around him, hugs

him close)

I really love you, you know.

MAC

Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything

I can do.

JOE

(lets go of Mac)

God, I really need to jump about a bit.

(begins jumping)

How's your film going?

CAL

It's going.  It's going.

JOE

And how's the diva doing?

MAC

Well, you know...good days, bad days.

JOE

I meant Sally.

MAC

I meant Sally.

JOE

(stops jumping, studies him)

Oh.  You're serious.

MAC

(throws and arm around him)

No.  No.

(a beat)

Let me tell you something.  Directing's

the best preparation possible for

fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.

JOE

Oh don't.  Everyone says that.

SALLY

(re: the photograph)

Isn't this a fabulous picture?

SOPHIA

Yes.

SALLY

She's such a great photographer.

SOPHIA

Hm.

SALLY

So where should I put it?

SOPHIA

I thought it was okay where it was.

SALLY

It's much more personal in here.

SOPHIA

A notch above the storage room.

SALLY

We're always in here.

(regards the photo)

She really gets him, doesn't she?

SOPHIA

The both of you.

SALLY

But she really gets to the heart of Joe,

doesn't she?  She's a genius.

SOPHIA

So how much do you hate her?

SALLY

Big time.

SOPHIA

Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.

SALLY

She took our wedding photos, for

chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.

SOPHIA

(a moment simply)

I trust you.

SALLY

Oh Soph...

SOPHIA

You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and

miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally.

It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors.

Terrible plumbing.

SALLY

And the food sucks, I know.

SOPHIA

You are not having your baby in London.

You're going to have your baby at Cedars

in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by

Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period.

And you're getting that epidural right

away, don't let anyone talk you into any

of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no

excuse for pain like that.

SALLY

Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!

SOPHIA

Well good.  Thank God.

SALLY

Let's go in the kitchen and spy on

everyone.

SOPHIA

Oh honey, let's.

SALLY

(stops short; turns to her)

What do you mean, thank God?

SOPHIA

Well, are you sure about this baby thing?

It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?

SALLY

No, no, not at all... I mean I've still

got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I

still have a good six years, whatever.

We could have three kids yet, if we

wanted.  And I know I've always said I

never wanted kids, and I didn't... but

this year, I really, truly, feel ready...

SOPHIA

Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You

are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an

issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on

the other hand, is a different story.

SALLY

(laughs)

Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids.

Joe thinks he needs kids.

SOPHIA

He wants playmates.  Oh he's a

sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him.

But he's not going to be a good father.

He's just not parenting material.

SALLY

Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels

really nice against your skin.

SOPHIA

Don't try and change the subject.

(sitting, joining Sally)

Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a

little narcissistic, irresponsible and

unreliable.

SALLY

And Cal's this massive adult?

SOPHIA

Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how

happy Joe was when the drugs came out

tonight?

SALLY

You weren't exactly horrified.

SOPHIA

(laughing)

I don't have a drug problem.

SALLY

Neither does Joe.

SOPHIA

His sister does.  Big time.  And the New

York Times says addiction is genetic --

I'll e-mail you the article.

SOPHIA (CONT'D)

You don't have kids to keep a marriage

together, Sally.  It's only five months

since Joe came back.

SALLY

(getting up)

We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a

baby and we're moving to London.

SOPHIA

(following her)

Well, you weren't fine last summer when

you went Sylvia Plath on me in

Connecticut.

SALLY

Not nice.  Not kind.

SOPHIA

Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband

was in his portrayal of you in his novel.

SALLY

Why are you doing this?

SOPHIA

His image of you is a possessive, fragile

neurotic.

SALLY

(tearing up)

But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.

SOPHIA

(also tearing up)

No you are not.  You're Sally Nash.

Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're

my best friend and I love you more than

anyone, and you're not going to move to

London to have the offspring of a

sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now

I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..."

English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's

probably going to leave you for Skye

Davidson anyway.

SOPHIA (CONT'D)

He's always one step removed, always

looking over his shoulder always looking

for something else, something more

intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I

love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's

not ready.

(a choked sob, tears well and

fall)

Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have

kids.  You can't stick your head in the

oven.  You can't take a handful of

Percoden if you want to, or slit your

wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids

rob you of that option.  Trust me.

(a beat)

Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really

good.

JOE

Isn't Skye amazing?

CAL

She's got great tits.

JOE

She's a constant surprise.

CAL

And you've only just met.

JOE

Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty

seven and...

(taps his head)

The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew

that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

CAL

Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

JOE

Yeah, God she really does have great

tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work

with her.

CAL

The camera loves her.  A great actress.

JOE

With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if

I can touch them.

CLAIR

Has anyone seen Mac?

JOE

(pointing further up the

property)

I saw him wandering over there, I think.

How're you feeling, Clair?

CLAIR

I'm so good.

CAL

Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle.

I'm sure Sally's told you.

JOE

No, what?

CAL

The movie.

JOE

Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think.

Is Mac okay?

CAL

I don't know what's going on.  I don't

care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy.

She isn't there, that's all.  She's no

idea what she's playing, not a clue.

JOE

Who, Sally?

CAL

And, you know it isn't rocket science,

this script.  She can barely get the

lines out.  There was a scene last week -

she sobbed, through every take.  I know

crying's easy for her but it's a fucking

comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You

know, that thing that was Sally - that

always surprised you.  It's gone.  I

think she's scared.  And that's death.

JOE

I still think she sails above the rest.

I mean not like her early films.  But

those were all such great directors.

CAL

Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's

a woman's director.  And nothing's

happening.  Course he won't fire her,

because of the friendship... But it was

discussed.  He had to battle his studio

to get her in the first place.

JOE

What?

CAL

Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's

best friend.

(to Joe's stare)

I never said any of this, alright.  I'll

deny it on the stand...

(into the silence)

You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so

great.  Maybe that's what this is all

about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this

anymore.  You know adults don't do this

for a living.  You guys are gonna have

your kids, you'll be directing -- one

asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia

knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair.

Clair's a mess.

(throws an arm around him)

Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget

that natural childbirth shit.

Everything's going to be what it's

supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking

shadow.  A poor player who struts and

frets his hour upon the stage and then is

heard no more..." And speaking of me, the

role of Leo in your film?

JOE

(stares at him)

Leo?

CAL

Any thoughts on casting yet?

JOE

(regards him)

Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude

passed.

CAL

Well, I can't make any promises, and of

course I haven't read the script but I

loved the novel...when are you shooting?

JOE

October-ish.

CAL

I have a small window of time.

JOE

Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.

CAL

Scratch the two, write in a four.

JOE

Scratch the two, write in a four.

CAL

You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty

nine.

JOE

Five years ago, I was at the party,

remember?

SALLY (O.S.)

Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing.

CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)

You sing like a bird.

SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)

A bird with dropsy.  A caged bird.  That

hasn't long to live.

CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S)

You seem so alive up there.

SALLY (ON TV)

I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged

for sometime.  Funny, huh?

MAC

(moans)

No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)

It's preposterous.  You're free to do

whatever you like.

SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V.

Yes, well, we'll see won't we?

MAC (O.S.)

Jesus Christ.

SALLY

(a deep breath)

Well...wow...

CLAIR

Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you

doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you

feel breezy.

MAC

I'm in mourning.

CLAIR

You can cut around it, whatever it is.

You always do.

MAC

Not this time.

CLAIR

It's always not this time.  If you can do

it around me, you can do it around

anyone.

MAC

(an observation)

You don't have any clothes on.

CLAIR

How nice for everybody.  Come swimming.

The water's glorious.

(re: the film)

You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one

of your brilliant ideas.

MAC

Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out

of my depth.

CLAIR

Things always look much worse in the

morning.

MAC

I don't know how to make her funny.

CLAIR

You're coming swimming in the pool, and

in a few minutes you won't even remember

what it's about.  You won't care who's in

your damn movie.

MAC

(really stoned)

What what's about?

CLAIR

I...wait, what are you talking about?

JOE

Are you okay?

MONICA

I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit

funny.

JOE

Let's go for a walk.

MONICA

I've never done this before.

JOE

Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in

front of the other... That's a good girl.

MONICA

I'm a little in the puke zone.

JOE

(giving her some water)

Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.

(puts the bottle in her hand)

Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths.

Nice and slow.

(sits her down; produces a

lollipop)

Would you like a lolly?

MONICA

What am I, five?

JOE

You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm

having one.

MONICA

(a grin)

Okay.

JOE

Lemon or raspberry?

MONICA

Lemon.

JOE

Lemon it is.

MONICA

(finally)

Ryan's really angry with me.

JOE

I think he's really angry with me too.

MONICA

(laughs)

It's really not the same thing.

(a moment)

He was really nicer when he drank.

JOE

I'm sorry.

MONICA

Eight years, though.  That's quite an

accomplishment.

JOE

That's a lot of those.

MONICA

Medallions.

JOE

A lot of cakes.

MONICA

Yes.

JOE

And he doesn't smoke?

MONICA

He has to find non-smoker's meetings that

used to be almost impossible, you know?

It's gotten much better.

JOE

How long have you been married?

MONICA

Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just

about.

JOE

You must have been a baby.

MONICA

Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.

(a moment)

I'm cold.

JOE

Come here.

MONICA

(a moment)

That's very nice.

JOE

I like you.

MONICA

I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that

passage in your book.  The bit about us

running into each other in the movie

theatre.

JOE

Sorry?

MONICA

I know you changed it to a bookstore.

And the color of my hair.  But the moment

was exactly the same.  The same, you

know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim,

wasn't it?

JOE

(humors her)

Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's

sacred.

(thinks a moment)

No, nothing at all.

MONICA

I think it's great that I made an

impression at all, you know.

SALLY (O.S.)

Otis!!  Otis, come!  Oh fuck!

SALLY (CONT'D)

Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis

got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came

out of the house and the fucking gate was

wide open.

JOE

Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that

gate.

MONICA

(horrified)

I'm sorry.

SALLY

(raging)

There's a goddamn sign on the gate.

MONICA

I'm so sorry.

SALLY

You fucking cow, can't you read?!

MONICA

(at a loss)

I...

SALLY

How long ago was it?

JOE

Stop being such a bitch, Sal.

MONICA

I'm so sorry.

JOE

It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to

do in Otis.

SALLY

Don't be so sure.

JOE

Listen to yourself...

(to Monica)

Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find

him.

(to Sally)

What's wrong with you?

SALLY

(re: Monica)

She left the fucking gate open.

JOE

Well he can't have gone far.

SALLY

Can't have gone far?  He's like a

greyhound.  He could be miles away.

JOE

He'll find his way back.

SALLY

There are fucking coyotes out there.

JOE

(calming)

Sally, calm down.  We're not going to

find him any quicker by you being

hysterical.

SALLY

Fuck you.

JOE

Or shitty!!  Otis!!

CUT TO:

RYAN

How long have you worked for the

Therrians?

AMERICA

(shrugs, polite but annoyed)

A long time.

RYAN

So you were here when they were doing the

work on the boundary fence?

AMERICA

Oh yes.

RYAN

Did you know the contractor?

AMERICA

Very well.

RYAN

Was it a contractor?

AMERICA

It's the way they do things.

RYAN

To code?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Did you see permits?  Did he have a

license?

AMERICA

You should talk to Mr. Joe.

MONICA

Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to

help me find the dog!  I let their dog

out.  We need to find the dog.

RYAN

You're not serious.

MONICA

I left the gate open and Otis got out!

He could get hit by a car!

RYAN

God willing.

MONICA

We have to find the dog, Ryan.

RYAN

Why?

MONICA

(regards him)

Because we're nice people, and because

what goes around comes around.

(desperate)

Because, God help you if something

happens to that dog?

RYAN

Excuse me?

MONICA

All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the

only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.

(a beat)

They've gone to the canyon, we should go

towards the PCH.

PANES

Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the

Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed

under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.

SKYE

Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis,

come!!

PANES

Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know

about Andre Zhdanov?

SKYE

Who doesn't know about the infamous

composer's conference of 1948 where

Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet

Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and

Myaskovsky.

PANES

I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute

girls don't know.

SKYE

Do Peter Sellers again.

PANES

(a la Sellers)

Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this

God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very

hungry.

SKYE

I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I

played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who

gets shot in the head, and they used

Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.

PANES

Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!

SKYE

Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of

research.

PANES

Do you really, you really, like

Shostakovich?

SKYE

Yeah.

PANES

Would you, like, marry him?

SKYE

If he were still alive, maybe.

PANES

How about someone who really really liked

Shostakovich?

SKYE

(smiling)

Are you asking me to marry you?

PANES

No, I'm just testing to see how deeply

perverted and impulsive you are.

SKYE

(laughing)

Very.

PANES

Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really

twenty-two?

SKYE

Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...

(lops off two years)

Five.

SALLY

Otis!!!!

JOE

(on her heels)

Otis!!!!

SALLY

Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh

my god, oh my god.

JOE

This is a nightmare.  We should have kept

him upstairs.

SALLY

It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to

bed, America brought Otis in the room and

closed the door.  It was done.

JOE

Well someone clearly let him out before

Monica opened the gate.

SALLY

Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're

at it.  But I guess that's what I

interrupted.

JOE

Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle.

The only person who's ever taken ecstacy

and become angrier.

SALLY

Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to

be rather an expert.  I don't remember in

the last five months of counselling your

ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage

parties.

JOE

Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you

would think it was called rage.  Perfect!

SALLY

What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's

get really clear here.

JOE

Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out

dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I

was about splitting up with you.  I

haven't lied to you.  I told you about

the people I've slept with.  I just

didn't mention the few occasions I took

drugs because you're so fucking

judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end

of it, and you have so little faith and

so little trust in me.  Sally, we're

back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please

let's not do this.

SALLY

Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!

JOE

Otis!

SALLY

I'm not sure we understand that word in

the same way.

JOE

Love?

SALLY

You walked out on a five year marriage.

JOE

That hasn't the first fucking thing to do

with love.  It's whether we can live

together... like this!  All the time.

SALLY

It's not like this all the time.

JOE

DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to

be with you for the rest of my natural

life?  I'm trying.

SALLY

And how hard it hit?

JOE

Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been

through this.

SALLY

You've been through it.  That's how you

love people.  When it's easy for you,

when it's convenient for you.

JOE

Sally, first of all, you're talking

bullshit.  And second...

SALLY

You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy

called you three times this week.  She's

a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a

fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to

her more than you do.

JOE

That is not true.

SALLY

It is true.  You know how you love, Joe?

You dedicate a book to someone.

JOE

Every novel I've had published in every

language I've dedicated to Lucy.

SALLY

Right.  And when was the last time you

spoke to her?

SALLY (CONT'D)

And how fucking dare you cast Skye

Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea

how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an

actress!  It's about our marriage for

fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...

JOE

It's a novel.

SALLY

About me!

JOE

Who the fuck do you think you are?  The

part of Genna is not just about you.

It's about every woman I've ever loved in

my entire life.  Including my mother.

The character is also clearly in her

early twenties, Sally.

SALLY

What are you saying?

JOE

Hello?  Last birthday was?

SALLY

I don't look my age, Joe.

JOE

Sally, I have never considered you for

this part because you are too old to play

it.  And you are out of touch with

reality if you think differently.

SALLY

It's a shit novel anyway.

JOE

Well there you go.  I let you off the

hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.

SALLY

Not really.  I mean your books have

always been pop, but this is the

shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all

our friends think, anyway.

JOE

Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle,

stripped ten years off your face, still

couldn't have got the thing made.

Because I don't mean anything as a

director, and your name doesn't mean fuck

all anymore.  And the people that can

hire you are afraid to, because they

think you're phoning it in.  That you

don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.

SALLY

Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?

JOE

Your director and your co-star of your

current movie.  Don't dish if you can't

take it, Sally.

SALLY

Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?

SALLY (CONT'D)

Cal, too?

JOE

Sally, for Christ's sake.

SALLY

Anyone else?

JOE

This is insanity.

(moves toward her)

Sally...

SALLY

Don't.

JOE

Don't push me away.

SALLY

I had an abortion two weeks ago.

JOE

Don't do this.

SALLY

I found out I was pregnant and it scared

the shit out of me.

JOE

(threatens)

Don't do this!

SALLY

I told you when we met I never wanted

children.  I don't want kids in my life.

We talked about it.  You weren't

listening.

JOE

You changed your mind.

SALLY

I wanted you back.

SALLY (CONT'D)

You think this was to hurt you?!  My God,

Joe.  It isn't about you.

JOE

What?!  You aborted our child?!

SALLY

I'm a monster.  Exactly.

JOE

You're not ready.

SALLY

Don't make allowances.  I'll never be

ready.  Some people just shouldn't have

children.  I'd be a terrible fucking

mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But

I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I

can do it.

JOE

I wasn't part of that picture at all, was

I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did

I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking

farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long

did you think you could keep it going.

You're amazing.  Do you have any idea

what you've done to us?

SALLY

Yes.

JOE

I'll never forgive you.

SALLY

I know.

JOE

I have no idea who you are.

CLAIR

Oh my God.  Honey???

JERRY

He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a

little room?

MAC

(his face against concrete)

Man, I must really be stoned.

(wipes tears from his face with

his hand)

Thanks, buddy.

CLAIR

Honey?

MAC

I'm fine, babe.

JERRY

Give him a minute, Clair.

MAC

(humiliated)

Hey.

(looks over at Jerry)

Thanks, buddy.

JERRY

Anytime, sport.

MAC

(wants to say "don't call me

sport")

Yeah, thanks pal.

CLAIR

(helpless)

Honey?

MAC

I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little

walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it.

My life didn't pass in front of my eyes.

So, it probably wasn't that close.

JERRY

Probably not.

MAC

(to Jerry)

So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?

JUDY

There's a test, you know.

JERRY

(embarrassed)

Forget it, Judy.

CLAIR

(still scared)

Honey?

MAC

I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a

minute.

MAC

(paces; at himself)

You're okay.  Buck up.  Come on, be a

man.  It could happen to anybody.

(tears start again)

If you don't stop, I'm going to punch

your face in.

(another moment)

MAC (CONT'D)

Oh shit.  I can't fucking do anything

right.  Come on, come on.  Oh thank you

God for giving me this chance.  Thank you

for having Jerry here to save me.  I

promise I will never cheat on my wife

again.  I will never take drugs again,

and I will be a great fucking husband and

a loving father.  I am a great father!  I

have terrific friends.  I am a brilliant

director.  Well-respected.  I won a

Golden Globe, how 'bout that?  Yeah, man,

it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.

And God, I will be humble.

MAN'S VOICE

Joe, Joe!  It's your Dad!  Pick up,

Joe...

GINA

(picks up receiver)

Harry, hi, it's Gina!  Gina.  Is

everything alright?

(a deep intake of breath)

Oh my God.  When?  He's not here.

They're out looking for Otis.  The dog,

Harry.

(tears start down her face)

I love you so much.  Lucy's a fighter,

she'll make it.  Whether she wants to or

not.  Harry.  I'm so sorry.  I will.

(writes down the number)

Yes I will.  Take care, Harry.  Bye.

JUDY

Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my

brave hero?

JERRY

You're crazy baby.  I love you.

JUDY

Are you my big hard hero?

JERRY

Do you want me to save you?  Do you want

me to save you?

JUDY

Oh yeah...

JERRY

Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.

JUDY

Oh yeah?

JERRY

Let me heal you, baby.

JUDY

(mantra)

Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.

JERRY

Oh yeah.

SOPHIA

...no, no, start again.

CAL AND SOPHIA

One, two, three, four...

CLAIR

I've lost my husband and my beeper.  Have

either of you seen either of them?

JOE

What is it?

GINA

Let's go upstairs, okay?

GINA (CONT'D)

Let's go upstairs.

SALLY

(on the way upstairs)

Is it Otis?

SKYE

What happened?

JOE

The suspense is killing me.

GINA

Harry called.

JOE

(growing dread)

And?

GINA

(there's now way to say it)

Lucy overdosed.

JOE

(a long moment)

But she's alright.

GINA

She's in ICU.

JOE

(laughs; shakes his head)

Stupid tart.

GINA

She left a note.

JOE

(realizes the import; to Gina)

Fuck you.

GINA

You need to call your dad.

JOE

Leave us alone right now.

GINA

I've booked you a flight and packed you a

bag.  You just need to get into a car and

go.

SALLY

Would you leave us alone right now?

GINA

I love her too, Joe.

JOE

Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble.

So will you leave Sally and me alone

right now?

SALLY

(a shrug; simply)

Everybody hates the messenger.

SALLY (CONT'D)

(to Joe)

I'm coming with you.

JOE

(inconsolable)

I don't want you to go.

JOE (CONT'D)

I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be

on a plane on my own tonight.

SALLY

I'll be with you.

JOE

I don't want to go tonight.

SALLY

You don't have to.

JOE

(bereft)

Stupid tart.

MAC

How's he doing?

SALLY

Not good.

GINA

He's gonna miss his flight.

SALLY

Yeah.

GINA

Is he not going?  I booked a flight.

SALLY

He's not going tonight.

GINA

I told his father he'd be on that flight.

SALLY

Well you could tell him otherwise.  It

was good of you to be all this help.  But

he doesn't want to go tonight.

GINA

Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.

SALLY

And you're not the wife.

GINA

It's not a contest.

SALLY

Damn straight.

CAL

Should I go up?

SALLY

I don't think so.

CAL

You want us to stay?

SALLY

Maybe not.

MAC

So much for ecstacy, right?

SOPHIA

Let's get the kids.

CLAIR

Oh my God, the sitter.

SALLY

(laughs)

Oh Clair, you're so... You know.  You

just put things in perspective.

JOE

(dials phone, a moment)

Hey, Dad...

SOPHIA

I'm going to be home all weekend, call if

you need anything.

CAL

Hang in.

SALLY

(resigned)

Oh perfect!

JERRY

I call that a perfect day.

JUDY

A perfect night.

JERRY

Damn near.

(long moment)

And a damn near perfect drug.

JUDY

Hm.  We should do it again.

JERRY

Just every once in a blue moon, you know.

JUDY

Hm.

(a long moment)

You think we should ask them for their

landscaper?

JERRY

Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?

JUDY

Not as a rule.

JERRY

(a long moment)

They didn't sign their goddamn tax

returns!

GINA

(kisses Sally; whispers)

Take good care of it.

SALLY

Count on it.

RYAN

(appalled)

Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!

MONICA

(regards them)

Don't go in, Ryan.

RYAN

What?

MONICA

Let's just go home, okay?

PANES

Coffee?

JOE

Sure.

PANES

I'll do it.

SALLY

You don't need to do that.

SKYE

I don't mind...

SALLY

Relax.  You've done enough.

JOE

Can I come in?

SALLY

Sure.

OE

My plane leaves in a few hours.

SALLY

Okay.  Do you want me to come with you?

JOE

(simply)

No.

SALLY

Okay.

JOE

(a moment)

Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't

it?

SALLY

I guess.

JOE

Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I

don't understand you.  And I don't think

I ever understood Lucy.  I don't

understand throwing it away.  How do you

throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want

it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I

want the possibilities.  And all kinds of

crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit.

And I think that's okay with me because,

because of the rest of the stuff.  All

the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's

a fucking miracle when you come down to

it.

(a moment)

We'd have had amazing children, you and

me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have

surprised yourself.

(regards her)

I'll never love anybody else, you know.

SALLY

(a little choked laugh)

Me too.

JOE

That's under lock and key.

SALLY

Me too.

JOE

Happy anniversary.

SALLY

It's a Calder.

JOE

I know.

SALLY

He's my favorite.

JOE

I know.  It's for the baby's crib.

SALLY

Ah...

SALLY (CONT'D)

They're the keys to your grandad's flat.

Happy anniversary, baby.

JOE

Oh, Sally Mae...

SALLY

I know.

JOE

Will you make love with me?

SALLY

Sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT.
