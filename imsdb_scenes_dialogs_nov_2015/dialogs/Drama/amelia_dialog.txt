EXT. BAR, LAE, NEW GUINEA - DAY

CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN.

A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the-

art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting.

PULL BACK to see...

...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-

sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And

peering down through the mist and rain...

...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane.

Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray

eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her.

Something fierce lives there.

SUPERIMPOSE:   LAE, NEW GUINEA - 1937.

FRED (O.S.)

Sure I can't talk you inta

somethin' more adventurous?

She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome

in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt-

streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a

Coke which he sets down for her.

AMELIA

Adventurous? You've got the wrong

girl, Mister. You should know that

by now.

Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself

four fingers.

FRED

Actually. I knew that the moment I

met ol' George.

He sips his drink.    She says nothing.

FRED (CONT'D)

I like how you don't talk about

him.

AMELIA

That why I get so many chances to

not do it?

FRED

Well.   Natural curiosity.

His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila.

She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her

side of the table.

2.

FRED

I mean, why would a guy who needs

to run the show. Pick the one girl

he knew could kick his tail?

No response.   Just her clear direct gaze.

FRED (CONT'D)

I'll bet he knew that. First time

he met you.

She looks out to sea.

AMELIA

He thought I hated him.      He never

knew I was fascinated.

INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

2                                                                  2

Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully

built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once

strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now,

there are none to be seen. Even as...

...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits

respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad.

Does he know she's there?

SUPERIMPOSE:   NEW YORK, LATER 1937.

GEORGE

(without turning)

The first time I met her she sat

in that chair.

The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And

still with his back to her...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You may as well write it down,

Mary. Write it all down. Even the

parts that are confused or

graceless or boring.

He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

We'll see if I remember how to

edit.

She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of

being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...

3.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'd kept her waiting two hours.

T

She hated me on sight, but she

hought I couldn't tell.

His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one

object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a

green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

She was a person who cherished her

privacy and was devoting her life

to social work. And there I was...

His smile is kind.   And honestly self-mocking.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the

glory of my authors and celebrity

acquaintances. A vain, fast-

talking, manipulator. But then I

guess you know all that, don't you?

She looks up reproachfully.   Nothing of the kind, and you

know it.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Oh, yes. And the kind of man who

fishes for compliments.

He's made her laugh.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

She is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the

center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come

and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring

through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an

exam.

SUPERIMPOSE:   G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928.

GEORGE (V.O.)

The waiting made her furious.

She undoubtedly felt I was

E

stablishing my dominance and

importance.

She doesn't look furious at all. Thumbing through WE by COL.

CHARLES LINDBERGH. Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St.

Louis in Paris.

4.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Actually, I hadn't given her a

thought. Oblivious as usual.

Which, perhaps, was even worse.

Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer

preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd

with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.

AMELIA (V.O.)

I figured he'd be pompous.

Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers,

explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of

George with the great Lindbergh.

A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises,

smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down

the corridor.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I knew, of course, that he wasn't

going to choose me. I had no

discernible qualifications

whatsoever.

They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER

PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly

pushes it open...

...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and

suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him,

negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of

messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric,

masterful.

AMELIA (V.O)

But to be rejected by this...

parasite. A man who had given up

any life of his own to flutter near

the famous.

He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is

there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I didn't know whether to laugh or

throw something at the jerk.

He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't

move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze

from him. He hangs up the phone.

They stare at each other for a frozen beat.   He breaks the

moment with a charming smile...

5.

GEORGE

Miss Earhart?

AMELIA

Mr. Putnam?

GEORGE (softly)

I asked you to sit.

AMELIA

Was that the thing you did with

your hand? Sadly, I don't speak

dog.

His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine.

GEORGE

A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like.

melia sits.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'm told you want to fly the

Atlantic Ocean.

AMELIA

I do.

GEORGE

In the 12 months since Lindbergh,

55 people in 18 planes have tried.

Three planes made it. Fourteen

people have died.

AMELIA

I'll make it.

GEORGE

Three women died trying. Two

others escaped with their lives.

If you do make it, you'd be the

first. Which...is the real

attraction for both of us, I

suspect.

She nods.    No smile.

AMELIA

Always nice to know what the real

attraction is.

His smile.    Beginning to enjoy this conversation.

6.

GEORGE

The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd

by Amy Guest, a socialite who

wanted the record for herself. Her

family wouldn't tolerate the

danger. She has asked for a

replacement...

He gestures.   Perhaps you.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

...who is American, educated, well-

spoken, a flyer, preferably

physically attractive...

AMELIA

Why would that matter?

GEORGE

Because she wants the world to pay

attention. And pretty girls

command more attention.

AMELIA

Was that your advice?

GEORGE

Sure. My role is selling this

event to the public. There will be

a contract for the girl's story

with the New York Times. Also a

book to be published over her name.

Understood...?       G

EORGE (CONT'D)

But all the money from these will

go to Mrs. Guest.

AMELIA

Except for the part that goes to

you.

GEORGE

Which will be as great as I can

manage, I assure you.

AMELIA

You said she wants a flyer.

GEORGE

Don't get your hopes up. The

celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be

the pilot. There'll be a male co-

pilot and navigator. The woman

will be purely a passenger.

7.

He waits for reaction.   She keeps her mouth shut.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

That's good for your chances.

Because your level of flying

experience wouldn't place you

anywhere near the group that would

be considered for this. If the

woman were to do any flying at all.

No punches pulled.   Not his style.

AMELIA

Why would anyone want a book from a

passenger?

GEORGE

Because the hook is that we're

making the woman the commander.

The pilot will sign a contract

saying he is under her direction

and control. It's her ship, her

flight.

AMELIA

Good for my chances, you said.

What are my chan...

GEORGE

The job's yours.

She blinks.   Stunned speechless.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I chose you the moment you walked

through the door.

He smiles his charming smile.    Several phones are RINGING.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Now assuming my awful manners

haven't soured you on the

enterprise. May I give you a lift

to the station?

Amelia rises.   Is she pissed at being toyed with?

AMELIA

You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I

can find my way.

The look holds.   He shrugs.   You probably can.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - LATER

Two figures on the platform.   Her train is ready to leave.

GEORGE

I honestly feel an apology is in

order.

AMELIA

Fine.   What have I done?

She watches his smile.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

I didn't mind waiting. Caught up

on my reading. Knitted a sweater.

GEORGE

I mean an apology.   For what's

coming.

His voice softens.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I'm going to be pretty controlling

these next few months. How you

dress, move, cut your hair. Speak

in public. It's all part of the

package we're selling.

AMELIA

We.

GEORGE

That's right. If you're not in

there selling with me, it won't

work.

The smile turns friendly.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You're the star. I'm no one at

all.

AMELIA

Spoken like a gentleman.

She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man.

He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches

his cheery wave as she rolls away.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Of course a gentleman. Would have

paid for my ticket.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

Gazing out the window as she rattles toward Boston. She

looks down now to a notebook in her lap. As she flips pages,

we see it is a collection of hand-written POEMS and thoughts.

She writes...

AMELIA (V.O.)

Courage is the price that life exacts

For granting peace

We SUPERIMPOSE over her image the wall of a little girl's

bedroom, filled with treasured NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS about

women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had

established themselves in positions previously thought to be

available only to men.

EXT. FIELD, DES MOINES - DAY

Two LITTLE GIRLS, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field.

Amelia and a girlfriend. They stop, hearing...

The DRONING of an engine, a small red plane APPEARING above

the treetops. The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field,

SWOOPS down to BUZZ them. Amelia's friend runs for her life.

But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the

plane...

...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the

slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER,

as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The

aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head.

AMELIA (V.O.)

As the little red airplane passed

by, it said something to me.

Amelia beams.   She fills her lungs, transported.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I don't think I've ever stopped

listening.

HOLD on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze.

SMASH CUT TO...

INT. AMELIA'S PLANE - DAY

Amelia flying her little yellow Kinner.   Feeling the freedom

she thrilled to as a A

child.

MELIA (V.O.)

Ten years, 28 jobs and an unspeak-

able number of crashes later, I

hadn't changed my mind.

She LIFTS the nose of the tiny craft.   Begins to CLIMB.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I even had my own plane. Bought

with my last dime.

At the apex of her climb, she FLIPS into a breathtaking LOOP

THE LOOP, as...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Course in the early days of

flying...

...her engine SPUTTERS. Then STALLS.    The plane DIPS into a

TAIL-SPIN, PLUNGING downward...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...crashing was so common, you

almost forgot it could kill you...

Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane

HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...until it did.

The engine COUGHS to life and at the last second she SWOOPS

harrowingly above the ground to SOAR FREE.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Almost.

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

8                                                                    8

A small HANGAR in a lonely field.   See a group of...

...MECHANICS in their grease-stained jumpsuits. Three big

guys and one little one working on an engine that's been

pulled from Amelia's Kinner. When the little guy comes up

for air...

...he isn't a guy at all.

11.

AMELIA

Got it.   I think.

REALLY STRANGE!

AMELIA

They are, actually.

SAM

And it's a secret.

AMELIA

Has to be. Competition, you know.

Millionaire heiresses, hot shot

girl pilots. If George knew I told

you, he'd have me publicly flogged.

12.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

So long as he could sell tickets.

He's not smiling.

SAM

And no one else knows.

AMELIA

Marion. She's giving me a leave

of absence.

SAM

I would think so. Your name will

be in all the papers, and not just

Boston. Denison House stands to

come in for funding, national

attention.

AMELIA

Specially if I don't make it.

SAM

Don't joke about that.

She wasn't joking at all.

SAM (CONT'D)

You'll make it. And then you'll

have opportunities to work in

aviation. Anywhere you want.

She laughs.

AMELIA

Well, I'll have impressive

credentials as a long-distance

passenger. That's not exactly a

career in aviation.

She looks up at his eyes.

I         AMELIA (CONT'D)

'm not going anywhere, social work

is my life. After all the years of

false starts, I found the thing I'm

meant to do.

Keep walking.   She gives him time to say...

SAM

And where does that leave us?

13.

AMELIA

You do love to look on the dark

side. Whatever did you see in a

sunny character like me?

SAM

It's not as if I'd been putting

pressure on you.

AMELIA

What love means to you. What it

requires. Is the pressure.

SAM

I love you. Is that such a

terrible problem?

AMELIA

The problem is what it's always

been. The problem is me.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll,

about to become the first female to

fly the Atlantic in the wake of

Lindbergh's historic journey,

Okay, boys. I'll take any

questions you wanna throw my way.

AMELIA (V.O.)

George had told me Stultz was Adm.

Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless,

gifted. He drank. But George said

it never affected his work.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

When he said it, I must have had a

funny look. So I just said, `Yeh,

I grew up around a guy like that.'

GEORGE

Boys, I'd like to introduce your

commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.

AMELIA

We felt `commander' was less

grandiose than, say, `empress.'

GEORGE

Say hello to Slim Gordon your

navigator.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

And Bill Stultz here, simply the

most talented pilot working.

15.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got

his plane...

AMELIA

Y

ou mean the Admiral flies on

those?

The pontoons.   She does not seem admiring.

GEORGE

Nope, those are new, personally

suggested by the old man himself.

Bill nods on that.   Sure were.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

This way, if you're forced down

at sea, you can wait for a rescue.

AMELIA

Hmmn.   What does that do to our

fuel?

BILL

Costs us at least 400 gallons.

Don't bother bringing clothes for

Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the

nearest beach in Ireland. Real

lucky.

GEORGE

The Admiral estimates the pontoons

only cut our range by 200 miles.

But Amelia looks to Bill.   That's not really possible is it?

BILL

The Admiral is the Admiral. He

gets to estimate any damn thing he

wants. All we have to do is figure

out how to fly without petrol.

She turns to George with challenging eyes.

BILL (CONT'D)

Don't go blaming the bookseller.

He's been all through this with

Mrs. Guest, but she worships the

Admiral. And it's money that puts

planes in the air.

AMELIA

I wonder if it can keep them up

there. Not that I've ever had

enough to try.

AMELIA

Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth

shut.

GEORGE

What I ought to try. Is listening

to you once in awhile.

e meant that.   And she seems oddly touched.

AMELIA

Careful.    I could get to like it.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for

everything.

GEORGE

(a smile)

Simpkin.

AMELIA

It's in a book. Oh, that's right.

You read the ones you publish.

There's a Beatrix Potter story

about a cat named Simpkin.

AMELIA (V.O.)

He wasn't happy unless he had

several mice, each under a

different teacup. So he could

never become bored.

We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo

of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is

labeled `LUCKY LINDY.'

AMELIA (V.O.)

THe illusion of activity was

essential for him to feel at peace.

The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh

in a different pose.

AMELIA

What are you boys doing over there?

GEORGE

Trying to make you look like a

girl.

George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins

moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to

Lindbergh's angle.

MELIA (V.O.)

I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's

43rd mouse?     Or his 307th.

Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her

hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...

like a girl, the better.

AMELIA

Oh god, is it worth the effort?

He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not.

GEORGE

Wondering who should play you

in the film of all this. I'm

thinking Chaplin.

AMELIA

Valentino's not available?

He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more.

This time, his hands linger.

18.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Two things. One, Chaplin can't

play me because he's perfect for

you. And two, you have company.

GEORGE

Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy

Binney Putnam.

DOROTHY

Great to meet you. George talks

so much about you.

In fact, lately, you're all he

does talk about.

Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding.    It takes a

beat before he can offer...

him.

That registers.

Mabel, are you implying Miss

Earhart used her feminine charms on

your pilot?

MABEL

I don't know, Charlie, I never seen

her. Has she got any?

LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.   She shows them a smoky

smile, but stays on message.

MABEL (CONT'D)

Well, she had to use something on

somebody to get from nowhere to

here. You figure it out, or wait

til George Putnam feeds it to you.

Two dozen questions at once.   She's not even listening.

MABEL (CONT'D)

We're going to Canada, waiting for

some good weather on the Atlantic,

and then we'll kick Little Miss

Whoozis in the keester.

REPORTER

What makes you so cocky that she

won't leave first?

23.

MABEL

Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to

go to China. That thing they're

flying can't load enough gas to

make Yonkers. Tell that to

Putnam's girlie. And while you're

at it...

MABEL (CONT'D)

Tell her I do wear silver.   So I'm

two up on her.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Eleven days of failure for plucky

Amelia Earhart and her crew. If it

isn't storms over the Atlantic,

it's the inability of the

seaplane's pontoons to lift from

the sea.

ERIES OF ANGLES.    One failed take-off after another.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Perhaps it's for the best.

Remember, no woman has beat the

jinx of the Atlantic and three have

died trying. Including a princess

and the niece of former President

Woodrow Wilson.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Maybe this one's not to be. Hey,

Mabel! How's your weather report?

BILL

Christ, what time is...

25.

AMELIA

Time to fly. Get up, get dressed,

we're going now.

She is calm and angry at once.    A powerful combination.   Slim

pulls his pants off a chair.

BILL

Where's the weather report?

She goes to his bed. Hands him a slip of paper.     He blinks,

still waking up. Reads.

BILL (CONT'D)

It's not good enough.

AMELIA

Great. Maybe Mabel will think so,

too. Because if she doesn't, she's

going to Paris and you're going

home. Today.

B

ILL

It's not good enough.

AMELIA

It's fine, there's a tail wind all

the way, we'll off-load to 700

gallons, which gets us off the

water and the wind gets us to

Ireland.

BILL

We've had better than this and we

haven't gone.

AMELIA

But this   is the day Mabel's ready,

so we're   going now. The weather

is going   to get better and we'll

be there   to enjoy it.

BILL

You're serious.

AMELIA

Just as serious as you're hung

over.

(to Slim)

You go now, get the late weather,

we'll meet you at the plane.

Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his

bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his

commander.

26.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(QUIET)

Slim, get out. I've got this.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

I've loved one person

unconditionally, Bill. He is the

most caring and generous and

charming and flat-out funny guy

I'll ever know. He's my father.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

He's a drunk. And he's let me down

all my life.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Now you get out of that bed. And

you fly that god-damned thing to

Ireland. Or I swear to you,

Bill...

AMELIA (CONT'D)

I swear to you I will. Or die

trying.

ou got that?   Do you?

AMELIA (CONT'D)

And either way. You're going to be

living with it.

AMELIA

Good.     Slim, start the engines.

27.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

You signed a contract. You've got

a direct instruction from me to go.

That report indicates some degree

of risk and it's a risk I'm taking.

BILL

Have a nice flight.

AMELIA

Thanks.

SLIM

Hey, I'm scared shitless of this

dame.

AMELIA

Read tomorrow's papers, Bill.

We'll both be in them.

So, to take off, you pull back

but it was worthwhile anyway. You

know that.     I have no faith we'll

meet anywhere again, but I wish we

might.

NINETEEN HOURS PLUS. WE'VE GOT

MAYBE AN HOUR OF PETROL LEFT.

PROBABLY LESS.

She shows him the note and the orange.

AMELIA

WESTERN UNION, SPECIAL DELIVERY.

Bill has to smile. Are you serious? As a heart attack.

Okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked

and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia...

...DROPS the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy

winds CARRY it two hundred yards WIDE of the mark. Our three

stare grimly.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

IF WE LAND NEAR THEM, WE'VE GOT A

RESCUE.

Their eyes are locked.

BILL

THINK THOSE RIDICULOUS SKIS COULD

HOLD US UP IN THIS KIND OF SEA?

She's been wondering the same.

BILL (CONT'D)

YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

ARE YOU A LIAR?

AMELIA

NOT ON THIS OCCASION.

A rare smile...

BILL

WELL, THEN.

And SWOOPS back on course.   Amelia's hand squeezes his

shoulder. DISSOLVE TO...

break up.

FOR DENIAL.

Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there's

fella coming from London. Hilton

Railey.

32.

AMELIA

Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More

important than any of us.

Really?    Yep.

BILL

He says ya mustn't come ashore til

he gets here. No matter what.

Great.    She doesn't like it, but there it is.   She waves, so

long.

BILL (CONT'D)

Some kind of royalty, is he?

She nods.

AMELIA

Public relations.

Goes back to work.    DISSOLVE TO...

LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her

feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of...

...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the

water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her

things.

LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the

Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our

VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring

past him, vaguely apprehensive.

REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN

swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand.

The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were

staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim

help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia

jumps out, the crowd...

.

..begins to soberly APPLAUD, and slowly CLOSES IN around

her. At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand

thrust toward her. She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have

been shunted to the back. Suddenly...

...people get BOLDER. CLAPPING her on the back, reaching to

TOUCH her, someone SNATCHES her scarf, she looks around

frantically for Bill and Slim as...

...a SHERIFF and three DEPUTIES muscle their way to her using

billy clubs to push people back. They surround Amelia, begin

to escort her to the station...

33.

SHERIFF

Sorry Ma'am. Shoulda brought

more men.

AMELIA

No, really, this is very sweet,

it's an honor. I'm actually

enjoying it.

SHERIFF

That's a good thing.

SHERIFF (CONT'D)

Because you're stuck with it.

From here on.

AMELIA

Hullo, Hilton.

Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond

I was a passenger on this journey.

Just a passenger. Everything that

was done to bring us across was

done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim

Gordon. All the praise...

REPORTER

(calls out)

But you can fly, can't you?

AMELIA

This flight was solely to the

credit of Bill and Slim. Women

should know, however, that I have

had 500 hours solo flying and once

held the women's altitude record.

REPORTER

So you could have done it yourself!

AMELIA

This particular flight, under these

conditions, I wonder if anyone but

Bill Stultz could have pulled it

off. But certainly, one day a

woman will do this. As easily, as

skillfully, as professionally as

any man.

DOROTHY

Hey, that's my job.

(to Amelia)

Do you think there's enough of him

to boss for the two of us?

Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs.

AMELIA

Barely enough for one.

A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade.

REPORTER

Miss Earhart, can you tell us some-

thing about your future plans?

S

he likes this question.    Fixes the man with that clear,

honest gaze.

AMELIA

Well, being a social worker by

trade and passion, I'll be going

back to work at Denison House when

all this fun is over.

She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

...if I haven't been fired.

George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him

with a mischievous smile. And with no warning...

...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a

cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to

George, who...

...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into

traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers

or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo.

George watching her go.    Dorothy watching George.

REPORTER

Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social

worker like Miss Earhart become

comfortable as a celebrity so

quickly?

George smiles.   His eyes still following Amelia.

GEORGE

The truth is, she was a celebrity

on smaller stages all her life.

discovered her.

Rye. And I lived there, while I

wrote my book.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I thought he'd be a tyrant and that

I would have to manage him.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Instead he was kind and generous.

And only picked the fights he

needed to win.

GEORGE

Lucky Strike endorsement.      I wrote

the copy myself.

AMELIA

What does it say?   `I don't smoke

but you should?'

GEORGE

It says Lucky Strikes were the only

cigarettes aboard the Friendship.

That's true.

AMELIA

True and misleading.      Why would I

sign that?

GEORGE

So Bill and Slim get paid.

38.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

If you're too proud to take tobacco

money, donate it to Byrd's

expedition, and we get great

publicity.

This week's marriage proposals.

The top one's the most creative.

It's from Sing Sing.

can watch and share in our...'

looks up)

Did you write the copy on this one,

too?

DOROTHY (O.S., approaching)

Have you no shame, George? No

sense of the scandal you create?

DOROTHY (CONT'D)

You make her work for nothing. At

least you can feed her.

(to Amelia)

Are you done yet? If not, make him

write the rest, he will anyway.

GEORGE (V.O.)

The lecture and publicity schedule

was fierce. I was with her pretty

much all the time.

39.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This was the moment of opportunity.

Could we launch her into Lindbergh

status as a permanent icon, before

her name fell out of the news-

papers.

He re-ties her scarf.   Checking out the effect.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

We had separate agendas. For her,

it was the advancement of aviation

and of women.

He very slightly rearranges her hair, as if every lock

matters.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As for me, I liked to tell myself

it was about the money. Though

there was never much of that left

over.

She stands for inspection, with her trace of a teasing smile.

He holds out his hand and she gives him her note cards.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Really, it was about the chance

to be around her.

He flips through the A

cards, frowning as he goes.

MELIA (George imitation)

This will never do, A.E., simply

unacceptable.

He looks up.   She starts pacing around, gesturing as he

would...

AMELIA (George imitation)

You need more ammunition in these

cards, and where's the goddamned

humor, for Chrissake? By which I

mean something actually funny!

He's trying to look annoyed.   It isn't easy.

AMELIA (George imitation)

And please remember not to turn

your pretty little backside to the

crowd when you use your pointer,

it's your face they're paying to

see. Well, most of them.

She WHIPS around.   He's deadpan.

40.

AMELIA (George imitation)

And another thing. Your hats.

Are a menace.

GEORGE (softly)

Everything about you. Is a menace.

AMELIA (V.O.)

I remember the first kiss.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Of course, I knew all the stories

T

hat Dorothy had been having a

torrid affair with Fred Upton.

Everyone did.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But I didn't kiss him because I

felt sorry for him. Or because

it would mean the world to him.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I did it.    Because I wanted to.

38                                                                  38

41.

George answers the door, looking gracious and suave. They

shake hands. Then, Amelia appears, warmly clasping the

girl's hand, and Elinor looks as starstruck as a teenager at

the Oscars.

AMELIA

It's so good to meet you. I've

been following your career with

a great deal of admiration.

ELINOR

Um.   Thanks, and.   You, too.

AMELIA

Feel like a drink?

GEORGE

Amelia!   What would her mother

say?

AMELIA

Relax, George. I meant a Coke.

As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the

girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly

ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others,

the kid reacts. Oh, my.

L

ATER. Tea in the sitting room.    Elinor leaning forward,

guileless, eager...

ELINOR

They're saying you get $500 a week

on the lecture circuit.

GEORGE                          AMELIA

On a bad week.                  On a good week.

The girl looks from one to the other.

AMELIA

All depends. On whether you want

the sell or the real.

ELINOR

Oh, I don't underestimate the value

of selling. It's why I'm here.

GEORGE

A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude

record, then makes headlines

illegally flying under the four

bridges of the East River. You

don't seem to need much help

selling yourself.

42.

ELINOR

Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was

hoping you could do to me what

you've done to her.

ELINOR (CONT'D)

What I mean is. It's a good thing.

That's why I want it.

GEORGE

Just so we're clear, young lady.

What is your primary ambition?

ELINOR (straight back)

To take Amelia's place as the

number one female pilot.

AMELIA

Well, good for you! I would have

expected nothing less. You want

a tip?

ELINOR

I do.

AMELIA

Keep doing what you're doing.

A

MELIA (CONT'D)

And don't let anyone turn you

around.

GEORGE

Lovely party, huh?

DOROTHY

Depends on your point of view.

I've been listening to some idiot

brag about his girlfriend.

GEORGE

Well, in that case, for your

information, it is a lovely party

indeed. Anything on your mind?

DOROTHY

It's not so much that my husband

is having an affair with his meal

ticket. It's just a pity we can't

have one honest conversation about

it.

GEORGE

What's wrong with this one? A

promising start, I'd say, in the

honesty department.

Amelia in the window, watching them.

OROTHY

If this is what you call an honest

talk, I'd say you need some

practice.

GEORGE

Great. Let's try one about you

and Fred Upton.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Well, I'm waiting for our practice

conversation. Hoping I'll learn

something. About honesty.

GEORGE

Dorothy and I are through.

AMELIA

For a long, long time.

GEORGE

It's different now.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Marry me.

AMELIA

I can't do that.

GEORGE

If you give it a chance, you'll

learn to love me.

AMELIA

I already love you.    That's why I

can't marry you.

GEORGE (a murmur)

Well, that explains it. For a

minute there, I thought you were

stuck for an excuse.

he comes close enough to kiss.

AMELIA

I know me.     And you don't.   Not

really.

GEORGE

What if I promise not to learn?

45.

AMELIA

The day will come. When I will run

away. And when it does...

GEORGE

If you love me. I'll take my

chances.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Race you to bed.

42                                                               42

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely

competitors say hello to the press

announcing the First Women's Air

Derby, racing from Santa Monica to

Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers

`the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals

certainly know how to capture our

attention.

43                                                               43

EORGE (into phone)

Because Amelia invented the Powder

Puff Derby for female pilots. Then

the men running the damn race

suddenly decide every woman has to

carry a male navigator, and start

from east of the Rockies so they

won't crash into the mountains!

46.

GEORGE (into phone)

I'll tell you why it's a front page

story. Because Amelia pulled every

woman out of the race. So the

organizers had to roll over and

give in, or they'd have lost their

shirts. You want me to write your

headline?

He glances over.   Elinor in the doorway.

GEORGE (into phone)

Call you back. I've got a very

important guest.

He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit.   As she

does...

ELINOR

Wish I was important enough for

you to manage.

GEORGE

Well, I've just got one client.

And most days she's more than I

can manage.

Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.

ELINOR

Get in line behind the boys she

smacked around on the Derby.

He grins back.   You bet.

ELINOR (CONT'D)

Some of the gal flyers had their

doubts about her...well, her skill

level. But she's everyone's

champion now.

GEORGE

And both of those things.      Are the

S         reasons I called you.

trange words.   He has her attention.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I think it would be huge for women

flyers if Amelia won the Derby.

The publicity would put the race,

and all of you, up there with the

boys.

47.

ELINOR

I'm not sure she has much of a

chance, Mr. Putnam.

GEORGE

Well, the one shot would be putting

her in a far more powerful plane

than anything she's flown. We're

thinking the Lockheed Vega.

The girl's shock.    He really means this.

ELINOR

Sir, I've test piloted the Vega.

It's way more than she could ever

handle. It wouldn't be safe, let

alone successful.

He smiles.

GEORGE

That's why I'm thinking of you

flying with her. You could handle

the cross-country flying, the more

difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75

a week.

Elinor WHISTLES low.

ELINOR

Well, I think that's the most

generous opportunity I've ever

been offered.

He stares at her.

GEORGE

There's just one thing. Obviously,

it has to appear that Amelia did

all the flying. So when pictures

are taken, you'll stand off to one

side.

Her eyes narrow.    He's completely serious.

ELINOR

In that case, I'll get my own plane

and win the race myself.

GEORGE

You haven't changed.

N

o smile at all.

48.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Unfortunately for you, neither

have I.

The look in his eye is not to be ignored.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You can't win if you can't get a

plane to enter. Let me predict

that you won't.

The voice calm and low and riveting.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

In fact. If you reject my

generosity, you may come to regret

it. For a long, long time.

ELINOR

That's a threat.

GEORGE

I'm an intensely loyal person,

Elinor. And this is what my

loyalty requires.

She's glaring.   Reeling.   Trapped.

ELINOR

She's the one who said I shouldn't

let anybody turn me around.

GEORGE

She probably meant me.

So honest, the words confuse her.

ELINOR

Obviously, she doesn't see me as

a threat.

GEORGE

Oh, sure she does.

A straight smile...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

She just doesn't care.

...which silently fades.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

My job.     Is to care for her.

GEORGE

A

hat's wrong?

MELIA (clearly furious)

What could be wrong? I had such a

lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith.

GEORGE

he told you that I shut her out of

the Derby. And that's true.

AMELIA

And when were you going to tell me?

GEORGE (calm, straight)

Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And

I felt it needed to be done.

AMELIA

What? You think I wanted it done,

but just let you do the dirty work?

GEORGE

I didn't say that.

AMELIA

Because I'm no angel. Business is

competition and competition is

rough, and I thank my stars that

you're there making this life

happen for me, but...

GEORGE

ou're making your life hap...

AMELIA

But this is different.

AMELIA

You did it because you love me.

That stops him.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

And when we're married, you mustn't

Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

What's the big shock? I thought

you wanted to get married.

Full beat.

AMELIA

Well, then.

His eyes moving over her face.

What about what you said? The day

he nods.    It will.

AMELIA

You'll be destroyed. And part of

me will, too. And I think we both

know it.

And yet.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Sometimes things happen that way.

You're not better safe than sorry.

Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy.

AMELIA (a whisper) (CONT'D)

Yes?

GEORGE (a whisper)

Hell yes.

I consider myself bound to you

If we can be honest I think the

best be avoided should you or I

become interested deeply, or in

passing, with anyone else.

Please let us not interfere with

I

must exact a cruel promise. And

that is you will let me go in a

MELIA

I might fly to Paris.

GEORGE

Which is actually across the

Atlantic.

AMELIA

Hence, the article.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

I'm thinking of doing it solo.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Would you mind?

GEORGE

Not at all. When would you like

AMELIA

I'm surprised you're all right with

this...

GEORGE

Really.

AMELIA

Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the

lecture. Five years since

Lindbergh, no one's made it solo,

so many of them died.

D

54.

GEORGE

ell, they were only men.   This is

different.

AMELIA

I was waiting to hear that I'm only

doing this because I was just a

passenger last time, and I'd rather

die than go on living as a fraud..

A

MELIA (CONT'D)

But you don't think that, do you,

ear?

GEORGE

Of course not. But if I did...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

...all the more reason to say yes.

GEORGE

Elephant hair, I think you wear

it on your toe. It's good luck.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Anyway. That's what the elephant

told me.

AMELIA

I think luck has rules. And I try

to respect them. My favorite is...

She glances up.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

We make our own luck, you and I.

Remember that.

He will remember that.    And more.

GEORGE

Do you have money?

AMELIA

No.

He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

All this? G

EORGE

Sure.

AMELIA

Thank god, I thought you were going

to tear it in half.

GEORGE

I spent our money on ocean liner

passage to go bring you back. It's

non-refundable. So try to do your

part.

She nods.   She'll try.   He doesn't want to leave her yet.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

So the Simpkin thing. What was all

that?

AMELIA

I put it in a letter. Which you'll

get if I don't make it. So...mixed

emotions, huh?

He shakes his head.

GEORGE (very soft)

Either way, something to look

forward to.

She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave

him either.

56.

AMELIA (murmurs)

Stake up the peonies, huh? They're

messy when they bloom on the

ground, and...

AMELIA (a whisper)

I want to see their heads high.

When I come home.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

See ya.

51                                                                 51

AMELIA (V.O.)

The weather report wasn't perfect.

But we knew our real chance was to

take weather that others wouldn't.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I closed the deal by choosing May

20, five years to the day from

Lindbergh's flight. It was too

good a sell for George to resist.

5              What we didn't know...

AMELIA (V.O.)

...was that my altimeter would conk

out. Never to return.

53                                                                 53

AMELIA (V.O.)

The only way to have any sense of

altitude, was to keep dropping

toward the sea.

(MORE)

57.

AMELIA(cont'd)

When the engines sputtered, that

was my low-level limit.

A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles

back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the

nose UP, the engine COUGHS...

...and CLIMBS.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I was too busy to grasp how

impossible the situation had

become. The joke was...

LATER.   Flying in and out of cloud cover.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

All those months flying only with

instruments, I should have been

practicing without them.

PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a

vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I started to wonder if luck was

paying me back. For thinking I

knew the rules.

A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then I smelled burning oil.

She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in

the manifold ring.  A

MELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A bad weld, already a small flame.

It would be hours back to Canada,

trying to find an unlit field,

landing with a heavy fuel load.

She stares at the little flame.   Is it growing bigger?

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I told myself, push on. After all,

if it was a stupid choice...

LATER. Flying in blackness.    Rising, as the engines seem

sluggish.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...no one would ever know.

Suddenly, a FILM of SLUSH on the windscreen.

58.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

With seemingly no warning, there

was ice. The controls froze.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Through the spin I had one thought,

it would be warmer lower, the ice

would melt, I just had to regain

control...

54                                                                 54

AMELIA (V.O.)

...before I hit the water.

55                                                                 55

AMELIA (V.O.)

...or passed out.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The ice happened twice more, and I

began to lose heart. Then I

remembered Lindbergh's book saying

the same thing happened to him.

he sea DISAPPEARS below.   Only cloud.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

So I figured, if he's twice as

good, I just have to be twice as

lucky...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I'd read that part in George's

reception room that first day.

Bless him for keeping me waiting.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The cockpit gauge was defective.

There was a steady trickle of fuel

down my neck.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Toss-up whether the bigger danger

was running out of gas or going up

in a fireball. I had my answer in

less than an hour, when...

DISSOLVE TO...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The manifold weld began to

separate. I gauged the likelihood

of explosion at somewhere between

probable and inevitable.

She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently...

garbage?

AMELIA

Well, it reminds me how much I owe

ood. And remembering how little

you owe me keeps me humble.

And softly...

GEORGE

You've made them feel like this.

AMELIA

That's not enough.

GEORGE

Most of them are women. And for

them, it's very much enough.

She shakes her head.

AMELIA

The World Telegram said, `a

magnificent display of useless

courage.'

GEORGE

The question is. Can any magnif-

icent display of courage be use-

less?     A

MELIA

The point is. Men do it every day.

And no one throws a parade.

Ah.   Well...

GEORGE

One day closer, then. To the day

when they won't think to throw one

for you.

She doesn't turn.   She doesn't smile.

Reasoning with me. A magnificent

display of useless courage.

And.   It's fun.

From the stage...

GENE

Transcontinental was too ambitious.

Too many hops, too tough on the

ladies. But the shuttle...

GENE (CONT'D)

Washington, New York, Boston. I

think it's the future. Will you

go there with us?

AMELIA

What on earth would you need me

PAUL

Hasn't George taught you anything?

Lady Lindy, the queen of the air,

the best known woman in the entire

U.S. of A?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Gene on the poster with you.

Legendary athlete at West Point,

two events in the Olympics, a top

pilot who should be running the

skies for Roosevelt when he wins...

Gene looks up at Paul, as if to say: Enough. Now he smiles

at Amelia. She blinks, what? Don't you want your lobster?

G

Oh. She starts eating...

ENE (looking only at Amelia)

Thanks, Paul. I think you've even

talked me out of it.

DISSOLVE TO...

LATER. Paul has gone. Gene and Amelia are at the bar,

huddled over his beer and her Coke.

AMELIA (V.O.)

Gene had a terrible marriage and

was separated from his alcoholic

adulterous wife. But he was too

kind to humiliate her with a

divorce...

Gene drains the last of his beer.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As a result, he was basically a

single parent to their young son,

Gore.

He glances at his watch.      Wow.

GENE

I'm rattling on here, and you've

got a morning train.

But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last

chance to ask...

AMELIA

How's Nina doing?

GENE

Oh, fine.

Really?   He smiles, gently.

GENE (CONT'D)

Actually, she hasn't been feeling

her best. She'll probably summer

in Newport. So my kid's stuck with

Dad again.

AMELIA

If you two get bored, I could tag

along sometimes.

GENE

You suggesting you're less boring

than I am?

AMELIA

Well, yeh.

He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Any given meal, I can eat a lobster

and have you boys in stitches.

A full beat.    He's deciding.

GENE

Gore would love that. He has a

little crush, I'm afraid.

AMELIA

At seven?

GENE

He's eight.

Well, then. He breaks the look.     Fishes out some cash for

the bar tab.        G

ENE (CONT'D)

Listen, Paul and I would be

thrilled to rope you into our

shuttle.

AMELIA

Are you kidding, it's a godsend.

No matter how hard George and I

work, how many lectures we cram in,

there's never enough money for the

next adventure.

He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem

to convey a depth of understanding.

GENE

The next adventure.    What is it?

She shrugs.    No idea.

GENE (CONT'D)

Because we're running out of

oceans.

AMELIA

Wish you'd do something about that.

69.

GENE

I'm serious, Amelia.

AMELIA

I know.   Always.

GENE

The only way you can stay where you

are. And be who you are...

GENE (CONT'D)

Is to keep feeding the beast.

GENE (CONT'D)

And the beast always needs

something larger, greater, more

daring...

AMELIA (quiet)

He costs money, too.

GENE

The price of fame, literally. Do

you and George talk about this?

AMELIA

We don't have to.

women to national attention with

stunning success.

each morning on horseback, and

carried a pistol on car trips.

She possessed boundless energy, a

towering intellect...

...and was Amelia's idol. As it

happened, she was obsessed with

flying, making Amelia her absolute

heroine. A

Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore

Experts are saying that this

There's nothing to be learned for

common-sense thinking on this...

rudder pedal instead of the

throttle.

we've seen before.

GEORGE

Have fun.

AMELIA

Who let you off the hook on this?

She takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar

toward Gene. He smiles, unfolds a third chair. As they

arrive, Amelia steps forward...

Thanks for letting me come.

As they sit, Gene looks from one to the other.

monsoons in Africa...

Gene nods, slowly.    His eyes still locked on her.

GENE

Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland

because it was my bright idea,

and I'd feel responsible if...

AMELIA

Well, if I do pop off, I'll try

to make it somewhere that's not

your fault.

GENE

I'd appreciate that.

GENE (CONT'D)

You miss that island. You'll be

out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.

AMELIA

But I'll have Fred so I won't miss.

In fact, I'm taking Fred along for

this whole trip.

Surprisingly, he doesn't seem to like this.   She smiles.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Giving up my little arrogance about

solo. Safety first, yes?

But he's still unhappy.   She waits for him to say.

You and Fred alone for a month...

If you're worried about his

drinking, I'll deal with it.

antenna, she would leave behind

important.

George's hand and HOPS down from the wing. More FLASHES...

DOWN the runway it RUMBLES, still earthbound, only 200 yards

to go. Then 100. Then FIFTY, then at the water's edge, the

Electra RISES and...

.

..DROPS out of sight below the land, as we SMASH CUT to...

ANGLE. The Electra has FALLEN to SIX FEET above the surface

of the Gulf. The engines THROB at max, the propellers

THROWING SPRAY. The overloaded plane...

...RISING.    Slowly, then faster, then...

...SOARING free.

PULL BACK to a VIEW from down the runway. The Electra in

distance. RACK FOCUS to see something long and slender

GLINTING on the ground. Could it be a length of WIRE?

INT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - SUNSET

Through the glass, the sun is disappearing toward Amelia.

PULL BACK to George, staring at a CABLE in his hands. We

HEAR...

BALFOUR (O.S.)

Mr. Putnam. Their headwinds are

stronger than they knew when they

took off.

Then...

BALFOUR (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I recalculated their fuel. It will

cost them 9%.

George staring off. Assessing the consequences. PULL BACK

to see an ENSIGN standing, waiting for instruction.

BALFOUR (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I can't raise them, sir. I tried

voice, and Morse Code...

W

120.

George looks up.   Calmly.

GEORGE

ire back. Tell him to forget the

Morse Code. They didn't bring the

receiver.

The young man looks concerned.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Just tell him to stay with voice.

He'll get them.

EXT. HOWLAND ISLAND - DAY

ERIAL ANGLE. A tiny, flat, nearly invisible speck adrift in

the endless Pacific. Howland Island. PAN to see just

offshore...

GEORGE (V.O.)

The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca

had been anchored off Howland just

for us.

CLOSE on the ITASCA now...

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Its radio would be her lifeline.

Its black plume of smoke would

reach for miles. More visible than

the island itself.

DISSOLVE TO NIGHT. The island visible only by its slender

LIGHTHOUSE. The ship illuminated in the darkness.

CLOSE now on a path by the sea. A lone figure with a

FLASHLIGHT approaches a SHACK. Enters...

INT. RADIO HUT - NIGHT

...a room filled with radio equipment. He is FRANK CIPRIANI,

in crisp naval uniform, relieving a SEAMAN who has been on

duty. As Cipriani sits at his station, he notices...

CIPRIANI

The direction finder.   How long has

this been on?

The seaman turns back at the door.   What?

EXT. ITASCA

INT. RADIO ROOM, ITASCA - NIGHT

The room is 9 x 20 with bare walls. At the transmitter, LEO

BELLARTS the chief radio man. Short and square, an

unflappable air of quiet expertise. With him, his assistant

WILLIAM DALTEN, lean and young with dark serious eyes. At a

typewriter sits THOMAS O'HARE, barely twenty, headphones

across his shock of rust-colored hair, telegraph at the

ready.

S

UPERIMPOSE:    2:45 A.M.

Dalten adjusting the receiver which is suddenly spitting

STATIC. Threading through the noise, what could be a human

voice. Bellarts calls to O'Hare...

BELLARTS

That's her on 3105. She said

`cloudy and overcast.'

O'Hare looks at him. Are you serious? Bellarts mimes typing

with his fingers. O'Hare starts typing into the log.

DISSOLVE TO...

SUPERIMPOSE:    3:45 A.M.

Radio CRACKLES.    All eyes turn.

AMELIA (O.S.)

Itasca from Earhart. Overcast.

Static.   Dalten leans to the mic...

DALTEN (into mic)

We are receiving your signal.

Please acknowledge ours. What is

your position? When do you expect

to arrive Howland?

No answer.    Light static.

BELLARTS

Commander estimated 7:00. If she's

having trouble on voice

transmission, stay with Morse.

And begins to carefully pack his pipe.      Dalten begins to

transmit Morse Code. DISSOLVE TO...

SUPERIMPOSE:    6:45 A.M.

The radio.    The static.   The sudden voice...

K

122.

AMELIA (O.S.)

Please take bearing on us and

report in half hour. I will make

noise in microphone. We are about

100 miles out.

The transmission cuts out.     Dalten answers in Morse Code.    No

response.

DALTEN

She's got to stay on longer.

Bellarts dictating as O'Hare types...

BELLARTS

Earhart signal strength 4, but on

A

ir so briefly bearings impossible.

DISSOLVE TO...

SUPERIMPOSE:    7:18 A.M.

DALTEN (to Bellarts)

Maybe her Morse receiver is out.

(into mic)

Can't take bearing on 3105. Please

send on 500 or do you want to take

bearing on us? Go ahead, please.

Silence.   O'Hare typing:    NO ANSWER.

SUPERIMPOSE:    7:30 A.M.

DALTEN (into mic)

Please acknowledge our signals on

ey. Please acknowledge.

CRACKLE.   O'Hare typing:    UNANSWERED.

BELLARTS

Tommy, intercom top deck, double

check the smoke stack...

INTERCUT: AERIAL ANGLE high above the ship.       BLACK SMOKE

PLUMES into clear sky...

BELLARTS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

They should be able to see it for

twenty miles, at least.

TILT ANGLE.    In far distance, thirty to forty miles, a gray

STORM.

INT. RADIO ROOM - MORNING

A few others enter now. Civilians, sailors, they hang back

silently, watching as...

SUPERIMPOSE:   7:42 A.M.

AMELIA (O.S.)

KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be

on you but cannot see you...

Glances are traded. It is the first moment of visible

concern. STATIC interrupts. Then...

AMELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Gas is running low. Been unable to

reach you by radio. We are flying

t altitude 1000 feet.

DALTEN (into mic)

You are reaching us. We are

sending on 3105 and 500 constantly.

Please acknowledge.

Massive BURST of static. Dalten frantically CLICKING a

message in Morse Code. DISSOLVE TO...

S

UPERIMPOSE:    7:58 A.M.

The room has nearly filled. COMMANDER THOMPSON stands at

Bellart's shoulder. All eyes fixed on the radio...

EARHART (O.S.)

We are circling but cannot hear

you. Go ahead on 7500.

BELLARTS (into mic)

Itasca to KHAQQ. Your signal is

strong. Are you receiving this?

A breathless moment.   A sharp CRACKLE.

EARHART (O.S.)

KHAQQ calling Itasca. We received

your signal, but unable to get a

minimum. Please take bearing on

us and answer 3105 with voice.

BELLARTS (into mic)

Your signal received okay. It is

impractical to take a bearing on

3105 on your voice. Give us a

longer signal, please. Go ahead.

Silence.   Feet are shifting.   No one speaks.

O

O

124.

BELLARTS (softly to Dalten)

Keep us at 7500, that's her only

acknowledgment.

THOMPSON

You've got her signal, dammit.

What about the direction finder?

BELLARTS

Cipriani reports the battery's

dead, sir. It was left on all

night.

Full beat.

THOMPSON (low)

I don't believe this is happening.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUPERIMPOSE:     8:12 A.M.

BELLARTS (into mic)

Itasca to Earhart. Did you get

transmission on 7500? Go ahead on

500 so that we can take a bearing

on you, it's impossible on 3105.

Please acknowledge.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUPERIMPOSE:     8:33 A.M.

No breath in this room.      No one moves.

BELLARTS (into mic)

Will you please come in and answer

n 500? We are transmitting

constantly on 7500 and we do not

hear you on 500. Please answer on

500. Go ahead.

DISSOLVE TO:

SUPERIMPOSE:     8:44 A.M.

Suddenly, a thin and anxious VOICE cuts through a burst of

static...            A

MELIA (O.S.)

We are on the line of position 157-

337, will repeat this message on

6210 kilocycles. Wait, listening

n 6210 kilocycles. We are running

north and south.

F

125.

BELLARTS (into mic)

We hear you. We hear you. Can you

receive this...?

Silence.   Silence.   Silence.

COMMANDER (softly)

Mr. Bellarts. When did she say she

was low on fuel?

All eyes shift to Tommy.    He scans the log.    Stares.

O'HARE

Um. An hour. And two minutes,

sir.

HOLD on this room.    DISSOLVE TO...

AERIAL ANGLE. The ship in clear daylight.       The BLACK PLUME

of smoke stretching to heaven.

SLOW DISSOLVE

The tiny room we've come to know. It is filled with people

who stand motionless, staring somberly at one man. In turn,

he stares at a telephone...

Which RINGS. Mary reaches, but his hand goes UP and she

pulls back. He lets it ring three times, four, gathering

himself. Lifting it...

GEORGE (into phone)

Yes.

There are no other words.    His eyes tear up.    He nods numbly

at the phone.        G

EORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Looking back, the questions were

obvious. Why would anyone try to

ind such a tiny target in a vast

ocean, with barely an hour's lee-

way in fuel?

He draws a breath.

GEORGE (into phone)

Well, we're most grateful. With

such an effort, of course they'll

e found.

I

126.

CLOSE on him now.   As he listens, as he responds graciously,

MOS...

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

So I tortured myself. Why hadn't

killed this plan on day one?

And then I realized...

DISSOLVE SLOWLY

TO...

EXT. GARDEN, LOS ANGELES - LATER

Alone.   In a moonlit garden.

GEORGE (V.O.)

If I tried to count the insane and

reckless chances she took from the

first moment I met her. I wouldn't

know where to begin.

Slowly to his knees.   By the plants they had tended together.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was the most tragic of endings.

The most cruel and senseless and

wasteful. And yet...

And yet.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

It's hard to imagine another.

SMASH CUT TO...

EXT. BRILLIANT SKY, THE PACIFIC - DAY

Sun and cloud.   The sea below.

AMELIA (V.O.)

My Simpkin.

We POINT toward the water.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I want to be married to you. The

way you've been married to me.

It begins to draw CLOSER.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As you read this. I am watching

your face.

127.

And CLOSER.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I am hoping to see. That you know

how much I mean each word.

Gaining SPEED now...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

All the things I never said, for

so very long...

HURTLING TOWARD the surface...

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Look up. They're in my eyes.

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

Hold.

ROLL END CREDITS.
