LONE STAR

"LONE STAR"

By

John Sayles

CLIFF

We got ocotillo, devil's walking

stick--what's this stuff--it's that

whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

MIKEY

This place is a gold mine.

CLIFF

Lead mine.

MIKEY

What?

CLIFF

It's a lead mine.

MIKEY

Right.

CLIFF

I don't know why I'm talking to you,

you've got that thing on your head.

MIKEY

You finding lots of cactus and shit?

CLIFF

It's not just cactus.  There's the

nopals, the yuccas--

MIKEY

(Puts headset on)

Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

CLIFF

(Grumbles)

Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties

of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia

from a prickly pear.

MIKEY

(Troubled)

Cliff--

CLIFF

You live in a place, you should know

something about it. Explore--

MIKEY

Cliff--

MIKEY

Cliff, you gotta look at this--

CLIFF

Don't tell me--Spanish treasure,

right?  Pieces of eight from the

Coronado expedition--

CLIFF

Jesus--

MIKEY (O.S.)

Was Coronado in the Masons?

SAM

I was driving back from Apache Wells

when they got me on the radio.

CLIFF

This was a rifle range way back when.

But we figured it isn't Army land

anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

SAM

(Nods)

I've got the forensics fella coming

down from the Rangers. No way to

know how old the body is without

some lab work.

CLIFF

That ring--

SAM

Masons been around a long while.

SAM

Treasure hunter?

CLIFF

(Apologetic)

Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art

with them.

CLIFF

The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch

anything,

MIKEY

(To Sam)

He can't hear with that rig on--

Mikey!

MIKEY

What've we got here?

SAM

S'posed to leave everything right

where we found it. They're real

particular about that.

MIKEY

The scene of the crime.

SAM

No telling yet if there's been a

crime.

SAM (O.S.)

But this country's seen a good number

of disagreements over the years.

PILAR (O.S.)

We do the best we can here--

PILAR

--but hey, public education these

days is a bit of a battleground.

CELIE

He went to school on base when we

were in Okinawa. It's all--you know--

kids in the same boat--Army brats.

PILAR

His record shows that he's a good

student.

CELIE

I'm more worried about the social

thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?

PILAR

We haven't had any serious violence,

if that's what you mean. We've got a

pretty lively mix though--you walk

into the cafeteria and the Anglo

kids are in one section, the Mexican

kids in another and the Black kids

have a table in the back--thanks--

CELIE

So Blacks are--

PILAR

They're the smallest group except

for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look,

you're obviously a concerned parent.

Chet has no history of getting into

trouble--I'm happy to have him in my

class.

MOLLY

(Uncomfortable)

Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

PILAR

Okay? He's not here?

MOLLY

No. Is he sick?

PILAR

(Mutters)

He's going to wish he was dead.

AMADO (O.S.)

Luis! Give me that Phillips-head

back--

AMADO

Somebody hand me the CD player--

damelo pendejos--

TRAVIS

They come a long way from those old

8-track jobs, haven't they?

AMADO

Something wrong?

TRAVIS

(Waves radio)

This is stolen property. Alla you

fellas are coming down to the station.

HOLLIS

So Buddy walks up to the porch and

there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin'

the dirt out his toenails with a

pocketknife--he was the most hygienic

of all the McHenrys--

HOLLIS

"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet

way of his, "What you know about

them tires that went missing from

markets?" Fishbait thinks for a

minute, then he lifts up a loose

board from the porch floor and calls

down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter,

they caught us!"

FENTON

(Laughing)

Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

HOLLIS

He known who it was onnacouna the

tire tracks in the dirt from the

back of the garage to where they

loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says,

"never lifted a thing in this world

if there was a way he could roll

it."

FENTON

Won't be another like him. That boy

of his doesn't come near it. You ask

me, he's all hat and no cattle

SAM (O.S.)

Fellas--

HOLLIS

Sam! I was just telling a few about

your old man.

FENTON

He was a unique individual.

SAM

Yeah, he was that.

HOLLIS

Big day coming up--I wish we'd have

thought of it while he was still

living. But he went so unexpected.

FENTON

Better late than never. Korean War

hero, Sheriff for near thirty years--

Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

SAM

I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

HOLLIS

Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers.

Danny Padilla from the Sentinel,

that crowd.

FENTON

Every other damn thing in the country

is called after Martin Luther King,

they can't let our side have one

measly park?

HOLLIS

King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--

FENTON

Bad enough all the street names are

in Spanish--

SAM

They were here first.

FENTON

Then name it after Big Chief

Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa

fella was. He had the Mexes beat by

centuries.

HOLLIS

There was a faction pulling for that

boy who was killed in the Gulf War--

Ruben--

SAM

--Santiago.

HOLLIS

Right. But nobody here ever noticed

him till they read his name on the

national news--

FENTON

They just wanted it to be one of

theirs--

HOLLIS

That's not the whole story. The

Mexicans that know, that remember,

understand what Buddy was for their

people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over

there who swung the deciding vote

for him.

SAM

That so?

HOLLIS

She put it even at three to three,

so as the Mayor I get to cast the

tiebreaker. The older generation

won't have any problem with it. They

remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff,

that it was all 'cause he took their

part.

FENTON

Tell that one, Hollis--

HOLLIS

Hell, everybody heard that story a

million times.

SAM

I'd like to hear it. Your version of

it.

FENTON

Go ahead, Hollis.

HOLLIS

The two of us were the only deputies

back then me and Buddy--it's what--

'58--

FENTON (O.S.)

'57, 1 believe--

HOLLIS

And the Sheriff at the time was Big

Charley Wade. Charley was one of

your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets

kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy

bite out of whatever moved through

this county.

HOLLIS

It was in here one night, back  when

Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started

right here in this booth.

WADE

(Grins)

This beaner fare doesn't agree with

me, but the price sure is right.

BUDDY

What's that for?

WADE

Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks,

most of 'em relatives. People breed

like chickens.

BUDDY

So?

WADE

I roust some muchacho on the street,

doesn't have his papers, all he got

to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy

Herrera."

WADE

You got to keep the wheels greased,

son. Sheriff does his job right,

everybody makes out. Now this is

gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy.

First of the month, just like the

rent. Get the car, Hollis.

BUDDY

I'm not doing it.

WADE

Come again?

BUDDY

It's your deal. You sweated it out

of him, you pick it up.

WADE

There's gonna be some left over for

you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.

BUDDY

That's not the point.

WADE

You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him

tell you the size of the mordida

they took out of his hide when he

run a place on the other side. Those

old boys in Ciudad Leon--

BUDDY

I'm not picking it up.

WADE

You do whatever I say you do or else

you put it on the trail, son.

BUDDY

How 'bout this--how 'bout you put

that shield on this table and  vanish

before you end up dead or in jail?

BUDDY

You ever shoot anybody was looking

you in the eye?

WADE

Who said anything about shootin'

anybody?

BUDDY

Whole different story; isn't it?

WADE

You're fired. You're outta the

department.

BUDDY

There's not a soul in this county

isn't sick to death of your bullshit,

Charley. You made yourself scarce,

you could make a lot of people happy.

WADE

You little pissant--

BUDDY

Now or later, Charley. You won't

have any trouble finding me.

WADE

You're a dead man.

WADE

Get the goddamn car. We're going to

Roderick's.

BUDDY

Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

HOLLIS (O.S.)

"Mas cerveza por favor."

FENTON (O.S.)

That Buddy was a cool breeze.

FENTON

Charley Wade were known to have put

a good number of people in the ground,

and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball

with him.

HOLLIS

We made our collection at Roderick's

place and that was the last anybody

seen hide nor hair of him.  He went

missing the next day, along with ten

thousand dollars in county funds

from the safe at the jail.

SAM

Never heard from him again?

HOLLIS

Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of

town.

FENTON

Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn

well backed it up. Won't be another

like him.

SAM

So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's

people and sent 'em back to the other

side?

HOLLIS

Oh--he come to an accommodation.

Money doesn't always need to change

hands to keep the wheels turning.

SAM

Right.

HOLLIS

Look, I know you had some problems

with your father, and he and Muriel--

well--

FENTON

Your mother was a saint.

HOLLIS

--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

SAM

Won't be another like him.

DEL

--it's an honor for me to assume

command of this unit, and I look

forward to working with all of you.

DEL (O.S.)

I'm sure you're all aware of the

Army's decision to close this

installation under the Reduction in

Force plan. That does not mean,

however--

DEL

--that we've been sent here to mark

time until we are absorbed by another

unit.

DEL

You may have heard rumors that I run

a very tight operation. These rumors

are not exaggerated.

SECRETARY (O.S.)

Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the

paper for you--

SAM

Tell him I'll catch him later.

SECRETARY (O.S.)

He says he needs to talk to you before

the ceremony, Sam.

SAM

Tell him to try me tomorrow.

SECRETARY (O.S.)

He thinks you're trying to duck

him.

SAM

(Mutters)

He's right.

OTIS

You weren't in here tonight, were

you?

CHET

No sir.

OTIS

(Points)

Go out through the back.

ANGLO MOTHER

You're just tearin' everything  down!

Tearin' down our heritage, tearin'

down the memory of people that fought

and died for this land.

CHICANO FATHER (O.S.)

We fought and died for this land,

too!

CHICANO FATHER

We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas

Rangers--

ANGLO FATHER (O.S.)

Yeah, but you lost, buddy!

ANGLO FATHER

Winners get the bragging rights,

that's how it goes.

PRINCIPAL (O.S.)

People--people--

PRINCIPAL

I think it would be best not to put

things in terms of winners and losers--

ANGLO MOTHER

(Points at Pilar)

Well, the way she's teachin' it has

got everything switched around. I

was on the textbook committee, and

her version is not--

PRINCIPAL

We think of the textbook as kind of

a guide, not an absolute--

ANGLO MOTHER

--it is not what we set as the

standard! Now you people can believe

what you want, but when it comes to

teaching our children--

CHICANO MOTHER

They're our children, too!

ANGLO FATHER

The men who founded this state have

a right to have their story--

DANNY

The men who founded this state broke

from Mexico because they needed

slavery to be legal to make a fortune

in the cotton business!

PILAR

I think that's a bit of an

oversimplification--

ANGLO FATHER

Are you reporting this meeting or

runnin' it, Danny?

DANNY

Just adding a little historical

perspective--

ANGLO FATHER

You may call it history, but I call

it propaganda. I'm sure they got

their own account of the Alamo on

the other side, but we're not on the

other side, so we're not about to

have it taught in our schools!

PILAR

There's no reason to be so threatened

by this--

PILAR

I've only been trying to get across

some of the complexity of our

situation down here--cultures coming

together in both negative and positive

ways.

ANGLO MOTHER (O.S.)

If you mean like music and food and

all, I have no problem with that.

ANGLO MOTHER

--but when you start changing who

did what to who.

TEACHER

We're not changing anything, we're

presenting a more complete picture.

ANGLO MOTHER

And that's what's got to stop!

TEACHER

There's enough ignorance in the world

without us encouraging it in the

classroom--

ANGLO MOTHER

Now who are you calling ignorant?

PRINCIPAL

Folks, I know this is a very emotional

issue for some of you, but we do

have other business to attend to--

CHICANO FATHER

We're not going to get some resolution

on this?

PRINCIPAL

Would you people like to form another

committee?

SHADOW

I hope the sucker does die, man!

Mess with me, that's what you get!

RAY

Hospital says the other kid is in

bad shape--

SAM

(Glances ahead)

The shooter local?

RAY

(Shakes his bead)

Down from Houston. I think he knew

the girl before.

SAM

Okay--we'll take a statement from

all the GIs before they go back to

post. You can get the story from

Otis over at the club.

RAY

Any poop on the John Doe you found

out there today?

SAM

Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben

Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

SAM (O.S.)

Pilar.

SAM

Something wrong?

PILAR

They've got my Amado.

SAM

Got him here?

PILAR

Somebody called--something about an

electronics store.

SAM

I'll see what's going on.

SAM

I was--I was real sorry about Nando.

He was a good fella. We haven't talked

since.

PILAR

We haven't talked since high school.

SAM

Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.

ATHENA

--so Richie just didn't say nothin'

'cause he didn't want to get into

it, see, and the next thing I know

there's shots and Richie is down. It

happened so fast--

SAM (O.S.)

Excuse me--

SAM

We got some boys you run in earlier

today?

TRAVIS

Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs

at Pico Bernal's place. We finally

caught them with something.

SAM

You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado

Cruz?

TRAVIS

Yeah--let's see--the other ones say

he wasn't in on the theft, he just

knows how to hook things up. We've

been trying to contact a parent.

SAM

They tell me you're good at fixing

things.

SAM

Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

SAM

You know, if you figure minimum wage

on the time most thieves spend in

jail, they could have bought most

everything they stole.

AMADO

I didn't steal anything.

SAM

I didn't say you did. My name is

Sam, by the way.

SAM

He's all yours.

PILAR

Are you okay?

AMADO

I don't know what the big deal is.

PILAR

You'll find out when I get you home.

Thanks, Sam.

SAM

No problem.

SAM

Any time.

FADE OUT:

MIKEY

There's not that much down here,

Colonel. Big O's is the only place

in the county that our African

American soldiers are uhm--that they

feel comfortable in.

DEL

Have we had trouble there before?

CLIFF

Since I've been stationed here? A

fistfight now and then--

MIKEY

We had a kid pass out in the men's

room. The town isn't much.

DEL

They didn't come for a vacation.

CLIFF

Yes sir.

MIKEY

You know how it is, Colonel--first

time away from home, dealing with

new people--I remember my first hitch--

DEL

Substance abuse?

MIKEY

Well, yeah, but I went through the

Program. I haven't had a drink since--

DEL

I meant on the post. In general. How

are you dealing with it?

CLIFF

We throw a urine test at them once a

month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred

people at a time

DEL

Why don't we make it once a week for

a while?

CLIFF

No problem, sir.

DEL

I sprint the last quarter mile. You

gentlemen don't have to keep up if

you don't care to.

MIKEY

Appreciate it, sir.

MIKEY

Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

CLIFF

(Grins)

You get the feeling he doesn't want

to be here?

BEN

Sam the Man.

SAM

Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

BEN

How's business?

SAM

Business is booming. Got your drugs,

got your illegals--had a shooting

the other night at Big O's--Soldier

got ventilated.

BEN

I hear they're closing that post

down.

SAM

September '97, that's all she wrote.

BEN

Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this

county.

SAM

Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over

to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.

SAM

That the word on our boy?

BEN

Yeah, this is Skinny.

SAM

Skinny?

BEN

We find a body, it's either Skinny

or Stinky, depending on how much

meat there is on the bones.

SAM

Nice job.

BEN

(Opens folder)

Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot-

eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get

into the dental records--

SAM

Charley Wade.

BEN

(Nods)

That badge--

SAM

--it didn't come out of a cereal

box.

BEN

Yeah.

SAM

You know the popular version of how

he left town.

BEN

Everybody on the border knows that

story.

SAM

You got a cause of death?

BEN

Skull was intact, no soft tissue

left--not much to go on.

SAM

So he could have gone out to the

base, hopped the fence, dug down

into the dirt on the old rifle range

and had a heart attack.

BEN

You uhm--you remember what old Buddy

carried for a side arm?

SAM

Colt Peacemaker.

BEN

A .45--

SAM

He swore by it.

(Ben frowns)

What?

BEN

Just wondering.

SAM

So is Buddy on your short list?

BEN

If it was some poor mojado, swam

across at night, got lost in the

scrub and starved out there, we

wouldn't go any further. But this is

a formerly prominent citizen.

SAM

You got to investigate. No question

about it.

BEN

What I will do is keep names out of

it till we got some answers or hit a

dead end. You know how the press is

with a murder story--even if it's

forty years old.

SAM

Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

BEN

I remember Charley Wade come to my

father's hardware store once when I

was a little boy. I'd heard stories

how he shot this one, how he shot

that one--man winked at me and I

peed in my pants.

(Shakes his head)

Winked at me.

PILAR

Okay, we have the fight against the

Spanish with bloody conflict for

dozens of years till they're finally

defeated in 1821 and Mexican

independence is declared. Anglo

settlers are invited--

PILAR (O.S.)

--to colonize the area and by the

time they begin the movement against

Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans

here by four to one. The war between

Mexico--

PILAR (O.S.)

and the Anglo forces ends in 1836

with the formation of the Texas

Republic. Texas joins the United

States as a state where slavery is

legal in 1845--

PILAR (O.S.)

after the so-called Mexican war and

then secedes to join the Confederacy

in 1861. The Confederacy is beaten,

and the Reformation period here is

marked by range wars and race wars--

PILAR

--and all this paralleled by constant

battles between both the Mexican and

Anglo settlers and the various Indian

nations in the area. What are we

seeing here? Chet?

CHET

Uhm--everybody is killing everybody

else?

SAM

I always wondered what you Mayors do

when you're not cutting ribbons.

HOLLIS

Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing

hooky--

SAM

(Looks across lake)

Floating around out here, playin'

hell with them bass--play a little

cards, play a little golf, drink

some beer--

HOLLIS

Sounds great. Where do I sign up?

SAM

I haven't been out here for a while.

HOLLIS

You go by your old house?

SAM

No.

HOLLIS

Just as well. The new people just

painted it some God-awful color--

SAM

We found a body out by the Army base

yesterday. Been there for a long

time.

HOLLIS

Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

SAM

(Smiles)

You recall if Charley Wade was a

Mason?

HOLLIS

Charley? I believe he was. Used to

go for lodge meetings over to Laredo.

What's he got to do with your body?

SAM

All it was wearing was a big old

Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs

badge.

SAM

You don't remember anything else

from that last night you saw him, do

you?

HOLLIS

I told the story enough times--hell,

we were just in the car, he was

stewing about the fight with Buddy

while we drove over to Roderick

Bledsoe's--

SAM

Bledso

HOLLIS

He owned the colored roadhouse before

Big O--

SAM

He still living?

HOLLIS

No. I think his widow's still in

their place in Darktown, though.

(Shakes his bead)

You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

SAM

Forensics people are sure of it. You

have any idea who might have put him

there?

SAM

Besides my father, I mean.

HOLLIS

There's no call for that, Sam. Fella

made himself a pile of enemies over

the years.

SAM

And Buddy was one of them.

HOLLIS

We got that dedication tomorrow.

This is a hell of a time to be

draggin' up old business.

SAM

People have worked this whole big

thing up around my father. If it's

built on a crime, they deserve to

know. Now I understand why you might

want to believe he couldn't do it.

HOLLIS

And I understand why you might want

to think he could.

SAM

Thanks for your time, Hollis.

HOLLIS

Look at all this, would you? My

tackle, the boat, all to catch a

little old fish just minding its

business on the bottom of the lake.

HOLLIS

Hardly seems worth the effort--does

it, Sam? Sam walks away--

CLIFF (O.S.)

So you knew this young man before?

ATHENA

From back in Houston. We both come

up on Fifth Street.

PRISCILLA (O.S.)

Did you know he was going to be there

last night?

ATHENA

If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

PRISCILLA (O.S.)

And you and Private Graves--

ATHENA

We were just dancing--

PRISCILLA

We're not running a dating service

here.

ATHENA

I know that, Sergeant. We were just

dancing. There was a bunch of us

there. Shadow just come down looking

for trouble.

CLIFF

It's not our job to get involved in

your personal life, but when it

interferes with the training here--

ATHENA

I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There

wasn't anything I could do. Shadow

gets crazy--

ATHENA

Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing?

Private Graves?

CLIFF

He'll live.

PRISCILLA

He'll be transferred to a military

hospital as soon as he's stabilized--

CLIFF

He'll probably be getting a medical

discharge--

ATHENA

Out of the Army?

CLIFF

He's going to lose a lung. This is

not good news for Athena--

ATHENA

Will this go on my record?

CLIFF

If the incident happened the way you

say it did, there hasn't been an

infraction.

ATHENA

Thank you, Sergeant Major.

CLIFF

You're dismissed.

ATHENA

Thank you, Sergeant Major.

PRISCILLA

You spoil 'em, Cliff.

CLIFF

Hey--she's in a tough situation. I

cut her some slack--

PRISCILLA

But I'm the one in charge of her

sorry ass.

CLIFF

She's pulled herself out of a pretty

rough neighborhood.

PRISCILLA

And if she isn't careful she's gonna

slide right back into it.

SAM

Mrs. Bledsoe?

MINNIE

That's me.

SAM

I'm Sheriff Deeds--

MINNIE

Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just

Sheriff junior.

SAM

(Smiles)

Yeah, that's the story of my life.

MINNIE

You ever play one of these?

SAM

I've seen 'em.

MINNIE

Well, don't ever start up on 'em,

cause once you do you can't stop. I

tell myself I'm gonna play just three

little games after breakfast, and

here I sit with half the day gone.

SAM

You mind if I ask a few questions

about your husband? Roderick?

MINNIE

I won't say nothing bad about the

man, but you can ask away.

SAM

He had the club out on the old trail

road--

MINNIE

We run that twenty-odd years. Give

it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.

SAM

So you must remember Sheriff Wade.

MINNIE

Not if I can help it.

SAM

You had to deal with him in running

the club.

MINNIE

Them days, you deal with Sheriff

Wade or you didn't deal at all. First

of the month, every month, he remind

you of who you really workin' for.

SAM

He squeezed money out of you?

MINNIE

Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a

glass back then unless you was a

club, see. Roderick used to say,

"Buy yourself a drink, you get a

free membership." But Sheriff Wade,

he could shut you down anytime.

SAM

And my father?

MINNIE

Sheriff Buddy was a different story.

Long as Roderick throw his weight

the right way on election day, make

sure all the colored get out to vote-

we was called colored back then, if

you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue

for the right people now and then,

things was peaceful. That Sheriff

Wade, though, he took an awful big

bite.

SAM

People didn't complain?

MINNIE

Not if they was colored or Meskin.

Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

SAM

Do you remember the last time you

saw him?

MINNIE

I seen him in our place the last

week before he gone missin'.

MINNIE

He used to come in whilst we was in

full swing, make people nervous. Had

him a smile like the Grim Reaper--

DISSOLVE TO:

MINNIE (V.O.)

--just sit back with his hand on

that big ol' gun and act the kingfish

with everybody. Otis Payne had come

to work for us by then, and that boy

had him some attitude--

WADE

Pour it.

WADE

Pour it.

WADE

I know you?

YOUNG OTIS

Name's Otis.

WADE

Otis what?

YOUNG OTIS

Payne.

WADE

One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

YOUNG OTIS

Uh-huh.

WADE

I sent your Daddy to the farm once.

YOUNG OTIS

I know that.

WADE

Why you think that was?

YOUNG OTIS

Some crop needed pickin' and the man

was shorthanded.

WADE

As I remember it was because he had

a sassy mouth on him. Must run in

the family--You wouldn't be runnin'

numbers out of this club, now, would

you, son?

YOUNG OTIS

Runnin' numbers illegal.

WADE

Runnin' numbers without I know about

it is both illegal and unhealthy.

You remember that.

WADE

Whoah, son. You're not finished.

Pour his.

YOUNG HOLLIS

I prefer it in the bottle--

WADE

Shut up, Hollis. Pour.

WADE

How come you don't took familiar?

YOUNG OTIS

Been away. Up to Houston.

WADE

Houston, huh? I hear they let you

boys run wild up there.

WADE

Aw--look what you done now. Better

get something to wipe it up, son.

YOUNG OTIS

You spilt it, you wipe it up.

WADE

I told you to do something. Are you

gonna hop to it, or are we gonna

have a problem?

WADE

Don't want to turn tail in front of

your people. I understand.

WADE

Come on, Houston, give it a try!

Come to Poppa--

RODERICK

Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just

a bit slow, is all. He don't mean

nothin' by it--

WADE

That the problem, son?  You Slow?

RODERICK

Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--

RODERICK

You got him too scared to peep,

Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun

up--

WADE

You telling me what to do, Roderick?

RODERICK

No, Sheriff, I'm just--

WADE

What's this I see? Is that whiskey

in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick,

I'm gonna have to cite you for a

violation of state law--

RODERICK

This is a club, Sheriff--you been in

here--

WADE

And people better clear out of here!

Now!

WADE

You learn how to act your place,

son. This idn't Houston.

OTIS (V.O.)

'Course I was young and full of beans

then--

OTIS

I didn't understand the spot I was

putting Roderick in.

SAM

And that was the last time you saw

him?

OTIS

Oh--I think he came in one more time

with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy

wasn't with them. Made their monthly

pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just

kept my mouth good and shut and handed

over that envelope.

SAM

That was the night he disappeared?

OTIS

(Shakes his head)

Could of been. That was white people's

business.

SAM

And when my father was Sheriff?

OTIS

What about it?

SAM

What was your deal with him?

OTIS

Buddy was more a part of the big

picture--county political machine,

chamber of commerce, zoning board if

I kept those people happy, he was

pretty much on my side.

(Smiles)

Whenever somebody thought--they start

up another bar for the black  folks,

they'd be--how should I put this?

They'd be officially discouraged.

SAM

He ever accept cash for a favor?

OTIS

I don't recall a prisoner ever died

in your father's custody. I don't

recall a man in this town--Black,

White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a

minute before they'd call on Buddy

Deeds to solve a problem. More than

that I wouldn't like to say.

AMADO

If you had your way I wouldn't have

any friends.

PILAR

Oh, come on, Amado--

AMADO

Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss

Honor Roll here--

PILAR

Leave your sister out of it.

AMADO

You and all of the teachers in this

dump--your story's over, so you don't

want anybody else to have fun.

PALOMA

You jerk--

AMADO

I'm not talking to you. You don't

have any friends.

PALOMA

Who'd want to be friends with that

bunch of pachuco wannabes?

AMADO

I don't pretend I came over on the

Mayflower--

PALOMA

And those stupid girls who hang out

with them--

AMADO

Just shut up.

PALOMA (O.S.)

Joanie Orozco's telling the whole

school she's like desperately in

love with Santo Guerra.

AMADO (O.S.)

So?

PALOMA (O.S.)

It's pathetic. You can't be

desperately in love when you're 14

years old.

PALOMA

Not if you have half a brain in your

head.

PILAR

Of course you can.

PALOMA

What?

PILAR

It doesn't have anything to do with

being smart.

JORGE

What I'm saying is, I don't see the

point. You had your chance when the

dedication committee was meeting--

DANNY

I've got new information--

H.L.

It's ancient goddarn history, Danny--

DANNY

1963, they dam up the north branch

to make Lake Pescadero. A whole little

town disappears--

H.L.

Squatter town--

DANNY

People had been living in Perdido

for over a hundred years. Mexicans

and Chicanos are deported, evicted,

moved forcibly out of their houses

by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and

his department--

JORGE

There was a bill from the state

legislature--

DANNY

Families were split apart, a whole

community was destroyed--

H.L.

They were trespassing, Danny--

DANNY

--and who ends up with lakefront

property bought for a fraction of

the market price? Buddy Deeds, Sheriff

of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy,

Hollis Pogue.

SAM

You finished?

DANNY

Look, I'm not after you, Sam.  I

just think people in town ought to

know the full story on Buddy Deeds.

SAM

(Nods)

That makes two of us.

H.L.

You best be thankful that's the son

and not the father. Buddy woulda

kicked your ass from here to sundown.

CELIE (O.S.)

I don't see what the big deal is. Go

back over, talk to the man, and bury

the hatchet, Del--

DEL

Otis Payne was never embarrassed

about a thing in his life.

CHET

Dad--

CELIE (O.S.)

You were 8 years old when he left--

DEL

He didn't leave, he moved three houses

down with one of my mother's best

friends.

CHET

Dad--?

DEL

"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"

DEL (O.S.)

Everybody else's business. And

everybody loved Big O--

DEL

Big O was always there with a  smile

or a loan or a free drink.

CHET

Dad, can I talk to you about track?

CELIE (O.S.)

People change.

DEL

Not that much.

CHET

Dad, I talked to the track coach--

DEL

I thought we already had this out?

Next year, if your grades are high

enough--

CHET

I have a B average.

DEL

How many B-average students do you

think they take at West Point?

CELIE (O.S.)

We're going to have to see him.

DEL

No, we don't.

ENRIQUE

Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas

seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y

pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday

night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll

cross in the morning and then we'll

have to wait--]

MERCEDES

Off the phone, by we've got people

waiting. Andale!

MERCEDES

Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere

matar a mis clientes? [Where are

your gloves? Stupid! You want to

kill my customers?]

MERCEDES

These ones coming up are getting

stupider every year.

PILAR

Maybe you're just getting less

patient.

MERCEDES

If they're going to survive here,

they have to know how to work, Elalco!

Adelante! Los clientes esperan!

PILAR

Well, you hire illegals--

MERCEDES

(Indignant)

Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've

got green cards, they've got relatives

who were born here--if they only had

a little common sense I'd be very

happy.

PILAR

If you spent a little more time

training them--

MERCEDES

Did you come here to tell me how to

run my business?

PILAR

No. I was wondering if you'd like to

take a trip down south with us. Maybe

see where you grew up--

MERCEDES

Why would I want to go there?

PILAR

Oh, come on--you must be curious how

it's changed. Amado is into this big

Tejano roots thing and I've never

been further than Ciudad Leon--

MERCEDES

You want to see Mexicans, open your

eyes and look around you. We're up

to our ears in them.

PILAR

Mami, how old were you when my father--

MERCEDES

He was killed.

PILAR

Right. When he was killed.

MERCEDES

A little older than Paloma is now.

PILAR

How come you never got married again?

PILAR

There must have been somebody.

MERCEDES

(Mutters)

I was too busy.

PILAR

Nobody's too busy.

MERCEDES

Maybe now. It was different back

then. I had this place, I was doing

all the shopping, all the cooking.

What do I need some chulo with grease

under his nails to drink up the

profit?

PILAR

(Pissed off)

Thank you.

MERCEDES

I don't mean Fernando.

PILAR

Mami, the first time I brought him

home, those were your exact words--

"some chulo with grease under his

nails."

MERCEDES

I never said that.

PILAR

You made it pretty damn clear you

thought he was nobody.

MERCEDES

I felt that you could do better for

yourself--

PILAR

What? Become a nun? You didn't want

me going out with Anglos--

MERCEDES

I never said that. It was just that

boy--

PILAR

"That boy"--Mami, say his name for

chrissakes!

MERCEDES

You people are stealing my money--

Entiende? Robandome?

GIRL

Su madre? [Your mother?]

PILAR

Si.

GIRL

Lo siento [My condolences.]

CODY

Now I'm just as liberal as the next

guy--

SAM

If the next guy's a redneck.

CODY

--but I gotta say I think there's

something to this cold climate

business. I mean, you go to the beach-

what do you do? Drink a few beers,

wait for a fish to flop up on the

sand. Can't build no civilization

that way. You got a hard winter

coming, though, you got to plan ahead,

and that gives your cerebral cortex

a workout.

SAM

Good deal you were born down here,

then.

CODY

You joke about it, Sam, but we are

in a state of crisis. The lines of

demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run

a sucessfull civilization you got to

have lines of demarcation between

right and wrong, between this one

and that one--your Daddy understood

that. He was like the whatchacallit--

the referee for this damn menudo we

got down here. He understood how

most people don't want their sugar

and salt in the same jar.

SAM

You mixed drinks bad as you mix

metaphors, you be out of a job.

CODY

Take that pair over in the corner--

CODY

Place like this, twenty years ago,

Buddy woulda been, on them two--

CODY (O.S.)

--warning. Not 'cause he had it in

for the colored

CODY

--but just as a kind of safety tip.

SAM

Yeah. I bet he would.

CODY

Old Sam stood for somethin', you

know? The day that man died they

broke the goddamn mold.

PRISCILLA

So where does that put us?

CLIFF

Well--I don't see what's changed. No -

PDA's, no necking on the obstacle

course.

PRISCILLA

Seriously.

CLIFF

Seriously, I think we should get

married.

PRISCILLA

We been through this before--

CLIFF

We should just do it.

PRISCILLA

And if I get a shot at a promotion

somewhere--

CLIFF

You could take it--

PRISCILLA

It's up or out these days, Cliff.

Say I get transferred to a different

post--

CLIFF

I'd quit the Army for you, if it

came to that.

PRISCILLA

(Grins)

Man's gonna retire in two years and

he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.

SAM (O.S.)

Excuse me--

CLIFF

Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this

is Priscilla Worth.

SAM

Pleased to meet you.

CLIFF

Sheriff Deeds was in on our

archeological find yesterday.

PRISCILLA

It true they gonna build a shopping

mall out there?

SAM

If certain people have their way,

it's going to be a new jail.

PRISCILLA

Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong

business. They closin' down military

bases left and right, puttin' up

jails like 7-11 stores.

SAM

Do either of you have any idea when

they stopped using that site as a

rifle range?

CLIFF

They stopped training infantry there

in the late '50s. It was just a

playground for the jackrabbits till

they gave it to the county last year.

PRISCILLA

You know who it was they dug up?

SAM

Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish

they hadn't.

ENRIQUE

Es muy lindo, su coche--

MERCEDES

En ingles Enrique. This is the United

States. We speak English.

ENRIQUE

Is very beautiful, your car.

MERCEDES

Good night, Enrique. She slides into

the car--

ENRIQUE

Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique

walks in the opposite direction--

FADE OUT

OTIS

Carolyn--knock that off for a minute.

DEL

Black Seminoles?

OTIS

(Shrugs)

Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts,

couple pieces one of your men out at

the base made. Free admission.

DEL

That where he was shot?

OTIS

That's where he fell.

DEL

You get much of that in here?

OTIS

It's a bar. People come together,

drink, fall in love, fall out of

love, air their grudges out--

DEL

Deal drugs in the bathroom--

OTIS

If I thought it would help I'd put

up a sign telling them not to. Right

under the one about the employees

washing their hands.

OTIS

This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is

my son, Delmore.

DEL

Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

CAROLYN

I'll be in back waiting for that

delivery.

OTIS

So.

DEL

So tell me why I shouldn't make this

place off-limits.

OTIS

This is an official visit, then--

DEL

I assume a lot of your business is

from our people.

OTIS

Your boys out there cooped up

together, need somewhere they can

let the steam out. If they're Black,

there's not but one place in this

town they feel welcome. Been that

way since before you were born.

DEL

We have an enlisted man's club at

the post.

OTIS

Well, you're the Man out there now,

aren't you? It's your call.

DEL

That's right.

OTIS

(Smiles)

I been hearing rumors about this new

commander coming for a couple weeks

now. Boys say they heard he's a real

hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full-

bird colonel name of Payne, they say--

Bet you never figured you end up

back here.

DEL

The Army hands you a command, you go

wherever it is.

OTIS

Right.

DEL

I hear things, too.  People call

you the Mayor of Darktown.

OTIS

(Shrugs)

Over the years, this is the one place

that's always been there. I loan a

little money out, settle some

arguments. Got a cot in the back-

people get afraid to go home they

can spend the night. There's not

enough of us to run anything in this

town- the white people are mostly

out on the lake now and the Mexicans

hire each other. There's the Holiness

Church and there's Big O's place.

DEL

And people make their choice--

OTIS

(Smiles)

A lot of 'em choose both. There's

not like a borderline between the

good people and the bad people--you're

not either on one side or the other--

OTIS

(Softly)

I gonna meet that family of yours?

DEL

Why would you want to do that?

OTIS

Because I'm your father.

DEL

You'll get official notification

when I make my decision. He is out

the door--Otis pulls himself a beer

as Carolyn steps back out--

CAROLYN

So that's him--

OTIS

Yeah--that's him. Got two, three

thousand people under him out there,

you count the civilians.

CAROLYN

That must be a laugh a minute.

H.L. (O.S.)

Sheriff!

H.L.

Historic occasion, isn't it?

SAM

Seems like we have another one every

week.

H.L.

Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce

boys got to keep things hummin'--

JORGE

We're building up tourism, Sam--

SAM

People come here to catch bass and

to get laid at the Boy's Town in

Cuidad Leon--

JORGE

Sam--

SAM

You ought to put up a banner--

"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-

Rate Pussy"--

H.L.

That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

SAM

Rather have that than the ten-foot-

high catfish statue--

JORGE

I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel

to kill that story.

SAM

The Perdido thing?

JORGE

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

SAM

Danny's gonna be out for blood the

next time.

H.L.

Which is why we need to talk to you

about the new jail--just so we're

all on the same page.

SAM

We don't need a new jail.

H.L.

That's a matter of interpretation--

SAM

We're already renting cells to the

Feds for their overflow--

JORGE

There was a mandate in the last

election--

SAM

It wouldn't happen to be your

construction company gonna get the

bid on building this thing, would

it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be

thinking about a couple dozen new

jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

H.L.

Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned

about crime--

SAM

We need a drug rehab program, we

need a new elementary school--

JORGE

There isn't money allocated for that.

But a jail--

SAM

Look, I'm not gonna campaign against

your deal here, but if anybody asks

me, I got to tell them the truth. We--

don't--need--a new jail.

H.L.

When we backed you--

SAM

When you backed me you needed

somebody named Deeds to bump the

other fella out of office.  Hey,

folks--

SAM

Let's get this thing over with.

MIKEY

Never thought I'd see the day a buddy

of mine was dating a woman with three

up and three down on her shoulder.

CLIFF

I think it's beyond what you'd call

dating.

MIKEY

You going to get married?

CLIFF

(Shrugs)

Maybe.

MIKEY

You met her family? They gonna be

cool about you being a white guy?

CLIFF

Priscilla says they think any woman

over 30 who isn't married must be a

lesbian. She figures they'll be so

relieved I'm a man--

MIKEY

Always heartwarming to see a prejudice

defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But

marriage, man--I did two tours in

Southeast Asia and I was married for

five years--I couldn't tell you which

experience was worse.

CLIFF

Hey, Mikey--

MIKEY

I knew she was Japanese going into

it, but she didn't tell me the ninja

assassin part--

CLIFF

Mikey--

MIKEY

Her parents acted like I was gonna

blow my nose on their curtains--

CLIFF

Mikey--

MIKEY

If I stayed out past ten with the

guys she'd go into her Madame

Butterfly routine--

CLIFF

Mikey look at this--

MIKEY

What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with

bullets here.

CLIFF

It's a .45.

MIKEY

Yeah?

CLIFF

This is the stuff we picked up the

other day, right? The rest of this

is all .30 caliber--

MIKEY

They were using M-1's, yeah--

CLIFF

What's it doing on a rifle range?

MIKEY

We better call that Sheriff.

HOLLIS

Sometime in the early '70s a reporter

from a national magazine was talking

to the governor of our Lone Star

state, and he asked him, "Governor,

what's your ideal of what a real

Texan ought to be?" Governor said,

"That's easy, son- you just go down

to Rio County and get a look at

Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

HOLLIS (O.S.)

Thank you. We've got one more person

to hear from--

HOLLIS

--and he's somebody who probably

knew Buddy better than any of us,

Sam--would you say a few words?

SAM

You folks who remember my father

knew him as Sheriff. But at home he

was also judge, jury

SAM

--and executioner.

SAM

This is a real honor you're doing

him today, and if Buddy was around

I'm sure his hat size would be gettin'

bigger every minute.

SAM (O.S.)

I used to come to this park to hide

from him. Now that you're putting

his name on it--

SAM

I'll have to find someplace new to

duck out.

SAM

I do appreciate it, and wherever he

is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice

for the bunch of you. Thank you.

HOLLIS

And now my fellow Council member and

one of Frontera's most respected

businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz,

will do the honors for us.

BYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)

It does look like old Buddy.

BYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)

Runnin that kid in for loiterin'--

SAM

Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

SAM

Field trip?

PILAR

Lunch hour. My next class isn't till

nine-thirty.

SAM

Want to take a walk?

SAM

Your mother still doesn't like me.

PILAR

I can't name anybody she does like

these days.

SAM

I see she built a place up here by

the river.

PILAR

A real palace. She rattles around

alone in that thing--

SAM

She's done well for herself--on her

own and all--

PILAR

So she tells me three times a week.

PILAR

I thought you got through that pretty

well.

SAM

They cooked the whole thing up without

asking me.

PILAR

People liked him.

SAM

Most people did, yeah.

PILAR

I remember him watching me once.

When I was little--before you and I--

PILAR

I was on the playground with all the

other kids, but I thought he was

only looking at me. I was afraid he

was going to arrest me--he had those

eyes, you know--

SAM

Yeah.

PILAR

Weird what you remember.

SAM

Your boy, there--

PILAR

Amado.

SAM

Nice-looking kid.

PILAR

He hates me.

SAM

No--

PILAR

With Paloma, it's more like she pities

and tolerates me- totally age-

appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's

never been book-smart. Had a hard

time learning to read. Me being a

teacher and caring about those things

is like an embarrassment--like a

betrayal.

SAM

Fernando did okay, and he dropped

out--

PILAR

Fernando wasn't pissed off at

everybody. He just wanted to fix

their cars.

SAM

It might just be the age. I spent my

first fifteen years trying to be

just like Buddy and the next fifteen

trying to give him a heart attack.

PILAR

So why did you come back here, Sam?

SAM

Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work

for my father-in-law anymore. The

fellas down here said they'd back me--

PILAR

You don't want to be Sheriff.

SAM

I got to admit it's not what I thought

it'd be. Back When Buddy had it--

hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-

room hotel with bars on the windows.

PILAR

It can happen so sudden, can't it?

Being left out on your own.

SAM

You've got your mother, your kids--

PILAR

They've got me. Different thing.

SAM

Remember this?

PILAR

I should get back.

SAM

Pilar--

PILAR

Looks real bad if the teacher's late

for class. It's really nice to talk

with you, Sam.

YOUNG SAM

You going to tell her?

YOUNG PILAR

You going to tell him?

YOUNG SAM

He doesn't need to know all my

business.

YOUNG PILAR

He's gonna find out.

YOUNG SAM

So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?

YOUNG PILAR

It's supposed to be some big sin,

even if you love each other.

YOUNG SAM

You believe that?

YOUNG PILAR

No.

SAM

Me neither.

PRISCILLA

Private Johnson!

ATHENA

Sergeant?

PRISCILLA

Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

ATHENA

I'm feeling okay--

PRISCILLA

I'm very happy to hear that, Private.

Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup

for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling

okay, too.

ATHENA

(Reacts)

You're testing me?

PRISCILLA

You and one hundred nineteen other

fortunate individuals. Put it in

gear.

ATHENA

Yes, Sergeant.

RAY

Excellent performance, my friend.

The judge was very impressed.

SHADOW

You don't need to cuff me.

RAY

You been talking so much trash today,

you made us think you're a dangerous

criminal. Be a good boy, now--

SHADOW

You're the one who's a good boy. Man

say "fetch" and you fetch--

RAY

Just doing my job.

SHADOW

White man just using you to keep the

Black man down.

RAY

This isn't Houston, my friend. We

pretty much running things now. Our

good day has come.

SHADOW

You suckers haven't had a good day

since the Alamo.

RAY

Andale, amigo,

SAM

Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--

MERCEDES

Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks

again--]

MERCEDES

Hello? Border Patrol?

WADE

Who is that? Come out here where I

can see you!

WADE

You sonofabitch--

PATROLMAN (O.S.)

Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba!

Sam, squinting toward the light to

see who it is, raises his hands over

his head--

ZACK (O.S.)

Get that thing off 'im! He's one of

ours--

SAM

Zack?

ZACK

Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.

SAM

What's up?

ZACK

We had about a dozen wets come over

just upriver. They ran into one of

our posts--it was like a breakshot

on a pool table, illegals runnin'

every which way.

SAM

I haven't seen anybody come by.

ZACK

We'll get 'em--

(Looks around)

So you livin' out here now?

SAM

Yeah. It's quiet--

ZACK

I heard about that deal for your

father--You must be real proud.

SAM

Sure.

ZACK

The stories people tell, he was a

real colorful fella--

PATROLMAN (O.S.)

Zack! We got one!

ZACK

Well--back on the clock. You see any

of our neighbors from the south, let

'em know I'm lookin' for 'em.

SAM

'Night--

PALOMA (O.S.)

Mom?

PILAR

Yeah?

PALOMA (O.S.)

You gonna stay out here?

PILAR

For a while.

PALOMA (O.S.)

What's she singing about?

PILAR

(Smiles)

What do you think?

FADE OUT

SAM

First bullet entered beneath the

left eye, severing the optical nerve

and exiting from top rear of skull

causing tissue damage

SAM (O.S.)

--and severe cerebral hemorrhaging.

Second bullet entered left cheek

driving fragment of upper and lower

molars into base of skull. Third

bullet--

PETE

Morning, Sheriff.

SAM

Hey, Pete. How's it going?

PETE

Time marches on.

SAM

How much you got left?

PETE

Three months.

SAM

You stop growing that loco weed at

your place, you'd see a lot more

daylight.

PETE

It was for personal consumption.

SAM

You're going to smoke an acre and a

half of marijuana?

PETE

I got a bad stomach. It helps me

digest.

PETE

Your father never bothered me about

it. Leastways not till the drug people

got on his back in the late '60s.

SAM

I thought he busted you a couple

times.

PETE

Different charge. I had a still.

Made my own mescal.

PETE

That's how I ruined my stomach.

SAM

(Smiles)

I'm surprised he bothered with it.

PETE

He was afraid I was going to poison

somebody. Your father tried to do

good for people--

SAM

So I've heard--

PETE

And your mother was a saint. That

summer I built the patio at your

house? She made me lunch every day.

SAM

Well, you were working there--

PETE

It could have just been a box lunch

from the jail.

SAM

You built our patio while you  were

on the county?

PETE

Out in the fresh air, nice gringo

lady making you pies--who's gonna

sit back in a little jail cell all

day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no

hay dos. And after that cabron Charley

Wade--

SAM

I've heard Wade was a bit tough on

the Mexicans--

PETE

He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough

enough for you?

SAM

Murdered him?

PETE

Chucho Montoya saw it with his own

eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

RAY

You're out early.

SAM

Yeah.

RAY

Haven't seen much of you at the jail

lately.

SAM

I been working on a few things.

RAY

Uh-huh.

SAM

I'm going over to the other side.

RAY

(Concerned)

The Republicans?

SAM

No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to

somebody.

RAY

They got telephones.

SAM

Gotta be in person.

RAY

Oh.

RAY

Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge

and H.L. and all--they asked me--

SAM

They want you to stand for Sheriff

next election.

RAY

Yeah.

SAM

You'd do a good job.

RAY

How 'bout you?

SAM

Don't know if I'll still want it.

RAY

I didn't want to be going around

your back.

SAM

I appreciate you telling me.

SAM

You think we need a new jail?

RAY

Well, it's a complicated issue--

SAM

Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a

Sheriff.

PILAR

I'm only going to have you for two

more years. If you decide not to go

on to college--

AMADO

I can't take any more school.

PILAR

--you're going to be on your own.

AMADO

So?

PILAR

So I'm worried about you. I don't

want you to end up in jail like your

friends.

AMADO

They're not going to jail.

PILAR

Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew

how they got all those things.

AMADO

Just some rich Anglo out on the lake.

Don't even live here all year.

PILAR

That makes it okay?

AMADO

They stole our land--

PILAR

Save your breath. That line doesn't

cut it with me.

PILAR

How do you think you're going to

make a living?

AMADO

I can fix cars.

PILAR

You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn

told me that the cars they're making

now are all computerized--

AMADO

You think I can't learn that?

PILAR

I think you can learn whatever you

want to. I just don't see you doing

it. If you want to settle for--

AMADO

I'm not settling for anything. I

like cars, it's just not a move up

the ladder to you, so you think it's

a waste.

PILAR

That isn't true.

AMADO

Oh, come on--you and Grandma think

anybody who works with their hands

is a peasant. When Dad--

PILAR

If you grew up to he anywhere near

as good a man as your father was, I

would be happy! I would be thrilled.

AMADO

It's my life. If I want to fuck it

up, that's my business.

PILAR

(Nods)

I said pretty much the same thing to

my mother when I was your age.

AMADO

And what did she do?

PILAR

Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of

Perpetual Help.

AMADO

Catholic school, nasty.

PILAR

Honey, I think you're smart and you're

good and I love you. So don't act

like an idiot, all right?

CHUCHO (O.S.)

Over here we don't throw everything

away like you gringos do.

CHUCHO

Recycling, right? We invented that.

The government doesn't have to tell

people to do it.

SAM

You own this place?

CHUCHO

This place, the one across the street,

four other ones around Ciudad Leon--

soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of

the Tires. Lots of your people rollin'

back over that bridge on my rubber.

SAM

(Nods)

You lived in the States for a while?

CHUCHO

Fifteen years in El Paso.

SAM

Made some money, came back here--

CHUCHO

Something like that.

SAM

You ever know a fella named Eladio

Cruz?

CHUCHO

You the sheriff of Rio County, right?

Un jefe muy respetado. Step over

this line.

CHUCHO

Ay, que milagro! You're not the

Sheriff of nothing anymore- just

some tejano with a lot of questions

I don't have to answer.

CHUCHO

Bird flying south-you think he sees

that line? Rattlesnake, javelina--

whatever you got--halfway across

that line they don't start thinking

different. So why should a man?

SAM

Your government always been pretty

happy to have that line. The

question's just been where to draw

it

CHUCHO

My government can go fuck itself,

and so can yours. I'm talking about

people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio

Cruz is giving some friends of his a

lift in his camion one day--

CHUCHO (V.O.)

--but because he's on one side of

this invisible line and not the other,

they got to hide in the back like

criminals--

CHUCHO (V.O.)

And because over there he's just

another Mex bracero, any man with a

badge is his jefe--

ELADIO

Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar

escondido! [Shit, CHUCHO you got to

stay hidden!]

YOUNG CHUCHO

Voy a romper las rinones si no hago

pipi--[I'm gonna bust my kidneys if

I don't pee--]

YOUNG CHUCHO

Los demas son tan espantados que

prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [The

other guys are so scared they'd rather

wet their pants.]

YOUNG CHUCHO

Mira, Eladio [Look!]

ELADIO

(Calling from where

he lies changing the

tire)

Muchachos! Escondases! [Boys! Hide

yourselves!]

WADE

Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta?

[Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

ELADIO

No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No

problem, I've got another.]

WADE

What's in the back?

ELADIO

Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

WADE

I heard somebody been haulin' wets

on this road.

ELADIO

I haven't seen anybody doing that.

WADE

This same person been bragging all

over the county how he don't have to

cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it--

he can run his own operation 'thout

any help. Como se llama, amigo?

ELADIO

Eladio Cruz.

WADE

You know this road got a bad

reputation, Eladio--

ELADIO

Reputation?

WADE

Bandidos, Injuns--

WADE

There's many an unfortunate soul

been ambushed out on this stretch.

Hope you're carrying some protection.

ELADIO

Protection?

WADE

You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't

lie to me now.

ELADIO

Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

WADE

Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me

take a look at that.

YOUNG HOLLIS

Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord--

WADE

Little greaser sonofabitch been

running a goddarn bus service. Think

he can make a fool out of Charley

Wade! Get them wets outta the back,

Hollis, see what we've got--

YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)

You killed him--

WADE (O.S.)

You got a talent for statin' the

obvious, son Muchachos! Venga

afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out!

Hands up!]

HOLLIS (O.S.)

Hooligans--

HOLLIS

It happens again, we build a fence

around it.

ZACK

Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero

la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win

a lot of battles but the war's already

been lost--]

ENRIQUE

You wan' something to drink?

WESLEY (O.S.)

The longhorns go for ten times the

price--

WESLEY

--but longhorns are hard to come by

these days.

SAM

You sell much out here?

WESLEY

How am I gonna sell things if nobody

comes by? This stretch of road runs

between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

SAM

Hell of a spot to put a business.

WESLEY

But you don't see much competition,

do you?

WESLEY

These things used to sell like

hotcakes. Now, if it can't play those

discs, they won't look at it.

WESLEY

I like it here. Once I tried going

onto that reservation to live.

Couldn't take the politics. Damn

Indian'll drive you crazy with that,

Now your father--this wasn't what he

had in mind at all. He come out of

Korea, he had this Chevy with too

much engine in it. He'd come roarin'

up and down this road all hours of

the day and night,looking for somebody

to race.

WESLEY

Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe

told me he sells these as fast as

the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

SAM

So when did Buddy leave?

WESLEY

For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember

dates no more. I do recall it was

after an affair of the heart had

gone sour on him. He almost took

some poor fella's head off at the

Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured

it was time to move on.

SAM

You think he killed anybody in Korea?

WESLEY

They don't hand those medals out for

hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy

this?

SAM

No--

WESLEY

Me neither.

WESLEY

If he hadn't found that Deputy job,

I believe Buddy might've gone down

the other path, got into some serious

trouble. Settled him right down.

That and your mother. 'Course he had

that other one later.

SAM

Another woman?

WESLEY

Your mother wasn't one to get chased

off her patch. Half the damn county

knew and nobody thought the worse of

her for seein' it through.

SAM

You know who it was?

WESLEY

The other one? Hell, at my age, every

time you learn a new name you got to

forget an old one. Your head's all

crowded up--here it is--

WESLEY

This big fella was sleepin' in a

crate at Cisco's junkyard right when

I looked to see what was in it. Jumped

up at my face--scared me so bad I

killed him without thinkin'.

WESLEY

Gotta be careful where you're pokin'--

who knows what you'll find.

PILAR

I don't think you can take it

personally--

MOLLY

I'd like to see them spend a day

pulling 14-year-olds off of each

other--I should get combat pay--

PILAR

I have new respect for some of my

kids, meeting the parents they've

been dealt--

PILAR

See you, Molly.

MARISOL

Steve called for you.

PILAR

Steve?

MARISOL

Steve. Board of Education Steve who

likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded

Mexican girls, I can tell.

PILAR

Spanish, please. My mother would

have a heart attack.

MARISOL

Your mother's family is Spanish?

PILAR

Sure, they go back to Cortez. When

he rode by, they were squatting in a

hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

MARISOL

You got to be interested in somebody.

All you do is work.

PILAR

All my mother does is work. That's

how you get to be Spanish.

MARISOL

How 'bout the Sheriff?

PILAR

The Sheriff.

MARISOL

The old-high-school-heartthrob

Sheriff. I thought you were crazy

about each other. He's available,

you're available--

PILAR

I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

MARISOL

You told me one time it was true

love.

PILAR

(Mutters)

Nobody stays in love for twenty-three

years.

BUDDY (O.S.)

Let's go.

BUDDY

Goddammit!

YOUNG SAM

What the hell are you doing? You

fucking asshole!

BUDDY

How old is that girl? Goddammit,

where's your goddam sense?

YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)

Let me go!  Pendejo!

YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)

Come on now, Missy, get your clothes

in order--

YOUNG SAM

You got no fuckin' right! You stay

out of my fuckin' life!

BUDDY

Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn

car keys, son--

YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)

What am I s'posed to do with her,

Buddy?

BUDDY

You drive her home and tell her mother

where we found her--

YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)

Sam!

YOUNG SAM

You leave her the fuck alone!

BUDDY

You just shut that filthy mouth,

son. I'll deal with you when we get

home--

YOUNG PILAR

Please, don't tell my mother! She's

gonna kill me!

PILAR

(Softly)

Follow me.

PILAR

We thought we were something, didn't

we?

SAM

Yeah.

PILAR

I look at my kids in school--tenth,

eleventh graders. That's who we were.

Children.

SAM

Yeah.

PILAR

I mean what did we know about

anything?

SAM

Nothing.

PILAR

When Nando died--it was so sudden--I

was kind of in shock for awhile.

Then I woke up and there was the

whole rest of my life and I didn't

have any idea what to do with it.

SAM

You know the other day, you asked

why I came back?

PILAR

Yeah?

SAM

I came back 'cause you were here.

PILAR

My mother hasn't changed the songs

since I was 10.

PILAR

Wow.

SAM

Yeah.

PILAR

How come it feels the same?

SAM

I don't know. It just feels good.

Always did.

PILAR

So what are we gonna do about this?

SAM

More, I hope.

PILAR

How long have you lived here?

SAM

Two years.

PILAR

There's nothing on the walls. No

pictures--

SAM

Don't have kids. Other pictures--I

don't know--it's nothing I want to

look back on.

PILAR

Like your story is over.

SAM

I've felt that way, yeah.

PILAR

It isn't. Not by a long shot. He

holds her and they lie silently for

a moment--

SAM

Pilar--

PILAR

Yeah?

SAM

What was your father's name?

PILAR

Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

FADE OUT:

PALOMA

She finally got in--

PILAR

It's Saturday.

PALOMA

You got in late last night.

PILAR

Yeah. I had uhm--school business.

PALOMA

Can I get this?

PILAR

Nobody really wears that stuff,

Paloma.

PALOMA

I could name five girls at school

who have one just like it--

PILAR

Enough with the clothes--

PALOMA

Just 'cause you went to Catholic

school and wore a uniform.

PILAR

I only went for my last two years.

PALOMA

How come?

PILAR

Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away

from away from boys.

PALOMA

Did it work?

SAM

Morning, Hollis.

HOLLIS

Sam! Quite a do the other day. It

meant a lot to folks that you said

something.

SAM

You thought any more about our murder?

HOLLIS

We have a murder?

SAM

Charley Wade.

HOLLIS

I wish I could tell you I remembered

something new, but I can't.

SAM

I got an idea what happened.

HOLLIS

Do you?

SAM

I think somewhere between Roderick

Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade

ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy

put a bullet in him, waited for him

to die, threw him in the trunk of

the Sheriff's car and drove him out

by the Army post, I think he buried

him under four feet of sand and never

looked back.

HOLLIS

You lived in the man's house what--

seventeen, eighteen years? And you

didn't get to know him any better

than that?

SAM

I got to go see somebody in San

Antonio today. Your memory gets any

better, I'll be back tonight.

OTIS (O.S.)

That's John Horse.

OTIS

Spanish in Florida called him Juan

Caballo. John Horse.

CHET

(Looks at picture)

He a Black man or an Indian?

OTIS

(Steps in)

Both.

OTIS

He was part of the Seminole Nation,

got pushed down into the Everglades

in pioneer days. African people who

run off from the slaveholders hooked

up with them, married up, had

children. When the Spanish give up

Florida, the U.S.Army come down to

move all them Indian peoples off to

Oklahoma--

CHET

The Trail of Tears.

OTIS

(Smiles)

They teaching that now?  Good. Only

a couple of 'em held out--this man,

John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat,

and a fella name of Osceola. Army

put all of them in prison and Osceola

died, but them other two escaped and

put together a fighting band and

held out another ten, fifteen years.

Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops

at Lake Okeechobee.

CHET

So they stayed in Florida?

OTIS

They got tired of fighting, went to

the Indian Territories for a while.

But the slave-raiders were on 'em

even there, and one night they packed

up and nearly the whole band rode

down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle

Pass.

OTIS

Men worked for Santa Anna down there,

waited out the Civil War. The land

wasn't much to feed people on, so in

1870 they come north and put up at

Fort Duncan and the men joined up

what was called the Seminole Negro

Indian Scouts. Best trackers either

side of the border. Bandits, rustlers,

Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--

CHET

They fought against the Indians?

OTIS

Same as they done in Mexico.

CHET

But they were Indians themselves.

OTIS

They were in the Army. Like your

father.

CHET

(Surprised)

You know who I am?

OTIS

I got a pretty good guess.

CHET

That guy who got shot--

OTIS

You didn't go telling your father

you were here?

CHET

Are you kidding? And face a court-

martial?

OTIS

(Smiles)

He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

CHET

No sports if I don't keep a B average,

no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

OTIS

PDA?

CHET

Public Display of Affection. Every

time he moves up a rank, it's like

he's got to tighten the screws a

little more--

OTIS

Well--

CHET

I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you

know--

OTIS

Didn't have a father?

CHET

(Shrugs)

He's still pissed off about it.

OTIS

When you're his age you'll still be

pissed off about him.

CHET

So how come you got into all this?

OTIS

These are our people. There were

Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras

Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--

Congressional Medal Of Honor--

CHET

So I'm part-Indian?

OTIS

By blood you are. But blood only

means what you let it.

CHET

My father says the day you're  born

you start from scratch, no breaks

and no excuses, and you got to pull

yourself up on your own.

OTIS

(Sad)

Well, he's living proof of that,

son. Living proof.

DEL

Private Johnson, are you unhappy in

the Army?

ATHENA

No, sir--

DEL

Then how would you explain the fact

that out of one hundred twenty people

we tested, you're the only one who

came up positive for drugs?

ATHENA

I'm sorry, sir.

DEL

When you were given the opportunity

to enlist, a kind of contract was

agreed upon. I think the Army has

honored its part of that agreement.

ATHENA

Yes, sir--

DEL

Do you believe in what we're doing

here, Private Johnson?

ATHENA

I-I can do the job, sir.

DEL

You don't sound too enthusiastic.

ATHENA

I am, sir.

DEL

What exactly do you think your job

is, Private?

ATHENA

Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

DEL

Who's "they"?

ATHENA

The--the officers.

DEL

And that's the job? Nothing about

serving your country?

DEL

These aren't trick questions, Private.

You'll be given an Article 15 and be

going into the ADCAP Program one way

or the other. What happens after

that is up to you. I'm just trying

to understand how somebody like you

thinks.

DEL

Well?

ATHENA

(Hesitant)

You really want to know, sir?

DEL

Please.

ATHENA

It's their country. This is one of

the best deals they offer.

DEL

How do you think I got to be a

colonel?

ATHENA

Work hard, be good at your job. Sir.

Do whatever they tell you.

DEL

Do whatever they tell you--

ATHENA

I mean, follow orders, sir.

DEL

With your attitude, Private, I'm

surprised you want to stay in the

service.

ATHENA

I do, sir.

DEL

Because it's a job?

ATHENA

(Struggling)

Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--

DEL

Chaos.

DEL

Why do you think they let us in on

the "deal"?

ATHENA

They got people to fight. Arabs,

yellow people, whatever. Might as

well use us.

DEL

Do you think you've been discriminated

against on this post?

ATHENA

No, sir. Not at all.

DEL

Any serious problems with your

sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

ATHENA

No, sir. They all been real straight

with me.

DEL

It works like this, Private--every

soldier in a war doesn't have to

believe in what he's fighting for.

Most of them fight just to back up

the soldiers in their squad--you try

not to get them killed, try not to

get them extra duty, try not to

embarrass yourself in front of them.

DEL

Why don't you start with that?

ATHENA

Yes, sir.

DEL

You're dismissed, Private.

ATHENA

Thank you, sir.

DRIVER (O.S.)

--Julia es demasiado flaca para mime

gusto mas mujeres con algo en frente--

o muy altas como Cindy Crofor.

Quisiera montar esa caballa--[Julia's

too skinny for me--I like women with

something up front--or really tall

like Cindy Crawford. I'd like to

ride that horse--]

BUNNY

The Longhorns gonna kick some serious

butt this Saturday, you just watch.

We got a kid at tailback from down

your way--outta El Indio--

SAM (O.S.)

That's in Maverick County.

BUNNY

Oh. Right. And you're in--?

SAM

Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea

Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft

hands, lateral movement--the whole

package. Only a sophomore--

SAM

You still going to all the home games?

BUNNY

Well, Daddy's got his box at the

stadium, of course, and I'll fly to

the Cowboy away games when they're

in the Conference. Then there's the

high school on Friday' nights. West

Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like

a cat. High school, we're talkin'.

Guess how much he can bench-press?

SAM

Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same

medication?

BUNNY

Do I seem jumpy?

SAM

No, you look good. I was just

wondering.

BUNNY

Last year was awful rough--Mama

passing on and the whole business

with O.J.--I mean it's not like it

was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach

or one of our own boys, but it really

knocked me for a loop--

SAM

You look good--

BUNNY

--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped

to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in

some lucky shit before he kicked

that goal--

SAM

Yeah, well--

BUNNY

--they hadn't pulled me off that

woman I would have jerked a knot in

her.

SAM

You were in a fight--

BUNNY

Daddy calls it an "altercation." How

you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

SAM

Same weight I always was.

BUNNY

You look awful good in that uniform,

though.

SAM

Best part of the job.

BUNNY

Daddy hired a pinhead to take your

job. He says so himself. Says "Even

my son-in-law was better than this

pinhead I got now".

SAM

Bunny, is that stuff I left in the

garage still there?

BUNNY

Least he never called me that. With

me, it was always "high-strung." "My

Bunny might have done something with

her life, she wasn't so high-strung."

Or "tightly wound," that was another

one. You seeing anyone?

SAM

No. You?

BUNNY

Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up.

You aren't talking about money, their

beady little eyes go dead.

SAM

You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one

of your fires, did you? The stuff I

left in the garage--some of it was

my father's--

BUNNY

You watch the draft this year? 'Course

you didn't, idiot question. They try

to make it dramatic, like there's

some big surprise who picks who in

the first round? Only they been

working it over with their experts

and their computers for months.

Doctor's reports, highlight reels,

coaches' evaluations, psychological

profiles--hell, I wouldn't be

surprised if they collected stool

samples on these boys, have 'em

analyzed. All this stuff to pick a

football player for your squad.

Compared to that, what you know about

the person you get married to don't

amount to diddly, does it?

SAM

Suppose not.

BUNNY

You kind of bought yourself a pig in

a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that

time we were first seeing each other

you didn't know I was tightly wound--

SAM

It wasn't just you, Bunny.

BUNNY

No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't

exactly throw yourself into it heart

and soul, did you?

BUNNY

Your shit's still in the garage if

that's what you came for.

BUNNY

350 pounds.

SAM

What?

BUNNY

This boy from West Side, plays tackle

both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds.

You imagine having that much weight

on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard

to breathe. Hard to swallow.

SAM

I think they have another fella there

to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

BUNNY

"I only got my little girl now," he

says, "she's my lifeline." Then he

tells me I can't be in the box anymore

if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch

don't even watch the damn game, just

sits there drinking with his bidness

friends, look up at the TV now and

then. I do better to sit in the cheap

seats with some real football people.

SAM

(Edging out)

You look good, Bunny. It's nice to

see you.

BUNNY

(Smiles)

Thanks. I like it when you say that,

Sam.

ENRIQUE

Todos estamos? [Everybody here?]

ANSELMA

Van a disparar a nosotros? [Are they

going to shoot at us?]

ENRIQUE

Nadie nos veran. Seramos invisibles.

Nobody's going to see us. We'll be

invisible.]

SAM

"Dearest Buddy--"

CAROLYN

Hey, it's the General.

DEL

Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

CAROLYN

Come on in--

DEL

If it's too late--

CAROLYN

Come on in.

CAROLYN

Otis sittin' up with some people at

the club. I don't think he'll be

long.

CAROLYN

His hot sauce recipe won a contest

last year. They sellin' it far away

as San Antonio. He got a lot of

talent, your father.

DEL

You've been in this house for a while?

CAROLYN

I been here with him eight years

now. He built it when he was with

Leora.

DEL

I never met her.

CAROLYN

There was a bunch of 'em You never

met. Me neither.

CAROLYN

Let me show you around--

CAROLYN (O.S.)

He got into all this cowboys and

Indians stuff awhile back. Spend

half his time pokin' around in the

library way up to Austin.

CAROLYN (O.S.)

Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

DEL

Where'd he get all this?

CAROLYN

Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

DEL

Uncle Al--

CAROLYN

Otis stood on good terms with the

man. Whenever you do something makes

the news, he sends it on. When they

made you General, Otis just about

drove away all our customers going

on about it.

DEL

I'm a colonel.

CAROLYN

Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize

the whole damn Army chain of command

before he'd marry me. So this is a

big deal, commander and  all?

DEL

It's a small post and they're phasing

it out in two years, but I moved up

in rank and--well, a command is a

command.

CAROLYN

Otis went on like you were that guy

who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.

DEL

My mother said he never asked about--

CAROLYN

He never asked her.

DEL

Listen, I uh--tell him I came by.

Thanks--

CAROLYN

Catch you later, Colonel.

hands of Senora Cruz.]

MERCEDES

In English, Enrique. In English--

DEL (O.S.)

Homework?

CHET

I finished that. I'm just messing

around.

DEL

Tanks, huh?

CHET

You got to be in the Army, you might

as well have something slick to drive.

DEL

So you're going into the Army?

CHET

That's the general plan, isn't it?

DEL

(Softly)

That's up to you.

DEL

The Army isn't for everybody.

DEL

Not that I don't think you'd be good

at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be

disappointed if you decided to do

something else with your life.

CHET

You wouldn't?

DEL

No.

DEL

How's your room shaping up?

CHET

Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

DEL

Good.

CHET

(Tentative)

Are we going to ever see your father?

DEL

My father.

CHET

Yeah. He lives here, right?

DEL

He does.

DEL

Maybe we'll clean that thing out

back up, have a barbecue next weekend.

We could invite him and his wife

over.

CHET

Cool.

CHET

He makes his own sauce.

SAM

Fellas.

HOLLIS

Hey, Sam.

SAM

Open late.

OTIS

I'm not open. We were just talking.

SAM

Hollis probably told you we found

Charley Wade.

OTIS

Yeah. How about that? People start

digging holes in this county, there's

no telling what'll come up.

SAM

You two saw it, didn't you? You two

saw it when Buddy killed him.

SAM

Imonna find out one way or the other.

HOLLIS

Your father had the finest sense of

justice of any man I ever met--

SAM

Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For

fifteen years the whole damn town

knew he had another woman on the

side. Stole ten thousand dollars to

set her up in business. But hell,

what's that? You got a problem?

Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in

jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--

if you do what he says, when he says.

You got some business that's not

exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--

HOLLIS

Buddy Deeds--

SAM

Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

SAM

That night in the cafe--he didn't

stay long after you left, did he,

Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone

too far with Wade, maybe he figured

he better not wait for the Sheriff

to get behind him. So he stepped out

to see if he could catch up--and you

were here at the club that night,

weren't you, O?

OTIS

I was here.

OTIS (O.S.)

I'd been running a game on the side

after hours craps, draw poker on the

weekends. Roderick didn't know about

it. More important, Charley Wade

didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't

want to cut him in. I suppose I'd

been drinking some, and I was pretty

full of myself in those days--but

hell, I just didn't expect the man

so early--

OTIS

Sheriff Charley had some real big

friends in politics then, and if the

truth come out it wasn't going to go

easy on Hollis.

(He shrugs)

I don't know why I trusted Buddy

with it--don't know why he trusted

me. The first time I ever talked

with him was right there, and then

with a dead white man leakin' blood

on the floor between us. He could

charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy

Deeds.

HOLLIS

The three of us cleaned up and took

him to the post and put him under.

Can't say I was much help.

SAM

And the ten thousand?

HOLLIS

Widow's benefits. He figured it would

make the disappearance look better,

and that Mexican gal was just scrapin'

by after Charley killed her man.

They didn't get hooked up till late--

OTIS

Time went on, people liked the story

that we told better than anything

the truth might have been.

HOLLIS

What's the call, Sam?

SAM

Don't think the Rangers are likely

to find out any more than they

already have.

HOLLIS

Word gets out who that body was,

people are gonna think Buddy done

it.

SAM

Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can

handle it.

SAM

'Night, fellas.

FADE OUT:

PILAR

When's the picture start?

SAM

You gonna tell your mother we been

seeing each other?

PILAR

She'll figure it out sooner or later.

I don't have to ask permission

anymore, if that's what you mean.

SAM

You have any idea when your father

died? Eladio?

PILAR

(Shrugs)

Couple months before I was born--

SAM

Try a year and a half. He bands her

an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--

PILAR

I've never seen my mother in a

bathing suit before.  Didn't know

she owned one.

SAM

Buddy bought the cafe for her with

money he took from the county.

Pilar looks away, struggling not to

cry--

PILAR

They can't pull this on me. It isn't

fair--I don't believe this--

SAM

He paid the hospital bill when you

were born. Your mom always calls you

"our beautiful daughter" in the

letters she wrote to him.

PILAR

From the first time I saw you at

school--all those years we were

married to other people I always

felt like we were connected.

SAM

I remember thinking you were the one

part of my life Buddy didn't have a

piece of--

PILAR

So that's it? You're not going to

want to be with me anymore?

PILAR

I'm not having any more children.

After Amado, I had some complications--

I can't get pregnant again, if that's

what the rule is about--

SAM

If I met you for the first time today,

I'd still want to be with you.

PILAR

We start from scratch--

SAM

Yeah--

PILAR

Everything that went before, all

that stuff, that history--the hell

with it, right?

PILAR

Forget the Alamo.

THE END
