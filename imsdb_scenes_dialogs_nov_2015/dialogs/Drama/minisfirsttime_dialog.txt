MINI'S FIRST TIME

Written by

Nick Guthe

CLOSE ON:

I know what you're thinking. Don't

bullshit me, because I do... You're

please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge

drink right now. I'll jam every

last kernel of popcorn into my

another fucking teenage coming-of-

age story.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Well, relax...no prom night

highjinks, no nerds becoming

popular and no Shakespeare set in

high school...I promise.

A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.

A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a

A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.

An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a

MINI (V.O.)

Since it happened, everyone's

asked me how it all started.

2.

MINI (V.O.)

I suppose the obvious answer is my

eighteenth birthday...

MINI (V.O.)

See, I was blessed with a terrific

mom. Not only is she a lush, but

she also hates me.

MINI (V.O.)

A few days before the party, I

overhear her on the phone ordering

me a male stripper. Nothing says "I

love you" like ten inches of man

meat in your face.

MINI (V.O.)

And knowing dear old ma, she'll try

and nail him after the party...in

my bed.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MINI (V.O.)

That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell,

big shot TV producer and the guy my

mom screws whenever the batteries

run out.

MINI

Yo, bee-ach!

KAYLA

Yo, birthday bee-ach!

MINI

Is it on?

KAYLA

Oh, it's on!

MINI

That's my girl!

MINI (V.O.)

See, to understand me, you need to

understand that life, in my

opinion, is all about new

experiences. "Firsts" is what I

call them.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Somewhere around fourteen, when I

had my first...rhymes with duck, I

realized that the goal of life, any

life, should be to cram as many

"firsts" into it as possible.

DIANE

What the hell are you doing? I said

wait until-

(looking around)

She's not even here, you morons!

CATERER

But, but her friend said--

MINI

SURPRISE!

MINI'S POV:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

That was definitely a first, but

more importantly, it was the first

time I really understood my

potential...And that's when it all

started.

MINI (CONT'D)

(doing her best Donna

Reed)

Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday

ever!

5.

MINI (V.O.)

That little stunt got me grounded

for a week, but it was worth it.

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

See, I just don't understand people

who live their lives as one big

routine.

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They're basically saying "I'm not

worthy of a unique experience on

this earth."...Well, sorry, but I

am.

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The law of firsts has served me

well, because it's liberated me

from the usual pathetic, repetitive

concerns of high school.

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I simply don't care if I'm popular,

because if I did, then I'd be

constantly stressing about whether

my clothes are cool enough, or if

Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know

it yet" quarterback, is gonna call.

6.

KAYLA

(whispering, worried)

Oh, God, it's Troy.

MINI

Just keep walking and don't look at

him.

ROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his

TROY

Yo, Kayla, I got some more of what

you were looking for Saturday

night.

MINI (V.O.)

Ahh...The joys of the American

educational system.

MINI (CONT'D)

(suddenly brightening)

Actually, Troy, I think you

confused her with that senile,

toothless grandmother of yours.

TROY

Yo, Mini, why don't you use that

mouth for something useful and suck

my dick?

MINI

Actually, now that you mention it,

I can't think of anything I'd

rather do than suck your dick.

(CONTINUED)

7.

TROY

Well, it's all for you, babe.

MINI

Really?

TROY

(daring her)

If you can fit it all in.

TROY (CONT'D)

Hey, what the?!

MINI

(grabbing his belt buckle)

I'm going to suck your dick, Troy,

you said I could.

TROY

Yo, this ain't funny!

MINI

No, Troy, I want to suck your dick

right now!

TROY

Jesus, Mini, come on, get off!

MINI

(screaming)

No, Troy! You said I could, now

come on!

(CONTINUED)

8.

MINI

Let's see it! Come on, I want to

suck your throbbing member right

now!

CUT TO:

DIANE (O.S.)

Mini?

DIANE (O.S.)

(screaming)

MINI

WHAT?!

DIANE

When I call you, I expect you to

answer.

MINI

(flatly)

Sorry.

DIANE

Don't patronize me.

MINI

(sugar sweet)

Sorry!

DIANE

If you're trying to get me to call

you a spoiled little ungrateful

bitch, you're out of luck, because

I won't give you the satisfaction.

(CONTINUED)

9.

MINI

Thanks, mommy.

MINI (CONT'D)

What do you want?

DIANE

I'm going out and I need you to

wait for the delivery from the

liquor store. They'll be here by

nine.

MINI

Fine.

DIANE

Just thought you should know, that

makes your thighs look fat.

MINI

(deadpan)

Gosh, you're right, mom, I'm such a

cow.

MINI (V.O.)

It's a freakin' miracle I'm not

anorexic after eighteen years of

her little pep talks.

MINI

Have fun, don't do anything I

wouldn't.

DIANE

(over her shoulder)

Well, that doesn't leave much.

MINI

(under her breath)

Cunt.

10.

her mouth.

MINI (V.O.)

My mother moved out to LA from Ohio

when she was twenty to become an

actress. Even though she was a

total flatliner, somehow she

managed to land a few bit parts on

soaps...without screwing anyone.

MINI (V.O.)

When she gets really sauced, she'll

pop the tapes in and make me watch,

then I'll threaten to call the

suicide hotline.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

After a few years, she got

desperate and spread 'em for this

fat, ugly producer when he promised

to give her a role in some bullshit

cable series that was basically

softcore porn. She got knocked up

with me and he told her she

couldn't be on the show, unless she

hoovered me out.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Excuse me for one sec.

JIMMY

(nervously excited)

Hey, Mini, how you doin'?

MINI

You're late.

11.

MINI (V.O.)

She was gonna do it, too, at least

that what's she told me when she

was feeling particularly loving.

But then she heard rumors the show

wasn't gonna fly and realized

eighteen years of child support

beat thirteen weeks on "Skin

Tight", so I got to stick around.

...Bad choice.

NT. THE WET BAR - LATER.

MINI (V.O.)

Anyway, what Mom didn't count on

was the prick having a heart attack

and croaking a year after I was

born.

MINI (V.O.)

When she tried to collect on his

estate, she found out he'd owed the

government two point five in back

taxes.

(CONTINUED)

12.

MINI (V.O.)

Now, if she had been smart, she

would've set her sights a little

lower and gone after a guy who

would've worshipped the ground she

walked on and wouldn't care that

she already had a kid...

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.)

But not mom, she was gonna bag

another elephant if it meant

gobbling every knob from Hollywood

to the Palisades.

DIANE

Jesus Chr--Mini, why aren't you in

bed?

DIANE

Don't worry, Larry, she's going to

bed, right now. Aren't you?

NT. MINI'S TINY BEDROOM - NIGHT

13.

MINI

Oh, I will...Like some coffee for

the road?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DIANE

Do you want to live in this shit

hole your whole life?

DIANE

Then stay in your fucking room

until they leave. Got it?

14.

MINI (V.O.)

So it pretty much went on like that

until...

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Mini? Diane? I'm home.

MINI (V.O.)

Five years ago, when she met

Martin.

M

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was a win-win...

MINI (V.O.)

He didn't want kids, but needed a

ready-made family to help project

an image of stability for his

corporate outings...We finally got

out of Reseda...

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was great for about a year...

CUT TO:

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then he figured out what he had

married...by then it was too late.

15.

MINI

(breezing past him)

You're home early.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

First time in three months he's

walked in before Letterman. He

totally forgot my birthday party,

and right now I'm thinking his pin

cushion must have given him the

walking papers or...found a new

pin.

MARTIN

Yeah...uh...

(searching)

A dinner with a client got

canceled.

MINI (V.O.)

Bingo.

MINI

Tough day?

MARTIN

About the same...

MINI

Protecting all those poor

defenseless oil companies from

those big bad environmentalists?

M

ARTIN

Someone's got to make the payments

on your Beemer.

MINI (V.O.)

He's a partner at a public

relations firm, which is ironic

because I can't remember the last

time he and my mom were seen in

public together...or had relations.

(CONTINUED)

16.

MARTIN

Is your mother around?

MINI

No, she went to a party off

Beachwood. She was in one of her

"happy moods", so I doubt she'll be

sleeping here...

MARTIN

Oh.

MINI

(innocently)

If you were thinking of inviting a

guest over.

MARTIN

(measured)

I wasn't, but thanks for the

concern...You're going out on a

school night?

MINI

Yeah?

MARTIN

Mmm...Is your homework done?

MINI

Haven't even cracked a book.

MARTIN

(not listening)

Mmm...

MINI (V.O.)

Considering how many guys my mom

has done in his bed, you've got to

admire his resolve. He could've

left her years ago, but with no pre-

nup, he loses half and he just

won't give in.

17.

MINI (V.O.)

Their arrangement actually keeps

everything very calm.

MINI (V.O.)

As I said, the rule of firsts

guides my life. Once you've gotten

into every club in town and had

enough Ivy League lawyers cum too

fast, drastic measures are called

for.

MINI (V.O.)

I thought it would be a goof if I

put a photo ad in one of those 25

cent "outcall" massage newspapers

they sell around town. But I just

got a bunch of pervs breathing

heavy on my voice mail. So I went

to an escort service, and when they

found out I was 18, they told me

they had two tricks in the same

hotel that night...if I was up to

it.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Would you look at them?

(CONTINUED)

18.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to

be, what? At least twenty

eight?...In dog years.

(pausing)

Oh, wait, that would make her four.

MINI (V.O.)

My first night as a call girl was

a serious let down. It turns out

both guys were in town for the

"Promise Keepers" convention.

M

MINI (V.O.)

The first one got so excited I

didn't even get a chance to get my

panties off before he creamed

himself.

MINI (V.O.)

And the other said I looked so much

like his niece, he started

whimpering and praying for

forgiveness.

19.

MINI (V.O.)

Time to bat the eye lashes...

MINI (V.O.)

This? Are you kidding? My first

woman and my first cop?...It

would've been perfect if she hadn't

wanted to cuddle afterwards.

DIANE

(slurring)

Oh...wha- what are you doing here?

ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her insightful

DIANE

Did you have fun, dear?

MINI

Yeah, I turned two tricks and went

down on a dyke cop.

(CONTINUED)

20.

DIANE

Thass nice...

MINI (V.O.)

God, what's gotten into her? She

was almost warm and fuzzy.

MINI (V.O.)

After that night, things really

picked up.

MINI (V.O.)

My one rule which the agency wasn't

too happy about was, of course,

only firsts, no repeat customers.

MINI (V.O.)

But believe me, they didn't have

too much trouble honoring that

request.

(CONTINUED)

21.

MINI (V.O.)

I'd make house calls to offices at

lunch hour and we'd say I was

someone's niece or cousin in town

on vacation.

XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS - NIGHT

MINI (V.O.)

And then when football season

started, Saturday through Monday...

MINI (V.O.)

I was busier than Domino's.

MINI (V.O.)

Then one Thursday night I get a a

last minute gig at a fuck pad in

Westwood that some executive keeps

so "wifey" doesn't find the motel

bills on the gold card statements.

They say I'm just his type...young.

MINI (V.O.)

They tell me he's not big on the

chit-chat and he loves paying extra

for the stuff we charge extra for.

(CONTINUED)

22.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

It's open.

MARTIN

Hello?

MINI (V.O.)

Can you fucking believe it?

MINI

Uh...hi,

(quickly adopting a

southern accent)

Sorry, I'm Mlate.

ARTIN

Don't worry about it.

MINI

Mind if I freshen up?

MARTIN

Sure.

MINI (V.O.)

My own dad! My first thought was

"how sick is he?" But then I

started thinking...I'm one to talk,

and...well...

(CONTINUED)

23.

MINI (V.O.)

Why not? I mean, he isn't my real

dad...and talk about a first. The

more I thought about it...

MINI (V.O.)

...the more turned on I got. Then I

thought that if my mother could do

some strange guy in my bed, I could

do her strange guy in this bed.

MARTIN (O.S.)

Everything alright in there?

MINI

(still in her southern

accent)

Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would

you mind turning the lights off,

I'm kinda new to all this and a

little shy.

MARTIN (O.S.)

No, that's fine, but can we get

this show on the road?

MINI

Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's

tail.

M

INI

What did you have in mind tonight?

(CONTINUED)

24.

MARTIN

The deluxe.

MINI

Oh, so you want complete access?

MARTIN

(voice quivering)

Y...yes.

MINI

You do know that's extra?

MINI

Just so we're clear...Now, close

your eyes.

MINI

Come on.

MINI

Now just keep them shut for a

while.

FADE OUT:

MINI (V.O.)

I can't believe I pulled that off.

Keeping my face hidden actually

wasn't that hard, and he pretty

much let me do whatever I wanted.

25.

MINI (V.O.)

And you know what?...He was damn

good. I don't why Mom is throwing

the cat all over town, when she can

have this every night.

MARTIN

I...

(searching)

that was...you were really good.

MINI

(southern accent)

Thanks, Sugar.

MARTIN

I'd like to see you again,

but...uh...I never got your name?

MINI

Ginger.

MARTIN

Ginger, I won't forget.

M

MINI (V.O.)

I literally couldn't feel the

ground under my feet. A first to

top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him

one day, but I wanted to savor it

for a while.

(CONTINUED)

26.

MARTIN (O.S.)

Ginger! You forgot your...

MARTIN

...Jacket.

MINI (V.O.)

Here's to immediate gratification.

MINI

(whispering)

You were great.

MINI

Uh, that fall probably won't kill

you, and considering what a caring

nurturer your wife is, I don't

think that's a risk you can afford

to take.

MINI (V.O.)

God, what a drama queen. Don't let

this little act fool you. He'd

never let mom get all his money.

(CONTINUED)

27.

MINI (V.O.)

This is just his twisted public

relations brain working overtime to

figure what the appropriate

response should be to fucking your

stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate

suicide!

artin backs away from the railing.

MINI (V.O.)

Now that's thinking outside the

box.

MINI (V.O.)

We spent the next few hours just

sitting there. I don't think we

said three words. I think he was

trying to find a way to justify the

whole thing, but it was actually

one of the sweetest nights I ever

spent with a guy.

MINI (V.O.)

He told me it was a monumental

mistake and that we should both

never mention it again. I told him

that was fine.

MINI (V.O.)

Suddenly, he started coming home

every night and even started really

asking me about my homework.

MARTIN

Morning, Kiddo, you finish those

math problems?

(CONTINUED)

28.

MINI (V.O.)

Kiddo?

MARTIN

I'd be happy to help you with it,

if you need.

MINI

Actually, I'm thinking about

starting a 401K plan at work, could

you help me pick a good mutual

fund?

NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MINI (V.O.)

It took exactly one week.

MINI (V.O.)

In the beginning, I was concerned

this would violate my rule as he

technically was a repeat customer,

but then I realized this was my

first affair, and with my

stepfather no less. To be perfectly

honest...I loved it. Talk about

electric, knowing at any moment she

could walk in was better than any

drug. It reminded me of when I was

young and brought guys home after

school.

29.

MINI (V.O.)

At first, we were very discreet,

only doing it when Joan Crawford

wasn't home or was completely

comatose.

MINI (V.O.)

Then we got bolder, doing it before

she would pass out. I think we were

seeing exactly how far we could

push the envelope.

MINI (V.O.)

One night we did it before

"Entertainment Tonight" ended.

DISSOLVE TO:

MINI (V.O.)

We even almost got caught.

DIANE (O.S.)

Mini?

MINI

(startled)

Yeah?

(CONTINUED)

30.

MINI

God, I've told you a thousand times

to knock.

DIANE

Have you seen Martin? I think he

was in his study a half hour ago.

MINI

Uh...can't say that I have.

DIANE

Well, I assume he's gone out, so

I've invited Ricardo over for

a...cocktail. You know how children

make him uneasy, so I'd appreciate

if you and...

(pointing to Martin under

the sheet)

...your friend could either stay in

here or use the back door when he

arrives.

MINI

Oh...sure, no problem.

MINI

Okay, she's gone.

MINI (V.O.)

Looking back, that may have been

the moment we fell in love.

31.

MINI (V.O.)

We became inseparable.

MINI (V.O.)

Mom thought it was cute how we had

suddenly grown so close, and

thought it was wonderful how Martin

had taken an interest in my

education.

MINI (V.O.)

Now that we were spending time

together, I actually started to

find out what Martin was like for

the first time.

MINI (V.O.)

He wasn't the drip I thought he

was.

(CONTINUED)

32.

MINI (V.O.)

He was funny, charming, sweet and

even a little shy.

MINI (V.O.)

Being seen in public was no sweat,

as long as we didn't act like a

couple.

M

MINI (V.O.)

This went on for two months, before

we had the talk we both knew was

coming.

MARTIN

So...

MINI

So.

MARTIN

I don't want to have to sneak

around in my own house.

MINI

Well, I don't think telling her is

such a hot idea.

(CONTINUED)

33.

MARTIN

I mean, I don't want to live under

the same roof with her.

CLOSE ON:

MINI

You can't leave, she'll get half.

MINI

Can I ask how the hell you married

her without a pre-nup? Her?

MARTIN

(sighing)

She wasn't as bad an actress as you

think.

MINI

Well, there is another option.

MARTIN

There is?

MINI

But it will take some planning...

and some resolve.

MARTIN

Wait, you don't mean-

MINI

Kill her?

MINI

No, of course not, she is my

mother.

MARTIN

Good...

(CONTINUED)

34.

MINI

But I've been thinking, if she

suddenly got ill-

MARTIN

Ill?

MINI

Unstable, unpredictable,

irrational...dangerous to the

safety of her husband...her

child...She would have to be sent

someplace where they could give her

the care she needs.

ARTIN

It would be for her own good.

MINI

The only truly caring action we

could take.

MARTIN

As painful as it would be for me to

be without my loving wife.

MINI

You did it for the well being of

your daughter. The selfless act of

a devoted parent.

MARTIN

Of course, we'll have to make sure

her episodes are well documented.

MINI

And corroborated by friends and

people outside the family.

MARTIN

A public complaint by a neighbor

wouldn't hurt.

(CONTINUED)

35.

MINI

No, that would be useful.

MARTIN

And we'll find her a very

comfortable place out in the

country.

MINI

With lots of fresh air.

MARTIN

It will be a much better life for

her.

MINI

Much.

MINI (V.O.)

I awoke the next morning, as

excited as I could remember. Unlike

most firsts which are over too

quickly, this would take

determination...

MINI (V.O.)

Stamina...

(CONTINUED)

36.

MINI (V.O.)

And imagination.

M

MINI (V.O.)

I decided to start simply.

DIANE

Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

MINI (V.O.)

Part one, violent mood swings-

slash-uncontrollable rages.

DIANE

Fucking shit! Where are they?

DIANE

I'm gonna be late! It took me three

weeks to get an appointment with

Anton...

MINI (V.O.)

Anton Michelle, masseuse to the

stars and reported possessor of one

of the biggest schlongs in town.

Rumor has it, he's pouring the pork

to every rich wife between Malibu

and Pasadena. He must be incredible

if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass

out of bed this early.

DIANE

...and now I'm gonna miss it

because I can't find my fucking car

keys?!

DIANE

I could use a little help in here!

(CONTINUED)

37.

MARTIN

Coming, honey.

MARTIN

Diane, sugar, do you remember where

you put them when you came home

last night?

DIANE

Yeah, in the fucking bowl by the

fucking door where I always

fucking put them!

MINI

Well, uh, you were kinda out of it

last night.

DIANE

No, I wasn't! I had one drink with

Marie, one!

MARTIN

Uh, are you sure? You did seem a

bit tipsy.

DIANE

Yes, I'm sure, you dickless wonder.

iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a desk near the

MINI

(under her breath)

Now don't you listen to her, you

are not a dickless wonder.

DIANE

Mini, I'm taking your car. Martin,

take her to school.

(CONTINUED)

38.

MARTIN

Diane, I have a meeting with

Chapman, he's our biggest client--

DIANE

(opening the door)

Tell him it's an emergency.

MINI (V.O.)

Now, here comes the really fun

part. I realized a year ago that by

lowering my voice a bit I could do

a passable job imitating...

MINI

(mimicking Diane)

Hello, Anton? It's Diane Tannen, I

know it's late notice, but I'm

going to have to cancel our

appointment. What? No, of course, I

realize I'll still have to

pay...yes, something came up.

DIANE

Anton? But...Jeanette?

JEANETTE

Uh...hi, Diane?

ANTON

(french accent)

But, Mrs. Tannen, you call and

cancel zee session thirty meenutes

ago?       D

IANE

What? No, I didn't!

(CONTINUED)

39.

ANTON

Yes, I spoke to you myself, you say

sometheeng come up.

DIANE

Jeanette, you knew I had an

appointment today, did you pretend-

JEANETTE

(flustered)

No, I, I ...Anton called me and

told me he had a cancellation.

ANTON

Yes, I call her after you call me.

DIANE

Why, you sneaky little bitch!

MINI (V.O.)

Needless to say, word of the

L'incident de Anton spread quickly

through the community.

MINI

Do you think she'll press charges?

DIANE

Are you kidding? She should get

twenty to life! When I told Margo

and Penny about her little stunt,

they both said they'd have ripped

her eyes out. She'll be lucky if

anyone speaks to her again.

(CONTINUED)

40.

MARTIN

Here comes the choo-choo.

DIANE

For god's sake, I didn't break both

hands.

MINI

Jeez, I still can't believe you

broke your hand on her face? It's

so Linda Hamilton.

DIANE

(slugging some wine)

I hope she enjoys shitting out the

teeth she swallowed.

CARLOS

R

osa Angelica, this is Carlos.

CARLOS

Ah, si, Senora Tannen, como esta?

MINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.)

(annoyed)

Uh, Carlos...english, comprende?

CARLOS

(taken aback)

Okay.

MINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.)

I'm going to need a delivery to the

house.

(CONTINUED)

41.

MINI (V.O.)

Phase two: wild shopping sprees

carried out in a euphoric state.

MINI

Gosh, look at all the pretty

flowers.

CARLOS

Your mother said you are having a

big party!

MINI

(innocently)

I know, can you believe all this?

DIANE

Carlos, what the hell is going on?

CARLOS

Senora Tannen, the delivery you

ordered yesterday for the party?

DIANE

Ordered, I didn't order anything?!

Who told you to bring these here?

CARLOS

(flustered)

But, but, Senora, you did, you

called me, I talked to you.

DIANE

No, you didn't!

CARLOS

Si, you said you were having a

party, don't you remember?

You were very excited, saying you

were going to have the most

wonderful party and invite everyone

you knew and it had to be just

perfect. Perfect, that's what you

said.     M

INI

Mom, is that what you were talking

about yesterday?

DIANE

What?!

MINI

Well, it was after lunch and you

had washed your pain killers down

with some wine. You mumbled

something about a party before you

took a nap.

DIANE

No, I did not!

MINI

(wincing)

Mom, you did. The doctor said no

more mixing pain killers and

alcohol.

DIANE

But, but...I only slept for--

MINI

What is going on?! Carlos, what the

Oooh, now I see why he makes the

big bucks.

Uh, Martin, I, I...

Diane, did you order all this?!

Mom, go inside, just go, I'll

It's under control, Dad. Please,

let's not make a scene.

MONTAGE:

MINI (V.O.)

Over the next few days, whenever

Mom had passed out from too much

drinky-drinky...

MINI (V.O.)

I'd pull out her wallet...

...and reach out and touch someone.

MINI (V.O.)

It's really remarkable what you can

order with a Platinum card these

days.

MINI (V.O.)

Talk about easy. After a week of my

version of the home shopping

network, the doorbell might as well

have been a canon.

MINI (V.O.)

At this point, dear old mummy was

so spooked, I was actually afraid

she might stop drinking. So I

needed a back up plan, to keep

her...off-balance.

Of course, Mini.

Kraut lush named Helga Hauptfuhrer,

or "der Fuhrer" as she was

affectionately known, starts

jonesing for her afternoon nip...

Thank god for the quack who

invented ADD and the lazy parents

willing to let "Der Fuhrer" keep

their kids comfortably numb on what

basically amounts to legalized

speed.

MINI (V.O.)

My fears of mom giving up the sauce

were unfounded. Actually, she

started drinking more.

MINI (V.O.)

Which gave me the perfect

opportunity to prescribe her a

little pick-me-up.

DIANE

Mini! I asked you for that drink

ten minutes ago!

Put it on the counter.

You're welcome.

Mmm...this is really good. What's

in it, Sweetie?

MINI (V.O.)

The first time in my life she calls

me "sweetie" and I've just slipped

her the mother of all Mickeys.

MINI

Oh, this and that.

DIANE

My god, let me tell you, breaking

my hand on that bitch's face...

DIANE

...was the best thing that ever

happened to me.

MINI (V.O.)

Phase three: rambling incoherent

monologues in public.

DIANE

I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I

mean, I feel like I could run a

marathon like that Bruce Jenner

tell you before he had that face

javelin in me any day.

I want to talk to you about juries,

will you come and talk to me about

juries?

HUSBAND #1

Uh...

DIANE

I'd like to be on a jury and say

"guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do

you think goes on in all the

sequestered situations? Do you

think any of the jurors have sex

with each other? I was once on an

episode of Love Boat, playing the

role of "Bikini Girl" and my line

was "I'll have another," it was

with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had

to suck one of the associate

producers off to get the line, but

it got me my SAG card, so I guess

it was worth it.

HUSBAND #2

Uh, I think I could use a refill.

juries and Isaac and, and that drag

queen I broke my face on and..

What?

MINI

MacLean Stevenson played "Larry."

DIANE

Right, that's what I said...and

then MacKenzie Phillips tried to

slip me the tongue!

Listen, great job, but you need to

give me more warning. I was at

dinner with Chapman, and it's the

second time I've had to re-

schedule.

I'm sorry, but it was a golden

opportunity. You always said you

can't pay enough for good

publicity.

You didn't answer the question.

This isn't funny. I'm hanging up.

Hang up and you're dead.

I picked that prescription up three

days ago. It was probably more than

half full.

I suppose we should call an

ambulance?

MARTIN

Her pulse is almost gone.

MINI

Do you really think they can save

her?

MARTIN

I...I don't know.

She'll only try it again. You know

she will.

She will if we keep this torture

up.

MARTIN

(suddenly with resolve)

This is wrong, call an ambulance.

Hold on, who are we to say her

choice was wrong? She put those

pills in her mouth.

MARTIN

Mini--

MINI

Don't "Mini" me, you've been

bankrolling my little project from

day one.

MARTIN

We both agreed murder was out.

MINI

I'd hardly call it murder, if

anything, we're just helping to

fulfill her last wish.

MARTIN

She wouldn't have taken the pills

if we hadn't-

(urgently)

Mini, for gods sake, she still has

a pulse.

MINI

So do people in comas. It's just a

matter of time-

Mini, we-

Look, you can drop the indignant

outrage, because if you really

cared, you'd have already grabbed

the phone and dialed 911 by now.

Can't we just admit how lucky we

are? It's the perfect alibi, she

put the drugs in her system.

What? Just leave her here?

Exactly.

I don't know.

Can you think of one person she

this point? This is just the

natural, sad and inevitable

conclusion to a tragic life.

We're this close from being

And so we passed the time watching

my favorite show.

CLOSE ON THE TV:

Welcome to "Absolutely Positive!"

The show where we give couples

about to get married a last chance

to make sure they're...

STUDIO AUDIENCE

Absolutely Positive!

That's right! We send them out on

one last date with someone other

than their fiance, so they can be

sure they're really ready to make

that lifelong commitment.

MINI (V.O.)

Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the

scumbag at my birthday, produces it

and it's so twisted, I'm surprised

I didn't think of it.

MINI (V.O.)

Take happy couples about to marry

and try to break them up. The catch

is the couples are always sent on

dates with people just a little

better looking than their fiances.

MINI (V.O.)

And we waited some more.

Typical mom, she managed to fuck up

Finally, it was time to do the only

humane thing.

MINI

Come on, let's go.

MARTIN

What?

MINI

It's time to speed this up.

MARTIN

Speed this up?

MINI

We can't wait anymore, our alibi is

only believable for maybe another

hour. We can say that after dinner

we went to a movie, but if she

hasn't croaked by midnight, you can

forget about this.

MARTIN

No, I'm sorry, this is going

somewhere I'm not prepared to go.

MINI

Oh, but you were prepared to sit

here until the pills did her in? I

hate to break it to you, but

wherever you "weren't prepared to

go"...the hypocrite express just

rolled into the station.

MARTIN

What are you suggesting?

MINI

Well, I thought we'd disembowel her

and leave her for the raccoons.

MINI

Kidding...God, you've lost your

sense of humor. Don't worry, it'll

be painless.

(CONTINUED)

65.

MINI (V.O.)

To be honest, I think we both knew

in our hearts it would come to

this. And as my first assisted

suicide, I was going to make it

flawless. M

ARTIN

Come on, we don't have time.

MINI

Look, if we're going to screw up

the details we might as well call

San Quentin and tell them to fire

up the dutch oven.

(off his confusion)

The gas chamber?

(exasperated)

Martin, please, I can't explain

everything.

CUT TO:

MARTIN

I don't think this is a good idea.

MINI

Have you lost your mind, "Mr.

Public Relations"? What's the one

thing all her friends are going to

be talking about when they find

out?

(waits for his answer)

"How did she look"? Do you think

anyone will think twice if the

answer is "fabulous"?

66.

MINI

Well, if you've got anything to say

to her, now would be the time.

MARTIN

Could you just pretend to have a

little remorse?

XT. THE HOUSE - LATER.

Help us, please! My mom, I think

she's dead!

Mommy, wake up!

It's okay, sweetheart, everything's

going to be okay.

FIRST PARAMEDIC

Mr. Tannen, I think you should take

your daughter in the house.

MINI

Oh, please, don't let her die!

GARSON

Mr. Tannen?

MARTIN

Yes?

MAN

I'm Detective Bill Garson, LAPD.

MARTIN

Yes?

GARSON

I'm sorry to be here right now, but

whenever there's an apparent

suicide we are required to do an

investigation to rule out homicide.

MARTIN

(clearly surprised)

Oh...uh...right.

GARSON

It's really just a formality.

(CONTINUED)

68.

MINI

(exploding)

My mother just killed herself! They

haven't even taken her away yet!

What's wrong with you?

M

ARTIN

Mini, please! He's just doing his

job.

MINI

Tell him to leave! This is

outrageous!

MARTIN

(to Garson)

Could we do this another time?

GARSON

Of course we--

MARTIN

Thank you.

GARSON

But I do need to ask just a few

simple questions before I go.

MINI

Didn't you hear him?! He said--

MARTIN

(sharply)

Mini, it's okay...just go lie down

for a moment.

MARTIN

So after dinner and the movie, we

came home at around 11:30 and found

her in the garage. I turned off the

car and opened the garage door to

let out the exhaust.

(CONTINUED)

69.

GARSON

What about trying to revive your

wife?

MARTIN

Of course, we did that too, but I

couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a

course at school in CPR and tried

that, but...

(taking a breath)

it didn't work.

GARSON

So your wife did this sometime

between 8:00 and 11:33 when you

placed the 911 call?

MARTIN

Yes.

GARSON

May I ask why you left your wife

alone when she had been acting in

such an unstable state?

MARTIN

We never thought she'd do anything

like...this. After the episode in

the mall, Diane hadn't left the

house for three days and my

daughter and I just needed a break.

It's been a very stressful time.

GARSON

Of course. So this was your wife's

car?

MARTIN

Yes.

GARSON

Was it in the garage when you left

for dinner or did she drive it in?

MARTIN

What?

GARSON

Was it in the garage when you left?

(CONTINUED)

(a little flustered)

Is, is that important?

G

ARSON

Just trying to reconstruct what

happened.

MARTIN

Oh, well...after she was brought

home from the mall, the car was

towed here and we put it in the

garage.

GARSON

And no one drove it during those

three days?

MARTIN

No, Mini and I have our own cars.

GARSON

We are going to have to impound it

for a few days to take it to the

crime lab.

MARTIN

Crime lab? Oh, okay.

GARSON

Again, purely routine.

MARTIN

Sure.

GARSON

Have you found a note yet?

MARTIN

(confused)

I'm sorry?

GARSON

A suicide note? The deceased

usually leaves one.

MARTIN

Oh...right, no...not yet. But we

haven't really looked.

(CONTINUED)

71.

GARSON

Mind if I take a look around?

MARTIN

No...of course not.

MINI

Who cares if we didn't leave a

note? Just relax.

MARTIN

But they said it's--

MINI

So what? He'll do his little dance

and chalk it up to another failed

actress who realized after forty

she might as well be dead.

Oh, shit!

MINI

What?

MARTIN

The sweatsuits and goggles.

MINI

I already snuck out the back and

threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage

cans.

Good.

Angelpie, just relax, we did it,

we're free.

and went somewhere where we could

act like a real couple for the

first time.

Martin agreed and let me pick the

place. I chose Las Hadas in

Mexico, because that's where Dudley

Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten.

MINI (V.O.)

I figured sugar daddy/younger woman

would be old news down there.

MINI (V.O.)

I could feel that Martin had let

the whole thing with the cops go.

It had been two weeks since Mom's

death and it already felt like it

happened a year ago.

You know, I've been thinking that I

might enjoy working in your office

this summer.

RUDELL

Last week Mini mentioned you two

were coming here for a little R&R,

and I suddenly realized I hadn't

taken a vacation in god knows when.

Jennifer, this is my neighbor

MINI

I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we

met? You look so familiar.

JENNIFER

I don't think so.

(CONTINUED)

74.

MINI (V.O.)

And the icing is that Jennifer

works for the same escort service

that I did. Now this is rich.

MIKE

I wanted you both to know how sorry

I am for your loss.

MINI (V.O.)

Our loss? He just lost six or

seven freebies a year.

MIKE

If there's anything I can do...

(to Mini)

for either of you...

MINI (V.O.)

Yikes, now that Mom's out of the

way, I guess I'm fair game.

MIKE

...don't hesitate to ask. Remember

I'm just right across the fence.

MARTIN

(measured)

Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it.

MARTIN

Why did you tell him?!

MINI

I was just being friendly, I had no

idea he'd decide to come here.

MARTIN

He knows. He found the clothes and

goggles and he fucking knows!

MINI

I doubt he even knows where his

trash cans are.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

75.

You're overreacting. It's just

coincidence.

MARTIN

Yeah, well coincidence or not, he

saw us together.

MINI

It was dark, I sat up before he saw

anything. M

ARTIN

No, he knows. It was like he was

toying with us.

MINI

Just relax, what is he going to do?

Go home and tell everyone we're a

couple? We'll just laugh it off and

tell everyone he vacations with

hookers.

MINI

Oh, come on, could that little

moment between you and Jennifer

have been any more awkward?

MINI

I'm not jealous or anything, I just

think it's funny. Talk about six

degrees of penetration.

MARTIN

You realize he could blackmail us?

If the police found out about us,

that suicide wouldn't look so

routine.

MINI

Martin, please, calm down. Trust

me, nothing is going to happen.

We returned home and things didn't

get much better.

MONTAGE:

What little sex we were having    was

getting dull.

MINI (V.O.)

Quite frankly, with my little

project successfully completed...

I was bored. I became concerned

that in my world of firsts I had

achieved my greatest first...

...at too young an age.

"Happy birthday, Mr. President"

MINI (V.O.)

As for school, well, I was just in

no state to return to my studies

after the trauma of my mother's

death.

MINI (V.O.)

Uh oh.

MINI

Yes?

GARSON

Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I

don't know if you remember me?

MINI

Drogues, my last name is Drogues.

And "yes", I remember you, you were

the big hearted lug who wanted your

questions answered while my mother

was still warm.

GARSON

(ignoring her dig)

So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather?

(CONTINUED)

78.

MINI

Nice work, McGruff.

GARSON

Again, I am sorry about that night,

but it is policy that we get the

preliminary facts as soon as

possible.

MINI

What do you want?

GARSON

I need to ask you a few more

questions about your mother's

death.    M

INI

Sure, come on in.

MINI (V.O.)

I know, it's stupid as hell to talk

to a cop without a lawyer, but I

didn't want to look jumpy and my

first real interrogation? I could

feel something tingle deep inside.

GARSON

It's a little early for the prom,

isn't it?

MINI

A girl can dream, can't she?

GARSON

Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got

the preliminary coroner's report.

Although the pills knocked her out,

she died of the carbon monoxide

poisoning from the exhaust.

MINI

Is it that important?

(CONTINUED)

79.

GARSON

Well, it's just a little unusual

for a suicide victim to use two

methods. Her choices seemed, I

don't know how to put it...

improvisational.

MINI

Well, maybe she wanted to drift off

before the fumes got her? She

clearly put some thought into that

outfit.

GARSON

Clearly...But dying from carbon

monoxide poisoning is actually

pretty painless, you just basically

pass out.

MINI

I doubt she would have had an

intimate knowledge of how car fumes

feel when you choke on them.

GARSON

I suppose you're right...Also we

checked the phone records and there

was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It

was a hang up and when the 911

dispatcher called back a few

minutes later, there was no answer.

MINI

Really?

GARSON

Any idea why she'd call 911?

MINI (V.O.)

Okie fine, this may be the most

exciting thing I've done in a

while, but even I know when the

rush isn't worth the risk.

MINI

Look, I think you should come back

when my father's around. He'll be

upset I let a stranger in the

house.    G

I think you're safe with me.

MINI

Even so, he won't be happy.

GARSON

Not a problem, will he be home

tonight?

MARTIN

And you let him in?!

MINI

I played it cool, it would've

looked worse to be defensive.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Well, when's he coming over?

MINI

Tonight?

MARTIN (V.O.)

Tonight!? I've got a dinner with

Chapman. I've already cancelled--

Damn it! Why didn't you call me?!

MINI

(annoyed)

Hey, I didn't know you had plans!

(CONTINUED)

81.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Listen, I'll be home early so we

can get the story straight.

MINI

Okay.

GARSON

I really appreciate you taking the

time to help us out. There's just a

few loose ends we want to tie up.

MARTIN

Absolutely. What would you like to

know?

G

ARSON

There appears to be some question

as to the time of death. You said

you went to dinner and a movie-

MARTIN

Detective, not to be overly

sensitive, but do I need my lawyer

here? Because these sound like the

questions one asks when there's a

homicide investigation.

GARSON

Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just

finish this up, I've got real

homicides that need attention. How

about if I just ask you some

questions and the one's you don't

want to answer, we'll just skip?

MINI

That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad?

I mean, let's just get this over

with.

(CONTINUED)

82.

MARTIN

Fair enough.

GARSON

Terrific...now, the preliminary

blood report indicated she had

ritalin in her system.

MARTIN

I wasn't aware my wife was taking

ritalin.

GARSON

Neither was her physician, he had

never prescribed it.

MARTIN

Well, as you may have discovered by

now, my wife had substance abuse

problems, I'm sure there were many

drugs she took without a

prescription.

GARSON

I know, but it's an odd drug to be

taking. It's mostly given to adults

and children with Attention Deficit

Disorder to calm them. But in

people who don't need it, it has

the reverse effect, making them

incredibly hyper and agitated.

MARTIN

Again, Detective, I really can't

say why she was taking these drugs.

GARSON

Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you

and your wife close?

MARTIN

No...we led, for the most part,

separate lives. We had decided to

stay together for Mini.

(CONTINUED)

83.

MINI (V.O.)

O

oh...sacrifice personal happiness

for the benefit of the child.

Excellent.

GARSON

I see...

MARTIN

Listen, Detective Garson, I must

admit I don't see the relevance of

these questions. Diane was an

extremely disturbed person. Haven't

you interviewed enough people who

saw her at her worst?

GARSON

Yes, but what I'm still unclear

about is her time of death.

MARTIN

Well, that makes two of us...

Again, detective, we were out for

the whole evening.

GARSON

(looking at his notes)

After dinner you saw a movie that

night?

MARTIN

That's right.

MINI (V.O.)

Start time 9 o'clock.

GARSON

What did you see?

MARTIN

That new Jackie Chan movie where

the terrorists try to blow up Mount

Rushmore.

MINI (V.O.)

Running time 115 minutes.

GARSON

Ahh...My buddy told me the end is

crazy.

(CONTINUED)

84.

MINI (V.O.)

For god sakes, does he think we

wouldn't actually see it?

MARTIN

Yeah, he slides down Washington's

nose with the bomb strapped to him.

MINI

Dad...Don't give it away, he hasn't

seen it yet.

MARTIN

Another demerit...

GARSON

That's okay...Where did you see it?

MARTIN

The Galleria.

MINI (V.O.)

Drive time 17 minutes.

GARSON

And you got home at?

MINI (V.O.)

Precisely...

MARTIN

11:30.

MINI (V.O.)

With 12 minutes of previews. You

didn't think we'd forget the

previews?

MARTIN

Now, if there aren't any more

questions, it is a school night.

GARSON

No, that about wraps it up for now.

(CONTINUED)

85.

MARTIN

For now? Detective we are trying

very hard to put our lives back

together, but every time you come

by, it just dredges everything back

up. We've told you everything we

know.     G

ARSON

I wish I could be more definitive.

MARTIN

Well, I'm telling you the next time

you have a question, it had better

be because you're charging us-

GARSON

Us?

MARTIN

I'm just asking you to please let

us deal with our grief and get on

with our lives.

GARSON

(standing)

Thanks again for your time.

MARTIN

What the hell was I thinking,

letting you talk me into this?

MINI

It's probably just routine stuff.

MARTIN

That was not routine, my dear.

MINI

Nice use of the word "us", by the

way.

MARTIN

Sorry, it just slipped out.

(CONTINUED)

86.

MINI

If I had a nickel for every time I

heard that-

MARTIN

(sharply)

Okay.

MINI

Look, just chill, I'm sure this

will blow over in a few days.

MARTIN

Chill?! Believe me, we'll be

chilling in a pine box if he

figures everything out. You do

understand they could go for the

death penalty?

MINI

He's probably just trying to spook

us.

MARTIN

Hello?! They don't try and spook

you unless they think you did it!

MINI

It was a great plan, no one can

prove we stuck those sleeping pills

in her mouth, because we didn't.

MARTIN

(seething)

Well, if it was such a great plan,

why am I cancelling business

dinners to accommodate a detective

who appears convinced it wasn't a

suicide?

MINI

I'll see you later.

MARTIN

Where are you going?

MINI

Out.

87.

M

MINI (V.O.)

Would he follow?

MINI (V.O.)

Was there any question?

MARTIN

A phone call would have been

appreciated at some point. I was

worried.

MINI (V.O.)

Worried that refugee from a J.Lo

video rode me `til the tires fell

off?

(CONTINUED)

88.

MINI

Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're

aware, but at this point you can't

be my dad and my lover. Where I go

and how late I stay out is my

business.

MARTIN

I wasn't saying that as a dad.

(very sincere)

Before your mother and I...grew

apart, I would worry if she was out

late.

MINI

Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her

and I can assure you I won't end up

passed out in some greaseball's

fuck pad with my panties around my

ankles...

(cold, smooth)

u

nless I choose to.

MARTIN

What the hell's gotten into you? I

just expressed concern for you and

you turn around and threaten me?

Mini, in a relationship, it's okay

to worry about someone else.

MINI (V.O.)

I kind of have to admire this. He

really is one of the world's

premiere bullshit artists.

MARTIN

Haven't you ever been in a

relationship?

MARTIN

My god, you haven't.

MINI

Congratulations...

(sniffling)

you're my first.

(CONTINUED)

89.

MARTIN

Oh, angel.

MINI (V.O.)

And I'd like to thank the academy

and god and, oh yeah, "Free Tibet".

MINI (V.O.)

Fake tears aside...he actually was

my first relationship. Which, in

itself, was significant, because I

had always felt that by living my

life by the rule of firsts, I would

never be able to find someone who

could accept me on those terms.

MINI (V.O.)

And I was willing to give him the

chance to be that person...

MINI (V.O.)

...if he could just hold it

together.

MARTIN

Morning, Lois.

LOIS

Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for

you.

(CONTINUED)

90.

MINI (V.O.)

That's when things started to get

interesting.

MARTIN

Lois, I need you to re-schedule the

Chapman meeting...

(listening)

I know...Tell him...tell him it's

an unavoidable emergency.

MARTIN

What do you mean you don't keep

records on who your senders are?

CLERK

When it's paid cash, we only keep

records on packages, not envelopes.

MARTIN

Yeah?

LOIS (O.S.)

Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr.

Chapman...he told me to tell you

that he's going to be seeking a new

firm to handle his company's needs.

(CONTINUED)

91.

MARTIN

Thank you, Lois.

MARTIN

Steve? Charlie? What, what are

you doing in town? Why didn't you

tell me you were coming--

M

ATHER

We just heard about Chapman...not

that it matters.

BOYD

We can't afford to lose any more

clients.

MARTIN

Jesus, guys, my wife just committed

suicide...

MATHER

No one's saying this isn't a

difficult time for you, but

whatever's been distracting you

started long before that.

BOYD

There's just no way to sugarcoat

this...you're a liability we can't

afford anymore...

MARTIN

Fifteen years...we've been--

(CONTINUED)

92.

MATHER

(curtly)

We'll be asking all our clients who

they would prefer to stay with, and

of course, you'll have an equal

shot to make your case with them.

MARTIN

Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking

shit!

MARTIN (O.S.)

Look at that smug prick...He's

fucking with me and I will not be

fucked with.

MINI

What are you gonna do?

M

ARTIN

I'm gonna go over there and tell

him to back off or he's gonna get

hurt.

(CONTINUED)

93.

MINI

Are you crazy? We're not even

positive it's him!

MARTIN

My god, the picture was dropped off

at a messenger service right across

the street from his office! He was

the only person at the resort who

knew who we were!

MINI

He could go to the cops and tell

them you threatened him, then

they'd really start investigating

us. It's just one photo and you

can't even really tell if it's me.

MARTIN

That son of bitch just cost me the

firm I worked fifteen years to

build.

MINI

Well, if you start waving that

thing around, he's gonna cost you a

lot more than that.

MINI (V.O.)

Martin didn't sleep at all that

night and made damn well sure I

didn't either.

MINI (V.O.)

With Mommy Dearest out of the way,

I decided to take the matter of

Rudell into my own hands. I knew

Martin wouldn't approve, but at

this point...action had to be

taken.

(CONTINUED)

94.

MINI (V.O.)

I would catch him off guard,

disorient him and then kill him...

MINI (V.O.)

...with kindness.

MINI

Hi, Mr. Rudell, I'm sorry to bother

you.

RUDELL

Not at all, as I said down in

Mexico...

(slightly lascivious)

anything for a neighbor.

MINI

May I come in?

M

INI

Wow, I haven't been here since you

redecorated.

RUDELL

It was just finished. I'm sorry

your mother never got to see it

completed.

MINI

I know she'd approve.

RUDELL

If you don't mind me asking, ...how

are you doing?

MINI

It's been hard, but I guess I've

just been telling myself that she's

probably much happier where she is

now.

RUDELL

You're absolutely-

(CONTINUED)

95.

MINI

Positive!?

RUDELL

(chuckling)

Well, that too, but "correct" was

the word I was thinking of. Do you

like the show?

MINI

Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love

how you never know if the couples

will decide to stay together.

RUDELL

I could arrange for you to go to

the set one day if you'd like, or

even be a contestant?

MINI

A contestant? Really?

RUDELL

Sure, those dates are really quite

harmless. You just spend an evening

with the person. We prep you on

what to say before the show.

MINI

It sounds like fun.

RUDELL

Anyway, what's on your mind?

MINI

Well, um...this may sound strange,

but you haven't seen any suspicious

looking people around our house

lately?

RUDELL

No, is everything okay?

MINI

Yes, it's just that since mom's

death, someone sent us a photo of

Martin and I together.

(CONTINUED)

96.

RUDELL

Together?

MINI

It indicated that we were...I know

this sounds crazy, but...a couple.

RUDELL

A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm...I

mean, certainly older men and

younger women are an

(searching again)

...accepted part of society, but

for someone to do that, well...it's

just tasteless.

MINI

Exactly, so we're just trying to

figure who Rit could be.

UDELL

Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at

all...Out of curiosity, what kind

of a picture could they send you to

indicate that you and Martin were

together?

MINI

Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or

anything. I mean, of course, he's

seen me naked, he is my step-

father.

RUDELL

Of course.

MINI (V.O.)

Much to my surprise, I was invited

to stay for a refreshing

beverage...

(CONTINUED)

97.

MINI (V.O.)

I knew he had had no shortage of

young women in his bed, but he had

been paying for it in one form or

another for a long time.

MINI (V.O.)

And the one undeniable fact I had

learned from Martin is that there

is no greater thrill or triumph in

a man's life...

MINI (V.O.)

...than getting a ripe young woman

to open the gates to heaven for no

other reason than she wanted to.

MINI (V.O.)

Frankly, I'm surprised the

anticipation of pulling off a

mother-daughter double dip didn't

give him a stroke right there.

XT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE - LATER.

MINI

"Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a

dream, separate the sorrow and

collect up all the cream, the candy

man, oh, the candy man can"

(CONTINUED)

98.

MINI (V.O.)

I left that day, exhilarated in the

knowledge that in one afternoon, I

had turned Rudell into a trout on a

line...and he'd follow me anywhere

I tugged the pole.

MINI

(singing)

"The candy man can 'cause he mixes

it with love and makes the world

taste good..."

MINI (V.O.)

The photos stopped coming and

although Martin was freaking out

about his business, things were

returning to normal. I even decided

to return to school.

BISHOP

Mini, I've got a message for you to

go to the principal's office right

away.

MINI (V.O.)

Then things got interesting again.

(CONTINUED)

99.

MINI

Detective Garson, is everything all

right?

black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's

GARSON (O.S.)

Mini, this tape was shot a week

before your mother's death.

GARSON (O.S.)

The next day, the school nurse

reported two bottles of Ritalin

missing from the medicine cabinet.

GARSON

We've lifted two prints from the

door and the inside of the medicine

cabinet. They don't match the

nurse.

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Mini, is there something you'd like

to say to Detective Garson?

MINI

Can we see the tape of the Der

Fuhrer sucking down her afternoon

fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have

cameras in the bathroom stalls?

(CONTINUED)

100.

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Young lady, stealing anything,

especially prescription drugs is a

serious matter.

MINI

You got me, okay?   But what was I

supposed to do?

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

What do you mean?

MINI

(suddenly hysterical)

She...She said if I didn't, she

was...was gonna--

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Who?   Another student?

MINI

My mother! She made me steal them

for her! I didn't want to, but she

said she was going to send me to

boarding school in Canada if I

didn't!   P

RINCIPAL ANDREWS

Canada?

MINI

(sobbing)

The Yukon territories! Are you

happy, now? You got me!

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Oh my lord, I had know idea, she

was--

MINI

An addict? Detective Garson knew!

We told him, and now what? The

whole school's gonna know!?

MINI

She's dead, my mommy's dead. Can't

we just leave her be?

(CONTINUED)

101.

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Detective Garson, I assume, there

won't be a need to press charges

against Ms. Drogues?

MINI

(sniffling)

You gonna cuff me, Copper!?

GARSON

She's free to go.

GARSON

Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming

up to see you. Have you got a

minute?

MARTIN

Detective, I told you no more

questions without my lawyer.

GARSON

I think you'd better call him.

GARSON

There's a small discrepancy that I

can't quite figure out and I was

hoping you might be able to explain

it.

MARTIN

I suppose I can try.

(CONTINUED)

102.

GARSON

The final toxicology report came

back and your wife definitely

didn't die from the pills. She

wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it

was the fumes that killed her.

M

ARTIN

Well, hallelujah, thanks for the

update-

VOLANT

Martin, easy.

MARTIN

I'm sorry, but this is harassment.

GARSON

See, here's what I needed to ask

you. The gas tank in the Jag was

almost full, just a gallon had been

used.

MARTIN

And?

GARSON

Well, if she was unconscious by

9:30, that means the car must have

been running for at least two hours

when you found her. An unconscious

person can't turn on a car, right?

VOLANT

Detective, with all due respect,

could you get to the point?

GARSON

Well, here's where I get confused,

see, that particular model idling

for two hours will burn at least

four gallons of gas.

GARSON

So, there's really no way the tank

could be almost full if it was

running for two hours. Is there?

(CONTINUED)

103.

GARSON

So, I guess what I'm asking is,

whose idea was it to put her in the

car?

VOLANT

Martin, don't say anything.

GARSON

Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had

the most to gain from her death,

but I've learned from a number of

your wife's friends that she and

Mini had a strained relationship.

VOLANT

Again, Detective, my client won't

be answering anything, so let's

just cut the cat and mouse.

GARSON

I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if

he's trying to be a protective

father by covering up something

Mini did, I'd be careful. The

district attorney is viewing this

case as an opportunity to show the

public that the rich don't get away

with murder in this town.

V

OLANT

Does this mean he's offering Mr.

Tannen immunity if he says he was

protecting his daughter?

GARSON

It's a strong possibility. But he

wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go

for the maximum sentence if he

doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea

bargains, nothing.

104.

MINI

It was Colonel Mustard in the

library with the candlestick.

PELHAM

(nervously)

Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-

MINI

Don't wet your pants, I know when

to shut up and swallow...

MINI

...my tongue.

GARSON

Look, the fact that the marriage

was unhappy and there was no pre-

nup gives all the motive to Martin.

MINI

So you want me to say it was his

idea?

GARSON

If it was his idea, give me one

reason you should take the fall?

MINI (V.O.)

At that moment I knew we had him.

If he was trying to get me to rat

on Martin, he didn't have enough to

charge either one of us.

(CONTINUED)

105.

MINI

So if I tell the jury it was his

idea and I was scared for my life,

because he said he'd kill me if I

ever told anyone, then I walk?

M

INI

Sorry, sport, but I'll take my

chances.

MARTIN

I never doubted for a minute you

were going to hold firm. Not a

second. I hope you know that?

MINI

Oh, I knew...I knew.

MARTIN

Good. You realize, we've got to

rely on each other?

MINI

Who else do we have?

MARTIN

Exactly. We're almost home free. My

lawyer says that gas gauge theory

is circumstantial as hell. I've

only got one concern now.

MINI

What?

MARTIN

Rudell. If a jury knew we were a

couple, we've both got a motive and

that changes everything.

(CONTINUED)

106.

MINI

Baby, don't worry about him, he's

just jealous 'cause you've still

got rockin' abs and a better

hairline.

MINI

Even if he did send that picture,

what does it prove?...Nothing.

MINI (V.O.)

For all of Martin's talk of relying

on each other...

MINI (V.O.)

Garson had succeeded in planting

the seeds of distrust.

MINI (V.O.)

Our relationship had turned into

what some might call...

MINI (V.O.)

...unhealthy.

M

MINI (V.O.)

Something had to give, and

ironically enough, it was the night

I was making my television debut.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

107.

I had asked Martin to be home by

eight for a big surprise.

MINI

Oh, hey, come and watch. You're

missing me, I'm on TV!

MARTIN

What? Why?

MINI

Hurry up, the commercial's almost

over!

HOST

Welcome back to Absolutely

Positive. Now it's time to hear how

the date between Jason and Mini

ended.

MARTIN

You? You went on-

MINI

Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now

shhh...

CLOSE ON THE

SCREEN:

HOST

Jason, you said that the reason you

wanted to come on the show was to

test your ability to resist

temptation.

(CONTINUED)

108.

JASON

(a bit nervous)

Well, since Becky and I have dated

since high school and decided to

remain virgins until marriage, I

just wanted to go on a date with

another girl just to see how I

would react. You know, whether

there'd be any feelings of doubt

about my decision?

HOST

So, after dinner, what happened?

JASON

Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go

to a dance club she knew. I'm not

really a good dancer, but I said

"yes."

BECKY

(hurt)

We never go dancing.

HOST

So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer?

M

INI

Well, he's a damn quick learner,

and not just at dancing.

MINI

Martin, for god's sake, that was

their line. You think I talk like

that?

CLOSE ON THE

SCREEN:

HOST

Oh, really? So there was some other

teacher-student stuff going on?

JASON

(uncomfortable)

Uh, no, not really-

(CONTINUED)

109.

MINI

Oh, come on, what about when we

went back to your place?

BECKY

You what?!

JASON

I, I don't know what she's talking

about.

MINI

Come on, don't be bashful. He put

on some soft music and-

JASON

No! This isn't true, why are you-

MINI

We started kissing and-

BECKY

Jason!

JASON

(to Mini)

Shut up!

STUDIO AUDIENCE

OOOOHHHHH!

MINI

But, Jay-Jay, it was really

special.

(to the host)

He loves to be called "Jay-Jay".

BECKY

You, you...

MINI

Let me tell you, Becky, you're in

for a wild ride from this Bronco.

STUDIO AUDIENCE

WHOOOOOOAAAA!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

110.

MARTIN

Did, did you...

BECKY (O.S.)

You slept with her?!

MINI

God, Martin, it was a one time

thing. He was a virgin, how could

I say "no"? Believe me, she'll

thank me after their wedding night.

MARTIN

You had me come home early to-

MINI

Don't be jealous. It won't happen

again. It was just a goof.

MARTIN

Rudell? He let you go on?

MINI

Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I

wasn't really supposed to, you

know, "go all the way" but-

MARTIN

I can't believe you...th-that

couple, you ruined their

relationship.

M

INI

Excuse me, but the show is called

Absolutely Positive for a reason.

Clearly, the only thing Jason was

positive about was-

MARTIN

You're a sick little twist, you

know that?

MINI

Well, what does that make you?

(CONTINUED)

111.

MARTIN

(heading outside)

I need some air.

MINI

Oh, by the way, some intern from

your office stopped by earlier

today with something. It's on the

desk.

MINI

What is it?

MINI

Oh, my god.

MARTIN

(very evenly)

I think it's time I had a little

chat with our neighbor

MINI

No, this is exactly what he wants!

What if he's working with Garson?

MARTIN

Then he can't blackmail me. Wait

here, I'll be right back.

MINI

No, please, don't do this! Let me

go with you!

MARTIN

I said wait here.

(CONTINUED)

112.

MINI

Don't do this, we can leave

tonight! We'll drive to Mexico!

MARTIN

He'll never leave us alone, you

realize that?

MINI

No! Let me talk to him, he promised

me he wouldn't hurt us!

MARTIN

He did? When?

MINI

A few days ago!

MARTIN

You saw him?

MINI

I went to try and find out what he

knew! I spent the afternoon with

him-      M

ARTIN

You...spen-

MINI

I was doing it for us! I figured he

wouldn't turn us in if I...

MARTIN

If you...?

MINI

If I made him think I was...

interested.

MARTIN

And was he?

MARTIN

Please tell me you didn't.

(CONTINUED)

113.

MINI

No...

MINI

I just made him think I would, so

he wouldn't turn us in.

MARTIN

(sarcastically)

Thank you, I appreciate your

restraint.

MINI

Fuck you. I'd think you'd be a

little more appreciative.

MARTIN

Who were you doing it for when you

did it with that kid? Huh? Who was

that selfless act for!?

MINI

Oh, like you're such a martyr for

being faithful? It shows amazing

restraint to limit yourself to just

one stepdaughter!

MARTIN

Don't lecture me about fidelity!

Your mother was cheating within six

months of the "I do's"!

MARTIN

Now, if you'll excuse me...

MINI

Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really

am, but this isn't the answer!

(CONTINUED)

114.

MINI

You're hurting me!

MARTIN

(through his teeth)

Calm down or I'll snap it in two,

do you hear me?

MARTIN

Now, I want you to wait here for

me. Do you understand?

MINI

(softly)

Please don't do this.

R

UDELL

Martin, what a surprise, how are

you?

MARTIN

Just watched Mini on your show.

RUDELL

Ahh...was tonight the night? We

taped that two weeks ago. Let me

tell you, I have girls audition all

the time for me and...

(enjoying this)

She was fucking incredible.

MARTIN

A natural, huh?

(CONTINUED)

115.

RUDELL

Like a duck to water...and totally

willing to take direction.

RUDELL

I wish all the girls I worked with

had her...how can I put this?...

Need to please.

MARTIN

You son of a bitch...

SINATRA (V.O.)

"Let's take it nice and easy..."

MINI

(frantic)

Yes, hello, you've got to send a

police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane

right away! My father's gone crazy,

I think he's going to hurt our

neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh

god, hurry!

SINATRA (V.O.)

"Hey, baby, what's your hurry?

Relax, don't you worry..."

(CONTINUED)

116.

MARTIN

Where are they?! Huh?

RUDELL

What are you talk-

MARTIN

Don't fuck with me! The negatives!

RUDELL

What?!

SINATRA (V.O.)

"The problem now of course is, to

simply hold your horses..."

SINATRA (V.O.)

"To rush would be a crime..."

MARTIN

You son of a bitch! How's that

feel?! You like that?! You thought

you could have my wife and my

daughter too?!

SINATRA (V.O.)

"`Cause nice and easy does it, nice

and easy does it..."

(CONTINUED)

117.

MARTIN

Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may

have taken pity on you between

vodkas, but not her! Not her!

M

ARTIN

Now tell me where they are or I

swear to god, I'll crack your head

open!

MINI (O.S.)

Martin, don't!

MARTIN

Go look for the negatives!

MINI

No! This is insane!

MARTIN

We need the negatives!

MINI

You're gonna kill him!

MARTIN

What are you doing! He'll tell

everyone!

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Freeze, police!

(CONTINUED)

118.

OFFICER

Drop the club and put your hands

up!

MINI

Thank God! Thank God, you came!

MARTIN

Mini, you called them?! How could

you call them?!

MINI

He's...he's crazy, I told him not

to! I told him to stop!

SINATRA (V.O.)

"Nice and easy does it...every

time."

FADE OUT:

MINI (V.O.)

Needless to say, my appearance on

Absolutely Positive was the most

sought after clip in every newsroom

in town.

MINI (V.O.)

The trial was quick. Once Mom's

affair with Rudell came out, the

D.A. realized he had a motive and a

slam dunk.

HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye

FOREWOMAN

Guilty.

(CONTINUED)

119.

MINI (V.O.)

Since, Rudell was in a coma, the

issue of my relationship with

Martin was moot. Martin realized

trying to pin anything on me would

probably get him the chair.

MINI (V.O.)

At his sentencing I begged for

leniency. He got off with ten for

the attempted murder of Rudell and

twenty to life for mom's death.

MINI (V.O.)

The outpouring of support was

amazing.

MINI (V.O.)

Martin's assets were put in a trust

for me and since I was eighteen, I

was allowed to live by myself.

120.

MINI

I'm sorry I forgot to bring that

book you wanted.

MARTIN

It's okay, Myou can mail it.

INI

Are you okay? You look like you

haven't showered in days.

MARTIN

(disturbed)

Well...uh...you have to be careful

about sh-...So how's school?

MINI

(excited)

You'll never guess what happened.

MARTIN

What?

MINI

I was voted valedictorian!

MARTIN

But don't you have to be-

MINI

The best student? I know! But the

students took a vote and they said

they wanted me to have it for

demonstrating remarkable courage in

the face of unspeakable loss.

MARTIN

(smiling sadly)

I wonder how the real valedictorian

feels?

MINI

Like slitting his wrists with the

sharp end of a protractor.

(CONTINUED)

121.

MARTIN

Is Rudell out of his coma yet?

MINI

I don't know, why?

MARTIN

Why?

(taken aback)

Mini, if he recovers, he may try to

blackmail you with those pictures.

MINI

(nonchalant)

Oh...I wouldn't worry about that.

MARTIN

But if the D.A. got those pictures,

you could-

MINI

I'm pretty sure he won't be doing

anything with them.

MARTIN

Mini, you're not thinking of

sleeping with him to keep him

quiet? Because I've met people in

here who could help us with him, if

it comes to that.

MINI

Help us?

MARTIN

They know people on the outside we

could...pay to make sure he doesn't

try to take advantage of you.

MINI

Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's

like you're a real life criminal

with connections and everything,

but I'm a little surprised you

haven't figured it out yet.

MARTIN

What?

(CONTINUED)

122.

MINI

Oh...wow, like I thought you were

just playing along `cause I'm your

only link to the outside world, but

you really don't know?

M

INI

Rudell didn't send those pictures.

MINI

You remember, Aurelio?

MARTIN

Our cabana boy from Mexico?

MINI

What a sweetie, I thought I might

have to fuck him, but just giving

him the camera was enough.

MARTIN

You...you...

MINI

It was pretty clear Garson wasn't

gonna give up, and sooner or later

he'd find enough to charge us. It

just seemed ridiculous that we'd

both end up suffering.

MINI

Oh, come on, you would've done it

if you thought of it first...you

know I'm right.

(CONTINUED)

123.

MINI

(suddenly switching gears)

Hey, listen, since conjugal visits

are pretty much out of the

question, I thought it would be

cool if we tried a little prison

phone sex.

MINI

They don't tap these lines, do

they?

(looking around)

I think I might even be able to

open my blouse without anyone

seeing...you ready?

MARTIN

Guard!

MINI

No? Are you sure? I won't be able

to come back for a few weeks.

(mock jealous)

Wait, have you met someone in

here?!

MARTIN

Guard!

MINI

Why, you old dog! I knew you

wouldn't be single in here for

long.

MARTIN

Guard! She did it! She just

admitted it! It was her idea!

MINI

I guess this means I could start

dating around too?

MARTIN

Don't let her leave! She's guilty!

Get the warden!

G

UARD

Okay, that's enough!

(CONTINUED)

124.

MARTIN

You bitch! You little whore!

MINI

(starting to cry)

Daddy, why are you saying those

things!

MARTIN

I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me,

you little bitch!

MINI

(sobbing)

Daddy, stop! I love you! Don't say

that! I love you!

MINI (V.O.)

...As many of you know, the past

few months of my life have been

very difficult. I don't know how I

would have gotten through it

without all of you. I really think

it is a testament to the love in

this institution, that I stand

before you today, as the first

straight "C" student in school

history voted Valedictorian.

MINI (CONT'D)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

125.

Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the

real valedictorian, he deserved

this and I want to wish him a

speedy recovery. I spoke to his

doctors today and they say, with

medication and therapy, Marvin

should be able to attend Harvard

this fall.

MINI

While I may not have excelled in

the classroom, I think my recent

experiences in that bigger

schoolhouse we call "life", have

taught me a few lessons that I'd

like to share with my fellow

graduates.

MINI

Follow your heart and don't

question it, now matter where it

tells you to go. Trust me, it'll

open up a world of new experiences

you can't even imagine.

MINI

But as you listen to it, don't

forget your family, your parents.

Don't forget they're people too,

and while we may not always agree

with them, remember to love them

when they need love.

MINI

(voice breaking)

And I mean really love them, don't

just pay them lip service. Really

do it...Whenever you can.

(holding back tears)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

126.

I know I did, and I just wish my

dad could be here today, so after

this speech I could just walk down

into the audience and give him my

love right here...in front of all

of you. Thank you and good luck.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Like I promised, no prom night

highjinks, no nerds becoming

popular, no Shakespeare shoved up

your ass.

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And in case you're feeling guilty

about having no one to identify

with but me, relax...

MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...There's a first time for

everything.
