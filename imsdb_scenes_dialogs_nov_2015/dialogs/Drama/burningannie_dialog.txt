Max and Charles are here, standing, while Sam and Jen sit on

one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other.

Charles puts on his gloves and coat.

CHARLES

MAX

CHARLES

He gestures at Sam, who stands. Unlike the hipster from

freshman year, Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant.

There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back.

SAM

Jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval.

JEN

SAM

JEN

She glares. He teeters between his friends and his

girlfriend. His girlfriend wins. He sits back down, trying to

hide his disappointment.

SAM

The guys roll their eyes, let down but unsurprised.

Across the room are SCOTT, perpetually poker-faced and

reserved, and AMANDA, understated, with the subdued manner of

a long-suffering wallflower.

JULIE

And with that, she leaves. Max watches her, loses her in the

crowd. Something catches his eye across the room.

MAX'S POV: Sam is in a corner, trapped by an upset Jen. From

his gestures, he is on the defensive.

Charles moseys over.

Charles takes two mugs off the floor, throws their contents

Amanda takes the negatives, opens the door to a closet, hangs

them from a clothespin, and leaves. Max takes his, selects a

clothespin, and knocks several others to the floor. He tries

to pick them up, and manages to step on them.

He throws the crumpled negatives in the closet and grabs his

bag. At the door, he notices one stuck to his shoe.

MAX

He takes the negative off his shoe, almost knocking himself

over, and hurries out.

MARK

Mark glares disparagingly at him while Max pretends to

examine the ceiling. Julie pulls out cigarettes, lights up.

JULIE

Andy finds it: a gigantic bong made from a vacuum cleaner. He

sets it up on the counter.

MAX

ANDY

MARK

JULIE

Yeah. I used to, but when it became my

social life I knew I needed to stop.

MAX

Kind of like why I stopped playing

Dungeons and Dragons. It was, uh, in

sixth grade, but it was kind of similar.

MARK

Why don't we go smoke in the living room?

ANDY

Oh, Ampersand's crashing on the couch

tonight.

MAX

"Ampersand"? What kind of name is that,

Esperanto?

ANDY

Well, his name was Mike, but he couldn't

cope. He thought it was, like, too

square. He wanted a name that would tell

people, here is a person that only the

brave will understand! Here is a person

living beyond the walls!

MAX

He must have been listening to

"Apostrophe" at the time.

ANDY

Or Prince, cuz, like, Prince's name was a

squiggly-thing. But Mike wanted something

powerful, meaningful, and above all,

something you could type. Therefore,

"Ampersand." It's already on the keyboard

and everything.

MAX

How much did that cost? Because I have a

friend who wants to change his name to

Not Bill.

JULIE

Is his name Bill?

MAX

No, Not Bill.

JULIE

What about originally?

MAX

Mark steps forward and pushes up a sleeve.

MARK

He's got an anchor on his right biceps. Max snickers.

Sorry. That wasn't quite what I was

Now it's your turn, right?

JULIE

Let's see. Okay, here's one: I have a

boyfriend.

MAX

Fuck. I sure hadn't guessed that.

JULIE

Okay, well, not anymore. Eric and I were

together in high school, but we broke up

over break.

MAX

Since high school, wow.

JULIE

Yeah. He's kind of a jerk. It was all a

waste of time. Sometimes I, I, I don't

know, Max, why don't you have a

girlfriend?

MAX

Uh, I have a friend who says it's because

I watch Annie Hall too much.

JULIE

That's crazy.

MAX

Exactly. That film practically raised me.

Tommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the

TV and sits down. Max stares at him. Tommy suddenly realizes

he isn't alone.

He turns it off and quickly exits. Max tries to pull himself

together.

Julie leaves. The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects.

Max stares at it, upset and thoughtful.

He smiles and walks away. The fog begins to obscure him.

Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman. She hits POWER

and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO.

REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps

the headphones over her ears.

Finally, Beth turns and walks away.

CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller.

Soon all we see is fog.
