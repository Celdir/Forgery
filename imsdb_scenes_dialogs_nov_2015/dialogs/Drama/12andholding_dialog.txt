JACOB

You see `em?

RUDY

No. But that doesn't mean they're

not here.

RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Jacob, come on. It's cool.

2.

JACOB

What the hell is that?

RUDY

Piss.

KENNY

You and your deformed brother are

dead!

RUDY

(calling to Kenny)

Anytime you're ready, dickhead.

KENNY

They're fucking dead!

(CONTINUED)

3.

YACCO (O.S.)

The check is supposed to be here on

the first of the month... She's

your daughter, you asshole!

MALEE

Mom, I need help.

YACCO (INTO PHONE)

(ignoring her)

Any parent is "parent of the year"

next to you, you selfish prick.

MALEE

Move it, people.    Outta my way!

(CONTINUED)

4.

LEONARD

(mouthful)

You're late.

MALEE

Yeah well, I began menstruating

this morning, and I had some

difficulty inserting the tampon.

(off his disgusted look)

What? It's a natural process. You

know, I could conceive, carry and

birth a child right now.

LEONARD

Big deal.    You won't.

MALEE

But I could. That's what matters.

LEONARD

The twins said, they'd meet us at

the spot.

MALEE

Wanna race?

LEONARD

Nah, I'm good.

JACOB

Maybe I should have mom look at it.

RUDY

If you didn't have that damn mask

on, you'd have seen it coming. Our

birthday comes once a year, and you

ask for a hockey mask. You don't

even play.

JACOB

Jason from "Friday the 13th" wears

one. He's bad ass.

(CONTINUED)

5.

RUDY

Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home

`cause of a little blood. He'd get

back up, decapitate his victim and

move on.

JACOB

You think Jeff and Kenny will come

back?

RUDY

I dropped piss on their heads.    I'd

say the odds are pretty good.

MALEE (O.S.)

You did what?

RUDY

Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped

the piss I've been saving on their

heads.

LEONARD

Why were you saving piss?

RUDY

Just incase. Pretty smart, huh?

JACOB

No, it's stupid cause now they're

gonna come back here and kick all

our asses.

RUDY

Don't be such a pussy.

LEONARD

Yeah, I could probably take them

both myself.

RUDY

What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat

them?

JACOB

All I'm saying is, who cares if

they tear it down.

(CONTINUED)

6.

RUDY

This is OUR place. We've been

coming here since we were seven.

JACOB

Nothing lasts forever.

RUDY

You're such a butt-munch.

MALEE

You guys, it's your birthday.

Could you try and get along?

DEBBIE

I don't think therapy is helping.

YACCO

Why do you say that?   Are you still

"cutting"?

YACCO (cont'd)

Oh, Debbie.

DEBBIE

It feels much better than it looks.

Really.

MALEE

Ma, I... Oops.

YACCO

Malee, out. Now.

MALEE

I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED)

7.

YACCO

Excuse me for a moment.

YACCO

I told you a 100 times to knock.

MALEE

I said, I was sorry.

YACCO

Why aren't you with the boys?

MALEE

Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with

their parents.

YACCO

I found this in the backseat of my

car this morning. Do you know how

much flutes cost?   Go outside, sit

on the front steps and practice.

MALEE

But, mom.

YACCO

Now!

MALEE

Keep it moving. This ain't a show.

(CONTINUED)

8.

RUDY/JACOB

Cheese!

JIM

Okay, you got your small gifts this

morning. Now for the big ones.

ASHLEY

This one is Rudy's.

RUDY

Sony play station! Oh my God!      Oh

my God! Yes! Too cool!

JIM

Since neither of you wanted a party

this year, we were able to splurge.

JACOB

What is it?

ASHLEY

Only one way to find out.

JIM

Go ahead, read it.

JACOB

"Plastic Surgery.     Isn't it about

time?"

(horrified)

I don't get it.

ASHLEY

Your father and I are going to pay

to have your birthmark removed.

JIM

Isn't that great.

(CONTINUED)

9.

JACOB

You got me surgery for my birthday?

JIM

Not just one.     A series of them.

RUDY

(overcompensating)

Cool.

JACOB

It's not "cool".    It totally sucks!

JIM

Jacob?

RUDY

Don't sweat it. You can borrow my

play station anytime you want.

JACOB

This isn't about the play station.

It's about this thing on my face.

Everybody hates it.

RUDY

I don't.

JACOB

Who cares what you think? You're

the reason for all of this.

Perfect you with your perfect skin.

There to show the world what I'm

supposed to look like.

(beat)

You know, sometimes I just wish I

wasn't your twin.

RUDY

Screw you! Know what, I take it

back, you can't use my play

station.

10.

GABE

30 acres.

JIM

I already told you, Gabe, I'm not

selling that land. Not 30 acres

not five.

GABE

I'm willing to pay top dollar.

JIM

I'm not gonna let you tear down

those woods, so you can stack

twenty houses right on top of each

other.

GABE

I'm gonna write down a number.

JIM

No! My kids... hell, your kids

play in those woods all the time.

You can't put a price on that.

GABE

I believe I can.

(CONTINUED)

11.

SOCCER MOM # 1 (O.S.)

Look at them. So unhealthy.

SOCCER MOM # 1 (cont'd)

You know, Grace can barely walk

because of her weight.

SOCCER MOM # 2

Where do you think she finds

clothes big enough to fit?

PATRICK

Good eating, huh son?

LEONARD

Maybe you shouldn't have seconds,

Dad, you know?

PATRICK

Who are you, Richard Simmons?

C'mon, enjoy the day.

KENNY

(o.s. )

Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree

house of yours a little visit

tonight.

(CONTINUED)

12.

KENNY (cont'd)

When we're through, it'll be a pile

of scrap.

RUDY

Why don't you take your smelly ass

back to the trailer park?

KENNY

Free country, asshole.

RUDY

You got nothing better to do than

pick on us all the time?

KENNY

I did until yesterday.

RUDY

I thought you liked "golden

showers". Oh no, that was your

mother.

NEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.)

What's going on over there?

KENNY

I'll finish this tonight!

(CONTINUED)

13.

RUDY

Kenny showed up. He said, Jeff and

him are gonna tear the treehouse

down tonight. We gotta sneak out

and stop them.

JACOB

Mom and Dad would kill us.

RUDY

We can't let him tear it down.

JACOB

It's just a treehouse.

RUDY

No, it's not! You know what, you

suck. I'm going. Leonard, you in?

JACOB

You don't have to go if you don't

want to.

RUDY

Don't listen to him.     He's a pussy.

LEONARD

I'll go.

RUDY

Finally, someone with balls.

RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Let them go.

(CONTINUED)

14.

JACOB

Rudy.

RUDY

Unless you're coming with me, I

don't want to hear it.

RUDY (cont'd)

You know, you can't be a pussy all

your life.

JACOB

What?

RUDY

Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the

time, and you don't do shit.

JACOB

It's my problem.

RUDY

No, it's mine too. Cause we're

brothers. That's what brothers do.

They fight for each other, kill for

each other, die for each other.

JACOB

I don't feel that way.

RUDY

Cause you're a pussy. So stay

home, keep your head under the

blankets. I'm gonna fight.

FADE TO BLACK:

(CONTINUED)

15.

LEONARD

(re: snack cakes)

Some provisions.

RUDY

We're only gonna be here a couple

of hours.

LEONARD

When two o'clock rolls around,

you'll be begging for one of these.

LEONARD (cont'd)

(re: baseball bat)

I didn't bring my glove.

RUDY

Moron, the bat is for Jeff and

Kenny. You know, to scare them a

little.

RUDY (cont'd)

Maybe it's best if we don't talk.

Just listen. Listen for them, and

don't fall asleep.

LEONARD

I'm wide awake. I could stay up

all night.

LEONARD

Oh, shit.

(CONTINUED)

16.

RUDY

What... What is it?    They here?

LEONARD

No.

RUDY

Where you going?

LEONARD

They're not gonna show up, I'm

goin' home. It's three o'clock-

KENNY

Now yours.     And aim for the window.

KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Ha ha, you suck.

JEFF

You hear that?

RUDY

Put it out! Put it out!

(CONTINUED)

17.

JEFF

They're in there!   They're in

there!

KENNY

Wake up!   Wake up, kid!

JIM

Ashley?    What is it?

ASHLEY

I forgot to deposit your paycheck

last week.

JIM

But I already wrote some checks.

ASHLEY

I know. With the cookout and

everything, I forgot. I'll deposit

it tomorrow. The holiday should

buy us an extra day.

JIM

Write yourself a note so you don't

forget again.

ASHLEY

I just did.

(CONTINUED)

18.

ASHLEY (cont'd)

Goodnite.

FADE TO BLACK:

PRIEST

Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene

Carges. May God hold you in the

palm of his hand.

GUS

Friend or family?

MALEE

Huh?

GUS

The person who died.

MALEE

Friend.

GUS

I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung.

This is only my second session, but

she's good.

(CONTINUED)

19.

MALEE

I'm not a patient.     I'm her

daughter.

GUS

Oh.     I can see the resemblance.

MALEE

Are you trying to make me sick?

YACCO

Mr. Maitland?

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I'll be with you in a second.

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

So, how was it?

MALEE

It was a funeral, Mom.     How do you

think it was?

YACCO

I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let

Rudy's parents know I'm available

if they need to talk. I won't

charge for the sessions.

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You know, it's okay to cry.

MALEE

I know it's okay to cry. I don't

need you to tell me, it's okay to

cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.

YACCO

Okay.

(CONTINUED)

20.

MOTHER

Ashley, there's more than enough

food here.

ASHLEY

No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs.

It's right that I make them.

Where's the paprika?

ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Jesus, you put something down, and

it disappears.

MOTHER # 1

Ashley.

ASHLEY

Maybe I threw it out.

(CONTINUED)

21.

MOTHER # 1

Ashley.

ASHLEY

It's okay.

ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Not my baby! Please God not my son!

GRACE

This hospital is a nightmare. The

elevator is never there when you

need it.

PATRICK

Where are the girls?

GRACE

Haley took Sara up to the maternity

ward.

GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

How are you feeling?

LEONARD

My head hurts.

GRACE

You're lucky you didn't get killed.

(CONTINUED)

22.

LEONARD

I told you, I'm sorry.

GRACE

You try being awakened at four

o'clock in the morning by the

police saying, they have your son,

he's unconscious and on his way to

the hospital. I've never been so

scared in my life. And poor Rudy.

GRACE (cont'd)

What?

LEONARD

My best friend is dead!

GRACE

Eat this.    It'll make you feel

better.

LEONARD

I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't

taste anything anyway.

GRACE

Hospital food is always bland.

This has flavor.

LEONARD

No, it's because of my condition.

I can't taste or smell anything

anymore.

GRACE

What are you saying, condition?

What condition?

LEONARD

(shrugs)

My condition.

(CONTINUED)

23.

DOCTOR

Leonard has a condition.    It's

called Anosmia.

GRACE

Oh my God!     Is it serious?

DOCTOR

No. Anosmia is when a person

looses their sense of smell. It's

not uncommon in patients who suffer

serious head injuries.

Unfortunately, it's also affecting

his ability to taste. Again, not

uncommon.

PATRICK

Is it permanent?

DOCTOR

Depends on the patient.

GRACE

What do we do? He can't eat.

DOCTOR

He can eat. He just can't taste

what he's eating.

PATRICK

What she means is, he won't eat.

DOCTOR

Leonard's association with food is

no longer about taste. It's about

texture. While we may be partial

to sweet or salty foods, Leonard

will become partial to crunchy or

smooth ones. Once he settles on a

texture he likes, his appetite will

increase.

GRACE

I can't believe this is happening.

DOCTOR

Considering what Leonard could have

suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he

is severely overweight. A loss of

appetite may be a benefit.

24.

NURSE

How'd we do?

NURSE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You have to eat something. It may

not be gourmet, but you don't look

that finicky.

LEONARD

This stuff feels like shit in my

mouth.

NURSE

It's macaroni and cheese.

LEONARD

It feels gross. Like there's a

film on my tongue.

LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I don't like apples.

NURSE

So, you can't taste it, right?

Maybe you'll like the crunch.

25.

GABE

I'm leaving, Jim.    Again, so sorry.

JIM

Gabe, are you still interested in

buying the land? Because I accept

your offer.

GABE

This is hardly the time to talk

business.

JIM

Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear

them down and build. Build houses,

condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I

just don't want to recognize it

ever again.

SMASH CUT TO:

MALEE (O.S.)

It's gone!     It's all gone!

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking

out right now.

(CONTINUED)

26.

LEONARD

You holding up alright, Jacob?

LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I'm sorry. I wish I could have

done something.

JACOB

Jeff and Kenny were the ones that

started the fire. It was their

fault. Or maybe mine. I should of

been there.

MALEE

You wouldn't have been able to do

anything. And it could have been

you who died.

JACOB

I wish it was. You know the last

thing Rudy said to me? He said, I

can't be a pussy all my life. He

was right, I am. And Rudy might be

dead because of it.

MALEE

Don't say that.

(beat)

Why don't you talk to your parents

about this?

JACOB

They can't help me.

MALEE

Give them time. It'll get better.

JACOB

What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't

gone back to work yet. What if he

loses his job. We could lose our

house. I could be homeless.

MALEE

Then you'll stay with me.

LEONARD

Or me.

(CONTINUED)

27.

JACOB

We're best friends.    We...

MALEE

Oh my God.

JACOB

What?

MALEE

That guy. I like know him. He's

one of my mother's patients.

LEONARD

So?

MALEE

I've never seen a patient of hers

actually out and about.

(beat)

Should we go over and say "hi"?

JACOB

I just want to get out of here.

LEONARD

You coming, Malee?

LEONARD

Are we having company?

GRACE

No, this is all for you. Your

favorites; fried chicken,

spaghetti, pizza, french fries, and

chocolate cheesecake for dessert.

I made everything extra spicy, so

you can taste it.

(CONTINUED)

28.

LEONARD

Ma, it doesn't matter how spicy the

food is.

GRACE

So you're not even gonna try it?

LEONARD

I'm sure it's delicious.

GRACE

Forget it.     Don't eat.

GRACE (cont'd)

You can't just eat apples all the

time.

LEONARD

Why not?

GRACE

(beat, searching)

It's unhealthy.

TEACHER

Tommy Wallace.

TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Jacob Carges.

TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Rudy Carges.

(CONTINUED)

29.

TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Rudy Carges. Hello?

TOMMY

He's not in this class anymore.

TEACHER

How do you know?

JACOB

Cause he's dead.

TEACHER

I realize being new at this school

puts me at a disadvantage, but

joking about a fellow classmate's

death is anything but funny, Mr....

TEACHER (cont'd)

...Carges.     Wait, are you...

JACOB

I'm his brother. Was.     And I'm not

joking. He's dead.

TEACHER

I'm so sorry. Wow, this is

awkward. Would you like the seat

left empty?

JACOB

Why?

TEACHER

In memory.

30.

COACH

Alright, ladies, welcome to gym.

We will be starting things off this

year with the United States

Standardized Fitness Test.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I'm sure you all remember it from

last year. I will be testing you

in a number of physical fitness

areas.

SMASH CUT TO:

COACH (V.O.)

The state's requirement for upper

body strength is ten chin ups.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Leonard, you're up.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What are you doing, let's go!

LEONARD

That was as far as I could pull

myself up.

(CONTINUED)

31.

SMASH CUT TO:

COACH

Ten seconds. You need forty to

pass.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Time.   42.     Good job.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

(rolling his eyes)

Go!

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Come on, son, fight it.

COACH

23 minutes.

LEONARD

Not bad.

COACH

The goal was 8.

(CONTINUED)

32.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Hit the showers.

COACH (cont'd)

Not you Leonard.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Center. That's the position you'll

be playing in two years.

LEONARD

Football?

COACH

You don't like football?

LEONARD

I love it. It's just I'll never

make the weight requirement. Pop

Warner league wouldn't let me play

for five years because of it.

COACH

There's no weight requirement in

high school ball, son.

COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

These are your new bibles.

LEONARD

Books?

COACH

One is on nutrition, the other

exercise. You do what they say,

and you can play for me once you

get to high school.

LEONARD

Thanks.

(CONTINUED)

33.

LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Coach, why are you doing this for

me?

COACH

Because I've never seen a child so

out of shape in my life.

MR FARMER

(annoyed)

Did anyone practice over the

summer?

MR. FARMER

Great. Well, we still have a fall

recital coming up. If anyone would

like to perform a solo, sign up on

the sheet outside my office. Class

dismissed.

(CONTINUED)

34.

ASHLEY

No, they're wrong.    Call them back.

JIM

Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.   He

wouldn't lie.

JACOB

What's going on?

ASHLEY

This is all your fault.

JIM

Me?

ASHLEY

If we had gone to the hearings like

I said, this wouldn't be happening.

JIM

We agreed it would be too painful.

ASHLEY

You agreed.

JACOB

Mom, what happened?

ASHLEY

Tell him.    Tell your son.

JIM

The boys who killed Rudy cut a

deal. They got a year in juvinile

hall and five years probation.

ASHLEY

A year. That's what your brother's

life is worth. A damn year!

JIM

Ashley, calm down!

ASHLEY

How can you be so unaffected by

this! How? Our son was murdered!

(CONTINUED)

35.

JIM

(measured)

It was an accident, and the boys

are juveniles.

ASHLEY

So that makes it okay?

FADE TO BLACK:

MALEE (O.S.)

Don't I know you?

(CONTINUED)

36.

GUS

Dr. Chung's daughter.

MALEE

You remembered. We were never

introduced. My name is Malee.

GUS

Gus.

GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What are you doing here?

MALEE

I was in the mood for a picnic. I

thought this would be a nice place

to have one.

WORKER (O.S.)

Asshole, move your fucking truck!

MALEE

Would you like to join me?   There's

plenty of food.

GUS

I don't go to lunch for another ten

minutes.

MALEE

I'll wait. Meet me by the cement

mixer when you're ready.

(CONTINUED)

37.

GUS

The last time I saw you, you had

just come from a funeral. How are

you doing?

MALEE

Okay. Death is like so weird. I

mean, it's sad, but I also feel

like I've been given this sign. A

sign which is telling me, life is

short, so you gotta do what makes

you happy. You gotta take chances.

You gotta get crazy.

GUS

What are you doing to "get crazy"?

MALEE

I play the flute.

GUS

(laughs)

Yeah, that's totally nuts.

MALEE

No, not that. See, every year my

school has this recital. I've

always been too scared to play a

solo in front of people, but this

year I've decided to do it.

GUS

Good for you. When is it?

MALEE

Why do you care?

GUS

Cause I'm gonna go.

MALEE

What? You can't go!    Nobody goes

to these things. I don't even

think my mom is going.

GUS

You gotta have somebody rooting for

ya. Besides, I like music, and I

owe you for bringing me lunch.

(CONTINUED)

38.

MALEE

(laughs, embarrassed)

Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the

junior high school auditorium.

GUS

I'll be there.

MALEE

(vulnerable)

Don't say it if you don't mean it.

GUS

I'll be there.      Front row.

CUT TO:

LEONARD

I can't believe how much you suck

at this game.

LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You wanna play again?

JACOB

No.

LEONARD

You wanna shoot some hoops?

JACOB

No.

(beat)

The sentencing thing totally upset

my mom. She was up half the night,

crying.

(CONTINUED)

39.

LEONARD

I can't believe it either. A year

ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever.

JACOB

I want them dead. I want to kill

them. I could handle a year in

Juvy hall.

MALEE

Whoa, what those guys did was an

accident. If you were to kill

them, it's premedicated. You'd get

20 years to life at least.

JACOB

So I'm just supposed to sit here

and take it? Be like you guys.

LEONARD

What is that supposed to mean?

JACOB

You seem to have gone on with life

pretty easily. Don't you miss him?

Don't you care?

MALEE

It's not that we don't care.     It's

just...

JACOB

Life goes on.

MALEE

It does. You have to deal with it.

If you don't, it could like eat you

alive forever. 90 percent of

people's problems is due to their

inability to get over the past.

LEONARD

How do you know?

MALEE

My mom tells that to all her

patients. I've eavesdropped on

some of her therapy sessions.

(CONTINUED)

40.

LEONARD

That's awesome. Can I listen in

sometime?

MALEE

No. Anyway, she says, if a person

wants closure, they gotta deal with

their problems head on. Go see

these guys and let them know how

you feel.

JACOB

I don't think my parents would be

up for that.

MALEE

Go alone. Juvy hall is only like

forty minutes from here. Take the

bus.

JACOB

Bye, Dad.

41.

JACOB

Where's Jeff?

KENNY

He's sick.     I think he...

JACOB

(interrupting)

I hate you. You know that?     You

bastard.

KENNY

Rudy knew we were going to be

there. He never should have come.

You want the truth, all this

happened cause of you.

JACOB

Me?

KENNY

Yeah, you deformed retard! The

only reason we started picking on

you guys in the first place was

because of that thing on your face.

JACOB

Every night, I lie in bed and plan

your murder.

KENNY

I'm shaking.

JACOB

First I'm going to take a kitchen

knife and chop off your fingers

then your nose then your tongue.

Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes

with the end of a broomstick.

Well, not really poke them out, but

I'm gonna push them back into your

brain. Then I'm gonna take

scissors and cut off your ears.

When they find you, it's gonna be

like putting a jigsaw puzzle back

together.

(CONTINUED)

42.

KENNY

If you kill me, you come here.

JACOB

So? What do I have to look forward

to? You've already destroyed my

life.

KENNY

What happened was an accident.

JACOB

There are no accidents. You're

gonna pay for what you did. And

it's gonna hurt like hell.

GRACE

What the hell is this?

LEONARD

I'm reading the list of ingredients

in our foods.

GRACE

Why?

LEONARD

Research. Do you know the damage

these chemicals can do to the human

body?

GRACE

Leonard, put everything back.

LEONARD

This is serious. You can't keep

buying this crap. Don't you care

that you're ingesting garbage?

(CONTINUED)

43.

GRACE

Just put everything back and go to

sleep.

YACCO (FROM BELOW)

How was your week?

GUS (FROM BELOW)

Same. Still can't sleep. When I

do, nightmares.

YACCO

Post traumatic stress is very

common in your line of work. Many

fire fighters go through this.

GUS

Yeah. But why now? I haven't

fought fires in ten years.

YACCO

Sometimes we experience something

so horrific, our memory blocks it

out. That way we won't have to

relive the pain. It's called

repression. Our bodies are not so

forgiving, however. Inside, we

feel the effects of trauma even

when we don't know why.

GUS

What does that mean?

(CONTINUED)

44.

YACCO

Something stirred your unconscious.

If we find out what that was, we

can begin the healing process.

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You told me last week, the

nightmares started about the time

you moved here. Let's look at

that. Why did you move here?

GUS

A friend was making good money with

construction. He got an offer to

build that extension off Lindsay

Acres. He suggested I come into

town and work for a while.

YACCO (FROM BELOW)

Are there any other reoccurring

elements in your dreams. Perhaps,

a face or...

GUS

"Light my Fire" is always playing.

YACCO

What?

GUS

Light my fire. The Doors song.

(singing)

"Da da something... wallow in the

mire... Da, da... we couldn't get

much higher. Come on baby light my

fire.

YACCO

Interesting.

45.

JACOB

Dad?

JIM

Jacob.

JACOB

You okay?

JIM

Fantastic.

JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You know, for the past few weeks, I

sat in this house. I couldn't

move. Everything reminded me of

Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I

had a revelation. I am alive!

Your mother is alive! I became

overcome with joy because I

realized how lucky we are to still

have you.

JACOB

Me?

JIM

Jacob.   I love you.

(CONTINUED)

46.

JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)

(half crazed)

I went to work today. For the

first time in weeks. It was as if

I had just gotten out of college!

I was fearless! I went after

accounts I had avoided for years

because I thought they were out of

my league. I spoke to presidents,

vice presidents, business managers,

sales reps. I was amazing. I was

magic. But when I came home to

share the news with your mother, I

discovered her asleep. When I

looked around the house, I realized

that her "office", for lack of a

better word, was also piled up.

So, I took to the house. I have

made it my duty to clean this place

from top to bottom. Even if it

takes me all night, I don't care.

Jacob?

JACOB

(frightened)

Yeah?

JIM

Will you join me? Join me in this

celebration of life. A symbolic

gesture of cleaning out the old and

bringing in the new.

JACOB

Do I have to?

JIM

(thrown for a loop)

No, you don't have to.

JACOB

Good night, Dad.

47.

MR. FARMER

I'm sure Bette Midler would be most

impressed with that rendition.

MR. FARMER (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Anyway, our next soloist is Malee

Chung. She will play the theme

from "Love Story" on the flute.

MALEE

Thank you, Mr. Farmer.

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

There's actually been a change.

I'm not going to play the theme

from "Love Story". Um... this is a

song...

MALEE (INTO MICROPHONE) (CONT'D)

(to Mr. Farmer)

What? I can't hear you?

(CONTINUED)

48.

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Anyway.    This is a song by The

Doors.

MALEE

Where's Jacob?

LEONARD

Couldn't make it. He...

GUS (O.S.)

Malee.

MALEE

Oh my God!     He's coming over.

LEONARD

Who?

MALEE

Shut up!     Leave now.

GUS

You were awesome.

MALEE

Really? Be honest. I'd rather you

tell me I sucked then lie.

GUS

You were great.

(CONTINUED)

49.

MALEE

Excuse me for a second.

LEONARD

Ow, ow, ow alright.    I'm going.

MALEE

So you really enjoyed it?

GUS

Yeah. Good song.      What made you

pick it?

MALEE

(covering)

Oh, uh... my mother was humming it

all last week. Big Doors fan.

GUS

Really?   Is she here?

MALEE

No.

GUS

She missed out.

MALEE

You're so sweet.

GUS

Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks

again. I had a great time.

(CONTINUED)

50.

GRACE

That boy is going to bring the

entire house down.

PATRICK

Let him be. He's looking good.

I'm proud of him.

GRACE

(to the girls)

Girls, have you decided what you're

going to go as for Halloween?

SARA

Either a witch or a princess.

GRACE

That's nice. Haley?

HALEY

I'm going to go as a marble.

GRACE

What do you mean, a marble?

HALEY

You know, like a bag of marbles,

but just one marble.

JEFF

I'm really sorry, man.   I...

(CONTINUED)

51.

JACOB

You just think about what I said.

Get out of my sight. And send

Kenny in on your way out.

KENNY

What did you say to him?

JACOB

I thought you'd both like to know

that Halloween was Rudy's favorite

holiday.

JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)

These are pictures from every

single Halloween since we were

five. You see how happy he was?

KENNY

Stop it.

JACOB

After we'd go trick or treating,

we'd sit in our room and swap the

candy we hated. Rudy loved

Snickers, I Almond Joys.

KENNY

Almond Joy sucks.

JACOB

What sucks is that I'll never get

to sit in my room and swap candy

with my brother ever again. Thanks

to you.

KENNY

Why are you doing this?

JACOB

To remind you.

(CONTINUED)

52.

KENNY

How could we forget? You been

coming here for months to "remind

us".

JACOB

No one is forcing you to talk to

me.

KENNY

Anything to get out of my cell.

JACOB

Is your cell small?

KENNY

Yes.

JACOB

So is a coffin.

KENNY

You're not the only one who wishes

he was still alive. I'd do

anything to bring him back, but I

can't. It's not easy being in

here. Hell, you saw Jeff.

JACOB

What happened to him?

KENNY

He pissed off the wrong guy off.

Jeff is totally fucked right now.

JACOB

Good.

KENNY

Don't come back here ever again.

JACOB

Free country. I'll come if I want.

KENNY

Don't expect me to show up.

53.

GRACE

Be careful now.   Have a good night.

GRACE

Kids keep coming later every year.

HALEY

I hate him! I hate him!

GRACE

Who?    What happened?

HALEY

Leonard! He threw away all our

Halloween candy.

GRACE/PATRICK

What?

SARA

He grabbed our bags and just threw

them down a gutter.

PATRICK

What the hell is going on? Why did

you throw away their candy?

LEONARD

Because their sugar intake is

completely unhealthy. Besides,

Halloween is supposed to be a

celebration of evil. How did candy

get wrapped into it?

(CONTINUED)

54.

GRACE

I am going to ask you this once,

and I want a straight answer. Are

you in a cult?

PATRICK

Grace!

GRACE

This is what happens when kids join

cults. The first thing they change

is their diets.

LEONARD

I'm not in a cult. This is all

information you can find in books.

GRACE

The issue here is that you have

stolen one of the most exciting

nights of the year from your

sisters.

PATRICK

If anybody had done this to you

when you were a child, we never

would have heard the end of it.

LEONARD

I wish somebody had done it to me.

I wish either one of you had given

a shit about my weight.

PATRICK

I do not care for your language.

LEONARD

I'm only trying to help you guys.

LEONARD (cont'd)

You're fat dad. Mom is fat.   Us

kids are fat.

(CONTINUED)

55.

PATRICK

What's your point?

LEONARD

Dad, you and mom are going to die

young if you keep eating as poorly

as you do.

PATRICK

What is this obsession you have

with weight?

LEONARD

The coach for Jefferson High is

also my gym teacher. He told me

that if I got into shape, I could

start as center for the Freshman

team when I get to high school.

PATRICK

Center is a great position.

Toughest guy on the field. A good

center can make or break a team.

LEONARD

I know.   That's why I'm trying so

hard to get into shape. You guys

should to. At the rate you're

going, you won't make it to your

60's.

PATRICK

Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a

tasty meal is just a way of showing

she cares.

LEONARD

She doesn't! Tonight she served

spaghetti and meatballs from a can.

The amount of sodium alone can

wreck havoc on a person's blood

pressure. Not to mention...

PATRICK

Leonard, people just don't drop

dead from eating meatballs.

(CONTINUED)

56.

GUS

I can't take your Halloween candy.

MALEE

You'll be doing me a favor.

Chocolate gives you zits. Besides,

if I want to keep this firm ass as

an adult, I gotta develop good

eating habits now.

GUS

(uncomfortable)

Maybe just a snickers.

MALEE

So work is good?

GUS

To be honest, I can't wait till

this job is finished. This place

is creepy. You know, a boy died

here like right before we started

working.

MALEE

Rudy.   His name was Rudy.

GUS

You knew him?

MALEE

He was one of my best friends.

Remember that funeral I went to?

GUS

That was him?

MALEE

I thought you knew. Two boys threw

a flaming cocktail at him. Can you

imagine killing someone like that?

How evil can you get?

57.

ASHLEY

Jeff Laskey is dead.

JIM

What?

ASHLEY

He committed suicide in his jail

cell last night. Sally Yngve

called just now to tell me.

JACOB

Why are you smiling?    A boy died.

ASHLEY

No, a monster that murdered my son

died. Justice is served; end of

story.

(CONTINUED)

58.

KENNY

He used his bed sheet, waited until

lights out and then jumped.

JACOB

That's terrible.

KENNY

His cell mate let him hang there

the entire night.

JACOB

I'm sorry, Kenny.

KENNY

Like you even give a shit. I bet

when you heard, you started

dancing.

JACOB

No.

KENNY

I knew he wouldn't make it. It's

my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint

when I met him, but he sure as hell

wasn't headed here.

(tearing up)

That fucking asshole!

JACOB

An IPOD!   Sweet!

(CONTINUED)

59.

ASHLEY

You like it?

JACOB

I love it.     You guys went crazy

this year.

JIM

I'm going to shower.

ASHLEY

Jim, Jacob still has one more

present.

JIM

I thought we were going to wait.

JACOB

No, do it now! Now!

ASHLEY

After serious debate, your father

and I have decided... to adopt A

BABY!

JACOB

What?

JIM

We're gonna adopt a baby.

Hopefully a boy.

LEONARD

May I be excused?

(CONTINUED)

60.

GRACE

No!

MALEE

Why do I have to do this? It's

Christmas break.

YACCO

You'll be one step ahead in

January.

MALEE

Just because you're an atheist, I

don't get to celebrate the

holidays.

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Don't you find it hard not

believing in anything?

YACCO

Malee.

MALEE

I'm going for a bike ride.

YACCO

There's a foot of snow outside.

MALEE

The streets are ploughed. Besides,

I like looking at all the lights.

YACCO

Be home in an hour. Be careful.

61.

62.

MALEE

Freeze!   That's right.

(CONTINUED)

63.

LEONARD

Don't worry, white male infants are

the hardest to come by. 60 minutes

did a whole story on it.

MALEE

Since when do you watch 60 minutes?

LEONARD

Since I was in the hospital. They

said, any adoption agency worth its

salt has at least a three year

waiting list. By the time your

parents get a kid, you'll be in

college. You think they'll want to

start over again with that baby

shit?

JACOB

No, but it's like they're trying to

replace Rudy.

LEONARD

It doesn't matter cause it's not

gonna happen.

MALEE

I'm thirsty.

(to Leanard)

Can you get us some drinks?

LEONARD

Why me?

MALEE

Because it's the gentlemanly thing

to do.

JACOB

I'll get the drinks.

MALEE

I'll go with you.

LEONARD

Why are you all of a sudden going

to get the drinks?

(CONTINUED)

64.

MALEE

(bitchy)

Because you've upset me, and I

don't want to see you right now.

LEONARD

Fine, I'll get the drinks.

MALEE

I need a favor. It's big. I need

you to hide something for me.

JACOB

Hide what?

MALEE

Promise, you won't freak.

JACOB

I won't.

JACOB (cont'd)

Holy shit!

MALEE

You said, you wouldn't freak!

JACOB

That's a gun.

MALEE

I know.

JACOB

Where'd you get it?

MALEE

I can't tell you. I just need you

to hide it for a while. When all

is cool, I'll come for it.

JACOB

Why can't you keep it?

(CONTINUED)

65.

MALEE

My mother is a total snoop. She

goes through my stuff like all the

time.

(beat)

Please, Jacob. Somebody's life

might depend on it.

JACOB

Is it loaded?

MALEE

No, but I do have some bullets.

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Sure your parents won't find it?

JACOB

Nobody has the combination, but me.

Besides, I could be building a bomb

in here, and they wouldn't even

know.

FADE TO BLACK:

JACOB

I sent in some comics for ya.   The

X-men one is pretty sweet.

(CONTINUED)

66.

KENNY

That last batch was awesome.

JACOB

I better get going, I don't want to

miss my bus.

KENNY

Before you go, I got some news.

Apparently, the parole board feels

I've been a model prisoner, so

they're giving me early release.

JACOB

What?   How can they do that?

KENNY

I don't know. They just did.

You're pissed, aren't you? I knew

you would be.

(off Jacob's silence)

It was an accident, Jacob.

JACOB

So you're getting out.   Gonna head

back to school, or...

KENNY

Fuck school. I'm going to live

with my Dad in New Mexico. He's

working on a ranch out there.

JACOB

You can't leave the state. That

violates your probation. You'll

have to...

KENNY

My dad won't tell anyone. No one

will even care I'm out there.

JACOB

Your mom will.

KENNY

Jacob, in the entire time I've been

locked up, you were the only one

who came to see me. Trust me, she

won't care.

67.

MALEE

200 dollars! Dad sent me 200

dollars!

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I have to call him.

YACCO

No!

(covering)

Your father... went out.     He's not

home right now.

MALEE

You're acting weird.     What's going

on?

YACCO

Nothing.

MALEE

Well, do you want to come with me

to the mall and spend it?

YACCO

I'd prefer it if you'd put that

money in the bank.

(off Malee's look)

Fine, spend it. You'll have to do

it alone though. I have a patient

this afternoon. Have a good day.

PATRICK

Here's the deal. You know how my

company flies me to Florida every

April?

(CONTINUED)

68.

LEONARD

You and I have been going since I

was eight. It's the guy's week

off.

PATRICK

This year, I'm taking the girls.

Just the girls. You're staying

home.

LEONARD

Why can't we all go?

GRACE

I'm not staying here all alone.

Besides, you said it yourself,

you've been going for years. Give

your sisters a chance.

LEONARD

Whatever.

(beat)

I need money.

PATRICK

What for?

LEONARD

Clothes.    Nothing I have fits

anymore.

GRACE

Your father and I aren't rich. You

can't get a new wardrobe anytime

you want.

LEONARD

What am I supposed to do, go to

school naked?

GRACE

Wear a belt.

PATRICK

I'll give him some cash, he can get

some clothes.

GRACE

No. He's gonna gain all his weight

back in a few months.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

69.

GRACE (cont'd)

Then what, we have to buy him new

clothes all over again?

PATRICK

Grace.

GRACE

What?    It's true.

JACOB (O.S.)

I thought you hated going to

Florida?

LEONARD

When I was fat. Now I don't have

to wear a T-shirt when I go

swimming. Who knows, maybe I could

even get lucky.

JACOB

You're still ugly, though.

LEONARD

I don't understand what my mother's

problem is. It's like the thinner

I get, the more she hates me.

JACOB

She's probably jealous. Maybe you

should put her on that diet.

LEONARD

Anytime I mention it, my mother

goes crazy.

JACOB

If you really want her to drop a

few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's

lost about 30 pounds since he's

been incarcerated, and he was

already thin.

(CONTINUED)

70.

LEONARD

Really?

JACOB

Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight

loss program. You take a fat tub,

throw them in a room and force them

to eat right and exercise. Don't

let them out till they do.

YACCO

Malee, dinner!

YACCO (cont'd)

Malee?

(noticing something)

Oh my God!

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What did you do?

MALEE

I got a new look. You know, for

Spring. What do you think?

YACCO

You look...

MALEE

Beautiful?

YACCO

Different. What happened to your

glasses?

(CONTINUED)

71.

MALEE

Contacts. It took me like forty

five minutes to get them in, but

beauty is pain.

YACCO

Honey, in the future, I'd like to

know if you're going to radically

change your appearance. Clean your

stuff up and come down for dinner.

GUS

Malee?   My God, you look...

MALEE

Different?

GUS

Beautiful.     You look beautiful.

MALEE

I felt like I needed a change, you

know?

GUS

I bet you're driving the boys at

school wild.

MALEE

Boys my age are so immature. I'm

more attracted to older gentlemen.

(CONTINUED)

72.

GUS

You don't want somebody that much

older than you. An age difference

can cause problems.

MALEE

What kind of problems?

GUS

A lot of times when a couple has an

age difference, they wind up

splitting up because they want

different things.

MALEE

You mean sex.

GUS

No.

GUS (cont'd)

I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a

boy even three years older than you

is probably more "experienced".

Boys can be impatient about that

sort of thing.

MALEE

Are you impatient?

GUS

No, but when I was a kid.

MALEE

Why don't you have a girlfriend?

GUS

I did, but it didn't work out.

MALEE

How old was she?

GUS

About my age.

MALEE

See that, age wasn't an issue, yet

you still wanted different things.

I don't think it's about age.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

73.

MALEE (cont'd)

I think when two people connect,

they connect for other reasons.

And since soulmates are eternal,

they have no age.

LEONARD

(calling after them)

Have a good flight!

ASHLEY

We're home.

JACOB

Hi.

ASHLEY

Could you come downstairs for a

minute. We have a surprise for

you.

74.

JIM

This is Keith Gardner. You're new

brother. Keith our son, Jacob.

KEITH

It's nice to meet you.

JACOB

You get top bunk.

KEITH

I'm kind of afraid of heights.

JACOB

Sucks to be you.

JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)

No offence, but I never thought my

future brother would be a... well,

a "brother".

KEITH

I never thought my future brother

would have a KOOL AID stain,

smeared across his face.

JACOB

Fuck you, it's a birthmark!

KEITH

We're getting off on the wrong

foot.

(CONTINUED)

75.

JACOB

When my parents said they were

taking in an orphan, I pictured a

baby. So what happened, your

parents die or something?

KEITH

I was given up at birth.

JACOB

You gonna try and find your mother

when you're 18?

KEITH

As far as I'm concerned, the fact

she had me was enough. I don't

need to show up one day and disrupt

her life.

JACOB

Oh, but it's okay to just show up

one day and disrupt mine?

JACOB

He's not some baby.   He's like 10.

KENNY

You're blaming me for this?

JACOB

No.   But can you believe it?

(CONTINUED)

76.

KENNY

Maybe this is the only way they can

get over Rudy's death.

JACOB

He's a person not a fucking vase.

KENNY

I know.

JACOB

I gotta get out of there. I can't

live in that house for one more

day. I want to go with you to New

Mexico.

KENNY

No way. You've never even   been

out on the road.

JACOB

So.

KENNY

It's not easy. After first night

falls, you'll be pissing yourself.

JACOB

No, I won't.

KENNY

You don't need me to run away from

home.

JACOB

That's not what this is about.

KENNY

Yes, it is.

(beat)

And you want to come with ME of all

people. Are you forgetting, I was

the one who killed Rudy!

JACOB

That was an accident.

(CONTINUED)

77.

JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I'll be helpful. I can get

everything we'll need together. As

soon as you're released, we can go.

JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Please.

KENNY

If this is what you want.   Alright.

YACCO (INTO PHONE)

... I'm not asking for much. Just

call her from time to time...

Because she needs to know her

father cares... Call collect.

MALEE

Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?

YACCO

Take some responsibility for

yourself and grow... Hello?...

YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

He hung up.

MALEE

Well, what do you expect?   All you

ever do is yell at him.

YACCO

Malee, you don't understand.

MALEE

He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it

bothers you, but I love him. You

keep this up then one day, when I'm

old enough, I'll leave here and go

and stay with him.

I hope someone is hungry.

GRACE

Get me out of here now!

LEONARD

No joke, Ma. For the next two

weeks while Dad and the girls are

away, you will be kept down here.

I'll provide you with nutritious

meals and plenty of water. You,

mother, will learn what it means to

be healthy.

GRACE

That's what this is about, food?

LEONARD

I'm trying to save your life, mom.

Trying to give you a life. Cause I

love you.

GRACE

My life is fine.   I don't need you

to "save me".

LEONARD

You don't even realize how sick you

are. It's a problem when an

otherwise healthy woman can't drag

her ass up a flight of stairs

because she's so obese. You're

staying down here.

Oh, and no cigarettes either.

No, I just...

JACOB

Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING

in this room is mine. You are not

allowed to touch a thing,

especially the glove.

KEITH

Okay, okay.

JACOB

If you tell my parents what I said,

I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in

the fucking face, I swear it!

(CONTINUED)

84.

JACOB

(cold)

What's wrong now?

ASHLEY

I was looking at a picture of you

and Rudy when you were born. God,

I miss him.

JACOB

But you have Keith now

ASHLEY

What the hell does that mean?

JACOB

You have Keith. Two boys again.

Everything is fine.

ASHLEY

We didn't adopt Keith to replace

Rudy.

JACOB

Didn't you?

ASHLEY

For your information, your father

and I discussed adopting for years.

JACOB

(not buying it)

Right. Maybe if it was me who

died, you wouldn't need another kid

to get over it.

ASHLEY

How can you say that? I never

wanted either of my children to

die.

JACOB

But one of us did. If you had to

choose which one, I bet you wish it

was me.

(CONTINUED)

85.

ASHLEY

I know you think we favored Rudy...

JACOB

You did!    Admit it.

ASHLEY

I admit he was easier to raise, but

we didn't love him more. Jacob,

listen to me. You came with a

different set of challenges.

JACOB

My birthmark.

ASHLEY

It's not easy being different...

JACOB

(screams)

I'm not different!! You always

made me feel like something was

wrong. There's nothing wrong with

me.

ASHLEY

I know...

JACOB

No, you don't! It's like you don't

know how to deal with me. You

never did.

ASHLEY

I'm sorry if that is how you feel.

You do the best you can as a

parent. You don't always know

what's right. But you're my son.

I'd do anything for you. I'd fight

for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die

for you.

JACOB

Rudy used to say that exact same

thing.

ASHLEY

It's true. And as unchristian as

it sounds, I still want the boy

that killed Rudy dead. Someday,

when you grow up, you'll understand

what I mean. Someday.

CUT TO:

GRACE

When Pat calls, and I don't answer,

he'll know something is wrong.

He'll know. I'll be fine.

GRACE

Open this door now! Let me out,

God damn it! Leonard!

87.

YACCO

Before we begin, I want to

apologize. I should have known

what was going on with Malee.

GUS

It's my fault. I knew she had a

crush on me. I guess, I felt bad

for her. She's a very unhappy

girl.

GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)

If it's any consolation, the whole

thing was very "therapeutic" for

me.

(off Yacco's look)

Sorry. That was a very selfish

thing to say.

YACCO

This is your therapy. Not mine.

Why was it therapeutic?

GUS

I slept last night. I can't

remember the last time I slept so

deep or so sound. I don't remember

dreaming or anything.

YACCO

Why do you think that is?

GUS

One of the last fires I ever fought

was a brownstone, beautiful. The

place was burned from roof to

basement. Whole family was wiped

out. When I was upstairs,

inspecting, I found a girl. She

couldn't have been more than 12.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

88.

GUS (cont'd)

The whole right side of her face

was burnt off, but her eyes were

open. She was alive. The pain must

have been excruciating. She was

begging for me to... kill her.

YACCO

What did you do?

GUS

Exactly what she wanted. I placed

my hand over her mouth and what was

left of her nose, and I... I killed

her. I told myself it was the

right thing to do, but I've never

been sure.

YACCO

What does this have to do with

Malee?

GUS

When I saw her last night, she had

the same look on her face as that

girl. She just wanted me to take

away her pain.

GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Doctor?

YACCO

Would you mind if we... cut out

early today? No charge.

GUS

I understand.

(CONTINUED)

89.

MALEE (INTO PHONE)

Hello?... Daddy!... No, she's not

home... Can I ask you something?

Can I visit you for a while?... A

week... But I can fly alone... No,

I understand... Yeah... I love y...

Hello?...

YACCO (O.S.)

Honey?

MALEE

(through her tears)

Why does he hate me?

90.

GRACE

Leonard!

GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Leonard, I smell gas!

GRACE

Leonard, don't you smell that...?

(sotto)

Oh God, he can't. Leonard!

Leonard, the gas is on!

GRACE

No!

(CONTINUED)

91.

GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Leonard, wake up! Leonard!

NURSE

It's alive!

LEONARD

What happened?

NURSE

Gas leak.

LEONARD

My mom, she's...

NURSE

She's fine. They've taken her into

surgery. She blew out her knees

somehow. We're trying to get your

father on the phone right now.

LEONARD

I...

NURSE

Shh. You need your rest.

Everything is fine now.

KENNY (O.S.)

Tonight, we ride.

KENNY

We got sleeping bags, a tent,

canteens and a lantern.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

92.

KENNY (cont'd)

I heard it's supposed to rain, so

I'll bring ponchos.

JACOB

(half hearted)

Cool.

KENNY

You're acting weird.    You gonna

chicken out?

JACOB

No.

KENNY

You better not. I already packed

twice the amount of shit. I can't

carry it all alone.

JACOB

I'll be there.

KENNY

Good. I'm telling you, man. It's

gonna be great.

JACOB

I guess.

KENNY

Come on. You can't be a pussy all

your life.

JACOB

(beat, hauntingly)

I know.

KENNY

I'll see you tonight.    Don't be

late.

GRACE

Leonard!

(CONTINUED)

93.

LEONARD

I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to

leave the gas on. It was an

accident. And everything that

happened, I... I just thought that

maybe, I could help you.

GRACE

Leonard, my mother died at 52. We

had to cremate her body because

they didn't make a coffin big

enough for her to fit in. Even if

they had, no one could have carried

it.

(tearing up)

I loved her so much. I don't want

that to happen to me.

LEONARD

It doesn't have to.

GRACE

Even if I can manage the food...

Can you honestly see me, running a

marathon?

LEONARD

You don't have to run a marathon.

You just have to run to the end of

the block. It's not so hard as you

think it is.

GRACE

I'll try.

GRACE (cont'd)

I spoke to your father. He and the

girls caught a flight. They should

be here by morning.

LEONARD

Did you tell him what happened?

GRACE

I told him there was a gas leak.

LEONARD

I meant...

(CONTINUED)

94.

GRACE

I know what you meant. I didn't

tell him. I don't think I will.

KENNY

You're late.

JACOB

I'm here.

KENNY

Put this on.

KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What the fuck is that?

JACOB

If people see me riding around in

the middle of the night, we're

screwed. You didn't bring a

disguise?

(CONTINUED)

95.

KENNY

Who gives a shit what I'm up to.

KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

The main road is this way.

JACOB

Yeah, but if we cut through the

construction site, we'll hit the

railroad tracks. It's faster and

no one will bother us.

KENNY

Good point.

KENNY

What's wrong?

JACOB

I can't do this.

KENNY

What?!

96.

KENNY

Son of a bitch! I knew it.     I knew

you'd chicken...

KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What the fuck?

JACOB

I can't let you leave, Kenny.     You

have to pay for what you did.

KENNY

Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I...

I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll

do my probation.

JACOB

You killed him. I gotta do this...

for my family. It's the only way.

KENNY

Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an

accident. I swear. Please, don't.

This isn't you.

JACOB

I know. But I can't be a pussy all

my life.

(CONTINUED)

97.

KEITH

I thought I wasn't supposed to

touch this.

JACOB

You're awake.

KEITH

Yeah.

JACOB

It's yours. Just don't leave it

outside. If it gets wet, the

leather will crack.

KEITH

I'll take good care of it.   I know

this was Rudy's.

KEITH (cont'd)

Why do you have a gun?

JACOB

Just a b-b gun. I returned it to a

friend of mine.

(beat)

I'm sorry for being such an asshole

to ya.

KEITH

Does this mean we're brothers now?

(CONTINUED)

98.

JACOB

(beat, torn apart)

Yeah. We're brothers.

MALEE (O.S.)

Gus?

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Before you freak out, I want to

tell you, I'm sorry. And to give

you this.

GUS

Malee?

MALEE

Don't be mad. I was just worried

about you. Now I'm out of your

life forever. Goodbye. Thanks for

not pressing any charges.

MALEE

Quite a storm last night.

MALEE (cont'd)

Did you hear about Leonard?

(CONTINUED)

99.

MALEE (cont'd)

Only him. I was gonna go and visit

him at the hospital. You want to

come?

MALEE (cont'd)

Earth to Jacob. You coming?

JACOB

Huh?   Oh, yeah.

MALEE

You know, your birthday's coming

up. Any hints as to what you might

like?

JACOB

Whatever you get me will be fine.

MALEE

(annoyed)

Right.

MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Are you okay?

JACOB

(lying)

Never better.
