Mr. Gazzo wants the two

hundred now!

FATS

Honest to God I'm broke --

Gimme a break.

ROCKY

Mr. Gazzo says I should get

two hundred or break the thumb.

FATS

Please, I need my hands to

work -- Christ, don't bust my

thumbs.

ROCKY

Goin' fishin'?

ROCKY

What's ya name again?

FATS

Bob.

ROCKY

Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,

Me, I ain't emotionally

involved.

ROCKY

(continuing; counting)

A hundred an' thirty.

FATS

That's it, I'm broke.

ROCKY

That's it? -- Completely?

FATS

That's it.

ROCKY

What about for food an' stuff?

7.

FATS

You have my food in ya hand.

ROCKY

... The juice is climbin'

every week.

FATS

I know the juice is climbin' --

I been workin' six months just

to pay the damn interest.

ROCKY

Ya still light seventy.

FATS

Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't

have to break nothin' -- Here,

take my coat, it's worth

fifty-sixty dollars.  It's

yours.

FATS

(continuing)

See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's

don't have to know nuthin'.

I'll go tape up the hand like

ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo

won't be wise to nothin' -- Be

a smart guy, keep the coat,

we'll fake like ya broke the

hand.

FATS

(almost a whisper)

No - no - no - Please -

Please - Please don't...

ROCKY

...That's what coulda happened.

(walks off.)

8.

ADRIAN

... Could you take the puppy

out --

CUSTOMER

It can breathe.

ADRIAN

Please -

CUSTOMER

Please, nothin' - I paid for

this dog and can do whatever I

want with it - I can throw it

through the window if I want -

Now give me my two dollars

back before I do throw it

through the window.

CUSTOMER

Get away from me - Give me that!

ROCKY

... How's the turtle food this

week?

9.

ADRIAN

... Fine.

ROCKY

Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

ADRIAN

... I'm sorry.

ROCKY

Ain't your fault - Here's the

problem.

ROCKY

The last food I got here had

more moths than flies -- An'

the moths get caught in my

turtle's throat -- That makes

them cough --

ROCKY

(continuing)

Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'

about the turtle food -- Like

I was sayin', the moths get

caught in the turtle's throat

an' makes 'em cough...

(coughs)

A little cough an' I gotta

smack 'em on the shell -- An'

whatta think they get?

ROCKY

(continuing)

I smack 'em hard on the shell

an' they get... What?

ADRIAN

... I don't know.

ROCKY

Shell-shocked!

10.

OWNER

Startin' with the bad jokes

early today, huh.

ROCKY

Inventin' jokes ain't easy.

ROCKY

(continuing)

How's Butkus this mornin'?

OWNER

Ain't had time to check 'em.

ROCKY

Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

ROCKY

...What kinda dog is this again?

OWNER

Bullmastiff.

ROCKY

The owner was suppose to pick

him up three weeks ago.

OWNER

We're not responsible for

animals left over thirty

days - We board it ain't a

animal shelter, Y'know.

...Adrian, I want you to clean

all those cat cages downstairs,

they're a mess.

(Adrian nods.)

11.

ROCKY

He only had a hundred an'

thirty. -- I think he's good

for the rest next week, Mr.

Gazzo.

GAZZO

(patiently)

Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for

it...

GAZZO

Tomorrow collect from Del

Rio -- He's late three weeks.

How'd you do last night?

ROCKY

... Fine.

BODYGUARD

Did ya get the license number?

ROCKY

Of wa?

BODYGUARD

... Of the truck that run over

your face.

GAZZO

Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job

this mornin?  How come ya

didn't break this guy's thumb

like I asked ya?  When ya

don't do what ya are told, it

makes me look bad, kid.

ROCKY

I figure if I break the thumb

this guy gets thrown outta his

job and can't pay nothin no

more.

12.

GAZZO

It don't matter.  It's my

reputation.  These guys think

they can get off light.  It's

bad for my reputation -- It's

bad for business.  See ya

killer.

GAZZO

(to Bodyguard)

... The Rock's a good kid.

BODYGUARD

(emotionless)

... A meatbag.

RUDY

...See the fight last night?

RUDY

Nah, I was fightin' myself.

RUDY

Apollo Creed beat the bum to

pieces.

13.

FIGHTER #1

Hey, hear ya knocked Spider

Rice out in the sixth?

ROCKY

The third -- Shoulda seen it.

FIGHTER #2

(removes glove)

Hey, Rock, touch my hand.

ROCKY

How come?

FIGHTER #2

C'mon, it's important.

FIGHTER #2

(continuing)

Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

ROCKY

(mumbling)

... These ain't my clothes.

14.

ROCKY

(continuing)

... These ain't my pictures.

ROCKY

Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'

here?

MIKE

It ain't your locker no more.

ROCKY

Whatta ya talkin' about it

ain't my locker no more?

MIKE

Listen, I'm with you -- But ya

gotta talk to Mickey -- I put

ya stuff in the bag over there.

FIGHTER

...Hey, Peanut, gimme some

soap, Man.

MIKE

(irate)

Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,

Nobody -- You don't call me

Peanut.

FIGHTER

Peanut, gimme some soap.

15.

ROCKY

You were ready to bite that

guy's face.

MIKE

Yeah -- See the fight last

night?  Apollo Creed beat that

English guy bad.

ROCKY

Creed's great.

MICKEY

I don't care what nobody says,

this bum Creed woulda never

made it in the Thirties --

ROCKY

Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

MICKEY

(monotoned)

... What?

ROCKY

I said, how ya feelin'?

MICKEY

(dryly)

Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?

ROCKY

(low)

Yeah.

16.

MICKEY

(spitting)

Then stand there an' wait till

I'm done -- Creed's good,

yeah, he's real fine but I

gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,

who's got the stuff it takes

to be a champ -- He's mean,

quick, an' big -- What more

d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...

(to Rocky)

Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

ROCKY

I was talkin' with ya man,

Mike. -- Hey, how come I been

put outta my locker?

MICKEY

Dipper needed it.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Dipper's a climber -- You're a

tomato.

ROCKY

... Tomato?

MICKEY

Facts is facts.  I run a

business here -- I'm cleanin'

house --

MICKEY

(continuing)

How old are ya?

ROCKY

...What?

MICKEY

How old?

ROCKY

Come July, twenty-five.

17.

MICKEY

More like thirty.

ROCKY

Twenty-five, thirty -- What's

the difference? -- It took me

two months to learn the

combination of that locker.

MICKEY

The legs must be goin'.

ROCKY

Yeah, they're goin', -- that's

nature... That was my locker

for six years.

MICKEY

... Did ya fight last night?

ROCKY

Yeah --

MICKEY

Did ya win?

ROCKY

Yeah, Kayo.

MICKEY

... Who'd ya fight?

ROCKY

Spider Rice.

MICKEY

Rice is a bum.

ROCKY

You think everybody I fight is

a bum.

MICKEY

Ain't they?

18.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Ya want the truth -- Ya got

heart, but ya fight like an

ape -- The only thing special

about you is ya never got ya

nose broke -- keep ya nose

pretty -- what's left of ya

brain an' retire.

ROCKY

Listen, I'm gonna take a

steam -- Did good last night --

Shoulda seen it.

MICKEY

Hey, ever think about retirin'?

ROCKY

...No.

MICKEY

Think about it.

ROCKY

Yeah, sure.

ROCKY

(continuing)

...I think I'm gonna take a

steam -- Shoulda seen me

fight -- Did good, y'know.

MICKEY

(gesturing

towards Rocky)

Known him since he was

fifteen -- A waste of life.

DIPPER

(to Rocky)

... I dig yo' locker, Man.

TRAINER

Time, Dipper.

19.

ROCKY

... Wow -- cold!  Good night

to catch pneumonia.

ROCKY

(continuing)

Ah -- I came in here for

somethin'... Oh, yeah, would

ya like somebody to walk ya

home?

ROCKY

(continuing)

Hey, how's my buddy doin'?

(looks into

Butkus' cage)

-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see

ya later.

ADRIAN

... Goodnight, Rocky.

20.

ROCKY

Catch pneumonia out there --

Seen Paulie?

ROCKY

Yo, Paulie.

PAULIE

(very drunk)

Yo, Rocky -- Look at this

mirror.  I'd like to kill the

friggin' moron who broke this

mirror.

ROCKY

Yo, Paulie.

PAULIE

What?

ROCKY

Your sister's givin' me the

shoulder.

PAULIE

Forget her.  You could do

better than my sister.

ROCKY

Every mornin', every night I

pass by -- I smile.

(MORE)

21.

ROCKY (CONT'D)

I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She

looks at me.

PAULIE

(annoyed)

Looks, huh?

ROCKY

Yeah, like I was a plate of

leftovers -- Somethin' wrong

with my face -- Whatta I need,

a Caddy to connect with ya

sister?

PAULIE

My sister's a friggin' loser.

ROCKY

Hey --

PAULIE

Sometimes she gets me so

crazy, I'd like to split her

head with a razor.

ROCKY

Don't get mental, man.

PAULIE

Ya caught me in a bad mood.

ROCKY

Ya always in a bad mood --

PAULIE

... Adrian ain't sharp.

PAULIE

(continuing)

She's a loser -- She don't

enjoy life -- She reads --

Brainy -- Pushin' thirty

friggin' years old!  She's

gonna die alone if she don't

wise up.

ROCKY

I'm thirty myself.

22.

PAULIE

An' you're dyin' alone, too.

ROCKY

I don't see no crowd around

you, neither.

PAULIE

(pointing at

the wall)

I wanna kill the friggin'

moron who broke the mirror.

ROCKY

Let's get outta this stink.

PAULIE

The girl's dryin' up!  She's

gotta live a little before her

body dries up!!  You're a pal,

Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to

her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'

tomorrow.

ROCKY

... Sure.

PAULIE

Tomorrow you come for some

bird, right?

ROCKY

Absolutely...

ANDY

That was alotta crap to go

through for a dinner invite.

23.

COMMENTATOR

How was the flight, Champ?

APOLLO

Very high an' very fast.

COMMENTATOR

Apollo, how would you rate

this last British challenger,

Henry Wilcoxson?

APOLLO

He was big, an' very nasty so

I destroyed him in a hurry --

Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac

Lee Green next month.

COMMENTATOR

You're referring to the much

publicized bicentennial fight?

APOLLO

That's right -- It's gonna be

the greatest sportin' event in

this country's history -- A

gala occurrence!

COMMENTATOR

Still to be held in

Philadelphia?

APOLLO

The Bicentennial Heavyweight

Championship of the World is

gonna be held in the only

place it can be held --

Philadelphia! -- the nation's

cradle -- January First -- the

first major event of our two

hundredth year.

COMMENTATOR

Where're you off to now?

24.

APOLLO

Me an' my wife are goin' home

'cause we miss our children

an' can't go no more time

without seein' them.

COMMENTATOR

Any quick advice for young

boxing hopefuls?

APOLLO

(looks straight

into the camera)

... Stay in school an' use

your brains, dig -- Be a

lawyer, be a doctor, carry a

leather briefcase an' forget

about sports!!  Sports can

only make ya grunt an' smell --

Be a thinker not a stinker!!

COMMENTATOR

Jerry Simpson at Kennedy

Airport with the Champion,

Apollo Creed.

ANDY

Nobody cares what's happenin'

in the world of sports

nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,

downhill -- Basketball,

downhill.  Football's goin',

too.  Bank on it.  Baseball

use to be America's best

sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like

squattin' through a great

double header, but now

baseball's all business.

ANDY

(continuing)

Where are the real fighters?

The pros.  Today we jig clowns.

25.

ROCKY

Clown.

ANDY

Yeah.

ROCKY

He took his best shot an'

became champ -- What shot did

you ever take?

ANDY

Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with

yourself?  Fine.  But me, I

gotta business here -- I don't

need to take no shot.

ANDY

(continuing; boldly)

Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,

I'll take a shot!

CHIPPED TOOTH

(aggressively)

Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

ROCKY

... No wine -- Bad for ya'

brain.

CHIPPED TOOTH

C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

ROCKY

No wine.

CHIPPED TOOTH

Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.

26.

ROCKY

Why?

CHIPPED TOOTH

(sarcastically)

'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme

a dollar.

ROCKY

No dollar.

CHIPPED TOOTH

Hey, give Rocky a dime.

YOUNG MAN #2

... How come?

CHIPPED TOOTH

So he can call all his friends.

ROCKY

(mildly embarrassed)

... That's an old one.

CHIPPED TOOTH

Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

ROCKY

Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya

brother know you're hangin'

out so late?

MARIE

... Screw you.

ROCKY

(awed)

What'd you say?

MARIE

... Screw you, yoyo.

ROCKY

Did these guys teach you to

talk dirty?  Huh?

27.

MARIE

Hey --

ROCKY

What?

MARIE

Stuff it, man!

ROCKY

(shakes her)

Don't you never say that --

(to the gang)

-- You guys talk like that in

front of a little girl -- You

guys are scum.

CHIPPED TOOTH

This is our place, dig!

ROCKY

Don't ya never come round this

girl -- Go home.

YOUNG MAN #2

This is our corner, man!  You

go, chump!

CHIPPED TOOTH

(backpedaling)

We'll kill you, man -- We

gotta gun.

ROCKY

Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent

ya face!

28.

ROCKY

How come ya wanna hang out

with those guys?  They teach

ya bad things.

MARIE

I like 'em.  If you don't you

can f--

ROCKY

Hey!  When I was your age,

there was only one girl who

talked like that in the whole

neighborhood.

MARIE

(bored)

... Yeah.

ROCKY

Make your teeth yella --

MARIE

I like yella teeth.

ROCKY

Makes your breath like garbage.

MARIE

Maybe I like garbage.

ROCKY

Nobody likes garbage --

Anyway, this girl with the

dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',

but the guys wouldn't take her

out for any serious datin'.

MARIE

Why?

ROCKY

'Cause that's the way guys

are -- They laugh when ya talk

dirty.  They think ya cute for

a while, but then ya getta

reputation an' watch out.

(MORE)

29.

ROCKY (CONT'D)

Nobody's ever gonna take ya

serious.  Ya get no respect...

I gotta use a bad word --

Whore.  You'll end up maybe

becomin' a whore.

MARIE

C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

ROCKY

That doesn't matter -- You

don't really have to be a

whore, just act like one an'

that's it.

MARIE

What?

ROCKY

Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty

years from now people will say

'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,

who was she?' 'She was that

little whore who hung out at

the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,

now I remember!'... See, they

don't remember you, they

remember the rep.

ROCKY

(points down

the block)

... That's your house, ain't it?

ROCKY

(continuing)

Listen, I hope ya don't --

30.

MARIE

I won't.

ROCKY

What was I gonna say?

MARIE

Ya hope I don't keep acting

like a whore or I'll turn into

one, right?

ROCKY

Ya, somethin' like that.

MARIE

Goodnight, Rocky.

ROCKY

'Night, Marie.

MARIE

... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

ROCKY

(walks off)

... Yeah, who're you to give

advice, Creepo.

LAWYER

Are the doctor's reports

confirmed?

JERGENS

Definitely --

(reading)

-- It says here, Mac Lee Green

has suffered a seriously

cracked third metacarpal in

his left hand.

31.

APOLLO

Damn.

JERGENS

I suppose we could cancel the

fight indefinitely if you are

set on fighting Green.

TRAINER

It ain't just Green, what

about the time Apollo's

invested --

JERGENS

I believe we can find a

solution.

APOLLO

Solution, nothin' -- What

about the Bicentennial fight.

LAWYER

Jergens, don't play games with

my client!  Apollo has already

done nearly a million dollars

worth of publicity --

TRAINER

Ten million's worth!

LAWYER

-- And has made contractual

obligations with over twenty

different organizations -- He

doesn't want to be embarrassed.

APOLLO

You best find me another

ranked contender an' I mean in

a flash, man!

JERGENS

(holding up

some notes)

I contacted Ernie Roman's

manager, he's fighting in

France the same week.

APOLLO

Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's

ranked fifth.

32.

JERGENS

Shaw's fighting in South

America -- Why not postpone

the bout until July Fourth?

LAWYER

Hell with Fourth of July, man!

Ten thousand things'll be

goin' down on the Fourth of

July! -- Apollo wants to be

first!

JERGENS

That may not be possible, Jimmy.

TRAINER

This man here is the Star,

dig -- Don't cause him to

breathe heavy -- Now what

'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?

JERGENS

Went to California and gained

fifty pounds -- and I called

every worthwhile contender,

but they say five weeks isn't

enough time to get in shape.

APOLLO

Shape, nothin' -- They're

afraid.  They know everybody

in the world's gonna see this

fight an' none of them gotta

prayer of beating me so

they're makin' excuses so they

don't have to be the chump

that's gonna be whipped in

front of the whole civilized

world!!

JERGENS

Apollo, I'm sure there's a way

to salvage this.

TRAINER

Nobody wants to be dissected

on the country's birthday.

33.

JERGENS

All I can counter with is that

I'm a goddamn good promoter --

I've promoted in every country

in the world -- and I've tried

to the best of my abilities.

Perhaps you're right, and no

one wants to be beat on the

country's birthday... I don't

know what else to say --

APOLLO

I do -- Maybe what this fight

needs is something new -- a

novelty.

TRAINER

You's the novelty, Champ!

APOLLO

Give my main man a raise!!

APOLLO

(continuing)

Now here's what's goin' down.

Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say

this but one time.  On January

first, the first day of the

Bicentennial I'm gonna fight

me a local poor underdog, dig?

A snow-white underdog.  An'

I'm gonna put his face on this

poster with me, hear?  An'

I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm

sentimental -- An' all the

people in the country all

sentimental, man, an' they'd

like nothin' better than me,

Apollo Creed, to let some

unknown get a shot at the

greatest title in the world on

this country's biggest birthday.

Now that's the way I see it

an' that's the way I want it!!

JERGENS

... It's very American.

APOLLO

No, man, it's very smart.

34.

ROCKY

Next Wednesday I grab a grand

from Snyder.  An' Thursday two

yards from Cappoli, okay?

GAZZO

No, two yards from Snyder, an'

a grand from Cappoli.

ROCKY

Ya sure?

GAZZO

Hey, screw ya brain on right.

Now, who's this girl you're

going out with tonight?

ROCKY

How'd you know?

GAZZO

(smiles)

You think I don't hear things?

ROCKY

Paulie's sister.

BODYGUARD

(abrasively)

Hear she's retarded.

ROCKY

(dryly)

She ain't retarded, she's shy.

BODYGUARD

Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards

like the zoo.

ROCKY

Does that bum have to say that?

35.

GAZZO

Buddy's in a bad mood --

prostate problems.

ROCKY

He's always in a bad mood.

(laughs)

Count ya blessin's.  Ya a

healthy person -- ya legs

work -- ya hands work --

BODYGUARD

I don't like ya face.

ROCKY

Don't like yours neither.

BODYGUARD

Kiss my ass.

ROCKY

Move your shoulders down.

GAZZO

(smiles)

Buddy's got a thing against

ya, Rock.  Some people just

hate for no reason, y'know.

ROCKY

Yeah.

GAZZO

Here's fifty bucks -- You an'

the girl have a nice time.

ROCKY

Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.

APOLLO

How 'bout this Billy Snow?

36.

JERGENS

Fouls.

APOLLO

How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?

TRAINER

Too old, dull fighter.

(points at a name)

Bobby Judge is a good boy.

APOLLO

... I don't feel heat from the

name.

JERGENS

Joe Zack is a good prospect --

Exciting boy.

APOLLO

... Still don't feel no heat.

JERGENS

(sighs)

Exactly what are you looking

for, Apollo?

APOLLO

... This man.

APOLLO

(continuing;

much amused)

'The Italian Stallion' -- He's

my man.

JERGENS

Rocky Balboa -- His record's

poor --

APOLLO

Don't matter -- That name.

'The Italian Stallion,' it's

right on.

(laughs)

Who discovered America?  An

Italian, right?  So, man, what

could be better than to get it

on with one of his ancestors --

TRAINER

He won't last one round.

37.

APOLLO

Listen, I gonna carry this boy

three rounds, then drop 'im

like a bad habit.

TRAINER

I don't like you messin' with

southpaws -- They do everything

wrong.

APOLLO

Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop

'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed

meets the Italian Stallion.'

Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn

monster movie!!

FADE OUT.

ROCKY

(mimes throwing)

I usta be deadly at half-ball.

PAULIE

I hate the friggin' game...

I'd like to talk some business.

ROCKY

What kinda business?

PAULIE

Look at my hands -- See how

the joints are swollen.

PAULIE

(continuing)

Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in

an' out of a freezer carryin'

meat plays hell on the joints.

ROCKY

Maybe ya should see a doctor.

38.

PAULIE

I don't need a doctor, I need

a different job.

ROCKY

Maybe another job is the best

thing.

PAULIE

Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.

Tell him I'm a friend an'

would do a good job... Tell

him I ain't bothered by

nothin' an' would be a great

collector... Bustin' bones

don't bother me -- Tell him

I'm a good worker.

ROCKY

Gazzo's gotta come to you.

PAULIE

I'm askin' ya to go to him --

As a favor.

ROCKY

Gazzo's gotta come to you --

Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --

Do what you do now.

PAULIE

You know her?

39.

ROCKY

Ya sister knows I'm comin'?

PAULIE

Yeah, sure -- She's very

excited.

ADRIAN

(weakly)

Paulie, you're late.

PAULIE

Did you call the hospital?

(to Rocky)

If I'm ten minutes late, she

calls the hospital.

COMMENTATOR (V.O.)

... Unfortunate luck for

fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac

Lee Green.  The slugging

fighter acquired a serious

fracture in his left hand

after an aggressive day of

sparring -- Champion Apollo

Creed says he'll be 'shopping

for another victim,' to fill

Green's vacancy for the

Bicentennial Championship

Fight to be held in Philly

next month... By the way,

rumor has it that this will be

the most widely-viewed sporting

event in the entire world --

and that includes the Super

Bowl, folks... Today U.S.

swimmers set a new...

40.

ADRIAN

... Paulie, why didn't you

tell me you were bringing him

home?!  Look at me, I'm not

ready for this.

PAULIE

Like it would make a difference

if you were, right?  This

guy's a friend and now he's

takin' ya out.

ADRIAN

No... I can't!

PAULIE

Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom

an' I don't wanna know from

nothin'.

ADRIAN

Paulie, please --

PAULIE

Hey, I want ya out

instamaticly. -- I'm sicka

lookin' at ya hangin' around

like a friggin' spider -- Go

out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life.

ADRIAN

... Like you?

PAULIE

Don't get wise with me.  I

want ya to stop bein' a loser.

ADRIAN

I can't go out.

PAULIE

Why?

ADRIAN

Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.

I've gotta turkey in the oven.

41.

PAULIE

!! Ya want the bird, go out in

the alley an' eat the bird --

I want ya outta the house --

Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya

hungry, Rock?

ROCKY

Maybe ya better forget it.

PAULIE

Forget nothin' -- Here, talk

to my sister, tell 'er

somethin' nice.

ROCKY

... Yo, Adrian, it's me,

Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's

kinda hard for me to think of

somethin' to say, y'know --

'Cause I never talked to a

door before, I mean whatta ya

say to a door.

ROCKY

(continuing)

... Maybe I better forget it.

PAULIE

Try again, c'mon, try again.

ROCKY

Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't

too happy at this moment, but

would ya do me a favor -- I

ain't got nobody to spend

Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout

you an' me goin' out -- Get

somethin' to eat, maybe laugh

a little, who knows... Would

ya like, I dunno, go out

together?

42.

ROCKY

(continuing)

We'll have a good time.

ROCKY

(continuing)

What's ya sister like to do?

PAULIE

Ice skate.

ROCKY

I didn't want no turkey anyway.

ADRIAN

It's Thanksgiving.

ROCKY

To you, to me it's Thursday.

ROCKY

Looks quiet, y'know.

ADRIAN

I think it's closed.

ROCKY

I think mebbe we're early or

somethin' --

CLEANER

Hey, whatta ya doin' here --

we're closed... Yo, we're

closed!

ROCKY

(yells back)

Are ya closed to the General

Public or to just everybody.

43.

CLEANER

(starts to walk over)

Hey, the rink is empty 'cause

we're closed -- ya ain't

allowed in here so do me a

favor an' not stay here.

ROCKY

Wait here, gotta smooth this

guy out.

ADRIAN

(softly)

We could go somewhere else

an' --

CLEANER

Yo, pal, what's with you --

The place ain't operatin'.

ROCKY

Listen, I gotta problem.  This

girl ain't feelin' well,

y'know -- The doctor says she

should exercise, y'know once

in awhile an' ice skatin' is

the best thing --

CLEANER

This a con?

ROCKY

Look at her, ya can see she

ain't feelin' good -- needs a

few minutes exercise --

CLEANER

Few minutes?

ROCKY

... Ten minutes.

CLEANER

Ten minutes for ten dollars.

ROCKY

... Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

44.

ADRIAN

... Aren't you skating?

ROCKY

Ain't skated since I was

fifteen -- That's when I

started fightin' -- gotta

watch the ankles.  Yeah,

fightin' use to be tops with

me, but no more.  All I wanted

to prove was I weren't no

bum -- That I had the stuff to

make a good pro.

ADRIAN

And you never got the chance?

CLEANER

Nine minutes!

ROCKY

Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still

fight.  Kinda do it like a

hobby.  See I'm a natural

southpaw an' most pugs won't

fight a southpaw 'cause we

mess up their timin' an' look

awkward -- Southpaw means

lefthanded... But I guess in

the long run things probably

worked out for the best, right?

ADRIAN

But you never had a chance to

prove yourself.

ROCKY

Absolutely.

CLEANER

Eight minutes!

ROCKY

I just dislocated my finger.

ADRIAN

Ohh!

CLEANER

Seven minutes!

45.

ROCKY

It ain't your fault -- I

originally done it in the Baby

Crenshaw fight.

(opens his wallet)

That's me fightin' Big Baby

Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the

size of an airplane an' I

broke my hands on his head --

I lost, but it's a nice

picture, don't ya think?

CLEANER

Six!

ROCKY

How 'bout some Cokes?

CLEANER

Cost ya a buck.

ROCKY

This guy is beautiful -- get

the Cokes.

ROCKY

(continuing)

See, I ain't graceful,

y'know -- I don't move good --

Stink as a dancer too -- But I

can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw

an' nobody wants to fight a

southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?

ROCKY

(continuing)

Y'know how I got started in

the fight racket?

ADRIAN

By accident?

CLEANER

Here -- Three minutes.

46.

ROCKY

Yeah -- My ol' man who was

never the sharpest told me --

I weren't born with much brain

so I better use my body.

ROCKY

(continuing)

What's funny?

ADRIAN

My mother told me just the

opposite.  She said, 'You

weren't born with much of a

body so you'd better develop

your brain.'

CLEANER

Time!

CLEANER

(continuing)

That's ten bucks.

ROCKY

I must be goin' deaf 'cause I

thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

CLEANER

(weakly)

... How 'bout for the Cokes?

ROCKY

Charge it.

ROCKY

(continuing)

Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?

47.

ROCKY

Some people are very shy by

nature.

ADRIAN

... I suppose.

ROCKY

I would say you're very shy bu

nature.

ADRIAN

... I suppose.

ROCKY

Some people think bein' shy is

a disease, but it don't bother

me.

ADRIAN

It doesn't bother me either.

ROCKY

Then why did I bother bringin'

it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,

that's why... Y'know, I think

we make a real sharp coupla

coconuts -- I'm dumb an'

you're shy.

ADRIAN

... It is just hard for me to

understand why anybody wants

to be a fighter.

ROCKY

Ya gotta be a little soft to

wanna be a pug... It's a

racket where ya' almost

guaranteed to end up a bum.

ADRIAN

I don't think you're a bum.

ROCKY

... I'm at least half a bum.

Yeah, fightin' is a crazy

racket.  The roughest part is

the mornin' after.

ADRIAN

Morning after?

48.

ROCKY

After a rough fight, ya'

nothin' but a large wound.

Sometimes I feel like callin'

a taxi to drive me from my bed

to the bathroom... Ya' eyes

hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair

even hurts... But the thing

I'm proud of is I been in over

sixty fights an' never had a

busted nose -- Bent an'

twisted an' bitten but never

broke... That's rare.

ADRIAN

Why do you do it if it hurts

so bad?

ROCKY

... Guess.

ADRIAN

(pause)

'Cause you can't sing or dance?

ROCKY

Would ya like a glass of water?

ADRIAN

... No thanks.

ROCKY

Here's the guys I was tellin'

ya about -- This is Cuff an'

Link.

ADRIAN

I sold them to you.

49.

ROCKY

(very embarrassed)

... Oh, yeah, I bought the

whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me

the turtles, the bowl, an' the

mountain -- I had to get rid

of the mountain 'cause they

kept fallin' off.

ADRIAN

Do you have a phone?

ROCKY

I had it pulled.  People

callin' all the time.  Who

needs it -- Who'd you wanna

call?

ADRIAN

I wanna let my brother know

where I am.

ROCKY

D'you really wanna call?

ADRIAN

Yes, I do.

ROCKY

You sure?

ADRIAN

Yes.

ROCKY

Why?

ADRIAN

I think he might be worried.

ROCKY

I'll call your brother.

ROCKY

(continuing)

!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's

with me!  I'll call ya later.

50.

ROCKY

(continuing)

What's the matter?  Ya don't

like the room?

ADRIAN

It's fine.

ROCKY

It's only temporary.

ADRIAN

It's not that --

ROCKY

What's the problem?  You don't

like me -- Don't like the

turtles -- What is it?

ADRIAN

I don't think I belong here.

ROCKY

It's okay.

ADRIAN

No, I don't belong here.

ROCKY

It's all right -- You're my

guest.

ADRIAN

... I've never been in a man's

apartment before.

ROCKY

(gesturing)

They're all the same.

ADRIAN

I'm not sure I know you well

enough -- I don't think I'm

comfortable.

ROCKY

Yo, I'm not comfortable either.

ADRIAN

(standing)

I should leave.

51.

ROCKY

But I'm willin' to make the

best of this uncomfortable

situation.

ROCKY

(continuing; softly)

Would ya take off your glasses?

ADRIAN

(dumbstruck)

What?

ROCKY

The glasses... Please.

ADRIAN

(timidly)

... T-thank you.

ROCKY

Do me another favor?

ADRIAN

... What?

ROCKY

Could ya take off that hat.

ROCKY

(continuing)

I always knew you was pretty.

ADRIAN

Don't tease me.

ROCKY

I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't

have to kiss me back if ya

don't feel like it.

52.

MIKE

Hey, Rock -- What happened?

ROCKY

'Bout what?

MICKEY

Did ya get the message, kid?

ROCKY

Message -- What message?

MICKEY

A Rep from Miles Jergens'

Promotions was lookin' for

ya -- They need sparrin'

partners for Creed.

ROCKY

Ya puttin' me on?

MICKEY

Here's the card?

ROCKY

When was they here?

53.

MICKEY

'Bout an hour ago.

ROCKY

Probably lookin' for sparrin'

partners.

MICKEY

... I said that before.

MICKEY

(continuing)

... Waste of life.

SECRETARY

May I help you?

SECRETARY

(continuing)

Your name, please?

ROCKY

Balboa, Rocky Balboa.

SECRETARY

You may go in.

54.

JERGENS

Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles

Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

ROCKY

... Thanks.

JERGENS

Mr. Balboa --

ROCKY

(overriding)

Rocky.

JERGENS

Rocky, do you have any

representation?  A manager?

ROCKY

No -- Just me.

JERGENS

Rocky, would you be interested

in --

ROCKY

Sparrin'?

JERGENS

Excuse me.

ROCKY

I know ya need sparrin'

partners -- I'm very available.

JERGENS

I'm sure you are.

ROCKY

Absolutely -- Sparrin' with

the Champ would be an honor --

y'know what?

JERGENS

What?

ROCKY

I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

I'd be a good sparrin' partner.

55.

JERGENS

Rocky, would you be interested

in fighting Apollo Creed for

the Championship?

ROCKY

... Like I said, I'd make a

boss sparrin' mate.

JERGENS

Did you hear what I said?

ROCKY

Sure, an' I'm smart enough to

know that no sparrin' partner

should take cheap shots at the

Champ.  He's just there to

help condition the man.

JERGENS

Not spar, I'm asking whether

you would be interested in

fighting Creed for the

championship.

ROCKY

... Ah... Absolutely.

REPORTER #1

How'd you like the 'City of

Brotherly Love?'

APOLLO

I like my Philadelphia Brothers.

An' I'm patriotic!

56.

APOLLO

(continuing;

mock seriousness)

If yo' don't back up I'm gonna

send yo' home with a microphone

in yo' nose!

REPORTER #2

Why did you agree to fight a

man who has virtually no

chance of winning?

APOLLO

If history proves one thing,

everybody gotta chance --

Didn't yo' all ever hear of

David an' Goliath? -- 'Course

I woulda knocked out Goliath.

REPORTER #3

It is a coincidence that

you're fighting a white man on

the most celebrated day in the

country's history?

APOLLO

The same coincidence that he's

fightin' a black man.

REPORTER #1

What're your feelings about

the challenger?

APOLLO

He's Italian.

REPORTER #1

What does that mean?

APOLLO

It means if he can't fight, I

bet he can cook!

PAULIE

Do me a favor -- His lungs,

punch 'em out.

ADRIAN

Paul.

57.

REPORTER #2

This is your largest payday

ever -- How do you feel about

it?

ROCKY

Feel?  I dunno... Happy.

REPORTER #2

How will you fight Apollo Creed?

ROCKY

(mind elsewhere)

Creed's great, ain't he...

I'll do what I can.

REPORTER #1

Where did you get the name,

'Italian Stallion?'

ROCKY

I thought of it 'bout eight

years ago, when I was eatin'

dinner.

REPORTER #2

Is it true the most you've

ever made in a prizefight is

five hundred dollars?

ROCKY

Four hundred -- But that was a

long time ago.

REPORTER #2

And now your payday will be

one hundred and fifty thousand

dollars.  Any comment?

ROCKY

Listen, I wanna say hi to my

girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!

ADRIAN

Oh, Rocky!

PAULIE

(dry)

Christ.

58.

ADRIAN

You didn't!

ROCKY

Sure I did.  You heard.

COMMENTATOR

A Bicentennial Fight --

January first.  It will be the

first sporting event on our

two hundredth birthday and is

already being called by many

the greatest farce in sports

history.  If this man lasts

more than a minute I would say

he's on borrowed time.

(sarcastically)

It's matches like this with

their exorbitant prices that

give sports a bad name -- Not

only is this match bad,

people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky

Balboa?  At the State Athletic

Commission, Larry Duggan

reporting.

PAULIE

(irate)

The guy's a friggin' moron.

ROCKY

Why?

PAULIE

Don't it matter none he's

makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd

break his lips.

ROCKY

It don't matter.

PAULIE

He's takin' cheap shots.

ROCKY

It don't bother me none.

PAULIE

Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be

lookin' for people to help,

right?

59.

ROCKY

Help what?

PAULIE

Y'know, to help keep ya livin'

clean.

ROCKY

I'll do okay.

PAULIE

Ya gotta have a guy help ya

exercise, mebbe somebody to be

standin' by with a towel or

run errands, y'know.

ROCKY

Hey, who cared about me

yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I

think I'm gonna train myself.

PAULIE

Without havin' good people

around, ya won't have such a

good chance.

ADRIAN

Einstein flunked out of

school... twice.

PAULIE

That so.

ADRIAN

Roosevelt finished last in his

class -- Beethoven was deaf,

an' Helen Keller was blind --

I think Rocky has a good chance.

ROCKY

See ya tomorrow.

60.

ROCKY

(continuing)

How'd ya like hearin' ya name

on TV?

ADRIAN

I don't know -- I was shocked.

Why did you do that?

ROCKY

Ya puttin' me on, right?

ADRIAN

(smiles)

Absolutely -- What time should

I expect you?

ROCKY

'Bout seven.

ADRIAN

I'll be waiting.

ROCKY

Y'know how I said that stuff

on television didn't bother me?

ADRIAN

Yes.

ROCKY

It did.

ROCKY

Y'know I won't be able to work

for ya no more.

GAZZO

Hey -- if a good man can make

a better life, let him make it.

ROCKY

I feel bad about walkin'.

61.

GAZZO

Take your shot, kid -- You got

money for trainin' expenses?

ROCKY

A few bucks.

GAZZO

Here's five hundred -- Put it

in your glove.

ROCKY

Do I have to pay juice?

GAZZO

(smiles)

Does Santa Claus charge juice?

Merry Christmas -- Now, how's

about my present, ya gonna win?

ROCKY

Gonna try.

GAZZO

Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya

know, I'm with ya -- Italian,

we're blood.  You kill this

rug -- We Guinneas gotta show

these Afro-Americans where

it's at.  Give it your best

shot cause I want ya to prove

to these bums on the corner

that my man can't be beat by

this rug... Ya got any action

on the side.

ROCKY

No action.

GAZZO

Ya gettin 150 grand killer.

Ya got any plans for it?

Whatta ya think?

(MORE)

62.

GAZZO (CONT'D)

Ya like to put it on the

street, make it work for ya?

ROCKY

I'm gonna do somethin with it.

GAZZO

Sure, you do what ya want.

Stay away from the stock market.

ROCKY

Black market?

GAZZO

Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,

remember when we was kids, we

fought together.  An' I wasn't

well an' ya had to beat up

that Irish kid -- what's his

name? -- Gallager -- I bought

a suit and became a businessman.

You put on gloves.  An' I

remember Mama almost cried,

may she rest in peace -- an'

our ol' man who said ya had no

brains -- I'd like to lay

hands on that bastard.  You

ain't never had any luck.

Even when I owned you in '66

you never had luck.  But now I

think you might be gettin'

some luck kid.  Whatta you

think?

ROCKY

Yo, you gonna show, Tony?

GAZZO

Where else am I gonna go.

(to Bodyguard)

Bet three grand on Rocky.

BODYGUARD

He's a bum -- are you kiddin?

GAZZO

(slaps Bodyguard)

No!  I'm not kiddin!

63.

ROCKY

Look who's home!

MICKEY

(stiffly)

I seen the light.  I figure

somebody was home.

ROCKY

Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'

here?  Here, sit down.

ROCKY

(continuing)

Best seat in the house -- Hey,

Mick, this is too much.

MICKEY

How do you mean?

ROCKY

I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,

but seein' ya here, in my

house, it's kinda outta joint.

MICKEY

Listen, Rock, you're a very

lucky guy.

ROCKY

Yeah.

64.

MICKEY

What's happened is freak luck.

ROCKY

Freak luck for sure.

MICKEY

Look at all them other fighters.

Real good boys.  Good records.

Colorful.  Fight their hearts

out for peanuts -- But who

cared?  Nobody.  They got it

shoved in their back door.

Nobody ever give them a shot

at the title...

ROCKY

(uneasy)

Freak luck is a strange thing.

MICKEY

Whatta' those?

ROCKY

Turtles -- domestic turtles.

MICKEY

(businesslike)

I'm here tellin' ya to be very

smart with this shot.  Like

the Bible sez, ya don't get no

second chance.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Ya need a manager.  An advisor.

I been in the racket fifty

years.  I done it all, there

ain't nothin' about the world

of pugilism that ain't livin'

up here.

ROCKY

(at a loss)

Fifty years, huh.

65.

MICKEY

(stronger)

Fifty years.  The rep is known

around Philly, an' a good rep

can't be bought, but I don't

have to tell you that.

ROCKY

How 'bout a glass of water?

MICKEY

Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

ROCKY

(uneasy)

... What?

MICKEY

(driving each

word hard)

I done it all.  I've done an'

seen everything'.  Believe

what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya

shoulda seen the night in

Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'

Russo outta the ring, September

14, 1923 -- same night Firpo

knocked Dempsey outta the ring.

But who got the Press?  He did.

He had a manager -- September

14, 1923.

ROCKY

(softly)

Ya got a good mind for dates.

MICKEY

Look at this face -- twenty-

one stitches over the left

eye, thirty-four over the

right -- my nose was busted

seventeen times, the last

being the Sailor Mike fight

New Year's Eve, 1940, in

Camden, New Jersey -- What a

professional pastin' I give

him.  Here, read about it.

(MORE)

66.

MICKEY (CONT'D)

(shows a tiny

press clipping;

points to

cauliflower ear)

An' he give me the vegetable

on the ear.  I got pain an'

experience... an' you got

heart -- kinda remind me of

Marciano, ya do.

ROCKY

Nobody ever said that --

There's his picture.

MICKEY

Yeah, ya kinda remind me of

the Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

ROCKY

Really think so?

MICKEY

Ya got heart.

ROCKY

Heart, but I ain't got no

Tocker.

MICKEY

Christ, I know this business.

Rocky, when I was fightin' it

was the dirtiest racket goin',

see.  Pugs like me was treated

like fightin' dogs -- throw ya

in the pit an' for ten bucks

ya try to kill each other.  We

had no management...

(MORE)

67.

MICKEY (CONT'D)

fought in boxcars, in

whorehouse basements, any

joint with a floor -- October

1931 I fought a bum who put a

tack in the thumb of his glove

an' punched so many holes in

my face I had spit shootin'

outta my cheeks -- I never had

no manager watchin' out for

me -- See that picture outside

the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'

that's me in my prime.  I had

all the tools.  I coulda

starched any lightweight husky

on the East Coast -- But I had

no management.  Nobody ever

got to know how slick I was,

but I had a head for business

an' stashed a few bucks an'

opened the gym -- It's a dirt

hole, I know it, but that an'

a lotta scars is what I got to

show for fifty years in the

business, kid -- now you come

along with this shot an' I

feel like it's me gettin' the

shot I never got... Yeah, we

was treated like dogs -- like

them Dago's, no offense, in

the Colosseum in Rome there --

An' now I got all this

knowledge, I wanna give it to

ya so I can protect ya an'

make sure ya get the best deal

ya can!

MICKEY

(continuing)

Respect, I always dished ya

respect.

ROCKY

... Ya gave Dipper my locker.

MICKEY

(almost begging)

I'm sorry, I -- I made a

mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man

to man.  I wanna be ya manager.

68.

ROCKY

The fight's set -- I don't

need a manager.

MICKEY

Look, you can't buy what I

know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it

all!  I got pain an' I got

experience.

ROCKY

I got pain an' experience too.

MICKEY

Please, kid.

ROCKY

(tightly)

Whatever I got, I always got

on the slide.  This shot's no

different.  I didn't earn

nothin' -- I got it on the

slide... I needed ya help

about ten years ago when I was

startin', but ya never helped

me none.

MICKEY

If ya was wantin' my help, why

didn't ya ask?  Just ask.

ROCKY

I asked, but ya never helped

nothin'! -- Like the Bible

sez, ya don't get no second

chance.

MICKEY

(yells)

Rocky, I'm seventy-six years

old.  Maybe you can be the

winner I never was -- your

shot is my last shot!

69.

70.

PAULIE

How ya feelin'?

ROCKY

(panting)

... Tight.

PAULIE

I got whiskey here.

ROCKY

... No.

PAULIE

This is the guy who's fightin'

Apollo Creed.

JOSE

(heavy accent)

Good luck -- Kill him, man.

PAULIE

(as though

rehearsed badly)

Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --

Hip -- Hip --

71.

JOSE

(walks away)

Hooray, man.

PAULIE

Rock'll be comin' by every

mornin' to pick up some

Prime -- can't train on that

store crap.

PAULIE

(teasing)

If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end

up hangin' on the hook, right?

ROCKY

Gazzo's a good man.

PAULIE

How 'bout you talk to 'em

about me?

(tightly)

Please do me that favor.

ROCKY

Keep this job, ya eat better.

PAULIE

Y'know, d'ya think you an' my

sister -- Ah, doin' good

together?

ROCKY

Whatta you think?

PAULIE

Ain't sure, what's the story?

ROCKY

What?

72.

PAULIE

The story -- what's happenin'?

PAULIE

(continuing)

Ya really like her?

ROCKY

Sure I like her.

PAULIE

(nervous laughter)

What's the attraction?  I

don't see it?

ROCKY

I dunno -- she fills gaps.

PAULIE

What gaps?

ROCKY

(shrugs and

takes meat)

She got gaps.  I got gaps --

together we fill the gaps.

PAULIE

(sharply)

You ballin' her?

ROCKY

(turns around)

Don't talk dirty 'bout ya

sister.

PAULIE

(tersely)

C'mon, ya screwin' her?

ROCKY

That's why I can't put ya

together with Gazzo, cause ya

talk too much -- big mouth.

73.

PAULIE

Hit the rump.  The rump!

Ya'll break the ribs!

PAULIE

(continuing)

We do that to Creed an'

they'll take us to jail for

murder.

ROCKY

Don't talk dirty 'bout ya

sister.

74.

MICKEY

(passionate)

Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!

It's clumsy.  You're off

balance.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Tie it to both ankles -- Leave

two feet slack.

ROCKY

I never had good footwork.

MICKEY

Forget the footwork -- You're

off balance.  The legs are

sticking everywhere.  Marciano

had the same problem, an' the

string cured it.  When you can

hit and move without breakin'

the string you'll have balance.

MIKE

You'll be a very dangerous

person.

BOY

Rocky, could we have your

autograph?

ROCKY

... Sure.

MICKEY

(irate)

Don't you boys ever interrupt

when I'm conductin' business,

or I'll kill you both -- Go

away.

75.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Autographs!  Ya wanna be a

writer or a fighter?  Let's

work.

MIKE

... we got visitors.

MICKEY

(approaching)

Can I help you guys?

REPORTER

(to Cameraman)

Set the camera up over there.

(to Mickey)

We're from Channel Seven --

Covering the pre-fight training.

MICKEY

I own the place.

CAMERAMAN

Rolling here.

SOUND MAN

Speed here.

REPORTER

(to the camera)

We're here at Goldmill's

Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark

of sorts since 1929 -- The

stench of toil permeates every

corner.  The sweat a trademark

of a unique profession... Yet,

the most unique fixture is an

unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog

heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

76.

ROCKY

(to Mickey)

Should I do this?

REPORTER

So much has happened lately --

Has it changed your life style

much?

ROCKY

... People talk to me more.

REPORTER

How're you preparing for this

Bicentennial bout?

FIGHTER

Readin' fuckin' history books,

man!

REPORTER

(flushed)

We can cut that out later.

Apollo Creed says he'll let

you stay three rounds before

he puts you away.

ROCKY

(honestly)

Apollo's a great fighter.

REPORTER

Do you feel you have a chance?

ROCKY

Maybe --

ROCKY

(continuing)

I'll tear his head off.

REPORTER

Do you have anything derogatory

to say about the Champion?

77.

ROCKY

Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

APOLLO

(bellowing)

I am the Champion of the whole

world!!!

APOLLO

(continuing)

(approaching Rocky)

Italian Stallion, I come over

to tell you to be very smart

an' after this fight donate

body to science, cause after

this fight what's left won't

fill a tuna fish can!... So

APOLLO

(continuing)

This classic fight -- Tha's

fight's goin' down in the

history books 'cause January

man to bounce another man offa

the planet Pluto!

APOLLO

(continuing)

Now I gots a special

announcement, y'hear.  For the

first time in alotta years

this championship fight is

Free -- 'Course that's just

the city...

(MORE)

78.

APOLLO (CONT'D)

Now some ya'll ain't much on

likin' me, but ya gotta admit

Apollo Creed is one DAMN

generous, 100% pure, government

inspected, Afro-American Folk

Hero!!!

DIPPER

(loud)

Ya nothin', Boy!

DIPPER

(continuing)

I say ya nothin'!

MICKEY

What's happenin' here?

DIPPER

I'm happenin'!  This pig is

takin' my shot -- I iz a

contender.  He's nothin'.

ROCKY

(dumbstruck)

Yo', Dipper, why're ya --

DIPPER

(shaking his fist)

Spar me in front of these here

TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to

Jersey!

MICKEY

(to Dipper)

You can forget about sparring,

kid.

DIPPER

Yo' know I iz the best man

here!  Yo' said so yoself!

79.

MICKEY

(almost

apologetically

to the crew)

Why let Rocky here take a

chance on cuttin' or breakin'

a hand? -- Take a shower,

Dipper.

DIPPER

Don't mouth me, old man, I'll

knock yo' out too.  C'mon,

wop, spar me, let everybody

see who's got the heat around

here.

DIPPER

(continuing; insanely)

Man, yo' best keep them

cameras out!  Fight me, boy!

Let Creed here see the kind of

punk he's fightin'!

MIKE

Don't chance it, man -- He's

sick.

MICKEY

This is gettin' outta hand --

Rocky will fight in the ring

January first, not here!

DIPPER

Yo' yellow, old man.

MICKEY

Not yellow, cautious.

(to the crew)

See, it's very easy for a

fighter to accidentally hurt --

80.

DIPPER

If yo're afraid to fight me,

then get down an' kiss my

feet, boy.

MICKEY

(softly)

Let's take a walk, Rock.

Please, don't take a chance.

He wants to hurt you so you

can't fight.

MIKE

Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!

Back off, scumbag, or I'll

bite your face!

DIPPER

... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

DIPPER

(continuing;

almost in a whisper)

... Kiss 'em.

81.

MICKEY

The kid's got cannons -- Print

that.

ADRIAN

Don't you open them anymore?

ROCKY

They either say, 'Kill the

nigger' or 'Hope you die,

Honky.' -- What ya got in the

bag?

ADRIAN

Like?

ROCKY

Sharp -- Real nice.

ADRIAN

Really -- You don't think

they're overly feminine?

ROCKY

No... Sharp -- You look great.

ROCKY

Adrian, you really look great,

y'know -- But I can't fool

around durin' trainin' --

makes the legs weak.

ADRIAN

Don't want weak legs.

82.

ROCKY

Can't fool around -- You look

very great.

ADRIAN

-- The legs.

ROCKY

Yeah... But I think weak legs

ain't bad sometimes, y'know.

ADRIAN

I thought it might be cute.

ROCKY

Ya right --

(laughs)

Mebbe we best just hold

hands -- the shirt made me

feel guilty, y'know.

83.

PAULIE

Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone

calls an' thanks to me ya

goin' to be a big man --

Thatta dog?

ROCKY

Whatta these guys want?

PAULIE

To see ya train.

ROCKY

Yo, what's with you? -- It was

suppose to be private.

PAULIE

I thought I was doin' ya a

favor -- C'mon inside --

Y'know, my sister really likes

ya.

COMMENTATOR

Just relax, Mr. Balboa --

(to the camera)

Today we're here with

heavyweight challenger, Rocky

Balboa.  The reason we are

standing in a refrigerated box

is that Mr. Balboa has an

unusual method of training and

in a moment he is going to

demonstrate it for our viewing

audience -- But first, Rocky,

how did you ever come to train

in an icebox?

ROCKY

Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me

in one day an' I hit the beef

here an' liked it -- An' since

I become a challenger, the

owner don't mind neither.

84.

COMMENTATOR

Is this a common training

method -- I mean do other

fighters pound raw meat?

ROCKY

I think me and Paulie invented

it.

COMMENTATOR

Would you give us a

demonstration?

COMMENTATOR

... Diane Lewis in the

meathouse with the Southpaw,

Rocky Balboa.

APOLLO

How much is being channeled

into West Coast closed-circuit

advertising?

LAWYER

Three hundred thousand.

APOLLO

Make it four hundred an' fifty.

(to younger man)

Send two hundred roses to the

mayor's wife from me, get a

picture an' make sure it gets

all the papers.

BUSINESSMAN #3

Do ya want to run the fifteen

radio spots in the mid-west?

I think you could spend the

money better in Canadian

publicity.

85.

APOLLO

Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --

see, if we can get a tax

break -- Gimme the figures on

the Program Concession.

TRAINER

(worried)

Apollo, you oughta come see

this boy you're gonna fight on

TV -- looks like he means

business.

APOLLO

I mean business, too --

(to men)

The gross rental of the arena

is gonna include the four

hundred ushers, right? --

Gimme some coffee.

ADRIAN

... And he called the

reporters --

ROCKY

Yeah... Threw my whole day off.

86.

ADRIAN

Don't be mad at him -- He just

wants to help.

ROCKY

Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just

outta joint when reporters are

around -- They take cheap

shots an' Paulie knows it.

ADRIAN

... Are you going to say

anything to him?

ROCKY

... What's to say?  I dunno

what he wants from me --

PAULIE

Nothin'!  I want nothin' from

you!!!

ADRIAN

Paulie!

PAULIE

Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I

ain't no charity case!  Get

outta my house!

ADRIAN

It's not your house --

PAULIE

You ain't no friend no more --

Go home!  Outta my house I

want ya!

ADRIAN

Don't talk like that to him!

PAULIE

Get outta my life both of ya's.

PAULIE

(continuing)

Outta my house I want ya!!

87.

ROCKY

... It's cold outside, Paulie.

PAULIE

I don't want ya messin' up my

sister no more -- He's scum

from the corner, I don't raise

ya to hang with no bum!

PAULIE

(continuing;

raising the bat)

... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --

C'mon, I'll break both ya arms

so's they never work...

ADRIAN

... Paulie.  Stop now!

PAULIE

I want 'im outta here --

(to Rocky)

Don't think I'm good enough to

work for Gazzo?

(spits)

That's what I think of bums

like you an' Gazzo!

(spits again)

You're goin' up an' don't care

enough to throw Paulie some

crumbs!

(spits)

I give ya meat, an' I give ya

my sister, too!

ADRIAN

Only a pig would say that!

PAULIE

(to Adrian)

You forget what I went through

to give ya the best.

88.

ADRIAN

You gave me what?!  Knots!

You gave me knots in here

every day -- you made me

scared of everything!

PAULIE

I always seen ya had the best,

but did ya ever think of

puttin' in a good word for me

with this scumbag!

ADRIAN

Don't do that again!

PAULIE

Get away from me -- I could

never even get married 'cause

you couldn't live by yaself --

ya'd die by yaself!  So

instead I put you two

together -- Did ya think of

puttin' in a good word for

me? -- You owe me!

ADRIAN

Owe you what?

PAULIE

You owe me an' are supposed to

treat me good!

ADRIAN

Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've

been treatin' you like a baby.

Since I can't remember it's so

long -- I'm the only one who

feeds you an' puts you in bed

when ya can't stand up -- and

it's you that made me feel

like a loser -- That's what ya

use to call me 'Loser' -- What

kind of name is that?  So can

ya blame me for not remembering

to talk about you when I'm

with Rocky -- I don't owe you,

Paulie, you owe me.

PAULIE

You busted?!

89.

ADRIAN

What?!

PAULIE

You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in

ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya

pulled down ya pants an' let

him have it, didn't ya!!

ROCKY

(fuming)

Hey --

PAULIE

(softly)

... I can't haul meat no more.

ROCKY

What can I do about it?

PAULIE

Christ, I been beggin' ya for

a break until I'm sick inside.

ROCKY

What break?  Huh?  What break!

Who am I to give breaks!  I'm

a fighter, you haul meat.  You

do what you do an' I do what I

do best -- that's it -- that's

life, man!

ROCKY

(continuing)

... An' what ya said to my

girlfriend ain't right -- Do

it again, I'll kill ya.

ROCKY

(continuing)

Wanna hear a dirty joke?

90.

ADRIAN

(smiles)

... Yes --

MICKEY

His defense is great, can't

lie 'bout that -- You have a

rollin' style.  Can't retreat

as fast -- But your style

ain't retreatin'.

MICKEY

(continuing)

See how he plays sometimes --

Drives his cornermen nuts.

Nobody knows his next move --

Him included.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Killer instinct -- Ya both got

the killer touch.  Interestin'.

See that! -- Right-cross

combination.  Beautiful.  But

you got the power to rip the

body.

MICKEY

(continuing)

Rocky, when ya climb into the

square, an' know ya' meetin'

the best fighter in the world,

ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna

be ready 'cause I been waitin'

for fifty years -- Fifty years.

When I'm done with you, you'll

gonna be able to spit nails.

(MORE)

91.

MICKEY (CONT'D)

You'll gonna be able to eat

lightin' and crap thunder --

You'll be a very, very

dangerous person...

MICKEY

What cha say, Benny -- Meet

'The Rock.' This is our

cutman, Benny Stein.

ROCKY

Yo, Benny.

MICKEY

Check the eyes, Ben.

92.

BENNY

Ain't bad.  Seen worse --

Cover up an' things should be

okay.

MICKEY

Take a shower.

PAULIE

Yo, Rock, I think I found an

angle to make some bread usin'

ya name, ya mind?

MAYOR

Sit down, Rocky.

93.

MAYOR

(continuing)

I've been going over your

record -- You've been the busy

type --

(reading)

Nineteen arrests -- probation

three times -- expelled from

seven public schools in 1964

and '65.

MAYOR

(continuing)

I'm a very busy man, but I

just wanted to remind you that

you'll be setting an example

for thousands of guys like

yourself and maybe start them

off in a new direction and

give our police force a

break -- I also hope you try

your very best and bring pride

to Philadelphia.

ROCKY

... I'll try.

MAYOR

Would you stand up, please.

MAYOR

(continuing)

Thank you for coming by,

Rocky -- good luck.

ROCKY

(turns)

Any time.

MAYOR

(sitting)

Wait... After the fight you'll

have nearly a hundred and

fifty thousand dollars -- What

do you plan to do with it?

94.

ROCKY

(smiles)

... Run for mayor.

ADRIAN

Rocky, do you realize everybody

in this country knows your

face, and after the fight

everybody in the world is

going to.

ROCKY

Yeah...

ROCKY

(continuing)

My first call... Hello?  Yeah,

speakin' -- Who is this?

Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,

Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't

seen ya for nine or eight

years -- Yeah, things is

great, how's things with you

upstate -- Ya sellin' real

estate, hey, that's a good

job... Yeah, I gotta advance,

but I bought ringside seats

for the guys at the gym.  I

get the hundred an' fifty

grand after the fight...

95.

ROCKY

(continuing)

... Yeah, I know it's a lotta

money -- Condominiums?  Nobody

uses them anybody.  Listen, I

think a pet shop is a good

investment, y'know -- I don't

care 'bout long hours --

there's no depreciation --

that don't matter none to

me -- Yeah, I like animals.

Why don't ya give me ya number

ROCKY

(continuing)

Okay, what is it -- four-

twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,

thanks for callin' -- Sure

I'll get back to ya, Bruce --

ADRIAN

What was that you said about a

pet shop?

ROCKY

(distant)

... What?

ADRIAN

What did you say about a pet

shop?

ROCKY

I don't want ya cleanin'

nobody else's cages no more.

ADRIAN

Is everything all right?

ROCKY

I gotta go out for a while.

ROCKY

(continuing; to dog)

... Come.

96.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

97.

MICKEY

... I know what you're

thinkin'm kid -- At least ya

gotta shot -- All ya can do is

try ya' best.

ROCKY

... Can't do it.

ADRIAN

... What?

ROCKY

... I can't beat him.

ADRIAN

Apollo?

ROCKY

Yeah, I can't beat him.

ROCKY

I been watchin' the movies --

studyin' -- He ain't weak

nowhere.

ADRIAN

What're we going to do?

ROCKY

... I dunno.

98.

ADRIAN

Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

ROCKY

It ain't so bad, 'cause I was

a nothin' before --

ADRIAN

Don't say that.

ROCKY

C'mon, it's true -- But that

don't bother me -- I just

wanna prove somethin' -- I

ain't no bum... It don't

matter if I lose... Don't

matter if he opens my head...

The only thing I wanna do is

go the distance -- That's all.

Nobody's ever gone fifteen

rounds with Creed.  If I go

them fifteen rounds, an' that

bell rings an' I'm still

standin', I'm gonna know then

I weren't just another bum

from the neighborhood...

ROCKY

(continuing)

... No foolin' around.

99.

100.

MICKEY

... It's time, kid.

ADRIAN

... I'll wait for you here.

ROCKY

Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?

"THE ITALIAN STALLION"

*Pennzoil*

MICKEY

Don't you care what the people

will say?

ROCKY

... I'm doin' it for a friend.

101.

MICKEY

Whatta you get outta this?

ROCKY

I get the robe an' Paulie gets

three grand.

MICKEY

... Shrewd.

COMMENTATOR #1

We would like to welcome our

viewing audience to the Grand

World Championship Bicentennial

Heavyweight Fight -- the first

major event of the Bicentennial

Year... A point of interest is

that the fight is being beamed

to more than seven hundred and

fifty million fans in theatres

in nearly every corner of the

world.  I would like to

welcome an old friend, and co-

commentator for this evening's

event -- Jimmy Michaels.

COMMENTATOR #2

Thank you, Bob.  The

electricity is everywhere

tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a

fifty-to-one underdog, is

living a Cinderella story

which has captured peoples'

imaginations all over the

world -- to quote a popular

sports magazine, 'The fighting

style should be 'The Caveman

Against the Cavalier.' From

the increase in sound it

appears the challenger is now

approaching the ring... His

record is forty-four wins,

twenty losses and thirty-eight

knockouts.

COMMENTATOR #1

I only wonder if this man has

the skill to go past three

rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'

102.

COMMENTATOR #2

You could go deaf with the

noise -- it undoubtedly means

Champion Apollo Creed is

heading towards the ring --

COMMENTATOR #1

Am I seeing right?  Creed is

approaching the ring in a boat.

Is he supposed to be George

Washington?  Obviously so.

COMMENTATOR #2

It's been confirmed that it is

definitely an impersonation of

George Washington -- a great

way to start 1976 off.

COMMENTATOR #1

I agree.

APOLLO

I want you!  I want you!

MICKEY

Don't let 'im get you tight.

103.

ROCKY

Whatta ya think that outfit

cost?

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen --

Welcome to the Bicentennial

Heavyweight Championship

Fight... We are very proud to

have with us four former Great

Champions... Ladies an' gents,

'The one and only 'Manassa

Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'

DEMPSEY

Good luck, kid.

ROCKY

(to Mickey)

Christ, Jack Dempsey.

ANNOUNCER

Former Middleweight Champion --

'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake

LaMotta!

ANNOUNCER

(continuing)

The man with the big punch --

Everybody's favorite, 'The

Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!

104.

ROCKY

They must be friends.

ANNOUNCER

Now, last but certainly not

least -- the former Heavyweight

Champion, a son of Philly,

Smoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER

Save some of him for me.

COMMENTATOR #1

The former champ looks great --

Can we get Joe over here --

here he comes.

COMMENTATOR #1

(continuing)

Joe, what are your feelings

about tonight's fight?

FRAZIER

Well, I think any man who

works an' trains hard always

gotta chance.

COMMENTATOR #2

You look in great shape, Joe.

FRAZIER

I'm always in shape.

105.

ANNOUNCER

... Now for the evening's main

event -- In the corner to my

right, The Challenger, wearing

white trunks -- At one hundred

an' ninety-one pounds, one of

Philly's own sons -- 'The

Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!

ANNOUNCER

In the far corner, wearing

red, white an' blue -- Weighing

in at two hundred and ten

pounds -- Undefeated in forty-

six fights -- the Heavyweight

Champion of the World -- 'The

Master of Disaster' -- Apollo

Creed!

REFEREE

... Now come out fighting.

MICKEY

God bless ya, Rock.

ROCKY

Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

106.

COMMENTATOR #1

The Champ stings the slower

challenger with jabs at

will -- Balboa blocks eighty

percent of the blows with his

face -- Creed doesn't look the

best he's ever been but is

moving smoothly -- Creed snaps

out a triple combination that

backs Balboa into a corner --

oh, a solid hook by Creed, a

master of fist-men.

COMMENTATOR #2

The Champion is smiling and

toying with the man -- trying

to give the fans their money's

worth and make a show of it

with the badly out-classes

challenger -- Another left to

right combination.  I feel

sorry for --

COMMENTATOR #1

Creed is down!!!

MICKEY

You can do it!  Goddamnit, you

got the power!  The body, get

the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

REFEREE

Six!... Seven!... Eight!...

APOLLO

... Come at me, sucker!

107.

ROCKY

How am I doin'?

MICKEY

Real good.

ROCKY

See how fast he is -- damn!

MICKEY

Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin

down!!  Use the legs and drive

through 'im.  Attack --

Attack -- Attack!

APOLLO

(to Trainer)

... That boy damn near broke

my arm.

TRAINER

Sure -- He can hit -- Don't

play no more -- Stick an'

move, hear?

APOLLO

I'll carry him 'till the third.

TRAINER

Don't play with this man, he's

fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel

some real heat!

108.

APOLLO

Man, I rearranged his face

with that right -- The people

love what's happenin' tonight.

TRAINER

People nothin', you in a

fight, my man, -- ya best

believe what you hear... Knock

that boy out soon an' let's go

home.

MICKEY

Ya nose is broke.

ROCKY

Damn!  How's it look?

MICKEY

Can't hardly tell.  Don't

swallow the blood -- Go for

his ribs.  Don't let 'im

breathe.

ROCKY

... The guy's great.

MICKEY

Why don't ya tell 'im you're a

fan!

109.

COMMENTATOR #2

If you had asked anyone who

knows boxing, they never

would've predicted a first

round knockdown and the second

round punishment to the body

of the Champion... Most

fighters will tell you,

receiving a good body punch is

the next worst thing to dying.

COMMENTATOR #1

Round three ready to start and

should be interesting to see

if Creed can put the challenger

away -- there goes the bell.

COMMENTATOR #1

Apollo almost sprints out of

his corner -- feints and

throws a pair of left-right

combinations.  Balboa drops

beneath a left upper cut and

lands a very solid shot on

Creed's temple -- not much

movement from Balboa, duck a

left, a right, another left

and explodes with a right hook

to the temple -- I mean

explodes.  The Champ backs off.

COMMENTATOR #2

There's no way Apollo expected

this kind of hitting power.

COMMENTATOR #1

No way -- but the brilliant

ability of the Champion to

master situations like this is

one of his most outstanding

traits -- Creed tosses a

perfect right hand that rocks

Rocky.

(MORE)

110.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)

Creed on the offensive --

Balboa takes the punishment

and counters with a left flush

over the heart... that hurt.

TRAINER

(yelling)

Cover your face!  Cover up!

(to Assistant)

My man's cut, my man's

bleedin' -- Get ready!

TRAINER

Bad?  Talk to me, man!

DOCTOR

Deep, but passable.

APOLLO

(staring at Rocky)

... That man's takin' his job

too serious.

TRAINER

He's movin' to your left --

don't let him no more -- dance

and stick, hear?  Don't

play -- I know what ya feelin',

but don't play.

APOLLO

He got lucky.

TRAINER

Luck!  You fightin' a crazy

man -- but you got him hurt

bad.

(to Assistant)

More ice, now!

111.

MICKEY

How you holdin' up, kid?

ROCKY

Fine... That guy's great.

MICKEY

Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'

tagged with his right.  I

think you should feint left

and high hook 'im -- Benny,

check the eyes!  Can ya see?

ROCKY

(standing)

See what?

MIKE

Ya sappin' his strength --

He's losin' steam.

ROCKY

He ain't losin' nothin'.

MICKEY

Keep on him -- You're doin'

great.

112.

ANDY

... The Rock's got real stones.

APOLLO

C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

COMMENTATOR #1

Without a doubt this is the

most punishing brawl I have

ever seen -- The ringside

audience is spotted with blood.

(MORE)

113.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)

This fight should have been

stopped rounds ago but Rocky

Balboa refuses to fall --

COMMENTATOR #2

Not only has he refused to

fall, but he has beaten the

Champion's body without mercy

and the bout has become a

vicious slugfest.

give ya all.  I can't let ya

ROCKY

and quietly)

nothin' --

COMMENTATOR #1

The fight has slowed down to a

near stand-still -- Creed

circles to Rocky's right...

The spectrum is nearly

silent -- Neither fighter has

made a motion to throw... I've

never seen anything like it in

the last round of a

championship fight... Apollo

spits blood on the canvas.  It

appears he is protecting his

right side.  His ribs were

probably injured at the end of

round fourteen.

COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)

It's confirmed, unofficially,

Creed's ribs may be broken --

Apollo fakes a left and throws

a big tired right -- Balboa's

mouthpiece is out!  Creed

attacks with one hand!

ROCKY

Gimme ya best!!!!

ROCKY

(continuing)

Gimme ya best!!!
