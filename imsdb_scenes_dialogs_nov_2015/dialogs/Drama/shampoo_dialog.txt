Shampoo - by Robert Towne and Warren Beatty

FELICIA'S VOICE

Oh, no.

GEORGE'S VOICE

... what?...

FELICIA'S VOICE

That headboard.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Nobody can hear it.

FELICIA'S VOICE

I can. It makes me nervous.

FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

(complimentary)

Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus

Christ... Jesus H. Christ.

FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

(a slightly different

tone)

You going to answer it?

GEORGE'S VOICE

(meaning no)

Uh-uh.

FELICIA'S VOICE

(being for her very

mischievous)

Want me to?

GEORGE'S VOICE

Let it ring.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't

give up.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Hello...

(a little surprised)

Ah, hi.

TINA'S VOICE

What took you so long?

GEORGE'S VOICE

Wasn't sure it was you.

TINA'S VOICE

(muffled)

GEORGE'S VOICE

I... uh... I... uh... can't.

TINA'S VOICE

(laughter, sizing it up

immediately)

All right, who're you with? Jill?

GEORGE'S VOICE

No.

TINA'S VOICE

(lively but muffled)

GEORGE'S VOICE

No.

TINA'S VOICE

(she's heard Felicia)

Awww --

GEORGE'S VOICE

I'll call you back.

TINA'S VOICE

Come on by.

GEORGE'S VOICE

I'll call you back...

TINA'S VOICE

(raucous laughter,

muffled)

GEORGE'S VOICE

(to Tina)

Okay, okay...

FELICIA'S VOICE

You're rude. I mean, you're very

rude.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Hey, I tried to get her off the

phone.

FELICIA'S VOICE

You know what I'm talking about.

GEORGE'S VOICE

No, baby. Now look, that girl that

called -- I have to talk to her,

she'll do something.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Like what?

GEORGE'S VOICE

I don't know, kill herself. She's

O.D.'d four times.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Well, is she your girlfriend?

GEORGE'S VOICE

No.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Are you in love with her?

GEORGE'S VOICE

Her?

FELICIA'S VOICE

Are you?

GEORGE'S VOICE

No.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Then it's not your problem.

GEORGE'S VOICE

It isn't?

FELICIA'S VOICE

No. You know too many sick ladies.

GEORGE'S VOICE

I guess so.

FELICIA'S VOICE

How do you expect to get anything

done if you allow yourself to get

sidetracked? Particularly in your

business... you deal with women

every day...

GEORGE'S VOICE

I guess so.

FELICIA'S VOICE

Don't worry, honey, I'll protect

you.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Okay.

FELICIA'S VOICE

God, I adore you.

FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Shit.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Hello.

JILL'S VOICE

You're home.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Yeah.

JILL'S VOICE

I'm coming over.

GEORGE'S VOICE

I'll call you back.

JILL'S VOICE

(firm but frightened)

No you won't.

GEORGE'S VOICE

What do you mean?

JILL'S VOICE

I told you I get 'scared up here,

so if you're not coming right

now...

(muffled)

I'm not kidding.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Okay.

JILL'S VOICE

(muffled)

GEORGE'S VOICE

Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.

FELICIA

Whoever she is, she doesn't give

up, does she?

GEORGE

No.

FELICIA

What're you looking for?

GEORGE

My keys.

FELICIA

I thought you said you weren't

going anywhere.

GEORGE

I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this

friend of mine for a few minutes.

FELICIA

You mean that girl, don't you?

GEORGE

What girl, she's not a girl, she's

just a friend of mine.

FELICIA

You son of a bitch.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Wait, at least wait 'til I'm

dressed. I'm going.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Oh, Christ -- do you have any

Kleenex?

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Thanks a lot.

GEORGE

(desperate)

Listen, baby, don't leave, really.

FELICIA

Why not?

GEORGE

I'll be right back, it's just that

this girl is a different girl...

she has attacks.

FELICIA

What?

GEORGE

These attacks... it's got something

to do with her... uh... pancreas.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

She's got a...

FELICIA

(suddenly interested)

Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?

GEORGE

(anxious to go now)

Yeah, I think so.

FELICIA

That's very serious. Who's her

doctor?

GEORGE

I don't know.

FELICIA

Gee, that's very serious...

GEORGE

I know.

FELICIA

Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic

ulcer.

GEORGE

She did?

FELICIA

It turned out to be cancer.

GEORGE

Wow.

FELICIA

So what are you doing going over

there? You're not her doctor.

GEORGE

I've gotta give her some pills.

Percodan, she ran out.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

And listen, I'll be right back and

I want your ass in that bed when I

get back.

FELICIA

(acquiescing)

You're very rude... if you don't

come back --

GEORGE

I'll be back in a while.

FELICIA

I don't want to see you anymore.

GEORGE

I'll be right back, baby, really.

GIRL'S VOICE

George!

GEORGE

Hey, baby, what's happening!

GIRL

(not bad)

Nothing, my sister's back from

Vegas.

GEORGE

That's too bad.

GIRL

I have to see you.

GEORGE

Hey, stop by the shop.

JILL'S VOICE

(soft)

Who is it?

GEORGE

(furious)

Who do you think it is?

JILL

There were some shots.

GEORGE

What're you talking about?

JILL

Gunshots, there were some gunshots.

GEORGE

(looking around)

Where?

JILL

Here in the canyon.

GEORGE

Well, it's a big canyon.

(seeing she's upset)

Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get

back... just for a minute.

JILL

Let me come, too.

(pleading)

Please don't leave me alone.

GEORGE

What's gonna happen?

JILL

(near tears)

I don't know... every once in a

while I just get the feeling

something awful's going to happen.

GEORGE

Well, like what?

JILL

I don't know... just... somebody's

going to get me.

JILL (CONT'D)

I've had these dumb dreams lately.

GEORGE

What?

JILL

They're dumb, somebody... I don't

know...

GEORGE

(suspicious)

Who?

JILL

I just... who what?

GEORGE

You said somebody... who?

JILL

I don't know. I can't remember. It

was just in my dream.

GEORGE

No shit?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Nobody's gonna get you. Now get

inside.

JILL

(uncertain)

George, I don't --

GEORGE

You'll do what I tell you. Now get

the fuck inside.

JILL

George --

GEORGE

(moving after her)

Keep moving --

JILL

Now, George --

GEORGE

Nobody's gonna get you but me!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

How are you, baby?

JILL

Fine. How are you?

GEORGE

Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic.

Incredible. Incredible, really

incredible.

JILL

What?

GEORGE

I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm

gonna open the shop. I'm getting it

together.

JILL

How?

GEORGE

(rising)

Right now -- I'm at the epitome of

my life.

Right now I feel so good I'm afraid

something's gonna happen.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

When I was a little kid, I used to

want to go to Europe but right now

wherever I am I'm gonna be in

Europe.

JILL

Honey, what happened?

GEORGE

I just came from a meeting... I

can't talk about it now, baby. But

in a few days -- see I'm disgusted

with my life.

JILL

I thought you said you were at the

epitome of your life.

GEORGE

I am, I am. But I've had it with

chicks. They're like an

occupational hazard. Six guys

working for me... I'm gonna retire

or settle down or something.

JILL

What about me?

GEORGE

(meaning it)

You're different.

JILL

I am?

GEORGE

You're great.

JILL

I am?

GEORGE

Yeah.

JILL

Do you really mean that?

GEORGE

Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with

you.

JILL

Honey?

GEORGE

Yeah, baby.

JILL

Why am I great?

GEORGE

Jesus, I don't know. You're great.

JILL

Will we live together?

GEORGE

We live together now.

JILL

But in the same house, you know,

one house.

GEORGE

(just a slight hitch)

-- Sure.

JILL

Maybe you don't even like children.

GEORGE

Of course I like children.

JILL

You've never even been around one.

GEORGE

I'm around you and I like you,

don't I?

JILL

(smiling despite herself)

Yeah.

GEORGE

Okay...

(sinking back down)

Night, baby.

JILL

(after a moment)

George?

GEORGE

What!

JILL

Not right now, I don't mean right

now... but eventually...

GEORGE

(grumpy)

Okay, baby. Okay...

JILL

Jackie says she wouldn't bring

children into this world. That it's

hypocritical and overpopulated.

PETTIS

(looking up now)

Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about

you.

GEORGE

(smiling)

Right.

PETTIS

How is she?

GEORGE

Great.

PETTIS

Wonderful woman.

GEORGE

She is.

PETTIS

I went to school with her husband.

GEORGE

Great.

PETTIS

(pleasantly affirmative)

So you want to go in business for

yourself?

GEORGE

Right.

PETTIS

And you need money?

GEORGE

Right, that's right.

PETTIS

(smiling)

You do know what money's like these

days.

GEORGE

(no)

Well, yeah... you know.

PETTIS

Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and

three quarters -- that's our prime

rate. And I'll tell you something

else: the big boys are going for

it.

GEORGE

They are?

PETTIS

After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying

six percent. Six percent. FHA's at

eight and a half -- no, we won't be

going back to the old days.

GEORGE

I guess not...

PETTIS

It's got nothing to do with

inflation. Rates, for example, rise

independently of tight money if you

look at interest curves carefully.

Historically, that's always been

true, though most people don't

realize it.

PETTIS (CONT'D)

What sort of references do you

have?

GEORGE

Well, I do Barbara Rush.

PETTIS

Pardon me?

GEORGE

(embarrassed now)

Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.

PETTIS

I mean credit references, Mr.

Roundy.

JACKIE

I think you're crazy. Don't look

over, it's Lenny Silverman.

JILL

Who is that?

JACKIE

(deadly)

A real swinger. He's been trying to

fuck me for about two hundred

years.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(pleasantly)

Hi, Leonard.

LEONARD

Jackie, what're you doing?

JACKIE

(they're having coffee)

Going for a pony ride at

Kiddielands, want to come along?

LEONARD

I have to meet a client... who're

you dating?

JACKIE

Poster-Kleiser.

LEONARD

Oh yeah?

JACKIE

That's right.

LEONARD

I'll call you.

JACKIE

Fine.

LEONARD

See you later.

JACKIE

Anyway, you're crazy.

JILL

I am? I mean why?

JACKIE

Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.

JILL

I'm not. Maybe I am.

JACKIE

No, listen. He's a very good

hairdresser.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Well, he is.

JILL

(annoyed)

So what's your point?

JACKIE

Jill, I'm just trying to be

helpful.

JILL

I know, I'm sorry.

JACKIE

I spent three years with him. I

just couldn't take it not knowing

who was gonna pay the rent... his

unemployment or mine. George was

adorable but it drove me crackers.

Now at least I'm comfortable.

Lester does what he says he'll do.

Maybe you're happy living like a

gypsy. Are you?

JILL

George is great but I know what you

mean.

JACKIE

Face it, you can go around with

cute guys and get hung up on their

sexy bodies and things like that

but sooner or later you've got to

find somebody. Face it, time isn't

on your side.

JILL

I guess not.

GEORGE

(giving it all he's got)

I've got the customers... that's my

point. I'm the one they want. If I

had my own shop, they'd leave and

come to me. I have a lot of

customers.

PETTIS

Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you

make out a financial statement?

It'll save us both some time. Miss

Michaels here can show you... have

it notarized and we'll see where we

go from there. Miss Michaels, would

you get me a couple of forms?

JILL

Egypt?

POPE

That's right.

JILL

But why Egypt?

POPE

Well, that's where the pyramids are

and we want real pyramids in the

ad.

PRODUCER

You seem disappointed.

JILL

No... how long did you say?

PRODUCER

Three weeks.

JILL

Egypt?

PRODUCER

Look, is there somewhere else you'd

rather go? Maybe we can change our

location.

JILL

No, it's not that...

PRODUCER

Do you have children?

JILL

No.

PRODUCER

Are you married?

JILL

No.

PRODUCER

Do you have something against

traveling?

JILL

(unable to interpret

Pope's looks to her)

No.

POPE

Well, do you have something against

us?

JILL

No!

PRODUCER

(to Pope, he's wasting

time)

John...

POPE

(ignoring him)

Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.

JILL

Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.

PRODUCER

We'll let you know tomorrow.

JILL

Please don't misunderstand... I'd

really like to go.

PRODUCER

(a little sarcastic)

Thanks for coming by.

JILL

Oh. thank you.

POPE

Sure.

POPE (CONT'D)

(shaking his head)

This town...

GIRL

Hi, George.

GEORGE

Hey, baby, what's happening?

GIRL

Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you

know, the guy I divorced last

summer.

GEORGE

Great, great. I hope you make it.

GIRL

Call me!

GEORGE

I don't have your number, stop by

the shop.

GIRL

(waving goodbye)

Okay!

GEORGE

(disgusted)

God damn it.

TINA

Great... great... great... great...

great!

TINA (CONT'D)

Great, Dennis.

TINA (CONT'D)

Do you think there's enough height?

I mean do you think there's enough

height?

TINA (CONT'D)

George, do you think there's enough

height?

GEORGE

(on way to Felicia)

Yeah, sure.

TINA

Dennis doesn't think so.

DENNIS

Man, I didn't say a word.

TINA

Well, what do you think? Is there

enough height?

FELICIA

You're late, George.

GEORGE

(taking her to his

cubicle)

I gotta talk to you.

FELICIA

I don't want to talk about it...

GEORGE

But you don't know what happened.

FELICIA

I don't care.

TINA

George, do you think there's too

much height?

GEORGE

(seating her)

It's great. You don't know what

happened, this girl she almost got--

FELICIA

(a little hysterical)

I don't care about that girl, I

don't care if she's dead.

GEORGE

Calm down, baby.

FELICIA

(calming down)

I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm

simply saying you have no respect

for me, that you're incapable of

distinguishing between me and one

of your average Hollywood...

mummers...

GEORGE

-- What?

FELICIA

Nummers.

GEORGE

What?

FELICIA

-- Numbers, and I don't need to

place myself in that kind of

position.

GEORGE

What're you here for?

GLORIA

(as if giving away a

secret)

-- A wash and set.

GEORGE

No.

GLORIA

No?

GEORGE

You need a cut.

GLORIA

But Mr. Norman said --

GEORGE

Said what!

GLORIA

(whispered)

I just needed a wash and set, a

wash and set, that's all.

GEORGE

Well, baby, I'm George and it needs

to be cut.

(to Felicia)

But I don't want to place you in

that position either.

FELICIA

-- I like myself far too much, far

too much.

GEORGE

I don't want to place you in any

position --

FELICIA

-- to be put in that kind of

position...

GEORGE

(to Gloria)

I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!

MARY

(a schvar)

Yeah!

GEORGE

Wash her.

MARY

(looking at Gloria)

What with?

GEORGE

(nudging her)

-- A brillo pad, I don't care,

anything.

MARY

-- You takin' a lot of shit lately,

George.

GEORGE

-- Oh yeah.

MARY

(mixing)

But then again you ask for it --

you just like my Otis -- can't keep

his hands outta ladies' hair

either.

GEORGE

-- White ladies?

MARY

(laughing, too)

-- Oh my yes.

FELICIA

(burning with anger)

George --

GEORGE

(calling back)

I'm coming, baby --

(to Mary)

How's Otis doing, anyway?

MARY

That boy always does great. He's a

corporal or a squad leader or

something, just wrote me from some

place called Kwang Due?

GEORGE

I don't know if you don't know --

FELICIA

George!

FELICIA (CONT'D)

(going  right on)

I'm not used to that kind of

treatment.

GEORGE

What kind of treatment?

FELICIA

(going right on)

I've never been treated that way,

and I'm not going to start now.

GEORGE

Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been

cutting too much hair lately. I'm

losing all my concepts...

JILL

George.

GEORGE

Hey, baby, what's happening?

JILL

They want me to go to Egypt for

three weeks.

GEORGE

Great.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Jill, say hello to Felicia.

JILL

Hello.

FELICIA

Hello.

JILL

George.

GEORGE

Yeah, baby...

JILL

How did it go at the bank?

GEORGE

Great.

JILL

Could I talk to you for a second?

GEORGE

Hey, I'm, you know --

JILL

Could I?

GEORGE

Yeah.

JILL

(with some feeling)

I said I wasn't sure if I could go.

GEORGE

Go where?

JILL

(impatiently)

Egypt!

GEORGE

Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta

get back, okay?

JILL

Okay, but how did it go at the

bank?

GEORGE

Great... can we talk later?

NORMAN

(the shop's owner)

George!

GEORGE

Yeah.

NORMAN

You're late, we're all backed up

and you're supposed to go to

Buffums.

GEORGE

Buffums?

NORMAN

Yes, Buffums.

GEORGE

I've got heads here, Norman.

NORMAN

You promised you'd do the show.

GEORGE

Oh fuck, Norman!

NORMAN

Don't use that tone of voice with

me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.

RICCI

Do you know what that Lillian

Bercovici just did?

GEORGE

(working on Felicia)

No, man.

RICCI

-- Right after I sprayed her?

GEORGE

What?

RICCI

(losing control)

She touched it! Then she played in

it and got it all into something

else. Now I don't know what it is!

RICCI (CONT'D)

I can't even stand to talk to her

on the phone.

GEORGE

(sympathetic)

She's heavy.

(to Felicia)

See, Norman expects me to get in

here, take care of all the

customers and then do his show out

in Norwalk. I gotta have my own

shop, just out of self defense.

FELICIA

I can see that.

GEORGE

You're looking great, baby.

FELICIA

What're you doing later?

GEORGE

(half kidding)

Whatever you say.

FELICIA

We have this political thing

tonight. Could you comb me out at

the house?

GEORGE

I don't know. I'm beginning to feel

guilty.

FELICIA

What about?

GEORGE

All I ever do is play. I should be

doing something to get my own shop

open.

FELICIA

Why don't you see Lester?

GEORGE

(a little alarmed)

Your husband?

FELICIA

Yes.

GEORGE

(not sure what she's

driving at)

What about?

FELICIA

The shop. I think you're a good

investment, and I don't mind

telling him.

GEORGE

Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.

JILL

George.

GEORGE

Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.

JILL

I already said hello.

GEORGE

Okay.

JILL

George.

GEORGE

Yeah, baby.

JILL

When can I talk to you?

GEORGE

Baby, I'm in the middle of work.

JILL

I know but this is important. I

have to make a decision.

GEORGE

About what?

JILL

Whether or not I'm going.

GEORGE

Going where?

JILL

Egypt.

GEORGE

Honey, have they offered you the

job?

JILL

No, but I think they might.

GEORGE

(to Jill)

Just a second, I'll be right with

you...

FELICIA

(interested)

Is she all right?

GEORGE

I don't know. Just a minute...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

What do you want?

JILL

Your advice!

GEORGE

They didn't offer you the job yet.

JILL

I want your feelings about it.

GEORGE

Right now?

JILL

Look, either we have a meaningful

relationship or we don't, I've got

to know.

GEORGE

(really harassed)

Look, baby, can we talk about it

later?

JILL

When?

GEORGE

When I get off work.

JILL

When is that?

GEORGE

I'll call you.

JILL

When is that, George?

GEORGE

I'll call you.

JILL

(really upset)

But I never know when you're

working and when you're not

working!

GEORGE

(half to himself)

Neither do I, baby.

JILL

What?

GEORGE

Nothing, I'll call you, okay?

JILL

... Okay...

GEORGE

-- Anyway.

FELICIA

I hope she's all right.

GEORGE

She's fine. You really think I'd be

a good investment?

FELICIA

I wouldn't say so if I didn't.

GEORGE

No, I know.

FELICIA

And I certainly wouldn't tell

Lester.

GEORGE

I know.

FELICIA

I mean it or I wouldn't say it.

GEORGE

That's great. You look great, baby,

great. Dennis, look at Felicia's

hair.

DENNIS & DESK GIRL

Great.

LESTER

Look, Kurt, I don't care where you

have to go. I want Beluga Caviar

there. Call Jurgenson's, call

Chasen's... I don't care how much

it costs... how much?... then spend

it. Just make sure it's there.

You've got all the money in the

world to buy it. You understand?

Just make sure it's there on the

table tonight.

(he hangs up)

Jesus.

(to George, to no one)

You've got to do everything

yourself. You know?

LESTER (CONT'D)

Felicia says you're a very good

hairdresser.

GEORGE

Well, yeah.

LESTER

She says you're a fabulous

hairdresser.

GEORGE

Thank you.

LESTER

I didn't say it, she did. How'd you

happen to get in that line of work?

GEORGE

Oh, well, I went to beauty

school... you know you go to beauty

school... and you get your

operator's license... and you

graduate... and you're a

hairdresser.

LESTER

I see.

LESTER (CONT'D)

It's an unusual trade.

GEORGE

Yes it is.

LESTER

But the important thing is you're

successful at it.

GEORGE

In a way. But...

LESTER

But what?

GEORGE

I'm better than the guy I work for.

LESTER

Well, George, I invest for a lot of

people. I make a lot of money for

them. More than they could do for

themselves.

GEORGE

After a while that hurts... doesn't

it?

LESTER

It's good you want to do something,

George.

GEORGE

Thank you.

LESTER

But personal services are not the

kind of thing I usually get into.

GEORGE

They're not?

LESTER

(suddenly direct, almost

enthusiastic)

No, they're a pain in the ass,

there's no way of keeping track of

anything. It's a cash business and

you've got to watch your operators

or they'll steal you blind, am I

right or am I right?

GEORGE

You're right.

LESTER

Who needs that kind of aggravation?

Who needs that kind of aggravation

at my age? When I finish work I

want to...

SECRETARY

Mr. Karpf...

JACKIE

I'm sorry but I need an extra

garage key.

LESTER

What for? What do you need the key

for?

JACKIE

The man from Sloan's is coming. I

called you about it.

LESTER

How did you lose that key? Oh,

George, this is uh Miss -- this is

Jackie.

JACKIE

Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.

LESTER

(a little suspiciously)

Is that right?

JACKIE

(almost immediately on the

defensive)

Well, yes, George is a wonderful

hairdresser.

LESTER

Is that right?

JACKIE

So how's Norman?

GEORGE

Great. Who's been doing your hair?

JACKIE

I go to the blue'n gold barber shop

in Westwood. The guy in the third

chair's dynamite... nobody much.

LESTER

George is going to open a shop.

JACKIE

(really interested)

No kidding? Your own shop?

LESTER

George, could you -- excuse us for

a minute?

GEORGE

Sure.

LESTER

I called to tell you I was sending

one over but the line was busy,

you're always on the phone.

JACKIE

I am?

LESTER

Who were you talking to?

JACKIE

Who do you think I was talking to?

LESTER

My secretary saw you with that boy.

JACKIE

Steve?

LESTER

Whatever his name is, that actor.

JACKIE

Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.

(a touch bitter)

Steve couldn't get arrested as an

actor. He couldn't get arrested as

a boy.

LESTER

Then you were talking to him.

JACKIE

I ran into him at the 76 station on

little Santa Monica, what was I

supposed to do, hide in the ladies

room? Yes, I was talking to him.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(an outburst)

I'm always on the phone because you

never let me see anybody, I can't

even bring my girlfriends over to

the house because they might run

into you. You're driving me up the

wall, Lester. You're even jealous

of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have

somebody I can talk to.

LESTER

I'm not jealous of the dogs.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(very positive)

Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous

of anybody, I just can't afford to

get caught... off base.

JACKIE

So I can't talk to some broken down

actor, what do you think, I'm going

to tell him I'm screwing Lester

Karpf!

LESTER

Of course not.

JACKIE

That's not very logical, Lester.

SECRETARY

He thinks the room is soundproofed.

Don't tell him it's not.

GEORGE

How come?

SECRETARY

He'll have that awful construction

crew back again, and they can never

do anything right.

LESTER

(trying to think of why)

It's very logical, it's the most

logical thing in the world. You

wouldn't feel this confined if we

could go out with people and have

dinner, and a little conversation

and so forth...

JACKIE

Really? How about starting with

tonight?

LESTER

Sweetheart, I know it's rough but

at this point -- my business

involves handling money for some

very touchy people, politics and so

on... Felicia's at a very difficult

period in her life... any divorce

and settlement and so forth, my

finances would have to be looked

into.

JACKIE

(quietly)

You and your touchy investors.

LESTER

(finally)

Look... you do well for people,

they don't ask you to stop. Nobody

wants you to stop making money,

doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all

want their share.

JACKIE

You're lying about one thing,

Lester.

LESTER

What's that?

JACKIE

You're still jealous.

LESTER

God, you're a doll.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(he means it)

We'll work something out about

tonight, I promise...

LESTER

Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key

for the Bowmont House, would you?

ANGIE

Yes, Mr. Karpf.

LESTER

Well, let's go down together.

C'mon, George, I'll walk you out.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(quietly)

Felicia's really interested in the

shop, isn't she?

GEORGE

Oh yeah.

LESTER

(normal tone now)

Well, George, you may not think ten

or fifteen grand means much to me,

but I invest for myself and a lot

of particular people.

GEORGE

Oh yeah? I mean I know.

LESTER

So I'm going to want a little more

of your thinking on the subject.

GEORGE

When?

LESTER

When?

LESTER

(looks up slowly)

How about tonight?

GEORGE

Tonight?

LESTER

Yeah, little election party I'm

giving at the Bistro.

It's a pain in the ass but -- I

have to do it. We'll have a little

time to talk there.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(quiet, almost solemn in

their presence)

-- maybe you could, on your way,

you know, pick up Jackie here.

GEORGE

(slowly)

Okay.

LESTER

It's good you want to do something,

George.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I wish my son knew what he wanted

to do.

GEORGE

Oh yeah?

LESTER

-- Anything, I don't care what it

is, just so it's something.

GEORGE

I know what you mean.

LESTER

(thoughtfully)

Maybe he ought to go to beauty

school. Anyway, see you tonight,

doll, okay?

JACKIE

Fine.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Jesus...

GEORGE

-- Yeah... your car down here?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

-- Listen, I'm supposed to take

Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's

really going to be pissed if I

don't.

JACKIE

-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I

tell her how important it is to me,

I don't think she'll mind. Do you?

GEORGE

I don't know. Probably not.

JACKIE

Jill's really great, isn't she?

GEORGE

Great... so how's everything with

you?

JACKIE

Great, more or less.

GEORGE

How long you had this?

JACKIE

Oh, about six weeks now... Lester --

well, he's very sweet.

GEORGE

I'm sure.

JACKIE

He's a very private person,

actually.

GEORGE

Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know

that we went together, does he?

JACKIE

-- Well no. It never came up.

GEORGE

You going to tell him?

JACKIE

(smoothly)

-- What for? Honey, I'll see you

later.

JACKIE

Jill, you're a real sweetie pie.

You really are.

(she glances over at Jill)

You're sure you don't mind?

JILL

Don't be silly.

JACKIE

You're really a love -- you sure?

JILL

-- No. No really.

JACKIE

Well, what is it, honey?

JILL

Nothing.

JACKIE

It must be something.

JILL

Well, it's George.

JACKIE

I thought you said things were

great with George.

JILL

Well they are. But we have

problems. You say things are great

with Lester. Is he going to marry

you?

JACKIE

We don't think marriage is

important.

JILL

But you have problems?

JACKIE

-- Yeah, honey...

JILL

I don't know. One minute he's up in

the air and makes love to me five

times a day and tells me

everything's going to be great and

he's getting his own shop and then

suddenly he disappears and he won't

even talk to me. It's driving me

crazy.

JACKIE

Five times a day?

JILL

(sighs, then)

-- I guess it's all got to do with

this shop.

JACKIE

Really, Jill, aren't you

exaggerating just a little? Five

times a day?

JILL

(embarrassed)

Well, you know what I mean.

JACKIE

After four years? No I don't... and

I don't know too many girls who do.

JILL

I'm exaggerating.

JACKIE

How much?

JILL

(giggling a little)

Jackie --

JACKIE

What?

JILL

(taking a little  breath)

Well... it's not so much the number

of times he does it, it's... he

does it for a long time.

JACKIE

He does?

JILL

Well yes -- you know that about

George.

JACKIE

It's been so long I don't how long?

JILL

Quite a while... an hour, an hour

and a half -- sometimes forty-five

minutes -- that's quite a while,

isn't It?

JACKIE

I would say so, yes.

JILL

Honey?

JACKIE

What?

JILL

I think you're going to hit that

car in front of us.

JILL

-- See, I just know that if I go to

Egypt, well, things happen, I just

don't know what'll happen to us, he

just never seems to think ahead,

does he?

JACKIE

-- When you say forty-five minutes

or an hour, do you mean continuous

time? Just continually, without

stopping?

JILL

-- Well -- not going in and out, I

don't mean just that. Why are you

asking me? You went with George

longer than I have.

JACKIE

-- I guess I just blocked it out,

that's all.

JILL

C'mon.

JACKIE

Well, there was this one time --

JILL

(a little devilish)

-- Yesss?

JACKIE

-- I was in the kitchen doing the

dishes and George was out in Long

Beach doing a show...

JILL

(meaning yes)

-- uhh-huhh...

JACKIE

-- Well it was very hot so I'd left

the door open and the water was

running so I didn't hear him come

down the stairs...

JILL

... Mmm-hmmm.

JACKIE

-- He came up behind me and I was

wiping a dish and he just... lifted

up my skirt, and, you know, right

there...

JILL

Didn't you have any panties on?

JACKIE

(remembering)

-- He reached up and tore them.

JILL

What did you do?

JACKIE

Well... I just kept wiping that

dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very

sexy but it was.

JILL

(faintly perturbed)

No, it sounds very sexy -- did you

just stay by the sink all that

time?

JACKIE

No, he picked me up and carried me

out to the sundeck -- God, it was

hot. The wood on the sundeck,

everything.

LESTER

Do you think George is a fairy?

FELICIA

Who?

LESTER

That kid... the hairdresser.

FELICIA

Well, I don't know for sure... he's

a hairdresser.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Thank you, Mona.

LESTER

Maybe he's just a kooky guy who

likes doing something kooky like

that.

FELICIA

Maybe... why do you ask?

LESTER

I'm thinking of investing with him.

He worries me.

FELICIA

Why?

LESTER

Maybe he's too flighty and

irresponsible. That's why I asked

if he was a fairy.

FELICIA

I don't know. He's a hairdresser.

LESTER

(really asking)

You suggested it, don't you think

it's a good idea?

FELICIA

Yes, but... I thought...

LESTER

What?

FELICIA

That you were just indulging me.

LESTER

No, doll, I listen to you. And if a

deal loses money that's not so bad

either if it's handled right.

LESTER (CONT'D)

He's a nice boy. I invited him

tonight. I'm sorry he's a fairy.

ANJANETTE

You're in a good mood today,

George.

GEORGE

Yeah, baby. Things are great.

Listen, there's Devra, whatta you

want?

ANJANETTE

Chicken salad.

GEORGE

Chicken salad, Devra!

DEVRA

I don't have any change.

GEORGE

Get some at the desk.

ANJANETTE

Anyway, you remember Harold?

GEORGE

Yeah, baby, how's it going?

NORMAN

George... Jackie Shawn.

GEORGE

No, I'd like to but I've got too

many heads here, can't you stop by

the shop?

(to shampoo girl)

Two caps, Mary, yeah, two.

(back to phone)

Okay, but I have to be in Bel Air

at four...

ANJANETTE

Don't you think there's too much

gold?

GEORGE

(to Anjanette)

It's great.

(into phone)

You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...

ANJANETTE

I don't know, I think...

GEORGE

(good natured, but firm)

Look, would you argue with your

doctor?

ANJANETTE

No.

GEORGE

(to Ricci)

Hey, what's happening?

(calling)

Mary! Telephone.

(to Ricci)

What's the matter?

RICCI

(furious)

Wanda...

GEORGE

Oh yeah?

RICCI

You were supposed to handle that

bitch, she's always asking for you,

and she was furious you weren't

here.

GEORGE

Yeah?...

RICCI

She's murdered her hair... you do

something with her, I'm never going

to touch her again.

GEORGE

I'm busy, man.

RICCI

If I have to touch her again, I'll

throw up!

GEORGE

(exploding)

Don't talk like a child. You're a

pro, now get out there and cut!

ANJANETTE

I thought you were in a good mood.

GEORGE

I am... except I've gotta do

somebody at their house.

ANJANETTE

Don't you like her?

GEORGE

No, it's a very groovy girl.

ANJANETTE

Then what's the problem?

GEORGE

(really worried)

She's a very groovy girl. That's

the problem.

ANJANETTE

What're you talking about, George?

GEORGE

Well, it's a small town. Sooner or

later things catch up with you...

don't they?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Where's the caps, Mary?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Mary? What's goin' on, Mary?

JACKIE

Hi. C'mon in.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Shut up, it's all right.

(to George, automatically)

Do you want a drink?

GEORGE

No, thanks.

JACKIE

Well, I do.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Where do you want to do this?

GEORGE

Probably the bathroom.

JACKIE

Can't you do it out here?

GEORGE

Well, it depends. If you just

wanted a combout. I guess I could.

JACKIE

Well, what do you think?

GEORGE

I don't know. Why don't you sit

down.

JACKIE

(meaning her position)

Is this all right?

GEORGE

Yeah.

JACKIE

(a little nervous)

Well, what do you think?

GEORGE

I'd cut it...

JACKIE

You would?

GEORGE

Yeah, I think so...

JACKIE

(almost irritable)

You don't seem very sure.

GEORGE

No, I'm sure.

JACKIE

(then)

Okay... but I want you to know one

thing.

(almost a threat)

I've got to look great tonight, I

mean I have to look great, okay?

GEORGE

Okay.

FELICIA

Mona, Mona!

FELICIA (CONT'D)

(indicates earring)

Have you seen the other one of

these by any chance? I want to wear

them tonight.

(before Mona can answer)

Oh... when George gets here, tell

him to wait. I have to pick up a

dress and I may have to have it

fitted, but be sure...

FELICIA (CONT'D)

... to tell him to wait.

MONA

Yes, ma'am. But I have to go to the

market...

FELICIA

Just be sure he doesn't leave.

JACKIE

Jill's coming with us.

GEORGE

Great.

JACKIE

She's incredible...

(after a moment)

She loves you, George.

GEORGE

Yeah... I mean great.

JACKIE

Getting my hair cut is always a

little nerve-wracking.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

... I don't get it done often.

GEORGE

Whew.

JACKIE

What's wrong?

GEORGE

It's hot in here.

JACKIE

(after a moment)

It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on

and it makes the whole bathroom

hot.

GEORGE

Yeah... wow.

JACKIE

(finally)

Not too much, don't cut too much.

GEORGE

Jackie, would you argue with your

doctor.

JACKIE

The shrink? Many times.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Bernstein... seemed to think I

hated men.

GEORGE

Do you? You still see him?

JACKIE

(with some feeling)

No.

GEORGE

Why not?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Why not?

JACKIE

... he tried to... uh... make it

with me.

GEORGE

And?

JACKIE

And what?

GEORGE

Did you?

JACKIE

It was after you, baby. After you.

GEORGE

(breathes deeply)

Boy, that sauna is really... can't

you turn it down or something?

JACKIE

No... Lester likes it on all the

time in case he wants to use it.

JILL

Hello... oh hi, Johnny. Oh really?

Thank you... Are you serious?...

Tonight I'm busy, I... Right now?

Oh no, you really couldn't come up

here.

JACKIE

Anyway, he offered me a silver

cloud. At least he should give me a

Ferrari and pay off my house and

give me a nine carat ring or

something...

GEORGE

(amused)

Did Lester know about him?

JACKIE

There was nothing to know.

Anyway... if I can't have love I

have to at least have money. I have

to have some pride I can do

something.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(staring at the scissors,

a warning)

George...

GEORGE

I just have to do one little thing.

JACKIE

If you screw me up for tonight,

I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll

kill you.

GEORGE

I won't screw you up.

JACKIE

George... how about Felicia?

GEORGE

(expressionless)

What?

JACKIE

Did you?

GEORGE

Did I what?

JACKIE

You know what I'm talking about.

GEORGE

Hey, I don't tell.

JACKIE

(teasing)

Can I count on that? I just want to

see Lester with me and that cunt in

the same room tonight.

GEORGE

Yeah?

JACKIE

Well, did you or didn't you?

GEORGE

Now, baby... if I told you about

her... then you couldn't count on

me not telling anymore... could

you?

JACKIE

You did, didn't you?

GEORGE

Baby...

JACKIE

You did, I know you did.

GEORGE

One of my few virtues is

discretion.

JACKIE

You just can't stand to miss one of

them, can you?

JACKIE

(softly)

George...

GEORGE

(staring at her)

Yeah, baby...

JACKIE

You're a genius.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(grabbing it, thrilled)

You're a genius, do you know that,

you're a genius?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(trying to resist)

Oh, no.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Oh, no.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(genuine)

No! Don't! Please!

GEORGE

(forcing her down)

I don't want to... I swear...

JACKIE

It'll ruin everything.

GEORGE

I know... you don't know, I know.

JACKIE

Don't, don't, don't...

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(moans)

Oh, no...

JACKIE (CONT'D)

It's Lester.

LESTER'S VOICE

(muffled)

Hey, doll... Jackie... honey...

where are you?

JACKIE

Get up, get up, get up.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Oh God, oh God, oh God... do

something, please God, do

something.

LESTER'S VOICE

(nearer)

Hey, baby, are you sleeping?

GEORGE

Sit down.

JACKIE

(frantic)

What are you talking about?

GEORGE

(equally frantic, forcing

her)

Sit down!

LESTER

Jackie?... Jackie?

JACKIE

Shut the door, shut the door!

LESTER

Oh, I'm sorry.

GEORGE

Look, either come in or stay out!

JACKIE

Shut the door, Lester. What do you

think this is, a picnic?

LESTER

(confused now)

Sorry, honey, I...

GEORGE

That's okay, that's okay, just shut

the door.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

... she's very upset...

LESTER

What about, tonight?

GEORGE

(seizing the opportunity)

That, and... I'll be done in a

minute.

LESTER'S VOICE

Jackie?... Hey, I brought you a

little something, doll.

LESTER

You look like you've had quite a

work-out.

GEORGE

It's nerve wracking sometimes...

women can get you very upset.

LESTER

I know it, I know it.

GEORGE

... this doing hair it's...

LESTER

I know it, son. But tonight's going

to be even tougher.

LESTER (CONT'D)

George, I know you have to deal

with Felicia and you're caught in

the middle, and if you can just

bear with me tonight, well, I

appreciate the way you've handled

the situation.

GEORGE

Oh, hey...

LESTER

It's a difficult situation, and I

want you to know I appreciate it.

Tonight's going to be real tough

for me --

GEORGE

I don't know what to...

LESTER

Son, we'll do business, I can tell

you that.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I'd like a drink.

JACKIE

(looking up)

Just a second, I've gotta clean

this mess up or the dogs'll have it

all over the house.

LESTER

You ought to get rid of those dogs.

LESTER (CONT'D)

They get hair all over the place.

JACKIE

They're Yorkies and they don't

shed.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(giving him a drink)

Here.

LESTER

Aren't you going to have one?

JACKIE

No.

LESTER

Why not?

JACKIE

Because I don't want one.

LESTER

C'mon, doll, it's five o'clock,

have a drink.

JACKIE

I don't want one! First you tell me

not to drink then you tell me to

drink, which is it? I don't want a

drink!

LESTER

I called to tell you I was on my

way, but the line was busy, you're

always on the phone.

LORNA

You here to see my mother?

GEORGE

Yeah.

LORNA

She's out, but you're supposed to

wait.

LORNA (CONT'D)

Hungry?

GEORGE

A little.

LORNA

(indicating refrigerators)

This is the one thing I like about

this house... want some lox?

GEORGE

No thanks.

LORNA

You're my mother's hairdresser?

GEORGE

(warily)

I do her hair, yeah.

LORNA

Chopped liver?

GEORGE

No thanks.

LORNA

Are you gay?... baked apple?...

they're cold but they're good.

GEORGE

No thanks.

LORNA

Did you hear me?

GEORGE

Yeah.

LORNA

Well, are you? Are you queer?

GEORGE

... yeah.

LORNA

(laughing)

C'mon, are you or aren't you?

GEORGE

(trying to avoid it)

Gee, this is great.

LORNA

C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.

GEORGE

Why do you wanna know so bad?

LORNA

See if you've been making it with

my mother.

GEORGE

(looking at her for a

minute, he changes his

tone)

What would my being a faggot have

to do with that?

LORNA

Nothing, I guess... have you ever

made it with a guy?

GEORGE

Have you ever made it with a girl?

LORNA

I asked you first.

GEORGE

Yeah... I've made it with a girl...

LORNA

Well, are you?

GEORGE

Am I what?

LORNA

Making it with my mother?

GEORGE

I'd like to do your hair sometime.

LORNA

Why?

GEORGE

... just, you could look very

heavy...

LORNA

Don't make conversation with me.

GEORGE

What?

LORNA

You don't have to make conversation

with me, I'm not my mother... do

you have a thing about older

women... that's sort of faggoty

isn't it?

GEORGE

Yeah, it is.

LORNA

I never get my hair done.

GEORGE

No kidding.

LORNA

In fact, I don't think I've ever

been to a beauty parlor in my whole

life.

GEORGE

No shit.

LORNA

You think that's funny, don't you?

GEORGE

(laughing a little)

Yeah.

LORNA

You live a phony cheap cop-out

existence.

GEORGE

(determined to be light)

Yeah...

LORNA

Beverly Hills hairdresser... what

kind of a thing is that to do...

you might as well be a faggot...

think that's funny too?

GEORGE

No.

LORNA

Then what do you think?

GEORGE

That you're just like your mother.

LORNA

I am not like my mother!

GEORGE

You are.

LORNA

I am not!

GEORGE

You are.

LORNA

I am not!

GEORGE

(he starts to placate her)

Look...

(then defiantly)

Do you wanna fuck me?

LORNA

(defiantly)

Yeah.

GEORGE

(uneasily)

Right now?

LORNA

(a little more tentative

now that the moment has

arrived)

Yeah.

POPE

(tapping him)

Oh, scraves...

WAITER

Yes?

POPE

Thank you.

WAITER

What for?

POPE

Taking your hair out of my salad.

WAITER

Oh, I'm sorry.

JILL

Why don't you ask for another one?

POPE

Are you kidding? His hair's

probably the most nutritious thing

in here. See, you've reduced me to

eating weeds.

JILL

... my friend doesn't like it here

either.

POPE

All right, forget this filth.

Continue about your friend.

JILL

Well he's not exactly a friend.

POPE

Is he an enemy?

JILL

(laughing)

Of course not... he's sort of a

boyfriend.

POPE

-- sort of a boyfriend?

JILL

Sort of.

POPE

I see. You mean he just sort of

fucks you.

JILL

Johnny!

POPE

My God, did I say that? I don't

believe it.

POPE (CONT'D)

I'm terribly sorry.

JILL

(amused)

-- never mind.

POPE

What does he do? Is he an actor?

JILL

-- no.

POPE

Good for you.

JILL

He's a hairdresser.

POPE

-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How...

how do you a... meet a hairdresser?

JILL

Getting your hair done...

(looks at him, abruptly)

Would you like to go to a party?

POPE

Not with your hairdresser.

FELICIA

Lorna?

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Have you seen George?

LORNA

He's in the bathroom.

FELICIA

Your bathroom?

LORNA

Yes.

GEORGE

Hi.

FELICIA

(coolly)

Hello, George.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

I've missed you.

GEORGE

I've... missed you too.

FELICIA

(touched)

It's okay, honey... it's okay now.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

Comb my hair out later, honey.

GEORGE

No, that's okay, I'll do It now.

FELICIA

No, baby... I'm glad you're coming

tonight.

GEORGE

(looking toward the door)

But aren't you...

FELICIA

Right now, I just don't care.

GEORGE

(?)

Jill says nothing.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Where's your car?

JILL

A friend dropped me off.

GEORGE

Who?

JILL

Never mind. Where've you been?

GEORGE

A business meeting, I told you

that.

JILL

What business meeting?

GEORGE

Look at the way I live.

JILL

I've been trying to reach you all

afternoon. You weren't in the shop.

What is this thing tonight?

GEORGE

What do you mean, what is it? It's

some political bullshit.

JILL

I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't

you think you could call me and let

me know? Look at my hair.

GEORGE

Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you

think I want to go to some God

damned party? I'm trying to get

that God damned shop open. I'm

trying to get a little bread

together. That's all I'm doing.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I just wanna live like everybody

else, that's all. I want clothes in

the closet, and food in the

refrigerator, and I don't want shit

all over the house and running my

ass all over town... I want my own

house... I want an appointment

book... I want to get up in the

morning and go to bed at night... I

want a normal life like everybody

else, that's all.

JILL

I know, honey.

GEORGE

Maybe I should get a dog... no, it

would just shit all over the house

and I'd never clean it up.

JILL

(laughing a little,

touching him)

Oh, honey. If we had one place, we

could have a nicer place and I

could take care of it. We're almost

never here.

JACKIE

(looking at George looking

in mirror)

-- you'll be the prettiest thing in

the room -- light's green...

GEORGE

(he takes off)

-- oh yeah... what do you know

about this guy?

JACKIE

-- what guy?

GEORGE

(gesturing toward rear

window)

-- this guy with Jill.

JACKIE

He's a director.

GEORGE

(to Attendant)

Do I need a ticket for this?

ATTENDANT

We'll remember you.

POPE

as they move to take his Porsche.

POPE (CONT'D)

(shaking his head)

I'll park it.

GEORGE

(to Jill)

What does he direct besides

traffic?

JILL

Ha, ha.

GEORGE

Television or movies?

JILL

Commercials.

JACKIE

(quietly, to George)

Feel better? Let's go.

GEORGE

(to Jackie)

Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern.

Look at her hair.

JACKIE

What about it?

GEORGE

Looks like somebody took a dump in

it, that's the worst color job I've

--

NORMA

George --

GEORGE

(pointing to her hair)

Baby, you've been chippying on me --

NORMA

Yes, isn't it awful --

GEORGE

(smiling)

-- yes.

JACKIE

We're upstairs, George. Now come

on. Behave yourself, and for

Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't

let me drink too much.

GEORGE

(going upstairs)

You don't do that anymore, do you?

WAITER

Can I get you folks something?

JILL

A stinger, please.

POPE

A tomato juice.

GEORGE

I'll take a -- some white wine.

WAITER

And you, madam?

JACKIE

(searching the room)

Oh I'll uhh -- just a coke.

LESTER

George, glad you could make it,

son. Hi, doll.

JACKIE

Lester, this is my friend Jill and

this is Johnny Pope.

LESTER

Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.

LESTER

Who are they?

JACKIE

(quickly)

Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told

you about Jill a hundred times,

Lester, you never remember anything

I say.

LESTER

Does she know about us?

JACKIE

Jesus, she's my best friend.

LESTER

Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?

JACKIE

I don't know. Why don't you ask

him?

LESTER

C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying --

George --

LESTER (CONT'D)

-- do me a favor, kind of keep your

eye on Jackie, she's a little high

strung tonight --

GEORGE

-- yeah?

LESTER

See she doesn't drink too much.

LESTER (CONT'D)

See you later, doll.

FELICIA

George, darling.

GEORGE

(without batting an eye)

Hey, baby, what's happening. Oh

this is Jackie. Jackie, say hello

to Felicia.

JACKIE

(also without batting an

eye)

Hello, Felicia.

FELICIA

(instantly suspicious of

George)

... hello.

FELICIA (CONT'D)

I'm so glad you could make it. I've

been looking forward to seeing you.

MAN

Lester, what the fuck do you think

you're doing?

LESTER

Jesus, Nate, I'm sorry.

NATE

Never mind, I'll do it myself.

LESTER

So far so good.

NATE

Aw there's nothing to worry about.

LESTER

You never know.

FELICIA

Why didn't you come alone? Lester

invited you. Did you have to bring

her?

GEORGE

(looking toward Lester)

Well she...

FELICIA

She what?

GEORGE

She's a friend of Jill's.

FELICIA

And who's Jill?

GEORGE

Well, she's a friend of Johnny

Pope's -- you know, the director.

FELICIA

Oh.

JACKIE

No thanks.

KENNETH

Excuse me, I know I know you, but I

can't think where.

GEORGE

Look, I'd like to help but --

FELICIA

There you are.

GEORGE

Wait a minute --

POPE

This other couple that we're here

with, do you know them very well?

JILL

Well... sure...

POPE

Then maybe you can tell me why

George would be going into the

ladies room.

JILL

George? Was he alone?

POPE

I don't think so.

JILL

Well did he go in there with

Jackie?

JILL (CONT'D)

That bastard.

POPE

George is a hairdresser, isn't he?

GEORGE

(desperate)

Baby, you gotta let me out of here.

FELICIA

Sweetheart, it's a bore out

there... let's lock the door.

GEORGE

Holy Christ. You want to get us

killed?

FELICIA

Don't be silly. I'll just tell

Lester we were smoking a couple of

joints. See?

LESTER

-- fellas, fellas, just listen, you

both have tidelands, you both want

Uncle Sam to come through with

offshore drilling permits -- so do

it together --

WOMAN

So, little red riding hood says 'my

what big teeth you have and the

wolf says all the better to eat you

with, my dear, and she says -- eat,

eat, eat, doesn't anybody ever fuck

any more?'

GEORGE

Don't do it.

JACKIE

That son of a bitch, everything he

says is a phony piece of shit, what

does he think, I'm some cigar butt

he's got between his teeth --

GEORGE

(almost picking her up)

C'mon, cunt, you're going for a

walk.

JACKIE

He just completely ignores me. He

could have at least said something,

introduced me or something.

GEORGE

Sweetheart, you're drunk.

JACKIE

Oh God, what do I want, George?

LESTER

Hi, doll, what's wrong?

JACKIE

You know what's wrong.

FELICIA

Lester --

LESTER

Oh, Felicia, there you are, you

know George and uh -- uh --

JACKIE

Jackie Shawn.

LESTER

Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi --

Felicia.

FELICIA

We've met.

JACKIE

Yes.

GEORGE

Well anyway...

LESTER

(to Felicia)

Your hair looks -- well fabulous.

FELICIA

That's George.

LESTER

It's just -- fabulous.

(to George, an attempt at

levity)

Think you could do anything for me?

GEORGE

(he takes it seriously)

Well -- I could try. Do you wash

your hair every day?

LESTER

Isn't that bad for it?

GEORGE

No it keeps the skin peeling.

You've got to keep the follicles

open. You lose hair and the skin

grows over the follicle and that's

how you lose it.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

This really ought to be layered...

LESTER

Layered?

GEORGE

Well yeah, otherwise it just sort,

you know, lies there -- layer so it

kind of fluffs out --

POPE

I think they're waiting for

somebody to start dinner.

LESTER

Have they sat down?

POPE

Everybody but us.

FELICIA

They're waiting for you, Lester.

IZZY SOKOLOFF

(to Jill)

I guess it's almost impossible to

get work in the business these

days.

JILL

Well, commercials. I read for a

soap the other day.

IZZY

A soap?

JILL

A daytime soap opera.

IZZY

And?

JILL

I was too old.

IZZY

What was it, somebody's daughter?

JILL

Somebody's mother.

JACKIE

Waiter!

JACKIE (CONT'D)

One word out of you and I'll gargle

with it.

SID ROTH

Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn?

JACKIE

Not for rubber chicken, no.

SID ROTH

(intime)

Well maybe I can get you something.

JACKIE

That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.

SID ROTH

Sid.

JACKIE

Sid. You must be a very important

executive.

SID ROTH

(almost a whisper)

Well, whatever I am, I think I can

get you whatever you'd like.

JACKIE

You do?

SID ROTH

Yes.

JACKIE

(same tone as Sid's)

-- well, more than anything else --

(indicating George)

-- I'd like to suck his cock.

LESTER

(to East)

-- Senator, you should've seen

those little kids! About forty of

'em, all blind. We put out these

mattresses on the front lawn and

they came running out of the house,

tripping and falling all over the

place, having a hell of a good

time. I mean they were blind of

course. But it really gave you a

feeling of accomplishment. I tell

you I never had such a good time.

FELICIA

Lester --

SENATOR

-- let me understand this was

exclusively a home for blind

children --

FELICIA

Lester --

LESTER

-- yes, Senator -- just a minute,

dear --

FELICIA

Lester, don't you think that uhh --

FELICIA (CONT'D)

That girl's making an awful

spectacle of herself.

LESTER

(angry himself)

What do you expect me to do about

it?

FELICIA

I just thought you'd like to know --

LESTER

Why would I like to know if there's

nothing I can do about it,

goddammit --

OTHER VOICE

Quiet! Cranston's on.

JILL

-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --

POPE

-- oh I don't know --

JACKIE

(arm around George's

shoulders tonguing his

ear)

-- Just get me out of here, baby. I

can't stand it. It's killing me.

GEORGE

(indicating head table)

-- we can't now.

JACKIE

-- why not? C'mon, take me out of

here, somewhere I don't have to lie

to anybody and I'll fuck your

brains out, you little fiend, I

adore you --

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(plaintive)

-- don't you want to --

GEORGE

Jackie, can we --

JACKIE

(a little louder)

Who's the greatest cocksucker in

the world? C'mon --

GEORGE

(very quietly)

-- you are.

JACKIE

Fuckin' A --

LESTER (CONT'D)

Senator, excuse me a moment --

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Now, Jackie --

JILL

(trying for aplomb)

-- she's a very compulsive girl.

POPE

I can see that.

LESTER

(a desperate smile)

Hello, George. Your friend feeling

a little under the weather?

JACKIE

(to Lester)

-- you phony asshole --

LESTER

(as if he didn't hear it)

Oh, dear that's too bad.

(with quiet desperation,

to George)

-- get her out of here, get her out

of here.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(to Sid)

What was that?

SID ROTH

Illinois.

LESTER

(doesn't know what he's

saying)

-- oh, good.

GEORGE

Jackie, c'mon --

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I've got to get her out of here.

JILL

-- go ahead.

GEORGE

-- well aren't you --

JILL

-- what?

(indicating Pope)

-- I'll see you later...

GEORGE

(not liking it too much)

-- okay --

(pointed)

-- I'll see you later. Your house.

JACKIE

(finally)

-- gee...

GEORGE

-- what?

JACKIE

(she sits up, lights a

cigarette)

I don't know what gets into me.

GEORGE

You were great.

JACKIE

No, I blew it, I blew it with

Lester.

GEORGE

No you didn't.

JACKIE

You don't think so? I do.

GEORGE

You were great.

JACKIE

You always say that... I really

care for Lester, don't I?

GEORGE

That sounds like me.

JACKIE

I am you, you little bastard.

JACKIE(CONT'D)

Where do you want to go?

GEORGE

Sammy's?

JACKIE

He still having parties?

GEORGE

He never stopped.

ROSALIND

... and so... to have this man...

here... among us... who has

helped... as has everyone here to

bring so many people together... of

all races, creeds, and colors...

FELICIA

Lester.

LESTER

Yes, sweetheart, shh.

FELICIA

-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --

LESTER

-- what, who? Oh she's very nice,

yes -- I mean normally ---

FELICIA

-- cause she's going to be very,

very expensive.

LESTER

Can't we go into this later,

sweetheart?

ROSALIND'S VOICE

Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator

Joe East.

FELICIA

We cannot go into this later.

LESTER

That's okay too.

FELICIA

You make me sick. Just be straight

for once in your life.

QUICK CUT TO:

SENATOR

-- this tells of the ancient

grandmother who, upon seeing the

garden gate of her childhood, stops

a moment and says, hello garden

gate, hello garden gate, garden

gate, hello.

LESTER

(finally exasperated)

-- look, Felicia, this party

involves more than you and me, you

know. These people are concerned

about more than each other, you

know.

FELICIA

-- is that right?

LESTER

-- yes, we're all trying to do

something to make this a better

country to live in, believe it or

not.

FELICIA

(glancing up)

-- is that what this is all about?

LESTER

Yes and you don't have to be

sarcastic about it, that's a

beautiful thing he's doing -- some

people do more than go to the

beauty parlor and shop at Saks --

FELICIA

Lester, you're a miserable man.

You're not helping anybody. You're

just twisting arms to raise money

for a lot of silly son of a bitches

that are out for themselves -- this

is just business, don't kid

yourself. And you know the worst

thing about it, even if it does

somebody some good somewhere which

I can't possibly imagine, you'll

never know the difference. You're

just sweating and kidding yourself

- and you're kidding yourself if

you think your new business partner

is going to keep his hands off that

girl -- or that she'll keep her

hands off him.

LESTER

(he turns like a shot)

What are you talking about?

FELICIA

(she laughs)

-- think what you have time to

think, Lester.

LESTER

What are you talking about,

Felicia?

DET. YOUNGER

Excuse me, Senator. Ladies and

gentlemen, we're going to have to

evacuate this room as quietly and

quickly as possible. There's

nothing to worry about. We'd like

you to exit through the door here

on my left... down the steps into

the street, please!

JILL

-- here I am. Now what?

POPE

Well -- as I see it we've got two

choices. We can hang around here

and wait for the bomb to go off, or

we can go to my party.

JILL

Let's do that.

LESTER

-- have they located it?

LESTER (CONT'D)

(looking toward driver)

-- oh, sorry.

ONE OF THE SECURITY MEN

What was that all about?

GEORGE

What are you looking at?

JACKIE

The lawn -- it looks like it goes

on forever, doesn't it?

GEORGE

-- yeah.

JACKIE

-- look, you don't have to

entertain me...

GEORGE

(a slight laugh)

Am I entertaining you?

JACKIE

We're friends.

GEORGE

-- sure.

JACKIE

-- well, if you feel like playing,

go play...

JACKIE (CONT'D)

-- there's a lot of players in

there --

TWIN ONE

George!

TWIN TWO

George!

GEORGE

(pleasantly)

Hey, what's happening.

TWIN ONE

We're going to the jacuzzi.

TWIN TWO

Right now.

TWIN ONE

(tugging)

C'mon with us --

GEORGE

In the jacuzzi?

TWIN TWO

Sure, why not?

TWIN ONE

Come on, George --

GEORGE

No, later, maybe -- go ahead, I'll

catch up with you --

(they head off)

I've got --

RED DOG

Where the fuck you been, Jackie?

London?

JACKIE

-- no.

RED DOG

Real good to see you, man.

JACKIE

So what's been going on, Red Dog?

RED DOG

Hey, it's the same old shit, ain't

it? No matter where you go, it's

the same old shit. Nothing ever

changes, nothing, man, nothing.

(with sudden intensity)

Hey -- you ever been to Cuuliacaan?

GEORGE

-- where'd you go?

JACKIE

-- oh I thought you were --

GEORGE

-- what?

JACKIE

Nothing.

RED DOG

Hey, man, what's happening?

GEORGE

Nothing.

RED DOG

That's right, man!

DEPUTY

-- we can't find a thing, Mr.

Karpf.

LESTER

(turns to him)

Can't find what?

DEPUTY

No bomb.

LESTER

-- oh -- well that's good, isn't

it?

DEPUTY

(he's serious)

It's good if there's no bomb. If

there is a bomb and we can't find

it, that's not good.

LESTER

No of course not.

POPE

(coming up to Jill)

-- we're going to be here all

night.

JILL

-- why?

POPE

-- these bastards have me hemmed

in.

LESTER

(to Jill)

-- what's the problem, honey?

JILL

-- his car. They have it blocked.

LESTER

Oh that's no problem.

(to Deputy)

-- take care of this boy's problem,

will you, Gene?

DEPUTY

-- sure.

LESTER

-- listen, I wonder if you kids

could give me a ride? I'm kind of

stranded here.

JILL

Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.

LESTER

Everything okay, son?

POPE

Terrific. Now all I have to do is

find my car keys.

JILL

-- I'll get in the back --

LESTER

-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...

JILL

-- there's not much room --

LESTER

That's fine --

LESTER

See, nothin' to it.

LESTER (CONT'D)

What did you say your name was,

sweetheart?

JILL

Jill.

LESTER

(not moving his head)

Jill.

JILL

(trying to be casual)

-- yes, Jill.

LESTER

(still holding her)

Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.

JILL

(very uncomfortable)

Thank you.

LESTER

(fondling her head, moving

her closer)

-- just wonderful.

POPE (CONT'D)

(another irritant)

Oh, no shit.

POPE (CONT'D)

Hi, what are we doing?

JILL

Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride

home and I said we'd take him. Do

you mind?

POPE

(furious)

Of course not.

LESTER

Call me Les.

POPE

Where to, Les?

LESTER

Oh, say, how would you kids like to

stop off for a drink?

POPE

Well we'd love to, but we're going

to another party.

LESTER

Well... that's wonderful -- I'll

stop by there for a drink.

JACKIE

(lazily)

-- very nice, very nice.

GEORGE

(yes)

-- mmm --

JACKIE

-- but you never were much of a tit

man --

GEORGE

Mmmm --

JACKIE

-- ass and legs --

GEORGE

Look who's talking.

JACKIE

Me?

GEORGE

-- yes, you --

JACKIE

Well of course. Who loves a big

fanny on a man?

GEORGE

Not me, pal.

LESTER

Whose place is this?

SAMMY

Sure I know Jill.

POPE

(noticing)

-- the bar's in there, Les.

LES

(embarrassed)

-- oh, fine.

LESTER

(a little lamely,

indicating drink)

... I'm...

JILL

-- so what's new, Red Dog?

RED DOG

Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's

the same old shit wherever you go,

nothing ever changes.

POPE

Jill, scraves is a --

LESTER

(whispering)

-- how's it going?

MAN WITH PIPE

(quietly)

-- just fine.

LESTER

(squinting to see)

-- is that Illinois?

MAN WITH PIPE

(taking a good look at

Lester, then)

No, that's Sally.

LESTER

(dumbly)

-- Sally?

MAN WITH PIPE

(pointing with his pipe

stem to a girl by

Lester's ear, also

watching the set)

-- Sally.

JILL

-- so when are you going to Egypt?

POPE

You mean when are you going to

Egypt?

JILL

Now I didn't mean that, you rat.

POPE

Two weeks from tomorrow.

JILL

You're going?

POPE

You're going.

JILL

You're kidding.

POPE

Those Arabs won't be when they

start chasing you around the sand

dunes.

JILL

(laughing)

Johnny!

(she hugs him)

Why didn't you tell me before?

POPE

-- just before I ask you out? I

can't do that. Let's get out of

here before good old Les catches up

with us again.

JACKIE

What's wrong?

GEORGE

-- do you want ice?

JACKIE

-- no.

GEORGE

(finally)

-- we're kidding ourselves.

JACKIE

(staring right back)

-- we are?

GEORGE

-- last night I dreamt I was fifty

years old and Mary told me I was

supposed to meet Jill at the shop.

It seared me shitless.

JACKIE

Why?

GEORGE

I can't imagine being with Jill

when she's fifty years old. I can't

imagine not being with you.

JACKIE

-- but what about her? I don't want

to hurt Jill.

POPE

What's wrong?

JILL

We can't really leave that poor man

here alone.

POPE

-- he'll never know the difference.

JILL

-- still -- at least we should tell

him we're going. C'mon.

POPE

(going along with it,

protesting)

I'm telling you he won't know the

difference.

TWIN

(from Jacuzzi)

Hey.

TWIN (CONT'D)

-- it's getting soggy.

THE GUY WITH HER

-- just put it on the bench over

there and come on in.

LESTER

-- in there?

THE GUY

Sure.

TWIN

(meaning joint)

Could I have that?

LESTER

Say --

THE GUY

-- what is it now, man?

LESTER

Do you know where I can find a

towel?

THE GUY

-- the poolhouse.

JILL'S VOICE

-- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --

Les, we're leaving.

LESTER

Shhh --

(with genuine awe)

-- now that's what I call fucking.

JILL

-- what --

JILL (CONT'D)

(watching)

Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.

JILL (CONT'D)

(screaming)

You son of a bitch! You bastard!

GEORGE

Honey? Where've you been? We've

been looking everywhere for you.

JACKIE

(softly)

Oh God.

GEORGE

Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

-- Jesus --

JACKIE

-- well you better go after her.

GEORGE

-- shit...

(he grabs his shirt)

... wait here, honey --

TWIN ONE

George?

(to Twin Two)

Who was that?

TWIN TWO

Far out.

GEROGE

Jill, honey?

GEORGE

Hey, Red Dog. You seen Jill?

RED DOG

She just went out the door, man.

GEORGE

Jackie?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Jackie?

GEORGE

Jackie?

TWIN ONE

She went up to the house, George.

TWIN TWO

You're a trip and a half, man.

GEORGE

Hey... you seen... Jackie...

RED DOG

(pointing)

-- out the door, man.

GEORGE

(shouting)

Jackie!

GEORGE

(swaying in)

Jill... Jill... Jill.

OPERATOR'S VOICE

Jackie Shawn.

GEORGE

-- yeah, this is --

OPERATOR'S VOICE

-- yes, George.

GEORGE

I guess you haven't heard from her

yet.

OPERATOR'S VOICE

Not yet.

GEORGE

Okay... thanks...

DISSOLVE TO:

JILL

I don't want to fight, George.

GEORGE

I don't want to fight either.

Look... uh -- I love you.

JILL

Bullshit.

GEORGE

(moving to her, taking her

arm)

I do, Jill.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

How come you took your own car?

JILL

(getting a cigarette)

I didn't want him meeting me here.

GEORGE

Well that's something.

JILL

What is.

GEORGE

You didn't plan on fucking him

tonight.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You did fuck him, didn't you?

JILL

I'm very tired, George.

GEORGE

Didn't you, baby?

JILL

Let go of me.

JILL (CONT'D)

Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll

call the police.

GEORGE

Oh, Christ.

JILL

Oh, hi... listen, can I call you

back?... Yes... no, everything's

fine, really... bye.

GEORGE

That was him.

JILL

Yes.

GEORGE

You told him I was here and he

wanted to know if I was beating you

up.

JILL

Yes.

GEORGE

Well, did you get a job out of it

at least?

JILL

I'd like you to leave now.

JILL (CONT'D)

-- and take this with you.

GEORGE

Where did this come from?

JILL

Who knows, I'm sure you don't --

but if it'll help any, I found it

in your bed.

JILL (CONT'D)

(unsteadily)

So who else was there besides

Jackie? Huh?... huh?

GEORGE

Baby, don't do this. I do love you.

JILL

Obviously there were others,

weren't there?

GEORGE

Obviously.

JILL

How many?

GEORGE

What do you wanna know for?

JILL

I just want to know, that's all.

GEORGE

What difference does it make?

JILL

I just want to know while we were

seeing each other... I just don't

want girls looking at me and

knowing and me not knowing...

GEORGE

Baby, please don't... I love you.

JILL

(breaking away)

I don't want to be a fool!... I

want to look them in the eye and

say, I know!

GEORGE

(she's backing up, he's

trying to touch her)

Baby, don't do this --

JILL

(fighting for control)

-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.

GEORGE

-- please, baby --

JILL

-- no, it'll help me, really --

GEORGE

How?

JILL

I'll know you've lied to me... all

along. I'll know you're incapable

of... love... that'll help me...

not now, but eventually.

GEORGE

You dumb cunt, everybody fucks

everybody, grow up, for Christ's

sakes. You're an antique, you know

that? Look around you -- all of

'em, all these chicks they're all

fucking, they're getting their hair

done so they can go and fuck,

that's what it's all about. Come

into the shop tomorrow and I'll

show you -- I fucked her, and her,

and her, and her, and her -- I

fucked 'em all!... That's what I

do, I fuck. That's why I went to

beauty school, to fuck. I can't

help that, they're there and I do

their hair and sometimes I fuck

'em. I stick it in and I pull it

out and that's a fuck, it's not a

crime.

JILL

... well I'm glad you told me.

GEORGE

(his eyes closed)

Jesus.

JILL

I am... I mean, you know, that's...

GEORGE

What? What? What? What? What?

JILL

... honest. At least you're honest

with me.

GEORGE

Does it make you happy?

JILL

I wish you'd go now.

GEORGE

That's all you've got to say?

JILL

-- yes.

GEORGE

-- tell me something -- did you

talk about me?

JILL

George...

GEORGE

Did you?

JILL

Please!... that's not like you.

GEORGE

Yeah, I know. Did you?

JILL

George, now cut this out.

GEORGE

Did you?

JILL

Stop it.

GEORGE

Did you?

JILL

Yes, yes, I did.

GEORGE

What did you say?

JILL

George, if you keep this up I'm

going to scream.

GEORGE

What did you say?

JILL

George...

GEORGE

What did you say?

JILL

I said you were a loser!

GEORGE

No, I'm not a loser, baby, I just

sort of break even.

LESTER

(to the other two)

Wait outside, would you?

LESTER (CONT'D)

You live like a pig.

GEORGE

Yeah.

(Lester doesn't answer)

How long have you been here?

LESTER

(looking it)

All night.

GEORGE

Well... who are those guys?

LESTER

What do they look like?...

GEORGE

Look, Lester... are you unhappy

with me about something?

LESTER

Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about

something.

GEORGE

Well, what?

LESTER

Godammit, George...

GEORGE

Now wait a minute...

LESTER

Sit down.

GEORGE

But...

LESTER

I said sit down!

MAN

Everything all right?

LESTER

I'll call you, it's okay.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Now, George, I want to hear it from

you. Either you admit it, man to

man, to my face or I'll have him

pound it out of you, and he does a

hell of a job, believe me.

GEORGE

I believe you...

LESTER

I wanna hear about it.

GEORGE

Oh Jesus Christ.

LESTER

I wanna hear about it, George.

GEORGE

Hey, have 'em put me away, or

whatever you're gonna do, okay?...

I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired

to tell the truth... I'm too tired

for anything.

LESTER

I wanna hear about it.

GEORGE

What can I say!

LESTER

I wanna know your thinking, I wanna

know how someone like you thinks.

Did you think you could get away

with it, did you think you could

put something over on me? Does a

guy like you get his kicks sneaking

around behind people's backs and

taking advantage of them? Maybe

that's your idea of being anti

Establishment!

GEORGE

I'm not anti-Establishment.

LESTER

That's got nothing to do with it...

You're so beyond my comprehension I

can't even discuss it with you.

GEORGE

Then don't... just have 'em beat me

up or whatever you're gonna do.

LESTER

No, not yet, not yet. You worry

about it for a while, I've been

worrying all night, now you can

worry.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Was it me, did you have something

against me?

GEORGE

What, do you think I planned it?

LESTER

Did they have something against me?

GEORGE

Didn't they tell you?

LESTER

I wanna hear it from you!

GEORGE

(agonized)

... how am I gonna tell you what

they have against you?

I mean Jesus fucking Christ,

they're women, aren't they? Have

you ever listened to women talk,

man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til

it's fucking coming out of my ears.

I'm on my feet all day, every

fucking day, listening to women

talk and you know what they talk

about, don't you? Being fucked up

by some guy. That's all that's on

their minds. I'm sure you've done

something they could get pissed off

about, what's that got to do with

it? All women are pissed off, man,

all of 'em. They fucking hate us!

Don't you know that?

LESTER

... yes, I follow your thinking on

that.

GEORGE

We're always trying to fuck them...

they know it and they like it and

they don't like it... that's just

how it is... look, it's got nothing

to do with you, man. It just

happened. Felicia's got nothing to

do but shop and get her hair done

and she knows she's getting

older... her daughter hates her,

what's she going to do, go to PTA

meetings?

LESTER

Do you think Lorna hates her? I

don't think she hates her. I mean

she may resent her a little...

GEORGE

Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates

her.

LESTER

Why, why do you think that is?

GEORGE

Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I

know?

LESTER

Well, I don't know.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(to George)

Want a drink?

GEORGE

No thanks.

LESTER

Have a drink.

GEORGE

Okay, thanks.

LESTER

You don't have a clean glass in the

house.

GEORGE

I know.

LESTER

(talking to himself)

I'll have to wash one out.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Jesus, what a way to live. I never

lived like this, not even when I

was your age, not even when I never

had a dime.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Hell of a way to treat a business

partner, that's all I can say.

GEORGE

Who?

LESTER

Me!

GEORGE

Hey, you were never going to give

me the money.

LESTER

(after a moment)

I was gonna give you the money.

Probably I was. Shit, I don't know,

I don't know anything anymore.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I tell you, you never know... you

just never know... one minute

you're here and the next... I mean

a man at my age, how long have I

got -- ten years? Five years? I

wish I knew... what I was living

for.

LESTER (CONT'D)

... You can lose it all; you can

lose it all no matter who you

are... I don't know, what's the

point of having it all. Look at me.

I don't have a goddam thing... the

market's terrible right now, went

down ten points last week, goddam

Lyndon Johnson!

GEORGE

Oh yeah...

LESTER

Yeah,, it goes up a little and then

it goes down, maybe Nixon will do

something. What's the difference,

they're all a bunch of jerks. I

wouldn't let 'em run my business, I

can tell you that much. Not if I

had any choice in the matter.

(after a moment)

I don't know what to do with you. I

don't know, I don't know what's

right or wrong anymore.

GEORGE

I don't either, Lester, I swear to

you I don't.

LESTER

(suddenly)

What about Jackie?

GEORGE

What about her?

LESTER

I mean, how did that happen?

GEORGE

Lester, it just happened.

LESTER

She's nothing but a whore.

GEORGE

No --

LESTER

Just a whore, I go over there, have

a few drinks and get my gun off.

I'm through with her, she's nothing

but a whore.

GEORGE

No, man, no. You can say

everybody's a whore. She's okay. I

mean Jackie'll fuck around but not

that much. Somewhere she really

likes you, Lester, and it's not

just the bread. She's okay.

LESTER

You really think so?

GEORGE

Yes I do.

LESTER

I'm finished with her.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Oh, by the way, I think you oughta

know -- Lorna thinks she's got the

clap.

GEORGE

What?

LESTER

Yeah, the clap. That's what she

thinks. But who knows -- I don't

know.

LESTER (CONT'D)

I don't know anything anymore.

LESTER (CONT'D)

(to hoods)

Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.

LESTER (CONT'D)

Just having a little fun, George...

(to hoods)

Go on home.

(to George)

I'll call you later about the shop.

I'm beat. God, I'm beat.

NORMAN

You're late, George.

GEORGE

Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you?

And if you don't reach her, keep

trying.

DEVRA

(on desk)

Mrs. Shumann and Mrs. Young are

waiting. Mrs. Young is kind of

p.o.'d.

GEORGE

Where's Mary?

DEVRA

She hasn't showed up yet.

GEORGE

(grumbling something under

his breath, then:)

Norman!

(to Devra)

Devra, I asked you to call Jackie.

Call her.

DEVRA

(perturbed)

All right.

NORMAN

What!

GEORGE

Somebody's going to have to wash

Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.

NORMAN

You do it.

GEORGE

(he's had about enough)

Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo

girl.

NORMAN

You are today.

MRS. SHUMANN

Temper, temper, George.

GEORGE

Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary-

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Mary! Get over here!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Mary, where were you yesterday?

Huh?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You ran out on me and you left it

like a goddamn pig pen.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk?

Look, I've had a rough night, one

of the roughest I've ever had, now

I'm not in the mood for any sulking

bullshit, what's wrong? Are you

sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?

MARY

Otis is dead.

GEORGE

-- Otis?

MARY

My son Otis. He was killed in

Vietnam. They done phoned me at the

shop yesterday.

GEORGE

Oh, Mary.

MARY

-- you shouldn't talk to me like

that no matter what, George... you

know better...

GEORGE

-- oh -- sweetheart...

MARY

-- you shouldn't do me like that...

GEORGE

(hugging her)

-- please, please forgive me...

MARY

(crying)

-- you know better...

GEORGE

(after a moment)

-- why did you come in today?

MARY

-- left my bag, didn't have no

money...

GEORGE

-- how did you get here?

MARY

-- took a bus.

GEORGE

-- c'mon, I'll get you home...

JACKIE'S VOICE

-- just a minute, you're early --

GEORGE

-- good afternoon --

JACKIE

-- you've got to leave.

GEORGE

I've got to leave?

JACKIE

-- yes, honey, you've got to get

out of here.

GEORGE

Why?

JACKIE

Lester's on his way.

GEORGE

Where are you going?

JACKIE

Please, we'll have to talk later --

GEORGE

Look about last night --

JACKIE

(exasperated but not

unkind)

Forget about last night, it's okay,

we'll talk when I get back --

GEORGE

It's not okay, I mean we've got to

talk now. Where are you going?

JACKIE

Look -- either you leave or I leave

because I don't want the two of us

here when Lester arrives. I just

don't --

JACKIE (CONT'D)

My God that's him --

GEORGE

-- It's Malone's.

JACKIE

That's it, then I'm leaving.

CLEANER

Cleaners.

GEORGE

Pull over, pull over!

JACKIE

(looking below her)

You're going to kill me.

GEORGE

No --

JACKIE

(turning to him,

imploring)

Well then what are you trying to do-

GEORGE

I want to marry you. I want to take

care of you and I want your

children, and I want you to be my

girl. That's all I want. That's all

I want out of my life, and it's a

lot.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Look, I don't know if I'll ever

make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but

I'll take care of you, I'll make

you happy, I swear to God I will.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for

God's sake, answer me.

JACKIE

If you knew how many times I wanted

to hear you say that...

GEORGE

So I'm saying it...

JACKIE

It's too late...

GEORGE

What's too late about it? Look,

we're not dead, are we? That's the

only thing that's too late.

JACKIE

Lester's left Felicia. He's taking

me to Acapulco on the five o'clock

flight. He's asked me to marry him.

GEORGE

So what? You don't love him, do

you? Answer me.

JACKIE

What's that supposed to mean?

GEORGE

I don't know... Jackie?

JACKIE

What?

GEORGE

I don't trust... anyone... but

you...

JACKIE

Oh my baby...

JACKIE (CONT'D)

God, there's Lester...

GEORGE

Don't go, Jackie...

JACKIE

I can't just let him stand by the

door...

GEORGE

Don't leave me...

JACKIE

I've got to... I've got to tell him

where I am.

GEORGE

What for?

JACKIE

I don't know -- I've got to.
