tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five

CAM

That was really cool.  It was like... watching "Cops".

TED

He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc.

CAM

You know, I don't want to bitch or anything, but you

were supposed to take me along on that one.

TED

Couldn't find you.

CAM

I know you know this, but the sooner they think I can

handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you

back down south.

TED

I've been hearing that for 13 months and six days,

Cam.  After a while, it gets a little old.

Next time, okay.

PAUL

That's... quite the fish.

BRANCH

Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.

BRANCH (cont'd)

Mr. Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life

insurance policy.

TED

Raymond, isn't it?

PAUL

Yes, Raymond.  You see, as I've already explained to

Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I

thought it might be time to... move on.

TED

By move on you mean...?

BRANCH

...cash in Raymond's policy.

PAUL

I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive.

My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after

each other if anything should ever happen.  And to

be frank, money's a little --

TED

I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no

actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must

be missing for seven years before he or she can be

legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an

investigation period where concerned parties can

take up to another year to file interventions

concerning the motion.  So, even though your

brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's

really very little we can do for you.

BRANCH

Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.

TED

Oh, absolutely.

TIFFANY

(into her headset)

Psychic Pals.  How are you today... Mr. Williams?

(pause - she listens)

Well, we are all registered psychics here.  I just had

a feeling you'd be calling.  What's up?

TED

Hey Tiff.

TIFFANY

(to caller)

Your TV remote control?  Okay.

TIFFANY (cont'd)

I need you to clear your mind...

TED

"If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the

rain.  If you're not into...something brownish."

TIFFANY

It's stew.  I'm not sure it's still good.

TED

Aren't you with a customer?

TIFFANY

They're concentrating.

TED

(through a mouthful of food)

So?  How's the tea leaf business today?

TIFFANY

I've decided from now on to ignore you when you're

ignorant about my work.  And it's going very well

thank you.

(reconnecting to the caller)

Mr. Williams, I'm seeing sofa cushions.  Do you have

a sofa?  Good.  Glad I could help.

TED

You here from that software distributor guy?

TIFFANY

No, but I did crack that code problem.  You know how

sometimes when you're running Beta versions you --

TED

English, please.

TIFFANY

There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it.

(another call comes in)

Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?  Now I

thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not

specifically in your coffee pot.

TED

Jeez, Tiff.

TIFFANY

Jeez, Ted.  Do I tell you how to do your job?

TED

(kidding... kind of)

No, but then again I'm not a computer aided pseudo

psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence...

TIFFANY

Before you say anything else that may keep us from

having sex ever again, let me ask you something...

TED

Tiff, please.  I always get these wrong.

TIFFANY

That's why we keep trying.  Now, Love is Sacrifice

test.

(reading)

If you were in a life raft with me and there was only

enough water --

TED

Don't you have a customer?

TIFFANY

(to the caller)

Carol?  God says he's busy with a famine right now,

but you should keep praying.  Cool.

TED

No.  I'm not doing it.

TIFFANY

It's just a stupid quiz.

TED

Exactly.

TIFFANY

Psychic Pals.  Is this the first time you've called us

Mrs...?

TIFFANY (cont'd)

But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential

relationship problems.

(to her caller)

Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is an anxious

day for you.

TED

Our only relationship problem is you're running a

$1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.

TIFFANY

Don't call it a scam.

(to the caller - startled)

Excuse me?

TED

What?

TIFFANY

You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret.

(to Ted - playful)

You didn't just call this your living room, did you?

TED

I meant ours.  Ours, ours, ours.

TIFFANY

I feel someone you really care about, maybe even

the love of your life, is being a real pain.  Now I need

you to concentrate...

AVIS

Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee?

PAUL

Thanks Avis.  Looks good.

PAUL (cont'd)

Was November this bad last year?

AVIS (O.S.)

Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk

about?  Did you send the computer back?

PAUL

Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls?

AVIS (O.S.)

Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.  I

told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some

people don't like to listen.

PAUL

Something... strange happened last night Avis.

AVIS (O.S.)

What was that?

PAUL

Did... you ever meet my brother Raymond?

AVIS (O.S.)

The one who went missing?

PAUL

Uh huh.  Well anyway last night there's a knock on

the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there

on the doorstep.

AVIS

Didn't you have him declared...?

PAUL

Dead?  No.  I mean, they said he hadn't been gone

long enough.

AVIS

(smiling warmly)

Good thing in hindsight.

AVIS (cont'd)

So where was he all these years?

PAUL

Lower 48.  Said he wanted to get away from the cold.

AVIS

Where 'bouts?

PAUL

(looking up)

Sorry, what was that?

AVIS

Where was he living?

PAUL

Florida.

AVIS

I've got an aunt down there.  Where 'bouts?

PAUL

(blanking)

A uh... small place.  By the beach.

AVIS

Well that's great.  You and Mrs. Barnell will have

some company for a bit I guess.  How is she?

PAUL

Better, a little better.  Some days are better than

others.

There's a little fridge down here.

Fine.  Sorry.

DETECTIVE BOYLE

(looking at the ridge)

If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while

conscious.  Did he say where he'd been living,

before he came home?

PAUL

Florida.  He didn't really talk about it much.  He

brought us this shell.

PAUL (cont'd)

It's really all we have left.  He'd been gone for five

years.  We'd given him up--

DETECTIVE BOYLE

--for dead, yes sir.

PAUL

How did you...?

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy.

(Paul shows no reaction)

Said he saw what looked like a body.  We tracked

you through his ID.

PAUL

Just like on TV.

PAUL (cont'd)

I've got to see him.  Please.

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Mr. Barnell,  I should warn you, an animal  attack isn't

pretty.  There's not much left.

DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)

Is that your brother, sir?

PAUL

They chewed his ears off.  What kind of animal does

something like that?

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the

feeding pattern indicate wolf.  It's rare, but it can

happen.

DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)

Your brother's personal effects.  We've got some

people with the victim's assistance program who

can help you through this.  Marcie?

FEMALE COP

Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the

ankle.

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Pups.  Must have been the whole freakin' pack.

Yup.

Nope.

Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome policy.

TIFFANY

Must be all this talk about using your wood.

TED

TIFFANY

Secret?

TED

My dirty talk sucks?

TIFFANY

I like it when you try, though.

TED

You know in some states they actually do this

outside?

TIFFANY

So how many insurance companies are there in the

United States?  Like, a billion.

TED

That's not the point, Tiff.  I've busted my ass for

Liberty Capital.  I don't want to quit.  I deserve to be

promoted out of this ice bound backwater.

TIFFANY

And when it happens, I guess I'll just be another

notch on your briefcase.

I can't believe you said that.  You know you are...

That's him.  Raymond Barnell.

TED

Could you?

CAM

Ouch.  That's gotta hurt.

TED

So what's your line on this?

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Just what it looks like.  Wolves got him. Maybe a

grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks.

TED

Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to

cash in his policy two weeks ago?

DETECTIVE BOYLE

You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his

brother's leg?

TED

Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious?

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.  We like

nice simple endings.

TED

But shouldn't you--

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but

I'm guessing it's your job

to find a way not to pay these poor people.

CAM

Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down

whatever leads we can find.

TED

Detective, we're an insurance company, not the

Salvation Army.

DETECTIVE BOYLE

Mind telling me what you're doing?

CAM

They gave every claims team a video camera last

quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on

litigation.  We had this case two months ago where

this mother of six was claiming...

Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.  Did you

see Mr. Barnell on the news last

night?  Last thing we need is bad P.R.  I don't want

this thing Valdeez-ing on us.

How sporty.  Was he a big hiker?

Not sure I follow.

Did he hike more than once a week?  Or was this a...

one time thing?

Sure.

PIZZA GUY

Absolutely.

TED

It wouldn't take much.

PIZZA GUY

Full disclosure to the pizza consumer. I'll be sure to

pass that along.

TIFFANY

Why you gotta argue with the service industry?

TED

The problem with people today is they don't expect

anyone to tell the truth.

We've just come to accept lying as acceptable.

If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic

Buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes

only."

Tiff, it has nothing to do with... look, just forget it.

What is with you anyway?

TED

cracking the biggest case of my career, one that

corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap.

Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend.

No, it's not your fault. I just want to live somewhere

where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza

doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled.

brother?

MRS. WHERRY

No.  Only saw him the once.  Never spoke.  Waved to

him.

TED

Waved?

MRS. WHERRY

He was clearing my driveway.  Raymond was a real

hellcat when he was younger.  But like they say, time

mellows even the hardest soul.

TED

gossip, but I think Raymond used to have a --

TED

Mrs. Wherry, I'm sorry, but --

MRS. WHERRY

Sorry.  Did Raymond like the outdoors.  Not so

much, no.  Liked living out here at the cabin, though.

I think he had some friends on the police force.

Have you talked to them?  They'd pull up here day

and night, always looking for --

I'm sorry, did you say you thought it was Paul who

Sorry.

Turns out our Mr. Barnell is mortgaged to the nuts.

His business is about one step

away from chapter 11.  Plus it's like his brother

Raymond never existed.  He's got no credit history,

no nothing for the last five years.

CAM

Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a

crime.  People around here have been known to

swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison.

Doesn't exactly leave a paper trail.

TED

Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace.  Plus, the

only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was

get some new ID and a new credit card.  Didn't

charge anything.

Wow.  Less than nothing.

It's something.

No it's not... in my humble, junior investigator's

opinion.

No, I doubt that.  They asked me to bring some

photos of Raymond.  Guess it's gonna be a pretty

big story.

So you're a souvenir wholesaler?

SPELLMAN

For the cruise ship trade, mostly.  Usual stuff, stuffed

animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals,

your whales, your walrus --

TED

They came in through there?

SPELLMAN

(looking up/duh!)

Yeah.  Through that... big hole in the roof.  I got a list

of all the things that are missing.

TED

How much?

SPELLMAN

Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof.

Now I know you guys are gonna bust my --

TED

Fax over your estimate.  We'll have you a check by

Friday.

CAM

(taking Ted aside)

Ted.  Maybe we should take a look at their inventory

list first?

TED

This is a simple case, Cam.  Bad guys, through roof,

stole stuff.  Let's clear it and get going.

SPELLMAN

I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were

holding for another company.  That could run

another couple of...

TED

Cam?  You wanna wrap this up?

Gotta go primary some time.

GARY (O.S.)

Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind.

MARGARET

So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both

GARY

I just came to look around, but she started yelling

and hitting me...

MARGARET

Oh please.

JIMBO

How the hell is this solving our problem?  How is

this stepping up?

GARY

It is now.

JIMBO

Where would we stash her?  Your place?

GARY

Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out

without anyone seeing.  And I've seen that sty you

call an apartment.

JIMBO

See, it's just a bad idea.

GARY

Yeah.  Maybe.

(a possible idea)

You see the whirlpool tub?

JIMBO

You can't be serious.

GARY

It could be like a little getaway.

PAUL (cont'd)

What are you people doing in my house?

GARY

Mr. Barnell.  You have something that belongs to us.

PAUL

I, I don't know what you're talking about.

JIMBO

Do you remember a dead man you found in the

dumpster behind your office?

PAUL

No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick

in my mind a... dead body.

GARY

Think hard Mr. Barnell.

GARY (cont'd)

Think hard.

know?  But you look like a pretty straight arrow.  So

then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.  Maybe

somehow our friend is worth some money to you.

GARY (cont'd)

So what'd you collect?

PAUL

We, we had a life insurance policy

on my brother.  It was for... 100,000 dollars.

GARY

You know, it's always you quiet guys.  Here's how it's

going to work.  We stay here with your wife, you go

get our guy.

PAUL

Here?

GARY

We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead.

Plus you'll have to explain

how you scammed the insurance people out of their

hard earned money.  We'll call you in three days.

Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our

trouble.  Screw with us, we start mailing your wife

back to you.

GARY (cont'd)

Starting with her feet.

Lady.  Please.

MARGARET

If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money...

we don't have that either.

GARY

It's none of your business what we want.

GARY (cont'd)

So how come you talk like you do?  I mean, cursing

all the time.

MARGARET

It's a disease.  It's called Tourette Syndrome.  I can't

control what I say.  Turnip.

GARY

Really?

MARGARET

You've taken a handicapped person hostage.  I hope

you're proud of yourself.

GARY

I saw this thing on TV where they said people with

that don't usually curse.

MARGARET

They must have got it wrong.

GARY

I don't think so.  It was a movie of the week based on

real events.  Don't most of Tourette's people twitch

and stuff?

GARY (cont'd)

(knowingly)

Oh, I get it.  You got a spice rack?

MARGARET

Over the sink.  And what's that supposed to mean?

GARY

Nothing.  Cumin?

MARGARET

On the left. (beat)  And I'm not... crazy, it's a physical

disease.  Sometimes I can control it, and

sometimes --

GARY

You can't?  Want to know what I think?  I think this

"syndrome" is something you

read about somewhere and figured, hey, works for

me.

MARGARET

Ass-rimming ball-sucker.

GARY

You can completely abdicate your societal

responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever

you want, and slough it off on a illness.  Maybe I

should catch this thing. "Gee, sorry Your Honor, I

have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."  It's

called really need a Slurpee disease.

MARGARET

You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit

eating fuck-weasel.  What kind of man threatens a

woman with a gun, anyway?

GARY

You are so faking it.

MARGARET

Oh, I'm faking it?  Is this how you get your kicks, you

over-compensating pussy little fart sack?

GARY

Hey!  Keep your voice down or the gag goes back.

MARGARET

You don't scare me.  If something bad was going to

happen, my psychic would have told me.

MARGARET (cont'd)

You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me,

I'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me.

Hello brother.

Raymond?  Is that...

RAYMOND

Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news

from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I

was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know,

despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.

PAUL

Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We

all thought you were...

RAYMOND

Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression.

PAUL

But you had dropped off the face of the earth.

RAYMOND

And you just decide to make it permanent?

PAUL

But there were no records of you anywhere.  I

checked.

RAYMOND

In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using

your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the

reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth

certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was

pretty pissed.

RAYMOND (cont'd)

But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.  He woulda

told 'em it's not me.  Unless...

Life insurance.

PAUL

Your money?

Fifty thousand.

Almost worth coming back for.  What's the split?  I

get half?

about a resolution in our claim?

TED

Mr. Barnell.  Why are you staying out here?

PAUL

My wife and I, we're having some problems.

TED

Kind of understandable I guess.  Seeing as how you

killed that man and dumped his body out in the

woods.

TED

No.  Not Raymond.  Definitely not Raymond.  I

thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing

me...

My tone, Mr. Barnell?  You are going to jail.  I will

personally see to that.

help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this

other thing?

PAUL

I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said

he was joking, but I... I think he might.

TIFFANY

Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other

someone else, the one you're trying to protect?

PAUL

(crying)

I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your

own life didn't even matter, as long as...

TIFFANY

(touched)

Listen to me, Carlos.  Your wife is an incredibly lucky

woman.  I know, relationships are tough, but you do

what you gotta do to keep it together, okay?

Remember, love is sacrifice.

PAUL

I guess you're right.

TIFFANY

Now you get tough.  And remember, this call is for

entertainment purposes only.  Call me back and let

me know how it goes.

PAUL

Margaret.  You know that Stockholm Syndrome

thing?

RAYMOND

The movie?

PAUL

When you fall in love with your kidnappers.

RAYMOND

Get the fuck out of here.

PAUL

I went by there.  She was in the bedroom with the big

one.

(quietly)

Not the first time, either.

(a flash of panic)

With other men, not kidnappers.

RAYMOND

For real?

PAUL

Her therapist.  And some guy she... hardly knew.

RAYMOND

Wow.  Sucks to be you.

PAUL

Shut up.

RAYMOND

I always knew she was a fucking tease.

PAUL

Yeah.  Guess you were right.

RAYMOND

Well, you want my opinion...

(Paul nods)

I don't trust her, Paul.  Never did.

PAUL

You think she'd... really mess things up?

RAYMOND

Only one way to make sure she doesn't.

PAUL

Not sure what you're saying?

RAYMOND

You remember that pooch Mom had?  Crazy little

Jack Russel with the bladder infection?

PAUL

Whole basement stank.

RAYMOND

Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's

misery.  And yours.

PAUL

You... You sure, Ray?

RAYMOND

Trust me, Bro'.  Leaky dogs, crazy women.  Two

Yes?

You've been with me for five years?  Paul?  Can we

make it Paul?

AVIS

Sure.  I just thought it was more professional when

people were around to call you Mr. Barnell.

PAUL (O.S.)

Avis.  There haven't been any people in here for

months.  No one comes in here, unless they're

looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish,

neither of which we carry.  So you can call me pretty

much anything you want and it won't impress the

customers at all because we don't have any.

AVIS

Are you OK, Paul?

PAUL

No Avis, to be frank I'm a little frazzled right now.

Great.  I was told to give you this.

PAUL (cont'd)

Disinterment order.  Got it from the coroner's office.

My brother didn't want to be buried.

ARNITH

How'd you know?

PAUL

Know what?

ARNITH

That he didn't want to be buried.

RAYMOND

He left it in a letter.

ARNITH

And you just got it now?

PAUL

Ya know, I don't mean to be rude here, but I'm not

sure this is any of your business.

ARNITH

That's entirely possible.

PAUL

I, I don't think this is anything to be flippant about.

ARNITH

I appreciate that, Sir.  But I'm on a union specified

break right now, which means you are talking to me

as a private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can

pretty much say whatever I want to. If

you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you

will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the

workers policy guide and recently ratified in our

latest collective agreement dated --

Sorry.  I'm just --

ARNITH

Trying to get your brother out of the ground. We

couldn't be more pleased.  You've arranged for

transportation of the remains?

RAYMOND

We're gonna take him to go.

BILL

See, now that's a problem.  We can't release the

body into your custody unless you are licensed by

the state to convey deceased persons.

ARNITH

Good point Bill.  Bill knows exhumation policy.  You

can look it up but I'm betting he's right.  You come

back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this.

PAUL

I'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now.

mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and

as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a

someone, I mean, really love someone...

TED

(between punches)

I want a fucking Hallmark card or the lyrics to a

Foreigner rock ballad, I'll go to the mall, Mr. Barnell.

Hey.

TED

Hey yourself.

TIFFANY

So where you want to go?

TED

Somewhere close.  My three o'clock's been moved

up.

TIFFANY

Cool.  You alright about everything?

TED

Yeah.  The life policy was written on his brother, and

he did, you know, die.  I may be rationalizing a bit, but

ethically I think I'm okay.

TIFFANY

Good.  I like it when you're okay.

TIFFANY (cont'd)

Don't ya just love this weather?

TED

Learning to.

MARGARET (V.O.)

Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much!

Wish you could have come.  Saw some dolphins

today.  Frisky little buggers.  They were even playing

our song in the bar.  Have been pondering about

your question, and I think my answer is "yes."  After

all, it's no fun in the sun without...

MARGARET (O.S.) (cont'd)

Paul, you ready?

PAUL

How you feeling?

MARGARET

Pretty damn good.

PAUL

I can tell.

MARGARET

Can you?

Fine.  We'll do it now.

DAVE'S WIFE

Watch the curb.

DAVE

Looks like weather.

FADE TO WHITE.
