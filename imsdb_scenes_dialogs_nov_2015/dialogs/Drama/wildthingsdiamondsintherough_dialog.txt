MARIE

Today's the day, Mom...

CURATOR (O.S.)

You here again, Marie?

MARIE

Just leaving.

MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS

Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing

RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

... operation, aimed at finally capturing

the Black Widow suspect after a six month

trail of embezzlement and fraud, once

again failed to snare its subject.

RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Blue Bay Police Detective Michael

Morrison was able to recover over

$400,000 in stolen money, but the

suspect, described as Female, between

eighteen and thirty, remains at large...

MARIE

I'm... so... sorry...

ELENA

You will be.

03/22/2004   3.

JENNY

(handing over a present)

Happy birthday, babe. They ain't

diamonds, but you're just gonna have to

wait for those...

MARIE

(unconvincing)

Thank you. Thank you so much...

JENNY

Are you OK, hon?

MARIE

I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's

just...that new girl...I almost hit her

in the parking lot...

JENNY

You mean the towel girl, the one who

transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You

know the only reason she's slinging

towels is 'cos it's court ordered...

MOSSTER

We're here today to address a growing

epidemic that affects all of you.

MOSSTER

National studies report sexual activity

among students at an all-time high.

03/22/2004   4.

MOSSTER

We'll see who's cheering when you've got

an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or

get slapped with a paternity suit...Or

arrested for date rape. But don't take my

word for it...

PRINCIPAL MOSSTER

Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to

tell you about the pitfalls first hand...

KRISTEN

Good morning, my name is Kristen

Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami

juvenile parole board, as some of you

already know...

KRISTEN

But that's not what brings me here today.

When I heard about Principal Mosster's

sex education program I thought I'd

volunteer my own personal story, in hopes

that you might learn from the mistakes I

made. Back in High school all I wanted to

do was get drunk, stoned and laid...

KRISTEN

By my junior year, my life was a blur of

cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every

night of the week...

ELENA

(through fake coughs)

...whore...

03/22/2004   5.

KRISTEN

And then, one night at some pathetic frat

party, someone slipped a roofie in my

drink...and raped me.

KRISTEN

There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't

crawl when I think of the violation and

humiliation I endured. I can promise you

that if you make the same kind of wrong-

headed choices I did, you'll be seeing

Dr. Borman...

CHAD

Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.

Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at

the police department, where my work has

helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.

Most teens like Ms. Richards never get

their lives together. The physical scars

may go away, but the emotional damage

stays forever.

MUDDY

That's not...what I think it is, is it?

ELENA

Whattchya think it is, bitch?

MUDDY

One of them...Parole leashes...

ELENA

Bingo.

MUDDY

So you can't, like, go more than ten

miles from the cop shop?

03/22/2004   6.

ELENA

Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.

CHAD

And as for the perpetrators of this

heinous act, even if you are still a

minor, you will be tried as an adult,

and, if convicted, you will do hard time.

CHAD

Are there any questions?

ELENA

(calling out)

Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.

KRISTEN

Ask away.

ELENA

When they found the scumbag who took your

precious flower of virginity, you sued

his sorry ass, right?

KRISTEN

Uh, no, actually, I was never able to

make a positive ID. All I remember was

his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in

my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll

never forget..."

ELENA

So what you're really saying is you

fucked for free...

PRINCIPAL MOSSTER

Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young

lady!

7.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Blue Bay High School would like to

welcome all participating diving teams

from the tri-county region...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

First up, district champion Marie

Clifford...

JAY

C'mon now baby, you can do it...

JENNY

Your stepfather's just got a lot invested

in the team.

JAY

(to Marie)

Just try to keep those legs together.

ELENA (O.S.)

Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen

Virgin.

03/22/2004   8.

JAY

Excuse me?

ELENA

You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in

Clifford construction?

JAY

I am, yes, but...

ELENA

I'd love to see one of your erections...

JAY

Nice take off, gotta work on the

landing...

MARIE

I can't do any better...

JAY

No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.

Only better...

ELENA

Bet you choke.

MARIE

What's your major malfunction?

ELENA

Just wanted to make a wager. Between best

friends.

9.

ELENA

You blow this dive, I get those diamonds

of yours.

MARIE

How'd you know about my inheritance?

ELENA

Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's

the day, right?

MARIE

And what, pray tell, are you willing to

wager when I win?

ELENA

I'll stay away from your stepfather. You

make it, I won't be your new stepmom

anytime soon. Whattya say?

MARIE

Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.

ELENA

Choke!

03/22/2004   10.

J

ENNY

What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that

one judge only gave you a 9.7?

MARIE

Nah. I'm cool.

JENNY

Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.

You got diamonds on the mind.

JAY (O.S.)

Have either of you seen my video camera?

JAY

I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...

JAY

Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass

to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.

03/22/2004   11.

JAY

She's become every inch of the woman her

Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is

now, Julie's looking down and smiling.

JAY

And that's why, on your eighteenth

birthday, Marie, I know your mother

wanted you to have...

JAY

... she wanted you to have... a wonderful

birthday party surrounded by all your

friends.

e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...

JAY

Please excuse me.

MARIE

Jay! What about my present?

MARIE

Jay?

e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in

JAY (O.S.)

It simply can't be done...

12.

JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

In all construction there's delays.

MR. BARAJAS

Four months is not a delay. It's a

disaster.

JAY

You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the

building is almost finished. Just give me

a week, two tops.

MR. BARAJAS

We are long past the negotiation stage.

MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)

For every day the building goes

unfinished, we'll take a finger...

CICATRIZ

Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the

eleventh day...

ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.

JAY

Marie! Shouldn't you be with your

friends?

03/22/2004   13.

MARIE

I was just...

JAY

(to Marie)

I'll be right there. With your gift...

just... wait outside, OK?

JENNY

So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue

Bay's richest bitch?

nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.

JENNY

Holy shit, who invited her?

MARIE

This is a private party...

ELENA

Don't mind me. I ain't here for your

stupid party.

MARIE

Get the hell outta here! NOW!

03/22/2004   14.

ELENA

Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?

MARIE

Stay away from my stepfather!

ELENA

Make me...

he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled

JAY (O.S.)

What the hell's going on here?

MARIE

This...trash is just looking for a meal

ticket...

ELENA

Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little

Marie now, huh?

JAY

Party's over.

MARIE

But...what about...my present...

JAY

I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off,

whydontcha?

03/22/2004   15.

JAY

(sotto)

Not enough. Just not enough...

J

AY

Hello? Anyone there?

JAY (CONT'D)

Fuck me...

ELENA (O.S.)

Any time. Any place...

JAY

What are you doing here?

ELENA

You promised to show me your erection...

03/22/2004   16.

JAY

Is that my...camera?

ELENA

Lighten up, Jay.

JAY

Enough's enough. I think it's time you

left.

ELENA

Is that any way to treat Marie's new best

friend?

JAY

You're best friends are you?

ELENA

Sure. We've been having sleepovers.

Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's

been teaching me about shopping, I've

been teaching her about giving mind

blowing head...

JAY

Gimme the camera back...

ELENA

Come get it.

03/22/2004   17.

ELENA

(slyly)

Ooopppps.

MARIE

(sotto)

It's present time.

MARIE

What the hell...

JAY

What are you doing here at this time of

night?

MARIE

I just...wanted to apologize for my

behavior earlier. I was out of line.

JAY

When we admit our mistakes we grow.

You've made an important step.

MARIE

So...what about my present?

JAY

Meet me at the Museum. Before school

tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep,

I'm gonna finish up here...

03/22/2004    18.

FADE TO BLACK:

JAY (O.S.)

You really think you're ready for your

inheritance?

MARIE

It was...it was what Mom wanted...

JAY

You're the only one who can open that

lock, but I'm the one with the key. She

wanted you to have the diamonds when you

were responsible enough to know what to

do with them...

M

MARIE

I'm...responsible...

JAY

Really? Underage drinking, prying into my

personal affairs, fighting...

MARIE

But they're mine. Mom left them to me.

JAY

They're yours when I say they're yours.

For the time being, I've got some major

problems at the construction site.

Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk

again when you've done some growing up.

M

03/22/2004    19.

JAY

Please, don't fight me on this.   We're

Team Clifford, remember?

MARIE

(without conviction)

Team Clifford...

MARIE

What the hell?

OFFICER ENTWISTLE

Mr. Clifford?

JAY

Can I help you, Officer?

OFFICER ENTWISTLE

You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.

JAY

There must be some mistake, this isn't

possible...

MARIE

Jay, what's going on?

AY

Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down

the station. This is outrageous...

03/22/2004   20.

JAY

I didn't do anything, I swear.

OFFICER ENTWISTLE

I'm afraid she's got a different story.

JAY

Who's 'she'?

KRISTEN

Elena.

KRISTEN

Could you tell me what happened?

ELENA

It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...

MORRISON

You understand the seriousness of this

allegation, young lady?

MORRISON

And you know that we'll leave no stone un-

turned in the investigation.

21.

MORRISON(CONT'D)

There'll be a battery of forensics tests

you'll have to take, humiliating stuff.

And background checks, digging up all

kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify

in court, face the man you're accusing...

MORRISON

You sure you want to go through with

this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk

away right now....

KRISTEN

Please, Detective, this isn't the right

time...

ELENA

I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?

KRISTEN

If you're telling the truth, you won't

find a more sympathetic ear...

ELENA

'If' I'm telling the truth...

KRISTEN

And if you're not, there's gonna be

trouble, you understand?

MORRISON

This is already trouble. The man you're

accusing happens to be a friend of mine,

and when the DNA tests prove you're lying

I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of

bricks, mark my words...

THEO

We're gonna sue their asses til time runs

backwards...

03/22/2004   22.

JAY

(to Marie)

You've gotta believe me, I would never,

could never do anything like this, you

know that don't you?

MARIE

We're team Clifford.

JAY

That's my girl.

MORRISON

Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...

MORRISON

(to Marie)

Would you mind waiting outside while me

and your stepdad have a little chat...

JAY

It's OK honey. Michael and I are old

pals...

JAY

How's the divorce treating you?

MORRISON

She's taken me for everything I'm worth.

I swear to God, I'm never trusting

another woman as long as I live.

heo intervenes...

THEO

This is most egregious, Detective, my

client has pressing matters at his

construction site. He can't afford to

waste time with this frivolous

nonsense...

03/22/2004   23.

MORRISON

(to Jay)

Look, we're taking her statement right

now, gonna run every forensic test in the

book. Guarantee the case'll come apart

like a $2 watch...

JAY

She had my camcorder. Recorded what

happened. It should still be at the

construction site. It'll clear my name...

MORRISON

You'll be outta here by tonight.

MARIE (ON PHONE)

I can't believe it, Jenny...It just

doesn't make sense...I mean, I know

Jay...I know he'd never...

MARIE

This can't be...

ELENA

No such word as 'can't'...

03/22/2004   24.

KRISTEN (O.S.)

Sexual predators often keep a trophy...

MORRISON

I'm sorry?

KRISTEN

Maybe he recorded the rape.

MORRISON

And maybe he didn't. We'll never know.

Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take

months to fix it.

MORRISON

We were never properly introduced.

Michael Morrison.

KRISTEN

Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was

just in town for a couple days checking

in on some parolees when all this went

down...

MORRISON

You think maybe you could lean on the

girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We

all know she's lying. With all this Black

widow shit going down, we just don't have

the time or manpower to...

03/22/2004   25.

KRISTEN

She might not be lying, you know.

MORRISON

What makes you think that?

KRISTEN

Just a look in her eye. I...I have some

experience...

MORRISON

What the hell?

CHAD

Gotcha...

MORRISON

What is it?

CHAD

Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.

I'd say we've got a rape on our hands,

Detective, but we won't know for sure

until we run the tests...

MORRISON

Fine. Just do it...

ELENA

You vampires really need five pints of my

blood? That's like an armful...

03/22/2004   26.

CHAD

It's standard procedure in a rape test.

Test for drugs and such...

ELENA

And such.

CHAD

We're going to need a urine sample. Do

you think you could fill this?

ELENA

From here?

HAD

If...you wouldn't mind...removing your

clothes. I'll leave the room, give you

some priv...

ELENA

Done. Next?

CHAD

Those are...

ELENA

Bite marks. He chowed down.

CHAD

They're clear evidence markers...

03/22/2004   27.

REPORTER 1

Any comment, Mr. Clifford?

REPORTER 2

(to Marie)

Did your stepfather rape that girl? How

could he do something like that?

MARIE

Jay...is innocent...

JUDGE WILCOX

Order!

had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District

D.A. MEESE

Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena

Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the

night of the 25th?

CHAD

Yes they do.

D.A. MEESE

Do they show that it was forced?

03/22/2004   28.

CHAD

Yes. There was extensive bruising and

tearing. We found no semen evidence. The

latex abrasions point to the use of

protection. This is quite common in cases

of premeditated rape.

D.A. MEESE

And what can you tell us about Miss

Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?

CHAD

Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common

date rape drug. Traces were also found on

the bottle of beer at the crime scene.

Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's

fingerprints were all over the bottle.

JAY

I took it from her. She was far too young

to be drinking!

D.A. MEESE

Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's

been marked as state's exhibit number 1.

D.A. MEESE

What does this slide show?

CHAD

Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous

bite marks on her upper torso that

occurred during the rape.

JUDGE WILCOX

What about those other markings?

CHAD

I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail

markings, possibly...

JUDGE WILCOX

(to Meese)

Please continue.

03/22/2004   29.

D.A. MEESE

I'm going to show you another slide

that's been marked as state's exhibit

number 2.

D.A. MEESE

What can you tell us about these

mouldings?

CHAD

They were made from the defendant's

teeth, and the tests I conducted show

there's simply no other conclusion. The

bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were

made by the defendant, Mr. Jay

Clifford...

JUDGE WILCOX

Court's adjourned...

REPORTER (ON TV)

...in the face of damning evidence, Jay

Clifford remained defiant. It's thought

that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford

will testify in his defense tomorrow. And

in other news, officials from the FBI

gave a press conference today, commenting

on their involvement in the Black widow

case...

AGENT DAMMERS (ON TV)

After numerous mistakes on behalf of the

local authorities in Blue Bay, the FBI is

mobilizing its task force...

K

03/22/2004   30.

KRISTEN (O.S.)

It's a long shot.

MORRISON

Not a fan of 'Hey, how you doing', are

you?

KRISTEN

Used to play at being a spider when I was

a kid, creeping around silently. Guess I

haven't grown out of it.

M

ORRISON

It's the only thing standing between my

friend and a ten year stretch...

KRISTEN

The forensics lab will have time to look

at it now...the Feds have taken over the

Black widow case...

MORRISON

Goddamn gloryhounds. They knew I was

close. They just want to come in and take

all the credit.

RISTEN

You got a chance, Detective. To help your

friend. Don't let this case slip away as

well...

03/22/2004   31.

MORRISON

Chad, I got a rush job for you.

CHAD

No can do, boss. We're sifting through

the Black Widow evidence...

MORRISON

Feds are movin' in. They'll be taking

over by the case by the end of the week.

MORRISON

You find anything on that tape, you let

me know, OK?

CHAD

Whatever you say, boss.

MORRISON

And make sure you get that money back

into the evidence locker.

ELENA

Nice take off. Gotta work on the

landing...

MARIE

What the hell are you doing here?

ELENA

Looks like your bling ain't blinging...

MARIE

Give me that back. It was my Mother's...

ELENA

Looks like she got ripped off Princess,

where's the rock?

Is that what this is all about?

JENNY

(to her team mates)

We got trouble...

MARIE

You're ruining my life, and my

stepfather's.

ELENA

It can end. Just like that.

03/22/2004   33.

MARIE

Why are you doing this?

ELENA

Because I can.

ELENA (CONT'D)

Good luck in court.

THEO

And why did you go to your stepfather's

building site that night, Miss Clifford?

MARIE

It was my birthday. Jay left the party

before giving me my present.

THEO

And you say you saw Miss Sandoval

leaving?

MARIE

I did.

THEO

And how would you describe her

appearance?

MARIE

She was...she looked fine. She smiled at

me. Actually smiled...

THEO

No further questions.

03/22/2004   34.

D.A. MEESE

Would it be fair to say you don't like

Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford?

M

MARIE

We don't see...eye to eye...

D.A. MEESE

Is that why you attacked her at your

party earlier that night?

MARIE

No...I was...she wasn't invited...

D.A. MEESE

You'd had a few drinks, correct?

MARIE

(reluctantly)

I'd had a drink. Yes.

D.A. MEESE

So by the time you allege to have seen

Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court

exactly how much you'd had to drink?

MARIE

A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...

D.A. MEESE

No further questions.

CHAD

(to himself)

Take out the chroma, raise the

luminescence...

oly shit...

KRISTEN (CONT'D)

Call Detective Morrison. Now...

ELENA (ON TAPE)

You're kidding right?

JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)

C'mon now baby, you can do it...

ELENA (ON TAPE)

Please...you can't do this...

JAY (O.S ON TAPE)

No such word as can't...

JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)

Fuck me...

LENA (ON TAPE)

Please, Mr. Clifford, don't...

JAY (O.S ON TAPE)

Just try to keep those legs together...

03/22/2004   36.

D.A. MEESE

If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to

rape, the state is prepared to drop the

charges of kidnapping and assault.

JUDGE WILCOX

(to Jay)

If I were you I would seriously consider

the offer.

JAY

I'm gonna lose this trial.

THEO

I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a

fake, right? So all we need to do is...

JAY

You had your chance.

(to Marie)

If we're gonna win at all costs, we're

gonna have to change the game.

(to Theo)

Do you have it?

THEO

I'm still dead set against this, Jay.

JAY

I couldn't care less.

MARIE

What's the key for?

JAY

The diamonds...If that's what it takes,

then that's what it takes...

03/22/2004   37.

MARIE

But...they're my inheritance...

JAY

All my assets are tied up in the condos,

Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make

her testify that she faked the tape,

faked the evidence.

MARIE

But, Jay...they're my diamonds...

JAY

As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have

them back. I swear. I know people, who

can...persuade her to hand them over...

MARIE

I

t's wrong.

JAY

More wrong than what she's doing to us?

We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm

not guilty. You know I could never do

anything like this. So do the right thing

and get me out of this hellhole...

MARIE

I can't...

JAY

(tenderly)

No such word as 'can't.' Please...

CURATOR

I knew the day would come, still doesn't

make it any easier...

03/22/2004   38.

CURATOR

The offer still stands, Marie. If you

ever decide to sell them, please give us

a first chance...

MARIE

I don't think I'll be able to, I'm

sorry...

CURATOR

(sotto)

Me too...

LENA

Well, well, well. Look what the cat

dragged in...

(to Theo)

DA know you're here?

MARIE

We need to talk.

ELENA

So talk.

THEO

Somewhere private, maybe?

03/22/2004   39.

THEO

Who's this?

ELENA

Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken

pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out

til morning.

MARIE

Let's just get this over with.

(to Elena)

You won. You got what you wanted...

ELENA

(mocking)

I just wanted justice...

THEO

Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the

jury you faked the evidence, faked the

tape...

ELENA

(sarcastic)

Really?

MARIE

We are prepared to make it worth your

while.

ELENA

(poker face)

Not bad. But I always wanted a family...

03/22/2004   40.

THEO

They're yours after you exonerate my

client.

ELENA

I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up

front.

MARIE

No, that's not the deal.

ELENA

It is now. Take it or leave it.

inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds.

THEO

When this is all over, you'll leave town.

For good.

ELENA

I go more than five miles from the police

station and I'm straight back in juvie...

THEO

I understand your Parole term is up next

week.

ELENA

You've done your homework. Fine.

(points to the ankle bracelet)

As soon as this thing comes off, I'm

outta here...

THEO

May I suggest a little discretion, Miss

Sandoval. Certain...questions might be

asked about this...arrangement if you

were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High

wearing a tiara...

03/22/2004   41.

ELENA

I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too

much class for that shit.

MARIE

You're going to tell the truth on the

stand tomorrow, yes?

ELENA

I swear to tell the truth, the whole

truth and nothing but the truth...

THEO

It's your assertion that my client, Mr.

Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you

on the night of the 25th. Is that true?

THEO

Is that what you say happened?

ELENA

He... He didn't...

ELENA

....just sexually assault me.

03/22/2004   42.

THEO

What...did you just say?

ELENA

He didn't just sexually assault me. He

threatened to kill me if I told anyone...

he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's

THEO

Isn't it true that you were inebriated

during the assault, that it may not in

fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?

D.A. MEESE

Objection. Leading the witness.

JUDGE WILCOX

Sustained. Council will please rephrase

the question.

ELENA

I was messed up, alright. In fact, only

two things I remember. One was that

bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that

Goddamn video camera while he violated

me. The other was what he whispered in my

ear, right before I blacked out...

ELENA

He said, "You won't remember, but you'll

never forget."

KRISTEN

What did she just say?

Lying bitch!

ACTION NEWS ANCHOR

The young victim's wrenching testimonial

proved to be the final nail in the coffin

for Jay Clifford. It took less than an

hour for the jury to deliberate and

sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years.

V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs...

JAY (ON TV)

You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU

CAN'T!

MARIE

No such thing as can't...

Who's there?

KRISTEN

Elena. Open up.

I was sure you'd blow it on the stand,

going on about forgetting and

remembering.

ELENA

Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in

the details.

Richards?

You remember what Elena said, right at

the end of the trial. "You won't

remember..."

it?

Elena's fucking with us.

Any time. Any place...

'breaking and entering'...

I know all about it. Especially having

something stolen...

THEO

(into phone)

Mr. Clifford, this is Kristen Richards,

Elena Sandoval's probation officer.

JAY

She want to pin me for some more crimes?

KRISTEN

No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few

questions. I've noticed some

inconsistencies...

JAY

You've noticed some inconsistencies?

JAY

Here's one big fucking glaring

inconsistency for you: I was set up!

KRISTEN

Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why

were you set up? What would Elena

Sandoval have gained from all this?

up.

AY

What the hell. I'm already in jail. How

much worse can it get? I paid her off,

okay? My assets were tied up in the

condos so we used Marie's diamonds.

defensive)

It wasn't like I had a choice. She had me

by the short an' curlies, understand?

03/22/2004   49.

KRISTEN

But Elena's testimony was damning. Why

wouldn't she play ball?

JAY

What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?

How the fuck should I know? Manipulative

little skank probably figured she could

bleed me for some more money down the

road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm

gonna get those diamonds back, make her

wish she was never born.

ELENA

Later potato...

E

LENA

(sotto)

Oh shit...

MARIE

What the...If anyone sees us together...

03/22/2004   50.

ELENA

What choice did I have? We got big

problems...

MARIE

Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's

listening. Now what's the 411?

ELENA

I...I think I fucked up...

MARIE

How?

ELENA

I don't know for sure...but I think that

bitch Parole officer's made me...she was

at my trailer last night...

MARIE

No bigee. You disposed of everything,

right? The teeth, the video, all the

research...

ELENA

I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.

Wants to see me back in Juvie...

MARIE

I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I

promise.

ELENA

I just want outta here.

03/22/2004   51.

MARIE

Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator,

have him prepare the funds to buy back

the diamonds...

ELENA

Then we're outta here, right?

MARIE

Just sit back, relax, enjoy the

trip...Don't forget to come again.

heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...

MARIE

Can I help you?

KRISTEN

I was wondering if I could have a moment

of your time. Ask a couple questions.

MARIE

I'm in the middle of practice...

KRISTEN

It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might

even help Jay. Remember your loving

stepfather? You want to help him, don't

you?

MARIE

Of course.

03/22/2004   52.

KRISTEN

Why'd you agree to part with your

diamonds?

MARIE

How...

KRISTEN

Jay told me. But why? They were your

inheritance.

MARIE

Jay needed help. We're a team.

KRISTEN

Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You

must've been pretty unhappy when Jay

didn't give you those diamonds for your

birthday.

MARIE

He said I wasn't ready.

KRISTEN

You're 18. That's heiress payday, no?

Must've crossed your mind that Jay might

never let you have them...

MARIE

No, of course not.

KRISTEN

And then this little scam artist saunters

in and just takes them. With your help,

no less.

KRISTEN

But what I don't get is, why wouldn't

Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name?

After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.

MARIE

How should I know?

03/22/2004   53.

KRISTEN

I mean, the only way I can make sense of

it is if somehow getting Jay released

from prison would spoil the plan.

MARIE

What plan?

KRISTEN

You tell me...

CHAD

Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something

I can do for you?

KRISTEN

I was wondering if you'd do me the favor

of running a quick test.

CHAD

Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?

KRISTEN

Could you tell me what this is?

CHAD

No problemo. It'll only take a minute.

CHAD

Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.

03/22/2004   54.

KRISTEN

Are these the evidence photos from the

Elena Sandoval rape?

CHAD

They are, but...

KRISTEN

Ever find out what caused these markings?

CHAD

Like I told the Judge, I guess they're

finger nail markings...

KRISTEN

They don't look like finger nail markings

to me. They look more like this...

KRISTEN

Would you say these markings are the

same?

CHAD

W-where did you get that?

KRISTEN

Marie gave it to me. But you already knew

that, didn't you, Doc?

CHAD

(calling after)

The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.

KRISTEN

Been there. Done that.

03/22/2004   55.

MARIE

Hello?

MARIE

What the hell, Chad?

CHAD

That parole officer was sniffin' around

today.

MARIE

Not you too. She's just trying to prove

her worthless excuse for an existence.

She doesn't have a thing on us.

CHAD

Yeah, but she's askin' the right

questions. It's only a matter of time. We

gotta make our move.

MARIE

No. We stick to the plan. Give the

Curator time to come up with the money...

CHAD

We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...

MARIE

You can't take the heat, get outta the

kitchen.

CHAD

I wanna see 'em. The diamonds.   Make

sure they're safe.

56.

MARIE

They're safe.

CHAD

I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were

supposed to be partners here.

MARIE

You're gonna be the death of me...

CHAD

Open it. I wanna see those puppies.

CHAD

I called the museum. The deal's goin'

down tomorrow. 8 am...

No, I mean he really fucked us. He

drugged me an' took the diamonds!

Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the

diamonds!

MARIE (V.O.)

Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as

it is.

We've gotta stop him.

FUCKING HELL!

We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We

I

'm not gonna hurt him. No way...

I'm gonna kill him.

Marie! Don't do this...

ELENA

Marie!

03/22/2004   60.

MORRISON

You look like you could use a drink.

KRISTEN

When this is all over, I'd like that.

DAMMERS

More Black Widow leads. I need you to put

them in the evidence locker, Morrison.

MORRISON

That's not my job, Agent Dammers.

DAMMERS

It is now.

ELENA

You okay?

MARIE

No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...

03/22/2004   61.

MARIE

He bolted...

MARIE

With the diamonds.

MORRISON

I appreciate the help...

KRISTEN

Right back at ya.

KRISTEN

You could have a helluva holiday on that

money.

score. If I'd gotten to the scene just

five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her

as well...

KRISTEN

What the hell...

KRISTEN

Elena...

03/22/2004   62.

MARIE

Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you

little weasel!

MARIE

Gotcha...

ELENA

This can't be happening...

MARIE

What now?

ELENA

I'm more than five miles away from the

Police station. I go beyond five miles

and the alarm goes off...

MARIE

You telling me your Parole Officer knows

you're out here?

ELENA

She knows...

03/22/2004   63.

ELENA

Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or

she'll find us here...

MARIE

You hear that?

MARIE

You go that way...

ELENA

Please...

MARIE

You see him?

03/22/2004   64.

MARIE

Elena?

MARIE

Useless bitch...

CHAD

Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense

you in the water, they'll rip you to

pieces...

ELENA

Hel..help me...

e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing

CHAD

No.

MARIE

What are you doing? Our diamonds are

about to become dinner...

KRISTEN

Which way, which way...

M

MARIE

Get rid of the body. And his car...

ELENA

Where are you going?

MARIE

Where do you think?

66.

ELENA

I don't...I don't have a clue...

MARIE

Chad made us an appointment to sell

these. I'm gonna keep it...

ELENA

It's only a matter of time before my

Parole Officer finds me...

MARIE

Then I suggest you get to work...

ELENA

Jesus...

CURATOR

Marie? Are you alright?

03/22/2004   67.

MARIE

Never better. Got the money?

CURATOR

I convinced the board of the

extraordinary circumstances

surrounding...

MARIE

Good.

he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...

CURATOR

I...I received a call from your

'associate'. He said he would be handling

the transaction.

MARIE

Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied

up at work. Completely swamped...

MARIE

Calm down. It's just blood.

ELENA

Don't do this to me, please...

03/22/2004   68.

ELENA

You gotta have a lighter or some...

ELENA

Jesus...

ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks

ELENA

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

MARIE

So?

CURATOR

I...I'm not sure...

MARIE

Can you get the cash or not?

CURATOR

I can get the cash...it's just...

03/22/2004   69.

MARIE

Then let's have those dead presidents...

MARIE

What the hell are you doing?

03/22/2004   70.

CURATOR

One last test...

MARIE

NO!

KRISTEN

You okay?

KRISTEN

Care to explain?

ELENA

It was...it was an accident...

CURATOR

Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't

believe they were our top attraction all

these years...

MARIE

That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn

Christmas ornaments...

03/22/2004   71.

CURATOR

Marie, please...

CURATOR

Marie, stop this instant!

MARIE

I hate you, Mom!    I'm glad you're dead!

KRISTEN

I told you.

ELENA

Told me what?

KRISTEN

That if you were telling the truth I'd

back you all the way. If you lied to me

there'd be trouble...

ELENA

Chad swerved off the road, I swear...

KRISTEN

Just swerved for no reason. Just decided

to take a shortcut through the swamp?

ELENA

It was an accident...

03/22/2004   72.

MORRISON

Accident my ass.

MORRISON

Forensics finds the head trauma that

killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a

single blow from behind.

lena looks up, through Panda eyes...

ELENA

The crash. He...he hit his head...

MORRISON

Was that before or after you dragged him

through the swamp?

MORRISON

You got the right to remain silent, which

in your case is probably best, cos of the

shit you come up with...

KRISTEN

That's two strikes, Elena. One more and

you're out.

ELENA

I'll do whatever you want.

KRISTEN

Yeah. Yeah you will.

ELENA

I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you

what happened. She killed him, and took

the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie

Clifford...

03/22/2004   73.

MORRISON

Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the

Judge. I think its time he heard the

truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.

KRISTEN

Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be

cleared, you know that. You need Marie,

you need the proof they set him up...

KRISTEN

You came so close to nailing the Black

Widow, don't let this slip through your

fingers, Detective...

KRISTEN

Speak of the Devil...

KRISTEN

You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna

say that everything went fine. No one

found Chad's body. The plan's still on.

Do you understand me?

MORRISON

You thinking what I'm thinking?

risten's patient with him.

KRISTEN

This is your chance. Feds can't take this

one from you...

ELENA

Yello...

03/22/2004   74.

MARIE (ON PHONE)

The diamonds are fakes. Totally

worthless.

ELENA (V.O.)

No. That can't be true!

MARIE

Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.

ELENA (V.O.)

You can't...what about...me...

MARIE

Don't you understand? There's no money.

Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I

supposed to take care of your broke ass?

KRISTEN

Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her

she can't leave...

ELENA

I...I gotta see you.

MARIE (V.O.)

I'll send you a photo.

ELENA

Please. Just one last time.

MARIE (V.O.)

I'm gone, gone, gonski.

ELENA

I think maybe...maybe there's a way we

could still get some money...

03/22/2004   75.

MARIE

Okay, talk...

ELENA (V.O.)

Not over the phone. We gotta meet.

MARIE

School swimming pool. One hour.

KRISTEN

Where'd you keep the wire taps?

MORRISON

Evidence locker.

KRISTEN

Gimme the key.

ELENA

(whispering)

Can you hear me?

ELENA (V.O.)

Is this thing working?

MORRISON

She's gonna blow it...

03/22/2004   76.

ELENA

I..don't think I can do this...

MARIE (O.S.)

It's already done.

MARIE

So?

ELENA

I had no choice...

MARIE

Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead.

Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it

out.

ELENA

Jay's got cash. At the building site. I

saw it.

MARIE

That's your brilliant plan? It's in a

safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have

you got magic fingers, gonna pick that

lock? I don't think so. Next.

E

LENA (V.O.)

(through the speakers)

We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we

did.

MARIE (V.O.)

Like hell we are.

03/22/2004   77.

ELENA

Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him

we'll come clean, tell the police

everything, if he gives us the

combination. I'm still a minor, they'll

send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do

that time standing on my head...

MARIE

How much money?

ELENA

Enough for you and me.

MARIE

We don't have to tell the cops anything.

We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.

ELENA

But, we got rid of the real one...

MARIE

I kept a copy. Never trusted you

backstabbers.

MARIE

You're trembling.

ELENA

Marie, I...

MARIE

Ssshhhh...

03/22/2004   78.

OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...

MARIE

Alright. Let's do it...

JAY

Well, well, well. Who'd have thought.

What a pleasant surprise. I guess you

guys have kissed and made up?

MARIE

Very funny. Did you know the diamonds

were fakes?

JAY

Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it

all away. You already know the end of her

sorry story...

JAY

So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

MARIE

We want money. Whatever you've got in

your safe at the beach condos.

JAY

Of course you do. Of course you do.

03/22/2004    79.

ELENA

We'll get you out of here...

JAY

You will?

JAY

Is that what I think it is?

MARIE

You give us the combination and this goes

in the nearest mail box, tied with a

pretty pink bow.

JAY

How do I know it's the real tape?

MARIE

You're gonna have to trust us.

JAY

I've been down that road before.

MARIE

This is non-negotiable.

THEO

Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This

could be our only chance.

MARIE

What's the combination?

JAY

I can't...

MARIE

No such word as 'can't'...

RISON GUARD

Time's up, Mr. Clifford.

Fine. 08-20-99.

The combination's the day Mom died, you

sick fuck?

ELENA

Slow down!

ELENA

We're in a world of shit!

ELENA

We'll never get away with this. You know

that don't you?

KRISTEN

Come on, Elena...Keep pushing...

One down...

ELENA (V.O.)

Marie! Please, I can't do this...

MARIE

Two down.

ELENA

I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it

to the police.

03/22/2004   82.

ELENA

I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your

stepfather raping me, made me perjure

myself on the stand, went and killed

Chad, and now...

MARIE

99. A very good year...

MORRISON

This has gotta end.

KRISTEN

It's gonna end. One way or another...

MARIE

Money. Always in style.

Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?

You killed him, Marie. You murdered him

KRISTEN

They want me to bring Elena back to Miami

in the morning.

KRISTEN

I'm... sorry for this whole mess.

MORRISON

Don't be. It was my gun that fired the

shots, so it must've been me who pulled

the trigger. I'll take the credit on this

one. After all the Black widow crap I had

to put up with, I've earnt it...

KRISTEN

You did the right thing...

MORRISON

We did the right thing.

How you holdin' up, Jay?

JAY

Been better.

MORRISON

So what's next?

JAY

No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed.

Guess there's nowhere to go but up.

MORRISON

I can't help but feel partially

responsible. If there's anything I...

JAY

I don't think so, but thanks.

MORRISON

Can I at least give you a ride somewhere?

JAY

Ain't got nowhere to go...

MORRISON

Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't

heard from you. Hope you're doing okay.

Everything's fine here.

we can go for that drink...

You better come with me, Detective.

AGENT DAMMERS

Detective Morrison. So good to finally

see you.

MORRISON

What the hell, Dammers?

AGENT DAMMERS

I should be asking you the same question.

MORRISON

It's...gone.

DAMMERS

That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of

evidence from the Black Widow case.

03/22/2004   89.

DAMMERS(CONT'D)

Not to mention the money you confiscated.

All $427,000.

MORRISON

But how...

DAMMERS

I was hoping you'd be able to answer that

question.

MORRISON

What in God's name are you talking about?

I didn't have anything to do with it!

DAMMERS

Well, your key card was the last one that

opened this locker.

MORRISON

Holy shit. Kristen...

PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

D

ade County Parole. How can I direct your

call?

MORRISON

(into phone)

This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD.

I was wondering if you had a forwarding

number for Kristen Richards...

PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)

Who?

MORRISON

Kristen Richards. She's one of your

officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.

90.

PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here

by that name.

MORRISON

No, of course there is. I worked with her

personally. I...

PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

I have no record of a Kristen Richards

ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's

out of our jurisdiction...

MORRISON

Oh no. No, no, no...

KRISTEN

I can't believe Morrison just handed me

the key to the evidence locker...

he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.

KRISTEN

These are...genuine?

03/22/2004   91.

ELENA

Nothin' like the real thing. Switched

'em for the fakes right after Marie tried

to pay me off...

KRISTEN

They're...So beautiful.

ELENA

The mother.

KRISTEN

The daughter.

MORRISON

She was the Black Widow. Her and that

little...

MORRISON

Played me like a fool.

DAMMERS

Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard

on yourself, Morrison...

(beat, smile)

That's my job.

MORRISON

You smug son of a bitch. It's not like

you knew who she was anymore than I did.

DAMMERS

That's the God's honest truth. But at

least I didn't give her my evidence

locker keycard.

03/22/2004   92.

DAMMERS(CONT'D)

And I didn't lie about who fired the

shots that killed the Clifford kid.

MR. BARAJAS

Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!

MORRISON

What did you say?

CICATRIZ

The foundation is sinking. The entire

site is a sink hole. It's completely

worthless.

MR. BARAJAS

I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...

MORRISON

You and me both...

JAY (O.S.)

Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do

that to a friend. Especially one going

through such a nasty divorce.

JAY

Told me he'd never trust another woman as

long as he lived. And then along came a

spider...

KRISTEN

A black widow.

03/22/2004   93.

JAY

More like widows... Gotta say I was a

little taken aback when you wanted to

snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over

the bitch...

ELENA

You want me to top you off?

JAY

That'd be fine, just fine.

JAY

She's got a good head on her shoulders.

JAY

You two got me out of a mountain of shit,

I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn

scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you

played it perfectly.

KRISTEN

My job was easy. It was Elena who had to

keep it all together...

ELENA (O.S.)

We've had some practice along the way...

ELENA

Here you go, Mr. Clifford.

JAY

Well, all that nasty business, it's

behind us. Forever. From here on out,

it's the good life.

03/22/2004   94.

JAY

You two look so good, it's difficult to

tell which one's the mother and which

one's the daughter...

KRISTEN

That's just the roofies talking...

JAY

What did you say?

KRISTEN

Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party.

I'd never really tasted cocktails like

that.

JAY

I don't...whattya talking about?

KRISTEN

It was like being awake though an

operation. I could feel everything

happening, but I couldn't do anything to

stop it...

JAY

Oh...shit...

KRISTEN

You took something from me that night.

But you left something behind...

KRISTEN

Your daughter...

JAY

I don't remember...

03/22/2004   95.

lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.

KRISTEN

You may not remember...

ELENA

...But you'll never forget.

ELENA

Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.

KRISTEN

Let's go get our money.

KRISTEN (V.O.)

We got problems...

ELENA

Almost done here.

KRISTEN (V.O.)

Leave it. Come on!

96.

KRISTEN (V.O.)

He gonna be able to make an ID?

ELENA

Not on your life. I gave him enough

roofies to make an elephant forget.

ELENA

I can't believe we just gave up all that

cash.

KRISTEN

Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got

an angle on our real prey.

ELENA

We goin' to Blue Bay?

KRISTEN

He won't know what hit him.

ELENA

'bout time...

KRISTEN (O.S.)

That's an awful lot of money...

JAY

Who the hell...

03/22/2004   97.

KRISTEN

Not enough though. Gonna need those

Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this

disaster...

JAY

What? What the hell do you mean?

ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a

KRISTEN

The building's built on a sink hole, Jay.

You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to

think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans

off your back...

JAY

How'd you...how'd you know all this...

KRISTEN

It's what we do.

JAY

We?

MARIE

I just want what's mine...

ELENA

The diamonds are your inheritance. You

deserve them...

MARIE

My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me

the Goddamn key...

03/22/2004   98.

ELENA

So you take it, one way or another...

MARIE

You take a check?

CHAD

Money talks, bullshit walks. I got

strippers to feed...

MARIE

How'd you like to make some real cash?

CHAD

Chad likes the sound of that.

ELENA

Hey, that hurt!

MARIE

Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...

CHAD

We'll put you right here, and...

03/22/2004   99.

JAY (V.O.)

C'mon now baby, you can do it...

ELENA

(to Uncle Marty, irritated)

Will you knock that off? They're gone.

KRISTEN

You're blocking our sun...

UNCLE MARTY

Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best

ever if I might be so bold...

KRISTEN

This is our biggest score. You sure you

can move it?

UNCLE MARTY

Not a problem.

KRISTEN

Let's see the green...

UNCLE MARTY

Got another lead, if you're interested.

Was just up in Boston, surveying a

mansion that's just been sold.

03/22/2004   100.

UNCLE MARTY(CONT'D)

Termites already eaten most of it.

Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be

an angle for the Black Widows...

KRISTEN

It's over. We had a good run.

UNCLE MARTY

Shame. Guess all good things come to an

end. So, the diamonds...

UNCLE MARTY

How do I know these are the real thing?

ELENA

You're going to have to trust us...
