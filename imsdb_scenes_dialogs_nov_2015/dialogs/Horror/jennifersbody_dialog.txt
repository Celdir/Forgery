NEEDY V.O.

Every day, I get letters. I think

I get more letters than Santa

Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil

combined. I'm kind of the shit.

RAYMUNDO

Rec time in five minutes, Needy.

NEEDY

Grassy-ass, Raymundo.

NEEDY V.O.

Sometimes the letters are from

people who say they're praying for

me. They tell me everything will

be okay if I just accept Jesus

Christ into my heart. I say the

words, but nothing ever happens.

Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off

the cross.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Occasionally I get presents from

starfuckers who saw my picture in

the paper and want to marry me or

something. They think they can

take me away from all this.

2.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Like I'd really date some

perverted Chester with a hard-on

for jailbait. I might be insane,

but I'm not desperate.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

A lot of people ask me if I'm

sorry I did it.

NEEDY

(ALOUD)

I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.

NEEDY V.O.

Welcome to the Mental Olympics.

They're big on recreation here.

Supposedly it helps us vent our

aggressions. We've traded in our

hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O

bombs for double dutch.

3.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Even the cutters get in on the

action when they're fully

conscious.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Me? I'm just trying to stay

invisible.

NEEDY V.O.

Personally, I think they're trying

to wear us out. Keep us sluggish

so there won't be an uprising.

Well, those J.V. tactics won't

work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-

C-K-E-R. It even says so on my

chart.

NUTRITIONIST

Just one Toastem, huh?

NEEDY

(QUIETLY)

I like Toastems.

NUTRITIONIST

That's good. But I'm not sure a

Toastem can provide you with

sufficient energy for your day.

I'd recommend more complex

carbohydrates...

(CONTINUED)

4.

NEEDY

I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE

FUCK UP!

NEEDY V.O.

I wasn't always this cracked. I

used to be normal-- well, as

normal as any girl under the

influence of teenage hormones. But

after the killings began, I

started to feel, I don't know...

loose around the edges or

something. I was coming undone

like those jeans I made in Home

Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy

Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.

Dead inside.

CHEESY SONG LYRICS

"Through the trees, I will find

you. Heal the ruins left inside

you. And the stars will remind

you, we'll meet again..."

NEEDY V.O.

God, I hate this fucking song.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEEDY

This is where it all went down.

"Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I

know, but the place just is named

after a dumb waterfall.

NEEDY V.O.

Well technically, it's two

waterfalls. One of them is normal--

it empties into a river basin. But

the other one goes into a hole.

And it doesn't come out. The

scientist guys can't explain it.

They've dropped all kinds of

things down there--bouncy balls,

red dye, radioactive slime-- but

nothing ever surfaces.

6.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Maybe it's another dimension. Or,

you know, just really deep.

NEEDY V.O.

I've probably spent years of my

life in this house. Hundreds of

sleepovers, thousands of aimless

homework sessions, a million phone

calls. I've climbed through

Jennifer's window so many times.

But tonight, only one of us is

going to come out.

NEEDY V.O.

Jennifer didn't always look this

rough. Actually, she was the

prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle

when she wasn't so...hungry.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

She hadn't fed in weeks.

(CONTINUED)

7.

JENNIFER

Huh?

NEEDY

You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh?

You killed Chip! You goddamned

monster! You...ZOMBITCH!

JENNIFER

(GAGGING)

Do you buy all your murder weapons

at Home Depot? God, you're butch.

NEEDY

Know what this is for? Cutting

boxes.

(CONTINUED)

8.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

(HYSTERICAL)

CROSS OUT JENNIFER!

JENNIFER

(CHOKING)

My tit!

MRS. CHECK

Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my

God! Oh my God!

MRS. CHECK (CONT'D)

(SHOCKED)

Needy?

NEEDY

Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get

her?

(CONTINUED)

9.

ROMAN

Christ, Needy, what have you done?

NEEDY

Hi, Roman! How's the Force

treating you? I like that jaunty

cap. Blue like your balls.

ROMAN

How could you do this, Needy?

(EMOTIONAL)

You killed Jen-- Jennifer-- I

mean, the victim. Are you on

something?

NEEDY

Everything's going to be okay now.

I rule.

FEMALE COP

Shut your mouth back there!

NEEDY

Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit

me in like 1998? When my mom

worked the overnight at Hormel?

(CONTINUED)

10.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Yeah. Gracie, right? Gracie. I

really like your hair, Gracie. How

many cans of Salon Selectives did

it take to erect that monument?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Watch it, Puffy Combs. That's

police brutality!

FEMALE COP

You're one to talk about

brutality, Ms. Lesnicki. You're

looking at attempted murder.

NEEDY

Ugh, don't say attempted. That

sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny-

weeny, just like Officer Duda up

there. And trust me-- I'd know.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Let's get our facts straight: I

successfully committed a hard

core, fully premeditated murder

back there. I fucking destroyed

that brat, OK? I, Needy Lesnicki,

put a stop-payment on Jennifer

Check.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Why am I even in these cuffs? I

just saved every guy in this town

from becoming Satan Chow. I'm a

hero.

FEMALE COP

She's delirious.

ROMAN

(MUTTERING)

This is going to be a circus.

(CONTINUED)

11.

FEMALE COP

At least we've already got a

confession.

NEEDY

Confessions are for pussies.

You've got a declaration, Grace.

ROMAN

God, I love this song.

FEMALE COP

I know. And they've done so much

for this town.

ROMAN

They're way more than a band,

really. They're heroes.

FEMALE COP

Wait, this is my favorite part...

FEMALE COP AND ROMAN

(in unison)

"Through the trees, I will find

you. Heal the ruins left inside

you. And the stars will remind

you, that you are home..."

NEEDY V.O.

So I killed her. Whatever. It

won't undo anything. Three pulses--

three lives-- all stopped cold by

adolescent bloodlust. It's hard to

believe that just two months ago,

me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip

were completely normal people.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

12.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

We were our yearbook pictures.

Nothing more, nothing less.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Jesus, Chip..

NEEDY V.O.

Chip couldn't drum for shit. He

only knew "Land of a Thousand

Dances" and the solo from

"Wipeout." Lucky for him, the pep

band gig wasn't too demanding.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

If you can believe it, that's

Jennifer. Yeah, the same girl I

iced with the box-cutter. Only

back then, we were tight. Sisters,

practically. People found it hard

to believe that a babe like

Jennifer would associate with a

dork like me. But we'd been the

Wonder Twins since we were

practically preverbal. Sandbox

love never dies.

(CONTINUED)

13.

CHASTITY

You're totally lesbigay.

NEEDY

What? She's my best friend.

CHASTITY

You stare at her like you want to

dry hump her.

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

Like, hump her through pants.

NEEDY

(INTERRUPTING)

Are you jealous?

CHASTITY

Of what? That rich bitch?

NEEDY

She's not rich.

JENNIFER

Hey, Monistat.

NEEDY

What's up, Vagisil?

JENNIFER

You and me are going out tonight.

NEEDY

Tonight? Why?

JENNIFER

Soft Shoulder are playing at the

Carousel.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

14.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

And it's all-ages, for once, which

means I won't have to play Hello

Titty with the door guy.

NEEDY

What's Soft Shoulder?

JENNIFER

They're this indie band from the

city. I saw their MySpace and the

singer is extra salty. And there

will be lots of other salty

morsels there for you. Come on

Needy, it's the weekend!

NEEDY

It's Thursday.

JENNIFER

Thursday counts as the weekend in

college. And we're going to be in

college twenty-three months from

now. University of Northern

Minnesota Duluth- woo!

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Please, please you're a social

disease?

NEEDY

I have to study.

JENNIFER

(SHOUTING)

Boo! Cross out Needy!

NEEDY

Fine. What time is the show?

JENNIFER

I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom

has a date with that guy who owns

the ham store.

NEEDY

He seems nice.

(CONTINUED)

15.

JENNIFER

(SMIRKING)

Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge...

heart. So huge he gave her a

recurring bladder infection. Wear

something cool, okay?

NEEDY

Okay.

NEEDY V.O.

"Wear something cool" meant

something very specific in

Jennifer-speak. It meant I

couldn't look like a nerd, but I

couldn't upstage her either. I

could expose my stomach, but never

cleavage. Tits were her trademark.

CHIP

Those jeans are hella low. I can

almost see your front butt.

NEEDY

Chip, it's a rock show. This is my

rock look.

CHIP

I can see, like, your womb.

CHIP (CONT'D)

Why are you blowing me off for

some dumb concert, anyway? We were

supposed to have Movie Night. I

even rented Orca. It's like Jaws,

except with a harmless whale.

(CONTINUED)

16.

NEEDY

Jennifer needs me. She really

wants to go see this band. It's

extremely important to her.

CHIP

I've never even heard of Soft

Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer

stalking?

NEEDY

The lead singer, of course. Girls

like her don't go out with

drummers.

CHIP

Thanks a lot!

NEEDY

No offense. I mean, she'd probably

make an exception for a drummer

who was also the lead singer.

CHIP

Like Phil Collins.

NEEDY

Who's Phil Collins?

CHIP

Forget it. He's seminal, but

whatever...

NEEDY

Anyway, this singer guy is like

22, so he could get locked up in

the state pen if he actually dated

her. But Jennifer says he's extra

salty, so...

CHIP

Salty. You guys ever going to stop

using that secret language?

NEEDY

"Salty" means beautiful.

CHIP

Then you must be soy sauce, babe.

(CONTINUED)

17.

NEEDY

Jennifer's here.

CHIP

How do you know?

JENNIFER

(O.S.)

Needy, quit tampooning yourself

and get down here!

CHIP

That's fucking weird.

NEEDY

(straightening her

CLOTHES)

I'd better hurry.

CHIP

You always do what Jennifer tells

you to do.

NEEDY

She's my best friend, Chip.

Remember? This necklace is no

joke.

JENNIFER

(GLOATING)

Guess who's got the whip `til

11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and

it's all mine.

NEEDY

Wow.

(CONTINUED)

18.

JENNIFER

You're lucky you get to ride with

me to the club in style!

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Oh, hi Chip. Do you like puppies?

CHIP

I think you forgot, like, two

buttons.

NEEDY

I think she remembered two

buttons.

JENNIFER

It smells like Thai food in here.

(BEAT)

Have you guys been fucking?

NEEDY

You're gross!

JENNIFER

Okay, let's go to the club.

CHIP

The Carousel is not a club.

JENNIFER

Eat my ass, Chip. You're just

jello `cause you're not invited.

CHIP

I'm not jello! That place is

gross. Everyone there has a

mustache.

(CONTINUED)

19.

JENNIFER

You're totally jello! You're lime

green jello and you can't even

admit it.

CHIP

(calling after them)

Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!

NEEDY V.O.

Chip was right. The Carousel is

definitely not a club. Clubs are

for attractive people in populous

urban areas. Clubs have DJs and

champagne and separate bathrooms

for guys and girls. All we have is

a broken jukebox, a few domestic

taps and the Sticker Toilet.

SMASH CUT TO:

JENNIFER

God, I can't wait until I'm old

enough to get wasted. Have you

ever had peach schnapps?

NEEDY

I don't think so.

(CONTINUED)

20.

JENNIFER

Peach schnapps are excellent. They

even taste good when they come out

of your nose mid-puke.

CRAIG

Hi Jennifer. You look nice.

JENNIFER

(without enthusiasm)

What up, Craig.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

He thinks he's cute enough for me.

No wonder he's in retard math.

NEEDY

Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The

foreign exchange guy. He's all by

himself.

JENNIFER

I can't believe we traded a cute

hockey player for that.

NEEDY

He seems okay. He's got that cool

elephant statue in his locker.

JENNIFER

Do you think he's circumcised? I

always wanted to try sea cucumber.

NEEDY

Ew!

ROMAN

You're smoking dicks now, Jen?

JENNIFER

What? I like the Wides.

(CONTINUED)

21.

ROMAN

I just bet you do. I should arrest

you for possession under the legal

age.

JENNIFER

Arrest me, pfft! You're not even

out of the academy yet, Roman!

ROMAN

Two more months and I'm on the

force for real. Then I'll be able

to cuff you whenever the hell I

want.

JENNIFER

How will I wait that long?

ROMAN

Not here, babe. I gotta keep my

nose clean.

NEEDY

(POINTING)

Look, there's the band!

JENNIFER

You can tell they're from the

city.

ROMAN

Yeah, `cause they look like a

bunch of faygos.

JENNIFER

You would think that. You're such

a small-time Gomer. I wish we had

more guys like that in Devil's

Kettle. All stylish and shit.

(CONTINUED)

22.

NEEDY

They look so-- so cool.

JENNIFER

Hey, I think they need two

groupies. Come on! It'll be like

Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane

and you can be the other girl.

NEEDY

No!

JENNIFER

Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just

boys. Morsels. We have all the

power, don't you know that?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

These things are like smart bombs.

Point `em in the right direction

and shit gets real.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Hi. Um, we just really wanted to

meet you or something? I'm

Jennifer Check and this is my

friend.

NIKOLAI

I'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my

band.

(CONTINUED)

23.

JENNIFER

(AWKWARD)

Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've

heard you guys are super, super

good at playing your instruments.

NIKOLAI

I hope we can live up to

such...high praise.

NEEDY

Hey, if you don't mind me asking,

why did you want to play all the

way out here in Devil's Kettle?

You live in the city, right?

NIKOLAI

Yeah. But I think it's so

important to connect with our fans

in rural areas. Plus, the

audiences in small towns really

appreciate us.

JENNIFER

Can I show you my appreciation

right now?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Like, I'll buy you a drink? I

mean, I'll see if I can get you a

drink. They make this great 9/11

tribute shooter? It's red, white

and blue, but you have to drink it

fast or it gets all brownish.

NIKOLAI

(GRIMACING)

Mmm.

(CONTINUED)

24.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Dirk, what about her?

DIRK

(gesturing to Needy)

Who, Training Bra Jones?

NIKOLAI

No, the hot one. The one who just

walked away. She's it, man. She's

exactly what we're looking for.

DIRK

You're sure she's...

NIKOLAI

She's a kid. We're in God's

country, man. Everyone out here's

a fundie bible-banger. Of course

she's a virgin.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out

to this corn palace for nothing!

DIRK

Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm

not "just the bassist." I'm a

person who happens to play the

bass guitar. And I would like some

respect...

JENNIFER

What? Are you scared of rock stars

too?

NEEDY

Those guys are rank, Jen. Just

forget about it.

(CONTINUED)

25.

JENNIFER

I think the singer wants me.

NEEDY

Only because he thinks you're a

virgin. I heard them talking.

JENNIFER

Yeah, right! I'm not even a

backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to

Roman. By the way, that hurts. I

couldn't even go to flags the next

day. I had to stay home and sit on

a bag of frozen peas.

NEEDY

Oh my God.

JENNIFER

Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I

can do innocent. I'll be Little

Miss Fucking Sunshine.

NEEDY

He's way too old for you.

JENNIFER

Don't cock-block me, Needy.

NIKOLAI

Good evening, Devil's Lake.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft

Shoulder. And we just want to make

you happy.

(CONTINUED)

26.

NEEDY

(to Jennifer)

I know where to go!

JENNIFER

(DAZED)

It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on

fire. Oh God, I'm burning!

NEEDY

You're okay, I promise. You got

burned worse when you wore that

tin-foil bikini to the beach.

Everything's fine.

NIKOLAI

Are you girls all right?

(CONTINUED)

27.

NEEDY

We're great. Maybe you should try

to find your band?

NIKOLAI

Those guys? They were the first

ones out the door. Ran for the van

like a bunch of Marys. Frankly,

I'm ashamed of them.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

God, it feels like hell out here.

Come and hang with us in the van

for a while, just until they hose

this place down.

JENNIFER

Okay...okay...

NIKOLAI

You're in shock. Here, drink this.

You'll feel better.

NEEDY

Aren't you a little freaked out

about this? What about all your

stuff? It's probably melting, and

when you get to the next stop

you'll have to do like, a crappy

acoustic set! Nobody likes that.

NIKOLAI

We'll be able to afford new gear

soon enough. I have a feeling

we're gonna blow up.

(CONTINUED)

28.

JENNIFER

(SLURRING)

I want to see your van. C'mon

Needy, let's go to the van.

NEEDY

Why? Why should we? We have the

Malibu. Let's just get out of

here. We can go to El Ojo and get

Northwoods Nachos with extra

Badger Sauce! Please? I'm

starving.

JENNIFER

Needy, stop it. Just stop it!

NEEDY V.O.

I watched her get into that van

and I knew something awful was

going to happen. But for some

reason, I felt drawn toward them.

Toward him. He was pale and

twisted and evil, like this

petrified tree I saw when I was a

kid.

29.

CROSS CUT

PHONE CALL:

CHIP

(SLEEPILY)

Hey, Niedermeyer.

NEEDY

Thank God you're there. I hoped

you were sleeping with your phone.

CHIP

What's wrong?

NEEDY

Jennifer's gone. She ran off with

that rock band. And the Carousel

burned down.

CHIP

Like, burned down? To the ground?

Is everyone okay?

NEEDY

No. I think they're mostly dead.

CHIP

Shit. You're okay, right?

NEEDY

We went out the bathroom window.

Everyone else was trying to use

the door. It was like a stampede.

The people who fainted got run

over and you could hear their

bones breaking.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

30.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

There was all this screaming and

popping, like a million Black Cats

all going off at once. And the

smell...

CHIP

This is real, right? This isn't

just, like, some crazy dream like

last time?

NEEDY

No! Anyway, it took me like an

hour to walk home. But Jennifer's

still with those creeps! They had

one of those white molester vans

with no windows. The back was all

blacked out.

CHIP

Who cares about Jennifer and those

douchebags with douchebag

haircuts? People just burned to

death. In our town!

NEEDY

(FRANTIC)

Oh cheese and fries! Someone's

here. I'm alone, Chip. I'm freaked

out!

CHIP

Where's your mom?

NEEDY

Swing shift. Listen, I'll call you

in a minute. Stay awake.

CHIP

(SLEEPILY)

Holla back.

(CONTINUED)

31.

NEEDY

Um, Jennifer?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

What happened?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

(TREMBLING)

J-Jen?

(CONTINUED)

32.

JENNIFER

(WHISPERING)

Are you scared?

NEEDY

(screaming after her)

Jennifer!

GOSSIPING GIRL

(WHISPERING)

I heard Needy and Jennifer were

there and they had to fight their

way out with a machete.

OTHER GIRL

Look, she's not even moving.

GOSSIPING GIRL

It's called Post Traumatic Stress

Disorder...

JENNIFER

Happy Friday!, D-bag!

NEEDY

You-- you're all right!

(CONTINUED)

33.

JENNIFER

Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

NEEDY

Last night. At my house. You were

hurt. You had two black eyes and

blood everywhere and...

JENNIFER

Needy, you're delusional. I got a

little banged up when you made me

go out that window, but I'm fine.

NEEDY

(DUMBFOUNDED)

We had to go out that window. The

bar was like, engulfed in flames!

JENNIFER

You do have a tendency to

overreact. Remember at Girl Scout

camp when you thought there was an

earthquake and it was really just

two guys with a ghetto blaster?

NEEDY

A lot of people died, Jennifer.

They burned to death, or they

choked, or they just got trampled.

More than half of the people there

didn't make it out. It's like, all

over the news. National news. Kids

are dead. Parents are dead.

JENNIFER

Anyone we know?

NEEDY

We know everyone!

JENNIFER

Sucks to be them, I guess.

NEEDY

I don't get it. What's wrong with

you?

JENNIFER

What's wrong with you? I mean,

besides the obvious surface flaws.

(CONTINUED)

34.

NEEDY

(to herself)

There's no way I dreamed it. No

way.

NEEDY V.O.

Her blood was still under my

nails. See, I'd been up all night

scrubbing the carnage off the

linoleum.

NEEDY

Work, you...twat! Swiff, darn it!

Swiff! Swiff!

NEEDY (CONT'D)

(softly, to herself)

Shoot.

JENNIFER

Don't talk to yourself. It's one

of your more freakish Needy

behaviors and it makes us both

look like total gaylords.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Eww, you need a mani bad. You'd

better find a Chinese chick to

buff your situation!

(CONTINUED)

35.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

(SMIRKING)

Here comes Handi-Snack.

MR. WROBLEWSKI

I'm sure those of you who made it

here today have all heard the

news. It's a dark day for Devil's

Kettle, a day we can never, ever

forget.

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

The administration here has

decided that today will be a

unstructured day of support and

remembrance. We've lost nine

precious students-- including

Ahmet from India-- several

parents, and a teacher, Ms.

Parrish.

JENNIFER

No way! Parrish ate shit?

MR. WROBLEWSKI

This tragedy is obviously beyond

anything we can measure. More than

ever, we need to band together and

draw strength from each other.

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

(his voice cracking)

We can rise up. We can overcome

death.

(CONTINUED)

36.

JENNIFER

(DRY)

Oh look, they're united in grief.

That'll last.

CHIP

No band practice today.

NEEDY

No anything today.

CHIP

It's surreal, right? I mean, when

just one guy dies in Devil's

Kettle, it's like time stops. And

now so many people are dead,

nobody knows when it's okay to

start again.

NEEDY

I feel guilty just breathing.

CHIP

Word.

NEEDY

Chip, I need to tell you something

kind of weird. It's about

Jennifer.

CHIP

What?

NEEDY

You know last night when we were

talking and someone came to my

door? That was Jennifer. But she

didn't talk. She just stood there,

smiling at me, but a bad kind of

smile. She looked like she'd been

beat up or shot or something. She

was all bloody.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

37.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

And then she barfed up this

disgusting prickly stuff that was

like roadkill and sewing needles

all mixed together.

CHIP

Yuck. Like those porcupine

meatballs my mom makes with the

rice sticking out?

NEEDY

Yeah, like almost that bad!

CHIP

It was probably because she

inhaled a whole bunch of smoke.

NEEDY

No. It was something evil.

CHIP

You might want    to talk to the

school shrink,    Needy. I'm not

saying that to    be a dillhole. I'm

actually kinda    concerned.

NEEDY

Chip, I'm a National Merit

Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and

I'm not crazy.

CHIP

I didn't say you were crazy. It's

just that everyone's a little

messed up about this. It's okay to

feel...

Discombobulated?

CHIP

Yeah, you know. Fucked up.

COLIN

Hi Needy.

(CONTINUED)

NEEDY

Oh. Hi, Colin.

COLIN

(DRAMATIC)

I heard you were there last night.

In the fiery trenches.

NEEDY

Uh-huh.

COLIN

Well, I'm glad you made it out.

Really.

NEEDY

Thanks.

CHIP

How are you friends with Colin

Gray? I thought Colin Gray only

talked to the Dead Girls.

NEEDY

I just am. We have Composition

together. He's a really good

writer. You know-- he's so dark

and emotional and all.

CHIP

Oh. I can relate. I'm also like

that, even if I'm not all obvious

about it like a poseur.

NEEDY

Walk me home?

CHIP

You know it.

(CONTINUED)

39.

JENNIFER

Hi!

JONAS

(ALARMED)

Oh. Hey, Jennifer.

JENNIFER

I'm crazy-sorry about your

profound loss. You are crying

about Craig, right?

JONAS

He was my best friend.

JENNIFER

I know. I was close to him too.

You know, I was there last night

in that horrible place. I saw

Craig a few minutes before the

fire broke out.

JONAS

You-- you did?

JENNIFER

Yeah. I was probably the last

person to talk to him. Like, ever.

Literally.

JONAS

Wow. What did he say?

(CONTINUED)

40.

JENNIFER

Well, we got to talking about you,

actually. And do you know what he

said? He said you were like a

brother to him. Not a bro. An

actual brother.

JONAS

(choking up)

I just can't believe he's gone.

JENNIFER

I know, I know.

(BEAT)

Hey, you know what else Craig

said?

JONAS

What?

JENNIFER

Forget it. It's too intense.

JONAS

What? Please, Jen, you've gotta

tell me!

JENNIFER

Well, he said he always thought

you and me would make a totally

bangin' couple. Isn't that so

weird?

JONAS

He said bangin'?

JENNIFER

(WHISPERING)

Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's

broken.

JONAS

(choking up)

Mine too.

(CONTINUED)

41.

JENNIFER

Come with me. Just for a while.

We'll help each other get through

this nightmare. It's what Craig

would have wanted.

CHIP

The whole night must be a total

blur, right?

NEEDY

That's the thing, it's not a blur

at all! I remember everything, in

like ultra-high-def detail. The

band, the fire, everything.

Especially what happened after.

CHIP

"After" is the part I don't really

get, to be honest.

NEEDY

Please, I need someone to believe

me. Jennifer was-- she was

destroyed. She was dying in my

hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my

CPR training to check her pulse.

And I felt her dying, on the

inside, I mean. I've known her so

long that it's like sometimes I

can feel what she feels. We're

like E.T. and Elliot Ness.

CHIP

I believe you.

NEEDY

Thanks, Chipper.

42.

JONAS

You feel so warm. Why are you so

warm?

JENNIFER

(firmly covering his

MOUTH)

Shutties!

JONAS

(MUFFLED)

Jennifer! Jen...

JENNIFER

What?

JONAS

Look!

JENNIFER

Mm-hmm. They're waiting.

JONAS

Uh, okay...

JENNIFER

Do you miss Craig?

(CONTINUED)

43.

JONAS

(STARTLED)

Of course.

JENNIFER

Don't worry. You're going to see

your buddy again.

JONAS

You mean like in heaven someday?

JENNIFER

No.

You want some, Greedo?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Something's wrong...

RADIO DJ

That was Soft Shoulder, the local

band who became the unlikely

heroes of the tragedy in Devil's

Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses

say the boys helped numerous

people escape the inferno, risking

their own lives in the process.

That's rock n' roll with a

conscience, ladies and gentlemen.

Had a lot of requests for that

one...

MR. WROBLEWSKI

Crap!

TONI

You said it.

NEEDY

Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you

were awake.

TONI

I just had one of my night

terrors.

NEEDY

It's four o' clock, so technically

you had a day terror.

TONI

Right, right. I'm all mixed up

since I started working swing

again.

NEEDY

What did you dream about?

TONI

I dreamed some bad people were

trying to nail me to a tree with

hammers and big stakes and shit.

Just like Jesus.

(CONTINUED)

46.

TONI (CONT'D)

They were trying to get to you

too, but I wouldn't let `em. I'm a

hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear.

NEEDY

(SMILING)

Yes you are.

TONI

It's like, don't y'all touch my

daughter. I'll piss on you like

Calvin.

NEEDY

You know, I can take care of

myself, Mom.

TONI

That's what you think. One of

these days you're gonna be crying

out for me and I might not be

there.

NEEDY

Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to

catch the news after you clocked

out this morning?

TONI

No. I just did my scratch tickets,

snorted a few Lunesta and went

straight to bed. Is something

going on?

NEEDY

Nothing. Forget it.

TONI

Don't nothing happen in Devil's

Kettle.

TONI (CONT'D)

Anita, that ferret stinks. He

needs to be washed from craw to

cornhole.

NEEDY

Yes ma'am.

OFFICER WARZAK

We will get the man that did this

Good for you.

whole body feels like it's on

NEEDY

Yeah.

JENNIFER

It's that good.

NEEDY

Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of

depressed about, you know, the

giant smoldering funeral pyre in

the middle of town?

JENNIFER

Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over.

Life's too short to mope over some

white-trash pig roast.

NEEDY

That's really nice.

JENNIFER

I tell it like it is. Besides, you

should be happy for me. I'm having

the best day since, like Jesus

invented the calendar.

NEEDY

Jesus didn't invent the calendar.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

That's my other line.

JENNIFER

So blow it off.

It'll just be a second.

JENNIFER

Pooh. I'm crossing you out.

I need to see you right now.

I can barely hear you.

CAMILLE

You knock it off!

Can you meet me at McCullum in

ten?

CAMILLE

You knock it off, Chip! You're

NEEDY

Fifteen.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

I have to go.

JENNIFER

What could possibly be more

important than me and my godlike

powers?

NEEDY

I have to meet Chip at McCullum

Park.

JENNIFER

Chip is looking cute to me lately.

So tell me, is he packing some

serious pubic inches? What's the

story down there?

NEEDY

(QUICKLY)

I gotta go.

(CONTINUED)

51.

NEEDY

Why are the cops at your house?

CHIP

They're not. They're at Jonas

Kozelle's house. He got murdered.

NEEDY

What?! Like, he was shot by

gangbangers?

CHIP

(EXASPERATED)

No, Needy! Do you see anyone

rollin' on dubs around here?

(BEAT)

Someone ripped Jonas limb from

limb in the woods behind the

school. Ate parts of him. They

found teethmarks on him-- on the

body.

NEEDY

Some animals must've got to him.

CHIP

Human teethmarks.

NEEDY

Who would do that?

(CONTINUED)

52.

CHIP

I don't know. It just happened

after school. No one's supposed to

know yet, but my dad went over

there and talked to the cops.

Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's

just staring out the front window

like a zombie mannequin robot

statue.

NEEDY

This can't be a coincidence.

CHIP

What do you mean, Needy?

NEEDY

A fiery death trap last night, and

now a cannibal eats our starting

tight-end? Come on!

CHIP

Don't get spooky on me, babe.

NEEDY

Seriously Chip. Most small towns

only have something gruesome

happen like, once every decade

maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two

nightmares in 24 hours? It's

freaktarded. It's not right.

CHIP

What, do you think it's, like

supernatural?

NEEDY

I don't know. I'm extremely

intelligent but I obviously don't

know everything.

CHIP

Well, the bad luck's gotta be over

now, right? It can't get any

worse, right? Obviously it can't.

It can't. I mean, you agree,

right? There won't be another

victim.

NEEDY

You're shaking.

I'm cold. It's very cold out here.

Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEEDY V.O.

We were famous. We were saints.

Our town's only bar had burned to

the ground and our star

quarterback was somebody's Quarter

Pounder. The whole country got a

huge tragedy boner for Devil's

Kettle. And the press-- God, they

couldn't get enough of our little

As you know, this is the one month

anniversary of the Carousel fire

and also the murder of Jonas

Kozelle...

JENNIFER

Bo-ring!

NEEDY

(WHISPERING)

Are you okay?

JENNIFER

No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin

is breaking out. My hair is dull

and lifeless. God, it's like I'm

one of the normal girls!

NEEDY

Are you PMS-ing or something?

JENNIFER

PMS isn't real, Needy. It was

invented by the boy-run media to

make us seem crazy.

NEEDY

Oh.

MR. WROBLEWSKI

...As I was saying, Needy and

Jennifer, I finally have some good

news to share with all of you. The

members of the rock group Soft

Shoulder have decided to extend a

helping hand to our community.

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

As you know, their song "Through

the Trees" has become our

unofficial anthem of unity and

healing. So, they've decided to

release it as a benefit single.

(MORE)

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

3% of the profits will go to local

families who have been affected by

loss.

NEEDY

What about the other 97%?

MR. WROBLEWSKI

Excuse me?

NEEDY

The other 97%. I mean, that's just

crass. Right?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

Crass. It means scummy. Greedy. Am

I the only one who actually does

the vocab drills?

CHASTITY

Soft Shoulder are American heroes.

NEEDY

No, they're not. I was there,

Chastity. They didn't actually

help anyone escape the fire. I

don't even know how that rumor got

started.

CHASTITY

Rumor?! RUMOR? It's true! It's on

their Wikipedia page!

NEEDY

Oh, that's crap...

MR. WROBLEWSKI

GIRLS--

NEEDY

They've milked our pain-- our loss-

- to get a stupid record deal! No

one would even know who they were

if they hadn't been playing here

that night. They used us.

You take that back, Needy

Lesnicki! We need them now more

then ever!

MR. WROBLEWSKI

That's enough.

NEEDY

I'm already sick of that song.

JENNIFER

Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could

the bass be any lower in the mix?

NEEDY

No offense, but you look kind of

drained. Is everything all right?

JENNIFER

I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing

off or something.

NEEDY

What's wearing off?

Are you on pot?

No, dick ridge! Just forget I said

anything.

I don't like boxing movies.

COLIN

It's not...fuck it. Never mind.

JENNIFER

Wait!

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Know how.

NIKOLAI

Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.

DIRK

And to get more, we have to

butcher you. And bleed you.

They...killed you.

few days? We want to commune with

his corpse. He was our spooky

homeboy.

(CONTINUED)

80.

PRIEST

Children, this is a private

service for family only.

GOTH GIRL

(to Colin's mother)

Oh, right. I need to ask you

something, Mrs. Gray. It's really

important for me to have closure.

PRIEST

Young lady, have some respect for

this family...

MRS. GRAY

(waving him off)

No. It's fine.

GOTH GIRL

Is it true that Colin had a date

with Jennifer Check the night he

was killed?

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)

Because Jennifer Check is a social

disease. She's not like us. She

thinks she's so special just

because she's popular and and is

what "society" considers

"attractive." But she's not

sincere. She's about as emo as a

breast implant! And she listens to

Jessica Simpson and shops at

Hollister. And I just know Colin

would never go out with someone

like that, and I just need

confirmation. From you. So did he?

MR. GRAY

Did he...?

GOTH GIRL

Have a date with Jennifer Check.

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)

Oh God. Oh God. I knew it! That

BITCH! I will erase her! I'll put

a freaky Druid spell on her!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

81.

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)

I'll spell her preppy ass right

into the ground!

GOTH BOY

Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad

at the person who murdered Colin.

All Jennifer Check did was invite

him over to watch Aquamarine.

GOTH GIRL

That's WORSE!

GOTH BOY

Colin wouldn't have liked this.

MRS. GRAY

(losing it)

Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah,

you're right! I'm pretty sure my

son wouldn't have liked being

eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and

buried before his eighteenth

birthday! Wow, you must have known

him so well!

MR. GRAY

Jill...

MRS. GRAY

By the time they found Colin in

that godforsaken house, he looked

like lasagna with teeth. I'd know--

I had to identify the remains. My

boy's not in the realm of the

undead. He's not flying around in

the firmament with magical wings

of flame. He's in an overpriced

rosewood box that's headed six

feet downtown.

(CONTINUED)

82.

MRS. GRAY (CONT'D)

So you can take your pain and

shove it up your asses, kids.

I got the monopoly on pain!

NEEDY V.O.

They did a big memorial assembly

for Colin at school, and we had to

watch another presentation about

curfews and the buddy system and

how to deal with grief. But nobody

seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was

last week's emotion.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since

our encounter in my room.

Actually, I hadn't really spoken

to anyone. I was busy with

research. Paranormal research.

CHIP

Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets

yet? I don't get paid until next

week.

(CONTINUED)

83.

NEEDY

I gotta show you something.

CHIP

What is it?

NEEDY

Not here. Behind the school.

CHIP

What is it?

NEEDY

Evidence.

CHIP

(WEARILY)

Is this about Jennifer?

NEEDY

Yes, but I promise you this is the

last thing I need to show y--

CHIP

(INTERRUPTING)

Needy, I care about you. A lot. As

a person, not just a girl I made

love to for four minutes the other

night. And I'm scared of what's

happening to you. You're acting

really fucked up.

NEEDY

Please just let me show you.

NEEDY

Look at this.

(CONTINUED)

84.

CHIP

(CONFUSED)

Demon...demonic...

NEEDY

Demonic transference. It's

something that happens when you

try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan

without using an actual virgin!

NEEDY (CONT'D)

I think that's what happened to

Jennifer. Those guys from that

band were trying to sacrifice her

in the woods. But what they didn't

realize is that she hasn't been a

virgin since junior high!

Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster!

It all makes sense now! Read

this...

NEEDY (CONT'D)

(READING)

"If the human sacrifice is impure,

the result may still be attained,

but a demon will forever reside

the soul of the victim. She must

forever feed on flesh to sustain

the demon." See?

CHIP

Uh-huh.

NEEDY

She's eating boys! They make her

strong. Really strong. And when

she's hungry, she gets weak and

cranky and her hair is all full of

split ends. And look at this...

NEEDY (CONT'D)

It says that before the demon

feeds, it vomits a gruesome

substance on its prey. Like I saw!

(CONTINUED)

85.

CHIP

You--you really think Jennifer

killed Jonas and Colin?

NEEDY

And possibly Ahmet from India.

CHIP

Really? You think she ate those

guys?

NEEDY

No. No! Of course not!

CHIP

Is that what you think?

NEEDY

No...Listen, I'll make an

appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm

real sorry about this sudden onset

of teenage paranoia.

(ROBOTIC)

My hormones and emotions are

aswirl, and my moods are

erratic...

CHIP

It's all right, Needy.

NEEDY

This has been a crummy school

year, Chip.

CHIP

No shit.

NEEDY

Listen, I'm done with all that

devil stuff. Do you know what

you're wearing to Turnabout?

CHIP

I was thinking a suit with black

shoes and a boutonniere, right

here.

(CONTINUED)

86.

NEEDY V.O.

I was so in love with him. I

didn't want to mess it up with my

infectious crazy. Only I wasn't

actually crazy. Everyone else was

crazy. But when you're the only

sane one, you might as well be

crazy. It's subjective, you know?

CHIP

What color dress are you gonna

wear? I need to order your wrist

corsage.

NEEDY

I don't know yet.

CHIP

How about magenta? You're

definitely a winter. My mom says

winters should wear regal jewel

tones like magenta. Or possibly

teal.

NEEDY

Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.

CHIP

Well, they call them "sales reps"

now.

NEEDY

Right. Well, I'll try to find

something magenta.

CHIP

That'll look dope.

(CONTINUED)

87.

TONI

You look beautiful.

NEEDY

I look pork stupid.

TONI

No, you've got that tiny waist,

like a fashion model. I always

thought you looked like Cindy

Crawford.

NEEDY

Who's Cindy Crawford?

TONI

One of the great beauties of our

time. She's even got a mole like

you, except hers is on her face.

NEEDY

Ow! You're too close to my neck.

TONI

Well, if Chip gives you a hickey,

you can just tell everyone I

burned you.

NEEDY

Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that

ostentatious.

TONI

Now that's a word you don't hear

every day. Hold still.

NEEDY

What are you doing to my hair?

TONI

Hooker helmet.

(CONTINUED)

88.

NEEDY

(GROANING)

Aw, jeez Mom!

TONI

If you can't have big what-nots,

you might as well have big hair!

CHIP

I'm in underpants, Mom!

CHIP'S MOM

I need to give you something.

CHIP

Hang on.

CHIP (CONT'D)

Ladies' pepper spray?

CHIP'S MOM

I've been thinking about it for a

while, and I think you need to be

carrying this. There's obviously a

sicko out there who likes boys.

Boys your age. And I don't want

you going out there unarmed.

CHIP

I can take care of myself. I've

been using the Bowflex.

CHIP'S MOM

Did you hear what Colin Gray

looked like when they found him?

(CONTINUED)

89.

CHIP

Lasagna with teeth?

CHIP'S MOM

You heard. So unless you want to

wind up looking like another

exotic Eye-talian dish, take

Mommy's rape spray.

CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)

Are you picking Needy up at her

house?

CHIP

Meeting her at the dance. I'm

gonna walk. It's so warm outside.

It's like 40.

CHIP'S MOM

I want pictures with your sister

before you go.

CHIP

Yes, ma'am.

CHIP'S MOM

One more. Back to back. Big

smiles. Camille, we don't touch

ourselves down there. That's our

lady garden.

GOTH GIRL

(popping balloon)

This is my heart.

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)

(popping balloon)

My soul.

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)

(popping balloon)

Everything I once believed in.

GOTH GIRL #2

(MOCKINGLY)

Your abortion.

GOTH GIRL #2 (CONT'D)

Your other abortion.

GOTH GIRL

I hate your guts, Madison.

91.

MR. WROBLEWSKI

Can I have everyone's attention

please?

(CONTINUED)

92.

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I

hope you've all had an opportunity

to consume the Pecan Sandies and

Cran-Grape that were so generously

donated by the Parents Club.

MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

But the real treat is yet to come.

It's happening right about now,

this treat of which I speak. We

have some very special guests

tonight. They were kind enough to

take a break from their sold-out

national tour and play our dance

for free.

JENNIFER

CHIP!

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Didn't you hear me calling your

name?

CHIP

You weren't calling my name.

JENNIFER

Yes, I was.

CHIP

I couldn't hear it.

JENNIFER

I think you were maybe spacing

out. You were like this: Derrrrr.

CHIP

I was?

(CONTINUED)

93.

JENNIFER

Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I

need to talk to you about you-know-

who. Our little Needy.

CHIP

I know.

JENNIFER

Are you worried? `Cause I'm super-

stressed about her. God knows how

I even sleep at night.

CHIP

She hasn't been the same for

weeks.

JENNIFER

I think I know what's wrong with

her. In fact, I know I know what's

wrong with her.

CHIP

Then tell me.

JENNIFER

I feel bad telling you this.

(SIGHING)

Okay, you know Needy's been a

total Lithium candidate since the

night Colin Gray died. But that's

not just because he was brutally

murdered and stuff. It's

because....I don't wanna say this.

CHIP

Say it!

JENNIFER

Needy and Colin were intimate. By

that I mean he was poking her

donut on a semi-regular basis.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

I know this must be hard for you

to hear.

CHIP

Needy's not like that.

(CONTINUED)

94.

JENNIFER

That's what she wants you to

believe. But trust me, her and

Colin were doing stuff you haven't

even heard of. Total varsity

moves.

CHIP

But you were with Colin the night

he was killed.

JENNIFER

Well, apparently he had a thing

for me-- no surprise there. And I

figured Needy was busy jumping

your jock that night, so I agreed

to a little pity date. Colin

brought me to that empty house so

we could have some privacy. But he

wanted to go too far, so I left

after a few minutes. Next thing I

knew, they'd found...

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

...what was left of him.

CHIP

(to himself)

Eye-talian.

JENNIFER

Huh?

CHIP

Never mind.

JENNIFER

I'm sorry you had to hear this

from me. I'm just so worried about

Needy. She's losing her shit.

Colin was her everything.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

I wouldn't be surprised if she

winds up in the nuthouse.

CHIP

I just can't believe this.

(CONTINUED)

95.

JENNIFER

Well, you've been talking to her

more than I have. How bad is it?

CHIP

It's bad, man. It's bad.

JENNIFER

I can only imagine the paranoid

theories she's come up with.

CHIP

Oh, you have no idea.

JENNIFER

I just can't believe she would do

this to you. I care so much about

you, Chip.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

More than I've ever had the guts

to admit.

MR. WROBLEWSKI

Boys and girls, please

welcome...Soft Shoulder!

NIKOLAI

Good evening, babies. Are you

ready for some bad vibrations?

NEEDY

Chip!

(CONTINUED)

96.

JENNIFER

Needy didn't deserve a boy like

you.

NEEDY V.O.

One thing people don't know about

me is that I'm fast. I just never

went out for track because I look

bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told

me track was for lezzies. But I

am. Fast, I mean. Even in that

fucking afterbirth of a dress, I

could really tear up the asphalt.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

I had to. I was running for his

life.

JENNIFER

Ooh, you're so salty!

CHIP

Yeah, you too.

JENNIFER

Say it like you mean it.

CHIP

You're so salty. I need water. It

burns. The salty burns my mouth.

(CONTINUED)

97.

JENNIFER

Say I'm better than Needy.

CHIP

What? Why?

JENNIFER

We really shouldn't be doing this.

CHIP

(QUICKLY)

You're better than Needy.

JENNIFER

Natch.

CHIP

This feels weird. Can we go

somewhere else?

JENNIFER

I have just the place.

CHIP

Murphy Pool? I don't think we can

go in there. I knew some skater

guys who went in there. They got

in big trouble and now they have

to pick up garbage for 100 hours.

JENNIFER

You're in big trouble anyway. Come

on.

(CONTINUED)

98.

NEEDY

(STRAINED)

Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper

home?

CHIP'S MOM

Needy? Is something wrong?

NEEDY

Where's Chip?

CHIP'S MOM

(CONFUSED)

He left for the dance at least

twenty minutes ago. He certainly

should have been there by now.

NEEDY

He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to

only tell me that in these

dangerous, godless times-- you let

your only son walk alone at night?

CHIP'S MOM

Well, it's only five blocks. My

God, your hair is...

NEEDY

Which way did he go?

CHIP'S MOM

He usually cuts across the park.

CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)

Camille, let's sit like a lady! No

one wants to see your kiki.

CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)

Why don't you try...

(CONTINUED)

99.

CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)

Anita?

CHIP

Aren't you cold?

JENNIFER

Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma.

CHIP

What are you doing?

JENNIFER

Swimming.

CHIP

Ha ha.

JENNIFER

Come on in, Chip. Show me your

breast stroke.

CHIP

The water looks disgusting.

JENNIFER

It's not so bad.

CHIP

Are you kidding? It's totally

bubonic in there. I think I see a

dead possum with a Doritos bag in

its pouch. And that looks like a

used syringe over there...

(CONTINUED)

100.

JENNIFER

I'm sorry. I was just trying to

make you laugh. I think now, more

than ever, we need laughter. We've

both lost a close friend.

CHIP

I know.

JENNIFER

I feel so empty.

CHIP

Me too.

JENNIFER

Please come here and kiss me

again. Make all this madness go

away.

NEEDY

(YELLING)

Chip!

NEEDY (CONT'D)

I'm coming!

Holy crap!

Saint Jude, patron saint of

hopeless causes: Please give me

the power to crush this bitch.

JENNIFER

Fuck this J.V. shit!

CHIP

(CROAKING)

She can fly?

NEEDY

She's just hovering, CHIP. It's

not that impressive.

JENNIFER

God, do you have to undermine

everything I do? You're such a

player-hater.

NEEDY

You're a jerk.

JENNIFER

Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got

any more harsh digs?

NEEDY

You know what? You were never a

good friend. Ever. Even when we

were little. You used to steal my

toys and pour lemonade on my bed

and make me be Ugly Ashley when we

played Barbies!

JENNIFER

And now I'm eating your boyfriend!

See? At least I'm consistent.

NEEDY

Why do you need him? Huh?

NEEDY (CONT'D)

(SOBBING)

Why do you need the one guy who's

ever liked me? You can have

anyone, Jennifer!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

103.

NEEDY (CONT'D)

The cutest guy in school. The

mailman. A teacher. You could

probably even have a huge star

like Chad Michael Murray. So why

Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss

me off? Or is it because you're

insecure?

JENNIFER

I am not insecure. God, what a

joke! How could I be insecure? I

was the Snowflake Queen!

NEEDY

Yeah, two years ago. When you were

socially relevant.

JENNIFER

I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT!

NEEDY

You were skinny then, too!

JENNIFER

I'm gonna eat your soul and shit

it out, Lesnicki.

NEEDY

(TREMBLING)

I thought you only murdered boys.

JENNIFER

I go both ways.

(CONTINUED)

104.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Ow-Ow-Ow.

NEEDY

(SURPRISED)

We hurt you...

JENNIFER

Got a tampon?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Thought I'd ask. You seemed like

you might be pluggin'.

NEEDY

Where are you going?

JENNIFER

Fuck this noise. I'm out. You

losers are more trouble then

you're worth.

NEEDY

(EMOTIONAL)

Why give up now? He's almost dead!

Get your bulimic ass back here and

kill us both!

JENNIFER

Nah. I mean, you say I've been a

bad friend all these years. I

might as well throw you a bone.

(CONTINUED)

105.

NEEDY

Oh, Chip!

CHIP

Needy. You saved me.

NEEDY

I'm gonna call for help.

CHIP

Oh no, I'm out of minutes!

NEEDY

I think 911 is always a free call.

CHIP

Oh yeah. You're right.

NEEDY

It's not working. It's full of

Jennifer-goo.

CHIP

(FAINTLY)

Hey, I'm going somewhere...

NEEDY

No! You're not going anywhere!

CHIP

I'm toast, Needy. I'm definitely

gonna die. I think I already died

before you were here, but I woke

up when I heard your voice.

(CONTINUED)

106.

NEEDY

I love you.

CHIP

Yeah me too. And you look hot in

that dress.

NEEDY

You're clearly delirious.

CHIP

No. When you're dying, you can see

everything a lot clearer. You can

see what's true and what's not.

The things that are true have this

glowing halo of light around them,

like a picture of the Baby Jesus,

or Barbara Walters when they use

the special lens. And I know for

sure that you're totally hot.

CHIP (CONT'D)

You'd better get out of here. The

police are going to come and I

don't want them to, you know, make

a mistake.

NEEDY

I'm never leaving.

CHIP

But I have to go.

NEEDY

No!

Shut up. It's good PR.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

I said, it's so good to be here!

GIRL

What are you looking at, Clumpy?

NEEDY

(QUIETLY)

Just watching your old man try to

suck the ugly off your face.

GUY

What did you say?

GUY (CONT'D)

Are you supposed to be Goth or

something?

(CONTINUED)

108.

NEEDY

Did you know the original Goths

were a Germanic tribe that settled

in Rome? They didn't wear black.

They wore regular linen tunics. I

don't know why nobody else knows

that.

NIKOLAI

(to Dirk)

We gotta get out of here.

DIRK

Why?

NIKOLAI

I think this girl's flipping out.

DIRK

What could she do to us?

NIKOLAI

Look at her.

NEEDY

(into the mic)

You didn't play your hit yet.

NEEDY V.O.

They found Chip the following

morning. The police couldn't find

an explanation for the "substance"

in the pool, so they chose not to

mention it to the press. In fact,

they treated the whole incident

like a bad dream.

NEEDY

Trouble was, some of us would

never wake up.

NEEDY V.O.

I never went back to school after

that. Didn't talk much either. My

mom bought some books so she could

teach me at home like crazy

Christians with 14 kids do. But I

wasn't a very cooperative student.

(CONTINUED)

110.

NEEDY V.O.

What nobody realized was that I

was doing a different kind of

homework. I was watching her every

night. Waiting.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

Waiting for her to get weak and

dull. Waiting for her to burn

through the life-force she'd

stolen from Chip.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

It took weeks, but I finally made

my move. Remember?

NEEDY V.O.

Even in her last moments of life,

she somehow managed to be cooler

than me.

(CONTINUED)

111.

NEEDY

She left an insanely hot corpse.

NEEDY V.O.

I don't even know who Needy

Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a

different person now. A person who

uses curse words and kicks

orderlies and and sees things that

aren't there. A very bad, very

damaged person.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

But sometimes, change can be good.

For instance, most occult scholars

don't know this, but if you're

bitten by a demon--and you live--

you just might absorb some of the

demon's abilities.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)

You just might get lucky for once

in your miserable life.

East, toward Madison.

OLD MAN

East, huh? Guess I'm headed that

way. But I'm gonna need you to pay

me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?

No free rides in this wagon.

NEEDY

I don't have any money or drugs,

so you'll have to settle for ass.

OLD MAN

Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.

OLD MAN (CONT'D)
