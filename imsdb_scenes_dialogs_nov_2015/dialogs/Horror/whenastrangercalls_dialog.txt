SHOOTING DRAFT

8 pm Tuesday, March 23, 1971

WIFE

Where's the girl?

DOCTOR

I only called her ten minutes ago --

WIFE

(passing into living

room)

I made our reservation for 8:15.

We're going to be late.

DOCTOR

Here she is now.

JILL

Dr. Minakis?

DOCTOR

Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets

it wrong the first time. You're Jill?

Come on in.

JILL

(entering)

Thank you.

WIFE

I've written the number of the

restaurant on the notepad by the

phone.

(to Doctor)

Zip me up, will you please?

(to Jill)

If we aren't home in two hours, it

means we've decided to go on to a

movie and won't be back until after

midnight. Is that all right?

JILL

Sure.

DOCTOR

(helping wife on with

her coat)

I've told my service to pick up any

calls coming in to my office phone.

WIFE

The children are asleep upstairs --

first door on your left at the top

of the landing. They're both just

getting over a cold -- so try not to

wake them.

JILL

Okay.

WIFE

Do you have any questions?

WIFE

We have to go now. We're late.

DOCTOR

Make yourself at home. The

refrigerator's loaded.

WIFE

(pulling doctor through

the door)

Goodbye.

DOCTOR

We even have some low-fat yogurt.

WIFE (O.S.)

Will you please come on!

DOCTOR

Bye.

CUT TO:

NANCY (O.S.)

Hello?

JILL

Nancy?

NANCY (O.S.)

Hello, Jill? How's it going?

(out of phone)

I got it, Dad!

(beat)

Father!

(into phone again)

Jesus Christ! My father's in one of

his moods again. Male menopause, you

know. So how are you?

JILL

All right.

NANCY (O.S.)

Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis'?

JILL

Yeah, I've been here for about an

hour already.

NANCY (O.S.)

Isn't it a neat house?

JILL

I guess... I haven't looked around

very much.

NANCY (O.S.)

Did you see his kids?

JILL

No, they were asleep when I got here.

NANCY (O.S.)

They're really cute. So what can I

do for you?

JILL

You didn't happen to talk to Billy

today, did you?

NANCY (O.S.)

Yeah, I talked to him.

JILL

Did he say anything about me?

NANCY (O.S.)

I don't know what you did to him, or

said to him, or what... but he's

really pissed off at you! What did

you do?

JILL

It's what I didn't do.

NANCY (O.S.)

(sarcastic)

Yeah, I can imagine.

JILL

Do me a favor, Nance.

NANCY (O.S.)

What.

JILL

Do you think you'll be talking with

Billy some time tonight?

NANCY (O.S.)

Prabably. I'm going to the library

in a few minutes. I just have to get

out of this house!

(beat)

Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over

there? He'll come along if I tell

him to.

JILL

That isn't what I had in mind.

NANCY (O.S.)

You'll be safe with Billy. I'll be

there. Come on.

JILL

Nancy, all you want to do is come

over here and get drunk.

NANCY (O.S.)

Who? Me?

JILL

(mimicking)

Who? Me?

NANCY (O.S.)

You want to see Billy, don't you?!

JILL

I've got a lot of work to do. I don't

want you coming over!

NANCY (O.S.)

You know what your problem is, Jill,

is you're so straight. I really mean

that. You go to a private school,

you wear a bra. No one can have a

good time with you!

(beat)

You know, Billy asked me to go out

with him this weekend, and I was

really really tempted because I like

Billy... a lot... as much as you do.

But I told him I couldn't, that I

didn't think it was right because

you were my friend --

JILL

You are my friend.

NANCY (O.S.)

Yeah. I guess so.

JILL

Listen, just give Billy the number

here, but don't tell him I told you

to. Okay?

NANCY (O.S.)

Okay. I've got to go now.

JILL

Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.

NANCY (O.S.)

Yeah. Bye.

CUT TO:

JILL

Hello?

JILL

Billy?...

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Have you checked the children?

JILL

What?

CUT TO:

JILL

Hello?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Have you checked the children?

JILL

Mrs. Mandrakis?

JILL

Hello!

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Have you checked the children?

JILL

Billy! I don't think this is very

funny!

JILL

...Who is this?

CUT TO:

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

Golden Bull...

JILL

Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr.

Mandrakis. This is his babysitter.

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

Hold on a minute.

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

Hello?

JILL

Yes?

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant

about forty minutes ago.

JILL

Forty minutes?

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

That's right.

JILL

(after a beat)

Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR (O.S.)

Operator...

JILL

Hello, Operator? Can you get me the

police?

OPERATOR (O.S.)

Is this an emergency?

JILL

Yes!

(beat)

No, not really.

OPERATOR (O.S.)

The number is 555-9431. Would you

like me to connect you?

JILL

Please.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

JILL

Hello, I've been getting phone calls,

every fifteen minutes or so. I think

it's a man. He's trying to scare me.

SACKER (O.S.)

An anonymous caller?

JILL

That's right.

SACKER (O.S.)

Has he threatened you?

JILL

No.

SACKER (O.S.)

Has he been using obscene language?

JILL

No. He just keeps calling me.

Sometimes he doesn't say anything.

SACKER (O.S.)

There's really nothing we can do

about it down here. Is the phone

listed in your name?

JILL

No, I'm just the babysitter.

SACKER (O.S.)

It's probably just some weirdo. The

city's full of them. Believe it or

not, we get reports like this every

night. It's nothing to worry about.

JILL

Oh...

SACKER (O.S.)

Have you tried whistling?

JILL

What?

SACKER (O.S.)

If you can find a good loud whistle

somewhere in the house, blow it into

the phone hard, next time he calls.

Probably break his eardrum. He won't

bother you after that.

JILL

No, I... You're probably right. It's

nothing to worry about.

SACKER (O.S.)

Or you could just take your phone

off the hook.

JILL

No, the people I'm babysitting for

might try to reach me.

SACKER (O.S.)

Well, as I say, there's nothing we

can really do to help you down here.

JILL

Okay. Thank you.

SACKER (O.S.)

You bet. Goodnight.

JILL

Goodnight.

CUT TO:

JILL

Hello?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Why haven't you checked the children?

SACKER (O.S.)

Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.

JILL

I called you before... about the man

who keeps calling me?

SACKER (O.S.)

Oh, yeah.

JILL

He called me again.

SACKER (O.S.)

Did you try whistling?

JILL

No, he's out there somewhere.

SACKER (O.S.)

Out where?

JILL

In the neighborhood. He's been

watching me... through the windows.

SACKER (O.S.)

Did you see him?

JILL

No. I know he's there.

SACKER (O.S.)

Is the house locked up?

JILL

Yes.

SACKER (O.S.)

And the windows?

JILL

Yes. Everything.

SACKER (O.S.)

Then you're safe. If he wanted to

break in, he wouldn't be calling

you.

JILL

Please, can't you help me? I'm all

alone.

SACKER (O.S.)

Tell you what. If this guy calls you

again --

JILL

He will call again! I know he will!

SACKER (O.S.)

Okay, calm down now. I can alert the

phone company so that if he calls

again we can try to trace the call.

What's your number there?

JILL

555-0672.

SACKER (O.S.)

And the address?

JILL

3317 Oakridge Drive.

SACKER (O.S.)

Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All

right. If the guy calls again, try

to keep him on the line for at least

a minute so we can trace the call.

JILL

But he never stays on that long!

Sometimes he hangs up after just a

couple of seconds.

SACKER (O.S.)

It's the only way we can help you.

(beat)

By the way, what's your name?

JILL

Jill Johnson.

SACKER (O.S.)

Jill, the important thing is to relax.

You're safe where you are. We've got

patrolmen cruising the area all night

long. Just stay calm. Will you do

that for me?

JILL

Yes.

SACKER (O.S.)

In the meantime, we'll be watching

your line. Okay, Jill?

JILL

Okay.

SACKER (O.S.)

Call again if there's any problem.

JILL

Thank you.

SACKER (O.S.)

Goodnight.

CUT TO:

JILL

Hello?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

It's me.

JILL

I know. Who are you?

JILL

I won't be here much longer. The

doctor and his wife are coming home

soon.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

I know.

JILL

Can you see me?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Yes.

JILL

(turning toward the

window)

I'm sorry I turned the lights down.

It didn't work anyway. I can turn

them back up if you like --

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Don't.

JILL

Don't?

(beat)

You've really scared me. Is that

what you wanted?

(beat)

Is that what you wanted?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

No.

JILL

What do you want?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Your blood... all over me.

JILL

You don't know me. You don't know

who I am or where I live. I'll get

Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him

or the police.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

You've called the police?

JILL

I want to talk to you.

JILL

Leave me alone!

SACKER (O.S.)

Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen

to me!

(beat)

We've traced the call. It's coming

from within the house. A squad car's

on its way over there now... just

get out of that house!

CLIFFORD

Are the parents here yet?

COP'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes

ago.

CLIFFORD

Christ!

(beat)

What a homecoming!

COP'S VOICE (O.S.)

They wanted to talk to someone. I

asked them to wait until you got

here. Come on in.

GARBER

We were only a block away when the

call went out. When we got here, the

guy was still waiting upstairs in

the children's bedroom. He was covered

with blood.

CLIFFORD

Blood?

GARBER

Not his own. The children had been

dead for several hours.

CLIFFORD

Jesus...

GARBER

He'd been using an old phone in their

bedroom that the parents had never

had disconnected.

CLIFFORD

Who is he?

GARBER

We found a Merchant Seaman's card on

him. He's English. Entered the country

less than a week ago.

CLIFFORD

How about the babysitter?

GARBER

She's going to be all right.

FADE OUT:

4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978

CUT TO:

MASTER

So you're in business for yourself

now.

CLIFFORD

(quietly)

Yes, sir, for the past three and a

half years.

MASTER

That's good.

(beat)

And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's

escape?

CLIFFORD

Oh, yes.

MASTER

Do you think the police will... find

him?

CLIFFORD

I know they haven't assigned anyone

to it specifically. It's an old case.

MASTER

(a tinge of bitterness)

An old case.

(beat)

Can you find him?

CLIFFORD

Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not

this week, but I'll find him.

MASTER

He could be anywhere by now.

CLIFFORD

I don't think so... because he's a

foreigner. He'll come back to the

city. After six years in confinement,

it's the only place that's familiar

to him. That's important.

MASTER

A man murders two children in cold

blood. A jury declares him insane.

How could such a person not be?

MASTER

He is sent to a state mental

institution where the security is...

less than perfect. And he escapes.

It... it isn't fair.

MANDRAKIS

A thing like that should never be

allowed to happen again.

CLIFFORD

I couldn't agree with you more.

MANDRAKIS

Go ahead then. My accountant will

contact you.

CLIFFORD

Thank you.

(beat)

How is Mrs. Mandrakis?

MANDRAKIS

She is... unable to have any more

children.

CLIFFORD

I'm sorry. Please give her my best.

MANDRAKIS

Of course.

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Curt Duncan isn't going to run right

out and kill more children. I'm not

worried about that.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

We had him for six years... under

continuous therapy, some of it rather

forceful...

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

...and drugs... tranquilizers

depressants, lithium...

DR. MONK

Eventually, anyone will respond to

the treatment here.

CLIFFORD

You gave him electric shock?

DR. MONK

Yeah, we zapped him a few times.

It's fairly standard.

CLIFFORD

It says here thirty-eight... thirty-

eight times.

CLIFFORD

What will happen to him now, without

the drugs he was on?

DR. MONK

There'll be some deterioration. That's

inevitable, but we can't say how

much.

CLIFFORD

During the time that you had him

here, did you discover any particular

habits of his, peculiarities, quirks,

anything that might help me find

him?

DR. MONK

(shrugging again)

It's all in the folder.

CLIFFORD

Any letters from people back in

England? Family?

DR. MONK

That, too, is in the folder.

CLIFFORD

Let's get something straight here,

Doctor. I've been 33 years in the

business of tracking people down and

putting them away. I spent almost a

year on Curt Duncan alone, with the

trial, the testimonies, the background

investigations. I didn't come here

today to look in your goddamn folders.

In fact, I wouldn't have come here

at all if you'd done your job right.

DR. MONK

Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital,

not a penitentiary. Everything that

pertains to one of our patients is

meticulously recorded in that

patient's folder... whether you can

make sense of it or not.

DR. MONK

Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-

schizophrenic. They see themselves

as victims, and they always blame

other people for the way they are.

When Duncan killed the Mandrakis

kids, it wasn't an act of hostility

against the children but against

their parents. He was getting back

at his own parents for traumas he

suffered in early childhood. The

criminal side of Curt Duncan is one

of terrible, symbolic vengeance.

CLIFFORD

(looking up)

Assuming he isn't found right away...

what will happen to him?

DR. MONK

I think you'll find him. Somebody

will find him. He can't function out

there. He'll make a mistake.

(turning to face

Clifford)

This is where he belongs. After six

years in here, he's suddenly gone

out to confront the world again. I

think he's in for a bit of a shock.

CUT TO:

RETIRED MAN

Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?

BILL

(over his shoulder)

Doin' all right.

HANK

C'mon in and shut the door.

HANK

(after a moment)

What'll it be?

(pause, no answer)

Hey! What'll it be?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

What kind of clothes was he wearing...

when he escaped?

CUT TO:

DR. MONK

Ordinary street clothes. Not all of

our patients have to wear the green

Gucci gowns.

CLIFFORD

Did he have any money with him?

DR. MONK

Probably. But not more than, say,

fifty dollars. Some of the patients

are given little jobs around the

ward, for which they are paid. It's

part of the rehabilitation.

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

(reading)

What's Guy du Mar--

DR. MONK (O.S.)

(pronouncing it

correctly)

Guy du Marraux syndrom.

DR. MONK

It's a psycho-motor dysfunction.

CLIFFORD

Duncan had it?

DR. MONK

Only from time to time, which is

unusual.

CLIFFORD

What is it?

DR. MONK

It attacks the nervous system. People

suffering from it are irresistibly

compelled to utter obscenities,

sometimes one, sometimes a whole

string of them. They can't control

it.

CLIFFORD

(somewhat taken aback)

Are you being serious?

DR. MONK

Yeah. Here, I'll give you an example.

DR. MONK

Duncan never had the twitch that

sometimes goes with it. And with

Duncan, as I said, the disease would

only manifest itself in periods of

extreme anxiety. When he was really

flipping out, in other words.

CLIFFORD

Duncan was Catholic?

DR. MONK

Yeah.

(beat)

So am I.

CLIFFORD

(mildly surprised)

That makes three of us.

DR. MONK

Is that right? So we all share the

same guilt.

DR. MONK

Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly

after he was admitted here in 1972.

DR. MONK (O.S.)

-- to put the situation right. The

hypodermic needles are only used to

give you medication that will calm

you down. They make you feel good,

relaxed. All right?

(no answer)

We're not putting anything in your

food either. The food is just food.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

(extremely agitated)

No. I don't eat the food. It doesn't

taste right.

DR. MONK

(to Clifford)

That's Duncan.

DR. MONK (O.S.)

Curt, why are you fidgeting? Can't

you get comfortable?

DUNCAN (O.S.)

No, I'm not comfortable!

DR. MONK (O.S.)

Wait a -- Hey!

(to someone else)

Hold him down there. Grab him! Never

mind the chair!

DR. MONK (O.S.)

(periodically

interjecting)

Pull him down... That's right...

Just lay him out... Lay him right

out... Steady... Pull out his knees...

DISSOLVE TO:

TRACY

(sotto voce)

A little action for your game?

BILL

(sotto voce)

What, him?

TRACY

I wouldn't bet against you.

BILL

What's the matter? You don't like me

playing with myself?

DUNCAN

Hi.

DUNCAN

What you been up to?

TRACY

(looking at him)

My own business.

(beat)

Thanks for the light. Okay?

DUNCAN

Next round's on me.

TRACY

(annoyed)

Listen, mister, I've got my own money.

So, if you don't mind...

DUNCAN

After what I been through, I don't

mind anything.

DUNCAN

See, that's the whole point. My

mind... Your mind... Where do they

fit in? You know what I mean?

DUNCAN

(setting her drink

before her)

Do you live around here?

TRACY

Get offa me!!

DUNCAN

(rapidly)

Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I

don't live around here. See -- ?

BILL (O.S.)

I think the lady wants to be left

alone.

BILL

I think an apology is in order.

BILL

That the best you can do?

BILL

I think you'd better just move along,

pal.

HANK

He'll be okay now, Bill. He just --

BILL

No! I want him out of here!

BILL

(to Duncan)

Go on, beat it.

BILL

I'm not going to say it again, mister.

BILL

Who're you calling?

BILL

(calling after her)

You're welcome, baby!

BILL

(to Hank)

Okay?

OLD MAN

Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh,

Bill?

HANK

(apologetic)

A fight breaks out, there's gonna be

damages. Insurance company doesn't

pay without a police report...

BILL

You see any damages?

BILL

See ya 'round.

HANK

(into phone)

No, it's over now...

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN

(calling out)

Donna. Donna! Hey!

(under his breath)

What the hell -- !

GARBER

(genuinely surprised)

What is all this?!

SCATTERED VOICES

Happy birthday, Charlie!

WOMAN'S VOICE

Look at him!

MAN'S VOICE

Don't shoot us, Charlie!

GARBER

(chagrined)

How was I supposed to know?

CUT TO:

GARBER

Will you tell me what this is about,

Cliff?

CLIFFORD

Yeah, in a minute.

GARBER

I don't think I can take any more of

these surprises.

GARBER

Okay now, what's the big deal?

CLIFFORD

Stand still. I want you to remember

this in the morning.

GARBER

If you want me to remember something

in the morning, then tell it to me

in the morning.

CLIFFORD

Charlie, come on.

GARBER (O.S.)

All right, all right. What is it?

You're getting married.

CLIFFORD

No. I got a job today, tracking

someone.

GARBER

That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll

find your man.

CLIFFORD

It's Curt Duncan.

GARBER

What?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

You didn't know he got out?

CLIFFORD

I need your cooperation on this one.

GARBER

Sure. Anything.

CUT TO:

TRACY

Oh, it's you!

(beat)

What do you want?

DUNCAN

(moving forward)

...Came to apologize. I...

TRACY

Look, I'm the one who should be sorry.

I didn't want that to happen.

(she sees his face;

shudders)

Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all

right.

DUNCAN

I'm new in town. Don't know anybody...

TRACY

(uncomfortable)

Where're you from?

DUNCAN

(coughs)

New York. Ever been there?

TRACY

Sure. Sure I've been there.

DUNCAN

Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone

cold, unfriendly...

TRACY

(over her shoulder)

Excuse me.

TRACY (O.S.)

Hello?...

TRACY

(nervous)

...No, I just got in... I don't know

if I can... Listen, I can't talk

now. Can I call you back?... Okay...

Goodbye.

DUNCAN

I'm not from New York, actually. But

I'm very, very far from home.

TRACY

Look, you can't come in here.

DUNCAN

(mumbling)

I thought we might get some coffee.

Can I buy you -- ?

TRACY

I don't think so.

DUNCAN

Someplace nearby?

TRACY

Not tonight. You'd better go.

DUNCAN

I got no place to go.

TRACY

(anxious)

You can't --

DUNCAN

Just, just a little coffee?

TRACY

Maybe tomorrow.

DUNCAN

Okay, tomorrow. When?

TRACY

I said maybe. I don't know.

(beat)

Listen, I'm sorry about this

afternoon. I really am. All right?

That was my boyfriend on the phone.

He's coming over. So please leave.

Now.

DUNCAN

I like you.

TRACY

(her voice rising)

Look, do you want me to call the

cops?

DUNCAN

(standing)

It's okay. It's okay.

DUNCAN

I'll see you later... sometime. I

still want to buy you that drink.

CUT TO:

CLIFFORD

Jesus, I don't recognize anybody.

GARBER

Three years is a long time in a place

like this.

CLIFFORD

Three and a half.

WC

Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?

CLIFFORD

(taken aback)

Hi...

GARBER

How long will you be here?

CLIFFORD

Depends on how lucky I get.

(beat)

I'll only be coming around once,

maybe twice a week.

GARBER

You want to use your old desk?

Someplace to sit down?

CLIFFORD

(surprised)

Is it vacant?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAINTENANCE MAN

Okay, man, move it out. Let's go.

CHEATER

Wha -- ?

OLD WOMAN

There's another one down there.

MAINTENANCE MAN

Hey!

MAINTENANCE MAN

(nudging again)

Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake --

Jesus Christ! What happened to you?

MAINTENANCE MAN (O.S.)

You get hit by a truck or what?

MAINTENANCE MAN

I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay

in here. Go out to the park, lay in

the sunshine. You'll feel better.

Okay?

MAINTENANCE MAN

God bless it! Hey!

MAINTENANCE MAN

Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.

CHEATER

(angry)

All right! All right!

CHEATER

Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a

bone. You got any money?

CHEATER

You neither, huh?

(with a laugh)

My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P.

Guess I better go to work. Take 'er

easy now, pardner.

CUT TO:

TRACY

Who is it?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

My name's John Clifford. I'm a private

investigator.

TRACY

A what?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

A private detective.

TRACY

What do you want with me?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

I'd just like to talk, ask a few

questions.

TRACY

I've got nothing to say about anything

or anybody.

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty

minutes with a search warrant and a

handful of cops, and I can probably

have you arrested, whether or not

the charges would stick. Now do you

want to let me in and talk?

TRACY

Have you got a badge?

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

I'll show you a badge when you open

the goddamn door!

CLIFFORD

I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a

license, a piece of paper, and I

left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?

CLIFFORD

Can we sit down?

CLIFFORD

Do you recognize this man?

TRACY

Why?

CLIFFORD

He's escaped from the insane asylum.

In 1972, he murdered two children...

broke into a house and found them

asleep in bed. It was a little boy,

five an a half, and a little three-

year-old girl. After the coroner's

investigation, their bodies were

taken to the mortuary, where the

undertaker took one look at them and

said he couldn't have their bodies

reconstructed for the funeral without

six days of steady work. Then he

asked what had been the murder weapon,

because looking at the mess in front

of him, he couldn't imagine what had

been used. The coroner told him there

had been no murder weapon. The killer

had used only his hands.

(beat)

The undertaker went to work and had

them done in four.

CLIFFORD

What's the matter?

TRACY

(barely able to say

it)

He's been here.

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

Do you think he'll try to see you

again?

TRACY (O.S.)

I don't know. He said he had no place

else to go.

CLIFFORD

Let's play it safe. Let's assume

that he will.

CLIFFORD (O.S.)

Will you work with me?

CUT TO:

HANK

You again?

CLIFFORD

What are your hours tonight?

HANK

No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays.

CLIFFORD

I want you to be open if that's

possible.

HANK

(closing the door)

No way. Monday's my night off. Come

back tomorr...

CLIFFORD

(through clenched

teeth)

This is tomorrow! Now what are your

hours?

CUT TO:

GARBER

(looking up)

Any luck?

CLIFFORD

I've come to say goodbye, and thank

you.

GARBER

You found him?

CLIFFORD

I think so.

GARBER

Where?

CLIFFORD

From here on, I go it alone.

GARBER

What's the point of chancing it,

Cliff? We'll let you take the credit.

CLIFFORD

No.

CLIFFORD

I'm going to kill him, Charlie.

CLIFFORD

The closer I get to this guy, the

more I... It gets to me. I don't

know...

GARBER

I think you'd better go on home,

Cliff. You've fallen in.

CLIFFORD

No. Not this time. This is the case

that makes up for a whole career. If

you can't understand it now, you

will in a few years.

GARBER

What part does money play in all

this? Play straight with me.

CLIFFORD

(shrugging)

For what I'm being paid, it's not

out of line.

GARBER

Who's hired you for this?

GARBER

(cynically)

So you're a hitman now.

CLIFFORD

(passionately)

He murdered two kids in cold blood.

You were there, too.

GARBER

You could get busted.

CLIFFORD

I understand that.

GARBER

What are you going to use?

CLIFFORD

Jimmy needles.

GARBER

You're stretching our friendship,

Cliff. If you blow this at all --

CLIFFORD

You'll never hear from me again.

GARBER

Take your time. Do it right.

CLIFFORD

Don't worry.

GARBER

Do you need any help preparing for

this thing?

CLIFFORD

(standing up)

I'm ready. I'm just trying to think

where he could be in the meantime.

English fella. Name's Crazy Curt.

Any of you guys seen him?

CLIFFORD

I owe him some money.

CHEATER

Aaahh. Show me an honest man...

CLIFFORD

(gesturing)

Stands about so. Brown hair. Face

kind of banged up. Was in an accident.

CHEATER

Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy,

not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad.

Crazy Curt, huh?

CLIFFORD

Where?

CHEATER

Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see

him again though. Tell you what. You

leave the money with me, I'll see he

gets it... as a favor to you.

CLIFFORD

I have to talk to him.

CHEATER

Whatsa matter? You don't trust me?

I'll have you know I used to be a

college professor. We can work

together.

CLIFFORD

Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.

whispering)

No luck. You see him?

CLIFFORD

He still could be out there, though.

TRACY

(softly)

Oh, God...

CLIFFORD

Are you all right?

TRACY

I'm okay.

CLIFFORD

I'm going to hang around outside for

awhile. I'll be back on and off again

all night.

CLIFFORD

Are you sure you're okay?

TRACY

I'm fine.

CLIFFORD

All right. Bolt your door. Don't let

anybody in, no matter what.

TRACY

Okay.

CLIFFORD

I'll be seeing you.

Listen. Thanks.

I'm not going to hurt you.

TRACY

I look at where I am now. I know I

could've done better, but... it's

too late for that.

CLIFFORD

(quietly)

I know.

TRACY

Well, you've got to keep looking, I

suppose.

CLIFFORD

I don't think he'll come back here.

CLIFFORD

(extending his hand)

Thanks... for all your help.

CLIFFORD

I know it wasn't easy.

(turning to go)

Maybe, someday, I'll be able to...

TRACY

I wish you wouldn't leave me

altogether...

TRACY

(with a laugh)

I'm not a young woman anymore. I've

given up all my dreams of the future.

Now, I just want to make it to the

end. You know what I mean.

CLIFFORD

I'll be around.

Sure.

Congratulations.

Ugggh... wasn't it a dreadful picture?

JOHN

I thought it was nice.

JOHN

Are the kids asleep?

JILL

They will be soon.

(to Carol)

Give them about twenty minutes and

then take a peek -- but if Stevie

sees you, you'll have to tell him a

story.

Here's the number of the restaurant.

Call us if you need us. For police,

ambulance, any emergency like that,

Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart.

What's going on over there?

Nothing's going on.

JOHN

Is everything all right?

CAROL

Yes, there's nothing --

JOHN

Are you sure?

CAROL

Everything's fine. Why? What's --?

JOHN

Carol, listen to me very carefully.

If there's a man in the house, if

there's any reason why you can't

talk to me right now, just answer

yes to me over the phone. That's

all. If there's any danger of any

kind, just say yes.

CAROL

I don't understand what's happening.

What man in the house?

JILL

Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me

truthfully. When was the last time

you looked in on the children?

CAROL

About forty-five minutes ago.

Everything's fine. They were fast

asleep.

JOHN

Carol, I'm sorry about all the

hysterics. We're leaving the

restaurant now. We'll explain

everything when we get home. Before

we hang up, could you do just one

more thing for me, please?

CAROL

What?

JOHN

Would you go upstairs and, and check

on the children for me?

CAROL

Sure. Hold on.

POLICEMAN #1

What seems to be the problem here,

sir?

JOHN

(whispering)

Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a

second please, and I'll explain

everything.

JILL

Policeman)

I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter

seven years ago with the child killer.

JOHN

The babysitter. The guy got into the

house and killed the two children

upstairs.

POLICEMAN #2

(whispering)

Oh, yeah, I remember something about

that. A Greek doctor...

JOHN

That's right. That's the one.

It was in the seventh precinct...

off somehow. What's been going on?

JILL

What are you thinking about?

JOHN

If I ever get my hands on the guy

that made that call...

JILL

John, it wasn't a prank. I know that

voice.

JOHN

He disguised it though, didn't he?

Same as before?

JILL

I know that voice.

JILL

How can we just sit here?

JOHN

Look, we promised never to talk about

this.

JOHN

What are we supposed to do? Leave

town? Take the kids and lock ourselves

up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a

good night's sleep, and in the morning

we can rethink this whole thing.

JILL

Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm

not about to fall asleep.

JOHN

Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're

both here. The house is locked up.

The cops'll be just outside all night

long. We're safe now.

JILL

That's what they told me before.

JOHN

Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel

any better...

JOHN

I'll keep it right here beside me

all night. You know I'm a light

sleeper and a damn good shot. Are

you satisfied?

JILL

John, I'm sorry to be putting you

through all this.

JOHN

Hey, you're not putting me through

anything that you don't have to go

through yourself. I'm with you all

the way. Trust me. Okay?

JOHN

That's my girl.

JOHN (O.S.)

Now try to relax. We'll get some

sleep. You'll be surprised how

differently things will look in the

morning.

JILL

(complaining)

Honey...

JOHN (O.S.)

What?

JILL

Not so loud. You're going to wake

the children.

JOHN

(smiling)

Naw. Those kids'd sleep through an

earthquake. They're good kids.

(handing her the pills

and water)

Here, take a couple of these. They're

just what the doctor ordered.

JOHN (O.S.)

You know, I read somewhere about

this psychological thing called

hysterical delusion or hysterical

recall or something. It had to do

with how an event from your past can

sneak up on you sometimes and fool

you when it's only just a memory. I

don't know. We'll talk about it in

the morning. Maybe there's someone

we can see about that...
