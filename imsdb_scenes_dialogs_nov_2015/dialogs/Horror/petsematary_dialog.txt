DISSOLVE TO:

ELLIE CREED (voice)

Is this our new house, daddy?

LOUIS CREED (voice)

This is it.

LOUIS

So...what do you think?

RACHEL

It's gorgeous!

ELLIE

Am I really gonna have my own room?

LOUIS

Yes.

ELLIE

Yaay!

ELLIE (to RACHEL)

Is that a swing?

RACHEL

Yes, but the rope might be--

ELLIE

Yaay!

LOUIS

Let her go. It's cool.

RACHEL

Louis, the house is beautiful.

RACHEL

The Master of Disaster awakes.

LOUIS

And Buckaroo Banzai.

RACHEL

Come on--let's parole 'em.

RACHEL

Decided to wake up and see what home

looks like, huh?

ELLIE (voice)

Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!

RACHEL (irritated)

Not so high, Ellie! You don't know

how strong that rope is.

ELLIE (raptuous voice)

Wheee!

LOUIS

Ellie, you heard your m---

ELLIE

Wh--

LOUIS				RACHEL

Ellie! Are you all right?	Honey? Are you okay?

ELLIE

Hurrts! It hurrrrts!

LOUIS

Anyone who can scream that loud isn't

ready for intensive care just yet--

looks like she just skinned her knee.

GAGE

Hi-Durch!

CHURCH

Waow!

GAGE

Druck!

LOUIS (to RACHEL)

Would you get the first aid kit?

ELLIE (screaming)

Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the

stingy stuff, daddy!

RACHEL

Gage's gone!

LOUIS

Jesus, the road!

JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)

No you don't, my friend--not in

that road.

GAGE

Drucks!

JUD (low)

No shit, Sherlock.

RACHEL

Gage!

JUD (hands him to her)

He was headed for the road, looked

like. I corralled him for you, missus.

RACHEL

Thank you. Thank you so much.

LOUIS

Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.

JUD

Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.

RACHEL

I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving

the wandering minstrel boy, here.

JUD

No harm, no foul. But you want to watch

out for that road. Those damn trucks go

back and forth all day and most of the

night.

JUD

Who might you be, little Miss?

ELLIE

I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642

Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)

At least, I used to.

JUD

And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,

and your dad's gonna be the new doctor

up to the college, I hear, and I think

you're going to be just as happy as a

clam here, Ellen Creed.

ELLIE (to LOUIS)

Are clams really happy?

RACHEL

Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to

change this kid. It's nice to meet you.

JUD

Same here. Come over and visit when

you get the chance.

ELLIE (worries)

Daddy, do I really have to have the

stingy stuff?

LOUIS

No-I guess not.

ELLIE

Yayyy!

JUD (amused)

I guess your daughter there ain't

going to die after all.

LOUIS (also amused)

I guess not.

JUD

House has stood empty for too long.

It's damn good to see people in it again.

LOUIS

Hey--they actually found the place!

JUD

Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I

usually sit out on my porch of an evening

and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.

Come on over and join me, if you want.

LOUIS

Well, maybe I----

RACHEL (voice)

Louis, what's this?

FIRST MOVER

You Mr. Creed?

LOUIS

Yes. Just a second.

LOUIS

The movers--

RACHEL

Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does

it go?

LOUIS

I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw

the house, this field was under four feet

of snow.

RACHEL (smiling)

I bet Mr. Crandall knows!

JUD

Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and

a good walk, too. I'll take you up there

sometime, and tell you the story, too--

after you get settled in.

RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)

Kids are asleep, doc.

LOUIS

Great.

RACHEL

You're not really going over to have a

beer with that old guy, are you?

LOUIS

Well, I've got a million questions about

the area, and---

RACHEL

---and you'll end up doing a free

consultation on his arthritis or urinary

problems and---

LOUIS

Did you see his shirt?

RACHEL (giggles)

Sure. Bruce Springsteen.

LOUIS

I really do have a million questions

about the area...but the thing I'm

really curious about is how come this

octogenarian Yankee is decorating the

slumped remains of his pecs with the

Boss.

JUD (voice)

That you, doc?

LOUIS

It's me.

JUD

Well, come on up and have a beer.

JUD

You need a glass?

LOUIS

Not at all.

JUD

Good for you.

LOUIS

God, that's fine.

JUD

Ain't it just? The man who invented

beer, Louis, that man was having a

prime day for himself.

LOUIS

What were you listening to?

JUD

Allman Brothers.

LOUIS

What?

JUD

The Eat A Peach album. God, they were

good before drugs and bad luck caught

up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

JUD

I'm sorry. Wait.

JUD

Try that.

LOUIS

Nice.

JUD

I like rock and roll. No...I guess

that's too mild. I love it. Since

my ears started to die out on me,

it's the only music I can really hear.

And since my wife died...I dunno, some-

times a little rock and roll fills up

night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)

One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope

your time here will be a happy one.

LOUIS (great sincerity)

Thank you, Mr. Crandall.

LOUIS (wincing)

Jesus!

JUD (lights a cigarette)

That's one mean road, all right--you

remember that path your wife commented on?

LOUIS

The one that goes into the woods--sure.

JUD

That road--and those Orinco trucks--

are the two main reasons it's there.

LOUIS

What's at the end of it?

JUD (smiles)

Another day--after you get settled in a

bit. Meantime, doc---

JUD (continues)

Here's to your bones.

LOUIS

And yours.

LOUIS

Church! God, you scared the life

out of me!

CHURCH

Waow!

LOUIS (to the cat)

I know one thing that will keep you

home, good buddy.

JUD

Take a look behind you.

LOUIS

My God!

RACHEL

It's beautiful!

JUD

You folks ready to go on?

LOUIS

Sure.

ELLIE

But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?

JUD

You'll see soon enough, hon.

LOUIS

Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper

companies?

JUD

Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up

ahead is all that's left of their

tribal lands.

ELLIE (giggling)

Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.

JUD (smiles)

Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?

You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?

LOUIS

Not yet...how much further is it?

JUD

Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

JUD (stopping)

This is the place, honey.

ELLIE

What's it say, mommy?

RACHEL

It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's

misspelled, but...that's what it

says.

RACHEL

Ellen--!

RACHEL (a bit lame)

Be careful.

JUD

I told you it was a bad road,

Louis--it's killed a lot of pets

and made a lot of kids unhappy.

But at least something good come

of it. This place.

ELLIE (excited voice)

Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!

RACHEL

How can you call it a good thing?

A graveyard for pets killed in the

road! Built and maintained by broken-

hearted children!

JUD

Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't

quite that way, deah!

LOUIS

I think it's rather extraordinary.

RACHEL

Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.

JUD

Well...they have to learn about death

somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?

The little ones?

RACHEL (coldly)

Why?

JUD

Well...well, because--

ELLIE (voice)

Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

JUD (alarmed)

No, honey! You don't want to go

climbing on that! Come on down!

ELLIE

It's okay, Mr. Crandall--

LOUIS

Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?

ELLIE

Well, I thought it was safe--

JUD

Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns

like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.

ELLIE

Bite?

JUD

Ayuh.

RACHEL (calls)

Is she all right, Louis?

LOUIS (calls back)

Fine! Come and see!

RACHEL (calling)

I think I'll sit this one out, doc.

ELLIE

I want to look around, daddy--

may I?

LOUIS

For a little while.

ELLIE (voice)

Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!

LOUIS

I can hardly read these.

JUD

Ayuh--they get older as you go

toward the middle. (Points) Pete

LaVasseur's dog is buried there...

(points) the Stoppard boys' racing

pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat

got...and I think that's the cat

himself right there, although it's

been so many years I can't tell for

sure.

(calling)

Missy Ellen! Come over here just a

minute!

JUD

I see you're quite a reader for such

a little girl. Can you read that?

ELLEN

"Spot a good fellow we love you boy."

(Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."

Gee, I can't read the rest.

JUD

Last name's Crandall, little missy.

JUD

That's where I buried my dog Spot

when he died of old age in 19 and

14. Dug it good and deep. By the

time I finished, I had blisters all

over my hands and a hell of a crick

in my back. Soil's stony up here.

JUD

Do you know what this place is,

Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a

boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing

and even a whole pile of 'em don't

amount to much. Do you know what a

graveyard really is?

ELLIE

Well...I guess not.

JUD

It's a place where the dead speak,

Missy.

JUD

No--not right out loud. Their stones

speak...or their markers. Even if the

marker ain't nothing but a tin can

someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,

it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?

LOUIS

I think it is so, Ellie.

ELLIE

What if you can't read what's

written on there anymore?

JUD

Well, it still says some animal got

laid down here after, don't it?

ELLIE

Yes--

LOUIS

And that someone cared enough about

that animal to mark the spot.

ELLIE

To remember.

JUD (smiles)

Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary

place, Ellie. It's a place of rest

and speaking. Can you remember that?

ELLIE (a little awed)

Yes, sir.

RACHEL (calls)

Louis, can we go? I'm tired!

ELLIE

Mommy! This is a place where dead

animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!

RACHEL (soft)

Did he.

LOUIS

My wife is not crazy about cemeteries

of any kind. As you may have noticed.

JUD

Me neither. But I believe in knowing

your enemy.

LOUIS (voice)

Did we take too long?

RACHEL (curt)

Well, if supper's burned, I'm not

the one going out for pizza.

LOUIS (not looking around)

Hi, babe.

ELLIE

Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there

because of the road, isn't it?

ELLIE

That's what I think. I heard

Missy Dandridge tell Mom when

Church was fixed he wouldn't

cross the road so much.

LOUIS

Well, it's always better to take

precautions--but I'm sure Church

will be all right, honey...

ELLIE (voice)

No he won't! Not in the end! He won't

be all right in the end no matter how

you fix 'im!

ELLIE

In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?

LOUIS

Lovey...Church might be still alive when

you're in a high school...and that's a

very long time.

ELLIE

It doesn't seem long to me. It seems

short. I think the whole thing about

pets dying s-s-sucks!

LOUIS

If it was up to me I'd let Church live

to be a hundred...but I don't make up

the rules.

ELLIE (muffled)

Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's

not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get

His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not

mine! Not--

RACHEL

She's finally asleep.

LOUIS

She was a little over-excited,

that's all. Poor kid.

RACHEL

It was that place. That creepy cemetery

up in the woods. Whatever disease the

kids in this town have got, I don't want

Ellie to catch it.

LOUIS

Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?

RACHEL

Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,

crying as if her heart would break?

Here she is thinking Church is going to

die.

LOUIS

Rachel...someday Church is going to

die.

RACHEL (whirls on him)

That is hardly the point! Church is

not going to die today, or tomorrow--

Never mind. I can see you don't have

the slightest idea what I'm talking about.

LOUIS

Rachel--!

ELLIE

Yee-uck! Gross!

LOUIS

He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is

going to be beyond him for a few years.

ELLIE

I don't want him to get his nuts

cut, daddy! What if he dies?

LOUIS

Good God! Where'd you hear that?

ELLIE

Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a

operation!

RACHEL

Honey, Church will be fine.

ELLIE

But what if he dies and has to

go to the Pet Sematary?

RACHEL

Don't be silly. Church is not going

to die.

LOUIS

According to what Mr. Crandall says, the

road's a lot more dangerous than the

operation. Church will be just the same.

Well--almost the same--and we won't have

to worry about him getting turned into

catburgers by one of those damn Orinco

trucks.

RACHEL

That's enough of that kind of talk!

LOUIS

I just said--

RACHEL

I know what you just said. Ellie,

clear your place.

ELLIE (sets the plate down)

I'm scared. What if school here isn't

like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want

to go h-h-home!

RACHEL

You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be

excused. Go and wash your face.

LOUIS

And Church will be fine.

ELLIE (anxious)

Do you promise, Daddy?

LOUIS

Well, honey...you know that...

RACHEL

Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give

the little girl her promise.

LOUIS (reluctantly)

Church will be fine. I promise.

ELLIE

Yayyyy!

RACHEL

Thank you, Louis.

LOUIS

Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-

thing should go wrong while he's under

the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,

but it happens--you explain to her.

GAGE (conversationally)

Here, Durch!

RACHEL

Have a great day!

GAGE

Bye-bye!

MISSY

Gonna get his--

LOUIS

--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,

for introducing that colorful phrase

into my daughter's vocabulary.

MISSY

Don't mention it.

LOUIS (sees this)

How's that belly-ache of yours?

MISSY (gets the sheets)

No better and no worse.

LOUIS

You ought to see a doctor about it.

MISSY

It'll pass. They always do.

RACHEL (anxious)

Still friends, doc?

RACHEL

Thank God. I was a little worried

there. Have a great first day at

school, doc. No broken bones.

LOUIS (smiles)

Not so much as a sprain.

CHARLTON

Holy Jesus.

(turns)

Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,

we've got a mess here! Stat!

GIRL

Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!

LOUIS (to CHARLTON)

Get her out. Get them all out.

GIRL (struggling)

No! No! He can't die! He can't die!

LOUIS

Steve, get the ambulance over here

right now. He's got to go to EMMC.

STEVE

The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco

downtown, getting--

LOUIS

--a new muffler, oh shit--

CANDYSTRIPER

I can't look at it...I can't stand it...

CHARLTON (slaps her)

Yes you by God can. Go get the hard

stretcher!

LOUIS

Help me hold him.

STEVE

It wouldn't matter if we did have

the ambulance.

LOUIS

It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.

LOUIS

He's going. Steve, go call the motor-

pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.

CHARLTON

It won't--

LOUIS

I know it won't! But let's for God's

sake do it by the rules!

LOIS

There wasn't even supposed to be a

sprain today, my friend--that's what

I told her.

PASCOW

...Pet Sematary...

LOUIS (whispers)

W-What did you say...?

PASCOW

It's not the real cemetery...

(Long pause) The soil of a man's

heart is stonier, Louis...a man

grows what he can...and tends it.

LOUIS

How do you know my name?

PASCOW (gurgling)

I'll come...to you.

LOUIS (low but urgent)

Dammit, how do you know my name?

STEVE

Louis, they're sending a--

LOUIS (snaps)

Help me!

LOUIS (to CHARLTON)

Never mind. He's going.

LOUIS

Steve, will you get a sheet to cover

him with?

RADIO (voice-over)

Tragedy struck on the first day of the

University of Maine's fall semester

when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old

sophomore--

LOUIS

He said my name. I heard it. He

said my name.

PASCOW

Come on, doc. We got places to go.

PASCOW

Come on, doc--don't make me tell you

twice.

LOUIS (relieved)

Oh. Thank God.

PASCOW (Voice)

Hurry up, doc.

PASCOW (low)

Come on, doc...

PASCOW

Let's go, doc.

LOUIS (moans)

I don't like this dream.

PASCOW

Who said you were dreaming?

PASCOW

This is the place where the dead speak.

LOUIS

I want to wake up. I want to wake up,

that's all. I--

PASCOW

The door must not be opened. The

barrier must not be crossed. Don't

go on, doc. No matter how much you

feel you have to. There's more

power here than you know.

LOUIS

Please, I want to wake up. Leave me

alone. It's not my fault you died; you

were as good as dead when they brought

you in--

PASCOW

The power of this place is old and

always restless. Sometimes the dead

do more than speak. Remember, doc.

LOUIS

Leave me alone!

PASCOW

Remember.

RADIO (voice)

--another beautiful day in Maine!

This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that

the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.

Temps are going all the way up to 70...

We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's

"Sheena."

RACHEL (calls)

You up, doc?

LOUIS

Getting there.

RACHEL

I got eggs down here!

LOUIS

Good d--

LOUIS (voice)

Hello?

JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)

Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of

trouble.

LOUIS (frowning)

Jud? What trouble?

JUD

Did you tell me Rachel took the

kids back to Chicago for a few days?

LOUIS

For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't

go because her old man thinks I'm a

shit and the feeling is heartily re-

ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow

night. Jud, what's this about?

JUD

Well, there's a dead cat over here on

the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it

might be your daughter's.

LOUIS

Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

JUD (voice)

Well?

LOUIS

It's Church.

JUD

I'm sorry. At least it don't look like

he suffered.

LOUIS

Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.

JUD

Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?

LOUIS

Yes.

LOUIS

Bagged cat. What a mess.

JUD

You going to bury him in the Pet

Sematary?

LOUIS (a little bitter)

I guess that's what it's there for, huh?

JUD

Going to tell Ellie?

LOUIS

I don't know.

JUD

Seems like you told me about a promise

you made--

RACHEL (impatiently)

Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the

little girl her promise.

LOUIS (defensive)

That was a mistake. But Rachel...

she doesn't like to talk about

death, or even think of it. Her

younger sister died of spinal

meningitis when Rachel was eight.

Rachel was there when it happened.

Alone. I guess you could say it

made a complex.

JUD

Cat's just as dead, Louis.

LOUIS (snaps)

Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm

sorry, Jud.

JUD

No need to apologize.

LOUIS

Maybe when they call I'll just tell

Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat

around. You know?

JUD (after a long pause)

Maybe there's a better way.

LOUIS

Jud, this is crazy. It's going to

be almost dark before we get back.

JUD

It's going to be dark before we even

get where we're going, Louis. But

we can do it...and we're going to.

LOUIS

But--

JUD

Does she love the cat?

LOUIS

Yes, but--

JUD

Then come on.

LOUIS

Well, folks, here we are, in Louis

Creed Dreamland.

JUD

What say, Louis?

LOUIS

Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on

the outer circle or start a new one?

JUD

We're still not where we're going.

LOUIS

What do you mean?

JUD

The place we're going is on the

other side of that.

LOUIS

We can't climb over that. We'll break

our necks!

JUD

No. We won't. I have climbed it a time

or two before, and I know all the places

to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't

look down...and don't stop. If you stop,

you'll crash through for sure.

LOUIS

I'm not climbing that.

JUD

Give me the cat. I'll take care of it

myself.

LOUIS

Let's go.

LOUIS (low)

Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.

LOUIS

God, this is amazing!

JUD

Just don't stop and--

LOUIS

And don't look down. Right.

LOUIS (amazed)

Holy...!

JUD (turns to look)

Come on, Louis--don't stop!

LOUIS (grinning)

I'm all right! I'm f--

JUD

Louis! You all right?

LOUIS (dazed)

Sure. I guess I just lost my happy

thoughts for a second there.

LOUIS (continues)

I shouldn't have stopped...and it

does bite.

JUD

No, you shouldn't have stopped. But

you got away with it. Important thing

is are you sure you're all right?

LOUIS

Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?

JUD

You'll see before long. Let's go.

DISSOLVE TO:

JUD

This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--

you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow

me and don't look down.

JUD

Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.

LOUIS

Is there quicksand?

JUD

Ayuh.

LOUIS (nervous; joking)

Are there ghosts?

JUD

Ayuh.

JUD

There's a lot of funny things down

this way, Louis.

LOUIS

You're telling me.

JUD (still walking)

The air's heavier...more electrical...

something. You might see St. Elmo's

Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'

It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.

LOUIS

It's funny, all right.

JUD

Just don't stop, Louis. You don't

ever want to stop down here in

Little God. (Pause) And you don't

ever want to look behind you,

whatever you hear.

JUD

Almost there, Louis.

LOUIS

You keep saying that.

JUD

This time I mean it.

LOUIS (awed)

What is this place?

JUD

This was their burying ground, Louis.

LOUIS

Whose burying ground?

JUD

The Micmac Indians. I brought you here

to bury Ellen's cat.

LOUIS

Why? For God's sake, why?

JUD

I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.

All right?

LOUIS

I guess so...but...

JUD

You want to rest a bit before you start?

LOUIS

No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to

dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

JUD

Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.

JUD

I'm going to sit over yonder and have a

smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to

do it yourself. Each buries his own.

That's how it was done then.

JUD (voice)

Should be deep enough.

LOUIS

You think so?

LOUIS

What are those for?

JUD

Your cairn.

LOUIS

Doesn't look like they last long.

JUD

Don't worry about that.

LOUIS

Jud, why am I doing all this?

JUD

Because it's right.

LOUIS

Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You

were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if

you were worth all this aggravation,

but you were a hell of a good cat.

JUD

That's fine. You did real good.

LOUIS

Oh, shit! Rachel!

JUD (voice)

Louis.

JUD

When you talk to 'em, not one word

about what we done tonight. 'S'far's

you know, the cat's still fine.

JUD

You'll understand. In the meantime,

keep your peace. What we did, Louis,

was a secret thing. Women are supposed

to be the ones who are good at

keeping secrets, but any woman who

knows anything at all would tell you

she's never seen into a man's heart.

The soil of a man's heart is stonier,

Louis--like the soil up there in the

old Micmac burying ground. A man

grows what he can...and tends it.

LOUIS

But--

JUD

No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.

What we done was right. Another time

it might not be, but tonight it was...

at least I hope to Christ it was. Now

you make your call...but not a word

about tonight.

DORY GOLDMAN (voice)

Goldman residence.

LOUIS

Hi, Dory...it's Louis--

RACHEL (voice)

You want to talk to the birthday girl?

LOUIS

That'd be real fine.

ELLIE (voice)

Hi...daddy?

LOUIS (sings)

Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday

to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy

birthday to you!

ELLIE (voice)

That was awful, daddy.

LOUIS

Yeah, I know...how are things out

there in Chicagoland?

ELLIE

Fine...except when Mom was airing

Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and

got into Grampa's study and pooped in

Grampa's favorite chair.

LOUIS (grinning broadly)

Way to go, Gage!

ELLIE (voice)

What?

LOUIS

I said that's too bad. What did you

get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?

ELLIE (voice)

Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and

a Chatty Cathy doll...

ELLIE

...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,

dad? Does he miss me?

LOUIS

Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.

I haven't seen him this evening, but--

ELLIE

Well, make sure you put him down

cellar before you go to bed so he

can't run out in the road and get

greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.

LOUIS (voice)

Yuck! Kiss your own cat!

ELLIE

Want to talk to Gage?

LOUIS (calls)

Church?

LOUIS

Food, Church...food!

LOUIS

Come on, Church! Chow down!

LOUIS (to himself)

Christ. I don't believe this.

LOUIS (wincing)

God, you stink, Church.

LOUIS

In a second.

LOUIS

Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded

Christ, he ch--

LOUIS

Ow!

LOUIS

What did we do?

JUD

I most generally don't start before

noon, but this looks like an exception.

LOUIS

What did we do, Jud?

JUD

Why, saved a little girl from being

unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!

LOUIS

I tried to tell myself I buried him

alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets

Felix the Cat. But...

JUD

Wouldn't wash?

LOUIS

No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I

see it, and Church was dead. He smells

horrible and he uses his claws, but

he's alive...and I feel like I'm going

crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?

JUD

Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about

the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids

just called him Stanny B. He was half

Micmac himself.

LOUIS

Can I have another one?

JUD

I guess it wouldn't hurt.

JUD

The Micmacs used to bury their dead

up there long before the whites came.

JUD

They buried their dead and for a long

time their dead stayed buried. Then

something happened. Half the tribe died

in a season. The rest moved on. They

said a Wendigo had soured the ground.

LOUIS

Wendigo?

JUD

Spirit of the north country. Not a good

spirit. Wendigos are great liars and

tricksters, according to the stories.

And if one touches you...

JUD

Maybe it really was a Wendigo--

I ain't the one to say it wasn't--

or maybe it was just some disease.

Whatever the reason, those that were

left moved on. But they left that

place...the way it is now.

JUD (voice)

I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot

died, I thought I was gonna die.

LOUIS

You and this old Indian rag-man--

JUD

Stanny B. did for me what I did for

you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't

alone when Spot came back.

JUD (voice)

My mother was with me.

JUD (voice)

He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.

You could still see the marks on him.

JUD'S MOM (dim; far)

Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the

ground you buried him in! Come here

and get your dog!

JUD'S MOM (terror)

COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!

LOUIS

How did your mother take it, Jud?

How did she take it when your dog

came back from the dead?

JUD

Well, she was a little upset at first,

and that's why I thought you ought to

hold your peace when you talked to

your people last night...you did, didn't

you, Louis?

LOUIS

Yes.

JUD

Why, then, things should be fine.

LOUIS

A little upset is all she was? Because

I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a

little like a nuclear reactor on the

edge of a meltdown.

JUD

She got used to the idea. Spot lived

another four years. He died peacefully

in the night that second time, and I

buried him in the Pet Sematary...where

his bones still lie.

LOUIS (voice)

You still haven't told me why you

did it.

JUD

A man doesn't always know why he does

things, Louis. I think I did it because

your daughter ain't ready for her

favorite pet to die.

LOUIS

What?

JUD

Ellie's a little scared of death. And

the main reason Ellie's that way is

because your wife is a lot scared of

death. Now you just go ahead and tell

me I'm wrong.

RACHEL

Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give

the little girl her promise.

PASCOW

The door must not be opened. The

barrier must not be crossed.

LOUIS

You don't understand--

LOUIS (mutters)

--I'm a doctor.

PASCOW

Sometimes the dead do more than speak.

Remember, doc.

RACHEL (with great force)

Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.

Promise me. Promise me.

LOUIS

Promise...

JUD (to LOUIS)

You do it for all the best reasons,

but that ain't why. You do it because

it gets hold of you...you do it

because you have to.

LOUIS

How the hell did you get in?

ELLIE

Daddy!

LOUIS

Hi, sugar!

ELLIE

Daddy, is Church all right?

LOUIS

Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping

on the front porch when I left.

ELLIE

Cause I had a bad dream about him.

I dreamed he got hit by a car and

you and Mr. Crandall buried him in

the Pet Sematary.

LOUIS (trying to smile)

That was a silly dream, wasn't it?

ELLIE

Is he really all right?

LOUIS

Yes.

ELLIE

Because you promised.

LOUIS

I know.

RACHEL

Want to take your son, doc?

ELLIE (entering)

Can cats have shampoos?

RACHEL

Yes--you have to take them to someone

who grooms animals, though. I think

it's pretty expensive.

ELLIE (still upset)

I don't care. I'll save up my allowance

and pay for it. Church smells bad.

LOUIS

I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up

the money, Ellen.

ELLIE

I hate that smell.

LOUIS

Yes--I hate it, too.

ELLIE

They're all turning on their lights!

Daddy, why are they all turning on

their lights in the middle of the day?

JUD

They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.

ELLIE

Is that right, dad?

LOUIS

Yes. To honor the dead.

MINISTER (voice)

May the Lord bless you and keep you;

may the Lord make his face to shine

upon you, and comfort you, and lift

you up, and give you peace. Amen.

JUD

Rachel not feeling well?

LOUIS

Well...a touch of the flu...

ELLIE

She's in bed. She was throwing up.

Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said

Missy--

LOUIS

That's enough, Ellen.

JUD

Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.

LOUIS

This babe has said enough.

LOUIS

Hop in, Ellie.

JUD

Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to

hear. I remember when she was

no older'n Ellen there, walking down

to the store with her Raggedy Anne

doll draggin' behind her in the dust.

I don't know why God takes someone

like her, who should have a bunch of

years still in front of them, and lets

an old shit like me just go on and on.

LOUIS

My father used to have a saying, Jud--

"God sees the truth, but waits."

JUD

Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

LOUIS

It's Ellie's cat.

JUD

Nope. He's your cat now.

LOUIS

Ellie? What's wrong?

ELLIE

No more chocolate chip cookies.

LOUIS

Huh?

ELLIE

Missy made the best chocolate chip

cookies in the world--even Mom said

so. Now there won't be any more

because she's gonna be dead forever!

NEWSCASTER

Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems

almost beyond doubt: the dead are

returning to eat the living.

ELLIE (voice)

Daddy?

LOUIS

What's up, sugar?

ELLIE

Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge

went to heaven?

LOUIS

What?

ELLIE

At school Michael McDowell said she was

gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says

all sewersides fry in hell.

LOUIS

Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full

of shit he probably squeaks when he walks,

my dear.

LOUIS

But don't you dare say that.

ELLIE

I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you

think?

LOUIS

I don't know, honey. Different people

believe all sorts of different things

happen to us when we die. Some believe

in heaven or hell. Some think we're

born again as little children--

ELLIE

Sure, carnation. Like in that movie

you rented, Audrey Rose.

LOUIS

Well, it's actually reincarnation, but

you get the idea. And some people think

we just wink out...like a candle flame

when the wind blows hard.

ELLIE

Do you believe that?

LOUIS

I think we go on. I'm not sure

what happens after we die, but yeah--

I have faith in that.

ELLIE

You believe in it.

LOUIS

Oh, faith's a little more than just

believing.

LOUIS (continues)

I'll tell you what faith is--it's the

evidence of the heart; the assurance

of things not seen.

ELLIE

I don't get it.

LOUIS

Well, here we are, sitting in my

chair. Do you think my chair will

be here tomorrow?

ELLIE

Yeah, sure.

LOUIS

Then you have faith in that. But

we don't know it will be; after all,

some crazed chair-burglar might break

in while we're away and steal it, right?

LOUIS

But we plan on that chair. We believe

in that chair. And I plan on going on

somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.

I believe I will.

ELLIE (awed)

You have faith in that.

LOUIS

Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that

it is now time for Ellen Creed to get

ready for bed. So buzz.

ELLIE

I'm not tired!

LOUIS

I'm sure you're not.

ELLIE

Then why do I have to go to bed?

LOUIS

Because your mother and I need

the rest, sugar. Now buzz.

RACHEL

I heard you tonight.

LOUIS

I thought maybe you did. I know

you don't approve of the subject

being raised--

RACHEL

That's not true. The subject

scares me. Because of Zelda.

LOUIS

Your sister, I know.

RACHEL

Sometimes you're so good with her,

Louis--so straight with her--that

you make me ashamed of myself.

RACHEL

I'm sorry I couldn't go with you

to Missy's funeral. And that I

blew up when we went to that

silly animal graveyard.

LOUIS

That's forgotten.

RACHEL

Not by me, it isn't. I know how

badly I acted, how unfair I was.

It's just that I..you know.

LOUIS

Yes, I guess I do.

RACHEL

I'm going to try to do better.

LOUIS

You're doing fine.

DISSOLVE TO:

IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)

I knew something like this would happen.

IRWIN (voice continues)

I told her when you were first married.

'You'll have all the grief you can stand,

and more,' I said.

IRWIN (continues)

And now look at this!

IRWIN (weeping)

Run over in the road like a...a

chipmunk!

ELLIE (voice)

Go, daddy!

GAGE

Go, dayee!

LOUIS (voice)

Where's Rachel?

IRWIN (leaning forward)

With her mother! Where she should be!

As for you, I hope you rot in hell!

In hell, do you hear me?

LOUIS

Hey, Gage!

GAGE

Dat?

LOUIS

String! You're flying it,

Gage--you got the hammer, my man!

GAGE

Gage fline it?

LOUIS

Bet your boots. Look--

LOUIS

See?

GAGE

Gage fline it!!

LOUIS (tenderly)

Bet your ass, little hero.

IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)

Where were you while he was playing in

the road? Thinking about your stupid

medical articles? You stinking shit!

You killer of children!

IRWIN

You--

RACHEL

Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!

IRWIN

How do you like that, you son

of a bitch? I should have done

it sooner!

STEVE (getting up)

Hey!

IRWIN

How do you like that? How do--

MARCY

Stop them. Right now.

IRWIN

Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll

take y'apart!

STEVE

Stop it!

STEVE

Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with

you, Louis? It's your son's funeral,

not a boxing match!

PASCOW (voice)

The soil of a man's heart is stonier,

doc--

PASCOW

A man grows what he can...and tends it.

ELLIE

I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,

mommy!

RACHEL

In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his

turn.

IRWIN (voice)

Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry--

IRWIN

I don't know what happened to me.

Louis, please--

LOUIS (weeping)

I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry,

little hero.

ELLIE

It got away from him! That numb shit!

RACHEL (outraged)

Ellen Creed!

GAGE

Kite fline too fast!

LOUIS (shrugs, good-humored)

What can you d-

JUD

Don't let him go in the road, Louis!

RACHEL (screams)

Get him, Louis!

LOUIS (cups his ear)

What?

RACHEL (shrieks)

GET THE BABY!!

GAGE (cheerful)

Geddit-geddit-geddit!

GAGE (not afraid)

Druck!

LOUIS (shrieks)

NO!!

JUD (voice)

Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep.

JUD

Your father-in-law packs a wallop,

for an old guy. He and his wife gone

back to Chicago?

LOUIS

No...squatting out there at the

Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures.

He really thinks Rachel's going to go

back with them. Her and Ellie.

JUD

Louis--

ELLIE (coming to the table)

I want to go back to my own room.

I can't sleep with mommy. She

keeps stealing the covers.

JUD

What you got there, Ellie?

JUD (studying it)

Why that's real nice...you pullin'

him on a sled. Bet he liked that,

didn't he?

ELLIE (crying)

I used to pull 'im a lot.

ELLIE

I'm going to carry this picture,

Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage

come back.

JUD

Ellie...God doesn't do things like

that. I know you loved y'brother, but--

ELLIE

He can if He wants to. He can do

anything, just like Inspector Gadget

on TV. But I have to keep things ready

for him, that's what I think. I've got

his picture and I'm going to sit in

his chair--

LOUIS

Ellie--

ELLIE

And I'm going to eat his breakfast

cereal, too, even though it tastes

like boogers. And...and...

JUD

Louis, take care of your little

girl...she needs you.

LOUIS (kisses her)

Good night, Ellie.

ELLIE

G'night daddy.

ELLIE

God could take it back if He wanted

to, couldn't He? If He really, really

wanted to? Can I have faith in that?

LOUIS

Yes--I suppose you can. Good night,

Ellie.

LOUIS (low snarl)

Fuck off, hairball!!

LOUIS (slightly antagonistic)

I thought you'd be gone by now.

JUD

I got you a fresh beer out of the

fridge, Louis.

LOUIS

Jud, I buried my son today and

I'm very tired. I wonder if we

could just--

JUD

You're thinking of things best

not thought of, Louis.

LOUIS

I'm thinking about going to bed.

JUD

You never asked me if anyone had

buried a person up there in the

Micmac burying ground--

JUD

--but I think the thought

has crossed your mind.

LOUIS

Shit! Look at this mess!

JUD

Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.

JUD

I know the Micmacs thought it was a

holy place...and then they thought

it was a cursed place. That's why

they moved on.

LOUIS

Because something called a wendigo

soured the ground.

JUD

And because the dead walked.

JUD

Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've

been thinking of has been done.

JUD (voice over)

Timmy Baterman was on his way home

from the war with his Purple Heart

when he got killed in some stupid

car accident down in Georgia.

JUD (v-o continues)

Bill was bitter--his son had been in

the thick of it two years and then got

shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound.

He was supposed to be coming home safe

and sound. Instead, he come home in a

box after all.

JUD (v-o continues)

He wasn't able to get to the bottom

of the truth, Louis.

LOUIS

I'll bite--what's the bottom of the

truth, Jud?

JUD

Why...that sometimes dead is better.

That's all. Sometimes dead is better.

LOUIS (bitter)

Tell that to my wife and little girl.

JUD

It ain't your wife and little girl

that's got me worried, Louis.

JUD (voice-over)

Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as

I remember.

DISSOLVE TO:

JUD (v-o continues)

It was four or five days later when...

JUD (v-o continues)

...Margie Washburn seen him walking

up the road toward Yorkie's Livery.

JUD (v.o.)

Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman

walking back and forth between the

home place and the town line. But

it was Margie...

JUD (v.o. continues)

...who finally got up enough guts to

talk to the town fathers about it.

She knew it had to be stopped, Louis.

JUD (v.o. continues)

She knew it was an abomination.

George Anderson, the town postmaster,

was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal

Benson...and me. I was there.

BILL BATERMAN (voice)

Stop that, Timmy!

JUD

Come on.

ALAN

Oh holy Jesus lookit that.

BILL

You men get out of here!

JUD

I heard your boy was killed down

Georgia.

BILL (agitated)

That was a mistake!

HANNIBAL

Was it?

BILL

You see him standing there,

don't you? Now get out! Get the

Christ off my land!

TIMMY (laughing)

Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an!

GEORGE (revolted)

Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can

smell him!

BILL

He ain't dead! Give him a day or two

and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!

JUD

Bill, this ain't right--you can see

that yourself--

BILL (screaming)

GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!!

TIMMY (laughing)

Dead! We love dead! Hate living!

BILL (over his shoulder)

You want to get out of here before I get

my shotgun! You boys are trespassing!

JUD

God help you, Bill.

BILL (snarls)

God never helped me. I helped

myself.

LOUIS

What happened?

JUD (v.o.)

There was a fire.

BILL (voice)

Who's there?

TIMMY (laughing, screeching voice)

Ooo air? Ooo air?

JUD

Get out, Billy--the place is

going up.

BILL

I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!

ALAN

You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud?

JUD (stony)

If he don't, he don't.

BILL (struggling)

No! No, Timmy! Let me go!

TIMME (laughing)

Love dead! Hate living!

TIMMY

LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!

JUD (softly)

Sometimes dead is better, Louis.

GATE AGENT'S VOICE

This is the final call for United's

flight 61 to Chicago...

GATE AGENT (concludes)

All passengers should now be aboard.

LOUIS

You better get going, hon.

RACHEL

Oh Louis, I just don't know about

this--

LOUIS

I told you last night--this can be the

start of patching things up with your

folks. If something good doesn't come

of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

RACHEL

Louis, are you sure?

LOUIS

I'm sure.

ELLIE

I don't want to go to Chicago,

Gramma Dory.

DORY

Why not, darling?

ELLIE

I had a bad dream last night. A

nightmare.

IRWIN (kindly)

About what?

ELLIE

About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage.

ELLIE

And someone named Paxcow.

LOUIS

Come on, you guys--before you miss

the boat.

IRWIN

Louis, I am sorry. What can I say?

That I lost my mind? It's the truth,

but no good excuse.

LOUIS (hugs him back)

We all lost our minds, Irwin.

LOUIS

Be good to your mother, darlin'.

She needs you.

ELLIE

Come with us, daddy. Please come

with us!

LOUIS

I'll be there in three days--four

at the most. I've got to get the

electricity shut off and square

things with your school so the

truant officer ain't after you, and--

ELLIE (crying)

Please, daddy! I'm scared!

LOUIS

Of what?

ELLIE (crying harder)

I don't know.

LOUIS (great emphasis)

Everything's going to be all right,

Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.

ELLIE

Do you swear?

LOUIS

I swear.

CLERK

Anything else for you today?

LOUIS (after a look)

I think we got it all.

CLERK

Looks like heavy work.

LOUIS

It could be.

ELLIE

Paxcow says it's almost too late!

RACHEL

Ellie...Ellie...what...

ELLIE

Paxcow says it's almost too late!

We have to go back! Paxcow says it's

almost too late!

LOUIS

It's wrong. (Pause) What happened

to you is wrong.

PASCOW (voice)

Remember, doc.

PASCOW

The barrier was not meant to be

crossed. The ground is sour.

LOUIS

I'll tell you where the ground

is sour--the ground in my heart

is sour. Let me tell you something

else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.

PASCOW

Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.

LOUIS

Don't talk like an asshole even if

you are just a bit of underdone

potato or a blot of mustard.

LOUIS (weeping)

He was my son! He wasn't even two

and he was run down in the fucking

road and he was almost in pieces,

and if you don't think I'm going

to try...

LOUIS

If it doesn't work--if he comes

back like Timmy Baterman--I'll

put him to sleep. But I'm going

to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't

work...they don't ever need to know.

RACHEL (voice)

Honey, you just had a bad dream. You

know that, don't you?

ELLIE (voice)

It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

ELLIE

Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something

really bad. He--

RACHEL

Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the

boogeyman?

ELLIE

He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

RACHEL

There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you

to go to sleep and forget all this

nonsense.

ELLIE

Will you at least call and make sure

daddy's okay?

RACHEL

Of course I will.

RACHEL

Now will you try to go to sleep?

ELLIE (turns over on her side)

Yes, Mom.

RACHEL (to herself)

Paxcow, why do I know that name?

PASCOW

Pascow.

RACHEL

Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?

RACHEL

He's not home.

DORY

Why, he probably went out for

a hamburger or a chicken dinner,

dear. You know how men are when

they're alone.

JUD (picks up)

Hello--you got Judson.

RACHEL

It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm

calling from Chicago.

JUD (surprised voice)

Chicago! Is Louis with you?

RACHEL

No...we're going to be here

awhile, and he wanted a few days

to wind up our affairs there.

I just wondered if he was with you.

JUD

No--but if he drops by, I'll tell

him to call you.

RACHEL

Jud, do you remember the name

of the student that died on Louis's

first day at work? The one that was

hit by a car?

JUD (voice)

I don't--

RACHEL

Was it Pascow?

JUD

Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis

come home before I go to bed, I'll

tell him to--

RACHEL

Don't bother. I'm coming home.

JUD (alarmed voice)

Rachel!

RACHEL

Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.

JUD

No! Rachel! Don't do that!

Rachel--!

DORY

Rachel...darling...you're upset...

a night's sleep...

RACHEL

I have to go. The connections are

tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in

forty minutes. Will you drive me,

daddy?

IRWIN

You know something's wrong, don't you?

You know. And Ellie does, too.

RACHEL

Yes.

IRWIN

I'll drive you.

ELLIE (voice)

Mommy?

ELLIE

Please hurry.

RACHEL

I will. Come and kiss me.

IRWIN

I'll come with you if you want,

honey.

RACHEL (shakes her head)

I've got three planes to catch and

I got the last seats on two of them.

It's like God saved them for me.

LOUIS (low)

Gonna bust you out, son.

PILOT (voice)

This is the Captain speaking.

I'm sorry about this delay, folks,

but we've got a real low ceiling

tonight and air traffic control's

playing it safe. Looks like it's

going to be about half an hour before

we get on a roll, so I'm turning off

the NO SMOKING sign.

JUD

You done it, you stupid old man...

now you got to undo it.

SEATMATE

Think you'll make your connection

in Boston?

RACHEL

I have to.

LOUIS

Oh, Gage--oh, honey.

LOUIS

It's going to be all right...I

swear it's going to be all right...

PILOT (voice)

Good evening again, ladies and

gentlemen...

PILOT (continues)

I'm delighted to tell you that we've

got a strong tail-wind tonight and

we expect to arrive at Boston's

Logan Airport almost on time.

RACHEL (softly)

Thank God.

COP

I ain't afraid of no ghost.

PASCOW

There's just time. If you run.

PASCOW

Don't do that, babe.

RACHEL

Make it come back!

FEMALE GATE AGENT

I can't--

RACHEL (screams)

COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!!

PASCOW

You're doing just fine.

LOUIS

Please God--let this work.

LOUIS

Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't

gonna look down.

HERTZ CLERK

I'm sorry...it's been very busy

tonight. I really don't have

anything.

PASCOW

What about the Aries K with the

scratch on the side?

CLERK

I do have an Aries K, but it came

in sort of beat up--there's a long

scrape up one side--

RACHEL

I'll take it.

LOUIS

See? Just imagination. Just--

LOUIS

Nothing...there.

LOUIS

It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I

think the Wendigo just passed

within sixty feet of me.

LOUIS

It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.

RACHEL

Now what?

PASCOW

It's trying to stop you. Do you

hear me? It's trying to stop you.

RACHEL

Is anyone there?

LOUIS

Come back to me, Gage. Come back

Thank you.

RACHEL

Can't you go any faster?

Come on, stop playing games!

JUD

Gage? (Pause) Are you the one

playing games?

JUD

Gage? Come on out.

JUD

I want to show you something.

JUD (to the cat)

How did you--?!

RACHEL

Thank you so much.

TRUCKER

I didn't get a ticket, so you're

welcome, lady.

(And, more seriously)

Whatever your problems are, I hope

they work out.

PASCOW

It's the end of the line for me,

too--I'm not allowed any further.

RACHEL (to the trucker)

I'm sure things will be fine.

PASCOW

I'm not.

GAGE (soft voice)

Mummy!

GAGE (soft voice)

Mummy!

GAGE (voice)

Mummy, I need you!

RACHEL

Who--

CHURCH

Miaow!

RACHEL

Church!

GAGE (voice)

Mummy, I need you!

RACHEL

Gage? Gage?

LOUIS

Jesus!

LOUIS

Gage--?

LOUIS

Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!

LOUIS

Gage!

LOUIS

Hello!

IRWIN (voice)

Hello, Louis--it's Irwin.

I just wanted to be sure Rachel

got back all right.

IRWIN (voice)

Louis...are you there?

LOUIS (slowly)

Yes--I'm here.

IRWIN (voice)

Did she get there all right?

LOUIS

Yes, she's fine.

IRWIN (voice)

Well, put her on at that end and

I'll put Ellie on at this one.

Ellie's very worried about her

mother. (Pause) She's almost

in hysterics.

LOUIS

She...Rachel's asleep.

IRWIN (an edge in his voice now)

Then I suggest you wake her up.

Ellie...I think she had a dream that

her mother was dead.

LOUIS

I'll call you right back.

IRWIN (voice)

Louis--!

LOUIS

Irwin, you'll just have to--

GAGE (voice)

I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come

over and play with me?

LOUIS (a bare whisper)

Gage?

GAGE (voice)

Mommy already came. We played, daddy.

First I played with Jud and then mommy

came and I played with mommy. We had

an awful good time. Now I want to play

with you.

LOUIS

What did you do? What did you--

LOUIS

What you buy is what you own, and

sooner or later what you own comes

home to you. Wasn't that what you

said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?

LOUIS

Hi, Church. Want some grub?

LOUIS

Don't mind me. Eat it while you can.

Eat all you want.

LOUIS

Eat all you can...all you want...

that's right...today's Thanksgiving

day for cats, but only if they came

back from the dead...

LOUIS

No, you don't!

LOUIS

Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.

LOUIS

Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause)

Gage?

LOUIS

Gage?

GAGE (voice)

Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide

and go seek!

LOUIS

All right, Gage...let's.

LOUIS

I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--

LOUIS

I'm going to set things back in

order. I...I know just what to do.

LOUIS

Gage?

GAGE (screeching)

Allee-allee-in-free! allee-allee-

in-free! Allee-allee-in-free!

GAGE

No fair! NO FAIR!

LOUIS

And what you own always comes home

to you.

RACHEL (voice)

Darling.
