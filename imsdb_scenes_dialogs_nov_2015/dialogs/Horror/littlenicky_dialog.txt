"LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill

PEEPER

(whispering)

Showtime!

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?

(takes bite of sandwich)

Well you'll feel better once you slip

off those work clothes and get into some

sweats.

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me

rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't

use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Looks like Victoria just told me her

secret.

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,

first brassiere sighting...

(stops writing)

I will pleasure myself to this image for

months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What

unfortunate timing.  You mother was just

getting comfy.

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great

knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Now what.  This simply won't do.

SCOTTIE

Hello?

PEEPER

Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go

downstairs like a good boy and let your

mother freshen up.

SCOTTIE

Who is this?

PEEPER

Just a little birdie.  A birdie who

wants to see if your mother's panties

match her bra.

MOTHER

Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up

our tree?

PEEPER

Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big

bird.

PEEPER (CONT'D)

Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And

wear your bikini.

HARD CUT:

GATEKEEPER (O.S.)

Welcome!

PEEPER

Am I in hell?

GATEKEEPER

What do you think?

NICKY

(embarrassed)

Hey...

JIMMY THE DEMON

Your father wants to see you and your

brothers in the throne room.

NICKY

Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is

rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

CASSIUS

I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

ADRIAN

I've been waiting on this day for ten

thousand years.

HUMAN DARTBOARD

Aaaah!

CASSIUS

If the old man picks me to take over

Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty

four seven.  No breaks.

ADRIAN

Well Dad says it's the breaks that make

the torture.  You have to let people

feel a sense of relief.

HUMAN DARTBOARD

Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

ADRIAN

Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring

is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

CASSIUS

I'll take that.

HUMAN DARTBOARD

Was that really necessary?

CASSIUS

Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing

today?

NICKY

Good, thanks.

CASSIUS

Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

NICKY

Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

CASSIUS

Got ya!

NICKY

(picking up his head)

Yes, you got me...

CASSIUS

Got ya, again!

NICKY

(picking head up)

Got me for sure, yes...

CASSIUS

Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

NICKY

Oh no.  Please Cassius...

NICKY (CONT'D)

Aaaaah.

DAD

What are you boys doing?

NICKY

Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the

furniture.

DAD

Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out

of your brother's mind?

CASSIUS

I forgot.

DAD

Maybe this will help you remember.

DAD (CONT'D)

Now everybody sit down.

NICKY

Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying

down my monsters of metal compilation

tape.  I really think it's a

masterpiece.

DAD

Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

DAD (CONT'D)

My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was

thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules

here in hell for ten thousand years.

And after this ten thousand years had

passed, he decided to abdicate his

throne...

DAD (CONT'D)

...to step aside.

(Nicky lowers his hand)

...and let me become the ruler of hell.

This, as some of you might know, is my

ten thousandth year as Prince of

Darkness.  So I think the time has come

to discuss who will succeed me.

JIMMY THE DEMON

Knock, knock.

DAD

Yes, Jimmy.

DAD (CONT'D)

No, no, that's not what I said.  He can

keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta

go.

JIMMY THE DEMON

(turning to leave)

Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a

pineapple up Hitler's ass at four

o'clock.

DAD

This was a very difficult decision,

because I have three wonderful sons.  I

mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.

And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And

Nicky, so...so...

NICKY

Don't worry about coming up with

anything.  It's cool.

DAD

Such a sweet boy.  But after much

thought and careful consideration, I've

decided that the ruler for the next ten

thousand years is going to have to

be...me.

CASSIUS AND ADRIAN

(dumbfounded)

What!?

NICKY

Hallelujah.

NICKY (CONT'D)

I mean...tough break.

DAD

The important thing for the stability of

our rule is to maintain the balance

between good and evil.  And I don't

think any of you are ready for that

responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom

that comes only with the passage of

time.

CASSIUS

Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

DAD

Right.  Right.  Send him in.

(to the boys)

I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back

to work.

ADRIAN

You sure about this decision, Dad?

DAD

I'm telling you, pal, it's the right

thing to do.

HITLER

Holy schnit!!

CASSIUS

You work your ass off for ten thousand

years, hurting people, helping others

hurt people, then you get a decision

like that.

ADRIAN

And he's dead serious.

CASSIUS

It's just such a slap in the face.

ADRIAN

Um, excuse me, we're having a private

conversation here.

CASSIUS

Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

ADRIAN

Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa

Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in

hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm

getting tired of serving in Hell.  We

need a place where we can rule.

CASSIUS

Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it

on!! Let's see what you got!

CASSIUS (CONT'D)

That's what I thought!

ADRIAN

(to Cassius)

Could you concentrate for five seconds?

CASSIUS

I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

ADRIAN

What do you think about...Earth?

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

We could create our own hell there.

CASSIUS

You saying we go up there and kill

everyone?

ADRIAN

Eventually, Cassius.  But first we

corrupt as many as we can so that when

we do destroy them...

CASSIUS

...their damned souls will be ours.

ADRIAN

It's our time, brother.

GATEKEEPER

Hey, what are you doing?!?

GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)

You can't go through there.  The fire

flows in, not out.

GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)

You know something?  You guys suck!  You

really suck!

DAD

Now that was an experience.  "You are

only coming through in waves."  That

line blows my mind every time.

NICKY

Definitely.

DAD

I don't care what kind of mood you're in

at the start of that song.  When it's

over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.

Great shit.  What's next?

NICKY

Well, I thought that after messing with

your head, I'd give you a little kick in

the keester.

DAD

Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

NICKY

Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

DAD

I was just playing with you.

DAD

I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,

I regretfully have to decline.

DAN

C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one

Superbowl ring.

DAD

In exchange for eternal damnation of

your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for

me to want to do that to you, Mr.

Marino.

DAN

You did it for Namath.

DAD

Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.

Just go back to Earth and enjoy your

records and the Hall of Fame and the

beautiful family and all that.

DAN

This is bullshit, man.

(gets up to leave)

I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,

with or without you!

DAD

Now you're talking.

NICKY

You're a good devil, Dad.

DAD

And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

GATEKEEPER

Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have

escaped from hell.  They went through

the fire, and they broke it.  I think

they took the New York tunnel.  I tried

to stop them, but they overpowered me,

sir.

DAD

Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off

your knees.

GATEKEEPER

Thanks for being so understanding, your

worship.  You're the man.  You've always

been the man.

GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)

(to Nicky)

I'm lucky to get away with just the head

boobs, right?

NICKY

Coulda been much worse.

GATEKEEPER

That's what I'm thinkin'...

DAD

This is bad, Nicky.

NICKY

How bad?

DAD

I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are

broken, no new souls can get in, which

means I'll start to deteriorate into

nothing.

LUCIFER

What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

DAD

Everything's fine, pop.

LUCIFER

Last time you said that the renaissance

happened.

DAD

Please, pop, just go back to your room.

LUCIFER

(regarding gateskeeper)

Can I take him with me and have sex with

his head?

DAD

Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

GATEKEEPER

Oh, this is gonna be a whole new

lifestyle for me, isn't it.

DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)

What's going on?  Where are we?

JIMMY THE DEMON

Nothing's getting through that.  The

fire is solid as a rock.

NICKY

We gotta get this bad boy burning again.

Ideas?

DAD

To do that Cassius and Adrian have to

come back through the other way.

NICKY

So go get 'em, Dad!

DAD

I'm too weak.  The process has already

begun.

NICKY

So go get 'em, Jimmy!

JIMMY THE DEMON

I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got

devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes

up there with your brothers.

NICKY

You're not saying it's up to me?

NICKY (CONT'D)

I've never been to Earth.  I've never

even slept over at some other dude's

house!

JIMMY THE DEMON

You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it

in you.

DAD

Nicky, the worst thing that could happen

on Earth is you get killed, in which

case, boom, you end up back here.

NICKY

Are you telling me I have to go to Earth

and kill my brothers?

JIMMY THE DEMON

Not go.  They left together at the exact

same time.  They gotta come back

together at the exact same time.

DAD

Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One

sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once

you've got both of them, you bring the

flask back through the gate.

JIMMY THE DEMON

Your ol' man's got less than a week.

NICKY

No.  This can't be happening.

DAD

Son, just do your best.

NICKY

Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This

doesn't look too bad.

EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

JIMMY THE DEMON

You were gone ten seconds.  What

happened?

NICKY

I got hit by a big light that was

attached to a lot of metal.

DAD

That's a train, son.  Don't stand in

front of them.

NICKY

Well, I guess I'm going to have to take

a mulligan on this one.

DAD

Please, Nicky, get back up there.

(his ear falls off)

Try to hurry.

NICKY

I'm Nicky.

BEEFY

(voice of Sandy Wernick)

Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track

and come with me, shitstains.

BEEFY

My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of

your father's.  He's asked me to help

you out.

NICKY

I just need to find my brothers and be

on my way, Beefy.

BEEFY

It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers

can possess people.  So they probably

won't look like themselves.  You have to

be suspicious of everyone.

NICKY

Okay, "bro," this jig is up...

(pulling out the flask)

Just get in the bottle.  Just slide

right on in there.

BEEFY

It's not me, moron.

NICKY

Oh.  Sorry.

PREACHER

Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his

children.

(passerby puts in money)

He thanks you for your kindness.

(another woman puts in money)

God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...

The Lord loves you...

PREACHER (CONT'D)

The Lord does not love you.  I

sense...pure evil.

(thrusts his cross in Nicky's

face)

You make the Lord very nervous.

(feeling hot)

I'm burning...ahhh.

(running away)

The Devil walks among us!

PREACHER (CONT'D)

Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

BEEFY

Makin' friends already.

NICKY

(shivering a little)

It's freezing up here, Beefy.

BEEFY

You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have

the same physical needs and limitations

a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get

you some warm clothes.

NICKY

I also have this odd pain in my mid

section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

BEEFY

That pain is hunger.

NICKY

So far, so good.  Now what?

BEEFY

Put it in your mouth.

BEEFY (CONT'D)

Move your teeth up and down.

BEEFY (CONT'D)

Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your

head back and let the meat slide down

your throat-hole.

NICKY

Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

BEEFY

It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're

gonna need your energy.

NICKY

I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's

get cracking!

GATEKEEPER

Hey.

NICKY

That's a pretty brassiere.

GATEKEEPER

Thanks.

NICKY

Could you maybe not tell anyone about

this?

GATEKEEPER

You got it.  Could you maybe not tell

anyone about this?

NICKY

You got it.

NICKY

From now on.  I'm just going to avoid

all moving metal objects.

BEEFY

Great.  Now your father gave me some

deposit money for a nice pad on the

Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

BEEFY

So I found this other joint for you.

But you're gonna have a roommate.

TODD

(on phone)

I know exactly how you feel... The night

Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,

"Is this man going to blow up the world,

Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an

hour.

(knock at the door)

Somebody's here.  Call you later.

NICKY

Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I

understand you're seeking a roommate, as

per your advertisement in the Village

Voice.  Would it be possible for me to

fill the slot?

TODD

Uh, don't you want to know what the rent

is?

NICKY

Yes.  What is rent?

TODD

Eight-hundred, split down the middle.

Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with

my scene partner so the living room will

be off limits.

NICKY

Off limits.

TODD

Right.  And as far as household items:

we can share the soap, but we'll split

the cost 60/40.

Cause the person who physically goes out

and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay

as much as the other guy.

(looks at Nicky)

Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

NICKY

No.

TODD

It's like eighty degrees in this

hallway.  You from the South?

NICKY

Yeah.  The deep South.

TODD

Why is that funny?

NICKY

I don't know.

TODD

And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

BEEFY

You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day

tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep

thing I told you about.

NICKY

Got ya.

(to Todd)

Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

TODD

Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

CARDINAL

In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who

we are to live if we wish to attain the

splendor of Heaven... or something like

that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in

the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.

Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

CARDINAL (CONT'D)

Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of

hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really

done anything for us?  Has he ever put a

Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever

given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.

He hasn't done a damn thing for any of

us.

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

The Lord gave my son the strength to get

off drugs.

CARDINAL

Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,

he was better off on drugs.  He's a

bore.  At least when he was smoking

hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

YOUNG MAN

After we tried for many years, the Lord

finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

CARDINAL

No, your best friend Fitzie helped your

wife conceive a baby.  He helped her

conceive it all night long.

CARDINAL (CONT'D)

How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever

do anything for you?

MAYOR

(standing)

Well, I wish I could think of something,

Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I

can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if

there even is a Lord.  If there is any

ultimate punishment for our so-called

"sins."  Maybe we should all just have

fun and do whatever the hell we want.

CARDINAL

Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Oh, this is delicious.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

(laughing)

"Let the sin begins" - that was a good

one.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Well, we must get people sinning if we

want to fill up our New Hell.  How are

things going down at City Hall?

CASSIUS (O.S.)

I lowered the drinking age to ten.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I

never want it to end.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

NICKY

This is intense!  And it happens every

day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my

hat to you people!

BEEFY

Look, it's okay for me to shit the

street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

NICKY

(pulling up pants)

Okay, just point me in the right

direction next time.

BEEFY

Come on, there's like ten million people

in this city and the clock is ticking.

NICKY

Well, let's rock and roll.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.

You froze the gate and you're killing

him.  Drink!

CHINESE DELIVERY GUY

I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

NICKY

just get in the flask!

NICKY (CONT'D)

Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to

the head is gonna make me throw in the

towel?  Well, in the immortal words of

Judas Priest, "You got another thing

comin'."

GATEKEEPER

Bus?

NICKY

Beast.

GATEKEEPER

(to Monster)

You like that?  You think that's funny?

GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)

How about that?  You like that?

NICKY

All that running and chasing is making

the sleep thing want to come early.

BEEFY

I think we have to work on narrowing

down our list of suspects.  Now I'm

going to go check in with some of my

contacts uptown.

BEEFY (CONT'D)

Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just

begging to come out...

PETER

Sounds like our devil dance actually

worked this time.

JOHN

'Bout time...

JOHN (CONT'D)

There's our man.

PETER

Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties

to the dark side.

JOHN

What's with that guy?

PETER

Gotta be one of his disciples or

something.

JOHN

Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got

ripped off.

PETER

Should we wake him up?

JOHN

Yeah.  You do it.

PETER

Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude

just stole your shit.

NICKY

Oh nooooo....

NICKY (CONT'D)

Which way did he go?

JOHN

That way.

NICKY

Iron Maiden live double disc is simply

phenomenal.

PETER

Did you check out the dragon mouth?

JOHN

The Dark Prince is here.

NICKY

Hey...

STREET VENDOR

See something you like, my man?

NICKY

Yes.  I would like my flask back.

STREET VENDOR

You callin' me a thief, my man?

NICKY

No, I'm just calling you... a guy who

has my flask.

STREET VENDOR

And if that is your so-called "flask,"

how would I have it unless I was, in

fact, a thief?

NICKY

(not sure what the answer is)

I don't know?

MAN

Yeah, how much for the silver flask

there?

STREET VENDOR

Well, that's a very special item.  The

cap itself is one hundred percent

plappium.  It's a value is over three

thousand dollars.

MAN

Really.  Where's it from?

NICKY

It was handcrafted in hell by Satan

himself and is only to be used for the

capture and containment of my blood

brothers so that the firefall of Hades

will burn brightly once again.

MAN

Really.  I think we'll let you keep it

then.

STREET VENDOR

Okay, now you gone and done it.  You

done messed with my business bitch!

NICKY

Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise

your voice.  It's making my muscles

tighten.

STREET VENDOR

Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?

I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's

get busy.

VALERIE

Excuse me, does that flask belong to

this man?

STREET VENDOR

(frustrated)

Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

VALERIE

Look, I know you come out here and sell

stolen stuff all the time.  But today,

the guy you stole from just happened to

walk by and bust you.  So why don't you

admit today's not your day and give him

his flask back?

STREET VENDOR

Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly

me to death?

VALERIE

No, but maybe that cop over there might

have something to say.

STREET VENDOR

Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.

(looking at Valerie)

And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes

and find a new corner.  Before I show

you what real crazy is.

VALERIE

Fine.  I will.

NICKY

Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a

few years.

NICKY (CONT'D)

That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You

didn't have to do that.

VALERIE

That's okay.  I get messed with all the

time and when I saw him doing that to

you I just lost it.  I hate when people

take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it

for the rest of us.

NICKY

You think I'm a tourist?

VALERIE

I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent

maybe.  Where are you from?

NICKY

The South.

VALERIE

Really?

NICKY

Yeah.  Deep south.

(laughs hard)

VALERIE

Why are you laughing?

NICKY

I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your

glasses are nice.  They make your eyes

look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look

at them.

VALERIE

My dad's an optometrist.

NICKY

My dad's in hell, and he's falling

apart.

VALERIE

I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your

parents get older.

NICKY

If I don't save him, I don't know what

I'm gonna do.

VALERIE

Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like

you will figure something out.

NICKY

Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick

ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

VALERIE

That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I

actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

NICKY

Could I come with you to getting a

Gelati?

VALERIE

If you want to.

NICKY

Want to?  A million angry octopus people

couldn't hold me back!

VALERIE

"Octopus people?"

NICKY

Uh, it's a deep south expression.

NICKY

It's freezing my hands.

VALERIE

It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap

it.

PREACHER

Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!

Your evil is stinking up our streets!

We're all gonna die!

VALERIE

This town is really going to hell

lately.

(Nicky nods)

So what part of the city do you live in?

NICKY

I have an apartment.  I don't remember

exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

VALERIE

(laughs)

You have a dog?  What kind?

NICKY

I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's

uptown talking to his contacts.

BEEFY

Remember, it's not the size of the boat,

it's the motion of the ocean.

GIRL DOG

Just finish.

VALERIE

I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to

school full time.  It wouldn't be fair

to the dog.

NICKY

School?

VALERIE

Parsons School of Design.  I knew

growing up I wasn't much to look at, so

I put my energy into making things that

are pretty.

NICKY

What's that pleasant smell coming from,

your skin?

VALERIE

My perfume?

VALERIE (CONT'D)

(laughs)

It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."

Which I think is the French word for

coconuts.

NICKY

Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch

of butterflies flapping around in my

stomach.  Is that normal?

VALERIE

Sometimes, sure.

NICKY

Good.  I was concerned.

GATEKEEPER

Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I

hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

LUCIFER

You know, I was the one who created

Hell.

GATEKEEPER

I know, your wickedness.

LUCIFER

I started slow, though.  For years, I

was just giving people hot foots.

Actually, you can give all the credit

for Hell to my first wife; she was the

inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.

One day, she asked me if I wanted super

sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

LUCIFER (CONT'D)

Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,

you look like her mother, except she had

more hair.

LUCIFER (CONT'D)

You know what was in Hell when I came

down here, Cassius?

GATEKEEPER

It's Stanley, sir.

LUCIFER

Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.

Looked like a giant parking lot.  It

wasn't even called Hell.

GATEKEEPER

What was it called, sir.

LUCIFER

Boogerland!

GATEKEEPER

That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you

just enjoy the fishing?

LUCIFER

I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.

I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I

catch everything...

PEEPER

I deserve this!

KID

I just stole twenty-five bucks off the

bar.

KID #2

How many beers did you have?

KID # 3

Eight sips.

KID

I had five!  I'm so wasted.

ADRIAN

When an adult goes to Hell, that's

terrific.  But when a child goes...

that's why I'm in this business.

NICKY

So you're saying, make all pants with a

drawstring, then heavier set gals don't

have to feel humiliated by telling their

waist size in front of the whole store?

VALERIE

Basically, yeah.

NICKY

Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring

socks for gals with fat ankles.

VALERIE

You know what's nice about you?  You

just seem happy being yourself.  You

don't try to act cool.

NICKY

Thanks much.  You know what's nice about

you, Valerie?

VALERIE

What?

NICKY

Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

VALERIE

What was that?

NICKY

(shocked and confused)

I...I don't know why I just said that.

I meant to say that...

QUICK CUT TO:

NICKY (CONT'D)

...I've always wanted to have sex with a

gross pig.  What do you say we go behind

that dumpster, pull our pants down and

see what happens?

VALERIE

You're a jerk.

NICKY (O.S.)

ADRIAN!

ADRIAN (O.S.)

You shouldn't have come here.

NICKY (O.S.)

Please, get out of my mind!

NICKY (CONT'D)

Hey, Valerie!

VALERIE

What the hell's your problem?

NICKY (O.S.)

Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.

Dad's sick.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

He's sick?

NICKY (O.S.)

Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you

guys left, you broke the gates.  We

gotta get the gates burning again before

he dies.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

He should have thought of that before he

denied me my birthright.

NICKY (O.S.)

Well maybe you should go back and talk

it over with him.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

How about this?  I stay here enjoying my

Schnapps and you go back.

NICKY (O.S.)

Adrian, please...

PETER

Check this out.  The number of the

beast.

DAN RATHER

Reverberations from Arch-Decon

Donnelly's shocking speech are still

being felt throughout the city.  Today,

some disgruntled cast members of the

play CATS broke the fourth wall in a

most hostile manner.

DAN RATHER

...But even that does not come close to

what happened today on Live with Regis

and Kathy Lee.

REGIS

So I was driving to work today, and some

bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...

KATHY LEE

Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

REGIS

So I followed him...

KATHY LEE

You followed him?

REGIS

I followed him all the way downtown, and

when he gets out of the car, I reach

under my seat and pull out an aluminum

bat.

KATHY LEE

You keep a bat under your seat?

REGIS

Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this

guy, and start bashing his brains in

with this bat, and it made me feel

happy!  Did you ever see THE

UNTOUCHABLES?

KATHY LEE

Yes, great movie...

REGIS

I was DeNiro!

BEEFY

Your brothers are upsetting the balance

of good and evil.

NICKY

What can I do about it?

BEEFY

You can't do jack shit... unless you

learn your evil powers.

NICKY

Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those

dudes put the wick in wicked.

BEEFY

Go get a soda out of the fridge.

NICKY

But those are my roommate's sodas...

BEEFY

(high-pitched mocking)

"But those are my roommate's sodas..."

Does that sound like a statement the son

of the devil would make?

BEEFY (CONT'D)

You have the power to change the cola in

that can into any other liquid - engine

oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just

have to release the evil within you.

NICKY

Release the evil?

BEEFY

I'm just saying, there's wickedness in

you... I can tell from your snores.

BEEFY (CONT'D)

Release your evil...

TODD

What are you doing?

TODD (CONT'D)

I know it's your living room night.  But

can I finish watching the Globetrotters'

game out here?  To me it's classic

Comedia Dellarte.

CUT TO:

BILL WALTON

What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse

85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal

run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,

seem to be struggling to find their

groove in front of their hometown fans.

REF

He's walking, get him a bus!

BILL WALTON

Oh, another awful call.  There is no way

that was travelling.

CORNROWS

What's with all these crazy calls?  You

gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a

game in 53 years.

REF

Technical foul!

NICKY

That guy in the striped shirt snaps his

fingers like someone I know...

NICKY (CONT'D)

It looks like the work of a brother...

TODD

A black guy?

NICKY

If it's Cassius, yes.

GLOBETROTTER FAN

Get your head out your ass, ref!  The

kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

REF

Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?

Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth

in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten

points off for the Globetrotters.

BILL WALTON

In all my years of basketball, I was

never so happy to hear a halftime

buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second

half doesn't get any better, I expect a

full scale riot.

COURT ANNOUNCER

It's time for the Globetrotter's

halftime half-court heave throw, where

one lucky fan will have a shot at ten

thousand dollars!

COURT ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

And if he makes it, everyone in

attendance today will receive a free

pizza.

MIGUEL

I ain't goin' out there and taking the

shot.  These people have gone crazy.

NICKY

I'll take the shot.

PETER

Look who's back from the dead.

JOHN

Six, six, six, pick up sticks.

TODD

What's Nicky doing down there?

BEEFY

Trying to capture his brother in a flask

and preserve the balance of good and

evil on Earth.

TODD

Did you just talk?

BEEFY

No.

COURT ANNOUNCER

You better win these people some free

pizza.  Looks like they're about to

start killing each other.

NICKY

Release the evil.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Okay, too much evil..

BILL WALTON

I think that ball just blew up.  And

yes, my hair is aflame.

NICKY

(turning to sideline)

Could I get another ball?

NICKY (CONT'D)

I command you not to blow up and go into

that metal circle.

REF

Get that crap outta here!

NICKY (O.S.)

I know you're having fun, Cassius, but

you gotta come back to Hell.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

Look around you, Nicky.  We're in Hell.

The New Hell.

NICKY

Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in

great danger...

NICKY (CONT'D)

Alright, how about this?  I get one more

shot.  The ref will cover me.  I miss

it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game.

I make it, he doesn't ref the second

half and we all start conducting

ourselves like decent human beings

again.

NICKY (CONT'D)

And we get free pizza.

BILL WALTON

I think it's safe to say we're all

rooting for this bizarre and hideous

looking man.

CROWD

Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky!

NICKY

You know, Dad got very sick when you

left.

REF

I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my

turn now.

BEEFY

Take him to the hole, Nicky.

(Todd stares)

I mean, woof!  Woof!

NICKY

Never doubt my skills.

CORNROWS

Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.

REF

That's nuts.  When'd you learn that

shit?

NICKY

Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super

devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I

might need it for just such an occasion.

REGIS

Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's

go best two out of three.

NICKY

(pulls out the flask)

No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for

me.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

Damn you, Nicky!  There ain't no super

devil juice in here!

TODD

So your father's the devil, you're a

talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys

are who?

PEEPER

Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and

the work his Dad does.

JOHN

By the way, Nicky.  Check this out.

JOHN (CONT'D)

What's Ozzy trying to say there?

NICKY

Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always

came straight with his messages.  But

wrap your minds around this one.

VOICE

I command you in the name of the Lucifer

to spread the blood of the innocent.

JOHN

No wonder your uncle's so weird...

TODD

I gotta say this cake tastes a little

funny.

PETER

Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the

mix.  Tried to spice up the bash.

NICKY

What's reefer?

DISSOLVE TO:

JOHN

Come on.  One more time.

NICKY

Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts.

PETER

Please.  You got to.

NICKY

(resigned)

All right...

BEEFY

I used to get baked like this with my

first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so

stoned she would forget I was a dog.

JOHN

She was human?

BEEFY

Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,

that pissed my parents off.

JOHN

I dated a Japanese girl once.  My

parents disapproved.  Not cause she's

Japanese, but cause she was only

fifteen.

NICKY

I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.

TODD

I was in love one time but she said I

wasn't financially reliable enough.  And

she needed that.

JOHN

By she, do you mean he?

TODD

No.

BEEFY

Busted.

(laughs)

PETER

How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul

Jabar?

NICKY

A little strange.  I can't stop thinking

about this girl, Valerie.

TODD

Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss

her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?

JOHN

Easy, Liberace.

TODD

Oh, would you grow up.

NICKY

We had the greatest afternoon of my life

until Adrian made me tell her she had a

heart-shaped ass.

BEEFY

Maybe you love her.  But what do I know?

I'm baked out of my mind.

PETER

Me, too.  We're gonna get going.

TODD

You guys want to stay?  I have a futon

in my bedroom.

JOHN

That's a big pass, Elton John.

PETER

We're going to see Ozzy play at the

Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come,

Nicky?

NICKY

No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be

able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

JOHN

Whoa, that chick must be the real deal,

then.  Later on.

NICKY

See ya, fellas.

BEEFY (O.S.)

You better snap out of it soon, kid.

Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow.

Seven AM.  Nighty, night.

TODD

That is the most frightening thing I

have ever seen.

NICKY

Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School

of Design?

NICKY

(he sniffs)

Coconuts...

STUDENT

Hello.

NICKY

You smell like coconuts.

STUDENT

It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me

feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda

what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?

NICKY

No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named

Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

STUDENT

Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one

window over.

NICKY

Thanks, much.  Good luck with the

genital tucking.

STUDENT

I don't need luck.  I'm good.

NICKY

Adrian?

STUDENT

Andrew.

NICKY

Hey.

VALERIE

Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

NICKY

Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

VALERIE

What were you thinking coming here?

NICKY

I'm not sure, but it didn't involve

getting blinded with poison.

VALERIE

Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

VALERIE (CONT'D)

Nicky?

NICKY

Valerie?

VALERIE

Are you dead?

NICKY

No.

VALERIE

What are you doing?

NICKY

I think I'm floating.

VALERIE

Why would you be floating?

NICKY

I don't know.  Maybe it's because of

your sweet voice.

VALERIE

Am I supposed to not be freaked out

right now?  Because I am.

NICKY

I can't see you but I can smell you.

And you make me feel alive in a way I've

never felt before.

STUDENT

You got the wrong window again, man.

NICKY

Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

VALERIE

I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

VALERIE (CONT'D)

Look, just because you're floating

doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you

giving me the finger.

NICKY

That wasn't me.  I was being possessed

by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who

call you a gross pig.

VALERIE

What do you mean, "possessed?"

NICKY

Remember when I told you my Dad was in

Hell?

VALERIE

Yes...

NICKY

Well, that's because he's the Devil.

And he wants to keep his throne for

another ten-thousand years.  Which is

fine with me, but not with my brothers,

so they broke out of Hell, causing my

dad...

VALERIE

... "The Devil?"...

NICKY

...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad

very much.  So I came to Earth to save

him but then crazy eyes stole my flask

and I met you and...well, my dog tells

me I just might be in love with you.

VALERIE

Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

VALERIE (CONT'D)

I don't know if I should believe you.

NICKY

You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe

in the butterflies.

VALERIE

Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

VALERIE

This is amazing.

PREACHER

The hellbeast is above us.  He's

invading our skies!  We're all gonna

die!  We're all gonna die!

VALERIE

He's kind of ruining the mood.

NICKY

Let me take care of that.

PREACHER

We're all gonna die!

VALERIE

Can we go fly over Central Park?

NICKY

Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the

most beautiful thing I could possibly

imagine.

VALERIE

We're going to Jersey?

NICKY

East Rutherford.

NICKY

I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live

until he was dead.

(he looks at her)

Please tell me you like metal.

VALERIE

(sings along to song)

"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your

head..."

NICKY

My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICKY

(in Korean)

Moo ya san jie bay!

NICKY

What's going on here?

NICKY

Ow...what was that for?

BUM

Fifty million dollars.

NICKY

Release the evil.

NICKY

I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

BEEFY

The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a

look.

TODD

Been breaking all morning.

DAN RATHER

At a news conference earlier today,

Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this

beleaguered city its latest dose of bad

news.  He revealed that the man who

caused a sensation at basketball arena

last night is no hero... he is, in fact,

a mass murderer.

NICKY

I didn't murder anybody

BEEFY

Look.  You were really high.  Things

happen.

NICKY

I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is

Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

BEEFY

I think you're looking at him.

CHIEF OF POLICE

(on TV)

This video shows what he did after he

left the basketball arena yesterday...

GUY

(Adrian's voice)

My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all

you suckers for no reason!

CHIEF OF POLICE

Difficult to watch, I know.  In response

to this vicious crime, I am authorizing

the largest reward in law enforcement

history: fifty million dollars to the

person or persons who bring this man to

me.

NICKY

This is baloney!

BEEFY

He superimposed your head onto

"Scarface."

TODD

...which is by far DePalma's best

work...

NICKY

I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't

live here!

PETER

Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

JOHN

There's like a total mob scene coming

this way.

NICKY

I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

TODD

Looks like they're following a giant

trail of bug shit.

PETER

What'll we do now, Beefy?

BEEFY

I don't know, this is a little out of my

league.

VOICES (O.S.)

Come on.  Let's get 'em.

JOHN

What would your dad do, Nicky?

NICKY

Good idea...kill me.

PETER

Dude.  Seriously?

NICKY

Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at

noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

JOHN AND PETER

(psyched)

Alright!

NICKY

That just hurt a lot.

TODD

I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can

I do it?

JOHN

Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

TODD

Die, Grandma, die!

LUCIFER

Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the

bra.

LUCIFER (CONT'D)

Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,

two hillbillies were blowing on them.

NICKY

Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after

me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am

I gonna do?

DAD

What are you gonna do?  Look at me,

Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I

got one ear...

DAD (CONT'D)

I got no ears!  I can't hear!

JIMMY THE DEMON

Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?

Your father's got no ears!

NICKY

Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have

any advice at all for me?

DAD

I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear

anything!

JIMMY THE DEMON

Check one-two.  Check one-two.

DAD

Put it back on my head.  I'm falling

apart here.

JIMMY THE DEMON

He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.

(putting ear back on Dad)

You get your ass back up there.  You

save your father!

PETER

You sure you're down with this?

JOHN

Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Looking for the chief.

PETER

We know where to find Nicky.

CHIEF OF POLICE

You have what I want?

JOHN

Sure do.  You got what we want?

PETER

Fifty million bones, bro.

CHIEF OF POLICE

That's half of it.  You get the rest

when I get Nicky.

PETER

Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.

He's not human.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Really?

JOHN

We think he's the son of Satan.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra

careful.  Now where is he?

BAG LADY

Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you

are?

CHIEF OF POLICE

(never stopping)

Emperor of the New Hell.

TODD

Where is he?  He's late.

BEEFY

He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,

kid.

BEEFY (CONT'D)

We've been ratted out.

TODD

You guys.  That was so uncool.

PETER

We thought the son of Satan would

understand a move like this.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Okay, take these two outside.  I can

handle this.

CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)

Wanna see something cool?

ADRIAN

Ta-da.  So what time is my brother

expected back?

JOHN

Noon...

JOHN (CONT'D)

...ish.

PETER

So even though you're not really the

chief, we still get the rest of the

cash, right bro?

ADRIAN

You know what you'll get?  An

indescribably horrific torture

administered by demons for the rest of

eternity.

JOHN

But what about the cash?  Can we keep it

or what?

ADRIAN

Sure, why not?

LADY

(mumbling to herself)

Food stamps?

They should call 'em "dude stamps."

Cause ever time I get one, some dude

takes it away...

LADY (CONT'D)

Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with

me for a dollar!

JOHN

No thanks...but we'll take that bottle

of booze.

(grabs the bottle, laughs)

LADY

Hey...that's mine.

PETER

Beat it, ya freak.

JOHN

Schnapps...

PETER

(takes the bag, swigs)

Peppermint...alright.

JOHN

Wanna hit?

PETER

Drink up.  Here's to fifty million

clams.

ADRIAN

To the defilement of Earth and the

corruption of its people.

PETER

Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and

let's get outta this hell-hole.

ADRIAN

It is awfully hot down here.  How do you

manage to stay so cool?

JOHN

Weed lowers the body temperature.

(stuttering)

I read that...in, uh...er, science

magazine.

ADRIAN

This liquid will probably quench my

thirst.  Cool me off.

PETER

Definitely.

JOHN

And give you a good buzz.

ADRIAN

Or maybe it will trap me inside for all

eternity.

JOHN

Uh.  No it won't?

ADRIAN

Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out

and say hello...

JOHN

Urr...uggg...errr...

ADRIAN

(eyes getting red)

I'm calling you out, brother...

JOHN/NICKY

Urrr...uggh...

(as Nicky)

Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

ADRIAN

Hello, Cassius.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

All right.  Let me out.

ADRIAN

You know, New Hell really only needs one

new Satan.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

You mother...

ADRIAN

But Cassius could use some company for

the rest of eternity.  So get in the

flask.

COP

Oh, he's gotta pee.

TODD

Run, Beefy!  Run!

NICKY

I won't drink.  You can't make me.

ADRIAN

Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.

(Nicky is scared)

Unlike you, she won't come back from

where she's going.

NICKY

Let her go.

ADRIAN

I hear a train coming.  Drink.

VALERIE

Don't do it.

NICKY

I have to, Valerie.

ADRIAN

Ahhh!

BEEFY

Now that hurt the both of us.

NICKY

Valerie!!!

ADRIAN

See you in Hell!

DISSOLVE TO:

ANGEL

Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're

here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I

am so excited right now.

CHRISTA

So excited.

JENNA

She really is.

NICKY

That's terrific.  Now could you ladies

point me to the Black Palace?  I should

check in with my dad...

ANGEL

I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

JENNA

Do you have any idea where you are right

now?

NICKY

The home of eternal damnation, house of

Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

ANGEL

Maybe try the opposite of that.

ANGEL (CONT'D)

Okay, can I just ask you something?

What do you know about your mom?

NICKY

My brothers told me my mother was a

mountain goat.  Which would explain my

chronic halitosis.

ANGEL

(annoyed)

A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

NICKY

My mom wasn't a goat?

ANGEL

Try an angel.

NICKY

An angel?

ANGEL

Unh-huh.  Which would make you half

angel.

NICKY

Wow.  What...what did she look like?

ANGEL

Well, she was about six-three, only

spoke Portuguese and had really long

grey hair.

ANGEL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.

I'm your mom.

JENNA

I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest

look on your face.

CHRISTA

You're gonna be so happy she did that.

NICKY

(stunned)

How come you're not older?

ANGEL

Angels don't get any older, son.

JENNA

I can't believe you just called him

"son."

ANGEL

Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

DAD

I can't see shit.  You're all still

here, right?

JIMMY THE DEMON

Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal

in a jiffy, sir.

DAD LIPS

Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came

through.

ADRIAN

Where's Nicky?

JIMMY THE DEMON

He came with you and Cassius, right?

ADRIAN

I came through that gate alone.

JIMMY THE DEMON

Sorry, sir, false alarm.

DAD

Boooo.

ADRIAN

Somebody explain what's going on.

GATEKEEPER

You'll get nothing out of me.

ADRIAN

Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your

lips.

GATEKEEPER

The only way to save your dad is for you

and your brothers to pass through the

gates at the same time before he

deteriorates completely.

ADRIAN

How much time does Dad have before that

happens?

GATEKEEPER

Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims

his throne will have unimaginable power.

LUCIFER

All boobs and no balls.

ADRIAN

Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't

mind if I take a seat while I wait for

you.

DAD LIPS

Ahhh!

LUCIFER

I don't get no respect.

ADRIAN

Ten thousand years.  And I never once

got to sit here.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Wow.  And this is just a little taste of

my power.

DAD

Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,

get him out of the chair!

ADRIAN

Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are

a couple of million evil souls on Earth

ready to be harvested.  Anyone

interested?

NICKY

Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

CHRISTA

No, their mother's weren't angels.

ANGEL

I think they were hookers or strippers

or something really porno like...

CHUBBS

Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your

Mambo lesson.

ANGEL

Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so

sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,

Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

CHUBBS

Wow, that's terrific.

ANGEL

Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a

golf pro, but up here he's the dopest

dance instructor.

CHUBBS

You mambo?

NICKY

I don't think so.

CHUBBS

Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's

all in the hips.

NICKY

Where did you meet my father?

ANGEL

It was a long time ago, at some Heaven

and Hell mixer.

CHRISTA

I remember that night, you had like four

daiquiris.

ANGEL

Try four and a half.  At first I totally

didn't like him.

JENNA

He was really conceited.

ANGEL

But I don't know, he was funny, he made

me laugh, and I hate to say it but he

had a really nice body.

NICKY

And that made you want to make a baby

with him?

ANGEL

Well, I really wasn't thinking about

making a baby at the time!

ANGEL (CONT'D)

Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I

don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you

perv!  I'll call you back...

(laughs)

Oh my G-d, I will call you back,

goodbye.

(hangs up)

That was my friend, Michelle, she says

"hi."

NICKY

Well tell her I said "hi" back.

ANGEL

I'll call her later.

CHRISTA

You know, we saw you save your

girlfriend's life.

JENNA

That was so cool.

ANGEL

That's why you came up to Heaven instead

of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically

gets you here.

NICKY

How did you see me?

ANGEL

We can see what's going on anywhere on

Earth.  Look.

ANGEL (O.S.)

All these good people have totally been

led astray.

CHRISTA (O.S.)

Show him Central Park.

ANGEL (O.S.)

There's like a three day rave goin' on

down there.  No on is going to work

anymore.

ADRIAN

Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to

see all of you here.

NICKY (O.S.)

Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did

Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

ANGEL (O.S.)

Let's see...

RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

DAD LIPS

I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

JIMMY THE DEMON

You were the best Devil, boss, the best

Devil!

GATEKEEPER

Absolutely.

DAD LIPS

I tried to do some interesting stuff...

JIMMY THE DEMON

You did amazing stuff!

GATEKEEPER

I don't know how you came up with some

of it.

DAD LIPS

Really?  That means a lot to me.

JENNA (O.S.)

Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

ANGEL (O.S.)

I can't believe I did it with him.

ADRIAN

I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to

sin with minimal prompting.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

You're acting as if there is no Heaven

or Hell.

ADRIAN

Well, I have some news.

CARDINAL

There is most definitely a Hell!  And

you're all going there when you die!

Which will happen in about fifteen

minutes.

PREACHER

We really are gonna die!

PETER

This don't look good.

JOHN

Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get

us out of this?

TODD

They castrated him.  He can't shoot

arrows, he can't piss smoke.

BEEFY

I can't screw.

(whimpers)

I can't screw.

NICKY

Valerie's crying!

ANGEL

She's so nice.

CHRISTA

She goes to Parson's, right?

ANGEL

I would totally love to go there.  But I

hear it's really hard to get in.

NICKY

I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I

gotta help everybody.

ANGEL

Yeah, you do...

ADRIAN (V.O.)

At the stroke of midnight, my father

will be completely deteriorated.  And

all of your souls will be mine.

ADRIAN

Soon you will see things more horrible

than you can even imagine.

ADRIAN

Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I

bring you a dear sweet man and an

international icon...Henry Winkler!

ADRIAN

Covered in bees!

NICKY

But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger

and smarter than me.

ANGEL

Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.

But you have something he doesn't have.

NICKY

A speech impediment?

ANGEL

No, you have the inner light.  You can

totally use it.  It's the best power of

all.

(he smiles)

And in case you get in real bad trouble,

G-d told me to give you this.

NICKY

What is it?

ANGEL

I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d

said when the time comes, you'll know

what to do.

CHRISTA

G-d's so smart.

JENNA

The smartest.

ANGEL

Well, goodbye...for now.

(looks at his face)

Can I just do this?

ANGEL (CONT'D)

That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

FRIEND

Totally.

NICKY

Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.

(to Angel)

Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

ANGEL

It would be so okay.

NICKY

Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple

cause I'm gonna rock that town like a

hurricane.

ANGEL (O.S.)

You're already there...

NICKY

Release...the good.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Release the good...

NICKY (CONT'D)

Release the awesome.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Put it in your mouth and let it slide

down your throat-hole.

DEMON

Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

TODD

One thing I really regret is never

having experimented sexually.

PETER

You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen

Burner?  What are you talking about?

JOHN

He means getting it on with someone like

that freak.

TODD

His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

JOHN

Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

ADRIAN

You know, from this angle, you're kind

of cute.

VALERIE

You think so?  Why don't you come a

little closer and I'll show you a better

angle.

ADRIAN

Yummy.

TODD

Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and

swallowed that spit.

BEEFY

That turn you on there, RuPaul?

ADRIAN

Keep it up and I just might make you my

Queen for a night or two.

JOHN

You want a queen?  Got one right here.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

Little Nicky.

NICKY

Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the

name of all that is good: release my

friends and get in the flask.

ADRIAN

Is this a joke?

NICKY

No.  It's the inner light.  And with it

we can defeat anything you've got.

REFORMED DEMON

(eating Popeye's chicken)

It's true!

ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON

It's not true?

NICKY

Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no

choice.

EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

NICKY

Love lifts me up where I belong.

ADRIAN

Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what

you've got.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my

bare hands.

ANGEL

I totally had to do that.

ALL THE GIRLS

Yah you did.

NICKY

Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the

flas...

NICKY (CONT'D)

Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

NICKY (CONT'D)

Now will you get in the flask?

ADRIAN

Absolutely not.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

A little help over here.

ADRIAN (CONT'D)

Henry!

HENRY WINKLER

Oh no.

ADRIAN

Goodbye, Nicky.

CASSIUS (O.S.)

Come on in, bro.

CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna

bust Adrian's head wide open.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

I was going to let you out, eventually,

Cassius.  I swear.

NICKY (O.S.)

Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I

heard him keep saying.

VALERIE

Nicky!

NICKY (O.S.)

That was Cassius!

DEMON

Kill him, Adrian.

VALERIE

Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to

fight like that?

NICKY

From my dad's side of the family.

ADRIAN

What?  No tongue?

VALERIE

(whispering)

Nicky. Nicky.

VALERIE (CONT'D)

You gotta fly out...I know you can do

it.

(still no response)

Do it for the butterflies.

NICKY (O.S.)

Butterflies...

OZZY

Hello, New York.

JOHN AND PETER

Ozzy.

VALERIE

Put him in, Ozzy.

VALERIE

Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

JOHN

He'll never make it.

PETER

You gotta kill yourself.

NICKY

I'll just go to Heaven.

BEEFY

No if you do something bad right before

you die.

HENRY WINKLER

Aw, man, not again.

NICKY

Sorry, Henry.

(focuses)

Release the Evil.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Do me.

VALERIE

I love you.

NICKY

I love you.

ANGEL

Okay, you just saw my son save the

universe.  Right?!

DAD

You came through, Nicky.

NICKY

I came through for you, Mom and the

butterflies, Dad.

DAD

You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's

no butterflies here.  If you want

butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

NICKY

What about you and Grandpa and everyone

in Hell?

DAD

Nicky, I let my butterflies die once

upon a time and it's never stopped

hurting.

(Dad looks up)

That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm

still in love with you.

ANGEL

Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about

me.

DAD

And don't think I forgot about how crazy

you get after a few daiquiris.

FRIEND

That guy is still a horn dog.

DAD

Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got

up high.  You take care of the middle.

NICKY

I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley

Crue, this will always be my...home

sweet home...

JIMMY THE DEMON

Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time

for Hitler's punishment.

LUCIFER

Let me handle that.

LUCIFER (CONT'D)

And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

ADRIAN (O.S.)

No!

CASSIUS (O.S.)

Don't do it!

HITLER

Holy Schnit!

DISSOLVE TO:

LADY

Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

VALERIE

Thank yo.

LADY

Such a little angel.

BEEFY

Only a quarter, ma'am.

NICKY

Zachariah, say you're sorry.

BABY ZACHARIAH

(sounds like Nicky)

Sorry.

PREACHER

He has spilled his seed!  He is

multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the

unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

THE END.
