WASH OUT TO:

GRANT

Right calcaneus of an adult female

raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's

this tell me?

GRANT

It tells me that this bone connects to

the navicula which we already found

articulating to the cuboid.

ELLIE (off)

Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

STUDENT

Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

GRANT

So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress

fractures in the heel ...

ELLIE

She jumps.

GRANT

Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she

jump?

ELLIE

A defensive posture against a vicious,

blood-thirsty T-Rex?

GRANT

(nodding)

Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,

more tender leaves in the higher branches

with which to suckle her young?

ELLIE

I bet is was a mating ritual.

GRANT

The science of paleontology can't answer

these questions.  Novelists and artists

who dream a vision of the Jurassic period

can attempt these questions with their

imaginations.  What we scientists can say

is considering the mass and kinetic

articulation of these bones, this animal

had a vertical leap

of about twelve feet.

Not as entertaining as fiction, but

absolutely fact without prejudice.

ELLIE

Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,

we're late.  There's the car.

GRANT

Jim, you keep making up the plaster

batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,

it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after

five - when the temperature drops, those

bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I

don't want any tourists walking over my

raptor - I don't care if the Governor of

Montana is with them, just you guys.

ELLIE

You know, if ev

method like you, there would be no body

of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

GRANT

Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering

Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)

Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

ELLIE

We're leaving the raptor dig -

GRANT

- at a critical time -

ELLIE

- because Gennaro is paying us sixty

thousand dollars to observe some resort

of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

GRANT

- enough money to keep us free of

commercial affiliations for two summers.

All right, all right.  Good.

GRANT

Financial

independence for fraternizing

with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

GRANT

This is all could come up with, Skip?

GRANT

Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

MOUTH

Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

NEDRY

I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

NEDRY

You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

NEDRY

Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic

industrial espionage, and you're bound to

run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!

Part of the job description.  Look, who's

to say, who is the real scumbag?  After

all, I know what you guys need so bad.

I've heard of reverse engineering.

NEDRY

Let the other guy put in all the work,

all the R and D.  You take the finished

product, work backwards, breaking it down

to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In

a few measly months you have know-how

that took researchers ten years to

determine.  You know how much Hammond has

invested of his own personal wealth?

Over five billion dollars!  And if you

guys get the jump on his - in no time,

the market's wide-open.

NEDRY

But, boy, he's really got his product!

Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-

making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that

product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

BAKER

Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is

not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-

evaluation.

BAKER

The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

BAKER

I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

BAKER

Make sure the eggs are on that supply

ship.  Just make sure!

ROSS

We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's

under too much pressure.  There's the

EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-

vestors are getting nervous.  There have

been too many rumors, too many accidents.

We can't screw around with this.

GENNARO

I've asked Hammond to arrange independent

site inspections every week for the next

three weeks.

ROS

What does he say?

GENNARO

Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

ROSS

You know him.  Do you believe him?

GENNARO

No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with

him five years ago when we raised the

capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's

unpredictable, a dreamer.

ROSS

Potentially dangerous.  We should never

have gotten involved.  What's our position?

GENNARO

The firm owns five percent.

ROSS

General or limited?

GENNARO

General.

ROSS

We should have never done that.

GENNARO

It seemed wise at the time.  We all

wanted the park to happen.  It was in

lieu of fees.

ROSS

In any case, I agree an inspection is

overdue.  Who are your site experts?

ROSS

Will they tell the truth?

GENNARO

I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot

in his field, always goes his own way -

ROSS

- Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

GENNARO

Hammond asked to place the calls himself.

I think he wants to pretend the park is

not in trouble.  That it's just a social

invitation, showing off the island.

ROSS

All right ... Good.  But let's be very

clear about one thing.  I don't know how

bad this situation actually is, Donald.

But if there's a problem on that island -

don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn

Jurassic Park to the ground.

ROSS

Costa Rica, my ass.

PILOT

That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the

descent is a little hairy.

ELLIE

This is exciting!

GRANT

What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

GRANT

Looks like Alcatraz.

PILOT

There's bad wind shear on this peak.

smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET

ELLIE

How the hell is he landing this thing?

ELLIE

This is not fun.

GRANT

Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't

land if it weren't safe.

GRANT

Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,

Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

GENNARO

No problem.  Relax, relax.

GRANT AND ELLIE

Whoa!!!!

ELLIE

I don't like this feeling ...

NEDRY

Just think, Gennaro -

(laughs harder)

- you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,

they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,

isn't it?

NEDRY

Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

PILOT

Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a

storm alert.

REGIS

Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla

Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little

tough landing here, I know.  But you did

it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have

you.  Now, watch your step.

ED REGIS

This is Robert Muldoon, great African big

game hunter.  And he's working for us now.

Doing a bang-up job, too.

MULDOON

Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.

Gennaro, nice to have you back.

calls to Regis but is ignored.

GRANT

Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

ELLIE

Aggressive growth, huh?

GRANT

Hammond's trademark.

REGIS

Out animals are greeting you!

GRANT

I hope this isn't one of those animatronic

exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

NEDRY

Nope.

REGIS

I hope you brought your bathing suits!

Doesn't this mist and these plants really

create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

REGIS

There's the Visitor's Center.

GRANT

Where's Hammond?

REGIS

Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

GENNARO

Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the

air conditioning sucks.

ELLIE

The audicity of man to get here at the

last second and think he runs the show.

VOICE (ON P.A.)

Please come to the theater.  In a moment,

our film will begin.

Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

HAMMOND

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome

to an ancient and mysterious world, a

world long before humankind inhabited it

with all out remarkable dreams and

questions.  Enter a world that existed

one hundred million years ago.  When our

changing earth was the abode of

magnificent creations.

Today, the late twentieth century has

witnessed a scientific gold rush of

astonishing proportions:  the headlong

and furious haste to un

of genetic engineering has become more

than just a subject for science fiction

writers.

GRANT

- the furious haste to commercialize

genetic engineering.

HAMMOND

Biotechnology promises the greatest

revolution in human history.  It will

outdistance atomic power and computers in

its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll

see square trees for easy lumbering and

white trout for super visibility to

fisherman.  Why it will transform every

aspect of human life: out medical care,

our food, our health, even our very

entertainment.

GRANT

Here we go.

HAMMOND

It's literally going to change the face

of our planet as we know it.

HAMMOND

... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is

made possible through the miracle of DNA

replication, commonly known as cloning.

To explain what cloning means, I'm going

to need my own clone - John Hammond.

2ND HAMMOND

Hi, John!

HAMMOND

Hi, John.

HAMMOND

Okay John, hold out your finger.

2ND HAMMOND

Why?

HAMMOND

I need some of your

genetic material.

2ND HAMMOND

Now just a minute here, John.

HAMMOND

Your genetic material is the same in

every cell of your body.  You have a

hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a

couple.

2ND HAMMOND

OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

HAMMOND

John, let's look into your blood, the

river of life.  There's your white cells,

exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily

wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,

the heart and brain of a cell.  This

nucleus has an amazing property.  It can

sp

That's how it grows.  And then those two

can do it again.  And again.  Making copy

after copy of itself.

NEW HAMMOND'S

Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John

Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

HAMMOND

Come on, that's enough of this!  And I

thought to reproduce myself I had to do it

the old-fashioned way.

HAMMOND

That's all we've got so far.  A lot of

fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

REGIS

You bet!

HAMMOND

It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the

preceding was not your sort of enter-

tainment.  Popular science -

GRANT

No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike

the commercialization of science.  It breeds

a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

HAMMOND

Well, I don't disregard method.  But think

of mutation - which is nothing more than

sloppy communication on the cellular

level.  Think how triumphant mutations

have been in natural selection.

Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's

true that I have never been afraid to make

money with science.  I've always

considered profit to be a measure of

success, a barometer of public reaction.

GRANT

Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a

scientific law ha

public reaction.  Water freezes at

thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for

it or not.

HAMMOND

Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan

Grant, you've brought an excellent critic

to observe the viability of my island and

out venture.  I look forward to winning

you over, Dr. Grant.

ELLIE

Just what is it you're trying to clone?

LEX

Grandpa!

GENNARO

(incredulous)

Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-

tion of the island, not a weekend

excursion or a social outing.  We're

talking about the safety of this place!

HAMMOND

I'm aware of that.  But I built this

place for children.  You can't

investigate it without their reactions.

They're what this place is all about.

HAMMOND

My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.

They're more like my ex-wife than me.

GRANT

Who makes a windows ... smaller?

TIMMY

I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost

World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

LEX

Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

GRANT

Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

ELLIE

Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was

so widely successful.  He wrote if for

gra

HAMMOND

Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,

this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,

poorly funded plan that I've headed.

This is a plan to which I committed all

of my personal resources, literally

billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro

here has kindly helped me raise that sum

again from wealthy Japanese.  They love

theme parks.  I have recruited pre-

eminent scientific minds from hallowed

universities and we've taken the time to

do things right.

HAMMOND

Jurassic Park is the most advanced

amusement park in the world.  We work

with genetics - life's essential building

blocks - to create new

to make biological attractions.  Living

attractions.  Attractions so astonishing

that they'd capture the imagination of

the entire world.

GRANT

What exactly do you mean ... biological

attractions?

HAMMOND

As you well know, long ago, creatures ten

times larger than whales roamed our

adolescent Earth.  And then mass,

mysterious extinction created a time

barrier unscalable until ... now.

GRANT

Yes?

HAMMOND

Dinosaurs.

(superbly proud)

I've been cloning dinosaurs!

HAMMOND

Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not

a resort, not a scien

just a little piece of pre-history that

every child in the whole wide world will

insist on visiting.

GENNARO

At least every rich child.

HAMMOND

Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in

the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above

the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!

238 fabulous creatures so far!

TIMMY

Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want

to just kill each other?

HAMMOND

Timmy, there's electric fences and moats

and video surveillance at all times.

There

are monitors every hundred feet

whatever we could plant them on the

island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

ELLIE

You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the

right to do that?

HAMMOND

I didn't create them.  I found a way to

wake them up, to stir them out of their

prehistoric slumber.

GRANT

We don't have the science.  There's no

source of dinosaur DNA.

HAMMOND

Yes ... there is.

HAMMOND

Glitches.

HAMMOND

And this is the right side of my brain.

The entire park is safely controlled from

here.  John Arnold, that genius over

there, is the m

(with genuine concern)

John, don't smoke so much, you're far too

valuable a man to me.

ARNOLD

Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

HAMMOND

Everything's controlled from here.

Remote everything. Cars, feeding

programs, medicine dispensers, fecal

clean up - and that can be tons in a park

like this.  We run this place with twenty

workers.  This computer does it all.  And

it polices each and every single animal

out there.

ELLIE

(whispers to Grant)

Who polices the computer?

HAMMOND

That's where I will watch the astonished

watchers.  Okay, let's go.

NEDRY

Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

ARNOLD

Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical

contributions have made it all possible.

NEDRY

Right.

TIMMY

That stuff turns you into a mutant!

HAMMOND

Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal

precautions.

HAMMOND

My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and

Timmy's someday.

LEX

It's ... gold!

TIMMY

It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

LEX

Grandpa found gold.

HAMMOND

You're both right.  Amber is our gold.

The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The

precious course of our genetic material.

You already know amber is the fossilized

resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Hammond sets the scene.

HAMMOND

Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap

flowing over insects, as it does now as I

speak, in thousands of forests and backyard

trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap

trapping a little struggling insect and

consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions

and millions of years pass and we come

along and discover this prehistoric insect.

If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in

a fossil form inside the hardened sap which

is now amber.  And as we examine more and

more amber, we find many perished insects,

including among them, biting insects -

GRANT

Like mosquitos -

HAMMOND

Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

GRANT

Mosquitos that sucked the blood of

dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA

material?  My God!  It just might work.

HAMMOND

The extraction room speaks for itself.

GRANT

It does?

LEX

That's a million year old mosquito?

ELLIE

Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,

drill it out.  Right?

HAMMOND

Right.  You are witnessing the extraction

of tissue from the thorax of this humble

insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any

foreign red blood cells - say it bit a

hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we

will extract those blood cells and obtain

paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction

book of an extinct creature.

So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-

saurs. Fossils left behind the information,

the map of how to bring them back.  I'm

helping them escape from the confined of

time.

GRANT

But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't

give you enough tissue to determine a

complete DNA strand.

HAMMOND

Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like

hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are

necessary to provide even a partial

strand of DNA.  And without a complete

strand, we don't have a dinosaur.

HAMMOND

Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.

Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

WU

Finally, you are here!  I've been working

without the encouragement of my peers for

too long.  Welcome, welcome!

WU

Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and

he's interested only in results, not in

science.

HAMMOND

Don't forget to thank me when you pick up

your Nobel prize.

HAMMOND

You are standing in the middle of the

most powerful genetics factory created

since the expulsion from Eden.

WU

These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene

sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,

supercomputers that take DNA information

and organize it.  In this room, we take

fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and

compare them to other incomplete strands.

HAMMOND

It's like finding the missing pieces of a

jigsaw puzzle.

WU

The computers make sever

calculations to provide us with a

complete DNA strand - the genetic code of

an extinct animal.

GRANT

Okay, you have your "complete" DNA

strand.  How do you grow it?

WU

We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our

breeding medium.

HAMMOND

Our primordial soup.

GRANT

And how do you know what it is you're

growing?

WU

Well, we have computer techniques to try

and map out finds on an evolutionary

basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and

find out what it is.  If it's something

we're interested in, and it

keep it.

GENNARO

And if you're not interested?

LEX

Come look!

WU

This is the incubation room.  We keep the

temperature at ninetynine degrees and a

relative humidity of one hundred percent.

GRANT AND TIMMY

Jurassic atmosphere.

WU

We

also run a high oxygen concentration,

up to thirty-three percent, so if you

feel faint, please tell me right away.

LEX

I'm ... melting!

WU

Reptile eggs contain large amounts of

yolk but no water at all.  The embryos

must extract water from the surrounding

environment.

GRANT

That's why you create the mist.

WU

Children, please do not touch!  The eggs

are permeable to skin oils.

GRANT

What kind of eggs are these?  Are these

shells plastic?

WU

Yes, they are,  The embryos are

mechanically inserted and then hatched in

this room.  But we've managed to

sufficiently mimic the actual biological

process - these creatures rupture the

plastic membrane that they're contained

in when they're born.  Like real births.

WU

Eggs that are determined viable spend

their last couple days in our specially-

designed incubators, which help

accelerate the pre-natal developmental

stages.  Which is interesting becaus

we're having a problem with the adult

animals -

HAMMOND

There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.

Now who wants to see the real thing?

GENNARO

... so naturally, Hammond's going to

present everything in the best light.  I

need to know that this park is safe.

ELLIE

I'll tell you something that troubles me

from the start.  The carnivores are all

well-fed and kept separated from their

natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,

but it won't keep 'em happy.

GENNARO

How do you mean?

ELLIE

The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's

an instinct.  And that instinct will have

to be satisfied or suppressed.

HAMMOND

Gennaro is putting negative ideas into

Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have

no affection for that type of thinking.

GRANT

Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own

judgments.

REGIS

Hey!  Great day for a tour!

GENNARO

Looks like rain to me.

REGIS

No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off

till we got back.

HAMMOND

Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

HAMMOND

Gennaro, for once in your life, let

something really move you.

GENNARO

Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's

damn guinea pigs?

GRANT

I like to wait and see.

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now

entering the lost world of the

prehistoric past, a world of mighty

creatures long gone from the face of the

earth, which you are privileged to see

for the first time ...

REGIS (ON WALKIE)

That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no

expense.

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

We'll begin our tour today with the

herbivores ...

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

... and the grasses are a species of

juniper, and samples can be purchased at

the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will

take a look to the right ...

REGIS

Look ...

LEX AND TIMMY

I don't see anything.  Do you see

anything?  There's nothing there.

REGIS

Something's out there ...

GRANT

Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation

team seeing this!

REGIS

Congratulations. You're the first kids in

the whole wide world ever to see real

dinosaurs.

kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

ELLIE

Alan?  Alan?

(sort of delighted)

He fainted!

GENNARO

My God, we're going to make a fortune

here!

HAMMOND

He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to

impress that young man.

ARNOLD

Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt

you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

HAMMOND

Oh, balls.

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich

dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,

have a very strong nesting instinct ...

GRANT

Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do

with the rest of our lives?

ELLIE

What to you mean?

GRANT

Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones

that are extinct now.

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

... lots more to see in the herbivore

section of our park.  But as we come

alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the

left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a

very unusual and dangerous carnivore.

Look across the river and above ...

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

And there they are!

ALL THREE

Dilophosaurus!

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest

carnivores.  Scientists once thought

their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,

but now, through the miracle of their

cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,

a poison which causes blindness and then

unconsciousness.

GENNARO

Poisonous d

issue without a lot of precedent.

GRANT

(assessing)

It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's

a poison ...

ELLIE

Spitter!

ELLIE

Are we dreaming all this?

MULDOON

These raptors are too damn dangerous. One

of them tunneled out this morning.  He

ripped a boy's arm off before I could get

a bullet in him.

HAMMOND

A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I

have five left?

MULDOON

John, they're mean as scorpions and smart

as chimps.  Their little fingers make

them natural cage-breakers.  We should

terminate the raptor program.  They're

just too smart.  Too damn smart.

HAMMOND

Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors

just because they're behaving normally.

They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them

properly?

MULDOON

John, remember back in '88, when we

started to build the containment devices?

We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns

that blow out electric nets.  They're all

too slow for these guys. If we're going

to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles

and laser-guided devices.

HAMMOND

It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure

out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit

down and have a nice long discussion about

raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

MULDOON

Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round

the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.

And wear your rifle when you're working!

HAMMOND

Wh

ARNOLD

They'll be by the trike's in a moment.

Trike's sick again.

HAMMOND

How can you say it so matter-of-factly?

The trike's.  You casually accept it, but

I never can.  You know what it means when

you say "by the trikes"?  "By the

trike's" means that they're out there by

the species:  triceratops horridus.  It

astounds me every time what I've done

here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We

turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.

I will never be complacent about that.

RADIO

Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the

dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns

just south of us.  Requesting permission

to leave before unloading the last three

food containers.

RADIO

Don't want to be stuck here if this chop

gets much worse.

NEDRY

Coffee anyone?

HAMMOND

Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you

tonight?  I certainly don't want to

imperil anyone.  But can you give us one

more container of food?  Then we'll feel

comfortable is the storm delays your

return.  Could you help us out here?  Of

course, if it looks too choppy just go,

but you'd be doing us a big favor.

RADIO

Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll

get one more container off. How's that?

LEX

I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

VET

We don't know what's wrong with Freda.

Every six we

REGIS

Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.

After a big night, I feel the same way.

GRANT

Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,

look at this.

ELLIE

Microvesicles.  Interesting.

LEX

Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

HARDING

We make these dinosaurs in the lab,

sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.

Freda has a little one that follows her

around, thinks Freda's his mom.

ELLIE

What does sh

HARDING

Animal this size takes in a minimum of

six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We

truck in hay and meadow grasses seven

times a day.  That's all she touches.

ELLIE

West Indian Lilacs!

GRANT

These'd give anybody a stomachache.

HARDING

I'm telling you, the animals don't eat

don't eat that stuff.

TIMMY

Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?

GRANT

Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good

work, Timmy.

ELLIE

Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could

be those lilac berries.

HARDING

I don't get it.

GRANT

Looks like your trike swallows stones to

help her digest her food.  Walking

around, she crushes berries against the

stones.  And even just a little crushed

berry is eventually enough,

ELLIE

So, she poisons herself periodically.

HARDING

Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

GRANT

But with th

and probably bypasses any mucosal

contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I

would test her excrement.

LEX

Yo, yuk!

GENNARO

Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?

It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

ELLIE

I'm staying.

GRANT

Soil samples?

ELLIE

You read my mind.

(confidentially)

I think she's sicker then they're saying.

Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums

are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

GRANT

Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

NEDRY (INTO RADIO)

Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know

a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so

tightly planned ... that's not enough ...

ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

TOUR

The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur

history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a

hundred and twenty million years, but

there were tyrannosaurs for only the last

fifteen million years of that period ...

REGIS (TO WALKIE)

You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to

come here in the evening and just sit.

GRANT (OVER WALKIE)

Where is the T-

REGIS (TO WALKIE)

Good question.

GRANT

Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

REGIS (OVER WALKIE)

Would if she could, believe me.  Some-

times she stands by the lagoon and stares

at those animals, and wiggles those

little forearms of hers in frustration.

But the T-Rex territory is completely

enclosed with trenches and fences.

Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

GRANT

Then where is she?

MULDOON

Just checking in.  Everything ok?

HAMMOND

Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,

so eager.  They can't wait to see it.

They have come for the danger.

MULDOON

That's what I'm afraid of.

LEX

What's going to happen to the goat?  Is

the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

GRANT

He's here.

REGIS

Looks like the Rex will have its snack a

little later today.

RECORDED VOICE

The sensors don't see the Rex around.

She usually comes within five minutes of

hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that

means she's sleeping - we might have

access to her at the picnic area.

LEX

I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I

liked the goat.

GENNARO (MONITOR

What is a carnivore got out?

GRANT (MONITORED)

There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no

natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting

instinct.

HAMMOND

Damn those people.  They are so negative.

ARNOLD

It's natural.  They can't fully

appreciate that we've engineered the

animals and the park for total safety.

HAMMOND

They comb this island like a bunch of

accountants.  They don't experience the

wonder, the awe of it all.

ARNOLD

You can't make people experience wonder.

HAMMOND

It's like the Garden of Eden out there.

This is the most beautiful time of day.

ARNOLD

Better rout the tour back.  They can

start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

HAMMOND

Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be

hungry when they get in.

NEDRY

Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the

lines to upload some data.

NEDRY

I'll clear a couple of lines for you at

the end of the next transmission, sir.

Here you go now, this will make it all

better, Mr. Hammond.

PRE-RECORDED VOICE

... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also

a good time to ...

LEX

Hey, is that bathroom working?

REGIS

Sure.

(he uses his walkie)

Rest stop.

GRANT

Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

REGIS

Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't

know why not.  Probably too much

construction.

NEDRY

Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend

for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.

Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will

be clear in five minutes.

HAMMOND

Slob!

ARNOLD

Well, at least he knows what he's doing.

REGIS

Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary

glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,

they're going to re-rout some circuits

back at the mainframe.  We'll have the

power back on in moments.  Let's get back

in the cruisers, they may start up, and

I'd like us all to be seated in them.

GENNARO

I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

LEX

Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

REGIS

No, darling, of course not.

LEX

Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

REGIS

Don't you worry about d

all very safe in their paddocks just like

animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not

going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

NEDRY

Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

HAMMOND

What's going on, Arnold?  I want those

lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren

scared.

ARNOLD

Jesus, the computer's gone

down.

HAMMOND

Well, I want the computer up.  This is

the wrong weekend for glitches.

ARNOLD

That's not the worst of it.

HAMMOND

Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse

than the lights going out?

WU

All the security doors are open.  Someone

has been in my laboratory and the eggs

have been disturbed.

HAMMOND

Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?

Did anybody check the damn john?

MULDOON

John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut

the power?

HAMMOND

Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring

back the tour right away.  I don't need

any of this!

NEDRY

Oh, shit!

MULDOON

Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.

There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,

Hammond'll fill you in.

ELLIE

No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

CAPTAIN FARRELL

Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

NEDRY

Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll

never know I was gone.

(yells after the men with the incubator)

Careful with that thing!  It's worth more

than the ship.

(to the Captain)

When's the copter meeting you?

CAPTAIN FARRELL

It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,

nobody could land on the water.

NEDRY

(totally panicked)

Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like

this.  Maybe we should do it another time,

I don't like it.  I just don't like -

CAPTAIN FARRELL

Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at

the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be

able to make that in time.

NEDRY

(somewhat relieved)

Ten hours?

CAPTAIN FARRELL

Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on

this too, you know.  No one's going to

mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess

up.  His people won't let him.

NEDRY

Ok.  Ok.  Here.

NEDRY

Look, this is insulating spray.

hand,

NEDRY

In about eight hours, spray down all the

eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em

warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has

it together with the dock.

TIMMY

Hey, these thing work great.  I can see

in the dark and I can see far.

TIMMY

Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still

there?  It is. I think they're getting

ready to go.

REGIS

Timmy, can you

give her the goggles?

TIMMY

Want to look at the boat, Lex?

LEX

Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he

gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX

They have one of those things from the

room with all the eggs - you know, where

they help the baby eggs grow up.

TIMMY

You mean an incubator?

GRANT (ON WALKIE)

What's the commotion?

REGIS

Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

TIMMY (TO WALKIE)

Uh, Dr. Grant?

TIMMY

We saw that computer guy helping 'em load

an incubator onto the ship.

LEX (TO WALKIE)

Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!

He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

GRANT (ON WALKIE)

Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

REGIS (TO WALKIE)

(finally acknowledges)

That's what they saw.

GRANT (TO WALKIE)

We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right

away.  How far is it to the mainland?

REGIS (TO WALKIE)

Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.

About a sixteen hour voyage in this

weather.

GRANT

I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running

around Costa Rica.

GENNARO

When's the damn power coming on?

MULDOON

Strong legs.

ELLIE

Lot of track in college.

LEX

I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

REGIS

When the electricity comes back on,

honey.  These cars run on electric cables

buried in the road.

REGIS

Must be turning on the electricity.

LEX

Feels like a vibration.

REGIS

Jesus Christ.

LEX

Bad language.

REGIS

Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't

electrified.

LEX

Is that bad?

TIM

Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you

going?

LEX

He just left us.  He just left us all

alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do

that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

GRANT (ON WALKIE)

Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.

GENNARO

Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do

now?

GRANT

Can't think of a thing.

GRANT

Don't move.

LEX

It's too, too dark out there.

GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)

Shut that flashlight, Tim!

LEX

No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

TIMMY

Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

TIMMY

(softly)

Lex?  Lex?

Extinct animals should stay extinct!

TIMMY

Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

GRANT

Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

GRANT

Try the door you're leaning against.

Nice and slow.

GRANT

Crawl this way.  Slowly.

GRANT

We're going to have to make a jump for

it, Timmy.  Okay?

GRANT

One, two, three, jump.

TIMMY

Thanks, Dr. Grant.

GRANT

You owe me one.

GRANT

Where'd Lex go?

TIMMY

There's Lex.

she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head

GRANT

Come on out now, Lex.

TIMMY

It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

TIMMY

I found your baseball.

LEX

You did?

GRANT

Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.

And tight.  Why don't you come out?

LEX

I'm afraid of the "animals".

TIMMY

The "animals" are gone.

LEX

Where did it go?

TIMMY

I don't kno

LEX

Are there any grownups out there?

GRANT

I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie

you hand, come on, here you go.

LEX

I'm hungry.

GRANT

Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back

to civilization.

REGIS

Noooooo!

TIMMY

What's going on?

GRANT

It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But

it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see

him.  Evidently, he can only see move-

ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

REGIS

You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go

away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

GRANT

Let's go!

ELLIE

Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

MULDOON

Ellie!

MULDOON

Wait up.

MULDOON

T-Rex tracks.

ELLIE

Then they must be out there.  They must

be out there.  I know it.

MULDOON

Perhaps.

ELLIE

No!  They're out there.

MULDOON

I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the

bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to

see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or

exposed bones.  There is usually little or

no evidence left behind.  And if

victims

are small, a predator can kill by just

shaking the little thing to death, eating

it, and leave not so much as a button.

MULDOON

Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.

First I have to ...

MULDOON

He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

ELLIE

Looks like you've been through this

before.

MULDOON

I told you I've seen big game attacks in

Africa.

ELLIE

Right.

WU

Why?

ARNOLD

Because Nedry messed with the code.

That's why I'm checking it.

WU

But that could take weeks.  What would be

faster?  Try keychecks.

ARNOLD

That's true.  Keychecks will give me a

record of every button Nedry pushed.

ARNOLD

Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?

He was just dicking around, maybe waiting

to get his nerve up.

WU

What's that?

ARNOLD

Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can

trace it.

WU

What's it mean?

ARNOLD

It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that

fat bastard left for himself.  When he

hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of

commands that turned the whole goddamn

park off.  Hammond was right about him.

WU

If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it

back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure

Nedry did.  You're find it.

MULDOON

We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.

Harding's tending to him in your

quarters.  He'll be all right if we can

radio for help.  Your grandchildren and

Grant are somewhere in the park.  I

believe they're alive but I don't know

where they are.

HAMMOND

I'm sure you'll find them.

MULDOON

I certainly hope so.

HAMMOND

I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep

telling everyone, this park is made for

children.

MULDOON

Just so you understand that they're

missing, sir.

HAMMOND

Missing?  Of course I know they're

missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,

let's not get carried away.  We've had a

little breakdown from the storm or

whatever, and as a result we've had a

regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And

that's all that happened.  We're dealing

with it.  Arnold will get the computers

cleaned up, and

the radio and phone lines

open.  You'll find those kids and my good

friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want

some of this ice cream.  It's very good.

GENNARO

That Rex didn't even give me his full

attention.  That's what hurts.  I was

just an afterthought.  I gave him my full

attention.

HARDING

He's had a lot of morphine.

GENNARO

(sings)

Not enough.

ELLIE

I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few

tests in his lab.

HARDING

He's probably in the control room, get-

ting in the way while Arnold tries to put

things together.

GENNARO

Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...

MATCH CUT TO:

LEX

I'm tired.

TIMMY

You're too big to be carried.

LEX

But I'm tired-tired.

GRANT

Okay, Lex.

GRANT

Oof!  You're heavy.

GRANT

I think we're still in his paddock.

GRANT

What?

LEX

Don't you see?  Don't you see?

GRANT

What?

LEX

The fence.

GRANT

(squinting)

No.

TIMMY

Oh I do, right there!

LEX

Timmy's scared of heights.

TIMMY

Shut up.

GRANT

Okay with the fence, Timmy?

LEX

(mumbles quietly)

'Fraid of heights.

GRANT

A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

TIM

We gonna walk all night?

GRANT

Twelve hours before that ship reaches the

mainland.

TIM

We need sleep.

GRANT

Up there.

TIM

Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

GRANT

Sure you can.

TIMMY

(mumbles)

It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

CUT TO:

WU

What is taking Arnold so long?  This room

is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

ELLIE

No sign of those berries.  Really

interesting.  There are indications of a

similar virus in every tissue sample.

But it's not in the ground.  Could I look

at some of the discarded embryos?

WU

I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a

similar one.  All animals carry many

viruses

almost impossible to say with certainty

which are the same strains.

ELLIE

And yet from what Harding tells me, many

of you animals have similar symptoms -

besides the microvesicles, a lack of

hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores

in the mouth and gums.

WU

What the hell does Harding know?  He's a

veterinarian, not a pathologist.

MULDOON

What is it?

ARNOLD

That's it.

MULDOON

That's what?

ARNOL

I found the command to restore the

original code.  It resets the linked

parameters.

MULDOON

The fences and the power?

ARNOLD

Right.  And it does something else. It

erases the code lines that refer to it.  It

destroys all evidence it was ever there.

MULDOON

Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and

reset the whole show.  No one would ever

miss him.

ARNOLD

Watch this.

ARNOLD

Hot damn!

MULDOON

Are the fences back on?

ARNOLD

You bet they are.  It will take a few

seconds to get up to full power, because

we've got fift

and the generator has to feed the

capacitors along the way.  But in a half

a minute we'll be back in business.

MULDOON

Motion sensors?

ARNOLD

Got them too.   It will be a few minutes

while the computer counts.  Then I'll

tell you where Grant and the kids are and

you can go and get them.  But every-

thing's working.  Half past ten and we've

got the whole thing back up and running.

MULDOON

Just hiss.

MULDOON

What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

ARNOLD

There's a lot of extraneous movement out

there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-

ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,

count's finished.

ARNOLD

Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're

out of range of a sensor.

MULDOON

Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I

wish I could go out there   But I haven't

got anything to use on the Rex.  My

rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry

stole.  And going out with a big gun in

the dark would be suicide

ELLIE

Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?

I'm just going to run a couple more tests

and then I'm going to turn in myself.

WU

No point in everyone being exhausted.

WU

I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as

soon as there is light.

DISSOLVE TO:

MULDOON

Where the hell are they going?

MULDOON

Let's see what's up.

GRANT

Tim, I think there's a motion sensor

across the field and down there.

TIM

Where's Lex?

LEX

C'mere boy, c'mere.

LEX

It's very, very good.

LEX

C'mere boy, c'mere.

TIM

Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

LEX

Whoa!

LEX

Giddyup!

LEX

Whoa!!  Take is easy!

LEX

I can't swim!

GRANT

Go home now.  Home to Freda!

LEX

Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride

him.  He could carry me instead of you,

Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

GRANT

Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

LEX

Will I ever play with him again?

GRANT

We gotta get to that motion detector.

It's still a ways.

MULDOON

I found Nedry!

BEARDED WORKE

I found him!

BALD WORKER (OFF)

Found him!

HAMMOND

He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope

you're not going to take this little

mishap you had and hold it against my

park.  It would be terrible if the

finishing funds were in any way held up.

HAMMOND

You really shouldn't have gotten out of

the vehicle.  The park is actually quite

safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged

some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,

all loyal employees, are righting damage

as we speak.

GENNARO

Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's

more than we ever dreamed!  Those

brachiosaurs are so big!  And those

Spitters -

(he spits)

- incredible!  I only have one problem.

Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?

(he frowns, smacks his forehead)

Oh, they'd fly away!

HAMMOND

Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you

seen these?  These are great.

HAMMOND

Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

HAMMOND

I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur

bingo, hey ...

HAMMOND

Wu says he can make a foot high

triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living

souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only

food we sell, of course.

HARDING

You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.

He's doped to infinity and back.

WU

Who gave you permission -

ELLIE

I'm here to investigate this park. And

there's

plenty you haven't told me.

WU

That's absurd.

ELLIE

These bones aren't fully formed.

WU

You're qualified to interpret x-rays of

living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took

me many months to learn.

Y

I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't

an adult, just a huge juvenile.

WU

You're making a lot of assumptions here.

ELLIE

Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

HAMMOND (OFF)

Growth hormones.

WU

She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

HAMMOND

Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious

problem.

(to

These animals don't last.  There is a

regularity, a predictability about when

they die.  It's always ... very young.

We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure

Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

WU

Just some adjustment in the code is

required.

HAMMOND

But there are deadlines.  The park opens

next summer. And it requires full-grown

specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to

achieve the desired size in a short

amount of time.  But they all keep dying

and we don't know how to stop it.

HAMMOND

I was going to tell you all this myself,

Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped

breathing down my neck.  That's why I

wanted you and Dr. Grant

dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help

me?

CUT TO:

ELLIE

Gennaro's losing a lot of blood.

He

needs transfusions.  We gotta get a

rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with

the phones?

ARNOLD

Ah hell. I just can't find it.

ELLIE

Find what?

ARNOLD

Nedry jammed all the communication lines.

He inserted some command, a lockout into

the program code.  I can't find it,

because I gave that restore command and

it erased part of the program listings.

WU

So?  Just reset - shut the system down

and you'll clear the memory.  Everything

will be in the normal wakeup mode.

ARNOLD

Shut the system down?

WU

And reset.

ARNOLD

I've never done that before.  And I'm

reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr

systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

ELLIE

Look, there is a sick man here who needs

medical attention or he'll die.  Four

people are out there, missing in your

park.  We need search teams.  We have to

have a phone or radio.

ELLIE

Well?

ARNOLD

Well, it's just that the safety systems

don't function with the computer shut

down and -

ELLIE

- turn the goddamn safety systems off!

Can't you get it through your head that

we have no choice?

ARNOLD

Okay.

You asked for it.  And you got it.

How long do we have to wait?

Thirty seconds.

No we're not.  Phones still dead.

The duckbills.

WU

My good God.

ELLIE

What?

ARNOLD

It's the Rex ...

HAMMOND

They've stampeded ...

- A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

TIMMY

Let's go.  Now!

HAMMOND

No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed

one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

ARNOLD

I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

HAMMOND

My animals!  My animals!

HAMMOND

Where have you been?  My Rex killed a

hadrosaur.  You should be out there,

doing something.

MUL

I just came to tell you - you're minus

one computer expert.

GRANT

We'll walk by the river.  That leads back

to the Visitor's center.

LEX

Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

TIMMY

Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

LEX

Nope.  Too scared.

GRANT

You ready?

Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't

have to walk so close to the animals!

GRANT

What raft?

LEX

Where I found Freda's baby.

It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at

least ten miles to go.  If we take the

raft along the river, we can make much

faster progress.

TIMMY

Let's do it.

GRANT

Lex, I don't see any raft.

TIMMY

Keep going.

GRANT

Bullseye!

LEX

Told you!

GRANT

No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

LEX

Actually, I never really saw one. Just

assumed.

GRANT

Assumed?

TIMMY

Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

TIMM

Look, Lex!  Look!

GRANT

I'm afraid there's no raft.

GRANT

Looks pretty calm.

about elbow deep.

LEX

I'll row, Dr. Grant.

GRANT

No.

LEX

Hey, we're still moving.

GRANT

There's a current.

LEX

You can't sleep.

GRANT

I'm not sl

LEX

I'll do it!

TIMMY

We gotta warn them about the boat.

TIMMY

Cool!

TIMMY

Thought

is looked calm?

GRANT

Guess I was wrong.

LEX

I can't swim!

GRANT

Hold on real tight.

TIMMY

Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

TIMMY

Don't let go!

TIMMY

You can do it!

GRANT

I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

GRANT

No!!!!!

CUT TO:

MULDOON

Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.

Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

HAMMOND

Could he drown in that position?  That's

a very valuable animal.

MULDOON

I know it's a valuable animal.

WU

What's that, John?

ELLIE

You running on auxiliary power?

ARNOLD

I'm not.

WU

Looks like you are.

ARNOLD

Can't be.

WU

Print the system status log.

What the hell is going on?

HAMMOND

You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

HAMMOND

Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

I'm going to put it all back together for

you - I promise.  I will

LEX

The waterfall stopped.

TIMMY

Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

GRANT

I think they cut the power.  Hey -

GRANT

Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,

kids.

HAMMOND

Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

WU

You shut down as six thirty-four this

morning, and when you started back up, it

was with auxiliary power.

ARNOLD

Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up

first and then that's used to start the

main generator because it needs a heavy

charge.  The main generator has to be

manually reset.

WU

Outside?  In

the generator building?

MULDOON

This doesn't mean the fences have been

off since six-thirty, does it?

ARNOLD

Backup power doesn't generate enough

amperage to power the electrified fences,

so they were automatically kept off.

That's also why we had no phones or

radio.

MULDOON

All of the fences?

ARNOLD

Yes.

MULDOON

Including the velociraptor mesh?

ARNOLD

(disgusted, exhausted)

Yes, yes, yes.

HAMMOND

Do you mean those raptor

ARNOLD

I'm afraid so.

MULDOON

No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two

days to chew through that mesh.  But give

'em enough time, they'll get out.  We

better get that power on now.

HAMMOND

Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure

there' five of them there.

ARNOLD

What's that steam coming out of my

generator room?

MULDOON

Relax, it's just refrigerated air.

There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it

a couple times before but the original

installation was at too sharp an angle.

MULDOON

Just go and turn on your generator, then

get right back to the control room.

MULDOON

Raptors chewed their way out.  All five

are out there.

ELLIE

Arnold's not with you?

MULDOON

I was hoping he was ba

HAMMOND

This is why my quarters were specially

fortified.  To assist in an emergency just

like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round

up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

ELLIE

Wait.  What about Arnold?

TIMMY

We're home!

GRANT

Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

TIM

That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me

one.

MULDOON

Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every

moment.  But this shell carries quite a

punch, so if you're too close, it'll take

a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset

with you.  If another ones come at you,

let her know.  Then Ellie - you start

jumping and yelling.  The buggers are

easily distracted.  They'll come running

and let Wu get that power on.  Then both

of you, get behind this fence as quick as

possible.

MULDOON

Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

ELLIE

Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't

catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you

flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

MULDOON

You ok?

WU

Now, there's four.

ELLIE

I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door

after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

ELLIE

Damn, I banged my head.

WU (OVER RADIO)

Oh that's good, that must be the water

pipe.  You're really close now, there's a

cabinet just above your head.  Reach up

and open it.  The handle turns to the

left.

WU (OVER RADIO)

It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,

count to three, and push it back up.

That's all there is to it.

ELLIE

WU

Keep it open!  I'm coming!

ELLIE

Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

ELLIE

They're coming inside!

WU

Help!

MULDOON

No they're not, Ellie.

MULDOON

I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

ELLIE

Why didn't the power go on?

MULDOON

You just reset the power.  Now the

computer has to be booted.

LEX

Where did everybody go?

GRANT

Probably your grandfather's quarters.

Let's go.

GRANT

Actually, stay here.

LEX

No, I want to stay with you.

GRANT

No, keep an eye on things round here for

me.  I'll be back with the others.

TIMMY

What about -

GRANT

I'll radio the ship as soon as I find

somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.

Don't move from here ... unless you have

to, ok?

LEX

Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

TIMMY

Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

GRANT

Be right back.

ELLIE

Why don't you just nail that bastard?

MULDOON

No more ammo.  I requisitioned six

charges but the bean-counter -

Any candy behind the counter?

TIMMY

Hungry?

Starved.

TIMMY

Nothing.

Let's go to the kitchen.

Nope.  We're waiting here t

TIMMY

Start winding now!

LEX

Where are we going?

TIM

The kitchen!

ELLIE

How long?

MULDOON

Well, they seem to be getting faster all

the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

ELLIE

There's a raptor on the roof of this

building.  Open that gate and you're a

dead man.

GRANT

Ellie, I'm go glad -

ELLIE

Shut up and listen.  We have about

fifteen minutes here.  The computer has

to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the

electric fences.  Besides the r

stuck in here with us, there are four

more ...

TIMMY

We'll freeze to death in there.

LEX

He's going to eat us!

TIMMY

PUSH!

LEX

What is it, Timmy?

TIMMY

I just remembered something.  Rapto

born in large litters.  There's probably

more coming.  We gotta hide.

GRANT (TO RADIO)

Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

GRANT

Timmy, you know anything about computers?

TIMMY

Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told

my Dad I wanted a 386.

GRANT

Ok good, you're elected.

GRANT (TO RADIO)

Okay, we've reached the computer room.

Who can te

ELLIE (OVER RADIO)

Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot

the computer.  Please hurry, we've only

got a couple minutes left.

GRANT

Tim, you got to book the system.  They

reset the power and there are no phones.

We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta

stop that ship.

LEX

Are they going to be ok?

GRANT

If we can get help very soon.

TIMMY

Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

GRANT (TO RADIO)

Ellie, we're working as fast as we can

here.

ELLIE (ON RADIO)

Ok, we're all right here for now.

Thanks.

GRANT (TO RADIO)

Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

ELLIE (ON RADIO)

But there's still one more raptor.  So be

careful.

TIM

I think this is the boat.  They called it

the Queen Anne or something.

GRANT

Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

RADIO

This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.

What's up?

GRANT

Report your position!

RADIO

Ah, we're just about to dock here in

Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please

identify yourself.

GRANT

Try this for identification, Captain

Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen

biological materials.  If you don't turn

that boat around and return to Isla

Nublar immediately with your contraband

cargo, you will be found in violation of

Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,

you will be subject to revocation of

license, penalties in excess of fifty

thousand dollars, and five years in jail.

Do you copy?

GRANT

Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

RADIO

I copy.  All ahead stern.

TIMMY

What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

GRANT

Who the hell knows?

LEX

What good does that do?  To have the ship

turn around?

GRANT

Well it gives us ten more hours.

(to Timmy)

Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican

Coast Guard on that thing.

GRANT

(grimly)

And then there were none.

HAMMOND

Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful

place.  I need a man just like you to

help me get my park back on its feet

again.  And it will be on its feet again.

GRANT

We have to leave now.

HAMMOND

Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful

plans in the works, sites already

purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic

Japan.

HAMMOND

Don't you see I've exalted human

potential here?  You must see it.  You

must feel it.  I called back a life form.

Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part

of this.  I'm inviting you to do just

that - let the others go, if they want.

GRANT

You interrupted natural law.  There are

regulations,

rules that nature follows

that make her knowable.

HAMMOND

You mean there are rules that nature

follows that create barriers to our

knowledge.

GRANT

Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth

spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire

solar system in interlocking motion.  Our

own beings in biological step with it

all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the

pattern and look what it's done!

HAMMOND

I know what it's done.  I've made

triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.

I've got a batch of iguanadons being born

on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

GRANT

Don't count on it.  Now get in.

GRANT

You created mutant forms that you further

mutated to create amus

You made biological puppets with

heartbeats and an early death sentence.

HAMMOND

I created genetic miracles!

GRANT

You created a park to generate a profit-

making merchandising operation.

HAMMOND

The merchandise is just a by-product.

Souvenirs for people to reflect on the

wonder.  You fainted when you saw the

brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not

argue.  The problem is that my employees

were not up to par with my dream.  They

failed me.  The park, I promise you, is

safe.  It really is.

GRANT

You park is doomed.  Now come with me.

HAMMOND

It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes

of labor!  You are one more more negative

voice in a

You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a

bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

GRANT

Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

ELLIE

They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,

aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments

had the same viral contamination.

GRANT

I have a theory.

ELLIE

You have a theory?

GRANT

I think that they could never completely

isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was

always some microscopic mosquito

contamination.  But at the molecular

level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur

received the same genetic massage, the

encoding that every mosquito gets to

terminate life after a season.

ELLIE

So the very process itself was flawed.

RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT.
