MCGRAW

Hot goddamn day!

PETE

Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with

the air conditioner blastin' all day

long.

MCGRAW

Not even for lunch?

PETE

I'm by myself today, ate my lunch

outta the microwave.

MCGRAW

Jesus Christ man, that microwave food

will kill ya as quick as a bullet.

Those burritos are only fit for a

hippie high on weed. Pull me down a

bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'

tanked tonight.

PETE

Whatsamatter?

MCGRAW

(sighs)

Awww, it's just been a shitass day.

Every inch of it hot and miserable.

First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip

got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid

boy of hers was workin' the grill.

That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit

from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast

at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a

blanket like a sick dog by ten

thirty.

PETE

Isn't there a law or something

against retards serving food to the

public?

MCGRAW

Well, if there ain't there sure oughta

be. Who knows what goes on inside

Mongoloid's mind?

PETE

You could sue the shit out of her, ya

know. That kid belongs under a circus

tent, not flippin' burgers. You could

own that fuckin' place.

MCGRAW

What the hell would I do with that

grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got

enough of a cross to bear just taking

care of that potato head. Then all

this Abilene shit happened. You

heard about that bank robbery in

Abilene, didn't ya?

PETE

That's all that's been on the box

all day. They killed some people

didn't they?

MCGRAW

Four Rangers, three cops, and two

civilians. And they took a lady bank

teller as a hostage.

MCGRAW

They'll probably make a run for the

border, which would bring 'em this

way. And if we get our hands on

those shit asses, we're talking

payback time. We'll get 'em all right.

I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your

commode.

PETE

Knock yourself out.

BLACK SUITED MAN #1

(to Pete)

Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with

you, asshole?

(points to the tearful prep

school girl)

Do you want this little girl to die?

(pointing to the blonde with

the other guy)

Or that little girl? Or your

bosombuddy with the badge? Or

yourself? I don't wanna do it, but

I'll turn this fuckin' store into the

Wild Bunch if I even think you're

fuckin' with me.

PETE

What do you want from me? I did what

you said.

SETH

Letting him use your toilet? No store

does that.

PETE

He comes in here every day and we

bullshit. He's used my toilet a

thousand times. If I told him no,

he'd know something was up.

SETH

I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta

here, in his car, and down the road or

you can change the name of this

place to "Benny's World of Blood."

SETH

Were you giving that pig signals?

PETE

What? Are you kidding? I didn't do

anything!

SETH

He says you were scratching.

PETE

I wasn't scratching!

SETH

You callin' him a liar?

PETE

I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm

simply saying that if I was

scratching, and if I did scratch, it's

not because I was signaling the cop,

it's because I'm fuckin' scared

shitless.

RICHARD

The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't

I just go in there, blow his head off

and get outta here.

PETE

Don't do that! Look, you asked me to

act natural, and I'm acting as natural

-- in fact, under the circumstances, I

think I ought get a fuckin' Academy

Award for how natural I'm acting. You

asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing

my best.

SETH

Yeah, well, your best better get a

helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're

gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot

worse.

SETH

Everybody be cool.

MCGRAW

Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at

it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit

in front of the box and just drink

booze. How much is the bottle?

PETE

Six-fifty.

SETH

(to Richard)

What the fuck was that about?

RICHARD

(in a low monotone)

He signaled the Ranger.

PETE

(hysterical)

I didn't.

(to Seth)

You gotta believe me, I didn't.

RICHARD

(to Seth)

When they were talkin', he mouthed

the words "Help Us."

PETE

You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

SETH

What the fuck is wrong with you --

RICHARD

Seth, he did it. You were by the beer

cooler with your back turned. I was by

the magazines, I could see his face.

And I saw him mouth:

SETH

Start the car.

RICHARD

You believe me don't cha?

SETH

Shut up and start the car.

SETH

(yelling)

Richie? You okay?

RICHARD

(yelling)

I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!

I told you that bastard said, "Help

us!"

PETE

(yelling)

I never said help us!

SETH

(yelling)

Well that don't matter now, 'cause

you got about two fuckin' seconds

to live! Richie!

RICHARD

(yelling)

Yeah?

SETH

(yelling)

When I count three, shoot out the

bottles behind him!

RICHARD

Gotcha!

SETH

One... Two... Three.

SETH

What did I tell you? What did I tell

you? Buy the road map and leave.

RICHARD

What am I supposed to do, Seth?

He recognized us.

SETH

He didn't recognize shit.

RICHARD

Seth, I'm telling you, the way he

looked at us -- you especially --

I knew he knew.

SETH

Low profile. Do you know what the

words "low profile" mean?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FORT STOCKTON

238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER

JACOB

We got about two more hours of day

light left. That'll get us into

El Paso, which is right next to the

border. We'll stop at a motel --

SCOTT

Stop? We're not going to actually

stop at a motel, are we?

SCOTT AND KATE

We've got a Winnebago. We don't need

those over priced roach havens. We're

self contained.

JACOB

Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little

overzealous, but give me a break, I

just bought it.

SCOTT

Why, just look at all this. You got

your kitchen --

KATE

-- you got your microwave --

SCOTT

-- you got your sink --

KATE

-- you got your shower --

SCOTT

-- see this, television!

KATE

Feel this, real wood paneling. That's

real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

JACOB

Unless you two wiseacres wanna be

introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,

what say we drop this?

SCOTT

(to Kate)

The truth hurts.

KATE

(to Scott)

It's the bitterest of pills.

JACOB

You two ought to start a stand-up

act, because you're just wasting your

humor on me.

KATE

Ain't it the truth.

SCOTT

Why do you want to stop?

JACOB

I'm exhausted.

SCOTT

Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us

into Mexico.

JACOB

I just bet you would. Don't even thin

about it. Besides, I want to have one

night's sleep in an

honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in

the home are okay, but they're not

like a real bed.

KATE

Hey, if we go to a motel, we can

swim.

SCOTT

I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to

the bathroom.

KATE

Dad, when I called the machine to

check our messages there was one from

Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he

wouldn't permanently replace you until

we came back. He said when we come

home, if you still feel the same

way --

JACOB

That's very nice of Ted, but I'll

call him tomorrow and tell him not

to bother waiting.

KATE

I didn't want to talk about this in

front of Scott because he gets upset.

But you don't believe in God

anymore?

JACOB

Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I

know this is hard on you kids. After

Jenny's death, this is probably the

last thing you need. But I can't do

it any longer. My congregation needs

spiritual leadership. Well, they can't

get that from me anymore. My faith is

gone. To answer your question, yes,

I do believe in Jesus. But do I love

them? No. After Jenny died, I just

thought, what's the point?

KATE

(pushing him)

It's just, all our lives you've been

a pastor. For twenty years you've

preached trust in the lord. And then

one day you wake up and say fuck him?

JACOB

I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not

connected anymore.

KATE

That happens, you'll get it back.

JACOB

Kate, give your old man a little

credit. Every person who chooses the

service of God as their life's work

has something in common. I don't care

if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,

a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,

many times during your life you'll

look at your reflection in the mirror

and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've

all done it. I'm not going through a

lapse. What I've experienced is closer

to awakening. I'm not trying to shake

your faith. I've just decided not to

devote my life to God anymore.

KATE

What do you think Mom would say?

JACOB

Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

CUT TO:

TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)

Hold your horses!

OLD-TIMER

(rough)

Whatcha want?

SETH

Whatcha think I want, ya mean old

bastard? I wanna room.

RICHARD

Do they have cable?

SETH

No.

RICHARD

Do they have an X-rated channel?

SETH

No.

RICHARD

Do they have a waterbed?

SETH

They don't have anything except four

walls and a roof, and that's all we

need.

SETH

(tossing Richie the motel keys)

Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

up in the trunk.

SETH

Don't say a word.

SETH

You. Plant yourself in that chair.

HOSTAGE

What are you planning on doing with --

SETH

-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't

talk. You wanna get on my good side?

Just sit still and don't make a peep.

SETH

Let me help you.

SETH

How's it feel?

RICHARD

How ya think, it hurts like a

son-of-a-bitch.

SETH

I got both rooms on either side of us,

so we don't gotta worry about

eavesdropping assholes. How's that

feel? You okay?

RICHARD

Feels good.

SETH

I'm gonna go get the money.

SETH

It's about five o'clock.

(to hostage)

What time does it get dark around

here?

HOSTAGE

About seven.

SETH

Good. I'm going towards the border to

check things out while it's still

daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the

rendezvous.

RICHARD

Hey, when you talk to him, see if you

can arrange a better deal than thirty

percent.

SETH

That's their standard deal, brother.

They ain't about to change it for us.

RICHARD

Did you even to try to negotiate?

SETH

These guys ain't spic fire cracker

salesman from Tijuana. They don't even

know the meaning of the word "barter".

You wanna stay in El Ray? You give

them thirty percent of your loot. It's

scripture. So it is written, so shall

it be done. You want sanctuary, you

pay the price, and the price is thirty

percent.

RICHARD

All I'm saying --

SETH

-- This conversation is over.

SETH

Now, we need to have a talk. What's

your name?

HOSTAGE

Gloria.

SETH

Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my

brother Richie. Let's cut to the

chase. I'm gonna ask you a question

and all I want is a yes or no answer.

Do you want to live through this?

GLORIA

Yes.

SETH

Good. Then let me explain the house

rules. Follow the rules, we'll get

along like a house on fire. Rule number

one: No noise, no question. You make a

noise...

(he holds up his .45)

...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a

question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are

you absolutely, positively clear about

rule number one?

GLORIA

Yes.

SETH

Rule number two: You do what we say,

when we say it. If you don't, see rule

number one.

SETH

Rule number three: Don't you ever try

and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got

five little friends, and they all run

faster 'n you can. Got it?

SETH

Open your eyes.

SETH

Gloria, you hang in there, follow the

rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll

get out of this alive. I give you my

word. Okay?

SETH

I'll be back in a bit.

RICHARD

Wanna come up here on the bed and

watch TV with me?

RICHARD

Come on.

SETH

Things are real hot here. Crossing's

gonna be a bitch.

(pause)

Don't worry, we'll get across. But

when we do, where do we go?

(pause)

Can we make it as close to the border

as possible? Texas wants our balls.

The quicker we're in your protection,

the better I'll feel.

(pause)

Okay, where?

(pause)

The Titty Twister?

(he laughs)

I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll

see you and your men at the "Titty

Twister" tomorrow morning.

(pause)

Bye, my friend.

EL PASO

5 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE

(talking to camera)

This bloody crime spree started just a

week ago today. The oldest of the two

brothers...

KELLY HOUGE (V.O)

...Seth Gecko was serving time in

Rolling's Kansas State Penitentiary

for his part in the 1988 Scott City

bank robbery in which two law

enforcement officers lost their lives.

KELLY HOUGE

Having served eight years of his

twenty-two year sentence, Seth Gecko

was brought to Wichita Municipal court

house for his first parole hearing. It

was while at the court house that this

man...

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

... his younger brother Richard Gecko,

a known armed robber and sex offender,

pulled off a daring daylight escape...

KELLY HOUGE

...resulting in the death of four

Wichita law enforcement officers, and

this woman...

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

...Heide Vogel, sixth grade teacher

who was run over by the Geckos during

a high speed pursuit through downtown

Wichita.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

From there the brothers traveled

from Kansas through Oklahoma...

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

...into the great state of Texas, and

then finally...

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

...into Abilene.

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE

The list of the dead climbed up three

more notches since our last telecast.

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

Officer Sherman Goodell, who was in

intensive care following the gun

battle outside of the Valley Federal

bank building...

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE

...died about forty-five minutes ago

at Hopkins General hospital. And about

six hours ago, during a daylight

liquor store robbery in Big Springs,

The Gecko Brothers killed another

Texas Ranger...

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

...Earl McGraw...

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

...and liquor store clerk Pet

Bottoms.

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

Then they proceeded to burn the store

down to the ground.

KELLY HOUGE

That changes the death toll to fifteen.

(It changes under "Death toll")

Five Texas Rangers...

(it changes)

Eight police officers

(it changes)

Three civilians.

(it changes)

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE

And one hostage...

CUT TO:

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

... bank teller and mother of four,

Gloria Hill.

KELLY HOUGE

Heading the case to bring these

fugitives to justice is FBI agent

Stanley Chase. We talked with agent

Chase earlier this afternoon.

CUT TO:

STANLEY CHASE

For the time being we are very

confident we will apprehend the

fugitives in the next forty-eight

hours. The Bureau, local law

enforcement and the Texas Rangers

have all joined forces in forming a

dragnet to snare Seth and Richard

Gecko.

KELLY HOUGE

Agent Chase, does it appear that they

are heading for Mexico.

STANLEY CHASE

Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already

alerted the Mexican authorities. They

intend to cooperate every way possible

in bringing these fugitives to

justice.

KELLY HOUGE

Are you optimistic about the safety of

the hostage they took in Abilene,

Gloria Hill?

STANLEY CHASE

We've received no news one way or the

other. We can only hope for the best.

KELLY HOUGE

What about the report from an

eyewitness at the liquor store who

said one of the brothers was shot?

STANLEY CHASE

This can't be confirmed at this time,

but we do believe it to be true. We

have reason to believe it was the

youngest brother Richard, and he was

shot in the vicinity of his neck and

shoulders by the store's clerk.

KELLY HOUGE

Is it safe to assume that because the

death count involved and the loss of

life of law enforcement officers, that

the Bureau, the Rangers and the police

force are taking this manhunt

personally?

STANLEY CHASE

I would say that's a very safe

assumption.

CUT TO:

RICHARD

(Newscaster's voice)

Is it safe to assume since the law

enforcement authorities in the great

state of Texas are homosexuals of a

sick and deviate nature, that they

will be too busy fucking each other

up the ass to actually catch The

Gecko Brothers?

(in an FBI voice)

I would say that's a very safe

assumption.

CASPER

Would you play with me?

COP

Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

RICHARD

Shit, I started to get worried. Where

the fuck ya been?

SETH

Sight seein'.

RICHARD

What'd ya see?

SETH

Cops.

RICHARD

Didya look at the border?

SETH

Yeah, I saw the border. Through

binoculars from on top of a high

building. That's about as close as I

risked getting. What's the TV say?

RICHARD

They're going to apprehend us in

forty-eight hours.

SETH

(to himself)

I gotta figure a way to get across

that goddamn border. Longer we fuck

around El Paso our lives ain't worth

a shit.

RICHARD

Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig

in and wait for things to cool down.

SETH

Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'

worse before it gets any fuckin'

better. We showed our ass in Texas. We

killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They

ain't gonna stop lookin' till they

find us, and when they find us,

they're gonna kill us. Texans take it

very personal when ya kill their law

enforcement officers. The El Paso

police have already started a motel

and hotel search for us.

RICHARD

How do you know?

SETH

I heard it on the radio. We gotta get

our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos

is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a

rendezvous on the other side, then

Carlos and his boys will escort us to

El Ray and --

SETH

Where's the woman?

RICHARD

What?

SETH

What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'

woman, the hostage. Where the fuck

is she, Richard!?

RICHARD

She's in the other room.

SETH

What the fuck is she doin' there?!

RICHARD

Seth, before you open the door, let

me explain what happened.

SETH

(to himself)

Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

RICHARD

Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me

just explain what happened.

SETH

Yeah, explain it to me. I need an

explanation. What's the matter with

you?

RICHARD

(low and calm)

There's nothing wrong with me,

brother. That woman tried to escape

and I did what I had to do.

SETH

No.

(pause)

That woman wouldn't of said shit if

she had a mouthful.

RICHARD

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,

wrong, wrong! Once you left, she

became a whole different person.

SETH

(slowly approaching)

Is it me? Is it my fault?

RICHARD

It's not your fault, it's her fault!

SETH

Is this my fault? Do you think this

is what I am?

RICHARD

What?

SETH

This is not me! I am a professional

fucking thief. I steal money. You try

to stop me, god help you. But I don't

kill people I don't have to, and I

don't rape women. What you doin' ain't

how it's done. Do you understand?

RICHARD

Seth, if you were me --

SETH

Just say yes! Nothing else, just say

yes.

RICHARD

Yes.

SETH

Yes, Seth, I understand.

RICHARD

Yes, Seth, I understand.

SETH

(whispers in Richie's ear)

We get into Mexico, it's gonna be

sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,

and rice and beans. None of this

shit's gonna matter.

KATE

I can't believe he's stopping here.

This place looks totally cruddy.

KATE

Dad, why are we stopping here?

JACOB

There's nothing wrong with this

place.

KATE

It's a flop house.

JACOB

It's not a flop house. It's basic

and simple. That doesn't make it a

flop house.

KATE

If it doesn't have a pool, we're

looking for a new place.

JACOB

It has a bed. That's all I care about.

KATE

Other places have beds, they also have

cable TV, a gym, room service...

KATE

Owww, my head.

JACOB

Watch where you're going!

SCOTT

What's this guy's problem?

JACOB

I have no idea.

JACOB

Anytime, man.

KATE

Creepy guy.

JACOB

(yelling)

What?

VOICE (O.S.)

I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to

disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

JACOB

I hope none of this is disturbing you.

RICHARD

Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is

Don Cornelius. No, not the Don

Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my

lady friend need some ice and we don't

seem to have an ice bucket. Could we

possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it

right back.

JACOB

(still partially asleep)

Sure.

JACOB

What is this?

SETH

It's called a punch.

RICHARD

Sit down.

RICHARD

Good boy.

SETH

(to Jacob)

What's your name?

JACOB

Jacob.

SETH

Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass

down on the bed. Make a wrong move and

I'll shoot you in the face.

SETH

(to Richard)

Okay, move the Jap over there.

RICHARD

Upsy daisy.

SETH

(to his hostages)

What's the story with you two? You a

couple of fags?

JACOB

He's my son.

SETH

How does that happen? You don't look

Japanese.

JACOB

Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

SETH

Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

JACOB

What's this about, money?

SETH

It's about money, all right, but not

yours. You see, me and my brother here

are in a little hot water and we need

your assistance.

SETH

(to Scott and Jacob)

Stop!

KATE

What's going on?

RICHARD

We're having a wet bikini contest,

and you just won.

JACOB

(to Kate)

It's okay, honey. Everything's going

to be all right.

SETH

Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't

do nothin' stupid.

(he turns to Jacob and Scott,

who are still standing)

You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

SETH

(to Jacob)

Where are the keys to the motor home?

JACOB

On the dresser.

SETH

Richie, take the keys. Start that big

bastard up, and drive it up front.

KATE

Richie, will you do me a favor and eat

my pussy?

RICHARD

Sure.

SETH (O.S.)

Richard!

SETH

Not when you get around to it, now.

SETH

(pointing at Kate)

You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and

put on some clothes.

SETH

You got three minutes. One second

longer, I shoot your father in the

face. Do you understand what I just

said?

KATE

Yes.

SETH

Do you believe me?

KATE

Yes.

SETH

You damn well better. Go.

JACOB

Look, if you want the motor home, just

take it and get out.

SETH

Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that

easy.

SETH

Get ready to move out, we're all going

on a little ride.

JACOB

Not a chance.

SETH

Come again?

JACOB

If you're taking people, take me. But

my kids aren't going anywhere with

you.

SETH

Sorry, I need everybody.

JACOB

My children are not going with you,

and that's that.

SETH

(angry)

That's not fuckin' that...

(holds up his gun)

this is fuckin' this.

(he calms down and looks

at Scott)

Go sit over there.

SETH

I ain't got time to fuck around with

you, so I'll make this simple. Take

your kids and get in the car, or I'll

execute all three of you right now.

(he cocks the gun and puts

it right in Jacob's face)

What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

JACOB

Yes.

SETH

Good.

(to Scott)

Your old man's all right, he just

saved your life.

SETH

Times up, Princess.

SETH

Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

CUT TO:

KATE

Excuse me.

RICHARD

What?

KATE

Where are you taking us?

RICHARD

Mexico.

KATE

What's in Mexico?

RICHARD

Mexicans.

SETH

(reading his driver's license)

Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,

ain't it? What am I askin' for, of

course it is.

(motioning behind him)

What are their names?

JACOB

Scott and Kate.

SETH

Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...

Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

SETH

Who's this?

JACOB

My wife.

SETH

Where is the little lady?

JACOB

In heaven.

SETH

She's dead?

JACOB

Yes, she is.

SETH

How'd she die?

JACOB

Auto wreck.

SETH

Come on, gimme some more details.

How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk

kill her?

JACOB

No. It was a rainy night, the brakes

on the car weren't great. She had to

stop suddenly. She slid on the road,

she crashed, she died.

SETH

Died instantly?

JACOB

Not quite. She was trapped in the

wreck for about six hours before she

passed on.

SETH

Whewww! Those acts of God really stick

it in and break it off, don't they?

JACOB

Yes, they do.

SETH

Is this real?

JACOB

Yes.

SETH

I've seen one of these before. A

friend of mine had himself declared

a minister of his own religion. Away

to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're

doing, or are you the real McCoy?

JACOB

Real McCoy.

SETH

You're a preacher?

JACOB

I was a minister.

SETH

Was? As in not anymore?

JACOB

Yes.

SETH

Why'd ya quit?

JACOB

I think I've gotten about as up close

and personal with you as I'm gonna

get. Now if you need me like I think

you need me, you're not gonna kill me

'cause I won't answer your stupid,

prying questions. So, with all due

respect, mind your own business.

SETH

I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't

be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this

friendly. But you're right, enough

with the getting to know you shit.

Now, there's two ways we can play this

hand. One way is me and you go round

an' round all fuckin' night. The other

way, is we reach some sort of an

understanding. Now, if we go down that

first path at the end of the day, I'll

win. But we go down the second, we'll

both win. Now, I don't give a rat's

ass about you or your fuckin' family.

Y'all can live forever or die this

second and I don't care which. The

only things I do care about are me

that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and

our money. And right now I need to get

those three things into Mexico. Now,

stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it

you don't give a shit about seeing me

and my brother receiving justice, or

the bank getting its money back. Right

now all you care about is the safety

of your daughter, your son and

possibly yourself. Am I correct?

JACOB

Yes.

SETH

I thought so. You help us get across

the border without incident, stay with

us the rest of the night without

trying anything funny, and in the

morning we'll let you and your family

go. That way everybody gets what they

want. You and your kids get out of

this alive and we get into Mexico.

Everybody's happy.

JACOB

How do I know you'll keep your word?

SETH

Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with

this shit.

JACOB

You want me to sit here and be

passive. The only way being passive in

this situation makes sense is if I

believe you'll let us go. I'm not

there yet. You have to convince me

you're telling the truth.

SETH

Look, dickhead, the only thing you

need to be convinced about is that

you're stuck in a situation with a

coupla real mean motor scooters. I

don't wanna hafta worry about you all

fuckin' night. And I don't think you

wanna be worrying about my brother's

intentions toward your daughter all

night. You notice the way he looked

at her, didn't ya?

JACOB

Yes.

SETH

Didn't like it, did ya?

JACOB

No, I didn't.

SETH

Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,

I'm willing to make a deal. You

behave, get us into Mexico, and don't

try to escape. I'll keep my brother

off your daughter and let you all

loose in the morning.

JACOB

You won't let him touch her?

SETH

I can handle Richie, don't worry.

SETH

I give you my word.

SETH

(hand sticks out)

My words, my law. Better you not take

it, and that's just where we are,

then take it and not mean it.

JACOB

If he touches her, I'll kill him. I

don't give a fuck how many guns you

have, nothing will stop me from

killing him.

SETH

Fair enough. You break your word, I'll

kill all of you.

(calling to the back)

Kate, honey!

KATE

Yeah.

SETH

You must have a bible in here, don't

cha?

KATE

Yeah, we got a bible.

SETH

Get it and bring it up here, will

ya, please?

SETH

Hold it right there, sweetie pie.

(to Jacob)

Put your hand on it.

SETH

Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't

try to escape and you'll get us across

the border.

JACOB

I swear to God I won't try to escape

and I'll do my best to get you into

Mexico.

SETH

You best better get it done, Pops.

SETH

I swear to God I'll let you loose in the

morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I

also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,

I'll slit all your throats.

TIME CUT TO:

RICHARD

Did ya mean what you said back there?

KATE

What?

RICHARD

In the room. Were you serious, or were

you just foolin' around? I'm just

bringing it up, 'cause if you really

want me to do that for you, I will.

KATE

Do what?

RICHARD

(in a whisper)

What you said to me in the room.

KATE

(whispers back)

What did I say?

RICHARD

(whisper)

You asked me if I would --

SETH (O.S.)

Richard!

RICHARD

(to Seth)

What?

SETH

I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say

talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say

to one another. So cut the chatter.

RICHARD

(quiet)

We'll talk later.

CUT TO:

SETH

Okay everybody, it's show time.

Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

SETH

Scott, you come up front with your

daddy.

JACOB

I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

SETH

As long as you're cool, she'll be

cool. What're ya gonna say?

JACOB

I don't have the slightest idea.

SETH

Well, you just keep thinkin' of that

gun next to Kate's temple.

SCOTT

What are you gonna do?

JACOB

I'm gonna try and get us across the

border.

SCOTT

No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that

they're back there.

RICHARD

This isn't gonna work.

SETH

Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

RICHARD

I just want to go on record as saying

this is a bad idea.

SETH

Duly noted. Now, shut up.

RICHARD

(to himself)

They're gonna search the van.

SETH

(offhand)

As long as you don't act like a

fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

RICHARD

What does that mean?

SETH

(distracted)

What?

RICHARD

You just called me a fuckin' nut.

SETH

No, I didn't.

RICHARD

Yes, you did. You said as long as I

don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying

that I've been acting like a fuckin'

nut.

SETH

Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay

cool.

RICHARD

You meant that, but you meant the

other, too.

SETH

(serious as a heart attack)

This ain't the time, Richard.

RICHARD

(his voice rising)

Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a

fuckin' nut, and where I come from,

that stops the train on its tracks.

SETH

(real quiet and violent)

Keep your voice down.

RICHARD

(quiet back)

Or what?

JACOB

Have you forgotten about your sister?

SCOTT

They're gonna kill us. They get us

across the border, they're gonna take

us out in the desert and shoot us.

JACOB

If they get over the border, they're

gonna let us go.

SCOTT

Dad, I watch those reality shows.

They never let anybody go. Any cop

will tell you, in a situation like

this, you get a chance, you go for it.

This is our chance.

JACOB

What about Kate?

SCOTT

They're gonna kill her anyway. At

least now with all these cops we've

got a fighting chance.

JACOB

Son, I have this situation under

control. I know exactly what I'm

doing. You're going to have to trust

me on this.

SCOTT

If trusting you means trusting those

fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If

you don't tell the cops, I will.

JACOB

Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna

do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear

me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm

running this show, I make the

decisions.

SCOTT

He's running the show.

JACOB

I'm running the show. I make the

plays, and you back the plays I

make. Stop thinking with your fucking

balls. Kate in a room with a couple of

desperate men with nothing to fucking

lose ain't the time to "go for it."

I need your cover. Cover my ass.

BORDER GUARD

How many with you?

JACOB

Just my son and I.

BORDER GUARD

What is your purpose in Mexico?

JACOB

Vacation. I'm taking him to see his

first bullfight.

RICHARD

I'm curious. What was the nuttiest

thing I did?

SETH

This ain't the time.

RICHARD

Oh, I know, was it possibly when your

ass was rotting in jail and I broke it

out? Yeah, you're right, that was

pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention

stupid. But you know what? I can fix

that right now.

BORDER GUARD

What was that?

JACOB

Oh, that's just my daughter in the

bathroom.

BORDER GUARD

You said it was just you and your son.

JACOB

I meant me, my son and my daughter.

BORDER GUARD

Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

KATE

I'm in the bathroom.

BORDER GUARD (O.S.)

It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

KATE

It's open.

KATE

Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

BORDER GUARD

Excuse me.

CUT TO:

SCOTT

It's clear.

SETH

Goddamn, that was. intense!

SETH

(to himself)

We did it.

(pause)

We're in Mexico.

SETH

(loud and happy)

Come here, Kate!

SETH

(to Kate)

You were magnificent! You told him to

shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in

the shower, and I'm thinking to

myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what

I just fuckin' heard? And what does he

do -- he shuts the fucking door!

SETH

If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd

fuckin' marry you!

SETH

I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you

raised a fuckin' woman.

JACOB

We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.

Now it's time for your part, letting

us go.

SETH

Pops, when you're right, you're right,

and you are right.

KATE

(suddenly brightens)

You're gonna let us go?

SETH

In the morning, darlin', in the

morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are

F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys

through hell, and I know I've been one

rough pecker, but from here on end you

guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help

me pick Richie up, and lay him down.

Jacob, keep going on this road till

you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."

When you get to Digayo, turn this big

bastard left, go on down for a few

miles, then you see a bar called "The

Titty Twister." From what I hear, you

can't miss it.

JACOB

Then?

SETH

Then stop, 'cause that's where we're

going.

CUT TO:

SETH (O.S.)

C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a

career out of it.

SETH

You okay?

RICHARD

(disoriented)

Yeah, I think so. What happened?

SETH

I don't know, you just passed out.

RICHARD

I did?

SETH

Yeah, we were just standing there. You

said something about your shoulder

hurting, then you just hit the ground

like a sack of potatoes.

RICHARD

Really?

SETH

Yeah, when you fell your head smacked

the toilet hard. It scared the shit

outta me. Sure you're okay?

RICHARD

Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little

fucked up.

SETH

Well, let me tell ya something, gonna

clear your head right up. We are

officially Mexicans.

RICHARD

What?

SETH

We are...

(singing)

"South of the border down Mexico way."

RICHARD

We are?

SETH

Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous

right now. We get there, we pound

booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts

us to El Ray. And then me and you,

brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya

like them apples?

RICHARD

Far out.

(pause)

Where are my glasses?

SETH

They broke when you fell.

RICHARD

Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

SETH

Don't worry about it, we'll get you

some glasses.

RICHARD

What dya mean, don't worry about it.

Of course I'm gonna worry about it,

I can't fuckin' see.

SETH

When we get to El Ray, I'll take care

of it.

RICHARD

Yeah, like a Mexican

hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my

fuckin' prescription.

SETH

It's not a big deal, unless you make

it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,

Richie, stop bringing me down with

bullshit.

JACOB

Guys! We're here.

CUT TO:

THE TITTY TWISTER

Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

CHET

Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must

go. At the Titty Twister we're

slashing pussy in half! This is a

pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our

vast selection of pussy! We got white

pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,

yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,

wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,

bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,

smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk

pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'

pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule

pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have

it, you don't want it!

SETH

(to the group)

Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.

Here's the deal; this place closes at

dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here

sometime before dawn. Which by my

guesstimate is somewhere between three

or four hours from now. So we're gonna

go in there, take a seat, have a drink

-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait

for Carlos. That could be an hour,

that could be three hours, I don't

know which. But when he gets here,

me and Richie are going to leave

with him. After we split, you guys

are officially out of this stewpot.

Let me just say I'm real happy about

where we're at. We got a real nice, "I

don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck

with me" attitude going on. Now, if

everybody just keeps playin' it cool

-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie

-- everybody's gonna get what they

want. Comprende, amigos?

SETH

Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.

I'm buyin'.

JACOB

Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

SETH

Shit, I been to bars make this place

look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

RICHARD

I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I

been to some fucked up places in my

time, but that place is fucked up.

SETH

(in a baby talk voice)

Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little

baby too afraid to go into the big

scary bar?

RICHARD

That's what you think?

SETH

That's how you're lookin', Richie.

RICHARD

I'm lookin' scared?

SETH

That's what you look like.

RICHARD

You know what you look like?

SETH

No, Richie, what do I look like?

RICHARD

You're lookin' green.

SETH

How?

RICHARD

Where are you right now?

SETH

What do you mean?

RICHARD

Where are you?

SETH

I'm here with you.

RICHARD

No, you're not. You're sippin'

margaritas in El Ray. But we're

not in El Ray. We're here --

getting ready to go in there.

You're so pleased with yourself

about getting into Mexico, you

think the job's down. It ain't.

Get back on the clock. That's a

fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around

there for a coupla hours, in all

likelihood, we'll get fucked with.

So get your shit together, brother.

SETH

My shit is together.

RICHARD

It don't look together.

SETH

Well, it is. Just because I'm happy

doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're

just not used to seein' me happy,

'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'

years since I been happy. But my shit

is forever together.

RICHARD

Okay, just checkin'.

CHET

(yelling into the microphone)

Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular

price, you get another piece of pussy,

of equal or lesser value, for a penny.

Now try and beat pussy for a penny!

If you can find cheaper pussy

anywhere, fuck it!

CHET

(in microphone, towards Kate)

What's this? A new flavor approaching.

Apple Pie Pussy.

SETH

Step aside, asshole.

CHET

Not so fast, Slick.

SETH

Now, is my shit together, or is my

shit together?

RICHARD

(slappin' Seth five)

Your shit is forever together!

SETH

Now this is my kinda place! I could

become a regular.

SETH

Whiskey!

RAZOR CHARLIE

(in English)

You can't come in here.

SETH

What dya mean?

RAZOR CHARLIE

This is a private club. You're not

welcome.

SETH

Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough

to drink here?

RAZOR CHARLIE

This bar is for bikers and truckers

only.

(points his finger to Seth)

You, get out!

BIG EMILIO

(to Seth in Spanish)

Walk, Pendaho.

SETH

(low)

Take your hand off me.

BIG EMILIO

(Spanish)

I'm going to count to three.

SETH

No, I'm going to count to three.

BIG EMILIO

Uno...

SETH

Two..

JACOB

Now wait a minute, there's no reason

to get ugly. There's just a

misunderstanding going on here. You

said this bar is for truckers and

bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

JACOB

If you look outside your door, parked

in your parking lot, you'll see a big

ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.

In order to drive that legally, you

need a class two driver's license.

That is the same license that the

DMV requires truck drivers to carry

in order to drive a truck.

(he takes the license out

of his wallet and lays it

on the bar)

That is me, and this is my class two

license. This is a truck driver's bar,

I am a truck driver, and these are

my friends.

RAZOR CHARLIE

(to Jacob)

Welcome to the Titty Twister. What

can I get you?

SETH

Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

RAZOR CHARLIE

Coming right up.

RICHARD

Good job, Pops.

SETH

That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest

number one problem with Mexico, it's

not service oriented. I was feelin'

so good, and those fuckin' spies

brought me down.

RICHARD

Fuck 'em, shake it off.

SETH

You serve food, Jose?

RAZOR CHARLIE

Best in Mexico.

SETH

I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a

table, send over a waitress to take

our order.

RICHARD

Anytime you want a lap dance with that

broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

RAZOR CHARLIE

(in Spanish)

They're not the normal road trash we

normally feed on. But it'll be okay.

No one knows they're here.

SETH

Who else?

JACOB

Pass.

SETH

(picking a fight)

Why not, against your religion?

JACOB

(won't be baited)

No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking

now.

SETH

Suit yourself, more for me.

(to Scott)

Scotty?

SETH

(to Kate)

How 'bout you?

(pointing at Scott and Kate)

are safer in here with us than

wandering around a Mexican border town

all night long. Just don't do nothin'

stupid and we'll all get along fine.

(to Scott)

Scotty, you sure you don't want a

drink?

SCOTT

Okay, I'll have one.

JACOB

No you won't.

SETH

Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I

don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms

up, boy.

SETH

How about you, cutie pie? Ready for

round two?

KATE

Okay.

RICHARD

(to Seth)

Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you

just created a monster.

JACOB

Why are you so agitated?

SETH

I'm still stewing about that ape

laying hands on me. And that fuckin'

bartender sticks a weed up my ass,

too.

JACOB

He backed down.

SETH

He's smilin' at us. But behind his

smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."

I hear that loud and clear.

JACOB

What are you going to do?

SETH

(picking up the whiskey bottle)

I'm gonna just sit here and drain

this bottle. And when I've drunk the

last drop, if I still feel then, the

way I feel now, I'm gonna take this

bottle and break it over his melon

head.

JACOB

Before we stepped in here, you told

all of us to be cool. That means you,

too.

SETH

(tossing it off)

I never said do what I do, I said do

what I say.

JACOB

Are you so much a fucking loser, you

can't tell when you've won?

SETH

What did you call me?

JACOB

Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I

asked a question. Would you like me to

ask it again? Very well. Are you such

a loser you can't tell when you've

won?

(pause)

The entire state of Texas, along with

the FBI, is looking for you. Did they

find you? No. They couldn't. They had

every entrance to the border covered.

There's no way you could get across.

Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,

Seth, enjoy it.

SETH

Jacob, I want you to have a drink with

me. I insist.

SETH

To your family.

JACOB

To yours.

JACOB

Now, is your shit together?

SETH

Forever together.

SETH

In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take

it that's yours.

SCOTT

Yeah, it's mine.

SETH

Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

CUT TO:

RAZOR CHARLIE

(announcer voice in Spanish)

And now for your viewing pleasure. The

Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome

of Evil. The most sinister woman to

dance on the face of the earth. Lowly

dogs, get on your knees, bow your

heads and worship at the feet of

SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

SANTANICO

(to Richard in Spanish)

Drink up.

SETH

Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what

I call a fuckin' show!

SETH

(snapping his fingers)

Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask

your new friend to join us?

RICHARD

Yeah.

SETH

Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

RICHARD

(looking up at Santanico)

Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to

join us?

SANTANICO

(to Richard)

Muy bien, gracias.

SETH

Richie, you lucky bastard!

(to Santanico)

Now, little lady, you could of just as

easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!

You got my dick harder 'n Chinese

arithmetic.

SETH

Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red

Riding Hood is walking through the

forest and she comes across Little Bo

Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:

"Little Red Riding Hood, are you

crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf

is walking these woods and if he finds

you he's gonna pull down your dress

and squeeze your titties?" Then Little

Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt

and taps a .357 Magnum she has

holstered on her thigh and says: "No

he won't."

JACOB

(to himself)

Oh, shit.

(to Seth)

Seth --

SETH

Not now. So finally she comes across

the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad

Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red

Riding Hood, you know better than to

be walking around these woods alone.

You know I'm just gonna have to pull

down your dress and squeeze your

titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood

whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks

it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and

says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat

me, just like the story says."

RAZOR CHARLIE

(to Chet in Spanish)

Which one?

CHET

(pointing at Seth)

This piece of shit broke my finger

and my nose...

(pointing at Richard)

then this fag kicked me in the ribs

while I was down.

BIG EMILIO

(to The Gecko Brothers)

Up!

RICHARD

Fuck off, ape man!

RICHARD

How are you?

SETH

Scarred for life, that's how I am!

SETH

You thought it was pretty funny,

didn't you?

SETH

Everybody be cool, or you'll be just

as dead as these fucks!

KATE

(yelling)

Richie, look out!

RICHARD

Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

RICHARD

(with his dying breath)

Fucking Bitch!

SETH

Richie.

WHORE

Dinner is served!

SANTANICO

Let's see if you taste as good as your

brother.

SANTANICO

I'm not gonna drain you completely.

You're gonna turn for me, You'll be

my slave. You'll live for me. You'll

eat bugs because I order it. Because

I don't think you're worthy of human

blood, you'll feed on the blood of

stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.

And at my command, you'll lick the dog

shit from my boot heel. Since you'll

be my dog, your new name will be

"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

end over end.

BIG EMILIO

Noooooo!

SETH

We may be in trouble.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, you, monkey man!

SEX MACHINE

Anything you gotta say to them, say

to me first.

SEX MACHINE

That's enough.

CHET

You know what everybody says about me?

I suck!

CHET

I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

CHET

Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the

pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

FROST

Ain't they supposed to burn up or

something?

SETH

Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.

You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd

find peace there. I love you little

brother, I'll miss ya bad.

RICHARD

I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I

love you, too.

SETH

Touch my brother with that stake,

biker, and vampires won't need to

suck your blood, they'll be able to

lick it up off the floor.

SEX MACHINE

He ain't your brother no more.

SETH

That's a matter of opinion, and I

don't give a fuck about your's.

JACOB

Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

SETH

Shut up!

RICHARD

Yeah, shut up.

SETH

Hold him down.

SETH

Richie, here's the peace in death I

could never give you in life.

KATE

Are you okay?

SETH

Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The

world's my oyster, except for the

fact that I just rammed a wooden

stake in my brother's heart because

he turned into a vampire, even

though I don't believe in vampires.

Aside from that unfortunate business,

everything's hunky-dory.

KATE

I'm really sorry.

SETH

Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half

a chance you'd feed us to them!

JACOB

Then why didn't I?

JACOB

I saved your life. I didn't have to,

but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your

brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm

sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're

gonna get out of this we need each

other. And we need you sober and

thinking, not drunk and...

JACOB

What the hell is that?

FROST

At first I just thought it was birds.

SEX MACHINE

No, it's more of a gnawing sound.

Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats

gnaw.

SETH

It's bats.

JACOB

Give me a hand!

SEX MACHINE

Watch out, girly!

SEX MACHINE

(mumbling to himself)

Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

SEX MACHINE

Fire!

FROST

(to Sex Machine)

We'll put this out. You stake the rest

of these fuckers.

SEX MACHINE

Way ahead of ya.

(to Kate)

What's your name, girly?

KATE

Kate, what's yours?

SEX MACHINE

Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.

Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker

fuckers.

SCOTT

(yelling)

We got a problem!

SETH

Get this bastard off of me!

JACOB

Is everybody okay?

JACOB

Okay, does anybody here know what's

going on?

SETH

Yeah, I know what's going on. We got

a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside

trying to get inside and suck our

fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and

simple. And I don't wanna hear any

bullshit about "I don't believe in

vampires" because I don't fuckin'

believe in vampires either. But I do

believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,

and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'

vampires! Now, does everybody agree

we're dealin' with vampires.

SETH

You too, preacher?

JACOB

I'm like you. I don't believe in

vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

SETH

Good for you. Now, since we all

believe we're dealing with vampires,

what do we know about vampires?

Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a

cross?

JACOB

In the Winnebago.

SETH

In other words, no.

SCOTT

What are you talking about? We got

crosses all over the place. All you

gotta do is put two sticks together

and you got a cross.

SEX MACHINE

He's right. Peter Cushing does that

all the time.

SETH

I don't know about that. In order for

it to have any power, I think it's

gotta be an official crucifix.

JACOB

What's an official cross? Some piece

of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that

official? If a cross works against

vampires, it's not the cross itself,

it's what the cross represents. The

cross is a symbol of holiness.

SETH

Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses

covered, moving right along, what

else?

FROST

Wooden stakes in the heart been

workin' pretty good so far.

SEX MACHINE

Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I

forget, does silver do anything to a

vampire?

SCOTT

That's werewolves.

SEX MACHINE

I know silver bullets are werewolves.

But I'm pretty sure silver has some

sort of effect on vampires.

KATE

Does anybody have any silver?

ALL

No.

KATE

Then who cares?

SCOTT

When's sunrise?

JACOB

About two hours from now.

KATE

So all we have to do is get by for a

few more hours and then we can walk

right out the front door.

SEX MACHINE

Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our

barricades, that door, those plastered

windows and these walls will last two

more hours with those bat fucks

fuckin' with 'em.

JACOB

Has anybody here read a real book

about vampires, or are we just

remembering what a movie said? I mean

a real book.

SEX MACHINE

You mean like a Time-Life book?

FROST

(in a cowboy voice)

John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once

shot a man for snorin'.

JACOB

I take it the answer's no. Okay then,

what do we know about these vampires?

SETH

Aside from they're thirsty.

FROST

Well, one thing, they might got super

human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

JACOB

Yeah, that bottle upside the head of

Santanico didn't kill her, but it

didn't feel too good either.

SEX MACHINE

Another thing, you try and ram a

broken chair leg in a human, you

better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.

The human body is one rough-tough

machine. But these vamps got soft

bodies. The texture of their skin is

softer, mushier. You can push shit

right through 'em. Conceivably, if

you hit one hard enough, you could

take their fuckin' head off.

SCOTT

You could take their head off.

SETH

Actually, our best weapon against

these satanic cocksuckers is this man.

(he points at Jacob)

He's a preacher.

SETH

As far as God's concerned, we might

just as well be a piece of fuckin'

shit. But he's one of the boys. Only

one problem, his faith ain't what it

used to be.

JACOB

I've had enough of your taunts.

SETH

I'm not taunting you. We need you. A

faithless preacher doesn't mean shit

to us. But a man who's a servant of

God can grab a cross, shove it in

these monsters' asses. A servant of

God can bless the tap water and turn

it into a weapon.

SETH

I know why you lost your faith. How

could true holiness exist if your wife

can be taken away from you and your

children? Now, I always said God can

kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed

my lifetime tune about thirty minutes

ago' cause I know, without a doubt,

what's out there trying to get in

here is pure evil straight from hell.

And if there is a hell, and those

monsters are from it, there's got to

be a heaven. Now which are you, a

faithless preacher or a mean,

mother fuckin' servant of God?

JACOB

I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of

God.

KATE

I don't know if I can take two hours

of that noise.

FROST

You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got

no choice. How'd ya like twenty four

hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch

with only the rotting corpses of your

friends to keep you company?

JACOB

What are you talking about?

FROST

Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped

behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole

with my entire squad dead. They

thought they killed everybody, and

except for me, they were right. But it

wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade

blew up right next to me, that's why

I'm so pretty.

MALE VOICE (V.O.)

Thirst.

FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)

Thirst.

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)

Stop fucking saying that!

TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)

Thirst!

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)

That bite weren't nothin'. It just

hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's

all. It barely punched the skin.

VOICES (V.O.)

Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

FROST

...and then when I came back to my

senses, I realized I had killed the

entire V.C. squadron single handedly.

My bayonet had blood and chunks of

yellow flesh on it like some cannibal

shish kabob. And to this day I don't

have the slightest idea how I --

SEX MACHINE

THIRST!

FROST

I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

FROST

(to Sex Machine)

You're dead, mother fucker! You're

gonna bite me! You just turned me

into a vampire, asshole!

SEX MACHINE

What are you gonna do about it?

SETH

Oh shit!

JACOB

Good lord!

SETH

You wanna suck something, suck on

this!

KATE

We have to go back for Daddy!

SETH

Daddy's dead.

KATE

Noooo!

SCOTT

He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was

too far away. If flinging that door

and filling this room with those

bat-things would save him, I'd fling

it. The only thing it'll do is turn us

into one of them.

SETH

He needs our help!

SCOTT

He's beyond our help. You saw him get

bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.

You can't help him. I've got no one

left to lose but you. I can't be alone

again. We're sticking together.

JACOB

Open the door.

SETH

Did he...?

JACOB

Yep.

SETH

Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'

vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!

Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

SETH

You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm

gonna fuckin' kill every last one of

you godless pieces of shit!

JACOB

(to Seth)

You bet your sweet ass you are, and

I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't

got much time.

KATE

You're gonna be okay, aren't you,

daddy?

JACOB

No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,

I'm already dead.

JACOB

(to his children)

Children, listen to me. I love you two

more than anybody. And I just want you

to know you've made me proud all your

lives. But never more so than tonight.

And I wish we could sit here and cry

till I pass on, but we can't. Because

I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to

turn into a monster. And when I do,

I'm going to be dangerous. But before

that happens, just know I love you.

(to Seth and the kids)

Now, I'd say in the next twenty or

thirty minutes our friends outside

will bust in this door. And I'll

probably turn into a vampire within

the hour. Now, you have two choices.

You can wait for me to turn, then deal

with me, then wait for them to burst

inside here and the three of you will

deal with them. Or, we can kick open

that door and the four of us can hit

'em with everything we have, and carve

a path right through 'em to front

entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,

we gotta go at 'em now. I confused

them, I scared them, I took them off

guard. But they're going to get

unconfused, they're going to get

unscared, they're going to get

together and they're going to hit that

door like a ton of bricks. And when

that moment arrives, we gotta be

ready.

JACOB

What's this stuff?

SETH

My guess is that this little dive's

been feeding on nomad road waifs like

bikers and truckers for a longtime.

This is probably some of the

shipments they stole off the trucks.

JACOB

Well, I say lets tear this place apart

for weapons. So when they burst

through that door, we'll make 'em wish

they never did.

SETH

I don't give a shit about living or

dying anymore. I just want to send as

many of these devils back to hell as

I can.

JACOB

Amen.

JACOB

Before we go any further, I need you

three to promise me something. I'll

fight with you to the bitter end,

but when I turn into one of them, I

won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a

lap dog of Satan. I want you three to

promise you'll take me down, no

different from the rest.

SETH

I promise.

JACOB

Kate, Scott?

KATE

I promise.

JACOB

Scott?

SCOTT

Yeah, I promise.

JACOB

Why don't I believe you?

(he picks up the .45)

I'm gonna ask you two again, then I

want you to swear to God that you'll

kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna

just kill myself right now. Now,

since you need me I think you better

swear. Kate, do you swear to God

that when I turn into one of the

undead, you'll kill me?

JACOB

Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm

only gonna count to five. One...two...

three... four...

KATE

Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

JACOB

Not good enough, swear to God.

KATE

I swear to God, our father, that when

you change into one of the undead, I

will kill you.

JACOB

Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even

less time, so I'm only giving you the

count of three. One...

SCOTT

You don't believe in suicide.

JACOB

It's not suicide if you're already

dead. Two...

SCOTT

Okay, I'll kill you when you change,

I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

JACOB

Thank you, son.

SETH

Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some

fuckin' vampires.

SETH

Kill 'em all!

SCOTT

(yelling)

Why did they block the door again?

JACOB

(yelling)

To keep the daylight out! This is

where they sleep! Get to the door!

KATE

Seth!

SETH

Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite

and feel all right!

KATE

(yelling)

I'm going for 'em!

JACOB

No!

KATE

Everybody goes home!

KATE

(screaming)

Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

KATE

(to Seth)

Watch my back!

SETH

Anytime.

SCOTT

I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's

name.

SETH

Fight now, cry later.

KATE

Oh my god.

KATE

You bastards!

SCOTT

Kill me, Kate!

SETH

How many bullets left, kid?

KATE

Not many.

SETH

Well, when you run out of weapons,

just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em

sing for their supper.

KATE

(to Seth)

Should I use the last bullets on us?

SETH

You use 'em on the first couple of

these parasites that try to bite you.

SETH

Shoot more holes!

VOICE (O.S.)

(in Spanish)

I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in

there?

SETH

(yelling)

Carlos!

(in Spanish)

Help us, bash the door. Bash the door

in!

CARLOS (O.S.)

(in Spanish)

Danny, Manny, knock down the door.

Hurry, hurry!

CARLOS

(to Seth)

What the fuck was going on in there?

CARLOS

(in Spanish)

Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

SETH

Why the fuck, outta all the god

forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you

have us rendezvous at that place?

CARLOS

I don't know, one place's as good as

another.

SETH

Have you ever been there before?

CARLOS

No, but I passed by it a couple of

times. It's out in the middle of

nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,

so there wouldn't be a lot of police.

And it's open from dusk till dawn.

You said meet you in the morning.

SETH

Well, because you picked that place

out of a hat, my brother's dead now.

And this girl's family's dead.

CARLOS

I'm sorry to hear that. What were

they, psychos?

SETH

Did they look like psychos? They

were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't

explode when sunlight hits 'em, I

don't care how crazy they are.

CARLOS

Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up

to you?

SETH

You can't, but fifteen percent instead

of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a

good start.

CARLOS

Twenty-eight.

SETH

Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's

dead and he's not coming back, and

it's all your fault. Twenty.

SETH AND CARLOS

(in Spanish)

Twenty-five.

CARLOS

You like the car?

SETH

I said new, this is an '90.

CARLOS

It's hardly been used at all. I got it

from a drug dealer who only drove it 5

times in as many years. Swear to God.

That's like new.

SETH

So do I just follow you?

CARLOS

Yeah, follow us.

SETH

So let's do it.

CARLOS

(to Danny and Manny)

Vamanos!

SETH

I'm sorry.

KATE

Me too.

SETH

See ya.

KATE

Later.

KATE (O.S.)

Seth.

KATE

You want some company?

SETH

Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But

I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

THE END
