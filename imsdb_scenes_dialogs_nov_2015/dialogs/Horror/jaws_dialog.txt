CUT TO:

TOM

Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

CHRISSIE

C'mon!

CHRISSIE

Tommy? Don't dunk me...

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Hayes Landing reports conditions

good, with stripers and jacks. The

Coast Guard has no storm warning

from Block Island to Cape Hatteras;

a light chop with freshening winds,

continued clear and mild... (etc.)

BRODY

How come the sun didn't used to shine

in here?

ELLEN

'cause when we bought the house it

was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the

dogs.

BRODY

Right.

ELLEN

Do you see the kids?

BRODY

Probably out in the back yard.

ELLEN

In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'

(she gives it the

Boston sound)

BRODY

The kids are in the yahd, playing

near the cah. How's that sound?

ELLEN

Like you're from N'Yawk.

(gives it Brooklyn

sound)

BRODY

Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

BRODY

Did you burn another kettle? Y'know

you're a fire hazard? This is the

third one!

ELLEN (O.S.)

I never hear the whistle.

BRODY

Feed the dogs.

ELLEN

You want to go through those?

(she indicates bag of

clothes)

I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.

It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.

Pick out what you want to keep --

it's mostly your city clothes.

BRODY

(looking through bag,

remembering)

I used to wear this to the Garden.

Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.

(he puts it all behind)

Ship it.

ELLEN

Don't be silly - You're going to

make summer better for them...

MICHAEL

Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.

BRODY

On the swing? I told you not to play

near there until I sanded it down.

(to Ellen)

See what your son did?

ELLEN

Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band-

aid.

ELLEN

Don't forget these.

BRODY

Oh, yeah.

(he puts them on)

How do I look? Older, huh?

ELLEN

I think they make you look sexy.

BRODY

Sexy, hm? What was I before?

ELLEN

Older, sillier.

BRODY

(as he goes to make

coffee, he fumbles

with the new glasses)

I don't want to depend on these

things, y'know - sometimes you can

weaken your eyes.

BRODY

Let's see...

BRODY

Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm...

Well, what do they usually do, float

or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll

meet both of you at the beach in

(checks watch)

...20 minutes, okay? Okay.

(hangs up)

First goddamn weekend of the summer.

ELLEN

There.

(to Brody)

What was that?

BRODY

(struggling to get

his shirt on over

his glasses)

The office.

ELLEN

Be careful.

BRODY

Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

BRODY

Love ya.

ELLEN

(kissing him back)

Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

BRODY

Christine what?

CASSIDY

Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one

ever died on me before.

BRODY

You picked her up on the ferry.

CASSIDY

I didn't know her.

BRODY

And nobody else saw her in the water?

CASSIDY

Somebody could've -- I was sort of

passed out.

BRODY

Think she might've run out on you?

CASSIDY

Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman

do that. I'm sure she drowned.

BRODY

You from around here?

CASSIDY

No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's

in Tuxedo, New York, though.

BRODY

You here for the summer?

CASSIDY

Some friends and me took a house.

BRODY

(genuinely curious)

What d'you pay for a place just for

the summer?

CASSIDY

A thousand apiece, something like

that. There's five of us. And we

each kick in a hundred a week for

beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

BRODY

Pretty stiff.

BRODY

Maybe that's your girl.

CASSIDY

(pathetically)

You can't make me look -- !

BRODY

If this is going to work, you've got

to keep current stuff out here, and

put 'closed' files in there. The

'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

POLLY

This is in no order of importance,

Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity

Town Council on Aging this Monday

night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire

Inspector wants you to go over the

fireworks site with him before he

catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly,

you have a batch of calls about that

new Karate school.

POLLY

Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale,

Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's

those nine-year-olds from the school

practicing karate on all those nice

picket fences.

POLLY

It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away

in the night?

BRODY

Jesus, Santos.

POLLY

What's the matter?

BRODY

Polly, I want to know what water

recreation is on for today.

POLLY

Right this minute?

BRODY

(To Hendricks)

Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'

signs?

HENDRICKS

We never had any. What's the problem?

LOCAL MERCHANT

Glad I caught you. There's a city

truck with New Hampshire plates parked

right in front of my...

KEISEL

(he stares at Brody's

face)

Wait-a-minute.

(stares some more)

Glasses, right?

KEISEL

Look at those fences! Little guys

about eight to ten years old. And

look at this!

KEISEL

They did that with their bare hands.

BRODY

Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

LYNWOOD

Stuff's no good to me in August when

the Pilgrims come in June...

(to Brody)

Go on and help yourself to whatever

you need, Chief. Can you work the

register?

HENDRICKS

Polly told me to tell you there's a

scout troop in Avril Bay doing the

mile swim for their Merit Badges. I

couldn't call them in, there's no

phone out there.

BRODY

(hands him the sign

material)

Get out of there  take these back

to the office and make up some 'Beach

Closed' signs, and let Polly do the

printing.

HENDRICKS

What's the matter with my printing?

VAUGHN

What have you got there, Lenny?

HENDRICKS

We had a shark attack at South Chop

this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta

batten down the beach.

VAUGHN

Who've you told this to, Lenny?

HENDRICKS

I just found out about it -- but

there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the

water a coupla miles down the coast

from where we found the girl. Avril

Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry

them off.

VAUGHN

(to Meadows)

Take my car, okay?

(to Hendricks)

You come with us, Lenny.

HENDRICKS

I've got all these signs here...

VAUGHN

C'mon, it'll give us time to think

about what they're going to say.

SCOUTMASTER

(bullhorn effect)

Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner.

Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts,

keep kicking...

(etc., ad lib)

VAUGHN

Martin!

(he catches up with

him)

Are you going to shut down the beach

on your own authority?

BRODY

Do I need any more authority?

MEADOWS

Technically, you need the instruction

of a civic ordinance, or a special

meeting of the town selectmen...

VAUGHN

(the good guy)

That's just going by the book. We're

just a little anxious that you're

rushing into something serious here.

This is your first summer.

BRODY

Now tell me something I don't know.

VAUGHN

All I'm saying is that Amity is a

summer town -- we need summer dollars,

and if they can't swim here, they'll

use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long

Island.

BRODY

So we should set out a smorgasbord?

MEADOWS

We're not even sure what it was.

BRODY

What else could've done that?

VAUGHN

(to Doctor)

Boat propeller?

DOCTOR

I think, possibly... sure. A boating

accident.

VAUGHN

Some weekend tramp accidentally goes

swimming too far, she's a little

drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

MEADOWS

Remember when Fred Ganz went

scalloping in his BVD's? He was going

to swim to New Bedford, he said.

MEADOWS

...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him

in his net...?

BRODY

(interrupting the

merriment)

Doctor, you're the one who told me

what it was!

DOCTOR

I was wrong. We'll have to amend the

report.

MEADOWS

We never had that kind of trouble

here.

VAUGHN

I don't think you can appreciate the

gut reaction people have to these

things.

BRODY

I was only reacting to what I was

told.

VAUGHN

(taking Brody aside)

It's all psychological, anyway. You

yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says

'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've

got a panic on our hands. I think we

all agree we don't need a panic this

close to the 4th of July.

BRODY

I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't

you make Hendricks Chief? His family's

been here since the Puritans -- half

this island are his cousins.

VAUGHN

Martin, we hired the best man we

could find.

VAUGHN

We need someone who isn't prejudiced

by old feuds or family ties, someone

who can referee things.

MEADOWS

You have our complete support.

VAUGHN

Now then. We've got a vandalism

problem we ought to talk about...

SHOPKEEPER

Hello, Mr. Quint.

QUINT

Four spools of Number 12 piano wire,

Okay? I ordered them.

SHOPKEEPER

(finding them under

the counter)

Yessir, right here. What do those

fish do, eat this stuff?

QUINT

They choke on it.

SHOPKEEPER

Bye now.

MAX TAFT

(an adult)

Looks like another big season. Gets

worse every year.

MRS. TAFT

And none of them from the Island.

Just a lot of bother.

BRODY

(to Taft)

What?

TAFT

Present company excepted, but off-

islanders are a pain in the butt.

Pardon my French.

ELLEN

What about this kid? What if he were

born here. That make him an islander?

TAFT

Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an

oven, it don't make them muffins.

SEAN

I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

MRS. KINTNER

Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you

think you're going?

ALEX

Water. Just once more, please?

MRS. KINTNER

Let me see your fingers --

MRS. KINTNER

They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes

more.

ELLEN

Do you want the boys to come in?

Honey, if you're worried...

BRODY

(to Keisel)

How's the water?

KEISEL

Too cold. I'm going in again Labor

Day. Hope we get this weather next

weekend.

ELLEN

You're very tight, y'know?

(digs in)

Right there.

BRODY

Ow.

(he sees something)

He's gotta be more careful in the

water...

DOG MAN

Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy!

(whistles)

He continues to ad lib calling his

dog, but there's no answer, no dog

in the water.

A KID (MATHEW)

Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!

TOURIST

Something in the water. Right there!

Didn't anyone see it?

WOMAN

There's blood in the water.

ELLEN

What is it...?

BRODY

Michael! Sean! Out of the water.

Everybody out of the water! Michael!

Get out!

MRS. KINTNER

Alex! Alex? Alex...!

BRODY

Look, I've got to talk to her. This

isn't a contest we want the whole

country entering.

MEADOWS

I agree. If she's going to advertise,

I wouldn't recommend out-of-town

papers. Amity people could take care

of this.

BRODY

I'm responsible for public safety

around here...

VAUGHN

Then go out tomorrow and make sure

no one gets hurt.

(addressing the crowd)

Everybody, could I have your

attention? Since this affects all of

us, I suggest we move into council

chambers, where there's more room...

VAUGHN

Well, here we all are; anyone have

any special questions?

DENHERDER

Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in

cash or check?

(laughter from all)

VAUGHN

That's private business between you

brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

(to Brody)

-- Chief --

BRODY

(stepping in)

I'd like to tell you what we're doing

so far. These are some of the steps

I've taken as Chief of Police...

MEADOWS

(leading the direction

of the discussion)

What's going on with the beaches,

Chief?

BRODY

I'll get to that in a minute. First,

I plan to start our seasonal summer

help early, and to use shark spotters

on beaches open to the sea. I'd like

cooperation from local fishermen,

and I've also contacted the

Oceanographic Institute over on the

mainland.

VAUGHN

(Interrupting -- sotto

voice to Brody)

No need to involve outsiders in our

business, Martin.

WOMAN

Are you going to close the beaches?

BRODY

Larry and I have also decided to

close the beaches for a short time.

VAUGHN

Only 24 hours!

BRODY

I didn't agree to that!

MRS. TAFT

That official business could take

all summer!

MR. KEISEL

Maybe it's better to close.

THOSE IN FAVOR

MR. WISEMAN

We should make sure

there is no danger.

MR. HASSETT

I didn't raise my kids to be some

fish's lunch!

THOSE OPPOSED

MRS. TAFT

The motel is all I own --

you pull the plug on this

town and I go down the

drain with it.

MR. POSNER

Nobody's seen a shark.

MR. POLK

We'll lose business, we

lose taxes, we lose our

shirts!

QUINT

(after taking a deep

breath)

You all know me. You know what I do

for a living. I'll go out and get

this bird for you. He's a bad one

and it's not like goin' down the

pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-

cods. This is a fish that can swallow

a man whole. A little shakin', a

little tenderizing and down ya' go.

(a look to Vaughn)

You gotta get this fellow and get

him quick. If you do, it'll bring a

lot of tourist business just to see

him and you've got your business

back on a paying basis.

(beat)

A shark of that size is no pleasure

and I value my neck at a hell of a

lot more'n 3,000 bucks.

(a deadly look)

I'll find him for three. But I'll

kill him for ten.

QUINT

(he rises up)

The bastard is costing you more'n

that every day. Do you wanna stay

alive and annee up the ten or play

it cheap and be on welfare next

winter.

(a final moment)

I'm gonna kill this thing... just a

matter of whether I do it now -- or

at the end of summer.

VAUGHN

Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the

Selectmen will take your offer under

advisement

ELLEN

Can you stand something to eat?

BRODY

Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

ELLEN

Mikey loves his birthday present.

BRODY

Where is he?

ELLEN

(with a slight laugh)

He's sitting in it.

ELLEN

Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty

with a double-knot.

BRODY

Son! -- Out of the water now!

MICHAEL

My boat's neat, dad!

BRODY

(turning to Ellen)

I want him out of the ocean.

ELLEN

It's three feet deep, Martin

BRODY

(angry now)

Michael! Come inside!

ELLEN

It's his birthday present, and you

closed the beach, Honey. I told him

not to go in the water after what

happened yesterday. I don't believe

he'll ever do it again.

BRODY

I told him not to go out until he

memorized the handbook and the safety

safety regulations, until he was

sure of himself...

ELLEN

You heard your father! Out right

now!

CUT TO:

DENHERDER

You wanna call it a night after here?

CHARLIE

It's only two-thirty. What, are you

tired?

DENHERDER

Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind

three nibbles back.

DENHERDER

(reaching into the

bag)

Leg of lamb this time?

CHARLIE

Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

DENHERDER

(a hyena laugh)

We're blowin' half the bounty on

bait --

DENHERDER

One more after this, then I'm going

home.

CHARLIE

Set?

CHARLIE

Tide's taking it right out.

DENHERDER

You do this all the time, right,

Charlie?

CHARLIE

Twenty years.

DENHERDER

I can't believe that people pay money

to go fishing. This is really dumb.

This isn't even relaxing... it's

just boring.

DENHERDER

Hey! What's this?

CHARLIE

Look at him take it!

DENHERDER

Do I set the goddam hook?

CHARLIE

Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

DENHERDER

CHARLIE! JUMP!

CHARLIE

Holy Jesus Christ!

DENHERDER

Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

HENDRICKS

...So then Denherder and Charlie sat

there trying to catch their breath,

and figuring out how to explain to

Charlie's wife what happened to her

freezer full of meat.

BRODY

That wasn't funny.

HENDRICKS

Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in

Field and Stream.

BRODY

Looks more like the readers of the

National Enquirer.

OUT-OF-TOWNER

You're charging me double the usual

rent! I didn't come up here all the

way from New Rochelle to be gouged

by some Yankee Cracker!

BOAT RENTAL MAN

Prices go up June First every year.

You want a nice cheap, leaky boat,

you go down to the Hamptons.

(he sees Brody)

Right, Chief?

BRODY

Hey! You know how many men that's

supposed to hold?

MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)

Whatever's safe, right?

BRODY

What you got ain't safe. You take

some guys off or you don't go out.

HOOPER

Hello.

GARDNER

Hello, back.

BRODY

You going out too, Ben?

GARDNER

Might give it a try. That three

thousand bounty beats working for a

living.

(yells to his Mate)

We ready?

BRODY

Just back up! No, the other way! Cut

it to your left! Your other left!

The big boat, your front end is out

way too far. Little boat, stay still!

SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)

Dammit, a vessel under sail has the

right of way!

SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)

You schmuck, you ain't under sail,

you're goddam drifting!

HOOPER

(stepping in to help)

Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well,

scull it out!

SAILBOAT SKIPPER

Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

MOTORBOAT SKIPPER

Tell that ragsetter I'm going to

poke him in the snoot!

HOOPER

Just cast off in turn and make for

the channel, OK?

BRODY

Thanks.

HOOPER

Excuse me, I wonder if you could

tell me...

HOOPER

(noticing something)

Is that dynamite?

BRODY

If that's dynamite, give it here, or

don't leave port.

MAN

Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks

like fireworks, it attracts them.

BRODY

Hand it over.

HOOPER

There's a fantail launch out there

that won't make it beyond the

breakwater.

BRODY

You're tellin' me. I swear, this

town has gone crazy.

HOOPER

Officer, I wonder if you could tell

me where I could find Chief Brody?

BRODY

Who are you?

HOOPER

Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the

Oceanographic Institute.

(holds out his hand)

PRATT

Well, get over there! He ain't caught

it yet!

PRATT

(exultant)

Hand me that pole! Quick!

HARRY

Beat it! I hooked him!

PRATT

How's the family, Harry?

(to the man with gaff)

Go on and do it!

MAN WITH GAFF

We split down the middle?

HARRY

(a tug-of-war)

Let go my shark!

BRODY

Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

HOOPER

Victim One, identified as Christine

Watkins, female Caucasian...

HOOPER

...height and weight may only be

estimated from partial remains. Torso

severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated

with no major organs remaining. May

I have a drink of water? Right arm

severed above the elbow with massive

tissue loss from upper musculature.

Portions of denuded bone remaining.

(tense, to Brody)

-- did you notify the coast guard?

BRODY

No, it was local jurisdiction.

HOOPER

Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum

and portions of ribcage intact.

(to Brody)

Please don't smoke. With minor post-

mortem lacerations and abrasions.

Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy

feeding pattern of large squali,

possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or

isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss

and post-mortem erosion of bite

surfaces prevent detailed analysis;

however, teeth and jaws of the

attacking squali must be considered

above average for these waters.

(to Brody again)

-- Did you go out in a boat and look

around?

BRODY

No, we just checked the beach...

HOOPER

(turns off the recorder)

It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a

boat propeller, or a coral reef, or

Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It

was a shark.

MEADOWS

Ginny, get this out on the state

wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New

York. Have one of them pick it up

for the national and call Dave Axelrod

in New York and tell him this is

from me and he owes me one... let's

get a picture.

HOOPER

Well, if one man can catch a fish in

50 days, then I guess 50 of these

bozos can catch a fish in one day --

beginner's luck.

BRODY

(crossing to men around

shark)

You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch

this?

MEADOWS

Okay, everybody, I want to get a

picture for the paper -- could

everyone clear out of the way?

MEADOWS

Could you get out of the shot, young

man?

HOOPER

Who, me? Okay...

(he drifts off)

BRODY

Larry, if you'd see these clowns

leave, you'd never believe they'd

come back with anything. But they

got him!

VAUGHN

That's good. That's real good. Ben

Meadows getting pictures for the

paper.

BRODY

Sure he is.

HOOPER (O.S.)

It's a tiger shark. Very rare in

these waters, and definitely a

maneater.

VAUGHN

Who's that young man?

BRODY

Matt Hooper, the specialist they

send down from the Oceanographic

Institute.

VAUGHN

(speaking to everyone)

I think we all owe a debt of gratitude

to these men for catching this

monster.

PRATT

Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's

that?

GAFFER

Teeth are teeth, right?

HOOPER

I didn't say this wasn't the shark,

I just said I wasn't sure this was

the one...

BRODY

What d'ya mean?

HOOPER

There are hundreds of different kinds

of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads,

white-tips... any one of them could've

attacked. Look -- shark digestion is

slow. We could open this one up, and

find whatever he's been eating is

still inside.

VAUGHN

That's disgusting! This is the

largest, meanest, most vicious shark

ever landed off Amity Island, and a

known maneater!

HOOPER

Let's just cut him open and see what's

inside...

BRODY

Why not, Larry? We could get a

positive confirmation that way.

VAUGHN

Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't

the time or the place to do some

kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.

Ben...

(to Meadows)

do you have all the pictures you

need?

MEADOWS

Plenty.

HOOPER

Wait a minute...

VAUGHN

(seeing something

offstage, with low

intensity)

I am not going to stand here and

watch this fish cut open and see

some kid fall out on the dock.

Besides...

(he indicates off)

VAUGHN

(to Brody)

Chief, I'll take responsibility for

this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch

down before he stinks up the whole

island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl

take him out and dump him right in

the drink.

MRS. KINTNER

Chief Brody?

MRS. KINTNER

My Alex was a beautiful little boy

and you killed him. Did you know

that? You knew there was a shark out

there. You knew a girl got killed

here last week. I just found that

out. But you knew. You knew it was

dangerous, but you let people go

swimming anyway. You knew all those

things, and still my boy is dead now

and there's nothing you can do about

that. My boy is dead. I wanted you

to know that.

VAUGHN

I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick,

terrible state.

HOOPER

Look, maybe this is the wrong time

to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

BRODY

(almost to himself)

She's right.

VAUGHN

Let's all get out of here, this place

stinks.

BRODY

I'm going home.

BRODY

C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.

SEAN

Why?

BRODY

Because he needs it.

HOOPER (O.S.)

Martin Brody residence?

HOOPER

Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband

is here, I'd like to talk to him.

ELLEN

So would I. Come on in.

ELLEN

Would you like something? Some coffee?

HOOPER

(seeing Brody's plate)

Is anyone having this...?

HOOPER

Dynamite!

(to Brody)

How was your day...?

BRODY

Swell.

HOOPER

(producing wine)

Here... one red, one white.

HOOPER

(boning his fish)

Ummm. Really good.

ELLEN

My husband tells me you're in sharks.

HOOPER

I wouldn't put it that way. But I

love sharks.

ELLEN

You love sharks?

HOOPER

I do.

(he tells a story

about his boyhood

and a shark)

But you've still got a problem here,

there's a shark just off the island

somewhere.

BRODY

How come you have to tell them that?

ELLEN

Excuse me, but what are you talking

about? Didn't they catch the shark

this afternoon? It was on the Cape

station news.

HOOPER

They caught a shark, not the shark.

Big difference. I could've proved it

this afternoon, by cutting that one

open and examining his stomach

contents. Also, his bite was too

small.

HOOPER

I was lucky to find that in town --

it's an estate bottled vintage year...

HOOPER

(as Brody pours)

We ought to let it breathe...

Whatever.

BRODY

Let's all have a drink.

BRODY

You too, sweetheart...

ELLEN

Thank you.

HOOPER

(toasting)

Here's to your husband, the only

other rational man on the island.

Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone,

and he'll be the only one.

ELLEN

You're leaving?

HOOPER

Going out on the 'Aurora.'

ELLEN

Is that a boat?

HOOPER

Is it! The best-funded research

expedition to ever study the shark...

around the world in 18 months.

ELLEN

Like those Cousteau specials on

television? I think it's for the

kids, but I love them.

HOOPER

Better than Cousteau, or Compagno

with computers, telemetry, Defense

Department funding...

ELLEN

I saw a show with sea otters, and a

big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made

me promise to get him one. Will you

live on the boat?

HOOPER

Yep.

ELLEN

Martin hates boats. Hates the water.

On the ferry to the mainland, he

sits in the car the whole way over.

He's got this childhood thing, there's

a clinical word for it.

BRODY

Drowning. Lemme ask you something.

Is it true most attacks take place

in three feet of water, around 10

feet from the beach?

HOOPER

Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.

I wish I could've examined that shark

they caught...

BRODY

Something else. Do most attacks go

unreported?

HOOPER

About half of them. A lot of 'missing

swimmers' are really shark victims.

BRODY

There's a kind of a lone shark,

called, uh...

HOOPER

Rogue?

BRODY

Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where

there's food and hangs out there as

long as the food supply lasts?

HOOPER

It's called Territoriality. It's a

theory.

BRODY

And before 1900, when people first

starting swimming for recreation,

before public bathing and resorts,

there were very few shark attacks,

cause sharks didn't know what they

were missing?

HOOPER

You could say that.

BRODY

Why don't we have one more drink,

you and I, and then we go down and

cut open that old shark and see for

sure what's inside him, or not.

ELLEN

Can you do that?

BRODY

I am Chief of Police. I can do

anything I want.

(to Hooper)

You want to come?

HOOPER

I'm flattered you should ask.

HOOPER

...And it was Dartmouth Winter

weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen,

and I was her date; then she got

into the fact that her family had

more money than my family, and she

was right -- her great-grandfather

was in mining, and my ancestors were

Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up

and I went home with some beatnik

from Sarah Lawrence.

BRODY

What stinks so bad?

HOOPER

Our friend, the shark.

HOOPER

We always had a summer place on the

water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I

figured I'd major in something I

knew about. Oceanography, marine

biology. It was that, or design racing

yachts like my older brother. Hmmm.

He we go. Up the old alimentary canal.

Hold the light.

HOOPER

We open the abdominal cavity and

check the digestive tract. Simple.

(he attends to his

work)

BRODY

What's that?

HOOPER

Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap

bag... a paint can... aha!

BRODY

What? What?!

HOOPER

Just as I thought. He drifted up

here with the Gulf Stream, from

southern waters.

BRODY

How can you tell?

HOOPER

(showing it)

Florida license plate.

BRODY

He ate a car?

HOOPER

(laughs)

No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage

cans of the ocean. They eat anything.

But this one didn't eat any people.

There's nothing here...

HOOPER

...Nothing.

BRODY

What do we do?

HOOPER

If you're looking for a shark, you

don't look on land. You go out and

chum for him.

BRODY

Chum?

HOOPER

Only one sure way to find him --

offer him a little something to eat.

Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish,

anything. They can sense it miles

away. If he's out there, we might be

able to get a closer look at him.

(checks his watch)

It's a good time, too. They're night

feeders...

HOOPER

(indicating distant

flashing beacon)

That's the Cape Light -- we're on

the stretch where he's feeding, if

he's still here.

BRODY

What is all this stuff?

HOOPER

(ticking them off)

Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar,

closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft --

RDF, single side band...

(points to themselves)

And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

BRODY

Can you tell from that if a big man-

eater is around?

HOOPER

Sometimes.

(indicates display)

Look here -- something big, probably

a school of mackerel clumped together.

And staying right with us.

BRODY

Where'd you get all this?

HOOPER

I Bought it.  Both sets of

grandparents set up trust funds for

me; stocks went up, so I don't have

to touch my principal.

BRODY

You're at the Institute full time?

Or do you have a job?

HOOPER

(a nerve has been

touched)

It is a job. I'm not fooling around

like some amateur. It's my life!

BRODY

We gotta get back soon...

BRODY

Hey!

BRODY

What the hell?

BRODY

That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the

Flicka! Ben? Ben!

BRODY

What happened?

HOOPER

I want to check something. Hold my

feet.

BRODY

Don't they have lifejackets or

something? An extra boat?

HOOPER

(surfacing)

They must've hit something.

HOOPER

He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm

going down to take a look at his

hull.

BRODY

Why don't we just tow it in?

HOOPER

(hyperventilating)

We will. There's something I've got

to find out.

BRODY

Be careful, for chrissake.

BRODY

You all right?

HOOPER

A White! A Great White, I found a

tooth buried in the hull. He must've

attacked... I knew it... Gardner's

dead in there. I didn't see the

mate...

BRODY

No shark did that to a boat!

HOOPER

Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd

believe it! We're not talking about

a shark, we're talking about a Shark!

BRODY

There is a kind of shark called a

Great White Shark that every expert

in the world agrees is a maneater.

HOOPER

You're situation here suggests that

a Great White has staked out a claim

in the waters around Amity Island,

and that he will continue to feed

here as long as there is food in the

water.

BRODY

There's no limits to where he can

strike, and we've had three attacks

and two deaths in the past few days.

It happened like this before, in

1916, when a Great White killed five

swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long

Island.

HOOPER

A shark's attack is stimulated by

the kind of splashing and activity

that occurs whenever humans go

swimming -- you can't avoid it!

BRODY

A 4th of July beach is like ringing

a dinner bell, for Chrissake!

HOOPER

I just pulled a shark tooth the size

of a shot glass out of the hull of a

wrecked boat out there.

BRODY

We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry;

he was dead and his boat was all

chewed up.

VAUGHN

Is that tooth here? Did anyone see

it?

HOOPER

I don't have it.

BRODY

He lost it on the way up.

VAUGHN

What kind of a shark did you say it

was?

HOOPER

Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.

VAUGHN

Well, I'm not going to commit economic

suicide on that flimsy evidence. We

depend on the summer people for our

lives, and if our beaches are closed,

then we're all finished.

BRODY

We have got to close the beaches. We

have got to get someone to kill the

shark, we need non-corrosive mesh

netting, we need scientific support...

It's gonna cost money just to keep

the nuts out and save what we have.

VAUGHN

I don't thing either of you is

familiar with our problems...

HOOPER

I'm familiar with the fact that you

are going to ignore this thing until

it swims up and bites you on the

ass! There are only two ways to solve

this thing: you can kill it, or you

can cut off its food supply...

BRODY

That means closing the beaches.

VAUGHN

Come here, I want to show you

something.

VAUGHN

Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a

deliberate mutilation of a public

service message! I want those little

paint-happy bastards caught and hung

up by their baby Buster Browns!

HOOPER

(who has followed

them around)

That's it! I'm standing here arguing

with a guy who can't wait to be a

hot lunch. Goodbye.

BRODY

Wait a minute! I need you.

HOOPER

Out there is a Perfect Engine, an

Eating Machine that is a miracle of

evolution -- it swims and eats and

that's all. Look at that! Those

proportions are correct.

(indicates fin)

I know sharks.

VAUGHN

You'd love to prove that. Getting

your name in the National Geographic.

BRODY

Larry, we can re-open the beaches in

August.

VAUGHN

August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July,

and we are going to open for business.

It's going to be our best summer in

years. If you're so concerned about

the beaches, you two, you do whatever

you have to to keep them safe, but

with you or without you, the beaches

stay open this weekend.

OFFICER

Martin Brody?

(Brody nods)

I'll need your signature here...

here... and here.

BRODY

What is this?

OFFICER

Authorization for direct payment of

flight expenses not directly connected

to a normal mission of this command.

(Brody doesn't

understand)

You pay for the gas.

BRODY

I signed on the wrong line...

OFFICER

Just erase your signature and initial

your erasure.

BRODY

I want to thank you guys from local

agencies for cooperating, and I hope

we won't actually be needing your

services. But I'm glad to have you

here.

ENSIGN

I want to get our lines and repellent

out, so we better shove off.

BRODY

(a last caution)

We're all on one channel, so let's

keep radio traffic to a minimum,

okay?

HOOPER

I hope we get some more help.

BRODY

I wish it would rain...

TV DIRECTOR

Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2.

1. Roll.

ANNOUNCER

...and with me is the Mayor of Amity,

Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how

about those rumors?

VAUGHN

How about them indeed. I'm pleased

and happy to repeat the news that we

have, in fact, caught and killed a

large predator that supposedly injured

some bathers here. As you can see,

it's a beautiful day, the beaches

are open, and the folks here are

having a wonderful time. Amity,

y'know, means 'Friendship.'

ANNOUNCER

Also here today is a Marine Biologist

and Research Fellow from the

Oceanographic Institute, Matthew

Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?

HOOPER

What I've heard and what I've seen

are two different things. I believe

there is a large Great White Shark --

Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters

off this very beach, that he has

killed and that he will kill again...

ANNOUNCER

(moving into center

frame)

And there you have it -- two different

opinions, by men of good will. The

holiday crowd here at Amity seems to

be making up its own mind...

BRODY

I'm sorry, I just don't have the

time.

TV DIRECTOR

Recue the machines. 2, pan off the

Chief and show me some tits and ass.

1, get me some cute kids. 3... see

if you got a shot at the water.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

(holds up stopwatch)

Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45

seconds. That's equal time, right?

DIRECTOR

Right.

(he presses "Talkback"

button to his

announcer)

Jerry, come on in and look at this.

(to his headset)

Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)

Amity Island is famed for its clear

air and white sand beaches. But a

cloud appeared...

ANNOUNCER (LIVE)

Look at that shine on my nose. It's

a beacon.

DIRECTOR

Close enough for remote.

VAUGHN (V.O.)

...I'm pleased and happy...

DIRECTOR

Think we ought to stick around?

ANNOUNCER

What else you got?

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Teachers' strike downtown.

CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Christenson, this is Al. Union says

time for Engineering Five.

DIRECTOR

That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

VAUGHN

Why don't you get in the water?

SELECTMAN

I don't want to wash off my suntan

lotion. I'll get a burn...

VAUGHN

(some urgency)

Nobody's going in!

WOMAN

Is there nobody going in? What a

shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)

(pouring tea)

If you'd like.

ARTHUR

(as he enters the

waves)

It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite

refreshing... Very pleasant....

ARTHUR

No sharks, m'lady.

WOMAN

This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to

come back to this very spot. Will

you make a note of where we are?

HENDRICKS

Anything? Thought I saw a shadow.

Over.

COPTER SPOTTER

Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.

HENDRICKS

(into walkie-talkie)

False alarm. Must be this glare.

VOICES

Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up

to your knees, yeah -- So come with

me -- I'll go again.

MEADOWS

Beautiful day, Chief!

BRODY

Hey Mikey -- !

BRODY

You're not going to the ocean with

that, are you son?

MICHAEL

I'm all checked out for light surf

and look at it.

BRODY

Do me this favor just once. Use the

ponds.

MICHAEL

Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

BRODY

Just a favor for your old man.

MICHAEL

(confused)

Sure, Dad.

COPTER SPOTTER

Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!

HENDRICKS

(into walkie-talkie)

Where -- ?

COPTER SPOTTER

Went under your -- There!

SONAR OPERATOR

Jesus Christ -- Shark!

BRODY

Everybody out! Out of the water,

please -- leave the water, please --

BRODY

No whistles! No whistles!

TV DIRECTOR

Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody

get that!

THE VICTIM

(passing a horrified

Michael, who half

extends one hand, as

if to help)

It's no good. I'm dead...

(and he is)

HOOPER

Block the estuary! The estuary!

BRODY

(feeling his face)

He's in shock. Get blankets!

NURSE

The doctor said it's okay -- mild

shock. He can come home in the

morning.

ELLEN

(to Michael)

Hey, big guy -- you want anything

from home?

MICHAEL

My cars. And a comic book.

BRODY

(sees Vaughn)

Here --

(gives baby to Ellen)

Take him home.

ELLEN

Home... New York?

BRODY

No. Home here.

BRODY

(crossing to Vaughn)

Got a pen on you?

VAUGHN

Why?

BRODY

There's only one thing you're good

for anymore -- signing a damn voucher.

Here. It's an authorization to employ

a contractor.

VAUGHN

I don't know if I can do that without

a...

BRODY

(interrupting)

I'm going to hire Quint to kill the

fish. I want to see that shark dead.

VAUGHN

Maybe we can save August...

BRODY

Forget it. This summer's had it.

Next summer's had it. You're the

mayor of Shark City. You wanted to

keep the beaches open. What happens

when the town finds out about that?

VAUGHN

I was acting in the town's best

interests...

BRODY

The best interest in this town would

be to see that fish belly-up in the

water with a hole in his head. You

do the right thing. You authorize

me.

(indicates paper)

Right there. Whatever it costs.

VAUGHN

My kids were on that beach...

BRODY

Just sign it, Larry.

BRODY

This has got to be one big

violation...

HOOPER

(handling some gear)

This is quite a place.

QUINT'S VOICE

Keep your hands off my stuff.

QUINT

Did you bring a check?

BRODY

What?

QUINT

Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake

and a promise?

BRODY

I'm authorized by the township of

Amity to hire you as an independent

contractor. We'll meet your price.

$10,000.

QUINT

And my regular daily rate -- $200,

whether we catch him or not.

BRODY

You got it.

QUINT

And incidental damages, if any...

BRODY

You got it.

QUINT

And you get the Mayor off my back

with this zoning crap. Nobody tells

me how to run my property.

BRODY

You got it.

QUINT

And, uh, a case of apricot brandy

and you buy the lunch.

BRODY

Two cases. And dinner when you land.

QUINT

(pours drink)

Try some of this. I made it myself.

QUINT

Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged

women.

HERSCHEL

Mr. Quint...

HERSCHEL

I'm not goin'. No sir.

QUINT

You want to get paid, you go.

HERSCHEL

Forget the money. You can't pay me

enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some

big mean fish with you, but I ain't

goin' on this one.

QUINT

This is the last time I hear from

you. I don't want anyone with piss

for blood on my vessel. Put that

blackfish on board, pump the bilges,

and top off the fuel tanks, and finish

up in the morning. Then you're on

the beach.

HOOPER

You're going to need an extra hand...

BRODY

This is Matt Hooper...

QUINT

I know who he is...

BRODY

He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

HOOPER

I've been to sea since I was 12.

I've crewed three Trans-pacs --

QUINT

Transplants?

HOOPER

-- and an America's Cup Trials...

QUINT

I'm not talking about day sailing or

pleasure boating. I'm talking about

working for a living. Sharking.

HOOPER

And I'm not talking about hooking

some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm

talking about a Great White.

QUINT

Are you now. I know about porkers in

the water --

(throws him some rope)

Here. Tie me a sheepshank.

HOOPER

I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

QUINT

Let me see your hands...

QUINT

Ha. City hands. You been counting

money. If you had a $5000 net and

$2000 worth of fish in it, and along

comes Mr. White, and makes it look

like a kiddy scissors class has gone

to work on it and made paper dolls.

If you'd ever worked for a living,

you'd know what that means.

HOOPER

Look, I don't need to hear any of

this working class hero crap. Some

party boat skipper who's killed a

few sharks...

BRODY

(interrupting)

Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to

have to listen to this while we're

out there...

QUINT

What do you mean 'We...?'

BRODY

It's my charter. My party.

QUINT

All right, Commissioner. But when

we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate

and Pilot. And I want him...

(indicates Hooper)

...along for ballast.

BRODY

You got it.

QUINT

5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number

14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs,

tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips,

pliers, irons...

HOOPER

Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator,

tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra

magazines, cage...

ASSISTANT

You got everything you asked for?

HOOPER

All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for

me. And tell Borack I'll catch up

with them in New Zealand.

ASSISTANT

This is actually a killing expedition?

HOOPER

An eye for an eye, you know.

QUINT

Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this

gear or you want me to use it for

ballast? It ain't good for much but

bait.

HOOPER

(to Assistant)

I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.

QUINT

Hello, Junior. What are you? Some

kind of half-assed astronaut?

(to himself)

Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every

little squirt wanted to be a harpooner

or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have

there -- a portable shower?

HOOPER

Anti-Shark cage.

QUINT

Who's inside, you or the shark?

QUINT

You're in the cage?

(Hooper nods)

The cage is in the water?

(Hooper nods)

The shark is in the water too?

(Hooper nods)

You're in the water with the shark.

HOOPER

Comin' aboard...

ELLEN

Did you take your dramamine?

(Brody nods)

Here.

QUINT

Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.

ELLEN

Is that him?

BRODY

(to Ellen)

Colorful, isn't he?

ELLEN

You going to be all right?

BRODY

Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive

this.

ELLEN

I'll see you back soon. There's an

extra pair of glasses in your black

socks, and there's some suntan lotion

and blistex in your kit.

QUINT (O.S.)

(sings)

'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For

15 years she kept her virginity. Not

a bad record for this vicinity.'

BRODY

Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

ELLEN

(hugging him)

What'll I tell the kids?

BRODY

Tell 'em I went fishin'!

QUINT

Cast off the bow line! Now your stern!

QUINT

(to Brody)

Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port,

Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a

staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a

rope, it's a line, and if you don't

get it right...

(indicates porthole)

I'll throw your ass through that

little round window.

QUINT

Now hear this. You're aboard the

fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her

Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner.

You'll jump when I holler. We're

doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't

got time to watch you birds get hooks

in your ass and fall overboard. Ship

with me, and you'll do all right.

Cross me, and I'll slap you upside

your heads. Now -- if you boys are

ready -- let's go fishin'.

DISSOLVE TO:

QUINT

Here's something for you...

QUINT

These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat

their own guts.

QUINT

Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em

where you got it!

HOOPER

What's that supposed to prove?

QUINT

Just a little appetizer. I want our

porker to know we're serving. I want

to put some iron into that big yap...

DISSOLVE TO:

QUINT

Keep that chum line going -- we've

got five good miles. Don't break it.

BRODY

Who's driving the boat?

QUINT

Nobody. We're drifting with the

current.

HOOPER

(using the fish finder)

Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Hell, in the old days we went out

with good charts, good sounding lead,

and a damn good compass. Nowadays,

these kids are afraid to go out

without depth finders, radar, radio,

electric toothbrush, every stupid

thing...

QUINT

(to Brody)

Get a fresh barrel.

HOOPER

(jumping up)

Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw

around with one of those and Boom!

Careful, huh?

QUINT

(mutters)

Real fine stuff but it won't mean a

thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he

didn't go to schools in electronics.

He was born with what he does best.

Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course

he might eat this stuff, but then

I've seen him eat a rocking chair,

too.

(to Brody)

Next time, ask me.

DISSOLVE TO:

HOOPER

(eyeing bait)

That's pilot whale, isn't it?

QUINT

It ain't a Big Mac.

(to Brody)

The expert don't approve. What do

you thing? You're closer to the

situation.

(laughs)

BRODY

(croaky)

Why are we way out here, when the

shark's back there?

QUINT

(snapping bait to his

leader)

...'cause this is where he lives.

You gotta think like they do.

HOOPER

(to himself)

Easy for you -- they got a brain the

size of a radish.

QUINT

(to Brody)

Now if he weren't around, we'd of

hooked something else by now, wouldn't

we? But he scared 'em all away. Big

lonesome son of a bitch...

DISSOLVE TO:

QUINT

-- he'll gulp it down now...

(making gulping noises)

Hooooooo!

BRODY

You got it?

QUINT

(turning with the

pull)

Get behind me, dummy!

(shouts to Hooper)

Reverse her and turn -- he's taking

too much line!

(to Brody)

Wet my reel, quick!

QUINT

(straining, muscles

popping)

Starboard, for Chris'sake --

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...

HOOPER

(almost to himself)

Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel

boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh,

Jim Boy.

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Neutral!

(to himself)

Where the hell is he going?

QUINT

Oh, this ain't foolin' me --

(rod arcs down with a

surge)

Sure -- try it!

QUINT

Makin' believe it's easy now.

QUINT

Gettin' ready to run again -- no?

No?

(suspicious)

What's he playin' here?

(reels in furiously,

to Brody)

Put the gloves on!

(to fish)

Let's see who's gonna tease who now!

HOOPER

Let it go, don't waste your time.

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Down here, Hooper!

HOOPER

I don't know what it is, but it's

not a shark.

QUINT

(bathed in sweat;

hauling, reeling)

Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in

the lab, but out here you're just

supercargo, and you'll do as I say,

or you can take your gear and

backstroke home. Now get down here!

BRODY

The wire's showing!

QUINT

(to Brody)

Unbuckle me -- fast!

(to Hooper)

Grab the leader. He ain't normal,

this one... they never --

HOOPER

It's too wild, too erratic. It's a

marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.

QUINT

Watch your hands --

(suddenly to Brody)

Grab onto this!

QUINT

(to Hooper)

A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't

ever tell me my business again. Get

back up on the bridge.

HOOPER

(stunned)

I'm okay...

QUINT

(to Brody)

Fasten the pole.

BRODY

What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

QUINT

Don't tell me my business!

(to Hooper, points)

Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

BRODY

(nursing forehead,

gesturing at rod and

reel)

How -- if they're gonna keep on

breaking?

QUINT

What I do is trick him to the surface,

got that? Then I can jab him,

understand?

(goes to flybridge,

muttering)

Think I'm gonna haul it in as if

he's a catfish, like everyone else

does?

QUINT

(suddenly, pointing)

Over there!

HOOPER

What do you see?

QUINT

(still looking)

At least you handle the boat all

right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

HOOPER

20 feet, if it's an inch...

QUINT

25 feet. And three tons of him there.

QUINT

(quietly, to Brody)

I never saw one that big.

BRODY

What do we do? Get some help? Radio

in?

BRODY

How're we gonna handle this?

HOOPER

(very, very high)

There's a formula! Girth, about 150

inches, squared, divide by 800 --

son of a bitch, they are not going

to believe this! -- divide by 2000...

three tons!

(after Quint)

You're right, you old fart! Three

tons!

(ad libs ecstasy)

RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

Amity Point Light Station to Orca.

This is Amity Point Light Station,

to Orca...

QUINT

Orca here.

RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

I have Mrs. Martin Brody here...

QUINT

Put her on.

ELLEN'S VOICE

...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello,

Martin?

QUINT

This is Quint, Missus.

ELLEN'S VOICE

I just wanted to know if you were

all right... the Coast Guard let me

use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?

QUINT

He's busy.

ELLEN'S VOICE

Well... is everything all right?

QUINT

Just fine, Missus. We'll be back

soon. Everything's fine. We haven't

seen anything yet. Orca out.

HOOPER

(on deck)

Damn it! I need something in the

foreground to give it some scale.

Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!

QUINT

Here. Rig this to the forward keg up

there.

QUINT

(to Brody)

Get up there and steer her. Follow

my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've

got to get a clean shot at that

porker's head.

QUINT

Hurry up, rig the line!

QUINT

(to Brody)

Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady

now...

QUINT

The line, man, the line!

QUINT

Get clear, damn you!

HOOPER

Clear!

QUINT

Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

QUINT

Now you've done it, you piss-ant.

Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to

my gear. Let the bastard fight the

keg for a while. He can't stay down

with that on.

HOOPER

(to Quint)

Rig another keg! I'm bringing her

around!

HOOPER

(to himself)

God damn it! We had him!

(to Quint)

I'm coming about!

BRODY

Why don't we go in? Get another crack

at him tomorrow.

QUINT

We got a barrel on him. We can't

lose him. We stay out here until we

find him.

BRODY

Let's call in -- we can radio and

have a big boat here in an hour...

QUINT

(grim)

You hired me, remember? It's my

$10,000. It's my shark...

QUINT

He's up again.

QUINT

That's not so bad. Look at this:

...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans,

in Boston, where some sunovabitch

winged me upside the head with a

spittoon.

HOOPER

Look here.

(extends a forearm)

Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

QUINT

Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay

from taking my head off.

HOOPER

(rolling up a sleeve)

Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet

suit.

QUINT

Face and head scars come from amateur

amusements in the bar room. This

love line here...

(he bends an ear

forward)

...that's from some crazy Frenchie

come after me with a knife. I caught

him with a good right hand right in

the snot locker and laid him amongst

the sweetpeas.

HOOPER

Ever see one like this?

HOOPER

Bull shark scraped me while I was

taking samples...

QUINT

Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --

QUINT

Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look

just like somebody caressed me with

a nutmeg grater...

HOOPER

I'll drink to your leg.

QUINT

And I'll drink to yours.

QUINT

Wait a minute, young fella. Look.

Just look. Don't touch...

QUINT

...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope

and onto the deck. You don't get

bitten by one of those bastards but

twice -- your first and your last.

HOOPER

(considerably drunker)

I think I can top that, Mister...

HOOPER

Gimme a hand, here. I got something

to show you --

HOOPER

(indicating his chest)

There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit

broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary

Ellen.

QUINT

And here's to the ladies. And here's

to their sisters; I'd rather one

Miss than a shipload of Misters.

QUINT

(shows belly)

Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.

BRODY

(aside)

C'mon. Middle appendix --

QUINT

(aside)

I almost had 'im.

BRODY

(pointing)

What's that one, there?

QUINT

(changing)

Tattoo. Had it taken off.

HOOPER

Don't tell me -- 'Death Before

Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.'

Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon --

what?

QUINT

'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.

BRODY

What's that, a ship?

HOOPER

(incredulous)

You were on the Indianapolis? In

'45? Jesus...

QUINT

Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.

June 29th, 1945, three and a half

minutes past midnight, two torpedoes

from a Japanese submarine slammed

into our side. Two or three. We was

still under sealed orders after

deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima

bomb...we was goin' back across the

Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn

near eleven hundred men went over

the side. The life boats was lashed

down so tight to make the bomb run

we couldn't cut a single one adrift.

Not one. And there was no rafts.

None. That vessel sank in twelve

minutes. Yes, that's all she took.

We didn't see the first shark till

we'd been in the water about an hour.

A thirteen-footer near enough. A

blue. You measure that by judgin'

the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't

know... of course the Captain knew...I

guess some officers knew... was the

bomb mission had been so secret, no

distress signals was sent. What the

men didn't know was that they wouldn't

even list us as overdue for a week.

Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't

an officer -- just as well perhaps.

So some of us were dead already --

in the water -- just hangin' limp in

our lifejackets. And several already

bleedin'. And the three hundred or

so laying on the bottom of the ocean.

As the light went, the sharks came

crusin'. We formed tight groups --

somewhat like squares in an old battle --

You know what I mean -- so that when

one come close, the man nearest would

yell and shout and pound the water

and sometimes it worked and the fish

turned away, but other times that

shark would seem to look right at a

man -- right into his eyes -- and in

spite of all shoutin' and poundin'

you'd hear that terrible high

screamin' and the ocean would go

red, then churn up as they ripped

him.  Then we'd reform our little

squares. By the first dawn the sharks

had taken more than a hundred. Hard

for me to count but more than a

hundred. I don't know how many sharks.

Maybe a thousand. I do know they

averaged six men an hour. All kinds --

blues, makos, tigers. All kinds.

(Pause)

In the middle of the second day,

some of us started to go crazy from

the thirst. One fella cried out he

saw a river, another claimed he saw

a waterfall, some started to drink

the ocean and choked on it, and some

left our little groups -- our little

squares -- and swam off alone lookin'

for islands and the sharks always

took them right away. It was mainly

the young fellas that did that --

the older ones stayed where they

was. That second day -- my life jacket

rubbed me raw and that was more blood

in the water. Oh my. On Thursday

morning I bumped up against a friend

of mine -- Herbie Robinson from

Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it

seemed he was asleep but when I

reached over to waken him, he bobbed

in the water and I saw his body upend

because he'd been bitten in half

beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it

went on -- bombers high overhead but

nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,

sharks, and all this goin' crazy and

dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day,

Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung

around and came in low. Yes. He did

that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And

early evenin', a big fat PBY come

down out of the sky and began the

pickup.  That was when I was most

frightened of all -- while I was

waitin' for my turn. Just two and a

half hours short of five days and

five nights when they got to me and

took me up. Eleven hundred of us

went into that ocean -- three hundred

and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen

hundred and forty five. June the

29th.

(pause)

Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

BRODY

What the hell?

HOOPER

It's a whale out there.

QUINT

(singing)

Show me the way to go home... I'm

tired and I want to go to bed. I had

a little drink about an hour ago,

and it went right to my head.

(etc.)

QUINT

(quietly, to Hooper)

Start the engines.

QUINT

He's busting the shaft! Start the

pump!

BRODY

Where...?

QUINT

The bilge pumps. There --

QUINT

Cut the engines!

HOOPER

Rudder bearings?

QUINT

(to Brody)

Get up forward! Watch for him!

QUINT

Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!

QUINT

Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

QUINT

(sings)

Show me the way to go home... I'm

tired and I want to go to bed.

(etc.)

QUINT

More left rudder! More! Left hand

down now, Chief.

HOOPER

(shifting his grip)

Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

QUINT

He's bent the housing. You can hear

it.

BRODY

The barrel!

QUINT

It's him.

QUINT

He's under the keg. Careful --

QUINT

(suspicious)

Easy -- just want to goose him up.

The minute he runs, drop it or you'll

lose your hands.

QUINT

Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's

been doin'.

BRODY

(top of his lungs)

Shark! Starboard!

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!

(then to Brody on the

bridge)

Start the engine!

QUINT

Easy! It'll tear right out!

HOOPER

(hauling)

The shaft is giving.

BRODY

(on bridge)

That's it! Radio in for help!

QUINT

Shut up! Just pump her out!

BRODY

(coming down off the

bridge)

Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a

call.

QUINT (O.S.)

Beg your pardon --

QUINT

Duty first and pleasure after --

QUINT

Excuse me!

BRODY

Some great idea! Now where are we?

Some goddamn skipper you are. You're

certifiable, y'know that? You're a

real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!

HOOPER

Coming right to us!

QUINT

No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead,

he'll hit us head on --

(the engine clanks)

Slower! Throttle back ---

QUINT

(raising harpoon)

Hard to port!

QUINT

Try shakin' that out!

BRODY

(shouting to Quint)

Did you get him in the head?

QUINT

(to Brody)

No! No! No!

(to Hooper)

Swing around! After him!

QUINT

More gas... go to half! Get me right

alongside him --

HOOPER

(shouting down)

We can't rev it up this high --

QUINT

Watch it!

QUINT

Atta boy!

QUINT

Take two, they're small!

HOOPER

(shouting at Brody)

Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy

on his own blood already!

BRODY

I can't stand here doing nothing!

QUINT

Order in the court!

QUINT

(racing over)

Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble

with two!

QUINT

Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

QUINT

Get ready! Now snag 'em!

QUINT

Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto

the transom -- free ride.

QUINT

Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a

little reverse for you!

QUINT

Haul in -- watch the prop!

QUINT

Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us

to pieces.

QUINT

Damn head is too far away. He's too

big.

QUINT

(amazed at the shark's

strength)

He can't go so deep. Not with all

those on him.

BRODY

What about us?

QUINT

(mentally assessing

the damage)

Have to pump her steady, s'all.

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Follow him --

(to Brody)

You start pumpin' out here.

HOOPER (O.S.)

(on bridge)

He's heading under -- !

QUINT

(incredulously)

No way! He can't!

BRODY

Where'd he go?

QUINT

(helplessly)

He can't stay down with three barrels

on him! Where is he?!

BRODY

Have you ever had one do this?

QUINT

(and he means this)

No!

QUINT

Follow him!

HOOPER

He's under!

BRODY

There!

(points wildly)

BRODY

He's trying to sink us!

QUINT

(to Hooper)

Dead astern! Zig-zag!

BRODY

He's chasing us! I

don't believe it.

QUINT

Full throttle! To port!

HOOPER

(suddenly giving Quint

the wheel)

Hold her.

HOOPER

(loading)

Keep him there! Keep him!

QUINT

Throttling back!

QUINT

(very quietly, to

Hooper)

What can that gun of yours do?

HOOPER

Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine

nitrate. If I can hit him. I can

kill him. But I gotta be close.

Very close.

BRODY

(the awful realization)

You gotta go in the water...

CUT TO:

HOOPER

(in command now)

Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

HOOPER

Take me up.

HOOPER

Lower away, Chief.

(then, to Quint)

Try and keep him off me till I'm

under.

QUINT

Let go of it!

QUINT

(a horrible scream)

He's comin' up -- !

BRODY

He's taken him!

HOOPER

Quint...?

BRODY

No...

(notices something

O.S.)

You think we can get back with those?

BRODY

What day is this?

HOOPER

Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I

think.

BRODY

Think the tide's with us?

HOOPER

Just keep kicking.

BRODY

Y'know, I used to hate the water...

HOOPER

I can't imagine why.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT:

THE END
