Being the true storie of one Ichabod Crane

and the Headless Horseman

Third Draft

A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,

of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...

1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York

New York City

CONSTABLE ONE

Where are you?!

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Here!  Over here!

MAN

I need your help with this.

CONSTABLE ONE

Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane...

is that you?

ICHABOD

Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...

(lifting, struggling)

I found someone here...

ICHABOD

Someone quite dead.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Burn it.

CONSTABLE ONE

Yes, sir.

ICHABOD

Just a moment... if I may.  It is

possible this man was murdered.

HIGH CONSTABLE

He drowned.  Anyone could see.

ICHABOD

There are surgical ways of telling

how he died... by the water in his

lungs...

HIGH CONSTABLE

He will be burned pursuant to

statutes of health.

ICHABOD

I could determine if he were dead

before

he went into the Hudson.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Must we again hear these heretical

rantings?

MAGISTRATE

Yes, must we?

ICHABOD

There is nothing heretical about

science, sir.  The Chinese have

written on it for hundreds of

years... procedural study used to

solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

ICHABOD

Our first night watch is adequate

against fire and some violence,

but if we were more often able to

ensure justice, after the fact,

then criminals would truly have

something to fear from law

enforcement.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Have they nothing to fear presently?

ICHABOD

Without disrespect, look around you.

(motioning to cells)

We overflow.  As do our courts.

HIGH CONSTABLE

And,

with

disrespect, Constable,

if jails and courts overflow, it is

testimony to success, not failure.

ICHABOD

But, how many innocents rot here?

And, how many victims are buried

without reprisal while guilty men

roam our streets?

HIGH CONSTABLE

Very few, if any.

ICHABOD

Even though I have seen confessions

pried from the lips of the accused,

often quite literally?

HIGH CONSTABLE

For one who calls himself a

Federalist, your mouth reeks of

Republican liberalism.

ICHABOD

Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

MAGISTRATE

(to High Constable)

Um, sir... might I suggest...

HIGH CONSTABLE

(to Ichabod)

There is a farming community

upstate, Constable... ten days

journey north in the Hudson

Highlands.  It is named Sleepy

Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three

persons have been murdered there.

Each with their head lopped cleanly

off.

(holds up papers)

The elders of the Hollow have sent

dispatches to me, requesting

assistance, and now, just this very

moment, I have chosen you.

ICHABOD

Chosen me?

HIGH CONSTABLE

These "methods" of yours... there

has been no practical application.

ICHABOD

Not for lack of trying.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Just so.  Granted.  And so you take

your experimentations to Sleepy

Hollow and catch the murderer who

has tainted the place.  Bring him

here to face our good justice.

Will you do this for me?

ICHABOD

(swallowing doubt)

I shall, gladly.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Excellent.  Then, you are excused

till morning.

HIGH CONSTABLE

Oh, and, Constable...

(off Ichabod's look)

Do make certain that you meet with

success.  Otherwise... perhaps you

should not come back at all.

ICHABOD (o.s.)

Such a day for such a sad farewell.

But, this is goodbye, my sweet.

ICHABOD'S P.O.V.

: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole

BLINDFOLDED WOMAN

This is such a silly game.

BROM

Be a sport and stop complaining.

LITTLE GIRL

Play along.  You must.

BLINDFOLDED WOMAN

There, I have someone.  Am I

finished?

LITTLE GIRL

You have to tell who it is.

LITTLE GIRL

At least make a guess.

BLINDFOLDED WOMAN

I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?

BROM

Certainly not.

ICHABOD

Excuse me, Miss...

(takes her hands)

They have a laugh at your expense.

KATRINA

Forgive me, I didn't know.

ICHABOD

I... I am looking for Baltus Van

Tassel.

BROM

We haven't heard your name yet,

friend.

ICHABOD

Well, unless your name is Baltus,

you should not worry over mine.

BROM

You need some manners.

KATRINA

Brom!

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

What is this, then... ?

BALTUS

Can I help you, sir?

ICHABOD

I have been sent from the city

with a letter of introduction.

I am told you offer me room and

board.

ICHABOD

If we could speak alone.

BALTUS

(nods, looks to Katrina)

This is not a time for frivolity,

Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?

KATRINA

They're only children, father.

BALTUS

That will be all, ladies.

(waits as they exit)

We are joined by Doctor Thomas

Lancaster, Constable.  And to his

left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and

our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,

both keeping order in their own ways.

BALTUS

I myself am in charge of financial

matters and the regulation of

currency in our commonwealth.  And,

lastly, this fine fellow is James

Hardenbrook, our Notary.

ICHABOD

An honor, gentlemen.  In time I

will need every detail of the

three murderings you've had, but,

for now, I ask only if you have

any theory at all as to who the

killer might be?

DOCTOR LANCASTER

Excuse me?

ICHABOD

I say, is there any one person

suspect in these acts?

DOCTOR LANCASTER

I was afraid of this.

PHILIPSE

Well, Constable... are you aware...

to be honest, you are not what we

expected.  We sent for the militia.

ICHABOD

The militia?

FATHER STEENWYCK

Why not tell us what you have heard?

Hmm?  How much have your superiors

bothered to tell you?

ICHABOD

All I know is three are slain, their

heads found severed from their

bodies...

FATHER STEENWYCK

The heads were not found severed.

The heads were not found at all.

HARDENBROOK

Taken.  Taken by the Headless

Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

ICHABOD

Pardon me?

BALTUS

You have not been well informed of

our troubles, sir.  If you would...

BALTUS

The Horseman... he was a Hessian

mercenary, sent to our shores by

German princes to help keep

Americans under the thumb of

England.  However, unlike his

compatriots who came as muscle in

trade for currency, he came

willingly.  For love of carnage.

FLASHBACK

-- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

BALTUS (v.o.)

He was infamous for taking his

horse, Daredevil, hard into

battle... chopping off heads at

full gallop.

BALTUS (v.o.)

Just to look on him made your

blood run cold, for he had filed

down his teeth to rapiers... to

add to the ferocity of his

appearance.

BALTUS (v.o.)

He would not finally meet his end

till the winter of seventy-nine,

when New York City was held by

Henry Clinton and Washington

occupied West Point.  It was

between those two places, not far

from here...

PHILIPSE

Cut off his head with his own sword.

It's a legend told for twenty years.

BALTUS

But, only recently has the Headless

Hessian been seen prowling the

Hollow, in search of a head to suit

his shoulders.

ICHABOD

Just a moment...

(sits back, incredulous)

Are you saying it is he?

HARDENBROOK

(aggravated, loud)

When a goblin leaps from the nether

world, others follow.  Poltergeists

of the air, water and earth follow

and cheer his desecrations!

DOCTOR LANCASTER

No one knows why he chose to now to

climb out from his grave.

FATHER STEENWYCK

It is very clear why.  Citizens

here have long tried to hide sins

behind closed doors.  Their failed

faith has saturated the soil and

called forth one of Satan's own.

ICHABOD

Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who

has seen this Horseman?

BALTUS

Many have.

ICHABOD

Then, name one person who has seen

him with their own eyes.

ICHABOD

While I will do everything I can

to find your assassin, I will look

for a man of flesh and blood.  Not

some goblin-demon from hell.

PHILIPSE

Gather round!  Gather and quiet!

The hour has come to choose for

this night.  Each man's name is

in this box and has been checked.

PHILIPSE

May the Lord watch over him...

(unfolds paper)

"Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?

JONATHAN (o.s.)

I am.  I take my responsibility.

YOUNG MASBATH

No, father.  Wait...

(up to Philipse)

He's already been up once.  Why

does he go again?

JONATHAN

It is a lottery, son.  It just as

easily might have been one of them.

YOUNG MASBATH

Then... I go with you.

JONATHAN

No.  You obey my wishes.

(looks to crowd)

Brom.  Look after him, will you?

PHILIPSE

Someone leave him a horse.

ICHABOD

You worry for naught, little man.

Nothing will harm him there.

(looks up, sotto)

It is problems here on the ground

you people need begin to worry

about.

KATRINA (v.o.)

You will dream.

KATRINA

Did they tell?  It is something in

the air so that dreams come to

everyone.  According to the elders,

an Indian prophet held powwows here

before the land was taken, and

spells cast then still linger to

this day.

ICHABOD

Do you often make a habit of

sitting on strange men's beds?

KATRINA

You are horribly old-fashioned,

aren't you?

ICHABOD

Feel free to form your own opinion.

(facing his ledger)

Though it appears you already have.

KATRINA

Well, I intended to apologize for

the behavior of my friend Brom Van

Brunt, but it seems I've made

matters worse.

(getting up to go)

I'll leave you to your business.

ICHABOD

Excuse me... I should apologize.  I,

um... I... have no great love of...

KATRINA

Other people?

ICHABOD

Small talk.

KATRINA

It might have been more.  Might have

been positively grand talk.

KATRINA

Is it me, or are you this nervous

around all women?

ICHABOD

Perhaps it is because your suitor's

hands were recently very nearly

wrapped around my throat.

KATRINA

My suitor?

ICHABOD

The massive fellow... Brom.  For

someone you call "friend," he

misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

KATRINA

He has proposed to me twice.

ICHABOD

Which may explain his temperament.

To have asked twice means the answer

was "no" at least once.

KATRINA

I've read a great deal about your

New York City.  Do be a dear and tell

me all about it.  Sounds like an

extraordinary place to live a life.

ICHABOD

Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you

tell me about the Headless Horseman.

JONATHAN

Come out, devil... come....

KATRINA

Not all think it is the Horseman.

Many say witches come from the

Western Woods to steal skulls for

their cauldrons.  Some believe a

person in this very town kneels

before Lucifer, offering death as

tribute.  And, still others believe

none of it.

ICHABOD

Are you so superstitious?

KATRINA

To call a person superstitious is to

imply they fear magic, but not all

magic is black.

ICHABOD

There is no such thing as magic.

KATRINA

Really?  Then... what is your

rebuttal to those romantic poets

claiming proof of magic in a rose at

full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

ICHABOD

Poets have silly notions about

plants and bodily secretions.

KATRINA

(laughs)

You are funny.

BALTUS

Constable, where are you going!?

BALTUS

Come back, sir...

(watches him go)

Madness.

HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.

: closing in on Jonathan.

ICHABOD

The Van Garretts died first; a man

and his son, survived by a wife and

two infants.  And the Widow Windsor

was next...

PHILIPSE

And now Jonathan Masbath.

ICHABOD

(looks back, ponders)

Why would he flee this direction,

with so much open ground to cross

before he reached cover?

PHILIPSE

He would not have gone into the

Western Woods.  No sane man would.

PHILIPSE

Van Ripper there...

PHILIPSE

... found the body this morning.

(pause)

You do believe now, don't you?

ICHABOD

Believe?

LADY VAN TASSEL

You said yourself.  What mere man

could have downed the Belltower?

ICHABOD

It is a prime tenet of science,

Philipse, that because one thing

appears improbable does not mean

you embrace the utterly fantastical.

PHILIPSE

You need less big words, and more

common sense.

ICHABOD

What is that you wear?

PHILIPSE

My talisman.  It will, protect

against the Horseman if I show a

brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If

I run in fear, it is worthless.

ICHABOD

Well... so much for common sense.

BALTUS

Was this Jonathan's?

BROM

Yes.  Seems he panicked across here

and broke two legs.

ICHABOD

Who took the meat?

BALTUS

Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape

Indian lives in the Western Woods.

ICHABOD

These woods of yours sound a bit

crowded, what with all the witches,

ghouls and Indians living there.

BROM

There's only one Lenape.  He eats

small animals and lost children...

and the occasional constable when he

can get it.

ICHABOD

Why did you move the body, Doctor?

DOCTOR LANCASTER

To place it inside its coffin.

BROM

What the hell are you doing?

ICHABOD

(ignoring pause)

You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod

a horse with a hoof this large?

BROM

Never.  A shoe that size I would

have remembered.

ICHABOD

Van Ripper.  Can you show where the

body lay?

VAN RIPPER

I can show exactly.

VAN RIPPER

Here... in front of this oak, facing

north.  Horrible...

ICHABOD

To the best of your recollection,

where did the open wound fall?

ICHABOD

There was not much blood, was there?

VAN RIPPER

I didn't see none.

ICHABOD

No bleeding.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

What is that?

ICHABOD

This should have bled by the pint.

Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.

How... ?  Whatever weapon was used...

it cauterized somehow....

ICHABOD

It instantly burnt the wound shut.

ICHABOD

I am not here for revenge.  I am

here to bring justice.

YOUNG MASBATH

Whatever.  You still need a second

to tend to your things.

ICHABOD

I manage fine alone.

YOUNG MASBATH

I deserve to help you.  Don't you see

how much this means?  My father...

he... he was a good man...

ICHABOD

(faces Masbath)

Young Masbath, I am sorry for your

loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy.

However... I cannot be the one to

look after you now.

YOUNG MASBATH

(angry)

I did not ask you to, did I?

BALTUS

Hail, Constable.  How are you?

ICHABOD

Well enough.  Your gathering does

honor to the deceased.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

(still using spyglass)

We must be a curious sight to him.

ICHABOD

What are you spying on?

DOCTOR LANCASTER

(offers the spyglass)

The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at

civilization from time to time.

DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)

Do you see the Redskinned bastard?

ICHABOD

He is a behemoth.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

A diseased monster.

BALTUS

If you gentlemen will excuse the

doctor and I... we have financial

matters to discuss.

KILLIAN

Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have

time alone.  You've been told plenty

about the Horseman, I'm certain.

ICHABOD

More than enough, actually.

(tired laugh)

I beg you, no more, please.

KILLIAN

No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say

you just laid eyes on our murderer

through that glass.

ICHABOD

Tell me something.

(pause)

What becomes of Young Masbath?

KILLIAN

Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take

him.  They have children and a good

home and good land.

ICHABOD

Find yourself a place in the servants'

residence and wake me before dawn.

Our first task will be an unsavory one.

FATHER STEENWYCK

It is sacrilege!

ICHABOD

I cannot proceed without examining

the previous victims.

FATHER STEENWYCK

Magistrate Philipse, surely you can

stop this.

FATHER STEENWYCK

I will not allow it.  I will not!

ICHABOD

Protest to my superiors if you like.

FATHER STEENWYCK

Your superiors are two days away!

ICHABOD

Then, you should have left two days

ago, because I have men willing to

help me today.

ICHABOD

Why was I not told of this?

KILLIAN

The Widow Windsor.

ICHABOD

Is that all you say?  Look at her.

KILLIAN

It's not something people speak of

openly.  She did not remarry.

ICHABOD

What is the common thread between

these victims?

YOUNG MASBATH

I'm sure I don't know.

ICHABOD

We must discover it.  The reason the

murderer chose these persons.

ICHABOD

The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.

No chopping or half-measures either.

One stroke took the head.  Have you

seen, doctor... ?

(pointing to it)

Even the spinal bone... sliced as

smooth as butter.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

I do not care.  You are welcome to

use my work area, but I beg you...

return her to her resting place.

ICHABOD

In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.

ICHABOD

You should step outside.

FATHER STEENWYCK

The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.

The Lord will not forgive your sins.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.

ICHABOD

Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought

a forgotten candle was burning.

KATRINA

You do not disturb me.  Please stay.

Having trouble sleeping?

ICHABOD

May I ask... why do you cover your

book that way?

KATRINA

You pay great attention to small

things.  I hide these as I hide all

my books.  Father would not approve,

lest it were the Bible.

ICHABOD

I, um... I have something to show you,

if you have a moment.

KATRINA

These are strange... may I?

KATRINA

These scars.  How did you get them?

ICHABOD

I have had them since childhood.  I

cannot remember what from.

KATRINA

It would be interesting to find out.

ICHABOD

Here it is.  A bird on one side.

His cage on the other.  Now,

stare at it.

(spinning it)

The bird seems to be in his cage.

KATRINA

Yes, he does.  May I try?

ICHABOD

He only appears to be inside the

cage.  The point being...

KATRINA

You made this, and the drawings?

ICHABOD

Yes, but listen.  The illusion is

easily explained.  The eye retains

each image, till they combine.  And

yet, some would call this toy magic.

KATRINA

Don't you see why?  Look closely a

moment.  Put your intellect aside.

(spinning it)

Can't you see what is inexplicable?

KATRINA

Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep

it at least?

ICHABOD

If you want.  But...

KATRINA

Then, I also have a gift for you.

True magic which even you will not

be able to deny.

ICHABOD

Thank you.  No.  Here...

KATRINA

I insist that you have it.

ICHABOD

(resigned, leaving)

Very well.  But, it will only sit

gathering dust.

KATRINA

That would be a pity.  Those words

might show you something you've never

seen before.

PHILIPSE

Not more than a year ago, a mob hung

a man for stealing a horse.  For

stealing a horse!  And, you dig up

our dead.

ICHABOD

Are you saying I should be frightened?

Is this a message passed on from

Clergyman Steenwyck?

PHILIPSE

We are farmers here, not lawyers or

bankers, or even constables.  Every

penny we earn comes from what we

send down the Hudson.

ICHABOD

I know it.

YOUNG MASBATH

Um.... excuse me, sirs...

PHILIPSE

(still to Ichabod)

Because of the Horseman, our migrant

workers flee for their lives.  There

is a danger that our crops will rot.

So, if you are going to help us, you

stop the Horseman.  That is your

task... to kill an undead thing.

ICHABOD

Listen to what you say....

PHILIPSE

No, you listen!  You may think we are

a pack of superstitious dullards...

ICHABOD

At times I do.

YOUNG MASBATH

Sirs... please!

PHILIPSE

What will it take for you to realize

this is no laughing matter?

PHILIPSE

Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...

ICHABOD

Philipse!

LADY VAN TASSEL

(to Young Masbath)

Has he not come out at all?

MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)

Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.

YOUNG ICHABOD

No... mother... no... !

FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)

The night of the great storm, I saw

her cross my windows.

THIRD MAN

You are certain it was she?

FREAKISH WOMAN

In the lighting, I did see her.

(points)

Her.  Lady Crane...

FREAKISH WOMAN

I will never forget.  The next moment,

I found my infant dead... with the

blood welt on his breast.

FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)

The night of the great storm, I saw

her cross my windows.

MOTHER

Don't be afraid...

KATRINA (o.s.)

Constable Crane?

KATRINA

Are you hungry?

KATRINA

You promised justice.

ICHABOD

If these are the random stalkings of

a monster, what good am I?

KATRINA

People have put their trust in you.

ICHABOD

They have done nothing of the sort.

KATRINA

Won't they still have that justice?

(patience waning)

Or, was it a vain promise?

YOUNG MASBATH

Constable Crane... something has

happened.

BROM (o.s.)

We do not need you, Constable...

BROM

The men who did this have been taken.

We do not need you here.

ONE FILTHY MAN

You should thank us.  The killings

will end.  We saved you all!

BROM

They spend two days in chains.

ICHABOD

Two days... ?  For murder?

FATHER STEENWYCK

For poaching.  Or, would you remake

our laws now that Magistrate Philipse

has given up the ghost?

ICHABOD

Does that look like an animal hanging?

BROM

Looks like an Indian.

ICHABOD

Wait.  Give me a moment...

ICHABOD

The Lenape Indian had much to tell

once I opened his mouth.

YOUNG MASBATH

How could he?

ICHABOD

His teeth.  Someone had cut them and

chipped off rotten pieces far back

in his mouth.  The Lenape could not

have done that for himself.

(closes his journal)

Someone out there cared for him.

YOUNG MASBATH

Where are we going?

ICHABOD

Up.

ICHABOD

What is it?

YOUNG MASBATH

It's payment day.  Loan monies are

given to Baltus the last day each

month.  Almost everyone borrows...

for tools or to hire workers.

ICHABOD

(points)

Out there.  What do you see?

YOUNG MASBATH

The Western Woods.

ICHABOD

Look again.

YOUNG MASBATH

Smoke.  Chimney smoke.

ICHABOD

Are you familiar with magnets?

YOUNG MASBATH

What kind of nuts?

ICHABOD

Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch

here.

YOUNG MASBATH

It's spectacular.

ICHABOD

(smiles, pause)

Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.

YOUNG MASBATH

No, I couldn't...

ICHABOD

I have others.  All I need is this.

YOUNG MASBATH

Thank you.

ICHABOD

(nods, almost shy)

Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to

business.

ICHABOD

If the Western Woods are truly the

Devil's Glen, we will see for

ourselves.

YOUNG MASBATH

(uneasy)

Father said witches live there.

ICHABOD

Witches do not exist.  However...

ICHABOD

Not long ago, I would have said the

same for Headless Horseman.

KATRINA (o.s.)

Constable... !

KATRINA

I need to speak with you.  Alone.

KATRINA

Why would you do such a thing?

ICHABOD

No stone may be left unturned.  It

may appear harsh...

KATRINA

I have misjudged you I think.  I did

not imagine you were so cruel.

ICHABOD

You are not regarding it in full.

The Widow Windsor had been run

through by a sword.  I followed the

bloodless wound, a wound whose path

I could not comprehend till I had

seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

KATRINA

What are you on about?

ICHABOD

The child she carried was eight

months grown at least... near to

birthing.  The sword had pierced its

tiny heart exactly.

KATRINA

Must I hear this?

ICHABOD

There was no blind stabbing.  This

singular thrust found its target

omnipotently, as if the Horseman made

certain the unborn child died with

its mother.

KATRINA

And this gives worth to butchery?

ICHABOD

It was not butchery.

KATRINA

What is it then?  Scientific method?

How can any of this matter in the

slightest?

ICHABOD

I have no solution for its meaning

yet, but I could not just ignore it.

KATRINA

Take a lesson from Young Masbath's

desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows

with you to avenge his father's death.

That I understand.  But, what do you

want?

ICHABOD

To avenge his father, and the others.

KATRINA

But, why?  Tell me why.

KATRINA

You falter with your answer because

you strive without putting the whole

of your heart into it.  Can't you see?

You'll bring dignity to the dead even

if you have to chop them into little

pieces to do it.

ICHABOD

(fed up, growing anger)

If it had been surgery on a living

person, done to save that person's

life, you would not question it.  Not

for a moment.  So, let me be the first

to tell you, dear girl... on the other

side of these sheltering mountains, a

whole world has advanced beyond such

plebeian thinking as yours.  And

someday, no matter how much you fear

it, that world will come to roust

Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

ICHABOD

What is it?

YOUNG MASBATH

Listen.

ICHABOD

(listens, looks)

I hear nothing.

YOUNG MASBATH

No crickets or cicadas calling.  No

bird songs.

ICHABOD

We have apparently arrived.

ICHABOD

Pardon.  You did not answer when I

knocked.  Are we intruding?

OLD CRONE

You are from the Hollow?

ICHABOD

In a way, yes.

ICHABOD

The Lenape who lived in these woods...

do you know him?  The Redman?

(uncomfortable wait)

I should tell you... he has been

murdered.

OLD CRONE

Leave me.  You are not welcome here.

YOUNG MASBATH

Were you a friend to the Indian?

(waits)

You should have this... if you were

his friend.

OLD CRONE

You seek remedy against the Horseman?

OLD CRONE

(to Young Masbath)

Go out and keep away, child.

(to Ichabod)

You stay.  Follow with me.

OLD CRONE

I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow

and back.

ICHABOD

The Horseman.  Yes.

OLD CRONE

Sit.

ICHABOD

Can you help?

OLD CRONE

You want to see into the nether world...

I can show you.  Whatever you see, do

not move or speak.  I will hold him.

ICHABOD

What... what are you doing?

OLD CRONE

(turns, furious)

Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

OLD CRONE

He comes now.

ICHABOD

Excuse me... um...

ICHABOD

Are you alright... ?

CREATURE/OLD CRONE

You seek the warrior bathed in

blood... the Headless Horseman.

CREATURE/OLD CRONE

Follow the Indian trail to where the

sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the

dead.

CREATURE/OLD CRONE

Climb down to the Horseman's soulless

place and let loose his silent

shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!

CREATURE/OLD CRONE

He who holds fast the Horseman's

desire will guide his reaping hand.

Catch hold of his desire.

ICHABOD

We are leaving.

YOUNG MASBATH

What happened?

YOUNG MASBATH

Follow the Indian trail to where the

sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.

(looking back)

Maybe we passed it by.

ICHABOD

How could something named "the tree

of the dead" fail to draw attention?

ICHABOD

We should not go much further in

this murk.

YOUNG MASBATH

Should we go back?

ICHABOD

We are far from the Hollow.

(dismounts, troubled)

Loath to say it... better to get our

backs against a tree and stay till

morning.

YOUNG MASBATH

What does it mean... climb down to

the Horseman's soulless place?

ICHABOD

"Let loose his silent shrieking."

Who knows, till we work at it?  I

admit not being anxious to find out.

(pause)

"He who holds the Horseman's desire

will guide his reaping hand."

Whatever the Horseman's desire is,

other than extinguishing lives.

ICHABOD

(to Young Masbath)

Do not move.

MOVING P.O.V.:

low to the ground,

ICHABOD

What God-forsaken hell is this?

ICHABOD

Christ...

FATHER STEENWYCK

You all stand idle, while this man

goes about with a book of secrets and

a bag filled with magic.  You all

stand idle, while the shadow of the

Devil falls over our town.

FATHER STEENWYCK

I say, if you do nothing, you share

in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!

KILLIAN

Listen to me!  Do you want to save

your crops?  Or would you rather see

your farms go to ruin?

FATHER STEENWYCK

How is he saving our farms?  How?

Ichabod Crane has brought into our

midst the soulless, moldering corpse

of a heretic!

ICHABOD

The wound is neither smooth nor

cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds

like a fountain.

ICHABOD

She did not go quietly.

ANGRY MAN

Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...

ICHABOD

What are you doing?

FATHER STEENWYCK

Let her burn!  Let her burn!

KATRINA

Stop this!  Leave them alone!

BROM

Let them go

(pointing)

Are you going to beat an orphaned

child, imbecile?

FATHER STEENWYCK

Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,

Brom Bones?

BROM

Only for the moment.

FATHER STEENWYCK

You side with him in this?

BROM

No.  I agree he has only made matters

worse.  But, that will change, if you

listen.

BROM

Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride

each day and night to watch over the

Hollow.  We will stalk the border of

the Western Woods and haunt the

Horseman for a change, with rifles

like this... and slugs like this...

BROM

Hollowed out and filled with powder.

BROM

Constable Crane is not the only one

who fights with science on his side.

ICHABOD

I fired upon the Horseman and the

bullet did nothing.

BROM

You must have missed your mark.

ICHABOD

I hit him square.

BROM

(to the crowd)

I say... if the Horseman is solid

enough to take the lives of our

people, he's solid enough to feel

this...

FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)

The night of the great storm, I saw

her cross my windows.

FREAKISH WOMAN

In the lightning, I did see her.

(points to Mother)

Her. Lady Crane... I will never

forget it.  The next moment, I found

my infant son was dead, with the

blood welt on his breast.

THIRD MAN

You have heard it.  The blood welt

is the mark of Satan's touch.

YOUNG ICHABOD

She was with me, father.

FATHER

Nothing can be done against them.

YOUNG ICHABOD

She was with me that night.

YOUNG ICHABOD

May I see her?

THIRD MAN

Go home.

YOUNG ICHABOD

May I see my mother?

THIRD MAN

You do not want to be here.  Go home

to your father.

YOUNG ICHABOD

She did not do it... please listen...

THIRD MAN

She is guilty.

YOUNG ICHABOD

No, sir, please... she is innocent...

THIRD MAN

She has confessed.

YOUNG ICHABOD

No.

THIRD MAN

She has admitted to her evil and

signed a written confession.  Do

you know what confession is?

(off Ichabod's nod)

All that is left for you now is to

pray for her soul.

FATHER

We are leaving.

(long pause)

She has gone away.

THIRD MAN (v.o.)

She has confessed.

THIRD MAN (v.o.)

She has admitted to her evil and

signed a written confession.

YOUNG ICHABOD

Mother.

THIRD MAN (v.o.)

Do you know what confession is?

KATRINA

Constable Crane?

ICHABOD

Allow me some time.  I have spent

every hour in the company of others.

I need to be alone.

KATRINA

What troubles you?

KATRINA

The things I said to you before...

I was wrong to say them.

ICHABOD

No, actually, you were not.  Every

word you spoke had truth in it.

KATRINA

What has happened?

ICHABOD

Lady Van Tassel... she is your

stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so

little resemblance.

KATRINA

What?

ICHABOD

She is not your birth mother, is she?

KATRINA

No, but... why do you ask that?

ICHABOD

What happened to your mother?  Is she

still alive?

KATRINA

She died.  Her lungs were diseased...

two years ago.  What is this about?

ICHABOD

Memories have come back.  I had them

forgotten, and wish I could forget

them again... but they are here now.

(pause)

Lord, how I hate this place.

KATRINA

If you want me to go, I will.  Do you

want me to leave?

ICHABOD

I... I do not know.  I no longer know

what I think or what I feel.

KATRINA

Why are you so afraid of that?  Is

there truly such harm in uncertainty?

LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.)

Good morrow, Constable.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Returning to the Western Woods?

ICHABOD

Yes, actually.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Use caution.

ICHABOD

(nods, studies her)

Do you know... I think those are the

first words I have heard from you my

entire time here.

LADY VAN TASSEL

As my husband says, a wife should be

always like an echo, and at the same

time, quite unlike an echo.

(off Ichabod's confusion)

Like an echo, she should speak only

when spoken to, and unlike an echo,

should never try to have the last

word, or, at least that is what he

believes.

BALTUS

Constable... did you notice anything

out of the ordinary during the night?

ICHABOD

Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

BALTUS

Sarah has gone missing... my servant

girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it.

She has joined the migration out of

town.

(to Lady Van Tassel)

What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am

I to starve to death?

ICHABOD

I should be going... good day to you.

YOUNG MASBATH

If the Crone's wound bled hard, that

means she was not killed by the

Hessian.  Someone only tried to make

it look that way.

ICHABOD

You grow sharper by the minute, little

man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin

to prefer your company over all others.

YOUNG MASBATH

Well... I'm one of the few people who

likes you.

ICHABOD

(laughs)

True enough.

YOUNG MASBATH

Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And

why?

ICHABOD

Good questions, deserving answers, of

which we are in short supply.

ICHABOD

Quicken pace.

ICHABOD

Ride on.

ICHABOD

Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed

at your head.

KATRINA

It is only me.

ICHABOD

Katrina.  Why do you follow?

KATRINA

I apologize if I worried you.

ICHABOD

A woman should not be out alone in

these woods.

KATRINA

But, I am not alone, am I?  I only

wished to see what you were up to,

and...

(takes out WHITE ROSE)

To thank you.

ICHABOD

Come along.

YOUNG MASBATH

You were right... it does draw

attention to itself.

ICHABOD

Blood.

KATRINA

What did you say?

YOUNG MASBATH

What is it?

ICHABOD

Stay back.

KATRINA

What are you doing?

ICHABOD

Just... keep where you are.

KATRINA

My God... what has happened?

ICHABOD

He... he tries to take the heads...

they will not pass.

ICHABOD

Must be some sort of gateway.  But,

why this place... ?

YOUNG MASBATH

We should go.

ICHABOD

Why this tree?

ICHABOD

(to himself)

"Climb down to the Horseman's

soulless place."

(to Masbath)

Bring the shovel.

KATRINA

Masbath, we've found it.

ICHABOD

It cannot be true.

ICHABOD

Why is it every grave I open holds

a new mystery inside?

KATRINA

The skull is gone.

ICHABOD

Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.

ICHABOD

This is his silent shrieking... and

his desire, to reclaim his head.

ICHABOD

"He who holds fast the Horseman's

desire will guide his reaping hand."

(pause)

Someone controls the Horseman.

KATRINA (o.s.)

Ichabod!

ICHABOD

His next victim is chosen!

(to Masbath)

Give me distance, then guide her

back to the Hollow.

YOUNG MASBATH

Constable!

THOMAS

May I be excused, father?

KILLIAN

Do you deserve to be?

THIRD MAN

(shyly)

I think so.

KILLIAN

(smiles)

Then, go.

BETH

Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas

bad habits.

KILLIAN

I am a bad habit.  There's nothing

for it.

BETH

(kisses him)

No one knows better than I.

BETH

What are you doing there?

THOMAS

Spiders.

KILLIAN

Beth...

KILLIAN

Beth... run!

KILLIAN (o.s.)

(from kitchen)

Get out!

BETH

Don't let him get you.

THOMAS

Mommy...

BETH

You hide now... go...

ICHABOD

For what it's worth...

BROM

We cannot win this.

BROM

There...

BROM

Go to the front and guide it.

BROM

Let's see him catch us now.

ICHABOD

Look.

BROM

We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.

BROM

My Christ...

ICHABOD'S P.O.V.

-- FROM THE WATER

KATRINA

Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Doctor, he is awake.

ICHABOD

(barely a voice)

What... what are you doing... ?

KATRINA

I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

Keep still, Constable.  You were

half-drowned when they found you.

ICHABOD

... Brom Bones...

DOCTOR LANCASTER

He is dead.  You would be also, if

your wound had not somehow shut.

ICHABOD

Bring Young Masbath here.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

You need to sleep.

ICHABOD

Bring him.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

You need rest.

YOUNG MASBATH

Someone left last night.  Looked

like they headed to the square, but

I lost them in the forest.

ICHABOD

Man or woman?

YOUNG MASBATH

All I saw was their lantern.

ICHABOD

Business, best hidden is hidden best

at night.

YOUNG MASBATH

If someone has the Horseman's skull...

if they control the Horseman, then why

haven't they sent him for your head

yet?

ICHABOD

Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.

It is perfection for our murderer if I

return to New York City with nothing

more than tales of a galloping ghoul.

(pause)

We must uncover the reason these

victims were targeted.  What was taken

from them... other than their lives?

Who benefits by their deaths?

ICHABOD

Damn it.

YOUNG MASBATH

I'll get it.

ICHABOD

Wait...

YOUNG MASBATH

(whispers)

Who did this?

ICHABOD

Panic has set in.

ICHABOD

Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

ICHABOD

Do you have these persons' wills?

HARDENBROOK

I have everything... last testaments...

birth certificates, death certificates...

deeds.

ICHABOD

Yes, sir... but, do you have these?

HARDENBROOK

Certainly... certainly.

ICHABOD

May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?

HARDENBROOK

Hmm?  See them?

ICHABOD

May we look at them now?

HARDENBROOK

Of course.  You want them... it shall

not take long.  Wait here.

ICHABOD

Maybe you should take this.

HARDENBROOK

A fine idea.

YOUNG MASBATH

What good is this?

ICHABOD

To discover what might have been taken

from those who died, it will help to

know what was there that could be

taken in the first place.

HARDENBROOK

Damn... damn... damn...

ICHABOD

Master Hardenbrook...

ICHABOD

Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?

HARDENBROOK

Well... that might be... helpful.

YOUNG MASBATH

My father had farm land.  It was the

only thing we owned of any value.

ICHABOD

(still reading)

And it now belongs to you, according

to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

YOUNG MASBATH

Yes.

ICHABOD

Then look here at your father's will,

and tell me why you are not listed.

ICHABOD

Van Garrett had denoted his elder son

in his last wishes; the same son

murdered along with him.  But Van

Garrett's wife and two infant children

are not written... and they were spared.

(picks up another will)

Do you see?  Philipse had no family to

bestow his farm to.  But, here...

(picks up another)

The Widow Windsor was listed on her

late husband's will.  After her

inheritance, she amended the document

to include her bastard child.  This is

why the Horseman made absolutely

certain to impale the unborn descendant.

ICHABOD

Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that

the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

YOUNG MASBATH

But, if the farm is not mine, who stole

it away?

ICHABOD

No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has

gone intestate.

YOUNG MASBATH

In test... what?

ICHABOD

Intestate.  Your farm... all the

farms... they belong to no one.

YOUNG MASBATH

What does it mean?

ICHABOD

Often in such cases, property which

has gone intestate legally passes to

whomever the deceased was indebted to.

And, who in this town is owed a great

many debts?

YOUNG MASBATH

(realization)

Baltus Van Tassel.

ICHABOD

Did your father take a loan?

YOUNG MASBATH

Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.

ICHABOD

Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to

discover who moves about the Van Tassel

house after dark... all we need is a

candle.

KATRINA (o.s.)

(from outside door)

Constable... are you there?

(long pause)

Ichabod?

ICHABOD

Midnight seems an appropriate time.

ICHABOD

(whispering)

They are alphabetical.

YOUNG MASBATH

There is no Masbath here.  My father's

loan papers are missing.

ICHABOD

(regarding his documents)

There are none for Magistrate Philipse

either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter,

Thomas" "Pos, William."

ICHABOD

Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room

and bolt the door till I return.

YOUNG MASBATH

I was getting worried.  Who was it?

ICHABOD

Lady Van Tassel.

YOUNG MASBATH

What was she doing?

ICHABOD

Something I really wish I had not seen.

Never mind it.  Did you find the

victims' loan agreements?

YOUNG MASBATH

No.  They are all missing.

YOUNG MASBATH

There is more, though.  While you were

gone, I could hear someone else

walking through the house.

ICHABOD

(whispers, to himself)

Katrina.

YOUNG MASBATH

Here.

YOUNG MASBATH

There are no other doors.  This is as

far as she could have gone.

ICHABOD

It is nothing.  She comes to read books,

so her father will not find her.

(to convince himself)

It is absolutely nothing.

YOUNG MASBATH

What books?

ICHABOD

Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does

not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be

long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

YOUNG MASBATH

But, sir... what books?  Where are they?

YOUNG MASBATH

If there is a secret place for books...

it could be just as good for the

missing loan agreements.

YOUNG MASBATH

Constable.

YOUNG MASBATH

Fie!  Here they are.

ICHABOD

Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina

is not in her room.

LADY VAN TASSEL

No.  She has gone out.

ICHABOD

Where?

LADY VAN TASSEL

She has taken the last of our grain

to be milled.

(crossing to him)

You do have a background in the

medical arts, don't you, Constable?

ICHABOD

Very little.  I must be going...

LADY VAN TASSEL

Will you look at this?  I cut my hand

this morning: I sewed it myself, but

I am afraid it will go bad.

ICHABOD

It appears well.  It has already

clotted.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Look closer.  Do you have anything to

clean it with?

ICHABOD

It is fine.  Now, I must...

LADY VAN TASSEL

(whispering, close)

I know you saw me.

ICHABOD

What... ?

LADY VAN TASSEL

I know you followed last night.  You

must promise not to tell Baltus...

LADY VAN TASSEL

Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.

BALTUS

Constable, it is urgent that we speak.

BALTUS

Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a

meeting.  This time he is determined

to have you forced out, or worse.

ICHABOD

How did you hear this?

BALTUS

He came to me.  He promised great

violence.  Said I should cast you out

for my own protection.

(troubled pause)

I must speak honestly.  There is no

reason to think he will not meet with

success.

BALTUS

That is the meeting bell already

calling.  With the murder of Killian

and Brom, no one sees any good from

you.  If... if you were to leave...

you might be saving your own life.

ICHABOD

I appreciate your concern.  I thank

you, sir.

YOUNG MASBATH

(mounting his horse)

What now?  Where is she?

ICHABOD

Things have become complicated.

Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead,

find her and bring her to meet me

outside the church.  Find her at all

costs.  Quickly.

FATHER STEENWYCK

You are astonishing, Constable.  Do

you truly think your ridiculous

accusations frighten me?

ICHABOD

Only if I repeat them outside this

room.  And, I will if I must...

(points to doors)

Out there, for all to hear.  Or...

you may speak, as planned.  But, you

tell them you feel compelled to move

on to greener pastures.

FATHER STEENWYCK

No.  You will not run me out.  No one

will believe a word of what you say.

ICHABOD

Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does

not travel alone for long here.

FATHER STEENWYCK

Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free

thinker who does not believe in

divinity.

ICHABOD

It is only important what you are.

An adulterer...

FATHER STEENWYCK

I am the Lord's voice in this town.

ICHABOD

Wallowing in sin and lust...

FATHER STEENWYCK

They need guidance.

ICHABOD

Wallowing quite literally in blood.

FATHER STEENWYCK

(snapping, quaking)

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

ICHABOD

He may.  But, not soon enough for

you, and not on your behalf.

ICHABOD

You are so upset now... and yet, you

seemed in such good spirits last night.

FATHER STEENWYCK

You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

ICHABOD

Climb to the top of the tallest ladder

you can find, Father.  That is the

closest you ever come to God.

FATHER STEENWYCK

My friends... dear friends.  Those of

you still on your farms, I thank you

for coming.

FATHER STEENWYCK

I... I address unfortunate business.

(pause)

I am forced to take my leave from

Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to

do the Lord's work elsewhere.

BALTUS

Hurry along.  The meeting has most

certainly already begun.  We do not

want Steenwyck as our enemy.

KATRINA

What is so urgent?

ICHABOD

Come with me.

KATRINA

Why have I not seen your face for so

long?  You look much better.

ICHABOD

Explain these.  I found them secreted

away in the sewing room.

ICHABOD

Why... why have I scrambled and run

and clawed in all directions, only to

find you against me?

KATRINA

I have been reading your journal.

I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating

to resist.

(pause, ashamed)

I rode to catch up with you at the

Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I

found you though, I overheard what you

were said.

ICHABOD

It was you there?

KATRINA

When... when you spoke father's name

along with accusations, I could not

believe it.  I had to hide these... at

least till I could confront him myself.

ICHABOD

And, what did he say?

KATRINA

He did not do these things.  If you

knew him, you would realize...

ICHABOD

What did he say, Katrina?

KATRINA

I have not been able to face him yet.

ICHABOD

The loans give the land to your father.

It does not matter survivors are still

on their farms.  They could be thrown

off... tomorrow... a year from now.

KATRINA

Yes, I have seen that, and I told you

why I hid them.

ICHABOD

What would you have me believe?

KATRINA

(tiring, angry)

If you think I am behind this, say it.

ICHABOD

The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You

share that name.

KATRINA

Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.

Say it, out and out.

ICHABOD

Katrina...

KATRINA

Speak the words, Constable.  What is

stopping you?  What has happened to your

ability to transcend sentimentality?

KATRINA

Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand

looking as if you still care for me,

after all that you have said.  If I were

to confess, would that ease your

suffering?  Would that make it easier

for you to hate me?!

BALTUS

The Horseman is coming!

BALTUS

Save me...

KATRINA

Father?

BALTUS

He killed her...

BALTUS

The Horseman has killed her.

KATRINA

Father!

BALTUS

Steenwyck!

KATRINA

Father!

BALTUS

Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me!

Let me in!

HUGE FARMER

You'll kill us all!

HUGE FARMER

You're the one the Horseman wants.

Why should we die for you!?

KATRINA

NO!

HUGE FARMER

Get out!

ICHABOD

Stop this!

ICHABOD

The Horseman cannot enter!  It does

not matter who he wants, he cannot

cross the gate!

ONE RIFLEMAN

He's coming back!

HUGE FARMER

We have to save ourselves!

BALTUS

No!  Get away from me!

BALTUS

The next person to lay hands on me

will have a bullet.  Stand off!

KATRINA

Father...

BALTUS

No!  We're safe here.

(points at Ichabod)

You said it.  The Horseman will not

have me.

ICHABOD

(shouting back)

Here!  I have found her...

(looking at corpse,

quiet and miserable)

Here she is.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

It has been a terrible jolt to her

nerves.

ICHABOD

You will stay at her side?

YOUNG MASBATH

She's the one who controlled the

Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?

(no answer)

ICHABOD

I need time for thinking.  Without you

hanging on my coattails for a change.

YOUNG MASBATH

Won't you change your mind, sir?

What can I say to convince you?

ICHABOD

Nothing.  To hell with this place

and all the people here.

YOUNG MASBATH

Why... why are you like this?

ICHABOD

(pause, softening)

You do not know all that has happened.

(pause)

You cannot understand.

ICHABOD

Half now.  Half when we reach the

city.

ICHABOD

This is farewell.

YOUNG MASBATH

Take me with you.  There's nothing

left for me here.

ICHABOD

I cannot.

(bends to Masbath)

You should not worry.

(pause, sorrow)

Van Ripper and his wife will look

after you.  They will.  You will be

well cared for.

ICHABOD

I am sorry.

(quietly)

Forgive me.  I failed you.

YOUNG MASBATH

Do not go, Constable.  How can you

leave?

VAN RIPPER

Sir... this is yours.

(offering something)

The Van Tassel girl said to give it

to you after you were gone.

ICHABOD

Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

VAN RIPPER

What did you say?

ICHABOD

Turn around.  Now!

YOUNG MASBATH

Hello?  Katrina?

ICHABOD

Pardon the intrusion...

ICHABOD

I never examined these bodies.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

... help yourself, you pompous ass.

I will be in bed.

ICHABOD

Would you stay, doctor?  I may need

assistance.

ICHABOD

Stains of blood.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

What of it?

ICHABOD

Jagged flesh.

(pause)

The Horseman did not do this.

ICHABOD

Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

ICHABOD

No clotting or gathering of pus.  No

healing at all.

DOCTOR LANCASTER

What?

ICHABOD

When this cut was made, this person

was already dead.

(stands straight)

This is not Lady Van Tassel.

YOUNG MASBATH

Katrina.

(steps forward)

Is anyone here?

ICHABOD

Open the door.  Open up, damn it!

(pounds, shouting)

Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman

is her puppet.  Please...

HUGE FARMER

Aren't we rid of you?

ICHABOD

Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has

faked her death.  I need able men...

HUGE FARMER

She's dead, and you have gone mad.

ICHABOD

No...

HUGE FARMER

(steps forward)

Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have

ruined this town?  Go!

ICHABOD

Van Ripper... do you have a gun?

VAN RIPPER

Yes.  Here...

ICHABOD

May I see it?

ICHABOD

Get down.  Hurry!

ICHABOD

Sorry.

KATRINA

You... you are alive.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath

dead along with me?

YOUNG MASBATH

She commands the Horseman.

LADY VAN TASSEL

And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't

you say?  It is almost over.

LADY VAN TASSEL

(of the wind)

He rides tonight.

KATRINA

Father saw you die.

LADY VAN TASSEL

He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman

looming over me as I fled.  Things I

wanted him to see.  But, as long as

I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm

me.  Baltus did not stay enough to

see that.  He ran as a coward,

unfettered by my fate.

YOUNG MASBATH

Then, whose body was it... ?

LADY VAN TASSEL

The precious servant girl Sarah.  I

killed her and kept her body hidden,

till I needed it.  And, when I

return to the Hollow tomorrow, my

version of the truth will come to

pass.

(faking meekness)

I mean, there I was that fateful day,

following Baltus into the woods.  I

did not know what he was up to...

where he was going.  I worried for

his safety.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Imagine my surprise, finding him on a

liason with a common servant.  A girl

who had apparently become his secret

love.

KATRINA

No one will believe your lies, whore.

LADY VAN TASSEL

This whore will see your mouth shut

forever very soon.  But... I am not

going to kill you.  Not me...

LADY VAN TASSEL

He will have that honor.

LADY VAN TASSEL

(mock sorrow)

Woe is me... that spying on my husband

in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he

and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.

Oh pity me... so overcome was I that

I wandered in the Western Woods...

dazed... nearly blind from terror.

LADY VAN TASSEL

And, tomorrow is my grand performance,

having barely survived the elements...

(more emoting)

By sheer luck I found my way back to

the Hollow.  But... what do I find

here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter

Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken

her?

LADY VAN TASSEL

(of herself, pleased)

No one will suspect this sad woman who

has been through such an ordeal.  With

only the empty solace of her money and

land to comfort her.

ICHABOD

Katrina!

KATRINA

Murderer!

LADY VAN TASSEL

You've been a naughty girl.

KATRINA

Ichabod!

LADY VAN TASSEL

Little bitch.

KATRINA (o.s.)

(far away)

Ichabod!

KATRINA

Ichabod!

YOUNG MASBATH

Here we are!

LADY VAN TASSEL

Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty

legs will carry you.  It makes no

difference.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Nothing will stop him now!

ICHABOD

Climb up!

YOUNG MASBATH

Lady Van Tassel...

ICHABOD

I know.  Hold on.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Olly-olly oxen-free!

ICHABOD

Christ.

KATRINA

Where are we going?

ICHABOD

I do not know.  Away.

YOUNG MASBATH

Here he comes!

ICHABOD

We might make it to the church.

KATRINA

Masbath... !

ICHABOD

Damn it, boy, get back here!

YOUNG MASBATH

What can we do?

ICHABOD

Take the reins.

ICHABOD

Masbath is right.  We must do something.

KATRINA

Ichabod!

ICHABOD

Keep him off!  Block him!

ICHABOD

Take it!

ICHABOD

Move forward!

ICHABOD

Go!

ICHABOD

Help her.

YOUNG MASBATH

What now?

ICHABOD

I doubt that's the end.

KATRINA

The church.

ICHABOD

He moves too fast.

KATRINA

What was that?

ICHABOD

His horse.

ICHABOD

There...

ICHABOD

He's coming!

ICHABOD

Hurry!

YOUNG MASBATH

It won't hold.

ICHABOD

Get up those stairs.  Open the door to

the roof and wait.

KATRINA

Ichabod...

ICHABOD

Keep climbing.  I will follow...

ICHABOD

(under his breath)

Hopefully.

YOUNG MASBATH

Look out!

KATRINA

Quickly, close it.

ICHABOD

No.

(takes lantern, points)

Get to the crest of the roof and be

ready to jump.

YOUNG MASBATH

Jump?  Jump where?

ICHABOD

The blades will carry us to the ground.

Face front and wait for me.

KATRINA

I... I can't do this.

ICHABOD

We have no choice.

ICHABOD

Be ready...

ICHABOD

Now!

ICHABOD

Okay... come on...

ICHABOD

(as this registers)

Oh, no...

LADY VAN TASSEL

Should have stayed away, Constable.

LADY VAN TASSEL

Keep back, or I kill her.

LADY VAN TASSEL

See him...

LADY VAN TASSEL

You cannot kill what is already dead.

ICHABOD

Let her go!

LADY VAN TASSEL

Yes... yes.  I think I will...

ICHABOD

No!

LADY VAN TASSEL

Say goodbye to her.

ICHABOD

Horseman!

ICHABOD

How are you?

YOUNG MASBATH

Tired.
