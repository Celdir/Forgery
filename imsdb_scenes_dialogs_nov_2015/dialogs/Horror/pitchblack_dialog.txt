"Pitch Black", shooting draft, revised by David Twohy

PITCH BLACK

Screenplay

by

David Twohy

Based on material by Ken and Jim Wheat

Revised First Draft

3/3/98

Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are

seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are

felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling

coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life

when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake

hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates

that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do,

but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters.

For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and

lack of the same.

FRY

Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to

the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,

I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your

E-release...no, red handle, red handle.

I'll get the warm-ups out while --

Particles bore through the cabin

,

OWENS

Why did I fall on you?

FRY

He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was

looking right at him when --

OWENS

I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22

weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to

kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,

I mean, why did I fall

at all

?

FRY

You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

OWENS

Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',

wait.

I'm Owens

. Right?

FRY

Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs

brain cells.

FRY

1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,

shit, we're hemorrhaging air.

Somethin'

took a swipe at us.

OWENS

Just tell me we're still in the shipping

lane. Just show me all those stars, all

those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

A planet rushes up at us

.

That's

why they have gravity.

FRY

Jesus God....

OWENS (V.O.)

They trained you for this, right? Fry?

FRY?

did something right for a change....

OWENS

Fry? What're you doing?

OWENS

Fry?

FRY

Can't get my nose down...too much load

back there....

OWENS

You mean that "load" of passengers?

FRY

So what, we should both go down too?

Out of sheer fucking nobility?

OWENS

Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible

for every one of those --

FRY

Company's not here, is it?

OWENS

When captain went down, you stepped up --

whether you like it or not. Now they

train you for this, so --

FRY

And there wasn't a simulated cockroach

alive within 50 clicks of the simulated

crash site!

That's

how they train you!

On a fucking simulator!

OWENS

Don't touch that switch!

FRY

I'm not dying for them.

She pushes it

. But this time...

FRY

AUDREY

Somethin' went wrong, huh?

Behind him, two chained feet

lower into FRAME

-- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...

JOHNS

One chance and you blew it, Riddick.

Never cease to disappoint me.

FRY (O.S.)

Hey.

JOHNS

Hey, who?

FRY (O.S.)

Hey, me. Over here.

JOHNS

Amazing. I'm Johns.

FRY

Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

FRY

Are there any others, Johns?

OWENS

Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

He's still alive

. The other survivors bungle

VOICES

Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to

the heart...You gotta do it, just do it

fast....

OWENS

Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!

VOICES

You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,

just leave it alone...delirious...doncha

you got some drugs for this poor man....

OWENS

Don't touch that switch!

FRY

Awright, awright, someone...there's

Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of

the cabin...next to....

FRY

Get away. Everybody.

PARIS

Well. Our own little slice of heaven.

IMAM

Please...which way to New Mecca? We must

know the direction in order to pray.

JOHNS

Big talk about a scouting party...

JOHNS (CONT'D)

...then we saw this.

PARIS

Anyone else having breathing problems?

Aside from me?

AUDREY

Like I just ran, or something....

SHAZZA

Feel one lung short. All of us.

PARIS

Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And

with all this dust....

FRY

It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,

not enough oxygen. Might take a few days

to --

ZEKE

So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

FRY

Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a

rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

SHAZZA

Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking

grateful. This beast wasn't made to land

like this. But cripes, you rode it down.

(to others)

C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason

we're alive is a'cuzza her.

FRY

Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start

ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try

to make it last.

AUDREY

Well, is someone coming for us? Or are

we all just gonna die of exposure or

dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even

something worse?

(off their looks)

Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring

me.

SHAZZA

We're worried you'll scare us.

(ushering her away)

Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're

goin' to Taurus Three like we were?

AUDREY

Yeah, but...do we even have enough food

to get there? Or will we have to resort

to cannibalism?

ZEKE

(to Fry)

I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit

further, cap'n. With your permission,

a' course.

"They actually think I'm the captain."

Zeke and the

another

FRY

And him?

JOHNS

Big Evil?

FRY

We just keep him locked up forever?

JOHNS

Be my choice. Already escaped once from

the max-slam facility on --

FRY

I don't need his life story. Is he really

that dangerous?

JOHNS

Only around humans.

FRY

Oh, Christ....

They're losing water

. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an

ZEKE (V.O.)

(shouting)

Well? Is it just the pump?

FRY

Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!

Anything to drink!

PARIS

Mine here....

FRY

S'matter?

JOHNS

Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.

Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

JOHNS

King Tut's tomb....

PARIS

Be surprised what these will fetch in the

Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --

easy, easy. Very rare.

FRY

This is it? Booze?

That's

what you have

to drink?

PARIS

(educating her)

200-year-old single-malt scotch is to

"booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

JOHNS

(cracking a bottle)

A toast to whatever he just said.

PARIS

I'll need a receipt for that.

(to Fry)

For all these.

FRY

Top of my list.

FRY

I don't suppose....

IMAM

One of the Christian habits we

didn't

adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll

have to wait.

JOHNS

For what? There is no water. You

understand that, don't you?

IMAM

All deserts have water, somewhere. God

shall lead us there.

JOHNS

Like we needed another way to die.

JOHNS

What the hell are these?

PARIS

Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern

India. Very rare.

ZEKE

An' this?

PARIS

Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New

Guinea. Very

very

rare, since the tribe's

extinct.

ZEKE

'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these

things, be my guess.

PARIS

Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's

gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

JOHNS

First, because he can only live out there

for so long -- he's gonna come back and

take what we got. Second, for the sheer

thrill of the kill.

"What the hell is it?"

FRY

Imam. We should leave soon. Before

nightfall but while it's cooler.

ZEKE

What, you're goin' off, too?

FRY

Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a

favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They

were good guys who died bad.

SHAZZA

A'course we will.

PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)

Imam...Imam....

A blue star flaring into view

. It's rising as the other suns are

SHAZZA

My bloody oath....

AUDREY

Three suns?

ZEKE

(to Fry)

So much for your nightfall.

PARIS

So much for my cocktail hour.

IMAM

We take this to be a good sign -- a path,

a direction from God.

JOHNS

A very good sign.

(re: blue sun)

That's Riddick's direction. You do

not

wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

FRY

Thought you found his restraints over

there. Toward sunset.

JOHNS

(nodding)

Which means he went toward sunrise.

FRY

So quiet. You get used to the sounds of

the ship, then....

IMAM

You know who Muhammad was?

FRY

Some prophet guy?

IMAM

"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But

he had to travel to the desert -- where

there was quiet -- to hear the words of

God.

FRY

You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

IMAM

(nodding)

Chrislam teaches that once in every

lifetime should there be a great hajj --

a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,

yes, but to know yourself as well.

FRY

Frightening thought.

IMAM

(finishes wrapping her)

We're all on the same hajj now.

FRY

What?

JOHNS

(hands her scope)

Tell me it's not a mirage.

FRY

Trees?

ZEKE (O.S.)

Comfy up there?

PARIS

Amazing how you can do without the

essentials of life -- so long as you have

the luxuries.

ZEKE

Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes

open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up

on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

a blade touches his

throat

.

AUDREY

He'd probably get you right here, right

under the jaw. And you'd never hear him

coming. That's how good Riddick is.

PARIS

Now did you run away from your parents?

Or did they run away from you?

PILGRIMS

Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....

Beyond is a sea of bleached animal

bones

. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,

FRY

Is this whole planet dead?

IMAM

He asks what could have killed so many

great things...

IMAM

Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...

like the elephants of Earth....

"Graveyard? Or

JOHNS

Long time ago. Whatever happened.

PILGRIM #1

Ah....

a face is staring through the combing

. But

Riddick

. Hidden in a sinus cavity.

FRY

Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you

even more.

JOHNS

Probably right.

JOHNS (O.S.)

You know, I woulda played road dog for

these guys. You could've stayed back.

Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,

if we

don't

find water....

"We may not make it back."

FRY (O.S.)

No, no, I wanted to get away.

JOHNS (O.S.)

So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"

quite so ready to leave her ship.

FRY

Better keep moving....

JOHNS

What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching

the switch?

again

she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick

JOHNS (CONT'D)

Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

FRY

Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

JOHNS

You see anybody else here? Just between

you and me.

FRY

During the landing...when things were

at their worst...Owens was at his best.

He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot

dump the passenger cabin.

"Are you shittin' me?"

FRY (O.S.)

So now you know.

JOHNS (O.S.)

Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than

I thought.

JOHNS

Hold up.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

Didn't bite.

FRY

What?

JOHNS

Thought he might be coolin' it in the

boneyard -- could either double-back to

the ship or slip in behind us. So I left

the bottle out as bait.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

But nah. Didn't bite.

we

see that the scotch has been

PILGRIM #1

Captain...captain....

FRY

Wait, wait, wait....

It's a baseball

IMAM

We are not alone here, yes?

JOHNS

Never thought we were.

PILGRIM #1

Assalamoo ahlaykum!

PILGRIM #2

Assalamoo ahlaykum!

JOHNS

Long gone. Whoever they were.

IMAM

Water...water there was here....

PILGRIMS

Allahu Akbar....

IMAM

(translating)

"God is Great," yes?

JOHNS

I'm born-again.

"Who were these people? Why did they

FRY

Lights.

A man standing right outside

.

JOHNS

(through window)

Hey. Don't go too far, huh?

FRY

No darkness. No lights because no

darkness....

FRY (V.O.)

Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

FRY

Allahu Akbar!

The skiff

, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush

PARIS

This now qualifies as the worst fun I've

ever had.

Stop it

.

PARIS

Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

AUDREY (O.S.)

What

?

PARIS

Tell me that was you.

AUDREY

Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?

PARIS

Assailing my fragile sense of security,

that's what.

SHAZZA

What're you goin' on about? She's been

right here for the last....

one

.

SHAZZA

(a quiet probe)

Zeke?

Suddenly he appears

...

AUDREY

No!

TOTAL STRANGER

I thought...my God, I thought I was the

only one who....

His own

. The stranger

PARIS

Oh, Lord....

AUDREY

It was just somebody else. From the

crash. He was just....

ZEKE

Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The

murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....

Riddick in the background

. He stands

FRY

No juice, looks like it's been laid up

for years. But we might be able to

adapt --

JOHNS

Shut up.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

Sorry. Thought I heard something.

FRY

Like what?

JOHNS

Like my pistola.

ZEKE

Now what the bloody hell....

JOHNS

Same crap, different planet, huh?

JOHNS

...I don't play that...I don't play that

so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell

me a better lie....

FRY

Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me

what....

SHAZZA

What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick

animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?

FRY

He used that?

JOHNS

Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

FRY

So why isn't it all bloody?

JOHNS

I assume he licked it clean.

FRY

So where is he?

FRY

Tell me about the sounds. You told them

you heard something right before....

(no response)

If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take

another crack at it -- at your skull.

RIDDICK

'Mean the whispers?

FRY

What whispers?

RIDDICK

The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet

spot -- just to the left of the spine,

fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.

What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,

so I used it to catch a little run-off.

Metallic taste to it, human blood.

Coppery. But if you cut it with

peppermint schnapps, that goes away.

Course, that's more for winter.

Summertime, I take mine straight.

FRY

Why don't we try the truth now?

RIDDICK

All you people are so scared of me --

an' most days, I'd take that as a

compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta

worry about now.

FRY

Show me your eyes.

FRY

Show me

, Riddick.

That's

how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No

FRY

You did this? To yourself?

RIDDICK

Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

FRY

Heard about it. Just never seen it.

RIDDICK

Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?

Slamlight's so dim that you go and get

your eyeballs taken out and shined up --

then you wind up here. Three ass-kick

suns.

(replacing goggles)

Maybe I did do a few people. But not this

one. No ma'am, not this time.

FRY

Then where is he? He's not in the hole.

We looked.

RIDDICK

Look deeper.

JOHNS

I

know

what happened -- he went off on the

guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and

now he's trying to --

FRY

Let's just be sure.

JOHNS

I

am

sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick

belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He

loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you

afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And

you're playing right into --

FRY

We're gonna find the body

, Johns. Christ,

you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?

We gotta go down and find it.

JOHNS

Well, don't ask me to.

FRY

Thought you didn't believe his story.

JOHNS

I don't. But that ground looked none too

stable, and I don't want anyone --

AUDREY

If you're afraid, I'll go.

FRY

Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

JOHNS

(pulling her aside)

Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now

doesn't change what came before -- it's

just stupid.

FRY

What, you think I'm doin' this to prove

something?

JOHNS

You said it, not me. Let's just not let

one bad call lead to another.

FRY

Thanks for the tip, Johns.

"Now get outta my way."

FRY

They're hollow....

There's something here

, something just beyond the cusp of light.

Something shadows across the exit

. It stops her cold.

with a bit of Zeke still in it

.

Something impales the boot out of her hand

, reclaiming it. It

it

? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

FRY

Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!

IMAM

Did you hear....

FRY

I'm over here in the --

FRY

Oh, God....

Something explodes near her head

. Daylight appears, followed by

JOHNS

We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got

you now....

IMAM

The child heard you before any of us could

even....

SHAZZA

Did you find him? You find Zeke?

FRY

(half insane)

...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...

goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't

Riddick. Somethin' else down there that

got Zeke and nearly got --

Her

. She flies back into the spire.

Something's still got the

chain

.

IMAM

One is all?

FRY

For now.

RIDDICK

Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

JOHNS

We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if

I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

RIDDICK

Woof, woof.

JOHNS

Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.

The way it coulda gone and didn't.

RIDDICK

(deaf)

Say that again.

JOHNS

Here's the deal. You work without the

chains, without the bit -- without the

shivs. You help us get off this rock....

RIDDICK

For what? The honor of goin' back to some

asshole of a cell?

JOHNS

Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this

head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as

much as you wanna be free of me.

RIDDICK

You'd cut me loose, Boss?

JOHNS

Only if we both get outta this alive.

And there may be a way.

RIDDICK

(staring at hand)

My recommendation: Do me. Don't take

the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on

your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.

Would if I were you.

JOHNS

If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,

you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

and grabs the

shotgun with his off-hand

. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns

RIDDICK

Want you to remember this moment.

PARIS

(to Johns)

So just like that. Wave your little wand

and he's one of us now.

JOHNS

Didn't say that. But least this way I

don't have to worry about falling asleep

and not wakin' up.

IMAM

Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.

SHAZZA

Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his

forgiveness. Right you are.

IMAM

At least give the man some oxygen....

JOHNS

He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him

be.

AUDREY

So I can talk to him now?

JOHNS/SHAZZA

(in unison)

No

.

PARIS

Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,

entrepreneur.

RIDDICK

(shaking hands)

Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,

murderer.

PARIS

You know, if I owned Hell and this

planet...I believe I'd rent this out and

live in Hell.

PARIS

I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,

but, uh....

JOHNS

Little ratty-ass.

FRY

Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the

electrical adapts.

SHAZZA

Not a star-jumper.

RIDDICK

Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back

up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick

out a thumb. You'll get picked up.

(to Fry)

Right?

"How did he know that?"

FRY

Little help here?

JOHNS

Check those containers for me. See what

we can patch wings with.

FRY

Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.

But we'll need more cells.

JOHNS

How many?

FRY

15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other

ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.

Five total to launch.

JOHNS

25 kilos each, huh?

SHAZZA

Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get

it up and chuggin'.

JOHNS

Do it. And if you need an extra hand,

tap our problem child out....

(looking out)

Where's Riddick?

ROBOT

"...to all intruders. I am the guardian

of this land. I will protect my masters

at all cost. Death to all intruders..."

JOHNS (O.S.)

Missin' the party. C'mon.

RIDDICK

Missin' the party. C'mon.

AUDREY (O.S.)

Talkin' to me?

IMAM

...and for this, our gift of drink, we

give thanks in the name of our Prophet,

Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our

Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his

father, Allah the Compassionate and the

Merciful.

PARIS

(to himself)

The

strangest

religion....

PARIS

Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who

were these people, anyway? Miners?

SHAZZA

Looks like geologists. Advance team,

moves around from rock to rock.

JOHNS

Musta crapped out here, huh?

AUDREY

But why did they leave their ship?

JOHNS

(answering Audrey)

Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.

PARIS

Like an emergency life-raft, right?

SHAZZA

Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take

them off-planet. Long gone.

PARIS

A toast to their ghosts, then....

RIDDICK

Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got

Zeke got them. They're all dead.

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

What, you don't really think they left

with their clothes on the lines? Photos

on the walls?

SHAZZA

Maybe they had weight limits, you don't

know.

RIDDICK

I know you don't uncrate your emergency

ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

JOHNS

Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your

theories on --

FRY

(to Riddick)

So what happened? Where are they, then?

IMAM

Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?

RIDDICK

(to Fry

and

Imam)

Has anyone checked the coring room?

IMAM

Ali

....

IMAM

Ali?

And hatchlings pour out

.

inside

the supply room.

SHAZZA

Why was the door chained up? Why the

bloody hell would they lock themselves in

like that?

JOHNS

Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams

better not be diggin' another grave out

there.

RIDDICK (O.S.)

Other buildings weren't secure...

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.

Thought they'd be safe inside, but...

(looks down shaft)

Someone forget to lock the back door.

SHAZZA

So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you

saw it. You was right there.

SHAZZA (CONT'D)

You were tryin' to kill him too.

RIDDICK

(shrugging,

"not

necessarily"

)

Just wanted his O-2.

(a beat)

Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.

When he shot up that stranger instead.

SHAZZA

Take it.

RIDDICK

(suspicious)

What, it's broken?

SHAZZA

Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

JOHNS

(to Fry)

Let's board this up and get the hell gone.

They seem to stick to the dark, so if we

stick to daylight, should be all --

FRY

60 years ago.

JOHNS

Wha'?

FRY

Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60

years ago. This month.

SHAZZA

Yeah? What's special about that?

FRY

Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....

JOHNS

Are you fuckin' kidding me?

RIDDICK

Not afraid of the dark, are you?

FRY

...need those cells from the crash ship.

Shit, still gotta check out the hull,

patch the wings --

JOHNS

Let's wait on the power cells.

FRY

Wait for what? Until it's so dark we

can't even find our way back to --

JOHNS

We're not sure

when

it happens, so let's

not --

FRY

Get the fucking cells over here

, Johns.

What's the discussion?

JOHNS

Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?

FRY

(jarred)

He can pilot?

JOHNS

Hijacked a prison transport, made a

helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

FRY

(with faint hope)

Okay, maybe that's a

good

thing. Maybe I

can use him to help with --

JOHNS

He also figured out how to kill the pilot,

Fry.

FRY

You said we were going to trust him now.

You said there was a deal.

JOHNS

That's what I said.

FRY

Oh, this is a dangerous game you're

playing, Johns.

JOHNS

May've noticed chains don't work on this

guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he

believes he's goin' free. But if he

stops

believin' --

FRY

You mean, if he learns that you're gonna

royally fuck him over.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells

over at the last possible minute -- when

the wings are ready, when we

know

we're

ready to launch.

FRY

You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.

Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied

to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.

Let him go if that's what it --

JOHNS

He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta

do his bid.

FRY

Dancin' on razor blades here...

JOHNS

I won't give him a chance to grab another

ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.

RIDDICK

Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.

RIDDICK

(looking after Johns)

I'll cut.

He

has the knife.

RIDDICK (O.S.)

Looks like we're a few shy....

Riddick is aboard

, staring at the depleted battery

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

Power cells.

FRY

They're coming.

RIDDICK

Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main

drive yet.

(half-beat)

Strange unless he told you the particulars

of my escape.

FRY

I got the quick-and-ugly version.

RIDDICK

An' now you're worried about a repeat of

history?

FRY

Entered our minds.

RIDDICK

I asked what

you

thought.

FRY

You scare me, Riddick. That's what you

wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,

Can I get back to work now?

RIDDICK

Think Johns is an do-right man? You

think I can trust him to cut me loose?

FRY

Why, what'd you hear?

RIDDICK

Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd

just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth

twice as much alive.

(reading her face)

Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's

got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --

he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.

That's why he won't kill me. The creed is

greed.

FRY

Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on

each other -- no matter how hard you try.

RIDDICK

I don't truly know what's gonna happen

when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I

do know that once the dyin' starts, this

little psycho family of ours is gonna rip

itself apart. So you better find out the

truth. Come nightfall, you better know

exactly who's standing behind you.

RIDDICK

Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask

why your crew-pal had to scream like that

'fore he died.

FRY (O.S.)

Who are you? Really?

FRY (CONT'D)

You're not a real cop, are you? Just some

mercenary who goes around talkin' about

the law like --

JOHNS

I never said I was.

FRY

Never said you were a hype, either.

JOHNS

You have a little caffeine in the morning,

I have a little morphine. So what?

FRY

And here you got two mornings every day.

Wow, were you

born

lucky?

JOHNS

Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

FRY

(lashing)

You

made it a problem when you let Owens

die like that. When you had enough drugs

to knock out a fucking mule-team.

JOHNS

Owens was already dead. His brain just

hadn't caught on to that fact.

FRY

Anything

else

we should know about you,

Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play

games with our lives when --

JOHNS

My first run-in with Riddick. Went for

the sweet-spot and missed. They had to

leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can

feel it, sometimes, pressing against the

cord.

(giving her hands back)

So maybe the care and feeding of my

nerve-endings is my business.

FRY

You coulda helped. And you didn't.

JOHNS

Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.

Right, "captain"?

An arch in the sky

. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

PARIS

What do my eyes see?

FRY

It's starting....

SHAZZA

(to Fry)

If we need anything from the crash ship --

I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's

solar.

FRY

LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!

SHAZZA

We stay together! C'mon!

RIDDICK

Don't wanna miss this.

AUDREY

Lookit. Lookit!

and

each other.

FRY

Don't stop, don't stop....

JOHNS

Jesus, how many can there....

PARIS

Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should

flee.

FRY

Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.

lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

It's like a river of razor blades

.

AUDREY

Tell her to stay there. Stay down.

SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!

FRY

No, no, NO, NO, NO....

and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza

.

FRY

What is it? What's happening?

RIDDICK

Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry

about.

AUDREY

What if...what if she's still out there...

still alive....

JOHNS

Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions

here...but 'member that boneyard? These

just might be the fuckers that killed

every other living thing on this planet,

okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that

door anytime soon are just about zero

squared.

FRY

(agreeing)

I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't

a natural die-off.

IMAM

Quiet, please. Everyone.

AUDREY

(whispering)

Why do they do that? Make that sound?

IMAM

Perhaps the way they see. With sound,

reflecting back.

FRY

(realizing)

Echo-location.

That's

what it is....

behind

them. Lights whip around to find...

"How the fuck could one get in here?"

FRY

Breach in the hull. I dunno.

him

to check it out.

JOHNS

I'd rather piss glass.

RIDDICK

Well, you got the big gauge.

JOHNS

Wanna rag your fat mouth?

AUDREY

Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,

are you still --

IMAM

No, no, no, I do not believe --

JOHNS

C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody

bugfuck with those things. Why don't you

just lose the goddamn....

RIDDICK

Big beads.

JOHNS

(to others)

Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones

that musta --

Something WHOOSHES for his head

, swinging like a scythe. It

JOHNS

Very big beads.

PARIS

Not staying in here another....

FRY

Christ, you don't know what's out there!

PARIS

I know what's in here!

IMAM

Everybody come, this way and we should be

safe. Hurry, please....

RIDDICK

(to Johns)

Can you do sumpin' else with that?

'Sides holding it in my fucking face?

PARIS

Hello, hello?

This is the

open container

, the one where Johns found predators.

"Where's Riddick?"

He's in a stare-down with a predator

.

RIDDICK

Don't. Move.

second

predator appears above them. This

More

blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.

FRY

Imam? Where are they?

IMAM (O.S.)

Hasan?

FRY (O.S.)

Riddick?

more

scared now that the clicking has

RIDDICK

No....

The predators are on him

, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.

third

predator appears above him.

The predator right behind him

. With a similar reaction, the

FRY

Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!

JOHNS

'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

"Sure you did."

Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS

to the floor

, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-

"Christ, he

did

kill one."

FRY

There....

PARIS

Like the light is scalding it.

FRY

It hurts them. Light actually hurts

them....

IMAM

Is that...Hasan?

JOHNS

We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.

FRY

...one cutting torch...one handlight here,

two more in the cabin...I

think

two

more....

PARIS

Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns

well.

FRY

How many bottles?

PARIS

Not sure. Ten?

FRY

Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.

Would they burn?

(reading his face)

If you got a receipt?

PARIS

Possibly.

FRY

Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

JOHNS

Enough for what?

him

to be the mind-reader.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,

I pray you go insane.

FRY

(to others)

We can stick to the plan. If we get four

cells back to the skiff, we're off this

rock.

PARIS

I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an

ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at

night.

FRY

We'll have to carry the cells...drag

them...whatever it takes.

AUDREY

You mean...tonight? With all those things

still out there?

PARIS

Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

JOHNS

Back it up. How long can this last? Few

minutes? Couple hours?

IMAM

I had the impression...from the model...

that the two planets were moving as one.

That there would be...a lasting darkness.

JOHNS

Those suns gotta come back

sometime

. And

if these animals really are phobic about

light, we just sit tight till then.

FRY

I'm sure that's what someone else said.

Locked inside that coring room.

JOHNS

Look, we gotta think about everyone now --

the kid especially. How scared is she

gonna be out there?

FRY

Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke

screen.

JOHNS

Smoke screen for what?

FRY

For your own fear.

JOHNS

(eyes narrowing)

Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two

seconds and let someone else come up with

a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

FRY

How much you weigh, Johns?

JOHNS

What the hell's it matter?

FRY

How much?

JOHNS

79 kilos.

FRY

Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white

meat, and

that's

why you can't come up

with a better plan.

RIDDICK

Think about that reward, Johns.

JOHNS

I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

RIDDICK

How 'bout a cut in your gut?

JOHNS

Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

IMAM

Please...this solves nothing...please....

FRY

(to Audrey)

They're afraid of our light. That means

we don't have to be so afraid of them.

IMAM

And you're certain you can find the way

back? Even in the dark?

FRY

No, I'm not. But

he

can.

FRY

Riddick.

RIDDICK

Looks clear.

A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head

, fleeing the cabin, taking off

JOHNS

Fuck me

. You said "clear."

RIDDICK

Said "looks clear."

JOHNS

Well, what's it look like now?

RIDDICK

(rechecking)

Looks clear.

FRY

Just get the goddamn lights on....

FRY

Ready, Johns.

JOHNS

He'll lead you over the first cliff.

You know that, don't you?

FRY

We're just burnin' light here.

JOHNS

You give him the cells and the ship --

and he will leave you. He will leave you

all out there to die.

FRY

I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn

valuable in your life that you're worried

about losing? Huh? Is there anything at

all? Besides your next hype?

(no response)

Got no right to be so scared. Neither one

of us.

FRY

(to all)

Keep the light going. That's all we have

to do to live through this. Just keep

your light burning.

RIDDICK

(to Fry)

Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want

light on my back -- but not in my eyes.

And check your cuts. These things know

our blood now.

FRY

Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some

kind of deal. Just in case, you know,

this actually --

RIDDICK

(shaking head)

Had it with deals.

FRY

But I just wanted to say --

RIDDICK

Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.

I fuckin' knew better.

"If he doesn't expect to go free...."

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

Been a long time since anyone's trusted

me. That's somethin' right there.

FRY

We can, can't we? Trust you?

RIDDICK

Actually...

(completely genuine)

That's what I been askin' myself.

JOHNS

So you noticed too?

FRY

Riddick.

Riddick

.

FRY

Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't

we still following them?

RIDDICK

Saw something I didn't like.

JOHNS

Such as.

RIDDICK

Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...

but looked like a bunch of those big boys

chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought

we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

"We went around

what

?"

Nearby

FRY

Let's move.

(to Audrey)

Just a detour. He'll get us there.

PARIS

Can we switch?

FRY

What, switch what?

PARIS

I think I twisted my ankle running

backwards like that. And I'm not sure I

can....

(off their stares)

Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to

be alone back there anymore. If you could

just give me a few minutes up front here --

JOHNS

She's the pilot, she should stay close to

the cells.

PARIS

Oh, so I'm disposable?

FRY

I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just

get this train moving!

PARIS

Light, please, need light here....

CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back

.

IMAM

(trembling)

Please...have we been cut? Can someone

tell me if....

Something

slashes him from behind

. It's like the night has claws.

PARIS

Oh, sweet Jesus....

PARIS

Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME

LIGHT OVER HERE!

Paris is gone

, snatched away by a swooping blur.

Audrey

.

FRY

What do you see? Riddick?

RIDDICK

Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.

FRY

Bottle-count.

AUDREY

Four fulls, one half. That mean we're

halfway there? I hope?

FRY

Can we pick up the pace?

"If you think you

Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,

front

of them.

JOHNS

We aren't completely stupid.

FRY

Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in

the fucking --

IMAM

We crossed our own tracks.

JOHNS

He's running us 'round in circles. Look

for yourself. Look!

FRY

Riddick? What the hell are you --

RIDDICK

Listen

.

That's

the SOUND that rides the wind now.

RIDDICK

Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some

time to think.

FRY

Think about what?

JOHNS

About how to kill us and still get these

cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just

doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

RIDDICK

(answering Fry)

About the girl.

FRY

What about her?

RIDDICK

What it's gonna be like when we hit that

canyon. With her bleeding.

JOHNS

What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not

cut.

RIDDICK

(agreeing)

No. She's not.

AUDREY

(confessing)

I didn't want you to leave me there...

back at the ship...that's why I didn't

say anything....

FRY

No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you

shoulda told me sooner.

JOHNS

(finally getting it)

Aw, this can't be happening to me....

RIDDICK

They been nose-open for her ever since we

left. They go off blood.

IMAM

Well...we must keep her close, then.

Here, she'll be safe if we put her

between --

RIDDICK

(scanning)

There is no "safe."

FRY

It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.

JOHNS

Hey,

you're

the one who got me out here,

turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'

now you 'spect me to go back like a

whipped

dog?

FRY

I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?

Now let's just go back to the ship.

JOHNS

I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --

you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out

here.

FRY

Are you fucking high again? Just listen

to --

JOHNS

No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be

afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of

meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say

mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred

meters, after that we're in Skiff City!

So why don't you just butch up, stuff a

cork in that kid, and get --

IMAM

She's the captain, we should listen to --

JOHNS

Listen to her?

Her

? When she was willing

to sacrifice us all?

AUDREY

What's he talkin' about?

JOHNS

During the crash, she --

FRY

(a warning growl)

This does not help us, Johns.

JOHNS

-- she tried to blow the whole fucking

passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

FRY

Just shut up, okay?

JOHNS

-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris

had it right -- we

are

disposable. We're

just walking ghosts to her.

FRY

Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

JOHNS

We're not alive because of her -- we're

alive

in spite

of her.

FRY

We cannot go through there....

JOHNS

(lording)

How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

IMAM

(pushing him back)

Fine, fine, you've made your point. We

can all be so scared as you.

JOHNS

(to all)

Verdict's in. The light moves forward.

JOHNS

Ain't all of us gonna make it.

RIDDICK

Just realized that, huh?

JOHNS

Six of us left. If we could get through

that canyon and lose just one, that'd be

quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,

right?

RIDDICK

Not if I'm the one.

JOHNS

What if you're one of five?

"I'm listening."

AUDREY

What're they doin' up there?

IMAM

Talking about the canyon, I suppose.

How to get us through.

JOHNS

Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no

different than those battlefield doctors

when they have to decide who lives and who

dies. It's called "triage," okay?

RIDDICK

Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

JOHNS

Either way, figure it's something you can

grab onto.

RIDDICK

(doping it out)

Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave

it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket

of chum.

JOHNS

Trawl

with it. There's a cable on the

sled. We can drag the body behind us.

RIDDICK

Nice embellishment.

JOHNS

Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just

keep 'em off our scent.

RIDDICK

(looking back)

So which one caught your eye?

JOHNS

Don' look, don' look, don' look....

FRY

Imam. Slow down.

IMAM

What?

FRY

Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more

space 'tween us and them.

IMAM

I would rather we all stay--

FRY

Do what I say. Please.

RIDDICK

What's her name, anyway?

JOHNS

What do you care?

"I don't."

JOHNS

Then let's not name the Thanksgiving

turkey, okay? I assume you still got a

shiv.

RIDDICK

What, you 'spect

me

to do it?

JOHNS

What's one more to you? Like

this

is the

one that sends you to Hell?

RIDDICK

Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They

oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.

Or forget the museum -- maybe they should

just hang you.

JOHNS

Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the

others off your back.

JOHNS (CONT'D)

Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

RIDDICK

(shakes head)

Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger

piece of chum.

JOHNS

Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

"Like Mr. Johns."

Riddick makes a play for the shotgun

. It BLASTS skyward.

FRY

Bring the light!

AUDREY

What're they doing? What're

we

--

FRY

Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!

RIDDICK

Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's

the only rule.

RIDDICK

Remember that moment?

RIDDICK

Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.

You were one brave fuck, before. Now look

at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass

with your gauge...with your chains....

Johns finds the shotgun

.

"And I'm

still

Billy Bad-ass."

He

Something big coming for him

. Johns BLASTS IT back into the

And crashes into Riddick

. He was just standing in the dark,

RIDDICK

Back to the ship, huh?

FRY

Get out of our way.

RIDDICK

So everybody huddles together till the

lights burn out? Until you can't see

what's eating you? That the big plan?

IMAM

Where's Mr. Johns?

RIDDICK

Which half?

IMAM

You mean....

AUDREY

Gonna lose everybody out here....

RIDDICK

He died fast. And if we got any choice,

that's the way we should all go out.

(to Audrey, softly)

Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.

FRY

How many you see?

RIDDICK

One or two.

FRY

Audrey?

AUDREY

Three full bottles. But almost time to

refill.

FRY

Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,

does it?

RIDDICK

Only see one way. Turn the sled over and

drag it like that, girl down low. Light

up everything we got -- and run through

like dogs on fire.

IMAM

(understanding)

The sled as a shield....

FRY

And what about the cells?

RIDDICK

I'll take those.

FRY

We're just here to carry your light,

aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

RIDDICK

Let's drop back an' boot up.

RIDDICK

What're you doin'?

IMAM

Blessing you like the others.

(off his look)

It's painless.

RIDDICK

And pointless.

IMAM

(a beat)

I see. Well, even if you don't believe

in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

RIDDICK

You

don't

see.

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

'Cuz you don't spend half your life in

lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth

and not believe. And you surely don't

start out in a liquor store trash bin with

an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck

and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe

in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.

IMAM

He will be with us. Nonetheless.

RIDDICK

Give my blessing to the girl. She needs

a spare.

RIDDICK

As fast as you can.

FRY

You sure you can keep --

RIDDICK

As fast as you can.

RIDDICK

Don't look.

RIDDICK

Do

not

look up.

A ceiling of predators

. At the cusp of light, they dive and

RIDDICK

Keep going, keep going, keep going,

keep going!

IMAM

(a muttered mantra)

"So dark the clouds around my way

I cannot see,

But through the darkness I believe

God leadeth me.

I gladly place my hand in His when

all is dim,

And, closing my weary eyes, lean

hard on him...."

FRY

Riddick? RIDDICK?

a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon

.

AUDREY

What? What is it?

RIDDICK

It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!

GO OVER IT!

hands

. Then, taking exception at being walked on...

One "corpse" snaps at her

. Audrey recoils sideways...

FRY

Audrey!

A predator kamikazes onto the shield

, its bone-blades piercing

he catches the

beast under its scythe blades

, blunting the attack. The predator

RIDDICK

Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.

They're one

person short

.

IMAM

Suleiman!

RIDDICK

Get the girl back under. Keep going.

IMAM

SULEIMAN!

RIDDICK

KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears

, thrust back into the light by

One torch dies

-- yet somehow comes back to life.

FRY

Oh, no. No, no, no....

IMAM

Rain.

RIDDICK

So where the hell's God now, huh?

(no answer from Imam)

I'll tell you where! He's up there

PISSING ON ME!

FRY

Riddick? How close?

FRY

Tell me the settlement is right there!

RIDDICK, PLEASE!

RIDDICK

We can't make it.

RIDDICK

Here...hide here....

RIDDICK

Inside...inside....

AUDREY

(a beat)

Why's he still out there?

AUDREY

He's not coming back, is he?

Did Riddick say anything to you?"

Imam

can

see

FRY

There's light in here.

FRY

What are they?

IMAM

Larva....

AUDREY

Glow worms....

FRY

(mind racing)

How many bottles we got? Empty ones?

AUDREY

More, more, we need more....

A blade rushes through the hole

. Imam recoils hard, snatches up

RIDDICK

Strong survival instinct. Admire that in

a woman.

FRY

You're not leaving. Not until we go back

for the others.

FRY (CONT'D)

I promised them we'd go back with more

light. And that's exactly what we're

gonna do..

RIDDICK

Think you've mistaken me for somebody who

gives a fuck.

FRY

What, you're afraid?

RIDDICK

Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was

his

monkey. I only deal in life and

death. All that stuff in between? Some

shade of grey my eyes don't see.

FRY

I trusted you

, Riddick. Goddamn, I

trusted that some part of you wanted to

rejoin the human race.

RIDDICK

Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

FRY

Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.

Just give me more light for them.

FRY

Just come with me!

RIDDICK

Got a better idea. Come with

me

.

RIDDICK (CONT'D)

They're already dead. Get on board.

FRY

You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

RIDDICK

'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't

leave you here. If you believe anything

You'd die for them?

FRY

I would try for them.

RIDDICK

You barely know them.

FRY

weakness, but I'm sorry -- I

steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...

almost there...we're almost --

RIDDICK

Not for me....

RIDDICK

Probably okay to talk to me now.

AUDREY

Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'

away when this whole thing started.

(a beat)

Where you goin'?

RIDDICK

Not sure. I was just runnin' away when

this whole thing....

RIDDICK

Might interest you....
