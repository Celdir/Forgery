GIRL (V.O.)

(whispering slowly)

Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest

little guy. Then one day he got sick

and died. My heart was broken. My

whole body hurt.

GIRL (V.O.)

After that, I saw things differently,

everything could be summed up with

three simple words... fuck the world.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's

Halloween monster weekend. I'm Jimmy

Ray and I'll be bringing you the

oldies, the goldies and sometimes

the moldies. The good, the bad and

the uglies straight from the WJRC

vaults.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Hey, kids still trying to decide on

the right costume? Well why not head

on down to Randall's Penny Save

located on Kimball Rd. just off route

1 in Mackin County. Choose from a

wide array of ghosts and ghouls,

jeepers and creepers...

(scary sound effects)

...everything you need for your

Halloween needs.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Alright let's get back to our monster

music marathon with this classic

called The Teddy Bear's Picnic.

STUCKY

(speaking through

voicebox in his throat)

I... I got back a stack today. Some

nice shots.

(holds up a picture

of June Wilkinson)

See, a good topless June Wilkinson...

unfortunately she personalized it...

(looking at the photo)

to Stucky, love June.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Hmmmmm.

STUCKY

Shit, this ain't worth nothing now

that my name gotten all over it. I

was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie

Cobb.

CAPT. SPAULDING

The retard over at Molly's fruit

stand.

STUCKY

Yeah, he's all hot on her after he

found some of his dad's old nudie

books hidden in the basement. He

keeps 'em taped inside his school

workbook.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Fascinating.

STUCKY

That kid is one horny retard.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Christ, ain't they all. All them

retards wanna do is fuck and eat.

STUCKY

Well, yeah... I think that if you

knew him... I mean if you'd understand

his urges, shit the guy's like forty

or something.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.

STUCKY

Yeah, I guess, you know next to

wacking his weasel his other favorite

thing is twisting sharpened pencils

in the corner of his eyes.

CAPT. SPAULDING

What?

STUCKY

Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just

spins it around next to his eyeball.

CAPT. SPAULDING

I'm sure that ain't the only place

he's sticking those pencils.

STUCKY

Naw, he don't do anything else with

'em, but he did get caught once with

a Planet of the Apes doll hanging

out his asshole.

CAPT. SPAULDING

(laughing)

Goddamn.

STUCKY

Had to take him to the hospital. Kid

had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his

butt, couldn't get it out.

CAPT. SPAULDING

I always loved that mute broad that

Chuck Heston was shacking up with.

STUCKY

Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.

STUCKY

Can I get some stamps off ya?

(slapping down his

money)

Did you fix the toilet yet?

CAPT. SPAULDING

Yes, I did... so don't you go stuffin'

any goddamn paper towels down that

hole. I just snaked the shit out of

that thing.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Ya hear me? You bust that crapper

and I'll beat your ass.

STUCKY

I hear ya.

KARL (O.S.)

All clear. Let's go shopping.

RICH (O.S.)

Right.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Mary fucking Moses. Get the fuck out

of here.

KARL

Hold it, clowney. Keep your paws

where I can see 'em.

RICH

Yeah, don't move or I'll blast a

hole the size of a Kansas City melon

through your ugly-ass Bozo face.

KARL

Go get that other asshole out of the

shitter and drag his ass back in

here.

RICH

Right.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Miserable little cunts with guns. I

ought to jump right over this counter

and bash your fucking balls in.

KARL

Alright Tippy, hand over the cash

box and I might leave your brains

inside your skull.

CAPT. SPAULDING

That's what you bitches need. A

reality check courtesy of my boot in

your ass. That'll be a fucking cash

box you can cry to mamma about.

RICH

Come on, fatboy!

KARL

(screaming)

That's it. I'm gonna count to ten

and you're gonna hand over the cash

or I'm gonna splatter your grease

paint mug across the stateline...

one.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Fuck your mother.

KARL

Two.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Fuck your sister.

RICH

Come on, man. Just shoot him.

STUCKY

(recognizing Rich's

voice)

Hey, I know you. We were in high

school together. Wood shop, right?

...Richard Wick... right?

RICH

Shut up, shut up, shut up!

KARL

Quiet down... three.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Fuck your grandmother.

STUCKY

Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the

shop teacher use'ta call you Little

Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song

we made up to go with that?

RICH

(temper rising)

Shut up!

STUCKY

(singing)

Little Dick Wick, play with his prick

Don't his smell, just make you sick.

CAPT. SPAULDING

And most of all... fuck you!

CAPT. SPAULDING (V.O.)

God damn it, that motherfucker got

blood all over my best clown suit.

JERRY

Alright then, out of all of Charlie's

chicks who do you think is the

hottest?

BILL

I guess if I had to choose I'd say...

mmmmmm... Sandra Good. She seemed

like a nice girl, I mean in a psycho

kind of way.

JERRY

Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd

say Lynette Fromme. She's got that

snooty vibe I know you dig.

BILL

Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.

JERRY

She's pretty cute.

BILL

Yeah but, she reminds me of this

chick that I remember from fourth

grade... called a... shit, what did

we call her?

(thinks for second)

Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when

ever she got called on by Miss

Chumski, this chick would piss in

her pants and start bawling.

JERRY

(laughing)

There always one kid with no bodily

controls. We had this dude, Jeff

Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker

would just sit there puke all over

himself.

BILL

Better than pissing... anyway so,

what's your choice?

JERRY

If we're talking cute... like regular

cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but

cute ain't hot.

BILL

Yeah, no shit.

JERRY

As far a hot... goes I gotta go

with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.

BILL

Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was

pretty hot.

JERRY

Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult

to get some of that... and the best

part is she didn't try to kill the

President or nothing, so that baggage

ain't hanging around.

BILL

I thought she tried to murder a

witness for the prosecution.

JERRY

I'll let it slide, she was only

seventeen.

BILL

Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't

no carry-on shit, that's some heavy

duty Samsonite shit.

JERRY

Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always

nuts.

BILL

Hot has got nothing to do with it.

BILL

(yawning)

Hold on, I've heard this before...

but I can't remember the end.

JERRY

So, the guy goes to Hell and the

devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy

say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great

cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest

Cuban cigars you ever had."

BILL

Shit, we really need to find some

gas.

JERRY

(not listening)

Then the devil asks, "do you drink?"

Guy says, "yeah"... devil say,

"wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks

night, best booze you ever had...

all made from the finest stuff."

BILL

Yeah.

JERRY

Then the devil says, "are you gay?"

Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says,

"Well then, I guess you're gonna

hate Thursdays."

BILL

Oh yeah, I remember now.

JERRY

Yeah, no shit I just told ya.

(looking at magazine)

Hey, you think this place called

Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is

still around? It says, "Where the

Fact is separated from the Fantasy."

BILL

I dunno... we'll ask around as we

get closer. Man, I really don't want

to run out of gas out here in the

middle of Petticoat Junction, man.

JERRY

(sitting up)

Don't panic yourself, way too much

caffeine guy... I see a sign.

(reading the sign)

Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen

and Monsters... cool. Also... fried

chicken and... gasoline... next exit.

BILL

Perfect.

JERRY

I hope this place is cool. We could

use something interesting to liven

up chapter 12.

BILL

I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see

if it's worth thinking about.

JERRY

(salutes)

OK, Boss.

JERRY

Holy crap. You gotta see this place.

It's awesome.

BILL

How awesome?

JERRY

Really fucking awesome.

BILL

Wake up the chicks and bust out the

camera awesome?

JERRY

Hell yeah.

JERRY

Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

JERRY

Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a

kick ass place.

DENISE

Huh?

JERRY

Grab Mary and come inside.

DENISE

Come on sleeping beauty, time to go

to work.

MARY

(half asleep)

Sleeping.

DENISE

Rise and shine.

MARY

(groggy)

No please, let me sit this one out.

DENISE

(removing the blanket)

Let's go. You're the one who wanted

to be a photographer.

MARY

I resign.

DENISE

Too late. You're in for life, let's

move it out Private Shutterbug.

MARY

(opening her eyes)

Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy

folk art. It's so quaint... it's so

primal... it's so crap.

DENISE

Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.

(sarcastic)

...and really who are we to judge

the artistic merit of the tin-can

Mona Lisa?

MARY

Aw, shit...

(exhales deeply)

I gotta pee anyway.

LEWIS

I ain't no rich man, but I see the

truth. You do not have to go to Hell.

You are in Hell. This is Hell. All

American Hell.

(holds up a gun)

...true heaven in my hands... I'm

gonna blow Satan back through the

door to Hell.

BILL

How long have you been running this

place?

CAPT. SPAULDING

How long is a piece of string? Too

God damn long, that's how long.

BILL

No, really.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Shit, I don't remember exactly. I

took over for my Pa just after the

Duke nabbed the Oscar.

BILL

The Duke?

CAPT. SPAULDING

Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head

after that.

BILL

You mean John Wayne?

CAPT. SPAULDING

Hell, boy there some other Duke you

know about?

(rolls up his sleeve

to reveal a John

Wayne tattoo)

A great American.

BILL

Yeah, I was never that big of a

western fan. I like science fiction.

CAPT. SPAULDING

I figured that much. Why the fuck

you asking so many jackass questions

for?

BILL

You see me and my friends are writing

a book on offbeat roadside

attractions. You know all the crazy

shit you see when you drive cross

country.

CAPT. SPAULDING

I don't drive cross country.

BILL

But if you did.

CAPT. SPAULDING

I don't.

BILL

But suppose for a second you did.

CAPT. SPAULDING

(fake hick accent)

Y'all find us country people real

funny like don't ya... well, God

damn pack up the mule and sling me

some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some

schooling.

BILL

No, no I think it's really

interesting.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to

read about all that horse shit anyway.

JERRY

You'd be surprised. Would it be OK

if we took some pictures and included

this place in our book?

CAPT. SPAULDING

Hey, knock yourself silly.

JERRY

You got some really rare stuff here...

(pointing to Aqualina)

...dig your Feegee mermaid.

DENISE

(water running down

her face)

I swear I've aged five years since

this trip started.

MARY

Tell me about it.

DENISE

(takes a paper towel

and wipes her face)

God, I hate falling asleep in the

afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...

(stretches)

...ugh, my back is killing me.

MARY

Yeah, hey how far do you think we

are from your Dad's?

DENISE

I don't know. Couple hours I think.

I've got to call him.

MARY

It will be nice to have a few days

off to regenerate. This trip is fun,

but it's starting to get brutal.

DENISE

Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at

that old stripper lady's place.

Watching her dance around with those

ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.

MARY

I know, that was some crazy shit. I

never in a million years would have

believed it if I hadn't seen it.

DENISE

A decent meal every once in a while

wouldn't hurt either, this road food

is crap.

MARY

If I never eat at another Waffle

House again, I can die a happy girl.

DENISE

Scattered, smothered and covered.

MARY

Exactly... well, I guess a couple

more photos won't kill me.

JERRY

Great, you're back. Let's go. We

already paid for the tickets.

DENISE

Tickets for what?

JERRY

This isn't everything. Get ready for

this... there's a Museum of Murder

and Mayhem.

DENISE

I don't want to see that.

MARY

How about if we skip it and just

hang out here. I can get some great

shots of this stuff.

JERRY

Aw, come on. It will be fun.

DENISE

Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds

fun.

BILL

(smiling)

We'll need pictures of the inside

too.

MARY

Alright, alright. I know... I wanted

to be the photographer.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Anytime this year, people. Alright

line your asses up in front of the

black door. The tour is about to

begin.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Ladies and gentlemen, you are about

to enter a world of darkness. A world

where life and death are meaningless

and pain is God.

(pointing with a cane)

To your left you see the infamous

Albert Fish.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Sadist, masochist, child killer and

most of all importantly cannibal.

Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning

himself with hot pokers, spankings

with nail-studded paddles and

embedding needles in his groin. On

the right, notice the X-ray...

CAPT. SPAULDING

...showing clearly 29 sewing needles

inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish

was executed in 1936 at the age of

65.

CAPT. SPAULDING

To your right. One of our most popular

crazies, the psycho of Plainfield,

Ed Gein.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Murderer, cannibal and momma's little

bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special

pleasure in playing with the dead

bodies of women, especially their

sexual organs. He was quite a handy

little dandy, fashioning lamp shades,

jewelry and human skin suits from

his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered

when the decapitated body of Bernice

Worden was found gutted like a deer,

hanging in his barn.

DISSOLVE TO:

CAPT. SPAULDING

And now I would like to introduce a

local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a.

The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse Nellie

and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Murderer, torturer and most of all

master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern

at Willows State Mental Hospital,

nicknamed Weeping Willows for its

neverending cries of pain, took great

pleasure in control. Through primitive

brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed he

could create a race of superhumans

from the mentally ill, or so the

story goes. His terrifying experiments

continued until 1952.

CAPT. SPAULDING

At which time he was discovered and

turned over to authorities for

observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale

was abducted from his cell by members

of the victims' families. Vigilante

justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was

taken out and hanged. The next day

his body was found to be missing.

Some say he survived, rescued by his

loyal slaves, others say they hung

the wrong man... To this day no sign

of Dr. Satan has ever been discovered.

But who knows? Maybe he lives next

door to you.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Please exit through the door.

MR. WILLIS

Hello...

(brightens up)

...hey Denise... what, what's wrong,

did you break down?

DENISE

No, nothing like that... yeah, we're

gonna be a little late. We stopped

for gas at this place called Capt.

Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville

and it turned into a whole thing, so

we're kind of behind schedule.

MR. WILLIS

Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that

place before. I seem to remember a

crabby old bastard in a crummy clown

suit running the place.

DENISE

Yeah, well he's still here. I think

him and Jerry are fast becoming

buddies, you know Jerry... yeah,

he's gotta see everything... yeah, I

know... thinks there's some unsolved

mystery around every corner.

MR. WILLIS

Well, don't take too long, the kids

are already knocking down the door

demanding their sugar fix... I know,

I know I forgot to mention that

Halloween falls on a school night,

so they're trick or treating

tonight... I got the joint decked

out this year, built a graveyard in

the front yard like when you were a

kid.

DENISE

Hopefully I can move things along

here and make up the lost time by

speeding all the way home... yes,

Dad I'm kidding.

MR. WILLIS

Well, just promise me you'll be

careful... alright, alright see ya

soon... good-bye.

JERRY

I'm gonna go ask him.

MARY

Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all

we're gonna get out of this place

and its starting to rain.

JERRY

Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's

worth the trouble. Hold on for two

seconds.

DENISE

Yeah so... OK, expect us more around

eleven or so. OK yeah, I will...

love you, too, bye.

JERRY

I know it's hard to understand, but

I really want to see this tree.

CAPT. SPAULDING

OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but

I still say it is a waste of time.

JERRY

Great.

MARY

Geez, he never gets tired does he.

DENISE

Never. I swear to God he never sleeps,

he goes to bed after me, wakes up

before me. He's always working on

10.

MARY

Maybe he's a cyborg.

BILL

(wearily, sips his

coffee)

I like sleep.

DENISE

Here he comes.

JERRY

We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good

buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.

MARY

Huh?

DENISE

Ugh, what's that smell?

JERRY

Fried chicken.

(holds up a drumstick)

Anybody want some?

OLD MAN

I don't know where that skunk ape

sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all...

all I know is he eats squirrels to

survive and he had impure relations

with my wife.

WIFE

That's true. He performed lurid acts

upon me and my person while my husband

Russell was a fix'n to our hound

Clarence.

OLD MAN

If I see that thing again... I'm a

gonna kill that skunk ape.

BILL

(off screen)

What does it look like?

WIFE

It looked just like that chubby fella

from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine.

OLD MAN

Hold up the picture.

JERRY

Keep straight on this road here.

BILL

How much further?

JERRY

I'm not exactly sure... it looks

close. Did we pass an abandoned school

bus yet?

BILL

I don't know.

MARY

Let's just skip it. It is probably

nothing anyway.

DENISE

Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see

anything now, it's too dark. Let's

forget it.

JERRY

Come on, we need something like this.

It could be the real deal. It's too

far out of the way to come back to.

BILL

What's that?

JERRY

It's a hitchhiker.

BILL

Way out here?

MARY

Well, don't even think about playing

the good samaritan, there's way too

many psychos wandering loose these

days.

BILL

(looking closer)

It's a girl.

JERRY

Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

DENISE

(sarcastically)

That seems likely.

MARY

Should we stop?

BILL

We can't leave her out here in the

rain... maybe we can just drop her

at the next rest area.

MARY

She looks like a freak.

DENISE

Stick her in the front, if you want

to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.

MARY

She looks like she stinks.

BILL

(imitating Mary)

She looks like she stinks.

JERRY

(makes cat noises)

Cat fight, cat fight.

DENISE

Hardy har, har.

BABY

Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been

standing out there in that toad

strangling rain for like a hundred

million years.

JERRY

Really, that's a long time.

BABY

Yeah, most people just whiz on by

like I was invisible or something...

or else they're creeps who wanna jam

their slimy hands down my pants and

twiddle my naughty-naughty.

JERRY

Yikes.

BABY

Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I

look in and he's got his thing out

waving it around like a drunk monkey.

DENISE

Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest

way for a girl to travel.

BABY

Yeah, but it's fun.

MARY

Sounds like a magical trip through

the heartland.

BILL

Where ya headed?

BABY

Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's

house... yeah, I was out doing this

thing.

BILL

Where's that?

BABY

Couple more miles up this road.

JERRY

Hey, you might know...

(shows her the map)

...you know where this tree is at?

It's an old hanging tree from...

BABY

Yeah, I know where that is, it's

right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's

tree. I can show ya.

JERRY

Really, wow, so it's really a real

thing.

BABY

Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play

there all the time. But, you can't

find it without me. Outsider can't

find no deadwood.

JERRY

Deadwood, is that what it's called?

Cool, will you show us?

BABY

Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know

what word I hate?

JERRY

What?

BABY

Cone.

JERRY

Huh... what cone?

BABY

Any cone, yeah...

(looking out the window)

I hate that word... sounds ugly, I

don't like crumple either.

JERRY

I always hate saying the word cheese,

every time you get your picture

taken... smile, say cheese.

BABY

I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes

make me nervous.

BILL

What about the tree?

BABY

Oh yeah, the tree.

MARY

This is crazy. She don't know nothing.

BABY

Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's

at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute

all bundled up like a cinnamon roll

of Christmas love.

JERRY

Cool.

BILL

Which way?

BABY

Go straight up about another mile...

til we hit Cherrypicker Road and

turn right... it ain't far from there.

NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)

This is WJRC News at the top of the

hour... Investigators in Clairemont

County are no closer to identifying

the body of a young woman found

crucified to the doors of St. Mary's

Church yesterday morning.

MARY

Excuse me, could you not smoke in

here?

NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)

Local police and State Officials

have released this report...

JERRY

What's that?

BILL

I don't know. Looks like some kind

of animal.

MARY

Why are we stopping?

BILL

There's a dog in the road.

DENISE

Honk at him. Scare him.

BILL

(honking horn)

He won't move.

MARY

Go around him.

BILL

There's not enough room.

MARY

Then run him over, he'll move.

BABY

No! He's one of God's creatures, he

can't help it if he's dumb... I'm

just crazy about animals.

MARY

(to Denise)

The animals have got nothing to do

with it.

BILL

Hey, he moved.

MARY

Let's get going before that thing

tries to eat the car or something.

JERRY

That reminds me of a film I saw once

of a guy who got out of his car at

Lion Country Safari to take a picture

of a lion cub and got eaten by the

lions.

BILL

Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always

thought it was bullshit.

JERRY

No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces

while his family watched from the

car. The wife is screaming, the kids

are crying. Some dude in another car

filmed the whole thing.

BABY

I'd like to see that.

MARY

Nice.

JERRY

The lions were totally covered in

this guy's blood... I think they ate

his face off, tore open his rib cage,

pulled his legs off... it was a wild

scene.

BABY

Things like that get a lot bloodier

than ya think.

JERRY

What was that?

BILL

Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

MARY

Don't even say it.

DENISE

You got to be fucking joking.

MARY

God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt

was fucking bullshit.

BILL

OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe

I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out

just yet.

JERRY

I'll help ya.

BILL

(sarcastic)

Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too

much trouble.

BILL

I hope you fixed the spare like I

asked ya.

JERRY

Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't...

um, I can't remember. I think I took

it out to fit the bags and forgot to

put it back.

BILL

Jesus Christ, Jerry.

JERRY

Well, technically I did what ya said.

BILL

You're a real fucking piece of work.

MARY

Can I help you with something?

BABY

I was just wondering.

MARY

Wondering what?

BABY

Are you two gals all funny with each

other?

MARY

What?

BABY

You know... a couple of queers.

MARY

Do you believe this fucking girl?

BABY

(turning her attention

to Mary)

I was just wondering, cause you got

a pissy look about you... like a

real pussy licking bitch.

DENISE

No. No pussy licking here, but thanks

for your concern.

BILL

Well, I got some bad news and some

bad news.

MARY

What?

JERRY

(fake Scottish accent)

Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man.

There's no saving it now.

BILL

And the spare is safely sitting in

Jerry's garage.

DENISE

For fucking sake Jerry, what the

fuck are we gonna do?

MARY

What the hell are you laughing about?

BABY

I just pictured the tire sitting in

a chair watching TV.

MARY

Oh, wonderful.

(muttering to herself)

Fucking psycho.

BILL

I guess I'll try to back it out on

the rim... at least to the main road.

BABY

If you keep going straight you can

get back on the interstate... it's

easier.

MARY

Just back up.

JERRY

I think we should go straight. I

mean we know for a fact there ain't

nothing back that way, right?

BABY

Oh wait! I love this song!

BILL

Fine. I'll go straight.

MARY

What!

BILL

(over the loud music)

Fine! I'll go straight!

BILL

Fuck! We are fucked!

DENISE

Turn that fucking radio off!

DENISE

Now what are we gonna do?

BABY

We can walk to my house from here.

My brother's got a tow truck, he can

come get your car.

MARY

I think I'm going fucking crazy.

DENISE

I can't believe...

BILL

OK, whatever. Let's go get your

brother's truck. Faster we get the

truck, faster we get out of here.

BABY

OK.

JERRY

I'll go. It's my fault.

MARY

You said it, not me.

BILL

Forget it. I'll just go.

MARY

Screw that, no way, I ain't letting

you go by yourself.

BILL

Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just

stay here, no sense everybody getting

drenched.

JERRY

I agree.

BABY

Yeah, it won't take long and besides

you sassy poodle girls will slow us

down.

BILL

Don't worry, I'll be right back.

BABY

Come on.

JERRY

Don't forget the flashlight, it's

pretty dark out there.

BILL

Thanks.

JERRY

No problem.

MISS BUNNY

(bad Marilyn Monroe

imitation)

Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my

Hollywood Revue...

(she giggles)

...where the stars shine forever.

MISS BUNNY

Hi, this is the place where the magic

happens.

MISS BUNNY

(holding up squirrel)

This is Jenny, she is our resident

Ingrid Bergman.

MISS BUNNY

This is Ronald J. Perrywinckle...

our Humphrey Bogart... today we'll

be doing a scene from Casablanca.

HUMPHREY CAT

If that plane leaves the ground and

you're not with him you'll regret

it... maybe not today, maybe not

tomorrow but soon and for the rest

of your life.

INGRID SQUIRREL

But what about us?

HUMPHREY CAT

We'll always have Paris. We didn't

have, we lost it... until you came

to Casablanca. We got it back last

night.

INGRID SQUIRREL

When I said I would never leave you.

HUMPHREY CAT

And you never will.

BILL

How much further?

BABY

Almost there... are you in a hurry

or something?

BILL

Well, yeah, kind of.

DENISE

Fuck, it's freezing.

JERRY

Hey, listen to this... I think this

is related to our Dr. Satan.

DENISE

Oh, yeah.

JERRY

Yeah, in this book there's a chapter

called Self Made Freaks about how

people would mutilate themselves in

order to work in a freak show. It

mostly talks about tattooed people

and wild men of Borneo and shit like

that, but there is one mention of a

single case where a woman was

suspected of having her arms removed

on purpose to become an arm-less

wonder.

DENISE

Yeah, so how does that fit with the

story of four morons with a flat

tire looking for a dead tree?

JERRY

It says, "records show that Ellie

Thompson was born in 1914 of normal

physical stature and lived a life of

normal bearings, until such time

that she was placed in the care of

the Willows State Mental Facility."

DENISE

So.

JERRY

Now she was put in the nuthouse in

1930 at the age of 16.

DENISE

Why?

JERRY

(scanning the book)

Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say,

but she was released sometime in

1937, only to reappear as Ellie

Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says

she, "criss-crossed the United States

constantly in carnivals and freak

shows until her death in 1946."

DENISE

Yeah?

JERRY

These dates perfectly correspond

with the time frame of our beloved

Dr. Satan working at the looney bin.

I'll bet he amputated her arms.

DENISE

So what?

JERRY

I don't know, I just thought it was

interesting.

DENISE

You know what Jerry, who really cares

at this point?

JERRY

I don't...

(to himself)

...I just thought it was weird.

MARY

(bursting in)

God damn it, I must be fucking crazy

to let him go off with that crazy

fucking bitch.

JERRY

Huh?

MARY

That stupid hillbilly slut.

JERRY

Oh, don't blow everything out of

proportion.

MARY

You didn't see the look she threw

me. She's up to something.

DENISE

Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty

fucked shit to us.

JERRY

When?

DENISE

When you were outside with Bill.

MARY

She said we look like pussy lickers

or some shit like that.

DENISE

Yeah, she said we looked queer.

JERRY

Aw, get over it, she's just some

dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough

to be up to nothing... I mean

anything... chicks.

BABY

These are all my dolls. I use to

like to chop their heads off.

BABY

The door's locked. I'll gotta go

around... wait here.

BILL

OK.

BILL

Christ, you scared the shit out of

me.

BABY

Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.

BILL

Is your brother ready to go?

BABY

Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll

wait inside, come on.

BILL

He left!

BABY

Yeah, come on.

MARY

How long has it been?

DENISE

I don't know... about half an hour.

MARY

What was that?

DENISE

What? I didn't hear anything.

MARY

Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.

DENISE

Now... listen.

MARY

I don't hear anything.

DENISE

(whispering)

Shhhhhh, quiet.

MARY

I still don't.

DENISE

Turn on the headlights. See if

anything is out there.

JERRY

What... what!

MARY

Lock the doors... quick, quick.

DENISE

Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.

JERRY

Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm

down! It's the tow truck guy.

MARY

What!

DENISE

Jesus Christ.

MARY

I think I'm gonna have a fucking

heart attack.

JERRY

(Scottish accent)

OK lassies, I think it's time you

get to gripping reality.

MARY

Enough with the stupid voices.

DISSOLVE TO:

GLORIA STUART

Knock again louder.

MELVYN DOUGLAS

I should of thought that was loud

enough to wake the dead... that's an

idea.

RAYMOND MASSEY

What is?

MELVYN DOUGLAS

Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing

the people inside were dead. All

stretched out with the lights quietly

burning about them.

GLORIA STUART

I'm sure it would be very amusing.

BILL

So, you live here alone... I mean

with just your brother?

BABY

(speaking from the

next room)

No. There's a bunch a us 'round

somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'.

She sleeps a lot, now... do you want

marshmallows?

BILL

Um, yeah sure, I guess.

BABY

You sure do a lot of guessing.

BILL

Thank you.

BABY

You're welcome.

BILL

Hey, um...

(pointing to the

mounted animal head

over the fireplace)

...what kind of animal is that?

BABY

A dead one.

BILL

(sipping his drink)

Mmmmm, this is tasty.

BABY

(scoops out some

marshmallow with her

finger)

Ain't the only thing tasty in this

house.

(licks it off)

BILL

I wonder what time it is. Seems kind

of late.

BABY

Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my

bedtime... are you flirting with me?

BILL

What? No, I'm was worried that... I

was just wondering what's taking so

long.

BABY

Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and

killed everbody?

BILL

That's not something to joke about.

BABY

(rolls her eyes)

OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin

ate 'em up.

BILL

Hey, great they're back.

BABY

(sarcastically)

Whoopie fucking doo.

DR. WOLFENSTEIN

(sounds like Wolfman

Jack)

Aaaahooooh, the Doctor is in! Don't

more creature craziness from channel

68's Halloween eve movie marathon.

I'm your host... your ghost host

Aaaaaaahooooooh!

JERRY

(looking at Bill)

Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.

DENISE

Thanks for coming to get us. Little

brother almost scared us to death.

JERRY

(quietly to Bill as

he passes)

Dude, your chick's a little high

strung.

BILL

Mary, I'm sorry but he left without

me. Mary... come on, you don't think

I'd leave you stranded out there.

DENISE

Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell

him we're gonna be late. Can I use

your phone?

DENISE

Excuse me, may I please use your

phone?

MARY

(sarcastically)

Bill, why don't you ask her... she's

your special friend.

MOTHER

Ain't got one.

DENISE

Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a

phone?

MOTHER

No, none. I had one once, back in

'57 maybe... I don't know. Really

ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping

at around here no more.

JERRY

Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck

could drive us to a phone.

MOTHER

His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we

all call him R.J.

JERRY

Oh, right.

MOTHER

What do they call you, sweety?

JERRY

Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise

and Mary.

BILL

Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us

and our car to the nearest garage.

DENISE

I mean obviously we will compensate

you for your troubles.

MOTHER

Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no,

no fuss.

(claps her hands)

Baby... go see what Rufus Jr. is

doing with these nice folks'

automobile.

MOTHER

In the meanwhile please make

yourselves at home.

MOTHER

So, what brings you kids way out

to do for Halloween than wander around

out here in the sticks?

JERRY

Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a

hoedown.

MOTHER

(flirting)

Oh, really...

(puts her hand on

Jerry's knee and

winks)

...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if

you know what I mean... I bet I got

a few moves you ain't never seen.

JERRY

I don't doubt that.

DENISE

No, he's just joking. We don't really

have any plans other than spending

the night at my Dad's house...

(glances at Jerry)

...which is where we were headed

when our car broke down.

MOTHER

That's nice.

DENISE

Yeah, I guess I'll just help him

hand out candy to the trick or

treaters.

JERRY

And I'm gonna help put the razor

blades in the candy apples.

MOTHER

I'll bet you are... you are a naughty

little thing aren't ya.

JERRY

I was just kidding.

MOTHER

Oh, I get it... I guess you think

you're too good for the simple

pleasures of Halloween.

MARY

No, just a little too old.

MOTHER

Oh really, well I hope something

changes your mind some day.

BABY

Tiny's home.

MOTHER

What about R.J.?

BABY

Oh, he was already gone before I

seen him... but Tiny saw him and

said he said he was going out to the

yard to get a new wheel.

BILL

The yard, what's that?

MOTHER

It's an old auto junkyard out in

Baldwin.

DENISE

How long is that gonna take?

MOTHER

He should be back in a couple hours.

MARY

A couple hours!

DENISE

Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

MOTHER

(laughing)

Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even

got a bicycle.

DENISE

How's he get around out here?

BABY

He walks, duh.

MARY

Fucking great.

MOTHER

I know you're my guests and welcome

but I'd please advise you to keep

from cussing while in my house, thank

you.

MARY

Sorry.

MOTHER

Well, even though I know it seems

childish to you all. Tonight is

Halloween eve and it special to us

so you are all invited to stay for

dinner.

DENISE

Thank you.

JERRY

(imitates Elvis)

Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.

MOTHER

(Mother touches Jerry's

shoulder suggestively)

You're a strange one, aren't ya honey.

I think you and me are get on like...

(she thinks for a

second)

...like something real good.

DR. WOLFENSTEIN

There well, who knew there was love

to be found in The Old Dark House.

Coming up next, do not move a muscle,

an artery or a vein as we venture

into another creepy classic... are

you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?

MARY

(holding up the witch

mask)

I hope to Christ she doesn't expect

us to wear these things.

BILL

Whatever it is just do it. The more

we play along the faster we'll get

the hell out of here.

DENISE

Really, now is not the time to make

waves.

JERRY

Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt

to show up.

DENISE

Shhhhhh.

DENISE

You sure you don't need any help in

there?

MOTHER

No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of

host would I be if I put my guests

to this kind of work.

BABY (O.S.)

Ma, Tiny's in.

MOTHER (O.S.)

Go tell him to get your Grandpa.

BABY

(whining)

Ma, I can't, I'm busy getting dressed.

MOTHER

You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't

hear so much.

DENISE

Oh.

MOTHER

Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's

fault. I mean Earl was a good man...

I mean he never hit me or nothing,

but one day he just got up and went

pure devil on us all.

DENISE

What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's

none of my business.

MOTHER

He tried to burn the house down,

said it was possessed by the spirits.

Tiny was sleeping in the basement

where the fire started. I don't think

Earl ever meant to harm us... but

Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were

destroyed and most of his skin.

BILL

Is that why he wears the mask?

MOTHER

Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around

new people, but he'll warm up to

ya... especially the ladies.

JERRY

Great. I thought I felt a certain

attraction between Mary and Tiny

soon as he walked in.

MOTHER

Maybe. He's a real lady killer.

JERRY

Didn't ya think, Mary?

MOTHER

Well, we'll see... the night is young

and so are you... oh well, couple

more minutes.

DENISE

(elbows Jerry)

Don't be such a fucking smart ass.

MARY

Yeah, it's really your fault that

we're stuck in this shithole in the

first place.

JERRY

Oh, don't worry she didn't get

offended by what I said. You two got

to lighten up... right, Bill?

BILL

Whatever, at this point all I care

about is food. I'm starving and I

got a fucking killer headache.

JERRY

Hey, I asked you if you wanted some

chicken.

BILL

Didn't look like chicken to me, more

like fried pussy cat.

JERRY

(shrugs)

Tasted pretty good.

GRAMPA

God damn it, I can do it. I can do

Ummmm.

MOTHER

(hesitates)

Firefly.

JERRY

Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs.

Firefly, do you know anything about

the legend of Dr. Satan?

BILL

Here we go.

MOTHER

(nervously)

Well, I'm not much for local gossip

an this and that, but I've heard it

mentioned in passing over the years

but... I mean folks is queer and

they say things, crazy things you

know what I mean?

GRAMPA

It's all talk, yakty yak, like a

bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ,

Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's

nuts alright...

(starts laughing)

...hey, I hear some genius up north

got a hot line on the Easter Bunny

for ya.

OTIS

I know all about what you want to

know about.

MOTHER

(happy surprise)

Otis! I can't believe you decided to

come down and join us... and you

brought little Wolf. This really is

a special night... all my babies

together.

OTIS

Now, I don't know where you heard

all your little fairy fables about

Dr. Satan but...

BILL

From a Captain Spaulding down at

some museum.

OTIS

(laughing)

That old bitch hog don't know shit.

He tells cute little tattle-tales to

sell his junk, but he don't sell no

Yankee boys no truth.

JERRY

But something happened, right? I

incident, right?

GRAMPA

(mouth full of food)

What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter

for the Daily Asshole?

MOTHER

Grampa... watch the language.

OTIS

I ain't sure that you really need to

know. It's better you go home still

dreaming about your kitty cats and

puppy dogs.

JERRY

I really want to know.

GRAMPA

Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten

him.

OTIS

Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in

the fire if I told ya you'd see

Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to

realize you got a demon sticking out

your ass singing, "Holy Miss Moly, I

got a live one."

DENISE

Can we please change the subject?

GRAMPA

(shouting)

Dinner's over.

(pushes his plate

back and stands up)

Ladies and Germs... it's showtime.

BILL

What's he so excited about?

DENISE

Yeah, showtime for what?

MOTHER

For the show. It's Halloween eve and

time for our show.

JERRY

Oh, you mean on TV.

MOTHER

No, no, no it's so much more special

than that... you'll see, you'll be

the first to ever see. I think this

is something you'll really love.

JERRY

Great.

MOTHER

Please, come in... how many in your

party...

(she counts the heads)

...one, two, three and four... right

this way.

MOTHER

Please be seated.

JERRY

This is way too fucked up for words.

I know the words... fucking psycho

fucking bullshit, that's the words.

BILL

Just grin and bear it.

DENISE

That food...

(holding stomach)

ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.

MARY

(to Bill)

Check this out.

BILL

Well, ya can't complain I never take

BILL

(quietly)

I can't believe what I'm seeing.

JERRY

I know, this is fucking nuts.

MARY

Just sit back and enjoy the show.

GRAMPA (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, straight from

Hey, let me tell ya a story... so

Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal

let's go get some booze and chase

the chickens... fucking Hal says no,

no the old battle axe at home will

break my balls... I gotta get my ass

home.

GRAMPA

So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the

secret. Go home tonight, crawl into

bed, get under the covers and eat

your wife's pussy... I mean jam your

face right in the bush.

DENISE

(quietly)

What are you laughing at?

JERRY

I don't know, I think he's funny.

DENISE

This isn't funny, it's twisted.

GRAMPA

So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts

chomping and licking away at her

pussy, she's screaming and howling...

totally passes out from the

experience.

MARY

Dear God, let this end.

GRAMPA

Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good,

so he goes into the bathroom for a

quick shave...

(pauses)

...suddenly he lets out a horrible

scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

GRAMPA

Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's

wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet

down, you'll wake Grandma!"

GRAMPA

Thank you, you're too kind, too

kind... stay in your seats, coming

up next we got something special for

you men out there.

DENISE

Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but

this is ridiculous.

BILL

(looking at his watch)

Man, it's already ten thirty.

MARY

I'm with Denise, can't we just walk

to someplace, this is getting fucking

stupid.

JERRY

Negative. Shit, we are so deep in

the sticks we could walk for hours

and find zero.

BILL

Yeah, I'd say at this point all we

can do is just wait it out. There's

nothing else.

DENISE

I suppose. I mean they're obviously

all bonkers, but I guess they're

harmless.

MARY

I fucking hope so.

DENISE

You gotta be kidding me. This chick

is wasted.

JERRY

Shhhhhh.

MARY

How much is a person supposed to

stand?

BILL

(motioning for Mary

down)

Quiet.

MARY

Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I

DENISE

Lock the fucking doors.

through the darkness)

Almost there.

JERRY

Jesus, you think she was really gonna

cut you?

MARY

(leaning her forehead

on the window)

Of course she was gonna cut me, she's

takes a breath)

I knew she was crazy from the second

we picked her up.

BABY

You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna

die like a dog!

MARY

Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!

MARY

(hysterical)

Bill!

OTIS

Behold... The Fish-Boy!

MARY

This can't be real, this can't be

OTIS

Oh, it's real... as real as I want

it to be, mamma...

holds it in her face)

...look, see the magic in my brush

strokes.

Fuck you, you fucking freak!

spot in the painting)

right here, needs a little something,

What are you doing?

(squirming)

...no, stop... please, please.

OTIS

You, my dear worm feeder, are about

to become immortalized.

MARY

(screaming)

Noooooooooooo!

WYDELL

(pauses, looks around,

pulls up his belt)

Well, let's go see if the nut that

runs this place can help us.

NAISH

Right.

NAISH

(looking around the

room)

Get a load of all this crap... this

is one sick place.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Whoever's a jerking off on that bell

better be gone when I get out there...

'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Officers, officers what can I do for

you today? I ain't fried up the birds

yet... if that's what you're ring a

ding dinging about.

WYDELL

(pulls a paper from

his pocket)

What I need are some answers.

(unfolds the paper to

reveal a picture of

Denise)

CAPT. SPAULDING

Well, I'll try but I don't know

nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who

likes to mind his own business, if

ya get what I'm saying.

WYDELL

(holds up picture)

You seen this girl? Say... within

the last 24 hours.

CAPT. SPAULDING

(studies the picture)

Yeah, yeah I seen her. Good looking

kid, but not really my type...

(gesturing with his

hands)

...I like meaty, eh?

NAISH

(losing patience)

Hey ass clown, how 'bout some answers.

He ain't interested in your love

life.

WYDELL

Come on, get with the facts.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Hmmmmmmmmm?

WYDELL

What'd you see, who was she with,

where were they going?

CAPT. SPAULDING

Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass

high-rise kids. They were poking

around... asking stupid questions.

NAISH

Questions about what?

CAPT. SPAULDING

This and that, mostly some tired Dr.

Satan bullshit... they got a gander

at the display back there and thought

they could solve the great Deadwoods

mystery.

WYDELL

And...

CAPT. SPAULDING

And I gave 'em directions out there,

up by the old farm row... I figured

what's the harm. Stupid kids probably

going out to piss up a rope and got

themselves turned around backasswards

and got lost as shit.

WYDELL

Is that all... think real hard.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Yeah, they weren't here but a few

minutes, didn't really have time to

get as up close and personal as I do

with most of the assholes that wander

through here.

WYDELL

How's about you give me those same

directions.

CAPT. SPAULDING

Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to

get all True Grit all over my ass...

I'll give'm to ya... you can knock

yourself silly for all I care.

WYDELL

(hands him a note pad)

Enough talk, write.

BABY

(screaming over the

music)

We're gonna have fun tonight, bro.

RUFUS JR.

Yeah, fun.

NAISH

Boss, the way I see it is these kids

probally stop off somewhere, bought

a bunch of booze and are off getting

shitfaced.

WYDELL

I hope you're right, but my guts are

telling me different.

NAISH

Your Spidey senses tingling.

WYDELL

Yeah...

(realizes what he

just said)

...huh, what the hell are you talking

about?

NAISH

You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey

senses... like Spider-man...

(pauses)

...you know, like in the comics.

WYDELL

How old do you think I am? I know

who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to

your point.

NAISH

You know, his senses start tingling...

when he was approaching danger and

shit.

WYDELL

I always favored the Hulk.

NAISH

Hulk was dumb as shit.

WYDELL

Aw, fuck.

NAISH

What.

NAISH

Plates match.

WYDELL

Call the chief... We found 'em.

CASHIER

You all having a Halloween party

tonight?

BABY

Now, what makes you think that?

CASHIER

You all sure are buying a lot of

holy water for two people.

BABY

Yeah, well we like to get fucked up

and do fucked up shit, you know what

I mean?

CASHIER

Yeah, yeah...

(giggling)

...I like to fuck shit up.

BABY

I'll bet you do... how much we owe

ya...

(looks at his name

tag)

...Goober?

CASHIER

(looking down at his

tag)

Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober,

but the guys drew in the other O,

fucking assholes.

BABY

(uninterested)

Great story Goober, how much?

CASHIER

Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five

dollars.

BABY

Keep the change and get yourself a

new name.

CASHIER

Holy crap, thanks!

BABY

Come on, bro. Let's go.

CASHIER

(holding out a flyer)

Hey, wait take this.

BABY

What's this?

CASHIER

A missing girl. I use'ta go to school

with her, she just up and disappeared

some day... real weird.

BABY

Now isn't she a happy little cherub...

oh well

(stuffs it in her

pocket)

...nobody just up and disappears.

RUFUS JR.

(mutters)

Aliens.

BABY

Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens.

HUSTON

What'd we here, Georgie?

WYDELL

A vehicle registered to a William S.

Hudley.

HUSTON

Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves

a field day beating the shit outta

this thing.

WYDELL

Yeah, no mercy here.

HUSTON

Recover any bodies?

WYDELL

Not yet.

HUSTON

(inspecting the car)

Shit, I wonder what these kids did

to bring this much hell down on 'em.

WYDELL

Just in the wrong place at the wrong

time.

HUSTON

That's the understatement of the

year.

WYDELL

Yep, I suppose it is.

NAISH

Hey, I found something.

HUSTON

What'd ya got there?

NAISH

Keys.

HUSTON

Well Christ boy, don't stand there

like a prize dog dick with his

butthole caught up a tree.

NAISH

Huh?

HUSTON

Open up the trunk.

NAISH

Yes, sir.

WYDELL

Toss 'em over here.

WYDELL

(winces)

God damn.

HUSTON

You find something, Georgie?

WYDELL

(disgusted)

Yep, I found something.

DENISE

(hoarse and dry)

Please... Tiny, please. Let me go...

help me.

DENISE

(crying)

Please, God please.

NAISH

You sure this guy's supposed to ride

with us? Seems kind of weird.

WYDELL

(scanning the parking

lot)

Chief said pick him up and take him

with us on our house to house. Guy's

an ex-cop, thinks he can help.

NAISH

Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally

just get in the way.

WYDELL

Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit

on the sidelines and wait when your

own kid's missing... besides, ain't

no such thing as an ex-cop.

NAISH

I guess not.

WYDELL

That must be him.

WYDELL

Mr. Willis?

MR. WILLIS

Yes, sir.

WYDELL

I'm Wydell... this is Naish.

NAISH

Hey.

MR. WILLIS

George Willis...

(to Wydell)

...any leads?

WYDELL

Well, we were on our way out to run

a check on a couple farmhouses out

on the edge of town... closest thing

we got to a lead at this point.

MR. WILLIS

That's it?

WYDELL

Well, all we know is the kids were

headed out to a spot the locals call

Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with

some local legend about this character

everybody calls Dr. Satan.

MR. WILLIS

Dr. Satan?

NAISH

Yeah it's horseshit, just some

boogieman crap that the kids like to

scare each other with.

WYDELL

Anyway, there's not much else out

that way... so, I figure maybe there's

a chance the kids broke down and

found their way over to one of the

farms.

MR. WILLIS

What about the body you found?

WYDELL

(slightly surprised)

Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm,

that's a strange one.

NAISH

Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing

for a couple months, figured for a

runaway.

MR. WILLIS

Fit the profile?

NAISH

No, not really. Good kid, never been

in any trouble.

WYDELL

Her part in this I can't figure...

but I will.

MR. WILLIS

(wipes his brow)

Christ, you know it's crazy...

(gets choked up)

I lived through so many other people's

nightmares, you know. Always cool

and calm, but... but I never thought

I'd be the one needing help, ya know?

NAISH

Don't worry, we'll find her.

WYDELL

Let's hit the road, sooner we get a

move on sooner we'll find her.

GRAMPA

(off screen)

God damn bitch, what the fuck are

you waiting for... Charles Nelson

Reilly don't know shit...

OTIS

(gesturing at the TV

with a knife)

Watch that bitch, she's thinking

about that Klugman bangin' Brett

Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard

Dawson.

OTIS

He's the fucking slick jack Match

Game man, mamma.

GRAMPA

Where do they find these people?

MR. WILLIS

Christ, four kids couldn't just

disappear.

NAISH

No they couldn't, somebody had to

see something.

MR. WILLIS

My Denise is a smart girl, she

wouldn't do anything stupid, and her

boyfriend, he always seemed like a

good kid.

WYDELL

I'm sure there's a logical

explanation.

MR. WILLIS

I pray to God there is.

NAISH

Turn up this road.

MR. WILLIS

Where we headed?

WYDELL

I seem to remember another farm set

way back off the road where the car

was found. I'm not sure if anyone

lives there anymore, but it's worth

a look.

WYDELL

I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You

and Mr. Willis take a look around

the grounds for any sign of anything.

NAISH

Right...

(to Willis)

...come on.

MOTHER

Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops

outside.

OTIS

What! God damn, how many?

GRAMPA

(watching TV)

What? How many?

OTIS

Don't worry about it.

MOTHER

I don't know. I only saw one.

OTIS

I'm sure there's more than that...

fucking pigs always travel in packs...

(handing the gun to

Mother)

...here, take this.

MOTHER

(takes the gun)

What should I do?

OTIS

Go down stairs and play nice... I'm

a gonna go 'round back and handle

things like I always fucking do.

NAISH

Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies

throw anything away?

MR. WILLIS

Shhhh... you hear that?

NAISH

Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming

from?

MR. WILLIS

Over here, inside the smokehouse.

NAISH

(knocking on door)

Anybody in there?

MR. WILLIS

We gotta break it open.

NAISH

I ain't got a warrant.

MR. WILLIS

Tell it to my daughter.

NAISH

(grabbing hold to

help)

Shit... fuck procedure.

MOTHER

(trying to be sexy)

Well hello, officer.

WYDELL

(holding up his badge)

Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing

you this fine afternoon.

MOTHER

Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it

kind of looks like rain, don't ya

think?

WYDELL

My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to

ask you a few questions.

MOTHER

Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you

anything you want to know.

WYDELL

I appreciate your cooperation. I'm

looking for a missing girl...

(holds up picture)

...this girl here, Denise Willis...

have you seen her?

MOTHER

Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen

her, sorry.

WYDELL

Please, could I please come in and

talk to you for a minute? Maybe you

could take a better look at the

picture... might stir up something.

MOTHER

I um... no, I don't think so...

WYDELL

Please, just a minute.

MOTHER

Oh, alright... I guess I can trust

you... being a man of the law and

all.

WYDELL

Thank you.

MOTHER

Oh, you are very welcome... Lord

knows how I love a man in uniform.

NAISH

Jesus Christ.

MR. WILLIS

Call Wydell.

WYDELL

Think... do any of these kids look

familiar in any way?

MOTHER

No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em

before...

(points to the photo

of Bill)

...he looks familiar, is he on TV?

NAISH

Wydell.

WYDELL

Excuse me for a second.

WYDELL

Over.

NAISH

We found one.

NAISH

(into walkie-talkie)

Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over!

NAISH

Fuck, go to the car... call for

backup. Tell 'em officer down.

MR. WILLIS

Right.

OTIS

Hands up, bitch!

OTIS

Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie.

OTIS

Interlock your fingers behind your

head...

(Naish hesitates)

...do it!

OTIS

Kneel.

DR. WOLFENSTEIN

It is midnight my little boils and

ghouls, the witching hour. Time for

all monsters, murderers, maniacs and

madmen to go to work... so lock your

doors and bolt your windows, sit

back and prepare for a fright night

classic...

(lightning crashes)

...The House of Frankenstein.

GRAMPA

(slurred drunken

yelling at the screen)

Get those motherfucker... those high

water bitches and rocketship

daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em.

RUFUS JR.

(shouting through

megaphone)

Show me, show me, show me, show me!

BABY

Drink up, it's party time.

MOTHER

Enjoy your last night...

(looking around)

...where's Otis?

BABY

Oh, he's coming, he got something

real special this year.

RUFUS JR.

Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!

MOTHER

Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come

down with all this hoop-dee-doo

bouncing off the walls. Now, calm

down.

GRAMPA

I shot an elephant in my pajamas

this morning... how he got in my

pajamas I'll never know.

BABY

Grampa, shhhhhhhh.

GRAMPA

Then we tried to remove the tusks,

but they were embedded in so firmly

that we couldn't budge 'em.

MOTHER

(gesturing at Grampa)

Let him finish.

GRAMPA

Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,

but that's entirely irrelephant.

OTIS

(through the megaphone)

I'm the one who brings the Christmas

candy... now tell me

(pauses and raises

his arms)

...Who's your Daddy?

OTIS

I'm the one who brings the devil's

brandy...

(waits)

MOTHER

Who's your Daddy!

OTIS

Yes! I'm the one who beats you when

you're bad...

BABY

Who's your Daddy!

MOTHER

Who's your Daddy!

OTIS

I'm the one who loves you when you're

fucking dead!

OTIS

(imitating Willis)

Now, I say my little darlings...

(rotates the chain to

Mary)

maybe prancing around where you don't

belong ain't such a winner of an

idea...

(slaps Mary across

the face)

OTIS

And you, the great rusher of fools,

what were you after...

(slaps Jerry)

Huh, speak to me...

(slaps him again)

Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan...

everybody got to know about Dr. Satan,

Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest

for fuck sake, he's already got one

foot in the grave and the other's

tap dancing around the edge...

(gets nose to nose

with Jerry)

...well, I can see the disappointment

on your sad little puppy face... so

I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big

favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna

let you meet the old bastard.

GRAMPA

That's a horse's ass alright, I told

you.

OTIS

Baby, roll that old love machine

over here, so this boy can meet his

hero.

OTIS

(lifts his skin mask)

You see it's all true, the boogieman

is real and you found him...

(Jerry stares in shock)

...why so sad? Isn't this what you

begged for? There he is, the living

legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan.

Now, don't get shy on me... ask your

hero some questions, don't blow this

last in a lifetime opportunity.

GRAMPA

Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the

air, the earth... the universe.

MOTHER

Look at the way he lights up... Grampa

just loves meeting his fans.

OTIS

Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I

really think you're the coolest...

you're tops on the playground, cooler

than the Fonzie.

BABY

Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a

question.

BABY

(squeezing Mary's

face, hard)

I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do

you like to kiss on the first date

or is that considered slutty?

GRAMPA

What the fuck are you saying? Who

the hell is talking to me?

MOTHER

Come on, my babies are getting

restless.

RUFUS JR.

Dump in the pit, dump in the pit,

dump in the pit.

OTIS

Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's

time they get what they came here

for.

OTIS

(handing Baby the

lantern)

Hold this. Point it over here.

OTIS

Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.

BABY

Take his gag out, it's more fun with

the screaming.

MOTHER

Yeah, I like the screaming too...

it's so much more exciting.

JERRY

Please don't kill us, please don't

kill us.

BABY

(imitating Jerry)

Please don't kill us, please don't

kill us.

OTIS

Bitch, shut your mouth and get your

shit in the box.

JERRY

Let us go, please... let the girls

go.

BABY

(imitating Jerry)

Let us go, please... let the girls

go.

OTIS

Get in... now!

MOTHER

Wait, I want to say good-bye.

MOTHER

Bye sweety, we could of been great

together.

JERRY

Please, let us go, we won't tell

anybody.

MOTHER

Aw, honey you know I can't do that.

BABY

We won't tell anybody.

OTIS

Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot...

alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking

night.

JERRY

Please, please this is insane. You

can't do this.

OTIS

It is and I can... next.

OTIS

(laughs and raises

his pistol)

Where's she think she's a gonna get

to? She's gonna run all the way home.

BABY

No! Let me get her...

(turns to Mother)

...Ma, Otis is having all the fun...

can I get her?

MOTHER

That's true, Otis... not that we're

having a bad time, but...

OTIS

(rolls his eyes)

Well, go get her.

BABY (O.S.)

There once was a woman who lived

with her daughter in a cabbage garden.

BABY (O.S.)

...along came a rabbit and ate up

all the cabbages. The woman said...

BABY (O.S.)

..."Go into the garden and drive out

the rabbit"...

BABY

"Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...

BABY

..."Come maiden," said the rabbit...

(leans down)

...sit on my tail and go with me to

my rabbit hutch.

DENISE

(hysterical)

We've got get out of here, we got

get out of here.

JERRY

Think, think. Try to open the lid,

try to kick a hole in the wood.

DENISE

(crying)

I can't... I can't move my arms. I

hurt so much.

JERRY

I know, but we can make it out of

here. We can do it.

JERRY

That was good babe, just keep doing

that.

DENISE

That's not me. I didn't... I'm not

doing that.

JERRY

Someone is out there...

(shouting)

...help, we're in here!

DENISE

Help, help us.

DENISE

Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

DENISE

Jerry please answer me.

DENISE

Jerry...

(moving slowly forward)

...is that you?

DENISE

Go, go! Drive... drive!

CAPT. SPAULDING

Hold on, girly, what's the problem?

DENISE

(becoming hysterical)

Murdering... blood and Jerry...

(starts to cry

uncontrollably)

...monsters... I... I... I got away...

CAPT. SPAULDING

Well, I don't see what the fuck you're

getting at, but I got some friends

that live just up this road.

DENISE

(screaming)

No! No, that's it... that house is...

(tries to open the

truck door)

...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!

THE END
