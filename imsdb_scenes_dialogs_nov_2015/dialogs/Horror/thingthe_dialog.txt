ANTARCTICA 1982 WINTER

U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION -- OUTPOST #31

NORRIS

What the fu...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GARRY

Norwegian... Jans Bolen.

FUCHS

Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.

GARRY

How far's that?

FUCHS

'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

GARRY

(surprised)

That far?

GARRY

You catch anything he was saying?

CHILDS

Am I starting to look Norwegian to

you, Bwana?

NORRIS

Yeah. I caught that he wanted the

better part of my ass to come apart.

DR. COPPER

Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It

just grazed you.

BENNINGS

What in the hell were they doing...?

Flying that low... shooting at a

dog... at us...

DR. COPPER

Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows.

CLARK

I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty

deep.

SANCHEZ

It's no go.

BLAIR

Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've

got to report this mess.

SANCHEZ

Look, I haven't been able to reach

shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's

talked to anybody on the whole

continent.

NAULS

Maybe we at war with Norway.

PALMER

Was wondering when "El Capitan" was

going to get a chance to use his pop

gun.

GARRY

How long have they been stationed

there?

FUCHS

Says here about eight weeks.

GARRY

(shaking his head)

That's not enough time for guys to

go bonkers.

NAULS

Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five

minutes is enough to put a man over

down here.

PALMER

Damn straight.

NAULS

I mean Palmer been the way he is

since the first day.

GARRY

How many in their party?

FUCHS

(referring)

Started with six. There'd be four

others left.

DR. COPPER

How do you know?

DR. COPPER

...Guys as crazy as that could have

done a lot of damage to their own

before they got to us.

GARRY

Nothing we can do about that.

DR. COPPER

Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.

GARRY

In this weather?

DR. COPPER

(turns to)

Bennings?

BENNINGS

Winds are going to let up a tad,

next couple of hours.

GARRY

A tad?

BENNINGS

Can't condone it myself. But it is a

short haul. Hour there, hour back.

PALMER

Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift

if...

GARRY

Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a

pain in the ass.

GARRY

(turns)

Norris, go get MacReady.

NORRIS

(grins)

MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered

in till spring.

GARRY

Just go get him.

NORRIS

(stands)

Anyway, he's probably ripped.

VOICE

Bishop to knight four.

MACREADY

Poor little son of a bitch. You're

starting to lose it, aren't you?

VOICE

Pawn takes queen at knight four.

VOICE

Rook to knight six. Check.

MACREADY

...Cheating bastard...

NORRIS

You jerking off or just pissed?

MACREADY

We got any more of those electronic

chess things down in supply?

NORRIS

Get your gear on.

MACREADY

What for?

MACREADY

...Craziness... This

is goddamn insane...

GARRY

...Quit the griping

MacReady. Sooner you're

there -- sooner you're

back.

MACREADY

It's against regulations to go up

this time of year!

DR. COPPER

Screw regulations! Four guys could

be crawling around on their bellies

out there!

MACREADY

So, I don't want to end up crawling

around with them when we go down.

GARRY

Look, if you're going to keep

bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered

to take him up...

MACREADY

What are you talking?! He's had two

months training in those choppers!

PALMER

(defiant)

Four!

MACREADY

(to Bennings)

What is it out there, anyway? Forty-

five knots?

BENNINGS

Sixteen.

MACREADY

(disgusted)

And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen

for how long?! You can't predict

this time of year...

CLARK

Mac's really taking it up, huh?

CUT TO:

DR. COPPER

Anybody there?!

MACREADY

Anybody in there?!

DR. COPPER

We're Americans!

MACREADY

Come to help you!!

MACREADY

Give me a hand.

MACREADY

Hey, Sweden...! You okay?

MACREADY

Sweden?!

DR. COPPER

(more to himself)

My God, what in hell happened here?

MACREADY

Come on, Copper.

MACREADY

Hey, Sweden!!!

DR. COPPER

(irritated)

They're not Swedish, goddamn it,

they're Norwegian, MacRe --

MACREADY

Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.

MACREADY

(wincing)

Holy shit...

DR. COPPER

Christ...

DR. COPPER

...Laboratory.

MACREADY

Portable video unit.

MACREADY

Anything?

DR. COPPER

All in Norwegian.

MACREADY

What are you doing?

DR. COPPER

Could be important work. Might as

well bring it back.

MACREADY

It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm

going to check the last few rooms.

MACREADY (O.S.)

Copper, come here!!

MACREADY

Careful. It's about to go.

DR. COPPER

Watch it.

CUT TO:

GARRY

Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can

hear it all over the camp!

NAULS

Oui, Bwana. Can do.

SANCHEZ

Hey, man...!

GARRY

You reach anybody yet?

SANCHEZ

We're a thousand miles from anybody

else, man. It's going to get a hell

of a lot worse before it gets better.

GARRY

Well, stick to it.

MAN'S VOICE

Hello boy.

CUT TO:

CHILDS

How my brothers and sister doing

today? Doin' fine.

CHILDS

What say to some nice Al Green for

my babies, huh?

CHILDS

What you...? You get the hell on out

of here.

CHILDS

...Comin' in here... goin' to urinate

on my babies.

PALMER

Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn

dog?

(bangs wrench against

pipe)

Hey, Clark?!

NORRIS

...Seems they were spending a lot of

time at a place four miles northeast

of their camp.

GARRY

What were they involved in?

MACREADY

Little ice core drilling... some

seismology... glaciology... same old

shit we do.

BENNINGS

How much more of this crap is there?

DR. COPPER

About nine more hours.

BENNINGS

We can't learn anything from this.

DR. COPPER

Probably right.

DR. COPPER

MacReady and I were listening to

some of these cassettes on the way

back.

(somberly)

Like you gentlemen to hear it.

BENNINGS

What do you want from us?

MACREADY

(flat)

Just listen.

DR. COPPER

Goes on like that quite awhile.

(beat)

What do you gentlemen make of it?

GARRY

Could be anything... Men in

isolation... some beef that

snowballed... got out of hand...

NORRIS

Maybe the whole camp got bent...

Something they ate. What about food

poisoning, Doc?

DR. COPPER

Maybe.

DR. COPPER

There's something else we want you

to see.

DR. COPPER

We found this.

DR. COPPER

I know he's pretty badly burned...

but could fire have done this?

DR. COPPER

Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to

help me with autopsies on this one

and the one Garry shot this morning.

BENNINGS

Clark, will you put this mutt with

the others where he belong?!

DR. COPPER

Nothing wrong with this one.

Physiologically, anyway.

(to Blair)

Find anything toxic?

BLAIR

No drugs... alcohol. Nothing.

DR. COPPER

I don't understand.

BLAIR

It's tissue from one of these sinewy

rods.

FUCHS

What in the world kind of cell

structure is this?

BLAIR

That's the point.

DR. COPPER

(tired)

I don't get you, Blair.

BLAIR

I'm not sure it is any kind of cell

structure. Biologically speaking.

DR. COPPER

(sighing)

This really isn't my field, Blair.

Let's wrap for the day.

MACREADY

Decanite...? Thermite charges...?

MACREADY

What in...

MACREADY

Clark.

MACREADY

Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of

it.

CLARK

What's got into...

CLARK

I don't know what the hell's in there,

but it's weird and pissed off,

whatever it is.

CHILDS

Mac wants the what?!

BENNINGS

(at the doorway)

That's what he said. Now! Move!

CLARK

Mac, where are you?

GARRY

What's going on, damn it?

MACREADY

I'm going to shoot.

CLARK

No! Wait!!

MACREADY

Clark? Where are you? Clark!

CHILDS

What's happening?

MACREADY (O.S.)

Childs, you got the torch? You get

your ass in here!!

CHILDS

Where are you?

MACREADY

Torch it over there!

CHILDS

The dogs?

MACREADY

Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!

GARRY

(panic)

We're on fire!

MACREADY

Don't let up, Childs!

GARRY

(to outside)

Extinguishers.

CUT TO:

NAULS

It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's

over.

(beat)

You see.

CLARK

I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw.

NAULS

Right, man. Right.

NORRIS

Here. This is where they were spending

most of their time.

BENNINGS

Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five

knots.

MACREADY

Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

BLAIR

Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?

GARRY

I just can't comprehend any of this.

It was just a dog.

CHILDS

(evenly)

"tweren't no dog, Bwana.

BLAIR

That tape MacReady showed us this

morning...

GARRY

Couldn't make much of it myself.

BLAIR

I've asked him to try and locate the

site. Okay with you?

GARRY

Sure. You think there's a connection?

BLAIR

Maybe.

NORRIS

One of their sites would be directly

over here.

PALMER

Wow...

NORRIS

Magnesium of some type... or some

kind of strange alloy.

(looks out at debris

in disgust)

And those poor dumb bastards had to

go and blow the hell out of it.

MACREADY

So what do you make of it?

NORRIS

You know damn well what we both make

of it.

MACREADY

No chance it could have been some

new kind of test craft?

NORRIS

Seismic activity has been pushing

this are up from way down for a long

time...

(holds up ice sample)

...This ice it was buried in...

It's over a hundred thousand years

old.

CUT TO:

CHILDS

Okay now, Mac, run this by me again.

Thousands of years ago this rocket

ship crashes, right...? And the...

CHILDS

MacReady!

MACREADY

Look, I'm just guessing...

CHILDS

Well, go on.

NAULS

Where's that big ol' steel pot of

mine?! Damn!

MACREADY

...So it crashes, and this guy,

whoever he is, gets thrown out, or

walks out, and ends up freezing.

CHILDS

I just can't believe this voodoo

bullshit. You believe this voodoo

bullshit, Blair?

PALMER

(rambling)

Happens all the time, man. They're

falling out of the skies like flies.

Government knows all about it...

Chariots of the Gods, man... They

practically own South America. I

mean they taught the Incas everything

they knew...

CHILDS

Cool it, Palmer!!

PALMER

Read von Daniken! Have you read von

Daniken? Get your facts straight!

CLARK

Jesus, why would those guys ever

want to leave Norway...?

NAULS

Which one you muthers been tossing

his dirty underwear in the kitchen

trash?!

NAULS

I want my kitchen clean. Germ free!

CHILDS

So, MacReady, come on now. These

Norwegian dudes come by... find him

and dig him up...

MACREADY

Yeah, they dig him up and cart him

back. He gets thawed out, wakes up

and scares the shit out of them. And

they get into one hell of a brawl...

CHILDS

Now how's this motherfucker wake up

after thousands of years in the ice,

huh?

MACREADY

(annoyed)

I don't know how. Because he's

different than we are. Because he's

a space guy. What do you want from

me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

CHILDS

You buy any of this, Blair?

BLAIR

It was here... got to that dog... It

was here in this camp...

GARRY

So...? So what? It's over with.

BENNINGS

(edgy)

Well, isn't it?

BLAIR

Whatever that Norwegian dog was...

It... It was capable of changing its

form...

(indicates their dog)

...when it attacked our dog... it

somehow was able to digest... or...

absorb it... and in the process shaped

its own cells to imitate our dog's

cells exactly...

(holds up gooey dog

leg)

...This for instance isn't dog at

all -- it's imitation... We got to

it before it had time to finish or...

NAULS

Finish what?

BLAIR

...I think the whole process would

have taken an hour... maybe more.

And then I suppose both would have

changed back to dog form.

PALMER

Well, that Thing in the ice sure

weren't no dog.

BLAIR

(impatient)

Of course not... But whatever it was

revived, it... Well, The Thing was

probably disoriented... and realized

it couldn't survive for long in our

atmosphere... But being the incredibly

adaptable creature it was... it tried

to become something that could...

Before the Norwegians killed it...

it somehow got to this dog.

CLARK

What do you mean "got" to the dog?

BLAIR

It was a life form that was able to

imitate and reproduce, whatever it

ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

BLAIR

The concept is staggering. I know...

I... I don't fully understand it

myself.

CHILDS

(skeptically, points)

You're saying... that big muther in

the ice, became the dog.

BLAIR

(nodding)

I think we're talking about an

organism... that could imitate other

life forms... perfectly... It could

have gone on and on... It could have

become one dog... It could have become

as many dogs as it wanted to -- and

without losing any of its original

mass...

NORRIS

You been into Childs' weed, Blair?

BLAIR

Look, I know it's hard to believe...

GARRY

(breaking in)

So what's our problem?

BLAIR

Well... there's still some cell

activity... it's not entirely dead

yet.

CUT TO:

FUCHS (O.S.)

(in violent

protestation)

You can't do this! You can't burn

these remains...

MACREADY

And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs.

(to Childs)

Light it up.

FUCHS

Well, I'm not going to let this

happen...

FUCHS

I just can't believe it... We're

going to go down as the biggest bunch

of assholes in history...

MACREADY

Fuck history. At least we're going

to live to be an old bunch of

assholes.

CUT TO:

BLAIR

(perplexed, bothered)

Clark, did you notice anything strange

about that dog? Just anything at

all? Any little thing?

CLARK

No. Just that he recovered real

quick... That night when I found him

in the rec room, he had already

scraped off his bandage. Before I

put him with the others, I redressed

his wound and noticed it had healed

up real good...

BLAIR

That night?

CLARK

(pets dog vigorously)

Yeah.

BLAIR

What was he doing in the rec room?

CLARK

Well, after I worked on him -- thought

I'd let him rest. Left the room for

a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

BLAIR

Well, where was he? Where did he go?

CLARK

Don't know. Looked for him for a

bit... couldn't find him.

BLAIR

(a long beat)

You're saying he wasn't put into the

kennel until the night?

CLARK

Well... yeah.

BLAIR

How long were you with the dog? Alone,

I mean?

CLARK

Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked

an artery... I don't know... An

hour... hour and a half...

CLARK

What the hell you looking at me like

that for?

BLAIR

Nothing. Nothing at all.

BLAIR

...It could have gotten to somebody...

GARRY

Anybody sick?

BLAIR

No, I... I don't mean infection...

or disease...

GARRY

Any luck yet?

SANCHEZ

Couple seconds of an Argentine disco

station.

GARRY

Well, stick with it. I want you at

it round the clock. We got to get

help in here...

BLAIR

(alarm)

No... No, you can't let anyone in

here... That dog was all over this

camp...

BENNINGS

(to Garry)

Travel-wise, tomorrow may be okay.

But after that some pretty nasty

northeasterly shit's coming in.

FUCHS

...Goddamn fools...

BLAIR

(pleading)

Listen to me, Garry. Please...

GARRY

(to MacReady)

If the weather clears enough before

we reach anybody -- I'm sending you

and Doc up to MacMurdo...

BLAIR

No! You can't let people

leave...

MACREADY

I ain't going anywhere in

anything over forty knots,

Garry...

GARRY

(snapping)

The hell you won't, MacReady!

BLAIR

Don't you understand?! That Thing

didn't want to become a dog...

GARRY

(fed up)

Damn you, Blair! You've already got

everybody half-hysterical around

here.

BLAIR

You can't let anybody leave!

GARRY

I've got six dead Norwegians on my

hands, a burned up flying saucer,

and we've just destroyed the

scientific find of the century. Now

fuck off!

CUT TO:

MACREADY

All set.

MACREADY

To us.

MACREADY

Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm

just a beginner.

CHESS VOICE

Rook takes bishop at Queen four --

Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook

takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate.

MACREADY

Aw shit.

MACREADY

Sorry, hon.

MACREADY

Never any damn ice around here...

MACREADY

Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got

ice... They got ice coming out of

their ears.

MACREADY

What's...

PALMER

Blair. He's gone berserk.

BENNINGS

He's in the radio room. Got a gun.

Beat on Sanchez something fierce.

BLAIR

Anybody interferes, I'll kill!

Nobody's getting in or out of this

camp...

MACREADY

He smashed one of the choppers up

good. Childs, go check the other one

and the tractor.

BLAIR

...You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most

of you don't know what's going on --

but I'm damn well sure some of you

do!

(crunch)

NORRIS

The back window. A couple of us could

maybe surprise him.

MACREADY

Too damn dangerous.

BLAIR

...You think this Thing wants to

become an animal? Dogs can't make it

1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls

to imitate this time of year... No

penguins this far inland... Don't

you understand?! It wanted to become

us!

CHILDS

He got both choppers and the

tractor... I don't know how bad yet.

MACREADY

No, wait a minute.

(to Norris)

The fuse box.

BLAIR

...Can't you see...? If one cell of

this Thing got out it could imitate

every living thing on Earth. Nothing

could stop it! Nothing!

MACREADY

(humoring)

Look Blair, maybe you're right about

this. But we've got to be rational.

We've got to talk this over. I'm

unarmed and I'm coming in.

BLAIR

No, you're not! I don't trust any of

you!

MACREADY

If you're right we've all got to

stick together.

CUT TO:

BLAIR

Why am I here?

DR. COPPER

It's for your own protection, Blair.

MACREADY

And mainly ours.

MACREADY

Leave a bit of an opening so he can

see out.

MACREADY

How you doin', old boy?

BLAIR

(softly)

I don't know who to trust.

MACREADY

(humoring)

Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is

a tough thing to come by these days.

Just trust in the Lord.

BLAIR

(beat)

Watch Clark.

MACREADY

What?

BLAIR

Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't

kennel the dog.

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ

I'll see what I can do. But they

didn't teach me much about fixing

these things.

NORRIS

They didn't teach you much about

working them either.

DR. COPPER

Put this in Blair's juice before you

take him his tray.

CLARK

The dogs...

CUT TO:

GARRY

Doesn't look broken.

CLARK

No. Door was wide open. I know I

latched it.

CLARK

All three of them took off.

DR. COPPER

How long do you suppose they've been

gone?

CLARK

I haven't seen them since their last

feeding. Could be as much as twenty-

four hours.

MACREADY

They couldn't have gotten that far

in this weather.

GARRY

You're not thinking of going after

them, are you?

MACREADY

I am going after them.

NORRIS

What in the hell for? Even if Blair's

right -- they'll just die out there.

No food. They're over a thousand

miles from anything.

PALMER

Chopper aren't going to be ready for

days.

MACREADY

Get these things out of supply and

meet me over by the snowmobiles.

GARRY

You're not going to catch them in

one of those with the start they

got.

MACREADY

Palmer, how long would it take you

to strap those big four-cylinder

carburetors on?

PALMER

(grins)

Oh, I got you. Not too long.

MACREADY

Then get a move on. Childs, come

with me.

GARRY

(shouting after them)

Besides, what are you going to do

when you catch up to them?

BENNINGS

Holy shit.

(hands list to Garry)

Whatever he's going to do, he ain't

fucking around.

CHILDS

I can get maybe another five or six

feet out of it.

MACREADY

That's good enough.

BENNINGS

All right... Box of dynamite... box

of thermite... three shotguns... box

of flares... two flare guns... thirty

cans gasoline... and a case of

alcohol.

MACREADY

Let's load 'em.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHILDS

What is it?

MACREADY

Maybe dinner.

BENNINGS

Dogs don't eat each other.

MACREADY

(beat)

I know.

CHILDS

Where's the other half?

MACREADY

Probably the next meal.

MACREADY

Where these tracks headed?

BENNINGS

Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

MACREADY

Let's move.

CHILDS

They could be hours ahead of us,

Mac.

BENNINGS

Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed

to be fifty below tonight.

MACREADY

Turn back if you want.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHILDS

Where's the other one?

MACREADY

(to dog)

Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?

MACREADY

Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't

let up until he's ash.

MACREADY

Childs!!

MACREADY

(pulls him back)

Stay back!!

CHILDS

What we going to do?!

MACREADY

How the fuck do I know?!

MACREADY

Torch them!!

CHILDS

But...

MACREADY

He's gone already! Do it!

CUT TO:

CLARK

...I'm telling you I don't remember

leaving the kennel unlatched...

CHILDS

Bullshit! You left it open so they

could get out!

CLARK

...Would I even have told you they

were gone if I had anything to hide?

GARRY

But why didn't you kennel that dog

right away?

CLARK

I told you I couldn't find...

(pushes torch away)

...get that out of my face.

CHILDS

Don't you be telling me...

NAULS

(to Childs)

Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't

the judge and executioner around

here!

CHILDS

Who you trying to protect,

mutherfucker? I'm telling you this

S.O.B. could be one of them.

GARRY

Hold on, damn it. We're getting

nowhere... If this bit of Blair's

about absorbing and imitating is

true... then that dog could have

gotten to anybody.

DR. COPPER

And if it got to Clark... Clark could

have gotten to anybody.

DR. COPPER

Theoretically any of us could be

whatever the hell this thing is.

NORRIS

It's just too damn wild -- I can't

believe it.

MACREADY

Well, you can believe it now.

MACREADY

Nauls found this yesterday. It's

ripped just like the clothing on the

Norwegian we brought back. The same

thing was happening to Bennings'

clothes when it got to him. Seems

these Things don't imitate clothes.

Just flesh and bone.

MACREADY

Size large.

(grins)

What do you wear, Clark?

CLARK

So what?

NORRIS

I wear a size large, too.

MACREADY

So do I. So do most of us.

MACREADY

Doubt if it got to more than one or

two of us. But it got to someone.

(beat)

Somebody in this room ain't what he

appears to be.

SANCHEZ

(scared)

Well, what we going to do?

NORRIS

Can there be... some kind of test?

To find out who's what?

DR. COPPER

A serum test possibly.

FUCHS

Right. Why not?

GARRY

What's that?

DR. COPPER

It's a simple blood typing test.

This Thing's blood chemistry is

different than ours. Basically we

mix someone's blood with

uncontaminated human blood. If we

don't get the proper serum reaction --

then that person isn't human.

CHILDS

Whose uncontaminated blood we going

to use?

DR. COPPER

We've got blood plasma in storage.

GARRY

How long will it take you to prepare

this?

DR. COPPER

A couple of hours.

GARRY

Well, get to it.

PALMER

How's that Thing get to the dogs? I

though we stopped it in time.

MACREADY

Copper thinks they swallowed pieces

of it during the fight.

PALMER

And that was enough?

DR. COPPER (O.S.)

Garry. The rest of you! Come here!

DR. COPPER

Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged

it.

NAULS

Oh, my God.

MACREADY

Was it broken into?

FUCHS

No. Somebody opened it. Closed it.

And then locked it.

MACREADY

Well, who's got access to it?

DR. COPPER

I guess I'm the only one.

GARRY

And I've got the only key.

MACREADY

Would that test have worked?

DR. COPPER

I think so.

NORRIS

Somebody else sure as hell thought

so.

MACREADY

Who else could have used that key?

GARRY

Ah... no one... I give it to Copper

when he needs it...

MACREADY

Could anyone have gotten it from

you?

DR. COPPER

I don't see how... when I'm finished

I return it right away.

NORRIS

When was the last time you used it?

DR. COPPER

(uneasy)

A day or so ago... I guess.

GARRY

I suppose... well, it's possible

someone might have lifted it from

me. But...

CHILDS

That key ring of yours is always

hooked to your belt. Now how could

somebody get to it without you

knowing?

GARRY

(upset, flustered)

Look, I haven't been near that...

that refrigerator.

GARRY

Copper's the only one who has any

business with it.

DR. COPPER

Now... wait a second, Garry, you've

been in here on several occasions...

FUCHS

And the Doc thought of the test.

CHILDS

(anger)

So what?! Is that supposed to leave

him in the clear?! Bullshit!

GARRY

Hey, Sanchez!

CUT TO:

GARRY

Put that down!

SANCHEZ

(trembling)

No.

GARRY

I'll put this right through your

head.

SANCHEZ

You guys going to let him give orders?

I mean he could be one of those

Things.

MACREADY

(calm)

Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it

away.

GARRY

I don't know about Copper. But I

didn't go near that plasma...

(beat)

But I guess you'll all rest easier

if someone else is in charge.

GARRY

Can't see anyone objecting to you,

Norris.

NORRIS

Sorry, gentlemen...

(rubs chest)

...Don't think I'd be up to it.

Haven't been feeling well lately.

CHILDS

I'll take it...

MACREADY

Maybe it should be someone a bit

more even-tempered, Childs.

MACREADY

(to others)

...Any objections?

MACREADY

...From what we know this Thing likes

to go one on one. So we stick together

as much as possible. In two's and

three's.

CHILDS

What do we do about those three?

MACREADY

We got morphine, don't we.

MACREADY

Well, we keep them loaded. Stash

them here in the rec room and watch

'em twenty-four hours.

PALMER

(ears perk up)

Morphine? You know I was pretty close

to that dog, too.

NORRIS

We should sleep in shifts.

MACREADY

Right. Half of us awake at all times.

SANCHEZ

How we going to try and find out

who's... you know, who's who?

MACREADY

(to Fuchs)

Can you think of any other tests?

FUCHS

I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's

help though.

CHILDS

You can eighty-six that thought right

now, man.

MACREADY

Also... When this Thing turns... it

turns slowly at first. I think we

can handle it in that state. But if

it ever got to full power... from

what I saw of that Norwegian camp...

well, I just don't know... It would

probably take it an hour or more to

get like that. So no matter what

anybody's doing, we all return to

this room every twenty minutes.

Anybody gone longer than that...

anybody trying to leave... we kill

'em.

CUT TO:

PALMER

(mumbles)

Where's that magneto? Can't find a

darn thing around here any more.

DR. COPPER

I'll do it. You're going to break

the needle in my arm.

CHILDS

No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.

MACREADY

Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth.

NAULS

That thing's too smart to be hiding

any more of its clothes, MacReady.

MACREADY

Just keep looking.

MACREADY

How's it going?

FUCHS

Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've

been thinking... If our dogs changed

by swallowing parts of that other

one... We better see to it that

everyone prepares their own food and

we eat out of cans.

MACREADY

Gotchya.

PALMER

Childs, where's that magneto from

Chopper One?

CHILDS

Ain't it there?

PALMER

No it ain't there. Would I be asking

if it were there?

MACREADY

Move it, Palmer.

MACREADY

(to Palmer)

Start taking apart those snowmobiles

next, huh?

NAULS

I got your goodies, superdude.

NAULS

What you doin'?

BLAIR

Nobody's getting in here. You can

tell them all that!

NAULS

Well, who the hell you think wants

to get in there with you?

NAULS

Now why'd you go and...

BLAIR

And I don't want any more food with

sedatives in it. I know what you're

up to. Don't think I don't. And if

anyone tries to get in here -- I've

got rope. I'll hang myself before it

gets to me.

NAULS

You promise?

NAULS

Crazy white scientist motherfucker...

CLARK

Gotta go to the can, Childs.

CHILDS

Be quick.

CHILDS

Oh, no.

NAULS (O.S.)

Childs! That a fuse?

CHILDS

No. The generator. You got the

auxiliary box just off the kitchen.

Get to it.

(fumbling around)

Where's the damn flashlight?

(calling out)

You fellas okay over there?

CHILDS

Cut that out, Copper.

(beat)

Nauls? What's taking you?!

NAULS (O.S.)

I'm working it! Nothing's happening!

CHILDS

That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark,

out of the john where I can see you!

NAULS (O.S.)

It's shorted out or something!

CHILDS

(shouting)

Clark, you come on out here!!

CHILDS

Where's... Where's Garry?

CHILDS

Where are you, Garry? Don't you move

an inch, Copper.

(shouts)

Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!

NAULS

Somebody's taken it. I can't find

it!

CHILDS (O.S.)

Clark, you want me to come in after

you?!

MACREADY

(shouting)

What's happened?!

NORRIS (O.S.)

MacReady, that you?

MACREADY

Yeah!

NORRIS (O.S.)

It's the generator I think! No power.

MACREADY

(to Palmer)

Well, let's get down there.

CHILDS (O.S.)

MacReady!

MACREADY

What?

CHILDS (O.S.)

Garry's missing!

MACREADY

(to self)

Oh, shit!

(shouts)

Well, hang on!

CHILDS (O.S.)

Gee, thanks!

MACREADY

Where's Sanchez?

PALMER

The fuel pump... it's gone...

(frantic)

You've got to get up to supply, Mca.

If we don't get this thing started

soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll

never get it going.

MACREADY

Who... Who is that?

MACREADY

Sanchez...?  Hey, who...

PALMER (O.S.)

Mac, where the hell is that pump!!

CUT TO:

PALMER

Somebody definitely messed with it.

MACREADY

We going to make it?

PALMER

Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes.

What I don't get is...

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ

Where were the flashlights?

MACREADY

Screw the flashlights. Where the

hell were you?

PALMER

Tons of stuff's been missing around

here. Magnetos, cables, wire...

NAULS

Kitchen things, too...

MACREADY

Anybody see Fuchs... or hear him...?

Huh?

CHILDS

Where'd you go?

CHILDS

I said where? Where'd you go?!

GARRY

Was dark... find a light...

CHILDS

You lying bastard...

GARRY

(slurring)

I rather don't like your tone...

CHILDS

You sit back down...

NORRIS

Enough...

MACREADY

That storm's going to start ripping

any minute -- so we don't have much

time.

MACREADY

We've got to find Fuchs. When we

find him -- we kill him.

SANCHEZ

Why?

MACREADY

If he's one of those Things, we've

got to get to him before he changes...

Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check

the outside shacks...

MACREADY

Sanchez, you and Palmer search the

inside...

PALMER

I ain't going with Sanchez.

PALMER

I ain't going with him. I'll go with

Childs...

SANCHEZ

Well, screw you, man!

PALMER

I ain't going with you!

CHILDS

Well, who says I want you going with

me?!

MACREADY

Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez,

you come with us. Norris... you stay

here...

(refers to tied-up

men)

Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And

if you hear anything, anything at

all you let loose the siren. We all

meet back here in twenty minutes

regardless.

(a beat)

And everybody watch whoever you're

with. Real close.

MACREADY

Let's move.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PALMER

What'd we ever do to these Things

anyway...

PALMER

What?

CHILDS

Don't walk behind me.

PALMER

Right.

CUT TO:

MACREADY

Hey, Blair!!

MACREADY

Has Fuchs been out here?

BLAIR

I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd

like to come back inside... I don't

want to stay out here any more...

Funny things... I hear funny things

out here.

MACREADY

Have you come across Fuchs?

BLAIR

Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You

must let me back in... I won't harm

anyone... I promise...

MACREADY

We'll see...

BLAIR

I promise! I'm much better now! I'll

be good!! I'm all better!! Don't

leave me here!!

DR. COPPER

I'm getting worried about you. You

ought to have a checkup.

NORRIS

Let's just not get worried about

anything just now.

DR. COPPER

(yawning)

After all this mess then.

NORRIS

(nodding)

After all this mess.

PALMER

Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.

CHILDS

Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.

NAULS

(shouting to be heard)

Where's the roof?!

NAULS

This storm do that?

MACREADY

(shouting)

Couldn't be possible. Must have

weighted a ton and a half...

NAULS

Goddamn white women.

CHILDS

My babies.

PALMER

Somebody broke in.

CHILDS

Now who'd go and do...

PALMER

Childs!!

CHILDS

Let go of me...

PALMER

Don't get near 'em. The plants!

They're alive. Those things can

imitate anything...

CHILDS

What's it going to do, being a plant?

PALMER

We got to burn 'em.

CHILDS

Now hold on, you dumb...

CHILDS

You stupid, sonofa...

CUT TO:

SANCHEZ

Whoever put this through him...

SANCHEZ

...is one bad-ass and strong muther.

CHILDS

No one's that strong, boy!

PALMER

Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't

that its number -- to get more

recruits.

CHILDS

Wasn't enough time. Generator was

out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes

the bastards an hour, maybe two to

absorb somebody.

SANCHEZ

Why Fuchs?

CHILDS

He was working on a test. Fuchs must

have been onto something. These

bastards got scared and got rid of

him.

(suddenly realizing)

...Hey... Where's...

CUT TO:

PALMER

MacReady!!

CHILDS

Nauls!! MacReady!!

CHILDS

How long they been out now?

NORRIS

Forty... Forty-five minutes.

CHILDS

We better start closing off the

outside hatchways.

NORRIS (O.S.)

All of you! Come here!

CUT TO:

PALMER

Where's MacReady?

NAULS

Cut him loose of the line up by his

shack.

CHILDS

Cut him loose?

NAULS

When we were up poking around his

place... I found this...

NAULS

...It was stashed in his old coal

furnace... wind must have dislodged

it... I don't think he saw me find

it.

NAULS

...Made sure I got ahead of him on

the towline on the way back... cut

him loose.

SANCHEZ

(incredulous)

MacReady...?

NAULS

He's one of them.

SANCHEZ

(scared)

When do you think it got to him?

PALMER

Could have been anytime. Anywhere.

CHILDS

(to Nauls, suspicious)

If it did get to him.

NAULS

Look, man...

PALMER

When the lights went out...

NORRIS

Would have been a perfect time...

PALMER

Right. Garry was missing...

(pointedly)

...And Sanchez...

SANCHEZ

(goes for him)

Fuck you, Palmer.

NORRIS

This is just what it wants... to pit

us against each other.

MACREADY (O.S.)

Open up!

MACREADY (O.S.)

...Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me,

MacReady...

(still nothing)

...Come on, damn it... The towline

snapped. Been crawling around like a

seal out here...

NAULS

(harsh whisper)

Bullshit! He's got to know damn well

I cut it!

PALMER

Let's open it.

CHILDS

Hell no.

SANCHEZ

(shaking)

You think he's changed into one of

those Things?

NORRIS

He hasn't had enough time.

CHILDS

...Nothing human could have made it

back here in this weather without a

guideline...

MACREADY (O.S.)

...Where is everybody?! I'm half

frostbit!

PALMER

Let's open it. Now...

CHILDS

(edgy, hostile)

Why you so damn anxious to let him

in here...

PALMER

(slightly trembling)

He's so close. Maybe our best chance

to blow him away.

CHILDS

No. Just let him freeze out there.

SANCHEZ

(voice cracking)

What if we're wrong about him?

CHILDS

Then we're wrong.

PALMER

The supply window!

SANCHEZ

(terror)

What we going to...

NORRIS

All right... all right... we've got

no choice now...

MACREADY

What's going on out there?

CHILDS

Damn it, he's got the keys.

MACREADY

What are you doing?

CHILDS (O.S.)

You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a

dead whatever the hell you are!

CHILDS (O.S.)

We found your clothes -- the ones

you tried to burn.

MACREADY

What clothes?

CHILDS (O.S.)

You been made, MacReady.

MACREADY

Someone's trying to mark me, you

bastard... trying to frame me.

CHILDS

Move in slow now.

MACREADY

Anyone messes with me -- the whole

camp goes.

MACREADY

Put those torches on the floor and

back off.

MACREADY

...back way off.

MACREADY

...Where's the rest...

MACREADY

So help me I mean it!!

NAULS

It's cool, man. We ain't near you,

man... Stay cool...

PALMER

Yeah, man, really. Just relax.

MACREADY

Anybody touches me... we go.

NAULS

I don't think he's breathing.

MACREADY

Go untie the Doc. Get him in here.

Bring the others, too...

(grins menacingly)

From now on no one gets out of my

sight.

CUT TO:

MACREADY

So you sweethearts had yourselves a

little trial. I just may have to

kill you on general principle, Nauls.

MACREADY

...Ever occur to the jury that anybody

could have gotten to some of my

clothes and stuck them up...

CHILDS

We ain't buying that.

DR. COPPER

Damn it, quit the bickering and give

me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator

over here.

DR. COPPER

Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold

the mask over his face... Childs,

grab his shoulders.

CHILDS

(to MacReady,

threatening)

You're going to have to sleep

sometime.

DR. COPPER

Quiet down...

(to Sanchez)

...turn that thing on.

DR. COPPER

Now hold him.

MACREADY

I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...

DR. COPPER

Enough, MacReady!

DR. COPPER

Again... More current this time,

Sanchez...

MACREADY

And if anyone tries to wake me...

DR. COPPER

Damn you, MacReady!

SANCHEZ

God... what...?

MACREADY

Get out of the way!!

CLARK

What you got in mind, MacReady?

MACREADY

A little test.

PALMER

What kind of test?

MACREADY

I'm sure a lot of you already know.

MACREADY

Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone

down. Real tight.

CHILDS

What for?

MACREADY

For your health.

GARRY

(to others)

Let's rush him. He's not going to

blow us all up.

MACREADY

Damn if I won't.

CHILDS

(a beat)

You ain't tying me up.

MACREADY

Then I'll have to kill you.

CHILDS

Then kill me.

MACREADY

I mean it.

CHILDS

I guess you do.

CUT TO:

MACREADY

Tie up Clark, too.

PALMER

(bemused)

He's dead.

MACREADY

Norris looked pretty dead, himself.

Bullets don't kill these Things.

CHILDS

(muttering)

We should have jumped his ass.

MACREADY

Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

MACREADY

We're going to draw a little bit of

everybody's blood.

NAULS

What are you going to do? Drink it?

MACREADY

Watching Norris in there... gave me

the idea that maybe every part of

you bastards is a whole. Every piece

of you is self-sufficient, an animal

unto itself. When a man bleeds it's

just tissue. But blood from one of

you Things won't obey. It's a newly

formed individual with a built-in

desire to protect its own life. When

attacked, your blood will try and

survive -- and crawl away from a hot

needle say.

CUT TO:

MACREADY

Now you.

MACREADY

Slide it back here.

MACREADY

Now step way back.

MACREADY

I guess you're okay.

DR. COPPER

(shaken, facetious)

Thank you.

MACREADY

I didn't think you'd use that

fibrillator on Norris if you were

one of them.

MACREADY

Watch them.

MACREADY

Now I'll show you what I already

know.

CHILDS

Load of bullshit.

MACREADY

We'll see. Let's try Clark.

CHILDS

So Clark was human, huh?

CHILDS

So that make you a murderer.

MACREADY

Palmer now.

GARRY

Pure nonsense. This won't prove a

damn thing.

MACREADY

Thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

You were the only one who could have

gotten to that blood plasma...

(placing the wire in

Palmer's dish)

...we'll do you last...

MACREADY

Copper!!

CUT TO:

CHILDS

Let's do it, Bwana.

CHILDS

Muthafu...

CHILDS

Get me... get me the hell away from...

cut me loose, damn it!

GARRY

I know you gentlemen have been through

a lot. But when you find the time...

I'd rather not spend the rest of the

winter tied to this couch.

NAULS

Shut the damn hell up.

MACREADY

(almost a whisper)

Blair...

NAULS

What is it?

MACREADY

Everything that's been missing.

CHILDS

Spaceship of some kind.

MACREADY

Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece

by piece.

NAULS

Where was he trying to go?

MACREADY

Anyplace but here.

MACREADY

But he ain't going to make it.

CUT TO:

NAULS

What about Childs?

MACREADY

Forget about Childs. He's over.

GARRY

Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker

if we need to use them.

SANCHEZ

What if it doesn't come?

MACREADY

It'll come. It needs us. We're the

only thing left to imitate...

(to Sanchez)

Give me a hand.

MACREADY

(to Sanchez)

You and Nauls got to block off the

west side bunks, the mess hall and

the kitchen.

NAULS

(protest)

You crazy? He might be inside already?

MACREADY

Chance we got to take. We got to

force him to come down the east side

to the door we got rigged.

SANCHEZ

He might just wait us out.

MACREADY

I'm going to blow the generator when

you get back. He'll have to come for

us -- or freeze.

MACREADY

We've got portable heaters -- we'll

last longer.

MACREADY

...Hold it.

MACREADY

Sodium cyanide. We place them between

our cheeks and gums... This Thing

can't imitate anything that's dead.

MACREADY

If it gets a hold of you -- bite

down... They're supposed to be fast

and painless... Now move.

CUT TO:

MACREADY

Looks good.

GARRY

One thousand volts. Should be enough.

SANCHEZ

You hear that?

NAULS

Hear what?

NAULS

It's got into the pub! It's turned

on the stereo!

SANCHEZ

What?!

NAULS

It's in between us and them!! How we

going to get back?!

SANCHEZ

I can't hear you.

MACREADY

What are they doing out there?!

GARRY

What's he saying?

NAULS

MacReady! We been cut off!!

MACREADY

Got to get to the generator.

NAULS

Get back!!

MACREADY

The generator!

NAULS

Screw the generator!!

NAULS

Got Sanchez... World War Three

wouldn't mess with this fucker...

Can go through walls... And it's

like all over the place...

MACREADY

Calm down and get in your position.

NAULS

Position, my ass...

GARRY

I'm going to bump this up, much as I

can.

NAULS

Boulder Dam might do it.

CUT TO:

GARRY

How long's it been?

MACREADY

Little over two hours.

NAULS

Maybe it ain't coming.

MACREADY

Then we go after him.

NAULS

Bet the last place you ever go.

MACREADY

Wait...

CUT TO:

MACREADY

Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be

on your toes! We're going to do a

little remodeling!

MACREADY (O.S.)

Chime in if you know that words, old

boy.

MACREADY

You like whiskey? Come on, join me

for a drink. Be good for you. Grow

fangs on your chest.

MACREADY

Damn it, ran out of gas.

MACREADY

Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty

cold in here soon... You better make

your move... I mean, hell, I'm only

one person...

MACREADY

I know you're bugged because we ruined

your trip, right? Spiffy little toy

you had there.

MACREADY

But your real hang up is your looks...

MACREADY

(wants him bad)

Atta boy. I know you're around.

MACREADY

Come on, sucker.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHILDS

Did you kill it?

MACREADY

I think so.

CHILDS

What do you mean "you think so?"

MACREADY

Yeah. I got it.

(refers to Childs'

condition)

Pretty mean frostbite.

CHILDS

It'll turn black again soon enough.

Then I guess I'll be losing the whole

thing...

(refers to feet)

...Think my toes are already gone.

CHILDS

So you're the only one who made it.

MACREADY

Not the only one.

CHILDS

The fire's got the temperature way

up all over camp... won't last long

though.

MACREADY

Neither will we.

CHILDS

Maybe we should try and fix the

radio... try and get some help.

MACREADY

Maybe we shouldn't.

CHILDS

Then we'll never make it.

MACREADY

Maybe we shouldn't make it.

CHILDS

(beat)

If you're worried about anything,

let's take that blood test of yours.

MACREADY

If we've got any surprises for each

other -- we shouldn't be in any

condition to do anything about it.

(beat)

You play chess?

CHILDS

I guess I'll be learning.

FADE OUT:

THE END
