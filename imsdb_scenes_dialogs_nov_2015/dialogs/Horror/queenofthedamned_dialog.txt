QUEEN OF THE DAMNED

FADE IN:

1   EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1

An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We

hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-

century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past

the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and

CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.

VOICE (V.O.)

There comes a time for every vampire

when the idea of eternity becomes

momentarily unbearable...

As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT

OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:

A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,

silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.

VOICE (V.O.)

The wounds suffered from love and

failed friendships don't heal like

a human's, but seem to only gape

larger. The longing to be mortal

returns, a longing for finiteness.

A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

4   EXT. TOMB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               4

The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.

VOICE (V.O.)

In 1883 I suffered such a spell

and decided to cease feeding on

blood. Just lie in the earth and

let time return to its natural

state...

As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine

growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER

and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.

Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the

sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months

fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns

all around the tomb.

VOICE (V.O.)

I had hoped the sounds of the

passing eras would fade out, and a

kind of death might happen. A

kind of forgetting where I would

be healed from my wounds.

The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS

DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.

VOICE (V.O.)

But as I lay there, the sounds

didn't fade but grew with the

world.

The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET

STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS

MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK

BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.

VOICE (V.O.)

And gradually the world didn't

sound like the place I had left,

but something different...

better...

As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of

the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...

VOICE (V.O.)

A new fearless attitude had

possessed the world, brave and

Godless. I began to wonder if it

was not time to resurrect. But

the thing that eventually brought

me back -- the decisive thing

really -- came like a bolt out of

the blue.

GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw

and dark.

5   SERIES OF GLIMPSES                                            5

Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and

a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.

Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored

nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the

confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or

girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in

on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and

LOUDER than the rest.

A music so sublime, so deeply

vampiric, I had no doubt it could

be heard in Hades. I had no

LESTAT (V.O.)

Whether it was that first meal,

the music, or the 100 years of

rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I

was feeling better than ever. My

appetite for living was voracious.

My hearing so exact I could locate

precisely the source of the

music...

irresistible urge...

LESTAT

You may call me the vampire Lestat.

LESTAT (V.O.)

It just rolled out of my mouth.

With one simple sentence I had

betrayed everything about my kind.

Betrayed our code of secrecy.

LESTAT

Your struggles are over.

LESTAT

All that you've ever dreamed of

will be yours.

ALEX

It was a bold move, I admit. But

So, Lestat. You say you're a

real vampire. Correct me if I'm

wrong, but what I remember about

vampires is you guys usually keep

your identity secret.

LESTAT

Yes. But why hide it in this day

shadows for centuries. It's time

to share myself with the world.

us a demonstration of your powers?

LESTAT

If you like, I'll give you a

private demonstration in your

Why not a demo at your own house?

I mean, what's with all the

secrecy about where you stay? Is

it true you move residences every

LESTAT

nothing)

After calling one stone tomb home

sweet home for so long, I like to

experience as much diversity as I

can. Wouldn't you?

MUSIC JOURNALIST

There are a lot of rumors flying

around the internet about the

hidden meaning in your lyrics,

that you're giving away 'vampire

secrets.' Something in all that?

A melancholy look comes over Lestat.

Come out, come out, whoever you

I have reason to believe Lestat's

an ancient one.

TALAMASCAN #1

I don't know, Jesse. It looks to

me like the guy's got a good P.R.

JESSE

Well,i have. In one of his songs

he refers to a pub called the

Sailor's Arms. I think it's a

clue...

JESSE

(reading screen)

'Where are you now? Back in the

sailor's arms, somewhere in the

back streets of Soho?' I tracked

down the old leases in London. It

turns out, in the late 1700's,

there was a pub right in the

backstreets of Soho called the

Sailor's Arms.

JESSE

And it had a reputation for

dealing with black magic.

Witches' covens, seances, that

sort of thing.

JESSE

And most importantly, reports of

people being lured there and

subsequently attacked by

bloodsucking fiends.

JESSE

Here's where you could find the

Sailor's Arms in old London.

today. Of course the Sailor's

Arms is not there anymore. That

part of London is mostly old

warehouses, meat-packing plants.

TALAMASCAN #2

In a few years it will be artists'

lofts and pretentious French

cafes...

JESSE

Yes, but right now there's only

one place to get a drink -- of

sorts. A private club -- in

exactly the same place. The

Waverly Arms.

JESSE

Well, what happens at the Waverly

Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms

look like a Happy Meal at

McDonald's.

JESSE

It's a vampire coven. And

Lestat's leading us to it.

us to them and --

Interesting. Perhaps we should

assign someone to observe --

TALAMASCAN #1

Oh please, based on this so-called

'data'? That's a waste of time.

But... uh...

TALAMASCAN #2

Look, I know it was breaking

protocol and I'm really sorry,

it's just I think --

TALAMASCAN #1

Jesse! You're just an apprentice

here! You must follow our

rules... Or perhaps we need to

reconsider your position.

TALAMASCAN #3

For 12 centuries our mission as

Talamascans has been to observe

and record paranormal behavior.

But never get involved. You're

getting far too close.

JESSE

(gesturing to photo,

defending herself)

Hey, does it look like I got

involved? That is not called

involvement. That is called

running.

TALAMASCAN #2

(leaning forward,

trying to help)

But, Jesse, tell us, what did you

see?

JESSE

Vampires.   Gathering.   I'm sure of

it.

JESSE (CONT'D)

Many of the references could only

be derived from years of research

in the Bibliotech de Paris, which

seems unlikely for a young rock

star in his early twenties. Plus

there are historical details

dating back hundreds of years

Lestat describes that don't exist

anywhere... except in our library.

He refers to Marius, the great

white lord, who ruled over a group

of islands off the Bay of Naples

in the late 18th Century. What

I'm trying to say here, and maybe

I'm not doing the best job of it,

is that Lestat may be the oldest

and most powerful vampire ever

documented!

TALAMASCAN #1

It doesn't make any sense. Why

would he be forecasting this to

the world? He's all but drawn a

map and marked an X. What

vampires hold sacred is keeping

their kind a secret. You never

name other immortals, tell where

their lairs are. They'd be hunted

down.

JESSE

Right. That's the best part.

Lestat's not afraid to piss them

off. He wants mortals and

immortals to know he's there, to

know he exists. I don't know

why...

(glancing at skeptical

Talamascan #1)

But this has never happened

before. Don't you see? He's a

one man revolution.

And this photo is your evidence?

It's hardly conclusive.

(snorts)

C'mon. It looks like the Blair

witch!

JESSE

Fine. Well then, I guess I'll

just have to go back and get

better, more conclusive evidence!

Maybe you just can't unravel all

the mysteries of the world out

there, by sitting around all day

in a dusty old library in here!

You in...

(to UNATTRACTIVE GUY)

You, no.

UNATTRACTIVE GUY

C'mon, man, she's waiting for me

in there. She said she was

putting me on the list. My name's

Norman --

BOUNCER #1

Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a

life, alright?

(to another sexy

You.   No.

Lestat lunges like a phantom -- a flash of teeth -- as

they FALL FROM FRAME, the distinct sound of BONE

CRUSHING. Over this scene the BAND'S SONG rushes in.

CUT TO:

Lestat enters. Dabs his mouth politely with a white

handkerchief, the sound of the BAND practicing from

below.

43    INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LONDON) - SOUND STUDIO - JUST AFTER         43

Lestat and his band rehearse one of their numbers, music

and voice melding into a grand, almost operatic harmony.

44    INT. CONTROL BOOTH                                               44

Two SOUND ENGINEERS work the board.

SOUND ENGINEER #1

When's the concert?

SOUND ENGINEER #2

Four days.

SOUND ENGINEER #1

These guys are gonna kill.

Behind them, Roger sits pensively watching.

Surreptitiously, he glances down at a book on his lap --

its title Vampires -- The Occult Truth. He talks on a

phone.

ROGER

Yeah, Phil. We'll need a limo

from the airport. I don't know

which airfield yet... I don't know

the arrival time either.

Yeah... I'll call you from the

driver where he's taking us... Hey

I don't even know myself... pick

up address in London?... Forget

it... you'd never find this place.

Christ we'll probably have changed

houses again by then... What can I

say, the guy's just...

ROGER

How's everything? You alright?

You sleeping okay?

JESSE

Yeah, I'm great. I just found a

vampire.

TALBOT

(considers her)

Jesse... you're taking this Lestat

stuff pretty seriously... why?

JESSE

Cause I think I'm on to something

pretty big. The most important

sighting Talamasca's had in

years...

(beat, sighs)

Jesus, I don't know, David... I

thought I was onto something...

Maybe I didn't see anything...

TALBOT

You know we work in a really

strange field? The supernatural

is beguiling at times. It doesn't

like to just be observed, it is

only satisfied when it has drawn

us in completely. I know cause

I've felt these things myself.

TALBOT (CONT'D)

That's what we have to resist, as

Talamascans...

(as a shadow crosses

his face)

It's not always easy.

JESSE

(leaning forward)

Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm

not freaking out on you. I'm just

onto what looks -- alright looked

-- like a good lead. You're the

one who taught me how to do all

this. You're the one who taught

me to keep pushing and pushing...

JESSE

David. There's nothing else.

Nothing is 'beguiling' me,

alright? Nothing. C'mon.

TALBOT

Alright.   Just checking...

TALBOT

Well, all I can say is you're

really lucky you're not lying

dead in a gutter with two holes

on your neck.

JESSE

I'd be even luckier if that damn

picture came out...

(stops in her tracks,

turns back, gazes at

him, amazed)

Wait a second. So you do believe

me? You do think it's a vampire

coven.

sparkling)

Yes. But not exactly for the

reasons you think. Though your

research is top-notch of course...

(smiles)

Come back here. I'm gonna show

you something.

TALBOT

What do you see?

JESSE

They're all nightscapes. The

detail is amazing. Mid-1500s.

Florence.

TALBOT

Right. And what do you see in

this one?

TALBOT

And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.

JESSE

This man is in both.

TALBOT

Right.   He's in all of them.

JESSE

Have you --

TALBOT

Carbon tested? Yes. The

different paint samples are all

authentic. All painted at the

time of that particular style.

TALBOT

It's Marius, Jesse.

JESSE

(whirling around)

Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics.

I knew I was right.

TALBOT

Yes, you were. Good work.

TALBOT

I've been personally tracing

him for decades. My little

obsession. The oldest vampire

ever documented. The closest

we've come to the original

vampire.

JESSE

What do you mean the original

vampire?

TALBOT

There's a Mesopotamian legend that

there once was a queen of Egypt,

Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or

Nefertiti. She was believed to be

the original vampire... Marius

himself dates back to 400 B.C...

JESSE

David, you've been tracking Marius

your whole life. Maybe he's out

there waiting for you right now.

(without looking

at him)

Don't you ever want to just go and

find him and --

TALBOT

No. Jesus, we are not talking

about having a drink at the

Dorchester, Jesse. You know that.

Especially with the ancient

vampires -- the older they are,

the more powerful, the more

dangerous...

TALBOT

Anyway, you don't need to go and

stake out some club. Your time is

too valuable. I have something

far better for you...

JESSE

(surprised)

You do?

TALBOT

Yes. And I'll tell you something.

I've never shown this to anyone.

No one else has proved themself

in the way you have.

JESSE

(touched)

Thanks. What is it?

TALBOT

Oh you're gonna love this.

(glancing at her)

Although I'm sure it will keep you

up nights to come with nightmares...

Lestat's diary. I found it some

years ago. This is where you'll

find the answers you need.

TALBOT

They don't need to know

everything, right?

JESSE

Thank you for this.

TALBOT

My pleasure. When I took you on

as an apprentice, I knew it was

the smartest thing I'd ever done.

Now you and I'll meet when you're

done... This will be our project...

MARIUS

I'm unknowable by nature.

But you may call me Marius.

LESTAT

I'm the lord of a great manor.

They'll send an army of men to

look for me.

MARIUS

I doubt they'll find you,

Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long

way from home...

MARIUS

You're weak... near passing. I

can barely hear your heartbeat.

LESTAT

I'll kill you!

MARIUS

You really do fear nothing. It is

why I chose you. Because you

think things are possible which

aren't possible...

LESTAT

Chose me? For what?

MARIUS

My companion. Someone to share my

burden.

MARIUS

You've lost a great deal of blood.

That's enough, my son... When you

feed, you must hold back from the

moment of death. You must never

take the last drop, or it will

draw you in and you will die...

MARIUS

Remember, there is wisdom in the

flesh, Lestat. A man wears his

history on his skin...

MARIUS

I'm talking about humanity.

LESTAT

Humanity?

(snort)

We're murderers.

MARIUS

We're more than that. Their blood

that we take into us carries with

it life... their life, their

knowledge, their complexity.

Appreciate your prey, Lestat.

LESTAT (V.O.)

My senses run amok, like a newborn

child. And as for my new powers,

I was beside myself with the

pleasure of it all...

MARIUS

The trick is to find the way to

face eternity head on. The

spirit can be annihilated by

boredom just as the body can be

destroyed by sun or fire. My

solace, my delight, is witnessing

the unfolding of human destiny...

MARIUS

... From Christ to the Dark Ages

to the enlightenment, I've never

been able to divine what was coming.

That's what keeps me going -- I

can't wait to see what human

beings are going to do next...

MARIUS

Who could've predicted the

Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his

elephants?

MARIUS

Careful.

LESTAT

But why must we hide, Marius? We

are the powerful, we are the

immortal. We should walk fearless

in the open!

MARIUS

Shhh. The life of a vampire is a

life of discretion. We must sleep

during the day, when we are

vulnerable to the sun. Mortals

must never know about us. It is

forbidden, for the sake of all our

kind.

LESTAT

(gazing at violin

player as it sinks in)

So I could never know her?

MARIUS

Not unless you wanted to kill her.

LESTAT

(beat, quietly,

intensely)

So I can never be known?

MARIUS

You're known by me. I granted you

that. There are others of our

kind... though most are solitary

creatures.

LESTAT

My God...

MARIUS

Forget God. You're no longer in

his realm. Now we must leave.

Because... because... he's wise, a

philosopher... he asks the big

questions. Like how are you going

to get through eternity? It's

easier for us mortals. Life is

brief, but for you...

JESSE

I mean... what can you really do

with immortality besides just slip

from one day to the next, trapped

in a void of meaninglessness,

relieved only by your next victim?

How do you not give in to despair

hopelessness?

still want to walk with the

living, don't you, Lestat?

LESTAT

Well, I'm not hiding now, am I?

JESSE

No, but the only time you're not

really alone is when you kill...

But, Lestat, you can't help it...

it's not your fault... He made

you this way...

LESTAT

(with her blood on

his lips, shakes

his head)

Ah.    Poor, poor me...

LESTAT

Well, Talamascan, you're certainly

a very clever librarian, aren't

you?

LESTAT

(shaking his head)

How sad, you people always trying

to know the unknowable... So, was

it a good read? My diary.

LESTAT

Talamasca's been following me for

years. I've never known one to be

so brave. Or is it just foolish?

JESSE

I... I'm only an apprentice.

LESTAT

Go. I'm through with you. Your

kind never satisfies my thirst.

JESSE

Does anything, Lestat?

JESSE

I mean, what's the point of coming

into the light if not to have

someone really know you?

JESSE

You want the world to see you're

real, don't you, Lestat? Don't

you? Well, here I am!

LESTAT

You better just stick to your

books, Talamascan. 'Cause you

have it all wrong. I love all

this. I delight in it. The

dark, dreary world I went to

sleep in has burnt itself out and

been replaced by the 20th Century

-- can you imagine my joy at

waking up to discover such a

world? It has outdistanced my

wildest dreams of it. I scream of

good and evil, and mortals stand

and cheer. I adore being back in

action... every moment, every

single drop of it! Now consider

yourself exceedingly lucky and go!

JESSE

Lestat!

JESSE

There's something you left out of

your diary.

LESTAT

(amazed)

What?

JESSE

(stares right into

his eyes)

You kept her violin, didn't you?

JESSE

Hey, it's okay. I understand...

(softly)

After all, it's only human.

I'm going to Los Angeles for the

JESSE

LESTAT

More!

MARIUS

I don't think so, my little lord.

LESTAT

Let me go!

MARIUS

No. You've drunk the purest

blood. Seen the oldest of things

-- far too much for one as young

as you. You've been unconscious

for days.

God, her blood is like liquid

fire.

She... she is your mother, my

mother... Akasha, the Queen of all

who are damned. And he is her

King.

LESTAT

Release me!

She made you quite powerful.

(withdrawing a saber

from its sheath)

Don't make me use this!

LESTAT

Marius, please, just one more

time. I felt the sun. The light,

Marius, the light!

MARIUS

Lestat, listen to me! I have

watched over Akasha and her King

for 2000 years! They must never

awaken!

MARIUS

Akasha and her King nearly drank

this earth dry when they ruled

over Egypt. They drank until

they lost their will to drink.

They became living statues. And

yet Akasha still sustains the

life force of all vampires. It

is believed what happens to her,

happens to all of us.

You'll not stop me...

I hear her blood in your voice...

In all the years I've cared for

them, not once have they moved...

LESTAT

Until tonight. And she chose me!

Me! Never you! You'll not stop

me!

MARIUS

You are part of a great coven!

You take responsibility for your

kind!

LESTAT

I chose you for your bravery, but

selfishness. I can no longer trust

LESTAT (V.O.)

But there was no answer -- just

the endless procession of days,

months, years... My teacher left

96    INT. PLANE - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                   96

Jesse closes the journal, her eyes wide with the new

knowledge of Lestat's past. She sits there a moment,

speechless, then stares out at the vast, black night.

TILT DOWN TO:

97    EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                      97

SUPERIMPOSE:    LOS ANGELES

PAN DOWN to Lestat standing on the edge of a very high

fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown,

gazing into the dark night. The fence encircles his

Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a

medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in

the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes.

Lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As

we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT

SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC

and with a visual splash we are... MOVING SWIFTLY ACROSS

the globe with the MUSIC -- as we CUT ACROSS the world

INTO the west and INTO... The night fallen over Asia

where we soon find ourselves in...

98    ASIAN FACTORY                                                  98

sweatshop BOOM BOX.

99    INDIAN MARKETPLACE                                             99

where LESTAT'S MUSIC plays from SPEAKERS in a shop

window. We TRAVEL WESTWARD TO...

100   ANCIENT GRAVEYARD                                              100

where the... Ground splits open before our very eyes.

From out of the dirt, a beautiful teenage boy stands

naked...

101   VAMPIRE ARMAND                                                 101

He pulls the pieces of a worm-eaten coffin from his

person, as the MUSIC travels further to...

102   MASSIVE ANCIENT STONES                                         102

parting as another resurrected figure rises from the

darkness and reveals itself to be...

103   VAMPIRE PANDORA                                              103

With one self-assured twist of her head, she shakes the

red dust from her hair to reveal long curling black

tresses falling down over her dark-skinned shoulders.

The MUSIC travels further to...

104   PORTABLE RADIO                                               104

held by a camel driver camping out in the Sahara Desert.

His CAMEL BRAYS fearfully... The camel driver stares

before him, drop-jawed and terrified, and we now see what

he sees...

105   CAMEL DRIVER'S POV                                           105

A corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begins to move, as

a figure in tattered rags emerges from the sarcophagus and

unbandages his face and neck, shakes the sand from his

hair and eyes to reveal a skeletal form with white

leathery skin bulging with strange blue veins...

106   BACK TO SCENE                                                106

The VAMPIRE KHAYMAN offers the driver a polite smile.

The driver faints back into the sand as the camels bolt

off. And still LESTAT'S MUSIC plays as we finally END UP

AT...

107   SANCTUARY OF AKASHA AND ENKIL                                107

An OVER the SHOULDER SHOT of Enkil sitting motionless in

his throne, not resurrecting at all. Akasha and her

throne remain O.S. We MOVE CLOSER to reveal... Enkil's

throat gapes, torn open, and whereas before his skin

was pale, it's now a chalkish powder. And next to him...

Akasha's throne sits empty. A god again walks the earth.

A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into

white dust.

108   INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                        108

A tall, shapely female flight attendant sways down the

first-class aisle of an airplane, her back TO us. She

stops by a seat where Jesse sleeps uncomfortably. Pulling

out a blanket, the attendant drapes it over Jesse, tucking

it closely around her neck, then, curiously, the stewardess

leans down.

68.

109   CLOSE ON LIPS                                                109

begins to sensually kiss Jesse's neck. We begin to hear

the BEATING of a HEART, getting LOUDER...

The lips part to expose fangs slowly sinking themselves

into Jesse's skin. She murmurs in her sleep...

JESSE

Lestat.

110   WIDER                                                        110

She stirs awake to see -- the face of Akasha, her green

eyes flashing bright.

wakes with a start.

JESSE

Akasha!

Jesse looks up to see the real ATTENDANT is standing next

to her.

ATTENDANT

We've started our approach into

L.A. You should fasten your seat

belt.

Jesse nods and quickly fastens her belt, pulls it tight.

112   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                    112

Lestat suddenly glides through an open door and calmly

touches ground. He empties his pockets out on a coffee

table. We see a --

113   CLOSEUP - BOX OF MATCHES                                     113

"Sky Bar."

114   BACK TO SCENE                                                114

Dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief, Lestat tosses it on

top of the matches to reveal fresh bloodstains on the

cloth... a look of loneliness clouds his face.

I hate bedtime.

He turns, enters his bedroom, closing the door behind him.

115   INT. LESTAT'S MANSION - STRANGE POV - EVENING                 115

We find ourselves in the strange blue-grey world of a

VAMPIRE'S POV, walking THROUGH Lestat's mansion. PAST

his band, James, Alex and Maudy, laying in the studio in

a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery.

We MOVE menacingly INTO... Lestat's expensive living

quarters, PAST the huge glassed-in space and into

Lestat's private hall, leading to his bedroom door. We

ENTER easily, PASSING the enormous bed, and CONTINUE

THROUGH INTO a smaller, darker chamber... OVER TO

Lestat's coffin, stealthily APPROACHING his "sleeping"

figure laying closed-eyed and almost peaceful-looking,

when...

116   LESTAT                                                        116

bolts up   and looks around the room to see... nobody.

Lestat's   instincts are as alive as they could ever be as

he scans   the room with all his powers, and to his utter

surprise   finally sees...

117   WIDER                                                         117

A painting leans against a wall, turned front-side-over.

Lestat gets out of his coffin and goes over to the

painting with trepidation. He turns it over and then

smiles to himself. It is a portrait of Lestat as a

rocker. The hand and style are unmistakable.

LESTAT

(whisper)

Marius...!

118   INT. LESTAT'S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION       118

Lestat bursts out the doors of his bedroom and looks down

into the living room. Marius sits on a couch, still

dressed in red velvet, studying the Rolling Stone with

Lestat on the cover.

MARIUS

Marius looks up. The two vampires regard each other for

a long moment. Lestat is overcome with conflicting

emotions. Guarded smiles rise to their faces.

MARIUS

It is good to see you, Lestat.

LESTAT

And you. Still wearing the old

fashions, I see.

MARIUS

Old habits die hard.

LESTAT

How did you manage to slip through

the 1950s in red velvet?

MARIUS

I slept.

LESTAT

Don't think you missed much.

MARIUS

Elvis.

LESTAT

Elvis, yes.

MARIUS

(holding up the

Rolling Stone)

You're bigger than he is now.

LESTAT

I'd say a few pounds lighter.

Though, if you ever catch me

wearing a white jumpsuit, you have

my permission to slice off my

head.

MARIUS

If someone doesn't get to you

first.

Lestat grins, feeling Marius's disapproval.

LESTAT

Live and let live.

MARIUS

If it were only so simple, my son.

LESTAT

(a beat)

How did you find me?

MARIUS

You forget. We ancients have

powers no ordinary vampires

possess... And I know you. I

remembered how you admired the

medieval fortresses in the

hilltowns of Lyon.

(gestures to house)

All you're missing is the moat

and the cannons... which you

may need.

Lestat doesn't want to hear it.

LESTAT

Come, let me show you what it

means to live in the light.

119   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - CONTINUOUS ACTION                         119

Lestat and Marius sit perched on a giant billboard

advertising Lestat's concert. Down below, Sunset Strip

is filled with Goths, club hoppers, HONKING CARS, a

traffic jam.

MARIUS

(sarcastic)

Impressive. Reminds me of mad old

Druids running around chanting in

the forest. Very primitive stuff.

LESTAT

Out there. My fans. Thousands and

thousands. They worship me.

Millions of arms reach out to

embrace, beg me to come into their

lives.

MARIUS

It's what you've always wanted.

LESTAT

With all my black little heart.

MARIUS

Do you think of anyone but

yourself?

LESTAT

I only have myself.

MARIUS

It may be time to get ready for

some company.

LESTAT

What's that supposed to mean?

MARIUS

Your music's woken a very old

friend...

Lestat looks at Marius, trying to understand.

MARIUS

Can't you hear it? Or is the

applause all you can hear now?

Marius becomes eerily still. A deep, somber TONE starts

to VIBRATE. The GROUND RUMBLES. Lestat taken aback,

remembers the scope of Marius's power. Lestat stares at

Marius, then closes his eyes...

120   CLOSE ON LESTAT'S EYES                                      120

As the sounds of the WORLD seem to FADE AWAY, revealing

beneath the cacophony of mortals a DEEP PULSE like the

beating of a heart the size of a planet.

121   BACK TO SCENE                                               121

Lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the WORLD

rush BACK IN. Marius stares for a beat, then --

MARIUS

Akasha has risen. She has taken

her King's blood. Absorbed his

power. You've done it this time.

Lestat stares at Marius, letting the knowledge sink in.

Then he grins.

LESTAT

Good! I'm glad she's risen!     Let

her come.

MARIUS

Don't you understand?   You must

stop this concert!

(CONTINUED)

73.

121   CONTINUED:                                                       121

LESTAT

(shakes his head at

Marius)

200 years and the same broken

record.

MARIUS

No. Not the same! You've only

known Akasha dormant. She too

will find you. She is choosing

her moment. She has come to

destroy you, Lestat. And in her

wrath, she will devour everything

that moves. Mortal and vampire

alike.

LESTAT

(smiles at Marius,

softly)

Well then, it's every vampire for

himself. Just the kind of rules I

like. The rules you taught me.

Marius is enraged, tries to control himself.      Lestat

gazes at him, speaks steadily.

LESTAT

Do you remember your first words

to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.'

(shakes his head)

I'd rather not exist at all than

have to live eternally as a ghost.

MARIUS

And you're taking everyone with

you, you fool! We were once

mortals, too. It is our heritage

we protect!

LESTAT

(moving away)

Such reverence for mortals! Then

you should have left me as one!

MARIUS

You're a monster.

LESTAT

(shakes his head with a

dark laugh)

Said the vampire to his son.

Lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into

the black night. Marius stands alone.

CUT TO:

74.

122   INT. VAMPIRE COVEN BAR (LONDON/SOHO) - NIGHT                   122

No mortals in sight. Amongst various vampires, we spy

the Vampire Lover talking to the Punk Vampire who tried

to attack Jesse.

123   EXT. VAMPIRE BAR - FRONT DOOR                                  123

The vampire doorman opens the door and peers out.   A

figure moves towards him...

124   AKASHA                                                         124

glowing, beautiful, majestic. The vampire doorman is

frightened, but mesmerized as she moves in...

125   INT. VAMPIRE BAR                                               125

The barman looks up at the sound of the DOOR SLAMMING.

He does a double-take and watches in awe as... Akasha

steps in. Everyone in the bar turns. She smiles at

all the undead staring at her.

AKASHA

Hello...

Her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching,

then she hears a Vampire Lestat VIDEO PLAYING. She

whirls around quickly to the TV -- gazes at the video

intensely. Her eyes narrow, focus on Lestat, speaks as

if to herself.

AKASHA

Hmmm... his scent is fading.     He

was here too long ago...

The Vampire Lover slides up next to her.

VAMPIRE LOVER

You like him, love?

AKASHA

(still staring at TV)

He reminds me of someone I know.

VAMPIRE LOVER

All he's gonna remind you of soon

is a pile of bones. We're gonna

dismember him. Bleed him dry.

AKASHA

Really? Is that what you're

going to do?

(CONTINUED)

75.

125   CONTINUED:                                                   125

She turns to Vampire Lover, takes him in.

As if with a new idea, smiles at him, moves to the

dance floor, moving to LESTAT'S MUSIC, her eyes closed,

swaying sensually, her hips gyrating. The dance is

seductive, slow, her head thrown back. The vampires

turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her

movements. They move to the dance floor, watching.

Akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to

Vampire Lover, points to him, beckons. He smiles back,

happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. She

dances a little farther away. A game. He laughs.

Moves closer.

CLOSE ON VAMPIRE LOVER

He hears a LAUGH.

BACK TO AKASHA

But she's disappeared. He turns. Akasha's behind him

now. He stares at her. Her hips are gyrating, her

body slithering. A moan escapes from him. Again, he

moves to her, reaches for her. She laughs.

CLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE

He turns...

She's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's

smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her,

determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up

tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of

desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her

lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his

body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She

kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. On Vampire

Lover's face, pure pleasure...

AKASHA

Then again, you could always do

this...

Akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same

time, plunges her hand down. We can't see where... We

STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM

FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH.

LOUD SUCKING. A look of horror appears on

Vampire Lover's face. Akasha REAPPEARS. In her hand,

she now holds...

(CONTINUED)

76.

125   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             125

... his dripping heart.    She brings it to her lips, sucks

again thirstily...

Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry

husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover,

his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops

him unceremoniously to the floor...

Akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires.

They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself

LOUDLY.

Akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if

refreshed.

AKASHA

Turn up the music!

The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES.

AKASHA

(smiles, to herself)

Oh, I do love the 21st Century.

Akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him

over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching

for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her

strength...

The Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie,

flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just

turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The

Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano

player and guitar player go up in flames...

All hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the

door. The lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as

the flames overwhelm them...

And THROUGH the flames, we see Akasha smiling, now

sucking on the Punk Vampire's aorta like it's a straw.

She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her

bloody, thirsty lips. She strides out through the flames.

In a whispery, sing-song voice.

AKASHA

Lesta-at... come out, come out

wherever you are.

77.

126   EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT                                    126

Marius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing

down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like

mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the

trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,

peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.

Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.

It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.

MAEL

Marius, you've broken your oath.

You were to watch over Akasha

and Khayman. You are a great

disappointment to me.

Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping

from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in

Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired

beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his

Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her

grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair,

alabaster skin.

MARIUS

Pandora, Armand, it's been a long

time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do

I owe this honor?

KHAYMAN

You have been summoned because of

your errant child...

Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the

distance at Lestat's house.

PANDORA

(giving deep,

sexy laugh)

He's quite the devil, isn't he?

ARMAND

His music mocks us, Pandora!

PANDORA

His music moves my blood.

ARMAND

Keep your amorous thoughts to

yourself. His music is a threat

to all vampires. We will let the

covens dismember him at his

concert.

(CONTINUED)

78.

126   CONTINUED:                                                  126

MAEL

Yes.   It will set an example.

MARIUS

I don't see how this solves

things. This isn't thought

through.

KHAYMAN

Marius, we understand your

affection for Lestat, but your

duty is to us!

He gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening

glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.

KHAYMAN

We could always get rid of him

right now.

MAEL

No. We will contact the covens.

Let them know we condone the

slaying. It will be better for

all to see.

Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael.

Maharet steps up.

MAHARET

Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We

have greater problems...

MARIUS

(stepping up)

Maharet is right. It is Akasha

we face now.

PANDORA

(joyous)

Is it true, Maharet?   Has our

Queen really risen!

MAHARET

Don't be so happy, Pandora. I

knew Akasha when she walked this

earth. I was her slave. I am now

her enemy. I know what she is

capable of.

(CONTINUED)

79.

126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            126

ARMAND

Yes. We've all felt her presence,

even as she hides from us.

(as others nod,

acknowledging the

truth of this)

What does she want now?

MAHARET

She knows only one thing. Taking

pleasure in destroying life. She

is already killing the young ones

to build her strength.

MARIUS

She's sucked the life out of her

King like a praying mantis. I

sense she is getting closer.

MAHARET

She has come to destroy Lestat,

but he will only whet her thirst

more...

The Ancients look to each other, taking this in.

Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.

MAHARET

If we act together, we have a

chance to destroy her.

They all gaze at Maharet, astonished.

MAHARET

Yes! We must destroy her

immediately! If she is not

stopped, I'm afraid of what will

happen to the entire mortal world.

MAEL

But can she be destroyed? I am

left to bear the scars of the last

attempt on her life. She was

dragged into the sun. She

survived. But we almost didn't...

Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face.   They

all stare at him.

MARIUS

What happens to our Queen happens

to us. If Akasha dies, we die

as well.

(CONTINUED)

80.

126   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              126

MAHARET

Then so be it! We must take that

chance.

She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her

words sink in.

MAHARET

We must destroy Akasha. For the

sake of humanity! We must find

her. Now!

ARMAND

But perhaps she has come to kill

Lestat and then will go back to her

slumber. That is our only hope.

PANDORA

(eager)

Yes. That's right. She and the

covens will take care of that

brat. We must go to the concert

and pay our respects to our great

Queen.

MAHARET

How? With your own throat!

You've all been asleep too long!

You're still dreaming.

Marius steps up beside Maharet.

MARIUS

Maharet speaks the truth.   It is

our only hope.

Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman.

The others gaze at the three standing together now.

MAEL

No. Armand is right. We will go

to the concert and first see what

she does. There may be no need

for action.

Pandora and Armand nod their assent. The two groups face

each other. Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out

the words.

(CONTINUED)

81.

126   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             126

MAHARET

Then you go to the concert and you

shall see!

(shakes her head)

And I thought the Ancients became

wise with their years.

As we REMAIN ON the Ancient Ones, AKASHA'S HEARTBEAT

creeps back in over... Marius gazes again down at

Lestat's house, anguish on his face.

INT. MERCEDES - CLOSER ON ROGER - NIGHT

cruising the Hollywood streets, wearing sunglasses,

hat. He sees something.

ROGER'S POV

A Goth girl on the street in front of a record store.

BACK TO ROGER

He sighs, pulls over.    Gets out.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Behind him now we see a cab pull over. It's Jesse,

trailing Roger. She gazes at him intently.

JESSE'S POV

Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a

whisper.

BACK TO JESSE

Jesse pays the driver.    Gets out.   Gazes at Roger.

127   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - SOUND STUDIO - NIGHT      127

LOUD, intense MUSIC as the band rehearses. Lestat

creates a fantastic melody around the beat. He lets

the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the

REVERB still RINGING in the room. Lestat hears

something, turns. Outside, in the Hollywood Hills,

DOGS are HOWLING across the canyons like wolves.

Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...

82.

128   EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               128

Lestat stares out at the ominous night. As Maudy and the

band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night

get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The

song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the

band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes

back inside.

129   INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               129

Roger now stands there, a nervous look on his face.

ROGER

The... girls you asked for, Lestat.

They're here, in the guest wing.

LESTAT

Ah.   Yes.

Lestat gazes in that direction, pensive.

ROGER

I was uh... just gonna go catch a

movie at the Chinese. I don't

suppose you'd all want to...

Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.

LESTAT

No, thank you, Roger.   We'll

entertain ourselves.

As Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear

FAINT GIGGLING. Lestat turns back to the night. The

PULSE of Akasha still ECHOES in his ears.

130   INT. GUEST WING - JUST AFTER                                 130

Roger and Lestat walk in.   A young GROUPIE giggles

nervously.

GROUPIE #3

Oh my God, it's him!    It's really

him...

She turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to

her. Lestat stares, taken aback. It is Jesse. Dressed

in Goth gear. Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly. A

long moment.

LESTAT

Perhaps you would like a tour

of the place... first.

(CONTINUED)

83.

130   CONTINUED:                                                    130

GROUPIE #3

Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.

LESTAT

Roger... would you be so kind?

ROGER

(surprised, relieved)

Sure. Right this way, girls.

As they start off, Lestat puts up his hand, points to

Jesse.

LESTAT

Roger. Not that one.   Leave her

to me...

The other groupie pouts, disappointed. She goes out

with Roger. Lestat turns to Jesse... considers her...

LESTAT

You must be very keen to die.

Jesse's heart pounds with terror.

LESTAT

The Talamascans have become quite

stealthy. I didn't know

infiltration was quite their style.

JESSE

It's not. I... I came on my own.

He stares at her, taking her in.

LESTAT

How did you find me?

JESSE

I've been tracking your manager

for days...

(gesturing to her

Goth outfit)

Then I figured out you simply

have to look the part.

LESTAT

Clever librarian... You should

know, based on all your research,

that groupies don't ever find

their way out of here again.

(CONTINUED)

84.

130   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              130

JESSE

I'm not a groupie...

Lestat gazes at Jesse's pulsing jugular.      He steps

closer.

LESTAT

Then why are you following me?

What do you want?

JESSE

(terrified, in

a whisper)

Are you granting wishes?

LESTAT

(smiles, in a whisper

playing    with her)

Last wishes. What's yours?

JESSE

Show me what it's like to be you.

That's my last wish. Grant it,

Lestat.

He stares at her, feeling some connection with this

strange mortal girl. She stares at him with penetrating

eyes. He again finds himself drawn to her. Tries to

fight it.

LESTAT

(turning away)

I don't have time for this.

JESSE

All a vampire has is time.

LESTAT

Maybe not.

JESSE

(softly)

Right. The covens are coming for

you.

(softly)

I understand why you're doing it.

You have to be who you are, no

matter what happens.

He turns, gazes at her.       She steps forward.

(CONTINUED)

85.

130   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             130

JESSE

But how are you spending what may

be your last night on Earth,

Lestat? As you always have...

Alone.

Jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close,

stares up into his eyes. He stares down at her, amazed,

his heart pounding. He breathes in her hair, the scent

of her skin.

JESSE

Don't kill me yet. Let's spend

our last nights together. Share

it with me.   Show me what it's

like to be you.

LESTAT

You don't know what you're asking!

I don't know what's in that

librarian's head of yours, but it's

not what you think.

JESSE

That's right. You don't know

what's in my head, Lestat. Do

you want to?

LESTAT

I'll know when I kill you.

JESSE

Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to

get to know someone. Here. I'll

give you a preview. Coming

attractions. This is what you'll

find.

She crosses to him, stands close.

JESSE

I have this recurring dream that

I'm a child and I'm living in

this big house filled with

vampires. And every night when I

go to sleep, I wish to God the

same thing... you know what that

is, Lestat?

He gazes at her.    She leans forward.

(CONTINUED)

86.

130   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             130

JESSE

That I will have the dream again...

Because in the dream I'm happy.

And the dream is more real than my

life... I don't know how, but I

know you, Lestat... My life is a

big mystery and you, you have the

answer...

He gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it.

Jesse moves even closer. He stares down at her, the

softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat

of her body.

JESSE

I can't go on pretending this life

of mine is real. I can't live a

lie... I'm just like you Lestat.

We're the same...

LESTAT

(softly)

Are we? I seek the light.     You

seek the shadows.

JESSE

No. We're looking for exactly the

same thing. You know it...

Please. Show me.

He stares at her. Her eyes gazing directly into

his... Suddenly...

LESTAT

Alright!

Jesse breaks into a smile.

LESTAT

This may be painful for a mortal.

You're still attached to your skin.

JESSE

(an excited whisper)

I don't care.

LESTAT

Close your eyes.    Don't breathe.

Her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse

holds one deep, hesitant breath and... Flash -- with

preternatural speed --

87.

131   LESTAT AND JESSE                                               131

whisk through the night, flashing past trees and

houses. Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches

the world whiz past her at incredible speed and

suddenly -- they stop on a dime.

Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at

Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying

out before her like a glimmering blanket.

132   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT                         132

Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't

believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by

the experience.

JESSE

Do that again!

Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For

a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each

other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her.

She knows it. He turns away.

LESTAT

And now for my next trick.

Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.

Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something

stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She

stares, impressed.

JESSE

Did it hurt?

LESTAT

Yes. For just a moment. But as

the pain is more intense for us,

so is ecstacy.

(gazes at her)

You see, we love our victims.

JESSE

Love?    I thought it was the blood.

LESTAT

No, although the taste is so rich

and sweet. Love is the essence of

the dark gift. The connection is

so much more satisfying, brief as

it is, than anything else.

(CONTINUED)

88.

132   CONTINUED:                                                          132

Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular,

the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her

neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch,

terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips

against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her

arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm

of his voice.

LESTAT

As you drink, you feel the heart

weakening... it struggles even

though there's no hope. You feel

the life slipping away, the flash

of those brief years. The taste

of mortality you can no longer

experience... and it is

beautiful...

(pulls away sharply)

No 'relationship,' no commingling

can ever reach the heights of that

experience.

But Jesse steps forward.       Lestat turns, stares at her.

Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.

One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens

her blouse down to her navel.

Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin

from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about

her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at

Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.

With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the

point across her breast. She inhales through clenched

teeth... then settles as we see:

The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,

like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping

down her chest.

Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her

gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound

itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her

face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She

shivers...

LESTAT

(groans)

Your blood...

JESSE

(murmurs)

Do you like it?

(CONTINUED)

89.

132   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              132

LESTAT

(losing himself)

Yes...

He comes down to her slender neck.     Stares at the soft,

pulsing skin. He bares his fangs.

JESSE

(whispering, overcome)

Do it to me... Please... With your

blood I'll know you...

133   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                133

He can't help himself.    He moves to Jesse's white neck...

closer... closer...

JESSE

I'll know everything...

But suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he

tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a

desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him,

surprised. He looms over her, angry.

LESTAT

You want to know everything. You

want to see what it's like. Then

come! I'll show you.

134   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT                                     134

Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat

stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark.

Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to

her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving

across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman

giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she

realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves

forward. Jesse gingerly follows.

Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite

her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches,

fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's

presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes

shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a

street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the

vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone.

Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too.

Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over

the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to

see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the

bench.

134   CONTINUED:                                                    134

JESSE

Is she alright?

Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained

lips. Jesse reflexively looks away.

LESTAT

Come closer, Jesse. You want to

see? You want to know?

JESSE

Lestat, no!

Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his

back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The

woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as...

the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens...

finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm.

Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his

mouth, approaches Jesse.

LESTAT

You see now? Are you ready?     Now

do you want it?!

He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately

wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in

Jesse's face says it all.

LESTAT

No.   Of course you don't.

She backs away from him, now terrified. Something's

changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank.

LESTAT

Well I didn't grant your final

wish.

(shakes his head)

It was an impossible wish to begin

with. You see, I am unknowable.

His eyes still as death, he starts moving away.

JESSE

Lestat!    Wait!

Lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully,

pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.

LESTAT

Good-bye, Talamascan.

(CONTINUED)

91.

134   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             134

Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is

about to be over.

Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched

by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing

her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is

completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she

realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat

disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH

and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams,

backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but

Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides

towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her

cries... WHOOSH.

PULL BACK to reveal a porcelain doll, beautiful, perfect

but unsettling. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls

from different eras. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to-

ceiling curtains to reveal Jesse -- still an adult, but

lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl.

Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood

memory. Is she dreaming now?

138   INT. DESERT MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         138

Making her way down a long hall she passes an amazing

array of medieval tapestries.

139   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                      139

Jesse as a child picking at the thread of a wall-hanging

in a large room.

140   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                       140

She stands wondering -- eyes moving back and forth with

rapid thoughts when... She sees a door at the end of the

hall. Walking a little faster now, she draws toward it

as...

92.

141   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                       141

Jesse as a little girl, wanders down a similar hall

toward what sounds like a COCKTAIL PARTY. Reaching the

thick wooden door she peeps through to see...

142   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        142

Jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far

wall -- a mural of names, a family tree -- extending up

onto the ceiling and down to the floor.

143   FLASHBACK - MURAL                                              143

Jesse, as a little girl, walking beside Maharet, looks up

at the mural.

YOUNG JESSE

(furious)

Why can't I stay with you?!

Please, Auntie Maharet!

MAHARET

I don't want you to go, but you

must.

A tear of blood trickles down Maharet's cheek.

YOUNG JESSE

Auntie, you're bleeding...

Jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but

Maharet violently grabs her hand. Young Jesse is

frightened.

MAHARET

You must be with your own, my

sweetest girl. I'll always be

watching over you.

YOUNG JESSE

I want to stay with you forever.

144   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        144

Jesse stares into nothingness.   Again the voice, but much

gentler.

MAHARET

Forever is a very long time.

Jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway

down the end of the hall...

MAHARET

Hello, my princess.

JESSE

Aunt Maharet?

Jesse rushes to her. Stops. Stares at her aunt's

glowing eyes, the strange pallor of her skin.

JESSE

You're a...?

MAHARET

Yes. Oh, Jesse, I've missed you

so much, but I had to keep this

from you.

Jesse stands there, soaking it in.    Maharet takes her

hands gently.

JESSE

Oh my God, this is why... I knew I

was different. I knew --

MAHARET

(strongly)

Come...

Jesse follows Maharet to the mural of the family tree.

MAHARET

You are the most precious of my

great family...

JESSE

Am I...?

MAHARET

(strongly)

No. You are not. I was once

mortal, too. My sister died

before her child was one year old.

I took care of that child, and her

children, and her children's

children...

Pointing up to the huge family tree...

MAHARET

This is our family -- my way of

coping with eternity. The

labyrinth of life. The family

teaches me the rhythms and

passions of each age.

Her finger trails down the great line to a name --

"Jessica Reeves"...

MAHARET

You are my most prized light. You

are what keeps me connected to the

world of the living.

Jesse stares at Maharet, amazed.

MAHARET

When your parents died I took you

to India to take care of you.

JESSE

And something happened there.

MAHARET

I stopped it from happening.    And

I will again.

Maharet stands close, gazes at her.

MAHARET

Jesse, you must stay away from

Lestat. You must forget all about

him.

Jesse looks at her, surprised.    Maharet smiles.

MAHARET

Yes, I know about your new friend.

You think you love him, but it's

not as you thought it would be.

Jesse stares at Maharet, surprised she understands so

well.

JESSE

I thought I was like him.

MAHARET

I know, but it is not who you are,

not who you are meant to be. You

have found that out now.

Jesse sits on a stone bench, confused.       Maharet smiles

sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil.

JESSE

Lestat's all I can think about...

I felt like I belonged with him.

Now I know why...

(CONTINUED)

95.

144   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             144

Maharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically.

MAHARET

Jesse, you must forget about him.

You must trust me...

JESSE

(gazes up at her

a long moment)

I missed you so much, Aunt

Maharet.

MAHARET

Me too.

Just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to

illuminate the windows of the great hall.

MAHARET

You will go home to London in the

morning.

Jesse holds Maharet's eyes.

JESSE

But this is my home. This is

where I belong. Why do you want

to get rid of me so quickly?

Maharet touches her face gently.

MAHARET

Now is not the time to be here...

The light is getting brighter.    Maharet stands.

MAHARET

You were seeking answers. Now

you have found them. The family

is who you are.

Maharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse.

Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the

embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. Then, beaten

by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns

back to Jesse, gazes at her.

MAHARET

You will go home to London

tomorrow.

96.

145   INT. LESTAT'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     145

Lestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a

long mournful note. He stops a moment, lost in his

thoughts. A flash of the first morning light reflects

off the ancient wood. Lestat puts the violin away. A

tear of blood trickles down his cheek. His face is

filled with sadness at what will never be. A word

escapes from his lips.

LESTAT

(whisper)

Jesse.

Lestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where

his coffin sits in the safety of darkness.

146   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                            146

The sun breaks through the date palms.

147   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      147

Jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires.

She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass

over the painting catches Jesse's reflection. Jesse

moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's. In

the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's

luminescence. Jesse stares a long, long moment.

148   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      148

Jesse sits at a desk, writing a note, torment, confusion

on her face.

JESSE (V.O.)

Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life,

I've felt... kind of crazy I

guess, different from everyone,

and now I know why... You say I

now know who I am meant to be...

I have found my answers. You are

right...

She takes a deep breath.

149   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE -               149

CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jesse moves to the front entrance, gazes at the walls

surrounding the front gate.

JESSE (V.O.)

I know you want me to be a regular

human girl... but I'm not. I

can't be...

She looks back at the house, then quickly slips out the

gate.

150   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                          150

Maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty

desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see.

JESSE (V.O.)

Lestat is my destiny... I know

that now. I love you, Aunt

Maharet. Good-bye.

Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway,

she reads a sign -- "DEATH VALLEY 120 miles." Just then,

a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction.

She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop

on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER

leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid

with white face-paint and fake fangs.

VAMPIRE DRIVER

Need a ride?

Jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake

vampires. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT BLARES FROM the SPEAKERS.

JESSE

(smiles)

Yeah.

151   EXT. DEATH VALLEY - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DUSK                   151

We see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road

toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.

A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is

heard. As we FLY CLOSER, the DRUMMING becomes LOUDER and

clearer. Until we are RIGHT ABOVE an incredible scene...

A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.

CUT TO:

152   EXT. CONCERT ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                152

Looking at the scene, Jesse is bedazzled. Pushing

through people, she disappears into the throng as...

Jesse!

153   ANGLE ON DAVID TALBOT                                          153

as he pushes through the sea of white paint and plastic

vampire teeth. But she has disappeared. Talbot is

jostled, dropping his glasses on the ground.

VOICE (O.S.)

Sorry, Grandpa!

Talbot crouches down and finds his glasses.     Reemerging,

he senses something and looks up.

154   FULL SHOT - MARIUS                                             154

watching him at a distance. Next to the real thing, all

these fake vampires look ridiculous.

MARIUS

(quietly)

Hello, David.

155   ON TALBOT                                                      155

Speechless.

MARIUS

I must show you my new paintings

sometime.

Marius smiles. Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a

lifetime's searching. He tries to say something, but

it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the

crowd at unnatural speed. Enormous pipes spout flames

high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light

along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian

effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the

top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of

human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline.

Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the

strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles

around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.

The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit   -- naked

bodies walk across heads of people while others   get

tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to    get

what they were promised... Nothing like they've   ever

seen.

155   CONTINUED:                                                  155

A new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow

managed to include themselves in the select number of

attendees to a sacred rite. And among the mortals are

the immortals. Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires,

the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks

which they use to hide their knives and sickles.

156   HIGH ABOVE VALLEY                                           156

Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires,

except for Maharet. Some of whom can't help but smile

at the scene below. Marius is now with them.

PANDORA

(wistful, to Mael)

It's just like Nero's day.

They scan the horizon, the darkening sky.

MAHARET

Akasha will not be able to resist

this...

The CROWD begins to CLAP -- DRUMS from different circles

begin to impatiently BEAT into one deafening rhythm.

157   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                      157

Backstage is all abuzz with pre-show energy; press

everywhere. Roger still worrying and sweating. James,

Alex and Maudy sit in their own circle, jamming with

their unplugged instruments, psyching themselves up for

the biggest night of their lives.

158   INT. LESTAT'S HONEY-WAGON - NIGHT                           158

Lestat stretches out with his eyes closed as the sounds

of the DRUMMING crowd begin to make the whole van

shudder. Roger pops his head in.

ROGER

They're getting pretty worked up

out there.

159   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                      159

Lestat emerges from his honey-wagon, splendid in his

concert costume. He looks ready for business, whatever

may happen. The band look at each other, then look to

Lestat. This is the moment. He smiles like a father

Alex, Maudy and James start beating out the rhythm with

the crowd as they move through backstage. The DRUM BEATS

RISE to a CRESCENDO.

160   BACK TO CROWD                                                160

Jesse makes her way through the throng, trying to get

closer to the stage. Suddenly the torches go out sending

the place into utter darkness. A stunned moment. The

place goes berserk. We see the dim figures of the band

take their places. Jesse desperately tries to push

toward the front.

161   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                       161

Lestat readies himself as he scans the valley from behind

a speaker, and sees...

162   LESTAT'S POV - VAMPIRES                                      162

164   BACK IN CROWD                                                164

BOOM, the torches relight and an enormous CHORD surges

through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff. The mass

surges forward... The stage lights up in a huge halo of

blood-red light. The band plays a hypnotic tune that

would put the devil in a spell, as... We wait for Lestat.

The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as...

The audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over

the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley

is shaking, when... Lestat appears above the stage,

inhumanly levitating and...

LESTAT

I'm so glad I decided to rise...

After tonight, Death Valley will

live up to its name!

The place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks

it in.

He swoops down through the air over the stage and into

their very midst. Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to

him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams

for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips

into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note,

filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be

replaced with hell.

165   AT BACK OF CONCERT - MIXING BOARD                            165

Two STUDIO ENGINEERS sit dazed.

Could we turn it down a tad?

The second Engineer looks to the mixing panel.

ENGINEER #2

His mic's not even up.

They stare, dumbfounded.

166   BACK TO CONCERT                                              166

The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole

place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the

energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front

of this papal devil. All move and sway except for...

Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get

closer and closer to...

Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice.

Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. Lestat's

dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into

an even higher unworldly octave, and then...

167   LESTAT'S POV                                                 167

The vampires move through the crowd. Goth girls in the

front row, weeping... Maudy, James and Alex off in the

clouds, playing the best music of their lives. The

place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as

waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into

the night sky.

168   BACK TO SCENE                                                    168

LESTAT

You want more?!

The crowd screams...

CROWD

Yes!

LESTAT

This one's for those who've come

for me!

All yell that they have, but the covens know it's for

them. Lestat launches the band into a new number that

makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the

coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to

them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting

them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the

assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no...

The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to

move through the crowd toward the stage. We RISE UP OVER

the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural

speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage.

CUT TO:

169   ANCIENTS - NIGHT                                                 169

Marius spies the covens slipping through the crowd at a

strange velocity. He looks to Lestat, worried...

The assassins approach closer   -- Lestat assaults with

relentless lyrics... Reaching   the stage, they are

suddenly on it -- roadies run   in and are immediately

cast aside by inhuman powers.    We speed into vampire

time as... (NOTE: In camera,    no C.G.I.)

The assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to

dismember Lestat. Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging

the knives. He rips the microphone from the stand and

holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled.

The assassin squirms and convulses. The crowd goes

insane... Lestat snarls at the audience as if this

really were part of the performance... The assassins

attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands

like they were small spears. Lestat dodges them.

The assassins BREAK GLASS BOTTLES, lunge with the deadly shards.

(NOTE: Band should not be seen in this part of sequence.)

171   MARIUS                                                             171

can hold himself back no longer. He flies over equipment

and roadies, up into the air. The Ancients gaze after

him and...

172   ON STAGE                                                           172

He lands square in the middle of the fray. Back to

mortal time. The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance

of the figure on stage, loving the show. Lestat grins at

Marius. The band keeps playing. Marius hurls a huge

LIGHT at the assassins. It EXPLODES as it hits them,

pinning one with shards. But an assassin hurls a sickle

at Lestat. Lestat is struck down, his singing stopped.

The assassins move in.

CUT TO:

173   ANCIENT VAMPIRES                                                   173

watch from their rocks.       Pandora's face, filled with

excitement.

PANDORA

There are too many of them!

They're going to dismember him.

Armand is enjoying the show.

ARMAND

Good!

174   BACK TO STAGE                                                      174

Assassins corner Lestat and Marius -- blades, broken

bottles reflecting the spotlight. Lestat raises his arms

for the crowd. The crowd jeers. Lestat looks to Maudy

and the band.

LESTAT

Get out of here!

The band scampers off stage as the assassins fly past,

the reverb from their guitars whistle into a deafening

pitch.

Jesse joins the screaming crowds.

JESSE

Lestat!    Lestat!

(CONTINUED)

104.

174   CONTINUED:                                                   174

As the killer vampires make their final move, it looks

bleak for Lestat... But one after the other they

spontaneously combust, turning hot-white to black ash

and drift up into the air like strange supernatural

kites. The crowd hollers and screams, not quite

believing what they saw or how it was done, when...

Down in the throng, vampires also begin to combust -- hot

flashes of white exploding through the crowd, turning

into black paper dolls -- wafting up over the valley --

crumbling into fluttering puffs of soot. Panic takes

over the mass of people, running in all directions.

Jesse remains pinned to her spot.

175   LESTAT                                                       175

stands in wonder as Marius stares up into the high

darkness.

MARIUS

(soft, to himself)

Akasha.

The valley fills with hundreds of burning "kites"

floating like black ghosts. Khayman, Pandora and

Armand gaze up at the sky.

MAHARET

She is here...

176   JESSE                                                        176

stares in wonder and terror at the burning "kites." Then

seizes her chance. She pushes toward the stage against

the tide of bodies fleeing.

177   INT. BACKSTAGE - MEANWHILE                                   177

Roger is trying to manage the building chaos backstage as

the FIRE MARSHAL and several firemen follow after him.

FIRE MARSHAL

You don't have a permit for any of

these stunts!

ROGER

I told you I don't know anything

about it!

A WALKIE-TALKIE distracts the Fire Marshal long enough to

allow Roger to run.

(CONTINUED)

105.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

ROGER

Last time I work for a bloody

vampire...

Looking up at the sky, he stares in awe... There is a low

powerful RUMBLE...

The mortal crowd looks around, distracted from their

panic, as they sense something truly awesome...

178   LESTAT                                                          178

senses it too. He looks up, not knowing from which

direction the attack will come. The STAGE starts to

SHUDDER and SHAKE violently...

Jesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him.

JESSE

Lestat!    Lestat!

Suddenly the wooden platform beneath Lestat begins to

buckle under his feet. Fragments of WOOD EXPLODE upwards

around Lestat. Marius loses his balance and staggers

backwards...

Fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience. Jesse

raises her hands to protect herself. She looks up.

Freezes. Akasha rises up through the stage. Beautiful

and terrifying. She grabs Lestat and the two of them

shoot up into the air. The crowd stares in awe. Jesse

is frozen.

Roger, the Fire Marshal, the band, everyone is frozen.

Talbot stares up at Akasha, his face white, unable to

believe his eyes. Even the Ancient Ones are stunned to

see their Queen come to life.

Scaffolds collapse in an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL

SPARKS... (NOTE: Practical explosion.) The Ancient

Ones stare up into the sky as... Akasha and Lestat

vanish. Jesse stares in horror after them.

179   EXT. SKY - EVENING                                              179

BLACKNESS.

180   EXT. DEATH VALLEY PEAK - NIGHT                                  180

Lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the

desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below.

(CONTINUED)

106.

180   CONTINUED:                                                      180

Lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him Akasha in

an extravagant Egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold

draping her godly form. Lestat is awestruck. Akasha

comes to life...

LESTAT

Akasha...

Akasha still says nothing -- she advances with a

luscious, curling smile.

AKASHA

Why so surprised, my love?    You

called, and I have come.

Lestat is awestruck. There is such an unearthly power in

Akasha's voice. Everything seems to hum and vibrate with

her breath.

AKASHA

Never fear me, Lestat. Your

wishes have all come true.

LESTAT

My wishes...?

AKASHA

You have yearned for a companion

to share eternity. You have cried

out to the world. I have answered

your call.

Akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat.

AKASHA

You are so bold, like your music.

It woke me. You live your life in

the open, like I did long ago,

when I had a King.

LESTAT

Had a King?

AKASHA

He's no more. You are my consort.

I've kept you safe -- alive.

LESTAT

You?

(CONTINUED)

107.

180   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              180

AKASHA

You thought it was all you?

(laughing)

You have the ego of a king as

well. I know you, Lestat. I know

that you crave to have the world

at your feet. I have come to give

it to you.

Akasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across

her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it,

as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at

it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around

Lestat, she braces him, licks his face.

AKASHA

Has your tongue lost its taste for

blood?

LESTAT

(melting)

Never.

AKASHA

But you didn't kill the mortal

girl.

Lestat looks caught.

AKASHA

Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss

me.

(NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night

sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him,

hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill

into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to

meet her as...

Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until

their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into

him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers

in him and floods his body with an electric rush.

AKASHA

Be my King. Forget about

everything else.

Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.    His

eyes are empty of everything except her blood.

AKASHA

What's your answer?

(CONTINUED)

108.

180   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            180

Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth

spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe

over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a

powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin

together, detached from time and space.

181   FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE                                   181

All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching.

Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and

lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest,

his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins.

Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly

through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of

his hand.

LESTAT

Can we try that again?

Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a

kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual

hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and

scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.

LESTAT

Show me the world...

Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up

into the air and off into the night.

182   INT. MAHARET DESERT MANSION - NIGHT                          182

Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what

looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes

widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora,

Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered

before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS

OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch

down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room

after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved.

Maharet turns to them.

MAHARET

We see now what Akasha means to

do. Rule as Queen again.

(pointing to the

great family)

This is why we must fight Akasha!

Maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the

immortals.

(CONTINUED)

109.

182   CONTINUED:                                                   182

MAHARET

For the sake of all mortals. She

must be stopped, or the mortal

world will end.

The Ancients fall silent as they take this in. They gaze

again at Maharet's Great Family, humbled for a moment by

her life's passion.

MAEL

But is there a way?   We don't

know.

KHAYMAN

When she opens herself to give her

blood, she is vulnerable.

MARIUS

Then we weaken her. Drain her of

almost all her blood, but leave

her just one drop.

MAHARET

We can't take that chance.    We

must finish her.

ARMAND

If she dies, we all die.

PANDORA

We're damned no matter what

happens.

MAHARET

Perhaps.

Maharet gazes at them, her mind working... Pandora,

Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain.

JESSE

And what about Lestat?

MAHARET

Lestat has joined with Akasha. He

is lost to us now. He is never

coming back.

JESSE

I don't believe that.

183   LESTAT                                                         183

Beaming with a possessed look, his eyes brimming with

visions.

Lestat opens his eyes and sees an island approaching.   In

the distance lights sparkle as an enormous plantation

villa is revealed, nestled into the far shore.

CUT TO:

184   EXT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         184

Lestat and Akasha stand on a cliff-top. WIND rips

through the trees. Everywhere, there are torches, and a

million candles light the vast house. Lestat and Akasha

glide past the forest of exotic flowers... Past the

fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French

doors. Long white curtains billow in the sea wind.

LESTAT

Where are we?

AKASHA

We are home.

LESTAT

You live here?

AKASHA

We live everywhere and anywhere we

choose. The world is our garden.

185   INT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         185

Lestat steps in through billowing curtains, stops...

There are three West Indian girls, young, voluptuous,

beautiful, dressed in simple working clothes and

traditional head-wraps. They stare at Lestat, nervous,

yet fascinated. They move towards him. Lestat finds

himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching

beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body. He

swoons, closes his eyes, smiles.

LESTAT

So warm...

(sniffs their skin)

... their blood...

AKASHA

... yes...

LESTAT

... they're mortal...

(CONTINUED)

185   CONTINUED:                                                     185

AKASHA

... of course. They serve the

living goddess, and her consort.

They find you beautiful. You are

a god in their eyes.

DISSOLVE TO:

186   SERIES OF SHOTS                                                186

... golden dark hands pull clothes away from Lestat's

white skin... breasts strain through white linen as they

press themselves closer to him... the surface of water,

scented with red rose petals. Lestat's white skin breaks

the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin

alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water...

the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as

girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach

down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes

remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha

kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek.

Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she

kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he

can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his

neck, his chest, bites... Lestat arches in ecstasy...

Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips,

smiles, goes back down and drinks.

DISSOLVE TO:

187   AKASHA AND LESTAT - LATER                                      187

now moved to the bed, surrounded by the fine nets...

kissing, probing each other's bodies, floating above the

bed... Akasha rolls him over -- smiles down at him -- a

fang exposed... She draws her wrist across her mouth... a

globule of blood smacks Lestat's open lips... Flash --

A thousand images in a second. Lestat jolted as if by a

million volts. Blood smears their bodies -- they bathe

in it.

188   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                188

The most lascivious smile spreading over his face, even

as the waves of pleasure still course through him,

causing his mouth to twitch and tremble. He closes his

eyes...

FADE TO BLACK.

112.

FADE IN:

189   SAME SCENE - LESTAT (LATER)                                     189

opens his eyes. He sits up alone in the canopied bed,

disoriented. Akasha is nowhere to be seen. He looks

toward the window. The sun is just about to disappear

below the horizon. Lestat stares, amazed, blinking...

Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe

at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the

sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels

the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's

craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes,

blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the

bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates... The

servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around

the edge of the bath. The roses are now black and the

water is colored a rich deep red...

190   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - HALLWAY                                 190

Lestat steps into the hallway, stares at dead bodies

sprinkling the ground -- both servants formally dressed,

and guests in white tropical evening dress...

191   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION         191

The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread

across the lace cloth. Food sits uneaten on plates. The

last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting

around the table, some slumped onto their food, some

frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a

feeling of dread spreading. We FOLLOW as he moves...

192   EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                  192

... out the French windows onto the beach, bodies of

servants and villagers are scattered. Lestat's feet step

down the wooden stairs, onto the sand, through the

bodies...

Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the

pink sky.

AKASHA

Behold our Kingdom.

Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach.

LESTAT

Why?

192   CONTINUED:                                                      192

AKASHA

(puzzled)

Why not?

LESTAT

This is the reason you have risen?

AKASHA

They believed in nothing, now they

are nothing. But you and I will

change all that. We will give the

world something to believe in

again.

Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist

with a knife. Lestat stares at her dripping blood.

She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts

her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's

eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost

again. Akasha smiles.

AKASHA

Come, my King.      We have a score to

settle.

The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness.

193   INT. MAHARET'S MANSION - GRANDE HALL - NIGHT                    193

The Ancients are still debating. Suddenly, the whole

place begins to shake. (NOTE: Practical shadows not

C.G.I.) A shadow passes over the Ancients' faces.

MARIUS

She comes...

The WINDOWS along one side of the hall EXPLODE with a

startling GUST. The Ancient Ones look up to see...

Akasha's silhouette looming, dark and foreboding.

AKASHA

My children. It warms my blood to

see you all gathered... plotting

against me.

They trade glances and begin to fan out around the room.

MAHARET

Akasha.

AKASHA

Maharet. You will address my

King first...

(CONTINUED)

114.

193   CONTINUED:                                                       193

Lestat enters, his possessed eyes showing only evil now.

Unable to help herself...

JESSE

Lestat!

He turns slowly to the corner where she sits.      They lock

eyes. Lestat's face stares cold and hard.

JESSE

What has she done to you?

LESTAT

Made me see.

Taking his arm, Akasha draws Lestat to her. The Ancient

Vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval

weapons hanging on the walls, as Marius moves toward his

son.

MARIUS

Lestat... step aside.

LESTAT

Never.    She is my Queen.

Marius looks for some recognition in Lestat's eyes.

There is none. Maharet turns to Akasha.

MAHARET

Akasha. The world has changed

since you reigned.

AKASHA

Then we shall change it back.

Humans are animals, brute

creatures. Their destruction can

only make sense.

MAHARET

We've found other ways to co-

exist.

AKASHA

Yes. In the shadows. In silence.

In shame. For what? For respect

of mortals? They are nothing to

us. They are only... food.

She casts a dangerous eye towards Jesse. Maharet

instinctively moves forward to protect her.

(CONTINUED)

115.

193   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             193

AKASHA

Poor Maharet. Still trying to

hold onto what I took from you.

Maharet doesn't even flinch.

MARIUS

Akasha, please...

AKASHA

(venomous)

You think you can change my will?

I'm tired of this discussion.

Join me, or die.

MAHARET

I will not.

MARIUS

I will not.

AKASHA

I want to hear it from every one

of you. What will it be?

Akasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring

deep into their souls. Akasha sees Khayman glance at the

family tree. Akasha's eyes blaze with anger.

AKASHA

Don't tell me, you have feelings

for these ridiculous mortals!

She crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to

one. Jessica Reeves. Akasha is beyond fury, yet she

keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat.

AKASHA

Do you love me?

Smiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood

glisten there, tempting Lestat.

LESTAT

Yes...

He draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and

Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away.

Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.

AKASHA

Prove it. Kill her.

(CONTINUED)

116.

193   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               193

LESTAT

She's nothing to me.

AKASHA

Just the same, I'd like you to

kill her. For me.

(to the Ancients)

I've had enough of this 'great

family.' It's time to end it.

Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse.

MAHARET

You will not touch her!

Akasha flicks her wrist. Maharet is hurled against a

pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand.

AKASHA

You still think to challenge me,

Maharet?

MAHARET

I beg you, spare this child.

AKASHA

Now.

Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong.     Jesse gazes

at Lestat. Then steps forward.

JESSE

It's all right, Maharet.

Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's

newly strong and calm voice. Jesse looks to Lestat,

straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely

unwavering.

JESSE

It's what I want.   I am ready.

She reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top

of her breast. A thin, red scar remains from where she

cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese

barrette.

Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. Jesse keeps her

gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything.

AKASHA

(smirking)

How sweet...

(CONTINUED)

117.

193   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                193

Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her

eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on...

Jesse watches him with absolute love. He reaches her.

Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her

halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but

Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck

to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased

as...

Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps

with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws

her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she

holds him.

With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep

blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at

the mural as...

Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy,

clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper

into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being

drawn down until finally...

Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.    Dead.

AKASHA

Good-bye, great family.

She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It

EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground.

Maharet stares in horror.

AKASHA

Now, my children, remember your

real family! Or else.

She turns to them with a killing smile.

LESTAT

But, My Queen, you've forgotten my

reward!

She turns to him.

AKASHA

That's right. My King, you've

just earned your crown.

Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth. Akasha

approaches Lestat and offers him her vein. She looks

scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...

AKASHA

You see how he obeys.    You will or

you will all die!

Lestat looks once at Marius, then sinks his teeth into

its original font. He drinks as Akasha gasps with

pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. She keeps

smiling to the others. But Lestat doesn't stop drinking.

Akasha looks back to him, her face changing.

AKASHA

That's enough, Lestat.

Still Lestat doesn't stop.

AKASHA

Lestat.    Enough.   Stop!

what was analyzed in boards. Notable potential expense

or savings indicated with brackets. [])

But Lestat clamps down even harder.       Akasha thrashes,

trying to release herself.

Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the

chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal

passes between them as...

The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha

looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius,

Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her.

Akasha lets out a hiss...

Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael

ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams,

the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood

were burning acid...

Pandora too bursts into flames.       She falls to the ground.

But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold

and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again.

They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air,

thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass

of flailing limbs.

The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to

drain her...

Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him. Flash. He

screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his

fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite... His wounds quickly

heal. He moves in for another attack...]

The Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great

strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally

begins to subside. The mass of bodies sinks to the

ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that...

Akasha's skin is deathly blue white.    In horror, she

manages to spit out her words.

AKASHA

You kill me, you kill yourselves.

The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment.

Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze

on Lestat. He gazes back at her.

Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare

green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries

out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs.

Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat,

this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat.

He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat.

Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real

fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.

MAHARET

Wait, Lestat! You must stop!

Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted,

unnatural angle.

They all stare waiting to see what will happen...

... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha

and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles

but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not

stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room.

The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe.

Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see...

Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and

cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from

the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to

transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin

returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures.

Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on

the stone floor like porcelain.

A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other,

astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."

KHAYMAN

(whisper)

We survived!

The Ancients let out relieved hisses.

But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to

her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the

floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to

Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down

to her ear and whispers.

LESTAT

I left you one drop, my love.

Drink deep and live.

Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the

blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then

finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her.

She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes.

JESSE

I thought I'd lost you...

LESTAT

Drink, my love.

Her lips move to his wrist. Lestat strokes her hair,

soothes her. Jesse gasps as pain courses through her.

Lestat holds her close. She looks up at him, their eyes

are locked together.

LESTAT

I will never leave you again.

He holds her tight in his arms.

All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what

he did.

Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her

eyes glowing. Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All

the Ancients turn, follow her gaze.

A whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin.

Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to

stone. Jesse goes to her.

JESSE

Maharet...

MAHARET

My child, let me look at you...

You are finally happy. It is as

it should be now... I will watch

over you always.

Maharet reaches out, embraces Jesse. Then Maharet sinks

into a chair and freezes into a statue.

ARMAND

(a reverent whisper)

She took Akasha's last drop, took

Akasha's death into herself.

Behold, our Queen... our new

mother...

The Ancients slowly bow to Maharet. Jesse slowly slips

from Maharet's arms. Goes into Lestat's arms.

JESSE

Is she... dead?

KHAYMAN

No, she will live forever. She

sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of

us.

Jesse and Lestat hold onto each other, gazing at

Maharet's face. On Maharet's lips is the most content of

smiles. Jesse wipes away a tear.

Marius turns to Lestat.    Their eyes meet.     Then Marius

bows at Maharet's feet.

MARIUS

My Queen, I will watch over you

always.

DISSOLVE TO:

194   EXT. TALAMASCA HEADQUARTERS (LONDON) - EVENING                       194

The sun has long disappeared as the darkness settles.

195   INT. TALAMASCA HEADQUARTERS - EVENING                                195

The shadows creep up the doorway.

196   INT. TALBOT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             196

Talbot sits at his desk covered with news clippings.

197   CLOSE ON CLIPPINGS                                           197

Images from the concert... "Mass Hysteria"... "Rock 'n'

Roll Nightmare"... "Drugs in Water Supply"... The

headline "Band starts World Tour but where is Lestat?"...

JESSE (O.S.)

Good question...

198   BACK TO SCENE                                                198

Talbot looks up to see Jesse and Lestat looking over his

shoulder. He leaps out of his seat. Sees the change in

her instantly.

TALBOT

Jesse.     My God...

JESSE

(smiles)

David, this is Lestat.

He looks at Lestat, fear in his eyes.

TALBOT

How do you do?

LESTAT

Charmed, I'm sure.

JESSE

I told you I'd return with my

findings. Here they are.

David stares, shaken.

TALBOT

But please, sit down. You'll have

to excuse me... it's just so...

so...

LESTAT

Unexpected?

TALBOT

Strangely, no...

David looks sadly at Jesse.

JESSE

Please don't be sad. I'm where I

belong. I'm happy now.

198   CONTINUED:                                                   198

Lestat, content for the first time since we've known him,

looks lovingly to Jesse. A flicker of curiosity crosses

David's face.

TALBOT

Excuse me for asking but...

JESSE

(smiles)

What's it like?

TALBOT

Yes.

JESSE

Do you want to find out?

TALBOT

Me?... No. I'm too old to live

forever.

JESSE

Well, if you ever should change

your mind... Oh. I have a present

for you. From an old friend.

She hands Talbot a canvas. It's a painting. He stares at

it. The painting shows Lestat's concert. And in the

crowd, Talbot finds Marius, now looking straight out at

the viewer, a smile on his lips. Talbot sees standing

beside Marius is Talbot himself, dancing with a young,

pretty Goth. Talbot smiles.

JESSE

And Marius sent a message. You

were right. He doesn't go to the

Dorchester. But he's gonna be at

Claridge's later...

Talbot stares at them.

JESSE

Well, I guess this is good-bye.

TALBOT

Yes.   Take care of her, Lestat.

LESTAT

Always.

Talbot looks at Jesse, once his spiritual daughter.

TALBOT

Good-bye, Jesse.

(CONTINUED)

124.

198   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            198

Talbot closes his eyes to shut out a tear, and Jesse is

at his side and leans down to whisper in his ear...

JESSE

Good-bye, dear friend.

Talbot opens his eyes to say something, but they're gone.

Talbot turns to the painting. Stares at Marius for a

long moment. Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the

door.

199   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                   199

Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters.

He takes her hand and together they float up over the

wall and out to the street. Lestat pulls Jesse into his

arms.

They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away,

gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...

And exchange happy, fanged smiles...

LESTAT

Shall we go get a drink, love?

She smiles, nods. Lestat and Jesse take each other's

hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets

at that STRANGE preternatural SPEED...

... and vanish into the night.

FADE OUT.

THE END
