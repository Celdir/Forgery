FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

JIM

Well...how do you feel?

SUZY

Ask me in about five minutes.

JIM

I'm talking about graduation. Being

totally free to do whatever we want

now.

SUZY

It feels excellent.

JIM

Gotta throw the anchor over.

SUZY

What's wrong?

JIM

Nothing.

SUZY

C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering

you.

JIM

It's just that we're right around that

old summer camp where all those

murders took place.

SUZY

What murders?

JIM

Never mind, you don't want to know

about it.

SUZY

Tell me.

JIM

There's nothing to worry about, Suzy.

The guy's dead now, somewhere at the

bottom of this lake...if you believe

the stories.

(beat)

Let's drop it, okay?

SUZY

What stories?

JIM

There was this boy named Jason

Voorhees who drowned in Crystal

Lake...

YOUNG JASON

Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

JIM (V.O.)

None of the counselors heard him.

YOUNG JASON

Mmmmmmommy....

JIM

A bunch of years went by and everybody

forgot about it.

(beat)

That's when the murders started.

SUZY

Jason did it...?

JIM'

That's what some people thought. But

they were wrong.

JIM

His mother blamed the counselors for

his death and tried to kill them all.

(dramatic pause)

She got her head chopped off by one of

them.

SUZY

So the murders stopped?

JIM

No.

JIM

Legend has it that Jason came back to

avenge his mother's death, vowing to

kill every teenager from the area.

(beat)

And every now and then, the murders

start up again.

JIM

Forget about it, Suzy. They're just

stories.

SUZY

We're the last graduating class,

right?

JIM

Right.

SUZY

I mean, Lakeview High just closed its

doors for good, right?

JIM

Right.

SUZY

So there's no reason for him to come

back because there won't be any of us

around...right?

JIM

Right. Except that Jason isn't real

so none of it matters anyway.

SUZY

Did you hear that?

JIM

Hear what?

SUZY

C'mon, I'm serious.

JIM

All right, I'll check it out.

SUZY

Jimmy...?

SUZY

Jim...?

SUZY

Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean

it...

JIM

Gotcha good, baby cakes.

JIM

All right, all right -- I'm a major

ass.

SUZY

And you'll never do it again.

JIM

And I'll never do it again. Forgive

me?

SUZY

No.

SUZY

JJJJJJJJason...

JIM

Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an

ass.

JIM

Ohmygod...

FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.

MCCULLOCH

Remember girls, the shuffleboard

tournament will start at six p.m.

sharp. A non-attendance will restrict

your time in port, understood?

MILES

You're telling me this boat has a pool

with a three meter board?

SEAN

It's a ship and that's right. Plus a

disco, gym, game room and a lot more.

MILES

I think I'm gonna blow off New York

and just stay on this thing.

MCCULLOCH

You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe...

MCCULLOCH

Your itinerary has been carefully

planned and make no mistake, it will

be executed accordingly.

MILES

(under his breath)

Of course...wouldn't want to risk

enjoying this trip.

SEAN

Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr.

McCulloch?

MCCULLOCH

Rennie's not coming.

SEAN

But I thought...

MCCULLOCH

She changed her mind.

(eyeing list)

Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom

one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are

in two-twenty-five.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)

Sean -- where the hell have you been?

We're already into early departure

protocol...

SEAN

Be right up, Dad.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I'm glad you decided to come after

all.

RENNIE

Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles

will be.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

You let me worry about him, okay?

(pause)

Personal experiences are what fuel the

minds of great writers, Rennie. You

made the right decision.

RENNIE

What about not-so-great writers?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Everything okay?

RENNIE

Just felt a little chill.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Did you know that I'm giving up

teaching?

RENNIE

Really?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Since the school is closing anyway,

I'm going to write that novel I've

been threatening on everybody.

RENNIE

That's wonderful, Miss Van

Deusen...what's it about?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

A senior class cruise to Manhattan,

laced with romance, adventure and

murder.

(beat)

Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't

decided which.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Go on, open it.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Stephen King supposedly used it when

he was in high school.

RENNIE

I don't know what to say...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Rennie, you're the best student I ever

had...you have a real gift. If anybody

can make use of that pen, it's you.

. TAMARA

Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock

'n roll or what, girl?

MRS. WATANABE

Hello, Tamara.

TAMARA

Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

MRS. WATANABE

Yes, I'm sure.

EVA

Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll

have a terrific time and I won't do

anything stupid, okay?

MRS. WATANABE

I love you...

TAMARA

I hear the crew members are cute guys

in their twenties.

EVA

Really?

TAMARA

I'm sure we'll have no problem getting

them to party with us...especially

with this.

TAMARA

It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It

cost over a thousand bucks but it's

the best.

EVA

He bought you that?

TAMARA

More or less. It's part of my college

fund.

MCCULLOCH

You can stop right there, Miss Mason.

MCCULL40CH

Only graduating seniors are allowed on

this cruise.

TAMARA

What are you talking about?

MCCULLOCB

You never turned in your final biology

project, so I've had your diploma

rescinded.

TAMARA

You can't do that...

MCCULLOCH

It's already been done.

(turning to Eva)

Congratulations on the 3.9 average,

Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-

fifty-five.

TAMARA

Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car

accident yesterday and missed our

appointment. It's okay, no big deal,

just a bruised arm...

(squeezes her arm)

...so I brought my project along

today. It's in my suitcase. Really.

EVA

She's telling the truth, Mr.

McCulloch. I saw her pack it.

MCCULLOCH

All right. But if it mysteriously

disappears en route, I'll have you

sent back home the minute we dock.

Understood?

TAMARA

Perfectly.

TAMARA

A major prick.

EVA

What are you going to do?

TAMARA

Improvise, of course.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked

in?

MCCULLOCH

Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never

showed up. I'm a little concerned.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Don't be. They probably decided to

explore each other rather than New

York.

MCCULLOCH

Let's go -- we're running two minutes

late.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Charles, there's someone else coming

along too.

MCCULLOCH

You have no right...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

And neither do you. It's up to Rennie

to decide what she wants to do.

MCCULLOCH

She doesn't know what she wants. She's

never had a stable life.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

And she sure doesn't have one now,

either. She needs to live.

MCCULLOCH

I'm her legal guardian, not you or

anybody else, and I alone know what's

best for her. End of discussion.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

No, I think it's just the beginning.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hhhhelp me...

YOUNG JASON

Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

What's wrong, Rennie??

RENNIE

I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

(checking watch)

Let's take in the brow.

CHIEF ENGINEER

Yes Sir.

(into intercom phone.)

Take in the gangway and single up all

lines.

SEAN

Hello, Dad.

MILES

Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your

ship.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've

retired from the Navy ten years ago.

MILES

You've really been generous to give us

this cruise. I know I speak for

everybody on board.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Hell, there's just twenty or so of you

-- we only need a skeleton crew and

it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.

(beat)

By the way, congratulations on winning

the intramural diving championships,

Miles. I'm sure you made your old man

proud.

CHIEF ENGINEER

Have you decided on your departure

protocol, Admiral?

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Actually, I thought I'd leave the

honors to my son.

SEAN

Dad, I don't think...

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

(to Chief Engineer, ignoring

Sean)

Relinquishing command of the Princess

Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

But before you take the helm, take

this.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Something old and something new. I

used the sextant when I was your age,

but now they have these goddamn

computers to do all the work for you.

CHIEF ENGINEER

(to Sean)

Have you decided on a plan of

departure, Captain?

SEAN

How about if we start up the forward

engines and come around. 180

degrees...

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Aren't you forgetting something?

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

We're in foggy weather! Send out the

international maritime signal that a

vessel is backing down, followed by a

security broadcast warning other

ships!

DECK HAND

This voyage is doomed.

SEAN

Yeah, tell me about it.

SEAN

Rennie...

RENNIE

Hi, Sean.

SEAN

I heard you weren't coming.

RENNIE

(glances at Toby)

We changed our minds.

SEAN

I got you a present.

RENNIE

But I didn't get you one...

SEAN

Forget it. It's a dumb little thing

anyway.

RENNIE

Sean...it's beautiful.

SEAN

I thought maybe we could hike to the

top of the Statue when we got there,

if you felt like it. It's supposed to

be 22 stories tall.

RENNIE

I'd love to.

MCCULLOCH (O.S.)

Your father was looking for you, Mr.

Robertson.

SEAN

I guess I'll see you later.

MCCULLOCH

There's a storm predicted tonight.

MCCULLOCH

You're making a big mistake, Rennie.

It's not too late to put you back on

land.

RENNIE

I'm staying.

MCCULLOCH

If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you

were of...

RENNIE

She didn't push me into coming.

MCCULLOCH

Why are you doing this to yourself?

RENNIE

I don't even know why I'm afraid,

Uncle Charles. I can't even remember

when it started. Don't you think it's

time I found out and got over it?

MCCULLOCH

Facing your fear doesn't always

conquer it.

RENNIE

I'm staying.

J.J.

(into camera)

Is this axe awesome or what?

WAYNE

Too cool, J.J. Your parents came

through.

J.J.

No lie. I hear there's a big power

room down below where I can get

supreme concert hall echo. Come down

and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

WAYNE

Sure...but I gotta shoot some

shockumentary footage first.

J.J.

Man, don't tell me you're still trying

to scam on Tamara...

J.J.

How long have we known each other?

Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not

interested in you, only what you can

do for her. She's a user.

WAYNE

She's sexy.

J.J.

So's this guitar. So what?

WAYNE

I'll catch you later.

J.J.

This place is aching for a video.

Wayne, you're an asshole.

RENNIE

What do you think...time for some

personal experiences to fuel our

minds?

RENNIE

I agree.

RENNIE

Okay Toby, calm down...

EVA

I'm not sure we're supposed to be

here, Tamara.

TAMARA

Is that a muscular bod or what?

TAMARA

He's undefeated, you know that?

(beat)

Julius is the only senior I'd even

consider doing it with. If he wasn't

black, that is.

EVA

(awkward)

My parents are open minded about that

sort of thing.

TAMARA

My stepmom couldn't care less, but

Daddy would have a shit fit.

(lets it slip out)

He might even pay some attention to

me.

TAMARA

Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look

sensual.

TAMARA

I think it's time for some

recreational activity, girl.

EVA

Sounds good. I hear there's a

shuffleboard court on deck -- it might

be kinds cool...

TAMARA

You're joking, right?

MCCULLOCH

Have you seen my niece anywhere?

WAYNE

Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think.

What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

MCCULLOCH

Senior predictions started five

minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.

WAYNE

Some of us don't want our futures

predicted.

MCCULLOCH

In your case I'm sure that's true.

TAMARA

The night time is the right time.

EVA

(nervous)

No thanks.

TAMARA

What? Don't be a lightweight...this is

top dollar toot.

EVA

It's not that, it's just that...

(beat)

It I get caught, I'll lose my science

scholarship and everything.

TAMARA

You're talking to the prom queen,

Eva. Do you really think I'm going to

risk getting caught?

EVA

(a pause)

I guess not.

TAMARA

Do you realize how many people would

kill to be sitting here right now?

Come on, it's grad night. You've got

your whole life to be uptight.

TAMARA

Is that unbelievable or what?

TAMARA

Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.

RENNIE

Have you seen my dog? I think he came

this way.

TAMARA

No, we haven't.

(awkwardly)

Care for a hit?

RENNIE

No thanks.

TAMARA

A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll

narc on us...

EVA

I have her in Creative Writing and

she's fairly nice.

TAMARA

Nobody related to McCulloch can be

nice.

RENNIE

Toby?

TAMARA

Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.

MCCULLOCH

What are you doing in here?

TAMARA

Nothing.

MCCULLOCH

Are you girls using drugs?

EVA

Do you think I would use drugs, Mr.

McCulloch? We were just exploring the

ship.

MCCULLOCH

I'11 be coming around your stateroom

in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss

Mason. You'd better have your biology

project ready or I'm phoning your

parents.

TAMARA

They're out of town.

MCCULLOCH

Then I'll make sure you remain on

board while your classmates see the

sights.

EVA

What are you going to do?

TAMARA

Relax, I've got McCulloch covered...

but that little narcing bitch niece of

his is a different matter.

(calculating)

Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid

of the water...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Poetry in motion, Miles.

MILES

A half-twist short. I'll hone that

dive yet.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Rennie -- I was just on my way over to

your room

RENNIE

Have you seen my dog anywhere?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The

ship's only so big and there's

certainly no way off it, is there?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

So, are you having fun yet?

RENNIE

(lying)

Yeah...a lot.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I seem to detect a hint of

ingenuousness in your tone.

(beat)

In other words, level with me.

RENNIE

(a pause)

There's something I haven't told

you...

TAMARA

Wow, sorry...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Why on earth would you do something

like that?

TAMARA

It was an accident, I swear...

SEAN

What happened?

(to Rennie)

Rennie, are you okay?

TAMARA

That was truly excellent.

EVA

(feels like shit)

Yeah.

TAMARA

Time to check out the waiters.

EVA

I think I'll pass. See you later,

okay?

TAMARA

But...wait a minute!

TAMARA

Some friend you are.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(to Sean)

Bring her a towel, okay?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

She's fine -- everybody go back to

what you were doing.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Care to talk about it?

RENNIE

I can't swim.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I gathered that.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I had a skiing accident in high

school, broke my left leg. It took

three winters before I would even look

at the snow again...but the solution

kept eluding me.

(beat)

I finally took lessons. I've never

broken a bone since.

RENNIE

It's not that simple.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Maybe not. But you're not telling me

everything, are you?

RENNIE

(long pause)

Whenever I get near the water, I see

this young boy drowning. He tries to

pull me down with him.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

When did this start?

RENNIE

About four years ago...at Crystal

Lake. I spent a few summers there with

Uncle Charles inbetween boarding

school.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

After your parents passed away?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Did you have an accident in the lake?

RENNIE

No. It was just a normal summer. I've

never been able to figure it out.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Only one young boy ever drowned in

that lake, and that was before you

were even born. His name was Jason

Voorhees.

MCCULLOCH (O.S.)

Dear God...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

MCCULLOCH

Oh, I can see that. You've done a

wonderful job of supervising the kids,

Miss Van Deusen.

RENNIE

It wasn't her fault.

MCCULLOCH

Stay away from her...both of you.

DECK HAND

He's come back and you're all going to

die.

RENNIE

Just...leave me alone...

TAMARA (O.S.)

The door's open.

MCCULLOCH

I'm in no mood for any more stall

tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your

final project?

TAMARA

Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne

first, Charles?

MCCULLOCH

Where did you get that alcohol?

TAMARA

I packed it. Just for us.

MCCULLOCH

That's it. You're not setting foot off

this ship until we return home.

TAMARA

But I haven't even shown you my

biology project...

TAMARA

Take a closer look, Charles. I want to

make sure I labeled all my organs

correctly.

MCCULLOCH

Oh, you've done it now. Not only are

you going home, I'll see to it that

you spend next year back in a high

school classroom!

TAMARA

I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.

(to Wayne)

Did you get anything good?

WAYNE

Oh yeah.

MCCULLOCH

You'll never get away with it.

(eyeing Wayne)

And you can forget about ever

attending any film school.

(serious beat)

You're both going to be very, very

sorry.

TAMARA

Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a

thing.

(beat)

Can I have the tape?

WAYNE

This is going to sound supremely

lame...but I've had the major hots for

you since our sophomore year, Tamara.

TAMARA

That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to

chat but I'm really pressed for time.

(ushering him to door)

Let's try to get together later, okey-

doke?

WAYNE

But I thought...

TAMARA

Thanks for the camerawork.

WAYNE

Wayne, you're an asshole.

RENNIE

It's not real, it's not real...

TAMARA

Please...please don't...

SEAN

It's okay...you're going to be okay.

RENNIE

I want to go home. I want off this

ship.

SEAN

Me too.

(beat)

Let's go talk to my Dad.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr.

Carlson, and get the seas off the

quarter. These kids are in for one

hell of a storm.

CHIEF ENGINEER

Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise

mode.

ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON

How olds your boy now, Carlson?

CHIEF ENGINEER

Nineteen months.

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

A tremendous age. Take some advice

from a salty old man: don't push him

too hard.

CHIEF ENGINEER

This is the bridge. Approaching

weather suggests we secure the main

deck and...

ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

Better have them doublecheck the

lifeboat stations as well...

RENNIE

Can he really take us home?

SEAN

Not completing a voyage is against

everything he stands for. But I think

I can convince him to call a Coast

Guard cutter for you.

RENNIE

What about you?

SEAN

If I go with you, he'll never

speak to me again.

(beat)

But I'm never going to live up to his

expectations anyway...so maybe it's

the right thing to do.

SEAN

Oh Jesus...Dad??

SEAN

He's...he's dead...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Ronnie? I just came by to see how you

were feeling...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Rennie...?

MCCULLOCH

I thought I told you to stay away from

her.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(holds her ground)

Where is she?

MCCULLOCB

(accusing)

That's a very good question and I'd

appreciate an answer.

SEAN (V.O.)

Attention everybody, attention. This

is Sean Robertson...

SEAN (V.O.)

There's been...

(swallows)

What I mean is, this is an

emergency...

WAYNE

Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was

supposed to be jamming down in the

power room but...

SEAN (V.O.)

Repeat, this is an emergency...

SEAN (V.O.)

I want everybody to meet on the

bridge...

JULIUS

What the fuck is this?

SEAN (V.O.)

Stay calm, but get here as quick as

possible. Walk with a friend if you

can...

SEAN (V.O.)

God, I wish this was a joke, but it's

not.

RENNIE

What is happening???

SEAN

I don't know...we've gone off course

or something...

RENNIE

What do you mean???

SEAN

I don't know what I mean! All's I know

is that there's no one guiding this

ship anymore...

RENNIE

Can't you call for help??

SEAN

I think so. But we have to lower the

anchors so we don't drift any

further...

RENNIE

Where are they?

SEAN

The bow...front of the ship. There's a

hoist on each side that lowers them

SEAN

I didn't mean for you to go!

RENNIE

Just radio for help, okay???

SEAN

Mayday, mayday, mayday...

SEAN

Please...can anybody out there hear

me??

MILES

Sean, what's going on?

WAYNE

Jesus Christ...

JULIUS

Who did this, man?

WAYNE

Is the radio even working??

MILES

Isn't there some international S.O.S.

thing you can do???

SEAN

(suddenly remembers)

Channel 16...the distress frequency...

(dialing knob)

Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the

Princess Ruby. Please, somebody

answer...

RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)

This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas.

What is the nature of your problem,

Ruby?

SEAN

The Captain and Chief Engineer...

they've been...they're dead.

RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)

(a grave-pause)

What is your location?

SEAN

I...I don't know...

RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)

Is your ship equipped with Omega

satellite navigation or LORAN?

SEAN

Yes...

RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)

The LORAN has a digital printout of

your latitude and longitude. Give me

the coordinates and we'll be there as

quick as we can.

SEAN

I've got the numbers.

RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)

Give me the degrees first, followed by

minutes and sec...

SEAN

Hello? Are you there??

MCCULLOCH

I demand to know what is going on...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Oh dear God...

MCCULLOCH

Where's the radio?

SEAN

It's...dead.

DECK HAND (O.S.)

You're all going to die.

DECK HAND

You're the last ones. He's come back

for you.

MCCULLOCH

What are you talking about?

DECK HAND

Jason Voorhees.

MCCULLOCH

You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees

has been dead for over thirty years.

DECK HAND

He walks this ship, here and now.

MCCULLOCH

A killer walks this ship indeed. And

it's certainly none of us...

DECK HAND

You're the one who's insane!!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

What are you doing??

MCCULLOCH

That lunatic has been spouting off

about Jason since we boarded...

(eyeing bodies)

It's no coincidence.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

But that doesn't prove that he's the

one!

MCCULLOCH

Walking corpses are not real!

JULIUS

Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure

enough real.

(to the others)

I say we regroup and find this

motherfucker before he finds us.

MCCULLOCH

You'll do no.such thing and watch your

mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!

JULIUS

School's out, McCulloch.

(to the others)

Let's go.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Please everybody, stay here!!

MCCULLOCH

Christ...where's Rennie??

SEAN

She's...she's dropping the anchors. I

thought the Coast Guard could find us

easier if...

MCCULLOCH

What?? You sent her out there with a

murderer running around loose??

EVA

What's going on? I heard on the P.A.

system that...

WAYNE

(interrupting)

The Captain's been murdered. The buzz

is that Jason might be on board.

EVA

Jason...Voorhees?

EVA

Have you seen Tamara?

WAYNE

No. And I'm not losing any sleep over

it.

EVA

But she might be in trouble...

WAYNE

So what else is new?

(beat)

Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude

to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise

up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

EVA

I don't care about being hip anymore.

WAYNE

I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

RENNIE

Toby?

EVA (O.S.)

Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?

EVA

Tamara?

EVA

Tamara?

(no response)

I just want to talk with you.

RENNIE

Toby? Where'd you go?

MCCULLOCH

You had me worried to death!

RENNIE

But Sean said...

MCCULLOCH

I'm the one you should be listening

to! Do you think dropping an anchor in

the middle of a storm makes any sense

whatsoever?

JULIUS

I managed to scrounge this shit from

the game room and hallways. Grab what

you want.

WAYNE

What are you taking, Julius?

JULIUS

(flexes fists)

Nothin'.

WAYNE

(dead serious)

We're talking the possibility of Jason

Voorhees here.

JULIUS

Nothin' but this gun.

RENNIE

Can't we at least talk about it?

MCCULLOCH

I refuse to discuss this ridiculous

notion that a ghoul is terrorizing

this ship.

RENNIE

But what about the drowning boy I've

been seeing?

MCCULLOCH

Whatever you've been...imagining...

has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.

(pause)

I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's

all I care about.

RENNIE

I'm not staying in my room, Uncle

Charles.

MCCULLOCH

This isn't a request.

RENNIE (O.S.)

Uncle Charles!

WAYNE

J.J. -- you down here?

WAYNE

We got a major problem, Wayne.

WAYNE

No...

WAYNE

No no no...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

What was that??

SEAN

(very worried)

I don't know.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(trying not to panic)

What happens if we don't get control

of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell

me the truth.

SEAN

(beat)

We could hit a reef, collide with

another ship...we could be out here

for weeks before anybody spotted us.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Did you find Rennie?

MCCULLOCH

She's locked safe in her room, no

thanks to either of you.

(like Sean isn't even in the

room)

Has he brought it back on course yet?

MISS VAN DEUSEN

He's doing the best he can, Charles.

MCCULLOCH

He's the son of the Captain, for

Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able

to operate this thing!

MCCULLOCH

Well?

SEAN

It worked...we're back on course!

MCCULLOCH

What's that?

SEAN

The fire alarm...

MCCULLOCH

Can you shut that damn thing off??

MISS VAN DEUSEN

We already thought of that -- nobody

could possibly see it in this storm...

MCCULIACH

There's only one person who needs to

see it. And I'm going to find him.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

What about the fire??

MCCULLOCH

I doubt very much that one even

exists.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

What are you talking about?

MCCULLOCH

Use some common sense! Setting off a

fire alarm causes panic...the same

kind of panic caused by suggesting

Jason Voorhees is on board.

(resolved)

Enough is enough.

SEAN

We have to get everybody together just

in case the fire's for real.

MILES

I'll take the upper deck.

JULIUS

Miles??

YOUNG JASON (O.S.)

Hhhhelp....me....

YOUNG JASON

Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

YOUNG RENNIE

Hhhhelp....me....

SEAN

Rennie...??

RENNIE

(pointing)

The window...

RENNIE

I don't understand what is happening

to me...

SEAN

It's gonna be okay...

RENNIE

What is it??

SEAN

The power room...

SEAN

Rule one, don't panic. Rule two,

assess the damage and act

accordingly...

RENNIE

Is the ship going to sink??

SEAN

I don't know.

SEAN

The emergency lights just kicked in...

SEAN

We'll be okay. I want you to wait by

the lifeboats, just in case.

RENNIE

(terrified)

I'm not going near any lifeboat!

SEAN

But Rennie...

RENNIE

I'm not!!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Everybody wait right here until I come

back with the others -- understand?

MCCULLOCH

Rennie??

MCCULLOCH

Come on, answer!!

SEAN

Water has gotten to the engines.

(coughs)

We have to get everybody off this

ship...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(shouting over storm)

Everybody climb in!

MCCULLOCH

What did you do with Rennie??

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Everybody hurry...please...

MCCULLOCH

She never should've set foot on this

ship. This is your fault!

SEAN

This is Jason's fault!

MCCULLOCH

(shouting)

Not another word, do you hear me??

MCCULLOCH

Why aren't you with the others,

woman??

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Jason...he has an axe...

MCCULLOCH

Jason Voorhees is dead!!

MCCULLOCH

Dear Christ...

SEAN

We have to get off this ship!!

SEAN

Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Come on, sweetheart -- get in...

MCCULLOCH

Get in the boat, Rennie!

RENNIE

I...I can't...

MCCULLOCH

(shaking her)

You can and you will!!

SEAN

Stop it!!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Leave her alone, Charles!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get

in the boat now, okay? Please...for

me?

RENNIE

Toby...

SEAN

Come on...faster....

SEAN

Start rowing!!

SEAN

He's gone...

SEAN

It's Julius!

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

MCCULLOCH

(miserable)

If we don't find the shore soon we're

all going to die.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(unable to hide fear)

Do you know where we are, Sean?

JULIUS

Hey man, if I can make it, so can.

you.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

JULIUS

Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!

JULIUS

God damn, we're in New York! You did

it, my man!!

YOUNG RENNIE

Hhhhelp...me....

RENNIE

No!!!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(holding her)

It's okay...you're safe now...

MCCULLOCH

Come on -- everybody up the ladder.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

There must be a phone around here

somewhere.

MCCULLOCH

A wonderful choice of places to dock a

boat, Mr. Robertson.

GANG RANGER #1

Hands up!!

GANG BANGER #2

Do it!!

GANG BANGER #2

Got some good shit here, holmes.

GANG BANGER #1

(eyeing Rennie)

You got that right...

GANG BANGER #L

Now ain't that sweet.

GANG BANGER #1

Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.

GANG BANGER #L

You got a problem, Dad?

RENNIE

No!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Please, don't hurt her...

GANG BANGER #L

Hurt this princess?

(beat)

Would I do that?

GANG BANGER #1

You look like a party girl, princess.

How'd you like to go on a date with me

and my friend? If you're free, that

is.

GANG BANGER #2

You follow and we'll blow her fuckin'

head off, comprende?

JULIUS

We can't let those gang-bangers get

away, man...

MCCULLOCH

You heard him! We have to call the

police

MCCULLOCH

Everyone split up -- we'll cover more

ground that way.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I don't think that's such a safe idea

MCCULLOCH

My niece's life hangs in the balance

right now!! Every second counts.

GANG BANGER #L

Welcome to the casbah, princess.

RENNIE

Please don't...

GANG BANGER #1

Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way

better if you're stoned.

GANG BANGER #1

Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're

in for a long night.

GANG BANGER #1

It's your parade, princess. Can be

smooth or can be rough. Your choice.

GANG BANGER #1

I think I'm in love.

GANG BANGER #2

Forgot my money, holmes...

GANG BANGER #2

Who the fuck are you?

GANG BANGER #2

You're dead, fuckhead.

JULIUS

C'mon...

JULIUS

Get me the police -- this is an

emergency...

JULIUS

Use the combos and keep the feet

light...

JULIUS

Take your best shot, motherfucker...

SEAN

Rennie...what'd they do to you??

RENNIE

Drugs...

(serious pause)

Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

SEAN

We have to find the others.

VOICE

Freeze.

MCCULLOCH

It's okay -- she's with me.

IRISH COP

My apologies, Miss. My unit's right

over here.

SEAN (O.S.)

Hey!

MCCULLOCH

Rennie, thank God...

SEAN

Jason's here in New York.

MCCULLOCH

Don't be ridiculous!

MISS VAN DEUSEN

Is it true, Rennie??

IRISH COP

Is this the lass in question?

MCCULLOCH

(stewing)

Yes.

IRISH COP

Who is...Jason?

MCCULLOCH

He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from

hell.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

I'm afraid you'll have some trouble

believing us.

IRISH COP

So try me.

IRISH COP

You're right -- I find it a tall tale

indeed.

But you seem like honest folks so I'm

inclined to believe at least some of

it.

MISS VAN DEUSEN

(relieved)

Thank you. The first thing we' have to

do is find Julius.

IRISH COP

I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why

don't you climb in the back while I

radio for backup.

SEAN

There aren't any handles!!

MCCULLOCH

Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!

SEAN

Miss Van Deusen...

YOUNG RENNIE

What a beautiful day.

MCCULLOCH

Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

MCCULLOCH

You've been coming out here every

summer for the last three years, young

lady, and you still haven't learned

how.

YOUNG RENNIE

I'll take some lessons this time. I

promise.

MCCULLOCH

That's what you said last year. I

think the time for your first swimming

lesson has just come.

MCCULLOCH

You don't want to end up drowning like

that Voorhees boy, do you?

MCCULLOCH

He never learned how either and he's

still at the bottom of this lake.

YOUNG RENNIE

He is not.

MCCULLOCH

Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull

down anybody who falls in and can't

swim.

YOUNG RENNIE

You're telling a lie.

MCCULLOCH

Am I? Let's find out.

MCCULLOCH

Better swim before Jason drags you

down, Rennie. Come on, you can do

it...

YOUNG RENNIE

I...I can't...

MCCULLOCH

You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

YOUNG RENNIE

Hhhhelp...me....

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

RENNIE

You pushed me...

MCCULLOCH

(defensively)

I was only trying to teach you. But I

pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your

life.

SEAN

You son of a bitch...

RENNIE

He was down there!!!

SEAN

You keep away from her!

MCCULLOCH

You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

RENNIE

I was at school when they told me.

'Rennie, we have some very bad news...

your parents have been killed in an

auto accident.'

RENNIE

It seems like everybody I care about

ends up...

SEAN

Not this time.

RENNIE

Toby...

RENNIE

What's wrong, boy?

TICKET TAKER

Hey!

SEAN

Come on...

TRAIN ENGINEER

Hey pal, you can't do that...

RENNIE

NO!!!

SEAN

It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

SEAN

God...please no...

RENNIE

Somebody help us!! He's going to kill

us!!!

STREET URCHIN

You're dead meat, slime bag.

STREET URCHIN

Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

SEAN

(out of breath)

You have to call the police...

RENNIE

Please, hurry...

WAITRESS

There's a pay phone in back.

WAITRESS

...but it's broken.

RENNIE

You don't understand -- there's a

maniac trying to kill us!!!

WAITRESS

(blase)

Welcome to New York.

RENNIE

Look!

SANITATION ENGINEER

What the hell are you kids doing down

here?

SEAN

Can you help us get out??

SANITATION ENGINEER

I sure can and we don't have a minute

to waste.

SEAN

What do you mean?

SANITATION ENGINEER

Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods

out with the stuff on the 13th of

every month, right at midnight.

(checks watch)

And that's less than ten minutes from

now.

SANITATION ENGINEER

Follow me.

SEAN

Run, Rennie...

RENNIE

You never got me in the lake, Jason.

And you're not going to get me now

either.

RENNIE

Get up, Sean!!!

RENNIE

(screaming)

Climb!!!

JASON

Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN,

MOMMY...

YOUNG JASON

Hhhhelp me....

SEAN

I hear there's a statue here that's 22

stories tall.

RENNIE

Oh Toby...

FADE OUT.

THE END
