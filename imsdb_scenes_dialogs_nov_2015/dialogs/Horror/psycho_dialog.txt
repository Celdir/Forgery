"PSYCHO"

"PSYCHO"

By

Joseph Stefano

Based on the novel by Robert Bloch

REVISED December 1, 1959

CUT TO:

SAM

Never did eat your lunch, did you.

MARY

I better get back to the office.

These extended lunch hours give my

boss excess acid.

SAM

Call your boss and tell him you're

taking the rest of the afternoon

off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

MARY

(soft sarcasm)

What do I do with my free afternoon,

walk you to the airport?

SAM

(meaningfully)

We could laze around here a while

longer.

MARY

Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels

of this sort aren't interested in

you when you come in, but when your

time's up...

(a small anguish)

Sam, I hate having to be with you in

a place like this.

SAM

I've heard of married couples who

deliberately spend occasional nights

in cheap hotels. They say it...

MARY

(interrupting)

When you're married you can do a lot

of things deliberately.

SAM

You sure talk like a girl who's been

married.

MARY

Sam!

SAM

I'm sorry, Mary.

(after a moment)

My old Dad used to say 'when you

can't change a situation, laugh at

it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like

laughing at it.

MARY

I've lost my girlish laughter.

SAM

(observing)

The only girlish thing you have lost.

MARY

(a meaningful quiet,

then, with difficulty:)

Sam. This is the last time.

SAM

For what?

MARY

This! Meeting you in secret so we

can be... secretive! You come down

here on business trips and we steal

lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't

even come.

SAM

Okay. What do we do instead, write

each other lurid love letters?

MARY

(about to argue, then

turning away)

I haven't time to argue. I'm a working

girl.

SAM

And I'm a working man! We're a regular

working-class tragedy!

(he laughs)

MARY

It is tragic! Or it will be... if we

go on meeting in shabby hotels

whenever you can find a tax-deductible

excuse for flying down deductible

here...

SAM

(interrupting,

seriously)

You can't laugh at it, huh?

MARY

Can you?

SAM

Sure. It's like laughing through a

broken jaw, but...

SAM

And besides, when you say I make tax-

deductible excuses you make me out a

criminal.

MARY

(having to smile)

You couldn't be a criminal if you

committed a major crime.

SAM

I wish I were. Not an active criminal

but... a nice guy with the conscience

of a criminal.

(goes close to mary,

touches her)

Next best thing to no conscience at

all.

MARY

(pulling away)

I have to go, Sam.

SAM

I can come down next week.

MARY

No.

SAM

Not even just to see you, to have

lunch... in public?

MARY

We can see each other, we can even

have dinner... but respectably, in

my house with my mother's picture on

the mantel and my sister helping me

broil a big steak for three!

SAM

And after the steak... do we send

Sister to the movies and turn Mama's

picture to the wall?

MARY

Sam! No!

SAM

(after a pause, simply)

All right.

SAM

Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-

deductible or not, I want to see

deductible you. And under any

conditions.

(a smile)

Even respectability.

MARY

You make respectability sound...

disrespectful.

SAM

(brightly)

I'm all for it! It requires patience

and temperance and a lot of sweating-

out... otherwise, though, it's only

hard work.

(a pause)

But if I can see you, touch you even

as simply as this... I won't mind.

SAM

I'm fed up with sweating for people

who aren't there. I sweat to pay off

my father's debts... and he's in his

grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife

alimony, and she's living on the

other side of the world somewhere.

MARY

(a smile)

I pay, too. They also pay who meet

in hotel rooms.

SAM

A couple of years and the debts will

be paid off. And if she ever re-

marries, the alimony stops... and

then...

MARY

I haven't even been married once

yet!

SAM

Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.

MARY

(smiling, then with a

terrible urgency)

Sam, let's go get married.

SAM

And live with me in a storeroom behind

a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll

have a lot of laughs. When I send my

ex-wife her money, you can lick the

stamps.

MARY

(a deep desperation)

I'll lick the stamps.

SAM

You know what I'd like? A clear,

empty sky... and a plane, and us in

it... and somewhere a private island

for sale, where we can run around

without our... shoes on.  And the

wherewithal to buy what I'd like.

(he moves away,

suddenly serious)

Mary, you want to cut this off, go

out and find yourself someone

available.

MARY

I'm thinking of it.

SAM

(a cheerful shout)

How can you even think a thing like

that!

MARY

(picking up handbag,

starting for door)

Don't miss your plane.

SAM

Hey, we can leave together can't we?

MARY

(at door)

I'm late... and you have to put your

shoes on.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MARY

Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

CAROLINE

(a high, bright, eager-

to-talk voice laced

to-with a vague Texan

accent)

He's lunching with the man who's

buying the Harris Street property,

you know, that oil lease man...  so

that's why he's late.

(a pause, then, as

Mary does not respond

to the pointed thrust)

You getting a headache?

MARY

It'll pass. Headaches are like

resolutions... you forget them soon

as they stop hurting.

CAROLINE

You got aspirins? I have something...

not aspirins, but

(cheerfully takes

bottle of pills out

of desk drawer)

my mother's doctor gave these to me

the day of my wedding.

(laughs)

Teddy was furious when he found out

I'd taken tranquilizers!

MARY

Were there any calls?

CAROLINE

Teddy called.  Me... And my mother

called to see if Teddy called. Oh,

and your sister called to say she's

going to Tucson to do some buying

and she'll be gone the whole weekend

and...

CASSIDY

Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls

should get your boss to air-condition

you up. He can afford it today.

LOWERY

Mary, will you get those copies of

the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.

CASSIDY

Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little

girl...

(laughs as Mary looks

up at him)

Not you, my daughter!  A baby, and

tomorrow she stands up there and

gets her sweet self married away

from me!

(pulling out wallet)

I want you to look at my baby.

Eighteen years old... and she's never

had an unhappy day in any one of

those years!

(flashes photo)

LOWERY

Come on, Tom, my office is air-

conditioned.

CASSIDY

(ignoring Lowery)

You know what I do with unhappiness?

I buy it off! You unhappy?

MARY

Not inordinately.

(puts deed copy into

Cassidy's too-close

hand)

CASSIDY

I'm buying this house for my baby's

wedding present. Forty thousand

dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying

happiness, that's buying off

unhappiness! That penniless punk

she's marryin'...

(laughs)

Probably a good kid... it's just

that I hate him.

(looks at deed)

Yup! Forty thousand, says here...

(to Lowery)

Casharoonie!

CASSIDY

I never carry more than I can afford

to lose!

(closer to Mary)

Count 'em!

LOWERY

(shocked, worried)

Tom... cash transactions of this

size! Most irregular...

CASSIDY

So what? It's my private money!

(laughs, winks, elbows

Lowery)

And now it's yours.

CAROLINE

(staring at the money)

I declare!

CASSIDY

(whispering)

I don't! That's how I'm able to keep

it!

(laughs)

LOWERY

(hastily interrupting)

Suppose we just put this in the safe

and then Monday morning when you're

feeling good...

CASSIDY

Speakin' of feeling good, where's

that bottle you said you had in your

desk...

(laughs, as if having

given away Lowery's

secret)

Oops!

(to Mary, patting her

arm)

Usually I can keep my mouth shut!

CASSIDY

Honest. I can keep any private

transaction a secret... any pri....

(stopped by Mary's

cold gaze)

Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!

LOWERY

(quietly)

I don't even want it in the office

over the weekend. Put it in the safe

deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And

we'll get him to give us a check on

Monday - instead.

CAROLINE

He was flirting with you. I guess he

noticed my wedding ring.

LOWERY (O.S.)

Come in.

MARY

The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't

mind, I'd like to go right on home

after the bank. I have a slight...

CASSIDY

You go right home!  Me and your boss

are going out to get ourselves a

little drinkin' done!

(to Lowery)

Right?

LOWERY

(to Mary)

Of course. You feeling ill?

MARY

A headache.

CASSIDY

You need a week-end in Las Vegas...

playground of the world!

MARY

I'm going to spend this week-end in

bed.

(starts out)

CASSIDY

(to Lowery)

Only playground that beats Las Vegas!

CAROLINE

Aren't you going to take the pills?

(as Mary shakes her

head)

They'll knock that headache out.

MARY

I don't need pills... just sleep.

DISSOLVE TO:

LONG LAP DISSOLVE:

PATROLMAN

(startled)

Hold it there!

PATROLMAN

In quite a hurry.

MARY

Yes.

(because he seems to

be awaiting an

explanation)

I didn't mean to sleep so long. I

was afraid I'd have an accident last

night, from sleepiness... so I decided

to pull over...

PATROLMAN

You slept here all night?

MARY

(a faint edge of

defensiveness)

Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my

eyes...

PATROLMAN

(mere concern)

There are plenty of motels in this

area. You should have... I mean,

just to be safe...

MARY

I didn't intend to sleep all night!

I just pulled over... have I broken

any laws?

PATROLMAN

No, m'am.

MARY

Then I'm free to go...?

PATROLMAN

(a pause)

Is anything wrong?

MARY

Of course not! Am I acting as if...

something's wrong?

PATROLMAN

(almost a smile)

Frankly, yes.

MARY

Please... I'd like to go...

PATROLMAN

Is there?

MARY

Is there what?

(not waiting for an

answer)

I've told you there's nothing wrong...

except that I'm in a hurry and you're

taking up my time...

PATROLMAN

(interrupting, sternly)

Now wait just a moment! Turn your

motor off, please.

PATROLMAN

In the course of my duty, I never

"take up" anyone's time, whether

it's to give a warning, or a ticket,

or help! Believe that, M'am.

(a little softer)

Now if you woke up on the wrong side

of... the car seat, that's one thing.

But when you act as if I've just

placed you under arrest...

MARY

I'm sorry.

PATROLMAN

No need to apologize...

PATROLMAN

Wait a minute!

MARY

(jamming down the

brake)

Now what?

PATROLMAN

May I see your license?

MARY

Why?

PATROLMAN

Please.

DISSOLVE:

CAR DEALER

With you in a second!

CAR DEALER

I'm in no mood for trouble!

MARY

(glancing up, thrown

for a moment)

What?

CAR DEALER

(cheerfully)

There's an old saying, "First customer

of the day is always the most

trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no

mood for it so I'm just going to

treat you so fair and square you

won't have one human reason to give

me...

MARY

(interrupting)

Can I trade in my car and take

another?

CAR DEALER

You can do anything you've a mind

to... and bein' a woman, you will!

(chin-indicating her

car)

That yours?

MARY

Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it,

I'm just...

CAR DEALER

Sick of the sight of it!

(laughs)

Well, suppose you look around for

something that strikes your eyes and

meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give

yours the once over and... want some

coffee? I was just about...

MARY

No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I

just want to make a change and

start...

CAR DEALER

One thing people never ought to be

when they're buying a used car is in

a hurry!

(starting away toward

her car)

But like I said, too nice a day for

arguing. I'll just shoot this into

the garage.

CAR DEALER

That's the one I'd've picked for you

myself!

MARY

How much?

CAR DEALER

Go ahead! Spin it around the block.

Now I know you don't know anything

about engine condition, but you can

feel, can't you... and it's all in

the feel, believe me, you feel that

one around the block...

MARY

It looks fine. How much will it be,

with my car...?

CAR DEALER

You mean you don't want the usual

day and a half to think it over?

(laughs)

You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin'

you?

MARY

Of course not. Please.

CAR DEALER

Well... heck, this is the first time

I ever saw the customer high-pressure

the salesman!

(laughs, sees she is

in no mood for it)

I'd figure roughly...

(looks at the car,

then back at the

garage)

...your car plus five hundred.

MARY

Five hundred.

CAR DEALER

Aha! Always got time to argue money,

huh...?

MARY

All right.

CAR DEALER

(slowly)

I take it... you can prove that car's

yours... I mean, out of state and

all... got your pink slip and your...

MARY

I think I have the necessary papers.

Is there a Ladies Room...

CAR DEALER

In the building ...

(indicates, continues

to stare quietly)

Mary starts for the building, glancing

once in the direction of the

Patrolman.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CAR DEALER

(too cheerfully)

I think you'd better give it a trial

spin. Don't want any bad word of

mouth about California Charlie.

MARY

I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't

we just settle this and...

CAR DEALER

I'll be perfectly honest with you,

Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust

you, but...

MARY

(interrupting)

But what?  Is there anything so

terribly wrong about... making a

decision and wanting to hurry? Do

you think I've stolen... my car?

CAR DEALER

No, M'am. I was only about to say,

I've sent my mechanic out to give

your car a little test... that's

all.

MARY

(handing him the

ownership papers and

the new bills)

I'd like to be ready when he gets

back.

CAR DEALER

Okay. If you'll come along...

MECHANIC

Hey! Miss?

MARY

(as Mechanic reaches

car)

Just put it right in here, please...

beside me.

DISSOLVE TO:

CAR DEALER'S VOICE

Heck, Officer, that was the first

time I ever saw the Customer high-

pressure the Salesman!  Somebody

chasing her?

PATROLMAN'S VOICE

I better have a look at those papers,

Charlie.

CAR DEALER'S VOICE

She look like a wrong-one to you?

PATROLMAN'S VOICE

Acted like one.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CAROLINE'S VOICE

Yes, Mr. Lowery.

LOWERY'S VOICE

(a worried tone)

Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?

CAROLINE'S VOICE

No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's

always a bit late on Monday mornings.

LOWERY'S VOICE

Buzz me the minute she comes in.

LOWERY'S VOICE

Call her sister! If no one's answering

at the house....

CAROLINE'S VOICE

I called her sister, Mr. Lowery,

where she works, the Music Makers

Music Store, you know? And she doesn't

know where Mary is any more than we

do.

LOWERY'S VOICE

You better run out to the house.

She may be... unable to answer the

phone...

CAROLINE'S VOICE

Her sister's going to do that.  She's

as worried as we are.

LOWERY'S VOICE

No! I haven't the faintest idea.  As

I said, I last saw your sister when

she left this office on Friday...

she said she didn't feel well and

wanted to leave early and I said she

could. And that was the last I saw...

(a pause, a thought)

...wait a minute, I did see her, an

hour or so later, driving...

(a pause, then with

solemn fear)

Ah, I think you'd better come over

here to my office. Quick.

(a pause, a click)

Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

LOWERY'S VOICE

After all, Cassidy, I told you...

all that cash... I'm not taking the

responsibility... Oh, for heaven's

sake, a girl works for you for ten

years, you trust her! All right,

yes, you better come over.

CASSIDY'S VOICE

(undrunk, sharp with

rage)

Well I ain't about to kiss off forty

thousand dollars! I'll get it back

and if any of it's missin' I'll

replace it with her fine soft flesh!

I'll track her, never you doubt it!

LOWERY'S VOICE

Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't

believe... it must be some kind of a

mystery... I can't...

CASSIDY'S VOICE

You checked with the bank, no?  They

never laid eyes on her, no?  You

still trustin'? Hot creepers, she

sat there while I dumped it out...

hardly even looked at it, plannin'

and... and even flirtin' with me...!

NORMAN

Dirty night.

MARY

(not really a question)

You have a vacancy?

NORMAN

(simply, almost

cheerfully)

We have twelve vacancies. Twelve

cabins, twelve vacancies.

(a pause)

They moved away the highway.

MARY

I thought I'd gotten off the main...

NORMAN

I knew you must have. No one stops

here anymore unless they do.

NORMAN

But it's no good dwelling on our

losses, is it.  We go right ahead

lighting signs and following the

formalities...  Would you sign,

please.

NORMAN

Your home address. Oh, just the town

will do.

MARY

(glancing at newspaper

sticking out of her

handbag)

Los Angeles.

NORMAN

Cabin One. It's closer in case you

want anything... right next to the

office.

MARY

I want sleep more than anything.

Except maybe, food.

NORMAN

There's a big diner about ten miles

on up... just outside Fairvale.

MARY

Am I that close to Fairvale?

NORMAN

Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

NORMAN

Stuffy in here.

(turns to her)

Well... the mattress is soft and

there're hangers in the closet and...

stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed

on it in case you want to make your

friends back home envious... and...

the... over there....

(he points to the

bathroom, fairly

blushes)

MARY

The bathroom.

NORMAN

(quickly, starting to

leave)

I'll be in the office if you want

anything... just tap on the wall.

MARY

Thank you, Mr. Bates.

NORMAN

Norman Bates.

NORMAN

You have something most girls never

have.

MARY

I have?

NORMAN

There's no name for it... But it's

something that, that puts a person

at ease.

MARY

Thank you. Again.

NORMAN

(not really a question)

You're not going to go out again and

drive up to that diner, are you?

MARY

No.

NORMAN

Then will you do me a favor?

(without waiting for

her response)

Will you have supper here?  I was

just about to, myself... nothing

more than some sandwiches and a lot

of milk, but I'd like it if you'd

come up to the house and... I don't

set a fancy table but... the kitchen's

awful homey.

MARY

I'd like to.

NORMAN

All right, you get your dresses

hanging out and... change those wet

shoes, and I'll come for you soon as

it's ready...

(starts out)

...with my trusty umbrella.

(he laughs a small

laugh, runs off)

WOMAN'S VOICE

No! I tell you no!

WOMAN'S VOICE

I won't have you bringing strange

young girls in for supper...

(an ugly, sneering

note creeps into the

voice)

...by candlelight, I suppose, in the

cheap erotic fashion of young men

with cheap, erotic minds!

NORMAN'S VOICE

Mother, please...

WOMAN'S VOICE

And then what? After supper, music?

Whispers?

NORMAN'S VOICE

Mother, she's just a stranger...

hungry, and the weather's bad...

WOMAN'S VOICE

(mimicking cruelly)

Mother, she's just a stranger!

(hard, cruel again)

As if men don't desire strangers, as

if... oh, I refuse to speak of

disgusting things because they disgust

me! You understand, Boy?

WOMAN'S VOICE

(pause)

Go on, go tell her she'll not be

appeasing her ugly appetite with my

food... or my son! Or do I have to

tell her, cause you don't have the

guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts,

boy?

NORMAN'S VOICE

(blurted cut fury and

shame)

Shut up! Shut up!

MARY

I've caused you some trouble.

NORMAN

Mother...

(a hollow little laugh,

an attempt at sardonic

humor)

...what is the phrase... "she isn't

herself today"... I think that's it.

MARY

(looking at the tray)

You shouldn't have bothered. I really

don't have that much of an appetite.

NORMAN

I'm sorry. I wish... people could

apologize for other people.

MARY

Don't worry about it.

(a warm smile)

But as long as you've made us supper,

we may as well eat it. Huh?

NORMAN

It might be nicer... warmer in the

office.

NORMAN

Eating in an office...

(a rueful smile)

...to officious, even for me. I have

the parlor behind this... if you'd

like.

NORMAN

Please sit down. On the sofa.

MARY

You're very... kind.

NORMAN

It's all for you. I'm not hungry.

Please go ahead.

NORMAN

You eat like a bird.

MARY

You'd know, of course.

NORMAN

Not really. I hear that expression,

that one eats "like a bird," is really

a falsie, I mean a falsity, because

birds eat a tremendous lot.

(A pause, then

explaining)

Oh, I don't know anything about birds.

My hobby is stuffing things...

taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather

stuff birds because...  well, I hate

the look of beasts when they're

stuffed, foxes and chimps and all...

some people even stuff dogs and

cats... but I can't... I think only

birds look well stuffed because

they're rather...  passive, to begin

with... most of them...

MARY

It's a strange hobby. Curious, I

mean.

NORMAN

Uncommon, too.

MARY

I imagine so.

NORMAN

It's not as expensive as you'd think.

Cheap, really. Needles, thread,

sawdust .. the chemicals are all

that cost anything.

(He goes quiet, looks

disturbed)

MARY

A man should have a hobby.

NORMAN

It's more than a hobby... sometimes...

a hobby is supposed to pass the time,

not fill it.

MARY

(after a pause, softly)

Is your time so empty?

NORMAN

Oh, no!

(forcing brightness

again)

I run the office, tend the cabins

and grounds, do little chores for

mother... the ones she allows I might

be capable of doing.

MARY

You go out... with friends?

NORMAN

Friends? Who needs friends.

(Laughs, then with

gallows humor)

A boy's best friend is his mother.

(Stops laughing)

You've never had an empty moment in

your whole life. Have you?

MARY

Only my share.

NORMAN

Where are you going? I don't mean to

pry...

MARY

(A wistful smile)

I'm looking for a private island.

NORMAN

What are you running away from?

MARY

(Alert)

Why do you ask that?

NORMAN

No. People never run away from

anything.

(A pause)

The rain didn't last very long.

(Turning suddenly)

You know what I think? I think we're

all in our private traps, clamped in

them, and none of us can ever climb

out. We scratch and claw... but only

at the air, only at each other, and

for all of it, we never budge an

inch.

MARY

Sometimes we deliberately step into

those traps.

NORMAN

I was born in mine. I don't mind it

anymore.

MARY

You should... mind it.

NORMAN

Oh I do... but I say I don't.

(Laughs boyishly)

MARY

(Staring at him,

shaking her head

softly.)

If anyone ever spoke to me, the way

I heard... The way she spoke to you,

I don't think I could ever laugh

again.

NORMAN

(Controlled resentment)

Sometimes when she talks that way to

me I'd like to... curse her out and

leave her forever!

(A rueful smile)

Or at least, defy her.

(A pause, a hopeless

shrug)

But I couldn't. She's ill.

MARY

She sounded strong...

NORMAN

I mean... ill.

(A pause)

She had to raise me all by herself

after my dad died... I was only

five... and it must have been a

strain. Oh, she didn't have to go

out to work or anything, Dad left us

with a little something... anyway, a

few years ago... Mother met a man.

He talked her into building this

motel... We could have talked her

into anything... and when.  Well...

It was just too much for her when he

died, too... And the way he died...

Oh, it's nothing to talk about when

you're eating.

(Pauses, smiles)

Anyway, it was too much of a loss

for my mother... she had nothing

left.

MARY

(Critically)

Except you.

NORMAN

A son is a poor substitute for a

lover.

(Turns away as if in

distaste of the word)

MARY

Why don't you go away?

NORMAN

To a private island, like you?

MARY

No, not like me.

NORMAN

It's too late for me. And besides...

who'd look after her? She'd be alone

up there, the fire would go out...

damp and cold, like a grave. When

you love someone, you don't do that

to them, even if you hate them. Oh,

I don't hate her.  I hate... what

she's become. I hate... the illness.

MARY

(Slowly, carefully)

Wouldn't it be better if you put her

in... someplace...

NORMAN

An Institution? A madhouse?  People

always call a madhouse "someplace."

(Mimicing coldly)

Put her in Someplace!

MARY

I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to

sound uncaring...

NORMAN

(The coldness turning

to tight fury)

What do you mean about caring?  Have

you ever seen one of those places?

Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel

eyes studying you... and my mother

there?  Why? has she harmed you?

She's as harmless as... one of these

stuffed birds.

MARY

I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed

she was harming you. I meant...

NORMAN

(High fury now)

Well? You meant well?  People always

mean well, they cluck their thick

tongues and shake their heads and

suggest so very delicately that...

NORMAN

(Quietly)

I've suggested it myself. But I hate

to even think such a thing.  She

needs me... and it isn't...

(Looks up with a

childlike pleading

in his eyes)

...it isn't as if she were a maniac,

a raving thing... it's just that...

sometimes she goes a little mad. We

all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't

you?

MARY

(After a long

thoughtful pause)

Yes, and just one time can be enough.

(Rises)

Thank you.

NORMAN

(Cheerfully, correcting)

Thank you, Norman.

MARY

Norman.

NORMAN

You're not going to... to your room

already?

MARY

I'm very tired. And I'll have a long

drive tomorrow. All the way back to

Phoenix.

NORMAN

Phoenix?

MARY

I stepped into a private trap back

there -- and I want to go back and...

try to pull myself out.

(Looking close at

Norman)

Before it's too late for me, too.

NORMAN

(Looking at her)

Why don't you stay a little while,

just for talking.

MARY

I'd like to, but...

NORMAN

Alright. I'll see you in the morning.

I'll bring you breakfast.  What time

will you...

MARY

Very early. Dawn.

NORMAN

Alright, Miss...

(He has forgotten her

name)

MARY

Crane.

NORMAN

That's it.

(He frowns, as if

bothered by not being

able to match the

name to the memory

of the name in the

registration book)

MARY

Good night.

LILA

Sam?

SUMMERFIELD

You want to see Sam?

LILA

Sam Loomis.

SUMMERFIELD

(yelling toward back

room)

Sam! Lady wants to see you!

SAM

Yes?

LILA

May I talk to you?

SAM

(a bit mystified)

Sure...

LILA

I'm Mary's sister.

SAM

Lila.

LILA

(quickly)

Is Mary here?

SAM

Is something wrong?

LILA

I want to know if my sister is here.

SAM

Here?

LILA

With you.

SAM

Where?

LILA

I don't know where. In your store,

somewhere in your town... anywhere.

SAM

What's the matter?

LILA

Don't you know?

WOMAN CUSTOMER

All I can do is hope if it isn't

painless, it's quick!

SAM

What should I know?

LILA

To begin with, where Mary is. Do

you?

SAM

No. I take it you don't either?

(As Lila shakes her

head)

How long?

LILA

Last Friday. She left work, and

home... I was in Tucson over the

weekend... I haven't heard from her,

not even a phone call.

SAM

And you thought she'd come up here,

to me? If she had, what reason would

she have for not calling you?

LILA

A good reason, I suppose.

SAM

(Slightly exasperated)

Well what do you think, we eloped or

something? Or we're living in sin

and...

LILA

Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being

defensive that you haven't even

reacted to the most serious fact of

all. Mary is missing.

SAM

I was getting to that!

LILA

What do you know about it?

SAM

Nothing! You're putting me on the

defensive.

LILA

Look, if you two are in this thing

together, I don't care, it's none of

my business... But I want to see

Mary. I want her to tell me she's

all right and it's none of my

business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix

and...

SAM

Bob? Run out and get yourself some

lunch.

SUMMERFIELD

It's okay, Sam, I brought it with

me.

SAM

Run out and eat it.

SAM

What thing?

LILA

Huh?

SAM

What thing could we be in together?

LILA

(A pause)

I hate tears.

(Takes out hankie)

SAM

Is Mary... in trouble?

LILA

Yes.

SAM

Well why didn't she come to me...

call me...?

LILA

Not that kind...

(Almost a smile)

You men and your egos.

SAM

(Seriously)

Never mind my ego. Let's talk about

Mary.

ARBOGAST

Let's all talk about Mary.

SAM

Who are you, friend?

ARBOGAST

Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.

(To Lila)

Where is she, Miss Crane?

LILA

I don't know.

ARBOGAST

Wouldn't have been able to tail you

if you did.

SAM

What's your interest?

ARBOGAST

Money.

SAM

Somebody better tell me what's going

on and tell me fast! I can take so

much and then...

ARBOGAST

(Interrupting calmly)

Your girl friend stole forty thousand

dollars.

SAM

Why?

ARBOGAST

(An almost amused

smile)

Must've needed it.

SAM

What are you talking about?

(To Lila)

What is this?

LILA

She was supposed to bank it, on

Friday, for her boss. She didn't.

ARBOGAST

(Looking at Sam)

Someone has seen her. Someone always

sees a girl with forty thousand

dollars.

(To Sam)

She is your girl friend, isn't she?

LILA

Sam, they don't want to prosecute,

they just want the money back. It

was all in cash...

ARBOGAST

(Correcting with

Cassidy's word)

Casharoonie!

LILA

Sam, if she's here...

SAM

She isn't!

ARBOGAST

You came up here on a hunch, Miss

Crane? Nothing more? No phone call...

from him, or from your sister herself?

LILA

(wearily)

Not even a hunch. Just hope.

ARBOGAST

With a little checking, I could get

to believe you.

LILA

(anxiously)

I don't care if you do or... I want

to see Mary... before she gets in

any deeper...

SAM

Did you check in Phoenix...

hospitals... maybe she had an

accident... a hold-up...

ARBOGAST

She was seen leaving town in her

car. Seen by her very victims, I

might add.

SAM

(after a moment)

I don't believe it.

(to Lila, slowly)

Do you?

LILA

(a thoughtful pause)

Yes... I just... did. The moment

they told me...

SAM

You might have doubted for say five

minutes or so, Sister.

ARBOGAST

We're always quickest to doubt people

who have a record for being honest.

I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where

there's a boyfriend...

(Trails off, smiles

encouragingly)

She won't be back there among the

nuts and bolts... but she'll be in

this town... somewhere. I'll find

her.

LILA

I just listened... and believed

everything they told me. 'She stole

the money.' 'We don't want to get

her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the

police in'...

SAM

It was her boss' idea not to report

it to the police?

LILA

No. The man whose money she... he

talked so loud and fast, and I... I

should've called the police.

SAM

He must have had a darn good reason

for wanting them kept out of it...

All that cash...

LILA

I ought to call the police right

now!

SAM

No.

LILA

Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?

Are you two planning to go away with

the money?

SAM

How could I go away? I'm in debt up

to my...

(Smiles at the

incongruity of his

reply, then goes

serious)

If she did steal that money...  It's

hard to believe she did because it's

hard to see why she would. Unless

she had some wild idea that it would

help me... us...

LILA

She haven't even called you?

SAM

I didn't see her... and I didn't

hear from her! Believe that!

LILA

I need to... I need to believe

something. This is the first time

I've ever come up against anything I

couldn't... understand.

SAM

You've led a charmed life.

LILA

No. I just think... anything can be

explained. But Mary, doing a thing

like this... I don't know how to

handle...

SAM

Maybe we can handle it together.

(He smiles

encouragingly)

LILA

(A rueful shrug)

I came flying up here expecting to

get some explanation... for all I

know, she may be trying to get in

touch with me, at home. I'd better

go home.

SAM

(A thoughtful pause)

I think she'll contact me if she

contacts anybody. Why don't you stay

here. When she shows up... or calls...

be here.

LILA

(A long study, her

suspicion of him

evaporating)

You want me to stay here?

SAM

She'll need both of us.

LILA

(considers, then:)

Where... can I stay?

SAM

(brightly)

First rate hotel, fifty yards up the

street. Come on.

(as he reaches for

the closed-for-lunch

sign)

After we check you in we'll go to

the drugstore and get you a sandwich.

Then we'll come back here... and

wait.

NORMAN

(shoving sock in his

pocket)

I always forget to put the sign on,

but we do have vacancy.

(Cheerfully)

Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve

vacancies.

ARBOGAST

(pleasantly)

In the past two days I've been to so

many motels, my eyes are bleary with

neon. This is the first one that

looked like it was hiding from the

world at large.

NORMAN

I don't really forget the sign, it

just doesn't seem... any use.

(Points)

This used to be the main highway.

(Starts for office)

Want to register, please?

ARBOGAST

Sit down. I don't want to trouble

you, just want to ask...

NORMAN

No trouble. Today's linen day. I

change all the beds once a week,

whether they've been used or not...

dampness. I hate the smell of

dampness.

(Opening office door)

It's such a dank smell.

NORMAN

You out to buy a motel?

ARBOGAST

No.

NORMAN

Oh. I thought... you said you'd been

to so many in two days...  What was

it you wanted to ask?

ARBOGAST

I'm looking for a missing person.

(takes out and opens

wallet and extends

it as he speaks)

My name's Arbogast, private

investigator...

(takes back wallet

when Norman doesn't

look at it)

Trying to trace a young girl who's

been missing almost a week. From

Phoenix.

(A look at Norman's

frightened expression)

It's a private matter... family wants

to forgive her...

(smiles)

She isn't in trouble.

NORMAN

(forcing a smile)

I didn't think the police went

searching for people who weren't in

trouble.

ARBOGAST

I'm not the police.

NORMAN

Oh.

ARBOGAST

We have reason to believe she came

this way... might have stopped in

this area...

(extends photograph,

which Norman doesn't

glance at)

Did she stop here?

NORMAN

No. No one has stopped here in

weeks...

ARBOGAST

Mind looking at the picture before

committing yourself?

NORMAN

Committing myself to what? You sure

talk like a Policeman.

ARBOGAST

Look at the picture. Please.

NORMAN

No. At least I don't recall.

ARBOGAST

She might have used an alias. Mary

Crane's the real name, but she

might've registered...

NORMAN

(interrupting)

I don't even bother with guests

registering any more... I mean, little

by little, you drop the formalities.

(more relaxed, because

Arbogast is listening

with a pleasant smile)

I shouldn't even bother to change

the linen. I guess habits die hard.

Which reminds me...

NORMAN

The vacancy sign. Just in case.

ARBOGAST

Now there's a couple even remarking

about your sign, and see how easily

you forgot them?

NORMAN

What?

ARBOGAST

You thought no one has stopped here

in weeks. Now, try to remember if

this girl...

ARBOGAST

(A pause, a study)

Maybe she even signed the register...

because habits die hard. Let's check

it, huh?

ARBOGAST

Yes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting

alias.

ARBOGAST

Don't know where she got "Marie,"

but "Samuels" figures. Her boy

friend's name is Sam.

(Turns to Norman, the

smile gone)

Was she in disguise? Or do you want

to check the picture again?

NORMAN

I didn't lie to you. I just have

trouble keeping track of... time.

NORMAN

It was raining and her hair didn't

look like that... damped out, I guess.

ARBOGAST

Tell me all about her.

NORMAN

She arrived kind of late, wet and

hungry and she was very tired and

went right to bed and left early.

ARBOGAST

How early?

NORMAN

Very early. Dawn.

ARBOGAST

Of which morning?

NORMAN

The following morning. Sunday.

ARBOGAST

No one met her?

NORMAN

No.

ARBOGAST

Or arrived with her.

NORMAN

No.

ARBOGAST

She didn't call anyone? Even locally?

NORMAN

No.

ARBOGAST

You didn't spend the whole night

with her did you?

NORMAN

No! Of all...

ARBOGAST

How do you know she didn't make a

call?

NORMAN

She was tired. She said she had a

long drive ahead of her, in the

morning... Yes, now I'm remembering

very clearly because I'm picturing.

When you make a picture of the moment

in your mind, you can remember every

detail. She was sitting back there,

no she was standing up, with some

sandwich still in her hand, and she

said she had to drive a long way.

ARBOGAST

Back where?

NORMAN

What do you mean?

ARBOGAST

You said she was sitting "back there,"

or standing rather...

NORMAN

Oh. My private parlor. She had an

awful hunger... so I made her some

supper. And then she went to bed and

left in the morning. I didn't even

see her leave.

ARBOGAST

How did she pay you?

NORMAN

What?

ARBOGAST

Cash or check? For the cabin...

NORMAN

Cash.

ARBOGAST

And when she left, she never came

back.

NORMAN

Why should she? I'm sorry, I have

work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...

ARBOGAST

I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't

aspic!

(smiles)

This ain't jelling.

NORMAN

I don't know what you expect me to

know about... people come and go...

ARBOGAST

She isn't still here, is she?

NORMAN

Not at all!

ARBOGAST

Suppose I wanted to search the cabins,

all twelve... would I need a warrant?

NORMAN

(as if pleasantly

exasperated)

Look, if you won't believe me, go

ahead. You can help me make beds if

you like.

(laughs, shakes his

head)

Come on.

CUT TO:

NORMAN

Change your mind?

NORMAN

I guess I've got one of those faces

you can't help believing.

ARBOGAST

(to Norman, but

continuing to stare

at the house)

Anyone at home?

NORMAN

I live there. Alone.

ARBOGAST

Someone is sitting in that window.

NORMAN

My mother.

NORMAN

She's... ill. Confined to her room.

It's practically living alone.

ARBOGAST

(after a pause)

If this girl Mary Crane were here,

you'd have no reason to hide her

would you?

NORMAN

Of course not.

ARBOGAST

If she paid you well?

NORMAN

Now, look...!

ARBOGAST

Or if she had you say... gallantly

protecting her... you wouldn't be

fooled... you'd know she was just

using you. Wouldn't you?

NORMAN

I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable

of being fooled! Not even by women!

ARBOGAST

I didn't mean that as a slur on your

manhood. I'm sorry.

NORMAN

(disturbed now)

That's all right. maybe she could

have fooled me.  But...

(a rueful smile)

She didn't fool my mother.

ARBOGAST

Your mother met her?

(quickly)

Can I talk to your mother?

NORMAN

No. I told you, she's confined...

ARBOGAST

Just for a moment. She might have

picked up a hint you'd miss.

ARBOGAST

Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I

won't disturb...

NORMAN

No! Just no!  I have one of those

breaking points like any other man,

believe it or not, and I'm near it.

There's just so much pushing I can

take and I think...

ARBOGAST

All right!

(starts away, toward

his car, pauses)

Might save me a lot of leg-work if I

could just talk to your mother.  But

I'd need a warrant for that, won't

I?

Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.

(waits)

Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it

might make you feel a little better.

Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday

night at Bates'  Motel, out here on

the old highway.

(listens)

Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent

the night, left, period!

(listens)

I did question him, believe me. I

think I got all there was to get.

Just have to try to pick up the scent

from here.

(listens)

Well... maybe that's because I don't

feel entirely satisfied.  He's got a

sick old mother, confined type, and

I think she saw Mary and talked to

her. Shame, too... confined old women

love to talk to strangers.

(listens)

I was, but I think I'll go back to

the motel, first.

(listens)

No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis.

I should be back in an hour.

(listens)

All right. And Lila... You'll be

happy to know what I think. I think

our friend Sam Loomis didn't even

know Mary was here.

See you in an hour. Or less.

LILA

Are we just going to go on sitting

here?

SAM

(suddenly cheerful)

He'll be back. Let's sit still and

hang on, okay?

LILA

You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

SAM

Hundreds! Which one is your pet?

LILA

Whenever I start contemplating the

panic button, your back straightens

up and your eyes get that God-looks-

SAM

I feel better when you feel better.

LILA

(a pause - then she

rises)

Where's the old highway?

SAM

You want to run out there, bust in

on Arbogast and the sick old lady,

shake her up and maybe spoil

everything Arbogast's been building

for the last three hours.

LILA

Yes.

SAM

That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

LILA

Patience doesn't run in our family.

Sam, I'm going out there!

SAM

Arbogast said...

LILA

An hour! Or less!

SAM

(into phone)

Got the number of the motel out on

the old highway? Bates, I think.

(waits)

LILA

Sam! Why call when we can go?

SAM

And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?

(into phone)

Thanks.

SAM

(to Lila)

Probably on his way back right now.

LILA

Sam, I'm going.

SAM

(hangs up and picks

up his jacket)

You'll never find it.

SAM

Stay here.

LILA

Why can't I go out there with you?

SAM

(looks at her)

I don't know...

(he collects himself)

One of us has to be here in case

Arbogast's on the way.

door... or unwilling.

LILA

Where could he have gone?

SAM

Maybe he got some definite lead.

Maybe he went right on...

LILA

Without calling me?

SAM

In a hurry.

LILA

Sam, he called me when he had nothing

definite, nothing but a dissatisfied

feeling. Don't you think he'd have

called if he had anything...

SAM

(interrupting)

Yes. I think he would have.

SAM

Let's go see Al Chambers.

LILA

Well?

No. I'm just procrastinating.  People

hate when the doorbell rings in the

middle of the night.

(gives up, starts out)

Come on.

MRS. CHAMBERS

Oh?

SAM

Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering

you...

MRS. CHAMBERS

You didn't!

Let's go out back and have some coca

while the men are talking.

LILA

No, thank you. It's my problem, too.

SAM

I don't know where to start...

(a look at Lila)

Except at the beginning.

LILA

Yes.

SAM

(to Sheriff)

This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.

She's been here for a few days,

looking for her sister. There's a

private detective helping... and,

well, we got a call tonight, from

this detective, saying he'd traced

Mary...

MRS. CHAMBERS

Mary is Lila's sister?

SAM

Yes. He traced her to that motel,

out on the old highway...

MRS. CHAMBERS

(to the Sheriff)

Bates' Motel.

(to Lila)

He has a mind like a mechanical brain

and the more information you feed

it... Go on, Sam.

SAM

He traced her there and called us to

say he was going to question Mrs.

Bates...

MRS. CHAMBERS

(a pleasant shock)

Norman took a wife?

SAM

No. An old woman, his mother.

(to Sheriff, quickly)

That was early this evening. And we

haven't seen or heard from him since.

I went out to the motel, just got

back. No one was in the office, and...

LILA

(interrupting,

anxiously)

Will you help us? I think something's

wrong out there!

SHERIFF

(after a considerate

pause)

Now. Your sister is missing how long?

LILA

She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday.

And no trace until...

SHERIFF

How'd you and this detective come to

trace her to Fairvale?

SAM

They thought she'd be coming to me.

SHERIFF

Left Phoenix under her own steam?

LILA

Yes.

SHERIFF

(a pause)

She ain't missing so much as she's

run away.

SAM

Yes.

SHERIFF

From what?

LILA

(a look at sam, then:)

She stole some money.

SHERIFF

A lot?

LILA

Forty thousand dollars.

SHERIFF

And the police haven't been able

to...

SAM

(interrupting)

Everyone concerned thought... if

they could get her to give back the

money... they could avoid involving

her with the police.

SHERIFF

Explains the private detective. He

traced her to the Bates place.  What'd

he exactly say when he called you?

LILA

Mary had been there, one night, and

had left.

SHERIFF

With the forty thousand dollars?

LILA

He didn't mention the money.

(anxiously)

What he said on the phone isn't

important, is it?  He was supposed

to come back after he spoke to the

mother, and he didn't! That's what I

want you to do something about!

SHERIFF

Like what?

LILA

Go out there! Find somebody, ask

some questions!

(a pause)

I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to

you. I keep thinking... something's

wrong. I have to know what!

SHERIFF

I think something's wrong, too, Miss.

But not the same thing. I think your

private detective is what's wrong.

(As Lila is about to

object)

I think he got himself a hot lead as

to where your sister was going...

probably from Norman Bates...  and

called you to keep you still while

he took off after her and the money.

LILA

He said he was dissatisfied... and

was going back.

MRS. CHAMBERS

(to Sheriff)

Why don't you call Norman and let

him say just what happened, if he

give the man a hot lead and he did

just scooted off... it'll make the

girl feel better, Albert.

SHERIFF

At this hour?

SAM

He was out when I was there. If he's

back he probably isn't even in bed

yet.

SHERIFF

He wasn't out when you were there.

He just wasn't answering the door in

the dead of night... like some people

do. This fellow lives like a hermit...

MRS. CHAMBERS

Recluse. Kinder word.

SHERIFF

(to Sam)

You must remember that bad business

out there. About ten years ago...

SAM

I've only been here five. Right now

it feels like ten, but...

LILA

All right! Then call! At least, call!

MRS. CHAMBERS

(into phone)

Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to

connect him with the Bates Motel.

SHERIFF

Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

(listens)

Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we

got some worries here. Did you have

a man stop out there tonight...

(listens)

Well, this one wouldn't be a customer,

anyway. A private detective, name

of...

MRS. CHAMBERS

Arbogast.

SHERIFF

(into phone)

Arbogast.

(listens)

And after he left?

(listens)

No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been

going out there?

(listens)

Well, I think you oughta unload that

place and open up closer in to the

action, a smaller place, you know...

but...

LILA

Please!

SHERIFF

(into phone)

Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to

sleep. Yeah, be glad to.

(hangs up, turns to

Mrs. Chambers)

Said to give you his regards.

SAM

(faint irony)

Was that all?

SHERIFF

This detective was out there and

Norman told him about the girl and

the detective thanked him and went

away.

LILA

And he didn't go back? Didn't see

the mother?

SHERIFF

You should've called in the police

the second you found your sister has

skipped. You go starting private

investigations, using people you

don't even know...

LILA

What difference does that...

SHERIFF

Your Detective told you a nakedfaced

lie.

MRS. CHAMBERS

Barefaced.

SHERIFF

He told you he wasn't coming right

back cause he wanted to question

Norman Bates' mother, right?

LILA

Yes.

SHERIFF

(a pause, then calmly)

Norman Bates' mother has been dead

and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for

the last ten years!

MRS. CHAMBERS

I helped Norman pick out the dress

she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

SHERIFF

It ain't only local history, Sam,

it's the only murder-and-suicide

case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.

Bates poisoned this guy she was...

involved with, when she found out he

was married, then took a helping of

the same stuff herself.  Strychnine.

Ugly way to die.

MRS. CHAMBERS

Norman found them dead together.  In

bed.

SAM

You mean that old woman I saw sittin'

in the window wasn't Norman Bates'

mother?

MRS. CHAMBERS

(hopefully, happily)

Maybe you saw Mary!

SAM

I'd know the difference between Mary

and an old woman.

SHERIFF

Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you

saw an old woman?

SAM

Yes! In the house behind the motel.

I pounded and called but she... just

ignored me.

SHERIFF

And you want to tell me you saw Norman

Bates' mother.

LILA

It must've been. Arbogast said so,

too... and he said the young man

wouldn't let him see her because she

was ill!

SHERIFF

Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.

Bates... who's that woman buried out

at Greenlawn Cemetery?

QUICK CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOTHER'S VOICE

I am sorry, boy, but you do manage

to look ludicrous when you give me

orders!

NORMAN'S VOICE

Please, mother...

MOTHER'S VOICE

(Sharp, laughter all

gone)

No! I will not hide in the fruit

cellar!

(A shrill laugh)

Think I'm fruity, huh?

(Hard, cold again)

I'm staying right here!  This is my

room and no one will drag me out of

it... least of all my big bold son!

NORMAN'S VOICE

(Rising now, anxiously)

They'll come now, Mother. He came

after the girl and now someone will

come after him! How long do you think

you can go on... Mother, please,

just for a few days, just so they

won't find you!

MOTHER'S VOICE

(Mimicking)

Just for a few days...

(Furious)

In that dank fruit cellar? No!  You

hid me there once, boy, and you won't

do it again! Not ever again!  Now

get out!

(A pause, quiet)

I told you to get out, boy!

(A longer pause)

Norman! What do you think you're

going to do? Don't you touch me!

Don't! Norman!

(A pause, then

cajolingly)

All right, son, put me down and I'll

go. I'll go on my own two feet. I

can go on my own two feet, can't I?

NORMAN'S VOICE

I'll carry you, mother.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM

We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd

go out to the motel with you.

MRS. CHAMBERS

He's already been.

SHERIFF

Went out before service.

MRS. CHAMBERS

Have you two had breakfast?

SAM

(To Sheriff, not a

question)

You didn't find anything.

SHERIFF

Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.

LILA

(Interrupting)

Did he say anything about my sister?

SHERIFF

Just what he told your detective.

SAM

No mother.

SHERIFF

You must've seen an illusion, Sam.

Now, I know you're not the seeing-

illusion type... But no woman was

illusion there and I don't believe

in ghosts, so there it is!

LILA

I still feel...

SHERIFF

Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't

make you feel better. You want to

come to my office this afternoon and

report a missing person... And the

theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner

you drop this thing in the lap of

the law, that's the sooner you'll

stand a chance of your sister bein'

picked up. How about that?

LILA

I don't know.

MRS. CHAMBERS

It's Sunday. Come over and do the

reporting at the house, 'round dinner

time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.

SAM

Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.

LILA

You're not.

SAM

Want me to drop you at the hotel?

Or you want to come over to the store?

LILA

I won't feel satisfied unless I got

out there, Sam.

SAM

Neither will I.

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.

SAM

Of course we will.

LILA

Alive.

LILA

We lived together all our lives.

SAM

Where'd you go to college?

LILA

I didn't. I got a job, too.

(A pause)

I wonder if that hurt her, my not

letting her sacrifice for me?  Some

people are so willing to suffer for

you that they suffer more if you

don't let them.

SAM

(Almost to himself)

She was willing to lick the stamps.

LILA

I wonder so many things about her

now.  Why she never told me about

you...  Funny, when you think there's

an answer to everything, you think

you know all the answers.

SAM

We were going to get married. Are

going to get married!

LILA

Do you know how I found out about

you? I found one of your letters...

it was a nice letter, Sam.

SAM

This is the old highway.

LILA

I suppose... when you were able to

marry her she'd have presented you,

all shiny and proper... she always

tried to be proper.

SAM

Watch your tenses.

LILA

Huh?

SAM

She always tries to be proper.

LILA

You going to wait here for me?

SAM

I'm going with you. But we'd better

decide what we're going to say and

do when we walk in...

LILA

We're going to register. As man and

wife. And get shown to a cabin...

and then search every inch of that

place, inside and... outside.

SAM

You won't believe it...

(Starts motor)

But this will be the first time

I've ever pulled one of those man-

and-wife-renting-cabin capers!

LILA

(A tiny smile, first

in hours)

I believe it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SAM

(Unconsciously

whispering)

I wonder where Norman Bates does his

hermiting?

LILA

Someone was at that window. I saw

the curtain move.

SAM

Come on.

SAM

(Cheerfully)

Just coming up to ring for you.

NORMAN

(Coming forward)

I suppose you want a cabin.

SAM

We'd hoped to make it straight to

San Francisco, but we don't like the

look of that sky. Looks like a bad

day coming... doesn't it.

NORMAN

I'll take you to...

SAM

Better sign in first, hasn't we?

NORMAN

It isn't necessary.

SAM

(Interrupting with a

friendly cheerfulness)

Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this

trip... ninety percent business...

and he wants practically notarized

receipts. I better sign in and get a

receipt.

NORMAN

I'll get your bags.

SAM

Haven't any.

NORMAN

(after a stare)

I'll show you the cabin.

SAM

First time I've seen it happen.

(to Lila)

Check in any place in this country

without bags, and you have to pay in

advance.

NORMAN

Ten dollars...

SAM

That receipt...?

LILA

I'll start ahead.

SAM

(To Norman, who is

following)

Don't bother yourself... we'll find

it.

LILA

We should have asked for Cabin One...

The one Mary was in.

SAM

I'm glad we didn't.

LILA

We have to go into that cabin and

search it, Sam... no matter what

we're afraid of finding and no matter

how much it may hurt.

SAM

I know.

(A pause)

Do you think if something happened,

it happened there?

LILA

(A pause, then:)

Sam, if you owned a useless business

like this motel... one you probably

couldn't even sell...  what would

you need to get away, to start a new

business, somewhere else?

(As Sam studies her)

Forty thousand dollars?

SAM

How could we prove...

(An almost hopeless

laugh)

Well, if he opens a new motel on the

new highway... say, a year from now...

LILA

There must be some proof that exists

right now! Something that proves he

got that money away from Mary...

Some way!

SAM

What makes you sound so certain?

LILA

Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or

felt sorry for me... and he was

starting to feel the same about you.

I heard it when he called... in his

voice, a caring. He wouldn't have

gone anywhere or done anything without

telling us.  Unless he was stopped.

And he was stopped, so he must have

found out something!

SAM

We'll start with Cabin One.

SAM

If he sees us... we're just taking

the air.

SAM

Bates?

SAM

Sorry.

LILA

Hospital clean.

SAM

What?

LILA

The bathroom. Look at how clean it

is. The one in our cabin is clean...

but this is clean!

SAM

What is it?

LILA

It didn't get washed down. It's

figuring... the kind you tear up and

get rid of.

(Extending her finger

toward Sam)

Some figure has been added to or

subtracted from... forty thousand.

LILA

That's proof Mary was here!  It would

be too wild a coincidence for somebody

else to...

SAM

(Reminding)

Bates never denied Mary was here.

LILA

(Reminded)

Yes.

(A thought)

But maybe this proves that Bates

found out about the money.

SAM

Do we simply ask him where he's hidden

it?

LILA

Sam, that old woman, whoever she is.

I think she told Arbogast something!

And I want her to tell us the same

thing!

SAM

You can't go up there.

LILA

Why not?

SAM

Bates.

LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)

Let's find him. One of us can keep

him occupied while the other gets to

the woman.

SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

You won't be able to hold him still

if he doesn't want to be held. And I

don't like you going into that house

alone, Lila.

LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)

I can handle a sick old woman.

SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

All right. I'll find Bates and keep

him occupied.

SAM

Wait a minute. If you get anything

out of the mother...

(A thought)

Can you find your way back to town?

(As Lila nods yes)

If you do get anything, don't stop

to tell me.

NORMAN

Looking for me?

SAM

(Recovering)

Yes, matter of fact.

(The friendly grin)

The wife's taking a nap and... I can

never keep quiet enough for her...

so I thought I'd look you up and...

talk.

NORMAN

Satisfied with your cabin?

SAM

Fine.

SAM

(Cheerfully, as if

after a self-conscious

pause)

I've been doing all the talking so

far, haven't I?

NORMAN

Yes.

SAM

I always thought it was the people

who are alone so much who do all the

talking when they get the chance.

Yet there you are, doing all the

listening!

(A pause)

You are alone here, aren't you?

(As Norman does not

reply)

It would drive me crazy.

NORMAN

That would be a rather extreme

reaction, wouldn't it?

SAM

(Lightly)

Just an expression...

(More seriously)

What I meant was... I'd do just about

anything... to get away.  Wouldn't

you?

LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)

Mrs. Bates?

SAM

I'm not saying you shouldn't be

contented here, I'm just doubting

that you are. I think if you saw a

chance to get out from under...

you'd unload this place...

NORMAN

(Angrily)

This place! This isn't 'a place.'

It's my only world. I grew up in

that house back there. I was a happy

child. My mother and I... we were

more than happy.

SAM

And now that your mother's dead?

NORMAN

My mother is not dead!

SAM

(Softly)

I didn't think so.

SAM

(Pressing)

You look frightened. Have I been

saying something frightening?

NORMAN

I don't know what you've been saying.

SAM

I've been talking about your mother...

about your motel. How are you going

to do it?

NORMAN

Do what?

SAM

Buy a new one! In a new town!

Where you won't have to hide your

mother!

NORMAN

Shut up!

SAM

Where will you get the money to do

that, Bates... or do you already

have it... socked away... a lot of

it...

NORMAN

Leave me alone!

SAM

...Forty thousand dollars!

NORMAN

Leave me alone!

SAM

I bet your mother knows where the

money is. And what you did to get

it. And I think she'll tell us.

NORMAN

Where's that girl? The girl you came

with! Where is she?

NORMAN

(A horrible groan)

Oh, God!

LILA

Mrs. Bates...?

NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

(screaming)

Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma

Bates!

DISSOLVE TO:

TELEVISION MAN

(Indicating the front

door he has just

come in through)

You think they'll take him out that

way?

POLICEMAN

(Looking at waiting

crowd, shrugging)

Probably have to.

(A rueful smile)

Besides, the taxpayers hate it when

something gets slipped out the back

door on them!

CUT TO:

SAM

(quietly)

It's regular. Okay?

LILA

(ruefully)

I could stand something regular.

CHAMBERS

You two can go on home if you like.

(a sympathetic look

at Lila)

Making that statement was enough for

one night.

SAM

(to Lila)

Want to?

LILA

No. I'm all right. I'll feel better

when all this is explained... if it

can be.

CHAMBERS

If anybody gets any answers, it'll

be the fellow talking to him now...

the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't

reach Norman... and he knows me.

(to Lila)

You warm enough, Miss?

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

Did he talk to you?

SIMON

No. I got the whole story... but not

from Norman. I got it from... his

mother.

SIMON

Norman Bates no longer exists. He

only half-existed to begin with...

now, the other half has taken over.

Probably for all time.

LILA

(With difficulty)

Did he kill my sister?

SIMON

Yes... and no.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

Look, if you're trying to lay a lot

of psychiatric groundwork for some

sort of plea this fellow would like

to cop...

SIMON

A psychiatrist doesn't lay the

groundwork .. he merely tries to

explain it.

LILA

But my sister is...

SIMON

Yes. I'm sorry.

(to Chambers)

The Private Investigator, too. If

you drag that swamp somewhere in the

vicinity of the motel...

(To the Chief of Police)

Have you any unsolved missing persons

cases on your books?

CHIEF OF POLICE

Yes. Two.

SIMON

Young girls?

CHIEF OF POLICE

(nods, astounded,

then:)

Did he confess to...

SIMON

(interrupting)

As I said, the mother...

(Pauses, goes on afresh)

To understand it, as I understood it

hearing it from the mother...  That

is, from the mother-half of Norman's

mind, you have to go back ten years...

to the time when Norman murdered his

mother and her lover.

(A pause, then as no

one interrupts)

He was already dangerously disturbed,

had been ever since his father died.

His mother was a clinging, demanding

woman... and for years the two of

them lived as if there was no one

else in the world. Then she met a

man and it seemed to Norman she "threw

him over" for this man. That pushed

him over the thin line... and he

killed them both. Matricide is

probably the most unbearable crime

of all... and most unbearable to the

son who commit it. So he had to erase

the crime, at least in his own mind.

(A pause)

He stole her corpse... and a weighted

coffin was buried. He hid the body

in the fruit cellar, even "treated"

it to keep it as well as it would

keep. And that still wasn't enough.

She was there, but she was a corpse.

So he began to think and speak for

her, gave her half his life, so to

speak. At times he could be both

personalities, carry on

conversations... at other times, the

mother-half took over completely. He

was never all Norman, but he was

often only mother. And because he

was so pathologically jealous of

her, he assumed she was as jealous

of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong

attraction to any other woman, the

mother side of him would go wild.

(To Lila)

When Norman met your sister, he was

touched by her... and aroused by

her. He wanted her. And this set off

his "jealous mother" and...  "mother

killed the girl." After the murder,

Norman returned as if from a deep

sleep... and like a dutiful son,

covered up all traces of the crime

he was convinced his mother had

committed.

SAM

Why was he... dressed like that?

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

He's a transvestite!

SIMON

Not exactly. A man who dresses in

woman's clothing in order to achieve

a sexual change... or satisfaction...

is a transvestite.  But in Norman's

case, he was simply doing everything

possible to keep alive the illusion

of his mother being alive. And

whenever reality came too close,

when danger or desire threatened

that illusion, he'd dress up, even

to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd

walk about the house, sit in her

chair, speak in her voice... He tried

to be his mother.

(A sad smile)

And now he is.

(A pause)

That's what I meant when I said I

got the story from the mother. She

thinks Norman has been taken away...

because of his crimes.  She insists

she did nothing, that Norman committed

all the murders just to keep her

from being discovered. She even smiled

a bit coquettishly as she said that.

Of course, she feels badly about

it... but also somewhat relieved to

be, as she put it, free of Norman,

at last.

(A pause)

When the mind houses two

personalities, there is always a

battle. In Norman's case, the battle

is over... and the dominant

personality has won.

CHAMBERS

(To Simon)

And the forty thousand dollars?  Who

got that?

SIMON

The swamp. These were murders of

passion, not profit.

POLICE GUARD

He feels a little chill... can I

bring him this blanket?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)

It's sad... when a mother has to

speak the words that condemn her own

son... but I couldn't allow them to

believe that I would commit murder.

(A pause)

They'll put him away now... as I

should have... years ago. He was

always... bad. And in the end, he

intended to tell them I killed those

girls... and that man. As if I could

do anything except just sit and

stare... like one of his stuffed

birds.

(A pause)

Well, they know I can't even move a

finger. And I won't. I'll just sit

here and be quiet. Just in case they

do... suspect me.

MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)

They're probably watching me.  Well,

let them. Let them see what kind of

a person I am.

(A pause, as the fly

lights on Norman's

hand)

I'm not going to swat that fly. I

hope they are watching. They'll see...

they'll see... and they'll know...

and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't

even harm a fly...'

SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

FADE OUT

THE END
