WHITTLESLEY

Faster!  We won't make it.

DRIVER

You want to die?

WHITTLESLEY

Do you?

WHITTLESLEY

Thank God.

WHITTLESLEY

I need to speak to the captain!

Where is he?

WHITTLESLEY

Get your hands off me!  I'm trying

to save your lives, you fools!

FRANCO

American?

WHITTLESLEY

Yes.  Thank Christ somebody speaks

English.  I'm Dr. John Whittlesley.

You have some crates of mine on

board.  They were shipped by mistake

to the Natural History Museum.  We

have to get them off the boat.

FRANCO

You have I.D.?

WHITTLESLEY

No.  Let me explain.  I was on an

expedition for the museum on the

Upper Xingu.  Something horrible

happened.  I'm the only one who got

out alive.  I lost everything, my

I.D., everything.  I have to make

sure no one else dies.  The crates,

the crates were sent out before we

knew.  There's something unspeakable

inside.  If your boat leaves harbor

with those crates on board, I can't

be responsible.  My God, if they

reach New York...

FRANCO

Loco.

WHITTLESLEY

No!  I'm not crazy!  As God is my

witness, I'm telling the truth.

WHITTLESLEY

Don't do this!  You have to believe

me.  Your lives are in danger.

WHITTLESLEY

Cash.  Cash, you see?  American money.

WHITTLESLEY

No!

One of the locals found it at dawn.

Didn't believe him 'till I saw it

myself.  Even then I didn't believe

it.  Scared my men shitless.  Me too.

I mean... hell... You could smell it a

half mile away, Mr. Pendergast.

PENDERGAST

(unperturbed)

Any of your men go on board?

SMALL TOWN COP

No sir.  No way.  None of us wanted

to, I'm the first to admit it.  I

said, "Don't get within a mile of

this thing.  It's way to big for us.

I'm calling the FBI."

You walk right this minute!  Did you

hear me?!

GUARD

Morning, Dr. Green.

MARGO

Morning Joe.  Beautiful day.

HENRY

You work here?

MARGO

Yes, I do.

HENRY

What do you do?

MARGO

(leans down, amused)

I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What

do you do?

HENRY

Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's

a revolutionary what ch'a ma'

callit?

MARGO

Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how

life on earth evolved over millions

of years.

HENRY

(brightens)

Way cool.  Then you know where the

dinosaurs are.

MARGO

Fourth floor, West wing, but stay

with your class.

MARGO

Hello, Ian.  Everything ready for the

opening of the Superstition Exhibit?

CUTHBERT

I'm on my way to get the last piece

out of storage right now.

MARGO

I'd wish you luck but I'm not

superstitious.

CUTHBERT

You will be after tomorrow night.

CUTHBERT

What the... ?

CUTHBERT

No, it can't be.

CUTHBERT

Damn.

CUTHBERT

Beauregard!  You scared me half to

death.

BEAUREGARD

I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?

CUTHBERT

Someone broke into this room.

BEAUREGARD

Anything missin'?

CUTHBERT

Doesn't look like it.  We're damned

lucky.  This statue is priceless.

CUTHBERT

Mbwun.  A South American warrior

deity.  He carries a powerful curse.

Every member of the expedition that

found this statue, died.

BEAUREGARD

Looks like the curse is still at

work.

CUTHBERT

The claws are sharp... I must have

cut myself.

(uneasy laugh)

Better move these crates to the

secure storage area where they'll be

safe.

BEAUREGARD

Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr.

Cuthbert.

CUTHBERT

Why not?

BEAUREGARD

No one broke into this room, sir.

Someone broke out.  That lock was

torn off from the

inside

KAWAKITA

Third from the end!  Right shoulder.

Aleut, provenance unknown.

KAWAKITA

If I spent half the time on my

Fractal Evolution thesis that I

spend on this fly rod, I'd have my

PhD.

MARGO

(small smile)

But at what a price.

MARGO

I have the species identification on

these teeth.  We can extract DNA and

start running tests on the

extrapolator program.  Call Dr.

Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.

KAWAKITA

Margo, you haven't heard?

MARGO

What?

KAWAKITA

Frock's been fired.

MARGO

That's impossible.

KAWAKITA

(awkward)

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad

tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph.

Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the

definitive word from Cuthbert's

secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last

week.

DR. FROCK

Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess.

MARGO

Is it true?  Greg said you'd been

fired.

FROCK

Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert

so tactfully put it, the museum

needs new blood.  And since I've been

here since the Mesozoic Era --

MARGO

I don't believe it.

FROCK

Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert

has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving

makes perfect sense.  This isn't

exactly early retirement.  I've

overstayed the party a bit.

MARGO

We can't do without you.  You're one

of the foremost authorities on

primitive pharmacology.  You're

practically an institution around

here.

FROCK

That, apparently, is the problem.

I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a

Curator of Plant Biology in a museum

with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters

and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans

are the new currency of the realm.

MARGO

"Phyletic Transformation and the

Tertiary Fern Spike" is not going

anywhere.  I'll talk to Cuthbert and

put a stop to this right now.

FROCK

Please.  Don't humiliate me further.

MARGO

Let me help.  I can take care of

everything.

FROCK

No, Margo.  This is one problem you

can't solve.  You have to stay out of

it.  The fact is, I want to retire.

MARGO

How can you say that?  You know it's

not true.

FROCK

Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no

longer needed --

MARGO

My work on fossil intermediates

would be crippled without you.

FROCK

With all due respect, dear, that's

bull.  You dance rings around me with

your new technology.  You've left me

in the dust.

MARGO

(stubbornly loyal)

Your work is highly relevant.  What

about your display on Primitive

Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me

himself he was going to feature it

prominently in the Superstition

Exhibit.

FROCK

Healing plant use among the Ki tribe

of Bechuanaland has been cancelled

to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.

FROCK

Come on.  I'll walk you back to the

elevator.

MARGO

I'm not giving up.

FROCK

You must.

FROCK

This isn't a death sentence.  Greg

has promised to teach me fly

fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

MARGO

You are this museum.  It won't be the

same without you.

FROCK

Everyone needs a change of scenery.

I've been rolling down these halls

for forty-odd years.  That's quite

enough.

FROCK

I'll see you at lunch.

HENRY

Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go

and we still haven't seen the

dinosaurs!

BEASLEY

If you ask me about the dinosaurs

once more, I'II strangle you both!

LARRY

(whispers)

This room sucks.

HENRY

She's never going to take us to see

the dinosaurs.  That lady said they

were on the fourth floor.

LARRY

Let's ditch and find them ourselves.

LARRY

Look at this.  A Komodo dragon.

HENRY

Check out this one.  It can walk up

walls.

LARRY

We're not supposed to go back there.

HENRY

Chicken.  This is a great short cut.

LARRY

I don't want to go this way.

HENRY

Don't be a wuss.  Come on.

HENRY

Hey, there's a secret staircase back

here.  Cool.

LARRY

Henry, come back!

LARRY

Henry!  Henry!

LARRY

Henry?

LARRY

Henry!  Come up!  Please!

LARRY

Henry?  Where are you?  Henry?

LARRY

Henry!  Henry!  It smells awful.

Answer me!  Are you all right?

HENRY

Quiet!

LARRY

What is it?

HENRY

I don't know.  But I think it's bad.

D'AGOSTA

Don't touch anything until the

S.O.C.  has finished with those

stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the

perimeter.  I don't want any

contamination.  There's an incredible

amount of blood evidence down here.

We need more light.  Where's the

photographer?  Tell him to quit

eating donuts, I need him.

D'AGOSTA

Who are you?  The undertaker?

PENDERGAST

Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

D'AGOSTA

Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?

PENDERGAST

Not at all.  I think we may be

working on the same case.  If so, I

could use your help.

PENDERGAST

The body?

D'AGOSTA

What's left of it.

PENDERGAST

Mind if I have a look?

D'AGOSTA

We need light in here, stat.

PENDERGAST

Where's the head?

D'AGOSTA

Careful.  That mess on the ground is

brains.

PENDERGAST

Whose footprints?

Night watchman who found the body.

Sweet old man.  Been tossing his

D'AGOSTA

Woof.

PENDERGAST

Yes, I'd say we're definitely

working on the same case.

MARGO

Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back

there who'd been wading in blood.

MARGO (CON'T)

For once I'm glad you're rumor

central.  What in the world is going

on?

KAWAKITA

Someone's been murdered.  Not shot,

strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn

limb from limb.  There's talk of a

psychotic killer or even an animal.

FROCK

For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's

been killed.  Look, it's Cuthbert.

Let's hear what really happened.

CUTHBERT

This has been a tragic and upsetting

morning.  I have terrible news for us

all.  A member of our security force

has been found murdered.  The police

have just informed me it was Daniel

Beauregard.

(murmuring fills the room)

Quiet.  Please.  With the help of our

head of security, Mr. Ippolito... the

museum has been secured.

CUTHBERT

The police are satisfied we're in no

danger, that we're all perfectly

safe.  We've been asked to remain in

the Gem Room and be available for

questioning for the rest of the day.

Obviously, we will all do everything

we can to cooperate.  Are there any

questions?

IPPOLITO

The party for the opening of the

Superstition Exhibit... I imagine in

the light of what's happened it will

be pushed back.

CUTHBERT

No action has been taken yet.  The

opening of the exhibit is crucial to

the financial health of this museum.

So for now, we expect that the

Superstition Exhibit will open on

schedule, tomorrow night.

MARGO

That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work.

Someone's dead and all he cares

about is his Superstition Exhibit.

FROCK

Cuthbert's counting on the

exhibition's success.  The museum is

in debt.  Contributions and public

funding have dried up.  Admissions no

longer cover overhead.  The last big

infusion of cash we had was the King

Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to

get us out of the red.  If the

Superstition Exhibit isn't

lucrative, he'll have to start

auctioning off some of these gems.

KAWAKITA

With all this bad publicity, it's no

wonder he looks like that.

FROCK

Ian.  Are you okay?

CUTHBERT

(shakes his head)

Beauregard.  I can't believe it.  I

may have been the last one to see

him alive.  He was with me just

yesterday, when I got out the statue

of Mbwun.

MARGO

(taken aback)

Mbwun.

KAWAKITA

(sensing more gossip)

What's that?

MARGO

Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an

extinct South American tribe.  Dr.

John Whittlesley led an expedition

that found the only known

representation of Mbwun.  The statue

is said to carry a curse.

(she looks away, quiet)

Every member of Whittlesley's

expedition died.

CUTHBERT

I got the relic out yesterday to put

on display.  Beauregard was there.

The crates had been broken into and

the contents were strewn about.  But

nothing was missing.  It was

downright weird.  We joked that it

was the curse of Mbwun.  I'm not

laughing now.

FROCK

Come, Ian.  We all know you're

superstitious.  But you're among

scientists here.  We deal in facts.

That statue had nothing to do with

what happened to Beauregard.

CUTHBERT

All I know is, everyone who has come

in contact with that relic, is dead.

D'AGOSTA

(mutters)

Get a life.

PENDERGAST

An original Roger Tory Peterson of a

Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I

have a copy of this in my office at

home.

D'AGOSTA

Can't really focus on birds at the

moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to

keep my breakfast down.

PENDERGAST

In this violent world, I believe the

only way to stay sane is to take

time to notice beautiful things.

D'AGOSTA

I drink.  After hours of course.  On

duty, I smoke.

(he pulls out a fat cigar)

Do you mind?

PENDERGAST

Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a

good cigar.

D'AGOSTA

Then you won't like this one.  It's a

piece of shit.

PENDERGAST

Lieutenant --

D'AGOSTA

Call me Vince.

PENDERGAST

Did you read about a boat that

washed up outside of New Orleans

about four months ago?  Twelve bodies

on board.

D'AGOSTA

Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil,

wasn't it?

PENDERGAST

Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours.

All the corpses were badly mutilated

in a very particular way.

Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs

torn to shreds.  It looked like the

work of a large animal, but there

was no sign of an animal on board.

D'AGOSTA

So the method of death is the only

connection?

PENDERGAST

No.  There's more.  There were crates

from this museum in the hold of the

boat.

BAILEY

Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.

D'AGOSTA

It better be good.

BAILEY

There are a couple of kids who were

lost yesterday near the site of the

murder.  Claimed they saw a monster.

They're pretty determined to tell

you their story.  You want to see

them?

D'AGOSTA

(rolls his eyes)

No.

PENDERGAST

If you don't mind, this could be

important.

D'AGOSTA

You're kidding.

PENDERGAST

Unfortunately, no.

D'AGOSTA

Hi.  I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.  You can

call me Vince.  This is Special Agent

Pendergast.  You can call him...

(he looks to Pendergast, so formal)

Special Agent Pendergast.

BEASLEY

This is Henry Weiss and Larry

Bowers.

D'AGOSTA

So... Tell us about this monster.

LARRY

We were lost and trying to find a

short cut to the dino--

HENRY

We were just lost, okay?  And we went

down this curvy staircase.  At the

bottom was a big shadow.

LARRY

Big as a house.

HENRY

Not that big.

LARRY

Well almost.  Depends which house.  It

smelled like old hamburger, and it

made this weird noise.

LARRY

And it snuffled the ground like a

dog.

HENRY

Like this.

LARRY

It had a long tongue, teeth this big

and yellow eyes.

HENRY

They were green eyes and they were

slit like a lizard's.

LARRY

They were yellow!

HENRY

You're color blind.

BEASLEY

Boys, please!

(to D'Agosta)

These two get in a lot of mischief

and they tell some amazing whoppers.

D'AGOSTA

I can see that.

HENRY

This isn't a whopper!  It's the

truth.

PENDERGAST

How did you get away?

HENRY

We ran and screamed and stuff.  And

we got through a little door just in

time.  There was a guard there and he

went back to check.

PENDERGAST

A guard?  Do you remember his name?

LARRY

He was wearing one of those I.D.

badges.  His name was Bo... something.

D'AGOSTA

Beauregard?

LARRY

Yeah.

D'AGOSTA

I've got to admit, that was a damn

sight better than "the dog ate my

homework".

PENDERGAST

How do you explain the part about

Beauregard?

D'AGOSTA

They heard the victim's name and

wove him into their story.  Nice

touch.

PENDERGAST

I believed them.

D'AGOSTA

You think what we've got here is a

monster as big as a house that

smells... like hamburger?

PENDERGAST

No.  I think what we've got here is a

psychotic killer wielding some kind

of unusual weapon... who wants us to

believe he's a monster.

D'AGOSTA

(totally confused)

Oh.

DR. ZIEWZIC

You're late, Vince.

D'AGOSTA

Sorry Dr. Ziewzic.  This is Special

Agent Pendergast.  Pendergast, Dr.

Ziewzic.  She runs the best chop shop

in New York.

PENDERGAST

We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.

DR. ZIEWZIC

Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards

you sent me that amazing case of

Chateau Lafitte.

PENDERGAST

I hope you liked it.

DR. ZIEWZIC

Lovely bouquet.  After our last case,

Vince took me out for a draft beer.

As I recall we split the check.

D'AGOSTA

(grumbles)

It's been one of those days.

DR. ZIEWZIC

(she snaps her rubber glove)

Shall we get down to it, then?

DR. ZIEWZIC

(for the microphone)

This is Dr. Matilda Ziewzic,

assisted by Dr. Frederick Gross.

It's Oct. 28, six fifteen p.m.  We

are joined by Lieutenant Vincent

D'Agosta of the NYPD, Special Agent

Pendergast of the FBI and a police

photographer.  Let's see what we've

got.

DR. ZIEWZIC

Caucasian male.  Age about 27.  Blond.

Height well I can't give a height

because Mr. Beauregard has been

decapitated.  The state of the body

is such that other identifying marks

are out of the question.  There are

numerous lacerations proceeding from

the left anterior pectoral downwards

through the sternum and terminating

in the abdomen.  This is a massive

wound, two feet long and a foot

wide.  The head has suffered severe

trauma and the occipital portion of

the calavarium has been crushed and

removed.  It almost looks like...

DR. GROSS

(beat)

A bite.

DR. ZIEWZIC

What are we talking about here?

PENDERGAST

Someone who makes the Hacksaw

Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

DR. ZIEWZIC

Right.

(back to work)

The entire brain appears to have

been extracted.  May I see it,

please?

DR. ZIEWZIC

Curious.  There's something missing.

PENDERGAST

The thalamus and the hypothalamus,

perhaps?

DR. ZIEWZIC

(looks up, surprised)

Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut

have been removed with what looks

like surgical precision.

D'AGOSTA

What happened to them?

PENDERGAST

If you don't mind a suggestion, you

might try a saliva test.

D'AGOSTA

(incredulous)

Saliva test?  You mean, you think

someone ate part of the brain?

PENDERGAST

Correct.

DR. ZWIEZIC

Okay.  One saliva test.  Now... let's

look at these lacerations.  They

start wide and then converge.

D'AGOSTA

Long fingernails?  Scratches?

DR. ZWIEZIC

Too extreme.  Perhaps some kind of

weapon.  I'm now probing the wound

and... there's a piece of foreign

material deep in the muscle, lodged

on a rib.  Photograph.

D'AGOSTA

Sweet Jesus.

DR. ZWIEZIC

It's a claw.

DISSOLVE TO:

D'AGOSTA

I don't like animals.  Never have.

Dog bit me when I was little.  After

that I gave up on pets.  Animals are

irrational.  Give me a psychotic

killer any day.  If there's one thing

that makes me queasy it's being part

of a food chain.  My first case as a

rookie, two brothers climbed a fence

at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over

ninety.  The polar bear was inside

his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in

there.  All they saw was the pool.

They got to swimming and splashing.

The noise woke up the bear.  By the

time I arrived, both little boys

were in pieces.  The bear was

dragging one kid around by the foot.

I can still hear the mother

screaming --

PENDERGAST

This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've

been on this case four months,

remember?  I've learned a few things.

D'AGOSTA

You've been holding out on me

Pendergast.  You have a suspect

capable of this?

PENDERGAST

Let me tell you about it, Vince.

PENDERGAST

Excuse me.  Has Dr. Green left?

KAWAKITA

Before eight?  You must be joking.

She's in the physical anthro lab

making up for lost time.

PENDERGAST

Dr. Green?

MARGO (OS)

You have a warrant to look at that?

PENDERGAST

Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping.

What is this?

MARGO

An invention of mine.  It's a

computer program designed to

describe the characteristics of a

given species from a reading of its

DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence

Extrapolator.

PENDERGAST

How does it work?

MARGO

With a DNA analysis from a fossil

you can use this program to tell the

species and sex of the animal,

whether it was nocturnal, what it

ate, how it hunted, how big it

was...

(abrupt)

You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.

PENDERGAST

No.

(a moment)

I came to talk about Dr. John

Whittlesley.

MARGO

Somehow, when all this happened... I

knew it would come back to John.  Is

he really dead?

PENDERGAST

Maybe not.

MARGO

If he were alive he'd have contacted

me.

PENDERGAST

You have time to talk?

PENDERGAST

Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in

Belem, Venezuela a week after the

rest of his expedition disappeared.

A taxi driver drove him to the

harbor where he boarded a cargo

boat.  That boat washed up in my

district.  Everyone on board was

killed.

MARGO

And John?

PENDERGAST

Disappeared.  His body wasn't among

the victims.

MARGO

I don't understand.

PENDERGAST

The people killed were mauled and

their brains were eaten.  Just like

Beauregard.  One part of the brain

was extracted with surgical

precision.  The hypothalamus and

thalamus to be exact.

MARGO

John couldn't have anything to do

with a horrible thing like that.  He

was a fine man despite his

problems --

PENDERGAST

You loved him.

MARGO

(a moment, taken aback)

Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John

held the Cadwalader Chair in

Statistical Paleontology when I was

a grad student there.

PENDERGAST

You were going to be married.

MARGO

How did you know that?

PENDERGAST

I ran an internet search on Dr.

Whittlesley.  Got a list of his

scholarly articles and the

engagement announcement in the

Times.  I also found a record of your

restraining order.

MARGO

That was two years ago.  John was

still in love with me.

(she looks down)

He wouldn't leave me alone.

PENDERGAST

You were afraid of him, weren't you?

MARGO

He was afraid of himself.  He tried

suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic

depressive.  He had wild emotional

highs and lows.  Not a happy

affliction for a scientist.  He'd

been revered in our community.  By

the end he was a joke.

PENDERGAST

Tell me about the last expedition.

What was he looking for?

MARGO

A legendary monster called Mbwun.

PENDERGAST

A monster?

MARGO

Yes.  He developed his own theory

that he called the Calisto Effect.

It held that evolution wasn't always

gradual or driven by natural

selection.  The environment would

sometimes cause sudden and grotesque

changes which could result in a

"monster species".  It made no sense.

But he felt he had evidence that

Mbwun was such a monster, living in

isolation on the tepui for thousands

of years.

PENDERGAST

What happened?

MARGO

No one knows.  The Kothoga who live

on the tepui are cannibals.

MARGO

No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this

affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get

help.  His ego endangered the lives

of others.  His theory came first.

PENDERGAST

What if Whittlesley arrived on the

tepui and no monster was there?  Was

he desperate enough to create one?

MARGO

I don't understand.

PENDERGAST

Something came up in autopsy

tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's

body we found a claw.

MARGO

My God.  Then it was an animal.

PENDERGAST

I don't think so.  I think we were

meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did

Whittlesley's monster have claws?

MARGO

I don't know.  He sent back a statue

that's supposed to be an exact

representation.  But I've never seen

it.  It's in the exhibit.

PENDERGAST

Would you mind showing it to me?

PENDERGAST

Where would we find it?

MARGO

I'm not sure.  We should split up.

You take that hall and I'll take

this one.

PENDERGAST

All right.  I'm as macho as you are.

Perhaps.

MBWUN

Savage God of the Kothoga, also

known as "HE WHO WALKS ON ALL

FOURS".

MARGO

Mr. Pendergast!  I found it.

MARGO

Pendergast!  Over here --

MARGO

What the...

MARGO

Pendergast?

(no answer)

Who's there?

PENDERGAST

Dr. Green!  Dr. Green!

DISSOLVE TO:

PENDERGAST

What happened?

MARGO

I don't know.

PENDERGAST

I heard you calling and I ran after

you, but you kept disappearing and I

couldn't keep up.

MARGO

(she touches her forehead)

You were behind me?  Running after

me?

MARGO

It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember

now... It was an animal.  Something

large!  I could smell it.  It was

hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in

the dark.

PENDERGAST

Where did you see it?

MARGO

Behind me.  Over there.

MARGO

That's not what I saw.

PENDERGAST

All right.  If you're positive.

MARGO (CON'T)

I can't think straight at the

moment.  I know how crazy this seems.

Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some

fresh air.  Could you get me out of

here?

PENDERGAST

Stay in formation together.  Take it

room by room.  Check for footprints,

any signs of disturbance.  If you see

or hear anything the least bit

suspicious, I want to know.

PENDERGAST

Bailey's going to be in the guard

house outside.  Officer Van Dorn is

right down that hall.  When McNitt's

done, he'll relieve you.

PENDERGAST

Dr. Green...

MARGO

I didn't imagine it.  I know what I

saw.  Are you sure there are enough

men in there?

PENDERGAST

They're all heavily armed.

MARGO

(stops)

All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm

a scientist.  I like order and logic.

Sometimes too much.  There's got to

be an explanation.  There can't be an

animal in there.  But I saw

something.

PENDERGAST

What was it?

MARGO

I don't know.

(she has a thought)

Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get

me a DNA readout on that claw.

DISSOLVE TO:

DOYLE

Bailey?  Doyle here.  I'm still

waiting outside the exhibit.  Where

the hell is McNitt?

BAILEY

Should be there any minute.  They

came out a side door a while ago.

Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's

headed back to spell you.

DOYLE

I'm on double over-time, man.

BAILEY

I know.  You can go home if you want

to.  I'll come relieve you myself.

DOYLE

What the hell.

DOYLE

McNitt?

DOYLE

McNitt?  Cut the crap.  I know it's

you.  You're not scaring me.  Come on.

MCNITT

McNitt here.  I'm outside the

exhibit.  All's quiet.  But I don't

see Doyle.

BAILEY (OS)

He called a minute ago looking for

you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and

he wanted out.  I said you were on

the way.  He could split.

MCNITT

Well he's gone.

BAILEY (OS)

Any sign of a green-eyed monster?

MCNITT

(chuckles)

Nope.

DISSOLVE TO:

PENDERGAST

I had no idea the Museum had a

complete collection of Piranesi's

Forum sketches.

CUTHBERT

If you like them, they're for sale.

Another day like yesterday and half

the collection will be on the block.

PENDERGAST

I've read about the Museum's

financial troubles.

CUTHBERT

We've been operating in the red for

years.  That was the whole idea

behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It

was designed to pull people in.

We've spent every penny we have on

advance publicity, betting

everything on the opening's success.

If we postpone at the last minute...

No.  I don't want to think about

that.

D'AGOSTA

(chews on his toothpick, mild)

We all love the museum.  I come here

myself with my kids.  We're trying to

work with you.

CUTHBERT

I appreciate that.

PENDERGAST

If the party goes forward, and

that's a big if... I've arranged for

a large police presence.

CUTHBERT

Do they have to wear uniforms?

PENDERGAST

Yes.

CUTHBERT

I don't want to scare people.

PENDERGAST

I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert,

we've got bigger problems.  Depending

on what we find today, we may have

to shut you down.

KAWAKITA

What do you make of it, Margo?

MARGO

It's not mammalian, that's for sure.

I think it's reptilian.

PENDERGAST

That would jive with what we got

from the preliminary DNA read-out.

Here, have a look.

MARGO

According to this, twenty-five

percent of the claw DNA is

unidentifiable, about a third is

homo sapien, and the rest is

Hemidactylus Turcicus.

D'AGOSTA

(looks over)

What's that?

MARGO

Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.

KAWAKITA

Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same

strand?  Impossible.  The sample must

be contaminated.

MARGO

There's another possibility.  A lot

of repeated base pairs could suggest

a high level of genetic damage.

PENDERGAST

Genetic damage?

MARGO

When DNA is defective, it often

uncontrollably replicates long

repeating sequences of the same base

pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can

radiation, certain chemicals.  Even

cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it

out.  I have to get started.  This

will take several hours.

PENDERGAST

We need someone to take us to the

secure storage area.

KAWAKITA

Try Dr. Frock.  He's the curator of

Plant Biology.  All the curators

have keys.  And he knows every inch

of this museum.  The rest of us still

get lost.

PENDERGAST

Thank you for taking the time to

help us with this, Dr. Frock.

FROCK

Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough

these days.  According to security,

Beauregard put the Whittlesley

crates in storage area 1012.

PENDERGAST

How many storage areas are there?

FROCK

They fill seven floors.  We have the

largest collection of mammals and

dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give

you an idea, there are more than

three million insects specimens.  Not

to mention amphibians, reptiles,

birds, anthropological artifacts,

meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only

about five percent of the museum

collection is actually on display.

D'AGOSTA

This place is a maze.

FROCK

I'm one of the few who know every

inch it, now that John is gone.

PENDERGAST

(looks over)

Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?

FROCK

Yes.  John made quite a study of the

whole museum.  He had a copy of my

original plans.

MARGO

Osteo prep, Karl.

D'AGOSTA

My kind of art.

KARL

They keep me company.  Gets kinda

lonely sometimes.

D'AGOSTA

My favorite is the two camels.

KARL

Really?  I'm partial to the skunks.

FROCK

Did you ever wonder where we get all

our skeletons?  This is the

laboratory where animal carcasses

are reduced to bones.

(to Osterbaan)

What's cooking today, Don?

DON

Zebra.

D'AGOSTA

Man, that's ripe.

FROCK

Dermestid beetles.  The second method

of preparing a skeleton, used in

Natural History Museums world wide.

Bugs are clean and highly efficient.

They'll polish that fox off in no

time.

OSTERBAAN

Want to have a look at a gorilla

brain?  Got one right here.

FROCK

Thanks Don.  We're in a hurry.  Some

other time.

FROCK

This should be it.  Can you read the

number?

D'AGOSTA

Holy shit.

FROCK

Something tried to get into this

room!

PENDERGAST

And failed.  These doors are solid

steel.

FROCK

This means there must be an animal

loose in the museum!

PENDERGAST

I wouldn't be so sure.

PENDERGAST

This must be the one that held the

statue.  Let's see what else is

inside.

D'AGOSTA

The lid of this crate is scratched

with claw marks, just like the door.

TWO

ARROWS, one silver overlaid with another of GOLD

.

D'AGOSTA

Look.  It's some kind of letter.

FROCK

(excited)

May I see that?

FROCK

It's from John.  Those two arrows

were his insignia.  It's addressed to

Louis Moriarty, a patron who

financed his expeditions.

PENDERGAST

Read it out loud.

FROCK

"Dear Louis,

Tomorrow we go to the south

end of the tepui where we'll be in

the greatest danger, so I'm sending

Carlos back with the crates.  You

always believed in me, Louis, even

in the darkest days.  So it gives me

great pleasure to tell you your

faith has been rewarded.  We've made

an incredible find.  I enclose a

representation of Mbwun.  Note the

exaggerated claws, the reptilian

attributes, the hints of bipedalia.

It's beyond belief, but this statue

is accurate.  I know because I've

seen the beast."

FROCK

Did you hear that?  My God.  He says

that Mbwun is real!

D'AGOSTA

(snorts)

Pardon my French, but bull shit.

FROCK

This on top of the scratches... isn't

it proof!

PENDERGAST

I think the scratches were put there

to scare us.  Perhaps even lead us to

this note.

PENDERGAST

You said John Whittlesley made a

study of your blueprints of the

museum.

FROCK

Yes.

PENDERGAST

Are there any hidden rooms or

staircases?  Places where someone

could hide?

FROCK

Not really.  Just the sub-basement.

PENDERGAST

Where is that?

FROCK

I don't know.  It was walled over.  No

one's been down there in years.

PENDERGAST

You said you had plans of the

museum.  Could we see them, please?

FROCK

I know they're here somewhere.  It's

a good thing we caught the movers in

time.  They're nineteen century

blueprints from when the museum was

built.  I remember the sub-basement

was below the regular basement,

linked to the city sewer.  I only

know about it because it flooded all

the way up to the museum during the

hurricane of '49.  I lost so many

precious books.

FROCK

Eureka.  Who says it doesn't pay to

be a pack rat?  Now please be careful

with these.  When you're done, I'd

like them back.

D'AGOSTA

How big is the sub-basement?

PENDERGAST

Apparently it's huge.

D'AGOSTA

I think I should come with you.

PENDERGAST

We haven't got time.  You have to

meet with museum security so we can

make a decision about tonight.

PENDERGAST

These plans indicate there's a

walled over entrance to the sub-

basement right around here.

JONATHAN

The dogs are picking up something,

Mr. Pendergast.

DEPUTY ONE

What is this?  A dungeon?

IPPOLITO

This huge police presence tonight

isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll

just scare people off.  I can handle

the security behind scenes with this

system.  It's state of the art.

D'AGOSTA

The cops are non-negotiable,

Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me

how this space station works.

IPPOLITO

It's fool proof, basically.  I

designed this whole thing myself.

Every valuable object in the Museum

carries a small electronic chip.  If

anything's moved so much as an inch,

we get an alarm pinpointing the

exact location of the attempted

theft.

D'AGOSTA

That's great if you're stopping a

burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are

there motion detectors?

IPPOLITO

In every exhibition room.  The

museum's divided into five cells.

The reception and exhibit are in

cell five.  We could arm the motion

detectors in cells one to four, then

seal the perimeter with our fire

doors.

D'AGOSTA

That would leave one exit for

hundreds of people.  You'd be

violating every fire regulation on

the books.  We'll guard the perimeter

with my men and engage the motion

detectors in the other cells.  One

more question.  I see a big hole.  If

this entire thing is run by

computer, what happens if the power

fails?

IPPOLITO

(snorts)

You don't know much about computers,

Lieutenant.  There are safeguards

built in.  We have back-up systems

with redundancies.  There's no way

these computers can fail.

FROCK

I can't help thinking there's

something that Pendergast

overlooked.  If the scratches were

made by whatever killed Beauregard,

it wants something that's in here.

MARGO

A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant

press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.

FROCK

Let me see the plant press.

MARGO

What is it?

FROCK

I'm not sure.  As you know, the

Kothoga lived outside civilization

on the tepui for thousands of years.

Species flourished in isolation when

man and pollution rendered them

extinct.  This could be one of the

last remaining samples of an unknown

plant.

MARGO

Whatever it is, it must be common on

the tepui.  John used it as packing

material.

FROCK

You're right.

FROCK

They're curiously fleshy.

KAWAKITA

And they smell delicious.

KAWAKITA

Taste great.

FROCK

I wouldn't put that in your mouth

until we do a chemical analysis,

Greg.

KAWAKITA

I can handle that for you while

we're waiting on the G.S.E.

MARGO

What about those seed pods?  Are they

from the same plant?

FROCK

Margo, these aren't seed pods.

MARGO

What are they?

FROCK

They're eggs.

PENDERGAST

Hard to read in this light.  The ink

is so faded.

JONATHAN

The dogs have lost the scent, Mr.

Pendergast.  Maybe we should head

back.

PENDERGAST

Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the

left.

DEPUTY TWO

This place gives me the creeps.

JONATHAN

They've got something.

PENDERGAST

Keep the light up.  I can't see.

PENDERGAST

Shut them up!

JONATHAN

Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!

JONATHAN

They're going crazy!  I need help!

JONATHAN

He's loose!  Argo!

PENDERGAST

Stop!

JONATHAN

Holy mother, what is that?

DEPUTY ONE

Smells God-awful.  Like rotten meat.

JONATHAN

Argo!  Come!

PENDERGAST

Quiet!

JONATHAN

No!  Hobbes!

PENDERGAST

Forget the dogs.  You two, get back

here.  Don't point that gun at me.

JONATHAN

Argo!  Hobbes!

PENDERGAST

Get back!  Now!

JONATHAN

You shot my dog!

JONATHAN

My dog...

DEPUTY ONE

(stammers)

He was coming right at me...

DEPUTY TWO

Let's get out of here!

JONATHAN

I'm not going anywhere!  Not without

my dog!

JONATHAN

Hobbes!

DEPUTY ONE

Get back!

JONATHAN

There's something out there!  Let's

go get it now!  That's why we came

down here, isn't it?

PENDERGAST

(to the deputies)

He's right.  Follow me.

DEPUTY ONE

No way.  I say we get help.  A lot

more guns.

PENDERGAST

I'm ordering you!  Cover me!

DEPUTY TWO

We'll cover you from here!

JONATHAN

Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.

PENDERGAST

Come on.  Let's get back to the

others.  We can't leave them alone.

JONATHAN

It's alright.  I can tell by the way

the dog's acting that whatever was

out there is gone.  What is this

place?

PENDERGAST

Not on the map.  Looks like it

connects with the city sewer.

PENDERGAST

We're coming back!

PENDERGAST

Identify yourself!  Who's there?

JONATHAN

Oh... my... God!

PENDERGAST

(hisses)

Quiet.

PENDERGAST

Stay calm.

D'AGOSTA

I'm telling you, something's wrong.

I still haven't heard from

Pendergast.  I think you should call

it off.

CUTHBERT

It's too late now.  Guests are

arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling

up.

D'AGOSTA

I'll go down and speak to him.

CUTHBERT

(irritated)

You haven't got the authority.  Only

Pendergast can pull the plug.

D'AGOSTA

Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't

you understand?  He still hasn't come

back.  It's been over three hours --

CUTHBERT

He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good

shape.  Your security is air tight.

There've been no more incidents,

nothing suspicious.  There's no

reason to call off the opening now.

KAWAKITA

What kind of egg is it?

MARGO

It's reptilian.

FROCK

Like the claw.

MARGO

(cautious)

Let's not jump to conclusions.  This

egg could belong to any number of

reptiles, Dr. Frock.

FROCK

(excited)

Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge

of something huge.  Let's consider

the possibility, just the three of

us, alone in this room.  What if John

was right.  I mean, what if?  And he

sent back an egg of his monster in

the crates.  When it got to the

museum, it hatched.

MARGO

Several problems with that theory.

For one thing, this egg is intact.

For another, according to

Pendergast, the crates were shipped

here on a boat.  Everyone on board

was killed like Beauregard.  If the

thing hatched in mid-ocean, where

did it go?

KAWAKITA

I guess you're not interested in

this plant anymore, but the chemical

analysis is done.  Frock reads the

computer over Greg's shoulder.

FROCK

"Genus: Unknown.  Family: Unknown.

Order: Unknown.  Phylum: Unknown.

Cripes, Margo, what did you give me?

Is this an animal or one funky

shrub?"

(to Kawakita)

I see you've been programming the

computer vocabulary again.

MARGO

(points to a hexagonal symbol)

Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus

protein.  That explains why the

computer's confused.  The plant's

infected with a virus.

FROCK

That's not so unusual.  Many plants

carry viruses.  Like the burls on

Maple trees.

MARGO

But a virus normally codes for other

viruses.  This one's making human and

animal proteins.  Listen to this.

(reads)

"Glycotetraglycine collagenoid.

Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4-

monoxytocin supressin hormone."

KAWAKITA

These plant fibers are loaded with

hormones!

MARGO

What kind of hormones?

KAWAKITA

4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone

secreted by the human hypothalamus

gland."

MARGO

Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.

FROCK

A hormone secreted by the human

thalamus gland.

MARGO

This is it.  This is what he, or

it... is after!  The plant has high

concentrations of the same hormones

found in minute quantities in the

human brain!

KAWAKITA

So what?

MARGO

Pendergast told me the killer

extracts and eats the hypothalamus

and thalamus of the victim's brains!

KAWAKITA

(pales)

Eats them?

MARGO

Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may

have lived on this plant.  When the

crates were put in secure storage,

they were out of reach.  The killer

couldn't get them, so it got the

next best thing.

FROCK

Beauregard's head.

MARGO

It's all right.  That means the

G.S.E.  has finished analyzing the

claw DNA.  Greg, you go find

Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta

now.

DRUNK

Hey, where 'za little boys room?

KAWAKITA

Down that hallway.  But don't stay

long.  You don't want to be here

alone.

MARGO

All right, assuming the program is

accurate, this is a description of

the animal with that claw.

(she reads)

"Species unidentified.  Genus:

unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male,

weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain

capacity, 900 centimeters." That

means it's highly intelligent.

"Quadrupedal."

FROCK

Quadrupedal!  The other name for

Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."

MARGO

"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony

plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70

kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"...

poor eyesight.  "External mucoid

nasal glands,"... very keen scent...

"Morphological characteristics:

Highly robust.  Aggressiveness:

extreme."

FROCK

So the claw came from a huge

creature with a preternatural sense

of smell and poor eyesight that

hunts at night.

MARGO

With the intelligence of a human

being, the speed of a greyhound, and

the strength of a grizzly bear.

FROCK

(a long moment)

Margo, what you've just described is

a killing machine.

MARGO

And it's hungry.  It's been two days

since it's eaten.  There are five

hundred people arriving right now.

The animal hunts at night and it has

a keen sense of smell!  All those

people in one enclosed space...

FROCK

It's like ringing the dinner bell.

CUTHBERT

Thank you everyone and welcome.

We're glad all of you were willing

to brave the inclement weather to be

with us tonight.  Our special thanks

to his honor, the mayor and his

lovely wife.

CUTHBERT (CON'T)

Some people have questioned whether

a superstition exhibit belongs in a

Museum of Science.  Spells,

incantations, demons, magic... these

are forces that defy the natural

laws.  Superstition provides answers

to the great questions based on

fear.  Science provides answers to

the great questions based on truth.

Science and superstition, then, are

polar opposites.  Mortal enemies, if

you will.  And that is why we are

here tonight.  We have come to learn

more about the enemy, and thus to

bring about its defeat.  For every

good, there is an evil, for every

dark, a light.  And so tonight... my

friends, I give you ignorance,

terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil.

(smiles, gestures to the exhibit)

Have a great time.

KAWAKITA

Lieutenant!  It's me.

D'AGOSTA

What is it?

KAWAKITA

Dr. Green has to see you!

D'AGOSTA

Got my hands full here.

KAWAKITA

It's important.  Please.  You have to

come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found

out something.

D'AGOSTA

McNitt?  D'Agosta here.

MCNITT

Yeah Lieutenant?  I'm here.

D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)

I'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio

labs.  Any sign of Pendergast?

MCNITT

Not yet.

MCNITT

Hold on Lieutenant.

(to George)

What was that?

GEORGE

Probably just something wrong with

the air conditioning.  There's a shit

load of electrical rooms back there.

MCNITT

Lieutenant?  There's something wrong

in the computer room.

D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)

Goddamn it.  I'll get Ippolito and

send him up.

GEORGE

You're over-reacting.  Sounds like

the air conditioning to me.

D'AGOSTA

Damn.  There's some kind of problem

in the computer room.  I have to go

get Ippolito.  You wait here.

CUTHBERT

Here we have a very rare sacrificial

table from Mesoamerica.  The priests

would kill the victim on this slab,

cut out the heart and eat it while

it was still beating.

MAYOR

I could use one of these things in

City Hall.

MAYOR'S WIFE

You're letting kids see this?  I

should think they'd have nightmares.

CUTHBERT

Kid will love it.  They're our target

audience.  Nothing here is as violent

as what they see on T.V.

MAYOR

I don't know.  That could be a little

over the top.  It's not even

scientific.  Mummies don't bleed.

CUTHBERT

Oh... my... God...

IPPOLITO

Quiet everyone!

WOMAN

There's a body up there!

MCNITT

George!  Get out here, now!

MCNITT

George!  Where are you?

MCNITT

Hey you?  George!  Damn it.  Where are

you?  No response.

MCNITT

George!  We've got an emergency!  Are

you here?

MCNITT

Oh God.  Oh God!

MCNITT

George!  I saw something in there!  I

fired but I think I missed it!

MCNITT

George, for Chrissake answer me!

KAWAKITA

What happened?!

D'AGOSTA

There's a dead body in the exhibit!

People are panicking, trampling each

other trying to get out.

D'AGOSTA

What the hell is going on?!

IPPOLITO

The whole system is shutting down!

We have to get out quickly before

the fire doors fall!

D'AGOSTA

What doors?

IPPOLITO

I told you!  They seal off all the

cells.  They were designed to fall

automatically in a system failure --

D'AGOSTA

You said the system couldn't fail!

BAILEY

Above you!  Look out!

D'AGOSTA

Ippolito!  Get back here!

IPPOLITO

Like hell!

MARGO

What's going on?

FROCK

Some kind of power failure.  Maybe

it's the storm.  Do you have a

flashlight?

MARGO

I think so.

FROCK

Greg's been gone over a half hour.

We'd better get out of here.  Get the

crate.

MARGO

Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?

FROCK

Don't stop now.

MARGO

What's that?

FROCK

It's one of the fire doors.  Good

Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!

PENDERGAST

I know where we are now.  We're

getting out, Jonathan.  This should

be another door.

JONATHAN

Hallelujah, Pendergast.  Where the

hell are we now?

JONATHAN

Jesus, what is this?

PENDERGAST

Another storage room.

PENDERGAST

Something's happened.  The power's

out.

PENDERGAST

All right.  I know where we are.  This

is the osteo prep lab.  I was in here

earlier.  We're safe now.

JONATHAN

Oh no.  I smell it.

PENDERGAST

Keep the animal quiet.

PENDERGAST

Go out the other doorway.  There's a

stair at the end of the hall.  Up

five flights is a corridor that

leads to the Hall of the Heavens.

Find Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Bring

help.

PENDERGAST

Halt!

PENDERGAST

Margo!  Frock!  It's coming!  Run!

FROCK

Look!

MARGO

Dr. Frock!  Quick!

MARGO (OS)

Pendergast?  Are you all right?

PENDERGAST

No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

MARGO

You're not.  Where is it?

PENDERGAST

(shakes his head)

Gone.

MARGO

Wounded?

PENDERGAST

No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45

caliber bullet bounced off that

thing's skull like a spit ball.  I

think it was bothered by my light.

MARGO

That would fit.  It's nocturnal.

Quick.  Come inside.

D'AGOSTA ON RADIO

Ippolito!  Where the hell are you?

We're trapped in here!  We need help!

Ippolito!  Come in, dammit!

BAILEY

Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm

getting nothing, Lieutenant.

D'AGOSTA

Great.

FRANK

There's no power.  The whole system's

down.

MAN

We're trapped!  And there's a killer

in here!

D'AGOSTA

We'll get out safely if everyone

stays calm.  Is anyone else hurt?

MAYOR

Yes.  My wife.

D'AGOSTA

Is there a doctor?

POUND

I'm Dr. Pound.

D'AGOSTA

Check this woman and see if anyone

else needs you.

JONATHAN

(calls)

Lieutenant D'Agosta!  Don't shoot.

D'AGOSTA

Where's Pendergast?

JONATHAN

(crossing, breathless)

Five flights down.  We were lost in

the sub-basement.  Something's down

there.  It killed our two deputies.

When I left Pendergast it was coming

back.  He sent me for help.  We have

to hurry.

D'AGOSTA

Both of you.  Get back here.

POUND

But he's still alive --

D'AGOSTA

Get back now!

CUTHBERT

What's going on?

D'AGOSTA

There's some kind of animal loose in

the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He

needs help.  I want volunteers to go

with me.

BAILEY

I'm in.

KAWAKITA

(swallows)

Me too.

CUTHBERT

(voice rising in fear)

I'd do it gladly but someone needs

to stay with these people.

D'AGOSTA

All right.  You're elected.  Bailey,

get all the guns and flashlights,

give the mayor your walkie talkie so

we can keep in touch.  Cuthbert, keep

everyone together and make sure they

stay quiet.

FRANK

I was in the Marines.  Give me a gun.

I'd go with you, too, but I've got

my daughter.

D'AGOSTA

What's your name?

FRANK

Frank.

D'AGOSTA

All right.  You guard these people

and your daughter.

MAYOR'S WIFE

(to D'Agosta)

Where are you going?  Don't leave us

alone!

MAYOR

Everyone quiet.  The Lieutenant's in

charge.

D'AGOSTA

Bailey, we'll go first and check the

stairwell.  Jonathan, you and Greg

guard the door.

KAWAKITA

Excuse me.  Could you tell me how

this thing works?

JONATHAN

Oh Jesus.  Don't point it at me.  Just

aim and shoot.

D'AGOSTA

(low)

Hold on.  I thought I saw something.

D'AGOSTA

Whoa... You smell that?

JONATHAN

Lieutenant!  Get back!

D'AGOSTA

BAILEY!!!

BAILEY

NOOOOO!

D'AGOSTA

Jonathan!  Don't let it get into the

hall!

D'AGOSTA

(yells)

Where is it?!

JONATHAN

I don't know!  It hit me hard.

D'AGOSTA

(screams)

Somebody tell me!  Where is it now?

MAYOR

(quiet)

Lieutenant.  In the south corner.

D'AGOSTA

On three.

D'AGOSTA

One, two... three.

D'AGOSTA

Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me!

CUTHBERT

It went out the door to the rotunda!

D'AGOSTA

Get everyone into the stairwell!

CUTHBERT

Sweet Jesus!

D'AGOSTA

Get his gun and his walkie talkie,

Jonathan.  Move.

CUTHBERT

My office is on the third floor!

There's a walk-in safe and a

portable phone!  We can lock

ourselves in the safe and call for

help!

D'AGOSTA

I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita

and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest

of you can go with Cuthbert!

MAYOR

I think we should stick together!

FRANK

(taking Bailey's shotgun)

Me too.

CUTHBERT

I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come

with me.

D'AGOSTA

Wait!

D'AGOSTA

Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't

armed.

MAYOR

Good luck!

IPPOLITO

All right everyone.  I'm in charge.

Status report.

WATERS

Swat teams are on the way.  Fire

trucks with them.  Everything's

slowed down because of the rain.

We're bringing in portable

generators.  They'll get the

emergency lights working but they

won't pump enough power to lift the

doors.

IPPOLITO

D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.

D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)

(a string of curses followed by...)

Where the hell are you?

IPPOLITO

I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate

the rescue efforts from here.  Help

is on the way.  Just sit tight.

D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)

It's a little late, you son of a

bitch.  There's a friggin' monster

loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire

department.  Find metal cutters, cut

through.  And bring a cannon.  The

damn thing is huge.

WATERS

Did he say monster?

IPPOLITO

Panic attack.

IPPOLITO (OS)

D'Agosta, put on the Mayor.

MAYOR

Mayor Jordan here.

IPPOLITO (ON RADIO)

This is Ippolito, head of museum

security.  Relieve D'Agosta and take

command.

MAYOR

Don't tell me what to do you chicken

shit bastard.  I saw you cut and run!

Lieutenant D'Agosta stayed with us.

He is in charge.  There is a monster.

I saw it.  Cut through those doors

and get us out of here, now!

IPPOLITO

All right.  The steel doors are

designed to retard cutting.  We can

go through them, but it would take

hours.

WATERS

The quickest way in would be to go

through the roof, sir.  Cell two goes

up to the fifth floor.  There are sky

lights up there.

IPPOLITO

Co-ordinate with the fire department

and SWAT teams.  Move.

PENDERGAST

I don't know how to deal with this.

It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever

saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a

monster, a supernatural creature

like that.

MARGO

It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an

animal.  Part lizard, part human, a

genetic freak of some kind, like the

half-goat, half-sheep they found

last year in the jungles of Vietnam.

PENDERGAST

But this isn't the jungle!  This is

New York.  How did it get here?  A

thing like that crossed two

continents.  It makes no sense!

FROCK

(lame)

We think it may have something to do

with the eggs we found in the crate.

PENDERGAST

I don't believe it.

MARGO

None of that matters now.  The people

upstairs need us.  We have to help.

FROCK

We can't.  We've managed to get

inside the one place that's safe.  I

think we should sit tight and wait

for reinforcements.  If we go

outside, we're risking more lives.

You have to accept it, Margo,

there's nothing we can do.  The

building must be swarming with

police by now.  It won't take long

for them to get through the doors.

MARGO

That thing could kill ten people in

a matter of minutes.

PENDERGAST

But what can we do?  Our guns are

useless --

MARGO

We have the fibers.  Don't you see?

The creature is hungry.  It wants the

hormones in these plants.  It would

take hundreds of human brains to

supply what's in these fibers.  We're

just a poor substitute.  To make it

stop hunting, we have to give it

what it wants.

CUTHBERT

Solid oak.  Two inches thick.  Tell me

they'll hold.

CUTHBERT

I got it after I was mugged in the

subway last spring.

JONATHAN

Where's the walk-in safe?

CUTHBERT

Behind you.

JONATHAN

What's the combination?

CUTHBERT

I'll do it.  Just let me find my

portable phone.

JONATHAN

Forget it!

CUTHBERT

Calm down.  I found it!

CUTHBERT

Battery's dead.  Shit.

JONATHAN

Let's go!

CUTHBERT

That thing won't come after us,

right?  It's going for bigger game.

The group blundering around in the

basement.  Poor fools.

JONATHAN

Hurry up!

CUTHBERT

Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the

gun.

CUTHBERT

Oh God!  I dropped my rabbit's foot!

JONATHAN

For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's

the combination?!

CUTHBERT

To the left twice then five no...

sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's

been a while...

JONATHAN

Oh Jesus...

JONATHAN

Fifteen... what's next?

CUTHBERT

Eight to the right!  Look!  I found

it!

PENDERGAST

All clear.

FROCK

I'm coming with you.

MARGO

No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.

PENDERGAST

You'd slow us down and put Margo in

danger.

MARGO

Unlock one of the other storage

rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll

leave a trail back to 1012 and try

to trap the monster in here.

FROCK

Margo, this is too dangerous.  You

always think you can solve

everything.  This time you don't have

enough information.  The animal might

behave in unexpected ways.

(to Pendergast)

Leave her here with me.  Don't put

her in danger.

PENDERGAST

He's right.

MARGO

No.  You'll need me --

FROCK

What's that?

PENDERGAST

Footsteps!

MARGO

No, not footsteps!  People running

for their lives!

FROCK

Come back and get me.

MARGO

We will.

FROCK

Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It

hunts with its sense of smell.  So

for God's sake, Margo, don't get

those fibers on your clothes!

KAWAKITA

It's still back there!

D'AGOSTA

I know.

PENDERGAST (OS)

Where are you?  Who's there?

D'AGOSTA

Pendergast!

PENDERGAST

That was D'Agosta.

MARGO

The planetarium!

PENDERGAST

(calls out)

Vince!

D'AGOSTA (OS)

Over here!

D'AGOSTA

(through the window)

Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind

us!

PENDERGAST

This door's locked.  Try shooting the

hinges off.

D'AGOSTA

Step back!

D'AGOSTA

It's no use.  We have to get out of

here!

(to Kawakita)

Give them your walkie talkie.

KAWAKITA

Is Dr. Frock safe!

MARGO

Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of

yourself!

MARGO

Is there another way around?

PENDERGAST

No.  The planetarium is in the next

cell.  This is one of the fire

doors...

PENDERGAST

Vince?  There's no way we can get to

you with the fire doors down.

There's an entrance to the sub-

basement in the hall off the north

side exit.

D'AGOSTA

The sub-basement?

PENDERGAST

I've been down there.  It links up to

the old sewer system.  I can guide

you out.

D'AGOSTA

How much ammo do we have to make a

stand?

KAWAKITA

You're asking me?  I don't even know

how to load this thing.

FRANK

Four rounds...

D'AGOSTA

Oh shit.

D'AGOSTA

I smell it.  It's here.

PENDERGAST

Go out the north exit!  There's a

hallway and a false wall by the

Greek vases.  Run!

D'AGOSTA

Everybody.  Get behind me.

PENDERGAST

Hide quickly!

MARGO

What are you going to do?

PENDERGAST

Buy them some time.

PENDERGAST

Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here!

PENDERGAST

Come on, you smelly pile of refuse.

Come get me.  I dare you!

MARGO

What is it doing?

PENDERGAST

(loud)

It's scared of me.

PENDERGAST

Drop the fibers!

PENDERGAST

What happened?

MARGO

Its eyesight is worse than I

thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it

couldn't smell us through the glass.

PENDERGAST

It didn't want the fibers.  What does

that mean?

MARGO

I think... it means it's full.

PENDERGAST

Then it won't go after the others?

MARGO

No.  It's still hunting, but not for

the hormones.

PENDERGAST

For what?

MARGO

I think... for the pleasure of the

kill.

D'AGOSTA

That's it, let's go!

D'AGOSTA

(into walkie talkie)

Pendergast.  We made it.  You all

right?

PENDERGAST

We're fine.  Take the left fork

behind you.  You'll be in a straight

passage.  When the hall forks again

in fifty yards go right.  Then radio

back.

D'AGOSTA

All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.

KAWAKITA

Oh shit.

FRANK

No, Lieutenant.  He's not a good

enough shot.  I'll do it if you take

care of my daughter.

D'AGOSTA

Damn.  It's getting deep.  See

anything?

FRANK

You'll be the first to know.

D'AGOSTA

Pendergast?  I made the right hand

fork.  We're already in about three

feet of water.  Where should we go?

D'AGOSTA

Hello!

FRANK (OS)

Sweet Jesus, help!

D'AGOSTA

Frank!  Are you all right!

MAYOR

It's too late!

LAUREN

Dad!

D'AGOSTA

Run!

D'AGOSTA

On three.

D'AGOSTA

One... two...

KAWAKITA

I think it's gone.

D'AGOSTA

I think you took its tonsils out!

MAYOR

Which way!

D'AGOSTA

This way!

KAWAKITA

Holy shit.

PENDERGAST

Vince?  Can you hear me?  Vince!

MARGO

We have to try and draw it off!

PENDERGAST

How?

MARGO

The answer's right in front of us.

MARGO

That's a ptarmigan, feigning a

broken wing.  The bird pretends to be

injured to draw the fox away from

its nest!

PENDERGAST

(starts running)

It's deceptively simple.  Like a

Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.

MARGO

Help!  Please someone!  Help!

JENNINGS

We're ready.  We've got enough

firepower to turn a herd of lions

into a fine red mist.

IPPOLITO

Then do it.

JONATHAN

It's okay, Hobbes.  We'll be all

right.  Help has got to come

eventually... We'll make it.  We'll be

fine.

JONATHAN

Hey!  Wake up!

DRUNK

Who the hell are you?

JONATHAN

You first.

DRUNK

I got lost tryin' to find the

bathroom.  I was walkin' in circles.

I lay down for a nap.  What's going

on?

JONATHAN

You wouldn't believe me if I told

you.

JONATHAN

What is it, boy?

DRUNK

Where we going?

JONATHAN

I think we're going home.

JONATHAN

Hello!  We're over here!

JENNINGS

Are you hurt?

JONATHAN

We're fine.  I don't know about the

people downstairs.  In the Hall of

the Heavens.  The basement... you'll

need help.  There's a monster down

there.

JENNINGS

The rescue workers will lift you out

one at a time.

MARGO

Help someone!

PENDERGAST

Oh God!  Help!

MARGO

You smell that?

PENDERGAST

It's coming.  Run.

D'AGOSTA

At least we'll be dry.

KAWAKITA

I believe in you a hundred percent,

Vince, but that's the second time

we've been at that intersection.

D'AGOSTA

Not so loud.

KAWAKITA

What's that?

D'AGOSTA

All right everybody, hold up!

D'AGOSTA

We don't know what's in there.  Let

me go first.

D'AGOSTA

What does it say?

KAWAKITA

(looks up, shocked)

Dr. John Whittlesley.

D'AGOSTA

What's that doing here?

KAWAKITA

I don't know.  I thought Dr.

Whittlesley died in South America.

MAYOR

(interrupts)

Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I

think it goes up to the street!

KAWAKITA

What is that?

KAWAKITA

Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?

D'AGOSTA

I'd say we're in its home.

PENDERGAST

We're not going to make the storage

room!

MARGO

Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's

DNA is part homo sapien.  In

primates, the eye is a direct path

to the brain!  If you get a clean

shot, there's only one place you can

kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!

PENDERGAST

Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo!

unexpectedly HUMAN

in its eyes!  In astonishment, she

MARGO

My God.  You understand.

MARGO

Please let me go.  We won't hurt you.

PENDERGAST

Run!

A NECKLACE OF SILVER

gleams around the beast's throat too!  The

MARGO

John's necklace!  You killed him!

MARGO

Oh Jesus.  John?

MARGO

No.  It's not possible!

MARGO

John?  If it is you... I can help.

MARGO

No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you

were right.  It's John!

PENDERGAST

What?

MARGO

That thing is John Whittlesley.  I

should have seen it before!  The

fibers are infected with a virus.

You eat them, and the virus alters

your DNA!  He became addicted to them

in South America, followed the

plants back to the states.  He

probably entered the country as a

man.  It would have taken several

months for the change to take place.

That's how he got from the boat to

the museum!

PENDERGAST

I don't believe it.

MARGO

You have to!  Listen!  All viruses

pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the

cells of the host to make more

viruses!  This one was different.  It

inserted a whole array of genes into

John.  Reptile genes, sixty five

million years old.  Those genes

remade him!  It's not his fault!

PENDERGAST

Whatever that thing is, we have to

kill it!

WATERS

We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No

one's answering!  What do you want to

do?

IPPOLITO

Holy shit.  Pull him up.

IPPOLITO

Get more guns!  Now!

IPPOLITO

Get back!  We're going to shoot!

MARGO

No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first!

IPPOLITO

(screaming)

Kill that thing!  Kill it now!

MARGO

No!

MARGO

John... you can give up now!  Just lie

down where you are!

WATERS

Holy shit it's coming this way!

IPPOLITO

It's headed for the roof.  Run!

WATERS

Get back here, you asshole!  We can't

let it get out!

(to the S.W.A.T. team)

Surround the opening and kill it!

WATERS

Back, everybody!  That's an order!

MARGO

Just like John.  He won't listen.

PENDERGAST

I have to shoot.

MARGO

Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the

eye.

PENDERGAST

He has to look here or I won't get a

clear shot.  Call him, Margo.

MARGO

I can't!

PENDERGAST

You have to.  Do it now!

MARGO

John!  John, look at me!

DISSOLVE TO:

KAWAKITA

Margo Green.  Have you seen her?

PENDERGAST

She's over here.

PENDERGAST

Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

D'AGOSTA

The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARGO

No time for fishing anymore?

KAWAKITA

Got to finish this thesis sometime.

MARGO

How about lunch?

KAWAKITA

Not today.  Besides, I think the

director of the museum is expecting

you.

MARGO

Okay.

MARGO

Dr. Frock?

FROCK

Look who's here, Margo.

MARGO

I'm so glad to see you.  What's the

occasion?

PENDERGAST

I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to

see Vince and we thought we'd see

the new display.

PENDERGAST

Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What

happened to the rest of

Whittlesley's plants?

FROCK

They were sent to the Center For

Disease Control in Atlanta.

D'AGOSTA

Shouldn't a drug that powerful be

destroyed?

FROCK

The virus itself might have positive

applications.  They'll keep the

plants in secure lock up while the

studies are made.

(beat)

Greg isn't joining us?

MARGO

He's changed.  He's always working on

his thesis.  He comes in early, stays

late.  I tried to get him to join us,

but he never takes a break.

PENDERGAST

We did the right thing, Margo.

MARGO

Yes.  I know.

FADE OUT:
