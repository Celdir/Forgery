JULIE

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

(a beat)

It's been a year since my last

confession...

JULIE (cont'd)

I've never told anyone this. Not my

mom, not the poice, not even my

friends -- except for the ones who

were there and they...well they're

not around anymore. You see I...I...

PRIEST

Yes?

JULIE

I killed a man. Well, I thought I

had...then...

JULIE (cont'd)

(emotional)

You've got to understand...It was

all an accident. A terrible accident.

It's been a whole year. I've tried to

get past this, but I just can't.

PRIEST

Go on...

JULIE

I have these dreams...horrible

dreams. And this man is always there

with me.

PRIEST

(reassuring)

I know...

JULIE

You see, he was a killer. He

murdered Helen and Barry, and he

would have killed me too, if I

hadn't...gotten away with it.

(regathering)

I don't know, I guess I just need to

deal with the fear, the guilt...to

finally say his name. Ben Willis. His

name was Ben Willis...

PRIEST

I know...

JULIE

You know? But how could you...

PRIEST

(growls)

I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!

Nice to see you find Political

Science so stimulating --

JULIE

I'm sorry --

WILL

Julie! Wait! You okay?

JULIE

I'm fine.

WILL

You sure?

JULIE

I'm fine.

WILL

You don't seem fine.

JULIE

I had another dream, Will.

WILL

The shower again?

JULIE

It was in a church...it was so real.

I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

WILL

(caring)

I'm sorry.

JULIE

I thought I was over the dreams for

good. I really did. I hadn't had one

for months.

WILL

It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna

get better.

JULIE

It can't get worse. I mean, it's not

like this was the first time I

freaked out in class. I hardly ever

get a full night's sleep, my grades

suck, I'm this close from being thrown

out of school.

JULIE

(cont'd)

It was one year ago...

WILL

It's...the anniversary. That's what's

going on...Take it easy on yourself.

JULIE

(weary)

I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I

don't even know why I came up here in

the first place.

WILL

(cheering her up)

To get out of Southport?

JULIE

(softens)

Right. Now I remember.

JULIE (cont'd)

Are you getting out of town on the

fourth?

WILL

Nah. I'll probably just be here

studying for finals. The joys of

summer school...

(beat)

Are you okay?

JULIE

I'm okay.

WILL

Are you sure?

JULIE

Thanks for the talk, Will. You're

good to me.

WILL

Um...Okay. Bye.

JULIE

Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.

RAY

I got in early. I was excited...

(re: the receding Will)

Who was that guy?

JULIE

Oh, that's Will. He's a friend.

You'd like him.

RAY

Yeah.

JULIE

Ray, we're just friend.

RAY

Every guy in history who tried to

pick up a girl did the good-friend

thing first.

JULIE

Why are you being like this?

RAY

Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are

you ready to go? I've got the old

truck. You know the drill...Crab

boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen

Pageant...It's only small-town fun,

but it's still nice. People really

miss you. I miss you.

JULIE

(softly, but resolved)

Ray, I can't...

RAY

Can't what?

JULIE

I just feel like some part of me

hasn't healed up enough to go back.

Like some critical piece is missing.

Please understand...

RAY

I understand something.

JULIE

It's not like that. It's not you.

It's me. My head. I want to go back.

I want to be with you. I want to be

fine. I want everything to be like

it used to be.

(beat)

It just isn't.

JULIE (cont'd)

Hey, why don't you stay up here?

They have fireworks over the river.

And...there's a million things to do.

RAY

I have to work, Julie. My boat's in

Southport, remember? But, I get it.

You need your space from Craokerland.

And maybe from me, too.

RAY (cont'd)

You know where to find me.

JULIE

Ray? Ray? At least come up for a

while.

RAY

It's okay. I'm just gonna go.

JULIE

Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

(to herself)

I'm just scared...that's all.

KARLA

I thought you were out of town!

JULIE

What are you doing in my closet?

KARLA

i just wanted your black pants, but

I'm not ready to die for them!

JULIE

That was heart attack time, Karla.

KARLA

No. When I put these skinny pants on

my body...Now, that's heart attack

time.

KARLA (cont'd)

And we're going to put away the

utensils and you're coming with me.

JULIE

I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,

ugly, and depressed.

KARLA

Yeah, right -- whatever.

JULIE

I think I just really hurt Ray's

feelings.

KARLA

(keeping it upbeat)

Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great

guy, nothing against old Ray, but

he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in

Southport. Will's a nice guy, too,

and he lives right down the street.

JULIE

There's nothing between Will and me.

KARLA (V.O.)

Yet. Nothing yet.

KARLA (cont'd)

What we gotta do is keep moving. No

TYRELL

Just for a minute, baby. I got

something I wanna tell you.

KARLA

(teasing)

If you can say all you gotta say

in a minute then I don't wanna hear

it.

TYRELL

I'll talk real slow.

KARLA

(re: Julie)

Ask her to dance.

KARLA (cont'd)

Go on.

TYRELL

You're the most beautiful woman

in the bar tonight, Jules.

JULIE

Tyrell, you are an unstoppable

force of nature.

TYRELL

That's right. It's how the species

survives. You'll never convince me

otherwise.

(beat)

Wanna dance?

KARLA

Say yes.

JULIE

No.

KARLA

No means yes.

JULIE

Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have

you seen my people dance? We make

the mouth face, we move the

fingers --

TYRELL

Worse comes to worse, you can stand

there and watch me.

KARLA

Come on, I'll take a break and

we'll all dance.

Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?

KARLA

Nope. I told him that you

absolutely, positively would not be

here at this bar between ten o'clock

and eleven o'clock tonight. And then

he came anyway.

WILL

(shy to a fault)

This was not my idea.

JULIE

What?

WILL

I said, this...Do you want a drink?

TYRELL

Where I come from, you want to

snatch the goodies, you got to at

least talk to them first.

WILL

How about a drink?

TYRELL

Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or

how about a Mai-Tai?

NANCY

How about some ID?

NANCY (cont'd)

Kidding.

WILL

The guy at the desk said the place would

be quiet, not dead.

NANCY

Didn't anyone tell you this is --

TYRELL

The last day of the season. Yeah, we

heard.

WILL

So why are you still here?

NANCY

That's none of your business.

TYRELL

What's the matter, boy trouble?

NANCY

Not anymore.

TYRELL

He leave you?

NANCY

No. I shot him.

NANCY (cont'd)

What you want is a Dark and Stormy:

Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch

of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck

in the hurricane season, trust me.

JULIE

Am I bad? I mean, he's really great,

and he's cute --

KARLA

He's cute...And he's got a crush on

you...

(off Julie's look)

But...

JULIE

(appologetic)

I miss Ray...I tried to call him.

KARLA

Ray made up his own mind...so, you're

free to make up yours.

KARLA (cont'd)

Your smile is a frown...turned upside

down.

TYRELL

Pretty cool bar.

Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the

So what do you do around here for fun?

NANCY

Make fun of tourists mainly.

KARLA

Karaoke -- perfect.

JULIE

Don't even think about it.

KARLA

Okay, I won't.

TYRELL

Go baby! Go!

KARLA

Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is

JULIE

No way.

KARLA

Yes.

JULIE

No.

KARLA

Yes.

Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry

TYRELL

There's a storm coming?

It's dead.

Duh. The next couple of days is gonna

KARLA

What about a radio?

I'd call this four spoiled city kids who
