FINAL SCRIPT

November 2006

READER NOTE

One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not

to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this

film are played by only three actors:

1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel

2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra

3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary

It'll make more sense in context. Promise.

Hey!   Do you sell crack?

It's cool.     I'm only a cop on TV.

GARY

Yes, hello. I'm having a medical

situation. Yes. Okay. I don't

have a belly button.

(explaining carefully)

I do not have a belly button where

I should, on my belly. And I'm

concerned, because I don't know if

that's...

GARY (CONT'D)

Can a person live without a belly

button? Because if you think about

it, you're born with one. So if

you don't have one, you're unborn

and it's really hazy whether you're

alive or not. I guess I'm

wondering: am I alive?

(a sudden thought)

Or what if I'm God?

GARY (CONT'D)

No, no.   I'm totally sober.

GARY (CONT'D)

No, I don't think I need an

ambulance. I don't seem to be

dying any faster than usual. But I

should probably go to the hospital,

don't you think? Yeah, I should.

trying to locate his missing navel.

He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two

thumbs-up.

shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're

Gary has rolled the car.

The music suddenly STOPS.    We hear SIRENS approaching.

INT. COURTHOUSE PROCESSING AREA - DAY

MARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself.

MARGARET

La la la la la. Like you've never

done worse.

From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But

it was an environmentally friendly

car. Why doesn't that get

reported?

A beat.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Please! He was heartbroken,

betrayed. You say you understand

but you don't. You can't. You're

like a big giant Vulcan.

6.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

He's coming. I'll call you later.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Hi.    Margaret. I work for Lola.

GARY

Gary.

MARGARET

I know.

(to the Parole Officer)

We need to go out the back.

GARY

Are there reporters out front?

MARGARET

A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More

like Robert Downey, Jr. when he

broke into that family's house and

slept in the kid's bed like

Goldilocks. "This bed is just

right." I handled episodes two

through four for Robert. This sort

of thing is my specialty.

GARY

What is?

MARGARET

Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry.

Mama's gonna take good care of you.

PAROLE OFFICER

Answer it.

GARY

Hello?     Yes. Yes.

GARY (CONT'D)

The weather in Toledo is rainy.

PAROLE OFFICER

Use your normal voice.

GARY

(to the phone)

Nine dogs ran through the field.

The koala sits in the tree.

MARGARET

It's computer voice recognition.

The system can call you any time

day or night. If you don't answer

within five rings, the police come

and haul your ass off.

GARY

What if I'm not here?

MARGARET

That's why it's called house

arrest. You stay inside your

house.

(to the officer)

He can take direction, I promise.

MARGARET

Okay, just so it's said, this house

is flammable.

GARY

I didn't mean to burn down my

house.

MARGARET

Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way

into a ten-year shame spiral, but I

did, and it's healthier to

acknowledge it.

(moving on)

This flammable house belongs to one

of Lola's other fabulous clients,

who is currently shooting a pilot

in Toronto.

GARY

Actor?

MARGARET

Writer. So for the next six weeks,

su casa es su casa. I say, feel

free to wear his clothes. He'll

probably get a sick thrill of out

it. The gays.

GARY

He has dogs?

MARGARET

They're away at summer camp.    Now,

try the bed.

GARY

It's fine.

MARGARET

Comfortable?

GARY

Sure.

9.

MARGARET

Look, Gary, I know this has been

crazy and stressful. I want you to

feel safe. And comfortable.

GARY

I do.

MARGARET

I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your

number-one fan.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

But if you fuck this up, I will

smash your ankles with a sledge

hammer.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

That wouldn't be comfortable for

either of us.

MARGARET

I'll be coming by twice a day to

check up on you. I'm the only

person who should be coming by. No

buddies, no pals, no heroin

dealers...

GARY

I don't do heroin.

MARGARET

Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not

buying you porn. There's spray-per-

view on cable.

GARY

Good. I really wasn't concerned

about my career, my family or my

future. I just wanted to jack off.

10.

MARGARET

Let me see your phone.

GARY

C'mon!   All my numbers are in that.

MARGARET

Dial ten digits at random. Whoever

answers will be better than the

people on this phone.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

You have my cell number. You have

delivery menus. You're fine.

Right?

GARY

I guess.

Once we get these samples back to

the Crime Lab, we'll know who the

real killer is.

GARY

Is somebody there?   Hello?

GARY (CONT'D)

Hello?!

(relieved)

Yes. Yes.

GARY (CONT'D)

Nine leopards run through the

jungle.

(listening)

I bought two cakes at the store.

13.

GARY (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)

The house is haunted. There's a

zeitgeist, or something.

127                                                               127

MARGARET

Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they

were rats. L.A. is teaming with

rats. They live in the palm trees.

GARY

Sure.   Maybe.

MARGARET

Okay. You know I'm a licensed

psychotherapist.

GARY

Really?

MARGARET

No. I'm a publicist. My job is

what other people think of you, not

what you think of yourself. So

pull your shit together. I am

thisclose to getting Christine

Walsh to do your piece in Parade.

GARY

Parade?   I fucking hate Parade.

MARGARET

Everyone hates Parade. But the

people who watch "Crime Lab," they

love their Marilyn Vos Savant.

Give them a woman of indeterminate

age who solves riddles and they are

in hee-haw heaven.

GARY

Okay.

MARGARET

One heartfelt act of contrition and

maybe the showrunner won't kill off

your character between seasons.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

I swear to God, if you go batshit

on me...

GARY

I'm not crazy.

Exactly.    Exactly.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Sorry!   Really sorry.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Over here. To your left.

(correcting)

Right. Sorry. Right.

SARAH

I'm working on my putting, if you

can believe it.

GARY

Not really.

SARAH

Okay. Maybe I was just looking for

a way to meet my infamous neighbor.

You see, I'm under house arrest,

too.

GARY

What did you do?

15.

SARAH

I had sex with my husband.

GARY

That's awful.

SARAH

Nine months later, I had Jaden.

That's her over there.

She points to a small portable baby monitor.

GARY

She's cute.

SARAH

She's sleeping for another...

(checks watch)

...seventeen minutes. She keeps to

a schedule.

GARY

She sounds really boring.

SARAH

(whispers)

She is.

A beat.   A smile between them.

GARY

You're rich. Shouldn't you have a

nanny from Ecuador?

SARAH

I'm Canadian.

GARY

(as if that explains it)

Ohhh...

SARAH

I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I

want to maintain this air of moral

superiority by doing everything

myself.

GARY

Very Canadian.

SARAH

Thanks.

Another pregnant pause.

16.

SARAH (CONT'D)

Listen, Jaden goes down again at

2:30. Maybe I could stop by.

GARY

I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

SARAH

It's a date.

GARY

Is it?

Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way.

Yeah.    I know.

Okay.

Voltaire. Candide.

Are you actually reading it?

I thought I was.

Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever.

Ah!   How boring of her.

Housewarming gift.

GARY

Demon liquor.

The best part is, I can drink it.

I pumped before I came.

So did I.

GARY

... so it's kind of hard to prove

that I only meant to burn my ex-

girlfriend's stuff, and not the

entire house.

SARAH

Yeah.   Fire's tricky that way.

GARY

How about you? Any history of

arson?

SARAH

Strangely enough...

GARY

I knew it!     I could see that little

spark.

SARAH

It wasn't arson.    Probably.

SARAH (CONT'D)

Okay. When I was a little girl,

our house caught on fire.

19.

GARY

Oh shit.

MUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue.

SARAH

I'll never forget the look on my

father's face as he gathered me up

in his arms and raced through the

burning building, out onto the

pavement.

ON GARY, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at

the same time.

SARAH (CONT'D)

I stood there shivering in my

pajamas and watched the whole world

go up in flames. And when it was

all over, I said to myself, "Is

that all there is to a fire?" Is

that all there is?

As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at

all. It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is."

SARAH (CONT'D)

Is that all there is, is that all there is?

If that's all there is my friends, then let's

keep dancing.

She leans closer.

SARAH (CONT'D)

Let's break out the booze and have a ball.

If that's all there is.

Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the

couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for

dancing.

SARAH (CONT'D)

Is that all there is, is that all there is?

If that's all there is my friends, then let's

keep dancing.

Let's break out the booze and have a ball,

If that's all there is.

SARAH

Then I fell in love with the most

wonderful boy in the world. We

would take long walks by the river

or just sit for hours gazing into

each other's eyes. We were so very

much in love. Then one day he went

away and I thought I'd die. But I

didn't. And when I didn't, I said

to myself, "Is that all there is to

love?"

I know what you're thinking.

If that's the way she feels about

it why doesn't she just end it all?

I'm in no hurry for that final

disappointment. I know just as

well as I'm standing here talking

to you, when that final moment

comes and I'm breathing my last

breath, I'll be saying to myself...

Yes. Yes. Two trains run through

the forest.

Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression.

He nearly drops the phone.

Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for

speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right.

MALE COMPUTER VOICE

Nine.    Nine. Nine. Nine.

Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and

jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into

SOMEONE ELSE.

He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE

MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is

gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.

Gary bolts for the door.

Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a

RAT TRAP,

which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.

He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main

floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.

Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out

through the open door.

A160                                                                A160

EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT

HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing

us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit

signage.

24.

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab.

("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo

poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen

for you.")

It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his

toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here

from the house, which is probably a block away.

There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.

Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl

(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter

to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.

GARY

Jesus!   You scared the shit out

of...

She signs "What's wrong?"

GARY (CONT'D)

(confused)

What?

NOELLE

(signed, subtitled)

You're hurt.

GARY

I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I

don't...

She points to his toes.   Getting what she must mean...

GARY (CONT'D)

I'm fine.    I'll be fine.

Looking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here

by herself.

GARY (CONT'D)

Where are your parents?

She looks at him oddly, not really getting the question.

GARY (CONT'D)

Your mom, your dad. Where are

they?

NOELLE

(signed, subtitled)

Mom is at the car. Where you left

her.

Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying.

25.

NOELLE (CONT'D)

(signed, subtitled)

You're lost.

GARY

Look, you need to go back, okay?

You shouldn't be out here. It's

not safe.

Noelle glances to her left.

We hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the

curb.

GARY (CONT'D)

Shit.

We go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car.

Gary looks back.

Noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have

disappeared.

Putting on his best face for the police...

GARY (CONT'D)

Evening, officers.

CUT TO:

B160                                                                B160

INT./EXT.   POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Handcuffed, Gary is placed in back.     He's reserving the right

to remain silent.

MARGARET (PRE-LAP)

Once again, the idea of house

arrest is you stay inside your

house.

160                                                                     160

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet

to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also

features bandaged toes.

MARGARET

Think of it like an electronic

leash. Basically, if you ever go

more than 100 feet from the base

station...

She points to an electronic device by the wall.

26.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

...the cops come, they throw your

ass in jail. If you ever try to

take it off, the cops come and

throw your ass in jail. And if

they ever detect drugs or alcohol

in your system...

GARY

...the cops come and throw my ass

in jail.

MARGARET

No. I kick your ass. Then the

cops come and throw your ass in

jail.

GARY

Do I still have to answer the

phone?

MARGARET

No, I'll be doing that from now on.

I'm moving into the guest room.

GARY

I don't need a babysitter.

MARGARET

Despite all evidence to the

contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool

roomie. Who do you think taught

Affleck how to gamble?

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Let's never hear that again.

Behold! The edge of your world.

In the world.

Out of the world. In the world.

Out of the world. Look at me, I'm

dancin'!

GARY

So the guy was like, "Do you know

fencing?" And I say, of course.

That's what it says on my headshot.

MARGARET

Lies!

GARY

Always.   So he says, "Foil or epi?"

MARGARET

Epee.

GARY

I say, I'm about equal in both.

MARGARET

Which is true.

GARY

So he tosses me this fucking Conan

sword and goes after me. I'm just

swinging, trying to stay alive.

But I end up cutting his ear.

MARGARET

You cut his ear off?

GARY

Just a little. But I got the job.

28.

MARGARET

Wait. You were in Pirates of the

Caribbean?

GARY

Yes. No. Not the movie, the ride.

I was like, "Gar! Keep both hands

inside the boat!"

Groceries.

GARY

How's Jaden?

SARAH

Boring. We haven't had nearly the

grand old time you two have been

having.

GARY

You've been watching.

30.

SARAH

Well. I don't want to meddle in

your affairs.

GARY

My affairs?

SARAH

Everyone needs affection.    I get

it.

GARY

I don't.    Are you seriously

jealous?

SARAH

The opposite. I just want to

protect her.

GARY

From what?

SARAH

From you. Look at you. You date

models. Actresses. Tennis

players.

GARY

Yeah.

SARAH

On a scale of one to ten, you

belong with the Nines. We both

know you won't settle for less.

What are "the Nines?"

GARY

What?

31.

MARGARET

"Look for the Nines."

GARY

It's not mine.

MARGARET

It's your handwriting.

GARY

I didn't write it.

MARGARET

Okay.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

All-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.

MARGARET

Nothing.

GARY

Seriously, what?

Nothing. I thought you

Yhello? Hi. What?!

I have to take this.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

Well, who thought it was a good

idea letting Courtney into a

pottery shop?

MARGARET

I know who you are.

SARAH

Really.

MARGARET

I know what you are. And if you

come near him again...

SARAH

You'll what?

SARAH (CONT'D)

What are you going to do, M...

SARAH (CONT'D)

Sorry, what's he calling you?

MARGARET

Margaret.

SARAH

I like that. "Margaret."   Classic.

MARGARET

Why can't you just leave him alone?

SARAH

Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's

watching him, he doesn't really

exist.

(approaching)

And for the record, I'm not the one

deceiving him.

(MORE)

33.

SARAH (CONT'D)

He's going to figure it out

eventually. And when he does, who

do you think he's gonna blame?

Sarah lets her warning land, then walks past Margaret,

heading back down the stairs.

REVEAL Gary watching through the hole in the door.

A173                                                                 A173

INT. FOYER - DAY

Gary heard the whole conversation.   Or at least enough of it

to be deeply freaked out.

INT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT

Margaret leans out her doorway:

MARGARET

Goodnight, ratface.

GARY

Goodnight.

INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his

still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking,

but the wheels are turning.

176                                                                      176

EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING

Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts

circling things with a red Sharpie.

MACRO CLOSE UP.    His pen circles the number nine every time

it appears.

As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the

rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own

newspaper, still in the wrapper.

SARAH

Hey neighbor.

GARY

Hi.

34.

SARAH

Sorry for the psychotic episode.

I'll blame it on hormones.

GARY

Okay.

SARAH

Are you alright? You look a little

Beautiful Mind-ish.

He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:

GARY

How many times should the number

nine come up? Probablistically?

SARAH

Probablistically?

GARY

(annoyed)

You know what I mean.

SARAH

One time out of ten.

GARY

How about every time?

He hands her the paper through the bars.

GARY (CONT'D)

But they only show up when you look

for them. Looking for them changes

things.

Trying to find an explanation...

SARAH

Some of these are prices. There's

going to be a lot of nines when...

GARY

There is something wrong with the

world.

Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long

beat. She's stalling, thinking.

SARAH

You have an eyelash on your...

here...

She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the

bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS:

35.

SARAH (CONT'D)

I can get you out of here.    But you

have to trust me.

MARGARET [O.S.]

Morning.

MARGARET

Everything okay?

GARY

Peachy.

MARGARET

Peachy's good. I like peaches.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

You want coffee?

GARY

Sure.

GARY (CONT'D)

What do I do?

SARAH

You have to trust me.

177                                                                    177

36.

Margaret enters, carrying two mugs.   She watches him warily.

MARGARET

You okay?

GARY

No.

MARGARET

Oh.

GARY

Tell me about the Nines.

MARGARET

The Nines?

GARY

The Nines.

MARGARET

Sort of hard to start there...

GARY

Try. And don't tell me I'm

imagining it. They're showing up

everywhere, and I want to know why.

Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:

MARGARET

Best guess? They're your

subconscious trying to remind you

who you are.

GARY

I'm a Nine?

MARGARET

Yes. It doesn't make a lot of

sense of out context.

(offering)

Coffee?

He takes the mug, then reconsiders.   Maybe it's laced with

something.

GARY

Why don't you drink coffee?   You're

always drinking tea.

Frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. She'd

really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but

it's just too hot.

37.

MARGARET

Happy?

She gestures for him to sit down.     Reluctantly, he does.    She

sits across from him.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

You're not going to understand this

yet, but we've known each other for

like 25 years. One day when I was

12, you called me out of the blue.

And we've been talking ever since.

GARY

Talking.

MARGARET

On the phone. Usually.

GARY

I never met you before I came here.

MARGARET

You, Gary, never met me. But

you're not always...

(lacking the words)

I can understand why you're a

little confused.

GARY

No.   I'm a lot confused.

MARGARET

Theories?

GARY

This is all a dream.

MARGARET

No.

GARY

I'm in a coma.

MARGARET

(amused)

No.

GARY

Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or

Purgatorium or something.

MARGARET

Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans

vomited. But no. This is as real

as anything can be.

38.

GARY

(suspicious)

What does that mean?

MARGARET

Everything is what it is. But

you're not who you think you are.

178                                                                   178

MARGARET (CONT'D)

God, no!   Please, Gary, don't.

MARGARET

You don't know what you're doing.

GARY

What happens if I cross this line?

MARGARET

I don't know. But it's not good.

39.

GARY

Oh shit.

The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames.

We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating

through her skin, right to the bone.

The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it

like an etched x-ray.

As the light hits Gary, we...

CUT TO BLACK.

READER NOTE: Part 2 is a half-hour episode

of a Project Greenlight-style documentary

series called "Behind the Screen," which

tracks the progress of a one-hour TV drama

pilot from conception through delivery. In

keeping with the genre, it's very fast and

cutty.

INTERVIEW sequences are done to an off-

camera interviewer.

Some scenes are unscripted. The gist of

these scenes is summarized in italics.

INT.   LAUNDRY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY

Gavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's

hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. (Note: This is the

same house from Part One.)

We hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin

kneels down to greet...

GAVIN

Puggies!

Gavin's PUGS pounce all over him.

INT.   KITCHEN - DAY [MINUTES LATER]

Gavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he

sorts through massive piles of mail.

On his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet

Gary wore in Part One.

It's weird being back. It doesn't

INT.   FOYER - DAY

Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's

been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie.

GAVIN (V.O.)

At this stage, you have the script

you wrote, and the film you shot,

but you don't know how it's all

going to come together. You just

know how you want it to feel.

He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the

Disclavier unit.

INT. EDITING SUITE - DAY

Susan, Gavin and the EDITOR watch the cut.   Susan is taking

notes on a legal pad.

JUMP CUT TO:

Susan flips to her next note.   TITLES list her position as:

45.

SUSAN

I just don't know if you need the

cold open. People want to get

right to the story.

221                                                                     221

GAVIN

I invited Susan to see a rough cut

because I trust her taste.

SUSAN

Could we be more clear why Mary is

so freaked out at that moment?

GAVIN

Wow. I thought it was pretty

obvious. And dramatic.

GAVIN [INTERVIEW]

More importantly, I trust her as a

barometer of Roger's taste.

SUSAN

I know. But that's Roger's big

thing this season. Never let the

audience be confused.

CUT TO:

222                                                                     222

GAVIN

So we're trying to squeeze in a

wild line over this shot of Noelle.

46.

Melissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has

just done or said.

MELISSA

What's the line?

GAVIN

(quickly)

How could you...

MELISSA

Howkajew?

GAVIN

Yeah.

MELISSA

Howkajew. It sounds like kosher

drug paraphernalia. Like, come on

Shmuley! Have a toke on the

Howkajew.

GAVIN

I know. It's just for the test

screening.

MELISSA

They really think people won't get

it?

GAVIN

The dumb people might not.

MELISSA

I didn't think we were making the

show for dumb people.

A beat.

JUMP CUT TO:

Melissa holds a microphone.

As video footage plays back, we hear three evenly-spaced

LOOPING BEEPS. Where the fourth one would be, Melissa says

the line.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

Howkajew...

(again)

How could you...

(again)

How couldjew...

Finished, she hands the mic back to Gavin.

47.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

I feel so dirty.

GAVIN

That's how I like ya.

223-226                                                                           223-226

GAVIN

That guy's looking at me.

SUSAN

He can't see you.

MODERATOR

How about you? Did you feel it

was...

AGITATED MAN

It's not real.

MODERATOR

And what do you mean by that?

48.

AGITATED MAN

The show's not real. Why can't you

see that? Jesus! Are you fucking

blind?

(looking at the mirror)

You think you're above it all,

don't you? You are trapped here

with the rest of them, brother.

AGITATED MAN (CONT'D)

Get out.   Get out! Oblivio

accebit!

CUT TO:

229                                                                  229

GAVIN

The guy was crazy. Obviously. The

show is kinda twisted, and it just

flipped something in him.

PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.)

What did he say?

GAVIN

Oblivio accebit. It's Latin.

"Oblivion approaches."

PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.)

What do you think it means?

GAVIN

Other than the world is coming to

an end? "Oblivio" also means

forgetting, forgetfulness.

(jump cut)

I think that's what I'm going to

do. Forget it.

CUT TO:

49.

230                                                                                       230

SUSAN

Did you have a chance to look at

the cards yet?

GAVIN

From the screening?

MELISSA

Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink.

SAM (O.S.)

Woman, where's my cocktail!

MELISSA

(yelling back)

I'm a-comin!

(to Gavin)

I still love you most.

SUSAN

(continuing her thought)

People write stuff on the cards

they won't say in a focus group.

They get more specific.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Roger has this advice I always

remember.

(MORE)

50.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Forget about anyone who scores you

in the Twos and Threes. They'll

never like your show.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Instead, look for the Nines.

GAVIN

The Nines.

SUSAN

They're the one who think your show

is almost the best thing they've

ever seen. They get your vision.

They just want it to be even

better.

MELISSA

Round two is starting without you!

SUSAN

So you'll look at the cards?

GAVIN

Absolutely.

LOOK FOR THE NINES

CUT TO:

232                                                                   232

SUSAN

Sometimes the numbers point things

out that you don't want to admit to

yourself. In this case, Melissa.

51.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Her overall scores were okay. But

if you look at the people who

scored the show highest, the one

consistent dip was Melissa.

CUT TO:

233                                                           233

GAVIN

She doesn't have a ton to do in the

pilot. There's so much to set up,

you don't get a lot of Melissa-

time.

SUSAN

True. That's one of the challenges

with a premise pilot.

GAVIN

But the network still likes the

show?

SUSAN

Of course. Roger is your biggest

cheerleader.

GAVIN

How about above Roger?

SUSAN

Roger calls the shots.

GAVIN

After he consults with the Higher

Powers.

SUSAN

True.

GAVIN

Do they like the show?

SUSAN

They haven't seen it. They're

watching all the pilots on Friday.

GAVIN

Why are you focusing on Melissa?

52.

SUSAN

Because she's the biggest concern.

GAVIN

She's also the biggest star in the

show.

SUSAN

No, you're the biggest star. Roger

made a huge deal with you, and he

went along with casting Melissa

when that wasn't his instinct.

GAVIN

Well, hooray for Roger. I don't

understand what you want me to do.

SUSAN

Meet with someone.

GAVIN

Who?

SUSAN

Dahlia Salem.

Gavin drops his fork so that it will CLATTER on his plate.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

The network has a holding deal with

her.

GAVIN

Yes. And you put her in Gatin's

pilot.

SUSAN

It's dead. It's dying. But the

network loves Dahlia. So if she

could jump over to your show...

GAVIN

Replace Melissa and reshoot the

pilot.

SUSAN

Roger would pay for it.

Gavin is nauseous.   He has to take a drink to be able to

speak.

GAVIN

So is this even about Melissa?

53.

SUSAN

It's about getting your show on the

air. That's all that matters in

the end.

CUT TO:

234                                                                                                 234

235                                                                                                 235

GAVIN

I see why the network loves her.

It's just, I wrote the part for

Melissa. She's one of my best

friends. And in my head, I only

see Melissa for the role.

(jump cut)

Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely.

It could work. I just don't know

if I want it to work.

237                                                                                                 237

238                                                                                                 238

GAVIN

When I get stressed out, I play

videogames. It's my therapy. I

can't have them on my own computer,

because then I'd never write. So I

come down to Koreatown.

(jump cut)

(MORE)

54.

GAVIN (CONT'D)

Videogames are better than real

life. When you get stuck, you can

always hit `reset.' Life needs a

reset button.

239                                                                  239

GAVIN

If we're really going to replace

Melissa, I want to hear it from

Roger.

240                                                                  240

SUSAN

Roger's on a flight to London. But

I talked with him before he left.

He said yes on Dahlia.

GAVIN

What does that mean?

SUSAN

It means yes.

GAVIN

Yes, replace Melissa?

SUSAN

He wants your show on the air,

starring Dahlia. I just got off

the phone with her agents. They

love it. She loves you.

GAVIN

What about Melissa?

SUSAN

You want me to call her agents?

GAVIN

God no.    I'll tell her.

55.

MELISSA

As long as he needs me, I know where I

must be...

MELISSA (CONT'D)

In-between the pilot and the

series, I'm trying to squeeze in a

one-woman show.

(edit)

I've always been obsessed with

nuns. They're sort of like God's

fag-hags.

CUT TO:

243                                                                 243

GAVIN

I think my house is haunted.

MELISSA

Your house is really old.

GAVIN

1926. Ever since I got back, I

feel like there's someone else

there. And then last night, I

thought I heard something. A woman

singing.

MELISSA

Shit.   Like a ghost?

56.

GAVIN

I guess. And then I saw something.

I ran into someone.

MELISSA

The woman?

GAVIN

It was a man. I think it was me.

A beat while Melissa processes.

MELISSA

Your house is haunted by yourself?

GAVIN

Yeah.

MELISSA

Gavin, are you alright?

GAVIN

No.    No.

He takes a long beat, psyching himself up.    What spills out

is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed.

GAVIN (CONT'D)

The network wants to replace you.

MELISSA

Oh my God.

GAVIN

And I'm letting them, because I

really want the show on the air. I

have all these characters inside my

head, and they want to live. I'm

the only way they can. This is the

only way they can. I have five

seasons mapped out, and though it

sucks, either you go away, or the

show goes. I had to make a

decision, and that's the decision I

made. I'm sorry.

By the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice.

Melissa takes a beat to process.

MELISSA

So it's done. Finished.   Decided.

GAVIN

Yes.

57.

MELISSA

I understand. It's not your fault.

You're morally incapable of doing

the right thing.

Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

Don't get me wrong. I think you do

feel bad for me. But that's all

you feel for me. You still see me

as the fat girl you call on Friday

night when a date falls through.

Let's go to a movie! Let's go to

Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece

of ass, don't worry about Melissa,

you can apologize tomorrow. Or

don't! Same difference. It's not

like we're actually friends.

GAVIN

I don't want to do this on camera.

MELISSA

No, because you can't control it.

Your little puppets are off their

strings, running around. Saying

things you didn't write. Reality

terrifies you.

GAVIN

Reality.

MELISSA

Yes.

GAVIN

The reality is, you would not be

here without me. I gave you your

first few roles. And your career

is a result of that.

With exaggerated relief...

MELISSA

God, thank you. Thank you for

finally playing that card. I

always knew you were holding onto

it, the "I invented Melissa

McCarthy card." Congratulations,

you win. The game is over.

She gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to

say:

Don't you ever pity me again.

GAVIN

Sort of like, "Here's our new shit.

Like it?"

(edit)

Upfronts is a complete oxymoron,

because no one is remotely honest.

SUSAN

The schedule is a secret until it's

announced, so everything is still

It's surreal being here. None of

this is how I planned it.

Hey you!

WOMAN'S VOICE

God.    Hi.    Gavin.

DAHLIA

You're doing your...show.

GAVIN

Get on. Come join reality

television.

GAVIN (CONT'D)

When did you get in?

60.

DAHLIA

Just now. This whole last 24 hours

has been surreal.

GAVIN

I just said surreal.

DAHLIA

You're good? I wanted to call you.

GAVIN

Please.   Call anytime.   I don't

sleep.

DAHLIA

I just felt weird about what

happened.

GAVIN

Did something happen?

GAVIN

So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem,

star of my show...

GAVIN (CONT'D)

... who tells me Gatin's show got

picked up, so no, she won't be in

my show, which makes me wonder,

does my show even exist?

GAVIN (CONT'D)

No, I've left word with Roger.

I've left word with Susan. It's

like they've dropped off the face

of the Earth.

61.

253                                                                    253

SUSAN (PRE-LAP)

Right now, the whole schedule's in

flux. You get these missives from

Roger and the Higher Powers...

SUSAN (CONT'D)

...but you're not sure what they

add up to. Right now, I can't say

for certain whether Knowing will

end up on the schedule at all.

GATINS

Look,   I'm sorry. But I'm kind of

not.    I want my show on the air.

And I   think it was shitty for you

to go   after Dahlia behind my back.

GAVIN

I heard your show was gone.

GATINS

I "heard" you fired Melissa

McCarthy without having a backup.

Why would they pick up your show

when you don't have a star?

GAVIN

The network wanted Dahlia.

GATINS

Yeah, in my show. We tested right

before you. Our numbers were

through the roof.

GAVIN

Really.

62.

GATINS

Really.   Who's your exec?

GAVIN

Susan Howard.

GATINS

She would know. She was there.

Ask her.

255                                                                255

SUSAN

(on phone)

I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did

you   hear about Ricky's assistant?

She   literally shat herself. No, I

saw   it.

GAVIN

I will break your fucking finger.

SUSAN

(to phone)

I'll call you back.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Roger wanted to talk to you

personally.

GAVIN

Bullshit.

SUSAN

They're only picking up two dramas.

GAVIN

The rest is, what, reality?

SUSAN

You can go mid-season.

63.

GAVIN

You can go to Hell.

SUSAN

Wow.

She takes a beat, trying to size him up.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

You think I deliberately sabotaged

your show.

GAVIN

Didn't you?

SUSAN

G., I'm on your side. Trust me,

I'm the only one who is trying to

protect you.

GAVIN                           SUSAN

Protect me from what?   You?    There is so much more going

You are psychotic.              on than you...

GAVIN

All I want to know is why.

SUSAN

You want a motive?

GAVIN

Yes.

SUSAN

This isn't "Crime Lab."   No one got

murdered.

GAVIN

My show did. So tell me why.

SUSAN

I had to get you away from her.

She was holding you back.

GAVIN

Melissa.

SUSAN

You had to give her up.

(beat)

C'mon, G. If she really mattered,

you couldn't have betrayed her so

easily.

GAVIN

I didn't.

64.

SUSAN

What, you're the victim? The big

Creator can't stand up to one

little d-girl? It was your choice.

I didn't make you do anything. I

mean, do you have any principles?

Do you believe in anything but your

own ego?

GAVIN

Fuck you.

SUSAN

Your dialogue used to be sharper.

Maybe Gatins could do a polish.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Is that all there is?

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Do you feel like a man? Because

I'll tell you a secret.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

(whisper)

You're not.

GAVIN

Look, I don't want to do this

anymore. My show's not going to

happen, so this show is over.

65.

GAVIN (CONT'D)

Done. Gone. I`m not going to be

your fucking puppet.

OFF-SCREEN VOICE

Are you alright?

Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting

for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the

streetwalker from Part One.)

GAVIN

I'm fine.

OCTAVIA

Who were you talking to?

Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.

MUCH WIDER

We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera

Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably

perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?

Was there ever anyone there?

Our CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky,

we're smooth and slow.

The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of

creeping dread.

We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little

unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.

Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her

head:

A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.

WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind

of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to

see the lights other than Gavin.

Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just

landed on an alien world.

A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.

He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same

sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.

Blinding.

GAVIN

Oh God.

66.

We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind

Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing

ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by

moment.

A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...

Exit Now?

INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [PART ONE]

We're continuing an earlier scene from the end of Part One.

MARGARET

I can understand why you're a

little confused.

GARY

No.   I'm a lot confused.

MARGARET

Theories?

GARY

This is all a dream.

MARGARET

No.

GARY

I'm in a coma.

MARGARET

(amused)

No.

GARY

Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or

Purgatorium or something.

67.

MARGARET

Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans

vomited. But no. This is as real

as anything can be.

GARY

(suspicious)

What does that mean?

She sits forward in her chair.   By instinct, he sits back.

MARGARET

Everything is what it is. But

you're not who you think you are.

GARY

Okay, then. Who am I?

With practiced calm...

MARGARET

You're a multi-dimensional being of

vast, almost infinite power. You

created this world on a whim, and

decided to stick around to see how

it turned out. You, this body

you're in, is just one of your

incarnations. Avatars. Call you

what you will.

Not sure he follows...

GARY

Are you saying I'm God?

MARGARET

Technically, no. If God is a ten --

a theoretical ultimate, that-which-

no-greater-can-be-imagined --

you're more of a nine.

GARY

So what are you?

MARGARET

Humans are sevens. Monkeys are

sixes.

GARY

What are the eights?

MARGARET

Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus,

they control the weather.

She didn't mean to get on that tangent...

68.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

What's important is that you,

you're the big cheese. El Supremo.

You could destroy the world with a

single thought.

(suddenly)

Don't, incidentally. Just file

that away. But the truth is, you

hold all the cards: every church,

every candle, every sacrifice --

that's for you. When people pray,

they're not praying because they

want this thing or that thing.

They just don't want to be

forgotten.

MARGARET (CONT'D)

So you understand, I would have

told you earlier, but I didn't...

GARY

Yeah.

MARGARET

Okay.

GARY

I understand. But I don't believe

you.

He gets up to exit. (This is where we jump-cut time earlier.)

FREEZE FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK.

GABRIEL

Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.

MARY

No.   You had ice cream at lunch.

GABRIEL

(to Mary)

Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't

count.

MARY

I'll make note.

302                                                                    302

MARY

Did you hit it?

GABRIEL

Shouldn't have to.

70.

He fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote

entry button repeatedly.

Gabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even

Noelle knows something's wrong.

Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob.

Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and

Noelle.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

I think we left the overhead light

on.

He taps it.   Moves the switch.

MARY

Shit.

Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit."

MARY (CONT'D)

Noelle.

Gabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits "START."

Nothing.

GABRIEL

Battery is dead. Least the starter

is.

Noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.

MARY

How do we...?

GABRIEL

We call the service.     That's all we

can do.

MARY

It's just the little battery that's

dead, right? The big one is

probably fine.

GABRIEL

I guess.

MARY

We can't jump it from one battery

to the other? Cross-over somehow?

GABRIEL

Who did you marry?      MacGyver?

71.

He gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. Mary

follows him out. Noticing that he's not dialing...

MARY

Are you getting a signal?

GABRIEL

No.    Do you?

She checks her phone.    A long beat.

MARY

Yes!     One bar.

They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,

Gabriel takes the phone and dials.

It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string

bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.

In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window.   She signs,

asking if everything is okay.

MARY (CONT'D)

We're okay. Daddy's calling people

to help us.

Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear.   Looks at the screen.

Hits redial. Fuck.

GABRIEL

The minute you try to place a call,

the bar goes away.

MARY

Keep trying.

GABRIEL

Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But

it will keep happening.

MARY

Well, what do you want to do?

GABRIEL

I don't know.

He tries redial.

MARY

Maybe if you hold it up higher.

Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length.   No good.

72.

GABRIEL

The problem is we're boxed in.

It's a canyon.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

Where we turned off the main road,

it was more open. And higher, too.

MARY

That's at least a mile.

GABRIEL

I can run that.

MARY

So...we stay here?

GABRIEL

You okay with that?

MARY

I don't think we have a choice, so,

yeah. Go.

GABRIEL

Daddy's going to get a truck to

help us out. You take care of your

mom, okay?

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

I'll be right back.

GABRIEL

Excuse me!     Hi! Hello?

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

Excuse me.     Do you have a cell

phone?

SIERRA

No, I don't. There's no service up

here.

GABRIEL

(re: his phone)

Yeah, I'm finding that out.

SIERRA

You can usually get a signal up at

the ranger station.

GABRIEL

Okay...

74.

SIERRA

You follow the road. It's

probably... I don't know. You have

a car?

GABRIEL

It's dead.     That's why I need...

SIERRA

Oh...

She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him

noticing her.

GABRIEL

Yeah.

A beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the

road.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

Are you headed back to your car

now? If you could give me a ride

to a gas station, wherever...

She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat

for Gabriel to figure out why.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy

Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to

rape you or kill you or anything.

She doesn't seem reassured.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

Of course, that's what Ted Bundy

would say. Look, I'm a videogame

designer.

(fishing through wallet)

My wife is an editor. My daughter

is four.

He offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't

take it.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

They're waiting back at the car,

and I want to get some help before

it gets dark.

SIERRA

I can call somebody when I get to

town.

Trying to temper his frustration...

75.

GABRIEL

I believe you. I do. But you

don't know where the car is. And

the guy might not come. We can't

be up here all night.

SIERRA

I'm sorry.

GABRIEL

Don't be sorry. Just help me out

here.

SIERRA

No.   I can't. I'm sorry.

GABRIEL

Why won't you trust me?

TRANSITION TO:

306                                                                   306

MARY

Okay, but you have to be careful,

understand? You have to use Big

Girl hands.

MARY (CONT'D)

Do you want to see where we were

today?

76.

MARY (CONT'D)

Okay, now hit play. This button.

MARY (CONT'D)

There's you. And there's Daddy.

You're a little movie star, huh?

MARY (CONT'D)

He'll be back soon. Don't you

worry.

CUT TO:

307                                                                  307

SIERRA (O.S.)

Hey!

GABRIEL

Were you following me?

SIERRA

Once I was sure you weren't

following me. I'm sorry, it's

just...

GABRIEL

You thought I was Ted Bundy.

SIERRA

Kinda.

GABRIEL

My name's Gabriel.   Bundy.

SIERRA

Sierra.

SIERRA (CONT'D)

Weird that there's no cars.    At

all.

77.

GABRIEL

Yeah.

SIERRA

So, listen. I'm parked that way.

SIERRA (CONT'D)

It's not that far. If you want,

I'll give you a ride to town.

GABRIEL

Really?

SIERRA

Yeah.   Make up some karma.

GABRIEL

Lead the way.

TRANSITION TO:

308                                                                      308

SIERRA

Okay, confession.    I kind of

recognized you.

GABRIEL

Really?

SIERRA

I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a

picture of you in some videogame

magazine my boyfriend had. You're,

like, the shit.

GABRIEL

No.

SIERRA

You're like the Quentin Tarantino

of that world. A videogame God.

GABRIEL

Not really.

78.

SIERRA

Fine.

GABRIEL

You seriously recognized me off of

one photo?

SIERRA

I thought you were kinda hot.

Considering.

GABRIEL

Considering..?

SIERRA

Within the subset of videogame

people.

GABRIEL

Okay.

SIERRA

I wasn't masturbating to your

picture or anything.

GABRIEL

Well, I guess I'm flattered.

SIERRA

You should be. I'm stingy with

compliments.

GABRIEL

So your boyfriend plays videogames?

SIERRA

Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too

many. He used to play Evercrack

back in the day, but yours, well,

that was like...what's worse than

crack?

GABRIEL

Super-crack?

SIERRA

Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor

guy.

GABRIEL

Shaman?

SIERRA

Yeah. At one point he was spending

like, 40 hours a week gathering

"thunderleaf" or whatever.

(MORE)

79.

SIERRA (CONT'D)

Then I was his mule, hauling it

around because he ran out of space.

GABRIEL

You had an account?

SIERRA

I was part of your world, and you

didn't even know it.

GABRIEL

Sorry.

SIERRA

You can make it up to me.

309                                                                   309

MAN'S VOICE

...I have five seasons mapped out,

and though it sucks, either you go

away, or the show goes. I had to

make a decision, and that's the

decision I made. I'm sorry.

MELISSA (ON TAPE)

So it's done. Finished. Decided.

GAVIN (ON TAPE)

Yeah.

MELISSA (ON TAPE)

I understand.

80.

GAVIN (ON TAPE)

You do?

MELISSA (ON TAPE)

I understand. It's not your fault.

You're morally incapable of doing

the right thing.

CUT TO:

SIERRA

So you play a lot of characters at

once?

GABRIEL

A couple.    Most people do.

SIERRA

You're not most people. You

created the world. You know all

the secret codes.

GABRIEL

What, like `God mode'?

SIERRA

That's what you call it?

GABRIEL

That's when you have all the

powers, and you can't be killed.

It's fine when you're designing,

but it's really boring to play. A

game isn't fun unless there are

rules.

SIERRA

And you make the rules.

GABRIEL

Yes I do. I mean, you want to give

everyone freedom, but they can't

handle it. Half your players are

teenage boys, and it's like they're

programmed to be destructive.

(MORE)

81.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

They deliberately crash the world

servers. They'd ruin everything

just to prove they could.

INT.   FOREST VALE - DAY

Sarah offers Gary her water bottle, which he gladly takes.

Out of nowhere...

SIERRA

Do you think I'm pretty?

She stops, turning to face him.

GABRIEL

What?

SIERRA

Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely

physical level.

GABRIEL

Sure.

He drinks.

SIERRA

That's a rave.

GABRIEL

Well, I don't know why you're

asking.

SIERRA

My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says,

"What I like about you is that

you're not so hot that I'm afraid

of losing you."

GABRIEL

So where's the orc now?

SIERRA

He's dead. I spiked his water

bottle with a massive quantity of

GHB. He hallucinated, went into

convulsions and died.

He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back.

GABRIEL

Remind me not to piss you off,

Sarah.

82.

SIERRA

Sierra.

GABRIEL

Sorry.

SIERRA

And what makes you think you

haven't pissed me off already?

311                                                                      311

MARY

How are you doing, kiddo?

MARY (CONT'D)

I was thinking we could all go to

El Cholo for dinner. How would you

feel about some blue corn

enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy

when he gets back?

NOELLE

He's not coming back.

MARY

How could you...

MELISSA (ON TAPE)

Howkajew. How could you. How

could you.

(MORE)

83.

MELISSA (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)

I feel so dirty.

That's how I like ya.

GABRIEL

Am I crazy, or is it getting

hotter?

SIERRA

Oh, you're crazy.

GABRIEL

I have a wife. And a daughter.

They're waiting for me.

SIERRA

Where are they?

84.

GABRIEL

Back at the car.

SIERRA

I mean, which direction?

GABRIEL

They're back...

SIERRA

Face it, G.: You don't know where

they are. You don't know where you

are. We've been walking in circles

for an hour.

GABRIEL

Where's your car?

SIERRA

There is no car. That was all a...

(what's the word)

"pretense," I guess. An excuse to

get you alone.

SIERRA (CONT'D)

Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the

GHB. In the water.

FLASH TO:

GABRIEL

What's happening?

SIERRA

I'm sorry it had to come this, G.

But it'll all be over soon.

85.

GABRIEL

You're trying to kill me.

SIERRA

No! No. This isn't a murder.

It's an intervention.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

I had to get you away from her. She

was holding you back. You had to

give her up.

GAVIN

Melissa?

SARAH

I can you out of here.    But you

have to trust me.

SUSAN

Do you feel like a man?   You're

not.

SIERRA

That's right. Just let it go.       Let

it go.

GABRIEL

Why are you doing this?

SIERRA

You did it to yourself.   Admitting

that is the first step.

86.

They're Nines as well.

SIERRA (CONT'D)

You're a crack-head, G. The thing

is, this planet, these people,

they're your drug of choice.

INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

[The next sequence bridges multiple earlier scenes from Parts

One and Two. Gary/Gavin/Gabriel has one conversation with

Sarah/Susan/Sierra, but it's broken up among previous scenes

and locations, sometimes for just a line.]

S.

It's not that hard to make a

universe. At first, you just

checked in every once in a while.

See how the Neanderthals were

doing. Move some continents

around. But then you got more into

it. Starting playing a couple of

characters of your own. Kings.

Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,

you were playing 24/7.

G.

How long have I..?

S.

You've been gone for four thousand

years. Not that time means the

same for us, but...

G.

You came looking for me.

S.

That's what a girl does.

G.

Why now?

INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

S.

We couldn't just storm in on a

fiery chariot. It's your universe.

We had to play by your rules. We

had to make you see how limited and

corrupt your little world was.

Don't get me wrong, this world is

nice. It's cozy. But do you

remember where you came from?

A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build

in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.

G.

It was warm. And white.    Like...

EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY

Mary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her

mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her.

ON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177)

MARGARET

You could destroy the world with a

single thought.

(suddenly)

Don't, incidentally. Just file

that away. But the truth is, you

hold all the cards: every church,

every candle, every sacrifice --

that's for you. When people pray,

they're not praying because they

want this thing or that thing.

They just don't want to be

forgotten.

EXT.   ROAD / PRIUS - DAY

Mary is still watching the tape. She realizes Noelle isn't

watching over her shoulder anymore.

Mary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen.

MARY

Noelle?    Noelle!

EXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY

Gabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved

road meets the gravel road.

GABRIEL

Maybe if I just cut back, didn't

get so involved...

SIERRA

We both know that'll never work.

Next week, you'll be back here

redesigning the pinecones. You

have to quit cold-turkey.

GABRIEL

I can't.

89.

SIERRA

You can. But I can't force you to

leave. You have to want it.

She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string

bracelet around his wrist.

She kisses him.   And then she's gone.

Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his

decision.

EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY

Panicking, Mary calls out for --

MARY

Noelle!   Noelle!

She's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her...

GABRIEL

She's here.

Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding

his hand.

GABRIEL (CONT'D)

I didn't forget you guys.

Mary regards him as a familiar stranger, a beloved imposter.

MARY

Everything okay?

GABRIEL

Absolutely. Let's go home.

MUSIC BEGINS, a song that will carry us through the next

sequence.

319                                                                     319

INT.   PRIUS - DAY

Gabriel climbs into the driver's seat. Both Mary and Noelle

watch with interest as he pushes the "START" button. The car

BEEPS and engages without any problem.

Everyone fastens their seatbelts.

MARY

You need to go, don't you?

GABRIEL

No.   I can stay.

MARY

How long? Forever? Every day,

you'd know what you were missing.

MARY (CONT'D)

What happens? If you go.

GABRIEL

Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous

disintegration into a fiery void.

Oblivio accebit. The end of

everything.

MARY

That's all?

GABRIEL

That probably wouldn't happen. The

basic structure of the universe

should hold. I guess I'm just

worried about the human factor.

You guys kill each other a lot.

92.

MARY

In fairness, that's usually in your

name. Plus we've gotten much more

efficient at it.

A beat.

GABRIEL

I like this world. I like my life,

here, with you and Noelle...

MARY

But it's not real. I'm not really

your wife, you're not really my

husband. On some level, it's all

pretend.

GABRIEL

It's not pretend. There's a reason

you were there, in every version.

You were my sister, my wife, my

best friend...

MARY

That's a little creepy.

GABRIEL

I wanted you close. In one

version, I even told you. I warned

you that some day they might come

for me, and...

MARY

...You'd have to leave.   How many

versions were there?

GABRIEL

Ninety.   This is the last one.

MARY

Wow.

GABRIEL

I've destroyed billions of people

with a thought. Obliterated them.

And you'd like to think it's

painless...

MARY

Stop. You don't have to explain, or

apologize. Everything that is, is

because of you. If that's all,

that's enough.

With that, there's really nothing more to say.

93.

MARY (CONT'D)

So.

GABRIEL

So.

MARY

Guess you don't really need to pack

anything.

GABRIEL

I'm good.

MARY

You're great. It's been a

pleasure.

GABRIEL

Likewise.    I love you.

MARY

Love you, too. Ya big lug.

He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending

kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he

WHISPERS into her ear:

GABRIEL

You're my favorite.

She smiles.

With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet

around his left wrist.

And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary

between water and air.

He's stepped out of this dimension.

Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice

that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-

dimensional images.

She and everything around her has become like wallpaper,

slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.

Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.

The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that

ripple through the tissue-thin walls.

Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window,

heading west.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Honey, do we have nutmeg?

M

We should.

BEN

Cinnamon, too.

95.

M catches her reflection in the toaster.   Notices she looks

different than she expected.

NOELLE

(to Ben)

If I had a horse...

Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at

a time.

NOELLE (CONT'D)

I would name her Cinnamon.

BEN

Really.

NOELLE

And if I had another horse...

BEN

Nutmeg?

NOELLE

No, Flash.

M

Sweetie?

She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair.

Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:

M  (CONT'D)

This is going to sound really

strange, but...what's my name?

Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look.

NOELLE

Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.

Noelle smiles.   M smiles too, a little embarrassed.

M

Right.    Exactly.

Noelle looks her right in the eye.

NOELLE

He's not coming back. But it's

gonna be okay. He put the pieces

together, it's like...

M

The best of all possible worlds.

Noelle taps her nose.

96.

BEN

Honey? Is it supposed to stick

like this?

Sharing a look...

M

We should help him.

Noelle agrees.   They head over to assist.

We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes,

Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be.

We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey

pancakes, and a good life.

FADE OUT.

THE END

97.

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S

and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to

shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that

involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.

So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be

intercutting the best of all these moments to create one

sequence.

99                                                                    99

INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS

S.

It's not that hard to make a

universe. At first, you just

checked in every once in a while.

See how the Neanderthals were

doing. Move some continents

around. But then you got more into

it. Starting playing a couple of

characters of your own. Kings.

Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,

you were playing 24/7.

G.

How long have I..?

S.

You've been gone for four thousand

years. Not that time means the

same for us, but...

G.

You came looking for me.

S.

That's what a girl does.

G.

Why now?

S.

We couldn't just storm in on a

fiery chariot. It's your universe.

We had to play by your rules. We

had to make you see how limited and

corrupt your little world was.

Don't get me wrong, this world is

nice. It's cozy. But do you

remember where you came from?

A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build

in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.

98.

G.

It was warm. And white.   Like...

S.

You can't describe it with human

words. You can't think it with

human thoughts.

(beat)

That's why you have to come back.

Come back with us. With me.
