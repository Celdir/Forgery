SHOOTING DRAFT

1975

DOORMAN

Morning, folks. Can I help you?

KRESIMIR

Yes, please. I... er, we... are

looking for the rental agent here.

We have an appointment.

DOORMAN

OK, I'll just give him a little buzz

and he'll come out and show you the

way in.

DOORMAN

(freeing holster)

Darned thing.

BENDA

Do you ever use that?

DOORMAN

This? No, never even had it out of

the holster. A rival company has

'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an

advertising gimmick.

DOORMAN

Here's Mr. Merrick. He'll take you

on in.

MERRICK

(ingratiatingly)

Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you

are...?

KRESIMIR

Kresimir and Benda Sviben.

MERRICK

Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs.

Sweden. Come right this way. Sorry

to keep you waiting. Now, are we

talking about one or two bedrooms? I

assume we're not talking about

bachelors, eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have

several floor plans all laid out for

you, and all you have to do is take

your choice and we'll trot right on

up there and take a look at 'em...

MERRICK

Now you take a look at that one,

Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't

suit you down to the ground. That

one has the big view, the panoramic

view...

JANINE (V.O.)

Breakfast is just about ready, Nick.

JANINE

Can I call you at the office?

TUDOR

What do you want to call me at the

office for?

JANINE

I don't know. I just thought I might

want to call you. I don't know.

TUDOR

I won't be at the office except to

sign in.

(he eats heartily,

not looking directly

at Janine)

I've got a lot of claims to check

out. All over the place. Garages and

more garages.

(noticing Janine's

silence, he finally

looks up)

I'll come home right after work.

MERRICK

We're going up.

TUDOR

Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride.

MERRICK

(after a pause, to

the Svibens,

indicating the

elevator)

Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent,

fireproof, fast, cushioned ride.

Everything you could want in an

elevator.

MERRICK (V.O.)

Notice how the entranceways to all

the apartments are recessed and

individually lit... Nope, it's down

that way, Brenda. That's it...

Recessed and individually lit...

SUPER (V.O.)

Like I said to the police officer,

he paid the rent, Dr. Hobbes did.

And he came around and chatted a lot

with everyone here, the staff, I

mean. Nice guy. Not a high and mighty

type. But it was her name on the

residency list and the buzzer board:

Annabelle... what was it again?...

Annabelle Horsefield. She never

complained about anything, not to

me, anyway.

DETECTIVE

(pointing to

Annabelle's corpse,

which is just being

carried out the door)

And that was her. Annabelle Horse...

field.

SUPER

Far as I know, yeah, that was her.

DETECTIVE

Is that the man who called you up

here?

SUPER

Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the

head of our little medical clinic

here.

DETECTIVE

Medical clinic?

SUPER

Yeah. This is an island, you know?

Takes too long to get into the city.

We gotta have everything right here

or somebody complains.

DETECTIVE

Well, let's go talk to your doctor.

DETECTIVE

Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant

Heller. I'd like to ask you a few

questions.

ST. LUC

(obviously a bit dazed

by what he has been

seeing)

Sure.

DETECTIVE

You're the one who found the bodies?

ST. LUC

Yes.

DETECTIVE

Did you touch anything? Move anything

before we got here?

ST. LUC

No, nothing.

DETECTIVE

You knew these people?

ST. LUC

I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor

and a professor at university. I saw

the girl around the building but I

didn't know her. She never came to

the clinic.

DETECTIVE

So you just came up to visit this

Hobbes and you found them like that?

ST. LUC

Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes

since I was in medical school. He

taught me... he was my prof in urology

and... I think he conducted a few

seminars in psychopharmacology. That

was it. I had no idea he'd ever set

foot in Starliner Towers until today.

DETECTIVE

I see. Then what brought you up here?

ST. LUC

It was very strange. He called me at

six this morning. Hobbes called me.

I thought I was dreaming. I haven't

heard that voice for so long. He

told me who it was, then he said

something like, 'Meet me at apartment

1208 at noon. I want you to go out

for lunch with me. It's time you

furthered your education.' Then he

laughed and hung up. I went back to

sleep. He called me again at eight

to remind me to come.

DETECTIVE

How did he sound this time? Was he

nervous? Depressed?

ST. LUC

He sounded fine.

SUPER

(pause)

Who? No, that's not me. You got the

wrong guy. Just a sec.

(looks up at St. Luc

and holds out the

phone to him)

It's for you. Somebody wants to know

how come you didn't show up for lunch.

ROLLO

Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes

would have laid on you, Rog, but

it's all I got, and...

(places hand on heart,

leans over

confidentially)

...all I got I share with you. Go

ahead. Take all you want.

ST. LUC

You touch my spleen, Rollo.

(they giggle at an

old medical-school

reference)

And here all the time I was thinking --

if I ever bothered to think about

the good old days -- well, at least

there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's

happy.

ROLLO

I'm still a VD man under the skin,

Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth

kinda guy, right?

ST. LUC

Well, at least you still talk the

same.

ROLLO

So who changes?

ST. LUC

But you gave up your private practice.

Suddenly you're into pure research

and you... you're what, a

parasitologist?

ROLLO

That was my father's idea... private

practice. He wanted to set me up --

I couldn't say no. But he's dead

now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I

gotta do research. Look at that

beautiful stuff...

(gestures everywhere)

...lookit it!

ROLLO

(with great enthusiasm,

indicating the entire

lab)

This is the 'Satyr's Tongue'!

ROLLO

The note includes a warning against

swallowing the tongue whole, but we

don't see the rest of this caution.

'Satyr's Tongue' was Hobbes's code

name for our project. What we were

trying to do was to find an

alternative to organ transplants.

ROLLO

I know. You're bored already.

Transplants are yesterday's kishkas,

right?

ST. LUC

(shaking his head in

protest)

Did I say anything?

ROLLO

(excited, waving

specimens of parasites

and diseased organs

around)

Look. You got men, you got parasites

that live in, on, and around men.

Now. Why not breed a parasite that

does something useful? Eh? Why not

breed a parasite capable of taking

over the function of any one of a

bunch of human organs? Why not, for

example, a parasite living in the

human abdominal cavity that plugs

into the circulatory system and

filters the blood like a kidney? If

it takes a little blood for itself,

so what? Be generous! You can afford

it.

ROLLO

You put the bug into the body of a

man with a diseased kidney, the bug

attacks the bad kidney, dissolves

it, it's assimilated by the body,

and now you got a perfectly good

parasite where you used to have a

rotten kidney. I know what you're

gonna say. You're gonna say it's

crazy.

ST. LUC

(laughing)

It's crazy.

ROLLO

Right. It's crazy. But here's the

beauty part. Ready?

(leans forward for

emphasis)

Who cares?

ST. LUC

I don't get it.

ROLLO

You know and I know that Hobbes was

a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry,

academic, afraid of women, lousy.

But he was always a genius at one

thing -- getting grants. Could he

get grants for crazy projects?

ROLLO

You know who pays the rent here? Eh?

The Northern Hemisphere Organ

Transplant Society. And that's for

something that's supposed to put

them outta business. And they're not

the only ones. We got grant money

coming out of our ears.

ROLLO

See? There? You take a little of

this... that's a very rare venereal

disease you get in the nomadic Crinua

people, Northeast Asia and Japan.

(points to a sexy

picture of a Japanese

lady in heat)

Oo. That one's got it bad. They call

it Batinh. That means 'kiss' or

'caress.' When you get it it makes

your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss

everything. I even had it once. I

always get everything at least once

so I know what the patient's talking

about.

(he laughs but he's

serious)

And there... you take a little of

that... that's beautiful, isn't it?

That's Flexipes, the world's only

cephalopod parasite.

(indicating the jar)

That's him right there. Not a very

good specimen. Related to squids and

octopuses. See? He lives in the guts

of whales and big dolphins.

(wiggles a finger at

the specimen)

Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't

ya? Yeah.

ROLLO

We don't do it all here, we send out

to have tricky stuff done... the

cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal

fission, all that fancy close work.

ST. LUC

Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself?

ROLLO

(shrugging)

Funny in the head. High suicide rate

in the medical profession. Too much

body, alla time bodies, bodies.

ROLLO

Rog, I gotta talk serious to you.

Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I

want you to come into this with me.

To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm

lonely.

(begins to pace around

again)

All Hobbes ever did was run around

getting money and phone me in the

middle of the night. He wanted you

in anyway. That's why we were gonna

get together, the three of us. We

would have enough to keep us going

for at least five years, even with

inflation.

ST. LUC

(a bit uncomfortable

being put on the

spot)

Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always

a GP.

ROLLO

(almost angrily)

You want to help sick people for the

rest of your life? God forbid I should

talk you out of it.

ST. LUC

You oughta be careful yourself. Might

end up cutting your throat.

ROLLO

It was women did it to Hobbes.

Couldn't handle them. That girl,

that Annabelle -- talk about crazy

projects.

ST. LUC

Who was she?

ROLLO

(reluctant to talk)

Aw, he met her when he was lecturing

at some private girls' school. They

caught him examining her little tits

for breast cancer in the faculty

lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask.

It was craziness, believe me.

(indicating the

gynecological table)

They used to come here sometimes.

(shakes his head)

Don't ask.

ROLLO

I'll never really understand how he

could do what he did to her.

ST. LUC

Well, Rollo Linsky... I gotta go

open up the store. It's been great

to see you again.

ROLLO

Yeah, sure.

ROLLO

But you'll think about what I said

about working together, huh?

ST. LUC

OK. I'll think about it.

JANINE

You say something?

TUDOR

Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of

my hands. That's all.

JANINE

(after a pause)

You sure you're OK, Nick?

BETTS

...probably nothing at all. It's

probably just a bunch of, I don't

know, fatty cysts. You can have them

removed in a doctor's office. Has

Nick seen a doctor?

JANINE

He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers.

He never goes to doctors.

BETTS

Well, look. How's this? You go on

down to the clinic and tell that

nice Dr. St. Luc...

(pauses to work it

out)

...you tell him that Nick's ill,

he's got these lumps, and he can't

get out of bed. Tell him to come

when you're sure Nick'll be home.

And don't tell Nick anything. Let

the two of them fight it out.

JANINE

(not displeased with

the idea)

He'll be really mad.

BETTS

(with a conspiratorial

smile)

So? You'll find out what's wrong and

then you'll be able to relax a little

bit. Let him be the uptight one for

a change.

BETTS

(to Benda)

Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you

here before, have I?

MRS. WHEATLEY

Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals.

Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll

buzz him.

MRS. WHEATLEY

I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll

put you on 'hold' again and see if I

can find Mr. Tudor.

MRS. WHEATLEY

Nicholas? There's a call for you.

MRS. WHEATLEY

Nicholas? It's that man whose

Lamborghini caught fire on St.

Catherine Street and burned to the

ground. He's very angry...

MRS. WHEATLEY

Nicholas! What happened?

MRS. WHEATLEY

We're going to get you to a hospital.

That's what we're going to do.

TUDOR

(beginning to come

around)

No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all

right.

MRS. WHEATLEY

Do you see this? This is blood. It

came from your insides. That means

it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You

executives are all the same.

MRS. WHEATLEY

(smoothing the hair

back from Tudor's

forehead in a very

motherly fashion)

Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost

anything to be sure everything's all

right. I think you should definitely

go to the emergency ward and...

TUDOR

(abruptly, swiveling

away from Mrs.

Wheatley's hand)

Call me a cab, will you please, Mona?

I'm going home for the day.

MRS. WHEATLEY

Nicholas, I think...

TUDOR

I don't care what you think. Please

call me a cab. Now.

MRS. WHEATLEY

(mollifyingly)

All right, Nicholas. All right.

PARKINS

...and this Kriedler seems to think

that mega-vitamin therapy may be the

answer to the question of aging.

That's not to suggest that the aging

process is in any way reversible --

I don't think for a minute that it

is -- but it may be stoppable, and

that's where mega-vitamins come in...

JANINE

Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go.

DOORMAN

Afternoon, Mr. Tudor.

ST. LUC

Well, there's certainly nothing here

in this check-up I did for your

husband's company last year. Blood

pressure a touch high, cholesterol

count nice and low...

(looking Janine in

the eye)

I just can't see cancer developing

that fast, Janine, not the way you've

described it. Could be swollen glands

or something, I don't know.

JANINE

(a bit relieved but

still tense)

You'll come up and take a look at

him?

ST. LUC

(standing up)

If he can't make it down here...

sure. That's what I'm here for. But

it won't be until, oh...

(checking his watch)

...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late?

JANINE

That's great, Doctor. Thanks.

FORSYTHE

Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting,

Doctor.

ST. LUC

Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.

FORSYTHE

I'm ready for you now, Brad.

FORSYTHE

Now, you just take off all your

clothes, put this on, and hop up on

to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll

be in to see you in a few minutes.

PARKINS

(as Forsythe begins

to leave)

You don't have to go. I'm not shy.

FORSYTHE

Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still

working, you know.

FIRST LADY

(examining the bloodied

umbrella)

Aw. Poor birdie. They're always

crashing into tall buildings. It's

such a shame, such a shame. The

windows fool them, you know.

COMPANION

Come along, Olive.

FIRST LADY

Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just

been hurt. Maybe we should look for

him!

COMPANION

(pulling Olive along)

Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven

now, whatever it is. Won't help at

all for you to get into a fuss and

muddle over it. Now come along and

let's finish up our little evening

stroll and get you tucked up in bed

in front of the color TV.

COMPANION

You know what a restless night you

have if you don't get your two hours

of color TV, dear, so let's bustle

along and get our walk over with,

shall we...?

PARKINS

Ow! Better take it easy. There's a

lot of pressure in there!

PARKINS

Want me to breathe deeply?

ST. LUC

Just breathe normally.

PARKINS

(confidentially)

Good shape for an old man, eh?

ST. LUC

(after a pause)

Mr. Parkins, what makes you think

you caught these lumps of yours from

a young lady?

PARKINS

She had a couple just like them.

Right here near her belly button.

You could push 'em around. I thought

they were kinda sexy, myself.

ST. LUC

Didn't she ever have these lumps

looked at by a doctor?

PARKINS

(shrugs)

Didn't seem worried about them.

ST. LUC

Was this girl from Starliner Towers?

PARKINS

Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually

went to my place. Bigger liquor

cabinet, bigger bed.

(chuckles, then gets

serious)

She was gone when I got back from my

last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a

beautiful tan.

(smiles again)

Must have gone home to mother.

ST. LUC

Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?

PARKINS

That's the one.

ST. LUC

OK, you can get dressed now, Mr.

Parkins.

ST. LUC

(handing Parkins a

slip of paper)

I'm going to send you to the hospital

to have a few X-rays taken. I want

to find out exactly what you're hiding

in there, OK? Give them this. The

address is right there under

Radiology.

PARKINS

Gonna cut me open?

ST. LUC

Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

PARKINS

Used to know a doctor who said he

got to know his patients better than

their wives did.

(chuckles)

Cutting a man open sure does expose

more of him than pulling down his

pants, gotta admit that.

JANINE

Hi.

BETTS

Hi. Want a drink?

JANINE

No thanks. Just wanted to tell you

that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see

Nick at ten or so.

BETTS

Was he nice to you?

BETTS

Good. Well...

(takes a sip from a

glass on the floor

next to her)

I've ordered in some vrai cuisine

francaise from Jean-Phillipe at the

Cote d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in

garlic butter... the works. They

have lovely strong delivery boys who

fight their way through sleet and

hail and the gloom of night just to

bring me my coq au vin. And after

Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's

nothing wrong with Nick that a

vacation won't cure, and if Nick

falls asleep early again, you just

come on back here for company and a

late supper. You hear me?

BETTS

Now, I mean it. I always order enough

for two and I'll just get fat and

lonely if you don't show up.

GIRL

C'mon, let's smoke one of the

cigarettes right now. Your father'll

never miss it.

BOY

I can't, dummy. He'll see that the

pack's been opened. You're such a

dumbhead.

GIRL

OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the

store and buy my own pack and smoke

'em all myself.

BOY

Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?

GIRL

(flipping open a milk

box)

With some milk jugs I just happened

to pick up on the way home.

BOY

I dunno. Guess the milk went bad.

(shrugs)

It's still worth money.

GIRL

Jesus!

BOY

Let's get outta here before somebody

hears us!

TUDOR

(delirious, voice

strained, whispering)

Come here, boy. Here, boy, here.

TUDOR

Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and

me, we're gonna be friends, aren't

we?

TUDOR

No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm

not going to hurt you. Not going to

hurt you. We're going to be friends.

Friends.

TUDOR

(soothingly)

Attaboy.

(closing his eyes in

bliss and smiling

again)

Attaboy.

JANINE

Nick? I didn't know you were home.

What's wrong? What are you doing?

You're almost falling out of bed.

How are you feeling?

JANINE

(tenderly, but with

caution, as though

expecting a blow)

Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I

see those bumps on your tummy, can

I?

TUDOR

Go away. Leave me alone.

JANINE

(frustrated)

Oh, why won't you let me help you?

TUDOR

(murmuring)

Attaboy, attaboy.

ST. LUC

OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to

be fine. Now if it gives you any

trouble at all, any sharp pain, any

unusual discharge, you come and see

me right away. They can be tricky

sometimes.

FORSYTHE

(distributing papers)

OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you

wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor,

Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers

published by Hobbes, Linsky, and

Lefebvre in a couple of issues of

the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical

Association and also the Journal of

the American Medical Association.

And, as an added extra, a couple of

odds and ends from the files I helped

compile before your time here, Doctor.

I thought they might interest you.

ST. LUC

That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.

FORSYTHE

Do I get a kiss?

FORSYTHE

Kiss, kiss?

ST. LUC

Uh, OK. Sure.

FORSYTHE

Another kiss?

ST. LUC

C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more

on the list?

FORSYTHE

No. Dotty's the last.

ST. LUC

Yes?

ROLLO (V.O.)

That you, Rog?

ST. LUC

(not recognizing the

voice)

Yes?

ROLLO (V.O.)

It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?

ST. LUC

Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking

about you.

ST. LUC

Been glancing at some of your

publications on your work with Hobbes.

ROLLO

(eating a knish)

Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you

won't find any real meat in them.

ST. LUC (V.O.)

No? How come?

ROLLO

(shuffling papers)

Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny,

you know? I told you that. But I

didn't really know just how funny he

was. See... when he kicked off, they

sent all the personal secret stuff

they found to his mother -- she's

still alive but just barely -- and

she sent everything she thought was

medical to me here at the lab. I'm

Hobbes's partner, right?

(laughs sardonically)

Anyway, I've been going through his

papers, and what they add up to is

this: Hobbes was shafting us all,

me, the university, the foundations

and the councils, the private labs,

everybody. We never really knew what

it was we were working on. Hobbes

gave us each a few crumbs, but he

was the only one who knew what the

whole loaf would look like.

ST. LUC

OK, I bite. What does it look like?

ROLLO

It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a

disease to save man from his mind.'

ST. LUC (V.O.)

I don't get it.

ROLLO

Lemme clarify for you.

ROLLO

Hobbes thought that man is an animal

that thinks too much, an animal that

has lost touch with his instinct,

his 'primal self'... in other words,

too much brain and not enough guts.

And what he came up with to help our

guts along was a human parasite that

is... lemme find it here... 'a

combination of aphrodisiac and

venereal disease, a modern version

of the satyr's tongue.'

ROLLO

But the important thing for you is

this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a

guinea pig. He implanted her with

the thing. I figure that once the

parasites took, Annabelle went

berserk. I dunno what she did, but

Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had

to kill her. And he wasn't trying to

burn her, he was burning them, all

of them.

ST. LUC

He didn't make it.

ROLLO (V.O.)

Huh?

ST. LUC

Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but

Annabelle was a pretty popular girl

around Starliner Towers. I've got

three men here, maybe four, who're

hosting large, free-moving, apparently

pathogenic, abdominal growths that

nobody I've tried can identify. You

were next on my list.

ROLLO

I'd kinda like to come over there

and have a look at one of these guys.

ST. LUC (V.O.)

I've got a date with one of them at

ten. Can you make it?

ROLLO

Yeah.

(pause)

Ah, I don't want to panic you or

anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes

designed them, they're supposed to

get out of hand real quick, so you

don't have much time to think about

what's happening to you. Once they

decide to start pumping all those

dynamite juices into the old blood

stream... I dunno. But if you see

some people doing kind of compulsive,

maybe even bizarre sexual things...

ST. LUC (V.O.)

(laughing: he doesn't

take this aspect too

seriously)

Yeah? What do I do then?

ROLLO

I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you

can get at them, there's a lotta

stuff you can use. I'll bring a

bagful. It's just the standard

tropical kit. But the trick is to

get at them.

ST. LUC

OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower,

Starliner Towers. May as well go

there directly.

ROLLO (V.O.)

OK, Rog. See you at ten.

FORSYTHE

Roger? If you're going to be staying

here anyway, why don't you come up

to my place for a late supper?

ST. LUC

Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take

a while.

FORSYTHE

(innocently)

Doesn't matter to me how late it is.

I can keep it warm.

FORSYTHE

Anything wrong?

ST. LUC

No. I don't think so.

FORSYTHE

Well? Supper at my place?

ST. LUC

OK. But late.

FORSYTHE

(happy because she

knows she can get

him to stay overnight)

Great! Go back to your files. Bye.

OLD WOMAN

I'm hungry!

OLD WOMAN

I'm hungry!

OLD WOMAN

Hungry for love. Hungry for love.

MR. SPERGAZZI

Lovely, lovely evening. Very quiet,

eh?

MRS. SPERGAZZI

Eh, the children in this apartment,

they're such little thieves. You

have to put a lock on everything.

FORSYTHE

Yes?

FORSYTHE

Can I... can I help you?

KRESIMIR

(speaking with

difficulty)

Yes... you can... help me.

KRESIMIR

Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship

at the shrine of your body, your

body, your body, oh, your body...

ST. LUC

Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong?

What's happened?

FORSYTHE

A man... I think I recognized him...

a man who lives here. He just...

(breaking down)

...he just attacked me for no reason

at all. I just opened the door... I

was making supper for you, and he

grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...

ST. LUC

Where is he now? Do you know?

FORSYTHE

I think I... I think I killed him. I

stabbed him with something and he

fell.

ST. LUC

Will you be OK now? I've got to go

to your place to see if he's still

there. I've got to see if it's... if

it's what we both think it is.

FORSYTHE

Oh, no! You're not leaving me here

all alone. I'm going with you.

ST. LUC

OK, c'mon.

DOORMAN

Here, here. What is this all about?

What's the matter with you? What are

you doing in there?

DOORMAN

Hey, that's enough, enough of this

nonsense! What is this?

(Etc.)

MR. SPERGAZZI

Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help

us!

ST. LUC

What happened?

MR. SPERGAZZI

(tipping his hat as

he introduces himself

even in the midst of

chaos)

Please pardon me. I am Niccolo

Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I

don't know... we were walking in the

hallway and... Cabiria... my wife...

she was attacked by this thing...

here, on her arm.

MR. SPERGAZZI

It's all right, cara mia. What's one

more scar to an old lady, eh? You'll

be OK.

ST. LUC

Where is this thing that attacked

your wife?

MR. SPERGAZZI

I hit it. I hit it with my cane.

Then I carry it on the cane and I

throw it down to the incinerator,

down to the garbage.

ST. LUC

(to Spergazzi)

This is Nurse Forsythe. She's a nurse,

you understand me?

ST. LUC

Go back to their apartment with them

and treat her for second-degree burns.

It'll have to do for now.

(to Spergazzi)

What's your number? The number of

your apartment?

MR. SPERGAZZI

We live in 703.

ST. LUC

(to Forsythe)

OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't

leave until I get there. Lock the

door and don't open it except for

me. OK?

FORSYTHE

But where are you going?

ST. LUC

(walking away)

Down to the incinerator.

TUDOR

Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into

the bedroom, Janine.

JANINE

Nick? Are you up? I can't see a thing,

I took my contacts out.

TUDOR

Hello, darling. I feel wonderful.

Come and sit beside me, beside me on

the bed.

TUDOR

Do you want to make love? You're

absolutely beautiful, those eyes,

that expression. You're absolutely

the most sexy thing alive. Do you

want to make love?

JANINE

(slightly repulsed)

Nick, you're so strange...

TUDOR

You will make love to me, won't you,

Janine? Won't you make love to me?

You start it. Won't you? I think

I've forgotten how to start.

JANINE

(now in tears)

Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.

TUDOR

Please, Janine. Please,

pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine

JanineJanineJanine...

TUDOR

Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so

beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're

my wife.

TUDOR

(pleading)

You're my wife, Janine. Please make

love to me.

JANINE

(frantically)

No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's

stop. I... I want to put my contacts

in... I can't see anything...

TUDOR

(in a mechanical whine)

Make love to me, make love to me,

love, love to me...

JANINE

(trying to buy time)

I want to be able to see us, Nick.

I... I'm going to go into the bathroom

now and put in my contacts, OK? Is

that OK?

(pleading with him to

believe her)

I want to be able to see us when we

make love, OK?

TUDOR

(heart-rending wail)

Ooooooooooooooooo!

TUDOR

(wailing)

Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!

JANINE

(a strangled half-

whisper)

I'm here, Nick. Janine is here.

JANINE

Betts? Betts? It's me.

FORSYTHE

(into receiver)

Hello? Hello?

MR. SPERGAZZI

Miss! Nurse! Come back! Cabiria, she

needs something...!

JANINE

(sobbing)

Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so

hideous. Everything dies and rots

and disappears. I'm going to die,

and you're going to die, and Nick...

BETTS

There, there, there. It all gets

sorted out in the genes and

chromosomes. It's not for us to think

about at all. It's not our problem

at all, 'Nine. We're just here to

exist and to have a good time. Exist

and have a good time.

(pause)

Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel

good to you?

JANINE

Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You

have such a cosy body. I'm jealous,

I'm so skinny.

BETTS

(casually, as though

it were the most

ordinary request in

the world)

Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you

to make love to me. Please, please

make love to me.

JANINE

Betts! You can't really be saying

that! You just can't!

BETTS

Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall

we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's

kiss... kiss and make up, shall we?

'Nine?

FORSYTHE

Roger? Roger, are you here?

MERRICK

...haven't seen anything that looks

like trouble at all. Just filling in

for Walter... the doorman. But if

you want me to call the police, I

will.

MAN

Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.

MR. SPERGAZZI

Yes? Who is there?

ST. LUC

It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let

me speak to the nurse, please.

MR. SPERGAZZI (V.O.)

Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I

think she must go to look for you.

MERRICK

Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I

wonder if I could talk to you for a

second in my office?

MISS LEWIS

Why don't you do something about all

that noise? We like parties, but

this is ridiculous.

MERRICK

Well, there may be a connection.

See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid

somebody busted into it tonight.

MISS LEWIS AND MR WOLF

(together)

Oh, no! What a drag!

MERRICK

'Fraid so. I've got a few of the

things they threw around in my office

and if you could identify it...

ST. LUC

(more to himself than

Forsythe)

Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be

here soon.

ROLLO

Hello, good evening, is anybody here?

Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to

see you for consultation.

ROLLO

It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?

ROLLO

Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr.

Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here.

He must be a little bit late.

ROLLO

Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is

that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a

look at you?

ROLLO

Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't

hurt.

TUDOR

No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't.

You mustn't kill them, no, no, no.

TUDOR

No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's

my blood you're spilling! My blood!

Let them come home, let them come

home, home, home inside me. Don't

kill them...!

TUDOR

(whining pitifully)

At least save me one! For God's sake!

At least save me one. One, one, one,

one...

ST. LUC

Can you walk? I couldn't find anything

wrong with you.

ST. LUC

Rollo and the police should be here

by now. It's just a question of

avoiding infected residents until we

find them.

ST.LUC

OK? Ready to go?

FORSYTHE

Sometimes I have a recurrent dream.

Have I ever told you about it,

darling? I guess you could call it a

Freudian dream, because in this dream

I find myself making love to Sigmund

Freud. But I'm having trouble because

he's old and dying, and he smells

bad and I find him repulsive. And

then he tells me that everything is

erotic, everything is sexual, you

know what I mean? He has a very thick

accent, but I can understand him

perfectly. He tells me that even old

flesh is erotic flesh, that disease

is the love of two alien kinds of

creatures for each other, that dying

is an act of eroticism, that even

chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy

and longing. That breathing is sexual,

that talking is sexual, that just to

physically exist is sexual... And I

believe him, and we make love

beautifully...

WOMAN

(crooning in reply to

Forsythe's howl)

Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone

here who's all alooooooooone?

ST. LUC

(shouting)

Forsythe! Forsythe!

ST. LUC

Have you seen the police? I'm Dr.

St. Luc. Have you seen the police?

Have they come?

BETTS

(to Janine)

A kiss!

(laughter echoes in

the pool room)

Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.

VARIOUS RESIDENTS

(voices echoing in

unison)

A kiss, a kiss, a kiss!

KRESIMIR

(shouting)

Nobody should be alone! Nobody should

be alone tonight!

RESIDENTS

(together)

Nobody alone! Nobody alone!

THE END
