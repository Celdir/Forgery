ARNIE (sings)

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

ARNIE (sings)

It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real

frosty treat, won't you try, won't you

buy Rheingold beer...

ARNIE

Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!

ARNIE

Hot damn! Now... a little oil...

ARNIE

It's not bitter, not sweet... it's

a big fuckin' treat...

ARNIE (sings)

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...

ARNIE

Oh n-

WEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

WEREWOLF (snarling voice)

Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

JANE (voice-over)

This place is Tarker's Mills, where I

grew up... and this is how it was when I

was fourteen - a place where people cared

about each other as much as they cared

about themselves. This is how my town

looked as, all unknowing, it approached the

rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.

JANE (v-o)

The killing had begun, but at first no

one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic

drunk, and what happened seemed like an

accident.

JANE (v-o)

The county coroner concluded that Arnie

passed out on the tracks. There wasn't

enough evidence to conclude anything else.

DISSOLVE TO:

JOE HALLER (amplified voice)

I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,

of Holy Family Catholic Church!

JANE

I'm going out for a while, 'kay?

NAN

All right. Stay close. And make sure your

brother's all right.

LOWE

For the last ten years...

GIRL (mocking)

"Make sure your brother's all right."

JANE (low)

Marty's a booger.

BOB (good-natured)

Just pretend you're in your own church

askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!

LOWE

For the last ten years, I have had a

dream. A dream of a time when modern

medical care would come to this small

community, which sometimes seems so far

from Durham, with her lifesaving

hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at

which I see so many of my friends

gathered, will be the start of making my

dream come true.

MARTY (voice)

Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're

not poisonous?

BRADY (voice)

Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!

MARTY

Lemme hold him!

JANE (v-o)

I was almost fifteen that summer. My

brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his

friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I

had to bear. Brady was actually the worse

of the two, but I was rarely disposed to

see that. Not when my younger brother was

so constantly thrown in my face by my

parents.

LOWE (v-o from the tent)

$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you

think of the lives this unit might save, it

seems very inexpensive indeed.

BRADY

I got an idea.

MARTY

What?

MARTY

You wouldn't.

MARTY

You would.

LOWE

An endeavor like this seems to me to be

the very definition of community - all

of us pulling together as one, farmers

and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...

BRADY (teasing voice)

Jane... Jane...

MARTY

It was just a blacksnake, Jane-

JANE

Look at my knees! Look at my dress!

I hate you!

BRADY

Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her

teddies?

MARTY

Stop it, Brady.

BRADY

Ooooh, naughty!

MARTY

Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We

didn't mean-

JANE

Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,

you booger!

BRADY (with satisfaction)

Really got her goat that time.

MARTY

Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.

STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)

Wait! Don't go!

MAN (voice; rough)

Just leave me alone!

STELLA (calls)

Please! You have to help me!

DECEIVER (keeps walking)

It's your oven, but it ain't my bun

you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.

JANE

Stella? Is that you?

STELLA (alarmed)

Who - ?

JANE (approaching closer)

It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.

JANE (tenderly)

What's wrong?

STELLA (weeping)

He's going away. I know he is.

JANE

Who's going away?

STELLA

What am I going to tell my mother? If

he won't marry me, what am I going to

tell my mother?

JANE (bewildered)

Stella, I don't know what-

STELLA

Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me

alone, you stupid thing!

O'BANION

Let us pray.

O'BANION

May the Grace of God shine upon those

gathered here... and lift them up... and

grant success to the endeavor to which

they have so openheartedly declared their

support. Amen.

NAN

I want you two to bury the hatchet.

You're being very silly, Jane.

JANE (hot)

Did you see my knees?

MARTY

Jane, I-

NAN

I think you're being mean as well as

silly. Your brother has never had a

scraped knee in his whole life.

JANE

You always take his side because he's a

cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's

a cripple!

MARTY

Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I

couldn't stop him.

JANE

Brady's a booger and so are you!

NAN

Jane Coslaw!

BOB (roars)

Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of

you out!

BOB (points)

That's where poor old Arnie Westrum

pitched his last drunk.

BOB

They had to pick up what was left of

him in a peach basket.

JANE

Oh, Daddy! Gross!

MARTY

Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?

That's what Brady said.

JANE

If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit.

I mean it.

NAN (no sympathy)

You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I

think we've all had quite enough of this

horror-movie talk.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTY (v-o)

Janey?... Are you awake?

MARTY

Can I come in?

JANE

What's the money for?

MARTY

A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

JANE

I don't want your money. You're a booger.

MARTY

It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God.

Please take the money. I want to make up.

JANE

I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the

pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.

MARTY

That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it

to me-

JANE (scorn)

That drunk!

MARTY

-but I want you to have it.

MARTY

Yeah, go ahead.

JANE

You booger!

MARTY (grinning)

It really is for your birthday, though -

try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.

JANE

Go to hell!

MARTY (smiling)

I love you, Janey.

STELLA

Suicides go to hell. Especially if

they're pregnant. And I don't even care.

MOTHER

Oh my dear God... Stella!

MOTHER

Stella!...Stella!

JOE HALLER (voice)

Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!

PETE

What'd they say, Joe?

HALLER

They said they'd be here by noon.

PETE (nervous)

Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling

that Smokey Bear from the Detective

Division to fuck off, Joe.

HALLER (morosely)

I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a

mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's

go on out there.

BRADY

Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and

the Silver Bullet!

BRADY

You glad to be back in jail, Marty?

MARTY

Sure - I like school.

TAMMY

You booger.

MARTY

That's what my sister says, too. Pretty

soon I'm going to start checking the

mirror to see if I'm turning green.

BRADY

I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.

MARTY

Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the

regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.

TAMMY

What's that?

MARTY

Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime

this summer and we'd soup up the engine...

but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and

he's in the doghouse with my mother.

TAMMY

For getting a divorce?

MARTY

Well... it is his third.

TAMMY

Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was

scared to go past her house by myself.

MARTY (matter-of-fact)

Yeah... it is a little scary.

TAMMY

I mean, I saw her. All the time.

TAMMY

I used to see her every day, and she never

knew what was going to happen to her, and

neither did I! I mean I know how stupid

that sounds, but...

MARTY

Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.

TAMMY

There's something else scary.

MARTY

What?

TAMMY (points)

That.

TAMMY

I've been hearing noises in there.

MARTY

What kind of noises?

TAMMY

Rattling. Rustling.

MARTY

Rats...

TAMMY

And my dad says it's kids. But it's not

rats and it's not kids. It's-

MILT

Tammy, you get on in here and do some

dishes!

TAMMY (voice)

I've got to go.

MARTY

I'd go out and take a look myself, but I

think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden.

It looks sorta greasy.

TAMMY

You would, wouldn't you?

MARTY (Joe Cool)

Sure. No sweat.

TAMMY

Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked

since... you know.

MARTY

Yeah... but if you hear any more noises,

tell your father. Okay?

TAMMY

Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,

Marty?

MARTY (Startled)

Jeez!

MARTY

I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.

MILT (voice)

TAMMY!

TAMMY (calls)

Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks

again for coming home with me.

MILT

'Bout time. Why you want to hang around

that cripple?

TAMMY

I like him.

MILT

Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.

Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance

the fucking budget.

DISSOLVES TO:

MARTY (prayerfully)

Come on, baby-

VIRGIL

Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!

MARTY

Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?

VIRGIL

Want me to check the oil?

MARTY

Sure!

VIRGIL

Wipe the windshield an check the driver's

bullshit level?

UNCLE AL (voice)

I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you

a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a

Rod Carew.

MARTY

Okay, okay. I call.

UNCLE AL

Wait a minute, wait a minute!

UNCLE AL

Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager!

Stone the crows!

MARTY

Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

UNCLE AL

Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.

NAN

Come on, Marty- bedtime.

MARTY

Mom-!

UNCLE AL

Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

NAN

Make it quick.

UNCLE AL

Three kings.

MARTY (delighted)

I got a straight to the queen!

UNCLE AL

Bullshit luck!

NAN (outraged)

That's enough!

MARTY (as his mother wheels him away)

Aww, Mom-!

NAN

I don't want you drinking around Marty.

That's too much. If you can't stop it,

you better stay away.

UNCLE AL

I come here because Marty needs a friend.

NAN

Yes... you've always been that to him.

But if you can't leave your booze in

whatever dump you call home, you better

just stay away.

UNCLE AL (to himself)

Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's

house! Heeyyy!

MARTY

Mom was really mad at him this time,

wasn't she?

JANE

What do you expect, when he comes in

smelling like a brewery and looking like

an unmade bed?

MARTY

Stop it!

BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice)

Hey! That you, Marty?

JANE

He's okay, Dad!

JANE (low)

Marty, are you all right?

MARTY

Yes. Go away.

JANE

Let me help you up.

NAN (voice)

Marty?

NAN

Jane, have you been teasing your

brother again?

MARTY

She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush

and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane

helped pick me up.

MARTY (syrupy voice)

Jane's wunnnderful.

JANE (hands it to him)

Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that

shit in your head might leak down into your

mouth and poison you.

NAN

Jane Coslaw!

MILT (drunk)

Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!

MILT (all eyes again)

Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!

MILT

Let's see if you want to come back and

break my pots all to shit after I put

some rock salt in your asses!

MILT (shouts)

Who's there?

MRS. STURMFULLER

Tammy, where's your father?

ELMER (to VIRGIL)

Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man

up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!

VIRGIL

But the woman's bed was ripped right down

the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to

do something like that!

PORTER

Damn straight!

ELMER

Shut up, Porter. (To VIRGIL) What about the

tracks?

VIRGIL

That could be something to throw off the

cops. And it ain't animals that try to

confues the law; it's people do that.

ANDY FAIRTON

Law around here don't need much confusing.

ANDY (deep disgust)

Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if

someone rammed it full of radium and gave

him a Geiger counter.

PETE SYLVESTER (comes over)

Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd

over getting fined two hundred bucks for

that little fender bender out on the Ridge

Road last year.

ANDY

Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to

take care of his mouth before someone comes

along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe

Haller's salary to keep the people in this

town safe, and he ain't doing it.

BILLY (mildly)

Last town report said you was in arrears

your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid

up, huh?

ANDY

What are you, trying to be smart?

OWEN

You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm

gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?

ANDY (sulks)

Bring me a Schlitz.

MARTY (calls)

Here it comes!

BRADY

Drop it!

JANE

Marty Coslaw, you get down out of

that tree!

MARTY

Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?

JANE (makes no immediate move to do so)

Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.

MARTY (hanging)

Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?

JANE

They both are. At me, for not getting you

sooner. I ought to let you fall.

MARTY (voice)

Hey, Brady! You coming?

BRADY (looking into the sky)

In a while!

JANE

Come on, Marty.

ANDY (holding forth)

This whole investigation has been as

efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-

PETE (bravely)

I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If

you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to

shut it for you.

ANDY (astounded)

What did you say?

OWEN

Jesus wept.

PETE

You heard what I said, motormouth.

HERB (quite loudly)

Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?

HERB

Brady!

HERB

Get out of my way!

JOE HALLER (low voice)

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with

thee. Blessed art thou among women...

HALLER (low)

...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.

Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for

us sinners now...now...

HALLER

Stay off the bandstand, Herb.

HERB

Is it my boy? Is it Brady?

HALLER

Don't go up-

HERB (lunges past him)

Brady! Brady!

HERB

Br-(CUTS OFF)

PETE

Joe, is it-

HALLER (not looking up)

Shhh.

PETE

Is it the Kicaid b-

HALLER (not looking up)

Shhh, I said.

ANDY

What the fuck is going on h-

HERB (voice; laughing)

We'll bury his shoes.

HERB (voice; laughing)

That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury

his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan

cigar boxes.

HERB

We'll bury his shoes because his feet are

still in them and they're the only part of

him that makes sense anymore.

HERB

It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this

town ever saw!

DISSOLVE TO:

JANE (v-o)

My mother and father- my mother in

particular- did not much care for Uncle

Al...

JANE (v-o continues)

...but when it came to such unpleasant

duties as taking Marty to the funeral

of his best friend...

JANE (v-o continues)

...they didn't at all mind drafting him.

As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may

have been able to offer him...

JANE (v-o continues)

...I now believe that was best kept between

the two of them...

JANE (v-o concludes)

...or among the three of them.

LOWE

Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there

be no mass said here this afternoon. There

will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid

this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word

of comfort to you, if I could.

LOWE

If there is any word of comfort I can give

you, it's just this: the face of the beast

always becomes known; the time of the beast

always passes.

LOWE

If there are times when we feel alone and

afraid, only small creatures in the dark,

then these are the times when we must turn

to one another for our comfort and our hope.

To our neighbors. To our community. To our

love for each other. I alone cannot ease

the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can

I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if

I believe anything it's this: we can comfort

each other. We can heal each other. We can

go on together.

LOWE

The Bible tells us not to fear the terror

that creepeth by night or that which flieth

by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because

there is much we don't know, and we feel

very small. But we must not be alone. We must

not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is

the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to

each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try

to remember that the face of the beast always

becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast

always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.

UNCLE AL

You all right, Marty?

MARTY

Yeah.

UNCLE AL

There's a saying- so-and-so was better than

a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You

ever hear that one?

MARTY

No.

UNCLE AL

Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They

better get the guy.

MARTY

Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?

UNCLE AL

Huh?

MARTY

What if it's some kind of monster?

UNCLE AL (laughs)

Jesus, Marty! Come off it!

MARTY

What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?

UNCLE AL

A bunch of men getting ready to pretend

they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't

anybody ever tell you that the only monsters

are in comic books and drive-in movies?

MARTY

Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in

that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a

big animal. Her father was killed that night.

UNCLE AL

Marty, you have to get this idea out of

your head. Psychotics are more active

when the moon is full, and this guy is a

psycho. He's going to turn out to be as

human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of

speaking. Now let's get you inside.

ANDY FAIRTON

Okay, you all know what group you're in and

what area you'll be covering, right?

PORTER ZINNEMAN

Damn straight!

ELMER ZINNEMAN

Shut up, Porter.

ANDY

Groups one through four are in the woods

north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and

six west of Carson Creek.

ANDY (continuing)

Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.

ANDY (continuing)

If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight

tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.

PORTER (happily)

Damn straight!

ELMER

Shut up, Porter.

ANDY

Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not

each other. So look before you-

HALLER

I want all of you folks to go home!

HALLER

I can't remember deputizing a single one

of you!

ANDY

That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is

that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one

of you has done a damn thing about solving

this case.

HALLER (without much force)

We'll catch him.

ANDY

You couldn't catch a cold.

HALLER

The law has a name for what you men are

planning. It's private justice, and private

justice is about a step and a half away

from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no

J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's

Mills, and I want you men to go home.

ANDY

Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done

since this thing started but hang his face out?

ANDY (louder)

He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!

OWEN KNOPFLER

Ah, shut up, Andy.

ANDY

Don't tell me to-

HERB

Yes. Correct. Shut up.

HERB (quietly)

I just came from my boy's funeral.

HALLER

Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken

you must be...but-

HERB (quietly)

He was torn apart.

HALLER

Yes. Yes, but-

HERB (still quiet)

Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.

Constable, you don't know what those words

mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!

HERB

My son was torn to pieces!

(turning back to HALLER)

You come in here and talk to these men

about private justice. You dare to do that.

Constable Haller, why don't you go out to

Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady

and explain to him about private justice.

Would you want to do that?

HERB

No. I thought not.

(to the others)

You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't

ask anyone to do anything that runs counter

to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out

and hunt up a little private justice.

LOWE

Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...

BILLY (not looking at LOWE)

Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.

HALLER

Let them go.

LOWE

But-

HALLER

This is that spirit of community you were

talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll

shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can

mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit

the Medcu van, of course.

LOWE

But can't we do anything?

HALLER

Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them

get killed.

ANDY

Well, it's about frigging time! They'll

have his hide tacked to somebody's barn

door before we get out there!

ELMER

Help me Porter, goddammit!

ELMER

Don't pull me! You want to rip the right

cheek of my ass right off?

PORTER

Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say

you've been half-assed most of your-

ELMER

Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?

VIRGIL

Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.

O'BANION

Come on. Be careful.

VIRGIL

Rev'runt! What is it?

O'BANION (screaming)

My foot! My foot!

O'BANION (SCREAMING)

Get it off me! Get it off me!

VIRGIL (flustered)

Sure...okay...

ANDY (pointing across)

It came from over there.

BOBBY ROBERTSON

As far as I could tell, it could have come

from anywhere.

ANDY

We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the

bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.

BOBBY

I dunno-

MAGGIE

I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade

in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in

it, Bobby?

OWEN (quietly)

Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.

BOBBY (stoutly)

I ain't scared! Let's go!

ANDY

Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.

BILLY McCLAREN

Where's it coming from? Other side?

BOBBY

No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't

trust-

ASPINALL

It isn't on either side.

ANDY

What are you-

ASPINALL

It's under the fog. It's right in with us.

BOBBY (moaning)

I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!

ASPINALL (low)

I think we better start backing up, Andy.

Real slow. Real-

WEREWOLF (voice)

"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"

WEREWOLF (voice)

"Real slow! Real slow!"

WEREWOLF (voice; laughing)

"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"

Come on, then! You want to rock and roll

with me?

WEREWOLF

"REEEEEL SLOW!"

MAGGIE (shrieking)

Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!

ANDY (groaning with fear)

I don't want to look at it.

OWEN

Come on, come on! You want to do the bop?

I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!

OWEN (voice)

Come on, you bastard!

LOWE

Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there

There is no comfort, Father. Only private

LOWE

Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

REV. LOWE

No! No! No!

CONGREGATION (snarling it out)

It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real

frosty treat...

MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL

Won't you try, won't you buy...

CONGREGATION (big finish)

...Rheiinngold beer!

LOWE (praying)

Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please

HALLER (indifferently)

Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.

PETE

Yeah... but what are they doing?

HALLER

Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker

cap, I deduce that they are leaving.

HALLER

She's not the only one. Lot of people

leaving town. And I guess if we want a

beer, we'll have to drink it at home.

PETE

Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't

never seen you like this.

HALLER (thoughtful)

I lost my guts.

PETE (startled)

Bullshit.

HALLER

It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him...

and I felt it happen. It was no big deal.

No worse than pissing down your own leg.

You ever do that? Maybe when you were

real scared?

HALLER

One minute I had me some guts- as much as

the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.

PETE

Joe... you are going to feel better than

this. This... this feeling of yours...

it's gonna pass...

JOE

Is it?

MARTY (voice)

It's not fair.

JANE (voice)

Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't

get something he wanted!

NAN COSLAW

Stop it, Jane.

JANE

Well, I don't see why everybody just about

breaks down and cries whenever he-

BOB

Stop it, your mother said.

MARTY

It isn't enough that the monster killed all

those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's

got them to cancel the fair.

UNCLE AL

And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.

MARTY

Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's

all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing

that is just a... a...

UNCLE AL

It's just an outward symbol of everything

that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not

bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in

college. I can jive that shit all day.

MARTY

Well... I like it that you always know how

to say things, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

I'll give you the telephone numbers of my

ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested

to hear that.

MARTY

Don't call me dear boy.

UNCLE AL

But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

UNCLE AL

Look at this.

UNCLE AL (gleeful)

This is gonna turn your wheelchair into

a fucking F-14, Marty-

UNCLE AL

Your mom's not around, is she?

MARTY

She and dad are out back lighting the

barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's

King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

UNCLE AL

Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be

Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that

adjustable.

UNCLE AL

The guy killed your best friend, drove your

girl out of town, and stole the second-best

holiday in the year. Have I got it right?

MARTY (glum)

You got it right, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that...

but I got something that just might cheer

you up.

MARTY

What?

UNCLE AL

Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.

UNCLE AL

All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.

UNCLE AL (grinning)

Gun it.

UNCLE AL

Jesus! Not too much!

MARTY (awed)

Wow.

UNCLE AL

You got a pilot's license, Marty?

MARTY

Do I need one?

UNCLE AL

We're gonna find out. Take it down the

road a ways and back. Be careful.

UNCLE AL (to himself)

The kid's dead meat. What have I done?

(shouts)

Put a rock in it, Marty!

UNCLE AL

You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm

dying. I hope you're happy, because you

are looking at a dying man.

MARTY

It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

It goes fast, all right- and if your mother

finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have

a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna

Boys' Choir.

MARTY

I don't get you.

UNCLE AL

I know you don't. But I want this to be our

secret. You get that, don't you?

MARTY

Sure.

UNCLE AL

Good.

UNCLE AL

I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.

NAN

So have I, actually... I wish it could always

be like this.

UNCLE AL

See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure

I stay out of trouble at least that long.

MARTY

Okay.

UNCLE AL

Now I said I had something for you, as

I believe you will recall.

MARTY

Yeah! What is it?

UNCLE AL

You're gonna have the Fourth of July in

October, Marty. Just don't blow your head

off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't

just the fireworks. It's because no crazy

shithead should be able to stop the good

guys, if you can dig that.

MARTY (respectfully)

I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!

UNCLE AL

Stay near the house, for Christ's sake-

someone's killing people. I have to be out of

my mind to be doing this, you know.

MARTY

Yeah, I know. It's great!

UNCLE AL

One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that

you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't

set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?

Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?

MARTY

Yeah... sure.

UNCLE AL

Save this one for last.

MARTY

What is it?

UNCLE AL

A tracer. You'll like it.

MARTY

Thanks a million, Uncle Al!

UNCLE AL

You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em

in the bushes for now.

UNCLE AL (grinning)

Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out

for the werewolves!

MARTY (whispers)

Shit!

MARTY (softly)

All right!

MARTY (soft)

Here's one for the good guys!

MARTY (delighted)

All right!

MARTY

Is someone there?

MARTY (terrified)

Who's there?

MARTY (voice; moaning)

Oh, please...

WEREWOLF (snarling voice)

Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you!

Reeeal slow!

UNCLE AL (muzzy voice)

'Lo? Go away.

MARTY

It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-

UNCLE AL

You dreamed it, Marty.

MARTY (voice)

No! I went out late last night- and-

UNCLE AL

There are no such things as werewolves.

Please, dear boy, have some pity.

GIRL (muzzy voice)

Whowuzzit?

UNCLE AL

Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.

JANE

Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting

here all morning.

MARTY

Where's Mom?

JANE

Went shopping. Why?

MARTY

Jane, I have to talk to you.

JANE (mistrustfully)

About what?

MARTY

I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't

believe me, and if you won't help me, I...

I...

JANE (concerned)

Marty, what is it?

JANE (voice-over)

He told me something that was clearly

unbelievable... and yet, somehow I

believed most of it. And I understood

one thing with total clarity: Marty

himself believed it all.

MRS. THAYER

Jane?

JANE (politely)

I'm collecting returnable bottles and

cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer-

I just wondered if you had any.

MR. THAYER

Who is it?

MRS. THAYER

Jane Coslaw.

JANE

Hi, Mr. Thayer.

MR. THAYER

Hello, Jane.

MRS. THAYER

Bring your cart around to the back, Jane-

we'll look in the garage.

JANE

Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

JANE (voice-over)

Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al

was thirty-five that summer and I was

fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe

the unbelievable, although even then that

ability is growing rusty, is preparing to

squeal to a stop.

JANE (calls)

Hi, Father Lowe!

LOWE (without turning)

Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!

JANE

I'm going to bring in a monster load

of bottles in an hour or so!

LOWE (still digging)

That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.

JANE (v-o)

Marty had seen where the tracer had

struck home, he said, and I went out

that day doing more than just looking

for returnable cans and bottles- I was

looking for a man- or woman- with only

one eye.

BILLY

I know what you're after, Jane, and you're

out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in

yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.

JANE

Oh... okay.

JANE

That you, Mr. Fairton?

ANDY FAIRTON (muffled)

No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for

a shave and a burger.

JANE (sweetly)

Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?

ANDY

No!

JANE (just as sweet)

Oh... okay.

JANE

'Bye, Mr. McClaren.

BILLY (amused)

'Bye, Jane.

ANDY (muffled)

Jesus!

JANE

Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my

bottles and cans!

JANE (voice)

Father?

LOWE

Take your cart around to the garage

and unload, Jane! Then bring me your

tally sheet!

JANE

Okay!

JANE

Father Lowe?

JANE

Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...

LOWE (voice)

Very good, Jane!

LOWE (grins)

Good, Jane. Very... very good.

LOWE (concerned)

Jane! You're trembling!

JANE

I... I don't feel so well, I guess

maybe I got too much sun.

LOWE

Would you like to come in the parlor and

lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink?

I have some soda-

JANE

No! (softer) That is, I have to get home

and help my mom with lunch.

LOWE

I'll give you a ride!

JANE

No- she... she was going to meet me at the

market. I'll be fine.

LOWE

Give my best to your brother, Jane.

JANE

I will.

LOWE (soft)

Real slow.

MARTY (almost moaning)

Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?

JANE

I ran faster than I ever ran in my life-

what do you think, dummox? By the time I

got back here, I really thought I was

going to faint. (Pause) What are we going

to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody-

grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are

we going to do?

MARTY (thoughtfully)

I think I know.

JANE (v-o)

I mailed another letter for Marty the

next day... a third the day after that.

Then, on Saturday...

JANE (v-o)

...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.

(Pause) His reaction was less than serene.

UNCLE AL

Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!

JANE

Uncle Al-

UNCLE AL (to JANE)

From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think

his common sense got paralyzed along with

his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little

Polly Practical!

JANE (quiet)

You don't understand.

UNCLE AL (wildly)

Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that

my niece and nephew are sending the local

Catholic priest little love notes suggesting

that he gargle with a broken light bulb or

eat a rat-poison omelet!

MARTY

It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's

wearing an eye-patch!

UNCLE AL

I called Peltzer on my way over here,

Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore

two days ago for a bottle of otic solution.

That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's

got a corneal inflammation.

MARTY

Was it a prescription?

UNCLE AL

What the hell does that matter?

MARTY

It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because

to get a prescription he'd have to see a

doctor.

UNCLE AL

Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!

MARTY

Well... was it a prescription?

UNCLE AL

I don't know. But I know you didn't see

any werewolf the other night, Marty. You

had a dream, that's all. An extremely

realistic nightmare brought on by what's

been happening in this town.

MARTY

What about the baseball bat Jane saw in

his shed? You know who used to have a

baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He

was so proud of it he used to carry it in

the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it

looked like the Green Giant used it for

a toothpick!

UNCLE AL

You want to know what I think?

MARTY

No- we just got you out here so we could

admire your pretty face.

UNCLE AL

Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a

hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or

something.

JANE (indignant)

It was not! You want me to show you! Come

on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!

UNCLE AL

No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for

palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic

Werewolf.

MARTY

Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of

it by now anyway.

JANE

If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb,

why hasn't he picked up the telephone and

called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's

sending poison-pen letters?

UNCLE AL

I don't accept the idea that he knows who his

letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept

the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw

Marty in his wheelchair.

JANE

Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told

Constable Haller that someone is sending

him poison-pen letters?

UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed)

Well... he probably did. I mean, he could

make a complaint without taking an ad out

in the paper, couldn't he?

MARTY

I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff

was nonprescription. And I'll bet you

another quarter he hasn't said anything

to Mr. Haller.

UNCLE AL

Marty, do you see your suspect?

MARTY (grim)

Yes, I see him.

UNCLE AL

Do you really think that a man who took

a rocket in the eye three nights ago

could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either

be in the hospital... or dead.

MARTY

I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot

him when he was-

UNCLE AL

When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.

Jane, you don't really believe this madness,

do you?

JANE

I don't know exactly what I believe. But I

know that what I saw was a baseball bat and

not a broomstick. I know there was something

strange about the way the house smelled that

day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I

believe in Marty. I mean- there are times

when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but

I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to

believe in him, too, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

Kids!

LOWE (quietly)

Little bastard.

OUTFIELDER

You comin' down to Robertson's for a

soda, Marty?

MARTY

No- I guess I'll go home.

OUTFIELDER

Okay- seeya!

MARTY

Yeah... seeya.

LOWE (whispers)

Bastard.

LOWE

Oh, you bastard!

MARTY

Come on, baby... come on...

LOWE (soft voice)

Marty...

LOWE

I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if

you believe that or not, but it's true. I

would never willingly hurt a child. You

should have left me alone, Marty.

LOWE (soft; soothing)

I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our

religion teaches that suicide is the

greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.

Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide;

if she had done so, she would be burning in

hell right now. By killing her I took her

physical life but saved her life eternal.

You see, Marty? You see how all things serve

the will and the mind of God? You see, you

meddling little shit!

LOWE

You're going to have a terrible accident,

Marty. You're going to fall into the river.

MARTY (waving madly)

Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!

MARTY

I ran out of gas.

ELMER

Spooky in there, ennit?

MARTY (with feeling)

It sure is!

DISSOLVE TO:

UNCLE AL

Well... it's a lot easier to swallow

without the hair and the foaming jaws.

Also, I checked on the otic solution.

It was counter brand. No prescription

needed.

MARTY

I told you!

UNCLE AL

Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.

JANE (sits down)

Did you talk to the constable?

UNCLE AL

After Marty called me with his latest

Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause)

He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged

at all.

MARTY

I told you!

JANE

Shut up, Marty.

UNCLE AL (reluctantly)

There's something else.

MARTY					JANE

UNCLE AL

I probably shouldn't tell you- you're

both hysterical on the subject. I'm

starting to feel like a guy handing

out free Arthur Murray coupons to

victims of the dancing sickness.

MARTY

Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-

UNCLE AL (reluctant)

I went out to that rest area.

MARTY (triumph)

You found the tracer?

UNCLE AL

No... but I found some blood, smeared on

a tree trunk in that grove.

MARTY

There! You see!

UNCLE AL

It could have been anything, Marty.

MARTY

What about Father Lowe chasing me in his

car and trying to run me down? You don't

think that was a dream, do you?

UNCLE AL

No.

UNCLE AL

Lowe's car-?

JANE

Blue. This blue.

UNCLE AL

Jesus.

HALLER

That's just about the craziest damn story

I've ever heard, Al.

UNCLE AL

I know. I could have edited out all of the

completely crazy stuff, but I thought you

deserved to hear it with the bark on.

HALLER

I appreciate that. Now, the next question:

Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?

UNCLE AL

Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should

be checked out.

HALLER

That can be arranged.

MARTY

Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and

guess what? No one sees him again!

UNCLE AL

And what do you suggest I do about it,

dear boy?

MARTY

I want you to turn this into a silver

bullet.

UNCLE AL

You're not going to let it go, are you?

MARTY

I saw what I saw.

UNCLE AL

Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

JANE (quietly)

In the made-up stories, the guy who's the

werewolf only changes when the moon is full.

But maybe he's really that way almost all

the time, only as the moon gets fuller...

MARTY (finishes)

...the guy gets wolfier.

JANE (hands AL her crucifix)

Here. Take mine, too.

MARTY

Jane... you don't have to do that.

JANE

Don't tell me what I have to do and what I

don't, booger-brains.

MARTY

Will you marry me, Jane?

UNCLE AL

Would you kids mind telling me how this guy

Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?

JANE

I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

MARTY

No one knows how cancer begins, either- or

exactly what it is- but people still

believe in it.

UNCLE AL

The kid is eleven years old and already

he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

MARTY

I think he's going to come for me. Not

just because I know who he is, but

because I hurt him. Only I don't think

he'll try again as Lowe.

UNCLE AL

Dear boy, you have gone right out of

your mind.

MARTY

Will you do it?

MARTY

Please, Uncle Al.

JANE

Will you?

UNCLE AL

All right. I give up. Yes.

MARTY							JANE

UNCLE AL

If either of you ever tells anyone I even

bought a piece of this story, werewolves

will be the least of your problems.

JANE (voice-over)

Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a

gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an

old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard

of weapons.

JANE (v-o continues)

God knows what sort of story my uncle

told him, but I think that for men who

have been married as often as Uncle Al,

invention on short notice becomes

something of a specialty.

JANE (v-o continues)

The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade

silver content of my crucifix and Marty's

medallion...

JANE (v-o continues)

...melted them down...

JANE (v-o concludes)

...and molded them into a silver bullet.

MAC

Here it is.

MAC

Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think.

It's got a low-grain load so it won't

tumble. Should be pretty accurate.

UNCLE AL

It's just a gag, that's all. What would

you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?

MAC (joking)

How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy

Halloween, Al.

JANE (voice-over)

By the time Marty's silver bullet was done,

it was Halloween... and the full moon had

come around again. Earlier that afternoon,

my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer

for over seven years, finally finished the job.

NAN

Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton

in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral

parlor. It's Stickney and-

UNCLE AL

-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!

NAN

And don't open the door for any trick or

treaters even if they come!

UNCLE AL

We won't!

NAN

You kids go to bed on time! You've got

school tomorrow!

UNCLE AL

If you keep doing that, you're going to

bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama-

tell her I'll see her Thursday.

NAN

I will- be good, kids.

MARTY							JANE

UNCLE AL

Can I tell you kids something?

JANE

Sure, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

When me and sissy were kids, we were

just like you two.

MARTY

Yeah? Really?

UNCLE AL

Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still

are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

BOB

I can't believe that you'd agree to leave

the kids with him. A year ago I would have

laughed at the idea. You used to almost

breathe fire when Al came in the house.

NAN

He's changed. Just this summer. Or

something's changed him. Marty, maybe.

And the drinking- I think it's almost

stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful.

And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure

of it.

BOB

I know they'll be safe with him... but will

he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?

NAN (firmly)

If I told him to, he will.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

This concludes WDML's broadcast day.

JANE (sleepy)

You'll burn yourself up sometime doing

that, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL

I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

MARTY

But Uncle Al! You said-

UNCLE AL

I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten

past one. He's not coming.

JANE

The moon's not down yet...

UNCLE AL

Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this

stupid gun in my lap because I promised,

but you two are going to bed. Go on,

now, scoot.

MARTY

What if I say no?

UNCLE AL

Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.

(more kindly) Go on, now.

MARTY

If that'd gone off, it would have been the

end of our silver bullet.

UNCLE AL

See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.

JANE (shrieking)

It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!

IT'S THE WEREWOLF!

UNCLE AL (sharply)

You see it, Marty!

MARTY (shakes his head)

I was looking at you...

UNCLE AL

A very familiar feeling is beginning to

creep over me.

MARTY

What's that, Uncle Al?

UNCLE AL

I feel like a horse's ass.

JANE (weeping)

I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!

JANE

Don't you touch me, snotbrains!

MARTY

Jane-

UNCLE AL

Would you kids go to bed? My head's

starting to ache.

WEREWOLF (voice)

Reeeal slow...

MARTY

It's here! It's outside!

UNCLE AL

Jane, it's just a power fai-

MARTY

Get the gun!

MARTY (scream)

Janey! The gun! THE GUN!

WEREWOLF (snarls)

Maa-aaa-rty...

WEREWOLF (foaming)

Maaa-aaa-rty...

JANE (sobbing)

Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!

WEREWOLF

Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-

WEREWOLF

Bastard Marty!

WEREWOLF

Kill you...

WEREWOLF

Bastard Marty!

UNCLE AL (voice)

You okay, Janey?

JANE

I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-

MARTY (calls)

I'm all right. He's dead.

UNCLE AL (to MARTY)

There. I told you there weren't any such

things as werewolves.

JANE (nervous)

Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or

whatever it is?

UNCLE AL

If it isn't now, it will be after I pound

one of your mother's silver candlesticks

through its heart.

JANE (grimaces)

Oh Uncle Al, no!

UNCLE AL (grim)

Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I

believe it all the way.

JANE

Are you all right, Marty?

MARTY

All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

JANE

You're a real booger, you know it?

MARTY (smiles)

I love you, Jane.

JANE (voice-over)

It wasn't always easy for me to answer

that... but I could answer it that night,

and I find I can say it now that the

terrible events of that fall have receded

to memories which seem little more than

dreams in my mind.

JANE (hugging him)

I love you, Marty.

JANE (voice-over; no more than a whisper)

I love you, Marty... good night.

FADE OUT.
