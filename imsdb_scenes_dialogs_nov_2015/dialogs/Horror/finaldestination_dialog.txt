Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave

So, it should stay on, or with,

That's seven hours and most of it is

Man, that is one George Michael

Dude, get wisdom. We're about to

board a seven hour flight. The

toilets in coach are barely

ventilated closets. What if your

body wants that airplane food out of

your system and you have to go torgue

a wicked cable and then right after

you walks in Christa or Blake? You

MS. LEWTON

Airline's not taking this very well.

They'll let one of us back on and

the rest can grab a six-ten flight.

Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.

It's alright. It's not that big of a

deal.

MR. MURNAU

I'll stay.

No, you know the whole French thing.

Get on the plane.

BILLY

I was in the bathroom. The lock was

stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!

TOD

I called your mom and dad and

they're on their way.

MS. LEWTON

Alex, talk to me. What happened?

ALEX

I... I saw it... like, I don't

know... the plane took off. I saw

it leave the runway... I looked down

and saw the ground...

ALEX (CONT'D)

And then the cabin banged and the

left side exploded. The the whole

plane... blew up. It was so real.

Exactly how everything goes.

TOD

Been on many planes that blew up,

have you?

MS. LEWTON

You must have fallen asleep.

CARTER

We get thrown off the plane and blow

a half day in Paris because Browning

has a bad dream?

It's going to explode! It's going to

explode!

TOD

Fuck off, Horton.

MS. LEWTON

Tod...

ALEX

Only trip you're gonna take is to

He's not a witch.

SEIGEL

Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National

Transportation Safety Board vice

chairmen. We've notified your families

and they are on their way. Does anyone

feel they need medical attention or

spiritual counseling at this time?

MS. LEWTON

Have they found any survivors?

What's going on?

SEIGEL

The cause of the explosion is

undetermined. Nassau county

authorities are on the scene. Naval

search and rescue are en route.

WEINE

We understand how you must be

feeling at this hour... and although

we know it may be difficult, we must

ask you some questions... regarding

today's events, while it's still

fresh in your minds.

WEINE

It may be valuable to our rescue

attempts, or any potential...

criminal investigation.

CUT TO:

SCHRECK

You said...

(checks notes)

"Listen to me! This plane will

explode on take-off."

(to Alex)

How did you know that?

ALEX

I got this... feeling... a weird

feeling... I can't explain it...

WEINE

Did you take any seditives before

boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping

pills?

ALEX

No. I saw it. I saw it!

ALEX

Not like a dream... more than that.

I experienced the plane exploding...

it was so horrible... I know what

they all went through tonight...

ALEX (CONT'D)

I'm not a pyschic... I've never had

this happen before...

SCHRECK

Did this "weird feeling" have

anything to do with you saying

you wished Carter Horton was on the

plane... just before it exploded?

ALEX

No!

SCHRECK

Why'd you say it?

ALEX

Because... I... never thought it

would really happen.

WEINE

If that's the case, Alex... why did

you really get off the plane?

CUT TO:

TOD

My brother... told me to keep an eye

on Alex. He stayed... and I went to

make sure Alex was okay.

(a whisper)

He told me to get off the plane.

MS. LEWTON

Larry Murnau told me to get back

on... but I told him to go.

(pause, guiltily)

I sent him back on the plane.

WEINE

No one forced you to get off the

plane. You told us you aren't friends

with any that did... so, why did you

leave the airplane?

CLEAR

Because I saw and I heard Alex.

And... I believed him.

MINISTER (V.O.)

Thirty-nine days have passed since

we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones,

friends, and teachers.

MINISTER (CONT'D)

As each day passes without a

determining cause for the accident,

we ask ourselves, "Why?"

MINISTER (CONT'D)

Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more

knows his time than fish taken in

the fatal net...

MINISTER (CONT'D)

...or birds trapped in the snare...

MINISTER (CONT'D)

...like these the children of men...

MINISTER (CONT'D)

suddenly upon them."

MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.)

And so before we can heal, before we

can escape the presence of Death

Time, we must mourn and celebrate

theirs with this memorial.

CARTER

Hope you don't think, Browning, that

because my name ain't on this wall...

that I owe you anything.

ALEX

I don't.

CARTER

(re: victims)

All I owe is these people.

(turns to Alex)

To live my life to the fullest.

ALEX

Then maybe you should lay off the

J.D.

CARTER

Don't ever fucking again tell me

what to do. I control me. Not you.

CARTER

I'm never gonna die.

BILLY

I took my driver's test this week at

the DMV...

BILLY

Got a 70. Lowest score, but I

passed. When I was done with the

test, the guy who drives with you

during the test, he goes, "Young

man, you're going to die at a

very young age."

(beat)

That true?

ALEX

Not here, not now.

(beat)

Not EVER!

BILLY

If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will

she say "no?"

ALEX

Ms. Lewton...

MS. LEWTON

Don't talk to me. You scare the hell

out of me.

TOD

(a greeting)

Hey.

ALEX

I don't want to sound gay, or

nothin, but... I miss you.

TOD

Me, too.

(beat)

But my dad doesn't understand. When

he's better; you and me, road trip

to the City. Catch the Yanks.

ALEX

That's a plan.

TOD

I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton

showed me in her class, they're

gonna let me read it. It says what

I'm feeling.

CLEAR

Because of you... I'm still alive.

Thank you.

TOD (V.O.)

We say that the hour of death

cannot be forecast...

It never occurs to us that it has

Didn't you... "see" it?

MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D)

Couldn't you "predict" it?

Couldn't you read his mind?

ALEX

Mr. Waggner...

MR. WAGGNER

You caused Tod so much guilt over

George staying on the plane that...

(breaking down)

He took his own life.

ALEX

He wouldn't do it!

ALEX

He... he told me we would be friends

again after you got better. After

you got over George. Why would he

make plans for the future if he were

planning on killing himself?

MR. WAGGNER

All my wife and I will ever know is

we wouldn't have lost our youngest

son... if you'd told our oldest to

get off the plane.

CUT TO:

CLEAR  (O.S.)

Almost Autumn.

ALEX

It's only the end of June.

CLEAR

(shrugs)

Yeah, but everthing's always in

transition. If you focus, even now,

one week into summer... you can feel

Autumn coming.

(beat)

Almost like bein' able... to see the

future.

CLEAR

Know what this is?

ALEX

Like, um... you're mad about

something?

CLEAR

A piece of debris... from the plane.

I went to the shore off the crash

site and it washed up on the beach.

ALEX

You went there? I've wanted to go

there, but I thought it was off

limits.

CLEAR

It is. But that didn't stop me.

Shouldn't stop you.

ALEX

Why were you there last night?

CLEAR

Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know

the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen

suicides. But they were there last

night, that means: one, they still

don't have a clue what caused the

crash. Two, they haven't ruled out

anything. And the fact that seven

people got off the plane is probably

weird enough, not to mention, that

one of those people had a vision, or

whatever, of it exploding minutes

before it did explode, is highly

suspicious. And it doesn't help that

the visionaries' friend just

committed suicide.

ALEX

Why were you there last night?

CLEAR

Know what this is?

CLEAR

It's you.

CLEAR

Not a likeness. It's how you make

me feel, Alex.

ALEX

I'm... really sorry.

CLEAR

Like you, the sculpture doesn't even

know what, or why, it is. Reluctant

to take form. And, yet, creating an

absolute but incomprehansible

attraction.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

Before that day, you were just

another suburban nothing that would

never have anything to do with my

life. And I'm sure you thought I was

some Marilyn Manson body-pierced

freak, or whatever.

(beat)

But at that moment... on the plane...

I felt what you felt. I didn't know

where all those emotions were coming

from until you started freaking out.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

I didn't see what you saw, but I

felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that

X-Files bullshit... but it was a

psychic connection. Why to me? Why

to you?

CLEAR

And you can still feel it, can't

you? Something from that day is

still with you. I know, because I

can still feel you.

CLEAR

That's why I was there last night.

ALEX

I've never dealt with death before.

I wasn't alive when my grandparents

died. I wish I could know. I mean,

all this... could just be in our

heads. Now it feels like it's

everywhere.

CLEAR

"It?"

ALEX

What if Tod... is just the first...

of us?

CLEAR

Is that something you're "feeling?"

ALEX

I don't know. I wish I could just see

him... one more time, then, maybe...

I would know.

CLEAR

Then, let's go see him!

CUT TO:

CLEAR

(whispering)

Gives me a rush...

ALEX

This place?!

CLEAR

Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.

CLEAR

Good call. Very "Quincy."

ALEX

That... him?

CLEAR

I think. But why'd they make him

up like... Michael Jackson?

ALEX

That's him, but... he's not here.

That... whatever... that whatever

made him Tod is gone.

ALEX                         CLEAR

MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)

Please don't yell...

MR. BLUDWORTH

You'll wake the dead.

ALEX

Why..?

MR. BLUDWORTH

Chemicals in the vascular flush

create cadaveric spasm.

ALEX

I'm... a friend of his. His best

friend. See, his father...

MR. BLUDWORTH

(ominous)

I know who you are.

CLEAR

They said he hung himself, but

there's no marks.

MR. BLUDWORTH

I crafted a reconstruction of the

Laryngeal prominence region with

Velvetone Surgical Wax and

Permaseal.

ALEX

What are all those tiny marks?

MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)

Cuticle lacerations.

ALEX

Why would he pull at the wire if he

were committing suicide?

CLEAR

Why would they say it was a

suicide... if it weren't?

ALEX

His father's pretty fucked up with

denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with

the thought of an other accident...

taking another son.

MR. BLUDWORTH

In Death...

MR. BLUDWORTH

... there are no accidents. No

coincidencess. No mishaps.

(smiles)

And no... escapes.

ALEX

You saying Tod did kill himself?

MR. BLUDWORTH

Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What

does it matter? He was going to end

someday. From the minute you're cut

loose from the womb... it's a one

way ticket on a trip to the tomb.

MR. BLUDWORTH

You may not realize it, but we're

all just a mouse that a cat has by

its tail. Every single move we

make, from the mundane to the

monumental... the red light we stop

at, or run; the people we have sex

with, or won't with us; the airplane

we ride, or walk out of... is all a

part of Death's sadistic design

leading to the grave.

ALEX

Design?

MR. BLUDWORTH

If Life is like a box of

chocolates... Death... Death is like

a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse

Trap." The day you're born is just

the boot, hanging from the

streetlamp, kicking the marble to

get things rolling. Growing up is

only the marble rolling down the

curving chute. You feel immortal

having survived school, sex, drugs

'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really

only upset the big hand holding the

steel ball that falls into the

bathtub. Marriage and kids and

career seem to make it all worthwhile

until the ball hits the see-saw and

flips the diving man into the big

barrel. In the old folks home or the

hospital you just see the big cage

rattling down until it captures...

the mouse.

(beat)

Game over.

ALEX

Maybe there's no way to win...

but... if you figured out the

game... you knew where the "steel

ball was rolling" couldn't you

avoid the trap and extend the

playing time? Couldn't you... cheat

Death at Its own game?

MR. BLUDWORTH

You already did that by walking off

the plane. Now you gotta out when

and how it'll come back at you.

(beat)

Play your hunch, Alex. If you think

you can get away from it.

(beat)

But beware the risk of cheating the

plan, disrespecting the design...

could iniciate a horrifying fury that

would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.

(beat)

And you don't even want to fuck with

that Mack Daddie.

ALEX

I'm sorry we broke in.

MR. BLUDWORTH

No harm. No foul.

CLEAR

We didn't find what we were looking

for.

ALEX

Yeah, we did.

MR. BLUDWORTH

I'll see you soon.

CUT TO:

CLEAR (O.S.)

The mortician was whacked.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

He was trippin' on formaldehyde.

ALEX

He said Death has a design. Even

before he said that I had been

seeing patterns.

CLEAR

(sarcastic)

As in flannels and plaids?

ALEX

How many died on Flight 180?

From our group?

CLEAR

Thirty-nine.

ALEX

Remember the gate number?

CLEAR

No.

ALEX

Thirty-nine.

ALEX

Remember the departure time?

CLEAR

Like... 4:25.

ALEX (V.O.)

Do you know when I was born?

CLEAR

4:25.

ALEX

Right. April 25th.

CLEAR

Wait. I thought you meant the time

of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as

in, month and day... that's a reach.

ALEX

My birthday is the same as of the

time I was meant to die! That's a

reach!?

CLEAR

You're sounding like those people

who, you know... "Oswald shot

Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in

a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in

a theatre and hid in a warehouse."

ALEX

I'm not just layin' down a bunch

of math here, with this. I'm talking

about indications... omens... that

day, that we were meant to die. That,

if, we have been aware of... would

have saved everyone on the plane.

CLEAR

That's total bullshit. You can find

death omens anywhere you want to.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a

"C" and ends with an "E." So does

the word "choke!" We're going to

choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was

a whaler. We're going to be

harpooned!

CLEAR (CONT'D)

You'll go nuts if you start with

that shit.

CLEAR

She's leaving the school. Moving

away.

ALEX

Clear, how do we know that by

just sitting here, breathing this

air or sipping the coffee, having

crossed the street... we haven't

started in motion the events that

will lead to our death? Fifty years

from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.

(beat)

You don't unless... you're able to

open yourself to the signs I'm

willing to show you.

CLEAR

I don't understand... did you see

Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?

ALEX

No, but it might as well be the

same thing. This was a message...

from someone, or something...

hinting... at the design.

CLEAR

Alex, on the plane... you must have

experienced... some kind of hyper

awareness. But here... you're

suggesting Tod's death... and maybe

our own... will happen because of...

an active Presence.

ALEX

The mortician said Death has a

design. Now... if you, me, Tod,

Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton

messed up that design, because, for

whatever reason, I was able to see

Death's plan... then we cheated it.

(beat)

But what if it was our time, what if

we were not meant to get off that

plane? What if it is still is our

time? If... It... is still not

finished with us? We will all still

die; now, not later.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Unless... we find the pattern. And

cheat it again.

CLEAR

After hearing you, just now... I do

believe...

CLEAR (CONT'D)

...that Tod killed himself.

ALEX

Then there's no one left who can help

me.

TERRY

Baby, come on... not now.

TERRY

Carter...

CARTER

Kind of have a reunion, here.

TERRY

Let it go!

CARTER

When are you moving?

MS. LEWTON

A couple of weeks.

CARTER

We're losing our favorite teacher.

Look, there's something you should

all know.

Shut up! The both of you!

TERRY (CONT'D)

They died! We lived!

Get over it! I won't let that plane

crash be the most important thing in

my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and

if you're gonna waste your life

beating the shit out of Alex

everytime you see him, then you can

just drop fucking dead!

Dad... you and mom have helped me

out, so much. But there's... some

things I need to understand before

I can talk... to anyone about it.

CNN ANCHOR (O.S.)

The National Transportation Safety

Board has a new theory tonight on the

possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180...

CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)

Deterioration of silicon insulation

on an electrical connector to the

scavenger pump may have leaked

combustible fluids.

CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)

A spark in the fuel switch...

ALEX (O.S.)

That's Tod's seat...

CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)

... may have ignited the fuel line. And

proceeded to the fuel pump.

MATCH CUT TO:

ALEX

The path of the explosion...

(a whisper)

That's Death's design.

CUT TO:

MS. LEWTON (O.S.)

Some nights I'm woken up by the

sound of my own voice, you know,

inside my head, goin', "No, you know

the whole French thing. Get on the

plane."

MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)

Everything here reminds me... of

sending Mr. Murnau back on the

plane... Right, I'm hoping a change

will help... I lived here my whole

life and wherever I looked were great

memories, you know... but now all I

can see is Mr. Murnau... those kids.

Just looking out my own front yard...

makes me feel mothing but fear.

MS. LEWTON

(quickly)

Laura, I gotta call you back.

MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)

This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent

Schreck...

TIME CUT:

SCHRECK

What are you doing?

ALEX

Checking the air in her tires to

make sure they're safe.

SCHRECK

Get in the car.

CUT TO:

ALEX

I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.

WEINE

"Next?"

ALEX

Yes... see, there's this...

pattern... that's occuring.

WEINE

(sarcastic)

Oh, you've noticed it, too?

CUT TO:

MS. LEWTON

Oh... mom's favorite.

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

He was born in the summer of his

twenty-seventh year...

SCHRECK

Where'd you get this "pattern" from?

You have another "vision?" Maybe saw

it in some T.V. static?

ALEX

I didn't ask for what happened to me

on the plane. You can make fun of me.

You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to

it. I saved six lives but the entire

school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.

ALEX

I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic

Stress. I haven't developed a

narcissistic deity complex. I'm not

going Dahmer.

(beat)

This just is. There's a pattern in

place for you. And you. There's a

design for everyone.

ALEX

(sighs)

And I'm not sure yet how... but I

intend to break this one.

CUT TO:

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

He left yesterday behind him/

You might say he's born again...

CUT TO:

WEINE

Alex, you got our attention, at

first, because you were under

suspicion in the plane explosion.

WEINE (CONT'D)

I know you didn't blow up that plane.

WEINE (CONT'D)

I don't believe you have magical

powers. No one has any... control

over life and death... unless...

that person is taking lives and

causing death.

WEINE (CONT'D)

Alex... can you promise me that

no one else will die?

ALEX

No... I can't. As long as I'm in

here, it's outta my control.

WEINE

Alright, go on. Get outta here.

SCHRECK

Kid gives me the creeps.

WEINE

We got nothing to hold him.

SCHRECK

I don't mean that...

(beat)

There's a couple of times, there...

I almost believed him.

WEINE

Sometimes, you give me the creeps.

CUT TO:

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

When he first came to the mountains,

his life was far away...

MS. LEWTON

You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's

just a stupid mug.

(composed)

You're outta here. Pretty soon...

you'll be gone.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain

High...

JOHN DENVER

I've seen it rainin' fire from the

sky...

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALEX (O.S.)

Ms. Lewton!

JOHN DENVER (V.O.)

They say that he got crazy once and

he tried to touch the sun...

ALEX

Ms. Lewton!

CUT TO:

BILLY

Hey, Alex...

CUT TO:

CLEAR

I don't know where he is. He's not

talking to me.

WEINE

Why?

CLEAR

Because I didn't believe him.

SCHRECK

If he should contact you, it

would be in the best interest

of your own safety to contact us.

CUT TO:

CLEAR

What are you doing?

CARTER

Terry's name should be on this wall.

CARTER (CONT'D)

So, why'd you want us to meet you

here? Now?

CLEAR

They're watching me, see if I go to

Alex.

BILLY

Are you?

CLEAR

They'll follow my car.

(beat)

That's why you're taking me.

CARTER

Why would I want to see him?

CLEAR

Because he knows which one of us

is next.

CUT TO:

BILLY

Um... okay... drive the speed limit,

right?

BILLY (CONT'D)

And don't pass on the right.

CARTER

Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!

You're the next one...

BILLY

(nervous)

Hey, man, why'd you say that?!

CARTER

'Cause if you say another word,

I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

CLEAR

He could be anywhere from here to a

mile down the shore. You guys drive

down there, start this way and we'll

meet around the middle. It'll take

half the time.

CUT TO:

ALEX (O.S.)

Are they up there?

ALEX (CONT'D)

Somehow... is 180 still in flight?

Somewhere... are they still safe?

CLEAR

When I was a kid, like, six or

seven... I used to worry so much

about my parents dying. Like lying

awake at night... just worrying. I

loved them so much. I didn't want

them to get hurt. And what would

happen to me? What would life be

like?

(beat)

Every night... it seemed.

ALEX

Most kids do, I guess.

CLEAR

Most kids never have it happen.

CLEAR

When I was ten... my dad went into a

7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard

somebody say "Don't turn around." So

on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was

jokin'... he did. And the guy blew

his head off.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

And, let me tell ya, I had every

reason to worry before... because

life became shit. I don't blame her,

I guess, but my mom couldn't deal

with it at all. She married this

asshole, who my mom with my real

dad would cross the street to avoid

this guy. He really didn't want a

kid. And so my mom didn't either

anymore, I guess.

(beat)

If that was the design for my

father... and my family... then fuck

Death, FUCK IT!

CLEAR (CONT'D)

And so, anyway... I've thought of

that "somewhere," Alex. It exists,

that place.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

Where my dad is still safe. Where he

had a full pack of cigerettes and

kept driving. A place where me and

my dad and my mom... are still

together....and have no idea about

this second life, here.

(beat)

A place where our friends are still

in the sky... where everyone gets a

second chance.

CLEAR (CONT'D)

But that place might only exist in

my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I

haven't experienced too many second

chances in my life. I haven't seen

any. But because of all of this, I

believe... because of you... I will

get a second chance. Because of me,

you will. With you in my life... that

place, right now existing in our

hearts, will spring out... and become

a real part of this life.

CLEAR

And that is the only way we can beat

Death... by making something special

out of Life.

ALEX

This won't be safe.

CLEAR

Those guys are probably fifteen

minutes away.

ALEX

No.. I mean, I don't have anything

on me. This won't be safe.

CLEAR

(sadly)

Nothing is... anymore.

CUT TO:

ALEX

I can't go home. After Lewton's,

they'll be after me.

CLEAR

We're takin' you to a cabin in the

woods, it's only a couple miles from

my house.

(to Carter)

Keep off the highways, they'll be

lookin' for us.

CARTER

Alright, Browning, you fuckin'

warlock... did you know about Ms.

Lewton, or what?

ALEX

Why do you think I was hiding?

CLEAR

Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you

runnin' away from her house.

ALEX

They blame me for everything. Her,

Tod, the plane crash...

BILLY

Your shoe prints were in the blood.

Your fingerprints on the knives...

ALEX

I already told you...

CARTER

(interrupting)

I'm not talkin' about if you did it.

Or if you knew she was dead...

(beat)

Did you know she was going to be

next... before she was?

ALEX

(quietly)

Yeah.

(almost to himself)

When she died... at that moment, I

could tell she saw something... horrible.

CARTER

Out of us... who's next to see it?

BILLY

Please tell me I'm gonna get to see

the Jets win the Super Bowl.

CARTER

Me, right? That's why you're not

saying.

BILLY

Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,

that time...

CARTER

(to Billy)

Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm

next.

CLEAR

He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.

CARTER

You have a responsibility to tell me.

ALEX

Is knowing going to make it easier?

It makes it harder.

CARTER

You get off havin' control over me.

Let me choose how to deal with it.

ALEX

It doesn't matter who's next...

we're all on the same list.

CARTER

Aww, fuck... really?

CARTER

Then why bother? What's the fuckin'

point? Terry and me will be back

together on the other side, so why

wait any longer?

CLEAR

Knock it off!

CARTER

May as well go out under my own

free will, right?

CLEAR

Not with us in the fuckin' car!

CLEAR                    BILLY

Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...

CARTER

What's your fuckin' worry? If it's

not your time...? I could get nailed

runnin' this red light and you all

wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?

ALEX                           CLEAR

No!                           Knock it off!

BILLY

And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!

ALEX                            CLEAR

Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself!

fuckin' maniac!!

CARTER

That's what I'm doin'!

CLEAR

I know what you're doing! It's

alright to be scared, Carter. You

don't have to prove to us how big

your balls are. Not now.

CARTER

I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S

TIME! I control my life! I control

my death!

BILLY

Watch it! Watch it!

CLEAR                   ALEX

Stop the car!              Let us out!

BILLY

I am... so close to puking, you

don't wanna know.

CLEAR

We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're

not going to quit. Maybe you are. You

act like you're not, but you are!

CLEAR

So, stop what you're doing and STOP

THIS CAR! Right fucking now!

CLEAR

Move it!

ALEX

Billy, get out!

CLEAR                          ALEX

Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it.

CLEAR

Carter, get out!

ALEX                         BILLY

Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming!

CARTER

It ain't my time.

ALEX                         CLEAR

Get out! Get out of the car!        Get out! Get out of the

Get out of the fuckin' car!         car!

CARTER

I can't get out!

BILLY

Man, he really is next.

CLEAR

Scared now?

CARTER

It broke!

BILLY

No one's that strong.

CLEAR

(to Carter)

Bullshit. He saved your life...again!

BILLY

THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE

NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM

YOU!

CARTER

SHUT UP, BILLY!

CLEAR

WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

BILLY

I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM

HIM! HE'S NEXT!

CARTER

FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!

BILLY

YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE

DEAD!

BILLY (CONT'D)

AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!

CARTER

Jesus fucking Christ!

ALEX

(to Carter)

You should have been next. After

Lewton, you should've been next.

That's the only pattern. You should

be dead.

CARTER

You're the fuckin' devil.

ALEX

(to Clear)

But I saved him. I intervened. Just

like the plane. That's the design.

CLEAR

Police are coming.

ALEX

That's why It skipped Carter and

went to the next one in the path

of the explosion; Billy.

ALEX (CONT'D)

My intervention in the death of 180

surviviors will cheat the design.

CARTER

"Intervention?" What are you, God

now?!

ALEX

Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to

die! Gods don't die! We do!

CLEAR

You're losin' it. The police will be

here. We have to go to the cabin.

You can hide there. Get your head

together.

ALEX

After Billy... it's me. And then you.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(to Clear)

Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.

CARTER

Then, get out of here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALEX

(as if to Death)

Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.

(defiant)

I overlooked it. You tried to

capitalize. But I caught you,

you fuck. I can beat you. Not

forever, but I got this cabin

rigged to beat you NOW!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WEINE

She was up there a minute ago...

CLEAR

I'm not turning him in. There's

another life that needs him now.

CLEAR

I go with you.

WEINE

You can't.

CLEAR

Don't hurt him.

WEINE

Tell us where he is. Wait at home,

and I promise... we'll bring him

back safe, in protective custody.

ALEX

I... never moved. Christa asked

me to move, but I didn't change

seats. I would've moved up...

next to Tod... How could I not

remember... that... I never

moved. Clear's seat was in front

of mine...

ALEX (CONT'D)

She's next.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SCHRECK

There!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLEAR

Run!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WEINE

(into radio)

Lost him.

SCHRECK

From the direction... there's only

one place he can heading...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALEX

Don't move!

ALEX

You're grounded in the car. Don't

touch anything. DON'T MOVE.

WEINE

Alex, get away from there!

SCHRECK

Any part of that line touches you,

you're dead.

ALEX

NO!

WEINE

Get back! You'll both die!

ALEX

You know what to do.

CLEAR

No! No! Don't!

ALEX

When I do this.. it'll have skipped

you... and it'll all be over.

ALEX

You know what to do. I'll always be

with you.

ALEX

NO!

SCHRECK

Is he alive?

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

A little more. Little more!

DOCTOR

He's here. A beautiful boy.

CLEAR

I felt him! When the baby was

born... I felt Alex pass through me...

like the night he died...

DOCTOR

13th of May... 4:25 p.m.

BARBARA

Exactly a year... to the minute.

CLEAR

We beat it, Alex.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CARTER

Alex was right.

CARTER (CONT'D)

It did skip us.

CLEAR

I believe... that's what Alex

believed. But how do we know... this

wasn't the design all along?

FADE OUT.
