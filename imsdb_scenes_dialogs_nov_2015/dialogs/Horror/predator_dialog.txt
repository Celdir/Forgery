PHILIPS

(growing serious)

We've got a real problem here,

something right up your alley.

PHILIPS

Eighteen hours ago I was

informed that one of our

choppers, transporting three

presidential cabinet members

from this charming little

country, was shot down...

(point to

the circled

area)

...The pilots radioed from the

ground that they were all

alive.  Their position was

fixed by the transponder

beacon onboard the chopper.

(points)

Here.

SCHAEFER

That's over the border,

General.

PHILIPS

(dead serious)

That's the problem.  Apparently

they strayed off course.

(pause)

We're certain they've been

captured by the guerrillas.

SCHAEFER

(quietly)

What have you got in mind,

General.

PHILIPS

We figure we've got less than

twenty-four hours to catch

up with them.  After that,

there's not much hope.  We

want a rescue operation

mounted tonight.  That doesn't

give you much time.

SCHAEFER

What else it new?  When do

we leave?

PHILIPS

You lift off in three hours.

(pause)

There's one other thing.

SCHAEFER

What's that, General?

PHILIPS

Someone else will be going

in with you.

SCHAEFER

You know we don't work with

outsiders, General.

VOICE

(o.s.)

Who said anything about

outsiders, Dutch?

DILLON

Last time we danced, it was

Lieutenant, Schaefer.

SCHAEFER

Dillon, you son of a bitch.

DILLON

(warmly)

How you been, Dutch?

SCHAEFER

You've been pushing too many

Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?

DILLON

(grinning)

No way, old buddy.

SCHAEFER

You never did know when to

quit.

DILLON

That piece of work you guys

pulled off at the Berlin

embassy last week was really

something.  Blew the entry

points on three floors and

neutralized the opposition

in eight seconds flat.

Beautiful.

SCHAEFER

Like the old days, Dillon.

DILLON

Also heard that you passed

on that little job in Libya.

SCHAEFER

Wasn't my style.  We're a

rescue unit, not assassins.

(smiles)

This must be good.  Big shot

from the CIA, leaves his desk

to come back to the bush.

What's so important?

DILLON

Those cabinet members are

very important to our scope

of operations in this part

of the world.  They're about

to get squeezed.  We can't

let that happen.  I needed

someone who could get the job

done, quick and quiet...no

screw-ups.  I needed the best.

The best.  So, I pulled a few

strings at the State

Department...and here we are.

SCHAEFER

Go on.

DILLON

The set-up is simple, Dutch.

One day job.  We pick up their

trail at the chopper, run 'em

down, grab the hostages and

bounce back across the

border before anyone knows

we were there.  You've done

it a hundred times.  Nothing

out of the ordinary.

SCHAEFER

And nothing we can't handle

alone.

PHILIPS

I'm afraid those are your

orders, Major.  Once you

reach your objective, Dillon

will evaluate the situation

and take charge.

DILLON

Not to worry, Dutch.  I

haven't lost my edge.  They've

got a head start on us in

some real tough country,

otherwise, believe me, it's

a piece of cake.

PHILIPS

Gentlemen, we're losing time.

(to Schaefer)

You'd better get your men

ready.

(pause)

Good luck, Major.

SCHAEFER

Billy's on it.

(indicates chopper)

Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated

for half-asses mountain boys.

DILLON

They're getting better equipped

every day.

BILLY

Major, looks like there were ten,

maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks

like they took some prisoners

from the chopper.

(points)

Then a different set of track,

over there.

SCHAEFER

(puzzled)

What do you mean?

BILLY

Six others, U.S. issue jungle

boots.  They came in from the

north, then followed the guerrillas.

SCHAEFER

Mean anything to you?

DILLON

Probably another rebel patrol.

They operate in here all the time.

SCHAEFER

Get ahead, see what you can find.

No sign.  They never left here

Another thing, Major, we were

lucky...couple of those guys

Good work, Mac.  Clear the

DILLON

(reacting)

Two days...that's all we had.

In two days, three hundred of

these bastards would have been

equipped with all this.  After

they crossed the border, it

would have taken a year to

stop them.

(looks up)

We've averted a major

guerrilla invasion, Dutch...

SCHAEFER

(slow; deliberate)

It was all bullshit.  All of it.

From the start...you set us up,

got us in here to do your

dirty work.

DILLON

That's right, I set you up.

You're a veteran at this, Dutch,

I had to.

SCHAEFER

Why us?

We've been lookin' for this

must have gotten close when

they got shot down.  Hopper                        *

was sent in to get my men.

He was just doing his job.

When he disappeared I had to

clean this up,  I had to stop

there bastards.  We were so

close, we couldn't quit.  We

couldn't sleep through this

one.  I needed you, Dutch,

can't you see that?

DILLON

To invade a foreign country,

illegally?  You lied, Dillon.

Stacked the odds against us.  Set

us up.  You could have gotten

us all killed.

(pause; looking at him)

You used to be one of us,

Dillon, someone I could trust

with my life...

DILLON

We've been through a lot together

Dutch.  When we were together, no                  *

one could stop us, the hottest                     *

Goddamned team the army ever saw.                  *

But things changed, I woke up.

We're fighting them in a dozen

Goddamned countries.  It's a

fight we can't lose, Dutch.  We're

all expendable assets, can't you

see that?

SCHAEFER

That's your problem, Dillon.

You always did put ambition

before the lives of your men.

(pause)

My men are not expendable.  I

don't do this kind of work.
