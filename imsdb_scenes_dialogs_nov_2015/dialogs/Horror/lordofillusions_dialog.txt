"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive Barker

CUT WIDE TO;

BUTTERFIELD

(softly)

Swann...?

BUTTERFIELD

Master?

NIX

And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,

you're my instrument. From now on,

you'll be called the Puritan...

CULTISTS

(murmuring)

Puritan...

CULTISTS

Yes...

BUTTERFIELD

Master?

BUTTERFIELD

Swann's here.

NIX

(to Cultists)

We'll come back to this. Get about

your business.

NIX

Hush...

NIX

I said hush.

GIRL

Please.  Let me go.

NIX

(to Baboon)

What is it?

NIX

(to Girl)

I think he's in love.

GIRL

Keep it away from me.

GIRL

Please... please...

BUTTERFIELD

(also watching, wide-

eyed)

Want me to shoot Swann?

NIX

You don't like him, do you?

BUTTERFIELD

He wants your magic.

NIX

Maybe.  Go fetch him.

GIRL

What are you going to do?

CUT TO:

SWANN

(to all three)

Are we ready?

JENNIFER

(cool)

Say the word.

PIMM

(very nervous)

Look, maybe we should think this over.

SWANN

No.  He's gone too far.

PIMM

So he took a child.

JENNIFER

He'll kill her.

PIMM

No he won't.

SWANN

(determined)

He's not going to get the chance.

QUAID

If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

SWANN

So stay out here.

BUTTERFIELD

He's expecting you.

SWANN

(to others)

Look around.  If you find 'the

child, yell.  She's got blonde

hair, that's all I know.

1ST MAN

Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you

weren't coming back.

QUAID

I changed my mind.

1ST WOMAN

Come and join us.

SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST

(angry)

Don't do that!

JENNIFER

Don't be afraid.

BARBARA

I'm not... want to see?

PIMM

He's going to kill us all...

JENNIFER

Where did Swann go?

QUAID

Stay the fuck away!

(yells)

Pimm!  Get over here!

SWANN

You're going to be okay.

NIX

I knew you'd come.

NIX

I've got so much power to give

you, Swann.  All you have to do

is...beg.

SWANN

Fuck you.

NIX

You don't think I've got it to

give?

SWANN

No!

NIX

You're wrong.

NIX

I could eat your fucking soul,

Swann.

JENNIFER

Fuck!

NIX

You want to know what the world

really looks like?

NIX

Want to see flesh with a god's

eyes?

SWANN (V.O.)

Aah!

QUAID

Get away from the door!

QUAID

Swann?

NIX

(to Quaid)

Here he is.

NIX

Take a look, Swann!  These are your

friends.

JENNIFER (V.O.)

What have you done to him?

SWANN'S P.O.V.

QUAID (V.O.)

Swann.  It's okay.

SWANN

Don't touch me.  He's got... got

into my head.

NIX

You want to be like that, Swann?

Mud and shit?

NIX

Come here.  Share the power.

NIX

(raging, terrifying)

Swann!  Swann!

NIX

(a roar)

Help me!

SWANN

Jesus-

1ST CULTIST

(with distressing

confidence)

You can't kill him.

2ND CULTIST

He'll just rise up again!

NIX

Help me!

JENNIFER

Quickly!

NIX

(seeing)

Swann?  What are you doing?

SWANN

Binding you.

NIX

Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

NIX

Sw

GIRL

(quietly)

Is it finished?

SWANN

It's finished.

PIMM

Dead?

QUAID

Dead.

PIMM

What now?

SWANN

We bury him so deep no one will

ever find him.

CUT TO:

FADE OUT

FADE IN

BLONDE GIRL

How'd you spell that again?

HARRY

D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry

D'Amour.

BLONDE GIRL

D'Amour.

HARRY

Right.

BLONDE GIRL

Isn't that French for something?

BELLBOY

Mister D'Amour?

HARRY

(to Blonde)

Yeah.  It's French.

BLONDE GIRL

For love, right?

BELLBOY

Mister D'Amour?

HARRY

(to Blonde)

Right.

BLONDE GIRL

(grinning)

That's so cool.

BELLBOY

Mister D'Amour?

HARRY

Yeah?

BELLBOY

You haven't paid the cab.  He won't

give us your bags 'til you pay him.

HARRY

How much?

BELLBOY

Thirty-five bucks.

HARRY

Tell him he can keep them. The

Bellboy looks puzzled.

HARRY

Just kidding.

HARRY

I've got my life in there.

HARRY

Hello, L.A.

BELLBOY

Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

HARRY

You bet.

HARRY

Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either

got a great sense of humour or he's

paying her to laugh.

(looks at hamburger in

disgust)

Jesus.

HARRY

(into tape recorder)

He's finished.

HARRY

(into tape)

Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off

again.

CUT  TO:

HARRY

Superstitious?

TAPERT (V.O.)

Oh my God!

QUAID (V.O.)

Ahh. . .

MILLER

Fuckhead.

HARRY

What the fuck!?

HARRY

Shit!

HARRY

(to Butterfield)

Don't touch him."

BUTTERFIELD

What are you going to do about it?

BUTTERFIELD

(to Harry)

Ever watched a man die?  If you

watch very closely, you can

sometimes see the soul escaping.

And if you're very quick, you can

catch it.

QUAID

Please... Butterfield... I wasn't

there.  Ask Pimm.

BUTTERFIELD

Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's

disappeared.  They knew the Puritan

was coming home.

BUTTERFIELD

So do you.  You've seen the future.

Haven't you?

QUAID

Yes.

BUTTERFIELD

And are you afraid?

QUAID

Yes.

QUAID

(to Harry)

Don't leave me.

HARRY

You need an ambulance.

QUAID

(in pain)

Too late.  Why are you here? Did

you cone... up here for a reading?

HARRY

NO ... I...

QUAID

(quietly)

My God.

HARRY

What?

QUAID

You've taken some strange

journeys in your life.

HARRY

Yeah.  You could say that.

QUAID

You're drawn to the dark side, over

and over.  And it's drawn to you.

(looks at Harry)

You don't like that.

HARRY

Not much.

QUAID

You can't change it.  You have to

walk...

(coughs)

...walk the line between Heaven and

Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept

it.

HARRY

Hold on.

QUAID

I'm not afraid to die.  There's

something terrible... coming

home...

HARRY

The Puritan?

QUAID

Yes...

HARRY

Who is he?

HARRY

(softly; sadly)

Shit.

EDDISON

(to Harry)

What were you doing up there?

HARRY

I'm a private detective.  I was

hired to follow somebody for a few

days.  A guy called Tapert.

Insurance fraud.

EDDISON

(writing)

Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,

Butterfield.

HARRY

Tapert's got nothing to do with

this.  He came here to get his palm

read.

EDDISON

What makes you so sure?

HARRY

(shrugs)

I got a file on him two inches

thick.  He's a petty fraudster.

This is something else.  Ever heard

of someone called the Puritan?

EDDISON

New one on me.

(to Officer)

Okay.  Let's see him.

EDDISON

Where the fuck is he?

HARRY

He got up and walked.

EDDISON

(looking up at window)

After that fall?. He must have

broken half his bones.

HARRY

I don't think he'd have given a

shit.

CUT TO:

BUTTERFIELD

D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know

that name?

MILLER

I know him.  I saw him.

MILLER

I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got

possessed and he saved the little

bastard's life.

BUTTERFIELD

He's a priest?

MILLER

No.  He's just a guy who's got a

nose for this shit.

(a beat.  A smirk)

Like you.

BUTTERFIELD

I don't want him getting in the

way.

MILLER

He won't.

BUTTERFIELD

(dreamily)

We've all of us waited too long to

have the homecoming spoiled.

MILLER

What do you mean, "all of us?"

BUTTERFIELD

You didn't think it was just going

to be you and me?  A lot of people

believed in Nix. They haven't

forgotten his promise.

MILLER

About?

BUTTERFIELD

Death.

MILLER

What about death?

BUTTERFIELD

(a beat)

It's an illusion.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RADIO

"I really want to see you, Lord,

And it won't take long, my Lord, My

sweet Lord..."

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLEMENZIA

Coffee, Mrs. Swann?

DOROTHEA

Thank you.

DOROTHEA

Where's Mr. Swann?

CLEMENZIA

In his study.

(a beat)

He got something on his mind?

DOROTHEA

Why?

CLEMENZIA

Bad mood today.

DOROTHEA (V.O.)

(softly)

Hey...

DOROTHEA

Bad show last night?

SWANN

(wearily)

The usual.  Full house. Standing

ovation.  I tell them it's magic...

DOROTHEA

(distastefully)

... they believe you.

SWANN

Yeah.

(a beat)

Remember Quaid?

DOROTHEA

Sure.

SWANN

Somebody killed him.

DOROTHEA

Oh God.

SWANN

(disturbed)

I just saw him.

SWANN

I'm putting in a new illusion

tonight.  Will you be there?

DOROTHEA

Sure.  You want me to find out

about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?

SWANN

No.

(superstitiously)

I'm not going near him.

VALENTIN

Higher.  Another inch.  The left

hand side's too low.

DOROTHEA

Valentin?

VALENTIN

(to Hangers)

Good.  There.

(to Dorothea)

Yes?

DOROTHEA

(gives him the newspaper)

You saw this?

DOROTHEA

I want you to find this man D'Amour

for me.

HARRY

(waking)

What...?

HARRY

Shit.

VALENTIN (V.O.)

Mr. D'Amour?

HARRY

Go away.

VALENTIN (V.O.)

It's one in the afternoon.

HARRY

What are you, my mother?

VALENTIN (V.O.)

I need to speak to you, Mr.

D'Amour.  About last night.

HARRY

Whatever I said, I didn't mean it,

okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

VALENTIN

We've never met.

HARRY

Then what do you want?

VALENTIN

I'm here to offer you a job.

HARRY

I'm going back to New York in--

(consults his watch)

Shit!  I'm outta here.

VALENTIN

Have you got a job that'll pay you

five thousand a day?

HARRY

Do I get lunch?

CUT TO:

HARRY

Whose is the car?

VALENTIN

Mine.

HARRY

Nah.  You're driving it too

carefully.

VALENTIN

(sparring)

Maybe I just bought it.

HARRY

Somebody's been smoking in here for

months.

HARRY

Havanas.  You're not the

smoker.  So who is?

VALENTIN

(laughs)

You could almost pass for a

detective, D'Amour.

(a beat)

I work for the best illusionist in

the world.

HARRY

Philip Swann?

VALENTIN

You know of him?

HARRY

I saw him in Vegas once.

VALENTIN

Are you a gambling man?

HARRY

When I can afford to lose. Swann's

quite a magician.

VALENTIN

Never call him that.  He's strictly

an illusionist.

HARRY

What's the difference?

VALENTIN

Illusions are trickery. Magicians

do it for real.

HARRY

Any movie stars buried here?

VALENTIN

Probably.

HARRY

It's not a bad place.  Warm.

Great view.

VALENTIN

I don't think the dead much care.

HARRY

Are you sure?

VALENTIN

Are you a believer, then?

HARRY

I've signed on for them all in my

time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't

have too many saviours.

HARRY

Who is she?

VALENTIN

Swann's wife.

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA

I want you to help me help my

husband.  I know he's in some kind

of trouble.  And it's something to

do with the man you saw murdered.

HARRY

Did your husband know Quaid?

DOROTHEA

Yes.  They weren't close, but they

saw each other once in a while.  I

think Philip believes all that

stuff with the tarot cards.

HARRY

You don't?

DOROTHEA

I think we make our own futures.

HARRY

What's the connection?

DOROTHEA

(covering now, but well)

I don't exactly know.

Philip doesn't like to talk about

the past.

HARRY

Why not?

DOROTHEA

He's a secretive man.

HARRY

And you don't ask questions?

DOROTHEA

We don't share our lives the way a

lot of people do.

HARRY

Does that mean...?

DOROTHEA

We haven't slept in the same bed

for years.

HARRY

But obviously you still care what

happens to him.

DOROTHEA

We wouldn't be having this

conversation if I didn't. Swann's

one of the most remarkable men

alive.

DOROTHEA

You don't believe me.

HARRY

He's an illusionist.  It's not

exactly brain surgery.

HARRY

Sorry.  You asked.

DOROTHEA

No.  You're right.  He could have

been something more. Maybe a lot

more.  But people get lost.  Even

good people. Too much fame.  Too

much money,

HARRY

Where do I sign?

DOROTHEA

Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

HARRY

Harry.

DOROTHEA

Harry.

HARRY

I'm no bodyguard.

DOROTHEA

That's not what I'm asking for. I

want somebody who can find out what

Philip saw in those damn cards.

And stop it from happening.

HARRY

When do you want me to start?

DOROTHEA

Come to the show with me. Tonight I

want you to see him with an

audience.  They love him.

HARRY

Do you?

DOROTHEA

I didn't marry him for love, Mr.

D'Amour.  Tonight?

HARRY

Sure.

CUT TO:

HARRY

You're not listening to me, Loomis.

CUT TO:

LOOMIS

The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's

given us a full confession.  Get

your ass back to Mew York.

HARRY

No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks'

vacation.

LOOMIS

You never took a fucking vacation

in your life, Harry. What's going

on?

HARRY

I got to go.  I'm late.

LOOMIS

Call me tomorrow.

HARRY

There's other guys as good as me,

Loomis.

LOOMIS

Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.

HARRY

A couple of weeks.

LOOMIS

One question.

HARRY

What?

LOOMIS

Who is she?

LOOMIS

I thought so.  'Night, Harry.

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA

I'm glad you could make it.

HARRY

Hey, this is a big deal for me. You

know what seats like this cost in

New York?

SWANN

Valentin!

SWANN

(irritated)

Valentin!

VALENTIN

I'm here.

SWANN

The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who

I think it is?

SWANN

He's young.

1ST TECHNICIAN

(to Swann)

Ready?

SWANN

Ready.

1ST TECHNICIAN

How the fuck does he do that?

2ND TECHNICIAN

It's wires, man.

1ST TECHNICIAN

I never seen no wires.

2ND TECHNICIAN

(sarcastic)

So what is it?  Magic?

SWANN (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen.  You are

standing on the threshold of a

miracle...

SWANN

My friends ... come with me...into

the Great Beyond.

HARRY

He's good.

DOROTHEA

You haven't seen anything yet.

DOROTHEA

(a whisper)

This is the new illusion.

HARRY

There's something wrong...

DOROTHEA

No. . .

1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER

What happened?

2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER

It's a trick.

3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER

Somebody help him.

DOROTHEA

(to Harry)

I've got to get to him!

HARRY

Out of the way!  Out of the way!

VALENTIN

(to Stage Manager)

Get then out of here, for God's

sake --

STAGE MANAGER

You heard him!  It's not a fucking

show!

STAGE MANAGER

Who are you?

MILLER

Psst!

DOROTHEA

(softly)

Swann...

DOCTOR

I'm a doctor.  Let me through.

DOCTOR

(to Dorothea)

I'm sorry...

HARRY

Hey!

MILLER

Got you, fucker!

BUTTERFIELD

Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed

Swann?

HARRY

You did.

(a beat)

Didn't you?

BUTTERFIELD

Why would I do that?

HARRY

Beats me.

BUTTERFIELD

You don't have a clue what you're

into, do you?

HARRY

Deep shit?

BUTTERFIELD

Who did this?

HARRY

I told you --

BUTTERFIELD

Who did this?

HARRY

(raises his hand)

All right.  It was...

HARRY

(feigning a near collapse)

... it was...

BUTTERFIELD

Aah!

HARRY

Deep shit...

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EDDISON

And this Butterfield guy--

HARRY

--vanished.

EDDISON

(frustrated sigh)

Another fucking magician. Jesus.

HARRY

Are you finished with me?

EDDISON

For now.  Are you planning to go

back to New York?

HARRY

(watching Dorothea)

No.  Not yet...

HARRY

Are they treating you okay?

DOROTHEA

(nods)

I heard what happened.  It looks

like somebody murdered him.

HARRY

I'm sorry I got into this too late.

But if you want me to stick around,

maybe dig where the cops don't

look...

DOROTHEA

I don't know where you'd start.

HARRY

Well... how about some of the other

illusionists?

DOROTHEA

They won't tell you anything.

HARRY

I can be very persuasive.

DOROTHEA

(a beat)

Yes.  I think you probably can.

(another beat)

We'd need to talk about your fee.

HARRY

Forget the fee.  If I find

Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about

money.  If I don't...

(he shrugs)

...my gamble.  Either way... I

get to spend some time... here.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Where'd you learn that?

WILDER

What?

HARRY

(points)

That.

WILDER

At birth.  I don't know you --

HARRY

Harry D'Amour.

WILDER

I know all the kids coming up. Got

to stay ahead of the game. But I

don't know you.

HARRY

I'm in from New York.  I came to

see Swann.

WILDER

What a tragedy.  It was just a

matter of time, of course, but it's

not good for the business.

HARRY

Was he taking a lot of risks?

WILDER

You don't know the half of it. I'm

Walter Wilder, by the way.

HARRY

Not the Walter Wilder?

WILDER

The one and only.

WILDER

Want to try?

WILDER

You know Vinovich?

HARRY

(not a clue)

Sure.  Vivovich.

WILDER

He knew Swann way back.  He says

there were a lot of drugs, a lot of

crazy shit.

HARRY

I'd love to... you know... hang

with some of you guys.

WILDER

People are pretty cagey.  Who do

you know?

HARRY

For what?

WILDER

For an introduction.

HARRY

Well... nobody.

WILDER

(magnanimously)

You do now.

HARRY

I only wear ties for funerals.

WILDER

You don't get in without one. It's

like a gentlemen's club for

illusionists.  Except most of us

aren't gentlemen.

HARRY

Are they all in the business?

WILDER

It's not a business. Harry. It's a

vocation.

WILDER

That's what they call the

Repository.  Every magic secret

known to man's locked up in that

room.

HARRY

Have you been in?

WILDER

No.  There's only three keys.

Vinovich has got one, of

course.

(beat)

He's a little crazy, by the way.

And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,

he's a real charmer.

CUT TO

VINOVICH

It's more than entertainment. We're

opening people's heads up.  Putting

miracles back into their boring

little lives.

BILLY

But they're fake miracles.

VINOVICH

Houdini believed he had spirit

guides.

HARRY

You believe that?

VINOVICH

I think we walk a narrow path,

between... between...

HARRY

Heaven and Hell?

VINOVICH

Trickery and divinity.

HARRY

Are you saying that sometimes

the miracles are real?

VINOVICH

No.  I'm saying they were always

fake.  The saints, the messiahs,

they were just illusionists.

HARRY

So could you walk on water?

VINOVICH

(deadly serious)

I could reproduce any miracle

that's ever been performed, with a

little preparation.

HARRY

What about Swann's miracles?

VINOVICH

They weren't worth a damn.

HARRY

(goading)

I heard he was the best.

VINOVICH

If he was so good why's he so dead?

HARRY

You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd

maybe have a theory.

VINOVICH

Oh, I've got plenty.

HARRY

I'd like to hear them.

VINOVICH

I'm not saying another word.

(to Wilder)

You damn fool.  He's a

journalist.

HARRY

Just tell me about Swann.  Or are

you too scared?

VINOVICH

He was a freak.  Everything he did

was tainted.

HARRY

With what?

VINOVICH

Evil.  He was evil.

(to Laura)

Come on.

VINOVICH

(to the rest)

Say nothing to this man if you wish

to keep my company.

HARRY

Great accent, by the way.  Is it

Brooklyn?

VINOVICH

(pure Brooklyn)

Fuck you.

BILLY (V.O.)

Harry!

BILLY

I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich

sees me talking to you.  He's an

asshole, but he's a powerful

asshole.

HARRY

They go together.

BILLY

(lowered voice)

I've heard a name.  Someone they

talk about in whispers.

HARRY

Who?

BILLY

Nix.

HARRY

Nix?

BILLY

Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

HARRY

Who is he?

BILLY

I think maybe he taught Swann.

(hands Harry a card)

This is me.  See ya around.

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA (V.O.)

... I want somebody who can find

out what Philip saw in those damn

cards...

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTTERFIELD

Ever watched a man die?

QUAID

Please... I wasn't there... Ask

Pimm.

BUTTERFIELD

Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's

disappeared...

BACK TO:

CUT TO:

QUAID

I'm not afraid to die.  There's

something terrible... coming

home...

BACK TO:

HARRY

Shit!

HARRY

This is D'Amour.

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA

Harry... I know it's late.

HARRY

That's okay.

DOROTHEA

How did it go today?

HARRY

I went up to the Magic Castle. You

were right.  He didn't have a lot

of fans up there.

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA (V.O.)

They were jealous of him.

HARRY (V.O.)

Why?  Because he had you?

BACK TO:

DOROTHEA

He... didn't have me..  I told you-

HARRY

You didn't marry him for love.

HARRY

So why did you marry him?

DOROTHEA

That's my business. Harry.

HARRY

Just curious.

(a beat)

Back to business.  Ever heard of a

man called Nix?

(silence)

Dorothea?

DOROTHEA

Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't

know the name.

HARRY

What about Jennifer Desiderio?

DOROTHEA

It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to

go.

HARRY

Okay.  I'll keep digging.

DOROTHEA

(uneasy)

Yes.  You do that.

BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)

If you watch very closely, you can

sometimes see the soul escaping.

HARRY

(smiles)

Yes...

HARRY (CONT'D)

Desiderio...

HARRY (CONT'D)

What the fuck are you doing here?

VALENTIN

Looking for you.  I tried the

hotel.

HARRY

Why'd you come here?

VALENTIN

You're a detective, with no clues.

Where else are you going to look?

I'm going to keep this brief.

(he takes out an envelope)

Here's thirty thousand dollars.

HARRY

What for?

VALENTIN

A ticket home,

HARRY

You didn't hire me.  She did.

If she wants me off the job, I

want to hear it from her.

VALENTIN

She doesn't want to see you. She's

had enough pain.  Enough churning

over the past.  She wants it all

left alone.

HARRY

Left alone?  Somebody's been

murdered.

VALENTIN

Yes.  It's regrettable

HARRY

Fuck regrettable!  I want to know

why.

VALENTIN

What for?  You need to stay busy?

HARRY

(a confession)

I like to know why things happen.

VALENTIN

Why people die?

(shakes his head)

Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

HARRY

No.

VALENTIN

Don't try and see her, D'Amour.

Just leave her alone.  Let her

heal.

HARRY

Lock up, will you?

CUT TO:

TOFFLER

Jennifer's only ever had one

visitor.

HARRY

A Mister Quaid?

TOFFLER

Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I

saw it on the news. Jennifer

doesn't know.  And frankly, this

isn't the best tine for her to be

told.

HARRY

I won't say anything.

TOFFLER

Jennifer's been with us four years.

She was coming on nicely.

But just the last month or so,

she's worse than ever.

HARRY

What's her problem?

TOFFLER

She has no real grip on reality.

HARRY

(a joke)

Does anybody?

TOFFLER

(deadly serious)

Oh yes.  We have to agree what's

real and what's not. That's what

holds us together.

HARRY

And what does Jennifer think's

real?

TOFFLER

(quietly)

Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming

for her.

(louder)

Jennifer?

JENNIFER

Have we met before?

HARRY

No.

JENNIFER

Only I forget.  They give me pills,

you know, to keep me... even...

and... I forget things,

HARRY

Well, you didn't forget me.  I just

came because I wanted to know if

you knew a man called Butterfield.

JENNIFER

Maybe... I... don't...

HARRY

What about Philip Swann?

JENNIFER

I knew Swann.

(sudden vehemence)

He's a fucking liar.

HARRY

Why's that?

JENNIFER

He said he knew how to protect us.

But he didn't know anything.  He

made us think it was over and done

with.

HARRY

What is?

JENNIFER

(tears nearing)

I don't want to think about it. If

I think about it he'll hear me.

He'll find me.

HARRY

Swann?

JENNIFER

I told you.  I don't --

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

(screaming)

God no!  Oh God no!

NURSE

Calm down!

JENNIFER

He's not going to get me!

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

He's not!  He's not!

HARRY

Who's not?

JENNIFER

Nix! Nix!

HARRY

Is he the Puritan?

JENNIFER

Yes! Yes!

HARRY

And he's dead?

JENNIFER

No.  He's coming back.  He's

digging his way out!

NURSE

I'll take care of her now.

NURSE

Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

HARRY

Jennifer!

HARRY

Jesus.

HARRY

(very quietly)

Jesus.

HARRY

I want to speak to Dorothea.

VALENTIN (V.O.)

I'm afraid she's not in.

HARRY

When will she be in?

DOROTHEA

Who is it?

VALENTIN

Crank call.  I'll get the number

changed.

DOROTHEA

No word from D'Amour?

VALENTIN

It's better he's gone.  He would

have done more harm than good.

DOROTHEA

Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,

so.  Try him again at the hotel.

VALENTIN

I left three messages already.

HARRY

(on phone)

Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I

wanted to get into the repository

at the Magic Castle?

CUT TO:

HARRY

You've done this before.

BILLY

I've had my moments.

BILLY

I'm sure they'll have this place

rigged.

HARRY

How?

BILLY

It'll be something hokey.

BILLY

Houdini'd been proud of you.

BILLY

(impressed)

Whoa...

BILLY

I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

HARRY

You heard right.

BILLY

You ever been married?

HARRY

Yeah.  She was killed in a car

crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She

was filing for divorce.

BILLY

Why?

HARRY

My life was too weird for her.

BILLY

(grinning)

I love weird.

HARRY

Billy?  This was on Miller's

forehead.  Any idea what it is?

BILLY

Nope.

BILLY

What did I tell you?  So fucking

hokey.

HARRY

What have we got here?

HARRY

Grab the files!

BILLY

Jesus!

BILLY

I could have lost my fucking hands.

HARRY

That would have kept you out of the

Magic Circle.

(he studies the files)

Which was presumably the idea.

(a beat)

These are about Nix.

HARRY

You go through these.  Go on!

HARRY

Wait a minute...

HARRY

That's Butterfield...

BILLY

(points to nan in)

doorway)

And who's that?

HARRY

At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

BILLY

Take a look at this.

HARRY

(looking at it)

A Nix specialty?

BILLY

I don't know any of these tricks...

HARRY

(a slow burn)

Maybe they're not tricks.

BILLY

(mystified)

I mean, there's no instructions--

(realizes what Harry said)

What do you mean, they're not

tricks?

HARRY

What did Vinovich say? Something

about walking a path between --

BILLY

Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he

says that all the time.

HARRY

That's because he knew.  He'd seen

these files and knew.

BILLY

Knew what?

BILLY

Harry!

BILLY

Where the fuck are you?

HARRY

Okay.  Hold it right there.

BILLY

(in mortal terror)

Get it off me!

HARRY

Hokey enough for you?

BILLY

I'm out of here, man!  Are you

coming?

HARRY

I'm coming.

HARRY

Ah, shaddup!

CUT TO:

HARRY

Thanks, Billy.

BILLY

Hey, anytime.

(a beat)

Actually, no.  This was enough.

VALENTIN

(quietly)

I can't let you in.

HARRY

(stepping in)

Yeah, I know.

VALENTIN

You want more money, is that it?

HARRY

Dorothea?

VALENTIN

Leave her alone --

HARRY

Shut up!

DOROTHEA

This is the way he wanted it... no

autopsy, no embalming. Nobody

meddling with his body...

DOROTHEA

Flesh is a trap.  That's what he

used to say.  Flesh is a trap and

magic sets us free.

(a beat)

Why did you come back?

HARRY

I didn't leave.  I was just digging

around.

DOROTHEA

(uneasy)

What did you find?

HARRY

Jennifer Desiderio, for one.

(he watches her for a

response)

She threw herself in front of a car

this afternoon.

DOROTHEA

Oh Christ.

HARRY

(a beat)

Why don't you tell me the truth?

HARRY

Nix ran some kind of cult, right?

Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

DOROTHEA

It was more than that, I think.

HARRY

He was the real thing, right?

DOROTHEA

Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

HARRY

Stuff?

DOROTHEA

He could get into people's heads.

Make them see things. Terrible

things.  And he could levitate.

Juggle fire.

HARRY

He taught all this to Swann?

DOROTHEA

Some or it.

HARRY

So Swann was performing magic. not

illusions?

(Dorothea nods)

And what?  You thought he should be

using it to cure cancer, not making

millions.

DOROTHEA

I told you --

HARRY

Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess

that'd turn anybody's head.

Including yours.

DOROTHEA

No.

HARRY

You said you weren't with him for

love.

DOROTHEA

I wasn't.

HARRY

What then?

DOROTHEA

I was grateful to him.  I owed him

my life.  And he loved me. He

couldn't always show it, but he

felt it.

HARRY

He thought Nix was coming back,

didn't he?

DOROTHEA

Shit!

HARRY

(reassuring)

It's okay.

DOROTHEA

No it isn't.  You can't help me.

HARRY

(tenderly)

I'm here, aren't I?

HARRY

Nothing's going to happen to you.

DOROTHEA

(seductive)

Nothing?

HARRY

(smiles)

Nothing you don't want.

DOROTHEA

(whispers)

I was so afraid.

HARRY

Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

DOROTHEA

Are you sure?

HARRY

I'm sure.

(kisses her)

He's dead.

DOROTHEA

I know.  I'm the one who shot

him.

DOROTHEA

I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,

to get Swann to come to him.

HARRY

(realizing)

And they all came...

DOROTHEA

Yes.

HARRY

Quaid and Jennifer--

DOROTHEA

And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was

ready for them.

DOROTHEA

(nervous)

What was that?

HARRY

It's okay.

HARRY

Valentin?

DOROTHEA

Harry?  Wait!

HARRY

What the hell-?

HARRY

(in pain)

Aah!

DOROTHEA

It's him!  It's Nix!

HARRY

Valentin!  Get some lights on!

HARRY

Somebody you know?

DOROTHEA

Oh my God!

HARRY

Which goes first?  My face or

your heart?

DOROTHEA

Who in God's name are you?

DOROTHEA

Are you all right?

HARRY

Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him

in here!

VALENTIN

What are you doing?  This is

sacrilege.

VALENTIN

Are you satisfied now?

HARRY

No.

DOROTHEA

Harry?

HARRY

It's all right.  It's not

hurting...

HARRY

...plaster doesn't bleed.

HARRY

(to Dorothea)

It looks like you're not a widow

after all.

HARRY

You rigged the illusion to fail,

right?

VALENTIN

Yes.

HARRY

You paid off the doctor.  You set

up the fake body.  Yes?

VALENTIN

Yes.

HARRY

And then... because I was

getting too close to something --

(at Dorothea)

--or someone, you called Swann

VALENTIN

I tried to pay you off.

HARRY

Was that Swann's idea?

VALENTIN

No.  It was mine.  I didn't want

any more bloodshed. That's why we

went to all this trouble, so

there'd be no one for Nix to come

after.

HARRY

Nix is dead and buried, for

fuck's sake.

VALENTIN

Haven't you seen enough to know

that doesn't matter?

HARRY

I want to see Swann face to face.

VALENTIN

Why don't you leave this alone? Let

everybody think it's over?

DOROTHEA

What about me?

VALENTIN

Nix was never interested in you.

It was always Swann.

HARRY

(to Dorothea)

Maybe Valentin's right.  We should

let it alone.

HARRY

(con't.)

He went to all that trouble to be

dead.  Maybe we should let him stay

that way.

1ST WORKER

Watch out!

VALENTIN

Who's there?

BUTTERFIELD

(conversationally)

I've sometimes thought, if I'd had

another profession, I would have

been a surgeon.

BUTTERFIELD

To be able to heal with one little

cut.

VALEMTIN

No. . .

BUTTERFIELD

Let's say those eyes of yours were

giving you trouble.

VALENTIN

Please.

BUTTERFIELD

I could scoop them out.

VALENTIN

Don't.

BUTTERFIELD

So tell me where Nix is buried.

VALENTIN

I don't know.

VALENTIN

Wait!

VALENTIN

I'll tell you.

BUTTERFIELD

You'll do more.than that.

HARRY

I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay

away.

HARRY

You had to see who wept for you the

most.

HARRY

A lot of people are going to be

really pissed off when they

discover you're still alive.

SWANN (V.O.)

They'll never find out.

HARRY

Look, Ma, no wires.

SWANN

You shouldn't have followed me,

D'Amour.

HARRY

How the fuck do you do that?

SWANN

Now I'm going to have to kill you.

HARRY

I don't think so.  You need me

alive.

SWANN

Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

HARRY

Be careful.  Funerals make me

trigger-happy.

HARRY

You know, it's such a fucking

waste.  You can do shit most of us

can only dream about, and you go

around pretending it's some trick.

SWANN

Illusionists get. Las Vegas

contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get

burned.

HARRY

Or murdered, like Nix.

SWANN

He deserved it.

HARRY

Maybe he doesn't see it that way.

Maybe he's digging his

way out of the hole you put him

right now.  That's what you're

hiding away from, isn't it?

SWANN

I did it for Dorothea.

HARRY

Oh yeah?

SWANN

Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's

off her.

HARRY

So Nix won't come looking for her?

SWANN

It's me betrayed him.

HARRY

And she shot him I  I think that'd

piss me off if I were Nix.

SWANN

(despairing)

I don't know what else to do.

HARRY

Help me.

HARRY

Listen.  If he's back from the

dead, then he is some kind of god.

And he'll find you, wherever the

fuck you are.

And if he's just another phony

Messiah, then you can stage the

greatest come-back in history.

CUT TO:

SWANN

Is this the best brandy you've

got?

CASHIER

If that's what's on the shelves.

SWANN

Can you change a thousand for me?

CASHIER

(amazed)

You're shittin' me.

HARRY

Can we go?

HARRY

Oh Jeez.

SWANN

Will that do?  No?

SWANN

That better?

CUT TO:

SHOCK CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BACK TO:

DOROTHEA

Who's there?

VALENTIN

I'm sorry.

DOROTHEA

Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do

to your face?

BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)

It was me.

BUTTERFIELD

Guess who we're going to see?

SWANN

You think I'm an asshole.

HARRY

Didn't know you read minds.

SWANN

(a warning)

I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour.

But you know that.

(an apology)

So I like playing games with

people.  Gives them something to

wonder about...

HARRY

Is that all?

SWANN

I distract them from their banality

for a few minutes. It's like a

public service.  It doesn't mean

much in the end. They're all going

to die.

HARRY

And you're not?

SWANN

Oh, I was going to discover the

secret of the universe.  That's why

I liked Nix.  He promised me all

these explanations.

HARRY

And he didn't have them?

SWANN

He had something.  He showed me how

to bend the rules.  A little

levitation.  A few fireworks.

HARRY

Is that all?

SWANN

No.

(a beat)

At the end... when we had him

cornered, he got into my head. He

showed me what we really look like,

when the veneer's gone.  Jelly.

Shit...

HARRY

And you believed him?

SWANN

I saw it with my own fucking eyes!

See, that's his best trick.  No

illusions.  Just the truth.

(he looks at Harry)

Are you ready for that?

SWANN

Hey!

SWANN

Thought not.

HARRY

Dorothea?

SWANN

She's not here.

HARRY

Did she know where Nix was buried?

SWANN

No.

HARRY

Who else did?  Did Valentin?

SWANN

Yes.

HARRY

Jesus!

BUTTERFIELD

Like the look of these?  I made

them myself, to set him free.

DOROTHEA

Why did you wait so long?

BUTTERFIELD

I didn't have the skill to

resurrect him.  I had to teach

myself.  And that took time.

DOROTHEA

And you think he'll be in a fit

state to resurrect, after thirteen

years?

BUTTERFIELD

If he was just a man like me, then

no.  But he's not.

DOROTHEA

What is he?

BUTTERFIELD

Maybe he'll show you.

NORMAN

He will come!  He will come! He

will come!

BUTTERFIELD

Anything?

VALENTIN (V.0.)

Not yet.

BUTTERFIELD

If you've lied to me to me --

VALENTIN

I swear... this is the place Swann

told me about.  The rocks...

BUTTERFIELD

Five more minutes.  Hear me? And

you'd better not --

BUTTERFIELD

What the fuck are you playing at?

BUTTERFIELD

Aah!

VALENTIN (V.O.)

Butterfield!

VALENTIN

(blinded)

In the corner...

BUTTERFIELD

(to Valentin)

Keep away from it.

VALENTIN

Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

BUTTERFIELD

(reverentially)

It's him... it's him.

CUT TO:

HARRY

They got here before us.

SWANN

Looks that way.

HARRY

Shit!

HARRY

Swann?  Swann!

VALENTIN

D'Amour --

HARRY

Shit...

VALENTIN

Help me.

HARRY

Swann!

HARRY (V.O.)

Swann!

HARRY

Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

VALENTIM

He's got Dorothea.

SWANN

And Nix?

VALENTIN

Him too.

HARRY

We've got to get you to a hospital.

VALENTIN

Don't bother.

HARRY

Shut up.  We've lost enough lives

already.

VALENTIN

I'm sorry, D'Amour...

HARRY

What about?

VALENTIN

... Looks like you're going...

to lose... one more.

HARRY

(despairing)

... no...

SWANN

He's better off this way.

HARRY

(furious)

Nobody's better off this wav!

SWANN

You don't get it, do you? We're

shit. D'Amour.

SWANN

That's where we're all going.

HARRY

In my time, and nobody else's.

BUTTERFIELD

Do you wish him to be amongst us?

CULTISTS

Yes...

BUTTERFIELD

Will you come to him on your

knees?

CULTISTS

Yes...

BUTTERFIELD

Be ready.

DOROTHEA

Listen.  You've got everything you

want.  You don't need me. ..

BUTTERFIELD

No, but he will.  After what you

did to him.

BUTTERFIELD

He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS

that.

BUTTERFIELD

Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

CULTISTS

He's coming home... he/s coming

home...

DOROTHEA

Christ in Heaven.

BUTTERFIELD

He's with us...

CULTISTS

He's with us... He's with us...

DOROTHEA

Oh God!

BUTTERFIELD

Hold her!

NIX

(fury to agony)

Aaarrrgh!

CUT TO:

HARRY

(spooked)

Jesus... what the hell's going on

in there?

SWANN

At a guess... they just resurrected

him.

HARRY

Fuck.

NIX

Children...

NIX

Will you suffer to come unto me?

NIX

I've come back to share the wisdom

of the grave.  Will you hear it?

CULTISTS

Yes... yes...

NIX

Follow me then.

NIX

Do I know you, child?

NIX

Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun

this time, child?

(a beat)

Where's Swann?

DOROTHEA

I don't know where he is.

NIX

He'll come.  We've got unfinished

business, he and I.

NIX

(whispered to Dorothea)

Something terrible's going to

happen.  But if you hold on to me,

very tight, you may live a little

longer.

NIX

(to Cultists)

Are you ready for my wisdom?

CULTISTS

Tell us... tell us...

SWANN

(in terrified awe)

This is where we killed him.

HARRY

(looking at table)

You didn't try hard enough.

SWANN

I can't... I can't go any

further...

NIX

Here is my wisdom.

BARBARA

Show us. Puritan.

NORMAN

Yes, show us!

ALL

Show us!  Show us!

SWANN

(to Harry)

Whatever he's doing to her, stop

him!

NIX

(to unseen Cultists)

You see, I escaped the grave. So I

have to give something to the grave

in return.

NORMAN

What's happening?

NIX

I have to give something back. So

I'm giving you.

BARBARA

(sobbing)

Why?  Why?

NIX

You're not worthy.  None of you.

Only Swann was worthy. You just

waited like lambs.

NIX

Well I'm not your shepherd.

SWANN

Aah!

BUTTERFIELD

Go on, bleed.

(he slashes at Swann

again)

Go on!  Go on!

BUTTERFIELD

(screaming)

No!

NIX

You're not Swann.  Who are you?

(a beat) )

Oh... I know what you want. He lets

Dorothea slip from his arms.

DOROTHEA

Oh God!

HARRY

Hang on!

SWANN (V.O.)

Nix!

NIX

There you are.

NIX

I've had a lot of time to think

about you.  Where I went wrong...

SWANN

And?

NIX

I should have been honest with you,

right from the start.  I wasn't

born to show people the error of

their ways.  I was born to murder

the world.

NIX

You could still help me do that.

SWANN

Why would I want to?

NIX

Because you've got nothing else to

live for.

SWANN

Not true.

NIX

The woman has a new love in her

life.  Your friends are dead.

Nobody's left to save you, but me

HARRY

(to Dorothea)

I've got to help him.

DOROTHEA

You can't.

HARRY

Nix has got to have a weak spot.

Everybody's got a fucking weak

spot.

BUTTERFIELD

Bastard!

NIX

Will you help me?

SWANN

Yes.

NIX

You know I'll kill you when we're

done.  I have to.

SWANN

Yes.

NIX

But until then... it's you and

me... the way it always was.

SWANN

Yes.

NIX

Wait... you still feel something

for that bitch?

SWANN

No!

NIX

Liar!

NIX

Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

NIX

She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.

I'll show you!

SWANN

Harry!

SWANN (V.O.)

Harry!  Stop him!

NIX (V.O.)

Where is she?

NIX

Where did she go?

NIX

You've got Swann's disease. You

think a little courage, a little

love, and it'll all be all right.

Wrong!

HARRY

Oh God!

NIX

Tell me where she is... and I'll

make it go away...

HARRY

Oh God... oh God...

WOMAN

Help me.

HARRY

Dorothea!

HARRY

Dorothea!  Dorothea!

HARRY

No!  No!  No!

DOROTHEA (V.O.)

Harry...

DOROTHEA

It's not real, Harry-

DOROTHEA

Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's

good between us, believe it.

HARRY

... oh... God...

DOROTHEA

I'm here, Harry.

HARRY

...yes?

DOROTHEA

Yes.

NIX

(to Dorothea)

There you are, child.

DOROTHEA

Don't look.

HARRY

I... have... to.

NIX

Come on, child.  I want Swann to

see you die.

NIX

(to Harry)

What are you looking at?

HARRY

(points to his brow)

There... there!

DOROTHEA

Harry?

HARRY

I'm okay.  I'm okay.

NIX

One... last... illusion...

DOROTHEA

Oh my God.

SWANN (V.O.)

... D'Amour...

NIX

I am the purest of the pure.  I am

the darkest of the dark...

SWANN

Harry.  You can't kill him.

HARRY

(whispers)

He did something with the ground.

SWANN

Yes?

HARRY

Can you do it?

SWANN

I don't know.

HARRY

Try.

NIX (V.O.)

I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond

Hell.

HARRY

(to Dorothea)

Get out of here!

NIX

No!  No!  No!

DOROTHEA (V.O.)

Harry!

CUT TO:

DOROTHEA

Is it finished?

HARRY

I think so.

DOROTHEA

Come on...

HARRY

What the fuck?

DOROTHEA

Harry-?

HARRY

Out!  Out!

HARRY

(quietly)

It's finished.
