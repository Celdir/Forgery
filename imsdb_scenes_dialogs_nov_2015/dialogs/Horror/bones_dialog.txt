house of the Lord thy God, for they are

an abomination."  Deuteronomy.

dogs and prowling the city..." Psalms 59,

PALMER

Great.  Gun shots.

JASON

Just a backfire.

PALMER

Like you'd know.  Face it.  We're lost.

JASON

Take a left, no, I mean a right.  Okay,

stop for a second.

JASON (CONT'D)

We're here.  Where the hell are you?

STANK

(on phone)

Back here.  At the end of the block.

STANK (CONT'D)

(on phone)

You got the cash?

JASON

You got the shit?

STANK

(on the phone)

Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the

way on foot.  Leave your car and walk

over here.

JASON

Let me see it.

STANK

Let me see it.

JASON

(hands him the money)

Where is it?

STANK

I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And

I can't go get it for you cause you might

be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up

yourself.

STANK (CONT'D)

Don't worry.  It's just round the corner.

Halfway down that block, you can't miss

it.  Top step of the front stairs,

there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't

shitting you.

JASON

Fuck it.  Alright.

PALMER

Is it too late for me to officially

register my growing certainty that this

is an extremely bad idea?

JASON

Easy as pie.  And twice as tasty.

PALMER

Someone's screwing with the car!

SHOTGUN

Yo.  You two, get the hell away from

there!

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

Fools.

PALMER

Let's get the hell outta here.

JASON

Oh fuck, c'mon...

OLDER COP

...not going in there.  Waste o' time.

YOUNGER COP

I saw 'em go in.

FAT OLDER COP

Forget it!  No way they're in there.

Trust me.  I've been working down here

twenty years.  No one goes in there.

LUPOVICH

Let's get the hell outta here.

PALMER

Gimme some light.

PALMER (CONT'D)

Just a dog...

PALMER

Damn, bro.  That was close!

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

You still mad?  Still want me?  Come on

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

Oh, right.  You can't.  You're trapped

there.  Well ain't that too bad.  Ain't

that just too damn bad.

CLOSE ON:

MAURICE

Goodness gracious grande bolas del fuego!

PATRICK

Well, the bad news is we only made 25

bucks each.

TIA

How could that be?  The box was packed!

PATRICK

Moe's terms.

MAURICE

We practically paying him for the

privilege of playing his club.

BILL

So what the hell's the good news?

PATRICK

I just accelerated my top secret long

term plan for our world domination.

MAURICE

Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to

bring you this special news bulletin --

(human teletype sounds) "Aliens from

Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and

injected moly headcheese into his skull

filling his entire brain cavity with

cosmic slop..."

PATRICK

I was planning on waiting until I got the

place cleaned out, but -- like the man

says, carpe diem.

TIA

Illibent?  Who's club is that?

PATRICK

Ours!

BILL

What're ya talkin' about, OURS?

BILL

Looks like a damn graveyard round here.

PATRICK

I'm telling you, this neighborhood is

coming back.

MAURICE

Yeah.  But just where the hell has it

been?

BILL

Damn.  That is the ugliest building I

have ever seen.

PATRICK

Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something

about it just buzzes me.

MAURICE

That would be the after effects of that

Reticular inseminoid encounter you had.

PATRICK

Welcome to the Ill Zone.

TIA

Damn it's cold in here!

BILL

It's eighty degrees outside.  And it's

gotta be barely fifty in here.

MAURICE

And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.

PATRICK

Whattaya think?  Can you picture it?

Over there the bar, and in here -- the

dance floor.

BILL

Possible...maybe...could be.

PATRICK

I got a great deal on it.  They couldn't

give this place away.  Just dead meat

stanking up their books for twenty years.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

The last owner on the lease before the

bank was back in '79.  Some dude named

Jimmy Bones.  Empty ever since.

MAURICE

Jimmy Bones?

PATRICK

Yeah, you heard of him?

MAURICE

You haven't?

PATRICK

Not that I remember.

MAURICE

He was a local legend back in the '70's.

There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal:

"This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black

as night and hard as stone..."

PATRICK

I was born near here.  My dad's from

here.  He never mentioned it.

BILL

Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the

place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum

props, man.  Platinum.

MAURICE

Yeah, in the land of the blind the one

eye'd are king.

BILL

What's your problem with Crippled Dick?

MAURICE

Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw,

it'd have to work to be a dump.

PATRICK

You gotta use your imagination.

MAURICE

"This is Patrick..."

(makes the sound of egg

cracking, the sizzling as it

lands in the skillet)

"...And this is Patrick on crack."

Imagination, my butt.  Even the space

cowboy can't...

PATRICK

(interrupting)

Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm

going downstairs and see if I can get the

furnace fired up.  Warm this place up,

you'll see.  It has serious potential.

MAURICE

Potential toxic dump site.

INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

BILL

Are you nuts?

MAURICE

The man said just to use my imagination.

(takes a huge hit)

Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential.

I can see it now.  The first major urban

theme park.  Village Ghetto land.

Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely

from broken glass, hypodermic needles and

crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.

BILL

Keep smokin', fool.

HOLLOW ECHOES

It ain't eh money.  It's the big fat

floating what if...

BILL

What did you say?

MAURICE

I didn't say nothing.

HOLLOW ECHOES

Take him down to the storm clear.  Bury

him.

BILL

You didn't hear that?  "Take him... "

Something.  "Bury him" or...

MAURICE

Take who where?  What you smokin'?

PATRICK

Go on old pipes, groan all you like.

Just please don't burst.  That I can't

afford.

HOLLOW ECHOES

Go on.  It won't kill you.

BILL

You had to hear tha...

HOLLOW ECHOES

I ain't gonna be the only one with this

nigger's blood on my hands...

BILL

What the f--?

MAURICE

'S up?

BILL

Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be

buggin' from hanging with you.

TIA

How'd you get locked in here?  And for

how long?  Poor baby...

TIA (CONT'D)

Poor boy.  You must be starving.

BILL

You want us to move in here?

PATRICK

That's the only way we'll get the place

fixed up in time.

MAURICE

Yeah right, and which ever of us is still

alive at the end of the week inherits all

Vincent Price's cash.

PATRICK

Look, you guys want to play college

radio, high school reunions, and some

fool's club once a week for the rest of

your lives, that's cool.  But I think we

can do better.

BILL

You soundin' like the old man now.

PATRICK

I believe in you guys.  You are the real

shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting

everything I got into this cuz I think we

can make it happen, but you gotta put a

little in too.  Now all I"m asking is

that everybody do their part.  We'll move

some shit in, and take shifts, or all

crash together here --

BILL

Pat's right.  It'll be fun.

MAURICE

Yeah, fine.  But Mars Needs Women.  If I

gotta sleep in a spookhouse, surround me

with chicks who are more scared than me.

Speaking of which...

BILL

(rips Maurice's skull)

Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And

don't forget it.

PATRICK

Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what

we need, then crash here.

TIA

Look who I found.

MAURICE

Damn, that's the nastiest dog I ever

seen.  Nothin' but skin and bones.

TIA

Yeah, call his skinny ass "Bones."

SHOTGUN

Hey, watcha doing with that dog?

BILL

He yours, sir?

SHOTGUN

Hell no!

BILL

Then what do you care?

SHOTGUN

Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or

let me.

BILL

Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.

PEARL

Don't feed that dog.

BILL

You people really don't like dogs.

PEARL

Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers

can't be satisfied.

MAURICE

(way under his breath)

And some people need their medication

tweaked.

PEARL

I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it.

It'll only make it hungrier.

MAURICE

Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?

PEARL

No thanks.

PATRICK

no really, let us help.  We're new in the

neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.

CINNABAR

You moved into this block?

MAURICE

Not really to live, just to play.

PEARL

That building?

MAURICE

Gonna be le hot shit.

(to Pearl)

Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The

Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard

of them?

PEARL

Should I?

CINNABAR

Are they on the radio?

PATRICK

Naw.  But they will be.  They're the

best.

CINNABAR

How do you know?

PATRICK

I manage them.

PEARL

And you bought the building?

PEARL (CONT'D)

You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure

you're not from around here?

PATRICK

I was born near here.  But after my

mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out

in Rossmore Park.

PEARL

You're pretty black to be growing up in

Rossmore Park.

EXT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - DAY

CINNABAR

Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for

the help.

PATRICK

Anytime.  Be seeing you.

MAURICE

Yeah, well if she got psychic powers, how

come she's working here on Desolation

Row?

EXT. BLACK CAT POOL CLUB - DAY

STANK

Say Eddie.

MACK

Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --

STANK

We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new

BMW.

MACK

That you stole off those white boys was

down here last night?  Are you crazy?

Everybody from hell to breakfast heard

that screamin' on Blackstone last night!

STANK

But --

MACK

How many times I told you, no psycho

shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm

the one that does it.

WEAZE

We didn't do nothing, Eddie.

MACK

You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those

punks and steal their ride?

WEAZE

That's all we did, steal their ride.

MACK

Get that car the hell away from here,

now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the

cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit

that pisses everybody off.

STANK

We just thought...

MACK

No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I

will burn your asses and snort the ashes.

Hear me?

GUARD

Okay, go on ahead.

BILL

I been living here my whole life, and

that hillbilly still has to check me out

each time.

MAURICE

Hey, it's his job.  Keeping indesirables

outta the hood.

PATRICK

Hey, Dad.

JEREMIAH

Not only do I have to feed the three

mouths I got, and that bottomless pit

they call Maurice, I gotta feed this

stray, too?

TIA

Shhh, Bones.  It's not nice to bite the

hand that feeds you.

JEREMIAH

What did you call that dog?

NANCY

(moving on)

Just what are you feeding him?  I didn't

know we had dog food.

TIA

We don't.  I used that meat you had in

the bowl.

NANCY

Tia, that was the prime rib I was

marinating for dinner.

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE BLOCK - TIME CUT

BONES

Hold up S-G.  Give him a toot.

JEREMIAH

'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.

(to his son)

Get back on the curb!  Now!

BONES

Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when

we was his age...

JEREMIAH

It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie

Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa

Korruptsky, too.

BONES

They get about twelve and a half minutes.

Tops.

JEREMIAH

Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind

this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big

business big.  Big corporation big.  Big

government big.  Our little acre alone'll

net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but

net.

BONES

Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a

muthafucking air ball.

JEREMIAH

One simple word, three little letters.

Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we

could move out of this dump, get the real

deal.  Big houses, legit business...

BONES

That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I

don't want to leave this street.  Ever.

The status quo is totally cool with me.

PEARL

Maybe I oughtta get there a little early.

For good luck.

BONES

Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just

letting 'em have their say before I say

no.

PEARL

(worried)

Let me see your hand.

BONES

All that shinin' and "reader and adviser"

mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't

know about the readin' but you both can

sure 'nuff advise.

PEARL

(swats his hand)

My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a

long line of mamas before her.

BONES

Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.

PEARL

Such fine hands.  You shoulda been a

musician.  You got the fingers.

PEARL (CONT'D)

Left hand's the past.  Your right's the

present.  And the future.  But it's not

written in stone.  It's written in flesh

and blood.  And flesh and blood will

change.  See?  There's something here, a

new line, right across your life line.

BONES

Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout

my phone line?

PEARL

No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that

meeting.  I got more fruit that needs

checking.  Come home with me now.

BONES

Don't you worry about a thing.  This

hand's gonna be stroking the back of your

neck tonight.

JEREMIAH

(under his breath)

'Cause you got all the status.  And I got

nothing but quo...

LUPOVICH

(to the cop in the car)

Wait here.  And don't touch my fucking

sandwich.

LUPOVICH

Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing

off your customers?

MACK

I ain't killed nobody.

(gives a menacing glance to

Stank and Weaze)

Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?

LUPOVICH

No time for eightball.  I got your tip.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

Confiscated their whole stash.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a

little bonus is due for knocking out the

competition.

MACK

You was just doing your job.

LUPOVICH

Last thing you need's for me to start

doing my fucking job.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

That's more like it.  Cost of doing

business.  Maybe you can deduct it on

your taxes.

INT. JEREMIAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

PATRICK

When we got a line of hundred paying

guests and another couple hundred inside

dancing, that's when I'll tell him.  And

I can't wait to see the look on his face.

INT. THE PEET DINING ROOM - LATER

PATRICK

And how do you think crack got into the

ghetto?  By magic?  Who flew it in?  Like

the man said "we don't own that many

planes."

JEREMIAH

Don't poison your mind with that ghetto

paranoia.  That's all just ways of people

justifying their own failure.

BILL

Dad, the man has been lying to us for a

hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty

acres and a mule?

JEREMIAH

You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in

the ass.

And personally, I don't need a mule.  I

got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --

TV ANCHOR

(on TV)

There's a lead tonight in the strange

disappearance of those two State College

fraternity brothers.  There car, a 1999

BMW, was found abandoned this afternoon

in an inner-city neighborhood.

JEREMIAH

What the hell do you want?

LUPOVICH

Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.

JEREMIAH

Don't call me that.

LUPOVICH

You certainly traded up.

(picks up a wedding picture

nearby)

...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.

JEREMIAH

Keep your hands to yourself, willya?

LUPOVICH

I been watching you.  You done good.

Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman

now.  Just like you always wanted.

JEREMIAH

And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much

fatter one.

LUPOVICH

No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've

stayed in the organization.  But then

again I never got the percentage you did.

JEREMIAH

Or you didn't know what to do with it.

LUPOVICH

Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why

I came to see you.  You sold the

building.

JEREMIAH

What building?

LUPOVICH

Don't shit a shitter.  Our building.

What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We

had an agreement.  You were supposed to

sit on it.  Not sell it --

JEREMIAH

I didn't sell it.

LUPOVICH

Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I

heard.

JEREMIAH

Claire?  Could you come in here.

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

Did we sell any properties on...

Blackstone recently?

CLA

Matter of fact, we did.  5606.

JEREMIAH

To who?

CLA

I only met with the broker.  The

structure was listed almost worthless and

had never even had a bid, I thought you'd

be pleased to see it sold to someone who

wants to improve the neighborhood.

Anything wrong?

JEREMIAH

No, of course not.  Good work.  Thanks a

lot.

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

You're right.  One of my associates sold

the building last month.

LUPOVICH

That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.

JEREMIAH

Look, even if anyone found anything

there, it's twenty years ago.  They could

never connect it to us.

LUPOVICH

You better hope not.  Cause it's like

they say, four can keep a secret, if

three are dead.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

Nice rack.  How old is --

JEREMIAH

That's it.  Get out.  Now!

BILL

Hey, that's...

JEREMIAH

That's what?

BILL

That's some terrible shit.

JEREMIAH

Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys

had no business messing down there.  Go

places you're not meant to be -- that's

what you get.

BILL

But that's your old hood, Pops.

JEREMIAH

Yeah, and it took some doing to get out

of there.  Just be glad I did and you can

start life from here instead of down

there.

PATRICK

But maybe we're the ones who should be

down there.  Doing something.  Making it

better.

JEREMIAH

Can't be done.  That place already died

and gone to hell.

SERIES OF ANGLES - A MONTAGE

PATRICK

Careful.  That's bad luck.

CINNABAR

That place is already bad luck.

PATRICK

Why?

CINNABAR

No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma

says.

PATRICK

What else does she say?

CINNABAR

Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And

she is a lot of things, not all of them

nice, but crazy Momma's not.

PATRICK

Way I figure, everything our parents tell

us is part true and part total B.S.  And

our whole job is figuring out for

ourselves which is which.

CINNABAR

My momma says every house is two houses.

Every street, two streets.  There's a

whole city, a whole world, kinda beside,

on top, just below this one.  The city of

the dead.

PATRICK

Like right now, there's actually like

hordes of dead people shambling around

us?  Fingers rotting off?

CINNABAR

Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a

fabric that kinda keeps things separate.

PATRICK

Lucky thing.

CINNABAR

Yeah.  But when something bad happens,

something really bad -- the wall breaks.

The fabric tears.

PATRICK

The dead get out?

CINNABAR

Or the living fall in.  Who knows.

PATRICK

And you believe her?

CINNABAR

If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty

yards of your door.

MAURICE

You ever hear of Jimmy Bones, sir?

SHOTGUN

What business is it of yours?

MAURICE

Just wondered.  We heard he used to live

in our building.

BILL

Is it true?

SHOTGUN

Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there,

too.

BILL

Died there?  How?

SHOTGUN

How the hell should I know?

MAURICE

What was he like?

SHOTGUN

Bones?  He was something.  He could be

cold as ice or warm as blood.  But he

never turned his back for a brother.

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

Always there.

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

Hey, kid.

BILL

Yeah?

SHOTGUN

Take my advice.  Get the hell out of

there.  It's a bad place.  Always has

been.

OLD WOMAN

...and every Tuesday, he'd roll by in his

car and drive me with all my laundry to

the laundromat so I wouldn't have to

carry the clothes.

WHEELCHAIR MAN

Jimmy Bones?  Yeah, I knew that

motherfucker.  People make out like he

was some kinda damn Robin Hood.

Bullshit.  I saw him cut some muhfucker's

tongue once with that razor of

his...dropped it right into that jar of

dill pickles they used to have on the

counter in the bar.

WINO

When I was a kid he used to slip twenties

into my pocket so I could buy toys and

shit.

(now to Maurice/at camera)

Bones was awrright.  He was solid.  And

then one day, he just wasn't around no

more.  Don't pay to ask too many

questions 'round here.

BILL

Tia?  Patrick?  That you?

BILL (CONT'D)

Shit.

PATRICK

Spooked?

BILL

No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.

PATRICK

Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.

BILL

Where's the others?

PATRICK

Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

PATRICK

...we just been in the damn suburbs too

long.

TIA

There wasn't any draft.  That window was

PATRICK

We're all tired.  Everybody makes

mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight,

everything's gonna look different.

PATRICK

I thought you were bringing the Colonel?

MAURICE

The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried

chicken.

PATRICK

Why not?  He eats everything else.

MAURICE

Just what army do you think the Colonel

was in?

(whistles Dixie)

Everybody knows the whole chicken

distribution network is owned by the

Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling

you.  There's something in the batter.

Say it makes a black man sterile.

BILL AND TIA

Bull.  Shit.

MAURICE

Word.  I saw it on Sixty Minutes.

PATRICK

Maurice, even if it was true, what are

you worried about?  Last time I checked,

you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the

hell you are.  But I know you aren't a

black man.

MAURICE

I am the future.  I am all colors.  All

races.  All creeds.  I am the melting

pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post

racial.

PATRICK

Post-toasted's more like it.

PEARL

Aren't you going to join us?

CINNABAR

I have to finish this for class.

PEARL

You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got.

Just like my momma had.  And the good

Lord didn't give you that vision just for

painting pretty pictures.  That's just

wasted time.

CINNABAR

You mean as opposed to your life?

CINNABAR (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.

PEARL

I don't want you meeting around that

house.  You stay away from those kids.

And away from that dog.

CINNABAR

They seemed alright.  Bring a little life

to that old building.

PEARL

Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked

in there.

CINNABAR

Have you ever been inside?

PEARL

Maybe once upon a time.  But that was

long ago.  Back before... before it

became what it is.

CINNABAR

And what's that?

Just a bad place.  And the doorway to

worse.

EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

CINNABAR

Just thought I'd see if you needed any

help.

TIA

Good.  We do need help.  First you can

help us eat lunch.

TIA

Watcha looking at, poochie?

CINNABAR

I hate it when dogs do that.  Like

they're looking right out of the world.

TIME CUT TO:

PATRICK

Must be something seeping through.  From

the floor.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Do you feel that?

TIA

Yeah.  It's.  Throbbing.

BILL

Like a heartbeat.

MAURICE

"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat."

Listen to the Di Franco twins there.

Just the plumbing or something, fool.

PATRICK

Maybe there's a pipe underneath the

floor.  It leaked and stained.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

You got a better explanation

MAURICE

Sounds like we got the Invisible Scratch

Piklz hiding in our pipes.

PATRICK

I think these bring the water down from

the bathroom.  Into this...

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Check it out.  The same shit that was in

the carpet.  Told you it was from the

plumbing.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Damn, I knew these pipes were wacked.

TIA

What is that?

MAURICE

(stopping)

Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too

much.

BILL

Just some flies.

MAURICE

Some flies?  I think this qualifies as

way more than "some."

CINNABAR

What a smell.

MAURICE

Hey, what you expect?  Where there's

smoke there's fire.  And where there's

flies, there's shit.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space

that was so perfect for a recording

studio.

BILL

Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.

PATRICK

Yeah, well, Maurice is right.  It's gonna

take more work than I thought.  But we

can still do it.  We'll lay a real floor

in here.  Put damping on the walls.

Totally controlled sound.  Be perfect.

No one could hear shit up on the street.

MAURICE

Yeah, perfect.  Really excellent.  We can

make our first record where no one can

hear us scream.  Be afraid.

CINNABAR

Oh god...

BILL

Hello.  Who're you?

MAURICE

Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children

of all ages, I'd like you to meet...

Jimmy Bones.

BILL

What the hell you talking about?

MAURICE

(singing)

"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black

as night and hard as stones/Gold plated

deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his

switchblade loose, and a diamond on his

hand..." There's the switchblade and

there's the diamond.  Don't know where

the deuce is parked.

BILL

You think that's really him?

MAURICE

Damn.  It's so...fresh.

TIA

Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take

that.  Might be evidence.

PATRICK

Evidence of what?

TIA

Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself

in the chest, then buried himself too.

PATRICK

Get your damn dog, girl!

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do

something about you.

TIA

What we have to do is call the police.

MAURICE

Right.  Call the police.  We'll have no

problem getting our permits then.

TIA

We can't just leave it here.

PATRICK

Yeah, we can.  Least till after this

weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll

deal with it then.

BILL

Whatever, let's just get the hellout of

here.

PATRICK (O.S.)

Cinn?

CINNABAR

What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.

MAURICE

Oh fuck.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

(to the corpse)

Sorry, but you wont' be needing this.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Or this.

TIA

Picky mutt.

CINNABAR

She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In

this house.

PATRICK

Believe me, my old man'd rupture his

spleen if he knew we was down here.  All

he talks about is the medal he deserves

for building us a life as far from this

'hood as possible.

CINNABAR

He probably thinks he's saving you from

something.  I'm sure that's what my

mother thinks.

PATRICK

I'm sure I can make your mother like me.

But then do I gotta worry 'bout your

father?

CINNABAR

I don't know anything about my father.  I

never met him.  Momma won't talk about

him, either.

PEARL

We should begin with a hymn.

CINNABAR

I can't.  Not yet.

PATRICK

It's alright.  If you want to go home...

CINNABAR

No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I

can't.  I mean I'm not ready.

PATRICK

Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the

boys.

PEARL

The spirit world is all around us right

this minute.  And the departed are

pressing in around us.

CINNABAR

(half-asleep)

It's okay, just don't get funny on me.

It's warmer this way.

PEARL

Someone's with us.  Who's joined the

circle?

OLD MAN

Lordy...what's that smell?

OLD WOMAN

Look.  The flowers.

PEARL

Knock once for yes.  And twice for no.

Is there someone who wishes to send a

message?

PEARL (CONT'D)

A message for one of us in the circle?

PEARL (CONT'D)

Is it for miss Lillian?

PEARL (CONT'D)

Is it a message for Mr. Abernathy?

PEARL (CONT'D)

Is the message for me?

CINNABAR

(laughing low)

Cut it out.

CINNABAR (CONT'D)

No, no Patrick.  Stop.

CINNABAR (CONT'D)

Cut it out.

CINNABAR (CONT'D)

No, no Patrick.  Stop.

CINNABAR

Patrick!  Stop!!

PATRICK

What's wrong?

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Are you alright?

PEARL (O.S.)

Cinnabar!!!

PEARL (CONT'D)

Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm

coming!

BILL

Why don't you hang on and I'll see if

she's here.

PEARL

I know damn well she's there.

PEARL

You might as well just dig down six feet

of muddy earth and sleep in your own

grave than stay another night in that

house.

BILL

You sure got a way with women, bro.  What

happened up there?

PATRICK

Damned if I know.

TIA

Yes!  We're in business.

INT. JEREMIAH'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

JEREMIAH

Where are we going?  You know I hate

surprises.

PATRICK

A little business move I made.  On my

own.  I think you're gonna approve.

JEREMIAH

What are we doing down here?

PATRICK

Like you always said, Pop, look for the

undervalued.

PATRICK

I bet you didn't even know your bank

owned the place.  I did it through a

broker so you wouldn't know it was me.

I couldn't wait to see your face when I

fixed it up.

JEREMIAH

Is this some kind of sick joke?

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my

life to get out of this neighborhood for

you to move right back in!

PATRICK

I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying

to do what you did.  Take nothing and

make something out of it.

JEREMIAH

No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down.

Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back.

I'll take care of it.

PATRICK

You'll take care of it?  Not this time.

No way.  I bought it fair and square.

And we open tonight.

JEREMIAH

Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it

back!  That's an order!

Then he looks up and sees Shotgun in the window.  Feeling

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

You all are coming back to the house,

now!

CLUBBER

Man, I think we're lost.  You guys know

where Illibent is?

This portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not

BONES

Pull over.  I'll walk the rest.

BONES (CONT'D)

Naw, all wrong.  First, start at the

belly button.

BONES (CONT'D)

Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth.

If it's ragged, it was picked too soon.

Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to

have just a little give, here.

(his hands on her hips)

At the edges.  And last, but not very far

from least...

(now only a breath apart)

You gotta get your nose in it and give it

a gooooood, looooong sniff.

PEARL

I don't know whether to chill you and

serve with cottage cheese, or rip you

open and eat you right here.

BONES

Listen, Baby, I gotta TCB this evening.

So come over 'bout eight.  We should be

finished by then.

JEREMIAH

Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't

you?

BONES

We met.

MACK

Yeah, we used to do the after-school b

ball at Kenwood.  What it is?

BONES

What it will be.

JEREMIAH

And Officer Lupovich.

MACK

You got a nice crib here.

BONES

I do alright.  Everybody's happy.

MACK

But things change.  You gotta think

ahead.

LUPOVICH

They got lotteries all over now, Bonesy.

Coming here too, maybe next year.

JEREMIAH

Half our old customers are gonna be

getting their people to cross state lines

to pick up lotto tickets.

MACK

Besides, there's more money to be made in

the gin than the juice.  What do anybody

want with numbers anyway?

BONES

What else?  Money.

MACK

It ain't the money - it's the high.  The

big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way

more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So

you never have to pay out.

BONES

But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a

twenty-dollar bag.

MACK

Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm

talking about a five-dollar kick in the

head that's a quick ticket to heaven.

And the fools keep coming back for more.

BONES

Those 'fools' are my people.

MACK

Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po'

man's free base.  Here, check it out.

BONES

I ain't interested.  And if you gonna

sell it, don't sell it round here.

MACK

Just try it.

BONES

I said, no thanks.

MACK

Go on.  It won't kill you.

SHOTGUN

Back off, Huggybear...

MACK

It's like this, Jimmy.  There's a wave

coming.  A big ass Krakatoa, East of Java

wave.  And either you gonna be on top of

the wave up there in chocolate heaven, or

you gonna be buried 'neath the muddy

undertow.

BONES

That's cool.  Totally wide-screen sci-fi.

Forward thinking.  I respect that.  But

that ain't my life.  I'm here and now.

Comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night

in a warm nappy dugout.  I'm maintaining.

That's what it's about for me.  And your

twelve and a half-minutes is up.

MACK

Fine.  Let's go, Loopy-Lou.  Jimmy ain't

into it.  Gonna skip the money train and

take the bus.  His loss.

JEREMIAH

Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I

think you oughtta hear the deal.

BONES

I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't

need any partners.  I don't need new

product.  And I sure as hell don't need

this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.

MACK

Just try it, Jimmy.  That's all...

LUPOVICH

You heard the man.  Try it.

MACK

Ain't worth it, Blood.  Just drop it.

And kick it here.

LUPOVICH

Tell her to stop screaming.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

I said stop that bitch screaming or I'll

spread her like butter.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

Get his razor.  I ain't gonna be the only

one with this nigger's blood on my hands.

LUPOVICH (CONT'D)

Take the gloves off.  Everybody leaves a

print.  We hang out together.  Or we hang

separately.  Cut him.  And cut him good.

MACK

What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.

LUPOVICH

Now you.

JEREMIAH

No way man...

LUPOVICH

You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your

choice.

BONES

Jay bird...help me...like brothers.

JEREMIAH

Sorry, my brother.

BONES

Since we was just grasshoppers...

JEREMIAH

You always told me, it's a dog eat dog

world.

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

Just do it.  He won't even feel it.

LUPOVICH

Now you, girlie.

PEARL

I won't.

LUPOVICH

Same deal all around.  Or die with him.

PEARL

I can't.  I won't.  Go ahead.  Shoot me.

I'll be better off.

JEREMIAH

Too risky to take him outside.  Take him

down to the storm cellar and bury him.

And get rid of this too.

(tosses Pearl's bloody dress)

Let this whole damn building be his tomb.

BACK DOWN

PATRICK

Be cool.  Everybody's gonna get in.

PEARL

...I've seen things.  In there.  Last

night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you

didn't.  You were crying like a baby.

CINNABAR

You said the vision, the images.  They're

just that.  Just pictures.  They can't

hurt you.  That's what you always said.

PEARL

I lied.

CINNABAR

All the more reason I should be here.

PEARL

Please.  It's for your own good.

CINNABAR

You said bad things hurt places.  So

maybe good things heal them.  Good things

are happening here.  Maybe for the first

time ever.  And maybe that's all it

takes.

PEARL

I hope so, child.  I really hope so.

MAURICE

The gangsta of love is in the house.

ECHO (O.S.)

In the house...house...house...

MAURICE

Ill Bill is in the house...house...house

... house.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Jimmy Bones is in the house...house...

house...

This is the story of Jimmy Bones.  Black

as night and hard as stones.

BILL

...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad,

whupped his mamma, shot his dad.

MAURICE

Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill.

Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar

bills.

TIA

...Lord he never worked a day and he

never will...

MAURICE

Can you take a little extended solo right

about now, funk soul brotha?

BILL

Go for it.

MAURICE

Hey, baby.  Time for a little meat beat

manifesto.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Ahhh, tantric breathing.  I'm in love.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

That's it, honey.  Don't need to speak.

Jesuis le Gangsta de l'amour.  El Gaucho

della Cosmos.  We will speak zee

international language of love...

MAURICE (O.S.)

(voice in music mix)

"Jimmy Bones is in the house...house...

house."

BILL

Where's the gangsta of love?

PATRICK

Probably stoned out of his gourd in some

corner.

BILL

Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch

any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal

tunnel syndrome.

PATRICK

Yo.  Maurice.  Where are you?

DOG/MAURICE

The gangsta of love don't eat no fried

chicken...

SHOTGUN

Unh-unh.  Let it burn.

SHOTGUN (CONT'D)

We shoulda done this a long time ago.

PEARL

I don't know.

BONES

You won't be needing this.

INVESTIGATOR

Flying razor, big black man, spontaneous

explosion.  I got just one question: what

the hell narcotic were you all on?

PATRICK

We never did that.  Only...Maurice was

into it.

COP

That's the one you left behind?

BILL

Yeah.  My man Maurice.  The Space Cowboy.

The Gangsta of Love.

JEREMIAH

None of you say another word.

PEARL

It's alright, baby.

CINNABAR

Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.

PEARL

If he was trying to kill you, you'd be

dead.

CINNABAR

Who?  Who is he?  What is he?

PEARL

Your father.  He was your father.

INT. CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

JEREMIAH

I don't want any of you ever back down

there again.  You hear me?  And this time

you'll listen to me.  Or I'll let them

throw your asses in jail.  I mean it.

PEARL

You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I

didn't even know.  That night.  When they

- we - killed him, that you were already

alive inside me.  Life's like that.

Grows right out of death.

CINNABAR

But if it's him.  If he's really come

back, won't he know us?  Love us?

PEARL

Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't

that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long

time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and

all that's left is that ravening, hungry

spirit in the blood that soaked into the

house itself, I suppose.

CINNABAR

But how do you know?  Maybe he just

wanted to see us?  And now he's gone

again.  And you've all killed my father

for the second time.

BONES (O.S.)

Free at last, free at last.

SHOTGUN

It wasn't my fault.  I didn't know what

they'd planned.

BONES

Shush.  It don't matter now.

SHOTGUN

No.  Really, Jimmy.  Remember, man.  It's

me.  I was on your side.  Don't you

remember?

BONES

Take a look at what I remember,

brother...

SHOTGUN

I had no choice, Jimmy.  What else could

I do?

BONES

You coulda died with me.  Died trying.

BONES (CONT'D)

Feel better?

BONES (CONT'D)

You gonna be free and clear, Shotgun.

All debts paid...

BONES (CONT'D)

See you on the other side, brother.

PATRICK

Did you do it?

JEREMIAH

Sure, son.  I went down there and torched

the place myself.

PATRICK

You could have had it done.  You didn't

want us there.

JEREMIAH

I wouldn't have risked killing you to get

you out.  I was trying to protect you.

PATRICK

From what?

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Why?  Why did you give a shit about the

building?  Why did you care that we were

there of all places?

JEREMIAH

It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you

can see now.

PATRICK

Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For

once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came

from there, too.

JEREMIAH

You were just a kid.

PATRICK

I saw your face.  You knew that place.

You knew those people.

JEREMIAH

That's the past.  It's dead.

PATRICK

Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.

(points to the bandages)

It's alive.  And it bites.

STANK

Looking to score?

BONES

Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural

high.  A supernatural high.

STANK

Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on

his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other

bitch's block.

BONES

(sorta singing)

Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains

and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...

WEAZE

Yeah.  But he got a baaaad coat.  Whataya

say, bro?  I check out your coat?

BONES

Sure.  Here it is.

BONES (CONT'D)

Cut that shit out.

BONES (CONT'D)

You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be

seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.

STANK

Wh-wh-whooo?

BONES

Bones.

PEARL

(without looking up)

Welcome back, lover.

PEARL (CONT'D)

Not so bad.  You're not quite him.  But

you're not the shaggy demon I expected,

neither.

PEARL (CONT'D)

You look confused.  The dead often are.

'Course, so are the living.  Take me.  I

been confused a long time.  Least twenty

years.  Maybe if I hadn'ta walked in at

that moment.  Or maybe if I hadn'ta let

you go at all.  I figure one way or the

other, I killed you.  So it's only fair:

kill me, lover.  I don't mind.  I'll even

help you.  The way you helped me.

PEARL (CONT'D)

No?  That mean there's something more

left of you than just that hungry spirit?

What are you going to do now?  Kill us?

Kill us all?

BONES

No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.

PEARL

Forgive me?  The hell with you, Jimmy.

Cause I don't forgive you, I don't

forgive you for dying.  And for being so

goddamn stubborn.  Or for haunting my

dreams.  And I don't forgive you for

anything you're about to do.

MACK

You boys been hitting the pipe?

WEAZE

No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He

was tall, and thin, and like a shadow,

his face was just a blur.  All I remember

is the voice.  It was smooth and low and

it didn't seem to be comin' out of his

mouth.

MACK

Then how'd you hear it, fool?

WEAZE

It was just like in my head.

MACK

Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in

that head and let all them voices out.

You'll feel better, I promise.

STANK

No, Eddie, man.  Wait.

MACK

I told you not to lie to me.  Now what

the hell happened?

COKE WHORE

(needs a hit)

What about me, baby?

MACK

Shutup, bitch.  Now what, he just said to

tell you what?  He was back?  Who was

back?

STANK

Bones.

MACK

Bones?  What the fuck is that supposed to

mean?  Get the fuck out of here.  Both of

you, 'fore you hear my voice up in yo'

head.

PEARL

He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last

one of them.

CINNABAR

Who?

PEARL

Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And

even when he's done, who knows.  He won't

be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog.

Feed it, and it just grows hungrier.

Feed his hunger for revenge - he just

wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop.

That kind of hunger ain't never

satisfied.

CINNABAR

Aren't you gonna do something about it?

PEARL

Like what?  I got a little power, sure.

A touch of the shining, a little of the

sight.  But no more than you do.  We're

not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or

say a magic word and make him go away.

Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we

all do.

CINNABAR

I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his

brother and sister don't.  And they're in

the house with him.

PEARL

(long beat)

Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose.

'Cept you.

MACK

Bones, my ass.

(sings while unbuttoning the

manicurist's blouse)

"...if you don't believe he's laid to

rest/You count the holes in his

motherfucking chest..."

COKE WHORE

That tickles.  I want to hear that again.

MACK

That's it, baby.  Gimme the rolling bass

and I'll tickle your tweeter all night

long...

MACK

C'mon, baby!

MACK (CONT'D)

Bitch.  Nobody walks out on Eddie Mack.

MACK (CONT'D)

Muthafucka!

MACK (CONT'D)

C'mon.  I take you all on.

MACK (CONT'D)

What the...?

MACK (CONT'D)

Who's there?

MACK (CONT'D)

Bones?  Jimmy Bones?  That you?  You're

dead.  I killed you and I stuck your dead

ass in a hole in the ground wrapped in

nothing but your bitch's bloody rags.

Now I'll count the holes in your

muthafuckin' chest.  And I'll add a few

more.

BONES

This it?  Your big-ass tidal wave.

BONES (CONT'D)

Look like the wave's long gone and

nothing but oil scum, dead fish, and yo'

ugly ass left on the beach.

BONES (CONT'D)

(Mack's voice)

"I'm taking a five dollar kick in the

head that's a quick ticket to heaven."

LUPOVICH

I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.

(hangs up)

Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped

today?  He's got something for us.  I

knew he would once he thought about it.

SAL

Shit, that was fast.

LUPOVICH

12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway,

he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with

me.

SAL

I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it

yourself?

LUPOVICH

Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by

myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.

SAL

Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD (O.S.)

(as if swinging back and forth)

Bones!  Bones, you muthafuckah!  What the

hell you done to me?

BONES

Not half what I'm planning on...

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD

This some sick fucked up shit.  What you

want with my head?

BONES

Just using it to carry your soul.

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD

My soul?  Fuck you.  Look, I killed you.

You killed me.  Fine.  Now...

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD (CONT'D)

...we're even.  No need to get all meta

fucking-phys-i-gack...

LUPOVICH

Shit!  Fuck!

BONES

(in Mack's voice)

"Just try it...go ahead...it won't kill

you."

BONES (CONT'D)

(in Lupovich's voice)

"I ain't gonna be the only one with this

nigger's blood on my hands..."

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD

Was that really necessary?  Can you wipe

my fucking face?  I can't see a goddamned

thing.

PEARL

We'll have to sneak in.

CINNABAR

No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them

call and tell Patrick it's us.

PEARL

Girl, they build gates like that to keep

people like us out.

GUARD

(on phone)

A young lady to see you.  A Miss

Vaughn...

JEREMIAH

No.  Sorry.  Send her away.

GUARD

Sorry Miss.

CINNABAR

Can't I call?  And talk to them.

GUARD

Sure.  But not from here.  Nearest public

phone would be back a few miles.  Outside

the mall.

PEARL

Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's

go home.

CINNABAR

Mother!  No.

PATRICK

Cinnabar?  Walk around the north side.

There's an opening there.

GUARD

Can I help y--

MACK'S SEVERED HEAD

Can Jeremiah come out and play?

CINNABAR

Why couldn't you just tell him to let us

in?

PATRICK

My old man calls the shots.  He built

that gate and these damn walls.

PEARL

(to Cinnabar)

You sure we oughta save him?  Why not

just let see how safe his gates and walls

keep him when his past comes calling?

PATRICK

Save him?  What are you talking about?

BONES (O.S.)

Hey, brotha!  What it is?

BONES (CONT'D)

What it will be.

JEREMIAH

How did you get in here?

BONES

Time like this, is that what you really

want to know?  How I got the fuck in

here?

PATRICK

Where's Dad?

NANCY

His study.  Who're your friends?

PATRICK

Dad?  Open up.  Dad??

PATRICK (CONT'D)

C'mon.  We got to get in there.

BILL

We can't go back there.  Are you crazy?

You saw --

PEARL

It's the only way.  It's possible your

father may not be dead yet.

PEARL (CONT'D)

Your father was his best friend.  He

loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the

most of all now.  He'll take his time.

But even if it is too late.  If your

father is dead.  It's not over.  The door

has to be closed.

BILL

Well, close the fucking door by all

means.  But don't expect me to go down

there and do it.

PEARL

I don't.

PATRICK

You ain't going down there.  Not alone.

I'll go.

BILL

Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of

friends.

PEARL

They won't do you no good.

NANCY

What are you doing?  I've just called the

police and 911.

PATRICK

Then we need to get out of here.  We

can't try to explain this to them.  We'll

be back.  Hopefully with Dad.

BONES

You two bitches were just meat, never had

any idea smarter than getting yourself a

little more.  But my brother Jaybird,

here.  He was smart.  He didn't just want

more.  He wanted more with compound

interest.

BONES (CONT'D)

Time for him to collect his interest.

Jeremiah's gonna have the unique

experience of seeing his reward, tasting

it while he's still alive.

PEARL

... see there ain't just two parts to a

person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and

Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood.

It's the wanting that holds body and soul

together, and sometimes, the wanting

lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in

the house.

PATRICK

But the place burned to the ground.

PEARL

The blood is still there.  We just gotta

figure out where.

CINNABAR

In his grave there was a cloth or a dress

or something.  Covered with blood.

PEARL

My God.  My dress.  We have to find it.

And burn it.  And shut the door.

INT. BONES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

BONES

(keeping Jeremiah out from

hands' reach)

I don't understand it.  You were my Man.

Since we was grasshoppas.  I always

looked after you.  You had a piece of

everything I had.

JEREMIAH

I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted

my own.

BONES

And the hell everybody else, right?

JEREMIAH

Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda

done the same thing if you was me.

BONES

No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a

man - any man.  Let alone a brother like

that.  Course, as you can see, no good

deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is,

if the good get fucked, what we got saved

up for the bad?  You about to find out.

BONES

It's a trip, ain't it?

PEARL

We've got to hurry.  We've got to shut

the door.  They're getting out.

PATRICK

There was a storm door, to the cellar.

JEREMIAH

What will it take?  What do you want?

Just tell me, Jimmy!

BONES

Aw that's easy.  I want my life back.

Can you swing that, my brother?

JEREMIAH

You know I can't.

BONES

Then fuck it!!!

BONES (CONT'D)

(sadly)

Dog eat dog, brother.  Dog eat dog.

BILL

Here!

PATRICK

It's not safe down there.  The fire

started down there.  The whole thing

could collapse.

PEARL

Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy

Bones is gonna be around a long time.

PATRICK

Here.

PEARL

Is it there?

PEARL (CONT'D)

It's gone.  He got it.

BILL

NO!!!!!!

PEARL

It's alright.  Let me.

CINNABAR

Mama!!!!!

BONES (O.S.)

Hey, baby.

PEARL

(still with her back to him)

Jimmy, you've got --

BONES

I've got what I want.  Turn around baby,

look at me.  Look at your man.

BONES (CONT'D)

I want you to do something for me, baby.

PEARL

What?

BONES

I always loved you in this dress.

PATRICK

We can climb out.

BILL

Climb out to where?

PATRICK

Anywhere but here.

PEARL

Where are we, baby?

BONES

Where we'll always be...

PEARL

But.

BONES

Hush, baby.

PATRICK

Is this Hell?

BILL

(gripping the gun)

Or just Hell-adjacent...

CINNABAR

Ain't no Heaven.  Ain't no Hell.  There's

just the world of the dead, my momma

always talked about.  Like she said, the

door is open, and we're seeing right

through our world into this one.  We just

have to remember what was really here.

And follow it.  Those stairs should take

us to the second floor.

BONES

Just like I told you this morning, I'd be

stroking your neck tonight.

PATRICK

Shit.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Thing worked fine a minute ago.

Batteries were brand new --

BILL

Maurice!

CINNABAR

That's not Maurice --

PATRICK

Maurice.  Hold up, man.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

(as he shakes the flashlight)

Okay, we're on the second floor.  I feel

it.  No more steps.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Bill?!  Cinnabar?  Cinnabar?!

CINNABAR

I'm here.

PATRICK

Bill!  Bill?!

CINNABAR

Patrick, he's...

PATRICK

Okay, okay.  Listen:

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right

near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk

up there.

CINNABAR

I can't find you.

PATRICK

Here!

CINNABAR

Is that you?

PATRICK

Yeah.  Come on.  Don't let go.

JEREMIAH

Paaatrick...

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

(as if a million miles away)

Patrick.  Help me.

BONES

Welcome home, baby girl.

JEREMIAH

Please...help me...

PATRICK

Dad?

JEREMIAH

Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help

me...

PATRICK

Daddy?

JEREMIAH

Please.  Help me.  I'm scared.

JEREMIAH (CONT'D)

It hurts.  I don't want to spend forever

like this.

PATRICK

No!!!

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Cinnabar!  Stop!

PATRICK (CONT'D)

No!  Cinnabar, no!!!!

PEARL

Noooooo!

BONES

NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

PEARL

(to Patrick and Cinnabar)

Get out!!!  Go!!!

PATRICK

We gotta jump!

CINNABAR

I can't!

PATRICK

We have to!

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Cinnabar!  Where are you!?

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Cinn!  Jump!!

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Let's go!!!

PATRICK

We made it...

BONES (O.S.)

Dog eat dog, boy.  Dog eat dog...

FADE TO BLACK.
