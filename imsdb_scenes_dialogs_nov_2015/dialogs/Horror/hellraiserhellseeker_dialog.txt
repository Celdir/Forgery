KIRSTY

Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two

hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR

Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now

Kirsty?

KIRSTY

Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

TREVOR

Five hundred ninety two thousand seven

hundred and four.

KIRSTY

Uh... eighty two?

TREVOR

Eighty four.

KIRSTY

You win! Okay pull over.

TREVOR

(looking at his watch)

But... I thought...

KIRSTY

(laughing)

If what I've heard is true this could be

the last time for a long long time.

Besides we've got a whole seven minutes

before the next one. Clock's ticking.

Tick-tock...

KIRSTY

(through clenched teeth)

PULL OVER NOW.

(CONTINUED)

2.

KIRSTY'S VOICE

(from BELOW FRAME)

Honey what's wrong?

TREVOR

What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this

anyway?

KIRSTY

(self-conscious)

I'm... I'm doing a very special thing

here. And you can't even ... respond?

TREVOR

Sorry honey the present situation isn't

exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't

we be getting to the hospital?

KIRSTY

I was going to keep breathing you know.

You think I'm an amateur or something?

TREVOR

Just concentrate on the task at hand

please. Listen to me. You should be

giving ME this lecture.

KIRSTY

You've been cheating on me haven't you?

TREVOR

Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor

during your last contraction.

KIRSTY

Roughly two thirds of married men who

cheat start during the eighth month of

their wives' first pregnancy.

(CONTINUED)

3.

TREVOR

I would never cheat on you. Not while

you're pregnant now you know that.

KIRSTY

(features tightening)

Okay... uh oh here comes another one.

TREVOR

Share the pain Kirsty.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

One fifteen.

KIRSTY

(in dire pain)

Oh God...... Trevor, I think my water

just broke.

KIRSTY (CONT'D)

Oh my God. It's coming out.

TREVOR

What?

KIRSTY

THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT!

SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!

TREVOR

Okay Kirsty don't panic. Just keep

breathing! DON'T PANIC! Put the seat back

and hold on to something. Were almost

there!

(CONTINUED)

4.

KIRSTY

OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! (breathing

heavily) oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor,

It's coming out.

TREVOR

This isn't happening.

TREVOR

Honey, take it easy.    Your gonna be

alright.

TREVOR (cont'd)

Kristy! Take it easy. everythings gonna

be alright. Com'on, start the breathing,

with me... come on. One, two-three, and

blow..

TREVOR (cont'd)

Krist.   Honey. Kristy!

(CONTINUED)

5.

TREVOR (cont'd)

Kristy! Honey wake up!

TREVOR (cont'd)

Honey, wake up. Please wake up.

(CONTINUED)

6.

TREVOR

Kristy!

Kristy!

TREVOR (cont'd)

Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy.

(frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy.

TREVOR

Where is she...? Where's Kirsty?

TREVOR

Hey, what are you-

(CONTINUED)

7.

TREVOR

What are you people doing?!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

What's happening to-!

CHIEF SURGEON

As you can see I just accessed the speech

center, temporarily shutting down all

verbal ability.

CHIEF SURGEON (CONT'D)

The goal is find the exact point in the

brain where moral decisions are made, the

place where right and wrong is

distinguished. In exploring this Morality

Center I will most likely be triggering

memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our

patient may experience some distress

during the proceedings but they are not

due to pain. It is merely our patient-

recalling his past...

CHIEF SURGEON (cont'd)

As he was thrown into the lake, where the

beast and the false prophet had been

thrown.

(CONTINUED)

8.

CHIEF SURGEON (cont'd)

Where you will be tormented day and night

for ever and ever. (rev.20:10)

ANGELIC WOMAN

Well? What do say Trevor? Que pasa?

TREVOR

Where do I start?

ANGELIC WOMAN

How's the old noggin? Any change in the

intensity?

ANGELIC WOMAN (cont'd)

Can you describe the pains?

TREVOR

I'm not sure. How about a jackhammer in

the Occipital lobe?

(CONTINUED)

9.

TREVOR

Are you a dream too?

ALLISON

Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...

TREVOR

What just happened to me anyway? It

looked like a dream but it felt like

reality.

ALLISON

It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so

much of it, you could be asleep and

dreaming even with your eyes wide open.

TREVOR

Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?

ALLISON

(confused)

Your wife...?

ALLISON

(to Ambrose)

Still a little hazy. He's still in pain

too, even after the morphine. I recommend

we admit him. At least for another day...

(leaning in, sotto)

He just asked for his wife...

AMBROSE

Well I can't find any abnormalities. I

think we're ready for discharge.

ALLISON

But, Dr. Ambrose-

AMBROSE

(looking up at Trevor)

I think it's time to ween you off these

painkillers too. Wouldn't want you to

develop a dependency to them. You might

do things like come to the hospital for

no reason other than to get a fix,

wouldn't you?

(CONTINUED)

10.

ALLISON

Well looks like you're going home! Hope

you brought your bus pass.

TREVOR

Do you kids mind keeping it down?

OLD WOMAN

Aww let them be. They're only kids.

DEMONIC VOICE FROM TV

YOU LOSE...

11.

BRET

Trevor what is the metric probability of

you getting any work done at all today?

TREVOR

Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a

split coconut.

BRET

Dude there is a track on the carpet

between here and the bathroom. It was

made by your ass. You've been dragging it

all fucking week.

What happened to you yesterday?

BRET (cont'd)

You never came back after lunch. Did you

get a piece o'ass, you bastard?

(CONTINUED)

12.

TREVOR

Give me a break. I checked back into the

hospital- amongst other things.

BRET

Hospital? You haven't been to the

hospital since uh...

TREVOR

Since what?

BRET

(getting uncomfortable)

Look never mind. Just get some numbers

going- any numbers at all will due. The

hills have eyes remember?

BRET (CONT'D)

I'm just looking out for ya.

BRET

Sixty five point three percent of all

headaches are due to low sugar levels in

the bloodstream Trevor.

(CONTINUED)

13.

PINHEAD

It's too late.

WOMAN

SNAP OUT OF IT!

GWEN

Jesus what the hell was that? It's like

you saw a ghost or something.

GWEN (CONT'D)

(angrily)

Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to

run a business here. I can't have people

flipping out in the break room when they

should be slaving away at their desks.

TREVOR

Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a

second there.

(CONTINUED)

14.

GWEN

Well don't let it happen again. Or I may

have to spank you.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Get back here, junior bean counter. This

is your supervisor speaking.

TREVOR

Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.

GWEN

How do you think you got this job, cock?

(cozying up to him)

Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our

little midnight swim.

GWEN (CONT'D)

What's wrong, Trev?

TREVOR

Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-

GWEN

And it shows. Least it did last night at

the quarry. In a big way.

TREVOR

Please you're going way too fast for me

here.

GWEN

YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr.

Mario Andretti himself?

TREVOR

Gwen, my wife's dead.

GWEN

Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize

it must be hard. But Christ how long does

it take someone to move on?

(CONTINUED)

15.

TREVOR

That was cold...

GWEN

No, making another woman compete with

someone who's been dead eight months.

That's cold.

GWEN (cont'd)

Yeah, Trevor thats it. Thats it.

TREVOR

I'm sorry Gwen. I don't know what's

happening to me. (zipping up) I think

it's the painkillers, really.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

They mess with my head. Yesterday gets

blacked out and a memory from months ago

is played out in vivid technicolor. Like

the accident just happened you know?

GWEN

Why don't you let me take you out

tonight? I promise to make it the most

memorable night of your life.

(CONTINUED)

16.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Pick you up round seven. And Gooding? Get

some fucking work done.

TREVOR

(into phone)

You got Trevor.

MAN'S VOICE

(from phone)

Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from

homicide. It's about your wife.

LANGE

(to Trevor)

Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has

your head healed okay by now?

TREVOR

Where's my wife?

LANGE

Okay then. Here's the scoop.

(CONTINUED)

17.

LANGE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

We still haven't been able to locate your

the body in that river. And missing

persons turned up some evidence that

qualified the disappearance as foul play.

TREVOR

What evidence?

LANGE

For one thing there were no skid marks on

that bridge, the tires were all intact,

from what we could tell, nothing wrong

internally with the vehicle either. Like

the car had been driven off the bridge

intentionally.

TREVOR

It should all in the report. I told you

guys everything. She was giving birth in

the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel

and I lost control.

LANGE

I did read that, yes. (flipping through

the report) What hospital were you going

to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge

isn't exactly on the way to Mercy

General.

LANGE (CON'T) (cont'd)

Listen we really are at a stalemate here

until we find the body itself. Is there

any way you did not tell missing persons

everything that happened just before that

accident?

TREVOR

Why wouldn't I tell you everything?

(impatiently) Look, I've been fully

cooperative...

(quick to add)

... to my recollection.

(CONTINUED)

18.

LANGE

I'm sorry Mr. Gooding, I meant no

disrespect. I'm just doing my job here,

OK? I mean between your head injury and

the fact that you are on very strong pain

medication, you might not be remembering

a few details about the crash which might

help us here.

LANGE (cont'd)

What you're recalling could be a

fabrication you've made up about it. Do

you follow?

FLASH BACK:

TREVOR

Kirsty. Jesus, wake up!

(CONTINUED)

19.

LANGE

Mr. Gooding? You still in there?

TREVOR

Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to

recollect, you know?

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my

wife was thrown from the car when it hit

the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped

inside.

LANGE'S VOICE

That's a start. I'll tell the people

trawling the river maybe it makes a

difference maybe not. Thanks for your

help Trevor. If we have any more

questions you'll get a call from myself

or my partner Detective Givens.

TREVOR

You guys know something I don't?

(CONTINUED)

20.

LANGE

All things considered we probably know a

lot less than you do. Have a good

afternoon, Mr. Gooding.

(CONTINUED)

21.

(CONTINUED)

22.

GOTHIC WOMAN

Here it is, what do you think?

GOTHIC WOMAN (CONT'D)

I saw it on the counter, looked at the

name and the rest is history. It's like,

named after me. Well...?

TREVOR

(getting uncomfortable)

Oh. Uh... it's beautiful. I'm sorry, I've

just been having a weird day...

TAWNY

I totally understand. Listen I don't know

if you're into incense but, I bought

some, it's called Witching Hour. To

inhale it is to love it. I mean the

stuff'll clear your head big time. Come

on over, I'll burn some for you. If you

can't sleep tonight...

TAWNY (CONT'D)

... knock on my door, I'm a total

insomniac.

TREVOR

No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-

TREVOR (CONT'D)

-Tawny.

TAWNY

(eyebrows raised)

Whew. You bounce right back don't you?

TREVOR

What do you mean?

TAWNY

Didn't your like... whole life get

totalled last week?

(CONTINUED)

23.

TREVOR

Last week...

TAWNY

The car accident? Any of this ringing a

bell?

TREVOR

It's not that kind of date.

TAWNY

Hey even if it is more power to ya.

(awkwardly)

Alrighty then. Have a good time.

KIRSTY

Well Trevor. It's been one year. Three

hundred sixty five days.

(CONTINUED)

24.

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

Eight thousand seven hundred sixty hours.

Five hundred twenty five thousand...

KIRSTY

How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for

a whole year.

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

In a word? Lucrative.

KIRSTY

The best business decision if you ever

made I'll bet.

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt

work for one second.

KIRSTY

You know what the family lawyer told me

one our wedding day?

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

What?

KIRSTY

Never to put you in my will.

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

Really? Why?

KIRSTY

Because you'd be staying with me for me

and not because you'd get rich if I died

for some reason.

TREVOR

But you had more wisdom than to listen to

a false prophet

KIRSTY

There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan

(prvb 21:30)

(CONTINUED)

25.

KIRSTY (CONT'D)

And besides, I thought, to hell with

it... it's okay if you only married me

for my money.

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

Really, why's that?

KIRSTY

I only married you for your body.

KIRSTY (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)

Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.

KIRSTY

For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here,

you.

TREVOR

Hello? Who's out there?

(CONTINUED)

26.

GWEN

Sorry I'm late dear.

TREVOR

Gwen you scared the living shit out of

me.

GWEN

You are turning into an old fuddy duddy.

Shoe.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Come on don't make me beat you.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Other shoe.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Good boy.

(looking around)

Where's is it?

TREVOR

What?

GWEN

Our little toy. You usually have it up

and running by now.

TREVOR

Do I really want to know what you're

talking about?

SMASH CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

27.

GWEN

You're kidding me.

TREVOR

I'm sorry Gwen. I just can't.

GWEN

You have definitely got a screw loose,

Trevor. Goodbye.

TREVOR

What the hell?

VIDEO GWEN

There's one thing I should have told you

right from the beginning Trevor.

(CONTINUED)

28.

VIDEO GWEN (CONT'D)

I like it pretty rough.

TREVOR

No!

ALLISON

Sorry I thought you were going to stay

under longer.

TREVOR

What's happening to me? What are you

doing?

ALLISON

You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep

and well, I took the liberty of...I'm

sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

TREVOR

I just had the most vivid dream. I was

sure I was dying.

ALLISON

Well you can relax now you are quite

alive. And as long as you're awake, chin

up.

(CONTINUED)

29.

ALLISON (CONT'D)

Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?

TREVOR

(groggily)

Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like

it's going through a meat grinder. I'm

not sure if I'm dreaming or...

ALLISON

(interupting) That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit

you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like

Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one

good thing about coming so near to the end of ones

life. Everything is new and exciting, like your

seeing it for the first time.

You might see things a litlle differently from now

on.

TREVOR

Your insight is enlightening.

ALLISON

No wisdom, no insight, no plan.

TREVOR

My wife said that exact same sentence to

me the day we got married. She even

winked too.

ALLISON

Do you use this wife thing to hit on all

the interns?

TREVOR

(smiling)

No... just you.

ALLISON

There. Just like a baby's butt.

(CONTINUED)

30.

TREVOR

Allison? Why can't remember what happened

to my wife? Is it something I'm on

that's... that's making me forget?

ALLISON

Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

TREVOR

No I need to remember. Look whatever it

is take me off it. I can handle pain. I

can't handle not knowing...

ALLISON

You need to get better first Trevor. Way

better.

(scribbling in the chart)

It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to

still love someone after they're gone.

But you've got to quit blaming yourself

okay...? Okay?

ALLISON

Trevor?

ALLISON (CONT'D)

CODE BLUE!

ALLISON (CONT'D)

It's okay Trevor I'm coming for you.

(CONTINUED)

31.

TREVOR

Shit, I'm gonna be late!

BRET

Must be nice.

TREVOR

What?

BRET

Getting paid for doing shit.

TREVOR

Come on, Bret.

(CONTINUED)

32.

BRET

Seriously man, you oughta work for the

government. You've got the sense of

urgency for it.

TREVOR

Look, I'm doing my best considering okay?

BRET

Hey if the boss doesn't notice who cares

right? Just slack all the live long day

if you want.

TREVOR

The boss won't notice me doing a bad job

because I'm not. Even if the boss thought

I was slacking I'd know right away.

BRET

Yeah, how's that?

TREVOR

(smug)

I have my connections

BRET

Really? Do tell.

TREVOR

(smiling)

Gwen.

BRET

GWEN?

TREVOR

I crap you not. She was all over me

yesterday in the break room. And she was

a total machine last night too.

BRET

You were supposed to have a date with

Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The

supervisor?

TREVOR

Serious as a heart attack my friend. I

think she literally fucked me brains out.

(CONTINUED)

33.

BRET

(super sarcastic)

Wow that's quite a feat Trevor

congratulations. Must be really tough to

get your brains fucked out by a CORPSE.

TREVOR

What are you talking about?

BRET

Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was

murdered here six months ago. The

security guard found her all over her

office. Her head was in the waste paper

basket. Her stomach was in the filing

cabinet. Her ass was on the copy

machine...

BRET (CONT'D)

They never found the sicko who did it...

remember?

TREVOR

(to himself)

Jesus Christ...

BRET

Man are you ever out of the loop. Either

that or you've got the worst sense of

humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What

is your problem anyway?

(CONTINUED)

34.

TREVOR

Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind.

And now I'm finding pieces of it, like

pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on

the side of the road.

BRET

Bud you need to decompress. I told you

you came back to work too soon after the

accident.

BRET (CONT'D)

Hey you know what Trev? I'm going to hook

you up man. Here...

BRET (CONT'D)

This woman will take one look at you and

know exactly what you need.

SAGE

These headaches you've been getting. Do

they happen in conjunction with the

hallucinations?

TREVOR

(unsure of himself)

Yes, sort of.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

35.

TREVOR (cont'd)

My head's been in constant pain since

the... accident. And the pain increases

whenever I, uh... slip into another, I

don't know what to call them...

SAGE

Dreams?

TREVOR

I was going to say dimensions. But I

guess technically they are dreams.

SAGE

You should always listen to your

subconscious. It's trying to tell you

something about your waking life.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

But I never feel like I'm sleeping. It's

sort of, waking narcolepsy. I'll be

somewhere and then-

(snapping his fingers)

-it's like I was never wherever I was to

begin with I was really somewhere else

entirely.

TREVOR (cont'd)

Ok, whatever that was...do it again.

That just set me free of the worlds

longest head ache. Is this making any

sense?

SAGE (CONT'D)

None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the

needles do the driving.

SAGE (CONT'D)

(patting his cheek)

Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

(CONTINUED)

36.

TREVOR

I'm thinking this might just be what I

needed.

PINHEAD

No matter what happens just remember...

PINHEAD (CONT'D)

We're all here for you Trevor.

quick cuts:

ALLISON

Shh. It's okay. Go back to sleep.

(CONTINUED)

37.

DARKENED MAN

I know. Divorce isn't good enough.

Abandonment isn't good enough. There's

only one way to do it and do it cleanly,

without leaving a trace of evidence.

DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)

Open this and your problem will disappear

forever. And no one will ever suspect

you. A word of caution though. A certain

side effect of the box. Pleasure.

Pleasures that would redefine the

parameters of sensation.

DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)

Once the cube is opened there is no

turning back. Ever.

RECEPTIONIST

Afternoon doll-face. Hey, a police

detective was just here to see you.

(looking at the card)

Some guy named Givens.

TREVOR

Uh thanks this looks a little important.

Could you let the folks upstairs know

I'll be late?

RECEPTIONIST

For you bubbalicious?

(winking)

I'd lay across a bed of nails.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

You know it girl. That ass is a three-

hummer baby. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

TREVOR

I'm sorry. I still... I don't understand

how this is a homicide case. I mean

nobody was murdered here... Her body's

been missing for I don't know how long

now and...

GIVENS

What did you just say?

TREVOR

I said she's been missing for-

GIVENS

No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.

TREVOR

What's the difference?

(CONTINUED)

39.

GIVENS

Last time anybody saw this woman she was

alive. You seem to certain she's dead.

TREVOR

(tearing up)

I saw her drowning inside the car,

detective.

GIVENS

I read up on you, man. You're a smart guy

aren't you? I mean with numbers. Right?

TREVOR

You could say that.

GIVENS

Zero's a number right?

TREVOR

As in one minus one equals zero yes.

Where are you going with this?

GIVENS

How many zeros was your wife worth?

TREVOR

I need to talk to my attorney. Now.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Yes I need LARRY ELLIS' office please.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

(a beat)

Yeah this is Trevor Gooding I need to

speak with Larry... Trevor...? Kirsty

Gooding's husband...?

(another beat)

I see do you know when he'll be out that

meeting? Fine I'll uh... call back

then... Okay you give him the message and

he'll call me that's great.

(CONTINUED)

40.

BRET

I don't know what pissed you off but it's

nice to see you getting the job done for

a change.

WOMAN'S VOICE

I'M SAVED! MY HERO!

ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE

(from TV)

-at the dawning of the agrarian age

goat's milk would be considered a

suitable substitute for a mother's breast

milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would

appease an angry god and ensure a

bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual

would become associated with less

hallowed purposes.

ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural

properties linked to black magic.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

41.

ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)

In conjunction with the pentangle- the

five pointed star- the spilling of goat's

blood is considered to be either an

aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic

orgies, or a means by which a high priest

may summon Satan himself.

ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)

(from TV)

The Book of Revelations speaks of the

anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes.

For centuries illustrators have chosen a

goat to represent this beast.

TAWNY

Hey. Can I borrow something?

TREVOR

Uh... sure, Tawny... what?

TAWNY

You.

(CONTINUED)

42.

TREVOR

Tawny? What's- what are you doing?

TAWNY

YOU!

TAWNY

You okay?

TREVOR

I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of

weird actually.

TAWNY

Really?

TAWNY (CONT'D)

I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!

TREVOR

I've never said this to a woman before

but can't we talk a little bit before

grabbing at each other?

TAWNY

(grinning)

God. Sometimes you can be such an animal.

Other times you are the ultimate tease...

(CONTINUED)

43.

TAWNY (CONT'D)

Taste this.

TREVOR

Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?

TAWNY

For starters. It's also got fennel,

asparagus, olives, some more of mother

nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college,

me and my roommates used to call it hard-

on stew.

TREVOR

Not a very appetizing name.

TAWNY

Have some more.

TAWNY (CONT'D)

If you ever smelled this coming from our

dorm room, you knew one of us was in

there getting laid.

TREVOR

You must have been very proud of

yourselves...

TAWNY

It's getting hot in here.

TREVOR

Jesus... who did that to you?

TAWNY

You're kidding right?

(CONTINUED)

44.

TAWNY (CONT'D)

You did! God, you are funny tonight.

TAWNY (CONT'D)

Almost like I'm with somebody else.

TREVOR

Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.

TAWNY

Well now there's a compliment.

ALLISON

Sorry about that. There was a blockage in

your oxygen hose. Won't happen again,

promise.

(CONTINUED)

45.

TREVOR

I'm certainly keeping you busy huh?

ALLISON

(smiling)

Too bad I hate my job...

ALLISON (CONT'D)

Feeling better now?

TREVOR

These hallucinations I'm having. I think

they're more like memories coming back to

me in a strange way.

ALLISON

Well that's not necessarily a bad thing

is it?

TREVOR

If they're blocked memories... I'm

starting to realize the reason why I

blocked them out. Allison I think I

really... screwed everything up.

ALLISON

Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

TREVOR

I miss her. I miss my wife.

ALLISON

If you need to cry, go ahead. I won't

tell.

46.

LANGE'S VOICE

(from answering machine)

This is Lange. We need to talk as soon as

possible. It's about your little...

dilemma. Give me a call.

(CONTINUED)

47.

TAWNY

Can I help you?

TREVOR

Tawny... I- you're-

TAWNY

Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude.

What do you want?

TREVOR

I... think we need to talk, there's

something really strange going on...

TAWNY

(a look of recognition)

Hey you're the guy from down the hall.

TREVOR

Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's

about... what we did together last night.

TAWNY

(utterly shocked)

WHAT?!

VOICE

Who the fuck is that?

TAWNY

It's that guy from down the hall. He

thinks we did something with him last

night.

TREVOR

Who's- who's in there with you...?

TAWNY

Are you cracking up or something?

(CONTINUED)

48.

BRUTE

What can we do for you, chief?

TREVOR

I... who are you?

BRUTE

You know Tawny, you better know me, pal.

TREVOR

Okay. I don't want any trouble. I was

mistaken... I'll see you later.

BRUTE

Much.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

City police main switchboard how may I

direct your call?

TREVOR

You already asked me that ten minutes ago

just before you put me on hold. I'm

looking for defective- I mean Detective

Lange.

OPERATOR

Oh he and his partner just stepped out to

lunch, can I-?

49.

TREVOR

Just open the doors I'll jump off.

BUS DRIVER

Not while the bus is moving, sir.

TREVOR

Where's my wife Detective Lange? What the

hell did you do with her?!

(CONTINUED)

50.

LANGE

Mr. Gooding I assure you we are doing

everything within our-

TREVOR

Why did you leave me that message?

LANGE

I don't know what you're talking about.

TREVOR

LIAR!

LARRY

(not looking up)

Basically they know where your wife's

body is and they're not telling you as a

tactic to get you to confess? Yet neither

of them has come out and told you that

you're a suspect. Is that what you're

trying to say?

TREVOR

Look Larry I know you never thought too

much of me. And I know this all sounds a

little fucked up.

LARRY

A little? Try unbelievably.

TREVOR

I swear these guys are like playing

mindgames with me. I think they got a

hold of my e-mail address at work too.

(CONTINUED)

51.

LARRY

Trevor barring the more outrageous

aspects of your claim you are not the

only widower the police have questioned

when foul play is suspected.

TREVOR

Hey ninety five point three percent of

all murders are committed by either a

spouse, a direct relative or a close

friend that's common knowledge. But this

wasn't murder it was an accident-

LARRY

(concentrating on his notes)

And as far as hiding a body goes? I find

it hard to believe even the dirtiest of

cops would keep a victim's remains hidden

simply to get someone to confess. It's

absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not

saying I don't believe you,

I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of

money behind all this.

TREVOR

How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty

is presumed dead?

LARRY

Rosie can you bring in the Gooding

papers?

ASSISTANT'S VOICE

(from intercom)

Right away Mr. Ellis.

TREVOR

Uh. Ballpark would be fine Larry.

LARRY

In the vicinity of eight million four

hundred fifty thousand. Or is it sixty-

TREVOR

What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's

murder?

LARRY

Well they'd have to prove it in a court

of law for one thing-

(CONTINUED)

52.

TREVOR

Please Larry. Pretend you like me and

humor me.

LARRY

Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and

I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's

entire estate would have to be donated to

the city.

TREVOR

Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking

conspiracy!

LARRY

Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound

like a raving lunatic. The next time you

seek counsel it should be of the

psychiatric type. You're obviously on the

verge of some nervous collapse.

TREVOR

Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck

you too.

LARRY

(to Trevor's back)

I never thought your late wife was the

sharpest knife in the drawer. But

marrying you was the dumbest thing she

ever did!

TREVOR

You can go. I'm going to be here a while.

53.

smash cut to:

ALLISON

Jesus I wish you would stop doing that.

TREVOR

Allison...

(CONTINUED)

54.

ALLISON

Well Trevor? What have you got to say for

yourself? Que pasa?

TREVOR

(voice quivering)

Allison we have GOT to talk about this

medication you've got me on.

ALLISON

I'm all over it.

ALLISON (CONT'D)

Blink.

ALLISON (CONT'D)

Okay. What we're going to do is up the

Topomax to two per day instead of one,

see if that takes care of these

hallucinatory seizures you've been

having. The extra Topomax won't interfere

with the painkillers either but... You're

going to be thrilled to hear this part

but we have been told by some patients it

affects the memory somewhat...

TREVOR

(weary)

Really? Does it affect the memory?

ALLISON

You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding.

You keep coming back to your corner for a

quick fix up then go right back out into

the ring for another round.

TREVOR

Some call it resilience. Others,

stupidity.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Everything okay Allison?

(CONTINUED)

55.

ALLISON

(surprised at her own emotional

outflow)

Of course, yes.

TREVOR

The way you just looked at me...

ALLISON

I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.

TREVOR

So, I'm done. Thats it for today?

ALLISON

All finished.

TREVOR (cont'd)

How bout some lunch?

TREVOR

Think about it. In the entire world

where's the most life-threatening place

you could possibly be at any given

moment.

ALLISON

I don't know... Beirut? New Orleans?

TREVOR

Hint. It's not a geographical location.

ALLISON

I'm stumped.

TREVOR

It's inside a moving car.

ALLISON

Bull...

(CONTINUED)

56.

TREVOR

I've got numbers to back me up. Over the

course of one year more Americans die in

car accidents than did during the entire

span of World War II.

ALLISON

Okay so... what's the safest place?

TREVOR

Statistically speaking? Inside a moving

bus.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Millions of people around the world get

on busses every day. When was the last

time you heard of anybody anywhere dying

on a public transit bus?

ALLISON

Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you.

What's the most common cause of death for

adults over the age of eighteen?

TREVOR

Please. Heart attack. That was easy

street.

ALLISON

Second most common?

TREVOR

Skin cancer.

ALLISON

Eighty third most common.

TREVOR

Pitbull attacks.

ALLISON

You just made that up.

TREVOR

Like you're gonna check.

ALLISON

Where you two happy together?

(CONTINUED)

57.

TREVOR

We startred off to be. She was, I guess I

was. I just sort of....butchered up the

relationship somehow. (to himself) Bad

choice of words.

ALLISON

I understand, I think. Other women?

TREVOR

Yeah. It's like I was a different guy

then I am today. I can't remember that

guy. I see these women, they think I'm

someone else, and I'm not that guy

anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.

ALLISON

You were unfaithful, it sounds like your

confessing.

TREVOR

I did more then that.

ALLISON

Com'on.   How bout some fresh air?

TREVOR

Lucky for us these chairs happened to be

here.

ALLISON

Oh I knew about the chairs already. This

is where the emphysema patients come to

sneak cigarettes.

ALLISON (CONT'D)

Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?

TREVOR

No. She just would have loved it up

here... Allison when I was under... did I

ever talk?

(CONTINUED)

58.

ALLISON

Sure plenty of times.

TREVOR

Was there anything I said that made you

stop and wonder, you know, "where did

that come from?"

ALLISON

Sure plenty of times.

TREVOR

Well?

ALLISON

Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep

state they are obviously dreaming. So

practically everything say is going to

sound strange.

TREVOR

Did I ever talk about the accident?

ALLISON

No.

TREVOR

Did I ever talk about Kirsty?

ALLISON

No. But at one point you did repeat

something though. A phrase. You must have

been having this recurring dream, you

just kept saying this one thing over and

over

TREVOR

What was it?

ALLISON

You said, "Jealousy arouses a husbands

fury, and he will show no mercy when he

takes revenge." (Proverbs 6:34) Does that

mean anything to you Trevor?

TREVOR

It means I have alot more questions.

ALLISON

Times up for today. I've got to get back.

(CONTINUED)

59.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Sorry.

ALLISON

If it makes you feel better that took

every ounce of self control I had.

Trevor, I never date patients.

TREVOR

I understand... I won't-

ALLISON

No you don't understand. That's why I've

been fighting to get you better. So you

wouldn't be a patient anymore.

TREVOR

Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would

have switched doctors!

ALLISON

Just get better okay?

ALLISON (CONT'D)

I have to get back to work. And so do

you.

TREVOR

Don't say a word, Bret.

BRET

TREVOR

No please make yourself at home.

LANGE

How's everything, Mr. Gooding?

TREVOR

Can't we dispense with the games for

once?

LANGE

I thought you loved games.

TREVOR

I'll just stay out of this conversation

until you come out and tell me why you've

disrupted me at work.

LANGE

You and your wife were playing a game

shortly before you got into that car

accident weren't you?

TREVOR

Where is she? Where is my wife?

LANGE

We found this curious little object not

too far from the site of the accident. No

prints but forensics scraped a little

dark residue that was caked on one of the

corners. It was blood Trevor. Matched

some blood we took off your car seat too.

Can you tell me anything about it?

(CONTINUED)

61.

TREVOR

(to Lange)

It looks familiar. I think it was in the

car...

LANGE

Gee you think so?

LANGE (CONT'D)

Sorry to take up your time like that

Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I

forget. I talked your neighbor out of

pressing charges.

TREVOR

What?

LANGE

The whackjob in the black lipstick who

lives down the hall? She wanted you

arrested for harassment. I told her to

chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the

other way as long as she did you know?

TREVOR

Thanks.

TREVOR

What's the occasion?

BRET

I quit. Today's my last day.

BRET

I've got a better offer. More time off. A

sort of career shift, more in the

engineering line of work.

TREVOR

How much time off?

BRET

As much as he feels like. Its a much more

pleasurable line of work.

TREVOR

As much as he likes?

BRET

Yahtzee. Were all in this together Trev.

Trevor there are people who are doing

exactly what we're doing but they don't

need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have

some tight assed supervisor breathing

down their necks. Its all about the

pleasure Trevor!

(CONTINUED)

63.

TREVOR

So you're just packing it up just like

that?

BRET

Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends

to tie up first. Came into a shitload of

money recently. I've always wanted to go

to take a trip. We're just gonna walk

into the airport and decide right then

and there.

TREVOR

Yeah? You and who else?

I'm sure she works there I've been in and

out of that place five times in the last

month...! Well good day to you too

SAGE'S VOICE

Hello?

TREVOR

Sage it's me Trevor. You've got to help

me.

TREVOR

The feeling is very distinct. It's like

somebody stuck a shard of glass through

my eye and it's embedded halfway into my

brain.

SAGE

Trevor your body has been completely

healed. All the nerve endings have

repaired themselves. If there is any pain

in your head it's... in your head.

TREVOR

Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.

SAGE

You are physically better. It's your soul

that still hurts.

SAGE (CONT'D)

My teacher told me once there's a

puncture point on your body that can lock

your soul within it, even after you're

dead. So that when you die you're trapped

inside your body, watching it corrode for

all eternity.

TREVOR

Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you,

forget. You've got to get this fuckin

pain to stop.

(CONTINUED)

67.

SAGE

It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up

inside you. You need to free it Trevor.

You've blocked it from the healing

process. That's what we need to do now.

Heal your soul. And to do that I you have

to give in utterly and without any

hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I

mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do

you trust me implicitly?

TREVOR

I don't even know what's real and what

isn't how can I trust anyone?

SAGE

You can trust me. Your wife is dead and

you need to move past that. And the only

way to move past something completely is

to go straight through it, not around it.

Surrender yourself to your wife's death.

Let it chew you up and spit you back out

on the other side. It's the only way you

can become whole again.

SAGE (CONT'D)

Are you ready?

TREVOR

I surrender...

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Wait... what the hell is this...

SAGE

(whispering)

Surrender yourself... surrender

yourself...

on a name before we reach my mother's.

preschool as student x if we don't make

up our minds. So, I've been thinking,

what about Daisy?

patients a day and have an awful memory.

TREVOR

DR. AMBROSE (CONT'D)

Right. Trevor you just had a seizure

brought on by a severe migraine. Things

could be much worse. In the next few days

out of the sun and make sure you've had

at least eight glasses of water by the

time you go to bed at night.

DR. AMBROSE

Who's Allison?

TREVOR

Allison Dormere. Your intern.

DR. AMBROSE

TREVOR

Allison I think I did some very, very bad

things. I mean very bad.

ALLISON

Trevor things like this happen to people

who experience temporary memory loss.

Everybody does things they regret. You

just couldn't remember doing these things

and now you are so it's a shock to the

system. I'm telling you. You will never

get better if you keep blaming yourself

for your wife's death.

TREVOR

Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car

accident...

OLD MAN

Hey buddy!

BUS DRIVER

This is it mister.

BUS DRIVER (CONT'D)

Have a good night now.

TREVOR

I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not

even Catholic. I just had to tell

somebody. It's like, ever since my wife

died I don't know what I've actually done

or what I've imagined. But I do know if

one tenth of what's happening to me is

reality... I've done some really awful

things in my life. Things that I've... I

guess I've blocked out...

PRIEST

What things do you think you've done?

TREVOR

Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little

time. For starters I was responsible for

the death my wife who by the way was

carrying my unborn child. That was so I

could collect her eight million dollar

estate. I think I killed several women I

was having mindless sex with behind her

back.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

75.

TREVOR (cont'd)

But I did those murders just for the hell

of it. Finally... I think I made some

kind of deal with the devil and now he's

come to collect my soul. Only he's

decided to mess with my head first. How

many Hail Marys do you recommend for that

one father?

PRIEST

Trevor I'm sure you killed no one. You

are very distraught over your wife's

death and rightfully so. You did the

right thing by confessing to me here

tonight. And you should keep praying for

the wisdom that will set your soul at

ease. That being said, you are still in a

highly emotional state right now. It

might do you some good to get some

professional help. Confess to them the

way you confessed to me. In time you'll

probably find that the real killer has

already been caught. Or better yet...

that these murders never happened at all.

TREVOR

But I saw these women. I saw their

mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I

just know it happened I can feel it...

PRIEST

All you've got is the here and the now

Trevor. That's all anyone really has.

Maybe this will make things easier to

understand. A man goes to sleep every

night and has recurring dream that he's a

butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if

he might actually be a butterfly who

dreams he's a man. And at the end of the

day does it even matter? All these events

you're describing. How can you be sure

any of them really happened?

TREVOR

But that's what I need. To be sure... to

be absolutely sure...

PRIEST

Shh. It's okay son. There is but one

truth. One thing you can be absolutely

sure of. And that thing is this:

even joke about it.

TREVOR

Bret. What the hell is going on?

BRET

We were gonna be millionaires you said.

Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never

even met her. No connection. Then you

went and had that fucking car accident.

TREVOR

Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.

BRET

I followed her Trevor. I got to know her

life. And what a boring one it was. Six

a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop,

noon bookstore, one soap operas, four

o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to

come home. And wait and wait and wait.

Nine o'clock get ready for bed.

BRET (cont'd)

Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the

TV. She did that every day I followed

her. Every single day. While you were out

fucking your concubines. Every day I felt

more and more bad for her, man. And hated

you more and more.

BRET (CONT'D)

Then I find out you're having nooners

with my GWEN. That was all I could take.

I didn't want to kill your wife anymore.

I wanted to kill you. Even before that

little accident I decided to do it on the

day we'd set aside for her.

BRET (CONT'D)

But now that ain't gonna happen either. I

fell in love with Kirsty Trevor. The day

she died it was like my soul had been

Thank you!

BRUTE

I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker!

BRUTE (CONT'D)

(to Trevor)

YOU'RE GONNA BURN IN HELL!!

COP#1

Got quite a fan club don't you, hotshot?

TREVOR

For the last time. I honestly don't know

how any of them died...

GIVENS

Now I want you to tell me what you

remember happening- in your own words-

exactly the way you told Detective Lange.

But this time I want you to make one

small adjustment.

TREVOR

What's that?

(CONTINUED)

83.

LANGE

DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME!

TREVOR

I did it. I killed them all. I confess.

LANGE

(to the cops)

Quick detour through the morgue boys.

TREVOR

Morgue...?

LANGE

That's right Trevor. The timing was

impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight

months two weeks and three days but we

finally found the body. Just need you to

ID it for us.

TREVOR

Where was it?

LANGE (CONT'D)

That's the weird part. It just magically

turned up in the river less than thirty

yards from where the car had landed. Like

somebody put it there while we weren't

looking.

(CONTINUED)

84.

LANGE

Just keep walking Trevor. You can't miss

it.

(CONTINUED)

85.

PINHEAD

How is our little student doing? Has he

learned his lesson yet?

TREVOR

I don't know who you are or what you

want. I just want to know what's under

that sheet...

PINHEAD

Use your mind for something other than

numbers dear Trevor. Think about people

for a change. People other than yourself.

Like the women you slept with behind your

wife's back. You were always so confident

you had covered your tracks. Always

confident your wife actually believed

your fervent denials? Part of you must

have known she would find out.

flaSH BACK:

PINHEAD (O.S.)

Jealousy arouses a spouse's fury.

And no mercy will be shown when that

revenge is given.

(CONTINUED)

86.

PINHEAD

Even a mind as narcissistic as yours

must have wondered: What unspeakable acts

was your wife committing behind YOUR

back?

KIRSTY

(to camera)

Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch!

bacK TO:

TREVOR

What's under that sheet...?

PINHEAD

You probably don't remember the night we

played. Your first year as husband and

wife.

flASH BACK:

PINHEAD (V.O.)

It must have seemed like we were

uninvited guests crashing your little

celebration.

PINHEAD (V.O.)

But someone was expecting us Trevor. And

everything went according to plan.

baCK TO:

87.

PINHEAD

We were about to come for Kirsty. When we

were offered a deal. We don't usually

consider bargains but this one was too

good to pass up. A tribute to the

resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on

protecting its spawn. The deal we were

offered was this: three more souls in

exchange for the life of the unborn child

inside Kirsty. The three souls had

already been picked out. Needless to say

we were very impressed.

PINHEAD (CONT'D)

Two of your favorite companions, most

supple and delicious as you already know.

And the man you had at one time conspired

to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out

she was with child.

smASH CUT TO:

PINHEAD (CONT'D)

They were all real screamers too. We had

a blast. And there was one more. You've

seen many things you wished you hadn't.

Many nightmares from which you never

awoke. They were all clues in our little

puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you

guess the fifth soul chosen for us to

torment in this little agreement?

TREVOR

WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET?

(CONTINUED)

88.

PINHEAD

(smiling)

Welcome to the worst nightmare of them

all, Trevor. Reality.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

No... no...

flASH BACK:

LANGE

Open this and your problem will disappear

forever. And no one will ever suspect

you.

KIRSTY

Shhh it's okay.

baCK TO:

TREVOR (CONT'D)

NOOO!!

(CONTINUED)

89.

KIRSTY'S VOICE

Yes. Yes that's him.

LANGE

Well I guess that's it then. Thank you

Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have

been tough.

DR. AMBROSE

Alrighty. Let's get started folks.

SAGE

Collecting 40ccs of serum...

AMBROSE

Examining cranial fracture...

AMBROSE (CONT'D)

Checking oral cavity for blockage...

AMBROSE (CONT'D)

And we have a winner...

(CONTINUED)

90.

ALLISON

Looks like an eel of some kind.

AMBROSE

Guess it was murder after all.

SAGE

Yeah all we need is the eel's motive.

ALLISON

I still don't get it. He's been missing

for almost eight months. But this body

hasn't been dead more than twenty four

hours.

DR. AMBROSE

Makes you wonder what he was up to

between the time he disappeared and when

he died.

ALLISON

Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?

DR. AMBROSE

(shivering)

Allison what on earth possesses you to

converse with cadavers?

SAGE

(looking at Trevor's corpse)

It's simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there

is no afterlife? What happens when we

die? Do we just stay stuck inside your

bodies for eternity watching ourselves

decompose?

AMBROSE

I'm not following this...

ALLISON

Well if that's the case... wouldn't you

want someone to talk to you like a normal

human being one last time?

AMBROSE

You two are creeping me out. And I'm a

coroner.

(CONTINUED)

91.

ALLISON (O.S.)

Adios amigo.

KIRSTY

I would have come in sooner but I had an

important errand to run last night. Out

of town. Figures you'd find his body the

minute I decide to go off somewhere.

LANGE

Well you made it down here that's the

important part. Thank you for your

patience Mrs. Gooding.

LANGE (CONT'D)

One last thing... When they found him he

was holding something. Not to get too

graphic but they had to wrench it from

his hand.

LANGE (CONT'D)

Figured you might want it.

KIRSTY

Of course. That was my... last

anniversary present to him.

LANGE

A token to remember him by now. Goodbye

Mrs. Gooding.

(CONTINUED)

92.

KIRSTY

Thank you detective.

LARRY

Looking for someone, Kirsty?

KIRSTY

(taking the baby)

You bet I was.

KIRSTY (CONT'D)

(to Nanny)

Okay we're on our way. Remember her-

NANNY

Lactose intolerance. I've stocked the

fridge with Lactaid.

KIRSTY

See you in a couple of weeks. You've got

my cell number right?

(CONTINUED)

93.

LARRY

Daisy is getting so big.

(beat)

I still can't believe HE was her father.

KIRSTY

Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore.

Can we just start spending HIS money

instead.

LARRY

I've always wanted to go to Madagascar.

KIRSTY

You mean the place with bats?

LARRY

They're called flying lemurs.

KIRSTY

Yeah that sounds like a real blast...

KIRSTY (cont'd)

I've been thinking about it. This has to

have been the best eight months of my

life.

LARRY (CONT'D)

TAXI!

LANGE

You forgot something.

KIRSTY

Oh. Thank you.

(CONTINUED)

94.

LANGE (CONT'D)

No Mrs. Gooding.

GIVENS

Thank YOU.

LARRY

After you my dear.

LARRY

(to the cabbie)

Airport please.

LARRY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

What's up?

KIRSTY

Time, Larry. Time's up.
