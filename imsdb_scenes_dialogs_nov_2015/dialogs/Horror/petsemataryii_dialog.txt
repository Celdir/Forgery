PET SEMATARY II

An Original screenplay by Richard Outten

Revised by David S. Goyer

DIRECTOR (O.S.)

(exasperated)

Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we

throw some light on the set?

GENVIEVE

I'm sorry...

FIRST A.D.

Water in the pool's running low,

fill her up!

PUPPETEER

I can't see shit down there! I'm

working blind!

RENEE

This is great, I could've spent

four months on a romantic comedy

with Warren Beatty, and instead,

I've got a horny zombie trying to

cop a feel!

RENEE

Uhgh, there's water everywhere...

(beat)

Can I get a cigarette?

RENEE

(calling out)

Geoff?

(beat)

Anybody see my boy?

GEOFF (O.S.)

Right here, Mom...

RENEE

How long have you been here?

GEOFF

Couple minutes. I saw the last

shot. That was pretty cool.

RENEE

(casually)

How did it go with your father

last night?

GEOFF

Good. He said he'd be over for

dinner at eight...

(awkward)

I mean... he misses you, Mom...

RENEE

I miss him too...

RENEE

(continuing)

I just don't want you to get your

hopes up, okay? We're trying to

work things out, but...

GEOFF

I know, Mom.

RENEE

(affectionate)

You know everything, don't you?

FIRST A.D.

Okay, people! Quiet! We're going

to try this another time!

GEOFF

Guess it's showtime.

RENEE

Yep.

DIRECTOR

Alright, Renee. Last time. I

promise. We nail this and you

won't have to do this ever again.

RENEE

That's what you said the first

time...

OPERATOR

Rolling. Speed...

SLATE BOY

"Castle of Terror." Scene 69A.

Take thirteen.

DIRECTOR

Action!

ELECTRICIAN

Jesus! We've crossed over into

220! Shut down the generator!

GEOFF

Mom!!!!

CUT TO:

CHASE

I think this is probably for the

best. He's a very old dog. He

has arthritis. He has cataracts

in his eyes...

CHASE

He's had a good life...

(to dog)

...haven't you, boy?

INTERCOM

Doctor Matthews, your son is on

line one. He says it's an

emergency...

PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)

Run me down a line of normal

saline.

PARAMEDIC (O.S.)

We have a bradycardic rhythm at

30.

PARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.)

White female. Approximately

thirty five years old.

Electrocution...

PARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.)

She's in V-fib.

PARAMEDIC (O.S.)

Clear.

GEOFF

No...

GEOFF

You have to bring her back...

CHASE

Oh Jesus...

GEOFF

(helpless)

Dad...

PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)

(urgent)

We're losing her...

HANDLER #1

Is it true she grew up around

here?

HANDLER #2

Yeah. Over in Ludlow.

HANDLER #1

Huh. Never met a movie star

before.

HANDLER #3

Well you're a little late for an

autograph.

DISSOLVE TO:

PRIEST (V.O.)

...I am the resurrection and the

life, saith the Lord...

RENEE HALLOW MATTHEWS

1955-1991

PRIEST (V.O.)

...She that believeth in me,

though she were dead, yet shall

she live; and whosoever liveth and

believeth in me, shall never

die...

GUS

(drawing near)

Let's keep it back, folks.

Try to show her a little

respect...

GUS

Hey! What did I just say?

REPORTER

Ass-hole...

PRIEST (V.O.)

I know that my redeemer liveth,

and that he shall stand at the

latter day upon the earth.

GUS

Did she always have reporters

following her around like this?

CHASE

Pretty much so.

GUS

I hear you moved into town.

CHASE

I wanted to get Geoff out of

L.A. Just start things over, you

know?

GUS

I remember when Renee left. She

couldn't wait to get out of

Ludlow. She used to say that

life moved too slow here...

CHASE

That's Renee alright.

GUS

I suppose so.

CUT TO:

MOVER (O.S.)

We've got six more of these. You

sure you want them all in the

attic?

CHASE

...Geoff, what if we just give

the clothes to Goodwill? We'll

keep the rest. Just the clothes.

GEOFF

You're the one who wanted to move.

Nobody would've touched them if

you didn't want to move here...

CHASE

All the 'Renee' boxes go in the

attic. Sorry.

MARJORIE

Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your

new housekeeper.

MARJORIE

(re: Chase's reaction)

Is something wrong?

CHASE

Uh... no. You just... look

different than you sounded on the

phone. Please, come in.

MARJORIE

I'm real excited about working

for you Mr. Matthews...

CHASE

Well we're glad to have you,

Marjorie. You can call me Chase,

by the way.

MARJORIE

I've always admired Ms. Hallow.

That scene she did in Blue

Midnight, where her lover meets

her at the train station...

(she sighs)

I must've watched that movie four

times.

MARJORIE

Oh. I'll get that...

MARJORIE

This is gorgeous. She wore this

at the Emmys, didn't she?

GEOFF

Hey, don't touch her stuff. It

made her crazy when people touched

her stuff.

Serving Aroostook County

CHASE

This doesn't look so bad...

GEOFF

How long ago did this guy retire?

CHASE

It's been a few years.

GEOFF

(skeptical)

A few?

CHASE

What's wrong?!

GEOFF

(embarrassed)

Nothing. I just got spooked by a

bunch of furballs.

CHASE

Great, now I've opened an

orphanage too.

GEOFF

Well, I'll take one. If it's

okay...

GEOFF

She looks like a tiger.

CHASE

Tell you what, you do some

sweeping up here, and she's yours.

VOICE (O.S.)

Drew, you get a handle on that

dog, now!

DREW

Sorry. He gets kinda hyper...

GUS

Hell, he thought it was lunch.

How ya doin', Chase?

(a handshake)

You haven't met my boy.

(aside)

Drew, where the hell are your

manners.

GEOFF

He's a cool lookin' dog.

GEOFF

What's his name?

DREW

Zowie.

GUS

Damn dog stuck his nose in on my

rabbits and they ganged up on him.

I swear that dog's an idiot.

DREW

Is he gonna be okay?

CHASE

Let's have him hop up here.

GUS

When I was young I thought cats

were the girls and dogs were the

boys.

CHASE

There are three more girls where

that one came from looking for

homes.

GUS

Not our home.

CHASE

Thee facial lacerations should heal

up pretty quickly. I'll give you

som antibiotic cream--

GUS

--Drew, he's your dog. Are you

listening to this?

CHASE

His left eye is scratched, corneal

abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but

it's going to take som time. Try

to keep him away from those

rabbits, huh?

GUS

(to Chase)

I hear you've got Marjorie

Hargrove working for you now.

CHASE

How'd you know that?

GUS

It's a small town, Chase.

GUS

Hey Geoff, did you know your

mother and I used to be high-

school sweethearts?

GEOFF

Really?

GUS

(nodding)

Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine

yards.

(to Chase)

Course that was a lifetime ago.

CHASE

What's a lunch cost these days?

You want ten?

GEOFF

(unenthused)

Sure.

CHASE

You nervous? New town, new

school. I know it must be pretty

hard for you...

GEOFF

(cutting him off)

I'll be fine, Dad.

CHASE

(awkward)

Geoff... you have to help me out

here a little...

CHASE

Are you sure you don't want me to

pick you up. It's a long ride.

GEOFF

That's what my bike's for...

PRICELESS KITTENS

FREE TO A GOOD HOME

CLYDE

Check it out. That's the new kid.

The son of that movie star.

MRS. GORDON

People, this is Geoff Matthews.

He'll be joining our class for the

rest of the school year...

DOUG

Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do

you know Eddie Murphy?

GEOFF

(annoyed)

No.

MRS. GORDON

Why don't we save that for later,

Doug?

SUSAN

What about Julia Roberts?

MRS. GORDON

Susan! That'll be enough.

CLYDE

What's the hurry, Junior? Where

you off to?

CLYDE

(feigning remorse)

Too bad about your Mom. Papers

said it was pretty gross, getting

fried like that. Guess you saw

it, huh?

CLYDE

So, what are you hiding there?

STEVIE

When you bring a friend to school

you're supposed to introduce him.

GEOFF

Her name's Tiger.

CLYDE

Tiger? Don't you think that's

kind of a pussy name?

(reaching out)

Can I hold her? I promise I'll be

real careful.

CLYDE

Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a

kitten run?

GEOFF

I've seen her run around the

house.

CLYDE

No, I mean really run...

(beat)

Like this!

GEOFF

Shit...

CLYDE

Having fun yet?

GEOFF

Just give me the cat, all right?

CLYDE

I would but... there was a little

accident...

(feeding off Geoff's

alarm)

She was trying to get away. You

know, running down my leg... and

her head got too close to the

spokes. Pretty gross. What's

left of her is up in the Pet

Sematary. A zip-lock bag might

help...

(shrugs)

...but I happen to be out of them

at the moment.

DREW

Come on, Clyde, just tell him

where the cat is...

CLYDE

(turning on Drew)

...I TOLD HIM where the cat is!

Now shut up, fuck-face!

CLYDE

(relishing the

moment)

You heard about the Creed murders

yet? And the place where the dead

come back to life?

CLYDE

(continuing)

It's just back there. Just down

that path...

DREW

(meekly)

Clyde... it's not funny anymore.

CLYDE

Oh? So you got a problem?

What're you gonna do, fat-ass? You

gonna sic big, bad, old Gus after

me?

CLYDE

What do you think, Geoff? Maybe

you could dig up your Mom and take

her back there. Maybe if you pray

real hard, she'll come back.

GEOFF

(quietly)

Just give me the cat, ass-hole.

CLYDE

Excuse me, maybe I'm a little hard

of hearing... but did you just call

me an ass-hole?

CLYDE

You mad, Geoff? Cause if you are,

you should take a shot at me...

CLYDE

Come on, you pussy! What's the

matter with you?

CLYDE

Fuckin' ass-hole.

CLYDE

This way, fat-boy.

DREW

I've never seen anybody punch

Clyde before.

GEOFF

(shrugs)

He pissed me off.

DREW

(his smile fading)

Sorry about your mom.

(beat)

I couldn't handle not having my

mom around. Just having Gus...

GEOFF

My dad's not so bad.

DREW

I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was

dead...

GEOFF

(serious)

You shouldn't ever say that about

your parents, not even your Dad.

DREW

Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

GEOFF

What was all that stuff about dead

people coming back to life?

DREW

Nothing. It's just an old ghost

story. Let's get out of here...

CHASE

(calling after him)

Hey! How was your first day at

school?

GEOFF

(over his shoulder)

It sucked.

MARJORIE

Now is that any way to talk to

your father?

GEOFF

You're not my mother.

CHASE

Sorry.

GUS

Way to go, Romeo...

GUS

Drew, I don't remember inviting

Zowie in for dinner.

DREW

Just until he heals up?

AMANDA

Gus, please...

GUS

God damn, you're good.

GUS

You're breaking the law here,

Drew.

AMANDA

Really, Gus. It won't bother me.

GUS

Your mom's spent the last hour

cooking. Stop being a little jerk

and show her some appreciation.

GUS

Not that much appreciation. I

thought we were gonna tone down

that flabby ass.

DREW

Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud

that you are.

AMANDA

Knock it off, guys...

GUS

(to Drew, quietly)

You watch that mouth of yours,

Drew buddy.

GUS

Damn it, Drew. That dog is

history!

DREW

Don't shoot him!

GUS

What, Drew? What did you say?!

AMANDA

Jesus, Gus, what have you done?

GUS

Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking

at me like that. He's had ample

warning about that dog.

DISSOLVE TO:

GEOFF

I was just going by your house.

Where's your bike?

DREW

Zowie's dead.

DREW

I have to bury him. I don't want

to go out there alone.

GEOFF

Is this a good spot?

DREW

I'm not burying him here...

GEOFF

Why not?

DREW

There's a better place...

DREW

It's back here somewhere, through

the Indian woods. I know we can

find it...

GEOFF

Hey, wait up!

GEOFF

(uneasy)

Drew, where are we going?

DREW

This is it... I wasn't sure if it

even really existed.

GEOFF

What did?

DREW

The old Indian burial ground.

GEOFF

Come on, that's just a bullshit

story. You said so yourself...

DREW

What if it's not bullshit? If I

bury Zowie there, and it works...

(beat)

...he'll come back alive.

GEOFF

Drew, I know your dog died, but...

get a grip, man, you're freaking

me out.

DREW

Look, if there was even one chance

in a million it'd work, wouldn't

you want to try?

GEOFF

Look, let's just get this over

with.

DREW

If this doesn't work... don't ever

tell anyone I did this, okay? You

gotta promise...

GEOFF

You want me to help?

DREW

You have to bury your own. That's

the way the Indians did it. It's

like a rule...

DREW

What if he really does come back?

DREW

I've never had anyone die

before...

(beat)

...but I guess you get over it. I

mean, eventually...

GEOFF

(quietly)

You never get over it.

GEOFF

It's getting pretty late. We

better go.

DREW

(disappointed)

Yeah...

DREW

So long, Zowie...

GUS

Get in.

GUS

Your momma's worried sick over

you. You take off in the middle

of the night, you don't show up

for school. What're you trying to

prove?

DREW

I'm not trying to prove anything.

(beat)

I was burying my dog.

GUS

Life is full of lessons. No one's

above it. Not you. Not me...

Now get in the car.

AMANDA

Zowie?

GUS (O.S.)

Drew, you unlock this door! Right

now!

AMANDA (O.S.)

Unlock it, Drew!

DREW

What did I do now?

AMANDA

Open the door, Drew.

GUS

Where do you come off lying like

that? "I'm burying my dog." You

think a lie like that's never

gonna catch up to you?

DREW

(a whisper)

Zowie...

GUS

Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going

outside. You're grounded, buddy.

That's the new law.

AMANDA

I never knew an open wound could

smell so bad...

(beat)

Honey, he should have been looked

at this morning. I don't know

what you were thinking. It's a

wonder he's still alive.

CHASE

(gently)

Geoff...

CHASE

Geoff!

GEOFF

What?

CHASE

You alright?

GEOFF

Dad... do you think...

(beat)

...you think you and Mom would've

gotten back together?

CHASE

I think so.

CHASE

(continuing)

Your Mom and I loved each other,

Geoff. Don't ever think that we

didn't.

GEOFF

I still can't believe she's

dead...

GEOFF

Who was that?

CHASE

Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He

got hurt again. I'm going over to

take a look at him.

GEOFF

I'm going with you.

CHASE

How'd it happen?

DREW

(glaring at Gus)

Some psycho hunter probably got

trigger happy...

CHASE

I'm going to give Zowie a local

anaesthetic so I can clean up the

wound. I'd like to take him home

tonight for observation.

AMANDA

Fine.

DREW

Can you keep him at your place

until he gets better?

CHASE

Sure...

GEOFF

Maybe he wasn't dead when we

buried him.

DREW

He was dead. You know he was.

DREW

You can't tell anyone, Geoff.

Ever.

VOICE (O.S.)

Sleep tight, darling. I'll be

with you soon.

GEOFF

Mom!!!

DREW

What's the deal?

CHASE

I don't know. He's had three

days. His immune system should've

responded by now...

CHASE

I can't seem to find a pulse... it

must be so weak, it's not

registering...

UNIVERSITY OF MAINE

School of Veterinary Medicine

Lab Samples Enclosed

GEOFF

We'll take him back to the

kennels, Dad.

GEOFF

You think my Dad'll figure out why

he's not getting better?

DREW

You think he'd believe it if he

did?

GEOFF

How can he not have a heartbeat?

DREW

(worried)

Maybe it takes a while...

CUT TO:

MARJORIE

So who're you going as, Wayne

Gretzky?

GEOFF

I'm going as Jason.

MARJORIE

Jason? Who's he play for?

GEOFF

He doesn't. He hacks people up.

GEOFF

I'm late.

CHASE

Hey! Where're you off to?

GEOFF

I'm going out, Dad!

CHASE

Out?

MARJORIE

He's probably going up to the Pet

Sematary. Kids've been going out

there on Halloween night for

years.

CHASE

What do they do up there?

MARJORIE

Oh, you know... drink beer, tell

ghost stories. They try and spook

each other out, talking about

zombies and things...

(she shrugs)

It's no big deal, Chase. I did it

when I was young.

AMANDA

Hold still. Hold still.

AMANDA

You make sure you're home by ten.

If Gus finds out I let you go...

DREW

(sighs)

I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry.

I won't let Gus blow up again...

AMANDA

Drew, I know Gus isn't your

father, but you never even knew

your real father. He walked out

on the both of us, and you

remember that.

(beat)

Gus isn't that way. He has it in

him to love us both. You just

have to give him a chance...

VOICE (O.S.)

Geoff, honey. Mommy's here...

CLYDE

Look at this, Junior here

practically shit his pants.

CLYDE

Maybe you're too chicken to hang

out with the rest of the boys.

You gonna run home to Daddy now?

GEOFF

Fuck off.

AMANDA

You're home early.

GUS

Nope. Just ran out of smokes.

GUS

Where's the boy?

AMANDA

Uh... in his room...

GUS (O.S.)

DREW!

GUS

God damn it, Amanda! You want me

to be a father to the boy, and as

soon as I lay down the law, you

let him break it!

GUS

Where is he?

GUS

WHERE IS YOUR SON!?

AMANDA

The Pet Sematary.

CLYDE

...yeah, that old Louis was one

sick fuck... digging up little Gage

like so, maggots pouring out of

that kid's eyes...

CLYDE

Ellie was the only Creed that

lived. Then one night a few

months later, Ellie freaks out,

and she hacks up her grandparents

with an axe!

(beat)

Police found her licking their

brains off the blade... They

locked her up in a psycho ward and

all she said were two words: 'Pet

Sematary. Pet Sematary.'

CLYDE

Oh yeah! Almost forgot! Here's

the best part. Two nights ago she

escapes. Word is, she was heading

for Maine. Man I hope she doesn't

show up out here.

(feigning concern)

Shit, we wouldn't even notice her,

not if she's wearing a costume.

She could be one of us...

CLYDE

Oh my Goddd!!!

CLYDE

It's... It's...

CLYDE

Shit! It's Drew's Dad. It's

fuckin' Gus!

GUS

You boys better not be drinking!

DREW

Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass...

CLYDE

Thanks for fucking up our

Halloween, dumbshit!

GUS

Drew, you get your ass out here!

Front and center!

GUS

Get out here, Joker.

GUS

You out here making a fool of me?

GUS

I'm warning you, buddy! You don't

play by the rules, I'm gonna

shadow your ass for eternity!

GUS

You little shit!

GUS

You get out of here, Geoff

Matthews! This is between me and

my boy!

GUS

Call off your dog, Drew.

GUS

(terrified)

Drew, call him off!

DREW

Zowie...

GUS

DREW!

DREW

Oh, God. Oh, God...

GEOFF

(a whisper)

Is he dead?

GEOFF

Is he breathing? Can you hear him

breathing?

DREW

Oh man, Geoff... we killed him...

we killed him...

(beat)

What're we gonna do?

GEOFF

We could bring him back.

CUT TO:

AMANDA

Jesus, Drew, do you know what time

it is? Did Gus ever find you?

AMANDA

(calling after him)

Drew? Drew, what happened?

DREW

(trying not to lose

it)

Nothing happened, Mom. We just

ditched Gus, that's all...

CHASE

Were you drinking?

CHASE

Drew's Mom called hours ago, the

rest of the kids were back by ten.

Where the hell were you boys?

GEOFF

Just out.

CHASE

"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.

(beat)

Look, I've been letting you get

away with a lot these past few

weeks, but I'm not going to stand

for crap like this. I don't care

if it's Halloween... it's a school

night, and if you do this again...

GEOFF

(cutting him off)

I'm really tired, Dad... can I just

go to sleep?

CHASE

(sighing)

Go on... we'll talk about this in

the morning.

GUS (O.S.)

Drew!

GUS (O.S.)

Drew, buddy. I lost my keys.

DREW

(scared shitless)

Gus?

DREW

H-how'd you get in?

GUS

Found 'em.

GUS

I'm makin' a mess of your mother's

kitchen floor...

(beat)

I need a shower...

AMANDA

Gus, hon. I'm sorry about

tonight. You coming to bed?

AMANDA

God, you're ice cold...

(turning)

...and you smell! Lord, what did

you get yourself into?

AMANDA

My God, Gus, what happened?

AMANDA

Gus... stop it! What's wrong with

you?!

AMANDA

Gus!!!

GEOFF

Well?

DREW

Picture this... Gus comes down to

breakfast and he doesn't say a

word. He even kind of smiles,

like he forgot he hates me. And

then you know what he does? He

serves me an extra helping of

pancakes...

(beat)

I asked him if I was still

grounded... "no." I asked him if

you could spend the night, and he

nods. It's like we're a family.

A real family.

DREW

It's weird...

GEOFF

What do you mean?

DREW

It's like he's not Gus anymore.

He's different. You know, like

Zowie...

MESSAGE MACHINE

...Doctor Matthews, this is

Elliot Rudman at the university.

I've looked over the blood

specimen you sent us on canine

Zowie...

VOICE (O.S.)

Knock, Knock, Doc.

MOTHER

(quiet whisper)

We saw your sign. Are there any

kitties left?

CHASE

Take your pick. They're in the

boarding area. You can go on

back.

CHASE

Elliot, it's Chase...

CHASE

I didn't get that...

RUDMAN

...I said next time it might help

if you took the blood sample while

the animal was still alive...

CHASE

What?

RUDMAN

I don't know what you expected to

find, Matthews. There's nothing

wrong with the antigens, nothing

to indicate an unusual death...

CHASE

Wait, there must be some mix-up.

He was... the dog is alive.

RUDMAN

Not this dog. There wasn't enough

oxygen in those red cells to pump

life into a flea.

RUDMAN

You took over for Doctor Yolander?

CHASE

Yes... why?

RUDMAN

Because the last person that sent

me blood from a dead animal was

Yolander...

TODDLER

Where are the kitties?

CHASE

(into the phone)

Look, this is ridiculous...

CHASE

Jesus...

CLYDE

Hey!

DREW

Saved by the bell...

GEOFF

Can I sleep over at Drew's

tonight?

CHASE

Yeah... that's fine...

(beat)

Listen, Drew, I got the tests back

on Zowie. He's not well. Don't

ask me how, but he got out this

afternoon...

CHASE

If he finds his way home, call me,

no matter what the hour, okay? And

don't try to approach him.

Whatever he's got might be

infectious. Understand?

CHASE

Can I have the address for Quentin

Yolander?

YOLANDER

You'd be so much more interesting

with blue eyes...

YOLANDER

I'm immortalizing a poodle. State

your business!

CHASE (O.S.)

Doctor Yolander. This is Chase

Matthews. I've moved into your

offices in Ludlow...

CHASE (O.S.)

(continuing)

...I sent a blood sample out for

analysis. They tell me I sent

them the blood of a dead animal...

CHASE (O.S.)

...a dog...

YOLANDER

(glaring)

Why are you bothering me about

this? Can't you leave it be?

CHASE

I... um...

CHASE

(momentarily thrown)

...the pathologist... he said that

you had reported a similar

incident... with a cat...

YOLANDER

The Creed cat, that's right.

Bastard's name was "Church".

(grins)

Let me guess. Your dog's tissue

isn't healing, pupils aren't

dilating... maybe you can't find a

heartbeat?

CHASE

Exactly! I thought it might be

some sort of blood condition...

immune deficiency or...

YOLANDER

There's no "blood condition." The

dog isn't sick, it's dead.

(drawing closer)

And so was Creed's cat. And so

was his wife the night she was

killed for the second time...

YOLANDER

(menacing)

You want some advice, friend? You

get in your car, you pick up your

family... and you get the hell out

of that town.

CHASE

Well... uh... thanks...

DREW

I guess we're having rabbit for

dinner.

AMANDA

God damnit, Gus! This isn't

funny!

GEOFF

What was that all about? You

think he's trying to scare us?

DREW

I don't know but I'm not taking

any chances...

RENEE

Chase. I miss you so much...

CHASE

(dry-mouthed)

Renee...

CHASE

Oh God...

RENEE

(a whisper)

I can come back, Chase...

CHASE

No... Too heavy.

CHASE

...can't breathe... I can't...

MARJORIE

I didn't mean to... I was going to

empty the hamper...

CHASE

It's okay.

MARJORIE

What happened to you?

CHASE

I had a little run-in with Zowie.

MARJORIE

You sure did...

MARJORIE

Here, let me do that...

MARJORIE

I hope he doesn't have rabies.

CHASE

He doesn't. I don't know what he

has, but I'm hoping to God it's

not infectious...

CHASE

Marjorie... what do you know about

the Creed murders?

MARJORIE

Did you ever play that game where

you pass a story down a row of

people and see how screwed up it

gets by the time it's done?

People say Louis Creed's son came

back from the dead and it drove

him crazy...

(she rolls her eyes)

He killed his wife and himself,

and that's the end of story.

Anything else belongs in the

National Enquirer.

MARJORIE

Sorry. Now tell me what that has

to do with Zowie?

CHASE

I wish I knew.

LIBRARIAN

What are you looking for, Hon.

CHASE

Do you have anything on the Creed

murders? I can't find the

microfilm from that period...

LIBRARIAN

We don't keep anything on file

from that far back.

CHASE

But you've got files from the

previous years...

LIBRARIAN

We have nothing on the Creed

murders, sir. Can I get you

something else?

GEOFF

Do you think everyone that came

back would be like Gus?

DREW

I don't know...

(thinking)

...maybe it depends on what you

were like before you...

GEOFF

(finishing)

Dies?

DREW

I gotta go back and do my

chores...

GEOFF

Go later...

DREW

I can't. Gus'd kill me if I

showed up late.

DREW

See you at school Monday?

DREW

You ever think about running away?

GEOFF

All the time.

DREW

(calling back)

See ya!

CLYDE

Well look who's here!

CLYDE

Oops!

CLYDE

Guess your Dad's not here to save

you now, is he?

CLYDE

You ever seen a tire take off a

nose?

CLYDE

Neither have I.

CLYDE

Might even kill ya. Wheel might

chew right into your brains. You

could visit your mom.

CLYDE

(startled)

Jesus Christ, Gus!

GUS

Go home.

GUS

I said... GO HOME!!

CLYDE

Come on, Gus, I was just fucking

with him...

(nervous laughter)

What're you gonna do? Give me a

ticket? I mean, shit, Gus...

CLYDE

You can't lay a finger on me...

CLYDE

Gus... what are you doing?

GUS

I'm just fucking with you...

CLYDE

(wailing)

Stop it, man! Stop it!!!

GUS

(dead-pan)

Whoops.

DREW

Oh man...

GUS (V.O.)

(mocking)

This is the Police, come out of

the house with your hands up!

DREW

(horrified)

No, Zowie! It's me!

DREW

Stay back!

GUS

Forget something, Drew buddy?

GUS

(crazed)

You have the right to remain

silent...

GUS

(continuing)

...while I bash your fucking head

in!

GUS

You have the right to a lawyer,

but you won't need one...

GUS

...cause you'll be dead!

GUS (O.S.)

Do you understand these rights,

Drew buddy?!

GUS (O.S.)

...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING

STUPID?!

DREW

Gus killed Clyde, Mom! He's

trying to kill me!

GUS

Drew, buddy! Daddy's not done

yet!

DREW

Go Mom! Go!!!

DREW

Mom!!!

NEWSCASTER

... Friends and neighbors came to

pay respects for Drew and Amanda

Gilbert, who died in a head-on

collision Saturday...

MARJORIE

Those poor people. I saw Gus this

morning... he looked terrible.

CHASE

Geoff, dinner's ready!

(after no reply)

Geoff?!

GEOFF (O.S.)

I'm not hungry.

NEWSCASTER

...in other news, the

disappearance of a Ludlow youth

remains a mystery. Clyde Parker

was last seen on Saturday

afternoon. His motorcycle was

found off Highway 62...

CHASE

Geoff... what are you doing?

GEOFF

I'm getting things ready for Mom.

CHASE

(gently)

Mom is dead, Geoff. You know

that...

GEOFF

She doesn't have to be.

CHASE

What are you talking about?

GEOFF

I can bring her back. The same

way Drew and me brought Zowie

back...

CHASE

Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie

didn't die.

GEOFF

He did. We buried him.

(intense)

There's a place out in the

woods... if you bury something

there, it comes back alive.

GEOFF

We tried it on Zowie first. And

then we did it again, when Zowie

killed Gus. Drew didn't want Gus

to be dead, so we brought him

back, too...

MARJORIE (O.S.)

(outside the attic

door)

Doctor Matthews, you've got a

call. It's the caretaker at the

funeral home. Something about

your wife's grave...

CHASE

Look, Geoff. Just... just relax,

okay. I'm going to take this call

and I'll be right back. Okay?

CHASE

What?! Christ, I'll be right

there...

CHASE

(hurried)

Marjorie, I need you to stay late.

Geoff is really upset and I have

to take care of this. Don't let

him leave the house, alright?

RENEE

(a whisper)

I need you, Geoff...

CARETAKER

...sorry to disturb you, Doctor

Matthews, but I thought you'd want

to come have a look for yourself.

It's the damndest thing...

CHASE

Jesus...

(uncomprehending)

Gus did this?!

CARETAKER

(nodding)

He stuck around after the funeral.

Told me he had an order to exhume

your wife. I didn't think much of

it until I saw him drag the body

out of the coffin...

(shakes his head)

He put your wife in his truck and

drove off right through Amanda and

Drew's headstones...

CARETAKER

I swear, nothing this weird has

happened since Louis Creed dug up

his boy...

(beat)

You want me to notify the

authorities?

CHASE

Doctor Yolander, this is Chase

Matthews, we spoke the other

day...

YOLANDER'S VOICE

(bitter)

You didn't leave town, did you.

YOLANDER

You sorry bastard. You stayed. I

have nothing more to say to you,

Matthews...

CHASE'S VOICE

(desperate)

Look, just tell me one thing. Did

I treat an animal that had been

brought back to life? Did I?!

YOLANDER

What do you think?

YOLANDER (V.O.)

Believe what you saw, Matthews.

The dog was dead.

CHASE

My God...

(mounting horror)

...how is that possible? You have

to help me, Doctor Yolander. I

don't know what I'm dealing with

here! They've dug up my wife...

YOLANDER'S VOICE

(cutting him off)

I'm retired from my practice,

Matthews. It's your practice now,

and it's your problem.

(beat)

God help you...

CHASE

(screaming)

Wait! Don't hang up!

CHASE

Shit!

GUS

You bury your own, Geoff.

MARJORIE

Geoff?

MARJORIE

Geoff? You okay up there?

CHASE

Jesus...

CHASE

Gus, what are you doing?!

GUS

(dead-pan)

I was building a doggy door.

CHASE

God damn it Gus, you dug up my

wife! What the fuck is going on

around here?!

GUS

(grins)

A little drilling. A little

killing.

CHASE

Holy shit!

GUS

God I hate when that happens...

GUS

You got a permit for that?

GUS

Didn't think so.

GUS

(maniacal)

No brain, no pain, Chase. Think

about it...

GUS

(insane)

Just remember, Chase... I had Renee

first... and now I'm gonna have her

last...

CHASE

Geoff!

MARJORIE

Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on

me like that!

RENEE

(a whisper)

Did you really think you could be

like me?

RENEE

Such a young face... but you've got

potential...

RENEE

We'll do the eyes first. You

always start with the eyes...

GEOFF

Marjorie? You know you're not

supposed to be in the attic.

GEOFF

Mom...

RENEE

I came back for you, Geoff. We're

going to be together again.

CHASE

Marjorie?

RENEE

Hello, Chase.

CHASE

Oh my God...

RENEE

We can try again, Chase. We can

make it work this time.

CHASE

(shaking his head)

No...

RENEE

Don't you love me anymore, Chase?

CHASE

You're not Renee... Renee's dead...

(screaming)

Geoff! Get over here now!

RENEE

(looking at Chase)

Geoff, honey, why don't you go

downstairs. Your father and I

need a moment alone. Do it for

me?

RENEE

Geoff...

RENEE

I love you.

CLYDE

(grinning)

Hey, Junior. Wanna play?

CHASE

Geoff!

CLYDE

Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-

boo...

CLYDE

Now, where were we?

CLYDE

Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT

FUCKING COMES!!!

CLYDE

Eat it, ass-hole...

GEOFF

EAT THIS!!!

RENEE (O.S.)

Don't leave me again, Geoff!

RENEE

Don't leave me alone!

RENEE

NO, GEOFF! NO!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

GEOFF

All set?

CHASE

All set.

CHASE (V.O.)

So where're we going?

GEOFF

Anywhere but here.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE TO BLACK.
