HELLRAISER II : HELLBOUND

Screenplay by Peter Atkins

Original Story by Clive Barker

2nd. Draft

November 1, 1987

PINHEAD

(echoed & slow)

Kirsty, come to daddy

RONSON

(off camera)

Ah, you're awake. Good.

RONSON

Tell you what - we'll make a

deal. I'll tell you what I

know, then you tell me what

you know.  O.K.?

RONSON

O.K.?

KIRSTY

Where am I?

RONSON

You're in the Malahide Institute.

It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey,

don't feel judged - it was just

the nearest place to bring you.

Remember? You and your boyfriend... ?

KIRSTY

Steve...

RONSON

Don't worry. He's O.K.  We sent him

home hours ago.  Jeez, what a story.

RONSON

What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust?

Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?

KIRSTY

What are you talking about?  Who

are you?

RONSON

Oh, excuse me...

RONSON

Ronson.  Homicide.  I'm this

district's slash and dash expert.

Made a career of the nasty ones.

That's why I was at your

Dad's house.  Jesus, what a mess.

KIRSTY (to herself)

Daddy...

CORTEZ

Jesus...

CORTEZ

Oh. shit...

RONSON

We got two missing people

and a house full of corpses.

RONSON

Talk to me.

KIRSTY

I thought Steve had talked

to you?

RONSON

Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't

convey my hesitation to take his

story at face-value. No, YOU

talk to me. But - do me a favor? -

none of this DEMONS crap.

KIRSTY

He talked about Demons, huh?

RONSON

Yeah.

KIRSTY

It's true. All of it. It's all true.

RONSON

Ronson.

KUCICH

Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one,

though it suffered a little...

KUCICH

...er, accidental damage in discovery.

Anyway, just about the only portable

evidence we've got here - apart from

human remains - is the mattress. Looks

like someone was messed up real bad

on it.

KUCICH

(off-camera)

Can we send it downtown?

RONSON

What the hell are you asking me

for?  Tag it.  Move it.

KIRSTY (to herself)

The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.

OFFICER

Shit!

MALAHIDE

We can bring them back properly

more often than scientific orthodoxy

dictates, ladies and gentlemen.  And

the knife, far from the enemy of

of analysis, is often its greatest

ally in solving the puzzles of

psychosis. Analysis isolates and

massages. Surgery pinpoints and

corrects. ... though you've got to

know what you're doing, of course...

MALAHIDE

Some things are obvious. Here,

for example, ...

MALAHIDE

...are the optical motor nerve

control centers.

MALAHIDE

Now. This case. A deeply-buried

psychosis severe enough to produce

frighteningly frequent hysteria and

aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so.

Analysis isolates. The knife

exposes. Medication controls.

MALAHIDE

And then, ladies and gentlemen, we

REBUILD. With all the care and

knowledge that our years of training

have given us ...

MALAHIDE

... WE BRING THEM BACK.

INTERCOM

Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is

awake, and appears very distressed.

MALAHIDE

My part in this is over.  You

may tidy up for me.  Kyle, you

come with me.

RONSON

Easy, easy.  Whatever happened,

whatever you saw, it's not here

now.

KIRSTY

I saw it...him.  But I got away.

And I took the box.  And I solved

it.  And they came.

RONSON

Who?

KIRSTY

The Cenobites.

KIRSTY

The Demons.

MALAHIDE

Sorry.  Must get that door

fixed.  Detective Ronson?

MALAHIDE

I am Doctor Malahide.

MALAHIDE

My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And

this must be Kirsty?

MALAHIDE

I've read the boy's statement.

Quite the adventure they

believe they had. I'd like to talk

to her alone. Do you think ... ?

RONSON

Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think

she's more your territory than

mine.  Shame.

RONSON

Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going

to look after you now.  Maybe we

could talk some more tomorrow.

KIRSTY

Wait!  The mattress.  You've got

to destroy it.  She DIED on it,

you see.  The mattress.  It's

haunted now.  She can come back...

like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK.

"you see what I mean" expression, and leaves the room.

KIRSTY (to herself)

The mattress ...

KYLE

Uh...excuse me a moment.

MALAHIDE

Detective. I'll be able to help

this girl. But I need your assistance ...

KYLE

So...You're Kirsty, huh?

KIRSTY

You a doctor, too?

KYLE

Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle

Macrae. Call me Kyle.

KIRSTY

Hi, Kyle.

MALAHIDE

Now, Kirsty...

KIRSTY

The cop. He didn't believe me.

MALAHIDE

I suspect not. But that

doesn't necessarily mean

you're wrong, does it?

KIRSTY

Do you believe me?

MALAHIDE

Well, I don't know yet.

However, you're not lying.

YOU believe this is the truth.

KIRSTY

It IS the truth.

MALAHIDE

Well?

INTERN

Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's

Tiffany. She's escaped ... again.

MALAHIDE

Very Well.

KIRSTY

I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will

come back with something to

help you sleep. We shall speak

tomorrow.

1st INTERN

Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it.

MALAHIDE

Tiffany. Come.

KYLE

Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if

anyone should know not to do that,

it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.?

KYLE

Sad, huh? She's been here

six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

KIRSTY

What's the matter with her?

KYLE

Almost complete withdrawal. She

hasn't said a word for nearly

two years.

KIRSTY

God, that's terrible.

KYLE

Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her

doing these jig-saws and things,

though. Says it's helping to

bring her out.

KYLE

Anyway, let's concentrate on

you for a moment. Wanna suck

on this for me?

KIRSTY

Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you

always come on to the mentally

ill?

KYLE

Shit. Sorry. Here's the

pills. Red face. Door. Bye.

KIRSTY

Jesus, I'm glad I'm not paying

for this place.

KIRSTY

(under her breath)

Daddy...

MALAHIDE

(off-camera)

And how are we feeling today...?

MALAHIDE

Better? Good.

W/CHAIR PATIENT

105 years and he still doesn't

know my name.

BROWNING

(muttering)

Get them off me. Get them off me.

KIRSTY

I...I had a visitor.

KYLE

What?

KIRSTY

Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's

...it's. I don't know how to

help! I have to save him and I

don't know how to help!

KYLE

(Carefully)

Kirsty, I'm sorry...  don't

understand. I...

KIRSTY

I know. No-one can. But I have to save

him. Where's the other doctor? He said

He'd listen. He promised.

KYLE

Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll

fetch him. You take it easy.

I'm sure he can help.

KIRSTY

Help. No, no-one can help. I

just want someone to listen

or I WILL go crazy.

KYLE

If anyone can help, HE can.

KIRSTY

Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell?

MALAHIDE

(off-camera & gradually fading up)

Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor

Malahide. You've spoken to

Ronson? Yes ... That's right.

The mattress ... No, I'll meet

you by the side entrance. No, no,

my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that

clear. The house, NOT the hospital.

... Yes ... Fine, and thank you.

KYLE

Doctor Malahide ... ?

KIRSTY

It must have been going on

forever...

MALAHIDE

Kirsty...?

KIRSTY

But the part I know about,

That must have started with

my Uncle Frank...

MALAHIDE

Then let us speak of it ...

LYONS 6/2/'72 4

NEW YORK 12/3/'81 5

KYLE

Jesus Christ. Jee-sus-kerr-ist!

KYLE

Oh, shit.

BROWNING

Get them off me. Get. Them.

Off. Me.

MALAHIDE

Mr. Browning. Please, lie down.

MALAHIDE

Here. This will help.

KYLE

(mimed)

Jesus Christ!

JULIA

Help me.

JULIA

Help Me.

JULIA

Don't be embarrassed. You're

my friend.

JULIA

Well?

KIRSTY

Shit, Kyle. This is getting to

be a habit. What is it, some

kind of shock-therapy?

KIRSTY

Oh, Jesus. What is it?

KYLE

It's all true.

JULIA

I'm cold.

JULIA

Well?

MALAHIDE

Yes... Yes. You look...

JULIA

Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?

MALAHIDE

No. You look...

JULIA

Yes, I still like WINE ...

JULIA

... and more.

JULIA

Close it.

MALAHIDE

It's a beautiful dress...

JULIA

I know.

MALAHIDE

There...

MALAHIDE

Well?

JULIA

Well?

JULIA

(almost coyly)

Now all we need is a skin.

KIRSTY

Yeah?

KYLE

You O.K.?

KYLE

Kirsty? You 0. K.?

KIRSTY

No bad dreams.

KYLE

So you slept O.K.?

KIRSTY

As much as that bed of

nails allowed.

KYLE

Well, the sofa isn't often used

for sleeping on...

KIRSTY

Oh yeah? On your own a lot,

Huh?

KYLE

Like the robe?

KYLE

I think I need to talk. About

what I saw.

KIRSTY

You thought I was crazy, didn't

you?

KYLE

Jesus, yes! What do you expect.

I mean, God, I still do! It's

just that now I'm crazy too.

KIRSTY

And you're sure it was a woman?

KYLE

God, I wish I could say no.

This is going to do terrible

things to my attitude, you know.

KIRSTY

Don't worry about it. Your

attitude sucks anyway.

KYLE

Hey, so for it. Don't let pity

stop you. I'm down. Nail me.

KIRSTY

What can I do? How can I

save him?

KIRSTY

The box. I need the box.

KYLE

The box? Like in your story?

Like in his house?

KIRSTY

(sharply)

What?

KYLE

The Boxes. In the House. I

told you.

KIRSTY

What do you mean?

KYLE

The boxes! I TOLD you.

KIRSTY

You DIDN'T tell me. Do you

mean Malahide's got...

KYLE

Yeah. The things you were

talking about.

KIRSTY

I'm going.

KYLE

Wait a minute. What do you mean,

'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?

KIRSTY

Get out of the way.

KYLE

Are you crazy?

KIRSTY

I don't know, Kyle. You're the

fucking expert. Now get out of

the way!

KYLE

WHY?

KIRSTY

(shouting)

Because I'm going to get my father!

KIRSTY

I'm going to get my father.

KYLE

Two seconds. Just two seconds.

Don't move.

KYLE

O.K. Let's go.

KIRSTY

Kyle, you don't have...

KYLE

I KNOW I don't have to. It's

just my time of the month to be a

complete fucking idiot. O.K.?

KYLE

Wait! The .. thing ...

I want to be sure it's

not here.

JULIA

Sssh. I think it's still here.

KYLE

What? The...The thing?

JULIA

Yes. I had to stop you going in

there because I knew you'd cry

out. Any normal person would.

It ...It's just TERRIBLE.

KYLE

Is it in there?

JULIA

No. Not now.

JULIA

Was I right? Is it terrible?

KYLE

Yes. Yes, it's terrible.

JULIA

Oh. You look awful.  You poor

boy. Come here...

JULIA

...Come to Mother ...

JULIA

What's your name?

KYLE

Kyle...

JULIA

I'm JULIA.

JULIA

Thank you, Kyle.

KIRSTY

(to herself)

Kyle...?

KIRSTY

(slightly louder)

Kyle?

JULIA

Kirsty! How nice of

you to drop in.

JULIA

You have surprisingly good taste in men.

KIRSTY

Kyle! No! I'll kill you,

you...

JULIA

Oh, you can try it, you

little bitch. I'd love you

to try it. But I'm not just

the woman I was.

KIRSTY

What, you mean you're something

more than a whore with a vicious

streak?

JULIA

I mean I'm something more than

human, you little shit!

JULIA

Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell

you, did they? I'm afraid

they've changed the rules of

the fairy tale; I'm no longer

just the wicked step-mother.

JULIA

Now I'm the Evil Queen.

JULIA

So come on; Take your best

shot, Snow White.

MALAHIDE

(off-camera)

Julia!

TIME CUT

JULIA

You're sure this is what you

want?

MALAHIDE

It's what I've ALWAYS

wanted. A view of ...

beyond.

MALAHIDE

You were almost enough, Julia

but...I have to see. I have to

KNOW.

JULIA

Oh, I quite understand.

MALAHIDE

She's done it.

JULIA

She certainly has.

MALAHIDE

It's coming.

JULIA

It certainly is.

PINHEAD

Wait.

PINHEAD

No.

CENOBITE

No?

PINHEAD

No.

PINHEAD

It is not HANDS that call us...

PINHEAD

... It is DESIRE.

KIRSTY

Oh, shit.

KIRSTY

NO!

KIRSTY

Wait. Wait.

KIRSTY

Hey, remember me? From the

hospital? I was in the next room?

KIRSTY

You don't want to go down

there. You REALLY don't

want to go down there.

KIRSTY

Jesus Christ.

KIRSTY

Tiffany. Wait!

KIRSTY

Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't

Trust it!

JULIA

Do be careful.

KIRSTY

Mommy...

KIRSTY

Nooooo!

PINHEAD

Ah, Kirsty. And we thought

we'd lost you.

FEMALE CENOBITE

So sweet of you to come back.

PINHEAD

How can it send us back, child?

We're already here. And so are you.

KIRSTY

No! You... You can't! It wasn't

me...I didn't do it! I didn't

open the box!

FEMALE CENOBITE

Didn't open the box. And what was it

last time? Didn't know what the box

was. And yet we DO keep finding each

other, don't we?

PINHEAD

Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so

reluctant to admit it.

FEMALE CENOBITE

Perhaps you're teasing us. Are

you teasing us?

KIRSTY

But I didn't open it! I didn't!

PINHEAD

Then why are you here?

KIRSTY

I've come for my father!

PINHEAD

But he's in his own Hell, child

And quite unreachable.

KIRSTY

I don't believe you!

PINHEAD

But it's true, He is his own Hell.

Just as you are in yours.

KIRSTY

And what about you?

PINHEAD

It's different for us.

FEMALE CENOBITE

We've always been here.

PINHEAD

We have no more surprises.

PINHEAD

But, please; feel free.

Explore. We'll always

be here...

PINHEAD

... we have Eternity to

know your flesh!

JULIA

Come. I have such sights to show you.

KIRSTY

Do you see? You were RIGHT.

This IS a puzzle, too. But

WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle.

KIRSTY

Yeah?

KIRSTY

Yeah?

KIRSTY

Yeah!

MALAHIDE

Enough. God, that's enough. We

HAVE to go back.

JULIA

Go back? What an earth makes

you think we can go back?

MALAHIDE

I want to go back!

JULIA

Sorry, friend. No day trips to

Hell. Here you are. Here you

stay. And forward the only way

to go.

VOICE

Kirsty!

KIRSTY

(Very Tentatively)

Daddy...?

Only a low moan comes from behind the door.

KIRSTY

Tiffany. Wait here. If I'm

not back real soon - get

out. Get home.

KIRSTY

daddy...

KIRSTY

Daddy. It's Kirsty...

KIRSTY

Oh God.

VOICE

No. Over here. Behind the

screen.

KIRSTY

Daddy... ?

FRANK

That's it, baby. Come to

Daddy.

KIRSTY

NO!

FRANK

What's the matter, Kirsty?

It's only Frank. It's only

Uncle Frank.

KIRSTY

I should have known! I should've

known he wouldn't be here! This

place is only for filth like you!

FRANK

Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone

to heaven, eh?

KIRSTY

Yes!

FRANK

Shit. Bull. Shit

FRANK

See? He's here. You should learn

to believe your Uncle Frank.

KIRSTY

No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It

SHOULD'VE been a trick!

FRANK

'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here.

With me. We're the same. Brothers.

Equal and opposite. Pure appetite.

Pure banality. Too much feeling.

None at all.

KIRSTY

You're full of shit, Frank Cotton.

My Dad wasn't like that at all.

He could feel. He could love. He

loved ME.

KIRSTY

He...he loved me.

FRANK

Don't waste your tears. Look

at him!

KIRSTY

He loved me, you bastard! He

Loved me, he loved my mother.

He even loved that bitch you

betrayed him with!

FRANK

Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to

see me recently. That's why

it's so nice to have you

here, baby. Daddy's little girl.

So pretty when she's upset. Come

to Daddy,

FRANK

Now don't be naughty, Kirsty. Or

I'll have to punish you first.

Perhaps you'd like that. Would

you like that?

KIRSTY

Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!

FRANK

I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.

LARRY

Get your fucking hands off

my daughter, you bastard!

MALAHIDE

No! No! Julia! Help me!

JULIA

But you WANTED this. You wanted

to SEE. You wanted to KNOW. And

here it is. The heart of Hell.

Leviathan.

JULIA

Why do you think I was allowed

to go back? For YOU? No, it

wanted souls. And I brought you.

And you wanted to KNOW. Now you're

both happy.

JULIA

Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real.

FRANK

How convenient.

LARRY

Stay there, baby. Don't

come in.

FRANK

Yes. Stay there. I'll be with

you in a minute.

JULIA

Frank...

JULIA

Well, well. All my family

together again. How very

sweet.

FRANK

(delighted/flattered)

Julia.

JULIA

(Flatly)

Frank.

FRANK

I knew you'd come.

JULIA

You knew?

FRANK

Yes. You're a girl who

remembers her promises.

JULIA

Oh, I do. I do.

FRANK

And I know how much I mean

to you. Come here.

FRANK

Come here. Kiss me. And

then...

FRANK

... we'll have a real family

re-union.

LARRY

Jesus Christ, FRANK. I don't

believe you. You don't know

her at all do you? You still

think you're in charge.

FRANK

Of course I am. She BELONGS

to me.

KIRSTY

For God's sake! He KILLED you!

FRANK

She's forgiven me that. Haven't

you?

JULIA

Do you really need to ask?

FRANK

Show them.

JULIA glances at the knives. FRANK shrugs.

FRANK

Just a small inconvenience, babe.

LARRY

Jesus!  Out.  Out!

LARRY

Wait a minute.  Why are we

following her? Who is this?

KIRSTY

This is Tiffany

KIRSTY

... She's good at puzzles.

LARRY

Fine.

JULIA

Nothing personal, babe.

KIRSTY

Oh. My. God.

KIRSTY

Tiffany, listen.  You've solved

it. But we've got to solve it

the OTHER way.  See?  See?

We've got to get out.

LARRY

Come on!

KIRSTY

Please!  Tiffany, Please!

Get us out!  Take us home,

please!

KIRSTY

Malahide ...

KIRSTY

Jesus Christ!  Of course ...

MALAHIDE

And to think I hesitated ...

MALAHIDE

Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new

world of puzzles for you to enjoy ...

MALAHIDE

A whole new world of pleasures

for you to endure.

LARRY

No.  I've had enough of this shit.

Who the hell are you?

KIRSTY

It's ...

LARRY

Never mind.  Never mind.

LARRY

Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

LARRY

O.K.  You've done it before.  You

can do it again.  GET US OUT OF

HERE!

KIRSTY

No. Come on. We have to get

out of here.

JULIA

Oh, poor Larry.  You never

could hold on to anything

for very long, could you?

JULIA

NOOOOOOOOOO!

KIRSTY

My God, it's her room!

LARRY

Let's go!

KIRSTY

No. No, there's something

wrong...

LARRY

Jesus. O.K. No more arguments.

Just RUN!

LARRY

Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!!

KIRSTY

Tiffany ... ?

KIRSTY

But these were ... Daddy?

KIRSTY

These flowers. I saw them just...

KIRSTY

...the day ...before... yesterday

Daddy? Daddy!

KIRSTY

Daddy!

KIRSTY

Get help.

KIRSTY

Pass me a pillow.

KIRSTY

What do you do? I just don't

know what to do.

INTERN

Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.

KIRSTY

Is he going to be 0.K.?

INTERN

We just can't say.

O.R.'s on standby. They'll

do what they can.

KIRSTY

But it's bad?

INTERN

(gently but flatly)

Yeah. It's bad.

INTERN

Wait out here. A doctor

will talk to you when

we know more.

KIRSTY

Is he going to be all right?

1st GOWNED FIGURE

(matter of factly)

No. He's not going to be

all right.

KIRSTY

Wh...

1st GOWNED FIGURE

No. He's going to die. He's got

a ruptured aorta. He's going to

die in agony.

KIRSTY

Oh, Fuck.

KIRSTY

C'mon. C'MON!

KIRSTY

COME ON!!

KIRSTY

Faster, you bastard, faster!

KIRSTY

Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm

sorry. I didn't mean it.

KIRSTY

It's 0.K. They can't beat an

elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K.

KIRSTY

It'll be O.K.

KIRSTY

This way. Short cut.

KIRSTY

Oh, Christ. This isn't just

personal anymore.

MALAHIDE

The Doctor is in!

TIFFANY

Oh, shit.

MALAHIDE

I recommend amputation.

PINHEAD

Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.

FEMALE CENOBITE

No more delays, Kirsty. No more

teasing. Time to play.

PINHEAD

Time to play.

KIRSTY

Wait!

PINHEAD

No more deals, Kirsty. It's

your flesh we want to experience,

not your skill at bargaining.

KIRSTY

No deals! Just information.

Information. Free of charge.

No strings. Just information.

PINHEAD

Go on. But trick us again,

child, and your suffering will

be legendary even in Hell.

PINHEAD

What is this? Someone else

you think escaped us, like

Frank?

KIRSTY

No, No, this one didn't escape.

You told me you'd always been

in Hell. You were wrong. Look

at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.

PINHEAD

Nonsense, I...

KIRSTY

It's you! You HAVEN'T always

been as you are. You were

HUMAN. Remember. Remember

all your confusions. Think!

FEMALE CENOBITE

Enough!

PINHEAD

Wait!

PINHEAD

I...remember.

KIRSTY

You were ALL human!

MALAHIDE

Tiffany. Come.

MALAHIDE

Tiffany. Come.

KIRSTY

Leave her alone, you asshole!

MALAHIDE

Oh,good. A fight.

PATIENT

So what, girls? It's O.K.

for an ego-trip but it

doesn't got the job done.

TIFFANY

I have to go back. Or it'll

never stop.

KIRSTY

(Confused)

What are you talking...

TIFFANY

(to herself)

I've got to finish it.

KIRSTY

Finish what?

KIRSTY

Tiffany! Wait!

KIRSTY

Oh, gross.

KIRSTY

What are you doing? What are WE doing?

TIFFANY

I can't do it here. I have to

go to it.

TIFFANY

I'm scared.

KIRSTY

No. Don't let it. You've

come this far.

MALAHIDE

Ah, girls. And how are we

feeling today?

MALAHIDE

You have your whole lives

behind you now.

KIRSTY

Tiffany! No!

MALAHIDE

Surgery is open, Tiffany.

What was today's agenda?

MALAHIDE

Ah, yes. Evisceration.

JULIA

Doctor. I've missed you.

MALAHIDE

I knew you'd come back.

JULIA

I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

JULIA

Do it, Tiffany! Do it!

JULIA

Trust me.

KIRSTY

So. What're you going to do?

Open up a games-shop somewhere?

Sell jigsaw puzzles?

TIFFANY

Oh, yeah.

KIRSTY

Well ... G'bye.

TIFFANY

It's been Hell.

WORKMAN

So whose was all this shit?

2nd. WORKMAN

Not our problem...

2nd. WORKMAN

... Gimme a hand with this.

JULIA

I'm Julia. Love me.
