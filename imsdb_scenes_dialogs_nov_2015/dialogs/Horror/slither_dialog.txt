STARLA

When Darwin said 'fittest,' he

didn't necessarily mean the

strongest or the most intelligent,

or any one trait -- he merely meant

those organisms most well-suited

to their environment.

STARLA

We humans think we're more fit,

more evolved, because we're smarter.

But we're neophytes. We've been

around two million years, give or

take. The cockroach has been here

for 350 million. You tell me who's

the more successful species.

STARLA

Will.

WILL

How's all this go with how the

Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?

STARLA

We'll tackle that tomorrow...

Everyone bring your boxing gloves.

2.

JACK

Get the fuck out of the way,

cocksucker!

MOTHER

Mornin', Mayor.

KYLIE

Prolly go find it later, sell it

on eBay.

3.

GRANT

Just a tremor, boys.

TREVOR

Did ya' feel that?!

TREVOR

I always get afraid when that

happens, 'cause what if the ground

cracks open and you fall inside?

It's so hot in there you get all

burnt to nothin' like that --

(snaps)

Happened to my uncle Barry.

WALLY

Who told you that story, Trevor?

TREVOR

My aunt.

4.

BILL

Your uncle Barry left her for a

stripper up in Winnsboro.

SHELBY

Chief! We got a 'mergency over at

the diner!

WAITRESS

Back there, Bill!

WAITRESS

She slipped in, was eating trash.

We seen it on TV, how they kill

ya'--

BILL

Right.

WAITRESS

So we thought we best call in.

BILL

Come on now, honey, door's this

way.

MARGARET

It's open season. Let's shoot

her.

BILL

She's just scared, Margaret.

5.

WALLY

Also, Bill likes to take a female

through the back door any chance

he gets.

BILL

She ain't a bull, Trevor!

MARGARET

Goddamn bambi-rat!

BILL

Get back.

BILL

It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's

gonna hurt you.

BILL

That's right. Just gonna pull

this cord out. It's gonna be all

right.

BILL

Hell, she took a phone. Now them

forest critters are gonna be calling

us all hours of the night.

6.

WALLY

Chief of police there? This a

squirrel. Bring me a bag of

peanuts, motherfucker!

SECRETARY

'Night, Mr. Grant.

GRANT

See ya', Ashley.

GRANT (O.S.)

So I get home today, phone's

ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.

GRANT

Callin' for you. What the hell?

I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit

outta line don't'cha think, a single

man callin' someone's wife?' At

night, nonetheless.

7.

STARLA

He's teaching environmental science,

Grant. Probably wants to borrow

my lesson plans from last semester.

GRANT

Oh yeah, that's what he wants to

borrow, this guy.

STARLA

It's just a work thing.

GRANT

Work thing hell, Starla. He just

wants to get in your pussy. Him

and most these other ones around

here. That's where their minds is

at, them sick fucks.

GRANT

I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're

lucky you got me. You're too damn

trusting. Without me to protect

you, you'd get kilt one of these

days.

GRANT (O.S.)

Sugarplum, you coming into bed?

STARLA

Just a second.

8.

STARLA

Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --

I'm not in the mood.

GRANT

Come on, baby, it's --

STARLA

I'm sorry.   I don't just have some

switch.

GRANT

Sure you do.

GRANT

Flip.

GRANT

Flip.

STARLA

That's disrespectful.

GRANT

When are you in the mood, exactly?

Seems to me that mood's as rare as

winnin' the Goddamn lotto.

STARLA

Where are you going?

GRANT

I'm just some big clown to you,

ain't I?

STARLA

That's not true -- Where are you-?

GRANT

Out.

9.

GRANT

Hit me again there, killer.

BARKEEP

Hey, Grant, how's it you come to

have the same last name as first?

GRANT

Parents thought it sounded pleasant,

I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?

BRENDA

Megan Halesy' little sister.

GRANT

Shit.   You're kidding me.

BRENDA

Nope.   Brenda!

GRANT

Hell, you were --

BRENDA

I was! And I'll tell you somethin',

Grant Grant. I's in love with

you.

BRENDA

My sister Megan, she's a big fat

cow. Was then, even more so now.

I'd be thinking, what'd you see in

her ain't in me?

GRANT

Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been

eleven.

10.

BRENDA

Hell, I was game!

GRANT

Who's the lucky fella?

BRENDA

Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn

half-Mexican.

GRANT

Already ain't.     Married a gal named --

BRENDA

Starla Covington. Don't be

ignorant. Everyone knows that.

Fucking prom queen.

GRANT

Yeah.

BRENDA

Where you goin'?

GRANT

Starla, she gets real worried 'bout

me I stay out too late. Loves me

too much, that one.

11.

GRANT

What the...?

GRANT

Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?

12.

GRANT

Ow!   Fuck!

MATCH CUT TO:

CAMPER

Over here!

CAMPER

Hey, man. You all right?...

Dude?... Oh shit.

CAMPER

I think he's d --

GRANT

It's taking... my... brain.

13.

CAMPER

Buddy?

CAMPER

You all right, man?

CAMPER

That might of been a stroke, buddy.

You better take it easy.

NEIGHBOR (O.S.)

Hey ya', Grant.

NEIGHBOR

What were ya', night-fishing again?

You catch anything?

GRANT

I caught a little somethin', yeah.

14.

GRANT

Hey there, sugarplum.

STARLA

Haven't heard this for a while.

STARLA

I never danced in a towel before.

GRANT

Wearing white, just like on our...

wedding day. I remember it.

GRANT

I'm sorry about last night. I get

a little insecure sometimes, want

to hold on too tight. It's just

'cause you're precious to me,

Starla.

(MORE)

15.

GRANT (CONT'D)

But I swear to God, baby, I'm

turning over a new Goddamn leaf.

Okay?

GRANT

I love you, sugarplum.

STARLA

Grant, what's that?

GRANT

Just a little bug bite is all.

FADE TO:

JANENE

What are you so smiley about, girl?

STARLA

Oh, nothin'.

16.

STARLA

Just, Grant and I had a nice

morning. It's been a while.

JANENE

Oh! You got that fresh-fucked

glow, don't you?

STARLA

Janene.

JANENE

You slut.

STARLA

Hush.

JANENE

No shame.   You're a married woman.

STARLA

He was... considerate. Maybe this

is the start of a real change in

Grant.

17.

GRANT

Meat.

GRANT

Meat.

BUTCHER

Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to

the Deer Cheer this weekend?

GRANT

Sure thing, killer.

BUTCHER

What can I do you for?

18.

GRANT

Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple

of these big ol' rib eyes.

BUTCHER

How many you need?

GRANT

Well... having us a little dinner

party... I'd say... eight. No,

no... fourteen...

GRANT

Hell, what am I holding back for?

Why don't you just give me

everything you got here?

BUTCHER

All the rib eyes?

GRANT

Yep. And while you're at it, get

me a few of them chicken wings...

some pork loins... and, ooo, what's

this here? Osso buco?...

GRANT

Meat.

19.

GRANT

You're meat.

GRANT

Welcome home.

STARLA

Grant? Why are there -- did you

put locks on the garage?

STARLA

You drilled into the driveway.

GRANT

Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got

so excited about... your present.

STARLA

My present?

GRANT

You're my princess, aren't you?

20.

STARLA

Okay.

GRANT

I got a super-special birthday

present for you this year. I

couldn't risk you finding it, so I

had to put them locks on the doors.

STARLA

All right... I have to clean up

before dinner.

GRANT

You're meat.

STARLA

What?

GRANT

Oh, nothin'.   Nothin'.   See you in

a sec.

21.

GRANT

Meat.

STARLA

Roscoe's gone?

BOY

You haven't seen him, have you?

STARLA

I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.

22.

FADE TO:

STARLA

Grant, are you almost ready?

GRANT

Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!

STARLA

What are you doing?

GRANT

You're pretty.

23.

GRANT

Who's that?

STARLA

It's just one of my students, Grant.

TREVOR

What's she see in that douchebag?

BILL

That's the mystery of the ages

there, Trev. Starla was seventeen

when they got engaged. He was,

like, in his thirties. No one

even knew they were goin' out till

she had that ring on her finger.

MARGARET

Ain't no mystery to it. She's

raised in them shanties off St.

Luc. Dirt-poor.

TREVOR

Gold-digger, huh?

BILL

Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.

JACK

Bill, you're Chief of police now.

(MORE)

24.

JACK (CONT'D)

Comes with some Goddamn

responsibility, like keeping your

people in line.

BILL

You're right, Jack.    Margaret,

you're fired.

STARLA

Janene!

JANENE

Hey, Grant.

GRANT

Why don't you two catch up? I'll

go see what the boys are doing.

STARLA

He's been strange the past couple

days.

25.

BRENDA (O.S.)

Hey there, handsome.

BRENDA

Must be fate, us meeting again

like this.

GRANT

Well, you might be right...

GRANT

You're lookin' awful pretty.

BRENDA

Shut up.

GRANT

Where's the old half-Mexican?

BRENDA

Took the kids to his Mom's for the

weekend.

BRENDA

Where you takin' me, you bad boy!

GRANT

Take off your shirt, doll.

GRANT

Guess it's hard to explain how

amazin' a human brain is to someone

who that's all they know.

26.

BRENDA

What?

GRANT

Stuff you can never imagine.

Feelings. Big thoughts. And love.

Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it

into somethin' more. So, go ahead

there, beautiful, and take off

your shirt.

GRANT

Nice.

BRENDA

Grant!?    What -- ?!

BRENDA

No, no, we --

27.

STARLA

Hey, Bill!

BILL

Don't worry. The lurker ain't

around. I checked.

STARLA

That's not funny.

BILL

Sorry.

STARLA

Whatcha' doin'?

BILL

Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm

too buff. Too much muscle mass.

BILL

What you up to?

STARLA

Just checking out the lights.

BILL

Pretty, ain't they?

STARLA

I don't know. I've seen them so

many times before. I guess any

spot gets boring after awhile.

BILL

Well that's only if you're in the

wrong spot.

28.

BILL

There's a place over there on the

bluffs. When the fog is just right,

like tonight, the lights of Main

look like a kaleidoscope.

STARLA

Oh, yeah?

BILL

Mm hm. But only a few folks know

how to get there. Wally. Rollo

Linkski coulda taken you, but

'course he got hit by that train.

Me.

STARLA

I'll get Wally to show me sometime

then.

Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill.

BILL

Oh, will you now?

STARLA                            GRANT (O.S.)

They turn to see Grant approaching.     He's a mess.   His

pants are streaked with mud.

STARLA

Grant, where'd you go?

BILL

Hey, Grant.

Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla.

GRANT

You ready, sugarplum?

Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths:

STARLA

Bye.

Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the

rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.

WALLY

Surprised you're able to lift a

mug after carrying that torch for

so long.

29.

BILL

Hey, Wally. Glad you're here.

There was something I wanted to

tell you...

WALLY

What?

BILL

Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.

FADE TO:

MARGARET

Sir, may I help -- ?

BRENDA'S HUSBAND

My wife, Brenda. I think something

has happened to her!

STARLA

Grant?

30.

STARLA

Damn fuse.

STARLA

Grant?

STARLA

Grant, where are y -- ?

STARLA

Grant. Oh my God. What happened

to your -- ?

GRANT

Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,

sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.

I had a reaction to a bee sting.

He gave me a prescription. Said I

should be fine, in a couple days.

GRANT

Don't look at me like that, baby.

Please? I'm gonna go get my...

prescription filled.

31.

STARLA

I'll get if for you.

GRANT

No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.

BRENDA

Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so

fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna

die.

GRANT

Brought you munchies.

GRANT

Been saving for a rainy day.

32.

BRENDA

Grant, I'm sorry if I did something

wrong! I think I gotta -- I think

I should go to a hospital!

WALLY

Grant around?

STARLA

No.   He went to the pharmacy.

WALLY

Pharmacy?

STARLA

He's got a... rash.

BILL

Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?

BILL

Maybe she's ever called the house,

or -- ?

33.

STARLA

No.   What...?

BILL

She disappeared Friday night. We

got reason to believe foul play

might be involved.

WALLY

Some kids found her necklace near

Tipper Creek, as well as what might

be her blood on a rock.

BILL

The problem, Starla, is, the last

person anyone saw her talking to

was Grant.

BILL

The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,

we also saw him that night, with

mud all over his slacks.

BILL

Have him call me right away, okay?

34.

SHERRY (O.S.)

You've reached Chief Pardy at the

Wheelsy Police Department. Please

leave a message and your call will

be returned as soon as possible.

STARLA

Bill, it's Starla!

STARLA

It's -- I think you better come

over right away -- I think Grant's

sick, he --

35.

GRANT

Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!

STARLA

Grant, no!

GRANT

I loved you.     I loved --

STARLA

Grant, you're sick!

GRANT

I wanted you by my side, but you --

I can't trust you now!

36.

STARLA

Noooo!

BILL (O.S.)

Starla?!!   Starla, are you in

there?!

BILL (O.S.)

Starla?!

TREVOR

Fuck!

37.

Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.

Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.

EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT

Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind

him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.

Grant is nowhere to be seen.

We CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we...

FADE TO BLACK.

O.S. SNIFFLING.

PASTOR (O.S.)

Jesus, these past few days have

been a trying time for us.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed

little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs,

mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.

PASTOR (O.S.)

We ask you now for the safe return

of our beloved Brenda.

Everyone in this modest little church has their heads

bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service.

PASTOR

Our sister. Our daughter.    Our

mother. Our wife.

Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING.

His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.

PASTOR

And we ask that you keep your light

alive in her heart, wherever she

may be. We ask all this in your

name, Lord. Amen

Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.

BILL                               CONGREGATION

Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the

very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.

38.

BILL (O.S.)

Starla.

BILL

I talked to the CDC. They didn't

have nothin' on file consistent

with Grant's... symptoms.

STARLA

How about Brenda?

BILL

New? No. We're hoping we find

Grant, he'll lead us to her.

BILL

You all right?

STARLA

Yeah.

JACK

Bill!

BILL

Shit.

39.

JACK

Bill, we need to talk!

BILL

'Mornin', Jack.

JACK

Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's

niece. We need to find Grant

yesterday! The town council has

lit a Roman candle and stuck it up

my ass!

BILL

Hell, Jack, your leisure activities

ain't my business.

JACK

Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your

post here as Chief is in dire

straits you don't work this shit

out.

BILL

Don't worry, we'll find him.

(to Trevor)

Anything new?

JACK

How are you going to find him?

BILL

Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many

places he can hide. Sea World,

maybe.

JACK

That young lady heard you say

'squid.' She's gonna go out and

create a Goddamn hysteria!

BILL

Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?

SHERRY

Not today, Bill.

40.

JACK

Still, quit that talk! You yourself

said it was dark in there! You

don't know what you saw!

TREVOR

We saw his arm was all bendy.

JACK

Bastard obviously got lyme disease!

BILL

What?

JACK

Touch some deer feces out in the

forest. Eat a sandwich without

washing your hands. Then you got

lyme disease.

BILL

And that makes you look like a

squid?

JACK

I'll tell you what, no one with

lyme disease gonna win any damn

handsome contests!

JACK

Well, screw you all for laughin'.

SHELBY (O.S.)

Bill!

SHELBY

Another ranch attack!   Up at the

Castavets'.

JACK

'Ranch a -'?   What 'ranch attacks'?

41.

WALLY (O.S.)

It looks like one of them psyche

tests. What do they call it?

BILL

Rorschach.

WALLY

What do you see? I see a butterfly.

BILL

I see we're fucked.   Three ranches

in three days.

MARGARET

So, I think I got it part-way

figured. You want to hear it?

MARGARET

So Grant -- I mean, we're saying

this is Grant, right?

MARGARET

Grant kills a cow right about here.

See there's the blood, musta slit

its neck.

MARGARET

So he drags the cow backwards here.

Only he prolly didn't know 'bout

the Castavets had them dogs.

TREVOR (O.S.)

Hey, look!

TREVOR

He knocked this'n's head clear

over here!

42.

WALLY

Put that down, numbnuts!

MARGARET

So the dogs attacked, somehow he

slew 'em all, and he stole off

with the cow into the forest.

BILL

He's gotta be in the forest. All

three ranches run alongside it.

TREVOR

Think we should get up a search

party, head in there?

WALLY

It's a hundred thousand acres. Be

finding a needle in a fuckstack.

BILL

Wally, come on. Trevor and

Margaret, get some folks together.

I think I know where he's gonna

hit next.

BILL

So the night after Grant ran off,

a calf went missing from here, the

Raglans' ranch.

BILL

Two nights ago, a mare was stolen

from this property, run by

Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with

the cleft palate.

43.

WALLY

Looks like a chipmunk.

BILL

Your momma wasn't too proud when

you came out neither, Wally.

BILL

And then we get here, the

Castavets', where last night's

shit-storm took place.

TREVOR

I see. It's like as if he's going

in a pattern. Is that what you're

saying, Bill?

BILL

And if he sticks to that pattern

he'll be here next. Belongs to a

family, the Strutemyers'. Now I

know y'all are tired and you've

barely seen your families. But

we're gonna have to go there

tonight, lie low and wait.

REDNECK

Let's get that son-of-a-bitch,

Chief.

BILL

Just remember, we don't know what

we're up against here. So let's

be careful.

TREVOR

Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we

confiscated from them jokers wanted

to use it fish for trout?

44.

BILL

Can't hurt.

JACK

I didn't know the Russkies were

invading there, folks.

MARGARET

You seen this guy, you'd wished

they was.

STARLA

Bill, I heard what you're doing.

I think I should go along.

BILL

Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.

I gotta go.

STARLA

Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's

still out there, how will you find

her? How, unless you bring Grant

in alive? Your best chance of

doing that is with me. I can talk

to him --

BILL

He tried to kill you, Starla.

STARLA

He did. I know. But I got him

angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This

time I could --

45.

STARLA

Please, Bill. What happened, it's

my fault, I know it.

BILL

Starla, it ain't --

STARLA

It is. He'd been acting strange.

And the physical changes. I should

have told someone right away...

But I was just blind. I wanted to

pretend it wasn't happening... If

I don't do what I can to help now,

I just couldn't live with it.

KYLIE'S MOM

Kylie! What'd you do to your

fingers?

KYLIE

Kiri Goshima done 'em.    She's

Japanese.

KYLIE'S DAD

Looks like Pokemons done 'em to

me!

KYLIE

Foreign stuff is classy if you

knew something.

KYLIE'S DAD

Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all

to stay inside tonight. All right?

46.

JACK

This turns out to be a mountain

lion we're gonna look like a damn

bunch of idiots.

REDNECK

Didn't know it was date night.

REDNECK

I'll be expecting you toss my salad

at the end of all this then,

Charlie.

GOOD OL' BOY

Shut up.

FADE TO:

47.

BILL

Hey, Starla, remember that time

when you were a kid and you came

knocking on my window in the middle

of the night?

BILL

Starla here's twelve. Guess I was

fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what

the hell you doing out there?'

She tells me she's running away to

Hollywood to become a big star.

She said she knew I was in ROTC,

and she was gonna need a bodyguard.

Invited me along.

BILL

I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody

can take care of herself, I think

it's you. I'm gonna have to

decline.'

WALLY

(to Starla)

How far'd you get?

STARLA

About the bus stop. Ranger Rick

here called my dad.

WALLY

Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You

son-of-a-bitch!

STARLA

You fucked up our fame and fortune,

Bill Pardy.

48.

BILL

Yeah, maybe I did.

STARLA

Grant?

JACK

You said 'squid'!

TREVOR

It got worse.

49.

WALLY

What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs

won't even fit on 'im.

BILL

Starla, where you...?

STARLA

Grant?

STARLA

Grant?   It's okay.

STARLA

You're just sick is all. But we'll

take you to get help right now.

I'll stay by your side, Grant,

just like I swore I would. For

better or worse. Remember?

50.

STARLA

Okay?

STARLA

Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all

right.

GOOD OL' BOY

You stop right there, you son of a

bitch. I don't care what kinda

leprosy you got. We need to find

that girl. Now you can make this

peaceful, or you can make it hard.

BILL

Fire!   Fire!

51.

WALLY

There he is!     Over there!

52.

TREVOR

Where'd he go?

MARGARET

We ain't never gonna find that

girl now.

REDNECK

I'll kill that asshole what he did

to Charlie.

BILL

Starla, get the hell out of here!

MARGARET

Bill!!

TREVOR

What the hell's that smell?

WALLY

It's something dead.

53.

JACK

It's coming from in there, ain't

it?

MARGARET

Think he's inside?

BILL

Oh...

OLDER COP

Oh, shit!

54.

BRENDA

Something's wrong with me.

WALLY

Uh, yeah.

BILL

Brenda, um...

BRENDA

I didn't want no one to be seeing

me like this.

BRENDA

How are my boys, Bill?    Are they

all right?

BILL

Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --

what's happening here, exactly?

BRENDA

I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm

so hungry. I just never knew

anybody could be so hungry.

BRENDA

Would you mind handing me a piece

of that possum there at your feet?

Little bit?

55.

BILL

I think we best get you to a

hospital right quick.

WALLY

What the fuck they gonna do with

her in a hospital, Bill?

OLDER COP

Why's she doing that?!

REDNECK

Her tumors is moving.

JACK

Bill, get her to stop that shit!

BRENDA

It hurts!

BRENDA

Help me!!     Help!!

STARLA

Bill!

BRENDA

Little fuckers are tearing me

aparrrr- !

BILL

He led us here.

56.

BILL

Margaret, cover your mouth!

BILL

Don't let 'em in your mouths!

57.

TREVOR

They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why

would they want that!?

CUT TO:

58.

INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry

sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.

There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward

the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the

window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.

KYLIE'S MOM

Kylie! You're gonna turn into a

plum in there!

KYLIE

Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes.

INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door.

KYLIE'S MOM

I know what turns into what. You

got school tomorrow. Finish up in

there and get to bed.

O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.

Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.

She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --

INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading

Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards.

KYLIE'S MOM

Time to turn in, ladies.

KYLIE'S SISTER 1

Just a couple more pages, Mom?

KYLIE'S MOM

Come on now.

The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their

reading lamps.

KYLIE'S MOM

G'night.

KYLIE'S SISTER 1                  KYLIE'S SISTER 2

59.

KYLIE'S MOM

Sleep tight.   Don't let the bed

bugs bite.

KYLIE

Mom!!

60.

FLASH TO:

61.

KYLIE

Mom!!!

KYLIE

Mom!!    Mom!!!

KYLIE

Emily!!    Jenna!!

62.

KYLIE

No!!   Nooo!!

63.

BILL

11-41. We're gonna need paramedics

out here right away. We got four

men down.

BILL

Shelby, you there?

BILL

Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an

emergency here.

BILL

Goddammit.

BILL

Shelby?

64.

MARGARET

Is he alive?

MARGARET

Praise Jesus.

TREVOR

'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking

pushing it, Margaret.

TREVOR

What the hell were those things?!

You ever seen anything like that?

You ever heard of anything like

that?

TREVOR

Me neither. And I watch 'Animal

Planet' all the fuckin' time!

BILL

No reception out here.

STARLA

Bill, I'll run out to your car,

call for paramedics from there.

MARGARET

That's a long ways. Them worms

are out there.

STARLA

I'll keep my mouth covered.

BILL

No. I'll go. The three of you,

you wait here. Get these folks,

out of the barn. The stench and

rot can't be any good for 'em.

65.

STARLA

Be careful, Bill.

TREVOR

It's got to be some Goddamn

biological weapons. Government's

testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who

gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,

right?!

TREVOR

I hope it ain't contagious. I'll

be pissed as hell I turn into a

big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I

swear to God.

66.

WALLY

Hey, sugarplum.

STARLA

What?

WALLY

Marriage. It's a sacred bond.

Just like you said.

WALLY

I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle

you and all. I lost -- Lost my

head. I didn't want to do none of

the things I done. Not kill them

pets. Not make Brenda a womb.

But it's my nature, ain't it? How

can you blame a one for actin'

according to his nature?

WALLY

I wanted to tell you what was going

on. But I didn't - didn't think

you'd love me no more. I never

knew... love, Starla, I --

MARGARET

Wally?

MARGARET

You all right?

67.

MARGARET

Maybe you better sit back down.

You don't look so good.

TREVOR

Margaret.

KYLIE'S DAD

Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on

out.

KYLIE'S SISTER 2

Hi, Kylie.   It's me.

KYLIE'S MOM

Open the door, sweetie. I know we

don't look so good, but your mommy

and daddy love you.

KYLIE

Get away!!

KYLIE'S MOM

Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why

not to be with your family. This

is family fun day, isn't it?

68.

KYLIE'S SISTER 1

Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-

ance.

BILL

Hey!

BILL

What's -- ?

BILL

What's going on here?

KYLIE'S DAD

Well, hello there, Pardy.

BILL

What happened to you, Dwight?

KYLIE'S DAD

Poison ivy out back, maybe?

69.

KYLIE'S SISTERS

We're itchy!

KYLIE

They're not my... They killed...

BILL

Okay. Y'all just wait in this

spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics

for you. Kylie can come with --

RANCHER (O.S.)

Hey there, killer.

BILL

Come on.

MARGARET

Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just

sit down! You need to get some

Goddamn rest! You're sick!

70.

TREVOR

Let go!!

MARGARET

It burns!!

MARGARET

What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!

OLDER COP

Meat.

STARLA (O.S.)

Let him go!

STARLA

Trevor, come on.

STARLA

What'd you do to her?!

71.

Jack stares at Starla.    He too speaks with Grant's cadence.

JACK

There you go, sugarplum! Why you

choosing camps 'fore you hear --

JACK                            REDNECK

STARLA

Why are you talking like Grant?!

The posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse

makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:

WALLY

'Cause I am Grant!

WALLY                           REDNECK

JACK

You swore to honor and obey --

OLDER COP                       REDNECK

gun down.

STARLA

Don't come any closer.    I'll...

shoot.

WALLY

You ain't gonna shoot me! You

always needed me to protect you!

You for damn sure ain't got the

balls to --

Starla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his

face.

Wally falls to his knees.    Starla and Trevor look on in

shock, as they see...

A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his

face -- out of the Wally's brain.

The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers

off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.

The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.

And then they leap at her.

Starla tries to shoot them.   But she's out of ammo.

72.

TREVOR

Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!

BILL

Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.

BILL

Trevor!   Margaret!

TREVOR

They killed Margaret!

BILL

(into radio)

Where are you?!

73.

TREVOR (O.S.)

We're coming your way, man!

KYLIE

Go!   Go!   Please!

BILL

My friends are still in the forest.

BILL

We need their weight.

BILL

Dumbshits.

74.

BILL

Come on!

OLDER COP

Starla!!

BILL

Shelby?

75.

BILL

Shelby, you there?

SHELBY (O.S.)

Yo, Chief.   How y'all doin'?

SHELBY

You dig that rat out of the hole?

BILL

Listen, you got any reports of...

I don't know what you call 'em.

They look like big slugs, only

fast.

SHELBY

Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin'

about that new waitress down at

Sloan's! Ha ha!

BILL

Shelby --

SHELBY

Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police

radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -

BILL

Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out

for these things. If you see 'em,

keep your mouth covered. Otherwise

they'll go straight down it. All

right?

BILL

Are you nodding?

SHELBY

Yeah.

76.

BILL

I can't hear when you're nodding.

SHELBY

Sorry.

BILL

We'll be there in ten minutes.

KYLIE

The worms are in their brains.

KYLIE (O.S.)

Drivin' 'em around...

STARLA

She's right. We saw one -- one

came out of Wally's head.

TREVOR

Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came

out there --

STARLA

Kylie, how do you --

STARLA

Kylie, how do you know that?

BILL

Kylie, honey.    Please.

(MORE)

77.

BILL (CONT'D)

A lot of bad things have happened

to you today, we know. But we

need your help to find out what's

going on.

KYLIE

I was in the bath. It tried to go

inside me and I -- for a minute I

became it.

BILL

The worm?

KYLIE

I got it out.

TREVOR

What are they?

KYLIE

Part of him.

BILL

Who?

(pause)

Who?

KYLIE

Mrs. Grant's husband.

KYLIE

But not always. I was -- He was...

other stuff too.

STARLA

What other stuff?

TREVOR

He's a fucking Martian?!

BILL

A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.

KYLIE

For real it looks like a needle.

Its real face. But it always gots

another.

(MORE)

78.

KYLIE (CONT'D)

He goes from place to place,

worlds... planets... killing 'em.

He takes over half of what's alive

and eats the other half. Till

they're gone.

KYLIE

Now he's here.     He went in Mr.

Grant.

STARLA

Through a wound on his stomach?

KYLIE

He took him over. His body. His --

his brain, everything what he knew.

He's only been dumb stuff before -

amoeba-things, and rhino-things.

He liked being human. Didn't want

to change.

STARLA

And you said the worms are part of

him. They're all linked, like one

creature?

KYLIE

When one sees you they all see

you.

STARLA

An animal that doesn't procreate.

It spreads, grows. A living

disease.

BILL

(to Kylie)

So the way to stop this thing is

to stop Grant?

BILL

Shit.

79.

BILL

Shelby, we broke down on 22, a

mile outside town. Come pick us

up.

SHELBY (O.S.)

I got to leave my post.

BILL

Do it.

BILL

Hey, Starla.

BILL

Was always curious why you...

married Grant in the first place...

Just never seemed outta love.

STARLA

I know what people say, Bill.

I... Remember, back in high school

I worked at my father's gas station?

STARLA

Grant used to get filled up every

day. I knew it was just to see

me. He was too old -- But he was

handsome. And he had that big ol'

Lincoln then. I flirted with him.

BILL

Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess

I would have flirted with him too.

80.

STARLA

My father, he was -- he was real

close to evil. People didn't know.

Still don't. From the time I was

a toddler he'd beat the hell out

of me. I don't mean just like a

smack for smart-mouthing... he

took a real enjoyment in it. And

when I turned eleven or twelve,

things... well, they got worse.

BILL

When you wanted to run away, I

called your dad.

STARLA

That wasn't a good night, no.

BILL

I'm sorry.

STARLA

Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I

fill his tank with like an eighth-

a-gallon as usual. And he notices

my lip's all swollen up, and starts

asking me how it happened. I don't

know why I chose then, why Grant --

I guess I saw an opportunity. And

I told him everything, first time

I told anyone. Grant was furious.

He picked up a tire iron, walked

straightaway into the garage, and

beat my father half to death. You

say it's not about love, Bill.

But that was the closest thing to

it I ever knew.

STARLA

Grant asked me to marry him a few

weeks later. I felt... safe with

him.

STARLA

After all this shit tonight, I

know for sure now you regret not

running off with me to Hollywood!

81.

BILL

Hell, Starla.    I always regretted

that.

TREVOR

Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon,

we'll be in town, everything'll be

fine.

STARLA

What's that?

TREVOR

They musta hit a deer. Probably

got out to see if it's okay.

82.

BILL

Fuck me.

TREVOR

Bambi-rats!

83.

STARLA

Get in!

84.

BILL

Shelby!

TREVOR

When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving

them things the hell out!

BILL

Shelby!

SHELBY (O.S.)

Hey there, Chief.

BILL

Shelby! We need people out here

at Cosgrove and McCammon right

away!

SHELBY (O.S.)

Don't worry, Chief.

SHELBY

Already on our way.

85.

DISEASED TOWNSFOLK

Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!

BILL

Come on.

86.

TREVOR

What the hell are we going to do?!

BILL

Just block the doors, any way you

can.

TREVOR

Goddamn snakes!!

87.

STARLA

This is stupid.

BILL

What are you doing?!

STARLA

We can't make it. Just get away,

when you get the chance.

BILL

What?

STARLA

He wants me, Bill! I'm going to

get him to take me to him! See if

you can follow me, and kill him!

BILL

No, Starla!   No!

88.

Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A

DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see

it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor

looks down, in shock.

And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The

Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over

him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor

starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab

him.

BILL

Nooo!

Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him

away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid

has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart

like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.

Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.

Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.

She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this

side of the building anymore. She moves outside.

EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT

Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING

and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he

makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across

the street.

He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But

she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.

Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head

for Bill to go. Bill is confused.

The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the

sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to

Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily

at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in

their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.

DISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID

And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all

the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they

inherited from Grant Grant, such as:

SMASHED-FACE MAN

You said for better or worse! You

lied!

NO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND

89.

SHELBY                           FAT SICK GUY

MR. INAPPROPRIATE                WAITRESS

BRENDA'S HUSBAND

You like Pardy better'n me? That's

who you want to screw now?!

STARLA

Grant... Please...

They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her

breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.

STARLA

I'm sorry... I know I haven't

behaved how you -- how you want.

I know. Don't... hurt... me.

Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her

calf, tasting her.

STARLA

We need... to... talk.

A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.

DISEASED MAN                     BRENDA'S HUSBAND

STARLA

Not here, though, okay? Not all

of you. I'm not used to -- I want

to talk to your face, Grant. Your

more real face. Your --

The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and

start dragging her away.

A few townsfolk remain behind.    They look around for Bill.

SMASHED-FACE MAN

Pardy?!!   Where are you, Pardy!!

But he's nowhere to be seen.    They SCREECH angrily.

EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the

same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.

90.

EXT. SIDE OF MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a

dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead

bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some

infected townsfolk.

Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.

Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.

DISEASED WOMAN               SHELBY

PASTOR

We've surrounded the town, you

prick! Ain't no way outta here!

Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill

looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard

moving Starla across that street.

He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.

EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER

One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls

to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She

stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost

hyperventilating.

EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She

looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front

yard. Starla gazes up at her home:

The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the

front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive

thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been

partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,

the roof is caved-in and sloping.

Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of

the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.

EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT

Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can

see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind

some shrubs.

91.

STARLA

Grant?

92.

STARLA

Grant?   We should talk.

STARLA

Grant?

93.

STARLA

Hey, Grant.

STARLA

You did some real interesting

decorating here.

STARLA

Hey.

STARLA

Look, the sun's starting to come

up.

STARLA

Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know

you wanted it dark.

94.

STARLA

You like these memories, huh, Grant?

STARLA

You like being called Grant, don't

you?

STARLA

I think you do. You really do.

You like being Grant. Like when

we danced. And when you... made

love to me here on the bed.

Remember that?

STARLA

I know you've been alone, Grant.

Almost forever. From here to there

to there to here, there's never

been another one for you.

STARLA

Grant. Grant, I could help you.

Be with you the way you want.

See, I want to live. I've never

had much use for this world, not

really. You and I, together, we --

STARLA

You don't trust me, I know. That's

why I brought you someone, Grant.

95.

STARLA

It's Bill. He's in the house next

door. Just look.

STARLA

See? I brought him here for you!

As an offering! To prove I love

you more than him!

96.

STARLA

Now, Bill!!   Kill the motherfucker!!

97.

GRANT

Er...?

FADE TO:

98.

STARLA

Hey.

BILL

Hey.

BILL

Starla, over here.

99.

STARLA

We can probably get some first aid

and food at this gas station up

here.

BILL

Yeah.   Good.

CASHIER

Comes to 32.87.

BILL

There you go.

100.

STARLA

Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to

get aspirin.

BILL

I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or

aspirin?

STARLA

Aspirin.

BILL

We'll just head up here into

Bishopville, get checked up in the

hospital. Then maybe we'll head

off to Hollywood after all, huh?

STARLA

Okay.

BILL

Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my

best not to hurt anybody --

STARLA

You took Bill.

BILL

It's my nature.

101.

STARLA

And this is mine.

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END
