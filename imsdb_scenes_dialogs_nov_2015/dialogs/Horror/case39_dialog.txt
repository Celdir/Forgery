1.

FRIGHTENED EYE

GIRL

I can see you...

DARLA

-- and we know from yesterday that the

base of a triangle times half the height

equals the area.

DARLA

Yes, Mia?

GIRL

Lucy's asleep again.

DARLA

Let her sleep.

2.

GANG MEMBER

He would just go off, you know, start

tearin' the place down. You didn't even

know why he was doin' it half the time,

you just got out of his way...

EMILY

And what you learned from your father now

Diego's learning from you...?

EMILY

That really upsets you, doesn't it?

GANG MEMBER

Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be

like me.

EMILY

A whole week without skipping school? Is

that true?

EMILY

That's the last time I make a bet with

you.

(to his parents)

See you guys next week.

BELEAGUERED MOTHER:

3.

EMILY

You cut your hair. It looks great.

EMILY

No one is trying to steal your child,

they found bruises and cigarette burns --

Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report --

well, if you feel you need legal

representation that's perfectly within

your rights...

WAYNE (O.S.)

One less Christmas card for Emily.

WAYNE

How many active cases you have?

EMILY

Thirty-eight.

EMILY

No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne,

look, I'm buried --

WAYNE

Sorry, Em, we all are.

4.

EMILY

Don't fight. Hey, that's his.

YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE

Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga the

other day, give me a call.

YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE #2

Hi, Em, Jackie, just checking in, hope

you're good.

DOUG'S VOICE

Exhausted, her career path questionable,

her faith in mankind shaken, she resisted

her tendency toward introspection and

went to have a drink with her friend

Doug.

5.

DOUG

I am so in your head.

EMILY

Be honest. The whole psychology thing,

it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?

DOUG

Regrettably, yes.

EMILY

You know what freaks me out?

DOUG

That you have a four-year degree and make

seventeen grand a year after taxes?

EMILY

I sit there talking to these families,

you know, like I'm some expert. My

family's a train wreck. I mean, I had

this moment today where I realized I

might be totally full of it.

DOUG

Everybody's full of it. In the end

you're a number to call for people who

don't have anyone else. There's no way

that's bad.

EMILY

Hey Becca...

FRIEND

(HUGGING HER)

Hey. So one of us is a major screwup, I

can't remember if I was supposed to call

you or the other way around...?

EMILY

No, it's me, it's just been a crazy

couple weeks. You remember Doug.

6.

FRIEND

(HANDSHAKE)

Hi.

(then to Emily)

Listen, my ride's leaving, let's catch up

soon, okay?

DOUG

So anyway, I've done some soul searching

and I just want to say that if a full-on

relationship feels like too much right

now, I'd be willing to consider a purely

physical one.

DOUG

Hey, you might actually enjoy yourself.

EMILY

I'm sure I would, I just...

DOUG

I know, I know, the job, you get home you

don't have anything left.

EMILY

If it were anyone, it'd be you.

EMILY

What are they doing to you?

7.

TRACKS -

WOMAN'S VOICE

What?

EMILY

Emily Jennings. Child Services? We

spoke on the phone...?

MARGARET

You said the seventeenth.

EMILY

Today is the seventeenth.

MARGARET

Is not.

EMILY

I'm sorry, but it is.

MARGARET

Friday was the thirteenth.

EMILY

Friday was the fourteenth, that makes

today the seventeenth. Monday the

seventeenth. The date of our

appointment.

8.

EMILY

Come down, I'd like to meet you.

EMILY

My name's Emily. What's yours?

LUCY

Lucy.

EMILY

Pretty name. Pretty girl.

EMILY

(TO MARGARET)

Is there somewhere we can talk?

EMILY

When do you expect your husband back?

EMILY

Because we've found it's more beneficial

if the whole family participates.

MARGARET

Well he's not home so...

9.

EMILY

Do you have any way of contacting him?

MARGARET

Not if I don't know where he is.

EMILY

Is that...?

EMILY

Would you ask him to join us?

MARGARET

He doesn't have anything to say.

EMILY

Would you ask him?

MARGARET (O.S.)

Edward! EDWARD!

MARGARET (O.S.)

That lady's here. From the state. She

wants to talk to you.

MARGARET (O.S.)

I already told her, she wants to anyway.

EMILY

It'll be okay.

10.

EMILY

Hi, I'm Emily --

EMILY

I'm here today because Lucy's school is

concerned about changes they're seeing in

her academic performance. The kinds of

changes they're seeing are often

associated with family problems.

MARGARET

Eddie says we don't have family problems.

EMILY

That's just it, many times a family won't

even know they're having problems until

it's too late. That's where we come in.

We help families communicate and learn

healthier ways of resolving conflict.

MARGARET

Eddie says we don't need your help.

EMILY

Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you

won't speak to me directly?

EMILY

(TO MARGARET)

Is there some reason why your husband

won't speak to me directly?

MARGARET

Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.

11.

WAYNE

No laws against being weird, Em. Send it

over to CMC, we'll do a follow-up in a

month.

EMILY

I didn't say weird, I said scary. The

guy sat there the entire time staring at

me, the mother is like his emotional

slave.

WAYNE

Wait, did you just fly to New York and

meet my parents?

EMILY

Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can

feel it.

WAYNE

Wanna know what I can feel? The lawsuit

we're gonna get hit with if we violate

her parents' rights without any evidence

they've done something wrong.

EMILY

Every time I talk to you you sound more

like a lawyer, you know that?

WAYNE

Yeah, well, maybe because every time I

make an emotional decision I get called

by one. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to

let this one go.

EMILY

You put these files in front of me and

you ask me to tell you what's going on.

Well, I'm telling you, there's something

going on and it's not something good.

I've done my job, I've told you, what you

do with it is yours.

12.

EDWARD

They really are God's miracles. Day she

was born was the happiest day of our

lives. We're not perfect parents, we

know that, but we figure if you let `em

know how much you love `em a lot of the

other stuff takes care of itself.

EMILY

(HOSTILE)

Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've

suddenly acquired the power of speech,

doesn't it concern you a little that

Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's

in three months?

EDWARD

Course it does, she's our daughter.

EMILY

So you have no idea why she's falling

asleep at school every day? Why she's

not able to sleep at home?

EDWARD

Bad dreams?

13.

EMILY

He's gonna be having bad dreams when he

gets hit with child endangerment.

(off Wayne's reluctance)

Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's

little girl routine?

WAYNE

So they're overcompensating a little.

EMILY

A little? Let me talk to her. Alone.

She wants to talk.

WAYNE

EM --

EMILY

Five minutes. Talk to them about how

much they love kids.

EMILY

I knew someone at school named Lucy, she

was a writer. Do you ever write? I do

sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm

feeling.

EMILY

Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water

up my nose. So much for establishing

trust.

DEEPENING IT:

EMILY

What's happening to you? I can help.

Let me help.

14.

EMILY

What is it, sweetheart?

LUCY

They hate me.

EMILY

I'm sure they don't hate you.

LUCY

They do. I hear them. They go in the

cellar and talk.

EMILY

What do they talk about?

LUCY

Sending me to hell.

EMILY

You've heard them say that?

EMILY

It's okay. You can tell him. He's on

our side.

WAYNE

Did you hear your parents say they were

going to hurt you?

15.

EMILY

She doesn't trust anybody. You think I

made it up?

WAYNE

I think you'd do just about anything you

had to do to help a child you thought was

at risk. Here are the facts, Emily.

They haven't laid a finger on her that we

can tell. And we have no proof they

intend to. Meanwhile on your desk right

now are thirty-plus cases of actionable

abuse. What about those?

EMILY

I'm not giving up on her, Wayne.

WAYNE

Yes, you are, you're leaving this alone.

EMILY

I hope you can live with a dead child on

your conscience.

WAYNE

(HURT)

That's a little unfair, don't you think?

I care about these kids as much as you

do, but we can't go around yanking them

out of their homes on a hunch. Parents,

even bad ones, have rights, that's how

the laws of this great land are written.

EMILY

So that's it? We let kids get killed

until they rewrite the goddamn laws?

16.

BARRON

Was just thinking about you, got a nice

letter from Sandy Hutchinson...

BARRON

Well, it's sitting in front of me which

means our good friend Wayne thinks it

fails to meet the criteria for child

endangerment and has told you in no

uncertain terms to leave it alone...?

EMILY

Surprise, surprise.

BARRON

I can't, Emily. I'm sorry.

EMILY

Mike, I'm desperate here.

BARRON

You know how dear to my heart the work

you do is, but the department doesn't pay

me to stakeout potential child abusers.

Last time almost cost me my job.

EMILY

This girl heard her parents say they're

going to send her to hell.

BARRON

Sickening as that is, you're a part of

the system that handles those situations,

I'm not.

EMILY

The system is broken.

BARRON

Maybe you just need to let it work.

17.

EMILY

What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to

Wayne. You don't want to get involved,

fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running

out of people I respect.

BARRON

Okay. No bullshit. Give me evidence of

a crime, I'll be all over it. Till then

there's nothing I can do.

CUT TO:

EMILY (O.S.)

Lucy.

EMILY

I just wanted you to know I haven't

forgotten about you. I'm doing

everything I can.

LUCY

If I disappear will you come look for me?

18.

EMILY

You're not going to disappear.

LUCY

If I do?

LUCY

I have to go. They get mad when I miss

the bus.

EMILY

Lucy, wait...

EMILY

If anything happens, call me, okay? Just

press this. Don't let your parents know

you have it.

EMILY

I'm gonna get you out of there, I

promise.

MESSAGE:

ANSWERING MACHINE

Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -

EMILY

It's me, thought you might be up, um,

anyway, call if you get this.

19.

EMILY

Too late, I met someone else...

LUCY (V.O.)

Emily...?

EMILY

(concerned but calm)

Lucy? Are you okay?

LUCY (V.O.)

I'm scared...

EMILY

Why? Why are you scared, honey?

LUCY (V.O.)

They're waiting to get me, I can hear

them... I'm sorry...

EMILY

Why are you sorry?

LUCY (V.O.)

I'm falling asleep...

EMILY

Okay, listen, I want you to go over and

open the window. Can you do that?

Lucy...?

LUCY (V.O.)

(softly; drifting off)

I'm sooorry...

EMILY

Lucy, no, wake up!

EMILY

(FROM PHONE)

Lucy...?!

20.

EMILY

Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I

told you about, I think she's in trouble -

- yeah, I know what you said, but --

Mike, you're not listening --

(LOSES IT)

HELP ME!

21.

BARRON

What are we doing here?

EMILY

Saving her life!

BARRON

They're asleep.

EMILY

They're not asleep.

EMILY

Did you hear that?

BARRON

I didn't hear anything.

EMILY

Leave her alone!

22.

EMILY

Did you hear that?!

BARRON

Police, open up!

EMILY

Break it down!

EMILY

BREAK IT DOWN!

EMILY

LUCY?!

23.

EMILY

Oh my God...

BARRON

The hell's the matter with you people?!

EMILY

I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha...

STATE PROSECUTOR

Prosecution asks that you disallow an

insanity defense. This was an act

committed with premeditation, malice

AFORETHOUGHT -

PUBLIC DEFENDER

Your honor, the egregiousness of the

crime makes the competency question all

the more relevant.

JUDGE

Yes. I hereby order the defendants

undergo psychiatric evaluation to

determine their mental fitness for trial.

24.

EMILY

Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing

your kid, Freudian dream analysis.

BARRON

Well, you're gonna hate me for saying

this, but my money's on crazy.

EMILY

Did they or did they not know what they

were doing? That's the legal standard.

They knew, they knew damn well!

BARRON

It's not that simple sometimes.

EMILY

(stops on a dime)

Meaning what exactly?

BARRON

When we brought them in that night they

told Captain Lister... They think she's

evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion

of the devil or something.

EMILY

(LAUGHS)

Oh, that's great - what is this, late-

night cable?

BARRON

No, but that might be the world they're

living in.

DOUG

-- and what's the most important thing we

talked about that you have to remember?

25.

LUCY

It's not my fault what happened.

DOUG

That's right and you know what? It's

not.

DOUG

That is some seriously proactive social

work happenin' there. You all right?

EMILY

Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing?

DOUG

Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll

get there. I'm gonna put her in a group

setting, see if I can get her to open up.

EMILY

Group therapy for kids, what's that say

about the world?

EMILY

Good news. You get to leave here

tomorrow.

LUCY

Doug said I might have to go to a state

home.

EMILY

Only for a few days, till we find a

better place.

LUCY

Why can't I live with you?

EMILY

Oh, sweetheart. That would never be

allowed.

LUCY

Why?

26.

EMILY

It's complicated, there's a whole

process, I'm not even a foster parent...

EMILY

I'm sorry.

COORDINATOR

They were supposed to call you. We don't

have any rooms.

EMILY

Nothing?

COORDINATOR

There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry.

TIME CUT TO:

EMILY

Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some

lunch. What kind of food do you like?

LUCY

There's nowhere for me to go is there?

27.

EMILY

I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live

in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm

not mom material...

LUCY

You don't have to be my mom. Just my

friend.

EMILY

I know what it feels like to be that age

and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She

needs to be with someone she trusts; she

trusts me. So much of our time is spent

negotiating red tape, I think if we just

look at the situation - this one

situation, this one child - it's clear

what's best for her.

NANCY

This is highly irregular and I'll tell

you right now it makes me very

uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've

spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's

behalf...

NANCY (V.O.)

...I'm going to go against my better

judgement and approve this petition for

temporary custody.

28.

EMILY

I like to think of it as a glass-half-

full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom.

Fish. And here, is your room...

EMILY

Be okay?

LUCY

Where's your family?

EMILY

My family... well, I've met my dad twice

and my mom's not a part of my life

anymore.

LUCY

Why?

EMILY

(choosing her words)

Sometimes people have kids and then

decide they don't want to be parents.

EMILY

I'm glad you're here.

TIME CUT TO:

LUCY

What's this?

EMILY

Chamomile, when I get stressed out it

helps me sleep.

29.

EMILY

None of this ever should have happened,

if I could make it go away I would.

LUCY

You did.

EMILY

I'm right down the hall if you need me.

EMILY

I have to grab some of her things, might

take me a minute.

COURT CLERK

I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on

the way out.

WALL -

30.

31.

A BARRICADE

LUCY'S BEDROOM

DOUG

Sometimes when our parents aren't getting

along it's better if they don't see each

other for a while, that's what a

`restraining order' does...

TIME CUT TO:

DOUG

She's starting to come out of her shell.

It's good, I just wish I thought it was

me making the difference.

32.

EMILY

I went by the house. I think her mom and

dad were barricading themselves in their

room at night. How sick is that?

DOUG

Hatred and fear are part of the same

pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't

think they're crazy.

EMILY

I'm coming around.

EMILY

Okay?

EMILY

This is your new beginning.

LUCY

I love you, Emily.

EMILY

I love you, too.

COWORKER

Wayne's looking for you.

33.

COWORKER #2

Wayne wants to --

EMILY

Got it.

EMILY

What's up with Diego?

WAYNE

Why don't we talk in my office.

EMILY

Tell me what's going on.

WAYNE

We don't know why yet, but... he killed

his mother and father last night.

EMILY

What happened?

BARRON

Sure you want to see this?

34.

BARRON

Gets a tire iron from the garage, comes

back inside, locks all the doors and

windows, kills them in their sleep...

BARRON

Had to use dental records to identify the

bodies.

EMILY

An eight-year-old did this? There's no

way.

BARRON

I was there when they brought him in.

Took three guys my size to subdue him.

Kid was climbing the walls.

BARRON

Just your average American family.

EMILY

Where is he now?

BARRON

Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking

you to see him.

EMILY

You want to know what happened?

BARRON

I know what happened.

EMILY

I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike,

please, I care about this kid.

35.

EMILY

Diego...

EMILY

Let me in. He won't hurt me.

DIEGO

Are they dead?

EMILY

What happened? Tell me what happened.

DIEGO

(SOBBING)

I killed my mum and dad...

DOUG

Every family you sit down with every day

of every week is a family in crisis.

Those are your odds. That's the job you

do. Trying to beat them.

DOUG

You're one person, Em. You can't save

the world.

(THEN)

I know somebody you did save.

36.

LUCY

You okay?

EMILY

It's just work. Don't worry.

LUCY

Why do you do it if it makes you sad?

EMILY

My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess

maybe I want to believe families can

work, so I can have my own someday, I

don't know - does that make sense?

EMILY

(calls to other room)

Breakfast.

EMILY

Honey, breakfa--

37.

EMILY

Come on, let me see...

EMILY

You went through my things?

LUCY

I'm sorry... I wanted to know what

happened to you.

LUCY

Is that your mom?

EMILY

She used to just leave, she'd just...

(GESTURES `ADIOS')

...and I never knew when she was coming

back, or if she was... I used to think it

was my fault and I would try so hard when

she got home to be good, do everything I

could think of, so she'd think I was

`special' and stay next time or take me

with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd

always go away again, that's how it was.

LUCY

Where was your dad?

EMILY

Gone, he left before I was born. First

time I met him I was like thirteen.

38.

LUCY

What'd you say to him?

EMILY

Oh, I had all these things I was gonna

say. Angry things I'd thought of and

kind of memorized. And um.... And then I

met him and I wasn't angry, I was just

sad and I told him...

(pauses, raw emotion)

I said, I love you, even if you don't

love me.

LUCY

Are you mad at me?

EMILY

No... No, I'm not mad at you.

(puts her arm around her)

But I need you not to do that again,

okay? Go through my private things

without asking?

EMILY

Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry.

WAYNE

(SYMPATHETIC)

I need another set of eyes to go over

them, make sure we haven't missed

anything else.

EMILY

You mean, to make sure I haven't missed

anything else?

39.

WAYNE

It's just a legal thing. You'll have

them back tomorrow.

BARRON

You watch, six months, their lawyer will

hire some expert to say they're rehabbed

and they'll sue for custody when they get

out.

EMILY

She's not going back there, I'll take her

out of state before I let them near her

again.

BARRON

I didn't hear you say that.

EMILY

You wanted to talk about something?

BARRON

We pulled the Martinezes' phone records.

They got a call that night before the

murders.

EMILY

From who?

BARRON

(SOBER PAUSE)

Emily, the call came from your house.

EMILY

What...?

40.

BARRON

Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, I

just need to know what was said.

EMILY

That's impossible. I might have called

the week before...?

BARRON

I'm talking to you as a friend here, you

know that, right?

EMILY

Did you not hear me? I'm telling you,

Mike, as a friend, I did not call that

family.

BARRON

Then who did? Go find the guy who broke

in and just happened to dial the number

of a kid whose case you handle.

LUCY

He's in my group...

(puts down photo)

...why, did something happen?

BARRON

We're trying to figure out why. He got a

call Thursday night from this number.

I'm just wondering if he might have said

anything...

LUCY

It wasn't me.

BARRON

You didn't call him?

41.

BARRON

Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the

truth, but I know you will because you're

a good little girl.

LUCY

I am telling the truth.

EMILY

My backup files are in your room.

Diego's is in there. Maybe you got

curious and went through some, dialed a

number?

LUCY

It wasn't me, I swear.

BARRON

The call was at 2 am, are you ever up

that late?

LUCY

I didn't call him.

BARRON

Are you ever up that late?

EMILY

Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a

mistake.

BARRON

Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy.

BARRON

She's lying.

LUCY

Do you believe me?

42.

EMILY

I believe you.

EMILY

Give me back my cases or fire me. Right

now.

EMILY

I don't care if it's a hairline fracture,

he broke her arm, I don't want him back

in that house. He what? He found

Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh.

Well he should have found Him sooner.

EMILY

What's up?

DOUG

Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for

the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy

did for me the other day.

EMILY

(re: Lucy's profile)

How's it look?

DOUG WINTERS

Normal.

43.

EMILY

Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me

what's going on?

DOUG

You have to beg.

(SAME BREATH)

Coming from an environment like that,

testing this normal is a bit abnormal, if

that makes any sense.

EMILY

She's `abnormally normal'?

DOUG

I think she faked it, gave the answers

she thought she should.

EMILY

Why would she do that?

DOUG

(SHRUGS)

She's ashamed of who she is. Ashamed of

how she feels. Afraid nobody would want

her if they saw the real her.

(off Emily's reaction)

It's no big deal, it just means I might

have to push her a little.

EMILY

No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got

a call Thursday night. From my house.

DOUG

Did you ask her about it?

EMILY

She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's

lying.

DOUG

What do you think?

EMILY

I don't know what to think.

DOUG

Hmm. Bring her in after work, I'll do a

one-on-one. I wanted to talk to her

about this anyway.

44.

EMILY

Got you an extra in case it gets cold.

EMILY

I need to ask you something... about the

night it happened... did you get a call,

really late?

EMILY

You didn't?

EMILY

Diego, I know you did, they called from

my house.

EMILY

What's the matter? What's scaring you?

EMILY

Oh God...

EMILY

It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be

okay...

(yelling down hall)

Can somebody help us down here?!

45.

NURSE

He asked to see you before you left.

EMILY

Who called you? Was it Lucy?

EMILY

Did she say something to you? Something

that scared you?

DIEGO

El dijo...

EMILY

`El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'?

DIEGO

Era un hombre.

EMILY

It was a man?

46.

LUCY

Do...

(TURNS)

you...

(TURNS)

like...

(TURNS)

working...

(TURNS)

here?

EMILY

Well, photocopying isn't much fun.

EMILY

What...?

DOUG

Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys.

(TO LUCY)

Ready, kiddo?

DOUG

Go ahead down, I'll be right there.

DOUG

(TO EMILY)

You all right?

EMILY

This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy

that called, but he called her a he, he

said it was a man.

47.

DOUG

So how's school?

LUCY

Fine.

DOUG

Any of your classmates giving you a hard

time?

LUCY

No, they've been nice.

DOUG

Sleeping okay?

LUCY

That's not really what you want to talk

about, is it, Doug?

DOUG

You got me.

DOUG

Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark?

You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you

afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are

afraid of your parents? `No'. You

answered `no' to everything in that

section. I think some of those should

have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of

something. Working through our fears,

conquering them, is how we get better.

So I want you to tell me... What scares

you?

48.

LUCY

I'll tell you what scares me if you tell

me what scares you.

DOUG

Fair enough. When I was twelve I was

climbing a tree and I accidentally put my

hand through a giant hornets' nest. They

didn't like it. I got stung over a

hundred times. They had to rush me to

the hospital. I've been afraid of

hornets ever since. Don't climb many

trees either.

(SMILES)

Everybody has fears. Now, what scares

you?

LUCY

Me.

DOUG

You scare yourself?

LUCY

Sometimes.

DOUG

Why, what about yourself scares you?

LUCY

I have bad thoughts.

DOUG

About what?

LUCY

People.

DOUG

People in general or certain people?

LUCY

Certain people.

DOUG

Like who?

LUCY

You.

49.

DOUG

You have bad thoughts about me?

(SHE NODS)

Why?

LUCY

(SHRUGS)

I just do.

DOUG

Was there something I said or did that

upset you?

LUCY

(shakes her head)

It's just the way you are...

DOUG

How am I?

LUCY

Facile.

DOUG

Facile?

(she nods yes)

Do you even know what that means?

LUCY

Easily comprehended. Often lacking

sincerity or depth. You're smug, too.

Want me to tell you what that means?

DOUG

Well, if, um, if I seemed `smug' or

`facile' I want to -

LUCY

(GIRLISH LAUGH)

Don't apologize.

DOUG

Why?

LUCY

You're a grown up, it's embarrassing.

(THEN; DEADPAN)

(MORE)

50.

LUCY(CONT'D)

Should we talk about school now? My

grades are getting a lot better.

DOUG

Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't

think I've ever felt like that before...

EMILY

Like what?

DOUG

Threatened.

(THEN; BAFFLED)

I know a specialist, I'll call him in the

morning.

EMILY

What do I do with her in the meantime?

DOUG

Don't let her get in your head.

LUCY

Are you mad at me?

EMILY

No. Just tired.

51.

LUCY

Want me to brush your hair?

EMILY

That's okay.

LUCY

Are you sure?

EMILY

Some other time.

LUCY

(STANDS UP)

It will make you feel better. I'll get

the brush.

EMILY

I said no, thank you.

LUCY

Doug said something, didn't he?

EMILY

No. Doug? He says you're doing great.

LUCY

What did he tell you?

EMILY

Nothing.

LUCY

You're funny.

SAYS GOODNIGHT:

EMILY

Get some rest.

52.

LUCY

You forgot to kiss me goodnight.

EMILY

Goodnight.

LUCY

I love you.

EMILY

I love you, too.

DOUG

Hello?

DOUG

Hello...?

DOUG

Try again, sorry.

53.

HORNET

DOUG

FUCK!

54.

55.

FAMILY -

EMILY

See you next week.

DENISE

Seen Doug? He had an appointment with

one of my kids this morning, never showed

up.

EMILY

Did you try calling him?

DENISE

All I get is voicemail.

FIRST RING:

ANSWERING MACHINE

Hey, this is Doug, here it comes -

EMILY

Cover my desk.

EMILY

Doug, it's me, it's Emily...

56.

EMILY

Doug?

EMILY

Doug, you here?

EMILY

NOOOOO!!!!!

EMILY

Dr Johannsen?

EMILY

You did the autopsy on Doug Winters?

CORONER

(trying to remember)

Winters -- oh, right, Douglas.

EMILY

How did he die?

CORONER

Family?

EMILY

Friend.

(preempting his reply)

I know the rules -- please, he meant a

lot to me.

57.

CORONER

Compression fracture of the third and

forth vertebrae. Severed his spinal

cord. Actual cause of death was...

suffocation.

EMILY

You're saying he did that to himself?

CORONER

It appears all his injuries were self-

inflicted, yes.

EMILY

Oh come on. He looked like he'd been

beaten to death! Don't tell me he was

some - some suicidal...

(BREAKING DOWN)

...I knew him! He was my best friend!

CORONER

Miss, I would never presume to know your

friend better than you. But the injuries

suggest he was trying to hurt himself.

Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry.

EMILY

Have you ever seen this before, somebody

dying like this?

CORONER

Truly, I am shocked every day by the

violence people do to themselves.

58.

LUCY

You think it's my fault, don't you?

EMILY

It was an accident. It was nobody's

fault.

EMILY

He was scared. He came out of that room

with her, Mike, and he was scared. He

said she threatened him.

BARRON

Listen. You're still in shock. Let's

NOT --

EMILY

Diego said it was a man on the phone.

You know who made that call. There was

no one else in the house.

(off his look)

You think I don't know how crazy this

sounds?!

59.

BARRON

Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a

kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the

most reliable witness.

EMILY

Why is he in that state of mind? Why was

Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she

called him.

BARRON

Emily. I already did. There were no

calls from your house.

EMILY

Her mother and father, their bedroom door

has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two

of `em... Something came through that

door and they didn't want it ever coming

through there again.

CUT TO:

INTERVIEWER

And by forcing your daughter into the

oven, can you tell me, what did you think

the outcome would be?

MARGARET

You mean what were we doing it for?

INTERVIEWER

Yes.

60.

MARGARET

To kill her.

INTERVIEWER

Why?

MARGARET

God's will.

INTERVIEWER

And why was it God's will that you should

kill your daughter?

INTERVIEWER

Why is that funny, Margaret?

MARGARET

`Cause she's not my daughter.

INTERVIEWER

You're her mother...?

MARGARET

I bore her, but she's not mine.

INTERVIEWER

Help me understand. If you and Edward

are Lucy's biological parents, how can

she not be yours?

MARGARET

`Cause she's not Of us.

INTERVIEWER

Not Of you?

INTERVIEWER

Who is she Of?

MARGARET

Not who, what.

INTERVIEWER

What is she Of?

61.

MARGARET

Stop acting like you don't know what I'm

talking about.

INTERVIEWER

You think your daughter is the devil?

MARGARET

Not him himself, Of him, working in his

name, in his honor.

INTERVIEWER

Evil incarnate?

MARGARET

I don't care what you call it.

INTERVIEWER

And why do you think that?

MARGARET

Not what I think it's what I know.

INTERVIEWER

How do you know this? Could you give me

an example?

MARGARET

She can make you see things. Visions.

INTERVIEWER

Visions of what?

MARGARET

Hell. Damnation. Whatever you're afraid

of.

INTERVIEWER

I see. Any other `special abilities'?

MARGARET

People die around her, is that a special

ability?

INTERVIEWER

She kills people?

62.

MARGARET

Not by her hand, they just die. I had

two brothers, Brent and Travis...

MARGARET

...and I mean they was healthy boys,

healthy as can be. Eddie, three sisters.

Soon as she was born they started dying.

INTERVIEWER

You blame Lucy for their deaths?

INTERVIEWER

Why do you imagine you were spared?

MARGARET

I guess she couldn't get rid of us till

she found somebody else. Now that she

has, I don't imagine we're long for this

world.

CUT TO:

EDWARD

THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!

INTERVIEWER

Edward, please calm --

EDWARD

YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN QUESTIONS! YOU

DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

EDWARD

IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A

CHILD!

63.

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)

Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a

rather severe psychotic episode last

night...

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST

...Woke up screaming, absolutely

convinced she was on fire. She wasn't,

of course, they managed to sedate her.

But it's curious, she displays all the

symptoms of a burn patient. Except the

burns themselves...

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST

In no condition for visitors as you can

see. If you'd like, I could let you see

Mr Sheridan?

EMILY

Okay.

64.

EMILY

I know I'm probably the last person you

want to see right now, but you're...

EMILY

You're the only one I can talk to.

Lucy's been staying with me -

EDWARD

Who died?

EMILY

A friend.

EMILY

I, ummm...

EDWARD

You're scared.

EDWARD

You oughta be.

EDWARD

You judged us before you ever walked in

that house. Sat there in our living room

tellin' us about our problems, how to be

better parents - certain of everything

and dead wrong about all of it.

(THEN)

Ask what you came to ask.

65.

EMILY

What is she?

EDWARD

Can tell you what she's not. She not a

daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year-

old having trouble in school. She's not

some innocent victim whose door you

busted down and life you saved. And

she's not going no place, lady, till

she's good and done with you.

EMILY

Done with me how?

EDWARD

However she wants. You think it's an

accident her ending up with you? She saw

you coming a mile away.

EMILY

Why me? I don't have anything.

EDWARD

You have that you're good. Kindness.

Decency. That's what she feeds on.

Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We

were a big family, she went through us

like a wrecking ball. And you know,

every time something happened, every

time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't

her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to

yourself than think bad things about your

baby girl. But finally we got to a point

where me and Maggy looked at each other -

(remembers so clearly)

- where we looked at each other and we

was out of lies, both of us. Most

terrifying moment of our lives. And

that's where you are now.

EDWARD

I'll tell you this. She sees everything.

And what she doesn't see she just sort of

senses it, like when you call a friend

and they pick up before it rings?

(MORE)

66.

EDWARD(CONT'D)

Only time you got the upper hand is when

she's sleepin' but she almost never does.

We checked on her every night for three

months. Every twenty minutes, up and

down those stairs. First time she slept

was the night you kicked in my front

door.

EMILY

What does she want?

EDWARD

To know... what your idea of hell is...

and make you live there.

EDWARD

I'm not a hateful man. I look at you and

I wish I could tell you you're through

the worst of it. That it's gonna work

out for you in the end. I wish I could.

EMILY

What should I do?

EDWARD

How strong's your faith?

EMILY

Nancy...?

NANCY

Emily, I heard about Doug. I'm so sorry.

EMILY

(NODS)

Do you have a minute?

67.

NANCY

How's it working out with the Sheridan

girl?

EMILY

Actually, that's why I'm here. I

appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I

really do, but I think it'd be best if

she was placed in foster care.

NANCY

She is. You're it.

EMILY

I know, but it's not working out.

NANCY

Playing mommy isn't the laugh-a-minute

you were hoping, huh?

EMILY

I suppose not.

NANCY

Sorry, you petitioned for custody, you

got it. She's your responsibility.

EMILY

Until when?

NANCY

Till we find a suitable foster home.

EMILY

How long is that going to take?

NANCY

You're asking me questions you know the

answer to. Three to six weeks. Surely

you can manage that long.

EMILY

I don't want her anymore. I'm done.

That's it.

NANCY

Now you look. I put my reputation, quite

possibly my career, on the line for you.

Don't embarrass me. You make this work.

68.

EMILY

How do I make it work if it's not

working?

NANCY

However! Find a way!

HARDWARE CLERK

That what you're looking for?

EMILY

(NODS)

Thanks.

LUCY

69.

LUCY

Hi.

EMILY

Hi.

LUCY

You weren't there so I took the bus.

EMILY

Sorry, work - lost track of time.

LUCY

It's okay, I know how busy you are.

LUCY

Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops

right at the end of the street. So I can

always get home, whether you're there or

not.

70.

EMILY

Lucky.

LUCY

Where's the phone?

EMILY

Oh, it wasn't working...

LUCY

Wow. That one, too.

LUCY

Can I have a shower? We had gym today...

LUCY

Are they being nice to her?

EMILY

Who?

LUCY

My mother.

EMILY

How - how would I know that?

LUCY

I thought you said you were going to see

her.

EMILY

I never said that.

LUCY

Hm. I must have dreamt it.

71.

EMILY

I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find

somewhere that will take her. Tonight.

I don't want this girl in my house.

FEET

LUCY

Good night.

72.

BARRON

Emily...?

EMILY

Mike.

EMILY

`No such thing as a bad kid, only bad

parents.' I always believed that. It's

a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.

BARRON

You wanna end up where they did keep

talking like this.

(off her look)

I'm not judging you. You're grieving for

Doug and you're still confused about what

Diego did.

EMILY

Aren't you?

BARRON

Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw

violence and he repeated it, that's the

cycle, you know that better than anyone.

73.

EMILY

Why did she lie about calling him?

BARRON

`Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean

she made him do it. Look, let me tell

you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged

child, a deceitful child, a manipulative

child. But a damaged, deceitful,

manipulative child is not a demon. Ask

my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of

`em.

EMILY

Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run

away from something just because it

scares you.

BARRON

I stopped you on the steps. I think

maybe you oughta go all the way in.

74.

NANCY

Who do you think you are barging in there

like that?!

EMILY

I don't want her in group anymore, I

don't want her around the other kids.

NANCY

Well that's not your decision, is it?!

LUCY

It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a

lot of stress lately, but she's really

nice to me and I hope I can stay with her

a really long time.

NANCY

We'll talk about this later.

LUCY

See you next week, Nancy.

EMILY

You're never going back there.

LUCY

Why, Emily?

75.

LUCY

Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

LUCY

Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

EMILY

W-w-what's happening - ?!

LUCY

Can I go back to group next week?

EMILY

You're never going back there!

LUCY

Are you sure?

FOLLOWS:

EMILY

No...

76.

DISTINCT

LUCY

I can see you.

77.

LUCY

Don't be sad. This is your new

beginning.

EMILY

Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let -

that's not what I said - no, I did not -

you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will

you let me respond? - will you let me -

Mrs Lynch - will you let -

EMILY

SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE

WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME

OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU

BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS!

THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND

SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!

78.

WAYNE

Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any

personal days. Come on, you look like

crap, go home.

EMILY

I don't want to go home.

BECCA

Emily...

EMILY

I know I haven't been a great friend

lately, but... do you think maybe I could

crash here for a couple of nights?

BECCA

Sure, when?

EMILY

Tonight and tomorrow.

BECCA

Em, any other weekend you know I'd say

yes, but I just met this guy and he's

coming over tonight like for the night

and it might be, you know, kinda weird.

79.

LUCY (O.S.)

Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared...

LUCY (O.S.)

Emily? Please? I know you're in there,

please...?

LUCY (O.S.)

Please, Emily...

LUCY (O.S.)

LET ME IN!

LUCY (O.S.)

LET ME IN!

LUCY (O.S.)

Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me

in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let

me in, let me in, let me in...

EMILY

LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

MARGARET SHERIDAN

EMILY

Help me! Please!

EMILY

Let me on!

EMILY

She's coming! Please!

EMILY

BUS DRIVER

There's nobody out there.

82.

EMILY

DRIVE!

BUS DRIVER

There - is - nobody - out - there!

BOYFRIEND

(re: the office space)

No, I like it. It's like those things

they put baby cows in to make veal -

WAYNE

What?

EMILY

WAYNE

Em...?

WAYNE

Emily...?

83.

WAYNE

Jesus - are you okay?

EMILY

(HOARSE WHISPER)

I... I had some things to catch up on...

WAYNE

You look like shit, you need to see a

doctor.

EMILY

I saw a doctor.

WAYNE

What did they say?

EMILY

(LOSES IT)

They said mind your own fucking business!

EMILY

Wayne...?

84.

EMILY

Hello...?

85.

EMILY

Robin...

ROBIN

What are you doing here so late? I tried

calling you. I found someone to take

Lucy.

EMILY

(STUNNED RELIEF)

You did?

ROBIN

Anaheim couple. They've helped us out

before.

EMILY

(under her breath)

Oh God...

ROBIN

What's the matter?

EMILY

I can't. I'm keeping her.

86.

EMILY

If I get rid of her, if I put her into

the system...

EDWARD

(NODS YUP)

She starts all over again somewhere else.

Can't let her stay, can't let her go.

That leaves you with one option.

EMILY

I can't, Edward, I --

EDWARD

You have to. You have to find the

strength. Don't you understand? That's

why she's doing this. To test you. Test

your faith.

EMILY

I don't have any faith.

EDWARD

How `bout anger. Got some of that?

EMILY

How... how do I...?

EDWARD

Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you

can...

(THEN; THINKING)

Tell you what I'd do different. Count

myself dead at the outset. Accept that

going in and use it to my advantage.

That's the one thing I don't think she'd

see coming, someone giving up their own

life to take hers.

87.

EMILY

(calls through door)

Mike...?

THE TELEVISION

EDWARD

Where is she now? Some family somewhere?

INTERVIEWER

Why does that concern you, Edward?

EDWARD

`Cause you have to warn them.

LUCY

I like it here. I like you. You want me

to like you, don't you?

88.

LUCY

You have to do what I say. If I say I

want to go to group, you have to do it.

If I say I want a new dress, you have to

do it. If I say I want ice cream every

day after school, you have to do it.

Okay?

LUCY

They did what I said for a while and then

they stopped and started with the

secrets. But they weren't really secrets

I guess...

(looks at Emily)

...because I always knew what they were

thinking.

MARGARET

Don't leave me.

YOUNG NURSE

It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you

later.

Twenty years in the trenches, can't make

Lieutenant? Hurts, doesn't it? Shakes

your faith sometimes. You know why they

keep passing you over? Do you, Michael?

`Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft...

91.

BARRON

You're right. She called Doug. Took me

an extra couple of days to get your cell

phone records. That's what she's been

using.

EMOTION:

EMILY

She's taking me apart, Mike.

BARRON

I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of

this.

EMILY

(re: Edward's photo)

He told me I have to kill her.

BARRON

I'll help you.

BARRON

Whatever it takes.

BARRON

I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel.

Keep her at the house.

DOCTOR

Physically you're fine. How's the

stress?

EMILY

I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could

give me something.

92.

DOCTOR

Take one of these, you'll sleep.

Why won't you tell me what's going on?

I have to go.

What did you do to him?

EMILY

WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

LUCY

He did it to himself.

LUCY

Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The

astronomy tests today.

EMILY

Get out of my house.

98.

GET OUT!

LUCY

Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to

Can I come in so we can talk and work it

out?

That was mean.

LUCY

Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming

LUCY

It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed

on. How people do to their own kids what

their parents did to them. That's why

you got the job...

LUCY
