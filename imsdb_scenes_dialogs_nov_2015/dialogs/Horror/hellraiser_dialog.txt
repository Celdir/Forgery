2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

CENOBITE

(unseen)

It's over ...

3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY

LARRY

It's one of these.

JULIA

We're going to freeze to death.

LARRY

0.K.  0.K.

JULIA

Maybe somebody changed the lock.

LARRY

(slightly irritated)

Like who?

JULIA

Just a thought -

LARRY

Ah!

LARRY

Success.

Voila!

LARRY

Well.  This is it.

JULIA

How long since you were here?

LARRY

The best part of ten years.

LARRY

I wanted to sell it off at

one point, after the old Lady

died, but I couldn't get Frank

to agree.

LARRY

(with pleasure)

Christ.  It's not been touched.

LARRY

Look at this.

JULIA

Why didn't he want to sell it?

LARRY

(dismissively)

I don't know. Probably wanted

a hideaway.

Look at this stuff.

JULIA

Not exactly modern.

LARRY

(shrugs)

We'll sell it.  Sell everything.

JULIA

I thought half of it was your

brother's?

LARRY

He won't complain.  He can pay

off some of his creditors.

LARRY

You know we have to let Kirsty

see this place, before we do

anything to it.  She'll love it.

JULIA

You mean we're moving in?

LARRY

You don't like it?

JULIA

It's better than Brooklyn.

LARRY

You're still blaming me.

JULIA

No.  I'm not.

LARRY

You wanted to come back to

London.  We came back.

JULIA

All right.

LARRY

So what's the argument?

JULIA

No argument.

Oh Christ.  Julia ...

Quite sure.

JULIA

Well?

FRANK

Better.  Much better.  I'd

like some clothes.  And maybe

a cigarette.

JULIA

Then you tell me ... you

explain what happened to you?

FRANK

Of course.

101  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

FRANK (O.S.)

I wanted access to experiences ...

pleasures ... that only they

could offer ...

JULIA (O.S.)

The Cenobites.

FRANK

That's what they call themselves.

They're not human.  Maybe they

were once, but they're not now.

They rearrange their own flesh

for pleasure.

JULIA

And the box?

FRANK

It cost me a fortune.  All I

had.  It's a puzzle you see.

You solve it, and the Cenobites

come through ...

JULIA

Where from?

FRANK

God knows.  Sometimes I think

they're just behind the walls ...

JULIA

So they cheated you

FRANK

Oh no.  They kept to their

bargain.  They gave me

experiences I'd never forget ...

FRANK

But their pleasure was my pain.

FRANK

Terrible pain.  Appalling ...

My body was forfeit.  But my

spirit ... they left that here.

In the boards.  In the walls.

Watching the world, but never

able to touch it ...

JULIA

And the blood let you out?

FRANK

There are ways to resurrection.

Blood's one of them.  I won't

let them take me back, Julia.

FRANK

I want to be whole, and then

get out -

I won't let them take me.

JULIA

You won't have to.  We'll be

gone.  Somewhere they'll

never find us.

Not in the whole wide world.

102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

LARRY

Is this upsetting you?

JULIA

I've seen worse.

LARRY

Are you all right?

JULIA

Fine.

104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

COMMENTATOR

- and now he's in trouble,

he's really in trouble -

LARRY

What was that?

JULIA

Thunder.

LARRY

No.  Something else.

JULIA

Maybe I left a window open -

- I'll go see.

LARRY

No.  I'll do it.

105  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

106  INT.   STAIRWAY   NIGHT

JULIA

It was nothing.

Larry ...

LARRY

What's wrong with you?

JULIA

I just hate the thunder.

LARRY

I'm here.

You're shaking.

There's nothing to be afraid

of.

I'll just go check upstairs ...

LARRY

Oh baby.

JULIA

Don't go upstairs.

LARRY

Come with me then.

JULIA

Please ...

107  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

JULIA

Don't.

LARRY

We must have rats.

LARRY

See?  Quite safe.

Let's go  down.  I'll make it

better.

108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

LARRY

... oh babe ...

LARRY

...I love you, honey ... let

me ... oh God ... I love you ...

LARRY

Oh baby ... I love you ...

JULIA

... no ...

JULIA

No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE.

No.

LARRY

(looks at her)

Huh?

JULIA

Please ...

LARRY

What's wrong with you?

JULIA

(almost sobbing)

Please.  I can't bear it ...

LARRY

I don't understand you.  One

moment you're all over me, the

next it's:  Don't touch me.

I just don't understand.

109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING

LARRY

... maybe we should never

have come back.

KIRSTY

Maybe you should give it some

time.

LARRY

I guess.

KIRSTY

(skirting her real

feelings)

She's not like Mom.  She's ...

I don't know ... moody.  I thought

that was what you liked about her.

LARRY

You don't like her at all do you?

KIRSTY

I don't know her.  She's so ...

sealed up.

If YOU love her she must be

worth loving.  Just give me

some time.

LARRY

She doesn't even want to leave

the house.

KIRSTY

Really?

LARRY

It's like she's waiting for

something.

KIRSTY

What?

LARRY

I don't know.  I don't know.

It's beyond me.

LARRY

(hesitant)

Would you ... maybe call round

sometime?  Try to make friends.

KIRSTY

Sure.

LARRY

Maybe all she needs is some

company.

110  INT.   STAIRCASE   DAY

FRANK

You can't love him.

JULIA

I don't.

FRANK

So where's the harm?

Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ,

what have you done with her.

FRANK

Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's

Uncle Frank.

KIRSTY

No.

FRANK

You remember.

KIRSTY

No.

FRANK

Come to Daddy.

KIRSTY

No.  Get the fuck off me.

FRANK

You've grown.  You're beautiful.

KIRSTY

Don't touch me.  Or so help

me -

FRANK

What?  What will you do?  What

can you do?

(pause)

There's nothing to be frightened

of.

FRANK

I bet you make your Daddy proud,

don't you?  Beautiful.

KIRSTY

This isn't happening.

FRANK

I used to tell myself that.

Used to try and pretend I was

dreaming all the pain.  But why

kid yourself?  Some things have

to be endured.  Take it from me.

And that makes the pleasures so

much sweeter ...

FRANK

Give that to me.

KIRSTY

(breathless)

No.

FRANK

One last time.  Give me the

box.

KIRSTY

You want it?

Fucking have it!

141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

NURSE

You're awake.

I'll get the doctor.

DOCTOR

(approaching the bed)

So ... you're back with us.

KIRSTY

I think so.

DOCTOR

How are you feeling?

KIRSTY

Tender.

DOCTOR

You took quite a beating.  Do

you remember what happened?

KIRSTY

I want to speak to my father ...

DOCTOR

(nods)

Of course.  We'll bring you a

telephone.

Maybe this'll jog your memory.

I had the Devil's own job

getting it out of your hand.

Does it ring any bells?

Do you want it left?

KIRSTY

Why not?

DOCTOR

Chin up.  There's no serious

damage.  And you're safe here.

KIRSTY

Um.

142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

JULIA

She'll tell them everything ...

FRANK

I don't think so.  She'll want

Larry first.

JULIA

That's probably her now.  Or

the police.

FRANK

Maybe.

JULIA

Don't you care?

FRANK

There's very little I can do

about it.

JULIA

Maybe we should just leave -

FRANK

Like this?  Look at me! LIKE

THIS?

JULIA

Well we can't just stay here -

FRANK

I need a skin.  Then we leave -

143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

NURSE

Comfortable?

KIRSTY

(smiles)

Sure.

NURSE

Any luck with your father?

KIRSTY

(shakes her head)

He's probably got a meeting.

I called a friend of mine.  He's

coming; is that O.K.?

NURSE

Of course.

KIRSTY

Where the hell did you come from?

CENOBITE

The box ... you opened it.

We came.

KIRSTY

It's just a puzzle box.

CENOBITE

It's a means to summon us -

it's called the Lament Con-

figuration.

KIRSTY

Who are you?

CENOBITE

Cenobites.  Explorers in the

further regions of experience.

Demons to some.  Angels to

others.

KIRSTY

Well, I didn't mean to open

that thing.  You can go back

wherever you came from.

FEMALE CENOBITE

We can't.   Not alone.

KIRSTY

This isn't for real.

CENOBITE

You solved the box.  We came.

Now you must come with us.

Taste our pleasures.

KIRSTY

Don't touch me!

KIRSTY

Steve.  Thank God you came.

STEVE

What happened to you?

KIRSTY

These THINGS ... they want to

take me -

STEVE

What things?

CENOBITE

(to Kirsty)

He doesn't see us, or hear us.

We belong to you, Kirsty.  And

you to us.

KIRSTY

No!

STEVE

What's wrong?

KIRSTY

Don't let them take me, Steve -

STEVE

I won't let anybody take you.

FEMALE CENOBITE

If he takes another step, we

open his throat.

KIRSTY

(to Steve)

Please go, Steve.

STEVE

What?

KIRSTY

Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K.

I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll

look after me -

STEVE

(protesting)

What did I say?

KIRSTY

Will you GO, damn you?

STEVE

I'll come back later, huh?

KIRSTY

Sure.  Why not?

STEVE

'Bye.

KIRSTY

'Bye.

FEMALE CENOBITE

Good.

CENOBITE

It's time we were away.

KIRSTY

(almost crying)

Let me alone, will you?

CENOBITE

No tears please.  It's a waste

of good suffering.

KIRSTY

Wait!

CENOBITE

No time for argument.

KIRSTY

You did this before, right?

CENOBITE

Many times.

KIRSTY

To a man called Frank Cotton?

FEMALE CENOBITE

Oh yes.

KIRSTY

But he escaped you.

CENOBITE

Nobody escapes us.

KIRSTY

HE did.  I've seen him.  He's

alive.

CENOBITE

Is that so?   And what are you

proposing?

KIRSTY

I'll take you to him.  Then you

take him instead of me.  Back

wherever you come from.

CENOBITE

Perhaps ...

FEMALE CENOBITE

But if you cheat us ...

CENOBITE

We'll tear your soul apart!

STEVE

She was trembling all over.

NURSE

I'd better go look for her.

STEVE

Maybe she's gone back to her -

What was there to see?

Oh God.  Thank God.

I thought something might have ...

(to Larry)

I have to talk to you.

LARRY

Of course.

LARRY

It's all right, sweetheart.

Julia's told me everything;

and it's all right ...

KIRSTY

No.  You don't understand. Your

brother - Frank - he's here in

the house.  And he's -

LARRY

Whatever Frank did was his error.

And it's finished with now.

KIRSTY

Finished?

LARRY

(smiles)

He's gone.

KIRSTY

Gone?

JULIA

Dead.

LARRY

He was insane, baby:  a mad dog.

I put him out of his misery -

CENOBITE

... we'll tear your soul apart ...

LARRY

I'll go to the police, when I'm

feeling stronger.  Try and find

some way to make them understand,

though God knows I don't really

understand myself.  Did he hurt

you?

LARRY

(leans back)

Poor Frank.  He's better off

dead.

KIRSTY

I don't believe it.

LARRY

I'm afraid it's true.

KIRSTY
