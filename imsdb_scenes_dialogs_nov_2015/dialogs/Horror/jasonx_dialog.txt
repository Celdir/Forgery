JASON X - Revised Rough Draft

OPEN ON:

CUT TO:

FEMALE VOICE

Careful . . .

MALE VOICE

I know.

STONEY

(reading)

Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

ADRIENNE

(smiles)

You thinking what I'm thinking?

ADRIENNE

(breathless)

What about Kkinsa?

STONEY

It's over between us. You're the

only one for me!

STONEY

You okay?

CUT TO:

FAT LOU

(yelling over the wind)

Let's go! Time to load up!

YLLO

(yelling)

I'm missing two!

FAT LOU

Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have

left this rock an hour ago!

BOEMAN

(eyes a device)

North three clicks.

CUT TO:

BOEMAN

(yelling)

There!

KICKER

Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

YLLO

We're missing two of the kids!

KICKER

Get your ass back to the shuttle.

I'll check it out.

YLLO

Not without me!

YLLO

Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming

here for ten years. We never picked this up on

our . . . KAY-EM?

KAY-EM 14

The air's laced with type two ozone,

it reads as a solid.

THORGAN

Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

KAY-EM 14

In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved

their facilities underground to escape . . .

KICKER

All right, all right, enough with the history

lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick

some little punk ass.

KKINSA

I have an idea, why don't you go find

them and we'll get the hell out of here!

KAY-EM 14

Was that out loud?

DELONGPREE

Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

THORGAN

Cool! This is an automatic "A".

AZRAEL

I've got my project. What are you losers

gonna do?

KICKER

Back to the shuttle! All of you!

I'll find them.

YLLO

Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.

These remains are two hundred years old.

BOEMAN

Creepy.

THORGAN

Cool.

KKINSA

Okay, I'm outta here.

YYLO

Kay-Em, any thoughts?

KAY-EM 14

Girth is better than length and

women prefer a shaved scrotum during

oral sex.

THORGAN

I'm trying to give her some personality.

YLLO

Well stop messing with her. I don't want

a science droid with a personality. Now

let's find them and get back. I want to

get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

KKINSA

No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .

I have a life you know.

FAT LOU(V.O.)

Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!

Get your ass back hre!

YLLO

(into radio)

Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.

You won't believe what we found.

(calls out)

Adrienne! Stoney!

BOEMAN

There was a hall of a battle down here.

COMPUTER VOICE

Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

KKINSA

I feel compelled to ask why we are

ignoring that.

DELONGPREE

Damnit!

YLLO

What the hell are you two doing?!

KKINSA

You're toast, mister.

YLLO

You're both toast!

ADRIENNE

You gotta see this!

THORGAN

(re: ceiling)

That's a strange design, don't you think?

KICKER

We don't have time for this shit.

DELONGPREE

Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

ADRIENNE

Check it out.

KKINSA

So don't open the door.

ADRIENNE

Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

YLLO

Is that?

KAY-EM 14

The room's still operational.

She's perfectly preserved.

YLLO

(into radio)

Fat Lou, bring the ship to the

following coordinates. Call Grendel,

have them power up the labs, we're bringing

in the find of the century!

KICKER

Now wait a minute! I don't think you

should open that door.

YLLO

This is a science excursion corporal.

Just stay out of the way.

YLLO

Okay, no screwing around. This is the real

thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan,

open it up.

KKINSA

You're opening the door?

What about the . . . ?

DELONGPREE

I'm thinking we should call in some

experts.

YLLO

This is your find people. You want to

give your credit away?

DELONGPREE

I was just saying . . .

THORGAN

The cryo unit leaked. The computers

sealed the room. No airborne viruses

no hazardous materials. I've shut down the

until. Alright, stand back.

KAY-EM 14

Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses

will render you unconcious.

DELONGPREE

Knock you on your ass pal.

YLLO

Kay-Em!

DELONGPREE

I speak on behalf of the group

when I say . . . that's fucked.

KAY-EM 14

Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .

34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick

shit house.

YLLO

Thorgan?!!!

THORGAN

Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

KAY-EM 14

Time of hibernation 2049.

Crystallization at seventeen percent.

Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of

rejuvenation eight-one percent.

KKINSA

What's going on?

DELONGPREE

She's dying.

JANESSA

Bitch looks dead to me.

SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)

Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass

back to the shuttle!!

YLLO

Janessa, stretcher.

(into radio)

Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have

a medical emergency here not tot mention the

discovery of a lifetime.

SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)

Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

KICKER

We're outta here!

YLLO

Fine, grab that end.

THORGAN

Hey check this out!

THORGAN

This caused the leak and there's an

occupant.

KICKER

Don't touch that!

KKINSA

This is bad, no?

THORGAN

Relax, it's only a  glitch in the

system.

JANESSA

First field trip and you think

you're a Scientist. Move out of the

way geek.

DELONGPREE

Jesus, used to make the suckers big

didn't they?

KAY-EM 14

Subject was dead prior to incubation.

YLLO

My God, look at him. Why would they freeze

a dead body?

(a beat)

Alright, load him up, and let's get out

of here!

BOEMAN

Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

AZRAEL

Cool . . . check out my arm.

YLLO

Kicker!

KICKER

Defense droids. I'm on it.

KKINSA

There goes prom night.

KICKER

They're only class two. I can

handle this. No problem.

AZRAEL

Not a problem?!

AZRAEL

I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-

(re:shot)

Oh, that's dreamy.

JANESSA

Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.

I gotta date tonight.

KICKER

Stand back!

YLLO

We have to get these two back in one piece!

KAY-EM 14

Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization

immediately.

YLLO

Kicker! Do something!

ADRIENNE

Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

AZRAEL

(drugged up)

That is soooo cool!

KICKER

Come on!

KKINSA

Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

KICKER

We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!

Teach, find a way out!

BOEMAN

I'm on it!

KICKER

Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

BOEMAN

(re: gadget)

Left at the end of the hall!

THORGAN

(reading from device)

They're not after us. Their sensors are

locked in on . . . him!

KICKER

Leave him behind!

YLLO

No! He's coming with us!

BOEMAN

Here. We're one meter from the surface!

KICKER

Then duck.

DELONGPREE

It's too high!

KICKER

Make it happen!

JANESSA

They're just subclass B droids.

I'm so not impressed.

BOEMAN

Stoney, you catch.

BOEMAN

We're clear! Let's go!

KICKER

They've got me! Let go!

BOEMAN

No!

BOEMAN

That wasn't so bad.

KICKER

(yells)

This will be!

THORGAN

Nice touch.

BOEMAN

And you said high school was boring.

FAT LOU

Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

YLLO

Just get us to the ship!

AZRAEL

Oh shit I forgot my arm!

ADRIENNE

Here. Dumbass.

CUT TO:

FAT LOU

This is Beowulf approaching from

sector fifteen.

BERNIE(V.O.)

I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.

And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

BRODSKI

What the hell were you thinking?

YLLO

Get them in the lab!

BRODSKI

Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

YLLO

(to the grunts)

Back off!

YLLO

(back to the kids)

Get them to the labs . . . Now!

YLLO

What the hell are you doing?

BRODSKI

My god! This is way over your head, pal.

We need to call some experts and . . .

YLLO

I am an expert!

BRODSKI

You're a teacher.

YLLO

Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.

She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,

she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking

head!

BRODSKI

What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

KAY-EM 14

Subjects scan virus clean . . .

KAY-EM 14

Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

BRODSKI AND YLLO

Thorgan!!

THORGAN

Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

BRODSKI

How do you know that piece of cursed rock down

there doesn't carry something metal tits can't

detect?

YLLO

Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

BRODSKI

Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

YLLO

I don't give a shit. This one's prime for

decryonization. We're brining her back.

BRODSKI

I still think we should send for a team of

real scientists.

YLLO

I am a scientist you asshole! This could be

the most important discovery in 400 years. Do

you have any idea what a find like this could

mean?

BRODSKI

Right now, I care only for the safety of this

crew. You don't know anything about these two -

BRODSKI

Jesus what the hell is that?

YLLO

That's exactly what we need to find out.

Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you

where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.

I have a medical emergency to deal with.

AZRAEL

Watch it punk, I'm armed.

DALLAS

Punk?

AZRAEL

You'll pay for that.

CUT TO:

BERNIE

Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

FAT LOU

(into radio)

Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

GRENDEL'S MOTHER(V.O.)

Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.

See you in two days.

CUT TO:

YLLO

Get her prepped for the soup.

(to Adrienne)

Take the other one to lab two.

ADRIENNE

Yllo, this is my find. My project.

I want to be in here.

YLLO

I know, dear, but this is too big a

discovery. I need you to prep the second

body.

ADRIENNE

But, I want . . .

YLLO

This is a discovery that we will all share.

We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney

go with her.

THORGAN

Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

DELONGPREE

She's beautiful . . .

THORGAN

Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

ADRIENNE

Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.

This is my find!

STONEY

You know even though we both found this guy ,

I'll let you take the credits. You can take it

from here.

ADRIENNE

Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another

dissection. You'll only get in my way.

STONEY

Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

YLLO

Hands on training is rare. You should consider

yourself lucky.

AZRAEL

Lucky?!

AZRAEL

Another hour and I'd have lost

the arm.

JANESSA

Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

AZRAEL

I better get extra credit for this shit.

YLLO

Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

DELONGPREE

(swallows hard)

I'm Okay.

STONEY

Well she's definitely a blond.

JANESSA

Oh that's scientific.

DELONGPREE

You think all girls from the past

looked this good?

JANESSA

She's not that great.

THORGAN

400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

YLLO

Okay, people, we need to Learn everything

there is to learn about our two guests. And

if all goes well, I'll mention each one of

you when I make my nobel prize speech.

DELONGPREE

(underbreath)

Yeah, right.

THORGAN

Everything looks good.

YLLO

Turn up the heat.

ADRIENNE

Done. Crystallization remains

seventeen percent.

COMPUTER VOICE

Crystallization at sixty percent

Subject classification . . . deformity.

ADRIENNE

Put it on the screen.

ADRIENNE(V.O.)

(over speaker)

Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

ADRIENNE(V.O.)

Look at the brain.

JANESSA

It's just like Thorgan's.

What do you think this means?

THORGAN

This is what it means right here.

JANESSA

Small brains make your balls itch?

DELONGPRE

And what's with the headgear?

KAY-EM 14

The mask is an artifact from a

sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

BOEMAN

Hockey.

KAY-EM 14

A medieval sport where two teams

club one another with elongated

sticks. Very sexy.

YLLO

What do you expect from a culture that

sucked its planet dry of resources.

KKINSA

This bores me.

DELONGPRE

She's red. Body temp 98.6. This

is so cool.

YLLO

Prep defib and start the cell

reconstruction.

THORGAN

Cool!

YLLO

Is she stable?

KAY-EM 14

Subject is stable and cell

reconstruction has begun.

DELONGPRE

Now what?

YLLO

We wait. I need about fifteen.

Call me if there are any changes.

If she farts I want a full report.

AZRAEL

Don't I deserve a sick day or some

shit like that?

CUT TO:

KKINSA

Adrienne?! Of all people!

STONEY

You're jealous.

KKINSA

Adrienne?!

STONEY

It's over between us. You're the

one I want.

KKINSA

Bed!

CUT TO:

ADRIENNE

Prepare organ vats.

ADRIENNE

Okay big boy . . .

ADRIENNE

(continuing)

. . . let's see what you're made of.

CUT TO:

JANESSA

All this science shit, makes me horny.

(removes her shirt)

Take off your cloths, we don't have much

time.

JANESSA

You're quicker than usual.

YLLO

Later.

JANESSA

You prefer an apple?

YLLO

(to console)

Secure line. Perez, Joshua,

Solaras Space Lab. Connect.

PEREZ

You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

YLLO

We just left old Earth. You'll never believe

what we found.

YLLO

I'm sending you the files.

PEREZ

(testy)

Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient

Farrari . . .

YLLO

Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.

See what kind of payday we're looking at.

PEREZ

(begins download)

Alright, I'm . . .

(reacts to file)

No way . . . is this a joke?

CUT TO:

YLLO

Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

PEREZ(V.O.)

If you're for real, you're looking at a million

credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include

touring and guest lectures. When can you get them

here?

YLLO

I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

PEREZ(V.O.)

See you then . . . doctor.

QUICK CUT TO:

KKINSA

How bad do you want it?

ADRIENNE

Interesting. Record. Thawing has

caused possible muscle spasms.

KKINSA

Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

QUICK CUT TO:

THORGAN

Anybody seen the reticulator?

DELONGPRE

Try next door, there was one there

yesterday.

THORGAN

Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's

gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling

around instead of working.

THORGAN

Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

YLLO

All right, lets do this. Thorgan

begin the Defib program, Delongpre,

ready the drainage units. Boerman get the

others in here.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

We've got a heartbeat!

KKINSA

No shit, we've got a heart beat!

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Stoney, you copy? She's awake.

You coming?

STONEY

Hell yeah I'm coming!

KKINSA

No . . . not yet!

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Yes, right now!

STONEY

YES !!!

KKINSA

NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

STONEY

YES!!!!!!

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Stoney, put your pants on and get

your ass down here!

YLLO

It's time.

DELONGPRE

What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

YLLO

I've waited long enough.

Kay . . . you know what to do.

YLLO

What the hell are you doing?

BRODSKI

My job.

YLLO

Fine, just stay out of my way.

(turns to Kay)

Hit it.

SMASH CUT TO:

GIRL'S VOICE

Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

RIZZO

Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

RIZZO(O.S.)

Hey!

RIZZO

You son of a bitch!

COMPUTER VOICE

Cryo-Unit activated.

COMPUTER VOICE

Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.

Security measures on line.

RIZZO

Nooooooo!

RIZZO

Somebody! No!

COMPUTER VOICE

Subject in computer unit has reached

full incubation.

RIZZO

No . . .

THORGAN

That one did it!

YLLO

We should expect a moment of

disorientation.

DELONGPRE

Spunky . . .

YLLO

She broke my fucking nose!

KAY-EM 14

Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

BRODSKI

I like her already.

KAY-EM 14

Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal -

RIZZO

Where..? Who . . .?

(shock)

I'm alive. You brought me back.

YLLO

(rubbing his nose)

Obviously so.

RIZZO

What the hell is this shit?

RIZZO

How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

YLLO

Nanotechnology.

RIZZO

Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

YLLO

We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

RIZZO

30? How long was I out?

YLLO

The year is 2455. You've been frozen

for the past four hundred years.

YLLO

Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some

questions...

RIZZO

JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

THORGAN

The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

RIZZO

Hockey player? He's not a ...

THORGAN

He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

RIZZO

Old Earth?

YLLO

We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a

few questions.

RIZZO

But...I...400 years?

YLLO

That's right, now if you could...

DELONGPRE

It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

YLLO

Wait a minute...I need...

BRODSKI

Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

DELONGPRE

Come on.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Rizzo?

RIZZO

Yeah?

DELONGPRE

I thought that after 400 hundred years,

you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

DELONGPRE

You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran

transport.

It's basically a school bus. We're on our way

back to Earth II.

It's finals week.

RIZZO

You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

DELONGPRE

(a beat)

Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

DELONGPRE

I'll give you a moment alone. Do you

want me to come get you when we start

the dissection?

YLLO

Well?

DELONGPRE

She needs a little time.

YLLO

More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

DELONGPRE

That's really funny.

YLLO

I'd want her statements before we reach porch.

Jesus, women.

DELONGPRE

Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything

she went through?

RIZZO(O.S.)

Dissection?

RIZZO

Jason? He's on this ship?!

YLLO

Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in

400 years...except for you, of course. Look if

you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking

and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the

publicity.

RIZZO

(glares)

Are you finished?

YLLO

God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

DELONGPRE

Oh I like her a lot.

BRODSKI

I'm with you kid.

RIZZO

Where is he?

BRODSKI

(points)

Lab two, relax. What's the matter?

He's dead.

RIZZO

No, you're dead! You're all dead!

YLLO

Jesus!

JANESSA

Oh my God! Adrienne?

THORGAN

What have you done?

RIZZO

What have I done?! Idiots.

BOEMAN

(into a mike)

Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an

emergency!

DELONGPRE

Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

RIZZO

I'll tell you where he is. He's walking

around this ship, killing anything that

moves.

JANESSA

Maybe she tripped.

BRODSKI

Jesus, God!

KICKER

Oh man, what the hell happened?

RIZZO

Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

YLLO

Impossible! He was dead before he entered

Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could

be alive.

RIZZO

I didn't say he was alive.

CUT TO:

DALLAS

That's nine to four, geek-boy.

AZRAEL

You got lucky.

DALLAS

You got lucky. I could have waited until he

ate your head.

AZRAEL

Speaking of which, duck!

AZRAEL

What the?!

DALLAS

He's good.

DALLAS

That sucks. Why won't he go down?

AZRAEL

Pause play.

DALLAS

He's not part of the program.

AZRAEL

Hey cool. They brought ancient

hockey guy back to life.

AZRAEL

Hey! We're playing a game here.

Get off the court!

DALLAS

No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

AZRAEL

Asshole that does not count as a kill.

DALLAS

Yes it does.

AZRAEL

Oh, come on!

DALLAS

Okay, enough of this shit.

AZRAEL

Alright, asshole.

AZRAEL(V.O.)

Clear off the court, asshole.

DALLAS

I don't have all day, kid.

AZRAEL

Yeah yeah I better call the labs,

see what the hell is going on.

AZRAEL

(into mike)

Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.

Your guy got out and runined our game.

YLLO

Azrael can you repeat that?

RIZZO

Get him out of there!

AZRAEL

(into mike)

I said the guy in the mask is in here

ruining our game.

AZRAEL

(continuing)

Send someone to the grid to pick

him up. He looks lost.

YLLO

That's impossible.

RIZZO

I told you! Get them out of there!

(grabs mike)

Get out of there! Get out of there now!

AZRAEL

(into mike)

All right fine, we'll head back--

DALLAS

Jesus!

BRODSKI

Dallas! That you? Come back!

DALLAS

(into mike)

Sarge! Get the fuck down here!

We got a real shitstorm in the --

BRODSKI

(into mike)

Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

RIZZO

He's dead. They're both dead. You

don't understand what is on this ship.

This is a being that kills. That's what

he does. That's all he does. And he is very

good at it.

BRODSKI

Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell

me what the hell is going on!

DELONGPRE

Where are you going?

RIZZO

We have to get off this ship.

YLLO

That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

RIZZO

Why don't you get it? He's going to kill

us all!

BRODSKI

I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever

your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

RIZZO

Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...

and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the

only way you're going to live.

DELONGPRE

You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.

We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of

the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more

advanced than what you're used to.

RIZZO

I hope so.

KICKER

Damn. Are they playing?

SVEN

Dallas?! Azrael!

SVEN

Oh shit.

the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

SVEN

Sarge, this is bad. The kid's

His guts are ripped out.

BRODSKI

(over radio)

Dead?

SVEN

Oh yeah.

KICKER

(into radio)

Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got

it to. Real slice and dice. What

should we do?

BRODSKI

Report to weapons. We're going

on a hunt.

KICKER

Roger that.

(to himself)

Time to kick some ass!

SVEN

Sorry!

KICKER

Don't friggen do that!

BRODSKI

Yllo, what's your head count?

YLLO

Looks like we're missing two.

Stone and Kkinsa.

JANESSA

You know, Stoney's done everyone

on this trip but me..what's up with that?

BRODSKI

This place should be safe. Get them

back here. I don't want to be hunting

around and kill one of your kids by accident.

As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

BRODSKI

I need to know what you know about this guy.

RIZZO

Don't go out there. You can't win.

We need to get off this ship. That's

all there is to it.

BRODSKI

Not an option. I'm going to hunt this

son of a bitch down.

BRODSKI

I've been a grunt for fifteen years.

There's not a problem I can't fix with

enough ammunition.

YLLO

Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,

get your ass down to the lab immediately!

(beat)

I'm going to see if I can find them.

KKINSA

Sstoney's dead!

YLLO

ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,

couple of hours no more. Let them take a

look at our friends.

BRODSKI

Not a chance.

YLLO

JUst don't go in there half cocked.

You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and

ask questions later.

BRODSKI

You got that right.

YLLO

This thing could be worth a great deal....

scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats

on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with

you 50/50...

BRODSKI

You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!

If that...that thing is out there, it's

dead! You got it!!!

KICKER

Fuckin A...

BRODSKI

Now get out of our way...get back to the

lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...

we've got a job to do!

YLLO

That bastard! Boemen turn on the

tracking monitors.

RIZZO

Robot huh?

KAY-EM 14

Kay-em 14.

RIZZO

Barbie from hell...

KAY-EM 14

Cybernetics science droid,

fluent in over six...

RIZZO

Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,

now how about you help me get

out of this coffin, Barbie...

KAY-EM 14

I'm afraid I cannot assist.

RIZZO

I'm surrounded by idiots.

KAY-EM 14

You need to get laid!

THORGON

Sorry, I'm working on it.

DELONGPRE

Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

RIZZO

He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

THORGON

(re:monitor)

There's been an unauthorized entrance to the

Cargo Bay.

BRODSKI

Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to

Lab two and cover out backs.

YLLO

(into the mic)

At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

BRODSKI (v.o.)

I'll try.

CUT TO:

BRODSKI

Alright, the teach requests we take this guy

out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

BRODSKI

So after you've killed him, put one in his knee

so we can say we tried.

BRODSKI

Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.

(into headset)

Teach you there?

YLLO

Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

BRODSKI(V.O.)

You just keep an eye out.

YLLO

Yeah yeah. Got it.

BRODSKI

Let's move out.

BRODSKI

Two teams, Port, starboard.

BRODSKI(V.O.)

Kicker, anything?

KICKER(V.O.)

Negative.

THORGAN

Each blip represents a trained killer.

It's men like that fought off the pirates

on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar

moons...

RIZZO

So, you're saying thse guys have like,

lasers and stuff? They could hack him

to pieces?

THORGAN

Exactly.

RIZZO

WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS

KAY-EM 14

E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

BOEMAN

(into mic)

Sergeant, this is Boemen...

BOEMAN(v.o.)

You've lost Condor.

BRODSKI

Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

BRIGGS

He was...he was right here!

BRODSKI

DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

THORGAN

You see that?

BOEMAN

Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed

fuselage.

BRIGGS

Got it.

BRIGGS

I don't see anything.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

He's right there! In front of you!

BRIGGS

That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should

stay out of this.

BRIGGS(V.O.)

He doesn't show up on...

THORGAN

(turns)

Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

BOEMAN

Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

KICKER

Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

BRODSKI

Teach! Where the hell are you?!

Where's our visuals?!!

YLLO

Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the

Solaras Space Lab.

FAT LOU(V.O.)

I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

YLLO

We've got a situation here! Just do

as  you're told!

FAT LOU(V.O.)

Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon

as we've passed Tara's rings we'll

make the course correction.

YLLO

Thank you.

YLLO

(into mic)

Ok Sarge, what's your status?

BRODSKI(V.O.)

wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three

men and your worthless fuck! After I

kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!

YLLO

But I didn't see...

SVEN(V.O.)

I got him! I got him!

THORGAN

Yes!

RIZZO

Listen up duck fuckers, you can't

kill this thing.

BOEMAN

Duck fuckers?

RIZZO

He's either unconcious or playing dead,

whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,

you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

DELONGPRE

Outta here?

RIZZO

Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?

Something?

THORGON

There's a shuttle.

RIZZO

Alright, been nice knowing you.

Who's with me?

KKINSA

I'll go.

BOEMEN

Yllo said stay here.

KKINSA

Fuck Yllo!

BOEMEN

They got him! You're not leaving!

SVEN

Big sucker too.

BRODSKI

Kicker? Where are you?

RIZZO

Do something!!!

THORGON

Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

BRODSKI

Find Crutch! Set up an ion field

around the cargo bay. We'll torch

the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

YLLO

Sergeant!

BRODSKI

(stops)

What?

YLLO

Nothing.

RIZZO

Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna

get home safely then we get off this boat.

KKINSA

I don't understand...what does he want?

RIZZO

He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone

on this ship.

RIZZO

Any questions?

YLLO

You're not going anywhere.

RIZZO

You wanna die?

YLLO

(ignores her)

Are we locked down?

BOEMAN

That door's the only way in or out and it

won't open without the code.

YLLO

Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab

in less than an hour.

RIZZO

What good will that do?

YLLO

They can deal with this sort of thing.

RIZZO

More soldiers?

YLLO

Scientists. Very intellegent men.

RIZZO

That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's

ass at a spelling bee!

JANESSA

Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out

and let us handle this?

YLLO

Try to calm down. Just think, you're going

to be famous!

RIZZO

(to kids)

Guys, please come with me!

YLLO

4You're not going anywhere.

DELONGPRE

Now hold on! We should hear her out!

THORGAN

She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

YLLO

Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

DELONGPRE

No shit. I got no problem with that.

THORGAN

Maybe if we knew a little bit more about

what we're delaing with here...

RIZZO

tNighty-night.

CRUTCH

Leave her be.

RIZZO

Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

RIZZO

Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.

Come with me.

THORGAN

Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?

We'll die oout there.

RIZZO

How do you open the damn door?

YLLO

You're crazy!

DELONGPRE

Rizzo, he's out there.

RIZZO

Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.

(looks at Delongpre)

Last chance.

RIZZO

Fine. Bye.

YLLO

(favoring his nose)

Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.

The guys at Space Lab have the necessary

equipment to contain this thing and then we

can study it.

YLLO

Computer on line.

JANESSA(O.S.)

What are you doing?

YLLO

(jumps)

Jesus! Can't you knock?

(back to console)

Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

COMPUTER VOICE

Power to Beowulf disengaged.

YLLO

(to Janessa)

She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.

CUT TO:

FAT LOU

Disengage auto-pilot.

BERNIE

Disengaged.

FAT LOU

New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.

BERNIE

On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds.

FAT LOU

Engage auto pilot.

BERNIE

En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

CUT TO:

RIZZO

Which way?

KKINSA

What?

RIZZO

Ssh.

RIZZO

He's in here.

RIZZO

You scream I'll snap your neck.

Got it?

KKINSA

(whispers)

How do you know?

RIZZO

(dread)

I just know.

YLLO

We must assume the machete was an

intricate part of the game of hockey.

DELONGPRE

I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

YLLO

Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

DELONGPRE

Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,

your Space Lab connections can deal with this

At least we'll be safe.

YLLO

They are not going anywhere. I cut power to

the  shuttle.

RIZZO

Open the doors.

KKINSA

Something's wrong.

RIZZO

Keep trying!

YLLO

Everyone ready?

YLLO

Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

YLLO

Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

THORGAN

Yuck.

DELONGPRE

We're screwed.

YLLO

The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.

We'll disembark and you'll see.

Everything will be fine.

BOEMAN

Uh...that's gonna be a problem.

The ship's not on auto-pilot.

We're flying blind.

(a beat)

Thirty minutes till impact.

YLLO

I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

THORGAN

But...

QUICK-CUT TO:

RIZZO

Damnit, he's got them.

KKINSA

Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done

something. The door won't open.

YLLO

It's alright. He can't get in here!

KKINSA

The power's back up!

RIZZO

Then open the doors!

KKINSA

Thirty seconds.

JANESSA

What do we do?!!

YLLO

Crutch?

CRUTCH

Help me up.

JANESSA

Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

THORGAN

Jesus, tell this asshole I don't

play hockey!

CRUTCH

Okay!

YLLO

Will that take us to the bridge?

CRUTCH

It's a maze up there, but yes.

YLLO

We'll engage auto-pilot!

Everything'll be fine!

KAY-EM 14

Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...

impossible...this....this... does not

make sense.

YLLO

Move it people!

BOEMAN

Help me!

YLLO

Now hold on! Have you considered

how valuable you are? Credit, fame,

you can have it all. And ladies. I

mean, how long has it been?

YLLO

(chuckles)

That's all you wanted?

YLLO(V.O.)

It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

RIZZO

(knowingly)

Three...two...one...

KAY-EM 14

Now that's just gross.

DELONGPRE

GO, GO, GO!

KKINSA

Rizzo, come on!

THORGAN(V.O.)

Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

He's right behind us!

RIZZO

Damn!

(to Kkinsa)

Close the door! I'll be right back.

KKINSA

(panicked)

What?!!

RIZZO

I gotta go back.

KKINSA

But?!!

KAY-EM 14

I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

CRUTCH

Okay, we need to ...

BOEMAN

You forgot didn't you, you old

fart?

DELONGPRE

Shit! Move it! He's coming!

DELONGPRE

Go!

DELONGPRE

Faster!

DELONGPRE

FASTER!!!

DELONGPRE

He's right on my ass!

JANESSA

That was fun.

KAY-EM 14

I got a brand new pair of

roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

JANESSA

Thorgan?!

THORGAN

I didn't do it. The fall scattered her

programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

THORGAN

Hey, I think the fall killed him.

RIZZO

Trust me, it's temporary.

BOEMAN

Better let me.

THORGAN

Where'd you get the gun?

CRUTCH

The bridge is this way!

RIZZO

Wait!

KAY-EM 14

There's not enough time.

RIZZO

Forget the bridge, the shuttle's

waiting!

BOEMAN

(to Kay-Em)

What do you mean, not enough time?

KAY-EM 14

(switches voice)

You know what you get if you shove

two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered

bananas.

JANESSA

I think your metal lover's losing it.

KAY-EM 14

(normal voice)

Impact in ten minutes. It will take

fifteen to reach the bridge.

(switches voices, sings)

Mamma's little baby love shortnin,

shortnin, mamma's little baby love

shotnin bread...

DELONGPRE

Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

RIZZO

Guys!!! The shuttle?

RIZZO

Idiots.

CRUTCH

This way!

THORGAN

I feel better. Now how do you

fire this damn thing?

DELONGPRE

Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

CRUTCH

(jokingly)

Just around this bend...

BOEMAN

Nooooo!

BOEMAN

You'll hit crutch!

RIZZO

What are you doing? You can't save him!

RIZZO

Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

DELONGPRE

(to Jason)

No you don't!

RIZZO

Don't stop!

RIZZO

You never stop when he's down!

RIZZO

Shit!!!!

CRUTCH

(weak)

Forget him. Come on.

BOEMAN

Uh-oh.

JANESSA

What?!

BOEMAN

Kkinsa! Open the doors!

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

DELONGPRE

Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

RIZZO

Yeah, that's it, scare the hell

out of here, that'll work.

RIZZO(V.O.)

(calming)

Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not

out here right now, so please let us in.

RIZZO(V.O.)

Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to

the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

DELONGPRE

Med-kit?

RIZZO

I guessed.

RIZZO(V.O.)

We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.

Just relax.

KAY-EM 14

Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects

of the human psyche.

KAY-EM 14

Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...

open the fucking door you silly bitch!

KAY-EM 14

I didn't say I was good at it.

THORGAN(V.O.)

Oh shit! There he is!

BOEMAN

Kkinsa! No!!!

RIZZO

DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

THORGAN

Did we get him?

DELONGPRE

We're screwed!

RIZZO

400 years in the future and these

pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

RIZZO

Just make a break for the door.

He'll get some of us, but that's the

breaks.

BOEMAN

We're not leaving Crutch!

RIZZO

We don't have time to argue!

JANESSA

Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

COMPUTER VOICE

Collision eminent.

BOEMAN

Everyone okay?

THORGAN

I think I broke my arm.

KAY-EM 14

I seem to have misplaced mine.

JANESSA

You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

DELONGPRE

(quiet)

We lost crutch.

BOEMAN

Goodbye old friend.

RIZZO

Okay, he was a great guy, now

let's move out.

BOEMAN

(snaps)

Could you show a little compassion?!

RIZZO

Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you

forgetting about ...

DELONGPRE

Back to the labs!

COMPUTER VOICE

Dam-damage port side 59 percent.

Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors

failing.

THORGAN

Oh shit.

JANESSA

This is just great.

KAY-EM 14

Engage magnetics.

THORGAN

This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

THORGAN

Grab my hand!

JANESSA

Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?

We'll push you in.

DELONGPRE

Hey! That hurts.

DELONGPRE

(to Rizzo)

Push off toward us.

JANESSA

Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.

Let her hang there.

THORGAN

I'm gonna spew.

JANESSA

That ought'a help the situation.

DELONGPRE

Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

RIZZO

What if you miss?

DELONGPRE

What if we don't?

DELONGPRE

He's coming right at you!

BOEMAN

(to Delongpre)

Grab my feet!

JANESSA

Okay that hurt.

BOEMAN

Thorgan, pull us in.

THORGAN

What now?

JANESSA

Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

QUICK CUT TO:

COMPUTER VOICE

System repair activated. Back up power on line.

JANESSA

(to Rizzo)

Get off of me!

THORGAN

(rubbing his arm)

You think it killed . . .

(off Rizzo's stare)

Yeah, I guess not.

JANESSA

Let's just get out of here.

BOEMAN

The ship's in bad shape. Back to

the labs. Let's check out status.

BOEMAN

Shit!

THORGAN

The hull's imploding!

BOEMAN

Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

RIZZO

Yeah. Are you guys okay?

BOEMAN

There's a red lever on the wall

beside you. Pull it!

RIZZO

It's locked!

BOEMAN

Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's

going to depressurize!

BOEMAN

Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse

the pressurization.

BOEMAN

What are you doing?!!

RIZZO

If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

BOEMAN

Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

RIZZO

No.

DELONGPRE

Rizzo?!

RIZZO

It's better this way. If we were rescued

Jason would just get off the ship. You want

him on your precious Earth II?

THORGAN

Hurry! She's lost it!

JANESSA

So what else is new?

RIZZO

Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

JANESSA

Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

COMPUTER VOICE

Depressurization inconclusive.

KAY-EM 14

We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

JANESSA

(to Rizzo)

You happy? You've killed us all!

JANESSA

What's the point?

DELONGPRE

So that's it then.

RIZZO

What's that?

BOEMAN

THat's the sound of deep space attacking the

integrity of the ship.

KAY-EM 14

No...

(signing)

That's the sound of the men working

on the chain gang.

RIZZO

Are there any other shuttles?

JANESSA

No.

RIZZO

Teleportation? Some way to beam us the

hell out of dodge?

THORGAN

You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

JANESSA

A little late to be thinking about

escape, isn't it?

KAY-EM 14

I'll never experience my fantasy of

three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.

Damn.

THORGAN

Am I in there?

KAY-EM 14

Sory...

RIZZO

Hey.

DELONGPRE

That's a good fantasy, though.

Kinky, but good.

RIZZO

Hey!!

RIZZO

What's this?

DELONGPRE

It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,

it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

RIZZO

Can we get through these?

THORGAN

Sure but what good will that do?

BOEMAN

When the left hull goes, so will the

right.

RIZZO

What if we blow the walkways first?

Leave Jason over here to go up with

the ship?

JANESSA

You know, Yllo seemed to think we could

catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth

millions.

RIZZO

Any connection between your reality and mine

is purely coincidental.

JANESSA

I'm just saying.

RIZZO

(to others)

Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.

Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up

the doors and blow the walkways?

DELONGPRE

We'd need charges.

BOEMAN

We could convert fission transistors.

THORGAN

We're not supposed to do that.

BOEMAN

What are you gonna do, tell me?

DELONGPRE

The engine room will have molecular welders.

We could seal up the hull.

JANESSA

YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big

guy distracted with a blow job.

THORGAN

Would you?

KAY-EM 14

Now this is getting exciting.

DELONGPRE

Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

RIZZO

You got a better plan?

BOEMAN

I'll need system four converters.

THORGAN

They're back here.

DELONGPRE

How many?

BOEMAN

Bring 'em all. Let's move!

THORGAN

Hey! I'm not ready.

BOEMAN

Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley

one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.

Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

JANESSA

You're so bossy.

THORGAN

You're leaving me here alone?

DELONGPRE

Don't blow your foot off.

KAY-EM 14

It's just you and me, then.

THORGAN

Come here, might as well fix that arm.

DELONGPRE

See anything?

DELONGPRE

I think I speak on behalf of the group

when I say this is bad news.

BOEMAN

(into headset)

Thorgan? You coming?!

THORGAN

(into headset)

Almost done.

KAY-EM 14

Ow!

THORGAN

Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

KAY-EM 14

Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

DELONGPRE

Put your finger here.

DELONGPRE

My father wanted me to be a businessman.

DELONGPRE

That's why I'm here.

RIZZO

So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against

your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

DELONGPRE

My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology

is part of the business. We happen to get along just

smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's

for a change.

RIZZO

I thought you meant...

DELONGPRE

You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?

You must have been a very lonely girl.

THORGAN

Sorry, sorry.

KAY-EM 14(O.S.)

Who are you apologizing to?

THORGAN

Good point.

JANESSA

Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

RIZZO

When I was four, the ocean quit producing

life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,

the occasional terrorist bombing...the

atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.

We moved underground when I was twelve.

RIZZO(O.S.)

My father was an army Scientist.

Genetics. The army thought they could

develop humans able to survive the Earth

we had created

RIZZO(O.S.)

Jason seemed to have the right stuff.

Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell

damage, didn't matter. He just kept

going.

DELONGPRE

Were you close to your father?

THORGAN(V.O.)

Delongpre? What did you do with the

chain gun?

DELONGPRE

(into mike)

It's on the table where I left it!

What the hell are you doing?!

Hurry up!

THORGAN(V.O.)

I'm on my way.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Thorgan, quit screwing around and

come on!

THORGAN(V.O.)

I'm coming, I'm coming.

DELONGPRE

Sorry, you were saying?

RIZZO(O.S.)

I got along great with my father,

my mother too. Dad and the others thought

they could learn a great deal from this

thing the army had been keeping on ice for

over a hundred years.

RIZZO(O.S.)

They were all wrong. They couldn't control

him.

DELONGPRE

And what happend to ...?

RIZZO

I couldn't save them.

DELONGPRE

Well, we'd be dead without you.

You know that, don't you?

DELONGPRE

It's true.

(chuckles)

You caused enough stink that we

were at least a little cautious.

Of course this is the first field

trip I went on that had a body count.

DELONGPRE

I'm not much, but I promise, I won't

let this guy get you.

BRODSKI

Where is everybody? What happened?

JANESSA

Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

BRODSKI

Give me a break! What happened?

JANESSA

Jason. He's what happened. Then

Grendel hit Space Lab.

BRODSKI

Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands

on Yllo.

JANESSA

Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

BRODSKI

Takes more than a steelbalde to take

this old dog down.

BRODSKI

Yup, that ought'a do it.

JANESSA

Well go on! Pass out!

JANESSA

Shit.

BRODSKI

(weak)

He-help me...

BOEMAN(V.O.)

I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

DELONGPRE

We're blowing three. Hang on.

BOEMAN

Janessa, we're on our way to you!

BOEMAN

Where is...?

DELONGPRE

You tell me! She's only set one

charge. And it's not finished!

BOEMAN

Where have you been?!!

JANESSA

He....He...

DELONGPRE

He's coming!!!

BOEMAN

Run!!

RIZZO

We can't lead him into the other hull!

BOEMAN

We don't have a choice!

KAY-EM 14

Do I have to?

THORGAN

Yes, I've reprogrammed you.

You are very brave. Bad ass.

KAY-EM 14

Oh, alright.

KAY-EM 14

Come on, boy. Let's see if we can

open up  can'a whoop ass!

DELONGPRE

Holy shit!

BOEMAN

What are we waiting for?!!

Come on!!

BOEMAN

(to Janessa)

Where the hell were you?!!

JANESSA

He came for me, I had to run!

THORGAN

(into mike)

Kay-Em, you okay?

KAY-EM 14

Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

BOEMAN

Toss me a chip.

BOEMAN

Thorgan, you're brilliant.

Have I told you that lately?

THORGAN

(quietly)

See you around.

KAY-EM 14

She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,

the girl that I adore. Her cunt

it smells like cock juice; she's

a good two-dollar whore. You may

talk to me of Seoul girls or whores

from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of

Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

BOEMAN

I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

DELONGPRE

Then stop talking and work faster!

KAY-EM 14

(still singing)

She was a young and charming girl;

her age was scarce sixteen.

KAY-EM 14

She took me in and she kicked out

a sailor and marine.

KAY-EM 14

She had no titties on her chest;

that didn't bother me,

KAY-EM 14

For what she had between her legs

was big enough for three.

BOEMAN

Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

JANESSA

I...I don't know what I did...

DELONGPRE

You lost the charge?

JANESSA

He was chasing me!

RIZZO

Can we blow it with just two?

BOEMAN

If we don't sever the hull completely

she'll drag us down with her.

DELONGPRE

Then what do we do?!

BOEMAN

I don't know!

KAY-EM 14

Why you low life, scum sucking,

rat dick blowing, sum bitch.

Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

DELONGPRE

Well, it was a good plan.

BRODSKI(O.S.)

You stupid bitch!

BRODSKI

Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

BOEMAN

Sergeant? We thought you were...

BRODSKI

Yeah, yeah.

(to Janessa)

Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

JANESSA

I don't know...sorry?

RIZZO

Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

BRODSKI

Bomb?

BOEMAN

Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

BRODSKI

How much you need?

KAY-EM 14

(condescending)

That was very good. You should

feel very good about yourself

right now. Good effort.

(tough voice)

How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

KAY-EM 14

Okay, dip shit. Time to finish

you off so I can go home and boink

your momma with a corndog. The kinky

bitch.

KAY-EM 14

(singing)

Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer

came down upon his head. Doo-pee-

do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver

hammer made sure that he was dead...

KAY-EM 14

Oh...my...god. What have I done?

(crying)

Thorgan!

KAY-EM 14

Thorgan I'm a murderer!

BRODSKI

Blowing the walkway? You come up

with that yourself?

BOEMAN

Rizzo did.

THORGAN

Kay-Em!

BOEMAN

What are you doing back?!!

KAY-EM 14

(sad)

Sumbitch won't be giving us

anymore trouble.

RIZZO

You killed him?

KAY-EM 14

(regret)

Blew half his skull away, one leg,

one arm and left his entrails

stretched across the lab. And look

at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

THORGAN

You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

KAY-EM 14

A real mamma's boy that one.

Dissed his mamma and he nearly

threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

RIZZO

His mother?

BOEMAN

What?

RIZZO

I don't know. Nothing.

BOEMAN

Hurry up people! We're running out

of time.

THORGAN

As long as they're connected we can

blow them all simultaneously from

a safe distance.

BOEMAN

Two more charges to go.

THORGAN

Done!

BOEMAN

Let's move out!

BRODSKI

Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

DELONGPRE

I need another minute. Come on!

BRODSKI

Well fuck me.

KAY-EM 14

No, fuck me.

THORGAN

Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

KAY-EM 14

Yeeee-haw!!!!

BOEMAN

Shit!

THORGAN

Kay-Em!!!

BOEMAN

Done!!

BOEMAN

RUN!!

THORGAN

Kay-Em! Get away!

KAY-EM 14

That's the best you can do?

KAY-EM 14

Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

DELONGPRE

Done!

DELONGPRE

Shit, hurry!

BOEMAN

What...?

BOEMAN

What are you doing?!!

KAY-EM 14

I think I'm going to throw up...

RIZZO(O.S.)

Hey, dickhead!

RIZZO

(to Thorgan)

Go!

RIZZO

Oh, yeah, you remember me.

BOEMAN

Hurry!

DELONGPRE

Faster! Don't we have another gun?

JANESSA

They're not gonna make it. Close the door

before he gets us all.

DELONGPRE

They'll make it.

JANESSA

Close the fucking door!

DELONGPRE

NO!

DELONGPRE

Damnit!

DELONGPRE

(glares at Janessa)

Forget it. I had to rewire it.

Once it's started it won't stop.

DELONGPRE

Get ready to blow it.

DELONGPRE

Now!

BRODSKI

Damage?

BOEMAN

Minimal.

RIZZO

We made it?

DELONGPRE

I think...I think maybe we did.

THORGAN

Kay-Em we made it!

KAY-EM 14

Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.

I'd clap if I could.

BOEMAN

I've changed the course for Earth II.

And I sent a distress signal.

VOICE(V.O.)

Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

BOEMAN

(into mike)

Our ship has been damaged, most of

the crew dead. We need evac.

VOICE

Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.

You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen

minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

BOEMAN

We're going home people.

DELONGPRE

(big smile)

See? We're not so bad.

RIZZO

Not so bad.

BOEMAN

This way!

BOEMAN

The pressures cause the engines to overheat!

Hurry!

JANESSA

Pull me in!

BRODSKI

I'm pulling, damnit!

BRODSKI

Well, that's a shame.

BRODSKI

We need weapons.

RIZZO

Weapons? All this technology and

what good has it done?!

DELONGPRE

It bought us some time.

BOEMAN

And now we're all out of it.

BOEMAN

The ship's depressurizing, the engines

overheating. When it  reaches the core,

we're done.

RIZZO

Done?

THORGAN

Kaboom.

DELONGPRE

Again?! Jesus!

RIZZO

Why am I not surprised?

KAY-EM 14

You must shut down the engines.

DELONGPRE

Then do it. The rescue ship can

find us here right?

BRODSKI

Can't shut em' down from here.

BOEMAN

Somebody's gonna have to go back

to the engine room.

DELONGPRE

You ain't catching my ass in there again.

BRODSKI

I'll go.

BOEMAN

You're too weak. I'll go.

RIZZO

You know, this future shit sucks.

I'll fucking do it.

DELONGPRE

You?

RIZZO

(mumbling)

Wait around on your asses all day.

(turns to Thorgan)

I'll need a distraction.

THORGAN

What kind of a distraction?

RIZZO

HEY!

RIZZO

You want some of me?

RIZZO

Come on, keep up.

RIZZO

You want some of me or not?

RIZZO

Take your best shot --

RIZZO

(laughs)

I'm melting! I'm melting!

RIZZO

See now that was stupid.

Persistent, yes, but stupid.

RIZZO

Not this time, asshole. This time

I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

RIZZO

Make it fast. He's coming.

DELONGPRE

Almost got it.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue

ship on radar.

RIZZO

Delongpre! Out of time!

DELONPRE

Got it!

DELONGPRE

Damn that was close!

RIZZO

(into radio)

Guys, he's right behind us!

THORGAN(V.O.)

It's okay.

DELONGPRE

Okay?!!

THORGAN(V.O.)

Just come on, I've got an idea.

BOEMAN

(into radio)

The docking bay was damaged after the

explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

DELONGPRE

Got it.

(to Rizzo)

You ever space walked?

RIZZO

Oh sure, all the time.

RIZZO

(into headset)

Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...

you'd better hurry!

(growls)

I hate the future!

QUICK CUT TO:

THORGAN

Don't worry. He can't see us.

RIZZO

Is that...?

DELONGPRE

Earth II.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Suit up.

DELONGPRE

I'll help you in.

THORGAN

(into headset)

Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,

you know that don't you?

KAY-EM 14

It was my pleasure, my love.

Perhaps if all works for the best

you can rebuild me and we can try that

doggie style thing again.

DELONGPRE

I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

KAY-EM 14

(singing happily)

I get no kick from champaign, mere

alcohol doesn't faze me at all,

but I get a kick out of you.

THORGAN

(under his breath)

Goodbye, my love.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Thorgan, suit up.

THORGAN

(to Rizzo)

This is gonna work. If he sticks to the

program. Will he? Stick to the program?

RIZZO

His mother was killed before his eyes.

That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

DELONGPRE

That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of

that future shit.

RIZZO

Eat me.

QUICK-CUT TO:

WOMAN

Help me!

(gurgles)

Jason help me!

MRS. VOORHEES

Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

MRS. VOORHEES

Don't let me die again!

QUICK-CUT TO:

KAY-EM 14

Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.

Thorgan, we've got a problem!

THORGAN(V.O.)

Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

DELONGPRE

Well, do something!

THORGAN

Shit!

BOEMAN

Just a little more time.

WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY

(sings; deep african american voice)

I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

RIZZO

Thorgan!!!!

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Sergeant!

BRODSKI(V.O.)

Get out of here!

BRODSKI(V.O.)

That all you got?!!

RIZZO

He saved our lives.

DELONGPRE

Boeman, the ships not here.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Use the thrusters and you'll

be fine. We'll huddle together

out there.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Hey, easy now.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

You wanna release your air tanks?

RIZZO(V.O.)

(nervous)

Okay, good tip.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

You'll be fine.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.

We'll be fine.

RIZZO(V.O.)

Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.

So far so good.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

BOEMAN(V.O.)

Thrusters.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Rizzo, you okay?

RIZZO(V.O.)

No I'm not okay! I don't

know what the hell I'm doing!

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

You're doing fine. I won't let

anything happen to you, remember?

QUICK CUT TO:

KAY-EM 14

Ahhhhh!

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

RIZZO(V.O.)

I think I had some when I was eight.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Did you like it?

RIZZO(V.O.)

I think so, why?

THORGAN(V.O.)

He's trying to ask you out on a date.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Shut up, Thorgan!

RIZZO(V.O.)

Delongpre, you don't even know me.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

I know you.

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Nooooooo!!

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Rizzo, pull away!

RIZZO(V.O.)

I'm stuck!

THORGAN(V.O.)

We're too far away!

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

You okay?!

RIZZO(V.O.)

(breathing steadily)

Oh great...yeah, having a great

time, and you?

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

No thank you, you crazy old woman.

RIZZO(V.O.)

Old woman?

DELONGPRE(V.O.)

Well I mean, technically you are old

enough to be my great, great, great...

RIZZO(V.O.)

I get it.

KAY-EM 14

Hello? A little assistance here?

THORGAN(V.O.)

Kay-em you okay?

KAY-EM 14

I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

THORGAN(V.O.)

I missed you too.

KAY-EM 14
