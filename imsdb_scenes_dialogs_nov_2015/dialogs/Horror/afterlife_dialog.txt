BLINDING WHITENESS

PAUL

What's wrong?

ANNA

Nothing.

PAUL

(SIGHS WEARILY)

You used to enjoy it. Now it's...

PAUL

...it's like fucking a corpse.

PAUL

Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was--

PAUL

Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid

thing to say.   But you know sometimes...

sometimes it's like you're not here

anymore. Like you're somewhere else.

2.

PAUL

Is this about us?

ON ANNA

ANNA

It's not about us.

PAUL (O.C.)

Then what is it?

ANNA

I don't know.

PAUL (O.C.)

I just want us to be happy.

PAUL (O.C.)

Are you happy?

ANNA

I'm happy.

ON ANNA

FADE TO WHITE.

3.

ELIOT

The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry.

(strokes the wood lovingly)

Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted

sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest

adjustable mattress with matching pillow.

ELIOT

Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze

exterior. Hand brushed finish with

Grecian bronze highlights.

MRS. AYRES

The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the

Antique Carlisle.

ELIOT

(writes in his notebook)

Excellent choice.

MRS. AYRES

An antique coffin for an antique lady.

We suit each other.

ELIOT

(SMILES)

You'll look beautiful.

(BEAT)

Now about the service.   Would you like a

private visitation?

ELIOT

Mrs. Ayres?

MRS. AYRES

I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation.

(HESITATES)

Mr. Deane? What happens when we die?

4.

ELIOT

It's different every time.   Each person

dies in their own way.

TALL KID

Hey.   Jack-off!

TALL KID (O.C.)

Didn't you hear me Jack-off?

ACNE KID

He must be deaf.

5.

TALL KID

You deaf Jack-off?

TALL KID

Can't fucking speak either.

ANNA

What's going on?

ANNA

Jack?

JACK

Nothing Miss Bryant.

ANNA

Nothing? The incubator didn't just

fall by itself.

JACK

I tripped.   It was an accident.

ANNA

(to the Older Boys)

Show's over. Get to your classes.

(TO JACK)

Jack. Help me clear up.

JACK

I think it's dead.

ANNA

No.   The poor thing's just scared.

6.

PAUL

OK.   Who took the last pepperoni?

PAUL

Great.  Broccoli.

(lifts out a slice)

Who the fuck ordered broccoli?

NEAL

Oh that's just disgusting.

PREPPY GUY

What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's

healthy.

NEAL

Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy.

NEAL

You ordering in another pizza?

PAUL

Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.

PREPPY GUY

(MUTTERS)

Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.

7.

PAUL

Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this

morning.    I fucked up. I know.

PAUL (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

We still on for tonight?

(BEAT)

Anna?

ANNA

I don't know Paul.

PAUL

Please Anna.    It took me weeks to get the

table.

ANNA (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

Maybe we can change it to Thursday--

PAUL

No.     It has to be tonight.

ANNA (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

Paul? What's the matter?

PAUL

Nothing. Don't worry. I just need... I

just want us to have dinner tonight.

ANNA

(HESITATES)

OK.

8.

PAUL (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

Great.

PAUL

And Anna.    Everything's going to be fine.

ANNA (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

Promise?

PAUL

I promise.

ANNA

(NERVOUSLY)

Hello?

ANNA

Is someone there?

9.

ANNA

Jack!

JACK

Did I scare you Miss Bryant?

ANNA

It's locked.

ANNA

Shouldn't you be home?

JACK

My mom's picking me up.

(BEAT)

It's my birthday. We're going to

MacDonald's. Then on Saturday my mom's

taking me to Busch Gardens. We're

going to ride the Alpengeist.

(EARNESTLY)

Continually voted one of the top ten roller

coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is

a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.

ANNA

(tries to keep a straight-face)

I didn't know the park was open yet.

JACK

My mom's friends with the manager.

They're opening it specially for me.

ANNA

Sounds like fun.

JACK

Yes.    It will be fun.

10.

ANNA

Jack. Those boys.    Do they bother you

a lot?

ANNA

You know you can always talk to me about

it if you want to.

ANNA

You sure you don't need a ride?

ANNA

Well.   I better run.

JACK

Where are you going?

ANNA

(HESITATES)

I have to go to a funeral.   My old piano

teacher.

JACK

(with sudden interest)

Can I come?

ANNA

No Jack.   Funerals are very private

affairs.

JACK

I've never been to a funeral.

ANNA

It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway

wouldn't your mom worry about you?

JACK

(SHRUGS)

Not really.

ANNA

I'm sure she would. I'll see you

tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful

birthday.

11.

ON SINK

OLD WOMAN (O.S.)

Anna?   Is that you?

ANNA

Yes Mother.

12.

BEATRICE

Terrible color.

ANNA

Can I get you something to eat?

BEATRICE

I'm not hungry.

ANNA

You have to eat.

BEATRICE

I don't have to do anything.

ANNA

The doctor said--

BEATRICE

The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know

what he's talking about.

BEATRICE

Why did you do it? Today of all days.

ANNA

What have I done wrong this time?

BEATRICE

You've forgotten haven't you?

ANNA

No I haven't forgotten.   The service

isn't till six.

BEATRICE

Then you've got plenty of time to wash it

out.

13.

ANNA

It's permanent. You can't wash it out.

BEATRICE

Then dye it back. You can't show up at

the funeral looking like that. Like some

prostitute.

ANNA

I don't look--

BEATRICE

Don't argue with me. Why are you

constantly arguing with me?

BEATRICE

Where are you going?

ANNA

To do the washing up.

BEATRICE

The sheets need changing.    They haven't

been changed in months.

ANNA

I changed them Monday.

BEATRICE

You weren't here Monday. You never sleep

at home anymore. What if something

happened to me in the middle of the night?

ANNA

Nothing is going to happen to you.

ANYWAY DIANE--

BEATRICE

(SNORTS)

Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn't have

to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter

wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of

hers. Doing God knows what. They always

leave you in the end. You'll see. Just

like your father--

ANNA

That's enough Mother!

BEATRICE

That's it.     Go and cry to Paul.

14.

BEATRICE

Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old

mother.

FATHER GRAHAM

We have entrusted our brother James

Hutton to God's mercy in sure and...

FATHER GRAHAM (O.S.)

...certain hope of the resurrection to

eternal life through our Lord Jesus

Christ, who died and rose again for us.

MRS. HUTTON

White roses. They were his favorite.

How did you know?

ELIOT

They just seemed appropriate somehow.

MRS. HUTTON

He looks so peaceful. As if he's only

sleeping.

ANNA

Mrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry.

MRS. HUTTON

Thank you Anna. You were always his

favorite student.

15.

MRS. HUTTON

How's your mother?

ANNA

Fine.   She sends her condolences.

MRS. HUTTON

You look tired dear.

ANNA

No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine.

ANNA'S POV

VIEWING ROOM

ELIOT'S POV

16.

ANNA (O.C.)

Sorry about that.

PAUL

You scared the life out of me.

PAUL

Your hair.

ANNA

You don't like it.

PAUL

I didn't say that. It's just very...

red. I mean it's not really you is it?

WAITER

Are you ready to order?

PAUL

Yes.    We'll have the duck.

ANNA

Paul.

17.

PAUL

What?    You always have the duck here.

ANNA

(picks up the menu)

I don't always have the duck.

ANNA

I'll have the duck.

PAUL

The duck is very good.

PAUL

Let's not argue tonight.    OK?

ANNA

OK.

ANNA

This is good.

ANNA

And looks very expensive...

(SMILES QUESTIONINGLY)

What's the special occasion?

PAUL

(suddenly very serious)

Actually there is something I need to

talk to you about.

PAUL

I've been offered a transfer to head

office in Chicago.

18.

PAUL

It'll mean more work of course. More

responsibility. A lot of changes. But

it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be

crazy to turn it down. And...

(NERVOUS)

...well I've been thinking. Maybe it's

time for us to...

ANNA

(without looking up)

You're going to leave me.

ANNA

You could've just told me this morning.

You didn't need to buy me off with an

expensive meal.

PAUL

Anna wait.

ANNA

Why did you lie to me? You promised

everything was going to be OK.

PAUL

(INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED)

Don't be ridiculous. Anna. You've got

it all wrong.

ANNA

I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you

always talk to me like I'm a small child?

PAUL

(as if talking to a small child)

Anna.

ANNA

See? There you go again.      Do you know

how irritating that is?

PAUL

(LOSES IT)

Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking

meal without arguing--

ANNA

Fuck you!

19.

PAUL

Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.

ANNA

FUCK YOU!

PAUL

You're crazy. You know that?      Just like

your mother.

ANNA

I'm nothing like my mother!

PAUL

(STANDS)

I'm not running after you this time Anna.

ANNA

Good.

PAUL

Anna. Open the door. Please. I want

you to come with me. I want to...

20.

ANNA'S CAR

ANNA

Shit!

ANNA

(into rear-view mirror)

OK. OK. I saw you.

(MUTTERING)

Jerk.

ANNA

Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?      I

just don't want it to end like this.

21.

CUT TO BLACK.

22.

ANNA

Where am I?

ELIOT

You're in a funeral home.

(BEAT)

You're dead.

ELIOT

You had a car accident. It was raining.

You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.

ANNA

I'm not dead.

ELIOT

You were pronounced dead eight hours ago.

Your blood no longer circulates through

your body. Your brain cells are slowly

dying. Your body's already decomposing.

ANNA

I'm not dead.

ON DOCUMENT

ELIOT (O.C.)

This is your death certificate. Cause of

death. Massive internal trauma. Time of

death. 8.23PM.

PREP ROOM

ELIOT

You were dead on arrival. The attending

physician signed here...

(points to document)

...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your

body from the hospital morgue at 12.10

this morning.

23.

ELIOT

I'm sorry.

ANNA

Who are you?

ANNA

Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?

ELIOT

I'm preparing your body. You have to

look beautiful for your funeral.

ANNA

I'm not dead.

ELIOT

You all say the same thing.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry. Maybe you should rest now.

ON ANNA

ANNA

(SOFTLY)

I can't be dead. It's just a nightmare.

I'll wake up soon. Wake up.

24.

ANNA

Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?       I

just don't want it to end like this.

ASSISTANT

It's the schoolteacher's. From the car

crash. Should I answer it?

ASSISTANT

Someone's in for a surprise.

OLD GUY

How many times do I have to tell you? You

can't leave their stuff laying around. It

should've been returned to the family.

ASSISTANT

I've been busy, OK.

(MUTTERING)

Like she's really going to need her

rollover minutes now.

ASSISTANT

What shall I do with this?

OLD GUY

Where's the other one?

25.

OLD GUY

Just burn it. You can't send them back

one shoe. It's not respectful.

PAUL

(ON PHONE)

You got it all wrong baby. I want you to

come to Chicago with me. Look. I'll

swing by your place on my way to the

office. You know I love you.

PAUL

Anna!

PAUL

(INTO PHONE)

It's me again. I must have just missed you

at home. Call me when you get this. OK?

TEACHER

... the shell grows slowly...

26.

PAUL

Oh hi.   I'm looking for Anna Bryant.

TEACHER

(INDIGNANT)

I'm sorry but you just can't--

PAUL

I'm Anna's... fiancee. Paul Conran.     I

thought this was her class.

PAUL

We had a little misunderstanding last

night.

TEACHER

(HESITATES)

She didn't come in today.

PAUL

Did she call in sick?

TEACHER

She hasn't called in at all. It's not

like her. She always calls in.

ANNA

Please don't hurt me.

ELIOT

(SMILES)

How can I hurt you?     You're already dead.

ANNA

But I'm not dead.

27.

ELIOT

Then why are you here?

ANNA

Please. Just let me go. I won't go to

the police. I won't tell anyone.

ELIOT

You're still in denial. You have to

trust me. I'm only here to help you.

ELIOT

Don't be scared.

ANNA

What are you doing?

ELIOT

This will relax your muscles. Stop the

rigor mortis setting in so I can work on

your body.

ELIOT

(TO HIMSELF)

Your mother's early.

28.

ELIOT

I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's

always so tragic when you lose a child.

BEATRICE

I lost her years ago.

ELIOT

If you'd care to come to my office we can

discuss the arrangements.

BEATRICE

I want to see her.

ELIOT

But she hasn't been--

BEATRICE

I don't care. I want to see her.

ELIOT

Of course.

ELIOT

Ah.   Forgive me.

ELIOT

As I said. I've only just started

preparing her.

BEATRICE

What's the point of preserving the body

if the soul's already left?

ELIOT

(quietly to himself)

No.   The soul never leaves.

29.

BEATRICE

It's us who are left behind. It's us who

suffer.

(TO ANNA)

Who's going to look after me now? Did

you think about that?

ELIOT

I'll confirm the date with Father Graham

this afternoon. Friday as you requested.

BEATRICE

Just do what you think's best.   It's just

details.

BEATRICE

Oh there is one thing.

ELIOT

Yes?

BEATRICE

Her hair. She was a brunette.    I'd like

it back to that color.

PAUL'S POV

PAUL'S CAR

30.

PAUL

Mrs. Bryant.

PAUL

Hi Diane.   I need to talk to Anna.

PAUL

What's wrong?

DIANE

I think you better come in.

PAUL

What happened? Where's Anna?

BEATRICE

(WITHOUT TURNING)

Anna was in a car accident last night.

My daughter's dead. That's what

happened.

PAUL

A car crash?     When?

BEATRICE

(IRRITABLY)

I don't know.

DIANE

They said it happened just before 8.30.

PAUL

But... we were at the restaurant...

BEATRICE

You shouldn't have let her drive in that

weather.

31.

PAUL

No. She can't be dead.    There must be

some mistake.

BEATRICE

There's no mistake. We just got back

from the funeral home.

BEATRICE

(DRYLY)

Flowers? How appropriate.

PAUL

Why didn't you call me?

BEATRICE

You took her away from me.   I don't want

you anywhere near her.

32.

ANNA

I must be in shock.     That's all.   It's

just shock.

ANNA

(HOARSE)

Let me out!

ELIOT'S POV

ELIOT

Can I help you?

PAUL

Mr. Deane?

ELIOT

Yes.

PAUL

My name's Conran.      Paul Conran.

ELIOT

Of course. The lawyer.

(off Paul's surprised look)

It's a small town. In my line of work

you get to know everyone eventually.

33.

PAUL

I'm Anna Bryant's fiancee.

ELIOT

That's strange. She wasn't wearing an

engagement ring.

PAUL

Well not quite fiancee...

ELIOT

I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.

PAUL

I'd like to see her.

ELIOT

I'm afraid the viewing isn't until--

PAUL

I'd need to see her now.    If that's

possible.

ELIOT

I'm sorry. It's not possible.     You're

not family and--

PAUL

Please.   It'd only take a minute.

ELIOT

I understand. But--

PAUL

NO.   YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

ANNA

(WEAKLY)

Paul! I'm here! Paul!

PAUL

I tried to stop her.     She didn't hear me.

34.

ELIOT

Mr. Conran.  There really is nothing I

can do. I'm so sorry.

ANNA

Who was that?

ELIOT

No one.

ANNA

No one?

ELIOT

It was Paul.

ANNA

(CALMLY)

I know. I heard you talking to him.

Why didn't you let him see me?

ELIOT

Did you love him?

ANNA

That's none of your business.

ANNA

You weren't going to tell me Paul was

here, were you?

ELIOT

No.

ANNA

Why not?

35.

ELIOT

Because it would only hurt you. You have

to let go of the living. Just like they

have to let go of you.

ANNA

I don't believe you.   Why are you doing

this to me?

ELIOT

You're all the same. You all blame me

for your death. As if it were my fault.

ANNA

No. You drugged me.    So my mother

WOULDN'T--

ELIOT

The others. They just see you as a dead

body on a slab. Only I can see you as

you really are.

ANNA

You're crazy!

ELIOT

I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this.

ELIOT

Oh I nearly forgot.    How tall are you?

ANNA

What!?

ELIOT

Five seven.

ANNA

Why..?

ELIOT

I need to know how tall you are.   For

your coffin.

36.

ANNA

Wait!

ANNA

Oh God.   Please. I don't want to die.

ON NEWSPAPER

JACK

You were supposed to pick me up from

school yesterday.

37.

JACK

I waited.

POLICE OFFICER

(INTO PHONE)

Hang on a sec.

(TO PAUL)

Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend.

I'm sorry.

PAUL

Is Tom in?

POLICE OFFICER

The captain just stepped out. He won't

be long. You can wait in his office if

you want.

PAUL

Thanks.   I'll just go and grab a coffee.

POLICE OFFICER

(INTO PHONE)

A buddy of the captain's. Poor guy...

38.

PAUL

Come on.

PAUL

You piece of shit.

ANNA'S CAR

MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)

Paul?

39.

GARAGE

TOM

You OK?

PAUL

(UNCONVINCING)

I'm fine.

TOM

I just found out. I'm so sorry Paul.       If

you need anything--

PAUL

I need to see Anna.

TOM

(PUZZLED)

What do you mean?

PAUL

The funeral director won't let me see her

Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you

talk to him? Put some pressure on him.

TOM

I can't do that.

PAUL

Tom.    You're my friend.

TOM

Paul.     I can't do it.

TOM

You sure you're OK?

PAUL

I fucked up.

TOM

Paul. It was an accident. You should

get some rest. Let me drive you home.

PAUL

I always fuck everything up.

40.

PREP ROOM

ANNA

Who is she?

ELIOT

Mrs. Whitehall.

ELIOT

You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead

can't harm the dead.

ANNA

(FORCEFULLY)

But I'm not dead!

ANNA

Stay where you are.

41.

ELIOT

(holds out his hand)

Give me the scissors. I only want to

help you.

ANNA

Don't come any closer.     I swear to God

I'll kill you.

ELIOT

(CALMLY)

Go ahead.

ELIOT

Go on.

PREP ROOM

ELIOT

What are you waiting for?

ANNA

I'm breathing!

(raises her head)

Look. I'm still alive!

ELIOT

You think you're still alive because

you're still attached to life. It's

normal. You're just imagining you still

have symptoms of life.

ANNA

Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The

doctors made a mistake. They're always

making mistakes.

ELIOT

You died.   Everyone dies.

42.

ANNA

How can I be dead if we're talking?

ELIOT

We're talking not because you're alive.

But because I have a gift.

(BEAT)

I can talk to those between life and death.

ANNA

Why?

ELIOT

To help them make the transition.

ANNA

Is this what happens when you die?

ELIOT

It depends on how you lived your life.

ANNA

What do you mean?

ELIOT

Not everyone needs my help. Some let

go as soon as their body dies. Others

don't let go until long after they're

in the grave.

ANNA

Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here?

ELIOT

You're here so I can bury you.

ELIOT

Come.    We've wasted enough time already.

ANNA

(WHISPERS)

No.    Please. I don't want--

ELIOT

You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't

count anymore.

43.

ANNA

But I can breathe.     I must be alive.

ELIOT

You people. You all think that if you

breathe, shit, piss you're alive.

ELIOT

You clutch onto life as if your life was

worth clutching onto. Was your life

worth clutching onto Anna?

ELIOT

Was it?   Maybe you died a long time ago.

ELIOT

I have to tell you I'm surprised you're

still arguing with me. You don't have

much time left.

(gestures to the Old Women)

Look. She's accepted her death. Her

life has been examined. She has no more

regrets. And now she's at peace. She

used her time well. You still have so

much to learn.

ANNA

I have nothing to learn!

ELIOT

Are you sure?

ELIOT

Your funeral's in three days. Soon

you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then

buried in the ground. No-one will hear

you then. No-one will talk to you there.

ANNA

Are you cold?

44.

ANNA

I'm so cold.

PREP ROOM

ANNA

You had a long life.

ANNA

You look so peaceful.

(BEAT)

Aren't you scared?

ANNA

I'm scared.    I'm so scared.

ON PAUL

45.

PREP ROOM

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

I'm disappointed with you.

ANNA

Who are you?

46.

GIRL

You promised me so many things.

(AMUSED)

You don't recognize me?

GIRL

I am you. I've been waiting for you.

You shouldn't have disappointed me.

OLD WOMAN

You're not ready.

CUT TO A SEARING WHITENESS.

ON CASKET

47.

ELIOT

(to Jack without looking up)

Can I help you?

ELIOT

Then perhaps you can help me.

(holds up the withered flowers)

Could you throw these away for me?

ELIOT

Thank-you.

ON JACK

ELIOT (O.C.)

There's no life left in them.

VIEWING ROOM

ELIOT

They belong in the garbage.

ELIOT

I've seen you round here before.

ELIOT

Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?

JACK

I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.

ELIOT

Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not

until Friday.

JACK

Where is she now?

48.

ELIOT

She's downstairs.

JACK

Why?

ELIOT

Why?  Because she's not ready.

(BEAT)

Is the flower for her?

JACK

(NODS)

She was my teacher.

ELIOT

And you are?

JACK

Jack.

ELIOT

Well Jack.      What did you think?

JACK

About what?

ELIOT

Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.     Did you find

it interesting?

JACK

(SHRUGS)

It was OK I guess.

ELIOT

Oh.    I see.

JACK

Are all funerals the same?

ELIOT

No Jack. They're never the same. Each

one is special. The dead always speak to

us in different ways.

JACK

(CURIOUS NOW)

What do you mean?

ELIOT

It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.

49.

ELIOT

(ANGRY)

Why did you do this?

ELIOT

WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

ANNA

Is this the afterlife?    Am I in heaven?

Or am I in hell?

ANNA

The door...

(POINTS DISTRACTEDLY)

There was a door. Just there.

ELIOT

(GENTLY)

It won't be long now.

ANNA

I used to believe in God. I thought I'd

see him when I died. Instead I saw you.

50.

ANNA

(WHISPERS)

Maybe you are God.

ELIOT

You'll be at peace soon.     I promise.

ANNA

Paul.

ANNA (O.S.)

(WHISPERS)

Paul.

51.

PAUL'S POV

BATHROOM

PAUL

(WHISPERS)

Anna.

JACK

(SHOUTS)

Mom!    We're out of milk.

52.

ANNA

What's that?

ELIOT

It's your dress. For your funeral. Your

mother brought it round this morning.

I'm the only one who can hear you now.

I'd be very careful if I were you. The

dead have such a hold over the living.

ANNA

What do you mean?

ELIOT

(nods to the phone)

He still feels your presence. You're

only causing him more pain. If you

really loved him, you'd accept your death

and let him go.

Then prove to me I'm really dead.

I thought when you died you wouldn't

Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later.

Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll

see you at the service. Thanks again.

ELIOT

I just told you. That was your brother.

You had an accident. You're dead. Why

do you people never listen to me?

ELIOT

No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse.

ELIOT

I take care of each of you as if you were

my children. I wash the shit from your

bodies. I dress you. I do everything to

make you look more beautiful than when

you were alive. And what do you do?

ELIOT

You argue with me. As if it were my fault

you're dead. As if I was to blame.

(slams down the lipstick.)

What? You're not talking to me now? You

don't want to?

You don't talk because you have nothing

You're frightened by it. I was scared

too the first time. But you shouldn't

be. Christ had the same gift. He raised

Lazarus and spoke to the dead.

You spoke to Miss Bryant?

One of Anna's students.

In the window.

ELIOT

Do you mean Jack?

PAUL

You know him?

ELIOT

Of course I know him. He's often round

here. He seems to have a strange

fascination with death. He's eleven

years old Mr. Conran. And like all young

boys has a vivid imagination. Now if

you'll excuse me--

PAUL

I don't think he imagined it.   I think he

really saw her.

Are you out of your fucking mind?

Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see

her. He's keeping her there--

TOM

Anna was in a car accident. Her car was

wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs.

PAUL

She's not dead.

TOM

Here's the Coroner's report.

PAUL

Look.

(shows file to Tom)

The paramedics phoned it in. They only

checked for eye dilation and pulse. The

doctor signed the death certificate

without even seeing her body.

TOM

(IRRITATED)

So?   That's standard procedure.

PAUL

There was no EEG. Nothing. He could

have drugged her to make it look like she

was dead.

TOM

Drugged her?     Are you serious?

JEFF

There are drugs like that chief.

Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis

within seconds. The heartbeat slows to

almost nothing.

PAUL

See? I'm telling you. She's not dead.

The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.

VINCENT (O.C.)

I saw her.

VINCENT

She was on the slab.     Dead.

81.

PAUL

No!

VINCENT

I've seen dead bodies.       Believe me, she

was definitely dead.

PAUL

Tom. Just go down there and check the

place out.

TOM

On what grounds Paul?       Do you have any

evidence?

PAUL

No.     But--

TOM

Do you have anything?

PAUL

I think she called me.

TOM

Called you?

PAUL

(WEAKLY)

On the telephone.

VINCENT

Collect or long distance?

TOM

First you hit a fucking kid. Then you

attack Deane. And now you're telling me

your dead girlfriend called you? What the

fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul.

TOM

I know you feel guilty but you've got to

pull yourself together.

82.

PAUL

Maybe you're right.    But why won't he let

me see her?

TOM

Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow.

You'll see her then. It'll help. It

will give you closure. Trust me.

JACK

You said you could teach me.

ELIOT

It's only a hole in the ground.   I'm

digging it for--

JACK

Miss Bryant.

ELIOT

Exactly.   For Anna.   She belongs here.

JACK

Because she's dead.

ELIOT

No.   Because there's no life left in her.

ELIOT

Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm

the only one who can see all these

corpses. Wandering the earth

aimlessly. All they do is piss and

shit. Suffocating us with their

stench. Doing nothing with their

lives. Taking the air away from those

who actually want to live. I have to

bury them all. I have no choice.

Tomorrow's your funeral.

I told you.   You only had three days.

ELIOT

I told you to use your time well.

ANNA

I need to... I have so many regrets.     I

have nothing but regrets.

ANNA

That's why I'm here isn't it?      To be

judged.

ELIOT

You're here to understand your life.       So

you can finally be at peace.

ANNA

I wanted a different life.

ELIOT

Then why didn't you do anything about it?

ANNA

No matter what I did everything just

stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd

shower. Sit in the same traffic

everyday on my way to work. Go home.

Go to sleep. Then wake again.

ELIOT

What did you really want from life?

ANNA

I just wanted to be happy.

ELIOT

(DERISIVELY)

Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy.

What does it mean Anna? To be happy?

ANNA

I don't know. Don't you understand?

That's the whole point. I don't know.

Yes you do! You're just too scared to

admit it to yourself.

I don't want to talk about it anymore.      I

just want this to be over.

I wanted to love but I didn't know how.

I was...

When I was a child... my mother.

ANNA

When I was a child. I learnt that love.

That when you love someone. You get

hurt. So I learned not to love. That

way no one could ever hurt me again.

ANNA

I was always pushing Paul away.      He

thought I didn't love him.

ELIOT

Did you?

ANNA

He was the only one I ever loved. But I

never told him that. And then he stopped

loving me.

What would you do if you had another

chance?

Well?   Isn't this what you wanted?
