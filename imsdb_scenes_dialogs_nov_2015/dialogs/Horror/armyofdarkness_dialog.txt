1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1

ASH

Why would you say that I am

insane?  I wouldn't say that I've

lost my mind simply because I've

heard the voices and seen the

godless things moving in the

woods. If anything, I think more

clearly now than ever before. I

know now that there is such a

thing as a living Evil. A dark

and shapeless thing that lives

not in the spaces we know, but

between them. In the Dark. In the

night. And it wants the exact same

thing as you and I: a chance at

warm life on this Earth. It

doesn't care that is already had

that chance ...once. Now listen

closely because there isn't much

time. Listen and believe, because

it's all true.

DISSOLVE TO:

2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2

ASH (V.O.)

I first saw the damn thing at that

blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.

An ancient Sumarrian text, bound

in human flesh and inked in human

blood. It contained bizarre burial

rites, prophesies...and

instruction for demon

resurrection. It was never meant

for the world of the living.

The book awoke something dark in

the woods.

So I lopped it off at the wrist.

7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7

ASH (V.O.)

In order to rid myself of the foul

thing, I read from a passage in

the book that was supposed to open

a hole.  A hole in Time that would

send the Evil back. And it worked.

of that pit!  May God have mercy

require. It contains passages that

can dispel the Evil from this

place and return you to your time.

ASH

The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's

the thing that got me here.

WISEMAN JOHN

It is in a place far from here.

It can only be retrieved by the

Promised one. Other Warriors have

tried.  Their widows grieve still.

We have waited long years for you.

Out only hope is the Necronomicon.

Thou must undertake to quest for

it.  Alone must thou travel to

a distant cemetery. There thou

shalt find it.

ASH (V.O.)

We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure

we had our problems.  But in the

end, he was all right.

DISSOLVE TO:

623	EXT. SEASHORE - DUSK								    623

DISSOLVE TO:

624	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							624

ASH (V.O.)

Peace was made between the two

peoples.  And a new nation was

formed.  They offered my a chance

to stay among them and teach them.

A chance to lead them.  To be

King.  But Sheila was gone.

Besides, I had places to go.

625	THE WISEMEN										   625

WISEMAN JOHN

The Book tells us that each drop

allows a man to sleep a century.

Swallow six drops, and thou shalt

awaken in thine own time.

ASH (V.O.)

Yeah.  Right...

...but what other choice did I

have?

DISSOLVE TO:

630	INT. CAVE - DEATHCOASTER								630

631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631

ASH (V.O.)

I closed my eyes.

ASH (V.O.)

I took a drink.

ASH (V.O.)

I didn't know if it was day or

night. I started... to get

drowsy... And I slept...

DISSOLVE TO:

634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634

ASH

...And dreamed.

636	THE SUN											  636

637	THE MOON											 637

638	A CRACK											  638

Dreams last lasted centuries.

ASH (V.O.)

And when I awoke...

644	ASH												 644

645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645

646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646

647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647

ASH

....I found that I had slept too

long.

648	ASH												 648

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END.
