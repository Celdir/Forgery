The job market for teachers is supposed

How about our last jay?

That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve

Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.

You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into

'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out

the boathouse.  I want him to start with

the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?

ALICE

You told her to sweep the courts.

STEVE

I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.

I thought we had two weeks...

ALICE

You can changed in three.

To answer your question, my parents once

owned this camp.  There were some tragic

accidents and they went bankrupt.  I

promised them I'd reopen if I could.

See if it closes right now.

NED

Looks good.

STEVE

Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?

STEVE

She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And

I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.

Okay, Camper?

JACK

For sure.

CUT TO:

37    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY

STEVE

You draw very well.

ALICE

Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more

time at it.

STEVE

This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?

STEVE

(continuing)

Any particular reason?

ALICE

Just a feeling.

(pause)

Nothing personal.

STEVE

(nodding)

You want to leave?

ALICE

I don't know.  Probably be best for

everybody.

STEVE

You may not care a lot about this place,

Alice, but I mean to make it my whole

life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme

a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it

ready.  Next Friday, if you're not

happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.

I'll be grateful.

ALICE

Next Friday.

STEVE

Thanks, Alice.

STEVE

(continuing)

I've got to go to town and pick up the

trailer and all that other stuff, but

I'll be back around ten.  If you're

still up, we can talk, okay?

ALICE

Sure.

CUT TO:

38    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY (LATER)

JACK

You want it listed separately?

STEVE

Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the

archery range.  If Annie gets here, have

her start in on the kitchen.  Do your

best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary

inspection by the state safety people.

I'd like to look good.

NED

He neglected to mention this place is

called "Camp Blood" downtown.

ALICE

How come?

NED

Some campers drowned.  Then some

counsellors got killed.

BILL

No shit.  When?

NED

Late fifties sometime.  They never

caught the guy who did it either.

MARCIE

Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is

going to tell us that there are poisonous

snakes in the outhouse and green lizards

in the lake.

You're crazy!

Did anyone ever tell you you're

beautiful when you're angry?

BRENDA

I don't believe you...

NED

Want to see my trick shot?  It's even

better.

Oh, my God...

BILL

You okay?

BILL

(continuing)

You're lucky.

BILL

(continuing)

How come you're leaving?

ALICE

It's long and personal.  It has nothing

to do with you or the other kids.

BILL

Maybe I can help?

ALICE

And it's this place.  It makes no sense,

but it spooks me.

BILL

(smiling)

You're right.  It makes no sense.

I just wasn't ready for that kind of

pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.

When I got back there, he sent a telegram

saying he was going back to his wife.

BILL

What'll you do when you leave here?

ALICE

I don't know.

MARCIE

Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe

BILL

Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm

ready.  Frozen yogurt?

Okay.  Can I help?

BRENDA

It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a

salad.  The guys are planning to cook

greaseburgers for themselves.

MARCIE

There's a lot of dishes if you just want

something to do.

ALICE

The way I feel, that's perfect.

JACK                          BILL

Wait, wait!   When I was finding these

goodies in the shed.  I also found this

letter which a camper never sent home.

Listen.

NED

(improvising)

Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine

except for the strange man who flies at

night and sucks our counsellor's body...

NED

(continuing)

And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor.

He says that whenever I'm scared, I can

sleep in his bunk with him.

NED

(continuing)

No wonder they lost America.  How could

you sneak around in the bushes wearing

that?  What's to eat?

BRENDA

Whatever you make yourself.

BRENDA                        JACK

How can you eat that stuff?   You like them rare?

Looks like dead animals.

BILL

Trouble?

ALICE

Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a

little gloomy in here.

I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd

have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that

Whew.

BILL

This puddle was enough to ground you all

JACK

Floor probably leaks.  This area is full

NED

Alice, you're just lucky there are no

snakes in the dishwater here.

MARCIE

Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.

JACK

What is it?

BILL

Is it stuck?

Chance to get even?

I'll spot you five points.

NED

Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it

again.

NED

(continuing)

I'm sorry.

ALICE

Ned?  We're gonna be working together

for a while.  You're a nice guy without

all the entertainment, okay?

NED

Tell 'em I'm sorry?

Sure.

I'm gonna go lie down and catch some

He's probably setting up another one of

his practical jokes.

MARCIE

Yeah, like draining the lake!

JACK

(to MARCIE)

Hey, how about a walk by the lake?

JACK

(continuing)

Just a walk, for Chrissakes.

What about Neddy?

JACK

I don't love Neddy.

MARCIE

He keeps on acting like such an asshole!

JACK

Ned!

MARCIE

Don't call him.

JACK

I thought you wanted to give him one of

your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do

whatever he wants to do, you know.

MARCIE

I guess...

JACK

Looks like a storm.

MARCIE

I'm a little scared of storms.  Always

have been.  Since I was a kid.

JACK

You?  The brick?

MARCIE

I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a

dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.

The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can

hear the sound.  I try to close my ears

off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets

louder.  The rain turns to blood and the

blood washes down in little rivers.  And

the sound stops.

JACK

It's just a dream.

I call it my shower dream.

Aw.

I have six new counsellor up there.

They're all babes in the woods in every

They'll be okay if they know enough to

stay in outta the rain.

How much do I owe you?

SANDY

One night on the town.

STEVE

I mean...

SANDY

...I know what you mean.  Two and a

quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to

make up for me spending the night alone.

SANDY

You got a roof for that Jeep?

STEVE

Yeah.  I got it on before this--

Good point.

Well, it hasn't been that long.

Long enough for me.

I think we should go wake them up.  Just

Bad enough we got a full moon; it's

Friday the 13th.  They keep statistics.

We get more accidents, more robberies,

more rapes, more homicides, more of

everything when there's a full moon.  It

affects people.  Makes 'em nuts.

You've made a science out of coincidence.

Camp Blood.

MRS. VOORHEES

You know a boy drowned the year before

those two others were killed?  An

accident?  It was inadequate supervision.

The counsellors were not paying enough

attention... They were making love when

that boy drowned.

We should go now.

Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.

No.  That won't be necessary.

drowned, but I know it was inadequate

supervision...

Mr. Christy will be back soon.

MRS. VOORHEES

No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
