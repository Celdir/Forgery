Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut

serpentes!

HENNESSEY

(whispering)

Thank God you're here...

JOHN

This is Constantine. John

Constantine, asshole.

JOHN

How ya doing?

JEANIE

Vamos juntos a matarla.

JOHN

Let's see who we got here...

JOHN

I need a mirror. Now.

JOHN

A large mirror. At least --

(sizes up the child)

-- three feet high.

(CONTINUED)

6.

JOHN

MOVE.

JOHN

Chaz?

JOHN

Move the car.

CHAZ

Why?

JOHN

MOVE THE DAMN CAR.

CHAZ

Park the car -- Move the car...

CHAZ

There, I moved the damn car.

7.

JOHN

Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind

from the flesh I command thee --

JOHN

That's it -- time to go home.

JEANIE

Tiempo para morir!

JOHN

Amar natash bow basar --

JOHN

Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.

(CONTINUED)

8.

JOHN

Hennessey, tie it off --

JOHN

Now close your eyes -- all of you

-- and whatever happens -- do not

look into the mirror.

JOHN

Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind

from the flesh I command thee!

JOHN

No!

HENNESSEY

John?!

JOHN

(looking into

mirror)

Not yet!

(CONTINUED)

9.

JOHN

Look!   Look at me!

JOHN

Goddamit -- look!

JOHN

Smile pretty you vain prick.

JOHN

Now, Hennessey. Now!

JOHN

For your boss.

JOHN

No you don't.

(CONTINUED)

10.

CHAZ

SHIT!

HENNESSEY

Now about the fee...

(CONTINUED)

11.

HENNESSEY

Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...

JOHN

Hennessey.

HENNESSEY

I know, I know, but I didn't think

she was really possessed, not like

that.

JOHN

I'm not back an hour and you drag

me into --

HENNESSEY

-- Don't be mad, John, don't be --

HENNESSEY

On the left side.

HENNESSEY

Vest pocket.

JOHN

Don't do that shit on me --

HENNESSEY

Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have

half.

(CONTINUED)

12.

JOHN

I should take it all, save you

from yourself.

HENNESSEY

It keeps them out, so I can sleep.

Please, John, I need to sleep.

JOHN

I told you to move it.

CHAZ

Well maybe if you had told me you

were dropping a three-hundred

pound mirror with a pissed-off

demon in it I would have moved it

further.

CHAZ

Well?

JOHN

Well what?

CHAZ

Shouldn't have cut your stay in

the land of enlightenment. You

were so close to growing a

conscience.

(CONTINUED)

13.

JOHN

Los Angeles...

JOHN

Never ceases to entertain.

MAN (V.O.)

You still with me?

ANGELA

Yeah...

MAN (O.S.)

So what's next, Detective?   We

gonna do a full marathon?

ANGELA

Put your weapon on the tracks and

step out with your hands above

your head.

(CONTINUED)

14.

MAN (O.S.)

Or how 'bout you show yourself and

I put a bullet in your skull just

like I did hers!

ANGELA

That's just not going to happen.

MAN (O.S.)

You sure about that?!

ANGELA

(almost pleading)

Now put down your weapon on the

tracks and --

MAN (O.S.)

Well ain't this a peach?!

DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.)

(over radio)

Get off the tracks! Blueline is

coming! Clear the tracks!

MAN (O.S.)

C'mon, Detective, step into the

light and be saved!!

(CONTINUED)

15.

CHAZ

There are four bags. I have two

hands. This give you any ideas?

JOHN

Make two trips?

16.

CHAZ

(yells across room)

Simple question. How much longer

do I have to be your slave?

JOHN

You're not my slave, Chaz. You're

my very appreciated assistant.

Like Tonto and Robin and that

skinny fellow with the fat friend.

CHAZ

How much longer?

JOHN

Well I don't know, what's the

going rate for saving a taxi

driver hanging from his

fingernails about to be swallowed

into the jaws of Hell?

CHAZ

So what time you want me back?

JOHN

I need to make an appearance at

Midnite's. Say ten-ish?

JOHN

Chaz...?

(CONTINUED)

17.

JOHN

A little something from Delphi.

CHAZ

Gee, thanks.

BEEMAN (O.S.)

'Provisions depleted?'

BEEMAN

I gave you three months worth.

You were gone only one.

JOHN

What can I say, Beeman, India was

a real drain.

BEEMAN

So what do you need?

JOHN

Everything you got.

BEEMAN

(pausing)

You smell something, John?

JOHN

Maybe. Incubus in this girl I

just exorcized seemed a bit more

spirited than usual.

(CONTINUED)

18.

BEEMAN

Well, I've got your stone

fragments from the Road to

Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea

Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --

BEEMAN

Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.

BEEMAN

Yeah, to you it's nothing but to

the Fallen -- like fingernails on

a chalkboard.

JOHN

What is it with you and bugs?

BEEMAN

Gold was blessed by the Bishop

Anicott during the Crusades.

BEEMAN

Watch it there.

BEEMAN

Dragon's breath.

JOHN

I thought you couldn't get it

anymore.

(CONTINUED)

19.

BEEMAN

Whoa, don't want to get a flame

near this.

(off John's look)

Piece of the shroud Moses wore to

the mountain.

JOHN

Got any callinicus?

BEEMAN

(intrigued)

How spirited was this incubus?

JOHN

(coughs)

Like it was trying to come right

out through the girl

JOHN

I know how it sounds...

BEEMAN

We're finger puppets to them,

John, elaborate costumes -- they

can work us but don't come through

us. They can't. You know that.

JOHN

Check the scrolls anyway.

Corinthians. See if there are any

precedents.

BEEMAN

Sure, John.   Anything else?

JOHN

(coughs again)

Wouldn't happen to have anything

for --

BEEMAN

On the house.

20.

WEISS (O.S.)

Gutsy move out there, Dodson.

ANGELA

Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.

WEISS

You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No

point in using the other words.

ANGELA

Thanks.

WEISS

(shuts his locker)

Even though it was reckless --

irresponsible -- stupid...

ANGELA

I knew you still cared.

WEISS

You're good, Angela, real good but

one of these days...

ANGELA

(heard it before)

I know, nobody's luck lasts

forever.

(CONTINUED)

21.

JOHN

Two frogs on a bench.

CHAZ

Two frogs on a bench.

CHAZ

What?   But I'm with him!   Right,

John?   John?

NICO

Neighborhood's going to Hell.

(CONTINUED)

22.

JOHN

Numquam leadatur a morsu.

JOHN

Bastard changed the code again.

(bangs the doors)

Midnite! Come on, do I have to

huff and puff here?!

MIDNITE (O.S.)

Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut

num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui

serpentes...

JOHN

Deciding which color to paint this

place again?

MIDNITE

You're back early.

JOHN

I got tired of spending your

money.

(CONTINUED)

23.

MIDNITE

But I'm sure you spent enough.

JOHN

Well I do have a certain standard

of living.

MIDNITE

Tell me you found it.

JOHN

I found the vault.

MIDNITE

That's not what I asked.

JOHN

Hey, can I help it if Buddhist

monks don't take bribes?

JOHN

Gotcha.

MIDNITE

Second century depiction of a

sephiroth in the 4th realm...

JOHN

Right.    So we good here?

MIDNITE

It should counter the iconic

plane --

JOHN

That damn thing's never going to

balance.

(CONTINUED)

24.

MIDNITE

Must I remind you of what selling

fake relics will do to your

health?

JOHN

It's authentic, Midnite, you just

have the wrong piece. Jesus...

JOHN

What? -- I didn't blink -- that

was a cough. You never cough?

JOHN

Better not be any Washingtons in

here this time.

MIDNITE

Why did you cut your trip short?

JOHN

I don't know... Just a feeling --

JOHN

Balthazar.

BALTHAZAR

We're not still whining about

Manhattan, are we?

BALTHAZAR

That expression alone has made my

entire night.

(CONTINUED)

25.

JOHN

I'll make your night -- I'll

deport your sorry ass right where

you stand --

MIDNITE

JOHN.

JOHN

It's bad enough that you let these

half-breeds in at all but this

piece of shit --

BALTHAZAR

Perks of becoming a primary

investor.

JOHN

What?!

BALTHAZAR

Things change, balances shift.

Get used to it, Constantine.

JOHN

Not while I'm still breathing --

BALTHAZAR

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

HENNESSEY

Hey, John.

(CONTINUED)

26.

HENNESSEY

I'm real sorry about this morning,

John, real sorry. Please don't

hate me for draggin' you into

that. Please don't...

JOHN

I don't hate you.

HENNESSEY

That's good to hear. Real good...

JOHN

But could you at least wait until

I call for you before you show up?

HENNESSEY

You didn't call?

JOHN

Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you

freak me out sometimes.

HENNESSEY

So you want me to go away and come

back?

JOHN

No. I've got an assignment for you.

HENNESSEY

Really?   What kind of assignment?

JOHN

The kind you'll have to be sober

for.

HENNESSEY

Oh God, you want me to surf the

ether.

JOHN

Come on, you know that exorcism

wasn't right.

(CONTINUED)

27.

HENNESSEY

I... I don't have the Sight

anymore.

JOHN

Don't have it or don't want to use

it?

JOHN

Just look around. A few days.

You spot anything unusual,

anything -- you let me know.

Okay?

JOHN

It'll be like old times.

JOHN

Just for a few days.

HENNESSEY

Okay, okay... for you, John.      Like

old times. Right.

ANGELA

I killed a man today.   Another

one.

FATHER GARRET

I'm sorry, Angela.

ANGELA

Most cops go twenty years without

firing their gun. Not me. I

always seem to be in the wrong

place at the wrong time.

28.

ANGELA (V.O.)

I didn't even see his face. I

just pulled the trigger and he

went away. Just like all the

others...

FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

These feelings are natural in your

line of work, Angela. I'd be

worried if you didn't have them.

FATHER GARRET (V.O.)

But you have to be strong. You

can't allow your faith to be

overshadowed by guilt.

ANGELA (V.O.)

I'm trying.

ANGELA (V.O.)

I'm trying real hard.

29.

30.

MATCH CUT TO:

WEISS (V.O.)

It's her, Angela...

WEISS

It's Isabel.

ANGELA

She... she fell from the roof?

WEISS

No.   She jumped.

WEISS

I know it's hard to accept but --

(CONTINUED)

31.

ANGELA

Isabel would never in a million

years take her own life. Never.

WEISS

Angela... there was a surveillance

camera on the roof.

WEISS (O.S.)

Take some time...

JOHN

No -- I've beaten things,

insurmountable things, things most

people have never even heard of

and after all that you think I'm

going to be done in by THIS?

(CONTINUED)

32.

DR. ARCHER

You wouldn't be the first, John.

JOHN

It can't be that simple. I mean

come on, Les, you saved me before.

You can do it again, right.

DR. ARCHER

This is different. This is

aggressive.

DR. ARCHER

Twenty years ago you didn't want

to be here. Now you don't want to

leave.

JOHN

That's because I know exactly

where I'm going this time.

ANGELA

(rushing toward it)

Wait, hold the door!

ANGELA

Going down?

(CONTINUED)

33.

JOHN

Not if I can help it.

34.

ELLIE (O.S.)

Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!

ELLIE

That's funny as shit, John.

JOHN

As if you guys didn't have

something to do with it...

ELLIE

Hey, I think you brought this one

on yourself.

ELLIE

Now why wouldn't you trust me?

JOHN

I don't know, something in the

air --

ELLIE

Don't worry, John, you'll beat

this. You beat everything.

JOHN

Not this time, Ellie.

ELLIE

Oh wow, you're serious... No

wonder the Boss is in such a good

mood.

JOHN

Yeah, I thought maybe you could

talk to him for me. You know...?

(CONTINUED)

35.

ELLIE

What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe

you but to even ASK that? All

those saints and martyrs slipping

through his grasp -- his own foot

soldiers sent back to him in

chunks. He's going to take all

that out on you, John, and he's

going to enjoy ripping your soul

to shreds until the end of time.

JOHN

So I take that as a 'no?'

ELLIE

You're the one soul the man

himself would actually come up

here to collect. And you know how

much he despises this place.

JOHN

I'm starting to see his point.

ELLIE

Have you gone to see the Snob?

ELLIE

Look, don't let your ego get in

the way on this. I'd miss having

someone up here I can... relate

to.

(CONTINUED)

36.

JOHN

I'm sure I can get you in here.

CHAZ

Pass.

ATTENDANT

Can I take your coat, Mr.

Constantine?

JOHN

No thanks, I'm not staying long.

ATTENDANT

How about you, ma'am?

ANGELA

I'm not staying long either.

ANGELA

My business with him is urgent.

JOHN

First come, first served.

(CONTINUED)

37.

ANGELA

So you're rude no matter where you

are.

ANGELA

Why is he stalling on this? My

sister needs a Catholic funeral.

FATHER GARRET

Angela, it's still considered a

mortal sin --

ANGELA

She didn't commit suicide.

FATHER GARRET

The Bishop has read otherwise.

ANGELA

Father... David -- this is Isabel.

(meeting his eyes)

Please...

FATHER GARRET

I'll talk to him again.

GABRIEL

(without looking back)

I know what you want, son.

(CONTINUED)

38.

JOHN

Been keeping your all-seeing eye

on me, have you?

GABRIEL

I could offer how a shepherd leads

even the most wayward of his flock

but it might sound disingenuous.

JOHN

So you're going to make me beg?

GABRIEL

It wouldn't help. You've already

wasted your chance at redemption.

JOHN

What about the minions I've sent

back, the souls that I've saved --

that should guarantee my passage

across --

GABRIEL

(keeping it private)

-- No -- passage requires faith

and faith by definition is belief

without proof. You have proof.

And that means you're not playing

by the same rules as everyone

else. Your work has mostly been

for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.

JOHN

This is bullshit -- bullshit!

JOHN

It's like you've got some cosmic

scale weighing everything we do --

help an old lady across the

street -- put in a nickel, kick a

dog, take out a dime -- you're

fucking nickel and diming us to

death down here!

GABRIEL

Keep your voice down.

(CONTINUED)

39.

JOHN

And you know what, you're the ones

with the problem, not us -- You make

these impossible rules to decide who

goes up, who goes down and you don't

even understand us --

GABRIEL

Each of you is born with the

promise of salvation preordained.

The cost of your redemption is

simple belief. And yet you whine

about impossible rules. Sometimes

I imagine you hardly deserve the

gift you have been given.

JOHN

Gift?! More like a curse the way

you manage things.

GABRIEL

I am taking your situation into

account, John, but don't push me.

JOHN

Why me, Gabriel? It's personal,

isn't it? I didn't go to church

enough? I didn't pray enough? I

was five bucks short in the

collection plate? Why?

GABRIEL

You're going to die because you

smoked 30 cigarettes a day since

you were 15. And you're going to

Hell because of the life you took.

Or to put it in a way that your kind

would understand. You're fucked.

(CONTINUED)

40.

JOHN

He has a rotten sense of humor.

(steps past)

And his punch lines are killers.

CHAZ

(shouting out)

John?   It's raining! Hey!

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

41.

VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)

Hey, buddy, you got a light?

OLD MAN

(coughs)

We gotta stick together, right?

(CONTINUED)

42.

ANGELA

I'm sorry, Isabel...

ISABEL (V.O.)

(on TV)

Constantine.

JOHN

A few months, maybe a year.

That's it. End of story. Game

over.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

43.

JOHN (CONT'D)

(as Midnite doesn't

react)

Well, don't break down on my

account.

MIDNITE

What do you want from me?   A

shoulder to cry on?

JOHN

This bastard attacked me right out

in the open -- on Sepulveda no

less.

MIDNITE

They don't like you, John. You've

deported how many back to Hell?

JOHN

That's just it -- this wasn't some

possession or wayward half breed,

it was a full-fledged demon.

Here. On our plane.

MIDNITE

Right.

JOHN

I know what I saw.

MIDNITE

You must have just crossed over

and didn't even realize it --

JOHN

I didn't cross over -- It was on

this side. Here.

MIDNITE

-- it's wet out, you're wandering

around aimlessly, not to mention

completely emotional --

JOHN

Emotional?!

(CONTINUED)

44.

MIDNITE

Okay, so you saw something. We've

seen a few small ones slip through

now and then.

JOHN

It's more than that... first the

girl, then this.

MIDNITE

John, you know my connections.

Any shifts or tremors in the

planes and I'd hear about it.

JOHN

Something's coming.

(CONTINUED)

45.

ANGELA

L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello?

46.

JOHN

Welcome to my life.

ANGELA (O.S.)

Mr. Constantine?

ANGELA

I saw you at --

JOHN

-- I remember.

ANGELA

And --

JOHN

Yeah.

(CONTINUED)

47.

ANGELA

I'd like to ask you a few

questions.

JOHN

I'm not really in the talking mood

right now.

ANGELA

Could you just listen then?

ANGELA

Please?

JOHN

Always a catch...

ANGELA

My sister was murdered last week.

JOHN

Sorry to hear...

ANGELA

Her name was Isabel.   Isabel

Dodson?

ANGELA

You don't remember her?

JOHN

Never met her.

ANGELA

You sure?

JOHN

She look anything like you?

(as Angela nods)

I would've remembered.

(CONTINUED)

48.

ANGELA

She was a patient at Ravenscar.

Then last Tuesday she just decided

to step off the roof.

JOHN

I thought you said she was murdered?

ANGELA

Isabel would never take her own life.

JOHN

You'd be surprised at what people

will do.

ANGELA

Look, I know I'm not making much

sense -- hell I'm not really sure

what I'm doing here... I just

feel -- the circles you travel

in -- the occult, demonology,

exorcisms...

ANGELA

I believe someone got to her, Mr.

Constantine, brainwashed her into

stepping off that roof. Some kind

of legion or cult.

JOHN

Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.

ANGELA

Well I thought with your

background and experience, you

could at least point me in the

right direction.

JOHN

Yeah, okay.   Sure.

ANGELA

My sister always talked about a

world better than this. Heaven as

some call it. She wasn't afraid

of dying because she knew it was

waiting for her. What everyone

fails to grasp is that if she had

really taken her own life --

(CONTINUED)

49.

JOHN

-- she would have committed a

mortal sin and her soul would have

gone straight to Hell where it

would never feel love or

compassion or anything but pain

again as the master himself rips

her apart over and over for the

rest of eternity.

(beat)

That about right?

ANGELA

You're not the only one afraid of

Hell.

JOHN

Oh shit...

JOHN (O.S.)

Detective!

JOHN

How open is your mind?

(CONTINUED)

50.

JOHN

Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?

(off no answer)

How about what comes out of each?

JOHN

Hey!

ANGELA

You mean like angels?

JOHN

And demons.

JOHN

See, you don't have the mindset

for this kind of work.

ANGELA

Look, I see terrible things every

day. A mother drowns her baby. A

ten-year-old shoots his father.

But it's not demons, it's the evil

that men do.

JOHN

You're right, we're capable of

terrible things but we usually

justify it with motives like money

and power and jealousy.

JOHN

Then sometimes, something comes

along and gives us just the right

nudge and we do truly evil things

just for the kick of it.

(CONTINUED)

51.

ANGELA

I don't believe in demons.

JOHN

You should.   They believe in us.

JOHN

We should go...

JOHN

Fast.

ANGELA

What is that?

(CONTINUED)

52.

JOHN

Wings.

ANGELA

Wings?

JOHN

And maybe talons.

ANGELA

Are you kidding? Of what?

JOHN

Something that's not supposed to

be here.

JOHN

Close your eyes.

ANGELA

Why?

JOHN

Suit yourself.

(CONTINUED)

53.

JOHN

(to himself)

'I accidentally crossed over?'    I

don't think so.

ANGELA

(coming up behind)

What was that? I saw wings -- and

teeth -- they were flying. What

the hell were those things?!

JOHN

They weren't angels.

JOHN

Seplavites, actually. Scavengers

for the damned.

(off her lost look)

Demons?

ANGELA

What? You can't be serious...

this is impossible...

JOHN

Yeah...

(to himself)

And I don't think they were after

me...

JOHN

You really believe she wouldn't

commit suicide?

ANGELA

(a bit thrown)

My sister?

(a beat)

Never in a million years.

(CONTINUED)

54.

JOHN

Let's be sure.

ANGELA

How?

JOHN

Simple.   See if she's in Hell.

ANGELA

These are all Isabel's things.

JOHN

The cat too?

ANGELA

Yeah, why...?

ANGELA

Don't you need candles and a

pentagram for this to work?

JOHN

(deadpan)

Why, do you have any?

JOHN

I need you to step outside now.

(CONTINUED)

55.

JOHN

Angela?   Please.

JOHN

Is she here?

JOHN

Is she here?!

(CONTINUED)

56.

JOHN

IS SHE HERE?!

JOHN

It's a simple question!    Is she

here or not?!!

JOHN

Isabel?

JOHN (O.S.)

(weakly)

Angela... come back in...

ANGELA

John?     What happened?

(CONTINUED)

57.

ANGELA

How?   How did you do this...?

JOHN (V.O.)

When I was a kid, I saw things...

JOHN (V.O.)

Things I wasn't supposed to.

(CONTINUED)

58.

WAITRESS (O.S.)

Coffee?

JOHN

Tea.

JOHN

My parents sent me to a doctor, a

shrink, a priest. I was in four

different institutions by the time

I was eighteen.

JOHN

The last place they put me was run

by a church...

JOHN (V.O.)

The revered Father made the

brilliant deduction that I was

possessed, said I needed to be

exorcised...

JOHN (V.O.)

It was like someone trying to pull

teeth that weren't there.

59.

JOHN

So I took things into my own hands

and I found a way out.

ANGELA

You attempted suicide.

JOHN

I never attempt anything.

ANGELA

But you're still here.    Alive.

JOHN

Not my doing.

60.

JOHN (V.O.)

Officially I was dead for seven

minutes. But believe me, seven

minutes in Hell is a lifetime.

SECURITY GUARD

Hey, what're you doing in here?

JOHN (V.O.)

When I returned I didn't just see

demons anymore, I could do the one

thing they couldn't -- come and go

as I please.

HENNESSEY

Be there, John... please...

(CONTINUED)

61.

JOHN (V.O.)

Heaven and Hell are right here,

behind every wall, every face --

the world behind the world. It's

crossing over that's the real

trick. That's why most demons can

only whisper in our ears. But

even a whisper can turn your

favorite pleasure into your worst

nightmare.

MAITRE D'

Sir, you need a reservation!

JOHN (V.O.)

But the worst demons are the ones

that are allowed to be here -- the

ones that are half-human so they

blend in...

(CONTINUED)

62.

JOHN (V.O.)

... just like those with the

angel's touch living alongside of

us. The half-breeds.

JOHN (V.O.)

They call it 'the Balance.' I

call it hypocritical bullshit.

JOHN

So when one of them gets a little

cocky, peddles their influence or

hijacks a soul -- I deport their

scaly ass right back to Hell.

(takes a sip of tea)

I don't get them all but maybe

enough to insure my retirement.

ANGELA

Sounds like you're trying to buy

your way into Heaven.

JOHN

Well, what would you do if you

were sentenced to a prison where

half the inmates were put there by

you?

ANGELA

Why you? I mean many go to Hell,

why were you able to escape?

(CONTINUED)

63.

JOHN

(sips tea)

I don't know.

ANGELA

God has a plan for all of us.

JOHN

Not for me.

ANGELA

Isabel saw things too.

ANGELA

Detective Dodson here.

WEISS (O.S.)

Security Guard spotted him near

the body, chased him out.

WEISS

He comes over here, makes a run at

the entire menu and pow --

deflates like a fricken Macy's day

balloon.

(CONTINUED)

64.

JOHN

Shit...

(sympathetic)

Why didn't you call me, you fat

sonna bitch...

JOHN

(to Hennessey)

Rest in peace, Father.

JOHN (V.O.)

I need to see where Isabel died.

(CONTINUED)

65.

ANGELA (V.O.)

Seances, crystals -- channeling...

Our father thought she was just

trying to get attention. She

certainly did that.

ANGELA

She'd tell everyone about things

she said she saw. Crazy things.

Things that hadn't happened yet.

She'd scare my mother to death,

talking on and on about

Revelations and the end of the

world. Then one day she just

stopped... never said another

word.

JOHN

So you put her in here.

JOHN

Show me her room.

NURSE

Barry!

NURSE

Oh God...

(CONTINUED)

66.

NURSE

No, Barry, that's not Isabel.

NURSE

I'm sorry. They were friends. He

kind of had a crush on your sister.

JOHN

You were twins.

JOHN

So how long?

ANGELA

Two months.

(beat)

This time.

ANGELA

I already did all that.

ANGELA

Now you're insulting me.

JOHN

You don't walk off a building

without leaving something behind.

ANGELA

You saw everything she left

behind. In that box.

(CONTINUED)

67.

JOHN

Maybe she left something else.

Something more personal. Just for

you.

JOHN

You were her twin, Angela.    Twins

tend to think alike.

ANGELA

I'm not like my sister.

JOHN

But you were at once time. When

you were kids. When you'd spend

every waking hour with each other.

You'd start a sentence, she'd

finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd

cry.

ANGELA

That was a long time ago...

JOHN

That kind of bond doesn't just

disappear.

ANGELA

There's nothing here.

JOHN

She planned her death in this

room, she thought it up right

where you're standing --

JOHN

She knew you'd come -- She counted

on you to see what she saw, to

feel what she felt -- to do what

she did. What did she do, Angela?

ANGELA

How should I know?

JOHN

What did she do, Angela?

(CONTINUED)

68.

ANGELA

I don't know!

JOHN

What would you do?

JOHN

What would you leave her? What

would it be? Where would it be?!

Where would it be?

ANGELA

The tree.

ANGELA

(trying to

rationalize)

There must have been a tree in our

backyard... when we were kids...

JOHN

'COR 14:01.'

ANGELA

Cor?

JOHN

Corinthians.

(CONTINUED)

69.

ANGELA

(shaking her head)

There is no 14h act in Corinthians.

JOHN

I need a church.

JOHN

Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the

book of Ethenius. It's like a

dark mirror of the Bible. It

paints a different view of

Revelations, says that the world

will not come to an end at the

hand of God but be reborn in the

embrace of the damned.

ANGELA

There's a difference?

JOHN

Depends on which side of the fence

you're standing.

ANGELA

So why haven't I seen this book

before?

JOHN

Because it doesn't exist here on

this side.

ANGELA (O.S.)

What do you mean --

70.

ANGELA

-- not here on this side?

ANGELA

Where did that come from?

JOHN

(stopping to read)

13:29. 13:30 -- Here...

Corinthians 14:01...

(skimming to this)

'The sins of the father would only

be exceeded by the ego of the

son.'

ANGELA

Whose son?

JOHN

Symbol isn't a demon's... that's

why I couldn't place it... not a

normal possession...

ANGELA

John, what are you talking about?

JOHN

But he can't cross over --

impossible for the son to cross

over...

ANGELA

Whose son?   God's?

(CONTINUED)

71.

JOHN

No.  The other one.

(off her look)

Lucifer had a son too.

BEEMAN (O.S.)

Oh my...

BEEMAN

This is not good...

BEEMAN

John?

72.

JOHN (V.O.)

The myth says Mammon was conceived

before his father's fall from

grace but was born after.

JOHN

But unlike his old man, he's never

been in the presence of the Creator

so he has no fear of him, no respect

either. That goes double for us --

God's most prized creations. Mammon

would be the last demon we'd ever

want crossing over.

ANGELA

But demons can't come and go,

that's what you said.

JOHN

Unless they found a bridge.

(off her look)

Some psychic with the chops to

reach all the way to Hell and the

grit to withstand whatever shit

she'd pull out.

ANGELA

Isabel...

JOHN

But even a bridge wouldn't help

Mammon. Because to cross over, the

myth says he'd still need the one

thing he could never get. Divine

assistance. The help of God.

ANGELA

So it's impossible.

JOHN

Impossible? Sure it's impossible.

That's what makes it so dangerous.

These things exist to break the

rules, to find the loopholes. If

the past is any indication, then

the future isn't on our side.

(CONTINUED)

73.

ANGELA

She knew. That's why she killed

herself. But it doesn't make

sense...

JOHN

Makes sense to me.

ANGELA

John, she sacrificed herself to

beat him.

ANGELA

Why is she in Hell?

JOHN

Beeman?

(CONTINUED)

74.

JOHN

(pounds on door)

Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!

ANGELA

Maybe he's not here.

JOHN

He's always here.

ANGELA

What?

JOHN

Oh Jesus, no --

ANGELA

(stepping back)

Oh God --

JOHN

Who are you?! Answer me!!

Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I

summon you!

(CONTINUED)

75.

JOHN

Into the light I command thee!!

Into the light I --

JOHN

... this is my fault... I sent

them in... I sent them right to

their deaths... a damn one-man

plague.

ANGELA

John, you need a doctor.

JOHN

I've seen a goddamn doctor!!

JOHN

Get away from me!!

ANGELA

John?

JOHN

Stay the hell away --

(tortured look to her)

Please --

(CONTINUED)

76.

ANGELA (O.S.)

There were no trees in our back

yard.

ANGELA

But you knew that already, didn't

you?

ANGELA

(walking towards him)

You see something in me...

Something Isabel had.

JOHN

Go home, Angela.

ANGELA

I need to understand --

ANGELA

Why not?

JOHN

Because you open up to that world,

you're inviting whatever's out

there back in. That's what

happened to Isabel.

ANGELA

I'm not Isabel.

JOHN

No, she embraced her gift while

you denied yours and that denial

is exactly why you're still alive.

Stick with me, that'll change.

JOHN

And I don't need another ghost

following me around.

(CONTINUED)

77.

ANGELA

Dammit, John -- they killed my

sister!

ANGELA

I can't let them get away with

that. Even if it means going down

the same path she did. Now if you

won't help me get there, I'll find

my own way. But I won't run.

Never.

ANGELA

Please...

JOHN

You do this, there's no turning

back. You see them -- they see

you. Understand?

ANGELA (O.S.)

Do I take off my clothes or leave

them on?

(a beat)

John?

JOHN (O.S.)

I'm thinking.

ANGELA (O.S.)

John.

JOHN (O.S.)

On is fine.

(CONTINUED)

78.

ANGELA

Why water?

JOHN

It's the universal conduit.

Lubricates the transition from one

plane to another. Now ask me if

there's water in Hell.

JOHN

Sit.

JOHN

Normally only a portion of the

body has to be suspended but you

wanted the crash course...

ANGELA

(teeth chattering)

What will I see?

JOHN

Lie down.

ANGELA

(gesturing the depth)

Lie down?

JOHN

You have to be fully submerged.

ANGELA

For how long?

JOHN

As long as it takes.     Here --

JOHN

Last chance...

(off her look)

Take a deep one.

(CONTINUED)

79.

ANGELA

All those people... so sad...

(CONTINUED)

80.

ANGELA

... I've always known... where the

bad guys are... where to aim, when

to duck... it's not luck... I've

always known...

JOHN

Angela?

ANGELA

It was rolling toward him -- not a

ball -- something smaller. Shiny.

JOHN

Balthazar.

(CONTINUED)

81.

ANGELA (V.O.)

Can you kill him? What about the

Balance?

JOHN

That half-breed tipped my scales

when he started killing my

friends. I'm just adding a little

counterweight.

ANGELA

What about me?    I can't stay here

forever.

JOHN

Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

ANGELA

So I'm going.

JOHN

(knows he can't win)

You're staying in the car.

82.

JOHN (O.S.)

This shouldn't take long.

(CONTINUED)

83.

YOUNG TURK

(into phone)

Hey, early bird is a fat bird,

know what I'm sayin'?

PRETTY BOY

What are we pushing today, sir?

BALTHAZAR

Phillip Morris.

JOHN

How's he doing it?

BALTHAZAR

This is in direct violation of the

Balance!

JOHN

Screw the Balance.

(CONTINUED)

84.

JOHN

How's he doing it, you half-breed

shit?!

(CONTINUED)

85.

BALTHAZAR

I will see you very soon...

JOHN

Not really, no.

BALTHAZAR

You can't cheat it this time...

you're going back to Hell.

JOHN

True.   But you're not.

BALTHAZAR

What are you doing?

JOHN

I'm reading you your last rites.

BALTHAZAR

Your remedial incantations have no

relevance to my kind.

JOHN

Aren't you half human?

JOHN

You see, that makes you eligible

to be forgiven. You do know what

it is to truly be forgiven? To be

welcomed into the kingdom of God?

JOHN

A demon in heaven -- love to be a

fly on that wall...

BALTHAZAR

You're not a priest, you have no

power...

(CONTINUED)

86.

JOHN

-- I escaped hell, who else do you

know that has the power to do

that?!

JOHN

Just tell me how Mammon is

crossing over and you can go back

to your shithole.

JOHN

'May the merciful God have mercy

on you and grant you the pardon of

all your sins...'

JOHN

'Whosoever sins you remit on earth

they are remitted unto them in

heaven. I absolve you from -- '

BALTHAZAR

-- It may not even work...

JOHN

How?   How's he doing it?!

JOHN

(bellowing out)

'Grant your child entry into thy

kingdom in the name of the Father,

and the Son and the Holy Gh -- '

BALTHAZAR

... Sangre de dio.

JOHN

How?

(CONTINUED)

87.

BALTHAZAR

What killed the Son of God will

give birth to the son of the

devil.

JOHN

He's found the Spear.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, we've been

cleared for landing. Please make

sure your seats are in their

upright and locked position.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)

We should be on the ground in Los

Angeles within ten minutes.

ANGELA

Something's coming...

(CONTINUED)

88.

JOHN

What happened to staying in the

car?

ANGELA

You were in danger.

JOHN

Well now there's a premonition.

BALTHAZAR

One more chance...

JOHN (V.O.)

Jesus didn't die from being nailed

to a cross.

JOHN

He was finished off by a soldier's

spear.

ANGELA

I'm Catholic, John -- I know the

crucifixion story.

(CONTINUED)

89.

JOHN

Then you know what this spear

would mean to a demon trying to

cross over.

JOHN

The stains on its edges?

JOHN

Mammon needed divine assistance --

how's the blood of God's only son?

ANGELA

So that's it -- he's got

everything he needs to escape...

JOHN

Not quite.

(glances at her)

Twins.

JOHN

Here we go --

ANGELA

What is that?

JOHN

A hound on the hunt.

JOHN

Hang on --

(CONTINUED)

90.

ANGELA

Impossible.

ANGELA

I lost it.

ANGELA

He's down --

JOHN

He's not down.   Gimme your phone.

graffiti instead of urine but

they're still very much animals.

CHAZ

This is a private line -- John?!

JOHN

Chaz -- where are you?!

CHAZ

Ah... 3rd and Figueroa.

JOHN

You still got that Sedrallus?

CHAZ

(glancing to couple)

Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right

now, John.

JOHN

Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save

my ass here!

CHAZ

(under his breath)

What else is new...

JOHN

Remember the Chalic of Enook

incident?

CHAZ

(remembering)

Oh no, no, no, not that, I just

paid off this car!

JOHN

West side of the 3rd Street

Bridge, say...

Sorry, tour's over.

CHAZ

John, he's back and he's gaining!

Of course he's gaining.

We're even.

CHAZ

Even?

MIDNITE

Mammon has been trying to climb

out of his father's shadow for

eons.

JOHN

And this time he might just make

it.

MIDNITE

(unconvinced)

Because he's got the Spear?

JOHN

And the bridge.

MIDNITE

You're giving this girl way too

much credit.

JOHN

You don't know her.

MIDNITE

And you do?   That would be a

first.

JOHN

Where's the chair?

MIDNITE

The chair?

JOHN

The delicate little number from

Sing Sing?

(CONTINUED)

96.

MIDNITE

It's a fine line that separates a

hero from a fool.

JOHN

I'll take my chances.

MIDNITE

And taint my establishment with

your blood? I don't think so.

JOHN

Midnite --

MIDNITE

You know what that device can do

to the ill-equipped --

JOHN

Midnite --

MIDNITE

-- and even in your most glorious

days your brain was never your

most powerful attribute --

JOHN

Where the hell is the chair, you

dumb shit?!

JOHN

That was the cancer talking, you

know that, right?

MIDNITE

(holds up his finger)

Once.

JOHN

What's in your bathroom, a Renoir?

MIDNITE

I have insurance issues.

MIDNITE

You haven't surfed in decades.

JOHN

Like riding a bike...

MIDNITE

You'll be lucky to reach an

elemental plane.

JOHN

Then just increase the juice.

MIDNITE

In your condition your body won't

take much.

JOHN

I just need enough rope to find

her.

MIDNITE

And if you do -- what then?

JOHN

One goddamn problem at a time --

JOHN

You want me to sign a waiver?

(CONTINUED)

98.

JOHN

Hang on, Angela.

MIDNITE (V.O.)

Listen to my voice inside...

MIDNITE

I'll try and guide you out.

JOHN

Try?

MIDNITE

Mammon was forced out of that girl

when she jumped so unless he found

a holding vessel to wait in, he

would have fallen back to Hell.

JOHN

No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.

MIDNITE

Then watch yourself. He could be

in anyone out there.

JOHN

Roach wings? What happened to

using lilac pedals -- ?

99.

MIDNITE

Peter do caelis, Deus, misere

find them and follow...

Ravenscar. The abandoned wing.

He's in the boy.

MIDNITE

You know these won't kill them.

MIDNITE

You probably won't even get close

enough to use them.

MIDNITE

And it's not just the boy.

MIDNITE

You better worry about whoever's

helping him.

MIDNITE

As much as I admire your blind

faith even in the most dire

situations -- expecting to just

waltz into a facility that is

about to become the floodgate of

Hell is reaching a bit, even for

you.

MIDNITE

Well I suppose two fools can die

just as easily as one.

MIDNITE

Hey, you think I'm trusting you to

save the world?

MIDNITE

But we're going to need more than

a few magic bullets to get inside.

That ritual you do with the water,

MIDNITE

Figures.

Okay -- let's cut the scratch and

call it a night. Meeting's over.

JOHN

Ellie?

ELLIE

Oh, John, you know how much I love

it on this side. This was just an

opportunity to make it permanent.

JOHN

You think his son will be any

different? He'll just turn this

place into his own Hell and then

where will you to party, Heaven?

ELLIE

No need to get nasty.

JOHN

Never bothered you before.

ELLIE

I am so going to miss our little

trysts.

JOHN

I'm sure you will.

JOHN

Now turn around and take your

friends with you.

JOHN

I will deport you.   All of you.

You know I can.

Oh, John, this is embarrassing.

Where is your pride?

Go to Hell.

Holy water!

I'm not going back there!

Gabriel?

And the wicked shall inherit the

Earth.

GABRIEL

You presume to judge me, John.

JOHN

Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call

me provincial.

GABRIEL

I am seeking to inspire humankind

to be all that was intended.

JOHN

By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good

thinking...

(CONTINUED)

109.

GABRIEL

You've had it too easy for too

long.

JOHN

So what's a few thousand years of

pain, right?

GABRIEL

You never deserved to be blessed.

You've all been born with a silver

spoon in your mouth, never really

appreciating the gift you were

given so freely -- unconditional

love from your creator.

JOHN

And that just bugs the shit out of

you.

GABRIEL

It's not your fault. Like the

animals you are, you never learn

unless sufficiently prodded.

Pleasure has no lasting effect.

But subject you to pain,

unpleasantness -- suffering -- and

you will take notice, you will

fight to overcome, to earn your

redemption. That is when you're

at your best.

JOHN

You're trying to teach us a

lesson?

GABRIEL

No, I'm giving you the chance to

rise above the suffering and truly

earn the love of God.

(a beat)

The road to salvation begins

tonight. Right now.

JOHN

(whispering)

... I know I'm not one of your

favorites... I'm not even allowed

in your house these days... but I

could use a little attention...

GABRIEL

Cross the bridge to your destiny...

Hurry...

SATAN (O.S.)

The time has come at last to

collect your soul.

SATAN

Hello, John.

JOHN

You're early.

SATAN

You're the one show I wouldn't

miss.

JOHN

So I've heard.

SATAN

I didn't think you'd make the same

mistake twice.

SATAN

You didn't, did you?

JOHN

... so how's your son?

SATAN

And why would that matter to you?

JOHN

... he's topside...

SATAN

I know.

JOHN

With Gabriel.

SATAN

Your point?

JOHN

He's helping your son create his

own Hell on Earth...

SATAN

Well, boys will be boys...

JOHN

He has the Spear of Destiny.

SATAN

This is another one of your cons.

JOHN

Go look for yourself...

JOHN

You've waited twenty years for me,

what's another twenty seconds?

SATAN (O.S.)

Gabriel?

SATAN

Say goodbye to the sun -- both of

you.

GABRIEL

No!!!!!!!!

114.

SATAN

So... what do you want?   An

extension?

JOHN

Isabel...

SATAN

What about her?

JOHN

SATAN

You would give up your life so she

could go to Heaven?

SATAN

Fine.

(closes, opens eyes)

It's done.

SATAN (V.O.)

Time to go.

115.

SATAN

The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE

BELONGS TO ME!!

SATAN

You will live, John Constantine,

you will live so you'll have the

chance to prove that your soul

truly belongs in Hell. You will

live!

(CONTINUED)

116.

JOHN

Human...

JOHN

You don't deserve to be human.

GABRIEL

Then pass judgment on me now.

GABRIEL

Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my

life.

GABRIEL

Kill me! Pull the trigger!     Be

the hand of God!

JOHN

... and I'll be condemned again...

GABRIEL

Do it!

(CONTINUED)

117.

JOHN

You're even worthless as bait.

GABRIEL

Deny your true nature today, but

what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow

after that? It is only a matter

of time before you end up right

back where you belong. It is who

you are, Constantine. Damned.

JOHN

That's called pain.    Get used to it.

ANGELA

Thank you, John.

118.

JOHN (V.O.)

Some people are born to make a

difference. I had to die. Twice.

MATCH CUT TO:

JOHN (V.O.)

God does work in mysterious ways.

119.

JOHN (V.O.)

Some people like it...

JOHN (V.O.)

Some people don't.

FADE OUT.
