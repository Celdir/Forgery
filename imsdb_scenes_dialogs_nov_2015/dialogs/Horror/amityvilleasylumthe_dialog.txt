MIXTER

Lisa Templeton?

LISA

Me! Sorry-

LISA

Shit!

LISA

Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

say that!

MIXTER

It's quite alright. I'm Doctor

Elliot Mixter. Come into my office.

CUT TO:

MIXTER

Please, take a seat.

LISA

I've uh... brought my resume and

some references. I know I already

sent a copy with my application but

just in case.

7.

MIXTER

Thank you.

MIXTER

Very good. I see you've had lots of

experience cleaning private homes.

LISA

Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of

them.

MIXTER

Well an institution such as this

one is a very different

proposition.

LISA

Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've

also worked cleaning a school, so I

am used to big areas.

MIXTER

Yes I've seen that. When I say this

is a different proposition I mean

in terms of the sensitivity

required due to the nature of what

we do here.

LISA

Oh yes, yes of course.

MIXTER

You would mainly be working night

shifts at a time when patients are

on lock down. But many of our

patients here have psychological

disturbances so there may be

situations where you have to clean

up things you may not be used to

cleaning up. If you know what I'm

saying.

LISA

I know what you mean, yes.

MIXTER

Would that bother you?

LISA

It may be strange at first but I

actually have some experience in

MIXTER

LISA

I really admire that and I promise

I would not let you down if I was

given this job.

MIXTER

I'm sure you wouldn't.

LISA

Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!

MIXTER

It's quite alright, please sit

down, I can take care of it.

MIXTER

Okay... well thanks for coming in.

I'll let you know.

LISA

Look I'm so sorry, I really am!

MIXTER

It's fine. We'll be in touch.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA

Hello?

NANCY (O.S)

Hey hun!

LISA

Hey Nancy.

NANCY (O.S)

How did it go today?

LISA

It was a total fucking disaster!

NANCY (O.S)

Oh I'm sure you're just being silly

hun! Whenever I've gone for an

interview I always come out

thinking it's gone really badly.

But I bet it went better than you

think.

LISA

I sneezed on the head of the

institution.

NANCY (O.S)

You what??

LISA

I sneezed on him! It was one of

those sneezes that just sneaks up

on you, I didn't have time to cover

my face. Before you know it he's

covered in my snot!

NANCY (O.S)

Oh God I'm sorry hun.

LISA

Go on, go ahead. You know you want

to!

NANCY (O.S)

[HYSTERIAL LAUGHTER]

LISA

Laugh it up, it's gonna be your

last chance because I'm not going

for any more job interviews! I'm

done, I'm always so damn nervous

and I just don't make a good first

impression.

NANCY (O.S)

LISA

Not really. I just think I'm gonna

get myself a nice big tub of ice

cream from the freezer and watch

some TV.

NANCY (O.S)

Comfort eating!

LISA

[Smiles] I know but if there's ever

a good time for ice cream it's

today!

NANCY (O.S)

Can't argue with that! Give me a

call tomorrow, let's go for coffee

soon yeah?

LISA

Sure. Night.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LISA

Hello?

MIXTER (O.S)

Lisa this is Doctor Mixter at High

Hopes Hospital.

LISA

Really? Oh, I uh... Hi!

MIXTER (O.S)

Hello! I'm just calling you to say

it was great to meet you today and

I'd like to offer you the job.

13.

MIXTER (O.S)

Are you there?

LISA

Um... is this a joke or something?

MIXTER (O.S)

No joke, I'd like to offer you the

job.

LISA

Seriously?

MIXTER (O.S)

Absolutely.

LISA

Oh my God I... I can't believe it.

MIXTER (O.S)

I'm pleased to welcome you to High

Hopes Hospital. If you can be here

at 9am tomorrow for an induction

please and we'll go from there.

LISA

Oh God, thank you so much! I really

appreciate this, I won't let you

down!

MIXTER (O.S)

I know you won't. We'll see you

tomorrow!

LISA

Okay, see you tomorrow!

CUT TO:

14

MAN

Gswno!

MAN

Can I help you?

LISA

Yeah, I'm here for an induction

into the cleaning job.

MAN

You must be Lisa?

LISA

Yes, that's right.

MAN

Doctor Mixter said you would be

coming. I'm Delaney, we'll be

working together.

LISA

Oh great.

DELANEY

We work nights so today we'll just

show you around, okay?

LISA

Okay, thank you.

DELANEY

I'll clean this up and we'll get to

it.

CUT TO:

DELANEY

This is the storage cupboard.

Everything you will need for each

15.

LISA

DELANEY

LISA

DELANEY

LISA

OKAY

DELANEY

LISA

16

DELANEY

Yes! I think a lot of the time it's

the staff doing it, not the

patients! But we have this GumCart,

which is a bit complicated but it's

easier than just scraping the gum.

The steam is super heated to one

hundred eighty degrees and

delivered at seven point zero bar

pressure. It can produce a hundred

and fifteen litres of superheated

steam per minute.

LISA

Is it okay if I watch you use it a

few times first so I know exactly

what I'm doing? I don't want to end

up burning myself or any furniture!

DELANEY

No problem. Now here we come to the

most dangerous chemical we have.

This is a concrete cleaner, very

toxic stuff, so you have to wear

the face mask and gloves we have

here, okay?

LISA

Okay.

DELANEY

This is for cleaning and descaling

brick, stone and concrete and for

metal de-rusting. For concrete you

must mix it one part to four parts

water. Brush or spray it on with

the equipment here then leave it

five to ten minutes to set, then

rinse it off. But for those

stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use

it neat!

LISA

Okay.

DELANEY

Don't worry if anything seems

complicated, you'll get used to it.

But you'll mostly be mopping and

hoovering in your first few weeks.

17.

LISA

Yeah that's fine.

CUT TO:

DELANEY

This is Ward B, one of two wards

you'll be responsible for cleaning

each evening. Essentially the main

duties will be emptying the bins,

hoovering the carpeted areas and

mopping the hallways. The patients

in here are Category B. They're

mainly people who have had nervous

breakdowns and those who are

catatonic. They're harmless. Like

Missus Hardesty here.

DELANEY

Hello Missus Hardesty.

DELANEY

She hasn't spoken a word in all her

time here. The orderlies just lift

her from the bedroom to the day

room and back again every day.

LISA

Why did you just talk to her?

DELANEY

We've still got to treat them like

human beings. Otherwise they just

become like furniture and we all

lose our humanity. I like to think

she can hear me, even if she won't

talk to me. See you later Missus

Hardesty.

18

CUT TO:

DELANEY

The patients are locked in their

rooms on our night shift, but now

and again they might have an

accident we gotta clean up.

LISA

Okay.

DELANEY

In the day time there are nurses

who often clean up but in the night

we may be called to provide fresh

linen or mop up. Not the most

pleasant of jobs but it happens

from time to time.

LISA

Yeah I understand.

DELANEY

Now here we come to the most

difficult part of the job.

LISA

Cleaning crap up isn't the most

difficult part?!

DELANEY

Oh no, that's very easy compared to

what's behind this door.

LISA

What's behind it?

DELANEY

This leads down to Ward X.

19.

LISA

Sounds ominous.

DELANEY

You could say that. It's where

Category A patients are held. The

criminally insane.

LISA

Really? Doctor Mixter didn't

mention that.

DELANEY

Yes, well, these patients are

beyond help so they've become athe

hospital's secret. Many of them

were transferred from prisons and

other institutions. Doctor Mixter

probably thought he could help

them. He can't. The staff call this

place Blood Row.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LISA

What's that smell?

DELANEY

It always hangs in the air. No

matter how much we bleach the floor

there is always that smell of

death.

20

LISA

These patients are dangerous?

DELANEY

Yes. But don't worry, we never have

to interact directly or anything

like that. You will just be mopping

the corridor and dusting.

DELANEY

That's Jerry Kimble. He was

convicted of stabbing a young

mother forty-nine times in front of

her two year-old son, then killing

and sexually assaulting a woman

before smothering her four-year-old

daughter. They call him the Green

Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing

but was certified insane and his

lawyer got him transferred here. He

doesn't make any noise or fuss, but

he is a dangerous man. Especially

towards women. This next inmate is

even worse.

DELANEY

That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as

The Long Island Cannibal. He was

abused as a child so his targets

were always paedophiles and

rapists. He'd track them down and

torture them. He would eat parts of

their body while they were still

alive.

21.

LISA

That's horrible.

DELANEY

The most horrible thing is that a

lot of the public thought he was a

hero.

DELANEY

Sadie Krenwinkel.

LISA

What's her deal?

DELANEY

She was a member of a Witchcraft

cult. They kidnapped six people for

a demonic ritual. Five were killed

but one got away and led police to

the cult. She turned her trial into

a circus, talking about lots of

crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it

but she got certified insane by the

court. She's been around a few

institutions since. Now she's here.

LISA

Some strange stories here.

DELANEY

Well those aren't the strangest.

LISA

Really?

DELANEY

This last patient is the strangest

case.

DELANEY

This is our resident John Doe.

Sometimes we have people with

22

amnesia. Often we find out who they

are. Not so with this man.

LISA

Why is he down here?

DELANEY

They first brought him in about six

months ago. No one knows where he

came from, he literally just turned

up late one night. An orderly found

him wandering the grounds. First of

all he was like Missus Hardesty

upstairs-catatonic. Then a few

weeks later he started to respond

to Doctor Mixter and the nurses

through facial expressions and

gestures. But soon, he got violent.

Very violent. He'd have bursts of

rage and beat other patients. One

day he appeared to have a seizure

and collapsed. A young doctor tried

to take his vital signs. Patient X

here throttled him so hard he

crushed his larynx. It took six

orderlies to restrain him. Now they

won't even let him out for the

obligatory hour a day exercise. We

still don't know who he is.

LISA

Oh God.

DELANEY

God has nothing to do with this

man.

DELANEY

I haven't put you off have I?

LISA

I guess not... it's just a lot to

take in. I've obviously never been

around stuff like this before.

DELANEY

This is the reality of this place.

We don't deal with these people

directly but we may have to clean

up their mess. If you can't handle

23.

that then I understand. You know

that it's not too late to back out?

LISA

I'm not a quitter.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LISA

Ooh, you made me jump! Should you

be out of bed this late?

GIRL

I don't know.

LISA

I don't think you should be.

GIRL

Do you want to play with me?

LISA

I'd love to sweetheart, but it's

very late now. I think you better

go back to bed.

24

GIRL

Okay.

CUT TO:

LISA

Fuck!!

DELANEY

Sorry, I didn't mean to startle

you.

LISA

It's okay.

DELANEY

Are you okay?

LISA

Yeah, just hurt that's all!

DELANEY

Sorry.

LISA

I'll live.

DELANEY

Do you want to grab a coffee?

LISA

Sure.

25.

CUT TO:

DELANEY

Did you change the bins in the Day

Room?

LISA

Yeah.

DELANEY

Good. I've got a light bulb to

change in Room Twelve upstairs

soon. We're making good time.

LISA

Cool. It's funny, I never thought

I'd get this job. The interview

didn't go well!

DELANEY

Doctor Mixter told me you were the

only person he interviewed for the

job.

LISA

Really?

DELANEY

Yeah. I'm sure he felt you were

right for the job and didn't need

to interview anyone else.

LISA

Cool.

LISA

Nice tattoo.

DELANEY

Oh yeah. I forget I have it

sometimes.

26

LISA

What does it mean?

DELANEY

Well... it represents a lot of

wrong turns in my younger years.

LISA

Like what?

LISA

Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

DELANEY

It's okay. Let's just say the past

is better left there.

LISA

Fair enough.

DELANEY

So how is the first night going for

you?

LISA

Not bad. I ran into a young girl in

the hallway earlier. Sweet little

girl, she was only about twelve or

thirteen. I told her to go back to

bed. I guess they don't lock the

kids in at night huh?

DELANEY

You sure it was a young girl of

that age?

LISA

Yeah definitely. She was carrying a

teddy bear. She was about thirteen

at the most.

DELANEY

Umm... okay.

LISA

What?

DELANEY

Well... there are no children of

that age here.

27.

LISA

What?

DELANEY

In fact, there are no children of

any age in this place. I think our

youngest patient is about twenty.

LISA

You're kidding right?

DELANEY

No, I'm serious.

LISA

Then who was that girl in the

hallway?

DELANEY

You sure you saw a girl that young?

LISA

I'm positive.

DELANEY

I better tell the orderlies. This

is no place for a little girl to

be.

CUT TO:

LISA

Did you find her?

DELANEY

No.

HARDCASTLE

So you're the one who saw the

little girl huh?

28

LISA

Yes.

HARDCASTLE

You sure you saw a little girl?

LISA

Of course.

HARDCASTLE

Well I've had to pull staff off

other wards to search this goddamn

place top to bottom. We found

nothing.

LISA

That's strange.

HARDCASTLE

A big fucking inconvenience is what

it is! Do me a favour, the next

time you think you see something be

absolutely sure before you go

running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't

got time to be running around this

place looking for shit that isn't

there! You understand??

LISA

Yes.

LISA

Sorry.

DELANEY

Don't worry about it. Better safe

than sorry.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

29.

CUT TO:

DELANEY

Hey, can you do me a favour?

LISA

What?

DELANEY

Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor

Mixter's office? I've got to check

the boiler, there's been complaints

about the heating not working.

LISA

No problem.

CUT TO:

30

LISA

Doctor Mixter? Hello?

CUT TO:

PEMBERTON

What the hell are you doing in

here?

LISA

Uh... I was just emptying the

garbage.

PEMBERTON

Funny, I don't remember Doctor

Mixter keeping the garbage in the

filing cabinet.

LISA

Look I... it was just open and I ...

I dunno.

PEMBERTON

Well, y'know I'm gonna have to

report this.

LISA

Oh please don't, I didn't see

anything I just opened it.

31.

PEMBERTON

Well new girl, it's hospital policy

to report this kind of thing.

LISA

But I've only just got this job and

I really need it.

PEMBERTON

Perhaps we can come to some

arrangement.

LISA

What do you mean?

PEMBERTON

Well, I'd be doing you a big favour

if I kept this to myself. So

perhaps you can do me a favour.

LISA

What kind of favour?

PEMBERTON

A blow job.

LISA

You're disgusting!

PEMBERTON

Oh come on, I bet you'd love it.

LISA

Look, you better get out of my way

or I'm going to report you for

sexual harassment.

PEMBERTON

You've been working here for five

minutes. You really think Doctor

Mixter is gonna believe a fucking

cleaner over a medical

professional?

DELANEY

Pemberton!

32

DELANEY

Leave her alone.

PEMBERTON

She ain't no prisoner here! I was

just talking, what's the problem?

DELANEY

No problem. Lisa, come with me,

we've got a job up on Ward B.

CUT TO:

DELANEY

You okay?

LISA

I'm fine. It was just a little bit

intimidating, y'know?

DELANEY

Pemberton can be like that. He

works nights with that other son-

of-a-bitch Hardcastle. They like to

throw their weight around. You'll

get used to it.

LISA

People like that shouldn't be in

charge of patients.

DELANEY

Let's get a coffee.

LISA

You sure love your break times!

33.

DELANEY

I like to pace myself!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LISA

Missus Hardesty, you scared me!

What are you doing up at this time?

LISA

Sorry, I forgot you don't talk.

I'll just go and get an orderly.

EMERGES:

MRS HARDESTY

You're going to die in here.

LISA

What did you say?

LISA

I'll... I'll go get an orderly.

34

CUT TO:

LISA

Hi.

PEMBERTON

Well look who it is, Miss Sexual

Harassment.

LISA

Bite me.

PEMBERTON

What are you laughing at?

HARDCASTLE

This one's got a big mouth! First

ordering a search of the hospital

for a little girl, now she's

busting your balls!

LISA

Look, I don't want any trouble. I

just came to tell you there's a

patient whose out of their room in

Ward B.

HARDCASTLE

You won't get no trouble from me,

I'm a professional. Unlike this

useless bag of bones.

PEMBERTON

Fuck you!

HARDCASTLE

Catch you later sweetie.

35.

CUT TO:

HARDCASTLE

Where is this patient huh?

LISA

She was right there, in that chair.

HARDCASTLE

Who?

LISA

Missus Hardesty.

HARDCASTLE

Missus Hardesty?

LISA

Yeah. She even spoke to me!

HARDCASTLE

Missus Hardesty was here and she

spoke to you?

LISA

Yes!

HARDCASTLE

Just a second...

HARDCASTLE

The new girl here says that Missus

Hardesty was just sat in that

chair. Says she even spoke to her.

LISA

Look I know she's supposed to be

catatonic but I swear she said

something to me!

36

PEMBERTON

That's not the strange thing,

sweetheart.

LISA

What do you mean?

PEMBERTON

Missus Hardesty died this morning.

LISA

But I could have sworn...

HARDCASTLE

Listen newbie, how about you just

get on with the cleaning and stay

off the crack pipe. Okay, honey

bunny?

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA

Hello?

LISA

Little girl, wait!

CUT TO:

37.

LISA

Don't go in there!

CUT TO:

LISA

Little girl?

KIMBLE (O.S)

Palmer... Hey Palmer...

PALMER (O.S)

Yes?

KIMBLE (O.S)

My cock is so hard Palmer. It's so

hard that I can't contain it any

more. I'm going to break through

this wall and do bad things to you.

Very, very bad.

PALMER (O.S)

I must advise you Mister Kimble-

threats will not be well received.

KIMBLE (O.S)

I'm touching myself Palmer. You

wanna watch? You fucking faggot!

38

PALMER (O.S)

Stay out of my psyche Mister Kimble

and I'll stay out of yours.

KIMBLE (O.S)

I know you're out there girlie. I

can smell your pussy. How about you

join me in here. Come on!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

39.

LISA'S MOTHER

Don't you grieve for me?

LISA

Of course I do.

FIGURE

Kill them. Kill them all.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

DELANEY

Okay, next thing is mopping the

floor in Ward X.

40

LISA

Umm... could you do that?

DELANEY

Why?

LISA

I dunno... I just need a break.

DELANEY

Does Ward X frighten you?

LISA

A little.

DELANEY

That's normal, it frightens me

sometimes. But I've got to go up to

a patient's room in Ward A.

Apparently they've had a little

accident. Surely you wouldn't

prefer to clean that up?

LISA

Well... maybe not.

DELANEY

I know Ward X is a scary place. But

you'll get used to it.

LISA

I can hear them talking. It's kinda

unnerving.

DELANEY

I know, I hear that too when I'm

down there. But trust me, once you

get used to it things will get

easier.

CUT TO:

SADIE

I can hear you out there.

41.

SADIE

I've been talking to your mother

Lisa.

SADIE

She's here with me Lisa. She's told

me all about you.

SADIE

I know you're out there Lisa. Talk

to me.

LISA

What... what do you expect me to

say?

SADIE

Perhaps you can tell me all about

the summer trips to Key West with

your mother? Those were your

favourite memories of your mother

weren't they? Or perhaps you'd

prefer to tell me about when you

sat at your mother's bed side for

six months, watching on helplessly

as the cancer ravaged her body and

sucked the life out of her?

LISA

How... how do you know all this?

SADIE

Because your mother is speaking to

me from the flames of hell!

LISA

You sick fuck!

SADIE

She has a message for you Lisa.

Want to hear it?

42

SADIE

Want the message?

LISA

What is it?

SADIE

GET OUT!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DELANEY

What's wrong Lisa?

LISA

I'm not going down to Ward X again,

I'm really sorry I just can't

handle it down there!

43.

DELANEY

Okay, just calm down okay. Tell me

what happened.

LISA

They say things to me through the

doors. Horrible things!

DELANEY

I know, they've done it to me too.

LISA

But that woman Sadie, she says

things she couldn't possibly know

about me.

DELANEY

Like what?

LISA

I sound crazy don't I?

DELANEY

No. This place just gets under your

skin sometimes.

LISA

I'm starting to wonder if I'm

losing my mind.

DELANEY

Well it's not healthy to think too

much about what those crazy son-of-

a-bitches say. Believe me you don't

want them inside your head.

LISA

It's hard to keep them out

sometimes.

DELANEY

Listen, take a break from Ward X

for a while. I'll go down there for

the next week or so.

LISA

I'm really sorry about this, I

didn't think it would effect me so

much.

44

DELANEY

Don't worry, it gets to everyone at

first. But the last thing I want is

for you to dread coming to work.

LISA

Thank you. I really appreciate

that.

DELANEY

No problem.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

PEMBERTON

What's with all the fucking racket

Palmer?

PALMER

Sorry to bother you Mister

Pemberton. But I wondered if it

would be possible to get some

medical attention?

PEMBERTON

Now how the hell did that happen?

PALMER

I believe it was this rather crude

weapon that did the damage.

45.

PEMBERTON

Jesus Christ Palmer! Now put the

weapon on the floor and back away.

PEMBERTON

Put your hands on your fucking head

and face the wall! Now!!

PEMBERTON

I'm coming in dipshit, one fucking

move from you and I'll cave your

fucking skull in! You understand??

PALMER

As you wish Mister Pemberton.

CUT TO:

PEMBERTON

Don't you fucking move!!

PEMBERTON

I said don't fucking move!

PALMER

I'm terribly sorry about this.

CUT TO:

46

PALMER

Good evening Mister Kimble

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARDCASTLE

Pemberton? Pemberton, what's taking

you so long man??

CUT TO:

HARDCASTLE

Shit!

HARDCASTLE

We got a major code six over here!

47.

HARDCASTLE

Stay alert!

PALMER

Good evening gentleman. I believe

we will be one short at roll call

tomorrow morning.

DISSOLVE TO:

ORDERLY #1

Do we need to put the bit in his

mouth?

ORDERLY #2

No. We're not giving him the

methohexital either.

HARDCASTLE

What the fuck are you doing??

48

LISA

I just heard something so I ... I was

just curious.

HARDCASTLE

What are you seeing in there?

LISA

Oh nothing, I didn't see anything.

created by a loving God?

DELANEY

I don't believe that God is a

bearded man who lives in the sky.

Or that the Devil is a red demon

with horns. I believe God and Satan

are within all of us. God is our

human side. Satan is our animal

side. Whether we become good or

evil depends which side of us we

feed.

LISA

It's a frightening thing to believe

that if God exists he is not

powerful enough to stop evil.

DELANEY

Free will in the hands of a person

who feeds the Evil inside them.

That's what frightens me.

LISA

Doctor Mixter must have known what

stood on this land before the

hospital.

DELANEY

Of course he did. He bought the

land and organised the demolition

of the house himself.

LISA

Why would he build on this land

knowing the history of the place?

DELANEY

He's not superstitious. He's a

doctor, they don't usually believe

in those things. Amityville is full

of local legends, going back even

before the DeFeos.

LISA

Like what?

DELANEY

There's stories about the Native

Americans being slaughtered on this

land many years ago. Some people

62

even believed the Indian Chief

possessed that kid who killed his

family.

LISA

Really?

DELANEY

I don't think that's true. If I've

learnt anything from the patients

on Ward X, it's that some people

have a mind that works in a

different way to other people.

Those people who do bad things have

fed the evil within them more than

the good. It's not possession, it's

sickness. Sickness of the soul.

LISA

I don't know what to think.

DELANEY

Just don't let your imagination run

away with you Lisa. You're a person

who feeds that good within you.

Don't let this place feed the evil.

LISA

Hi, sorry to bother you but my

name's Lisa Templeton. I rang

yesterday to set up a meeting with

Gloria Branco.

GLORIA

Yes, that's me.

LISA

Oh great! Thank you for agreeing to

meet with me.

GLORIA

No problem, nice to meet you! I've

set up a table in the back. I've

63.

got a few books that may help you

with your inquiries.

LISA

Thank you, that's great.

CUT TO:

GLORIA

So you wanted to know about the

history of Amityville dating back

to the Native Americans?

LISA

Yes that's right. I'm writing a

college paper and I had heard some

rumours in the neighbourhood about

Native Americans being killed on

the land down on Oceans Avenue.

GLORIA

Well that area has quite a dark

history.

LISA

You mean the DeFeo murders at One

Twelve?

GLORIA

Yes. Terrible business that. Those

young children. Breaks my heart to

think about such a tragedy.

LISA

Yeah it's awful.

GLORIA

You know most of the town was very

upset when they decided to build

that mental institution on the

land. That used to be a nice

suburban neighbourhood, now there's

this big eye sore there. We had a

64

thousand names on a petition. But I

guess that Doctor who runs the

place has enough money to pay off

the people in high places.

LISA

So what about the native Americans?

Is that story about them being

killed on that land true?

GLORIA

There's something on that here.

GLORIA

Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In

the 18th Century there existed a

group of Native Americans in

Amityville known as "The Satchem

Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha,

the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem

in Massachusetts to escape

persecution by the Christians who

were persecuting members of the

tribe because of their Witchcraft

practices. These practices included

a ritualistic human sacrifice of

six people (The significance of Six

being related to the biblical

number of man and creation) in

order to induce the spirit of their

God, The Dark Master, who they

believed manifested his powers

through his devoted followers,

giving them immortality. The

hundred strong tribe settled in

Amityville but were later chased

off the land by local Christians.

Satchem accused the Christians of

not properly compensating his tribe

for the land. A war started and the

Christians hired a hunter called

John Underhill from Salem. At the

site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue

was later built in Amityville,

Underhill killed all of the tribe.

The Indians were buried in a mass

grave on the site. Before he died

Satchem vowed revenge. According to

local legend, Chief Satchem is

believed to have subsequently

haunted the land. Various

parapsychologists and mediums have

65.

claimed that Satchem's vengeful

spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo

murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue

and the haunting of the subsequent

owners. Although such assertions

are widely disputed.

LISA

So the legend has basis in

historical fact?

GLORIA

Absolutely.

CUT TO:

LISA

You told me the other night that

you think evil is within us all.

But do you think that people can be

influenced by an evil that comes

from outside of themselves?

DELANEY

Are you still thinking about this?

LISA

I guess I am yeah.

DELANEY

I worry that you're thinking too

much. This place is getting to you.

LISA

There's something going on in this

place. Something sinister. And I

don't just mean the patients on

Ward X. Have you not noticed that?

DELANEY

I've noticed some things.

LISA

Why haven't you said anything? Or

done anything?

66

DELANEY

It's like the honey bee.

LISA

What do you mean?

DELANEY

The honey bee is fine when it's

just flying from flower to flower.

Then they think that a person is a

threat and they sting them. They

might leave a sting but the person

will recover. The bee dies. So I

ask myself... is it worth it?

MIXTER

CUT TO:

MIXTER

What can I do for you Lisa?

LISA

Well... what I'm going to tell you

will sound really strange but I

need to tell you.

MIXTER

Okay, go ahead.

LISA

Do you know the history of the land

the hospital is built on?

MIXTER

What are you referring to exactly?

LISA

Well, first of all. The DeFeo

murders and the infamous house that

people said was haunted.

MIXTER

I am aware of the DeFeo murders

yes. The hauntings... well I think

it's common perception now that a

lot of that was exaggerated by the

media.

LISA

Maybe. Are you aware of the history

of the land dating back to the

eighteenth century?

MIXTER

No, I can't say that I am.

70

LISA

There were a group of Native

Americans in Amityville known as

"The Satchem Tribe". They were

massacred by Christians after a

dispute over the land.

MIXTER

Okay. I'm sure there's a point to

all this?

LISA

Yes. Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward

X. She shares the beliefs of the

Satchem Tribe. I have reason to

believe that somehow she has access

to the internet and Witchcraft

paraphernalia and she's planning on

a human sacrifice tonight to try

and raise the God she believes in,

The Dark Master, and become

immortal.

LISA

I'm serious.

MIXTER

Have you been reading up on Sadie?

It's rather outlandish stuff isn't

it? But I can assure you she has no

access to the internet or anything

else.

LISA

Go on the internet and check out

the Blog! She signs herself Sister

Sadie.

MIXTER

Well that could be anyone called

Sadie couldn't it?

LISA

Go down and search her cell!

MIXTER

I don't believe that will be

necessary. The patients on Ward X

spend twenty three hours a day in

the cell. They get an hour of

exercise in a small yard guarded by

six of our staff. There's no way

71.

MIXTER

Now Lisa, let's talk calmly or you

will be sedated again.

LISA

Why are you doing this?

MIXTER

You're having paranoid delusions.

I'm also aware that you've been

having disturbing visions.

LISA

I'm not having delusions, I know

what I've seen!

MIXTER

Well you think you know. The human

brain is a powerful thing and I'm

sure you do believe what you've

seen. But it's all in your mind

Lisa, it's not reality. You're a

very sick girl and you need

treatment.

LISA

You do this to all your staff huh?

The minute we speak out we get

fucking committed??

MIXTER

Staff? You were never staff here

Lisa. You're a patient here. You've

always been a patient here.

LISA

No, no. You're lying to me, I know

who I am! I KNOW WHO I AM!!

MIXTER

I'm afraid not my dear. You've

always been with us here. Initially

as an out patient but now the

delusions have progressed I feel

it's time for you to become a full

time resident.

74

LISA

But... but...

MIXTER

Look, I understand it's a lot to

process now. I'll leave you to

think about it and then we'll begin

counselling sessions tomorrow.

LISA

Okay.

MIXTER

Listen, how about I take this

straight jacket off so you're more

comfortable?

LISA

Thank you.

MIXTER

First you must take this. It will

help you sleep.

MIXTER

Good girl. I know it's a lot to

take in but together we'll get

through this. Now I'm going to take

your restraint off. Remember

though, if you're violent then I

promise you it will go straight

back on. Okay?

LISA

Okay.

MIXTER

That better?

LISA

Yes. Thank you.

No problem. I'm going to leave you

get some rest now. Tomorrow we

PRESENTER

And we're back with our next guest.

A year ago he was a survivor of the

High Hopes Hospital mass murder

when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran

amok with a rifle, claiming six

victims and injuring many others.

Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a

new book entitled 'Shattered Hopes'

which provides an account of that

fateful night as well as some

background into the mind of the

murderer. Doctor Mixter, good

morning.

MIXTER

Morning Katherine, how are you?

PRESENTER

I'm good thank you. So Doctor, can

you tell us a little more about the

book?

MIXTER

Well, it features a blow by blow

account of the evening. It was

obviously a very harrowing

experience and for me it was rather

therapeutic to deal with my

feelings about what happened in

writing.

PRESENTER

How has it affected the hospital

Doctor?

MIXTER

Obviously we were all left very

numb by events for a long time and

I know a lot of people in the town

felt we should close the

institution. But that never

occurred to me. I feel that people

should be brought closer by tragedy

and the Staff and I have definitely

become closer, both as colleagues

and friends, since the incident.

That bond makes for a better

87.

institution in my opinion, so we

will continue to go from strength

to strength.

PRESENTER

You mentioned there that some

people wanted the place to close. I

know many were also resistant to

the opening of the institution in

the first place given that it was

built on the site of the infamous

house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered

his family in the seventies. I know

a lot of people associated with

that case were accused of

exploiting it for their own ends.

You've also faced some criticism

for that, particularly as we heard

last week that you have sold the

movie rights to this book. How do

you respond to that criticism?

MIXTER

Well I know that some people accuse

me of hurting the memory of the

victims but I feel I'm helping the

memories of those involved live on.

Granted, some victims were

criminally insane but other victims

were loyal staff who had families

and I'm determined that they not be

forgotten. Each staff member gets

their own chapter in the book so

that the readers can get a full

picture of what wonderful people

they were. I always say that all

forms of media, whether it be

books, newspapers, TV or movies,

are a preservation of life. Our

physical bodies may die but our

images live on when we are famous.

Our work and our passion is

preserved, therefore it's as if our

souls are preserved. Through all of

these forms of media we are, in

effect, immortal.
