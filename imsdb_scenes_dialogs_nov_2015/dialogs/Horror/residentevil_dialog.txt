RESIDENT EVIL

MARCUS (filter)

Stay away from here!

MARCUS (cont. filter)

This lab must remain sealed!

MARCUS (cont. Filter)

For God's sake, don't come in!

VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)

Look.  Here.

RESIDENT EVIL

CHRIS

Take it, Goliath. It's yours.

CHRIS (cont.)

See ya next year, guy.

CHRIS (cont.)

Cleopatra.

CHRIS (cont.)

Come on. Come on down.

CHRIS (cont.)

What's the matter, beautiful?

CHRIS

(A whisper) Glad you're still

here, lady

JILL

It's my apartment.

CHRIS

(Surprised) You're awake.

JILL

I've been awake. Since you left.

CHRIS

Sorry.

CHRIS (cont.)

There was... something wrong.

JILL

What, with my dinner? I never had

a mother. I'll learn.

CHRIS

I'll do the cooking.

CHRIS (cont.)

On the mountain...there...must

have been something... prowling

around up there.

JILL

There are probably all kinds of

things prowling around up there.

In the middle of the night.

CHRIS

I'm sorry. Really. You...have to

be there at dawn. They ride the

wind over the ridge.

JILL

Dawn? You left at one A.M.

CHRIS

I had to go fishing. It's the fish

that bring them down, so I can get

a close look at them. (Enthused)

I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.

Twelve of those big bruisers. I can

actually recognize them. I've even

given them names, over the years.

JILL

You've been doing this for years?

CHRIS

Only in the early Autumn. When

they're' migrating.

JILL

I'II set the alarm for next. October.

JILL (cont.)

I wish I could get excited. Really.

That's the truth. As excited as you,

over such... simple things.

CHRIS

Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...

I'd be beautiful.

JILL

You are.

CHRIS

No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the

other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have

all that... stuff... hiding underneath

somewhere. That's what fascinates me.

JILL

Fascination. Not love?

CHRIS

I... honestly don't know. I guess

I've been... living alone too long.

You're the first, the only woman I've

ever thought of as... a real partner.

JILL

I've always been...afraid of living

alone. I've always had... people...

talking at me... knowing they could

wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...

whatever they wanted.

JILL (cont.)

We all have... something hidden...

underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.

But it's not all that complicated,

Either.  Most of the time, you find

It... right in the middle of all the...

confusion.

CHRIS

I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never

confused. At least, they never let

it show.

RAKE

Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'

around. Get in.

RAKE (cont.)

Swear. If I didn't know you was

just an animal, I'd say you was all

full of yourself. GET IN THERE!

RAKE (cont.)

What's wrong with you two?

RADIO MAN

Top brass, sir!

MAN WITH TATTOO

Alpha Leader.

VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)

How long before you get in there?

MAN WITH TATTOO

Fifteen minutes.

MAN WITH RING

You're good, soldier. But not that

good. It's five hundred miles away.

In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.

MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)

We have troopers on site. A first-

strike force. Under cover.

MAN WITH RING

Very resourceful.  You have my

permission activate them.

MAN WITH TATTOO

I've already done that. You have my

permission... to say that you gave me

permission.

JILL

(Softly) Valentine.

JILL (cont.)

If this is just another a drill,

I'll strangle you. (She listens)

Shit. Give me the activation code.

JILL (cont.)

(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's

a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.

DISIMONE

Another practice run, right?

RUSSO

We been practicin' six months!

For what?

JILL

For this. This is the real deal.

WILLIAMS

Honest to God?

JILL

Based on my experience, Williams,

God isn't always honest

DISIMONE

Where we goin'?

JILL

In there.

RUSSO

If you had the jing to build a place

like this, would you build it in the

middle of fuckin' nowhere?

WILLIAMS

Paris.

DISIMONE

Manhattan. Upper west.

JILL

(Wistfully) Some people prefer...

a quiet life. (Back to business)

Our orders are to secure the area.

DISIMONE

From what? This area's been 'secure'

since the French and Indian War!

JILL

(Into radio) This is Valentine,

Bravo Team. We, er... we might be

in trouble, here.

JILL (cont.)

WE ARE IN TROUBLE!

JILL (o.s. filter)

Under attack... by.. .assailants...

Unidentifi...

WESKER

Can you get a trace?

LAGUARDIA

Lost the beacon. It just cut out.

Like it was...swallowed by something.

WESKER

I do believe, gentlemen...that we're

gonna be earning some combat pay.

BARRY

Damn, if you don't love a fight.

WESKER

Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead

man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-

nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.

SOLDIER

Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)

You gonna be a good boy?

MAN

Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...

SOLDIER

Step aside.

SHERIFF

But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.

BULLHORN (o.s.)

There is no immediate danger, but

as a precaution, we are evacuating

the area. You will be provided

shelter until the weapons have been

removed from the crash site.

SHERRIFF

That's a worn-out scenario. If

a plane crashed nearby, don't you

think somebody would have heard

it go down? Tell us the truth,

guys. What's this really about?

SOLDIER

I said, STEP ASIDE!

WESKER

Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to

Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.

I'm going on target with Alpha Team.

All forces stand ready to support.

CHRIS

Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.

RAKE

(Coughing blood) They... they come

outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't

know what they was. Figure... maybe

some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...

RAKE

I... I never seen 'em comin'.

CHRIS

Don't try to talk, Rake.

RAKE (cont.)

I... ain't... never left this farm...

untended... since yer daddy first

took it over.

CHRIS

I know. You... kept the place runnin'...

better than me.

RAKE

I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.

Never even...had a chance to...turn

a gun on 'em.

CHRIS

Where are they going? There's

nothing in there... except...

RAKE

Y'oughta... remember it... real good.

I do.  From... when you was a kid.

CHRIS

The... the old Arkley place?

RAKE

I remember them days. I surely do...

Remember them... them old days.

CHRIS (cont.)

I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.

You're...in a bad time. If there's

any way to save you, I'll find it,

I swear. You just... hang in there,

old guy. I'll be right back.

CHRIS

Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.

CHRIS (cont.)

Sorry, old hoss.

CHRIS (cont.)

The earth keeps us.

WESKER

You'll have to rotate or you'll run

out of fuel, but I want one chopper

to remain in the air at all times.

We might need help in a hurry.

VICKERS

Holy... Goh... gaah...

AIKEN

You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?

SULLIVAN

Aiken... a guy with a brain your

size would be better off dead.

RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)

Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?

RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

I'm ready ta shoot somebody.

ALKEN

I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.

WESKER

(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)

Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found

on site. No survivors.

WESKER

We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.

WESKER

Who fired? WHO FIRED?

RODRIGUEZ

Let's get inside.

WESKER (cont.)

NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL

DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...

UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !

BARRY

Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my

ass in the desert.  I saved yours I

in Pennsylvania.

WESKER

I don't believe in being... 'Even-

Steven' with anybody.  A man saves

my ass...I pay him back.  Before

this day is over, I'll pay you back,

Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?

SPIKE #26

BARRY

Look here, man.  I'd follow you

into any kind of enemy fire.  But

these things ain't firin' at us.

They want us for breakfast!  When

are you gonna tell us what the

hell is goin' on here?

WESKER

When you need to know.  Just do

your job, soldier.  That's what

I'm doin'.  My job.

AIKEN

Old. They probably don't have cable.

SULLIVAN

They probably don't have radio.

RODRIGUEZ

Who's they? Who's place is this?

WESKER

Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built

this old fortress during prohibition.

He figured nobody'd ever find him out

here in the back woods.  Nobody did.

Till he died.  Feds have had it ever

since.  Place has been here for eighty

years... derelict... a safe-house.

BARRY

A safe-house... for who? For what?

WESKER

There's a... a secret installation.

Below.  A network of laboratories.

REBECCA

What kind of... laboratories?

WESKER

(Shrugging) They didn't issue us

gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay

to breathe.

RODRIGUEZ

Why send in a strike-force?

SULLIVAN

Yeah. What are we supposed to do?

Polish the silver?

WESKER (cont.)

There's a man downstairs. A top-

priority man.  It's our job to...

bring him out.  Hopefully, there

are others alive, as well. We'll

Rescue them, too... if we can...but

Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive

at any and all cost.

WESKER

Three men stay here. Chambers...

REBECCA

I'm not a man.

WESKER

Rodriguez...

RODRIGUEZ

I'm better than a man.

WESKER

Alright. you come with us. Aiken,

Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.

AIKEN

Why us?

SULLIVAN

I dunno why me. You? I guess the

C.O. figures you're as worthless

as a dame, Aiken.

SULLIVAN (cont.)

Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...

I meant Aiken... Not you.

REBECCA

Relax. I get it.

BARRY

That thing...tells you where to go?

WESKER

One man stays here. Ridley. You're

it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure

it's not one of us. The rest of you...

this way.

RIDLEY

Who... who's there?

RIDLEY

Who are you?

CHRIS

Who are YOU? What the hell is

S.T.A.R.S.?

RIDLEY

How'd you get in here?

CHRIS

Who sealed the door?

RIDLEY

Who knew there a door?

RIDLEY

Who... who... ?

SPEYER

Where'd that come from?

BARRY

Back...where we just were.

SPEYER

Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!

SPEYER

Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.

BARRY

That's not what killed him. Blood's

still running. Wounds are fresh.

But look at his skin. This guy's

been dead for a couple of days.

RODRIGUEZ

He was dead... before he was shot?

REBECCA (O.S.)

Ridley?

REBECCA (cont.)

Who... who are...

CHRIS

I... I'm one of the good guys, okay

I'm just trying to...

REBECCA

(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!

CHRIS

Shit.

AIKEN

Who was that?

SULLIVAN

Forget him. What are they?

CHRIS

Somebody did some major remodeling.

REBECCA

We gotta get him out!

AIKEN

What? Smart fuckin' plants?

SULLIVAN

No big deal. Most-plants are

smarter than you, Aiken.

SPEYER

Why would anyone shoot a dead man?

RODRIGUEZ

Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...

walkin' around?

BARRY

Head-shot. We were sprayin' those

dogs outside... but think about it.

Were any of 'em brought down without

a head-shot.

JILL

I lost three me.  You killed them,

Wesker. You did... and I did. Because

I didn't know what to expect... because

you... didn't tell me!

WESKER

(Calmly) Tell you what?

JILL

Anything! I wasn't told anything!

WESKER

Put down the gun.

WESKER (cont.)

Put down the gun.

JILL

Not until...

WESKER

RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!

WESKER (cont.)

How... did you get in here?

JILL

(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?

Good to see ya. Glad you're still

alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...

WESKER

How did you get in here?

JILL

(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'

dogs got out! Through their pens!

(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.

WESKER

Good thinking.

VOICE (o.s.)

MAN DOWN!

WESKER

Ladies first.

JILL

Fuck you.

RODRIGUEZ

Maybe... they're in the house.

More of them dogs.

REBECCA

Diameter's too small. It... almost

looks as if... it was done by a...

JILL

(Arriving) A human?

REBECCA

Yes, but... what kind of... human...

would do something like this?

AIKEN

Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.

SULLIVAN

Aiken, you'd be better off...

REBECCA

There was a guy. Not part of the

team. And there was... some kind

of... plant... that seemed... alive.

RODRIGUEZ

Gimme a fuckin' break.

AIKEN

No shit. It disappeared... right

into the wall.

WESKER

I guess it's... time to spill it.

WESKER (cont.)

I don't know... much more than I

already told you.  I'll tell you

the rest now.  The labs hare are...

were...working on special apps for

bio-eng1neered materials.

RODRIGUEZ

Speak English, hombre.

WESKER

Marcus has been experimenting with

an artificial... man-made... virus.

Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing

came from a private corporation, you

may have heard the name... Umbrella.

JILL

They're... multi-national. Huge.

WESKER

So huge that they have... connections...

in high places.  That's why we're here.

BARRY

This virus... it jumped, right?

SPEYER

Shit! We're all dead! We got the

bug, and we're all dead!

WESKER

It's not airborne. It was spread...

in the water supply. Lab animals

and... the researchers themselves...

passed it on... by...

JILL

By... biting.

BARRY

You catch this virus and... what?

WESKER

You die. But... not for long. The

chemical...revives the brain, and...

RODRIGUEZ

You stand back up... and chew on

the first guy you see.

SPEYER

Christ, this is like... Night of the

Living Dead!

BARRY

Why, in the name of Jesus, would

anybody wanna mess with shit...

that does that shit?

WESKER

Victory, friend. Civilization has

come a long way, but we still have...

war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't

die.  That... was the concept.

JILL

But the virus... jumped.

WESKER

Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...

we've contained it.

JILL

Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you

tell us?

WESKER

By telling you NOW, I've put your

lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this

information. Except a few high-and-

mightys. Me. And now, you.

WESKER (cont.)

We have to get Marcus out of here.

He developed this thing. He's the

only one who... understands it.

REBECCA

I don't know, this all sounds pretty

shaky to me...

RODRIGUEZ

Guess that proves it. A head-shot

knocks 'em down.

REBECCA

Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)

I... I'm a doctor! I should know!

That man was dead!

VICKERS

I hope you have a lot of these.

CHRIS

(Calling) Hey.

CHRIS (cont.)

HEY!

CHRIS (cont. )

HEADS UP!

JILL (cont.)

Hang on! We're gonna get wet!

AIKEN

Where the fuck is a shark's brain?

SULLIVAN

In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you

would be better off dead.

WESKER

Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You

set off a containment breach!

JILL

It must have been the water. God,

the water! (She turns to Chris}

Did you swallow any?

SPEYER

I did.

SULLIVAN

A bunch of us did, man.

WESKER

Separate systems. Salt water.

No germs. But.. .it breached!

WESKER (cont.)

We can go in deeper.  But we can't

get out.  Not with my card-key.

RODRIGUEZ

So...we live here now.

RODRIGUEZ (cont.}

Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my

family out of six apartments. I

got use to sayin'...'So...we live

here now'.

WESKER

There are override exits... but I

can't find them without THIS!

CHRIS

That was a smart move.

WESKER

And... you are?

CHRIS

Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...

CHRIS (cont.)

...who gets pissed-off when he finds...

his farm animals... and his father's

oldest friend... dead. And the only

woman he ever cared about turns out

to be a goddam METAL HEAD!

WESKER

Valentine...who is this asshole?

JILL

His name is Chris Redfield. He was...

part of my cover, sir.

CHRIS

Cover?

JILL

This is not the time to mouth off,

Chris! You're in deep shit here!

CHRIS

Why didn't you let me in on this?

JILL

Why did you have to come after me?

How did you get in here, anyway?

CHRIS

I used to play here, when this was

a fucking laundry room!  And what

makes you think I came after YOU?

BARRY

(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.

BARRY (cont.)

Is this the pile of shit we're

supposed to bring out of here?

WESKER

It...it once was.

VICKERS (o.s.)

I got something here.

BARRY

A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits

marked...blue and green.

WESKER

The greens are the overrides. (To

Brad) Can you print this out?

VICKERS

I can try.

VICKERS (cont.)

(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.

WESKER

We have to get down to level 'D'.

BARRY

Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this

mission was about bringin' him out,

we're outta here, right?

WESKER

I wish we were, but no. We have

a potential outbreak here. We might

be the only ones who can stop it.

SPEYER

Stop it? How?

WESKER

There's... an antidote.

WESKER (cont.)

We can't bring Marcus out, but we

can bring out the serum. Maybe

somebody...can analyze it... and

figure how to beat the virus.

JILL

(Privately) Not simple.

CHRIS

(Privately) Not complicated, either.

We only have to decide... what's right...

and what's wrong.

JILL

(Privately) I forgot. You're never

confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?

And what's wrong?

VICKERS

Shit. (At the computer) There are

no green exits on this level. Why...

why would that be?

CHRIS

They don't want anybody up here

to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.

WESKER

Pretty good guess. You must have

been in the military, son.

CHRIS

Native American. Exempted.

VICKERS

(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!

There... there's no way out!

CHRIS

Yes there is.

WESKER

Not a bad idea. (Turning to

Vickers) See if you can call

up... service charts, schematics.

VICKERS

Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.

The whole infrastructure.

WESKER

Print it. Print all of it.

REBECCA

What's that from?

VICKERS

(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the

desk. When we were scrambling.

REBECCA

Lemme look at it.

VICKERS

(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!

CHRIS

There's a... part of an old laundry

chute. It might not show on there.

It runs up to the kitchen.

WESKER

I'm not going up. I'm going down.

WESKER (cont.)

I'd like to let you guys off the

hook. But I can't. I need back

up. You're comin' with me. Any

objections?

JILL

No objections. We'll back you up.

CHRIS

(Disappointed) You said... people

wind you up and you do whatever

they want you to do.

WESKER

Stay out of this, son. You're the

only one who doesn't have a choice

in this. There's no place to lock

you up. I can't let you go, you're

a security risk. I could shoot you.

Legally. But your lady-friend would

probably get all over my ass. So...

I'm afraid you're comin' with us...

whether you like it or not. (To Jill,

pointedly) He's your responsibility,

Valentine. See that he doesn't make

trouble.

CHRIS

You up to the challenge?

JILL

Try me.

CHRIS

(Snappy) I already have.

CHRIS

Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...

angry. When I... thought you were

gone, I... Then... when I saw you.

Alive. I realized that...

JILL

That you were still... fascinated.

CHRIS

Stop. Stop!

CHRIS (cont.)

Come with me. We can get out of here.

JILL

(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...

nothing more. But... I can't. When

I'm in this uniform, I'm more than...

just me. Try to understand...there's

no "I" in Team, Chris.

CHRIS

There's no "I" in DEAD, either.

CHRIS (cont.)

I should order you to come with me.

You'd never refuse an order.

JILL

You go. You're not part of this.

CHRIS

I'm part of it as. long as you are.

BARRY (o.s.)

This is very uncomfortable.

CHRIS

For me, too, brother.

BARRY

I mean this... (indicating the

iron that's pressing his belly.)

It's very uncomfortable.

BARRY (cont.)

This is gettin' old, Man, I swear.

I been in this Army eighteen years.

CHRIS

Eighteen years?

BARRY

Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.

JILL

Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that

long if they've seen action.

BARRY

I've seen action in Granada.  And

Desert Storm.  Would have lost it

all there... if my buddy didn't bring

in a team, against orders, to pull

my ass out.  Buddy named... Wesker.

CHRIS

You've been with this asshole since... ?

BARRY

Since before that.  We were... kids

together.  Macon, Georgia.  He's...

only an asshole some of the time...

VICKERS

Who knows what we'll find down there?

AIKEN

Think positive.  The farther down we

go, the worse it's gonna get.  So...

until we hit bottom, we're in good

shape... relatively speaking.

SPEYER

What the fuck?

VICKERS

Whatever it is.. .it can't get us.

We're in the ceiling!

AIKEN

Maybe it's like... really tall.

SULLIVAN

Aiken...

WESKER

Main-frame. Might have some data

we could use. (A quick decision)

Fox, Marini, Vickers.  Down.

CHRIS

The man has balls, I'll say that.

WESKER

Hustle it, Vickers.  You're the guy

we need.  To cut into the network.

WESKER

Watch these entrances, guys.

VICKERS

AAAAH ! Shit.

VICKERS (cont. )

I'm alright. I'm alright.

WESKER

Hold tight. It doesn't sound like

it's on this level.

VICKERS

(At the computer) Shit. I'm locked

out. Any clues for a password?

WESKER

Try... Umbrella.

VICKERS

Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.

No data. Just some kind of video

feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.

It's a play-back. (Watching the

screen) Holy shit!

WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Please...please.. .if anyone is

receiving this...

WOMAN (cont.)

the situation is completely.

out of control. We...

FOX

Maybe the ceiling's not such a

safe place, after all.

WESKER

Scram! SCRAM!

BARRY

Haul ass, boss!

WESKER

That's...two I owe ya.

BARRY

One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .

WESKER

Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...

is not in my vocabulary.

WESKER (cont.)

Let's move.

CHRIS

Those things could get up here.

We can't let that happen. This

is our way out...

CHRIS

(Reading) Caruso.

CHRIS (cont.)

Can you hear me?

CHRIS (cont.)

Caruso! Can you hear me?

CHRIS

Thank you.

JILL

Any time. How do we get back UP?

CHRIS

Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you

shouldn't have jumped down here.

JILL

We have a real problem here, Chris.

CHRIS

How big is this place? How many

people were down here? How...

JILL

HOW DO WE GET UP?

CHRIS

(Straining) Big. Heavy.

JILL

It got you!

BARRY

No skin broken. I'm alright.

CHRIS

We owe you a pair of pants.

WESKER

Stand down. Five minutes.

SPEYER

I'm through, Wesker.

MARINI

Me too, man. This ain't nothin'

I signed on for.

WESKER

(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.

MARINI

Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!

WESKER

You can't. (He flashes his access

card.) Not without this.

SPEYER

Fuck you! And your fancy doors and

your green key! The choppers have

rockets. They can blow out a wall

if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.

WESKER

You wanna see a wall blow, I'll

blow all of 'em for ya.

WESKER (cont.)

I'll put a crater in this forest that

takes out Racoon City and everything

else for twenty miles... with this.

WESKER (cont.)

It's a radio detonator...to set off

explosives that are...buried under

neath us somewhere. The ultimate

containment measure. Incinerate the

place. (Smiling again) It has a...

dead-man mechanism... .(he taps the

ear-piece) ...that reads my pulse.

My heart stops, and... boom.

CHRIS

You...lunatic! That damn thing can

slip out of your ear by accident!

WESKER

That's right. It's your job...all

of your jobs...to see that it doesn't.

And to see that my heart... doesn't

skip any beats.

WESKER (cont.)

Give me the radio, soldier.

WESKER (cont.)

GIMME THE FUCKIN' RADIO, OR WE

ALL GO UP!

SULLIVAN

Sumbitch might do it, Speyer.

WESKER

I'II be obliged to do it! If I don't

get that antidote, I'll have to burn

this place out! (Beat) Valentine.

The radio.

CHRIS

(To Jill) What are you, this guy's

flunky? He just threatened to blow

us all up, for Christ's sake!

JILL

That's what I'm trying to prevent!

LAGUARDIA

How many digits did you receive?

RADIO MAN

Six. The beginning of an air-

support code, but... it just went

dead on me.

LAGUARDIA

Call S.T.A.R.S. in Washington.

I want...

RADIO MAN

Hold it...

RADIO MAN (cont.)

It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir.

We got the signal sir. (He clicks

off) He says it was... a mistake.

LAGUARDIA

Call Washington anyway. I want

the authority to take action if

necessary.

MAN WITH RING (o.s.)

Holden.

HOLDEN (Man with ring, cont.)

Denied. This is Wesker's show.

If he was in real trouble, we'd

have lost half of Pennsylvania

by now.

HOLDEN (cont.)

No authorization.

RADIO MAN

No independent action.

LAGUARDIA

Damn. I feel so fuckin'... helpless!

WESKER

You guys were hand-picked. A Special

Unit. Most of you have been sitting

on your asses, drawing pay checks for

more than two years. Well... it's time

to repay those... Government loans.

SPEYER

Bull shit. I'm not...

WESKER

Pitch your empties. Put all your

loaded clips on that crate there.

I want a count. Then I want the

rounds divvied up... evenly.

WESKER (cont.)

Alright. We're on.. .(checking the

maps) ...level "C"...

AIKEN

Lingerie. Notions.

WESKER

GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have

men dead upstairs! This hell-hole

is full of people who died... because

of this stinkin' ...BUG!

JILL

Forty two.

SPEYER

That's all we have?

WESKER

We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.

(To Jill) I'll take three. Three

to your boyfriend...

CHRIS

Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.

WESKER

Good. Then... we all get four clips.

SPEYER

They must have... weapons down here,

somewhere. A powder magazine.

WESKER

No more side trips. It was a mistake

to go into that lab upstairs. My

mistake. And I'm not makin' another

one. From now on it's straight ahead.

In and out.

WESKER (cont.)

Not an override. My key won't work

here on the way out. Prop the door.

CHRIS

Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.

JILL

He's just... trying to get the job

done. Doing what he has to do.

CHRIS

Yeah, well...I hope you'll say

the same about me... when I do...

what I have to do.

WESKER

(Checking his map) It's not clear...

which way to go.

RODRIGUEZ

Want me to flip a coin?

SULLIVAN

What's that sound like to you?

AlKEN

A meat-eater.

CHRIS

(Softly to Jill) This is the heart

of the whole place. They've got to

have it... protected somehow.

CHRIS (cont.)

DUCK! HIT THE DECK!

CHRIS (cont.)

FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!

SULLIVAN

There's no way outta this mousetrap!

RODRIGUEZ

So we live here now?

SPEYER

We gotta run for it.

AIKEN

Bad idea, Speyer.

CHRIS

Down. Through these.

VICKERS

Where do they go?

SULLIVAN

Does it matter?

JILL

On three...

CHRIS

One... two...

JILL

God...and it doesn't even stop them...

CHRIS

It's not meant to stop them. It's

meant to stop...something else.

SPEYER

We damn near got turned into Rice

Krispies by that gizmo of yours.

If you don't want me to nail that

fuckin' thing into your ear, you

deactivate it. Right now.

WESKER

I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you

can't chicken out. The system can

only be turned off at the main panel.

BARRY

Where the hell is that?

WESKER

Where the explosives are. Down...

farther than we need to go. We only

have to make it down one more level.

If... when... we make it back up to

the choppers... we can fly out of

the detonator's signal range.

CHRIS

I'm not willing to rely on that.

I live here, this is my town!

WESKER

The town's been evacuated. Just...

just in case.

CHRIS

That explains the lie. About the

plane crash. An airplane down...

with weapons on board... would nicely

explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?

You figured all along you might have

to blow this place!

WESKER

I don't want to do it. I... I hope

I don't have to.

WESKER (cont.)

That's the best I can do for you,

kid. Good faith. Now... let's

knock on it.

CHRIS

I...I can't let this happen. I've

got to find that bomb.

JILL

I'll help. Once Wesker gets what

he wants, my obligation is over.

CHRIS

No. I want you out. With the

rest of them. Wesker won't push

the button until you're clear.

JILL

He doesn't want to push the button.

CHRIS

He has to. Don't you see? He can't

leave these labs here. And, Jesus...

walking corpses! He's gotta get rid

of the evidence.

JILL

Chris, no!

CHRIS

I've got to try and stop this.

RODRIGUEZ

Shit. One thing after another.

WESKER

Sit tight. Ride it out.

JILL

CHRIS!

WESKER

This way. (He starts off.)

JILL

No. That way.  Chris and the others...

WESKER

If they're dead, they're dead. If

they're alive, they'll still be alive

in twenty minutes. When we get back.

JILL

Maybe not. And how do we know it's

only going to be twenty minutes?

How do we know we'll be able to come

back this way?

WESKER

We don't. But we'll do our damndest

to try. This is it, guys. The home

stretch. Let's go.

WESKER (cont.)

(Looking back) Valentine. You're

on the clock! Fall in!

REBECCA

Th-this thing was no accident.

It was cultivated!

CHRIS

And it didn't rip out the ceiling

for the fun of it. Stay alert.

CHRIS (cont.)

Here.

AIKEN

My mother made me eat vegetables.

I know 'em all. This ain't one

of 'em.

SULLIVAN

Aiken...

AIKEN

Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!

CHRIS

Get out of the away!

CHRIS (cont.)

Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!

AIKEN

They.. .they killed Sullivan. The

bastards... whoever did this shit...

they KILLED SULLIVAN!

CHRIS

(To Rebecca) Hold this.

CHRIS (cont.)

GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!

AIKEN

K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd

be.. .better off dead. That...ain't

never been truer than now. Kill me!

VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)

We're close. I think I'll be able

to get the package. It's been...

very interesting.

VOICE IN THE ROOM

Anything you can't handle?

VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)

(Chuckling) There's nothing I

can't handle.

HOLDEN

Keep us appraised.

HOLDEN (cont.)

(To the others in the room) I'm

reassured, gentlemen...that every-

thing is...under control.

WESKER

Where are the others?

JILL

Right behind me. Were you...

talking to someone?

WESKER

To Washington. To my... superiors.

They're your superiors too, Valentine.

Don't forget that.

BARRY

Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.

We hit a dead end.

SPEYER

Us too. Cement wall.

VICKERS

We're never gonna get to that lab.

REBECCA

(Crying quietly) I... can't take

this any more.

CHRIS

We take what comes. That's the

secret of our genius.

CHRIS (cont.)

How old are you?

REBECCA

Not very old at all. Not nearly

old enough to...to...

CHRIS

None of us is old enough for that.

REBECCA

Jill... told me... you were nice .

CHRIS

She did? She never told me.

CHRIS

Hurry.

BARRY

Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!

WESKER

That was the idea.

BARRY

What idea?

WESKER

To win. The idea was... to win.

VOICE (o.s.)

Now that... is a metal-head.

CHRIS (cont.)

What d'ya think? Should I wait

for orders, or just wing it?

JILL

Wing it!

CHRIS

You know...that just might be

the ticket. Wing the fuckers.

CHRIS (cont.)

Forget the head shots. They're

useless. Shoot for the joints.

The JOINTS!

SPEYER

Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!

BARRY

Where? As far as we'll get, either

way, is a cement wall.

ADA

You lost a man. If I had only

been faster. I was unfamiliar

with the mechanism.

ADA (cont.)

God. One of them... is still ..

Quickly. Inside. Quickly!

ADA

Don't worry, it's mindless. It

doesn't realize that it's strong

enough to push the door open.

BARRY (cont.)

Sometimes the dumb get lucky.

RODRIGUEZ

Hasn't happened to me, yet.

ADA

My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.

As far as we know, we are the...only

ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"

level. One of the biologists saved us.

Brought us down here. He knew that...

he didn't have long to live. He...

started the mechanism... out there,

in the corridor.. .and he let it...

take him.

ADA (cont.)

I only saw it used that one time.

Or perhaps...I could have been

faster. The man...you lost...

RODRIGUEZ

You did fine, lady. We're obliged.

ADA

As are we. (Sighing) We believed...

we would die here. Believed...the

bomb would destroy us.

JILL

You knew.. .about the bomb?

ADA

The end for a place like this, when

it fails... must be a bomb, yes?

ADA (cont.)

But now... that you are here... the

bomb will not come.

CHRIS

It... already came. ma'am. We

brought it. The colonel, here...

he's wearing it.

ADA

(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you

here to... rescue? Or destroy?

WESKER

Both. (With that odd smile of his)

If I have to pick only one... I'll

pick destroy.

ADA

You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.

WESKER

Once again. Both. (Still smiling)

Two salaries. Three if you count

combat pay.

ADA

The man I loved, John Marcus...

developed the organism that caused

all this. He... he did it for

humanitarian purposes. It was

taken away from him...for in-human

purposes...by men like you!

WESKER

No, ma'am. Men like me... are just

errand boys. Sent in to do the

wet-work. All of the glory. None

of the benefits.

ADA

After what you've seen down here,

do you think any of it could be

turned into... benefit?

WESKER

Yes. I think it could be turned

into five or ten million dollars.

How do we get into "D" lab?

ADA

Death lab. (She slumps) John

was killed...never even knowing it

existed. They kept him... isolated,

upstairs, while a separate team was

down here...corrupting his research.

Using it to build B.O.W.s.

CHRIS

B.O.W.s?

ADA

Bio-organic weapons.

REBECCA

The sharks. The plant.

ADA

Early experiments.

CHRIS

The snake.

ADA

A failure. Its behavior remained

reptilian. All they could ever get

it to do was... grow in size.

RODRIGUEZ

Those dogs. They were weapons.

ADA

No. They... simply became infected.

As did... everyone else. Janitors.

The cook. Electricians. Guards.

People who believed they were serving

their flag. Scientists. Great minds...

turned into mindless.. .ghouls!

CHRIS

Before the outbreak, the experiments

went further, didn't they? Those...

ceiling-crawlers out there.. .

ADA

The product of human DNA spliced

with the DNA of vicious carnivores...

animals, even insects. Plated with

armor, beneath newly cultivated skin.

Then... injected with poison, so their

biological components would die.

JILL

Die.

ADA

The "T"-virus reactivates them in a

matter of minutes, but... in battle,

lost minutes are... inconvenient. So,

the B.O.W.s had to die... and be allowed

to revive before they could be used to...

full advantage. They were murdered...

by their own people... so they could

never be murdered again... by the enemy.

CHRIS

Were any more of these...weapons...

developed?

WESKER

HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?

ADA

You don't.

ADA (cont.)

It can't be opened. Thank God.

None of us is cleared for that

level of security.

WESKER

How fortunate... that I am.

WESKER (cont.)

Barry. Come with me. The rest of

you.. .make sure this door doesn't

close. Remember...

ADA

Have...you been leaving doors open?

JILL

Yes.

ADA

This place is going to be overrun by...

REBECCA

Brad's in really bad shape.

REBECCA (cont.)

That's not just a scrape. You

were bitten, weren't you?

VICKERS

One...of the sharks. Its teeth.

I Just...brushed up against its

teeth...after it was dead.

ADA

(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,

shoot him!

JILL

No! We're so close. The antidote.

BARRY

What's got into you man? This...

this isn't like you.

WESKER

Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.

WESKER (cont.)

This is...what I've been all my life.

A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.

Wipin' the shit off their asses...

all the while lookin' for a break.

A way to get some of my own! Well

this it, friend. I'm myself,

alright. And I know exactly what

I'm doing. I told you...before this

day was over... I'd pay you back.

RODRIGUEZ

(Looking at the gun) You know

how to use that thing, chica?

ADA

Of course I do. I'm a scientist.

REBECCA

No! You can't! Not while there's

still a chance to save him!

WESKER

(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.

Nobody knows it exists. Except us...

and Holden.

BARRY

Holden?

WESKER

Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.

He signs the checks. (Excited) We've

got it, Barry! Our fortune!

BARRY

You're not gonna try to get this

big mother outta here ?

WESKER

Don't have to. All we need is the

data. Then.. .these things can be

cranked out on an assembly line!

WESKER (cont.)

YES! This is it!

BARRY

What about the antidote?

WESKER

Antidote? (Laughing) There is no

antidote. That was just happy horse

shit, to keep the team going.

BARRY

You're gonna give this to Umbrella?

WESKER

No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then

I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...

right next to yours.

JILL (o.s.)

God...damn!

JILL (cont.)

That thing... can't be real!

WESKER

It's real, alright. And it's worth...

more than gold. More than uranium!

RODRIGUEZ

Do we get a piece of that action?

WESKER

All of you do. Anyone who comes out

of this alive... gets a taste.

RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)

I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my

life. I'm happy to eat some more...

as long as it's got some gravy on it.

WESKER

Anybody else see it my way?

ADA

(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!

TOSHIRO

I...I want to live.

WESKER

Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?

CHRIS

And I was gonna try to disarm the

bomb. This place should be destroyed!

It needs to be destroyed!

WESKER

Gotcha, son. It's only because

of Valentine, here, that I didn't

squeeze the trigger.

CHRIS

If she's on your side... she doesn't

mean shit to me. And I don't mean

shit to her.

JILL

Chris, please. There's only... one

way to go, here .

WESKER

That's right. My way!

JILL

Yes, sir. Your way!

JILL (cont.)

I...can't yell you, Chris...how much

I wanted...things to have turned out

differently. (Beat) Goodbye.

JILL (cont.)

Shit. I got all my courage up...

and we still have fifteen minutes!

BARRY

You shoot. I shoot, boss.

BARRY (cont.)

Shit.. here I am still callin'

you 'boss'.

JILL

We believed in you. I believed

in you. Boy, was I a sucker.

ADA

Get out! Now! Or you never will!

RODRIGUEZ

So... we'll live here! (Glancing at

the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks

like a sonuvabitch.

ADA

I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!

JILL

Everybody! OUT!

CHRIS

(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.

BARRY

Go.

BARRY (cont.)

You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.

Not just now, boss.

BARRY (cont.)

This thing gets loose, it's gonna

be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it

back. Give you guys a fair chance.

JILL

LOOK OUT!

WESKER

Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so

help me God, you're a dead man.

CHRIS

Get going.

JILL

Not without...

CHRIS

MOVE!

WESKER

COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!

THAT'S AN ORDER !

CHRIS

Orders don't mean shit any more,

Wesker. Especially when they come

from sell-out bastards like you.

WESKER

B-buddy. You gotta get us out.

BARRY

Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?

Is there some other...'need-to-know'

secret for shutting down the Big

Bopper, here?

WESKER

No. It.. it can't be shut down.

BARRY

The ultimate warrior. The ultimate

soldier. We'll see. How it does

against a couple of hard-ass career

guys, like you and me.

ADA

The corridor outside... can be moved.

ADA

You won't come out in the same place.

But you'll find a freight loader that

can be accessed with...

JILL

...a blue key. I hope.

ADA

No. Pot blue or green. Red.

ADA (cont.)

I took it from an Umbrella agent

assigned to us here. He died...

like all the rest.

CHRIS

Red... overrides green.

ADA

Yes.

CHRIS

So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.

ADA

I was hoping it would never be un-

locked again. Go. I will see that

this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ...

is destroyed.

CHRIS

It's destroyed. It's worthless

But you're not.

ADA

I helped develop it!

CHRIS

Unwittingly. They lied to you.

They lied to Marcus. They made

you believe you were doing a good

thing when it wasn't good at all.

It was evil!

CHRIS (cont.)

The kind of evil that... resides

in all of us. Makes us... greedy,

uncaring. The kind of evil that

will... wipe us out, in the end.

Unless we stand up against it.

ADA

Stand up? Against powers that have...

ruled the world since before we were

born? We will only be...eliminated.

Or locked away someplace else. I'd

rather die here. Knowing that the

virus has died with me .

JILL

What if it's already spread? You're

the only one...who knew anything

about it.

ADA

(The thought penetrating) But, I...

know so little.

CHRIS

More than anyone else. You have...

a responsibility.

JILL

To a higher command. The highest.

BARRY

That's one helluva big pump.

WESKER

An implant.

BARRY

From what? A fuckin' elephant?

WESKER

Rhinoceros.

BARRY

Shit. I figured you knew more than

you were telling.

BARRY (cont.)

How do we kill this thing?

WESKER

I told you, we don't. W-we can't.

It's unstoppable!

ADA

I don't know if I can face this.

CHRIS

Just get us upstairs. I'll take

care of it from there.

ADA

Alright. (With a sigh) Come.

ADA

Doors... were left open.

ADA

Step on.

JILL

I don't know if it's gonna happen.

RODRIGUEZ

Come on. I been waitin' all day

for somthin. like this.

CHRIS

(To Rosie) You're up.

RODRIGUEZ

I'm havin' too much fun. You got

a lady. I just got me. Anyway...

I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.

I'll make it. Get outta here.

ADA

(Calling up to her) Level "C".

Have your weapons ready.

RODRIGUEZ

(From below) Whoop-de-doo.

BARRY

Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna

feed this thing a pineapple.

WESKER

NO! It might damage the system!

I've got to get this data!

BARRY

Forget it. Bullets don't work!

WESKER

They seem to work just fine.

WESKER (cont.)

That's it. Take a little lunch

break, Mr. "T". I just need a few

more seconds.

WESKER (cont.)

(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .

WESKER (cont.)

EAT SHIT, YOU...

ADA

Level "B".

REBECCA

Don't see anything.

ADA

Good.

ADA

We're almost there. You'll have

to jump off. The belt won't stop.

REBECCA

Bats! There are bats in here!

ADA

No. They're crows! Infected!

Don't let them bite you!

RODRIGUEZ

Rats. FLYING RATS!

RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !

CHRIS

(From above) You alright?

RODRIGUEZ

Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.

REBECCA

I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.

ADA

Climb out. OUT!

CHRIS

ROSIE!?

RODRIGUEZ

I'M ALRIGHT!

RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

Here! Here, you... lizard. You

fuckin' cockroach, HERE!

RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

(Calling up) BAD NEWS, GUYS. THIS

THING'S NOT SO STUPID!

CHRIS

(From above) Climb, Rosie!

ROSIE

No. I'm finished. I live here now.

CHRIS

ROSIE, NOOOOO!

ROSIE

EAT ME, YOU PILE OF SHIT!

ADA

Come.

CHRIS

ROSIE ...

ADA

COME! You convinced me that there

were...larger matters. We're at the

top. You said you'd get us out.

CHRIS

Th-this way.

REBECCA

Hell of a shit-house.

JILL

The guy was a bootlegger... with

a sense of humor.

CHRIS

I hope they haven't disabled this.

CHRIS (cont.)

Alright. We made it.

LAGUARDIA

I'm goin' in.

RADIO MAN

You don't have authority.

LAGUARDIA

Fuck authority.

CHRIS

Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!

RADIO

What in God's name is that thing!

LAGUARDIA

Somethin' we weren't supposed to

see. Drop the ladder. And drop

the Stinger.

CHRIS

GET UP!

RADIO MAN

Catch this!

JILL

Toss it to me!

JILL (cont.)

CHRIS!

JILL

(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We

have to get out of range.

CHRIS

No. (To the pilot) Circle around.

LAGUARDIA

Are there more survivors?

CHRIS

No. Just...circle, okay? I want

to...take a last look.

JILL

It's... your home.

CHRIS

I hoped... it would be our home.

JILL

I guess... we're gonna be moving.

CHRIS

(To the pilot) Full throttle.

Out of here, man!
