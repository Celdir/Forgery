OPEN ON:

BEN

(into cell)

God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!

I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right

Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got

a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and

I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that

in all your squandering the best you can do for me is

A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!

It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you

offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've

worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and

you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should

fire you and go to ICM.

CATHY(O.S.)

(off phone)

Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad

mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as

famous as you are today. The least you can do is

show me a little god damn respect.

BEN

(into phone)

You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.

FUCK YOU! You're fired.

(Ben hangs up)

Unfucking believable.

BEN

Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro.

Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:

JASON DOES BROADWAY?

BEN

(into phone)

What's up, B.D. with the B.D.

WOMAN'S VOICE

(off phone)

Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.

BEN

Christine?

CHRISTINE(O.S.)

No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.

Of course it's me, silly.

And I feel like an ass standing

in this theater lobby all by myself.

Where are you babe, the movie starts

in twenty minutes.

BEN

Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think

there was some big accident. It could be

a little while so I don't want you to start

freaking if I don't get there at exactly,

(checks watch)

Eight thirty.

CHRISTINE(O.S.)

All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally

p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

BEN

(putting up faux-enthusiasm)

Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.

I bet you did such a great job.

CHRISTINE(O.S.)

I did. Hon, although I got a total of

six minutes screen time, they're the

best six minutes of the movie.

BEN

Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.

Look, my battery's dying . . .

CHRISTINE(O.S.)

Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

BEN

Sure thing.

BEN

(startled)

Jesus.

(answers call)

Hello?

VOICE

Hello.

BEN

Who is this?

VOICE

Who is this?

At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish

deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two

films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.

BEN

Well what number are you trying to reach?

VOICE

I don't know.

BEN

I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

VOICE

Do I?

BEN

(peeved)

Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.

Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

VOICE

Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

BEN

(angrily)

Asshole, Can't talk.

VOICE

But your voice sounds so familiar.

BEN

Does it now?

VOICE

BEN

(smiling profusely)

Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

VOICE

Really? You're such a talented actor.

BEN

(loves the praise)

Thanks.

VOICE

Now let's see you act your way out of this one.

BEN

What do you mean?

VOICE

I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES

ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend

Christine is in there.  She's all alone.

Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film

to start.

(laughs coldly)

I've got my knife.

BEN

(turning pale)

Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

VOICE

More of a game really.

BEN

What kind of a game?

VOICE

You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.

Here's how we play. I ask you a question.

You get it right, your girlfriend lives.

You answer wrong, she dies.

BEN

I swear to God if you lay a finger on her

I'll fucking kill you!

VOICE

Maybe so, but right now, we play the game.

First question, Your girlfriend's counting on

you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

VOICE

Come on. Don't you know?

BEN

(hesitating)

It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character

she plays in the movie!

VOICE

Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.

BEN

What?! But I did everything you said to do!

VOICE

That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're

taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me

beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes.

I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

BEN

What?!

VOICE

Good bye Ben.

RECORDED MESSAGE

You're not playing by the rules Ben.

Don't you want her to live?

BEN

I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

VOICE

No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want

you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.

Do you understand?

CUT TO:

BEN

(to himself)

Thank God I decided to do some community service.

BEN

(into phone)

Yeah.

VOICE

Very good. You follow directions well.

Now for the final part of the game.

Put down the bat and approach the sign,

slowly.

BEN

(into phone)

Where are you?

VOICE

Closer than you think.

BEN

(into phone)

Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want

from me?

VOICE

To see your reaction.

BEN

Reaction to what?

BEN

OHMYGOD! NO!

CHRISTINE --

BEN

You just lost the role Ben.

Consider this your parting gift.

TITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"

OPEN ON:

EXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

GALE

Good morning Hollywood. And today

officially starts the Summer movie

season. Opening the box office this

week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins

in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy

and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,

and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer

in STAB 2, based off my best selling

book the WINDSOR MURDERS.

GALE

Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed

to the occasion. Today we have director of the

upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman

Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice

welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.

ROMAN

Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

GALE

It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

ROMAN

(addressing audience)

Well it's a honor to be here amongst so

many fans of the genre. And I must say

that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,

or Tori or David not returning to complete

the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is

here. Aided with my excellent cast of

newcomers I believe we're going to pull

off one of the best Stabs yet.

GALE

Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly

seems that way.

(a beat)

Honestly though,

(smiles)

tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

ROMAN

(a long pause)

Honestly, my life.

GALE

Your life?

ROMAN

Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with

those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like

I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick

your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to

a Tobe Hooper flick.

GALE

Would you excuse me for a moment?

ROMAN

(smiling)

Sure.

GALE

Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to

introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.

(flashes badge)

Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon,

or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

GALE

Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.

He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the

second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part

in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Both of them were found brutally murdered this

morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy

reports having come back to me yet but the

bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

GALE

So is that why you're here? Is that why you're

holding me from my show, to tell me about some

brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but

there's more. The killer left a note.

GALE

A note?

GALE(O.S.)

That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)

There's more.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,

but she's keeping herself very well hidden.

You're my one and only hope in finding her.

Her life may be in grave danger.

GALE

I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being

sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but

I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor

she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other

person that might know is,

(gale hesitates),

not going to talk.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

And who would that be?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TOM

Hey Dew, did you hear?

DEWEY

No, what?

TOM

Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

DEWEY

That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're

making movies in the hills, the next day

you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

SARAH

Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with

these re-writes. It's like every five

minutes there's a new script. God, and

you just know this all because of STAB 2's

script winding up on the internet two months

after it wrapped shooting.

TYSON

And still the film is Number One at the box

office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty

and Arlington Street.

ANGELINA

I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

TYSON

Nah I think it's doing so damn well because

one of it's players got iced. I just hope

none of us end up dead.

ANGELINA

Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.

God Ben Damon was such a hottie.

TYSON

(sighs)

And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either

but I'm really concerned about my safety

now.

SARAH

What are you talking about?

The murders were a completely isolated

incident.

TYSON

(reading from script)

SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.

"What are you talking about Ricky, the

murders were a completely isolated incident".

SARAH

Would you give that script a rest?

It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

TYSON

I'm just saying, though. What if there's

someone out there stalking actors? Huh?

Then what?

ANGELINA

There's always someone out there stalking

actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

TYSON

Melinda McGraw?

ANGELINA

No, the other one. The one who played his

wife.

SARAH

I know who you're talking about. Rebecca

something.

ANGELINA

Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.

Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one

too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,

Jody Foster, --

TYSON

Listen Miss ingenue, your cheering me up to much,

Give it a break.

TOM

What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart

I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.

Jeez.

(lights up a smoke)

So what are you doing tonight?

TOM

Talk about moody.

TOM

And how about you good looking?

Got any plans for later?

SARAH

Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex

with that doesn't look like you.

TYSON

Oh no. I ain't into that shit.

CUT TO:

GALE

Dejr vu-do.

VOICE(O.S.)

Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers

comes running. What a shock.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.

I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's

Events?

DEWEY

Yeah. A real tragedy.

GALE

Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside,

this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

DEWEY

What so you can just exploit her again with another

book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

GALE

(to Kincaid)

Show him.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of

Ben and his girlfriend.

DEWEY

I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.

I promised her nobody would ever find her.

If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to

approach her with this on my own and see

what she'd like to do about it.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else

should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

DEWEY

Understood.

(a beat)

If you'll excuse me Detective.

(coldly)

Gale.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I'm going to have a little chat with the

producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.

WOMAN(O.S.)

GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!

Gale

Shit.

Jennifer

Listen, I know we've never met, and

I don't mind you never returning my calls,

but I have to tell you that after two films

I feel like I am in your mind.

Gale

Well, that would explain my constant headaches.

Jennifer

(defensively)

You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out

on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment'

that's a pretty good fall back.

Gale

Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out

with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty

good fall back.

Jennifer

Gives me more time for my work.

After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex

character.

Gale

And to be played by an actress with such

depth and range.

Dewey

No answer at Sid's. Where'd

the Detective go?

JENNIFER

(excitedly)

DEWEY!

Jennifer

(fondles Dewey's butt)

Gale, I think you'll really appreciate

my character work in this one, someone's

helped me understand the real you.

Gale

Someone?

Jennifer

The ruthless ambition, your private

self-loathing, and that lost and lonely

little girl inside.

Gale

Lost and lonely what?

Jennifer

You heard me.

(takes Dewey's cellular)

Thanks Dewey.  I'll return it.

Gale

Lost and lonely what?

Dewey

Little girl inside.

Gale

I thought you were supposed to be in

Woodsboro!

Dewey

Well, I'm surprised you thought about me

at all.  Listen I gotta get back to

trying to get hold of Sid.

Besides, she's more important than you ever were.

Gale

Wait! Dewey we can work on this together!

As a team! Like in the past!

Dewey

No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this

time I'd like to catch the killer before

the body count gets any higher.

(a beat)

Toodles.

MILTON

I can assure you that security on the set

will be at an all time high. Again, the

deaths are sheer tragedy.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.

(laughs)

I myself am a big STAB fan.

BUDDY

Really?

(smiles)

Have you ever thought about acting?

You've got just the right face.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I am kind of dedicated to my job.

Although I do enjoy taking acting

classes on my weekends. I grew up

around these studios anyway. I know

my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter

for PARAMOUNT.

MILTON

Really, what was his name?

GALE

Excuse me Detective, I think we have some

business to attend to.

MILTON

(flabbergasted)

GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here?

No press on the set!

(to security)

No press, no press on set!

Get that woman out of here.

SECURITY GAURD

(approaching)

Yes, Mr. Milton.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.

MILTON

Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

GALE

Oh come on! Why the hostility?

MILTON

Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and

all but last month I happened to catch

your little segment on me and how my wife

left me because I'm a sex addict who

enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls.

It was a real eye opener my lawyers are

still thinking about bringing to your

superior's attentions.

GALE

(shit-eating smile on her face)

They're the ones who approved it.

GALE

Alright Kincaid, no where to?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I go to the police station and do my job,

and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

GALE

Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem,

give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

GALE

Shit. Can I even get a ride home?

SIDNEY

WOMAN(O.S.)

Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone!

OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!

SIDNEY

Well then the people you need to call are the police.

WOMAN(O.S.)

No I need to call you. Just you.

SIDNEY

I'm sorry, your voice.

WOMAN(O.S.)

Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?

SIDNEY

REPORTER

The mutilated bodies were discovered late

last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor

Ben Damon was slated for a role in the

upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO --

VOICE

Do you think it's over Sidney?

Do you?

SIDNEY

W-what do you want?

VOICE

I want to finish what I started.

I want to finish the game.

SIDNEY

You sick fuck I'm tracing this call

as we speak! The police are gonna nail

your ass!

VOICE

(laughs coldly)

Let them try. You'll never find me.

I've already gotten away with murder before.

For instance, Maureen Prescott.

SIDNEY

(tears welling)

No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis

and Stu Macher did.

VOICE

Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think.

It's all been building up to this Sid.

Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of

blood that's been spilled has all been

leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.

SIDNEY

The final act? Well let's play asshole!

VOICE

No. We play in my court this time.

Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting

corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set

on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.

SIDNEY

If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you

real soon Sidney. Real soon.

TYSON

Roman and everybody else went home for

SARAH

Make-up. You need it.

Hey, Roman isn't here?

TYSON

No.

SARAH

Damn. He called my roommate and told her

he had some important things he wanted to

go over with me in his office tonight.

STAN

Yeah I bet.

SARAH

For the honorary field of directing and

cinematography in music videos.

How to the point.

SARAH

Oh shit.

Hello? Director's office.

ROMAN

Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running

late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10

minutes away.

SARAH

Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at

your   music video awards.

ROMAN

All right, since I got you on the phone,

let's talk about your character.

SARAH

What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who

gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!

ROMAN

You're not happy with your part.

SARAH

I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old.

I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm

not happy that my character is too stupid not to

have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been

cut into McNuggets.

ROMAN

Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the

lines.

SARAH

Huh, fine.

ROMAN

Page 22, Candy's big moment.

This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some

clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have

to start the scene in the shower!  The whole

shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I

mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?

ROMAN

Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is

that like candy cane or candy apple?

SARAH

Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have

the wrong number.

ROMAN

But you know my favorite name?

SARAH

I'm hanging up right now.

ROMAN

It's Sarah.

SARAH

Roman that's not the line.

ROMAN

It is in my script.

SARAH

Has there been another goddamn rewrite?

How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our

lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?

ROMAN

It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

What?  What movie?

ROMAN

My movie.

It looks like we're going to

with Miss Prescott anyway.

GALE

Shit. Sarah Darling.

(a beat)

I interviewed her too.

God, it's happening again isn't it

Detective?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Yes well we have a suspect, so don't

get that worried.

GALE

Who?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I'm not at liberty to tell you that

Miss Weathers. You're no longer working

with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why

you're standing in here right now. By

all means I should have you thrown out.

GALE

But you won't. You're a good man detective.

We think alike. I know you need my help.

And I know you know I need your help.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

In my fifteen years as a homicide detective

I've never met a single soul as pushy and

brazen as you are Miss Weathers.

GALE

Please, call me Gale.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his

phone records. He's the last person to

speak to Sarah Darling before she died.

Or at least call her home.

GALE

Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified

information. Why don't you go investigate

the bad meat at the A.P.

This is police work, not Pulitzer material.

GALE

Hey, fuck off.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

(cocky)

Well then. Looks like I'll go dust for

finger prints with Barbara Walters.

GALE

So, what now?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke

with Sarah Darling before she died.

ROMAN

That's because I didn't.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.

ROMAN

What meeting?

DETECTIVE WALLACE

We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah

and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate

answered the phone, says it was you.

ROMAN

Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told

her to go   anywhere!

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.

ROMAN

Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did

not call   Sarah Darling!

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Sarah Darling said you did.

ROMAN

Someone is trying to ruin my movie.

Someone wants to kill   my movie!

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll

be something interesting to put on the

director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.

ROMAN

(dry laugh)

Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.

Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?

They're actually shelving my film because there's

been one ensie little murder. God, three people died

during the filming of The Exorcist.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I

strongly doubt the killer of them left messages

on the scene for the police to find.

DEWEY

They found another note?

GALE

Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one

about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or

not it looks like we're going to have to  go

back into our past.

DEWEY

You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid.

This has nothing to do with you Gale.

GALE

This has everything to do with me Dewey.

I was the one who brought the nation's

attention to this shit anyway. I'll be

damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass

on the buck again.

DEWEY

Do you really mean it this time Gale?

GALE

Yes. Look, let's get something straight

Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police

came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to

make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

DEWEY

Why would the police come to you?

GALE

Again, I am the author of the definitive book on

the Woodsboro murders.!

(a beat)

What about you?

DEWEY

What about me?

GALE

You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only

place that's real!'  But now you're here.

Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited

until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean,

it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is

like seven everywhere else.

DEWEY

So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a

month? L.A Forever?

GALE

It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I

could've been the next Diane Sawyer!

DEWEY

What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?

I liked her!

GALE

It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.

DEWEY

You used to say that was our strength.

GALE

Dewey, you're not just here because of

that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video

version of me, are you?

DEWEY

Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not

About you.

GALE

All of what Dewey?  You do know something,

don't you?

DEWEY

Off the record.

GALE

Always.

DEWEY

Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a

woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to

see the file on Sid, for research.

GALE

And?

DEWEY

The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.

A month later, the station gets broken into,

the file room ransacked.

GALE

Someone stole Sid's file?

DEWEY

I already removed it.  I think someone on the

film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only

reason I came here. To make do a little

private investigating of my own and make sure no

one here was planning anything.

GALE

(whips out cellular)

I'm sorry, this is too good!

DEWEY

What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?

GALE

Right. Sorry.

(a beat)

Do you think he did it?

(RE: ROMAN)

DEWEY

(his beeper goes off)

I've got my suspicions but still,

nothing  you say can ever make me take

my eyes off one person.

GALE

And who is that?

DEWEY

Jennifer needs me.

GALE

Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

DEWEY

I'm on duty.

DEWEY

(noticing Gale)

Stop following me.

GALE

I happen to work for the police god dammit!

DEWEY

You're not a detective.

GALE

Neither are you, Magnum P.I.

DEWEY

Gale, your engine's still running.

GALE

Fuck!

TOM

Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

GALE

Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.

That's a shocker.

TOM

Hey I really liked that piece you did on me

last month. The one where you said my car

accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,

and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my

insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

GALE

Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.

Stage the news to boost ratings.

TOM

Really, cause that stunt lost me the

lead role in Roman Polanski's latest

picture. Huh, what a coincide I was

picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,

not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get

my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,

because of your big mouth I'm here,

drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second

rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer

Jollie and yourself!

(a beat, subtle)

Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should

Have a look at your break line. That your

car over there?

GALE

I think we should go inside. I have to have

a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.

TOM

(laughs)

You mean what's left of us.

(tosses empty bottle aside)

Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.

Gotta refuel.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

GALE

Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now?

What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those

USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly

you suck at acting?

JENNIFER

God damn you Gale Weathers!

Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his

victims as they die in the script!

Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.

So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so

his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's

Candy, and now me!

GALE

Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!

Number one there were five different

versions of the script given out.

Ben Damon was given a fake script because

he was only being offered the role.

It only had fragments of real scenes from the

actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

GALE

(reading script)

AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!

This is complete bullshit.

Who wrote this piece of crap?

JENNIFER

I know right. It was kinda weak.

That's cause Will Kennison only wrote

a rough treatment of it.

The script was written by some new guy.

He wrote Arlington Street.

GALE

Still that was a much better movie,

I saw it at the premiere last week.

God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked

with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.

ANGELINA

(crying)

What are you talking about?

Because of this shit I'll probably never

act in a Hollywood film again.

TOM

Hey good looking, if you play your cards right,

I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch

and try you out for a few films my  production

company is working on.

(a beat)

How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?

TOM

I'll be right back.

TOM

(calling out)

Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you?

I was only playing! Hey look, I can really

get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?

(pauses)

Damn it. There goes my chances of getting

some head from her.

Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the

TOM

Aaaangelina?

CUT TO:

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS

TOM

Angelina?

Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet

THE GHOST --

TOM

You fucker!

The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The

TOM

(gagging)

Fucker!

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?

GALE

I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important

is that we stick together.

No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

DEWEY

What about Sidney?

JENNIFER

What about her?

DEWEY

Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.

I'll get it.

JENNIFER

What if it's the killer?

GALE

Oh use your brain drama queen!

Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door?

Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in

some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or

Chucky? Huh?

DEWEY

Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

GALE

Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

JENNIFER

Do you smell something?

DEWEY

(smirking)

It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

DEWEY

Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.

DEWEY

Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

GALE

Who's phone?

JENNIFER

Oh shit it's my cell!

DEWEY

Answer it!

JENNIFER

(into phone)

Hello?

VOICE

Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?

JENNIFER

It's him! It's the killer!

Gale rips the phone out of Jennifer's hands.

GALE

(into phone)

Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck

do you want?

JENNIFER

What's your favorite scary movie Gale?

GALE

I dunno but I can tell you that your's

will be the home video footage of me

sticking my foot up your ass! Now come

out and fight like a real man you pussy!

GHOST(O.S.)

I just might!

JENNIFER

God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!

He's dead!

GALE

No! He's not dead! He's still breathing!

Look!

DEWEY

Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out

of here.

DEWEY

OH. OH GOD. GALE --

GALE

What?

DEWEY

(screaming)

GALE BEHIND YOU!

JENNIFER

(screaming)

DIE MOTHER FUCKER!

DIE! DIE! DIE!

GALE

Come on!

DEWEY

OH SHIT! RUN!

CUT TO:

WE ARE:

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Whoever it is, now is taking credit

for Maureen Prescott's murder.

GALE

But we know who killed Maureen Prescott,

Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they

even told Sidney how they did it!

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in

your book that Sidney got it wrong before.

She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother,

and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a

third killer.  Sidney Might know something

DEWEY

I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.

And even if there was a third killer,

Sidney doesn't know about it.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,

she is a key element in this case.  I have a press

in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead

celebrities.

GALE

Four? There are five.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.

Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned

how to count.

DEWEY

What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Police are still searching through the debris.

Could be days before we find her . . . that is,

if she's even there.

GALE

OK, look.  We all know that this has something to

do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the

killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Actually, there was more this time.

This time, we found a picture too.

DEWEY/GALE

(together)

What?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Before you jump to conclusions, the man in

the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country

on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's

got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's

supposedly the biggest thing down under since

Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

DEWEY

What does this have to do with Sid?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her

own daughter?

DEWEY

Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he

was married to Maureen.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

(chiming in)

What's your problem?  Last night you were almost

charcoal.  You gonna help us or what?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?

DEWEY

Is that a threat, Detective?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

When it's a threat, you'll know it.

DEWEY

(a beat)

Is that a threat?

GALE

Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers

later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either

Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going

to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

SIDNEY'S ANSWERING MACHINE(O.S.)

(off phone)

Hi, you've reached the machine. Leave a message,

talk as long as you'd like.

DEWEY

Sid it's me, this is the sixth time I've called.

(Sid turns the corner, is ushered down the hall by a cop)

Please pick up, I wanna make sure you're Okay.

(Dewey notices Sidney approaching him)

Sid!

SIDNEY

DEWEY!

DEWEY

What are you doing here? I told you to

stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.

SIDNEY

Well it's not safe for me up there either.

The killer found me Dewey. He called me

last night.

DEWEY

What?

SIDNEY

I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up

here with the people I care about.

(a beat)

Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is

talking about? I found this place from a

FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.

DEWEY

Follow me.

DEWEY

Detective Kincaid?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

What Rielly?

DEWEY

There's someone here who wants to help.

GALE

Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.

SIDNEY

Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.

GALE

Thank you.

DEWEY

Sid, this is detective Kincaid.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

DEWEY

The killer called her.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

What?  When?

GALE

What'd he say?

SIDNEY

Oh, you know, the usual small talk,

"What's new, how ya been, how do you want

to die?"

DEWEY

Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've

gotten your number?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.

Did you call her from the set?

DEWEY

No.

GALE

Do you have her number stored in your memory?

(Dewey thinks)

Phone memory!

DEWEY

Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

GALE

Has anyone else every used your phone?

DEWEY

Just Jennifer.

(To Kincaid_)

And you.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each

murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo

of your mother.

SIDNEY

Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.

Why didn't you say something?

DEWEY

I was afraid they were bait, something to,

ya know,  trick you out of hiding.

SIDNEY

Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio

where all this shit's going down.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Are you sure?

SIDNEY

Absolutely.

DEWEY

Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3

Production offices. That's where Sarah

Darling was murdered last night.

SIDNEY

Mm, what a waste of Silicone.

(a beat)

What does my mother have to do with this

all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.

SIDNEY

Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!

What are you doing here?

GALE

Who's this.

DEWEY

Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.

SIDNEY

She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.

KAREN

(smiling)

That's me. First and Last.

SIDNEY

It's been a while? You still working

at Bradley's?

KAREN

Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video

down the street. It pays better.

Anyway, I'm here because I heard on the

news about the murders and well, I found

this while rooting through Randy's things.

CUT TO:

RANDY

Told you I'd make a movie someday, huh?

WE ARE:

SIDNEY

Oh MY god.

RANDY

Well, if you're watching this tape, it means

as I feared, I did not survive these killings

here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason

I am here is to help you, so that my death

will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will

help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.

If this killer does come back, and he's for real,

there are a few things that you gotta remember.

Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same

rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you

find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory,

and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel

rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing

with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding

chapter of a trilogy.

DEWEY

A trilogy?

RANDY

That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field,

but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned

with, because true trilogies are all about going back

to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't

true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed

something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So

if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some

super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be

super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him

won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta

cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him

up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can

die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final

chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the

time this thing is through.  Number three; the past

will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you

think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is

not at rest, any sins you think were committed in

the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER

FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off

by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us

anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you,

you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your

back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed,

and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules

say, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not

if you're watching this tape.

SIDNEY

Thanks Karen. You be careful.

KAREN

Don't worry Sid. I got tickets to see

Family Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior

motive for driving all the way down here.

GALE

I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys

later.

DEWEY

Do you want us to come with you?

GALE

I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping

around the set?

SIDNEY

I can see nothing's changed.

DEWEY

No.

JENNIFER

Geez.

GALE

What the hell are you doing?

JENNIFER

Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?

GALE

I am Gale Weathers!

JENNIFER

Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie,

no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants

to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you.

So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way,

if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and

since they really want to kill you, they won't

kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?

GALE

None.

JENNIFER

You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.

GALE

And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.

JENNIFER

That's funny.

GALE

Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.

JENNIFER

Need to get in that building?

GALE

(sarcastically)

No really?

JENNIFER

There a story in that building?

GALE

Possibly.

JENNIFER

(flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card)

Gale Weathers would find a way.

(she swipes and opens the door)

JENNIFER

Basements creep me out.

GALE

Really, you know you'd make a fascinating

interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.

JENNIFER

Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more

homes than I do.

GALE

(smiling)

Oh I wish I got that one on tape.

It'd put a smile on my face everytime

I'm down.

JENNIFER

(underbreath)

Bitch.

BIANCA

Can I help you?

GALE

I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro

and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman

for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

BIANCA

I don't watch TV and I hate books.

Whatta you need?

GALE

Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

BIANCA

Nope.

GALE

(groans)

Well can you tell me if the woman in this

picture looks familiar to you.

BIANCA

Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those

files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

GALE

Well if you won't work for me, will you work

for the president?

BIANCA

The president . . . of the studio.

JENNIFER

Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?

JENNIFER

Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy.

(to Gale)

My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story.

BIANCA

Follow me.

CUT TO:

BIANCA

(staring at picture, flipping through file cabinet)

I know every face in here, respect for the unknown

actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking

for Maureen Prescott --

GALE

(interrupting)

It may be Maureen Reynolds --

BIANCA

Well you'll find neither.

Rina Reynolds, however,

You will.

JENNIFER

(smiling)

Rina Reynolds. What a stage name.

BIANCA

You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.

GALE

What are these movies? 'Amazombies',

'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?

BIANCA

Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

GALE/JENNIFER

(together)

What?

BIANCA

You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer?

Those were some of his early flicks.

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.

DEWEY

Do you want me to come with you Sid?

I mean, remember what Randy said?

SIDNEY

No I'll be ok. I've got my mace.

My knife.

(smiles, raises up her fists)

These two lethal weapons.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Sure you don't need a police escort?

That's what we're here for.

SIDNEY

No really, I'll be fine.

SIDNEY

I'll be right back.

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

H-hello? Anyone there?

MAN(O.S.)

(whisper)

Sidney.

SIDNEY

(crying)

Shit.

DEWEY

(re:gun)

Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.

SIDNEY

(hysterical)

Jesus Christ Dewey help me!

They tried to kill me in the bathroom!

The killers!

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Wait a second? Killers? There's two

of them now? Aw shit!

DETECTIVE WALLACE

(into phone)

Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem   down

here on the Sunrise Studios lot.

No not another one. At least not yet.

Yeah we've had an attack.

(to Sid)

Do you need medical assistance?

(Sid nods her head 'no')

No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.

Wallace closes up his phone.

DEWEY

What?

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Well I got some good news in a way.

Roman Bridger didn't make those calls

To Sarah Darling. Police let him go.

Here's the bad news: The cellular was

cloned, it's untraceable. We now have

no suspects.

GALE(O.S.)

Dew!

GALE

Sidney, what happened?

DEWEY

Nevermind, what'd you two find?

GALE

We did some researching in the archives.

Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the

book on your mother's murder. For two years

of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically

disappeared off the face of the Earth.

SIDNEY

What are you talking about?

JENNIFER

We've found out where she went.

GALE

She was an actress Sidney. Minor

B-Movies. But now we have a new

suspect in this twisted fucking

web . . . John Milton.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

The head of the studio?

GALE

It makes sense doesn't it? It's his

big grandiose swan song from the genre.

What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?

JENNIFER

Sidney, what happened?

SIDNEY

I was attacked in the bathroom.

DEWEY

Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating

the bathroom?

DETECTIVE WALLACE

(looks at building)

I'm waiting for back-up.

I don't carry bullets in my

gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.

Dewey nods suspiciously.  Kincaid comes rushing into  frame.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?

I got a call on my cell from home.

They told me that someone was attacked.

DEWEY

And what made you think it was Sidney?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

(glaring)

Sid, get in my car. You're coming

back to the station with me where it's

safe.

GALE

Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay

John Milton a little visit.

DEWEY/JENNIFER

(together)

Agreed.

CUT TO:

MILTON

(into phone)

Roman I know you're upset. But there will

be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called

you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great

script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC

MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by

John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director.

What?

(knock at the door)

Come in.

(into phone)

No, not to you Roman.

Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.

DEWEY

So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.

MILTON

Just what the hell do you people think

you're doing, barging in here like this?

I've got important calls to make. I run

this studio.

GALE

Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?

MILTON

Who?

JENNIFER

Rina Reynolds.

MILTON

Do you know how many actors have worked

for me? Hundreds, thousands.

GALE

Nobody said she was an actor.

JENNIFER

Good twist.

MILTON

What's your point?

DEWEY

No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

MILTON

I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple

of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?

JENNIFER

Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story

of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and

you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!

GALE

Settle down Beavis.

(to Milton)

Why don't you tell us the truth?

MILTON

What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror

films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me

with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.

DEWEY

But you know who she was.

MILTON

When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd

known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.

I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?

GALE

And now? I mean, murders on your set and

still you say nothing?

MILTON

Get real, that would make me a suspect!

GALE

Just because you knew her?

MILTON

Yeah.

GALE

I don't think so!  Just what happened to

Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

MILTON

Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.

It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller

out behind the barn and shot him in the head a

long time ago.

GALE

Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug

up and drug all over National TV? Why don't

you start talking.

MILTON

It was in the 70's, everything was different.

I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.

It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get

them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing

happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or

another, no matter what she said afterwards.

GALE

Are you saying she was-

MILTON

I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they

did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth

is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges

were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds

wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in

Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.

SIDNEY

What do you know about trilogies?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

You mean like, movie trilogies?

SIDNEY

You seem to like movies, Detective.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep

calling you Sidney.

SIDNEY

I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer,

Detective.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one,

all bets are off.

SIDNEY

(noticing a huge file on her)

Did you request this case?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal

with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my

way around the studios.

SIDNEY

Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

To me Hollywood is about death.

SIDNEY

Excuse me?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you

see what I see day in and day out, the violence that

people do to each other, you get haunted.

I think you know about that.

SIDNEY

What do you mean?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't

Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head,

whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.

SIDNEY

Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop

being haunted is to be with people.  You're here,

you're not hiding, you've done the right thing,

Miss Prescott.

SIDNEY

Hmm.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

What did you know about your mother?

SIDNEY

I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect

family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a

secret life, and I tried to understand that, and

soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't'

know who my mom was.

(a beat)

Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my

mother for the first time. You know, with TV and

those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel

like I'm just learning about myself for the first

time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

DETECTIVE KINCAID

(a long beat)

Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage.

That's good news.

SIDNEY

How is that good news?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary,

flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle

guys like that.

SIDNEY

Oh yeah, how?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Catch him, or kill him.

SIDNEY

Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?

DETECTIVE KINCAID

(sotto)

My life.

SIDNEY

Mine too.

INT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET

JENNIFER

Oh God Gale, Dewey was right.

Stop getting so nervous and you

might stop causing me to gag!

DEWEY/GALE

(together)

SHUT UP!

JENNIFER

I think Milton's the killer.

I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

GALE

Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.

He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack

-off parties he has with his two best friends.

JENNIFER

Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

GALE

(smacks her forehead out of frustration)

Do you get any of my witty humor?

I mean, you did play me for three movies.

(a beat)

His two hands, dingus.

DEWEY

Ssh ladies.

MILTON

(into phone)

John Milton.

VOICE

Wanna play a game?

MILTON

Who is this?

VOICE

You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me.

MILTON

It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie!

(a beat)

I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and

have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of

shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the

lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was

besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John

Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll

be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up

from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed

by John Sayles.

VOICE

Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film.

Well, at least not for you.

CUT TO:

DEWEY

Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

GALE

Oh Dewey I'm sorry.

GALE

Here. Let me --

JENNIFER

Excuse me Gale! What the hell

do you think you're doing?

DEWEY

(shaking it off)

Let's get this drawer open.

If it's locked, there must be something

inside he's trying to hide.

GALE

Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.

JENNIFER

What? What'd you find?

GALE

Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never

going to believe who Milton's kid is.

DEWEY

Who is it?

JENNIFER

(nervously)

Guys! I got a bad feeling.

DEWEY/GALE

(angrily, together)

NOT NOW!

JENNIFER

Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!

DEWEY

Huh?

DEWEY

(frantic)

Gale run!

GALE

(screaming)

Dewey!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Jesus Gale what happened?

GALE

(frantic)

He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!

(realizing)

DEWEY! Dewey's in there too!

He needs medical help!

He's hurt!

DETECTIVE KINCAID

Alright, calm down. I'm going

to radio in for backup right now.

VOICE(O.S.)

Not so fast. We're not finished.

VOICE

I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.

It's only gonna end up with you getting

Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.

GALE

(nervously)

Awfully late time to be doing an interview.

VOICE

I need you as bait. For Sidney.

I can only hear myself.

VOICE

SIDNEY

VOICE

The question isn't who I am.  The question is,

who's with me.

GALE

(screaming)

Sidney, stay away!

VOICE

Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract

attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.

Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

SIDNEY

Yes.

VOICE

Go there.

VOICE

Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.

When you're friends with Sidney, you die!

Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.

It's up to you.

SIDNEY

How do I know their voices are --

VOICE

Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?

How do you know I'm not someone in your head?

Somewhere, you know.

DEWEY

(frantic)

Don't come here Sidney!

GALE

Dewey! No!

VOICE

Or do you?

SIDNEY

You're dead!

VOICE

I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple.

You show yourself, they survive, you run,

they die!

GALE

Oh God!  Oh God!

VOICE

Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to

know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who

killed your mother?

COP(O.S.)

Have you seen Kincaid?

COP 2(O.S.)

NO.  But Wallace is around.

SIDNEY

Where?

VOICE

She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

SIDNEY

VOICE

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can

VOICE

It's good to see you again Sidney.

I was growing real impatient.

Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

SIDNEY

DEWEY(O.S.)

(off phone)

Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

SIDNEY

Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!

DEWEY(O.S.)

SIDNEY

DEWEY(O.S.)

I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid!

The killer's looking for you!

Quick untie me!

DEWEY(O.S.)

Good work Sid.

GHOST

(Sid's voice)

You play a good game Sidney.

Now it's time to get down to business.

SIDNEY

Who are you?

GHOST

(click-now he's Maureen's voice)

Your other half.

The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the

SIDNEY

GALE!

GALE

Christ Sidney hurry up!

That fucking lunatic is coming!

SIDNEY

Gale he's got Dewey!

GALE

SIDNEY

(screaming)

GALE WATCHOUT!

SIDNEY

(eyes lighting up)

Dewey!

DEWEY

Where's Gale?

SIDNEY

They've got her!

DEWEY

Sid I want you to stay here!

I'll be right back!

I'm not gonna let them get Gale!

DEWEY

(tightening grip on gun)

Hold it right there you fucker!

DEWEY

(nervously)

OH shit!

SIDNEY

(crying)

Oh God.

ANGELINA

Time to sort things out.

Whatta you say?

SIDNEY

It's you?! All of this is because of you?

ANGELINA

No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really

wants to meet you.

ANGELINA

Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off.

Not now.

VOICE(O.S.)

You're not going anywhere Sidney.

It's time you came to terms with me, and with

mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.

Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.

SIDNEY

Who the hell are you?

THE GHOST

The other half of you! I searched for a mother too,

an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her

my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked

her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome

me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a

new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only

child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold

forever, her own son!

ROMAN

Roman Bridger, director. And brother.

(a beat)

She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was

Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me,

what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little

home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen,

mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one

thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father,

that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing

his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And

once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was

a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case

you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like

her was making a movie.

SIDNEY

All the nightmares. All the hell I went through

was because of you, you spineless bastard!

ROMAN

I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example,

Angelina over there,

(Angelina smiles)

She's my partner. I can convince her to do

anything.  We've been dating since I met her in

Woodsboro.

SIDNEY

(dryly)

Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

ANGELINA

That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You

were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney.

I wanted to make you proud.

ROMAN

And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of

a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every

time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.

SIDNEY

(repulsed)

Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit

before! So lets get on with it!

ROMAN

Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.

You haven't seen the best part.

(pulls out tape recorder)

With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've

been able to steal your voice.

(presses play)

Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna

find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

SIDNEY

(off tape recorder)

I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation

of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to

make you all repent for your sins, and now

I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.

ROMAN

(clicking off tape recorder)

Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that

John Milton, was my daddy?

Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.

His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!

That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.

Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone

in this world. What a good reason to --

STAB MYSELF!

ROMAN

See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,

they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,

they also set the stage for you! Introducing

to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the

survivor! Sidney the star!

ROMAN

See Sid, now comes the part where we get away

with it! The part where we win! Cause face it

Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

SIDNEY

Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you

kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and

not because of any other fucking reason!

ANGELINA

(screaming)

Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's

freaking me out!

ROMAN

(screaming)

God damn it Sidney!

GALE

(coughing)

Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain

Gale Weathers.

GALE

(leaping up)

I know all the tricks!

SIDNEY

Dewey my God I thought you were dead.

DEWEY

Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

SIDNEY

DEWEY! IT'S GALE!

GALE

(screaming)

THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!

BITCH!

DEWEY

Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always

superhuman.

SIDNEY

He wasn't superhuman Dewey.

He wasn't superhuman at all.

GALE

WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!

SIDNEY

(pissed)

This shit is really getting repetitive,

you know?

CUT TO:

DEWEY

Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what

if we try it out again.

The whole relationship thing.

GALE

(smiles)

Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE WALLACE

Jesus Christ what happened?

I leave for two seconds to take my

kid to the doctor, I come back and it's

the fucking WILD BUNCH.

SIDNEY

It was just something that's been itching

to be completed for the past four years.

DETECTIVE WALLACE

I guess so.

SIDNEY

Take care Detective. Give my regards

to the wife and kids.
