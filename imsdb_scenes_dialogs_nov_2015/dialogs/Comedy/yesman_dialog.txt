KATH

You don't do anything more. You

used to be fun. Now you hardly

ever even leave your apartment.

CARL

I'm here, aren't I?

KATH

That's because it's New Year's Eve.

You have to be here. Besides, it's

not only social stuff. You used to

have dreams. You wanted to go to

business school, you wanted to work

for the World Bank.

CARL

So I discovered b-school's not for

me. People grow.

KATH

Growing is "X is not for me so I'll

do Y." You went X is not for me

and so I guess I'll sit on the

couch for the rest of my life.

CARL

(ACQUIESCING)

Well, look, this sucks, but I

understand where you're coming

from.

KATH

This is the problem. You don't

even care that I'm breaking up with

you.

CARL

Of course I care.   But I also

understand.

KATH

You shouldn't just understand. You

should be mad. Or upset. Or sad.

Or something.

2.

CARL

We're at different places in our

lives. I get it.

KATH

Your girlfriend of two years breaks

up with you right before New Year's

Eve and all you can say is "I get

it?" It is completely within your

right to call me a bitch.

CARL

That would be inappropriate.

KATH

(tearing up)

I can't believe I've been dating

someone so emotionless.

CARL

C'mere.   It'll be OK.

PATRONS

Three, two, one... happy New Year!

PATRONS (cont'd)

(SINGING)

Should auld acquaintance be forgot

and never brought to mind? Should

auld acquaintance be forgot and

days of auld lang syne?

CARL

Well, that was fantastic.   Good

night, guys.

PETER

You're going, already?

3.

KATH

We haven't even finished the song

yet.

CARL

I saw the ball drop and hugged all

of you. Aliens didn't invade. Our

computers are still working. What

else could possibly happen?

LUCY

Rooney might throw up.

ROONEY

It's true.     I'm very close.

CARL

I see that happen like every night.

Good night and Happy New Year.

LUCY

How did he take the break-up?

KATH

(CRYING)

Like a robot. Two years, and

nothing.

LUCY

I'm so sorry.

4.

RENEE

Wanna rock out tonight?

CARL

I don't rock out.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Would you like an Italian-inspired

coffee flavoring?

CARL

No thanks.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

How about the double doughnut

special?

CARL

No.

CARL

(reading the email)

Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to

introduce myself. I am the deposed

King of Nigeria and I wish to

propose a confidential transaction.

(to the computer)

Allow me to delete you, my liege.

NORMAN

My teller reporting for duty.

CARL

I'm not a soldier.

NORMAN

You're a soldier on the front line

of finance.

(THEN)

(MORE)

5.

NORMAN (cont'd)

So, Carl, I'm having a party this

Friday. It's a funny hat party.

May I entreat you to come?

CARL

(clearly lying)

I'm out of town.

BANK CUSTOMER

Hey, I need to speak to a loan

specialist and there's no one on

the floor.

CARL

Sorry. Today I'm officially a

greeter.

BANK CUSTOMER

But there's no one around.

CARL

Someone might come. And if I'm not

here, they won't be greeted.

BANK CUSTOMER

You're really not going to help me?

CARL

Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my

hands are tied.

6.

CHRIS PARKER

Hey, there. I'm Chris Parker. The

new president of Southwest Bank.

Just wanted to come by and

personally introduce myself to

every branch manager.

NORMAN

That would be me.   Norman Calhoun.

CARL

I'm Carl Kendall.   Just a teller.

CHRIS PARKER

I was "just a teller." And now I'm

"just president of the largest bank

in the Southwest."

(to Norman)

You need anything, you let

corporate know. You hear?

NORMAN

Definitely.

NORMAN (cont'd)

Nice work if you can get it.   Am I

right?

CARL

(clearly jealous)

Yeah, if you're into fake breasts

and German engineering.

NORMAN

Check and check.

BANK CUSTOMER

Can you help me now?

CARL

No, but this gentleman can.

7.

NORMAN

Think about my party, Carl!

CARL

Will do!

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Would you like an Italian --

CARL

No thanks.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

How about --

CARL

No.

8.

NORMAN

Valentine party. Just wear

something red!

CARL

Can't.

CARL

No.

NORMAN

Dress as your favorite animal --

CARL

Sorry.

9.

NORMAN

-- historical figure --

CARL

No can do.

CARL

Hello?

PETER (V.O.)

(on the phone)

Carl. It's Peter. Where are you?

CARL

I'm in bed. Why?       What happened?

Did someone die?

10.

PETER (V.O.)

(on the phone)

No. It's just -- we're at Rudy's.

Celebrating New Year's.

CARL

It's already 11:15.     I don't think

I can make it.

PETER

Oh, c'mon, Carl. No one's seen you

for like forever. Please swing by?

CARL

No.

CARL (cont'd)

Tell everyone Happy New Year.

ALEX

Carl Kendall?

CARL

Alex Eberts? What's up, buddy?

ALEX

Too much! How've you been? I

can't believe you're still working

here.

CARL

Where've you been? Norman's been

heartbroken since you quit.

11.

ALEX

Where've I been? You mean, where

haven't I been? This year. Dude.

I have lived. I climbed Mt.

Kilmanjaro. I ate bat in Laos. I

shot a cow with a bazooka. I'm not

proud of that last one but I did

it. How's the bank?

CARL

Same old same old.

ALEX

See? That's the problem. That's

everyone's problem. You've got one

life. Why waste it on the same old

same old?

ALEX (cont'd)

I know this will sound queer, but

you have to hit this seminar. It

changed my life. It will change

yours. Unless you like the bank.

CARL

You kidding? Every day it's

impossible not to throw rocks at

the place.

(JOKING)

Since you don't work here anymore,

you want to throw a couple?

ALEX

Yes.

CARL

What're you doing!   Stop that!   I

was kidding!

NORMAN

What do you think you're doing?

(recognizing Alex)

Alex Eberts! Is this an alumnae

prank? I love pranks!

ALEX

Hey, Norman!

12.

NORMAN

(into a walkie-talkie)

We have a situation.

ALEX

Go to the seminar, Carl!    You won't

be sorry!

PETER (V.O.)

(over the answering

MACHINE)

Carl, it's Peter. I know you don't

do things anymore, but it'd mean a

lot if you'd come by Rudy's

tonight. Lucy and I are

celebrating our engagement.

CARL

What are you doing here?

PETER

This is an intervention.    You've

missed your last event.

CARL

What're you talking about?

PETER

Our engagement party.

CARL

I'm sorry.     I'm just really busy.

13.

PETER

CARL

PETER

14.

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

(SHOCKED)

(doing the math)

PETER

15.

CARL

(starting to panic)

I was making out with chicks by

fourth grade. I was a little man

by fourth grade.

(THEN)

Whatever. I don't need this shit

right now. I'm an adult man. I

can live my life as I see fit. Can

you please leave?

MATCH CUT TO:

WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN

Is this your first time at one of

Sanji's lectures?

CARL

(SCOFFING)

Uh, yeah.

(THEN)

Have you been to this before?

WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN

Only like fifty-eight times.

Sanji's a genius. Like

seriously... he will blow your mind

all over the goddamn room. He's

like a mind grenade.

CARL

I don't know if I want that.

WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN

Oh you do not. But you need it.

And that's why you are here.

CARL

Cool. Do you want anything from

the refreshment area?

16.

WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN

You kidding? That processed shit

will kill you faster than a

pleasure cruise to Chernobyl.

SANJI (V.O.)

Life.   We are all living it.

SANJI (V.O.) (cont'd)

Or are we? Change doesn't start on

the surface. It's generated from

consciousness. But where is

consciousness generated from?

SANJI (cont'd)

From the external. And the

external is manipulated through our

choices. And our choices start

with one word.

SANJI (cont'd)

Yes!

SANJI (cont'd)

Say yes! For your life! Yes!

Change starts now! Yes! Yes!

Yes! Say it with me! SAY YES!

SANJI (cont'd)

Are you ready to open the door to

yes?

17.

CROWD

Yes!

SANJI

I am sorry, my friends.      But I

cannot hear you?

CROWD

Yes!

SANJI

Shhhhhhh.

SANJI (cont'd)

Now is the time when we must greet

our new members. Who here is new?

Please, do not be shy.

WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN

He is!

SANJI

Come on up, Future Yes Man!

CARL

That's OK.     I'm just auditing.

SANJI

You can't audit life!      Now get on

up here!

CARL

I'm cool right here.

SANJI

Then I will come to you!

SANJI (cont'd)

What is your name?

CARL

Carl.

18.

SANJI

Let me guess, Carl. This was not

your idea to come here, Carl.

CARL

I wouldn't say that.

SANJI

You can tell me, Carl.    We are all

alone, Carl.

CARL

It wasn't exactly my idea.

SANJI

That's what I thought, Carl. And

you think this is all bullshit,

Carl, isn't that right, Carl?

CARL

Honestly?

SANJI

Is there any other way?

CARL

This whole thing seems retarded.

SANJI

But you are stuck in your life,

Carl? Am I right?

CARL

I wouldn't necessarily --

SANJI

You once had a dream? You wanted

to own a boat? A house? A fancy

car? You wanted to a doctor, a

lawyer... a business man?

SANJI (cont'd)

You wanted to be more than you are.

And yet you have suddenly woken up

to find life is passing you by. Am

I right, Carl?

19.

CARL

A little.

SANJI

It's odd that ten years can pass

just like that.

SANJI (cont'd)

Isn't it, Carl?

CARL

It is.

SANJI

I want you to do something for me,

Carl. Tomorrow, I want you only to

say yes. Can you do that for me?

For one day, Carl?

CARL

I'm not sure --

SANJI

Please, Carl. Do it for me and you

will be doing it for yourself. If

you don't have the best day in ten

years then I am the uncle of a

monkey. Will you do it for me

Carl? Just for a day?

CARL

Yes?

SANJI

Welcome to the world of yes!

20.

CARL

Yello.

PETER (V.O.)

(on the phone)

Carl, it's Peter. I just wanted to

apologize about barging in

yesterday. You were right. It's

your life to live.

CARL

Don't worry about it.

PETER (V.O.)

(on the phone)

Me, Lucy and Kath are all going out

for brunch. You have any interest

in joining?

CARL

Oh, thanks for the invite, but...

SANJI

Will you do it for me Carl?       Just

for a day?

CARL

(in slo-mo)

Yes.

PETER

Excuse me?

CARL

(clearly not wanting to)

Yes. I will come to brunch.

KATH

(AWKWARD)

Morning, Carl. This is a surprise.

CARL

Why?

21.

KATH

Because I've never seen you at

brunch. Like ever.

CARL

You kidding? I love brunch.

CARL

Why do people wait an hour for

breakfast? It's so hot and bright

and we haven't even had coffee yet.

PETER

If you don't want to be here, you

don't have to be.

CARL

Of course I want to be here. I

love waiting an hour for eggs.

It's fun. Although I will point

out that you have sunglasses which

is probably making this wait a lot

easier.

PETER

Oakleys, polarized lenses,

indestructible. Two fifty but

worth every penny.

WAITRESS

Lowell, party of five.

CARL

We were definitely before those

Lowell people.

KATH

I hate when people jump ahead.

CARL

Why does no one ever say anything?

22.

PETER

If you want to be sitting so bad,

why don't you say something?

CARL

Yes.   I will.

CARL (cont'd)

Excuse me, but we were here before

those people.

WAITRESS

No you weren't.

CARL

Yes, we were.

WAITRESS

I have the list, dude.   The list

doesn't lie.

CARL

Well, this time the list lied.

LUCY

It's OK, Carl. It's just brunch.

CARL

(to the people who are

being seated)

You all know that we were up before

you! And you have to live with

that knowledge through your

delightful brunch!

PETER

What's going on with you?

CARL

I just want transparency in terms

of the brunch seating order.

23.

KATH

Great. Now we're going to get into

a fight.

BRUNCH DUDE

We talked about what you said...

you're right. You guys were here

before us. Sorry we didn't pipe up

sooner. We cool, brother?

CARL

(SURPRISED)

Yeah. We cool.

LUCY

It's a two bedroom duplex with

harbor views. It'd be perfect for

you Kath.

KATH

Washer/Dryer in the building?

CARL

(JEALOUS)

I didn't realize you were looking

to buy a place. I thought you and I

would be renters to the end.

PETER

She's a fancy lawyer making bank.

It's about time she was buying.

KATH

(PLAYFUL)

Shut up.

PETER

(re: the menus)

What're you looking at?

CARL

Bacon and eggs.

24.

KATH

How unadventurous.

CARL

I don't want an adventure first

thing in the morning.

WAITRESS

I just want to tell you about my

specials. We have a double fruit

burnt sugar waffle. Any of you

interested in that?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Alrighty. Then, on the savory

side, we have a smoked whitefish

omelet with hash browns on the

side. Any takers?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

(SURPRISED)

You want both?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Would you like toast with that?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Any side?    Bacon.

CARL

Yes.

25.

WAITRESS

Sausage.

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Turkey sausage?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

A side of our famous maple pancakes

--

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Wow.    Someone's really hungry.

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Coffee or juice?

CARL

Coffee.    And juice.

WAITRESS

We also have smoothies?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Is that all?

CARL

(RELIEVED)

Yes.

WAITRESS

(turning towards his

FRIENDS)

What would you all like to order?

26.

WAITRESS

Would you like some pepper?

CARL

Yes.

WAITRESS

Would you like more?

CARL

Yes.

PETER

I don't think I've ever seen a

waiter tap one of those pepper

mills.

CARL

I'm just addicted to the stuff.

Chinese cultures say it's good for

digestion.

(THEN)

You're all welcome to have some.

LUCY

That's... OK. Do you want a bite

of mine?

CARL

(BEGRUDGINGLY)

Yes.

27.

CARL (cont'd)

Uch. Brunch coffee. Why can't

they make it black without all this

frothy shit?

PETER

Because you ordered a latte.

NORMAN (O.S.)

Hey, Carl. We're a little short on

our Saturday staff. I know this is

going against ten years of

precedent, but you have any

interest in coming in today?

CARL

I don't think... there's any reason

why I shouldn't? On a Saturday

there's nothing I like more than

the inside of a bank.

NORMAN (O.S.)

There really is something magical

about this place.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Would you like an Italian-inspired

coffee flavoring?

CARL

Yes.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet?

CARL

All of them please.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

We're having a special on

Munchkins?

28.

RENEE

Want a flier? Oh, it's you.    Never

mind.

CARL

Of course I'll take a flier.

CARL (cont'd)

(READING)

The Flying Buttresses.

RENEE

I knew after a year and a half of

wearing you down, you'd give in.

I'm Renee by the way.

CARL

Carl.

RENEE

Carl. Cool. I like to thank

everyone personally who comes to

our performances. It gives it a

nice intimate touch. See you soon

Carl.

NORMAN

Morning, Carl. Thanks for coming

in and being part of the Saturday

banking experience. Oooh,

Munchkins. Are those for the

office, you dirty devil?

29.

CARL

Yeah. I just though it would be a

fun way to lighten things up.

NORMAN

(deadly serious)

You didn't approve this with petty

cash.

CARL

I spent my own money on them...

NORMAN

Kidding! Munchkins are always

approved. Although, I can't

reimburse you.

(over the intercom)

Today is free Munchkin day. That's

right! Free Munchkin day!

BANK EMPLOYEES

Carl rules./You're the

best./Finally I have a reason to

live today.

CARL

How may I help you?

BANK CUSTOMER

I need to speak to a loan

specialist.

CARL

While loans aren't normally in my

jurisdiction, I'd be happy to help

you.

30.

BANK CUSTOMER

I want to refi my house and spend

the capital on my personal

business. I see you've got a 5.25

7 year ARM, but over at Chase

they're offering 5.00 7 year ARM.

Can you refi lower, like at 4.85

par example, or am I going to have

to bring my beeswax elsewhere?

CARL

Yes.

BANK CUSTOMER

Yes?   That's it?

CARL

Yup.   What's your business?

BANK CUSTOMER

Selling beanie babies online.

CARL

Adorable.

BANK CUSTOMER

More like highly profitable.    I've

crunched the numbers.

CARL

Let me just get final approval on

this.

NORMAN

You're a teller, not a loan

specialist.

CARL

No, I know, so if you think this is

a bad idea for a loan that's fine

but can you please tell her

yourself?

31.

NORMAN

What's this?

CARL

Her business plan.

NORMAN

Inta-maresting. My grandma loves

beanie babies. Although

unfortunately, we have a minimum

loan floor of ten thousand dollars.

She only wants five.

CARL

That's silly. How're you supposed

to start a tiny business if you

can't get a tiny business loan?

NORMAN

I don't make the rules, I just

break `em.

(THEN)

I don't break them. I just wanted

to rhyme. If she wants us to loan

her ten thousand or more, great.

Otherwise, I think her only option

is a loan shark.

BANK CUSTOMER

(NERVOUS)

So, what'd he say?

CARL

Do you maybe have any interest in

borrowing ten thousand?

BANK CUSTOMER

I can't afford the payments on ten.

You can't do five thousand? This

is the fifth bank I've been to.

Please?

CARL

Of course we can.    One moment

please.

32.

CARL (cont'd)

Diet Coke?

NORMAN

Oooh, thank you. Feed the

addiction, am I right?

CARL

It's approved.

BANK CUSTOMER

Thank you so much! I promise I

won't let you down, Mr. Kendall.

On me.

CARL

Thanks, Marge. We don't like to

make other customers jealous so can

we keep this between you and I?

BANK CUSTOMER

Of course.     Aren't you just a dear?

NORMAN

Carl, could I see you for a moment?

33.

NORMAN

Earlier today, you showed some

initiative. And I loved it. What

do you say to a permanent spot at

the loan desk?

CARL

That seems like a lot of

responsibility.

NORMAN

We need a loan specialist a lot

more than we need a teller and

greeter. Besides, you'd have a

starting salary of 52.

CARL

Grand?

NORMAN

No, dollars. What is this Darfur?

(waving to an African-

American employee)

Sorry, Patricia, that was

inappropriate.

(then, back to Carl)

Of course grand. To celebrate,

next Saturday, I'm throwing a

party. Dress up as your favorite

character from Heroes.

(WHISPERING)

Save the cheerleader, save the

world.

CARL

Next Saturday... sounds great.

NORMAN

Don't dress as Hiro.    I got dibs.

CARL

Wouldn't think of it.

34.

ROONEY

Carl Kendall? Out in the world?

Are you some kind of ghost? Am I

having a religious vision?

CARL

Believe it. Because this guy just

got a promotion.

LUCY

Congrats, Carl!

ROONEY

Well let's get you a beer. You

want a 20 ouncer? I'm just joking -

-

CARL

Yes.

PETER

A normal-sized beer is fine with

me.

LUCY

I think I'm done actually.

ROONEY

Two twenty ouncers and one tiny,

little beer, barkeep.

BARTENDER

Please don't call me that.   We're

not in the middle ages.

ROONEY

(to Carl)

I can't believe you're out here.

I'm giddy. I feel like a child

whose best friend has strict

Chinese parents who never let him

come out and play but now his

Chinese parents are away for the

Chinese New Year. You have any

interest in pounding this shit?

35.

CARL

Why not?

ROONEY

What do you say we have another?

CARL

Yes.

ROONEY

You are a beast!

LUCY

Well, it's been fun watching you

guys recreate freshman year, but

Peter and I have some furniture

errands to run.

CARL

Have a good day yuppifying your

lives.

PETER

We need a sofa, Carl.     We're not

buying a second home.

ROONEY

Whatever, yuppy sellouts.

LUCY

It was good seeing you.    You should

come out more often.

CARL

(kind of pleading)

Please don't leave me here with

him.

36.

CARL

I have not been this drunk in

years! The room is spinning in a

bad way!

ROONEY

Barkeep! Two more double pints

s'il vous plait!

BARTENDER

That was the last `barkeep.'   I am

cutting you off.

ROONEY

Well fortunately you're not the

only game in town! Let's go to

some place with class.

CARL

Where's the class?

ROONEY

They wear uniforms here.

SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS

Jello shot?

CARL

Yes.

CARL (cont'd)

That girl is hot. Or at least she

seems hot. I'm kind of too drunk

to tell. Right now, honestly, you

seem hot.

37.

ROONEY

I am hot.

SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS

Another jello shot?

CARL                               ROONEY

SENOR FROG'S DJ

Senor Frog's famous karoake contest

is starting now! Sign up and sweep

us off our feet!

ROONEY

You gotta do karoake.

CARL

Sign me up, bitch.

SENOR FROG'S DJ

We've got our first victim... I

mean, singer.

CARL

(singing/talking with an

odd English accent)

Just tell me what you've got to say

to me, I've been waiting for so

long to hear the truth, It comes as

no surprise at all you see, So cut

the crap and tell me that we're

through. Now I know your heart, I

know your mind, You don't even know

you're being unkind, So much for

all your highbrow Marxist ways,

Just use me up and then you walk

away, Boy you can't play me that

way.

38.

CARL (cont'd)

Well I guess what you say is true,

I could never be the right kind of

girl for you, I could never be your

woman.

CARL (cont'd)

Well I guess what they say is true,

I could never spend my life with a

man like you, I could never be your

woman. I could never be your

woman. I could never be your

woman.

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

Were you just flirting with my

girlfriend?

CARL

(re: the Hot Girl)

It depends -- is that your

girlfriend?

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

Yes.

CARL

Then yes.

HOT GIRL

Hey, c'mon. Be cool.    He was just

screwing around.

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

Let me handle this, Crystal.

(to Carl)

So, you want to have sex with my

girlfriend?

39.

CARL

Yes, I do.     Very much.

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

Are you starting a fight?

ROONEY

C'mon, Carl, let's go --

CARL

Yes, I am.

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

Then bring it.

CARL

I will.

BRUTISH BOYFRIEND

What was that?

CARL

Me bringing it.

CARL (cont'd)

I'm too drunk to feel!  I'm like

Darkman!

ROONEY

You popped that guy!    He didn't

know what hit him.

CARL

You do not cross Carl Kendall.

40.

HOT GIRL

Hey. I'm sorry about Domingo. He

likes to think he's my boyfriend

but he's not. You're cute.

HOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D)

Want to go some place private?

CARL

Yes.

HOT GIRL

My fiance called. He was like

really sorry about last night.      I

have to go.

CARL

Your fiance?

HOT GIRL

Domingo. The guy who punched you

in the face.

CARL

I thought you said you two weren't

even dating?

HOT GIRL

We were broken up last night.      It

was fun hanging out.

HOT GIRL (cont'd)

I made some coffee. It's in the

kitchen. Sorry for leading you on.

41.

CARL

Hi... is there a Sanji Gupta

staying here?

RECEPTIONIST

Room 125.

CARL

I'm Carl.    The guy from yesterday.

SANJI

Of course, of course!      Please come

in!

SANJI (cont'd)

Would you like a cup of coffee?

CARL

No thanks. I just wanted to thank

you for that inspiration.

SANJI

Fantastic. So how do you plan on

continuing with your journey?

CARL

You know, just living every day to

it's fullest. And, like, learning

to continue to experience life or

whatever.

SANJI

Outstanding, Carl. Except for one

THING:

(suddenly intense)

You are completely bullshitting me!

42.

CARL

I just said I'm going to keep

experiencing life. I thought you'd

be happy.

SANJI

You're like a cigarette addict,

Carl. Except you're addicted to

boredom. On the way in here, Carl,

I offered you a coffee and you

refused. Perhaps that would have

been the most delicious cup of

coffee you would have ever had.

Who's to say? Not you, Carl,

because you said no! Anyone can

quit smoking for a day. But for a

lifetime? No.

CARL

So what should I do?

SANJI

Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto.

CARL

(reading the document)

1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say

yes. 2) The yes cannot distort the

truth.

SANJI

(EXPLAINING)

You cannot say "Yes, the world is

flat" because that is an untruth.

CARL

(reading the document)

3) If someone discovers you are a

yes man, you do not have to say yes

to them. 4) To avoid yes, you

cannot avoid contact. Therefore,

you must always answer your phone,

the door, your postal mail, your

email, etc and so on and so forth.

5) You must choose a yesponsor to

keep you on the straight and

narrow.

(to Sanji)

Who should that be?

43.

SANJI

A close friend who will not tell a

soul.

CARL

(reading the document)

5) I hereby void the "do you want"

loophole.

(to Sanji)

What is that?

SANJI

If someone asks you "do you want to

go to the art museum" and you do

not want to, you may not use this

lack of desire as an excuse to not

go. And finally, a warning.

(SPOOKILY)

If you say `no', even once, even

for a cup of coffee, be prepared to

lose every single little thing

you've gained.

(THEN)

So what do you say, Carl?

(WHISPERING)

What do you say?

CARL

I say... yes.

SANJI

And here.

SANJI (cont'd)

And here.

SANJI (cont'd)

And initial here. And here.

CARL

Is this like a legal document?

SANJI

Kind of. And finally, my friend,

please hold out your hand.

44.

CARL

AHHHHHHHH!

SANJI

That should heal by New Year's.

Until then, you are a Yes Man.

PETER

For a whole year?

CARL

Yesterday I got promoted and beat

up and hooked up with this chick

and I have a massive headache today

and I still might throw up, but I

don't care because it was the best

time I've had in like forever. Not

to mention finding out that,

despite what you might think,

smoked whitefish in an omelette is

delicious, even if covered in a

thick layer of pepper.

PETER

But for a whole year?

CARL

You don't   understand. I got

promoted.    Do you know how long

I've been   waiting for some kind of

financial   step forward? I said

`yes' and   it arrived.

PETER

Well, someone sounds like they're

yuppifying their life.

CARL

Excuse me for wanting an appliance

in my kitchen besides a hot pot.

45.

PETER

There's no way you can do this for

a whole year.

CARL

That's where you come in.   You're

my "Yesponsor."

PETER

Yesponsor?

CARL

Like in AA. I need you to hold me

to it.

PETER

You aren't going to last for more

than a week.

CARL

I look forward to proving you

wrong.

CARL (cont'd)

Nice suit. If I move up anymore at

the bank, I might need a few.

PETER

Cavalli. Silk and cotton blend.

Seven fifty.

LUCY

My girlfriends are being such

bitches. It's been two weeks and

no one's offered to throw me a

wedding shower.

PETER

That's too bad. I'm sure someone

will offer.

LUCY

(SARCASTIC)

Hey, you want to throw my wedding

shower?

46.

CARL

(dreading it)

I'd be happy to.

LUCY

I was kidding. Wedding showers are

thrown by girls.

CARL

That's sexist. Please.      I insist.

LUCY

Thanks.    That means a lot to me.

ROONEY

That was some good times last

night. You back for more?

CARL

Yes.

ROONEY

I've got no cash. You mind

spotting me and my buddies?

PETER

Sorry, didn't bring my wallet.

CARL

(BEGRUDGINGLY)

Yes.

CARL (cont'd)

What kind of beer do you guys want?

ROONEY'S FRIENDS/ROONEY

As long as you're buying, I want a

Grey Goose straight up./Kir

Royale/Whatever's in that dusty

bottle back there that you never

take down.

47.

CARL

Black coffee, large.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Would you like...

CARL

(cutting her off)

To have a wonderful day?    I would.

CARL (cont'd)

(RESIGNED)

And could I also have a Mocha

Caramel Coolata.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

With whipped cream?

RENEE

Hey, give that back.    You already

took one.

CARL

What's the hurt in taking another?

48.

RENEE

Destroys the Earth. Also, they

cost me ten cents a copy. Besides,

are you even going to come?

CARL

Of course.     I couldn't say `no.'

CARL (cont'd)

Even if I wanted to.

RENEE

See you tonight, Carl!

CARL

Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I

would love to help you anyway I can

with your confidential transaction.

Please let me know what I can do.

Yours, Carl Kendall.

CARL (cont'd)

Would I like Viagra? Yes, I would.

CARL (cont'd) (CONT'D)

Do I want a Persian wife? Perhaps

I do.

CARL (cont'd)

Norman, would you say I prefer

Iranian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or

no preference?

49.

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

You Carl Kendall?

CARL

Yeah.

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

I hear that you do small loans.

CARL

Where did you hear that?

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

Marge. The lady my mom buys her

beanie babies from.

CARL

I told her not to say anything.

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

I only need five hundred bucks.

I'm starting college next year and

I need it for books. I can't

afford them now but I can pay them

off over the course of the year.

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL (cont'd)

Thank you so much, Mr. Kendall.

CARL

I might have some stuff to pawn./I

will definitely check out your gun

selection./I would like to learn

Korean.

BERLITZ FLIER GUY

If you're interested, intro to

Korean is starting right now.

50.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[Hello, my name is Carl.   What is

your name?]

RENEE

Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and

Rodrigo. We are the Flying

Buttresses!

RENEE (cont'd)

(SINGING)

Everyday, the unicorns they

play/Among lingonberry fields/They

silently bay/The king has no

crown/Just a vest of grass/The

queen loves the Jester/The Jester

has the last laugh.

(CHORUS)

You are my minotaur/With your

cloven hooves!/Half man, half

horse/You are all boy to me

51.

RENEE (cont'd)

A witches cauldron/burns hot as

hell/As her crooked hand/Brews a

love spell.

RENEE (cont'd)

I! Am!   A! Fairy!/I! Like!    To

Fly!

BARTENDER

Nice, show Renee. One virgin mint

soda coming right up.

RENEE

I don't think I hit a high enough

octave in Fairy Dream Song.

CARL

I disagree. I think you hit some

pretty high octaves.

RENEE

But I can hit like way higher.

(as she speaks her voice

goes higher and higher)

Like check this out. I think this

tone might be more appropriate for

my water nymph song?

CARL

(speaking in a low voice)

I don't know -- I've known some

water nymphs with big balls.

(no reaction)

From the high level of

testosterone.

52.

RENEE

I've got to write a song about

that. I could call it...

CARL

"Big Balled Water Nymph"?       It's a

working title.

RENEE

I like it.     I can work with that.

LEEORE

Um, excuse me, but we have to clear

the stage.

RENEE

I gotta clear.

(JOKING)

Unless of course, you want to help?

CARL

Sure.   I love clearing stages.

RENEE

Well, thanks for coming, Carl.      I

must bid good night.

CARL

So early?     It's only 8:00?

RENEE

I lead a jogging, photo group for

people who want to both exercise

and practice photography.

CARL

You're a photographer too?

RENEE

Amateur, but yeah.    I show every

Friday.

(MORE)

53.

RENEE (cont'd)

If you want to do some artistic

calisthenics join us tomorrow.

CARL

What time do you leave?

RENEE

Five.   So we can see the sunrise.

CARL

Wow. I haven't seen the sunrise

maybe ever.

(RESIGNED)

I guess now I'll be doing that

tomorrow.

RENEE

Oh, it's beautiful. Makes great

photos. Nice meeting you, Carl.

FLIER GUY

You interested in learning Spanish?

KATH (O.S.)

Thinking of learning a couple

foreign languages?

CARL

Hey, Kath. Would you like one?

I'm going to learn Swahili.

KATH

Maybe next week. There's someone

you should probably meet. Carl,

this is Seb.

CARL

Seb?    What is that?   Swedish?

SEB

Yes.

54.

SEB (cont'd)

I've heard a lot about you, Carl.

SEB (cont'd)

Sorry, sweetie. I've got to take

this.

CARL

You're on a date then?

KATH

Yeah.   Met him at my firm.

CARL

He's very tall.

KATH

I guess so, yeah.

CARL

Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb.

So I'll be going.

SEB

Unless... you'd like to join us?

SEB (cont'd)

It was good meeting you --

CARL

I'd love to. Join you guys.

KATH

What?

55.

CARL

So, how did you guys meet?

KATH

I told you. Through the firm.

WAITER

Would you like to order some wine?

KATH/CARL/SEB

Yes.

CARL

Oh, this is good.

(CHUCKLING)

I was walking past Pizza Hut the

other day, and for a second I was

sure the sign said "Pizza Hat."

And then I thought, wouldn't it be

funny if there was a shop that sold

hats shaped like pizzas?

(beat, weakly)

You know. Because it sounds like

"Pizza Hut" only it's a hat shop.

SEB

Look, Carl, why don't you just eat

your fish and fuck off?

CARL

Shit.

56.

ROONEY (O.S.)

What's up Carl? It's Rooney!      What

do you say we grab a couple

brewskis?

NIGERIAN KING (V.O.)

Dear   brother Carl, Thank you for

your   last note you sent me. But we

must   move quickly. I must have

your   bank details right now. Send

them   to me. Your Associate, Omar,

King   of Nigeria

CARL

(while typing)

Dear Omar, While I appreciate the

gravity of your situation, perhaps

a goodwill branch is in order.

Could you perhaps loan me a million

and take it out of my final cut?

Then I will happily send you my

bank details. Sincerely, Carl.

PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE

Sa'laam, Carl. You have sixty-five

winks. Allah Akbar.

CARL

Good morning.

57.

RENEE

Wow.     You look tired.

CARL

Well, it is five in the morning.

RENEE

Mammals are meant to be up at dawn.

It's how we're built biologically.

Where's your camera?

CARL

I thought I'd use my phone.

RENEE

Awesome idea. So light.

CARL

That's what I thought.

RENEE

Let's hit it.

RENEE (cont'd)

Oooh, pretty.

RENEE

Alright!    Enough standing around!

58.

IRANIAN WOMAN

It was delightful meeting you,

Carl.

CARL

As it was meeting you Farinoush.

IRANIAN WOMAN

Although I must say I was surprised

to discover that you are in no way

Persian. Nor are you six foot two.

You should change that on your

profile.

CARL

Will do.    Should I call you?

IRANIAN WOMAN

Sorry, I want a tall guy.

LUCY

Who was that?

CARL

Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I

don't think we're right for each

other.

LUCY

How'd you meet?

CARL

PersianWifeFinder.com.

(ignoring her odd look)

Let's talk wedding shower.

LUCY

So, I know it's just a wedding

shower, so who cares really?

And it's like so lame? But I've

made an appointment at a stationery

store. Are you going to totally

kill me?

59.

CARL

(dripping with sarcasm)

You kidding? I love stationery.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

This one is nice. I especially

love it in cream.

LUCY

Ooooh, pretty. What do you think?

CARL

Looks good to me.

LUCY

(sarcastic annoyance)

Thanks for your opinion.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

It's always difficult to get the

husband-to-be's opinion.

LUCY

(derisive laughter)

I'm not marrying him.

CARL

I'm just helping throw the shower.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

Oh. What's the party going to be

like? Sometimes it helps to know

that before you pick an invitation.

LUCY

Nothing special. Just hors

d'oeuvres and wine.

CARL

Look at this -- Bridal Bingo.

What's Bridal Bingo?

60.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

It's bingo, except you yell out

embarrassing facts about the bride

and whoever fills their card first

wins.

CARL

That sounds fun.

LUCY

I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.

CARL

How about a calendar shower?

LUCY

Can we concentrate at the task at

hand?

CARL

Do you even know what a calendar

shower is? Maybe a calendar shower

is awesome.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

Every guest gets assigned a month

and brings a gift that the bride

and groom can use during that

month.

LUCY

That's kind of cute.

CARL

I think that's really cute.

CARL (cont'd)

Look at this one -- "Knights in

White Armor."

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

The bride and groom ride in on a

white stallion.

CARL

You have got to do that.   Like it's

not even a choice.

61.

LUCY

That seems a little extreme.

CARL

You only get married once.

STATIONERY PROPRIETESS

Your friend happens to be right.

LUCY

You're really good at this. You

mind helping me with the wedding

invitations?

ARAB GUY

I love cell phones. I breathe cell

phones. I own, myself, thirty-five

cell phones. My brother is an

idiot and he's selling cell phones

hand over fist. What do you have?

A Nokia 9850?

ARAB GUY (cont'd)

Oooh, pretty lady.

CARL

How much do you need?

ARAB GUY

Eighty five hundred.

CARL

Done.

TEN YEAR OLD GIRL

I was with my sister? And we had

this lemonade stand? And we sold

like a hundred cups of lemonade in

two days? And so I want to expand?

(MORE)

62.

TEN YEAR OLD GIRL (cont'd)

All I need is three thousand

dollars?

JITTERY GUY

Just give me the cash.

CARL

You promise you'll pay it back?

JITTERY GUY

Basically.

NORMAN

May I speak to you, Carl?

NORMAN

I know what you're doing.

CARL

What am I doing?

NORMAN

You're loaning below our minimum.

NORMAN (cont'd)

You thought I wouldn't notice the

paperwork? I'm not the regional

manager because I ignore the

details.

CARL

I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if

you need a small amount of money

you have to go to a loan shark.

Only rich people can pay back loans

over ten grand. A bank's job is

not to just help the rich. It's to

help anyone with a dream achieve

it.

63.

NORMAN

I know. These microloans are

pretty interesting. So I'll you

spearhead a little pilot program at

the bank.

CARL

Thank you so much.

NORMAN

If corporate finds out, you're the

one who's getting fired. So keep

it quiet.

CARL

What do you need a loan for?

ROONEY

I don't. I was wondering if you

were around tonight to help me

move?

CARL

Why don't you hire movers?

ROONEY

Because it's cheaper to ask you.

ROONEY

Can you carry the fridge alone?

CARL

(SCARED)

Yes.

ROONEY

You OK?

64.

CARL

Yes.   Do you want to help at all?

ROONEY

I wish I could, but I hurt my back

trying to move that fridge.

ROONEY'S MOM

I'm going to miss you, baby.

ROONEY

And I'm going to miss you, ma.

ROONEY'S MOM

I can't watch you go.

CARL

Where are you moving?

CARL (cont'd)

(in Korean)

[What is the weather like in

Pyongyang?]

NORMAN

We need a volunteer to think up

local marketing ideas

65.

CARL

(in Spanish)

[I like to drive with my mother.]

NORMAN

We need someone to be a weekend

cashier.

NORMAN (cont'd)

We need a volunteer --

NORMAN (cont'd)

-- to be in charge of day care.

66.

TONY

Do you want to change your life

through Mahayana Buddhism?

TONY (cont'd)

Would you like to have tea and

discuss?

CARL

I'm kind of in a rush...

TONY

My place is right around the

corner.

TONY

It is only through the four noble

truths and the destruction of

desire that we can end suffering.

CARL

Well, that's really neat.

(awkward beat)

So, thanks for the books and the

jasmine tea and the vegan curry,

but I have to go --

TONY

Do you like Dionne Warwick?

TONY (cont'd)

Now she had style.

CARL

It was really great meeting you --

TONY

C'mon, Carl. Shake your groove

thang.

67.

TONY (cont'd)

I like big guys.

CARL

I really have to go.

TONY

Want to go into my bedroom?

CARL

(very quiet)

Yes.

CARL

Do you have any candles?      I just

love candles.

TONY

Sure.

CARL

How about wine?       Like a bottle of

Beaujolais?

TONY

I only have Beaujolais Nouveau.

CARL

I have herpes.

TONY

Upstairs or downstairs?

CARL

Downstairs?

68.

TONY

Front door or back door?

CARL

It's a swinging door!

TONY

Just give it!

PETER

What's with the kitten?

CARL

I just adopted her. If you're

interested, they're giving them

away in front of Petco.

PETER

I don't want a kitten.

CARL

Neither did I.

PETER'S SECRETARY

Andy Solomon on line two.

PETER

Hey, asshole, we're not talking

until you sign that goddamn

contract.

PETER (cont'd)

(totally normal)

I spoke to Kath. I hear you met

her boyfriend, Seb.

CARL

Seems like a nice guy.

69.

PETER

She was upset you went on her date.

CARL

He asked me to join them.

PETER

I think you're taking this too far.

CARL

I have no choice. I'm a yes man.

I must say yes. If Seb asks me to

join them on their date, I must.

If some dude asks me for a loan I

have to give it to them even if

it's clearly never going to be paid

back. If a guy asks me into his

bedroom, I must hook up with him.

PETER

You hooked up with a dude?

CARL

It's like hooking up with a strong

woman. I honestly don't see what

the big deal is.

(back on his yes rant)

I am guided by yes. Yes has become

my superpower. And let me tell,

yes is turning out to be a pretty

sweet deal. Now if you'll excuse

me I'm late for Korean class.

PETER

You hate Korean food.

CARL

That's no reason to write off an

entire, vibrant culture. See you

later, buddy.

70.

CARL

You really are displaying that.

RENEE

That's probably my best photo ever.

My collages aren't bad. But

personally, I think I excel at

pottery.

CARL

Wow. That's really big. How do

you have time for all this stuff?

RENEE

How do you have time to come to

every one of my rocks shows even

the one in Fairfield county that

was seventy-five miles from here?

I almost skipped that one.

CARL

You gave me the flier, so I had to

go.

RENEE

At first I thought you were a weird

stalker and I was scared. But now

I think you're just a really shy

dude with a crush. And while it's

been suspenseful to see when/if

you'd ask me out --

CARL

Do you want to go out sometime?

RENEE

Yes, I would.

CARL

By the way, I do other stuff

besides follow you around.

RENEE

Like what?

CARL

I take Korean.

RENEE

In that case, what do you say we do

Korean?

71.

RENEE

Do you want any more squid hot pot?

It's really good here.

CARL

I think I'm good.   To have some

more.

CARL (cont'd)

So, all this art you create.   What

do you want to do with it?

RENEE

What do you mean?

CARL

Like, do you want to open a store?

RENEE

Where I can sell my photos and

pottery? Of course not. They're

terrible.

CARL

They're not terrible.

RENEE

Yeah, they're awful.

CARL

I think you're being hard on

yourself --

RENEE

I'm not asking for sympathy. My

voice is way too high-pitched, my

pottery looks like poo, and my

photos are blurry and subjectless.

But who gives a shit? Not

everything needs a goal. The world

is a playground. You know that as

a kid but then somewhere along the

way everyone forgets.

(MORE)

72.

RENEE (cont'd)

(as if    telling a secret)

CARL

RENEE

CARL

RENEE

(THEN)

CARL

RENEE

CARL

(REALIZING)

RENEE

CARL

73.

RENEE

That actually sounds really cool.

RENEE (cont'd)

I'm stuffed. But I would love to

wrap this up.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[We are very fat. But can I please

have this food made mobile?]

RENEE

So, what do you say we hit this

crazy party?

CARL

Funny, not crazy.    My boss is white

noise.

RENEE

White noise?

CARL

You know, like totally boring.

RENEE

I don't know anyone who's totally

boring. Crack a person's shell --

there's always something creepy

underneath.

NORMAN

Carl! Welcome. Or should I say,

uerukamu!

RENEE

What's going on?

CARL

I wouldn't bother.

74.

NORMAN

You didn't tell her? This is a

dress-up as your favorite character

from Heroes. Do you watch?

RENEE

I currently don't have a

television.

NORMAN

I don't know what to do with that

information. There are drinks,

chips, dips, various and sundry

noshes. I entreat you to make

friends. Let's get this party

started!

CARL

We don't have to stay long.

RENEE

It's a party. Let's socialize.

CARL

I'm Carl.     This is Renee.

KHATOON

Hey.     I'm Khatoon.

KHATOON (cont'd)

Do I know you from somewhere?

CARL

I don't think so.

KHATOON

Are you listed on

Persianwifefinder.com?

75.

KHATOON (cont'd)

Seriously, though, are you?

CARL

So, how do you know Norman?

KHATOON

Karate Club.

NORMAN

Baked Lays people!   It is on!

CARL

You're in a karate club?

PARTY GUESTS

Norman!    Norman! Norman!

RENEE

(whispering to Carl)

Told ya there was something weird

under that white noise shell.

KHATOON

You're totally on

persianwifefinder.com.   SultanCarl.

CARL

(changing the subject)

Khatoon, Norman! You guys should

spar!

76.

JASON

Well, isn't that cute? We've got a

full match on. Hey, I'm Jason.

CARL

I'm Carl.    What do you do?

JASON

Work for the INS.

CARL

Cool.

JASON

I hate it. Everyday I have to dash

some poor guy's dream. I'm a

professional dream dasher.

CARL

It can't be that bad.

JASON

The other day, I turned down a guy

who had literally been a professor

at the University of Cuba.

CUBAN PROFESSOR

What? But I've already lived here

for five years. I've received a

steady paycheck and paid taxes for

five years. I speak fluent

English. I can't go back.

JASON

I'm sorry but no can do.

CUBAN PROFESSOR

I've passed the citizenship test

ten times. I bet you couldn't pass

that test.

JASON

You're probably right.

CUBAN PROFESSOR

Do you know the location of the

Spanish-American war?

77.

JASON

Spain?

CUBAN PROFESSOR

No.

JASON

America?

CUBAN PROFESSOR

No.

JASON

(SARCASTIC)

Spainerica?

CUBAN PROFESSOR

You are an insult to your country.

CARL

So did you let him in?

JASON

I sent him back to Cuba.       I send

them all back.

CARL

If you hate your job so much, why

do you do it?

JASON

Because I have to eat.

CARL

(to himself, in wonder)

You're a no man.

JASON

Excuse me?

CARL

(WHISPERING)

I'm not supposed to tell anyone

this except for my Yesponsor, but

you can change your life. I've

changed mine. If I tell you how,

will you promise not to tell

anyone?

78.

JASON

(sarcastically whispering

BACK)

Yeah, sure, whatever.

CARL

I say yes. To everything.    Say Yes

More. It's that simple.

JASON

That's the most retarded idea I've

ever heard.

RENEE

What did I miss?

CARL

(THROWN)

Nothing. Do you want to go?

RENEE

You work for the ASPCA?

CARL

I just love pets. This is

Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl

jr., Carl the III, Carl IV,

Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and

Cat 3. At the end there, I got

kind of bored of naming them.

CARL

You don't need to do that.

79.

RENEE

You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.

CARL

I have a congenital heart thing it

helps. And it's cheaper than the

stuff that's made here.

RENEE

You better not be a criminal.

Because one time I dated this guy

who jacked cars for a living and I

did not enjoy living on the edge as

much as I thought I would.

CARL

It's cheaper to buy in bulk.    Is

that a crime?

RENEE

A hundred boxes of Mexican

prescription drugs borders on

something vaguely criminal.

RENEE (cont'd)

Well, are you going to make out

with me or what?

CARL

Yes.

ROONEY

You must be Renee. I have heard so

much about you. Can I watch?

RENEE

No, you can't watch.

RENEE

You know what I would love?    A

massage.

80.

CARL

I give great massages.

RENEE

Oooh.   Yeah. Oooh, right there.

RENEE (cont'd)

Don't stop.

RENEE (cont'd)

Can you please keep massaging?

RENEE (cont'd)

(while asleep)

Please keep massaging, please?

CARL

How much does a Schwinn cost?

LARGE MAN

Three hundred fifty three dollars.

It'll really help me get my one

hour delivery business off the

ground. I've tried on foot. I

only have a two mile radius.

CARL

Done and done.

81.

NORMAN

Hey, the boys upstairs are here to

speak with you.

CARL

Really?   Because I have a thing at

one...

NORMAN

He asked for you specifically.

Ixnay on the small loans-ay.

CHRIS PARKER

Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker.

President of Southwest Bank.

CARL

I actually met you when I was just

a teller.

CHRIS PARKER

(no recollection of it at

ALL)

Of course!

(reading from a binder)

Pet-a-Puppy day. Free cookie day.

Free half hour on the bank's

punching bag day. You've upped

walk-in traffic by 35%. Not only

that -- you've also taken charge of

corporate day care. I like a team

player.

CARL

Thank you.

82.

CHRIS PARKER

But then I got suspicious. What

drives a man in his mid to late

thirties who's still at the

absolute lowest level of our

corporate family? Generous

helpfulness? Or raging revenge?

CARL

Generous helpfulness?

CHRIS PARKER

Which is when I got the numbers

from your loan desk.

CARL

Uh huh.

CHRIS PARKER

You've given out over 682 below

minimum loans. One of them was

literally for fifteen dollars and

eighty seven cents.

CARL

Janice Peabody's ant farm rental

business.

CHRIS PARKER

How do you explain yourself?

CARL

I've started a microloan project.

I figure that if someone needs less

than ten grand why should they go

to a loan shark when they can come

to a legitimate banking

institution?

CHRIS PARKER

Because the paperwork makes any

profit moot. Unless you're raiding

our coffers.

CARL

No.   I wouldn't do that.

CHRIS PARKER

I would if I could, so why wouldn't

you?

83.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

But then I looked closer at the

numbers. 85% of the loan

recipients have been paying them

off according to the bank's

schedule. Not just that, but 72%

of that group have returned as

regular full loan customers. This

is both a moneymaker and good for

the community. That like never

happens!

CARL

Thank you.

CHRIS PARKER

You're the kind of person we want in

corporate. We're taking some clients

on a golfing trip. You golf?

CARL

Yes.

CHRIS PARKER

You free tomorrow?

CARL

Yes.

CHRIS PARKER

Of course you are. I better watch

my back around you, Carl Kendall.

Soon you'll be taking my job. See

you on the links.

LUCY

What happened?

CARL

I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.

84.

LUCY

I've never heard of a Wedding

Shower cake.

CARL

You have to have one. Modern Bride

calls them a necessity.

CARL (cont'd)

Sorry, Luce. Work stuff.

(sotto into phone)

Yeah, I can definitely be at the

blood bank in twenty minutes.

CARL (cont'd)

Are you OK?

LUCY

I'm sorry, it's just you've been so

great at all this while my husband-

to-be has been completely absent.

Do you have time to grab a cup of

tea?

LUCY

Is he scared to get married?    Is

that why he doesn't care?

CARL

You know Peter. He's a man's man.

He cares, he just doesn't know how

to show it.

LUCY

You know how to show it. A wedding

is a huge deal. I'm so scared.

85.

CARL

You guys are perfect for each

other.

LUCY

I know that and yet I'm still so

scared.

CARL

Maybe if you're just honest with

him about how you're feeling it'll

be OK.

LUCY

He can be just so closed off.

CARL

Sorry, the bank, you know?

(sotto into phone)

The UFO conference is tonight? No,

that's fine, I'll definitely be

there.

CARL (cont'd)

I'm sorry.

LUCY

You've been so good to me. I've

really come to depend on you. I

want to pay you back.

CARL

Not necessary.

LUCY

Peter tells me you might have some

disposable income these days.

CARL

For some reason, the bank keeps

promoting me.

LUCY

If you want to look at some open

houses, I'm happy to waive my fee.

86.

LUCY

So this is at the very top end of

what you could probably afford.

Are you interested?

CARL

Yes.

LUCY

Are you sure? I mean, this is the

first place you've looked --

CARL

Yes.    I've got to run.

LUCY

I'm looking forward to meeting

Renee tonight.

CARL

What?

LUCY

We're all having dinner.    Tonight.

Remember?

CARL

Right.   Of course.

CARL

(on the phone)

I just think if we're going to be

rolling out a no interest financing

campaign we should commit hard.

87.

CARL (cont'd)

(covering the phone)

Can you unhook me? I have a really

important meeting.

NURSE

If you're interested in donating

plasma, feel free to sign up.

WEIRD PROFESSOR

Between 1996 and 2000 England's

Ministry of Defence paid security

cleared experts to research UFOs.

This classified study was code

named Project Condign.

CARL

I'm sorry I'm late.

RENEE

That's fine. It's only the very

first time I've met your friends.

CARL

It was work, it went crazy late.

RENEE

What's with the "They're Out There"

and "I Gave" button?

88.

CARL

Long story.

(to the hostess)

Miss, could I have an orange juice?

Like fast?

CARL

(showing off, to Peter)

Your wife found me a really great

place. Built in Bose surround

sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen

TV, roof deck with jacuzzi.

LUCY

Least I could do. At least he's

involved with our wedding.

PETER

(ignoring Lucy's tone)

I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss?

CARL

Oh, this old thing?   Prada, I

think.

RENEE

You think? We went to three

different Prada stores to find the

right fit.

LUCY

What do yo do for a living, Renee?

RENEE

I paint. I'm in a band. I do

volunteer work at a shelter. I

teach ESL. I do balloon animal

art. You know, a little of this, a

little of that.

CARL

You should check out her pottery.

It's really big.

89.

RENEE

It is big.     How about you guys?

LUCY

Real estate broker.

PETER/KATH/SEB

Lawyer.

PETER

If you'll excuse me.

WAITER

Have you made a decision about the

wine?

CARL

Well, we're kind of in a

celebratory mood.

WAITER

In that case, may I suggest a 97

Petit Rothschild?

CARL

Maybe we should wait for Peter to

decide.

LUCY

He doesn't know crap about wine.

Just pick one, Carl.

CARL

Why not?   Let's celebrate.

WAITER

With six people, I'd recommend two

bottles.

90.

LUCY

Do you rent or own?

RENEE

I sublet.    I have this corner of a

loft.

CARL

It's a really nice corner though.

LUCY

If you're ever interested in

buying, you should ring me up.

RENEE

I hate owning things. Because when

you own something, you suddenly are

invested in that thing not

breaking. And I break everything.

I've gone through three TVS in

three years.

SEB

How did you break them?

RENEE

I smashed one with a hammer,

dropped one off my roof and the

third one just went on the fritz.

So I set it on fire.

CARL

It's on me!

(quietly to the waiter)

I'd like to split it between an

Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard,

a Diners Club and my South Dakota

Bank Visa Check card.

PETER

Nice job with Renee. She's

definitely odd, but that's not

necessarily --

91.

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

CARL

PETER

(opening up)

92.

CARL

What?   Why?

PETER

It's marriage, you know?   The

biggest thing ever.

CARL

But you guys have dated for years.

PETER

I know.

CARL

You're perfect for each other.

PETER

I know.

CARL

She's terrified too.

PETER

Really?

CARL

Of course she is. I think you'll

both be a lot less terrified if

you're terrified together.

PETER

But what if I really can't tell the

difference between ivory and cream?

Does that make me a bad husband?

CARL

What matters is that you pretend

you can see the difference.

GIRLS

(high pitched goodbyes)

It was wonderful meeting you!/I

loved it!/Let me know when you

throw your next art thing!

RENEE

It was great meeting your friends.

93.

CARL

They're a little stiff.

RENEE

They are a little stiff.   What do

you feel like doing?

CARL

I'm actually going rollerblading

with Ralph.

RENEE

Ralph?

CARL

You know, crazy rollerblading

guitar man.

RENEE

The guy who plays at the promenade?

CARL

Any interest?

RENEE

No. It's ten on a Friday night.

And that guy's crazy. Don't you

want to go home and make out?

CARL

Yes.

RENEE

(ANNOYED)

Just go.

94.

CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN

Which is why the merman is not to

be trusted, especially with the

fisherman's computer brain.

CARL

That is really good to know.

CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN

You want to come see the merman?

CARL

(RELUCTANT)

Yes.

CHRIS PARKER

What happened to you?

CARL

I do this whole Habitat for

Humanity Thing.

CHRIS PARKER

I love the concept of charity.

It's awesome.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

This is Carl Kendall. This is Jin

Kim, Joo-Chan Park, Soo Lee and

Seung Kim. Seung's the CEO of

Korean Bank International.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[It is an honor to meet you.   Do

you like America?]

95.

CHRIS PARKER

You speak Korean?

CARL

Just a little.

CHRIS PARKER

You sneaky devil. I knew I should

watch my back around you.

CARL

Is it a problem if I've never

played golf before?

CHRIS PARKER

You're a funny one, Carl Kendall.

Remember, they have to win. In

Asian cultures, there's a concept

called Saving Face. You have to

let them win. But if they smell

for a second that you haven't tried

your hardest, they'll commit hari

kari.

CARL

Metaphorically?

CHRIS PARKER

Who knows? It's a delicate

balance, Kendall. Like two little

girls on a see saw with a crocodile

beneath them. Make the wrong move,

and the little girl will end up in

the croc's maw.

96.

CHRIS PARKER

Alright, buddy. It's all you.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

You must have quite a powerful

stroke.

CARL

I do.

SEUNG KIM

(in Korean, to Carl)

[Good luck, my friend.]

CARL

(in Korean)

[I shall need the luck.    This is my

first time playing.]

CARL (cont'd)

(under his breath)

Why does everyone think I'm joking?

CARL (cont'd)

That's really far.

CARL (cont'd)

(in Korean, to Seung Kim)

[You're up, Seung Kim.]

CHRIS PARKER

What was that?

CARL

Just keeping them on their toes.

Reverse psychology. Tiger Woods

does it.

97.

CARL (cont'd)

Of course not.

CARL (cont'd)

Male.

(BEAT)

Apartment.

(BEAT)

I prefer light beer.

(BEAT)

Three to five times a week.

(BEAT)

Orlando.

98.

CARL

Chris, you hit a 90.   Nice one.

CHRIS PARKER

I bogied the fifth hole.   I'm still

pissed about that.

CARL

Joo-Chan hit a 95. Nice work.      As

for Seung Kim. You hit 453.

CARL (cont'd)

And as for me, I hit...

(doing some computations)

... 503.

SEUNG KIM

Yes!

CARL

I'm sorry to say that team Korean

Bank International has won.

PRETTY KOREAN BANKER

(in Korean)

[You are quite the golfer.]

CARL

(in Korean)

[I golf from crotch noodle.]

PRETTY KOREAN BANKER

(in Korean)

[I have a business proposition for

you. My marriage is not a happy

one. I often find my needs are

left unsatisfied.]

99.

CARL

(in Korean)

[I agree. The weather is sunny.]

PRETTY KOREAN BANKER

(in Korean)

[I wish that was so.]

(in English)

Kiss me? Please?

CARL

(NERVOUSLY)

Yes.

PRETTY KOREAN BANKER

Am I not sexy? Have you not heard

of saving face?

CARL

You're very sexy.

CHRIS PARKER

I'm promoting you to bank manager.

(pulling Carl close)

I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't

you forget it.

RENEE

What's up, chicken butt?

(off his guilty look)

(MORE)

100.

RENEE (cont'd)

Are you OK? Did everything go OK

at golf?

CARL

I just got promoted to bank

manager.

RENEE

Congratulations!

RENEE (cont'd)

Oooh, we should do some sexy

pottery. Like you can rub the clay

all over me.

CARL

OK.

RENEE

I was kidding. Not as sexy as it

seems. It gets in like everywhere.

(awkward beat)

What should we do to celebrate?

CARL

Have dinner?

RENEE

How about Korean? Oh, no, you

probably already had some today.

CARL

(NERVOUSLY)

No, we just had American food,

American fare.

RENEE

You've just been so busy -- it'd be

fun to have a night just the two of

us. I wish we could just go to the

airport and hop on the first flight

outta here.

CARL

Yes.

101.

RENEE

(with an English accent)

I think we're going to London.

CARL

(with a Spanish accent)

Oaxaca, senorita.

RENEE

(with a Russian accent)

Moscow, Russia, comrade.

CARL

(with an unidentifiable

ACCENT)

Singapore.

RENEE

What was that?

CARL

My Singaporean accent.     Pretty

good, right?

CARL (cont'd)

(PROUDLY)

We want two tickets on the next

plane out of here.

AIRLINE REP

Two tickets to... Lincoln,

Nebraska.   Have a good time.

CARL

(acting positive)

Lincoln, Nebraska! Here we come,

baby!

AIRLINE REP

That'll be twelve hundred and

thirty three dollars.

RENEE

Maybe we shouldn't do this.

102.

CARL

I've been promoted.     I've got money

to burn.

TONY

Do you want to change your life

through Mahayana Buddhism?

TONY (cont'd)

Carl?

CARL

Tony.

TONY

How've you been?     You... never

called.

CARL

I'm sorry.     I've been busy.

TONY

Yeah, well, I've been busy too.

RENEE

Hey, who's your friend?

RENEE (cont'd)

I'm Renee.

TONY

I'm Tony. I'm an old, close friend

of Carl's.

103.

ANNOUNCER

Flight 2036 to Lincoln, Nebraska,

now boarding.

CARL

That's our flight. We should

probably get going.

RENEE

It was nice meeting you.

CARL

See you soon.

TONY

(dripping with bitterness)

Have fun. You abigail.

YOUNG WOMAN

Hi, there. Would you mind

switching places with me? I want

to be across the aisle from my mom.

RENEE

We're actually flying together.

YOUNG WOMAN

It would really mean a great deal.

She's very scared of flying.

CARL

Where's your seat?

CARL (cont'd)

This is an aisle. That's a middle.

104.

MOM

I'm really scared of flying.

RENEE

So, now that we're here, what

should we do?

CARL

Well, clearly we should go there.

CARL

I had no idea that the earliest

switchboard operator headsets

weighed ten and a half pounds.

That is fascinating.

RENEE

It is?

CARL

Not at all.

ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE

(in character)

I'll connect you to the coast in an

instant with Alexander Graham

Bell's brand new invention -- the

telephone! Just a haypenny per ten

minutes.

(out of character)

(MORE)

105.

ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd)

This place is boring as shit.

Check out the Lester F. Larsen

Tractor Test & Power Museum. Now

that's an attraction. Ask for

Billy.

RENEE

We don't have to do this.

CARL

We're here. We might as well.

CARL

THIS IS AWESOME!

TRACTOR DRIVER

WANT ME TO OPEN THIS SUCKER UP?

CARL/RENEE

YES!

TRACTOR DRIVER

TAKE THE WHEEL! FEEL THE POWER OF

JOHN DEERE!

CARL

There's, uhh, no power steering.

TRACTOR DRIVER

It's a tractor, not a Toyota.

CARL

I'm sorry about the barn.

106.

TRACTOR DRIVER

Been meaning to tear this sucker

down anyway.

RENEE

I think I might have whiplash from

that tractor ride.

CARL

Just don't sue me.

RENEE

Watch your back, Carl.   I mean it.

I'm very litigious.

CARL

This day has been so randomly

incredible.

RENEE

Would you... want to... travel

around the world with me?

(THEN)

I mean, I know we haven't really

been seeing each other for that

long, but I don't know...

CARL

Yes.

RENEE

Yes?

CARL

Definitely.

RENEE

I think I'm falling, you know...

Are you... ?

CARL

Yes.

RENEE

Before our flight, what do you say

we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks?

107.

CARL

I'm definitely falling for you.

OLD WOMAN

Excuse me. Would you mind bringing

this to my son?

CARL

Like you want me to bring it with

me? On the plane?

OLD WOMAN

Fedex is so expensive and this

needs to get to him today.

CARL

(very nervous)

Yeah. Sure. I'd be happy to.

OLD WOMAN

He's a tall, blond fellow named

Sheldon Winkleton. He'll be

holding a sign in the terminal with

his name on it. You are a dear.

RENEE

I got US Weekly, Star and, for a

little culture, the National

Enquirer.

CARL

National Enquirer?

RENEE

They have movie reviews.    What's in

the package?

CARL

Just a gift for some buddies back

home.

108.

RENEE

I'm sorry, I have to go to the

bathroom.

DEA AGENT

Put the package down!    Put it down!

DEA AGENT (cont'd)

Get on the ground! Both of you!

RENEE

What the hell is that?

CARL

I don't know!

109.

GOOD COP BOB

I'm Bob.

BAD COP BOB

And I'm Bob.

BAD COP BOB (cont'd)

Do you find that funny?

CARL

Yes. I'm sorry. Just let the girl

go. She doesn't know anything.

BAD COP BOB

We'll see about that, Carl.

CARL

Some old lady gave me a package in

the Lincoln airport to deliver to

her son, Sheldon Winkleton. That

was really stupid of me and I

realize that now. I don't know

anything about anything.

GOOD COP BOB

Just answer a few questions and I'm

sure we'll get this all sorted out.

Have you ever used illegal drugs?

CARL

Yes.

GOOD COP BOB

Pot?

CARL

Yes.   But that's all.

BAD COP BOB

How about shrooms?

110.

CARL

But that's the only bad shit I've

done. I swear.

BAD COP BOB

Never cheated on a girlfriend?

CARL

(WEEPING)

Yes, I have. But I was in high

school. I was a mess. She had

cheated on me --

BAD COP BOB

You disgust me.

GOOD COP BOB

He's a moron. But I think he's

telling the truth.

BAD COP BOB

I agree. No one ever admits to the

cheating question.

RENEE

What the hell happened?

CARL

I can explain.

RENEE

So explain. Are you a drug

smuggler?

111.

CARL

Look, when the nice lady asked me

to take them on the plane, I

thought they were chocolates.

RENEE

You expect me to believe a nice

lady asked you to bring chocolates

on a plane?

CARL

I know how it sounds.

RENEE

I don't think you do.

RENEE (cont'd)

If you can't be honest with me,

then you and the nice lady can have

a fun life in Candyland.

CARL

Wait!     I'll explain better.

RENEE

So you've just been saying yes to

everything.

CARL

Yes.

(THEN)

Pardon the pun.

RENEE

Oh.

CARL

See? Do you get it now? It's

nothing, just a glitch really.

112.

RENEE

I thought we had so much in common

but if you just yes to everything I

don't know that we do. How do I

know if you even like Korean food?

CARL

I don't.

RENEE

Do you even want to travel around

the world at all or do you want to

work at that bank and buy a lot of

Prada suits?

CARL

(CONFUSED)

Yes. And yes.

RENEE

When I asked if you were falling

for me all you said was yes.

CARL

It wasn't a lie.

RENEE

Yes.    It was.

NURSE

It'll be over soon.

CARL

I don't care. Just take it all.

113.

SECRETARY

Chris will be with you in a moment.

Would you like something to drink?

CHRIS PARKER

So I got a call from the police

department.

CARL

I'm not a drug dealer --

CHRIS PARKER

I spent a couple years in prison

myself. So I backdated some stock

options. Excuse me for trying to

help our bottom line, right?

CARL

You got to do what you got to do to

help Mr. And Mrs. Shareholder.

CHRIS PARKER

We are their slaves.

CARL

Totally.

CHRIS PARKER

Honestly, I prefer for all my top

guys to have been in the Big House.

We've all eaten the slop. There's

a trust there you can't break.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

So, what do you say to being a VP

and expanding your microloan

program bankwide?

CARL

(SURPRISED)

Yes.

114.

CARL

(on the phone)

That's right, we're dropping the

minimum loan to one dollar, bank-

wide.

CHRIS PARKER

Could you look through these

numbers and let me know which of

our five branches have been lagging

behind in profit?

CARL

I thought I was just implementing

the microloan program.

CHRIS PARKER

You're a VP, buddy. You do it all

now.

CARL

Sorry about that.

CHRIS PARKER

Carl, I'm glad you could join us.

So, to keep you all updated, we

should be merging with Korean Bank

International within the year.

115.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

As per our argument with KBI, we'll

be shoring up our bottom line.

Carl Kendall's done us the honor of

drawing up a preliminary list of

the branches that are on the

chopping block. Nice work, Carl.

CARL

You can't close the Maple Branch!

CHRIS PARKER

I know that Maple's where you got

your start, but if I don't lay

those people off then I get laid

off. It's a vicious cycle.

CARL

You don't have to if you don't want

to.

CHRIS PARKER

(deadly serious)

If we don't close these branches

than KBI will buy our competitor

instead of us and put us all out of

business. If you want to be an

executive and get to do fun stuff

like your microloan project, then

you also have to be the bad guy who

lays people off. That's why we get

paid the big bucks. To make the

hard decisions.

NORMAN

The bank's all I've got. Every

morning I restock the hard candy,

polish the safe, write today's

interest rates on the board.

116.

CARL

There are other banks.

ROONEY

We have to protest the merger.   Get

some grassroots action going.

Grass looks weak, but it grows

everywhere.

CARL

You don't even work at the bank.

NORMAN

You should protest with us!

ROONEY

Yeah! Protest with your employees!

It will only make you more popular!

EMPLOYEES

Hell no! We won't go!    Hell no!

We won't go!

ROONEY

Throw a rock at him.

NORMAN

Yeah, throw a rock!

117.

CHRIS PARKER

Some asshole protestor threw a rock

at my head.

CARL

Those dicks.

CHRIS PARKER

I wish using hoses wasn't such bad

PR.

CARL

I think I made a mistake letting

Renee go like that. What if I'm

supposed to go on that trip?

PETER

You own an apartment because of

that job. People don't generally

leave good jobs.

CARL

But the bank doesn't feel right...

PETER

Hey, honey. I think we should go

with the tulips. I know roses are

more romantic, but they're also

much more cliched. Babe, can you

wait a second?

(covering the phone)

I'm going to be on for a while.

Ask your guru. He's the one who

sent you on this retarded quest in

the first place.

118.

CARL

Hi, Sanji.     I'm Carl.   Kendall.

SANJI

(no memory of Carl)

Of course! Would you like to

purchase my new book, "The Power of

Yes: Life is Yessy"?

CARL

Actually, I had a question for

you...

SANJI

Well, this line is for book

customers only.

CARL

I'm sorry to bother you again --

SANJI

Can't you see that I'm eating?

CARL

I have a really important question.

I have to choose between traveling

around the world with a girl I'm

really into or choosing a job that

will make me pretty well off. I

don't know which yes to take.

SANJI

How well off?

CARL

I don't know why that's important.

SANJI

I should know all the data.

CARL

A lot, OK?

119.

SANJI

This is    what I recommend. Every

winter,    I throw a two week long

seminar    in Aspen. It's only ten

grand a    week and it will open your

mind up    --

CARL

I don't want to go to a seminar. I

just need help with this question.

SANJI

For you, eight grand a week. I

have helped celebrities like Cher

and Jack Welch. You will love it --

CARL

(REALIZING)

You're a total con artist.

SANJI

I am not a con artist. Have I not

set you on the life path you

desire?

CARL

(PANICKING)

I've put my life into the hands of

a con artist! And because of you I

have this retarded yes branded on

my hand for life!

(yelling to the

RESTAURANT)

This man is a con artist! Don't

listen to this man! He is a con

artist!

ROONEY

(into the headset)

You are dead, AnalDestroyer832!

CARL

Out!

120.

ROONEY

What?   Why?

CARL

You've slept on my couch for four

weeks. You're a grown man. Now

sack up and get the hell out of

here.

ROONEY

Will you let me stay here please?

CARL

Are you deaf?

ROONEY

You have to say yes if I ask you.

CARL

You knew?

ROONEY

I may not seem like I get it, but I

get everything. Lucy and Kath?

Made out one time in the bathroom

at Rudy's.

CARL

Get the hell out of here.

NIGERIAN KING (V.O.)

Dear Carl, It is vitally important

you send me your bank account

information. The government will

be closing in on my account in the

very near future. Your good

friend, Omar, Former King of

Nigeria.

121.

CARL (V.O.)

Omar, Let's cut the crap. You are

not a king. You're probably just a

teenage con artist jerking off

somewhere in Russia. Write me

again and I will find you and beat

your stupid lying face in. Dick.

Sincerely, Carl Kendall.

FLIER GUY

You want to pawn --

CARL

No.

DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER

Would you like an --

CARL

No.

122.

CARL

Hey, Luce. What're you doing all

the way over here?

LUCY

It's been hard to reach you.

CARL

I've been a little swamped.

LUCY

Everything OK?

CARL

Yeah.   Things are great.

LUCY

I was wondering when you want to

meet with the florist.

CARL

Sorry, but I'm too busy these days.

Don't have time to help with the

party anymore. Good luck.

LUCY

You're just stopping, just like

that?

CARL

I'm not the one marrying you.

Maybe you should ask him for some

help.

LUCY

He is helping. Here I was thinking

we were actual friends.

123.

CHRIS PARKER

(with great importance)

What is the best way for us to

enter the teenage credit card

market?

VP

Give away a free iPod.

CHRIS PARKER

Yes.

ANOTHER VP

Include one with cans of Mountain

Dew Code Red.

CHRIS PARKER

Nice.   Anyone else? Carl?

CARL

Have you guys thought that

teenagers don't have the financial

knowhow to use a credit card?

CHRIS PARKER

That's why they're such a ripe

market. Any ideas on how to pick

that low hanging fruit?

CARL

Include a Mastercard with every

xBox.

CHRIS PARKER

I like that. I like that a lot.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

Now remember, tomorrow's our

official merger ceremony with KBI.

So wear your nice suits. I'm

talking to you, Feldman.

124.

PETER (V.O.)

(over the answering

MACHINE)

Hey, Carl. Peter here. Long time

no see. Sorry to hear you won't be

planning our engagement party.

Although I guess that makes you

less gay than I thought you were.

We'll be watching the game at

Rudy's tonight, if you're

interested.

JASON (V.O.)

Dear Carl. I know this is kind of

random, but I thought I should

write you. We met at that party at

Norman's apartment. I was the INS

guy who hated his life and hated

you. I just wanted to tell you

that I took your advice. I quit my

job and have founded a home in

Botswana for elderly orangutans.

I've never been happier. You told

me to say "yes" and it has turned

out to be incredible. Thank you.

Yours truly, Jason Newmark

CARL'S SECRETARY

The executives are gathering in the

conference room to officially greet

the KBI Officials.

(MORE)

125.

CARL'S SECRETARY (cont'd)

(re: the post card)

Cute gorilla.

CARL

It's an elderly orangutan actually.

(handing her the list)

Could you please call everyone on

this list and tell them to show up

at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening

at 9PM?

CARL'S SECRETARY

Will do.

CARL

I just want to say, it was really

great having you as my first

secretary.

CARL'S SECRETARY

You're not firing me, are you?

CARL

I don't think I'm going to be

working here much longer.

CARL

I need to talk to you.

CHRIS PARKER

And I need to talk to you. You

mind doing a little ceremonial

translating?

CARL

I don't know if I'm good enough at

Korean --

CHRIS PARKER

Believe in yourself and the world

believes in you.

126.

CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)

I'd like to welcome our new

partners into the Southwest family.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[Welcome. You will be my partner.]

SEUNG KIM

(in Korean)

[Thank you.]

CHRIS PARKER

KBI is the at the forefront of the

financial world. With your help,

Southwest will be as well.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[He says that you are a son of a

dog and like to have the dirty

sex.]

SEUNG KIM

(in Korean)

[What?]

CHRIS PARKER

We look forward to working together

and extending our reach across the

globe.

CARL

(in Korean, with

SUBTITLES)

[He says in Korea you poop on the

ground and that here you cannot

poop on the ground.]

SEUNG KIM

(in Korean)

[That is factually inaccurate]

CARL

(in Korean)

[I know. But it's what the bigot

believes.]

127.

CHRIS PARKER

So with this hand shake, I make

official the acquisition of

Southwest by Korean Bank

International.

CARL

(in Korean)

[Although you have poop on your

hand, I am willing to shake it so I

can steal all your money, you

stupid Korean.]

SEUNG KIM

No.

CHRIS PARKER

Excuse me?

SEUNG KIM

(perfect English with a

British accent)

We have a traitor in our midst.

This man just called me a son of a

dog and informed me that my hand is

covered in fecal matter. He is

clearly trying to sabotage the

merger.

CARL

You speak English?

SEUNG KIM

You think an international bank

financier wouldn't speak fluent

English? For whom do you work,

traitor? Shanghai Bank?

Chinatrust?

CARL

For myself.

SEUNG KIM

Fine. Keep it secret.

Unfortunately, I cannot approve a

merger with a company so

incompetent as to have a business

saboteur this high up. Good day.

128.

CARL

I quit.

PETER

Why does he want us here?

LUCY

I have no idea.

KATH

(to Lucy)

You guys get the call as well?

IRANIAN WOMAN

I'm Farinoush.

ROONEY

I'm Rooney.

IRANIAN WOMAN

You're tall.

CARL

(over the loudspeakers)

Announcing the pending marriage of

Peter Carlton and Lucy Giuliano!

CARL (cont'd)

Congratulations on your engagement!

129.

PETER

Wow.    There's a horse in here.

LUCY

Who are all these people?

CARL

I didn't have much time to throw

this together. I got a stallion,

didn't I?

LUCY

Thanks, Carl.

PETER

What're you doing out here?

CARL

I entrust you to sell all my shit.

PETER

What're you talking about?

PETER (cont'd)

Say hello to her when you see her.

Where is she by the way?

130.

RENEE

What're you doing here?

CARL

Yes.

RENEE

I didn't ask you a question.

CARL

Well, if you do that's what my

answer will be.

RENEE

Are you here because you want to be

here?

CARL

I just flew twenty-two hours. What

do you think? Now can I please

kiss you?

YOUNG THAI MAN

(in Thai, with subtitles)

[I need ten thousand bhat to get my

first tuk tuk. If I get a tuk tuk

I no longer have to mop the ping

pong show floor and clean the

snake.]

CARL

(in Thai, with subtitles)

[What snake?]

YOUNG THAI MAN

(in Thai, with subtitles)

[You don't want to know.]

131.

NORMAN

(in Thai, with subtitles)

[You guys don't have Heroes? I

don't know you, but I think you

would love it.]

OLD THAI MAN

(in Thai, with subtitles)

[If I like it will you give me

money to fix my fishing boat?]

MACHINE GUN GUARD

What do you want?

CARL

I'm here to see Omar.   The former

King of Nigeria.

OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA

Is that Carl Kendall?

CARL

Omar! It's wonderful to meet you

in person

OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA

And this must be Renee? What a

delight!

RENEE

Thank you, your majesty.

OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA

Please, call me Omar.

132.

CARL

I'm sorry for calling you a

masturbatory Russian teenager.

OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA

Water under the bridge. What do

you say to having a feast?

THE END
