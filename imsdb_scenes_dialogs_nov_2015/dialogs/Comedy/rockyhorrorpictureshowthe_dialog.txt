To the late night double feature

RALPH

Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!

BRAD

Well I don't think there was any doubt

about that - You and Betty have been

almost inseparable ever since you sat

in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

RALPH

Tell you the truth Brad, she was the

only reason I came in the first place.

Science was never one of my favourite

subjects but I sure with Dr Scott

could have made it today.

BRAD

Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.

We drove over to see him last vacation.

It's a shame his new job took him away

from Denton.

RALPH

Hey fella.  It looks like it could be

your turn next.

BRAD

Who knows...ha ha.

JANET (who is holding the bouquet)

Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't

Betty look radiantly beautiful.

Just an hour ago she was plain old

Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs.

Ralph Hapschatt.

BRAD (Still looking after the car)

Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a

lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)

JANET

Yes.

BRAD

Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful

little cook.

JANET

Yes.

BRAD

And Ralph himself will be in line for

promotion in a year or so.

JANET

Yes.

16	EXT.	CHURCH	DAY

BRAD (spoken)

Hey Janet.

JANET

Yes Brad.

BRAD

I've got something to say.

JANET

Uh huh.

BRAD

I really loved the skilful way

You beat the other girls

To the bride's bouquet.

JANET

Oh Brad.

BRAD

The river was deep but I swam it.

BRAD

The future is ours so let's plan it.

The road was long but I ran it.

FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)

Janet.

BRAD (Climbing onto fence)

There's a fire in my heart

And you fan it.  (Jumps off)

FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)

Janet.

BRAD

If there's one fool for you

Then I am it.

FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)

Janet.

BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)

I've one thing to say and that's,

Dammit, Janet.

BRAD

I love you.

BRAD

Here's a ring to prove that

I'm not joker.

BRAD

There's three ways that love can grow.

That's good bad or mediocre.

BRAD

Oh - J - A - N - E - T

I love you so.

BRAD

Oh Dammit.

JANET (Caresses his cheek)

I'm mad.....

BRAD

Oh Janet

JANET

18	INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT

NARRATOR

I would like if I may to take you on a

strange journey.

NARRATOR

It seemed a fairly ordinary night when

Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss

(two young ordinary healthy kids) left

Denton that late November evening to

visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and

now friend of both of them.  It's true

there were dark storm clouds, heavy,

black and pendulous, toward which they

were driving.  It's true also that the

spare tyre they were carrying was badly

in need of some air.  But they being

normal kids and on a night out, well

they were not going to let a storm

spoil the events of their evening.

On a night out.

NARRATOR

It was a night out they were going to

remember for a very long time.

WIPE TO

19	EXT.	NIGHT

JANET

Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist

that's passed us.  They certainly take

their lives in their hands.  What with

the weather and all.

BRAD

Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to

that type.

JANET

What's the matter Brad, darling?

BRAD

I think we took the wrong fork a few

miles back.

JANET

Oh dear!  But then where did the

motorcyclists come from?

BRAD

Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have

to turn back.

CUT TO

20	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT

23	INT.	CAR	NIGHT

BRAD

You'd better sit here and keep warm

while I go for help.

JANET

But where will you go?  We're in the

middle of nowhere.

BRAD

Didn't we pass a castle back down the

road a few miles?  Maybe they have

a telephone I might use.

JANET

I'm coming with you.

BRAD

There's no point both of us getting wet.

JANET

I'm coming with you.

(she unbuckles her seatbelt)

Besides, darling, the owner of the phone

might be a beautiful woman and you may

never come back.

CUT TO

24	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT

JANET

In the velvet darkness

Of the blackest night

Burning bright.

JANET

There's a guiding star

No matter what or who you are.

BRAD & JANET

There's a light

PHANTOM VOICES

Over at the Frankenstein place.

BRAD

There's a light.

PHANTOM VOICES

Burning in the fireplace.

JANET

(looks to Brad)

There's a light, a light

In the darkness of everybody's life

BRAD

I can see the flag fly

I can see the rain

Just the same

There has got to be

Something better here

For you and me.

And so it seemed that fortune had smiled

on Brad and Janet and that they had found

the assistance that their plight required -

or had they?

WIPE TO

35	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF THE CASTLE	NIGHT

JANET

Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold

and I'm frightened.

BRAD

Just a moment, Janet.  They may have

a telephone.

RIFF RAFF

Hello.

BRAD

Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.

And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -

ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our

car has broken down about two miles up the

road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

RIFF RAFF

You're wet.

JANET

Yes, the rain has been very heavy.

BRAD

Yes.

RIFF RAFF

Yes.

37	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF CASTLE	NIGHT

RIFF RAFF

JANET

You're too kind.

DISSOLVE

38	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT

JANET

(sotto voce)

Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind

of place is this?

BRAD

(sotto voce)

Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting

lodge for rich weirdos.

CUT TO

39	INT.	HALLWAY	NIGHT

RIFF RAFF

This way.

JANET

Are you - giving a party?

RIFF RAFF

No.  You've arrived on a rather special

night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

JANET

Oh, lucky him.

MAGENTA

He's lucky.

MAGENTA

You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all

lucky.

40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP"

RIFF RAFF

It's astounding

Time is fleeting

Madness takes its toll

But listen closely

Not for very much longer

I've got to keep control.

RIFF RAFF

I remember doing the Time Warp.

RIFF RAFF

Drinking those moments when

The blackness would hit me.

RIFF RAFF

And the void would be calling.

46	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT

MAGENTA

It's so dreamy

Oh, fantasy free me

So you can't see me

No not at all.

In another dimension.

(she forces them back towards

balcony)

With voyeuristic intention.

Well secluded I see all

With a bit of a mind flip

You're into the time slip

Nothing will ever seem the same.

You're spaced out on sensation.

Like you're under sedation.

GUESTS

Let's do the Time Warp again.

GUESTS

Let's do the Time Warp again.

CUT TO

47	INT.	BANDSTAND	NIGHT

COLUMBIA

Well I was walking down the street

Just having a think

When a snake of a guy

Gave me an evil wink.

Well it shook me up

It took me by surprise

He had a pick-up truck

And the devil's eyes

He stared at me

And I felt a change

Time meant nothing

Never would again.

JANET

Brad, please lets get out of here.

BRAD

For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

JANET

But it seems so unhealthy here.

BRAD

It's just a..a party Janet.

JANET

Well I want to leave.

BRAD

We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.

JANET

Then ask the butler - or someone.

BRAD

Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want

to interfere with their celebrations.

JANET

This isn't the Junior Chamber of

Commerce Brad.

BRAD

They're probably foreigners with ways

different from our own.  -  They may

do some more folk dancing.

JANET

Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.

BRAD

I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.

He's a little brought down -

Because when you knocked

He thought you were the candyman.

54A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

FRANK

Don't get strung out by the way

that I look.

FRANK

Don't judge a book by its cover

I'm not much of a man

By the light of day

But by night I'm one hell of a lover.

FRANK

I'm just a sweet Transvestite

From Transexual Transylvania.

Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound

You look like you're both pretty groovie.

Or if you want something visual

not too abysmal

We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

BRAD

I'm glad we caught you at home

Ah - could we use your phone

We're both in a bit of a hurry.

JANET

Right!

BRAD

We'll just say where we are

Then go back to the car

We don't want to be any worry.

FRANK

You got caught with a flat

Well how about that

Well babies don't you panic

By the light of the night

It'll seem alright

I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

FRANK

I'm just a sweet transvestite

From Transexual Transylvania.

FRANK

Why dont'cha stay for the night

RIFF & MAGENTA

"night"

Or maybe a bite

RIFF & MAGENTA

"bite"

I could show you my favourite obsession

I've been making a man

With blonde hair and a tan

And he's good for relieving my tension.

FRANK

I'm just a sweet transvestite

From Transexual Transylvania.

I'm just a sweet transvestite.

BRAD

(confidentially)

It's alright Janet, we'll play along

for now and pull out the aces when the

time is right.

BRAD

Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and

this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You

are ...

COLUMBIA

You are very lucky to be invited up

to Frank's laboratory.  Some people

would give their right arm for the

privilege.

BRAD

People like you maybe

COLUMBIA

I've seen it.

JANET

(to Magenta)

It he - Frank - is he your husband?

RIFF RAFF

The Master is not yet married.  Nor

do I think he ever will be.  We are

simply his servants.

JANET

Oh.

CUT TO

69	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

FRANK

Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.

FRANK

I will entertain...ah...

BRAD

I'm Brad Majors and this

is my fiancee, Janet Vice.

JANET

Weiss.

BRAD

Weiss.

FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss)

Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)

And what charming underclothes you both have.

(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff

and hands them to Brad).

But here, put these on.  They'll

make you feel less vulnerable.

FRANK (continues)

It's not often we receive visitors here.

Let alone offer them hospitality.

BRAD (Moving towards Frank)

Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was

use your telephone.  A reasonable request

which you have chosen to ignore.

JANET (Hurring after Brad)

Don't be ungrateful Brad.

BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)

Ungrateful!

FRANK

How forceful you are Brad.  Such a

perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.

You must be awfully proud of him Janet.

JANET

Well, yes I am.

FRANK

Do you have any tattoos Brad.

BRAD

Certainly not!

FRANK

Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

RIFF RAFF

Everything is in readiness, Master.

We merely await your word.

FRANK

Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear

me at the back?

Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.

FRANK

Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough

in biochemical research.

FRANK

And paradise is to be mine.

FRANK

It was strange the way it happened.

One of those quirks of fate really.

One of those moments when you seem

irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're

trapped; your back's against the wall.

There's no way out, and then suddenly,

you get a break.  (He cracks the bones

in his hand)  All the pieces seem to

fit into place.  What a sucker you'r

been. What a fool.  The answer was there

all the time.  It took a small accident

to make it happen.  An accident!

MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)

An accident.

FRANK

That's how I discovered the secret.

That elusive ingredient, that spark

that is the breath of life.

FRANK (Moving to tank)

You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.

For tonight is the night that my beautiful

creature is destined to be born.

Someone's going to be

Cutting the thread.

Oh, woe is me.

My life is a misery.

Oh, can't you see

That I'm at the start

Of a pretty big downer....

ROCKY

I woke up this morning

With a start

When I fell out of bed.

GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)

That ain't no crime.

ROCKY

And left from my dreaming

Was a feeling

Of un-nameable dread.

GUESTS

That ain't no crime

ROCKY

My high is low.

I'm dressed up

With no place to go.

And all I know

FRANK

Well.  That's no way to

behave on your first day out.

But as you're such an

exceptional beauty I'm

prepared to forgive.

I just love success.

RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank)

He is a credit to your

genius, Master.

FRANK

Yes.

MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls)

A triumph of your vill.

FRANK

Yes.

COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank)

He's o.k.

FRANK

O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards

Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a

little better than that.

You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?

JANET

Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't

like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

FRANK

I didn't make him for you

He carries the Charles Atlas seal of

approval....And he didn't even take

the lessons.

74A	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

FRANK

A weakling weighing

Ninety eight pounds

Will get sand in his face

When kicked to the ground.

And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)

With a determined chin

The sweat from his pores

As he works for his ca-ha-hause

FRANK

Will make him glisten - thank you -

And gleam.

And with massage

And just a little bit of

Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)

He'll be pink.

And quite clean.

FRANK

He'll be a strong man -

Oh honey -

GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.

But the wrong man.

FRANK

He'll eat nutritious high protein

And swallow raw eggs.

Try to build up his shoulders,

His chest, arms and legs.

Such an effort -

If he only knew of my plan.

In just seven days,

GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK

I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an

FRANK

He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,

Do the snatch, clean and jerk.

He thinks dynamic tension

Must be hard work.

Such strenuous living

I just don't understand.

When, in just seven days -

Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)

I can make you

A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).

EDDIE

Whatever happened to Saturday night

When you dressed up sharp

And you felt alright

It don't seem the same since cosmic light

Came into my life and I thought I was divine.

I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go

And listen to the music on the radio.

A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show

And we climbed in the back

And we really had a good time

ALL

Hot patootie

Bless my soul

I really love that rock and roll

(four times)

EDDIE

My head used to swim

From the perfume I smelled.

My hands kind of fumbled

With her white plastic belt.

I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,

And that's when I'd melt.

And she'd whisper in my ear,

Tonight she really was mine.

Get back in front and put

Some hair oil on.

Buddy Holly was singing

His very last song.

With your arms around your girl

You tried to - ah - sing along

It felt pretty good, whoo.

Really had a good ti-i-ime.

There are some people who say that life

is an illusion, and that reality is simply

a figment of our imaginations!  If this

is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.

However, the sudden departure of their

host and his creation (into the seclusion

of his sombre bridal suite) had left them

feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.

A feeling which grew as the other guests

'departed' and 'they' were shown to their

separate rooms.

Get a hit and your mind goes ping

Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.

So let the part and the sounds rock on

Gonna shake it till the life has gone.

Rose tint my world

Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

Frank N. Furter

It's all over

Your mission is a failure.

Your life style's too extreme.

I'm your new Commander.

You are now my prisoner.

We return to Transylvania

Prepare the transit beam.

FRANK

Wait!  I can explain.

Oh my, my,

FRANK

I've seen blue skies

Through the tears in my eyes

And I realise

I'm going home

I'm going home

Everywhere it's been the same

MAGENTA

How sentimental.

RIFF RAFF

And also presumptuous of you.  You

see when I said "we" were to return

to Transylvania, I referred only to

Magenta and myself.

RIFF RAFF

You see, you are to remain here,

in spirit anyway.

DR SCOTT

Great Heavens, that's a laser.

RIFF RAFF

Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of

emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

BRAD

You mean you're going to kill him?

What's his crime?

DR SCOTT

You saw what became of Eddie.

Society must be protected.

RIFF RAFF

Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.

Furter, your time has come.  Say

goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

FRANK

Do your worse - inferior one.

BRAD

Good God.

RIFF RAFF

Yes.

JANET

You've killed them.

MAGENTA

I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

RIFF RAFF

They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

DR SCOTT

(he tries a calming hand)

You did right.

RIFF RAFF

A decision had to be made.

DR SCOTT

(the big sell-out)

You're OK by me.

RIFF RAFF

Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

DR SCOTT

Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

RIFF RAFF

You must leave now Dr Scott while it's

still possible.  We are about to beam

the entire house back to the planet of

transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.

Go now.

MAGENTA

Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -

to sing and dance once more to your dark

refrains.  To take that step to the right...

RIFF RAFF

But it's the pelvic thrust

that really drives you insane.

And our World will do

MEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS

FROM:  JIM SHARMAN				9.12.74

TO:    ALL CONCERNED.

Sc. 148  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N>

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they

to be subjected to?

Then please add:	And what of the floor show that had been

spoken of?  In an empty house?  In the middle of the night.

What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?

What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that

this was to be no picnic.

Sc. 97.  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.  N.

Is replaced by the following:

Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what

Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television

monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's

slave.

SC. 77 pt.

C.S. FRANK				FRANK

Oh no my baby - don't be upset -

it was a mercy killing.  He had

a certain naive charm - but no muscle.
