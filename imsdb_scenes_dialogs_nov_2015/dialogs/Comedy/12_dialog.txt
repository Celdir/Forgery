PLACE: Los Angeles

Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet "Good Cop,

FIRST WOMAN

I've been here one year and I've lived

through an earthquake, fires, floods...

SECOND WOMAN

The rains...it just keeps coming...the

floods...the hillsides are coming down...

you can't get to and from work and it's

just a mess.

THIRD WOMAN

You survive by natural instincts, you

go with the flow.

TALK SHOW HOST (V.O.)

And we're back with "Interpreting

Your Dreams."  And I believe we

have Allen in Hollywood on line...

12. Hello Allen...are you there?

Hello..?

ALLEN

Okay...hold on. Yeah I'll take care of

you in a second...I'm transferring

you over..

TALK SHOW HOST

We are live on the air....Hello...?

ALLEN

Hello.? Yeah okay I've got somebody else

on hold...I'm going to transfer you

over. It might be a second, just hold on.

TALK SHOW HOST

(aside) I'm on hold..

TALK SHOW HOST

Okay, we're going to have to go...

ALLEN

Okay, oh doctor.

TALK SHOW HOST

Hello?

ALLEN

Are you there?

TALK SHOW HOST

You're live on the air.

ALLEN

Can I use my real name on the radio?

TALK SHOW HOST

What is your dream?

ALLEN

First of all I'm invisible. I see

myself looking in a mirror. I'm

having this dream almost every night.

TALK SHOW HOST

Yes?

ALLEN

And the next thing you know I'm

getting married. I don't know to

whom....

TALK SHOW HOST

And how long have you been having

this dream?

ALLEN

Like an entire solid month.

TALK SHOW HOST

Uh huh...

ALLEN

Then all of a sudden I see myself

walking down a road by the harbor....

TALK SHOW HOST

And how do you feel at this point

in the dream?

ALLEN

Can you hold on for one second...

Hello.

TALK SHOW HOST

No, actually we can't...Hello?

ALLEN

Yeah, I've got two other lines.

Can you hold a second? Great....

TALK SHOW HOST

Hello! Allen from Hollywood!

ALLEN

Hello...yeah...hold on. I can

transfer you now.

TALK SHOW HOST

Are you there? Hello?

ALLEN

Hi. Hi. Sorry.

TALK SHOW HOST

Allen we don't have the time....

ALLEN

Sorry..

TALK SHOW HOST

Allen we're on the air and you

can not put me on hold.

ALLEN

I'm really sorry....

TALK SHOW HOST

Go on with your dream Allen.

ALLEN

Am I on?

TALK SHOW HOST

Yes.

ALLEN

Okay. I'm walking along the road down

by the harbor, and I'm invisible, and

I go around looking at people knowing

that they can't even see me and in

this dream.....

ALLEN

... I ride around with people. I get

in their cars, I go all over town.

ALLEN

I mean here...this, this, this.

TALK SHOW HOST

And how does it feel to you?

ALLEN

Can you hold on a second?

- Glasses disappear from

ALLEN

I've got two juice commercials. I'm

like the spokesman for the company now.

I got a Baske and Robbins, and I'm on

avail for a couple of beer things that

are going on..

COLLEAGUE

Hello...

ALLEN

Dr. Powell I'm back....

TALK SHOW HOST

I think we're running out of time

here Allen.

ALLEN

Sorry to put you on hold....You

see then I get out of the car...

ALLEN

...and I walk all day...

ALLEN

...and all night.

TALK SHOW HOST

Don't put me on hold...

ALLEN

No, no, no, no. I'm at work. I'm at work.

TALK SHOW HOST

Is this a real call?

ALLEN

What do you think? Do you think I'd

make a fake call in the middle of work?

TALK SHOW HOST

I'm feeling very left out here because

you're not telling me how you feel.

I'm telling you....

ALLEN

And then this really strange thing

happens.

TALK SHOW HOST

What do you do for a living?

ALLEN

While I'm walking...I'm an Actor...

TALK SHOW HOST

So in other words you are in limbo in

your daily life.

ALLEN

I'm walking, and I see myself walking,

but I don't stop, I just keep on walking.

TALK SHOW HOST

You must be feeling invisible in your

daily life and it's coming out in your

dreams.

ALLEN

I want to know what you think about the

dream, let me finish it! Can you hold on

a second please?

TALK SHOW HOST

You can not put me on hold....I'm sorry

but we're going to have to go to Mike

in Downey on line 13.  Thank you very much

for calling.

"START HERE"

TONY

Come on...

MARIE-NOEL

This isn't the way we came.

TONY

Yes it is.

"ACTOR CREDIT"

TONY

Let's not.

MARIE-NOEL

Let's not. Sorry.

TONY

We'll just go home and we'll wait it out.

MARIE-NOEL

This place stinks!

"ACTOR CREDIT"

TONY

Let's not.

MARIE-NOEL

You know.....You know, at this point I'm

blaming it all on bad karma. This is how

we die, man. I wish they'd just get it

over with.

TONY

Don't give up. I mean nothing has happened

to us. She'll probably be at the boat waiting

for us when we get there.

TONY

Let's not be naive about the earthquake...

TONY

It's a good sign...

TONY

That's what saved us.

MARIE-NOEL

Let me tell you, I had a premonition. I had

the worst feeling when she said she was going

to go up and see the band.

MARIE-NOEL

What if we get it for not warning her?

"Be My Baby"

ALLEN'S VOICE

Hi this is ALLEN at 969-8895. I'm not

home right now but if you want to leave

me a message I'll get back to you as soon

as you can...

"Actor Credit"

ALLEN'S VOICE

If it's important and during the day you

can call me at Knapp Communications. The

number is (213) 932-1465. Uh, I should be

there all day. And if it's not important

and you don't want to call me there leave

a message on this machine but don't hang

up I really hate that and, uh,that's it, bye.

"Director Credit"

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

My despair has a strange shape.  It doesn't

hurt

It's seeing

MARIE-NOEL at about the time of the tragic

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

.....of something hopeless going on and on

year after

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

....When I close my eyes I see the city....

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

But when I go out all I see are clues and

patterns.....

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

...or the endless wait for coincidence.

MARIE-NOEL

Events slowly unfold with the possibility

that

MARIE-NOEL

But at the same time I see that it's exactly

what put Mom in the position she was always in.

TONY

The first time you feel sexual you see fate

all

MARIE-NOEL

Yes, and I really deserve it.

TONY

I have the feeling that that's dad's only

motive.

TONY

They think we are selfish...

TONY in the city, FILMORE on the island.

TONY

They think we should procreate.

INTERVIEWER (V.O.)

So there were two guys and what were their

names?

ALLEN

Not two guys, a girl and a guy.  They were

related.

Greek I know...

INTERVIEWER

And she was the one you were married to?

ALLEN

Yes.

INTERVIEWER

Who own this house?

ALLEN

I do, I mean we did.

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

You stand to lose everything you worked

for in

our inheritance....

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

Why have you set out to prove everything is

here by

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

I wasn't too young to know what happened the

last

like I'm the next to die.

ALLEN

It started this way.

INTERVIEWER

So you're an actor?

ALLEN

Yes.  I'm an actor.  That's where I met

the guy.

ALLEN

I met him at a casting call for a commercial...

He said his name was Tony.

ALLEN

I was late...

ALLEN

So I had to make up an excuse for work..

ALLEN

Some temp job I was working downtown.

ALLEN

It was raining, and there was this flood and

everybody was jittery.

ALLEN

Because something that big in nature doesn't

usually happen around here except an earthquake,

or your occasional rare winter snowstorm every

ten or twenty years.

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

I know why you're so happy all the time.

This

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

Reality is a refraction from a physical

process.

ALLEN'S tabloid interview, at the end, after

CAMERA MAN

Okay, ready to roll.

INTERVIEWER

What's your name?

ALLEN

Allen.

INTERVIEWER

And you were kidnapped by aliens, did you say?

ALLEN

No, no, no, no.  I was involved with this woman

and this guy.

INTERVIEWER

Wait, wait, wait, let me understand this... you

were involved with a goddess?  Like a Greek

goddess?

ALLEN

With a Greek, Zeus, Athena type goddess.

INTERVIEWER

Where is she now?

ALLEN

She's like hunting quail in the Sierras now.

INTERVIEWER

What?

ALLEN

She

INTERVIEWER

And were you married?

ALLEN

Yeah, we were married right before....

"Allen at about the time the disasters

WE HEAR Door slam. Off Screen. ALLEN and AUGUST (as ARTEMIS) walk into living room. AUGUST leads the way in, glances into the bedroom on the left.

ALLEN

Look around. It's a 1 bedroom, 1/2 bath

in

downstairs.

AUGUST

Is it quiet?

ALLEN

Very quiet. Where you from?

AUGUST

Nashville.

ALLEN

First time in LA?

AUGUST

Yeah, I just got a "Seventeen" cover and

everyone

ALLEN

Where are you staying?

AUGUST

With my Aunt.

ALLEN

Do you act?

AUGUST

No, just modeling for now. But I've heard about

some really great workshops from my agent.

ALLEN

I'm an actor. TV commercials, some stage.

I know just about everybody in town, free

advice, comes with

AUGUST.

How much is it?

ALLEN

Well, the first month's free. You've got

to come up with some kind of security deposit,

figure one

and that comes to

in the ad.

AUGUST.

(No response)

ALLEN

Does that seem like a lot?

AUGUST

Well for Tennessee standards, but I don't know.

ALLEN

Do you know why the apartment's only half per

month of the going rate for this size apartment

in Hollywood?

AUGUST.

No.

ALLEN

Because I sleep here 1 night a week.

VOICE

TONY, are you there?  Come on!

Pick up the phone!

VOICE

TONY, are you there, Tony! Tony! Tony!

TONY

Do you have a church key?

BARBER

What will it be?

TONY

I'll......

GUYS

Yeah, what'll it be man?

TONY

I want to cure my passive aggressive

personality.  From now on when I want

something I'm going to ask for it.

I'm going to learn how to be more

observant of signs and consider how

other people might need clearer signals

from me.

GUY 1

Why don't you get a job. That's what

the man says....

GUY 2

...You look good, you'd do great in

an interview.

GUY 1

Join a group. Do something for other

people.

GUY 3

Go up and talk to people. See if you

have someone in common...

GUY 4

Do some charity work...

ALL

Mingle..Be creative. Take chances.

Take ownership.

GUY 3

Ride the bus....

BRENDA

This case is a mess. We don't know what is

going on with the child. No, no, no, no,

no no, the couple is stonewalling. Nobody has

seen the child, in what, 15 years.

Every visit is marked "guardian unavailable".

Nobody bothers because it's the island. And

get this, the couple, they're not married. No.

They're the step-children of the owner of

the island who is now deceased...

BRENDA (continuing)

...I have a sniff writ and I'm going out

there next week.

Beethoven Violin Sonata #4 D Major

DOOLITTLE

The is your meeting so why don't we get down

to business.

DAVE

Sounds fine.

DOOLITTLE

Call Boston if you want. I don't think the

time change will make any difference

DAVE

Your name is Filmore West, correct?

DOOLITTLE

We're requesting an environmental impact study

on the employment angle in Avalon.

DAVE

Are you kidding?  Any loss in jobs will be

absorbed in the Federal tourism franchise.

Employment will double, property and leases

will increase in value. The overall benefit

will be stunning to the average citizen of

Avalon.

DOOLITTLE

What if we tell everybody about the national

resources here. If you'll remember your history

gentlemen, the civil war was won by the

collateral in the Treasury created by the

California gold rush. We think the government

needs a big hit of cash right now to cure the

deficit. Remember what Churchill said, a great

government never has to face the truth nor pay

cash.

DAVE

Could we have a moment?

Mendolshon: Symphony #4 in A, Op. 90

DOOLITTLE

We're looking very good here. Just don't give

them anything they can use. Do not say anything.

DAVE

What if we bring up the legality of him

impersonating his grandfather.

TOSHI

I think we need something stronger. Any

sexual harassment suits or child abuse.

He's a guardian.

BRENDA

Hello, I'm from the department of Human

Services in LA.  I'm looking for a missing

child who may be somewhere on the island.

SHERIDAN

Name?

BRENDA

A Marie-Christine West? Her guardian is a

Mr. Filmore West.

TONY

I think I know what's going on here.

DOOLITTLE

Good, good, good, good, just don't say anything.

BRENDA

Did they have a child with them? Or did they

take this child with them?

OFFICER

They're brats. They're very unpopular

around here. They're keeping the property

values from tripling.

BRENDA

Great, where can I find them?

SHERIDAN

Probably France. What would you do if you

owned all of Catalina and Anacapa..?

OFFICER

...all the way to San Miguel including

the Big Island which has

and the IRS are looking for them?

DOOLITTLE

Don't say anything.

DAVE

I'd like to direct your attention to the

signatures on these documents.

DOOLITTLE

This is intolerable!

DAVE

One is a reconveyence of a second deed of

trust, and the other is your recent letter

to us. You would have been 4 years old at

the time of the first document.

TONY

You guys believe in fairy tales don't you?

DAVE

We want to know who you are.

TONY

This reminds me of the Tempest where the

rightful Duke is robbed of his kingdom by

his evil brother...

TOSHI

Were you born in this country?

TONY

...and the evil brother puts the good Duke

and his daughter out to sea in a small boat

to die. And at the end of the story....

DOOLITTLE

My client is using a figure of speech.

DAVE

Then where are we going with this, guys?

TONY

You two are going to jail.

DOOLITTLE

We're saying....you don't have enough money.

TONY

What do you say next?

TOSHI

We're just representing the United States

Government in an attempt to take what the

people have a right to.

TONY

Big Brother. Orwell! No, no, That's too recent.

DOOLITTLE

The situation is irreversible.

DAVE

What are you going to do?  Act it out for us.

TONY

...And it's raining and hailing and lightning's

striking and you guys think that I'm dead, but

I'm not. I'm really back in the big island with

my daughter.

TONY

And you know what we're doing. Playing chess,

and having a picnic!

BACH Concerto in D minor

COUNTER PERSON

Hi.  Can I help you?

BRENDA

Which way to the Big Island?

RANCH HAND

You must have slept a long time.

TONY

I've been sleeping a lot lately.

RANCH HAND

Yeah about 2 years.

RANCH HAND

A woman named Reggie Swan confirmed she'll

arrive March 4th. She'll be staying until

September.  I got the bunk house all ready

for her.

RANCH HAND

There have been quite a few fly-overs by

the park service.  The last 6 months

there has been surf on the North point.

Anyone who can afford a boat has been

streaming up here like freeway commuters.

TONY

Yeah.

RANCH HAND

This thing with the surfers has become

some sort of a cult. There have been a

few entries on the South shore, young men

looking for Marie-Noel...I vacated them

immediately.

TONY

Uh huh.

RANCH HAND

The park service has been on the island

almost full time, as expected, and the

monk from the monastery arrived for

another year.

SCHUBERT'S WINTERREISE

MARIE-NOEL

Where have you been. He's here.

MARIE-NOEL

Dresses?

TONY

More in the boat.

MARIE-NOEL

Books?

TONY

Likewise.

MARIE-NOEL

How was LA?

TONY

A dry hole.

MARIE-NOEL

Why did you let the animals go? Here's

a story about animals that caused erosion

on the Channel Islands. We don't need any

more attention right now.

TONY

I scattered them for their own

protection. And it doesn't bother me

because any animal, no matter where it

starts, turns out the same.

MARIE-NOEL

Do you remember seeing my moon earrings

anywhere have you?

TONY

The ones you were wearing the night .....

MARIE-NOEL

The night of the great unpleasantness?

TONY

Is there anything about Halloween in

Edgar Allen Poe?

Heavy Rock

MARIE-NOEL

OK, let's just stop talking about it....

TONY

I guess it's about time. It was starting

to bug me.

Bach Unaccompanied Cello Suites - Suite #2

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

20 November, the mirror never reflects my

despair, just water running in the sink.

TONY

You can stop living out of suitcases and

fix

MARIE-NOEL

Oh, and you can go and enjoy your life in

LA.

TONY

What's that supposed to mean?

MARIE-NOEL

You get to come and go as you please and

I'm stuck here in this dirty hideout.

TONY

I'm in the same situation you are.

Moving or sitting still is the same

thing, they're everywhere.

MARIE-NOEL

What about the government?

TONY

I think we can stall the government

until the next gubernatorial election.

MARIE-NOEL

Forget it.

Bach Unaccompanied Cello Suites - Suite #2

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

If my dilemma is the dilemma of art, what

would the art character do?

STOPS

TONY

If anything happens to me you

should take the train East...

TONY

...We both came from the West. I think

we'll be heading that way.

MARIE-NOEL

Well, you'll be all set up in LA if

anything happens to me.

TONY

We've had a good life. We've been lucky.

All these extra years are for stories.

There's nothing left to do except to see

how we fit into them.

MARIE-NOEL

You know, I've looked everywhere. There

are no references to two people leaving a

Halloween party anywhere in Western, Eastern,

Sumerian, or comic book literature.

TONY

I thought we were going to drop that.

MARIE-NOEL

What was your mother's favorite book?

TONY

How should I know?

MARIE-NOEL

We both should have written these things

down. That's why I have a diary now.

TONY

You'll know what to do when the time

comes.

MARIE-NOEL

I protest in advance any role where I

am resolved as ineffective, irrelevant,

marginal, unable to influence, yet always

influenced and, in short, any role where I

am victimized by circumstance. These are

my politics and someone's going to have

to deal with them.

TONY

Good.

Ravel String Quartet in F

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

16, November. You asked me to remember the

time before I came here. I remember a

shipwreck and a storm that washed out all

the roads.

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

I remember a dream from my childhood. In

the dream a prince comes from the sea...

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

...and lives with me and my old father.

There was England,..

MARIE-NOEL (V.O.)

...back stage with my mother all those

years while I grew so slowly. France,

India...

MARIE-NOEL (V.O)

French Indochina...

MARIE-NOEL (V.O)

then here...beside the arbitrary sea.

WOMAN

What are you doing in my apartment? What

are you doing here?

WOMAN

And who's pizza is this? Excuse me!

ALLEN

Calm down. We weren't expecting you for

a while, we had the exterminator come in

like you requested...

WOMAN

Oh you did?

WOMAN

And who the hell is this?

ALLEN (aside to H. TOM)

Take this stuff out for her.

WOMAN

You've got pizza in my place...you're

lying here. Who's clothes are these?

ALLEN

There's no pizza here; there's no clothes

here.

WOMAN

You had no permission to come into my

place. A guy sleeping in my bedroom,

sleeping on my couch.

ALLEN

I'm going to request to the board that

you perhaps should be kicked out for your

bad sculpture.

WOMAN

Oh you are?  Get the hell out of here.

What kind of manager are you anyway?

ALLEN

Hi, Aunt Debbie?

AUNT DEBBIE

What's that on your face?

AUNT DEBBIE

Did you move that refrigerator to my new

building?

ALLEN

Yes.

AUNT DEBBIE

Liar. Your car doesn't work.

AUNT DEBBIE

Who's this?

H. TOM

I'm his assistant ma'am.

ALLEN

Shut up!

AUNT DEBBIE

Does he pay rent?

H. TOM

No ma'am.  When I find a job I'm going to

pay rent.

ALLEN

He picks up my residual checks and he's a

really good plumber.

AUNT DEBBIE

Did you steal another car from a tourist?

H. TOM

No ma'am.

ALLEN

Shut up!

(to AUNT DEBBIE)

No we didn't.

AUNT DEBBIE

That refrigerator, did you strap it on

top of the car?

ALLEN

No!

AUNT DEBBIE

And then did you ditch their car?

H. TOM

No ma'am.  The car was towed...

ALLEN

Shut up!

AUNT DEBBIE

So you faked homelessness and begged for

free chicken.

ALLEN

What are you saying Aunt Debbie?

AUNT DEBBIE

The refrigerator is all scraped up and has

no freon. And you smell rancid. And why

are you so fat!

ALLEN

One, two, three..

AUNT DEBBIE

Your cousin just arrived. When you see

her, be sociable!

ALLEN

You know I've been having these dreams

lately where my mother finds me floating

down the river in a little wicker basket

and it turns out that (shouts in the

direction of AUNT DEBBIE) I am not

related to you!

Do you have the time?

MUSICIAN

2:30.

TONY

Do you mind if I ask you a question?

MUSICIAN

Yes.

TONY

Why are you her right now?

MUSICIAN

What?

TONY

Why did you come up just this minute?

MUSICIAN

I'm going to work, man.

TONY

Is this the bus you always take?

MUSICIAN

No,  I'm late.

TONY

You're late! Why are you late?

MUSICIAN

I overslept, man.

TONY

Nothing caused you to be late?

MUSICIAN

I'm just sitting here waiting for

the bus. What's the big deal?  Do you

have to talk to me?

CAR MAN

Oh my god!  I can't fucking believe this!

My car must have popped out of park!  It

could have hit you.  Oh my god, I can't

believe this...800 bucks...Oh my god!

I have a genius IQ. My parents would

have killed if I went into business.

They'd love it.

Bach Suite #2 S. 1008

ALLEN

If they were alive, you know what I'd tell

them? I'd tell them I'm a temp in an

insurance company.

H. TOM

If you assign everything to infantile

motives, life becomes boring. Your

religion only explains your sex life.

ALLEN

You're not listening. I don't want to be

poor. But it's not like I'm doing some I

gotta starve thing here. If I had enough

money I'd be happy.

H. TOM

And then again you may be right, for all

the wrong reasons. Twenty years in the

mind is unfortunately not twenty years in

the body and it get worse and worse as

you go.

ALLEN

Not me. I keep my nut real low. Basically

I live off my relatives. You know?  Free

rent. All the chicks I can pluck from my

aunt's building. All I need is one national

commercial a year and I can live like a

king.

H. TOM

Things are stranger in other places.

ALLEN

Where do you get these things you say,

man. Are you still on acid?

H. TOM

I just say things that come into my head,

because they're more enjoyable than my

own thoughts.

JULIENNE

There's two choices for me right now.

I'm either pregnant or feeling a false

pregnancy.  The first one is impossible.

AUNT DEBBIE

Are you trying to tell your mother that

you're knocked up?

JULIENNE

Incredible weather we're having.

AUNT DEBBIE

I hate it because it makes my skin dry,

especially my private parts.

JULIENNE

In Maine, it's been frozen for two months.

AUNT DEBBIE

Why are you here anyway?

JULIENNE

To take care of you. I thought that giving

it all up and taking care of my old

mother would be the simplest life

possible. What you're telling me about my

cousin Allen is upsetting.

AUNT DEBBIE

Criminy....You sure feel sorry for

yourself.

JULIENNE

Damn right! I didn't come here to get

drawn into slum-lording. What did you

get into mom?

AUNT DEBBIE

My dear husband, bless his soul THE

BASTARD.(with a twinkle in her eye) He

was very good to me..

JULIENNE

You always said that.....

AUNT DEBBIE

It was my idea, not his! Now you're

cousin Allen is the bastard.

JULIENNE

Look mom, I came out here because I

needed to. I've went through a time with

so many regrets. I got ostentatious and

solemn and I hated myself, and

behaved the same way.  Independence works

better alone. I'm a

the gunfighter who hung up his guns.

AUNT DEBBIE

You didn't give them enough sex, that's

your own fault.

JULIENNE

Too many people in my past have been

hurt, and all of them named Tony.

AUNT DEBBIE

Have you seen all these mushrooms around

the house?

JULIENNE

Fato Profungus... I believe they're called.

AUNT DEBBIE

You would know that. But don't eat them.

Mrs. Johnson up the street says they

make you horny. And when are you going to

learn to drive?

JULIENNE

Probably never. I like walking.

Guy Klucevsek "Blue Window"

MORTICIAN

And what qualifies you for this job?

TONY

Well, what is the job?

MORTICIAN

State privacy laws require that we watch over

our guests day and night from the minute they

arrive to the day of the funeral.

TONY

You mean the bodies?

MORTICIAN

Yes. You're the body watcher.

TONY

Oh. The body watcher.

MORTICIAN

TONY

Okay.

MORTICIAN

For example, why do you want this job?

Dead people?

No, no. If I work at night I'll meet people

during the day. See, I don't sleep much at

night.

MORTICIAN

You have two lives? I have two lives. I've

always wanted to be a stand up comic. Do

you mind if I show you some of my material?

Oh hi.

HERMES

We need to talk.

PAN

OK.

PAN

I've been living quietly by myself,

except for the moon-light orgies and me

scoring twice a day.

HERMES

Dad wants to talk to you...because you're

family.

PAN

Hermes, I'll pay you if you get me back

into the organization. I've got this new

pornography you have to see...

PAN

His mother was Jefferson's mistress.

HERMES

We should help him.

PAN

No.

PAN

He lives on my island. There will always

be as many demigods as there are minor

poets. There are too many of them. They

have good lives. They don't need any

help.

JULIENNE

God I have a headache. Do you know the

best thing for headaches?

long as you're name isn't Tony.

TONY

OK.

PAN

Should we screw things up?

JULIENNE

It's a challenge life put before me

overcoming my Tony Karma.

Men want blonds and good breasts. Women

with breasts always do well. They also

consider them honorable and would never

have

Bocherini - Concerto in G Major

ANNOUNCER MONTAGE (v.o.)

6.6 officially if you have been sleeping all

morning. 6.6 it was felt from San Diego to Las

Vegas to Modesto. It was centered exactly under

in Northridge and it is a unnamed fault...We

are in Granada Hills and the power is still

out...Sadly there were three deaths reported

in the Santa Clarita Valley area. The force

blew out storefront windows, there were

landslides in Pacific Palisades left cars

caked in mud. Ruptured gas lines buckled

the roads. The Santa Monica freeway collapsed

near La Cieniega. An apartment complex on

14th and Idaho exploded. One house toppled

down a hill.

HOMELESS WOMAN

After the earthquake was all over we went

down to	the lobby and sad down in the

lobby of the building...

HOMELESS WOMAN

...until the sun came up. And then we went off

to our room to see if there was any damage, it

was pretty bad. It was quiet, there wasn't

anybody driving, there were people just

wandering around, you know we walked out and

we looked and we saw the cracks..... and you

know down the street over here beside the

building was off, a big bell tower up the

street was tilted halfway down, it was sort of

scary......

HOMELESS WOMAN

...and you know down the street over here

beside the building was off, a big bell

tower up the street was tilted halfway down,

it was sort of scary......

TONY

FLEEING TENANT
