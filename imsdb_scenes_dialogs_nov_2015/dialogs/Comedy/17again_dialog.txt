October 2007

COACH HARVEY

Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the

game.

MIKE

Just warming up, Coach.

COACH HARVEY

First game of the season and the

scouts are already lining up. You

have half the season I know you're

capable of, you can play anywhere

you want, Mike.

MIKE

That's the plan coach.

COACH HARVEY

Round up, Jock Straps! Picture

time.

MIKE

Hold on.   Ed's not here yet.

2.

DOM

Who cares?      He's the water boy.

MIKE

And you suck, Dom, but we're

letting you in the picture.

COACH HARVEY

Hey!   Hey!     Knock it off.

ED

Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a

life and death battle with the dark

wizard...

COACH HARVEY

...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.

PHOTOGRPAHER

And 3, 2, 1-

COACH HARVEY

Alright, Ladies, bring it in!

3.

MIKE

Ed, I can't help you with the girls

if you keep showing up places

dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy.

Okay? Dude, don't look now but I

think Muffy Campanella is scopin'

you hard.

ED

For real?

MIKE

Smile, pud.

MIKE (CONT'D)

My bad.

GIRL'S VOICE (o.s.)

Mike?

MIKE

Who's that stone cold fox? Oh,

it's my girlfriend.

(walks over)

I'm glad you're here, Scar. This

whole scout thing's got me wicked

nervous.

DOM

I'm dedicating my first basket to

you, Scarlet.

MIKE

Way you shoot that might be mid-

season!

(to Scarlet)

Everything cool?

SCARLET

Oh yeah. Everything's totally

copacetic.

4.

MIKE                              SCARLET

COACH HARVEY

Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners

get the girls. Losers please

themselves!

MIKE

(to Scarlet)

Excellent. Gotta run.

MIKE (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

ED

Do you really think Muffy's in to

me?

COACH HARVEY

Where you going!? O'Donnell!?

MIKE

Scar!    Wait.

CUT TO:

5.

MIKE

(UNINSPIRED)

Today is going to be a good day.     I

love my job. I am a lucky man.

Who's lucky? Mike O'Donnell.

ACUPUNCTURIST

Can you feel your Qi flowing

freely?

ED

I'm not sure if its my Qi or

internal bleeding.

MIKE

What are you doing now?

6.

ED

There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine.

Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the

rage. Makes you look five years

younger.

ED (CONT'D)

(calls to Acupuncturist)

What's this brown stuff again?

ACUPUNCTURIST

Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein.

ED

Delish!

(to Mike)

The girl has absolutely no clue

what she's doing.

MIKE

Then why are you letting her stick

needles in you?

ED

Because she's hot. But today's not

about me. It's about you becoming

the new regional sales manager.

MIKE

I better be. I've invested 18

years of my life in that miserable

company.

ED

No negativity. Negativity's for

the 800 pound fat lady who needs to

be airlifted out of bed. You,

Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a

winner.

MIKE

A winner doesn't have to crash at

his best friend's house because he

was kicked out of his own house.

ED

Are you kidding?! It doesn't get

any better than this!

(MORE)

7.

ED (CONT'D)

I gotta get back. My legs just

went numb. Good luck today.

WENDY

Congratulations, Mike. You deserve

it. You're like a totally amazing

salesman.

MIKE

Thanks, Wendy. That like totally

means so much to me.

ROGER

Good morning, peeps. As you all

know, today I'll be naming the new

regional sales manager. What's it

take to be an RSM? Leadership

skills, a comprehensive knowledge

of today's prescription

pharmaceuticals and most

importantly a dedicated soldier.

ROGER (CONT'D)

All being said, congratulations-

(Mike begins to rise)

Wendy.

8.

ROGER (CONT'D)

Now go out there and sell some

drugs peeps!

MIKE

How could you do this to me? I've

been a salesman here 18 years.

Wendy's only been here 2 months!?

ROGER

Look, your sales are admittedly

better but she has the college

degree. What can I do?

MIKE

You can give me the promotion,

Roger!

ROGER

Things have changed. I couldn't

even hire you now with only a high

school diploma. My hands are tied,

bro-ski.

MIKE

Alex?

MIKE (CONT'D)

3, 2, 1-

9.

MIKE (CONT'D)

The kid's still got it.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Ooooh.   That was stupid.

MALE VOICE (o.s.)

You know someone in that picture?

MIKE

I do. Me.     I'm in the center

there.

JANITOR

Adolescence can be so cruel.

MIKE

What are you talking about?

(lost in the picture

AGAIN)

I had life by the balls in that

picture. Everything was possible.

Then a few minutes later, pffffft,

all gone.

JANITOR

`For of all sad words of tongue and

pen, the saddest are these: `It

might have been...'

10.

MIKE

That'll be my epitaph.

JANITOR

We all have regrets.

MIKE

Why's it have to be that way?

JANITOR

Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

Can't hurt to ask. You never know

who's listening, Michael.

MIKE

How did you know...

ALEX (O.S.)

...What are you doing, Dad?

MIKE

Hey, Guys.     I was just talking to-

MIKE (CONT'D)

Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You

ready to get some dinner then?

ALEX

Why are you limping?

MIKE

Tweaked my back pumping iron.

Really, really heavy iron.

MIKE

I bet your chompin' at the bit for

hoop season to start.

11.

ALEX

Yeah, me and the guys are running

drills, scrimmaging, getting in

shape.

MIKE

That's my boy. Remember, it's not

how big you are-

ALEX

-it's how big you play.

MIKE

And what about you, Mags?   What's

new?

MAGGIE

Nothing.

ALEX

She got into Georgetown.

MIKE

You did!?    That's fantastic!

MAGGIE

It's no big deal.

MIKE

It's a huge deal. That's a great

university. I'm proud of you.

(Maggie remains quiet)

Am I missing something here?

MAGGIE

You wouldn't understand.

MIKE

Try me.

MAGGIE

I have a lot of emotional stress

right now. My friends are all

going to different schools, I'm not

even sure...

12.

MIKE

That's not stress. Wait `til you

get out into the real world, get a

crappy job, have some smarmy twerp-

boss calling you bro-ski...

ALEX

Did you get the promotion, Dad?

MIKE

Still waiting to hear.

MIKE

Is your mom home?

ALEX

She's probably out back.

MIKE

Hey, next week we'll have a

barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound

good?

MAGGIE

I'm counting down the minutes.

MIKE

What's with her?

ALEX

We see you once a week for a couple

hours. What do you expect?

13.

DOM

Hey, Mike. Good to see you.    Tough

break, you and Scarlet.

MIKE

Bite me, Dom.

MIKE (CONT'D)

A little late for a delivery isn't

it?

SCARLET

Dom was in the neighborhood. He

offered to make a dump run for me.

MIKE

Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?

SCARLET

What's your point?

MIKE

Come on. He's been after you since

10th grade and he's after you now.

SCARLET

At least someone's after me.

MIKE

`In touch with the ground, I'm on

the hunt I'm after you.'

SCARLET

Please, Mike. This isn't high

school. That's not gonna work.

MIKE

`Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a

crowd, and I'm hungry like the

wolf.'

14.

SCARLET

You can stop now. It's not

working.

MIKE

`Mouth is alive, with juices like

wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'

SCARLET

You no longer have the right to

invoke the "wolf."

MIKE

Why are you destroying the yard?

SCARLET

I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for

clients. Thanks for asking.

MIKE

Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?

SCARLET

I am a landscape designer. Then

again you barely took an interest

in my work so I guess that's a fair

question.

MIKE

I didn't get it.

SCARLET

I'm sorry. But maybe this is what

you needed. Maybe it's time you

looked for something else?

MIKE

That's a great idea, Scar. Because

there are so many options out there

for a 36 year old with only a high

school diploma.

15.

SCARLET

And it's all my fault, isn't it?

MIKE

I didn't say that.

SCARLET

No, but it's what you think, right?

SCARLET (CONT'D)

I never asked you to marry me.

MIKE

But I did.

SCARLET

I'm sorry you're not happy with the

way your life turned out Mike,

really, I am, but you're not the

victim here.

MIKE

Jesus!

MIKE

Hey!?     Get away from there!?

16.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Oh no!!   Hello!?

MIKE (CONT'D)

What the-

CUT TO:

MIKE

Damn it.

(pushes doorbell)

Ed! Ed! I lost my key!

ED

Coming!   I've been worried sick!

WHERE-

17.

MIKE

I've had a really rough night.

ED

AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

ED

Don't come any closer!    I'll use

it!

MIKE

What are you gonna do? Exfoliate

me to death?

(Ed shrieks)

You got into my samples case again,

didn't you?

MIKE (CONT'D)

What's your problem, it's only mud.

MIKE (CONT'D)

AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

MIKE (CONT'D)

AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

MIKE (CONT'D)

I'm dreaming right? Is this some

kind of hallucination?

18.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Do something! Anything!    Pinch me!

MIKE (CONT'D)

I said pinch!

MIKE

Calm down! We need to talk!     We

can work this out!

FEMALE VOICE (o.s.)

Aye dios mio!

ED

Maria, we're just friends.   Really.

CUT TO:

ED

My theory is that you were

transformed by a freak congruence

of some of the planets most

volatile elements. I've recreated

the exact contents of the LA River.

The toxic pollutants, the

contaminants.

MIKE

Well, it obviously isn't working.

19.

ED

That's because the cocktail's not

complete.

ED (CONT'D)

Last night we had the worst

electrical storm of the last

hundred years.

MIKE

Is that true?

ED

It was pretty bad.

MIKE

Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you

really think this'll work?

ED

It could.

ED (CONT'D)

Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a

moment.

ED (CONT'D)

What were you doing by the river

anyway?

MIKE

The janitor!

CUT TO:

20.

MIKE

Has anyone seen the janitor? Is

the janitor here? Where's the

janitor?

MIKE (CONT'D)

Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you

tell me where I can find the night

janitor?

JANITOR

I'm the only custodial engineer

currently employed here.

MIKE

There was an old guy, white hair.

I showed him this picture of me-

JANITOR

-Of you?   That picture's from 1989.

MIKE

Right.   Forget it.

VOICE (o.s.)

Can I get a little help in here?

21.

MIKE

Alex?   What are you doing up there?

ALEX

I wanted to see if I could get my

nuts into my esophagus. What do

you think I'm doing!? Get me down!

MIKE

Okay.   Okay. I'll get you down.

ALEX

How do you know my name?

MIKE

I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle

Ed's son. He told me to look out

for you.

ALEX

Uncle Ed has a son?

MIKE

Believe me, it's gonna be a

surprise to him too. Did those

guys do this to you?

ALEX

Goons from the basketball team.

MIKE

But why?

ALEX

Because they can and so they do on

a daily basis.

MIKE

(SHOCKED)

But you're one of them.

ALEX

No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta

go.

22.

ED

Did you find the janitor?

MIKE

He doesn't exist.   Nothing makes

sense.

ED

Did he ask you for your soul?

MIKE

No?

ED

That's a good sign. We can

eliminate Satan.

(clicks on a link)

I think what we're dealing with

here is a spell of enlightenment.

(peruses the page)

"Spell affect"..."casting

procedure"...yada, yada, yada.

Basically it's a learning spell.

There's something you need to

figure out and until you do you'll

stay a kid. My guess is that

janitor was probably a war...

MIKE

...I'm going back to high school.

ED

...lock. I'm sorry. Could you

repeat that? Because I thought you

just said you were-

23.

MIKE

Going back to high school.

ED

Are you out of your freaking mind!?

MIKE

My son was hanging by his underwear

from a bathroom stall door and my

daughter was being mauled by a

smarmy gorilla. They need me.

ED

What about your job?

MIKE

Email and telephone.   I got it

covered.

ED

Well, Scarlet, then.   What are you

gonna tell her?

MIKE

Nothing.

ED

You're just gonna disappear?

MIKE

To be honest, I think she'd rather

have it that way. What's with the

attitude?

ED

Because I know you're going to suck

me into this and I'm not going back

there, Mike. You'll never get me

to go back to Fitch. Never!

CUT TO:

ED

I hate you.

24.

MIKE

Take a deep breath. All you have to

do is enroll me and say as little

as possible.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Are you sure these look legit?

ED

(offended/cocky)

Please. I created software used to

launch the space shuttle. I think

I'm capable of forging some report

cards. What's up with the gear?

MIKE

This is hip teenage apparel. I got

it right off the mannequin at Ed

Hardy.

SECRETARY

Ms. Goodwin will see you now.

ED

First sign this old hag is on to us

I'M-

ED

-so glad we chose this school.   I'm

Ed Freedman.

25.

JULIE

Nice to meet you. I'm Julie

Goodwin, principal here at Fitch

Senior High. And you behind there?

You are?

ED

Oh, right. Sorry. This little

chicken pock here is Mark. Say

hello, Mark.

MIKE

Nice to meet you, Julie.

JULIE

Around here you're going to have to

use Ms. Goodwin. Please, sit.

ED

Before we get started I want you to

know that Mark's a bastard.

JULIE

Excuse me!?

ED

I had him out of wedlock.   So the

answer is yes, I'm very

single...and very rich.

MIKE

Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a

very successful prostitute.

JULIE

O-Kay. Did you bring your

transcripts?

26.

JULIE (CONT'D)

So the last school you went to was

Cutler High in Connecticut. And

you were a straight A student.

Very impressive.

ED

I help him with his homework...a

lot.

MIKE

Oh, dad, the doctor called.     You

were right. It is herpes.

JULIE

I think it's time we got Mark to

class. Lisa! Lisa!

JULIE (CONT'D)

Lisa, will you print out a schedule

for Mark and show him to class?

LISA

Sure.   Come on, Mark.

ED

Be a good boy now.   And sit up

straight.

ED (CONT'D)

They grow up so fast. Mojito?

JULIE

I beg your pardon.

ED

You strike me as a Mojito gal. I

know this little Cuban place, great

PLANTAINS-

JULIE

-Yeah, no. I don't date my

students' parents. It's a rule of

mine.

27.

ED

I'll enroll him somewhere else.

JULIE

I really need to get back to work.

ED

See you at the next bake sale then?

MIKE

Do their mothers know they dress

like that?

GIRL

Those are the Wonder Bras.    Beware.

STAN

What did you did do? Mug the

mannequin at the Ed Hardy store?

JAZZ

Tool!

MAGGIE

Oh thank God he's not here.    I ran

all the way from-

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

Why's that freak waving at me.

28.

MALE VOICE (o.s.)

Take your seats. Stop the talking.

MR. ADAMS

Here are yesterday's tests.    Let's

see how you all did.

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

C-, C, B-, D, D-, F

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

D for O'Donnell.

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

Let me guess. Early acceptance?

(Maggie nods)

Where are we going?

MAGGIE

Georgetown.

MR. ADAMS

If you flunk senior calculus you'll

be lucky to get into beauty school,

missy. So, if you plan on slacking

your way through my class, don't.

Save your parents tuition money and

pick up a blow dryer...

MIKE

Enough!

MR. ADAMS

Excuse me?

MIKE

Do you think humiliating a 17 year-

old in front of her peers is

helpful or do you just get off on

it?

29.

MR. ADAMS

And you are?

MIKE

Mark Freedman. It's my first day.

MR. ADAMS

Well, Mr. Freedman-

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

-you've earned yourself a trip to

the principal's office. Welcome to

Fitch.

MIKE

Is someone barbecuing?

(BEAT)

YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!

MR. ADAMS

Get out, Mr. Freedman!

GAYSIAN

Go Hot Pants! Do your dance, Girl!

30.

BIGGEST LOSER

Look, we feel your pain. We really

do. But life's hard enough,

Brother.

MAGGIE

What's the big deal? He stuck up

for me in class. It was a nice

thing to do.

SAMANTHA

He was totally sexing on you.

LAUREN

He's coming. Pretend you're not

here.

MIKE

Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls.     I'm Mark-

MIKE (CONT'D)

Girls?    Hello? Anyone home?

LAUREN

Oh my God.     Can't you see we're not

here?

MIKE

Good.    So there's plenty of room

then.

31.

JAMIE

Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch.

How sped. (special ed)

SAMANTHA

Look, this table is V.I.P.     You're

a NIP.

MIKE

What's a NIP?

LAUREN

Not Important. Go away.

MIKE

Maggie, why are you friends with

these horrible girls?

MAGGIE

Listen, I appreciate what you did

in class but, I already have a

boyfriend.

MIKE

You have a boyfriend?

(his phone rings)

Excuse me a second.

JAMIE

He still gets calls.    How 2007.

SAMANTHA

I think my grandfather has that

phone.

MIKE

Maggie, could we talk somewhere

ELSE-

MALE VOICE (o.s.)

Yo!

32.

STAN

Bro-ski, what are you doing at our

table?

MAGGIE

Nothing.   He was just leaving.

MIKE

(SARCASTIC)

We should do this again sometime.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Get your hands off her, you little

punk!

STAN

You gotta problem with me, `bra?

MIKE

No, no, I don't.

STAN

Now make like Tom and Cruise.

MAGGIE

That was so not cool.

STAN

What? I'll buy you another ice

cream.

33.

MIKE

It was terrible. The place is

evil, Ed. That building needs to

be exorcised.

ED

Come on. It couldn't have been

that bad.

MIKE

My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed

and sent to every member of student

body.

ED

Yeah, I caught it on youtube.

Funny stuff.

MIKE

They mocked my clothes and phone.

My daughter got a tongue bath in

front of me and I have mint chip in

my ears.

ED

High school's great, isn't it?

BARTENDER

What can I get you?

MIKE

Double scotch neat.

BARTENDER

Funny, kid.

ED

Get the boy a Shirley Temple.

Extra cherries.

MIKE

I'm not going back there.

34.

ED

Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36

years of experience. You should be

dominating these kids, ripping

their hearts out.

MIKE

I know why you're encouraging me

all of a sudden.

ED

Because I'm a supportive dad.

MIKE

Because you want to nail my

principal.

ED

Did she ask about me?

MIKE

She's not your type. She's smart.

ED

As far as I can tell that's her

only flaw. I need a reason to see

her again. You could flunk your

classes, start a fight, vandalise

the place. You'll figure it out.

Then I can rush in, a teary eyed,

helpless, single dad who can't

handle his angry, kitten killing

son. What do you think?

OLDER LADY

I think you should be reported to

child services!

ED

Mind your business, Lady.   This is

a family matter.

MIKE

I can't do it. I don't have it in

me.

35.

ED

Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell

Alex to stop wearing underwear all

together. He'll be fine. That's

what I did.

MIKE

You're right! My kids need me.

ED

At'a boy. Now what you need is a

crash course on being a teen in

2008.

36.

ED

Before you ask, it's a seaweed

wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as

losing an inch or 2 from my problem

areas.

MIKE

There must be a very hot girl

downstairs.

ED

There is.    What are you doing?

MIKE

I forwarded my calls to my new

phone, sent some work emails and

just lobbed one to Scarlet, told

her I was in Peru finding myself.

Think she'll buy it?

ED

Probably not because when she

called earlier I told her you were

being detained at Guantanamo.

Ready for tomorrow?

37.

MIKE

I am so ready.

ED

That ought'a put you over the top.

And don't forget to hook me up son.

SAMANTHA

Oh my god.     Was that-

JAMIE

Did you see-

LAUREN

I told you he was cute.

MIKE

So I've been here a couple days now

and I think I got it figured out.

You girls are lesbians, right?

38.

MIKE

Mind if I sit here?

ALEX

Mark?    You look totally different.

MIKE

I got rid of the bull's eye on my

forehead.

ALEX

Could you move to the left a

little?

MIKE

Who's she?

ALEX

Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish

class.

MIKE

Have you spoken to her?

ALEX

No. I get all stupid so I just

stare.

MIKE

I'll tell you a funny story. The

first time I met your mother I was

so nervous-

ALEX

My mother?

MIKE

What?

39.

ALEX

You said, `the first time I met

your mother I was so nervous...'

MIKE

I did?    That's weird.   Is your mom

hot?

ALEX

Dude.

MIKE

What's going on tonight?    You wanna

hang out? Do something?

ALEX

Really?

MIKE

Yeah you could show me around.

ALEX

Cool.

MIKE

I'll swing by your house around 7.

ALEX

I wouldn't go over there. Stan and

his Baboons have lunch this period.

MIKE

Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Did you girls catch Ellen

yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa

Etheridge jammed-

SAMANTHA

-You're so rude!? We're not gay.

We like boys.

JAMIE

Yeah, Samantha's a total slu...

40.

LAUREN

Last New Year's Samantha made it

with my boyfriend.

SAMANTHA

I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't

believe you keep bringing that up.

JAMIE

Rad phone.

MIKE

I know. I'll text you...NOT.

Later...much.

SAMANTHA

Like we'd ever give you our

numbers.

STAN

Heads up!

MIKE

Stan. Did mommy sew that on there

so you wouldn't forget your name?

STAN

You think `cause you got a haircut

and new clothes people'd forget

what a fag you are?

MAGGIE

Cut it out, Stan.    Let's eat.

41.

STAN

Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch.

MIKE

You know, Stan, I feel sorry for

you.

STAN

You don't know me.

MIKE

Oh but I do. All too well. You're

the man. Captain of the basketball

team. Dates the pretty girls.

High school is your kingdom.

MIKE (CONT'D)

But, People, Stan's a bully. Why?

It would be way too easy to say

Stan preys on the weak because he's

simply a dick. No, Stan's more

complex than that. According to

leading psychiatrists Stan is a

bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under

all that male bravado there's an

insecure little girl banging on the

closet door trying to get out. 2,

like a caveman, Stan's brain is

underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is

unable to use self-control so he

acts out aggressively. And the

third reason-

MIKE (CONT'D)

I'd argue that Stan suffers from

all 3.

MIKE (CONT'D)

(WINKS)

Don't hurt yourself big boy.

42.

MIKE (CONT'D)

(to himself)

3, 2, 1...

MIKE

My guidance councilor made me come,

but just so you know I'm not

planning on going to college.

MRS. MENCER

A lot of kids feel that way. Don't

be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to

take a look.

MRS. MENCER (CONT'D)

A good place to start is here...

this book has information on every

college and university in the

country.

MIKE

Thanks.

43.

ED (o.s.)

Hello?

MIKE

It was incredible! I was

incredible! You should'a seen me!

I humiliated Stan in front of the

entire lunchroom. Everyone was

clapping. The popular girls were

begging to give me their numbers!

ED

See what happens when you put a

little lipstick on the pig? Did you

manage to get sent to the

principal's office?

MIKE

Man, I feel great! I even shot some

hoops after school. No aches. No

pains. Gotta run, Buddy.

SCARLET (o.s.)

Coming!

SCARLET (CONT'D)

I've been dying to meet you. I've

known your father since...(gasps)

MIKE

Is something wrong?

SCARLET

(FLUSTERED)

No. It's just...you look

like...No. I'm fine. Come in.

Please.

44.

SCARLET

And you say Ed Freedman is your

father?

MIKE

That's my dad. All 68 inches of

him.

SCARLET

You don't look anything like him.

If you don't mind me asking, who's

your mother?

MIKE

My mother...she...she was...a...

MIKE (CONT'D)

-a convict. In New Jersey. They

met while dad was at Princeton.

She was on parole. B&E, fist

fighting, shanking. Nothing major.

But she's dead now.

SCARLET

Oh?   I'm sorry.

MIKE

I warned her about kite surfing

during hurricane season. So how

are things with you? Doing

anything exciting? Dating?

Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?

SCARLET

Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed

tell you to say that?

MIKE

I mean do what you want. You're a

grown woman but, word on the street

is Dom's been spreading gingivitis

all over town.

SCARLET

I'll keep that in mind, Mark.

45.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

It's crazy how much you like my

husband when he was a teenager.

MIKE

You doing some gardening?

SCARLET

I am. I'm a landscape designer.

I'm actually redoing the backyard.

I'll show you.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

It's a work in progress so you'll

have to use your imagination some.

MIKE

I almost don't even recognize

it...er...if I had seen it before I

probably wouldn't recognize it.

SCARLET

You wouldn't have. It was a

disaster back here a few days ago.

Obviously I have a lot to do still.

I'm laying the sod next and the

limestone pathway will go here.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

Then I'll plant all those, over a

hundred different types of flowers

and plants. I have an amazing

fountain being delivered that'll go

here and a bench over there.

(MORE)

46.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

And I'll string rows of tiny, white

lights above it all so every night

will be a starry one. It'll be a

real sanctuary back here.

MIKE

It seems like a lot'a work for one

person, Scar.

SCARLET

My husband's the only one that ever

calls me that.

ALEX

Yo, Mark.    Let's do this.

MIKE

Good luck with the project.

SCARLET

Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be

home by 10:30.

MIKE

How's your mom doing? You know,

with your dad not being around and

all.

ALEX

She doesn't like to show it but I

know she's bummed. I think it

bothers her more that he hasn't

called me or Maggie in a while.

Whatever.

SAMANTHA'S TEXT

Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but

w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo.

sam.

47.

MIKE

I have no idea what this says?

ALEX

It says `What up? Mobbing it to

Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be

right back. Back. Got to go.

Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam.

MIKE

Let's hit the beach, wingman.

SAMANTHA

We were on his myspace page.

There's a picture of him jamming

with the Chili Peppers at

Coachella.

JAMIE

I heard Timbaland wants to produce

an album with him.

LAUREN

Yeah, but he turned him down to

help orphans with Brangelina in

Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.

SAMANTHA

Oh my God!     I bet he knows Justin.

ALEX

This looks boring. Let's go back

to my house and play video games.

48.

MIKE

What are you so nervous about?

ALEX

The beach is for the older, cool

kids. I don't belong here.

MIKE

What are you talking about? You're

a basketball player. You're cool.

ALEX

I don't play basketball. I mean, I

can play, I just don't play on the

team.

MIKE

But I thought you were getting

ready for the season?

ALEX

I never told you that.

LAUREN

Here he comes!

MAGGIE

Can he be any lamer? Using my

little brother to get to me?

SAMANTHA

If that boy was an apple he'd be

delicious.

ALEX

Oh, man.   It's her.   She's here.

49.

MIKE

Who?

ALEX

She's so pretty it makes me gassy.

MIKE

Calm down. Here's what you're

gonna do. You're gonna go over

there and introduce yourself-

ALEX

She won't like me, Mark.   I'm a

loser.

MIKE

Why? Because Stan says so? You

think Stan's a winner? He's going

nowhere. You're a great kid. Any

girl would be lucky to get your

attention.

ALEX

Really?

MIKE

Really. And right now, there's a

girl over there who's dying to meet

you.

ALEX

Okay.   What do I say?

MIKE

Just introduce yourself. Then

compliment her on something she

never gets complimented on. Like if

she has big, meaty, man hands tell

her she should be a hand model.

(Alex burps nervously)

And don't burp on her.

ALEX

I can do that.

50.

SAMANTHA

You came! Why don't we take a walk

somewhere private and play?

JAMIE

I don't think so, Sam. Mark

promised me a walk on the beach.

LAUREN

Walk with me. I've got less miles

on me.

NICOLE

Hi.

ALEX

Hi, Alex.     I'm Nicole.

NICOLE

You don't look like a Nicole.

ALEX

You have big, meaty man hands.    You

should be a hand model.

NICOLE

Oh my God!     Seriously!?

GIRL 1

I think he got some on me!

51.

ALEX

Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real

nervous and I've wanted to talk to

you for so long. And Mark told me

to compliment you on something you

never get complimented on but I

couldn't find anything because

everything's so...perfect.

NICOLE

Do you want to sit down, Nicole?

MAGGIE

What do you want?

MIKE

Stan.   Why are you dating him?

MAGGIE

Get to the point why don't you?

MIKE

I'm serious. He's not a nice guy.

Matter of fact he's a jackass.

MAGGIE

Don't talk about him like that.

You don't even know him.

MIKE

I know he bullies your brother.

MAGGIE

Stan barely knows Alex exists.

We're moving in together after

graduation.

MIKE

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you

were going to Georgetown?

MAGGIE

I'm going to Westwood Community

College. Stan and I both are.

52.

MIKE

The hell you are, Young Lady! If

you think I'm gonna let you throw

your life away on some Sleestack

you're crazy! I forbid you to see

him anymore and that's final!

MAGGIE

Who do you think you are!?   My

father?!

MIKE

Don't you walk away from me,

Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

SAMANTHA

Who's Margaret?

LAUREN

He doesn't even know her name.

JAMIE

He's so not into her.

SCARLET

I haven't heard from him in three

weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.

ED

He cares.

53.

SCARLET

Then where is he?

MIKE

What's going on?

SCARLET

Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping

something off.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

Our court date is the 27th. If he

has anything to say, he can say it

then.

MIKE

What was that all about?

ED

That envelope contains divorce

papers.

ED (CONT'D)

But what do you care? You're going

to college, right? Life's one big

panty raid for you.

MIKE

I don't know what you're talking

about?

ED

I saw the applications in your

room.

MIKE

You went through my room!?

ED

If you'd cleaned like I asked I

wouldn't have had to. You can't be

serious about this can you?

54.

MIKE

I have to face the possibility that

I might never turn back and if

that's the case, I'm going to do it

right this time around.

ED

Karmically speaking, in the next

life you're coming back as a

hemorrhoid.

ED (CONT'D)

I'm not paying for college!

STAN

You like her, don't you?

MIKE

Who?

STAN

My girlfriend. She told me you

were trashing me at the beach.

MIKE

Leave her alone, Stan.    She's a

good kid.

STAN

I don't know how good she is yet

but after I find out, she's all

yours.

55.

MR. ADAMS

Settle, people.

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

This was your homework. Who can

come up here and solve this for me?

Anyone?

MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)

Not one person. Fine. Miss

O'Donnell. Come up here and dazzle

us with your brilliance.

STAN

Stuck!!!   I'm stuck!   My fingers!

MR. ADAMS

Sit down, Stan! Sit down!

STAN

It's glue! I'm glued to

everything!

56.

JAZZ

I'll get it off!

STAN

No!    No!   Don't pull--!

ALEX

I got your text.     What's so

important?

MIKE

This year you're making the team.

We practice everyday `til try outs.

That gives us a week and a half.

ALEX

Forget it.

MIKE

Yeah, you're right. You probably

don't have any skills anyway.

ALEX

Hey!     I got skills.

MIKE

So what's your problem?      Is it Stan

and his friends?

ALEX

Just leave it alone.

MIKE

You don't need to be afraid of

them, Alex.

ALEX

I'm too small anyway.

57.

MIKE

That's why we focus on your speed,

dribbling and outside shot.

Remember, it's not how big you are-

ALEX

-it's how big you play.

(QUIZZICALLY)

Where did you hear that?

MIKE

(COVERS)

I don't know? Read it somewhere I

guess. Be a sport. Show me what

you got.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Alright.   You got a little game.

STAN

What are you 2 queers doing in my

gym?

MIKE

Let's go, Alex.

STAN

I don't think so. You girls wanna

play with the boys then let's play.

2 on 2.

MIKE

We'll save you the embarrassment

for try-outs.

STAN

Come on, Ally. Embarrass me.

58.

MIKE

Back off, Stan.

ALEX

It's okay.     I got him.

STAN

You ready?     Here it comes.

STAN (CONT'D)

2 points!     And I was fouled!

COACH HARVEY

Hey! That's enough! That's

enough!

ALEX

My mom's been in there a while.

She's gonna be pissed.

MIKE

Act like you're hurt and she won't

be able to stay mad at you.

ED

Way to go, slugger! Get any shots

in?

59.

SECRETARY

Mr. Freedman, your son has a black

eye.

ED

Wuss!

ED (CONT'D)

Hey, Alex.     How you doin', buddy?

ALEX

I'm okay I guess.

ED

Good. Good.

(turns to Mike, nudges

HIM)

Nice goin'. How do I look?

Anything in my teeth? How's my

breath?

SCARLET

Ed.

ED

Hey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it?

My first parent/principal

conference.

SCARLET

Fighting?     What's gotten into you?

ALEX

(rubs his jaw)

I can't talk, Mom.     My jaw.

SCARLET

(MELTS)

My poor baby. And how about you,

Mark?

60.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

Ouch.   You poor thing. Does it

hurt?

MIKE

Not anymore. You smell great.

SCARLET

Alex, I'll meet you at the car.     I

need to talk to Uncle Ed for a

second.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

Did you give him the divorce

papers?

ED

I sent them to him.

SCARLET

Is it another woman? I can handle

it. Tell me the truth.

ED

I haven't heard from him, really.

SCARLET

Okay. If you do, please have him

call home. For the kids...I'm

running out of excuses-

ED

I'll tell him.    I promise.

JULIE

Ed, come on in.

61.

ED

I'll take it from here.

ED (CONT'D)

I'm heartbroken. The boy's

incorrigible.

JULIE

Look, if it was only one isolated

fight it wouldn't distress me all

that much. Boys will be boys.

But, it's also been brought to my

attention that Mark may have Krazy

glued a boy to his chair.

ED

My son?     Mark!   Get in here!   Now!

ED (CONT'D)

Did you glue a boy to his chair?

MIKE

No.

ED

See? The boy's out of control.

He's acting up at home. He won't

eat his vegetables-

MIKE                                 ED

MIKE                                ED

62.

JULIE

Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to

be the new kid but if I have

anymore trouble from you, you'll be

facing detentions or worse. You

can go now.

ED

He's crying out for help and I

don't know what to do. It hurts so

bad. Maybe we could discuss this

over margaritas?

JULIE

Let's give him time to figure it

out on his own. If the situation

gets worse then we'll take the next

step.

ED

You're the expert. I'm just a

single dad out here blowing like

dust in the wind.

MIKE (o.s.)

Got an extra pair of gloves?

SCARLET

Gloves are for sissies.

MIKE

Yeah, but I just had a manicure.

SCARLET

(LAUGHS)

You're serious? You want to help?

MIKE

Are you kidding? I love

landscaping!

(MORE)

63.

MIKE (CONT'D)

It's right up there with watching

"Sex and the City" and snuggling.

SCARLET

Mark, I'm 36 years old-

MIKE

I'm just doing this to make a few

bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.

SCARLET

(BLUSHES)

Embarrassing. Sorry.      I'll give

you 10 dollars a day.

MIKE

Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that

rate I should be able to buy

tickets in...2011.

SCARLET

Fine.   20.     Grab a roll.

MIKE

What are the benefits like here?

SCARLET

I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.

MIKE

Deal.

MIKE

Maggie?

64.

MAGGIE

What do you want? To rub it in my

face? Say I told you so?

MIKE

You lost me?

MAGGIE

Stan dumped me.

MIKE

What happened? What did he do?

You didn't...

MAGGIE

My mom was working last night.

Stan came over with a box of-

MIKE

Your next word better be `cookies'

or you're in big, big trouble!

MAGGIE

What am I going to do?    I can't

live without him.

MIKE

Maggie, did you two...you

know...do...

MAGGIE

Do what?

MIKE

That thing...that rabbits do a lot

of and that a girl your age should

never do and should only do when

she's married.

MAGGIE

Sex?   No, that's why he dumped me!

65.

MIKE

There, there now.       It's okay.

MAGGIE

Sure he was a jerk but he was there

for me. Which is more than I can

say for any other man in my life.

MIKE

When you're young everything seems

like the end of the world. But

it's not. It's just the beginning.

And you might have to meet a few

more jerks, but one day you'll meet

a boy who treats you the way you

deserve to be treated...like the

sun rises and sets with you.

MAGGIE

You really think so?

MIKE

I know so.

MAGGIE

You're so sweet.

66.

67.

CUT TO:

68.

COACH HARVEY

That makes 11-3. Game over.

Gather up.

COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)

You've gotta little bit of your old

man in you, O'Donnell.

COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)

As you all know due to the amount

of seniors coming back I only have

2 open spots on the roster. It's

Freedman and O'Donnell. The rest

of you hit the showers.

ALEX

Wooo!   We did it, Mark!    We did it!

MIKE

You killed it out there!

COACH HARVEY

Son, I don't know where you came

from but you just made my year.

ALEX

Mom!    Mom!

SCARLET (o.s.)

I'll be right out, Honey!

69.

MIKE

I got'a use the bathroom.

SCARLET

Mark? I didn't know you were

there.

MIKE

I'm sorry.     You just look so

beautiful.

SCARLET

Thank you.

MIKE

Can I zip you up?

SCARLET

I'm wearing a sweater.

MIKE

Your jeans?

MIKE (CONT'D)

Stupid, idiot, stupid.

MIKE

Maggie, what...

70.

MAGGIE

Shhh. I get it now. Why you didn't

want me to be with Stan, the nice

things you said in the library.

It's because you wanted me.

MIKE

Maggie, listen to me.    I'm not the

person you think...

MAGGIE

Shhh. Yes, you are. You're a good

guy. You're not like the others.

MIKE

That's right! I'm not like the

others. I'm very different than

the others. So different that you

and I can never be...

MAGGIE

What are you trying to say?    Are

you..."confused"?

MIKE

Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm

confused. Extremely confused.

MAGGIE

Ohmygod! It all makes sense now!

Your hair. The highlights.

MIKE

What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay.

I'm...I've been in love with the

same girl since I was 17.

MAGGIE

Who is it? Does she go to our

school? Do I know her?

MIKE

No, you don't. Now-

(eyes the toilet)

-if you don't mind?

71.

MAGGIE

Tell your girlfriend she better

keep a close eye on you.

MIKE

Who you texting?

ALEX

My dad.   I have to tell him about

today.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Did you just get a text?

MIKE

(NERVOUS)

Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean

dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll

just call him back.

SCARLET

So?   What happened? Tell me.     Tell

me.   I'm dying to hear.

ALEX

I did it. I'm a Falcon!     The first

game's in 2 weeks.

SCARLET

Oh my God, Alex! That's so

incredible!

SCARLET (CONT'D)

I'm so happy for you. And now I

want to show you guys something.

72.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

Ta da!

MIKE

You hung the lights!

SCARLET

I wanted you to be the first to see

it.

ALEX

Mom, it's sick.

MIKE

It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm

sorry I never saw how talented you

are...I mean when people see this

and how talented you are you'll be

designing sanctuaries all over the

city.

SCARLET

(BEAMS)

Thank you.

ALEX

Mom, why are you all dressed up?

SCARLET

Oh my God. I almost forgot.    I

have a date.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Let's see who the lucky guy is.

73.

MIKE (CONT'D)

I knew it!

MIKE (CONT'D)

I knew you had a thing for him!

You can't do this! You took vows.

What kind of example are you

setting for the kids!?

SCARLET

Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am.

But I'm too old for you.

DOM

Wow. You look absolutely

ravishing.

MIKE

Keep it in your pants, Casanova.

SCARLET

Don't mind him. You all set?

DOM

Let's do it.

DOM (CONT'D)

Hey, kid...if the vans'a

rockin'...well you know the rest.

MIKE

Don't you lay a finger on her,

Johnson! I know where you live!

74.

ALEX

It's weird to think about my mom

with someone other than my dad.

MIKE

It's adultery! If this were

Afghanistan she'd be dragged

through the village by goats.   You

need to talk to her.

ALEX

My mom's been pretty sad the past

few months. She deserves to be

happy. My dad obviously

is...wherever he is.

MIKE

Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he

could be here right now with you

but there's a real good reason he

can't be.

ALEX

No, my dad's not a family guy. This

is dumb but I used to tell him I

was on the basketball team because

I knew he'd never make it to a

game.

MIKE

Then why would you tell him that?

ALEX

I guess I was hoping it would make

him like me more.

MIKE

My wife's moving on. My son

doesn't think I like him and my

daughter's in love with me. I need

to change back, Ed.

75.

ED

What about college?

MIKE

I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep

til I die. I just want my family

back.

(BEAT)

You're not gonna wear that, are

you?

ED

Baby's got back.

ED (CONT'D) (o.s.)

Now that Julie's agreed to go out

with me tonight, I need you to

start behaving. I can't have her

thinking my son is a complete

degenerate.

MIKE

Fine. I want to have some kids

over tonight to celebrate Alex

making the team. Is that cool?

ED

Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I

remember hearing what those parties

were like, kids peeing everywhere,

food on the ceilings, puke in the

pool.

MIKE

Listen to you. You sound like an

old man.

ED

No party. I mean it.    Don't make

me take the car away.

MIKE

Don't treat me like a child, Ed.

76.

ED

I won't when you stop acting like

one.

SALESMAN

Sir!   Please!

ED

This isn't over...son!

MIKE

Not even close...Dad!

CUT TO:

MIKE'S TEXT

Party at my house 2nite.   7.    Get

the word out.

77.

MIKE

Give me that!

WONDER BRAS (O.S.)

Hey, Sexy.

MIKE

I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?

SAMANTHA

Dance with us!

LAUREN

Nambib-bib-ib, that African country

makes me horny.

JAMIE

Perfect, aren't they?

SAMANTHA

Which one of us is it gonna be?

MIKE

I thought you girls wanted to

dance?

78.

STAN

I was upset. I'm sorry. But I

need you to show me you love me.

Then we'll move in together.

MAGGIE

Whatever.    I'm with someone else

now.

STAN

Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid

enough?

MAGGIE

Him.

MIKE

Party's over, Stan.      You're out of

here.

STAN

Who's gonna make me leave?      You?

MIKE

I would but it smells like you've

been drinking so I'll let the cops

do it.

STAN

You can have the nun.      She doesn't

put out anyway.

79.

MIKE

On second thought-

HOSTESS

There you are, Mr. Freedman.

ED

Thanks. Put this towards your

studies.

JULIE

When you asked me to get together

to talk about Mark this isn't what

I envisioned. This isn't a date,

Ed.

ED

Are you insinuating that I'd use my

son's misfortune just to go out

with you? What kind of a father do

you think I am?

JULIE

As long as we're on the same page.

WAITER

Good evening. Would you care to

see the wine-

ED

Bring us the 1962 Petrus.

ED (CONT'D)

You're going to love this wine.

$2000 dollars a bottle.

80.

JULIE

I don't drink. So tell me what you

think's going on with Mark?

ED

It's baffling really but I noticed

he's been drinking a lot of diet

ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?

JULIE

You didn't ask me here to talk

about Mark, did you?

ED

Do you like caviar? Because if you

do you have to try the Almas. 100

year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.

JULIE

You're disgusting, Ed.

ED

What? You don't like Beluga?     You

can get something else.

JULIE

I'm not some 22 year-old who you

can impress with caviar and

expensive wine.

ED

Would the caviar and expensive wine

impress you if you were on a yacht

off Monte Carlo?

JULIE

I came here because I'm concerned

about the wellbeing of your son but

you don't care about Mark. All

you're concerned with is proving to

me how wealthy you are.

ED

I do care about Mike...Mark.

Whatever his name is.

JULIE

You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm

sure when you were the guy the boys

picked on and the girls ignored you

were really sweet.

(MORE)

81.

JULIE (CONT'D)

But you thought becoming rich would

solve all your problems. Instead it

made you just like them. I have to

go.

ED

Wait. You're right. I'm acting

like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please

stay.

JULIE

Act normal or I'm leaving.

MIKE

I had the craziest dream. I was 17

again and back in high school. It

was horrible, Scarlet-

MAGGIE (o.s.)

Scarlet!?

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

I'm the hungry lioness and you're a

baby gazelle.

MIKE

Wait! This is highly inappropriate

and dysfunctional. Listen to me,

Maggie. I'm your father.

MAGGIE

And I've been a bad, bad girl,

Daddy.

82.

ALEX

How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time

she rolls her r's she spits all

over me.

ALEX

Mike, I blew it!     I totally blew

it!

MIKE

Blew what?     What happened?

ALEX

She wanted me to kiss her but I

panicked. I didn't know if I

should close my eyes or which way

to turn my head or how much tongue

I'm supposed to use-

MIKE

Slow down. Have you ever kissed a

girl before?

ALEX

Not a real one. I used to practice

on my dad's Playboys.

MIKE

How did you find...forget it. It's

easy. All you have to do is take

her face in your hands gently like

THIS-

83.

MIKE (CONT'D)

-hold her still as you adjust your

head, close your eyes and kiss her.

The rest happens naturally.

BOY

That is so wrong.

ALEX

What if I, you know, pitch a tent?

MIKE

If you feel it, you know, getting

angry, take a step back. Now go get

that kiss.

ALEX

Nicole.

NICOLE

I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-

SAMANTHA'S TEXT

911.   ^stairs. mastr b-room.

84.

SAMANTHA

We decided not to make you choose.

JAMIE

You can have all 3 of us.

MIKE

(looks sadly at the Bras)

Girls, if I was 20 years younger

I'd...probably only last 10 seconds

anyway. Put your clothes back on.

SAMANTHA

Was he crying?

ED

God's honest truth. I had the

whole costume. I used to go

everywhere dressed like a wizard.

No wonder I didn't get a date all

through high school. Annnnd you

think I'm the biggest nerd ever.

JULIE

No, no, really. I don't.

(catches her breath,

suddenly serious)

Hark! Who goes there?

ED

(UNSURE)

Tis I. The Wizard they call

Marius. And who might you be fair

maiden?

85.

JULIE

Tis I! Elf Princess Ariala of

Jamroar.

ED                               JULIE

ED                             JULIE

ED

Check please!

MIKE

I'm so dead.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Oh no!

MIKE (CONT'D)

Scarlet, what are you doing here?

SCARLET

I'm looking for Alex. It's past

his curfew and he wasn't picking up

his phone. Is he here?

MIKE

Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his

girlfriend.

SCARLET

Alex has a girlfriend?

86.

MIKE

He does and she's really cute.

Come on.

JULIE

How did you get your hands on the

5th edition? That's not due out for

another three years.

ED

I have two words for you.    Russian

mafia.

JULIE

Drive faster.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Calm thyself, Marius.

ED

That little-!   I'll kill him!

KID

It's Ms. Goodwin!    Run!

87.

ED

Everybody out!   Get out!   Get out!

JULIE

This party is over! If you don't

want to spend the next 3 months in

detention you will leave...now!

ED

Do you know where Mark Freedman is?

GIRL

I think I saw him go outside.

MAGGIE

Have you seen Mark?

SAMANTHA

We're looking for him too.

SCARLET

He's like a totally different

person.

SCARLET (CONT'D)

It's been so good for him to have

you around. You have no idea.

88.

MIKE

Believe me, I do. He's a great

kid. And you're an amazing mother.

SCARLET

I'm not so sure. I mean look at

me. I showed up at a party to drag

my son home. Could I be any more

embarrassing? And how many amazing

mothers run their kids' father off?

MIKE

Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't

blame yourself for his stupidity.

SCARLET

I knew he was unhappy. I knew he

hated his job. I should've been

more supportive, more sympathetic

to what he was going through. He

gave up a lot for me.

MIKE

That's bull shit! You, Maggie and

Alex are the best thing that ever

happened to me...him. He was just

too selfish to recognize it. At

least, that's how I see it.

JAMIE

He's over there.    By the pool.

SAMANTHA

Who's the ho?

MAGGIE

Mom?

ALEX

Whoa.   What's my mom doing here?

89.

SCARLET

You're sweet. I have no idea why

I'm telling you all this. There's

just something so familiar...

SCARLET (CONT'D)

What do you think you're doing!?

MIKE

Scar, just calm down. I have

something to tell you but I need

you to keep an open mind. Can you

do that for me?

SCARLET

This conversation is over, Mark.

MIKE

I'm not Mark.

SCARLET

I'm not in the mood for games.

MIKE

It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike.

It's me...your husband.

SCARLET

What?   Why would you say that?

MIKE

It's the truth. I'm the father of

your children. You have to believe

me.

SCARLET

Don't ever come near me or my

family again. If you do, I'll have

you arrested or better yet,

institutionalized.

90.

MIKE

Let me explain, Scar.

SCARLET

Your son needs a shrink!

MAGGIE

Pervert!

MIKE

Alex, wait. Let me explain-

ALEX

How could you do this to me?

ED

This place is a disaster! A kid

pissed all over my English garden!

What were you thinking!?

MIKE

She hates me, Ed.    I've ruined

everything.

JULIE

Who hates him? What's going on?

ED

Oh boy. I don't quite know how to

put this.

JULIE

Try being honest.

91.

ED

He's not really my son.    I don't

have a son.

JULIE

Mark's obviously having a crisis

and you...you insensitive bastard,

you disown him? He'd be better off

with his mother in Thailand.

ED

Should I call you?!

ED

Come on.   It's been 2 days.    Open

up.

ED

Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey

Dahmer's kitchen in here.

ED (CONT'D)

Are you alright?

MIKE

I really messed up.    I've lost my

family.

92.

ED

That's not true.      Nothing's ever

truly lost.

MIKE

What about you and Julie?

ED

Oh, that?    That's lost.

MIKE

Sorry about the party.      I'll pay

for any damages.

ED

Don't worry about it. My spa guy

got the last of the vomit out of

the pool so we're good. I don't

mean to rub salt in your wounds but-

ED (CONT'D)

-you're due in court in an hour.

BAILIFF

-the whole truth and nothing but

the truth so help you God?

SCARLET

I do.

93.

JUDGE

You've requested a divorce by the

State of California citing

irreconcilable differences. Is

this correct?

SCARLET

Yes, your Honor.

JUDGE

Is Michael O'Donnell or his

representative present?

SCARLET

(SADLY)

No, your Honor.

JUDGE

Then I take his absence as

agreement to the orders of the

divorce. Let's proceed. You're

not asking for alimony or child

support?

JULIE

No, your honor.

ED

What exactly are we doing?

MIKE

I don't know. We just need to stop

her from going through with it!

ED

A well thought out plan.   Good job.

JUDGE

The mother will have full custody

of the children. The father will

have visitation rights of one

weekend a month-

94.

ED

I declare a mistrial on the grounds

of insufficient evidence and Sacco

and Vanzetti!

JUDGE

Sacco and...what are you....who are

you!?

ED

I am legal counsel for Mike

O'Donnell and I demand a stay of

execution for this marriage, your

Majesty.

SCARLET

He's my husband's best friend.

JUDGE

Are you a lawyer, best friend?

ED

No but I have been a defendant in

numerous lawsuits so-

JUDGE

Bailiff! Get these 2 out of my

courtroom.

MIKE

Your Honor! I have a letter from

Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read

it. Please.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, but-

SCARLET

If it's okay, your Honor.   I'd like

to hear it.

JUDGE

Make it quick.

95.

MIKE

Thank you, your Honor.

(READS)

September 7th, 1988 was the first

time I saw you. You were reading

`The Great Gatsby' and wearing a

Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never

seen anything so perfect. I

remember thinking I had to have you

or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda

way but in that beautiful,

innocent, unaffected way that way

only a 17 year-old kid can have.

You whispered you loved me at the

homecoming dance and I felt so

peaceful and safe because I knew no

matter what happened from that

night on nothing could ever be that

bad because I had you. And then I

grew up, lost my way and blamed you

for my failures. But I was never

lost. I'd just forgotten the way

life makes you forget as you grow

older. And I never failed at

anything because on that September

day you said `yes' to me. And at

that dance you said you loved me.

And as I stand here...as I write

this, I want you to know if I don't

have you I'll die...not in a psycho

way but in that beautiful,

innocent, unaffected way only a 17

year old kid can have....oh

and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the

Wolf'.

JUDGE

Alright, son, you have to go now.

JUDGE (CONT'D)

Let's proceed.

SCARLET

Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry.   I'm

in no shape...I need to

postpone...I'm sorry.

96.

ED

Maybe it wasn't a spell of

enlightenment.

MIKE

What are you talking about?

ED

According to the website once

you've learned your lesson you'd

turn back. That speech should've

broken the spell.

MIKE

Enough with the magic crap, Ed.

ED

You know what this means? You need

to let them go. You need to let

them get on with their lives and

you need to get on with yours.

97.

ED

Where you going?

MIKE

I'm moving on. See you at the

game.

COACH HARVEY

Hey, Freedman, save some for the

game.

MIKE

Just warming up, Coach.

COACH HARVEY

Son, I haven't seen anyone with

your shooting ability in, well, in

a long time. I called a couple

college scouts I know. They're

coming to the game tonight...to

watch you. If you have half the

season I think you're capable of,

you can play anywhere you want.

MIKE

That's the plan, Coach.

98.

COACH HARVEY

Round up, Jock Straps! Picture

time.

PHOTOGRPAHER

3, 2, 1-

MAGGIE

(to Scarlet)

I thought he was hanging out with

Alex to get to me- not you.

COACH HARVEY

Alright, Ladies, bring it in!

MIKE

ALEX-

ALEX

I have nothing to say to you.

MIKE

I never meant to hurt you-

ALEX

Then why'd you kiss my mom!?

99.

MIKE

Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know.

I'm sorry.

ALEX

You're lucky I don't punch you out.

ED

Julie, can I talk to you?

JULIE

What is it, Ed?

ED

I've seen a good friend of mine

lose everything that means anything

to him. And maybe we'll never be

there but...I just really want to

play D & D with you.

JULIE

You can raid my dungeon anytime.

ED

I'll bring my long bow.

COACH HARVEY

Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners

get the girls. Losers please

themselves!

100.

REFEREE

Son! Come back here!      You're gonna

get a delay of game!

COACH HARVEY

This can't be happening again.

MIKE

It's your turn now.    Good luck.

COACH HARVEY

Get off your butt, O'Donnell!    Get

in there!

MIKE

Scar!

SCARLET

What took you so long?

MIKE

The best choice I ever made was

you.

SCARLET

How did this happ-

101.

MIKE

Don't ask.

MIKE (CONT'D)

I think it's best if we don't tell

the kids about this. Especially

Maggie.
