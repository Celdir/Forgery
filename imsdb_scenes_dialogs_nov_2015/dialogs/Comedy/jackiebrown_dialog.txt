JACKIE BROWN

Jackie Brown

Screenplay by Quentin Tarantino

JACKIE

(into mike)

Flight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now

boarding Gate 12, first class only.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON:

SIDNEY

(to camera)

Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.

The popular TEC-9 is advertised by

its makers as being tough as the

toughest customer.

BLACK MAN (O.S.)

That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass

spray gun outta South Miami.

BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Cost three-eighty retail. I get them

for two hundred and sell 'em for

eight.

ORDELL

This TEC-9? They advertise it as

being the most popular gun in

American crime. Can you believe that

shit? It actually says that on the

little booklet that comes with it.

"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"

like they're proud of that shit.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Check out this body-builder chick...

Now see what she got. That's a Styer

aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.

Listen.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Shit's expensive, man. Comes from

Austria. My customers don't know shit

about it, so there ain't no demand.

(to Melanie)

Baby, I could use some more ice.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

But put that bad boy in a flick,

every motherfucker out there want

one. I'm serious as a heart attack.

Them Hong Kong movies came out, every

nigga gotta have a forty-five. And

they don't want one, they want two,

cause nigga want to be "The Killer."

What they don't know, and that movie

don't tell you is a .45 has a serious

fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try

and steer a customer towards a 9-

millimeter. Damn near the same

weapon, don't have half the jammin'

problems. But some niggas out there,

you can't tell them anything. They

want a .45. The killer had a .45,

they want a .45.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Thanks, Baby.

LOUIS

Who's your partner?

ORDELL

Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in

Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to

him, gets it to my customers. On all

my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't

have a pot to piss in or a window to

throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,

motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He

got himself a yacht, with all kinds

of high tech navigational shit on it.

(back to video)

AK-47, the very best there is.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

When you absolutely, positively,

gotta kill every motherfucker in the

room, accept no substitute. That

there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-

fifty and double my money.

ORDELL(CONT'D)

Get that for me, will ya baby?

MELANIE

You know it's for you.

ORDELL

Girl, you better not make me go over

there and put my feet to ya.

MELANIE

Hello.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

It's for you.

ORDELL

(into phone)

Yeah.

(pause)

Hey, Junebug, what's up

MELANIE

(referring to the tape)

It's boring, isn't it?

LOUIS

I can sit through it once.

MELANIE

He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

LOUIS

I'm impressed. He knows a lot.

MELANIE

He's just repeating shit he

overheard. He ain't any more a gun

expert than I am.

MELANIE

Want a hit?

LOUIS

Sure.

MELANIE

When did you get out of jail?

LOUIS

Four days ago.

MELANIE

Where at?

LOUIS

Susanville.

MELANIE

How long?

LOUIS

Two months shy of four years.

MELANIE

Four years?

LOUIS

Uh-huh.

MELANIE

What for?

LOUIS

Bank robbery.

MELANIE

Really, I'm impressed.

MELANIE

Four years that's a long fuckin time.

ORDELL

See, what did I tell you? Man in New

York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and

Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want

it? It's the gun that nigga on "New

York Undercover" uses. Because of

that nigga, I can sell it to this

nigga for twelve-fifty.

LOUIS

What's your cost?

ORDELL

As low as two.

LOUIS

Are you serious?

ORDELL

That's what I been tellin' you. Start

adding these motherfuckin' figures

up, and you tell me this ain't a

business to be in.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

I got me five M-60 machine guns.

These came straight from the Gulf

War. I sold me three of them so far,

twenty grand a piece.

LOUIS

That's good money.

ORDELL

Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna

make me a million dollars out of

this. I already got me a half-a-

million sittin' in Mexico. When I do

this last delivery, I'm gonna make me

another half-million.

LOUIS

Then what?

ORDELL

I get out. Spend the rest of my life

spending.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Who is it?

MELANIE

It's Beaumont.

ORDELL

(into phone)

BeaumontOrdell. What's the problem?

(pause)

What the fuck you doin' in jail?

(pause)

What the fuck you doin' that for?

(pause)

Ain't you got better sense than to be

drivin' drunk carrying a goddam

pistol?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

- Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.

Number one, you need to chill out,

nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit

ain't as bad as you think it is.

(pause)

Course you're scared. That's what

these motherfuckers get paid for

scarin' the shit outta ya. That's

their job. And my job is to get you

the fuck home so let me tell you what

is gonna happen... May I speak?...

Thank you... You gonna spend the

night in jail; it's too late to get

you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna

take you into court. I'm gonna be

there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm

gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut

you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll

be back home, I promise.

(pause)

So just calm your ass down, and I'll

see you tomorrow.

(pause)

You owe me a helluva lot more than

one, nigga.

(laughs)

See you.

CUT TO:

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

... the judge doesn't give a fuck

about that. He's ready to habitualize

you. Is that what you want - you

wanna look at ten years?

MAX (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll

get you out, I promise. But it means

I gotta pick you up tonight.

MAX (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Reggie, there ain't no two ways about

it. You're spending the night in

jail, but I already told you I'll get

you out tomorrow. Now where are you?

(pause)

You're at your mother's house, aren't

you?

MAX (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Okay. Just stay put till I come for

you.

(pause)

Reggie, do yourself a really big

favor and be there when I get there.

MAX (CONT'D)

How can I help you?

ORDELL

(indicating the Viceroy)

Where would you like me to put my

ash?

MAX

Use that coffee cup on the desk.

ORDELL

And I need me a bond for ten

thousand.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Oh, that's just my white friend,

Louis. He's got nothing to do with my

business. We just hangin together.

We're on our way to a cocktail

lounge.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

(returning to the photo)

Who's that big Mandingo nigga you

gotcha arm around?

MAX

That's Winston. He works here.

ORDELL

He's a big one. You two tight?

MAX

Yeah.

ORDELL

It was our idea to take the picture,

wasn't it?

MAX

So, you want a ten-thousand dollar

bond. What've you got for collateral?

ORDELL

Gonna have to put up cash.

MAX

You have it with you?

ORDELL

It's in my bag.

MAX

You have cash. What do you need me

for?

ORDELL

C'mon, you know how they do. Black

man comes in with ten thousand, they

wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they

gonna wanna know where I got it.

Second, they gonna keep a big chunk

of it - start talkin' that court cost

shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go

through you.

MAX

Cost you a thousand for the bond.

ORDELL

I know that.

MAX

Who's it for? A relative?

ORDELL

Fella named Beaumont. They have him

up at county. It started out drunk

driving, but they wrote it up

"possession of a concealed weapon."

Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

MAX

Ten thousand sounds high.

ORDELL

They ran his name and got a hit. He's

been in before. Besides, Beaumont's

from Kentucky, and I think they're

prejudiced against black men from the

South out here.

MAX

He takes off and I gotta go to

Kentucky to bring him back, you pay

the expenses.

ORDELL

You think you could do that?

MAX

I've done it.

MAX (CONT'D)

What's his full name?

ORDELL

Beaumont. That's the only name I

know.

MAX

(on phone)

Records office.

MAX (CONT'D)

(back on the line)

Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry

Bail Bonds. Who's this?

(pause)

Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to

look up the booking card and rough

arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.

(pause)

That's all I have. I believe it's a

surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.

LOUIS

I'm going to wait in the car.

ORDELL

Sure.

(to Max)

We almost done, ain't we?

MAX

Getting there.

ORDELL

You go wait in the car. Wait a

minute.

ORDELL

Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

LOUIS

Which one is for the car?

ORDELL

(holding a key)

This one's for the ignition...

(holding a little black

box)

... but you gotta hit this thing to

shut the alarm off and unlock the

door.

LOUIS

What do I do?

ORDELL

You ain't got to do nothing. Just

point at it and push the button.

You'll hear the car go "bleep." That

means the alarm's off and the doors

are open.

LOUIS

Okay.

ORDELL

Now play the volume as loud as you

want but don't touch my levels. I got

them set just the way I want 'em.

MAX

(to Ordell)

Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL

Livingston, huh?

MAX

On his prior, he served nine months,

and he's working on four years'

probation.

ORDELL

You don't say.

MAX

Do you know what he's on probation

for?

ORDELL

Haven't a clue.

MAX

Possession of unregistered machine

guns.

ORDELL

Will they consider this a violation

of his probation?

MAX

They do consider this a violation of

his probation. Your boy's looking at

ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

ORDELL

Man, he won't like that. Beaumont

don't got a doin' time disposition.

MAX

I need your name and address.

ORDELL

Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I-

E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton

90222.

MAX

House or apartment?

ORDELL

House.

MAX

Now I need you to count your money.

ORDELL

Hope you don't mind me askin' where

you keepin' my money till I get it

back. In your drawer?

MAX

Across the street a Great Western. It

goes in a trust account. You'll need

to fill out an Application for

Appearance Bond, an Indemnity

Agreement, a Contingent Promissory

Note. That's the one, if Beaumont

skips and I go after him, you pay the

expenses.

ORDELL

Beaumont ain't going nowhere.

(he takes a pen out of

his pocket)

Where do I sign?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

(reading the form)

Hey, Max.

MAX

(still counting money)

Yes.

ORDELL

(still reading form)

I was wondering. What if before the

court date gets here, Beaumont gets

hit by a bus or something and dies.

(he puts the form down

and looks at Max)

I get my money back, don't I?

CUT TO:

BEAUMONT

(into the speaker)

Who is it?

ORDELL

It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me

up.

ORDELL

Look at you and your free ass. Come

over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.

BEAUMONT

What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,

man. What the fuck can I say? Thank

you... thank you... thank you.

ORDELL

Who was there for your ass?

BEAUMONT

You were there for me.

ORDELL

Who?

BEAUMONT

You.

ORDELL

You goddam right!

ORDELL

You see,iit works like this. You get

your ass in trouble, I get your ass

out. That's my job. And I don't mind

tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

BEAUMONT

I'm still scared as a motherfucker,

Ordell. They talkin' like they

serious 'bout me doin' that machine

gun time.

ORDELL

Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a

fright in your ass.

BEAUMONT

If that's what they want to do,

they're doin' it.

ORDELL

How old is that machine gun shit?

BEAUMONT

Three years.

ORDELL

Three years. That crime's old, man.

They ain't got room in prison for all

the motherfuckers out there killin'

people. How they gonna find room for

you?

BEAUMONT

That's not what they're tellin' me.

ORDELL

That's why they call it "fuckin' with

ya." Now you wanna hear how we

retaliate?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to

Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let

me tell you a little bit about my

lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and

this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my

own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,

he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And

like Johnie Cochran, dude hates

fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man

lives to fuck with the police. So as

a favor, I had him look at your case.

Stacin told me you aint got shit to

worry about. They just fuckin' wit

ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on

their ass, make 'em -

(he bumps fist with Beaumont)

... Stop fuckin' wit ya!

BEAUMONT

Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you

know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.

ORDELL

Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was

kinda hopin you could come with me.

BEAUMONT

What'd ya mean?

ORDELL

Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,

does a nigga a favor - then BAM -

hits a nigga up for a favor in

return. But I'm afraid I gotta be

that kinda nigga.

BEAUMONT

What?

ORDELL

I need a favor.

BEAUMONT

That requires me goin out tonight?

ORDELL

A bit.

BEAUMONT

Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on

goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,

man. I'm home, I'm high -

ORDELL

Why the fuck you at home? Cause I

spent ten thousand dollars gittin'

your ass home.

(changes tone)

Look, I gotta problem. I need help,

and you can help me.

TIME CUT:

BEAUMONT

What's the problem?

ORDELL

Well, it ain't so much a problem a a

situation. Remember I sold those

three M-60 machine guns outta the

five I got?

BEAUMONT

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

This group of Koreans in Koreatown

have started a Neighborhood Watch

kinda thing. And they want a few

weapons so the neighborhood niggas

know they mean business. So I'm gonna

sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.

Only problem, I aint never dealt with

these Koreans before. Now I aint

worried. Asians are by and large real

dependable. They don't want no

trouble. You might argue about price,

but you aint gotta worry about them

shootin' you in the back. But I got

me kind of a rule. Never do business

with nobody you ain't never done

business with before without backup.

That's why I need you, backup.

BEAUMONT

Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out

nowhere -

ORDELL

- Let me finish. Can I finish?

BEAUMONT

Go ahead.

CUT TO:

ORDELL

Now you're gonn be in the trunk

holding onto the shotgun. And I'm

going to tell them I'm opening up my

trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up

the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad

boy.

BEAUMONT

Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'

anybody.

ORDELL

What the fuck I tell you. You don't

hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the

gun. They'll get the idea.

BEAUMONT

I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL

We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll

be in there - ten minutes.

BEAUMONT

Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk

no minutes. Why don't I just ride

with you?

ORDELL

You can't ride with me. The surprise

effect is ninety percent of it.

BEAUMONT

Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't

gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL

I can't believe you do me this way.

BEAUMONT

I ain't doin' you no way. I just

ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a

problem with small places.

ORDELL

Well, my ass has got a problem

spending ten thousand dollars of my

own goddam money to get ungrateful,

peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I

do it -

BEAUMONT

Look, man, I know I owe you -

ORDELL

- Well, if you owe me, git your ass

in the trunk.

BEAUMONT

- I wanna help you, but I don't wanna

be locked in the trunk of no car.

ORDELL

You think I wanted to spend ten

thousand dollars on your ass?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Answer the question, nigga. Do you

think I wanted to spend the thousand

dollars on your ass? Yes or no?

BEAUMONT

Course you didn't.

ORDELL

But the only way to help you was to

do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,

how 'bout this? After we're through

fuckin' with these Koreans, I take

you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

My treat.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Just think, man. That Scoe's special,

smothered in gravy and onions. Get a

side of red beans and rice.

Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.

BEAUMONT

Now exactly how long I gotta be in

this motherfucker.

CUT TO:

ORDELL

Don't worry. It's just me.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

I was wondering. Did any federal

people come visit you in jail and I

should be watching my ass?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

You wouldn't tell me if they did and

I wouldn't blame you.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Hello.

ORDELL

Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

LOUIS

Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

ORDELL

Whatcha watchin'?

LOUIS

Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back

and forth. They had some black girl

from some black show on Jay Leno. I

watched that for a bit, but I kept

flippin channels cause I didn't know

who she was.

ORDELL

Guess where I am?

LOUIS

I dunno.

ORDELL

I know you don't know. I said guess.

LOUIS

The moon - I dunno

ORDELL

I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-

cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked

outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.

LOUIS

You're outside?

ORDELL

Uh-huh.

LOUIS

C'mon in.

ORDELL

Naw, man. I just told you, I'm

comfortable. I ain't about to walk

into that roach motel and get

uncomfortable. You bring your ass out

here.

LOUIS

I'm in my underwear.

ORDELL

Then put your goddam drawers on, and

get your ass out here. I got

somethin' to show you.

ORDELL

You know what your problem is, Louis?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

You think you're a good guy. When you

go into a deal you don't go in

prepared to take that motherfucker

all the way. You go in looking for a

way out. And it ain't cause you're

scared neither. It's cause you think

you're a good guy, and you think

there's certain things a good guy

won't do. That's where we're

different, me and you. Cause me, once

I decide I want something, aint a

goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop

me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun

get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.

Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get

removed. Understand what I'm saying?

LOUIS

Who was that?

ORDELL

That was Beaumont.

LOUIS

Who was Beaumont?

ORDELL

An employee I had to let go.

LOUIS

What did he do?

ORDELL

He put himself in a situation where

he was gonna have to do ten years in

the penetentiary, that's what he did.

(taking out a Viceroy and

lighting it up)

And if you know Beaumont, you know

there aint no way in hell he can do

no ten years. And if you know that,

you know Beaumont's gonna go any

goddam thing Beaumont can to keep

from doin' those ten years including

telling the Federal government

everything they want to know about my

ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear

case of him or me. And you best

believe it aint gonna be me. You know

what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on

this with me, you gotta be prepared

to go all the way. I got me so far

over a half-a-million dollars sittin'

in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San

Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one

more delivery, I'm gonna have me over

a million. You think I'm gonna let

this little cheese eatin' nigga here

fuck that up? Shit, you better think

again. 'Fore I let this deal get

fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in

the head, and ten niggas look just

like em.

(pause)

Understand what I'm sayin'?

LOUIS

Yeah.

ORDELL

So we on the same page then?

LOUIS

I follow.

FADE TO BLACK:

VOICE (O.S.)

Miss Brown.

DARGUS

Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.

L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in

that bag?

JACKIE

The usual things. I'm a flight

attendant with Cabo Air.

NICOLET

Can I be of some assistance?

JACKIE

I doubt it.

(to Dargus)

Who's your friend?

DARGUS

This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet

with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

Would you mind if we looked in that

bag?

JACKIE

Would I mind? Do I have a choice?

DARGUS

You have the right to say "no." And I

have the right to make you wait here

with Ray while I go get a warrant.

And if I don't want to go through all

that trouble, I could just take you

in on suspicion.

JACKIE

Suspicion of what?

NICOLET

All he wants to do is peek in your

bag. I'll watch he doesn't take

anything.

JACKIE

Go ahead.

DARGUS

I'd say there's about, oh, fifty

thousand dollars here. What would you

say Ray?

NICOLET

That looks like fifty thousand

dollars from here.

DARGUS

This is your money?

JACKIE

If I were to tell you "no it

isn't..."

DARGUS

You should know if you bring in

anything over ten thousand you have

to declare it. You forgot or what?

You could get a two hundred and fifty

thousand dollar fine, plus two years

in prison. Now you want to talk to us

about it, or you want to talk to

Customs?

JACKIE

I'm not saying another word.

NICOLET

Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind

if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch

of fuckin' pricks in Customs.

Something about that job makes them

kinda hard to get along with. Now, do

you want to talk with a bunch of

suspicious, disagreeable people like

them, or a couple good-hearted guys

like Mark and myself.

DISSOLVE TO:

DARGUS (O.S.)

Hey, this is my office. There's no

smoking.

JACKIE

Arrest me.

DARGUS (O.S.)

We could, smart ass... or we could

work out what's known as a

Substantial Assistance Agreement.

That is if you're willing to

cooperate. Tell us who gave you the

money and who you're giving it to.

NICOLET (O.S.)

You got a good lawyer?

DARGUS (O.S.)

Can she afford a good one is the

question. Otherwise she'll be in

Sybill Brand three weeks easy before

the Public Defender gets around to

her.

NICOLET (O.S.)

Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont

Livingston?

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Don't know Beaumont? That's funny

'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he

did know you, Beaumont was found in

the trunk of a car - dead. Shot

twice. Once in the head and once in

the chest.

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I had the chance to talk to Beaumont

yesterday. You see, like you,

Beaumont found himself in some hot

water. He was looking at ten years he

was pretty sure he didn't want to do

and was understandably concerned. Now

maybe you don't know Beaumont, but

Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does

the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.

DARGUS (O.S.)

If you don't want to talk to us, I

guess we'll just have to hand you

over to Customs.

JACKIE

Okay, let's go.

DARGUS

You know, Miss Brown, there's

basically three types of people that

we come along in the performance of

our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.

Victims, witnesses, innocent

bystanders... You ain't any of these.

Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These

sonabitches have dedicated their

lives to a life outside the law. That

ain't you either. Where you belong is

the third category. The category we

refer to as LOSERS.

JACKIE

I'm not a loser.

DARGUS

Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were

flying for TWA and got busted for

carrying drugs. You were carrying

them for a pilot husband of yours. He

did time and you got off. But that

ended your career with the big

airlines. Cut to thirteen years

later. You're forty-four years of

age. You're flying for the shittiest

little shuttle-fucking piece of shit

Mexican airline that there is. Where

you make a whopping twelve-thousand

dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva

lot to show for a twenty year career.

And to top it off, you're going to

jail. Now true, the judge, even with

your prior, will probably only give

you a year or two. But this doesn't

seem like the time of life you got

years to throw away.

(pause)

Now, we don't like trying losers like

they're criminals. But in the absence

of a criminal, we will try you. Now,

wasn't this money given to you by an

American living in Mexico by the name

of Cedric Walker?

NICOLET

You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much

for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us

about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever

the hell it was he worked for out

here, he wouldn't say. Could it be

the same person you were supposed to

deliver this money to?

DARGUS

I'd like your permission to open this

again. So we'll know exactly how much

money we're talkin' about here.

JACKIE

Help yourself.

DARGUS

While you're at it, let me see what

else is in there. You mind?

JACKIE

My pocketbook.

DARGUS

What's in it?

JACKIE

Beauty products.

NICOLET

I'll count the money.

DARGUS

What's this?

JACKIE

That's my diet shit.

DARGUS

Let's see what else is in there.

NICOLET

Oh, Miss Brown?

JACKIE

Yeah?

NICOLET

And what would this be, Sweet and

Low?

JACKIE

What the fuck is that shit?

NICOLET

I know what it looks like.

JACKIE

You planted that shit on me.

JACKIE

Look, that shit ain't mine.

NICOLET

(to Dargus)

It isn't enough for Trafficking, but

how 'bout Posession with the Intent

to Distribute?

DARGUS

Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with

all the cash, I think I could go with

Conspiracy to Traffic.

JACKIE

I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'

about that fuckin' shit.

NICOLET

Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you

have a seat and tell us who might

know something about this fuckin'

shit.

CUT TO:

DARGUS

If she'll cooperate with us, we'll

turn possession with intent into

plain ol' Possession, and she can

bond outta here for one thousand

bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll

go for the Intent and request a

twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.

JACKIE

You tell those guys they'll have to

do one helluva lot better than that

before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

PUBLIC DEFENDER

Well, that's the State's offer. If

you plead to possession and tell

L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your

bond will be set at one-thousand

dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will

request one at twenty- five thousand

based on your prior record and risk

of flight. If you don't post it or

don't know anyone who can, you'll

spend six to eight weeks in County

before your arraignment comes up.

JACKIE

Who's side are you on?

PUBLIC DEFENDER

I beg your pardon?

JACKIE

What if I plead guilty?

PUBLIC DEFENDER

And cooperate? You might get

probation.

JACKIE

If I don't cooperate?

PUBLIC DEFENDER

With the prior? You could get

anywhere from a year to five

depending on the judge. You want to

think about it? You got two minutes

before we're up.

JUDGE

Brown. Case number 700324.

JUDGE

The charge is possession of Narcotics

with the Intent to Distribute. How

does your client plead?

PUBLIC DEFENDER

She wishes to stand mute, your honor.

JUDGE

Very well...

(to Dargus)

... Detective Dargus - You're the

arresting officer in his case,

correct?

DARGUS

That's correct, your honor.

JUDGE

You have a recommendation for bail?

DARGUS

Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the

defendant's prior conviction and the

extreme possibility of flight due to

her occupation, the State requests a

bond of no less than twenty-five

thousand.

JUDGE

I'll set bond at ten thousand and set

the date of August 14th for the

arraignment.

JACKIE

When is that, your honor?

JUDGE

That's six weeks from now, Miss

Brown. We'll continue this matter

then. Owens, case 72242.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON:

ORDELL

Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you

wash your hands.

MAX

Comfortable?

ORDELL

The door was opened, so I just came

right in.

MAX

I can see that. Why?

ORDELL

I got some more business for ya.

MAX

Oh, yeah? What did he do?

ORDELL (O.S.)

She is an airline stewardess. Got

caught coming back from Mexico with

some blow. They set her bond this

afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what

I was thinkin', you could use the ten

thousand you owe me from Beaumont and

move it over on to the stewardess.

MAX

The bond for possession is only a

thousand.

ORDELL

They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'

it Possession with Intent. A black

woman in her forties gets busted with

less than two ounces on her, they

call that shit Intent. Same shit

happened to a movie star. It's

Possession.

MAX

It still sounds high.

ORDELL

She had, I believe it was... fifty

grand on her, too. There was a cop at

the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.

wanted her bond set at twenty-five

thousand, saying there was a risk of

flight. Jackie being a stewardess and

all.

MAX

Before we start talking about

stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of

the way first.

ORDELL

Somebody already did.

MAX

What?

ORDELL

You didn't hear?

MAX

Hear what?

ORDELL

Somebody with a grudge blew

Beaumont's brains out - hey, that

rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.

MAX

Did the police contact you?

ORDELL

Very first motherfuckin' thing they

did. They see I put up a big money

bond on my boy, they start thinking

with that where-there's-smoke-there's

fire logic. They roust my ass outta

bed, ten o'clock in the morning.

Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half

to death. She thought they were gonna

take my ass away for sure.

MAX

The stewardess. Do you know her last

name?

ORDELL

(smiles)

Brown, Jackie Brown.

MAX

What does she do for you?

ORDELL

Who says she does anything for me?

She's my friend. When my friends get

into trouble, I like to help 'em out.

MAX

Beaumont worked for you.

ORDELL

That's what the police thought. I

told them I'm unemployed, how could I

have anybody work for me? Now I bail

out Jackie, I'm liable to have the

police on me again, huh? Wanting to

know was she doing things for me, was

she bringing me that money!

MAX

Was she?

ORDELL

Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-

client relationship? The lawyer can't

tell nothing he hears?

MAX

You're not my client until you get

busted and I bond you out.

ORDELL

If there's no - what do you call it -

confidentiality between us? Why would

I tell you anything?

MAX

Cause you want me to know what a

slick guy you are. You got

stewardesses bringing you fifty

grand.

ORDELL

Why would a stewardess bring me fifty

grand?

MAX

You want me to speculate on what you

do. I'd say you're in the drug

business, except the money's moving

in the wrong direction. Whatever

you're into, you seem to be getting

away with it, so more power to you.

Okay you want another bond, and you

want to move over the ten thousand

you put down on Beaumont to the

stewardess. That means paperwork. I

have to get a death certificate,

present it to the court, fill out a

receipt for return of bond

collateral, then type up another

application. An indemnity agreement -

ORDELL

- Jackie aint got time for all that

shit -

MAX

- I'm telling you what I have to do.

What you have to do, in case you

forgot, is come up with premium of a

thousand bucks.

ORDELL

I got it. I just don't got it on me.

MAX

Well, come back when you do, and I'll

bond out the stewardess.

ORDELL

Man, you know I'm good for it.

Thousand bucks ain't shit.

MAX

If I don't see it in front of me,

you're right. It ain't shit.

ORDELL

Man, you need to look at this with a

little compassion. Jackie ain't no

criminal. She ain't used to this

kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters

don't give a fuck - but for the

average citizen, coupla nights in

County fuck with your mind.

MAX

Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you

don't have a tab.

ORDELL

Just listen for a second. We got a

forty-year-old, gainfully employed

black woman, falsely accused -

MAX

Falsely accused? She didn't come back

from Mexico with cocaine on her?

ORDELL

Falsely accused of Intent. If she had

that shit - and mind you, I said "if"

- it was just her shit to get high

with.

MAX

Is white guilt supposed to make me

forget I'm running a business?

ORDELL

Okay, man. I got your money. But

don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'

favor.

MAX

Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation

officer. Karen's a good kid, but

she's mad at you, because you lied to

her. This business about your

grandmother's funeral

ANITA

I went. I did. I took my mother and

little brother.

MAX

But you didn't ask permission. You

broke a trust. If you had asked,

Karen probably would have let you.

I'm sure she would.

ANITA

I know. That's why I went.

MAX

But then you told her you were home.

ANITA

Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I

could go.

MAX

I don't know. Maybe it's a language

problem.

(getting stern)

Anita, you ever cause this much

heartache over something that could

easily be avoided, I'll never write

you again. You understand?

ANITA

I understand.

MAX

I mean it. I don't care how many

times your mother calls or how much

she cries.

ANITA

I understand.

MAX

Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."

ANITA

Yes, Max, I understand.

MAX

Dropping off and picking up. Dropping

of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,

Jackie.

ANITA

So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?

MAX

I'll call her.

ANITA

Won't forget?

MAX

I won't forget.

ANITA

Thanks, Max. See you later.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Max! Here she comes.

MAX

Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm

your bail bondsman.

MAX (CONT'D)

I can give you a lift home if you'd

like?

JACKIE

Okay.

JACKIE

Are you really a bail bondsman?

MAX

Who do you think I am?

MAX (CONT'D)

I gave you my card there.

JACKIE

Can I see your I.D.?

MAX

You're serious?

JACKIE

Who put up my bond? Ordell?

MAX

In cash.

JACKIE

Can we stop for cigarettes?

MAX

Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?

JACKIE

I don't think so.

MAX

It's okay. It's a cop hangout.

JACKIE

Couldn't we just stop at a seven-

eleven?

MAX

I thought you might want a drink?

JACKIE

I'd love one, but not there.

MAX

We could stop at the Hilton by the

airport.

JACKIE

Is it dark?

MAX

It's kind of a sports bar

JACKIE

That doesn't sound dark.

MAX

Why does it need to be dark?

JACKIE

'Cause I look like I just got outta

jail, that's why. You droppin' me off

at home, right? There's a place by

me.

MAX

Great.

CUT TO:

MAX

No thanks, I quit three years ago.

JACKIE

You gain weight?

MAX

Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back

on.

JACKIE

That's why I don't quit. If I can't

fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch

of a time gettin' my brand.

MAX

What's your brand?

JACKIE

Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.

They're hard to find here. I was

locked up with the last two getting

legal advice from a woman who was in

for bustin' her boyfriend's head open

with a baseball bat.

MAX

Was she helpful?

JACKIE

She was more helpful than the fuckin'

Public Defender.

(she takes a sip of wine)

I don't know - I guess what I need is

a lawyer, find out what my options

are.

MAX

You know, I figured out the other day

I've written something like' fifteen

thousand bonds since I've been in the

business. I'd say about eighty

percent of them were at least drug

related. If you want, I can help you

look at your options.

JACKIE

You're not tired of it?

MAX

(smiles)

I am, as a matter of fact.

MAX (CONT'D)

What have they told you?

JACKIE

So far I've been told I can cooperate

and get probation, maybe. Or, I can

stand mute and get as much as five

years. Does that sound right?

MAX

I'd say if you're tried and found

guilty you won't get more than a year

and a day. That's State time. Prison.

JACKIE

(under her breath)

Shit.

MAX

But they won't want to take you to

trial. They'll offer you simple

Possession, a few months of County

time, and a year or two probation.

(pointing to her drink)

How 'bout another?

JACKIE

Sure.

MAX

You know who put the dope in your

bag?

JACKIE

Yeah, but that's not what this was

about. They were fuckin waitin' for

my ass. They knew I had that money,

they even knew the amount. The one

who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,

Dargus, hardly even looked at it.

"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand

here. What would you say?" But all

they could do was threaten me and

hand me over to Customs, and I could

tell they didn't want to do that.

MAX

They wanted you to tell them what you

know.

JACKIE

I had 'em too. I burnt those two

Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.

Then their asses lucked out and found

that coke.

MAX

What did they want to know?

JACKIE

Who gave me the money and who I was

giving it to. And some guy they found

in a trunk with his head blown off.

Said it was him who told them 'bout

me.

ROWEN

Can I get you two some popcorn?

MAX

No, thanks.

MAX (CONT'D)

That would be Beaumont Livingston.

JACKIE

That's him. How do you know 'em?

MAX

I wrote him on Monday. They found him

dead on Tuesday.

JACKIE

Ordell pick up his bond?

MAX

Same as you. Ten thousand.

JACKIE

The federal agent kinda half hinted

Ordell might of done Beaumont.

MAX

You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,

but you didn't mention the Federal.

JACKIE

I didn't?

MAX

No, you didn't. What branch?

JACKIE

Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,

and Firearms.

MAX

He's the one who wants you.

JACKIE

It was the other guy who busted me.

MAX

'Cause if he busted you, you'd play

hell bonding out of federal court. He

doesn't want you mad at him, he wants

you to tell him what you know. He

uses you to get a line on Ordell,

make a case, then take him federal.

You know what Ordell's into?

JACKIE

I have a pretty good idea. Ordell

aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's

smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only

leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would

be interested in.

JACKIE

I used to bring over ten thousand at

a time. That's the legal limit, so I

never brought more than that.

MAX

How many trips did you make?

JACKIE

With ten thousand? Nine.

MAX

He's got that kinda money?

JACKIE

It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico

bank. But he's got a problem. He's -

what do you call it when you got

money, but don't have cash?

MAX

Cash poor?

JACKIE

That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on

me till I finally said okay. I'll

bring whatever fits in a nine-by-

twelve envelope. I got paid five

hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.

Walker, in Mexico gave me the

envelope.

MAX

If you knew bringing anything over

ten thousand was against the law, why

not pack a hundred grand?

JACKIE

Whatever it was had to fit in my bag

and not hit you in the face if the

bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my

problem. I gotta figure out a way to

either keep my job or get out of

trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't

leave the country I'm out of a job.

And if I don't got a job, I can't

hire a lawyer.

MAX

Ask A.T.F. They might give you

permission.

JACKIE

Yeah, if I cooperate.

MAX

Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're

gonna have to give 'em something.

JACKIE

But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's

name - I don't really know shit about

what he does or how he does it - That

don't give me much to bargain with.

MAX

Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.

Show a willingness to be helpful. You

want to stay out of jail, don't you?

MAX (CONT'D)

What'dya think?

JACKIE

I think maybe I have more options

than I thought.

DISSOLVE TO:

ORDELL

How you doing, Ms. Jackie?

JACKIE

I was expecting you. Come in.

ORDELL

You got some booze?

JACKIE

I got some vodka in the freezer.

ORDELL

Got some o.j.?

JACKIE

Yeah.

ORDELL

Well, then, why don't you be a good

hostess and make me a screwdriver?

JACKIE

Sure.

ORDELL

You gonna thank me?

JACKIE

For what?

ORDELL

Who you think got your ass outta

jail?

JACKIE

The same guy who put me in, thanks a

lot.

ORDELL

Hey, you get caught with blow, that's

our business.

JACKIE

It wasn't mine.

ORDELL

Oh, shit. I bet it was that present

Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.

Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in

there if you didn't. Oh, man, that

shit's uncalled for, baby, and I

apologize. I 'magine they asked you a

shitload of questions about it, huh?

All that money, want to know where

you got it?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

I'magine they asked who you givin' it

to, too.

JACKIE

They asked.

ORDELL

And what was your answer?

JACKIE

I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

ORDELL

You positive about that? You weren't

nervous and let something slip by

mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I

just gotta know.

JACKIE

You're not asking the right

questions.

JACKIE

Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL

I knew it.

JACKIE

And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.

ORDELL

Yeah?

JACKIE

I didn't tell 'em anything.

ORDELL

My name come up?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

You say anything about me?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Well, that's mighty honorable of you.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

This fella Beaumont, they say what

happened to him?

JACKIE

They told me.

ORDELL

Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at

Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of

what he might say to keep from doin

some time. I'magine from time-to-time

they asked you a whole shitload of

questions. And you didn't give 'em no

answer?

ORDELL

You scared of me?

ORDELL

You got a reason to be nervous with

me?

MAX

Where is it?

ORDELL

Is that what I think it is?

JACKIE

What do you think it is?

ORDELL

I think it's a gun pressing against

my dick.

JACKIE

You thought right... Now take your

hands from around my throat, nigga.

ORDELL

What the hell you doin'?

JACKIE

Shut your ass up and grab the wall!

ORDELL

Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do

with you. I just carry that. You been

listenin' to them cops too much.

JACKIE

The cops didn't try and strangle my

ass.

ORDELL

Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with

you.

JACKIE

Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm

gonna unload both these

motherfuckers, you don't do what I

tell you. Understand what I'm saying?

ORDELL

Baby, I ain't come here -

JACKIE

I said, you understand what I'm

saying

ORDELL

I understand woman, damn!

JACKIE

Go sit over in that chair.

ORDELL

I'm tellin' you, those cops been

fuckin' wit your mind. They turn

black against black, that's how they

do.

JACKIE

Shut your raggedy ass up and sit

down.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Put both hands behind our head.

ORDELL

This shits gettin silly now...

JACKIE

I gotta tell you to shut up one more

time, I'm gonna shut you up.

ORDELL

I just came here to talk.

JACKIE

Way I see it, me and you only got one

thing to talk about. What you willing

to do for me?

ORDELL

Well, I can get you a good lawyer -

JACKIE

Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or

later they're gonna get around to

offering me a plea deal, and you know

that. That's why you came here to

kill me.

ORDELL

- Baby, I didn't -

JACKIE

- It's okay. I forgive you. Now,

let's say if I tell on you, I walk.

And if I don't, I go to jail.

ORDELL

Yeah?

JACKIE

One hundred thousand put in an escrow

account in my name, if I'm convicted

up to a year, or put on probation. If

I have to do more than a year, you

pay another hundred thousand.

ORDELL

I got a problem...

JACKIE

All your money's in Mexico.

ORDELL

Yeah.

JACKIE

I been thinkin about that, too, and I

got me a idea.

TIME CUT:

JACKIE

I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and

tell you if it's on.

ORDELL (O.S.)

Talk to you tomorrow.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON:

JACKIE

You want your gun, don't you? Come

in. I'll go get it.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I

asked to borrow it you'd say no.

You'd have to. Would you like some

coffee?

MAX

If you're having some.

JACKIE

I am. Have a seat.

MAX

You get a chance to use it?

JACKIE

I felt a lot safer having it. My milk

went bad when I was in jail.

MAX

Black's fine.

MAX (CONT'D)

You want to hang on to it awhile? It

wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -

JACKIE

Thanks, but I have my own now.

MAX

You went out this morning and bought

a gun?

JACKIE

What, I couldn't hear you?

MAX

You went out this morning and bought

a gun.

JACKIE

Let's just say I got one, okay?

MAX

Somebody loan it to you?

JACKIE

Yeah.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Want to hear some music?

MAX

Sure.

JACKIE

I couldn't wait till I got home last

night and wash my hair.

MAX

It looks nice.

MAX (CONT'D)

You never got into the whole CD

revolution?

JACKIE

I got a few. But I can't afford to

start all over again. I got too much

time and money invested in my

records.

MAX

Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on

records.

JACKIE

I don't buy new stuff that often.

MAX

This is pretty.

JACKIE

Uh-huh.

MAX

Who is this?

JACKIE

The Delfonics.

MAX

'76?

JACKIE

'74, I think.

MAX

It's nice.

JACKIE

I called in sick this morning. As far

as the airline knows, I'm still

available.

MAX

Are you?

JACKIE

I don't know yet. 'm going to talk

with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do

what you suggested. Offer to help and

see what happens.

MAX

What I meant was have a lawyer do the

negotiating for you.

JACKIE

I want to talk to them first. I know

more now about Ordell's money.

MAX

Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one

who wants you, that'll only interest

him up to a point.

JACKIE

It's a lot of money. About a half-a-

million dollars. All of it in Cabo in

safe deposit boxes and more comin in.

MAX

How'd you find that out?

JACKIE

He told me last night.

MAX

He called you?

JACKIE

He came by.

MAX

What?... What'd you do?

JACKIE

We talked.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

He had his doubts at first. But he's

always trusted me an wants more than

anything to believe he still can.

MAX

Why?

JACKIE

He needs me. Without me all that

money is just gonna sit over there in

Cabo. Sugar?

MAX

No thanks. There's gotta be other

ways to get it out.

JACKIE

Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever

used. He can't trust his other

people. They're crooks. He can try

bringing I in himself, but Ordell

sure don't want to go through no

Customs line. Either he recruits

another Cabo stewardess, or he

continues to trust me. I made him

feel he still can.

MAX

How do you get it out?

JACKIE

Same way I been don', but first they

got to let me go back to work.

MAX

You're gonna offer to set him up?

JACKIE

If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck

'em.

MAX

It's very possible Ordell's killed

somebody.

JACKIE

I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't

doin' that probation thing again.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

How do you feel about getting old?

MAX

You're not old. You look great.

JACKIE

I'm asking how you feel. Does it

bother you?

MAX

It's not really something I think

about.

JACKIE

Really?

MAX

Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my

hair. It started falling out ten

years ago. So I did something about

it.

JACKIE

How'd you feel about it?

MAX

I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of

done it, I did it to feel better

about myself, and I do. When I look

in the mirror it looks like me.

JACKIE

It's different with men.

MAX

You know, I can't really feel too

sorry for you in that department.

MAX (CONT'D)

In fact, I'd make a bet that except

possibly for an Afro - you look

exactly the same as you did at twenty

nine.

JACKIE

My ass ain't the same.

MAX

Bigger?

JACKIE

Yeah.

MAX

Nothin wrong with that.

MAX (CONT'D)

Does something else worry you?

JACKIE

I just feel like I'm always starting

over. You said how many bonds you

wrote?

MAX

Fifteen thousand.

JACKIE

Well, I've flown seven million miles.

And I've been waitin' on people

almost twenty years. The best job I

could get after my bust was Cabo Air,

which is about the worst job you can

get in this industry. I make about

sixteen thousand, with retirement

benefits , ain't worth a damn. And

now with this arrest hanging over my

head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I

gotta start all over again, but I got

nothin to start over with. I'll be

stuck with whatever I can get. And

that scares me more than Ordell.

DISSOLVE TO:

DARGUS (O.S.)

Come in.

DARGUS (CONT'D)

Great, you're here.

NICOLET

Hey, Jackie.

DARGUS

Let me have a word outside with Agent

Nicolet for a moment?

JACKIE

Take your time.

DARGUS

Thanks.

NICOLET

Well just be a minute.

JACKIE

Can I smoke?

DARGUS

Go ahead.

NICOLET

What's going on?

DARGUS

She wants to make a deal.

NICOLET

She sound scared?

DARGUS

She almost sounds scared.

NICOLET

What's she want?

DARGUS

She wants to go back to work.

NICOLET

What's she willing to give us?

DARGUS

She hasn't one into specifics yet,

she's been waiting for you.

NICOLET

She knows it's my case?

DARGUS

She ain't said it, but she's not

stupid, she knows it's you who wants

her.

NICOLET

Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell

me, what can we do for you?

JACKIE

I need permission to leave the

country so I keep my job.

NICOLET

We can look into that.

JACKIE

I need it tomorrow. If I don't show

up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.

NICOLET

You know what we want.

JACKIE

If I'm working, I can help you.

DARGUS

Help us do what?

JACKIE

Help you get Ordell Robbie.

NICOLET

Oh, so now you know him?

JACKIE

You never asked me if I did or not.

DARGUS

But now you're telling us now you do.

JACKIE

'Course I do - I deliver money for

him.

NICOLET

No shit. You know how he makes hi

money?

JACKIE

He sells guns.

NICOLET

You ever see him sell guns?

JACKIE

No.

NICOLET

Then how do you know he sells guns?

JACKIE

He told me. Besides, why else would

an A.T.F. man be after him?

NICOLET

How can you help us?

JACKIE

Short of wearing a wire, I'll do

everything I can to help you throw

his ass in jail. And in exchange for

my help, I need permission to leave

the country and immunity.

DARGUS

You don't want much, do you?

JACKIE

Can you do it or not?

DARGUS

(to Nicolet)

It's your call.

NICOLE

It's possible.

FADE TO BLACK

CUT TO:

ORDELL

We're back.

MELANIE

'Ola!

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got

some new clothes.

ORDELL

We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy

running around lookin' like a bum on

the street.

LOUIS

I didn't look like a bum.

ORDELL

But you did have a Salvation Army-

thing going.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Goddam, girl. You gettin' high

already. It's only two o'clock.

MELANIE

It's that late?

ORDELL

Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too

much of that shit. That shit robs you

of your ambition.

MELANIE

Not if your ambition is to get high

and watch TV.

ORDELL

You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,

ain't ya.

(he moves towards the

phone - to Melanie)

Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.

ORDELL

Hello.

(pause)

Hey, Jackie...

(throwing a hard look at

Melanie)

MELANIE

I was gonna tell you...

ORDELL

No, not on the phone, let's meet

somewhere. But you gotta make sure

they ain't followin' you...

LOUIS

Is it ready to go?

MELANIE

Yeah, there's another hit left.

JACKIE

The Cockatoo Inn.

ORDELL

The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?

JACKIE

It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and

Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red

brick...

ORDELL

Oh, wait, you mean that place that

has the big sign with a rooster on

it?

JACKIE

It's a cockatoo.

MELANIE

You okay?

LOUIS

Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't

smoke or laugh now it seems without

coughing.

MELANIE

Coughing opens up the capillaries.

When you cough, you're getting air -

in this case smoke - to parts of the

lung that don't normally get used.

Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My

dad coughs when he smokes all the

time.

ORDELL

(to Louis)

Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.

So since you like gettin' high so

much, why don't you stay here with

Melanie, get high, and watch

cartoons?

LOUIS

Way ahead of you.

ORDELL

So you just watch this for the next

three hours, and I'll be back. Then,

when I'm through with all my

business, I'll get high. I get high

at night. Walk me to the door, space

girl.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Hope you don't mind keeping him

company.

MELANIE

No problem.

ORDELL

Try not to rip his clothes off 'em

they're new.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

I'll be back in an hour, man. Just

hang with Mel.

MELANIE

Want a Metrix?

LOUIS

What's a Metrix?

MELANIE

It's like this major meal in a shake

you drink instead of having a big

meal.

LOUIS

It's a diet thing?

MELANIE

No, it's what body builders drink to

beef up.

LOUIS

No thanks.

LOUIS

How old were you here?

MELANIE

Which one?

LOUIS

The roller disco one.

MELANIE

Fourteen.

LOUIS

You're fourteen years old here?

MELANIE

Yeah.

LOUIS

I thought you were sixteen.

MELANIE

I was pretty much the same height now

as I was then.

LOUIS

Were you a disco girl?

MELANIE

Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,

I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to

discos.

LOUIS

So where did you go?

MELANIE

The beach. Or get high, drop acid at

a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.

girl. I hated disco.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

That was taken at a place called

"Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were

you in L.A. back then?

LOUIS

No.

MELANIE

Where were you?

LOUIS

Detroit.

MELANIE

With Ordell?

LOUIS

We had done time together already.

MELANIE

Were you a disco guy?

LOUIS

No.

MELANIE

C'mon, don't lie.

LOUIS

I don't like dancing.

MELANIE

Did you ever go I one?

LOUIS

I went to a few just to meet women.

But I don't like to dance, and it's

so fuckin; loud. During that whole

scene I just drank in bars.

(he points to the cut

picture)

Who didn't make the cut?

MELANIE

That's a picture of me in Japan.

LOUIS

You been to Japan?

MELANIE

I lived there for about nine months.

LOUIS

You lived in Japan, when?

MELANIE

About five years ago.

LOUIS

Who's arm is that?

MELANIE

That's the guy I lived with... his

name was... Hir.Hirosh.

LOUIS

Must of made quite an impression.

MEALINE

I never got to know him, really. I

couldn't speak Japanese, and his

English was terrible. But I couldn't

say anything, because his English was

better than my Japanese.

LOUIS

That sounds like a problem.

MELANIE

Not really. We didn't have much to

say to each other anyway. I never got

to know him that well, but I knew

enough to know I wasn't missing much.

I keep that, because of all the

fuckin' time I was there, that's the

only picture I got of me in Japan.

(she points beyond her

shoulder)

That's Japan.

MELANIE

Wanna fuck?

LOUIS

Sure.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MELANIE

That was fun.

LOUIS

Yeah, that really hit the spot.

MELANIE (O.S.)

Now that's over, let's get to know

each other.

ORDELL

I gotta remember this place. This is

all right. Two minutes from your

crib, ten minutes from your work. Not

bad...

FLOYD

What's your drink, brother?

ORDELL

Screwdriver.

FLOYD

(to Jackie)

How you doin'?

JACKIE

I'm fine.

FLOYD

Yes, you are.

ORDELL

I bet you come here on a Saturday

night, you need nigga repellent keep

'em off your ass.

JACKIE

I do okay.

ORDELL

You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I

bet you do a damn sight better than

okay. You think anybody followed you?

JACKIE

I don't think so, but it don't really

matter. They know I'm meeting you.

ORDELL

How the fuck they know that?

JACKIE

I told them.

FLOYD

Three twenty-five.

ORDELL

Keep it.

FLOYD

Thank you, sir.

ORDELL

(to Jackie)

You told em? You told em it's me?

JACKIE

They already know it's you.

ORDELL

Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta

confirm it!

JACKIE

Look, the only way I can get

permission to fly is if I agree to

help them. Which is what I have to

appear to be doing. So I give them

something they already know. You.

ORDELL

Didja tell 'em anything else?

JACKIE

I told them you got a half a million

dollars in Mexico, and you want me to

bring it here.

ORDELL

You told them that?

JACKIE

It's true, isn't it?

ORDELL

What the fuck's that got to do with

it?

JACKIE

They know I'm delivering for you. I

mention the half-million - they don't

give a fuck about that - They want

you with guns. So I say, well, if you

want proof he's getting paid for

selling them, let me bring the money

in.

ORDELL

What did they say?

JACKIE

Yes.

CUT TO:

MELANI

... so first he tries to get into the

cocaine business but realizes right

away that shit's too competitive.

Piss the wrong person off, you get

shot. So he says, fuck that - moves

over to guns. You can sell guns

wherever there's a demand. No one

gives a shit. He acts like he's this

big international arms dealer, when,

come on, the only people he ever sold

to were dopers.

LOUIS

He seems to be making out.

MELANIE

Is it dead?

LOUIS

Yeah.

MELANIE

Well, so far he is. But you have to

admit he's not too bright.

LOUIS

I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

MELANIE

He moves his lips when he reads, what

does that tell ya. Let's say he's

streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's

still a fuck-up.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

He killed a man worked for him the

other night.

LOUIS

So what are you trying to tell me? I

should get out of here?

MELANIE

That's not what I'm saying at all.

(pause) You know where he went?

LOUIS

No.

MELANIE

He went to meet that stewardess.

LOUIS

Does that bother you?

MELANIE

Please.

LOUIS

You live with him.

MELANIE

I live here. He drops in and out. He

tell you about that half-million

dollars he's got in Mexico?

LOUIS

Uh-huh?

MELANIE

Course he did, he tells everybody

who'll listen. That's what he's doin'

with this stewardess. He's scheming

how he can get it over here.

LOUIS

And your point is?

MELANIE

Let him and that stewardess get that

money over here...

LOUIS

Uh-huh?

MELANI

... and just take it from him.

JACKI

... I make two deliveries. The first

one with ten thousand, like a dry

run. They watch it. See how it works.

Then we do a second delivery, when I

bring in the half mill.

ORDELL

Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I

ain't goin anywhere near that money.

JACKIE

You don't have to. I told 'em you're

real careful. You never pick up money

yourself. You always send someone,

and I never know who it is.

ORDELL

That's a good idea.

JACKIE

If you just listen, you'll see it's a

damn good idea. The first time I do

it they're lurking about. They see me

hand the ten thousand to someone.

ORDELL

Who?

JACKIE

I don't know. One of your friends.

ORDELL

A woman.

JACKIE

If you want.

ORDELL

Yeah, I think a woman.

JACKIE

The next trip, when I come with all

the money, it'll look like I hand it

to the same one I did before...

ORDELL

But you don't?

JACKIE

No, I give it to someone else first.

ORDELL

And they follow the wrong one

thinkin' she's bringing it to me.

JACKIE

That's the idea.

ORDELL

So we need two people, two women.

JACKIE

Can you cover that?

ORDELL

I got the woman covered. Where you

thinkin' about doin' this?

JACKIE

I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In

the food court.

ORDELL

I suppose you see a piece of this for

yourself?

JACKIE

Well, it's my plan. We're in this

together.

ORDELL

Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't

need me a partner.

JACKIE

I ain't your partner, I'm your

manager. I'm managing to get your

money out of Mexico, into America, in

your hands, and I'm managing to do

all this under the nose of the cops.

That makes me your manager, and

managers get fifteen percent.

ORDELL

Managers get ten percent.

JACKIE

That's an agent. Manager's get

fifteen percent.

ORDELL

I'll give ya ten.

JACKIE

Plus the same deal as before.

ORDELL

I can do that.

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)

You have on message. Sent at 8:06

P.M.

MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just

calling to find out how everything

went today with A.T.F. If you want to

call me, my home number is 555-6788,

or you can reach me at my office,

which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on

the card I gave you when we first met

- I don't know if you still have that

- but it's on it - Oh, let me give

you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.

Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope

everything's well. Bye-bye.

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)

End of message.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON:

JACKIE

The money's in a Broadway shopping

bag. I get some food, and sit down

here in the food court. Then your

girl comes - you got somebody yet?

ORDELL

Uh-huh.

JACKIE

Who?

ORDELL

What'd you care?

JACKIE

Look, it's my ass facin' the

penitentiary. You send some hard-

headed roc whore, and she fucks

things up.

ORDELL

I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The

woman's cool, I promise.

JACKIE

Don't forget your bag.

MAX

walks into the food court. He stands

looking a all the international fast

food choices in front of him. As he

tries to decide, he hears from behind

him;

JACKIE (O.S.)

Max.

MAX

Well, hello.

JACKIE

Surprise.

MAX

I walked right past you.

JACKIE

I know, ignoring me. What're you up

to?

MAX

Catching a movie.

JACKIE

What'd ya see?

MAX

"American Prseident"

JACKIE

How was it?

MAX

Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening

are goin steady.

JACKIE

Oh, are you? Does she know that?

MAX

No...

(sitting down at the

table)

... I don't believe she's ever heard

of me. But that doesn't mean we're

not going steady.

ORDELL

(to himself)

What's up with this shit.

MAX

I think falling in live with movie

stars is something that happens to a

man as he gets older.

JACKIE

Does it happen to all men?

MAX

Well, I'd never be so bold as to

speak for all men, but as or myself

and a few of my friends, that's

definitely the case. There's a lot of

actresses out there you like, and

there's some you have crushes on. But

there's always one who you love. And

with her it's sorta like going

steady.

JACKIE

And Annette's it for you?

MAX

For now. These relationships never

last too long.

JACKIE

That's a goddam man for ya. Can't

even be faithful to a fuckin' movie

star.

JACKIE

Who was your girl before Annette?

MAX

Sandra Bullock. You know her?

JACKIE

Yeah, she's the girl who drove the

bus in "Speed." She's cute.

MAX

She's adorable. But I had to end it.

JACKIE

Why?

MAX

I'm old enough to be her father.

JACKIE

How old's Annette?

MAX

I don't care.

MAX

What're you, a bag lady?

JACKIE

I go back to work tomorrow.

MAX

You talk them into it?

JACKIE

They seem to like the idea.

MAX

Bring the money in and they follow

it?

JACKIE

Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.

Put the money in a shopping bag and

hand it to someone I meet here.

MAX

You don't actually do it that way?

JACKIE

He always just picked it up at my

place. But with A.T.F. involved, I

want to stage it. You know, make it

look more intriguing, like we know

what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's

up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to

follow the shopping bag.

MAX

Make the delivery somewhere in the

mall.

JACKIE

Right around here, in the food court.

MAX

Sit down, leave the bag under the

table?

MAX (CONT'D)

Will Ordell go for that?

JACKIE

I'm helping him bring his money into

America. He loves the idea. You just

missed him.

MAX

He was here?

JACKIE

Yeah, we were goin' over everything.

That's why all the bags.

MAX

I called you last night.

JACKIE

I know, I got your message. Ray

wanted to have dinner. He wanted to

talk about the sting we're plotting.

That's what he calls it. A sting.

He's being real nice to me.

MAX

You think he's got a thing for you?

JACKIE

Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be

something like he wants the money for

himself.

MAX

I don't follow your logic. What does

his being nice to you have to do with

him wanting Ordell's money?

JACKIE

He's setting me up to make a

proposition.

MAX

I see.

JACKIE

You don't propose something like that

unless you're pretty sure the other

person's into it.

MAX

Has he hinted around?

JACKIE

Not really. But I knew this narcotics

cop one time. Told me that in a raid,

the whole package never gets back to

the station. His exact words.

MAX

You know some interesting people.

JACKIE

We weren't bullshittin' either,

'cause later he was suspended and

forced to retire.

MAX

Has Nicolet told you any colorful

stories like that?

JACKIE

He tries to act cool.

MAX

No harm in that. He's a young guy

havin' fun being a cop. I know the

type, trust me on this. He's more

interested in Ordell than the money.

If he's gonna do anything suspect,

it'll be cutting corners to get the

conviction; but he wouldn't walk off

with the money. It's evidence.

JACKIE

What about you Max?

MAX

What? If I was in Nicolet's place?

JACKIE

No, I mean you, right now. Not it you

were somebody else.

MAX

If I saw a way to walk off with a

shopping bag full of money, would I

take it?

JACKIE

You know where it came from. It's not

like it's anybody's life savings. It

wouldn't even be missed.

MAX

A half-a-million dollars will always

be missed.

JACKIE

You're avoiding the question.

MAX

Okay, sure. I might be tempted.

Especially now, since I'm getting out

of the bail bonds business.

MAX

I have to stand behind all my active

bonds, but I'm not writing any new

ones.

JACKIE

Why?

MAX

A lot of reasons. But the main one

would be I'm tired of it.

JACKIE

When did you decide?

MAX

It's been a long time coming. I

finally made up my mind - I guess it

was Thursday.

MAX

Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail

bondsman.

JACKIE

The day you got me out of jail?

MAX

Yeah, that night I went to pick up a

guy. I hear he's staying at this

house, so I sneak in, wait for him to

come home.

JACKIE

Wait a minute. After we were together

you went and snuck into a guy's

house?

MAX

Uh-huh.

MAX (V.O.)

I dropped you off...

MAX (V.O.)

Went to my office, found out you took

my gun...

MAX (V.O.)

Got another gun and a stun gun...

MAX

And went to this guy's house in El

Monte, and I waited for him.

JACKIE

What do you do when he comes home?

MAX

Shoot him with the stun gun. While

he's incapacitated, cuff him, take

'em to County.

JACKIE

You do that?

MAX

That's my job.

JACKIE

Did you do it that night?

MAX

He never came home. But I'm sitting

on the couch, in the dark, holding my

stun gun and the whole house smells

of mildew - So after a couple hours I

think, "What am I doing here?

Nineteen years of this shit? So I

made up my mind, that's it.

JACKIE

And is that it?

MAX

More or less.

JACKIE

I'm not sure you answered my

question.

MAX

Which one?

JACKIE

If you had a chance, unemployed now,

to walk off with a half-million

dollars, would you take it?

MAX

I believe I said I'd be tempted.

MAX

Don't even think about it. You could

get yourself killed go to prison...

JACKIE

What if I've figured a way?

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP:

JACKIE

Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye

bye... Bye bye... Goodbye

NICOLET

We gotta stop meeting this way.

DARGUS

How was your flight?

JACKIE

Fine.

DARGUS

Bet you're happy to be working again.

NICOLET

This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,

Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money

exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,

July 4th 1997. The location is the

parking structure at LAX.

JACKIE

What are you doing?

NICOLET

I'm recording this.

JACKIE

I thought you were going to let this

one through.

DARGUS

We are. Don't worry about it.

NICOLET

Every step of this goes in my report.

(back to report voice)

I am now taking a manila envelope

from the subject's flight bag.

NICOLET (CONT'D)

The envelope contains currency... all

the same denomination, one-hundred-

dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.

DARGUS

What time do you have to be there?

JACKIE

Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.

DARGUS

What's her name?

JACKIE

He wouldn't say. You gonna follow

her?

DARGUS

She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

JACKIE

But you're not going to stop her?

NICOLET

The envelope contains ten thousand

dollars. The subject will be

delivering the currency in a...

JACKIE

A Broadway shopping bag.

NICOLET

A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag

with handles and brown lettering.

MAX

CafS mocha.

BUSTA CAP GIRL

You want whipped cream on that?

MAX

No, thanks.

FLASH ON:

JACKIE

Think of it as money that shouldn't

even be here. I mean does anybody

have a right to it?

MAX

The feds. It's evidence.

JACKIE

It may be evidence once they get

their hands on it, but right now it's

only money.

YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Is this seat taken?

JACKIE

Have a seat.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

You're hungry?

YOUNG GIRL

Yes'm.

JACKIE

Put your bag on the floor, okay?

Under the table, right next to mine.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Then when I leave, well, you know.

What's your name?

YOUNG GIRL

Sherona?

JACKIE

Go ahead, start eating.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Would it bother you if I smoked?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Sheronda, can I ask you a question?

Are you and Ordell married?

SHERONDA

He say we like the same thing as

married.

JACKIE

Do you live together?

SHERONDA

Most of the times.

JACKIE

Not every day?

SHERONDA

Sometimes every day, for a while.

JACKIE

Then you don't see him for a few

days?

SHERONDA

Yes'm.

JACKIE

You know what's in the bag you're

taking?

SHERONDA

He say is a surprise.

JACKIE

Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking

to you.

JACKIE

You said it yourself. Ray wants

Ordell, he don't give a shit about

the money. Money won't convict him,

guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in

their lap, they take it. If they know

they got it, they'll look for it...

but if they don't...

MAX

You're rationalizing.

JACKIE

That's what you do to go through with

the shit you start. You rationalize.

I can do this, Max, I know I can. But

I can't do it without you.

MAX

(to himself)

It could work... If she handles the

cops right, I could work...

CUT TO:

ORDELL

Check this out.

LOUIS

How much is there?

ORDELL

Over half-million dollars worth of

merchandise.

LOUIS

Can I ask you about Melanie?

ORDELL

Sure.

LOUIS

What's your relationship?

ORDELL

She one of the women I got set up. I

got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent

Simone a small house in Compton, and

about four blocks away I got me this

nineteen-year-old country girl named

Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a

bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,

country as a chicken coop. Took her

to my house in Compton, told her it

was Hollywood.

LOUIS

She believed you?

ORDELL

Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,

Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's

ever been, anyway.

LOUIS

Do you trust Melanie?

ORDELL

If this is about you fucked Melanie,

I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.

I leave you alone with a bitch like

Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that

twenty minutes after I'm out the

door. So say "thank you" and I'll

tell you, "you're welcome."

LOUIS

That's not what I meant when I asked

did you trust her.

ORDELL

She tryin' to work your ass against

me, ain't she?

LOUIS

Yep.

ORDELL

You didn't even hafta say it. I know

the woman.

LOUIS

Well, why the fuck keep her around?

ORDELL

(smiling)

'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.

She can't do me no harm. Fact she

think she can play you against me

shows how little she knows. You could

teach that bitch for days how it is

'tween me an you, she never

understand a damn word.

LOUIS

Why do you let someone know your

business you can't trust?

ORDELL

I don't hafta trust her, I know her.

LOUIS

What does that mean?

ORDELL

You can't trust Melanie. But you can

always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

LOUIS

I still don't understand why you keep

her around.

ORDELL

I told you, man.

(smiling)

She my fine little surfer gal.

MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

(coming out of it)

What?

JACKIE

It's Jackie.

ORDEL

... Now she's gonna pout...

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

She gonna hafta find her sandals...

find her bag... find her

sunglasses... take twenty damn

minutes get her ass out the door.

(to Jackie)

Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -

Jackie. And the chick stompin' around

in the other room is Melanie.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

You have a nice time, hear?

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Drink?

JACKIE

I need to talk to you alone.

JACKIE

I don't want no more fuckin'

surprises. We do this the way I laid

it out, or we don't do it at all.

ORDELL

What the hell you talkin' bout?

JACKIE

Sheronda passin' the money onto

someone else, that's what the hell

I'm talkin' 'bout.

ORDELL

How do you know she did that?

JACKIE

I was there, I saw her do it.

ORDELL

Well, you weren't supposed to be

there.

JACKIE

I know, but I hung around, 'cause I

figured you'd try an' pull some shit

like this.

ORDELL

Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'

no shit. It's my money, I can do

whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.

JACKIE

Not when it's my ass on the line you

don't. We do this my way or fuck it.

ORDELL

Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It

ain't no big thing. The woman you saw

was my friend, Simone. She's the one

gonna be receiving the money, so I

just wanted her to see how it works.

She'll be here any minute. Nice

woman, you'll like her.

ORDELL

Louis, call Simone and tell her to

get her tail over here. We're waitin'

on her ass.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I

can't tempt you?

JACKIE

Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the

airport and mark the bills.

ORDELL

Man, I don't like that part.

JACKIE

It washes off. I tell them we're

doing it the same way as before.

They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the

idea of leaving her for a fall.

ORDELL

She won't have no problems 'cause she

don't know nothin'.

JACKIE

Are you sure she don' know about the

money?

ORDELL

She don't know shit about the money.

JACKIE

What does she think she's gettin?

ORDELL

I told her this is a game us rich

folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a

scavenger hunt. She didn't know what

that was neither.

(to Louis)

No answer?

LOUIS

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

Hang it up, she's on her way. You

gotta listen to this. This involves

you.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

No, you gonna give her a

Robinson's/May bag this time?

JACKIE

Right, the one Simone gives me.

Simone and I'll make the switch at

Robinson's/May. She knows what I look

like?

ORDELL

She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone

goes to the dress department with her

Robinson's/May bag.

JACKIE

Designer clothes.

ORDELL

She waits for you to go in the place

where you try things on.

JACKIE

The fitting room. There's a sign over

the door.

LOUIS

Why we doin' I there?

JACKIE

I have a hunch they'll be watchin'

me. We can't risk switching bags out

in the open or even in the dining

area. That's why it has to be a

woman, 'cause we do the switch in the

fitting room.

ORDELL

So you come out with her

Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.

Simone peeks out, waits for my man

Louis here to give her a signal

nobody's watchin'. She leaves the

store, gets in her car - mission

accomplished.

JACKIE

Where you gonna be during all this?

ORDELL

I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar

In downtown L.A. till my man over

here calls me and gives me the O.K.

sign.

JACKIE

I gotta go.

ORDELL

Who's paging you?

JACKIE

Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

ORDELL

That works on my nerves, you bein' so

buddy-buddy with him.

JACKIE

If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now

once I deliver I'll have to trust

you.

ORDELL

Well, I've been trusting you all this

time, haven't I? We agreed on ten

percent of what you bring in and

that's what you gonna get.

JACKIE

And a hundred thousand if I go to

jail.

ORDELL

We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't

gonna screw you. You haven't told me

where I put it for you.

JACKIE

Give it to the bail bondsman, Max

Cherry. He'll take care of it.

ORDELL

Max Cherry? You and him friends now?

You tell him about this shit?

JACKIE

He won't know where the money came

from. Only that it's money.

ORDELL

Don't you know all them bail bondsmen

are crooks...

JACKIE

Do you have a phone?

WANDA

Yeah, it's in the back.

JACKIE

Thanks.

MELANIE (O.S.)

Hey!

JACKIE

Oh, hi.

MELANIE

Buy ya a beer?

JACKIE

I'm waiting for the phone.

MELANIE

Good luck. That guy's been in there

since I got here.

JACKIE

Well, I guess I better look for

another one, then. Thanks, anyway.

MELANIE

I know what you and Ordell got goin'.

You sit down and have a beer with me.

I'll tell you a secret.

JACKIE

Sure.

MELANIE

Great...

(calling to the

bartender)

... Wanda!

WANDA

What?

MELANIE

This lady is thirsty.

WANDA

What do you want?

MELANIE

What's on tap?

WANDA

Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and

Killian's Red.

JACKIE

Killian's.

MELANIE

Better get me another Sam's.

(to Jackie)

Join me in a Jaeger shot?

JACKIE

Uh-uh.

MELANIE

Gimme one anyway.

WANDA

You got it.

JACKIE

How long you been with Ordell?

MELANIE

This time? Almost a year. I've known

him forever.

JACKIE

What were you two fighting about?

MELANIE

He told me to go outside.

(imitating Ordell's

voice)

"You may leave us now." It's all part

of his pathetic attempt to be "the

man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about

Ordell.

JACKIE

That coke was yours, wasn't it?

MELANIE

Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about

that. I hope they don't come down on

you on my account. Ordell shoulda

told you it was in your bag.

WANDA

Seven dollars.

JACKIE

He said he didn't know about it.

MELANIE

(digging in her purse)

You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess

you have to trust him.

(pulls out a ten)

I'd have second thoughts on that, but

then I know 'em.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

He killed a guy who works for him the

other day.

JACKIE

Beaumont Livingston?

MELANIE

You already knew that?

JACKIE

Kinda.

MELANIE

So tell me. Having all that money in

your flight bag - Is it tempting?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to

carry in ten thousand dollars, that

would be the last motherfuckin' time

he saw me. The next trip you're gonna

have over half-a-million. If you

thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure

as hell wouldn't blame you.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

You think I'm kidding?

JACKIE

Dreaming.

MELANIE

You know how easy it would be? He

won't be anywhere near that mall.

Pull one more switch, up front.

That's it. half-a-million dollars.

Need help?

JACKIE

(smiling)

Keep it between us girls?

MELANIE

What's that fucker ever done for us?

JACKIE

(getting off the

barstool)

I don't think so, but thanks for the

beer.

MELANIE

(softly under her breath)

Chicken shit.

JACKIE

Ordell has a white guy working for

him named Louis.

NICOLET

You two meet?

JACKIE

This afternoon before I came here. He

was with Ordell at an apartment in

Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he

lives there, but I can find out.

NICOLET

You talk to him?

JACKIE

Not really.

NICOLET

His full name is Louis Gara. He just

got out from serving four years in

Susanville.

JACKIE

What for?

NICOLET

Bank robbery? Do you know what he

does for Ordell?

JACKIE

I imagine shit needs to be done.

NICOLET

We've been following Mr. Gara, and

he's definitely working for Ordell.

FLASH ON:

NICOLET (V.O.)

They served two years together almost

twenty years ago in Soledad. But he

doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.

Ordell's got him staying at a house

in.

NICOLET (V.O.)

... Compton with a fifty-six-year-

old petty thief - woman named Simone

Hawkins.

NICOLET

Ever meet her, or they talk about

her?

JACKIE

Not yet.

NICOLET

Who's the other one?

JACKIE

White girl named Melanie Ralston.

Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

NICOLET

What's her story?

JACKIE

It was her coke I got busted with.

She knows everything, but she's not

part of it, and she's pissed cause

she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't

even let her stay at the meeting. She

tried to talk me into ripping off

Ordell.

NICOLET

And splittin' with her?

JACKIE

I'm sure that was the idea.

NICOLET

What did you say?

JACKIE

I smiled and walked away. She also

told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

NICOLET

She told you that?

JACKIE

Uh-huh.

NICOLET

Was she there?

JACKIE

She didn't say.

NICOLET

But she mentioned Beaumont by name?

JACKIE

Uh-huh.

NICOLET

Well, this sounds like a lady I'd

like to have a word with. So

everything's set for tomorrow?

JACKIE

Right. Everything's the same, except

one change...

JACKIE

I told them Ordell's changed the

amount he's bringing in.

MAX

Do you think they bought it?

JACKIE

Oh, yeah. I got them thinking

Ordell's real nervous. They love

thinking he's scared of them.

MAX

You know, a good cop won't let you

know he knows you're fulla shit.

JACKIE

All he needed was a reasonable

explanation.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACKIE

Right. Everything's the same except

one change. Ordell thinks it's just

too hot right now to bring in all his

money. He knows you're watching him,

and he's paranoid. He's keeping his

stash where it is, but he wants to

bring in fifty thousand for bail in

case he needs it.

CUT TO:

MAX

It'll be more than that.

JACKIE

Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

MAX

But you still have to show him the

money at the airport.

JACKIE

Well, you know I'm not going to show

him the whole amount. He'll see fifty

thousand.

MAX

Where's the rest of it?

JACKIE

In the bag underneath.

MAX

What if he checks it?

JACKIE

He won't - I mean, he didn't the last

time. He'll be expecting fifty

thousand and there it is - on top.

MAX

You're takin' a helluva chance kid.

JACKIE

Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.

Walker put the money in, and I didn't

know nothing about it. Like the coke.

MAX

Then you're out and you get nothing.

JACKIE

Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I

tried.

MAX

You're gonna have surveillance all

over you.

JACKIE

That's why you don't make a move till

I come out of the fitting room.

MAX

In a dress.

JACKIE

Well, a suit. There's one I had my

eye on.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Excuse me.

ORDELL

It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change

in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout

- everything's the same - except for

one change. That bitch you saw in the

mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,

cause she split on me.

(pause)

Me an Louis went over to her place

,she's gone. She's gone and all her

shit's gone and so's my ten thousand

dollars.

(pause)

It ain't nothin' to worry about,

girl. Everything's just like we

discussed. Except when you do the

switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna

be Melanie.

MELANIE

Chicken shit.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

CUT TO:

PASSENGER

Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink

and you spend half the fuckin' flight

in the can. Soon as we land I'm

making a formal complaint.

JACKIE

Why, because I called you an asshole.

PASSENGER

You didn't call me that.

JACKIE

I didn't? Oh, well, you're an

asshole.

NICOLET

We have to stop meeting like this.

JACKIE

You said that the last time.

NICOLET

Well, it's true, isn't it? After his

is buttoned up we could meet

someplace else. What do you think?

JACKIE

We could, if I'm not in jail.

NICOLET

Oh, that's taken care of. I called

the State Attorney's Office. You were

no-filed this morning in Circuit

Court.

JACKIE

Are you saying I'm off the hook?

NICOLET

Free as a bird. I still expect you to

finish the job, though. How much do

you have this time?

JACKIE

Fifty thousand, like I said. He's

pretty sure he's gonna need it for

bail.

NICOLET

That's fifty thousand, huh? It

doesn't look like that much.

JACKIE

I was told ten thousand in each pack.

NICOLET

You didn't count it?

JACKIE

I never have. It's not my money.

NICOLET

He might have slipped some coke in

here. Did you check?

JACKIE

Mr. Walker promised he'd never do

that again.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Ever been tempted?

NICOLET

What? To put one of these in my

pocket?

JACKIE

Uh-huh.

NICOLET

If I did, I'd have to give you one,

wouldn't I? Or we could take what we

want. No one knows how much there is

except us, right?

JACKIE

Yes. All those things are true.

NICOLET

After all, it don't belong to nobody,

right?

JACKIE

That would be one point of view.

NICOLET

Yeah, well, it's not a point of view

that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it

evidence, it belongs to us. You are

now officially out of trouble. Don't

do nothing stupid, now.

JACKIE

How can I do anything if I'm being

watched every second?

NICOLET

I'm glad you realize that. Saves me

the trouble of pointing it out to

you.

(holding up the money)

Put this in your shopping bag. It's

what I expect to find when I look in

Sheronda's. Comprende?

JACKIE

Si.

MAX

I'm going out for a few hours.

WINSTON

(to phone)

Hold on a minute.

(to Max)

Where you going?

MAX

I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie,

get something to eat.

WINSTON

Watcha gonna see?

MAX

Whatever looks best and starts the

soonest.

WINSTON

Have fun.

ORDELL

What the fuck are you two still doing

there?!

LOUIS

I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.

ORDELL

Well, you the one in motherfuckin'

charge.

LOUIS

Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'

ORDELL

Go in there, snatch her by the hair,

and drag her big ass out. This is my

goddam money we're talking about. Get

your ass out the door.

LOUIS

We're leaving now!

MELANIE (O.S.)

All right already.

AMY

Can I help you?

JACKIE

Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye

on.

AMY

Oh, my God. You look so cool.

JACKIE

This looks pretty good on me.

AMY

Are you kidding, it looks great. You

wear this to a business meeting,

you're the badass in the room. But

you can go out dancing in this too.

It's a total power suit.

JACKIE

I think I'm gonna just get this for

today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would

you mind ringing this up while I

change out of it?

AMY

Not a problem.

JACKIE

Thanks.

MEALNIE (O.S.)

Jackie?

JACKIE

Hi, Melanie.

MELANIE (O.S.)

Are you getting that black suit?

JACKIE

Yeah, do you like it?

MELANIE (O.S.)

It looks good on you.

JACKIE

Do you got something for me?

MELANIE (O.S.)

You betcha.

MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

We coulda worked this. You know that,

dontcha? You would've made out a lot

better than you're going to, believe

me.

JACKIE

I put a little cherry on top. You're

right. What the hell he ever do for

us?

MELANIE (O.S.)

(quietly)

Thanks.

JACKIE

Now be careful with that bag. You

don't want it ripping open on you in

the middle of the store.

JACKIE

I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in

the suit - get out of that damn

uniform.

AMY

Oh, that's not a problem.

JACKIE

Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in

there. Looks like beach towels.

JACKIE

Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She

took the money.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Melanie burst in the dressing room

and took the money!

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Come on, goddammit, we're late!

MELANIE

Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.

LOUIS

We shoulda been there already and we

woulda been if it hadn't been for

your fuckin' around!

AM

... You wear this to a business

meeting, you're the badass in the

room...

MELANIE

That's a nice outfit on her. I'm

gonna go over and look at this Michi

Moon display.

LOUIS

Just stay right fuckin' here, all

right?

MELANIE

Are you sweating?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Job a little too much for you?

MELANIE

I'll be over here. You're too

conspicuous.

LOUIS

(under his breath)

Goddammit, not till I tell ya.

LOUIS

What are you doin'?

MELANIE

I'm getting out of here. What do you

think?

LOUIS

Lemme have the bag.

MELANIE

Fuck you. I can carry it.

LOUIS

Goddam you. Gimme that bag,

MELANIE

Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the

fuckin' bag?

LOUIS

Gimme that bag before I knock you out

and take it.

MELANIE

Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's

wrong with you?

LOUIS

I'm carrying it.

MELANIE

Okay, you got it. Just take a chill

pill, for christ sake.

LOUIS

Fuck you with your chill pill.

MELANIE

Remember where we came in?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

(like a teacher on Romper

Room)

Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came

in through Bullocks. I know where it

is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?

MELANIE

You have no idea where you parked, do

you?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Jesus, but if you two aren't the

biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my

life... How did you ever rob a bank?

When you robbed banks, did you have

to look for your car then too? No

wonder you went to jail.

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Is it this aisle, Lou-is?

LOUIS

Yeah, down the end.

MELANIE

You sure?

MELANIE (CONT'D)

Is it this aisle or the next one

over?

LOUIS

This one.

MELANIE

You sure?

LOUIS

Don't say anything else, okay? I'm

telling you, keep your mouth shut.

LOUIS

I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'

word.

MELANIE

Okay, Lou-is.

LOUIS

See, just where I fuckin' said it

was!

LOUIS

Hey, look. I found it!

CUT TO:

SALESGIRL

Can I show you something?

MAX

Not right now. I'm just killing time

waiting for my wife. But thanks,

anyway.

SALESGIRL

Sure thing. If anything grabs you,

don't be shy.

MAX

Thanks, I won't.

AMY

Oh, my God. You look so cool.

MAX (CONT'D)

(low)

And away we go.

JACKIE

Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in

there. Looks like beach towels.

MAX

Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen

years dealing with people who take

incredible risks. You walk over to

that counter, you're gonna find out

what it's like.

MAX

Excuse me, but my wife thinks she

left a bag of beach towels in the

fitting room?

AMY

Yeah, I think they're back there. Go

get 'em. There's nobody in there. I

think they're in the last stall.

MAX

Thanks.

MAX

Got 'em, thanks.

AMY

Sure thing.

BARTENDER

There a Ordell here?

ORDELL

That's me.

BARTENDER

Don't talks all day.

LOUIS

It's Louis.

ORDELL

(now into phone)

Did you get it?

LOUIS

I got it. Listen, there's something

else I have to tell you.

ORDELL

When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.

You count the money?

LOUIS

I haven't even looked at it yet, it's

still in the shopping bag.

ORDELL

Melanie must be dyin' to see it.

(pause)

Louis.

LOUIS

That's what I got to talk to you

about. You see, Melanie was giving me

a hard time -

ORDELL

- Not now, pick me up.

ORDELL

You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where

they got all them car dealerships.

We're gonna leave this heap in a

parking lot and get one the cops

don't know about.

(pause)

Hey, where's Melanie?

LOUIS

That's what I gotta tell you. She

bugged me the whole time. Got pissy

with me 'cause I wouldn't let her

carry the bag. Started running her

fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember

right away when we came out where the

car was parked, so she got on me

about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,

is it that one?" She was totally

fuckin' with my nerves.

ORDELL

So what, you left her there.

LOUIS

I shot her.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

I expect she's dead.

ORDELL

You shot Melanie?

LOUIS

Twice. In the parking lot.

ORDELL

Couldn't talk to her?

LOUIS

You know how she is.

ORDELL

You couldn't just hit her?

LOUIS

Maybe... but at that moment... I

dunno...

ORDELL

You shot her twice?

LOUIS

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

So you're sure she's dead.

LOUIS

Pretty sure.

ORDELL

Where did you shoot her?

LOUIS

In the chest and stomach.

ORDELL

Well, if you had to do it, you had to

do it. What we don't want is that

bitch surviving on us. Anybody but

that woman.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

(quiet)

Louis?

LOUIS

(not looking at him)

What?

ORDELL

Where's the rest of it?

LOUIS

(looking at him)

How much it there?

ORDELL

Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

LOUIS

You said five hundred and fifty!

ORDELL

(calm)

So you light, ain't you. You light

about a half-a-million.

LOUIS

Look, that's the bag she came out

with. She never even put her hand in

it, and neither did I.

ORDELL

Came outta where?

LOUIS

The fitting room. It went down

exactly the way it was supposed to.

ORDELL

How long was she in there?

LOUIS

Maybe a minute. She came right out.

ORDELL

Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

LOUIS

Look, I swear to fucking god, she

came out with that bag and I took it

from her.

ORDELL

Then what?

LOUIS

We went to the parking lot.

ORDELL

Where you shot her.

LOUIS

That's right.

ORDELL

You sure she ain't somewhere with a

half-a-million dollars I worked my

ass off to earn?

LOUIS

(quietly)

Fuck you for asking me that.

ORDELL

Pull the car over.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

What'd you shoot her with?

LOUIS

It's in there.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

What's that gonna tell you" If I was

really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken

two out, wouldn't I? I thought you

trusted me.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACKIE

Gotcha, nigga.

DISSOLVE BACK

TO:

ORDELL

Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.

LOUIS

If she's got it, why didn't she take

it all?

ORDELL

'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,

I'll ask her.

LOUIS

Maybe the Feds got it.

ORDELL

If there were nothin; in here but

towels, maybe she didn't get a chance

to take it from her suitcase and

A.T.F. got it. But, she put these

fuckin' books in here to trick our

ass.

LOUIS

That's why I never checked it. The

bag felt right.

ORDELL

Then she throws forty thousand in

here, to rub the shit in my face,

know what I'm saying? She wants me to

know she ripped me off.

LOUIS

I don't know. Either she has it or

the Feds.

ORDELL

Or...

(pause)

... she gave it to somebody else

first, before Melanie went in the

dressing room.

LOUIS

Jesus Christ.

ORDELL

What?

LOUIS

You know who I saw in the dress

department?

ORDELL

Tell me.

LOUIS

I didn't really think anything of it.

No - I did wonder what he was doing

there, but didn't think it had

anything to do with us. You know like

maybe he was there with his wife or

girlfriend.

ORDELL

You gonna tell me who it was?

LOUIS

Max Cherry.

ORDELL

You see Max Cherry in the dress

department. We're about to be handed

half-a-million dollars - Man, look at

me when I'm talking to you! And you

don't think nothing of him being

there!

LOUIS

Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know

each other?

ORDELL

Hell, yes, they know each other. He

bonded her out of county.

LOUIS

How am I supposed to know that?

ORDELL

You know the motherfucker's a bail

bondsman, don't ya? You know every

last one of them motherfuckers is

crooked as hell?

LOUIS

Why should I think anything's weird,

if I don't know nothin' about them

knowing each other?

ORDELL

Man, I don't want to hear your

fuckin' excuses!

LOUIS

I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,

I'm givin' you reasons.

ORDELL

Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you

lost all the goddam money I got in

the world! Let me tell you the

reason, motherfucker! The reason is,

your ass ain't worth a shit no more!

LOUIS

(hard)

You best back off.

ORDELL

What the fuck happened to you, man?

Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICOLET

You didn't tell me you were gonna do

some shopping.

JACKIE

I thought I did.

NICOLET

You didn't. I would think with all

this on your mind, you'd wait till

after.

JACKIE

I got there early. I've had my eye on

this suit - Wait, let's start over. I

got there early. The idea was to try

on the suit, see if I liked it. If I

did, get them to wrap it up, and

change back into my uniform. That's

what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.

Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag

with fifty thousand, and go home.

NICOLET

But you didn't do that.

JACKIE

Because I didn't have it. Ray, I

swear, Melanie came in and grabbed

it.

(pause)

And someone killed her for it.

NICOLET

Where's the bag she gave you?

JACKIE

She didn't give me one. I told you

before, Melanie wasn't part of the

plan. Ordell must of told her to do

it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping

bag, and takes off. What am I

supposed to do, go after her? I'm in

my fucking underwear. I had to get

dressed before I could do anything.

So I put this back on 'cause could

put this on faster than I could my

uniform.

NICOLET

You took the time to pay the

saleswoman.

JACKIE

I had to. I was frantic. I didn't

know what to do.

NICOLET

What did you do after that?

JACKIE

I went looking for you. I went

straight to the bookstore, 'cause

that's where you were last time, but

you weren't there. How the hell else

am I supposed to let anybody know

what happened? You didn't tell me how

to do that, did you? I knew I was

under surveillance, so when I

couldn't spot anybody, I started

yelling.

NICOLET

There was a guy with Melanie?

JACKIE

Not in the fitting room.

CUT TO:

NICOLET (V.O.)

We had our agent on you. She sees a

blonde come out of the fitting room

carrying a Robinson's/May bag and

tussle with a tough-looking white

guy. The white guy takes the shopping

bag and they go.

NICOLET

This guy with Melanie, that was Louis

Gara?

JACKIE

I didn't see him. I was in my

underwear. If it was a white guy, it

was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?

NICOLET

It's possible. You're saying you

don't have any idea what happened to

that fifty thousand?

JACKIE

I have no idea.

NICOLET

You'd take a polygraph on it?

JACKIE

If it'll make you happy.

NICOLET

I sure hope you haven't done anything

dumb Jackie.

DARGUS

(to Nicolet)

Can I have a word with you?

NICOLET

Sure.

NICOLET (CONT'D)

Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him

dead in a car on Ninth. And we've

lost Ordell.

JACKIE

I thought you were watching him.

NICOLET

We were, and we lost him. He walked

into a strip bar sometime around

three thirty and never came out. The

bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-

and-a-half from where Louis was found

dead. It looks like Louis's friend

shot him twice at point blank range.

JACKIE

So what happens now?

NICOLET

We pick up Ordell. We've got three

murders we can link him to. We have

the storage unit where he keeps his

guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search

warrant to go in and get him. And we

have you.

JACKIE

What about me?

NICOLET

What about you?

JACKIE

Do you think I took some of that

money?

NICOLET

I have no evidence of your taking

anything. You didn't pay for your

snazzy new suit with marked bills; I

was glad to see that. You've been

helping us out, you gave us Melanie

and Louis. Melanie had a packet of

marked bills stuffed in her shorts

when they found her, which goes a

long way backing up your story.

NICOLET (CONT'D)

I'll settle for Ordell with the

marked bills.

NICOLET

If you have something else going on

you haven't told me about, it's

between you and Ordell. All I gotta

say is, you better hope we find him

before he finds you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ORDEL

... I can't leave here today... Mr.

Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I

get my money... You wouldn't have

that fuckin' boat weren't for me.

Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my

friends are... Mr. Walker?

ORDELL

Can you believe that shit?

Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate

nigger. Do things for people and

that's how they treat you. Goddamn

girl, how can you live like this?

RAYNELLE

(stoned)

Like what?

ORDELL

Girl, this shit is repugnant.

WINSTON (O.S.)

(on other end of phone)

Cherry Bail Bonds.

ORDELL

Let me speak to Max Cherry.

WINSTON

He ain't here right now.

ORDELL

He leave town?

WINSTON

He's around.

ORDELL

Give me his home number.

WINSTON

I'll give you his beeper.

CUT TO:

ORDELL

Hello.

MAX

I've been looking for you.

ORDELL

You know who this is?

MAX

Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the

ten thousand you put up. Isn't that

why you called.

MAX (CONT'D)

The bond collateral on Beaumont

Livingston you moved over to cover

Miss Brown, remember?

ORDELL

She got off, huh?

MAX

They decided to no-file. Tell me

where you are and I'll bring you your

money.

MAX (CONT'D)

You still there?

ORDELL

Looky here, I know you helped her and

I know you know what I want Jackie

can tell me any story come in that

pretty head of hers. Long as at the

end of that story, she hands over my

money. She do that, we're still

friends. Now, she don't wanna be my

friend no more, tell her to think

about ol' Louis. And if she tries to

turn me in, I'll name her ass as my

accessory. We'll go upstate together.

Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that

shit's a promise, understand what I'm

sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll

call you back.

MAX

You're right, that was Ordell. You

have time, you think you could find

out for me where he's staying?

WINSTON

Cops can't locate him, huh?

MAX

They don't have your winning

personality.

WINSTON

Sure thing. I don't have to know what

I'm doing, long as you know.

MAX

I think I do. Is that good enough?

JACKIE

Hello.

MAX

I know where he is.

JACKIE

How'd you find out?

MAX

All Winston had to do was ask around.

Ordell's living in Long Beach with a

woman junkie.

JACKIE

How does Winston find him if A.T.F.

and all the local Police can't?

MAX

People talk to Winston. He's street,

same as them, they trust him. They

get busted, they know somebody who

can bond them out. I thought I might

drop in on him. He'll no doubt be

surprised to see me.

JACKIE

He's liable to shoot you.

MAX

On the phone I told him I have the

ten thousand he put up for your bond.

I could bring the money and the

papers for him to sign. Walk out and

call the Sheriff's department.

JACKIE

Ray wants him.

MAX

Everybody wants him, he's a homicide

suspect. It doesn't matter who brings

him in, he's gonna name you as an

accessory.

JACKIE

That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the

case. I'm their witness. They

wouldn't have a case without me. If

it's his word against mine, who are

they gonna believe?

MAX

It's not that simple.

JACKIE

It never was, so I'm not gonna start

worrying about it now. Look, Ray more

or less believes my story, and he

more or less doesn't care. All he

really gives a shit about is getting

Ordell.

MAX

So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?

JACKIE

Get Ordell to come to your office.

MAX

Set him up.

JACKIE

Uh-huh.

MAX

Tell him you want to see him?

JACKIE

Tell him I want to give him his

money.

MAX

Why?

JACKIE

I've chickened out. I'm afraid of

him. He'll like that.

MAX

What do you tell Nicolet?

JACKIE

Ordell called and wants to meet me

and I'm scared.

MAX

We get Ordell to come to my office.

Nicolet - is he already there, or

does he come busting in while we're

chatting?

JACKIE

He's already there.

MAX

What if he hears something he's not

supposed to?

JACKIE

Well, we don't let that happen, now

do we?

ORDELL

What the fuck you doin' knockin on

the door like the goddamn police? You

lookin' to get shot?

MAX

I thought you might be asleep.

ORDELL

You keep fuckin' with me, you're

gonna be asleep forever.

MAX

I'm alone.

ORDELL

Git your ass in here.

ORDELL

You better freeze, motherfucker!

MAX

You want your money? Your bond

refund?

ORDELL

That's all?

MAX

I have a bond receipt for you to

sign.

ORDELL

You know what the fuck I'm talkin'

about. You talk to her?

MAX

She wants to give you your money. If

she didn't, there'd be cops batter-

ramming the door right now.

ORDELL

How'd you find me?

MAX

Winston found you.

ORDELL

How the fuck did he find me?

MAX

That's what Winston does. He finds

people who don't want to be found.

ORDELL

Well, bully for that nigga. You say

she wants to give me the money, huh?

MAX

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

Well, give it to me then.

MAX

She wants to give it to you herself

and collect her ten percent. She also

wants to explain why she had to hold

on to it.

ORDELL

I'd like to hear that too. Turn

around and put your hands on your

head.

MAX

Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd

already tried to get Jackie to go in

with her, split the half million

amongst themselves. What she did was

take quite a risk to see you get your

money.

ORDELL

Lift up your pant leg. You help her?

MAX

All I did was walk out with it.

ORDELL

And you did that to protect my

interest?

MAX

In a way, yes.

ORDELL

My ass be dumb, but I'm not a

dumbass. Go sit over there on the

couch.

MAX

This place stinks.

ORDELL

You get used to it after a while. Now

tell me where my money's at.

MAX

My office.

ORDELL

And where's Jackie?

MAX

She's been there since Thursday

night.

ORDELL

She wanted to see me, why wasn't she

home?

MAX

She was afraid.

ORDELL

(laughs)

That I gotta see.

MAX

She still is. She doesn't want to get

shot before she can tell you what

happened.

ORDELL

Have her bring the money here.

MAX

It's in the safe. She can't get at

it.

ORDELL

Call her, tell her the combination.

MAX

I'm telling you, you got her spooked.

She won't leave there till you have

your money and you're gone.

ORDELL

You expect me to just walk in there?

MAX

If she wanted to set you up, you'd be

in custody right now. When you said

you'd name her as an accessory she

believed you. That scares her more

than anything.

ORDELL

That's why she's givin' up my money

huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.

I didn't trust her ass neither, but I

knew how to handle her. She was my

blonde-headed little surfer gal. I

fuckin' told Louis he could've just

given her a punch in the mouth, he

didn't need to shoot her. She's at

your office.

MAX

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

By herself. That big mandingo nigga

Winston ain't there, is he?

MAX

She's all alone.

ORDELL

I call your office, she better answer

the phone.

MAX

She will.

JACKIE

I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.

ORDELL

All the time I've known her, I never

heard her sound scared like that.

Ordinarily she's too cool for school.

I'm driving, gimme the keys.

MAX

It's the next street.

ORDELL

I know where it is.

MAX

Turn left.

ORDELL

I know where to turn.

ORDELL

My money's in that office, right?

MAX

Uh-huh.

ORDELL

She starts givin' me some bullshit

about it ain't there. It's somewhere

else and we can go get it.

(he holds up his Beretta)

I'm shootin' you in the head right

then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot

her in the kneecap, find out where my

godamn money is. I go walkin' in

there and that nigga Winston or

anybody else is in there, you're the

first man shot, understand what I'm

sayin'?

MAX

Yeah.

ORDELL

Now, is there anything you want to

tell me before we get out of this

car?

MAX

No.

ORDELL

You sure?

MAX

Yes.

ORDELL

You better be, motherfucker.

ORDELL

Get ahead of me and open the door.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Step inside easy.

ORDELL (CONT'D)

Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting

in the goddamn dark for?

JACKIE

Mark...

(raising her voice)

... he's got a gun!

DARGUS

He's dead.

DARGUS (CONT'D)

Does he have the marked bills on him?

MAX

In his inside coat pocket.

DARGUS

Why were you with him?

MAX

I went to give him his refund, so he

wouldn't have to come here.

DARGUS

How'd you know where he was?

MAX

I found out.

DARGUS

And you didn't tell the Police?

MAX

I told Jackie, and Jackie said you

wanted him.

JACKIE

Remember when Ray said you hoped

you'd get him before he got me?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Well, you did. Thank you.

FADE TO BLACK

JACKIE (O.S.)

Knock knock.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Hey.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Mark... he's got a gun!

MAX

Hey, you.

JACKIE

I got your package. It was fun

getting a half-a-million dollars in

the mail.

MAX

Less ten percent.

JACKIE

Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that

out, since there wasn't no note.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.

MAX

I hesitated taking that much.

JACKIE

You worked for it - if you're sure that's all

you want.

MAX

I'm sure.

JACKIE

I'm leaving, I have my things in my

car. Why don't you walk out with me?

I want to show you something.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he

pissed he missed all the excitement.

MAX

What's he doing?

JACKIE

He's on to a new thing. He's after a

guy who owns a gun shop he says is

"woefully and wantonly" selling

assault rifles to minors. He says

he's gonna take him down if it's the

last thing he does.

MAX

Did you tell him you were leaving?

JACKIE

I told him I might.

MAX

That's Ordell's.

JACKIE

They've confiscated all his other

stuff. But this one's sorta left

over. The registration's in the glove

box, the keys were under the seat...

What's a matter" haven't you ever

borrowed someone's car?

MAX

Not after they're dead.

JACKIE

I didn't use you, Max.

MAX

I didn't say you did.

JACKIE

I never lied to you.

MAX

I know.

JACKIE

We're partners.

MAX

I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't

blame anybody for anything I do.

JACKIE

Do you blame yourself for helping me?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

'd feel a whole lot better if you

took some more money.

MAX

(smiling)

You'll get over that.

MAX (CONT'D)

Where're you going?

JACKIE

Spain.

MAX

Madrid or Barcelona?

JACKIE

Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I hear they don't eat dinner till

midnight.

JACKIE

Wanna go?

MAX

Thanks, but you have a good time.

JACKIE

Sure I can't twist your arm?

MAX

Thank you for saying that, but no. My

business.

JACKIE

I thought you were tired of your

business?

MAX

I'm just tired in general.

JACKIE

Are you scared of me?

MAX

A little bit.

JACKIE

Come over here.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I'll send you a postcard, partner.
