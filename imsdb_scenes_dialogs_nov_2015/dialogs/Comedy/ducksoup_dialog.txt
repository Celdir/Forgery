THE BREAKFAST CLUB

Duck Soup (1933)

Screenplay by

Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones

MRS. TEASDALE

It is so good of you to come.

NOTABLE

An honor, Mrs. Teasdale...  You must

indeed have great faith in your new

dictator to give him such a

magnificent reception.

MRS. TEASDALE

I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the

only logical successor to my dear

departed husband.  He has the

statesmanship of Gladstone, the

humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom

of Pericles.

FIRST CABINET MEMBER

(Protestingly)

Mrs. Teasdale, as members of

Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve

of your choice.  Who is this Rufus

T. Firefly?

SECOND CABINET MEMBER

(Waving aloft a paper)

A stranger in our midst, an agent

for the Eureka Ammunition Company.

Think of it, Gentlemen, an ammunition

salesman dictating the policies of

our peace-loving country.

THIRD CABINET MEMBER

Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it

is too late.  The citizens of

Freedonia want a President!

MRS. TEASDALE

As the widow of your last president,

I have the right to choose -- and,

Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the

matter any further.

SERVANT

His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi

Trentino of Amnesia!

TRENTINO

Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.

MRS. TEASDALE

(To niece)

Your uncle has been such a friend to

us in every crisis.  Without his

country's financial aid --

TRENTINO

(Lightly)

What is money?

(Tenderly)

Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do

anything.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Flustered)

Ambassador!

(Attempting to change

the subject)

I am so anxious for you to meet our

new dictator.

TRENTINO

(Persistent in his

flattery)

Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules

Freedonia, to me you will always be

the first lady of the land.

VERA

Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless --

you've been the only topic of

conversation ever since we left

Amnesia.

SERVANT

The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of

Mufhtan!

MRS. TEASDALE

(Hastily)

Oh, I must greet His Honor.

VERA

So that's the one you want to marry.

TRENTINO

With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and

Freedonia under my control --

(He rubs his hands

significantly)

VERA

Maybe it's not going to be so easy.

From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale

is rather sweet on this Rufus T.

Firefly.

TRENTINO

That's where you come in.  I'll leave

him in your hands, and don't forget

you're supposed to be my niece.

MRS. TEASDALE

I want you to meet the son of His

Excellency -- Bob Firefly...

TRENTINO

Isn't it about time for the ceremony

to begin, Mrs. Teasdale?

(Mockingly)

I do hope His Excellency won't be

late.

BOB

(Defensively)

My father makes it a point to always

be on time.  As long as I've known

him, he's never been late for an

appointment.

TRENTINO

But it's two minutes of ten now.

BOB

(As music begins)

His Excellency is due To take his

station.  Beginning his new

Administration...  He'll make his

appearance when The clock on the

wall strikes ten.

MRS. TEASDALE

(singing)

When the clock on the wall strikes

ten All you loyal ladies and you

patriotic men Let's sing the national

anthem when...  The clock on the

wall strikes ten.

ALL

(singing)

Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Mightiest

of mighty nations!  Hail, hail,

Freedonia Land of the brave and free.

ALL

(singing)

Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the

brave and free.

ALL

Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the

brave and free.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Nervously)

I hope nothing has happened.

BOB

Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is

nothing to worry about.  Father is

probably taking extra care in getting

into his robes of state.  I'll call

him.

ALL

Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the

brave and free.

MRS.  TEASDALE

(Beaming as she

addresses Groucho)

As chairwoman of the reception

committee, I welcome you and extend

the good wishes of every man, woman

and child of Freedonia.  I deem it

an honor on this momentous occasion...

GROUCHO

(Interrupting)

Never mind that stuff...

GROUCHO

Take a card.

MRS. TEASDALE

What'll I do with this card?

GROUCHO

You can keep it -- I've got a whole

pack...  Now what were you saying?

MRS.  TEASDALE

As chairwoman of the reception

committee, I welcome you with open

arms.

GROUCHO

How late do you stay open?

MRS. TEASDALE

In choosing you, I feel that I serve

my country well.  I heartily endorse

everything you stand for.

GROUCHO

Well, I won't stand for much.  And I

won't stand for you if you don't

show some improvement soon.  Look at

your report card last month -- "D"

in spelling...  six in behavior.

Now who were the six?  A fine state

of affairs -- no wonder you can't

matriculate, now what were you saying?

MRS. TEASDALE

The future of Freedonia rests upon

you.  Promise me you will follow in

my husband's footsteps.

GROUCHO

(To CAMERA)

I haven't been on the job five minutes

and already she's making advances to

me.

(To Mrs. Teasdale)

Not that I care -- but where is your

husband?

MRS. TEASDALE

(Slightly embarrassed)

Why - er -- my husband passed away...

(reverently)

I was with him to the very end.

GROUCHO

No wonder he passed away.  I'd like

to be with you to the very end.

Can't you see what I'm trying to

tell you -- I love you.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Very warmly)

Your Excellency!

GROUCHO

You're not so bad yourself, Mrs.

Teasdale, when I look at you I can

see that we're facing a crisis.

We've got to balance the budget --

we've got to cut down everything

including, you.

MRS.  TEASDALE

Oh...  Your Excellency... I would

like to present to you... Ambassador

Verdi Trentino Of Amnesia...  Having

him with us today is indeed a great

honor.

TRENTINO

(To Mrs. Teasdale,

smiling appreciatively)

Thanks... but I can't stay very long.

GROUCHO

That's even a greater honor.

TRENTINO

I bring you the greetings of my

President and the good will of my

people.

GROUCHO

I'll keep the greetings -- but you

can send back the good will... what

we need right now is twenty million

dollars.

TRENTINO

Twenty million dollars is a

considerable sum...  I'll have to

discuss that with my Minister of

Finance.

GROUCHO

Well, in the meantime, could you let

me have $50 personally?

TRENTINO

(Surprised)

$50?

GROUCHO

I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll

give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.

(Throwing a glance at

Mrs. Teasdale)

or my jackknife.  If you want my

advice, you'll take the jackknife...

I've a better proposition...  Make

it $25 and I'll give you a first

mortgage on my son and I hope you

foreclose.

TRENTINO

(With a puzzled look

at Groucho)

Your Excellency, haven't we met

before?

GROUCHO

(Looking at Trentino)

Why yes.  I met you at the dog races --

say, you could have won that race if

you tried a little harder.

TRENTINO

Excellency, may I present my niece.

GROUCHO

Go ahead.

TRENTINO

You don't understand.  This is my

niece Vera.

GROUCHO

(Throwing her a glance)

And Vera niece, too.

VERA

Your Excellency, please don't think

me silly, but I'd love to have a

picture of you.  I want to hang it

in my bedroom.

GROUCHO

You couldn't hang me in your bedroom --

I'll make a note of it.  Where's my

secretary?

(Looking around)

BOB

Here I am, Father.

GROUCHO

(To Bob)

Take a letter.

BOB

(Taking out a

stenographer's pad

and pencil)

Who to?

GROUCHO

The President of the United States.

GROUCHO

My dear President...  read it back...

BOB

(Reading from pad)

"My dear President"...

GROUCHO

That doesn't sound right...  take

out "President"...  now read it.

BOB

(Reading)

"My dear"...

GROUCHO

That's not right yet... put back

"President" and take out "dear"...

How does it read now?

BOB

(Reading)

"My President"...

GROUCHO

There's still something wrong with

it... take out "President" ...now

what've you got?

BOB

(Reading)

"My"...

GROUCHO

Now we're on the right track... Put

back "dear"... How does it read?

BOB

(Reading)

"My dear"...

GROUCHO

You can't say that to the President...

Put back "President"... Now let's

hear how sounds.

BOB

(Reading)

"My dear President"...

GROUCHO

That's what I wanted in the first

place.  Tear it up and send it

airmail.

BOB

Is that all?

GROUCHO

Take another letter...  to my tailor.

GROUCHO

Dear Sir... enclosed find check for

$100.  Yours very truly...  Send

that immediately.

BOB

I'll have to enclose the check first.

GROUCHO

You do and I'll fire you.

MRS. TEASDALE

(To Groucho)

Your Excellency, the eyes of the

world are upon you.  Notables from

every land are gathered here in your

honor --

(Indicating the guests

with a wave of her

hand)

This is a gala day for us.

GROUCHO

Well, a gal a day is enough for me.

I couldn't handle any more.

MRS. TEASDALE

If it's not asking too much --

(Recitative)

For our information just for

illustration

(Begins tune)

Tell us how you intend to run the

nation.

GROUCHO

(Singing)

These are the laws of my

administration: No one's allowed to

smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And

whistling is forbidden...

ENSEMBLE

(Singing)

We're not allowed to tell a dirty

joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA

GROUCHO

(Singing)

If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer

is pursued And in the hoosegow

hidden...

ENSEMBLE

(Singing)

If we should choose to chew, we'll

be pursued -

GROUCHO

If any form of pleasure is exhibited

Report to me and it will be

prohibited.  I'll put my foot down;

So shall it be - This is the land of

the free.  The last man nearly ruined

this place He didn't know what to do

with it.  If you think this country's

bad off now Just wait 'till I get

through with it.

(Does sailor's hornpipe)

The treasury is low on dough; The

last man went and flew with it.  If

you think we're short of money now

Just wait 'till I get through with

it.

(Does Highland fling)

The country's taxes must be fixed -

And I know what to do with it, If

you think you're paying too much

now, Just wait 'till I get through

with it.

(Takes flute from

inside pocket and

plays strain of Dixie)

DIGNITARY

(Singing)

In our midst you stand The ruler of

this land A man who'll govern with

an iron hand.

GROUCHO

(Singing)

If anyone gets fresh with me, I'll

show him who's the boss; I'll stand

upon my dignity, And toss him for a

loss.  And this will be the penalty

For those who doublecross - We'll

stand 'em up against the wall, and

Pop goes the Weasel

ENSEMBLE

(Singing)

If you should make him cross, He'll

toss you for a loss.  If anyone gets

fresh with him, He'll show him who's

the boss.

GROUCHO

(Singing)

I will not stand for anything that's

crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on

the up and up, So everyone beware.

If anyone's caught taking graft And

I don't get my share, we'll stand

'em up against the wall - and pop

goes the weasel!

ENSEMBLE

(Singing)

So everyone beware Who's crooked or

unfair; No one must take a bit of

graft Unless he gets his share.

(Groucho dances as

above is sung)

GROUCHO

(Singing)

If any man should come between A

husband and his bride, We find out

which one she prefers By letting her

decide.  If she prefers the other

man, The husband steps outside; We

stand him up against the wall And

Pop goes the Weasel!

ENSEMBLE

(Singing)

The husband steps outside;

Relinquishes his bride; We stand him

up against the wall And take him for

a ride.

(Groucho dances as

above is sung)

GROUCHO

The population must increase With

great rapidity.  We give a couple

seven years To raise a family. If,

by that time, there is no branch

Upon the family tree, we stand 'em

up against the wall - and Pop goes

the Weasel.

MRS. TEASDALE

(As she beams on him)

You've made a wonderful impression.

Your views are liberal... It is easy

to see you have an open mind.

GROUCHO

That's what I get for dressing in a

hurry.

MRS. TEASDALE

Your Excellency, you mustn't forget

your appointment at the House of

Representatives... Have you got your

speech ready?

GROUCHO

I wrote a speech last night that'll

knock them off their seats...

(He takes a paper

from inside pocket

as he says above...

then reads from paper)

Four score and seven years ago, our

fathers brought forth on this

continent a new nation --

MRS. TEASDALE

Why, that's the speech that Lincoln

made at Gettysburg...

GROUCHO

(With a look of great

surprise)

He did?... I told my son not to leave

it laying around... Where is son?

BOB

Here I am, Father...

GROUCHO

Send for my car...

BOB

(Calling to servant

off scene)

His Excellency's car!

GUARDS

(In unison)

His Excellency's car!

GROUCHO

To the House of Representatives...

ride like fury... Don't stop for any

signals and don't wait for a corner

to make a turn... see if you can

break a record...

GROUCHO

A fine thing -- leaving the head of

the nation at the foot of the

stairs...

GROUCHO

That concludes the nine o'clock

sprints... Next Saturday night the

winner of the six day bicycle race

will receive ten thousand dollars in

gold... the following morning we go

off the gold standard...

END OF SEQUENCE "A"

SEQUENCE "B"

SPEAKER

Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember for

forty-six years we have enjoyed the

friendship of Amnesia, so ably

represented by Ambassador Trentino.

(Indicating the

Ambassador who is

present)

We owe it to ourselves to listen to

what he has to say...

TRENTINO

Gentlemen, while I admit it is unusual

for a representative of one country

to advise the legislative body of

another, I assure you that I have

the interest of Freedonia at heart

...

(Deferential applause)

We have lent you money in the past --

we are willing to lend you money

again -- but, we cannot do it if

your leader is allowed by you, to

carry out his ridiculous proposals...

In self-protection it is my --

BOB

I object!...  we have no right to

discuss this matter in the absence

of my father.

SPEAKER

(To House)

We have been meeting every morning

for eight days and not once has His

Excellency been on time...

TRENTINO

(Looking at his watch)

Gentlemen, I cannot wait much

longer...

SPEAKER

(To Bob)

Would you mind calling your father

again?

MEMBERS

(Singing)

HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the

brave and free...

GROUCHO

(Pointing toward the

individual off scene)

The Secretary of Agriculture was a

little flat...

(He takes a match and

scratches it across

the top of the desk

to light his cigar...

takes a few puffs,

then raps the gavel.)

I move we open the morning session...

Has anybody got a cork screw?

(Looking out and around

at members)

[page missing]

GROUCHO

What's to stop you from digging one...

And after you dig a river, how're ya

gonna cross it without a bridge...?

We've got to have a bridge to stop

people from going places -- then

we've gotta stop them from coming

back.  If you're worried about the

expense we can have a bridge with

only one end -- and if that's a

success we can do away with it

altogether. I'm telling you that

what this country needs is --

GROUCHO

If there's one thing we don't need

right now -- it's peanuts --

gentlemen, what good is a bridge if

you haven't got ammunition to blow

it up... ammunition was never

cheaper...  Right now, you can get

two cannons for the price of one and

shoot twice as far for half the

money...  With every five thousand

dollar purchase we throw in a Big

Bertha... If you don't like her, you

can throw her right out again.  I

tell you no country can protect itself

without --

SPEAKER

I'm sorry your Excellency, it is

that infernal peanut vendor

Chicolini... How can we accomplish

anything with that constant annoyance?

TRENTINO

Your Excellency - are we or are we

not going to discuss this problem -

my time is valuable - I'm a man of

few words -

GROUCHO

I'm a man of one word... SCRAM!!!

GROUCHO

(To Bob - aroused)

Go out and chase that peanut vendor

away from the building -- Get rid of

him if you have to use violence - if

necessary call out the militia and

if he isn't looking get me a bag of

peanuts.

BOB

I've tried to chase him but it's no

use - he won't go -

GROUCHO

He won't eh? - We'll see about that -

send for your father immediately.

BOB

But you're my father -

GROUCHO

Never mind then, I'll get in touch

with him myself -

CHICO

(Singing loudly)

"P-E-A-N-U-T-S"

CHICO

(To Trentino)

How'm I doing, boss?

TRENTINO

Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything

you can to disturb Firefly - Now

what about your cousin?

CHICO

He's working very hard - I got him a

job driving Firefly's car - He's-a

driving him crazy and I'm driving

him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S

GROUCHO

(Glaring angrily at

window)

I'll get rid of that pest - watch me --

GROUCHO

(To Chico - angrily)

Hey you!!

CHICO

All right -

GROUCHO

Have you got a license?

CHICO

No, but my dog he's a got millions

of them --

GROUCHO

(Munching peanuts as

Chico walks over and

stands under window)

What kind of a dog is he?

CHICO

He used to be a bloodhound but he's

anemic --

GROUCHO

Well - what is he now?

CHICO

He's half poodle and half watch dog -

GROUCHO

Half watch dog?

CHICO

Yeh, he's only got one eye.

GROUCHO

I don't know much about dogs but you

ought to be on the end of a leash -

a ninety-nine year leash -

(Gives him a look of

disgust)

Look - what do you call your dog?

CHICO

I don't call him, I whistle.

GROUCHO

What do you whistle?

CHICO

Yankee Poodle.

GROUCHO

I've got just the place for a man

like you but I'm too busy right now

to do any digging.  What do you call

your dog when you want him?

CHICO

I don't want him.

GROUCHO

Well, if you don't want your dog why

don't you put him in a pound?

CHICO

He only weighs ten ounces --

GROUCHO

I can use you in the House of

Representatives.  We need a man who

understands dogs -- and that's where

this country is going to.  Step

inside.

GROUCHO

(To Bob)

In case of fire, how long will it

take to empty this place?

BOB

(After a moment's

thought)

About - thirty-four seconds.

GROUCHO

We'll start a fire --

(Indicating

representatives)

-- and get rid of these microbes.

CHICO

(At telephone)

Hello!...  Yes...  Yes...  He's not

in...

CHICO

That was for you.

GROUCHO

I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to

have a long talk with you...  Now

look here, my good man, you've got

to stop yelling "peanuts" in front

of the House of Representatives.

CHICO

Oh no, I can't do it.

GROUCHO

You don't want to be a public

nuisance, do you?

CHICO

Sure.  How much does the job pay?

(or)

Sure, if there's a chance for

advancement.

GROUCHO

You wouldn't consider going over

Niagara Falls without a barrel?

CHICO

'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara

Falls once.

GROUCHO

Did you shoot the rapids?

CHICO

No, but I shot some ducks.

GROUCHO

If there was an open season for

fellows like you, I'd get myself a

hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going

to make you a sporting proposition.

You give up the peanut stand and

I'll make you vice-president of the

country.

CHICO

Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a

brother who was a vice-president

once and that's the last we ever

heard of him.

GROUCHO

Well, maybe he's still the vice-

president.  Now if I were to offer

you --

CHICO

(To telephone)

Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All

right...  Goodbye.

(Hangs up receiver -

then says to Groucho)

That was for you again.  He wants

you to call him up as soon as you

get back.

GROUCHO

I don't know what's keeping me.  I

should've been here a long time ago.

Now how about my proposition?

CHICO

What other job you got?

GROUCHO

Let's see -- What've I got in my

cabinet besides mice --

(Stops to think -

then very

enthusiastically)

I've got it -- how would you like to

be Secretary of the Interior?

CHICO

That's no good.  I like to work on

the outside.  I must have something

easy.

GROUCHO

Then you don't wanna work hard?

CHICO

I don't wanna work at all.

GROUCHO

In that case you'll have to take a

civil service examination --  if you

pass I'll put you in the post-office --

stick out your tongue.

CHICO

I don't wanna stick out my tongue.

GROUCHO

Well, if you wanna work in the post-

office you'll have to stick out your

tongue.

CHICO

Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I

gotta have a job where I come to

work at eleven -- go to lunch at

twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice

a year I gotta have a six month

vacation.

GROUCHO

I've got just the job for you --

Secretary of War.

CHICO

'At's-a fine.

GROUCHO

(After a moment's

glance at Harpo)

You know, I'd be lost without a

telephone.  Now - where were we?

Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary

of War.  The first thing you do is

buy ammunition -- you buy it from me

and I get 10% commission.

CHICO

What do I get?

GROUCHO

You get half mine and I get half

yours.

CHICO

I don't want to buy ammunition -- we

no gotta war.

GROUCHO

Then we've gotta start one. Do you

know how to start a war?

CHICO

Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult

somebody.

GROUCHO

My card.

CHICO

(Laughing)

That's a-no good.  You gotta insult

somebody from another country.  Look --

(Puts his large gloves

on the desk)

I come from one country.  You come

from another country.  I say something

you don't like.  You say something I

don't like - and I'm insulted.

GROUCHO

Why wasn't I insulted?

CHICO

You was insulted, but you don't know

it.

GROUCHO

(Indignantly)

Then I demand an apology!

CHICO

That's a-no good.  If I apologize we

no got a war.  Look -- I send you a

scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap

of paper -- and we have a scrap.

GROUCHO

You've got a brain after all - and

how you get along without it is

amazing to me -- Now, who can I

insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...

(Enthusiastically)

AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?

CHICO

He's-a very easy to insult --  I say

something to his niece once, and he

slapped my face.

GROUCHO

Why didn't his niece slap your face?

CHICO

She did.

GROUCHO

What did you say to her?

GROUCHO

You're lucky I don't slap your face --

you oughtta be ashamed of yourself.

Where did you hear that story?

CHICO

You told it to me.

GROUCHO

(Puzzled for a moment)

Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should

have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face

when she told it to me... I'm going

right out and find Trentino.  You go

right out and get yourself an army.

GROUCHO

Wait a minute.  What kind of an army

do you think we oughtta have?

CHICO

I think we oughtta have a standing

army, so we can save money on chairs.

GROUCHO

To Mrs. Teasdale's residence!

GROUCHO

This is the fifth trip I've made

today and I haven't been anywhere

yet.

FADES OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "B"

SEQUENCE "C"

GUARD'S VOICE

(From off scene)

His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly!

GUESTS

(Singing)

HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the

brave and free...

TRENTINO'S VOICE

Can't you see, Gloria, our marriage

would not only unite two great

families...

TRENTINO

(Continuing)

...but would further cement the

relations of our countries.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Fluttering with

excitement)

Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed

honored...

(Falteringly)

But you see - well - I --

TRENTINO

(Repressing his anger -

coldly)

Oh.  Then there his somebody else?

MRS. TEASDALE

Well no -- not exactly -- but --

TRENTINO

(Impatiently)

Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I

won't be put off!  I love you!  I

want you!

(Taking her hand

pleadingly)

Can't you see that I'm at your feet?

GROUCHO

(To Trentino)

When you get through with her feet,

you can start on mine.  I haven't

been to a chiropodist in two years...

(To CAMERA)

If that's not an insult, I don't

know what is.

(Turns to Gloria)

Gloria, I love you.  I --

TRENTINO

(Furious, to Gloria)

Can't we go some place where we can

be alone?

GROUCHO

(To Mrs. Teasdale)

What can this mug offer you?  Wealth

and family.  I can't give you

wealth...

(Archly lifting his

eyebrow)

...but we can have a little family

of our own.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Coyly)

Oh, Rufus!

GROUCHO

All I can offer you is a Rufus over

your head.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Happily confused)

Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know

what to say.

GROUCHO

I wouldn't know what to say either

if I was in your place.

(Turning to Trentino)

Maybe you can suggest something.

TRENTINO

(Hotly)

This has gone far enough!  This

interruption is humiliating, to say

the least...

GROUCHO

Well, why not say the least and get

it over with?

MRS. TEASDALE

(Fearful)

Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!

TRENTINO

(Half addressing Mrs.

Teasdale)

I didn't come here to be insulted.

GROUCHO

That's what you think.

TRENTINO

(Furiously)

You swine!

GROUCHO

Give me that again!

TRENTINO

You worm!

GROUCHO

Once more!

(Holds his gauntlets

in his hand, ready

at any moment to

strike)

TRENTINO

You upstart!

GROUCHO

That's it!  No man lives who can

call a Firefly an upstart.

GROUCHO

(As he offers the

card)

Touche.

TRENTINO

(Coldly)

I shall report this indignity the my

President.

(To Mrs. Teasdale -

polite but firm)

Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this

regrettable occurrence will plunge

our countries into war.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Half crying)

This is terrible!

VERA

Uncle, you can't do this!

TRENTINO

(Politely)

My dear niece -- I must ask you not

to interfere.  War is not a woman's

problem.

VERA

(Rising angrily)

It is every woman's problem.  Who

supplies the sons? -- the brothers? --

the husbands?  Who...

GROUCHO

(To Vera --

interrupting)

You keep that up and you'll crab the

whole war.

VERA

Carry out this tragic folly if you

will -- But I for one will not be a

part of it.

(She winks at Trentino)

I will stay here in Freedonia.

TRENTINO

(As a faint smile of

understanding vanishes

from his face)

Very well then, if that's how you

feel about it --

(suggestive shrug of

his shoulders)

My country has spoken.

GROUCHO

Then it's war?

TRENTINO

(Stiffly)

Yes.

GROUCHO

How're ya fixed for ammunition?

TRENTINO

Bah!!

(Waves Groucho aside

and exits)

GROUCHO

(Dramatically)

THEN IT'S WAR!

GROUCHO

GIRL

(To the girl at her

right)

Did you hear the one about the woman

taking a bath?... Well, she forgot

to lock the door... A man came in

and said, "I'm a doctor"... The woman

said, "I'm not sick"... and the man

said, "that's all right.  I'm not a

doctor."

GIRL

(To Harpo)

Look!

CUT TO

CHICO

(To girl)

You look pretty good to me - but

very still need a spy - Have you got

any credentials?

CHICO

(Taking a very good

look)

You got credentials all right.

CHICO

This is fine.  Put it back.

CHICO

I think I better take another look

at that paper...

CHICO

(Looking at the paper)

I look this over later -- now I look

you over.  If you want to be a spy,

you gotta be in good condition.  I

better examine you.

CHICO

(Listening to girl's

heart beat)

There's something wrong -- I think

I'm getting Whiteman's band.

CHICO

According to my watch it's four

o'clock.

(Puts watch back in

his pocket)

Now look -- a woman spy is a-gotta

make love to men.  Come on -- let's

see you make love...

CHICO

Now you feel my pulse.

CUT TO

CHICO

(To phone)

Send in the next girl.

(He hangs receiver up)

GROUCHO

By the way, are you sure we need a

spy?

CHICO

Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no

got a spy who's gonna tell the other

side what we're doing?

CHICO

(To Harpo)

Have you got any credentials?

GROUCHO

I don't go in much for modern art.

Have you got anything by one of the

old masters?

GROUCHO

I'm glad I didn't ask you for

"Washington Crossing the Delaware".

CHICO

(To Harpo)

We've gotta have somebody who knows

how to get secrets from men.  You

know how to make love?

GROUCHO

(To Harpo)

You ought to carry a spare.

GROUCHO

(Looking at Harpo)

We're certainly living in a marvelous

age.

CHICO

(Laughing)

That's very funny... he certainly

fooled me.  He'll make a good spy.

GROUCHO

(Examining tattoos)

If we can't use him as a spy, we can

have him framed.

CHICO

Say, that's a nice collection.  You

oughta have a catalogue.

GROUCHO

Let's take a look at number eighteen.

CHICO

(Referring to picture

of girl)

Say, she's all right.  You got-a her

phone number?

CHICO

(Laughing)

That's a funny one!

CHICO

(To Harpo)

I think we can use you.  Here's a

spy glass... go ahead and do some

spying...

CHICO

He's going to make a good spy...

that's not bad for the first day.

GROUCHO

(Turning and looking

at Chico)

That's not bad for any day.

GROUCHO

(To Chico)

Maybe my eyes are bad - you take a

look.

GROUCHO

You're right about that guy -- I

think we've got something.

CHICO

I don't know about us, but I know

he's-a got something...

SEQUENCE "E"

TRENTINO

This is all Firefly's fault -- that

idiot, that fool...

VERA

I thought everything was working out

fine.

TRENTINO

Fine nothing!  I didn't want war...

My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale

and overthrow Firefly.

VERA

Maybe you can still win the old dame

over -- why not try to --

MRS. TEASDALE

(As she descends stairs)

I'm so sorry I've kept you waiting...

TRENTINO

(Taking her hand)

Mrs. Teasdale...

(Kisses her hand)

I deeply regret the unfortunate affair

with his Excellency, but his attitude

left me no alternative...

MRS.  TEASDALE

(Emotionally)

To think that this should happen

after all these years of friendship.

VERA

Maybe the war can still be averted...

MRS. TEASDALE

(Hopefully)

Oh, if only it could...

TRENTINO

Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket

my pride and do anything I can to

make up with his Excellency.

MRS. TEASDALE

(Solicitously)

Oh, would you...?

TRENTINO

For you, I would do anything...

(Bowing graciously)

VERA

If only we can get his Excellency to

listen to reason...

TRENTINO

(To Mrs. Teasdale)

Perhaps he will listen to you...

MRS.  TEASDALE

Perhaps...  I'll call him...

MRS. TEASDALE

(Talking into phone)

Hello, your Excellency?...  I hate

to disturb you -- I know you're a

very busy man, but I must see you at

once.

GROUCHO

(Into phone)

Why not come over here? -- You can

come in the back way and no one'll

see you...

MRS. TEASDALE

(Into phone)

But your Excellency, you must -- oh

thank you -- please hurry...

(She hangs up phone...

and walks over to

her guests)

He'll be right over...

GROUCHO

(Hanging on to pole --

addressing Trentino)

If I knew you were here I would've

brought some cheese...

GROUCHO

(To Trentino)

So -- you've come to ask for clemency!

I'll give the enemy no quarter --

not a dime...

MRS. TEASDALE

But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador

is here on a friendly visit...  He

came to ask you to patch up the

breach.

GROUCHO

Let him patch up his own breeches...

TRENTINO

(To Groucho -- ignoring

Groucho's remark)

I'm sorry we lost our tempers...

I'm willing to forget if you are.

GROUCHO

Forget?

(Like an injured woman)

You ask me to forget... Why, my

ancestors would rise from their

graves... and I'd only have to bury

them again... A Firefly never

forgets...

TRENTINO

I am willing to apologize...  I'm

willing to do anything to prevent

this war.

GROUCHO

Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease

on the battlefield.  I'd lose my

deposit, besides, I've already ordered

the ammunition...

VERA

(Putting her arms

around Groucho)

Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there

something I can do?

GROUCHO

Yes, but I'll talk to you about that

when we're alone...

MRS. TEASDALE

(Coming to Groucho)

Oh, won't you reconsider...

GROUCHO

(Relenting)

Well, maybe I am a little

headstrong...  But, you know, it's

awfully hard to forget what he called

me.

(Indicating Trentino)

TRENTINO

What I called you...  Why, what did

I call you?

GROUCHO

I don't remember.

TRENTINO

(With a little chuckle)

Oh -- you mean... worm?

GROUCHO

(Smiling coyly)

No, that wasn't it...

TRENTINO

Was it -- swine?

GROUCHO

(Same attitude as

above)

No... it was a seven letter word.

TRENTINO

(Thinking, then with

a broad smile)

Oh yes! -- UPSTART!

GROUCHO

That's it...

TRENTINO

(Spluttering and

stuttering)

Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is

an outrage!  This man is impossible...

My course is clear...  this means

war...

(Turns to go and turns

and yells to Groucho)

You RUNT!

GROUCHO

I still like UPSTART the best.

VERA

(Putting her hand to

her brow)

Oh, this is dreadful!  If you'll

excuse me I'll go to my room...

MRS.  TEASDALE

(Excited - almost

hysterical)

Yes, it's awful!

(To Groucho)

Are you sure you did the right thing?

GROUCHO

Of course.  Who ever heard of calling

off a war after ordering all the

ammunition?

GROUCHO

The plans of war are in this envelope.

I want you to take care of them --

no one will ever suspect you.

GROUCHO

Guard them with your life... don't

leave them out of your sight...  If

the enemy gets those papers  we're

lost.  If they don't get them, we're

lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying

to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs.

Teasdale, you're the salt of the

earth.  They don't come any better

than you...

MRS. TEASDALE

(Modestly, with a

bashful lowering of

her eyes)

Now -- er --

GROUCHO

Well -- they might come better but

they don't come any bigger... and

the bigger the better.  The bigger

the betta you've got on a horse, the

more you lose, and speaking about

horses, why don't you marry me.

Come, come -- say yes and you'll

never see me again.  I'll go 'way if

it means your happiness...

MRS. TEASDALE

Oh, your Excellency, you take me off

my feet.

GROUCHO

(Angrily)

Swell chance I've got taking you off

your feet...

GROUCHO

Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?

MRS. TEASDALE

Why -- why -- of course.

GROUCHO

You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria --

what a beautiful name.  When I was

born my mother named me Gloria --

two minutes later she found out her

mistake...

BOB

(Coming into scene)

Father...

GROUCHO

(Looks up and sees

Bob... without being

a bit disturbed...

remains on her lap)

Take a letter...

BOB

Who to?

GROUCHO

None of your business...  Take another

letter.

GROUCHO

Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen --

Your shipment of sailor hats arrived

this morning by freight --

(Turns to Mrs. Teasdale)

Gloria, I could go for you in a big

way --

(turns to Bob)

However, the rifles you sent were a

little rusty --

(Then to Mrs. Teasdale)

-- and I don't say that to everybody --

(Now to Bob)

Have not received last month's drawing

account.  How come?

(To Mrs. Teasdale)

Your neck is like a swan...  Yours

very truly.  Now read it back.

(Dashes back to Mrs.

Teasdale's lap)

BOB

(Reading from pad)

They'll know I mean business then

they get that letter...  see that

that gets out immediately and that

goes for you too.

BOB

Yes, sir.

(Exits from scene)

GROUCHO

(Turning to Mrs.

Teasdale)

Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd

be crazy to stay here.

If his Excellency doesn't get here

CHICO

He's-a not missing anything.  He's

Trentino.

(Winks at her)

MRS. TEASDALE

(Jealously)

In her dressing room?  Why, what

could he be doing there?

CHICO

He could be playing solitaire, but I

don't think so.

MRS. TEASDALE

What's the matter with you?

CHICO

What's the matter with you?

MRS. TEASDALE

You haven't been still a moment since

you've been here.  You act as if you

I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's-

a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta

new-rosis.

Excellency at once ---

VERA

Are you sure you're not tired?

GROUCHO

Tired!  I'd like to stretch this

MRS. TEASDALE

I hope I'm not interrupting.

GROUCHO

(Still pumping -

looks over his

shoulder at Mrs.

Teasdale)

Take a seat -- you're next.

(He lets go of Vera's

leg - and she exits)

MRS. TEASDALE

Your Excellency, something terrible

has just happened.

GROUCHO

That's all right.  I'll fix you right

up.

MRS. TEASDALE

My purse has been stolen -- the plans

of war are in it.

GROUCHO

(Shouts)

WHAT  ?

MRS. TEASDALE

I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect

the Secretary of War.

GROUCHO

(Still pacing wildly)

Don't bother me - I'm thinking --

What was that?

MRS. TEASDALE

I said - I suspect the Secretary of

War.

GROUCHO

(Stopping dead in his

tracks)

THIS IS TREASON!!

(Strikes a pose -

raising his clenched

hands; then to Mrs.

Teasdale scornfully)

What a fool I was to listen to your

siren song and fall a helpless victim

under the insidious spell of your

irresistible charms --

MRS. TEASDALE

But -

GROUCHO

(Paying no attention)

You satisfied your selfish whims,

while nations tottered, dynasties

rocked and the world plunged headlong

into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --

(Throws her an arch

look)

Not bad, eh?

CHICO

This is-a fine - you do a good job -

you make-a no trouble and you waste-

a no time.  Come on, we take-a the

plans to the Ambassador.  You gotta

GROUCHO

Hands up!

CHICO

(Smiling)

You no gotta no gun.

GROUCHO

Who said I had a gun... Gimme those

plans, you paper snatchers --

Mrs. Teasdale)

will ever find them - sleep on them.

direction of the

safe)

Hey, you never get the safe open

pause)

You come over here.  There are no

Oh, thank you...  Please hurry...

Yes, but I'm not working for you any

more.  I'm on the other side.

child)

Is that so?  I used to think you

were two-faced - but you can't be -

or you wouldn't be wearing that one.

Now - let's talk this thing over.

GROUCHO

(Blowing out a puff

of smoke)

Now -- how many men you got in your

army?

CHICO

Well, we gotta one hundred thousand

men.

GROUCHO

That's not fair -- we've only got

fifty thousand.

CHICO

That's all right.  We let you have

twenty-five thousand men -- and we

both start even.

GROUCHO

(Enthusiastically)

That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.

CHICO

No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.

GROUCHO

Well, we'll let that one go.  Now --

how many battalions you got?

CHICO

We gotta two battalions and one

Frenchman.

GROUCHO

I wish you were still working for

me, so I could ask you to resign.

How're ya fixed for cavalry?

CHICO

I've gotta five thousand men but no

horses.

GROUCHO

That's funny, we've got five thousand

horses but no men.

CHICO

That's all right -- our men can ride

your horses.

GROUCHO

Not a bad idea.  If our horses get

tired they can ride your men for a

change.

(Chico nods agreeingly)

Now, I don't mind letting you have

our horses, but you must promise to

put them through their maneuvers.

CHICO

Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers

every morning.

GROUCHO

(Looking at shell)

Acme Ammunition Company, eh?  How do

you expect to win the war with shells

That's our latest number...  our

sixteen-inch Horowitz gun.

(To Harpo)

Load it up.

GROUCHO

With a gun like that you can kill

some of your own men.

CHICO

That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a

dozen of them.

GROUCHO

Anything else?

(Writing order on pad)

CHICO

(Mentally figuring)

Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen

hand-grenades, three kegs of powder --

and throw in some matches.

GROUCHO

(Writing)

Fine.  We'll throw in the matches

before we make the delivery.  By the

way, how're you fixed for spys?

Fine.  We gotta him.

Sure.

TRENTINO

There's only one thing to do... we

must capture Firefly.

But how?  It's a very dangerous

undertaking.

TRENTINO

(Standing near widow)

Ask for volunteers.  Some one must

make the sacrifice -- someone --

(Stops to gaze out of

window attracted by

off scene roar of

motor)

Here comes Chicolini.  Maybe he'll

do it.

(Walks away from window)

Unless we can make Firefly our

prisoner, we're lost.

TRENTINO

Chicolini, you've come just in time.

We need a man who's fearless, brave.

A man who's willing to die, if

necessary.

All right -- I'll go out and find

one.

TRENTINO

Firefly must be captured at any cost.

CHICO

That's easy, I'll get him for you

wholesale.

TRENTINO

It must be done right away.

CHICO

I can't do it right away.

GENERAL

Why not?

CHICO

I got a date with a General's wife.

GENERAL

Isn't that a little dangerous?

CHICO

(To General)

Not unless you find it out.

CUT TO:

GROUCHO

Boys, I hate to do this, but if you

generals want this war to continue

you'll have to take a cut --

GROUCHO

We can't afford to pay the money

we've been paying. Now I don't want

to lay anybody off.  My motto in

this war is: - "Live and let live".

SYLVANIA

G-62

CHICO

Look!  That's-a Firefly's

headquarters.

(Pointing down)

We catch him right now.

GROUCHO

(To generals)

Gentlemen, the overhead is killing

us.  Everything is going up.  If we

don't watch ourselves, we'll come

down with a crash.  Now -- all those

in favor of taking a cut say "aye"...

ONE GENERAL

(Protesting)

But Your Excellency!

GROUCHO

Carried unanimously.

GROUCHO

Now go right out there and fight.

(To one general)

You go out there and relieve General

Beauregard, and while you're at it,

see what General Motors is doing.

GROUCHO

(To another general)

Call him back -- he didn't salute

me.

ZEPPO

Father, he didn't salute you either.

GROUCHO

(Angrily)

Attention!

GROUCHO

Go out there -- all of you -- and

bring those generals back -- dead or

alive.

GROUCHO

Why don't those generals come back?

ZEPPO

I'll call them.

GROUCHO

Never mind, I'll go after them myself.

GROUCHO

Hey, Junior!

GROUCHO

Get my rifle.

GROUCHO

I'll get rid of them.

GROUCHO

(To Zeppo)

Take a letter.

ZEPPO

To whom?

GROUCHO

To whom it may concern...  Dear

Gloria:  The air has done me a world

of good.  I am five thousand feet

above sea level speeding home to

you.  Can you arrange to meet me at

twenty-five hundred feet?  -- which

is only asking you to meet me half

way.  Don't be surprised if I drop

in on you any minute... Your fun-

loving Dictator.

FADE OUT

guests - singing)

Although it would please me to govern

the throng, suppose I were king and

then everything went wrong.

MRS. TEASDALE

The king can do no wrong!

ALL

came - And let us say that I was

going strong.  She might be stuck on

me, but what good would it be, if

the king can do no wrong.

ALL

(Standing up)

The king can do to wrong!

(Sitting down)

GROUCHO

King Solomon was game he gave each

Girl his name to number them would

make a list that long I'll bet his

Mrs. Teasdale rises.

MRS. TEASDALE

My dear friends, in time of peace we

should forgive those who fought

against us, and so, I have invited

our former enemies.

(Applause)

GROUCHO

(Stopping Harpo as he

tries to fit a piece)

No, no, this is the one...

(Picking up a piece

and placing it...)

GROUCHO

That was awfully good, I think I'll

have a second helping...  waiter...

GROUCHO

If I don't stop eating I'll get

indigestion...

A WOMAN GUEST

(To the left of

Chico... to Chico)

Would you mind passing the salt?

CHICO

(Yelling to Harpo)

Hey, she wants some salt...

GROUCHO

(Yelling to Trentino)

Ambassador, how's the food?

AMBASSADOR TRENTINO

(Looking up and turning

in direction of

Groucho)

It's delicious, Your Excellency.

GROUCHO

That's all I wanted to know.

GROUCHO

I couldn't eat another thing.

(He stands up)

Ladies and gentlemen, I want to

introduce to you a man who is a prince

of good fellows, generous to a fault,

his own worst enemy and a devil in

his own hometown...

GROUCHO

Thanks, I didn't expect to be called

upon... However, in conclusion I

want to tell you that I promised

Mrs. Teasdale I'd marry her if we

won the war.... Well, we won the war

and I'm stuck... to the victor belongs

the spoils...

GROUCHO

In union there is strength...

GROUCHO

I feel that we are taking a step in

the right direction, and that's what

I call balling the Jack...

GROUCHO

Now is not the time for political

temporizing, all interests must be

sacrificed for the common weal...

GROUCHO

All those who want to place their

money on the wheel, step inside,

faint heart never won fair lady...

Money won't grow in your pocket like

the hair on your head and now is the

time for all good men to come to the

aid of their party.
