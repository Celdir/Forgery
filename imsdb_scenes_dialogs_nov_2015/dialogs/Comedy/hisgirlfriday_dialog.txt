SHOOTING DRAFT

1ST OPERATOR

This is the Morning Post... The City

Room? Just a moment, I'll connect

you.

(plugs in call)

2ND OPERATOR

Morning Post... Sports Department?

Just a moment --

(plugs in call)

OFFICE BOY

What's a seven-letter word for --?

REPORTER

Don't ask me! If I knew any seven-

letter words, I'd be something better

than a reporter!

REPORTER

Hey! Down! Down!

HILDY

(with a smile)

Hello, Skinny. Remember me?

OFFICE BOY

(looks up; then a

glowing smile)

Hildy Johnson!

HILDY

(to operator)

Hello, Maisie.

MAISIE

Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?

HILDY

No, just visiting. Tell me, is the

lord of the universe in today?

MAISIE

He is -- and in a very bad humor. I

think somebody stole one of his crown

jewels. Shall I announce you?

HILDY

No, never mind -- I'll blow my own

trumpet.

HILDY

I won't be more than ten minutes, I

promise you.

BRUCE

Even ten minutes is a long time to

be away from you.

HILDY

What did you say, Bruce?

BRUCE

I said -- uh -- I said even ten

minutes -- is a long time -- to be

away from you.

HILDY

Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard

it, but I just wanted to hear it

again. I can stand being spoiled a

little. The gentleman I'm going to

have a chat with did very little

spoiling.

BRUCE

(grimly)

I'd like to spoil him just once.

Sure you don't want me to go in with

you?

HILDY

My job, Bruce. I started it -- and

I'll finish it.

BRUCE

I suppose you're right -- but if it

gets rough, remember I'm here.

HILDY

I'll come a-running, pardner.

HILDY

Thanks, Bruce.

HILDY

Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to

the Lovelorn"?

BEATRICE

(looking up)

Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle!

What are you doing here?

HILDY

Point of information -- what does a

girl say on meeting her divorced

husband? OR:

(What does a girl do,

etc.)

BEATRICE

(illustrating)

My advice is duck and cross with

your right.

LOUIE

A little more round the chin, Boss.

BURNS

What do you want?

HILDY

Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's

no way to talk to your wife -- even

if she's no longer your wife.

BURNS

(grinning)

Hello, Hildy!

HILDY

Hello, Walter.

(to Louie)

Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine

king?

LOUIE

Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm

retired. I'm one of you fellas now --

a newspaper man.

HILDY

Editorials?

BURNS

Get going, Louie. I got company.

DUFFY

Walter!

BURNS

I'm busy, Duffy.

DUFFY

Well, you're not too busy to know

that the Governor hasn't signed that

reprieve!

BURNS

What?

DUFFY

And that means Earl Williams dies

tomorrow morning and makes a sucker

out of us!

BURNS

You're crazy. Where's Mac?

DUFFY

He's on my phone. He just called me.

BURNS

They can't do that to me!

BURNS

Give me that call on Duffy's wire!

Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the

Governor? -- What do you mean, you

can't locate him?

(apparently pleading

to the one man in

the world who can

help him)

Mac, you know what this means. We're

the only paper in town defending

Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow

we're washed up! Find the Governor

and when you find him tell him we

want that reprieve!... Tell him I

elected him and I can have him

impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac --

I know you can. I always said you

were the greatest reporter in the

country and now you can prove it.

Get going! Attaboy!

BURNS

(to Duffy,

sarcastically)

The greatest reporter in the country!

First I gotta tell him what news to

get! Gotta tell him how to get it --

then I gotta write it for him

afterward! Now if you were a decent

City Editor --

DUFFY

Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in

name only. You do all the hiring

around here.

BURNS

Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too.

Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a

civil tongue in your head.

HILDY

I don't like to interfere with

business, but would you boys pardon

us while we have a little heart-to-

heart talk?

DUFFY AND LOUIE

(together)

Well -- But I gotta --

BURNS

Scram, you guys.

HILDY

You won't miss anything. You'll

probably be able to hear him just as

well outside as here.

HILDY

Mind if I sit down?

BURNS' VOICE

I said scram!

HILDY

May I have a cigarette, please?

HILDY

Thanks. A match?

BURNS

How long is it?

HILDY

How long is what?

BURNS

You know what. How long since we've

seen each other?

HILDY

Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks --

then Bermuda... Oh, about four months,

I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

BURNS

(slyly)

Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing

me in your dreams?

HILDY

(casually)

No -- Mama doesn't dream about you

any more, Walter. You wouldn't know

the old girl now.

BURNS

(with conviction)

Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any

time --

BURNS AND HILDY

(together)

-- any place, anywhere --

HILDY

(half-pityingly)

You're repeating yourself! That's

the speech you made the night you

proposed.

(she burlesques his

fervor)

"-- any time -- any place --

anywhere!"

BURNS

(growling)

I notice you still remember it.

HILDY

I'll always remember it. If I hadn't

remembered it, I wouldn't have

divorced you.

BURNS

You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you

hadn't done it.

HILDY

Done what?

BURNS

Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow

lose faith in himself. It almost

gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

HILDY

Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's

what divorces are for.

BURNS

Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned

idea that divorces are something

that last forever -- till 'death us

do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't

mean anything today. It's only a few

words mumbled over you by a judge.

We've got something between us nothing

can change.

HILDY

I suppose that's true in a way. I am

fond of you, Walter. I often wish

you weren't such a stinker.

BURNS

Now, that's a nice thing to say.

HILDY

Well, why did you promise me you

wouldn't fight the divorce and then

try and gum up the whole works?

BURNS

Well, I meant to let you go -- but,

you know, you never miss the water

till the well runs dry.

HILDY

A fellow your age, hiring an airplane

to write:

(she gestures above

to indicate sky-

writing)

'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember

my dimple. Walter.! It held things

up twenty minutes while the Judge

ran out to watch it.

BURNS

Well, I don't want to brag, but I've

still got the dimple -- and in the

same place -- I just acted like any

husband who doesn't want to see his

home broken up.

HILDY

What home?

WALTER

What home? Don't you remember the

home I promised you?

HILDY

Oh, yes -- we were to have it right

after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!

BURNS

Was it my fault? Did I know that

coal mine was going to have another

cave-in? I meant to be with you on

our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I

did.

HILDY

All I know is that instead of two

weeks in Atlantic City with my

bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a

coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age

sixty-three -- getting food and air

out of a tube! You don't deny that.

Do you?

BURNS

Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat

the whole country on that story.

HILDY

Well, suppose we did? That isn't

what I got married for. What's the

good of -- Look, Walter, I came up

here to tell you that you'll have to

stop phoning me a dozen times a day --

sending twenty telegrams -- all the

rest of it, because I'm --

BURNS

Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you

what. You come back to work on the

paper and if we find we can't get

along in a friendly way, we'll get

married again.

HILDY

What?!!

BURNS

I haven't any hard feelings.

HILDY

Walter, you're wonderful in a

loathesome sort of way. Now, would

you mind keeping quiet long enough

for me to tell you what I came up

here for?

BURNS

(rising, reaching for

his hat)

Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch

and you can tell me everything.

HILDY

(also rising)

I have a lunch date. I just want --

BURNS

You can break it, can't you?

HILDY

No, I can't.

BURNS

Sure you can. Come on.

HILDY

Don't tell me what to do! We're

divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're

not my husband and you're not my

boss! And what's more, you're not

going to be my boss.

BURNS

What do you mean by that?

HILDY

Just what I said. That's what I --

BURNS

You mean you're not coming back to

work here?

HILDY

That's the first time you've been

right today. That's what I --

BURNS

(still interrupting)

You've had a better offer, eh?

HILDY

You bet I've got a better offer.

BURNS

Well, go on and take it. Work for

somebody else! That's the gratitude

I get for --

HILDY

I know, Walter, but I --

BURNS

(ignoring her)

What were you when you came here

five years ago? A little college

girl from a School of Journalism! I

took a little doll-faced mugg --

HILDY

You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't

been doll-faced!

BURNS

Why should I? I thought it would be

a novelty to have a face around here

a man could look at without

shuddering.

HILDY

Listen, Walter --

BURNS

(going right on)

I made a great reporter out of you,

Hildy, but you won't be half as good

on any other paper, and you know it.

You need me and I need you -- and

the paper needs both of us.

HILDY

Well, the paper'll have to learn to

do without me. And so will you. It

just didn't work out, Walter.

BURNS

It would have worked if you'd been

satisfied with just being editor and

reporter. But no! You had to marry

me and spoil everything.

HILDY

(indignantly)

I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I

proposed to you!

BURNS

Well, you practically did! Making

goo-goo eyes at me for two years

till I broke down. And I still claim

I was tight the night I proposed. If

you'd been a gentleman you'd have

forgotten all about it. But not you!

HILDY

(speechless)

You -- you --

BURNS

(to Hildy)

You're losing your eye. You used to

be able to pitch better than that.

(he reaches for phone)

Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well,

what can I do for you?

DUFFY

What's the matter with you? Are you

drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!

BURNS

Sweeney! You can't do that to me!

Not today, of all days! Jumping

Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well,

I suppose so... All right. If you

have to, you have to.

(he hangs up)

How do you like that? Everything

happens to me -- with 365 days in

the year -- this has to be the day.

HILDY

What's the matter?

BURNS

Sweeney.

HILDY

Dead?

BURNS

Not yet. Might just as well be. The

only man on the paper who can write --

and his wife picks this morning to

have a baby!

HILDY

Sweeney?

(she laughs)

Well, after all, he didn't do it on

purpose, did he?

BURNS

I don't care whether he did or not.

He's supposed to be covering the

Earl Williams case and there he is --

waiting at the hospital! Is there no

sense of honor left in this country?

HILDY

(practically)

Well, haven't you got anybody else?

BURNS

There's nobody else on the paper who

can write! This'll break me, unless --

(he stares at Hildy;

then a light breaks)

Hildy!

HILDY

No!

BURNS

You've got to help me, Hildy.

HILDY

Keep away --

BURNS

It'll bring us together again, Hildy --

just the way we used to be.

HILDY

That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time --

any place -- anywhere!"

BURNS

Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger

than anything that's happened to us.

Don't do it for me! Do it for the

paper.

HILDY

Get away, Svengali.

BURNS

If you won't do it for love, how

about money? Forget the other offer

and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks

a week.

HILDY

Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --

BURNS

All right -- thirty-five, and not a

cent more!

HILDY

Please! Will you just --

BURNS

Great grief! What's that other paper

going to give you?

HILDY

I'm not working for any other paper!

BURNS

Oh! In that case, the raise is off

and you go back to your old salary

and like it. Trying to blackjack --

HILDY

Look at this!

(pulling her glove

off her left hand)

HILDY

Do you see this? Do you know what an

engagement ring is?

HILDY

I tried to tell you right away but

you started reminiscing. I'm getting

married, Walter, and also getting as

far away from the newspaper business

as I can get! I'm through.

BURNS

(himself again)

Get married all you want to, Hildy,

but you can't quit the newspaper

business.

HILDY

You can't sell me that, Walter.

BURNS

Who says I can't? You're a newspaper

man.

HILDY

That's why I'm quitting. I want to

go some place where I can be a woman.

BURNS

I know you, Hildy, and I know what

it would mean. It would kill you.

HILDY

(bitterly)

A journalist! Peeking through keyholes --

running after fire engines -- waking

people up in the middle of the night

to ask them if they think Hitler's

going to start a war -- stealing

pictures off old ladies of their

daughters that got chased by apemen!

I know all about reporters -- a lot

of daffy buttinskies going around

without a nickel in their pockets,

and for what? So a million hired

girls and motormen's wives will know

what's going on! No, Walter, I'm

through.

BURNS

Where'd you meet this man?

HILDY

Bermuda.

BURNS

Bermuda... Rich, eh?

HILDY

Not what you'd call rich. Makes about

five thousand a year.

BURNS

What's his line?

HILDY

He's in the insurance business.

BURNS

(looks up)

The insurance business?

HILDY

(on the defensive)

It's a good, honest business, isn't

it?

BURNS

Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I

can't picture you with a guy who

sells policies.

HILDY

Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets

the office when he's with me. He

doesn't treat me like an errand-boy --

he treats me like a woman.

BURNS

He does, does he? How did I treat

you -- like a water buffalo?

HILDY

I don't know about water buffaloes,

but I know about him. He's kind and

sweet and considerate. He wants a

home -- and children.

BURNS

Say, sounds more like a guy I ought

to marry. What's his name?

HILDY

Well, I'll give you a hint. By

tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs.

Bruce Baldwin.

BURNS

Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as

that?

HILDY

The quicker the better. Well -- I

finally got out what I came in to

tell you.

(she extends her hand)

So long, Walter, and better luck

next time.

BURNS

(taking her hand)

I wish you everything I couldn't

give you, Hildy.

HILDY

Thanks...

BURNS

Too bad I couldn't see this guy first.

I'm pretty particular about whom my

wife marries.

HILDY

(laughing)

Well, he's waiting in the anteroom

for me now.

BURNS

Say, could I meet him?

HILDY

Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do

any good.

BURNS

You're not afraid, are you?

HILDY

Afraid? I should say not!

BURNS

All right then, come on and let's

see this paragon.

(gets hat)

Is he as good as you say?

HILDY

Better.

BURNS

Then what does he want with you?

HILDY

(laughing)

Now you got me.

BURNS

Nothing personal. I was just asking.

BURNS

After all --

HILDY

You wouldn't believe this, Walter,

but Bruce holds the door open for

me.

BURNS

(incredulous)

No kidding?

HILDY

(trying to keep pace)

And he takes his hat off when he's

with a lady.

BURNS

(over his shoulder)

What for?

HILDY

(shouting)

And when he walks with a lady, he

waits for her!

BURNS

(stops)

Oh, I'm sorry.

BURNS

(under his breath)

Have Duffy call me in the restaurant

in twenty minutes.

HILDY

Allow me.

BURNS

(walking right through)

Thanks.

BURNS

I can see right away my wife picked

out the right husband for herself.

MESSENGER

There must be some mistake. I'm

already married.

BURNS

(you never saw a more

surprised man)

Already married!

(turning to Hildy

o.s.)

Hildy, why didn't you tell me?

BURNS

(again seizing

messenger's hand)

Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!

MESSENGER

But my name --

BRUCE

(as he enters scene)

Mr. Burns!

BURNS

Yeah? You'll have to excuse me --

I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here.

Just leave your card with the boy.

BURNS

I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look --

(he points o.s.)

-- there's the boy. Take your card

and leave it with him.

BRUCE

Mr. Burns --

BURNS

(wheeling around)

I've just told you I was busy with

Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

BRUCE

I'm Bruce Baldwin!

BURNS

You're Bruce Baldwin?

BRUCE

Yes!

BURNS

(accusing to messenger)

Then who are you?

MESSENGER

(falteringly)

My name's Pete Davis.

BURNS

Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is

no concern of yours and after this

I'll thank you to keep out of my

affairs!

BURNS

(reaches for Bruce's

hand but grabs the

umbrella and begins

shaking the handle

up and down)

This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and

I'm sorry about the mistake.

BRUCE

(he tries to shift

the umbrella, calling

Burns' attention to

it, and offers his

hand instead)

BURNS

Oh, I thought there was something

funny... You see, Bruce, you don't

mind if I call you Bruce, do you?

After all, we're practically related --

BRUCE

(completely unnerved

by this time, and

you can't quite blame

him)

Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at

all.

BURNS

You see, my wife -- I mean, your

wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had

led me to expect that she was marrying

a much older man.

BRUCE

(this is the final

crusher)

Oh.

BURNS

But I see, she didn't mean old in

years. You always carry an umbrella,

Bruce?

BRUCE

Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy

this morning.

BURNS

That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I

hope? A man ought to be prepared for

any emergency.

BURNS

Attaboy!

(taking Bruce's arm

and leading him toward

elevator)

Come on, Bruce.

BRUCE

(going along, but

worried)

Where are we going?

BURNS

Where are we going? I'm going to buy

you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell

you?

BRUCE

(a helpless look back

at Hildy)

No -- she didn't.

BURNS

Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.

(as the elevator is

about to pass, he

calls)

Down!

(practically shoving

Bruce in)

After you, Bruce!

(as Bruce disappears

inside he turns toward

Hildy)

Come on, Hildy, my treat!

HILDY

I suppose I can't call this off

without creating a scene -- but

remember, it's your last fling.

BURNS

(hurt)

How do you like that? Here I am being

nice to you and your sweet-heart and

that's the thanks I get!

BURNS

(very sweetly -- he

almost sings it)

Oh -- after you, Hildy!

DISSOLVE TO:

WAITER

Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!

HILDY

(beaming at waiter)

Nobody else.

HILDY

How's everything, Gus?

GUS

I can't complain.

BURNS

(studying menu)

Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef

sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.

GUS

Shall I put a little rum in the

coffee? It's a nasty day.

BURNS

Good idea. How about you, Hildy?

HILDY

(discarding menu)

Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess.

And coffee.

GUS

Little rum in yours, too?

HILDY

I guess so.

HILDY

No -- just coffee, Gus.

GUS

(crestfallen)

Just coffee.

(to Bruce)

And you, sir?

BRUCE

(putting menu down)

Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And

a glass of milk.

GUS

(incredulous)

Milk?

BRUCE

(thinks he hasn't

heard)

Yes.

GUS

(shaking his head as

he writes it down)

Milk.

BURNS

And don't put any rum in it, Gus.

BURNS

(a sigh)

Well, so you're getting married

tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?

BRUCE

Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're

taking the four o'clock train to

Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

BURNS

(it's the Puritan in

him)

Taking the train today -- and being

married tomorrow?

BRUCE

(rising to the bait)

Oh, it isn't like that.

HILDY

(reassuring Mrs. Grundy)

It will be perfectly all right,

Walter. Mother is coming with us on

the train.

BURNS

Mother? But your mother --

BRUCE

No. My mother.

BURNS

(he gets it and

underlines it)

Oh. Your mother -- well, of course,

that relieves my mind.

HILDY

(to Bruce)

Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still

wanting to protect me?

BURNS

(apparently taking

this at face value)

I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy,

but you can always count on me.

BRUCE

(a little cookily)

I don't think she'll need you very

much -- I aim to do most of the

protecting myself.

BURNS

Well, I'll tell you one thing, old

man, she never looked at me the way

she's looking at you.

HILDY

I might have, Walter, but you were

never there.

BURNS

Anyway, I'm glad you two are going

to be happy and have all the things

I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy

is about the best reporter in the

country -- and that goes regardless

of sex. But all she really ever wanted

was a home.

BRUCE

Well, I'll try to give her one.

BURNS

I know you will, Bruce. Are you going

to live with your mother?

BRUCE

Just for the first year.

BURNS

(sighing)

That'll be nice. A home with mother.

A real honeymoon. In Albany, too.

Ow!

BRUCE

Mighty nice little town, Albany.

They've got the State Capitol there,

you know.

BURNS

Yes, I know...

(he chuckles)

Hildy, will you ever forget the night

you brought the Governor back to

your hotel room and found me taking

a bath? She didn't even know I was

in town...

GUS

Well, here we are.

BURNS

(trying to pick up

again after a second)

How's business, Bruce?

BRUCE

Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance

town. Most people there take it out

pretty early in life.

BURNS

I don't blame them.

HILDY

Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must

have slipped.

GUS

(a pained expression

belies his words)

That's all right.

BURNS

I sometimes wish I'd taken out

insurance -- but, of course, now it

doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it

would have been the smart thing to

do.

BRUCE

Well, I honestly feel that way. I

figure I'm in one line of business

that really helps people. Of course,

we don't help you much when you're

alive -- but afterward -- that's

what counts.

BURNS

I see what you mean.

HILDY

Gus, this --

GUS

(winking)

Good coffee, isn't it?

BRUCE

You've forgotten my milk.

GUS

Oh. The milk. Yes.

BURNS

Here's luck to the bride and

bridegroom.

HILDY

(lifts cup)

Thank you.

BRUCE

(looking for something

to respond with --

apologetically)

He hasn't brought my milk yet.

BUS BOY

They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.

BURNS

They would!

BRUCE

(looking after him)

You know, Hildy, he's not a bad

fellow.

HILDY

(looking at him

maternally)

You're so nice, Bruce, you think

everybody else is.

BRUCE

Oh, he's not the man for you. I can

see that. But I sort of like him.

Got a lot of charm.

HILDY

He comes by it naturally. His

grandfather was a snake.

BRUCE

(shaking his head)

If anybody had told me I'd be sitting

at lunch with him -- but he swept me

right off my feet.

HILDY

That's what he did to me. Swept me

right off my feet -- and left me

lying on the floor.

BURNS

Get this -- get Sweeney off that

yarn and out of town on a two weeks'

vacation -- and right away... All

right, Duffy, keep your shirt on.

Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't

know it yet. But she'll be there. I

promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie

to stick around.

GUS

Your milk, sir.

GUS

And I brought you another cup of

coffee, Hildy.

HILDY

Thanks, Gus.

BRUCE

Too hot?

HILDY

(gasping for breath)

No. It's strong.

(quickly)

But I like it that way.

BRUCE

(looking off)

Say, what's happened to Burns? He

looks sunk, doesn't he?

HILDY

(beaming)

He certainly -- hic -- does!

BRUCE

Anything the matter?

BURNS

Just Sweeney again. One of my best

reporters.

HILDY

What now?

BURNS

His wife had twins and he went out

to celebrate and got as drunk as a

lord. They can't even find him.

(he sips his coffee)

I tell you, drink is the ruin of

this nation.

HILDY

(sipping hers)

You said it.

BURNS

So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl

Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

BRUCE

Just what is the lowdown on Williams?

BURNS

It's simple. A poor little dope who

lost his job went berserk and shot a

cop who was coming after him to quiet

him down.

HILDY

If he's nuts, why doesn't the State

just put him away?

BURNS

Because it happened to be a colored

policeman.

HILDY

(for Bruce's benefit)

The colored vote happens to be very

important to the Mayor of this town.

BURNS

Especially with an election coming

up in a few days.

BRUCE

Are you sure Williams is not all

there?

BURNS

All you've got to do is talk to him.

But the Mayor would hang his own

grandmother to be re-elected.

BRUCE

But couldn't you show the man wasn't

responsible?

BURNS

(there's a sly

expression on his

face)

How?

HILDY'S VOICE

You could run an interview that would

prove it. Remember the interview I

wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved

his life.

BURNS

(slapping hands

together)

Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You

could save that poor devil's life.

You could -- but --

(the enthusiasm dies

away)

-- you're going away. I forgot.

BRUCE

How long would the interview take?

BURNS

Oh -- an hour for the interview.

Another hour to write it.

BRUCE

We could take the six o'clock train,

Hildy. If it would save a man's life.

HILDY

No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This

is a trick to get your sympathy. No,

Walter, I've been waiting for

something like this -- but I wasn't

sure when you'd spring it. If you

want to save Earl Williams' life,

you can interview him yourself. You're

still a good reporter. Bruce and I

will be on that four o'clock train --

and thanks just the same.

BURNS

I'm an editor. I know what ought to

be written, but I can't write it the

way you could. It needs a woman's

heart --

HILDY

Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!

BURNS

(to Bruce)

You see what I had to put up with?

She never trusted me! You argue with

her -- otherwise you're going on a

honeymoon with blood on your hands!

BURNS

How can you have any happiness after

that? All through the years you'll

remember that a man went to the

gallows because you were too selfish

to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl

Williams' face will come between you

on the train tonight -- and at the

preacher's tomorrow -- and all the

rest of your lives!

HILDY

(breaking into applause)

What a performance! Bravo! Don't let

him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an

act!

BURNS

What do you mean, only an act? Haven't

you got any feeling?

HILDY

Well, it's either an act on your

part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

BURNS

What do you mean?

HILDY

I happen to know Sweeney was married

only three months ago. If he's got

twins this morning, I claim it was

done with mirrors.

BURNS

(laughs, throws up

his hands)

All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But

I'll make you and Bruce a business

proposition.

HILDY

We're not interested.

BURNS

(to Bruce)

Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young

man. You let Hildy do this story for

me and you can write out a $100,000.00

insurance policy for me. What do you

say?

BRUCE

I don't use my wife for business

purposes, Mr. Burns!

HILDY

Wait a minute, Bruce. What's

commission on a $100,000.00 policy?

BRUCE

Well, at his age, twenty payment

life, a little over a thousand

dollars.

HILDY

And what's the matter with a thousand

dollars?

BRUCE

But --

HILDY

According to the budget, we laid out

that's more than our food bill for a

whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't

want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm

perfectly willing to use him. How

long will it take to get him examined?

BRUCE

I could get a company doctor in twenty

minutes.

BURNS

Now you're talking!

HILDY

(turning on Burns)

You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose

you examine Mr. Burns in his office.

I'll get my bag and go over to the

Press Room in the Criminal Courts

Building. You phone me as soon as

Mr. Burns has given you his check.

Then I'll go get the interview and

you phone Mother that we're taking

the six o'clock train.

(back to Burns)

And no tricks, Walter!

BURNS

What tricks would I pull?

HILDY

Oh, nothing! Of course, you might

cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute!

What would be his first payment on

that policy?

BRUCE

About twenty-five hundred dollars.

HILDY

Better make that a certified check,

Walter.

BURNS

(indignantly)

What do you think I am -- a crook?

HILDY

Yes --- and that's putting it mildly!

No certified check -- no story --

Get me?

BURNS

All right. The check will be

certified. Want my fingerprints?

HILDY

(rising)

No thanks, I've still got those.

Well, I'll step into some working

clothes and hop over to the Press

Room for the background on this yarn.

It'll be kind of fun to see the boys

again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must

be certified.

BRUCE

All right, dear.

HILDY

Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got

that money?

BRUCE

(feeling his pocket)

The five hundred? Sure.

HILDY

On second thought, would you let me

have it? I'll get the tickets.

BRUCE

But --

HILDY

Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm

doing. He'd get you in a crap game --

BRUCE

But I don't gamble, Hilda!

HILDY

I know a lot of men who didn't do

anything till they met Walter Burns.

Please, dear.

BRUCE

(reluctantly)

All right.

(he pulls out his

wallet)

One -- two -- three -- four -- five.

Five hundred. Be careful, honey.

HILDY

I'll be careful, darling. You be,

please.

HILDY

So long, husbands.

BRUCE

(smiling a little)

I never knew Hildy to be so determined

before.

BURNS

You haven't seen anything yet.

FADE OUT:

ENDICOTT

(into phone)

Criminal Courts Press Room... This

is Endicott... No, nothing new on

the Williams case yet boss. Well,

you bet I'm here plugging away every

minute.

(hangs up and studies

his cards)

Up a dime.

MURPHY

(dropping his cards)

By me.

WILSON

(also dropping)

Droparoo.

MCCUE

(reluctantly)

I'll call.

ENDICOTT

Three sixes. Is that any good?

HILDY'S VOICE

It sure looks good from here.

HILDY

One at a time, boys.

HILDY

No, I'm not back for good. I'm just

covering the Earl Williams story for

Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack

of something but will be all right

by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up

with Walter Burns -- far from it! As

a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight

for Albany and I'll be married

tomorrow morning. The lucky man is

Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in

the insurance business -- and when I

say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are

there any other questions?

ENDICOTT

(grinning)

Well, that about covers everything.

HILDY

Good. Now I want to ask you fellows

a couple of questions. Did Earl

Williams know what he was doing when

he fired that gun?

MURPHY

If you ask us, no. If you ask the

state alienists, the answer is yes.

MCCUE

It's a simple story. Earl Williams

works for the E.J. McClosky

Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper

for fourteen years. He starts in at

twenty dollars a week and gradually

works his way up to twenty-two fifty.

A year ago the McClosky Company goes

out of business and Williams loses

his job.

(waving his hand toward

Wilson)

Take it away, Fred Wilson!

WILSON

Well -- Williams goes a little balmy

and begins making speeches on a plan

he's got to save the world. Only he

makes his speeches, usually, on a

very busy street and neglects to get

a license for it. Well, the cops let

him alone as much as they can because

he's harmless and they're kinda sorry

for him. But one day he decides to

hold a meeting right in the middle

of a Veteran's Parade and the cops

chase him. He gets scared and goes

into hiding.

(gesturing toward

Schwartz)

Come in, Dave Schwartz.

SCHWARTZ

His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out

with a statement that Earl Williams

is a dangerous character in the employ

of two or three foreign governments

and the police are going to get him

dead or alive. Somebody sends out a

tip that this guy is hiding in Molly

Malloy's joint. And this colored

policeman, Daniels, goes over to

pick Williams up. Williams has read

the papers, thinks the cop is going

to kill him and shoots first. That

is all.

HILDY

Thanks, boys. That's all I want to

know.

ENDICOTT

Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's

desk.

HILDY

I know, I just want to give him a

thrill.

HILDY

All right, boys, now that everything

is settled, deal me in.

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me

Walter Burns.

(she studies her cards --

then, into phone)

Hello, Walter. How's the old double-

crosser?

BURNS

Hello, my fine-feathered friend.

Thought I might be hearing from you.

What have you got to report?

BURNS

(into phone)

Going all right, eh?

DOCTOR

(nodding)

Fine.

BURNS

(putting hand over

mouthpiece of phone)

Doctor, will you please keep quiet a

minute? How do you expect me to get

any work done?

DOCTOR

How do you expect me to get anywhere

if you're going to keep on that phone?

If you'll just give me two minutes

more --

BURNS

(into phone)

Well, they haven't finished with me

yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt

back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of

condition. They found two new dimples.

CUT TO:

HILDY

How about that check? All right, Mr.

Burns, but remember, no checkee --

no story. Well, as soon as they decide

whether you live or not will you

have that new man of mine call me

up? Yes, sir.

(she hangs up)

All right, boys. Up a dime.

ENDICOTT'S VOICE

Right back at you.

MCCUE

(dropping his cards)

You fight it cut.

HILDY

And up a dime.

ENDICOTT

(studying a second)

I call. What you got?

HILDY

(displaying her cards)

Three bullets! Any good?

ENDICOTT

(throwing his cards

away)

Beats king up.

MCCUE

What are you going to do with all

that money, Hildy?

WILSON

Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany.

HILDY

Oh, I'll think of something.

MURPHY

Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on

the hanging?

BENSINGER

(cockily)

Why don't you fellows get your own

news?

HILDY

Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?

BENSINGER

Hildy!

BENSINGER

Are you back?

HILDY

No, just a farewell appearance,

batting for Sweeney. I'm going into

business for myself.

BENSINGER

What doing?

HILDY

I'm getting married tomorrow.

BENSINGER

Well, congratulations! Good luck!

ENDICOTT

Why don't you use him for a

bridesmaid, Hildy?

SCHWARTZ

Come on, Hildy, your deal.

BENSINGER

Say, who put these stockings in my

desk?

(he turns to the group)

BENSINGER

(makes a gesture of

disgust and picks up

telephone)

This is Bensinger. I just saw the

Sheriff. He won't move the hanging

up a minute... All right, I'll talk

to him again, but it's no use. The

execution is set for seven in the

morning. Get me a rewrite man.

ENDICOTT

Why can't they hang that guy at a

reasonable hour, so we can get some

sleep?

BENSINGER

(into phone)

Jake, new lead on the hanging. This

new alienist from New York -- Dr.

Max J. Egelhoffer -- is going to

interview Williams in about half an

hour -- in the Sheriff's office.

MURPHY

That must be the tenth alienist

they've had on Williams. Even if he

wasn't crazy before, he would be

after ten of those babies got through

psychoanalyzing him.

(into phone)

Gimme the desk.

ENDICOTT

This Egelhoffer's pretty good.

MURPHY

Yeah? What did he ever do for his

country?

ENDICOTT

Don't you remember? He's the guy

went to Washington to interview the

Brain Trust, and gave out a statement

that they were all sane. It created

a sensation!

BENSINGER

(into phone)

Here's the situation on the eve of

the hanging:

MURPHY

(into phone)

This is Murphy. More slop on the

hanging.

BENSINGER

(into phone)

A double guard's been thrown around

the jail, municipal buildings,

railroad terminals, and elevated

stations to prepare for the expected

general uprising of radicals at the

hour of execution.

MURPHY

(into phone)

Ready? The Sheriff's just put two

hundred more relatives on the payroll

to protect the city against the Red

Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a

couple of minutes.

(consults his hand)

Up a dime.

BENSINGER

(into phone)

The Sheriff has just received four

more letters threatening his life,

but he says nothing can interfere

with his duty.

MURPHY

(into phone)

And to prove to the voters that the

Red Menace is on the level, the

Sheriff has written himself four

more letters, threatening his life.

I know he wrote 'em on account of

the misspellings.

ENDICOTT

Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows

up the Sheriff will still be crying

'Wolf!'

MURPHY

What have you got, Hildy?

HILDY

Kings and sixes.

MURPHY

(throwing down)

That's good.

HILDY

(sweeping coins in)

'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'...

Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's

knee.

WILSON

That's why I keep losing. My grandma

was a modest woman -- nobody ever

saw her knees, not even my grandpop.

BRUCE

I don't know. This makes me feel

funny.

BURNS

Why shouldn't I make Hildy my

beneficiary? I've got nobody else to

leave it to.

BRUCE

I feel I ought to take care of her.

BURNS

Well, you'll take care of her. After

all, if that doctor's right, I'm

going to live for a long time yet.

Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor.

I was a very bad husband: Hildy could

have got a lot of alimony if she'd

wanted to, but she wouldn't take

any. She had it coming to her, but

she was too independent.

BRUCE

Well, I'm independent, too.

BURNS

Figure it this way: I ought to be

good for twenty-five years. By that

time, you'll probably have made enough

so that the money won't mean anything.

But suppose you haven't made good --

don't you think Hildy's entitled to

a quiet old age without any worries?

BRUCE

Well, of course, if you put it that

way.

BURNS

(everything he has on

the ball)

And remember this, Bruce! I love

her, too.

BRUCE

I'm beginning to realize that.

BURNS

And the beauty of it is she'll never

have to know 'till I've passed on.

Maybe she'll think kindly of me ---

after I'm gone.

BRUCE

(a lump in his throat)

Gee, you almost make me feel like a

heel -- coming between you.

BURNS

No, Bruce, you didn't come between

us. It was all over for her before

you came on the scene. For me --

it'll never be over.

DUFFY

(placing check on

desk)

Here's that certified check, Walter.

(sotto voce)

I drew out my wife's savings, and if

this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined

man!

BURNS

(also sotto voce)

Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it

back by five.

(louder)

Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.

(picking up check he

rises)

BURNS

Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified

and everything.

BRUCE

(also rising)

Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel

ashamed to think she hadn't trusted

you.

BRUCE

Well, she'll know some day.

BURNS

That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.

BURNS

Don't want to forget this, you know.

Might start to rain again.

BRUCE

Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away

to get that story.

BURNS

Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting

a good man.

BRUCE

(embarrassed)

Thanks a lot.

BURNS

Well, I got to get back. You can

find your way out, can't you?

BRUCE

Oh, sure.

(he extends his hand)

Well, thanks for everything.

BURNS

Don't thank me. I should thank you.

So long.

BRUCE

So long.

HILDY

I don't know why you boys are so

good to me.

MCCUE

(throwing cards down)

Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy.

Lend me two bucks, will you?

HILDY

Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

BENSINGER

I wish they'd stop that practicing.

HILDY

(turns away)

Well, anyhow, I won't be covering

stuff like this any more.

SCHWARTZ

What's the matter? Getting yellow?

MCCUE

For you, Hildy.

HILDY

Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce.

Have you got it? Is it certified?

BRUCE

Certified and everything. Got it

right here in my wallet... What? No,

he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

MCCUE

Certified, eh? Who is it -- your

milkman?

HILDY

(in phone)

But, Bruce, don't keep it in your

wallet!... Well, you see --

(she is thinking

rapidly)

-- there's an old newspaper

superstition that the first big check

you get you -- you put in the lining

of your hat. That brings you good

luck for ten years.

MCCUE

Say, I've been a reporter twenty

years and never heard any hooey like

that. Where'd you get it?

HILDY

(to McCue)

I made it up just now, and who's

asking you?

(into phone)

I know it's silly, honey, but do it

for me, won't you?... Yes, right

now.

BRUCE

All right. Wait a minute.

BRUCE

All right. I've done it. Now, are

you satisfied?

HILDY

Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

HILDY

Now, darling, you go back to the

hotel and pack and you and Mother

pick me up here about half-past five.

Goodbye, dear.

COOLEY

Hello, Hildy! What are you doing

around here?

HILDY

I want to interview Earl Williams,

Warden. How about a little service?

COOLEY

No more interviews. Besides, a

doctor's coming over.

HILDY

Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?

COOLEY

(looks at bill eagerly)

I think it is.

HILDY

(handing it over)

I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.

COP

What's going on?

LOUIS

This guy stole my watch.

COP

(lugging them both to

feet)

Have you got his watch?

BRUCE

He's crazy. I haven't any watch.

LOUIS

I saw him. He put it in his back

pocket.

BRUCE

I haven't got --

COP

Wait a minute.

COP

(to Louis)

Is this yours?

LOUIS

Yeah! That's it!

COP

What about it?

BRUCE

I never saw it before.

COP

Come on!

COP

(to mob)

Beat it!

BRUCE

My hat!

COP

Get his hat, somebody.

WILLIAMS

I couldn't plead insanity, because

you see I'm just as sane as anybody

else.

HILDY

(puzzled and worried)

You didn't mean to kill that

policeman?

WILLIAMS

Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody --

it's against everything I've ever

stood for. They know it was an

accident. They're not hanging me for

that -- they're hanging me for my

beliefs.

HILDY

What are your beliefs, Earl?

WILLIAMS

They're very simple. I believe in

the Golden Rule. I'm not the first

man to die for preaching it. But if

they would only listen to it -- we

could have a fine, decent world

instead of this mass of hate that

makes man do such cruel things.

HILDY

How would you go about applying the

Golden Rule, Earl?

WILLIAMS

I'd do away with the profit system

and have production for use only.

There's enough food and clothing and

shelter for everybody if we'd use

some sense.

HILDY

(writing)

"Production for use only." Well,

maybe that's the answer.

WILLIAMS

It's the only answer. Everything has

a use and if we let it be used for

its purpose, we could solve all our

problems. Food was meant to be eaten,

not stored away in restaurants while

poor people starved; clothing was

meant to be worn, not piled up in

stores while people went naked.

Doesn't that make sense?

HILDY

(thoughtfully)

Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.

WILLIAM'S VOICE

Just use things for what they were

meant, that's all.

HILDY

Sure.

(she studies him a

moment)

What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?

WILLIAMS

A gun?

(he thinks -- then a

revealing smile breaks

out)

Why -- to shoot, of course.

HILDY

Is that how you came to shoot the

policeman?

WILLIAMS

Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun

in my hand before and I didn't know

what to do with it. Well, when I get

stuck, I know that there's an answer

for everything in production for

use. So it came to me in a flash:

what's a gun for? To shoot! So I

shot. Simple isn't it?

HILDY

(writing)

Very simple, Earl.

WILLIAMS

There's nothing crazy about that, is

there?

HILDY

No, Earl, not at all.

(she indicates the

flowers)

Who sent you the flowers, Earl?

WILLIAMS

(reverently)

Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful

person.

HILDY

(pointing to picture

pinned on wall)

Isn't that her picture?

WILLIAMS

(turning toward it)

Yes. Isn't she beautiful?

HILDY'S VOICE

If you should be pardoned, are you

figuring on marrying Mollie?

EARL'S VOICE

Oh, no, she's much too good for me.

HARTMAN'S VOICE

How'd you get in here?

HILDY

Same way you did.

(pointing)

Through that gate.

HARTMAN

I gave strict orders that nobody was

to interview Williams without my

permission.

HILDY

All right, then, I'll just run the

story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid

to let reporters interview his

prisoner. Of course, with election

coming, that might do you a lot of

harm, but just as you say.

HARTMAN

Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid

of anything. What were you going to

write about Williams?

HILDY

Oh, nothing much. Just that the state

had proved he was sane -- and he

admits it himself. If you don't want

me to run it --

HARTMAN

(beaming)

Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go

ahead, run it. And you can say I

treated him well, too.

(turning toward

Williams)

'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

WILLIAMS

Fine, thanks, Sheriff.

HARTMAN

That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got

another alienist to see you. He ought

to be here any minute. Don't go to

sleep, will you?

WILLIAMS

I won't.

HARTMAN

(to Hildy)

Hildy, how'd you like a couple of

tickets for the hanging?

HILDY

(in a low voice so

Williams won't

overhear)

No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town

tonight.

HARTMAN

(just as loud as ever)

You ought to stay over. You always

wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.

HILDY

That's awful kind of you, Sheriff.

I've got to get started on my

interview. See you later.

WILLIAMS

Don't forget about production for

use.

HILDY

I won't, Earl.

(she goes)

MURPHY

(raking in a pot)

Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't

around.

ENDICOTT

Who's this guy she's gonna marry?

WILSON

Baldwin -- his name is.

SCHWARTZ

I give that marriage six months.

MCCUE

Why?

SCHWARTZ

Hildy won't be able to stay away

from a paper any longer than that.

Did you see her eyes light up when

she came in here? Like an old fire

horse.

MURPHY

She says she's gonna write fiction.

ENDICOTT

Well, if she's gonna write fiction,

there's nothing like being a reporter.

SCHWARTZ

I'll give ten to five that marriage

won't last six months. Hildy's a

newspaper man. She's got headlines

in her veins -- the way we all have

or we'd be out of these lousy jobs.

MCCUE

Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.

MURPHY

Hello, Mollie.

WILSON

How's tricks, Mollie?

MOLLIE

I've been lookin' for you tramps.

ENDICOTT

Kid, those were pretty roses you

sent Earl. What do you want done

with them tomorrow morning?

MOLLIE

(tensely)

A lot of wise guys, ain't you?

SCHWARTZ

(uncomfortably)

You're breaking up the game, Mollie.

What do you want?

MOLLIE

I want to tell you what I think of

you -- all of you.

MURPHY

Keep your shirt on.

MOLLIE

(to Murphy)

If you was worth breaking my fingers

on, I'd tear your face wide open.

MURPHY

What are you sore about, sweetheart?

Wasn't that a swell story we gave

you?

MOLLIE

You crumbs have been making a fool

out of me long enough!

BENSINGER

(rising and coming

over)

She oughtn't be allowed in here!

MOLLIE

(flaring)

I never said I loved Earl Williams

and was willing to marry him on the

gallows! You made that up! And about

my being his soul-mate and having a

love-nest with him.

ENDICOTT

You've been sucking around that cuckoo

ever since he's been in the death-

house. Everybody knows you're his

sweetheart.

MOLLIE

That's a lie! I met Mr. Williams

just once in my life when he was

wandering around in the rain without

his hat and coat on, like a sick

dog, the day before the shooting. I

went up to him like any human being

would and I asked him what was the

matter, and he told me about being

fired after working at the same place

for fourteen years, and I brought

him up to my room because it was

warm there.

MURPHY'S VOICE

Aw, put it on a phonograph!

MOLLIE

Just because you want to fill your

lying paper with a lot of dirty

scandal, you got to crucify him and

make a stooge out of me!

ENDICOTT

(to Mollie)

Got a match?

MOLLIE

(heedless)

I tell you he just sat there talking

to me -- all night. And never once

laid a hand on me. In the morning he

went away, and I never saw him again

till that day at the trial!

MOLLIE

Go on, laugh! I'd like to know some

curses bad enough for your greasy

souls! Sure, I was his witness --

the only one he had. Yes -- me --

cheap little Mollie Malloy! I'm

everything the District Attorney

said I was. And still I was the only

one with guts enough to stand up for

him! I told the truth and the District

Attorney knows it! That's why you're

persecutin' me! Because Earl Williams

treated me decent and not like an

animal -- and I said so!

MURPHY

(finally irritated)

Go into your dance! This is the Press

Room. We're busy.

WILSON

Why don't you go and see your boy-

friend?

ENDICOTT

(winks at the others)

But you'll have to hurry up -- he

left a call for seven A.M.

MOLLIE

(through her teeth)

It's a wonder a bolt of lightning

don't come down and strike you all

dead!

ENDICOTT

(suddenly uncomfortable)

Don't get hysterical, kid.

MOLLIE

(begins to sob)

Shame on you!

MOLLIE

(hysterically)

A poor little fellow that never meant

nobody no harm! Sitting there alone

this minute with the Angel of Death

beside him, and you cracking jokes!

MURPHY'S VOICE

If you don't shut up, we'll give you

something to cry about!

HILDY

(gently)

Come on, Mollie. This is no place

for you.

(she leads Mollie

toward door)

MOLLIE

They're not human!

HILDY

They're newspaper men, Mollie. They

can't help themselves. The Lord made

them that way.

MOLLIE

(one look back as

Hildy leads her out

door)

It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!

MURPHY

(picking up cards)

You guys wanna play some more poker?

ENDICOTT

What's the use? I can't win a pot.

WILSON

(into phone)

Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped

out. She'll be back in a second.

Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll

hang on a minute, she ought to be

right in. All right.

(he covers transmitter)

WILSON

(to others)

Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom --

himself.

SCHWARTZ

What's he want?

WILSON

Wants Hildy -- and sounds very

excited.

HILDY

Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking

on somebody who can't defend himself --

the littler the better.

WILSON

Phone for you, Hildy.

HILDY

(going toward it)

Who is it?

WILSON

Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?

HILDY

(grabbing phone)

Give me that!

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?...

Where are you?... You're where?...

How did that happen?...

(she listens

unbelievingly a second)

I'll be right over!

MURPHY

Boy, did you see her go?

ENDICOTT

Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.

WILSON

I told you Baldwin was in trouble.

MCCUE

Probably went out without his hankie

and wants Mamma to wipe his nose.

SCHWARTZ

I still give that marriage six months.

DISSOLVE TO:

BENSINGER

Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's

offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff

Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How

about that favor? You know what:

once and for all, will you hang this

guy at five A.M. instead of seven?

It won't hurt you and we can make

the City Edition.

HARTMAN

(indignantly)

Once and for all, I'm not going to

hang anybody except at the legal

hour... What? Don't threaten me,

Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any

newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up!

(he hangs up; an

afterthought -- he

calls up operator)

And, operator, I told you not to

disturb me! I don't care who calls --

I don't want to be disturbed again

till I tell you!

(he hangs up -- turns

to somebody o.s. and

speaks)

How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer?

Want me to hang williams at their

convenience!

EGELHOFFER

The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the

scum of modern civilization.

HARTMAN

You said it!

EGELHOFFER

They're always after me for

interviews.

HARTMAN

Me, too.

EGELHOFFER

(fencing)

Of course, I sort of promised them I

would give out a statement when I

got through here. You don't mind?

HARTMAN

(not liking it)

Well, I don't know if that's ethical.

You see, all statements are supposed

to come from me.

EGELHOFFER

(he'll bargain)

We'll have to satisfy them. What

would you say to giving them a joint

interview? I could give them some of

the psychological aspects of the

case and you could give them the

legal aspects.

HARTMAN

(he buys)

A joint interview, eh? That might be

all right. We could have our pictures

taken together, Doctor.

EGELHOFFER

Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a

very good picture, though.

HARTMAN

It doesn't matter. The publicity's

the main thing.

EGELHOFFER

Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.

WILLIAMS

(just a spectator up

to now)

Are you gentlemen all through with

me?

EGELHOFFER

Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were

here. No, Mr. Williams, we still

have some questions for you. Sheriff,

will you kindly extinguish the lights?

EGELHOFFER

You know you are to be executed, Mr.

Williams. Who do you feel is

responsible for that?

WILLIAMS

The system. But I'm not afraid to

die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I

believe.

EGELHOFFER

I see. You realize, however, that

you committed a crime?

WILLIAMS

In a legal sense, yes. But not

actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I

didn't do anything.

DISSOLVE TO:

BRUCE

I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

I never stole a watch in my life.

HILDY

I know you didn't, Bruce.

HILDY

(to lieutenant)

Let him out of here, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT

(conciliatingly)

But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of

stealing a watch. And they found the

watch on him.

HILDY

And who accused him? Diamond Louis!

One of the worst crooks in town! Why

don't you arrest Louis instead of

innocent people that he frames?

LIEUTENANT

Now, Hildy --

HILDY

Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let

him out?

LIEUTENANT

I can't.

HILDY

All right. You can't. But tomorrow

the Post will run the story of that

roulette game on 43rd Street that

your brother-in-law runs. And we'll

print that you get five hundred a

month for forgetting about it!

LIEUTENANT

Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't

let him out.

HILDY

You can let him out on bail, can't

you?

LIEUTENANT

Five hundred dollars.

HILDY

You'll take fifty and like it!

LIEUTENANT

(wavers)

Well, all right. But I'm liable to

get into a jam.

HILDY

You'll get into a worse one if you

don't.

DISSOLVE TO:

HILDY

What's the matter?

BRUCE

I lost my wallet.

HILDY

(stops)

The check, Bruce!

BRUCE

That's right here. Gee, it was lucky

your telling me about that old

newspaper superstition.

HILDY

(taking check and

putting it away)

Yes, wasn't it?

BRUCE

I can't imagine who did it. I can't

think of any enemies I have.

HILDY

(looking at him fondly)

I'm sure you haven't any.

BRUCE

For a minute, I thought maybe Walter

Burns was at the back of it. But

then I realized he couldn't have

been.

HILDY

Oh, no. How could you ever think of

such a thing?

BRUCE

Oh, I realized right away. He's really

a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found

that out.

HILDY

Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're

taking that next train -- and when I

say next train, this time I mean it!

BRUCE

Did you finish the interview?

HILDY

(to driver)

The Criminal Courts Building.

HILDY

(to Bruce)

No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right

with Walter.

BRUCE

But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that

insurance business -- and you promised --

HILDY

Well, the story's practically

finished. I'll just go upstairs and

send it over with a messenger.

HILDY

No, you stay here. I'm not taking

any more chances. I'll be down in

three minutes -- and don't you dare

move!

DISSOLVE TO:

SCHWARTZ

(reading)

"But the State has a production for

use plan, too. It has a gallows and

at seven A.M., unless a miracle

occurs, that gallows will be used to

separate the soul of Earl Williams

from his body. And out of Molly

Malloy's life will go the one kindly

soul she ever knew --"

(he stops)

That's as far as Hildy got. But, I

ask you, can that girl write an

interview?

BENSINGER

I don't think it's very ethical

reading other people's stuff.

ENDICOTT

Don't give us that ethics stuff.

You'll be the only one who'll swipe

any of it.

SCHWARTZ

I still say anybody that writes like

that ain't going to give it up

permanently to sew sox for a guy in

the insurance business. Now I give

that marriage three months and I'm

laying three to one. Any takers?

HILDY'S VOICE

I'll take that bet.

HILDY

(going to her phone)

It's getting so a girl can't step

out of the room without being

discussed by a bunch of old ladies.

(into phone; her voice

assumes a silken

quality)

Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns,

please.

SCHWARTZ

(embarrassed)

Well, Hildy, we were only saying

that a swell reporter like you

wouldn't give this up so easily.

HILDY

(into phone)

This is Hildy Johnson...

(to Schwartz)

Oh, I can give it up all right.

Without a single quiver. I'm going

to live like a human being -- not

like you rats.

(into phone)

Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I

didn't mean "dear." That was just

habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself,

Walter. I've got some news for you...

Yes, I got the interview, but I've

got some news that's more important.

HILDY

Better get a pencil out and write it

down. All ready?

(then with a sudden

change of pace)

Get this, you double-crossing

chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any

interview and there ain't gonna be

any story... Huh? That certified

check of yours is leaving with me in

twenty minutes. And if I ever see

you again, it's going to be just too

bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know

what I'm angry about, do you? If you

come over I'll be very glad to tell

you the story of Louie's watch. I

dare you to come over, you -- you --

skunk in sheep's clothing! And bring

that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll

need him.

HILDY

...And I just want you to listen to

one more thing.

HILDY

Hear that? That's the interview I

wrote... Yes, I know we made a

bargain. I just said I'd write it --

I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.

Yes, it's all in little pieces now,

Walter, and I hope to do the same

for you some time!

HILDY

And that's my farewell to the

newspaper game. I'm going to live a

normal life and have a home.

HILDY

I'm going to be a woman, not a

newsgetting machine. I'm going to

have babies and nurse them and love

them and give 'em cod liver oil and

worry about their new teeth -- and

the minute I catch one of them even

looking at a newspaper, I'm going to

brain him! Where's my hat?

SCHWARTZ

(subdued tones)

Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still

here.

HILDY

(stopping midway to

her hat)

I'll take it.

(she comes over to

phone)

What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't

you understand English? -- Why, your

language is shocking, Mr. Burns --

positively shocking! I don't mind

because I was married to you and

know what to expect, but suppose

Central is listening in... Oh, did

you hear that, Central? We ought to

report him, don't you think?... Oh,

fooey on you!

HILDY

Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.

WILLIAMS

I hope you're pretty nearly through

with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little

fatigued.

HARTMAN

Yeah, you don't want to tire him

out, Doctor.

EGELHOFFER

Just one thing more. I'd like to

reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May

I have your gun, please, Sheriff?

HARTMAN

I don't know --

EGELHOFFER

(insistently)

Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't

strike in the same place twice.

Nothing's going to happen.

EGELHOFFER

Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie

Malloy, in whose room you were. You

will be Earl Williams. And I will be

the policeman. Follow me, Mr.

Williams?

WILLIAMS

Yes, sir.

EGELHOFFER

So -- now I say to you: 'Earl

Williams, you are under arrest!' and

you point your gun at me.

WILLIAMS

(hesitantly)

Well, it wasn't exactly that way --

EGELHOFFER

(insistently)

Point the gun at me!

EGELHOFFER

Then what did you do?

WILLIAMS

(pathetically)

Now can I go, please?

VOICE

Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened?

ENDICOTT

Goodbye, Yonson.

MCCUE

So long, Hildy.

MURPHY

Send us a postcard, kid.

SCHWARTZ

Who'll keep the lamp in the window

for you.

BENSINGER

Goodbye, Hildy.

HILDY

Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When

you're crawling up fire escapes,

getting kicked out of front doors,

and eating Christmas dinners in one-

armed joints, don't forget your pal,

Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my

husband sells insurance!

HILDY

"It takes a heap o' livin' to make a

house a home."

VOICES FROM COURTYARD

Get the riot guns! Spread out, you

fellows! Etc.

WILSON

There's a jail-break!

MURPHY

(at window,

simultaneously)

Cooley! What's the matter What's

happened?

VOICES FROM YARD

Watch the gate! He's probably trying

the gate!

ENDICOTT

(out the window)

Who got away? Who was it?

VOICE OUTSIDE

Earl... Williams!!!

THE REPORTERS

Who? Who'd he say? Earl Williams! It

was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc.

MCCUE

Holy ---! Gimme that telephone!

(works hook frantically)

Hurry! Hurry up! This is important!

MCCUE

(screaming)

Look out!

MURPHY

(out the window)

Look out where you're aiming, will

you?

HILDY

Ahhh --

HILDY

Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns --

quick! Hildy Johnson calling.

HILDY

Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just

escaped from the County Jail. Yep...

yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on

the job!

HILDY

Cooley, I want to talk to you.

COOLEY

(trying to get up)

Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I --

Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has

escaped --

HILDY

There's money in it, Cooley.

COOLEY

I can't Hildy. It means my job! It

means --

HILDY

(interrupting him)

A lot of money.

(she opens her bag)

Four hundred and fifty dollars --

COOLEY

How much?

HILDY

Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is

it a deal?

COOLEY

It's a deal. Let me up.

COOLEY

Let's see the money.

HILDY

(money still in her

hand)

First we talk. How did Earl Williams

get that gun?

COOLEY

Come on, and I'll tell you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ENDICOTT

(into phone)

Endicott talking.

ENDICOTT

(into phone)

No -- nobody knows where he got the

gun, but I think Mollie Malloy

smuggled it in to him. He ran up the

fire-escape, and went back in the

infirmary window. Then he got out

through the skylight. He must have

slid down the rain-pipe to the street.

MURPHY'S VOICE

Gimme the Desk.

ENDICOTT

No, I tell you! Nobody knows where

he got it.

MURPHY

The Crime Commission has offered a

reward of ten thousand dollars for

Williams' capture.

ENDICOTT

Call you back.

MURPHY

No clue yet as to Earl Williams'

whereabouts. Here's a little feature

though: There's been an accident

about a tear bomb --

WILSON

(into phone)

Wilson talking.

MURPHY

Yeah -- tear bomb. Criminals cry for

it.

HARTMAN

If the Mayor wants me, he knows where

I am.

MURPHY

(into phone)

This tear bomb went off unexpectedly

in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's

Bombing Squad.

HARTMAN

What went off?

MURPHY

(into phone)

Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs

were rushed to the hospital --

HARTMAN

A fine fair-weather friend you are!

MURPHY

(remorselessly, into

phone)

The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who

is the Mayor's brother-in-law --

HARTMAN

After all I've done for you --

MURPHY

(continuing)

Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle

on his mother's side --

WILSON

(into phone)

Hello, Jim? Sidelights on Sheriff

Hartman's manhunt.

MURPHY

(into phone)

William Lungren, who is the Sheriff's

landlord, and Lester Bartow who

married the Sheriff's niece. You

remember, the very homely dame. Call

you back.

WILSON

(into phone)

Mrs. William Tausig, age fifty-five,

scrub lady, while at work scrubbing

the eighth floor of the Commerce

Building, was shot in the left leg

by one of Sheriff Hartman's deputies.

HILDY

There goes another scrub lady.

WILSON

(into phone)

I'll go right after it.

MURPHY

(to Hildy)

Any dope yet on how he got out?

HILDY

From all I can get the Sheriff let

him out so's he could vote for him.

HARTMAN

I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy

Johnson.

MURPHY

How do you suppose Williams got that

gun?

HILDY

(into phone)

Give me Walter Burns -- quick --

HILDY

(picking up phone)

Walter, listen. I've got the inside

story on how Williams got the gun

and escaped.

BURNS

Exclusive? That's great.

HILDY

It cost me four hundred and fifty

bucks to tear it out of Cooley.

BURNS

Never mind that. What's the story?

HILDY

Never mind it? That's not my money!

That's Bruce's money!

BURNS

You'll get it. Now what's the story?

(he raises his hand)

I'll have the paper send the money

right down to you. I swear it on my

mother's grave.

HILDY

Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

BURNS

I meant on my grandmother's grave.

Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's

the story?!

HILDY

Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer,

from New York, decides to make

Williams re-enact the crime --

HILDY

Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the

Professor had to have a gun to re-

enact the crime with -- and who do

you suppose supplied it? Nobody else

but that great thinker, Sheriff

Hartman!

BURNS

(laughing)

No kidding, Hildy.

(suspiciously)

Say, this isn't a rib?

HILDY

No, this is on the level, Walter.

I'm not good enough to make this one

up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the

Professor, the Professor gave it to

Earl, and Earl gave it right back to

the Professor -- right in the stomach!

Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly.

They took him to the County Hospital

where they're afraid he'll recover.

BURNS

That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh,

will you stop worrying about the

money? I'll see you get it in fifteen

minutes.

HILDY

It better be fifteen minutes, because

Bruce is waiting downstairs in a

taxicab and that meter's clicking

away to beat the band.

BURNS

Hold on a minute.

BURNS

(his hand carefully

over receiver of

phone)

Come here. There's a guy waiting in

a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts

building. His name is Bruce Baldwin.

Can you do your stuff?

BLONDE

I've never flopped on you, have I?

BURNS

Then scram! You've got about two

minutes.

BURNS

(into phone)

Sorry to keep you waiting. How much

was it again? Four hundred and fifty

dollars? Hang on a second.

BURNS

(to Louis)

I need four hundred and fifty dollars

in counterfeit money. You know where

I can get it?

LOUIS

It's awful funny -- I happen to have

some on me.

BURNS

(into phone)

It's coming right over. I'm sending

it over with Louis. Thanks for the

story and good luck on your honeymoon.

HILDY

Keep the thanks, but just see that

the money gets here!

MCCUE

Hello, Hildy. I thought you were

gone.

HILDY

I thought so, too.

MCCUE

(into phone)

McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe,

eight-sixty-one and a half South

State Street, colored, gave birth to

a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with

Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad

acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was

walking along the street when all of

a sudden she began -- that's right.

So the police coaxed her into the

patrol wagon and they started a race

with the stork. When the pickaninny

was born the Rifle Squad examined

him carefully to see if it was Earl

Williams who they knew was hiding

somewhere.

MCCUE

(to Hildy)

Did you get that, Hildy?

HILDY

No -- what?

HILDY

Hello -- Bruce! I thought you were

downstairs in a -- What? Arrested

again! What for this time, Bruce?

Mashing! Oh, Bruce, can't I leave

you alone for three minutes even?

Well, where are you? The 27th

Precinct? All right, I'll be right

over --

(she breaks off and

looks down at her

bag on the desk)

I'll be over in twenty minutes, Bruce.

(she hangs up)

If I ever see Walter Burns --

(she picks up phone

and dials viciously)

Get me Walter Burns... Hildy Johnson!

Well, he was there just a minute

ago! Have him call me back!

HILDY

(to McCue)

If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire

for me, will you? I'll be right back.

(she goes out)

MCCUE

Okay, Hildy.

(into phone)

Well, we can't get any official

statement --

MCCUE

(into phone)

Oh, wait a minute -- here's the Mayor.

Maybe he'll give us one.

MAYOR

Don't pester me now, please. I got a

lot on my mind.

MCCUE

(into phone)

His Honor won't say anything.

MAYOR

(to McCue)

Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?

MCCUE

It's hard to say, Your Honor. The

place is so full of cockroaches.

MURPHY

Say, Your Honor, what effect's this

jail-break going to have on the

colored voters?

MAYOR

Not an iota. In what way can an

unavoidable misfortune of this sort

influence the duty of every citizen,

colored or otherwise?

ENDICOTT

Your Honor, is there a Red Menace or

ain't there?

MAYOR

(to the Sheriff)

Hartman, I've been looking for you!

MURPHY

So have we!

ENDICOTT

What's the dope, Sheriff?

MURPHY

Who engineered this getaway?

HARTMAN

Just a minute! We've got him located.

ENDICOTT

Williams?

MURPHY

Where is he?

HARTMAN

Where he used to live. You can catch

the Riot Squad -- it's just going

out.

MAYOR

Pete, I want to talk to you!

HARTMAN

I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll

see you after.

MAYOR

Did you actually give Williams that

gun?

HARTMAN

(a wail)

The professor asked me for it -- I

thought it was for something

scientific!

MAYOR

Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant

task to perf --

SCHWARTZ

Hiya, Your Honor.

(into phone)

Schwartz calling.

(to the Mayor)

How about it, Your Honor? Any

statement on the Red uprising

tomorrow?

MAYOR

What Red uprising?

HARTMAN

There'll be no Red uprising!

SCHWARTZ

(into phone)

Gimme rewrite --

(to the Mayor)

The Governor says the situation calls

for the militia.

MAYOR

You can quote me as saying that

anything the Governor says is a tissue

of lies.

SCHWARTZ

(into phone)

Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot

statement from the Governor. He claims

that the Mayor and the Sheriff have

shown themselves to be a couple of

eight-year-olds playing with fire.

SCHWARTZ' VOICE

Quote him as follows: "It is a lucky

thing for the city that next Tuesday

is Election Day, as the citizens

will thus be saved the expense of

impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff."

That's all -- call you back.

SCHWARTZ

Nice to have seen you, Mayor.

MAYOR

We've got to go somewhere private,

Pete. I've got to talk to you straight

from the shoulder.

HARTMAN

(beside himself)

Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a

few hours before you make any

decisions. I'll get results. I'm

doing everything humanly possible.

I've just sworn in four hundred

deputies.

MAYOR

Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt

this administration?

HARTMAN

(pleadingly)

I'm getting them for twelve dollars

a night.

MAYOR

Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic

uncles of yours?

(gesturing)

Out shooting everybody they see for

the fun of it?

HARTMAN

(with dignity)

If you're talking about my brother-

in-law, he's worked for the city

fifteen years.

MAYOR

Pete, you're through!

HARTMAN

(stunned)

What do you mean -- through?

MAYOR

I mean I'm scratching your name off

the ticket Tuesday and running

Czernecki in your place. It's nothing

personal. And, Pete -- it's the only

way out. It's a sacrifice we all

ought to be glad to make.

HARTMAN

(David to Jonathan)

Fred!

MAYOR

Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my

Sentimental side.

HARTMAN

Fred, I don't know what to say. A

thing like this almost destroys a

man's faith in human nature.

MAYOR

I wish you wouldn't talk like that,

Pete.

HARTMAN

Our families, Fred. I've always looked

on Bessie as my own sister.

MAYOR

(wavering and desperate)

If there was any way out...

HARTMAN

There is a way out. I've got Williams

surrounded, haven't I? What more do

you want?

(into phone)

Hello... Yes... Hello!

(wildly)

Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing!

This is a man-hunt -- not a

banquet!... The twelve dollars

includes everything!!

HARTMAN

That gives you an idea of what I'm

up against!

MAYOR

(hotly)

We're up against a lot more than

that with that nutty slogan you

invented: 'Reform the Reds With a

Rope'.

MAYOR

Williams ain't a Red, and you know

it!

HARTMAN

Well, there's a lot of Communistic

sympathizers around --

MAYOR

I know it! But they've got nothing

to do with this case! Do you realize

there are two hundred thousand votes

at stake and unless we hang Earl

Williams we're going to lose 'em?

HARTMAN

But we're going to hang him, Fred.

He can't get away.

MAYOR

What do you mean he can't get away?!

He got away, didn't he?

MAYOR

Who's out there?

VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS)

Is Sheriff Hartman in there?

HARTMAN

(relieved)

Ah! For me!

HARTMAN

(as he opens door,

disclosing Pinkus)

I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

PINKUS

(coming in)

You're certainly a hard fellow to

find, Sheriff.

MAYOR

(annoyed)

What do you want?

PINKUS

(taking a document

from his pocket and

proffering it to

Sheriff)

I'm a messenger at the State House.

This is from the Governor.

MAYOR

What's from the Governor?

PINKUS

The reprieve for Earl Williams.

HARTMAN

(stunned)

For who?

PINKUS

(amiably)

Earl Williams. The reprieve.

MAYOR

W-wait a minute.

HARTMAN

(bursting forth)

The Governor gave me his word of

honor he wouldn't interfere. Two

days ago!

MAYOR

And you fell for it, Pete. It

frightens me what I'd like to do to

you.

(to Pinkus)

Who else knows about this?

PINKUS

They were all standing around when

he wrote it. It was after they got

back from fishing.

MAYOR

(to Sheriff)

Get the Governor on the phone!

PINKUS

(helpfully)

You can't get him on the phone. He's

out duckshooting now.

MAYOR

Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you

like that. A guy does nothing more

strenuous for forty years than play

pinochle -- he gets elected Governor

and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

HARTMAN

(thrusting the document

at the Mayor)

Read it! Insane, he says.

(shaking a finger in

Pinkus' face)

He knows very well that Williams

ain't insane!

PINKUS

Yeah. But I --

MAYOR

(interrupting)

Pure politics!

HARTMAN

An attempt to ruin us!

MAYOR

(reading)

Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!

HARTMAN

We got to think fast before those

lying reporters get hold of this.

What'll we tell 'em?

MAYOR

Tell 'em the party is through in

this State on account of you.

HARTMAN

Ah, Fred --

(into phone)

Hello... this is Hartman --

MAYOR

(apoplectic)

And you can tell 'em as an

afterthought that I want your

resignation now!

HARTMAN

(from the phone)

Sssh. Wait, Fred.

(excitedly, into phone)

What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!

MAYOR

What is it?

HARTMAN

They got him!

(back to phone)

Wait a minute -- hold the wire.

(to the Mayor)

They got Earl Williams surrounded --

the Riot Squad has -- in his house.

MAYOR

Tell 'em to hold the wire.

HARTMAN

I did.

(into phone)

Hold the wire.

MAYOR

Cover up that transmitter!

MAYOR

Now, listen! You never arrived here

with this -- reprieve. Get it?

PINKUS

(blinking)

Yes, I did, just now. Don't you

remember?

MAYOR

How much do you make a week?

PINKUS

Huh?

MAYOR

(impatiently)

How much do you make a week? What's

your salary?

PINKUS

(reluctantly)

Forty dollars.

HARTMAN

(into phone)

No -- don't out me off.

MAYOR

How would you like to have a job for

three hundred and fifty dollars a

month. That's almost a hundred dollars

a week!

PINKUS

Who? Me?

MAYOR

(exasperated)

Who do you think!

MAYOR

Now, listen. There's a fine opening

for a fellow like you in the City

Sealer's office.

PINKUS

The what?

MAYOR

The City Sealer's office!

PINKUS

You mean here in the city?

MAYOR

(foaming)

Yes, yes!

HARTMAN

(at phone)

Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm

in conference.

PINKUS

(a very deliberate

intellect)

No, I couldn't do that.

MAYOR

Why not?

PINKUS

I couldn't work in the city. You

see, I've got my family in the

country.

MAYOR

(desperate)

But you could bring 'em in here!

We'll pay all your expenses.

PINKUS

(with vast thought)

No, I don't think so.

MAYOR

For heaven's sake, why not?

PINKUS

I got two kids going to school there,

and if I changed them from one town

to another, they'd lose a grade.

MAYOR

No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain

one! And I guarantee that they'll

graduate with highest honors!

PINKUS

(lured)

Yeah?

HARTMAN

(into phone)

Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen?

Hurry up, Fred!

MAYOR

Now what do you say?

PINKUS

This puts me in a peculiar hole.

MAYOR

No, it doesn't.

(hands him the reprieve)

Now, remember: you never delivered

this.

(rushing him to the

door)

You got caught in the traffic, or

something.

(opening door)

Now, get out of here and don't let

anybody see you.

PINKUS

But how do I know...?

MAYOR

Come in and see me in my office

tomorrow. What's your name?

PINKUS

Pinkus.

MAYOR

(taking out his wallet)

All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've

got to do is lay low and keep your

mouth shut. Here!

(he hands him a card)

Go to this address. It's a nice,

homey little place, and they'll take

care of you for the night. Just tell

'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty

dollars on account.

HARTMAN

(into phone,

desperately)

Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you

in a minute!

PINKUS

You forgot to tell me what a City

Sealer has to do.

MAYOR

(turning hastily toward

Pinkus)

I'll explain it tomorrow!

PINKUS

Is it hard?

MAYOR

No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

HARTMAN

(pleadingly, into

phone)

Just one second --

PINKUS

That's good, because my health ain't

what it used to be.

MAYOR

(pushing him out the

door)

We'll fix that, too.

(he closes the door

after him)

HARTMAN

(into phone -- one

more plea)

Just -- one -- second!

MAYOR

(huskily)

All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

HARTMAN

What?

MAYOR

Shoot to kill, I said.

HARTMAN

I don't know, Fred. There's that

reprieve if they ever find out.

MAYOR

Nobody reprieved that policeman he

murdered. Now, do as I tell you.

HARTMAN

(into phone)

Hello, Olsen... Listen...

(his voice is weak)

Shoot to kill... That's the orders

pass the word along... No! We dont

want him! And listen, Olsen, five-

hundred bucks for the guy that does

the job... Yes, I'll be right out

there.

(hangs up)

Well, I hope that's the right thing

to do.

MAYOR

Now take that guilty look off your

face, Pete -- and stop trembling

like a horse.

HARTMAN

(mopping his brow)

If we didn't have election Tuesday

I'd have this on my conscience.

HILDY

(into phone)

Will you try --

LOUIE'S VOICE

Hildy.

HILDY

(wheeling towards

door)

Louie!

HILDY

Have you got my dough?

LOUIS

Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with

it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?

HILDY

Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut

your throat if you try any tricks!

LOUIS

All right, all right. You can't blame

a guy for tryin', can you?

HILDY

Come on with that money!

LOUIS

First you got to sign a receipt.

(he pulls out a receipt)

HILDY

Where's the money?

LOUIS

Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right

here.

(he picks out money

and counts)

One hundred -- two hundred -- three

hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty.

Now sign.

HILDY

(grabs money and signs)

Here!

LOUIS

Thanks. So long, Hildy!

HILDY

(grabbing him)

So long, nothing! Where's Bruce

Baldwin's wallet?

LOUIS

Huh?

HILDY

None of that innocent stuff, you

double-crossing hyena! You stuck

Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon

on a phony charge that he swiped

your watch, and you frisked his

wallet! Now, give me that wallet or

I'll stick you in jail and it won't

be on any phony charge either! It'll

be for life!

LOUIS

Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't

know what you're talking about --

but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?

HILDY

(grabbing it)

You know it is!

LOUIS

I didn't frisk him. He must have

dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't

know whose it was.

HILDY

No -- and you don't know that your

cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin

arrested again -- do you?

LOUIS

(surprised)

What -- already? Why, the dame left

only a minute before I did!

HILDY

(into phone)

27th Precinct Station House?

WILLIAMS

(pointing gun at her)

Drop that phone --

WILLIAMS

(supporting himself

by holding on to

edge of desk)

You're not going to phone anybody

where I am.

HILDY

(bracing herself)

Put down that gun, Earl.

HILDY

You're not going to shoot me, Earl.

I'm your friend, remember? I've got

to write that story about your

"Production for Use".

WILLIAMS

Yes -- that's right. Production for

use.

HILDY

Earl, you don't want to hurt your

friends, do you?

WILLIAMS

Don't move!

WILLIAMS

Maybe you're my friend and maybe

you're not -- but don't come any

nearer. You can't trust anybody in

this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I

could shoot you from here.

HILDY

Sure you could, Earl -- but you

wouldn't want to do that, would you?

You wouldn't want to kill anybody.

WILLIAMS

No, no, you're right. I don't want

to kill anybody. All I want to do is

be let alone.

HILDY

Earl, there's just one thing I ought

to clear up for the interview.

WILLIAMS

What's that? Only -- you're getting

too near. I don't trust anybody.

HILDY

I don't blame you, Earl.

(another step forward)

If I were in your place I wouldn't

trust anybody, either.

WILLIAMS

(suddenly)

Keep away!

WILLIAMS

(weakly)

I guess I used all the shells.

HILDY

Earl, you must never do that again.

WILLIAMS

Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go

through another day like this.

HILDY

(more her old self

now)

Well, maybe you think I could!

EARL'S VOICE

I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin'

the fella that when he handed me the

gun.

HILDY

Don't talk too loud.

WILLIAMS

(babbling on as she

moves about)

Wakin' me up in the middle of the

night -- talkin' to me about things

they don't understand. Callin' me a

Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's

got nothin' to do with bombs. It's

the philosophy that guarantees every

man freedom. You see that, don't

you?

HILDY

Sure I do, Earl.

WILLIAMS

I wish they'd take me back and hang

me. I done my best.

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!

HILDY

(into second phone)

Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce...

Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said

I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but

something terrific's happened! Hang

on, Bruce --

(into first phone)

Walter?... Hildy. Come over here --

right away!... Wait!

(into second phone)

Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll

explain everything.

(into first phone)

Walter! Get this: I've got Earl

Williams... Yes! Here in the Press

Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry --

I need you.

HILDY

Bruce, this is the biggest thing

that ever happened...

(lowers voice)

I just captured Earl Williams -- you

know -- the murderer --

HILDY

Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce,

the minute I turn him over to the

paper I'll be right down. Bruce,

don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I

can't, don't you realize?

HILDY

(cautiously)

Who's there?

MOLLIE'S VOICE

It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in.

MOLLIE

Where are they gone? You know where

they are?

HILDY

Wait a minute, Mollie.

MOLLIE

They got him surrounded some place --

gonna shoot him like a dog!

HILDY

Mollie, they haven't got him. You

gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to

do something!

MOLLIE

What do you mean?

MOLLIE

(spinning around)

What's that?

HILDY

Quiet, Mollie!

MOLLIE

There's somethin' funny going on

around here.

WILLIAMS

Hello, Mollie.

HILDY

Quiet, Mollie, quiet!

WILLIAMS

(putting out hand to

stroke her hair)

Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing

to cry about.

HILDY

How'd you get here, Earl?

WILLIAMS

Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to

shoot him. You believe me, don't

you, Mollie?

MOLLIE

(coming up)

Of course I believe you.

WILLIAMS

I forgot to thank you for those roses.

They were beautiful.

MOLLIE

That's all right, Mr. Williams...

(to Hildy)

You're a woman. You got to help us.

You got to get him out of here, some

place where I can take care of him.

HILDY

Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk.

I'm trying to think of something

before those reporters get back.

WILLIAMS

Let 'em take me. It's better that

way.

MOLLIE

No -- I'll never let 'em!

MOLLIE

They'll get him! They'll get him!

HILDY

Ssh!

ENDICOTT

Who locked the door?

HILDY

(calling)

Just a second, Mike ---

(whispering to Mollie)

Mollie, I got it!

HILDY

Can you get in this desk?

WILSON

What's going on in there?

WILLIAMS

What good'll it do?

HILDY

We'll get you out in ten minutes.

ENDICOTT

Open up there, will you!

HILDY

(crying)

All right -- all right!

MOLLIE

(to Earl)

Go on!

(shoving him to desk)

Please!

WILLIAMS

They'll find me anyhow.

HILDY

(calling)

I'm coming!

(to Earl)

Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.

MOLLIE

(to Earl)

I'll be right here. I won't leave

you.

ENDICOTT

(giving door a terrific

kick)

Hey!

HILDY

(to Mollie)

Mollie, drop down here! You've

fainted!

MOLLIE

What's the idea?

HILDY

Never mind! Just play dead.

MOLLIE

(spluttering)

Hey --

HILDY

(fiercely)

Shut up, you!

ENDICOTT

Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got

calls to make, you know.

HILDY

Run down and get some smelling salts,

will you?

WILSON

Smelling salts! What's going on here?

ENDICOTT

Mollie Malloy -- what happened to

her?

HILDY

(as Endicott and Wilson

enter room)

Came up here -- had hysterics and

passed out. I've been trying to get

her to come to.

ENDICOTT

She looks as though she's going to

come to.

HILDY

Give me a hand with her, will you?

ENDICOTT

Okay.

(lifting Mollie)

Up you go, Mollie.

WILSON

(into Phone)

City Desk.

ENDICOTT

She'll be all right.

(crosses to his phone)

The Desk.

WILSON

(into phone)

Well, they surrounded the house, all

right, only they forgot to tell

Williams, and he wasn't there.

MURPHY

(seeing Hildy, who

has been fastening

Mollie's blouse)

Hildy, I thought you were gone --

HILDY

Well -- I was going, but Mollie

fainted away and I thought I ought

to do what I could.

MURPHY

Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside.

The whole police force standing on

it's ear.

MCCUE

(panting)

What a chase!

ENDICOTT

(into phone)

No luck on Williams, yet -- call you

back.

WILSON

(into phone)

Okay, later.

MURPHY

(into phone)

Murphy talking.

HILDY

Any news?

SCHWARTZ

Yeah. I was never so tired in my

life.

MCCUE

(into phone)

Where? Harrison Street Station? All

right, connect me.

SCHWARTZ

(into phone)

Schwartz calling... Out with Hartman's

deputies. I'm in a drugstore. You

can't call me back because I'm going

right on with them.

HILDY

Are you all right, now?

MOLLIE

Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.

MURPHY

Sure, Mollie, you never looked better

in your life.

MCCUE

(turning from phone)

Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks

good. An old lady just called the

detective bureau and claims Williams

is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've

looked every other place. Want to go

out on it?

ENDICOTT

Aw, nuts with chasing around any

more. I spent a dollar-forty on taxis

already.

SCHWARTZ

I say we don't go out any more. Let

Earl Williams come to us.

HILDY

A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest

story in two years and they're too

lazy to go after it.

ENDICOTT

It's easy for you to talk. You're

retired. We're still working.

MCCUE

Okay.

(into phone)

Forget it.

(he hangs up)

HILDY

What's the matter with you boys?

Afraid it might rain? If you want to

go, I'll cover this end.

MURPHY

Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound

pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are

you trying to scoop us or something?

ENDICOTT

Something smells around here. If you

ask me Mollie gave her the story on

how Williams got that gun.

(turning on Mollie)

Did you smuggle that gun into

Williams, Mollie?

MOLLIE

I didn't do nothin'.

MCCUE

(crossing to Mollie)

Come clean, Mollie.

ENDICOTT

Better let us in on it, Mollie.

HILDY

Aw, why don't you let her alone?

She's ill!

MURPHY

Oh, you two are pals now -- I think

you're right, Endicott. Mollie did

give her some kind of story.

ENDICOTT

I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We

better hold onto 'em both.

MRS. BALDWIN

Well?

HILDY

Mother!

MRS. BALDWIN

Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and-

mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him

looked up -- making us miss two trains --

and supposed to be married tomorrow!

HILDY

Mother, I can explain everything.

I'll go with you in five minutes and --

MRS. BALDWIN

You don't have to go with me at all!

Just give me my son's money and you

can stay here forever as far as I'm

concerned. Stay with that murderer

you caught!

MRS. BALDWIN'S VOICE

(continuing)

Which one of these men is it? They

all look like murderers to me!

MURPHY

Where does she get that stuff?

SCHWARTZ

Shall we tell her what she looks

like?

ENDICOTT

Wait a minute! What murderer did you

catch, Hildy?

HILDY

I don't know what she's talking about.

I never said any such thing.

MRS. BALDWIN

I'm quoting my son, and he has never

lied to me.

REPORTERS

I knew something stunk around here --

Who says she caught him --? What do

you mean she caught a murderer --?

etc.

HILDY

(desperately)

But I never said anything like that!

MRS. BALDWIN

Yes, you did!

MOLLIE

She never told her that!

HILDY

I said I was trying to catch one.

(to Mrs. Baldwin)

You got it balled up, Mother.

MURPHY

What do you know about it? How do

you know she didn't?

MOLLIE

Let go!

ENDICOTT

Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in

with Hildy on this.

MURPHY

Who you holding out on? Come clean,

or we'll make you wish you had --

ENDICOTT

(to Hildy)

Hildy, are you gonna cross us for

Walter Burns after the way you told

him off?

WILSON

Give in, Hildy -- you can't get away

with it.

MOLLIE

Wait! You stool-pigeons! She don't

know where Williams is. I'm the one

that knows.

ENDICOTT

What do you mean, you know?

MOLLIE

Go find out, you heels! You don't

think I'm gonna tell!

HILDY

Let her alone! She's goofy!

REPORTERS

Look out! Close that door! etc.,

etc.

MCCUE

You ain't gettin' out o' here!

ENDICOTT

Now, where is he?

WILSON

Where you hidin' him?

MOLLIE

I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't goin'

to!

MURPHY

(leaning across table)

Come on, you! Before we slap you

down.

ENDICOTT

Do you want us to call the cops and

have them give you the boots?

MURPHY

Where is he, before we beat it out

of you?

MOLLIE

(backing)

Don't you come near me, you kidney

foot!

MOLLIE

(wild and blubbering)

Let me alone or I'll knock your heads

off!

ENDICOTT

Put down that chair!

SCHWARTZ

Get around -- get on the side of

her.

MOLLIE

(still backing)

No, you don't!

(a scream)

Keep away!

WILSON

Grab her!

MOLLIE

You'll never get it out of me!

(hurls chair at them)

I'll never tell! Never!

MRS. BALDWIN

Take me out of here! Take me --

(a moan)

Oh-h --

MCCUE

(turning)

Get the cops, somebody.

MURPHY

(turning)

Come on, fellas.

HILDY

Gee! The poor kid... the poor kid.

VOICES

(of guards rushing in)

Get a doctor! Take her to the

infirmary! She ain't killed -- she's

moving!

HILDY

Walter! D-did you see --

(gesturing back to

window)

-- that?

BURNS

Yes. Where is he?

HILDY

(comes in to him)

She jumped out of the window.

BURNS

I know. Where is he, I said.

[MISSING PAGE]

MRS. BALDWIN

What are you doing?

BURNS' VOICE

Shut up!

MRS. BALDWIN

I won't shut up! That girl killed

herself. Oh-h, you're doing something

wrong. What's in that desk?

BURNS

Louie, take this lady over to Polack

Mike's and lock her up. See that she

doesn't take to anyone on the way.

MRS. BALDWIN

What's that -- what's that?

HILDY

Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do

that!

LOUIE

(extending his hand

as if to shake hands

with Mrs. Baldwin)

My name is Louis Peluso.

BURNS

Tell 'em it's a case of delirium

tremens.

HILDY

Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen,

Walter, this'll get me in a terrible

jam with my fiancee and I don't stand

so well with him now. Don't worry,

Mother, this is only temporary.

BURNS

Where do you think you're going?

HILDY

Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce

out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you

have to do this to me?

BURNS

(scornfully)

Get Bruce out of jail! How can you

worry about a man who's resting

comfortably in a quiet police station

while this is going on? Hildy, this

is war! You can't desert now!

HILDY

Oh, get off that trapeze!

(indicating desk, off)

There's your story! Smear it all

over the front page -- Earl Williams

caught by the Morning Post! And take

all the credit -- I covered your

story for you and I got myself in a

fine mess doing it -- and now I'm

getting out! I know I told you that

twice before today -- but this time

I mean it!

BURNS

You drooling idiot! What do you mean,

you're getting out! There are three

hundred and sixty-five days in the

year one can get married -- but how

many times have you got a murderer

locked up in a desk? -- Once in a

lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole

city by the seat of the pants!

HILDY

I know, but --

BURNS

(interrupting)

You know! You've got the brain of a

pancake! That wasn't just a story

you covered -- it was a revolution!

Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in

journalism since Livingstone

discovered Stanley for the New York

Herald!

(quickly closes the

door)

HILDY

(slightly bewildered)

Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley

who discovered Livingstone?

BURNS

Don't get technical at a time like

this! Do you realize what you've

done? You've taken a city that's

been graft-ridden for forty years

under the same old gang and with

this yarn you're kicking 'em out and

giving us a chance to have the same

kind of government that New York's

having under La Guardia! We'll make

such monkeys out of these ward-heelers

next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for

them -- not even their wives!

HILDY

(the fire upon her)

I'd like to think.

BURNS

Well, think it then, because it's

true! We'll crucify that mob. We're

going to keep Williams under cover

till morning so the Post can break

the story exclusive. Then we'll let

the Governor in on the capture --

share the glory with him.

HILDY

(excited)

I get it!

BURNS

You've kicked over the whole City

Hall like an apple-cart. You've got

the Mayor and Hartman backed against

a wall. You've put one administration

out and another in. This isn't a

newspaper story -- it's a career!

And you stand there belly-aching

about whether you catch an eight

o'clock train or a nine o'clock train!

Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all

you are.

HILDY

Let me get at that typewriter and

I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg

can write!

BURNS

Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming

streets after you -- Hildy Johnson

Street! There'll be statues of you

in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be

after you -- the movies!

(slapping his fist

against his open

palm)

By tomorrow morning I'll betcha

there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can

see the billboards now. Light up

with Hildy Johnson!

HILDY

Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave

Williams here. One of the other

fellows'll --

BURNS

We're going to take him over to my

private office.

(turning)

Where's our phone?

HILDY

That one -- how you gonna take him?

They'll see him.

BURNS

Not if he's inside the desk. We'll

carry the desk over.

(into phone)

Give me Duffy!

HILDY

You can't take that desk out. It's

crawling with cops outside.

BURNS

We'll lower it out of the window

with pulleys. Quit stallin'.

BURNS

Hildy!

HILDY

(coming to)

Huh!

BURNS

Get the lead out of your typewriter

and start pounding out a load, will

you? Snap into it!

HILDY

How much do you want on it?

BURNS

All the words you've got.

HILDY

(turning)

Where's some paper?

BURNS

(into phone)

Hello...! Hello!

HILDY

Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey --

or is that libelous?

BURNS

Call him a love-child, if you want

to.

(into phone)

Duffy!

HILDY

(calling to Burns)

How about the time he had his house

painted by the Fire Department?

BURNS

Give him the works.

(into phone)

Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the

biggest story in the world. Earl

Williams caught by the Morning Post --

exclusive!

BURNS

(to Hildy)

Fine!

(into phone)

Now, listen, Duffy -- I want you to

tear out the whole front page...

That's what I said -- the whole front

page! Never mind the European war!

We've got something a whole lot bigger

than that. Hildy Johnson's writing

the lead and I'll phone it over to

you as soon as she's finished.

(he starts to hang

up, then thinks of

something else)

Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor

and tell him I want him to come up

here with half a dozen other wrestlers --

right away! Tell him we'll run his

picture on the sport page for two

weeks straight. What? I've got a

desk I want moved. Never mind what

desk!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BURNS' VOICE

(Into phone)

"The Blackest cesspool in American

city life!" Hold on Duffy, I'll see

if she's got any more.

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy -- Duffy!

(clicking the phone

furiously)

Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy

back. Somebody cut us off!

BRUCE

Hildy!

BURNS

What the devil do you want? Listen,

Bruce, you can't come in here now!

We're busy!

(suddenly, into phone)

Where you been, Duffy? Stick around!

What? What Chinese earthquake? The

deuce with it... what's that?

BRUCE

Hildy!

HILDY

(looking up, very

casually)

Hello, Bruce...

HILDY

BRUCE!! How'd you get out?

BRUCE

(the hands-off attitude)

Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

HILDY

Bruce, I know, but I was in the

biggest jam --

BURNS' VOICE

Hildy!

BURNS

For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're

waiting for the rest of that story!

HILDY

(resignedly)

Okay, Walter.

(sits down at her

typewriter again)

BRUCE

I waited and waited and then I had

an idea and wired Albany to send me

a hundred dollars so I could get out

on bail...

(desperately)

I don't know what they'll think --

they sent it to the police station!

HILDY

(she barely stops

typing)

We'll explain the whole thing to

them.

(resumes typing)

BRUCE

I know I got you into this, Hildy,

but it does seem to me that you can't

care much for me if you're willing

to let me stay locked up for two

hours.

HILDY

Bruce, you know I'm mad about you

and stop talking like that.

(calling o.s. to Walter)

Walter!

BURNS

(into phone)

Take the President's speech and run

it on the funny page...

(turns to Hildy, o.s.)

What is it, Hildy?

HILDY'S VOICE

What was the name of the Mayor's

first wife?

BURNS

You mean the one who drank so much?

Tillie!

HILDY

Thanks.

(she types furiously)

BURNS

(screaming)

Get back in there, you mock turtle!

BRUCE

Did you say anything, Mister Burns?

BURNS

No -- I was just talking to one of

the guys at the office.

(indicating phone in

his hand)

BRUCE

(to Burns)

Oh.

(turns to Hildy)

I wonder what's keeping mother? She

was supposed to come down and get

you.

HILDY

Oh, she was here.

BRUCE

Where'd she go?

HILDY

Out some place.

BRUCE

Hildy! Where's mother?

HILDY

Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know

where she went.

BRUCE

Did you give her the money?

HILDY

No, I was going to give it to her --

but she left hurriedly.

BRUCE

Then suppose you give me the money.

Four hundred and fifty dollars.

HILDY

Oh, yes. Here it is.

HILDY

Here it is, Bruce. One -- two --

three -- four hundred -- and fifty

dollars.

BRUCE

(drily)

Thank you.

BRUCE

(to Hildy)

And I'll take that certified check,

too. I've decided I can handle things

around here...

BURNS

Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep

going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

HILDY

Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce,

here's the check... And, oh, Bruce,

here's your wallet. I got it back.

BRUCE

(taking it and

surveying it coldly)

You got it back, eh? There's something

funny going on around here.

BURNS

Hildy!

HILDY

All right, Walter.

BRUCE

I'm taking the nine o'clock train,

Hildy. And you can meet us at the

station.

HILDY

Fine.

BURNS

(coming over to Bruce)

I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise

you.

BRUCE

(dramatically)

If she's not there, mother and I are

leaving anyhow!

BURNS

I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've

got to forgive her. She's only a

woman, after all.

BRUCE

Suppose she is -- I have feelings,

too! Do you know where I've been for

the last couple of hours? Locked up

in a police station and she didn't

move to do anything about it.

BURNS

Ts! Ts! Ts!

BRUCE

And now I don't know where my mother

is. She may be lost.

BURNS

I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to

put every detective in the city on

the job. Tell you what -- go over to

the Missing Persons Bureau and

describe your mother. What does she

look like?

BRUCE

She's -- well, she's very motherly.

That's about the best description I

know.

BURNS

(nodding)

That's the kind of stuff they want!

BURNS

Oh, Bruce, let me see that money

Hildy gave you.

BRUCE

The money? Why?

BURNS

There's a lot of counterfeit big

bills going around.

BRUCE

(worried)

Gee! Take a look, will you?

BURNS

Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just

wanted to be sure.

BRUCE

Say, I want to be sure, too!

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy. Good. Stick close.

BURNS

(despairingly)

Now the moon's out!

BURNS

Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget!

You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough

air?

BURNS

Is that better? Now breathe deep!

BURNS

Attaboy!

BURNS

(looking over her

shoulder)

That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em,

Hildy.

BURNS

(into phone)

Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go!

BURNS

(into phone)

"In the darkest hour of the city's

history --"

BURNS

(into phone)

Listen, did you impress it on Butch

that I want him and his gang here

right away? You did? Every minute

counts. All right.

(puts receiver down

on table)

Duffy's getting old!

HILDY

Where's Butch?

BURNS' VOICE

He's on the way.

HILDY

(over her typing)

He'd better hurry. The boys'll be

coming back to phone.

BURNS

(coming into shot to

peer over her shoulder)

Well, keep going! We want an extra

out on the streets before it's too

late!

HILDY

(looking up suddenly)

Where's Bruce?

BURNS

Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to

get the tickets.

HILDY

What tickets?

BURNS

Railroad tickets.

HILDY

Is he coming back here?

BURNS

Didn't you hear him? Of course he's

coming back here. Keep going, will

you?

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy!

HILDY

(calling)

Who is it?

BENSINGER

What's the idea of locking this?

HILDY

That's Bensinger. That's his desk.

BURNS

(whispering)

What's his name?

HILDY

Bensinger -- of the Tribune.

BENSINGER

Open this door!

BURNS

I'll handle him.

BURNS

The Tribune, eh? Watch me!

BENSINGER

(as he comes in)

Ain't you got any more sense than to --

?

(sees Burns and is

overcome)

Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite

an honor having you come over here.

BURNS

(casually)

Hello, Bensinger.

BENSINGER

Excuse me, I just want to --

BURNS

(starting for the

desk, suddenly

blocking his path)

Quite a coincidence, my running into

you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy?

HILDY'S VOICE

Yeh.

BENSINGER

How do you mean?

BURNS

I was having a little chat about you

just this afternoon -- with our Mister

Duffy.

BENSINGER

(essaying a pleasantry)

Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.

BURNS

I should say not! That was one swell

story you had in the paper this

morning.

BENSINGER

(deeply moved)

Oh, did you -- care for the poem,

Mr. Burns?

BURNS

(startled)

The poem?... The poem was great!

BENSINGER

(blinking at these

words)

Remember the ending?

(and he recites)

" -- and all is well, outside his

cell, But in his heart he hears the

hangman Calling and the gallows

falling And his white-haired mother's

tears..."

BURNS

(overcome)

Heartbreaking! How would you like to

work for me?

BENSINGER

What?

BURNS

(to Bensinger)

We need somebody like you. All we've

got now are a lot of low-brows. Like

Johnson here.

BENSINGER

Seriously, Mr. Burns?

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to

see you.

(looking up at

Bensinger)

Mervyn, isn't it?

BENSINGER

No. Roy. Roy V.

BURNS

(with a little laugh

at his own

forgetfulness)

Of course!

(into phone)

Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course

you wouldn't know! You probably never

heard of Shakespeare, either! Put

Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.

(to Bensinger)

How much are you getting on the

Tribune, Roy?

BENSINGER

Seventy-five.

BURNS

I'll give you a hundred and a by-

line.

BURNS

(into phone)

Let him have everything he wants.

(puts down the

receiver; turns to

Bensinger)

Now hustle and write me a story from

the point of view of the escaped

man.

(acting it out)

He hides, cowering... Afraid of every

light, of every sound... hears

footsteps... his heart going like

that... And all the time they're

closing in... Get the sense of an

animal at bay!

BENSINGER

Sort of a Jack London style?

BURNS

Exactly!

BENSINGER

I got my rhyming dictionary in --

(indicating desk)

BURNS

(getting him to door)

It doesn't have to rhyme!

BENSINGER

Gee, I'm terribly grateful, Mister

Burns. Do you suppose there might be

an opening some time as foreign

correspondent? I parley a little

French, you know.

BURNS

I'll keep you in mind.

BENSINGER

(going)

Au revoir, mon capitaine.

BURNS

(never at a loss in

any language)

Bon jour!

BURNS

Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay --

BURNS

(into phono)

Duffy! Got this!

BURNS

A rat from the Tribune is coming

over to get a job -- Bensinger, the

guy I told you about. Handle him

with kid gloves. Tell him to get

busy writing poetry... No, we don't

want him. Stall him along until the

extra comes out. Then tell him his

poetry stinks and kick him downstairs.

HILDY

(to Burns)

Double-crossing swine!

BURNS

You said it! But this'll teach him a

lesson. He won't quit his paper

without giving notice after this.

BURNS

Tear into it, will you? Don't sit

there like a frozen robin!

HILDY

I'm finished.

BURNS

Finished!

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy! All right -- here we go! And

got it out as soon as you can. I

want this paper out on the streets

in half an hour!

(reading Hildy's copy)

"So once more the Morning Post --"

HILDY

Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter,

you're not trying anything again,

are you?

BURNS

(coming over to her)

Hildy, you think I could? After this

story?

(taking a flask from

his pocket)

Here! You're just nervous.

BURNS

Who is it?

LOUIE'S VOICE

It's me, Boss -- Louie.

BURNS

(opening the door)

It's Louie!

BURNS

(seeing Louie's

disarray)

What's the matter?

HILDY

(frantically)

Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

BURNS

What did you do with her?

HILDY

(almost afraid to

speak)

What happened?

BURNS

You been in a fight?

LOUIE

(still out of breath)

Down Western Avenue. We were going

sixty-five miles an hour. You know

what I mean?

BURNS

Take that mush out of your mouth!

HILDY

Where's the old lady?

LOUIE

I'm telling you!

LOUIE

We run smack into a police patrol.

You know what I mean? We broke it in

half!

HILDY

(moaning)

Oh-h-h... was she hurt?

BURNS

Where is she? Tell me!

HILDY

Louie!

LOUIE

I'm telling you. Can you imagine

bumping into a load of cops?! They

come rollin' out like oranges!

HILDY

(seizing him)

What did you do with her?

LOUIE

Search me! When I come to I was

running down Thirty-fifth Street.

HILDY

-- You were with her. You were in

the cab, weren't you?

LOUIE

(exposing his bruised

scalp)

Was I? The driver got knocked cold.

BURNS

Butter-fingers! I give you an old

lady to take somewhere, and you hand

her over to the cops!

LOUIE

What do you mean, I handed her? The

patrol wagon was on the wrong side

of the street.

BURNS

Now everything's fine. She's probably

squawking her head off in some police

station.

LOUIE

I don't think she's talking much...

You know what I mean?

HILDY

(paralyzed)

Don't tell me -- was she killed?

BURNS

(hopefully)

Was she? Did you notice?

LOUIE

Say, me with a gun on my hip and a

kidnapped old lady on my hands, I

should stick around asking questions

from a lot of cops! You know what I

mean?

HILDY

Dead... dead! That's the end!

BURNS

It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will

be.

HILDY

(wildly)

What am I going to say to Bruce?

What'll I tell him?

BURNS

If he really loves you, you won't

have to tell him anything.

(whacking her on the

shoulder)

Snap out of it! Would you rather

have had the old dame dragging the

whole police force in here?

HILDY

I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh-

h... what can I do now? How can I

ever face him? Oh, I hope he never

comes back!

BURNS

Look at me, Hildy --

HILDY

(springing up)

I'm looking at you -- you murderer!

BURNS

If it was my own mother, I'd carry

on! You know I would. For the paper!

HILDY

(calling off to Louie)

Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going

out!

BURNS

(grabbing Hildy)

You stay here. I'll find out

everything.

LOUIE

(to Hildy)

Western an' Thirty-fourth.

BURNS

(into phone)

Hello -- hello...

HILDY

(into phone)

Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.

BURNS

(guarded)

Who?

(wildly)

Hello, Butch! Where are you?

HILDY

(into phone)

Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving

Room.

BURNS

(into phone)

What are you doing there? Haven't

you even started?

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was

there an old lady brought in from an

auto smashup?

BURNS

(into phone)

Oh, for --

(yelling)

H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's

a matter of life and death! Listen!

HILDY

(into phone)

Nobody?

(jiggles hook)

Morningside three-one-two-four.

BURNS

(into phone)

I can't hear... You got who? Speak

up! A what?... You can't stop for a

dame now!

HILDY

(into phone)

Is this the Community Hospital?

BURNS

(howling into phone)

I don't care if you've been after

her for six years! Butch, our whole

lives are at stake! Are you going to

let a woman come between us after

all we've been through?

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there

an old lady --?

BURNS

(into phone, drowning

out Hildy)

Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for

you -- up to here!

(indicates up to where)

Now, you can't double-cross me!...

She does? All right -- put her on.

I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello,

Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent

glamour girl, you can't keep Butch

away from his duty... What's that?

You say that again and I'll come

over there and knock your eye out!

Hello?

(turning, as he hangs

up)

I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of

'em!

(into Post phone)

Duffy!

(to the universe)

Mousing around with some big blonde

Annie on my time! That's co-operation!

(screaming into phone)

Duffy!!

HILDY

Shut up, will you?

(into phone)

You sure? Nobody?

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy!!!!

(listening)

(into phone)

Duffy!!!!

(listening)

Well, where is Duffy?

(throwing receiver to

desk)

Diabetes! I ought to know better

than to hire anybody with a disease.

(turning)

Louie.

BURNS

(to Louie)

It's up to you.

LOUIE

(loyally)

Anything you want, Boss.

BURNS

Beat it out and get hold of some

guys.

LOUIE

Who do you want?

BURNS

(starting for the

door, followed by

Louie)

Anybody with hair on his chest. Get

'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer

them anything -- only get them.

(confidentially)

We've got to get this desk out of

here.

LOUIE

You know me. The shirt off my back.

BURNS

You got plenty of money?

LOUIE

Sure, boss.

BURNS

I mean real money -- not counterfeit!

LOUIE

I always have both.

BURNS

(calling after him)

And don't bump into anything.

HILDY

Lafayette two-one-hundred.

BURNS

(turning from door)

That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I

know it.

(bitterly)

Can you imagine Butch doing this to

me -- at a time like this?

BURNS

(confidentially)

If Louie doesn't come back in five

minutes we'll get it out alone.

There's millions of ways. We can

start a fire and get the firemen to

carry it out in the confusion.

HILDY

(into phone)

Ring that number, will you?

BURNS

(to Hildy, oblivious

of her telephoning)

Come here. See if we can move it.

HILDY

(into phone)

Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying --

In Hospital? Did you have an auto

accident in the last --

BURNS

(interrupting)

Will you come here?

HILDY

(into phone)

Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.

BURNS

When I'm surrounded, with my back

against the wall, you're not going

to lay down on me, are you --

HILDY

Yes.

BURNS

(going to her)

Hildy, you just can't leave me out

on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be

cricket!

HILDY

I don't care what you say. I'm going

to find Bruce's mother.

(she jiggles the hook

madly)

Oh-h...

(she hangs up)

I'm going out and find her!

BURNS

(coming into scene

after Hildy)

Don't open that!

HILDY

(at the door)

Who says so? I'm going to the morgue --

to look --

MURPHY

There she is!

MCCUE

Say, Hildy...

HARTMAN

Just a minute, Johnson!

HILDY

Let go o' me. What's the idea?

MCCUE

What's your hurry?

MURPHY

We want to see you.

HILDY

Take your paws off me!

HARTMAN

Hold her, boys!

BURNS

(to Sheriff)

Who do you think you are, breaking

in here like this?

HARTMAN

You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't

care who you are or what paper you're

editor of.

HILDY

(struggling)

Let me go!

(hysterically)

Fellows, something's happened to my

mother-in-law.

HARTMAN

Hang onto her! Keep her in here!

MCCUE

We know what you're up to.

ENDICOTT

Probably goin' out to get Williams.

SCHWARTZ

The door was locked.

WILSON

She and Mollie were talking.

HILDY

I don't know anything, I tell you.

There's been an accident.

HARTMAN

Johnson, there's something very

peculiar going on.

HILDY

You can send somebody with me if you

don't believe me!

HARTMAN

I wasn't born yesterday. Now the

boys tell me you and this Mollie

Malloy --

HILDY

Nobody's trying to put anything over

on you. I'm getting out of here and

you can't stop me!

MURPHY

(comes into scene)

You're not going anywhere.

(to the Sheriff)

She's got the story sewed up, Pete.

(indicating Burns)

That's why Burns is here.

SCHWARTZ

We're on to you, Hildy. Let us in on

it.

BURNS

(purring)

If you've any accusations to make,

Hartman, make them in the proper

manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask

you to get out.

HARTMAN

(pop-eyed; stammering)

You'll ask me to what?

BURNS

Get out!

HARTMAN

(to deputies, off)

Close that door. Don't let anybody

in or out.

MURPHY

Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little

third degree.

ENDICOTT

Make them talk and you got Williams,

Pinky!

HARTMAN

Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of

this. What do you know about Williams?

Are you going to talk or aren't you?

HILDY

What do I know about Williams?

HARTMAN

All right, boys. Take her along. I

got ways of making her talk.

HILDY

Look out, you --

MCCUE

(nervously)

What's the use of fighting, Hildy?

DEPUTIES

Hey, she's got a gun! Look out, she's

got a gun!

HILDY

(trying to face in

all directions)

No, you don't! Walter!

BURNS

What is it? Here!

HARTMAN

Gimme that.

HARTMAN

(to Hildy)

Where'd you get this?

HILDY

I've got a right to carry a gun if I

want to.

HARTMAN

Not this gun!

BURNS

(easily)

I can explain that, Hartman. When

Hildy told me she wanted to interview

Earl Williams I thought it might be

dangerous and I gave her a gun to

defend herself.

HARTMAN

Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very

interesting. This happens to be the

gun that Earl Williams shot his way

out with!

REPORTERS AD LIB

What? What's that? Etc...

BURNS

(advancing on Sheriff)

Are you trying to make me out a liar?

MURPHY

(bitterly at Hildy)

It's the last time I ever trust a

woman, Hildy.

SCHWARTZ

Maybe Williams was gonna be her best

man.

WILSON

That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing

your own pals.

HARTMAN

(shoving up to Hildy;

trembling)

Where is Earl Williams? Where you

got him?

BURNS

(sympathetically)

You're barking up the wrong tree,

Hartman.

HARTMAN

I'll give you three minutes to tell

me where he is.

HILDY

He went over to the hospital to call

on Professor Egelhoffer.

HARTMAN

(outraged)

What?

HILDY

With a bag of marshmallows.

REPORTERS AD LIB

Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This

is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought

we were friends... Etc.

(to Sheriff)

Look here, Pete! What about Mister

Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's

he doing over here?

HARTMAN

(grabbing Burns' arm)

Speak up! What do you know about

this.

BURNS

(gently but firmly

disengaging his hand)

My dear Hartman!

MURPHY

Can that! Where is he?

BURNS

(to Sheriff)

The Morning Post is not obstructing

justice or hiding criminals. You

ought to know that.

HARTMAN

No? Well --

(turning to Hildy)

Johnson, you're under arrest.

(turning to Burns)

You, too, Burns.

BURNS

(calmly)

Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed,

square-toed spy -- do you realize

what you're doing?

HARTMAN

I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns,

you're guilty of obstructing justice

and so is the Morning Post. I'm going

to see that the Post is fined ten

thousand dollars for this.

BURNS

You'll see nothing of the kind,

Sheriff.

HARTMAN

We'll just start by impounding the

Post property.

(pointing to

Bensinger's desk,

addressing Hildy)

Is that your desk?

HILDY

(jumping)

No!

BURNS

(almost simultaneously)

Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I

dare him to move that desk out of

here.

HARTMAN

Oh, you do, eh?

(to deputies)

All right, boys. Confiscate that

desk.

BURNS

(trying to intercept

deputies)

Hartman, if you take this desk out

of this building, I'll put you behind

bars.

HARTMAN

You will, eh? Well, we'll see about

that.

(to deputies)

All right, boys. Take it.

BURNS

I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal

offense.

(to deputy nearest

him)

And you'll be an accessory!

HARTMAN

We'll take a chance on that, Burns.

(to deputies)

Go ahead, boys.

(the deputies continue

toward the desk)

MRS. BALDWIN

You wait outside, Bruce.

BRUCE

But, mother --

MRS. BALDWIN

(firmly)

No! You'll weaken when you see that

little Jezebel! I'm going to tell

her what I think of her!

HILDY

(leaping forward)

Mother!

MRS. BALDWIN

(pointing out Burns

to the officers)

That man there!

HILDY

(hugging Mrs. Baldwin)

Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

Are you all right? Tell me.

HARTMAN

What's the idea here?

POLICEMAN

This lady claims she was kidnapped.

HARTMAN

What?

MRS. BALDWIN

They dragged me all the way down the

stairs --

HARTMAN

Just a minute. Did -- did --

(points to Burns)

-- this man have anything to do with

it?

MRS. BALDWIN

He was the one in charge of

everything! He told them to kidnap

me!

BURNS

(amazed)

Are you referring to me, Madam?

MRS. BALDWIN

You know you did!

HARTMAN

What about this, Burns? Kidnapping,

eh?

BURNS

(round-eyed)

Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never

saw this woman before in my life!

MRS. BALDWIN

Oh, what a thing to say! I was

standing right here - after the girl

jumped out of the window.

HARTMAN

Did you get the Mayor?

DEPUTY

He's coming over.

BURNS

(to Mrs. Baldwin)

Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were

out joy-riding, drunk, and got into

some scrape, why don't you admit it,

instead of accusing innocent people?

MRS. BALDWIN

(beginning to doubt

her senses)

You ruffian! How dare you say a thing

like that?

HILDA

Please, Mother, he's just crazy!

MRS. BALDWIN

(to Sheriff)

I'll tell you something more. I'll

tell you why they did it!

BURNS

(fidgeting)

Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get

bail.

MRS. BALDWIN

(continuing crescendo)

I was in here -- and they had some

kind of murderer in with them. They

were hiding him!

HARTMAN

Hiding him? In here?

MURPHY

Hiding him where?

HILDY

Mother!

REPORTERS

Where was he?... Where'd they have

him?... Etc.

BURNS

(with superb

indignation)

Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And

you know it!

BURNS

(anxiously)

Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get

bail.

HARTMAN

(whispering)

What was that?

REPORTERS AD LIB

He's in the desk! -- For the love of --

He's in there! Etc.

HARTMAN

Aha! I thought so! Stand back,

everybody!

DEPUTY

Look out, Sheriff. He may shoot!

HARTMAN

Get your guns out!

HILDY

He's harmless.

HARTMAN

Don't take any chances. Shoot through

the desk.

HILDY

He can't hurt anybody. You've got

his gun.

MRS. BALDWIN

(panic-stricken)

Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

BURNS

You grey-haired old Judas!

MRS. BALDWIN

Let me out! Let me out of here!

HARTMAN

(to policeman)

You stand there!

MURPHY'S VOICE

City Desk! Quick!

SCHWARTZ' VOICE

Gimme the Desk!

HARTMAN

(to another policeman)

You there!

ENDICOTT'S VOICE

City Desk! Hurry!

MCCUE'S VOICE

Gimme Emil...

HARTMAN

(to a Deputy, pointing

with his gun toward

the window)

You cover the window.

MURPHY'S VOICE

Look out where you're pointing that

gun!

WILSON'S VOICE

Lemme have the Desk! Quick!

MURPHY'S VOICE

Hold the wire! I've got a flash for

you!

BURNS

(to Hildy)

Call Duffy!

HARTMAN

No, you don't!

BURNS

(to Sheriff, furiously)

Do you want to get us scooped?

MCCUE'S VOICE

Emil? Hang on for a second.

HARTMAN

Now then, everybody aim at the center.

And when I say three --

HILDY

That's murder!

HARTMAN

(changing his mind)

All right! Carl! Frank! One of you

get on each side of the desk. Take

hold of the cover.

HARTMAN

Now then! We got you covered,

Williams. Don't try to move. Now!

Everybody quiet and ready for an

emergency. I'm going to count three.

SCHWARTZ

Hold it! Something coming up.

HARTMAN

One!

ENDICOTT

Hold the phone!

MURPHY

(into the phone)

I'll have it in a minute.

HARTMAN

Two!

WILSON

(into phone)

Right away now!

HARTMAN

(turning back to desk)

Everybody ready? All right. Now then,

up with it.

HARTMAN

Got you, Williams!

WILLIAMS

(a wail)

Go on -- shoot me!

MURPHY'S VOICE

Earl Williams was just captured in

the Press Room of the Criminal Courts

Building, hiding in a desk.

OFFICERS AD LIB

(all talking at once)

Grab him! That's him! Don't let him

shoot! Stick 'em up! -- Etc.

MCCUE

(into phone)

...Williams in a rolltop --

WILSON

(into phone)

-- nabbed Williams hiding --

ENDICOTT'S VOICE

-- found Williams' hiding place.

SCHWARTZ' VOICE

He offered no resistance.

MCCUE

(into phone)

Williams put up a desperate struggle

but the police overpowered --

MURPHY

(into phone)

-- tried to shoot it out with the

cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --

WILSON'S VOICE

-- trying to break through the cordon

of police --

ENDICOTT

(into phone)

Williams was unconscious when they

opened the desk --

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy! The Morning Post just turned

Earl Williams over to the Sheriff.

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy!

HARTMAN

(indicating Burns and

Hildy)

Put the cuffs on those two!

ENDICOTT

An anonymous note received by the

Sheriff led to Williams' capture.

More later.

MURPHY

(into phone)

An old sweetheart of Williams'

doublecrossed him. Call you back.

REPORTERS

Where's that old lady? Hey, Madam!

Where'd she go? Where's the old dame?

Etc., etc. They run out after Mrs.

Baldwin, the Mayor entering just

after they go. Burns and Hildy,

handcuffed together, stand near the

Sheriff.

HARTMAN

(into phone)

Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley. Quick!

BURNS

Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd

never been born!

MAYOR

Fine work, Pete! You certainly

delivered the goods. I'm proud of

you.

HARTMAN

(holding the phone)

Look kind o' natural, don't they,

Fred?

MAYOR

(happily)

A sight for sore eyes!

HARTMAN

(rolling in catnip)

Aiding an escaped criminal! And a

little charge of kidnapping I'm

looking into.

(into phone; suddenly)

But that's the jail! There must be

somebody there!

MAYOR

Well! Looks like about ten years

apiece for you birds!

BURNS

Does it? You forget the power that

always watches over the Morning Post.

MAYOR

Your luck's not with you now!

HARTMAN

(into phone)

Cooley?... I caught Williams single-

handed -- we're going to proceed

with the hanging per schedule!

BURNS

(to Mayor)

You're going to be in office for

exactly two days more and then we're

pulling your nose out of the feed

bag.

HARTMAN

(into phone)

Give me the District Attorney's

office.

(to Burns)

I'll tell you what you'll be doing --

making brooms in the State

penitentiary.

(into phone)

Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell.

Come over to my office, will you?

I've just arrested a couple of

important birds and I want to take

their confessions.

BURNS

(into phone)

Duffy! Get Liebowitz!

MAYOR

All the lawyers in the world aren't

going to help you!

BURNS

This is the Morning Post you're

talking to!

MAYOR

(enjoying himself)

The power of the press, huh!

BURNS

(at the Mayor)

Bigger men than you have found out

what the power of the press is...

President!... Yes -- and Kings!

PINKUS

(woozy; handing Sheriff

the reprieve over

his shoulder)

Here's your reprieve.

MAYOR

(in a panic)

Get out of here!

PINKUS

You can't bribe me!

BURNS

What's this?

HARTMAN

Get out of here, you!

PINKUS

I won't. Here's your reprieve.

HILDY

What?

PINKUS

I don't want to be City Sealer. I

don't like seals anyhow. They smell.

MAYOR

Who is this man?

HARTMAN

(to an officer)

Throw him out, Frank.

HILDY

(seizing Pinkus with

her free hand)

Who was bribing you?

PINKUS

They wouldn't take it.

MAYOR

You're insane!

BURNS

(triumphant)

What did I tell you? An unseen power!

(to Pinkus)

What's your name?

PINKUS

Silas F. Pinkus.

MAYOR

You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The

idea of coming here with a cock-and-

bull story like that!

HARTMAN

It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

HILDY

Wait a minute!

(to the officers)

Let go there!

BURNS

(to Sheriff and Mayor)

Murder, uh?

HILDY

Hanging an innocent man to win an

election!

HARTMAN

That's a lie!!

MAYOR

I never saw him before!

BURNS

(to Pinkus)

When did you deliver this first?

HILDY

Who did you talk to?

PINKUS

They started right in bribing me!

HILDY

Who's 'they'?

PINKUS

(indicating the Mayor

and Sheriff)

Them!

MAYOR

That's absurd on the face of it, Mr.

Burns! He's talking like a child.

BURNS

Out of the mouths of babes.

MAYOR

He's insane or drunk or something.

Why, if this unfortunate man,

Williams, has really been reprieved,

I personally am tickled to death.

Aren't you, Pete?

HILDY

Go on, you'd kill your mother to get

elected!

MAYOR

That's a horrible thing to say, Miss

Johnson, about anybody!

(to Burns)

Now, look here, Walter, you're an

intelligent man --

BURNS

(interrupting)

Just a minute.

(to Pinkus)

All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have

your story.

PINKUS

Well, I been married for ten years

and --

BURNS

(interrupting)

Skip all that.

MAYOR

(loudly)

Take those handcuffs off our friends,

Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.

HARTMAN

(springing to obey)

I was just going to!

MAYOR

Walter, I can't tell you how badly I

feel about this. There was no excuse

for Hartwell to fly off the handle.

HARTMAN

(unlocking the

handcuffs)

I was only doing my duty. Nothing

personal in it.

HILDY

You guys better quit politics and

take in washing.

MAYOR

(looking over the

reprieve)

Sheriff, this document is authentic!

Earl Williams has been reprieved,

this Commonwealth has been spared

the painful necessity of shedding

blood.

BURNS

Save that for the Tribune.

MAYOR

(to Pinkus)

What did you say your name was --

Pinkus?

PINKUS

That's right.

PINKUS

Here's the picture of my wife.

MAYOR

A very fine-looking women.

PINKUS

(mysteriously angered)

She's good enough for me! And if I

was to go home and tell my wife --

MAYOR

I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus,

and as long as I am Mayor --

BURNS

Which ought to be about three hours

more, I'd say.

HILDY

Just until we can get out a special

edition asking for your impeachment.

BURNS

And your arrest. You'll each get

about ten years, I think.

MAYOR

Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr.

Burns, you might run into a thumping

big libel suit.

HILDY

You're going to run into the Governor.

MAYOR

(trying to brush it

off)

Now, my old friend the Governor and

I understand each other perfectly.

HARTMAN

(eagerly)

And so do I!

MAYOR

(with superb contempt)

So do you what, you hoodoo!

(to Pinkus, suavely)

And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come

with us, we'll take you over to the

Warden's office and deliver this

reprieve.

BURNS

(dreamily)

Wait till those two future jailbirds

read the Morning Post tomorrow.

HILDY

How was that for a tight squeeze?

BURNS

Don't tell me you were worried!

HILDY

Worried! I was petrified. Weren't

you?

BURNS

Uh-uh. As long as we were in there

together pitching -- they couldn't

lick us. Well, it's been a lot of

fun.

HILDY

In a way.

BURNS

(laughs)

I mean -- working together. Just

like the old days. The things we've

been through, Hildy.

HILDY

We've certainly been in some swell

jams.

BURNS

Remember the time we broke into the

D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi

Randell's diary?

HILDY

Yeah. What about the time we hid the

missing heiress in the sauerkraut

factory? Six scoop interviews!

BURNS

Yeah - but that time we stole Old

Lady Haggerty's stomach off the

Coroner's physician. We proved she

was poisoned though, didn't we?

HILDY

(laughing)

We sure did, but we had to go in

hiding for a week.

BURNS

In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only

chaperon was the poor old lady's

stomach.

HILDY

Don't remind me. That's how we

happened to --

BURNS

Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be

making love to another man's fiancee.

HILDY

That's all right, Walter. It's as

much my fault as yours.

BURNS

(glancing at the clock)

Bruce is making the nine o'clock

train. I told him you'd be on it --

unless you want to write this story

yourself.

HILDY

Well, if it's my last story, I'd

like it to be a good one. But -- I

guess I can't, Walter.

BURNS

Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for

me to decide. Of course, you could

make a later train and still be in

Albany tomorrow morning.

HILDY

Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

BURNS

He's going to have you the rest of

his life, Hildy. Can't you give me

another hour?

HILDY

I don't know what to do, Walter.

BURNS

Flip a coin.

HILDY

All right.

(takes coin from her

bag)

Heads I go -- tails I stay to write

the story. Ready?

BURNS

Ready.

BURNS

(nervously)

Well -- what is it?

HILDY

(almost breaking)

What's the difference? I'm going to

write that story -- and you know it!

BURNS

Hildy!

HILDY

(furiously)

Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for

you!

BURNS

(softly)

Then why are you doing it?

HILDY

Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven

help me!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BURNS

(enthusiastically)

The greatest yarn ever written by

anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!

HILDY

(grimly)

Thanks.

BURNS

And what a way to quit. While you're

still champion! That's the way to

leave, Hildy!

HILDY

Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving,

Walter.

BURNS

What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting

for you in Albany.

HILDY

No, he won't. I wired him that I

wasn't coming.

BURNS

Where'd you wire him?

HILDY

On the nine o'clock train. That's

the one he took, isn't it?

BURNS

Sure.

HILDY

It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs

a wife who can give him a home --

and affection -- and peace. I couldn't

do that for him, Walter. I'm what

you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd

give up her soul for a story!... Is

that job still open?

BURNS

Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper --

and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

HILDY

Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We

tried it.

BURNS

Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful!

Only you expected it to be like other

marriages. It can't be like other

marriages -- we're different! We're

a different world. Look at what we

went through today. I wouldn't trade

that for any honeymoon in the world.

I bet you wouldn't, either.

HILDY

A fine honeymoon, with a murderer

right in the boudoir! And that other

honeymoon in a coal mine!

BURNS

That's what makes it romantic. Every

other married couple goes away on a

honeymoon and for two weeks the bride

knows just where the groom is, and

vice versa. But us -- you never know

where I am and I'm not sure where

you are. That's Romance!

HILDY

Well, maybe I'd like to know just

once!

BURNS

Hildy, if that's what you want, all

right. We'll even go to -- how about

Niagara Falls?

HILDY

(jumping)

Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't

mean that?

BURNS

Sure I do. And I'll tell you something

else -- I'd like a baby.

HILDY

Walter!

BURNS

Sure, I can't last forever. I want a

son I can train to take my place on

this paper.

HILDY

What would you do if it was a

daughter?

BURNS

Well, if she looked like you -- Say!

My brains and your looks -- that

mightn't be such a bad combination.

HILDY

What's the matter with my brains?

BURNS

What's the good of arguing about

something that probably doesn't exist?

Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you.

What do you say?

HILDY

Well, I'd like to be lady-like and

think it over.

BURNS

I don't want to rush you. Take a

couple of seconds.

BURNS

Hello, Judge!

JUDGE

This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending

a gunman to kidnap me!

BURNS

Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't

a kidnapping. You've got the legal

power to perform a marriage ceremony,

haven't you?

HILDY

What!

BURNS

Now don't argue, Hildy.

(to Judge)

How about it, Judge?

JUDGE

Yes, but --

BURNS

Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy.

HILDY

Nobody's going to rush me into

anything!

(as Louie sticks a

gun in her ribs)

You keep away from me!

(but she's scared)

LOUIE

All right, Judge.

1ST REPORTER

I'll be doggoned! A shotgun marriage!

2ND REPORTER

Don't they usually keep the gun on

the man?

JUDGE

(continuing)

" -- so long as you both do live?"

BURNS

I will.

HILDY

That's what he said the last time.

Don't believe him, Judge.

BURNS

Hildy, from this time on no tricks,

no double-crossing -- everything on

the level!

HILDY

You're not fooling anybody.

JUDGE

(continuing)

"Hildegarde Johnson, will you have

this man as your wedded husband, to

live together in the ordinances and

estate of Matrimony?"

HILDY

What would you do with a gun in your

back?

LOUIE

(poking her)

Quiet!

JUDGE

"Will you love him, comfort him,

honor and keep him in sickness or in

health; --

HILDY

If I know where he is.

JUDGE

" -- and, forsaking all others, keep

thee only unto him, so long as you

both do live?"

HILDY

I will -- if he will.

JUDGE

(to Burns)

Have you got a ring?

BURNS

(he takes ring off)

How about Bruce's?

HILDY

Walter, you can't do that!

BURNS

Sure, I can. Look at the policy I

gave him!

(placing Bruce's ring

on Hildy's finger)

"With this ring I thee wed and with

all my worldly goods I thee endow:

And thereto I plight thee my troth."

REPORTER

Say, I'm surprised she got the ring

back!

JUDGE

" -- pronounce you Man and Wife."

BURNS

Hildy, darling!

HILDY

Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a

fool. That's what I am. I know what

it's going to be like.

BURNS

It'll be Heaven!

HILDY

Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought

up another coal mine to send me down

in -- to get a new story for your

paper!

HILDY

Walter!

"COUNTERFEIT PASSER CAUGHT!"

HILDY

Counterfeit money! That's the money

you sent me, Walter! You -- you --

WALTER

(starting to run)

But, Hildy, listen --

BURNS

But, Hildy -- I can explain --

HILDY

You -- you!!

LOUIE

I think it's going to work out all

right this time.

FADE OUT:

THE END
