CHARADE

Peter Stone and Marc Behm

October 1st, 1962

(MAIN TITLES)

JEAN-LOUIS

(in for trouble)

Oh, la.

REGGIE

Don't tell me you didn't know it was

loaded.

(calling)

Sylvie!

REGGIE

Isn't there something constructive

he can do -- like start an avalanche?

SYLVIE

(to JEAN-LOUIS)

Va jouer, mon ange.

SYLVIE

When you start to eat like this

something is the matter.

REGGIE

Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

SYLVIE

Ca alors! From Charles?

REGGIE

He's the only husband I've got. I

tried to make it work, I really have --

but --

SYLVIE

But what?

REGGIE

I don't know how to explain it. I'm

just too miserable.

SYLVIE

It is infuriating that your

unhappiness does not turn to fat!

SYLVIE

But why do you want a divorce?

REGGIE

Because I don't love him.

SYLVIE

But that is no reason to get a

divorce!

SYLVIE

With a rich husband and this year's

clothes you will not find it difficult

to make some new friends.

REGGIE

(sitting)

I admit I moved to Paris because I

was tired of American Provincial,

but that doesn't mean I'm ready for

French Traditional. I loathe the

idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if

only Charles had been honest with me --

that's all I ask of anybody -- the

simple truth. But with him, everything

is secrecy and lies. He's hiding

something -- something frightening --

something terrible -- and evil.

MAN

Does this belong to you?

PETER

Oh, forgive me.

(indicating JEAN-LOUIS)

Is this yours?

REGGIE

(indicating SYLVIE)

It's hers. Where'd you find him,

robbing a bank?

PETER

He was throwing snowballs at Baron

Rothschild.

(a pause)

We don't know each other, do we?

REGGIE

Why, do you think we're going to?

PETER

I don't know -- how would I know?

REGGIE

I'm afraid I already know a great

many people. Until one of them dies

I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

PETER

(smiling)

Yes, of course. But you will let me

know if anyone goes on the critical

list

(he starts off)

REGGIE

Quitter.

PETER

(turning)

How's that?

REGGIE

You give up awfully easy, don't you?

SYLVIE

Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a

walk. I have never seen a Rothschild

before.

PETER

(drying)

Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

REGGIE

I'm afraid you're blocking my view.

PETER

(moving)

Sorry. Which view would you like?

REGGIE

The one you're blocking. This is the

last chance I have -- I'm flying

back to Paris this afternoon. What's

your name?

PETER

Peter Joshua.

REGGIE

I'm Regina Lampert.

PETER

Is there a Mr. Lampert?

REGGIE

Yes.

PETER

Good for you.

REGGIE

No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

PETER

Please, not on my account.

REGGIE

No, you see, I don't really love

him.

PETER

Well, you're honest, anyway.

REGGIE

Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it --

dishonesty infuriates me. Like when

you go into a drugstore.

PETER

I'm not sure I --

REGGIE

Well, you go in and you ask for some

toothpaste -- the small size -- and

the man brings you the large size.

You tell him you wanted the small

size but he says the large size is

the small size. I always thought the

large size was the largest size, but

he says that the family size, the

economy size and the giant size are

all larger than the large size --

that the large size is the smallest

size there is.

PETER

Oh. I guess.

REGGIE

Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

PETER

Yes, but we're divorced.

REGGIE

That wasn't a proposal -- I was just

curious.

PETER

Is your husband with you?

REGGIE

Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me.

First it was separate rooms -- now

we're trying it with cities. What do

people call you -- Pete?

PETER

Mr. Joshua.

(turning to go)

Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

REGGIE

Now you're angry.

PETER

No, I'm not -- I've got some packing

to do. I'm also going back to Paris

today.

REGGIE

Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who

said: "When strangers do meet they

should erelong see one another again"?

PETER

Shakespeare never said that.

REGGIE

How do you know?

PETER

It's terrible -- you just made it

up.

REGGIE

Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are

you going to call me?

PETER

Are you in the book?

REGGIE

Charles is.

PETER

Is there only one Charles Lampert?

REGGIE

Lord, I hope so.

REGGIE

Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.

(She turns toward the

house)

JEAN-LOUIS

When you get your divorce will you

be going back to America?

SYLVIE

He knows everything.

REGGIE

(to JEAN-LOUIS)

Don't you want me to stay?

JEAN-LOUIS

Yes, of course -- but if you went

back and wrote me a letter --

REGGIE

-- you could have the stamps. I'll

get you some here, okay?

JEAN-LOUIS

Okay.

REGGIE

(handing him a tip)

Merci.

REGGIE'S VOICE

Wonderful.

REGGIE

Honorine -- !

REGGIE

Charles -- !

GRANDPIERRE

Madame Charles Lampert?

REGGIE

Yes.

GRANDPIERRE

I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre

of the Police Judiciaire. Would you

be so kind as to come with me, please?

GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Well, Madame -- ?

GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)

You are positive?

GRANDPIERRE

You loved him?

REGGIE

I'm very cold.

GRANDPIERRE

We discovered your husband's body

lying next to the tracks of the Paris-

Bourdeaux railroad line. He was

dressed only in his pajamas. Do you

know of any reason why he might have

wished to leave France?

REGGIE

Leave?

GRANDPIERRE

Your husband possessed a ticket of

passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed

from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this

morning at seven.

REGGIE

(a pause)

I'm very confused.

GRANDPIERRE

He was American?

REGGIE

Swiss.

GRANDPIERRE

Oh. Swiss. His profession?

REGGIE

He didn't have one.

GRANDPIERRE

He was a wealthy man?

REGGIE

I don't know. I suppose so.

GRANDPIERRE

About how wealthy would you say?

REGGIE

I don't know.

GRANDPIERRE

Where did he keep his money?

REGGIE

I don't know.

GRANDPIERRE

Besides yourself, who is his nearest

relation?

REGGIE

I don't know.

GRANDPIERRE

(exploding)

C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment

absurde!

REGGIE

I know.

(pause)

I'm sorry.

GRANDPIERRE

It is all right.

GRANDPIERRE

Is it all right?

REGGIE

I wish you wouldn't.

GRANDPIERRE

Les effets de Lampert.

GRANDPIERRE

On Wednesday last your husband sold

the entire contents of the apartment

at public auction. Furniture,

clothing, kitchenware -- everything.

The gallery, in complying with his

wishes, paid him in cash. One million

two hundred and fifty thousand New

Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a

million. The authorities in Bordeaux

have searched his compartment on the

train. They have searched it

thoroughly. They did not find

$250,000, Madame.

GRANDPIERRE

These few things are all that was

found in the train compartment. There

was no other baggage. Your husband

must have been in a great hurry.

GRANDPIERRE

One wallet containing four thousand

francs -- one agenda --

(pausing, he opens

the notebook)

-- his last notation was made

yesterday -- Thursday --

(reading)

"Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-

Elysees"

(looking up)

Why there?

REGGIE

I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.

GRANDPIERRE

(dryly)

Obviously.

(returning to the

items in the basket)

One ticket of passage to South America --

one letter, stamped but unsealed,

addressed to you --

REGGIE

(lighting up)

A letter? May I see it?

REGGIE

(reading)

"My dear Regina: I hope you are

enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be

so lovely this time of year. The

days pass very slowly and I hope to

see you soon. As always, Charles.

P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.

Your appointment has been changed."

(she looks up, puzzled)

Not very much, is it?

GRANDPIERRE

We took the liberty of calling your

dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we

would learn something.

REGGIE

Did you?

GRANDPIERRE

Yes. Your appointment has been

changed.

(he smiles at his

little joke, then

returns to the basket)

One key to your apartment -- one

comb -- one fountain pen --  one

toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder

(he looks up)

-- that is all.

GRANDPIERRE

If you will sign this list you may

take the things with you.

REGGIE

(sighing)

Is that all? Can I go now?

GRANDPIERRE

One more question. Is this your

husband's passport?

REGGIE

Of course it is.

GRANDPIERRE

And this?

REGGIE

I don't understand.

GRANDPIERRE

And this? And this?

GRANDPIERRE

Have you nothing to say, Madame?

REGGIE

(hopefully)

It's all right if you want to smoke

your cigar now.

REGGIE

(surprised)

What are you doing here?

PETER

I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted

to tell you how sorry I am -- and to

find out if there was anything I

could do.

REGGIE

How did you find out?

PETER

It's in all the afternoon papers.

I'm very sorry.

REGGIE

Thank you.

PETER

I rang the bell but I don't think

it's working.

REGGIE

Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.

REGGIE

They must have turned off the

electricity.

PETER

Where did everything go?

REGGIE

Charles sold it all -- at auction.

PETER

Do you know what you're going to do?

REGGIE

Try and get my old job back at UNESCO,

I suppose.

PETER

Doing what?

REGGIE

I'm a simultaneous translator --

like Sylvie, only she's English to

French -- I'm French to English.

That's what I did before I married

Charles. The police probably think I

killed him.

PETER

Instant divorce you mean?

REGGIE

Something like that. But I'm sorry

it ended like this -- tossed off a

train like a sack of third-class

mail.

PETER

(Taking her hand)

Come on. You can't stay here.

REGGIE

I don't know where to go.

PETER

We'll find you a hotel.

REGGIE

Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady

of leisure anymore.

PETER

Something modest but clean -- and

near enough to UNESCO so you can

take a cab when it rains -- okay?

REGGIE

I loved this room -- but Charles

never saw it -- only what was in it.

All those exquisite things --

(looking around)

I think I prefer it like this.

REGGIE

It's not exactly what I'd call a

large turn-out.

SYLVIE

Didn't Charles have any friends?

REGGIE

Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.

(indicating GRANDPIERRE)

If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't

even have him.

SYLVIE

At least he knows how to behave at

funerals.

SYLVIE

Have you no idea who could have done

it?

REGGIE

Until two days ago all I really knew

about Charles was his name -- now it

turns out I didn't even know that.

SYLVIE

Do you know him?

REGGIE

I've never seen him before.

SYLVIE

He must have known Charles pretty

well.

REGGIE

How can you tell?

SYLVIE

He's allergic to him.

TEX

(heavy Texas accent)

Ariva durchy, Charlie.

TEX

Miz Lampert, ma'am...

TEX

Miz Lampert, ma'am...

REGGIE

Yes?

TEX

Charlie had no call to handling it

this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

REGGIE

I don't understa--

REGGIE

Merci, Monsieur.

ATTENDANT

Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon --

pardon.

SYLVIE

Who is it from?

REGGIE

The American Embassy.

SYLVIE

What is it about?

REGGIE

I don't know.  But if this is a sample

of American diplomacy I'm buying a

fallout shelter.

1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE

I bluffed the Old Man out of the

last pot -- with a pair of deuces.

2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE

What's so depressing about that?

1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE

If I can do it, what are the Russians

doing to him?

REGGIE

(tentatively)

Hello -- ?

(there is no answer)

Hello?

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

(from the private

office)

Is there anything wrong, Miss

Tompkins?

REGGIE

Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.

BARTHOLOMEW

I'm sorry -- my secretary must have

gone to lunch. You are -- ?

REGGIE

Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

BARTHOLOMEW

(looking at his watch)

Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite

late.

BARTHOLOMEW

Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert --

it's a stubborn little devil.

BARTHOLOMEW

Dry-cleaningwise, things are all

fouled up. I had a good man -- an

excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu,

but H.Q. asked us to use the plant

here in the building -- to ease the

gold outflow.

REGGIE

Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you

know who I am?

BARTHOLOMEW

(looking up)

Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?

(going back to the

tie)

Last time I sent out a tie only the

spot came back.

BARTHOLOMEW

Voila! As they say.

BARTHOLOMEW

Have some, please. I've got...

(checking)

...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken

and -- liverwurst.

REGGIE

No thanks.

BARTHOLOMEW

Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs.

Lampert?

REGGIE

I don't suppose it's an airline, is

it?

BARTHOLOMEW

Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

REGGIE

You mean spies and things like that?

BARTHOLOMEW

Only we call them agents.

REGGIE

We? You mean you're --?

BARTHOLOMEW

Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --

REGGIE

I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't

think that you people were supposed

to admit --

BARTHOLOMEW

I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert --

I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey --

trying to run a bureau of overworked

men with under-allocated funds.

Congress seems to think that all a

spy needs --

REGGIE

Agent.

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes -- That all he needs is a code

book and a cyanide pill and he's in

business.

REGGIE

What's all this got to do with me,

Mr. Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW

(his mouth full)

Your husband was wanted by the U. S.

government.

REGGIE

May I have a sandwich, please?

BARTHOLOMEW

To be more specific, he was wanted

by this agency.

REGGIE

(eating)

So that was it.

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes. We knew him, of course, by his

real name.

REGGIE

(almost choking)

His -- real -- ?

BARTHOLOMEW

Voss -- Charles Voss. All right,

Mrs. Voss --

(taking a photo from

his desk)

-- I'd like you to look at this

photograph, please -- by the way,

you saw this one, didn't you?

(indicating the kids

on the desk)

Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.

REGGIE

Very sweet.

BARTHOLOMEW

Aren't they?  Now look at this one,

Mrs. Voss, and --

REGGIE

Stop calling me that! Lampert's the

name on the marriage license.

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes -- and tell me if you recognize

anyone. Just a moment. Have a good

look.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

It's Charles!

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

Very good.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

He looks so young -- when was this

taken?

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

1944. The next face, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

It's the man who came to the funeral

yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a

tall man in a corduroy suit and string

tie.

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

Does the name Tex Penthollow mean

anything to you?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

No.

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

Next, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yes -- and he was there, too -- a

little fatter now -- and less hair --

but it's the same one.

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs.

Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

No.

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

The last one, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

That's a face you don't forget -- he

was there too --

BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)

Herman Scobie. And you've never seen

him before, either?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

No, thank heaven.

BARTHOLOMEW

(a pause, regarding

her)

Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a

great deal of danger.

REGGIE

Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

BARTHOLOMEW

You're Charles Voss's wife -- now

that he's dead you're their only

lead.

REGGIE

Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying

to frighten me you're doing a really

first-rate job!

(she takes another

sandwich)

BARTHOLOMEW

Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert --

it's your only chance.

REGGIE

Gladly, only I don't know what you

want! You haven't told me.

BARTHOLOMEW

Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs.

Lampert -- the money. The $250,000

Charles Voss received from the

auction. Those three men want it,

too -- they want it very badly.

REGGIE

But it's Charles's money, not theirs.

BARTHOLOMEW

(laughing)

Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see

you try and convince them of that!

(drying his eyes)

Oh, dear.

REGGIE

Then whose is it? His or theirs?

BARTHOLOMEW

Ours.

REGGIE

(she looks at him for

a moment)

Oh, I see.

BARTHOLOMEW

And I'm afraid we want it back.

REGGIE

But I don't have it.

BARTHOLOMEW

That's impossible. You're the only

one who could have it.

REGGIE

I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the

truth.

BARTHOLOMEW

I believe you.

REGGIE

Thanks very much.

BARTHOLOMEW

Oh, you've got the money all right --

you just don't know you've got it.

REGGIE

Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter

of a million dollars, believe me,

I'd know it.

BARTHOLOMEW

Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've

got it.

REGGIE

You mean it's just lying around

someplace -- all that cash?

BARTHOLOMEW

Or a safe deposit key, a certified

check, a baggage claim -- you look

for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite

sure you'll find it.

REGGIE

But --

BARTHOLOMEW

Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look

just as hard and as fast as you can.

You may not have a great deal of

time. Those men know you have it

just as surely as we do. You won't

be safe until the money's in our

hands. Is that clear?

BARTHOLOMEW

Here's where you're to call me --

day or night. It's a direct line to

both my office and my apartment.

Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and

please don't tell anyone about coming

to see me. It could prove fatal for

them as well as yourself.

REGGIE

Wait a minute -- you think those

three men killed Charles, don't you?

BARTHOLOMEW

We've no proof, of course, but we

rather think so, yes.

REGGIE

Well, there you are! Charles had the

money with him -- so whoever killed

him has it -- they have it!

REGGIE

Why not?

BARTHOLOMEW

(grimly)

Because they're still here.

REGGIE

Oh.

BARTHOLOMEW

Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid

you're in a great deal of danger.

Remember what happened to Charles.

PETER

Reggie -- ?

REGGIE

(vaguely)

Hallo, Peter.

PETER

You telephoned me to meet you. I've

been standing on the corner back

there -- waiting for you.

REGGIE

I'm sorry -- I heard the children

laughing.

PETER

What's going on?

REGGIE

Don't you understand French?

PETER

I'm still having trouble with English.

REGGIE

The man and the woman are married --

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yes, I can see that -- they're batting

each other over the head with clubs.

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

Who's that with the hat?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

That's the policeman -- he wants to

arrest Judy for killing Punch.

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

What's she saying now?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

That she's innocent -- she didn't do

it.

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

She did it, all right -- take it

from me.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

I believe her.

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

Who was that?

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Punch, of course.

PETER

Of course? I thought he was dead.

REGGIE

He's only pretending, to teach her a

lesson -- only --

(her face clouding)

only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him --

he's not pretending. Somebody threw

him off a train. What am I going to

do?

PETER

I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever

it is, it doesn't sound like the

sort of thing that a woman can handle

all by herself.

PETER

Have you got a mirror?

(she nods)

Give it to me.

PETER

Right there, between your eyes --

see? Worry lines. You're much too

young and too pretty to have anything

like that. How about making me vice-

president in charge of cheering you

up?

REGGIE

(jumping at the

suggesting)

Starting tonight?

EMCEE

Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good

evening ladies and gentlemen, guten

Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce

soir, comme tous les soirs,

l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep

Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et

messieurs, step right up, ladies and

gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine

Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e

signori -- avanti!

PETER

What was all that?

REGGIE

Fun and games. Evidently we're the

floorshow.

PETER

You mean you and me?

REGGIE

No, everyone. Come on -- avanti,

avanti!

EMCEE

Ecoutez bien -- les regles sont tres

simples -- the rules are very easy --

deux equipes -- two teams -- each

with one orange -- une orange --

eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia --

held under the chin, like so --

(does it)

comme ca -- and passed to the player

behind you -- sans vous servir de

vos mains -- using nothing but the

chin -- no hands -- and keeping the

orange at all costs from touching

the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et

Messieurs -- begin, ladies and

gentlemen -- signore e signori,

comminciate!

PETER

En garde.

REGGIE

Lay on, MacDuff.

GIDEON

Mrs. Lampert --

REGGIE

What do you want?

GIDEON

Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

REGGIE

Tell me what?

GIDEON

It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert --

you do know that, don't you?

REGGIE

I don't know anything.

GIDEON

Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you

could wake up dead.

REGGIE

Leave me alone -- !

GIDEON

Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's

news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --

REGGIE (SHOUTING)

Stop it!

PETER

Reggie -- what's the trouble?

REGGIE

He -- he was stepping on my foot.

GIDEON

Forgive me -- it was quite

unintentional, I'm sure.

REGGIE

(starting off)

Wait for me -- I won't be long.

REGGIE

(into 'phone)

Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie

Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew:

I've seen one of the

(she stops)

Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?

REGGIE

Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me,

Regina Lam...

TEX

Howdy, Miz Lampert.

REGGIE

Wha -- what do you want?

TEX

You know what I want, Miz Lampert...

REGGIE

No -- no, I'm don't.

TEX

Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd

better give it to me, Miz Lampert --

cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!

REGGIE

I don't know what --

REGGIE

What are you doing?

REGGIE

Stop that!

TEX

Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

TEX

It could get a whole lot worse.

TEX

It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an'

if you don't give it to me your life

ain't gonna be worth the paper it's

printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin',

Miz Lampert?

REGGIE

Please stop -- please!

TEX

You think on it real careful-like,

Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

REGGIE

You're insane, absolutely insane!

PETER

What are you doing in here?

REGGIE

(a sigh of relief)

Having a nervous breakdown.

PETER

You haven't said a word since we

left the club -- what happened back

there?

REGGIE

I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to

tell you or not.

PETER

I don't think I follow you.

REGGIE

He said if I told anybody it could

prove fatal for them as well as me.

PETER

Who said?

REGGIE

That's what I'm not supposed to say.

PETER

Stop this nonsense! If you're in

some sort of trouble I want to know

about it.

REGGIE

Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying

me.

PETER

I wasn't --

REGGIE

Yes, you were -- you called it

nonsense. Being murdered in cold

blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it

happens to you sometime.

NIGHT CLERK

Bonsoir.

REGGIE

Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous

plait.

NIGHT CLERK

Bonne nuit.

REGGIE

(to PETER)

Would you mind seeing me to the door?

PETER

Of course not.

REGGIE

This is quite a place for making

friends, isn't it?

PETER

You said this afternoon that your

husband was mixed up in something.

REGGIE

(busy examining the

cleft in his chin)

How do you shave in there?

PETER

What was it?

REGGIE

What was what?

PETER

What your husband was mixed up in.

REGGIE

Look, I know it's asking you to

stretch your imagination, but can't

you pretend for a moment that I'm a

woman and that you're a --

PETER

Don't you know I could already be

arrested for transporting a minor

above the first floor?

PETER

We're here.

REGGIE

Where?

PETER

On the street where you live.

REGGIE

How about once more around the park?

PETER

Out.

REGGIE

(imitating PETER)

Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a

nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it

is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one,

all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll

behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby,

I never make promises I can't keep.'

PETER

How would you like a spanking?

REGGIE

How would you like a punch in the

nose? Stop treating me like a child.

PETER

Then stop acting like one. If you're

really in some kind of trouble, I'd

like to hear about it. Otherwise,

it's late, I'm tired and I'm going

home to bed.

REGGIE

Do you know what's wrong with you?

PETER

What?

REGGIE

Nothing. Good night.

PETER

Good night.

SCOBIE

Where is it, lady -- where've you

got it?

REGGIE

(terrified)

I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --

SCOBIE

I want it -- give it to me -- it's

mine!

REGGIE

(screaming)

Peter -- ! Peter -- !

REGGIE

A man -- he tried to kill me!

REGGIE

(entering cautiously)

Peter -- ?

(alarmed)

Peter! Where are you?

REGGIE

Peter -- are you all right?

PETER

I think I sprained my pride.

(He looks around)

Where'd he go?

REGGIE

Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't

see him.

PETER

Lock the door and the window -- and

don't let anyone in except me. I'll

be back in a minute.

REGGIE

Be careful, Peter.

PETER

(one leg over the

sill)

You took the words right out of my

mouth.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Oh!

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

What is it now, Pamela?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

It happened again, Henry -- another

strange man peered in the window at

me and then went away.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Bad luck, Pamela.

GIDEON

That was a dumb move, Herman -- a

dumb move.

TEX

And then some. If you'd only told us

you was goin' to her room we could've

kept 'em busy --

TEX

-- but sneakin' in there on your own

that-a-way, why, man, you was bound

to get yore tokus kicked. I mean,

what'd you think he'd do -- walk up

'n' shake you by that hand o' yores?

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

That's right, Herman -- you didn't

leave me much choice.

PETER

(to SCOBIE)

I didn't hurt you, did I?

GIDEON

(eagerly)

Never mind that -- did you get the

money?

PETER

How could I with the three Marx

Brothers breathing down my neck? You

said you'd let me handle it alone --

! The girl trusts me. If she's got

it, I'll find out about it. But you've

got to leave me alone.

SCOBIE

(to GIDEON and TEX)

We took all the chances. The money

belongs to us, not him!

TEX

Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman --

don't forget he done us a little ol'

favor.

SCOBIE

Yeah? What's that?

TEX

He took care of Charlie for us.

GIDEON

(to PETER)

We appreciate it, really we do.

SCOBIE

But who asked him? Three shares are

enough -- I'd say he's out!

PETER

A third of nothing is nothing, Herman.

Make up your minds -- she's waiting

for me.

GIDEON

(thoughtfully)

I don't see how another twenty-four

hours could hurt.

TEX

Shoot no, not after all these years.

SCOBIE

Then he gets it out of your share,

not mine! Not mine!

GIDEON

I suggest you get about your business --

nothing soothes Herman like success.

TEX

(chuckling)

That's right -- it's like ticklin' a

alligator's belly.

PETER

Who's got the room next to hers?

TEX

Me. How come?

PETER

Get another one, will you? I'm going

to need it.

TEX

If you do find the money -- you won't

forget t' tell us about it, will

you, fella?

PETER

(turning at the door)

Don't worry.

TEX

Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this

pudgy little fella here?

(indicating GIDEON)

He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n

I am.

REGGIE

Who is it?

PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)

It's me. Peter.

PETER

There was no trace of him. All right,

Reggie -- suppose you tell me what

this is all about.

REGGIE

There are three men -- he's one of

them -- they think I have something

that belongs to them.

PETER

What?

REGGIE

A quarter of a million dollars.

PETER

Go on.

REGGIE

That's all.

PETER

No, it isn't -- where's the money?

REGGIE

I don't know.  Those men killed

Charles to get it. But he must not

have had it with him on the train.

PETER

So they think he left it with you.

REGGIE

But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --

(tears welling)

And if I don't find it --

(wailing)

Those men going to kill me.

PETER

No, they won't -- I won't let them.

REGGIE

(sobbing)

Please help me, Peter -- you're the

only one I can trust.

PETER

Of course I'll help -- I told you I

would, didn't I? Come on now --

REGGIE

I'm so hungry I could faint.

(trying to smile)

I've -- I've gotten your suit all

wet.

PETER

That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.

REGGIE

Peter, you've got to promise me

something. Promise you'll never lie

the way Charles did. Why do people

have to tell lies?

PETER

Usually it's because they want

something -- and they're afraid the

truth won't get it for them.

REGGIE

Do you tell lies?

REGGIE

(into the phone)

Hello?

SCOBIE

Mrs. Lampert? -- it's me -- the man

who was in your room a few minutes

ago --

REGGIE

(on the phone)

What do you want?

PETER

(whispering)

Who is it?

REGGIE

(covering the receiver)

The man you had the fight with.

SCOBIE

(on the phone)

Is Dyle with you?

REGGIE

Who?

SCOBIE

(on the phone)

The man who hit me, lady -- Dyle --

that's his name. What's wrong -- is

he still there?

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Yes -- that's right.

PETER

What is it, Reggie -- what's he

saying?

SCOBIE

(on the phone)

Don't trust him -- don't tell him

anything. He's after the money.

PETER

What'd he say?

REGGIE

He -- he said if I didn't give the

money, he'll kill me.

PETER

I wouldn't take that too seriously.

REGGIE

I believe what he said.

PETER

They're only trying to scare you,

that's all.

REGGIE

How do you know what they're doing?

PETER

I don't -- but as long as they think

you have the money, or know where it

is, or have it without knowing where

it is, or don't even know you have

it --

REGGIE

What are you talking about?

PETER

You mustn't let what he said bother

you. It was only words.

REGGIE

(softly)

Words can hurt very much.

PETER

(a pause)

Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the

morning.

REGGIE

Don't put yourself out.

PETER

Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember

that.

REGGIE

Yes, I'll remember. Good night.

PETER

Good night.

PETER

But if you'll take my advice --

(smiling)

You'll undress in the closet. Oh,

and if you need me, just bang on the

wall. I'll be next door.

REGGIE

(excited)

-- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew --

what I called to tell you was there's

someone else -- someone who wasn't

in that photograph you showed me. He

says his name is Peter Joshua -- but

it isn't -- it's Dyle.

(a pause)

Mr. Bartholomew? -- are you still

there?

BARTHOLOMEW

I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is,

but it's just possible we were wrong

about who killed your husband.

REGGIE

(on the phone)

You mean he might have -- Mr.

Bartholomew, I'm catching the next

plane out of here -- I'm not going

to sit here and wait for someone to

make chopped liver out of me!

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

Where are you now -- can you meet

me? Do you know Les Halles?

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Yes, where?

(a pause)

-- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

DYLE

Reggie -- !

DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Reggie... !

REGGIE

Taxi -- !

REGGIE

N'importe ou -- vite! Allez-y!

DYLE

Taxi -- ! Taxi -- !

DYLE

(pointing)

Follow that taxi.

DRIVER

Comment?

DYLE

Taxi! Follow!

DRIVER

Je ne comprends rien.

DYLE

(finding the word)

Suivre -- el taxi!

DRIVER

Ah! Oui, Monsieur.

REGGIE

(to DRIVER)

Aux Halles -- vite!

BARTHOLOMEW

(looking around)

Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it

'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of

Paris, the belly.

REGGIE

(peeling it)

What did you want to see me about,

Mr. Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW

(leaves a coin on the

crate)

Were you followed?

REGGIE

Yes, but I lost him. I really did it

quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to

think women make the best spies.

BARTHOLOMEW

Agents.

REGGIE

He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I

saw it.

BARTHOLOMEW

Who?

REGGIE

Dyle, or whatever his name is.

BARTHOLOMEW

What does your Mr. Dyle look like,

Mrs. Lampert?

REGGIE

He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

BARTHOLOMEW

Describe him.

REGGIE

Well -- he's tall -- over six feet --

rather thin -- in good physical shape,

I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite

handsome, really.

BARTHOLOMEW

(shaking his head)

No.

REGGIE

No, what?

BARTHOLOMEW

That's not Carson Dyle.

REGGIE

(stopping)

Carson?

BARTHOLOMEW

There's only one Dyle connected with

this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's

Carson.

REGGIE

You mean you've known about him all

along? Why didn't you tell me?

BARTHOLOMEW

It's enough to make you a vegetarian,

isn't it?

REGGIE

It's just lucky that I'm not hanging

next to one of those things right

now.

REGGIE

Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you

tell me you knew about Dyle?

BARTHOLOMEW

I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

REGGIE

Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd

better tell me what this thing's all

about.

BARTHOLOMEW

I suppose you're old enough to have

heard of World War Two?

REGGIE

Barely, yes.

BARTHOLOMEW

In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. --

the military espionage unit -- were

ordered behind the German lines for

the purpose of delivering $250,000

in gold to the French Underground.

The five men --

WAITER

Vous desirez?

REGGIE

(smiling)

They always do that.

BARTHOLOMEW

(to the WAITER)

Cafe.

REGGIE

Gratinee, choucroute garnie, salade

de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.

BARTHOLOMEW

Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned

on spending the entire night here.

REGGIE

Can I at least keep the onion soup?

REGGIE

(to the WAITER)

La soupe tout simplement.

REGGIE

(anxiously)

Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 --

the French Underground --

BARTHOLOMEW

Yes. The five men. They were, of

course, your husband, Charles, the

three men who showed up at his funeral

yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But

something went wrong and they were

unable to locate their contact. It

must have been at that point that

they decided to steal the money.

REGGIE

Steal it how?

BARTHOLOMEW

By burying it, and then reporting

that the Germans had captured it.

All they had to do was come back

after the war, dig it up and split

it five ways -- a quarter of a million

dollars with no questions asked.

REGGIE

(fascinated)

May I have a cigarette, please?

REGGIE

I hate these things -- it's like

drinking coffee through a veil.

BARTHOLOMEW

Everything went smoothly enough until

after the gold was buried -- then,

before they could get out, they were

ambushed by a German patrol. A machine

gun separated Scobie from his right

hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full

in the stomach.

BARTHOLOMEW

What's wrong with that one?

REGGIE

Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened

then?

BARTHOLOMEW

Have you any idea what these things

cost over here?

REGGIE

Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew --

what happened then?

BARTHOLOMEW

Scobie was able to travel, but Carson

Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

WAITER

La soupe, c'est pour qui?

REGGIE

Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

BARTHOLOMEW

Carson was dying so they were forced

to leave him. They finally got back

to the base, made their report, and

waited for the war to end. Only

Charles couldn't wait quite as long

as the others. He beat them back to

the gold, took everything for himself

and disappeared. It's taken Gideon,

Tex and Scobie all this time to catch

up with him again.

REGGIE

But if they stole all that money --

why can't you arrest them?

BARTHOLOMEW

We know what happened from the bits

and pieces we were able to paste

together -- but we still have no

proof.

REGGIE

But what has all this got to do with

the C.I.O.?

BARTHOLOMEW

C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an

extension of the wartime O.S.S. It

was our money and we want it back.

REGGIE

I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but

nothing you've told me has changed

my mind. I still intend leaving Paris --

tonight.

BARTHOLOMEW

I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

You'd better consider what happened

to your husband when he tried to

leave. Those men won't be very far

away -- no matter where you go. In

fact, I don't even see any point in

your changing hotels. Please help

us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is

counting on you.

REGGIE

Well, if I'm going to die, I might

as well do it for my country.

BARTHOLOMEW

That's the spirit.

REGGIE

Oh, stop it. What do you want me to

do?

BARTHOLOMEW

We're anxious to know who this man

is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

REGGIE

Maybe he really is Dyle. He could

still be alive.

BARTHOLOMEW

No, Mrs. Lampert.

REGGIE

But no one actually saw him die.

BARTHOLOMEW

No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is

registered with the War Department

in Washington.

REGGIE

Oh. Then who's this one?

BARTHOLOMEW

I don't know -- but I think you'd

better find out, don't you?

REGGIE

Me? Why me?

BARTHOLOMEW

You're in an ideal position -- he

trusts you.

(grinning)

Besides, you said yourself, women

make the best spies.

REGGIE

(resigned)

Agents.

TOURIST

(calling)

Fraulein --

TOURIST

Fraulein --

REGGIE

(turning but continuing)

What are you doing, following me?

Stop it -- we're going to look like

a parade.

REGGIE

(smiling and rattling

on)

How are you? When did you arrive in

town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's

lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful

things to see and do, it makes one's

head spin to think of it.

TOURIST

(smiling)

Fraulein --

REGGIE

If you don't stop following me I'll

call the police.

REGGIE

Taxi -- !

"A - D."

DYLE

Dyle, please... D - Y - L - E.

CLERK

Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

CLERK

I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle -- nothing today.

DYLE

Thanks -- see you soon.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mr. Dyle, please -- you're wanted on

the telephone -- Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4, please.

DYLE

(picking up the phone)

Yes?

REGGIE

Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

DYLE

Reggie?

REGGIE

It's the only name I've got. How

about you?

DYLE

No cat and mouse -- you've got me.

What do you want to know?

REGGIE

Why you lied to me.

DYLE

I had to -- for all I knew you could

have been in on the whole thing.

REGGIE

Well, you know now, so please tell

me who you are.

DYLE

But you know my name -- it's Dyle.

REGGIE

Carson Dyle is dead.

DYLE

Yes, he is. He was my brother.

REGGIE

Your --

DYLE

The army thinks he was killed in

action by the Germans, but I think

they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie --

and your husband -- because he

wouldn't go along with their scheme

to steal the gold. I think he

threatened to turn them in and they

killed him. I'm trying to prove it.

They think I'm working with them.

But I'm not, and that's the truth.

I'm on your side, Reggie -- please

believe that.

REGGIE

How can I? You lied to me -- the way

Charles did -- and after promising

you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe

you, Peter... oh, but I can't call

you that anymore, can I? It will

take me a while to get used to your

new name -- which I don't even know

yet. What is it?

(pause)

Aren't you going to tell me?

(pause)

Hello -- ?

SCOBIE

(quietly)

If you do anything funny, or try to

talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle --

here and now. Okay?

DYLE

You'll wreck your raincoat.

SCOBIE

Next car, please.

SCOBIE

Okay -- turn around.

SCOBIE

Sit down.

DYLE

What now?

SCOBIE

We wait -- with our mouths shut.

DYLE

How long do you intend -- ?

SCOBIE

I said with the mouth shut.

DYLE

Sorry about that.

SCOBIE

Okay -- up there.

DYLE

Do I knock or something?

SCOBIE

Open it.

SCOBIE

Keep going.

DYLE

The view had better be worth it.

DYLE

Very pretty. Now what?

SCOBIE

I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which

is more than you'd give me. Where's

the money?

DYLE

Is that why you dragged me all the

way up here -- to ask me that? She

has it -- you know that.

SCOBIE

And I say maybe you both have it!

One more time, Dyle -- where is it?

DYLE

Supposing I did have it -- which I

don't -- do you really think I'd

hand it over?

SCOBIE

You're out, Dyle -- right now!

SCOBIE

Step back.

DYLE

Back where?

SCOBIE

That's the idea.

DYLE

Herman?

SCOBIE

Yeah?

DYLE

How are you doing?

SCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

How do you think?

DYLE

If you get bored, try writing 'Love

thy neighbor' a hundred times on the

side of the building.

DYLE

I didn't do it.

MANAGER

The next time madame forgets her

key, there is another one at the

desk.

REGGIE

Is that you?

REGGIE

Didn't anyone ever tell you it's

impolite to --

(seeing his injured

back)

What happened?

DYLE

I met a man with sharp nails.

REGGIE

Scobie?

DYLE

I left him hanging around the American

Express.

REGGIE

Come on -- I've got something that

stings like crazy.

REGGIE

Take off your shirt and lie down.

DYLE

(wincing)

Listen -- all I really want is an

estimate.

REGGIE

It's not so bad. You may not be able

to lie on your back for a few days --

but, then, you can lie from any

position, can't you?

REGGIE

Does it hurt?

DYLE

Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

REGGIE

Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

DYLE

Would you like to see my passport?

REGGIE

Your passport! What kind of a proof

is that?

DYLE

Would you like to see where I was

tattooed?

REGGIE

Sure.

DYLE

Okay, I'll drive you around there

some day.

(his back stinging)

Ouch!

REGGIE

Ha ha. You could at least tell me

what your first name is these days.

DYLE

Alexander.

REGGIE

Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

DYLE

Yes, but we're divorced.

REGGIE

I thought that was Peter Joshua.

DYLE

(smiling)

I'm no easier to live with than he

was.

REGGIE

(finishing the bandage)

There -- you're a new man.

DYLE

I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the

truth, but I had to find out your

part in all this.

REGGIE

Alex -- how can you tell if someone

is lying or not?

DYLE

You can't.

REGGIE

There must be some way.

DYLE

There's an old riddle about two tribes

of Indians -- the Whitefeet always

tell the truth and the Blackfeet

always lie. So one day you meet an

Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful

Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He

tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot,

but which one is he?

REGGIE

Why couldn't you just look at his

feet?

DYLE

Because he's wearing moccasins.

REGGIE

Oh. Well, then he's a truthful

Whitefoot, of course.

DYLE

Why not a lying Blackfoot?

REGGIE

(confused)

Which one are you?

DYLE

(entering, smiling)

Whitefoot, of course.

REGGIE

Come here.

REGGIE

Sit down.

REGGIE

I hope it turns out you're a

Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very

happy hanging around the tepee.

DYLE

Reggie -- listen to me --

REGGIE

Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly

talk. You forget I'm already a widow.

DYLE

So was Juliet -- at fifteen.

REGGIE

I'm not fifteen.

DYLE

Well, there's your trouble right

there -- you're too old for me.

REGGIE

Why can't you be serious?

DYLE

There, you said it.

REGGIE

Said what?

DYLE

Serious. When a man gets to be my

age that's the last word he ever

wants to hear. I don't want to be

serious -- and I especially don't

want you to be.

REGGIE

Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll

just sit around all day long being

frivolous -- how about that?

DYLE

Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

REGGIE

(pulling back)

Okay.

DYLE

What are you doing?

REGGIE

Cutting it out.

DYLE

Who told you to do that?

REGGIE

You did.

DYLE

But I'm not through complaining yet.

REGGIE

Oh.

(She starts kissing

him again)

DYLE

Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

REGGIE

I think I love you, Alex --

DYLE

(mumbling)

The phone's ringing --

REGGIE

Whoever it is won't give up -- and

neither will I.

REGGIE

(on phone)

Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling

on something.

TEX

Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd

oblige it mighty highly if you could

mosey on across the hall 'n chew the

fat with us for a spell.

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Can you give me one good reason why

I should?

TEX

(on the phone)

Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout

seven or eight years old. Th' little

tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie --

ain't that cute?

REGGIE

They've got Jean-Louis!

DYLE

That sounds like their problem.

REGGIE

(into the phone)

I'll be right there.

TEX

(on the phone)

We'll be waitin' in room forty-seven,

Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on

over.

REGGIE

What day is it?

DYLE

Tuesday.

REGGIE

Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie

works late Tuesday nights -- she

always leaves him with me. They

wouldn't do anything to a little

boy, would they?

DYLE

I don't know -- it depends on whether

or not they've already eaten.

SCOBIE

Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other

knee or something, will you? My leg's

going to sleep.

TEX

Upsy-daisy.

JEAN-LOUIS

Are you a real cowboy?

TEX

Sure am.

JEAN-LOUIS

Then where is your gun?

TEX

(taking out his gun)

Right here -- see?

GIDEON

Will you put that thing away!

REGGIE

Jean-Louis!

TEX

Howdy, Miz Lampert.

SCOBIE

(glaring at DYLE)

Who invited you?

DYLE

Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing,

I see.

REGGIE

I'd better call Sylvie -- she must

be frantic.

GIDEON

I'm afraid that will have to wait,

Mrs. Lampert.

REGGIE

But his mother --

GIDEON

She isn't going to be anybody's mother

unless you answer some questions.

TEX

This ain't no game,

Miz Lampert.

SCOBIE

We want that money -- now!

DYLE

(forcefully)

Be quiet, all of you!

DYLE

And stop threatening that boy. He

doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert

doesn't either.

SCOBIE

Then who does?

DYLE

I don't know, Herman -- maybe you

do.

SCOBIE

Me?

DYLE

(to TEX)

Or you --

(to GIDEON)

Or you --

GIDEON, TEX & SCOBIE

(together)

That's the most ridiculous -- !

You gone loco?

Listen to the man!

DYLE

Slowly. Suppose one of you found

Charles here in Paris, followed him,

cornered him on the train, threw him

out the window and took the money.

SCOBIE

(after a pause)

That's a crock! If one of us did

that he wouldn't hang around here

waiting for the other two to wise

up.

DYLE

But he'd have to. If he left he'd be

admitting his guilt -- and the others

would know what happened. Whoever it

is has to wait here, pretending to

look for the money, waiting for the

rest of us to give up and go home.

That's when he'll be safe and not a

minute before.

GIDEON

Up till now we always figured she

had the money -- but you know so

much about it, maybe you've got it.

DYLE

Then what am I doing here? You didn't

know anything about me -- I'm the

only one who could have taken it and

kept right on going.

SCOBIE

He's just tryin' to throw us off!

They've got it, I tell you! Why don't

we search their rooms?

DYLE

(exchanging looks

with REGGIE)

It's all right with us --

TEX

(rising)

What are we wastin' time for? Let's

go.

DYLE

And while we're waiting, we might as

well go through yours.

SCOBIE

(stopping)

Not my room!

DYLE

What's wrong, Herman -- have you got

something to hide?

(a pause, then smiling)

Then I take it there are no

objections.

DYLE

We'd better exchange keys. Here's

mine.

SCOBIE

I'll take that.

TEX

Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy,

y'all.

DYLE

Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets

your vote?

REGGIE

Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

DYLE

(handing her the boy)

He's all yours. I'll do Tex and

Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you --

and make sure you bolt the door from

inside.

REGGIE

Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to

have a treasure hunt.

JEAN-LOUIS

(joining them)

Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will

I win a prize?

REGGIE

(to DYLE)

What should we give him?

DYLE

How about $25,000? Or do you think

it would spoil him?

GIDEON

(eyes on the bag)

Tex?

TEX

What's that?

TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)

Charlie's stuff?

GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)

Looks like it.

TEX

Mebbe we'd better call Herman.

GIDEON

What for? If it's not here, why bother

him?

TEX

And if it is?

GIDEON

(a pause)

Why bother him?

TEX

You sure nuthin's missin'?

GIDEON

No. The police have kindly provided

us with a list.

TEX

There sure ain't nothin' here worth

no quarter of a million.

GIDEON

Not unless we're blind.

TEX

(staring at GIDEON)

You think that mebbe we're fishin'

the wrong stream?

GIDEON

Meaning what?

TEX

You don't s'pose one o' us has it,

like the man said -- I mean, that'd

be pretty distasteful -- us bein'

vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

GIDEON

(very sincerely)

You know I'd tell you if I had it.

TEX

Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.

GIDEON

Nachurly. And that goes for Herman,

too.

TEX & GIDEON

(together)

Nachurly!

REGGIE

-- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly.

Just hurry up and get here.

REGGIE

Come on, now -- if you wanted to

hide something, where would you put

it?

JEAN-LOUIS

I know. I would bury it in the garden.

REGGIE

Swell -- only this man doesn't have

a garden.

JEAN-LOUIS

Oh.

(Afterthought)

Neither do I.

(Seeing something)

Voila!

REGGIE

Voila what?

JEAN-LOUIS

(pointing)

Up there! I would put it up there!

REGGIE

You know something, cookie? Why not?

REGGIE

I hope I don't find any little hairy

things living up here -- wait! There

is something! If I can just -- yes,

I'm getting it -- a case of some

sort -- it's heavy.

JEAN-LOUIS

(jumping up and down)

I found it! I found it!

REGGIE

If you think you're getting credit

for this, you're crazy.

JEAN-LOUIS

(ecstatic)

We won! We won!

JEAN-LOUIS

We found it! We found it!

JEAN-LOUIS

We found it!

DYLE

Reggie -- ? Did you find it?

REGGIE

No.

GIDEON

What do you mean, no?

TEX

The kid said --

JEAN-LOUIS

(pointing atop the

armoire)

Up there! It is up there!

REGGIE

No, Jean-Louis.

REGGIE

It's nothing, I tell you!

TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)

Jumpin' frejoles -- it's Herman's

spare.

REGGIE

Where is he?

TEX

Hey, that's right!

DYLE

(already running)

He's in my room.

JEAN-LOUIS

What is the matter?

DYLE

Reggie -- you and the boy better

wait here.

TEX

Now who'da done a mean thing like

that?

DYLE

(looking carefully at

both)

I'm not quite sure.

TEX

This ain't my room.

GIDEON

Mine, either.

DYLE

(considering the

situation)

The police aren't going to like this

one bit.

GIDEON

(helpful)

We could dry him off and take him

down the hall to his own room.

(looking at the body)

He really doesn't look so bad.

TEX

We could put him to bed 'n let one

o' them fem-de-chambers find him in

the mornin'.

TEX

Poor ol' Herman -- him 'n good luck

always was strangers. Maybe now he'll

meet up with his other hand someplace --

but I sure hope it ain't waitin' for

him in Heaven.

GRANDPIERRE

No! No! No! No!

GRANDPIERRE

A man drowned in his bed --

impossible! And in his pajamas --

the second one in his pajamas --

c'est trop bete! Stop lying to me --

(Tapping the side of

his nose)

this nose tells me when you are lying --

it is never mistaken, not in twenty-

three years -- this nose will make

me commissaire of police.

(Tapping his fingers

on his desk)

Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua -- which is

it?

DYLE

Dyle.

GRANDPIERRE

And yet you registered in Megeve as

Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against

the law to register under an assumed

name?

DYLE

No, I didn't.

REGGIE

It's done in America all the time.

GRANDPIERRE

None of you will be permitted to

leave Paris -- until this matter is

cleared up. Only I warn you -- I

will be watching. We use the

guillotine in this country -- I have

always suspected that the blade coming

down causes no more than a slight

tickling sensation on the back of

the neck. It is only a guess, of

course -- I hope none of you ever

finds out for certain.

REGGIE

Who do you think did it -- Gideon?

DYLE

Maybe.

REGGIE

Or Tex?

DYLE

Maybe.

REGGIE

You're a big help. Can I have one of

those?

REGGIE

(to the VENDOR)

Vanille-chocolat.

REGGIE

I think Tex did it.

DYLE

Why?

REGGIE

Because I really suspect Gideon --

and it is always the person you don't

suspect.

DYLE

Do women think it's feminine to be

so illogical -- or can't they help

it?

REGGIE

What's so illogical about that?

DYLE

A) It's always the person you don't

suspect; B) that means you think

it's Tex because you really suspect

Gideon; therefore C) if you think

it's Tex, it has to be someone else --

Gideon.

REGGIE

Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

DYLE

Who?

REGGIE

Women. You know, I can't help feeling

rather sorry for Scobie.

(a pause)

Wouldn't it be nice if we were like

that?

DYLE

What -- like Scobie?

REGGIE

No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way

he danced down there next to the

river in 'American in Paris' --

without a care in the world? This is

good, want some?

DYLE

(frowning)

I'd love some, thanks.

REGGIE

I'm sorry.

DYLE

No sense messing up the streets.

REGGIE

Alex --

DYLE

Hm?

REGGIE

I'm scared.

DYLE

Don't worry, I'm not going to hit

you.

REGGIE

No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't

think of any reason why he was killed.

DYLE

Maybe somebody felt that four shares

were too many --

REGGIE

What makes you think that this

somebody will be satisfied with three?

He wants it all, Alex -- that means

we're in his way, too.

DYLE

Yes, I know.

REGGIE

First your brother, then Charles,

now Scobie -- we've got to do

something! Any minute now we could

be assassinated! Would you do anything

like that?

DYLE

(surprised)

What? Assassinate somebody?

REGGIE

No --

REGGIE

-- swing down from there on a rope

to save the woman you love -- like

Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback

of Notre Dame'?

REGGIE

Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.

DYLE

Let me know what you want -- I'll

pick a suit that matches.

DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)

What do you want?

REGGIE

It's the house detective -- why

haven't you got a girl in there?

DYLE

Lord, you're a pest.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Can I come in?

DYLE

I'd like to take a bath.

REGGIE

Wouldn't it be better if you did it

in my room?

DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)

What for?

REGGIE

I wouldn't want to use that tub.

Besides, I don't want to be alone.

I'm afraid.

DYLE

I'm only next door -- if anything

happens, holler.

DYLE

Reggie!

REGGIE

Got you.

DYLE

Did you ever hear the story of the

boy who cried wolf?

REGGIE

The shower's in there.

DYLE

(warning)

Reggie -- open the door.

REGGIE

This is a ludicrous situation. There

must be dozens of men dying to use

my shower.

DYLE

Then I suggest you call one of them.

REGGIE

I dare you.

REGGIE

(has she gone too

far?)

What are you doing?

DYLE

Have you ever heard of anyone taking

a shower with his shoes on?

(to himself)

What a nut.

DYLE

I usually sing a medley of old

favorites when I bathe -- any

requests?

REGGIE

Shut the door!

DYLE

I don't think I know that one.

REGGIE

What on earth are you doing?

DYLE

(explaining pleasantly)

Drip-dry!

DYLE

The suit needs it more than I do,

anyway.

REGGIE

How often do you go through this

little ritual?

DYLE

Every day. The manufacturer recommends

it.

REGGIE

I don't believe it.

DYLE

"Wearing this suit during washing

will help protect its shape."

DYLE

Waterproof.

REGGIE

(into phone)

Yes -- ?

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've

spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm

listening.

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

I told them what you said -- about

this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

I asked them what they knew about it

and they told me -- you're not gonna

like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told

me Carson Dyle has no brother.

REGGIE

(pause, quietly)

Are you sure there's no mistake?

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert --

be careful.

DYLE

I left all my drip-dry dripping --

is it all right?

DYLE

Reggie -- is something wrong?

DYLE

You're probably weak from hunger.

You've only had five meals today.

Hurry up and we'll go out.

REGGIE

Do you mind if we go someplace

crowded? I -- I feel like lots of

people tonight.

DYLE

Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word

in twenty minutes.

REGGIE

I keep thinking about Charles and

Scobie -- and the one who's going to

be next -- me?

DYLE

Nothing's going to happen to you

while I'm around -- I want you to

believe that.

REGGIE

How can I believe it when you don't

even know who the killer is? I've

got that right, haven't I? You don't

know who did it.

DYLE

No -- not yet.

REGGIE

But then if we sit back and wait,

the field should start narrowing

down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left

alive at the end will pretty well

have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't

you say so?

DYLE

Are you trying to say that I might

have killed Charles and Scobie?

DYLE

What do I have to do to satisfy you --

become the next victim?

REGGIE

It's a start, anyway.

DYLE

I don't understand you at all -- one

minute you're chasing me around the

shower room and the next you're

accusing me of murder.

REGGIE

Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.

DYLE

I can explain if you'll just listen.

Will you listen?

REGGIE

(looking at the river)

I can't very well leave without a

pair of water wings.

DYLE

Okay. Then get set for the story of

my life -- not that it would ever

make the best-seller list.

REGGIE

Fiction or non-fiction?

DYLE

Why don't you shut up!

REGGIE

Well!

DYLE

Are you going to listen?

REGGIE

Go on.

DYLE

After I graduated college I was all

set to go into my father business.

Umbrella frames -- that's what he

made. It was a sensible business, I

suppose, but I didn't have the sense

to be interested in anything sensible.

REGGIE

I suppose all this is leading

somewhere?

DYLE

It led me away from umbrella frames,

for one thing. But that left me

without any honest means of support.

REGGIE

What do you mean?

DYLE

When a man has no profession except

the one he loathes, what's left? I

began looking for people with more

money than they'd ever need --

including some they'd barely miss.

REGGIE

(astonished)

You mean, you're a thief?

DYLE

Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd

have chosen, but I suppose it captures

the spirit of the thing.

REGGIE

I don't believe it.

DYLE

Well, I can't really blame you --

not now.

REGGIE

But I do believe it -- that's what I

don't believe. So it's goodbye

Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter

Joshua.

DYLE

Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.

REGGIE

Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you

realize you've had three names in

the past two days? I don't even know

who I'm talking to any more.

DYLE

(now called ADAM)

The man's the same, even if the name

isn't.

REGGIE

No -- he's not the same. Alexander

Dyle was interested in clearing up

his brother's death. Adam Canfield

is a crook. And with all the

advantages you've got -- brains,

charm, education, a handsome face --

ADAM

Oh, come on!

REGGIE

-- there has to be a darn good reason

for living the way you do. I want to

know what it is.

ADAM

It's simple. I like what I do -- I

enjoy doing it. There aren't many

men who love their work as much as I

do. Look around some time.

REGGIE

Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

ADAM

Yes, but --

ADAM AND REGGIE

(together)

-- we're divorced.

ADAM

Right. Now go eat your dinner.

REGGIE

(miserably)

I could eat a horse.

ADAM

(looking at all the

food)

I think that's what you ordered.

REGGIE

Don't you dare to be civil with me!

All this time you were leading me on --

ADAM

How was I leading you on?

REGGIE

All that marvelous rejection -- you

knew I couldn't resist it. Now it

turns out you were only interested

in the money.

ADAM

That's right.

REGGIE (HURT)

Oh!

ADAM

What would you like me to say --

that a pretty girl with an outrageous

manner means more to an old pro like

me than a quarter of a million

dollars?

REGGIE

No -- I guess not.

ADAM

It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

REGGIE

What?

ADAM

Don't you know I'm having a tough

time keeping my eyes off of you?

ADAM

Oh, you should see your face.

REGGIE

What about it?

ADAM

(taking her hand,

nicely)

It's lovely.

ADAM

What's the matter?

REGGIE

I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?

REGGIE

(alarmed)

Adam!

ADAM

It's all right -- look.

REGGIE

You don't look so bad in this light.

ADAM

Why do you think I brought you here?

REGGIE

(indicating the lovers)

I thought maybe you wanted me to see

the kind of work the competition was

turning out.

ADAM

Pretty good, huh? I taught them

everything they do.

REGGIE

Oh? Did they do that sort of thing

way back in your day?

ADAM

How do you think I got here?

REGGIE

Aren't you allowed to kiss back?

ADAM

No. The doctor said it would be bad

for my -- thermostat.

ADAM

When you come on, you really come

on.

REGGIE

Well -- come on.

REGGIE

I know why you're not taken -- no

one can catch up with you.

ADAM

Relax -- you're gaining.

GIDEON

Huh? You must be crazy -- it's three-

thirty in the morning -- you mean

now?  -- all right -- I'll be down

in a minute.

GIDEON

Hey! Turn on the lights!

GIDEON

Hey! How do you stop this thing?

GRANDPIERRE

Three of them -- all in their pajamas!

C'est ridicule! What is it, some new

American fad?

GRANDPIERRE

And now your friend -- the one from

Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked

out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is

he?

ADAM

I don't know.

GRANDPIERRE

Madame?

GRANDPIERRE

Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you

at three-thirty?

ADAM

In my room, asleep.

GRANDPIERRE

And you, Mrs. Lampert?

REGGIE

I was, too.

GRANDPIERRE

In Mr. Dyle's room?

REGGIE

(bitterly)

No -- in my room.

GRANDPIERRE

(pause, lighting cigar)

It stands to reason you are telling

the truth -- for why would you invent

such a ridiculous story?

GRANDPIERRE

And if I were you, I would not stay

in my pajamas. Good night.

ADAM

That wraps it up -- Tex has the money.

Go back to bed -- I'll let you know

when I've found him.

REGGIE

You're going to look for him -- now?

ADAM

If the police find him first they're

not very likely to turn over a quarter

of a million dollars to us, are they?

REGGIE

Adam --

ADAM

There's no time -- I'll call you in

the morning.

ADAM

Yes?

TEX

Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my

mama didn't raise no stupid children.

I know who's got the money 'n I ain't

disappearing till I got my share --

'n' my share's growin' a whole lot

bigger ev'ry day.

ADAM

(on the phone)

Where are you, ol' buddy?

TEX

(on the phone)

(laughs)

I'll tell you what, fella -- you

want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round --

from now on I'll be right behind

you.

(hangs up)

REGGIE

What is it?

ADAM

Open up.

ADAM

I think we were wrong about Tex having

the money.

REGGIE

Why?

ADAM

I just heard from him -- he's still

hungry. That means killing Gideon

didn't get it for him -- so he's

narrowed it down to us. You've got

it.

REGGIE

I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

ADAM

Where's that airlines bag?

REGGIE

Lord, you're stubborn.

ADAM

I sure am. Get it.

ADAM

Charles must have had the money with

him on the train, and Tex missed it.

REGGIE

But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's

been through that bag. Somebody would

have seen it.

ADAM

Let's look anyway.

REGGIE

Lord, you're stubborn.

ADAM

I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only

we could see it. We're looking at it

right now.

ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

Something on that bed is worth a

quarter of a million dollars.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yes, but what?

ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

I don't know -- I just don't know.

ADAM

Electric razor -- comb -- steamship

ticket -- fountain pen -- four

passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --

(He goes through the

wallet, finds nothing)

key -- what about that?

REGGIE

To the apartment -- it matches mine

perfectly.

ADAM

The letter --

REGGIE

I'll bet you don't really need those.

REGGIE

You need them.

(She hands them back)

ADAM

(reading the letter)

It still doesn't make sense, but it

isn't worth any quarter of a million

either. Have we forgotten anything?

REGGIE

The tooth powder. Wait a minute --

could you recognize heroin just by

tasting it?

ADAM

Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.

REGGIE

Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.

ADAM

Go to bed. You've got to be at work

in the morning. There's nothing more

we can do tonight.

REGGIE

(pause)

I love you, Adam.

ADAM

Yes, you told me.

REGGIE

No -- last time I said "I love you,

Alex."

ITALIAN DELEGATE

-- di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano

e decisamente a favore per

l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le

tradizioni etniche rispettive delle

culture basilari dei passi in via di

sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i

Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro

risaie ed ai loro campi di soja

tradizionali una raccolta di semola,

non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro

secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto,

e questo e molto importante per il

Governo che io ho l'onore di

rappresentare disturberebbe

l'esportazione delle derrate farinose

italiane in questa parte del mondo.

Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della

vostra attenzione.

REGGIE

I hope Jean-Louis understands about

last night -- it's just not safe for

him to be around me right now.

SYLVIE

Don't be silly -- he would not do

anything. He is not yet old enough

to be interested in girls. He says

collecting stamps is much more

satisfying to a man of his age.

REGGIE

Hold it -- Italy just finished.

They're recognizing Great Britain.

SYLVIE

Oh la vache!

BRITISH DELEGATE

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my

distinguished colleague from Italy.

Her Majesty's delegation has listened

with great patience to the Southern

European position on this problem,

and while we find it charmingly

stated, we cannot possibly agree

with its content. In 1937, in the

British colonies of Kenya, Uganda

and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not

mistaken, more or less in Somaliland --

a programme of crop rotation was

instituted vis-a-vis arable land

which had never before known the

plough, beginning before the soil

was able to know the sort of fatigue

now plaguing most of Western Europe.

In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's

Government -- at that time His

Majesty's Government -- was able to

properly assay the situation. We

therefore oppose the resolution.

ADAM

Reggie -- I think I've found --

(stopping)

are you on?

REGGIE

No, it's all right. What's wrong,

Adam?

ADAM

Nothing's wrong. I think I found

something. I was snooping around

Tex's room and I found this in the

waste basket. I've stuck it back

together.

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre

gave me -- for Charles's things. I

don't see how that's going to --

ADAM

You didn't look. Last night, when we

went through the airlines bag,

something was missing. See -- ?

(showing her the list)

"One agenda." It wasn't there.

REGGIE

You're right. I remember Grandpierre

looking through it. But there was

nothing in it -- at least, nothing

that the police thought was very

important.

ADAM

Can you remember anything at all?

REGGIE

Grandpierre asked me about an

appointment Charles had -- on the

day he was killed.

ADAM

With whom? Where?

REGGIE

I think it only said where -- but I

can't --

ADAM

Think, Reggie, you've got to think --

it may be what we're looking for.

REGGIE

That money's not ours, Adam -- if we

keep it, we'll be breaking the law.

ADAM

Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's

no law against stealing stolen money.

REGGIE

Of course there is!

ADAM

There is? Well, I can't say I think

very much of a silly law like that.

Think, Reggie -- please think --

what was written in Charles' notebook?

REGGIE

Well -- it was a place -- a street

corner, I think. But I don't --

(hearing something

through her earpiece)

Hold it. I'm on.

REGGIE

(translating)

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my

distinguished colleague from Great

Britain --

FRENCH DELEGATE

Monsieur le President, Messieurs les

delegues -- mon distingue collegue

de la Grande Bretagne -- le probleme

vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas

aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais

voudraient nous le faire croire.

Mais leur pays n'est pas, apres tout,

un pays agricole, n'est-ce pas? La

position francaise, ainsi que nous

l'avons soulignee dans le rapport

numero trente-neuf bar oblique

cinquante-deux de la Conference de

l'hemisphere occidental qui a eu

lieu le 22 mars --

REGGIE

as outlined in report number three-

nine-stroke-five-two of the Western

Hemisphere Conference held on March

22 --

(she stops)

no wait! It was last Thursday, five

o'clock at the Jardin des Champs-

Elysees! Adam -- that was it! The

garden!

ADAM

It's Thursday today -- and it's almost

five -- come on!

REGGIE

Now what?

ADAM

Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden --

it's got to be something around here.

REGGIE

But Charles' appointment was last

week, not --

ADAM

I know, but this is all we've got

left.

REGGIE

Well, you're right there. Ten minutes

ago I had a job.

ADAM

Stop grousing. If we find the money

I'll buy you an international

conference all your own. Now start

looking. You take this side and I'll

poke around over there.

REGGIE

It's hopeless -- I don't even know

what we're looking for.

ADAM

It's all right -- I don't think Tex

does, either.

REGGIE

Tex? You mean he's here, too?

ADAM

Look.

ADAM

I'd better see what he's up to.

Stay here -- I won't be long.

REGGIE

(concerned)

Be careful, Adam -- please. He's

already killed three men.

TEX

Sorry, fella --

ADAM

(amazed)

The letter.

ADAM

Taxi! -- Taxi!

ADAM

(quietly)

All right -- where's the letter?

TEX

The letter? The letter ain't worth

nuthin'.

ADAM

You know what I mean -- the envelope

with the stamps. I want it.

TEX

(a pause, then

beginning to laugh)

You greenhorn -- you half-witted,

thick-skulled, hare-brained,

greenhorn! They wuz both too smart

for us!

ADAM

What are you talking about?

TEX

First her husband, now her -- she

hoodwinked you! She batted all them

big eyes and you went 'n fell for it -

like a egg from a tall chicken!

Here!

(holding out the

envelope)

You want? Here -- it's yours!

TEX

Look at you! Horn-swoggled by a purty

face 'n all them sweet words! You

killed all three of 'em for nothin'!

You greenhorn! You block-headed

jackass! You clod -- you booby --

you nincompoop -- !

REGGIE

Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?

SYLVIE

(looking up)

Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for

Jean-Louis.

REGGIE

(looking around)

What's he up to?

SYLVIE

He was so excited -- when he got the

stamps you gave him this morning. He

said he had never seen any like them.

REGGIE

I'm glad. But what's all this?

SYLVIE

The stamp market, of course -- it is

here every Thursday afternoon. This

is where Jean-Louis trades his --

REGGIE

(as it dawns)

Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he?

Sylvie -- we've got to find him!

SYLVIE

What's the matter, cherie?

REGGIE

Those stamps -- they're worth a

fortune!

SYLVIE

(jumping up)

What?

REGGIE

A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to

find him!

REGGIE

I don't see him.

SYLVIE

We will separate -- you look over

there.

SYLVIE

(calling)

Jean-Louis -- ?

REGGIE

Jean-Louis!

SYLVIE

Jean-Louis!

SYLVIE

Jean-Louis -- les timbres -- ou sont-

ils?

SYLVIE

Oh, zut!

(calling)

Reggie -- Reggie -- !

REGGIE

Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you

have -- !

(spotting the sack of

stamps)

What's that?

JEAN-LOUIS

A man traded with me -- all those

for only four.

REGGIE

Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?

SYLVIE

Vite, mon ange -- vite!

JEAN-LOUIS

La bas -- Monsieur Felix.

JEAN-LOUIS

Il est la!

JEAN-LOUIS

But he is gone.

REGGIE

I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do

you know where this Monsieur Felix

lives?

JEAN-LOUIS

No -- but I will ask.

JEAN-LOUIS

Monsieur Theophile --

THEOPHILE

Oui, jeune homme?

JEAN-LOUIS

Monsieur Felix, ou habite-il?

THEOPHILE

A Montmartre -- demande a Monsieur

August au Bar des Artistes -- Place

Blanche.

JEAN-LOUIS

Merci, Monsieur Theophile.

(returning to REGGIE

and SYLVIE)

He says to ask Monsieur August at

the --

FELIX

Entrez.

REGGIE

Monsieur Felix -- ?

FELIX

(without looking up)

I was expecting you. You are American

too, of course.

REGGIE

(looking at SYLVIE)

Yes.

FELIX

The man who bought them last week

was American. I did not see him but

I heard. I knew you would come.

FELIX

Look at them, Madame.

FELIX (O.S.)

Have you ever, in your entire life,

seen anything so beautiful?

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, FELIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS

REGGIE

I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know

anything about stamps.

FELIX

I know them as one knows his own

face, even though I have never seen

them. This yellow one -- a Swedish

four shilling -- called 'De Gula

Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.

REGGIE

How much is it worth?

FELIX

The money is unimportant.

REGGIE

I'm afraid it is important.

FELIX

(shrugging)

In your money, perhaps $65,000.

REGGIE

Do you mind if I sit down?

(she sits)

What about the blue one?

FELIX

It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and

there are only seven left. In 1894

the owner of one was murdered by a

rival collector who was obsessed to

own it.

REGGIE

What's its value today?

FELIX

In human life? In greed? In suffering?

REGGIE

In money.

FELIX

Forty-five thousand.

REGGIE

(to SYLVIE)

Do you have anything to eat?

(to FELIX)

And the orange one -- what about the

orange one?

FELIX

A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in

1856. Not so rare as the others --

$30,000 perhaps.

REGGIE

And the last one?

FELIX

The best for the last -- le chef-

d'oeuvre de la collection. The

masterpiece. It is the most valuable

stamp in the world. It is called

'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed

by hand on colored paper in 1852 and

marked with the initials of the

printer.

(looking at it through

the glass)

Today it has a value of $100,000.

(a pause)

Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew

there was some mistake. Take them.

REGGIE

(hesitating)

You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps

in return, Monsieur Felix -- are

they for sale now?

FELIX

(looking at the large

bag)

Let me see. There are 350 European,

200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African

and twelve Princess Grace

commemorative -- which comes to nine

francs fifty.

REGGIE

(fishing money from

her purse)

Here's ten.

REGGIE

Please keep it.

FELIX

I am a tradesman, Madame, not a

doorman. And don't forget these.

REGGIE

I'm -- I'm sorry.

FELIX

No. For a few minutes they were mine --

that is enough.

REGGIE

Adam? Adam? It's me, Reggie -- !

REGGIE

(gasping)

Dyle --

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Hello -- Balzac 30-04, s'il vous

plait --

(waiting)

Mr. Bartholomew! Thank God you're

there! Tex is dead, Mr. Bartholomew --

smothered -- and Adam did it -- he

killed them all!

BARTHOLOMEW

Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd

better give that to me slowly. Who's

Adam?

REGGIE

(on the phone)

The one who said he was Dyle's brother --

of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the

word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the

murderer I tell you -- he's the only

one left! You've got to do something!

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please.

Does he have the money?

REGGIE

(on the phone)

No, I do -- it was the stamps on

that letter Charles had with him on

the train. They were in plain sight

all the time, but no one ever bothered

looking at the envelope.

BARTHOLOMEW

(on the phone)

The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs.

Lampert, listen to me -- you're not

safe as long as you've got these

stamps. Go to the Embassy right away --

wait, I'd better meet you halfway --

it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do

you know the center garden at the

Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade --

as soon as you can get there. Hurry,

Mrs. Lampert.

REGGIE

(on the phone)

Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

ADAM

Reggie -- the stamps -- what've you

done with --?

ADAM

Where are you going? Wait!

ADAM

Reggie!

ADAM

Reggie!

ADAM

Reggie -- stop!

REGGIE

Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is

dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle

did it!

ADAM

I'm not Dyle -- you know that!

REGGIE

But Tex didn't -- he still thought --

!

ADAM

Don't be an idiot!

ADAM

Reggie -- ! I want those stamps!

REGGIE

(indicating the

direction)

Palais Royal -- vite!

DRIVER

(pointing the other

way)

Porte d'Italie, moi.

REGGIE

Mais c'est tres vite! On veut me

teur!

DRIVER

(shaking his head)

Italie.

GUARD

Billet, Monsieur.

ADAM

(breathless)

I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm

only trying --

GUARD

(pointing off)

Billet, Monsieur.

REGGIE

(to herself)

Come on -- please --

TRAIN GUARD

Billet, Monsieur.

TRAIN GUARD

Vous etes dans le premier classe,

Monsieur.

ADAM

What?

TRAIN GUARD

(heavy accent)

This car is for first class only --

you have a second-class ticket.

ADAM

But that's what they gave me.

GENDARME

Monsieur -- ?

REGGIE

(to herself, as she

dials)

Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4.

REGGIE

Embassies -- embassies --

REGGIE

Shh.

(into the phone,

whispering)

American Embassy? Mr. Bartholomew's

office, please -- Mr. Bartholomew's

office --

OPERATOR

Could you speak out, please? I can't

quite hear you.

REGGIE

(on the phone)

No, I can't speak any louder --

Hamilton Bartholomew -- B as in --

uh -- Bartholomew -- that's right,

and the rest as in Bartholomew!

OPERATOR

(on the phone)

I'm sorry, but Mr. Bartholomew has

left for the day.

REGGIE

(on the phone)

But someone's trying to kill me --

you've got to send word to him -- in

the center garden of the Palais Royal,

by the colonnade -- tell him I'm

trapped in a phone booth, below him

in the Metro station. And my name's

Lampert.

OPERATOR

(on the phone)

All right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'll see

what I can do. Goodbye.

OPERATOR

Hello, Mr. Bartholomew? -- there was

a call for you just now, Mr.

Bartholomew -- it sounded quite urgent --

a Mrs. Lampert.

REAL BARTHOLOMEW

Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert --

trapped in a Metro station? Who does

she think I am, the C.I.A.? All right,

you'd better call the French police.

ADAM

(calling)

Reggie -- !

ADAM

(in b.g., calling)

Reggie -- wait!

ADAM

Reggie -- why won't you listen?

REGGIE

I'm through listening to you!

ADAM

But I didn't kill anybody.

REGGIE

Then who did? You're the only one

left.

ADAM

Reggie -- please believe me!

REGGIE

No!

REGGIE

Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!

ADAM

Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!

REGGIE

(breathless)

Carson -- ?

"BARTHOLOMEW"

(calmly)

We all know Carson Dyle is dead,

Mrs. Lampert.

ADAM

It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!

"BARTHOLOMEW"

You're not going to believe him,

Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic.

He's trying to trick you again.

ADAM

Tex recognized him -- that's why he

said Dyle. If you give him those

stamps, he'll kill you too!

"BARTHOLOMEW"

Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said,

what's preventing me from killing

you right now?

ADAM

Because he'd have to come out to get

the stamps -- he knows he'd never

make it.

"BARTHOLOMEW"

What's the matter with you, Mrs.

Lampert? Are you going to believe

every lie he tells you? He wants the

money for himself -- that's all he's

ever wanted.

REGGIE

(to ADAM, explaining)

He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen

him at the Embassy.

ADAM

Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!

"BARTHOLOMEW"

That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a

dead man -- look at me.

REGGIE

I don't know who anybody is any more!

ADAM

Reggie -- listen to me!

REGGIE

You lied to me so many times --

ADAM

(gently)

Reggie -- trust me once more --

please.

REGGIE

Can I really believe you this time,

Adam?

ADAM

(a pause)

There's not a reason on earth why

you should.

REGGIE

All right, Adam.

"BARTHOLOMEW"

Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or

I'll kill you.

ADAM

It won't get you the stamps, Dyle --

You'll have to come out to get them,

and I'm not likely to miss at this

range.

"BARTHOLOMEW"

(now called CARSON)

Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of

bullets to kill me. They left me

there with five of them in my legs

and my stomach -- they knew I was

still alive but they left me. I spent

ten months in a German camp -- with

nothing to stop the pain and no food --

they were willing to take all these

chances for the money, but not for

me. They deserved to die!

REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

But I didn't have anything to do

with --

CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

You've got the money. It belongs to

me now! Please believe me, Mrs.

Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little

more blood won't matter.

CARSON

I'll give you five to make up your

mind, Mrs. Lampert.

REGGIE

Wait, please! I need some time to

think!

CARSON

One --

CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

-- two --

CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

-- three --

CARSON

-- four --

REGGIE

Adam -- please!

CARSON

All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game's

over. Come out of there.

CARSON

I don't want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert --

but I will --

CARSON

Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ?

CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert

CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert --

GRANDPIERRE

Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for

the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman

Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold

Gideon, and whoever that is down

there.

ADAM

Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He

wouldn't dare hit a girl.

REGGIE

You didn't have to chase me so hard --

ADAM

Here, give it to me.

REGGIE

That one's done -- start on this

one.

REGGIE

I'm sorry I thought you were the

murderer, Adam -- how did I know

that he was as big a liar as you

are?

ADAM

And that's all the gratitude I get

for saving your hide.

REGGIE

The truth, now -- was it my hide --

or the stamps?

ADAM

What a terrible thing to say. How

could you even think that?

REGGIE

All right, prove it to me -- tell me

to go to the Embassy first thing in

the morning and turn in those stamps.

REGGIE

I said, tell me to go to the --

ADAM

I heard you, I heard you.

REGGIE

Then say it.

ADAM

Reggie -- listen to me --

REGGIE

Never mind -- I'll go by myself.

ADAM

What makes you think they're even

interested? It's only a quarter of a

million -- it'll cost more than that

to fix up their bookkeeping. As a

taxpayer --

REGGIE

(to ADAM)

Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay

taxes.  Excuse me, soldier --

MARINE

Marine, ma'am.

REGGIE

Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding

the return of stolen Government money?

MARINE

You might try the Treasury Department,

ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr.

Cruikshank.

REGGIE

Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine.

ADAM

Do you mind if I wait out here? The

sight of all that money being given

away might make me break out.

REGGIE

Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is

Lampert.

SECRETARY

Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss --

REGGIE

Mrs.

SECRETARY

-- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes

sir.

(to REGGIE)

Go right in.

REGGIE

(blowing up)

Well, of all the mean, rotten,

contemptible, crooked --

CRUIKSHANK

Crooked? I should think you'd be

glad to find out I wasn't crooked.

REGGIE

You couldn't even be honest about

being dishonest. Why didn't you say

something?

CRUIKSHANK

We're not allowed to tell. May I

have the stamps, please?

REGGIE

(reaching into her

bag)

Here --

(hesitating)

Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle

get an office in here, anyway?

CRUIKSHANK

When did you see him -- what time, I

mean?

REGGIE

Around one.

CRUIKSHANK

The lunch hour. He probably worked

it out in advance. He found an office

that was usually left open and just

moved in for the time you were here.

REGGIE

Then how do I know this is your

office?

CRUIKSHANK

(picking up the phone)

Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to

Bartholomew at Security recommending

that --

REGGIE

Bartholomew?

CRUIKSHANK

-- recommending that all Embassy

offices be locked during the lunch

hour.

REGGIE

Starting with his own.

CRUIKSHANK

(hanging up)

Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.

REGGIE

What's your first name today?

CRUIKSHANK

Brian.

REGGIE

Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve

me right if I got stuck with that

one.

CRUIKSHANK

Who asked you to get stuck with any

of them?

REGGIE

Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

CRUIKSHANK

Yes.

REGGIE

But you're -- divorced?

CRUIKSHANK

No.

REGGIE

(crestfallen)

Oh.

CRUIKSHANK

My mother -- she lives in Detroit.

Come on now -- give me those stamps.

REGGIE

Only if you can prove to me that

you're really Brian Cruikshank.

CRUIKSHANK

How about if next week some time I

put it on a marriage license -- that

ought to --

REGGIE

Quit stalling -- I want to see some

identification -- now!

CRUIKSHANK

I wouldn't lie on a thing like that --

I could go to jail.

REGGIE

You'd lie about anything.

CRUIKSHANK

Well, maybe we'd better forget about

it, then.

REGGIE

You can't prove it, can you? You're

still trying to --

(the coin drops into

the slot)

marriage license! Did you say -- ?

CRUIKSHANK

I didn't say anything. Will you give

me those stamps?

REGGIE

You did too say it -- I heard you.

Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex --

er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have

lots of boys -- we can name them all

after you.

CRUIKSHANK

Before we start on that, do you mind

handing over the stamps?

FADE OUT:
