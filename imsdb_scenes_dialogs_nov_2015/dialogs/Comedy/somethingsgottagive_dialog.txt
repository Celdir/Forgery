SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE

Nancy Meyers

June 14, 2002

1.

HARRY (V.O.)

Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated

satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That

fleeting age when everything just falls

right into place. It's magic time and it

can render any man, anywhere --

absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an

expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's

'cause I've been dating them for over

forty years...

HARRY

(to Hostess)

Langer. ..

MAITRE'D

Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.

HARRY (V.O.)

So what does a life of bucking the system

all add up to?

2.

HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

To never settle down with the right woman

for a life of leftovers and Christmas

mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no

mini van parked in the garage. I think

it's made me what I am today.

(Harry smiles to someone

across the room)

The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.

Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I

should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.

HARRY (V.O.)

It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my

life would be like if I was a Regular Joe

and came in here once a month with a dame

my age' for a porterhouse and a side of

NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION

HARRY (V.O.)

No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame

really my age. . .

HARRY (V.O.)

There you have it. The story in a

nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?

(Harry TRIPS, his wife

looks disgusted)

Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at

me. I look like I'm about to die. God

help me. I do not want to die.

SMASH CUT TO:

3.

MARIN

( singing)

To all my thugs that be livin' it

up, we say, what I do. To all my...

(stops)

Oh! This is it. Make a right.

HARRY

(admiring the

neighborhood)

So baby, you're rich... .

MARIN

Well, my mother is, sort of. Not

really...

HARRY

If she lives within a mile of here, she's

rich.

MARIN

I guess a hit play will buy you a house

in The Hamptons.

HARRY

I'd like to meet your mother.

MARIN

No you wouldn't. I mean, she's

great. She's totally brilliant, but

she's not your type.

HARRY

You're overlooking one of the great

things about me. I don't have a type.

MARIN

(very directly)

She's over thirty.

MARIN

Oh, what?! Like you don't know you

have a slight reputation for...

4.

HARRY

-- For what?

MARIN

For never dating anyone over 30.

Don't look at me like that.

HARRY

It's just not true.

MARIN

Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

HARRY

Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The

Hamptons to let me know you're a wise

ass.

(answers phone)

Hold on. . .

(then to Marin)

It just so happens, my dear, that women

of a certain age, don't date me. You ever

think of it that way? No, it's always me.

You dames are all alike.

(then into phone)

Hey...

MARIN

(amused, to herself)

Dames...

BARRY

(into phone)

Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who

else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't

find me. Who?

(glances at Marin, she's

not listening)

I'll call her later. No, I have it.

5.

MARIN

(all business)

Make a right, left at the second

fence.

HARRY

Have I mentioned how gorgeous your

breasts look in this sweater?

MARIN

(blushing)

Yes you have actually.

HARRY

So it would be too much to mention it

again. . .

HARRY

Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

MARIN

I know. My mother doesn't know how

to do things that aren't perfect.

HARRY

Which explains you.

MARIN

(trying to keep up with

him)

Yeah, okay, right...

overnight bags and step out of the car.

ARRY

So, what are we gonna do out here,

just the two of us, for two whole

days?

MARIN

Tell me the truth, are you at all

glad we waited?

6.

HARRY

I'm incredibly glad we're finally

going to do it.

(she's a bit disappointed)

If that's the same as being glad we

waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.

HARRY

(slaps her tush)

Let's go for a swim, how long will

it take you to change?

MARIN

Two minutes.

MARIN

Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My

Mom doesn't allow it.

HARRY

But she allows you to strip in the

front yard and bring men you're

dating here to...

MARIN

She doesn't know everything I do...Or

when I do it.. or where I do it.

MARIN

(TAKING OFF her belt)

The fabulous living room, perfect for

entertaining an intimate group of friends

or that special someone.

(DROPS her belt then

UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)

Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck

complete with pool and ocean view.

7.

MARIN (CONT'D)

(UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)

Your pants, please...

HARRY

Ladies first.

MARIN

Gourmet kitchen's to your left

where tonight I will whip you up a

culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.

MARIN

(smiling)

.. O-kay, going quickly now...

Master bedroom is that away...

M

ARIN

And this as they say on 'Cribs',

your favorite show, is where the

magic happens. Do we like it? Going

once, going twice ...

HARRY

Sold.

MARIN

You know when I first started

auctioneering someone told me if I was

nervous to just picture everyone in the

audience in their underwear. This sort of

gives that a whole new meaning.

HARRY

Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

MARIN

I'm always a little nervous.

HARRY

(removing his hands)

So put on your bathing suit. I brought

some champagne, I'll put it on ice.

8.

MARIN

Me like you, Harry Langer.

E

RICA

Oh God. What is this?

ERICA

(in control)

Okay, stay right where you are. We have a

knife.

9.

HARRY

(eyeing the knife)

Do you... live here?

ERICA

Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial

911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,

hand me the phone.

(reaches out to Zoe

without looking at her)

HARRY

You don't understand. I'm a friend

of your daughter's.

ERICA

Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in

the city and you what, wandered in

here,like high on Ecstasy..?.

(looks at phone)

Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.

(redials)

HARRY

(calmly starts to move)

Honestly, if you just...

ERICA

Back off. She was in the Israeli

army. She can break you in half.

ERICA

(into phone)

Yes. I have an intruder in my

house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

HARRY

I'm dating your daughter Marin. She

invited me here for the weekend.

She's in her room right now,

changing.

ERICA

(GASPS even louder, really

scared now)

You're dating my daughter?

10.

HARRY

(amused)

Now who would've thought that would

be worse news?

MARIN

Oh, fuck.

ERICA

Oh, God.

(into phone)

I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm

sure. No, he's not a burglar

(with enormous difficulty)

He's dating my daughter.

MARIN

Mom, I had no idea you were coming out

this weekend, you said you had to write.

ERICA

I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

MARIN

Oh, man, this is really....

ERICA

Awkward.

MARIN

Totally.. .but....

(starts laughing)

You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought

he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

ERICA

Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I

don't know the man. . .

MARIN

(still laughing)

I'm sorry, it's not really funny.

I'm an idiot. I should've told you

I was bringing someone out.

E

RICA

No, no, I should've told you we

were coming. Well. Anyway, here we

are.

(waves to Harry)

Hello. I'm the mother.

11.

HARRY

Harry Langer. How are ya?

MARIN

Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,

Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,

Zoe.

(they all shake hands)

Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I

mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,

totally spur of the moment thought we'd

get out of the city for a few days.

ERICA AND ZOE

Of course...Right...Great...

ERICA

(can't look at him)

Honey, does Harry have a robe?

HARRY

(backing out)

You know what? Actually, I think I should

just take off. Let you gals enjoy your

weekend...

ERICA

No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,

here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will

leave. We took a great walk on the beach,

we'll go into town for lunch. You two

stay. Harry, apologize about the near

arrest.

HARRY

No, you were impressive. Very strong,

very... "macho".

ERICA

(a little thrown)

I don't think I was exactly "macho"

...

HARRY

Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in

his underwear in my refrigerator I

hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs

uh...

12.

ERICA

(already hating him)

Yeah. Okay. Whatever...

HARRY

All righty then...I'm definitely gonna

hit the road.

(salutes Erica and Zoe)

Ladies...sensational meeting you.

(then to Marin)

Doll, call me.

ZOE

Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so

dramatic here. What are we four

teenagers? We're all sophisticated

people. Why can't we all stay, for the

weekend? Your mother's got work to do

I've got papers to grade. You'll do your

thing, whatever that is and if we want to

hang together, we'll hang together. If we

don't, we don't. There's no reason why

any of us should give up this spectacular

weekend.

MARIN

Seriously. I can handle it.

ZOE

I can totally handle it.

ERICA

(on the spot)

I mean, well, I can "handle" it...

HARRY

It can only go up from here.

CUT TO:

Z

OE (V.O.)

He's obviously a penis substitute.

13.

ZOE

I mean a father substitute.

ERICA

Except he's older than her father. I

can't even look at them. What is she

doing with a guy that age?

ZOE

Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

ERICA

Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

ZOE

Okay, so she was old enough not to

feel Dave was walking out on her.

ERICA

Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out

on me? Why do people assume when you

break up after twenty years that the

guy's the one who wanted out? Just

because once we broke up he shtupped

everything that moved...

ZOE

Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.

Just trying to figure out why such a

smart girl is always with the wrong guy.

YOUNG FRENCH GIRL

Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir

aujourd'hui?

ERICA

Bonjour je veux une partie de votre

pate merveilleux et de votre

meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.

14.

HARRY

That's impressive.

MARIN

She started French lessons after she and

my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,

Don't Look Back" program. She's

practically fluent now.

ERICA

(turning back to Marin)

Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou

devrions jefaire quelgue chose?

MARIN

(with an impeccable

accent)

Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et

ce grand gateau de chocolat?

HARRY

Hey, not bad.. .

MARIN

(shrugs)

Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right

back.

ERICA

It's an epidemic.

Y

OUNG FRENCH GIRL

Merci madame.

ERICA

(backing off)

Woops. Sorry.

15.

HARRY

My fault.

ERICA

So, Harry... What do you do?

HARRY

I'm one of the owners of a record

company among other things...

ERICA

Oh, really? Which record company?

HARRY

Drive by Records.

ERICA

(appalled at the name)

"Drive By" Records??? Is that a

joke? What is that?

HARRY

It's a Hip Hop label.

ERICA

Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.

(with disdain)

Okay. That's... "interesting"...

HARRY

Let me see if I get where you're

headed here. . .

ERICA

I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate

rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent

and crude for my taste, not to mention

just a tad misogynistic.

HARRY

Hey, a lot of people see rapping as

poetry.

ERICA

Yeah, but come on, how many words

can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?

MARIN

(joining Harry)

How we doin?

16.

HARRY

Should've left when she tried to arrest

me.

MARIN

So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'

happy with it?

ERICA

Well, the thing with me is that I'm about

90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the

talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

ZOE

Yeah, right...

HARRY

What's your play about?

ERICA

About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which

is a bit of a problem, but so far it's

about a divorced woman, a writer, she's

this high strung, over-amped,

controlling, know it all neurotic. . .

(everyone stares at her)

Who's incredibly cute and lovable.

(more stares)

It's a comedy.

(takes a seat next to Zoe)

M

So, how did you two meet?

ARIN

At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was

the big buyer of the night.

HARRY

I kept winking at Marin as she was

conducting the auction and apparently

every time I did that she misunderstood

and I ended up buying cases of

outrageously expensive wine.

17.

ERICA

Ever been married, Harry?

HARRY

No. No, I haven't.

ERICA

Wow. Now why do you think that is?

HARRY

Some people just don't fit the mold. And

so far...

ERICA

Hey, if it ain't broke.

HARRY

Exactly.

ZOE

Wait a second, aren't you like a famous

bachelor?

HARRY

I wouldn't say I'm famous.

ZOE

No, I think I read a piece on you

in New York Magazine.

HARRY

I guess people find it interesting

that I've escaped the noose for so

long.

ZOE

Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,

"The Escape Artist"?

ERICA

Wait. I read that article. That was you?

You were once engaged to somebody big.

Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.

..Carly Simon?

ZOE

Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.

(trying to remember)

Not Martha Stewart....

18.

MARIN

You could just ..'ask him.

HARRY

No, this is more fun. It's like I'm

not here.

MARIN

Harry was once engaged to Diane

Sawyer. Okay?

ZOE

Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

ERICA

(stunned)

I'm impressed.

HARRY

Yeah, women your age love that

about me.

HARRY

(trying to get thru this)

You know what I mean.

ERICA

Yes I do.

HARRY

It's not a bad thing to say 'women

your age'.

ERICA

No...I'm sure it was a compliment.

HARRY

It was. ..just the truth.

ZOE

(stepping in)

So when was this engagement?

HARRY

Long time ago. She was just this

adorable lanky girl from Kentucky

with the greatest pair of legs I'd

ever seen... Never understood her

ending up with a job where she

never showed them.

(munches on his lobster)

19.

ERICA

HARRY

ZOE

MARIN

(warning him)

oe teaches Women's Studies at

HARRY

ZOE

ERICA

ZOE

(to Marin)

20.

ZOE(cont'd)

--forgive me honey for saying this,

but they want girls that look like

Marin so the whole over fifty

dating scene is geared completely

towards men leaving older women out

and as a result that makes the

older women more and more

productive and more and more

interesting, which, in turn, makes

them even less desirable because as

we all know -- men, especially

older men, are threatened and

deathly afraid of interesting and

accomplished women. It's just so

clear. Single older women, as a

demographic, are as fucked a group

as can ever exist.

ERICA

What are you, possessed? How could

you say those things?

ZOE

It just seemed so obvious to me. The

injustice of it. Thank God men die

younger than us. It's the only break we

get.

ERICA

Then you know what? Write a dissertation

on it, don't announce to the world that I

stay in night after night after night and

by the way, one night after night would

have been enough. Did you ever realize, I

stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you

think I married the director of my plays?

He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I

like staying in and I like this time in

my life. Why do I have to defend myself?

arin ENTERS carrying more dishes.

MARIN

What the hell was that?

21.

ZOE

ERICA

MARIN

ERICA

MARIN

ERICA

MARIN

ERICA

MARIN

ERICA

MARIN

ERICA

(hugs her)

22.

MARIN

(hugs her back)

I love you more.

ZOE

No chance he said we were nice.

ERICA

Please. None.

ZOE

What are they listening to?

ERICA

I don't care...

(listens)

Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .

ERICA

I know she'll never see him after

this weekend. She can't commit

either.

ZOE

He does sound fun.

ZOE

Admit it, he's got something. You

felt it, right?

ERICA

Oh, this is nuts...

ERICA

Did she say, Mom?

23.

MARIN

We were fooling around and he said he

felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.

ARRY

(out of breath)

It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was

the lobster...

ERICA

Does your chest hurt?

HARRY

Like an elephant's standing on it.

ERICA

(to Marin)

Call 911...tell them to send an

ambulance. . .

ERICA

Marin! Now!

ZOE(O.S.)

What are you doing?

ERICA

(coming closer)

Mouth to mouth...

ERICA

You fucking guy...

24.

JULIAN

How we doing here?

PARAMEDIC #1

He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,

nausea, shortness of breath, blood

pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,

respirations 18...

JULIAN

Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm

Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain

right now?

HARRY

Feel some pressure in my

chest...it's real tight.

JULIAN

Can you show me where the pain is?

JULIAN

What were you doing at the onset of

the pain?

HARRY

I was uh, kissing a beautiful...

25.

JULIAN

(watching the monitor)

Where you having intercourse?

HARRY

-- Unfortunately, no.

JULIAN

S

ense of humor in tact...

(checks EKG)

Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.

Langer the EKG shows you have a

blocked artery which is not

allowing enough oxygen to get to

the heart muscle.. .

HARRY

I'm having a heart attack?

JULIAN

We're gonna stop it. But I need to

know what kind of medications you

take?

HARRY

(scared shitless)

I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .

JULIAN

(reading the EKG tape)

Uh-huh... .Any thing else?

HARRY

-- and a white one for blood

pressure. . .

JULIAN

procardia?

HARRY

Yeah.

JULIAN

What about, Viagra?

JULIAN

Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra

today? Mr. Langer?

HARRY

No. No Viagra.

26.

JULIAN

You're positive?

HARRY

I don't take Viagra. Don't need

Viagra.

JULIAN

Great. Just needed to be sure

because I put nitroglycerin into

your-drip and if you had taken

Viagra, the combo would make your

heart leap right out of your

body...

JULIAN

Let's give him an aspirin and

Metoprolol 5mg...

HARRY

Sorry, had an audience...

(clutching his chest)

JULIAN

It's okay. ..it was a great save.

(to Nurse)

Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.

"4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if

this works and I have every reason to

believe it will, it's going to reverse

what's going on so there will be little

or no damage to your heart. You with me?

(Harry nods. Julian places

his hand on Harry's)

Okay, here we go.

MARIN

Oh, man, what if he doesn't make

it? I don't know who to contact.

27.

MARIN (CONT'D)

I don't know his family. I've gone

out to dinner with the guy three

times. I hardly know him.

ERICA

He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

M

He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

ARIN

This is a nightmare. I go out with

a guy who's so old, he takes

Viagra.

ERICA

Are you nuts? You go out with a guy

who's so old he's having a heart

attack!

ZOE

All I can say is, thank God it didn't

happen when he was inside you. That could

be life altering.

JULIAN

Your Dad's gonna be okay.

MARIN

Oh, he's not my Dad...

JULIAN

I'm sorry.

(then)

Your Grandad's gonna be okay.

MARIN

(throws her arms around

him)

Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...

oh we're not related. He's just a friend.

JULIAN

Sorry.

JULIAN

I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a

mild heart attack. I gave him something

to break up the clot in his artery and it

worked beautifully.

28.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

His EKG returned to normal almost

immediately which means I don't expect

any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

ERICA

(shoulders sagging)

Thank you. . .

JULIAN

No, whoever got him here so fast should

be thanked. Another half hour and I don't

know if this would've worked.

ERICA

Oh, man...

(realizing it all now)

This was...intense.

JULIAN

We're out of the woods. I've given him

something to sleep, it might make him a

little loopy at first but then it should

knock him out.

(to Erica)

You're Mrs. Langer?

ERICA

No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .

He was having dinner at our house. I just

met him this afternoon.

JULIAN

You're Erica Barry?

ERICA

Yes.

JULIAN

The playwright?

ERICA

Yes...

JULIAN

What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.

Huge fan.

ERICA

Really? Oh, thanks... This is my

daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...

29.

JULIAN

Wow.

M

ARIN

Thanks.

ZOE

Thank you Doctor.

ERICA

Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.

JULIAN

(eyes on Erica)

You're welcome. May I join you?

ERICA

Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of

you.

JULIAN

First year of medical school you

learn what can keep you up all

night without making you nuts.

Green Tea beats everything plus

it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.

MARIN

(turning on the charm)

So, urn, do you always work nights?

30.

JULIAN

Usually two or-three a week, gives

me a chance for a real life during

the day. . .

(immediately turns back to

Erica)

You know, I heard you had a place

in the Hamptons. I really am a very

big fan. I honestly think I've seen

every play you've ever written.

ERICA

I think some were written before

your time. There are some Marin's

never even seen.

JULIAN

No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them

all and I saw the last one twice.

NURSE

Doctor, we've got a walk in, may

need stitches. . .

JULIAN

(rises)

I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's

asleep; you all might want to get

some shut eye and come back in the

morning. Great to meet you Erica.

Ladies. . .

ERICA

(to Marin)

Okay, now that's a perfect a guy

for you. He's adorable.

MARIN

Mother! I've never seen a man less

interested in me.

ZOE

Or more interested in you.

ERICA

Me? He's thirty years old.

MARIN

No, he's older than that.

31.

ZOE

Who cares how old, he is. I mean,

he's not my type, he's like a

gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's

perfect for you and hot for you,

which makes him really perfect.

ERICA

Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.

(they just stare at her)

It's insane. I would never.

(off Zoe's look)

Shut. Up.

Z

OE

Yuh-oh.

MARIN

(rises)

Harry....

MARIN

Harry! Over here!

HARRY

Honey, I want to go home. Can you

call Lowell to pick me up?

MARIN

(confused)

Lowell?

ERICA

Harry, you have to get back in bed.

HARRY

Woman. And I say that as a

compliment... You saved my life.

(kisses her hand)

Soft.. .

( then)

I don't remember your name but I

thank you from the bottom of my...

32.

ERICA

(afraid to breathe)

Ugh. Look at this, even

unconscious, he's a lech.

NURSE

Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be

standing.

HARRY

Got to take a whiz girls.

NURSE

We'll take care of that for you,

Mr. Langer.

HARRY

Okay. You take care of it for me,

sweetheart. I'd like to see that...

MARIN

This is the most insane night of my

life.

ZOE

Yeah, but just admit that was one

great ass for a guy that age.

NURSE

Now what can I do you for?

LOWELL

I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.

33.

NURSE

(to Julian)

Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?

JULIAN

Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.

Come on, I'll take you to him.

J

ULIAN

And you are. . ?

LOWELL

Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's

houseman, chef... general valet..

JULIAN

Well that sounds like a pretty,

interesting job.

LOWELL

Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.

JULIAN

Okay, Harry, looks like we're going

to have to let you go.

HARRY

Take it easy kids, I just sat up

too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in

good shape? How were my tests this

morning?

JULIAN

He's doing extremely well.

LOWELL

(holding back tears)

Can I hug him?

34.

JULIAN

Absolutely.

HARRY

Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We

got no thin , but good news here.

LOWELL

I must say, you do look good...

considering. You have a little

extra baggage under your eyes, but

I know how to fix that.

HARRY

(to Julian)

See what good hands I'm in. Did you

meet my gorgeous assistants?

JULIAN

Not formally.

HARRY

Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.

(then)

Honey, did you bring the CDs?

HARRY

(to Julian)

These are for you...

(to the Girls)

The man loves Hip Hop.

JULIAN

(checking out the bag)

Maybe not this much but...

HARRY

And did you bring the other thing?

HARRY

This is just to thank you for your

brilliance the other night. I hope

it suits you.

JULIAN

(opening the box)

Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the

most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.

35.

HARRY

- Oh, good. It's a Piaget.

(to Girls)

He likes it.

JULIAN

No, I love it and this is incredibly

generous of you but I can't accept it.

HARRY

You save my life and you end up

with some CDs?

JULIAN

No, I end up seeing you walk out of

here and I do get paid you know -

MARIN (O.S.)

-- Knock, knock.

hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,

JULIAN

Harry, I'll see you on the way out.

LOWELL

(whispers)

We'll pull up the car.

HARRY

So, I'm some great date, huh?

MARIN

Yeah... Mr. Excitement.

HARRY

Tell me somethin', we haven't actually

had sex yet, have we?

MARIN

No we haven't. You're correct on

that one.

HARRY

Something to live for.

36.

HARRY

Down to the cheek.

(that's big, he digests

that one)

Come on, let's get outta here.

NURSE

Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...

(she stops)

Okay, now slow-ly.

HARRY

Look at these faces. Will you tell them

I'm fine.

ERICA

Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!

JULIAN

Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the

gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

HARRY

I ain't goin' back in there.

JULIAN

You don't have to but I can't put you in

a car right now and I can't leave you in

the parking lot. I'd like you to stay

nearby for a few days and let me keep an

eye on you 'til you get your strength

back.

37.

HARRY

Doc, I'm out in the middle of the

Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?

NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

HARRY

(into phone)

Just promise me you won't make a decision until

we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.

Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...

(hangs up, then to Lowell)

Lowell, what was that?

LOWELL

(looking down at the Tray)

Your lunch.

HARRY

Somebody tell you to starve me to death?

KIM

Russell.

HARRY

(into phone)

Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.

I just got a clean bill of health.

YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,

SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?

38.

DAVE

This is the best turkey sandwich I

ever had in my life. What kind of

mustard is this?

ERICA

(not turning around)

I don't know.

DAVE

All right, don't get pissy. It's

not Dijon, right?

ERICA

Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause

this, of course, would never happen to

you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet

and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman

and Hart play.

(the phone RINGS)

And the phone does not stop.

(phone STOPS RINGING)

And it's never for me!

LOWELL

Sorry to interrupt.

ERICA

That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.

LOWELL

No, please, allow me.

ERICA

No, no, I'll take it. No problem.

ERICA

The man does not know my name and

I'm doing his dishes.

39.

LEX

Hi Erica. Um...where should I put

E

this?

RICA

Right here. I'll take it.

LEXI

And Harry has a headache. Do you

have any Tylenol?

ERICA

Tylenol yes. ..

(reaches in cabinet)

LEXI

(extends her hand to Dave)

Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second

assistant.

DAVE

Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?

ERICA

(holding the water glass)

Where should I put this? It's an

empty water glass. What are the

choices?

DAVE

(rises)

I'm gettin' outta your hair.

ERICA

Thank you.

DAVE

So you're not ready to show me any

pages? I'm not putting pressure on

you, I'm just asking.

ERICA

I haven't written a word. I'm on

page twelve and the first eleven

pages stink.

DAVE

So you have one good page.

(then)

How tall do you think that girl

was?

40.

MARIN

Dad! I didn't know you were here.

DAVE

I'm just on my way out, bubbee.

MARIN

Well, I was just gonna drive into the

city with Zoe but if you're driving back,

I'd much rather go with you.

DAVE

I have to meet someone before I go...

ERICA

(to Marin)

Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's

leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm

supposed to stay here with him alone?

MARIN

The doctor said" he's 'sending over

a Nurse in the morning...

ERICA

The morning? That's nineteen hours from

now...

(takes a deep breath)

Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going

to get into a zen' place, play music,

cook, write, focus...

DAVE

She never changes...

ERICA

(setting him straight)

Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.

HARRY (O.S.)

Smells great in here.

41.

ERICA

Coq au Vin...

(he looks confused)

H

Chicken cooked in red wine...

ARRY

French Food... French music...

ERICA

Part of my play takes place in Paris so

I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm

hopin'...How you feeling?

HARRY

Well, I walked all the way in here,

only bumping into two chairs and an

ottoman.

ERICA

Everyone bumps into that ottoman.

HARRY

Hey, thanks for letting me...

ERICA

Yeah, no...it's fine.

(answering the phone)

Hello. Yes, he is.

(hands the phone to Harry)

HARRY

(into phone)

Hello. Hey sweets...

(Erica hates this)

Oh, you got the flowers? Are they

pretty?

HARRY

Hey, can I call you in a little

bit. What's your number doll?

(spots a pad and pencil)

HARRY

(slips them on, jots down

the number)

Okay... Call you in a little.

42.

HARRY

Same prescription...

ERICA

Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch

of the imagination, I think you're all

that right for my daughter but I don't

really appreciate hearing you on the

phone with other women. It's like I'm an

accomplice to you cheating, it's...

HARRY

Your daughter knows I see other women.

ERICA

She does? I mean, fine, it's none

of my business...but...

(struggles to open a

bottle of wine)

HARRY

She knows I'm not monogamous...We've

discussed it.

ERICA

Great? And that's what? Why are you

proud of that?

HARRY

Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter

said she likes that about me.

(takes the wine and opens

it with ease.)

ERICA

My daughter is confused when it comes to men.

HARRY

I don't blame her. We're confusing.

othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt

43.

ERICA

Should I just call the ambulance now?

ERICA

What am I doing?

HARRY

(into phone)

Can you hold a see, doll?

(looks to Erica)

Hey.

ERICA

Okay, here's the thing. I really don't

want to play the part of the uptight

Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you

want to have another heart attack, go

ahead, it's your life but I have work to

do and I don't have time to make another

run to the hospital because you're

filling your already clogged arteries

with smoke but more importantly, I'd

rather not have my house smell like a

pool hall.

44.

HARRY

I have a question for you.

ERICA

What? Do I Hhave to say what?

ARRY

Have you always been like this or

do I bring this out in you?

HARRY

I don't think I've ever had this

effect on a woman before.

ERICA

(picking up the

newspapers)

And what effect do you think you're

having on me?

HARRY

I don't quite recognize it, that's how I

know I've never had it before.

HARRY

So you don't sleep?

ERICA

I only need about four hours a night.

HARRY

Me too. Never slept eight hours in my

life.

ERICA

Me either. I wish I could. ..but...

(re: curtains)

Want me to shut these, sun comes in

pretty strong in the morning.

HARRY

Sure. . . thanks. . .

ERICA

(drawing the drapes)

Who you talking to at this hour?

45.

HARRY

A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.

ERICA

And that's not past her bedtime?

HARRY

So you don't get more mellow as the hours

pass?

ERICA

(heading out)

Good night, Harry.

HARRY

Can I ask you one other thing?

(Erica turns)

What's with the turtlenecks? It's

the middle of summer.

ERICA

Now seriously, why do you care what I

wear?

HARRY

Just curious.

ERICA

I like them. I've always liked them. I'm

just a turtleneck kinda gal.

HARRY

You ever get hot?

ERICA

No.

HARRY

Never?

ERICA

Not lately.

46.

HARRY

I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

ERICA (O.S.)

What are you doing?!?

HARRY

Trying to find the kitchen!

ERICA (O.S.)

Back here???

HARRY

I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't

really see anything. Just your tits and a

little of your-

HARRY

This is gonna be murder.

NURSE

Good bye Mrs. Barry.

47.

ERICA

Good bye? You're leaving? That's

not good.

NURSE

Been fired.

ERICA

Fired?   You just started.

HARRY

Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.

ERICA

What do you mean, not needed? Of

course we need her. She's gonna

take care of you and feed you and...

HARRY

-- No, no, I'm actually feeling

pretty perky today. Making quite a

recovery. . .

(opening the screen door)

Sorry for the trouble Mrs.

Gimble... Take care, dear.

HARRY

Listen, about last night.

ERICA

Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?

(hands him some pills)

I was at the drugstore. Your

prescriptions were ready. They said take

these two with food and this one without.

HARRY

Honestly, you were in silhouette.

ERICA

I think that's talkin' about it.

HARRY

I really didn't see all that much.

48.

ERICA

(heading toward her room)

Yip. There you go.

HARRY

Okay. Won't mention it again but...

ERICA

(almost out of the room)

Goin' to work, Harry.

HARRY

(yells)

You saw my ass, you don't see me

acting nuts, wearing hats and

glasses and weird get ups...

HARRY

Yes or no. What's the deal, can I

go?

JULIAN

You still getting dizzy?

HARRY

Not as much.

JULIAN

Out of breath?

HARRY

Only sometimes.

JULIAN

(listens with stethoscope)

How's Erica treating you?

HARRY

Who?

JULIAN

(nods toward Living Room)

Erica. . .

HARRY

Her? Oh, she's a major piece of

work. The woman wears turtlenecks

in the middle of the summer.

49.

HARRY (CONT'D)

She's beyond uptight. Almost makes

her fun to be around.

JULIAN

Uptight? That's funny. I haven't

noticed that.

HARRY

Try livin' with her.

HARRY

(with secret glee)

I actually saw her naked last

night.

JULIAN

That doesn't sound so uptight.

HARRY

It was an accident. She thought I

was asleep, I thought her room was

the kitchen.

JULIAN

You know what Freud said - there

are no accidents.

HARRY

Trust me. This was an accident. Although,

why would she be walking around naked

when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

JULIAN

Why would you think her bedroom was

the kitchen?

HARRY

It was dark, it was two in the

morning.

JULIAN

That could explain why she was walking

around naked. Deep breath...

HARRY

You know I've never seen a woman

that age naked before.

JULIAN

You're kidding?

HARRY

Hey, we're not all doctors.

50.

JULIAN

Well, I think she's very beautiful

and she's a fantastic writer, you

know.

HARRY

No, I don't know...

JULIAN

Erica Barry? She's pretty major.

(writing a prescription)

So, you date her daughter?

HARRY

Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take

after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,

what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?

indicates his dick)

When can I be up and running in

that department?

JULIAN

I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay

put for another couple of weeks.

HARRY

But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

JULIAN

It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And

just so you know, I'm told after a heart

attack, if you can climb a flight of

stairs, you can have sex.

CUT TO:

51.

ERICA

So, you're saying, he's not ready

to travel at all? Not even by

plane? Train?

JULIAN

I don't think so...

(sees her disappointment)

It's been tough, huh?

ERICA

Well, he fired the Nurse after an

hour, now says he doesn't need one.

He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.

JULIAN

How are you holding up?

ERICA

Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...

JULIAN

One more fine and I won't believe you.

ERICA

Oh, shoot, hold on...

(into phone)

Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...

ERICA

(into phone)

No, I'm finally getting to it...

ULIAN

(heading out)

Pick you up around seven?

ERICA

W-What about the patient?

52.

JULIAN

Like he said, he doesn't need a

nurse.

HARRY

(yells, warning-like)

I'm Walking Around The house!

ERICA

Listen, I've decided to get over the

whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we

don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

HARRY

Good, 'cause I've been hiding from

you all day.

ERICA

I know. You want to come in?

HARRY

I don't want to break your rhythm

or anything.

ERICA

That would be wishful thinking.

HARRY

Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna

venture out there and go for a

short walk...

ERICA

You up to that?

53.

HARRY

My doctor recommended it. I gotta

build up to stairs and stuff like

that. You wouldn't want to join me?

ERICA

That means you don't want me to?

HARRY

No, I was asking if you wanted to.

ERICA

Oh, well, I would but...I don't

usually like to break once I've

started writing so I probably

shouldn't, not that a little fresh

air would hurt but...

HARRY

It's just a walk Erica, not a

marriage proposal.

ERICA

You know my name.

HARRY

Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up

on the internet.

HARRY

-- Did you know there are over eight

thousand websites that mention you?

ERICA

That can't be possible.

HARRY

No, it's true. I know everything

about you now. And not because of

last night, but...

E

RICA

Yeah, I understood. I actually

looked you up too. You grew up in

L.A., which I thought nobody did.

54.

ERICA (CONT'D)

You were the road manager for a group I

sorta never heard of, started your own

record label at 29, sold it at 45, then

started buying and selling boutique

companies then invested in a small record

company which you turned into the 2nd

largest Hip Hop label in the world.

HARRY

It's exhausting just hearing about it.

ERICA

I know, but the truth is, it goes

fast doesn't it?

HARRY

Like the blink of an eye.

HARRY

I noticed you have bowls of those

all over your house.

ERICA

I know, I'm crazy, I just think

they're so beautiful...

HARRY

But why do you only pick up the white

ones?

ERICA

I don't only pick up the white ones.

HARRY

Oh, so you really are crazy.

ERICA

I pick up only the white ones?

(looks in her hand)

Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm

controlling, unadventurous, what?

HARRY

So you're as hard on yourself as

you are on everyone else.

HARRY

Something to remember me by.

55.

ERICA

So can I ask you something Harry? What's

with all the young girls? I mean, what's

the story there, really?

HARRY

I just like to travel light.

ERICA

You just like to travel light? Oh,

please, what the hell does that mean?

HARRY

Now see a thirty year old gets that.

ERICA

You mean falls for that.

HARRY

I mean, accepts it.

ERICA

If that's what you want... a non

threatening woman, who won't get your

number, you get to run the show...

HARRY

I think our relationship is growing

by the way. Have you noticed?

HARRY

I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get

out of the house. Now, you may notice,

interestingly, we're walking back toward

the house and its getting a little rocky

again.

ERICA

Of course it's getting a little

rocky, we're talking about you.

HARRY

See, I'll accept that slight

hostility because I'm enjoying your

company so much.

hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks

ERICA

You okay?

56.

HARRY

Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and

watch the sunset. You interested?

HARRY

Big dinner date?

ERICA

Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.

With your doctor.

HARRY

Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not

too young for you, huh?

ERICA

No, he's totally too young for me.

But we're just having dinner. It's

not a date.

HARRY

Does he know that?

ERICA

Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt

that he thinks of it that way.

HARRY

I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you

may like it. Think of it this way -- he's

not threatening, won't get your number,

you get to run the show. You might have a

hell of a time.

JULIAN

Hey, look who's answering the door.

HARRY

And look who's at the door.

JULIAN

Brought you something.

57.

JULIAN

A heart healthy dinner from our

cafeteria.

ERICA (O.S.)

Hello...

JULIAN

You look beautiful.

ERICA

Thank you.

ERICA

(thrown)

We ready..?

JULIAN

Let me just see how Harry's doing.

It'll take two seconds. Har, have a

seat. .

HARRY

What? That's not the face you want

to see your doctor making.

JULIAN

Your pulse is a little fast but

maybe you're just excited about

something.

58.

HARRY

(quickly)

I don't think so. I'm not excited

about anything.

JULIAN

There it goes again. Racing.

HARRY

Doc... Impossible!

JULIAN

Oh, there we go, now I feel better.

Back to normal.

HARRY

Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't

rush back for me and don't do anything I

wouldn't do.

ERICA

Well that wouldn't leave us too

many options would it?

HARRY

And do we wonder how she writes

that snappy repartee.

(whispers to Erica)

Let him pick up the check. It'll

make him feel older.

M

ARIN (O.S.)

Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave

a message and I'll call you back.

HARRY

Hey, it's me...just sitting around

looking at your baby pictures...

Thinking about you...

59.

ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and

Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -

HARRY

Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old

old old Har...

HARRY

(complimented)

Top of the heap...

ERICA

-- So, when the land came up, I snatched it

and the house was built in record time and...

(blushing to death)

It's like a thousand degrees in here.

JULIAN

You know, they say doctors fall for

people who need rescuing, that we have a

need to take care of someone.

ERICA

Really? I never heard that one.

(starts fanning herself

with the menu)

Julian, how old are you, like...

JULIAN

-- Thirty-three.

60.

ERICA

JULIAN

ERICA

JULIAN

ERICA

J

ULIAN

ERICA

JULIAN

ERICA

JULIAN

ERICA

JULIAN

61.

ERICA

Now you're kidding, right? No, guys

my age, the ones I've met...well,

I'm not that regular a person and

they really like regular.

JULIAN

Men your age may be really stupid,

you ever think of that?

(takes her hand)

ERICA

Yes I have. Many times.

JULIAN

(looks from her hand to

her eyes)

There's something radically wrong with

the idea that no one loves you.

JULIAN

I knew you'd smell good.

ERICA

It's just...soap...

JULIAN

How much is soap that smells like this?

ERICA

I don't know. I got it at the market.

JULIAN

Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

ERICA

No, swear to God, I'm not...

62.

ERICA

(yells)

I'm back...

HARRY (O.S.)

You have fun?

ERICA

It was interesting. So... Good night.

HARRY

(yells)

'Night...

e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.

ERICA

(to herself)

How does he know everything!

63.

HARRY

We are cute...

ERICA

This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not

used to having sleepovers.

HARRY

Me either.

ERICA

Really? With your social life?

HARRY

My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.

Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

ERICA

Okay, good to know.

(heading for the kitchen)

So, what are you hungry for?

HARRY

(joining her)

What are my choices? I mean I know you

think I'm not very discriminating but...

ERICA

Oh, God, what's the difference what I

think. I can't imagine what you think of

me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au

vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

HARRY

Pancakes.

ERICA

Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?

64.

HARRY

You ever miss being married? I bet you

were great at it.

ERICA

Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not

that much anymore. Was one of us just

saying something interesting?

HARRY

You said you can't imagine what I think

of you.

ERICA

Oh, right, but you don't have to answer

that.

HARRY

Okay.

ERICA

I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be

curious but...'

HARRY

will you tell me first why you only

miss being married at night?

ERICA

(cracking eggs)

Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much

at night and the "alone" thing happens at

night and sleeping by myself took some

getting used to. But I got the hang of

it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the

bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have

a side when no one has the other side.

HARRY

Okay, now I'm convinced what I

think of you is right.

(Erica waits. . . )

You are a tower of strength.

ERICA

(shoulders sagging)

Ughhhhhhhhhh... .

HARRY

Try not to rate my answer.

ERICA

I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.

65.

HARRY

You're like a thoroughbred in a world of

mutts. No, you know what you are, you're

like a great portrait over a fireplace.

Words have been invented to describe

women like you.

ERICA

( fearful)

Such as?

HARRY

Flinty   and...Impervious.

ERICA

So you think I'm inhuman.

HARRY

No. I think you're formidable.

ERICA

But cold and distant. Like I'm

frozen in some painting...

HARRY

Not at all. I think you're strength

defines you.

(sees how sensitive she

is)

But it's thrilling when your defenses are

down arid you're not isolated. That, I

believe, is your winning combo. A killer

combo actually.

ERICA

... So I can't decide if you hate me or if

maybe you're the only person who ever got

me.

HARRY

I don't hate you.

ERICA

Hello?

MARIN

Room service!

ERICA

What are you doing here at this hour?

66.

MARIN

(enters, kisses Erica)

I

had this big photography auction

tonight, then I went out with a

bunch of people, I checked my

messages and got this so sad

message from Harry so bored out

here. I thought I should come out

and at least see how he was doing.

(kisses Harry on the

cheek)

Thank you for the gorgeous flowers

by the way. They were so huge...

MARIN

So how are you guys?

(sets down the Zabar's

bag)

Oh, this is too sweet. You're making

pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your

pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

ERICA

Don't be silly. You know I never

sleep and this one doesn't sleep

either. It's... .What's in the

bag?

MARIN

(reaches into the bag)

A quart of matzoh ball soup for

Harry. I know it's not the remedy

for heart problems but it is low

cholesterol.

ERICA

(hating to correct her)

But high sodium.

MARIN

Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your

favorite raisin-bread. And for

me...

(reaches into the bag)

My favorite Vodka.

67.

MARIN

(into phone)

Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record

time. Everyone's still there?

ERICA

So, Mar, now that you're here, why

don't you finish the pancakes and

I'll get back to work...

MARIN

Mom! I just got here, hold on.

MARIN

So your ex-husband stood me up

today. We were supposed to have

lunch at Barneys . He never showed

up. Was he always like this?

ERICA

Honey, I don't know...

MARIN

This is what happens after a couple

gets divorced, the kid inherits all

the problems. Not that I'm a kid.

(then to Harry, the flirt

in her coming back)

So how are you, how do you feel?

When can you go home?

ERICA

I really am gonna do a little work.

. . you two catch up. . . and just

flip these Hin like two seconds.

ARRY

You don't want pancakes anymore?

ERICA

I, uh, I don't think I...I...

(looks at Marin so)

gorgeous, next to him

No. I don't.

68.

MARIN

I'm breaking up with Harry.

ERICA

Why? What do you mean?

MARIN

'Cause I met someone else.

ERICA

In the two days you've been gone?

MARIN

You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a

thousand people everyday. Also, let's

face it, the guy's insanely old for me.

I'd be nuts to keep this going.

ERICA

True, but you know he is....

MARIN

-- I know. He's soulful when you

don't expect it, right?

ERICA

It's unnerving.

MARIN

Now, Mom, if you could handle this,

I was thinking... you and Harry...

ERICA

I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to

handle it.

MARIN

But you're only saying that 'cause

you think he and I have had sex.

ERICA

Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?

69.

MARIN

(whispering)

Never even got close. Swear to God.

(Erica digests this)

Just puttin' that out there...'cause for

two people who are convinced they got

life beat, there's was somethin' cooking

in the kitchen last night other than

pancakes.

ERICA (O.S.)

(into phone)

Hello.

J

ULIAN

I've waited a reasonable amount of hours

before calling you, even though you've

been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.

I'm wondering when we could have dinner

again? I have to work the next few nights

and if we wait 'til next week, I know

you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I

know it's like a date night but I think

that's good.

ERICA

Who is this?

ERICA

I'm kidding!

JULIAN

Can you meet me at The Grill at

eight?

ERICA

Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.

70.

JULIAN

I look forward to, seeing you too.

NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

MARIN

Okay, he's all yours.

ERICA

Stop that. How'd he take it?

MARIN

He just took care of it for me; He

was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate

was to be friends. ...Oh my God.

(realizes something)

He was breaking up with me. He's a

genius.

ERICA

That's impossible, he wouldn't...

MARIN

It doesn't matter, we're done and

we both feel good about it.

(hugs her)

I gotta get back.

(as she exits)

Now Erica, try to think of this as

the smartest thing you've ever done

for yourself.

ERICA

(into the phone)

Hello.

HARRY

(from the beach)

Thought you'd like to know your

daughter broke up with me.

71.

ERICA

I heard.

HARRY

Made up a story about meeting another

guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in

my arm.

ERICA

No, I think she really did meet

someone else.

HARRY

Hey, it's alright. Her mother

didn't like me anyway.

ERICA

(smiles)

How 'bout I bring you out some

lunch and a couple of blood

H

pressure pills?

ARRY

You're a great woman, Erica.

(Erica relaxes)

Is this why my doctor is falling in

love with you?

72.

ERICA

I'm sorry.

HARRY

(truly confused)

For what?

ERICA

I just kissed you.

HARRY

No, honey, I kissed you.

ERICA

I know that one was me.

HARRY

Try not to keep score.

HARRY

Soft lips...

ERICA

I'm so glad they still work.

HARRY

Well, well, now look who's got

ERICA

And you didn't even take Via-

HARRY

(puts his finger on her

lips)

Kiss me before you make it go away.

he kisses him long and sweet.

73.

HARRY

This could be world class

interesting.

(Erica nods)

Having any doubts?

ERICA

(as they kiss)

Yes.

HARRY

Me too.

ERICA

But so far the kissing is

spectacular.

(He looks at her)

I'm not grading you, just

mentioning it. Brilliant.

HARRY

Can't get past your damn

turtleneck. . .

ERICA

(breathless)

Cut it off... Please.

HARRY

You're beautiful.

HARRY

Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.

(she opens her eyes)

Beautiful...

74.

HARRY

What about birth control?

ERICA

Menopause.

HARRY

(thrilled)

Who's the lucky boy...

ERICA

I think we should take your blood

pressure.

ERICA

It's irresponsible not to.

ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

HARRY

Nobody but you would. . .

ERICA

Yeah...so you're lucky.

ERICA

(ecstatic)

One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!

75.

ERICA

Oh my God, I do like sex.

HARRY

You certainly do.

ERICA

Wow. So this is what you're supposed to

do on a rainy afternoon...

ERICA

I really thought I was sorta closed for

business. Just never expected this.

HARRY

(nods)

Nothin's ever surprised me more...

HARRY

This is crazy. I can't remember the last

time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

ERICA

(crying with him)

Me too. That's the perfect word.

HARRY

Baby, I had sex three days after a heart

attack and I didn't die!

HARRY

That's gotta be some kind of record.

ERICA

(wiping her tears)

Let's not brag about this to our

doctor, okay?

76.

HARRY

Honey I may not be many things but one -

thing I am is a gentleman.

HARRY

Erica, Erica, Erica.

(she turns to him)

You know I'm not good at being

monogamous, right?

ERICA

Monogamous? Please, I hardly know

you.

ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.

HARRY

-- So there I was at nineteen, in New

York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow

before and I didn't have enough money for

the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea

how far it was and I'm talking blizzard

and I'm in sneakers.

ERICA

Awwwww,. . .

ERICA

(disoriented)

Hello? I mean...Hello.

(turns phone upside down)

Hello.

MARIN

Mom, you guys okay out there?

ERICA

We're fine. Why? What's going on?

77.

MARIN

What do you mean, it's like a

hurricane. The news said the winds

are like a zillion miles an hour.

ERICA

Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...

MARIN

Are you having sex? Tell the truth.

You are, aren't you.

ERICA

Absolutely not. No. That is not

going on now.

MARIN

Oh my God, you already did it. Was

it amazing?

ERICA

I have to go.

MARIN

Just tell me, was it amazing?

ERICA

Yes and thank you for the wonderful

opportunity.

ERICA

(to Harry)

Am I interested in buying aluminum

siding. . .

HARRY

Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?

HARRY

--But why Paris?

ERICA

I just always wanted to write a play that

ended there.

78.

ERICA (CONT'D)

People need romance like that. And if

someone like me doesn't write it, where

they gonna get it? Real life?

HARRY

(slightly insulted)

Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating

eggs by candlelight in our robes after...

HARRY

So where do you like to eat in

Paris?    E

RICA

Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,

it's just a little bistro on the Left

Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.

HARRY

You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

ERICA

It's a great city to stay up all

night in.

(then)

When's your birthday?

HARRY

February.

ERICA

Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we

still know each other by then we go to

Paris for our birthdays.

HARRY

(a beat, then)

Maybe. . .

ERICA

Oh. Sorry. You just...

(sees the look on his

face) .

I have no idea how to do this...be

intimate but not...The color is draining

from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna

pee,take one of your blood pressure pills

then when I get back, let's not talk

anymore.

79.

HARRY

You're the funniest girl I ever had

sex with.

ERICA

That's somethin'...

HARRY

Honey... ?

HARRY

I think I'm gonna go back to my

room...let you sleep.

ERICA

Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually

send the girls home. . .but I am home...

so...okay.

HARRY

I'm an old dog, you' know.

ERICA

Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.

Good night. This was..This was a

great night. For me...

HARRY

Me too. At one point I even thought

soul mates, you know...

HARRY

I'd like to try sleeping with you.

80.

FADE THRU TO:

arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms

HARRY

(grabs his watch, blinks)

Can you see this?

ERICA

Not really but it looks like it

says eleven.

HARRY

(slips on his glasses)

It is eleven...

ERICA

It can't be, that would mean we

slept eight hours.

HARRY

Impossible.

HARRY

How ya doin' Ace?

(she ,elts as he lies

right back down)

Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.

ERICA

Okay, just stay still, here's the

clicker. You know you have a

doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.

(getting out of bed)

(MORE )

81.

ERICA (CONT'D)

I'll make us some coffee, get you your

pills, whip us up some french toast, I

have ,the best maple syrup ever. '

HARRY

Erica...

(she turns)

You are a woman to love.

ERICA

You are woman to love. What the

hell does that mean?

JULIAN

Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These

past few days have done wonders for you.

HARRY

Yeah, I've been working on that stair

thing. I can do it by the way.

J

ULIAN

Do what?

HARRY

(quickly)

Climb a flight of stairs. Several times

actually.

JULIAN

Way to go. How's Erica?

HARRY

(caught)

Erica?

JULIAN

I know you must know her name by

now.

82.

HARRY

Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out

is an amazing woman. Does whatever

she can to make me happy. Really.

Turns out she's very giving.

HARRY

Very giving.

JULIAN

(looking away)

Yeah, well that's wonderful. I

think she's wonderful.

HARRY

I think she's wonderful too.

JULIAN

(gathering his things)

Give her my best...

HARRY

Julian. Thanks for everything.

JULIAN

You're gonna be okay.

HARRY

(touching his tears)

What the...? This is the second

time I've done this now. I get

overcome or something. . .

JULIAN

It's very common to become emotional

after having an episode like you've had.

Everything takes on a new meaning.

HARRY

(wiping his tears)

So it's not crazy for a man to do

something entirely out of character

after having a heart attack?

JULIAN

(handing him Kleenex)

Like crying?

83.

HARRY

Yeah and totally changing their

tastes. Like suddenly really liking

something they never thought they

could like...ever...and I'm talking

really liking it. It's...unnerving.

JULIAN

I think you can expect just about

anything right now. People have done some

wild things after having a heart

attack...selling businesses, getting

divorced, moving... Some people say it

saved their lives.

HARRY

But most people go back to being

themselves, right? I'll go back to

being me, won't I?

J

ULIAN

We'll see.

HARRY

(on his cell)

Hi.

ERICA

Hey.    What'd he say?

HARRY

He said you're wonderful.

ERICA

No, really, what'd he say...How are you?

HARRY

He said I'm good..that I can go.

. ERICA

(obviously conflicted)

Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.

. . great.

HARRY

Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute

sure. You think you can deal with me for

one more night?

84.

HARRY

(big breath)

Okay, here goes...

ERICA

Here goes what?

HARRY

Here goes me singing to you...

(pulling a DISC out of his

pocket)

Bought my own music.

ERICA

You knew they had karaoke?

HARRY

Baby, it's why we're here. .

HARRY

This is for you, Ace...

(then, under his breath)

wish me luck.

HARRY

(sings)

I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To

Give your heart a song to sing... And

then a kiss, but more than this... I wish

arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

HARRY

Don't want to blow this part...

85.

HARRY

(sings)

Et en juillet une limonade...Pour

vous refroidir dans quelque lefy

glade...

CUT TO:

ERICA

(holding some cigars)

Here you go, you can have these back now.

(Harry looks confused)

I confiscated them your first night

here...

HARRY

(smells them)

Thank you darlin' ...

ERICA

Try not to smoke them...

(hands him a small bag)

And I packed you a sandwich, just

in case your blood sugar got low.

And some of that iced-tea you like,

and a nonfat, low cholesterol

cookie. And a peach.

HARRY

what a doll...

(notices)

Got something else?

ERICA

Something to remember me by.

86.

HARRY

There is that...

ERICA

And hey, we'll always have Paris.

HARRY

Honey, no words can ever express my

gratitude for taking me in and taking care

of me and...

ERICA

Hey, your heart attack could be the best

thing that ever happened to me.

HARRY

(kisses her quickly, even

faster throws out)

I love ya.

ERICA

I love you too...if that's what you said. I

don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an

official I love you but...

HARRY

You're not like anybody.

ERICA

Neither are you.

E

RICA

I knew you'd call.

87.

MARIN

Who? It's me.

ERICA

What's wrong?

MARIN

I had breakfast with Dad this morning and

we're talking and he starts looking all

weir~ and then he tells me he met someone

three weeks ago and it's "really

something and then he

(sobbing now)

He tells me he's getting married. Why am

I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty

years old...

(people stare at her)

Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.

ERICA

Who's he marrying?

MARIN

I don't know. Some chick he met three

weeks ago. She's four years older than me

and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.

Has he lost his mind? I have a huge

auction tonight... Why do I have to be

the one to deal with this? Can you please

come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~

away for two weeks...I know you're

working but. . .please. . ?

88.

ERICA

Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll

let Harry know I'll be. in the    city

tonight and he can reach me on    my

cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit.

Hello?

MARIN

-- Look, I get that he has a right to get

remarried, but he doesn't even know her

and she's like my age. You know what

that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And

I know he's not replacing me so why does

it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?

Crying like this...

(

lights a cigarette)

ERICA

Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.

And all the statistics say divorced men

almost always remarry. That's just the

way they're built.

MARIN

(slipping on her dress)

Mom, you want to know the answer to

the big mystery of my life? Why I'm

always with the wrong guy? This is

why. Because the wrong guy can't do

this to you. You have some control

with the wrong guy. This thing I'm

feeling right now. This is my big

fear...that some guy could get me

unglued like this, like nothing's

connected. And this is just my

father! I'm just not strong enough

to handle this kind of drama.

ERICA

The drama in life is what makes you

strong.

MARIN

No, it's what makes you strong.

You've never really understood

this,but we're not all like you.

89.

MARIN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex

husband, the man who I still allow to

direct my plays.! was getting married to

some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat

Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.

(realizes)

You've never looked better, by the way.

(sinks)

My anti-depressant is obviously not

working. It should cover events like this

shouldn't it?

ERICA

Since when do you take an antidepressant?

MARIN

Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who

doesn't?

ERICA

Yes. Me.

MARIN

I rest my case.

VOICE FROM OUTSIDE

Marin, we're all set.

MARIN

Mom, can you do one other really

big thing for me? Just say yes.

ERICA

(taking two Turns)

Anything bubee.

MARIN

Will you come out to dinner tonight

with me and Dad and the fiance?

ERICA

Absolutely not. No.

MARIN

Please. He wants me to meet her and I can

not go alone. I already asked him if you

could come and he said it was fine and

she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna

have to meet her too, so, we might as

well meet her together. Come on, you know

you can handle it.

90.

about it. She knows she can too.

ARIN

Okay. That's it. See that look on

your face. That's the gene I didn't

get.

MARIN

Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and

this evening's sale of Impressionistic

and Modern Art. Bidders should know that

the auctioneer may open bidding on any

lot below the reserve by placing a bid on

behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start

with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And

$5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is

bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000

gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on

the phone. . .

JULIAN

Guess I got stood up.

WAITER

Would you like to order or...?

91.

JULIAN

Why not, I put. on the tie and

everything. And can you bring me

another. . .

(indicating his drink)

AVE

(to Erica)

Thirsty?

ERICA

I've had a big week Dave, forgot how

these slip right down. I'm fine. So,

Kristen, where'd you go to...

(burps)

--medical school? Excuse me.

KRISTEN

University of Pennsylvania.

ERICA

I went to school in Philadelphia

too.

DAVE

Bryn Mawr girl.

KRISTEN

That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn

Mawr . . .

MARIN

Wow. So not only are you marrying my father

but our mothers went to the same college.

MARIN

Anyone mind?

KRISTEN

Actually I do.

What? It's not true? The man can not

watch TV or read without the hand down

the pants-- Here's my advice after 21

years I say who cares, they're his

balls,let him enjoy 'em.

MARIN

(chokes)

I think I swallowed my olive, whole.

OVING IN ON ERICA

MARIN

Mom, you okay?

ERICA

Yeah, fine.

RICA

You know what? Maybe I need a little

air...

HARRY

Hey.

ERICA

Hello... Harry.

(to his Date)

Hello...

94.

ERICA

Oh, God, I'm so stupid...

ERICA

Hello?

HARRY

(walking quickly)

Slow down. You want to kill me?

ERICA

Harry, I gotta go...

HARRY

Erica, she's just a friend.

ERICA

Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind

of a girl.

HARRY

Come on, it's just a dinner...

ERICA

Look, Harry, here's the problem. I

really like you.

HARRY

I really like you.

ERICA

Yeah, but I love you like you.

(that stops him)

I do. I love you.

HARRY

I think maybe you should consider

that you're in love with the idea

of being in love.

95.

ERICA

o you? Okay. Oh, God...

(stomps her feet)

(tries not to cry in front

of him)

(pointing to herself)

HARRY

ERICA

HARRY

97.

ERICA

That's a horrible thing to say.

(walks off, comes back)

The life I had before I met you. I

knew how to do that, could do that

forever. Now look at me...what do I

do with all this?

HARRY

Can we talk tomorrow?

ERICA

What for? I saw your friend you were

having dinner with, if that's what you

want, it's never going to work with me.

Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,

don't let this brown hair fool you, I

don't have a real brown hair on my head,

I'm almost all grey...that would freak

you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high

cholesterol and my back hurts every

morning and I'm post menopausal and I

have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis

is just around the corner and I know

you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face

it man, that's not quite the buzz you're

lookin' for.

ERICA

And you know what? Everyday, I'm

gettin' older. ..just like you.

HARRY

Wait.

HARRY

I just... the truth is... I don't

know how to be a boyfriend.

ERICA

That's what you have to say after all

this? You don't know how to be a

boyfriend.

HARRY

That's not a small thing.

98.

ERICA

Are we done?

HARRY

I don't know.

HARRY

(winces)

Ouch.

HARRY

Oh, God...

NURSE

Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest

pain, no nauseau, some shortness of

breath, was hospitalized a week ago

with a coronary thrombosis.

DR. MARTINEZ

Hang a nitro drip.

HARRY

You can't. I took Viagra.

DR. MARTIINEZ

You have been through this before.

Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You

h~ving chest pain right now?

H

ARRY

No, and the pain I was having was

sharp, not like before.

. DR. MARTINEZ

That's good. Not like before is we

like to hear.

(reads EKG)

Give him aspirin.

99.

DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)

Based   on what I see so far, your

heart   is not in distress but I'm

gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be

sure.    What were you doing at the

onset   of the pain?

HARRY

Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can

a woman give you chest pain?

DR. MARTINEZ

Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you

heard?

HARRY

Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I

never got any.

DR. MARTINEZ

(confused at how literal

he is)

All right, well you're battin' a thousand

here. Your enzymes look perfect, your

EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound

like the kind of pain we worry about. I

think what you experienced was normal

chest pain associated with stress.

HARRY

Stress?

DR. MARTINEZ

And incase you haven't heard, that can

give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I

donlt know what you're up to gallivanting

out and about at this hour, but if you

were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,

in bed, recuperating.

HARRY

If you were my Dad...

100.

ERICA'S VOICE

Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so

leave a message.

HARRY

(grabbing his chest)

Ouch.

ULIAN'S VOICE

Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about

8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just

Wondering if you're...

101.

e writes:How's the writing going?

rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.

HARRY

Lowell, I'm goin' out.

LOWELL

(confused)

Okay. Don't forget to put some

clothes on.

HARRY

I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?

Since .when don't I go out? Just cause

some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to

stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn

into a monk.

102.

LOWELL

Is there something you'd like me to

do for you, Mr. Langer?

HARRY

Well, no, just...well, what are you

doin'?

LOWELL

Watching Lucy.

HARRY

Would you hate making me something

to eat?

HARRY

Funny women are adorable, don't you

think?

LOWELL

I never really thought about it.

HARRY

Neither had I, but think about it.

Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's

fun to be around.

LOWELL

There's some reason we've been

watching these two for 5O years.

HARRY

Exactly. It lasts. We're not

sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van

Doren reruns.

LOWELL

No we're not. You feeling okay?

HARRY

I don't think I've slept one night

since I've been home. Every little

ache and pain scares the shitout of

me...can't get a handle on my

emotional life, don't know what I

want, don't know if what I felt was

because I just had a heart attack

or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I

never used that word in my life.

103.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Lowell, have you ever seen me like

this? Be honest.

LOWELL

Nothing even close.

HARRY

That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.

And I'm no good at it.

(realizes something)

Those are very nice pajamas, by the

way. Did they used to be mine?

LOWELL

Yes but you gave them to me, you

said you never wore them.

HARRY

I know. But why would I do that?

They're so elegant. Nice piping...

LOWELL

Mr. Langer, you're always giving

away beautiful things.

HARRY

Awwwww... How did I get like this?

(eyes fluttering shut)

I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few

minutes. Keep Lucy on...

MARIN

Mom, we're going into town...

her)

MARIN

105.

ERICA

No. This was bad. But for the three days

it was good, it was electrifying.

ERICA

I think you must consider the possibility

that we are more alike than you realize.

I let someone in and I had the time of my

life.

MARIN

(tearful)

I've never had the time of my life.

ERICA

I know. And bubbee, I say this from

the deepest part of my heart. . ...

what the fuck are you waiting "for?

LOWELL

(as Harry passes)

H

aving fun?

HARRY

Not quite.

ZOE

I got you something great at the

farm stand.

106.

JULIAN

These are for you to give me when

you apologize.

ERICA

Julian, I hope you know I'm

mortified by my behavior. I was

going to get in touch with you,

send you a note or something...

JULIAN

A note? That's a little chilly.

ERICA

I'm embarrassed. I just haven't

been myself lately. What can I say?

JULIAN

Just tell me you're sorry.

ERICA

I am sorry.

JULIAN

Then you could kiss me.

ERICA

Kiss you?

ulian nods.

ERICA

You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?

JULIAN

Think so.

107.

JULIAN

No one on earth would forgive you

for that kiss

(places his wine glass on

the counter)

May I?

JULIAN

(still holding her,

whispers)

I forgive you.

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIAN

It's the best thing you've ever written.

ERICA

It is?

JULIAN

It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.

It's funny.

JULIAN

How great is it that I'm not

intimidated by your brilliance?

108.

JULIAN

Must we go through this every time?

Come here...

CUT TO:

PRETTY GIRL

I'm totally excited about this audition.

It's such a great part. It's supporting

but she's a really funny character.

There's this totally hilarious scene

where she's dating this like chauvinist

older guy and just as they're about to do

it, the guy moans and she thinks he's

just really into her, right? Except he's

having a heart attack and she's like

creeped out and her mother, who basically

despises the guy, rushes in, gives him

CPR and saves his life.

A

CTRESS

Look, we're four sophisticated people.

Why can't we all stay for the weekend?

HARRY

I need to talk to you.

HARRY

Got a minute?

109.

HARRY

So your play's about us?

ERICA

No, it's about me.

HARRY

Am I in it?

ERICA

A guy like you is in it but he's

not you.

HARRY

What happens to this guy who's

..not me?

ERICA

Haven't totally decided. He can

live or he can die.

HARRY

What are you leaning towards?

ERICA

Death.

(Harry reacts)

It's funnier.

HARRY

He dies of a funny heart attack?

ERICA

He's sort of a schmuck who screwed

around with our heroine, so it

won't be too sad.

HARRY

Schmucks are people too you know. Death

doesn't seem a little harsh?

ERICA

I just went where the story took

me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.

Really...just stuff I made up.

STAGE MANAGER

(approaching)

Erica, we're ready to do the

hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra

scene... Should we wait for you?

110.

HARRY

So I'm going to be the laughing stock of

Broadway.

ERICA

Harry, he's not you. He's a version

of the truth of you. So to speak.

STAGE MANAGER

Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants

to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",

you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',

right?

ERICA

Right.

E

RICA

Well, you look really nice. You

feeling all right?

HARRY

You know it isn't like I wanted to stop

seeing you. We could've carried on a fun

thing for awhile. Why is it you dames

want all or nothing?

ERICA

I don't know, we're just goofy when it

comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all

right with you, I'd like to be friends

HARRY

I'm not ready to be your friend. How's

that?

ERICA

Fine. I understand.

HARRY

Anyway, do you actually buy that horse

shit.. .that men and women can be friends

once they've had sex?

111.

ERICA

HARRY

ERICA

HARRY

(laughs)

ERICA

HARRY

(tries to calm down)

(realizes)

ERICA

HARRY

ERICA

HARRY

112.

HARRY(cont'd)

Sometimes worrying about you feels like a

full time job.

ERICA

Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't

have to work that shift anymore.

STAGE MANAGER

Erica, they want you to take a look at

the costumes for the dancing Henry's.

These gonna work for you?

to

ARRY

God is a woman, I know that now. No

man would punish me like this.

WOMAN JOGGER

You never change, do you?

HARRY

Do you know me or are you just talking to

me as "man" in general, the beast women

love to hate.

WOMAN JOGGER

No, no, I know you Harry.

HARRY

Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.

(the Woman laughs)

Right? I broke her heart then she married

some hard working Joe on the rebound, has

three great kids. What is so funny?

113.

WOMAN JOGGER

You dated me and you broke my heart but

after you I met the right guy. I've been

married thirty-seven years, have four

kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the

way.

HARRY

I dated you. .?

(the Woman nods)

Did we. ever...?

WOMAN JOGGER

No...we did not.

HARRY

Can you give me hint? A year? A

decade?

WOMAN JOGGER

The sixties.

(Harry squints at her)

You took me to Shea Stadium.

HARRY

To a Mets game?    I must've really

liked you.

WOMAN JOGGER

You took me to see The Beatles.

HARRY

Oh, God, I really liked you. You're

Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The

Beatles together. How the hell have

you been? What happened to you?

SANDRA

Well, let's see, after we stopped

going out, I went back to school,

got my doctorate in marine biology,

went around the world a few times,

met the man of my dreams at Oxford,

married him, we lived in London for

25 years. I wrote and taught, we

raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've

just finished my ninth book and now

I'm training for my first marathon.

Now, I must confess, I actually

remember the very last thing you

ever said to me.

114.

SANDRA(cont'd)

You walked me to my door, I was

tearful and you looked at me with

those puppy dog eyes and said,

"Honey, I just don't know how to be

a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what

have you been up to since 1964?

DR. MARTINEZ

Mr. Langer... Back so soon.

HARRY

This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20

minutes of severe chest pain,

nausea, shortness of breath, blood

pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.

(sticks out his arm)

Give me the nitrate, I didn't take

viagra.

(rips open his shirt)

Plug me in to the EKG, I need an

aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta

blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,

Procardia and if I were you, I'd be

pounding my chest. Ow!

MALE NURSE

You're a doctor, huh?

HARRY

Just a very sick man.

DR. MARTINEZ

Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although

fascinating, was entirely

incorrect.

HARRY

That's impossible.

DR. MARTINEZ

Your realize a severe anxiety attack can

masquerade as a heart attack.

HARRY

So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing

I'm not taking pills for.

115.

DR. MARTINEZ

If you don't want ,to end up in here

every week, I suggest you do whatever it

takes to decompress. Try something with

me, okay?

(takes his pulse)

Close your eyes...now give yourself a

visual image of something that gives you

a feeling of peace and serenity.

HARRY

I don't know. A hammock...

DR. MATINEZ

Okay, good...what else..?

HARRY

Palm trees...clear blue water...

DR. MARTINEZ

Anybody there with you?

HARRY

Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...

DR. MARTINEZ

(disgusted) Okay. What else do you

see, feel, taste...

HARRY

A margarita...a Cuban cigar.

..miles of soft beach.. .

DR. MARTINEZ

Keep going...you're doing great...

DISSOLVE TO:

SIX MONTHS LATER

AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,

116.

MARIN

I couldn't believe you were calling from

downstairs.

(hugs him)

So great to see you.

HARRY

You couldn't look better.

MARIN

Thank you. Come on in.

HARRY

No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say

hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did

anything to you that wasn't on the up and

up or...

MARIN

What do you mean? You were great to me.

HARRY

I was?

MARIN

Always.

HARRY

That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't

know what you've done to yourself but you

look absolutely radiant.

MARIN

I'm three months pregnant, that might

have something to do with it.

117.

HARRY,

Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?

MARIN

My husband, hold on, he really wants to

meet you.

(calls)

Danny...

MARIN

Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.

DANNY

(shaking Harry's hand)

I've heard so much about you...

HARRY

I bet.. .

DANNY

Yeah, with Hthe play and all...

ARRY

I'm famous,huh?

MARIN

Just to us. In every interview my

Mom does, she always says she made

you up.

HARRY

So the guy in the play, he doesn't

make it, does he?

DANNY

He basically dies at the end of the

second act, but it's very funny.

(as if that's some

consolation)

HARRY

Was hopin' she'd give me a

reprieve, but...

MARIN

Yeah, well...

HARRY

Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...

118.

HARRY

How is she?

MARIN

She's. . .

(Harry waits)

Really good.     Up to her old

tricks.

HARRY

Now if I wanted to see her...how

would that go over?

MARIN

(encouragingly)

Only one way to find out, except

she's out of town right now.

HARRY

Oh yeah? Where is she?

MARIN

Paris. She left two days ago, for

her birthday. But she'll be back

next week...

HARRY

Paris...

HARRY

Showtirne.

119.

HARRY

(proud of himself)

I knew you'd be here.

ERICA

You did?

HARRY

I've come a long way to see you,

Erica.

ERICA

You mean we're not bumping into

each other..? You came here to see

me?

HARRY

Yes, I did.

(she seems to shiver)

I'm aware it was a bold move, one

of those impulses that grabs you,'

but...so far, we're okay; right?

ERICA

Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...

HARRY

I'll take that as a 'Yes'.

ERICA

You want a glass of wine or

something?

HARRY

I was just gonna give you a kiss

hello.

ERICA

Oh, Okay.

HARRY

I remember you said if we still

know each other we should go to

Paris for our birthdays, well, we

still know each other..".

ERICA

That's true, but, Harry, I haven't

heard from you in six months.

120.

HARRY

I know but I've certainly been thinking

about you. There's a lot I have to say.

First thing is... I'm not mad at you

anymore.

ERICA

Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you

anymore either.

HARRY

That's a relief...since I did come all

the way to France and everything. And...

Happy Birthday.

ERICA

(afraid of everything he

could possibly say)

Thank you.

HARRY

And congratulations on your amazing

success...

ERICA

It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought

maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.

Where've you been?

HARRY

After I saw you in the theater that

afternoon, I had another "episode...

ERICA

Oh, I'm sorry.

HARRY

I was actually okay, but I was sure I was

dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed

to decompress. So I did. I walked out of

there and changed my life, sold most of my

businesses, packed my bags and moved to an

island in the Caribbean.

E

RICA

That's where you've been all this

time? In the Caribbean?

HARRY

Actually...No.

121.

,

HARRY (V.O.

I was there about ,six hours, when it

occurred to me that wasting away on an

island in the Caribbean wasn't going to

remotely cure what was ailing me.

HARRY (V.O.)

So I decided to take another kind of

pilgrimage...into my past.

HARRY (V.O.)

My thought was -- if I retraced my steps

and visited all the women I've dated...

BACK IN PARIS

HARRY

-- maybe I could figure out how I

got so screwed up.

HARRY (V.O.)

A lot of the women wouldn't see me.

HARRY (V.O.)

Or speak to me.

HARRY (V.O.)

But I was on a mission to save my

soul.

,

122.

HARRY (V.O.)

My losing streak finally ended when

I got one to open up to me.

HARRY (V.O.)

Hearing what they had to say was no

picnic.

H

ARRY (V .O.)

But I stuck it out and I listened.

Then I listened harder.

HARRY (V. O. )

And one of the things I realized

was, I was actually giving closure

to generations of women.

HARRY (V. O. )

Although I admit, some refused to

give, no matter what I did. . .

123.

HARRY (V. O. )

When you hear the same story about

yourself over and over, your life

begins to make sense and the future

becomes your only salvation.

HARRY

It took me six months to find them

all. I visited 18 different states

but I came the furthest to see you.

A MAN'S VOICE

I don't believe it.

HARRY

Me either.

ERICA

I should have told you he was coming, but

I was so engrossed in your story.

JULIAN

What story..?

HARRY

Oh, maybe another time. ..So...

(looks from Erica to

Julian, it all dawns on

him)

I guess I should've seen your play, then

I would've Jknown how this ended.

ULIAN

Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are

you doing over here, man?

HARRY

Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris

in January...

JULIAN

It's amazing to run into you. You look

wonderful.

124.

ERICA

You do.

HARRY

Haven't been on a gurney in six months so

that's somethin'...

JULIAN

Well, I've just been to every store

in the city, this woman is

impossible to buy for... But I

think I finally found the right

gift.

JULIAN

Happy Birthday baby.

ERICA

(reaching for it)

I'll open it later...

HARRY

No, no, you know what, I'll let you

two celebrate...

ERICA

Harry, stay.

HARRY

I can't really.

JULIAN

Why? You have somewhere to go?

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIAN

-- To the forces of destiny that

brought us together tonight.

125.

JULIAN

What are you doing, you don't

smoke?

ERICA

I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke

will kill you anyway...

JULIAN

She's very brilliant, but the woman

can not hold her liquor.

ERICA

I like that about me.

BOTH GUYS

Me too.

ERICA

Now, if I were writing this, this

is where I'd write, 'an awkward

moment' .

HARRY

Honey, if you were writing this,

I'd be dead.

HARRY

Never fails to amuse her.

JULIAN

No, Harry, please, let us...

HARRY

No, no, I insist. I crashed your

party.

(to Erica)

At least let me buy you dinner on

your birthday...

(squints at his watch

shows it to Erica)

What time does that say?

ERICA

(squints)

I have no idea...

126.

HARRY

(feels around)

Wait,' I have my. . .

ERICA

(reaching into her purse)

Me too...

HARRY

You think you look so handsome in

mine?

ERICA

You know how long I've been looking

for those?

HARRY

Yes I do.

H

ARRY

(tucking away his glasses)

Once again...closure.

(reads his watch)

So it's only 5 in the afternoon in

New York. What do they do around

here for fun?

BOTH GUYS

(at the same time)

Want to dance?

127.

HARRY

(laughs at himself)

At the end of the day, I'm nothin'

but a sap, a stupid old sap,

standing on a bridge in Paris,

crying my eyes out.

HARRY

(almost amused)

Look who gets to be the girl.

HARRY

(looking toward heaven)

Anything else... .

ERICA'S VOICE

Harry?

HARRY

Where's Julian?

ERICA

He went back to the hotel.

HARRY

How come?

128.

ERICA

(walking to him)

He said when he saw me with you, he

knew I was still in love with you.

What do you have to say about that?

HARRY

If it's true, my life just got

made.

ERICA

Why'd you come here, Harry?

HARRY

Because I realized what I was feeling for

you, have always felt for you, was

something I didn't understand, like a

language I didn't speak...

(she listens...)

It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck

away. Turns out the heart attack was easy

to get over. You were somethin' else.

(she's starting to melt)

And when I went to see all those women, I

found out I was never really present for

any of them. And something inside me at

some point, had just...shut off. That's

when I think my heart gave out and you

saved me. I finally get what it's all

about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love

for the first time in my life. And that's

what I came here to say.

ERICA

Okay, this is the best birthday ever.

HARRY

I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I

only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.

But how 'bout we figure out a way to make

this work.

ERICA

Okay.

HARRY

Okay? Okay! I'll take it.

HARRY

Honey, they're playing our song.

129.

FADE OUT:

half.
