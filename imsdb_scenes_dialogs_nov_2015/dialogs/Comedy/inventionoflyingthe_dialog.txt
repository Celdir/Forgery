CHIEF CAVEMAN

(grunting; subtitled)

Me see beast today. Beast scary.

Beast danger for caveman.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

If caveman kill beast? Caveman

safe. Caveman have food.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Who kill beast?

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Grob kill beast. Good Grob.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser want kill beast?

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser kill nothing!

2.

CAVEMAN #1

Look at Loser cave! So small!

CAVEMAN #2

Loser dumb!

CAVEMAN #3

Fuck that guy!

CHIEF CAVEMAN

The beast! It dead!

3.

CAVEMAN #2

Hey, look at loser! He almost die!

Look he scared!

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser, what happen?

LOSER CAVEMAN

(SHAMEFULLY)

The Beast, it came at me. It smash

my cave.

LOSER CAVEMAN

Hold on one minute!

LOSER CAVEMAN

Loser wasn't finished.

LOSER CAVEMAN

After beast smash cave, Loser look

at beast and say, "not on Loser's

watch." Loser grab rock on ground,

lift above head and smash it

down... right onto motherfucker's

head.

4.

LOSER CAVEMAN

Loser kill beast.

(PAUSE)

Now fuck off, Loser going back to

sleep.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser kill beast! Loser caveman

hero!

NARRATOR

The world's first lie. A monumental

occasion in the history of mankind.

(PAUSE)

That lowly caveman who stumbled

upon the ability to lie went on to

become chief of his village,

married dozens of cavewomen, and

passed on the lying gene to

hundreds of newborn cave-children.

(PAUSE)

Over time lying spread throughout

the world, sparking the eventual

birth of imagination itself, story-

telling, religion, and the oh-so-

important polite lie, as in, "Oh

Patty, have you lost weight? You

look fantastic."

(PAUSE)

The world would be a very different

place if events had gone otherwise

on that prolific, Paleolithic eve.

If not for that night, man would

have never acquired the ability to

lie to himself and to others.

(PAUSE)

A world without lying would be a

world without dreams. A world

without pretense. A world without

fiction. A world without flattery.

A world very unlike our own.

5.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser, what happen?

LOSER CAVEMAN

(SHAMEFULLY)

The Beast, it came at me. It smash

my cave.

LOSER CAVEMAN

Rock fall on beast. Loser do

nothing. I think Loser even soil

bear pants.

(pause; sniffing)

Loser smell bad.

CHIEF CAVEMAN

Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman,

throw rocks at loser!

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP:

JENNIFER

Hi. You're early. I was just

masturbating.

MARK

That makes me think of your vagina.

I'm Mark, how are you?

JENNIFER

A little frustrated at the moment.

Also equally depressed and

pessimistic about our date tonight.

I'm Jennifer.

MARK

I hope this date ends in sex.

JENNIFER

Not me. I don't find you

attractive. Come on in.

JENNIFER

I need to finish getting ready.

While doing that I might realize

I'm still horny and try to finish

masturbating without you hearing.

MARK

(shouting to her)

I feel awkward and I regret being

early.

7.

JENNIFER (O.S.)

(shouting back)

Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early

and not really looking forward to

tonight in general, but the thought

of being alone the rest of my life

scares both my mother and I

equally.

MARK

(shouting to her)

I have an erection now because I

assume you began masturbating once

we stopped talking.

MARK

(shouting to her)

I'm embarrassed because I think the

restaurant I've made reservations

at might not be expensive enough or

hip enough to impress you, but it

was the best I could do because I

don't make very much money. You

see, I'm forty years old and have

no real financial assets to speak

of, I've never owned a home, and

never had a significant

relationship. My boss even told me

today that I'm most likely going to

get fired tomorrow and...

JENNIFER

I just masturbated.

MARK

That makes me very horny.

JENNIFER

Shall we go?

MARK

Sure.

8.

JENNIFER

After you.

JENNIFER

I'm only doing this as a favor for

my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me

to go out on a date with you. He

says you're funny.

MARK

Greg's a good friend.

JENNIFER

Where are we eating tonight?

MARK

A cute little place called La

Bonisera in West Hollywood.

JENNIFER

You obviously don't have very much

money but that's not necessarily a

deal breaker.

MARK

I have very little money.

JENNIFER

I also don't really care about a

guy who knows all the latest,

hippest restaurants.

MARK

I don't know any of them.

JENNIFER

In fact, there are very few things

in life that I care about all that

much. The only things I have to

offer myself or anyone else are my

good looks and my affected sense of

quirkiness which artistically

inclined men interpret as

intellect.

(MORE)

9.

JENNIFER (cont'd)

In fact, I think my best trait is

the fact that I've made very few

mistakes: socially, academically,

financially or romantically. I take

very few risks and therefore lead a

relatively happy and light-hearted

existence. Mostly though, I'm a

kind, sweet person with the

potential of genuinely becoming a

vital and interesting human being

the day I take the energy I expend

on hyper self-reflexivity and apply

it to actual action in the reality

of my life.

MARK

I found that boring and started

thinking about this place's fish

tacos.

VALET PARKING GUY

I'm extremely bored.

JENNIFER

Hello.

JENNIFER

This isn't as nice as I remember

it.

MARK

What are we going to talk about?

HOSTESS

(to Jennifer)

I'm threatened by you.

MARK

Two, please.

10.

HOSTESS

Of course, come with me.

WAITER

I'm very embarrassed that I work

here. Hi.

MARK

Hello.

JENNIFER

Hello.

WAITER

(to Jennifer)

And you're pretty and that only

makes me feel worse. Can I get you

two started on some drinks?

MARK

I'll have a Budweiser.

JENNIFER

I'll start with your Mango

Margarita and probably have three

more drinks by the end of the

night.

WAITER

Excellent.

(to Mark)

She's out of your league.

MARK

Yup.

WOMAN

(SCREAMING)

All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY

angry!

11.

MARK

I'm going to ask you some questions

about your life because that's what

you do, but I'll only really listen

to about half of what you're

saying.

MARK

How do you spend your days?

JENNIFER

I get up at eight in the morning

because the noise from my alarm

clock interrupts my sleep, so I

lean over and...

MARK

That's a little more specific than

I expected.

JENNIFER

Well what did you want to know?

MARK

Do you have a job?

JENNIFER

Yes.

MARK

What job do you have?

JENNIFER

I have a job at an office.

MARK

What do you do?

JENNIFER

Just typing and filing and stuff.

MARK

Do you enjoy it?

JENNIFER

No. But I enjoy the end result of

the job which is money. And the

hours are pretty good for the

amount of money I make, which I

spend on things I like, such as

clothes, hiking, drinking -- even

though I know it's bad for me.

(MORE)

12.

JENNIFER (cont'd)

(PAUSE)

But I'd rather just get all the

money and not work for the results.

MARK

Sure. Tell me more. I'm trying to

get a little insight into you.

JENNIFER

Well you already know a lot about

me. You know I'm good looking

because... well... here I am. You

know I'm successful because you've

seen my apartment and the clothes

I'm wearing. And you know I'm happy

because I'm smiling.

MARK

Are you always happy?

JENNIFER

Usually. Some days I stay in bed

eating and crying.

MARK

Sure.

WAITER

(hands beer to Mark)

Here you go.

(hands drink to Jennifer)

I had a sip of this.

JENNIFER

Okay.

WAITER

Do you guys know what you want or

do you need a moment?

MARK

I'm ready.

JENNIFER

I'll have a caesar salad with

chicken because I think I'm fat but

I also think I deserve something

that tastes good.

13.

MARK

I'll have the fish taco's because I

had them once here and it's all I

know.

WAITER

Excellent, I'll get those both

started for you.

JENNIFER

Sorry, one second.

JENNIFER

It's my mother, this won't take

long. Probably checking in on our

date.

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)

Hello? Yes, I'm with him right now.

No, not very attractive. No,

doesn't make much money. He's all

right though. Seems nice. Kind of

funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub

nose. No, I won't be sleeping with

him tonight. Nope, probably not

even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye.

JENNIFER

Sorry about that.

MARK

Don't think twice. How is your mom?

JENNIFER

She's all right.

MARK

Fantastic.

14.

WAITER

(to Jennifer)

If I give you my number will you

call me?

JENNIFER

No.

MARK

Thanks for going on this date with

me. You're way, way out of my

league and I know you were just

doing it as a favor to Greg, and

that most likely I'll never hear

from you again.

JENNIFER

I actually had a better time than I

thought I'd have, but I won't know

for sure how I feel about you until

I'm less drunk.

MARK

Give me a call if you still like me

once you're sober.

JENNIFER

I might.

MARK

Thanks for kissing me on the cheek,

I know you didn't have to do that

and....

MARK

(shouting after her)

... you're very pretty. Thank you!

15.

JIM

Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the

spokesperson for the Coca-Cola

company. I'm here today to ask you

to continue buying coke. I'm sure

it's a drink you've been drinking

for years, and if you still enjoy

it, I'd like to remind you to buy

it again sometime soon. It's

basically just brown sugar water,

we haven't changed the ingredients

much lately, so there's nothing new

about it I can say. We changed the

can around a little bit. See, the

colors here are a little different,

and we even put a polar bear on it

for the kids. Also, coke is very

high in sugar, can lead to obesity

in children and adults who don't

sustain a healthy diet, and has a

Ph acidity level high enough to

dissolve teeth and bones over

extended periods of time. Coke also

works great at removing corrosion

from car batteries and loosening

rusted bolts. So that's it, it's

coke. Everyone knows it. It's very

famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,

and I'm asking you to not stop

buying coke. That's all. Thanks.

FADE TO:

16.

FRANK

Hi Mark. How's it going?

MARK

Not so good. Last night I went on a

date with a girl I've had a crush

on for years who will most likely

never call me again and I'm pretty

sure I'm going to get fired today.

You?

FRANK

I spent the whole night throwing up

pain killers because I'm too afraid

to take enough to kill myself.

MARK

See you tomorrow.

FRANK

Bye.

BUSINESS MAN

I'm not talking to anyone on my

cell phone. I only want people to

assume I'm very busy.

17.

GIRLFRIEND

I woke up this morning and realized

that, not only do I not love you,

but that the thought of touching

you sickens me.

BOYFRIEND

The more you hate me the more I

fall in love with you.

HONKING MAN

Move it, fatty!

SCREAMING MAN

This isn't natural! None of this is

natural! We're all animals! This

doesn't feel right! Why am I

wearing clothes? How can you people

live like this? Where did all this

concrete come from?!

WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

I don't want to go in there today.

I just don't. You know?

TOUR GUIDE

All of Lecture Films' productions

are written, filmed and edited

right here on this very lot. In

fact, this building is where

Lecture Films' talented writers

scour through the world's past

events, searching for the most

entertaining, dramatic and even

hilarious moments of world history,

which are then turned into scripts,

handed over to our world-famous

Readers, and filmed for your

viewing pleasure.

TOUR GUIDE

If you'll just follow me over to

this monitor you'll get a sneak

peak at Lecture Film's upcoming

summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon

1812 to 1813."

NARRATOR

Coming this summer from Lecture

Films Motion Picture Studios.

Written by Oscar winning

screenwriter Rob Marlowe.

19.

NARRATOR (O.S.)

And starring Oscar winning Reader

Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic

sequel to last year's most talked

about film: "Napoleon 1810 to

1811". Prepare for the adventure.

NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE

(READING)

And so Napoleon invaded Russia with

a brute force of nearly seven

hundred thousand men behind him

armed with muskets and supported by

canon brigades.

NARRATOR (O.S.)

Learn of his defeat.

NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE

(READING)

Through the devastating snow they

marched, crippled by disease and

hunger, Napoleon's men marched on.

NARRATOR (O.S.)

Listen to his redemption.

TOURIST #1

I love these films. Saves me

reading the book.

NARRATOR

Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this

summer from Lecture Films.

TOUR GUIDE

Look everyone, there goes Mark

Bellison, one of Lecture Films very

own screenwriters!

20.

TOUR GUIDE

He's one of our least successful

writers here at Lecture Films.

(PAUSE)

I also hear he's most likely

getting fired today.

TOUR GUIDE

Now let's head to editing bay where

we can watch....

MARK

Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to

you today.

SHELLEY

Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more

and more how over-qualified I am

for this position and how

incompetent you are at yours.

MARK

Any messages?

SHELLEY

Anthony's coming by within the hour

to see if he can work up the

courage to fire you. If he can't,

he said he'll definitely do it

tomorrow.

MARK

Nobody else called? No calls to do

with actual work?

SHELLEY

Well, I told everybody you were

getting fired this week and not to

expect their calls returned, so no

one left any messages.

MARK

Next time I'd rather you took down

the messages just in case I don't

get fired.

21.

SHELLEY

You're almost definitely getting

fired.

MARK

Well, it hasn't happened yet.

SHELLEY

Okay, but everybody knows you are.

MARK

Okay, I'll be in my office.

SHELLEY

Okay, I'll be searching for new

jobs on Craigslist.

ANTHONY

Wow, you look really depressed

today. That's going to make this so

much harder.

MARK

Anthony, don't fire me.

ANTHONY

Mark, the 1300's are boring.

Nothing interesting happened in

that century. Nobody cares about

the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment

era. The last few scripts you

turned in were depressing.

MARK

They were about the black plague!

It's the 1300's Anthony, what else

am I going to write about!

22.

ANTHONY

It's not totally your fault, Mark.

You got stuck with a bad century.

MARK

No! I can make it work!

ANTHONY

Give it up Mark, it's not like

something new is going to have

happened in the 1300's. At Lecture

Films we're no longer interested in

searching through the less well-

known historical periods for great

events, we just want to take the

big name Reader's of the day and

have them read the historical

events that people know and love:

the holocaust, D-day, the birth of

electricity. These are the stories

people want to see, because they

know them. They find comfort in

them.

ANTHONY

Do you think I could come back and

do this tomorrow? I just got very

nervous about firing you. I don't

do well with confrontation.

MARK

Is there anyway you could do it

now? I'd rather not put it off.

ANTHONY

(MEEKLY)

You're fired?

MARK

Damn.

23.

MARK

She's a really good writer, too.

SHELLEY

I loathed almost every minute I

worked for you.

MARK

I often fantasized about you naked.

SHELLEY

What are you going to do now?

MARK

I have no idea. But I have very

little hope for the future.

SHELLEY

I don't have much hope for you

either, but I wish you good luck.

MARK

Bye, Shelley.

SHELLEY

Bye, Mark.

ROB

So they fucking fired you, huh

dipshit? I always knew the Black

Plague would never work as a movie.

Guess the 1300's were as much of a

loser as you are.

MARK

Please don't make me feel worse. Or

actually whatever, go ahead, I

don't think I could possibly feel

worse.

24.

ROB

I fucking always hated you. You're

a shitty writer assigned to a

shitty century and you're a little

man bitch. But I was always

threatened by you because I knew

there was something different about

you that I didn't understand and I

fucking hate things I don't

understand. But you will always be

a loser and I will always be more

successful than you in nearly every

way. That's just the way it is. And

Shelley calls you an ass fag behind

your back.

MARK

Well, now I feel worse.

RECEPTIONIST

Are you looking to abandon an

elderly person?

MARK

I already have. Martha Bellison.

I'm her grandson.

RECEPTIONIST

Ooh, it's good you're here. She's

not doing well. You should say your

final goodbyes today.

MARK

You say that every time I'm here.

RECEPTIONIST

She's at the top of our death pool.

25.

ELDERLY PERSON #1

You look like my dead son.

ELDERLY PERSON #3

Life gets worse with each passing

minute.

ELDERLY PERSON #4

I'm on pills that make everything

orange.

MARK

Oh Grandma, that is so depressing.

Come on, at least stare at the

ceiling or something.

MARTHA

The television is broken.

MARK

The television isn't broken. You

probably sat on the remote and

changed it to channel two again.

MARK

See, you had it on the wrong

channel. It needs to be on channel

three in order for the satellite to

work.

MARTHA

I don't understand anything you

just said and that makes me scared

and angry.

26.

MARK

MARTHA

MARK

MARTHA

MARK

MARTHA

MARK

MARTHA

(MORE)

27.

MARTHA (cont'd)

And maybe one day you'll have a

wife that you love very much too.

MARK

Yeah, but I'm not talking about the

past, Grandma. I'm talking about

right now. And right now we're both

losers, Grandma. We're both shitty,

shitty losers. Don't you know that?

MARTHA

I suppose we are. But things could

be worse. We could be homeless.

MARK

I'd rather be dead than be

homeless. That's why I need to get

out there and find a job. If I have

to be homeless, I'm going to kill

myself.

MARTHA

Well that's sad. I love you, Mark.

Good luck finding a job!

MARK

I love you too, Grandma.

MARTHA (O.S.)

Oops.

MARK

I'll start looking for a job

tomorrow.

GREG

Lately I don't like Indian people.

(PAUSE)

I don't like white people even more

though. I fucking hate white

people. I fucking hate people.

28.

MARK

Hey, thanks for setting me up with

your cousin by the way.

GREG

Third cousin. She's hot right?

MARK

Very.

GREG

Way out of your league. Dunno why

you bothered.

MARK

It felt nice to go out with someone

that pretty. Like for just one

moment I experienced what it would

be like to be the type of person

someone like that would date. It

felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I

will always be just who I am right

now: average looking, of average

intelligence with an average

personality. Just a completely

generic human being.

GREG

Your life is still better than

mine.

MARK

By a good margin.

GREG

Lately I've been crying in my sleep

and waking up in a pool of urine.

MARK

I really wish I had a better friend

than you.

GREG

So, what are you going to do now?

MARK

I don't know. Guess I'll start

looking for another crappy job.

29.

GREG

Doubt you'll find one. Not much

need for an out-of-work writer

specializing in the Black Plague.

MARK

I'm going to go now. You're

seriously depressing me. I really

wish I was cool enough to have a

better friend than you.

GREG

I'm the best you're gonna get, man.

Call me later.

MARK

Yeah.

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)

Hello?

JENNIFER (ON PHONE)

Hello? I can hear you breathing. Is

this a rapist?

MARK

(QUICKLY)

No, it's Mark. I'm sorry.

FADE TO:

MARK

Shut the fuck up, I don't even have

a job!

30.

LANDLORD

I'm here for the rent.

MARK

I was going to come talk to you

about that. I got fired yesterday.

LANDLORD

I know. That's why I'm here for the

rent.

MARK

Well, I haven't got it.

LANDLORD

How much do you have?

MARK

I think I've got about three

hundred dollars in my bank account.

LANDLORD

The rent is eight hundred dollars.

MARK

I know. I haven't got it.

LANDLORD

Then you're evicted. I'll help you

with your things.

LANDLORD

Help me with the couch. It looks

heavy.

31.

LANDLORD

You have one day to get your things

out of this hallway.

MARK

How am I supposed to do that?

LANDLORD

You've got three hundred dollars.

Rent a truck.

MARK

Oh, fuck me.

BANK TELLER

How can I help you today?

MARK

I'd like to make a withdrawal.

BANK TELLER

Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help

you with that.

MARK

I've just been evicted from my

apartment so I need to withdraw

what I have left in my account so I

can move my things out. I guess I

need to close out my account to do

that.

(PAUSE)

I think I'm about to be homeless.

32.

BANK TELLER

Unfortunately sir the system is

down right now so I'm not going to

be able to perform an account

closure until the system is back

up. But I can assist you in a

withdrawal. How much would you like

to withdraw?

MARK

Well, I'd like to withdraw eight

hundred dollars.

BANK TELLER

How much are you going to withdraw

today, sir?

MARK

All of it. Just whatever is left.

BANK TELLER

The system is down, sir. Please

tell me how much you have in your

account?

BANK TELLER

Sir?

MARK

(awkwardly fast)

Eight hundred dollars.

BANK TELLER

Pardon me?

33.

MARK

(more confident)

I have eight hundred dollars in my

bank account.

BANK TELLER

Wait a second here. The system just

came back up.

(to co-worker)

System seems to be back up, guys.

(to Mark)

Just one second while I access your

account. You said you're

withdrawing eight hundred, correct?

MARK

Yup.

BANK TELLER

Well, look at this. It says here

you've only got three hundred

dollars in your account. But you

said you wanted to withdraw eight

hundred?

BANK TELLER

I apologize for this sir, but it

seems our system has made a

mistake. Hold on one second while I

go and get your eight hundred

dollars. Did you want that in large

or small bills?

MARK

Large bills.

34.

BANK TELLER

(to co-worker)

Guys the computers seem to be a bit

buggy. Will someone call James to

come in and look into it, please?

BANK TELLER

There you are. Eight hundred

dollars. Anything else I can do for

you today?

BANK TELLER

Sometimes our computers can get a

bit buggy, especially when the

system goes down. Sorry for any

inconvenience.

MARK

It's no problem.

LANDLORD

What are you doing here?

MARK

Paying my rent.

LANDLORD

Where did you get this money?

35.

MARK

It was amazing. I went in to the

bank and the system was down and I

was going to take out three hundred

dollars but she asked me how much

I'd like to take out and...

MARK

I found it. Lying on the street.

LANDLORD

Okay. Lucky.

MARK

Give me my key back.

MARK (V.O.)

Today I stumbled upon something no

man has ever stumbled upon before.

What I have done today they will

write about in history books for

generations to come. And yet, only

moments ago... it was unfathomable

not only to myself, but to mankind

as a whole. What I have found there

is no word for. And it was as

simple as...

(long pause)

... how do I explain this...

(long pause)

CUT TO:

MARK (CONT'D)

... I said something... that

wasn't.

36.

GREG

Huh?

MARK

I said something... that... wasn't.

I... what's the word I'm looking

for? Well, there is no word. Of

course there's not, I just invented

it.

MARK

Here. Watch.

(calling over bartender)

Jim.

JIM

What?

MARK

(PROFOUNDLY)

My name is Doug.

GREG

(dead serious)

Your name is Doug.

JIM

(without hesitation)

Hi Doug.

GREG

It amazes me that I never knew your

real name.

(PAUSE)

Doug is good. It suits you.

MARK

Come on guys. Are you serious?

What's my name?

37.

GREG

It's Doug.

JIM

Doug.

MARK

No. My name is Mark.

GREG

(still dead serious)

Your name is Mark.

JIM

(still without hesitation)

Hi Mark.

GREG

Mark suits you much better.

JIM

Mark-o.

MARK

You guys aren't following me.

(THINKING)

Okay, guys...I'm black.

GREG

I knew it.

JIM

You're very light skinned, but I

can see it.

GREG

I've always wanted a black friend.

MARK

Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo.

GREG

Fantastic.

JIM

I've never seen a black Eskimo.

MARK

Okay, I'm a pirate.

GREG

I didn't know they still had those.

38.

JIM

Are you a dangerous pirate?

MARK

Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and

I have purple hair.

GREG

Aren't you scared you'll get bitten

one day?

JIM

(to Greg)

I want to die my hair purple just

like Mark's.

JIM

I'm a one-armed Jewish space

explorer.

GREG

When's your launch date?

JIM

Shalom. How'd you lose your arm?

MARK

I invented the bicycle.

GREG

I love your work.

JIM

Can you get me a discount on a ten

speed?

MARK

I give up. And I'm bored.

MARK

Guys, if you had the power to make

things the way you wanted them,

what would you do first?

39.

GREG

If I could do anything in the

world?

JIM

Anything at all?

MARK

Pretty much.

GREG

I'd bone bitches asses.

JIM

Right in the ass.

MARK

Specifically the ass?

GREG

If I could change things I would

make all the hot chicks bone me.

JIM

Agreed.

MARK

Alright then, let's try that.

GREG

Where are you going?

MARK

Out.

40.

BLONDE

Don't look at me, I'm not attracted

to you.

MARK

Wait!

BLONDE

Don't bother. I've heard it all

before.

MARK

(BLURTING)

THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE

DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW!

BLONDE

Do we have time to get to a motel

or do we have to do it right here?

BLONDE

(BAWLING)

I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I

don't want the world to end.

(MORE)

41.

BLONDE (cont'd)

I don't want to die in this motel

room. I think I'm going to throw

up. Help me get my pants off.

MARK

This isn't right.

BLONDE

No! We have to have sex! The world

is going to end! Think of the

children and little babies!

MARK

Just calm down for one second.

BLONDE

How can I be calm? The world might

end any second! DON'T YOU

UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO

DIE!!

MARK

(to phone)

Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh,

good. That's very good news. Good

news indeed.

MARK

We're going to be okay. The world

isn't going to end. Everyone is

going to be fine.

BLONDE

WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to

live! Thank you! Thank you!

42.

BLONDE

This has been the worst... and the

best... day of my life.

MARK

Okay, I gotta go.

BLONDE

Oh no, please stay. We've been

through so much together.

MARK

I'm an asshole.

BLONDE

(SPITEFUL)

Well, I hate assholes. Get out of

here.

MARK

That was one of the worst

experiences of my life.

GREG

(SHIT-FACED)

Did you invent a new kind of bike?

MARK

What else would you do if you could

do anything in the world?

GREG

Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd

do.

43.

MARK

What else though. What's the second

thing you'd do.

GREG

What else would you do, dipshit?

MARK

I'd get money. I'd get all the

money.

MARK

Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's

go.

GREG

What?

MARK

We're going on a trip.

GREG

I'll drive.

MARK

Thanks for driving man, I'm

completely plastered.

GREG

I'm just as hammered as you. But I

don't care if I get arrested. I'm

trying to hit bottom.

GREG

Here comes bottom.

44.

COP

Nothing safer than pulling over two

nerdy white guys in their forties.

GREG

I don't want to go to jail.

COP

Are you drunk?

GREG

Yes.

COP

Then you're going to jail.

Blow in here, son.

MARK

Wait, officer. Don't do that.

COP

I don't think you can afford my

bribe, son.

MARK

How much does it cost to bribe you?

COP

At least five grand.

MARK AND GREG

Wow, that's high.

COP

I need to feel that I've got some

sense of integrity.

COP

Whoa, that's off the charts. Step

out of the car, son. You're drunk

and going to jail.

MARK

Wait.

(PAUSE)

He's not drunk.

45.

COP

Oh.

COP

Damn thing must be broken.

COP

(to Greg)

Son, you might want to drive

yourself to the nearest hospital.

You have food poisoning or some

kind of flu.

COP

(to Mark)

Maybe you oughta drive, son.

MARK

Good idea.

MARK

That was awesome!

GREG

Stop laughing, I'm sick.

MARK

You're gonna be all right, Greg.

GREG

Oh good!

46.

GREG

Stupid stomach flu.

(PAUSE)

Where are we going?

MARK

Vegas, baby. Vegas.

GREG

What are we doing here? We don't

have any money to throw away.

MARK

Sure we do.

GREG

What is that, a few hundred bucks?

That's not going to last us very

long.

MARK

Sure it will.

MARK

Chips please.

CHIP WOMAN

There's a very good chance you'll

lose all this money here tonight.

MARK

I know.

47.

CHIP WOMAN

And even if you do happen to win,

there's an even better chance that

in the long run we'll win it back.

MARK

I know.

CHIP WOMAN

Some of the games are fixed. Like

all the ones that use computers.

MARK

I know.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

If I could be a stripper I would,

but I'm not attractive enough.

Drinks, guys?

GREG

No. I have a stomach flu.

MARK

We'll both have beers and we'll

take them at that roulette table

over there.

GREG

Oh come on, roulette is the

stupidest game of them all. It's

pure chance, no skill whatsoever.

MARK

It's okay. I'm feeling lucky.

GREG

You've never had a lucky day in

your life.

MARK

Just watch.

48.

ROULETTE DEALER

Get your bets in, get your bets in.

The house always wins in the long

run. Because of the zero's on the

board every bet is slightly favored

towards the house.

ROULETTE DEALER

Twenty-seven red. No one wins.

MARK

I'm on twenty-seven red.

ROULETTE DEALER

We have a winner. Congratulations,

sir.

GREG

You did it. You just, like,

quadrupled your money. You lucky

son of a bitch.

MARK

That's nothing. Watch this.

ROULETTE DEALER

Get your bets in, get your bets in.

The house always wins in the long

run. Fork over your money right

here folks. I say this so often I

want to kill myself.

ROULETTE DEALER

Nine black. No winners.

49.

MARK

I'm on nine black. These are all

mine.

ROULETTE DEALER

Nine black wins. Big winner.

Congratulations, sir.

GREG

Do it again.

MARK

I don't think I should. Lets go

play slots.

MARK

Hi, I just won a major jackpot on

this slot machine but no money came

out.

PIT MAN

I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me

get that fixed for you. And can I

say congratulations, sir.

MARK

Thank you.

50.

GREG

This is the most amazing night of

my life.

GREG

It amazes me the winning streak

you're on. You must be the luckiest

man in the world.

MARK

Well, sort of.

GREG

It was like we couldn't lose.

MARK

We couldn't lose.

GREG

Do you have a system?

MARK

I've got a system.

GREG

Well, with your system in just a

few weeks I figure we could be the

richest people in the world.

MARK

And then what?

GREG

Well, here's what I'm thinking. We

take all the money in the world...

and put it on black.

MARK

Why put it on black? Why stop

there? Put it on a number and get

thirty five times back.

GREG

That's exactly what we'll do.

51.

MARK

Hold on, I think I found a flaw in

your plan. How can they pay us if

we have all the money in the world?

GREG

Well, they'd just have to.

MARK

Well, they can't because we've got

it all.

GREG

Well, they'd better find it. They

can't let us bet if they're not

going to pay us back. They'll have

to just give us the casino.

MARK

We already own the casino. We've

got all the money in the world.

We'll be betting against ourselves.

GREG

Then we'll go to another casino.

MARK

We own that one too. We won that.

GREG

So we own all the casino's?

MARK

Yup.

GREG

And if we win we can't pay us back

because we already have all the

money?

MARK

Yes.

GREG

Only one thing we can do then.

MARK

I'm listening.

GREG

Take ourselves into the back room

and break our own fingers.

52.

MARK

Brilliant.

MARK

Hey there, Frank.

FRANK

Mark. How's it going?

MARK

Pretty good, thanks.

FRANK

Really?

MARK

Yeah. You?

FRANK

Awful. I was doing some internet

research last night about

suffocation suicide. I'm probably

going to give that a try tonight.

MARK

Oh.

(PAUSE)

All right. Bye, Frank.

FRANK

Bye.

MARK

Frank!

FRANK

Yeah?

MARK

Don't do it.

53.

FRANK

Why not? I'm miserable. And no one

will care.

MARK

I'll care.

FRANK

You're a loser, though.

MARK

Don't do it, Frank. Things are

going to be all right.

FRANK

They are?

MARK

Yes. You're going to meet someone

soon. You won't be so lonely.

Things are going to turn around at

your job.

FRANK

My job's actually fine.

MARK

Well, things are going to get

better. Better than they are.

FRANK

What about the depression?

MARK

It will go away very soon. You're

going to be happy soon, Frank. You

just need to wait for it. Listen to

me: you don't need to kill

yourself.

FRANK

Really?

MARK

Really.

54.

FRANK

Wow. Man, and that suffocation

thing really seemed like a good

idea.

MARK

It wasn't.

FRANK

Okay. Well, my night's open now.

You want to hang out later?

MARK

I don't know. Not really.

MARK

Sure. Of course. Let's hang out.

FRANK

I'll see you after work.

MARK

Great.

MARK (V.O.)

(WRITING)

I've discovered something today

very important... and very

powerful.

MARK (V.O.)

I'm as excited as I've ever been in

my entire life, and equally scared.

(MORE)

55.

MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)

I'm writing this down in a letter

in case this thing I've discovered

somehow ends up killing me. I want

to ensure that, even if I wasn't

strong enough to use it, that my

invention doesn't once again

disappear, never to be discovered

again.

MARK (V.O.)

In just a few hours since I

stumbled upon my discovery I have

seen its potential for evil and I

have seen its potential for good.

MARK (V.O.)

I must be careful with my

discovery, for at this point I

barely understand it, let alone

think I have the power to control

it. All I know is that if I'm not

careful I could easily do

irreparable damage to the world, or

even cause my own premature death.

MARK (V.O.)

Now, to explain my invention. In

essence, my creation is the act of

saying words that simply are not.

For example, if I tell someone that

my eyes are blue, then it simply

becomes fact. I still know that,

indeed, my eyes are brown, but no

one else is aware of this fact, so

therefore I have blue eyes.

(MORE)

56.

MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)

It's a game of numbers: there is

only one of me who knows I have

brown eyes, and so many of them who

do not. The numbers always win.

MARK

Whoever is reading this, go ahead

and try it. Tell someone your eyes

are a different color then they

are. I think you'll be amazed at

the results. It's so simple and

yet... so powerful... this thing

I've invented.

MARK (V.O.)

Au Revoir, future reader, au

revoir.

MARK

Jennifer. It's Mark.

JENNIFER

Are you gonna hang up on me again?

MARK

No. Maybe. Who knows. I'm calling

because I want to ask you out on

another date.

JENNIFER

Why would you do that?

57.

MARK

I discovered something yesterday. I

found out I can pretty much have my

life anyway I want it from now on.

JENNIFER

Congratulations. I gotta go.

MARK

Wait, and I know you said you

didn't want to date me ever again,

but I'm different now. Things have

changed. I think I'm in your league

now.

JENNIFER

You're better looking?

MARK

No. I'm not better looking. I'm

just more... powerful. I think you

have to see it for yourself.

JENNIFER

Have you been to the gym?

MARK

No, I haven't been to the gym. It's

just... it's amazing. Things are

different for me now. You have to

see this. I think you'll hardly

recognize me.

JENNIFER

Did you buy better clothes?

MARK

No, look can we just meet up?

MARK

Jennifer, If there was even a

glimmer of something about me that

you liked, please say yes. You even

admitted that we got along well.

Just give me one more chance. Just

one little teensy, tiny date.

JENNIFER

Okay, fine.

58.

MARK

Fantastic. Tomorrow night. I'll

pick you up at eight.

JENNIFER

Most likely it'll be our last date

though, so just know that.

MARK

(SARCASTIC)

That's very sweet.

JENNIFER

No it wasn't. Did you not hear what

I said?

MARK

Yeah, no I was being...

(pause; searching)

...there's no word for it. See you

tomorrow night.

JENNIFER

Bye.

MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V)

In Our World.... in the 1800's...

MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V)

... came the greatest revolution of

them all.

(climactic music)

The Industrial Revolution.

MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V)

Written by famed screenwriter Rob

Marlowe and read by Oscar winning

Reader Angelo Badsmith.

ANGELO BADSMITH

Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come

watch me read about the exciting

events that took place during the

Industrial Revolution.

(MORE)

59.

ANGELO BADSMITH (cont'd)

Also, I will tell you all about my

personal misfortunes, such as my

wife who cheated on me with a man

named Perry.

MARK

Rob Marlowe, your streak of success

has finally come to an end.

FADE TO:

SHELLEY (O.S.)

He's gone crazy!

60.

ROB

Come to beg for your old job back?

Hey everybody, here's the loser who

thought the Black Plague would make

for an interesting film. Good luck,

douche bag. Freaking loser.

ANTHONY (ON PHONE)

They're going to fire me any

moment, I just know it. I'm really,

really horrible at my job. I don't

know anything about movies. I don't

even like movies. I like sports.

Head of development, what does that

even mean? I'm not a smart person.

Okay, talk to you later.

ANTHONY

That was the head of the studio.

(PAUSE)

I'm very scared that you're mad at

me about the whole firing thing.

MARK

I'm not mad at all.

ANTHONY

Oh good, because I feel really bad

about it. I mean, I would be

horrible at your job too. I would

be horrible at any job in this

place.

(PAUSE)

I love sports.

61.

ANTHONY

Why are you here?

MARK

When you fired me, I was very

depressed.

ANTHONY

I knew it.

MARK

And so I left this building and I

just started walking. And I walked

all the way out of town. And then I

walked into the desert and I fell

asleep under a tree.

ANTHONY

I don't do well with other people's

life changing events.

MARK

And when I woke up I found this

strange old chest sticking out of

the ground. So I started digging.

And I unearthed a very old and

ancient box. Probably, oh...

about... seven hundred years old.

And inside the box...

(holding up manuscript)

... was this.

ANTHONY

What is it?

MARK

It's a never-before-heard

historical event from the past.

ANTHONY

When does it take place?

MARK

The 1300's.

62.

ANTHONY

I told you we're not interested in

Black Plague movies here, Mark.

MARK

This one isn't about the black

plague. Well it isn't just about

the black plague. Let me read you

some of this.

MARK

Anthony, get excited about this.

This is a brand new event from

history that no one has ever heard

before. It's a great human

discovery.

ANTHONY

Yeah, but is there a movie there?

MARK

The greatest movie Lecture Films

has ever made.

ANTHONY

Start reading.

MARK

(READING)

On the very first day of the

fourteenth century, a momentous

occasion occurred. It began as a

day much like any other. The sun

rose, the people awoke, workers

began to work, babies began to cry.

But all of that was interrupted

when a giant flying space ship

crashed down from the skies and

landed in the heart of Babylon.

ANTHONY

What?!

63.

ANTHONY (ON PHONE)

I want everyone in here now! We've

got a BIG ONE.

ANTHONY

Please, Mark. Continue.

MARK

(READING)

As the smoke cleared, the door to

the spaceship opened and inside,

were hundreds of beautiful, half

naked alien women.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARK

(READING)

And then the ninja army unleashed a

giant fireball that brought the

robot dinosaur to its knees, saving

Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian

Alien Women all in one sweeping

motion. The earth was saved.

Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to

marry by alien king Xardon. It was

to be the First Human-Nude

Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and

no expenses would be spared. All of

Babylon and Mars were invited to

join in the celebrations.

MARK

(READING)

The wedding was held on a brisk

summers day on Mars, with all of

the survivors of the Great Ninja

War and the Black Plague present.

They feasted and danced and laughed

and it was a joyous occasion.

(MORE)

64.

MARK (cont'd)

The moment the bride and groom

kissed, King Xardon performed a

mind-wipe on all of the humans,

thereby erasing all knowledge of

these events from their minds, and

sent them back to Babylon. For

seven hundred years these events

would be forgotten by mankind until

one day, a great writer by the name

of Mark Bellison, would stumble

upon them in the desert, after

being fired by his shit boss

Anthony and mocked by Rob and

Shelly, two huge douche bags.

Lecture Films Motion Picture

Studios would go on to make the

picture and it would be a big

success, and Mark would become very

wealthy and famous from it. The

End.

ANTHONY

Mark, tell us what it's called.

MARK

(to Rob)

The Black Plague.

JENNIFER

Congratulations on selling your

script today.

MARK

Thanks. Thank you for having dinner

with me.

65.

JENNIFER

Everyone needs to eat.

(PAUSE)

And I enjoy your company.

WAITER

I'm an extremely important waiter.

(PAUSE)

What can I get you?

MARK

I don't want to know what it is, I

just want to order the most

expensive thing on the menu.

JENNIFER

I'll have the duck. And I think you

look like a little rat faced man.

WAITER

Okay, I'll have those right up for

you.

JENNIFER

Things seem to be turning around

for you.

MARK

Today is the best day of my life.

Hands down. Easy. Best day.

JENNIFER

It's not every day you unearth a

monumental historical event and

sell it for a ton of money.

MARK

That wasn't the best part. It was

great, but it wasn't the peak of my

day.

(PAUSE)

I've had a crush on you ever since

I saw a picture of you on Greg's

refrigerator two years ago.

JENNIFER

Oh.

66.

MARK

The best part of my day today is

right now, sitting at this table

here with you.

JENNIFER

Oh.

MARK

You're the most beautiful woman

I've ever seen in my life, and

you're special... and it makes me

happy to be around you.

JENNIFER

Thank you.

JENNIFER

Tell me something about your

family. I really don't know much

about you.

MARK

Ah, my family. We're what you'd

probably call "not lucky". My whole

family is kind of marked by

tragedy, bad luck and general...

shittiness. It goes back a long

ways and could probably drive

someone to suicide just hearing

about it, so I'll keep it simple.

My mom died when I was six. Cancer.

JENNIFER

Sad.

MARK

And my dad got real depressed and

lost his job. Out of work and with

a kid to raise he had no choice but

to turn to a life of crime.

JENNIFER

What kind of crime?

MARK

He was a robber. Houses mostly.

DISSOLVE TO:

67.

MARK'S DAD (O.S.)

(on answer machine)

Hi, I'm calling to let you know

I'll be robbing your house today.

I'll probably be there within the

hour.

(PAUSE)

I hope you're not there.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARK

He was a very unlucky man. He spent

his last days behind bars. I never

really knew him.

(sad moment; pause)

But I guess I've also had a little

luck in my life. I did have a

wonderful grandmother who raised

me.

JENNIFER

Oh, that's sweet.

MARK

Yeah, she's great.

JENNIFER

Where is she?

MARK

Old person's home obviously. Who

wants to live with that? Gross.

JENNIFER

I know, right?

MARK

But I'm going to get her out of

there tomorrow.

(MORE)

68.

MARK (cont'd)

I'm going to buy her a big

beautiful mansion where she can

spend her few remaining days in

luxury.

JENNIFER

That's nice.

WAITER

I don't know what's wrong with the

chef today, but these just look

awful.

MARK

They look fine to me.

WAITER

Well, you're stupid.

MARK

Right. I was thinking that since

I'm going to be rich and successful

now that I might be in your league.

(PAUSE)

And that maybe we could be

together. Romantically.

JENNIFER

What would be the point?

MARK

Well, I don't know, maybe we might

enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good

together and could have a happy

life, raise a family together.

JENNIFER

Well, I do like you. And I enjoy

your company.

(MORE)

69.

JENNIFER (cont'd)

And if we were to get together and

procreate I would like the

offspring that are carrying half my

genetic code to be well taken care

of and financially stable. I also

think you'd make a good father and

a good husband, which I like.

MARK

Good. Fantastic.

JENNIFER

Unfortunately, none of that changes

the fact that you'd still be

contributing half of the genetic

code to our children.

(PAUSE)

I don't want short, fat kids with

little snub noses.

MARK

Sure.

MARK (ON PHONE)

Hello?

(PAUSE)

What?

MARK (ON PHONE)

(LOUDLY)

WHAT?

MARK

Grandma, they just called me.

What's going on? Are you okay?

70.

MARTHA

I don't know, I fell on my way back

to my room.

MARK

What do the doctors say?

MARTHA

They say I'll probably die tonight.

MARK

What?

DOCTOR

Oh, hello. I was just coming in to

check on her, you must be Martha

Bellison's grandson.

MARK

What are you talking about she's

going to die?

DOCTOR

I'm sorry. It just doesn't look

good. She's suffered a major heart

attack and her heart is very weak,

her pulse not very strong, her

blood pressure is dropping rapidly

and most likely she'll have a fatal

heart attack during the night.

MARK

Fuck.

DOCTOR

Yup, still going to die.

DOCTOR

I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt

something for you two, but I really

don't. I do this exact thing about

thirty times a night and it's

really hardened me to human

suffering. On a side note, it's

fajita night at the cafeteria

downstairs. You might think about

grabbing a bite to eat there after

your grandma dies.

71.

MARTHA

I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want

to die. You know, people don't talk

about it much, but death is a

horrible thing. One minute you're

alive, there's a whole world around

you, humming and jumping, people

coming in and out, doors opening

and closing, love and anger and the

whole mess of it all, and then like

that, it's all gone.

(CRYING)

This is it Mark, only a few hours

left of this until an eternity of

nothingness.

MARK

Grandma!

NURSE #1

She's seizing.

MARTHA

I'm scared.

MARK

Listen closely to me, Grandma. I

have a surprise for you.

MARK

You're wrong about what happens

when you die. It's not an eternity

of nothingness.

72.

MARK

When you die you're going to go to

your favorite place in the whole

world. And you're going to be with

all of the people you've ever loved

and who have ever loved you. And

you're going to be young again, and

you'll be able to run through the

fields and dance and jump, and

there will be no sadness, no pain,

just love and laughing and

happiness. There will be ponies

made of gold, and everyone will

live in giant mansions, and

everything will smell like cookies.

And it will last for an eternity,

Grandma. An eternity.

NURSE #1

Go on.

DOCTOR

What else happens?

MARK

Do your jobs!

MARK

You're going to be happy forever,

grandma. I promise you. Say hello

to my mom for me. Tell her I love

her.

NURSE #2

(TEARFULLY)

I'm going to see my mother again

when I die.

DOCTOR

Tell us more, please.

73.

MARK

Damn it.

JENNIFER

I'm so sorry, Mark.

MARK

I think I just did something bad.

JENNIFER

Do you want to come inside?

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP:

74.

JENNIFER

Hi.

MARK

Hi.

NURSE #1

There he is!

PERSON #1

Is there only one place you go when

you die?

PERSON #2

Will everyone who has ever died be

there?

PERSON #3

What's this place called?

PERSON #4

Will I get to have sex with people

there?

NURSE #1

You owe us an explanation. If you

know something this important, you

better tell us all.

MARK

Who are you people?

75.

NURSE #1

The words you spoke last night, to

your grandmother, spread like

wildfire. Please, tell us more.

Explain what you said.

MARK

Fine, fine, just give me a minute.

JENNIFER (V.O.)

(leaving message)

You've been gone for twenty minutes

and I turn on the T.V to see you on

every station. What's going on?

This is seriously the weirdest

thing...

MARK

Remember last night when I said I

think I did something bad? Well now

I know I did something bad.

JENNIFER

They're saying that you know

something different about what

happens after you die.

MARK

Hold on.

REPORTER (ON T.V)

Twenty-four hours ago, Mark

Bellison was just your typical

nobody writer.

(MORE)

76.

REPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd)

Today, people are saying he knows

new information about what happens

after you die.

MARK

Fuck.

JENNIFER

Mark, what do you know? What did

you tell your grandmother last

night? What's going on?

MARK

I can't explain it all right now.

Why don't you come over?

JENNIFER

Okay.

MARK

Come up quick, they look like they

could get out of hand any second.

JENNIFER

Just tell me what you told your

grandmother.

MARK

I don't think I should. Who knows

what could happen next? I'm just

going to keep my mouth shut from

now on.

JENNIFER

What you said obviously affected a

lot of people. I don't think you

have the choice to keep it in now.

77.

MARK

Sure I do. I could just walk out

that door and get on a plane and go

to Namibia. No one knows me in

Namibia.

JENNIFER

Just tell me what you said. Please,

Mark.

MARK

My grandmother was dying, and she

was terrified, shaking all over.

She didn't want to just become

nothingness. So I told her that

when she died there wouldn't be

nothingness. That she would be with

all of the people she loved who had

died and that she would live an

eternity of joy and happiness.

JENNIFER

(barely able to speak)

How do you know these things?

JENNIFER

You have to tell them everything

you know. This is too big. You have

no choice.

MARK

But you don't understand. The words

I said... they weren't... it's not

right.

JENNIFER

How did your grandmother feel when

you told her these things?

MARK

Happy. At peace.

JENNIFER

And how did that make you feel?

78.

MARK

Good.

JENNIFER

(sweeping her hand over

the crowd)

Think how good it will feel to do

the same for all of these people.

MARK

Okay. But I need a few hours to get

my thoughts together.

JENNIFER

I'll go tell them.

MARK

Wait! Are you sure this is right?

JENNIFER

Of course it is. You know something

that's going to change mankind

forever. It's the most important

thing the world has ever heard.

DISSOLVE TO:

GREG

I brought pizza. How come you never

told me we all get mansions?

MARK

I didn't...

79.

GREG

Inventing the bicycle is one thing,

but this...

JENNIFER

Shut up. Let him work.

NEWSCASTER (ON T.V)

In Seoul Korea, they wait. In Rome,

Italy, they wait. In London,

England, they wait. In New York

City, they wait. The world has come

to a standstill, everyone at their

televisions and radios, or here on

this lawn, waiting for Mark

Bellison to come forth and tell the

people what he knows.

MARK

I'm done.

JENNIFER

Are you ready?

MARK

I guess.

80.

MARK

I feel like I should be reading

these off of something other than

just notebook paper. I wish they

were like, written on large tablets

or even just nicer paper or

something.

MARK

Feels better.

JENNIFER

Just tell them what you know

GREG

Good luck out there, man.

YOUNG MAN

I heard that he said we all get

mansions, and that there's even

ponies.

NEWSCASTER

(to cameraman)

Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These

are the things we can all expect

when we die. What else can we

expect? We won't know until Mark

Bellison steps out of that...

YOUNG MAN

(SHOUTING)

THERE HE IS!

81.

MARK

Hello.

MARK

Oh, thanks.

MARK

Wow.

MARK

So. I guess you've all heard the

things I told my grandmother last

night and... I understand why

you're here.

(PAUSE)

I know... some things. Some very

important things. And I'm going to

share these things with you now.

MARK

Everything you want to know is

written here. On this old pizza

box.

MARK

(READING)

Number one: There is a man who

lives in the sky who controls

everything. Number two...

MAN #1

(interrupting; shouting)

Whoa, whoa whoa. What does he look

like?

82.

MARK

(STRUGGLING)

Tall. Big hands. A good head of

hair.

WOMAN #1

What ethnicity is he?

MARK

(making it up as he goes)

He's a new ethnicity. It's like a

mix of all of our ethnicities.

MAN #2

Does he live on a cloud?

MAN #3

Can we see him?

MARK

(becoming confident)

No. He lives much higher than the

clouds, too high to see.

WOMAN #2

So he lives in space?

MARK

No, not that high.

MAN #3

So you mean the Thermosphere?

MARK

Look, people I got a lot to get

through here. I'm just telling you

what I know: Man. Lives in the sky.

You can't see him. Controls

everything. Cool?

MARK

Number two: When you die you don't

disappear into an eternity of

nothingness. Instead, you go to a

really great place.

(PAUSE)

Number three: In that place every

person will get a mansion.

MAN #4

What kind of mansion?

83.

MARK

I don't know. Whatever kind of

mansion you're thinking of right

now.

WOMAN #3

Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a

mansion!

MAN #5

Shit! I was thinking of a horrible

mansion!

MARK

Look, it's the best mansion you can

think of, not just now, but ever.

Whatever the best mansion for you

can possibly be, that's the one

you'll get.

(CONTINUING)

Number four: When you die, all the

people you love will be there too.

MAN #6

Will they have their own mansions?

MARK

Yes, of course. Everyone gets a

mansion.

MAN #6

What if I want them to live in my

mansion?

MARK

If they want to live with you, they

can leave their mansion and live in

yours.

MAN #6

What happens to their mansion?

MARK

I don't know, it goes back on the

market.

WOMAN #4

What about the people I hate? Will

they be there too?

MARK

No.

84.

WOMAN #4

MARK

WOMAN #4

WOMAN #4

(CONTINUING)

WOMAN #5

WOMAN #5

MAN #8

MARK

WOMAN #6

MARK

(CONTINUING)

(MORE)

85.

MARK (cont'd)

Number six: If you do bad things

you won't get to go to this great

place when you die.

MAN #9

Where will you go?

MARK

A terrible place. The worst place

imaginable.

WOMAN #7

What constitutes a bad thing?

MARK

Murder. Crime. Rape. Things like

that.

WOMAN #7

You have to tell us all the things

or else we might do them and it

wouldn't be our fault!

MARK

Fine.

MAN #9

Is punching someone bad?

MARK

Yes.

MAN #9

What if they're trying to hurt you?

MARK

Then it's fine.

WOMAN #7

Is cursing bad?

MARK

No.

WOMAN #1

What about being late for work?

86.

MARK

That's fine too. I mean, you might

lose your job if your boss doesn't

like it, but it won't effect what

happens after you die.

WOMAN #2

What about if you forget to feed

your dog?

MARK

That also is fine. Unless the dog

dies. Then it's bad.

MAN #1

If you do just one bad thing do you

go to the bad place?

MARK

No. You get...

(thinking about it)

... three chances. If you do three

bad things you're out.

MAN #1

Like baseball!

MARK

Kind of, yes.

MARK

Any more?

MARK

Look, can we just move on?

MAN #2

No! We have to know everything

that's bad!

MARK

Fine. Let's start with you...

(POINTING)

MAN #3

Is it bad to wear pants?

87.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARK

No. There's no hairstyle that will

put you in the bad place. Like I've

told you, the main things are

hurting people physically on

purpose, taking people's stuff,

doing things to people they don't

want done, killing people on

purpose. Okay? Are we good?

CRYING MAN

(SHAMEFUL)

I've done many of those bad things.

Is there anything I can do to not

go to the bad place? Help me, I'm

so scared.

MARK

Well, you didn't know about these

bad things until I told you just

now so you're fine.

MAN #8

(CRYING)

Am I fine?

WOMAN #5

(CRYING)

What about me?

MARK

You're all fine! I'm only talking

about people who do bad things

starting right now. Everyone else

is fine.

88.

MARK

(READING)

Number seven: The man in the sky

who controls everything decides if

you go to the good place or the bad

place. He also decides who lives

and who dies.

MAN #4

Does he cause natural disasters?

MARK

Yes.

WOMAN #3

Did he cause my mom to get cancer?

MARK

Yes.

WOMAN #4

Did he cause that tree to land on

my car last week?

MARK

Yes.

BLUE COLLAR GUY

I say fuck the guy that lives in

the sky!

MAN #5

Yeah! That guy's a fucking asshole!

WOMAN #5

That motherfucker better hope I

never see him face to face!

MAN #6

That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding

up there and doing bad shit to us!

Why doesn't he do it to our faces?

WOMAN #6

We need to stop that motherfucker

before he kills us all!

89.

MARK

(SHOUTING)

WAIT!

MARK

This guy who lives in the sky and

controls everything is also

responsible for all the good stuff

that happens.

MAN #7

He's the guy who saved my life on

that fishing trip when the boat

capsized?

MARK

Yup.

MAN #7

Did he capsize the boat?

MARK

Well, yes.

WOMAN #7

He's the one who killed my

grandmother and left me those

millions of dollars?

MARK

You betcha.

WOMAN #3

So is he the same one who cured my

mom's cancer?

MARK

That too.

MAN #8

So he's kind of a good guy, but

he's also kind of a prick too?

90.

MARK

Right. But check this out:

(CONTINUING)

Number eight: Even if the man in

the sky does bad shit to you, he

makes it up to you by giving you an

eternity of good stuff after you

die.

WOMAN #1

As long as you don't do any of the

bad stuff you listed, right?

MARK

Right. Of course.

WOMAN #2

So it's kind of a test?

MARK

Yes. Right.

(PAUSE)

Well, that's it. That's everything

I know.

NURSE #1

How do you know these things?

MARK

(THINKING)

The man in the clouds told me.

NURSE #1

Yeah, but how come we're just

learning these things now, millions

of years into our existence?

MARK

I don't know, he forgot or

something. I gotta go people, good

night!

91.

MARK

You think that went well?

FADE TO:

92.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARK

So then the flying duck flew all

the way to Alaska where it met up

with a polar bear who could talk.

And the polar bear's name was

Martin. And the polar bear was

wearing a green cape. And Martin

and the flying duck both had race

cars with their names printed on

the side and...

JENNIFER

I just saw three people climbing

the fence into your backyard. You

really need to think about getting

better security.

(noticing beer cans

EVERYWHERE)

Mark, how many of those have you

had?

MARK

(continuing; glaring at

JENNIFER)

But then the evil goblin witch came

in and stole the flying duck's race

car and made the flying duck very

angry.

(grabbing at his beer)

(MORE)

93.

MARK (cont'd)

Luckily the Polar Bear was there to

snatch the race car back...

(But he misses)

Unfortunately, the witch was a

smart witch and the polar bear was

powerless.

ASSISTANT

Is that the end?

MARK

Yeah.

ASSISTANT

That's a strange ending.

MARK

Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man

in the Sky's story.

ASSISTANT

You want me to take this over to

Lecture Films?

MARK

Yeah. Tell them to shoot that one

this week.

MARK

(YELLING)

Tell them it's for kids!

MARK

What?

JENNIFER

You haven't left the house in

weeks. Every time I come by you're

just sitting here writing down

stories you get from the Man in the

Sky.

MARK

Hey, he's the boss.

JENNIFER

Don't you think you should go

outside sometime? You know there's

about five thousand people on our

lawn waiting to ask you questions.

94.

MARK

Yeah, yeah.

JENNIFER

What's with you? You seem sad.

JENNIFER

I don't get it. You're a very

successful writer, you've won

countless awards and Oscars...

JENNIFER

You've changed the way people see

the world, the way they see death

and life. You've made the entire

world happy.

MARK

Not the entire world.

JENNIFER

I know. Not you. The one person who

should be happy, the person who has

everything...

MARK

(INTERRUPTING)

Not everything.

JENNIFER

What else do you want?

MARK

I'd trade it all in for you. All of

it.

JENNIFER

Well, you've got me. As a friend.

MARK

(not sarcastic)

Yeah. That's important.

(MORE)

95.

MARK (cont'd)

But why can't we be together. Why

can't you be with me?

JENNIFER

Because of the whole snub nosed

thing. With kids, your genetics.

You know, fat, short...

MARK

(stopping her)

Yeah. Okay. Yup.

(PAUSE)

It's almost a shame that being rich

and powerful and famous doesn't

change your genetics.

JENNIFER

What?

MARK

It would be great if it changed

your genetic material because I

really love you but I just don't...

MARK

It does change your genetics.

JENNIFER

Does it?

MARK

No. No, it doesn't. Our kids would

be short and fat with little snub

noses.

JENNIFER

Right. Too bad.

(PAUSE)

Anyway, I've come to tell you I

can't go to the movies with you

tonight.

MARK

Why not?

JENNIFER

I've got a date.

96.

MARK

What? With who?

JENNIFER

Rob Marlowe.

MARK

You've got to be fucking... Rob

Marlowe?!? He's a complete and

total asshole.

JENNIFER

Not to me. He's very sweet and kind

to me.

MARK

Well of course he is, look at you.

I mean, for fuck's sake, a shark

would be nice to you...

JENNIFER

It would?

MARK

Well no, I mean...

(PAUSE)

Don't go out with him.

JENNIFER

Why not? He's a great match for me.

MARK

What's he got that I don't?

JENNIFER

We talked about this. If you and I

got together it wouldn't be fair to

our kids. They have the right to be

attractive and have good genes.

(PAUSE)

If Rob and I get married You can

move into our mansion with us when

we all die.

MARK

I don't want to move into your

fucking mansion. And what are you

doing thinking about marriage with

him already? You haven't even gone

on one date.

97.

MARK

It's like nothing's changed.

JENNIFER

A lot of things have changed. I

wish you could be happy.

JENNIFER

That's him. Gotta go.

MARK

He's picking you up here?

JENNIFER

It was his idea.

ROB

What's up? Wow, I can't wait to

have sex with you.

ROB

Oh hey there, Mark. You look like

trash.

(to Jennifer)

Come on Jennifer, let's go have

some fun. And then have some sex.

JENNIFER

I'll call you tomorrow.

GREG

Who was that?

98.

MARK

Hey, watch this.

(yelling over the fence)

HEY PEOPLE!

MARK

The man in the sky just told me

something!

MARK

You're all gay!

MARK

And adopted!

GREG

I don't know why we're laughing.

It's really probably very sad for

those people.

MARK

I'm gettin' a beer.

MARK

Out of beer. Just Coke.

MARK

I want to do something big again.

Like telling the people what

happens when they die. That felt

good. I gotta do something big like

that again.

99.

GREG

Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell

you something new.

MARK

Maybe.

GREG

Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I

really shouldn't drink this.

MARK

Hey, Greg. What if I told you that

drinking Coke was good for you?

MARK

And not just Coke. But all the

delicious foods you're not supposed

to eat. What if they were all of a

sudden really, really good for you?

GREG

It would be the happiest day of my

life.

CUT TO:

100.

MARK

Gentleman, thank you all for coming

here on such short notice. I have

some very big news for you all

today.

EXECUTIVE #1

Is it from the Man in the Sky?

MARK

Nope, this one I came up with all

on my own. And it's going to change

the way you all do business...

forever.

MARK

Up until now, all products sold

worldwide have warning labels

printed on them. Warnings like

these.

MARK

As you can see, a lot of these

products can be very depressing.

They remind people of all the

horrible things that can happen to

them in life. People hate thinking

about horrible things.

EXECUTIVE #2

Yeah, but they have to know those

things.

(MORE)

101.

EXECUTIVE #2 (cont'd)

They have to be able to protect

themselves.

I don't want to hurt anyone.

Especially now that I know about

the "bad place".

MARK

Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to

introduce you to the future of your

companies.

EXECUTIVE #3

Where can I get some of that

healthy coke?

MARK

It's the same Coke as before.

EXECUTIVE #4

But this one is healthy! And it

tastes great!

EXECUTIVE #1

Do you have any samples?

MARK

Guys, it's the same Coke on the

inside. I've just changed the

outside.

EXECUTIVE #1

(REVELATION)

Somehow by changing the outside,

he's also changed the inside!

EXECUTIVE #2

Oh, thank goodness. I've always

hated flying!

EXECUTIVE #3

Me too!

102.

EXECUTIVE #4

What an invention! How did you do

it?

MARK

I didn't do anything, guys. I made

this on my computer last night. The

plane is exactly the same as it was

before.

EXECUTIVE #1

That's the only plane I'll ever fly

on again!

MARK

That's the point here guys. With

these new advertising strategies,

people will buy your products with

abandon.

EXECUTIVE #2

But it will take years to replace

all of our stock with these new

improved products you've invented.

MARK

No. It won't. All you have to do is

print these words on the packaging.

That's it.

MARK

Even if you don't understand it,

just start shipping these products

out to people as you see them here

and you're all going to get very,

very rich.

EXECUTIVE #3

How did you do it?

MARK

Look, they're still the same

products you have on the shelves

right now. The only difference now

is that people won't get bummed out

or scared when they use them. Isn't

that a good thing?

103.

MARK

Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, I

have five thousand gay orphans on

my front lawn that are going

bananas.

DISSOLVE TO:

104.

FAT MAN

Thank the Man in the Sky for this.

I've never been happier in my life.

Now I can eat whatever I want,

whenever I want.

REPORTER

Are you all right, sir?

FAT MAN

Yeah. I must just be real happy. It

says on the wrapper that they help

boost your happiness.

MARK

You should slow down there, Greg.

GREG

Why's that?

MARK

Just because the package says it's

not bad for you doesn't mean you

have to gorge yourself on it.

GREG

But it tastes so good.

MARK

That's just stupid.

GREG

No it's not.

GREG

See?

105.

GREG

You look sad. Here, have a brownie.

They'll cheer you up.

MARK

I wish that worked for me, Greg.

GREG

What?

MARK

Nevermind. I'll see you around.

BUSINESS MAN

I'm not talking to anyone on my

cell phone. But from a distance I

look very important and busy.

GIRLFRIEND

No, I won't move into your mansion

with you when we die. You're really

smothering me.

BOYFRIEND

The more you push me away, the more

attracted I am to you.

106.

HONKING MAN

Move it, fatty!

HONKING MAN

Hey you're Mark Bellison!

MARK

Yeah. So are you going to

apologize?

HONKING MAN

For what?

MARK

Nothing's really changed. I gave

people the Man in the Sky, made

myself rich and successful, told

the world they can eat whatever

they want and feel good about it.

Everyone's happy but me. Because

I'm the only one who knows it

all... isn't. I made it all up.

(PAUSE)

You're not up there living in a

mansion. You're right here. In the

ground. That's all. And I'm the

only one who knows that.

(PAUSE)

And the one thing I want I can't

have. Because the world is too

stupid to change. The world only

cares about what they can see, and

what they can know, and what

they're used to and what... makes

sense. No one listens to what they

really want. And that's why I'll

always just be a loser, grandma.

And that's why I'll always be

alone.

FADE TO:

107.

MARK

Who's there?

JENNIFER (O.S.)

It's me. Can I come in?

MARK

Sure.

MARK

Haven't seen you much lately.

JENNIFER

I know. I've been busy with work

and things. And I'm getting

married. That's why I came over.

To tell you.

MARK

Don't do it.

JENNIFER

The wedding is tomorrow.

JENNIFER

I hope you'll come.

MARK

No point really.

108.

JENNIFER

It would make me happy. Being

around you makes me happy.

MARK

So don't marry him.

JENNIFER

I only have a few years to marry

someone with good genes and

financial stability so I can have

children and the family I've always

wanted. One day I'll be old and

wrinkly and ugly.

MARK

No you won't. Not to me you won't.

I love you. If you really love

someone it doesn't matter what they

look like.

JENNIFER

What do you mean?

MARK

Do me this favor. Just one favor.

Don't accept everything you see.

Don't just do something because

that's the way it's done.

JENNIFER

You're confusing me.

MARK

Think about what you want. Find out

what you really want. And if it's

not the same as what I want, well

then I'll know that and I'll never

darken your doorstep again.

(PAUSE)

I want you. What do you want?

JENNIFER

I'm going to go.

MARK

Please don't. Will you just stay a

little bit longer? I don't want to

be alone. Just sit with me.

109.

JENNIFER

(READING)

My invention.

DISSOLVE TO:

GREG

We're gonna be late.

GREG

Makes sense people would start

getting married at these places. I

mean, who you marry decides who's

mansion you're going to live in one

day. It's a big decision.

110.

MARK

Yeah.

JENNIFER'S MOTHER

It's time, dear.

JENNIFER'S MOTHER

Jennifer?

JENNIFER

I don't feel all right.

JENNIFER'S MOTHER

What's wrong? Do you have food

poisoning?

JENNIFER

No. I don't think there's a word

for what I have.

111.

WEDDING OVERSEER

We are sitting here in this

building today to share in the

wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two

young, attractive people who have

agreed that this union would be

mutually beneficial and that their

genetic match-up would most likely

produce favorable offspring and a

life of financial stability and

physical security.

WEDDING OVERSEER

Rob, do you promise to stay with

Jennifer for as long as you want to

and to protect your offspring for

as long as you can?

ROB

I do.

WEDDING OVERSEER

Jennifer, do you promise to stay

with Rob for as long as you want to

and to protect your offspring for

as long as you can?

WEDDING OVERSEER

Jennifer?

JENNIFER

(to Overseer)

I'm sorry, hold on one second.

(to Rob)

Rob, can I ask you something?

ROB

(CONCERNED)

Sure. But what are you doing?

JENNIFER

What color are my eyes?

112.

ROB

I dunno...

(LOOKING)

Oh, they're brown.

JENNIFER

No Rob, they're blue.

ROB

Oh, look at that. So they are.

You've got pretty blue eyes.

ROB

Can we get on with this?

WEDDING OVERSEER

Jennifer, do you promise to stay

with Rob for as long as you want to

and to protect your offspring for

as long as you can?

JENNIFER

I do.

WEDDING OVERSEER

Before I pronounce these two man

and wife, is there anyone here who

thinks they'd offer either of these

people a better genetic match-up?

MARK

Me.

ROB

Oh come on. Look at you. You can't

be better.

113.

MARK

Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.

ROB

Schmuck genes? What's that?

MARK

And I love her.

(to Jennifer)

Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this

what you really want?

JENNIFER

I don't know.

(pause; unsure)

Yes?

MARK

All right. I'm done. Goodbye.

ROB

Are we married yet? Because I've

got plans this afternoon.

JENNIFER

(SHOUTING)

Hold on a minute!

MARK

What?

JENNIFER

I'm confused.

114.

MARK

So am I.

JENNIFER

Is any of it... the things you

said... are they... I can't think

of the word.

(PAUSE)

Is there a Man in the Sky?

MARK

No.

JENNIFER

Why'd you say there was?

MARK

Because I couldn't cope with the

look on my grandmother's face.

JENNIFER

But how could you say something

that... wasn't.

MARK

I'm not sure. I just did it.

JENNIFER

And what did you mean that I could

grow old and ugly and still be

beautiful to you?

MARK

I mean just that. You'll always be

beautiful to me.

JENNIFER

But what if my looks...

MARK

It doesn't matter.

JENNIFER

I feel funny.

MARK

Me too.

(PAUSE)

Everything is so hard. Nothing is

easy anymore.

115.

JENNIFER

I know what I want.

MARK

What?

JENNIFER

I want short, fat kids with little

snub noses.

MARK

(JUBILANTLY)

Easy! That's an easy one.

JENNIFER

Does anyone else know about your

invention?

MARK

No. But I'm sure it won't be long.

JENNIFER

Should we tell them right away?

MARK

I'm not sure. I don't think

everyone will understand.

GREG

What's going on out here?

Everyone's just sitting in there.

Are we gonna finish this wedding?

JENNIFER

Yes.

MARK

Praise the Man in the Sky.

116.

NARRATOR

The world's last moment of honesty.

A monumental occasion in the

history of mankind.

(PAUSE)

That lowly writer who stumbled upon

the ability to lie went on to

become one of the most important

men of his age, married to one of

the most beautiful women of his

time, and passed on the lying gene

to generations to come.

(PAUSE)

A world without honesty is a world

with dreams. A world with pretense.

A world with fiction. A world with

flattery. And most importantly, a

world with true love. Put simply, a

world very much like our own.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
