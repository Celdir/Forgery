Z (O.S.)

(over a dark screen)

All my life, I've lived and worked in

the big city...

soldier ants

matchbox

elevator filled with workers.

Z (V.O.)

...which is kind of a problem, since

I've always felt uncomfortably in

crowds.

Z

I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've

got abandonment issues.  My father

flew away when I was just a larva.

My mother didn't have much time for

me...when you have five million

siblings, it's difficult to get

attention.

(pause)

I feel physically inadequate -- I've

never been able to lift more than ten

times my own weight.  Sometimes I

think I'm just not cut out to be a

worker.  But I don't have any other

options.  I was assigned to trade

school when I was just a

grub

.  The

whole system just...makes me

feel...

insignificant

.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(enthusiastic)

Terrific!  You

should

feel

insignificant!

Z

...I should?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(hopping around

enthusiastically)

YES!!!  You know, people ask me,

"Doctor, why are you always happy?"

And I tell them it's mind over

matter.  I don't

mind

that I don't

matter

!  Do you get it?  Do you get

it?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

(incredibly "up")

Z, we're part of the

fastest growing

species in the whole world

!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Ask me why we're so successful.

Z

Why are we so successful?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

I'm glad you asked me that question!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

What do you see out there?

Z

...Ants...

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,

each with his assigned task, all

pulling together!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

You see?  Being an ant is being able

to say, "Hey --

I'm

meaningless,

you're

meaningless."

Z

But -- but I've always felt life was

about finding meaning...and then

sharing it with someone special,

someone you love.

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Z...you need help.

(looking at a clock)

Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop

there.  Your minute is up!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Now back to work!  We've made

real

progress

!  Remember -- let's be

best superorganism we can be!

gigantic

tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel".

AZTECA

Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap

out of it, or there's gonna be a lot

of pissed off ants!

Z

(snapping out of it)

Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!

Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!

(looking at the dirt)

Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I

mean this dirt is very...dirty.

Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?

(Z's stomach growls)

Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm

seeing double.  It looks like there's

two

million ants in here.  When's

lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?

AZTECA

(sweetly)

Z, old pal...

(shouts)

SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's

a food shortage without you

complaining about it every day.

Z

The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

AZTECA

No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets

thrown

away

, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,

even though you are a pain in my rear-

segment.  I don't wanna see

anything happen to you.  So quit

mouthing off, before you get in

trouble.

Z

Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

AZTECA

(resigned)

Break's over.

Z

(getting back to work)

This colony needs another tunnel like

a hole in the ground.  Why are we

even digging this thing?

AZTECA

Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we

gotta dig.  We're not the ones in

charge.

GENERAL FORMICA

STAIRS!

GENERAL FORMICA

Cut the chit-chat down there!

(turning to Carpenter)

We've spoiled these workers,

Carpenter.  They've never had it so

good, and listen to them -- always

grumbling and complaining...

CARPENTER

...Yes, sir.

GENERAL FORMICA

What have they got to complain about?

Three square meals a day...

CARPENTER

Actually, sir, we've cut them down to

three roughly rectangular meals a

week.

FORMICA

Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.

I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!

FORMICA

(to guard ant, while

passing)

Oil that, soldier.

QUEEN

Ah!  General Formica.

QUEEN

General, the severe food shortage

that faces the colony...

pains

me.

The thought of any of my children

going hungry...

(she shudders; then,

to baby)

Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You

are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to

brush your teeth!

(to mid-wife)

Ship 'er out.

(back to Formica)

What steps are you taking to remedy

the situation?

FORMICA

We are launching a major offensive to

expand our foraging territory...

QUEEN

Yes, what else?

FORMICA

Please don't worry, your majesty.

Leave the worrying to me.  As you

know, I'm not an ant of half-

measures.  I don't pussyfoot around.

This crisis is my number one

priority, and I promise you it's

being dealt with swiftly, and

decisively.

QUEEN

(to baby)

No snacking between meals!  Off you

go!

(to Formica)

Now -- what were we saying?

FORMICA

(Oliver North-style)

I do not recollect, your majesty.

Will that be all?

QUEEN

Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my

good man!  I don't know what we would

do without you.

BALA (O.S.)

General Formica!

CARPENTER

(sotto)

Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

FORMICA

Princess!  You look -- outstanding.

Is there anything I can do for you?

BALA

Well -- I thought -- since we're

getting married...it might be nice if

we...got to know one another.

QUEEN

Bala has always been a hopeless

romantic, General.

BALA

It's just that -- well, I'm honored

that you selected me, and everything,

I just thought the marriage might go

a little more smoothly if -- we had

a conversation?

FORMICA

(uncomfortable)

Conversation...yes...well...

(to Carpenter)

Wasn't she briefed?

QUEEN

(holding up a baby)

Look, General!  A darling baby

soldier!

(emotionally, to baby)

Don't try to be a hero!  Just make

sure you come back in one piece!

(handing it off)

Next!

FORMICA

(using the

interruption)

I'll take your suggestion under

advisement, Princess.  In the

meanwhile --

BALA

General -- we have to talk sometime!

FORMICA

Very well.  Carpenter, is there a

convenient time to talk vis-a-vis:

relationship?

CARPENTER

Actually, sir, we're ahead of

schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds

available right now.

FORMICA

Outstanding.  Princess...?

BALA

So, um...how was your day?  What did

you do?

FORMICA

(scouring his mind)

Well...

(that's it!)

I declared war!

BALA

(sadly)

Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing

in common...

CARPENTER

(under his breath)

Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.

FORMICA

Duty calls!

FORMICA

No squeak.  Outstanding!

QUEEN

(sympathetically)

I felt the same way before I got

married.  Confused.  Scared.

BALA

(hopefully)

You did?

QUEEN

Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted

out all those messy feelings.  The

wonderful thing about ant life is

that everything is arranged.  Even

marriage.  You're lucky -- General

Formica is a paragon of anthood.

BALA

(unconvinced)

Yes...he's wonderful...

HANDMAIDEN #1

(swooning over

General Formica)

The General's body segments are

so...symmetrical.

HANDMAIDEN #2

(giggling)

I'd let him order me into battle

anyday.

HANDMAIDEN #1

Princess?  What's wrong?

BALA

Wrong?  How could anything be wrong?

I'm going to marry General Formica

and be a queen and have millions of

babies, just like my mom.

(concerned)

Do I look fat to you?

HANDMAIDEN #2

(knowingly, to

Handmaiden #2)

Pre-wedding jitters.

HANDMAIDEN #1

You just need to blow off some steam.

Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!

BALA

The Club's so

stuffy

.  I want to try

someplace different.

HANDMAIDEN #2

There isn't anyplace else --

(making a joke)

Except the worker bar.

BALA

The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where

I want to go!

HANDMAIDEN #1

But -- we can't -- there'll be

workers

there.

of ants trying to get a

Z

We declared war again?

(off Weaver's nod)

Are you scared?

WEAVER

(shrugs)

I'll be back.

APHIDS

(as they're slapped

on bar)

Ouch!  Ouch!

BARTENDER

Two aphid beers.

Z

(as Bartender leaves)

Did you see that?  How he gave

you

the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,

he's got something against workers.

WEAVER

I don't know what you're talking

about, Z.

Z

Come on -- everybody dumps on us

workers.  You soldiers get all the

glory.  Plus you get to go out into

the world, meet interesting insects,

and kill them.

WEAVER

Yeah, but you get to spend all day

with those fabulous worker babes.

Z

Weaver, they're career girls.

They're obsessed with digging.

(sighs)

No, I'll probably never meet the girl

for me.

WEAVER

Who said there was a girl for you?

I was talking about a girl for me.

(quaffing his aphid

beer)

Don't you want your aphid beer?

Z

I can't help it.  I have a thing

about drinking from the anus of

another creature.  Call me crazy.

WEAVER

Z, we've known each other a long

time, right?

Z

Of course.  You were born two seconds

after me.

WEAVER

And all the time I've known you,

you've been grumping and groaning.

You should quit making waves.  Go

with the flow.

Z

Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

DRUNK SCOUT

Have

you

been to Insectopia?  Have

you

?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But

I

have...

(becoming emotional)

...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n'

beetles -- all livin' in peace,

stuffin their guts with food...No

rules, no regulations...you can be

your own ant there...

(howling drunkenly)

It's Insectopia!

Insectopia

!

Z

Hey, Weaver, listen!

DRUNK SCOUT

I was cut off from my unit -- found

it by mistake --

(slurring)

It changed my life!

(spraying another

soldier with saliva)

You see -- ya follow the great yellow

egg, and you come to the land of red

and white --

SOLDIERS

You've had enough for one night!

Come on, Gramps, before you get in

trouble.

Z

(excited)

Hey, did you hear what he said?!

WEAVER

Poor guy's had one too many scouting

missions.

HANDMAIDEN #2

We shouldn't be doing this -- it

isn't proper!

BALA

I'm the Princess, aren't I?

HANDMAIDEN #2

Of course --

BALA

And do Princesses do improper things?

HANDMAIDEN #2

Of course not --

BALA

Then if I go to the worker bar, it

isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.

No one will recognize us in our

disguises.

BALA

I'm just a common worker, cooling off

after a rough day!

BARKER

(on loudspeaker)

Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and

that means it's time to dance.

WEAVER

(draining his beer)

Time to cut a rug, Z!

Z

I'm not in the mood.

(disgusted)

Even when they're off work, they

follow orders.

WEAVER

Well, you just sit here and be a

party-pooper.

BARKER

(southern twang)

And a left-right-quarterstep-back

step-halfstep -- a left-right-

quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --

a left-right-quarterstep-backstep

halfstep --

BALA

I'm going to ask one of these

mindless, primitive worker-types to

dance with me!

HANDMAIDEN #1

But General Formica would be furious!

BALA

(enjoying the idea)

I know.

Z

What a bunch of losers.  Mindless

zombies capitulating to an oppressive

system --

BALA

Wanna dance?

instantly smitten

.

Z

Me?!

Yes

!!!  I mean --

(regaining suavosity)

Just let me finish my beer.

Z

So uh -- how come I haven't seen you

around here before?

BALA

(covering up)

I work in the palace, I don't get out

much.

Z

The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals

really live it up.  Of course they're

all a little, you know, from

inbreeding --

BALA

(shocked)

What

?

Z

Now, let's see, I -- it's been a

while since I -- I think you --

Z

Here, I'll lead.

BALA

Are you sure this is a real dance?

Z

Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of

making it up --

BALA

(surprised)

Really?

Z

Why should everyone dance the same

way?  It's as exciting as watching

fungus grow.

BALA

You're right!

Z

(surprised)

You -- you think I'm right?

BALA

Why can't I just do whatever I want

to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!

Yahoo!

too

SOLDIER

Hey!  Watch your step,

worker

.

BALA

You watch yours, soldier, or my

worker friend will beat you up!

Z

(terrified)

Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off

this time.

(whispering to Bala)

Are you crazy?  This guy's built like

a pebble!

(ineptly trying to

placate the soldier)

You know they do great prosthetic

antennas nowadays --

BALA

Aren't you gonna stand up for

yourself?

SOLDIER

How come you don't dance like the

rest of us?

Z

Because -- because I'm an

individual

!

SOLDIER #2

An individual?  Never heard of it.

You look like a worker to me.

Uh oh.

Goodbye!  Gotta run!

Z

Wait!  When can I see you again?

BALA

Let me think.  Hmmnn...

(thinks)

Never.  Bye!

Z

Wait!  Princess!  Wait!

CUT TO:

WEAVER

Get real, Z!  She just dropped the

scarf by accident!

Z

Are you kidding?  There were sparks

between us!  This scarf is a sign!

WEAVER

It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do

you know what the penalty for

impersonating a soldier is?

Z

What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your

place for the royal inspection.  Bala

comes strolling down the line, she

sees me --

bingo

!  Love is rekindled,

and she takes me up to the palace for

a little...

(wags his eyebrows

suggestively)

tea and crumpets... and you take your

place again, and go march around to

your heart's content!

Z

You have to help me.  Please, Weaver.

Think of all the things I've done for

you!

WEAVER

(thinks)

I can't think of any.

Z

(pause)

Well I'm gonna

start

doing things for

you...

WEAVER

Will you introduce me to some worker

girls?

Z

You bet!  They'll really go for a

sensitive guy like you!

WEAVER

Maybe I'll get lucky.

(Weaver thinks about

it)

You know, Z, I wouldn't do this

for anyone but you...

WEAVER

Wear this.

Z

(overjoyed)

You're a real buddy.

WEAVER

(sourly)

Yeah, I know.

Z

What do I do?

WEAVER

Don't tell anyone you're a worker.

Follow that column over there.  And

come right back after the inspection!

Z

(overjoyed)

Thanks!  I owe you!

Z

Any of you guys know when the

Princess will show up?  She's kind of

a personal friend.

FORMICA

First of all, let me make one thing

clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by

thinking for himself

.  All this

"thinking" stuff is a

load of crap

.

If the almighty had wanted you boys

to

think

, he wouldn't have given you

huge mandibles and a brain so small

you'd

misplace it

if it wasn't

trapped inside your head

.

Z

(slapping his thigh)

"Trapped inside your head" -- that's

a good one --

Z

Geez -- tough room.

FORMICA

(striding back and

forth)

We ants survive as a species because

we do what we're told.  We survive

because we work together, as one, we

get the job done, we do whatever it

takes to persevere!

(dramatic pause)

Hell, we're not an army of

ants...we're one

giant

ant, with

giant fists

, and

giant jaws

!

Z

(to the soldier ant

next to him)

Lays it on a little thick, doesn't

he?  If you ask me, he's one giant

bore.

FORMICA

Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt

about a

food shortage

.  Well you boys

are gonna be taken care of.  But in

the meantime we're gonna eat the

enemy for

breakfast

, we are gonna

eat the enemy for

lunch

, and we are

gonna eat the enemy for

dinner

!

Z

Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.

FORMICA

(reflective moment)

Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.

(he looks out at his

army)

And I know each and every one of you

boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!

QUEEN

Darling, you must encourage the

troops -- wave!

Z

(excited)

Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.

Well, it's been fun.  Have a great

war!

Z

Hey!  Wait!

BARBATUS

You new, kid?

Z

I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!

I got a trial membership!

BARBATUS

Trial membership?  Kid, when you join

this ant's army, you're in for the

full hitch.

Z

Wait a minute, there's been a

mistake!  I've got to get back to the

colony!

BARBATUS

Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot

deserters!

BARBATUS

You just stick by old Barbatus.

He'll watch out for you.

(off Z's look)

Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl

behind?

Z

Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of

playing hard to get.  As a matter of

fact, she's playing completely

unattainable.

(nervously)

So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk

walk?  a foraging expedition?

BARBATUS

No -- we're going to attack the

termites!

Z

(alarmed)

Attack?  But -- I hate attacking!

It's so hostile!

ANT SOLDIERS

(to the tune of "When

Johnny Comes

Marching Home")

We ants go marching one by

one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter

termites just for fun, Hurrah!

Hurrah!

Z

So -- these termites, they're little,

shy, retiring insects?

BARBATUS

(grim smile)

No such luck.  Those dirty terms are

five times bigger than us, and they

shoot acid from their foreheads!

SOLDIER ANTS

We ants go marching two by two,

hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead

before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!

Z

Well, what exactly does our platoon

do?  Serve beverages?  Process

paperwork?

BARBATUS

Our platoon has the best assignment

of all.  We're the first into battle!

ANT SOLDIERS

We ants are marching three by three,

hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what

we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!

Z

So we're going back for more armor,

right?  I mean, these guys are from

AZTECA

Tell me about it.

WEAVER

Nobody told me digging was so much

fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move

it, you pick it up again, you move it

Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

FOREMAN

What's the holdup here?!

WEAVER

Sorry, sir -- I was just having a

FOREMAN

Who said you could have a

chat

?

You're not a chatter, you're a

digger!  So shut up and dig!

AZTECA

Leave him alone!  He's new.

You  too?  Well just for that, you

I don't know what came over me,

Sorry I got you in trouble.  But

Are you asking me out to dinner?

AZTECA

It looks like only one soldier made

it back!

WEAVER

(to himself)

Poor Z -- I should never have let you

go!

Z

It was horrible...a massacre, a

massacre upon a massacre.  First we

massacred them, then they massacred

us, then it was halftime.  I've never

seen such violence, such

bloodthirstiness, such bad

manners...I'm the only one that made

it!

FORMICA

ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!

Z

No -- you -- you don't understand!

FORMICA

Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish

I had a hundred ants of your caliber.

The world would tremble.  Now, time

for some R and R.  You're invited to

the royal victory party!

Z

Royal victory party?  Will...will

Princess Bala be there?

FORMICA

Of course.  The entire royal family

will be there to honor you.

Z

(thinks)

ONE TO NOTHING!

AZTECA

Wait a minute, that's no soldier --

that's Z!

WEAVER

Z?

Our

Z?  The little guy made it!

FORMICA

Son, you're an ant after my own

heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks

death right in the face and

laughs

.

Z

Well, I generally just make

belittling comments and snicker

behind death's back.  So, tell me,

fellow war-monger...do you think

Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

FORMICA

Well she better -- she's engaged to

one.

Me

!

Z

Engaged?  As in you're getting

married?

FORMICA

Affirmative.

Z

So...you two are in love?

FORMICA

In love?

(shakes his head)

I'm just a plain old soldier at

heart.  I'll tell you what I love --

the field -- blood -- death --

orders...and the company of other

warriors.

CUT TO:

Z

Wow, what a spread -- you know,

there's a food shortage in the rest

of the colony.

FORMICA

Yes, and do you know

why

there's a

food shortage?

Z

...Not enough food?

FORMICA

Negatory.

Too many ants

.  And while

we soldiers go out there, and fight,

and bleed, and die for the colony,

the namby-pamby workers live it up

back home.

Z

Well I, I don't think "living it up"

is the right term -- how about

"working themselves to death"?

FORMICA

I tell you son, sometimes, at night,

I see myself in battle, fighting a

horrible, faceless enemy, with the

future of our whole species at stake.

And always, the dream ends with each

of us plunging his sword into the

other's heart...

Z

(spooked)

Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see

an old war buddy over there, it's

been fun chatting.  Good luck with

the hallucinations.

OFFICER

(telling a joke)

What do you call it when 10,000

workers are killed in a tunnel cave-

in?

(a beat)

Who cares?  They're workers!

Z

But...don't you think the worker

class is the very foundation of the

colony --

(realizes he's

getting odd looks)

I mean, uh, without them, who would

we stand on?

BALA

You're the hero of the recent termite

campaign, aren't you?

Z

Well, if single-handedly vanquishing

the enemy and slaughtering a whole

nestful of termites makes someone a

hero, yes I am.

Z

(feigning nonchalance)

And you are...?

BALA

I'm Princess Bala.

Z

Ah, yes.

(affected)

Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So,

Princess, have you ever danced with

a hero?

BALA

Yes.

Z

(deflated)

Oh...oh well then, one more won't

matter.

Z

Just warming up...

QUEEN

All these parties are so marvellously

alike

.

FORMICA

They should be...

(suspicious)

But there's something funny about

that soldier.

FORMICA

(glowering)

May I cut in?

Z

(intimidated)

Oh, of course --

BALA

(pulling Z back)

No, General.  I'm dancing with the

war hero.

Z

(trying to placate

Formica)

Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always

had this animal magnetism, it --

BALA

You dance...

Z

Divinely?

BALA

No weirdly...You remind me of

someone...

BALA

He was swarthy...primitive...

earthy...sensual.

BALA

He was a worker.  I danced with him

at a

worker's bar

just the other day.

I'm not shocking you, am I?

Z

(proudly)

No...as a matter of fact...

BALA

(shocked)

OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A

WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid,

disgusting WORKER!

Z

Gee, uh, could you say it a little

louder, I think there are some ants

in the next colony who didn't hear

you.

BALA

I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!

Z

(offended)

That's not what you said the

other

night

--

BALA

(now she's panicked)

Quiet -- sshhh!!

Z

(digging it in)

-- At the

worker bar

!  You were

pretty hot to trot then!

BALA

SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

FORMICA

(furious)

What's this?  A

worker

has been

masquerading as a war hero?!

Z

Well it wasn't a masquerade, really,

it was more what I'd call a clever

ruse --

FORMICA

ARREST HIM!

Z

Can't we all settle this like

adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!

Alright, alright, I'll try to get

Excuse me, I --

he tries the next)

Pardon me --

And they call them social insects.

BALA

BALA

I've been kidnapped by the village

Z

Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot

who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who

lets herself get kidnapped by the

idiot?

BALA

How dare you speak to me like that?

I'm the Princess!

Z

Theoretically, yes.  But is the

monarchical hierarchy applicable

without the underlying social

structure to support it?

BALA

Of course!  It defines society!  To

deny the precept is to say that order

is an arbitrary distinction applied

by the society itself!

Z

But can there be a society composed

of just two ants?

BALA

No!  There's no such thing as "just

two ants."  You never see just two

ants -- you see a million ants!

Z

Look around, sweetheart.

BALA

I --

hate

-- you.

Z

Well I guess that makes us even.

BALA

Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're

crazy about me!  That's why you lied

and cheated to get near me!

Z

Oh come on,

you're

the one who came

after me -- the swarthy, earthy,

sensual worker!

BALA

(repulsed)

I was

slumming it

!  I danced with you

because you were the most pathetic

specimen in the place!

Z

Is that the same standard you used to

choose General Formica?

BALA

I

didn't

choose him.  What kind  of

idiot

would...

(unconvincingly)

...

choose

who she wanted to marry?

BALA

Now, worker, you shall take me back

to the colony, and have your head cut

off and stuck on a sharp pole!

Z

Well, that's an appealing offer,

but...considering the options...

(he decides)

You go back.  Me, I'm going to

Insectopia.

BALA

Insectopia

?  You stupid worker,

that's just a fairy tale!

Z

Yeah, well I have it on a reliable

source...

(he knows that was

maybe stretching it)

that it exists.  Now you follow

I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'

yelled at.

WORKER #1

What do you want, we're just workers.

WEAVER

You know, you're not just workers --

you can be whatever you want to be!

Look at Z!  He started as a worker --

then he became a soldier!

AZTECA

That's right!  He slaughtered

hundreds of termites single-handedly!

WORKER #2

I heard about this guy.

(turning to the other

workers)

He crashed a party at the palace.

Then he took a hike with one of the

royal babes!  And when they tried to

stop him, he just

looked

at a

couple'a guards, and they burst into

flames!

WORKER ANT #1

You're nuts, how could a worker do

all that?

WEAVER

Well, because he's more than a

worker...he's a...what did he call

it, Azteca...

AZTECA

Invisible!

WEAVER

No -- an

WORKER #2

What's

that

WEAVER

Well, it's...someone with his own

point of view...someone who does what

he wants, not whatever he's told to

do!

AZTECA

(eyes lit up,

watching Weaver)

Someone who follows his heart!

WEAVER

(taking Azteca's hand)

No one should have to.  Have him

So this Z...he fancies himself an

WEAVER

Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know,

you?

Oh, no, sir!

Good.  You're a good soldier.

Thank you, sir.

FORMICA

So tell me.  Where's Z?

WEAVER

I...I have no idea, sir.

FORMICA

Okay, son.

FORMICA

We know what makes an ant colony

strong, don't we?  We know that no

ant can be an individual.  No

single

ant matters, right?

That's correct, sir!

Insectopia, hunh?...See why

individuality is so dangerous?  It

can always be used against you.

If this sissy here wants to dig,

he'll dig.  Send them both back to

Because...because he's

I'm an

married, it'll be to someone

I

choose.

FORMICA

(shaking his head)

Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old

soldier, and the ways of the feminine

mind are a little too complex for me.

But one thing I do know is, there are

more Princesses where you came from.

I just hope they're not all like you.

In the meantime, maybe we can arrange

for you to see Z again after all.

Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect,

you're alright by me.

Z

Thanks, Chip.

Z

(to himself)

How am I going to get in?  The place

is crawling with soldiers!

SOLDIER ANT

You there!  Worker!

Z

Don't bite!  I surrender!

SOLDIER ANT

What are you doing out here!  All

workers are to remain inside the

colony, by orders of General Formica!

Z

(heading inside)

Well...if you insist...

QUEEN

Very impressive, General.

hundreds of thousands

of workers are crowded,

MANDIBLE

Wave that flag, you maggot!

FORMICA

Is there anything wrong, your majesty?

QUEEN

It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish

she were here for this special moment.

FORMICA

(falsely supportive)

She is, your majesty.

She is

Z

Geez, this place really empties out

in August.  Where is everybody?

TRACKER ANT

(sniffing)

Z!  Z!  I smell Z!

Z

You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've

been out in the wilderness for a

while, and --

Z

(getting it)

Hey, wait, you're...you're one of

those pheremone sniffers, aren't you?

Maybe you can help me...I'm looking

for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.

TRACKER ANT

Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find

Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!

Just remember, I met her first.

Great.  More digging.  This is why I

left in the first place.

Bala!

BALA

Z!  You came back!

Z

Why do they have you tied up here?

BALA

There's something going on, Z --

BALA

They're having a ceremony to open the

Megatunnel...

Z

Bala, that -- that lake we found --

I think the tunnel's right underneath

it!

(horrified)

-- Formica's going to

flood the

colony

!!!  That's what he meant when

said there were too many ants!

BALA

Oh no...

BALA

Z!  what are you doing?

Z

I know it's crazy, but -- I can't

just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If

I've learned anything, it's that the

problems of two people don't add up

to a hill of ants in this world.  Or

beans.  Something like that.  Anyway,

I've

got to warn the others

.

Z

Head for the surface, Bala.  If I

don't make it, well...we'll always

have Insectopia.

BALA

(following him)

Z!!! Wait for me!

FORMICA

Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of

state keep me from attending the

ceremony.

QUEEN

But General -- this tunnel is your

baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

FORMICA

'Fraid not, your majesty.

(with regret)

Goodbye, your majesty.

QUEEN

Very well, General -- I know you --

all work and no play!

FORMICA

Alright, let's move out!

QUEEN

In the name of the colony, I declare

this tunnel open!

Z

Stoooooop!

QUEEN

Bala!

BALA

Mom!

Z

Listen up!  We've all got to get out

of here!  This place is going to

flood!

WORKER #1

Are you

nuts

?

Z

You've got to believe me!

WORKER #2

Oh yeah?  What makes you so special,

Mr. Know-It-All?

Z

I'm Z.

WORKER #3

You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten

milimeters tall!

WORKER #4

-- and he can kill termites with his

bare hands!  You're just some scrawny

worker with a mental problem!

Z

I

am

Z!

WORKER #1

No you're not!

WEAVER

Yes he is

.

Z

Weaver!

WORKERS

Hey...it

is

Z...listen to what he

says! [etc].

WEAVER

Z...I'm so sorry!  I --

Z

Don't worry about it, pal.

QUEEN

(distastefully)

Oh...it's that social-climbing worker

again -- what does he want?

Z

(in response)

To save you all!  Now we've got to go!

Dig

Z

We've got to dig a trench around us!

WORKER #1

Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're

individuals.

WORKER #2

Yeah.  We're too important to dig.

You taught us that, Z.  You hate

digging!

Z

(at his wits end)

Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now

You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the

Okay boys -- take her up!

WORKER

He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!

FORMICA

Z.  I should have known.  All that

work, all that preparation, come to

nothing.  All because of one stinking

ant.

FORMICA

ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?

FORMICA

WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU,

WHERE'S Z?

FORMICA

Folks, you may have survived that

flood, but there's

no way

you're

gonna escape from

me

.  I'll make you

a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader

Z, and you survive.

FORMICA

But if you don't hand him over,

you're

all

going to die, each and

every single..."individual" one of

you.

FORMICA

What shall it be, workers?

FORMICA

Have it your way.

Z

Wait...

Z

...I'm Z.

WEAVER

No,

I'm

Z.

AZTECA

I'm

Z!

BALA

No,

I'm

Z.

WORKERS

I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my

brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!

QUEEN

(regally)

We

are Z.

ALL

I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!

FORMICA

ATTACK!

FLY

Hey, guys!

WASP

It's them!

WASP

Are these hooligans giving you

trouble, Z?

FLY

Say the word, Z, and we kick their

butts.

FORMICA

What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!

(berating his army)

Come on, you yellow-bellies!

(turning on Carpenter)

Don't just stand there, Carpenter!

Make an example of yourself!

CARPENTER

Uh, actually, we

are

outnumbered

sir...

FORMICA

AHHHHHHH!!

FORMICA (O.S.)

Help...help me...

FORMICA

Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...

Z

I thought you said that the life of

one ant doesn't matter.

FORMICA

I guess it does...to the ant.

CARPENTER

Sir, if it's any consolation, I still

think you're completely worthless as

an individual.

FADE TO:

Z

So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just

your basic "simple worker overthrows

the government and winds up with the

princess" kind of a story.

You know: there was the big parade

and everything...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Z (V.O.)

General Formica was almost

unemployable.  He eventually got a

gig as a honeydew keg.

Z (V.O.)

The Queen asked me to take over his

job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm

really not the general type.  I'm

more the specific type."  So they

gave the job to Weaver instead.

CUT TO:

Z (V.O.)

Weaver cut the defense budget in

half.  Now we only have an army of

five million.

Z

And me, I guess you could say that I

lived happily ever after.

Z

I mean, I've got the whole package,

right?  A great life, a beautiful

wife, and a few kids.

BALA

A

few

?

Z

Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you

know?  I wouldn't change a thing.
