ON BLACK:

OFFICER (O.S.)

Single file - stay to the right of the

line...

OFFICER

Take your time.  Take a good look.

SAFEWAY CASHIER

Ah, a-are you sure they can't see us?

OFFICER

Two-way mirror, ma'am.

FACTORY WORKER

But they're trained killers.  A guy at

the plant says, "In 'Nam they could

smell ya!"

OFFICER

This is the United States of America,

Sir.

OFFICER (CONT'D)

(into intercom)

Face front.

DIANE

(friendly, to female officer)

I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but is

this going to take long?  It's game

night.

OFFICER

MATCH DISSOLVE WHITE INTO:

FBI AGENT (O.S.)

...a heinous crime has been committed

here...

FBI AGENT

...and testifying in such a case is a

serious matter.  Should you decide your

testimony would jeopardize your personal

safety.

LISA

Look, "Sipowitz", I said I'd tell you

everything - I was just hoping to finish

up before menopause kicks in.

LISA (CONT'D)

(dropping smile)

Let's start with the one who thinks her

shit don't stink.  Diane Weston.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

She's like a goddamn poster child for

high school.

DIANE

(to self in mirror)

Morning, sunshine.  Remember, these are

the best days of your life.

DIANE (CONT'D)

-- so far!

LISA (V.O.)

If I wasn't such a lady, I'd tell you

what a bitch she really is.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

She's the A-squad captain - stole the

title from me.  You should charge her

with that...

DIANE

Hey, Bruce!  You look cute...

BRUCE

(off clothes)

Tommy Hilfiger.  I'm hoping fourth

year's a charm.

LISA

Outta my way, fag.  I'm up.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This really should have been my year.  I

had a lotta work done - I-I mean,

y'know, I'd done a lotta work over the

summer.

DIANE

Lisa?...  Is-is that you?

LISA

(looks straight ahead)

I lost a little weight.

LISA (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You could tell it made her nervous.

DIANE/LISA

Ready?

(pompoms snap to waist)

Okay!

LISA (V.O.)

But they have to, y'know, spread the

talent around, so I've been on the B

squad for four years.

CUT TO:

LISA

Now, the squad as a whole?  They're

closer than Carolina cousins.  Some

people say they're, like, lezbos or

something.  But that's mostly just the

yag-offs in band...

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

...truth is, they're so close - they all

get their monthly visit from "Aunt Rose"

at the same time.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

First, there's Hannah Wold...

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

She's their base.  Strong as an ox.

She's like this Uber-Christian - doesn't

say much.  I mean, if she wasn't kinda

pretty, you'd go, "Hey, who's the tard?"

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then, there's Cleo Miller...

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Number one - not a natural blonde.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I know.  I've been in the locker room

and seen south of the border.  Number

two --

(whispers)

She has to see the school shrink.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLEO

Dreams?  You mean, like, where I'm in

Conan's all leather apartment - I don't

know if he has one, that's why it's a

dream - and suddenly we're buck-naked

and all oiled up.  I don't know where

the oil comes from - again, that's why

it's a dream.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

Cleo's weird, but Kansas Hill - that

girl's crazy.

KANSAS

Son-of-a-blue-balled-bitch!  I always

get this one.

LISA (V.O.)

Mouth on her that could stop a bull in

heat.  Gets her nut-brain from her mom.

See, Mrs. Hill's been in prison since

the day Kansas was born...

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

She was lying there, in labor with

Kansas, when she sees something going on

in the next bed.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Turns out it's Kansas' dad, uh, taking a

nurse's temp.  Stay with me, I'm trying

to be delicate.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

So, Mrs. Hill whips out a shotgun and

blows his ass to kingdom come.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Jury said, because the majority of women

in Lincoln County having babies don't

bring a shotgun, it counted as

premeditation.

LISA (V.O.)

She got life without parole, so Kansas

lives with her grandparents.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then there's Lucy...

LISA (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Geek extraordinaire - a walking left

brain.  She's supposed to have this

genius I.Q.?

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Truth is, she's an obsessive-compulsive

little freak.

DIANE/LISA

Hands in, ladies.

DIANE

Today, we're going to cheer loud, jump

high, and look pretty because --

DIANE/SQUAD

CHEER-LEADERS-KICK --

DIANE

Now let's get going - because nobody

ever got ahead by sitting on their

behind!

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

LISA (V.O.)

The school year started off like normal.

Principal Smith gave his pep talk --

PRINCIPAL SMITH

(reading from a list)

... and if you are approached to buy

drugs, let someone you trust know.  If

you are thinking of harming yourself or

others, let someone know.  If it burns

when you urinate, have milky seepage or

are being touched by an uncle - let

someone know...

LISA (V.O.)

The A-squad performed...

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Now, I know it's my duty to give you all

the facts, so I have to say that their

cheer blew like a bulimic after

Christmas dinner.  Their blatant

disregard for National High School

Cheerleading Association rules made me

sick.  "Basket toss flips and wolf wall

pyramids over two people high are

strictly prohibited."  I made a complete

report and sent it in.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And finally, the football team was

introduced.

PRINCIPAL SMITH (O.S.)

Transferring from Truman High, the new

star quarter back of our mighty Fightin'

Logs!

LISA (V.O.)

That's when Jack and Diane met.  Nobody

saw it coming...

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Especially not Jack...

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He fell for her hard.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Jack was fine - oh man, was he fine.  It

was like he was a bar of chocolate and

the whole school was on the rag -

everyone wanted a piece of him...

DIANE

Jack Bartlett... Jack Bart-lett... Jack

Bar-t-lett.

DIANE

... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack

Bartlett interested in me?

HANNAH

(nervous)

I-I'm sorry - can someone else please

run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's

wrong and it goes against the teachings

of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

KANSAS

Hannah, in order to get real answers

from the netherworld, you've gotta have

a Christian virgin run the board.  Your

kind is pure of heart - the devil won't

dick with you.

HANNAH

(looking down)

Well technically, I don't think I'm a

virgin anymore.

HANNAH (CONT'D)

Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm

pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.

KANSAS

Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that

starts with "at church camp" ain't

leading to the big "O."

CLEO

That's not true.  Those pictures of

Christ - all sweaty and bare-chested on

the cross - always kinda made me hot.

KANSAS

Anyway, last time I checked, you still

had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And

I know she ain't seen the lord on all

fours - so I'm just saying.

DIANE

Well, I want to know what happened --

HANNAH

Okay, one night, around sunset, I went

horseback riding with the nuns.  They

went every night.  And, well, we're

trotting pretty hard, y'know?  The hard

leather saddle, pounding between my

legs...

CLEO

I just got a little squishy...

HANNAH

All of a sudden, I feel... I feel... I

feel just super alive...

(whispering)

"down there."  I swear I thought it was

the second coming.

KANSAS

Nope.  Sounds more like the first.

DIANE

(taking the hand-piece)

I'll just ask the question myself... "Is

Jack Bartlett interested in me?"

FOOTBALL PLAYER #1

You do the bondo yourself?

JACK

Yeah.

FOOTBALL PLAYER #2

Sure-is-sweet.

FOOTBALL PLAYER #1

What'll she do?

JACK

Never opened her up.

FOOTBALL PLAYER #2

S-weet.

JACK

Who was the girl who kicked me in the

head yesterday?

FOOTBALL PLAYER #1

Diane Weston.

FOOTBALL PLAYER #2

Now she sure is sweet.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

Look, I'll be honest with you.  Most of

us realized we didn't have a whore's

chance in heaven with Jack the day of

candidate speeches.

GEEKY GUY

As the A.V. Club candidate, I think, for

the first time in fifty years, we should

say --

(nervous)

NO to a football player as king!

GEEKY GUY (CONT'D)

Vote brains over braun!

LISA (V.O.)

It was the first time most of us even

heard Jack speak.

JACK

Whoa...Thanks, uh - WOW.  Uh, hey,

alright...okay, uh --

LISA (V.O.)

We weren't disappointed.

JACK

Guys!  Hey, guys!  Shut up a minute.

JACK (CONT'D)

Well, uh, I think it just really rocks

that the football team picked me as

their, y'know, uh, candidate.

FEMALE VOICES

We love you, Jack!

JACK

Hey, well, I love you lunch ladies!

JACK (CONT'D)

I just want to say that there are only

three things I want in life - to someday

become a senator of this great state...

JACK (CONT'D)

I want to lead the Lincoln High Fightin'

Logs to victory at the homecoming game --

JACK (CONT'D)

Okay, okay... Uh, and I... I want to go

to the homecoming dance with Diane

Weston.

LISA (V.O.)

Ucht!  They were like friggin' Barbie

and Ken, but without the pink, remote

control Corvette.  Overnight people were

going, like --

SMASH CUT TO:

LISA (V.O.)

"Oh, they're the perfect couple!"

SMASH CUT TO:

LISA (V.O.)

"They're so cuuuuuuuuute!"

LISA (V.O.)

I'm sure it gave the internet whacks

something to talk about besides Agent

Scully and their most recent wet dream.

SMASH CUT TO:

LISA (V.O.)

Now, I'm not one to gossip, but I think

Jack and Diane got so close so fast

because they discovered how much they

both loved...

LISA (V.O.)

Now, right about here's where the real

shit started to hit the fan... Don't

worry - I'll clean this up a bit if I

have to appear in court -- especially if

we're on "Court TV."

INT. DIANE'S SPLIT-LEVEL - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

DEEDEE

Well, there's a Christmas card.

DENNIS

Come in, come in...

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Say Jack, why don't you go light a fire

under Diane.

JACK

I'm on it, Mr. Weston.

DEEDEE

Oh - say, where're my manners.  I'm

DeeDee - you can remember me because of

my double "D's."

DENNIS

And I'm Diane's Dad, Dennis.  Do not try

that after one of my Screwdrivers!

DEEDEE

(recovering)

Whoooo - now who wants some pigs-in-a

blanket?

DIANE

Hi, Jack.

JACK

Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane?

We're supposed to go to the homecoming

dance tonight.

LISA (V.O.)

I obviously wasn't there the night they

all met, but it was probably a super

goober fest.

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

(mocking DeeDee's voice)

"Your Jack's one heck of a good football

player."

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

(mocking Jack's Dad's voice)

"I don't know how he can concentrate

with your lovely Diane cheering on the

sidelines?!"

LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

"Ha, ha, ha, ha..." Ucht!

JACK

Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  I have an

announcement.

JACK (CONT'D)

Me and Diane, uh... we decided we're

going to get married.

DEEDEE

Oh, oh, mother of the bride - I'm

allowed!

DIANE

But not before... I have our baby.

SMASH CUT TO:

DIANE

... so when your dad said, "I never want

to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you

think he meant forever or just until

your mom wakes up?

JACK

I don't know... And what the hell was

that sound she made right before she hit

the coffee table.

DIANE

Well, if I had to guess...

(convincing self)

I'd say that was the sound of a mother

saying good-bye to her little boy and

hello to a young man who's going to be a

daddy of his own...

(getting an idea, cradling his

face)

Jack, do you know what I see here?

JACK

Spit from your dad?

DIANE

(wiping his hair)

I see a flower.  And y'know, even the

most beautiful flowers still grow from

dirt.

JACK

Yeah.

DIANE

So, while we're knee deep in right now -

and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the

long run, we're going to grow strong

from this.

JACK

Y'think?

DIANE

I sure do.

JACK

(trust and love in his eyes)

Diane, I've loved you ever since I first

saw you -- right before you kicked me in

the head.

DIANE

(touched)

Oh, Jack...

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

Diane must've told her squad that night.

DIANE

(in last stall)

No thanks - don't need one.

DIANE (CONT'D)

(looking at everyone a beat)

So...

LISA (V.O.)

I'm sure they were thrilled.  I mean, if

Diane said jump, they'd say "Double

Dutch," "Shoot the Moon," or "Split

Russian?"

CLEO

Holy shit.

LUCY

You just became a statistic!

KANSAS

(suddenly happy)

Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!

HANNAH

But you're not married.

CLEO

Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or

you were pregnant... You had it, threw

it out and you're gonna go back and

dance all night!

KANSAS

Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need

for an abortion?

HANNAH

(suddenly freaked)

What?!  No!  Not an abortion!  My church

can arrange for you to go to Oregon and

take care of a "sick aunt" for nine

months.  Then they put your baby good

home and you come back - a little dazed

and puffy - but everything's fine!  Oh

please, Di, don't be a whore and a

murderer!

LISA (V.O.)

Jack told the team that night, too.

CUT TO:

JACK

Hey, guys?  Uh, I got Diane pregnant.

FOOTBALL PLAYER #1

What?!  Well - all right!

FOOTBALL PLAYER #2

You nailed Diane Weston?  I'd never wash

my Johnson again!

HANNAH

I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane.

I just hear it so much at church - it

kinda came flying out of my head.

DIANE

I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to

get an abortion.  I mean, I always

planned to get married and have kids -

I'm just going a little out of order.

Kinda reminds me of another young lady

who found herself "with child,"

unmarried, on a long road, with no place

to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long

time ago.  But no matter what, she held

her head high and said... "Pappa don't

preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa

don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my

baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby."

The great one...

DIANE (CONT'D)

(with reverence)

Madonna.

KANSAS

We're here for you, Diane.

LISA (V.O.)

I guess their little fairy tale could've

ended there, "And they lived happily

ever after."  Only problem was...

(with great joy, laughing)

they didn't have a place to live!

DISSOLVE TO:

LOAN OFFICER

I'm sorry.

DIANE

What?!  But all our paperwork's there.

My school records, Jack's football

records...

LOAN OFFICER

Let me explain something...

DIANE

No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my

heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in

my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!

LOAN OFFICER

Uh, yes.  Yes you did.

JACK

Diane.  Hold on a minute.  I think I

know where this is going.

(sotto, to loan officer)

I'm willing to put up the papers for my

Mustang - she's got a few miles on her,

but she looks great.

LOAN OFFICER

I'm sure, son, but --

JACK

Okay!  Stop twisting my arm!  I'll throw

in the speakers.

LOAN OFFICER

Look, kids, why don't you just have your

parents come i n and get a loan?  Then

they could give you the money.

DIANE

(building from a slow burn)

With all due respect, Jack and Diane

Bartlett...

DIANE (CONT'D)

...do not accept charity.  We are two

young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not

want a handout.  We want a hand-up.

Give us food and we will be hungry

tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you

plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own

food and... and, uh, then cut it, and -

uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're

interested in giving us a home loan, I

will sit back down.  If not, have a nice

day, Ma'am.

LOAN OFFICER

Sorry.  My hands are tied.

JACK

(watching proudly)

DISSOLVE TO:

DIANE

Well... it's a little more than we

wanted to spend, but we'll take it!

APARTMENT MANAGER

Fine.  Just remember, I manage the

building.  I don't, like, own it or fix

it.  So, like, I don't care if shit

breaks.  All I care is that the rent is

shoved under my door on the first.  Oh,

and if there's, like, packages outside

my door?  Leave 'em the hell alone.

SMASH CUT TO:

Welcome to Burger Bin.

TED

Uh, are, uh, you-you're Jack Bartlett,

JACK

Yeah.

TED

You'd be, like, hangin' out with us

JACK

Yeah - well, after football practice.

Football practice - fantasmic.

Hey, Di, if we have a girl, we should

dress her like Little Debbie!

DIANE

Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.

JACK

(positively giddy)

But Di, all this food reminds me of how

much I want to teach our baby.

JACK (CONT'D)

Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain

Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your

mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for

kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I

guess they're for me."  But your baby

brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops

are, like, a million times better.  I'm

going to save our kid all that pain.

DIANE

I love this lady!

DIANE

Jack, I think I should get a job.

JACK

But we agreed your job is running the

baby machine...

DIANE

I know, but that was before.

Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby

machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and

get a place in line.

Hey, Di!

JACK (CONT'D)

Hello, I'm the little professor.

Wouldn't it be cute if ours looked like

HECKLER

Hey, Bartlett, pick up your skirt when

you run!

KANSAS

(yelling to heckler)

Run, you bastard, run!  She's hormonal!!

JACK

...she's in my hands, right?  Moist to

the touch.  It's at that moment I think

I control her - she's mine.  But it's a

false illusion, like in "Backdraft."  No

man controls fire!  She's ready, I'm

ready, she's ready, I yell, "One-fifty

four, forty eight."

JACK (CONT'D)

Oh, me-me-me, mine's great.

Okay.  Jack, y'know how you and Diane...

Well now that you can't, y'know, (fuck)

"sleep together," but you still sleep

just, super horny?  If so, how horny?

I'll be quiet now so I can listen to

your answer.

LISA

Yeah, Jack - I'd love to hear your

answer.

JACK

The answer's easy...

Oh, "Lolita" is due tomorrow - Same for

she needs a sitz bath --

DIANE

(putting down her Snickers)

Look, I might be moody.  I might be

gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think

about it.  In school, they tell us,

"Dreams can come true."  Right?

DIANE (CONT'D)

But they don't tell us how!  Well,

thanks to Keanu, I figured it out!

Money makes your dreams come true.

DIANE (CONT'D)

(old spirit returning)

Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of

springing your mom some day...

KANSAS

Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

DIANE

And if the O.J. trial taught us

anything, it taught us that in America,

you can cut off someone's head and still

be found innocent if you have enough

money.  Your mom only shot a guy...

DIANE (CONT'D)

Now Cleo, I know you dream of an all

leather apartment with Conan - I heard

the school shrink telling a lunch lady.

DIANE (CONT'D)

And Hannah, you could give your share to

your church - or maybe buy one of those

hungry little kids Sally Struthers

advertises.

HANNAH

Or, I could get my own horse...

DIANE

Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to

provide a future for my baby.  I know my

bank branch like the back of my puffy

little hand.  I could open that safe in

my sleep!

KANSAS

I'm in.

KANSAS (CONT'D)

I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest

thing to a goddamn family that I've ever

had.  If one of us needs something, we

all do.

LUCY

Stop it!  This is crazy!

CLEO

I'm in, too.

LUCY

Cleo!

CLEO

Kansas is right.  We're like sisters --

we're closer than sisters.  And you

don't turn your back on family.

DIANE

C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies

all the time.

LUCY

And they get caught!

DIANE

That's right.  So all we have to do is

watch a bunch of movies and learn from

their mistakes.

CLEO

And you know real cops aren't half as

smart as Keanu.

LUCY

Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to

Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't

risk it.

CLEO

(sotto, to Kansas)

Conan went to Harvard.

KANSAS

(sotto)

Shut up.

DIANE

Lucy, do you know for sure you're going

to get that scholarship?

LUCY

No.

DIANE

If you don't - can you still afford to

go to Harvard?

LUCY

... I don't know.  Probably not.

DIANE

So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure

bet.

LUCY

Well...

LUCY (CONT'D)

I guess we're in this together.

LUCY (CONT'D)

But, we have to make a smart plan!

DIANE

Of course - of course!  Hands in...

DIANE (CONT'D)

We all have to cross-our-hearts-hope-to

die-stick-a-dirty-needle-in-my-eye that

HANNAH

I'm only allowed "G" movies.

At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"

Well how'd you like me to introduce my

I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna

DIANE (CONT'D)

It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever

Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted

to do this - for you... for ourselves.

HANNAH

Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie...

I'll just say I'm counting dirty words

for Sunday School.

DIANE

That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to

think we could learn to rob a bank from

watching movies.  Sex - you can learn

from movies.  But robberies?  There's no

way.

DIANE (CONT'D)

Besides, TV-LAND had a "Little House On

The Prairie" marathon and the Ingalls

made baby Carrie's bed in a dresser

Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!

Those babies are gonna get a good start

Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll

DIANE

Ammo?

HANK

Bullets.

DIANE

Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these

are just to scare people.

Kinda like round-off, back handspring,

Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred

Tonight in St. Louis, bottom of the

ninth...

DAN PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Ramirez with the pitch... McGwire

gone...

DAN PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

McGwire goes yard for the forty-second

time this season...

DAN PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...right into a waiting pack of pregnant

Bettys.

DAN PATRICK

Did I say that right?  A "pack" of

Bettys?  It might be a "gaggle" of

Bettys...

TV STATIC DISSOLVE TO:

KENNY

(mumbled, pointing O.C.)

What the hell?!

KYLE

What the hell are you s'posed to be?

CARTMAN

I'm a bank-robbin' Betty.

STAN

You're not a bank-robbin' Betty - you're

a fat fuck in drag...

CARTMAN

I am not a fat fuck in drag!!!

TV STATIC DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

Then it happened - the moment I'd been

waiting for!  Our dip-shits in blue

finally followed up on my evidence...

CONAN

...they now believe a group of young

women are responsible for the Betty Bank

Robbery.

(to Andy)

I've said for years the Betty Doll was a

bad influence on young girls.

ANDY

You sure have...can't shut you up about

your Bettys.

CONAN

(laughing)

That's right.  Now, I mean I'm no

authority on young girls.

(mugging to camera)

Or am I?

(to Andy, laughing)

That was kinda creepy.

ANDY

Do you have to notify police if you

move?

KANSAS

It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!

DIANE

Remember, Kansas, every time you point a

finger you've got three more pointing

back at you.

KANSAS

She's been the weak tit on this mama cat

since the beginning.

KANSAS (CONT'D)

That you?

DIANE

Yeah, hold on.

KANSAS

Just call me later.  I gotta get some

smokes for Grandma.

DIANE

Don't use big bills!

KANSAS

For a pack of cigs?  I use her food

stamps.

DIANE

Hello?

HANNAH

(freaking out)

We're dead!  They showed this prison

movie to my youth group on Sunday.

DIANE

Hannah, we've...

HANNAH

It wasn't like the prison we saw - all

these women had to shave their heads

because they got lice from the filthy

lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna

be someone's bald bitch!

DIANE

Ooops, hold on a sec.

LUCY

Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and

said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then

I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had

to go.  I think her Grandma had another

heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want

to "fuck me up?"

DIANE

She thinks you went to the police.

LUCY

WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go

to the police?

DIANE

I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see

you tomorrow.

HANNAH

...my Sunday School teacher says that in

prison, women shove broom sticks up

your...

DIANE

Hold on...

DIANE

Yeah?

DIM SUM CHARLIE

(screaming in Chinese)

Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm

being held against my will, my civil

rights have been violated and it took

four days to make this one phone call...

DIANE

Hello?

DIM SUM CHARLIE

Kim-Lo?

DIANE

No.  This is Diane.  I think you have

the wrong number.

DIANE (CONT'D)

Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!

DIM SUM CHARLIE

(about to kill himself)

Wrong number  Nooooooo!

DIANE

Hello?

CLEO

Di?  I just called to say that Conan

talked about us again last night.

DIANE

(first smile in a while)

Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.

CLEO

Bye.

HANNAH

...and a "bitch slap."  I bet that

really hurts!

DISSOLVE TO:

DIANE

(still perky)

Morning, sunshine.

Remember, except for the morning

sickness, blinding back pain and

embarrassingly unpredictable gas - these

are the best days of your life.

DIANE (CONT'D)

So far.

DIANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Hey, hey, hey, not so fast...

DIANE (CONT'D)

Following your dream is not a crime.

Nobody suspects you.  Nobody has a clue.

LISA

Hey guys.  Someone not take a shower

today?

KANSAS

Hey Lisa, did you run into Carmen

Electra last summer?

LISA

No.

KANSAS

Oh.  'Cause is looks like you got some

of her tits in you...

LISA

This just came from the National High

School Cheerleading Association.  You

might want to look it over before you

try any more "cradle dismounts from

double base partner stunts that are over

shoulder stand level without using three

catchers."  Oh, or before you think

about robbing another bank.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA

...and that's why I came forward.  I

mean, even the kids on the short bus can

see that all the evidence points to

Diane and the A-squad.

FBI AGENT

Sure does.  Your testimony will prove

invaluable.

LISA

Unfortunately, it wasn't them.

DISSOLVE TO:

LISA (V.O.)

They were all waiting in my Suburban

while I ran into the Safeway that day

for cash...

DISSOLVE THROUGH LIST TO:

LISA (V.O.)

We were on our way to practice.  Now, I

really need to get going, 'cause nobody

ever got ahead by sitting on their

behind...

DIP TO BLACK.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE TO BLACK.
