FADE IN:

1   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1

ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes

small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth

playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights.

On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a

tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise

in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods

of the   foothills.

2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2

Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and

parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out

a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.

3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3

Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor

collides with the debris of a recent party.

She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and

house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses.

Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding

glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool.

A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water

onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer.

He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the

vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.

4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4

The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE

LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.

OWNER

I've got the five stores here and

then two in Rio Rancho.

JOE

That's fantastic. See, if we're

talking that kind of volume I can

absolutely massage the numbers a

little. Seriously, you're not gonna

be able to keep it on the shelf.

Joe pulls out some order forms.

OWNER

Yeah, I'd need to look at some

things before I can place an order.

The owner looks at Joe's business card.

OWNER

How about I give you a call if I

decide to--

JOE

I'll call you. Not a problem. No

problem at all. Even better, I'll

swing by. You're on my route. How

`bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.

OWNER

Yeah, tomorrow's not good.

JOE

Thursday then. That's better

anyway. That'll give you a chance

to take a look see on those other

stores. We'll put everything on one

order and get you a good price

break.

The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.

JOE

My advice to you - weed out some of

this weaker product to make more

space for the corn. Like this...

Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.

JOE

Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright

idea was it to stock that? I mean

come on, what self respecting kid

asks his mom for apricot fruit

leather?

The owner is not amused.

5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5

Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters

to his rusted Monte Carlo.

6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6

Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH

LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with

MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the

exchange with amusement.

Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits

the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and

joins the fray.

MR. KIM

You are fired.

NORAH

I so don't care.

Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she

continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might

not have been the best decision ever.

NORAH

Fuck.

He's slowly freezing to death and

he knows lobsterman is out there...

somewhere... coming for him. And

he's totally screwed because his

tongue is stuck to the mailbox.

Why did he lick the mailbox?

I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and

NORAH

An then, he hears a horrible sound.

Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag.

Lobsterman is coming.

OSCAR

Maybe he didn't go to school

because he had the ACD.

OSCAR

Sorry.

NORAH

He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the

skin off his tongue and make a run

ROSE

Norah and a cop? That would happen.

We were working a scene today where

this guy offs himself in a sporting

You would not believe how much

money they charge for that shit.

It's ridiculous.

Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started

Breathe.

Norah snaps back.

NORAH

I need more beer.

Norah pulls herself off the couch and starts for the keg. She

stops. Turns.

NORAH

Um. Can I get you anything?

LYNN

I'm good.

Norah offers a nervous smile.

100   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                       100

Norah and Randy lie on a thread bare couch. Their bodies rock

to the motion of sex. Norah's thoughts are elsewhere.

A small TV sits next to Norah's growing collection of found

trinkets. It spills blue light into the smoke tinged air.

On the TV, a REPORTER stands outside Quicky Lube. Norah turns

her attention to the TV while Randy pumps and grinds. She

grabs the remote.

REPORTER

control driver crashed his car into

a south side Quicky Lube killing

one employee.

Shh.

Randy steps out onto the porch where the big bosomed RABBIT

LADY strokes her rabbit. He closes the door behind him.

RANDY

Hey.

RABBIT LADY

Hey.

Randy starts down the steps feeling dejected.

Randy stops and turns.

The large glass panel that made up the front of the store is

shattered. Shards dangle from red tipped edges. Blood and

glass mingle on the linoleum floor and plastic chairs.

Outside, Mac motions a stunned crowd to disperse. Rose and

Norah walk confidently past Mac into the lobby where a man

wearing a Quick Lube shirt stands off to the side and cries.

Nut job goes through the window

(he stops, turns)

You guys are BBP Certified, right?

ROSE

Legally, it's not really necessary.

NORAH

We are.

ROSE

We're in the process.

NORAH

You went to that thing.

ROSE

We adhere to all the proper

procedures when dealing with a

potentially hazardous situation. We

are very professional.

NORAH

Wait. I thought you went to that

thing.

Rose scans the area.

ROSE

Are you guys all finished?

OFFICER

It's all yours.

Rose and Norah slip into their Tyvecs.

Why don't you grab the wet-vac and

NORAH

What do you mean you went to part

of it? It was a one day thing.

ROSE

I got side tracked.

NORAH

Side tracked?

ROSE

That Above and Beyond guy was

there. Carl. We got talking shop

NORAH

Oh my God, you humped Carl!

Rose can't deny it. Norah shakes her head.

You figure you'll tip the delivery

delivery guy turns out to be a

Oscar thinks.

Joe assumes there's no way the kid's getting this and turns

his attention outside. A truck appear on the horizon.

OSCAR

Two dollars?

JOE

Hey, how'd you come up with that?

OSCAR

Math.

The truck slows down as it reaches the intersection, pulls

off the road, and stops. Joe gets out and walks over.

Oscar watches the trucker hop down from the cab and shake

Joe's hand like they're old friends.

CUT TO

The trunk of the Monte Carlo brims with shrimp and ice. Joe

slams it closed, climbs in the car and gives Oscar a wink.

Joe beams with excitement.

JOE

The thing is Oscar...and this is

important to learn early...life is

sales. Buying and selling. It's the

The woman glares at Rose.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN

Oh, you want to get paid.

ROSE

We can come back later if that's

better.

The woman shakes her head and holds out a check.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN

I can't believe I have to deal with

this now. My son just died for

Christ's sake.

The woman looks away.

ROSE

I'm so sorry for your loss.

Rose starts to leave.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN

Rose fills a cup at the soda fountain. Through the window she

sees Mac and family pull up on the other side of the store.

Mac gets out and pumps gas. The woman, HEATHER, laughs with

the little girl in the back seat. They look happy.

Rose's fountain drink overflows.

ROSE

Dammit.

Rose grabs for a napkin which clumps and tears.

The door BEEPS. Rose jumps behind the candy rack and peeks

around. All clear. She turns and smacks into Heather. Heather

glares at Rose.

HEATHER

You think I don't know?

Heather trembles with anger. Rose stands frozen.

HEATHER

You may have been hot shit in high

school but what are you now?

Nothing. A waste of space.

Heather reaches out and gives Rose a little push. Ten years

of anger culminating in this one anti climactic gesture.

Rose watches Heather walk away and knows every word is true.

112   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                           112

A stream of water leaks from the trunk. Joe gets out cursing

under his breath. He kicks the car and a hub cap falls off.

It's an unbearable insult.

JOE

Stupid shit heap!

Fifty years of failures result in an explosion of

frustration. Joe stomps on the hub cap, picks it up and

throws it as far as he can.

Joe gathers himself and leans in the window. He forces a

smile at Oscar. Oscar looks nervous.

It's alright. Everything's okay.

Joe opens the trunk and checks on the shrimp. A car zooms by.

Joe tries to wave it down. No good. Another zooms by.

JOE

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Joe struggles to wave down a car. No luck. Joe has an idea.

JOE

Make like you're crying.

Oscar turns on the tears. A car stops.

113   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING                         113

Rose walks in. Oscar and Joe feign casualness.

Joe looks at the bathroom door which stands open. Inside the

tub brims with shrimp and ice.

ROSE

What did you guys do today?

OSCAR

Nothing.

Rose turns to Joe who shrugs.

ROSE

How's it without Norah here?

Weird.

Joe walks over and casually shuts the bathroom door.

I'm really sorry. I swear it won't

Norah shakes her head. Randy doesn't know what to say.

NORAH

Listen, Randy I think we should

stop hanging out.

RANDY

You're breaking up with me over the

rabbit lady?

Norah doesn't respond.

RANDY

I don't know, the way you act, I

didn't even think that you'd care

that much.

NORAH

Yeah, I don't. I should, but I

don't. And you're a really great

guy. But...I don't care if you have

sex with the rabbit lady... and I

mean, it seems like I should care

about that.

Rose opens a stack of neglected mail. She is interrupted by a

light knock on the door. Rose peeks out the peep hole.

MAC

It was great seeing you last night.

You looked so professional and

Mac touches her lightly on the arm.

ROSE

How's the baby?

Mac looks away.

MAC

I just wanted to congratulate you

on the business. Seems like things

are really going great for you.

Rose and Mac's eyes meet.      Rose smiles.

ROSE

They are. If we keep going at this

rate I can hire a couple of

employees soon, put a little more

in marketing, give those Clean

Rose glows.

Norah leads Lynn through a wooded area toward a train

trestle. Norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack.

LYNN

Are the bodies there?

NORAH

No. The person is gone. It's weird

`cuz we're connected to them in

this strangely intimate way... but

we never actually meet them. It's

just kind of weird.

Norah steps over a discarded tire.

NORAH

Lynn nods.

Norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the

six pack and starts to climb.

NORAH

You're gonna miss the best part.

I accept that.

The two cans of beer dangle from Norah's arm like a giant

charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs.

NORAH

pissed off God up in your face just

screaming at you. So close you can

smell the metal on his breath.

LYNN

Sounds great.

NORAH

It is. I'm telling you.

Norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her

fingers against the rusted girder. After a moment she leans

A giggling Rose stumbles in. She stops. The bathroom door is

open slightly. She walks over peeks through the opening.

There's a dress crumpled on the floor. A woman slumps

motionless in the tub. Her delicate hand hangs over the edge.

Scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain.

Norah enters the front door. She smiles, unburdened by the

knowledge. She runs towards Rose. Rose quickly pushes her

back and closes the door.

Norah senses something's wrong. She struggles to see what's

behind the door but Rose won't let go.

grows distant and is replaced by Norah's laughter.

Still laughing, Norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on

a beam next to her. The beer falls. Norah tries to catch it,

loses her balance and falls with a thud.

Lynn catches her breath.

LYNN

Oh, shit.

Lynn runs over to find Norah on her back, eyes closed. Norah

Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips. Smiles. Looks at

Norah. Norah's a deer in headlights. Lynn kisses Norah's

hand. Everything is still and tense.

LYNN

Better?

Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks

up to   Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester

kiss.   Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on

Lynn.   All is good.

Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed

enjoying the moment.

Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly

across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures.

Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes.

Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.

LYNN

Is that?

Lynn pulls away.

LYNN

Are those...

Lynn tries to suss it out, shakes her head, looks at Norah.

LYNN

How do you have my school pictures?

NORAH

I just... I found them. I was gonna

tell you.

Lynn shakes her head disbelieving.

LYNN

Where would you find old pictures

of me?

NORAH

At work.

LYNN

What?

NORAH

We did this job a while back. This

woman...

Lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf.

Her eyes focus on the photo ID. Her mother. Her face goes

completely blank. Shock.

LYNN

My mom.

Norah bites her lip and nods.

LYNN

My mom is dead.

A hazy mix of shame, sadness and guilt seeps into the void.

NORAH

I wanted to tell you... that first

day. That's why I--

LYNN

You knew this whole time?

NORAH

I think... You know, I think

there's a reason that I found them.

The pictures. Because that lead me

to you, right?

NORAH (cont'd)

And I don't know exactly what went

on between you and your mom... what

the situation was... but it just

seems like... You know, of anybody,

I would understand.

Lynn's hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp.

Anger. She looks at Norah with disgust.

LYNN

You would understand?

Lynn turns to leave.

NORAH

Wait. Please. Don't...I--

Lynn opens the door. Norah reaches out but Lynn stops her

with an icy look.

LYNN

You're sick, you know that? There's

something wrong with you.

Lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap.

Norah sinks down onto the couch. Just Norah now. The

emptiness crowds around her.

Rose wears a slip and unusually big hair. She grabs several

Rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs

ROSE

Great. No problem.

NORAH

So tell him we can't do it.

ROSE

It's an insurance company. They

Rose and Oscar walk up to the house. Rose tries the door but

Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy

Rose recoils at the intense smell.

JOE

I'm busy here.

He tries to swing the door shut but Rose stops it. Steps in.

ROSE

Damn it dad, you scared me.

Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and

avoids looking at Rose.

JOE

Those snotty restaurant fucks

Bastards completely shut me out.

Rose leans against the door and watches her father. A wet

slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage.

ROSE

I need you to watch Oscar.

Another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage.

JOE

I can't.

ROSE

What do you mean you can't?

JOE

I can't watch Oscar today Rose.

ROSE

I'm in a real bind here.

Winston looks nervous. He looks at Oscar.

WINSTON

I guess not.

ROSE

You're a lifesaver.

WINSTON

You did your hair different.

ROSE

Winston nods.

ROSE

All right. Be good. I'll pick him

Rose leaves. Oscar and Winston are left on their own. Winston

Dab the end of that in the glue.

Just a little bit.

Oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue

OSCAR

WINSTON

It's a strut.

With delicate precision, Winston attaches the piece.

OSCAR

What's a strut?

WINSTON

Supports the wing.

Oscar examines one of the many completed models.

OSCAR

Rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. She's flanked by Paula

MOUSEY

So Rose, what are you doing? Are

you still cleaning houses?

PAULA

Rose has gone into real estate.

MOUSEY

Really?

ROSE

Actually, I own my own business.

MOUSEY

A real estate business?

ROSE

No. It's a biohazard removal and

crime scene clean up service. It's

a growth niche industry right now

highly technical and competitive.

MOUSEY

What does that mean  biohazard

removal whatever?

ROSE

A lot of times, when somebody dies,

it can be kind of, you know, messy.

So, we go in and clean up all that

left over mess. Make sure that the

area is clean and sanitary.

Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.

Pleased with herself, Rose grabs another cheese puff.

ROSE

Real growth industry.

MOUSEY

I can't imagine. You like doing it?

ROSE

Yeah.

Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.

ROSE

I do. We come into the lives of

people who have just experienced

something so sad and profound.

They've lost somebody. The

circumstances are different but

that's the same.

As Rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. Relaxes. That

brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.

ROSE

And we help them. In this one small

way... we help.

Rose is lost in her thoughts. Something profound is shifting.

Norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door.

It tips and Norah bangs her hand against the door frame.

NORAH

146   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               146

Norah drags the mattress to the driveway. A wisp of smoke

curls from the window behind her.

As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW

rise from the bushes. She investigates.

A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges

looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.

NORAH

Oh my God, you're the cutest thing

ever. Did you get left behind?

The kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for

a meow. Norah is powerless to resist.

NORAH

It's okay.

As Norah leans down to pick up the kitten, it darts from the

bushes and heads toward the road.

NORAH

No, no, no.

Norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and

disappears behind a house.

After a moment, Norah emerges from behind the house. She coos

at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An

expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her.

Norah runs toward the house.

phone. She checks caller ID. It's Norah. She cuts it off.

Sorry.

Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start

distributing the diapers.

house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror.

Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she

sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones

on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps

on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door

Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be.

NORAH

Well, if you had been here to help

matter. Prove to your old

Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose.

Winston smiles.

154   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                             154

Smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray.

Rose looks up to see Oscar in his PJs, one arm tucked in his

shirt, the sleeve dangling empty. Rose musters a smile.

ROSE

You brush your teeth?

Oscar nods, kisses her good night. Rose watches him walk to

his room and takes a drag from her cigarette.

There's a knock at the door.

155   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                         155

Rose looks through the peep hole and sees Mac fidgeting

outside. She takes a step from the door and freezes.

Mac knocks again.

156   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       156

Mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation. He shifts

his weight and jangles some change in his pocket.

157   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             157

Rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.

MAC (O.S.)

Rose?

She takes a breath, opens her eyes, then opens the door.

MAC

Hey beautiful.

Mac smiles for the both of them.

MAC

I was starting to think you were on

a date or something.

Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.

MAC

You okay?

Rose nods.

ROSE

Long day.

MAC

Can I come in?

ROSE

It's not really a good time.

Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.

MAC

I got you something.

Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to

Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.

MAC

It's for your business cards. You

put `em in there and, I don't

know... impress people.

He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.

ROSE

It's beautiful.

Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.

MAC

You don't like it?

ROSE

No, I like it very much.

Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.

ROSE

It's just this thing we're doing.

MAC

Come on, let's not do that.

But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.

ROSE

I don't want this anymore.

Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.

MAC

So that's it?

Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to

ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.

MAC

That's it then.

Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he

nods and Rose watches him walk away.

158   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES  ONE WEEK LATER - DAY            158

Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past

her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn.

Lynn sees Norah and looks away.

GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.)

Is this your first time donating?

Norah turns to the GUY IN THE WHITE COAT addressing her. He

holds a clipboard.

NORAH

No.

GUY IN WHITE COAT

Can I get your name?

NORAH

I need to talk to Lynn.

Lynn approaches.

LYNN

She can't donate. You can't donate.

She points to a sign indicating how often people can donate.

LYNN

Forty-eight days. It's not been

forty-eight days.

NORAH

Why are you acting like this? Why

haven't you called me back.

LYNN

Listen, I just, don't think you're

the kind of person I need to be

hanging out with right now.

NORAH

What's that supposed to mean?

LYNN

Do I really need to spell it out?

Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of

photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn.

NORAH

Here.

Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining

blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can.

A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an

`I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.

159   EXT. TINGLEY PARK- DAY                                            159

flotilla of ducks. Joe smiles as the greedy little bastards

squabble over his offering.

160   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                160

Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the

van. Other equipment litters pavement around the van.

Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard.

WINSTON

I'm sure I can turn this stuff

around pretty quick.

ROSE

Thanks. For everything.

OSCAR

Are you coming to my party?

Awkward moment. Rose looks from Oscar to Winston.

ROSE

We're going to Hinkle's Saturday

for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great

if you came.

WINSTON

Sounds like a blast.

Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice.

161   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                            161

Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel.

As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation

note and tosses it in the trash.

162   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY               162

Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like

restaurant. Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular

case. He beams with anticipation.

Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair

of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.

JOE

That other pair we looked at, full

of gadgets and gimmicks.

JOE (cont'd)

They just didn't have the heft you

want in a pair of lenses. No

weight. No history.

Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.

JOE

These here are the real deal. I

want you to have them.

Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't

see this coming. But still.

ROSE

Dad, you promised him those others.

From the store. He's been talking

about it for weeks.

Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.

JOE

No Rose, I want to him to have

these.

Winston eyes the binoculars.

WINSTON

Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

Joe nods.

WINSTON

Porro prism?

Joe nods full of pride.

JOE

Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks

on the objectives. Perfect bloom.

Winston looks at Oscar.

WINSTON

You got yourself some classic

binoculars there.

Norah walks in.

NORAH

Sorry I'm late.

Norah noogies Oscar and drops a gift in front of him.

Hey.

Norah kisses Joe on the cheek and ignores Rose. Rose gets up.

JOE

Where are you going?

Rose walks to the bathroom.

163   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - DAY                       163

Rose splashes water on her face. Norah walks in and leans

against the counter. Rose makes no sign of acknowledgement.

Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.

NORAH

Winston cleans up pretty good.

Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans

past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.

NORAH

I read somewhere that beauty is

really all about symmetry. Like

having eyes the same size and all

that.

(pause)

So, you know, when you factor that

in he's like, hot.

Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah

walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.

NORAH

Listen, I know I fucked up, okay?

Like really huge and I know that

and I'm sorry, okay?

It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just

the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.

ROSE

God, that drives me crazy! That

whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a

big fuck up' routine. Like that's a

legitimate excuse.

Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards

Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.

NORAH

I really am sorry. But it really

isn't all my fault, Rose.

ROSE

I think there's something wrong

with you. The way your brain works.

I mean, what the hell? It's like

you can't be trusted with anything.

You just screw around all the time

like it's all a big fucking game.

It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not

all just here for your amusement.

You should have been paying

attention. You should have been

focused on the job.

Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She

grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault.

NORAH

What are you going to do now?

ROSE

I got some ideas. I was thinking

maybe we could--

Norah shakes her head.

NORAH

I've got my own ideas.

Rose nods. As they exit, she turns to Norah.

ROSE

So, you really think he's hot?

NORAH

Winston? No.

164   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - DAY                                 164

Rose and Norah return from the bathroom. Joe eyeballs the

girls in silent appraisal of the situation. Seems okay.

NORAH

You gonna open my present?

Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos.

OSCAR

Cool.

NORAH

The guy said that if you're careful

they'll last a whole month. And

these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns

and shit. They're all based on

classic biker designs.

Oscar picks up one of the tattoos.

Cool.

ROSE

What's that say?

NORAH

Li'l bastard.

Rose looks at Norah.

ROSE

Cool.

Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt

and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's

ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve.

NORAH

I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

JOE

Where?

Shrug.

ROSE

How?

NORAH

Haven't worked it all out yet. I

was thinking I could maybe take the

van.

Rose shakes her head.

ROSE

I'm selling the van.

JOE

Don't sell the van.

ROSE

Have to. Can't afford the payment.

JOE

No, listen... just don't sell the

van.

Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza. She can't watch

Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm

he lifts the binoculars to his face.

JOE

Rose tells me you make models.

WINSTON

Yeah.

JOE

Any money in that?

WINSTON

Not really.

The wait staff begins to sing a birthday song.

Rose quietly kisses Oscar's forehead and pulls up the covers.

She turns and steals another look before shutting the door.

166   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                          166

Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills. She opens one,

sighs, sets it aside. She moves on to the next one.

The TV flickers blue light into the room. Rose stops and

looks at the TV.

The phone wakes Norah. She fumbles for the receiver.

NORAH

ROSE

Turn your TV on. Channel sixty-

Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS

Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with

each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine

Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag.

She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and

candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at

her. She looks up to see the CB on.

Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment

before taking the handset.

ROSE

Hello? Mom?

Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming.

ROSE

Oscar turned eight today. We had

this whole big thing at Hinkle's.

Winston came. After dinner Oscar

and Norah got a high score on

Centipede and put in ASS as their

initials and got in trouble by the

manager.

and sees Joe sitting on the steps to her house.

ROSE

Dad?

JOE

There's something I wanted to talk

to you about.

Rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car.

ROSE

Okay.

JOE

Well, I was wondering if I could

move in with you and Oscar.

ROSE

What?

JOE

Just temporarily - until I find a

place.

ROSE

You lost the house. Oh my god, you

It's not just some get rich quick

scheme. And I got a partner who has

Rose's edge softens slightly. She's listening now. Joe points

to where the newly painted Econo van is parked.

In bold cursive: LORKOWSKI CLEANING. Underneath in smaller

letters: SPECIALIZING IN BIOHAZARD REMOVAL SINCE 1963.

ROSE

Nineteen sixty-three?

JOE

Don't make a big deal out of it.

With windows down, Norah drives across an open landscape. She

Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. She

The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the

invisible strand over a pencil. She glances over to Oscar.

Oscar doesn't flinch.

With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls.

It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting.

Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal

the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.

Norah walks down a corridor. The kitten clings to her. She

Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground.

Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black

gorilla. KOKO. She turns her massive head and looks at Norah.

KOKO
