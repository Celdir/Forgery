"FORREST GUMP"

Screenplay by

Eric Roth

Based on a novel by

Winston Groom

FORREST

Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

FORREST

You want a chocolate?

FORREST

I could eat about a million and a

half of these. My momma always said,

"Life was like a box of chocolates.

You never know what you're gonna

get."

FORREST

Those must be comfortable shoes.

I'll bet you could walk all day in

shoes like that and not feel a thing.

I wish I had shoes like that.

BLACK WOMAN

My feet hurt.

FORREST

Momma always says there's an awful

lot you could tell about a person by

their shoes. Where they're going.

Where they've been.

FORREST

I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I

think about it real hard I could

remember my first pair of shoes.

FORREST

Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

FORREST (V.O.)

She said they was my magic shoes.

DOCTOR

All right, Forrest, you can open

your eyes now. Let's take a little

walk around.

DOCTOR

How do those feel? His legs are

strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've

ever seen. But his back is as crooked

as a politician.

DOCTOR

But we're gonna straighten him right

up now, won't we, Forrest?

MRS. GUMP

Forrest!

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, when I was a baby, Momma named

me after the great Civil War hero,

General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

FORREST (V.O.)

She said we was related to him in

some way. And, what he did was, he

started up this club called the Ku

Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in

their robes and their bedsheets and

act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks

or something. They'd even put

bedsheets on their horses and ride

around. And anyway, that's how I got

my name. Forrest Gump.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma said that the Forrest part was

to remind me that sometimes we all

do things that, well, just don't

make no sense.

MRS. GUMP

Just wait, let me get it.

MRS. GUMP

Let me get it. Wait, get it this

way. Hold on.

MRS. GUMP

All right.

MRS. GUMP

Oooh. All right. What are you all

staring at? Haven't you ever seen a

little boy with braces on his legs

before?

MRS. GUMP

Don't ever let anybody tell you

they're better than you, Forrest. If

God intended everybody to be the

same, he'd have given us all braces

on our legs.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma always had a way of explaining

things so I could understand them.

FORREST (V.O.)

We lived about a quarter mile of

Route 17, about a half mile from the

town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in

the county of Greenbow. Our house

had been in Momma's family since her

grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come

across the ocean about a thousand

years ago. Something like that.

FORREST (V.O.)

Since it was just me and Momma and

we had all these empty rooms, Momma

decided to let those rooms out. Mostly

to people passing through. Like from,

oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like

that. That's how me and Mommy got

money. Mommy was a real smart lady.

MRS. GUMP

Remember what I told you, Forrest.

You're no different than anybody

else is.

MRS. GUMP

Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

You're the same as everybody else.

You are no different.

PRINCIPAL

Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.

Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.

MRS. GUMP

Well, we're all different, Mr.

Hancock.

FORREST (V.O.)

She wanted me to have the finest

education, so she took me to the

Greenbow County Central School. I

met the principal and all.

PRINCIPAL

I want to show you something, Mrs.

Gump. Now, this is normal.

PRINCIPAL

Forrest is right here. The state

requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to

attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

He's gonna have to go to a special

school. Now, he'll be just fine.

MRS. GUMP

What does normal mean, anyway? He

might be a bit on the slow side, but

my boy Forrest is going to get the

same opportunities as everyone else.

He's not going to some special school

to learn to how to re-tread tires.

We're talking about five little points

here. There must be something can be

done.

PRINCIPAL

We're a progressive school system.

We don't want to see anybody left

behind.

PRINCIPAL

Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

MRS. GUMP

He's on vacation.

PRINCIPAL

Well, your momma sure does care about

your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.

PRINCIPAL

You don't say much, do you?

MRS. GUMP

Finally, he had to try it. It looked

easy, but, oh, what happened. First

there...

FORREST

Momma, what's vacation mean?

MRS. GUMP

Vacation?

FORREST

Where Daddy went?

MRS. GUMP

Vacation's when you go somewhere,

and you don't ever come back.

FORREST (V.O.)

Anyway, I guess you could say me and

Momma was on our own.

FORREST (V.O.)

But we didn't mind. Our house was

never empty. There was always folks

comin' and goin'.

MRS. GUMP (V.O.)

Suppa.

MRS. GUMP

It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...

MAN WITH CANE

My, my. That sure looks special.

MRS. GUMP

Gentlemen, would you care to join us

for supper? Hurry up and get it before

the flies do. I prefer you don't

smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometimes we had so many people

stayin' with us that every room was

filled with travelers. You know,

folks livin' out of their suitcases,

and hat cases, and sample cases.

MRS. GUMP

Well, you go ahead and start. I can't

find Forrest.

MRS. GUMP

Forrest... Forrest...

FORREST (V.O.)

One time a young man was staying

with us, and he had him a guitar

case.

ELVIS PRESLEY

(sings)

"Well, you ain't never caught a

rabbit, and you ain't no friend of

mine."

MRS. GUMP

Forrest! I told you not to bother

this nice young man.

ELVIS

Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I

was just showin' him a thing or two

on the guitar here.

MRS. GUMP

All right, but your supper's ready

if y'all want to eat.

ELVIS

Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you,

ma'am.

ELVIS

Say, man, show me that crazy little

walk you just did there. Slow it

down some.

ELVIS

(sings)

"You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound

dog..."

FORREST (V.O.)

I liked that guitar.

FORREST (V.O.)

It sounded good.

ELVIS

(sings)

"...cryin' all the time"

ELVIS

(sings)

"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."

FORREST (V.O.)

I started moving around to the music,

swinging my hips. This one night me

and Momma...

FORREST (V.O.)

...was out shoppin', and we walked

right by Benson's Furniture and

Appliance store, and guess what.

ELVIS

(sings)

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

ELVIS

(sings)

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

MRS. GUMP

This is not children's eyes.

ELVIS

(sings)

"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit

and you ain't no friend of mine."

FORREST (V.O.)

Some years later, that handsome young

man who they called "The King," well,

he sung too many songs, had himself

a heart attack or something.

FORREST

Must be hard being a king. You know,

it's funny how you remember some

things, but some things you can't.

MRS. GUMP

You do your very best now, Forrest.

FORREST

I sure will, Momma.

FORREST (V.O.)

I remember the bus ride on the first

day of school very well.

BUS DRIVER

Are you comin' along?

FORREST

Momma said not to be taking rides

from strangers.

BUS DRIVER

This is the bus to school.

FORREST

I'm Forrest Gump.

BUS DRIVER

I'm Dorothy Harris.

FORREST

Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

BOY #1

This seat's taken.

BOY #2

It's taken!

BOY #3

You can't sit here.

FORREST (V.O.)

You know, it's funny what a young

man recollects. 'Cause I don't

remember being born.

FORREST (V.O.)

I, I... don't recall what I got for

my first Christmas and I don't know

when I went on my first outdoor

picnic. But, I do remember the first

time I heard the sweetiest voice...

FORREST (V.O.)

...in the wide world.

GIRL

You can sit here if you want.

FORREST (V.O.)

I had never seen anything so beautiful

in my life. She was like an angel.

JENNY

Well, are you gonna sit down, or

aren't ya?

JENNY

What's wrong with your legs?

FORREST

Um, nothing at all, thank you. My

legs are just fine and dandy.

FORREST (V.O.)

I just sat next to her on that bus

and had conversation all the way to

school.

JENNY

Then why do you have those shoes on?

FORREST

My momma said my back's crooked like

a question mark. These are going to

make me as straight as an arrow.

They're my magic shoes.

FORREST (V.O.)

And next to Momma, no one ever talked

to me or asked me questions.

JENNY

Are you stupid or something.

FORREST

Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.

JENNY

I'm Jenny.

FORREST

I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.

FORREST (V.O.)

From that day on, we was always

together. Jenny and me was like peas

and carrots.

FORREST (V.O.)

She taught me how to climb...

JENNY

Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

FORREST (V.O.)

...I showed her how to dangle.

FORREST

"...a good little monkey and..."

FORREST (V.O.)

She helped me to learn how to read.

FORREST (V.O.)

And I showed her to swing.

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait

for the stars.

FORREST

Momma's gonna worry about me.

JENNY

Just stay a little longer.

FORREST (V.O.)

For some reason, Jenny didn't never

want to go home.

FORREST

Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.

FORREST (V.O.)

She was my most special friend.

FORREST

My only friend.

FORREST

Now, my Momma always told me that

miracles happen every day. Some people

don't think so, but they do.

BOY #1

Hey... dummy!

BOY #2

Are you retarded, or just plain

stupid?

BOY #3

Look, I'm Forrest Gump.

JENNY

Just run away, Forrest.

JENNY

Run, Forrest!

JENNY

Run away! Hurry!

BOY #2

Get the bikes!

BOY #3

Hurry up!

BOY #3

Let's get him! Come on!

BOY #2

Look out, dummy, here we come!

BOY #2

We're gonna get you!

JENNY

Run, Forrest! Run!

JENNY

Run, Forrest!

BOY #1

Come back here, you!

JENNY

Run, Forrest! Run!

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, you wouldn't believe it if I

told you.

FORREST

But I can run like the wind blows.

FORREST

From that day on, if I was going

somewhere, I was running!

BOY #2

He's gettin' away! Stop him!

OLD CRONY

That boy sure is a running fool.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now remember how I told you that

Jenny never seemed to want to go

home? Well, she lived in a house

that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma

had gone up to heaven when she was

five and her daddy was some kind of

a farmer.

FORREST

Jenny? Jenny?

FORREST (V.O.)

He was a very lovin' man. He was

always kissing and touchin' her and

her sisters. And then this one time,

Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to

school.

FORREST

Jenny, why didn't you come to school

today?

JENNY

Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

JENNY'S DAD

Jenny!

JENNY

Come on!

JENNY'S DAD

Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd

better come back here, girl!

JENNY'S DAD

Where you at?

JENNY'S DAD

Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!

JENNY

Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

JENNY'S DAD

Jenny!

JENNY

Dear God, make me a bird so I can

fly far, far, far away from here.

Dear God, make me a bird so I can

fly far, far, far away from here.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma always said that God is

mysterious.

JENNY'S DAD

Jenny! Get back here!

FORREST (V.O.)

He didn't turn Jenny into a bird

that day. Instead...

FORREST (V.O.)

...he had the police say Jenny didn't

have to stay in that house no more.

She went to live with her grandma

just over on Creekmore Avenue, which

made me happy 'cause she was so close.

FORREST (V.O.)

Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and

come over to my house, just 'cause

she said she was scared. Scared of

what, I don't know...

FORREST (V.O.)

...but I think it was her grandma's

dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny

and me was best friends...

FORREST (V.O.)

...all the way to high school.

OLDER BOY #1

Hey, stupid!

JENNY

Quit it!

JENNY

Run, Forrest, run!

OLDER BOY #1

Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?

JENNY

Run, Forrest!

OLDER BOY #2

Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

JENNY

Run, Forrest! Run!

OLDER BOY #1

You better be runnin', stupid.

OLDER BOY #2

Come on, dummy!

OLDER BOY #1

Haul ass, dummy!

OLDER BOY #1

Yeah, you better be runnin'!

BOY

Ya-hoo!

OLDER BOY #1

Move it, jack rabbit!

OLDER BOY #1

Come on!

BOY

Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on,

Forrest! Yeah!

JENNY

Run, Forrest!

FORREST

Now, it used to be, I ran to get

where I was goin'. I never thought

it would take me anywhere.

OLDER BOY

Come on. Whoo-hoo!

FOOTBALL COACH

Who in the hell is that?

HIGH SCHOOL COACH

That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.

Just a local idiot.

FORREST (V.O.)

And can you believe it? I got to go

to college, too.

FOOTBALL COACH

Okay! Run!

FOOTBALL COACH

Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!

FOOTBALL COACH

You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!

Run!

FOOTBALL COACH

Run! Turn! Go!

FOOTBALL COACH

He must be the stupidest son-of-a-

bitch alive. But he sure is fast!

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, maybe it was just me but college

was very confusing times.

CHET HUNTLEY

(on TV)

Federal troops enforcing a court

order integrated the University of

Alabama today.

CHET HUNTLEY

Governor George Wallace had carried

out his symbolic threat to stand in

the schoolhouse door.

GOVERNOR WALLACE

We hereby denounce and forbid this

illegal and unwarranted action by

the central government.

KATZENBACH

(on TV)

Governor Wallace, I take it from

that, uh...

KATZENBACH

...statement that you are going to

stand in that door, and that you are

not going to carry out the orders of

this court, and that you are going

to resist us from doing so. I would

ask you once again to responsibility

step aside and if you do not, I'm

going to assure you...

FORREST

Earl, what's going on?

EARL

Coons are tryin' to get into school.

FORREST

Coons? When raccoons try to get on

our back porch, Momma just chase 'em

off with a broom.

EARL

Not raccoons, you idiot, niggas. And

they want to go to school with us.

FORREST

With us? They do?

NEWSMAN

(on TV)

...block the doorway, President

Kennedy ordered the Secretary of

Defense then to use the military

force.

NEWSMAN

Here by videotape is the encounter

by General Graham, Commander of the

National Guard, and Governor Wallace.

GOVERNOR WALLACE

We must have no violence today, or

any other day, because these National

Guardsmen are here today as Federal

Soldiers for Alabamans. And they

live within our borders and they are

all our brothers. We are winning in

this fight because we are awakening

the American people to the dangers

that we have spoken about so many

times, just so evident today, the

trend toward military dictatorship

in this country.

NEWSMAN

And so at day's end the University

of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been

desegregated and students Jimmy Hood

and Vivian Malone had been signed up

for summer classes.

FORREST

Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.

CHET HUNTLEY

(on TV)

Governor Wallace did what he promised

to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa

campus, he kept the mob from gathering

and prevented violence.

ASSISTANT COACH

Say, wasn't that Gump?

CHET HUNTLEY

(on TV)

NBC News will present a special

program on the Alabama integration

story at 7:30 p.m. tonight...

ASSISTANT COACH

Naw, that couldn't be.

FOOTBALL COACH

It sure as hell was.

CHET HUNTLEY

...standard Eastern Daylight Time.

Now a word from Anacin.

FORREST (V.O.)

A few years later, that angry little

man at the schoolhouse door thought

it would be a good idea, and ran for

President.

FORREST (V.O.)

But, somebody thought that it wasn't.

FORREST

But he didn't die.

BLACK WOMAN

My bus is here.

FORREST

Is it the number 9?

BLACK WOMAN

No, it's the number 4.

FORREST

It was nice talkin' to you.

WHITE WOMAN

I remember when that happened, when

Wallace got shot. I was in college.

FORREST

Did you go to a girls' college, or

to a girls' and boys' together

college?

WHITE WOMAN

It was co-ed.

FORREST

'Cause Jenny went to a college I

couldn't go to. It was a college

just for girls.

FORREST (V.O.)

But, I'd go and visit her every chance

I got.

JENNY

Ouch! That hurts.

JENNY

Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!

Stop it!

BILLY

Jesus!

JENNY

What are you doing?

FORREST

He was hurtin' you.

BILLY

What the hell is going on here?

JENNY

No, he's not!

BILLY

Who is that? Who is that?

JENNY

Get over there!

JENNY

Billy, I'm sorry.

BILLY

What in the hell, git, would you git

away from me!

JENNY

Don't... Wait a second!

BILLY

Git, just git away from me!

JENNY

Don't go! Billy, wait a second!

JENNY

He doesn't know any better!

JENNY

Forrest, why'd you do that?

FORREST

I brought you some chocolates. I'm

sorry. I'll go back to my college

now.

JENNY

Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come

on.

FORREST

Is this your room?

JENNY

Shh!

JENNY

Do you ever dream, Forrest, about

who you're gonna be?

FORREST

Who I'm gonna be?

JENNY

Yeah.

FORREST

Aren't I going to be me?

JENNY

Well, you'll always be you, just

another kind of you. You know? I

want to be famous.

JENNY

I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

I just want to be an empty stage

with my guitar, my voice... just me.

JENNY

And I want to reach people on a

personal level. I want to be able to

say things, just one-to-one.

JENNY

Have you ever been with a girl,

Forrest?

FORREST

I sit next to them in my home

economics class all the time.

DJ

(over radio)

You're listening to WHHY in

Birmingham, the clear A.M. voice of

Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...

DJ

(over radio)

...coming to you on a night that is

anything but clear. The weatherman

says that rain's gonna fall all night

long so stay with us, get warm, get

cozy, get under the covers to the

cool sounds of WHHY.

FORREST

Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

JENNY

It's okay.

playing the music you want to hear

when you want to hear it. If you

DJ

(over radio)

Candy is on the line tonight. Candy's

answering the phones, give Candy

your request, your dedication, and

ask her why she won't go out with

me, would you? Here's more music.

JENNY

It's okay.

FORREST

Oh, I'm dizzy.

JENNY

I bet that never happened in home

ec.

FORREST

No.

FORREST

I think I ruined your roommate's

bathrobe.

JENNY

I don't care. I don't like her,

anyway.

CROWD

Run! Run! Run!

CROWD

Run! Run! Run!

CROWD

Stop!

FORREST (V.O.)

College ran by real fast 'cause I

played so much football.

FORREST (V.O.)

They even put me on a thing called

the All-America Team where you get

to meet the President of the United

States.

ANNOUNCER

(over newsreel)

President Kennedy met with the

Collegiate All-American Football

Team at the Oval Office today.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, the real good thing about meeting

the President of the United States

is the food.

FORREST (V.O.)

They put you in this little room

with just about anything you'd want

to eat or drink. And since number

one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...

FORREST (V.O.)

...and number two, they was free, I

musta drank me about fifteen Dr.

Peppers.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Congratulations. How does it feel to

be an All-American?

1ST PLAYER

It's an honor, Sir.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Congratulations. How does it feel to

be an All-American?

2ND PLAYER

Very good, Sir.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Congratulations. How does it feel to

be an All-American?

3RD PLAYER

Very good, Sir.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Congratulations. How do you feel?

FORREST

I gotta pee.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

I believe he said he had to go pee.

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometime later, for no particular

reason, somebody shot that nice young

President when he was ridin' in his

car.

FORREST

And a few years after that...

FORREST (V.O.)

...somebody shot his little brother,

too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.

FORREST

It must be hard being brothers. I

wouldn't know.

DEAN

Forrest Gump.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now can you believe it? After only

five years of playing football, I

got a college degree.

DEAN

Congratulations, son.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma was proud.

MRS. GUMP

Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here,

I'll hold this for you.

MILITARY RECRUITER

Congratulations, son. Have you given

any thought to your future?

FORREST

Thought?

FORREST (V.O.)

Hello, I'm Forrest...

FORREST

...Forrest Gump.

ARMY BUS DRIVER

Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you

are, fuzzball! You're not even a

lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get

your faggoty ass on the bus. You're

in the Army now!

RECRUIT #1

This seat's taken.

RECRUIT #2

It's taken.

FORREST (V.O.)

At first, it seemed like I made a

mistake.

FORREST (V.O.)

...seeing how it was my induction

day and I was already gettin' yelled

at.

BUBBA

You can sit down... if you want to.

FORREST (V.O.)

I didn't know who I might meet or

what they might ask.

BUBBA

You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

FORREST

No, but I been on a real big boat.

BUBBA

I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin'

boat. I've been workin' on shrimp

boats all my life. I started out my

uncle's boat, that's my mother's

brother, when I was about maybe nine.

I was just lookin' into buyin' a

boat of my own and got drafted. My

given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

BUBBA

People call me Bubba. Just like one

of them redneck boys. Can you believe

that?

FORREST

My name's Forrest Gump. People call

me Forrest Gump.

FORREST (V.O.)

So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,

Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.

FORREST (V.O.)

And her momma before her cooked

shrimp.

FORREST (V.O.)

And her momma before her momma cooked

shrimp, too. Bubba's family knew

everything...

FORREST (V.O.)

...there was to know about the

shrimpin' business.

BUBBA

I know everything there is to know

about the shrimpin' business. Matter

of fact, I'm goin' into the shrimpin'

business for myself after I get out

the Army.

FORREST

Okay.

DRILL SERGEANT

Gump! What's your sole purpose in

this Army?

FORREST

To do whatever you tell me, Drill

Sergeant!

DRILL SERGEANT

Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned

genius! That's the most outstanding

answer I've ever heard. You must

have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred

and sixty! You are godamned gifted,

Private Gump!

DRILL SERGEANT

Listen up, people...

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, for some reason, I fit in the

Army like one of them round pegs.

It's not really hard. You just make

your bed real neat and remember to

stand up straight.

DRILL SERGEANT

That is one very intelligent

individual! You lock your scuzzy

bodies up behind that private and do

exactly what he does and you will go

far in this man's army!

FORREST (V.O.)

And always answer every question

with "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

DRILL SERGEANT

Is that clear?

FORREST & RECRUITS

Yes, Drill Sergeant!

BUBBA

What you do is you just drag your

nets across the bottom. On a good

day, you can catch over a hundred

pounds of shrimp. If everything goes

all right, two men shrimpin' ten

hours, less what you spends on gas,

you can...

FORREST

Done, Drill Sergeant!

DRILL SERGEANT

Gump!

DRILL SERGEANT

Why did you put that weapon together

so quickly, Gump?

FORREST

You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

DRILL SERGEANT

Jesus Christ! This is a new company

record. If it wouldn't be a waste of

such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd

recommended you for O.C.S., Private

Gump. You are gonna be a General

some day, Gump! Now, disassemble

your weapon and continue!

BUBBA

Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is

the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue

it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute

it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp

creole...

BUBBA

...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried,

stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp,

lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper

shrimp...

BUBBA

...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp

salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp

burger, shrimp sandwich... that's,

that's about it.

FORREST (V.O.)

Nighttime in the Army is a lovely

time.

FORREST (V.O.)

We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd

miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.

YOUNG PRIVATE

Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on

her!

FORREST (V.O.)

Turns out, Jenny had gotten into

some trouble over... some photos of

her in her college sweater. And she

was thrown out of school.

SONG

"My baby does the hanky-panky..."

FORREST (V.O.)

But that wasn't a bad thing. Because

a man who owns a theater in Memphis,

Tennessee, saw those photo and offered

Jenny a job singing in a show. The

first chance I got, I took the bus

up to Memphis to see her perform in

that show.

EMCEE

That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give

her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.

And now, for your listening and

viewing pleasure, direct from

Hollywood, California, our very own

beatnik beauty, let's give a big

round of applause to the luscious

Bobbie Dylan.

CROWD

Bobbie... Bobbie...

JENNY

(sings)

"Yes, and how many seas must the

white dove said, before she sleeps

in the sand."

FORREST (V.O.)

Her dream had come true. She was a

folk singer.

JENNY

(sings)

"Yes, how many times must the

cannonballs fly before they're forever

banned."

MAN #1

You gotta lose the guitar, darling.

MAN #2

Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up.

Shake it up now.

MAN #3

Hey, somebody ought to get her a

harmonica.

JENNY

(sings)

"The answer, my friend is blowing in

the wind. The answer is blowing in...

MAN #

...skin, honey. This isn't Captain

Kangaroo.

MEN

Yeah! Come on!

MAN #5 :

Hey, honey, I got something here for

you.

MAN #5

Goddamnit!

JENNY

Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a

song here. Polly, get out here!

MAN #

Hey, show us some stuff, honey!

JENNY

Shut up! Oh, shut up!

JENNY

Forrest, what are you doing here?

What are you doing?

FORREST

Come on.

JENNY

What are you doing? Forrest, let me

down!

JENNY

You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

You can't keep tryin' to rescue me

all the time.

FORREST

They was tryin' to grab you.

JENNY

A lot of people try to grab me. Just --

you can't keep doing this all the

time!

FORREST

I can't help it. I love you.

JENNY

Forrest, you don't know what love

is.

JENNY

You remember that time we prayed,

Forrest? We prayed for God to turn

me into a bird so I could fly far,

far away?

FORREST

Yes, I do.

JENNY

You think I can fly off this bridge?

FORREST

What do you mean, Jenny?

JENNY

Nothing.

JENNY

I gotta get outta here.

FORREST

But wait. Jenny!

JENNY

Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?

You just stay away from me, please.

JENNY

Can I have a ride?

DRIVER

Where you going?

JENNY

I don't care.

DRIVER

Get in the truck.

FORREST

So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me

to Vietnam. It's this whole other

country.

JENNY

Just hang on a minute.

JENNY

Listen, you promise me something,

okay? Just if you're ever in trouble,

don't try to be brave, you just run,

okay? Just run away.

FORREST

Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the

time.

FORREST (V.O.)

And just like that.

FORREST (V.O.)

...she was gone.

MRS. GUMP

You come back safe to me, do ya hear?

SONG

"Some folks are born made to wave

the flag. Ooh, they're red, white

and blue. And when the band plays

"Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point

the cannon at you all. It ain't me.

It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's

son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, they told us that Vietnam was

gonna be very different from the

United Sates of America.

FORREST (V.O.)

Except for all the beer cans and the

barbecue, it was.

BUBBA

Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in

these waters. They tell me these

Vietnams is good shrimp. You know,

after we win this war, and we take

over everything we can get American

shrimpers to come on here and shrimp

these waters. We'll just shrimp all

the time, man. So much shrimp, why,

you wouldn't believe it.

LT. DAN

You must be my F.N.G.'s.

BUBBA AND FORREST

Morning', sir!

LT. DAN

Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute

me. There are goddamned snipers all

around this area who would love to

grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant

Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

LT. DAN

What's wrong with your lips?

BUBBA

I was born with big gums, sir.

LT. DAN

Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.

Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

Where you boys from in the world?

BUBBA & FORREST

Alabama, sir!

LT. DAN

You twins?

FORREST

No, we are not relations, sir.

LT. DAN

Look, it's pretty basic here.

LT. DAN

You stick with me, you learn from

the guys who been in country awhile,

you'll be right. There is one item

of G.I. gear that can be the

difference between a live grunt and

a dead grunt.

LT. DAN

Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green.

Try and keep your feet dry when we're

out humpin'. I want you boys to

remember to change your socks wherever

we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's

feet right off his legs.

LT. DAN

Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is

that sling-rope I told you to order.

SGT. SIMS

I put in requisitions at Battalion.

LT. DAN

Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those

sonabitches again, call them again

and again and again. I don't care

how much it takes...

FORREST (V.O.)

Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt

real lucky he was my lieutenant. He

was from a long, great military

tradition. Somebody in his family

had fought and died in every single

American war.

LT. DAN

Goddamnit, kick some ass!

SGT. SIMS

I'm on it, Lieutenant.

LT. DAN

Get on it!

FORREST (V.O.)

I guess you could say he had a lot

to live up to.

LT. DAN

So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?

Well, I've been through there. Little

Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake

down your gear, see the platoon

sergeant, draw what you need for the

field.

LT. DAN

If you boys are hungry, we got steaks

burnin' right here.

LT. DAN

Two standing orders in this platoon.

One, take good care of your feet.

Two, try not to do anything stupid,

like gettin' yourself killed.

FORREST

I sure hope I don't let him down.

FORREST (V.O.)

I got to see a lot of countryside.

We would take these real long walks.

SONG

And we were always lookin' for this

guy named Charlie. I can't get no

relief.

LT. DAN

Hold it up!

SGT. SIMS

Hold up, boys!

FORREST (V.O.)

It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always

gettin' these funny feelings about a

rock or a trail, or the road, so

he'd tell you to get down, shut up!

LT. DAN

Get down! Shut up!

FORREST (V.O.)

So we did.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, I don't know much about anything,

but I think some of American's best

young men served in this war. There

was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland,

he was from Detroit.

CLEVELAND

Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the

hell's going on?

FORREST (V.O.)

And Tex was, well, I don't remember

where Tex come from.

LT. DAN

Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your

feet! Still got ten clicks to go to

that river.

LT. DAN

All right, move out! Comin' out.

Look alive out there.

FORREST (V.O.)

The good thing about Vietnam is there

was always someplace to go.

LT. DAN (V.O.)

Fire in the hole!

FORREST (V.O.)

And there was always something to

do.

LT. DAN

Mount 'em up.

SGT. SIMS

Spread out! Cover his back.

FORREST (V.O.)

One day it started raining, and it

didn't quit for four months.

FORREST (V.O.)

We been through every kind of rain

there is. Little bitty stingin'

rain...

FORREST (V.O.)

...and big ol' fat rain.

FORREST (V.O.)

Rain that flew in sideways.

FORREST (V.O.)

And sometimes rain even seemed to

come straight up from underneath.

FORREST (V.O.)

Shoot, it even rained at night.

BUBBA

Hey Forrest...

FORREST

Hey Bubba...

BUBBA

I'm gonna lean up against you, you

just lean right back against me.

BUBBA

This way, we don't have to sleep

with our heads in the mud. You know

why we a good partnership, Forrest?

'Cause we be watchin' out for one

another. Like brothers and stuff.

Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've

been thinkin' about. I got a very

important question to ask you. How

would you like to go into the

shrimpin' business with me?

FORREST

Okay.

BUBBA

Man, I tell you what, I got it all

figured out, too. So many pounds of

shrimp to pay off the boat, so many

pounds for gas, we can just live

right on the boat. We ain't got to

pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we

can just work it together. Split

everything right down the middle.

Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty.

And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp

you can get.

FORREST

That's a fine idea.

FORREST (V.O.)

Bubba did have a fine idea.

FORREST (V.O.)

I even wrote Jenny and told her all

about it. I sent her letters. Not

every day, but almost. I told her

what I was doin' and asked her what

she was doing, and I told her how I

thought about her always.

FORREST (V.O.)

And how I was looking forward to

getting a letter from her just as

soon as she had the time I'd always

let her know that I was okay.

FORREST (V.O.)

Then I'd sign each letter, "Love,

Forrest Gump."

SONG

"There's something happenin' here.

What it is ain't exactly clear.

There's a man with a gun over there,

telling' me I got to beware."

FORREST (V.O.)

This one day, we was out walking,

like always, and then, just like

that, somebody turned off the rain

and the sun come out.

LT. DAN

Take cover!

LT. DAN

Get that pig up here, goddammit!

BUBBA

Forrest, you okay?

LT. DAN

...Strongarm, please be advised...

BUBBA

Medic, we got a man down!

LT. DAN

Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

LT. DAN

Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have

incoming from the treeline at point

blue plus two. A.K's and rockets...

SOLDIER WITH BIG MACHINE GUN

Misfire! Misfire!

LT. DAN

Goddammit, Mac! Get that pig unfucked

and get it in the treeline!

LT. DAN

(into radio)

Ah, Jesus! My unit is down hard and

hurting! 6 pulling back to the blue

line, Leg Lima 6 out! Pull back!

Pull back!

BUBBA

Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest!

LT. DAN

Pull back!

BUBBA

Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest! Run!

Run!

SGT. SIMS

Pull back! Let's go!

LT. DAN

Run, goddammit, run!

SOLDIER

Medic! Medic! Jesus, can I get a

medic?

FORREST (V.O.)

I ran and ran, just like Jenny told

me to.

FORREST (V.O.)

I ran so far and so fast that pretty

soon I was all by myself, which was

a bad thing.

FORREST

Bubba!

FORREST (V.O.)

Bubba was my best good friend. I had

to make sure he was okay.

1ST SOLDIER

Any friendlies out there?

2ND SOLDIER

Yeah, I've got three over there.

1ST SOLDIER

Where the hell are you?

FORREST

Bubba?

FORREST (V.O.)

And on my way back to find Bubba,

well, there was this boy laying on

the ground.

FORREST

Tex!

FORREST

Okay.

FORREST (V.O.)

I couldn't just let him lay there

all alone, scared the way he was, so

I grabbed him up and run him out of

there.

FORREST (V.O.)

And every time I went back looking

for Bubba, somebody else was saying,

"Help me, Forrest. Help me."

DALLAS

Can't hear... Can't hear...

2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER

No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're

gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

FORREST (V.O.)

I started to get scared that I might

never find Bubba.

STRONGARM

(over radio)

You're danger close for crack air,

over.

LT. DAN

(into radio)

Roger, Strongarm, I know my position

is danger close! We got Charlie all

over this area! I gotta have those

fast movers in here now! Over!

STRONGARM

(over radio)

Six, Strongarm, we want...

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

LT. DAN

I know he's dead! My whole goddamned

platoon is wiped out!

STRONGARM

(over radio)

Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you

this transmission? Over.

LT. DAN

Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave

me here! Get away. Just leave me

here! Get out!

STRONGARM

Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is

Strongarm, be advised, your fast

movers are inbound at this time,

over.

FORREST (V.O.)

Then it felt like something just

jumped up and bit me.

FORREST

Ah, something bit me!

LT. DAN

You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't

leave the platoon! I told you to

leave me there, Gump. Forget about

me. Get yourself out! Did you hear

what I said! Goddammit, pull me down!

Get your ass out of here!

LT. DAN

I didn't ask you to pull me out of

there, goddamn you! What the hell do

you think you're going?

FORREST

To get Bubba.

LT. DAN

I got an air strike inbound right

now. They're gonna nape the whole

area.

LT. DAN

Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's

an order!

FORREST

I gotta find Bubba!

BUBBA

Forrest...

FORREST

Bubba...

BUBBA

I'm okay.

FORREST

Oh, Bubba, no...

BUBBA

Naw, I'm gonna be all right.

FORREST

Come on. Come on. Come here...

BUBBA

I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.

LT. DAN

Helo's inbound. Pop smoke, get it up

there!

FORREST (V.O.)

If I'd a known this was gonna be the

last time me and Bubba was gonna

talk, I'd a thought of something

better to say.

FORREST

Hey, Bubba...

BUBBA

Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this

happen?

FORREST

You got shot.

FORREST (V.O.)

Then Bubba said something I won't

even forget.

BUBBA

I wanna go home.

FORREST (V.O.)

Bubba was my best good friend. And

even I know that ain't something you

can find just around the corner.

Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat

captain, but instead he died right

there by that river in Vietnam.

FORREST

That's all I have to say about that.

MAN

It was a bullet, wasn't it?

FORREST

A bullet?

MAN

That jumped up and bit you.

FORREST

Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the

buttocks. They said it was a million

dollar wound, but the Army must keep

that money, 'cause I still ain't

seen a nickel of that million dollars.

The only good thing about being

wounded in the buttocks...

FORREST (V.O.)

...is the ice cream. They gave me

all the ice cream I could eat. And

guess what. A good friend of mine

was in the bed right next door.

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice

cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

MALE NURSE

It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

MALE NURSE

Harper...

SOLDIER

Cooper, Larson, Webster, Gump, Gump...

FORREST

I'm Forrest Gump.

SOLDIER

Gump, how can you watch that stupid

shit? Turn it off!

ANNOUNCER

From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you

are tuned to the American Forces

Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6,

Saigon.

SOLDIER

Good catch, Gump. You know how to

play this?

SOLDIER

Come on, let me show you. Here.

SOLDIER

Now the secret to this game is, no

matter what happens, never, never

take your eye off the ball.

SOLDIER

All right...

FORREST (V.O.)

For some reason, ping pong came very

natural to me.

SOLDIER

See, any idiot can play.

FORREST (V.O.)

So I started playing it all the time.

FORREST (V.O.)

I played ping-pong even when I didn't

have anyone to play ping-pong with.

FORREST (V.O.)

The hospital's people said it made

me look like a duck in water, whatever

that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would

come and watch me play.

FORREST (V.O.)

I played ping-pong so much, I even

played it in my sleep.

LT. DAN

Now, you listen to me. We all have a

destiny. Nothing just happens, it's

all part of a plan. I should have

died out there with my men! But now,

I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple!

A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at

me! Do you see that? Do you know

what it's like not to be able to use

your legs?

FORREST

Well... Yes, sir, I do.

LT. DAN

Did you hear what I said? You cheated

me. I had a destiny. I was supposed

to die in the field! With honor!

That was my destiny! And you cheated

me out of it! You understand what

I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed

to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny.

I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.

FORREST

Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Look at me. What am I gonna do now?

What am I gonna do now?

OFFICER

P.F.C. Gump?

FORREST

Yes, sir!

OFFICER

As you were.

OFFICER

Son, you've been awarded the Medal

of Honor.

FORREST

Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they

want to give me a me...

FORREST

Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant

Dan?

NURSE

They sent him home.

FORREST (V.O.)

Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

ANCHORMAN

(on T.V.)

The ceremony was kicked off with a

candid speech by the President

regarding the need for further

escalation of the war in Vietnam.

President Johnson awarded four Medals

of Honor to men from each of the

Armed Services.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON

America owes you a debt of gratitude,

son.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON

I understand you were wounded. Where

were you hit?

FORREST

In the buttocks, sir.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON

Oh, that must be a sight.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON

I'd kinda like to see that.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON

Goddamn, son.

FORREST (V.O.)

After that, Momma went to the hotel

to lay down, so I went out for a

walk to see our national capital.

ISABEL

Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,

what do you want me to do with them?

HILARY

What are you doing here so late?

HILARY

We've been waiting for you for half

an hour, so just get them in a line,

will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures

later. You look great. Oh come on,

get in this line, come on, come on

right in line. Come on, let him here,

let him in here.

FORREST (V.O.)

It's a good thing Momma was resting,

'cause the street was awful crowded

with people looking at all the statues

and monuments. And some of them people

were loud and pushy.

HILARY

Okay, follow me! Come on.

HILARY

Let's move it out.

VET

Hey, buddy, come on. We could use

your help.

FORREST (V.O.)

Everywhere I went, I had to stand in

line.

HILARY

Follow me, let's go!

ISABEL

All right, come on, guys.

HILARY

Stand here.

VET

Hey, you're a good man for doin'

this. Good!

FORREST

Okay.

ABBIE HOFFMAN

We must declare to that fucking

impostor in the White House --

Johnson. We ain't going to work on

your farm no more! Yeah!

FORREST (V.O.)

There was this man, giving a little

talk. And for some reason, he was

wearing an American flag for a

shirt...

ABBIE HOFFMAN

Now, I'm going to bring up some

soldiers that are going to talk about

the war, man...

FORREST (V.O.)

...and he liked to say the "F" word.

A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And

every time...

ABBIE HOFFMAN

...that war has come home, and we

have to stop these politicians...

FORREST (V.O.)

...he said "F" word, people, for

some reason, well, they'd cheer.

ABBIE HOFFMAN

...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson

where to stick this fucking war!

Yeah!

ABBIE HOFFMAN

Come on, man. Come up here, man.

HILARY

Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!

HILARY

Come on, get up there. Come on. Move,

move. Let's go! Let's go.

VET

Come on, go. You can do it. Just get

up there. Go on. That's it.

ABBIE HOFFMAN

Tell us a little bit about the war,

man.

FORREST

The war in Vietnam?

ABBIE HOFFMAN

The war in Viet-fucking-nam!

FORREST

Well...

FORREST (V.O.)

There was only one thing I could say

about the war in Vietnam.

FORREST

...there was only one thing I could

say about the war in Vietnam.

FORREST

In Vietnam war...

POLICEMAN

Hey, what the hell are you doing?

HILARY

I'll beat your head in, you goddamned

oinker!

ISABEL

Christ, what'd they do with this?

CROWD

We can't hear you! We can't hear

anything!

HILARY

This one! This one! Give me that!

HILARY

That's it.

FORREST

...and that's all I have to say about

that.

ABBIE HOFFMAN

That's so right on, man. You said it

all. What's your name, man?

FORREST

My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest

Gump.

ABBIE HOFFMAN

Forrest Gump!

CROWD

Forrest Gump!

JENNY

(screaming)

Forrest! Forrest!

FORREST

Jenny!

JENNY

Forrest!

JENNY

Hey! Hey!

FORREST (V.O.)

It was the happiest moment of my

life.

FORREST (V.O.)

Jenny and me were just peas and

carrots again. She showed me around,

and even introduced me...

FORREST (V.O.)

...to some of her new friends.

RUBEN

Shut that blind, man. And get your

white ass away from that window.

Don't you know we in war here?

JENNY

Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's

one of us. He's one of us.

MASAI

Let me tell you about us.

WESLEY

Where the hell have you been?

JENNY

I ran into a friend.

MASAI

Our purpose here is to protect our

black leaders from the racial

onslaught of the pig who wishes to

brutalize our black leaders, rape

our women, and destroy our black

communists.

BLACK PANTHER

Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.

WESLEY

Who's the baby killer?

JENNY

This is my good friend I told you

about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest,

this is Wesley. Wesley and I live

together in Berkeley, and he's the

president of the Berkeley chapter of

S.D.S.

MASAI

Let me tell you something else.

WESLEY

I want to talk to you.

JENNY

Okay, but...

WESLEY

No. Now! Goddammit!

MASAI

We are here to offer protection and

help for all of those who need our

help, because we, the Black Panthers,

are against the war in Vietnam. Yes,

we are against any war where black

soldiers are sent to the front line

to die for a country that hates them.

Yes, we are against any war where

black soldiers go to fight and come

to be brutalized and killed in their

own communities as they sleep in

their beds at night. Yes, we are

against all these racists and imperial

dog acts.

JENNY

You are a fucking asshole!

JENNY

Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!

Stop it!

JENNY

Stop it!

WESLEY

Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought

you here. I should have known it was

just gonna be some bullshit hassle.

FORREST

He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

JENNY

Come on, Forrest.

FORREST

Sorry I had a fight in the middle of

your Black Panther party.

JENNY

He doesn't mean it when he does things

like this. He doesn't.

FORREST

I would never hurt you, Jenny.

JENNY

I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

FORREST

I wanted to be your boyfriend.

JENNY

That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You

look handsome in it. You do.

FORREST

You know what?

JENNY

What?

FORREST

I'm glad we were here together in

our national capitol.

JENNY

Me too, Forrest. I have so much to

tell you, you won't believe what's

been going on...

FORREST (V.O.)

We walked around all night, Jenny

and me, just talkin'.

FORREST (V.O.)

She told me about all the travellin'

she's done.

FORREST (V.O.)

And how she'd discovered ways to

expand her mind and learn how to

live in harmony...

FORREST (V.O.)

...which must be out west somewhere,

'cause she made it all the way to

California.

JENNY

(sings)

"Smile on your brother, everybody

get together, try to love on another

right now"

YOUNG HIPPIE

Hey, anybody want to go to San

Francisco?

JENNY

I'll go.

YOUNG HIPPIE

Far out!

FORREST (V.O.)

I was a very special night for the

two of us. I didn't want it to end.

FORREST

I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

JENNY

I have to, Forrest.

WESLEY

Jenny? Things got a little out of

hand. It's just this war and that,

that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I

would never hurt you. You know that.

FORREST

You know what I think? I think you

should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!

JENNY

Forrest, we have very different lives,

you know.

FORREST

I want you to have this.

JENNY

Forrest, I can't keep this.

FORREST

I got it just by doing what you told

me to do.

JENNY

Why're you so good to me?

FORREST

You're my girl.

JENNY

I'll always be your girl.

FORREST (V.O.)

And just like that, she was gone out

of my life again.

NEIL ARMSTRONG

That's one small step for man, one

giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the

surface is fine and powdery. I can,

I can pick it up loosely.

FORREST (V.O.)

I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

but instead, they decided the best

way for me to fight communists was

to play ping-pong. So I was in the

Special Services, traveling around

the country cheering up all them

wounded veterans and showing them

how to play...

FORREST

...ping-pong. I was so good that

some years later...

FORREST (V.O.)

...the Army decided I should be on

the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We

were the first Americans to visit

the land of China in like a million

years or something like that, and

somebody said that world peace was

in our hands. But all I did was play

ping-pong. When I got home...

FORREST

...I was national celebrity. Famouser

even than Captain Kangaroo.

DICK CAVETT

Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

DICK CAVETT

Mr. Gump, have a seat.

DICK CAVETT

Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

JOHN LENNON

Welcome home.

DICK CAVETT

You had quite a trip. Can you, uh,

tell us, uh, what was China like?

FORREST

Well, in the land of China, people

hardly got nothing at all.

JOHN LENNON

No possessions?

FORREST

And in China, they never go to church.

JOHN LENNON

No religion, too?

DICK CAVETT

Oh. Hard to imagine.

JOHN LENNON

Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

FORREST (V.O.)

Some years later, that nice young

man from England was on his way home

to see his little boy and was signing

some autographs. For no particular

reason at all, somebody shot him.

LT. DAN

They gave you the Congressional Medal

of Honor.

FORREST

Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant

Dan!

LT. DAN

They gave you the Congressional Medal

of Honor!

FORREST

Yes sir, they sure did.

LT. DAN

They gave you an imbecile, a moron

who goes on television and makes a

fool out himself in front of the

whole damn country, the Congressional

Medal of Honor.

FORREST

Yes, sir.

LT. DAN

Well, then, that's just perfect!

Yeah, well I just got one thing to

say to that. Goddamn bless America.

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan!

FORREST (V.O.)

Lieutenant Dan said he was living in

a hotel. And because he didn't have

no legs, he spent most of his time

exercising his arms.

LT. DAN

Take a right, take a right.

TAXI DRIVER #1

Hey! Come on already!

LT. DAN

Ah!

FORREST

What are you doing here in New York,

Lieutenant Dan?

LT. DAN

I'm living off the government tit.

Sucking it dry.

LT. DAN

Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I'm

walking here! Ah, get out...

TAXI DRIVER #2

Why don't you go home before you

kill yourself? Get out of the way!

LT. DAN

Come on, go! Go! Go!

FORREST (V.O.)

I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and

celebrated the holidays.

BOB HOPE

You have a great year and hurry home.

God bless you.

LT. DAN

Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

FORREST

I didn't know I was supposed to be

looking for him, sir.

LT. DAN

That's all these cripples, down at

the V.A., that's all they ever talk

about.

LT. DAN

Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I

found Jesus? They even had a priest

come and talk to me. He said God is

listening, but I have to help myself.

Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

I'll get to walk beside him in the

Kingdom of Heaven.

LT. DAN

Did you hear what I said? Walk beside

him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well,

kiss my crippled ass. God is

listening. What a crock of shit.

FORREST

I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why

don't you get your ass down to the

corner and get us another bottle of

wine.

FORREST

Yes, sir.

DICK CLARK

We are at approximately 45th Street

in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

This is the site of the old Astor

Hotel. Down below us, well over a

hundred thousand people are milling

about, cheering with horns and

whistles and hats...

LT. DAN

What the hell's in Bayou La Batre?

FORREST

Shrimpin' boats.

LT. DAN

Shrimpin' boats? Who gives a shit

about shrimpin' boats?

FORREST

I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin'

boats as soon as I have some money.

I made me a promise to Bubba in

Vietnam, that as soon as the war was

over, we'd go in partners. He'd be

the captain of the shrimpin' boat

and I'd be his first mate. But now

that he's dead, that means that I

gotta be the captain.

LT. DAN

A shrimp boat captain.

FORREST

Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,

Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Now hear this! Private Gump here is

gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well,

I tell you what, Gilligan, the day

that you are a shrimp boat captain,

I will come and be your first mate.

FORREST

Okay.

LT. DAN

If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,

that's the day I'm an astronaut.

LENORE

Danny, what are you complaining about?

CARLA

What are you doing, huh?

LENORE

Mr. Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?

FORREST

My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

LT. DAN

This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs

Lenore.

CARLA

So where you been, baby-cakes, huh?

Haven't seen you around lately. You

know, you should have been here for

Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round

on the house and gave everybody a

turkey sandwich.

LT. DAN

Well, well, I had, uh, company.

LENORE

Hey, hey! We was, we was just there.

That's at Times Square.

LENORE

Don't you just love New Year's? You

get to start all over.

CARLA

Hey, Lenore.

LENORE

Everybody gets a second chance.

FORREST (V.O.)

It's funny, but in the middle of all

that fun, I began to think about

Jenny.

DICK CLARK

(on television)

...getting wild out there. It's

beginning to...

DICK CLARK

(over television)

...pour here in Times Square. It's

been off-and-on all night, but these

people hang in there.

FORREST (V.O.)

Wondering how she was spending her

New Year's night out in California.

CROWD

(over television)

CROWD

(over television)

...1! Happy New Year!

PATRONS

(sing)

"Should auld acquaintance be forgot

and never brought to mind...

FORREST

Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

PATRONS

(sing)

Should auld acquaintance be forgot

and days of auld lang syne."

LENORE

What are you, stupid or something?

What's your problem? What's his

problem? Did you lose your pecker in

the war or something?

CARLA

What, is your friend stupid or

something?

LT. DAN

What did you say?

CARLA

I said, is your friend stupid or

something?

LT. DAN

Hey! Don't call him stupid!

CARLA

Don't push me like that!

LENORE

Hey, don't you push her!

LT. DAN

You shut up! Don't you ever call him

stupid!

CARLA

What's the matter, baby? Why you

treating me like shit?

LT. DAN

Get the hell out of here!

LENORE

You stupid gimp. You belong in

"Ripley's Believe It Or Not."

LT. DAN

Get the hell out of here! Go on!

LENORE

You should be in a side show!

LT. DAN

Go on! Get out of here! Get out of

here!

LENORE

You big loser!

CARLA

Come on, Lenore. We don't need this

shit!

LENORE

You're so pathetic.

LT. DAN

Get out of here!

CARLA

You retard!

LENORE

You loser! You freak!

LT. DAN

No!

FORREST

I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's

Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes

like cigarettes.

FORREST (V.O.)

I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's

some things you just can't change.

He didn't want to be called crippled,

just like I didn't want to be called

stupid.

LT. DAN

Happy New Year.

ANCHORMAN

The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with

President Nixon today at an Oval

Office ceremony...

FORREST (V.O.)

And wouldn't you know it...

FORREST

...a few months later they invited

me and the ping-pong team to visit

the White House. So I went again.

And I met the President of the United

States again.

FORREST (V.O.)

Only this time they didn't get us

rooms in a real fancy hotel.

PRESIDENT NIXON

So are you enjoying yourself in our

national capital, young man?

FORREST

Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT NIXON

Well, where are you staying?

FORREST

It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

PRESIDENT NIXON

Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much

nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very

modern. I'll have my people take

care of it for you.

SECURITY GUARD

Security, Frank Wills.

FORREST

Yeah, sir, you might want to send a

maintenance man over to that office

across the way. The lights are off,

and they must be looking for the

fuse box or something, 'cause them

flashlights they're, they're keeping

me awake.

SECURITY GUARD

Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

FORREST

Thank you.

SECURITY GUARD

No problem.

FORREST

Good night.

SECURITY GUARD

Good night.

PRESIDENT NIXON

(over television)

Therefore, I shall resign the

Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

PRESIDENT NIXON

(over television)

Vice President Ford will be sworn in

as President at that hour in this

office. As I recall the high hopes

for America with which we began this

second term, I feel a great sadness

that I will not be here in this

office...

OFFICER

Sergeant Gump!

FORREST

Yes, sir!

OFFICER

As you were. I have your discharge

papers. Your service is up, son.

FORREST

Does this mean I can't play ping

pong no more?

OFFICER

For the Army it does.

FORREST (V.O.)

And just like that, my service in

the United States Army was over. So

I went home.

FORREST

I'm home, Momma.

MRS. GUMP

I know, I know.

MRS. GUMP

Louise, he's here. He's here,

everybody.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, when I got home, I had no idea

that Momma had had all sorts of

visitors.

MRS. GUMP

We've had all sorts of visitors,

Forrest. Everybody wants you to use

their ping-pong stuff. One man even

left a check for twenty-five thousand

dollars if you'd be agreeable to

saying you like using their paddle.

FORREST

Oh, Momma. I only like using my own

paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.

LOUISE

Hey, Forrest.

MRS. GUMP

I know that. I know that. But it's

twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.

I thought maybe you could hold it

for a while, see if it grows on you.

Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look

real good.

FORREST (V.O.)

That Momma, she sure was right. It's

funny how things work out.

FORREST (V.O.)

I didn't stay home for long, because

I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I

always try to keep my promise. So I

went on down to Bayou La Batre to

meet Bubba's family and make their

introduction.

MRS. BLUE

Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

FORREST

Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

MRS. BLUE

I guess.

FORREST (V.O.)

And of course, I paid my respect to

Bubba himself.

FORREST

Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I

remember everything you said, and I

got it all figured out.

FORREST

I'm taking the twenty-four thousand,

five hundred and six-two dollars and

forty-seven cents that I got...

FORREST (V.O.)

...well, that's left after a new

hair cut and a new suit and I took

Momma out to real fancy dinner and I

bought a bus ticket and three Doctor

Peppers.

OLD SHRIMPER

Tell me something. Are you stupid or

something?

FORREST

Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

FORREST

Well, that's what's left after me

saying, "When I was in China on the

All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just

loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-

O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody

knows it isn't true, but Momma says

it's just a little white lie so it

wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway,

I'm putting all that on gas, ropes

and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin'

boat.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, Bubba had told me everything he

knows about shrimpin', but you know

what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.

FORREST

I only caught five.

OLD SHRIMPER

A couple of more, you can have

yourself a cocktail.

OLD SHRIMPER

Hey, you ever think about namin'

this old boat?

FORREST (V.O.)

I'd never named a boat before, but

there was only one I could think of.

FORREST (V.O.)

The most beautiful name in the wide

world.

GIRL

Okay.

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a

long while. But...

FORREST (V.O.)

But I thought about her a lot. And I

hoped that whatever she was doing

made her happy.

FORREST (V.O.)

I thought about Jenny all the time.

FORREST

Hi!

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing

here?

LT. DAN

Well, I thought I'd try out my sea

legs.

FORREST

Well, you ain't got no legs,

Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I

had to see this for myself. And I

told you if you were ever a shrimp

boat captain, that I'd be your first

mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of

my word.

FORREST

Okay.

LT. DAN

Yeah, but don't you be thinking that

I'm gonna be calling you sir.

FORREST

No, sir.

FORREST

That's my boat.

LT. DAN

I have a feeling if we head the east,

we'll find some shrimp. So, take a

left. Take a left.

FORREST

Which way?

LT. DAN

Over there! They're over there! Get,

get on the wheel and take a left!

FORREST

Okay.

LT. DAN

Gump, what are you doing? Take a

left! Left! That's where we're gonna

find those shrimp, my boy! That's

where we'll find 'em.

FORREST

Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Okay, so I was wrong.

FORREST

Well, how we gonna find them?

LT. DAN

Well, maybe you should just pray for

shrimp.

FORREST (V.O.)

So I went to church every Sunday...

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.

Though I think he left the praying

up to me.

FORREST

No shrimp.

LT. DAN

Where the hell's this God of yours?

FORREST (V.O.)

It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,

'cause right then, God showed up.

LT. DAN

You'll never sink this boat!

FORREST (V.O.)

Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant

Dan, he was mad.

LT. DAN

Come on! You call this a storm?

LT. DAN

Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's

time for a showdown! You and me. I'm

right here. Come and get me! You'll

never sink this boat!

ANCHORMAN

(over television)

Hurricane Carmen came through here

yesterday...

ANCHORMAN

...destroying nearly everything in

its path. And as in other towns up

and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's

entire shrimping industry...

ANCHORMAN

...has fallen victim to Carmen and

has been left in utter ruin. Speaking

with local officials, this reporter

has learned, in fact, only one

shrimping boat actually survived the

storm.

MRS. GUMP

Louise. Louise, there's Forrest!

FORREST (V.O.)

After that, shrimpin' was easy.

FORREST (V.O.)

And since people still needed them

shrimps for shrimp cocktails and

barbecues and all...

FORREST

...and we were the only boat left

standing "Bubba-Gump" shrimp's what

they got. We got a whole bunch of

boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol'

warehouse, we even have hats that

says "Bubba-Gump" on 'em. "Bubba-

Gump Shrimp." It's a household name.

MAN

Hold on there, boy. Are you telling

me you're the owner of the Bubba-

Gump Shrimp Corporation?

FORREST

Yes, sir. We've got more money than

Davy Crocket.

MAN

Boy, I've heard some whoppers in my

time, but that tops them all. We was

sitting next to a millionaire!

ELDERLY WOMAN

Well, I thought it was a very lovely

story. And you tell it so well. With

such enthusiasm.

FORREST

Would you like to see what Lieutenant

Dan looks like?

ELDERLY WOMAN

Well, yes, I would!

FORREST

That's him right there.

FORREST

And let me tell you something about

Lieutenant Dan.

LT. DAN

Forrest, I never thanked you for

saving my life.

FORREST (V.O.)

He never actually said so, but I

think he made his peace with God.

ANCHORMAN

(over television)

For the second time in seventeen

days, President Ford escaped possible

assassination today when a woman,

Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he

stepped out of a hotel in San

Francisco.

MARGO

(over radio)

Base to Jenny One. Base to Jenny

One.

LT. DAN

Jenny One, go Margo.

MARGO

(over radio)

Forrest has a phone call.

LT. DAN

Yeah, well you'll have to tell them

to call him back. He is indisposed

at the moment.

MARGO

(over radio)

His momma's sick.

ANCHORMAN

(over television)

Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of

Charles Manson better known as

"Squeaky," attempted to assassinate

the President as he was...

FORREST

Where's Momma?

LOUISE

She's upstairs.

MRS. GUMP

Hi, Forrest.

DOCTOR

I'll see you tomorrow.

MRS. GUMP

Oh, all right.

DOCTOR

We sure got you straightened out,

didn't we, boy?

FORREST

What's the matter, Momma?

MRS. GUMP

I'm dyin', Forrest. Come on in, sit

down over here.

FORREST

Why are you dyin', Momma?

MRS. GUMP

It's my time. It's just my time. Oh,

now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

Death is just a part of life. It's

something we're all destined to do.

I didn't know it, but I was destined

to be your momma. I did the best I

could.

FORREST

You did good, Momma.

MRS. GUMP

Well, I happened to believe you make

your own destiny. You have to do the

best with what God gave you.

FORREST

What's my destiny, Momma?

MRS. GUMP

You're gonna have to figure that out

for yourself. Life is a box of

chocolates, Forrest. You never know

what you're gonna get.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma always had a way of explaining

things so I could understand them.

MRS. GUMP

I will miss you, Forrest.

FORREST (V.O.)

She had got the cancer and died on a

Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with

little flowers on it.

FORREST

And that's all I have to say about

that.

FORREST

Didn't you say you were waiting for

the Number Seven bus?

ELDERLY WOMAN

There'll be another one along shortly.

FORREST

Now, because I had been a football

star, and a war hero, and a national

celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat

captain, and a college graduate, the

city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

decided to get together and offered

me a fine job.

FORREST (V.O.)

So, I never went back to work for

Lieutenant Dan.

FORREST (V.O.)

Though he did take care of my Bubba-

Gump money. He got me invested in

some kind of fruit company. And so

then I got a call from him saying we

don't have to worry about money no

more.

FORREST

And I said, "That's good. One less

thing."

FORREST (V.O.)

Now, Momma said there's only so much

fortune a man really needs...

REVEREND

Praise the Lord.

FORREST (V.O.)

...and the rest is just for showing

off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it

to the Four Square Gospel Church.

FORREST (V.O.)

And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou

La Batre Fishing Hospital.

FORREST (V.O.)

And even though Bubba was dead, and

Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I

gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.

FORREST

And you know what...

FORREST (V.O.)

She didn't have to work in nobody's

kitchen no more.

MRS. BLUE

Smells wonderful!

FORREST (V.O.)

And 'cause I was godzillionaire and

I liked doing it so much. I cut that

grass for free.

FORREST (V.O.)

But at nighttime, when there was

nothing to do and the house was all

empty, I'd always think of Jenny.

FORREST (V.O.)

And then, she was there.

JENNY

Hello, Forrest.

FORREST

Hello, Jenny.

FORREST (V.O.)

Jenny came back and stayed with me.

FORREST (V.O.)

Maybe it was because she had nowhere

else to go. Or maybe it was because

she was so tired, because she went

to bed and slept and slept like she

hadn't slept in years. It was

wonderful having her home.

FORREST (V.O.)

Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd

jabber on like a monkey in a tree.

And she'd listen about ping-pong and

shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a

trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'.

Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

FORREST

...big ol' gobs of rain and little

bitty stinging rain and rain...

JENNY

How could you do this?

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometimes I guess there just aren't

enough rocks.

FORREST (V.O.)

I never really knew why she came

back, but I didn't care. It was like

olden times. We was like peas and

carrots again.

FORREST (V.O.)

Every day I'd pick pretty flowers

and put them in her room for her.

FORREST (V.O.)

And she gave me the best gift anyone

could ever get in the wide world.

JENNY

Okay, you can open your eyes.

FORREST

New shoes.

JENNY

They make them just for running.

FORREST (V.O.)

And she even showed me how to dance.

And, well, we was like family...

Jenny and me.

FORREST (V.O.)

And it was the happiest time of my

life.

ANNOUNCER

(over television)

And this Fourth is witnessing one of

the largest fireworks displays in

the nation's two-hundred year

history...

JENNY

You done watching it?

FORREST

Mm-hmm.

ANNOUNCER

(over television)

...here in New York Harbor. After

the spectacular display of tall ships

earlier, the Statue of Liberty...

JENNY

I'm going to bed.

FORREST

Will you marry me? I'd make a good

husband, Jenny.

JENNY

You would, Forrest.

FORREST

But you won't marry me.

JENNY

You don't want to marry me.

FORREST

Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm

not a smart man, but I know what

love is.

FORREST

Jenny?

JENNY

Forrest, I do love you.

CAB DRIVER

Where are you running off to?

JENNY

I'm not running.

FORREST (V.O.)

That day, for no particular reason,

I decided to go for a little run.

FORREST (V.O.)

So I ran to the end of the road, and

when I got there, I thought maybe

I'd run to the end of town.

NEWSCASTER

President Carter, suffering from

heat exhaustion fell into the arms

of security agents.

FORREST (V.O.)

And when I got there...

FORREST (V.O.)

...I thought maybe I'd just run across

Greenbow County. And I figured since

I run this far, maybe I'd just run

across the great...

FORREST (V.O.)

...state of Alabama. And that's what

I did I ran clear across Alabama.

FORREST

For no particular reason, I just

kept on going. I ran clear to the

ocean.

FORREST (V.O.)

And when I got there, I figured since

I'd gone this far, I might as well

turn around, just keep on going.

FORREST (V.O.)

When I got to another ocean, I figured

since I've gone this far, I might as

well just turn back, keep right on

going.

FORREST (V.O.)

When I got tired, I slept. When I

got hungry, I ate.

FORREST

When I had to go, you know, I went.

ELDERLY WOMAN

And so, you just ran?

FORREST

Yeah.

FORREST (V.O.)

I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba,

and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all,

I thought about Jenny. I thought

about her a lot.

NEWSCASTER

For more than two years now, a man

named Forrest Gump, a gardener from

Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to

sleep, has been running across

America.

NEWSCASTER

Charles Cooper brings us this report.

NEWSMAN

For the fourth time on his journey

across America, Forrest Gump, a

gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is

about to cross the Mississippi River

again today.

JENNY

I'll be damned. Forrest...

NEWSMAN

Sir, why are you running?

1ST REPORTER

Why are you running?

2ND REPORTER

Are you doing this for world peace?

3RD REPORTER

Are you doing this for women's right?

NEWSMAN

Or for the environment?

REPORTER

Or for animals?

3RD REPORTER

Or for nuclear arms?

FORREST (V.O.)

They just couldn't believe that

somebody would do all that running

for no particular reason.

2ND REPORTER

Why are you doing this?

FORREST

I just felt like running.

FORREST

I just left like running.

YOUNG MAN

It's you. I can't believe it's really

you.

FORREST

Now, for some reason what I was doing

seemed to make sense to people.

YOUNG MAN

I mean, it was like an alarm went

off in my head, you know. I said,

here's a guy that's got his act

together. Here's somebody who's got

it, all figured out. Here's somebody

who has the answer. I'll follow you

anywhere, Mr. Gump.

FORREST (V.O.)

So, I got company.

FORREST (V.O.)

And after that I got more company.

And then...

FORREST (V.O.)

...even more people joined in.

Somebody later told me...

FORREST

...it gave people hope. Now... Now,

I don't know anything about that,

but...

FORREST (V.O.)

Some of those people asked me if I

could help them out.

AGING HIPPIE

Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering

if you might help me, huh? Listen,

I'm in the bumper sticker business

and I've been trying to think up a

good slogan. And since you have been

such a big inspiration to the people

around here, I thought you might be

able to help me jump into... Whoa!

Man, you just ran through a big pile

of dogshit!

FORREST

It happens.

AGING HIPPIE

What, shit?

FORREST

Sometimes.

FORREST (V.O.)

And some years later I heard that

fella did come up with a bumper

sticker slogan...

FORREST (V.O.)

...and he make a lot of money off of

it.

FORREST (V.O.)

Another time I was running along,

somebody who had lost all his money

in the T-shirt business, and he wanted

to put my face on a T-shirt, but he

couldn't draw that well and he didn't

have a camera.

WILD-EYED MAN

I think it would be really fortunate

for me if I could get your name on

these, oh, your face and name on

these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.

WILD-EYED MAN

Here, use this one. Nobody likes

that color anyway.

FORREST

Have a nice day.

FORREST (V.O.)

And some years later I found out

that that man did come up with a

idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot

of money off of it.

FORREST (V.O.)

Anyway, like I was saying, I had a

lot of company. My Momma always said

you got to put the past behind you

before you can move on. And I think

that's what my running was all about.

I had run for three years, two months,

fourteen days, and sixteen hours.

YOUNG MAN

Quiet. Quiet, he's gonna say

something.

FORREST

I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go

home now.

YOUNG MAN

Now what are we supposed to do?

FORREST (V.O.)

And just like that, my running days

was over. So, I went home to Alabama.

NEWSCASTER

(over television)

Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m.,

as President Reagan was leaving the

Washington Hilton Hotel...

NEWSCASTER

...five or six gunshots were fired

by an unknown would-be assassin. The

President was shot in the chest and

the assailant was immediately tackled

by a half a dozen lawmen. As the

Presidential...

LOUISE

I picked up the mail.

FORREST

Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.

FORREST (V.O.)

One day, out of the blue clear sky,

I got a letter from Jenny...

FORREST

...wondering if I could come down to

Savannah to see her, and that's what

I'm doing here. She saw me on TV,

running, I'm supposed to go on the

Number Nine bus to Richmond Street

and get off and go one block left to

1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

ELDERLY WOMAN

Why, you don't need to take a bus.

Henry Street is just five or six

blocks down that way.

FORREST

Down that way?

ELDERLY WOMAN

Down that way.

FORREST

It was nice talking' to you.

ELDERLY WOMAN

I hope everything works out for you.

JENNY

Hey! Forrest! How you doing?

FORREST

Hi.

JENNY

Come in. Come in.

FORREST

I got your letter.

JENNY

Oh, I was wondering about that.

FORREST

Is this your house?

JENNY

Yeah, it's messy right now. I just

got off work.

FORREST

It's nice. You got air conditioning.

FORREST

Ah...

JENNY

Thank you.

FORREST

I ate some.

JENNY

Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of

your, of your clippings and

everything. There you are. This, I

got your running.

FORREST

I ran a long way. For a long time.

JENNY

There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know

how to say this. Um, I just... I

want to apologize for anything that

I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed

up for a long time, and...

LYNN MARIE

Yoo-hoo.

JENNY

Hey.

LYNN MARIE

Hi.

JENNY

Hey, you. This is an old friend from

Alabama.

LYNN MARIE

Oh, how do you do?

JENNY

Ah, listen, next week my schedule

changes, so I'll be able to... but

thanks for picking up.

LYNN MARIE

No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double

parked.

JENNY

Okay.

LYNN MARIE

Bye.

JENNY

Thanks. This is very good friend,

Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?

LITTLE BOY

Hello, Mr. Gump.

FORREST

Hello.

LITTLE BOY

Now, can I go watch TV now?

JENNY

Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

FORREST

You're a momma, Jenny.

JENNY

I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.

FORREST

Like me.

JENNY

I named him after his Daddy.

FORREST

He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

JENNY

You're his daddy, Forrest.

JENNY

Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at

me, Forrest. There's nothing you

need to do, okay? You didn't do

anything wrong. Okay?

JENNY

Isn't he beautiful?

FORREST

He's the most beautiful thing I've

ever seen. But... is, is he smart,

or is he...

JENNY

He's very smart. He's one of the

smartest in his class.

JENNY

Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

BERT

Oh, great.

ERNIE

Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?

BERT

A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want,

Ernie?

FORREST

What are you watching.

FORREST JR.

Bert and Ernie.

ERNIE

Well, it's the first stage. Bert.

It's planning to write a story, Bert.

I have pencils right here to write

with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper.

I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we

have the paper to write on.

JENNY

Forrest, I'm sick.

FORREST

What, do you have a cough due to

cold?

JENNY

I have some kind virus. And the

doctors don't, they don't know what

it is. And there isn't anything they

can do about it.

FORREST

You could come home with me. Jenny,

you and little Forrest could come

stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll

take care of you if you're sick.

JENNY

Would you marry me, Forrest?

FORREST

Okay.

MINISTER

Please take your seats.

LOUISE

Forrest, it's time to start.

JENNY

Hi. Your tie.

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!

LT. DAN

Hello, Forrest.

FORREST

You got new legs. New legs!

LT. DAN

Yeah, I got new legs.

LT. DAN

Custom-made titanium alloy. It's

what they use on the space shuttle.

FORREST

Magic legs.

LT. DAN

This is my fiancee, Susan.

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan!

SUSAN

Hi, Forrest.

FORREST

Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

JENNY

Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.

MINISTER

Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be

your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

to be your husband? If so, I pronounce

you man and wife.

FORREST

Hey.

JENNY

Hey.

JENNY

Hey, Forrest, were you scared in

Vietnam?

FORREST

Yes. Well, I, I don't know.

FORREST (V.O.)

Sometimes it would stop raining long

enough for the stars to come out.

And then it was nice. It was like

just before the sun goes to bed down

on the bayou...

FORREST (V.O.)

There was over a million sparkles on

the water. Like that mountain lake.

FORREST (V.O.)

It was so clear, Jenny. It looks

like there were two skies, one on

top of the other. And then in the

desert, when the sun comes up...

FORREST (V.O.)

I couldn't tell where heavens stopped

and the earth began. It was so

beautiful.

JENNY

I wish I could have been there with

you.

FORREST

You were.

JENNY

I love you.

FORREST (V.O.)

You died on a Saturday morning.

FORREST

And I had you placed here under our

tree.

FORREST

And I had that house of your father's

bulldozed to the ground.

FORREST (V.O.)

Momma...

FORREST

...always said dyin' was a part of

life.

FORREST

I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest,

he's doing just fine.

FORREST JR.

(reading)

"But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere

they went, the new guests...

FORREST (V.O.)

About to start school again soon. I

make his breakfast, lunch, and

dinner...

FORREST

...every day. I make sure he combs

his hair and brushes his teeth every

day. Teaching him how to play ping

pong.

FORREST

Okay...

FORREST (V.O.)

He's really good.

FORREST

Forrest, you go.

FORREST (V.O.)

We fish a lot.

FORREST

And every night, we read a book.

He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so

proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a

letter, and he says I can't read it.

I'm not supposed to, so I'll just

leave it here for you.

FORREST

Jenny, I don't know if Momma was

right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.

I don't know if we each have a

destiny, or if we're all just floating

around accidental-like on a breeze,

but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe

both is happening at the same time.

I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything

you need, I won't be far away.

FORREST

Here's your bus. Okay.

FORREST

Hey, I know this.

FORREST JR.

I'm gonna show that for show-and-

tell because grandma used to read it

to you.

FORREST

My favorite book.

FORREST

Well...

FORREST

...okay. Hey, there you go.

FORREST

Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to

tell you I love you.

FORREST JR.

I love you too, Daddy.

FORREST

I'll be right here when you get back.

SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER

You understand this is the bus to

school now, don't you?

FORREST JR.

Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris

and I'm Forrest Gump.
