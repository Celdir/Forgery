"HUMAN NATURE"

by

Charlie Kaufman

May 20, 1995

FIRST DRAFT

CUT TO:

LILA

I'm not sorry.

CUT TO:

PUFF

I am sorry.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I don't even know what sorry means

anymore.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LILA

I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest

of my life in jail. So what? I've

been in jail my whole life anyway. A

jail of blood and tissue and coursing

hormones...

LILA

...a jail called the human body.

LILA

My soul held prisoner in this reeking,

stench-ridden bag of bones and

entrails. A bag of feces and piss

and fibroid cysts in my tits and

precancerous moles on my sun-damaged

back...

LILA

At least now I'll be able to blame

the state, not God, for my

incarceration.

CUT TO:

PUFF

I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all

of us. Your's is a complicated, sad

world.

PUFF

And I never knew that. I was living

a life of simplicity, of purity,

when I was ripped out of my Eden and

immersed in this harshness. Some

would argue that the life I was living

was not a human life at all. And,

gentlemen, I don't have any clever

retort. I am not a philosopher. The

only thing I know is that I am sorry,

sorry for my expulsion from Eden,

sorry for my Lila rotting in her

jail cell, and sorry for Nathan...

rotting in his grave.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I don't even know what sorry means

anymore. It's odd. When I was alive

I knew -- maybe it was all I knew --

but here sorry is meaningless. Love

is meaningless. Jealousy is

meaningless. Ambition is meaningless.

Everything that motivated my every

breath while I was alive is

meaningless now.

(beat)

I guess that's how I can be sure I'm

really dead.

CUT TO:

LILA

My story begins when I was twelve.

COP

(checks watch)

Jesus.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

Something terrible happened when I

was twelve.

CUT TO:

KID BROTHER (O.S.)

(muffled)

Hey, no fair!

TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA

Drop dead, Eric.

ADULT LILA (V.O.)

Something terrible started to happen

to my body when I was twelve. My

mother said because of it I would

never be able to get a man, so I

should get used to the idea of

dedicating my life to the pursuit of

knowledge, or religion... or whatever.

ADULT LILA (V.O.)

The doctor said...

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

(to the mother)

It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and

complex thing. It could get worse

with time.

TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA

By the time I was twenty I looked

like an ape.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PUFF

I don't think there's anyone in the

world who doesn't know by now that I

was raised in the wilderness by an

ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who

thought himself an ape, but it amounts

to the same thing gentlemen, does it

not?

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF (V.O.)

My father escaped from a New Jersey

mental institution in 1963.

CUT TO:

PUFF (V.O.)

He had been committed the previous

year after applying one too many

times at our local zoo for the job

of "apprentice ape."

PUFF (V.O.)

My father saw what the human race

had come to while he was... in

captivity. He felt something had to

be done to create a better world.

CUT TO:

PUFF (V.O.)

He stole little me from my mother,

his ex-wife, and raised me, with

love and tenderness and respect, as

an ape like himself.

CUT TO:

PUFF

Apes don't assassinate their

presidents, gentlemen.

CUT TO:

PUFF (V.O.)

Until quite recently I believed myself

to be an ape, although I didn't know

specifically what type. Apes don't

think in terms of type.

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF

It might be argued, gentlemen, that

apes don't even know that they are

apes. In retrospect, however, I'd

say that I was a pygmy chimp.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I have to say I always hated apes.

Of course I don't any longer. I don't

even know what hate means now. But

while alive, I hated apes. I blame

my parents. I mean, I don't blame

them. I don't know what blame is,

really, anymore, but I think they

influenced me in my ape-hating

tendencies.

DISSOLVE TO:

NATHAN AS A BOY

Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys!

MOTHER

(clamping down on his

shoulder)

Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those

are apes. Mountain Gorillas to be

precise.

PUFF'S FATHER

I am not a human being! I am an

animal!

MOTHER

And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.

FATHER

(distracted)

Uh...

(then by rote)

We must never act like apes, son.

For you see, The ape is our closest

biological relative -- specifically

the pygmy chimp.

(holds up the same

illustration of a

pygmy chimp that

Puff showed the

congressional

committee)

A single chromosome separates us.

But you know what truly separates us

from the apes, what makes us better

than apes?

NATHAN AS A BOY

No, papa. What?

FATHER

Culture. Civilization. Refinement.

If we do not have these as humans,

then we might as well be living in

pens and throwing our feces about,

masturbating in public...

(beat, a reverie)

...sniffing red swollen female rump...

MOTHER

Enough, Harold.

CUT TO:

LILA

Oh, I had sexual urges. I had the

urge to merge, officers. Inside I

was 100% Grade A female.

(laughs derisively)

But what self-loathing I felt! Who

would have someone as repulsive, as

unladylike as me? I did everything I

could to shield the world from this

repulsiveness.

DISSOLVE TO:

FEMALE ROOMMATE (O.S.)

Lila, what are you doing in there? I

need to get ready for my date.

LILA

Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!

FEMALE ROOMMATE

Look, I'll just...

(stops in her tracks

when she sees Lila)

What the...?

DISSOLVE TO:

FEMALE ROOMMATE

I don't know why you didn't tell me

about this.

LILA

It's embarrassing, okay?

FEMALE ROOMMATE

It's not so bad.

(beat)

So, it just keeps growing?

LILA

Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.

FEMALE ROOMMATE

Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm

just trying to help.

LILA

How is that helping, Natalie? How

exactly?

FEMALE ROOMMATE

Look, if you're going to be like

that... You should be appreciative

that I'm interested.

LILA

Why, because I'm a freak and you are

beautiful, and you are being nice

enough to come down to my freak,

nonbeautiful level and act concerned

about my repulsive troubles?

FEMALE ROOMMATE

(pegged)

You're fucked up, Lila.

(out the door)

Why don't you fucking try electrolysis

or something? Figure it out for

chrissake.

LILA (V.O.)

At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis

was not a feasible solution. I

explored my alternatives.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

I remember once coming across a

painting of Mary Magdalene entirely

covered with fur. I guess that's

where I got the idea that maybe the

Catholic Church might be a place

that encouraged excessive hair growth

in its women.

LILA (V.O.)

So I became a nun.

LILA

Heavenly Father...

(sighs)

...please let this hair go away.

LILA (V.O.)

But my prayers were always so selfish.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

I tried being a lesbian separatist.

LESBIANS

(chanting)

A woman without a man / Is like a

fish without a bicycle.

LILA (V.O.)

But I guess I just wasn't attracted

to women, even hostile, man-hating,

hairy ones who wore sensible shoes.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

For a while I was a professional

circus freak.

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA (V.O.)

During the holiday season, they made

us wear costumes.

LILA

(depressed)

Ho ho ho.

KID ON HER LAP

That's not real.

LILA

Ow! You little fuck.

LILA (V.O.)

Aside from the great dental, this

occupation was not pleasant.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

They say the holidays are difficult

for a lot of people.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

I decided there was something poetic

about killing myself with a razor

blade.

CUT TO:

LILA

The way that mouse looked at me.

There was no judgement. It didn't

care if I had hair all over my body.

I was just what I was. I felt so

free. Do you understand what I'm

saying?

COP

Something about a mouse, right?

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA (V.O.)

Birds and squirrels and rocks and

trees didn't seem to judge my hair.

I felt at peace when there were no

humans around. I figured out a way

to spend as much time as possible

with no people around. I became a

nature writer.

CUT TO:

LILA

Last night I almost died on this

mountain top, and the irony is I had

never felt more alive.

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

I knew it was coming when in late

afternoon, a thunderhead drifted

over, sneaking in like kids through

the back door of a movie theater,

forced casual. It turned the sky a

queer shade of green. A green that

said "watch out, baby, this is gonna

hurt like hell." I could've

hightailed, but that would be

cheating. Part of the Nature

experience is recognizing its mastery

over you, your smallness in the face

of it.

LILA

As Nietzsche said, what does not

kill me makes me stronger, and that

goes double if you're a woman.

CUT TO:

LILA (V.O.)

I became a successful nature writer.

CUT TO:

LILA

Then I became a famous nature writer.

I said to myself, fuck humanity...

CUT TO:

LILA

...and I became a recluse. I had a

menagerie of animals at my house.

They loved me because I was me. They

loved me on the days I shaved. They

loved me on the days I didn't. For a

while this was enough.

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA (V.O.)

By the time I was thirty I was very,

very horny.

LILA

I had to have a man in my... life.

At any cost. I would become what I

needed to become to achieve this. I

would become a hairless lie.

LILA

I was rich enough for electrolysis

by this time, so I began the long

arduous process of having each

inappropriate hair burned out of my

body at the root.

CUT TO:

LILA

This is when everything changed, and

this is where my confession really

begins.

CUT TO:

ROSE

Progress!

LILA

Ouch. Yeah?

ROSE

Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth

smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a

baby's butt.

LILA

I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a

real girl.

ROSE

You still in the market for a real

boy?

LILA

Always. Ow.

ROSE

(beat)

Cause there's this guy. My brother

knows him. Might be right up your

alley.

LILA

Tell me. I could use someone up my

alley.

ROSE

(playing dumb)

I don't get that. Is that sexual?

LILA

Shut up and tell me.

ROSE

Handsome, thirties, psychologist...

LILA

Loves animals? Ouch. Must love

animals, Rose.

ROSE

Loves animals. Loves you.

LILA

What do you mean?

ROSE

Somehow it came up that you were a

friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal-

loving psychologist said he would

love to meet you.

LILA

Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell

him about the nature of our

relationship, did he?

ROSE

My brother is discreet.

LILA

(rubbing her hand

over her jaw)

Won't he be able to tell?

ROSE

My brother says the guy's a thirty-

five year old virgin, so maybe he

won't know how women usually feel.

Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost

legally blind, which is helpful in

this situation. Plus he's got an

extremely small penis, of which he

is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances

are he'll be so grateful for any non-

judgmental attention, that he'll be

yours forever.

LILA

God, he must be really close to your

brother to tell him such personal

stuff.

ROSE

Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Meditations on a Banana Slug was a

delightful read.

LILA

Thank you so much. I love slugs. All

slugs, not just banana slugs.

NATHAN

As do I.

LILA

They're so even keel. They forge

ahead with slow determination. They

don't get distracted or side-tracked.

They don't care what they look like.

They don't care that people look at

them and go, "Ewww. A slug."

NATHAN

They don't seem to be especially ego

driven, this is true.

LILA

You've got to respect that.

NATHAN

I have to say that I'm not there

yet.

LILA

Where?

NATHAN

Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd

call it. I'm not there yet. I still

have many human characteristics.

LILA

That's not necessarily a bad thing.

NATHAN

Yes. I suppose not. But still. One

would like to move along. To move

beyond.

LILA

I'm not sure we can escape our

natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm

not even so sure anymore that we

should want to.

NATHAN

I love that you said that. It makes

me feel a bit lighter. I've been

rather heavy lately. Thinking about

my childhood. Realizing how much a

product I am of my upbringing.

(beat, cautiously)

I've been seeing someone. A therapist.

LILA

(feigning surprise)

You are a therapist, right?

NATHAN

No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do

research. I'm a behaviorist. I work

with animals. Mice at the moment.

LILA

I hope you don't perform any of those

dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.

NATHAN

Heavens no. My work now is... Right

now I'm teaching mice... well, table

manners, to be candid.

LILA

(beat. doesn't know

what to say)

How's it going?

NATHAN

Quite well, really. It's a lot of

work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly

positive. Right now I've gotten two

of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny

napkins of course.

LILA

Paper or cloth?

NATHAN

I hope you don't think me daft. It's

important work. It's part of a larger

sociological experiment. I'm federally

funded.

LILA

What's the larger experiment?

NATHAN

It's my thesis that if table manners

can be taught to mice, they can be

taught to humans.

LILA

Going out on a limb, aren't you,

Nathan?

NATHAN

(speech)

The truth is most people don't have

table manners today. And when the

foundations of civilized society

crumble and disappear, civilized

society in its entirely follows

closely at its heels.

LILA

I'm not sure.

NATHAN

(stridently)

Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all

sadly lacking from our daily

intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity,

meanness are the norm.

LILA

We are animals after all.

NATHAN

Ergo if I can teach table manners to

mice, I can teach them to humans. If

I can teach table manners to humans,

I can save the world.

CUT TO:

ROSE

So?

LILA

I really like him, Rose. He's so...

(searching)

...passionate about his work.

ROSE

My brother says he likes you, too.

LILA

(pleased)

Really?

ROSE

Yeah. Says he likes you even more

than he likes his own mother. And

according to my brother Nathan's

abormally close with his mother.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I began going to a therapist when I

was in my thirties, because I felt

that I wasn't enjoying life the way

my friends were.

(beat)

After a time my childhood came up.

DISSOLVE TO:

FATHER

Lord, we thank you for this bountiful

gift we are about to receive.

ALL

Amen.

MOTHER

My God, no! My God!

(disappointed)

Oh, Nathan.

MOTHER

That is the wrong fork, young man.

(to father)

Harold, tell the boy.

FATHER

That is the wrong fork, young man.

NATHAN AS A BOY

(panicky)

I'll use the right one. I'm sorry. I

forgot.

MOTHER

Harold, tell the boy more.

FATHER

Too late. Go to your room.

NATHAN AS A BOY

But...

MOTHER

Harold! Tell the boy again.

FATHER

(looking at mother)

No "buts." Go to your room now.

MOTHER

(looking at father)

And?

FATHER

And think about what you've done.

DISSOLVE TO:

WENDALL

And do you think maybe this early

childhood indoctrination has something

to do with your interest in table

manners in the present.

NATHAN

I don't think so. No.

NATHAN

Why do you ask?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LILA

It looks wonderful.

NATHAN

You look wonderful. I'm on top of

the world tonight, Lila. Work is

going splendidly and my personal

life is ...

LILA

Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is

delish...

NATHAN

(clenched teeth)

My God! The fork! The fork!

LILA

I'm sorry?

NATHAN

(strangely)

Tell her, Harold...

(stops himself)

It's just that... It's nothing. It's

just that the outside fork is the

salad fork. One goes from the outside

in as the dinner progresses.

LILA

Oh, I'm sorry.

(picks up correct

fork)

I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really

learned those things.

NATHAN

(forced casual)

No biggie.

LILA

Boy, this is good!

NATHAN

I'm sorry that I became so upset.

LILA

No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward

in certain areas.

NATHAN

(beat, blurting)

It's only that I really enjoy your

company and...

LILA

You do?

NATHAN

Yes, and...

LILA

You really enjoy my company?

NATHAN

Yes.

(beat, blurting)

Please don't talk with food in your

mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty

and it only mars your... I'm sorry.

I'm being critical.

NATHAN

It's just that I have some

peculiarities, and...

LILA

I like you, too, Nathan.

NATHAN

You do?

LILA

Yeah

(beat)

But I have some peculiarities also.

NATHAN

(happily)

I don't care. I don't care!

(then, concerned)

Like what, for example?

LILA

Like nothing.

CUT TO:

ROSE

My brother says things are going

really well between you and Nathan.

LILA

I cannot believe how in love I am

with this man.

ROSE

Yeah?

LILA

He's so cute. I even like his cute

little penis. It's like a little

pig's penis or something.

(beat)

Rose, we connect on every level.

I've finally found someone I can

feel completely safe with.

ROSE

Don't throw that away. I had that

once with a guy. But I threw it away

for a cheap thrill.

LILA

One night stand?

ROSE

No. I married a midget.

LILA

Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?

ROSE

Well he wasn't really a midget. He

was on the cusp of midgethood. That's

what made it cheap. Had he been an

actual midget, there would've been

nothing cheap about it, my dear.

LILA

I didn't know you were into that

sort of thing.

ROSE

Let me tell you, honey, midgets are

the best kept secret in male

companionship. They're portable.

They're controllable. They're eager.

And they're exactly the right height

for a little covert oral fun on the

dance floor.

LILA

(screams with delight,

then:)

I have a friend you might like to

meet.

ROSE

Oh?

LILA

Three foot one.

ROSE

Be still my crotch.

LILA

Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's

asked me to move in with him.

ROSE

Yeah. My brother told me.

LILA

And I think I'm going to.

ROSE

(mulling it over)

Stand on a stepladder sometimes.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Lila moved in with me. Did I love

her? I thought so. But from my new

vantage point I realize that love is

nothing more than a messy

conglomeration of need, desperation,

fear of death, insecurity about penis

size, and the self-involved, ego

driven need to collect other people's

hearts. Not that I judge it.

(puts head in hands.

beat. looks up)

Listen, I don't want to be dead yet.

Is there any way to...

NATHAN

No I suppose not.

(beat)

No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We

had our problems, but we both wanted

love so badly, we turned a blind

eye.

LILA

It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr.

and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so

much about you and I've seen you in

photographs from Nathan's childhood,

but it's nice to meet you in the

flesh. I must say, you look exactly

the same as in the photographs.

MOTHER

Thank you, dear.

NATHAN

Actually, Mother and Father, you

look very, very old. You look

terrible.

LILA

Nathan!

MOTHER

Tell him, Harold.

FATHER

Son, your mother and I are doing a

production of The Gin Game at the

local community theater. We forgot

to take off our make-up.

LILA

(awkward)

Goodness, you two look exactly as

you did in those old photos.

MOTHER

(cold)

Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear.

NATHAN

(changing the subject)

Lila's a nature writer, mother.

MOTHER

I love nature. As long as it stays

in the zoo where it belongs.

MOTHER

(to Lila)

Don't you agree, dear?

NATHAN

Of course she does, mother.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

What are you doing in there?

LILA (O.S.)

(pissy)

I'll be out in a minute.

NATHAN

I'm sorry about my parents.

LILA (O.S.)

You didn't seem sorry when you were

laughing at all your mother's stupid,

tasteless, cruel animal jokes.

NATHAN

I was simply attempting to keep the

evening light. You know that I feel

similarly to you about nature.

LILA (O.S.)

Do you?

NATHAN

Of course.

(beat)

I simply love the... naturalness of

it all.

LILA

Do you? Oh do you, darling?

NATHAN

Why certainly!

LILA

Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's

celebrate with a long hike in the

woods tomorrow!

NATHAN

(oh shit)

That's a great idea.

LILA

It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my

old stomping grounds!

NATHAN

Terrific. Can't wait!

NATHAN

Shaving cream?

LILA

I don't think so.

(beat)

Why?

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Darling, did you bring the insect

repellent lotion?

LILA

Yes, darling.

NATHAN

(beat)

Oh, and the sun block?

LILA

Of course.

NATHAN

What SPF, sweetie?

LILA

Fifteen.

NATHAN

Perfectomundo! We are ready!

(beat)

Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to

have an insect repellent lotion that

also worked as a sun block? Think of

all the time one would save.

LILA

Yes, darling.

NATHAN

I think I'll get Johannsen in

chemistry on that.

(beat)

Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?

LILA

Yes.

NATHAN

Flares?

LILA

Absolutely.

NATHAN

We could call it "Quit Bugging Me,

Sunny."

(laughs a lot)

Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.

LILA

(laughs appreciatively)

That's very funny.

NATHAN

I love you so much.

CUT TO:

PUFF

Then, gentlemen, one day I saw

something I hadn't seen since my

father died in a freak accident

involving a rotted log and four

thousand bees stinging his head... I

saw other human beings. They chattered

away at each other in what appeared

to be gibberish. Later I learned it

was English. Now I wonder if perhaps

my initial assessment hadn't been

correct.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

LILA

It was a flash of white. I ruled out

deer immediately. Too... upright.

CUT TO:

LILA

Did you see that?

NATHAN

What?

LILA

I don't know. Something.

NATHAN

A deer?

LILA

No. Too... upright. Might've been a

person.

NATHAN

(nervously)

It might behoove us to turn back at

this point.

LILA

Come on.

NATHAN

(not budging)

If it's a person, why should we go

see it? It's not like it's nature or

anything. It's just a person.

(beat)

Sometimes people who live in the

woods don't want to be seen. They

live in the woods because they're

anti-social, Lila. We have to respect

that.

NATHAN

This is the way to get ticks, Lila.

This is it. Bingo! Lyme Disease!

You've hit the nail on the head here.

NATHAN

Oh for God's sa...

CUT TO:

PUFF

I had never seen anything like it.

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF (V.O.)

It was an ape as I had never seen

before. Like me, yet different in

certain essential details. And all

at once I felt a heat pass through

me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I

wanted to touch her, to caress her,

to be one with her. I had urges and

desires I could not explain. I felt

overwhelmed by the power this strange

creature had over me, and so I did

what any animal would do when it

comes across an animal of superior

strength...

CUT TO:

LILA

He bolted.

CUT TO:

LILA

Who are you?

LILA

You don't understand my language, do

you?

LILA

(laughing)

I take it back, you do understand my

language.

LILA

Oh God.

NATHAN

Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put

something on.

NATHAN

You'll catch cold. It's cold.

(beat)

What do you suppose he is, a

survivalist?

LILA

I think he's feral.

NATHAN

(jumping back)

Feral? Don't touch him! He might be

diseased! He might... My God, rabies!

LILA

He looks perfectly fine.

NATHAN

I think we should go. Please. Before

he wakes up and, I don't know, eats

us, or whatever feral things do.

LILA

I don't understand you. This is

fascinating and you just want to run

away. I mean, here we have a human

being totally uncontaminated by

civilization, totally free, and all

you want to do is run back to your...

NATHAN

(thinking)

Actually, I just had an amusing

thought.

LILA

What?

NATHAN

(musing)

Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?

LILA

Look at him. He doesn't understand

English. He moves like an animal.

NATHAN

It's perfect!

LILA

Nathan, what the hell are you talking

about?

NATHAN

(doing a little dance)

Forget mice! Actually forget guinea

pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also.

I'm on to stage five: The human

subject.

LILA

Oh no. You can't take him from his

home, Nathan.

NATHAN

(ranting)

Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa,

my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to

the top of the Behaviorist food chain.

He's going to make me famous.

LILA

I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's

happy here.

NATHAN

Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy

and naked alone in this tick infested

wilderness? Never to know the love

of a good woman, never to revel in

the pitter-patter of little feet,

never to read Moby Dick, or marvel

at a Monet, or just sit back after a

day of hard but rewarding work, smoke

a pipe, and wonder about the nature

of reality.

LILA

(weakening resolve)

You'd be taking away his freedom,

Nathan.

NATHAN

Freedom's just another word for

nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote

Janet Jackson.

NATHAN

Belonging to something, a person or

a society, is a basic human craving.

We are communal creatures. This poor

soul has no one, nothing...

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You

give me this beautiful gift, this

glorious sunset. But with no one to

say "isn't that a beautiful sunset"

to, it becomes meaningless, just

another stupid sunset. They happen

everyday. So what?

DISSOLVE TO:

NATHAN

...what is it that makes us human,

if not the knowledge that we are

indeed human? Think of this poor

soul's education as the greatest

gift we could bestow upon...

LILA

All right.

NATHAN

Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw

him in the trunk.

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

Doctor...

NATHAN

Good morning.

NATHAN

(to Gabrielle)

Only three shocks. A chimp takes

fifteen. This is going to be tres

simple, no, Gabrielle?

GABRIELLE

(in love with Nathan)

Oui, doctor, oui.

NATHAN

(to Puff)

Good morning...

(to Gabrielle)

We need a name for him, don't we?

GABRIELLE

Oui.

NATHAN

You decide. Today is your day.

GABRIELLE

Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet

little mongrel puppie named Puff

when I was a girl. This one reminds

me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!

(giggles girlishly)

I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.

NATHAN

(charmed)

Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is

that okay?

GABRIELLE

Oui. Perfect!

NATHAN

(to Puff)

Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr.

Bronfman and this is my assistant

Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy

while you are here.

NATHAN

(to Puff)

How about some salad, son?

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!

NATHAN

Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE

(out of breath)

Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I

very much enjoy working with you.

(blushes)

Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.

NATHAN

No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing

that. You're a terrific assistant.

GABRIELLE

Merci. I... Do you... would you like

to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?

NATHAN

Well, I don't know. I'm actually on

my way to...

GABRIELLE

Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive

me. I should not have asked such a

stupid question. I know you are a

very important man and...

NATHAN

No. Don't be silly. It's just...

GABRIELLE

I am a foolish little thing. I am

pink in my face, no? It is only that

I have been so lonely lately and...

I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow,

okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

Thank you so much for accompanying

me.

NATHAN

Not at all.

GABRIELLE

I have had such a difficult time in

my personal life and you seem to be

such a nice man... but I'm talking

too much again, no?

NATHAN

Of course not.

GABRIELLE

You're so sweet. Oh, why are there

not more men out there like you?

NATHAN

There there.

GABRIELLE

You know just the right thing to

say.

NATHAN

Listen, you're the best assistant

I've ever had... Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE

(smiles)

I like it when you say my name. Is

that stupid?

CUT TO:

NATHAN

What are you doing in there?

LILA (O.S.)

Nothing. Be right out.

NATHAN

Hello?

(beat, happily)

Oh, hi... Gabrielle!

LILA (O.S.)

Who is it?

NATHAN

Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

LILA (O.S.)

Who is it?

NATHAN

(into phone)

Absolutely, Gabrielle.

(covering phone,

testily)

Someone from work!

(into phone)

Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh.

Exactly.

LILA (O.S.)

Who from work?

NATHAN

(into phone)

Excuse me one second, would you,

Gabrielle?

LILA (O.S.)

Who is it, Nathan?

NATHAN

Look, Lila, when I'm on a work...

LILA

Nathan, I...

CUT TO:

LILA (O.S.)

It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help

it. I'm sorry.

NATHAN (O.S.)

Your entire body?

LILA (O.S.)

I'm getting electrolysis. It's

working, but it takes time. So

meanwhile I have to...

NATHAN (O.S.)

You have to shave? Like an ape?

LILA (O.S.)

(crying)

Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!

NATHAN (O.S.)

Don't quibble. You know what I mean.

LILA (O.S.)

I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me

for this.

NATHAN (O.S.)

Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!

LILA (O.S.)

I'm the same person I was before you

knew, damn it! Oh God!

NATHAN (O.S.)

I have to think! I have to think!

LILA (O.S.)

Oh God, why... do... I... have...

to... be... like... Oh, no! Oh, shit!

(rustling sound, then

into phone)

Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who's

there?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I don't get it. I don't get it. I

don't get it. How could I find myself

in this mess? This is a mess. This

is not a situation I understand.

This is a mess. How do I extricate

myself from this mess? Is my

girlfriend a man? I don't understand.

This is not part of any plan. She

deceived me. She has hair.

(beat)

But am I being fair? So what if she

has hair? Who am I to judge? I have

hair.

(beat)

But I'm supposed to have hair. I am

a man. Men are supposed to have hair.

(beat)

But poor Lila. Think of what she's

had to go through. The courage she's

had to have in the face of this

abomination of nature. I should love

her all the more. I should love every

hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't

mind that I have a mortifyingly

small...

GABRIELLE

Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry

to disturb you. I just came for some

papers I left.

NATHAN

Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled

you. I came to think.

(beat, remembering)

God, Did I hang up on you?

GABRIELLE

Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time.

I am sorry.

NATHAN

No. I just got distracted. I'm so

sorry.

GABRIELLE

Is everything fine?

NATHAN

Oui.

(laughs)

Now you've got me talking French.

GABRIELLE

(laughs)

I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered

I left some papers I need to go over.

(opens overcoat to

reveal lingerie)

See? I rushed right out of the house.

I must look a mess. I'm so

embarrassed.

NATHAN

(taken)

I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?

GABRIELLE

Coincidence, yes?

(beat)

And how is our son?

NATHAN

Our...? Oh!

(laughs, out of control)

He seems fine. I guess we woke him.

The lights and all.

GABRIELLE

I should turn them off.

(she does)

Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama

sang to me when I was a little girl.

NATHAN

(a little giddy)

When you were a little French girl?

GABRIELLE

Oui.

NATHAN

(back in control)

That would be good.

GABRIELLE

(quietly to Nathan)

There.

GABRIELLE

Shall we close up, then?

NATHAN

Maybe we should just sit for a while.

It's very peaceful.

GABRIELLE

It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into

you, both in our silly pajamas. It

is two happy coincidences, no?

NATHAN

Yes. Happy happy.

GABRIELLE

Yet you look so sad. A great man

like you should not be sad.

NATHAN

I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.

GABRIELLE

I am sleepy.

NATHAN

I shouldn't say this, but you're

pretty, Gabrielle. It's

unprofessional, I know.

GABRIELLE

Really? I always think myself so

ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A

wallflower.

NATHAN

(buying her line)

Really? No. Not at all. You're a

very pretty girl. You should know

that. You should be confident.

GABRIELLE

Thank you so much. Merci. It's very

wonderful to hear a man say such a

nice compliment.

NATHAN

It's true. I wouldn't lie.

GABRIELLE

You are sweet.

GABRIELLE

(vaguely protesting)

Doctor.

NATHAN

So soft. So smooth.

(back to reality)

I'm sorry. It's just...

GABRIELLE

(soothing)

Shh.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Was that okay? I mean, was I able

to... satisfy you?

LILA

You are an animal.

NATHAN

Really? Wow! That's that's terrific

to hear from someone so... feminine,

so female.

LILA

I love being female because it, how

do you say, allows me to be close to

men.

NATHAN

I'm glad you're female.

(beat)

Do you think our boy witnessed the

primal scene?

GABRIELLE

Anyway it's time he grew up. N'est-

ce pa?

(sighing, running her

fingers along his

chest)

I love chest hair on a man. I know

it isn't fashionable now, hairy men.

But to me it is the very sign of

masculinity.

GABRIELLE

What is wrong, my darling?

NATHAN

Nothing, my darling. All is right

with the world.

PUFF

I saw it, gentlemen. I saw the whole

sweaty, passionate, ugly, beautiful

act, and to use the vernacular, I

wanted me some of that.

PUFF

And I think I understood from that

moment, that in order to get some, I

would have to do what they said. In

order to experience this primal,

basic, animal thing, I would first

have to become a civilized, prissy,

uptight human. I would have to become

Nathan.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

(slow. talking to an

idiot)

Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you're

with excuses herself to go powder

her nose.

NATHAN

Perfect. Perfect, Puff!

GABRIELLE

(still giggling)

Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment

please.

(puts it on hold)

Lila.

NATHAN

Shit.

(takes phone)

Hi, honey.

CUT TO:

LILA

So, how's it going today?

NATHAN (O.S.)

Good. Making progress.

LILA

Honey, can we talk tonight? You know,

about stuff? Things have been so

strained for the past three weeks,

since you know, and I just want to

talk.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Everything's fine, honey. We don't

need to talk. Besides I have to work

late.

LILA (O.S.)

Please, Nathan. I really need this.

You've been working late a lot.

NATHAN

Okay, we'll have dinner tonight.

NATHAN

Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven.

Bye.

(hangs up)

What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed

to do?

GABRIELLE

(disgusted)

I don't know, Nathan. What are you

supposed to do?

NATHAN

You don't abandon somebody because

they have a physical problem.

GABRIELLE

Funny. I thought that's exactly what

you did. You just don't have the

courage to admit it to yourself.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead.

One would've hoped... But alas. You

know, I really did love Lila. But

with her... problem... and then when

Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And

Gabrielle was so... conventionally

female. And she had an accent. I was

lost from that moment on. But

Gabrielle was right. I couldn't admit

it to myself, this shallowness of

character, let alone to Lila.

CUT TO:

LILA

Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan?

I just have to know.

NATHAN

Of course not.

LILA

It would just be helpful to know.

NATHAN

No.

LILA

Because, you know, you seem so

distant. And you work late every

night. And we hardly ever have sex,

and when we do, it's... I don't know.

It feels different.

NATHAN

I'm just preoccupied.

LILA

Do you like my new look?

NATHAN

Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

LILA

I'm trying, you know.

(starting to cry)

I'm trying to be what you want. I

want to be what you want, Nathan.

All I want is to be what you want.

NATHAN

(embarrassed)

Shh. It's okay.

(takes her hand)

It's okay, Lila. You're what I want.

You know that. You're exactly what I

want.

LILA

(hopefully, sniffing)

Really?

NATHAN

Sure. Of course.

LILA

Because I'm really trying, you know.

Rosie says maybe only another two

years of the elctrolysis.

NATHAN

(hard to stomach)

That's great.

LILA

I've signed up for a ballet class.

And look at my nails! A real girl!

NATHAN

That's great. It's a great color for

you.

LILA

Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NATHAN

So anyway, that's the nightmare I've

been having lately.

WENDALL

Do you suppose it has anything to do

with Lila's unusually hairy body?

NATHAN

(beat)

No, why?

WENDALL

Well, it seems that since Lila

broached the subject of children,

you've been on edge and I know you

have an issue with the, uh, body

hair.

NATHAN

(revelation)

Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to

think about. That's very good. That's

what you get the big bucks, right?

Ha ha.

WENDALL

I just think it might be important

to explore your feelings for Lila.

NATHAN

I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful

person. And... she loves me! That's

no small potatoes. I mean she really

loves me. She's sacrificed so much

to be in this relationship with me.

And she's a good person. A truly

good person. How rare is that in

this world, eh? And how could I stop

loving somebody because of a little

physical imperfection, if it can

even be called that. I mean, God

knows I'm not perfect! What about my

eyesight? It's lousy, that's what!

Lila's not going to leave me because

of my eyesight. What about my penis?

WENDALL

And how do you feel about Gabrielle?

CUT TO:

PUFF

Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent-

elmen.

NATHAN

Bravo, Puff! Bravo!

NATHAN

Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?

GABRIELLE

Hmmmph.

NATHAN

Gabby, what is it?

GABRIELLE

Hmmph. Hmmph.

(beat)

Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

NATHAN

Fine.

GABRIELLE

Not in front of the boy.

NATHAN

Very well.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

My little French.

GABRIELLE

(pushing him away)

Stop. Get away.

NATHAN

What is it?

GABRIELLE

You have to choose Nathan. It's like

Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's

choice. Did you ever see that movie,

Sophie's Choice? It is like that.

Only it is this.

NATHAN

Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort

things out.

GABRIELLE

(hard)

No! It is now that you must decide.

(soft)

I love you, Doctor Nathan...

(hard)

...but I will not wait. I will not

be your chippy. I will not be your

little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side

dish.

(soft)

My love. I want to have a sweet tiny

baby inside my belly... from you.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NATHAN

I love you so much, Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE

But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.

NATHAN

But I don't know how to leave Lila.

NATHAN

(quietly)

Now there's a butt, Nathan.

CUT TO:

LILA

Oh!

(laughs)

I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!

(runs over and kisses

him)

You're like a boy sneaking in...

NATHAN

(so bored)

...the back door of a movie theater.

Yes, indeed.

LILA

You remember that from my book? I'm

touched!

(kisses him again)

What's wrong?

NATHAN

Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.

LILA

I'll make it.

(beats him to the

portable bar)

I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's

going to be so great! Scotch on the

rocks, right?

(giggles)

Just kidding. I know what you drink,

mister. I know what you drink.

(pours and blends and

shakes, etc.)

Voila!

NATHAN

Thanks.

LILA

(fishing)

How's work?

NATHAN

Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?

LILA

(pouty)

No. I don't want your work to be

cruddy.

NATHAN

My assistant quit today. Okay? He

was highly valuable to the project.

LILA

Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire

somebody else?

NATHAN

I guess.

LILA

Hey! I could come work for you! I

know I haven't been all that

supportive of this project, but I've

come around.

NATHAN

Have you?

LILA

Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a

wonderful project you're doing, taking

this poor unfortunate, uncivilized

creature and turning him into a human

being! What a wonderful wonderful

compassionate man you are!

NATHAN

Really?

LILA

Yes! And I want to help. You won't

have to pay me, and I was thinking

of giving up that crazy nature writing

anyway.

NATHAN

How come?

LILA

Who needs it? I have you and I have

being a woman and I have thinking

about womanly things! I love being a

woman because...

NATHAN

Such as what womanly things?

LILA

Such as my man and how to please

him!

(kisses him)

Such as making wonderful dinners for

my man!

(kisses him again,

leads him to the

table, sits him down)

Such as looking pretty for my man!

(kisses him again)

And I'm writing an article on quilting

for the Ladies Home Journal!

CUT TO:

LILA

I had sold my fucking soul.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I let her sell her soul. I stood by

as she did it. It's inexcusable.

(beat)

At the time though I thought it might

help.

CUT TO:

PUFF

When she came to work with Nathan,

she seemed different, gentlemen, I

don't know, somehow soulless.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Bravo to you, Puff!

LILA

That was wonderful!

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

You were wonderful today, darling.

Such authority with the ape-man boy.

It made me so hot for you.

NATHAN

Unnhh.

GABRIELLE

The way you are taming him, it sends

chills down my girlish spine and...

everywhere else, too.

NATHAN

Urgh.

GABRIELLE

Take me, darling! Tame your little

monkey of love!

LILA

(sighing)

Well, I'm tamed, Dr. Bronfman.

NATHAN

I'm glad... my assistant.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I think he's ready.

LILA

Oh boy!

PUFF

(jumping up)

Oh boy!

NATHAN

Now, Puff, we're leaving on the

electronic collar. I don't think

we'll need to shock you, but just in

case.

PUFF

Okay. That's fair.

NATHAN

No, Puff! Bad!

PUFF

My apologies, madam.

LILA

It's okay, Puff.

PUFF

Shan't happen again.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

This is great, Puff. You're doing

fine.

PUFF

I'm loving this. It's such a treat

to be out and about. What a wonderful

invention a city is. The immense

buildings of glass and steel glinting

in the afternoon sun, the smartly

dressed women in their best summer

frocks, the colorful street vendors.

WAITRESS

How is everything?

PUFF

Just spectacular. Great salmon.

Fantastico! You've got to give me

the recipe! My compliments to the

chef!

WAITRESS

I'm glad you...

NATHAN

Puff, no!

WAITRESS

And will that be all today?

CUT TO:

PUFF

It shan't happen again. I swear it.

I'm just getting my sea legs, you

know.

LILA

(patting Puff on the

back)

It's an animal urge, Puff. It's

nothing to be ashamed of.

NATHAN

Lila! Tell him.

LILA

(to Puff)

You just have to control it. We're

not apes.

NATHAN

Thank you very much for that.

CUT TO:

PUFF

I don't think this aversion therapy

is really necessary, doctor. I

understand the problem.

NATHAN

Humor me, Puff. It's essential that

I am able to trust you to function

independently in the world.

PUFF

I bow to your expertise in these

matters.

NATHAN

Lila?

NATHAN

Good. You're doing fine.

NATHAN

Excellent.

NATHAN

You're doing very nicely, Puff. I'm

pleased.

NATHAN

Great...

PUFF

(unimpressed)

Eh.

NATHAN

Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert

tonight.

PUFF

Yahoo!

NATHAN

Tomorrow, the acid test.

CUT TO:

CHESTER'S WAITRESS

How you all doin' today?

NATHAN

(cheerily)

Very well.

LILA

(awkwardly)

Very well.

PUFF

(looking down)

Very well.

CHESTER'S WAITRESS

Good enough! What can I get for you?

NATHAN

Puff, why don't you order first?

PUFF

(looking at menu)

Uh, what's a Reuben, please?

CHESTER'S WAITRESS

The what, honey? Oh, the Reuben?

That's a sandwich with corned beef

and sauer...

PUFF

That's fine. That's what I'll have.

Corned beef is a good food.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Puff, I'm proud of you! You did

remarkably well under difficult

circumstances.

LILA

Absolutely!

PUFF

Did I? I tried so hard! I really

concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!

NATHAN

And because you did so well, we have

a little surprise for you.

PUFF

(happily)

Extra dessert?

NATHAN

Even better.

CUT TO:

NATHAN AND LILA

Surprise!

NATHAN

Free to come and go as you please.

There's some "mad money" in the night

table drawer.

PUFF

(taking the key,

hugging Nathan)

It's wonderful! Do you think I'm

ready? Do you really?

NATHAN

I trust that you'll make good, mature

decisions. I trust that you'll do

the proper thing.

PUFF

Oh, I will!

(gravely)

Your very trust has instilled an

enormous sense of responsibility in

me. I don't want to disappoint you.

NATHAN

Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't

ever do what you really want to do.

PUFF

(taking it in)

Got it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I'm going to go down and check on

Puff. See how he's holding up.

LILA

(stretching)

Should I come with?

NATHAN

Nah. You just relax. How's the book?

LILA

(lazily, happily)

Ummm. It's good.

NATHAN

I won't be long.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

(into phone)

You're kidding! Holy shit.

(beat)

Yeah, no duh! I had a wild hair up

my ass over that for a month.

GABRIELLE

Yeah? What?

NATHAN (O.S.)

Hi. It's Nathan.

GABRIELLE

(into phone)

Call you back.

(hangs up, assumes

French accent)

You bastard! What do you want?

NATHAN (O.S.)

I just want to talk.

GABRIELLE

(ripping off her

nightshirt)

We have nothing to say! You are a

rotten bastard, that's what!

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Please. Just one minute of your time.

GABRIELLE (O.S.)

Why? You've made your decision, Mister

Stinky American! Now I hate you! No,

I don't hate you; I don't even think

about you!

NATHAN

I've got some things to tell you.

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

Like what?

NATHAN (O.S.)

Well, I think it would be easier if

I could talk to you in person.

GABRIELLE

What for?

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Well, I think...

GABRIELLE (O.S.)

You think too much. I need a man who

doesn't think so much but acts more

than he thinks... is what I need!

NATHAN

What?

GABRIELLE

You heard me! You make me sick when

you pretend to not understand what I

am saying to you! Go away from here!

NATHAN

(turning away)

Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered

you.

GABRIELLE (O.S.)

(beat, then screaming)

All right, already! Come in if you

must! The door's open, you son of a

bitch!

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE (O.S.)

In here, you lousy piece of merde.

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

(testy)

Well?

NATHAN

God, you're beautiful.

GABRIELLE

Please. I look a mess.

NATHAN

No. You look so beautiful.

GABRIELLE

Anyway. Come already to the point.

NATHAN

I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I

can't stop thinking about you.

GABRIELLE

I've moved on.

NATHAN

No!

GABRIELLE

I've been seeing Johannsen in

chemistry.

NATHAN

(raging)

That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the

one who gave him the idea for the

combination bug spray-sun screen!

Did you know that?!

GABRIELLE

(calm, dismissive)

That's not how he tells it.

NATHAN

Of course not, that Swedish thief!

He's a thief of hearts!

(beat)

I love you, Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE

(dismissive)

Hunh.

NATHAN

Just give me some time to let Lila

down easily. She's a really nice

girl and I don't want to hurt her

more than is necessary.

GABRIELLE

(beat)

You hurt me, you know, when you made

Nathan's Choice. Does that not even

matter to you, you pig?

NATHAN

Can you ever forgive me?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Hey.

LILA

You were gone a long time.

NATHAN

(sits down next to

her)

Yeah. Puff and I got into a big,

philosophical discussion. He's really

quite well read, considering he's

only been literate for a month now.

He's going to make us famous, Lila.

LILA

So he's doing okay?

NATHAN

Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying

his new digs.

LILA

That's funny because, you know, I

just went and picked him up at some

flophouse on the lower eastside. He

called here when he ran out of his

"mad" money after spending an entire

evening drinking, watching strippers,

and fucking a whore!

(then casually)

Oh, and what did you do tonight,

honey?

NATHAN

Shit.

LILA

And what did you do tonight, honey?

NATHAN

I've fallen in love with somebody

else, Lila.

LILA

(pointedly)

And what did you do tonight, honey?

NATHAN

I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her.

I'm sorry. But that's what the hell

I did.

LILA

(standing)

Do you know what I gave up to be

with you?

NATHAN

Yes.

LILA

I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I

gave up my body hair!

NATHAN

Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human

heart is a strange thing.

LILA

How the hell would you know anything

about the human heart?

NATHAN

(moving to her)

Lila...

LILA

How's that for ladylike, Nathan.

CUT TO:

LILA

For two weeks I holed myself up in a

motel room. I didn't even know who I

was. My world had crumbled. There is

nothing that makes you feel dirtier

than finally deciding to sell your

soul and finding no buyers.

CUT TO:

LILA

No maid service! For God's sake,

can't you read the fucking "do not

disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?

ROSE (O.S.)

Lila, it's Rosie.

LILA

(beat)

Go the fuck away, Rosie.

ROSE (O.S.)

Please, honey, let me in.

LILA

Rose, please go away.

ROSE (O.S.)

Lila, I want to help you.

LILA

How'd you know where I was?

ROSE

Nathan told my brother.

LILA

Your brother should have his license

revoked.

ROSE

Yeah, although I'm not going to turn

him in. I like hearing the dirt.

LILA

(suddenly crying)

Why didn't your brother tell you

that Nathan was having an affair?

ROSE

I don't know, honey. I don't know.

Maybe he just didn't want to get

involved.

LILA

Oh, Rosie.

ROSE

Let's get you out of here. Come stay

with me until you get your strength

back.

(cheerily)

Free electrolysis, if you want it!

We'll get that face of yours cleared

up in no time.

LILA

Yeah. I gotta get myself together. I

want to look good. If I'm gonna fuck

with Nathan, and I am, I want him to

want to fuck me when I do it.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

BEARDED PSYCHOLOGIST

...and so without further ado, I

give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and

Puff.

NATHAN

Thank you. Let's get right to it.

Here we have Puff the day of his

capture.

NATHAN

And here he is today, a scant three

months later.

NATHAN

Puff, why don't you say a few words

to the assemblage.

PUFF

It would be my pleasure, doctor.

(behind podium)

Distinguished gentlemen and ladies

of the psychological community, I

stand before you today, a living

testament to the amazing skill of

Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he

took me from crayons to perfume would

be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman

took me from playing with my own

feces, then to crayons, and then to

an appreciation of the complex works

of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and

Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive

masturbation to...

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF (O.S.)

And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we

meet again, au revoir.

GABRIELLE

You were wonderful!

NATHAN

Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?

GABRIELLE

Don't be silly!

(hugs Puff)

And you were wonderful, too! I loved

the way you said " au revoir."

NATHAN

Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Now the tango.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I think it went swimmingly today.

You two make an excellent team.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PUFF

To be taken from the depths of

ignorance and depravity and raised

to heights of culture and refinement!

This is the priceless gift bestowed

upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROSE

Done!

LILA

(standing triumphantly)

Ready!

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

(off clipboard)

So we've got seventeen new bookings

for speaking engagements, my wonderful

men.

NATHAN

Terrific. We're all going to be rich

and famous.

PUFF

Thanks to you, Nate.

NATHAN

Thanks to you, Buddy. And your

diligence and intelligence and

perseverance.

NATHAN

(to Gabrielle)

And of course to you, my sweet, for

your... moral support.

PUFF

(applauding)

here, here.

MIDGET

Excuse me, are you Dr. Bronfman?

PUFF

Is that a little boy?

NATHAN

(teaching)

No, Puff. This man is a midget. In

actuality, they prefer to be called

"Little People." Isn't that correct,

my good man?

MIDGET

Yes sir. Little People.

NATHAN

This Little Person is actually a

fully grown adult man, Puff, believe

it or not, who, due to a genetic

anomaly, is miniature but perfectly

proportioned.

(to midget)

Turn, please.

PUFF

(jotting in notebook)

Interesting.

NATHAN

Now, my diminutive friend, what can

I do for you?

MIDGET

You can get into that goddamn Lucite

bachelor pad for starters, Goliath.

MIDGET

(to Puff)

Not you, Joyboy.

NATHAN

What is this about? We have no money

on these premises. Please if you are

from some little person terrorist

fringe group...

MIDGET

(loud and scary)

Shut up!

NATHAN

Lila?

GABRIELLE

That's Lila?

LILA

Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt.

And don't let the hirsutism fool

you. I know more about being a woman,

and more about the black hearts of

men than you, in your pretty little

powdered, bullshit fantasy world,

can ever imagine. I know the darkness

and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.

NATHAN

Lila, you don't intend to hurt us,

do you?

LILA

Eat shit, thumbtack dick!

(to Midget)

Thank you, Frank. You're the best.

MIDGET

Anything for you, Lila.

LILA

See, Frank and I are kindred spirits.

We both know what it's like to be

shunned because of our appearance.

We both know how easily that turns

into self-hatred.

MIDGET

Amen. Praise the Lord and pass the

ammunition!

ROSE

(to Lila)

Sorry I'm late, parking is a bitch

at this place.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.

ROSE

With pleasure.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROSE

I'm going to miss you.

LILA

Oh, Rosie.

ROSE

And I'm going to miss the lifestyle

having you as a client has afforded

me.

LILA

Shut up, you.

ROSE

I like you so much, with or without

hair.

(confidentially)

But don't spread that around. Bad

for business.

LILA

I'm really glad you two found each

other.

MIDGET

We're soul mates.

ROSE

Souls have nothing to do with it,

babe.

LILA

I'll be in touch.

ROSE

No you won't. But it's okay. You

have stuff you gotta do.

LILA

(choked)

Gotta go.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LILA

Stay.

CUT TO:

LILA

Out.

LILA

Bad.

LILA

Get up.

LILA

Take off your clothes.

LILA

We're going back to nature, you and

I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm

going to make you free again if I

have to kill you doing it.

PUFF

But I like being human now.

LILA

You what?

PUFF

I want to be the way I was before.

LILA

(sweet)

Good. I'll show you how, apey.

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF

Nice night.

LILA

Talking is to be kept to a minimum.

Eventually, when we are ready, there

will be none. Language was invented

so that people could lie to each

other and to themselves. There is no

other reason.

PUFF

(confused)

I agree?

LILA

You lose. Any answer is the wrong

answer.

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

(whisper)

You'll thank me eventually, Puff.

Well, you won't thank me, because we

won't be speaking, but you'll sort

of thank me with a special look, the

look a dog gives you to let you know

he loves you.

PUFF

What an enchanting picture you paint

of our future together.

CUT TO:

PUFF

And so commenced my reeducation,

gentlemen. Lila taught me so much.

She was a stern but fair teacher.

And over time, I began to remember

the carefree joy of living in a pure

state of being. But something else

happened as well, something perhaps

distinctly human... I began to fall

in love with Lila.

DISSOLVE TO:

PUFF

Boy, you look so good from this ang...

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.

NATHAN

I don't know. Something's missing.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

(uninterested)

So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell

going?

MOTHER

How did you know we...

MOTHER

Tell him, Harold.

FATHER

It's going famously, son, famously!

NATHAN

(despondent)

I'm glad.

MOTHER

Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong.

GABRIELLE

Yes, please, somebody ask him what

is wrong.

NATHAN

I don't know.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

I want our boy back.

GABRIELLE

(sadly)

Oui.

NATHAN

That bitch. I worked so hard. We

worked so hard, you and I. He would've

made us famous.

GABRIELLE

We still have you and I.

NATHAN

I know. And that's great. But it

would be great in a better way, not

a better way but a different way, if

I could find him and bring him back.

GABRIELLE

Where do we look for little lost

Puff?

NATHAN

I have some thoughts. I think that

hairy bitch is somewhere trying to

turn him back into an ape.

GABRIELLE

That is horrible. Apes are dirty.

No?

NATHAN

You better believe they're dirty!

And smelly! And messy! And they don't

know their forks from their assholes!

NATHAN

I'm going alone. This could be

dangerous.

GABRIELLE

(pulling covers up

and turning away

from him onto her

side)

Okay, my sweet. Good night.

NATHAN

A little resistance would be nice,

damn it.

GABRIELLE

(without opening her

eyes)

Please let me go with you.

NATHAN

No.

GABRIELLE

Okay.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

NATHAN

(yelling)

Aha!

CUT TO:

NATHAN

No luck yet, my sweet.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

It was paradise.

(beat, sadly)

At least for a tiny little while.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Aha! Finally. I've covered almost

the entire seaboard and parts of

eastern Ohio.

LILA

Ugnh.

PUFF

Ugnh.

NATHAN

Oh please, is that as articulate as

you can be after all the time I spent

teaching you? We've discussed

Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not

that you ever had anything very

original or challenging to say on

the subject.

PUFF

Unn.

NATHAN

Down from the tree. Both of you.

Keep your hands where I can see them.

Don't want you pulling any weapons

out of your fur.

NATHAN

Look at you two. You both disgust

me.

LILA

Oook. Oook.

NATHAN

Shut up!

(to Puff)

I gave you... life. I created you in

my image, Puff. I took you from this

primordial ooze and brought you into

the world of culture and art and

manners. And this is how you repay

me? By heading back to the ooze first

chance you get? I should leave you

here with Lila the ape woman. It

would serve you right, you ungrateful

piece of crap. But I'm not going to.

You're too valuable to me. Totally

selfish of me. You serve my purpose.

But if you had any smarts you would

realize that I serve your purpose as

well. Life is so much more delightful

when lived in a silk suit.

LILA

Ooka.

NATHAN

Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I

don't have any interest in you

anymore.

(to Puff)

C'mon, monkey boy.

NATHAN

Now!

NATHAN

Puff, put the gun down.

PUFF

Ounpoo. Ungh.

NATHAN

Let's be reasonable human beings

here. We're all reasonable human

beings, aren't we?

PUFF

(jumping up and down

like a chimp)

Unka unka unka unka unka.

NATHAN

Look, why don't you and Lila stay

here and have your natural life.

I'll just go on my way. You'll never

see me again.

PUFF

(to Lila, guiltily)

I have to talk. Is that okay?

PUFF

(to Nathan)

You did create me in your image,

Nathan. Before you I was a simple,

happy, complete being, in harmony

with the world around me. After you

I became duplicitous, cynical, angry,

anal, totally out of touch with my

surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I

became you. Lila has reintroduced me

to myself. And, incidentally, what

I'm about to do, kill you, is

something that would never have

occurred to me to do as a creature

of the Earth. Before when I killed,

it was for food or in self-defense.

Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge

is an abstract concept, Nathan. And

I learned abstract thinking from

you.

NATHAN

No.

LILA

Puff, don't.

CUT TO:

LILA

Then I shot Nathan.

CUT TO:

PUFF

Then Lila shot Nathan.

CUT TO:

NATHAN

Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's

all I know. That's the end of my

story. Do I get to go to heaven now?

(beat)

Or is it... hell?

(beat)

Or... what?

(beat)

I just stay here, is it? I just stay

here and tell it again? And after

that? Again? And after...

(sighs)

Yes. Yes, of course.

(sighs, clears his

throat)

NATHAN

(beginning again)

I don't even know what sorry means

anymore. It's odd. When I was alive

I knew -- maybe it was all I knew...

DISSOLVE TO:

LILA

He's dead.

PUFF

(calmly)

We bury the body. We disappear into

the woods. Nobody knows.

LILA

(beat, then quietly)

No. This is the end of the road.

There's a dead human being here. For

all of his faults, he was a human

being, and certainly a victim of his

culture as much as anybody.

PUFF

Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear.

We'll never talk about it again.

We'll never talk again period. I

love you.

LILA

Puff, what happened to you is as

much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe

more so, because I knew it was wrong

and I went along with it anyway. I'm

taking responsibility for the murder.

I want you to go back to your old

life.

PUFF

I won't let you do that. I shot the

bastard. And I'm glad.

LILA

No. Go back to the woods. This is a

sacrifice I need to make. In my world

we have something called penance.

It's another abstraction, but I had

the concept drummed into my head

during my years in the convent. It

doesn't exist for you, and it

shouldn't. See, I could never be

free again anyway, so I might as

well be in jail.

PUFF

(beat)

Then I'll live for both of us, Lila.

I'll be the most free, truest animal

in the whole forest. For both of us.

LILA

(tearing up)

That's what I'm counting on.

PUFF

(an idea)

But first I'll live among them, just

long enough to testify before congress

about the waywardness of humankind.

LILA

(shrugs)

Okay. If you think it will help.

CUT TO:

PUFF

And so, gentlemen, that is my story.

I agreed to testify before this

committee because I hoped to convey

to the American public that there is

indeed a paradise lost. Human beings

have become so enamored of their

technologies and their intellectual

prowess and their fancy gourmet foods,

that they've forgotten to look to

the Earth as a teacher. This is

hubris, my friends. And my story of

destruction and betrayal is proof of

that. I will keep my promise to Lila.

I will shed this suit and go back

into the wilderness. I will live out

my days naked and free.

CONGRESSMAN

Thank you, sir. Your story has touched

us all deeply. We will pass some

legislation addressing this problem.

PUFF

Thank you. That is all I ask.

(to camera)

Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me

in my untamed heart.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

OLDER WOMAN

Wait!

PUFF

(turning)

Yes?

OLDER WOMAN

I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking

for you for thirty years. Then there

you were, such a beautiful, beautiful

grown man.

PUFF

Mother?

OLDER WOMAN

Yes... Derek.

PUFF

(formally)

It's a pleasure to meet you, mother.

But I'm an ape like dad was...

(checks watch)

And I have to go back into the woods

now... forever.

OLDER WOMAN

(resigned)

Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew

that was going to be what you would

say. It's good to see you again

though.

PUFF

Yes.

OLDER WOMAN

I'm in the book, if you ever want to

drop me a line or something.

PUFF

I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And

apes don't drop lines.

CUT TO:

GABRIELLE

Hello, my little boy.

PUFF

Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes?

I'm freezing my ass off.

GABRIELLE

Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like

you asked.

PUFF

Great.

(putting on suit)

God, I've wanted you forever.

GABRIELLE

Say my name.

PUFF

Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE

(eyes glistening)

You remind me so much of Nathan.

PUFF

Like father, like son.

GABRIELLE

(stroking his face)

You remind me so much of Nathan plus

so much of my little mongrel doggie.

PUFF

Woof.

PUFF

Arf.

PUFF

As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not

sorry she killed him, if it means I

can have you. Is that a terrible

thing to say, my sweet?

GABRIELLE

(putting her finger

to his lips)

Hush. No, it is never terrible to be

in love. Nathan's memory lives on in

our sacred union.

(beat)

I'm not sorry she killed him either.

Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite

and sophisticated and charming. You

are all that, too. But you have

something more. You have a bit of

the animal in you.

PUFF

Let's go eat, I'm starved.

GABRIELLE

French?

PUFF

Oui.

CUT TO:

THE END
