Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg

OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC,

which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the

expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence.

Instead we get:

INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING

Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad

attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,

cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out

his cell and dials.

SETH

Yo.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

2                                                                   2

Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who

clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing

off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.

EVAN

What's up?

SETH

I was doing research last night, for next

year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang

Bus.

EVAN

Which one's Bang Bus?

SETH

The one where they bang the chicks on the

bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total

access, live Web Cam feed. The works.

It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging

them myself.

EVAN

That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking

it. And plus, your parents are gonna look

at the bill.

SETH

It shows up under a different name.

(beat)

I hope. Bang Bus.

SETH (CONT'D)

That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should

just pick the one with the least dirty

sounding name.

EVAN

Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.

Seth pulls up in front of a house.

SETH

I could tell my parents I'm doing a

project on Rome and I have to research

orgies.

EXT. EVAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

3                                                                         3

Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking

towards Seth's car.

EVAN

(still into phone)

Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class

on blow jobs.

They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to

pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.

EVAN'S MOM

Thanks for taking him, Seth.

Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.

SETH

Don't touch that!

EVAN'S MOM

You two are so funny. I can't imagine

what you'll do without each other next

year. Evan told me you didn't get into

State.

SETH

Yeah, you know. I got some other places.

Good places. I think we'll be fine.

EVAN'S MOM

Are you going to miss each other?

EVAN

Miss each other? No!

(CONTINUED)

SETH

That's disgusting.

MOM

Bye, boys.

Seth and Evan drive off.

SETH

I am truly, truly jealous that you got to

suck on those tits when you were a baby.

EVAN

Fuck you, man.

EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER

4                                                                         4

They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that

reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth

turns into the STAFF parking lot.

INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER

5                                                                         5

Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.

EVAN

You're being an idiot, man. You really

shouldn't park there.

SETH

Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.

They should be suckin' my balls. It's the

least they can do for stealing three

years of my life.

They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they

enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into

Seth.

EVAN

What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?

SETH

Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I

knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in

capture the flag last week.

EVAN

Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash

in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate

that guy.

They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

(CONTINUED)

5   CONTINUED:                                                        5

EVAN (CONT'D)

Look at those nipples.

SETH

They're like baby toes.

EVAN

It's not fair. I have to hide every

erection I get.

SETH

Sometimes I get boners so big I can't

hide them. And then I get nervous and my

heart starts pounding, and it all just,

like, feeds my boner. It just becomes

this...thing...that's attached to me. And

it won't go away.

EVAN

Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out

by our boners and they actually wanted to

see `em, like this shit.

SETH

You know it's been, like, a year and a

half since I've seen an actual human

female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it

last month, and it was sick.

EVAN

Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I

guess so. She was insanely hot, though.

SETH

Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.

EVAN

How can that possibly suck? I'd be

fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl

that hot. You got, like, two dozen

handjobs!

SETH

And three quarters of a blowjob, But that

was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-

gettin' career, and it happened way, way,

way too early.

EVAN

You're like Orson Welles.

(CONTINUED)

5.

5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  5

SETH

Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd

probably at least be having steady sex

with a mediocre-looking girl at this

point. I honestly now see why Orson

Welles ate his fat ass to death.

EVAN

You'll have sex in college. Everyone

does. And if not, you'll have the Bang

Bus.

SETH

But the key is to be good at sex by the

time you're in college. You don't want

girls to think you suck dick at fucking.

EVAN

I still think you've got a chance with

Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,

and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause

she still flirts with you.

SETH

Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she

dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber

and what's-his-face. All of those were

cool guys. She's been hot way longer than

you think. Why would she end her high

school career with me?

EVAN

Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.

SETH

Yeah, and he was a complete fucking

loser. You're a step up from that. Which

is why you should stop being a pussy and

do her! You could nailthe shit out of

her for, like, two months before you

leave. That bitch looks like a good

fucker.

EVAN

Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her

like that, man!

Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.

SETH

What, you can talk about that bitch all

day every single day, but I can't say one

thing about her?

(CONTINUED)

6.

5   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  5

EVAN

I don't constantly insult her.

SETH

I didn't insult her! I said she looks

like a good fucker! She looks like she

can take a dick. That's a good thing.

Some women pride themselves on their dick-

taking abilities.

EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the

rough-looking smokers, calls out.

TERRY

Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big

grad party?

Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.

SETH

No.

TERRY

Yeah.

Terry spits on Seth's shirt.

TERRY (CONT'D)

And you're not coming. Tell your fucking

faggot friend he can't come either.

Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as

though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when

Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry

and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head

back to school.

EVAN

Wow. You really bitched out on that one.

SETH

I bitched out? You bitched out! You were

across the street before I even realized

what was going on.

(beat)

That guy's such a douche bag.

EXT. CLARK SECONDARY OVAL RUNNING TRACK - DAY

BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS

There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the

school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys

start running.

We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the

same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The

group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the

frame. He stops.

CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:

Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.

SETH

(panting)

This...is...bullshit.

A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by.

KID

(as he passes Seth)

Poo-say.

INT. CLARK SECONDARY CLASSROOM - DAY

8                                                                       8

Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.

She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing

volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from

her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He

immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.

The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as

they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a

pen.

HELEN

Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.

EVAN

Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep

it. Then you'll just have it, and you

won't have to borrow another pen.

HELEN

Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did

you hear about Terry's grad party? It's

going to be so insane.

EVAN

Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I

gotta, I got my...

EVAN (CONT'D)

there's so much other fun shit that is

going to be going on that night...so, you

know...

HELEN

Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at

any parties or anything.

EVAN

Because of all the other fun shit I'm off

doing.

HELEN

(playful)

Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's

party on Saturday?

EVAN

Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go,

because, well, I did other stuff.

Saturday...

(nervous, he desperately

thinks)

Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!

(The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage

of quick flashbacks.)

EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)

First my parents went out to a double

feature, so a bunch of people came

over...

INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Seth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web

site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one

of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old.

EVAN

...and we had a couple drinks in my

basement...

An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer

cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer.

EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)

...and Seth's parents were having this

cocktail party, and we went over there

to, like, mingle...

Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys

are drunk as hell.

EVAN

...and there were actually some really

interesting and, like, entertaining

people there...

The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce

onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several

adults look at them like they are morons.

EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.)

...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live

music.

INT. SETH'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

11                                                                  11

In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives

Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh.

EVAN

...then we went to a club downtown...

EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

12                                                                  12

The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.

EVAN

...and then we pretty much called it a

night and went home...

INT. TBD HOUSE - NIGHT

13                                                                  13

Evan pukes all over Seth. Evan and Fogell laugh hysterically

as Seth yells at them.

INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - DAY

14                                                                  14

We return to Evan talking to Helen in the halls.

EVAN

...you would've loved it.

HELEN

That sounds so fun. I would love to go do

something like that.

(CONTINUED)

14   CONTINUED:                                                        14

EVAN

Yeah...well, you know, me and Seth are

always cooking up...uh...fun

little...events.

Helen is disappointed in his response.

HELEN

So, are you guys going to the same school

next year?

EVAN

Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got

into different ones.

HELEN

What are you going to do without him?

EVAN

Same shit I've always been doing. It'll

be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.

INT. FOODS AND NUTRITION ROOM - NEXT PERIOD

Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard

reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.

Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.

SETH

Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I

thought I'd be cooking with a partner.

It's not fair. She's never here. I don't

get twice the marks for doing all the

work.

MRS. GREIR

I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

SETH

Look at Evan.

Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They

both laugh hard.

SETH (CONT'D)

While I'm over in my unit, isolated and

alone, eating my terrible-tasting food

because I can't even properly mix

ingredients by myself, I gotta look over

at that.

(CONTINUED)

The Japanese boy ties Evan's apron. Evan then turns around

and ties the boy's apron. They both look happy.

SETH (CONT'D)

I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like

a single mother.

MRS. GREIR

Well, save it for next week. Today Jules'

partner isn't here either. Pair up with

her. Station four.

SETH

Jules?

The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four,

nervous as hell.

ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking.       She

stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.

Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,

unsure of what to say.

JULES

Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?

SETH

That's kind of a personal question.

JULES

What?

SETH

(nervous)

Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.

JULES

Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd

be forced to work with me. There's my

attempt at humour.

SETH

Well, I would call that a success.

(reading recipe sheet)

Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that

some kind of new cheese or something?

JULES

All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.

SETH

Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.

15   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 15

JULES

Thank you! Yes! My older brother always

eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is

actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's

moldy, then they tell you to eat it

anyway.

SETH

Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my

dick.

INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM - LATER

Jules watches as Seth awkwardly removes the tiramisu from the

oven and places it on the table.

JULES

What are you doing tonight?

SETH

I don't know, probably nothing. Why?

JULES

My parents are out of town and I'm

thinking of having a party. I don't know

how big it'll be, but you should come

anyways.

SETH

Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love

parties.

JULES

Really? I don't usually see you at them.

SETH

Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate

thing. Right now I love them, though.

Uh...how do I do this?

JULES

I'll write down my address and number.

ANGLE ON: Evan.

Evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray. Behind him, at

the table, is the small Japanese boy eating the tiramisu.

EVAN

That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?

Seth walks up to Evan.

SETH

(whispering)

Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party.

ANGLE ON: Fogell entering the room

SETH (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Don't tell Fogell about the party.

FOGELL

Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the

way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing

these tight white pants and a black g-

string and you could see it right through

the pants.

We see Fogell, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly

hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky;

you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants.

She turns and notices Fogell. He gives an awkward look.

FOGELL

It's nine thirty.

NICOLA

Back to Fogell, Seth and Evan.

FOGELL

I told her what time it was. It was

awesome. She's got the nicest ass.

SETH

Like you'd know what to do with it.

FOGELL

Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee-

slappers when me and Evan are at State.

SETH

(pissed)

Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college

where the girls are half as smart, and

thus twice as likely to blow me.

FOGELL

What are you guys doing tonight?

SETH

Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to

fingerbang yourself.

EVAN

(to Fogell)

What you doing?

FOGELL

Well, Seth always said I was too much of

a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been

arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same

place Mike Snider went to pick up my

brand new false identification card.

SETH

Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan,

didn't you just say that you heard about

a party?

FOGELL

(to Evan)

Why didn't you tell me?

SETH

Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he

told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.

FOGELL

Sounds cool. Cool.

MRS. GREIR (O.S.)

If you're not in this class, leave this

class!

EVAN

Well done, man. We'll see you after

class.

Fogell leaves.

SETH

Did you tell that nimrod you're not going

to room with him?

EVAN

Uh...no, not yet.

SETH

You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang

repellent.

SETH

We're getting a fake ID.

JULES

Well, you two have four more years to

cuddle, so let's get to work.

EVAN

Actually, we're going to different

schools.

JULES

Really? You're cutting the cord? What's

going to happen?

SETH

Nothing! Jesus.

EVAN

Yeah? What do people think is gonna

happen? That's what I don't get.

SETH

We're not, like, dependent on each other.

EVAN

We met when we were 8, we were fine

before then. It's not like we do

everything together.

Seth and Evan are eating together.

EVAN

So it looks like we get a little

graduation party after all.

SETH

I would do terrible things to get with

Jules tonight. Terrible things.

EVAN

No shit. I'd give my left foot to start

dating Helen. She's killin' me.

SETH

Ah, Helen's a bitch.

Evan slams his fist on the table.

EVAN

I'm fuckin' sick of this shit, man!

Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there

even an actual reason? Because seriously,

I'm beginning you think you like her.

SETH

Hell no! I hate her.

EVAN

Why?

SETH

I was never going to tell you this story,

because I knew that if you heard it you

would never want to get with Helen, but

over the last few weeks I've been having

a hard time thinking of a reason not to.

So, here it is. Helen and I went to

elementary school together, right?

(beat)

Well, in the third grade, I

had...like...an odd problem. For some

reason, I don't know why, I used to have

this thing...where I would...like,

kinda...sit around all day and draw

pictures of dicks.

EVAN

What?

pictures of dicks in various places. A PARK, AT HOME, IN A

SANDBOX, and finally, in a SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

SETH (V.O.)

I'd just sit there for hours on end

drawing dicks. I don't know what it was.

I couldn't touch the pen to paper without

it drawing a penis.

EVAN (V.O.)

That's fucked.

SETH (V.O.)

No shit that's fucked up. Here I am this

little kid who can't stop drawing dicks

to save his life.

Young Seth is still sitting at his desk drawing penises.

SETH (V.O.)

I was very secretive about this dick

thing I had going, after all, even I

thought I was a loon, lord knows what

other people would have thought. So I

would take all my dick drawings and stick

them in this Muppet lunch-box I had.

We see Young Seth sticking a picture of a penis in a lunch-

box filled with pieces of paper.

Young Seth is drawing, however it is a different day.

SETH (V.O.)

So one day I was finishing up a picture

of a real big and veiny bastard, when all

of a sudden...

Young Seth drops the picture of the dick off his desk. It

floats down and hits the feet of a cute little girl, YOUNG

HELEN.

A FLASHBACK of Young Seth sitting in the principle's office.

The Muppet lunch-box is open and the penis drawings are

completely covering his desk.

SETH (V.O.)

It turns out the principle was some crazy

possessed by some dick devil or

something.

The principal puts his hand on Seth's head and begins praying

for his soul.

SETH

So, he calls my parents and they make me

go to a psychologist who kept asking me

all these dick questions. My parents

wouldn't even let me eat dick-shaped

foods for, like, months! No carrots, no

Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how

many fucking foods are shaped like dick?

EVAN

Hey. Here I am.

JULES

So you're coming to my party, right? It's

fully on.

SETH

Yeah. Why? Should I not?

JULES

No, no, no. I really want you to come.

But...uh, you did say you were getting a

fake ID or something, is that right?

SETH

Very right. Right. I'm getting that.

SHIRLEY

Can you get us drinks?

SETH

Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe.

JULES

(half joking)

Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll

scratch yours.

SETH

Well, funny thing about my back. It's

located on my cock.

Shirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. Seth laughs too

hard.

SETH (CONT'D)

Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do

you guys want?

JULES

Well, this is actually, like, a big

favor, but, well, my parents gave me like

a hundred bucks to feed myself for the

week, but the house if full of food, so I

figure I should just spend all of it on

extra drinks for the party.

SETH

Wow. I would never even think of doing

something that nice.

Jules hands Seth a hundred dollars.

Well, this is really nice of you. I mean,

I really appreciate this.

Seth can't believe what he's hearing. He can barely contain

his smile.

SETH

Should I just get, like, a shitload of

different shit?

JULES

Whatever shit you think people would

like, I don't really know.

SHIRLEY

I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.

JULES

Okay. I'll see you tonight.

SETH

Yeah! I'll see you!

The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly

runs down the hall.

Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as

they play soccer.

GYM TEACHER

Evan, get into the game.

Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his

attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him.

SETH

(out of breath, worked up)

Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know

Jules? You know what she just did? She

came up to me and asked me if I would buy

her alcohol. Not just her, her whole

party. Do you know what that means? It

means that by some miracle, we were

paired up, we talked, and she actually

thought of me afterwards. Thought of me

enough to decide that I was the guy that

she was going to trust the fun-ness of

her party with. She wants me! She fucking

wants my dick!

SETH

She has an older brother! She could have

asked him, but she asked me! She looked

me straight in the face and asked me. She

wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand

that? Fucking! Today is the day that

fucking has become possible.

EVAN

Are you stupid? You're not going to be

able to sleep with her tonight.

SETH

She's going to be at the party, she's

gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least

a little, so I can get with her. Then, I

make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck

her all summer long! Then, by the time

college rolls around, I'm the fuckin'

fucking master, man!

EVAN

Make her your girlfriend? Of course!

That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion,

or mind-control helmet?

SETH

Once I've gotten with her, I write her

love letters, flowers, I'll do anything -

I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the

universe - what chick wouldn't go out

Evan shrugs back.

Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your

pants again?

That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!

He runs off.

SETH

Wanna hear the best part?

EVAN

(sarcastic)

Oh, I haven't?

SETH

Helen!

Evan looks upset, assuming that Seth is about to trash-talk

Helen, as usual.

SETH (CONT'D)

You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her

alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are

both drunk, get with her! This is the

last party we're ever going to go to as

high school people! I've fully ignored my

hatred for Helen in coming up with this,

which is a big ass deal. We need to stop

being pussy and for once just goes balls

out, man!

Evan seems to be swayed.

EVAN

I should get Helen alcohol?

SETH

Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you

know she'll be drunk.

Everyone is rushing to class. Evan hurries through the halls

and finds Helen at her locker.

EVAN

Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about

the party tonight?

HELEN

Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet.

You're not coming, are you?

EVAN

No, no, I am. That's why I came looking

for you. Me and some guys are going to

the liquor store after class, so I was

thinking I could buy you yours, if you

needed someone to.

HELEN

Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me

such a hassle, cause I was going to beg

my sister, but yeah, could you get me,

like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay

you back tonight.

EVAN

You will absolutely not. It's my treat.

HELEN

Wow. Thanks, Evan.

Evan swings a friendly little punch at Helen's shoulder, but

someone walks into him, causing him to nail her in directly

in the tit!

HELEN (CONT'D)

Hey! You punched my tit!

I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man,

look.

Fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID.

Evan grabs it.

EVAN

Okay Mr..."McLovin"? What kind of a

stupid name is that? What are you

trying to be, an Irish R&B singer?

FOGELL

Well, they let you pick any name you want

when you get there.

SETH

So you picked McLovin?

FOGELL

It was between that or Muhammad.

SETH

Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why

didn't you just pick a common name?

FOGELL

Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most

commonly used name on earth.

Muhammad?

you for even considering the name

Muhammad on a fake ID!

SETH

Look at this shit man, you don't even

have a first name. It just says "NAME:

MCLOVIN"

EVAN

One name?

FOGELL

I just thought McLovin sounded old, and

the chicks would dig it.

EVAN

Under what circumstances would you ever

have to show a chick your ID?

FOGELL

She could ask. Or, I could just show it

to her.

SETH

Holy shit! I don't believe this. This

says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you

just put 21?

FOGELL

I knew you would ask that. Look, every

day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor

store with fake ID's trying to act like

Joe Casual. Each and every one of these

kids just so happens to be 21 years old.

Just how many 21 year-olds do you think

there are?

SETH

Fool!

EVAN

Calm down! It's not terrible! This might

work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll

either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid

with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin,

the twenty five year-old organ donor".

What's it gonna be?

You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and

this is never going to work. We need a

new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to

Canada or something?

FOGELL

I still think it's going to work.

They walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops.

I told you, man! What did I say? I told

you that was a dumb idea.

FOGELL

Why would you park in the staff-

SETH

Shut up, Fogell.

FOGELL

`Cause you're not staff.

I am aware of that, Fagell.

EVAN

Come on! Just wear what you wore to

I told you I can't do that. I can't let

Jules see me in the same shit I wore at

school. It's completely unbecoming.

Why don't you just go to your house and

get your own clothes? `Cause this is

stupid.

Alright, dude. Get ready to receive.

towards them. He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a

shirt and a vest.

SETH

What the hell is that?

FOGELL

A vest.

SETH

You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.

EVAN

What? It's just a vest.

FOGELL

Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in

vests?

SETH

(eyeing Shopwell's)

You know, they got a ton of liquor right

in there. If we get it now we can get to

the party faster with all of Jules' shit.

FOGELL

No way! I work there. They know I'm not

twenty-five.

SETH

Nobody said anything about you, dick-

mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's

out of the equation!

SETH (CONT'D)

And now I'm gonna have to take drastic

measures. I'm gonna steal the booze.

FOGELL

What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!

EVAN

(mocking)

Yeah, right!

SETH

That's right. And that way I give Jules

back her money, like you did with Helen.

That was good thinking, that's fucking

pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It

won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb

stole a keg from here and he's got, like,

really bad scoliosis!

EVAN

You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's

not going to steal it.

FOGELL

Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll

get the liquor later.

SETH

I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't

step back down. Maybe you "State" boys

don't understand that.

Seth walks to the store.

Seth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a

SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers.

SETH

(to himself)

Hope piggy can run.

He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the

long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD

WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers.

Seth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze

in the conveyor belt.

CASHIER

You certainly are. That'll be eighty

Seth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.

Seth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his

head. He eyeballs the old lady.

The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand

reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth.

SETH

Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse.

Would you like me to help you to your

car?

OLD LADY

That would be lovely, young man. Would

you like me to buy you alcohol?

SETH

That would be lovely!

as she drives away.

Enjoy your remaining years!

breath and starts walking.

He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks

down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads,

"GOLDSCHLAGER."

SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)

Don't do it kid.

We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth

doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.

SETH

I never had a choice.

He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it

with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at

Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY

in the head.

OLD LADY

(in agony)

AAAHHHHH!!!

Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce

bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken

end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out.

Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.

Evan and Fogell are talking.

FOGELL

Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the

TV from her basement and I've got, like,

three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so

like, we can have that in the room-

Evan sees Seth coming out of Shopwell's.

EVAN

Shh. Seth's coming.

FOGELL

You still didn't tell him we're rooming-

EVAN

No. Shut up.

FOGELL

So, where's all the stolen liquor?

SETH

Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security

was tight as shit. I was gonna do it

though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to

the liquor store and try your stupid ID.

Seth heads towards the bus stop.

FOGELL

Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my

locker!

The bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get

out.

EVAN

Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?

SETH

Here's the list.

FOGELL

A list? Why?

SETH

We're getting girls their booze so

they'll get with us. I put a lot of

thought into that list. It's the perfect

party bar, so don't mess it up and get

Sambuca again.

Fogell reads the list. A worried look sweeps across his face.

FOGELL

Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-

EVAN

Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not

forget it.

FOGELL

Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade.

FOGELL

This is too much. I can't get away with

this much!

EVAN

What's the difference?

Seth hands Fogell the money.

FOGELL

I don't know, man. I'm getting, like,

really nervous.

Fogell starts breathing very hard and making an ODD NOISE

while doing so.

EVAN

Are you okay?

SETH

What the hell are you doing?

FOGELL

I don't know if I want to do this.

SETH

What are you talking about? You just

promised you would. What is this shit?

FOGELL

What if they turn me down?

SETH

Then we're in the same place that we're

in right now!

FOGELL

It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the

store sees them kicking me out. What if

they make me put all the liquor back on

the shelf? I can't do that!

SETH

This whole thing is bigger than you,

asshead! Just go in there and buy the

damn alcohol!

FOGELL

What if I don't feel like it anymore?

SETH

Then I will kill you! How's that? If you

don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you!

FOGELL

Killing me won't get you any alcohol,

jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!

SETH

Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly

face, put it over mine, and buy it my

fucking self.

FOGELL

You don't have the technology or the

steady hands to pull off a procedure like

that!

Seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell. Evan

stands between them and breaks it up.

EVAN

Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a

baby and go buy the alcohol! You said

you'd do it, so do it. It's why you

bought the ID, so just go do it.

FOGELL

(beat)

I'll try.

Fogell walks into the store.

At first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused,

dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and

takes a few deep breaths.

CLERK

Hi there.

Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps

walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell

passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly

recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the

opposite direction.

SON

Fogell?

(weird voice, covering his

face)

No.

SON

Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing

here?

FOGELL

(weird voice)

Uh...nothing. Not Fogell...

(whisper)

Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me.

MOSCOVITCH

(knowingly)

Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck.

He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at

the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly

opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack

and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the

other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and

spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop

the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is

impossible.

FOGELL

Fuck.

A CLERK approaches Fogell.

CLERK

Is there a problem, sir?

FOGELL

Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.

CLERK

(pointing to the beer on the

floor)

Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

FOGELL

No.

I think it happened before.

Fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all

over his legs, holding a can of beer.

Fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line

to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is

currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.

CASHIER

Um, yes, may I please see some ID?

OLD-LOOKING GUY

No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in

years.

CASHIER

Anyone who looks under thirty-five.

The guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches.

Seth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows.

SETH

It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never

had a problem. It's fine. Right?

EVAN

Calm down.

(beat)

Did you remember a condom?

SETH

You brought a condom?

EVAN

Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well.

I brought one of those little things of

spermicidal lube too.

He takes them out of his pocket.

SETH

You asshole! You laughed in my face when

I said we'd be having sex tonight.

EVAN

It doesn't mean you shouldn't be

prepared. You didn't even bring one?

SETH

No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan!

I can't believe you did that without even

consulting me about it!

EVAN

I don't really even understand what your

plan is.

SETH

I'm gonna go down on her for, like,

hours. She'll love that. She'll want to

go out with that.

EVAN

Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in

bringing just one little condom.

SETH

And one little bottle of spermicidal

lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know

you brought that! These girls are 18, not

dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.

EVAN

Fine. I won't bring the lube.

Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him

kind of funny.

FOGELL

Hello...

Mindy.

She rings up a six pack of Budweiser.

FOGELL (CONT'D)

Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it

stuff up and looks at him.

Seth and Evan are still leaning against the window.

EVAN

Do you think I could get Helen to do some

kind of long distance thing?

Seth looks as if he sees something in the distance. He stands

upright.

SETH

Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins!

EVAN

I haven't seen her since she switched

schools.

SETH

She had the biggest tits in the universe.

Down the block there is a girl walking a dog.

EVAN

I heard she had breast-reduction surgery.

Her tits must be crazy perfect now.

I gotta see these bastards. Let's check

A huge smile forms on Fogell's face as he pulls out a wad of

money and hands it to the cashier. She starts to gather his

change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Fogell

right in the side of the head!!! Fogell falls to the ground.

The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a

handful of money and runs!

The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Fogell is on

Seth and Evan walk down the street towards the liquor store.

EVAN

That was a waste.

SETH

But she fully looked way better before. I

thought when they reduced them, they just

kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them

more supple.

EVAN

I can't even begin to imagine the

justification for making breasts smaller.

The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and

OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the

Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.

OFFICER SLATER

(to cashier)

So, did he punch anyone else?

CASHIER

(losing it completely)

I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I

have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand

that? A goddamn exam!

The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of

the store. The officers look at each other.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Apparently, she has an exam.

They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell.

OFFICER SLATER

(turn to Fogell)

So then, son, you're the one that got

punched?

Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then

back at the cops. He nods.

OFFICER MICHAELS

We'd like to ask you a couple questions.

The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil.

OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)

Okay, first things first. What's your

FOGELL

No, no I said, "McLovin".

OFFICER SLATER

Cool name. And your first name?

Fogell looks twice as scared.

FOGELL

Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an

That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost

a hundred dollars of Jules' money!

EVAN

We have to help him!

SETH

Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him

out of jail? I don't even know where jail

is! What we need is the alcohol, which is

impossible because we don't have any

fucking money!

Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot.

EVAN

Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think.

The cops are still talking to Fogell. He looks completely

flustered. He's lost his composure.

OFFICER SLATER

Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's

no need to get irrational.

In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we

jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is

I once arrested a man-lady who was

legally named "Pearl Necklace."

FOGELL

It's just... I changed my name. I was

going to be a singer. R&B.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Fine. That's not illegal.

OFFICER SLATER

And, how old are you McLovin?

Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again.

FOGELL

Old enough.

OFFICER SLATER

Old enough for what?

OFFICER MICHAELS

Can I see your ID?

FOGELL

Um...okay...

Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his

pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to

Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads

of sweat are running down Fogell's face.

In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's

car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.

OFFICER SLATER

You're an organ donor?

FOGELL

What?

OFFICER SLATER

I didn't want to be one but my wife

insisted.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Just like a woman. Even after you're

dead, they want to tear your heart out.

back the ID.

Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't

really have any information. I didn't

really see him. His fist hit here.

Fogell points at his giant black eye.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Are you in a hurry or something?

FOGELL

Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a

bus.

OFFICER SLATER

Where were you going?

FOGELL

Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.

OFFICER SLATER

We'll take you there, get your

information on the way. Sit tight.

Fogell is completely dumbfounded.

The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan.

DRIVER

I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't

see you at all. Are you okay? Are you

okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I

do? Are you okay?

The driver glances at the cop car.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

I mean, please don't report me, we can

figure this out, okay?

SETH

Why wouldn't I report you?

DRIVER

Because I'll do anything! Please!

Anything! What can I do?

You have any money?

EVAN

(quietly to Seth)

What are you doing?

DRIVER

(beat)

Fine. Just take it.

The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money.

Seth looks at it. It's seven dollars.

SETH

What is this? This isn't enough.

Seth stuffs the money in his pocket.

DRIVER

It's all I have.

SETH

Well, you just came from the liquor

store, give us your liquor.

DRIVER

I didn't get any. They're not letting

anyone in. They're arresting someone or

something.

SETH

Well, they'll be arresting somebody else

if you don't do something quick. Ow! My

shoulder! It's killing me.

Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is.

DRIVER

No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol?   I can

get you alcohol. I'm on my way to   this

party right now. There's gonna be   tons of

liquor. I will definitely get you   plenty.

SETH

You better.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here.

Seth goes over to Evan.

What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out,

we've got no other option. Let's go.

EVAN

I don't....I don't like this idea at all.

I'm just not feeling it. That guy's

fucking creepy. Just look at him.

They look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb

expression on his face.

DRIVER

(to Evan)

You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?

Cause you totally look like his brother.

SETH

He's an idiot. And he's our only hope.

Come on, don't break your promise to

Helen.

The Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the

back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell

right behind them carrying the bags of liquor.

OFFICER SLATER

(to Fogell)

Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying,

huh? And you're the one that got punched.

Did you hear her say she has an exam

tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right?

FOGELL

(afraid)

Heh. Good one.

OFFICER MICHEALS

Could we have taken her in? Just to scare

the shit out of her?

OFFICER SLATER

Hah. Probably could have found a way. But

a good general rule is only take people

in you want to ride with. And whiny

bitches don't make that cut.

The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car.

Seth and Evan sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the

DRIVER

One of you bros could have sat up here

There is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to

wriggle in discomfort.

Aaah!

Seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it.

There are six girls passing two beers in a circle while

dancing blissfully to crappy 80s music.

JULES

Seth! Where are you?

SETH

Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going

Awesome. I can't wait for you to get

JULES

Yeah. It looks like it could actually be

a great party. I think, like, tons of

people might show up. I hope they don't

trash my house.

SETH

Well, if they want to do that they're

going to have to get through me.

JULES

So I guess I don't have to worry then.

I'll see you soon.

Seth hangs up the phone, completely elated.

SETH

She called, man! That's insane! She's

practically begging for it. She said, "I

can't wait for you to get here."

DRIVER

That sounds like she fully wants it.

Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my

Seth and Evan are very weirded out.

The Driver's car pulls up in front of a house. The three get

out.

EVAN

Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're

Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best

They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been

looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer,

coolers, wine, vodka, everything.

SETH

Holy shit! Let's grab one of these

buckets and go.

MARK (O.S.)

What the fuck do you think you're doing?

DRIVER (O.S.)

What, man? It's nothing.

The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the

Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive

brute, MARK.

MARK

You calling more of your stupid friends

again? Ya prick.

DRIVER

Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.

MARK

Get the fuck out of my house.

DRIVER

Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a

dick.

Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and

drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the

door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan.

Mark steps on the Driver's hand.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Ahhhh! Fuck!

The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot. He

stands up.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!

Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward

and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts!

The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.

MARK

Francis, you and your idiot friends stay

The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide

in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.

EVAN

Dude, let's slip out the back.

SETH

Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just

hurry up and do this.

EVAN

You want to end up like that guy? Not me,

I need my nuts.

SETH

Then why haven't you ever made a move,

you pussy?

EVAN

Because I respect her! I'm not going to

SETH

These aren't girls, they're women! They

need our dicks as much as we need their

poons - and we all love liquor, so

where's the fucking beef?!

EVAN

We're leaving, okay? These guys could

kill us. You want to get killed for

liquor?

SETH

You're really gonna bail on me?!

EVAN

Jesus...

Evan walks out the door.

SETH

Okay, okay...if that's how you're going

FOGELL

Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer

those, uh, questions now if you want.

OFFICER SLATER

Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could

never catch one guy.

OFFICER MICHAELS

You see, McLovin, if it was two guys,

we'd have twice the chance of catching

one of them. But just one guy? I mean,

how are we supposed to find one guy in

this whole city?

OFFICER SLATER

Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people

there are in this city? I have trouble

finding people I know.

FOGELL

Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or

something? Don't you have a computer?

OFFICER SLATER

Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone

walks up to me on the street, and is

like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell

am I supposed to do that?

FOGELL

Who's Bob?

OFFICER SLATER

Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then

how am I supposed to know where he is?

So I pull up in front of her house and

she asks me to come inside for some

coffee. Of course, I say yes.

OFFICER SLATER

Oh shit.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I

start taking off my clothes, she fucking

flips, starts screaming at me, and I'm

like "Can't have coffee without cream."

Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then,

she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling

you McLovin, stay out of bars.

FOGELL

Hey, you don't need to tell me.

OFFICER MICHAELS

So, yeah, you gotta look in different

places. The gym, an art class, you know,

shit like that.

OFFICER SLATER

I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you

believe that? I shot her in the neck, and

we just hit it off. And my first wife --

who is a whore -- where do you think we

met? A bar.

FOGELL

I don't know. I find they're always good

for a little quick ass.

The cops laugh.

OFFICER SLATER

I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do

the whole mysterious guy thing, right?

OFFICER MICHAELS

Yeah McLovin, how's it going with the

ladies?

Fogell thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable.

FOGELL

Well, officers, it's not the going with

the ladies I care about, it's the coming.

The cops and Fogell burst out laughing.

OFFICER SLATER

Oh! McLovin in the house!

He sees that the cops clearly like him; his confidence level

increased, he takes a chance.

FOGELL

So...you guys got guns, huh?

The officers glance at each other as sinister smiles creep

across their faces.

OFFICER SLATER

Yeah. We got guns.

OFFICER MICHAELS

I haven't had one for long, but, man, let

me tell you - it's like having two dicks.

FOGELL

Can I...can I hold one? Your gun?

Michaels and Slater look to each other.

OFFICER MICHAELS

I mean, if we took the bullets out?

OFFICER SLATER

Yeah. Why not?

Slater pulls out his gun and takes out the clip.

OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)

Here.

Fogell takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in

his hands, a huge smile gleaming.

FOGELL

Wow. I've never held one. Are they hard

to shoot?

OFFICER SLATER

If you're Michaels they are. He can't

shoot worth dick.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Fuck you, old man. I could out-shoot you

with my sack tucked between my legs.

OFFICER SLATER

Only one way to settle this.

FOGELL

(incredibly excited)

You guys are going to shoot something,

right?

Seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it's not

doing much. He stops for a moment to take a breather as he

looks around the basement.

He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he

opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf

is completely filled with beer.

SETH

Jesus's tits!

He grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them

in his pockets, when he notices two large jugs of detergent

next to the washer. He thinks for a moment, then begins to

empty out the detergent jugs.

Helen is in a cab with BECCA, her best-friend, and two other

girls. They're a little done up and really giggly. Helen's

cell phone starts ringing. She hushes the other girls as she

answers her phone.

HELEN

Hello?

BECCA

Is it him?

HELEN

(whispering to the girls)

Shut up.

EVAN

Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are

you at the party?

HELEN

No, I'm in a cab. I'll be there soon. Are

HELEN

(whispering to the girls)

Shut up.

EVAN

What's going on there?

HELEN

Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure

you were still coming, you know, and that

you didn't get caught up at a cocktail

party or some club.

EVAN

Nope. I'm gonna be there.

HELEN

Well, I can't wait to see you.

Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he

turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES

wander into the room.

DUDE 1

They're going to kill that guy, man. That

bitch's boyfriend is so pissed.

DUDE 2

Yeah. And he's a beast.

They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of

them notices Evan standing in the corner.

DUDE 3

Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid

with the splotch on his crotch?

Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and

horrified.

EVAN

No. What splotch-

I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was

at that party with me.

DUDE 4

Who's he?

DUDE 2

He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the

crazy raps, the one I told you about!

They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the

door.

EVAN

Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy,

man. Sorry.

Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door.

DUDE 3

No. No, that's you, man. You are fully

Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed

up you can't remember.

EVAN

Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't

even listen to rap.

DUDE 3

It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've

been telling these guys about you. Just

give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.

They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid.

There! That's the guy!

Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver,

walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his

leg, too.

SETH

Hey! You got one, too! We're blood

brothers.

MARK

Shut it, you little shitter! What the

hell were you doing dancing with

Jacinda?

Horrified, Seth scrambles for excuses.

SETH

I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even

dance! Never even tried it!

MARK

(point at Seth's splotch)

Then where did that come from, asshole?

I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up

The coked-up dudes are watching Evan intensely. They are

completely loving his rapping, completely into it. Evan is

struggling.

EVAN

There is a crowd gathered around Seth and Mark. The Enormous

Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark.

SETH

I swear to God it wasn't me!

Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the

room. Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much

commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands.

MARK

And what the fuck is this?

SETH

It's nothing. It's detergent.

MARK

Yeah. And what are you doing with it?

SETH

I...uh, I got blood on my pants.

Mark sees the bottle of MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE in Seth's pocket

and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a

look of death.

SETH (CONT'D)

I brought them from home.

Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES Seth and throws the beer

bottle at his face!!! Seth holds up a detergent jug and

deflects the beer bottle.

It flies towards Evan, who ducks, and nails Dude 1 in the

head, glass exploding everywhere!!!

DUDE 1

AAAHHHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!

Dude 1 clutches his bloody head as the other Dudes charge at

Mark! A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting!

Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him

into Evan.

DUDE 3

Hold him!

EVAN

What?

DUDE 2

HOLD HIM!!!

Evan reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes

pound on him.

ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner

Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly

Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and

faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA.

JACINDA

You motherfucker!

She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth.

She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!

SETH

AHH!!!

JACINDA

You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated

me!!!

SETH

You're the one who used my leg as a

tampon!

She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around

the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles.

Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan

backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party.

The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is

sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is

carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.

OFFICER SLATER

You've been saying some bold words, my

friend. Better not mess up.

FOGELL

You can do it, officer.

BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole

right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my

nuts. Long, but gentle.

FOGELL

Yeah! And eat his ass!

They all laugh hysterically.

FOGELL (CONT'D)

Can I shoot one?

The cops look at each other and shrug.

OFFICER SLATER

Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.

Slater hands Fogell the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be

heard in the distance getting closer.

Michaels kicks it into drive and they peel out. Fogell shoves

the unconscious Homeless Guy over.

Hah, hah! Eat it. So, dudes, what do we

Suddenly, the car radio goes off.

No I didn't!

SETH

Of course you did! We were supposed to do

something and you left instead of doing

it! That's the definition of bailing!

EVAN

If you said we should burn our dicks off

and I didn't, that's not bailing!

SETH

It is bailing, if you promised to burn

your dick off!

EVAN

What?!

SETH

The bottom line is   you're a bailer. You

just bailed on me,   you bailed on me this

morning when Terry   spat on me, and you're

bailing on me next   year!

EVAN

Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes

out!

SETH

We were supposed to go to college

together! Since elementary school! What

ever happened to that!

EVAN

What happened to that, is that you're too

stupid to get into the schools I did!

SETH

I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!

EVAN

You've wasted all my time, you selfish

bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and

making friends, I threw away the last

three years talking bullshit with you!

And now, because of you, I'm going to

Michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with

his fist.

How do they expect us to work these

work my iMac while I'm sitting at my

desk.

FOGELL

So, like, what does that computer do?

OFFICER SLATER

Pretty much anything, if you're smart

enough to figure it out. Like, who do you

really hate? Gimme a name.

FOGELL

Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham.

Susette Graham.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Can I do it?

Slater nods. Michaels bring her file up, then punches a few

What? Oh man...

It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.

I guess.

FOGELL (CONT'D)

What the hell?

OFFICER SLATER

McLovin? What the fuck?

FOGELL

Officer Slater?

OFFICER SLATER

You ran away from us!

(turns to the door)

Michaels! Get up here!

FOGELL

No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was

all disoriented and I just wandered off,

confused. Seriously!

OFFICER MICHAELS

Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old

was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard,

that's statutory rape, McLovin.

OFFICER SLATER

McLovin!

OFFICER MICHAELS

He was violating a sixteen year-old girl!

FOGELL

What? No! No!

FOGELL (CONT'D)

I didn't break the law! I'm not really

even-

OFFICER MICHAELS

Sit your ass down and keep it down.

OFFICER SLATER

You're going to jail, fucko.

OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)

(to Fogell)

They don't take kindly to your type in

jail, McLovin.

Stupid pigs.

That does feel better.

So...am I going to jail?

OFFICER SLATER

(laughing his ass off)

Yeah!! You're going to fuckin' Azkaban!!!

FOGELL

What?

OFFICER MICHAELS

You are the funniest fuckin' kid I have

ever met!

OFFICER SLATER

We've been fuckin' with you! Jesus! I

FOGELL

I don't understand!

OFFICER SLATER

We know you're not twenty five! What are

Sixteen?

FOGELL

Seventeen.

OFFICER SLATER

Alright, boys. What I'm about to show you

is pretty much the greatest move in donut-

spinning history. Behold: the reverse

figure-eight.

FOGELL

So, like, what's your official position?

OFFICER MICHAELS

If you were in, you were in. You are no

longer a virgin, end of story. Screw

cumming.

OFFICER SLATER

Alright. I think that's all the fun we're

gettin' out of this one.

OFFICER SLATER

...and by signing this you are officially

saying that as we stopped you from being

mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser

and did God knows what with it.

FOGELL

Of course. That mugger had nothing but

murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.

OFFICER MICHAELS

Can we do this already?

OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)

Can we shoot at it?

OFFICER SLATER

I don't know, can you?

OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)

I'm throwin' down the gauntlet. 50 bucks.

Whoever hits the gas tank.

OFFICER MICHAELS

You are so fucking on.

FOGELL

Can I get a shot?

And then you saved me, man! I fucking

love you!

SETH

I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not

embarrassed, I just love you!

EVAN

Why don't we say that more? It feels

good! I love you more than my brother,

man. Like, when you went away for Easter

last year, I, like, missed you. You know?

SETH

I missed you, too. Come here, man.

SETH (CONT'D)

We'll always be friends. `Cause we love

each other.

SETH (CONT'D)

Like, three weeks ago I was in you room

and, like, you were taking a dump and...I

saw your residence placement thingy. I

totally saw you're living with Fogell.

So, like-

EVAN

I'm sorry, man.

SETH

Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was

being a bitch.

EVAN

I need you to know that it's not like I

even want to live with Fogell; it's just

that I'm really afraid of living with

strangers.

You know...I was pissed off I didn't get

with Jules, but, like...we really got

through a lot of our shit, you know?

EVAN

Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we

kind of came together, again.

EVAN (CONT'D)

Good night, Seth. I love you.

SETH

Night, Evan. Love you, man.

EVAN

Oh...uh...hey. Morning.

SETH

Uh...morning.

EVAN

You sleep good?

SETH

Yeah. This is a really good pillow.

EVAN

Um...

SETH

Maybe I should get going.

EVAN

You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing

anything.

Oh...do you want to hang out? I

was...gonna go to the mall, actually.

EVAN

Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a

comforter. For college.

SETH

Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like

that.

149                                                                    149

EVAN

Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your

pants look good.

SETH

Well, I need someone's opinion.

EVAN

Fine. They're way too small.

SETH

Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's

pants last night I realized that if I buy

pants that are too small it'll encourage

me to lose weight. And in tight pants

chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.

EVAN

Yeah, the male camel toe look is really

big this year.

SETH

These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck

out of here.

Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I

actually did that.

JULES

I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a

new one.

HELEN

I have to. It's puke.

EVAN

Holy shit!

SETH

Is that them?

EVAN

Should we hide?

SETH

Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look

EVAN

How are you feeling?

HELEN

Not bad, but not great, how about you?

SETH

That looks terrible. No! I mean, it

doesn't look terrible, it looks-

JULES

Don't worry about it, Seth. It was an

accident.

EVAN

(to Helen)

Did you have fun last night?

JULES

(to Seth)

Do you remember much?

HELEN

(to Evan)

I really don't remember much.

SETH

(to Jules)

Not really. I remember looking up, and

you screaming at me. That's about it.

HELEN

(to Evan)

I didn't puke on you, did I?

EVAN

No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.

Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that.

Thanks for being such a gentleman.

SETH

You look good with a black eye.

JULES

Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I

have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of

cover-up for the grad photo.

SETH

(mortified)

Oh man...

HELEN

Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to

buy Jules a new comforter.

EVAN

Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for

college.

JULES

(flirtatiously, joking)

So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and

buy me my cover-up, or what?

SETH

Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such

bad acne last year, I became an expert on

the stuff.

EVAN

You could get your college pants there.

SETH

Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan

drove me here, how do we-

JULES

I've got my dad's car. I'll take you

home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.

That sounds good.
