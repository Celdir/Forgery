LARRY

Come on.

CAROL

What?

LARRY

You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without

being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you

next week.

CAROL

I know, honey, I promised. I know.

LARRY

I already bought the earplugs.

CAROL

Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see

the puck.

CAROL

Yay, hooray.

LARRY

God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.

CAROL

know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve

victims, dismembered them and ate them.

LARRY

Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.

CAROL

Yeah, I'll say.

PAUL (voice over)

Hold the elevator.

LILLIAN (voice over)

I'm coming.

PAUL (voice over)

Hold the elevator.

LILLIAN

That's right.

PAUL

Thank you.

LILLIAN

I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.

CAROL

Oh, you do ?

LILLIAN

Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.

CAROL

Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.

LILLIAN

It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.

CAROL

Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.

LILLIAN

Exercising changed my life.

CAROL

Well, geez...

LARRY

I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.

PAUL

We bought a treadmill last week.

CAROL

Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it

because it was just taking up too much space.

LILLIAN

Oh, it-it-it...

LARRY

Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a

while. That was her problem.

LILLIAN

Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all

those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never

gonna get that.

CAROL

Oh, I know. It's late.

LILLIAN

It's so wonderful, meeting.

CAROL

Oh, well, yeah.

PAUL

It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never

meet them... You guys...

LILLIAN

... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...

and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.

PAUL

Well, anyway... good night.

CAROL (voice over)

Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...

LILLIAN

Oh, uh, say, hello ?

CAROL (voice over)

Huh ? Yeah ?

LILLIAN

Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and

have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.

CAROL

Oh, oh well that'd be fine...

PAUL (voice over)

She makes great Irish coffee.

LILLIAN (voice over)

Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill

lesson.

LARRY

There's a movie on television I want to watch.

CAROL

Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,

then believe me, anybody can.

LILLIAN

Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You

know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...

CAROL (voice over)

No. Please, it's easy.

LILLIAN

Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.

CAROL (voice over)

What ?

LILLIAN

That I know.

CAROL (voice over)

You're that advanced ?

LILLIAN

Well, yeah.

CAROL (voice over)

God, I only got to level two.

LILLIAN

Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?

CAROL

That's amazing.

LILLIAN

I can't understand this even.

CAROL

Let me see.

LILLIAN

Yeah, well. See this ?

CAROL

Okay.

PAUL

Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and

very beautiful.

LARRY

Yeah.

PAUL

Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because

it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.

LARRY

Uh, it's hard for me.

PAUL

Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in

the corner.

LARRY

That tiny thing there ?

PAUL

Interesting, yeah.

LARRY

Ah, you have a really...

PAUL

That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a

commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite

valuable, too.

LARRY

Yes.

PAUL

Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become

a real f...

LARRY

Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?

PAUL

Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.

LARRY

I should be going.

PAUL

What do you do, if I may ask ?

LARRY

Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.

PAUL

Are you really ?

LARRY

Yeah.

PAUL

I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.

LARRY

Oh.

PAUL

Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is

not what it used to be.

PAUL

Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work.

Even the perforations are still intact.

LARRY

Where's Carol ?

PAUL

All the...

LARRY

Because I should really be going, actually.

PAUL

Oh, really ?

LARRY

Yeah. I mean, so, we...

LILLIAN

Coffee's ready !

LARRY

Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.

PAUL (voice over)

Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.

LILLIAN

Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to

empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?

CAROL

Brown.

LILLIAN

Oh.

PAUL

Nice color.

LILLIAN

Paul never attended college. He's self-made.

PAUL

Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most

important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then

money.

LARRY

You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...

LILLIAN

And, do you work ?

CAROL

Huh ? Do I ?

LILLIAN

Yes.

CAROL

Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency,

but that was many years ago.

CAROL

But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a

little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me

out of it.

LARRY

Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel

omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with

truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal

position and have you in bed screaming for a month.

CAROL

He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic

food.

LILLIAN

My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything

with fat.

CAROL

Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a

dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to

exercise for a month to work it off.

LILLIAN

Yeah.

PAUL (voice over)

We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.

CAROL

No, really ?

LILLIAN (voice over)

Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.

CAROL (voice over)

Really ?

PAUL

Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?

LILLIAN

We already have twin cemetery plots.

LARRY

Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste.

You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On

her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.

CAROL

Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.

LARRY

Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even

know her size. I'm going over.

LARRY

Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little

longer in there ?

LARRY

I was signaling you frantically.

CAROL

I was just trying to be neighborly.

LARRY

Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one

more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you

know, look at canceled postage.

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're

looking forward to their anniversary.

LARRY

Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.

I don't know why they put it on so late.

CAROL

You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?

LARRY (voice over)

What ?

CAROL

Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another

dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you

know...

LARRY (voice over)

We are a dull aging couple.

CAROL

Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery

plots ?

LARRY

No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in

their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did

you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted

dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the

San Andrea's Fault.

CAROL

How often do you think they make love ?

LARRY (voice over)

Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You

know, I'm sure as much as once a week.

CAROL

Larry ?

LARRY (voice over)

I'm exhausted. What ?

CAROL

Do you still find me attractive ?

LARRY (voice over)

Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.

CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)

Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old

shoes, are we ? Do you think ?

LARRY (voice over)

Never comfortable.

CAROL

No ?

LARRY

I don't think you have to worry about that.

LARRY (voice over)

How you guys doing ?

SY (voice over)

We're fine.

MARILYN (voice over)

We're good.

SY (voice over)

We like that. We're gonna get this one.

MARILYN (voice over)

That's very nice, actually.

LARRY (voice over)

So, actually...

MARILYN (voice over)

Listen, are we going to see you at Elaine's Thursday ?

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, no. Thursday's our Wagner opera.

MARILYN

Uh...hum. You know... Ted's coming to Elaine's with us.

CAROL

Ted.

MARILYN

Yeah.

CAROL

How is Ted ?

MARILYN

He's... he seems to be doing well. I mean, I... I actually

think he's glad... I think he's glad he's divorced.

SY

Well, I don't think he's... no, he's not doing... Come on,

he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it.

MARILYN

Well he looks... I think he looks, you know, like he's

glad.

SY

Yeah, yeah. This.

LARRY

So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...

SY

No, we're gonna go to a movie.

MARILYN

Yeah, we're gonna go see Double indemnity.

CAROL

Oh, really ?

MARILYN

Yeah.

SY

Why don't you come with us ?

MARILYN

It starts in a little while.

BARTON KEYES (played by Edward G. Robinson)

I'd have the police after her so fast, it'd make her head

spin. They'd put her through the wringer. And brother, the

things they would squeeze out.

WALTER NEFF (played by Fred MacMurray)

They haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.

BARTON KEYES

Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year

experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of

concrete in my stomach.

CAROL

God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?

LARRY

Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites.

CAROL

I loved it.

LARRY

It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.

CAROL

You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must

be somebody in your office.

LARRY

Ted ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush

on you.

CAROL

Me ?

LARRY

Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...

CAROL

Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's

like a girlfriend to me.

LARRY

Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?

CAROL

Do I detect a note of jealousy ?

NEIGHBOR (voice over)

I had to come up here and call nine-one-one.

ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

So what's the trouble ?

ANOTHER NEIGHBOR

Oh, is that the-that the E.M.S.

ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

That guy's so excited.

ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

The doctor and the E.M.S.

LARRY

What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?

TALL NEIGHBOR

She had a heart attack.

CAROL (voice over)

Oh my God !

TALL NEIGHBOR

Sh-She's dead.

LARRY (voice over)

She-she's dead ?

CAROL (voice over)

Dead ?

NEIGHBOR (voice over)

They're giving Mr. House a sedative right now. He's running

around like crazy.

TALL NEIGHBOR

I called E.M.S. and they got here as soon as they could,

but it was too late.

LARRY

Sh-We just met her last night.

OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR (voice over)

Awful, just awful.

LARRY (voice over)

What happened ?

DOCTOR

Well, it was a classic coronary. She just went like that.

CAROL

Is there anything we can do ?

LARRY

Oh, my God.

DOCTOR (voice over)

You can be good neighbors. You know, we calmed him down,

uh...

LARRY

Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just

met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.

TALL NEIGHBOR

Such a... S... Such a nice lady.

OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR

Nice lady.

NEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE

Sweet person.

CAROL

God, okay.

LARRY

You look wonderful.

CAROL

Oh, hallo.

PAUL

Hi.

CAROL

Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.

PAUL

Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.

CAROL

Oh.

PAUL

It was quite nice of you.

CAROL

That's... sure.

LARRY

If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need,

just tell us and we'll...

CAROL

No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such

a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she

seemed so... God, well, healthy.

LARRY

Yeah.

PAUL

She had a heart condition.

CAROL

She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...

LARRY

Ah.

PAUL

She wouldn't have.

CAROL

No. Right. Well...

LARRY

If there's anything we can do.

CAROL

Yeah, anything. Really.

LARRY

You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by.

You know.

PAUL

Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.

CAROL

Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I

haven't forgotten.

PAUL

Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.

CAROL

Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.

PAUL

Oh, enjoy.

LARRY

My favorite, my favorite.

PAUL

Goodnight.

LARRY

Goodnight.

CAROL

Goodnight.

LARRY

Come, we're gonna be late.

CAROL (voice over)

The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you

watch the whole opera.

LARRY

I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to

get the urge to conquer Poland.

SY

I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen

to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night

they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.

CAROL

Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready

to go.

TED

Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like,

a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.

LARRY

No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This

guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage

stamps. He's a-a boring old...

TED

Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is

on the stamp.

CAROL

She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.

LARRY

Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs.

House and I have a bad heart.

CAROL

Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy

in the first five minutes.

SY

It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is

to talk about a heart condition.

TED

You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol

desserts. Is that what you said ?

LARRY

So, she had one too many.

CAROL

No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.

LARRY

So she wasn't on a diet. But...

TED

This would be a really great way to kill somebody.

SY

How ?

TED

You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate

mousse, butter. They go like that.

SY

LARRY

TED

LARRY

TED

MARILYN

SY

MARILYN

SY

MARILYN

TED

MARILYN

TED

LARRY

MARILYN

CAROL

TED

LARRY

TED

LARRY

I know, but...

CAROL

Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his

idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean...

TED

Yes, I had...

SY

Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you

just can't take that lightly. You can't be cavalier about a

restaurant.

CAROL

I'm not being cavalier about it.

LARRY

Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be

there every night.

SY

Absolutely.

LARRY

You'd be stuck there, you know.

TED

Wait. Look, look.

LARRY

They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap...

CAROL

But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry.

TED

She'll cook... She's great. She's-She's a pro. She's a pro.

She'll be cooking... She'll be cooking in the kitchen. I'll

be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in

Casablanca.

SY

It's not that easy.

MARILYN

You do it anyway. Right as well get paid for it.

LARRY

Right. Directs...

TED

I'm set, I'm serious about it. I don't... I mean, it's not

like a hobby. I mean, it's gotta be a serious thing.

SY

I'll be the first customer.

LARRY

You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin.

You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an

argument over penis envy, or something.

CAROL

Oh.

LARRY

The poor guy suffers from it so...

CAROL

Did he seem a little too cheerful ?

LARRY

No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh,

when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy

lit up like Mr. Glowworm.

CAROL

The restaurant ?

LARRY

Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart

in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing

his hands.

CAROL

No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House.

Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?

LARRY (voice over)

Mr. House, our next-door widower ?

CAROL

Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't

he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't

you think ?

LARRY (voice over)

Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the

street sobbing hysterically ?

CAROL

Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly

looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and,

and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped

dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I...

You know...

LARRY (voice over)

Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like

those remarks. And, meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a

physical check-up.

CAROL

Oh, I don't know.

LARRY (voice over)

Uh, uh.

CAROL

I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ?

Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, Have a

nice time, you know, at the opera. And, my God, We're

certainly dressed up. I mean, you know. This guy should be

a wreck.

LARRY

Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme

out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all

the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.

CAROL

Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.

LARRY

Yeah ?

CAROL

She's too mousey.

LARRY

Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their

little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.

LARRY

Oh, Christ.

LARRY

Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You

know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning

watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.

CAROL

Who is it ?

LARRY

Ted. For you.

CAROL

Ted, hi.

TED

I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a

coronary. He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and

then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic

levels.

CAROL

No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too

perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose

beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.

LARRY

Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just

joking.

CAROL

Yeah, I know.

LARRY

Let me speak to him, all right ?

CAROL

What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr...

LARRY

Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart

attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He

said to.... He was an old man.

TED

How do you know it was a real doctor ?

LARRY

I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep.

Look...

TED

Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on,

I called about something else. Listen, I know a great

location for a restaurant.

TED

Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ?

CAROL

Well, it's dark.

TED

Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have

to go through a little cave.

CAROL

Oh, I see.

TED

And then you come out, to this here.

CAROL

Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful.

TED

Yeah. Isn't it great ?

CAROL

But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't

it ?

TED

No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal,

because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked

away back in here like this.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah.

TED (voice over)

And, you don't want street traffic. You want...

CAROL (voice over)

No.

TED (voice over)

you want a little out of the way spot that people hear

about and lovers go to.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah.

TED (voice over)

It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few

tables.

CAROL (voice over)

You know, you've really thought this out.

TED (voice over)

Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July,

when we were married.

CAROL (voice over)

Uh uh. Right.

TED

Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's

gorgeous at night.

CAROL

It's beautiful, I bet.

TED

I used to think, What am I doing here with July ? We don't

love each other any more, you know ? It made the moment

doubly poignant.

PAUL

Hi. How are you ?

CAROL

Hi. How are you ?

PAUL

Oh, my...

CAROL

These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue.

PAUL

I love it. Come on in, come on in.

CAROL

Well, okay.

PAUL

This is unbelievable.

CAROL

I know, it's just...

PAUL

Did you do it ?

CAROL

I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is

vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles.

PAUL

Well, come on in.

CAROL

Do you like chocolate truffles ?

PAUL

Would you share it with me ?

LARRY

Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...

CAROL

Oh, well...

PAUL

No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee.

Please.

LARRY

They're only half a dozen.

CAROL

No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better.

Let me make it.

PAUL

Oh, you've already done so much.

CAROL

No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax.

PAUL

Aren't you nice.

CAROL

Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough.

LARRY

She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?

PAUL

Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get

away from here. From this place and all its memories.

LARRY

Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...

PAUL

I have a brother in Florida.

LARRY

Oh, really ?

PAUL

I'm hoping he can get away for a while.

LARRY

Good. It's a good idea.

PAUL

Do you like snorkeling ?

LARRY

Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored

fish are staring at me face to face, you know.

PAUL

Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.

LARRY

Oh, stamps. Well, that's...

PAUL

Come on, look at these.

PAUL

This is very delicious.

CAROL

Thank you.

PAUL

You are an artist.

CAROL

Well, thanks very much. Uh, was it a large... funeral ?

PAUL

Oh, no. We had... very few friends, no family.

CAROL

Right. Just a simple affair, uh ? Well, they're the best,

aren't they ?

PAUL

Yeah.

CAROL

I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know,

I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery

plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just

such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ?

Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin

cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that

is ? Remember ?

LARRY

Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity

with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those

guys, now.

PAUL

Yes.

CAROL (voice over)

Yes but, I was just wondering where, um, where is the

cemetery ?

PAUL

Oh, it's... uh, in... uh, it's in Nyack. We used to summer

there occasionally.

LARRY

What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?

CAROL

Listen, Larry.

LARRY

You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I

knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked

up on it quickly.

CAROL

Listen.

LARRY

But I... You know, we...

CAROL

Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making

the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his

cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this

urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.

LARRY

Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?

CAROL

Larry, he had her cremated !

LARRY

How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were

ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?

CAROL

Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?

LARRY

Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his

accountant, his cat. Who knows ?

CAROL (voice over)

Right, right. Hidden, uh ? Hidden away ?

LARRY

What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.

CAROL

Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay ? He lied.

LARRY (voice over)

Look. Maybe-maybe-maybe he is embarrassed. Maybe he didn't

want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he-he told

us that-uh... You know, what's the difference ? Who are you

calling ?

CAROL

Ted !

LARRY

Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a

poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah. Where ? Oh, I know where, ah ah. Snorkeling, right ?

Ah ah.

LARRY

So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh,

sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with

squid.

CAROL

Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a

big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?

LARRY

Too much Double Indemnity, you know ?

CAROL

Hu-Huh.

(speaking on the phone)

Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our

neighbor's apartment, right ?

CAROL

Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in

it. Only he says he had his wife buried.

TED

That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy. You don't

want something discovered, you know ? Like-like poison.

CAROL

Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?

TED

Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of different kinds of

exotic poisons, you know ?

CAROL

Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean,

why-why would he lie at all ?

LARRY

Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping

into a mad obsession.

CAROL

Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great.

Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing,

okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay,

bye.

LARRY

Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?

CAROL

Hey, I'm not tired.

LARRY

What do you mean, You're not tired ?

CAROL

You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home,

tomorrow.

LARRY

Great.

CAROL

You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why

you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be

living next door to a murderer, Larry.

LARRY

Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.

CAROL

Oh my God !

LARRY

Hey, are you okay ?

CAROL

Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the

hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I

think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.

LARRY

Yeah ? You're sure ?

CAROL

Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it

was him.

LARRY

So-So-So what ?

CAROL

Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?

LARRY

So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.

CAROL

I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the

morning ?

LARRY

Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the

difference ?

CAROL

But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about

living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm

saying ? A joke ?

LARRY

All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator.

It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I

mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You

woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early

tomorrow morning.

CAROL

I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna

ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.

LARRY (voice over)

You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ?

CAROL

Yes, because this is really...

LARRY (voice over)

What are you talking about ?

CAROL

It's very sus...

LARRY

Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...

CAROL

Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.

LARRY

Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy

alone. You're crazy. Stop it.

CAROL

That's one ring.

LARRY

So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.

CAROL

Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.

LARRY

Give me this. Give me this.

CAROL

What are you doing ?

LARRY

Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call

downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.

CAROL

All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.

LARRY

Ask if someone went out.

CAROL

Keep ringing.

LARRY

Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.

CAROL

Oh, man.

LARRY (voice over)

This is insane. What's gotten into you ?

CAROL

I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one-

thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ?

LARRY (voice over)

It's not your business. He can go any place he wants.

CAROL (in the phone)

Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody

just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ?

You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.

LARRY

Okay. Are you happy ?

CAROL

I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.

LARRY

Now, can we back to bed ?

CAROL

No.

LARRY

For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a

mystery where nothing exists.

CAROL

Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it.

Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry...

Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?

LARRY

You know, I'm gonna...

CAROL

No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.

LARRY

I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in

the middle of the night.

CAROL

I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the

basement.

LARRY

Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?

CAROL

He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he

opened... he could... he has the...

LARRY

So what ? So what ?

CAROL

What do you mean, so what ? He's...

LARRY

What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out

in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went

someplace.

CAROL

All right. So, I'm right, though.

LARRY

That's all.

CAROL

I mean, I'm right.

LARRY

I mean, so you're right. So big deal.

CAROL

Yes, he isn't in his apartment.

LARRY

But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So,

you're right. You're suspicious.

CAROL

Yeah, that's right.

LARRY

It says more about your mind that about him.

CAROL

What about your rigidity ? How about that ?

LARRY

Get into bed. Get into bed.

CAROL

How about that point ?

LARRY

You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !

CAROL

Hi !

CAROL

Jack ?

CAROL

Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I

got a leak in the kitchen ?

JACK

Well, yeah. Yeah.

CAROL

You can ?

JACK

Sure.

CAROL

Well, but, it will be this afternoon.

JACK

But I... I got...

CAROL

All right, you're not gonna go now ?

JACK

I'll be back in about a minute.

CAROL

In a minute.

JACK

Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.

TED

Hallo ?

CAROL

Ted... I'm in his apartment.

CAROL

The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have

been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this

bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his

satchel.

TED

Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you.

TED

No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from

your apartment.

CAROL

He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two

tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges

Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.

NEIGHBOR

Oh. Hi. How are you ?

PAUL

Good morning. How are you ?

NEIGHBOR

Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance

increase ?

PAUL

No. When did that happen ?

CAROL

I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here,

okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm

just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just

the craziest thing I've ever done.

TED

Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything

crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave.

PAUL

Hallo.

PAUL (voice over)

Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I

made all the arrangements.

PAUL

Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you

later, okay ? Okay.

PAUL (voice over)

Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ?

Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you

tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you.

LARRY

So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you

helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little

bit, but, uh...

MARCIA

Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...

LARRY

That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry

about, you know ? This book makes Finnegan's Wake look

like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's-

It's-It's...

MARCIA

You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take

suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.

LARRY

No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.

Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much

of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how

much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own

life ?

MARCIA

Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film

critic.

LARRY (voice over)

Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?

MARCIA

No, but I put myself through school playing poker.

LARRY

Oh, really ? Do you still play ?

MARCIA (voice over)

No, but I still know how.

LARRY

Yes ? Are you good ?

MARCIA (voice over)

Yeah.

LARRY

Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.

MARCIA (voice over)

I could turn your game around in two hours.

LARRY

Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have

all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write

so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,

uh, too good to be true.

MARCIA

Well, I wouldn't say beautiful.

LARRY (voice over)

Oh, I would.

MARCIA

But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.

LARRY

Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?

MARCIA (voice over)

No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do

you ask ?

LARRY

Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I

know he would get a big kick out of you.

MARCIA (voice over)

Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?

LARRY

Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we

could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you

could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.

MARCIA (voice over)

How about a cheeseburger right now ?

LARRY

Now ? That's a possibility.

LARRY

You know, we could, we could do...

(talking into the telephone)

Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?

LARRY (voice over)

Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.

LARRY

I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or

so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.

LARRY

I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing

I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week,

or something.

MARCIA

Story of my life !

LARRY

What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you

nuts ?

CAROL

Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.

LARRY

A fuddy-dud ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do

that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and

entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For

crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.

CAROL

It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.

LARRY

Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up

rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just

steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.

CAROL

Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ?

Okay ?

LARRY

I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.

CAROL

He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named

Helen Moss.

LARRY

Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.

CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

I told Ted.

LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

You told Ted before you told me ?

CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things.

LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I

don't break the law, you know ?

CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

Yeah.

LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull.

CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ?

LARRY

I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.

CAROL

He talked on the phone with a woman.

LARRY

How do you know ?

CAROL

Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you

know, so...

LARRY

He did ?

CAROL

Yeah, but I hid under the bed.

LARRY

You hid under his bed ?

CAROL

He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.

LARRY

I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...

CAROL

He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you

know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry,

it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together. That

kind of thing.

LARRY

But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?

CAROL

I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.

LARRY

That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.

CAROL

No, I c...

LARRY

He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What

do you...

CAROL

Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He

called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss

woman, right ?

LARRY

I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.

CAROL

And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he

leaves this message, and he says : Tell her Tom called.

You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.

LARRY

Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I

don't care. I don't wanna hear.

CAROL

Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...

LARRY

I just don't...

CAROL

I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think

a private eye could have done any better than me. I put

everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I

made one mistake.

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

I left my reading glasses on his table.

CAROL

Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate

mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.

PAUL

Well, thank you.

CAROL

I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at

something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that

for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's

still fresh.

LARRY

And you can divide it up and we can all have some.

CAROL

That'd be great. That's a great idea.

LARRY

You'll really like this dessert.

PAUL

Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.

CAROL

Okay, that'd be really good.

LARRY

Yeah, that's great.

CAROL (WHISPERING)

Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here

somewhere. The first... Wait. I should...

(to Paul, with a much louder voice)

Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need...

CAROL

You need any help ?

PAUL

No, I'm fine. I'll be right in.

CAROL (voice over)

Um... Okay, great.

LARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice)

Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ?

PAUL (voice over from the kitchen)

Coffee or tea ?

CAROL

Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.

PAUL

You know, I found your glasses.

CAROL

Mine ?

PAUL

These are yours, aren't they ?

CAROL

Yes.

LARRY

No.

CAROL

Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh,

God.

LARRY

No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually.

They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.

CAROL

They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine.

I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I

must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.

PAUL

Did you ? I didn't notice that.

CAROL

No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying

that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?

LARRY

At your mother's house.

CAROL

That's right. Of course, so...

PAUL

That mousse looks fabulous.

CAROL

Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.

PAUL

Thank you very much.

CAROL

Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in

the Caribbean ?

PAUL

Very much. Very much.

CAROL

Uh uh.

PAUL

That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.

CAROL

That's because I must have dropped them and they probably

got kicked under.

LARRY

Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...

CAROL

They were just...

LARRY

She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around

the house.

CAROL

They f...

PAUL

The mousse ?

LARRY

She's always-She's always kick...

CAROL

Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse.

LARRY

Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the

mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It

was...

CAROL

I remember.

LARRY

It took-took six months to get the...

TED (voice over)

Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder.

CAROL

I know, but where... where are we going ?

TED (voice over from inside the car)

I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Yeah.

TED (voice over from inside the car)

It was just H. Moss.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Right.

TED (voice over from inside the car)

So I-it's on Bank Street...

TED (voice over from inside the car)

Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance.

I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this...

I called this number.

TED

There's her house.

CAROL

Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ?

TED

Yeah.

CAROL

Okay.

TED

Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her,

she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she,

maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of

that ?

CAROL

Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're

just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes,

like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you

know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little

shot of adrenaline.

TED

Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something.

CAROL

Yeah? What's that, there ?

TED

You want ? They're jelly doughnuts. You want a jelly

doughnut ?

CAROL (with a disgusted tone in her voice)

Ooh.

TED

Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it.

CAROL

Okay.

TED

Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look !

CAROL (voice over)

What ? What ? What ? What ?

TED (yelling in voice over)

Helen ! Helen !

(Back to a normal low voice)

Duck, duck, duck !

CAROL (voice over)

Ted! God, oh...Oh.

TED (yelling in voice over)

Helen !

TED

It's not her.

CAROL

It's not her ?

TED

No, it's not her.

TED

What...

CAROL

Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?

TED

I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ?

CAROL

Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has

writers hours.

TED

I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and

me.

CAROL

Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?

TED

Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and

Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of

France ?

CAROL

Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

TED

And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to

pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and-

breakfast place.

CAROL

Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?

TED

Yeah.

CAROL

And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together,

right ?

TED

Yeah, but not a bed.

CAROL (voice over)

No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest

that.

TED

Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it.

CAROL

No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because

of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux,

remember ?

TED

It could have been our little secret, then you passed out.

CAROL

Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago,

doesn't it ?

TED

Not that long ago.

TED

Look, look, look, look.

CAROL

Oh, what ?

TED (yelling in voice over)

Helen !

(with a softer voice)

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck !

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, god, yeah. Right.

TED (voice over)

She didn't see us. She didn't see us.

CAROL (voice over)

No ? No. That's gotta be her.

TED (voice over)

I'll bet it's...

CAROL (voice over)

Are you sure ?

TED (voice over)

I mean, she answered to Helen.

CAROL (voice over)

She answers to... She's pretty.

TED (voice over)

Yeah, I'll say.

CAROL (voice over)

She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a...

TED (voice over)

She's getting a cab.

CAROL (voice over)

Okay, okay. Hold on.

TED (voice over)

Keep-Keep down.

CAROL (voice over)

Okay, don't worry. Don't worry.

TED (voice over)

I'm gonna follow her.

CAROL (voice over)

All right.

PAUL (voice over)

Watch your step. It's very steep. Be careful.

HELEN

Oh, this is beautiful.

PAUL

Isn't it ?

HELEN

Yeah.

PAUL (voice over)

Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred

Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival.

HELEN (voice over)

Oh, yeah ?

PAUL (voice over)

Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start

renovating.

HELEN (voice over)

Mm. Oh, Paul, I...

PAUL (voice over)

Oh, come on, there's nobody around.

HELEN (voice over)

I-I...

PAUL (voice over)

Come on.

HELEN (voice over)

Okay.

HELEN (voice over)

I've never been behind a movie screen before like this.

PAUL (voice over)

Strange, isn't it ?

HELEN (voice over)

Yeah.

PAUL (voice over)

Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was

better.

HELEN

Oh.

PAUL

Beautiful, huh ? Look around.

HELEN

All these mirrors.

PAUL

Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite

beautiful.

PAUL (voice over)

I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along

with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage

shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies.

HELEN

It has such a lonely feeling.

PAUL

That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant,

Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm

gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy.

HELEN

It sure will.

PAUL

What's that noise ?

HELEN

Where ?

PAUL (voice over)

Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early.

GLADYS

Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm

sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought...

PAUL (voice over)

It's quite all right.

GLADYS

But, but, uh...

PAUL (voice over)

It's quite all right.

GLADYS

I apologize.

PAUL (voice over)

Quite all right.

GLADYS

All right.

HELEN (voice over)

I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this

modeling.

PAUL (voice over)

Maybe you won't have to work at all.

CAROL (whispering in voice over)

Oh, my God.

LARRY

What's the matter ?

CAROL (voice over)

Larry, come with me, okay ?

LARRY

Oh, Geez, I was...

CAROL (voice over)

Come on.

LARRY

I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.

CAROL

Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.

LARRY

Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...

CAROL

Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his

apartment. Yeah.

LARRY

What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?

CAROL

Listen.

LARRY

It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...

CAROL

He'll never be back, Larry.

LARRY

What ? What ?

CAROL

No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour

and a half.

LARRY

What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't

do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie

house, you-you said there was nothing happening.

CAROL

No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type,

and they were talking about money.

LARRY

Well, so what ? That's the...

CAROL

So, that's the motive.

LARRY

What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.

CAROL

What are you talking about ?

LARRY

Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look.

CAROL

Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?

LARRY

I've been thinking about you.

CAROL

What do you mean ?

LARRY

I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go

back to your shrink.

CAROL

What do you m...

LARRY

I want you to see Doctor Ballard again.

CAROL

Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.

LARRY

I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...

CAROL

Just come... come on.

LARRY

You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ?

Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.

CAROL

Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.

LARRY

You got... No. No.

CAROL

Five. Only five.

LARRY

I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command

you to sleep !

CAROL

Well, I didn't...

LARRY

Sleep ! I command it !

CAROL

No, I...

LARRY

I command it ! Sleep !

CAROL

Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years

ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if

you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery

once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic

mystery.

LARRY

Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.

CAROL

That's right. So...

LARRY

But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.

CAROL

This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So,

I'm right.

LARRY

No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to

go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I

forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be

forbidding you a lot, if you do...

CAROL

Oh, damn it.

LARRY

Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many

cuddling positions.

CAROL

Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.

LARRY

This is wrong.

CAROL

Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay,

I got it. I got it.

LARRY

This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to

great unhappiness.

CAROL

Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?

LARRY

Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange

man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.

CAROL

Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try

something here... Yeah.

LARRY

What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is

he, your mentor ?

CAROL

Um, Last number dialed.

LARRY

Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...

CAROL

Just be quiet for a second, all right ?

CAROL

Shhh !

LARRY

I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart

is....

CAROL

Larry.

MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE

Waldron.

CAROL

Uh, who ?

MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE

Who is this ? Who do you want ?

CAROL

Um, who's this ?

CAROL

Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?

LARRY

Hang the phone up.

CAROL

Just be quiet. Okay, wait.

LARRY

Hang the phone up, now.

CAROL

Oh, great. Now they-they hung up on us.

LARRY

Good, good.

CAROL

Oh, great.

LARRY

Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.

CAROL

No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ?

Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom

Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.

LARRY

Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to

the morgue ? You got all the jargon.

CAROL

Come on.

LARRY

Where are you going ?

CAROL

Right.

LARRY

I'm not a night person. I don't wanna be... What are you...

I don't know what I'm looking for.

CAROL

Oh, oh, wait. Look.

LARRY

What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ?

This is insane.

CAROL

What do you mean ?

LARRY

Oh, my...

LARRY

Jesus. Oh, Christ !

CAROL

What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean

it up.

LARRY

What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do,

vacuum ?

CAROL

Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?

LARRY

I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his-

his... porcelain...

CAROL

Well then glue it. Glue it back to...

LARRY

What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?

CAROL

Oh, look. Look.

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

Look.

LARRY

So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.

CAROL

So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau

in this kind of weather ? Uh ?

LARRY

Let's get out of here, because this is a...

CAROL

I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left

these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really

sinister.

LARRY

It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go

to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.

CAROL

What ?

LARRY

Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll

get rid of them.

CAROL

So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?

NICK

I loved it, I...

CAROL

I know.

NICK

I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so...

CAROL

I know.

LARRY

Right.

CAROL

I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?

NICK

Well, I...

LARRY

If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town

just a couple of more hours.

NICK

I know. I was going to, but I...

CAROL

Well, what about that ?

NICK

They're working us so hard at school. I can't.

CAROL

Oh.

NICK

I gotta get right back.

CAROL

Really.

LARRY

I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And-

And-And, uh...

NICK

Brooks Brothers. Yeah.

LARRY

Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.

CAROL

You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?

NICK

Yeah. A sweater.

LARRY

She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?

CAROL

Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know

something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?

LARRY

Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.

CAROL

What ?

LARRY

I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...

MARCIA

Hi, Larry.

LARRY

Hi. How are you ?

MARCIA

Good. How are you doing ?

LARRY

This is my wife.

CAROL

Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...

LARRY

You snuck around.

CAROL

Carol. Remember me ?

LARRY

Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.

CAROL

Oh, hi.

MARCIA

Hi.

LARRY

My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...

MARCIA

Good to see you.

LARRY

It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.

NICK

Nick. How are you doing ?

LARRY

It's a tradition we have in the family.

MARCIA

That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to

dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint.

LARRY

Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...

CAROL

Oh, you did.

LARRY

Yeah. That place that we ate at.

CAROL

Well, very nice. That's lovely.

LARRY

He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.

MARCIA

Great. Great.

LARRY

That's great. So.

MARCIA

Well, good to see you. Good to see you.

CAROL

Okay, you too.

MARCIA

Take care.

CAROL

Goodbye.

LARRY

Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.

CAROL

So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?

LARRY

S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.

CAROL

Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that...

LARRY

Ted's type ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented.

Yeah. I gave you...

CAROL

Thank you.

LARRY

You get your bag.

CAROL

You know, your pupils are dilating.

LARRY

No, she's dangerously sexual.

CAROL

I just wanted to tell you that.

LARRY

Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting,

honey...

CAROL

I see.

LARRY

Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you

drink...

NICK

Yeah. Don't drink too much, Mom.

LARRY

Yeah, spit... And spit it out.

CAROL

What do you mean ? Nick.

LARRY

They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ?

Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom

floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?

TED (voice over)

That Mouton 45. That was...

CAROL (voice over)

Didn't you love it ?

TED (voice over)

Oh, that was-was like, sublime, you know ?

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah.

TED (voice over)

And the inexpensive Spanish one. Wasn't that... wasn't that

a nice surprise ?

CAROL (voice over)

It was very, very...

TED (voice over)

Wasn't that great ?

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah.

TED (voice over)

Look at these paintings. Look at this.

CAROL (voice over)

So, uh...

TED

I love the blue in that.

CAROL

So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...

TED

Yeah, yeah, well, you know. He's...

CAROL

His favorite writer.

TED

He says she's wonderful, and I'm...

CAROL

Oh.

TED

I'm trying to do everything I can to get out and meet

people, you know.

CAROL

Sure.

TED

I'm-I'm not looking forward to this.

CAROL

So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?

TED

Yeah.

CAROL

Is that what you're...

TED

I-I guess. She's not my first choice.

CAROL

No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.

TED

Yeah, it's great. Of course, I can't have my first choice.

CAROL

No ?

TED

I'm getting drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.

CAROL

You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.

TED

I'm gonna be late for my shrink. I've got a...

CAROL

You've got to go, huh ?

TED

Yeah.

CAROL

Okay.

TED

Well, you know, you would be my first choice.

CAROL

Me, huh ?

TED

Yeah.

CAROL

Well. Oh, boy.

TED

Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna

go east. Do you...

CAROL

Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I

need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy.

TED

I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ?

CAROL

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend

me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered.

Well, anyway.

TED

See you later.

CAROL

See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.

TED

Sorry. Excuse me.

CAROL

Excuse me.

LARRY

I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick,

today.

LARRY (voice over)

Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid

looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook

dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole.

CAROL (voice over)

Well, no wonder he had her cremated.

LARRY

What ?

CAROL (voice over)

Mrs. House.

LARRY

Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought

we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich

lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.

CAROL

Larry.

LARRY (voice over)

What ?

CAROL

I just saw Mrs. House.

LARRY (voice over)

What are you talking about ? The ashes ?

CAROL

No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.

LARRY

Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was

this, the bus to heaven ?

CAROL

No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you

something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually

saw her.

LARRY

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold

compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back,

or...

CAROL

No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And

I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I

happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it,

Larry.

LARRY

Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit

it out ?

CAROL

I...

LARRY

I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine-

tasting ?

CAROL

But ?

LARRY

You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I

said spit it out ?

CAROL

Yeah...

LARRY

I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why

you're this way.

CAROL

I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but

it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.

LARRY

Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.

CAROL

I ...

LARRY

How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead,

she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.

CAROL

Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that

you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?

LARRY

I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is

dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City

transit system.

CAROL

I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I

don't know what's going on.

LARRY

What's going on ?

CAROL

What's... yeah.

LARRY

Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ?

Is that enough ?

CAROL

I...

LARRY

Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now

forget this.

CAROL

Why ?

LARRY

Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot

fudge.

CAROL

Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...

CAROL

Oh. Oh, God.

CAROL

Hallo ? Ted. Ted.

LARRY

Oh, Ted. Ted.

CAROL

Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs.

House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman.

That's right.

LARRY

She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary,

folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know

what they're talking about.

CAROL

Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus,

you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left.

I was looking out the...

LARRY

He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.

CAROL

Would you ?

LARRY

They're both at the wine tasting.

CAROL

Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just

run a check on Paul and Lillian House.

LARRY

Don't run a check. Don't run a check.

CAROL

What are you talking...

LARRY

Stop.

CAROL

What are you doing ? I mean...

LARRY

Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is

falling apart.

CAROL

Larry, what are you... But, what ?

LARRY

Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with

the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.

CAROL

I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.

LARRY

Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car

fare.

CAROL

I s...Okay.

LARRY

Now, sit down. Let's...

CAROL

Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact

spot, Larry.

LARRY

Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.

CAROL

Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?

LARRY

No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...

CAROL

On... on your, on your lunch hour ?

LARRY

No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.

CAROL

Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.

LARRY

Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...

CAROL

I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I

mean, I saw this woman.

LARRY

Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.

CAROL

What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre.

LARRY (voice over)

What do you mean you're not go... We've been holding onto

these tickets for two months, now.

CAROL

Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you,

Larry ? Do you compr...

LARRY (voice over)

If you got a big story, tell it to the Police. Don't tell

it to me.

CAROL

What am I going to say to them ?

LARRY

Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie

story.

CAROL

What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing.

Unless... Oh !

LARRY

That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.

CAROL

Unless... Unless I locate her.

LARRY

Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're

going to the theater. I don't care what you say.

LARRY

Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died,

right? You saw her ?

CAROL

Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?

JACK

Yes, she was lying on the floor.

CAROL

You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was

her, right ?

LARRY

Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You

know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.

JACK

She was in that bag. Yeah.

LARRY

My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she

doesn't know what she's talking about.

CAROL

Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.

LARRY

Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix

the faucet, and you show up six months late.

JACK

Thanks.

CAROL

The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling

of Jack Daniel's, remember ?

LARRY

Yeah, but...

CAROL

I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.

LARRY

If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem

to feel she is, so...

CAROL

Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.

LARRY

Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.

CAROL

Shh !... Shh !...

CAROL

I mean, she...

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag.

I mean, somebody...

LARRY

She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep

quiet...

CAROL

Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.

LARRY

Shut up.

TED

Lillian House.

CAROL

Right.

TED

Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle,

Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard

House.

CAROL

Right, I know.

TED

She was not a twin. Had an older sister who...

CAROL

So goes Larry's theory.

TED

Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother

who died in nineteen-eighty-seven.

CAROL

Right here. This is it.

TED

This is where we were.

CAROL (voice over)

This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right

here, after you left.

TED

Right.

CAROL

And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I

looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.

TED

You saw her after I left ?

CAROL

Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was,

like.

TED

Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw

her ? You saw her face ?

CAROL

I'm positive I-I saw her.

CAROL

Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.

TED

What was the number of the bus ?

CAROL

Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know

that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously

was a cross-town bus.

TED

All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus.

CAROL

Right.

TED

Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down

there.

CAROL

So, okay. So, then, it's like...

TED

So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere.

CAROL

Then... Her destination was probably within the next five

or six blocks.

TED

Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll

see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue,

or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're

sure you saw her face ?

CAROL

Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?

TED

Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no.

CAROL

I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.

CAROL

Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the

end of the line.

TED

I think this is it.

CAROL

Look. The bus.

TED

I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out.

CAROL

Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...

TED

Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it.

CAROL

Yeah, I know.

TED

That's all there is, here.

CAROL

Well, what do you think ?

RED

What ?

CAROL

Do you think we should retrace our steps ?

TED

You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very

special...

CAROL

No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if

it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I

wore it with a pair of pants.

TED

Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with

pants.

CAROL

Oh.

TED

With pants, it's-it's... what ?

CAROL

Ted, look.

TED

At what ? What ?

CAROL (voice over)

That hotel.

TED (voice over)

What about it?

CAROL (voice over)

Well, that's... the Waldron. I mean, I thou... I-I was in

his apartment, I pressed the number... last number

dialed, and...

TED (voice over)

You're kidding.

CAROL (voice over)

And they answered the phone. And said... Waldron.

TED (voice over)

Let's-Let's-Let's get to a phone. Let's get to a phone.

Let's call up. You got a quarter ?

TED

Hallo ? Mrs. House, please ? Mrs... Mrs. House. Can you

ring her room for me, please ?

TED

Really ?

CAROL

Well ?

TED

What. Maybe... Well, maybe she checked out. No-nobody,

nobody at all. Uh... What about...?

CAROL

Wh-What about...

TED

Yeah, what about, uh, Helen Moss, Moss. You're sure ?

Nobody... nobody at all. All-All right. All right, okay.

I'm sorry. All right. Thank you. thank you.

CAROL

Great. Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again. Well ?

MARCIA

If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.

LARRY

So...

MARCIA

Got it ?

LARRY

I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I

can't...

MARCIA

That's how you wind up on welfare.

LARRY (voice over)

You know, I need the action, for some reason. I-I can't...

I bet anything. Okay, just...

MARCIA (voice over)

Cut ?

LARRY (voice over)

No, no, go ahead, I trust you. Lay it on me.

MARCIA

You seem in a strange mood.

LARRY

No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.

MARCIA

On Perrier ?

LARRY

No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.

MARCIA

Want any cards ?

LARRY

Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I,

possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh...

I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.

MARCIA

Four ?

LARRY

Yeah.

MARCIA

Cruising for a bruising.

LARRY

Inside and outside straight.

MARCIA

You're in trouble, now.

LARRY

You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is

becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really

bothering me.

MARCIA

Really.

LARRY

Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you

know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they

just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh,

you know, if this happens.

MARCIA

You must love her a lot.

LARRY

Yeah, I do. I do.

MARCIA

Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some

effort. I mean, who's the guy ?

LARRY

Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.

MARCIA

Ted.

LARRY

Yeah.

MARCIA

Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your

date.

LARRY

Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with-

with Carol.

CAROL

So, you bored ? I mean...

LARRY

Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.

CAROL

Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of

the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.

LARRY

Would you rather be here with Ted ?

CAROL

Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...

LARRY

More enthused ?

CAROL

Yeah, enthused, yeah.

LARRY

Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy.

CAROL

Well, I...

LARRY

You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.

CAROL

No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.

LARRY

You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy

scavenger hunt. He's the man.

CAROL

I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...

LARRY

Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took

you out on a date when we-we first started going out.

CAROL

What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason,

you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?

LARRY

Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this

corner.

CAROL

No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.

LARRY

Not to change the subject.

CAROL

You know, I...

LARRY

I took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first

date ?

CAROL

Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six

months.

LARRY

Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.

CAROL

Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be

conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?

CAROL

It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just,

like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a

dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the

threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole

thing is like. It's... Hey, no.

LARRY

Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.

CAROL

Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new

experiences.

LARRY

Let me ask you a personal question, here.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

Did you ever sleep with Ted ?

CAROL

Sleep ?

LARRY

Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...

CAROL

What, are you nuts ?

LARRY

We were on an eating tour of France, together.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You two guys spent an evening, you know, together.

CAROL

Yeah, right. We sp...

LARRY

At that place, you know.

CAROL

I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent

the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night,

and shared a...

LARRY

That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised

me.

CAROL

What ?

LARRY

You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp

and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you

want to defend me, you know.

CAROL

Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't

agree with, okay ?

LARRY

Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...

CAROL

Oh. Larry.

LARRY

Yeah.

CAROL (voice over)

Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her !

LARRY (voice over)

Oh my god, it is.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along,

wasn't I ?

LARRY (voice over)

Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ?

CAROL (voice over)

I'm positive. Yes.

LARRY (voice over)

Oh, my God.

CAROL (voice over)

Right ? Right ? I mean, I was...

LARRY

I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...

CAROL

I know. W-Well. Come on.

LARRY

That is her. Are you...

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

LARRY

CAROL

now. You know what I'm saying ?

LARRY

Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's

get out of here.

CAROL

No, wait. I got an idea.

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.

LARRY

How ? How ?

CAROL

Yeah, no. Come on.

CAROL

Uh, excuse me. Hi.

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Hi.

CAROL

Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come

in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot

three ? She had on a gray sweater ?

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Older woman ?

LARRY

And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella.

CAROL

Slightly older. Not...

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Mrs. Caine ?

LARRY

Mrs. Caine ?

CAROL

Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.

LARRY

Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.

CAROL

Yes.

LARRY

We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to

surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Oh.

CAROL

Yes, that's right. What room ?

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Uh, six-eleven.

CAROL

Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot.

HOTEL DAY CLERK

Okay. Sure.

LARRY

Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here,

so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care

of you, if you play ball with us.

LARRY

What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our

country.

CAROL (voice over)

Will you come on ?

LARRY

I'm coming, I'm coming.

CAROL

Come on. What're you doing ?

CAROL

Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.

LARRY

Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue

powder sprinkled along the baseboard.

CAROL

Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.

CAROL

Um, Mrs. House ?

LARRY

Mrs. House ?

CAROL (voice over)

M-Mrs. House ?

LARRY (voice over)

Hallo ?

CAROL

Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...

LARRY

I don't... I don't...

CAROL

My God, I don't...

LARRY

I don't think she's...

CAROL (voice over)

I don't see her.

LARRY (voice over)

This may not be the right-right place.

CAROL (voice over)

Just hold on, Larry. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

LARRY

There's nothing here.

CAROL

Ahhh ! Larry !

LARRY

What's the matter ?

CAROL

Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !

LARRY

Oh, Jesus.

CAROL

Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?

LARRY

What's the matter ?

CAROL

Hallo ?

LARRY

What-What-What...

CAROL

Mrs...Oh, Larry.

LARRY

What? What-What's...

CAROL

I think she's dead.

LARRY

Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.

CAROL

Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?

LARRY

Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !

CAROL

I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !

LARRY

Come on. Let's get out of here.

CAROL

Oh, my God.

LARRY

I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.

CAROL

Oh, God. Okay, oh God.

LARRY

This woman is forever dying.

LARRY

Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of

my ears.

LARRY

Get down those stairs.

CAROL

Okay, all right.

LARRY

Come on, come on. Quickly.

CAROL (talking together with Larry)

And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House,

right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what

hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And...

And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So

we were just sitting there, just waiting...

LARRY (talking together with Carol)

We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we

were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and

looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her

hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the

bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in

the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as

best as I could.

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

There's nobody up there.

CAROL

There's what ?

LARRY

What do you mean, there's nobody up...

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

There's nobody.

CAROL

Wait a minute, wait...

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

There's no body there.

CAROL

We-We saw...

LARRY

We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.

CAROL

We...

SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman)

Mike, check the basement with...

LARRY

She was totally dead.

CAROL

We... She's there.

LARRY

Wait, wait.

CAROL (voice over)

She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way.

LARRY (voice over)

Yeah, she was definitely laying here.

CAROL

Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you

understand ?

LARRY

The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled,

or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death,

because I wouldn't know.

CAROL

We're-We're two professional people.

LARRY

Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

I'm in publishing.

CAROL

Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little

restaurant, basically French, although international

cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...

LARRY

Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the

restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

Calm down. Calm down ! Please !

CAROL

Okay, just...

LARRY

Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you

guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body.

Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were

here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not

counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to

understand what I was saying.

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole

building, all right ?

CAROL

All right.

CAROL

Uh, did you check...

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

Mr. House...

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

...He's been at his place of business all day.

LARRY

Any witnesses ?

CAROL

Yeah, b...

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated.

CAROL

Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that,

did you ?

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

No, we didn't.

CAROL

No, okay.

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you

tell him ?

CAROL

No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here.

It's...

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

We think you should calm down and file a report.

CAROL

It's not... Oh !

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record.

CAROL

All right.

FIRST POLICE OFFICER

Take a card, give us a call, have a good day.

CAROL

Thank you. Thanks very much.

SECOND POLICE OFFICER

Bye-bye.

CAROL

Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...

LARRY

Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need

fourteen Zanacks or something.

CAROL

Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I

mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.

LARRY

Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia

Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.

CAROL

Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?

LARRY

Helen ? I don't know and...

CAROL

I think so.

LARRY

I don't want to know about this. I think we should change

our lives.

CAROL

No, think about it.

LARRY

We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You

know, start over maybe in Mexico.

CAROL

No, no, no.

LARRY

You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car

or something.

CAROL

I'm just beginning to calm down.

LARRY

I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was

like one of those television shows, where you open the

door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated

those shows.

CAROL

Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my

whole life.

LARRY

I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was

ninety-four years old.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.

CAROL

Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened

to us in our whole marriage ?

LARRY

This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like

something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you

know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th

avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life

at all.

CAROL

You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room

while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.

LARRY

Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep,

tonight. That'll be good for me.

CAROL

But you know, that probably means he saw us.

LARRY

Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean,

what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that,

but I'm a little drunk.

CAROL

I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?

LARRY

Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr.

House, because he has an alibi.

CAROL

Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.

LARRY

She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get

out of here. I want to go home.

LARRY

Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?

CAROL

Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million

theories about this, I'll tell you that.

LARRY

Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.

CAROL

Oh, right.

LARRY

You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel

room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall.

CAROL (voice over)

What ? Yeah ?

LARRY (voice over)

It's right up there. That's the room.

CAROL (voice over)

I know.

LARRY (voice over)

Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof ?

You know, that would be a possibility. Why would...

CAROL (voice over)

Ohhh !... What are the lights...

LARRY (voice over)

Oh, Jesus.

CAROL

Larry, the lights !

LARRY

Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?

CAROL

My God. This gave me the chills, honey.

LARRY

Yeah, well, let's call the police.

CAROL

I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now.

Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.

LARRY

Check it out ?

CAROL

Yes.

LARRY

What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.

CAROL

No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights

going on, there.

LARRY

Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't

we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can

check it out while we're home in the... ?

CAROL

Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case,

honey.

LARRY

What do you mean, it's your case ?

CAROL

Yes, it's my case.

LARRY

Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.

CAROL

No, come on.

LARRY

No.

CAROL

Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.

LARRY

Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.

CAROL

Ted... Oh, God.

LARRY

I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.

CAROL

Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like

to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?

HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

You were here before.

CAROL

Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.

HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

You are Police ?

CAROL

Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.

LARRY

My what ?

CAROL

Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.

LARRY

Yeah, I-I...

CAROL

Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.

CAROL

Yeah. See ?

HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

Okay.

CAROL

Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.

HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

Is there any trouble ?

LARRY

No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju...

um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height

requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re,

they're...

CAROL

Come on.

LARRY

...expensive.

CAROL

Okay.

LARRY

Be careful.

CAROL

Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything.

Okay, Larry ?

LARRY

I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just

gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a

trial, we can get trapped.

CAROL

All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in

this closet, right ?

LARRY

I don't like this.

CAROL

Right, and then he must have...

LARRY

Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've

got to be in temple.

CAROL

Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really

fast. What ?

LARRY

Shhh !...

CLEANING LADY

Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What...

LARRY

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's-

It's-It's a...

CAROL

Oh, hi.

LARRY

You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And

no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.

LARRY

Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the

towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...

CAROL

Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.

LARRY

Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're

gonna get in trouble.

CAROL

Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a

little bit.

LARRY

Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued.

CAROL (voice over)

Oh ! Larry !

LARRY

That's what ?

CAROL

Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.

LARRY

How do you know ?

CAROL

How do I know ? I saw it on her.

LARRY

You did ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

Jesus.

CAROL

I think so.

LARRY

So much for the police combing every inch of this place.

Where did you find it ?

CAROL

I found it behind the door, right there.

LARRY

Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the

ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.

CAROL

Okay. Okay.

CAROL

Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they

probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no

body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a

minute. Why would they bother with us ?

LARRY

I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.

CAROL

Just...

LARRY

We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know

what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's

involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This

could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission,

or something. I don't like it.

CAROL

Oh, not the Warren Commission.

CAROL

Oh, my God !

LARRY

Jesus ! What is that ?

CAROL

Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The-

the elevator's probably stuck.

LARRY

Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?

CAROL

Relax now, Larry.

LARRY

Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned

claustrophobic.

CAROL

It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.

LARRY

Stop. Hit something.

CAROL

I am hitting it.

LARRY

I don't like this, I don't, I don't...

CAROL

I know, I know. It's okay.

LARRY

It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.

CAROL

The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator.

Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ?

Don't panic, all right ?

LARRY

I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...

CAROL

Now, just don't worry.

LARRY

I'm just going to say the rosary, now.

CAROL

Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll

find us here. Hello !

LARRY

Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.

CAROL

Hello !

LARRY

Say something. Stop it.

CAROL

Hallo ! Hallo !

LARRY

I don't like this.

CAROL

Oh, God, look just...

LARRY

I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a

stallion.

CAROL

Yes, it's...

LARRY

I'm a stallion.

CAROL

Shh. Shut up, Larry.

LARRY

There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.

CAROL

Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're

gonna be o...

LARRY

I see grass. I see dirt.

CAROL

Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !

LARRY

You know, you said, you said, Act as a policeman.

CAROL

I know, yeah.

LARRY

I said No. You said Pretend to be a policeman. You said

Show him your card. I said What card.

CAROL

Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry,

boost me up.

LARRY

You know, I ca...

CAROL

Boost me up, and we'll get out there. We're gonna do it.

LARRY

I can't get through those things.

CAROL

Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.

LARRY

It'll never open, they're painted shut.

CAROL

No, wait. No, Larry.

LARRY

They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never

open.

CAROL

Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put

your hand together.

LARRY

I'm breathing.

CAROL

No, no, it's okay.

LARRY

I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

CAROL

Larry !

LARRY

I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

CAROL

Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen

that, okay.

LARRY

I'm fainting because the-there's...

CAROL

All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together.

Now give me a boost, okay ?

LARRY

Oh, Jesus !

CAROL

All right, you ready ?

CAROL

Wait a second ! Wait, wait !

LARRY

Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.

CAROL

Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !

LARRY

Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst

part of it is, I'm driving a used car.

CAROL

Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.

LARRY

I'm scared.

CAROL

Oh, my God !

LARRY

Oh, my God. It's her.

CAROL

So that's where he hid her.

LARRY

Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a

neurotic's jackpot.

CAROL

Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.

LARRY

We're going down.

CAROL

Oh, God. What's happening ?

LARRY

We're going down.

CAROL

Oh, God, press up ! Press up !

LARRY

Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.

CAROL

We must be heading for the basement, Larry.

LARRY

The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm

returning shoes. It's dark in here.

CAROL

What ? What are you doing ?

LARRY

Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't

care.

CAROL

I don't know where... Larry.

LARRY

I-I can't see anything.

CAROL

There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you

doing ?

CAROL

Hey, what are you doing with matches ?

LARRY

Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...

CAROL

Wait a minute, what... When were you at the Cafe des

Artistes ?

LARRY

Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress.

At-at the... At...

CAROL

At the Cafe des Artistes ?

LARRY

Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.

CAROL

Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !

LARRY

Jesus.

CAROL

Try this way.

LARRY

I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.

You know, where you can...

CAROL

Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.

LARRY

What ? What ?

CAROL

What's this ?

LARRY

I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here,

it's dank.

CAROL

All right.

LARRY

And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I

don't know. This...

LARRY

Oh, Jesus !

CAROL

Calm down.

LARRY

Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.

CAROL

There. Turn the light on.

LARRY

This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...

CAROL

Let me see.

CAROL

Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you

gonna do ?

LARRY

Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand

back.

CAROL

Careful, now.

LARRY

Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.

CAROL

Don't hurt yourself.

LARRY

Must be one of those new doors.

CAROL

Let's try out here.

LARRY

Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.

CAROL

Oh. What's down there ?

LARRY

Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.

CAROL

Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !

CAROL

Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service

entrance.

LARRY

Well, come on.

CAROL

I'm trying.

LARRY

Come on, get it open.

CAROL

I got it. I got it.

LARRY

Go into a trot.

CAROL

Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?

LARRY

What ?

CAROL

It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.

LARRY

Jesus.

CAROL

I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.

LARRY

Yes.

CAROL

Right... Yeah. Come on.

LARRY

It is. Oh, brother.

LARRY (voice over)

Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come

on.

LARRY (voice over)

No, no, no, no.

CAROL (voice over)

Yeah, no. Come on.

LARRY

I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna

follow him.

CAROL

No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.

LARRY

I know, I saw that there was a...

CAROL

Larry !

LARRY

I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it.

CAROL

Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !

LARRY

It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.

CAROL

There ! Oh !

LARRY

And a rented body.

CAROL

Hurry up. Come on.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following

here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase

somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you

know, I'll-I'll-I'll wind up hitting a school bus or

something.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Look, it's nighttime. There's no school buses at night-

time.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Don't tell me that. What about night school ?

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

You have no sense of direction. I was...

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Well, not exactly. Twenty-twenty vision.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

You have no sense of direction.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Not exactly. But anyway... No, I do have a sense of

direction. He came right here.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Where the hell are we ? What is this ?

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

I-I don't know why here.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

I don't know, but...

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

There it is !

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

What ?

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

There's his car. Right there.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

How do you know it's his car ?

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

That's his car.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Oh, it is his car.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

It is his.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Yes. Yes. Yes.

CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

Well, of course.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Okay, let me turn the light off.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

Be careful, be careful, be careful.

CAROL

Look, look !

LARRY (voice over)

Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !

LARRY

Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.

CAROL

Oh, my God.

LARRY (voice over)

Good bye, Mrs. House.

LARRY

That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.

CAROL

What are we gonna do ?

LARRY

I'm gonna call the Police, now.

CAROL

Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?

LARRY

And get them...

CAROL

I mean, this guy...

LARRY

What are we...

CAROL

You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack

two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.

LARRY

Ohhh !...

CAROL

What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...

CAROL

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

PAUL

Hallo, there.

CAROL

Hey.

PAUL

How are you ?

CAROL

H-How are you ?

PAUL

May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ?

CAROL

Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you.

PAUL

This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors.

CAROL

Yes.

GLADYS

Nice to see you.

PAUL

We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful.

GLADYS

Such a sad story.

CAROL

Yeah, it is. We, you know...

LARRY

She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.

CAROL

Yeah.

PAUL

Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on

my trip.

CAROL

Love to.

PAUL

See you later.

CAROL

See you later.

PAUL

Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an

apartment, I think I may be moving.

CAROL

Oh, well, it...

PAUL

See you later. Come on, Gladys.

CAROL

What a shame.

PAUL

Good night.

CAROL

Good night.

LARRY

Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's

got to be that either he's a...

CAROL

What ?

LARRY

Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.

CAROL

He... He...

LARRY

Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm

a twin.

LARRY

Because I don't know what's going on.

CAROL

You're nuts.

LARRY

You know, look.

CAROL

Wait, wait, yeah.

LARRY

Let me be logical about this.

CAROL

Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin.

LARRY

Hey.

CAROL

What are you talking about, Larry ?

LARRY

Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.

CAROL

I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a

twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are

you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.

LARRY

Yeah, I'm going to be logical.

CAROL

All right, all right.

LARRY

The, um, the first thing is this.

FLASHBACK SCENE

LARRY (voice over)

We came home that night. There had been a heart attack.

LARRY (voice over)

Uh, what if they induced it ? You know, some kind of

poison. We never saw the body.

LARRY (voice over)

You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some-

some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark

resemblance to Mrs. House.

LARRY (voice over)

The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know.

Mrs. House could have been hiding.

LARRY

But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night.

That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.

CAROL

Yeah. Yeah. Well...

LARRY

I can't sleep. I just, I...

CAROL

No, wait a minute, wait.

LARRY

I'm too, you know... I'm too...

CAROL

But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because

suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all

about ?

LARRY

Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey...

and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something

to eat, and talk with them.

CAROL

Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking

about ? You mean... You wanna...

LARRY

Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was

taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be

there.

CAROL

All the way out to New Jersey...

LARRY

So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that

never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That,

plus I don't know where Duluth is.

LARRY

Lucky me.

TED

Uh, you really saw his face ?

CAROL

Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...

TED

You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You

know exactly who it is.

LARRY

Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There

was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him

because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that

you could avoid it. He was right there.

MARCIA

To me, it's obvious.

LARRY

Wh... How do you see it ?

TED

How obvious ? What do you mean ?

MARCIA

Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.

LARRY

What do you mean ?

TED

What ? How ? What do you mean ?

MARCIA

Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who

bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.

TED

Yeah.

LARRY

That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term

ballpark resemblance myself.

CAROL

I know. You used the term, right.

LARRY

It was my idea. I said what she said.

MARCIA

They're with this woman.

TED

Yeah.

FLASHBACK SCENE

MARCIA (voice over)

Maybe having dinner. They don't induce a heart attack,

because that's fiction bullshit.

MARCIA (voice over)

She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously.

They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she

was dead.

TED (voice over)

Why ?

MARCIA (voice over)

I don't know. Maybe they stood to gain if she died. They

see a golden opportunity.

MARCIA (voice over)

Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides.

LARRY (voice over)

This is my theory. Exactly my theory.

MARCIA (voice over)

That's right. She checks into a hotel.

CAROL

Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the

actual spontaneous heart attack.

MARCIA

Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with

this pretty young woman.

TED

Yeah.

LARRY

Yeah.

MARCIA

He's cheating on his wife.

TED

Yeah.

MARCIA

So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he

double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the

profits.

TED

Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too,

huh ?

MARCIA

Yeah, a good chance she's aware.

CAROL

Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to

the movies.

MARCIA

She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his

wife. She said he was at work all day.

LARRY

That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.

TED

Wait, why... Why would she...

MARCIA

She's a colleague who maybe loves him.

TED

Oh, wait, wait. He's cheating on her, too.

LARRY

Cheating on two women ?

TED

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's perfect. Just, it all fits.

LARRY

The guy doesn't look the part.

MARCIA

The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder.

There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the

paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free.

TED

Oh, my... Oh, where did you find this woman ? She's a

genius.

LARRY

She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows

that we know, so if he knows we're on him.

MARCIA

Well, he doesn't care. Why should he ? Everything's been

neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his

mistress, know the truth.

CAROL

Well, j...

LARRY

She's right, there's no body.

CAROL

Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all

true. This is just a theory.

LARRY

Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying

attention ? This is a great theory.

TED

Oh, yeah. It sounds good, it holds water. Everything fits

together in this.

CAROL

I am paying attention.

LARRY

I think it's great.

MARCIA

When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to

trap him.

LARRY

Oh, excuse me.

TED

Where-Where did you find her ? She's-She's-She's really

something.

LARRY

Her mind, it just goes.

TED

Yeah, she's got one idea after another. It's like one thing

leads to another.

LARRY

Fantastic.

CAROL

I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.

TED

Oh, I thought we just had a nice first date. That's...

LARRY (voice over)

I knew that they would hit it off.

CAROL

Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him.

LARRY (voice over)

I-I-I knew this.

CAROL

Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her

lap. I saw you, Larry.

LARRY

What are you talking about ?

CAROL

Huh ?

LARRY

I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm-

I'm a father figure to her, how...

CAROL

Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands

together. That was it.

LARRY

You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're

jealous of Marcia ?

CAROL

I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.

TED

Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here?

CAROL

Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring

into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.

LARRY

What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's

interested in her.

TED

I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are

you...

CAROL

Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your

authors to lunch at the Cafe des...

MARCIA

Okay, I've got it.

MARCIA

Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we

can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no

case.

TED

What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he

slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What-

What do you mean ?

MARCIA

Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto

him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the

body ?

LARRY

You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of

that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a

shoulder, maybe, at most.

MARCIA

Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he

know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid.

MARCIA (voice over)

He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then

somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now,

you can send him to the chair.

CAROL

Okay, okay, just...

TED

I like this woman, she's lurid.

CAROL

Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?

LARRY

Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie

without giggling, so-so...

CAROL

Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ?

Why not go straight to the Police ?

MARCIA

If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.

TED (voice over)

Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this

works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ?

TED

I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail.

What have you got ? You haven't got anything.

LARRY (voice over)

Right.

TED

But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it,

now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ?

CAROL

Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in

this, I can't even count them.

TED (voice over)

What ? Name one.

CAROL (voice over)

Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and

says, What body? What the hell are you talking about ?

Prove it.

MARCIA

Well, that's when we keep bluffing.

TED (voice over)

What ? How ? What do we do ?

MARCIA

We produce the body.

LARRY

Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?

MARCIA

Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story.

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, really. J-Just...

MARCIA

Someone he trusted.

CAROL

Like who ?

MARCIA (voice over)

Like his lover. Say she called and said, Paul, I've just

seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars

for it.

TED

Why-Why would she do that ?

MARCIA (to Larry)

Remember that book you recommended to me ? Murder in

Manhattan ?

LARRY

Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone

call.

CAROL (voice over)

I don't remember that book.

LARRY

This is perfect.

CAROL (voice over)

You never mentioned that book to me.

LARRY

No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...

CAROL

Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?

TED

I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ?

LARRY

This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect

because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be

actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use

his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your

theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.

CAROL

Oh, God.

TED

Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking

about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ?

LARRY

Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake

audition, and you write some lines that don't mean

anything.

TED (voice over)

Yeah.

LARRY

And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing

and we tape-record it.

CAROL (voice over)

Uh...

LARRY

Listen to this.

CAROL (voice over)

I'm listening.

LARRY

And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we

make one end of a phone call...

LARRY (voice over)

...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House.

TED

This is in the book ?

LARRY

This is perfect, list...

CAROL (voice over)

Oh, come on. No, that could never, ever work, in a million

years. You don't know what he's going to say.

CAROL

What's he gonna say ?

MARCIA

In the book, they use several tape recorders.

CAROL (voice over)

In the book ?

MARCIA

We coordinate it.

LARRY

It's coordinated.

CAROL

In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb

paperback ?

LARRY (voice over)

This is great. This is great.

CAROL

I s... No, really.

LARRY (voice over)

I like... No, it's great.

CAROL

Oh.

MARCIA

He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him

as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks.

LARRY (voice over)

It's great. What happens, is... it provokes him to kill

again. They catch him the second time.

MARCIA (voice over)

Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder.

LARRY (voice over)

You know what I'm thinking, though ?

MARCIA

What ?

LARRY

Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of

it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working

the scheme on him.

TED (voice over)

Yeah, that's all right.

CAROL (voice over)

But...

TED (voice over)

But you're not worried about that.

LARRY

Um, well, I don't know.

MARCIA

It's perfect.

LARRY

Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.

TED

No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is

incredible. This is an incredible idea.

MARCIA

It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You

shake him down.

CAROL

No, no.

MARCIA

He comes after you, we nab him.

TED

That's great. It's great. You're wonderful. I just... I'm

amazed.

MARCIA

Yeah.

CAROL

I... I just...

MARCIA

It's either that, or he walks.

CAROL

Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is...

TED

This is great.

CAROL

Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're

saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder

Larry and me.

MARCIA

Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ?

LARRY

No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm

just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with

my clergyman before we commit.

HELEN

Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for

what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.

HELEN

Let me get a pencil. Okay.

SUZANNE

Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of

this.

TED

Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne. Thank you.

MARCIA

We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right ?

TED

Yeah. Good, thank you.

LARRY

This is Helen Moss.

HELEN

Hi, there.

CAROL (voice over)

Hi, there.

MARCIA (voice over)

Hi.

HELEN

Hi.

TED

Uh, have you, uh... I know, I know you just got the

material, uh, you know, just in the... last little while,

but... uh, h-have you had a chance to-to study it ? To go

over it, a little bit ?

HELEN

Yes, yes. Uh, I have, but, um, I have just a few questions.

TED

Sure , yeah.

HELEN

Is she divorced, in this ?

TED

Uh, yes. Yes.

HELEN

Uh, recently ?

TED

Yes. Yeah. But she's, uh, very, highly emotional.

HELEN

Yeah.

TED

You know really... uh, lot of... Lot of feeling. Very

strong.

HELEN

Oh.

TED

Hm ?

HELEN

Should I just begin ?

TED

Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it.

Whenever you feel into it.

HELEN

Yeah, okay.

HELEN

Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I...

TED (voice over)

Uh, let me stop you right there.

TED (voice over)

I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out

more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna

go.

HELEN

Right, right.

HELEN

Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound

strange, don't get alarmed.

HELEN

Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on.

LARRY

I'm trying, I'm trying.

HELEN

Quickly ! Hurry !

HELEN

They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah.

They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.

HELEN

Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on

everything. A dark cloud, a pall.

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...

HELEN'S VOICE

... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now.

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...

HELEN'S VOICE

... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.

HELEN'S VOICE

A pall.

HELEN'S VOICE

Pall.

HELEN'S VOICE

Pall.

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Joe ?

HELEN'S VOICE (distorted)

Hello, Joe.

TED

It's so...

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now...

HELEN'S VOICE

... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

MARCIA (SMILING)

Perfect.

TED

That's great.

MARCIA

You did great. Great.

CAROL

Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.

MARCIA

Fantastic.

MARCIA

There she is.

TED

Where ?

MARCIA

You have to keep her busy for all afternoon.

TED

Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep

improvising, you know ?

MARCIA

Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry

actress, you're a playwright with a role.

TED

You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get

her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life.

I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole

background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here.

MARCIA

Good. We'll hook up later, okay ?

TED

All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ?

MARCIA

All right, you too.

MARILYN

Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything ?

SY

Would you stop with the guacamole ? We have to get started

with this.

LARRY

He should be back for lunch, right ?

SY

Come on, let's go.

MARILYN

Yeah. All right, let's go.

LARRY

So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right

tape in ?

SY

Yes, we do.

MARCIA

Yeah.

LARRY

All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh,

we're on speaker.

CAROL

This is so insane.

LARRY

Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.

CAROL

Oh, w...

PAUL

I have the contractor come in and nobody's here ? Now you

see if you can find...

PAUL

I'll get that. Uh, you go and call him.

GLADYS

Oh. Yes, yes, all right.

PAUL

Hallo ?

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound

strange, don't get alarmed.

PAUL

What's the problem ?

HELEN'S VOICE

They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.

PAUL

Say that again.

HELEN'S VOICE

They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.

PAUL

Exactly who has it ? How many are there ?

HELEN'S VOICE

Your neighbors. That's right. They want two hundred

thousand dollars for it.

PAUL

Where are you calling from ? There's an echo. Are you on a

speaker phone ?

HELEN'S VOICE

Hold on.

LARRY

We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?

MARCIA

Go to a different thought.

CAROL

Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.

SY

Shhh !...

HELEN'S VOICE

You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them.

PAUL

Look, we can't talk about this on the phone. Can you meet

me ?

HELEN'S VOICE (louder)

Yes! They're keeping it refrigerated.

PAUL (voice over in the speaker of the telephone)

What ? What did you say ?

HELEN'S VOICE

About two hours ago.

PAUL

Two... what ? Two hours what ?

HELEN'S VOICE

Hold on.

LARRY

Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up.

MARCIA

Okay, let's get off as quick as possible. We've done it.

SY

All right, well, do something. Do something.

MARCIA (to Larry)

Shhh !... Um, okay. Sh !...

HELEN'S VOICE

Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound

strange, don't get alarmed.

PAUL

Look, Helen, you're not making any sense. I know you're

upset, but you have to pull yourself together. Now, could

we meet ? The usual spot.

HELEN'S VOICE

Hold on.

PAUL

Helen ? Helen, you still there ? Helen ?

MARCIA

Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay.

LARRY

Somebody press something, come on.

CAROL

What ?

LARRY

You can't press some... Come on.

HELEN'S VOICE

You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay

them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.

GLADYS

What's the matter, Paul ? You look all shaken up.

PAUL

No, no. It's nothing.

GLADYS

I worry about you these days, Paul.

PAUL

I'm fine, I'm fine.

GLADYS

You're different.

PAUL

I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ?

GLADYS

You never used to pull away from me.

PAUL (getting mad)

I told you to leave me alone ! I don't want to have this

conversation all the time !

LARRY (voice over)

Great. All right. Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour

and call Mr. House from a phone booth. Where are you...

Where are you running so fast ?

CAROL

I have to go home and change.

CAROL

I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a

location for... What ?

LARRY

What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are

you so... What are you so steamed up about ?

CAROL

What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand

how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.

LARRY

What are you talking about ?

CAROL

I just don't need...

LARRY

We had just a big success in there.

CAROL

What...

LARRY

Marcia likes to read what I like to read.

CAROL

Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I

mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now

that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're

just left facing each other.

LARRY

You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook

together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and

baste a chicken with him.

CAROL

Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ?

What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd

like to know, okay ?

LARRY

Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm

her editor.

CAROL

Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our

lives.

LARRY

I reevaluated our lives.

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.

CAROL

Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my

shrink.

LARRY

Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing

wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and

a polo mallet.

CAROL

Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay,

Larry ?

LARRY

What are you talk...

CAROL

Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?

HELEN

So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything.

TED

Oh, yeah ?

HELEN

And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a

terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia

then to New Jersey, and...

TED

So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ?

Really ?

HELEN

Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and

then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests

and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic.

TED

Oh, how wonderful.

TED

Was that before or after the fourth abortion ?

HELEN

Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize.

TED

The drama prize ?

HELEN

And... Mm... hm.

TED

I don't remember the...

HELEN

Remember ? Remember ?

TED

What ?

HELEN

Out, out, damn spot ? The topless Macbeth ?

TED

Oh, yeah. Oh, for the fraternity party, yeah, yeah.

HELEN

Yeah, yeah.

TED

Topless Macbeth. I don't... How could I forget that ?

It's just...

LARRY

Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a

package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna

cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills.

Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want

to go that route.

PAUL

And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton. If you

ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as I say.

LARRY

Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't...

don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got

Carol, put her on the phone.

CAROL (CRYING)

Larry, Larry, help me ! I'm here, Larry !

LARRY

Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !

PAUL

I'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that

package I want. Now, once I have it and I'm safely gone,

you'll get your wife back. Otherwise, I'll kill her.

LARRY

Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I,

uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes,

I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In...

in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise.

I'll be there. I...

LARRY

I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.

LARRY

Where's Carol ?

PAUL

First show me Lillian's body.

LARRY

I... I got it.

PAUL

There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten

steel.

LARRY

No, no, I... I... I got...

PAUL

If you're not bluffing, where is she ?

LARRY

Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?

PAUL

Where ?

LARRY

If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?

PAUL

Where is she ?

LARRY

I got her in the trunk of my car.

PAUL

Open it. Come on, now.

LARRY

I... I got her.

PAUL

If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head.

Now, open it !

LARRY

I... I...

PAUL

Come on! Come on!

PAUL

Step back!

LARRY

No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got

her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her

ring.

PAUL

I think you're lying !

LARRY

It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.

PAUL

What is this ? What is this ?

LARRY

I could never bluff.

PAUL

What ?

LARRY

I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.

PAUL

Listen to me.

LARRY

I'm not a bluffer.

PAUL

I'm going to put a... Get a...

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to

kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor

howling idiot.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that

was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the

police before he died.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made

Grisby talk, he'd spill everything.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but

quick.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

And I was the fall guy.

ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

Why don't you try to understand ?

ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

He was mad. He had to be shot.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

And what about me ?

ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

We could have gone off together.

MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in

the end.

CAROL (voice over)

Help ! Help !

PAUL

They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us

with the sound on. Not even a gunshot.

ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

I knew I'd find you two together.

GLADYS

Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?

PAUL

Mrs. Dalton.

GLADYS

You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then,

you decided to dump me for that young model.

PAUL (voice over)

I never led you on.

GLADYS (with a very harsh voice)

It's late for excuses.

PAUL

None of you can prove anything.

ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.

ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming

at me, aren't you ?

LARRY

Carol ? Carol ? Carol ?

GLADYS

I'm aiming at you, lover.

ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

Of course, killing you is killing myself.

GLADYS

Of course, killing you is killing myself.

ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

It's the same thing.

GLADYS

But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.

LARRY

God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?

CAROL

Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !

LARRY

Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my

life. Are you all right ?

CAROL

Yes, I'm all right.

LARRY

You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say

that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh,

gee...

CAROL

We... we gotta call the police, Larry.

LARRY

Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.

CAROL

I know. Oh, God.

LARRY

Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.

CAROL

Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow !

Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus !

LARRY

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.

CAROL

Aow ! Aow !

(talking in the phone)

Hello ?

LARRY

Wife mine.

CAROL

Oh, God.

TED

God, it's... it's so complicated. I can't... Can't keep

track of it all.

MARCIA

Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time.

FLASHBACK SCENE

THE KITCHEN

MARCIA (voice over)

Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years

ago.

MARCIA (voice over)

She changed her name when she married.

MARCIA (voice over)

Her husband died. She moved back to New York recently, a

very, very rich widow... but a recluse.

MARCIA (voice over)

Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will. They have

her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over. I guessed

right there.

MARCIA (voice over)

She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they

fake it... Pretend Lillian House died. They cremate the

sister.

MARCIA (voice over)

Lillian checks into a fleabag joint... and for several

weeks she pretends to be her sister... closing her

accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money.

MARCIA (voice over)

What she didn't realize was that her husband was two-timing

her with Helen Moss, this pretty model.

MARCIA

So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't

know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So,

he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel

all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came

along and tripped him up.

TED

He had some great alibis.

MARCIA

Yeah, that woman that worked for him ?

TED

Yeah.

MARCIA

Mrs. Dalton ? She covered for him. She loved him. Not that

she dreamed he was a murderer.

TED

What do you... What do you... I want, I want to celebrate,

or something. What do you wanna do ? You wanna... Wanna go

see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to ?

MARCIA

I think they wanna be alone.

TED

Oh, yeah. Uh, okay. All right. Uh, well, you have any

plans ?

MARCIA

You're taking me to dinner, right ?

TED

Yeah, right. Absolutely. Only we can't sleep together.

MARCIA

Why not ?

TED

Not... not tonight.

MARCIA

Why not ?

TED

Well, I already slept with Helen Moss once today, and I'm

not young and active like I used to be.

MARCIA

You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you ?

LARRY

What an experience.

CAROL

Oh, really one.

LARRY

I'm... I'm still vibrating.

CAROL

I know.

LARRY

Incredible.

CAROL

Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.

LARRY

What do you mean surprisingly ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You seem shocked.

CAROL

Well...

LARRY

You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.

CAROL

Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...

LARRY

Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to

any restaurant where they serve cowards.

CAROL

I don't know.

LARRY

I... What are you laughing at ?

CAROL

You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.

LARRY

How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that

ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?

CAROL

You were jealous of Ted.

LARRY

Ted ?

CAROL

Yeah.

LARRY

You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator

shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what

do you have ?

CAROL

You.

LARRY

Right. I love that.

CAROL

I...
