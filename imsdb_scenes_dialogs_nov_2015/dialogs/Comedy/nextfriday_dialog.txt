"Next Friday" -- by Ice Cube

CRAIG (V.O.)

In the movies, when you beat up the

neighborhood bully; you suppose to live

happily ever after.  But around here;

that's when all the drama begins...

CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)

Last Friday; I got fired for the first

time.  I got high for the first time.  I

got shot at for the first time and I

kicked Debo's ass for the first time...

CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)

I was the man that night; and Debo ended

up going to jail for a couple of years.

But he told Ezal he was getting out next

Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was

gonna smoke me on the spot...

FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK:

CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)

And today is next Friday...

MR. JONES

Craig!  Craig!  Off yo' ass and on yo'

feet; this ain't the time to beat your

meat!

CRAIG (O.S.)

I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!

MR. JONES

Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta

hit the high-way!

CRAIG (V.O.)

Soon as my pops found out what Debo said

to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my

uncle and little cousin in Rancho

Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or

Debo went back to prison.  Whichever

comes first.

CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)

I feel like the biggest punk around here.

I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one

moving.

MR. JONES

Craig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that

traffic.

MR. JONES (cont'd)

I be got damn.

MR. JONES (cont'd)

Craig!  Craig!

CRAIG

(irritated)

Here I come!

MR. JONES

(still mad)

Well bring yo' ass on...

CRAIG

What's the matter?

MR. JONES

I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!

CRAIG (V.O.)

I didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at

all.  Especially my homeboy Smokey.  But

he went to rehab last week.  I know I'mma

miss him...

DEBO

Craig!  Get out the car, boy!  This the

rematch!

CRAIG

Daddy, punch it!

DEBO

You know I'mma find you!  You can run ya'

can't hide!

CRAIG

You fake ass Suge Knight!

MR. JONES

That nigga worst than them damn pit

bulldogs or something!  That's why moving

wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is

the best thing for you right now.

CRAIG

(with attitude)

Ya'll making me look like a punk.

MR. JONES

It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's

about this...

MR. JONES (cont'd)

My great, great grand daddy on my Momma

side; had a saying... 'See a fool --

leave a fool.'  Somebody else a get him.

Plus, I don't want that fool shooting at

my house trying to hit yo' ass.

CRAIG

What's that smell?

MR. JONES

Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't

smell nothing.

CRAIG

(holding his nose)

I do.

MR. JONES

What it smell like?

CRAIG

Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

CRAIG (cont'd)

What's wrong with the window?

MR. JONES

I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll

down.

CRAIG

All damn.

MR. JONES

Just hold your breath.

MR. JONES

Nice neighborhood, huh?

CRAIG

It's alright.

MR. JONES

18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass

brother hits the lotto his first time

playing.  I still can't figure that one

out.

CRAIG

Why they got to have the loudest house on

the block!

MR. JONES

Ah, son, don't be no hater.  You know

your uncle ain't got no taste.  Just

don't let him rub off on you.

CRAIG

You coming in?

MR. JONES

No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna

hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me,

Craig.  It's gonna be different living

over here.  Don't let your uncle and your

cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?

CRAIG

Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get

me in trouble no more.

DAY-DAY

Daddy, Craig is here.

CRAIG

What's crackin'?

DAY-DAY

You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.

MR. JONES

Hey, Day-Day.  Where's yo' big head

father?

DAY-DAY

There he is.

UNCLE ELROY

Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass-

whippin'?

CRAIG

Naw, it ain't like that.

UNCLE ELROY

If you see that boy again, bite off his

ear off like Mike Tyson.

CRAIG

Alright, I'll remember that.

UNCLE ELROY

You know me?  I would've shot his big

ass.

(peeking into the ear)

Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still

steppin' in dog shit every day?

MR. JONES

Make sure you look after my son out here.

Don't get him involved with none of your

bullshit, Roy.

UNCLE ELROY

Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He

in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho

Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you

just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't

that right, nephew?

MR. JONES

Craig, remember what I told you.

CRAIG

I'll remember.

UNCLE ELROY

Send Betty my love.

(to Craig)

Boy you looking good.

(grabbing his bags)

I'mma take these in the house for you,

man... and when you finish with this cat,

come inside.  I got something to show

you.

CRAIG

Thanks, Unc.

DAY-DAY

You know it's been over a year since we

kicked it last?  Up at the family

reunion.

CRAIG

I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed

out everybody, and threw up in Aunt

Faye's backseat.

DAY-DAY

Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out

everybody.  Damn that was fun.

CRAIG

I know, we had a good time.  But ever

since you guys moved out here, it seems

like we've lost touch.

DAY-DAY

I know; this a long way from Watts.  But

what I like about living out here is that

you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens,

no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace

and quiet.  Listen.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Shit sound good, huh?

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Aw damn.

CRAIG

Who is that?

DAY-DAY

Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l

Joker, he just got out of Youth

Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got

out of Juvenile Hall.

CRAIG

They ever let you hit the switches on

that Cadillac?

DAY-DAY

Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially

that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little

ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something

better than a Cadillac.

CRAIG

This you?

DAY-DAY

(proud)

Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin'

somethin' I picked up.

CRAIG

Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery.

Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.

DAY-DAY

Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying

off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end

up with a million.  We bought this house

and I spent the rest on this.  It's the

bomb, huh?

CRAIG

This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in

this car.  I get mo' phone numbers

rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.

MISS HO KYM (O.S.)

Hi, Day-Day!

DAY-DAY

(speaking louder and slower)

Hi, Mulan.

MISS HO KYM

Fuck you, Day-Day.  Who's ya boy?

DAY-DAY

This my cousin, Craig.  He just moved out

here from L.A.  Craig, this is Miss Ho.

MISS HO KYM

My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just

trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet

you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?

CRAIG

Excuse me?

MISS HO KYM

I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it --

rowdy, rowdy?

CRAIG

Yeah, I'm 'bout it.

MISS HO KYM

Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day,

something is going down with those

Mexicans across the street?  I've been

seeing a lot of activity.

CRAIG

What kind of activity?

MISS HO KYM

Strange activity.  I think they running

drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe

me.

DAY-DAY

How do you know for sure?

MISS HO KYM

I know everything, playboy.  Don't hate,

congratulate.

DAY-DAY

I don't have time, Miss Ho, I'll see you

later.

MISS HO KYM

See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after

work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.

CRAIG

Nice to meet you?

MISS HO KYM

Peace out, Craig.

CRAIG

Man, this a cool house.

DAY-DAY

(picking up a picture)

Thanks, I just wish my mother had a

chance to see it.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

But when she found out we won the money,

she had a heart attack.  You know the

story.

CRAIG

Yeah.

DAY-DAY

Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma

go get dressed for work.

CRAIG

Oh, yeah, where you work at?

DAY-DAY

Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping

center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if

he got a little position for you.  'Cause

you been unemployed for a long time now,

Craig.

CRAIG

Thanks for reminding me.

UNCLE ELROY

Craig, I want you to meet my old lady,

Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.

SUGA

Oooh, ba-by!

SUGA (cont'd)

(hugging and grabbing)

You even cuter than your baby pictures.

CRAIG

Thank you.

SUGA

(whispering in Craig's ear)

You know, I'mma be your new auntie.  We

can keep it all in the family if you want

to.

UNCLE ELROY

Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on

some damn clothes.

SUGA

(pouting)

Elroy.

UNCLE ELROY

Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to

smoke on.

SUGA

Okay.

(winking)

Bye, Craig.

CRAIG

Nice to meet you.

UNCLE ELROY

Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day.

Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going

out... she don't never get enough.  But

check this out.  I got to lay some ground

rules.

(gets closer to Craig)

Your my family and I love you.  You're

welcome to anything you want in my home.

But I don't wanna catch you in the

refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you

feel me knocking?

CRAIG

Yeah.

UNCLE ELROY

Well, let me in.

CRAIG

Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's

car?

UNCLE ELROY

Oh, that's D'Wana.  His ex.

(yelling upstairs)

Day-Day, the crazy bitch is back!

DAY-DAY

Aw, naw.

DAY-DAY

Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from

my house.  What you doing over here?

D'WANA

What it look like I'm doing?  You can't

quit me, I'm pregnant!

DAY-DAY

That ain't my baby!

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

(in disbelief)

Oh, my God!  What you doing?!

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Bitch!  You keyed my car!  I'mma kill

you!

D'WANA

I got your bitch right here.

DAY-DAY

Awwwww....

(staggering)

Awwwww....

D'WANA

I expect you to return all phone calls

and take me to lunch today.  I'll be back

out here on my break.  Nobody quits me.

DAY-DAY

I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!

CRAIG

Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.

DAY-DAY

She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper-

sprayed me!

CRAIG

I know, be still.

UNCLE ELROY

Boy, you got you a little fatal

attraction, huh?  I had two or three of

them in my day.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

Craig, I hope you know how to deal with

women better than this fool.

CRAIG

That's too much water.

UNCLE ELROY

Help him to his feet.  Let's get him to

the bathroom.

DAY-DAY

(confused)

Hold on.  What you doing?

UNCLE ELROY

Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for

about 20 minutes.

DAY-DAY

20 minutes?

UNCLE ELROY

Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been

pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

Let me show you my back yard.  You know

it's bigger than y'all back yard.

UNCLE ELROY

Yeah, you gotta have a little money to

live out here, Craig.  I never thought

I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the

suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check,

I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars

cash on this house.

CRAIG

You paid cash?

UNCLE ELROY

Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me

with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for

suckas.  They got my daddy like that for

a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only

house on the block that's paid for.

That's why I'm the king around here.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

You like that pool?

CRAIG

It's cool, but where's the water?

UNCLE ELROY

Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool

in the projects...so none of us swim.

CRAIG

Y'all never use it?

UNCLE ELROY

Never...

(humping the air)

But me and Suga can get real nasty in

that Jacuzzi, though.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

(shaking the water off the

condom)

You welcome get in it anytime you want

to.  Shit, you my brother's son.

CRAIG

That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.

UNCLE ELROY

Good.

CRACK DEALER (O.S.)

Ezal, I'm sick of you coming around here

wit no money.

EZAL

I be damned.

EZAL (cont'd)

Now look here, man.  I'mma preferred

customer and I can take my credit card

somewhere else.

EZAL (cont'd)

Oh, my neck, oh, my back.  Man, I quit!

I'm retired!  Officially!  Life shouldn't

be this hard for a crackhead!

DEBO

Where did Craig move to?

EZAL

I don't know, Debo.

DEBO

What you say?

EZAL

(hurting)

He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his

cousin Day-Day.

DEBO

Rancho Cucamonga?

EZAL

Yeah.

EZAL (cont'd)

I can't breathe.

DEBO

Get on.

EZAL

Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on

that.

DEBO

Get on!

EZAL

Just don't go over the curb.

EZAL (cont'd)

Watch my balls!

CRAIG

You straight?

DAY-DAY

Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still

orange to you?

CRAIG

Just a little.

DAY-DAY

I can't taste nothing.

CRAIG

What's the matter with your girlfriend?

DAY-DAY

Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana

three months ago.  She had a little pudge

in her stomach but I didn't pay it no

attention.  Come to find out, she six

months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!

CRAIG

What?

DAY-DAY

Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago

and she's been harassing me ever since.

She don't care about the restraining

order or nothing.

CRAIG

Restraining order?  Where the hell you

meet this girl?

DAY-DAY

I went back to Watts to sell my old car

and met her on the way.  Worst day of my

life.

CRAIG

Damn, you got a stalker.

DAY-DAY

That ain't the worst part.  Her little

sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets

real physical.  But I got a restraining

order on her, too.

CRAIG

You got a restraining order on a little

girl named Baby D?

DAY-DAY

(very serious)

You don't know Baby D.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired

like you.

KARLA

(friendly)

Hi!

BOTH

(waving back)

HEY!

CRAIG

Who is that?

DAY-DAY

That's the sister.

CRAIG

Yo know what?  I'm starting to like

Rancho Cucamonga.

DAY-DAY

I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the

same thing.  But it can't happen.

CRAIG

Why?

DAY-DAY

Because, it's been a little tension

between us ever since they got out the

joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm

just trying to keep the peace.  We moved

out here to get away from that shit.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

It ain't that bad, is it?

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Craig!  It ain't that bad, is it?

CRAIG

Yeah, it's bad.  And that scratch make it

ugly.

CRAIG (cont'd)

It's long and crooked...make you not

wanna even drive it.

DAY-DAY

Alright, alright... I see what you

talking about.

CRAIG

Hold up, Day-Day.

DAY-DAY

Let it go.

CRAIG

Hey!  Hey!

CRAIG (cont'd)

I'm Day-Day's cousin, Craig.  What's your

name?

KARLA

Karla.

CRAIG

Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty

good together.  Where you going?

KARLA

To the Cucamonga shopping center.

CRAIG

Oh yeah, why you walking?

KARLA

My brothers won't give me a ride.

DAY-DAY

(to himself)

Just get the number and come on.  Just

get the number and come on.

CRAIG

You want us to give you a ride?

KARLA

I don't know.

CRAIG

What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait

here.

CRAIG (cont'd)

What are you worried about?

DAY-DAY

Cheeco!

KARLA

Cheeco, no!

DAY-DAY

Oh shit, jump!

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Hey, Joker!  Stop playing, man!  Call the

dog back!

JOKER

Get yo dumb ass in the back.

DAY-DAY

Look at my roof.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Man, why you do that?  I told you not to

talk to that girl.

CRAIG

Why not?  She was cool with it.

DAY-DAY

So.

CRAIG

What you mean, so?

DAY-DAY

If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and

start a feud, you can always go back to

home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember

that.

UNCLE ELROY

Nephew, you got perfect timing...

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

We about to start a little puff, puff

give in this mothafucka.  Are you down?

SUGA

(patting the couch)

Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here.

UNCLE ELROY

I know you smoke weed, right?

CRAIG

Why you say that?

UNCLE ELROY

'Cause your lips is getting black.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

All I smoke is blunts.  Them fuckin'

Zigzags don't do nothing for me.

SUGA

Would you like a glass of wine, baby?

CRAIG

No thank you. It's too early.

UNCLE ELROY

Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them

bitches in Havana.  I know Willie don't

let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya

uncle.  I don't care how high you get in

my house.  Long as you let me hit it...

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

Look at that.

SUGA

Fire it up, Roy.

UNCLE ELROY

Now I'mma show you the real "Puff Daddy."

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

(still coughing)

It's the Bombay.

CRAIG

Suga.

UNCLE ELROY

Negro, what the hell you doing to my

woman?

CRAIG

(confused and dazed)

I don't know!

UNCLE ELROY

Suga!

SUGA

(face in lap)

Huh?

UNCLE ELROY

What you doing to my nephew?

SUGA

(lifting her head)

Ah, baby...I thought this was you.

(to Craig)

Craig, what are you doing to me?

CRAIG

I don't know, I think I passed out or

something.  I don't remember.

UNCLE ELROY

Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I

knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out

on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make

'em like they used to, baby.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

Come on, woman.  I'm faded and feeling X-

rated.  It's Mr. Nasty time.

SUGA

Mr. Nasty time?

UNCLE ELROY

Mr. Nasty time.

(grabbing his back)

But take it easy on me, girl.

SUGA

Craig, you ain't the only lightweight

around here.

UNCLE ELROY

Make yourself at home.

SMOKEY (V.O.)

Hi, my name is Smokey.  And I'm a bud-

head.  But here at the King/Drew Rehab

Center, they help you curve your crave

for marijuana but still let you get your

drank on.

SMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.)

It's too hard to stop everything all at

once.  So some days they let you smoke,

but not drank.  And other days you can

drank, but not smoke.  And if you're

really making progress, the nurses will

get fucked up wit you.  Helping you kick

the habit by smoking up all yo shit.  So

come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center

and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B.,

man!

UNCLE ELROY (O.S.)

Oh, baby, right there.  Right

there...bite the nipple, baby.  Bite it!

Bite it!  Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come

on, baby, get busy...

DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)

DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)

Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda

hot out here.

CRAIG

Can I help you?

DELIVERY GUY

CRAIG

DELIVERY GUY

Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a

white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type.

Remember what happen to O.J... what team

CRAIG

(in his face)

Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker

Killers.  You want tickets?

DELIVERY GUY

Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage

How can they do this?

CRAIG

I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it

or something?

ROACH

What it say?

DAY-DAY

Ever since my momma died the bills are

always late.

CRAIG

See how much it is?

ROACH

What is it?

DAY-DAY

Don't worry about it, man.  Get the

phone.

ROACH

Pinky's.

DAY-DAY

It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.

CRAIG

Damn...how much money ya'll got left from

the lottery?

DAY-DAY

$247.

CRAIG

Okay, plan B.

ROACH

That was a girl on a cell phone.  She

said she's outside in the parking lot

waiting for you to take her to lunch.

DAY-DAY

Oh my God.  That's D'Wana.  And she got

Baby'D with her.

CRAIG

What's the matter?

DAY-DAY

D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.

ROACH

That the big one, huh?

DAY-DAY

You damn right that's the big one.

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm

gone.

CRAIG

I ain't trying to get in it.

DAY-DAY

You already in.

CRAIG

No I'm not.

ROACH

I'll do it.

DAY-DAY

No.  You can't handle a girl like D'Wana.

It's got to be Craig.

D'WANA

That white boy said he was in there.

BABY'D

Day-Day, don't make me break this window!

DAY-DAY

Watch out for Baby'D.

CRAIG

Day-Day ain't here.

D'WANA

Who are you?

CRAIG

I'm his cousin.

BABY'D

You suppose to work here now or

something?

CRAIG

Yeah, I work here now.

D'WANA

We didn't come here for Day-Day.

CRAIG

Yes you did.

D'WANA

No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.

BABY'D

Now move.

D'WANA

Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was

here?

CRAIG

I don't know... I think he went out the

back.

D'WANA

Can I look for myself?

ROACH

Hey, ladies.

D'WANA

Where's Day-Day?

ROACH

I don't know, he must've left.

CRAIG

I thought ya'll wanted to buy a CD?

BABY'D

I do... can you help me find the jazz

section?

CRAIG

Right this way.  You know damn well you

don't listen to no jazz.

D'WANA

If Day-Day comes back, tell him I came by

and need to see him.  Lamaze classes are

Wednesday.

ROACH

Will do.

D'WANA

Come on, 'D, let's go.

CRAIG

Where you going?

D'WANA

Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta

pee.

ROACH

Yeah.

D'WANA

Thank you.

DAY-DAY

Shit.

D'WANA

He's in there!

BABY'D

Where is he?

D'WANA

He ran out the door.

ROACH

Haul ass, dude.  Don't stop.

CRAIG

You better stop running from that girl.

DAY-DAY

Fuuuuuuck -- U!

DAY-DAY (cont'd)

I'mma shoot yo' big ass.

ROACH

(smiling)

She moves well for a big girl.

KARLA

Hello, remember me?

CRAIG

Hell yeah, I remember you.

KARLA

I'm sorry for what my brother did this

morning.  They're assholes.

CRAIG

It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize

for your brothers.  They're big boys.

KARLA

I just wanted to give you this.

KARLA (cont'd)

If my brothers wasn't so over-protective,

I'd have you call the house.  But for now

just page me when you get a chance.

CRAIG

Most definitely.

KARLA

Better sooner than later.

DAY-DAY

Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as

usual.  So what can we do to end it this

time?  What you want?  Another Big Pun

CD?  'Cause I gotta get back to work.

BABY'D

Okay, I know what I want this time.

DAY-DAY

Anything you need.

BABY'D

Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.

DAY-DAY

That's it?

BABY'D

Just tell him to come over here and talk

to me.

DAY-DAY

And I can go free?

BABY'D

Go, fo' I change my mind.

ROACH

Great moves, Day-Day.

CRAIG

What happen?

DAY-DAY

We worked out a deal.  All you gotta do

is go over there and talk to Baby'D.

CRAIG

What you mean talk to her?

ROACH

(still smiling)

You know what he mean, dude.

CRAIG

I'm gone.

BABY'D

I'mma get you, Day-Day!  You gotta come

out sometimes!

D'WANA

I told you.

DAY-DAY

What was that?

ROACH

(looking out window)

You don't wanna know.

DAY-DAY

Thanks a lot, Craig.

CRAIG

I know we cousins and all, but don't try

an' hook me up with the big little

sisters.

DAY-DAY

Big bitches need love, too, Craig.

ROACH

For sure.  That's how I like 'em.

CRAIG

Not me.

DAY-DAY

Are they still out there?

ROACH

Negative...they vamped.

ROACH (cont'd)

Shouldn't we straighten up out here

before Pinky gets back?

CRAIG

Day-Day?

DAY-DAY

Today ain't my day.

ROACH

Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be

a kick-ass day.

CRAIG

Yeah it is...the best day before the

weekend.

ROACH

That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.

ROACH (cont'd)

I know how you feeling.  And if I had my

bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til

you choke.'  Dude, right here.  All out.

No lungs.  All I got is this.

CRAIG

What's the green stuff poking out?

ROACH

That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for

me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies.

Wanna bite?

CRAIG

Naw, I already ate.

ROACH

Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.

CRAIG

It ain't a bong but, wa-la!

ROACH

Wo!

CRAIG

Hey.

ROACH

Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do

that?

CRAIG

Black magic.

DAY-DAY

Give me dat.  I'm the one with the

problem.

ROACH

Weed doesn't solve problems.  It eases

the mind, and the soul.  Enjoy.

CRAIG

I didn't think you smoked bud that much.

DAY-DAY

(letting out the smoke)

I don't.

ROACH

(taking the joint)

I do.

DAY-DAY

Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I

didn't even pass it.

ROACH

(hitting it good)

Sorry, dude.

CRAIG

You better open up a window or something

before the smell gets out.

DAY-DAY

Ain't no windows in here.

ROACH

I got an idea.

ROACH (cont'd)

This is a little theory of mine... it

should work.

DAY-DAY

Blow.

CRAIG

That ain't gonna work.

ROACH

Fuck yeah.

DAY-DAY

(passing the 'J)

It works.

CRAIG

Still gonna smell it.

ROACH

No way.  Watch this.

PINKY

Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn

corners too fast.  Slow down.  I almost

spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar

suit.

PINKY (cont'd)

I be damn.

DAY-DAY

Roach, what are you doing?

ROACH

R-U-S-H Intensely.

ROACH (cont'd)

My spleen.

CRAIG

(unplugging the vacuum)

This vacuum don't work.  Where's the

restroom?

DAY-DAY

Out the door and to the left.

ROACH

I thought the vacuum would work.

PINKY

(whispering)

Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth

off.

PINKY (cont'd)

Now back up slowly... and don't say a

word.

PINKY (cont'd)

Get on the floor.

PINKY (cont'd)

Little mothafucka trying to rob me.

I'mma show you how I do 'em.

CRAIG

I ain't trying to rob you...

PINKY

Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo'

ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and

Roach?

CRAIG

Man, Day-Day is my people!

PINKY

I said shut up!  Now who sent you?

CRAIG

Nobody!

PINKY

If you say another word, it's over.  I'm

not playing!

PINKY (cont'd)

You ain't got no gun, but where's the

weed at?  I smell it.

PINKY (cont'd)

I'mma tie you ass up!

DAY-DAY

I gotta think of a plan to get this money

before tomorrow.

ROACH

You could sell your Beamer.

ROACH (cont'd)

My bad.

DAY-DAY

I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good

idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes

out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky

gets here.

ROACH

Maybe you can ask him to loan you the

money.

DAY-DAY

Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I

think you are, Roach.

ROACH

I know.

PINKY

Don't kill me.

CRAIG

Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass

that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're

right there in the back.

PINKY

Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see

shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27.

Just take it all.

DAY-DAY

Craig, what the hell are you doing?

CRAIG

Nothing.

PINKY

Day-Day, is this your cousin?

DAY-DAY

Yeah.

PINKY

Good.  You fired...and, Roach, your fired

too.

ROACH

Why me?

PINKY

I smell weed.

PINKY (cont'd)

And you...you lucky.  I was just about to

get in yo' ass.  Now give me my pistol

back and get the hell out my store.

MR. JONES

Just hold on, Craig.  I'm on my way.

EZAL

Debo!  Debo!

DEBO

What?

EZAL

I can't feel my legs no more.

DEBO

Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?

EZAL

I don't know.

CRAIG (V.O.)

In a strange way, I feel responsible for

Day-Day getting fired.  If I wouldn't

have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the

joint, he'd still have a job.

UNCLE ELROY

Ah damn.  Damn.

DAY-DAY

I got fired too.

UNCLE ELROY

What?!

MR. JONES

Damn.

MR. JONES (cont'd)

Say, man, hurry up.  We got an emergency

out here.

MR. JONES (cont'd)

I knew I shouldn't have ordered that

extra hot sauce.

DAY-DAY

Man, sit down.

MR. JONES

Say, man, what the hell you doing in

there?  Open the door.

MICHAEL JORDAN

Don't nobody go in the bathroom for about

35, 40 minutes.

MR. JONES

Hey, you that boy?

MR. JONES (cont'd)

(smiling)

Ain't that something, Michael Jordan.

MR. JONES (cont'd)

Oh, Michael, that boy better check his

drawls.

DAY-DAY

What we gonna do?

CRAIG

I don't know yet.

ROACH

I know what I'mma do.  Go home and face

the music.  My dad is gonna kick my ass

for getting fired again.

DAY-DAY

Alright, Roach, see you around.

CRAIG

Sorry about today, man.

ROACH

Yeah, me too.  Later.

DAY-DAY

Man, sit down.  I can't think with you

falling everywhere.

ROACH

My board!

JOKER

What the fuck you looking at?

DAY-DAY

Nothing.

ROACH

You ran over my board!

JOKER

So what?  It shouldn't have been in the

street.

ROACH

Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?

DAY-DAY

Let it go, Roach, trust me.

ROACH

I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed

my board.

DAY-DAY

Let it go!

CRAIG

Wait.  Check'em out.

BABY JOKER

Get down.

CRAIG

You see that?

DAY-DAY

I didn't see nothing.

ROACH

Me neither.

CRAIG

It's something in that hydraulic pump.

DAY-DAY

Yeah, air.

CRAIG

Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better

than air.

DAY-DAY

How you know?  It could be anything.

CRAIG

I don't know, and it could be anything.

But I just say we go take a look.

ROACH

I say we go over there and kick their

asses.  I can take the little one.

DAY-DAY

Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing

with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.

CRAIG

Could be.  Rather be crazy than homeless.

Now all we need is a big pack of baloney.

BOTH

Baloney??

KARLA

I thought you were taking me to see Mama?

JOKER

I'll take you later.

KARLA

When?  After you get all drunk and

loaded?

JOKER

Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass

later.  Now get out of here.  You're

scaring our company.

JOKER (cont'd)

Get up.

JOKER (cont'd)

Take it in the room.

GIRL #1

What was that?

LI'L JOKER

What was what?

GIRL #1

That silver thing.

LI'L JOKER

I didn't see no silver thing, and neither

did you.

DAY-DAY

This ain't gonna work.  I'm going back.

CRAIG

It's about to work, just come on.

ROACH

(about to bite baloney)

What about the dog?

CRAIG

That's what the baloney's for!

DAY-DAY

Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig.

I got the B-G's.

CRAIG

What's the B-G's?

DAY-DAY

(holding his stomach)

The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels

like I'mma shit on myself.

ROACH

Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass

cheeks together.

DAY-DAY

Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go

home.

CRAIG

Look, Day-Day.  If we don't go over there

and take a look, this might be the last

night you got a home.  Now trust me.

CRAIG (cont'd)

Now all we gotta do is find out where the

little one put that pump.  Take it and

see what's in it.

DAY-DAY

You make it sound so easy.

CRAIG

It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're

not expecting it.

Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco.

Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a

good look.

ROACH

Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why.

Me and K-9's just don't get along.

CRAIG

Well get along with this one.

(pushing Roach)

Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't

let that mutt out of your sight.

ROACH

Fuck, what's his name?

CRAIG

Cheeco.

ROACH

(nervous whisper)

Here, Cheeco.  Chee-co, here boy.  That's

a good boy.

CRAIG

Come on, he should have'em by now.

DAY-DAY

Hurry up.  He didn't have that much

baloney.

LI'L JOKER

(yelling towards bedroom)

Hey, homes, you guys better hurry up!

I'mma get greedy.

DAY-DAY

(to himself)

Look at those tig-ole-bitties

CRAIG

You go first.

DAY-DAY

Naw, you go first.

CRAIG

You go first.

DAY-DAY

No.

CRAIG

Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence

I'mma throw you over.

DAY-DAY

I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little

no more.

CRAIG

What?

DAY-DAY

I hope to God that dog is happy.

CRAIG

Me too.

ROACH

My baloney has a first name.  It's C-h-e-

e-c-o.

ROACH (cont'd)

My baloney has a second name it just like

the first Cheeco.

ROACH (cont'd)

Ooooohhhh I love to eat it everyday if

you ask me what I'll say.

ROACH (cont'd)

Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin'

mutt in the whole wide U.S.A.

CRAIG

Wait.

DAY-DAY

(loud whisper)

Wait for what?

CRAIG

He's still over by Roach.

BABY JOKER

Want me to take a look?

JOKER

No, keep working.

LI'L JOKER

Yo, man fuck that shit.  Do it later.

It's Friday, time to party, SA.

JOKER

Close the door.

LI'L JOKER

Not until you come party with us, man.

JOKER

Alright, put it in that drawer.

DAY-DAY

(whispering)

What you see?

CRAIG

That pump was full of money.  I saw where

they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma

climb in and go get it.

DAY-DAY

Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass

off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.

CRAIG

No, man, just wait.

DAY-DAY

I got the B-G's.

ROACH

Good boy.  Nice dog.

ROACH

No lungs, baby.  No lungs.

GIRL #2

No.

JOKER

Fuck that.

JOKER (cont'd)

Who locked this door?

JOKER (cont'd)

Who locked this fuckin' door?!

JOKER

I don't want no doors locked around here.

You hear me?

GIRL #2

Oh, poppy, I like it rough.

JOKER

(taking off shirt)

Good, 'cause that's how you gonna get it.

LI'L JOKER

Karla!

KARLA

What are you doing?

CRAIG

Huh?

KARLA

What are you doing here?

CRAIG

I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I

just had to come in here and show you I

ain't scared of yo' punk ass

brothers...and you wouldn't have be

scared of 'em neither if you had a man

like me in yo' life.

KARLA

What??  So you snuck in my room to tell

me that?

CRAIG

Yes I did.  Excuse me.

LI'L JOKER

Who you talking to?

KARLA

Nobody.

LI'L JOKER

I heard a voice.

KARLA

No you didn't.  Get out my room.  Go back

down to your little girlfriends.

GIRL #2 (O.S.)

Shut the window.

JOKER (O.S.)

You shut the window.

DAY-DAY

Oh shit.

ROACH

...like I was saying.  A guy like me, and

a dog like you, don't need this bullshit.

We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to

fat funks in flower shirts.  You feel me,

C?

DAY-DAY

Roach...Roach, come on.

ROACH

Where's Craig?

DAY-DAY

He's inside the house?

ROACH

Why did he go in the house?

DAY-DAY

Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure

out a way to get Craig out of there.

He's probably getting tied up now.

KARLA

You did all this for me?

CRAIG

Most of it.  I just hate to see you in

this situation.

KARLA

Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be

peaceful before they got out.  Took over

the house and caused my mother's nervous

breakdown.

CRAIG

Why didn't she put'em out?

KARLA

Easier said than done.  We saved up to

get away from them, but they followed us.

CRAIG

I'm sorry to hear that.

CRAIG (cont'd)

Can I get out this way?

KARLA

I thought you came up here to see me.

CRAIG

I did.  Is that door locked?

KARLA

It's locked.

CRAIG

Make sure.

KARLA

You so nervous, I already locked this

door.

KARLA (cont'd)

See.  All locked.

KARLA (cont'd)

What's your hurry?

CRAIG

I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.

KARLA

(getting even closer)

So what?  Let's make'em wait.

CRAIG

I be damn.

DAY-DAY

You wanna knock?

ROACH

Go for it.

ROACH (cont'd)

No one's gonna hear that.  The music's

playing.

DAY-DAY

'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto

knock.

ROACH

This is a knock.

JOKER

You fuckin' lover boys hear that?

BABY JOKER

Hear what?

JOKER

Don't fuckin' move.

DAY-DAY

What's wrong with you, fool.  Stop

kicking their door.  They might think we

the police.

JOKER

What the fuck you want?

DAY-DAY

Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup

of sugar?

JOKER

What?!  This look like a 7-11 or

something?  Get the fuck outta here!

DAY-DAY

(starts to leave)

Alright, no problem.  We gone.

ROACH

Hold on.  A man, you broke my fuckin'

board and I don't appreciate it.

MR. JONES

I got your message.  Where's Craig?

UNCLE ELROY

I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn

message!

MR. JONES

You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a

urgent message?

UNCLE ELROY

Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics

must be sucking on yo' brain!

MR. JONES

Somebody left me a message.  Well where's

Craig and Day-Day?

UNCLE ELROY

I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym

if she seen them.

KARLA

Next time, page me first.

CRAIG

Okay.

KARLA

You alright?

CRAIG

Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.

CRAIG (cont'd)

What is he doing here?

DAY-DAY

Look, man, this is a big

misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is

borrow some sugar.

ROACH

And some rolling papers.

DAY-DAY

...and some rolling papers, that's it.

We didn't mean to mess up y'all get

together or nothing.

(to the Girls)

How y'all doing?

GIRLS

Fine.

DAY-DAY

That's good.  My name's Day-Day and this

is my friend, Roach.

ROACH

(waving)

Hey.

DAY-DAY

Ya'll live around here?

JOKER

Shut up!  Both of you right now!

DAY-DAY

(to Roach)

Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.

JOKER

I don't believe this sugar shit.

Something ain't right.

JOKER (cont'd)

(in Spanish)

Go check on the money.

LI'L JOKER

Here comes Karla, put the guns away.

JOKER

Keep your mouth shut.

KARLA

Hey, what's going on?

JOKER

Nothing.  What you want?

KARLA

Are you going to take me to see Mom?

JOKER

Take your car.

KARLA

'Take your car?'

JOKER

Yeah, and hurry up.

KARLA

Okay.

KARLA (cont'd)

I'll be back in a bit.  'Bye.

JOKER

If everything's alright.  We might let

you leave, too.

UNCLE ELROY

Craig, where the hell you been?

MR. JONES

Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig,

what the hell wrong with you?  Where you

been?

CRAIG

Have you seen Day-Day?

UNCLE ELROY

No.  Thought he was with you.

CRAIG

Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.

BABY JOKER

(in Spanish)

Some of the money is missing.

JOKER

(upset)

What?!?!

DAY-DAY

What?!

(as he looks at Roach)

What that mean?

ROACH

I don't know.

JOKER

It means you Miyateas are staying with

us.

(to Baby Joker)

Get the duct tape.

(to Li'l Joker)

You know what to do.

LI'L JOKER

Put your clothes back on.

LI'L JOKER

Sorry you gotta walk, but I'll call you

tomorrow.

CRAIG

You see that?

MR. JONES

I saw it.

UNCLE ELROY

Me, too.  You think they're in there?

CRAIG

Yup.

MISS HO KYM

Why for?  Them boys are real player

haters.

CRAIG

It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do

somethin'.

MR. JONES

You come way out here to get into more

trouble.  You could've stayed at home.

UNCLE ELROY

Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get

in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.

MR. JONES

(rolling up his sleeve)

Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't

lost none of my street skills.

SUGA

If ya'll don't come back not in ten

minutes, I'mma callin' the po'lice.

UNCLE ELROY

Wait a minute.  I gotta go get my shit.

DAY-DAY & ROACH

'Why can't we be friends?  Why can't we

be friends?  Why can't we be friends?

Why can't we be friends?'...

DAY-DAY

(still singing)

'I hope my cousin call the C.I.A.'

JOKER

Shut the fuck up!

JOKER (cont'd)

If you don't tell me where my money is,

I'mma show you how close we can get.

DAY-DAY

Money?  Man, we came over here from some

sugar and rolling papers.  We was going

to get high, and I was going to show this

white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's

all.

ROACH

Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro.

It's Friday.

JOKER

I'm hearing a lot of talking, but I'm not

hearing the right words.

BABY JOKER

Maybe the other guy took it.

DAY-DAY

Why would he take it?  He don't even know

you.

JOKER

(thinking)

Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?

CRAIG

That's a nice piece of heat right there.

UNCLE ELROY

Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the

mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.

MR. JONES

Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed.

Back in the day, all I had was a stick.

CRAIG

Come on.

UNCLE ELROY

What about that ugly dog?

MR. JONES

I got my mase.

CRAIG

He's on the other side, sleep.

CRAIG (cont'd)

Need some help?

MR. JONES

Need to lose some weight.

UNCLE ELROY

Shut yo' ass up.

UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)

Damn.

CRAIG

I'm not sure, but I think they're in this

room.

JOKER

Tape his mouth shut.

DAY-DAY

Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot

for this community.  By letting us go,

you can improve black and brown

relations.

ROACH

Yeah, brown and white relations, too.

DAY-DAY

Boy, you gonna get us killed.

JOKER
