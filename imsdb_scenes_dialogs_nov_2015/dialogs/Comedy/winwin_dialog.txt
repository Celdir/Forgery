ABBY

(WHISPERS)

Mommy, can we play croquet today?

ABBY (CONT'D)

Where's Daddy?

JACKIE

He's running.

ABBY

From what?

MIKE

OK. OK. Hi there.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 2

JACKIE

Shit.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

How was the run?

MIKE JACKIE

JACKIE (CONT'D)

(TO MIKE)

I'm very impressed with you keeping

it up.

ABBY

I don't like it.

JACKIE

You do too, so stop drawing and

eat.

MIKE ABBY

JACKIE (CONT'D)

They're all the same.

MIKE

That's my team? That's great,

honey. Are they winning?

ABBY

Yeah.

JACKIE

Maybe you should show the team.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 3

CONTINUED:

ABBY

Shit.

JACKIE

Honey, you can't use that word.

It's a bad word.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

What? Don't look at me.

MIKE

Uh huh. Bye sweetie.

ABBY MIKE

JACKIE

Hey. You OK?

MIKE

Yeah.

JACKIE

You sure?

MIKE

Yeah. I'm good. Why?

JACKIE

Just checking.

MIKE

OK. Bye guy's.

ABBY

Can I have more juice?

JACKIE

Just a minute.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 4

JACKIE

Mike?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Did you call Fenn about the tree?

PAUL

No. I will today.

JACKIE

Please do. I don't want it coming

down on the house.

MIKE

Yeah. You're right. I will.

JACKIE

Mike?

MIKE

Yeah?

JACKIE

I love you.

MIKE

I love you too, sweetie. Bye.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Shit.

MIKE

Vig?

VOICE

Down here.

MIKE

What's up, Vig?

VIGMAN

Donna's out sick and can't find

anything without her. It sucks.

MIKE

Who was that guy?

VIGMAN

Oh, that sucks more. He's the

plumber. I called him to look at

that piece of crap of boiler.

MIKE

Why?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 6

CONTINUED:

VIGMAN

That clanking is driving me nuts.

Can't you hear it down in your

office?

MIKE

Yeah. I just figured it's old.

VIGMAN

Well it is but he took one look at

it and said we should replace it

before it blows.

MIKE

What?! We just had it fixed three

months ago.

VIGMAN

Yeah, he said that job was crap.

The guy did crap work. Can you

believe that? That little scumbag!

MIKE VIGMAN

getting paid. Makes me sick.

No one wants to do the work

anymore.

MIKE

How much to fix it, Vig? Did he

say?

VIGMAN

Six grand to replace everything.

MIKE

Holy shit.

VIGMAN

Tell me about it. I gotta be

honest, Mike, it's not a good time

for me. My business is off and my

step son wants to get Lasik.

MIKE

Really? Isn't he too young?

VIGMAN

I don't really care at this point.

If it makes him happy, he can have

it. I get nothing from that kid.

(MORE)

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 7

CONTINUED:

VIGMAN (CONT'D)

Nothing. He has an unnatural

attachment to his father.

MIKE

Right. So what do you want to do?

VIGMAN

Well I was thinking we could leave

it for now and just cover the file

cabinets in plastic to be safe. How

about you?

MIKE

Yeah. I guess I'm good with that.

VIGMAN

Let's get out of here before it

blows. I'll pick some up plastic

before practice.

MIKE

Hey Shelly, How you doing?

SHELLY

I'm a little hung over and my

boyfriend's a moron.

MIKE

Oh. Sorry to hear that.

SHELLY

How'd the team do last night?

MIKE

We lost.

SHELLY

Bummer. Your noon canceled so you

just have a 10:30 and 3pm.

MIKE

OK. Anything else?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 8

CONTINUED:

SHELLY

The toilet isn't flushing again.

Should I just call someone this

time?

MIKE

No. I'll take a look at it. Who do

I have at ten-thirty?

SHELLY

(APOLOGETICALLY)

Frank.

MIKE

Great.

MIKE

And you think your son stole it?

FRANK

Yeah. I know he did.

MIKE

Why would he steal your cat, Frank?

FRANK

He's jealous of her. Very jealous.

MIKE

I understand but that's my fee for

that particular service. Uh huh.

Right. Well maybe I can adjust that

a little bit.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 9

MIKE

Well Leo, remember you got lost and

the police had to help you a few

times. That's why we brought Jolie

into help you, right?

LEO

So now what happens?

MIKE

Well if that Judge deems you

incapacitated then you will need a

guardian. And if we can't find your

daughter then the state...

LEO

She can't find herself.

MIKE

OK but if we can't find her then

the State will have to become your

guardian.

LEO

Who's the state?

MIKE

You know...the state...of New

Jersey.

LEO

That's crazy. I don't need New

Jersey's help. I got Jolie now. And

there's no funny business between

us so you know.

MIKE

Right. I'm sure there's not. Let's

just first see if we can find your

daughter and then we'll go from

there.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 10

SHELLY

Am I still hung over or is that

noise getting louder?

MIKE

You're probably still hung over.

What's that?

SHELLY

Leo's financial statements. He's

loaded, huh?

MIKE

Yes, he is. You find his daughter?

SHELLY

No. That lady is gone and doesn't

want to be found.

MIKE

Crap.

SHELLY

Can't the state just leave him in

his home? That's what the guy

wants.

MIKE

They could but they never will.

It's too much work. They'll

probably move him into Oak Knoll.

Hand me one of their brochures?

SHELLY

But he has Jolie now. She can

handle it.

MIKE

No, she can't. His guardian still

has to make every single decision.

It's the difference between a baby

sitter and a parent.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 11

CONTINUED:

SHELLY

I wish I could do it. I could use

an extra 1,500 bucks a month.

MIKE

$1,500. Is that what it is?

SHELLY

Yeah. It's in his file.

(Answering the phone)

Mike Flaherty's office.

VIGMAN

Whose singlet is this? What did I

say about leaving them around?

TERRY

How's the team doing?

MIKE

Not good.

TERRY

What the hell happened? We used to

be good.

MIKE

Yeah, well we're not anymore.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 12

CONTINUED:

TERRY

Can we walk for a bit?

MIKE

Yeah.

TERRY

That sucked. You're running good,

buddy. Kicking my ass.

MIKE

Yeah. I've been getting out here a

bit more often.

TERRY

You gotta be kidding me.

MIKE

What?

TERRY

Lori's texting me at seven in the

morning to ask me if I want an

antique sewing table that we bought

together.

MIKE

Do you?

TERRY

No. I want my fucking house back!

MIKE

Is she still with that guy?

TERRY

You mean my contractor? The guy I

hired? Yeah, she is. I can just

picture that little scumbag walking

around my house wearing his tool

belt. Here.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Take a picture for me.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 13

CONTINUED:

TERRY MIKE

TERRY (CONT'D)

Hurry! It's cold.

MIKE

Don't send it.

TERRY

Too late. I hate her.

MIKE

Maybe you should move back into the

city? Get a new job. Shake it up a

bit.

TERRY

Nah. Finley called me. He's

starting up a new fund out here in

May so I'm gonna wait for that.

MIKE

That guy's starting another fund?

TERRY

Yeah. He's an animal. He prints

money. Come on, let's finish

strong.

MIKE

Hold up!

TERRY

What?

MIKE

Just...hold up.

TERRY

You alright?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 14

CONTINUED:

TERRY (CONT'D) MIKE

TERRY (CONT'D)

Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Fuck! Fuck!

TERRY (CONT'D)

You gotta be kidding me. Shit.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Is it your heart, buddy? Are you

having a heart attack?

MIKE

No! I'm not having a heart attack!

I just...can't breathe...

TERRY

That could be a heart attack, Mike.

You should lie down.

MIKE TERRY

MIKE

No! It's wet. I don't want to lie

down.

TERRY

Who cares? You might be dying. Are

you cold? Do you feel cold?

MIKE

Yeah. I'm lying on the ground.

TERRY

Look into my eyes, Mike. Look into

my eyes.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 15

CONTINUED:

WOMAN (O.S.)

Are you alright?

TERRY

OK dude, how long has that been

happening?

MIKE

Couple of months. The doctor says

it's stress.

TERRY

Seriously? Did he prescribe

anything for you?

MIKE

Yeah. Jogging. Why the hell you

think I'm doing this?

TERRY

Jesus. That scared the shit out of

me. What are you so stressed about,

Mike?

MIKE

(SHEEPISH)

I don't know. Work. Money.

Everything.

TERRY

Is it that bad?

MIKE

Yeah. It is. I don't know how much

longer I can keep my practice

going.

TERRY

Really? Holy shit, Mike! What're

you gonna do?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 16

CONTINUED:

MIKE

I have no frickin' idea. I've been

trying everything.

TERRY

Have you told Jackie?

MIKE

Not yet. I don't want to freak her

out.

TERRY

Good call. So we just need a new

strategy, that's all. What about

that Judge that's always throwing

work your way? Can't she help you

out?

MIKE

Judge Lee, yeah. If it wasn't for

her I'd probably be out of business

already. I just need more.

TERRY

Is there anything else you can do

for money?

MIKE

What the hell am I gonna do?

Bartend? I'm a lawyer, Ter. I

practice law.

MIKE (CONT'D) TERRY

TERRY

Yeah. But that's why he makes it.

MIKE

No shit, Ter. Thanks for the

update.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 17

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Hi, honey. I'm still at the office.

Yeah. I came back after practice,

I'll be home in a bit.

(Checking his blackberry)

Oh, hey, let me go, Jack. I've been

waiting for this call. Bye.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hey Tom. Thanks for getting back to

me. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, I was

just following up to see if you had

any overflow. It's been a slow

month on this end and I was...

MIKE (CONT'D)

Oh. OK. No, yeah of course. I

appreciate that. Thanks, Tom. Bye.

MIKE

Hey, Leo. Leo hold on!

(to the Guard)

Can you stop him, please?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 18

CONTINUED:

JUDGE LEE

Any word from his daughter? Mr.

Flaherty?

MIKE

Oh..no, Your Honor. I have the two

certified letters returned

unclaimed. And there is no phone

number for her. We can't find her.

JUDGE LEE

And she is the only living family,

is that correct?

MIKE

Yes, your Honor, she is. But Mr.

Poplar hasn't seen her for over

twenty years.

LEO

Who?

MIKE

Your daughter.

LEO

She's late? She's probably at the

store buying some crap or

something.

MIKE

OK.

JUDGE LEE

OK, then as, Mr. Poplar has been

deemed incapacitated by this court,

I'm appointing the Office of Public

Guardian to serve as the guardian

for his person and property. Do you

have the order for me to sign, Mr.

Thatcher?

THATCHER

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

JUDGE LEE

Then please approach.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 19

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Your Honor, if it pleases the

Court.

JUDGE LEE

Yes, Mr. Flaherty?

MIKE

I would be willing to serve as Mr.

Poplar's guardian.

THATCHER

(Stopping.)

Really?

MIKE

Yeah.

THATCHER

How long have you known him? Two

weeks?

MIKE

More like five.

THATCHER

Really? And now you want to be his

guardian?

MIKE

May I approach, your honor?

JUDGE LEE

Council approach.

JUDGE LEE (CONT'D)

What's going on Mike?

MIKE

Well Judge, I think I'd be a better

candidate then the state in this

case.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 20

CONTINUED:

THATCHER

Really?

MIKE

Yeah, and stop saying really, it's

annoying.

MIKE (CONT'D) THATCHER

Honor.

MIKE (CONT'D)

And, as his lawyer, I feel like I'm

in a better position to execute

what my client wants.

THATCHER

Your Honor, Mr. Flaherty is Mr.

Poplar's court appointed

attorney...

JUDGE LEE

I know, Stu, I appointed him.

THATCHER

Yeah, well that hardly qualifies

him to be Leo's Guardian. What's

the motivation here?

JUDGE LEE

Mike?

MIKE

Your Honor, Leo told me he wants

to live at home. He has the money

to do that and I want to make sure

that happens. If the State can do

that then fine.

THATCHER

Counsel knows we can't do that,

your Honor.

(MORE)

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 21

CONTINUED:

THATCHER (CONT'D)

We're spread too thin for that kind

of individual attention. But they

have an excellent elder care

facility in Mr. Poplar's town.

We'll put him there.

MIKE

Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.

JUDGE MALONE

(TO MIKE)

You can do that, Mike?

MIKE

Yes, I can.

(TO THATCHER)

Really.

LEO

Did we win?

MIKE

Yeah. I think so.

LEO

Good.

LEO

Are we going to the park?

MIKE

No. We're not, Leo. I'm gonna help

you get settled into a new place to

live right here in town.

LEO

I don't need a new place. I have a

house. I'm not fancy that way.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 22

CONTINUED:

MIKE

I know. But I need you to stay in

this new place for a while. It's

nice. You'll like it.

LEO

Is that what the judge said?

MIKE

Yeah, that's what he said.

LEO

Ah shit.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 23

CONTINUED:

JACKIE

Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold and

I need to pick up some bagels for

your mom's.

MIKE

OK. OK. I just have to make one

stop first.

JACKIE

Where?

MIKE

I have to swing by a client's house

and shut off the water.

JACKIE

Why?

MIKE

Because it's freezing and I don't

want his pipes to burst.

JACKIE

No, I mean why are you doing it?

MIKE

(CASUALLY)

What? Oh, because I'm his guardian.

JACKIE

What? Since when?

MIKE ABBY

JACKIE (CONT'D)

That's a big deal, Mike. Were you

even gonna tell me?

MIKE JACKIE

JACKIE (CONT'D)

You don't have time to be taking

care of some old man.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 24

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Jack, he's in Oak Knoll. They do

everything. I just have to check in

on him from time to time.

JACKIE

And who pays for that?

MIKE

He does. It comes out of his estate

and he can afford it. Trust me.

JACKIE

I don't get it. You've never done

it before.

MIKE

No I haven't.

JACKIE

So why are you doing it now?

MIKE

It's just...the right thing to do,

alright. We couldn't find his

daughter and I'm just trying to

help the guy. It's really not a big

deal.

JACKIE

Well, it sounds like a big deal.

And you should have told me.

ABBY

What's a big deal?

JACKIE

Ask your daddy, sweetie. Maybe

he'll tell you.

ABBY

Daddy, what's a big deal?

JACKIE

Is that his house?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 25

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Yeah.

JACKIE

(Re: the Young Man)

Who's that?

MIKE

No idea.

MIKE

How you doing? Can I help you?

YOUNG MAN

No.

MIKE

Are you looking for Mr. Poplar?

YOUNG MAN

Yeah.

MIKE

Well, he doesn't live here anymore.

YOUNG MAN

Where does he live?

MIKE

You mind telling me why you're

looking for him first?

YOUNG MAN

He's my Grandfather. I came to live

with him.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 26

JACKIE

So do you live around here, Kyle?

KYLE

No. Ohio.

JACKIE

Ohio? And where are your parents?

KYLE

It's just my mother and me. She's

back in Columbus. She couldn't

come.

JACKIE

So how did you get here?

KYLE

Bus.

JACKIE

Really? All by yourself?

KYLE

Yeah.

JACKIE

Wow.

ABBY

That sounds like a big deal.

MIKE

Hey, Leo, you have a visitor.

LEO

Who? Him?

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Yeah.

KYLE

Hi.

LEO

Come on in. I'll turn off the TV.

MIKE

This is Kyle Timmons, Leo. He's

your grandson. He came from Ohio to

see you.

LEO

I don't have a Grandson.

KYLE

Yeah, you do. We just never met.

LEO

Are you bringing me home?

MIKE

Kyle's just here for a visit, Leo.

LEO

Oh. You want to watch TV?

KYLE

OK.

MIKE

OK. So I'll come back to pick you

up in an hour. You OK?

KYLE

GINA

So did you call his mother?

JACKIE

No. Not yet. Oh and he was smoking

too. He's sixteen!

GINA

He's probably on drugs.

JACKIE

I know.

GINA

What are you going to do with him?

MIKE

We're going to send him back is

what we're going to do.

GINA

Well I hope so. You have your hands

full over there. And now taking

care of that old man too. That

sounds like a lot, Mike.

JACKIE

Thank you, Gina. I agree. He

somehow forgot to tell me about it.

MIKE

I told you.

JACKIE

Not until I asked.

GINA

His daughter should be taking care

of him. Not you. You have me to

worry about.

MIKE

I don't have to worry about him.

He's at Oak Knoll.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 29

ABBY

Daddy? Can we play croquet today?

GINA

The whole thing just sounds crazy.

JACKIE

It is crazy. It's crazy.

ABBY

(TO MIKE)

Who's crazy?

MIKE

Me.

MIKE

How did the visit go?

KYLE

OK. He fell asleep watching TV. So

he lives there now?

MIKE

Yeah. Your grandfather is in the

early stages of dementia, Kyle. So

sometimes he does things and says

things that don't make sense.

KYLE

Are you a friend of his or

something?

MIKE

I'm his guardian.

KYLE

What's that mean?

MIKE

It means I make sure he's well

taken care of.

KYLE

That's cool.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 30

JACKIE

Everything alright?

KYLE

Yeah.

JACKIE

Did you reach your mom?

KYLE

Yeah. I told her I was coming home.

JACKIE

Did she want to talk to me or

anything?

KYLE

No.

JACKIE

Well, I'm sorry you can't stay

longer but maybe you can come back

with your mom and visit again.

KYLE

Yeah. If I want to smoke should I

go outside?

JACKIE

You shouldn't be smoking.

KYLE

I know. But if I do.

JACKIE

Yeah. You should go outside.

KYLE

OK. Good night, Jackie.

JACKIE

Good night, Kyle.

MIKE

What are you doing?

JACKIE

We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking

any chances with Eminem down there.

MIKE

There's not even a bathroom down

there.

LEO

Hey Mike, could you talk to them

about getting Coco Puffs? I like

that kind.

MIKE

Sure thing, Leo.

LEO

(TO KYLE)

Mike's a stand up guy. You need

cereal then talk to him.

MIKE

We should go, Kyle.

MIKE

Breaking and entering.

JACKIE

What?

MIKE

So what happened?

KYLE

I decided not to go home.

MIKE

And then you decided you'd break

into your Grandfather's house?

KYLE

You mind if I have a quick smoke?

MIKE

Yeah, I do. Get in the car.

MIKE

So you want to tell me what

happened?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 34

KYLE

Not really.

MIKE

Yeah. Well good luck with that,

pal.

MIKE (CONT'D)

You'll see.

JACKIE

Kyle?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

We can't help you if you don't tell

us what's going on. Is there a

reason you don't want to go home?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

What happened to your eye, Kyle?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Kyle. You can trust us.

KYLE

I can't live there anymore.

JACKIE

With your Mom? Did she do that to

your eye?

KYLE

No. She's not even there. She's in

a clinic or hospital or whatever.

I'm living with Craig.

JACKIE

Who's Craig?

KYLE

Her boyfriend, I guess, but he's an

asshole.

JACKIE

Does she even know you're here?

KYLE

My mom? She doesn't care about me.

JACKIE

How do you know? She's probably

worried sick and just doesn't know

how to reach you.

KYLE

She could've called, right?

JACKIE (O.S.)

We don't have a choice now.

MIKE

So what are we gonna do? Adopt him?

JACKIE

No. But I'm not sending him back

until I talk to his mother. She

better freaking call me back.

MIKE

Honey, I know it's tough but we're

not in a position to take care of

another kid right now.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 36

CONTINUED:

JACKIE

I don't care. I'm not sending him

back there, Mike. I can't. And for

the record, I'm not very happy

about it either!

MIKE

Then we don't have to do this.

JACKIE

Yes, we do, Mike! We do. It makes

me so angry and so damn sad to see

that poor kid in that kind of

situation. He's just a kid.

MIKE

I know. I know. You're right.

JACKIE

I just want to go to Ohio

and...beat the crap out of his mom.

MIKE

Come on.

JACKIE

I do. I want to beat the crap out

of her and her stupid boyfriend.

MIKE

OK.

JACKIE

I'm serious.

MIKE

I know. I'm just not sure that

beating the crap out of everybody

is the best solution.

JACKIE

Well it feels like it. I'm leaving

her another message.

MIKE

Now?

JACKIE

Yes. Now. Shush!

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 37

TERRY (O.S.)

So get rid of him again.

MIKE (O.S.)

I can't. Not until we figure what's

going on back there.

Have you talked to his mother?

MIKE

No. Not yet. Jack's left her about

thirty messages.

TERRY

Mother fucker. He's wearing his

tool belt.

MIKE (O.S.)

What? Who?

TERRY

No. Sorry dude, I was distracted.

MIKE (O.S.)

Where are you? Are you watching

Lori's house again?

Jackie made me take him with me.

TERRY (O.S.)

Alright, listen pal, this is not

the time to long that stock, you

know what I mean?

MIKE

No. What does that mean?

TERRY

It means you shouldn't be taking

care of another kid. Especially a

convict.

MIKE

(ON PHONE)

Yeah, well...

SHELLY

I found her.

MIKE

Let me call you back.

TERRY (O.S.)

Fine. But get rid of the convict,

Mike!

SHELLY

She's in a drug treatment program

in Columbus. She has five weeks to

go.

MIKE

Jesus. Can I talk to her?

SHELLY

They said she would call you.

SHELLY (CONT'D)

He's kind of a sweet kid but what's

up with hair?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 39

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Who knows?

MIKE (CONT'D)

Yeah.

KYLE

Can I go visit Leo?

MIKE

Uh...yeah...OK. You know where it

is?

KYLE

Yeah. Just down the street.

MIKE

OK, yeah. Just stay there and I'll

pick you up at about three.

KYLE

OK.

SHELLY

That's some crazy hair, I'm just

saying.

MIKE

Hey, Rew, what are you doing?

Coach, can you get on Pill.

VIGMAN

Get up, Rew.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 40

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Everyone watch because none of you

are doing it right. You want to put

your chest into his side.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit

more. Yeah. Right there. Then you

give him your full weight. Go ahead

Vig.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Then you ride the crotch and break

him down with a cross-face.

STEMLER

Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill?

We'll just call you "pancake"!

PILL

Shut up, Chewbaka.

STEMLER

Yeah, right. More like the "Secret

Apprentice".

FEENEY

What are you, ten years old,

Stemler?

MIKE

Hey! We're trying to teach you guys

something and you're all just

goofing off. Shut up!

VIG

Quiet!

MIKE

Last time I checked we haven't won

a match! Right coach?!

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 41

CONTINUED:

VIG

It's embarrassing, guys.

MIKE

It's embarrassing. But you're all

acting like you don't care! Well,

I'm not getting paid enough to just

jerk around here.

(gestures to Vig)

I don't know about you?

VIG

I'm not getting paid enough.

MIKE

I care about what I do and so

should you!

VIG

I care!

MIKE

So does coach Vig, and so should

you! Run em, Coach. I can't look

at them anymore!

VIG

Let's go ladies!

JACKIE

Here, have some more corn.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I'll get you some more milk too.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Did you call Fenn about the tree,

Mike?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 42

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Uh...yeah I did but Terry said he'd

help and I think we can...

JACKIE

Mike. Don't start. You two are not

cutting down that tree. Just call

Fenn.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I'm going to give her some Tylenol.

ABBY

(TO KYLE)

Do you want to play croquet?

KYLE

Now?

ABBY

When it's warm.

KYLE

Yeah, maybe.

ABBY

Daddy, can I watch TV?

MIKE

Uh...yeah but just for a half hour.

KYLE

Hey Mike, you think I could

practice with you guys tomorrow?

MIKE

Yeah, if you want. Sure. And by the

way, what I did in there today,

yelling like that. I don't usually

do that.

KYLE

You were right, they deserved it.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 43

KYLE

I don't have wrestling shoes.

MIKE

Don't worry about it. You ever

wrestle before?

KYLE

Yeah.

VIGMAN

Get that ankle. Get that ankle!

Time!

MIKE

Hey Vig. Alright, guys, listen up!

Kyle's going to be working out with

us for a little while.

STEMLER

(LOUDLY)

What's up Kyle!

VIGMAN

Carlos, you and Jimmy rotate him

in.

VIGMAN (CONT'D)

OK. Let's go. Ten seconds to get an

ankle. Then we switch it up. Ready?

Wrestle!

MIKE

Time. Switch. And...wrestle!

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 44

CONTINUED:

MIKE

You have fun?

KYLE

Yeah.

MIKE

When's the last time you wrestled?

KYLE

A couple years ago.

MIKE

Why'd you stop?

KYLE

Just felt like it.

MIKE

So let me ask you something, Kyle.

How good are you?

KYLE

I'm pretty good.

MIKE

Holy shit.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 45

MIKE (O.S.)

You check out that link I sent you?

TERRY (O.S.)

Yeah. Kyle Timmons. That's the kid?

MIKE (O.S.)

Yeah. That's the kid!

TERRY

Holy shit!

MIKE

I know, right? Can you believe

that?!

TERRY

Holy shit! He was thirty-five and

one as a freshman!

MIKE

I know. He finished second at the

states. In Ohio!

TERRY

This kid had seventeen pins. He's a

killer.

MIKE

I know. It's nuts. And he quit

after his freshman year.

TERRY

Why?

MIKE

I don't know. He doesn't talk much.

He's kind of a weird kid. Why

can't I have one kid like that on

my team? Just one.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 46

CONTINUED:

TERRY

What're you talking about? You do.

You have him. You can take this kid

to the states, Mike.

MIKE

He's not on the team, Ter. He's not

even a student. He's been here for

three days.

TERRY

So what? Enroll him!

MIKE

I'm not enrolling him. He's just

here until we reach his mother and

figure this out.

TERRY

So he's gotta do something, right?

Let him wrestle. Look at this way,

you're helping out the old man and

this kid's a little bonus for doing

the right thing.

MIKE

I'm not just helping out the old

man, Ter. It's not like it's

charity work. I'm getting paid for

it.

TERRY

No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but

think about it, Mike. What are the

chances that this kid ends up on

your door step and he can wrestle

like that? It's a sign, pal.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Check this out. There's a video

link of him wrestling in some

tournament.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Look at that kid.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 47

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Wow. He's gonna throw him. Look,

he's setting him up. He's setting

him up!

JACKIE

Here's five dollars for lunch. I

have no idea what it costs but let

me know when you find out.

KYLE

I have money.

JACKIE

Good for you. Save it. Now take

this, it's too early to argue.

MIKE

OK. Let's go, pal.

JACKIE

Bye Jackie.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Hey, you sure we should do this?

MIKE

Why not? Whether he's here for two

more days or two weeks it gives him

something to do all day. Unless you

want him hanging out here?

JACKIE

OK. Go.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 48

SHELLY

Hey Mike, we got a check from Leo

Poplar's trust for $1,500 but it's

made out to you and not the firm.

MIKE

Right. I'll take that.

SHELLY

Shouldn't I deposit it in the

business account?

MIKE

No. It's not a legal fee. It's a

personal fee.

SHELLY

For what?

MIKE

Oh, I ended up taking on Leo's

guardianship.

SHELLY

(SURPRISED)

Really?

MIKE

Yeah, I thought I mentioned that to

you.

SHELLY

No, you definitely didn't mention

that.

MIKE

Yeah, well, it just played out that

way. I have to get going.

SHELLY

Well can we put some of that in the

business account so they don't take

our copier back?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 49

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Uh..not this time. Next month.

Promise.

SHELLY

We need our copier, Mike.

MIKE

I know. Bye Shelly.

SHELLY

And that noise is getting louder.

I'm not hung over today!

MIKE

Hey honey. I'm good. Could you do

me a favor and drop that health

insurance check in the mail? I just

forgot to mail it. Yeah, it's on my

desk. Thanks. I'll call you later.

TERRY

What's up Fella's? Hitting the

showers, huh?

(TO HIMSELF)

That sounded weird.

TERRY

Oh yeah!

MIKE

Hey.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 50

CONTINUED:

TERRY

What's up? Hey Vig.

VIGMAN

Hi Terry.

MIKE

What are you doing here?

TERRY

What do you think? I have to see

this kid.

VIGMAN

He's incredible. Just incredible.

And he's good to wrestle.

TERRY

Great. So what's next?

MIKE

We're trying to figure out where he

can wrestle?

TERRY

Where ever the hell he wants,

right?

MIKE

No. Not right.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hey Kyle. Come on in. How was

school?

KYLE

OK.

MIKE

This is my friend Terry.

TERRY

Hey man! Nice to meet you! Really

nice to meet you. Welcome.

KYLE

Thanks.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 51

CONTINUED:

MIKE

How the shoe's fit?

KYLE

Good.

MIKE

So let me ask you something, Kyle.

You think you might want to wrestle

in a match?

KYLE

OK.

MIKE

Great. We have a match on Saturday.

What do you wrestle?

KYLE

One-nineteen.

TERRY

Excellent. Done.

KYLE

Is anyone there now?

MIKE

Yeah. Jimmy Reed. But I think he

might be better off at 125.

KYLE

Don't you think we should wrestle

off?

MIKE/TERRY/VIG

Yeah.

VIGMAN

Alright, let's go guys. Wrestle

off.

MIKE

Vig, you keep time?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 52

CONTINUED:

VIGMAN

Yeah.

TERRY

I'll do it.

TERRY (CONT'D)

You don't mind, do you?

VIGMAN

No. Go ahead.

VIGMAN (CONT'D)

Ready? And...wrestle.

TERRY

Wow!

KYLE

Good match.

JIMMY

Didn't feel good.

VIGMAN

I don't think we can teach him

anything.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 53

TERRY

I don't know why we didn't quit.

Just the smell of that room brought

back the memories. I hated it, it

was like a form of self-abuse.

KYLE

Were you guys that bad?

TERRY

Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry

Abby.

ABBY

It's OK.

MIKE

I gotta stop by the office and deal

with the computer. Should I...?

JACKIE

No, I'll take him.

TERRY

We both should have quit. Then we

could have joined the ski club and

gotten busy with Allison Shepard on

the overnights.

MIKE JACKIE

ABBY

Who was busy?

JACKIE

Your Uncle Terry is just silly.

TERRY

Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 54

KYLE

Hey, how do you think we'd do

against Kyle? Now?

MIKE (O.S.)

He'd kill us. Both of us. Together.

TERRY

Yeah, you're right. The kid has man

strength, dude.

MIKE

Man strength?

TERRY

Yeah. You know. Not kid strength.

Man strength.

MIKE

Yeah...I wouldn't say that around

the locker room.

TERRY

What the hell are you doing anyway?

MIKE

Trying to figure out what's wrong

with my fricking back-up system.

TERRY

Just call your IT guy?

MIKE

I don't have an IT guy. IT guys

cost money.

TERRY

OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my

mind. I want to be an assistant

coach too.

MIKE

Seriously?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 55

CONTINUED:

TERRY

Yeah. Why not? I'm value added.

Especially compared to Vig.

MIKE

How are you value added?

TERRY

Well first of all I'm fun. No

denying that. And secondly, unlike

Vig, I actually used to wrestle.

MIKE

Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.

TERRY

That doesn't matter, your team

sucks. Plus I even look more like a

coach then Vig.

MIKE

Yeah, that's not really value

added.

TERRY

Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I

need some distraction in my life

right now. All I do is sit in my

condo and think about Lori and that

guy having sex in the jacuzzi I

paid for. It's fucking unhealthy.

I've been really kind of going

crazy. Really.

MIKE

We start at 3:30pm. Don't be late.

TERRY

My brother! I will not let you

down. To the team.

TERRY (CONT'D)

Hey, what should I wear to

practice?

MIKE

Just a singlet.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 56

CONTINUED:

TERRY

Really?

MIKE

Yeah, so we can see your man

strength.

TERRY

Good one, Coach! See, it's already

fun.

JACKIE

Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty.

Kyle is staying with us. Hello?

(She closes the phone)

I'm gonna kill that lady.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Oh. Hi. I heard your phone ringing

and...

KYLE

You answered it?

JACKIE

Yeah, well, I saw it was your Mom

and we've been waiting to hear from

her.

KYLE

What'd she say?

JACKIE

She didn't say anything. She hung

up. Have you talked to her?

KYLE

No. Can you not answer my phone

anymore?

JACKIE

Yeah. OK. I can do that. I'm sorry.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 57

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Oh. Here's a bucket. You shouldn't

be smoking but if you do could you

put the cigarettes in here.

KYLE

I quit now that I'm wrestling

JACKIE

Oh. Good. OK.

JACKIE

Is that Abby?

MIKE

If it is, she just ran away.

MIKE

Were you outside?

KYLE

Yeah. I went for a run.

MIKE

It's pretty early. You do this

every morning?

KYLE

In season, yeah. I like to get my

run in early and then drill some

moves for an hour before school.

MIKE

Oh. Wow.

KYLE

Yeah...so I'm gonna do it. See you.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 58

It was Kyle.

JACKIE

What's he doing?

MIKE

Working out.

JACKIE

Is he gonna do it every morning?

MIKE

In season. Yeah.

JACKIE

I hate you.

MIKE

I know.

TERRY

This song sucks.

VIGMAN

Rew picked it. He's an odd one.

TERRY

Hey Vig, which kid is yours anyway?

VIGMAN

None of them. He quit.

TERRY

Really? You're son quit?

VIGMAN

My step son and yes. Don't get me

started, I thought becoming a coach

might be a nice way for us to bond.

He said it wasn't fierce and he

quit.

TERRY

Harsh. So why you still doing it?

MIKE

Vig is leading by example. Winners

never quit.

VIGMAN

That's right, even if it sucks.

This team is just depressing

sometimes.

VIGMAN (CONT'D)

That's where I sit, Ter.

TERRY

Sorry buddy. I got to be near,

Mike. It's good luck.

VIGMAN

Say's who?

MIKE

Guys. I don't think we should fight

about our seats in front of the

kids.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 60

MIKE

OK. You ready?

KYLE

Yeah.

MIKE

This kid is good. So just...you

know...be ready out there.

KYLE

Can you give me a slap?

MIKE

What?

KYLE

Give me a slap. Across the face.

Like your waking me up.

MIKE

Uh, OK.

KYLE

Can you do it harder?

TERRY

Come on, Kyle. Take this punk out.

Ter! Cut the shit! You're a coach.

You're not sitting in the stands.

TERRY

Sorry. I'm just excited. You know

me.

What's he doing?

VIGMAN

Losing.

MIKE

It's his first match. Give him a

break.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hey! You OK?

KYLE

That's got nothing to do with luck.

MIKE

How'd that feel? Pretty good?

KYLE

Yeah, pretty good.

MIKE

You ready?

JIMMY

Yeah. Can you slap me too, Coach?

JACKIE

I'm going to the market. I'll be

back in a bit.

KYLE

Can I go with you?

JACKIE

Uh...yeah OK.

KYLE

It's for Leo.

JACKIE

Nice. Drop it in, it's on me. Go

ahead.

(KYLE DOES)

How's he doing?

KYLE

He's doing OK. He can say some

pretty funny things. Yesterday he

told me I was fired.

JACKIE

Fired? For what?

KYLE

I don't know. He just fired me.

JACKIE

I think I have to meet this Leo.

KYLE

Yeah. He's a pretty funny dude.

JACKIE

You have any home work?

KYLE

A little but I already did it.

JACKIE

Impressive. You ever think about

going to college?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 64

CONTINUED:

KYLE

Yeah but just to wrestle. My old

coach thought I could get a

scholarship.

JACKIE

Yeah, I hear you're pretty good. So

why'd you quit?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

You don't have to tell me. It's

alright.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Do you like tacos?

KYLE

Yeah.

JACKIE

Me, too. I make a mean taco.

VIGMAN

Let's go! Circle up!

MIKE

Alright. I want to spend this week

working on bottom position. Did you

all see Kyle the other day? He

exploded up. Kyle, show the guys

what you did.

KYLE

It's kind of my own thing.

MIKE

So can you share it with us?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 65

CONTINUED:

KYLE

Well, it's not a move or anything,

I just tell myself that the guy on

top is going to take my head and

shove it under water and kill me.

And if I don't want to die on the

bottom, I just gotta do what ever

the fuck it takes to get out.

VIGMAN

OK. So the move is called "whatever

the fuck it takes." Let's go. Let's

work on it. Come on. "Whatever the

fuck it takes."

LEO

You're mother didn't want to come?

KYLE

No.

LEO

She's a tough kid that one. She

tell you bad things about me?

KYLE

Yeah. But I never believe her

anyway.

LEO

You should, she's your mother.

Respect that.

(Pointng to the TV)

Can you turn that down? I hate that

judge. I wouldn't be in this place

if it wasn't for her.

KYLE

But this place is pretty nice.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 66

LEO

It's not my damn house! I paid for

that house. Damn Judge. Turn it

off!

KYLE

You want to take a walk outside,

Leo?

LEO

Yeah. Let's go to my park.

KYLE

Your park, huh?

LEO

Yeah. My park.

MIKE

You bring the tape?

KYLE

Yeah. It's in my bag.

KYLE (CONT'D)

Hey, Mike, can I ask you something?

MIKE

Yeah. Of course. What?

KYLE

Leo told me that some Judge made

him move into that place. Is that

true or is he just making that up?

MIKE

No. That's true, pal.

KYLE

Why?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 67

MIKE

Well because they can take good

care of him there, Kyle.

KYLE

But he wants to live at home.

MIKE

I know, pal. Hang on a minute.

Hello? Yes. This is him.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Oh. Can you hang for a moment?

(TO KYLE)

Hey, I have to take this. I'll be

right in, OK? We can talk in a

minute.

MIKE (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Yeah. How are you doing?

JACKIE

What? She doesn't even know us!

MIKE

Yeah, well I think she heard that

I'm a lawyer and I have a family

and that was good enough.

JACKIE

For how long?

MIKE

Another month, I guess, until she

gets out of rehab. She said that

Craig guy took off. She sounded

pretty shaky.

JACKIE

In the basement with Abby.

Yes, it is. So what do we do?

JACKIE

We let him stay. I don't know, do

we even have a choice?

MIKE

I guess we don't.

STEMLER

You nervous?

KYLE

No.

STEMLER

I am.

KYLE

You're not wrestling.

STEMLER

I know. I'm just nervous a lot.

KYLE

You ever think about wrestling in a

match?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 69

CONTINUED:

STEMLER

Yeah. I'm just waiting for the

green light from Coach. But I'm

glad I'm not wrestling today. These

guys are ranked fourth in the

state. And you're wrestling Kenny

Randall. He's undefeated. He is

tough! Really tough.

KYLE

Thanks for letting me know.

VIGMAN

Hey! Cut the chatter! You should

all be playing the "what if" game.

What if he shoots a single leg?

What if he controls my wrists?

STEMLER

What if we all get pinned like last

year?

VIGMAN

Shut up, Stemler! Or I'll throw you

off the bus myself!

TERRY

Did they really pin all of you?

VIGMAN

Just about. It's gonna be a fucking

bloodbath.

MIKE

OK. This is Kenny Randall. He's

very good.

KYLE

Yeah, I heard.

MIKE

But you have an advantage here, he

has no idea who you are, right?

(MORE)

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 70

MIKE (CONT'D)

So he's gonna be overconfident. You

take advantage of that and when you

get your shot, put him away.

MIKE (CONT'D)

See how he runs out there? I want

that kind of intensity from all of

you.

ABBY

Why did Daddy hit Kyle?

JACKIE

I don't know, honey.

MIKE (CONT'D) TERRY

VIGMAN

He just pinned Kenny Randall. Are

you kidding me?!

something. Stella, who's that?

Ky.

JACKIE

She started saying it at the match

today.

KYLE

That's cool.

JACKIE

OK. So I have to ask, those tatoo's

must have hurt, right?

KYLE

Not really.

JACKIE

Don't lie to me. Look.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

I got it on Spring Break. Hurt like

hell.

KYLE

What's it say?

JACKIE

JBJ. Jon Bon Jovi. I'm a fan. You

got a problem with that?

KYLE

No I do not.

JACKIE

That was fun today. You're good.

I'm glad you started wrestling

again.

KYLE

Yeah. Me too.

JACKIE

No quitting this time, you got

that?

KYLE

Can I tell you something?

JACKIE

Of course.

KYLE

I didn't quit my old team. I got

thrown off.

JACKIE

Why?

KYLE

I stole a car.

JACKIE

What? You're don't even drive.

KYLE

Yeah. That was part of the problem.

JACKIE

Who's car did you steal?

KYLE

A teacher's.

JACKIE

Oh my God.

KYLE

It was really stupid.

JACKIE

Yeah. It was stupid. You could have

killed yourself.

KYLE

Yeah. Everything just got messed up

after that.

JACKIE

Yeah, well we all do stupid things.

But the best part is that you got a

another chance and now you're

kicking butt.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 73

lose weight.

VIGMAN

ages.

Yeah, Coach. I'm pretty sure I'm

ready. Right?

KYLE

Right.

MIKE

Where you gonna wrestle?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 75

CONTINUED:

KYLE

He could wrestle 119. I could bump

up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy

goes 130. Then we're only giving up

one weight class and we got a shot.

MIKE

Huh. Vig?

VIG

Yeah. He's right. It's possible.

TERRY

Have you ever wrestled in a match

before Stemler?

STEMLER

No, I have not.

KYLE

You're just waiting for the green

light, right?

STEMLER

Right. I think now is my time. I

can feel the force.

BH COACH

One twenty-five.

VIGMAN

We start at 125 pounds. Depasquale

and Timmons. We'll finish at 119

pounds. Tomlinson and Stemler.

STEMLER (O.S.)

I'm ready Coach.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 76

CONTINUED:

STEMLER (CONT'D)

Show time.

VIGMAN

Thanks for the update Stemler.

TERRY

We're dead.

MIKE

No. It's gonna be fine.

MIKE

Hook the arm! Carlos, hook the arm!

MIKE (CONT'D)

How we doing?

VIGMAN

With that win, we're up by five. If

Stemler doesn't get pinned, we win.

TERRY

That's a huge fucking "if".

STEMLER (O.S.)

I can hear you, Coach.

VIGMAN

Good job, Ter.

TERRY

Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.

MIKE

Come here, Stemler.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 77

CONTINUED:

MIKE (CONT'D)

You've been practicing for a long

time. You're ready for this. You

hear me?

MIKE (CONT'D)

If you get in trouble out there,

you just listen to me. I'm right

here, OK?

MIKE (CONT'D)

OK. You are not going to get

pinned! You hear me! No way!

STEMLER

(BARELY AUDIBLE)

No way. No way.

MIKE

Good. Now I'm going to slap you.

Ready?

STEMLER

Yeah but not so hard.

STEMLER (CONT'D)

Holy shit! It's Darth Vader! Are

you kidding me? No way!

MIKE/TERRY/VIGMAN

Don't worry. It's just a mask. You

are ready! Get on that line. Now!

KYLE

Hey, Stemler. Come here.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 78

CONTINUED:

KYLE (CONT'D)

If he's Darth Vader then you're the

Secret Apprentice. You got this.

STEMLER

Yeah. You're right.

TERRY

I can't watch.

LATER -

MIKE

Keep moving, Stemler. Keep working!

VIGMAN

(Reading score card)

Oh shit. Oh shit!

TERRY

What?

VIGMAN

He's one point away from a tech

fall and we'd lose on criteria.

MIKE

Shit. Really?

TERRY

What the hell does that mean?

VIGMAN

If he falls behind by fifteen

points it's a technical fall. They

get five team points. If that

happens the score would be tied but

we'd lose the match on criteria.

TERRY

Seriously?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 79

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Fuck this!

MIKE (CONT'D)

Stemler! Stemler!!

MIKE (CONT'D)

You need to get up! He's trying to

drown you! He wants you dead. But

you are not going to die on the

bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?!

MIKE (CONT'D)

Good! Now just do the move we

worked on in practice.

MIKE (CONT'D)

"Whatever the fuck it takes!"

MIKE

Hey, I'm proud of what you did

today. That win meant a lot to the

guys.

KYLE

Cool. It was good coaching with

Stemler.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 80

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Let me ask you something. What's it

like? Being as good as you are?

What's it feel like?

KYLE

I don't know. I guess it just feels

like I'm in control. Of everything.

You know what I mean?

MIKE

Yeah, I do. Must be nice.

KYLE

It is.

VIGMAN

That's it.

MIKE

Yeah.

TERRY

District champ, baby.

VIGMAN

Pure fucking poetry.

KYLE

Hey, Leo. Guess who won the

Districts?

LEO

Who?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 81

CONTINUED:

KYLE

Me. And Mike said he got a call

from a college scout about me.

LEO

Oh.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hi baby.

KYLE

What are you doing here?

CINDY

I came to get you, honey. And to

see Grandpa. I missed you so much.

Can I have a hug, baby?

LEO

Where's he going?

CINDY

Oh, he's just had to go somewhere,

Dad. Do you want some juice?

MIKE

How is he?

JACKIE

He's upset. I don't blame him. It's

weird that she just shows up like

that.

(Checking her watch)

And of course she's late, the

druggie.

MIKE

Honey. Can you stop, please?

JACKIE

You're gonna talk to her, right?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 82

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Yeah. I am. If you don't punch her

first.

MIKE (CONT'D)

It's a cab. It's her.

JACKIE

It's not my fault if I punch her.

MIKE

Yeah, it is. That will be your

fault.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hi. I'm Mike Flaherty. Come in,

please.

CINDY

Hi.

MIKE

And this is my wife, Jackie and my

daughter, Stella.

CINDY

Hi.

JACKIE

Hi, Cindy. Nice to meet you.

CINDY

She's very cute.

JACKIE

Thanks. Abby, our six year old, is

downstairs with Kyle.

CINDY

Oh. OK.

JACKIE

Do you want to sit down?

CINDY

Thanks. This is a very nice house.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 83

CONTINUED:

JACKIE

Thank you very much.

MIKE

Can I get you a drink or something?

MIKE (CONT'D)

Water or soda or anything?

CINDY

No. No thanks. I'm fine.

MIKE

Right. OK. So I'll go get Kyle.

CINDY

How's he doing?

MIKE

Oh, he's doing really well. He's

going to the high school here and

he's wrestling on the team

actually.

CINDY

Really? That's good. He loves

wrestling so much.

JACKIE

He's a really sweet kid. Our girls

love him.

CINDY

That's nice.

CINDY (CONT'D)

I am so sorry about this...it's

just been such a difficult time...

JACKIE

Oh hey...these things happen,

Cindy. And we've loved having him.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 84

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Hi, honey. This is Abby.

CINDY

Hi Abby.

ABBY

Hi.

MIKE

Abby, can you go get Kyle for us?

ABBY

He left.

MIKE

He left? What do you mean?

ABBY

He left out the window.

MIKE

I'm really sorry about this.

CINDY

That's okay. Thanks.

MIKE

You know Kyle's doing really well

with wrestling here, Cindy. The

regions are this weekend and if he

wins there then he goes to the

states.

CINDY

That's great.

MIKE

Yeah. It is and it could be really

good for him. It might even mean a

scholarship. Anyway, I was

wondering if you could stay here

for another three weeks until

that's all over.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 85

CONTINUED:

CINDY

I'd like to but don't think I can

afford to stay in the hotel for

that long. Do you think we could

stay in my dad's house?

MIKE

Uhh...yeah. We could probably make

that work.

CINDY

Then, yeah, I could stay.

MIKE

OK. Good. That's great.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hey.

TERRY (O.S.)

Hey. Kyle's here.

MIKE

Really?

(TO CINDY)

We found him.

TERRY

Yeah. We're playing Wii Golf. I'm

destroying him. Dude, this kid

really hates his mother.

MIKE

Yeah, OK.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 86

CONTINUED:

TERRY (O.S.)

I mean like more then I hate my ex

wife.

MIKE

Great, Ter. Thanks. Bye.

(Mike hangs up)

He went to my friend's house. We

can go get him.

CINDY

Maybe I'll just go back to the

hotel. It might just be too much

for him tonight. I can see him

tomorrow.

MIKE

You sure?

CINDY

Yeah. I think maybe that's better.

I know how Kyle can be.

MIKE

OK. I'll drop you off.

KYLE

So when wrestling's over I have to

go?

MIKE

I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying

so you can finish the season.

That's pretty nice of her.

MIKE (CONT'D)

I told her you'd go see her today,

Kyle.

KYLE

Where?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 87

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Where ever you want. She could come

here or we could go see her at

Leo's house. She moving in this

morning.

KYLE

I'll go see her at Leo's before

practice. But I want to go alone.

MIKE

(HESITANT)

Yeah, that's OK but Kyle but you

have to promise me...

KYLE

Don't worry, Mike. I'll go.

OLD NEIGHBOR

Hi Mike.

MIKE

Hi Betty. How's the foot?

BETTY

Better.

SHELLY

Mike? Cindy's here.

MIKE

Really? Did she say why?

SHELLY

No. But she's here with an

attorney.

MIKE

Hi Cindy. Hi, I'm Mike Flaherty.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 88

CONTINUED:

ELEANOR

Hi, I'm Eleanor Cohen.

MIKE

Please come in.

MIKE (CONT'D)

I wasn't aware that Cindy was

represented by council.

ELEANOR

She retained me last week to help

sort out her father's situation.

MIKE

Last week? I thought she just

arrived two days ago.

(MIKE SITS)

How long have you been here?

ELEANOR

She wanted a little time to settle

in and spend some time with her

father.

MIKE

So how can I help?

ELEANOR

Cindy has decided that she wants a

more active role in her father's

care.

MIKE

What kind of a role is that?

CINDY

I want to take care of him.

MIKE

Really? So you want to move here?

ELEANOR

No. Cindy would like to bring her

father back to Columbus.

CINDY

That's where my support network is

now. It's home.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 89

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Well I'm not sure that's what Leo

wants.

CINDY

I already talked to him about it.

He seem to like the idea.

MIKE

I understand that, Cindy. But you

haven't seen Leo in a long time and

he's battling dementia now so it

puts me in a tough position here.

ELEANOR

She is the presumed Guardian, Mr

Flaherty.

MIKE

I understand that.

ELEANOR

And we do hope to avoid litigation.

MIKE

So do I and I'm sure we can. Now,

I'm sorry, but I actually have to

go see a client so we'll have to

set up another time to discuss

this.

CINDY

Kyle's still coming to see me

today, right?

MIKE

Yeah. Of course. After school.

ELEANOR

I'll have my office call. Come on

Cindy.

CINDY

Thanks Mike.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 90

CONTINUED:

TERRY (V.O.)

I don't get it. Is it that bad?

MIKE

Yeah, it's that bad.

TERRY

Just take her to court, you'll kill

her.

MIKE

I can't.

TERRY

Why not? She's a freaking mess.

You're a pillar of the community,

Mike.

MIKE

I just can't go back in front of

Judge Lee, it won't look good,

trust me.

TERRY

So maybe you'll get a different

judge.

MIKE

She's the only Judge who handles

these cases and if I look bad in

front of her right now, I'm

screwed. I'll have to close my

fricking doors.

TERRY

Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It

sucks but you've got your practice

to worry about, right?

MIKE

Yeah, I do.

TERRY

Incoming, dude.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 91

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Hey, pal.

KYLE

Do you know she wants to take Leo

back to Ohio?

MIKE

Yeah. She just told me today.

KYLE

You're not gonna let her do that

are you?

MIKE

I don't know Kyle. It's

complicated.

KYLE

What's complicated about it? She

doesn't give a shit about Leo. They

hate each other. You can't let her

take him.

MIKE

OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for

practice and I'll deal with it.

KYLE

Fine but I told her I'm staying

with you guys until we leave.

TERRY

Wow. What's your play?

MIKE

I have no idea. I have no freaking

idea!

TERRY

She's looking for a payout, dude.

Just buy her stake and give her an

exit.

MIKE

What the hell does that mean?

TERRY

Just give her some of Leo's money

and send her home. He's not gonna

miss it. He's in happy land.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 92

CONTINUED:

MIKE

No, I can't do that. She's not even

in his...

MIKE (CONT'D)

That's right. She's not and she

doesn't and that's my play.

TERRY

What's your play?

MIKE

Don't worry about it. I just need

to make a call. Can you get

practice started?

TERRY

Really? You want me to slap your

face? Get you psyched up for the

call?

MIKE

No. I really don't.

MIKE (O.S.)

Look, we're all concerned with

what's best for Leo so I'm hoping

we can settle this in an amicable

way.

ELEANOR

So do we.

MIKE

Good, well, I thought I'd start by

laying all the cards on the table,

so maybe you can understand why I'm

hesitating in turning Leo over to

Cindy.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 93

CONTINUED:

ELEANOR

OK.

MIKE

Cindy, your father disinherited you

from his will. Completely. And I'm

afraid that can't change now that

he's been declared incapacitated.

CINDY

(TO ELEANOR)

Is that true?

ELEANOR

We'll have to see a copy of the

will, Mike.

MIKE

Yeah. I actually brought you a

copy.

CINDY

Who did he leave it too? Did he

leave it to Kyle?!

MIKE

No.

CINDY

Then who? You?

MIKE

No. He left everything to the

municipal parks system. He wanted

the town park dedicated in his

name.

CINDY

That scumbag! He never cared about

anyone but himself and his fucking

money. Did you know about this?

ELEANOR

Cindy please!

CINDY

Please what?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 94

CONTINUED:

ELEANOR

(Annoyed to Mike)

I'd like to discuss this with my

client, Mr. Flaherty.

CINDY

What's to discuss? I'm not taking

care of him if I'm not getting

anything for it.

ELEANOR

Cindy, please.

(TO MIKE)

We're finished here.

MIKE

OK.

TERRY

Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.

MIKE

Yeah. And she's gone back to the

motel.

TERRY

That's good.

MIKE

Yes, it is. Yeah, I think it

worked.

TERRY

It totally worked. They opened

their kimono and you made them eat

the trade.

MIKE

I don't what know what your talking

about half the time.

Yeah, he is.

Wow. This is big time. I bet there

are scouts here.

are going to the states. That's

what counts. That's all that

matters. You hear me?

Hey! Kyle. Stay in this, OK. This

is your place. You are in control,

remember! You control it. Now go

get him. Finish this!

KYLE

I'm sorry.

MIKE

Hey, it's alright.

KYLE

I don't want to go with her. I

don't.

MIKE

OK, pal. OK.

MIKE

Why are you here?

CINDY

I wanted to see my son wrestle.

MIKE

Yeah, well your son had a pretty

good chance to do something special

in there. Maybe even change his

life and that's gone now. I hope

you're happy.

CINDY

That's not my fault.

MIKE

It isn't? Why do you think he lost

his shit in there, huh?! What do

you want, lady?

CINDY

I want my father.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 98

CONTINUED:

MIKE

It didn't sound like that the other

day. It sounded like you hated the

guy.

CINDY

You have no idea what my father

used to be like. No idea! He wasn't

like he is now! He treated me like

shit and he was all I had!

MIKE

So now you want to return the

favor? Is that it?!

CINDY

I want that commission! That should

be mine!

MIKE

And that's why you're doing all

this? For fifteen hundred dollars a

month?

CINDY

Isn't that why you did it?

MIKE

Alright, I'll tell you what. You

want the commission? You can have

it. And you don't even have to take

Leo. I'll take care of him for free

and I'll send you the check every

month. On one condition.

CINDY

What's that?

MIKE

You leave Kyle here. With us. Until

he finishes high school.

CINDY

I'm his mother. He belongs with me.

MIKE

Are you sure he feels that way?

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 99

CONTINUED:

CINDY

Don't tell me what my son feels!

He's coming with me and there isn't

anything you can do about that.

MIKE

Then you can't have that

commission.

CINDY

We'll see about that.

MIKE

Yeah, we will.

CINDY

I want to see my son!

MIKE

Then call him! You have his number!

TERRY

We were right there, Mike. Right

fucking there. And now we have

nothing. Nothing!

MIKE

You OK?

TERRY

No.

JACKIE

Mike, your mom's here and dinner's

almost ready. Have you seen Kyle?

MIKE

He's not in the basement?

What a day, huh?

JACKIE

Yeah, right.

JACKIE (CONT'D)

You OK?

JACKIE (CONT'D)

What are we gonna do, Mike?

MIKE

There's nothing to do. I can't stop

her. She's gonna leave and she's

gonna take Kyle and Leo with her.

JACKIE

And you don't think you'd beat her

in court?

MIKE

No. I don't.

JACKIE

Why? It's so obvious she's just

wants him for the money.

MIKE

I just can't win this one, Jackie.

Trust me.

JACKIE

I do.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 101

CINDY

Kyle, honey, come in. I'm so glad

you came.

CINDY (CONT'D)

Have a seat, honey. Do you want a

soda or something?

KYLE

No. What do you want?

CINDY

I just wanted to say how sorry I

was about the match and if I did

anything to cause it then I will

never forgive myself. I know how

much wrestling means to you, baby.

KYLE

Is that why you called me. Just to

tell me that?

CINDY

No. I also wanted to say that I'll

do whatever you think is best for

Leo. I promise.

KYLE

Then leave him here. Where he is.

CINDY

OK. I will. If that's what you

want. But I have to be honest, I'm

not sure that's what Leo wants.

KYLE

What do you mean?

CINDY

Here. Read this.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 102

KYLE

What is it?

CINDY

It's the court transcript from when

Leo was in court. My lawyer got it.

Read the parts in yellow. See what

it says.

KYLE

This isn't real. The Judge told Leo

he had to live there.

CINDY

No, honey. This is official from

the court. It's what Mike said.

CINDY (CONT'D)

He gets paid for being Leo's

guardian, Kyle. And then he just

put him in that place so he didn't

have to worry about him.

CINDY (CONT'D)

Leo belongs with us, Kyle.

KYLE

Why?

CINDY

Why what?

KYLE

Why does he belong with us?

CINDY

Because we deserve that money,

Kyle. Not some lawyer. You're a big

boy. You can understand that.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 103

Shut up! Shut up!

KYLE (CONT'D)

me? Do you?

MIKE

OK. Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it.

Anything?

MIKE

He's not at Stemler's.

JACKIE

This is crazy, where could he be?

I don't know, he's upset, maybe he

went for a walk.

MIKE

I'm trying to stop it!

TERRY

Sit out Mike! Sit out!

JACKIE MIKE

MIKE (CONT'D) TERRY

JACKIE

Would you stop coaching and break

that up!

TERRY

I'm the ref. I'm just the ref!

JACKIE

Kyle! Stop! Please!

JACKIE (CONT'D)

Is that true, Mike?

MIKE

Yeah, it is.

JACKIE

So why'd you move him if he wanted

to stay here.

MIKE

Because it would have been too much

work to leave him here. I couldn't

have done it.

JACKIE

Then you shouldn't have taken him.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 111

CONTINUED:

MIKE

I had to, alright?

JACKIE

Why?!

MIKE

Because I needed the money! We

needed the money.

JACKIE

You moved an old man out of his

house to make money? Have you lost

your freaking mind?

MIKE

No! I just didn't think it would

get this complicated.

JACKIE

Really? Or you just didn't think

you'd get caught?

This stops Mike in his tracks. He can't answer. Jackie turns

and walks away.

MIKE

Jack! Jack, where are you going?

JACKIE

Home!

She walks away.

Stemler is sleeping on one couch. Kyle on the other. Kyle's

cell phone rings. He wakes up and checks it. He answers it.

KYLE

Hello. Hello. Mom?

She's not there. He hangs up. Kyle starts to put on his

shoes.

STEMLER

Did your mom just crank call you?

KYLE

No.

CONTINUED:

STEMLER

So you and Coach Mike get in a

fight because you lost?

KYLE

No. We got in a fight because he's

an asshole.

STEMLER

Really?

KYLE

Yeah, really, Stem.

STEMLER

Well I'm sure he'll make it up to

you, bro. You're the best wrestler

he's ever had. I mean he's always

been cool to me and I suck.

MIKE

Hey Leo.

LEO

Hi.

MIKE

I fell asleep. I'm sorry.

LEO

Sorry for what?

MIKE

You want to go home?

LEO

Yeah.

CONTINUED:

JACKIE

Hi.

MIKE

Hi. Is he here?

JACKIE

No. He slept at Stemler's. How

about you?

MIKE

Oak Knoll.

(BEAT)

You're right, that's not who I am.

JACKIE

So what are you going to do?

MIKE

I have to go court.

JACKIE

You can't. You told the Judge you

were keeping Leo at home.

MIKE

I know.

JACKIE

So then tell her you changed your

mind. No one can question that.

MIKE

I can't, Jack.

JACKIE

Why not?

MIKE

Because it's not true.

JACKIE

Well I'm glad your done lying now,

just in time to lose your practice.

That's how we survive, Mike. Your

family. You ever think of that?

MIKE

Yeah. All the time.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 114

CONTINUED:

JACKIE

Shit.

MIKE

I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.

JACKIE

I know.

JACKIE

Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here?

KYLE

The window.

JACKIE

Are you hungry? I was gonna make

some pancakes.

KYLE

No. I'm leaving. I just came to get

my shit.

MIKE

Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say

I'm sorry...

KYLE

I know, Mike, you're sorry.

Everyone's always sorry.

MIKE

I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And

I'm gonna fight to keep him there.

KYLE

It's too late. You'll lose. My

mother's gonna take him.

5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 115

CONTINUED:

MIKE

Maybe but I'm still gonna try.

KYLE

So what?! You want me to forgive

you now? Is that it, Mike?!

MIKE

No. I just want you to give me

another chance. That's all I'm

asking.

KYLE

This is bullshit!

MIKE

Hey, Kyle, listen -

KYLE

I want to be alone.

MIKE

What?

KYLE

(Without looking at them)

I JUST WANT TO BE DOWN HERE ALONE!

MIKE

OK. All right. Yeah.

JACKIE

Kyle, I just wanna say - we love

you.

Hi Eleanor.

ELEANOR

Can I talk to you?

MIKE

ELEANOR

You know the transcript alone is

enough to hang you.

MIKE

Yeah, well, we'll see what happens.

ELEANOR

Shame on you counselor.

MIKE

Is that it?

ELEANOR

No. My client would like to talk to

you.

MIKE

Hi Cindy.

CINDY

Hi. Is your deal still available?

MIKE

What about Kyle?

MIKE

We will.

CINDY

I want to say goodbye.
