HEATHER (O.S.)

You hear about your ex?

ALLISON (O.S.)

Jerry?

HEATHER

Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to

Middletown. He left this morning.

ALLISON

No way.   How do you know?

HEATHER

Carter said. He got some job at some

company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.

ALLISON

Doesn't sound so bad.

HEATHER

I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.

ALLISON

I don't want to go to a baseball game.

You're going with Derek anyway.

HEATHER

Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek

told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by

myself.

3

ALLISON

I thought Adam was hurt.

HEATHER

I wish.

BRAD

(banging on the window

pane)

Hey! Jimmy!

BRAD (CONT'D)

Finally!

JIMMY

Office hours are nine to five.

MEGAN

You have a lot of credit card bills in

there, Jimmy.

JIMMY

(holding his hand out for

the Mail)

I know.

MEGAN

You're not mad that we're stopping by like

this?

JIMMY

It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I

gotta go to work.

4

MEGAN

(explaining to Amy)

Jimmy's got like, six jobs.

BRAD

Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for

nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby

Bales is askin' about you?

JIMMY

Askin'?   Like how?

BRAD

Like how you owe him money on the Dallas

fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and

you haven't been returnin' his calls.

JIMMY

How you hear this?

BRAD

Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer

on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out-

of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man.

Goddam.

JIMMY

(unconvincing)

It ain't nothin'. He's just makin'

conversation.

BRAD

It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's

gonna make a playground outta your asshole

like he's back in the joint, and it ain't

nothin'? And you heard all the stories I

heard, about that horse-cock, and how he

can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it

too, like when he whipped it out at

Tomlinson's party...

JIMMY

Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a

little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me,

that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes

to me. It's fine.

BRAD

Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.

5

JIMMY

Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do

this thing. I got work.

COREY

Nice.

PEDRO

Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.

COREY

Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in

Athens that's just dirty.

PEDRO

Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.

COREY

At least I'm paid to be here.

COREY (CONT'D)

Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.

EMILY'S VOICE

It's me.

COREY

Emily?

EMILY'S VOICE

Some other girl would be calling you?

6

COREY

How'd you get this number?

EMILY'S VOICE

Don't you work there?

COREY

What do you want?

EMILY'S VOICE

I need you to come pick me up.

COREY

Are you kidding? Where are you?

EMILY'S VOICE

At home.

COREY

What for?

EMILY'S VOICE

Just because. I need to stay with you for

a couple days.

COREY

Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water.

Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd

be miserable like us. What for anyway?

EMILY'S VOICE

It's no big deal. Just come pick me up.

COREY

Fine, forget it then.

EMILY'S VOICE

Corey, come on! How many times have I

called you since you left? I wouldn't

ask, except I don't have anywhere to go.

Please.

COREY

Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay

in our little dump, fine.

EMILY'S VOICE

Fine.   Thanks, then.

7

JINA

Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie

right now?

JINA (CONT'D)

Did you get my message?

ANSWERING MACHINE

(electronic voice)

You have one new message.

(Jina's voice)

Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say

happy birthday, since you'll be gone when

I get home. I'm driving your sister to

school and I'm leaving the car for her, so

I'll be taking the train back.

8

ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)

By the way, you should call your sister

and stop this not-talking nonsense.

ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)

Anyway, I know how you hate long messages,

so I'll see you tomorrow...

JESSICA

That's fucking bullshit.

JINA

Here we go again.

JESSICA

What about my car?!

JINA

Jessica, your sister got into beauty

school, and she's going. Now I've got

about two hours sleep before I have to

drive her all the way the hell up there.

JESSICA

Yeah, I heard that.

JINA

Jess, you're still living here for free.

JESSICA

On the couch!

JINA

Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs

it. Can't you be happy for your sister?

JESSICA

Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car,

and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a

favor and tell her how fucking happy I am

for her.

JINA

If you're going to be like this, I'm just

going to bed.

9

RON (O.S.)

Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine?

JIMMY

Yeah.

RON

Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright?

I gotta let you go. I can't afford two

employees.

JIMMY

So you're keeping Melinda?

RON

Yeah.

JIMMY

Ron, that is totally fucked!   I been here

way longer than her!

RON

Yeah, but I'm running a business.

There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause

she works here.

10

JIMMY

But she doesn't do anything! She just

sits at the front desk all day.

RON

I know that.

JIMMY

Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine,

she'll look at you cross-eyed.

RON

I can't afford two employees, and she

attracts business. That's it.

JIMMY

Fucking great. Thanks.

RON

Jimmy, don't take it personal. If you

were built like her I'd keep you.

RON (CONT'D)

Bales.

BOBBY

So where you been?

JIMMY

What are you talkin' about?   Nowhere.   I

been working.

BOBBY

So you just don't return my phone calls.

JIMMY

Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so

what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on

Indy tonight.

11

BOBBY

I can't take any more of your bets.   I

look like a spineless fucking fag.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

What the hell am I supposed to do with you

Jimmy? People are talkin'.

JIMMY

I know they're talkin'!

BOBBY

You don't know a fuckin' thing. Come by

my apartment tonight, we'll figure this

out.

JIMMY

I ain't like that.

BOBBY

Ain't like what?

JIMMY

Nothin'.

BOBBY

You don't know what I know.   You'll see.

JIMMY

I'm working tonight.

BOBBY

Jimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin'

like a fool all on account 'a you. You

owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of

it.

12

PETE

Is she alright?

COREY

She fainted.

LIFEGUARD

Alright, I'm calling 911.    Everybody stay

out of the pool.

PETE

Alright, well, quit horsing around. The

Blandino's had a break-in. There's glass

all over the patio.

COREY

That's Jerry's unit.

PETE

Jerry moved to Middletown.

COREY

He quit?

PETE

He left a message. You gotta take care of

all his stuff now, too.

COREY

Aw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow!

I told you I got community service!

PETE

So you're gonna have to get everything

done today then. Get going.

LIFEGUARD (O.S.)

Keith, I told you to clear the pool!

13

KATIE

Doesn't Carlos want his car back?

JESSICA

He's letting me borrow it.

KATIE

Well then why were you late if you had his

car?

JESSICA

I slept late.

KATIE

Were you drinking last night?

JESSICA

No.   But thanks for asking.

KATIE

Were you doing drugs?

JESSICA

Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.

KATIE

And you're not a loser.

JESSICA

And neither are you.

KATIE

But it's okay to drink.

JESSICA

When you're older it'll be okay.

KATIE

How old are you?

JESSICA

Old enough.

KATIE

But you're not twenty-one yet. The law

says you have to be twenty-one.

JESSICA

Katie, can you not ask so many questions

today? I've got too much to think about.

14

KATIE

Cause it's your birthday?

JESSICA

Yes.

KATIE

Happy Birthday!

JESSICA

Thank you.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.

KATIE

I will.

ALLISON

(pointing)

Turn left at the light.

15

LIFEGUARD

She's in here.

HARRY

(to Bystanders)

Can you give us some room, please?

HARRY (CONT'D)

(looking up to Heather)

She's breathing.

HARRY (CONT'D)

(to Lifeguard)

What happened?

LIFEGUARD

I'm not sure. She just passed out, right

where you see her.

HARRY

Did you see her eat anything?

LIFEGUARD

Uh-uh.

HEATHER

I know her.

ALLISON

Yeah?    How?

16

HEATHER

When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked

him.

ALLISON

How do you know?

HEATHER

She started dating Steve right after we

broke up. I mean right after. I asked

him if there was another girl, and he

never answered. He couldn't answer,

because he was fucking that slut.

ALLISON

That doesn't mean they fucked.

HARRY

Alright, she ain't comin' around.

HARRY (CONT'D)

(instinctively)

Whoa, easy.

HEATHER

(without looking up)

I know what I'm doing.

17

HARRY

Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?

HEATHER

We'll get there.

ALLISON

You don't even know for sure if she slept

with Steve!

HEATHER

Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can

fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for

her slut ass!

ALLISON

(pleading)

Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!   We gotta

hurry!

HEATHER

I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss

my ass!

(to Victim)

You hear me, you fucking bitch?!

18

PIZZA POP

(heavy Italian accent)

Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here

'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?

JIMMY

Nah. I'm gonna start early, if that's

alright. I could use the cash.

PIZZA POP

Still paying offa those credit cards, eh

Jimmy? I told you them things are-a

trouble.

(calling into the back)

Sweetheart! Don't a worry about that!

Jimmy's a here and he's a gonna take care

of it!

PIZZA MOM

(smiling)

Hey-a Jimmy!

JESSICA

Hello?

CARLOS (O.S.)

Where the hell are you?

19

JESSICA

Carlos?

CARLOS

Why weren't you answering your phone?!

You were supposed to bring my car back

last night!

JESSICA'S VOICE

Yeah.     Sorry.

CARLOS

You bringing it or what?        I need it for

work!

JESSICA'S VOICE

Not 'til this afternoon.

CARLOS

What the hell, Jess?!        You said I'd have

it last night!

JESSICA'S VOICE

Alright, relax, I'll bring it.

CARLOS

Dammit!     Where are you?

JESSICA'S VOICE

I'm getting on the Parkway.

CARLOS

What the hell?!

JESSICA'S VOICE

What's the matter?

CARLOS

Jess, you just passed me!        In my car!

20

CARLOS (CONT'D)

Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my

car!

CARLOS (CONT'D)

Jess, I know you're coming back here. I

know you're not leaving me standing here.

JESSICA

Sorry.

JESSICA

I would have brought the car back, but I

need it.

CARLOS

So you ask.

JESSICA

I said I'm sorry.

CARLOS

Yeah right. And why the hell are you

still driving?

JESSICA

Fine.

CARLOS

Where's the squirt?

JESSICA

At my place watching TV.

21

CARLOS

You left her alone?

JESSICA

Just for a minute. I left my novel at

Aaron's.

CARLOS

You need it now? Aren't you supposed to

be watching her?

JESSICA

Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm

just gonna get through these last few

weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did

a good thing, and some other moron can

take a turn being her big sister.

CARLOS

Don't know why you wanted another sister

when you hate the one you got.

JESSICA

What're you up to?

CARLOS

Guess who stopped by.

JESSICA

Who?

CARLOS

Guess.

JESSICA

Mary Lynn.

CARLOS

Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she

is.

JESSICA

Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a

shot. She's probably one of those

personality girls.

CARLOS

Yeah, what you know about personality?

22

JESSICA

I bet she'll give it up right away.

CARLOS

Now that's something you know about.

JESSICA

You should go for it.   Drain them pipes.

CARLOS

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

JIMMY

(into his cell phone)

Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in

the area so I'm stopping by a little

early. See you in a little while.

23

DEREK

Whoa.

(returning to the Sports

Section)

Slow down, there, buddy.

DEREK (CONT'D)

Yeah?

HEATHER

Are you seeing anybody else?

DEREK

Hello?

HEATHER

(louder)

Hello?! Are you seeing anybody else?!

DEREK

No.

HEATHER

You're not cheating on me?

DEREK

No.

HEATHER

Be honest.

DEREK

You're startin' to annoy me.

HEATHER

You're fucking annoying me!

DEREK

(dismissive)

Fine.

HEATHER

Don't you hang up!

24

DEREK

Then calm down. You told me to tell you

when you're in one of your moods? Well

guess what?

HEATHER

See?     That asshole's cheating.

ALLISON

Just because he won't move in with you

doesn't mean he's cheating.

HEATHER

Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does

- he cheats. Now it's my turn just like

all the others.

HEATHER (CONT'D)

Let's go.

ALLISON

Where?

JESSICA

You coming in?

CARLOS

No, but tell asshole I said hello.

JESSICA

See ya.

25

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Aaron here?

PITT

No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you.

JESSICA

Shit.     I left my novel here.

PITT

You got no idea why he's lookin' for you,

do you?

JESSICA

What're you talkin' about?

PITT

You been fuckin' around.

JESSICA

No I haven't.

PITT

Well, someone did somethin', cause Aaron

caught somethin' an' he ain't happy about

it.

JESSICA

He caught somethin'?     What the hell did he

catch?

PITT

Wouldn't say. Just said that he ain't

been with anyone, so it musta been you.

JESSICA

Shit.

PITT

You humped someone, didn't you?

JESSICA

I didn't do shit.

PITT

Well it musta been the immaculate

infection, 'cuz he got somethin'.     He's

lookin' fer you.

26

JESSICA

Shit, shit...

PITT

Yeah, you did it.

JESSICA

Fuck you, Pitt.

PEDRO

Hey, mehn.

COREY

What're you doing back?

PEDRO

I got your sister.

(forming breasts with his

hands)

She got big.

COREY

That's my little sister.

PEDRO

She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima.

COREY

Just take her back to our place!

PEDRO

I can't because we got no place.   We got

thrown out.

COREY

He threw us out?!

PEDRO

Si! And all our shit's still in there!

And Pancho, too!

COREY

That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just

lock us out!

27

PEDRO

Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go

find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked!

COREY

Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like,

ask him to take you back.

PEDRO

No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr.

Cocksucker's address.

COREY

What for?

PEDRO

I take care of this.

COREY

Don't do anything that'll get us into

trouble.

PEDRO

Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't

worry about this. I talk to him. But

first I take care of business.

PEDRO (CONT'D)

Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar.

28

JIMMY

Saw your cat outside.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

I gotta get back to work. I got more pies

in the car.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Car?

29

JIMMY

(over the wind and music)

Yeah, it's Jimmy!

MATT (O.S.)

(barely audible)

Hey Jimmy, it's Matt. I need some K.

JIMMY

Matt?!   Speak up, man, I can barely hear

you!

MATT

(semi-whispering)

I need some K, dude. I need it for

tonight.

JIMMY

(still rolling up the

window)

What?!

MATT

(semi-whispering)

Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home!

I need some K, dude!

30

JIMMY

Alright, alright! I got it, man,      got

plenty! I'll see you tonight!

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Yeah, it's Jimmy!

MATT

Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need

one a' your special deliveries - I won't

be around tonight!

JIMMY

Alright, man, when do you need it?!

MATT

Like, now, dude! For tonight!     I'm taking

off!

JIMMY

Matt, you're way out of the way, man!

Wait for another delivery.

MATT

Look, I need it now, man!     Now now now!

I'm takin' off!

JIMMY

What's the rush?!

MATT

(finally confiding)

Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a

friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang

her easy if I had some K.

JIMMY

Really?!

MATT

Easy, dude, easy.    Setzer's words - it's

in the bag.

31

JIMMY

Jesus!

DAVE

Jimmy?

(still dazed, but

immediately friendly)

Hey, what's up, man?

JIMMY

Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was

talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the

stop sign, I guess.

DAVE

Don't sweat it.

(regarding his Car)

I could give a shit about this thing. I

was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or

somethin' hit me.

JIMMY

Holy shit, man, is she alright?

32

DAVE

She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that

hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.

JIMMY

What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta

get her to a hospital.

DAVE

Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a

problems if we do that. Cops, insurance

and whatnot. You probably got drugs on

you...

JIMMY

Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's

bleedin' all over the place!

DAVE

Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of

it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.

JIMMY

That's retarded.

DAVE

See?   I told ya.

JIMMY

Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling

911. Look at the blood!

DAVE

Put that shit away. I'll take her home

and give her some K, she'll be fine.

JIMMY

She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K

gonna do?

DAVE

Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy

like you should be avoidin' that kinda'

attention.

33

JIMMY

You should take better care of your girl.

DAVE

Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through

all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam

whore. She's a whore.

FEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.)

Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!

DAVE

See, she's fine.

JIMMY

Holy shit. You're fucked up.

(seeing an opportunity)

Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?

DAVE

No, man, I'm good.

JIMMY

You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha'

stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast,

you can sell it to your crackhead friends

whenever.

DAVE

You been placin' bets with Bobby the

Bookie again?

JIMMY

No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty

percent on my cards and shit, and it

drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my

money away.

DAVE

Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?

JIMMY

You want it?

DAVE

Look, I'm definitely interested in a

little bit for myself, definitely, but I

ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think

about it.

JIMMY

Hey, your nose is bleedin'.

34

DAVE

Seriously?

JIMMY

No, just horsin' around.

DAVE

Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head

up and shit.

JIMMY

Yeah.

(regarding Dave's Car)

Sorry, man.

DAVE

Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.

COREY (O.S.)

You smoke?!

EMILY

Yeah, so?     You do drugs.

COREY

How would you know?

EMILY

Everybody knows my brother does drugs.

COREY

So you heard about that thing that

happened?

EMILY

Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too.

COREY

If you think so highly of me, what the

hell are you doing here?

35

EMILY

I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put

everything back in the house?

COREY

We ran outta of gas. We were right

outside his house - what the hell else

were we supposed to do? He wasn't

supposed to be home for another hour. At

least he took it easy on us.

EMILY

(changing the subject)

Here, I brought this.

COREY

What for?

EMILY

Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left

it. I brought it for you.

COREY

Keep it.     I don't wear hats.

EMILY

I don't want it.

COREY

You go to see him at all?

EMILY

In prison?     No, not lately.

COREY

So what's the problem?     Vincent hitting

you?

EMILY

Vincent?    Vincent's gone.   She's on Victor

now.

COREY

What happened to Vincent?

EMILY

He found out about Victor.

36

PEDRO (O.S.)

(to Corey)

Vamos, I need the address!     I have a pen

in the truck!

COREY

So is Victor hitting you or what?

EMILY

No.

COREY

What then?

EMILY

I don't wanna talk about it.     Forget it.

PEDRO

(to Corey)

Hurry up, mehn!

EMILY

You know he has porno magazines all over

his truck.

COREY

So?

COREY (CONT'D)

Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright?

KEVIN

It's a moped.

COREY

Just lay off it.

PEDRO

Gracias.

37

PEDRO (CONT'D)

Oye, don't get mad, but would you be mad

if I try to fuck your sister?

COREY

If you think you can.

PEDRO

Maybe you think you can talk to her for

me?

COREY

Pedro, she's fifteen!

PEDRO

No way, mehn.

(forming breasts with his

hands)

No con esas tetas.

COREY

I'll have you sent to jail, man.     I'm

serious.

PEDRO

No way she is fifteen.     She looks way

older.

COREY

She'll look a lot younger on the witness

stand, with my mom sitting in the

courtroom.

PEDRO

Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.     I call

you soon.

COREY

So what're you gonna do?

PEDRO

I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say,

"Look, mehn, let us into our fucking

home."

38

COREY

Wait a second... Why are you still

driving this thing? I thought you got

fired.

PEDRO

Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna

drive without my truck. They fired me,

mehn.

ALLISON

I hate this job.

HEATHER

I should pick up one of them assholes.

ALLISON

Don't you have an appointment with Dr.

Cook?

HEATHER

Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it.

ALLISON

Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with

your doctor. There's nothing wrong with

you.

HEATHER

(holding the lower

portion of her right

ribcage)

Ally, I have a pain right here that has

nothing to do with my head. My dad died

of heart disease, and if that asshole

taught me anything, it's better to be

paranoid than dead.

39

HEATHER (CONT'D)

That's her.   Tess.

ALLISON

You're just guessing.

HEATHER

Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type,

too. That little slut.

ALLISON

Harry's waiting.

HEATHER

Sorry if I snapped.

ALLISON

You didn't snap.

HEATHER

I mean this morning.

ALLISON

Oh.   That's okay.

HEATHER

I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole

thing all over again with Derek, and then

I've got to find some other asshole, and

do it all again. I'm sick of the whole

cycle.

ALLISON

So do something different.

HEATHER

I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.

40

JESSICA

Yeah, where are you?

CARLOS' VOICE

Right down the street, gettin' some more

nachos.

JESSICA

Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry

up.

TROY

Holy shit.

JESSICA

Aaron, I don't know how the hell you

got...

AARON

(interrupting)

Fucking bitch!

PITT

(to Jessica)

Use the back door, yo!

AARON

(to Pitt)

Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!

PITT

I don't want to see you be hittin' no

girl. Just calm your ass down.

AARON

Fuck you!

41

TROY

He's gonna kill her.

AARON

Where you goin', bitch?!

JESSICA

Drive!

CARLOS

(starting the Car)

What's the deal?

CARLOS (CONT'D)

What the fuck!

JESSICA

Fucking drive!

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Fuck you!

AARON

Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!

AARON (CONT'D)

You like that, bitch?! Huh?!

42

JESSICA

Oh my God, my fucking eyes!

CARLOS

Jesus, look at my car, Jess!

JESSICA

That fucking... asshole!

CARLOS

Now I'm screwed too.

JESSICA

(practically sobbing)

I'm so sorry.

MR. CARSON

Pedro? What're you doing here?    Get the

hell off my porch.

43

PEDRO

Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking

apartment.

MR. CARSON

Either pay me or get off my porch.

MR. CARSON (CONT'D)

Pedro!   What the hell are you doing?!

PEDRO

I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.

MR. CARSON

Let it down right now you psychotic

sonuvabitch!

PEDRO

Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!

MR. CARSON

Pay the damn rent!

PEDRO

I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired!

MR. CARSON

Bullshit! You never pay rent, and I know

you've had a job! I'm sicka' this shit!

Put down my car, or I'm callin' the cops

to haul your ass outta here!

PEDRO

Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not

needed.

MR. CARSON

I'm done with it. Let my car down.

PEDRO

I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.

MR. CARSON

Margaret wants you out of the house

anyway. Now let my car down.

44

PEDRO

You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let

her slap you around?!

MR. CARSON

Nobody slaps nobody around.

PEDRO

Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay

rent, I always hear her slapping your ass

around.

MR. CARSON

I'm going inside to get the phone. If

you're still here when I come back out I'm

gonna dial the police with you standing

right here next to me.

MATT

Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go

here! Where the hell were you?!

JIMMY

I got into a freakin' accident!

MATT

Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make

me come all the way out here! I been

waitin'!

JIMMY

Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember

who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got

shit I gotta do!

45

MATT

(about to blow, then

controls himself)

Fine, fine! Just give it to me.

JIMMY

I didn't want to bring my bag to your

house, with your fuckin' parents home.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Where's my Grand Theft Auto?

MATT

I lent it to Jerry.

JIMMY

What'd you do that for?    Get it back.

MATT

He moved down the shore.    This morning.

JIMMY

Alright, sixty bucks.

MATT

What?   Fer one freakin' jar?!

JIMMY

Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I

told you this shit, I told you.

MATT

You said extra, I thought you meant, like,

fifty!

JIMMY

Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin'

price!

MATT

This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm

meetin' this chick, so you jack up the

price!

JIMMY

Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin'

way out here, and I said I'd charge you

extra. I don't give a shit if its ten

over the regular price, or twenty-five

over your fuckin' "discount price," but

you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar.

46

MATT

(weakly)

Man, what the hell.

(looks in his Wallet)

I need some cash for food and drinks, man!

I'm takin' this girl out!

JIMMY

(considering)

Gimme fifty even.

MATT

C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can

get! What if she wants to go somewhere?!

And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!

JIMMY

(breaking)

Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Here, man, go fuckin' get high.

MATT

(almost apologetic)

See ya.

PEDRO'S VOICE

He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't

let us back in.

COREY

That's great.

PEDRO

Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn.

47

PEDRO (CONT'D)

Hello?

PETE

Corey.

PETE (CONT'D)

The Blandinos just called again.   The

broken glass is still there.

ROB'S VOICE

(via the Payphone)

Hello?

PETE

And the grass needs to be cut.

COREY

(hurriedly to Pete)

Okay, I'll take care of it.

PETE

(sarcastic)

Don't forget to put gas in it.

COREY

Rob?     It's Corey Becker.

ROB'S VOICE

Hey.

COREY

You got any spare cash?

KID #1

Corey!     Hey Corey!

48

KID #1 (CONT'D)

Gorski says he can beat you!

COREY

Maybe he can.

KID #1

Yeah right! Get over here and whip his

ass real quick!

KID #1 (CONT'D)

(shouting after him)

Aw, c'mon! Corey!

HEATHER

Are you comin' with me to register

tomorrow?

ALLISON

I dunno.

HEATHER

Why not?

ALLISON

My brother spent six thousand on tech

courses and he's still painting houses.

HEATHER

(looking at her watch)

I'm gonna be late.

ALLISON

Why don't you just reschedule?

HEATHER

You know how booked he always is. I don't

wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I

don't trust women doctors.

ALLISON

Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.

49

HEATHER

Ally, I'm really feeling something. A

deep ache, like someone's crushing me.

This can't wait.

ALLISON

You still feel like going out?

HEATHER

Hell yes.

JIMMY

Yeah, its Jimmy.

PIZZA POP'S VOICE

Hey-a Jimmy! Where are you?! We got two

calls from 45 Smith Street wondering where

their food is!

JIMMY

(over the wind noise)

I got into an accident!

PIZZA POP'S VOICE

An accident?! Are you okay, Jimmy?!

JIMMY

I'm fine!    My car's banged up, but I'm on

my way!

PIZZA POP'S VOICE

Okay!    Drive careful!

JIMMY

Yeah!

50

JIMMY (CONT'D)

Hello?

KWON'S VOICE

Jimmy?

JIMMY

Who is this?

KWON

You don't have caller ID?

JIMMY

I'm driving.    Who is this?

KWON

Kwon.

JIMMY

Hey, Kwon.     What's up?   Where are you?

KWON

I'm on my cousin's phone.

JIMMY

Where's Car?

KWON

He's right here. He said you guys were

supposed to meet.

JIMMY

He did? Well, yeah, I stopped by this

morning. Nobody was there.

KWON

You didn't come in?

JIMMY

No.     Nobody answered the door.

51

KWON

Well, you want to come by now? I'll be

here. You can make your pick-up.

JIMMY

Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the

other side of town.

KWON

Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop

by and get your shit.

JIMMY

I can't.   What's the big deal?

KWON

Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a

shitload 'a shit missing from our house.

JIMMY

Car?

KWON

What do you think?

JIMMY

I don't know.

KWON

I want you to come over here and tell me

everything that happened when you stopped

by.

JIMMY

Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no

one answered.

KWON

You didn't ring the doorbell?

JIMMY

That's what I meant.

KWON

And no one answered.

52

JIMMY

No.     No one answered.

KWON

You left a message on our house phone this

morning. Why didn't you call our cells

when you got here?

JIMMY

(stumped)

Why didn't I call.     Good question.

KWON

What the fuck do I care, you think it's a

good question?! Are you fucking kidding

me?!

JIMMY

Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta

shit on my mind right now.

KWON

Jimmy, do you have my drugs?

JIMMY

No.

KWON

Alright.     If you hear anything, you call

me.

JIMMY

I will.     Sorry about Car.

KWON

Thanks, Jimmy.

53

JIMMY

(generally to the other

drivers)

Fuck off!

ROB

I'll take it.

AARON

(to Troy)

C'mon, let's go find her.

TROY

I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside

lookin' fer her.

AARON

Gimme yer keys.

PITT

(to Troy)

Don't give him your keys.

54

AARON

(to Pitt)

You want a smack? I am seriously gonna

smack yer ass.

PITT

Don't give me no attitude, just cause you

got mushrooms growin' on your balls.

AARON

(to Troy)

Let's go, man.

(re Pitt)

Fuck this asshole.

TROY

No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin'

Jess neither.

PITT

Dominoes.

(a beat, then to Aaron)

It's her.

AARON'S VOICE

Jess, come back here.

JESSICA

Yeah right.

AARON

Jess, I'm serious.      We need to talk about

this.

JESSICA

Isn't that what we're doing?

AARON

Fine!   Who'd you fuck?

55

JESSICA

Nobody.

AARON

Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my

dick, and I never cheated!

JESSICA

Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have

anything.

AARON

Why don't we go to the doctor and get you

checked out?

JESSICA

I can go to the doctor by myself.     And if

I have it, I got it from you!

AARON

You're fuckin' fulla shit!

JESSICA

Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm

gonna find someone to kick your ass. I

mean it.

AARON

I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause

it's probably the same dude you been

bangin' behind my back!

JESSICA

I never cheated.

AARON

Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.

CARLOS

(anxious)

What's up?

JESSICA

He's pissed.    Says he's gonna kick our

asses.

CARLOS

Great.    I got a baseball bat in the trunk.

56

JESSICA

Good.

CARLOS

I gotta go to work in an hour.

JESSICA

Call in sick.

CARLOS

Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said

you were gonna find someone to kick his

ass?

JESSICA

Yeah.

CARLOS

Who?

JESSICA

You don't know him. He graduated before

us.

CARLOS

He a big dude?

JESSICA

(still staring out the

window)

Not really, but he gets into fights all

the time, at parties and stuff. And he

knows a lot of people.

CARLOS

Call him.

JESSICA

I'd rather go over in person.

CARLOS

Why?

57

JESSICA

(not exactly confident)

I can be more... persuasive in person.

CARLOS

(disappointed)

Swell.

KATIE'S VOICE

Hello, this is Katie Kinney!

JESSICA

Katie, it's Jessica.

KATIE'S VOICE

Where are you?

JESSICA

Have you eaten?

KATIE'S VOICE

I'm starving!

JESSICA

Okay, I'm going to be home in a little

bit, okay?

KATIE'S VOICE

Alright.

JESSICA

Drive.

58

COREY

Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.

COREY (CONT'D)

Can you let us back into our apartment

now?

MR. CARSON

This is only one month.   You boys owe

three.

COREY

That's all we have. We'll give you the

rest later, as soon as we can.

MR. CARSON

When you get me the rest, I'll let you

back in.

COREY

Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just

temporary. Pedro lost his job.

MR. CARSON

Bullshit. You're always late. You should

spend less time trying to rob houses, and

more time working.

COREY

Aren't you supposed to take us to court

before you throw us out?

MRS. CARSON (O.S.)

Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door

already you stupid bastard! You're

letting the cold air out!

MR. CARSON

(suddenly in a hurry)

Tell it to my lawyer.

COREY

Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're

doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!

MRS. CARSON (O.S.)

Shut the goddam door!

MR. CARSON

Three months!

59

COREY

(banging on the door)

C'mon!

OLDER MAN

Hey, can I park here?

PEDRO

(very friendly)

Si, si, of course.

(motioning toward the

Mustang)

The transmission is broke.   Transmissions

on these cars suck.

OLDER WOMAN

(pointing)

Oh, and the tire's flat, too.

PEDRO

Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's

fine, believe me.

60

OLDER MAN

Good luck.

PEDRO

Gracias!

DR. COOK

Breathe out.

DR. COOK (CONT'D)

It's official. You're as healthy as you

were last week, and last week you were as

healthy as an ox.

HEATHER

Are you sure you're using that thing

right? I feel this ache

(indicating her chest)

Right here, like I'm being crushed between

two boards.

DR. COOK

Nobody's crushing you.     Honest. I'm sure.

It's all in your head.     I know a couple

quacks...

HEATHER

I don't need a head doctor!

DR. COOK

I was just kidding there.

61

DR. COOK (CONT'D)

Heather, if you're going to insist on

ignoring my rules, at least put your

blouse on before you light up.

HEATHER

Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is

that so outrageous?!

DR. COOK

Heather...

HEATHER

I just don't want to be walking around

tomorrow and drop dead because my heart

collapses, and so that makes me weird or

paranoid...

DR. COOK

Heather, there's nothing wrong with being

concerned about your health. Please put

your blouse back on.

DR. COOK (CONT'D)

So I'll see you next week then.

HEATHER

(suddenly friendly again)

Okay, yeah, see you next week.

ALLISON

I'm two pounds heavier I think.

62

DEREK

Sorry.

ALLISON

It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that

was kinda worse than I thought. Does

Heather... like it?

DEREK

She never let's me do it.

ALLISON

She doesn't?    Why not?

DEREK

I don't know. She does shave though.    How

come you don't shave?

ALLISON

I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you

love her?

DEREK

I don't know.

ALLISON

How can you not know?

DEREK

She's got problems.

ALLISON

I don't understand you. Why do you even

cheat on her with me? She's so pretty.

So much prettier than me.

DEREK

She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I

don't   know why you do it. You should have

a man   of your own - we say it all the

time,   me and Heather.

ALLISON

Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather

introduced me to last time?

DEREK

He outranks me. He's a good guy.

63

ALLISON

Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I

can do is a guy that looks like that?

DEREK

No.

ALLISON

You must think so. You tried to set me up

with him.

DEREK

I thought it was a bad match.     It was

Heather's idea.

ALLISON

So she thinks I can't do better.

DEREK

You know what she thinks better than me.

ALLISON

Let's get dressed, she'll be here.

DEREK

Let's let her walk in on us, and look

surprised.

ALLISON

Hurry up.

PIZZA POP

Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been?

JIMMY

Around.     Deliverin'.

PIZZA POP

Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We

got more deliveries for you.

64

PIZZA POP (CONT'D)

(into the Phone)

Poppy's!

JESSICA

Did your parents call?

KATIE

Nope!    Where were you?

JESSICA

Out with Carlos.

KATIE

The VCR is broken.

JESSICA

(yelling to Carlos in the

living room)

'Los, are you hungry?!

CARLOS (O.S.)

I guess.

KATIE

Are we going to have TV dinners all

weekend?

JESSICA

No.     I promise. You want some milk?

KATIE

Can I have ice-tea?

JESSICA

Of course.

(to Carlos)

Can you make her some ice-tea?

65

CARLOS

Aren't you gonna eat?

JESSICA

I'm gonna take a shower.

KATIE

Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?

CARLOS

No.

KATIE

I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.

CARLOS

Neither do I.

KATIE

Don't you like Jessica?

CARLOS

Kind of, I guess. She's nice.

HEATHER

Take a look at that paper. There's at

least a half dozen apartments I circled

that would be perfect.

66

DEREK

Yeah?

(beat)

You're joking.

(beat)

Alright, ten minutes.

HEATHER

(guessing at the purpose

of the call, completely

frustrated)

Great.

DEREK

That was Tess. Said I had to come back

in.

HEATHER

Are you fucking Tess?

DEREK

What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see

you at Carter's when I get off.

HEATHER

I'm not dropping this!

DEREK

Since when do you drop anything?

HEATHER

You see that? He practically said yes.

ALLISON

What're you doing?

HEATHER

I'm gonna look through his shit.

67

ALLISON

You're finally flipping, I think.

HEATHER

You're a lot of help, Ally.        Really.

Thanks.

HEATHER (CONT'D)

See?!   See?!

ALLISON

So what.   Condoms.

HEATHER

Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't

used condoms with me for weeks.

ALLISON

So maybe those are left-overs.

HEATHER

Ally, these are not left-overs.        He never

used regular condoms with me.

ALLISON

(caught off guard)

Why not?

HEATHER

Because if he did, he took two fucking

days to come. I always made him wear

ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this

shit.

ALLISON

He took too long for you?

HEATHER

Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie

there like another hour 'till he got off.

I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell

do you think I started on the pill, Ally?

Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.

ALLISON

How would I know?

HEATHER

Well that's why.

(remembering)

Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking

there. That asshole is using

68

(re Condoms)

these things, and not on me.

ALLISON

Just call him and ask him.

HEATHER

No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to

the party, have some fun. When he's all

good and drunk, you're going to ask him

when I'm not around.

ALLISON

Yeah right.

HEATHER

Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and

having fun, and you just work it in on him

real casual, he may slip. He'll never

admit shit to me.

ALLISON

He won't to me either.

HEATHER

Ally!   Just fucking try it!

ALLISON

I don't wanna spy on him for you!

HEATHER

Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it

in my heart, but I want him to admit it,

alright? Before I fucking flush what's

left of this shithole relationship down

the toilet, I want him to admit it.

ALLISON

Fine, I'll see.

HEATHER

Fine.

KWON

Hey, Jimmy.

JIMMY

What's up.

69

KWON

I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take

a ride.

JIMMY

Where?

KWON

Your place.

JIMMY

Can't do it 'til after work.

KWON

You're sitting here on your ass!

JIMMY

I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now.

My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery

guy.

KWON

Is that your piece-of-shit out front?

JIMMY

Yeah.

KWON

Let's check that out.

JIMMY

I told you, I ain't got your shit.

KWON

Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is

a suspect!

KWON (CONT'D)

(regarding the call)

Fuck that. Let's look in your car.

JIMMY

Hey, it's Jimmy.

70

DAVE

Hey man, it's Dave.   I got happy news for

you.

JIMMY

You want the juice?

DAVE

I told ya, I got plenty. But about the

other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your

problem, and I know a guy who could help

you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at

once.

JIMMY

The juice?

DAVE

No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an'

shit. I might know somebody.

JIMMY

(lowering his voice in

case Kwon comes back)

Who?

DAVE

This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me

some fake D-ball once. I tied his

brother's dog to my front bumper and we

talked it out. Turned out to be an okay

guy. I gave him a call and he's

definitely lookin'.

JIMMY

For how much?

DAVE

Well, he's pretty small time, but he's

itchin' to move up a few notches.

JIMMY

He's got money?

DAVE

He talks so much shit it's hard to tell.

You need to talk to him.

71

JIMMY

Gimme his number, man.

JIMMY

Kwon, what the hell are you doing?

KWON

When you off work?

JIMMY

Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty.

SINJIN'S VOICE

Hello?

JIMMY

Is this Sinjin?

SINJIN'S VOICE

Yeah, who's this?

JIMMY

This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend.

SINJIN'S VOICE

Yeah, I know.

PETE

(over the noise of the

lawn mower)

Hey!

72

PETE (CONT'D)

Where the hell have you been!

COREY

I know, Pete. I'm real real sorry. I got

things going on, you wouldn't believe it.

My life is crazy right now.

PETE

You have a job here, Corey!     You can't

just go taking off!

COREY

I know. I'm sorry. I mean, I know, the

Blandino's. I'm going now.

PETE

I already took care of that!

(hopping off the Lawn

Mower)

Just finish up what I'm doing, then take

care of the fertilizer spill in the

utility room.

COREY

Okay, alright, I will.

COREY (CONT'D)

You got your job back?

PEDRO

Que?

COREY

(pointing at the Mustang)

What the hell is that?!

PEDRO

(looking back at the

Mustang)

Ah, el Mustang?

COREY

Yeah!

73

PEDRO

That's our rent, mehn.    We stole it.

COREY

Hey, uh-uh, no way!    I didn't steal

anything!

PEDRO

Don't worry.    We're going to sell it,

mehn.

COREY

Seriously, are you out of your mind?      To

who?!

PEDRO

This guy I know.

COREY

How do ya know he'll even buy it?

PEDRO

Don't worry. He likes Mustangs, mehn.

Vamos, I got a place for us to stay.

COREY

Jesus, Pedro! I told you I wanna stay out

of trouble! I mean, this is big trouble!

PEDRO

No jodas, don't worry about it. I stole

it. But we need rent, mehn. I lost my

job.

PEDRO (CONT'D)

So you in or out?

COREY

Hey, Emily!    Get your stuff!

PEDRO

Asi me gusta, now you're being smart.

EMILY

Where are we going?!

COREY

Just get in the truck!

74

PETE

You done already?

COREY

I got an emergency, Pete. I'll come in

early tomorrow and finish.

PETE

Hey!

COREY

(running out the door)

Sorry!

CARTER

What's up.

ALLISON

Hey Carter.

CARTER

What's up.

75

HEATHER

(busting Carter's chops

with a mocking tone)

What's up.

CARTER

Stay outta my room.

HEATHER

Wanna shot?

CARTER

Later.   I wanna see how crazy it gets.

HEATHER

Skirt.

EMILY

(to Corey, disapproving)

I can't believe you're doing this.

COREY

(aside to Pedro)

Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out

here on the street like this?

PEDRO

(aside to Corey)

Forget about that, mehn.

(referring to Berubi)

76

I'll talk to Berubi. I know what to say

to this guy. Don't worry.

BERUBI

Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang?

PEDRO

Que?    Ah, el Mustang?

BERUBI

Yeah.

PEDRO

Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend.

BERUBI

So you're driving around with his car

hitched to your tow truck?

PEDRO

Bueno, he's a good friend.

BERUBI

Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer.

PEDRO

(to Berubi)

Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?

BERUBI

Kimmock's got couch.

PEDRO

Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We

got thrown out of our home.

BERUBI

You got evicted?

PEDRO

Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk

for my dog, I come back, my keys don't

work, and the cocksucker put an eviction

notice on the door. He didn't even tell

us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck,

Pancho's probably pissing all over the

place, I'm fucked.

77

BERUBI

Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in

Jerry's room. He moved out.

PEDRO

He did?

BERUBI

Don't park there. Park in back.

PEDRO

Si, si.     No problem, mehn.

BERUBI

(to Corey)

What's up, Becker.

CARLOS

Did you know he was having a party?

JESSICA

Let's go.

JESSICA

Wait here a second and let me talk to him.

78

JESSICA (CONT'D)

What're you doing?

JESSICA (CONT'D)

You need a hand?

CARTER

I'm done.

JESSICA

Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.

CARTER

Those were Jerry's anyway.

JESSICA

Oh. You didn't tell me that.     Is he

pissed?

CARTER

Who gives a shit? He moved out.

JESSICA

Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.

CARTER

I gotta wash my hands.

79

JESSICA

I got a problem.

CARTER

Yeah.

JESSICA

It's Aaron, that asshole.   He's pissed at

me.

CARTER

So what am I, a goddam marriage counselor?

JESSICA

No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it

again.

CARTER

He hit you?

JESSICA

Yes.

CARTER

Like, he slapped you?

JESSICA

No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch

'a times.

CARTER

Why?    What'd you do?

JESSICA

I didn't do shit.

CARTER

Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night.

Tell me what happened. None 'a your

bullshit.

JESSICA

Aaron thinks I cheated on him.

CARTER

Why's he think that?

JESSICA

It doesn't matter.

80

CARTER

Fine.

JESSICA

Alright, alright. He caught something -

he got a rash or something. He says I

gave it to him.

CARTER

He's got a rash?! Are you fuckin' kiddin'

me?! What the hell'd he catch?! Fuckin'

herpes?!

JESSICA

Carter!

CARTER

What the hell'd you give him?!

JESSICA

Nothing! He's fulla shit!    I did not

cheat on him!

CARTER

Fuckin' A!   You slept with me, like, three

weeks ago!

JESSICA

That was the only time, that once, and

there's no way he knows.

CARTER

And you have something?!

JESSICA

No! Are you fucking listening to me?!

And you wore a condom anyway! What the

fuck do you care!

CARTER

Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.      And

I'm sure I'm the only one.

JESSICA

Look, don't even get into the cheating

thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still.

Don't call me the slut.

81

CARTER

Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you.

I'm through with that bullshit.

JESSICA

Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron.

Just help me this one last time, that's

it.

CARTER

He's probably gonna be here tonight,

Aaron.

JESSICA

You're kidding. You barely even know who

he is!

CARTER

No, but I know Troy real good. He said

he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin'

against Aaron, so I said "what the hell."

JESSICA

Look, can you just kick his ass for me?

Please?

CARTER

Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no

friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work

this shit out?

JESSICA

Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with

pepper spray!

CARTER

What the hell.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll

do something.

JESSICA

What'll you do?

CARTER

Whadda you mean what'll I do?!

(facetious)

I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll

beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he

shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna

hit you, I'll beat his ass.

82

JESSICA

What if he doesn't come?

CARTER

Troy said he was bringin' him. If he

doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm

not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna

chase Aaron across the goddam country.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Alright?

JESSICA

Alright, fine.

CARTER

You're welcome.

HEATHER (O.S.)

Hey, there he is! Jimmy!

JIMMY

Thirty bucks.

ALLISON

(counting Bills)

I only got ten.

JIMMY

I don't believe this shit.

83

ALLISON

(finishing counting)

Nine.

JIMMY

You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew

what you asked for!

HEATHER

Jimmy, relax. My God.

JIMMY

No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd

you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam

soup kitchen here.

HEATHER

(mock seductive)

Can't you just take care of us for

tonight?

JIMMY

Yes, for thirty bucks.

ALLISON

Here then, take nine for one.

JIMMY

It's ten.

HEATHER

You know what? You need to get laid,

Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little.

JIMMY

Fine.     Enjoy your night.

HEATHER

Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for

a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.

JESSICA

(trying to muster a sweet

voice)

What are you doing?

KATIE'S VOICE

Watching TV.

84

JESSICA

Did your parents call?

KATIE'S VOICE

Yeah.   I told them you were in the shower.

JESSICA

Okay... good. Thanks.     Are you okay?

KATIE'S VOICE

Oh, hold on!    This is my favorite part!

KATIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Can you hear it?

JESSICA

Yeah, I can hear it.

(hurriedly)

Katie?

COREY

(turning to grab a Cup

for himself)

I don't know about leaving the car out

there in the open like that. You think we

should, like, hide it somewhere?

PEDRO

Cono ya! Don't take this the wrong way,

mehn, but you're like a girl. Bitch,

bitch, bitch.

COREY

Somebody could see it out there!

85

PEDRO

Si, si.   Does your pussy hurt?

COREY

I'm serious, Pedro!

PEDRO

Who's gonna see it out there by the woods?

EMILY

Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper.

COREY

Shut up Emily.

EMILY

No, you shut up! Do you know how

embarrassing you are?!

COREY

Look, it was bad luck as usual.    So what?

EMILY

The car ran out of gas in the driveway!

COREY

The gage was busted!

EMILY

Everybody at school makes fun of me!

PEDRO

And it was way down the block anyway.

EMILY

(to Corey)

And then you try to put everything back!

I mean, God, how stupid can you be?!

COREY

Just shut up, alright?! 'Cause you don't

know shit about anything!

EMILY

The Herald had a picture of the owner

laughing at you!

COREY

Listen, I'm sick of your shit!

86

EMILY

(struggling to break

free)

Get off me! You fucking loser!

COREY

No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.

RJ

You're Jimmy?

JIMMY

You're Sinjin?

RJ

RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a

bookbag. They're back here.

87

JESSICA

Hey.

CARLOS

Where you been?

JESSICA

Talking to Carter.

CARLOS

Is he gonna help?

JESSICA

He said he would.

CARLOS

Look.   Wanna shot?

PEDRO

You want me to talk to her?

COREY

No.

PEDRO

Si. So let's go fix the tire on the

Mustang.

88

CARLOS

(to Jessica)

You wanna play?

HEATHER

(examining her Cards)

What's dickhead doing? I knew he was

lying.

HEATHER (CONT'D)

(to Card Player)

This is your best card?

CARD PLAYER

I ain't happy about it.

HEATHER

Shut up and drink, asshole.

(to Allison)

I should call him.

ALLISON

He said he'll be here.

HEATHER

He's probably got that Tess on all fours,

fucking the shit out of her like the skank

she is.

(thinking about it)

No, you're right, fuck him.

(throwing three fours

down on the table face-

up)

Drink. Fucking everyone drink.

89

LOUIE

Sinjin!

SINJIN

Mr. Pizzaman! What's up?

(referring to Jimmy's

BACKPACK)

Got any calzones in there?

SINJIN (CONT'D)

(re the Pogo Stick)

It's harder than it looks.

SINJIN (CONT'D)

(comfortably, to Jimmy)

Sit down, man, sit down.

RJ

Yo, door don't lock.

90

SINJIN

Well you got to stand your big

muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause

ain't nobody comin' in here.

RJ

I don't give a shit.

SINJIN

Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down.

JIMMY

I like to stand usually.

SINJIN

Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste

is Louie.

LOUIE

I got legs little Massey muthafucka.

JIMMY

(to Sinjin)

I thought it was gonna be just me an' you.

SINJIN

It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's

just here to have a good time.

FEMALE PARTYGOER 1

Excuse me.

91

PEDRO

What the hell are you doing?     We got shit

to do mehn, important shit.

PING PONG PLAYER 1

Corey!   Hey, come beat this asshole!

BARNES

Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go.

PING PONG PLAYER 1

Screw it, you won again. Play Corey.

BARNES

C'mon.   Becker can't beat me.

PING PONG PLAYER 1

(to Barnes' Girlfriend,

handing Corey his paddle)

Watch this.

BARNES

You serve, Becker.

BARNES' GIRLFRIEND

Not too good, baby.

COREY

Go find Mitch.

92

CARLOS

Take it easy. You got to go back and

watch Katie.

JESSICA

Don't remind me. Please.

CARLOS

You signed up for it.

JESSICA

It seemed like a good idea then! Give

some crappy advice every once in a while.

I didn't think it'd be this constant

torture, always wanting to do something,

go somewhere. I'm so sick of it.

CARLOS

Some big sister.

BERUBI

Shut the door!

93

ALLISON

Hey!   Fuck... you! I would never!

HEATHER

Alright, alright! You little slut! I got

one for you!

(pointing to someone off

camera)

Right over there in front of the door!

ALLISON

(thoughtfully)

Well, he's got a nice body. He's a little

scary looking ... he scares me.

HEATHER

You like it, too, you little slut!

ALLISON

Whatever!     You're the slut!

HEATHER

No!  No! Alright, okay, yeah!    Maybe!

(grabbing a bottle of

VODKA and a Cup)

Bring him a drink!

HEATHER (CONT'D)

(motherly tone)

No, Ally, this one is for me. You take

that handsome boy one of these other...

(picking up and putting

down various empty Liquor

Bottles before finally

grabbing a bottle of

TEQUILA with a bit left)

... take him this!

ALLISON

Do we have any yogurt left?

HEATHER

I think so.

94

JIMMY

Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta

talk to you. Call me back right away.

MITCH

(primarily to Heather)

Hey girls, what're you drinking?

HEATHER

Vodka.

MITCH

What're you mixing it with?

HEATHER

Vodka.

MITCH

Really? A little girl like you. You

think I might get you to share a little of

that?

HEATHER

I don't know. There's not much left.

MITCH

If you do something nice for me, I might

do something nice for you.

HEATHER

I'm not that kind of girl.

95

MITCH

No?

(regarding Allison)

How about your friend here?

ALLISON

Oh, now you want to talk to me?

PEDRO (O.S.)

Mitch!   There you are!

MITCH

Hey.

PEDRO

We're outside by the woods. We got the

Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful.

MITCH

Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.

ALLISON

I feel nauseous.

MITCH

(to Heather and Allison,

regarding Pedro)

This is Pedro. We worked together 'til

last week.

PEDRO

(to Mitch)

Vamos, these girls aren't interested in

you.

MITCH

(dumbfounded)

Pedro... what the fuck...

PEDRO

Come on, mehn. Come check out the

Mustang.

ALLISON

Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick.

96

HEATHER

That's nasty.

ALLISON

Fuck you.

HEATHER

Wanna wash your mouth out?

HEATHER (CONT'D)

My God, Ally.

BARNES

One more.

PING PONG PLAYER 2

(reaching for Barnes'

RACKET)

Let someone else play, Barnes.

BARNES

(to Ping Pong Player 2)

You guys suck - he'll be at the table all

night.

PING PONG PLAYER 1

So let him beat someone else.

COREY

You're Mitch?

MITCH

Nice ta meet ya.

97

COREY

(tossing his RACKET to

other side the table in

front of Ping Pong Player

2)

Follow me.

PING PONG PLAYER 2

(wanting to play Corey)

Where you going Becker?

BOBBY

You know I don't get involved with that

shit. You sell your drugs and pay what

you owe.

JIMMY

That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen

to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin.

BOBBY

Sayeed's little brother?

JIMMY

Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three

guys.

BOBBY

One of 'em's a cripple.    Don't make such a

big deal.

JIMMY

A cripple 'cause he got shot!     All I want

you to do is just sit there!

BOBBY

Fuckin' sit there and what?     Pull my

fuckin' cock...

JIMMY

(interrupting)

And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll

handle everything. Everything. You just

sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be

enough. They won't fuck with you, bein'

in prison and shit.

98

BOBBY

Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right

now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my

livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I

fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my

balls.

JIMMY

Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a

partner, that's you. You're gonna help me

now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm

a little fucked.

BOBBY

What the hell's the matter with you? What

the fuck is going on in your head? You

comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you,

and what for.

JIMMY

Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright?

I'll owe you. Just help me out here.

Help me.

MALE PARTYGOER 1

How come I haven't seen you before?    Did

you go to Athens?

EMILY

I still go there. I'm a freshman.

MALE PARTYGOER 1

Really? I graduated last year.    You know

anyone my year?

EMILY

My brother.   Corey.   Becker.

MALE PARTYGOER 1

Oh yeah, I know Becker. He dropped out

our senior year, though. He's your bro?

EMILY

Unfortunately.

MALE PARTYGOER 1

Yeah, he's kind of a loser.

99

EMILY

(defending her brother)

So what are you?

MALE PARTYGOER 1

Ever try this?

EMILY

Yeah...

DRUNK PARTYGOER

(yelling above the noise)

Who is this?!

DEREK

A friend 'a Carter's.

DRUNK PARTYGOER

Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!      Somewhere!

DEREK

Tell him the cops are coming. There's

been several noise complaints.

DRUNK PARTYGOER

What?!

DEREK

The cops are coming!     Tell Carter!

DRUNK PARTYGOER

Oh yeah! Okay, I got it! Cops are

comin'! Tell Carter! Who is this?!

100

DEREK

A friend 'a Carter's!

DRUNK PARTYGOER

Oh yeah, you already said that!

DRUNK PARTYGOER (CONT'D)

(to Partygoers)

Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter.

COREY

It's a good car.

MITCH

It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy.

What do you want for it?

COREY

Make an offer.

MITCH

Twelve hundred.

COREY

Twelve hundred! That's nothing!

MITCH

Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's

gotta do with it. It's not like he can

just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a

go.

PEDRO

Cono, we got thrown outta our apartment!

We need more money!

MITCH

Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can

do.

101

MITCH (CONT'D)

You want another?

CARLOS

Aaron's here.

AARON

(to Carlos)

Hey guy.

CARLOS

Hey.

AARON

You like talking to my girl?

CARLOS

Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.

AARON

No?     Just friends?

CARLOS

Yeah.

AARON

What's the matter, don't like her that

way?

AARON (CONT'D)

(to Carlos)

Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains

out. She'll give you a little surprise.

102

JESSICA

Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin'

asshole with bumps on your cock.

AARON

(to Troy)

Hold this.

AARON (CONT'D)

Better wipe this off good. You never

know.

AARON (CONT'D)

You're good at that. You ready yet to go

bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here?

JESSICA

Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and

he's gonna kick your ass.

AARON

Carter ain't gonna kick shit.

JESSICA

We'll see, right?

AARON

Hold on a minute ...

JESSICA

That's for the pepper spray, asshole!

CARTER

What's goin' on?

TROY

She smashed a whiskey bottle over his

head.

103

JESSICA

He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait

until he hits me again! He can just keep

his fuckin' hands off me!

CARTER

He grabbed her?

TROY

I guess so.   It wasn't a big deal.

AARON

(recovering, to Jessica)

You're dead.

JESSICA

See?

CARTER

Jess, you hit him with a bottle?

JESSICA

Before he fucking hit me!

AARON

(to Carter)

Look, I ain't got no problem with you.

CARTER

Fine. You touch her, and I promised her

I'd beat the livin' piss outta you. I'll

do it. Lay off.

BERUBI

(to Aaron)

You're lucky.

JESSICA

Carter, what the hell?!    You said you were

gonna kick his ass!

CARTER

I said I would step in if he hit you, and

he's not gonna hit you.

104

JESSICA

This is fuckin' bullshit!

TROY

(in awe of Jessica's

ferociousness)

Woe, dude.

CARTER

(to Jessica)

Jessica! What the fuck are you doing?!

JESSICA

If you're not man enough to do what you

said, I will!

CARTER

Jess, I'm not gettin' into this! I'm

sicka' this bullshit with you! You bring

this shit on yourself!

(to Aaron)

Don't touch her.

JESSICA

You know what? I don't need Carter.

What're you gonna do, tough guy?

AARON

(still recovering)

Why don't you give me a minute and see?

JESSICA

Fuck you, you had your minute.

HEATHER

I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I

love Derek. It's just that he makes me so

mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every

time a girl loses her temper, she's a

105

fucking psycho.   Can't I be upset without

being a psycho?   Can't I just be mad?

ALLISON

It's just every time you find a woman near

Derek, you go absolutely nuts.

HEATHER

Let's not use the word nuts, alright?

ALLISON

You know what I mean.

HEATHER

Yeah, well, don't say nuts.

ALLISON

Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not

very nice when another girl is near your

boyfriend.

HEATHER

Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-

ALLISON

(interrupting)

I don't say those things.

HEATHER

Yes you do!   Yes you do!

ALLISON

What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant

that I don't mean them. That I don't mean

to say them.

HEATHER

Well, what do you mean?

ALLISON

I don't know. I mean, you get so angry,

it's a little scary.

ALLISON (CONT'D)

I get scared when you get all angry. You

get so mad sometimes, you start doing

things, saying things to hurt people.

Around you.

106

HEATHER

(starting to cry)

Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say

anything to hurt you, Ally!

ALLISON

(also starting to cry)

I know. Deep down, I know.      But you get

so angry...

HEATHER

I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a

psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare

you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone

or, or anything!

ALLISON

It's alright, I know you don't mean it!

HEATHER

I don't mean it! You're my best friend!

My sister! I love you so much!

ALLISON

No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't

deserve it!

HEATHER

You deserve it! You're so perfect!

ALLISON

Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!

HEATHER

Yes you are!

HEATHER (CONT'D)

You fucking slut!

107

HEATHER

(pointing to Berubi's

bedroom)

Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains

out?

RJ

Sure, I don't give a shit.

HEATHER

Fucking great, let's go.

BOBBY

What the fuck Jimmy?

JIMMY

Just hold on.

BOBBY

I can't figure you Jimmy.

SINJIN

(O.S.)

Where the fuck is RJ?

LOUIE

Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!

108

SINJIN

This your partner?

JIMMY

Where you been?

SINJIN

Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took

long enough.

SINJIN (CONT'D)

(to Louie)

Thought that shit didn't lock.

LOUIE

(to Bobby)

You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales.

BOBBY

Excuse me you cripple motherfucker?

LOUIE

Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you.

BOBBY

Call me that again.

SINJIN

Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do

this.

LOUIE

Call you what again?     What everyone calls

you?

BOBBY

Yeah.   Call me that.

LOUIE

Buggerin' Bobby Bales.

109

SINJIN

Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a

fool...

JESSICA

Where'd we park?

CARLOS

Over here.

CARLOS (CONT'D)

What are you doing? Get in.

JESSICA

Open the trunk.

CARLOS

Jess, let's get out of here.

JESSICA

I want your bat.

CARLOS

Screw that.

JESSICA

I'm gonna finish what I started.   I'm

gonna knock his teeth out.

CARLOS

Let's just go home.

JESSICA

Carlos, open the trunk!

110

CARLOS

Get in the car.

JESSICA

I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

What's the matter? Aren't you gonna put

me in my place?

AARON

(calming down)

Why don't you put that down.

JESSICA

Because I'm gonna use it to bash your head

in.

AARON

You really want to do that?

JESSICA

You really wanna make me?

AARON

You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like

always.

JESSICA

What the hell's that supposed to mean?

AARON

Let me show you something.     Can I show

you?

JESSICA

What?

111

AARON

(inching closer to

Jessica and beginning to

loosen his pants)

I just wanna show you something.

JESSICA

No more 'a this shit, Aaron. Just stand

back there. I'll bash you with this, I

swear.

AARON

Look, just hold on. I wanna show you

this. I got it a little while ago, for

your birthday.

AARON (CONT'D)

Can you see it?

JESSICA

What the hell is it?

AARON

It's J. H. C. I got it for your birthday.

JESSICA

(not knowing what to say)

Bullshit.

AARON

Will you come closer and look?   Troy, tell

her.

TROY

(to Jessica)

It's your initials.    I told him it was

stupid.

AARON

You like it, don't you?   I knew you would.

112

JESSICA

You're an idiot.

AARON

I know.

JESSICA

Does that hurt?

AARON

No.    Try whacking it with the bat.

AARON (CONT'D)

Can we just forget about this?

JESSICA

Yes.

AARON

Happy birthday.

JESSICA

Thank you.

MALE PARTYGOER 1

Hey, what's wrong?

113

COREY

How about two thousand even?

MITCH

Can't do it.

COREY

Why not?

MITCH

It's not economically...

(searching for the word)

Good, right, sound, whatever.

PEDRO

Okay, give us two thousand and I give you

this nice stereo for free.

MITCH

Where the hell you get that?

COREY

Yeah, what the hell is that?!

PEDRO

(to Mitch)

It was in the car.

MITCH

I don't want a stereo.

PEDRO

You can have it for free, mehn.

MITCH

Where's the speakers?

PEDRO

In the back.

PEDRO (CONT'D)

(O.S.)

This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm

telling you. I was gonna keep it myself.

114
