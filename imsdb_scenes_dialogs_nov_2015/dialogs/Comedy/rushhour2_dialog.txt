Rush Hour 2

RUSH HOUR 2

BY

Jeff Nathanson

HU LI

(Chinese, subtitled)

Someone better call the police.

CARTER

(int Chinese)

Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

LEE

(singing)

...wish they all could be California...

wish they all could be California

girls...

CARTER

I warned you about playing that shit

when I'm in the car.

LEE

That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a

Chinese man's CD.

CARTER

Did you see the way those girls drove

off?  I did you a favor.

LEE

Those girls drove off because of you.

CARTER

All I did was invite them for a drink.

LEE

You invited them to get naked and

sacrifice a small goat.

CARTER

(checking Chinese-English

dictionary)

I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

LEE

You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys

Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

CARTER

Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've

been here three days and we haven't done

shit.  We haven't been to a club,

haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on

vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

LEE

Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

CARTER

Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some

women.  Now stop playing dumb and show

me the shu!

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Lee, there was a bombing at the American

Embassy.  Two American translators were

killed.

LEE

Any leads?

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

(beat)

We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't

want to take the case, I'll understand.

LEE

It's my responsibility.

CARTER

What was that?  Did you just pick up a

case?  Did we just take another damn

case on my vacation?

LEE

Of course not.  My Superindendent

invited us to a club tonight.  Big

party.

CARTER

Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will

kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard

you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

LEE

Carter, would I lie to you?

EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

CARTER

That's what I'm talking about.  A real

Hong Kong night club.  You want an

Altoid?

LEE

No.

CARTER

You better take one.  Your breath has

been a little funky all day.  Let me

look at you.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Just relax and don't worry about a

thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You

got condoms?

LEE

No.

CARTER

Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold

it in half.

LEE

I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes.

They don't like tourists in here, so try

to blend in.

CARTER

Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than

everyone here.  Where you going?

LEE

Bathroom.

CARTER

How you boys doing tonight?

CARTER (CONT'D)

That is the worst singing I've ever

heard.  That sounds like something you'd

hear in prison after lights out.

CARTER (V.O.)

Get closer to my body now.  And just

love me, till you don't know how...

LEE

(whispering from side of stage)

Carter, get off that stage!

CARTER

Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a

star, Lee.  A god to these people!

LEE

This is a gangster bar, we're here

undercover.

CARTER

I knew you were lying.

LEE

I'm sorry.

CARTER

Damn it, why are you ruining my night?

I'm just starting to have fun.

(beat)

Well fine then, go ahead, pull your

badge and do your thing.

LEE

No, we're here for information, to find

out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We

must tread softly and keep our ears

open.

CARTER

Tread softly?  Who taught you how to

roost a bar?

LEE

Carter, you don't understand.  These men

are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the

most deadly gang in China.

CARTER

Man, are you crazy?  You think that

scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented

gangs.  We were having gang wars before

anybody even thought about it.  We get

royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme

your badge and gun and I'll show you how

it's done.

LEE

No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am

Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

CARTER

You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner

last night.

CARTER (CONT'D)

(Chinese)

Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang

lui.

CARTER (CONT'D)

(whispering)

What'd I say?

LEE

You just said you're their worst

nightmare - and to line their mothers up

for a milking.

CARTER

Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me

out.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go

to that side, all fine ass women on this

side.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Let's try this again.  Who here knows

Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Now I know you're lying.

CARTER (CONT'D)

(as they run out)

I come back and catch y'all singing

Michael Jackson and you're all going to

jail.

CARTER

Stop!  LAPD!

CARTER

Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Forget this...

CARTER

(out of breath)

Freeze!  Nobody move!

CARTER (CONT'D)

All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

LEE

Try to land on your feet.

CARTER

I can't believe I flew ten-thousand

miles for this shit.

CARTER

You lied to me.

LEE

I'm sorry.

CARTER

You're sorry.  I got somebody's old

chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't

tell me you're sorry.  Just take me

home.

LEE

No time.  There was an explosion at the

American Embassy today -- two American

translators were killed.

CARTER

So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew

up the Embassy?

CARTER

I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of

this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -

let one of them be your partner.

LEE

This won't take long.

MASTER FU

Dragon kick!

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

Lotus block!

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

Twisting Tiger!

MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)

(staring straight at Lee)

Twisting Tiger!

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

Didn't I teach you to always arch your

back?

LEE

(bowing, humbled)

Yes, Master.

CARTER

I was watching you kids.  My name is

Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree

black belt.  At least that's what I tell

the girls at the Holiday Health Spa

where I work out.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Let me give you kids some tips.  The key

to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why

don't you stand up.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show

you how to block.  Come on, stand up,

give me your best shot -- try to kick

right to my head.

CARTER (CONT'D)

That's pretty good.  Which one of you

kids did that?

LEE

I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a

man who used to train with you.  He's

become a killer - the worst kind of

animal.

MASTER FU

Animals kill only from hunger or fear.

The man you seek is lower than a

serpent.

(faces Lee)

...he kills for money.

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

He was the best I ever trained, you

know.

LEE

Ricky Tan?

MASTER FU

No.  Your father.

(Lee reacts)

Your father and Ricky Tan were my

favorite students... and for such awful

things to happen as they did --

LEE

How do I find Ricky Tan?

MASTER FU

A seeding spends its entire life

reaching towards Heaven.

LEE

I know, Master, but...

MASTER FU

The answers you seek can be found in

Heaven on Earth.

LEE

Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't

understand.

(working it)

A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A

mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

MASTER FU

It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven

on Earth."  You will find your answers

there.

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

MASTER FU (CONT'D)

Cheap bastard...

CARTER

And that's how you use the LAPD choke

hold.  Now start practicing and don't

make me come back here!

LEE

Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

LEE

Just follow my lead and act like a

tourist.

CARTER

I am a tourist.

HOSTESS

Good afternoon, gentlemen.

LEE

(in Chinese)

Hello.

CARTER

How you doin'?

LEE

My friend is on vacation, from America.

I want to show him a good time.

HOSTESS

Oh, you American?

CARTER

That's right.

HOSTESS

You bring American money?

CARTER

(holding up a Platinum AmEx)

Never leave home without it.

(to Lee)

Lee, this one's on me.  You save your

money.

HOSTESS

You get massage from Chinese girl

before?

CARTER

No.  It's my first time.

HOSTESS

You pick any girl for you and your

friend.

CARTER

Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that

one.

HOSTESS

Oh yes, she's very nice.

CARTER

She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm

gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take

that one, too.  How you doin', baby?

And...that one in pink.  She can do my

feet.

LEE

What are you doing?

CARTER

She said I could pick any girl I want.

LEE

Well, hurry up.

CARTER

Hey!  You don't break in front of a

black man in a buffet line.

HOSTESS

(to Lee)

Your friend have big appetite.

(handing ROBES to Lee and

Carter)

Please put these on and wait upstairs in

the quiet room.

CARTER

Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come

through, Lee.

CARTER (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

LEE

Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

CARTER

That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall.

I'll go over with you right now, shake

him down.

LEE

This is a very dangerous man.

CARTER

I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna

ruin my massage because of some midget

in a house coat.

LEE

I'm calling for back up!

CARTER

Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over

for you.  Get up.

RICKY TAN

I'm busy at the moment.

CARTER

I said get on your feet!

RICKY TAN

I know you, Detective Carter, right?

You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying

your visit?

CARTER

I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --

and don't let the robe fool you.  This

is the only color they had left.  Now

get up!

CARTER (CONT'D)

I told you to get on your feet!

RICKY TAN

Lee, I've missed you, brother.

(getting up, giving Lee a hug)

I heard about the two Americans, I'm so

sorry, you must be under great pressure.

LEE

You must come with me for questioning.

CARTER

Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken

and hot oil waiting for me.

RICKY TAN

I don't think so...

CARTER

I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

RICKY TAN

It's no problem.  But I must excuse

myself, inspector.

CARTER

That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

RICKY TAN

Congratulations.  And good day.

CARTER

(ref: his privates)

Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

CARTER

Goddamn you got a small ass.

LEE

Don't look at my ass!

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

Chin, you have been ordered by the

Ministry of Public Security to assist

the FBI and Secret Service with our

investigation, to provide us with

whatever we need.  If you have

information, it belongs to us.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

This is still Hong Kong.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

Two Americans have been killed on United

States Government property -- this is

our investigation.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Chief Inspector Lee will brief your

people...

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

No.  He will report to me.  Do we

understand each other?

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)

Who the hell is that?

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

(humiliated)

That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The

detective in charge of our

investigation.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to

talk to the great Inspector Lee.

LEE

Where are you going?

CARTER

Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn

passport back.  I'm going home.

LEE

Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

CARTER

Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,

so I backed you up.  I was about to take

out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

LEE

Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

CARTER

My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes

to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters!

I'm not the one who goes to massage

parlors to bust crime lords!

LEE

It's my job!

CARTER

You're pathetic, man.  When's the last

time you had some fun?  When's the last

time you took a night off, had a date?

LEE

I have plenty of dates.

CARTER

Really?  When's the last time you had

some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when

was it?  Year of the rat?

LEE

You would never understand my life.

You're not Chinese.

CARTER

And you ain't black!

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from

the United States Secret Service.

LEE

The Secret Service?  Why?

STERLING

What I'm about to tell you cannot leave

this room.  The men who were killed

yesterday were not American translators.

They were undercover U.S. customs agents

trying to break a Triad smuggling ring.

We don't know what they're transporting

out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it

got the agents killed.

LEE

How can we help?

STERLING

Stay the hell out of our way.

LEE

I can get to Ricky Tan.

STERLING

We know all about Tan.  That's why we're

leaving him out there as bait.  We think

this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan

and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

CARTER

Captain, you're gonna have to speak up.

I'm on a car phone!

CAPTAIN DIEL

Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong

Kong right now?

CARTER

Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm

in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and

Vine, two minutes from the station.  How

about I pick you up right now and take

you to dinner?

CAPTAIN DIEL

It's nine-thirty in the morning.

CARTER

Did I say dinner?  I meant diner.

Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

CAPTAIN DIEL

Do you know what happened yesterday,

Carter?  I was officially nominated for

the Commissioner's post for the LAPD.

There was a dinner last night, two

hundred LAPD officers were there.

CARTER

Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez

there?  He owes me money.

CAPTAIN DIEL

I've waited my whole life for this job,

but I don't have a shot in hell of

getting it.  Do you know why?

CARTER

Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You

tell them there's no crime in being

lonely.

CAPTAIN DIEL

No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is

because the entire department is about

to find out the stolen credit cards we

impounded were used to buy two first

class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what

the hell is Heaven on Earth?

CARTER

Sir, I'm working on a big case over here

-- and by the time I get back they're

gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you

there?  Hello?  Shit!

CARTER

How you doing?  Can you direct me to the

Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

CARTER (CONT'D)

No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my

birds dead and deep fried.  You ever

been to Popeyes?

CARTER (CONT'D)

No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.

I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --

just put the blade down and let the bird

go.

LEE

Carter!  CARTER!

CARTER

How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven

on Earth.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao

zi.

MAN

You wish to spank my sister with a ping

pong paddle?

CARTER

No man, I was just asking...

MAN

Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

LEE

All he wanted was some mu-shu.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Are you okay, Lee?

LEE

I'm sorry, I have to go.

CARTER

I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

CARTER

(loud)

Follow that limo.

CARTER (CONT'D)

You understand what I'm saying?  Follow

that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This

is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!

(beat)

We are still parked -- we're not moving!

This is the opposite of chasing -- drive

the car or I will kill you!

CAB DRIVER

Now you speak my language.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Lee, we just got a call from the harbor

patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little

party on his boat tonight.  Victoria

harbor.  If you don't want to...

LEE

Did you tell Sterling?

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

Let him find out on his own.  I want the

Hong Kong police handling this.

LEE

Thank you.

CARTER

Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You

understand?

CAB DRIVER

Yes.  I understand.

DOORMAN #1

Invitation, please.

CARTER

I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

DOORMAN #1

The band has been playing over an hour.

CARTER

I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo.

Ricky here yet, I need to get his

requests.

DOORMAN #1

Wait.

CARTER

Last party all he wanted was Sting --

not one person danced.  Tonight I'm

doing Superfreak, I don't care what he

says.  Where is he?

DOORMAN #1

Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the

help.

CARTER

Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the

star.  That's my band up there -- I

control the mood, the groove, the

atmosphere.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Can you do that?

(man shakes head "no")

That's why you're down here and I'm up

there.  Now this is my party -- don't

forget it!

CARTER

How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince

Mubutu from Nigeria.

ISABELLA

Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That

seat is taken.

CARTER

(in mangled Spanish)

San Juan!  You must know my good friend

Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector

Elizondo.

ISABELLA

(in English)

I don't think so.

CARTER

I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled

in the best circles.  But hey, I

understand.  Make yourself at home,

Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever

you want.  My ship is your ship.

ISABELLA

This is your ship?

CARTER

That's right.  I'm the owner, the

Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

ISABELLA

El Capitan?

CARTER

I don't want to play games with you,

Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself

with you -- in one of those bathrooms

over there in about five minutes.

ISABELLA

Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a

beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

CARTER

Called?  What's my ship called?

(he has no idea)

Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow

Johnson.

ISABELLA

The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name

on the back was "Red Dragon."

CARTER

Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

ISABELLA

I'm sure, because this is my friend's

yacht.  And it's his party.

CARTER

Your friend's ship?

(looking around)

Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the

wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason

my keys didn't work.

STEVEN REIGN

(taking seat next to Isabella)

Who's your friend?

ISABELLA

Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

CARTER

Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign?

You're big time.  You own all them big

hotels.  What are you doing in Hong

Kong?

STEVEN REIGN

(ushering away Isabella)

I'm just in town for the weekend, taking

in the sights.

ISABELLA

Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

LEE

Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

BODYGUARD #1

Who's asking?

LEE

The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a

detective today and he's not getting

away with it.  Now where is he?

CARTER

Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or

we'll kick your lying ass!

LEE

Carter?

CARTER

Who died?

LEE

You.

CARTER

Detective Yu?  Never met him.

LEE

Not Yu.  You!

CARTER

Who?

LEE

Do you understand the words that are

coming out of my mouth?

CARTER

Nobody understands the words that are

coming out of your mouth.

BODYGUARD #1

Get your hands in the air.

BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)

Ricky Tan is expecting you.

INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

RICKY TAN

Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw!

You can do it, big guy.

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

Shit!  He still doesn't follow through.

I just lost five grand.

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

Why don't we go on the deck, get some

air...and some privacy.

(to Hu Li)

Leave us alone.

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

(to Lee)

Could you have your partner wait for us

outside?

CARTER

I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I

got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

LEE

(to Carter)

I'll meet you on the main deck in ten

minutes.

CARTER

What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

LEE

I'm okay, you go.

CARTER

Why the hell should you believe him?  He

had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty

shit.

LEE

Remember I told you my father was a

policeman?

(beat)

Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

CARTER

(pause)

What the hell is going on here?

RICKY TAN

Despite what people suspect...what you

suspect --

LEE

Don't.

RICKY TAN

... if your father were alive, I would

be turning to him now.

(beat)

I didn't blow up the American Embassy,

but I believe some of my people did.  My

enemies are trying to frame me.

(beat)

There is a war going on within the

Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My

name has been written into the book of

death.

LEE

The police can protect you.

RICKY TAN

Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal

with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get

me out of Hong Kong.

LEE

Tell me why they killed the customs

agents.

RICKY TAN

There is a ship, in the Hong Kong

Harbor...

CARTER

All right, get your hands up.

CARTER

You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give

you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

LEE

Hu Li!

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was

our only bait, and now he's gone.  You

finally got your revenge - at the

expense of a U.S. Government

investigation.

CARTER

What "revenge" is he talking about?

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid

you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was

a pure vendetta killing -- but you're

off this case.  I don't ever want to see

you again, you got that?

CARTER

Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are

you --

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING

Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going

back to L.A.

CARTER

Fine with me.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN

I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to

fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)

(to police officers)

Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

LEE

I'll take him.

CARTER

Hell no.

CARTER (CONT'D)

(to Lee)

Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to

you.

LEE

Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood

for your bullshit.

CARTER

What are you gonna do about it,

grasshopper?

LEE

I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

CARTER

Give me your best shot, you flat assed

mama's boy.

LEE

Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my

ass!

CARTER

I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

LEE

No.  She's a school teacher.

CARTER

You're not very good at this, are you?

LEE

Good at what?

CARTER

Forget it.

LEE

Five years ago, my father was Chief

Inspector working a big international

smuggling case.

CARTER

Ask me if I give a shit.

LEE

Ricky Tan killed my father.

LEE (CONT'D)

He found out his partner, Tan, had been

working for the Triads all along.

(beat)

Before my father could prove it, he was

killed in the line of duty.

CARTER

How the hell did Tan get away with it?

LEE

All the evidence against him

disappeared, the smuggling case was

unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to

the Triads openly.

CARTER

(pause)

This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,

Lee, you know my father died on the job.

You could have told me...

(realizing)

This is about more than all that, isn't

it?  This is about your Daddy's last

case, right?

LEE

No, no, that would be crazy --

CARTER

You thought the "Customs Agents get

blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky

Tan" and you put it all together and

came up with a five year old case.

That's why you didn't tell me what we

were doing...

LEE

I thought you'd think it was crazy.

CARTER

IT IS CRAZY!

LEE

I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

CARTER

So are you getting on the plane or not?!

LEE

What?

CARTER

Come on, we still got time to order the

Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher

meal, they bring it first.

LEE

I cannot go to LA...

CARTER

It sounds impossible --

LEE

You said --

CARTER

-- but if somebody gave me the chance to

square up my father's death, I'd go to

hell to do it.

CARTER (CONT'D)

You want to figure out why they killed

your Daddy, get on the plane.

LEE

Why LA?

CARTER

(still not turning)

I guess you're going to have to trust me

on this one.

INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

LEE

I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a

boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

CARTER

Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter

Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow

the Rich White Man.

LEE

Follow the Rich White Man?

CARTER

Almost, but you've got to say "Rich

White Man" all run together like it's

one word.

LEE

Follow the RichWhiteMan...

CARTER

Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,

has a rich white man taking his cut.

Every single one.  Now in our case, we

know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

LEE

Who?

CARTER

Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky

Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just

before Ricky got smoked.

LEE

How do you know he's our man?

CARTER

Because when the shooting started he was

way too cool.  See most white people,

when there's shooting, they either hide

in a toilet or start screaming high

pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

LEE

You sound like that all the time.

CARTER

Black people keep their cool when the

shit goes down.

LEE

Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never

panic.

CARTER

Yeah, what about when Godzilla was

coming?  You people were screaming your

asses off.

LEE

Just tell me where I can find this

Steven Reign.

CARTER

The same place you find all

RichWhiteMen.

(a tray arrives)

Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love

this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

CARTER

Yeah, that's definitely the woman from

Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in

his suite at his hotel, I told you this

would work out.  They still just

talking?

LEE

He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

CARTER

He'll be back soon.

LEE

How do you know?

CARTER

Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,

I'll take over.

LEE

Carter, there's something I have to tell

you.  You were right about what you said

in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never

take a day off.  It's all I have right

now.

CARTER

Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

LEE

The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu

in six months.

CARTER

You pull a muscle or something?

LEE

My fiancee left me over the summer -- a

month before our wedding.

CARTER

I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

LEE

It's a long story.

CARTER

Let me guess, she couldn't handle the

cop thing -- never knowing if you were

dead or alive.  I've seen it a million

times.

LEE

No.  It was my singing.

CARTER

Excuse me?

LEE

She hated my voice.  Said it drove her

crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in

bed - in the shower - I thought she

liked it.  She finally told me it was

driving her crazy.

CARTER

Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss

our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

CARTER (CONT'D)

What's she doing?

CARTER (CONT'D)

Lee?  You okay?

LEE

She's just standing around -- not doing

much.

CARTER

Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later

something's gonna happen.

LEE

I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

LEE (CONT'D)

Slow down, baby.

CARTER

What did you say?

LEE

Nothing.  I said nothing.

LEE (CONT'D)

Is it hot in here?

CARTER

Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

LEE

I'm gonna go in the hall and get a

bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

CARTER

What's going on?

LEE

She's getting undressed.

CARTER

Gimme the binoculars.

LEE

No.  It's not right.

CARTER

Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot

you.

LEE

What's she doing?

CARTER

Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

LEE

I don't want to hear this.

CARTER

Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra

and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring

Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -

there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it

looks like Snoopy.

LEE

Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

CARTER

She just took her hair down.  Now she's

going for the bra -- the clasp is in

front -- she's using both hands.

(to Lee)

You better get that ice.

LEE

That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing

this!

CARTER

This is our job.  We took an oath as

police officers.  If we don't do this,

who will?  Firemen?

CARTER (CONT'D)

Wait a sec - what the hell is that

between her legs?

LEE

What?

CARTER

She's reaching into her panties --

something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,

God...please don't let it be a dick.

LEE

What is it?

CARTER

No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a

microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

LEE

I don't understand?

CARTER

She's walking back towards the door.

CARTER (CONT'D)

She opened the door.  Someone is

delivering a package.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Lee...it's the girl who delivered the

package to your office.  It's a bomb!

LEE/CARTER

NO!

CARTER

Damn girl, you fine.

LEE

GET DOWN!!

CARTER

Pick it up!

LEE

It's your turn!

CARTER

I don't need a turn!

LEE

Throw it!

HOTEL GUESTS

Do you want us to hold the elevator?

CARTER

Get the hell away from here!

LEE

Stairs!

CARTER

Get out of the building!

LEE

Roof!

LEE

Wait!  There's people down there!

CARTER

There's people up here!

LEE

Get it out of here!

CARTER

Take it!

ISABELLA

Get on your feet.

CARTER

I wouldn't do that!!!

LEE

It's a bomb.

ISABELLA

You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before

I throw you both in jail for

obstruction.

CARTER

Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you

right now.

ISABELLA

I'm an undercover agent for the United

States Secret Service.

CARTER

How do we know you're not lying?  Let me

see your badge.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Let me see it again?

LEE

We can help you.  I'm a detective in

Hong Kong.

ISABELLA

I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

LEE

Then you know I'm not walking away from

this case.

CARTER

Yeah, that's right.

ISABELLA

We need to get out of sight.  Come down

to my suite.

ISABELLA

(she locks the door)

Look, I've been working this case for

months now...

CARTER

So what's your story?

ISABELLA

They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

LEE

Is this a payoff?

ISABELLA

No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard

of the Superbill?

CARTER

It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

ISABELLA

It's much more than a counterfeit.  14

out of 15 world banks can't tell the

difference.  The paper is Crane linen

blend -- and the bills are printed on

U.S. Intaglio presses.

CARTER

How're they getting into the U.S. Mint

to use the presses?

ISABELLA

In 1959, the United States was very

friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We

wanted his oil, so for the Shah's

birthday, the government gave him a gift

-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The

only one to ever leave the country.

Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that

press on the black market.

LEE

Five years ago?!

(beat)

That's right before he left the force.

ISABELLA

It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until

this past year.  Then Tan got hold of

one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar

plates -- and started making superbills.

LEE

(understanding)

And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

ISABELLA

Yes.  They've printed and shipped one

hundred million dollars, and there's

only one way to spot a fake.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

They use an optical transfer ink from

India that burns red -- the real ink

burns black.

CARTER

What the hell are they going to do with

a hundred million dollars in funny

money?

ISABELLA

The real question is, where are the

plates?  If we can find the plates, we

can stop the whole operation.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

Maybe that's where you can help us.

Carter, this is your city, right?

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the

plates.

(hands Lee a card with a phone

number)

Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this

moment on, you're working for the United

States Secret Service.

STERLING (O.S.)

Sterling.

ISABELLA

Lee and Carter are officially out of the

Secret Service's way...

CARTER

Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my

calling, Lee.

Give me six months and I'll be in

Washington protecting a white guy.

LEE

We both know you would never take a

bullet for someone else.

CARTER

They don't know that.  What are they

gonna do, try and shoot the President

during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella

can pull some strings.  You saw the way

she was staring at me.

LEE

She never even looked at you.

CARTER

You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked

me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're

third world ugly.

LEE

I am not third world ugly.  Women like

me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

CARTER

Snoopy is about six inches taller than

you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a

chance.

EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

CARTER

Kenny!  How you doin'?

CARTER (CONT'D)

How's the action tonight?  The house

making out okay?

CARTER

(to Kenny)

This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud

voice, they all scream and run and shit.

Watch.  It's real funny.

KENNY

Come with me.

KENNY

Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong

Kong, James.

CARTER

What??  Where'd you hear that?

KENNY

I got my sources.

CARTER

And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how

that works out.

(beat)

I'm serious this time, I'm closing this

place down.

KENNY

James, you see my kids back there?  You

know how much I'm paying for private

school?  How can you come in here with

this attitude, you being little Chang's

godfather?

CARTER

Little Chang is gonna have to go visit

his daddy in jail if you don't

cooperate.

KENNY

Jail!?  James, you better back off.

Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

CARTER

I'd like to see you try.

KENNY

(to Lee)

We're on, then.

LEE

(impressed)

That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where

did you learn that?

KENNY

Master Ching taught me.

LEE

The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

KENNY

No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

KENNY (CONT'D)

What are you doing hanging out with Baby

Duck?

LEE

Baby Duck?

KENNY

That's what we all used to call him when

he was a kid -- cause he was always

quacking.  Never shut up.

CARTER

I heard that.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Look, I need some info and I don't have

time to play around.

KENNY

Is this about the funny money?

CARTER

How'd you know?

KENNY

You've been asking loud questions in all

the wrong places all morning.  How come

you always save me for last, James?

When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't

happen I don't know about.

CARTER

So tell me what you know.

KENNY

I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty

good double sawbuck -- but you knew that

too, didn't you?

CARTER

Yeah.  We already been there.  This is

big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service

calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even

tell the difference.

CARTER (CONT'D)

What?

KENNY

One of my regulars lost fifty thousand

dollars at the table here last week.  I

was about to send my boys down to tune

his ass up, when the guy comes in and

pays off the whole thing.  Including the

vig -- brand new sequential hundred

dollar bills.  I knew something was

wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular

job, no way he comes up with fifty grand

in cash.

But I tested the bills, infrared.  The

whole thing.  And they checked out.

100%.

LEE

Do you still have the bills?

KENNY

I still have my lunch money from third

grade.

CARTER

Lemme see 'em.

KENNY

See.  It's perfect.

KENNY (CONT'D)

Whoa, what are you doing?

KENNY (CONT'D)

(pissed off)

I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He

works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

CARTER

All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off

the hook.  For now.

KENNY

You sure you guys don't want to stay and

have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu

shu this side of Compton.

EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

CARTER

(to a worker)

We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is

he here?

HU LI

(in Chinese)

The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will

be remembered for ridding the Triads of

your petulance.

CARTER

I hope you just said I have no business

being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

ISABELLA

Hu Li, I think there's someone who will

want to talk to them first.

CARTER

...oh, that's a filling right there.

That's gonna cost you.

HU LI

Put them in the truck.

CARTER

I should kill you right now, but I'm

gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,

and maybe you can be reformed.

CARTER (CONT'D)

No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck

myself.

LEE

Are you okay?

CARTER

What's the first thing I told you --

never trust nobody.  How could you fall

for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

LEE

She saved our lives.

CARTER

For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's

playing both sides.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a

thing for her.

LEE

Shhh, my head hurts.

CARTER

I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"

me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky

Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang

Long are not in South Central.  I didn't

have to help you.

LEE

Why did you help me?

CARTER

It doesn't matter.

LEE

I'm not used to having a partner.

CARTER

We are not partners.  Between your

daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just

took, as far as I can tell all partners

get you is dead.

LEE

Well we're not friends.

CARTER

You got that right.  And we ain't

brothers.  Maybe we should just end this

right here.

LEE

Fine with me.

CARTER

I won't talk to you, you don't talk to

me.  We'll die in peace.

LEE

See you in the next world.

CARTER

I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I

won't see you in the next world.

LEE

Fine.

CARTER

I believe in heaven.  You people believe

in heaven?

LEE

Yes.  We have heaven.

CARTER

Is it the same heaven, or is it a

Chinese heaven?

LEE

What's a Chinese heaven?

CARTER

I thought it might be like those five

foot and under basketball leagues.  They

don't let everybody in.

LEE

I think we should stop talking.

CARTER

Fine by me.

CARTER (CONT'D)

You thinking about that girl that dumped

you?

LEE

No.

CARTER

If she was the right girl, you'd be

thinking about her.

LEE

Mind your own business.

CARTER

How was the sex?

LEE

There was no sex.  She was very

traditional.  We were waiting until we

were married.

CARTER

You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No

mu-shu?

LEE

No mu-shu.

CARTER

What about a little king pao chicken?

LEE

No kung pao chicken.  Never.

CARTER

Steamed dumplings?

LEE

Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But

only when she was drunk.

CARTER

That's rough, man.  If I don't get

steamed dumplings once a week, I go

crazy.

LEE

Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think

I have a good voice?

CARTER

Are you serious?

LEE

Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

CARTER

As long as you're asking...I think you

have a pretty good voice.

LEE

I knew it.  What does she know.  You

want me to sing something?

CARTER

That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long

usually kill their victims?

LEE

They'll probably torture us first, shock

our privates, then put two bullets in

our eyes and one in the back of the

head.

CARTER

Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

LEE

Did you happen to see the most beautiful

girl in the world...and if you did, was

she crying, crying...hey!

HU LI

Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,

the dragon's been fed.

CARTER

Very nice.

LEE

It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak

spot.  You ignore everything around you,

and put all your energy into one perfect

strike.

CARTER

I'll remember that next time I'm

fighting a box.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Hello, Benjamin.

LEE

Who's Benjamin?

CARTER

Benjamin Franklin, he discovered

electricity.

LEE

A Chinese man discovered electricity.

CARTER

No Chinese man discovered electricity.

LEE

Yes he did.  He also invented the

bicycle.

CARTER

Now that I believe.

CARTER (CONT'D)

You never know.  Besides, I always

wanted to die rich.

LEE

We're slowing down.  This must be it.

CARTER

End of the line.

LEE

You've been a good friend, James Carter.

CARTER

Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting

corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass

from here to Compton.

LEE

You could never kick my ass.  You mama's

boy.

CARTER

Don't you talk about my mama.

(winks at Lee)

That's more like it.

LEE

This way.  I see some lights.

LEE

Vegas...

CARTER

Lee.  I just got an idea how someone

could launder a hundred million dollars

in cash.

EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

LEE

Red Dragon.

CARTER

That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

LEE

Let's go.

CARTER

Wait a second.  We can't go in like

this.  Look at this place, we gotta look

fly.  We gotta Mac out.

LEE

What is Mac out?

CARTER

Follow me my Asian brother.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Just stay down wind, because I think you

stepped in some serious rat shit down

there.

SALESMAN

May I help you gentlemen?

CARTER

Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this

body but pure silk.  And get my partner

something from the children's

department.

SALESMAN

Would your partner like silk as well?  I

personally like it when a couple

matches.

CARTER

Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's

no couple here.  Just two single police

officers working a very dangerous case.

LEE

Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing

us.

SALESMAN

I'm sure all the boys are chasing you

two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys

the bell of the ball.

CARTER

This is the last time I go shopping with

you.

CARTER

(whispering)

Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You

own the place.

LEE

I own the place.

CARTER

That looks exactly like my Uncle

Darrell.

LEE

Buddha is the symbol of luck and good

fortune.

CARTER

Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy.

The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

SIGN

$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

STEVEN REIGN

A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy

village in China hired a young Dragon to

guard their treasure in a cave, hoping

to scare off potential bandits.  Their

plan worked quite well, until the people

of the village started sneaking the

Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him

bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so

much and grew so big -- that he

eventually got stuck inside the cave --

and the treasure was stuck behind him

for all eternity.

(beat)

Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that

lost treasure.  It is here, inside the

greatest casino in the world!  Welcome

to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a

winner!

CARTER

(to waitress)

Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...

(to a cigarette girl)

Get us a box of your finest cigars.

(to a change girl)

Give me ten dollars in nickels.

CRAPS DEALER

Winner!  Seven!

CARTER

Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest

front in the world.

LEE

Carter...here comes the rich white man.

CARTER

Wait here.  I'll handle this.

ISABELLA

Put your arms around me.

LEE

Excuse me?

ISABELLA

Hold me close.  There's cameras

everywhere.

LEE

What's going on?

ISABELLA

I need your help.

LEE

Last time you needed my help I ended up

in the back of a truck.

ISABELLA

I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You

have to trust me.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

You move well.

LEE

Just trying to make it look real.

ISABELLA

Look over there.  That's the eye in the

sky room.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

Behind me is the soft count room.  We're

pretty sure the plates are back there.

LEE

Why don't you go get them?

ISABELLA

If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

CARTER

Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody

get a picture, we can use it for a mug

shot.

STEVEN REIGN

Detective Carter, you always seem to

show up where you don't belong.

CARTER

Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I

want the truth.  Is there any way I can

date your daughter?  Just dinner and a

movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

STEVEN REIGN

Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I

crawled out from under the first rock.

Do you really think you can intimidate

me here?

CARTER

You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most

counterfeiters only get ten cents on the

dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure

genius.

STEVEN REIGN

You play games with me, Detective, and

you'll lose every time.  Don't forget.

The odds are always in favor of the

house.

ISABELLA

The Secret Service almost busted Reign

at his casino in Macao, but the place

burned down before we could move in.

LEE

How do I know I can trust you?

ISABELLA

Dip me!

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

I'm asking for real now -- will you help

the Secret Service?

LEE

No.

(beat)

But I'll help you.

CARTER

Lee, what the hell are you doing?

LEE

Dancing?

CARTER

Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong

arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the

line, and you're up here dancing with

some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

LEE

It was Isabella.  She says the plates

are in the soft count room.

CARTER

Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She

almost got us killed.  She's setting you

up again!

LEE

No.  I'm going to find out.

CARTER

Wait a second.  There's guards all over

the place.  You'll need a distraction.

CARTER (CONT'D)

I'll go to the craps table, make a big

scene.  When security comes over, you

make your move.

LEE

Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

CARTER

I'll give it my best shot.

INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

CRAPS DEALER

Sir, you're aware that we require a

fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble

here this weekend?

CARTER

I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a

hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet

Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,

people, I came to play.

CARTER (CONT'D)

What the hell is that?

CRAPS DEALER

Those are five hundred dollar chips.

CARTER

Did you give me five-hundred dollar

chips because I'm black?

CRAPS DEALER

No, I just assumed...

CARTER

You assumed a brother coming in here can

only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,

is that right?  Are you a racist?

CRAPS DEALER

No, sir.

CARTER

(starting to scream)

Everyone else at the table has thousand

dollar chips, but the black man gets the

nickel, is that it?  Did my people

survive two-hundred years of slavery so

you could send us back to the cotton

fields with five-hundred dollar chips?

Do I look like Chicken George to you?

PIT BOSS

Floor security, we have a problem at

table nine.

CARTER

Answer me one question.  How come Ben

Vereen isn't performing here at the

hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough

for you people?

PIT BOSS

Lionel Ritchie is performing here

tonight.

CARTER

Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since

the Commodores.

PIT BOSS

Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

CARTER

I have a dream, where black people and

white people can gamble together without

getting different chips!

CARTER (CONT'D)

Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

CARTER (CONT'D)

Thank you.  Now in the spirit of

brotherhood, let's play craps!

Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have

change for a twenty?

Open your mouth.

HU LI (CONT'D)

That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector.

Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth

into your brain.

CRAPS DEALER

Winner six!

CARTER

How much is that?

CRAPS DEALER

Two-hundred thousand!

CARTER

Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants

a hundred dollars?

CARTER (CONT'D)

Here, your highness, have a hundred

dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

GAMBLER

(South African accent)

I am not royalty, sir.

CARTER

Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My

great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --

we probably cousins, man.  How much you

got on the table?

GAMBLER

One million.

CARTER

Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who

wants to blow on my hand for luck?

CARTER (CONT'D)

Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady

blows on my hand for luck?

TEXAN

(embarrassed)

She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

CARTER

Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come

on, baby, give me some luck.

CARTER (CONT'D)

Nice blowing.  When's your next

birthday, I'll be the cake.

TEXAN

Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

CARTER

Don't threaten me.  I got friends in

Just sit tight, because I've got the

very greed driven US Customs agent.

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You

know it didn't have to be like this.

But it's too bad!  Like father, like

son.

HU LI

(in Chinese)

He's going for the plates.

RICKY TAN

Look at this old fool, what does he

think he's doing?

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

It's almost impossible to find a partner

that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't

you agree, Lee?

RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

Well, at least you will die with honor.

But choy Gien.

CRAPS DEALER

Winner!  Four, winner!

I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand.

That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those

here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me

out!

It's time to end this, Inspector.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

Don't move!  United States Secret

Service.

HU LI

Get the detonator!

CARTER

Lee!!

CARTER (CONT'D)

Lemme ask you something.  Any of you

ever felt $500,000 before?

CARTER (CONT'D)

Doesn't feel so good, does it?

CARTER

Black man gets on a hot streak and

you're all trippin'?

CARTER (CONT'D)

(help!)

Lee!

LEE

(help!)

MMMMMM!!!!

CARTER

Check it out.  Catfight!

CARTER

What the HELL are you doing with tape on

your face?

CARTER (CONT'D)

This can't be good.

LEE

(diving on Carter)

Bomb!!!

CARTER

Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in

your mouth?

LEE

I did!

CARTER

No you didn't!

LEE

Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

LEE (CONT'D)

Ricky Tan is alive.

CARTER

What?!?!

LEE

We have to get to the Penthouse.

CARTER

Hold on!

CARTER (CONT'D)

You go after Ricky.  I got this.

LEE

Carter...

CARTER

Just GO!

CARTER (CONT'D)

I'm not gonna hold you back this time

just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna

pretend you're a man.

CARTER (CONT'D)

A very beautiful man with a perfect body

who I'd like to take to the movies.

CARTER (CONT'D)

I may have been absent the day we went

over this in karate class.

LEE

Are you okay?

ISABELLA

I'm fine.

LEE

I didn't know which side you were on.

ISABELLA

Now you know.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

RICKY TAN

American's love to gamble.  Don't they,

Mr. Reign?

STEVEN REIGN

I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm

leaving.

RICKY TAN

And my plates?

STEVEN REIGN

They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't

have a problem with that.

RICKY TAN

I enjoyed that little story you told

about the Dragon and the treasure.  My

mother used to tell it to me all the

time.  Do you know the moral of that

story, Mr. Reign?

STEVEN REIGN

Greed will imprison us all.

RICKY TAN

I hate that fortune cookie shit.

LEE

Put the plates down.

CARTER

Will you STOP?!?!

(picks up cocktail umbrella)

What am I supposed to fight you with?

CARTER (CONT'D)

When are you people gonna learn?  Don't

mess with the brothas!

CARTER (CONT'D)

Thank you, Benjamin!

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

RICKY TAN

You're just like your father, Lee.  All

these years hiding behind his badge.  I

wanted to help him, to share with him,

but he was too afraid of change.  When

you think about it, I didn't really kill

him.  I just put him out of his misery.

LEE

Put the plates down.  It's over.

RICKY TAN

I don't think it's over.  There are

casinos all over this country.  Let me

make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make

the same mistake he did.

LEE

If you reach for that gun, I'm going to

kill you.

RICKY TAN

Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

CARTER

Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's

up, Lee?

RICKY TAN

Would you like me to tell you how your

father died?

CARTER

Lee, you okay?

RICKY TAN

He never begged for his life.  Or tried

to make a deal.  All that he asked me,

just seconds before I pulled the

trigger, was that I promise not to kill

you.

CARTER

Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,

man.  He's making you do this.

LEE

It's worth it to me.

RICKY TAN

Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you

gonna spend the rest of your life hiding

like your father?

CARTER

C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You

won, now just put the gun down.

RICKY TAN

That's what I thought.

CARTER

I don't know about you, but I need a

wine cooler.

HU LI

(in Chinese)

We'll go together, Inspector.

CARTER

Please tell me she just asked for a ride

to the airport.

LEE

I can't believe I flew ten-thousand

miles for this shit!!

CARTER

We made it, man.

LEE

No problem.

VERSACE SALESMAN

Well, there is a God after all.

LIMO DRIVER

Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

VERSACE SALESMAN

We're all going gambling and then to see

Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are

feeling lucky!

CARTER

I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she?

You played it cool, though.  Walking

away, never looking back.

LEE

She's going home to New York.  I need

some ice.

CARTER

That your gate down there?

LEE

Yes.

CARTER

I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

LEE

I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

CARTER

You take care of yourself, Lee.

LEE

Carter, wait.  There's something I want

you to have.

CARTER

Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I

can't take this.

LEE

It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

CARTER

In that case, I got something for you.

I picked it up at the hotel.

LEE

What is this?

CARTER

About fifty grand.  I won it at the

tables.

LEE

No, Carter.  I can't take this.

CARTER

It's okay, I got lots more.

CARTER (CONT'D)

They owe us, man.  That's the least they

can do.

LEE

This money is evidence.

CARTER

Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five

minutes and live it up.  There must be

something you want.

LEE

I always wanted to go to Madison Square

Garden.  See the Knicks play.

CARTER

New York City?

LEE

First class.

CARTER

The Plaza Hotel?

LEE

A little Mu-shu.

CARTER

Some Kung-Pao?

CARTER (CONT'D)

I could use a little vacation.

LEE

Amen to that, brother.
