July 2000 Draft

FOR EDUCATIONAL

PURPOSES ONLY

ARAC ATTACK!

SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)

I will be self-assured and

confident around women.

PIG PEN

I will be self-assured and

confident around women.

SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)

I will not fear the unexpected.

PIG PEN

I will not fear the unexpected.

PIG PEN

Ahhhhhhhhhh!

2.

JOSHUA

Hey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE

He's huge!

JOSHUA

They've been like this all week.

Must be something extra tasty in

the water.

MIKE

Like what?

JOSHUA

Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back

in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a

dash of habanero sauce. Mighty

satisfying.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MIKE

You ate snake?

JOSHUA

When you're thirty klicks out from

the nearest firebase. Humpin'

through the wake-up with your

finger on the trigger. Charlie

doesn't give you time to stop for

cutlet.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Charlie, don't surf!

JOSHUA

Quiet, bird.     We're working.

JOSHUA

(dims tank lights)

The sun is going down, my

nocturnal hunters. It's time to

come out and feed.

MIKE

Yeah. They're definitely getting

bigger.

JOSHUA

I've calculated a growth factor of

twelve percent over the last

forty-eight hours. But that seems

to be accelerating.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MIKE

All from eating these bugs?   Maybe

I should try some.

MIKE

Run, little guys.

JOSHUA

They can't outrun the food chain.

MIKE

I could get away.

JOSHUA

Imagine yourself the size of that

fly. A scytodes spitter would be

as big as a Cadillac. You'd be

spider chow, kid.

MIKE

Are the new tarantulas in here?

JOSHUA

Took me forever to get a breeding

set of Chilean reds. I must have

bribed every customs agent from

Vegas to Santiago.

MIKE

That is too cool.

JOSHUA

Male tarantulas compete for the

female's attention.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

5.

JOSHUA (CONT'D)

Each one tries to bring her the

best present. Bugs, rats, even

the occasional parrot.

JOSHUA

The prey is cocooned alive so she

can eat them in her nest. You

know how women love breakfast in

bed.

JOSHUA

Take a look, the female of the

species is three times as big as

the male.

JOSHUA

Say hello to Consuela.

JOSHUA

She fills her prey with digestive

acid to liquify the internal

organs. Now watch... She'll drink

her victim from the inside out.

While it's still alive!

MIKE

(looks queasy)

And you wonder why my mom doesn't

like me hanging out with you.

JOSHUA

Arachnids have been roaming the

earth for millions of years. And

they'll be here long after the

human race is dead and buried.

MIKE

Bad!   Bad Consuela!

6.

MIKE

Do that again and I feed you to

the parrot.

JOSHUA

There's your mom.

MIKE

See you tomorrow, Joshua!

CHRIS

Damn.

(CONTINUED)

7.

CHRIS

Hope you like bologna!

MIKE

You   should see them, Mom. Each

one   has a unique feeding behavior.

The   spitters fire poisonous snot.

The   tarantulas mummify their prey.

The   jumpers can...

SAM

Why does he have all those things?

MIKE

He studies them. NASA uses spider

webs in outer space. And for

medicine. They've been here

forever, and they'll be here long

after we're all dead.

SAM

You're givin' me nightmares.

MIKE

Nightmares are cool.

(CONTINUED)

8.

SAM

U.P.S. brought this to the

station.

MIKE

It's from Dad! He didn't forget

my birthday. I told you he

wouldn't.

SAM

Better late than never.

MIKE

Rockin'!

SAM

Is that the one you wanted?

MIKE

Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of

ram. Integrated modem. Voice

recording capability. This baby

is tight.

SAM

What's wrong?

MIKE

He forgot to send the batteries.

SAM

(annoyed)

I told him to send batteries.

BRET

Hang on, babydoll!

(CONTINUED)

9.

ASHLEY

Oh shit.

SAM

Hang on.

MIKE

Why?

SAM (V.O.)

Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the

bikes.

BRET

There is something very sexy about

an older woman in uniform.

LARRY

Her nine-millimeter gives me a

stiffy.

ASHLEY

Don't antagonize her, you guys.

SAM

I told you not to act like

kamikazes. Especially with Ashley

riding behind. That is

unacceptable, Bret.

(CONTINUED)

10.

BRET

I could always ride her from

behind.

SAM

You just bought yourself a

reckless.

ASHLEY

Can't you give 'em a break?

SAM

Get in the car, Ashley.       Now.

ASHLEY

But, Mom!

BRET

No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up

later.

SAM

(threatening)

Over my dead body.

MIKE

You have the right to remain

silent. Anything you say can and

will be used...

ASHLEY

Shut up, dork.

BRET

Larry, do we know anybody at City

Hall who can mark this go away?

(CONTINUED)

11.

LARRY

Your Dad is the Mayor.

BRET

Oh, yeah.

(to Sam)

He signs your paycheck.

SAM

The next time you put my

daughter's life in danger, I'll

show you exactly how little that

means to me.

BRET

Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.

SAM

I want both wheels on the ground.

MIKE

I read her her rights.

SAM

I can always count on you, Mike.

ASHLEY

Do you get off on humiliating me?

SAM

This bad girl act doesn't suit

you, Ash.

ASHLEY

I'm just trying to have fun.

Don't you remember what it's like

to grow up here?

SAM

That's what scares me.

(CONTINUED)

12.

SAM

I told you to keep this with you.

ASHLEY

You are so over protective.

SAM

A mother's job is to protect her

children.

ASHLEY

You need to start trusting me.

SAM

I'd like to. But you keep

skipping classes to go to the

dunes with Bret.

ASHLEY

Why do you hate him so much?

SAM

I don't hate him. I just want you

to have a future. I thought you

wanted to get out of town. Go to

med school.

ASHLEY

Maybe I want to stay. I could get

pregnant by nineteen. Then

divorce with a couple of kids I

can't handle. Slap on a badge and

be a trailer trash sheriff.

SAM

(deeply hurt)

Thanks for the flashback.

HARLAN (V.O.)

... listening to W.F.R.E. Freedom

radio. We've put aside the

U.F.O.'s and conspiracy

theories...

13.

HARLAN (V.O.)

... for some down home talk back

with our own mayor: Wade Hale.

CHRIS

Oh, great.

WADE (V.O.)

Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,

Chemical Technologies has been

looking for viable storage sites.

And Prosperity is lucky enough to

be on that list.

HARLAN (V.O.)

Lucky? I think most of us are

insulted that some outsiders think

our town is a perfect place to

dump toxic waste.

CHRIS

Right on.

HARLAN (V.O.)

Isn't this just your latest get-

rich quick scheme?

HARLAN (V.O.)

Your mall has more employees than

customers.

(CONTINUED)

14.

WADE (V.O.)

I may have overestimated the need

for 100,000 square feet of outlet

shopping.

HARLAN (V.O.)

And your ostrich ranch?

WADE (V.O.)

If the government subsidies hadn't

dried up, I'd still be rolling in

cash.

WADE

With one phone call I could put

together a deal that would make us

all very rich.

HARLAN

They say money doesn't buy

happiness.

WADE

They probably don't have any.

15.

WADE (V.O.)

Money pays for kids to go to

college. It pays the mortgage.

WADE (V.O.)

It puts food on the table.

Haven't the people of this town

lived hand-to-mouth for long

enough?

WADE (V.O.)

We're all gonna die in this hell

hole.

FLOYD

Yeah, of boredom.

WADE (V.O.)

Wouldn't it be nice not to worry

about surviving retirement? Or

taking a shot at that life-long

dream?

WADE

Think about it, Harlan, you could

buy a commercial transmitter and

start broadcasting to a national

audience.

HARLAN

It would be nice to get the

message out. Let people know the

aliens walk among us.

16.

WADE (V.O.)

If Chris McCormick refuses to sell

his mines. The rest of us are out

of luck.

WADE (V.O.)

I don't think it's fair for one

person to wield that much power.

But he's just like his father.

Selfish. Greedy. And more than a

little bit nuts.

SAM

Uh-oh.

WADE (V.O.)

That family has been digging in

those tunnels since the twenties.

If there was something down there,

don't you think they would have

found it by now?

WADE (V.O.)

Common sense does not apply to

crazy people.

WADE (V.O.)

Might as well be chasing a

leprechaun's pot of gold at the

end of the rainbow.

(CONTINUED)

17.

WADE (V.O.)

... lunatics...

WADE (V.O.)

... certifiably nuts...

WADE (V.O.)

... at the very least...

WADE

... those McCormicks are just

plain-old dumb.

CHRIS

I've warned you not to talk about

my family!

HARLAN

We have a surprise guest in the

studio.

CHRIS

My family built this town!

(CONTINUED)

18.

WADE

Am I supposed to be grateful?

SAM

That's enough!

CHRIS

Stay out of this, Sam!

CHRIS

Did you hear what he said?

SAM

I heard.

WADE

I want him locked up!

SAM

Let's all calm down.

WADE

We have no economy! People are

barely scraping by! And now we've

been offered the deal of a

lifetime. You don't have the

right to stand in our way!

CHRIS

Those mines are full of gas. One

spark in the wrong place could

blow this entire valley sky high.

Do you really want to load that

gun with toxic waste?

WADE

Chem-Tech did seismic analysis,

vapor checks, groundwater reads,

soil sampling. They found

isolated methane pockets, but no

benzene or hydrogen sulfide.

(CONTINUED)

19.

CHRIS

How could they run tests? I

didn't give them permission to go

into the mines.

CHRIS

I asked you a question, you greedy

son of a bitch!

WADE

I'm greedy?! You're the one

keeping us down so you can search

for gold!

SAM

Don't take another step.

CHRIS

You're taking his side?

SAM

I'm trying to keep the peace.

WADE

You're crazy!    Just like your

father!

CHRIS

(sotto)

He wasn't crazy.

SAM

It's okay.

ASHLEY

Maybe you're not gay after all.

SAM

What are you talking about?

(CONTINUED)

20.

ASHLEY

You can't take your eyes off his

butt.

SAM

Where did you learn that it's okay

to talk to me like this?

ASHLEY

Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old

guy. I can admit it. Why can't

you?

GLADYS

Did you pop him one?

CHRIS

He had it comin'. But Sam

Palmer... That woman abuses her

power.

GLADYS

Why? Because she stopped you from

givin' Wade another pop?

CHRIS

I'm not proud of it.

(CONTINUED)

21.

CHRIS

I thought you were trying the

patch.

GLADYS

I am.

CHRIS

That burner's on the fritz again.

GLADYS

Oh something's broken? What else

is new?

(lays bills on table)

You need to pay these by the end

of the month.

CHRIS

(looks at bills)

Today... For a split second... I

actually thought I had it.

GLADYS

Another vein of iron pyrite?

CHRIS

Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch.

I practically blew myself up

trying to get it back.

(CONTINUED)

22.

GLADYS

I'm glad you like my bologna

sandwiches.

(beat)

Maybe you should talk to Wade.

CHRIS

What are you saying?

GLADYS

Honey, if he really does have a

buyer...

CHRIS

You of all people know how much my

dad wanted to find that mother

lode.

GLADYS

Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I

don't think he cared    how that

happened. If he was     still alive,

maybe he'd sell those    mines.

CHRIS

And maybe you didn't know him so

well after all.

GLADYS

You're right... I'm just worried

about how we're going to pay these

bills.

CHRIS

Don't give up on me, Gladys. I

promised him I'd find the gold.

And I will.

HARLAN (V.O.)

Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada.

It's another beautiful day on the

frontier.

23.

HARLAN (V.O.)

No charges have been filed in

yesterday's fracas between Chris

McCormick and Wade Hale. And

we've got...

JOSHUA

An exponential growth rate...

That's impossible.

CHARLIE

Me so horny.   Me love you long

time.

JOSHUA

Be quiet, bird!

CHARLIE

Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

JOSHUA

Stop screwing around...!

JOSHUA

Where'd you go? Consuela?

(CONTINUED)

24.

JOSHUA

Charlie... Semper fidelis.

SAM

Work it, babe.

SAM

It's all yours.

ASHLEY (O.S.)

Ladies first.

(CONTINUED)

25.

MIKE

What's your excuse!?

SAM

You still want a ride, Mike?

MIKE

I'm just going to the mall.

SAM

Have fun.

(CONTINUED)

26.

SAM

Now what?

EMMA

Why do you need to do that as six

in the morning!? Do you hate me

that much!?

HANK

I want to finish before I go to

work.

EMMA

You've been saying that for six

months!

HANK

I can't finish if you keep

interrupting!

27.

HANK

If you're gonna keep pulling the

plug...

EMMA

Have you seen Zeke this morning?

HANK

He was chasing something earlier.

EMMA

If he got into the wall again,

it's your balls in the blender.

HANK

Hey, Zeke.   Breakfast is ready.

EMMA

I'll get the tuna.

HANK

Zeke?

EMMA

What's wrong with him?

HANK & EMMA

Zeke!?   Zeke!    Zeke!

(CONTINUED)

28.

HANK

I've got him by the tail.

NORMAN

(conspiratorial)

Hey, dude. Yeah. You.

NORMAN

Wanna buy some smoke?

MIKE

A pack of cigarettes?

NORMAN

Smoke to get high, not to die. My

stuff is hydroponically grown in a

top secret location. No

artificial flavors. No

preservatives. Just 110 percent

homegrown.

MIKE

Where's this secret location?

(CONTINUED)

29.

NORMAN

I could have a dime bag for you

toot sweet. But if I tell you

where exactly, I'd have to kill

you.

MIKE

Norman, you know my mom's the

sheriff.

NORMAN

Oh yeah... Right on...

(considers this)

Does she get high?

CLERK

The bug spray is on aisle five!

MIKE

What?

CLERK

You want mousetraps!?       Is that

it?! Aisle five!

CLERK

Oh.     I thought you wanted...

OLD LADY

Excuse me, young man. Where can I

find the bug spray?

CLERK

Aisle five!

(CONTINUED)

30.

CLERK

(over PA speakers)

All bug spray, rodent traps, ant

poison and fly paper is on aisle

five!

CLERK

That'll be three fifty-two.

MIKE

Where's aisle five?

31.

MIKE

Hello?   Joshua? Charlie?

MIKE

(into PDA)

Captain's log. Stardate...

MIKE

Cool!

(records again)

The house is deserted. No sign of

Joshua Taft or his bird. The

spider tanks are shattered. There

is broken glass everywhere.

(CONTINUED)

32.

MIKE

(into PDA)

Animal tracks. Definitely too big

to be spiders. Could be rats.

CHRIS

What am I, the Pied Piper...

33.

FLOYD

I'm sorry.   I haven't seen him.

SAM

Quiet!   Quiet please!

BEVERLY

They were clogging up my house!

EMMA

I want to know what killed Zeke!

TRAVIS

He was a good dog! He wouldn't

just get up and go!

SAM

I had spiders at my house too.     We

need an exterminator not a

sheriff.

TRAVIS

What about my dog?

(CONTINUED)

34.

SAM

I don't know, Travis. We're gonna

keep an eye out. But we're not

gettin' anywhere like this. You

should go back out there and look

for your animals. If they haven't

shown up by tonight. I'll call

Fish and Game. Okay?

MIKE

Mom! Mom!   All Josh's spiders are

gone!

SAM

I can't do this right now, Mike!

Everyone's having pest problems!

MIKE

But Joshua is gone!

SAM

Maybe he's out looking for his

spiders?

MIKE

Mom, I'm serious! You're not

listening!

SAM

Mike... I've got missing pets.

Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and

mice coming out of basements. And

your sister's about to end up on a

milk carton. I can't have you

losing...

SAM

Hello? Wade... wait a second...

your ostriches?

35.

WADE

Came out to feed my birds this

morning.

SAM

Coyotes?

WADE

Hell no!

WADE

My flock had fifty birds! Where'd

they go, dammit! Who the hell

steals fifty birds that can't even

fly!?

SAM

All this happened last night?

WADE

I guess.   And we didn't hear a

thing.

SAM

What about him?

WADE

Not a peep.

SAM

How's the ostrich business?

WADE

Not so good lately.

SAM

You've got that new Hummer. You

must be makin' enough to pay for

it.

(CONTINUED)

36.

WADE

(annoyed)

You like it? I'll take you for a

ride.

SAM

These birds are insured.   Right?

WADE

I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is

that what you think?

WADE

(in the distance)

... reject... absolutely not...

MIKE

(into PDA)

I've found more tracks.    Even

larger now.

37.

WADE

(to Clyde)

Now you're on the job?! What the

hell were you doin' last night?!

SAM

Come on, Mike.     Let's hit it.

WADE

I need to know what happened to my

birds!

(CONTINUED)

38.

SAM

If I find anything I'll let you

know.

(a beat)

So you can fill out that insurance

form.

MIKE

We have to go back.

SAM

Mike?

MIKE

That was a trapdoor spider's

burrow.

SAM

What are you talking about?

MIKE

Joshua was feeding his spiders

bugs from the creek. And they

were getting bigger.

MIKE

(agitated)

What if they didn't stop growing?

What if they broke out of their

tanks. Ate Joshua. And went into

the mines?

MIKE

That could be why the other

species are coming out into the

open. They're trying to get away

from the giant spiders.

(a beat)

The ecosystem is out of balance.

(CONTINUED)

39.

SAM

Have you been overdosing your

Ritalin?

MIKE

Maybe I am losing it...

ASHLEY

Woo-hoo!

ASHLEY

Haven't you had enough of that?

(CONTINUED)

40.

BRET

No such thing.     Norman's bud is

da'kine.

BRET

When I medal at the X-Games, Honda

will give me full sponsorship.

Then I'll take you with me on the

Supercross tour.

BRET

Are you still thinking about going

away?

ASHLEY

I don't know. I want to do

something with my life, Bret.

Help people. Maybe med school is

still an option.

BRET

Not if you keep hanging out with

me.

ASHLEY

Thanks, Mom.

ASHLEY

Slow down...

BRET

I thought you loved me.

ASHLEY

I do!

BRET

Then what's the problem? You want

to leave town. You don't want to

make out.

ASHLEY

I don't feel...

(CONTINUED)

41.

BRET

What?

ASHLEY

I don't want to lose my virginity

in the front seat of a monster

truck.

BRET

Why didn't you say so? We can go

outside. I've got a blanket in

the back.

ASHLEY

No... I guess... I'm just not

ready.

BRET

Tammy and Larry do it every night!

ASHLEY

Then call them! Have a menage a

trois!

BRET

Come on,   Ashley. Mommy's not

around.    You don't have to play

the good   girl. Let Daddy give you

what you   really want.

ASHLEY

Please, Bret... Please don't...

BRET

My balls? Ahh! My balls!

(looks down)

I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch!

(CONTINUED)

42.

ASHLEY

I told you to back off!

BRET

Ashley, wait!

ASHLEY

Screw you, Bret. I'm going home.

BRET

Please!   Open the door!     I'm

sorry!

ASHLEY

I can't believe my mom was right

about you. Do you know how

embarrassing that is?

BRET

Open the door, baby!      I love you!

I want to marry you!      Have my

children! Please!

43.

LARRY

Dude, did you piss in your pants?

RANDY

Ha-ha!   Bret pissed his pants!

BRET

Get out of here! They're coming!

RANDY

The only one coming is you, dude.

BRET

Ride!

(CONTINUED)

44.

SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)

I will live every moment of my

life as if it were my last.

PIG PEN

I will live every moment of my

life as if it were my last.

MIKE

Hello?   Hello?

45.

WAITRESS

The phones went down for some

reason. Maybe that's why Bret

didn't call. Did you want to go

ahead and order?

WADE

Just give me the usual.

WAITRESS

One ostrich steak, comin' up.

(CONTINUED)

46.

GLADYS

What are you doing home?

CHRIS

Need some rat traps.

GLADYS

Try the basement.

CHRIS

What is all this?

GLADYS

I wanted to surprise you with a

special dinner. Turkey De La

Gladys.

CHRIS

I'll have mine without Nicotine.

GLADYS

Not as good that way.

CHRIS

Rats...

47.

CHRIS

Have you been smoking?

GLADYS

No.

CHRIS

Gladys...

GLADYS

Get back to work. I'll see you

tonight.

GLADYS

Sam called for you.

GLADYS

She wants you to come by the

station.

CHRIS

She really has it in for me.

GLADYS

Oh please.

CHRIS

What?

GLADYS

You two should just sleep together

and get it over with.

CHRIS

Me and Sam... Hook up...

GLADYS

I may be older than electricity,

but I used to be a nice-looking

piece of tail.

CHRIS

Too much information.

(CONTINUED)

48.

GLADYS

I'm not kidding. I got more

action than those chicks on VIP.

So when I tell you Sam thinks your

butt is U.S.D.A. choice...

CHRIS

This is where I throw up.

GLADYS

Don't tell me you don't think

she's a fox.

GLADYS

See you for dinner.

SAM

Nothing yet. I'm sorry.     We're

still trying to get...

SAM

Let me call you back.

(hangs up)

This has been one crazy day.

We've got missing pets, dead

ostriches. God only knows what's

next.

CHRIS

I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade

is... He knows how to push my

buttons.

SAM

I wanted to ask you...

CHRIS

On a date?

(CONTINUED)

49.

CHRIS

I'm kidding.   What did you want to

ask?

SAM

Have you noticed anything strange

in the mines?

CHRIS

Define strange.

SAM

I had spiders in my house. Hector

had roaches in his basement. Some

mice...

CHRIS

How about stampeding rats?

SAM

Were they running away from

something?

CHRIS

Could have been. Never saw them

do that before. I guess it

qualifies as strange.

CHRIS

Sam... Do you want to go out

sometime?

SAM

(taken aback)

Are you asking me out on a date?

CHRIS

Only if you're going to say yes.

(CONTINUED)

50.

CHRIS

So that's a 'No.'

SAM

My kids are the world to me,

Chris. When their dad left... it

really took a toll. On all of us.

I can't go through that again. I

won't.

CHRIS

No... I understand... I don't know

what I was thinking...

(laughs)

Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm

gonna kill her.

(CONTINUED)

51.

PETE

The museum's on fire!

CHRIS

No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me

go!

SAM

Maybe she got out.

CHRIS

(devastated)

She was cooking. The stove was

broken.

SAM

Why don't you come home with me?

We'll get you cleaned up.

(CONTINUED)

52.

TRAVIS

Get away from there, Mike!

MIKE

Holy God...

MIKE

Mom!   Wait!

TV DOCTOR (V.O.)

One... two... three...

TV DOCTOR (V.O.)

Helping people never gets old.

SAM

Is Bret here?

ASHLEY

No.

SAM

Then why is his truck out front?

(CONTINUED)

53.

ASHLEY

Don't worry about it.

SAM

What do you mean?     What happened?

ASHLEY

Nothing.

ASHLEY

Nothing happened, alright!

MIKE

Spiders shed their skins when they

grow.

MIKE

Like snakes.

CHRIS

Gladys is dead.

MIKE

Maybe not.

MIKE

This is a tarantula's leg. Or it

was. It's an exoskeleton, to be

scientific.

CHRIS

It's a little large.

(CONTINUED)

54.

MIKE

See! Male tarantulas wrap their

prey in webbing. Tight like a

mummy. The food stays alive so

they can eat it later.

SAM

Mike, please.    Now isn't the time.

CHRIS

They keep their food alive.

SAM

What is this?

MIKE

A spider's leg!

MIKE

Careful!

SAM

No. That's a piece of cactus.

Look... It's covered with spines.

MIKE

Those are quills! Tarantulas can

flick them at you like darts!

SAM

Giant tarantulas?

MIKE

Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!

Joshua had a ton of exotics!

(CONTINUED)

55.

CHRIS

If there were giant spiders

roaming the desert, don't you

think somebody would've seen them

by now?

MIKE

The jumpers hunt in daylight. But

not the others. They only come

out when the sun goes down!

SAM

I guess I should watch more

'Oprah.' It must be a textbook

'no-dad' kind of thing.

CHRIS

That one looks kind of scratchy.

SAM

All Jason cared about was getting

out and starting over. I guess

that included buying a new

wardrobe.

(CONTINUED)

56.

CHRIS

Gladys thought I should sell...

but you know... I never wanted to

get rich. If it was about the

money, I would have sold out to

Wade a long time ago.

CHRIS

I think I just wanted to prove the

gold was down there. That my

family wasn't crazy to keep

looking. Even after we'd lost so

much. And now... she's gone, too.

SAM

I'm sorry, Chris.

CHRIS

Do you know what I'm trying to

say?

SAM

It wasn't about spending the gold,

it was about finding it.

CHRIS

That's right.    That's exactly

right.

CHRIS

Remind me never to let you do my

laundry.

SAM

They look great.

(CONTINUED)

57.

MIKE

Can't you turn that down?!

MIKE (O.S.)

I'm doing spider research!

ASHLEY

(sotto)

Spider... Mike... Spider...

58.

MIKE

Wow!   A scytodes spitter!

ASHLEY

Where are you going?

MIKE

The scytodes spits a gooey

discharge to immobilize their

prey.

ASHLEY

No shit!

ASHLEY

Use my stun g...

(CONTINUED)

59.

MIKE

(reads)

Watch its fangs! The spitter's

fangs move from side to side as it

fires!

CHRIS

I'll keep that in mind.

MIKE

Get under it! Stab it in the

abdomen! They don't have any

armor down there!

CHRIS

How am I supposed to do that!?

CHRIS

I'm gonna need some new pants.

(CONTINUED)

60.

SAM

Ever used one of these?

CHRIS

I'm a fast learner.

MIKE

I told you! I told you all!     But

nobody ever listens to Mike!

Still think I'm crazy, Mom?

SAM

I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

SAM

Calm down, baby.

ASHLEY

There aren't enough wine coolers

in the world to calm me down!

SAM

I won't let anything happen to

you.

CHRIS

What other spiders did Joshua

have?

MIKE

Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers,

tarantulas...

CHRIS

Why couldn't he keep goldfish like

a normal person?

SAM

We need to warn people.

CHRIS

How about the radio station?

(CONTINUED)

61.

SAM

Good one.    We'll go to Harlan's.

ASHLEY

Outside?    You want to go outside?

SAM

It's okay...

HARLAN

... I'm saying the invasion has

already occurred. The aliens are

among us. But they've taken

common forms. They hide in plain

sight.

SAM

We need to make an emergency

broadcast.

(CONTINUED)

62.

HARLAN

What happened?

MIKE

Giant spider invasion.

CHRIS

What are you going to say?   You

can't tell them the truth.

SAM

(into microphone)

Is this thing on? Hello? This is

Sam Palmer. We have an emergency

situation.

SAM (V.O.)

A pack of rabid coyotes is loose

in town.

SAM (V.O.)

They are extremely dangerous.

SAM (V.O.)

Arm yourselves with any weapons

you can find.

63.

SAM (V.O.)

Stay together and head for the

mall.

CHRIS

The mall?

SAM

The walls are concrete and the

exits have steel gates. We could

hold an entire army of giant

spiders from inside.

ASHLEY

You just said giant spider on the

air.

HARLAN

Now that's great radio!

SAM

Not giant spiders!      I meant to

say...

HARLAN

The aliens!

64.

MIKE

Wait, Mom! The noise will attract

more of them!

CHRIS

Let's try for the mall.

CHRIS

My truck's at the museum.

SAM

Your keys?

CHRIS

In my other pants.

MIKE

Look out!

HARLAN

Stop!    Take us with you!

65.

WADE

No!     Please!

WADE

Thank you!

MIKE

You stink.

WADE

(to Ashley)

Have you seen Bret?

ASHLEY

He was out at the dunes.

SAM

Go ahead.    I've got your butt.

CHRIS

What?

SAM

Your back!    I've got your back!

(CONTINUED)

66.

MIKE

Trapdoors!    They're all around us!

SAM

How can we spot them?

MIKE

I didn't download that part!

ASHLEY

You dork!

TRAVIS

Help... me... please...

CHRIS

Keep going!

67.

ASHLEY

There's someone inside!

NORMAN

We're closed.

NORMAN

Wait! I have a prescription!

It's for my glaucoma!

SAM

Open this goddamn door!

NORMAN

Yes, ma'am.

MIKE

Get away from the doors!

NORMAN

Be cool, little dude.     They're

locked.

MIKE

Glass won't stop them!

SAM

The gates!    Close the gates!

(CONTINUED)

68.

ASHLEY

Mom!

MIKE

Hurry up!

SAM

Shut the other entrances!

NORMAN

Trick or treat.

CHRIS

We're sealed up at both ends.

SAM

You pump the slide to jack in a

fresh round. Point at your target

and squeeze.

(CONTINUED)

69.

WADE

Watch it!

CHRIS

Like that?

SAM

Try not to cut yourself.

WADE

Why didn't we see them earlier?

MIKE

For the last time! They can't

handle the sunlight. They were

waiting in the mines for the sun

to go down!

CHRIS

Then at daybreak they'll go back

inside. We can walk out the front

door.

MIKE

We won't make it that long.

ASHLEY

They're gonna come in after us?

MIKE

They're growing very fast. They

need food to sustain that kind of

development.

HANK

Someone should go out and get

help.

(CONTINUED)

70.

EMMA

You go, Sam.

SAM

Me?

WADE

You're the sheriff.

SAM

I don't have that many handcuffs.

PETE

What about the police radio?

SAM

You're not goin' back out there,

Pete. None of us are.

CHRIS

Radio Shack is full of cell

phones.

WADE

But the signal won't get out of

the valley. That's why we

couldn't sell any of the damn

things.

HARLAN

My antenna...

HARLAN

I could climb up to the top. I

bet I could get a signal out.

WADE

Great idea.    You should do that.

CHRIS

I'll cover you, Harlan.

(CONTINUED)

71.

SAM

Are you sure you can handle this?

CHRIS

(re: pants)

While I'm gone, do you think you

could find me a size 32?

SAM

I'll do my best.

(a beat)

Uhh... Do you want to go out

sometime?  Dinner? Maybe a movie?

WADE

Hey, loverboy... you've got a town

to save.

ASHLEY

You're not really going to get him

bigger pants are you?

SAM

No way.

CHRIS

Don't even think about locking

this door.

WADE

I'll be right here waiting.

(CONTINUED)

72.

CHRIS

It looks clear.

ASHLEY

I didn't know you wore cologne.

MIKE

I don't.   It's spider repellent.

SAM

Let's stay together, guys.

ASHLEY

(holds up a teddy)

Can I get this?

SAM

Move it!

(CONTINUED)

73.

CHRIS

We've got company!

CHRIS

This always looks so easy on TV!

HARLAN

I've got a signal!

CHRIS

They're coming!

OPERATOR (V.O.)

911 Emergency.

HARLAN

I'm calling from Prosperity

Nevada! We're being attacked by

giant spiders! The entire town

has been overrun!

CHRIS

No!   Don't say that!

OPERATOR (V.O.)

This is Emergency Services. Not

dial-a-joke.

(CONTINUED)

74.

CHRIS

What happened?

HARLAN

They didn't believe me!

CHRIS

What a shock!     Try again!

OPERATOR (V.O.)

911 Emergency.

HARLAN

There was a massive explosion!

Everybody's dead!

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Sir, your number has been flagged

as a source of a crank call. I'm

afraid I must terminate this

conversation.

HARLAN

She hung up on me!

CHRIS

Climb!

SAM

(sotto)

Oh my God...

ASHLEY

They're inside!

(CONTINUED)

75.

WADE

Over here!

CHRIS

I've got you!

HARLAN

Defend the human race!

CHRIS

No!

(CONTINUED)

76.

SAM

Ashley!   Mike!

FLOYD

Having a bad hair day?!

FLOYD

How about a little off the top!

CHRIS

You're going down!

MIKE

Arac attack!

(CONTINUED)

77.

SAM

Did you get help?!    Is anybody

coming!?

CHRIS

We're on our own!

ASHLEY

I can't stay in here!

ASHLEY

What are they doing?

MIKE

(checks Cassiopeia)

They're trapping us like ants in a

log! Once they have all the exits

blocked, they'll come in through

the last one!

MIKE

We've gotta go!

ASHLEY

Here!

78.

HANK

It's tool time!

SAM (O.S.)

Chris!

MIKE

Where do you grow your weed?!

NORMAN

Dude, if I tell you, I have to

kill you.

MIKE

They're going to kill us, you

stoner!

NORMAN

Over here!

(CONTINUED)

79.

WADE

Where are you taking us?

NORMAN

To Shangri-la.

NORMAN

You aren't going to arrest me for

this are you?

SAM

Not today.

WADE

(to Norman)

Oh great! Now you've trapped us!

CHRIS

We should be able to hold them off

for a little while.

ASHLEY

They're coming through the wall!

CHRIS

What the hell?

(CONTINUED)

80.

BRET

I didn't touch her!     I swear!

ASHLEY

Don't waste your bullets.

WADE

I thought you were a goner, boy!

CHRIS

We can get out this way!

ASHLEY

Aren't the spiders in there?

MIKE

Not until daylight.

BRET

You're going back in there?!       Are

you all crazy!?

WADE

Come on, Bret!

BRET

No way!   I'm not going!

81.

CHRIS

Cover me!

SAM

What are you going to do?!

SAM

Hurry!

SAM

Hold that thought.

WADE

We're trapped again!

CHRIS

At least they can't follow us.

SAM

Which way do we go?

CHRIS

I think we're in one of the old

tunnels.

SAM

Can you get us out of here?

CHRIS

Don't worry, Sam.

82.

CHRIS

I don't believe it...

MIKE

I've seen one of these before!

ASHLEY

What are they?

CHRIS

Toxic waste.

SAM

Where did you see it, Mike?

MIKE

The creek where Joshua gets his

spider food. There was one in the

water.

CHRIS

We can get out this way!

BRET

No, we can't.

(turns to Wade)

Isn't that tunnel blocked off,

Dad?

WADE

Uh... yeah... he's right.   We

can't get out that way.

CHRIS

You did this?

WADE

I knew you'd never sell... We're

under my property so...

(CONTINUED)

83.

SAM

You put all of us at risk.

WADE

I didn't have a choice! I was

broke! They gave me a hundred

grand!

SAM

I think our lives are worth a

little more than that.

CHRIS

We're wasting time.

CHRIS

One end of these lights should be

connected to a generator. That'll

be near the entrance.

WADE

My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't

lying! That's what I can put on

the insurance form... giant

spiders!

ASHLEY

Ewww... what's that smell?

(CONTINUED)

84.

CHRIS

Methane.   This cavern is full of

gas.

ASHLEY

What does that mean?

CHRIS

One spark and we're all dead.

MIKE

That's what I was talking about,

Chris. Presents from the male

tarantula to the female.

BRET

So the female's around here?

SAM

That one just moved!

CHRIS

There's somebody in here!

CHRIS

Gladys!

CHRIS

Gladys, please...

(to the others)

Can anybody help her?!

(CONTINUED)

85.

ASHLEY

Her breathing is shallow.       She's

going into arrest.

CHRIS

It's okay.    It's okay.

GLADYS

Am I... dead?

CHRIS

You're okay.

GLADYS

I'm not in heaven?

CHRIS

No...

GLADYS

Then what's with all the gold?

WADE

Gold! Gold!     Look!    It's

everywhere!

SAM

Is it real?

CHRIS

Jesus... it's the mother lode...

He was right. My dad was right...

GLADYS

So were you.

(CONTINUED)

86.

WADE

Get as much as you can!

BRET

Nice work, Doc.

SAM

You saved my life.

GLADYS

Have you got a smoke, kid?

NORMAN

The man says this cavern is full

of highly flammable methane gas.

I smoke to get high, not to die.

SAM

Spiders!

NORMAN

What's the big deal?

MIKE

I think you should stop.

NORMAN

Why?

MIKE

They don't have hair. They aren't

fully grown tarantulas.

(CONTINUED)

87.

MIKE

They're giant babies!

MIKE

Consuela.

CHRIS

Consuela?

NORMAN

Bummer...

CHRIS

Go!

CHRIS

Leave it!

WADE

So you can keep it all!?   Hell no!

(CONTINUED)

88.

BRET

Dad!

CHRIS

Bret, come on!

ASHLEY

Bret!

BRET

I'm sorry I...

SAM

We have to get out!

CHRIS

This is our chance to kill them

all.

CHRIS

When the power comes on, the bulb

will ignite the methane and torch

them!

SAM

Where did you get an idea like

that!?

GLADYS

I blew up the kitchen.

(CONTINUED)

89.

CHRIS

Keep going up the tunnel. There

should be a generator at the exit.

Start it up and await for my

signal to throw the switch.

SAM

And the toxic waste...

CHRIS

Will be buried under tons of rock!

Go!

SAM

What about you?

CHRIS

I need to set the fuse as close to

the spiders as I can. That should

give us time to get clear.

SAM

He has a cute butt.    Don't you

think?

GLADYS

U.S.D.A. choice.

CHRIS

Bingo.

(CONTINUED)

90.

MIKE

Mom!

SAM

Keep going!

CHRIS

I hate spiders.

ASHLEY

Hurry!

ASHLEY

Oh shit.

(CONTINUED)

91.

SAM

Banzai!

MIKE

It needs gas!

GLADYS

There's a ranch!

MIKE

It needs gas!

ASHLEY

Hurry!

CHRIS

Start the generator!

92.

MIKE

He's coming!

ASHLEY

Hurry, Mom!

CHRIS

Throw the switch!

SAM

I don't have any power!

ASHLEY

Yo, Mom!

93.

SAM

Come on!

SAM

Chris!

ASHLEY

Earthquake!

CHRIS

No! It's a chain reaction! The

whole valley is going to blow!

MIKE

We'll never get out in time!

(CONTINUED)

94.

GLADYS

Let's get the fuck out of here!

MIKE

Oh no... she's molting!

MIKE

Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad

Consuela!

95.

CHRIS

I really need some pants that fit.

MIKE

Look out!

(CONTINUED)

96.

FADE OUT.

THE END?
