1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

KATE

I got you a few necessities...

KATE  (CONTD)

Your copy was a mess...

KATE (CONTD)

Every one of these songs will

remind you of me in a slightly

different way...

JACK

All in one tape?

KATE

I also put side two of London

Calling on there...

KATE  (CONTD)

That was not officially the

goodbye kiss. It was just an

interim kiss...

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

This will be the final boarding

call for Pan Am flight 4 to

London, Heathrow.

KATE

You have your ticket?

JACK

Im not even gonna say it,

Kate. Maybe itll be like

I never left...

KATE

Wait.

KATE (CONTD)

I have a bad feeling about

this.

JACK

About the plane? What do you

think its gonna crash? Dont

say that...

KATE

(shaking her head)

I know weve talked about this a

thousand times and we both agree

that going to London is the

right thing to do. But in my

heart... this feels wrong.

KATE (CONTD)

Dont  go, Jack...

JACK

You mean dont go at all?

What about my internship?

KATE

Believe me I know what an

incredible opportunity this

is for you...

JACK

For us, Kate.

KATE

Right, for us. But...Im

afraid that if you get on

that plane...

JACK

What?

KATE

(torn)

Go. Im sorry, you should just

go...

JACK

(thinking, then...)

No, youre right.  What are we

doing?

KATE

We're being responsible.  Go.

Get on the plane.

KATE (CONT'D)

(a smile)

Get the hell outta my sight.

You bother me.

JACK

(resolute)

Okay, I'm going...

KATE

I can't seem to let go of

you...

JACK

You hear me complaining about

that?

JACK (CONT'D)

Look, we're at the airport and

no one ever thinks clearly at

the airport so we should just

trust the decision we already

made.  You've been accepted to

one of the best law schools in

the country, I've got this

internship at Barclay's Bank.

We have a great plan, honey...

KATE

You want to do something

great, Jack?  Let's flush the

plan...start our lives right

now, today...I don't know what

that life's gonna look like

but I do know it has both of

us in it.  And I choose us...

KATE (CONT'D)

The plan doesn't make us

great, Jack.  What we have

together, that's what makes us

great.

JACK

I love you, Kate...

JACK (CONT'D)

(taking her face in

his hands)

...and a year in London's not

gonna change that.  A hundred

years couldn't change that...

I hope you don't mind.  There

JACK

It's not what you think.  I

took Mentadent public...

PAULA

Did you really mean what you

said about Tuscany?

JACK

Of course I did.

PAULA

Last night was great...

JACK

You are an amazing lover.  You

should be giving motivational

seminars.

PAULA

Thanks.  You're not bad

yourself...

JACK

I want to see you again.

PAULA

I'd like that, too.

JACK

Tonight.

PAULA

It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

JACK

So we'll get egg nog.

house out in Jersey.  Would

you like to come?

JACK

Jersey?  You know what the

traffic's gonna be like?

PAULA

I'm taking the train...

PAULA (CONT'D)

Don't you have anywhere to go?

JACK

I've got plenty of places to

go.

PAULA

(a sexy laugh, then...)

Maybe I can try and sneak away

some time tomorrow morning...

(kissing him on

Okay?

JACK

JACK (CONT'D)

...we still have almost a full

trouble...

(distracted by Mintz)

...penny for your thoughts,

Alan...

ALAN

Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and

the kids I'd be home by

dinner.  You know, it being

Christmas Eve and all.

JACK

Is that tonight?

JACK (CONT'D)

You think I like being here on

Christmas Eve, Alan?

ALAN

I don't know.  Maybe...

JACK

Okay, maybe I do have a touch

of tunnel vision this holiday

season.  But in two days we're

going to announce one of the

largest mergers in U.S.

corporate history.  Thirty

billion dollars...

(basking in the glory)

When this kind of deal turns

up you get on and you ride it

`till it's over.  You don't

ask it for a vacation...

JACK (CONT'D)

(to the group)

December 26th.  After that

there'll be so much money

floating around here it'll be

like Christmas every day...

(smiling)

December 26th, people.  If

you'd like to celebrate that

day, you all have my

blessing...

ALAN

You're right, Jack.  Sorry...

Jack approaches Alan.

JACK

I don't want you to be sorry,

Alan, I want you to be

excited.  I want my gift to be

the first one you open this

year.  You know why?

ALAN

Why Jack?

JACK

Because my gift comes with ten

zeroes at the end...

JACK (CONT'D)

Good man...

Only eight thirty?  What's the

more Christmassy than

Kate Reynolds...

ADELLE

Her assistant said you could

call her at home after eight.

JACK

Her assistant?

ADELLE

Yeah Jack, her assistant...

JACK

(lost in the message)

Kate Reynolds was my

girlfriend in college.  I

almost married her...

ADELLE

(a hearty LAUGH)

You?  Married?

JACK

(snapping out of it)

Almost married.  And almost a

junior broker at E.F.

Hutton...

ADELLE

Excuse me?

JACK

She didn't want me to go to

London.  We're standing at the

airport saying goodbye and she

asks me to stay.

ADELLE

So you left her?  Just like

that?

JACK

God, no.  I thought about it

for practically the entire

flight...

ADELLE

Stop Jack, I'm getting all

weepy.

JACK

I took the road less traveled,

Adelle.

ADELLE

And look where it's led you...

(picking up the phone)

I'm gonna get her on the

phone...

JACK

No...

ADELLE

No?!  You almost married this

woman.  Aren't you even

curious what she wants?

JACK

She's probably just having a

fit of nostalgia.  You know,

lonely Christmas Eve, call the

one that got away, that kind

of thing.

JACK (CONT'D)

I'm telling you, it's ancient

history...

LASSITER

Eight forty-five on Christmas

Eve and Jack Campbell is still

at his desk.  There's a

Hallmark moment for you...

JACK

Peter.  I don't see you

rushing home to trim the tree.

LASSITER

(pouring himself

a scotch)

That's because I'm a heartless

bastard who only cares about

money.

JACK

And God love you for it.

LASSITER

(sipping the scotch)

I just got a call from Terry

Haight.  Bob Thomas is

nervous...

JACK

That'll happen when you're

about to spend thirty billion

dollars on some aspirin...

LASSITER

Someone's gonna have to nurse

him through this.

JACK

Why are you staring at my

breasts, Peter?

LASSITER

I need you, tiger..

JACK

Where is he?

LASSITER

Aspen.

JACK

(to Adelle)

Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I

won't be able to make it

tomorrow...

LASSITER

You're a credit to capitalism,

Jack.

JACK

Hey Peter, lemme ask you a

question.  An old girlfriend

calls you out of the blue on

Christmas Eve...

LASSITER

You suddenly having trouble

getting dates?

JACK

Not by a long shot.

LASSITER

Then leave it in the past.

Old flames are like old tax

returns.  You keep `em in the

file cabinet for three years

and then you cut `em loose.

JACK

(to Adelle)

I'll leave from the office

tomorrow afternoon.  Call the

group.  Schedule an emergency

strategy session for noon.

That'll be a nice little

holiday treat.

DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

JACK

No.

it to a store where the guy

behind the counter...

...doesn't have a death wish

(back to Cash)

thirty eight dollars.

Like I said, it's a business

deal...

CASH

Damn, you are the real

thing...

CASH (CONT'D)

C'mon, Jack, let's get outta

JACK

There's no way I was gonna die

in that deli...

(off Cash's look)

Let's just say I've been on a

lucky streak lately.

CASH

(a big LAUGH)

A lucky streak, huh?

CASH (CONT'D)

Sound pretty sure of yourself,

don't you?

CASH (CONT'D)

So you're telling me, you've

got a gun to your head and you

don't think for one second,

what if this, what if that,

maybe I shouldn't do this, I

shoulda done that.

JACK

I don't do that.  That's just

not for me...

CASH

Okay, Jack.  Nice doing

business with you...

Cash is about to take off...

JACK

Hey...

JACK (CONT'D)

What do you want to carry that

gun around for, anyway?

You're just gonna do something

you'll regret...

CASH

You want to talk about

regrets, you're talking to the

wrong person.

JACK

I'm just saying that you seem

like a smart guy.  At a

certain point you're gonna do

something, and then there's no

turning back...

CASH

Yeah, in most cases that'd be

true.

JACK

I mean there must be programs

out there, opportunities...

CASH

(a deep laugh)

Wait a minute, wait a

minute... you're tryin' to

save me?

Oh man, you're serious...

saved!

You just said everyone needs

something.

Wow.  It must be great being

you.  You got it all.

able to do it without some

hard work...

CASH

You still think this is about

me, don't you?

Jack, like a mantra.

ARNIE (CONTD)

Cmon, I better walk ya

home.  Shes mad enough

as it is, right...?

37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

ARNIE

Look, you fit the profile

exactly.  Thirties,

house, kids, financial

responsibilities.  You

start thinking...this

isnt the life I dreamt

about.  Wheres the

romance, wheres the joie

de vivre?  Suddenly,

every lingerie ad in the

Newark Star Ledger

represents a life you

cant have...

JACK

(thinking, then...)

Its just two kids,

right?

ARNIE

You made a choice, Jack,

a promise to your wife.

Maybe sometimes it seems

like you gave up the

world, but look what you

got...

ARNIE (CONTD)

Four bedrooms, two and a

half baths, and a

partially finished

basement...

ARNIE (CONTD)

(shaking his head)

Kids...

ARNIE (CONTD)

Okay look, you probably

dont want to hear this

right now but remember

what you told me last

summer when I almost had

that thing with Arnie

Jr.s speech therapist.

ARNIE (CONTD)

Dont screw up the best

thing in your life just

because youre a little

unsure about who you

are.  Okay?

ARNIE (CONTD)

God, it feels so good to

finally give something

back to you...

troopers looking for

you!  I called

hospitals...

(pointing at

KATE (CONTD)

What kind of man leaves

KATE (CONTD)

What kind of man does

that!?

JACK

(jumping in)

I dont know!  Please

City?  Why?

KATE (CONTD)

You missed Christmas,

Jack.

JACK

JACK

Party?  Oh no, I cant go

KATE

You look forward to this

party all year.  Whats

JACK

Trust me on this Kate.  I

really dont think going

move for me at the

present time.

KATE

Fine.  Do whatever you

JACK

What are you doing?

KATE

(laughing)

I had to go through the

So youre a lawyer...?

JACK (CONTD)

Lucky in cards, lucky in

business, lucky in love.

My cup runneth over...

(to Big Ed)

Hes a nice looking

boy...

BIG ED

My daughters no slouch

either...

POTTER

Lets cut to the chase,

Jack.  Big Ed tells me

youre the grease that

makes the wheels turn

around here.  I need a

new parts supplier for my

fleet.  You seem to have

the parts.  That we

know.  What we dont know

is why the hell I should

buy them from you.

JACK

I have no idea...

BIG ED

(nervous)

Cmon Jack...

JACK

(to Potter)

I mean it.  From what I

can tell, were a mom and

pop operation, were

already over-extended in

sales, and any price

advantage we could offer

would easily be matched

by a larger supplier...

JACK (CONTD)

So like I said, I dont

have any idea why you

should buy your parts

from us...

POTTER

Okay, you got my

attention...

JACK

Except for rule number

one...

JACK (CONTD)

The customer is always

right.  A cliche?  Sure.

The difference is, we

mean it.  Were small, we

need our customers.  We

cant afford to

disappoint them, ever.

Yeah, you could go to

some leviathan supplier,

probably save a few

pennies on the price of

oil filters, but with us

you get more than a

supplier, you get a

bridge partner...

JACK (CONTD)

You want to bid hearts,

were right there with

you.  You feel the need

to redouble, youre not

going to get any argument

from us...

JACK (CONTD)

The big guys may have the

high cards, but you know

as well as I do, Sydney,

high cards dont always

take the trick.

POTTER

CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)

...advancers led

decliners by a nine to

four ratio and the

closing tick was a mildly

bullish plus seventy

six.  Much of the

markets action today was

fueled by the latest

round of merger mania to

hit Wall Street...

CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)

...when Global Health

Systems and MedTech

Pharmaceutical announced

their intentions to join

forces in a massive one

hundred and twenty two

billion dollar stock swap

deal.  Though neither

side expressed

significant regulatory

concerns at the

announcement press

conference, it is

believed that both the

FDA and the FTC will be

closely scrutinizing the

marriage, the largest

ever in the health care

industry.  When asked

about possible anti-

competitive implications,

Global Chairman Bob

Thomas referred reporters

to P.K. Lassiter and

Company President Alan

Mintz, the original

architect behind the

deal...

CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)

met Thomas at a Lamaze

class...

JACK

A Lamaze class...!?

CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)

...while coaching their

pregnant wives, Mintz and T

homas struck up a

dialogue about the need

for consolidation in the

rapidly growing health

care industry and two

with MedTech was born...

JACK

What?!  Thats my deal?

CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)

In other business news,

U.S. Labor Department

officials announced today

that two hundred and

seventy-five thousand new

jobs were created last

month, twenty-five

thousand less than

economists were

predicting, leading to a

mild rally in the bond

markets before midday.

But as the trading

session drew to a close,

the profit takers stepped

in and the long bond

closed at ninety seven

even, up only two ticks,

the yield inching down to

six point zero seven

percent...

KATE

Shouldnt we grab some

JACK

you like.

JACK

No.

KATE

No?

JACK

Do you have any idea what

my life is like?

KATE

Excuse me?

JACK

I wake up in the morning

covered in dog saliva...I

drop the kids off, spend

eight hours selling tires

retail...retail, Kate.

JACK (CONTD)

I pick up the kids, walk

the dog, which by the

way, carries the added

bonus of carting away her

monstrous crap...I play

with the kids, take out

the garbage, get six

hours of sleep if Im

lucky, and then it starts

all over again...and why

is it that I always have

to drive everyone

everywhere?  I spend

practically my entire day

in that slow as hell

mini-van listening to

Raffi tapes and trying to

figure out how the cup

holders work...Im sick

of it.

KATE

Really.

JACK

Whats in it for me?

Where are my Mary Janes?

KATE

Its sad to hear your

life is such a

disappointment to you,

Jack.

JACK

I cant believe its not

a disappointment to you!

(letting it all out)

Jesus, Kate, I couldve

been a thousand times the

man I became.  How could

you do this to me?  How

could you let me give up

on my dreams like this?!

KATE

Who are you?

JACK

(lowering his voice)

Look, Im sorry.  Im

sorry I was such a saint

before and Im such a

prick now.  Maybe Im

just not the same guy I

was when we got

married...

KATE

Maybe youre not.  The

Jack Campbell I married

wouldnt need a $2400

suit to make himself feel

better about his life,

but if thats what its

gonna take, then buy it.

Just buy the goddamn

suit ...we can take the

money out of the kids

college fund.

KATE

Ill give you this, life

has thrown us a few

surprises...

JACK

It really has, hasnt

it?  So if you had

to...what would you say

was the biggest surprise?

KATE

Well...Annie for one.

JACK

Surprise.  Were

pregnant...

(a laugh)

Yeah...that mustve

been...I mean that was

very unexpected.  But

what are you gonna do,

right?

KATE

I think it worked out

okay, dont you?

JACK

Sure.  I really like

Annie.

KATE

Good, Jack.  Maybe well

keep her.

JACK

No, I love Annie.  We had

a lot of good times,

didnt we?

KATE

We were young...

Remember that little

You cant really raise a

kid in an apartment in

the Village...

KATE (CONTD)

The trek out to the

hospital every day didnt

help either...

(looking at him)

You were great.

Surviving the heart

attack was one thing...

JACK

You had a heart attack?

KATE

(a laugh)

Jack, stop that. I'm

still mad at you...

(a sigh)

...who knows what

wouldve happened if you

hadnt stepped in at the

store.

JACK

Thats why I work for Big

Ed?

JACK (CONTD)

(recovering)

I mean, thats why I work

for Big Ed...

JACK (CONTD)

(almost to himself)

So we had a baby, Big Ed

had a heart attack, we b

ought that house, and

Ive been working for him

ever since...Sayonara,

Wall Street.

JACK (CONTD)

(turning to her)

Our life in a nutshell...

KATE

If you want to look at it

that way...

JACK

How would you look at it?

KATE

A great success story...

JACK

Damn...

ARNIE

(O.S., from behind)

Jesus, Jack, this is a

league match, for gods

sake!

ARNIE (CONTD)

Wheres your follow

through?  Wheres your

stance?

JACK

Hey, Im doing the best I

can...

(under his breath)

Id like to see you hit a

squash ball after

seventeen beers...

ARNIE

Youre right.  Why am I

so competitive!?

Compensation, I guess.

Look, just focus, Jack.

You can still pick up the

spare...

JACK

(quietly, to

himself)

You are Jack Campbell.

Youre better than this

sport.  You shot the

rapids at Kenai.  You ran

with the bulls at

Pamplona.  You jumped out

of a plane over the

Mojave Desert, for

Christs sake.  You can

do this...

JACK (CONTD)

(screaming, excited)

Yeah!!

ARNIE

(to TEAMMATE)

Okay, Pete, youre up.

67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

EVELYN

Hi Jack...

JACK

Evelyn, right?

EVELYN

Very funny.  I saw you

out there on lane five.

What do you have the flu

or something?

JACK

Something like that.

EVELYN

(with a wink)

Need a nurse?

JACK

Youre a nurse?

EVELYN

If thats what you

want...

JACK

Wait a second...

JACK (CONTD)

Are we...?

EVELYN

Are we what, Jack?

JACK

Is there something going

on between us?

EVELYN

Are we finally being

honest?

JACK

It would help me if we

were.

EVELYN

Okay, youre right, weve

been dancing around this

for years...

EVELYN (CONTD)

God, my heart is racing.

Here goes...

(a smile)

When I get dressed for a

party and I know youre

going to be there...

well, lets just say I

dont go strapless

because my husband likes

it...

EVELYN (CONTD)

Ive got six sets of snow

tires piled up in my

garage and I wont even

drive in the snow...And

our kids just happen to

be in the same ballet

class every year?

EVELYN (CONTD)

So, if youre asking me

whether Id like it to be

more, the answer is

yes...

EVELYN (CONTD)

...and Kate would never

have to know.

JACK

Do I have your number?

EVELYN

Steves out of town with

the kids this week.  Why

dont you just stop by...

68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

ARNIE

(looking at Jack)

Hey Jack, youre all

flush.  I guess that

seventy-one took a lot

outta you.

JACK

(sitting down)

I just saw Evelyn

Thompson.

ARNIE

She is relentless.

JACK

She wants to have an

affair with me.

ARNIE

She said that?

JACK

Pretty much.

ARNIE

Oh yeah...

(shaking his head)

What is it about you?

JACK

(pushing over a

napkin)

So could you write down

her exact address?

ARNIE

Whoa...whoa...wait a

second, Jack.  Youre not

actually gonna cheat on

Kate?

JACK

It wouldnt really be

cheating...

(off Arnies

doubtful  look)

Its complicated.

ARNIE

Look, maybe Im not as

good a consigliere as you

are but you have to trust

me on this one.  A little

flirtations harmless but

youre playing with fire

here.  The Fidelity Bank

and Trust is a tough

creditor.  You make a

deposit somewhere else,

they close your account

forever.

JACK

Im telling you, those

rules dont apply to me,

Arn.

ARNIE

(a chuckle)

Screw the rules.  Im

talking about the choice.

ARNIE (CONTD)

Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons

got no class.  She

doesnt marry Dr. Steve,

the womans living in a

trailer.

JACK

Hey, is that really

necessary?

ARNIE

All Im saying it there

isnt a guy in Union

County who wouldnt give

his left nut to be

married to Kate...

ARNIE (CONTD)

Ill see ya later,

Jack...

69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

KATE

(not looking up)

How was the game, honey?

JACK

(opening the fridge)

Long, boring, and

generally pretty sad.

Arnie seemed to enjoy

it...

(peering inside)

Hey, wheres that chocolate

cake...?

KATE

(with a smile)

You mean this chocolate

cake?

JACK

Thats my piece.  I was

saving it because I got

nauseated from that store

bought chicken.

KATE

Its good...

JACK

Gimme that cake.

KATE

No way.

JACK

Cmon.

KATE

Sorry, Jack.  Its too

important to me.

JACK

I want that cake!

KATE

(laughing)

You want the cake!?

JACK

(out of breath)

I want it...

JACK (CONTD)

Thank you...

KATE

Its good, right?

JACK

Are the kids asleep?

KATE

(caught up in the

moment)

Say it, Jack...

JACK

What...?

KATE

Cmon, you know what I

like to hear...

JACK

(in the throes

of passion)

Yeah, baby, I know what

you like to hear...

KATE

(kissing him)

Then say it...just say it

to me...!

JACK

(swept up in the

moment)

Oh yeah, youre a bad

girl, baby... You make me

so hot...Im gonna take

you to that special

place...

KATE

What...?

JACK

Not it...?

KATE

Nice, Jack.  Youre

sweeping me off my feet.

JACK

What? You make me hot...

JACK (CONTD)

Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of

BILL KRAMER

Four hundred bucks at Best

Buy, Arn.

JACK

And everyone knows image

stabilization is for the

weak...

ARNIE

So Jack, its your wifes

birthday, got anything to

say to her?

JACK

(to Kate)

Its your birthday?

Today?  Whats your

name?  Where were you

born?

KATE

Jack.

JACK

Wait a minute.  Youre my

wife?

JACK (CONTD)

I do have one thing I

wanna say...

JACK (CONTD)

(singing to her)

Oh those fingers in my

hair, that sly come

hither stare, strips my

conscience bare, its

witchcraft...

JACK (CONTD)

...and Ive got no

defense for it, that heat

is too intense for it,

what good would common

sense for it do...

JACK (CONTD)

...Cause its

witchcraft, wicked

witchcraft...and although

I know its strictly

taboo...when you rouse

the need in me, my heart

says yes indeed in me,

proceed with what youre

leadin me to...

JACK (CONTD)

Its such an ancient

pitch, but one that Id

never switch, there aint

no nicer witch than

you...

JACK (CONTD)

Cause its witchcraft,

that koo koo

witchcraft...and although

I know its strictly

taboo...

JACK (CONTD)

...when you rouse the

need in me, my heart says

yes indeed to me, proceed

with what youre leadin

me to...

JACK (CONTD)

Its such an ancient

never switch...

JACK (CONTD)

Cause theres no nicer

witch than you...

planned I want you to

open mine...

JACK

Maybe I should wait...

KATE

No, open it...

KATE (CONTD)

I found it at an outlet

store.  I know its a

knock-off, but I think

itll look great on

you...

JACK

(examining the label)

Zeena...

JACK (CONTD)

(tearing up)

You really are

incredible...

KATE

Enjoy it, sweetheart...

JACK

Youre probably expecting

something from me...

JACK (CONTD)

Heres the thing.  I

really hadnt planned on

giving you your...uh...

anniversary gift until

tonight.

(an uncomfortable

smile)

You know, anniversarys

good all day...

KATE

What are you talking

about?  You never wait

all day.  You can barely

wait until its light

out.

JACK

I know that, but...

KATE

You forgot.

KATE (CONTD)

You actually forgot our

anniversary.

JACK

Ill fix it.  Ill go out

right now and get you

something.  Ill make it

right.

KATE

(holding back

the tears)

Jesus, Jack...Is this

where we are now?  Is

this our marriage?

Suddenly Im the wife who

has to drop hints two

weeks before her

anniversary so her

husband doesnt fuck it

up?

JACK

Please dont cry...

KATE

I dont want to be that,

Jack...

77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

ANNIE

Not bad...I shoulda

warned you.  Dad always

does something really

special for their

anniversary.

JACK

Like what?

ANNIE

One year he had a solar

system named after her...

JACK

Dont you think thats a

little gimmicky?

ANNIE

Mom liked it.

JACK

Maybe theres a jewelry

store back at the mall.

I could get her a pair of

earrings or something.

ANNIE

Thats good but...you did

forget the anniversary.

JACK

Right.  Thats a major

oversight...

(thinking aloud)

So if Im Kate...I cant

really afford the finer

things, my husbands

career is a crushing

disappointment to me,

Im trapped in suburbia...

JACK (CONTD)

Did he ever take her to

the City?

ANNIE

Youre really gettin the

hang of this.

JACK

Whats the difference?

Im taking my baby out

WAITER

Very good, sir.  And may

I say those are all

excellent selections.

JACK

You may...

(perusing the

wine list)

Also, well have a bottle

of Lafite, 1982.

KATE

Its five hundred and

fifty dollars, Jack!

JACK

Just a glass of red wine

for each of us...

KATE

You are so not off the

hook yet, slick.

JACK

But Im gettin close, right?

JACK (CONTD)

You want to dance?

KATE

I dont think theres

dancing here, Jack.

JACK

Sure there is...

KATE

Jack)

Pretty good for a tire

salesman from Jersey...

JACK

I have my moments...

83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

KATE

Mmmm...

(spearing a scallop)

...here, try one of

these...

JACK

(savoring the scallop)

God I missed that

taste...

JACK (CONTD)

Why are you laughing?

JACK (CONTD)

I need to tell you

something.

KATE

Okay...

JACK

I think it may help us

but theres a slight

chance it could make

things worse.

KATE

Now Im worried...just

say it.  Whatever it is

well deal with it.

JACK

Are you sure?

JACK (CONTD)

I feel like Im living

someone elses life...

JACK (CONTD)

I used to be so sure

about everything, you

know?  I knew exactly who

I was and what I wanted.

Then one morning I woke

up and suddenly it was

all different...

KATE

Worse, you mean...

JACK

No.  Well, maybe a few

things.  But mostly just

different...

JACK (CONTD)

I never used to be like

this, Kate.  I had it all

figured out.  No doubts,

no regrets.

KATE

And now...?

JACK

Now...I dont...

KATE

Me neither.

KATE (CONTD)

I think its good to be a

little unsure about who

you are.  Its very

human.

JACK

But you always seem so

certain.

KATE

Cmon, Jack, you think

there arent mornings

when I wake up and wonder

what the hell Im doing

in New Jersey...

JACK

Thats a big one for me,

too.

KATE

My office is a dump, I

answer my own phone...and

youve seen my pay check.

JACK

Your pay check is a

disgrace to pay checks.

KATE

I mean yes, I help people

that need it...

JACK

I guess...some of them

are probably faking.

KATE

(a laugh, then...)

God, sometimes I think it

would be so nice not to

have to stretch ground

beef or maybe drive a car

with a CD player...

KATE (CONTD)

Imagine having a life

where everything was

easy...where you asked

for things and people

just brought them to

you...

JACK

Its wonderful...

KATE

I think about it, too,

Jack.  I do.  I think

about the kind of person

Id be if I hadnt

married you...

JACK

And...?

KATE

And I realize Ive just

erased the things in my

life Im most sure

about.  You, the kids...

JACK

Good things...

KATE

What are you sure about?

JACK

Im sure that right now

theres nowhere Id

rather be than here with

you...

Id bet anything it

had a pussycat running

Mr. Mintz.

ALAN

Please, call me Alan. We

try to cultivate a casual

atmosphere around here...

JACK

(re: play pen)

I can see that, Alan.

ALAN

You have kids, Jack?

JACK

(hesitating, then...)

Uh...actually, yes. Two...

good ones.

ALAN

Thats great...

(gesturing to

the sofa)

Why dont you have a seat?

ALAN (CONTD)

So, Peter mentioned that

you were an avid CNBC

watcher but didnt say

whether you had any

actual Wall Street

experience?

JACK

I was a sales associate,

at E.F. Hutton.

ALAN

A broker? Really. And now

youre in the tire

business?

JACK

Thats right. And auto

supply...

ALAN

Uh huh. The retail end, I

understand.

JACK

Uh...we actually get about

sixty percent of our

business from automotive

service.

ALAN

Mind if I ask what kind of

sales you did last year?

Ballpark...

JACK

We did one point seven

million in total revenue...

ALAN

Uh huh...one point seven.

And what do you project for

this year?

ALAN (CONTD)

Any thoughts at all on

that?

ALAN (CONTD)

Jack?

JACK

Well, Alan, I think were

gonna have a banner year.

Sales are up almost

twenty percent in the

first quarter and we just

landed a major trucking

company account.

ALAN

Really. So youre

projecting what, a tad

over two million?

JACK

Thats right. And that

would make us number one

in our market...

(getting up)

You mind if I stand?

JACK (CONTD)

Look, I know our paltry

little two million in

sales is about what you

spend on office supplies

in a year.  And I know

some regional trucking

company account is

nothing compared to a

sixty billion dollar

merger...

ALAN

Im not trying to knock

the tire business, Jack.

JACK

(a confident chuckle)

Its okay, Alan. I get it.

Im in your shoes, Im

thinking exactly the same

thing...but heres the

thing. Business is

business.  Wall Street,

Main Street, its all

just a bunch of people

getting up in the morning,

trying to figure out how

the hell theyre gonna

send their kids to

college.  Its just

people...

JACK (CONTD)

And I know people.

ALAN

Im sure you do...

LASSITER

(intervening)

Lets let the man have

his say...

JACK

(to Mintz)

Take you, for instance...

ALAN

(defensive)

What about me?

JACK

You drink about sixteen

Diet Cokes a day. Youre

an excellent father, but

you feel guilty about the

time you spend away from

home. You drink bourbon,

but you offer your

clients scotch...

JACK (CONTD)

And your wife decorated

this office...

LASSITER

He certainly has your

number, Alan.

JACK

(turning to Lassiter)

Youre a little tougher,

Peter.

JACK (CONTD)

For one thing, you like

expensive things.

LASSITER

(smiling proudly)

Thats easy. Youve seen

my car.

JACK

(a chuckle)

Okay...you smoke Hoyo de

Monterreys. Youre a

scotch man, single malt,

not because its trendy

but because youve been

doing it for forty years,

and you stay with what

works. You have two great

loves in your life, your

horses and this company.

You wept openly the day

the Dow hit ten thousand...

JACK (CONTD)

And youre a man who

prides himself on finding

talent in unusual

places...

LASSITER

Oh? And how would you

know that?

JACK

Because Im here.

JACK (CONTD)

Im prepared to do

anything it takes to get

this job. Start anywhere

you need me to start.

Ill park cars if I

to...

(into Lassiters

eyes)

The biggest part of

judging character is

knowing yourself. And I

know this, I can do this

job. Give me a chance,

Peter, I wont let you

down.

LASSITER

Alan, why dont you show

Jack around a bit...

ALAN

Id love to.

JACK

Seven.  Really.

ALAN

Lets cut the shit, huh

Campbell? What, did you go

through his wallet or

something?

ALAN (CONTD)

No matter. That circus

act back there may have

dazzled Lassiter

momentarily but it

doesnt do shit forme.

Even if you get this job,

which I highly doubt, let

me warn you, Lassiter

loses interest in his pet

projects very quickly.

Im in the big office

because Ive proved

myself to him year after

year and nobody is going

to come in here and start

turning the old mans

head. Especially not some

tire salesman from New

Jersey. So you watch

yourself and stay away

from Lassiter, and maybe,

just maybe, Ill keep you

on after he gets tired of

you. Do we understand

each other?

ALAN (CONTD)

Do we?!

JACK

God, you really are

different, arent you...

(nodding)

I mean...wow...I am

impressed.

JACK (CONTD)

Good for you. Why shouldnt

you protect whats yours.

ALAN

I dont think youre hearing

me.

JACK

Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.

Thats not the problem.

The problem is that what

you think is yours, is

really mine.  And I dont

care how low on the totem

pole I start, I will get

it back...

(poking him in

the chest)

So do yourself a favor and

dont get too attached to

that view because sometime

soon, maybe very soon, you

and your French country

antiques, your chintz sofa,

and your little play pen

are gonna be moving out of

that office.

JACK (CONTD)

Oh, and by the way, you

try selling tires for a

living.  I promise you,

youd starve.

101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

JACK

Welcome to Xanadu...

JACK (CONTD)

Pretty incredible, isnt

it?

KATE

Its like a museum.

KATE (CONTD)

(turning to Jack)

So whats the big

surprise? You didnt

rent this place for

the weekend, did you?

JACK

Think bigger.

KATE

For the week?

JACK

This place is a perk,

Kate.

KATE

A perk for what?

JACK

A company called P.K.

Lassiter and Associates

Investment House uses it

to attract new

executives...

JACK (CONTD)

Youre talking to their

new Vice President of

Mergers and Acquisitions.

KATE

What are you talking

about, Jack?

JACK

Im going into arbitrage,

honey.  Turns out I have

a knack for it.  Ill be

making two hundred grand

a year plus a hefty bonus

and thats just to

start.  And, we can live

in this apartment

practically rent free for

as long as we want.

JACK (CONTD)

We can finally afford to

move back into the city.

In style.

KATE

Are you out of your mind?

JACK

I dont think so. This

is going to be a better

life for all of us,

honey.  Well put Annie

and Josh in private

schools...

KATE

Annie goes to a great

school.

JACK

Im talking about the

best schools in the

country here, Kate...

KATE

Jack, what could you

possibly be thinking?

What about my job?

JACK

This is New York City,

its like the needy

people capital of the

world.  Those Jersey

clients of yours arent a

tenth as pathetic as the

ones you could get

here...

KATE

(cutting him off)

I cant believe you want

to move back into the

city.  I thought the

reason we left was

because we didnt want to

raise the kids here?

JACK

No, this is the center of

the universe.  If I were

living in Roman times, I

would live in Rome, where

else?  Today, America is

the Roman Empire and New

York is Rome itself.

John Lennon.

KATE

(cutting him off)

Jack.

JACK

Look, Im detecting a

kind of funky tension

here...We dont have to

live in this apartment.

I dont need this...Ill

commute...Ill drive to

work...

KATE

In traffic?  Its over an

hour each way?  Thats

almost three hours a

day.  When are you going

to see the kids?

JACK

Kate. Youre not

understanding me. Im

talking about a great

life.  A perfect life.

Everything we pictured

when we were young. The

whole package. You said

it yourself, life has

thrown us surprises, and

so we made sacrifices.

But now I can finally get

us back on track...

JACK (CONTD)

I can do that.  I want to

do that.  For all of us.

I need to do that as a

man...

(imploring her)

Think about it.  No more

lousy restaurants, no

more clipping coupons, no

more shoveling snow...

KATE

Then get a goddamn snow

blower!

KATE (CONTD)

Dont get a new career

without even telling me.

Dont take Annie out of a

school she loves.  Dont

move us out of a house

weve become a family

in...

KATE (CONTD)

(quietly)

Dont do that...

JACK

Look, youre making this

into something its not.

This isnt a referendum

on our lives, Kate. Its

a step forward...

(appealing to her)

Dont you see?  Im

talking about us finally

having a life other

people envy.

KATE

They already do envy us,

Jack...

JACK

From London to New York...?

(looking up)

I came back...

KATE

Our finest moment,

right...

KATE (CONTD)

When you got on that

plane I was sure it was

over.  I left the airport

afraid Id never see you

again.  And then you

showed up the very next

day...

(a wistful smile)

That was a good

surprise...

KATE (CONTD)

I think about you on that

plane, about what must

have been going through

your mind...you sitting

there imagining our life

together, our life

apart...I think about the

decision you made...

KATE (CONTD)

Maybe I was being naive

but I believed wed grow

old together in this

house.  That wed spend

holidays here, have g

randchildren visit us

here.  I had this image

of us all grey and

wrinkly, me working in

the garden, you

repainting the deck...

KATE (CONTD)

Things change, right?

People change...

(pausing)

If you need this, Jack, I

mean really need this, I

will take these children

from a life they love,

and take myself from the

only home weve ever

shared, and move wherever

you need to go.  Ill do

that because I love

you...

KATE (CONTD)

I love you, Jack. And

thats more important to

me than our address...

KATE (CONTD)

I choose us.

KATE

Are you okay, Jack?

JACK

Thank god, Jacks here. Ill

ALAN (CONTD)

Jack, are you okay?

JACK

(in a daze)

Whats going on here?

ALAN

Its not good.  Bob Thomas

has secretly been talking to

a European drug company.

Were not sure which one,

Julias on it right now.

Word is theyre willing to

let him buy a minority stake

and keep running the entire

company.  The Global people

are up in arms.  They say

we shouldve been prepared

for this.  Were in trouble

here, Jack...

JACK

You know something, Alan.

Theres a much more assertive

person somewhere inside of

you...

ALAN

Excuse me?

JACK

But I think I like you better

this way...

ALAN

Is this another one of those

Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

JACK

No.

ALAN

So what are we gonna do,

Jack?

ALAN (CONTD)

Jack...?

JACK

Ill tell you exactly what

were going to do.  Youre

going to do whatever you

have to do to find out which

European company hes been

talking to.  Then Im going

to clean myself up, fly to

Aspen, and drink egg nog

with Bob Thomas.  His wife

and kids will be playing in

the background while I spend

Christmas day convincing him

that the European company is

the devil and Global is the

answer to his prayers, after

all...

(growing wistful)

Then Im going to spend four

hours skiing. Alone. On

Christmas day. Completely

and utterly alone. Im going

to do that because that is

my life, that is whats

real, and there is nothing

I can do to change that...

Im moving to Paris...it was

Salvation Army...

JACK

Paris?

LORI

(to Kate, with

attitude)

Do you want me to look for

the box or call the airline?

KATE

Hey, kind of under a little

pressure here.

LORI

Hey, kind of giving up

Christmas day for my ex-boss

here.

KATE

You didnt seem to mind

offering to help me on

Christmas day when you were

unwrapping that Prada bag

I gave you.

LORI

Maybe its by the wardrobe

boxes...

JACK

Youre moving...

KATE

Uh huh. To Paris. My firm

has an office there and

Im going to be heading

it up.

JACK

(stunned)

To Paris. Paris, France.

KATE

(searching the

boxes)

Thats the one...

JACK

So youre not at a non-

profit firm?

KATE

(a chuckle)

Not with what they pay me...

JACK

Youre not married, are

you?

KATE

No, Jack, I never got

married. You?

JACK

Not exactly...

(looking around)

Can we just take a minute

here?  Maybe get a cup of

coffee or something...?

LORI

(yelling)

Ill go for a cup of coffee!

KATE

Yes!

KATE (CONTD)

I found it!

LORI

Congratulations. The La

Guardia flights canceled

but I got you out of

Kennedy on United at nine.

Am I good or what?

KATE

Here you go.  Its just

some old things of yours...

JACK

Do you ever think about us,

Kate?  About what might

have happened...?

JACK

Please. Lets just go have

a cup of coffee. Thats all

Im asking for. Im sure

theres another flight to

Paris tonight.

KATE

What do you want from me?

You want me to tell you

everything that happened

was okay?

KATE (CONTD)

Well it is. Yes, I was

heartbroken ...But I got

over it. I moved on.

People change, Jack. I

changed. I dont know

why you suddenly feel the

need to revisit that time

in our lives but I assure

you, its over...

JACK

(at Kate)

We have a house in Jersey!

KATE

Dont do this, Jack...

But he continues...

JACK

We have two kids, Annie and

Josh...

JACK (CONTD)

...Annies not much of a

violin player but she

tries really hard. Shes a

little precocious but thats

only because she says whats

on her mind. And when she

smiles...

JACK (CONTD)

And Josh...he has your eyes.

He doesnt say much but we

know hes smart...

(lost in the memory)

...hes always got his eyes

open, always watching us...

sometimes you can look at

him and just know that hes

learning something new...

its like witnessing a

miracle...

JACK (CONTD)

...the house is a mess, but

its ours...

(chuckling)

...well, after a hundred

twenty two more payments

it will be...

JACK (CONTD)

And you...youre a non-

profit lawyer. Thats right,

completely non-profit. But

that doesnt seem to bother

you...

JACK (CONTD)

And were in love. After

thirteen years of marriage

were still unbelievably

in love...

(with a chuckle)

You wont even let me touch

you until Ive said it...

JACK (CONTD)

...I sing to you...not all

the time but definitely on

special occasions...

JACK (CONTD)

(off hand, to passenger)

Excuse me...

(to Kate)

We made a lot of sacrifices,

dealt with our share of

surprises, but we stayed

together...

JACK (CONTD)

You see, youre a better

person than I am...

JACK (CONTD)

...and it made me a better

person to be around you...

JACK (CONTD)

Maybe it was all a

dream. Maybe I went to

bed one lonely night in

December and imagined it

all. But I swear,

nothings ever felt more

real to me...

JACK (CONTD)

And if you get on that

plane right now, itll

disappear forever.

JACK (CONTD)

I know we can both go on

with our lives. And wed

both be fine. But Ive

seen what we can be like

together...And I choose

us...

JACK (CONTD)

Please, Kate, one cup of

coffee. You can always go

to Paris. Just please, not

tonight...

KATE

Okay, Jack...
