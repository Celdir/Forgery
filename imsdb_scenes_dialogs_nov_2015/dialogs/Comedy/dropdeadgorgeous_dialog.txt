A DOCUMENTARY FILM CREW WAS SENT TO

A SMALL TOWN IN MINNESOTA

TO COMMEMORATE THIS OCCASSION.

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Sarah Rose knows you're a beautiful

person....

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (cont'd)

Sarah Rose knows you have an unusual

talent.  Sarah Rose knows you're a

teenage girl.

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (cont'd)

Mmm, and she definitely knows that you

are ready for the ultimate teen

glamour.

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER

(cont'd)

The American Teen Princess Pageant.

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (cont'd)

And now, a few words...

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (cont'd)

...from last year's host, Mr. Adam

West.

ADAM WEST

The American Teen Princess Pageant has

been enriching the lives of American-

made girls since 1945.

ADAM WEST (cont'd)

The American Teen Princess Pageant

provides personal growth, scholarship,

travel, and you...

ADAM WEST (cont'd)

...might even meet a few celebrities.

At the national level, thousands of

seventeen year-old girls like

yourselves. and compete around the

country in places like:

MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER

(O.S.)

Beautiful Mount Rose, Minnesota.

ADAM WEST

And make it all the way here to

Lincoln, Alabama, to compete for the

title of American Teen Princess.

ADAM WEST (cont'd)

And now, a few words from last year's

host, Mr. Adam West.

ADAM WEST (cont'd)

(pointing to camera)

So, which one of you will it b--

GLADYS LEEMAN

Good God, Iris, you taped your shows

over it.

IRIS

Sorry.

GLADYS LEEMAN

Now ladies, the rest of the tape -

which is now gone forever - goes on

about startin' this great American

journey we call American Teen

Princess...Yah-so, any of you young

ladies who'd like to start on that

journey, you just come right down here

and sign up.  And please...help

yourselves to some coffee and bars...

SMASH EDIT TO:

GLADYS

Showtime.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Do you think that most people would

say that teenage beauty pageants are a

good idea?

GLADYS

Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your

big city, no bra wearin', hairy-legged

women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-

fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to

the girls --

IRIS

(jumping in)

What's sick is women dressin' like

men!

GLADYS

Uh... You betcha, Iris.

(quickly, back to camera)

Yah-I think yous boys'll find that

things are different here in Mount

Rose...

GLADYS (cont'd)

For one thing, y'know, we're God

fearin' folk - every last one of us...

GLADYS (cont'd)

You won't find a back room in our

video store...

GLADYS (cont'd) (V.O.)

...that filth is better left in the

"Sin Cities."

IRIS

A.k.a. Minneapolis - St. Paul.

ELDERLY MAN (MAYOR)

Oh, yah-sure, Freda, yah.  She was the

oldest livin' Lutheran.  Now she's

dead as a doornail.  It's them damn

Shriners who ain't taken that Goddamn

sign down yet - those lazy sons-a-

bitches...

I tells kem, I tells kem every goddamn

year, "Take the Goddamn Freda sign

down, you lazy sons-a-bitches!"

GLADYS

...Today's "To Do" list includes a

trip to the Mall of America.  We need

outfits for the "Physical Fitness"

number --

IRIS

Nothin' too showy!

GLADYS

Y'betcha, Iris.  We still need a third

judge and we need to think of a theme.

IRIS

Gladys -- Gladys!  Look out!

GLADYS

Oh, my!

(waving out window)

Hello, Father Donigan!  Sidewalks,

sidewalks?

GLADYS (cont'd)

Iris, stop!

(to camera)

It's not his fault.  The communal wine

just proves too temptin' for some of

them.

IRIS

That's why we Lutherans use grape

Koolaid for the blood of Christ.

IRIS

Oh, there's a parking space over

there.  Oh, no, that's just a compact.

Sorry.

GLADYS

You'd think they'd build the parking

lot of America to go with the Mall of

America!

IRIS

It's a two-hundred dollar fine!

GLADYS

I said I'd move if a cripple came.

Let's just run in the store and pick

out some outfits.

IRIS

All right, let's go.

GLADYS

Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

Wait!  I just thought of the theme.

IRIS

Oh!  What is it?

GLADYS (cont'd)

"Proud...to be...an...American."

JUMP CUT TO:

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So what was the theme of the pageant

last year?

GLADYS

Last year?  It was, "Buy American."

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

And the year before that?

GLADYS

"U.S.A. is A-okay."

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Can you remember the theme of your

favorite pageant?

GLADYS

"Can I?  I'm Amer-I-Can!"  People ask

me where I get this.  I don't know,

it's...maybe a gift from God or

somethin'.

LESLIE MILLER

...Hi.

(giggles)

I'm Leslie Miller.  I'm signin' up

kcause-ah, y'know, I always watch

pageants on the TV and my boyfriend

thinks I'll win.

LESLIE MILLER (cont'd)

For my talent, I'm gonna be doing

the..

LESLIE (cont'd)

Uh, Pat, I'm trying to tell themabout

my...Oh...

CUT TO:

LESLIE MILLER (cont'd)

Hi, Pat!  Go, Muskies!  Whoo!

AMBER ATKINS

(suddenly looking O.C.)

Hi, I-I'm Amber Atkins and, um, I'm

signin' up k'cause, ah, my two

favorite people in the world competed.

My mom and Diane Sawyer...Course I

hope I end up a little more like Diane

Sawyer than my mom...

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Do you do any of the, uh, embalming?

AMBER

(laughing)

Oh, my God, no.  Oh, God.  I just do

the hair and makeup on the deceased.

AMBER (V.O.)

I'm lucky I have an after-school job

where I can practice my talent.

GLADYS

Oh, yeah, sure.  You know, every

pageant is special, but this one is

extra-special to me.  When I was

seventeen, I don't know if you know

this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's

American Teen Princess.  And this

year...drum roll please, my lovely

daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is

competin'.

BECKY

Is this my mark?

(it is)

Hi, I'm Rebecca Leeman.  And I believe

this pageant is an important

experience for every young woman.  It,

well, it teaches you what's really

important in life, and it has the

power to change you in ways you've

never dreamed of.

BECKY

(yelling over noise)

...What?!  Klinghagen thinks it'll all

come down to me and Amber?

BECKY (cont'd)

Well, you have to take everything Mrs.

Klinghagen says with a grain of salt.

Not all your Catholics go to communion

for the wafers, if you know what I

mean...

JUMP CUT TO:

BECKY

...Yah-my mom gave me this nine-mil

for my thirteenth birthday...

I'll always remember what she wrote in

the card.  "Jesus loves winners."

That's why, no matter what I do...

BECKY (cont'd)

I aim to win.

LISA

Why?  Well, uh, it's kind of like

askin', "Why do all the guys chew

Copenhagen?"  You know?  I mean, if

you're seventeen and you're not a

total fry, it's just what you do.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Have you decided what your talent is

going to be yet?

LISA

I'm gonna sing and dance to, "New

York, New York."  See, I fell in love

with The Big Apple last summer when I

was visitin' my brother.  He followed

his dream to New York.

LISA (cont'd)

This is Peter as Liza.  This is him as

Madonna.  Oh, here's me with him as

Barbara...

TESS

Uh... I don't know what my talent's

gonna be yet...

TESS (cont'd)

Kenny.  Kenny, come.  Come, Kenny.

TESS (cont'd)

This is Kenny.  Spike, my German

Shepherd, went to live with a nice

family on a farm after he attacked me.

It wasn't his fault.  I had beef jerky

in my front pocket.

(pulling up shirt)

They re-made my belly with skin from

my butt.

DISSOLVE TO:

IONA HILDERBRANTDT

(smoked for sixty years)

I was Mount Rose American Teen

Princess in 1945.  We were at war with

the Japs.

IONA HILDERBRANTDT (V.O.)

(cont'd)

I didn't even get to keep my damn

tiara.

IONA HILDERBRANTDT (cont'd)

Had to turn it in for scrap.

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. HOWARD

(heavy accent)

... So we adopt Molly three year ago

when we come to America, to help

acclimate us to American.

MOLLY

(smiling)

To America, Dad.

MRS. HOWARD

She all-American girl.  She our

American Teen Princess girl.

MOLLY

Oh, Mom...

TINA

(in Japanese)

Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we

moving back to Tokyo?  I can't stand

this place anymore.  They put butter

on everything.

MR. HOWARD

(turning, suddenly angry)

English!  English, you stupid little

retard!  We America now, Tina!

TINA

(perfect English)

I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due

respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's

Seiko.

MR. HOWARD

Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!

MRS. HOWARD

"Robert," settle down.

MR. HOWARD

(screaming)

AHHHHHH!

JUMP CUT TO:

TINA

Mom, I just finished the third

movement of that concerto I was

working on.  I put, like, this techno

beat on this Japanese folk tune -

wanna hear it?

MR. HOWARD

(running down the hall)

No!  We not like to hear it!  Go to

your room and shut up!

TINA

Oh, I almost forgot...

(removing envelope from

pocket)

I got my acceptance to Tokyo

University.

MR. HOWARD

What, you deaf?  I say shut up-shut up-

SHUT UP!

(coming at camera)

Cut her outta this!

JUMP CUT TO:

MR. HOWARD

Now Molly, tell movie man what you

talent do.

MOLLY

(giving thumbs up)

Country western!

MRS. HOWARD

Clint Black!  Ruff!

MR. HOWARD

Hey, what he got I not got?

MICHELLE

... Yah-I'll be performing a dramatic

monologue.

MICHELLE (cont'd)

Right now, I'm thinkin' "Othello"

or...

"Soylent Green."  Lots of girls make a

smooth transition from pageants into

actin', y'know.

SMASH CUT TO:

CONNIE

Competin' for the title of Minnesota's

American Teen Princess sure was

excitin'.  But, I never coulda won

without my...

CONNIE (cont'd)

St. Paul Pork Products!

CONNIE (cont'd)

I've been enjoyin' St. Paul Pork

Products for years.  I grew up right

next to these stock yards.

CONNIE (cont'd)

It's still the same family-run

business that Walter and Vera Polarski

started in 1920 when they raised and

slaughtered their first pig.

CONNIE (cont'd)

Mmm-mmmm.  I just love St. Paul Pork

Products.  In fact, I love kem so much

CONNIE (cont'd)

I work here now!

JANELLE

(slow, due to signing)

...My talent will be an interpretive

dance while I sing, "Through the Eyes

of Love."  I have a dream of spreadin'

sign language around the world... Mom?

Would you be so kind?

JANELLE (cont'd)

Yeah.  Well, see, uh, I have a dream

of spreading sign language around the

world.

(to Mrs. Betz)

Mom, would you be so kind.

TAMMY CURRY

Tammy Curry.  I'm signin' up for the

scholarship'n'all.

SMASH CUT TO:

TAMMY CURRY (cont'd)

...This one's for Varsity Soccer, uh,

I'm captain.

(pointing)

I run track, and, uh...

(points to small gun patch)

Right here, I'm the new President of

the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club...

TAMMY CURRY (cont'd) (O.S.)

I love that one.

DOCUMENTARIAN (V.O.)

Would you say you have a good chance

to win this pageant?

TAMMY (V.O.)

Yeah, you bet I do.  I mean, maybe

other people think I can't win a

beauty pageant.  But other people

didn't think I could beat out Becky

Leeman for President of the gun club,

either.  And I did.  I-I-It's just

like Anthony Robbins says, "I'm a

winner.  Nobody can stop me but me!"

GLADYS

Well, you know, I think everyone's

doing really well considering the fact

that she was so young.

IRIS

It's always hard to see the young ones

called home, especially on an

exploding thresher.  It's just so odd

and gross.

GLADYS

You know that sometimes it's hard to

understand God's great plan.

IRIS

Yeah.

FEMALE MOURNER #1

May I have a tissue?

GLADYS

But the show must go on.

(she faces Iris)

I gotta get a hold of Ted and ask him

if we can use that barn light as a

spot again.  So you watch the Jell-o

salad, okay?

IRIS

All right.  Okay.

FRY GIRL #1

...Oh, yeah-right.  I ain't gonna be

in no goddamn pageant!  Look what

happened to that dork-ass farm girl.

PREGNANT FRY GIRL (O.C.)

Tammy Curry?

FRY GIRL #1

Yah-yah.  Everyone says this is a big

accident?  She got iced because she

wins everything, and this time someone

didn't want her to win.

PREGNANT FRY GIRL

This pageant's like a roach motel.

FRY GIRL #1

Girls check in, but they don't check

out.

PREGNANT FRY GIRL

Yeah.  And they say smokin' is bad for

your health.

FRY GIRL #1

(raising cigarette into

frame)

Yeah.

CHLORIS

And tendu.  Close.  Tendu.  Close.

Tendu.  Close.  Plie.  And repeat.

Suck in the belly, girls, and tuck in

the tushes!

CHLORIS (cont'd)

Close those legs!  You look like a

bunch of bowlegged cows!  Other side.

And...tendu.  Close.  Tendu.  Close.

Tendu.  Close.  Plie.

CUT TO:

CHLORIS (cont'd)

Yeah, you boys sure picked a good

year.  If I was a betting woman, and

there was a line on this in Vegas, I'd

lay down ten-to-one that it all comes

down to Amber Atkins and Becky Leeman.

Oh, sweet Jesus, what a showdown this

could be if Cain and Abel...

LISA

Ow!  Oh, God.  It's so em-so

embarrassing.

MARY (V.O.)

(labored breaths)

My winning...the Mount Rose...

MARY

...American Teen Princess Pageant...

MARY (cont'd)

...really changed my life.

MARY

(labored breaths)

...Amber does my hair...once a week.

AMBER

(flattered and embarrassed)

Well...it's the least I can do for the

reigning Mount Rose Junior Miss Amer--

AMBER (cont'd)

Oh God...

MARY

What?

AMBER

Huh?  Oh...Uh, just a little snarl...

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

There we go.

MARY

(delusional)

Beautiful... Maybe next week... a

perm.

AMBER

Yah... sure...

BECKY

Hellooo, Little Mary Sunshine!

(pretending to notice camera)

What?!  Oh-oh my God!  Lights!

Camera!  And me without a stitch of

make-up on.  What are you guys doin'

here?

AMBER

What're you doin' here?

BECKY

Oh, Amber, like you're the only one

who visits Mary.

MARY

(to Becky)

Who are you?

BECKY

(covering)

"Who are you?!"  Oh Mary, you kill me.

(to camera)

She always says that.  It's a little

game we play.  Every week - same dippy

little look on her face.  "Who are you

- who are you?"  Just like that.

(in Mary's face)

It's me - Becky - and I brought your

favorites.

AMBER

How nice, Becky, she's anorexic.

BECKY

(sotto, reprimanding tone)

She's skinny, not deaf, Amber.

AMBER

... Dreams?  Yah-sure I got kem...

Sometimes I dream of winnin'... I

dream of gettin' outta Mount Rose and

bein' a big time reporter like Diane

Sawyer.  I mean, guys get outta Mount

Rose all the time for hockey

scholarships or prison.  But the

pageant's kinda my only chance.

AMBER

... Yah-1963.  Her beauty worked

against her when she started as a

reporter in Louisville, her hometown.

Those were different times.

ANNETTE (O.S.)

(yelling, coughing)

Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?

AMBER

(smiling)

That's my mom.

(yelling)

I'll get kem in a sec.

ANNETTE

(surprised by cameras)

Oh shit!

AMBER

They're from L.A.  They wanted to see

my room and film me for their movie.

ANNETTE

(mock-touched, to crew)

Oh... How quickly they grow up.

(exiting, smiling)

Hey, if they ask you to take off your

shirt, get the money first.

ANNETTE (cont'd) (O.S.)

And go get my smokes!

JUMP CUT TO:

LESTER

...You betcha.  S'posed to be colder-n-

a witches tit tonight...

GLADYS

(nervous laugh)

Oh, Lester.  He loves his weather,

y'know.

LESTER

(looking to crew, O.S.)

Hey, ya like it?  Open it...Yah-the

globe.  Pull at the equator there.

GLADYS

We're not in the showroom, Dear.

LESTER

Fits three full-size booze bottles.

The cassette deck pulls outta

Afghanistan, there.

BECKY

(embarrassed)

Mommm...

GLADYS

Lester?

LESTER

Oh, all right

(to camera)

How soon they forget where all this

comes from.

BECKY

Japan.

LESTER

That's enough, young lady.

JUMP CUT TO:

GLADYS

"Impartial?"  Outside this house I'm

Gladys Leeman, President, Civil

Servettes - impartial as the day is

long.  But we're inside my home now

and I've gotta warn you, I'm wearin'

my "wife apron" and "mom hat."  So, I

can safely say that I'm the mother of

the most talented contestant Mount

Rose has ever seen.

JUMP CUT TO:

GLADYS

I'll field that one - Rebecca's saving

her voice.

GLADYS (cont'd)

You-betcha, Rebecca's ready.  She's

been singin' and dancin' since she was

knee high to a pig's eye.

LESTER

Yah-she's damn near as good as that

little black fella - with the glass

eye.

GLADYS

Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.

LESTER

Yeah, yeah, the Jew.

BECKY

Nice one, Dad.  He's dead.

GLADYS

...Yah-then, for the "Judges

Interview," each girl has a ten minute

get-together with the judges before

the pageant...

GLADYS

Yes, the Judges Interview.. Each girl

has a ten minute get-together with the

judges prior to the pageant.  Then we

have the...

GLADYS (cont'd)

Hello, Tony.

TONY

Hey.

GLADYS

"Hey" to the folks.

TONY

Yeah, all right.

IRIS

The Judges Interview.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So you've, uh, you've judged a lot of

pageants over the years?

JOHN

Nope.  No.  Uh-uh.  Never judged a

pageant before in my life.  Nope.  No

way.  Never around young girls.  Even

if I was, why would I wanna be,

y'know?  I-I-I don't get off on that

kinda thing and that's really why

you're askin', right?  S-someone say

somethin'?

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

HAROLD

Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly

trap.

HANK

HAROLD

Don't make me kick-ya where the good

Lord split-ya.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So are you excited?

HAROLD

...Oh you betcha!  We're happier than

the day Hanky got acquitted.  I get

made a judge, then the furniture store

hires us to paint the whole damn

thing.

(removing cap)

We're gonna use the money to get our

mamma a proper headstone.  Oh, and

move her out to the cemetery.

LESTER

Hey Tim, Carla - if yous kids don't

try to Jew me down none, I'll throw in

LESTER (cont'd)

See, that there's my specialty.  Don't

JOHN

Oh, this is just a...camera.  I keep

BECKY

So, Brett, do you wanna go to the lake

Um, actually, I got practice on

ANNETTE

Don't fall for it.  She lives two

So?  Be real easy.

ANNETTE

Go on home, Loretta.  Come on.  Go on,

the party's over.

LORETTA

Anyone?

AMBER (cont'd)

(surprised)

Ahhh!  Je-sus-Christ-on-a-cross!

(catching breath)

Look, number one rule in a funeral

home - never sneak up on the livin'.

You never know who could have an

embalming needle or skull saw in their

hand.  Mr. Larson's son learned that

the hard way - he's buried next to my

Grandpa!

JUMP CUT TO:

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

AMBER

(covering real emotions)

Upset about Brett?  Nah.  Hazard of

the trade.  I don't really have time

for guys anyways.  It's weird, though.

He took it right between the eyes.

Don't often see that.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So you know, Brett just got shot in

the head.

BECKY

(cool as a cucumber)

He did?  Well, huntin's

dangerous...So, anyways, my mom gave

me this 30-aught for my sixteenth

birthday...

MR. LARSON

Amber, I need Stella now!

MR. LARSON (cont'd)

The family's steamin' like a cow pie

in July.  Said she didn't look nothin'

like the picture they gave you.

AMBER

Sorry.  I just thought she might not

wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a

cheap whore.

MR. LARSON

Well, your "cheap whore" is this

family's "lovin' mother."

(pointing at Brett)

The Clemens said to make him look like

he just came from snowmobilin'.  Pink

cheeks, and...

AMBER

(starting to mist up)

-- red nose and ears.  I know, I know.

AMBER

Sorry I couldn't talk today

kcause...I'm scared, okay?

(deep breath)

I open my locker right after first

period and there's a picture of Tammy

Curry taped inside.

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

This was written on back.

TWIN OFFICER #1

Oh-yah, helluva way to go, there.

After some extensive investigation, we

figure the Curry girl musta been

drivin' and smokin' and KABLEWEY!

TWIN OFFICER #2

(holding a Skoal tin)

Not enough left of her to fill a tin.

AMBER

Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her

dad's thresher - she said the heavy

vibration helped her think, y'know?

But I know for a fact she only smoked

after a good drive.  You ask me or

anyone else who isn't scared to talk

about it - Tammy was murdered.

(holding back tears)

God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to

deal with crap like this...

(to crew guy)

Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya?

AMBER (cont'd)

Man, I can't wait for fishin'

season...

MR. LARSON

Amber...

AMBER

No, don't say it.  Another stray

bullet to the head.

AMBER (cont'd)

I'm gonna need more caps.

MR. LARSON

You hafta go home.  There's some kinda

emergency at the trailer park.

AMBER

Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring

home milk and a carton-a Luckys."

MR. LARSON

No.  Loretta called.  There's been

a... a fire.

AMBER

Oh my God - no!  Is my mom okay?  Was

she home?

AMBER (cont'd)

Mom!  Mom!?  MOMMMM!

FIREMAN #1

You family?

LORETTA

No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!"

kcause she's got Tourettes... She's

Annette's kid, dipshit.

AMBER

(to Loretta)

Is Mom okay?

LORETTA

She's alive, sweetie.

AMBER

Where is she?!

LORETTA

She's right over there.

AMBER

Mommmm!  I'll be right behind you in

the hearse!

LORETTA

Don't let that worry you, Annette!

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So, doctor, is this sort of an unusual

injury here?

DOCTOR

Oh you betcha, this was a doozy.

Right now, our chief concern is to

stabilize Annette, then, in surgery,

remove this here.

AMBER

Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.

ANNETTE

Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press-

ons.

(weak)

Well, I sat down for a beer and KA-

BLEWEY!  Next thing I know, somethin'

blows through my kitchen window.  Next

thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's

flower bed.

ROCKER KID #1

(Beavis with a MN accent)

Yah-dude, put another fuckin' book

under it.

ROCKER KID #2 (O.S.)

Don't say "fuckin'." My ma's got the

windows open.

ROCKER KID #2 (cont'd)

kKay-dude, hurry.  We gots like two

fuckin' minutes left on the battery.

ROCKER KID #1

A one...two...one-two-three...

ROCKER KIDS

SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!

ANNETTE

(to Amber)

I shoved your tap shoes in my jeans

before I was blown outta the house,

Honey.  Check with the guy who cut my

pants off.  He should have kem.

AMBER

Mom, uh, about that...I-I'm-oh God...

ANNETTE

Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's

pregnant!

(calling after her)

If you are - come back, sweetie.

Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!

LORETTA

(running after Amber)

Annette, why don't you just see if

there's any beer left in that can and

relax a bit.

LORETTA

You're what?!

AMBER

I-I'm quittin' the pageant.

LORETTA

I heard you, I was just tryin' to

scare you into changin' your mind.  Oh

for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung

to your tap shoes while flyin' through

the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!

AMBER

Oh God, I'm dead...

CANDY STRIPER

Hey, lil' Miss Sad-pants and her

friend Serious Sally, how kbout some

nice cool mints to turn those frowns

upside-down. "S."

LORETTA

(to candy striper)

D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if

I shoved your head up your ass?

AMBER

So, what do I say?

LORETTA

Simple.  Just say, "Mom, I know you

sacrificed everything - relationships,

dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs -

all to bring me into this world.  All

so I could have tap lessons and be in

the pageant - the same one you were

in.  But, y'know what?  I'm quittin'."

There.  Easy as pie.

AMBER

Oh my God.  I'm so dead...

LORETTA

Yeah, you betcha...

ANNETTE

(throwing mints)

Go on!  Get out!

AMBER

Mom, look, don't say anything.  First

of all, I'm not pregnant.

AMBER (cont'd)

Mom!

ANNETTE

I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me

what's up.  I'm reaching' a point

where I'd kill someone for the

nicotine on their fingernails.

AMBER

(deep breath)

Okay.  Yesterday I...I got this

picture.  So I kinda, y'know, I'm

thinkin' no.  I'm gonna, I-I-I'm gonna

quit the pageant.

ANNETTE

What?!

AMBER

Ow!

ANNETTE

(to camera)

Would yous boys excuse us a second?

Loretta, you too.

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I-

I'm not goin' through this again.

ANNETTE

You're not goin' through this again?

You?  You're not the one who knows how

Jiffy Pop feels.

AMBER

Oh, c'mon... First the picture of

Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this?

It's scary.

ANNETTE

Let me tell you "scary," Amber.  Look

at me.  Do you wanna look like you

been rode hard and put away wet at my

age?  I'm a "lifer" here.  Best I can

hope for is to end up in a descent

"raisin ranch" where they'll change me

twice a day.

AMBER

That's it, I'm goin'...

ANNETTE

Honest to God, if I got to do it over?

I'd start walkin' outta this town the

minute I took my first step.

Practically the only thing I wouldn't

do different is have you...

AMBER

God I hope that's you and not your

concussion talkin'.

ANNETTE

(smiling)

It's me...I just don't want this to be

the thing you'd do over.  This

pageant's your ticket outta here.  I

know you can win, Amber.

ANNETTE (cont'd)

C'mere.  I love you so much.

AMBER

I love you much.

LORETTA

Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.

AMBER

No.  Mom said if I did, she'd look up

my dad and marry him.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So has your mom kept your dad's life a

secret?

AMBER

No.  She never hid the fact that my

dad picked his career over us.  What'd

she used to say?

LORETTA

"Once a carnie, always a carnie."

AMBER

Oh-yah.

TWIN OFFICER #1

The Atkins fire?  Foul play?  Shit-no.

After some thorough investigatin', we

determined it musta been a bad wirin'.

Mosta them trailer-folk plug a TV,

VCR, crock pot and Fry-daddy into one

outlet and don't think nothin' of it

ktil KABLEWEY!

TWIN OFFICER #2

(taking a pinch of Skoal)

Not enough left to fill a tin.

ANNETTE

"Bad wirin'?!"  Well, if that ain't

the biggest crock-a-shit ever.

(turning on the candy

striper)

Ooowwww-Jesus!  Did K-Mart have a sale

on dull needles?

CANDY STRIPER

I-I just need one more "do-over."

GLADYS

So, remember the three most important

parts of a good interview...

IRIS

Okay, everybody, listen up!

GLADYS

Number one, American Teen Princess'

don't cross their legs like

streetwalkers.

GLADYS (cont'd)

Excuse me, Miss Penthouse Ninety-

eight, put your knees together.

(contestants laugh)

I could drive a boat show in there.

GLADYS (cont'd)

Ankles together.  Hands resting

lightly on your laps.  Good.  Sit up

straight.  Smile!

JUMP CUT TO:

GLADYS

All right.  Number two: the judges are

as nervous as you are.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So are you about ready to start the

judging - start the interview, there?

JOHN

(after long beat)

Uh, I-I guess I could answer that.

Yep.  We're ready.  So, we should

probably get the young girls in here,

then.  Y'know, to start the

interviews...

HAROLD

(trouble reading)

Uh, "if you could be any tree in the

woods, what kinda tree would you be?"

TESS

(long pause)

Dogwood.

MOLLY

Bonsai.

LESLIE

Green?

MICHELLE

A tree?  I can be any tree you want.

Gimme a minute.

BECKY

One with strong roots in a community

like Mount Rose, a solid Christian

trunk and long leafy branches to

provide shade for handicapped kids on

a hot summer day.

LISA

You guys know the retard's pants are

open?

(laughing)

I don't want to see that.

HAROLD

"Who would you pick to be president,

dead or alive?"

MOLLY

Uh, Emperor Hirohito.

LESLIE

Brett Favre!

BECKY

My mother, kcause she could solve

world hunger with one of her blue-

ribbon rhubarb pies, create world

peace with one of her prayers and

still find time to look

beautiful...for my dad, Lester Leeman.

JOHN

D-do you like to swim?

LISA

Oh-yah, I love to swim.  When I was in

New York, I met Greg Louganis at one-a

my brothers' shows...

JOHN

What the hell is she trying to say?

(yelling)

Say it!

JANELLE

The ktards pants are completely off!

HAROLD

Close up shop.  Close up shop, Hank.

HANK

Harold!

HAROLD

Close up shop!

HAROLD

You Amber Atkins?

AMBER (O.S.)

Yes.  Yes I am.  Thank you, hello.

HAROLD

"Name and spell all the United States

in alphabetical order."

AMBER

Seriously?

HAROLD (O.S.)

Ah-yep.

AMBER

Well, ah...Alabama.  A-L-A-B-A-M-A.

Alaska.  A-L-A-S-K-A.  Arizona.  A-R-I-

Z-O-N-A.

AMBER

West Virginia.  W-E-S-T-V-I-R-G-N-I-A.

Wisconsin.  W-I-S-C-O-N-S-O-N.

Wyoming.  W-Y-O-M-I-N-G.

HAROLD

(looking at others)

Uh-okay, then.

MARY

With two weeks until the pageant...

(continued labored breaths)

I was practicing my talent.  Finishing

my costume, brushing up on current

events, and running eighteen miles a

day on about four hundred calories.  I

was ready.

IRIS

Coupla things...Gladys wants to be

sure we go in show order today.  All

right?  So very important.  Don't

forget that.

CUT TO:

LESLIE

(unusually serious)

Oh-yah, really nervous.  It's been

about two months.  I haven't told my

boyfriend yet.  How did you know?

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

I meant, nervous about the pageant?

LESLIE

(suddenly perky)

Oh!  Nervous about the pageant!  Yah

sure!

CUT TO:

BECKY

There are eight thousand sequins and

fifteen hundred beads on the skirt,

alone.  My mom and Mrs. Lopez make it.

She's one of my father's many Mexican

(Me'hee'kan) workers he lifts from the

poverty they know in Mexico

(Me'heek'koe).

CUT TO:

AMBER

Yah-my ma's clothes all melted onto

mine forming like this big polyester

meteor in our closet, y'know?  But, in

some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor

boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap

costume on the roof-a their trailer

while he was settin' coon traps for

his dad.  Here's the weird part.  It

was still on the hanger.

TESS

And, uh, this is my lucky bolt.  They

think it fell from a DC-10.  The

doctor said I was lucky the flat side

hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone

right through my head.

(holds up red tap dress)

I know, I know, gives me the willies,

too.  I guess the explosion...

JANELLE

(slow, due to signing)

Amber?  Can we switch numbers?  I need

to go first.

(smiling to camera)

My cousin just had a deaf baby and I

get to go see it!

AMBER

Yah-sure, eight's my luck number

anyway.  Diane Sawyer was number eight

at her local.

JANELLE

Thank you.

GLADYS

(loud whisper)

I'll be honest.  This is a hard time

for me.  This is the part of the

pageant when you realize that tomorrow

night, all but one of these girls will

walk out of here a loser.  It's hard

for me to know how that must feel, but

I'm sure it doesn't feel good.

AMBER

Don't you get it?  I was supposed to

go first.  I was contestant number

one.  That light was meant for my

head.  If Janelle hadn't wanted to

change numbers... God, I owe my life

to that deaf baby.

LORETTA

That was your mom.  She wanted you to

have this.

AMBER

(taking drink)

Really, Loretta?

LORETTA

(avoiding eye contact)

You-betcha.

AMBER

My mom wanted me to have this?

LORETTA

Oh, shut up.  I thought it might help

you get some sleep.

AMBER

Loretta, never have kids.

LORETTA

Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still

could.

LORETTA (cont'd)

Here, your ma did want you to have

this since your other one got toasted

and all.

AMBER

Oh...my...God!  It's just like Diane

Sawyer's!  kCourse it's not a size

ten, Diane was a little hippy back

then.  Oh, thank you!  Thank you!

Thank you!

MR. HOWARD

MRS. HOWARD

Go Molly!  Go!  Number one daughter!

PAT

Whooo!  Leslie kicks Teen Princess

ass!  Go Muskies!

GLADYS

Welcome, welcome.  Okay, alright, now.

Is this for me or the gown?

GLADYS (cont'd)

Welcome to the Mount Rose American

Teen Princess Pageant.  While every

contestant you'll meet tonight is

special and unique, they all have one

thing in common.  They're all "Proud -

to - be - an - American!"

CUT TO:

BECKY

I chose Mount Rushmore, because to

live in a country where you can take

an ugly old mountain and put faces on

it, faces of great Americans, who did

so much to make our country super

great, well that makes me - Rebecca

Leeman - PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!

LISA

Living in a country where Lady Liberty

keeps her flame burning bright.

LISA (cont'd)

Keeps her flame burning bright...

LESLIE

The Washington Monument...

LESLIE (cont'd)

(enjoying this)

..makes me, Leslie Miller, proud to be

an American.

AMBER

Living in a country where no matter

who you are or where you come from,

you can grow up and become what you've

always dreamed of, makes me, Amber

Atkins, proud to be an American!

MOLLY

Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard,

proud to be an Asian-American.

TESS

Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's

Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy

Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me

proud I'm American - I kinda

misunderstood the assignment.

IRIS

Okay, okay!  Listen-up.  Coupla notes

from last night's dress rehearsal.

(off clipboard)

Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous

are gettin' sexy with your hips durin'

the "Physical Fitness" routine...

AMBER

Oh my God!  My-my tap costume's gone.

IRIS

Uh, Amber?  We're not puttin' on our

Talent costumes.

You need to put on your "Physical

Fitness" outfit.  And let's shake a

leg, ladies.

AMBER

No, wait.  It-it was here before the

openin' number...wait.  What am I

sayin'?  I should just ask you, Becky.

Where is it?

BECKY

What?

AMBER

You heard me.  Where is it?

BECKY

If you're gettin' at somethin', you

better just say it.

AMBER

I just did.

BECKY

Well then, you better be willin' to

back it up, kcause you're talkin' like

crazy.

AMBER

Oh-oh, you bring me some of that

snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.

BECKY

Well, as my mother says at Sunday

dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!

AMBER

Oh, I'll "get it."  I'll "get it" all

right.  I might even take seconds.

BECKY

If you want seconds, then I'll make

sure it's hot enough for ya.

AMBER

Bitch!

IRIS

(stepping between them)

Girls!  Girls!

BECKY

Give me your stringy-ass hair!

AMBER

I'll get you!

CREW GUY (O.S.)

(barely audible)

Oh God, don't stop kem now...

BECKY

You're choking my, you fucking bitch!

IRIS

(putting hand over camera)

Y'know, I-I don't think yous boys

should, uh, should be in here while

the girls are changin'.

AMBER

I hate her!

IRIS

We all do.  Now let's go.

GLADYS

Yah-so how kbout a big round of

applause for last year's Mount Rose

American Teen Princess, in a farewell

performance.  Who could forget her lip-

synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by

Melissa Manchester.  And here she is,

Mary Johanson!

IRIS

All right, why don't we take up the

stepladders, all right?  For the

Physical Fitness number?

BECKY

(picking up her stool)

They're wet.

LISA

Hey, my hands are stuck.

MOLLY

(sniffing)

Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.

IRIS

Well, hold kem away from you so it

doesn't get on the outfits.

(turning to Servettes)

What kinda mental retard paints step

ladders the morning of a pageant.

HANK

(under throughout)

Here come the judge - pinch, pinch -

here come the judge - pinch, pinch -

here come the judge...

GLADYS

Get back!  Get back, you total retard!

LORETTA

Go Hank!

GLADYS

I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine.

I'm okay...well, our other judges are

Jean Kangas and John Dough...

CHLORIS

(loud whisper)

Opening number looked, uh, good.

Solid.  But now you're gonna have to

actually dance, so...

(holds up jar of Vaseline)

Here.  Put a dab of this on the old

choppers, ladies.  It'll help you

smile.  And when they're lookin' at

your teeth - God willin' - they won't

be lookin at your feet.

BECKY

Hurry up.

LESLIE

Okay, guys, I think we all got some.

You just take it off.

AMBER

Here, I didn't get any.

LESLIE

Here, have some.

MICHELLE

Hand me another white one.

LISA

Listen, you guys, don't go int the

bathroom.  Tess blew chunks all over.

Man, she ate a big dinner.

BECKY

Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky

bolt down her throat for desert.

AMBER

(sotto, to other girls)

And the winner of the "Spirit" award

goes to...

IRIS

(reading from notecard)

"I'd like to take you back seventeen

years, when a peanut farmer was in the

White House, a group-a boys callin'

themselves kQueen' topped the record

charts and Gladys Leeman was Gladys

Wood and she was Mount Rose American

Teen Princess!"

GLADYS

(taking mic)

Thank you, thank you.  You know, I won

the talent contest by sewing these

culottes, Butterick pattern 7-4-3-2.

Can you believe it?  They still fit!

LORETTA

She had a big ass then, she's got a

big ass now.

GLADYS

(pausing for applause)

Thank you, thank you.

Our next eontestant is ready, so let's

welcome her: Tess Weinhaus!

TESS

(in the b.g. throughout)

The beagle is known for it's howl.

"Aaauuuuuhhhh."  The Pekinese has it's

own distinctive bark.  "Yip, yip,

yip."  Not to be confused with the

Chihuahua's, "Yap, yap, yap."  But

none can compare to the greatest bark

of all - the German Shepherd...

AMBER

(to camera, loud whisper)

...Yah-it's just gone...

(eyes welling up)

I mean, I-I just wanna tap, y'know?

I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that

I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least

get a chance to compete?

(starting to sob)

I just wanted my Mom to see me dance.

CHLORIS

(loud whisper)

Amber - Amber, c'mere.

AMBER

Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline

on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for

a year.

CHLORIS

No.  Here.

CHLORIS (cont'd)

It's nothin' special, but talent like

yours doesn't need to hide behind

sequins.

AMBER

Mrs. K--

CHLORIS

You're... you're special and... Ah

hell, go out there and kick some

Leeman ass.

CHLORIS (cont'd)

Not so hard, sweetie.  I heard

somethin' snap...

LESLIE

Roll him over --

(clap, clap, clap)

Lay him flat

(clap, clap, clap)

Pin his shoulders

(clap, clap, clap)

To the mat

(clap, clap, clap)

Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his

shoulders, to the mat!  Yeahhhh!

JUMP CUT TO:

MICHELLE

(without emotion)

Fade in...Earth.  The year is two-

thousand twenty-four.  The question on

everyone's mind:  What is...Soylent

Green?

AMBER

(loud whisper)

Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to

me?  Why're you pretendin' you don't

know what's goin' on?

IRIS

Amber, I'm sorry.  I really am.  But

you know the rules.  All talent

costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys

before the pageant.

AMBER

But, doesn't someone taking your

costume so you can't compete, overrule

that rule?

IRIS

Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules.

AMBER

This, this... This is bullshit!

IRIS

Amber Atkins!  That is not American

Teen Princess language!

AMBER

Good, kcause this isn't an American

Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's

Nazi Germany!

IRIS

(shaking head)

Where do they get this stuff...

AMBER

Mrs. Leeman?

GLADYS

(turning)

Huh?

AMBER

I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh,

I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

GLADYS

Oh really - I don't think so.

(suddenly aware of camera)

Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of

bad news, but rules state that a

costume must be okay'd at least a week

in advance.  And this...

(pointing to costume)

This is why we have the rule.  My

goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a

neckline this low on stage.  We have

kids in the audience.

AMBER

But, you - I mean... It's not my

fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do

anything wrong...

MICHELLE

(climaxing)

That's why... I must say...

(raising arm upward)

Soylent Green... is... people.

GLADYS

Oops, that's my cue.

MOLLY

Wish me luck.

AMBER

(drying her eyes)

Good luck, Molly.

GLADYS

Thank you, Molly.

LISA

(arm around Amber)

Oh, Amber...

AMBER

(can't catch breath)

I-I-I-I-I-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to

compe-e-e-e-ete.

LISA

I can't believe this is happenin'.  I

can't believe she said you couldn't...

LISA (cont'd)

Amber?  Here.

AMBER

(still sobbing)

"Here," wh-wh-what?

LISA

My jacket.  Take it kcause, y'know, I

got my costume okay'd before the

pageant.  You can wear it.

MICHELLE

Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.

LESLIE

(to Lisa)

They're never gonna let you perform

naked.  I asked.

LISA

Shut up, yous guys.  Look, Amber, I'm

not gonna win.  And let's be honest, a

family only needs one "Liza" and you

know Peter's got much better legs than

me.

AMBER

Your parents'd kill you.

LISA

Oh c'mon, I love kem, but you know

they only had me kcause Peter needed a

kidney.

AMBER

Lis, I want to, I really do, but...

Oh, I can't.

LISA

Then do it for Peter.  Mrs. Leeman

used to call him a "skinny little fag"

when he'd bag her groceries.  He'd pop

his Nancy-belt if his old jacket

somehow, I don't know, got her back.

AMBER

Yah?

LISA

Oh-you-beccha.

GLADYS

Now, it's with overwhelming pride that

I introduce contestant number six, who

also happens to be president of her

class - two years running - a member

of the honor roll and the new

President of the Lutheran Sisterhood

Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman!

BECKY

(talking over music)

I don't know how many of you know

this, but I've got a very special

fella in my life - that's right, I

do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to

sing a little song, just for him.

BECKY (cont'd)

You're just too good to be true.

Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd

be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold

you so much.  At long last love has

arrived and I thank God I'm alive.

BECKY (cont'd)

You're just to good to be true.  Can't

take my eyes off of you...

IRIS

C'mon, Lisa.  You're up next.

LISA

I quit.  And, uh, since my costume,

y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm

givin' it to Amber.

GLADYS

Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow!

GLADYS (cont'd)

Voice of an angel, that one.

GLADYS (cont'd)

...Uh, I was just told that contestant

number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite

the pageant.

GLADYS (cont'd)

Well, these things happen.  At any

rate, we still have one more

contestant - number eight, Amber

Atkins.

GLADYS (cont'd)

Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's

finally time to say good-bye to our

judges, so they can go make the

toughest decision of their lives.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So who get's the crown?  How are you

going to figure this all out?

JOHN

Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare

scores and uh, figure out a-a winner.

kCause we don't know the winner yet...

I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and

Harold picked.  No idea.  Did Gladys

send you in here?

HANK

I know the winner!  I know the winner!

I know the winner!

JOHN

No you don't!  Shut your goddamn

mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!!

HAROLD

Wait a second.

JOHN

You shut it!  You goddamn retard!

HANK

EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!

HAROLD

Come on!  Hankey here can't help it if

he was born crazier than a shithouse

rat!

JOHN

For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave

him with a sitter?

HAROLD

Real nice.  You know the sitter's

dead.

DISSOLVE TO:

LESLIE

So, anyone talk to Janelle?

AMBER

Yah-I brought her some flowers this

morning.  She's in the room next to my

mom.  She's super happy.

TESS

She's happy?

LESLIE

Why happy?

AMBER (cont'd)

Oh -- the blow to her head made her

deaf...

BECKY

(losing it)

Oh, good Lord!  What're they doin'?

Lettin' the retard count votes?!

IRIS

It's time, ladies.

GLADYS (cont'd)

And the First Runner-up is -

drops)

Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins.

GLADYS (cont'd)

And finally, the moment I know I've

been waiting for...

GLADYS (cont'd)

With a scholarship of five-hundred

dollars, courtesy Leeman Furniture,

and all expenses paid for next weekend

when she'll be competin' for the title

of Minnesota American Teen Princess...

GLADYS (cont'd)

Our new Mount Rose American Teen

Princess is contestant number - ah

heck, she's my daughter - number

seven, Rebecca Ann Leeman!

BECKY

Oh, thank you so much!

ANNETTE

Shit.

ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR

(tune of "Miss America")

"Here she is, Our Mount Rose American

Teen Princess.  Look at her, doesn't

she look fine.  Our hearts swell big,

as we look at her.  Our Mount Rose

American Teen Princess."

ANNETTE

We was robbed.

LORETTA

Okay.  Take her purse.

AMBER

Bye mom.

ANNETTE

We was robbed.

AMBER

It's okay.

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

Oh, Mom's okay.  They're just givin'

her a ride back.  She almost blew

outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on

the way over.

LORETTA

Thank God for bunge cords.

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

(tearing up)

...Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got

to perform.  And Mom got to see me.

(crying)

I guess number eight only worked for

Diane Sawyer...

LESLIE

Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up!  Whooo!

I got second place!

PAT

Third.

LESLIE

Huh?

LISA

No, it was worth it.  Amber shoulda

won.

LISA'S FATHER

I'll tell ya one thing.  Peter never

woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.

LISA

Well, y'know what, dad?  Y'know what?

Peter's gay!

LISA'S FATHER

What?!

DISSOLVE TO:

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

So, how does it feel to be the new

Mount Rose American Teen Princess,

Becky?

BECKY

Well, it's all happenin' so fast.

Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems

real, y'know?  I mean, I won!  I'm the

winner!  I'm going to State!

GLADYS

She's the winner and we're going to

state.

FRY GIRL #1

What a surprise.  Gladys Leeman's

finally gonna go to State.

And she'll probably ride on Becky's

ass all the way to Nationals, too.

PREGNANT FRY GIRL

I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Are you ladies going to the parade

tomorrow?

PREGNANT FRY GIRL

Nah.  I think I'm like, due or

somethin'.

LESTER

Ahhh.  Beautiful as a whore's ass

today.  Eh, boys?

GLADYS

(into bullhorn)

Hey!  Turn that float around.  You

think a swan's gonna swim ass first up

Main Street?

LESTER

Yah-Gladys had me order that swan

special made from Mexico (Me'hee'koe)

in case Becky won.  I do a lotta

business with those people.  I always

offer to pay kem in tacos.

(laughing)

Whoo, they love that.

MAYOR

(into bullhorn)

Yah-hello-hello...shit!  How the fuck

do ya work this damn thing, huh?  Oh.

Welcome to our first ever American

Teen Princess Parade - which also

happens to be the unveiling of our new

sewer system!

MAYOR (cont'd)

Yah-so, while Becky gets on her float,

then, any questions kbout the new

sewer?  Yah, Clem?

JUMP CUT TO:

HAROLD

Let's get this straight right now.  We

wouldn't have been late at all if it

wasn't for you.

HANK

I want to have the big bag of little

donuts.

HAROLD

You get nothing, Hank, okay?

HANK

I want to get the big bag of little

donuts.

HAROLD

There's your paint can.  The next time

you drink window cleaner, I'm just

gonna leave it in ya.

JUMP CUT TO:

GLADYS

C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.  Now

get up there.  Ride it side-saddle if

you have to - like a horse.  C'mon,

now.

BECKY

It smells funny.  Like gasoline.

GLADYS

Oh for chrissakes, everything smells

like that in Mexico.

BECKY

My dress'll reek.

GLADYS

Listen, little missy, this cost your

dad a pretty penny.  Now get your ass

up there and show me some teeth.

LESLIE

Amber, if I die from these fumes, will

you be sure to cover the hickies on my

neck?

AMBER

Yeah...

LESLIE

And the bite marks on my ears?

AMBER

(slowly turning)

Yes...

LESLIE

I know it doesn't matter, but on my

inner thighs.

AMBER

Yes, Leslie!

HANK

Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!

Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!

GLADYS

Okay, I designed the float, you know.

And, what's gonna happen here is that

this is going to look like a

glistening lake beneath the swan.

IRIS

Uh, Gladys?

GLADYS

What!

IRIS

We need more bars!

GLADYS

This is -- what?

IRIS

Enid ate a whole pan!

GLADYS

I swear to God she can't do anything

by herself.

AMBER

(to camera)

Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured

it.  Chokin' on swan gas.

GLADYS

Oh my God!  My Baby!  The swan ate my

baby!

(grabbing at burning float)

Ow-ow-ow!  Get up, Rebecca!  Get outta

there!  We've gotta go to State!  Oh

hot!

(she scorches her blouse)

Oh, damn.  I like this blouse.

Rebecca!  Get up, angel face.  Time to

go to State!  Ow-ow-ow!

GLADYS (cont'd)

Get offa me, you cow!

GLADYS (cont'd)

What're you lookin' at?  Huh?  A whole

God Damn town of losers!  That's what

I'm lookin' at!

GLADYS (cont'd)

You!  You piece-a-shit trailer trash!

This shoulda been you!  Damn, I

shoulda killed you when I had the

GLADYS (cont'd)

Hey, Ted, sorry.  I didn't know your

family was in the garage when I set it

on fire!

LESTER

Gladys!  Stop it!

GLADYS

Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much

as it was a bake sale.  Ah-

hahahahahahahaha!

GLADYS (cont'd)

Let go-a-me, you old bastard!

GLADYS (cont'd)

At least you've got another daughter.

LESTER

So help me, Gladys.

GLADYS

Becky was my only shot at state!

LESTER

That's enough!

GLADYS

Let go!  Let go of me.  Oh my God,

it's COPS!

GLADYS (cont'd)

(pointing to Lester)

He sells reproductions!  His

furniture's as fake as my orgasms!

SCOTT

Hey, man, how're you doin'?

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Hi!  What's up, Scott?  You remember

Bruce, right?

SCOTT

Long time, no see.

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)

Bruce, that's Roy.

(they shake hands)

Roy, Bruce.

PASTOR

That's why, dear Lord, it's with such

great sorrow that we turn over to you

a young woman whose dream of ridin' on

a giant swan brought about her

untimely death.  Maybe it's your way

of telling us to buy American.

IRIS

As, uh, actin' President of the Mount

Rose Civil Servettes, it's my duty

since Becky can't fulfill her duties -

kcause she's dead-n-all - to make you

Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

MALE REPORTER #1

Turn around and let me see.

LORETTA

What is wrong with you?

AMBER

I don't know.  I just didn't wanna win

like this.

LORETTA

You stop right there.  You are a good

person.  Good things happen to good

people.

AMBER

Really?

LORETTA

No.  It's pure bullshit, sweetie.

You're lucky as hell, so you might as

well enjoy it.  Let's get you a root

beer float.

AMBER

Okay.

LORETTA

Do you guys want some shots?  I'm

buyin'.

AMBER (V.O.)

I never liked her, but she didn't

deserve to die in the belly of a swan

like that.  The whole thing's just

kinda sad and lame at the same time.

LORETTA

(handing over packet)

This came for you, sweetie.

AMBER

Ah!  It's from State!  Oh my God!

AMBER (cont'd)

(paging through packet)

It's all the stuff I get to do.  Oh my

God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get

a "personal consultation" with a make-

up artist -- Eeeh!  Okay, um, there'll

be a choreographer to the stars and,

oh no -- No way.  Oh... My... God!

LORETTA

What?  For chrissakes, spit it out.

AMBER

I'll be stayin' overnight at... The

Airport Howard Johnsons!

LORETTA

Right by the airport - Oh, Amber...

AMBER

There's an indoor swimming pool!

Ahhhh!

AMBER (cont'd)

Oh crap - I only got four days.  I

gotta practice!

DIP TO BLACK:

LORETTA

All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."

AMBER

Airport Ho-Jo!

LORETTA

I got it!  Yeah, why don't ya take a

AMBER

Loretta, don't do that.

LORETTA

I'm sorry.  They're just starin'.

AMBER

I gotta work with these women.

LORETTA

Okay, sweetie, that's all right.

Let's go.  Let's go.

TERRY

And you are...

AMBER

Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

TERRY

Funny, you don't look dead.

COLLEEN

Okay ladies, listen up.  I'm Colleen

Douglas and this raving beauty on my

right --

TERRY

I'm a mirror.

COLLEEN

Correction.  This spunky monkey on my

right is Terry Macey.  And we are your

Minnesota American Teen Princess State

Board.

TERRY

We're also the co-founders of the

Minnesota Modeling Academy.

Applications are at the tiki bar.

We'll wave the fifty dollar

application fee if you list a friend

and put her address.

COLLEEN

That's right.

TERRY

Okay?

COLLEEN

Mm-hm.

LORETTA

So...you're cute.  Oh, I see you're

married.

(to bartender)

You catch this in your mouth, I'll

give you a present.  All right?  Open

wide...

(she throws the olive)

Oh, God, you got that on the first

try.  Come here.

LORETTA (cont'd)

You are cute.

TERRY

Due to budgetary cutbacks - and the

fact that Nationals didn't cough up a

damn nickel this year - you won't be

stayin' overnight.  So pay attention,

you've got about eight hours until

showtime.

MR. MELCHOIR

Remember to count, ladies.  Cross on

the left and arms up on eight!  On the

beat!  On the beat!  Keep on it!  Keep

movin' it!  C'mon, Miss Forest Lake,

take that stick out of your ass or I

will.  All right.  Very nice.  Now

come on, arms out.  We're in the front

row.  Come on, sell it!  That's very

nice.  Remember, figure eights,

ladies...

COLLEEN

(tipsy, holding up glass)

I can sum up our entire philosophy

with this glass.  I look at it and

say, "it's half full."  Which, in the

beauty pageant biz means, "Where the

hell's my waiter!"

COLLEEN (cont'd)

(screaming)

Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo

before I rip your fat little heads

off!

MR. MELCHOIR

Miss Burnsville, you're up next...

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

Don't tell anyone, but, I have a

little secret weapon of my own.

AMBER

I don't eat shellfish.  Mom always

says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can

carry its house around with it - who

knows the last time it's been

cleaned."  She should know.

JUMP CUT TO:

MISS MINNEAPOLIS

... I've done about thirty-five

pageants.  I guess my most memorable

one'd have to be Miss Teen America,

1995.  It was in Vegas.  My roommate

did Adam West.

MISS MINNEAPOLIS (cont'd)

She said he was sooo horny.

JUMP CUT TO:

AMBER

(whispering to camera)

Oh my God.  Look at her, she's

awesome.  I should just go home now.

TERRY

Okay, okay, that's enough - I get it.

MISS MINNEAPOLIS

Oh - oh my God...

(doubling over in pain)

I gotta go!

COLLEEN

(calling after her)

Well, you're gonna have to do

somethin' with those nerves before

Nationals.  Thirty-million people

aren't gonna wait while you run to the

john.

FEMALE REPORTER

(hand on earpiece)

Today, a beauty pageant turned ugly.

A salmonella dysentery outbreak, now

traced to improperly refrigerated

shellfish, was believed to be the

cause.  Joining us now is David

Richardson, a member of the

documentary crew filming the pageant.

He was there when tragedy struck.

CREW GUY

Fuckin' beauty queens blowin' chunks

everywhere.  I've never seen anything

like it before, and I live in L.A.

Hey, Ed.

FEMALE REPORTER #2

Can you tell us any thing about the

controversy?  Is there a controversy

here?  Has there been sabotage?

COLLEEN

(with forced sobriety)

People, people - wait, wait a minute,

here.  Uh, while we haven't ruled out

sabotage from neighboring state

pageants - Iowa, Wisconsin, North

Dakota...

TERRY

Yeah.

COLLEEN

Dakota.

TERRY

Ohio...

That bitch from...

What?

AMBER

Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph I hope Gladys

Leeman hangs herself in her cell when

she hears this.

GLADYS

Uh-huh.  No, no.  Gosh, no.  You know

I still don't want to be on camera...

GLADYS (V.O. ON THE PHONE)

Yah - I just wanna say - that little

bitch better watch her back at

Nationals kcause I'm makin' friends on

the inside... Yah-friends who have

friends on the outside...

FEMALE PRISONER

Sawyer.

LORETTA

Okay, ready?  Here's the signal I'm
