SHERIFF WYNER

Sheriff Wyner...

VOICE (O.S.)

Worms.

SHERIFF WYNER

Afternoon, Miz Munson.

MRS. MUNSON

Afternoon, Sheriff. You know the

Funthes boy?

SHERIFF WYNER

...Mackatee Funthes?

MRS. MUNSON

No no, WeeMack! Mackatee's eldest!

SHERIFF WYNER

Oh yeah, believe I do.

MRS. MUNSON

Well, he's a good boy but he done

gone down to the Costco in Pascagoula

and got hisself a blastah -- and he

been playin' that music!

SHERIFF WYNER

Uh-huh...

MRS. MUNSON

Loud!

SHERIFF WYNER

Well--

MRS. MUNSON

"Left my wallet in El Segundo!"

SHERIFF WYNER

He--

MRS. MUNSON

Songs like that!

SHERIFF WYNER

Uh-huh...

MRS. MUNSON

Hippity-hop music!

SHERIFF WYNER

I could--

MRS. MUNSON

You know they call it hippity-hop

music, but it don't make me wanna go

hippity-hop!

SHERIFF WYNER

No ma'am--

MRS. MUNSON

And Othar don't like that music

neither!

SHERIFF WYNER

It's been disturbin' Othar then, has

it?

MRS. MUNSON

How could it help but do! That kind

of music! You know what they call

colored folks in them songs? Have

you got any idea?

SHERIFF WYNER

I don't think I--

MRS. MUNSON

NIGGAZ! I don't wanna say the word.

I won't say it twice, I'll tell you

that. I say it one time.

SHERIFF WYNER

Yes ma'am.

MRS. MUNSON

In the course a swearin' out my

complaint.

SHERIFF WYNER

Yes'm--

MRS. MUNSON

NIGGAZ! Two thousand years after

Jesus! Thirty years after Martin

Luther King! The age of Montel! Sweet

lord a-mercy, izzat where we at?

SHERIFF WYNER

Mm-mm--

MRS. MUNSON

WeeMack down to Pascagoula buyin' a

big thumpy stereo player?! So he can

listen to that word in the house

next to mine? Sheriff, you gotta

help that boy!

SHERIFF WYNER

Help him?

MRS. MUNSON

You gotta take an innarest! EXTEND

that helpin' hand!

SHERIFF WYNER

(dubious)

Well, we're here to help...

MRS. MUNSON

Well God bless ya. Don't wanna be

tried and found wantin'.

SHERIFF WYNER

No ma'am.

MRS. MUNSON

Many many tunkalow parzen, Sheriff

Wyner. Many many tunkalow parzen!

SHERIFF WYNER

Many what ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

You have been tried and found wanting.

Don't want that writin' on the wall!

SHERIFF WYNER

No ma'am--

MRS. MUNSON

Feast a Balthazar!

SHERIFF WYNER

Mm-hm.

MRS. MUNSON

John The Apostle said: Behold there

is a stranger in our midst, come to

destroy us!

SHERIFF WYNER

Yes ma'am.

MRS. MUNSON

He's a good man. Just needs

instruction. Dog, you in peoples'

way.

MRS. MUNSON

You need somethin' to eat, Angel?

MRS. MUNSON

Mm... gizzards...

MRS. MUNSON

Othar, I went'n complained about

WeeMack, I hope it'll do some good.

That boy hangin' by a thread! Over

the pit! Fiery pit! "I Left My Wallet

in El Segundo"!

MRS. MUNSON

...Sixty-seven years of life, forty-

six years of marriage, you mean to

tell me you never one time suffered

from piles? It's the human condition,

most humans anyway. Like that ball

player said: world's got two kinds

of folks -- them that's got piles

and them that's gonna get 'em. But

you was always healthy as an ox...

MRS. MUNSON

...Passed on before you got piles.

Mmmmhmm. Thank the Lord you wasn't

sick. You don't wanna sicken 'n die.

No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful...

go to sleep one night, wake up in

the glory land... woof...

MRS. MUNSON

...Well who's that now, Pickles?

MRS. MUNSON

PICKLES!

DORR

Ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

Go get 'im!

DORR

I do beg your pardon?

MRS. MUNSON

Go get Pickles, I didn't let 'im

out!

DORR

(tasting the name)

Pickles...

MRS. MUNSON

Oh, he's up the tree again. Your

gonna have to shimmy on up.

DORR

I am so terribly sorry, madam. But

won't the feline eventually tire of

his lonely perch and, pining for his

master's affection, return on his

own initiative?

MRS. MUNSON

Huh? No, he won't come down less you

fetch him. He'd set there til Gabriel

blows his horn if someone didn't

shimmy up. Up with you now!

DORR

Well then couldn't we perhaps offer

him kitty treats and enticements, or

if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky

little toys of the kind formerly

manufactured in Hong Kong but now

produced in the other so-called

"Little Tigers"...

DORR

...of the Pacific Rim? The point

bein', do we have to actually ascend

the tree--

MRS. MUNSON

Look, I don't want no doubletalk. If

you ain't gonna fetch him down I

guess I gotta call the po-lice...

DORR

Police...

MRS. MUNSON

They ain't gonna be happy. Every

time they come fetch him down they

swear they won't do it no more...

DORR

No need to call the authorities. I

did this often as a youth -- why, I

was a positive lemur... Here, kitty...

MRS. MUNSON

Don't upset him, now!

DORR

I wouldn't dream of it... harmless

little felix domesticus... Come to

G.H...

DORR

I thank you, madam, for your act of

kindness.

MRS. MUNSON

Well you let him out.

DORR

I certainly did and I do apologize

no end. Allow me to present myself,

uh, formally: Goldthwait Higginson

Dorr, Ph.D.

MRS. MUNSON

What, like Elmer?

DORR

Beg your pardon, ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

Fudd?

DORR

No no, Ph.D. is a mark of academic

attainment. It is a degree of higher

learning bestowed, in my case, in

recognition of my mastery of the

antique languages of Latin and Greek.

I also hold a number of other advanced

degrees including the baccalaureate

from a school in Paris, France, called

the Sorbonne.

MRS. MUNSON

Sore bone, well I guess that's

appropriate. You ever study at Bob

Jones University?

DORR

I have not had that privilege.

MRS. MUNSON

It's a bible school, only the finest

in the country. I send them five

dollars every month.

DORR

That's very gener--

MRS. MUNSON

I'm on their mailing list. I'm an

Angel.

DORR

Indeed.

MRS. MUNSON

They list my name in the newsletter,

every issue. I got the literature

here, you wanna examine it.

DORR

Perhaps when my head has recovered

from its... buffeting. Mrs. Munson,

are you at all curious as to why I

darkened your door, as the expression

has it, on this lovely camelia-scented

morn?

MRS. MUNSON

I was wondering, til you let Pickles

out. Then in all the excitement--

DORR

I quite understand. The fact is that

I saw the sign on your window

advertising a room to let, and it is

the only such sign among the houses

of this charming, charming street.

MRS. MUNSON

Yeah, I got a room. I'm lookin' for

a quiet tenant. Fifteen dollars a

week

DORR

I quite understand. Madam, you are

addressing a man who is quiet -- and

yet not quiet, if I may offer a

riddle...

DORR

...Perhaps you can show me the room,

Mrs. Munson, and allow me to explain.

MRS. MUNSON

Well you can see the room, but I

don't like double-talk.

DORR

You see, madam, I am currently on

sabbatical from the institution where

I teach -- the University of

Mississippi at Hattiesburg. I am

taking a year off to indulge my

passion -- I don't believe that is

too strong a word -- for the music

of the Renaissance. I perform in --

and have the honor of directing -- a

period instrument ensemble that

performs at Renaissance fairs and

other cultural fora...

DORR

...thoo-out central and southern

Mississippi. We perform on the

instruments for which the music was

originally composed, in the belief

that... that... Why, this is lovely...

MRS. MUNSON

Wait a minute. You got some kind of

band?

DORR

The word "band" would be, in this

context, something of an anachronism.

Though we do play together -- hence

the word "ensemble" -- the nature of

the music is such that one would

hesitate to apply the epithet "band"

with its connotations of jangling

rhythm and ear-popping amplification.

MRS. MUNSON

So you don't play hippity-hop, "I

Left My Wallet in El Segundo," songs

with the titles spelt all funny?

DORR

Madam, I shudder. I quake. The

revulsion I feel for modern popular

music, and all other manifestations

of contemporary decay, is, I have no

doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we

play music that was composed to the

greater glory of God. Devotional

music. Church music.

MRS. MUNSON

Gospel music?

DORR

Well-inspired by the gospels,

certainly. The vintage, of course,

is no more recent than the Rococo.

MRS. MUNSON

Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be

okay.

DORR

But I certainly don't propose to

inflict our rehearsals on you. May I

enquire -- do you have a root cellar?

DORR

Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...

MRS. MUNSON

Little dank, ain't it?

DORR

Oh, indeed, but that only improves

the acoustics...

DORR

...Marvelous. These earthen walls

are ideal for baffling the higher

registers of the, uh, lute and, uh,

sackbutt. That's why so much music

of the cinquecento was played in

crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will

do nicely...

DORR

...This is perfect. This is more

than perfect. I can scarcely contain

my glee.

MRS. MUNSON

You containing it okay.

DORR

Allow me to pay you a week in advance.

Allow me to pay you two weeks in

advance. Allow me to pay you a month

in advance. I cannot countenance the

thought of these charming apartments

being tenanted by someone

unappreciative of their special je

ne sais quoi.

MRS. MUNSON

That would be a shame.

VOICE (V.O.)

You gotta peel this shit out sticks

to the bottom.

WEEMACK

...You wouldn't believe this shit,

sometimes even out here on the casino

floor you gonna find sanitary napkin

shit stuck there, Tucks, I don't

know what the fuck people do while

they're gambling here man.

GAWAIN

I ain't peelin' funky shit with my

human hands, man. That's a

prescription for disease and viruses

and shit, attackin' y'insides.

WEEMACK

You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks

everything. Man is a motherfuck.

Shit -- looka this.

WEEMACK

...You keep an eye out, man. I found

a hundred-dollar chip once.

GAWAIN

Fuck that, man. I ain't pawin' through

used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip.

WEEMACK

I said it was a hundred.

GAWAIN

Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n

leak outcha fuckin' asshole.

WEEMACK

This tunnel leads back onto land. To

the office for all the people work

for Mannex. Mannex Corporation. Owns

the Lady Luck 'n three other boats...

WEEMACK

...This is where they think on their

corporate shit, Gudge and them.

WEEMACK

...The lights is ugly but it ain't

as many Tucks.

WEEMACK

...YO, motherfuck! Lemme in!

MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)

What's the password?

WEEMACK

Kiss my ass.

WEEMACK

This is where they count the dough.

You try to take any of it Elron there

shoot your ass.

WEEMACK

...This place is a fuckin' pigsty.

You a pig, man, nothin' but a squeaky

ol' motherfuckin' pig...

WEEMACK

...You got fuckin' Kocoa Krispies in

ya uniform man, still got breakfast

there and you eatin' motherfuckin'

lunch.

WEEMACK

...You a disgrace before motherfuckin'

God...

WEEMACK

...You a motherfuck-- oh, hello Mr.

Gudge, how we be this mornin'?

GUDGE

Funthes. How's the new man?

WEEMACK

He is a cleaning motherfucker, man!

GUDGE

Is that a fact.

PANCAKE (O.S.)

One, Mountain!

PANCAKE

...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four,

Mountain!

DIRECTOR (O.S.)

Cut, goddamnit. His canteen fell

off.

CUT UP TO:

DIRECTOR

...Props!

DIRECTOR

...The goddamn thing's canteen fell

off. It would have been a good take.

PANCAKE

Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that...

PANCAKE

... Mountain, bring Otto with the

apparatus.

DIRECTOR

What the hell is this?

PANCAKE

World War I vintage gas mask. It's

authentic. Strapped on, of course,

so it can't fall off. The animal is

free to be as active as he wants,

doesn't inhibit his movement, and I

think it really sells the whole

doughboy thing--

DIRECTOR

It looks like a fucking joke.

PANCAKE

...Nnnnrnff!

DIRECTOR

What?

PANCAKE

No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely

right, the gas mask is a whimsical

concept--

DIRECTOR

How the hell does it eat when it

gets to the Kennel Rations?

PANCAKE

Well, you're absolutely right-

DIRECTOR

Don't let the client see this.

PANCAKE

Of course not, that would be

inappropriate--

DIRECTOR

Or the Humane fucker.

PANCAKE

No no--

DIRECTOR

They'll shut the fucking spot down,

Pancake. Put the goddamn canteen

back on. That says he's a soldier.

Dented tin canteen. Just tie the

damn thing to his collar.

PANCAKE

Easiest thing in the world. I just

thought -- but the canteen is much

better. Good concept. Let's go with

that--

DIRECTOR

What's he doing?

PANCAKE

Well, he's uh... Just breathe

normally, Otto.

DIRECTOR

The fucking dog can't breathe.

PANCAKE

Oh, he can breathe, that thing is --

just breathe normally, Otto.

DIRECTOR

The fucking dog cannot breathe! Get

that fucking thing off him!

PANCAKE

Of course. Easiest thing in the world.

PANCAKE

...It's on good and tight, I, uh...

Just breathe normally, Otto.

DIRECTOR

Get the fucking thing off him!

PANCAKE

Don't have my Leatherman. Mountain!

Give me your Leatherman! Chop chop!

DIRECTOR

Get the fucking thing off him! Chitra,

make sure the Humane fucker doesn't

come over here! Bring him to craft

services!

PANCAKE

Good idea! Ice water, treats-

DIRECTOR

Not the dog, you idiot! The Humane

fucker! Distract him!

PANCAKE

Right! Of course!

DIRECTOR

Oh my god, he's bleeding!

PANCAKE

No, that's me -- I -- the

Leatherman... here we go.

DIRECTOR

Put up a couple solids here -- I

don't want the client seeing this!

PANCAKE

Come on, Otto!

DIRECTOR

Otto is fucking dead!

PANCAKE

Mountain, have electric run me a

stinger! Don't give up on me, Otto!

Mountain, I need two live leads!

MOUNTAIN GIRL

Clark, the gennie's a hundred yards

away!

PANCAKE

Goddamnit! Otto's gonna have brain

damage in about ninety seconds! Okay!

PANCAKE

...Kiss of life!

QUARTERBACK

Delta thirty-seven. On four!

TEAM

Huh!

QUARTERBACK

Okay, Epsilon twenty-two! You the

man!... Hey! BUTTHEAD!

QUARTERBACK

You the man!

HUDSON (O.S.)

Me the man?

TEAM

Huh!

HUDSON (O.S.)

Unh... oh no...

HUDSON (O.S.)

...shit...

MATCH CUT TO:

COACH (O.S.)

Hudson!

YOUTH #1

All right Dragon Lady, give us all

YOUTH #1

We want that donut money!

VIETNAMESE WOMAN

Yao gin nyap!

YOUTH #2

Okay papa-san, we want that donut

money.

YOUTH #1

VIETNAMESE WOMAN

Hi-Ho.

YOUTH #2

Look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't

complicated. You give us all the

YOUTH #1

Give us the money!

YOUTH #1

YOUTH #1

His fingers are way the fuck up my

nose.

YOUTH #2

GET... YA FINGAS... OUT... THE

MAN'S... NOSE!

YOUTH #1

I think they're in my brain, man...

YOUTH #2

MOTHERFUCK!

PREACHER

I know you all remember that when

Moses came down the mountain, carrying

the word a God, come down that Sinai

peak, he caught those Israelites red-

handed. What he catch 'em doin'? He

caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.

PREACHER

...He caught 'em with their backs

turned on God!

PREACHER

...He caught 'em worshipping a FALSE

God! A God of EARTHLY things! He

caught them Israelites in DECLINE!

PREACHER

...Because backslidin' is DECLINE,

brothers and sisters! You hear talk

these days, and I know you've heard

this talk, you hear talk of DECLINE,

well all that means is we done turned

our back on God!

PREACHER

...People say civilization doin'

this, civilization doin' that,

civilization in DECLINE! Well it

ain't no civilization! It ain't no

them! It's US, brothers and sisters!

PREACHER

...It's what's in our hearts, each

and every one of us when we like

them Israelites! Slidin' awa-a-a-ay

down that Godly slope, slippin' and

slidin' toward the mire and muck a

the stinkhole of greed -- that's

DECLINE!

PREACHER

...And what did Moses do when he saw

those declinin' backslidin' never-

mindin' sinners?

PREACHER

...Moses SMOTE those sinners in his

wrath yes he did!

PREACHER

...Y'all know what smote is! I smite!

You smite! He smites! We done smote!

PREACHER

...To smite is to go UPSIDE the head!

PREACHER

...Because sometimes, brothers and

sisters, that is the ONLY way!

PREACHER

...To smite is to reMIND! We got to

STOP that decline! And scramble back

UP to the face a the almighty Gyod!

PREACHER

...'Stead a worshippin' that GOLDEN

calf, that earthly TRASH on that

GARBAGE island! That GARBAGE island

in that shadowland WAY outside the

Kingdom a God!

PREACHER

...That GARBAGE island where scavenger

birds feast on the bones a the

backslidin' damned!

PREACHER

...And so, let us pray...

WOMAN #1

You preach a wonderful sermon, Brother

Cleothus.

PREACHER

Why thank you, Sister Rose.

MRS. MUNSON

That man has a lot to say.

WOMAN #1

Yes he does.

MRS. MUNSON

And every word of it the truth.

WOMAN #2

Mm-mm. Jesus well pleased with him.

WOMAN #3

Deed he is.

PREACHER

Oh now ladies...

WOMAN #3

Pleased as he can be.

WOMAN #1

Mm-mm.

MRS. MUNSON

Stout, too.

WOMAN #1

Mm-mm.

PREACHER

Oh now you gracious ladies.

MRS. MUNSON

It was a good sermon. That man has a

lot to say.

MRS. MUNSON'S VOICE (O.S.)

...Stout, too. It would've been a

comfort to you...

MRS. MUNSON

And the choir was all in good voice.

Mm-mm-

MRS. MUNSON

...Who could that--

DORR

My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope

this is not an inopportune time for

our first practice--

MRS. MUNSON

Somebody die?

DORR

I beg your-- Oh!

DORR

...No no, no bereavement, though it

is so kind of you to enquire. No,

the hearse is simply a vehicle

commodious enough to accommodate all

of the members of our ensemble. And

of course our instruments, contrived

in an age ignorant of

miniaturization...

DORR

...Let me introduce you to my friends,

my colleagues, these devoted and

passionate musicians... This is Gawain

MacSam, our bassoonist...

DORR

...General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da

gamba...

MRS. MUNSON

No smoking in this house.

GENERAL

So sorry.

DORR

...Clark Pancake -- a multi-

instrumentalist, but with his

remarkable embosser Clark specializes

in wind instruments, and is especially

accomplished on the French horn...

DORR

...And, finally, Aloysius "Lump"

Hudson. Lump is our sackbuttist and --

thank you, Lump -- I see you've also

brought my fiddle...

LUMP

Here's your fiddle, Doctor.

MRS. MUNSON

You ain't gonna make a racket, are

ya?

DORR

Oh no. Oh no no no no no. No, we

shall recuse ourselves to the basement

where we shall be -- I think here

the expression is uniquely

appropriate...

DORR

...as quiet as the crypt.

MRS. MUNSON

Hmph.

DORR

What do you think, General? Present

any problems?

DORR

...Good then.

DORR

...All right, gentlemen, why don't

we all crowd around and go over the

plan.

DORR

...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck,

gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the

Mississippi delta -- and the focus

of our little exercise. Here is

Orchard Street...

DORR

...and here is the residence of Marva

Munson, the charming lady whom y'all

met moments ago. Gentlemen...

DORR

...You... are... here. Now. This

brings us to this square...

DORR

...Gentlemen, I believe you are all

aware that the Solons of the State

of Mississippi, to wit, its

legislature, have decreed that no

gaming establishment shall be erected

within its borders upon dry land.

They may, however, legally float

upon any watercourse defining a state

boundary. But while the gambling

activity itself is restricted to

riverboats, no such restriction

applies to the functions ancillary

to this cash besotted bidnis. The

casino's offices, locker rooms,

facilities to cook and clean, and

most importantly its counting houses-

the reinforced, secret, and super

secure repositories of the lucre --

may all be situated... wherever.

Gawain -- where is wherever?

GAWAIN

Say wha?

DORR

Where is the money?

GAWAIN

Oh. End of every shift pit boss brings

the cash down to the hold of the

ship in the locked cash box; once a

day all the cash boxes're moved to

the counting room.

DORR

And where is the counting room?

GAWAIN

Well, uh... in that square there.

Where you pointing.

DORR

And what, to flog a horse that if

not at this point dead is in mortal

danger of expirin', does the dotted

square represent?

GAWAIN

...Offices. Underground.

DORR

Underground... Mmm... During the

casino's hours of operation the door

to the counting room is fiercely

guarded, and the door itself is of

redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when

the casino is closed the entire

underground complex is locked up and

the armed guard retreats to the

casino's main entrance. There, then,

far from the guard, reposes the money,

cosseted behind a five-inch-thick

steel portal, yes, but the walls,

gentlemen, the walls of that room,

are but humble masonry, behind which

is only the soft loamy soil deposited

over the centuries by Ol' Man, the

meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned

its way back and forth across this

great alluvial plain...

DORR

...This earth.

DORR

...Any questions?

DORR

...Yes, Lump?

LUMP

What, uh... what does "cosseted"

mean?

DORR

The General here, whose curriculum

vitae compahends massive tunneling

experience thoo the soil of his native

French-Indochina, will direct our

little ol' tunnelin' operation.

DORR

...Clark Pancake, while a master of

none, is a jack of all those trades

corollary to our aim. He will be

doin' such fabricatin' and demolition

work as our little caper shall

require.

PANCAKE

Happy to be on board.

DORR

Gawain is the proverbial "inside

man". He has managed to secure a

berth on the custodial staff of the

Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself

in a position to perform certain

chores whose precise nature needn't

detain us here, but whose performance

shall guide this expedition to its

happy conclusion.

GAWAIN

Ya damn skippy.

DORR

And this brings us to Lump. To look

at Lump you might wonder, what

function could he possibly fill,

what specialized expertise could he

possibly offer, to our merry little

ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen,

in a project of such magnitude and

such risks, it is traditional --

nay, it is imperative -- to enlist

the services of a hooligan, a goon,

an ape, a physical brute, who will

be our security, our fist, our

batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt

instrument, and on all our behalfs I

wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.

LUMP

Thanks, Professor.

DORR

Well gentlemen, here you are, men of

different backgrounds and differing

talents, men with, in fact only two

things in common: one, you all saw

fit to answer my little advertisement

in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two,

you are all going to be, in

consequence, very very incredibly

rich. Let us revel in our adventure,

gentlemen. Let us make beautiful

music together. And above all,

gentlemen, let us keep it to

ourselves. What we say in this root

cellar, let it stay in this root

cellar.

LUMP

There's no "I" in "team".

DORR

...Lump has a very excellent point.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. MUNSON

That's okay, don't stop on account

of me.

DORR

No no, madam, we were about to take

a break anyway. The glissandi on

this particular piece are technically

very demanding and I think we would

all welcome a moment of relaxation.

MRS. MUNSON

Huh. I just thought you might like

to see-what a you gotten up to, honey?

Why you sweatin' like that.

LUMP

I, uh...

GAWAIN

That man plays one bitch barrelful a

sackbutt. Ain't no one can blow the

tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee!

goes at that thing like it was a pu--

uh, like it was a woman! Goddamn! He--

MRS. MUNSON

You mind! I don't want that kind of

talk in my home, even in the root

cellar. This is a Christian house,

boy, none of that hippity-hop

language.

DORR

Sadly, Gawain is given to--

MRS. MUNSON

Sometimes it's the only way!

MRS. MUNSON

...I'm tryin' to help you, son!

MRS. MUNSON

...Better yaself!

DORR

As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain

at times is so far transported by

his love of the music of the early

Renaissance as to--

MRS. MUNSON

Don't make no never-mind he's

transported!

DORR

I understand your--

MRS. MUNSON

You been smokin'?

DORR

Certainly not, madam. I understand

your indignation. And I was offering

explanation, not excuse. I myself am

offended by those who cannot find

the proper words to express themselves

and have recourse to--

GAWAIN

Don't you be explainin' me, dawg!

You can't look into my mind, cape

man!

DORR

Yes, yes...

DORR

...A fiery lad! But then Youth is

fiery! A fact often remarked upon by

the poets of the Romantic era.

MRS. MUNSON

My youth I was in church, I wasn't

walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no

excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway...

only came down to show you the fife.

MRS. MUNSON

...Othar's fife. He burned his own.

DORR

...Did he?

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical

man you'd be interested.

DORR

Oh, I am indeed--

MRS. MUNSON

Cut it himself and burned the holes.

Israelites called it a kalil.

DORR

Ah.

MRS. MUNSON

Kalil, fife, same thing. You can

read about it in the Bible. Ain't

nothin' new under the sun.

DORR

Indeed not.

MRS. MUNSON

Gone these twenty years. He was some

kind of man.

MRS. MUNSON

...Blowed the kalil.

DORR

...I don't suppose Othar ever turned

his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh,

turned his lip -- to the shofar?

DORR

...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded

by the priests of the Hebrews?

MRS. MUNSON

I don't know nothin' 'bout that.

Othar didn't study no shofar, to the

extent a my knowledge. The kalil was

good enough for my Othar...

MRS. MUNSON

...Some kind of man.

GAWAIN (O.S.)

Hey baby, don't be cruel. Jus' sneak

one little peek...

GAWAIN

...Don't let this uniform fool ya--

GAWAIN

You don't need to be gamblin', honey,

you lookin' at a sure thing. They

call me Mr. 21, baby, 'cause that's

how I measure up. I am the original

black Jack, honey, accept no

substitutions. You can pull my lever

all day long, sweet mama, I ain't

never gonna come up lemons. That's

right, sugar, you can blow on my

dice any ol' time.

GAWAIN

But Mr. Gudge, she had an ass that

could pull a bus. This lady was fine,

fine, dandy, divine.

GUDGE

I don't care how big her ass was,

MacSam. You're fired.

GAWAIN

Say what?

GUDGE

There is no fraternizing with

customers on the Lady Luck. Clean

out your locker.

GAWAIN

But Gudge-

GUDGE

Get out of here. You're fired.

GAWAIN

You can't fire me. I sue your ass!

GUDGE

Sue me? For what?

GAWAIN

Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages,

man!

GUDGE

Punitive damages.

GAWAIN

Ya damn skippy. I know you firin' my

ass 'cause I'm black!

GUDGE

Everyone on the custodial staff is

black, MacSam. Your replacement's

gonna be black. His replacement will

no doubt be black.

GAWAIN

Fuckin' judge is gonna be black,

motherfucker, that's who gonna be

black! You gonna stand tall before

the man!

DORR

Oh my. Oh my my my my my. This is a

severe setback. I am distraught. I

am more than distraught, I am

devastated. Oh my, this is quite the

monkey-wrench heaved into the

meticulously engineered construct of

our little escapade.

LUMP

Yeah, it fucks things up.

DORR

I am beside myself. I am at a positive

loss for words.

GAWAIN

You still talkin' okay though.

WAITRESS

Have you all decided?

DORR

Oh madam, we must have waffles. We

must all have waffles forthwith!

DORR

...Oh we must think. We must all

have waffles and think, each and

every one of us to the very best of

his ability! Perhaps if you apologized

to the man and gave him flowers, or

perhaps a fruit basket, with a card

depicting a misty seascape and

inscribed with a sentiment.

GAWAIN

Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'!

He fired me 'cause I'm black!

PANCAKE

He can't do that. You could sue him.

Open and shut case.

GAWAIN

Fuckin' A.

PANCAKE

This is not 1952.

GAWAIN

Man's a fuckin' bigot.

DORR

Well then, perhaps, surely, a

chocolate assortment has been known

to warm the heart of even the most

hardened misanthrope, especially if

it's a premium chocolate, imported,

say, from Switzerland, or the

Netherlands, or some other of the so-

called "Low" countries be they Dutch

or Flemish or Walloon--

GAWAIN

Walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna

roll over for a fuckin' candy bar!

PANCAKE

I'm afraid there's a setback on the

tunneling front too. We've run into

a pretty large rock, and--

GENERAL

-- Rock!

GENERAL

...Very bad.

DORR

Oh my my, it seems that the poet was

right: Troubles never singly come.

PANCAKE

Oh, we can get through the rock, no

worries there. Simplest thing in the

world. Why we blow right through it;

I've got a pyro license, we bore a

hole in the rock, pack in a little

plastique; igneous blows pretty good,

and we--

LUMP

Is he gonna want a piece of the

action?

PANCAKE

...Who?

LUMP

...Igneous?

MOUNTAIN GIRL (O.S.)

Hello Clark. Am I ordering the prima

cord?

PANCAKE

Yes, Mountain, we were just talking

about that, and some plastique.

GAWAIN

...The fuck is this?

PANCAKE

This is Mountain Girl. Mountain is

my right hand. She helps me with

ordnance. Helps me with damn near

everything.

GAWAIN

...You brought your bitch to the

waffle house?!

DORR

I confess myself to be puzzled as

well. I thought we all understood

that, so far as our little enterprise

is concerned, mum, as the saying

would have it, is the word--

PANCAKE

Of course. I understand that. But

this is Mountain...

PANCAKE

...I don't keep secrets from Mountain.

That's not how you maintain a loving,

caring relationship.

GAWAIN

...You brought your bitch to the

waffle house?

GAWAIN

...Man brings his bitch to the waffle

house!

PANCAKE

Look, you, I'll thank you to stop

referring to Mountain that way. She's

the other half of my life.

GAWAIN

Everybody lookin' at me like I'm a

fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job,

and this motherfucker bring his bitch

to the waffle house!

PANCAKE

You son of a bitch punk! Shut your

goddamn mouth!

GAWAIN

Come and get me motherfuck! Come on,

baby, let's get it on!

DORR

Gentlemen, please!

DORR

...Gentlemen, this sort of behavior

does you no credit in the eyes of

your colleagues, or in those of the

other patrons of this waffle house!

PANCAKE

...Nobody talks to Mountain Girl

that way. She had an abusive family!

GAWAIN

Fuck you, man.

PANCAKE

Little punk. I got syrup on my safari

jacket.

DORR

Gentlemen, I propose that we consider

the matter of this woman, Mountain

Water, to be--

PANCAKE

Mountain Girl.

DORR

I am so very sorry. I propose that

we consider this matter to be closed,

and we shall chose to trust her,

since we now have no choice, and

since she shall share only in Mr.

Pancake's portion of the booty.

PANCAKE

Of course. Wouldn't have it any other

way.

GAWAIN

Damn right you won't.

PANCAKE

Up yours, punk.

DORR

Gentlemen! And the manner of disposing

of our igneous impediment is also

settled. That leaves only the question

of Gawain retrieving his job.

LUMP

Couldn't you just bribe the guy?

MRS. MUNSON

...You just a readin' fool, ain't

you Mr. Dorr.

DORR

Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that

often I feel more at home in these

ancient volumes than I do in the

hustle-bustle of our modern world.

To me, paradoxically, the literature

of the so-called "dead tongues" has

more currency than this mornin's

newspaper.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-mm.

DORR

In these books...

DORR

...In these volumes, there is the

accum'lated wisdom a mankind which

succours me when the day is hard or

the night lonely and long.

MRS. MUNSON

Wisdom of mankind, what about the

wisdom of the Lord?

DORR

Oh yes, the Good Book, mm. I have

found reward in its pages. But for

me there are other good books as

well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity,

freighted with the insights of Man's

glorious age. And then of course I

love, love, love the works of Mr. Ed

G'Allan Poe.

MRS. MUNSON

I know who he is. Kinda creepy.

DORR

Oh no, madam, noooo. Not of this

world, true; he lived in a dream, an

ancient dream...

DORR

"Helen, they beauty is to me Like

those Nicean barks a yore That gently,

o'er a perfumed sea, The weary,

wayworn wanderer bore To his own

native shore... "

MRS. MUNSON

Who was Helen? She wasn't a loose

woman, was she? Some kinda whore a

Babylon?

DORR

One doesn't know who Helen was, though

I picture her as bein' very, very

extremely... pale.

DORR

...Miz Munson, I was tryin' to think

of some way of expressin' my gratitude

to you for takin' in...

DORR

...this weary, wayworn wanderer...

DORR

...It's just a modest little ol'

present, why it's practically nothing

at all.

MRS. MUNSON

Oh Mr. Dorr, why you are such a

gallant man...

DORR

Oh no madam, I blush. I melt. No, I

just happened to hear of this gospel

concert tomorrow night, The Mighty

Mighty Clouds of Joy, and I thought

you and a friend from church,

perhaps...

MRS. MUNSON

Othar loved that music... Yes, I got

a widow-lady friend...

DORR

The concert is up in Memphis, but I

have arranged for a car service to

transport you thither and, needless

to say, back home at the concert's

termination. My friends and I will

be rehearsing here tomorrow evening

so you needn't worry about the

security of your charming little old

house...

MRS. MUNSON

Huh? Excuse me.

MRS. MUNSON

Sheriff Wyner, how you doin'...

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Evenin', Miz Munson, I just came

by...

SHERIFF

...to let you know I had a word with

WeeMack. He says he gonna comply

with your request, keep the music

down and neighborly.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hm.

SHERIFF

So you have a pleasant evening now,

and just let us know--

MRS. MUNSON

Hang on there, Sheriff, somebody I

want you to meet.

SHERIFF

Ma'am, I'm a little pressed for time--

MRS. MUNSON

Why, you chasin' a gang of bank

robbers? Get on in here say hello.

MRS. MUNSON

...We was just havin' tea, talkin'

about Othar--

MRS. MUNSON

...Hm... Bussed his own dishes. You

can always tell a gentleman.

SHERIFF

Someone was here, ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hm, with me'n Othar.

SHERIFF

Well, maybe I'll catch him next

time...

MRS. MUNSON

Come on up to his room.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm, he's neat.

SHERIFF

Very neat.

MRS. MUNSON

Probably went down to the cellar to

play with his friends.

SHERIFF

Ma'am, I really have to...

SHERIFF

...be gettin' back...

MRS. MUNSON

What the...

MRS. MUNSON

...What the... Why, Professor!

MRS. MUNSON

...What you doin' havin' tea down

there?!

MRS. MUNSON

...Land of Goshen! Get out from under

there!

SHERIFF

Miz Munson, my pager just went off...

MRS. MUNSON

Why of all the...

SHERIFF

'Fraid I gotta respond...

SHERIFF

...I'll try to meet your friend some

other time.

DORR

Well that was very... refreshing...

As you know...

DORR

...we academics are inordinately

fond of wedgin' ourselves into

confined spaces. At Yale the students

will see how many of their number

they can enclose in a telephone booth;

Harvard, a broom closet.

MRS. MUNSON

Why I never!

DORR

There was the goldfish-swallowin'

craze, of course, a different but

related phenomenon... Ahem... I hope

I didn't spill any tea...

GUDGE (O.S.)

What the hell is this?

GAWAIN

It's just my way of sayin', well,

goddamnit, I don't know what it's

like walkin' in your shoes, bein'

all tightass and all, and you don't

know what it's like to walk in my

shoes, but, well...

GAWAIN

...You know, there's the custodian,

and then there's the man inside the

custodian, y'understand what I'm

sayin'...

GAWAIN

...and that man has needs, dig, and

I guess those needs, Mr. Gudge, which

they usually involve women with big

asses, well those motherfuckin' needs

sometimes well up over the custodian

like the motherfuckin' Johnstown

Flood. But my point is it ain't gonna

happen again. Not if it's humanly

possible...

GUDGE

Hmm...

GAWAIN

But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on

that girl, Mr. Gudge, you'd a wanted

her sitting on your face too.

GUDGE

Well, we're all human.

GAWAIN

Ya damn skippy.

GUDGE

This apology buys you a one-week

probationary period. Stay away from

the customers, MacSam.

PANCAKE

The drill bit's getting awfully hot.

Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson

sprayer and spritz it down while I

drill.

GAWAIN

Fuck you, man, I ain't your house

nigger. I'm the inside man!

PANCAKE

Look, are you gonna have a bug up

your ass for the rest of the time we

work together?

LUMP

I'll get the sprayer.

PANCAKE

No no, me and this gentleman here

have to get square. Let me tell you

something, MacSam. You wanna know

something?

GAWAIN

I don't wanna know shit from you.

PANCAKE

I'm gonna tell you how I came down

to Mississippi. Wasn't born here,

you know. I'm from Scranton,

Pennsylvania...

PANCAKE

...Nnnff!

GAWAIN

Huh?

PANCAKE

...Scranton, Pennsylvania. Came down

here in 1964. Greyhound Bus. With

the Freedom Riders. You know who the

Freedom Riders were, MacSam?

GAWAIN

I don't give a shit who they were.

Just tell me when they gonna leave.

PANCAKE

The Freedom Riders, my fine young

man, were a group of concerned

liberals from up North -- whites,

Negros, and yes, Jewish people --

all working together, just like we

are here. Concerned citizens who

came down here so that local black

people could have their civil

liberties. So that people like you

could have the vote.

GAWAIN

...You know what, man?

PANCAKE

What, brother?

GAWAIN

I don't vote. So fuck you.

PANCAKE

Why you fucking--

GAWAIN

And the bus you rode in on!

PANCAKE

That's it!

PANCAKE

...Let's step outside, MacSam!

DORR

Yes, madam?

MRS. MUNSON

My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so

I'm about to go on out. I just wanted

to leave y'all with some cinnamon

cookies...

MRS. MUNSON

...Y'all sound pretty good. It'd be

nice if you'd come by the church

some day, give us a recital.

DORR

Oh madam, you are too kind. Our music,

however, is -- how shall I put it? --

rather Roman in its outlook; many of

our pieces were commissioned by the

Holy See.

MRS. MUNSON

Oh, I see all right, but we don't

make a big whoop-dee-do about

denominations; everybody welcome at

our church. We've had Methodists

come in. Episcopals. Even had a Jew

come in once with a guitar back in

the sixties.

DORR

Indeed. Excuse me, one moment, ma'am,

and I shall see you off...

DORR

...If you gentlemen can labor

harmoniously in the course of my

absence, then perhaps upon my return

we shall be prepared to explode that

vexin' ol' piece a igneous.

GAWAIN

He's the motherfuckin' piece of

igneous.

MRS. MUNSON

Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes,

Rosalie, Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.D.

ROSALIE

Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters.

DORR

Well of course in my youth I was

simply known as Goldthwait...

PANCAKE

All right, safety meeting, let's

listen up. General, could you hand

me the prima cord and the compound

there. Before we set the charge we'll

run through our procedure.

PANCAKE

...I have earplugs for whoever wants

them. Just wedge them in your ears.

Now here we have -- not yet, Lump.

PANCAKE

...Now. Prima cord. Gelatinite. C4.

Time comes, we pack the hole in the

rock with the C4 and insert two leads.

A...

PANCAKE

...and B.

PANCAKE

...Charge comes from a battery that

is inside this plunger. Ordinary

auto battery, you can pick it up at

Sears, easiest thing in the world...

DORR

I remember my father telling me --

and it is one of the few memories I

retain of the man, from one of his

visits home, and how I do cherish it --

he said, "Goldthwait, you are not

formed as other little boys."

ROSALIE

Mm-mm.

MRS. MUNSON

He a man of learnin'?

DORR

G.H. number two was self-educated;

he had no career, as such, though

the state recognized the breadth of

his readin' by making him librarian

at the state nervous hospital in

Meridian, where he was a distinguished

inmate.

PANCAKE

This is the same procedure we will

be using when we collapse the tunnel

after entering the casino vault and

returning to the root cellar.

PANCAKE

...This is for your own protection,

so pay close attention. Once these

materials are combined only the

professionals may handle them. That

means me, or the General. Separately

they are harmless-completely inert.

Why, you could light this stuff on

fire, hit it with a hammer--

MRS. MUNSON

...What in the name of heaven was

that?

DORR

I'm... quite sure... that there is...

no cause for alarm...

DORR

...Why, I'm not even absolutely

certain that I heard anything at

all.

MRS. MUNSON

Didn't hear anything?!

DORR

Well, something, perhaps, but...

DORR

...nothing that need discompose us,

was the sense I was trying to

convey...

DORR

...Miz Munson, I will not have you

missing your musical recital. Why,

you go ahead now. Miz Funthes, you

as well, I beg of you...

DORR

...I shall call the gas company, or

the water company, or whatever

subterranean utility is implicated

in this little... occurrence... I

shall see to the matter... as only a

highly educated classicist could.

LUMP

Blood, Professor! Oh my God! Blood!

PANCAKE

...why, it's nothing to make a fuss

about. Perfectly all right... happens

all the time...

GAWAIN

...You gotta go find it, dipshit!

PANCAKE

...No, no. Really, I'm perfectly all

right.

GAWAIN

Perfectly all right? You just blew

your fucking finger off!

PANCAKE

Sure, but--

GAWAIN

Well get back down there and find

it, man! I ain't pickin' up your

goddamn finger!

DORR

I gather there was a premature

detonation--

GAWAIN

They can sew that shit back on, jack!

Like that guy his wife cut his dick

off! Just sewed that motherfucker

back on!

PANCAKE

Of course. Simplest thing in the

world. Microsurgery--

GAWAIN

Saw that motherfucker in a porno!

Thing still works!

PANCAKE

Oh yes, they have remarkable abilities

in the, uh...

MRS. MUNSON

They using the house to practice

music a the rococo.

ROSALIE

Mmmm-hm.

VOICES (O.S.)

Get him!

DORR

I propose that we get our fallen

comrade to the hospital, and the

General shall follow when he manages

to recover the severed digit.

PANCAKE

I don't know what all the fuss is

about.

MRS. MUNSON

PICKLES!

MRS. MUNSON

...You catch Pickles now!

DORR

The house is perfectly in order, but

we need medical attention for Mr.

Pancake who, during the disturbance,

pinched his finger in a valve of the

sackbutt.

MRS. MUNSON

You let the cat out!

DORR

The General is even now exercising

every effort to retrieve your

mischievous little pet. Please go,

go and enjoy your concert, and we

shall see you later in the evening.

Au revoir, mes dames!

DORR (O.S.)

Despite our little setback we find

ourselves on schedule to penetrate

the vault...

DORR

...here, this afternoon, having

successfully blasted that little ol'

rock to pieces during Miz Munson's

choir practice.

DORR

...Clark, perhaps you can run us

through the game plan for what remains

of our tunnelin'.

PANCAKE (O.S.)

Of course. Why, it's child's play

now, easiest thing in the world.

Only a couple of feet separate us

from the vault...

PANCAKE

...Just the usual spadework until we

hit the masonry of the vault, and

then we drill through.

DORR

And will you be able to wield the

drill with your maimed extremity?

PANCAKE

Oh, I should think so, it's only one

finger. Inhibits me in doing finer

work, of course. I'll always have to

live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and

I'm just thinking out loud here,

maybe since, as you say, it will

present problems later...

DORR

Yes, Clark?

PANCAKE

Well, maybe -- and this is something

I've talked over with Mountain Girl,

and she agrees with me, so it's not

just one person's opinion -- maybe I

should get a little extra compensation

for the accident.

PANCAKE

...Somewhat larger share. Why, if

this were any other line of work I'd

be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't

I? Might even have a pretty good

lawsuit.

GAWAIN

You gonna sue yaself for blowin' off

your finger?

PANCAKE

Well that is simply asinine--

DORR

Yes but you see, Clark, this is not

what you just called "some other

line of work."

PANCAKE

But if it were--

DORR

This is a criminal enterprise, not

to put too fine a point on it,

entailin' all manner a risks not

involved in honest labor. Governmental

regulations an' civic safeguards

cannot be assumed to apply to

antisocial pursuits.

LUMP

Yeah, but he lost his finger.

GAWAIN

We don't give a shit! Man can blow

his own dick off, don't make no

nevermind to us! We don't gotta pay

the man for goin' around blowin' off

body parts! Getcha head outcha ass,

man!

PANCAKE

Look, you--

DORR

I think that in this instance Gawain

has a very excellent point. I--

GENERAL

No extra share!

PANCAKE

Well, okay, majority rules, like I

say, it was just a trial balloon.

Hand's not so bad really, I even get

some phantom feeling.

GAWAIN

You pull on your prick you get phantom

feeling. Greedy motherfuck.

DORR

Now that that matter is settled, let

us synchronize our watches before

Gawain reports to work. In... twenty

seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen

exactly... fifteen...

PANCAKE

It will be twelve-fifteen?

DORR

No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven

seconds -- it will be twelve-

sixteen... eight...

LUMP

Professor?

DORR

Six... five -- yes, Lump?

LUMP

I don't have a watch.

ELRON (O.S.)

Yeah?

GAWAIN

Me, dickwad.

GAWAIN

Well ain't that somethin'.

PANCAKE

Hnnnn. Arrunggggh! Rnffff.

PANCAKE

...Mmmmnggh!

PANCAKE

...IBS!

GAWAIN

...Say what?

PANCAKE

IBS! Irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is

there a men's room down here?!

GAWAIN

Oh man, you shouldn't be using the

men's room--

PANCAKE

Or a lady's room! IBS! Quickly!

GAWAIN

You shoulda shit back in the house,

man! We don't want Elron finding you

in the goddamn crapper!

PANCAKE

No choice! Quickly! It's a medical

condition!

GAWAIN

You are disgusting, man. All right,

follow me.

PANCAKE

Feel thirty pounds lighter.

PANCAKE

...Thank you for being so

understanding. Not everyone is, of

course, which is why the biggest

challenge of IBS is educating the

public. Afflicts over two million

people yet most of us have never

heard of it. And it strikes without

regard to age, gender or race.

GAWAIN

Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know

about it.

PANCAKE

That's the kind of attitude we're

fighting.

GAWAIN

Well maybe you should sign me up,

man, 'cause you startin' to irritate

my bowel.

PANCAKE

...I guess I never told you, that's

how Mountain Girl and I met. They

had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's,

in the Catskills. Of course the

tourist business up there has

suffered, with the demise of the

Borscht Belt. So they have different

promotions, mixers, so on. This was

a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles

to meet and support each other and

share stories.

GAWAIN

Man, I don't wanna hear a single one

a them stories.

PANCAKE

Well, some of them are very--

GAWAIN

Not one fuckin' story! You one fucked-

up motherfucker! You--

LUMP

Hey, lookit that.

PANCAKE

Huh. Looks like an Ikegami.

PANCAKE

...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure

whether it's broadcasting...

PANCAKE

...Um-hm... No...

PANCAKE

...Hard wire...

PANCAKE

Look, I didn't choose to have IBS--

GAWAIN

Shut the fuck up!

PANCAKE

There's no cure, you know. Only

control. Lifelong condition. Not

complaining, just fact. And I did

meet Mountain.

GAWAIN

Grab your bag and get in that fucking

hole!

DORR

Welcome back, gentlemen, mission

accomplished I see. I am so very

very delighted...

DORR

...Congratulations. Congratulations.

I have some cold duck on ice for the

occasion.

LUMP

Maybe we could have something to

drink, too.

GAWAIN

Motherfucker can't stop talking,

can't stop shitting. Motherfucker

tell everyone about his motherfuckin'

asshole. No one gives a shit about

his asshole. Nobody interested in

another man's asshole. Or his bitch's.

DORR

Gentlemen, to we few. We who have

shared each other's company, each

other's care, each other's joy, and

who now reap the fruits of our

communal effits, shoulder to shoulder,

from each accordin' to his abilities

so forth whatnot. We have had our

little diffences along the way, it's

true, but I like to think they have

only made us value one another the

more, each coming to understand and

appreciate the other's unique

qualities, potencies, and, yes,

foibles. I suggest that we shall

look back upon this caper one day,

one distant day, grandchildren dandled

upon our knee, and perhaps a tear

will form, and we shall say, Well,

with wit, and grit, and no small

amount of courage, we accomplished

something on that day, a feat of

derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble --

we, merry band, unbound by the

constraints of society and the

prejudices of the common ruck, we

happy few. Gentlemen -- to us!

MEN

To us!

PANCAKE

Charge should've gone off already.

DORR

I do beg your pardon?

PANCAKE

The charge to collapse the tunnel. I

set it for eight minutes.

DORR

Well that time, and more, has most

certainly elapsed.

DORR

I need not remind you of the

importance of obliterating any trace

of a connection between the vault

and this house. It was of the essence

of this plan that it should appear

that the money had simply vanished.

Without a trace. Spirited away, as

it were, by ghosts.

PANCAKE

Of course. I understand.

DORR

The conundrum of the undisturbed yet

empty vault, the unsolvable riddle

of the sealed yet violated sanctum,

is of the utmost importance not only

to make our caper innelectually

satisfying. It is also exigent as a

matter of practical fact: I remind

you that if a tunnel is ever found

leading to this house, this house's

owner knows all of your names.

PANCAKE

She certainly does.

DORR

Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable

conclusion -- someone shall have to

reenter the tunnel to reset that

charge.

PANCAKE

Huh.

PANCAKE

Nnnnrungh...

PANCAKE

...Huh?

PANCAKE

...What the--

GAWAIN

...You just fart?

ELRON

Heh-heh-heh.

PANCAKE (O.S.)

Perfectly all right. Not a problem.

LUMP (O.S.)

Well there sure as shit ain't no

tunnel left.

MRS. MUNSON

Professor, I'm surprised.

DORR

...Properly speaking, madam, we have

been surprised; you are taken aback.

Though I acknowledge that the sense

you intend is gaining currency through

increasing use.

DORR

...You have returned from your

devotions betimes.

MRS. MUNSON

I hadda fix tea. I wanna talk to

you, Professor, don't you be leavin'.

And don't make any more noise! And

you!

MRS. MUNSON

...I told you, I don't want any

smokin' in here!

LUMP

She saw everything. She saw our

hole...

LUMP

...She saw our hole, Professor!

DORR

Yes... Yes...

LUMP

What do we do?

DORR

Well, first, my dear boy, we follow

the General's example...

DORR

...and refrain from panic. Secondly,

we cooly, calmly, collectedly think...

think...

DORR

Hsst... Madam...

DORR

...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a

word...

MRS. MUNSON

You get back down those stairs!

DORR

I assure you I shall be--

MRS. MUNSON

Hush! Down those stairs! We havin'

tea now! I be down shortly.

MRS. MUNSON

...He's the tenant.

LADIES

Mm-hm.

DORR

She shall be down shortly...

DORR

...Tea. Dainties.

MRS. MUNSON

I don't know what you boys been up

to but I wasn't born yesterday and I

know mischief when I see it. Now I

want an explanation, but first I

want you boys to get your fannies up

here with y'alls period instruments.

I been tellin' the ladies about your

music and they wanna hear you play.

MRS. MUNSON

...Hmph.

LUMP

Professor?

DORR

Yes, Lump?

LUMP

I can't really play the buttsack.

DORR

Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you

will have to accept our apologies

for failing to perform since, as you

see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is

still at work and we could no more

play with one part tacit than a horse

could canter shy one leg.

LADIES

Mm-hmm.

MRS. MUNSON

Hmph.

DORR

Perhaps I could offer as a poor but

ready substitute a brief poetic

recital. Though I don't pretend to

great oratorical skills, I will

happily present, with your ladies'

permission, verse from the unquiet

mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.

DORR

..."Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like

those Nicean barks of yore..."

DORR

"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea

The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To

his own native shore... "

VOICE

Amen.

DORR

"On desperate seas long wont to roam,

Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,

Thy Naiad airs have brought me home

To the glory that was Greece And the

grandeur that was Rome... "

VOICES

Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah.

LADY

That was soooome poem.

LADY

...You know any?

GAWAIN

Y'all been celebratin'?.

DORR

Goodbye, ladies. We had such a

pleasant time.

MRS. MUNSON

Now, I wanna know what's goin' on.

DORR

Yes indeed, and the thirst for

knowledge is a very commendable thing.

Though in this instance, I believe

when you hear the explanation, you

will laugh riotously, slappin' your

knee and perhaps even wipin' away a

giddy tear, relieved of your former

concern.

MRS. MUNSON

Hmph.

DORR

You see Lump here is an enthusiastic

collector of Indian arrowheads and,

having found one simply lying on

your cellar floor, a particularly

rare artifact of the Natchez tribe,

he enlisted us in an all-out effort

to sift through the subsoil in search

of others. Well, in doing so, we

apparently hit a motherlode of natural

gas -- I myself became acutely aware

of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and

it was at just this unfortunate moment

that the General here violated one

of the cardinal rules of this house

and lit himself a cigarette.

GENERAL

So sorry.

MRS. MUNSON

...What about all that money?

DORR

...Ah. The money. The money is...

Mr. Pancake's.

PANCAKE

That's right.

DORR

He only just re-mortgaged his house

in order to pay for the procedure

that will correct the wandering eye

of his common-law wife, Mountain

Water, who suffers from astygmia and

strabismus and a general curdling of

the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake

however is an ardent foe of the

federal reserve and is in fact one

of those eccentrics about whom one

occasionally reads, hoarding his

entire life savings either under the

proverbial mattress or, as in Mr.

Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that

is his constant companion.

DORR

...Steel Sack.

PANCAKE

Don't trust the banks. Never have.

MRS. MUNSON

This don't smell right. I'm callin'

Sheriff Wyner.

DORR

Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It

was a lie! A fantastic tale! You

have us! Dead to rights! But please

allow me to tell you the truth -- in

private.

DORR

Madam...

DORR

...What I am about to reveal to you,

you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson,

I must tell you that we are not...

what we appear.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hm.

DORR

We are not in fact musicians of the

late Renaissance. Nor of the early

or mid period. We are, in fact...

criminals! Desperate men, madam! We

have tunneled into the nearby offices

of the Lady Luck gambling emporium

and have relieved it of its treasure!

MRS. MUNSON

Lord have mercy!

DORR

It is true that the Lady Luck is a

den of iniquity, a painted harlot

luring people into sin and exciting

the vice of greed with her false

promise of easy winnings. Oh, her

gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I

offer no excuses -- save one! We men

have each pledged half of our share

of the booty to a charitable

institution -- the General, to a

placement service for Southeast Asian

refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue

Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump

to the United Jewish Appeal. As

compensation for use of your house

we had planned to donate a full share

to Bob Jones University, without

burdening you with guilty knowledge

by informing you of same. But you

have wrested the information from

me! Now it is all on the table. Now

you have it, the whole story, the

awful truth.

MRS. MUNSON

Stolen money!

DORR

Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it,

yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson,

I challenge you! Even the casino

itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall

suffer no harm! It has an insurance

company, a financial behemoth that

will cheerfully replenish its depleted

vaults! That is its function! And

the insurance company itself is made

up of tens and tens of thousands of

policy-holders so that -- we have

done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! --

so that at the end of the day, at

the final reckoning, each policy-

holder shall have contributed only

one penny -- one single solitary

cent -- to the satisfaction of this

claim.

MRS. MUNSON

...Just one penny?

DORR

Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent

from thousands upon thousands of

people so that Bob Jones University

can continue on its mission! Why, I

have no doubt that, were the policy-

holders aware of the existence of

that august institution, why, each

and every one of them would have

volunteered some token amount to the

furtherance of its aims!

MRS. MUNSON

Well that's prob'ly true...

DORR

Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain

is upon my soul, but the benefit

shall accrue to any number of worthy

causes. As long, that is, as the

secret stays with us. And I, surely,

shall not be the one to divulge it.

MRS. MUNSON

Well... it's hard to see the harm in

it... One penny...

MRS. MUNSON

...I'm sorry, Professor.

DORR

Excuse me, ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

No. It's wrong. Don't you be leadin'

me into temptation.

DORR

Madam, I must strenuously protest--

MRS. MUNSON

No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'.

I know your intentions were good,

and I won't call the police if you

give the money back. But I gotta see

that you do it.

DORR

Madam--

MRS. MUNSON

And all a you gotta go to church

with me next Sunday.

DORR

And... engage in divine worship?

MRS. MUNSON

I made up my mind. You can double-

talk all you want, but its church or

the county jail.

DORR

But--

MRS. MUNSON

You think it over. I gotta feed the

cat.

GAWAIN

Motherfuck!

DORR

Yes. Unfortunately, Mrs. Munson has

rather complicated the situation--

GAWAIN

I know how to discomplicate it! Put

a cap in the old lady's head! Then

everything simple again!

DORR

...Not easy to do. Many reasons.

Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood,

a sleepy town. Reasons of moral

repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed

conceived and executed in cold blood.

No, Gawain; would that it were simple!

GAWAIN

Well -- fuck, man! What we gonna do,

give the money back and go to church?!

DORR

I shudder. I quake.

DORR

...You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there

not a middle way?

GENERAL

Must float like a leaf on the river

of life. And kill old lady.

DORR

Well... I suppose you are right. It

is the active nature of the crime,

though, that so horrifies -- the

squeezing of the trigger, the plunging

of the knife. But, think a moment --

look at the other tools we have at

hand.

DORR

...We have the cellar. We have masonry

and trowel. Perhaps we could simply...

immure her.

PANCAKE

Sure, easiest thing in the world. I

could whip up a little mortar in one

of those snow saucers, lay the bricks,

anchor in some chains, Mountain has

a source for the manacles...

DORR

Ahh but gentlemen, we delude

ourselves. Think of the woman's

piteous moans as we lay tier upon

tier of brick. Think of her

lamentations as we fit the last brick

into place, appealing to our better

selves, the higher angels of our

nature, our recollections of our own

sainted mothers... No, I fear that

we lack the sand to commit such an

act. No... no... shortest and most

painless is best. Let us confront

reality. Gawain's gun... the retort

muffled by a pillow... into the

brain... the affair of an instant.

The only question is... who wields

the weapon.

DORR

...I believe it is traditional, in

such circumstances, to draw straws.

PANCAKE

Well, sure, fair enough.

PANCAKE

...I'm thinking, though, that since

I lost my finger -- I mean, literally

lost it because of that goddamn cat --

maybe I should be excused from this

thing. Hard for me to squeeze a

trigger anyway--

GAWAIN

You one whiney motherfucker! I squeeze

your nutsack you keep that up!

PANCAKE

Listen, punk--

DORR

Gentlemen, no special pleading, no

exceptions. It's in the nature of

the situation that we would all prefer

to be excused.

PANCAKE

Well, okay... it was just a trial

balloon...

PANCAKE

Long straw. You all see it. All your

fuss over nothing, punk.

GAWAIN

...Motherfucker...

MAMA

What you got there, Gawain?

CHILD GAWAIN

Why -- nothin', mama.

MAMA

Nothin' my ass! You got a dog there!

CHILD GAWAIN

No, Mama!

MAMA

A filthy noisy little pest of a puppy

dog gonna shit all over the house!

CHILD GAWAIN

He won't shit in the house, Mama,

I'm gonna train him, I promise, gonna

train him real good--

MAMA

I'm gonna train you real good! I

told you don't bring no stray dogs

into this house!

MAMA

...You wait til your Daddy gets home,

he gonna lay into you proper!

CHILD GAWAIN

Please don't hurt me no more! I love

you, Mama!

MAMA

Daddy gonna kick your ass!

MAMA

...Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog!

SISTER

Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!

BROTHER

(eagerly)

Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?

CHILD GAWAIN

Please don't hurt me, Mama!

MRS. MUNSON

What you doin'? What you doin' with

my pillow there?

GAWAIN

I'm sorry, ma'am, I--

MRS. MUNSON

I'm displeased with you! Colored boy

like you, falling in with that trash

downstairs!

MRS. MUNSON

...Ashamed a yourself! Didn't your

mama raise you right!

GAWAIN

I can't do it!

DORR

Why... this is most... irregular.

GAWAIN

She reminds me of my mama. I can't

shoot my mama! You motherfuckers

just draw straws again.

PANCAKE

Wait a minute. You've got to accept

your responsibilities, young man.

GAWAIN

Fuck you. And your irritated bowel.

I can't shoot that old lady.

GENERAL

Must shoot!

PANCAKE

Now look here, it's the easiest thing

in the world. Pretend her head is a

casaba melon, and the gun is a melon-

baller, and--

GAWAIN

What the fuck you talkin' about,

man? You think this a melon-baller,

you do it, man!

DORR

My my, this is most irregular.

PANCAKE

Look, with equal rights come equal

responsibilities--

DORR

I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right,

my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws

again; the exercise loses all

credibility if you show that the

loser can simply beg off doing the

job.

GENERAL

Must shoot!

GAWAIN

She just an old colored lady to you --

you do it, man!

PANCAKE

Why you sniveling little coward!

GAWAIN

What you say, you whiney motherfucker?

I come up your irritated ass with

this -- motherfuckin' gun--

PANCAKE

You think you scare me, you mewling

punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor

and all his dogs didn't scare me!

PANCAKE

...Be a man!

GAWAIN

You fuck!

PANCAKE

Be a man!

GAWAIN

You ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a

sixty-year-old lady in pigtails!

PANCAKE

WHY YOU BASTARD PUNK! MOUNTAIN GIRL

IS FIFTY-THREE!

PANCAKE

...SHE COULD RIDE YOUR ASS TO JELLY!

DORR

Gentlemen, please!

GAWAIN

I seen Virginia hams I'd rather stick

my dick in than your old--

PANCAKE

...Oh my god...

PANCAKE

...I think he's hit!

PANCAKE

...I'll just check the carotid artery.

PANCAKE

...That's a negative.

LUMP

Oh, fuck.

DORR

Oh my.

LUMP

Is he dead, Professor?

PANCAKE

Sure he's dead. I checked his carotid

artery.

DORR

Well this is most irregular. We will

need a Hefty bag.

DORR

She is in the kitchen. I shall

distract her while you steal out

with the carcass.

DORR

Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have

outlined your position to my

colleagues and I now return to you

to return our collective verdict.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hmm.

DORR

There was much spirited discussion

and an atmosphere of frank give-and-

take. Some of our number were

initially appalled at your proposal

that we simply return the money;

some were more receptive.

MRS. MUNSON

I don't care they was receptive or

not!

DORR

And that attitude, madam, was a factor

in our discussions. To a man, I must

say, they were devastated at the

prospect of not being able to

contribute to their respective

charities.

MRS. MUNSON

Well that is a shame.

DORR

Indeed. But at the end of the day,

your position prevailed, and the men

have decided that we shall return

the money -- every last cent of it! --

and attend Sunday services, rather

than spend the remainder of our years

wasting away in the Mississippi Men's

Correctional Facility. Though that

was the original preference of some.

MRS. MUNSON

Well I'm glad y'all came to see the

light, anyway. I'm gonna have some

tea and go to bed.

DORR

So the money shall be returned

tomorrow at the opening of the casino

office. Enjoy your tea, madam...

DORR

...and congratulations on having

recalled to the fold five poor,

confused sheep who had momentarily

strayed.

PANCAKE

They back yet?

DORR

Yes... yes, they just arrived.

PANCAKE

Good. I'll go dump these in the

hearse.

DORR

What in heaven's name...

DORR

...General!

PANCAKE

No extra share, huh...

PANCAKE

...Nnnrnf.

PANCAKE

...Oof!

PANCAKE

Mountain.

MOUNTAIN GIRL

Clark.

PANCAKE

...Nnrungh! Aaarmh... Ninnnff...

Offffflleghhll...

MOUNTAIN GIRL

IBS, dear?

WE CUT TO:

PANCAKE

Nnnnnmmmmfffgh!

DORR

"...Like those Nicean barks of yore

That gently, o'er a perfumed sea..."

LUMP

Quick! Grab Clark!

DORR

"...The weary, wayworn wanderer

bore... "

DORR

"...To his own native shore."

DORR

Excellent. I believe, at last, we

have the right man for the job.

DORR

...T'was our ate brought us to this

pass...

LUMP

What, Professor?

DORR

Our overweening pride... The old

woman is a more potent antagonist

than one had imagined...

DORR

...Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to

you to finish the job.

DORR

...The comedy must end.

LUMP

...Professor, I been doing some

thinking.

DORR

Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.

LUMP

Maybe she's right! Maybe we should

be going to church!

DORR

Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those

would be your words. Not that I don't

appreciate your giving the matter

the benefit of your thought. But

please recall, young man, our

respective functions in this

enterprise. I am a professor, the

professor as you yourself so often

say, the thinker, the "brains of the

operation," trained in fact in the

arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are

the goon, the hooligan, the dumb

brute whose actions must be directed

by a higher intelligence.

LUMP

Yeah, I know, but--

DORR

No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the

error of thinking! Now is the moment

of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you

must act!

LUMP

I can't do it, Professor! A nice old

lady like that!

DORR

Think of the riches, Lump, that you

and I alone shall divide! Recall the

dream of wealth untold that first

drew you to this enterprise!

LUMP

But--

DORR

And reflect also that if you decline

to act, forcing me to do so, then

you shall no longer have any

entitlement to the money! Your offices

shall have been nugatory!

LUMP

You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna

kill her?!

DORR

Of course! My hand would be forced!

LUMP

I can't let you do that, Professor!

A nice old lady like that!

DORR

You?! Allow? Not allow? What

presumption! You stupid boy! You

very very extremely stupid boy!

LUMP

Oh yeah?

LUMP

...Well who looks stupid now?

LUMP

...Huh?

LUMP

...No bullets?

WE CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

DORR

Perhaps... it had to be thus.

DORR

"...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche

How statue-like I see thee stand..."

DORR

...Hm. A raven?

DORR

"...The agate lamp within thy hand...

"

DORR

...Ah, Psyche! from the regions which

Are Holy land!"

MRS. MUNSON (O.S.)

Hmm.

MRS. MUNSON

Mm-hm.

MRS. MUNSON

Professor!

MRS. MUNSON

...Hmm. Couldn't face the music.

MRS. MUNSON

Scoot now! Outa the way!

SHERIFF WYNER

Miz Munson.

MRS. MUNSON

Sheriff, I gotta make a statement.

SHERIFF WYNER

Could it possibly wait, ma'am? We're

a little busy today.

MRS. MUNSON

I guess it can wait, but it's about

that casino money.

SHERIFF WYNER

Call you right back.

SHERIFF WYNER

...You know something about it?

MRS. MUNSON

Something? Everything! I got it at

home.

SHERIFF WYNER

You... you have what at home, now?

MRS. MUNSON

The money. Two point six million

dollars. Down in my root cellar. All

stacked up nice and neat.

SHERIFF WYNER

Mm-hmm.

DEPUTY

How'd it get there, Marva?

MRS. MUNSON

Bunch a desperate men that stole it

put it there, that's how! They was

musicians of the Renaissance period,

played the sackbutt and so on --

well, it turns out they really

couldn't play, although they could

recite poems to break your heart.

Their ringleader speaks in dead

tongues.

SHERIFF WYNER

Does he now.

MRS. MUNSON

I tried to get you to see him! That

night?

SHERIFF WYNER

Oh yes.

MRS. MUNSON

I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin'

all that money and I guess I made

'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked

up and left without takin' the money.

But I was peeved with 'em, Sheriff,

they'd been up to all sorts of

mischief, come close to blowin' up

the house, disturbed Othar no end.

SHERIFF WYNER

Angry, was he?

MRS. MUNSON

Wouldn't you be? All that racket!

SHERIFF WYNER

I expect so.

MRS. MUNSON

And they let Pickles out too!

SHERIFF WYNER

So you want us to go fetch him.

MRS. MUNSON

No, he's back, but what you want me

to do with the money?

SHERIFF WYNER

Well...

SHERIFF WYNER

...Why don't you just keep it, Miz

Munson.

MRS. MUNSON

Keep it?

DEPUTY

You keep it, Marva.

MRS. MUNSON

Well... I know it's only a penny

offa everybody's policy...

SHERIFF WYNER

How's that ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

I know folks don't much care. Could

I... You s'pose I could...

SHERIFF WYNER

Yes ma'am?

MRS. MUNSON

Could I give it all to Bob Jones

University?

SHERIFF WYNER

That'd be nice, ma'am.

MRS. MUNSON

...Well, long as everybody knows.

SHERIFF WYNER

Thank you for the information, ma'am.

MRS. MUNSON

You're welcome, sheriff. Just doin'

my duty.

MRS. MUNSON

Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure

from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean

on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting

arm.

MRS. MUNSON

...What a fellowship, What a peace

of mind, Safe and secure from all

harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus,

Leaning on the everlasting arm...

MRS. MUNSON

...Pickles!

MRS. MUNSON

...Pickles!

THE END
