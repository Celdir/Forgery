BURN AFTER READING

Written by

Joel Coen & Ethan Coen

FADE IN

High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the

earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with

clouds.

As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We

are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.

Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of

a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling

building. Computer type quickly bleeps on:

C.I.A. Headquarters

Langley, Virginia

We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of

someone walking down the well polished hallway.

We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind

his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer

DeBakey Smith.

PALMER

Ozzie.    Sit down.

Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped

shirt and bow tie.

OSBOURNE

Palmer.   What's up.

PALMER

You know Peck, and Olson.

The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at

Osbourne, who is surprised to see them.

OSBOURNE

Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by

reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox.

OLSON

Yeah, hiyah.

2.

OSBOURNE

Aren't you with...aren't you,

uh...

PALMER

Yeah, that's right. Oz, look.

There's no easy way to say this.

We're taking you off the Balkans desk.

OSBOURNE

You're----what? Why?

PALMER

In fact we're moving you out of Sigint

entirely.

OSBOURNE

...What?    No discussion, just----you're

out?

PALMER

Well, we're having the discussion now

Oz. This doesn't have to be

unpleasant.

OSBOURNE

Palmer, with all due respect----what the

fuck are you talking about?

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... And why is Olson here?

PALMER

... Look, Ozzie----

OSBOURNE

What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I

know it's not my work.

PALMER

Ozzie----

OSBOURNE

I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it----

PALMER

Oz, things are not going well.      As you

know.

3.

PECK

You have a drinking problem.

OSBOURNE

I have a drinking problem.

PALMER

This doesn't have to be unpleasant.

We found you something in State. It's

a, uh...

PALMER (CONT'D)

... It's a lower clearance level.

Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're

not terminating you.

OSBOURNE

(quietly)

This is an assault.

PECK

Come on, Ozzie.

OSBOURNE

This is an assault. I have a drinking

problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a

Mormon!

PECK

Ozzie----

OSBOURNE

Next to you we all have a drinking

problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass

didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!

PALMER

Okay, Olson----

OSBOURNE

Let's be fucking honest...

4.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... This is a crucifixion! This is

political! Don't tell me it's not!

He storms out the door.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I have a drinking problem!

The door slams.   Palmer Smith looks at Olson.     Olson arches

an eyebrow.

OSBOURNE

Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter.

His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear

the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray.

Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an

attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of

the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.

KATIE

You're home.

Osbourne continues making himself a drink.

OSBOURNE

Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have

some news. I----

KATIE

Did you pick up the cheeses?

OSBOURNE

Huh?

KATIE

Were they ready? I didn't know you

were coming home this early.

OSBOURNE

(blank)

The cheeses.

Katie rolls her eyes.

5.

KATIE

I left a message for you to stop at

Todaro's. The Magruders and the

Pfarrers are coming over.

OSBOURNE

The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did

Kathleen say?

KATIE

What?

OSBOURNE

When you left the message?

KATIE

She said.    She would give you.   The

message.

OSBOURNE

Well she, I don't know, I guess we had

bigger news today. My day didn't

revolve arou----

KATIE

So you didn't get the cheeses.

OSBOURNE

Well, since I didn't get the message,

no, I didn't get the cheeses. But

hang on to your hat, I----

KATIE

Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I

have to go out again? All right,

well, you better get dressed.

OSBOURNE

Honey, we have to talk.

KATIE

Not right now. They'll be here in,

what, less than an hour.

A hand hovers, hesitates.

VOICE

Is this a, uh, goat cheese?

OSBOURNE (OFF)

Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.

Pink Revision 8/14/07 6.

HARRY

Because I have lactose reflux.    But I

can----

OSBOURNE

You're lactose intolerant?

HARRY

Yes, but I can----

OSBOURNE

Or you have acid reflux?    They're two

different things.

HARRY

I know what they are.

OSBOURNE

Then you misspoke yourself.    So I----

HARRY

Thank you for correcting me.

KATIE

You should try the chevre, Harry.

It's very good.

HARRY

Yeah.   I can eat goat cheese.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I was just explaining to your

husband here, I have a condition----

KATIE

Harry works with the Marshalls'                       *

Service.                                              *

HARRY                                       *

Used to work for Treasury, but I                      *

I'm with the Marshalls.                               *

OSBOURNE

If you want he'll show you his great

big gun.

HARRY

Very amusing. The gun is actually no

big deal. Twenty years in the

marshall's service and I've never

discharged my weapon.

OSBOURNE

Sounds like something you should be

telling your psychiatrist.

HARRY

What?   I don't have a psychiatrist.

DOUG MAGRUDER

Boy, I guess my job is pretty

undramatic. I'm on the legislative

side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do

you also carry a gun?

HARRY

Sandy writes children's books.

SANDY

I write children's books----

HARRY

Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----

HARRY (CONT'D)

...Who Lives In The Rotunda.     Excuse

me.

TINA

Those are wonderful!    My nieces and

nephews----

8.

HARRY

Yeah, it's a beloved series. You

wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh.

Are you sure this is goat cheese?

KATIE

Why don't you let your wife tell them

about her own books, Harry?

HARRY

I'm sorry----was I----

KATIE

Here, come in the kitchen, help me

with the crudites.

They enter.

HARRY

Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he.

He looks down at the floor.        He stamps.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Nice floors.

KATIE

Knows what?

Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures.

Absently:

HARRY

About us, he knows about us.          Little

prick.

KATIE

Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a

thing.

Harry is staring down at the linoleum again.

HARRY

What is that, forbo?

A car drives by.

9.

Harry driving, his wife next to him.

A long beat.

Finally:

HARRY

What a horse's ass.

SANDY

I don't know why we see them.

Harry shrugs.

HARRY

Well, she's all right.

SANDY

She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.

Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't.

They drive.

KATIE

She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold

cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.

KATIE

You quit?!

Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top.

OSBOURNE

Uh-huh.

KATIE

Well----Thank you for letting me know!

OSBOURNE

I tried to tell you this afternoon.

KATIE

You tried? You tried? And then----

what, the aphasia kicked in?

OSBOURNE

Our guests came. We----

10.

KATIE

OSBOURNE

KATIE

OSBOURNE

KATIE

KATIE

KATIE

OSBOURNE

KATIE

11.

OSBOURNE

I've been thinking about it.    A book,

a sort of, sort of memoir.

Katie stares at him in the mirror.

A beat.

She bursts into laughter.

THE BRIDGE

A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in

his face, as the boat sails under motor power.

After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.

An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the

wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a

tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.

OSBOURNE

You okay there, Dad?

The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to

him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the

man's knees.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Dad, I left my job at the

Agency...

The old man stares out into the wind.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,

government service is not what it was

when you were in State. Things are

different now. I don't know, maybe

it's... it's... the Cold War ending;

now it seems like it's all bureaucracy

and no mission...

The old man stares out into the wind.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I'm writing a memoir. I think

it's going to be pretty explosive.

But I don't think you'll disapprove.

I don't think you'll disapprove.

Katie has had trouble accepting it.

(MORE)

12.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

But... sometimes there's a higher

patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,

change is hard. It's hard on Katie.

But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.

Life is change. This is good. We

were all blocked up, Katie and me.

This is, this is a blessing in

disguise. I'll go into training, you

know. Lay off the sauce. Like you

did. You managed to do it. Finally.

And then I can concentrate on, you

know. New beginning. And this'll all

have been for the best. Don't you

think Dad?

The old man stares out into the wind.

Osbourne sniffles.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Cold.

He taps the old man on the knee and rises.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I guess we should head back.

LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR

The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is

pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from

the boat.

A MAN'S VOICE

We've seen this...

THE MAN

White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-

book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,

suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is

Bogus Terikhian.

TERIKHIAN

... I know this kind of man.    We've

seen this.

13.

TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)

... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man

take advantage of you. And he will.

He will.

KATIE

Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----

he says----he's trying to pull himself

together, but...

TERIKHIAN

Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you

you should try to salvage things. And

you should. People turn themselves

around. Not unheard-of. But. You----

you haven't broached the possibility

of divorce yet?

KATIE

No.

TERIKHIAN

Well that's good.   Because first you

should get all his financials. Before

he's forewarned. Because here's a

man, here's a man, practiced in

deceit, this is almost, you could say

it's his job, practiced at hiding

things, and there is no reason, it is

not improper, there is no reason for

you not to get a picture of the

household finances. Paper files,

computer files, whatever----this is your

prerogative. You can be a spy too,

madam. Do this before you put him on

alert. Before the turtle can draw in

his head and his, uh...

TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)

... Feet.

TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)

... And hopefully everything will work

out. He will reform. But! If not:

forewarned is forearmed.

14.

Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over

pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-

flung, like Marat in his bathtub.

A long still beat.   A clock ticks.

Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a

microcassette recorder.

OSBOURNE

We were young and committed and there

was nothing we couldn't do. We

thought of the Agency less as... less

as...

The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and

wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.

He suddenly raises the microcassette again.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... The principles of George Kennan----a

personal hero of mine----were what

animated us. In fact they were what

had originally inspired me to enter

government service. Like the State

Department's China Hands of yore, or,

in a different forum, in a different

venue, in a different medium, in,

um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in

a different----

He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.

Faintly, a ringing phone.

At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted

stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that

juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.

The phone is louder here.

A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low

dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The

ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The

answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:

15.

MACHINE

You have reached The Cox Group...

Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered

feet toward the phone.

MACHINE (CONT'D)

... We can't answer your call right

now. Please leave a----

OSBOURNE

(heavy breathing)

Hello.

He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.    A

listening beat.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her

number... No, upstairs...No she's not,

but leave it on her machine.

We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his

robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime

game show.

A few beats of the show.

Roaring laughter from the studio audience.     Mild chuckle from

Osbourne in the foreground.

Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette

recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and

then stops, and looks off.

The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate

clock face Two or three minutes to five.

Osbourne stares for a long beat.

OSBOURNE

Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.

He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.

16.

He pauses for a long beat.

He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.

He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.

He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He

conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:

OSBOURNE

Single...

He dumps the shot into the Coke.

As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is

seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.

Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the

boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of

a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:

Minutes later. We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we

hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens. Harry

Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.

In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just

finishing dressing.

Harry looks at his watch.

HARRY

I should try to get a run in.

Katie is letting herself in.

KATIE

Ozzie!

Quiet.

Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by

a plate of used lime wedges:

17.

Honey,

At Fenninger's.     Reunion committee

dinner.

See you later.

Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is

jogging in his Treasury sweats.

Closer on him.   Brow furrows.   He spins, jogs backwards,

looking.

His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no

pedestrians particularly close.

Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.    He turns again.

Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.

Harry starts jogging again.

We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie

sits. She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into

Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.

Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still,

listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes

typing.

We hear male voices beginning to swell in song. The voices

continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:

A musty steakhouse. On the walls are hunting-scene prints

and steel engravings of English country houses.

A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room:

CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY.

From inside the room, male voices:

VOICES

Tune every heart and every voice...

18.

A dozen middle-aged men around a long table, each holding

high a glass.

MEN

... Bid every care withdraw.    Let all

with one accord rejoice...

The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy.

MEN (CONT'D)

... In praise of Old Nassau...

Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his

glass to brimming. The two sway unsteadily with the music..

MEN (CONT'D)

... In praise of Old Nassau my boys,

Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!

All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm:

MEN (CONT'D)

... Her sons... shall give... while

they... shall live...

Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish:

MEN (CONT'D)

... In praise of Old Nassau!

A WOMAN'S ASS

Bare.   Pale.   Middle-aged.

Someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:

DOCTOR (OFF)

We take all the chicken fat off your

buttocks, here... and here... And the

upper arms. And a little off your

tummy...

The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged

woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the

examining room, facing her. He reaches forward again with

the marker.

19.

DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)

...And we do breast augmentation with

a tiny incision here... and here.

PATIENT (OFF)

Uh-huh.    And what about the thigh

area?

DOCTOR

Well we can do liposuction there as

well, but that area will respond to

exercise. Buttocks and upper arms

begin to store more fat when you get

up around forty, the body just tells

it to go there, but the thighs will

respond to toning exercises.

PATIENT

Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my

arms til the cows come home, but...

DOCTOR

Uh-huh. And of course there are also

genetic factors.

PATIENT

The Litzkes are big.

DOCTOR

Uh-huh, well everything's----

PATIENT

My mom had an ass that could pull a

bus.

DOCTOR

Wow.    Well that's a predispo----

PATIENT

Father's side too, although Dad tends

to carry his weight in front of him.

DOCTOR

Uh-huh.

PATIENT

In the gut area. Derriere, not so

much.

DOCTOR

Okay.

20.

LINDA

And what about the face, you know, the

window to the soul.

DOCTOR

Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well

your eyes are one of your best

features. But we can do something

about the incipient crow's feet.

LINDA

Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's

feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie

chickie.

DOCTOR

Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have

a way with words. We cut here...

He marks.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

... And we pull the skin tight, like

stretching the skin over a drum. Not

too tight, though. We don't want that

"worked-on" look. You need sufficient

slack for the face to remain

expressive.

LINDA

Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris

Karloff.

DOCTOR

Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a

sex change!

LINDA

No, I'm all woman!

Doctor and patient, now dressed, sit on either side of a

desk.

DOCTOR

So Linda, what we're talking about

here is four different procedures.

(ticks them off)

The liposuction... The rhinoplasty...

The facial tuck, which I would

strongly recommend over the chemical

peel----

21.

LINDA

Yeah, I don't want to get anything

burned off.

DOCTOR

And why should you. With that lovely

skin. And lastly, the breast

augmentation. Now we can also do

something about the vaccine scar----I

don't know if you wear sleeveless

dresses much----

LINDA

Not with these ham hocks!

DOCTOR

Yes, well once they're nice and

svelte, post-op, you----

LINDA

Well I don't know. Is the vaccine

thing----can you counsel me on this? I

don't know, is it unsightly? I see it

a lot, a bunch of people have it.

DOCTOR

Absolutely! Some women don't mind it

at all! Personal taste!

Linda Litzke, in a Hardbodies polo shirt with "Linda"

stitched on the breast, leans out of her semi-enclosed office

on the gym floor.

LINDA

Chad!

Chad Feldheimer, trainer, fortyish and well-muscled, has a

gym patron up on a table and is helping him stretch a leg

back.

PATRON

Ow!

CHAD

I'm sorry, was that too much?

22.

PATRON

I felt a straining... a tightness in

the... in the front of my ass...

CHAD

Well you're pretty tight.     You have to

feel it or----

LINDA

(on the public address)

Chad Feldheimer. Office.

CHAD

I'll be back in a minute.     We'll work

on opening those hips.

Linda is tapping at her computer as Chad enters.

LINDA

I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.

Chad perches on the desk, chewing gum as he gazes at the

screen.

CHAD

Oh wow.   Any good?

LINDA

I don't know yet, just looking... How

do you open this?

CHAD

Click on, uh... yeah...

LINDA

Oh my god!

CHAD

What?

LINDA

Oh my God, what a loser!

She clicks.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Loser!

She clicks.   Chad is laughing.   Linda scowls.

23.

LINDA (CONT'D)

CHAD

LINDA

CHAD

LINDA

CHAD

24.

Linda slaps his arm.

CHAD (CONT'D)

... Huh-huh-huh. What does he do?

LINDA

State Department.

CHAD

That's cool.

LINDA

His hair is... what is that?

CHAD

Plugs.

Linda is showing someone around the floor.

LINDA

This is the cardio area. A lot of

machines here so that, believe me,

there's never a wait. What you're

seeing now, this is our busiest time,

and there's still a couple of open

treadmills I see, three Stairmasters----

I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of

LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.

Chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman.

CHAD

Hi Linda.     Did you call that guy?

LINDA

Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers.

I've just started internet dating and

I got my first look at the, uh...

CUSTOMER

What service?

LINDA

BeWithMeDC dot com?

CUSTOMER

Nice.

LINDA

Have you used them?

25.

CUSTOMER

No----two friends did and they're both

hooked up. With really special guys.

LINDA

That's fantastic.

Linda is leaning forward at her desk, phone wedged between

ear and shoulder, one hand up at her forehead.

After a long still beat:

LINDA

Yes!

Another still beat.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... English!

Beat.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Agent!

Beat.

LINDA DRIVING

... Agent!     Agent!

Beat.

LINDA

... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke,

should I give you my account number?

You have it up? Okay. I was informed

that I needed pre-approval for these

surgeries, and then... Yes, it was

denied.

Listening, then:

LINDA (CONT'D)

...No, those are four different

operations... It's very complicated;

I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole

new look so it isn't just one thing,

however, it's all approved by my

doctor... But----madam! This is not----my

job involves, you know, public

interface! This is not...

26.

Her jaw sets.   She controls her fury.   Quieter:

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Yes I do understand. Could I

speak to your supervisor please?

We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles

over, of Linda, now slumped at her desk, head in her arms.

We faintly hear her sobbing.

Reverse shows Ted Treffon, middle-aged, balding, the soulful

manager of Hardbodies. He looks at Linda, puzzled and a

little alarmed. He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and

hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude.

Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.

Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old

woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a

newspaper.

She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from

the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped

glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs.

LINDA

Alan?

MAN (ALAN)

Are you, uh... Linda?

A poster advertises Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and

Claire Danes.

On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes

his head to look steeply up and off.

Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously

watching the screen.

27.

DERMOT (OFF)

First you tell me that you can't

commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN

FROM THERE!

Linda laughs raucously, then catches herself and looks at

Alan.

The couple sit across from each other at a small table. They

pick at their food.

The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly

comforter. Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes

asthmatically.

Alan is snoring. After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on

a robe. She bends down near the bed and picks something up

out of Alan's trousers.

She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and

opens Alan's wallet. A Discover card, driver's license, a

condom. A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish.

She unfolds a piece of notepaper.    Written in a feminine hand

in pencil:

Please pick up:

Plunge

Honey Nut Cheerios.

LINDA

Oh for Pete's sake!

She catches herself, looks around.

The snoring, off, continues.

She looks out the window.

The lights of the freeway twinkle.

28.

We are in the bedroom.   The boat rides gently at anchor.

Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.   Both stare at a point

in space.

After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of

water against hull:

HARRY

... and then, you know, you grow up.

I guess that's what's happened with

me. You just... people change. We

married when I was, what, in my mid-

twenties. A kid. We were kids.

Twenties. You think it's forever.

Then, you know, you're older----you

begin to feel your mortality, you

start to think, well, there's no more

time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You

go, I'm not that person. The choices

you made, you can't, just through

inertia----

KATIE

I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.

Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.   After

more sloshing:

HARRY

... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean,

frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I

guess that's what I should be thinking

about too. With Sandy.

KATIE

That's what you were just saying.

HARRY

Yes! Absolutely! And you should be

getting rid of that bozo.  No

question about that. I agree.

KATIE

So if I were divorced----

HARRY

Well yes, if you were uh, you know,

yes. Yes, I should settle things.

With Sandy. Because of you and me.

It just takes, courage, you know. To

inflict that pain. Scary stuff.

(MORE)

29.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Scary stuff. You're a brave lady.

Well, of course, it would be easier

for you.

KATIE

Why's that? I don't see that.

HARRY

(chuckling)

Well you know, because he's such a

dope.

(sobers)

But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A

very special lady.

KATIE

She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

HARRY

Well that's... a little----

KATIE

You and I should sort things out.

I've told you that this is not just

frivolity.

HARRY

No, that's understood.   You've been

very straight.

KATIE

I thought I was loud and clear.

HARRY

Absolutely. Not just fun and games.

Awkward beat.   The sloshing of waves.   Harry nods.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Absolutely.

Harry Pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf.

He sights down it, examines the gauge, hefts it.

He slides it back in and pulls a length, wider gauge, from

the shelf below.

30.

Long lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry is pushing

a red shopping cart through the parking lot. Standing in the

cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one

hand as he pushes.

Linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed

to one ear.

LINDA

English!... Agent!... Agent!...

After a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and

cradles the handset. From the speaker we hear:

RECORDED VOICE

----important to us. Please stay on the

line for the next available agent.

Music.

Linda listens for a moment, then abruptly lifts the handset

and slams it back down.

TRACKING IN ON TED'S CUBICLE

Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, stands with

one hand on the back of his chair----which Chad occupies----and

one hand on the desktop, looking over Chad's shoulder at a

computer screen that Chad is scrolling down. Standing behind

both men is a short Mexican Indian man, also in a Hardbodies

uniform.

CHAD

Holy shit...

LINDA

Ted, can I talk to you about our

Mickey Mouse health plan?

Ted continues to stare at the computer screen in mounting

alarm. He responds absently to Linda:

TED

Uh-huh... Hang on...

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 31.

CHAD

This is some heavy shit.

LINDA

Is that my date list?

CHAD

No... fuck...

LINDA

You know, I'm trying to reinvent

myself, and these procedures, which

are so incredibly not cheap, this

Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not,

they're... What is this?

CHAD

I can't believe this... This is

like... intelligence shit.

TED

I am not comfortable with this.

LINDA

What is it?

CHAD

This is, like, I can't believe this

shit I'm seeing.

TED

Manolo found it.

CHAD

Manolo found this, like, CD just lying

in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies'

locker room.

MANOLO

Jus lie-een there.

CHAD

And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or

what, so I come in here and it's these

files, man.

TED

I am not comfortable with this.                       *

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 32.

CHAD

Like it's talking about SigInt, and

signals and shit. Which, Signals

means code, you know.

MANOLO

It was jus lie-een there.

CHAD

Talking about like, section heads

here, and their names and shit. And

then these other files are just, like,

numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates

and numbers... And numbers. I think                  *

that's the shit, man. The raw

intelligence.

TED

I am not touching this.    I want this

out of here.

CHAD

Wul... Throw it out?

LINDA

You can't do that! You should put a

note up in the ladies' locker room.

CHAD

Put a note up? Highly classified shit

found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA

shit? Hello! Did you lose your

secret CIA shit? I don't think so.

TED

Look, you figure it out, I am not

comfortable with this. I want this                   *

out of Hardbodies...

TED (CONT'D)

... We're running a gym here!

CHAD

Look,   Manolo...

CHAD (CONT'D)

...you didn't find this.

MANOLO

I found it on the floor there.

CHAD

Yeah, I know, but

MANOLO

Right there on the floor there.      Lie-

een there.

CLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR

A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a

quiet Chevy Chase street.

Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we

see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of

the back seat of the station wagon.

Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the

driveway of the suburban house.

Harry is struggling through the      front door with the length

of pipe.

We hear his wife call down from upstairs:

SANDY

Harry?      Is that you?

HARRY

Yeah, yeah, it's me.

He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar,

sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door

behind him.

Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a

short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise.

His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement.

There is also haphazard storage.

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 34.

One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker:

"Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver,"

"Point of Order, Oliver!"

Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware.

He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of

pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally

slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly

back and forth, nicely balanced.

Linda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of

Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's.

To a waitress:

LINDA

Absolut Saketini, please?

TED

Just a Tab.

LINDA

You know, it wouldn't cover all of it,

but if I got some advance on my salary

I could at least get the surgery ball

rolling.

TED

Whoa! There's a payroll company, you

know. They don't just advance people

money. They just don't do that. I

mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I                           *

authorize it, but that's not going to

mean anything to them.

LINDA

Well why do they have us on a

cockamamie health plan? I need these

surgeries, Ted!

TED

You're a beautiful woman!   You don't

need

LINDA

Ted, I have gone just as far as I can

go with this body! I----

TED

I think it's a very beautiful----it's

not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body----

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 35.

LINDA

That's right, Ted, I would be laughed

out of Hollywood. I have very limited

breasts and a gi-normous ass and I

have this gut that swings back and

forth in front a me like a shopping

cart with a bent wheel.

TED

Oh come on!

LINDA

I am trying to get back in

circulation. I have appetites and so

forth, and, uh----

TED

Well there's a lot of guys who'd like

you just the way you are.

LINDA

Yeah----losers!

TED

Well, I don't know. Am I a loser?

Lemme tell you something. I wasn't

always a manager at Hardbodies. I,

um...

*

TED (CONT'D)                                  *

Let me show you something.

LINDA

Omygod----is that you?!

TED

Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox

priest. Congregation in Chevy Chase.

36.

LINDA

Well jeez, that's a good job!

TED

Mm-hm.

LINDA

What happened?

TED

Well...

TED (CONT'D)

... It's a long story. Anyway, lotta

ways I'm happier now. My point is...

my point is... it's a journey.

LINDA

Well that's my point! I don't want to

stay where I am! I want to find

someone to share my journey!

TED

Well, sometimes, you know, you don't

look in your own back yard, you're

never gonna see----

LINDA

That's right! That's why I've started

this internet dating!

TED

Uh-huh, but I'm saying, maybe you

don't have to, you know... to----

LINDA

Look Ted, I know you can't authorize

an advance on my salary but you can

put in a request, can't you?

TED

It's not going to do any good, Linda.

LINDA

Ted, have you ever heard of the power

of positive thinking?

37.

It is night. Linda sleeps in a darkened bedroom under the

frilly comforter.   We hear a distant banging. Finally the

banging stops and a moment later the telephone rings.

Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

LINDA

Hurrow----

She removes an appliance from her mouth.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Hello?... Where are you?... Okay.

Just a second.

We hear a door being buzzed open. At the top of the staircase

an apartment door opens and Linda appears in a robe.

Her POV down the steep staircase: Chad Feldheimer is walking

up towards the landing dressed in a black lycra bicycle

unitard with lime green flames. He holds a bike wheel in one

hand and a plastic squirt bottle in the other.

He looks up, foreshortened.

CHAD

Omygod.

Chad enters with his bicycle wheel and squirt bottle.   Linda

shuts the door behind him.

CHAD

Omygod.

LINDA

Chad, you know what time it is?

CHAD

Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you

this on your totally unsecure phone,

but I know who the guy is.

He leans his wheel against the wall and sits on a low chair

that brings his knees up near his chin. He looks smugly at

Linda.

38.

LINDA

The guy?

CHAD

The guy, the secret guy.

LINDA

Is he high up?

CHAD

Um. I don't know if he's high up.

Probably. I mean, I know his name,

not like his rank.

LINDA

What is it?

CHAD

Osbourne.    Cox.

LINDA

Never heard of him.

CHAD

Oh, like you're so plugged in to the

intelligence community.

LINDA

I'm just saying, to the layman----

CHAD

Well I think like the quality of the

intelligence dictates how high up he

is.

LINDA

Uh-huh.

CHAD

Not what we know.

LINDA

Uh-huh.

CHAD

And I also got his----do you have any

water? I gotta hydrate.

LINDA

I have tap water

39.

CHAD

Are you kidding?

LINDA

How did you find out who he is?

CHAD

Sources.

LINDA

What do you mean sources?

CHAD

Do you have like Gatorade? Anything

besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

CHAD (CONT'D)

... You know how far this is from my

place?

LINDA

How do you know his name?

CHAD

I have this geek friend, Ernie

Gallegos? He does computer stuff,

hooks up people's computers and

programs their VCRs'n shit? So he

examines the files and he pulls off

the digital watermark that tells what

computer they were created on.

Fucking child's play for Ernie.

LINDA

Uh-huh.

CHAD

I also have his telephone number.

That was a little harder.

LINDA

Omygod!

CHAD

Shall we give him a tinkle?

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 40.

LINDA

Omygod, why?

CHAD

Because he's gonna wanna know that his

shit is secure. You know, he's gonna

be relieved. He might even be so

relieved he gives us a reward----I would

be very fucking surprised if he did

not.

LINDA

Oh, wow.

CHAD

Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            *

Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even

a tax, really, since it's voluntary.

Chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching

numbers into a wall phone. In the background we see Linda

watching him from the living room couch.

A beat.

We hear the call ring through.

The click of the connection being made, and Chad silently

gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick

up her extension.

CHAD

Hello?

He has the phone pressed groggily to his ear.

OSBOURNE

Hello?

CHAD

Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox?

OSBOURNE

Yes----uh----Who is this?

CHAD

Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox?

41.

OSBOURNE

Who is this? What time is it?     Who

are you?

CHAD

I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm

calling at such an hour, but I thought

you might be worried.

OSBOURNE

Worried?

CHAD

About the security.     Of your shit.

OSBOURNE

What on earth are you talking about?

Who am I speaking to?

KATIE

Who is it?

CHAD

Your files----your documents. I know

these documents are sensitive. But I

am perfectly happy to return to you

your sensitive shit. At a time of

your choosing.

OSBOURNE

What documents? What are you talking

about?

CHAD

... Osbourne Cox?

OSBOURNE

(explosive)

Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!     Who the

fuck

CHAD

Settle down, Osbourne.

KATIE

Who is that?

OSBOURNE

What documents are you talking about?

CHAD

You know, this is a major

inconvenience for us and we thought,

you know, a reward----

OSBOURNE

So it's money! So it's money!

CHAD

Well, yeah, uh... why not? I mean,

this is not----am I out of line here?

OSBOURNE

All right, you two clowns listen to me

very very carefully. I don't know who

you are, but I warn you most

emphatically----

LINDA

You warn us? You warn us? You know

what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence? We warn

you! We'll call you back with our

demands!

CHAD

Hello?   We just----

OSBOURNE

Who, who----

LINDA

Chad!    Don't play his game!

OSBOURNE

Hello!   Hello!

CHAD

(into the phone as he

hangs it up)

Sorry.

CHAD (CONT'D)

... Geeze...

LINDA

The nerve of that guy!

CHAD

... I am very fucking surprised he did

not give us the reward.

44.

Osbourne sits on the edge of his bed in the dark room,

shaking his head.

KATIE

What in God's name is going on?

OSBOURNE

There's some clown----a couple of clowns

----somehow got a hold of my memoir----

KATIE

Your what?

OSBOURNE

Stole it or----I have no idea how they

got it----

KATIE

Your what?

OSBOURNE

My memoir, the book   I'm writing.

KATIE

Why in God's name would they think

that's worth anything.

OSBOURNE

Well they----I... I've no idea how they

got it.

Chad paces, shaking his head.

CHAD

But it doesn't sound like he's gonna

play ball.

LINDA

Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to

let him know who's boss.

CHAD

Well, that's----he sounds very senior.

I think this is some senior guy who

has screwed the pooch, big-time.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 45.

LINDA

Yeah, that's why we got him, you know,

we've caught him with his thing caught

in a big fat wringer.

CHAD

Yuh-huh.

LINDA

And us in the driver's seat. This is

our opportunity, like, you don't get

many of these. You slip on the ice

outside of, you know, a fancy

restaurant.

CHAD

Yuh-huh.

LINDA

Or this happens.

CHAD

Right.

LINDA

And right now this has happened.

CHAD

Yup.   It sure has.

LINDA

This could put a big dent in my

surgeries.

CHAD

Big time.

SANDY PFARRER

We are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand

on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw:

SANDY

Honey!

No answer.    The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel.

Louder:

SANDY (CONT'D)

Honey!

Blue Revision 8/1/07 46.

The whine hums down.

HARRY'S VOICE

Huh?

SANDY

My cab is here, I'm off.      Mystery man.

Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the

angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower

body as he throws a drape over his project. He emerges from

the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it.

SANDY (CONT'D)

... What is that thing?

HARRY

Oh baby.     Top secret.

He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... You're gonna knock 'em dead.

At the top of the stairs he kisses her.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... How many cities?

SANDY

Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

Chicago.

He picks up her bag and they go out.

HARRY

Why do they always have you do

Seattle. Not a big market.

SANDY

I don't know, lots of independent

bookstores. Rains all day, what are

people gonna do.

HARRY

I can think of a couple of things.

SANDY

You can think of one thing.

They are walking to a black Town Car idling curbside.

Pink Revision 8/14/07 47.

SANDY

It better be the Peninsula. The money

I make for them. Are you gonna be

okay?

HARRY

I'll be sad. But I'll be okay.

SANDY

Not too sad..

HARRY

Just the right amount.

He kisses her.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I am crazy about you, baby.

He slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his

look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught

on:

A Ford Taurus, parked, dark.

Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards

the parked car.

When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the

car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost

when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the

curb into a U-turn and drives away.

Harry watches the tail lights recede.

CLOSE ON A THUMB AND FINGER

Twisting a gold cufflink like a worry bead. Wider shows the

attorney Bogus Terikhian at a conference table in a book-

lined room.

He leans forward and presses a button on his phone console.

BOGUS (CONT'D)

... Connie, could you bring in your

copy of the Cox financials?

The secretary rummages through a gym bag that has the

Hardbodies logo. There are gym clothes among the odds and

ends. She picks up her handset.

SECRETARY

I thought I had it here on a disk----I

don't know where the disk is. I'm

sorry, I'll have to run another off my

hard drive.

Bogus is leaning back, expansive.

BOGUS

Tony sang "The Best Is Yet To Come."                        *

Yeah, okay.

BACK TO KATIE:

BOGUS (CONT'D)

So. We've drawn up the papers and are

prepared to execute service on

Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

Our missiles are pointed at his

capital, so to speak, and we await

only your word. But, be mindful,

madam: once these missiles are

launched, there is no recalling them.

We are not picking daisies. We are

declaring war, and hostilities will

then impose their own logic. I think

you understand what I'm saying.

KATIE

It'll piss Ozzie off.

BOGUS

Mm-hm.

49.

KATIE

Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband

second chances galore. There are

limits to my charity.

BOGUS

Of course. But since we are at the

point of no return, I always urge my

clients at this juncture to give it

one more day of reflection.

KATIE

Yes.   Understood.

Linda walks down the promenade, dressed in a smart pant suit.

Her moving POV passes over people relaxing in the park: a

mother with a stroller, kids running with a ball. Her look

settles on the bench that formerly held her first date, now

occupied by:

A man spitting sunflower seeds.   Harry Pfarrer.

The point-of-view arcs past him as Linda gives him the once-

over.

She doubles back.

LINDA

Harry?    I'm Linda.

Harry and Linda eat with appetite as they talk.

HARRY

Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing

for years. My guy was in State, the

Secretary in fact, so of course I

traveled a lot.

Harry talks into his sleeve-cuff as if into a radio

transmitter:

..."Ironside is leaving the building."

We called him Iron Ass.

Linda cackles.

No way!

Linda swings the door open, leading Harry in.

Harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment.

HARRY

----but there was just a hell of a lot

of political infighting, petty, petty,

shit, and then basically the old man

stepped on Goldberger's throat.

Nice...

He is evaluating the place.   He stamps on the floor.

I guess.

Harry is taking off his coat.

HARRY

Listen, full disclosure here Linda...

He holds up both hands and waggles the fingers.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but

I am married. Took the ring off,

what, eighteen months ago when we

agreed to separate. Agreed to

disagree. That's about the only thing

Linda cackles.

LINDA

Thanks for telling me.     I really do

appreciate it, Harry.

HARRY

Well, full transparency, the only way

to----

As Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.    Linda reacts to

his gun in the shoulder holster:

LINDA

That's not gonna go off, is it?

HARRY

Well let's go in the other room and

find out!   Grrr!

TED TREFFON

LINDA

He's very very communicative. Very

accessible. He has a sense of humor.

about my surgeries.

internet----

LINDA

Yeah, so am I!

A rattling knock.   Linda looks over:

Chad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on

the cubicle window. He gestures urgently for her to come

out.

Behind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health

club through a heavy back door.

LINDA

No, you can't go like that!     You gotta

wear a suit.

CHAD

Well----you mean----go home and change?

LINDA

Yeah!

CHAD

I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have

time?

Harry and Katie are at a downtown D.C. restaurant in the

middle of lunch.

KATIE

----which to my mind is all the more

reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

HARRY

Mm.

KATIE

That's it?     "Mm"?

HARRY

I'm just... wondering if it's the

right time.

54.

KATIE

Of course it's the right time.   Why

wouldn't it be the right time.   Does

it threaten you?

HARRY

No no. No, you and me are rock solid.

That's why I, uh, I think we can

afford to be big. We can think about

Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him

get himself together a little before

you hammer him with, um----

KATIE

Is that how you see me, "hammering"

him?

HARRY

Of course not, but----

KATIE

Weren't those your words?

HARRY

Yes, but----

KATIE

I don't "hammer."

HARRY

No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm

saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You

know that. I think he's an arrogant

little geek. But for Christ sakes,

you and me have all the time in the

world, and he just lost his job----

KATIE

He didn't lose it, he quit.

HARRY

Yeah. Most of the people who "quit"

in this town were fired.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I feel sorry for the guy. And

he'll be easier to deal with when he

doesn't feel... cornered.

55.

KATIE

Maybe. As long as we're talking about

Ozzie and not you.

HARRY

Of course we're talking about Ozzie.

Baby, I stand by you whatever you do.

I adore you.

She nods, thinking, still gazing at him.   Her cell phone

chirps and she reaches into her purse.

KATIE

Please get the check.

She flips open the phone.

KATIE (CONT'D)

...Yes?... Yes?... Is there blood in

his stool?...Yes, soon.

She looks at her watch, rises.

KATIE (CONT'D)

It's after two. I have to get back to

work.

Harry rises to kiss her.

HARRY

I love you so much.

CLOSE ON A WATCH

Showing 2:20.

Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a

downtown street, consulting his watch.

He looks up, irritated, and glances around.   His look is

arrested by:

The side-view mirror. It shows a man approaching on bicycle

along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet. The man

dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike

to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and

takes off his helmet. It is Chad.

He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger

door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm.

56.

CHAD

Osbourne Cox?

OSBOURNE

And you, I take it, are "Mr. Black"?

CHAD

Yes I am.    You have the money?

OSBOURNE

The fifty-thousand dollars.

CHAD

That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne

Cox.

OSBOURNE

All right. Let me explain something

to you, "Mr. Black." You know who I

am; I know who you are.

CHAD

(smug)

Perhaps. But appearances can be----

deceptive.

OSBOURNE

Yeah. What you're engaged in is

blackmail, which is a felony. That's

for starters.

CHAD

Appearances can be----deceptive.   I am a

mere Good Samar----

OSBOURNE

Secondly, the unauthorized

dissemination of classified material

is a federal crime. If you ever

carried out your proposed threat, you

would experience such a shitstorm of

consequences, my friend, it would make

your empty little head spin faster

than your Schwinn bicycle over there.

CHAD

You think that's a Schwinn?

OSBOURNE

Now give me the fucking floppy or the

CD or whatever the fuck you have it

on, and I will----

57.

CHAD

As soon as you give me the money,

dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf!

Osbourne has punched him in the nose.

Chad stares at him, stunned.

His nose starts bleeding.

CHAD (CONT'D)

... You fuck!

OSBOURNE

Give it to me, fuck!

CHAD

You fuck!     You fucker!

He opens the car door and gets out, hand to his nose.

He slams the door.

As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front

seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow:

OSBOURNE

I know who you are, fucker!

He pulls out.

CHAD

You're the fucker!

There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's.

Chad looks, surprised.    Linda is pulling up.   Her passenger

window rolls down.

LINDA

Where's the money?

CHAD

He hit me!

LINDA

Where's the money?!

CHAD

He didn't give it to me

58.

LINDA

Oh, for----Get in!

Chad does.

CHAD

That fucker!

He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it.

Recovering:

CHAD

... Hey----what're you----

Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic.

CHAD (CONT'D)

Oh shit!

The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.

He recoils from the impact.

OSBOURNE

Holy fucking----you fucking morons!

The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him.

It swerves out, screeching, to pass, and Linda angrily flips

him the finger as she speeds by.

LINDA

That'll give him something to think

about.

Chad is chuckling.      Suddenly he sobers.

CHAD

Wait, wait! We gotta go back!

Linda's jaw is set.      The car is ripping through traffic.

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 59.

LINDA

I knew this would happen.

CHAD

We gotta go back!     My bike!

LINDA

It's on to Plan B.

CHAD

It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can

open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

LINDA

Heavens sakes----

CHAD

Where we going?     My bike!

LINDA

Some people!

A skidding turn sends his weight against the door, and the

car lurches to a halt.

CHAD

... What is this?

LINDA

Russian Embassy.

CHAD'S POV THRU WINDSHIELD

The hulking embassy building.

Linda stands before a reception desk. Chad is just behind

her, his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped

back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose. His bike

helmet is clamped under his other arm.

LINDA

I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping                      *

by?

CHAD

Is there a men's room?

60.

Linda and Chad sit in, Chad with a moistened hand-towel now

pressed to his nose.

Behind the desk sits a sixtyish Russian functionary with the

beetle-browed sphynx-like look of the Brezhnev-era

bureaucrat. This is Krapotkin.

KRAPOTKIN

----Not exactly. I am assistant

cultural attache. The organs of state

security are not allowed to function

within the borders of your country.

LINDA

... The organs of state security?

KRAPOTKIN

Yes.

LINDA

But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a

highly, um, secrets that would

interest the organs of state

security...

She trails off, nodding encouragingly at Krapotkin.

Krapotkin looks blankly back.

A long beat.

KRAPOTKIN

Yes.

She rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette. She

holds it aloft, waggling it for Krapotkin.

Krapotkin stares.

Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across.

LINDA

... This is just a taste.

After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin

leans forward to take it. Linda smiles. Krapotkin turns the

diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up.

KRAPOTKIN

May I ask the source of this...

Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 61.

LINDA

No you may not.

CHAD

Very high up.

LINDA

Chad!

CHAD

I'm just saying he's high up!

KRAPOTKIN

PC or Meck?

LINDA

Um.    PC.                                              *

KRAPOTKIN

Could you wait please?

LINDA

Well----

LINDA (CONT'D)

... I have a date----

LINDA (CONT'D)                            *

The fish.      Has bitten.                              *

CHAD                                      *

What?      Oh, yeah.   Yeah, he seems cool.

CHAD (CONT'D)

... That fucker really hit me.

62.

Chad is slumped back with his head tilted back.     Linda looks

at her watch.

The door opens.     A man in a suit:

MAN

Could you accompany me please?

LINDA

Well----okay...

The three people----Linda, Chad, the man in the suit----walking.

Linda gazes around; Chad has his head mostly back.

Vladimir Putin glares down from a framed photograph on the

wall. Chad and Linda are sitting before yet another man, even

blander than the first.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

Can you tell me where this material

comes from?

Linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip.

The man looks at her impassively.

CHAD

Name, rank and serial number.

The Russian's focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose:

NEW EMBASSY MAN

Excuse me?

CHAD

We, um... we know our rights.

The man stares at him.       A beat.

LINDA

This is just a taste.

The man's look swings back to the woman for another staring

beat.

At length:

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 63.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

There is more material?

LINDA

There's a lot more.    But we need to be

paid.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

You are not ideological.

A beat.

CHAD

I don't think so.

LINDA

Look, I have a date.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

Hm?

Linda holds up her watch and taps at it:

LINDA

Date.

The man sighs.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

... We will examine the material.   How

do I contact?

LINDA

We work at the Hardbodies in

Alexandria.

CHAD

I'm at 1442 Westerly----

LINDA

Chad, not your home address!

Beat.

NEW EMBASSY MAN

So... I call Hardbodies, I ask for...

Chad?

LINDA

No.    Linda.                                             *

64.

TED TREFFON

Point-of-view from a car pulling into Hardbodies. Ted

Treffon, the soulful manager, stands on the sidewalk in front

of the gym, squinting into the approaching car, his arms out

to either side, palms up: what the hell is going on?

Minutes later.

TED

A line to check in, towels piling up.

LINDA

I'm sorry.

TED

Manolo running around like crazy----what

happened to your nose?

CHAD

I just----

TED

This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.

You two know better than that.

LINDA

Yes we do.     I'm sorry, Ted.

TED

This is no way.

CHAD

It was unavoidable.    This won't happen

again.

A considering beat.

TED

But you won't tell me what's going on.

LINDA

We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this

is terrible, but----I have to run. I

have a date.

Ted looks at her dolefully.

TED

You're changing, Linda.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 65.

He shakes his head.

TED (CONT'D)

... Very sad.

The car is parked in the driveway of the Cox townhouse, its

back crumpled.

Reverse shows Katie, looking at it, furious, her jaw set.

Katie marches in the door.

KATIE

Ozzie! Goddamnit, Ozzie, what have

you done to the car?!

Silence.

Katie enters.

KATIE

Ozzie!

Osbourne, lightly sheened by sweat, is in the easy chair in

his robe, his microcassette recorder under the hand splayed

across his chest. Amber fluid puddles a glass on the side

table. Osbourne snores softly.

Katie's fury mounts.    She visibly fights it down.

KATIE (CONT'D)

... All right. All right.

In Harry Pfarrer's house. Harry stands before the mirror

humming as he meticulously trims his eyebrow hair with a

Hoffritz scissors.

We hear his phone ringing, then the answering machine:

HARRY'S VOICE

Sandy and I aren't here to take your

call. Please leave a message.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 66.

After a beep:

KATIE'S VOICE

Can I see you please. Harry, please

call me. I'm very upset.

Harry continues to hum, trimming his eyebrows.   The machine

beeps off.

Harry walks into the living room. He takes some as-yet-

unfolded packing boxes and strews them with studied

randomness across the floor. As he does so we hear a cell

phone chirp.

Harry fishes the phone out of his pocket and holds it at

arm's length, squinting at the number. Still humming, he

stuffs the phone back in his pocket.

Linda meets Harry with a kiss.

LINDA

I'm sorry----am I late?

HARRY

No no, doesn't start for five minutes.

He is escorting to a movie theater entrance.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... You haven't seen this, have you?

LINDA

Oh!   No, no I haven't.

Our follow-move brings in a light box displaying the one-

sheet for Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and Claire

Danes.

As they tail out of frame:

HARRY

I hear it's terrific.

On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes

his head to look steeply up and off.

67.

DERMOT

First you tell me that you can't

commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN

FROM THERE!

Along with Linda, Harry laughs raucously, tossing popcorn

into his mouth.

The door swings in and Harry and Linda enter.      Harry refers

to the boxes littering the floor:

HARRY

Pardon our dust, I, uh----the ex is in

the process of moving out. Damn! I

told her I wanted to expedite this.

LINDA

Uh-huh.

HARRY

We, uh, you know you try to act like

an adult.

LINDA

Oh, it's never easy.

HARRY

Oh! Come on downstairs.    Do you like

surprises?

LINDA

Well, I'm very open to new

experiences...

The overhead light is switched on.

As Harry and Linda come down the stairs:

HARRY

I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this

in a gentleman's magazine----twelve

hundred bucks. I take a look at this

thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be

kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is

basically nothing but speed-rail, I

could probably go to Home Depot and

whip this up myself for, like, a

hundred bucks...

68.

He sweeps the drop-cloth off his project.

It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat.

Its function is obscure.

LINDA

... What is it?

HARRY

(smug)

What is it. You siddown, feet in the

stirrups, and...

He pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then

back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo

emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled

toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its

entrance.

A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo

rhythmically bobbing up and down.

At length:

LINDA

Omygod!

Another couple of cycles.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... It's fantastic!

HARRY

Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks

all-in if you don't count my labor.

And the, you know----cost of the dildo.

Those things are not cheap.

LINDA

Uh-uh.

HARRY

But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to

mold hard rubber.

Both stare at the rocking love seat:

Squeak.   Squeak.      Squeak.

69.

OSBOURNE

... The Russians?

MAN (HAL)

Uh-huh.

OSBOURNE

The Russians?

HAL

Uh-huh.    Russian Embassy, yeah.

OSBOURNE

... You're sure?

HAL

Hey, the guy was not hard to follow.

OSBOURNE

Why the FUCK would they go to the

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Why the FUCK...

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I'm sorry. Thank you, Hal.

HAL

Hey.     No problemo.

HAL (CONT'D)

... Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid

old spook, but those two guys seem

very interested in you.

70.

...You haven't gone poofy on me, have

ya Oz?

evening.

HAL

Ouch.

71.

THRU A WINDSHIELD

Night.    Rain.

The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the

front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark. A couple of

pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on

the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave

but some not.

OSBOURNE'S VOICE

What the fuck?

OUTSIDE

The car stops. Osbourne emerges, runs through the rain to

the front stoop. Rain drums against cardboard.

OSBOURNE

What the fuck?

He puts his key in the lock and----it doesn't turn.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Fucking...

He nudges a cardboard box with his toe.

He looks up at the dark house, squinting against the rain.

Linda and Chad sit at the counter, Linda drinking a large

protein shake, Chad idly twirling a straw wrapper around one

finger.

CHAD

Why did you tell him we could get more

stuff?

LINDA

Well maybe we can.

CHAD

That's all Manolo found! That was

everything! What're we, gonna tell

Manolo to scoop some more secret shit

off the locker room floor!

LINDA

CHAD

Okay.

PUBLIC ADDRESS

Chad, your Berry Blast is waiting.

LONG LENS POINT-OF-VIEW

A car is pulling into the driveway.   Katie Cox emerges from

the driver's side.

Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car

across the street.

Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a

brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he

follows Katie up the walk.

It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,

but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself

in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back

in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.

The door closes.

Chad relaxes, straightens up.   A beat.   He looks idly around.

He notices:

Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further

up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become

visible over the driver's headrest.

Chad looks, puzzled.

Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when

a noise brings his look around:

74.

The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a

change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.

They get into her car.   It pulls out.

Chad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his

door but pauses, seeing:

The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it

now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars

disappear.

Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the

townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other

side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,

smoking.

Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-

level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the

caging on the door. He looks up the facade of the house.

It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have

seen before. Harry emerges.

HARRY

What's the odometer say?

KATIE

Five.

HARRY

About five or approximately five?    I

mean----about f----

KATIE

For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five

miles. Five point two.

HARRY

Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five.

Five and a deuce is okay.

KATIE

I'm surprised you have any energy

left.

HARRY

You kiddin'----pull around the corner

we'll do it again in back!

75.

KATIE

You are very coarse.

HARRY

No, back of the car.   I didn't mean a

rear-entry, uh----

KATIE

Ach.   I'm late----

The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.

Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising.

A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a

quick glance around.

Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.

The garden steps down to a back door. Chad checks out the

windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It

has a large window.

We can see Chad's form outside the door.   Its pane is tapped

once... twice... it breaks.

HARRY JOGGING

He spins, jogs backward.

His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly.   Following?

Harry cuts across a park lawn.

Chad is nosing around the basement.   He notices Ozzie's

office set-up.

76.

HARRY

Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around

and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.

Chad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer.

He fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the

computer.

HARRY

Jogging, entering a residential area.

Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly

around, heading toward the front door when a shape

materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.

Chad freezes.

There is scraping at the lock.

Chad quickly mounts the stairs.

Chad freezes, listening.

The downstairs door swings open, shut.

Footsteps.

A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open

door.

Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the

way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.

His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.    In the middle of the

bed, a wedge-cushion.

77.

CHAD

Nuhhh!

HARRY

AHHHHHHHHHH!

78.

He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back

up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that

he can listen.

A long silence.

HARRY

... Hello?

No answer.

He looks around.

Harry enters.    He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.

Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the

stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.

HARRY

... Hello?

Harry tops the stairs.       He pauses, looking at:

The bedroom door, ajar.

Inside, his gun lies on the floor.

Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.

He pauses at the cracked door.      Suddenly:

HARRY

Hungh!

He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops

it, dropping the knife.

He stands and spins, panting.

His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude

into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his

back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.

79.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Hello?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Omygod. Omygod.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Omygod who are you. You fucker.

Omygod.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... You fucker...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Omygod, my god... Ungh...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Omygod...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... What the fuck...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Oh my fuck...

80.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I killed a fucking spook.    You

fucker...

He gazes down at the body.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... What are you doing here, you

fucker.

We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of

someone walking down the well polished hallway.

We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame

and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer

DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.

He looks up.

PALMER

Olson.    What's up.

The door slams shut.

Some time later.    Our camera position is higher.

At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out,

grim-faced.

Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway.

Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A

silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned

back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the

desktop.

MAN

Palmer.    What's up.

81.

PALMER

Not quite certain, sir, but it's...

messy.

PALMER (CONT'D)

... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have

computer files from an ex-analyst of

mine, Osbourne Cox.

GARDNER CHUBB

Kolyma-2?

PALMER

Our man in the Russian Embassy.

GARDNER CHUBB

Mm.

PALMER

It was brought to them by a woman

who----

GARDNER CHUBB

The Russians?

PALMER

Yeah. It was brought in by Linda

Litzke, an associate of a guy named

Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the

folder. With Pfarrer's.

GARDNER CHUBB

The Russians.

PALMER

Yeah.

GARDNER CHUBB

Who's Pfarrer?

PALMER

Treasury agent who's been, um,

screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they

got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows

about it, they all seem to be sleeping

with each other.

GARDNER CHUBB

All right.     Spare me.

82.

PALMER

Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's

gotten... complicated. He just shot

somebody in Ozzie's house.

GARDNER CHUBB

Shot----your analyst?

PALMER

Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying

hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy

wrestle something into his car,

follows him; he dumps a body in the

Chesapeake Bay.

GARDNER CHUBB

Well----what'd he do that for?

PALMER

Don't know sir.

GARDNER CHUBB

Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the

body out?

PALMER

Mm-hm.

GARDNER CHUBB

Russian?   American?

PALMER

Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.

GARDNER CHUBB

And this... Linda...?

PALMER

Linda Litzke.

GARDNER CHUBB

She's Treasury?

PALMER

No, we're----um... fuzzy on her.

GARDNER CHUBB

Well----so----we don't really know what

anyone is after.

83.

PALMER

Not really, sir.

GARDNER CHUBB

This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...

PALMER

Cox.

GARDNER CHUBB

Yeah.    What's his clearance level.

PALMER

Three.

GARDNER CHUBB

Okay.    Okay, no biggie...

He reaches the folder back to Palmer.

GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)

... for now just keep an eye on

everyone, see what they do.

PALMER

Right, sir. And----we'll interface with

the FBI on this, uh, dead body?

GARDNER CHUBB

No! No, we don't want those idiots

blundering around in this. Burn the

body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye

on everyone, see what they do. Report

back when, um, I don't know. When it

makes sense.

A HOPPING MAN IN A UNITARD

His hands are on his hips. He is darkly Mediterranean and

very fit. He smiles into the camera as he hops in time to

upbeat music, kicking a leg out on each beat.

MAN

To the left!... Repeat!... To the

right!... Repeat!... And in!... And

out!... And higher!... Repeat!...

Wider shows that the man is on TV leading the viewer in

exercise. The viewer, in this case, is Osbourne Cox, on his

boat.

84.

He follows along in his underwear in the cramped quarters

belowdecks. Boxes and luggage are strewn about, half-

unpacked.

He pants as he exercises:

OSBOURNE

I'm bigger... I'm back... I'm

better... I'm back... than ever... I'm

back... fuckers... I'm back...

MAN ON TV

... And good!... Repeat!... Now

bend!... And bounce!... . And

lower!... Repeat!... And up!... And

back!... And up!... Repeat!

LINDA

We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles

over, of Linda slumped at her desk, head in her arms. We

faintly hear her sobbing.

Reverse shows Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies,

looking at her, unsettled.

CLOSE ON LINDA

We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut.

A tap against the cubicle window brings her head up.

Ted Treffon opens the door.

TED

Linda.   You okay?

LINDA

I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry.

He sits at the chair alongside her desk.

TED

You don't look fine.

LINDA

No no, I'm... I'm...

TED

You won't tell me what it's about.

You never let me in, Linda.

85.

LINDA

Oh, I know you're trustworthy, I

just... don't want to endanger other

people with----I mean, it's a path I've

chosen, it's not, you have to isolate,

you know, a firewall.

TED

Uh-huh. Well, I don't know what to

think. You both go AWOL on Friday;

today Chad doesn't bother to come in

at all----

LINDA

I know, Ted.

TED

Linda, I can't run a gym this way.

LINDA

I know, Ted.

TED

I'm going to have to fire him.

LINDA

No! No no no, Ted!   Just, just. .   .

TED

What?

LINDA

Give me twenty-four hours!

TED

To what?

LINDA

To, um... I don't know, twenty-four

hours!

TED

Linda----

LINDA

Just give me twenty-four hours to

solve this thing!

TED

Linda. I have to tell you. A man was

here earlier asking about you.

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 86.

LINDA

Foreigner?

TED

Linda, are you in some kind of

trouble? Is Chad running from

something?

LINDA

Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me

ask you this: did he know my name.

TED

Whuh----yes, he was asking about you.

Employment history, et cetera. Real

jerk. I told him to get lost.

LINDA

Thank you, Ted.

TED

Well, we...

TED (CONT'D)

... we just don't give that out at

Hardbodies.

VOICE

Linda, there's a Mr. Krapotkin on line                   *

two.

LINDA

Omygod!

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Hello? Mr. Krapkin?                                  *

VOICE

Linda?

Yellow Revision 8/24/07 87.

LINDA

Yes?

VOICE

This is Ilan Krapotkin. Russian

embassy. Returning your call.

LINDA

Yes, yes!----hang on.    Ted, I'm sorry.

This is private.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Hello.     Is this a secure line, Mr.

Krapkin?                                               *

KRAPOTKIN

Heh-heh.

LINDA

Mr. Krapkin?                                           *

KRAPOTKIN

Yes?

LINDA

Is this a secure, uh----

KRAPOTKIN

You are joking?

LINDA

No! I----I'm terribly worried about my

associate. My----my----you know... Chad.

KRAPOTKIN

Yes?   Why is that?

LINDA

Do you have him?

KRAPOTKIN

Do we have him?

LINDA

Is he----I don't know what the term is,

did he, "go over"?

Blue Revision 8/1/07 88.

KRAPOTKIN

Um...

Linda glances up. Outside her cubicle window Ted waits; at

Linda's look he turns palms up: What's going on? Linda holds

up a finger: one second.

LINDA

Do you know where he is?

KRAPOTKIN

Is he not... at Hardbodies?

LINDA

No, I----look, can I come in and discuss

this?

Harry Pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots.

He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly,

producing slices in high volume.

Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen

in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she

gazes over half-glasses at Harry. His chopping continues

unabated.

After a long look and much chopping:

KATIE

You seem distracted.

HARRY

(still chopping)

Do I?

KATIE

Very distracted.      The last two days.

HARRY

Nn.   Work.

The chopping continues.

Katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry.

Another beat.

KATIE

... That's enough carrots, don't you

think?

89.

HARRY

Huh?

KATIE

For the salad?

HARRY

You know: you're really a very

negative person.

KATIE

... What?

HARRY

I've tried. To ignore it.    And stay

upbeat.

KATIE

Harry: stop the foolishness.

HARRY

Stop the foolishness?

KATIE

Yes. And behave.    You are not talking

to one of your...

KATIE (CONT'D)

... "shithole buddies."

Blue Revision 8/1/07 90.

Harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge-

cushion tucked under an arm. He flings the front door open,

goes out, slams it shut.

Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the

cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out

his cell phone and dials.

A ring.   Pick-up.   A female voice:

SANDY

Hello?

HARRY

Honey.    It's so good to hear your

voice.

SANDY

Something wrong, Harry?

HARRY

No. Yes. Can you come home?       Your

baby needs you.

A beat.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Can you please come home?

SANDY

Harry, you know I----

HARRY

I can show you your present.     It's

finished.

SANDY

Oh Harry.    I can't just leave the book

tour.

Harry sags.

HARRY

Yeah.

SANDY

There are two days left.     There's

still Seattle.

HARRY

Yeah.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 91.

SANDY

I love you, Harry.

HARRY

Okay.   Yeah. Love you too.

He folds the phone, miserable.

As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the

side-view mirror:

The car parked across the street.    A man's shape in the

driver's seat.

Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the

drive.

The parked car starts.

HARRY

Hey!    Fucker!

The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars

front and back; it will need a couple moves.

Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into

reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the

frantically shuttling car.

He t-bones it.

VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR

Fucker!

Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the

driveway.

HARRY

Fucker!   Fucker!

He again throws the car into reverse.

The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and

scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.

Harry again smashes into the car.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 92.

The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the

sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change

jingling, yelling as he runs:

MAN

Fucker!

Harry runs after him, calling:

HARRY

Who do you work for?!   Who do you work

for?!

Pounding footsteps.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Tell me!

The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry

closes, leaps, and tackles.

He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Who do you work for? CIA?     NSC?

The other man is panting much harder:

MAN

Tuchman Marsh!

This stops Harry.   He isn't sure what he's heard.

HARRY

What?

MAN

Tuchman Marsh!

HARRY

... Tuchman Marsh?

MAN

Yes!

HARRY

Your name is... Tuchman Marsh?

MAN

Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!

93.

MAN (CONT'D)

... I work for them!

HARRY

You... work for Tuchman Marsh.

MAN

Yes!

HARRY

Which is a law firm.

MAN

No! A rock band!      Yes, it's a law

firm!

HARRY

Well... why are you following me?

MAN

Divorce action, numbnuts!

HARRY

My... my wife hired you?!

MAN

No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.

Tuchman Marsh hired me. I work for

Tuchman Marsh.

HARRY

You're----you're----a divorce detective.

MAN

Not just.     Credit, missing persons,

whatever.

HARRY

But this is divorce.

MAN

("duh")

Well... yeah.

94.

MAN (CONT'D)

... Jesus----grow up, man!    It happens

to everybody!

HARRY

Yeah?

VOICE

Harry, it's Osbourne Cox.

VOICE (CONT'D)

... Harry?

HARRY

Yeah?

OSBOURNE

Harry, could I get your wife's number?

This is Osbourne Cox, could I trouble

you for your wife's----

HARRY

You can't tell her anything she

doesn't already know, fucker.

OSBOURNE

What?

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

...Is this... Harry Pfarrer?

HARRY

You want... Sandy's number?

Blue Revision 8/1/07 95.

MAN

Can I use your phone?   To call a tow?

Osbourne paces the cramped cabin belowdecks, a phone to his

ear. He is unshaven, wearing a robe.

Filtered rings, then a connection:

SANDY'S VOICE

Hello?

OSBOURNE

Sandy?

SANDY

Yes?

OSBOURNE

Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you.

Hi.

SANDY

... Hi.

OSBOURNE

Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but

I have a, well, a publishing question

and I thought you might be the person

to ask, I have this manuscript,

something to do with my professional

experiences, not to go into too much

detail but I think it's pretty

explosive stuff and I think that it

could merit a fairly wide readership

handled properly and it isn't quite

finished yet but there's a situation

where I'm worried about it leaking now

and maybe excerpts being published or

on the internet, whatever, without my

permission, and a lot of the impact

being, um, blunted, so I'm actually

anxious to bring it to market sooner

than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in

fact----so I was thinking, I know you,

and you seem to do well, so I was

wondering if you were happy with your

publisher. The people you use.

A long beat.

96.

SANDY

You've written a children's book?

OSBOURNE

No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but

----doesn't your company have an adult

arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's

arm? Of a regular publisher?

SANDY

Pappas & Swain do children's

literature.

OSBOURNE

Uh-huh. I see. So they don't----

okay... Are you well?

SANDY

Very well thank you.    And you.

OSBOURNE

Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you

Sandy.

SANDY

Yes.    Good talking to you.

Disconnect.

Osbourne yanks the rubber band off a bundle of mail.

OSBOURNE

Bitch.

Two pairs of footsteps echo down a long hallway as Linda

Litzke is escorted by a solemn Russian staffer.

A waiting room.    A long beat; Linda sits waiting.

A door opens.    Mr. Krapotkin emerges.

Linda stands to go to the inner office but Krapotkin motions

her back down.

KRAPOTKIN

Yes, madam. Can we help you?

97.

LINDA

What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are

you running?! I've been waiting here

for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----

KRAPOTKIN

I am so sorry, madam.   An urgent

matter.

LINDA

Well this could be urgent too, since,

you know, Chad has been missing for

forty-eight hours now and----

KRAPOTKIN

I don't know the whereabouts of Chad,

madam.

LINDA

Well he was gathering information for

you when he----

KRAPOTKIN

We're not interested in such

"information". It was drivel.

LINDA

... Dribble!

KRAPOTKIN

Would you like your disk back?

LINDA

... Dribble!

KRAPOTKIN

I'm so sorry I can't help you.

LINDA

I'll tell you what's dribble! You

listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----

Blue Revision 8/1/07 98.

Looking the opposite way.

We hear two pairs of footsteps. They approach for several

beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede,

footsteps echoing. The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow.

As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda

jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it. She jerks away

again.

LINDA

Cut it out.

An exercise show plays on the TV, unwatched. Osbourne sits

at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed

envelope.

OSBOURNE

... What?

He brings the notice close, squints at it.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... What the fuck?

He quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail, pulls out

another envelope, rips it open.

Blue Revision 8/1/07 99.

A MINUTE LATER

Osbourne paces, drink in hand, staring at another piece of

mail.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

What the fuck?

A MINUTE LATER

Osbourne is back at the table, drink half-consumed, listening

at the phone.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know

why the check for my slip fee was

returned for insufficient funds...

Slip fee, for docking my boat, the

check was returned... No, m'dam, it's

not zero, I have about forty thousand

dollars in that account... When? ...

When?... But she can't do that----no,

yes, technically it may be a joint

account but she doesn't use it, it's

not her money... No! No! What

access, it's not possible! Without my

permission? What about the, my, the,

our savings account? My savings

account?... I don't know the fucking

number! You think I memorize the

fucking numbers on my fucking bank

accounts! Moron!... Hello?

We are looking at the exterior of the house in wide shot.         *

Peaceful neighborhood. Birds chirp.                               *

From inside the house, though, we can faintly hear sobs,          *

punctuated by sounds of exertion. Each gasp of effort ends        *

in a dull clang.                                                  *

The wracking sobs bump up loud at the cut inside.                 *

Harry is weeping as he demolishes the love seat with a            *

sledgehammer.                                                     *

Blue Revision 8/1/07 99A.

Ted stares, horrified.

After a beat:

TED

No-o-o-o-o-o way.   No way.   Whoa.   No

way, Linda...

She sits opposite him in his office.    Ted shakes his head.

TED (CONT'D)

... No.

LINDA

But Ted, I can't do it, I don't know

anything about computers.

TED

LINDA

LINDA

Blue Revision 8/1/07 101.

Weeping, she storms out.

Ted stares, shell-shocked.

In close shot, Ted sits onto a bar stool.

Dim bar, tinkling piano.

BARTENDER'S VOICE

What'll it be.

Ted stares straight ahead.     A long beat.

He finally focuses on the bartender, off.      He swallows.

Another beat.

TED

Seven & Seven.

Night. Linda is asleep in her bedroom.        The buzz of the in-

house intercom.

Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

LINDA

Hurrow----

She removes an appliance from her mouth.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Hello?

FILTERED VOICE

It's Harry.

Minutes later.   Harry is gazing off, slack-jawed, haunted.

After a beat:

HARRY

You think a marriage is... and then

you...

The thought drifts off.    A sad shake of the head.

102.

LINDA

But this was a long time coming.

HARRY

Was it?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Well, yeah... right...

LINDA

You're depressed, Harry.

HARRY

(hollowly)

I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I

haven't run in three days... butt-

crunches... anything... Do you think I

could stay here for a little while?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... What?    What's wrong, baby?

LINDA

It can't always come from me, Harry!

I'm not that strong!

HARRY

What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here.

LINDA

You're not here for me! I need a can-

do person! You're all... defeated!

HARRY

I'm sorry, baby----

LINDA

Chad is the only can-do person I know

and he's gone, Harry, he's gone.

103.

HARRY

I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just

need to exercise. Are there

pedestrian paths around here?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Who the fuck is Chad?

LINDA

Could you help me find him?  He's a

friend from work. You know law

enforcement people, right? You could

call, unofficially?

HARRY

Wait a minute, what's his name?   What

happened?

LINDA

Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared.

He hasn't been at work or at home for

two days.

HARRY

Okay.

LINDA

He----

HARRY

You know his social security number?

LINDA

Huh?     NO!    I----

HARRY

It's okay. That's okay.     What's the

last place you saw him?

LINDA

(snuffling)

I don't know! He just disappeared!

The last place I saw him was the Jamba

Juice on K Street. And he's gone.

HARRY

Okay baby. We'll find your friend.

Missing person. Piece of cake.

104.

AN EPIGLOTTIS

Illuminated by a small light. It quavers.       The tongue starts

to rise and the mouth starts to close.

WOMAN'S VOICE

No, stay open...

Wider: a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful

prints of cartoon characters and clowns.

Katie Cox, in a white smock, has a tongue depressor in a five-

year-old's mouth and a light-sight in one hand. She

withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth. The

child's mother stands by.

Katie grasps the child by the upper arm.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... You have to let the doctor look in

your mouth.

The child keeps his lips pressed together.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... Now you listen to me, young man.

You do as I say or I'll ask your

mother to leave the doctor's office

and the two of us will sort out what's

what.

The child looks at her fearfully.

The wall phone bleeps.

Katie rolls to it on her castored chair.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... Yes.

She listens briefly.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... With a patient.

She hangs up.

Osbourne, in dressing gown and pyjamas, is barking into the

phone:

105.

OSBOURNE

Yeah? The same patient she's been

with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!

FILTERED VOICE

Dr. Cox has suggested you call her

attorney----

OSBOURNE

Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new

fucking keys!

He slams down the phone.

The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below.

There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He

yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet.

OSBOURNE

New keys...

Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe,

hatchet in hand.

Sandy Pfarrer is sitting in an armchair on a morning show

living room set surrounded by a dozen eight-year-olds sitting

on the carpet. Hosts Del and Connie sit next to her in

swivel chairs.

SANDY

(reading)

And it was just then----at that very

moment----that Oliver sneezed----

DEL

Can    we just----I'm sorry to interrupt

but    we have to let the folks at home

see    this illustration! Can we just

get    a shot of that...

He is holding the book open, face out on his lap.

DEL (CONT'D)

There----there it is. Oliver.

Interrupting the filibuster with----

106.

CONNIE

That's wonderful!

DEL

Wonderful! The book is "Point of

Order, Oliver!" and the talented

author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna

go to a station break and then be

right back with Bud Fraighling, the

Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our

special interview with Dermot

Mulroney. So keep it where it is!

DEL (CONT'D)

...Great segment.

SANDY

Thank you.

DEL

Yeah, you know we thought it might be

fun if you joined us with Bud

Fraighling and help make the Fiesta

Salad, when we move over.

CONNIE

Over on the kitchen set.

SANDY

That wasn't discussed.

DEL

Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to!

Your segment went great, we just

thought----

SANDY

I'm sorry, I made plans.

DEL

Okay, great!

CONNIE

Great to see you again, Sandra!

107.

Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up. It cuts a corner of

the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive. Osbourne

emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet.

He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the

blunt end of the hatchet.

OSBOURNE

New... fucking... keys... How's this

for access...

Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop.

Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times,

decides he prefers the blunt end.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... How's this for motherfucking

access...

More things fall off.    The knob wobbles in the door.

Osbourne pushes the door open.

Sandy Pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young PR woman.

PR WOMAN

That was way out of line. We were so

unbelievably clear with them: just an

Oliver segment.

SANDY

It's fine.

PR WOMAN

Del and Connie are such putzes.

SANDY

It's fine.     Thank you.   We're

finished.

PR WOMAN

Huh?   Well, okay. Great, uh----

Sandy, entered her dressing room, is already shutting the

door on her.

108.

Inside a man lounges reading a magazine.   He looks a little

like Harry but younger.

SANDY

Thought that would never be over.

The man rises and kisses her.

MAN

Mmm.    Me too.

SANDY

Let me scrub this crap off my face.

Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering:

OSBOURNE

Just for starters...

He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a

packing case on the kitchen counter.

People sit on benches eating lunches. Harry Pfarrer is on

the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting

sunflower seeds.

Linda walks up.    They greet each other with a kiss.

HARRY

Hello there sunshine.    You look great.

LINDA

Well you seem better.

Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.

HARRY

Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time

this morning. And our exercise last

night didn't hurt!

Linda is shocked but secretly pleased:

LINDA

Harry!

109.

HARRY

Boy, I am through banging my head

against the wall. I am gonna start

doing what's right for me.

LINDA

That's how I believe, also.   You have

to do what's right for----

HARRY

Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a

shock recently, and I realized you

know, life is not infinite. No one's

immortal.

LINDA

No one's immortal.

HARRY

You have to get from each day its

full, uh, squeeze the juice from every

day because there but for the grace of

God----

LINDA

Exactly. The important thing is to

maintain a positive outlook. Always

up. Always ebullient.

HARRY

That's right, don't sweat the small

stuff...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... and it's all small stuff.

HARRY (CONT'D)

This is where we first met.   Remember?

LINDA

Of course I do.

HARRY

You never know what the important days

are, until... until, um...

110.

HARRY (CONT'D)

... I told myself I was gonna stop

being paranoid, but... is that guy

looking at us?

LINDA

(hastily)

No, no.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Have you found out anything about

Chad?

HARRY

Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.

I don't think it'll take long.

LINDA

Really?

HARRY

Oh yeah, there are so many data bases

now it's a joke...

HARRY (CONT'D)

... Back when I was in PP there was

still some art to finding people. Not

any more. And now with the cell

phones? Pretty soon they're gonna

know where everyone is. Everyone. At

any given moment. I mean it's almost

the reality now. You would be amazed.

LINDA

Uh-huh.

111.

HARRY

Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice

----did Chad say anything about where he

might be going?

LINDA

Oh, I know where he was going.

HARRY

Oh yeah?

LINDA

A residence in Alexandria.    On

Hillsboro Drive.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... 2055 Hillsboro.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... It's, um. The residence of a guy

named Osbourne Cox.

HARRY

Who are you?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... WHO ARE YOU?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

HARRY (CONT'D)

... WHO ARE YOU? REALLY?

112.

Linda is at sea.    She answers in a small voice:

LINDA

I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.

Harry stares at her.

A long beat.

He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.

His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with

plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again.

Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching?

Hard to say.

Harry turns and runs.       Linda gapes.

LINDA (CONT'D)

... Harry!

Osbourne sets the packing box heavily      down on a bureau in the

upstairs bedroom. The box is a third       loaded up with liquor

bottles. It also holds a mixed drink       which Osbourne now

takes out. The ice cubes clink as he       sips, poking through

things in the bureau.

One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case.

He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the

cardboard box.

Suddenly:

OSBOURNE

Ow!   Fuck!

He yanks his hand back and shakes it.      He looks at the ball

of his thumb. He sucks it.

He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and

flings it across the room.

He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.

He suddenly stops:

A faint knock.    The front door.

Osbourne waits.

The knock repeats.

113.

Another beat.

The front door creaks open.

Osbourne carefully sets down his drink. He steps quietly to

the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf.

Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street

bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.

Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look

snags on:

A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls

in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He

reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.

Linda frowns.   She looks forward, glances again at the

mirror.

Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.    Its

driver is also a man in sunglasses.

Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to

living room, a handgun at the ready. His drink is in his

other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.

The living room is empty.

Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the

kitchen.

Empty.

He proceeds to the basement door.

LINDA DRIVING

She gives worried glances at her rear-view.

The light ahead turns yellow, red.

Cars ahead stop.   Linda stops.

A rhythmic thudding sound.    It almost makes her car vibrate.

114.

She looks around.   She rolls down her window, sticks her head

out, looks up.

A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-

clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking

down.

Linda draws her head back in.

LINDA

Oh for Pete's sake.

Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in

either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.

The basement comes slowly into view.

Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.

Osbourne descends further. He stops on the bottom step and

stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.

Ted stares at him.

A long silence between the two men.

Then, quietly:

OSBOURNE

And you are... my wife's lover.

TED

No.

OSBOURNE

Then what are you doing here.

Silence.

Osbourne takes the last step down.    He advances slowly, gun

trained on Ted.

Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... I know you. You're the guy at the

gym.

Ted licks his lips.

TED

I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

115.

OSBOURNE

I know what you represent. You

represent the idiocy of today.

TED

I don't represent that, either.

OSBOURNE

Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to

ask about that moronic woman.

TED

She's not----

OSBOURNE

You're in league with that moronic

woman. You're part of a league of

morons.

TED

No.

OSBOURNE

Yes. You're one of the morons I've

been fighting all my life. My whole

fucking life. But guess what. Guess

what. Today I win.

TED

Ah!

OSBOURNE

Oh!

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Oooph!

Pink Revision 8/14/07 116.

OSBOURNE (CONT'D)

... Stop!     Intruder!

Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest.

He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe

flapping, pursuing with the hatchet.

OSBOURNE

Intruder!

He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him.

TED

Oh!

Osbourne whacks him down.       He keeps whacking at him.

Gardner Chubb is behind his desk.

GARDNER CHUBB

Wait.

Palmer DeBakey Smith is seated across from him.      He freezes.

A beat.

Gardner Chubb rubs his forehead.

GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)

... Wait a minute. Where's the

treasury guy? Pfarrer?

PALMER

Right now?

GARDNER CHUBB

Right now.

PALMER

In a detention room at Washington

Dulles.                                                        *

GARDNER CHUBB

... Why?

PALMER

He was trying to board a flight to

Venezuela.

(MORE)

117.

PALMER (CONT'D)

We had his name on a hot list, the INS

pulled him. Don't know why he was

going to Venezuela.

GARDNER CHUBB

You don't know.

PALMER

No sir.

GARDNER CHUBB

We have no extradition with Venezuela.

PALMER

Oh. Uh-huh. Well----what should we do

with him?

GARDNER CHUBB

For fuck's sake, put him on the next

flight to Venezuela!

PALMER

Yes sir.     Okay.

GARDNER CHUBB

Okay.      So the gym manager is dead.

PALMER

Yes sir.

GARDENER CHUBB

The body is----

PALMER

Gone, sir.

GARDENER CHUBB

Okay----

PALMER

But----there was a, uh... snag...

GARDNER CHUBB

What.

PALMER

Well. This analyst, Cox, was

attacking the gym guy. It was broad

daylight, on the street. Our man

there didn't know what to do. He felt

he had to step in.

118.

GARDNER CHUBB

Yes?

PALMER

He, uh... He shot the analyst.      He

shot Cox.

GARDNER CHUBB

Good!    Great! Is he dead?

PALMER

No sir.

PALMER (CONT'D)

... He's in coma. They're not sure

whether he'll make it. They think,

they're pretty sure he has no brain

function.

GARDNER CHUBB

Okay. Okay. If he wakes up we'll

worry about it then. Jesus, what a

clusterfuck. That's it then. No one

else really knows anything. Okay.

PALMER

Um.     Well sir, there is...

GARDNER CHUBB

What.

PALMER

Um...

GARDNER CHUBB

What.

PALMER

There is the woman.   The gym woman.

Linda Litzke.

GARDNER CHUBB

Oh yeah.   Fuck. Where is she.

PALMER

We picked her up.    We have her.

GARDNER CHUBB

Can we, uh----

119.

PALMER

She, she, she says she'll play ball if

we pay for some... I know this sounds

odd----some surgeries she wants.

Cosmetic surgery. She says she'll sit

on everything.

GARDNER CHUBB

How much.

PALMER

There were several procedures.    All

together they run to, um----

GARDNER CHUBB

Pay it.

PALMER

Yes sir. Should I pay it out of,

should it be from----

GARDNER CHUBB

One of the black accounts, I don't

give a shit. The January fund.

Whatever.

PALMER

Okay.

GARDNER CHUBB

Jesus.    Jesus fucking Christ.

GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)

... What did we learn, Palmer.

PALMER

I don't know, sir.

GARDNER CHUBB

I don't fucking know either. I guess

we learned not to do it again.

PALMER

Yes sir.

GARDNER CHUBB

Although I'm fucked if I know what we

did.

PALMER

Yes sir.    Hard to say.

120.

We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head.

GARDNER CHUBB

Jesus.   Jesus fucking Christ.

We pull up, back through the clouds, away.
