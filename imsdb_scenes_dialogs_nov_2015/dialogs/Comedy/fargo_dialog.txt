FARGO

a screenplay by

Ethan Coen

and

Joel Coen

FARGO

CLERK

And how are you today, sir?

MAN

Real good now.  I'm checking in

- Mr. Anderson.

CLERK

Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're

still planning on staying with

us just the night, then?

ANDERSON

You bet.

NEWS ANCHOR

- whether they will go to summer

camp at all.  Katie Jensen has

more.

KATIE

It was supposed to be a project

funded by the city council;  it

was supposed to benefit those

Fargo-Moorehead children who

would otherwise not be able to

afford to attend a lakeshore

summer camp.  But nobody consulted

city controller Stu Jacobson...

WAITRESS

Can I warm that up for ya there?

ANDERSON

You bet.

ANDERSON

I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

YOUNGER MAN

You're Jerry Lundegaard?

JERRY

Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

YOUNGER MAN

Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.

What gives, man?

JERRY

Shep said 8:30.

YOUNGER MAN

We been sitting here an hour.

I've peed three times already.

JERRY

I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told

me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I

guess.

YOUNGER MAN

Ya got the car?

JERRY

Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot

there.  Brand-new burnt umber

Ciera.

YOUNGER MAN

Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.

I'm Carl Showalter and this is

my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

JERRY

Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we

all set on this thing, then?

YOUNGER MAN

Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why

wouldn't we be?

JERRY

Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep

vouched for you and all.  I got

every confidence in you fellas.

JERRY

...  So I guess that's it, then.

Here's the keys -

CARL

No, that's not it, Jerry.

JERRY

Huh?

CARL

The new vehicle, plus forty

thousand dollars.

JERRY

Yah, but the deal was, the car

first, see, then the forty

thousand, like as if it was the

ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

CARL

Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

JERRY

Well, okay, it's -

CARL

Except that you were gonna be

here at 7:30.

JERRY

Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

CARL

Yeah, you already said that.

JERRY

Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-

in-advance deal.  I give you a

brand-new vehicle in advance and -

CARL

I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

JERRY

Okay.

CARL

I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

I will say this though:  what Shep

told us didn't make a whole lot

of sense.

JERRY

Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's

all worked out.

CARL

You want your own wife kidnapped?

JERRY

Yah.

CARL

...  You - my point is, you pay

the ransom - what eighty thousand

bucks? -  I mean, you give us

half the ransom, forty thousand,

you keep half.  It's like robbing

Peter to play Paul, it doesn't

make any -

JERRY

Okay, it's - see, it's not me

payin' the ransom.  The thing is,

my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,

he's real well off.  Now, I'm in

a bit of trouble -

CARL

What kind of trouble are you in,

Jerry?

JERRY

Well, that's, that's, I'm not go

inta, inta - see, I just need

money.  Now, her dad's real

wealthy -

CARL

So why don't you just ask him

for the money?

GRIMSRUD

Or your fucking wife, you know.

CARL

Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

JERRY

Well, it's all just part of this -

they don't know I need it, see.

Okay, so there's that.  And even

if they did, I wouldn't get it.

So there's that on top, then.  See,

these're personal matters.

CARL

Personal matters.

JERRY

Yah.  Personal matters that

needn't, uh -

CARL

Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us

to perform this mission, but you,

you won't, uh, you won't - aw,

fuck it, let's take a look at

that Ciera.

JERRY

Hon?  Got the growshries.

VOICE

Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

JERRY

Yah, real good.

VOICE

Dad's here.

JERRY

How ya doin', Wade?

WADE

Yah, pretty good.

JERRY

Whatcha watchin' there?

WADE

Norstars.

JERRY

WADE

OOOoooh!

JERRY

Is he stayin' for supper, then?

WIFE

Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you

stayin' for supper?

WADE

(off)

Yah.

SCOTTY

May I be excused?

JERRY

Sure, ya done there?

SCOTTY

Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

WIFE

Where are you going?

SCOTTY

Just out.  Just McDonald's.

JERRY

Back at 9:30.

SCOTTY

Okay.

WADE

He just ate.  And he didn't finish.

He's going to McDonald's instead

of finishing here?

WIFE

He sees his friends there.  It's

okay.

WADE

It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do

you think they do there?  They

don't drink milkshakes, I assure

you!

WIFE

It's okay, Dad.

JERRY

Wade, have ya had a chance to

think about, uh, that deal I was

talkin' about, those forty acres

there on Wayzata?

WADE

You told me about it.

JERRY

Yah, you said you'd have a think

about it.  I understand it's a

lot of money -

WADE

A heck of a lot.  What'd you

say you were gonna put there?

JERRY

A lot.  It's a limited -

WADE

I know it's a lot.

JERRY

I mean a parking lot.

WADE

Yah, well, seven hundred and

fifty thousand dollars is a lot

- ha ha ha!

JERRY

Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

WADE

I thought you were gonna show

it to Stan Grossman.  He passes

on this stuff before it gets

kicked up to me.

JERRY

Well, you know Stan'll say no

dice.  That's why you pay him.

I'm asking you here, Wade.  This

could work out real good for me

and Jean and Scotty -

WADE

Jean and Scotty never have to

worry.

GRIMSRUD

Where is Pancakes Hause?

CARL

What?

GRIMSRUD

We stop at Pancakes Hause.

CARL

What're you, nuts?  We had

pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta

go somewhere I can get a shot

and a beer - and a steak maybe.

Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come

on.

CARL

...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's

an idea.  We'll stop outside of

Brainerd.  I know a place there

we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

GRIMSRUD

I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

CARL

Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',

we'll stop for pancakes, then

we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

CUSTOMER

JERRY

Yah, but that TruCoat -

CUSTOMER

I sat right here and said I didn't

want no TruCoat!

JERRY

Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,

you don't get it and you get

oxidization problems.  It'll cost

hunnert -

CUSTOMER

You're sittin' here, you're talkin'

in circles!  You're talkin' like

we didn't go over this already!

JERRY

Yah, but this TruCoat -

CUSTOMER

We had us a deal here for nine-

you'd get this car, these options,

WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-

teen-five!

JERRY

Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

CUSTOMER

You called me twenty minutes ago

JERRY

CUSTOMER

SALESMAN

SALESMAN

JERRY

Well, he never done this before,

but seein' as it's special

circumstances and all, he says I

TruCoat.

CUSTOMER

One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.

Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced

liar!

CUSTOMER

...  A fucking liar -

WIFE

JERRY

SHEP

Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

JERRY

Well, yah, but he had a buddy

there.  He, uh -

SHEP

Well, I don't vouch for him.

JERRY

Well, that's okay, I just -

SHEP

I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his

buddy?

JERRY

Carl somethin'?

SHEP

Never heard of him.  Don't vouch

for him.

JERRY

Well, that's okay, he's a buddy

of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm

not worryin'.  I just, I was

wonderin', see, I gotta get in

touch with 'em for, I might not

need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',

see -

SHEP

Call 'em up.

JERRY

Yah, well, see, I did that, and

I haven't been able to get 'em,

so I thought you maybe'd know an

alternate number or what have ya.

SHEP

Nope.

JERRY

Okay, well, real good, then.

CARL

...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.

IDS Building, the big glass one.

Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.

After the Sears, uh, Chicago...

You never been to Minneapolis?

GRIMSRUD

No.

CARL

...  Would it kill you to say

something?

GRIMSRUD

I did.

CARL

"No." First thing you've said

in the last four hours.  That's

a, that's a fountain of conversation,

man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,

daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm

sittin' here driving, man, doin'

all the driving, whole fuckin' way

from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,

you know, tryin' to chat, keep

our spirits up, fight the boredom

of the road, and you can't say one

fucking thing just in the way of

conversation.

CARL

...  Well, fuck it, I don't have

to talk either, man.  See how

you like it...

CARL

...  Total silence...

JERRY

Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

VOICE

Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.

You're damned hard to get on the

phone.

JERRY

Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,

but that's the way we like it.

VOICE

That's for sure.  Now, I just

need, on these last, these financing

documents you sent us, I can't

read the serial numbers of the

vehicles on here, so I -

JERRY

But I already got the, it's okay,

the loans are in place, I already

got the, the what, the -

VOICE

Yeah, the three hundred and twenty

thousand dollars, you got the money

last month.

JERRY

Yah, so we're all set.

VOICE

Yeah, but the vehicles you were

borrowing on, I just can't read

the serial numbers on your

applicaton.  Maybe if you could

just read them to me -

JERRY

But the deal's already done, I

already got the money -

VOICE

Yeah, but we have an audit here,

I just have to know that these

vehicles you're financing with

this money, that they really

exist.

JERRY

Yah, well, they exist all right.

VOICE

I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But

I can't read their serial numbers

here.  So if you could read me -

JERRY

Well, but see, I don't have 'em

in front a me - why don't I just

fax you over a copy -

VOICE

No, fax is no good, that's what

I have and I can't read the darn

thing -

JERRY

Yah, okay, I'll have my girl

send you over a copy, then.

VOICE

Okay, because if I can't correlate

this note with the specific vehicles,

then I gotta call back that money -

JERRY

Yah, how much money was that?

VOICE

Three hundred and twenty thousand

dollars.  See, I gotta correlate

that money with the cars it's being

lent on.

JERRY

Yah, no problem, I'll just fax

that over to ya, then.

VOICE

No, no, fax is -

JERRY

I mean send it over.  I'll shoot

it right over to ya.

VOICE

Okay.

JERRY

Okay, real good, then.

HOST

So I seperate the - how the heck

do I get the egg out of the shell

without breaking it?

HOSTESS

You just prick a little hole in

the end and blow!

HOST

Okay, here goes nothing.

AUDIENCE

Awoooo!

GRIMSRUD

Unguent.

CARL

Huh?

GRIMSRUD

I need ... unguent.

JERRY

How ya doin' there, Stan?  How

are ya, Wade?

STAN

Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If

these numbers are right, this

looks pretty sweet.

JERRY

Oh, those numbers are all right,

bleemee.

WADE

This is do-able.

STAN

Congratulations, Jerry.

JERRY

Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

WADE

What kind of finder's fee were

you looking for?

JERRY

...  Huh?

STAN

The financials are pretty thorough,

so the only thing we don't know

is your fee.

JERRY

...  My fee?  Wade, what the

heck're you talkin' about?

WADE

Stan and I're okay.

JERRY

Yah.

WADE

We're good to loan in.

JERRY

Yah.

WADE

But we never talked about your

fee for bringin' it to us.

JERRY

No, but, Wade, see, I was

bringin' you this deal for you

to loan me the money to put

in.  It's my deal here, see?

STAN

Jerry - we thought you were

bringin' us an investment.

JERRY

Yah, right -

STAN

You're sayin' - what're you

sayin'?

WADE

You're sayin' that we put in

all the money and you collect

when it pays off?

JERRY

No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you

back the principal, and interest

- heck, I'd go - one over prime -

STAN

We're not a bank, Jerry.

WADE

What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted

bank interest on seven hunnert'n

fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest

Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

STAN

He's at Norstar.

WADE

He's at -

JERRY

No, see, I don't need a finder's

fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,

ten percent, heck that's not gonna

do it for me.  I need the principal.

STAN

Jerry, we're not just going to

give you seven hundred and fifty

thousand dollars.

WADE

What the heck were you thinkin'?

Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank

interest, I'd look for complete

security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't

see nothin' like that here.

JERRY

Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd

guarantee ya your money back.

WADE

I'm not talkin' about your damn

word, Jerry.  Geez, what the

heck're you?...  Well, look, I

don't want to cut you out of the

loop, but his here's a good deal.

I assume, if you're not innarested,

you won't mind if we move on it

independently.

JERRY

Hon?

JERRY

...  Got the growshries...

JERRY

...  Hon?

JERRY

Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

JERRY

...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's

Jerry...

JERRY

...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we

gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

JERRY

...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

GRIMSRUD

Shut the fuck up or I'll throw

you back in the trunk, you know.

CARL

Geez.  That's more'n I've heard

you say all week.

CARL

Ah, shit, the tags...

CARL

...  It's just the tags.  I never

put my tags on the car.  Don't

worry, I'll take care of this.

CARL

...  Let's keep still back there,

lady, or we're gonna have to, ya

know, to shoot ya.

CARL

...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

CARL

How can I help you, officer?

TROOPER

This is a new car, then, sir?

CARL

It certainly is, officer.  Still

got that smell!

TROOPER

You're required to display

temporary tags, either in the

plate area or taped inside the

back window.

CARL

Certainly -

TROOPER

Can I see your license and

registration please?

CARL

Certainly.

CARL

...  I was gonna tape up the

temporary tag, ya know, to be

in full compliance, but it, uh,

it, uh ... must a slipped my

mind...

CARL

...  So maybe the best thing

would be to take care of that,

right here in Brainerd.

TROOPER

What's this, sir?

CARL

That's my license and regis-

tration.  I wanna be in

compliance.

CARL

...  I was just thinking I could

take care of it right here.  In

Brainerd.

TROOPER

Put that back in your pocket,

please.

TROOPER

...  And step out of the car,

please, sir.

GRIMSRUD

Shut up.

CARL

(softly)

Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

GRIMSRUD

You'll take care of it.  Boy, you

are smooth smooth, you know.

CARL

Whoa, Daddy.

GRIMSRUD

Clear him off the road.

CARL

Yeah.

WOMAN

Oh, geez...

WOMAN

MARGE

Oh, geez...

MARGE

Real good, then.

MARGE

Gotta go?

MARGE

Yah.

MARGE

That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

MAN

Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.

I'll fix ya some eggs.

MARGE

Aw, you can sleep, hon.

MAN

Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

MAN

MARGE

Aw, Norm.

MARGE

Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

NORM

Love ya, Margie.

MARGE

Love ya, hon.

MARGE

Hon?

NORM

(off)

Yah?

MARGE

Prowler needs a jump.

MARGE

Hiya, Lou.

LOU

Margie.  Thought you might need

a little warm-up.

MARGE

Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's

the deal, now?  Gary says triple

homicide?

LOU

Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two

of'm're over here.

MARGE

Where is everybody?

LOU

Well - it's cold, Margie.

MARGE

Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.

Here's the second one...  It's

in the head and the ... hand

there, I guess that's a defensive

wound.  Okay.

MARGE

...  Where's the state trooper?

LOU

Back there a good piece.  In

the ditch next to his prowler.

MARGE

Okay, so we got a state trooper

pulls someone over, we got a

shooting, and these folks drive

by, and we got a high-speed

pursuit, ends here, and this

execution-type deal.

LOU

Yah.

MARGE

I'd be very surprised if our

suspect was from Brainerd.

LOU

Yah.

MARGE

Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from

his footprints he looks like a big

fella -

LOU

Ya see something down there, Chief?

MARGE

Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

LOU

Geez, you okay, Margie?

MARGE

I'm fine - it's just morning

sickness.

MARGE

...  Well, that passed.

LOU

Yah?

MARGE

Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

LOU

You had breakfast yet, Margie?

MARGE

Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

LOU

Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

MARGE

Let's go take a look at that

trooper.

MARGE

There's two of 'em, Lou!

LOU

Yah?

MARGE

Yah, this guy's smaller than

his buddy.

LOU

Oh, yah?

MARGE

For Pete's sake.

LOU

How's it look, Marge?

MARGE

Well, he's got his gun on his hip

there, and he looks like a nice

enough guy.  It's a real shame.

LOU

Yah.

MARGE

You haven't monkeyed with his car

there, have ya?

LOU

No way.

MARGE

Somebody shut his lights.  I guess

the little guy sat in there, waitin'

for his buddy t'come back.

LOU

Yah, woulda been cold out here.

MARGE

Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open

yet?

LOU

You don't think he's mixed up in -

MARGE

No, no, I just wanna get Norm some

night crawlers.

MARGE

You look in his citation book?

LOU

Yah...

LOU

...  Last vehicle he wrote in

was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.

Under the plate number he put

DLR - I figure they stopped him

or shot him before he could finish

fillin' out the tag number.

MARGE

Uh-huh.

LOU

So I got the state lookin' for a

Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.

They don't got no match yet.

MARGE

I'm not sure I agree with you a

hunnert percent on your policework,

there, Lou.

LOU

Yah?

MARGE

Yah, I think that vehicle there

probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

LOU

Oh...

LOU

...  Geez.

MARGE

Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one

about the guy who couldn't afford

personalized plates, so he went

and changed his name to J2L 4685?

LOU

Yah, that's a good one.

MARGE

Yah.

WADE

-  All's I know is, ya got a

problem, ya call a professional!

JERRY

No!  They said no cops!  They were

darned clear on that, Wade!  They

WADE

Well, a course they're gonna say

They got Jean here!  I give these

A million dollars is a lot a damn

money!  And there they are, they

JERRY

Yah, but think this thing through

this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

JERRY

No!  No cops!  That's final!  This

STAN

I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'

to Jerry's viewpoint here.

WADE

Well -

STAN

We gotta protect Jean.  These -

we're not holdin' any cards here,

Wade, they got all of 'em.  So

they call the shots.

JERRY

You're darned tootin'!

WADE

Ah, dammit!

STAN

STAN

Yah.

JERRY

Ya know, they said no one listenin'

He was a little older.  Looked like

the Marlboro man.

MARGE

Yah?

HOOKER TWO

Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause

MARGE

Uh-huh.

HOOKER TWO

A subconscious-type thing.

It's just hard for me to believe

you can't remember anyone calling.

MARGE

...  Now, I know you've had some

problems, struggling with the

narcotics, some other entanglements,

currently on parole -

SHEP

So?

MARGE

Well, associating with criminals,

if you're the one they talked to,

that right there would be a

violation of your parole and would

end with you back in Stillwater.

SHEP

Uh-huh.

MARGE

Now, I saw some rough stuff on

your priors, but nothing in the

nature of a homicide...

MARGE

...  I know you don't want to be

an accessory to something like

that.

SHEP

Nope.

MARGE

So you think you might remember

who those folks were who called

ya?

MARGE

Mr. Lundegaard?

Huh?  Yah?

GARY

Officer Olson.

MAN

Yah, right-o.

MAN

...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at

Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday

and this little guy's drinkin'

and he says, 'So where can a guy

find some action - I'm goin' crazy

down there at the lake.'  And I

says, 'What kinda action?' and he

says, 'Woman action, what do I

look like,'  And I says 'Well,

what do I look like, I don't

arrange that kinda thing,' and he

says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there

at the lake' and I says, 'Well,

this ain't that kinda place.'

GARY

Uh-huh.

MAN

So he says, 'So I get it, so you

think I'm some kinda jerk for

askin',' only he doesn't use the

word jerk.

GARY

I unnerstand.

MAN

And then he calls me a jerk and

says the last guy who thought he

was a jerk was dead now.  So I

don't say nothin' and he says, 'What

do ya think about that?'  So I

says, 'Well, that don't sound like

too good a deal for him then.'

GARY

Ya got that right.

MAN

And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead

and I don't mean a old age.'  And

then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'

crazy out there at the lake.'

GARY

White Bear Lake?

MAN

Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's

closer ta Moose Lake, so I made

that assumption.

GARY

Oh sure.

MAN

So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I

don't think a whole great deal of

it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the

homicides out here and she thought

I should call it in, so I called

it in.  End a story.

GARY

What'd this guy look like anyways?

MAN

Oh, he was a little guy, kinda

funny-lookin'.

GARY

Uh-huh - in what way?

MAN

Just a general way.

GARY

Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.

Mohra.  You're right, it's probably

up to Brainerd.

VOICE

Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

MARGE

Mm.  But ya think he's all right?

I saw him last night and he's -

VOICE

What'd he say?

MARGE

Well, it was nothin' specific

he said, it just seemd like it

all hit him really hard, his

wife dyin' -

VOICE

His wife?

MARGE

Linda.

VOICE

No.

MARGE

Linda Cooksey?

VOICE

No.  No.  No.  They weren't -

he, uh, he was bothering Linda

for about, oh, for a good year.

Really pestering her, wouldn't

leave her alone.

MARGE

So ... they didn't...

VOICE

No.  No.  They never married.

Mike's had psychiatric problems.

MARGE

Oh.  Oh, my.

VOICE

Yah, he - he's been struggling.

He's living with his parents now.

MARGE

Oh.  Geez.

VOICE

Yah, Linda's fine.  You should

call her.

MARGE

Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a

suprise.

MARGE

Hello?

MARGE

Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother

you again.  Can I come in?

JERRY

Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda

busy -

MARGE

I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real

short, then.  I'm on my way out

of town, but I was just -  Do you

mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying

a bit of a load here.

JERRY

No, I -

MARGE

Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you

about yesterday.  I was just

wondering -

JERRY

Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had

any vehicles go missing.

MARGE

Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,

how do you know?  Because, see,

the crime I'm investigating, the

perpetrators were driving a car

with dealer plates.  And they

called someone who works here, so

it'd be quite a coincidence if

they weren't, ya know, connected.

JERRY

Yah, I see.

MARGE

So how do you - have you done any

kind of inventory recently?

JERRY

The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

MARGE

but do you know that for sure

without -

JERRY

Well, I would know.  I'm the

Executive Sales Manager.

MARGE

Yah, but -

JERRY

We run a pretty tight ship here.

MARGE

I know, but - well, how do you

establish that, sir?  Are the

cars, uh, counted daily or what

kind of -

JERRY

Ma'am, I answered your question.

MARGE

...  I'm sorry, sir?

JERRY

Ma'am, I answered your question.

I answered the darn -  I'm

cooperating here, and I...

MARGE

Sir, you have no call to get

snippy with me.  I'm just doin'

my job here.

JERRY

I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.

I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh

- we're doin' all we can...

MARGE

Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

MARGE

...  Mr. Lundegaard?

JERRY

Well, heck, if you wanna, if you

wanna play games here!  I'm

workin' with ya on this thing, but

I...

JERRY

Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

MARGE

Sir?  Right now?

JERRY

Sure right now!  You're darned

tootin'!

JERRY

...  If it's so damned imporant

to ya!

MARGE

I'm sorry, sir, I -

JERRY

Aw, what the Christ!

MARGE

...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

MARGE

...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

MARGE

...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the

interview.  He's feelin' the

interview...

MARGE

...  Detective Sibert, please...

WOMAN

Well, so far we're just saying he's

wanted for questioning in connection

with a triple homicide.  Nobody at

the dealship there's been much help

guessing where he might go...

MARGE

Uh-huh.

WOMAN

We called his house; his little

boy said he hadn't been there.

MARGE

And his wife?

WOMAN

She's visiting relatives in Florida.

Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,

he's also disappeared.  Nobody at

his office knows where he is.

MARGE

Geez.  Looks like this thing goes

higher than we thought.  You call

his home?

WOMAN

His wife's in the hospital, has

been for a couple months.  The big C.

MARGE

Oh, my.

WOMAN

And this Shep Proudfoot character,

he's a little darling.  He's now

wanted for assault and parole

violation.  He clobbered a neighbor

of his last night and another

person who could be one of your perps,

and he's at large.

MARGE

Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

WOMAN

Well, they're all out on the wire.

Well, you know...

MARGE

Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you

enough, Detective Sibert, this

cooperation has been outstanding.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

Ah, well, we haven't had to run

around like you.  When're you due?

MARGE

End a April.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

Any others?

MARGE

This'll be our first.  We've been

waiting a long time.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll

change your life, a course.

MARGE

Oh, yah, I know that!

DETECTIVE SIBERT

They can really take over, that's

for sure.

MARGE

You have children?

DETECTIVE SIBERT

I thought you'd never ask.  The

older one is Janet, she's nine, and

the younger one is Morgan.

MARGE

Oh, now he's adorable.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

He's three now.  Course, not in that

picture.

MARGE

Oh, he's adorable.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

Yah, he -

MARGE

Where'd you get him that parka?

DETECTIVE SIBERT

Both of these.

MARGE

Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

DETECTIVE SIBERT

Oh, don't be silly.
