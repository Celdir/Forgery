THIS IS 40

DEBBIE

Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!

PETE

Oh my god. So incredible. Want to

know a secret? I took a Viagra.

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

I took a Viagra. Those things

totally work. This is awesome. Why

don't I use this every day?

DEBBIE

What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.

PETE

What's the matter?

DEBBIE

You just took a Viagra to have sex

with me?

PETE

I thought it would make it better.

It was better. It takes some of the

pressure off.

DEBBIE

Because you can't get hard without

a Viagra? Is it because you don't

think I'm sexy?

PETE

I thought you'd think it was fun

for me to supersize it for once.

DEBBIE

That is the worst birthday present

you could ever give someone.

PETE

I was just trying to go turbo for

your birthday.

(MORE)

2.

PETE (CONT'D)

My hard-ons are still in analog.

This shit's digital.

DEBBIE

I don't want a turbo penis. I like

your medium soft one.

PETE

Look, I can get it up. Just not

that far up.

DEBBIE

Where did you get this?

PETE

I got it from Barry.

DEBBIE

What? You got it from Barry?

PETE

Why do you care? This is my dick

we're talking about, not yours.

DEBBIE

We are young people. We don't need

medication to have sex.

PETE

I only took it because it's your

birthday. I thought you'd like it.

Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

DEBBIE

I am not forty! And I don't want to

have a husband who has to take

Viagra to get a hard-on.

PETE

I don't have to take it every time,

but once in a while...

DEBBIE

Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.

3.

SADIE

Your breath smells weird.

PETE

Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.

PETE (O.C.)

We're ready!

PETE

Make a wish!

4.

CHARLOTTE

Can I watch Lost?

SADIE

You can't handle Lost. It's too

violent, and you won't understand.

CHARLOTTE

If I don't understand it, why can't

I handle it?

SADIE

Because you're eight.

CHARLOTTE

I can handle it. I've seen a shark

eat a guy on Shark Week.

SADIE

Shark Week is fake.

CHARLOTTE

No, it's not.

SADIE

All of it is reenactments.

CHARLOTTE

I know but they--

SADIE

That's scary! You shouldn't be

allowed to watch that.

CHARLOTTE

--they show the reenactments but

they actually happened.

SADIE

It's going to give you nightmares.

CHARLOTTE

I can handle a nightmare. You're a

nightmare every day for me.

DEBBIE

Hey. Don't eat that cupcake.

5.

PETE

What?

DEBBIE

The one you just put into the sink.

I saw you were hiding that.

PETE

This cupcake? You think I'm going

to eat this cupcake?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

PETE

I so don't want this cupcake. Look.

DEBBIE

You're still going to eat it.

PETE

I'm going to eat this cupcake?

DEBBIE

Just put it in the trash.

PETE

What would you like to do today?

Your choice.

DEBBIE

Anything?

PETE

Yeah, anything.

DEBBIE

Just hang out with you guys.

PETE

Don't you want to get a massage? Or

do something fun? Forty's huge.

DEBBIE

I'm turning thirty-eight.

PETE

Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on.

Isn't it weird that our birthday is

the same week and that we're going

to have a party, and it's just for

me?

6.

DEBBIE

No. I don't think it's weird at

all. Because you're turning forty

and I'm turning thirty-eight.

PETE

Come on. Do you really want to be

one of those ladies who's just so

insecure about their age and they

lie and then they've got to

remember.

DEBBIE

You don't get it. You don't

understand how it works. I don't

want to shop at old lady stores. I

don't want to go to J. Jill and

Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not

ready yet. I need two more years.

PETE

That is so insane, it kind of makes

sense.

DEBBIE

What did you get me for my

birthday?

PETE

I thought you said that we

shouldn't get each other gifts this

year?

DEBBIE

What do you mean? You're supposed

to get me a surprise gift. This is

a big birthday. I'm turning forty!

SADIE (O.C.)

Mom!!

SADIE

Mom! Why can't I get new clothes?!

Nothing fits me!! God damn it!!

7.

DEBBIE

I am going to work out. I'll be

back in about an hour.

PETE

Hey, did your father call to wish

you a happy birthday?

DEBBIE

No. That's no surprise.

JASON

Come on.

BARB

Coming.

JASON

You've got to keep up with us,

sweetheart. That's why your body

looks like your body and her body

looks like her body. Before, after.

Before, after.

BARB

You guys just go on without me. I'm

just gonna... fuck.

BARRY

Hey, thanks for letting me join

this team.

8.

PETE

It's not really a team, it's just a

bunch of guys who get together and

ride.

BARRY

I know, I know.

PETE

Bike lane, asshole! It's always the

guy in the fucking Infiniti.

JASON

So why on earth is Pete taking

Viagra? What's going on?

DEBBIE

I don't know. I think maybe he just

isn't attracted to me anymore.

JASON

That is ridiculous. If you were my

girlfriend, I would not need a

Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra

pill. To try not to get a boner.

DEBBIE

But everyone gives you a boner.

JASON

Don't sell yourself short like

that. You give me a boner.

(whispers)

Barb doesn't give me a boner.

DEBBIE

Maybe things are just getting

stale. That's why maybe I work out

really hard. Maybe he'll be able to

get a boner again.

BARB

Why do you need to have sex, Deb?

Sex is the number one thing people

fight about.

BARB

JASON

DEBBIE

JASON

DEBBIE

10.

JASON

Yup.

DEBBIE

He doesn't seem happy.

JASON

Yeah, he is.

DEBBIE

No. He's lonely.

JASON

No, he's not.

DEBBIE

See, I think he has sad eyes.

JASON

Aw, you sweet little thing. He's

doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the

next lady. I can do it too, watch.

DEBBIE

I bet George Clooney is really

lonely. Just him and his pig.

JASON

You'd fuck him.

DEBBIE

I wouldn't.

JASON

So would you.

BARB

I would. I wouldn't feel it but-

JASON

You'd fuck him with your numb

vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's

thirteen inches, that's what you'd

find out.

DEBBIE

Do you think?

11.

BARRY

I mean that was idiotic. You have

to understand. That's like the one

thing you don't do is tell her you

used Viagra. I think that's even on

the warning label.

PETE

We're in one of those phases where

everything the other person says

just annoys the shit out of each

other. All the time. It's a blast.

BARRY

Don't worry about it. You just

gotta ride that out.

PETE

This sounds terrible but do you

ever wonder what it would be like

if, say, you were separated by

something bigger, like death. Like

her death?

BARRY

I have given it a fair amount of

thought.

PETE

Not in a painful way. Just quietly

slid into death. Like a gas leak.

BARRY

Absolutely. It has got to be

peaceful. I mean this is the mother

of your children.

PETE

I'd want it to be a peaceful --

just like, drift, into a coma, from

which she never awakens.

BARRY

Then you move on. Then you're a

widower.

PETE

That's just it. People love

widowers.

12.

BARRY

They love widowers. It's like the

polar opposite of divorced guys.

PETE

It's the best.

BARRY

It's like, oh, that poor widower.

You know. If I could only--

PETE

Somehow...

BARRY

...make him happy.

PETE

Somehow ease his pain.

BARRY

...cocksuck away his sadness.

PETE

Did you know that the Pixies did

this song about a Salvador Dali

short film called "Un Chien

Andalou"?

DEBBIE

This music doesn't make people

happy.

PETE

This song kicks off Doolittle, one

of the best albums of the last

thirty years. An important record.

DEBBIE

Look how angry you get while

listening to this.

(beat)

It's my birthday. You don't control

the radio on my birthday. I control

the radio on my birthday.

13.

CHARLOTTE

Sadie's watching Lost.

DEBBIE

Sadie, how many times have you

watched Lost this week?

SADIE

I've only watched eleven. I have

eight more and then I'm done.

PETE

How many are there?

SADIE

A hundred and fourteen?

PETE

Are you kidding me? You can't watch

over a hundred episodes of a show

in five weeks. It'll melt your

brain.

SADIE

It's not melting my brain, it's

blowing my mind.

DEBBIE

That's really bad, Sadie. You're

not allowed to do that.

SADIE

My relationship with Lost is not

your business. It's extremely

personal.

SADIE (CONT'D)

Stop it!

DEBBIE

Be nice to your sister. You guys

are going to cherish each other one

day.

SADIE

Stop it! Stop!

14.

PETE

It's your birthday, you don't need

to go to the store.

DEBBIE

I know, just five minutes. I think

Desi and Jodi are fighting.

PETE

All right, five minutes. But then

I'm pulling you out.

DEBBIE

Hi. How's Jodi treating you?

DESI

Jodi? Oh, Jodi's my new BFF. She's

like a little kitty cat. Sometimes

she comes and rubs up against my

leg.

JODI

You're a ball of shit.

DESI

She loves me.

DEBBIE

Huh.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Can you do inventory so that we can

do the sidewalk sale? And you

really need to pay attention to the

numbers because we have twelve

thousand dollars unaccounted for.

JODI

I think it's probably Desi. She's

been having a really hard time

using these simple computers.

(MORE)

15.

JODI (CONT'D)

It's because she's stupid. I think

she might be stealing.

DEBBIE

She's not stealing. She's our best

employee. She made nine grand last

month.

JODI

Well, how much did I make?

DEBBIE

You brought in twenty-two hundred.

JODI

That's not bad.

DEBBIE

Well, that's not that good. I mean,

I'm not comparing you, but you're

not as good.

PETE

(to Desi)

All right. See you.

PETE (CONT'D)

I don't think she's wearing

underwear.

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

It's all dark up there.

DEBBIE

What? Why are you looking?

PETE

I didn't mean to look, I just said,

`Hey- woah!' There it was.

DEBBIE

Maybe she's wearing dark underwear.

PETE

Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that

has a picture of a vagina painted

on it.

16.

DEBBIE

Stop looking.

DESI

Maybe some deep oranges and browns

and maybe dark greens? That would

really play up your features.

CUSTOMER

I'll just take out my AmEx and you

pick what stuff you think is good.

DEBBIE

Woo! Where's daddy?

SADIE

I think he went to poop.

DEBBIE

Pete!

DEBBIE

What are you doing?

PETE

Going to the bathroom.

DEBBIE

We're all downstairs waiting for

you. You've been up here for a

really long time now.

PETE

Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down

in a second.

17.

PETE

I've been flushing as I go.

DEBBIE

You're flushing as you go? Who

takes a half hour to go to the

bathroom?

PETE

(thinks for a second)

John Goodman.

PETE (CONT'D)

Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I

want to make that move!

PETE

You know, when I started this

label, my dream was to work with

musicians and bands whose music I

just admired so much. The person

that I thought, "My god, wouldn't

it be incredible to work with" was

Graham Parker. Tonight we have him.

Solo. Because we couldn't afford to

fly in The Rumour.

DEBBIE

It's just not my kind of music.

19.

PETE

Really. What is your kind of music?

DEBBIE

I like Lady Gaga.

PETE

Oh, god, of course you do.

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

Shallow dance music.

DEBBIE

It's not! It's fun, and it's about

release and sex and power.

PETE

You know, you don't have to like

it. It's really not for you, that's

fine.

DEBBIE

This is a job. This is not a hobby.

Can't you love him just as a hobby?

And sign a fifteen-year-old hot

girl so we can eat?

PETE

Graham Parker and The Rumour had

two albums in the Rolling Stone Top

500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of

`em. If I can just sell ten

thousand records to his hardcore

fan base, we're golden.

DEBBIE

(pause, then laughing)

The last of Graham Parker's fans

just died.

DEBBIE

Sadie. Sadie, what are you

listening to?

(MORE)

20.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Okay, this is music that makes

people happy. And this is what

people buy. Right, girls?

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Why did you take it off?

PETE

Now, something that really rocks.

PETE (CONT'D)

This is called good music. From

somebody's heart.

SADIE

This is bumming me out. This isn't

fun.

PETE

Just listen to these words, okay?

CHARLOTTE

I don't understand the words.

PETE

This is lyrics, this is poetry.

This is what is going to survive in

a hundred years.

DEBBIE

It just doesn't make people happy.

PETE

It makes me happy. I can dance to

it.

DEBBIE

You're the only one in the room

who's happy.

21.

PETE

Sometimes, I wish just one of you

had a dick.

CHARLOTTE

Well, we don't want one.

DEBBIE

(to Pete)

Is there something that you can do

to be helping me right now?

PETE

Yeah, I'm ready to help. Just tell

me what to do.

DEBBIE

Can you go get a lunch box or

something?

PETE

For me or for them?

SADIE

Charlotte! I've got a test!

CHARLOTTE

I'm coming! I'm coming!

SADIE

Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!

DEBBIE

Shhh!

22.

DEBBIE

Hi, any day now, huh?

PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT

Not really. Three more months!

BETH

Katie's dying for a play date.

Let's hook these two up.

DEBBIE

That would be great, I'll call you.

CHARLOTTE

No.

DEBBIE

"No" what?

CHARLOTTE

No.

DEBBIE

What? She's sweet.

CHARLOTTE

She's evil.

TEACHER

Hi. Listen, Charlotte really needs

to get here on time because she

needs the extra time to just settle

in.

DEBBIE

Oh. We are on time.

23.

TEACHER

Being on time means being early.

DEBBIE

Oh. Okay.

TEACHER

Well, it's nice to see you in

class. We'd like to see more of

you.

DEBBIE

I come to--

GRANDMA MOLLY

Hi Debbie!

DEBBIE

Hi, Grandma Molly.

GRANDMA MOLLY

How are you? I'm so happy about the

science fair. It's going very well

I heard. I love you. You look so

beautiful. Happy birthday! I just

learned it's your fortieth. Are you

forty?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

GRANDMA MOLLY

I remember when I was forty, and

then I blinked and there I was,

going to be ninety. My god, where

did it go? One day you're going to

blink, and you're going to be

ninety, and I won't be around to

see it. And that makes me very sad.

I'm telling you, I'm warning you.

Don't blink. Don't blink.

24.

ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

And then you missed the mortgage

payment, and that's the second

mortgage. You've got to tighten

your belt. You've got to go home,

sit down, look at your expenses,

come clean with Debbie.

PETE

Oh, god. I can't tell Debbie.

ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

You have to tell her, Pete.

PETE

She knows it's bad, but she has no

idea just how bad.

ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

If you sell the house, it'll really

buy you some time.

PETE

No. Debbie's not really into

selling the house.

ACCOUNTANT (O.C.)

As your business manager and your

friend, I can't recommend that.

(beat)

Hey, how funny would it be if I

bought your house?

PETE

Okay. Bye.

ACCOUNTANT (O.C)

Hang in there.

RONNIE

What are you doing?

CAT

I'm contextualizing him as one of

the great figures in rock history.

25.

RONNIE

CAT

PETE

RONNIE

CAT

RONNIE

CAT

RONNIE

CAT

RONNIE

PETE

26.

RONNIE

I finished.

PETE

Look. It's a retro label. That's

our niche. That's our market. It

costs money to break new bands, I

can't do that.

RONNIE

Oh, okay. And also you're the guy

who turned down Arcade Fire.

PETE

Everyone turned down Arcade Fire.

CAT

It's crazy, there are so many of

them!

PETE

We don't have the money to market a

new band. We just need to make

Graham seem relevant. Who is he

talking to?

CAT

Um, the Jewish Journal.

PETE

The Jewish Journal?

RONNIE

Apparently old Jews are the only

ones who still buy hard copies of

records. Because they don't like to

download music. Because they don't

know what downloading means.

INTERVIEWER

Why is this album different from

any other album?

GRAHAM

It isn't.

PETE

What is he wearing?

27.

CAT

It's a hat with the Oreo logo on

it.

PETE

Why?

CAT

I don't think he's being ironic, I

think he just really likes Oreos.

PETE

Look. The Paul Westerberg record

did okay. Frank Black did all

right. The Haircut 100, not so

much. We have to break this record.

Otherwise, we're not here next

year.

RONNIE

He's coming. Oreo man is coming.

GRAHAM

Hey guys, how are you?

RONNIE

Aren't cookies the best?

GRAHAM

Yeah. Jewish Journal guy loves the

record.

PETE

Great!

GRAHAM

Got a bit of a problem. Touch of

gout.

PETE

Gout?

GRAHAM

Yeah, my whole family, they all had

gout.

PETE

Jesus.

RONNIE

That's very unfortunate.

28.

GRAHAM

My auntie Queenie, she had a foot

like the size of a small pig. I've

got a photo of it.

RONNIE

I'd love to see that photo of that

gout foot.

GRAHAM

A couple of bunions as well.

RONNIE

Fuck.

GRAHAM

I've got to go to the podiatrist,

and I hope he can shoot me up with

something.

PETE

Yeah, well, let's get you to the

podiatrist.

CAT

Bye, Graham.

RONNIE

See you later, Graham. Good luck

with your gout!

GRAHAM

Rock and Roll, baby.

DEBBIE

The happiest period in people's

lives is from age forty to sixty.

So this is it. We're in it, right

now.

PETE

Says who?

DEBBIE

Says a lot of people, most people.

PETE

Huh.

31.

DEBBIE

And the other thing is your dad

stuff.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

The not letting him guilt trip you

all the time, because that puts a

lot of pressure on you, and the

whole family feels it. He's a grown

man, and he's not our

responsibility. And you're not

giving him money anymore, right?

PETE

No, I haven't been giving him money

for years, I told you.

DEBBIE

Can you please put that down?

DEBBIE

A lot of people are RSVP-ing to

your birthday party.

PETE

You sure you don't want to just do

a joint birthday party?

DEBBIE

No.

PETE

We always used to.

DEBBIE

No.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's

stealing?

PETE

Are you serious?

32.

DEBBIE

Yes.

PETE

How much?

DEBBIE

Twelve thousand dollars.

PETE

Oh, god. And Desi's taking it?

DEBBIE

Well, I don't know. That's what

Jodi said.

PETE

We really need the store to work.

DEBBIE

It is. Don't put that kind of

pressure on me.

PETE

That's not what I mean.

DEBBIE

Are you nervous about money? Are we

okay?

PETE

Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up

because she's clearly earning so

much more than any other employee

we have.

DEBBIE

Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire

her. We're barely breaking even

with her.

PETE

That's why we have to keep her.

DEBBIE

Look at this, she's making out with

somebody.

33.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Is she screwing him??

PETE

That might be like a dry hump.

DEBBIE

Look at the position of her skirt.

PETE

That's too grainy to know for sure.

Oh my god, this is the middle of

the day. Customers could be in

there.

DEBBIE

At least she's getting some.

PETE

What did you say? "At least she's

getting some"?

DEBBIE

Yes.

PETE

What are you talking about? We had

sex the other night. You have to

give me a little credit for that.

DEBBIE

It's not about credit. We need to

have more passion. Like this.

PETE

That's not passion.

DEBBIE

It looks like passion to me.

PETE

What--

PETE (CONT'D)

What is she doing?

DEBBIE

Oh my god. Don't do that!

34.

PETE

What am I doing?

DEBBIE

Don't fart in the bed!

PETE

I'm not, it's the springs.

DEBBIE

This is why we never have sex.

That's disgusting. You're gross.

PETE

I don't know what you're talking

about.

CHARLOTTE

(singing)

Sadie. Sadie, Sadie! Sadie, Sadie!

SADIE

Charlotte. I'm doing my homework.

CHARLOTTE

Okay, watch this. There's a haunted

cow back here, and I'm pretty sure

it does not have milk!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

Did you see that? They took me

away!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

You're no fun. You never want to

play.

SADIE

Charlotte. How many times do I have

to tell you--

35.

CHARLOTTE

(singing)

Sadie! Sadie, Sadie! Is boring!

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

You're so mean since your body got

weird.

SADIE

Close the door.

DR. BOWE

Did I tell you that my son is going

to Stanford?

PETE

No, that's great.

DR. BOWE

Great for us and great for him.

Cough again. Everything looks good.

PETE

Your face is close to my face.

36.

TECHNICIAN

Descending colon. I'm about four

feet in right now.

DEBBIE

(laughing)

That's what he said.

DENTIST

Do you grind your teeth?

DEBBIE

I grind all night.

DENTIST

I think we need to turn the gas

down.

DEBBIE

Turn it up!

DENTIST

No, we're going to turn it down.

DEBBIE

Turn it up!

PETE

Do you have to breathe right on my

neck?

DR. BOWE

Sorry.

37.

DR. PELLIGRINO

What are you all doing for

Christmas?

DEBBIE

I don't know.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Do you have a tree and everything?

DEBBIE

Yes.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Isn't that fun. Get in the spirit--

NURSE #1

Hi, sorry I just have one quick

question. On your form you said you

were born in 1974, but your paper

said 1972. I just need to know

which it is.

DEBBIE

Oh. It's 1974.

NURSE #2

Because on your last form you said

that you were born in 1975.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Didn't you tell me you were born in

1976?

DEBBIE

No. That's funny.

NURSE #2

So you want to go with 1974?

DEBBIE

I'm not going to "go" with 1974, it

is 1974.

38.

NURSE #2

Okay. Just remember to write 1974

every time.

DR. PELLIGRINO

It's okay. It's 1976.

DEBBIE

I lie about my age, okay?

DR. PELLIGRINO

Okay.

DEBBIE

Okay? Okay? Okay?!

DR. PELLIGRINO

You're tightening up.

DEBBIE

Oh my gosh.

DR. PELLIGRINO

I know how old you are. By counting

the rings! Little gyno joke.

DEBBIE

What are you doing?

PETE

Getting ready to go for my ride.

DEBBIE

You want a blow job?

PETE

Yeah. Why?

DEBBIE

I really want a cigarette right

now.

PETE

Well, happy to help.

39.

SADIE

Charlotte, where is my backpack?

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Hello?

PETE

Mom's busy!

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Why are you locking the door? Mom!

CHARLOTTE

What's going on in there?

SADIE

Mom, I can't be late for school, I

have a test!

PETE (O.C.)

Mommy can't talk right now!

SADIE (O.C.)

This isn't funny, Mom. I need to

go.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Mom, let me in!

SADIE

That's not going to help.

40.

PETE (O.C.)

Put on your shoes. We'll meet you

in the car.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Sadie hurt me!

SADIE (O.C.)

I didn't!

PETE

Hit her back!

SADIE (O.C.)

She's faking!

CHARLOTTE

(crying)

I'm not!

PETE (O.S.)

Go downstairs.

DEBBIE

(shouting to kids)

Stop crying!

PETE

(to kids)

Stop crying!

DEBBIE

Stop it!

PETE

God damn it!

41.

SADIE

(banging on the door)

Open the door! Open it!

DEBBIE

Forget it.

PETE

No. Don't forget it. Don't forget

it. Don't. Oh, god.

LARRY

Hey, Boychik.

LARRY (CONT'D)

That's the eleven o'clock from

London.

(yells up at the plane)

Drop something valuable, you shit.

(back to Pete)

How are you?

PETE

That's loud.

LARRY

Every eight minutes, buddy.

LARRY

You look pretty good. Your hair is

different.

PETE

Yeah, I'm growing it out.

42.

LARRY

I'd get it cut.

TRIPLET #1

Daddy, you never play with me.

LARRY

I do but right now look who I'm

talking to. It's your brother.

TRIPLET #1

You don't look like my brother.

LARRY

I told you honey, that's because of

the egg donor. Remember?

TRIPLET #1

I came from a test tube.

PETE

How's business?

LARRY

It's not good. Nobody wants

curtains. They think of it like a

luxury. It's not a luxury. You need

shade, you need privacy. Who wants

to have other people watch you

fuck?

PETE

I know how you feel. You know my

business is going through some

growing pains right now.

TRIPLET #2

Daddy come play with us.

LARRY

Be careful, don't jump on Daddy.

Remember, Daddy has high blood

what?

TRIPLETS

Blood pressure.

LARRY

That's right. Can you go outside

without me for a little bit?

(MORE)

43.

LARRY (CONT'D)

All right? Do the Three Stooges

routine you were practicing.

LARRY (CONT'D)

I can't tell them apart. I swear to

god. I need tattoos.

PETE

Look, I wanted to talk to you about

scaling back a little bit. You

know, Deb and I are thinking about

selling the house.

LARRY

I think that house is more than you

need. I think it was too big of a

purchase when you made it.

PETE

Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going to

have to make some changes. Going to

have to cut back.

LARRY

What do you mean?

PETE

With you.

LARRY

Oh. I'm sorry, what?

PETE

I can't lend you any more money.

LARRY

No, that's a bad idea. That's not

the way to cut back. I have three

children, here.

PETE

What about Claire? Why can't she

get a job?

LARRY

Claire takes care of your brothers.

What do you want her to do? If she

goes to work, then I've got to hire

somebody.

44.

PETE

Well you've got to figure something

out because I can't do it.

LARRY

Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them?

Come on, we'll kill two of them.

I'll keep the best one. Really, it

will save us both a lot of trouble.

LARRY

Line up! Line up for murder! Come

on! Who wants to be killed?

TRIPLET #1

I do!

LARRY

Okay, we're eliminating one, we're

cheaper already.

TRIPLET #2

Murder me!

LARRY

Boom, dead. You're dead.

TRIPLET #2

I'm dead!

LARRY

All right, the kids are murdered.

That will save us some money.

PETE

Why would you have three kids,

anyway? I mean, you're sixty years

old. You have no money.

LARRY

Because Claire wanted a baby. If we

didn't at least try, she would have

left me. She was forty-five years

old. Nobody thought it would take.

(MORE)

45.

LARRY (CONT'D)

The doctor when we were doing in

vitro was winking at me like,

"Don't worry, don't worry." We were

very unlucky. And now we have these

three beautiful children... Come

on, I've got to tell you something.

PETE

What?

LARRY

Your mother wanted you aborted.

PETE

Oh, Jesus Christ.

LARRY

It's the truth. It was the

seventies. We were twenty-two years

old. That's what everybody did. You

did some blow, had sex, had an

abortion.

PETE

Really.

LARRY

Yes. We were on the way to the

doctor's office. I said, "Let's

stop, have a pizza, talk about it,

if you still want to do it after

lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved

your life. But don't give me money.

Because I'm not worth it.

PETE

So how much do I owe you for saving

my life?

LARRY

I don't have a number. You just

keep giving like you're giving.

CLAIRE

Oh, hi Pete.

(to Larry)

Why aren't you playing with kids?

46.

LARRY

We were playing with them all day.

Pete's just talking to me about his

fortieth birthday party... Whatever

I can do to help.

CLAIRE

Okay. Did you feed them?

LARRY

I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed

them. Who wants tuna with a side of

jet fuel?

DEBBIE

Hi, I'm looking for my dad, an

older man?

OLIVER

So how's Sony treating Pete?

DEBBIE

Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He

went out on his own. Now he's able

to focus on the artists that he's

really passionate about.

OLIVER

How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw

her she was throwing her Cheerios

on the floor. What a mess.

DEBBIE

She just got her period.

OLIVER

Well. I guess she's not a little

baby anymore.

DEBBIE

It would be nice to see more of

each other.

47.

OLIVER

Well, we can certainly arrange for

that. I'd love to see the girls.

DEBBIE

That would be nice. Do you have a

good day?

OLIVER

I would say the weekends, but our

weekends are hell. Soccer

competitions, kids exams. I mean,

we're both so busy. I have young

children, you have young children.

I don't think we should judge

ourselves too harshly about that.

DEBBIE

I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're

here. I think this is a good start

and that if we can spend more time

together, it would be nice.

OLIVER

It would be nice.

(pause)

Do you want to see pictures of the

kids?

OLIVER (CONT'D)

This is Kell, my son.

DEBBIE

He's handsome. He's thirteen?

OLIVER

Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my

daughter, she's a real

perfectionist. A lot like you.

That's the whole gang at Cabo.

(pause)

Will you excuse me, dear? I've got

to use the restroom. Be right back.

48.

DEBBIE

Daddy and I are making some changes

so that we can be happier and

healthier, and we're starting with

this meal that I prepared.

PETE

I think it looks great.

DEBBIE

Doesn't it look good?

PETE

What is that, grilled cheeses?

DEBBIE

No, baked tofu. It's actually

really tasty. And the lettuce is so

fresh and tasty that you forget how

good lettuce tastes on its own

without dressing.

PETE

Yeah, dressing always gets in the

way of the natural taste of the

lettuce.

DEBBIE

And another thing we've decided is

to cut back on all of the

electronics we use. What we're

going to do is get rid of the wi-fi

and only use the computer from

eight to eight-thirty at night.

SADIE

How are we going to go on the

computer?

DEBBIE

We're going to have a hard line in

the kitchen.

PETE

Yeah, we'll supervise that.

SADIE

You can't do this. You can't take

away the wi-fi.

49.

CHARLOTTE

(from behind her iPhone)

DEBBIE

SADIE

DEBBIE

PETE

SADIE

CHARLOTTE

PETE

DEBBIE

SADIE

DEBBIE

SADIE

50.

DEBBIE

When I was a kid we used to build

tree houses and play with sticks.

SADIE

Nobody plays with sticks.

PETE

You and Charlotte can have a

lemonade stand.

DEBBIE

Play Kick the Can.

PETE

Look for dead bodies.

DEBBIE

It's fun.

PETE

Get a tire and then take a stick

and run down the street with it.

SADIE

Nobody does that crap. It's 2012.

DEBBIE

You don't need technology.

CHARLOTTE

No technology!

DEBBIE

Charlotte, put that down.

SADIE

I don't need to be monitored all

the time on the computer. I don't

do anything bad.

DEBBIE

Nobody said you were bad.

SADIE

I don't do things I'm not supposed

to. I don't illegally download

music. I don't look at porn like

Wendy.

51.

DEBBIE

She is up to no good. She's not

allowed to come over here anymore.

CHARLOTTE

What's porn?

PETE

No, she said "corn."

DEBBIE

This isn't turning out the way I

wanted it to.

SADIE

I'm not hungry.

DEBBIE

No computer.

PETE

Listen to your mom.

SADIE

I need to use it for my homework.

PETE

She's outplaying us.

DEBBIE

I know. She's tough.

DEBBIE

This is the best birthday present.

PETE

It's good to get away, you know? We

haven't been to Laguna without the

kids in years.

DEBBIE

I know!

52.

PETE

If we're happy, they're happy.

DEBBIE

I mean I can't take it. With the

hormones, and the crying, and "do

my homework"...

PETE

Them's little bitches.

DEBBIE

Them's lil' bitches! Bugging us for

shit all the time. And they never

appreciate anything.

PETE

God no. They're selfish assholes.

DEBBIE

(laughs)

Aw, I feel bad. I love them.

PETE

I know.

DEBBIE

I miss them already. Should we go

home?

PETE

Nah.

53.

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

DEBBIE

PETE

54.

DEBBIE

Because you'd be so weak and sweet,

and I could take care of you but

while killing you.

PETE

See? You know what I love about us?

You can still surprise me. I

figured for sure you'd knock me out

with one fell swoop. But you would

extend it over a series of months.

DEBBIE

Have you ever thought about killing

me?

PETE

Oh, yeah.

DEBBIE

Really?

PETE

Sure.

DEBBIE

How would you do it?

PETE

Wood chipper.

DEBBIE

A wood chipper?

PETE

Did you see Fargo?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Wow. That's a bad plan. The

cupcakes is a way better plan.

PETE

It is. You know what? I won't

murder you.

DEBBIE

Aw. I love you.

55.

PETE

I love you too... Hey. You know

what I brought?

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

A medical marijuana cookie. Ben

gave it to me last Christmas.

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

Chocolate chip koo-kie.

DEBBIE

Should we do it?

PETE

Let's eat the cookie, and then

we'll order a bunch of

cheeseburgers. Let's order the

entire room service menu.

DEBBIE

Just get all of it. You deserve it.

You really do.

PETE

Wouldn't you rather have me around

for less years and I'm incredibly

happy than longer and miserable?

DEBBIE

Yes, and I just realized that right

now. Go get the cookie!

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Should we watch porn when we eat

the cookie?

PETE

Should we get a block of porn?

DEBBIE

I don't think we need twenty-four

hours of porn.

56.

PETE

Yeah, but you know, two porns cost

about as much as a block.

DEBBIE

I think that's too much porn.

PETE

We don't have to watch it all, but

for the value it makes sense.

DEBBIE

How much are we supposed to eat?

PETE

I don't know. I think like six or

seven cookies, right?

DEBBIE

Plus, it's old. It probably has

lost some of its-

PETE

Potency?

DEBBIE

We should have sex. More.

PETE

I mean, girls have it so easy. You

just show up with your sexual

organs and you're good to go. All

the pressure is on the guy.

DEBBIE

It's true.

PETE

And I look at guys, like I look at

a guy like Prince, and you know

that guy fucks. I know I don't fuck

like Prince. Prince can fuck. I

fuck more like David Schwimmer.

DEBBIE

You do.

57.

PETE

I fuck like Ross from Friends.

PETE

How does he do it? The floating

spoon.

PETE (CONT'D)

Check it out. My dick and balls.

I'm going to eat my own dick!

PETE (CONT'D)

I ate my dick!

PETE (CONT'D)

I think this room has rodents. I

just saw it!

PETE (CONT'D)

Have you seen my starfish? Where

did I put my starfish?

58.

DEBBIE

I'm going to deep throat this

eclair.

PETE

I want to make out with you so bad.

PETE

That was nice.

DEBBIE

That was nice.

SADIE

Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got

an ear infection again.

JODI

I didn't know what to do.

PETE

(to Debbie)

We're home.

DEBBIE

Are you okay? What's the matter?

CHARLOTTE

I just want to rip my ear off, it

hurts so much.

59.

DEBBIE

(to Pete)

I told you the pediatrician didn't

know what he was talking about.

PETE

Oh, come on. You can't blame it on

our doctor. Ear infections are

common in little kids.

DEBBIE

Not in kids over six years old.

We're going to the Eastern doctor.

PETE

If she's in this much pain, we

should call a real doctor.

DEBBIE

Are you kidding right now?

PETE

Okay.

DOCTOR SEDUKU

What we should do is easy and

simple. No more dairy, no more

wheat, no more sugar.

DEBBIE

Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.

PETE

(mutters)

What the fuck is left? Sorry. Isn't

everything sugar, wheat and dairy?

DOCTOR SEDUKU

She can have vegetables and

f-r-ruits.

PETE

Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits.

DOCTOR SEDUKU

Fr-r-ruits, yes.

60.

PETE

Any kind of fr-r-ruits?

DOCTOR SEDUKU

Mangos, pineapple...

PETE

It isn't like there are safe fr-r-

ruits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits.

DOCTOR SEDUKU

No, no.

PETE

What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries?

Can we do something like that?

DOCTOR SEDUKU

Are you okay? Would you like to

come on the table?

PETE

I'm okay.

DEBBIE

Why don't you go on the table?

PETE

No.

DEBBIE

Why don't you go on the table? It

looks like you need to get on the

table.

PETE

I don't want to get on the table.

DEBBIE

Pete!

61.

DEBBIE

What are you doing?

PETE

I need you to look at something. In

my butt.

DEBBIE

Why?

PETE

I think I've got something in

there, and I'm not limber enough to

see. I need you to look at it. I

might have like an anal fissure or

a hemorrhoid or a worm or

something.

DEBBIE

What are you doing with your phone?

PETE

Trying to take pictures of it, so I

can compare it to something on

Google.

DEBBIE

Can we just keep like a small shred

of mystery in our relationship?

PETE

Look, I saw you have two babies,

okay? Seriously, I need you to get

all up in that.

DEBBIE

I do not want to investigate your

anus.

PETE

It's payback time.

62.

DEBBIE

It's a hemorrhoid.

PETE

Thank you. Now erase that from your

memory.

DEBBIE

Where did she get those clothes?

Those are expensive.

JODI

Where do you think? I don't want

this to sound harsh, but everything

that comes out of her mouth is a

lie. Everything that comes into it

is a dick.

DEBBIE

Everything that goes in is dicks?

JODI

A dick.

DEBBIE

Don't say that.

JODI

I'm sorry, I'm just being

protective of the store.

DEBBIE

I'm going to go talk to her.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Hey Desi. Is that your new Acura

out front?

DESI

Uh, yeah.

DEBBIE

It's so nice. Do you love it?

DESI

Well, I mean, it's not a fucking

Porsche, but it'll do for now.

63.

DEBBIE

Hey Desi, would you mind wearing

some of the clothes we have in the

store?

DESI

Yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

DESI (CONT'D)

Good?

DESI (CONT'D)

You know, I actually made this one

myself.

DEBBIE

Did you?

DESI

Yeah. I did the tiger on a piece of

paper separately, and then I

transferred it to the t-shirt.

DEBBIE

Wow. So you stenciled on the tiger?

DESI

I drew it on a piece of paper, and

then I transferred the drawing to

the t-shirt.

DEBBIE

You have an amazing body.

DESI

Really?

DEBBIE

Yes. Are those real?

DESI

My boobs? Yeah... Do you want to

touch them?

DEBBIE

Really?

DESI

Touch `em!

64.

DEBBIE

Okay.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Wow. Jesus. I mean they really are

amazing. That's firm, for real.

They're like a memory mattress.

Like Tempurpedic, you know? They

look amazing. My kids just sucked

the meat right out of mine.

DESI

No. There's some meat in there.

DEBBIE

Since I had kids, my boobs are just

gone. They didn't even say goodbye.

They just left.

DESI

By the time I'm forty, these are

going to go National Geographic on

me.

DEBBIE

I feel bad about myself right now.

REALTOR (O.C.)

I think this is a really good offer

on the house.

PETE

We expected more. I mean, I know

it's a bad market but that's still

way under what we were looking for.

REALTOR (O.C.)

I know, but based on the market,

it's like you're gaining money.

Because it's so much more than what

you deserve. But these people are

from Iran and they don't really

know that they're offering too

much. Is there any chance that

Debbie will go for it?

65.

PETE

I doubt it. I don't know.

REALTOR (O.C.)

There's a lot of inventory out

there. What's her problem?

PETE

She has unrealistic expectations.

LARRY

Did you miss me Travis?

TRIPLET #1

It's Jack!

LARRY

Hey, Jack.

TRIPLET #1

My daddy doesn't know my name.

CHARLOTTE

Can I go show them my crystals

before they leave?

DEBBIE

Yeah, really quick.

LARRY

Go play with your tiny uncles.

(to Debbie)

So, what are you doing, spring

cleaning?

DEBBIE

I'm getting rid of everything in

the house that has gluten or sugar.

66.

LARRY

DEBBIE

LARRY

DEBBIE

LARRY

SADIE

DEBBIE

SADIE

DEBBIE

LARRY

DEBBIE

WENDY

LARRY

DEBBIE

LARRY

DEBBIE

67.

LARRY

The kids eat grass. This is fine.

SADIE

Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever

she wants.

WENDY

My mom's pretty cool about it as

long as I finish my homework.

DEBBIE

Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the

cool one. But the rules are just

different in our house.

SADIE

But I get better grades than Wendy.

WENDY

She does. She's so smart.

LARRY

Let me just grab the candy worms.

SADIE

Your rules are ridiculous.

DEBBIE

Don't sass me.

SADIE

I'm only sassing you because you're

throwing out all the food in our

house and I'm freaking starving.

You're being stupid.

DEBBIE

Wendy, can you go stand in the

other room, please?

WENDY

Yeah.

SADIE

(whispers)

Mom.

DEBBIE

Give me your iPhone now.

68.

LARRY

The nougat things are good.

SADIE

I have all my contacts in there.

DEBBIE

Okay, if you don't give me your

phone right now, then I'm going to

have to take away your phone and

your computer.

SADIE

Jesus Christ--

DEBBIE

That's it.

SADIE

I need my computer to do homework.

DEBBIE

No phone, no computer.

SADIE

This is B.S. This is a bunch of F-

ing S. You're acting like a B.

LARRY

Kids! Time to go!

DEBBIE

You go to your room right now.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

(calling after her)

You are not allowed to use iPhone,

iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

Pandora, or Spotify!

LARRY

She's a little pip. Just like her

mommy. So I might have a job

tomorrow, at least I'm going to go

try to give an estimate. Do you

mind taking the kids for a couple

hours?

69.

DEBBIE

(conflicted)

Okay.

LARRY

This is nice. You and I don't spend

enough time together, do we?

DEBBIE

We spend enough time together.

LARRY

We do?

DEBBIE

It's quality time.

LARRY

Then we do. I'll go with what you

think.

DEBBIE

What else did they say?

PETE

Some kid named Joseph--

DEBBIE

I know Joseph.

PETE

You do? He's making a "Hot or Not"

list.

DEBBIE

What?

PETE

So, Sadie said, "That's so   lame and

immature that you're doing   that."

And then Joseph says, "Yo,   girl.

We're just having some fun   so don't

be a bitch, yo."

DEBBIE

That is not nice.

70.

PETE

So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me

a bitch." And Joseph said, "I

didn't call you a bitch, I said

don't act like a bitch. And by the

way you're in the `Not Hot'

column."

DEBBIE

Who made him the judge of hot?

PETE

Do you realize what that could do

to her self-esteem?

DEBBIE

What a little fuckhead. I'll kill

him.

PETE

So then Sadie said, "You're in the

jackass column. I've got to go. I'm

bored of you."

DEBBIE

That is cool. That's taking the

high road.

PETE

For some reason, there's an

emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.

DEBBIE

I wonder what that means.

PETE

I don't think it means anything, I

think it's just adorable.

DEBBIE

Aww. She's a good girl. She was

polite, and she stood up for

herself.

PETE

That's pretty cool.

PETE (CONT'D)

What?

DEBBIE

Shit. I thought she was coming in.

71.

PETE

Oh my god, that scared me to death.

DEBBIE

If she caught us, she would kill

us.

PETE

I've got to make a call.

PETE

(whispering loudly)

We sold how many?

RONNIE (O.C.)

Six hundred and twelve album

downloads.

PETE

Wait a minute. There are no zeros

after that?

RONNIE (O.C.)

There are zeros, but all of them

are before six hundred and twelve.

There are none after.

PETE

How is that even possible?

RONNIE (O.C.)

Out of three hundred million

Americans, six hundred and twelve

people chose to download the album.

You could personally call everyone

who bought this record.

PETE

We're fucked! Here's the deal. I

want you to meet me tomorrow

morning at eight o'clock. I want a

list of at least thirty ideas of

what we can do to change this.

(MORE)

72.

PETE (CONT'D)

We have to change this. I started a

record label because I couldn't get

a job, so I have no other options.

DEBBIE

What financial problems?

ACCOUNTANT

Well, for one thing, you were

right, you are missing about ten

thousand dollars from the store.

And then, Pete's record not selling

well.

DEBBIE

I thought we weren't supposed to

hear for three weeks?

ACCOUNTANT

We heard.

DEBBIE

You heard.

ACCOUNTANT

And they're bad. You know, it's

that, and it's the money that he's

been lending to his father, that's

creating a strain.

DEBBIE

How much have we lent him?

ACCOUNTANT

Eighty thousand.

DEBBIE

Did you say "eight thousand" or

"eighty thousand"?

73.

ACCOUNTANT

Eighty thousand, over the past

couple of years. And then you

missed the mortgage payment--

DEBBIE

On the house?

ACCOUNTANT

And you missed the rental on the

office.

DEBBIE

Does Pete know that?

ACCOUNTANT

Oh, yeah. We're on the phone all

the time. Look, I know you're going

through a hard time, and I want you

guys to know that we're here for

you, okay? Anything you guys need,

that's why we're here. We're here

for times like this.

DEBBIE

What are you going to do?

ACCOUNTANT

There's not much I can do.

PETE

What are you doing?

RONNIE

I'm drawing the album cover for Van

Halen's Diver Down.

PETE

If you spent a little bit more time

focusing on Graham Parker instead

of drawing album covers, I wouldn't

be in this predicament.

RONNIE

I'm focused on Graham Parker.

PETE

You're supposed to help me with

him!

(MORE)

74.

PETE (CONT'D)

You're supposed to call the

companies, you're supposed to get

people to the show!

RONNIE

I've done everything I can, Pete.

You had me pushing around a corpse.

It was like being in fucking

Weekend at Graham's.

PETE

What should we do? I'm out of

ideas.

RONNIE

You fly in The Rumour. I can't sell

a reunion concert without the band.

It's ridiculous.

PETE

With what? I can't afford it.

RONNIE

You put this on yourself. You

wanted the responsibility, take it

on the chin, and stop acting like a

bitch.

PETE

What did you call me?

RONNIE

Chin.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

Pete -- wait. I have an apartment,

I have health insurance, I have car

payments. I have responsibilities.

PETE

Don't talk to me about

responsibilities. I have a life. I

have a family. I can't afford to

sit in my apartment getting high,

jerking off, and then going to

Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in

the morning.

RONNIE

That's not even the order that

happens in!

75.

PETE

I have everything to lose here.

Everything.

RONNIE

Yes. Because you spent thousands of

dollars on shit we don't need. You

really need to spend thirty

thousand dollars on a fucking neon

sign, dude? Which is inside? It's

not even outside. We know where we

work.

PETE

If you want to sign a band, you

have to look like you're the real

deal.

RONNIE

(to Cat)

Princess Labia, how much is it to

fly The Rumour in?

CAT

It's twelve thousand.

RONNIE

Twelve thousand dollars!

PETE

You know what? Fine. Fly in The

Rumour. Put it on my AmEx.

DEBBIE

No, you said it was impossible.

DR. PELLIGRINO

I don't think I said it was

impossible.

DEBBIE

Yeah.

DR. PELLIGRINO

I usually don't say impossible. I

like to leave some wiggle room.

76.

DEBBIE

You said that my fibroid was like a

giant boulder, like the one from

the Indiana Jones movies blocking

up my uterus.

DR. PELLIGRINO

And I need to stop using that

reference of Indiana Jones. I think

that's not appropriate when talking

about the reproductive system.

DEBBIE

It's okay.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Anyway, somehow the Eastern

medicine has worked and the fibroid

has dissipated.

DEBBIE

That's great.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and

somehow it allowed you to get

pregnant.

DEBBIE

What?

DR. PELLIGRINO

You're going to have your third

baby. Congratulations.

DEBBIE

No.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Yes.

DR. PELLIGRINO (CONT'D)

Would you like some water?

DEBBIE

That's good news. Another baby, at

forty.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Debbie?

77.

DEBBIE

I am thrilled. And Pete is going to

be so happy.

DR. PELLIGRINO

So, you're okay?

DEBBIE

What a relief. I can finally relax

now, you know? I'm so happy, I

really am. It's good.

DR. PELLIGRINO

Great. Great.

PETE

Hey, why are you in a bathrobe?

It's the middle of the afternoon.

LARRY

I took a late shower. Why are you

busting my balls? Look, I'm sorry

about the record. You're going

through financial shit. This is

what I live with. This is a

horrible time in human history.

What is that?

PETE

Something that might help both of

our situations.

78.

PETE (CONT'D)

LARRY

PETE

LARRY

PETE

LARRY

PETE

LARRY

PETE

LARRY

79.

PETE

I'll see you at my party.

LARRY

What should I bring? You want wine

or something?

PETE

No. Don't buy wine with my money

and give it to me at my party.

LARRY

That's mean.

PETE

I love you. Bye.

LARRY

All right. Bye... How do I call

eBay?

DEBBIE

She's so cute. She's so tall.

PETE

I know. How did that happen?

DEBBIE

Do you ever wish we had a bigger

family?

PETE

No, never for a second. Never.

DEBBIE

Never?

PETE

Never. I love what we have. One? A

breeze. Two? Brutal. Three? Put a

bullet in my head.

80.

PETE (CONT'D)

I think about that gray-haired

pregnant lady from school and I

just feel bad for her. And I feel

bad for the kid. Can you imagine?

All the other little kids, "Where's

your mommy?" "Oh, she's the one

sitting in that scooter eating a

soft cracker." Kids don't want to

have old parents. You know, it

would also be nice for us to spend

some time apart. Kind of rediscover

who we are individually. It would

be so great to not see you for like

a chunk of time so that I could

really just miss you. Remember when

we used to miss each other?

DEBBIE

Hey!

JOSEPH

Yo, sup?

DEBBIE

I'm Sadie's mom.

JOSEPH

Sadie...?

DEBBIE

Sadie, the one you chat with on the

internet?

JOSEPH

Nah, man. That ain't me.

DEBBIE

Well, it was you, I saw your

picture. Did you make a "Hot" list

and not put Sadie on the "Hot"

list?

JOSEPH

She was not on my list, no.

81.

DEBBIE

You know what I'm going to do? I'm

going to make my own "Hot" list,

and you know what? You're on the

"Not Hot" list. How does that feel?

JOSEPH

It doesn't bother me. I'm

comfortable with the way I am.

DEBBIE

Maybe you shouldn't be so

comfortable with yourself. You know

why? You look like a miniature Tom

Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You

think that haircut's cool? It's

not. It looks like you put your

Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You

still comfortable with yourself?

Why are you wearing a tank top?

Huh? So you can show off your bald

pits, you little hairless wonder?

Cool tank top, man. So next time

you think about writing something

nasty on my daughter's Facebook

page, just remember me. Remember

me. I will come down here, and I

will fuck you up.

JOSEPH

Okay, I'm sorry.

DEBBIE

Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying?

JOSEPH

Just let me go.

DEBBIE

I'm sorry. I'm not in my right

head.

JOSEPH

I understand. My mom is going

through menopause, too. It's a hard

time.

DEBBIE

What did you say?

82.

JOSEPH

You're going through menopause?

DEBBIE

I'm not going through menopause!

I'm not going to go through

menopause for twenty years. I'm

pregnant you little bitch. God damn

it!

DEBBIE

I'm going out to coffee with Desi

to find out if she's stealing from

us.

PETE

I've got the Graham Parker concert.

Who's gonna watch the kids?

DEBBIE

I don't know. Figure it out.

DEBBIE

I just wanted to talk. Maybe we

could go to a coffee house or

something?

DESI

You want coffee? This place has

coffee. They have all kinds of

drinks.

83.

DESI

What sport do you guys play?

HOCKEY PLAYER

We play hockey.

DESI

Oh, I like hockey.

DEBBIE

Who do you guys play for?

HOCKEY PLAYER

We play for the Philadelphia

Flyers.

DEBBIE

You guys are all from Philadelphia?

HOCKEY PLAYER

No, actually none of us are.

DESI

Do you guys still have all of your

teeth?

HOCKEY PLAYER #2

Well, I've got all my teeth, except

for these ones.

HOCKEY PLAYER #2 (CONT'D)

Want to try them on?

DESI

Do I look sexy?

HOCKEY PLAYER #3

They definitely look way better on

her than they do on you.

DEBBIE

So, should we go to the quiet area?

84.

HOCKEY PLAYERS

No, no.

HOCKEY PLAYER #4

Where are you going?

DEBBIE

We kind of have to have a little

business meeting tonight.

HOCKEY PLAYER

Business meeting? You have to

celebrate with us. We won tonight.

DESI

I want to party with these winners,

come on Deb.

HOCKEY PLAYER #4

Come dance with us.

DEBBIE

(thinks about it)

Okay. Let's fucking dance! Yeah!

PETE

Thank you so much for coming, this

is so exciting! For the first time

in over thirty years, Graham Parker

and The Rumour.

PETE (CONT'D)

(to Ronnie)

Where are his fans? Where are they?

RONNIE

It's hard to watch a band when you

know all of them remember D-Day.

PETE

What's press turnout like?

RONNIE

Are you serious? Nobody came.

85.

PETE

Nobody is here?

RONNIE

Oh, the guy from Green Day is here.

PETE

Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him.

He's a fan.

RONNIE

You've got to get a photo of the

two of them.

PETE

No, he says he doesn't want to do

any press, he's just watching the

show.

RONNIE

Oh, how punk rock of him. "I don't

like photographs."

(to Billie Joe)

Grow up, Green Day!

BILLIE JOE

Shut up, Tom Selleck.

JAY

I wouldn't call them classically

good dance moves, but you left it

all out there. You're a blast to

dance with.

DEBBIE

Thank you.

86.

JAY

DEBBIE

JAY

I hope this doesn't come off as

super cheesy, but I think you're a

very rare find.

DEBBIE

Thank you.

JAY

And I would totally do sex with

you.

PETE

(to the band)

That was spectacular guys, really

well done.

(to Graham)

Hey, Graham.

GRAHAM

Pete! How are you, man?

PETE

Well, the first numbers came in.

GRAHAM

Happy? How's it looking?

PETE

About half of your last record.

GRAHAM

Ah, so you were expecting it to

sell. They never sell anymore. They

used to sell. But now they don't.

I'm not a sexy sixteen-year-old

girl.

PETE

But I wanted to sell it. It's such

a good record. I feel like I let

you down.

GRAHAM

No, I'm going to be fine. My

overheads are so low. I just got a

song in Glee.

(MORE)

88.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

Guy in the wheelchair is going to

sing it to the Asian girl, I

believe. I don't know, I've never

seen the show, but that's what I'm

told. Secret is, make sure you have

a small nut. That's the key to

life.

PETE

Graham, I don't have small nuts,

all right? I have big nuts. And I

need to provide for them.

BILLIE JOE

Graham, hey, what's up?

GRAHAM

Billie!

BILLIE JOE

How you doing, man? Great show. I'm

inspired. I want to write a song

right now.

GRAHAM

Inspired, huh? That inspires me.

BILLIE JOE

Let's go get a drink.

GRAHAM

Let's get a drink.

BILLIE JOE

(to Pete)

You coming?

PETE

No. I'm fine. You guys go.

Congratulations on Glee.

BILLIE JOE

You got a song on Glee? That's

killer, man. That's so much money,

that's good for all of us.

89.

DEBBIE

Why did you put that guy's teeth in

your mouth? That's so gross. He was

dirty.

DESI

No, he was wearing a tie.

DEBBIE

That's true.

DESI

When I kissed him, I felt his

little tiny teeth nubs with my

tongue.

DEBBIE

You did?

DESI

It was like kissing a baby. French

kissing a baby.

DEBBIE

Can I ask you something stupid? Do

you know why we're missing money at

the store?

DESI

Are you guys missing money?

DEBBIE

Like twelve thousand dollars.

DESI

Wait. Do you think I took it?

DEBBIE

Well, no. I did, but now I don't.

DESI

It's not me.

DEBBIE

Then, why do you live in such a

nice apartment and have such a

fancy car?

90.

DESI

Yes, you're right. Look. I... am an

escort. I get paid to go out on

dates.

DESI (CONT'D)

But only three to five times a

year. Ten times max. But it's not

technically "prostitution" because

I don't have to sleep with them.

DEBBIE

Well, that's good.

DESI

But I always do. That's why I only

do it four to eight times a year,

fifteen times max.

DEBBIE

Huh.

DESI

One year I did it twenty.

DEBBIE

As long as you think it's safe.

DESI

It's safe. I only do it ten to

thirty times a year.

DEBBIE

So, who do you think is stealing

money?

DESI

It's Jodi.

DEBBIE

No.

DESI

Yeah. She's a pilled-out whore.

DEBBIE

Since you told me, I want to tell

you something.

DESI

You're pregnant.

91.

DEBBIE

How did you know?

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Wow. Maybe you should tell Pete.

DESI

You didn't tell Pete yet? Why not?

DEBBIE

I don't know. I just want him to

want me. I don't want him to want

me because I'm pregnant.

DESI

Go home and suck his dick and tell

him then and he will love it.

DEBBIE

You think?

DESI

He'll be so excited. Or even better

yet, you should tell him while

you're sucking his dick.

(mimes a blow job)

"I'm pregnant."

DEBBIE

What are you doing?

PETE

I'm returning some emails.

DEBBIE

What time do you have to go to

work?

PETE

Like ten minutes ago.

DEBBIE

Want to be late?

92.

PETE

(not looking up)

No, I can't be late. Not today.

DEBBIE

Do you see me? Standing here in

front of you? Half-naked?

PETE

Yeah.

DEBBIE

And does that make you feel

anything?

PETE

Come on. Are you trying to start a

fight?

DEBBIE

No, I'm not trying to start a fight

with you. I'm trying to fuck you!

PETE

Oh god, you know what? Today of all

days you need to give me a break,

all right?

DEBBIE

Whatever.

PETE

I didn't realize it was

intentional! I didn't say anything

because I didn't want you to be

embarrassed. I thought I was being

gallant.

PETE (CONT'D)

All right, fine, I'm an asshole.

DEBBIE

You know what your problem is?

You're never in the moment, you're

never present. You're never in your

body.

93.

PETE

That's not true. I am in the

moment. You know how I know? I want

to get the fuck out of the moment.

I swear, I can't win with you.

DEBBIE

You can't just walk away.

DEBBIE

How's the record company going,

Pete?

PETE

What? Not great. I'm still waiting

for numbers to come in.

DEBBIE

What have you heard?

PETE

A couple numbers have trickled in.

It's lower than we expected.

DEBBIE

Then why are you giving Larry

money?

PETE

What?

DEBBIE

I know everything. I talked to the

accountant.

PETE

All right, you know what? I don't

want to get into some nasty fight.

So can we please talk to each other

like the therapist told us to talk

to each other?

DEBBIE

Fine. It makes me feel sad when you

are dishonest.

PETE

I understand it makes you feel bad

when I am dishonest with you.

(MORE)

94.

PETE (CONT'D)

It hurts my feelings when you treat

me with contempt and corner me and

try and trick me into lying.

DEBBIE

Okay. It makes me sad when it's so

easy to trick you into lying

because you're such a lying

shitbag.

PETE

You can't do that. The therapist

said you're not allowed to judge

me.

DEBBIE

That's not a judgment. That's just

a fact.

PETE

Fair enough. Sometimes I withhold

truth, that is true. But it's only

because I'm scared to death of your

crazy-assed illogical

overreactions.

DEBBIE

Well, it hurts me inside and

triggers me that you're such a

dishonest shit that you're lending

your father money without telling

me, while your record company is

going bankrupt and we're on the

verge of losing our fucking house!

DEBBIE

What else are you lying about?

PETE

I've taken Viagra for two years. I

ate six muffins downstairs a while

ago and my cholesterol level is

305. My heart could explode at any

second. These might be my very last

words.

DEBBIE

Would we even still be together if

I didn't get pregnant fourteen

years ago?

PETE

I'm not going to go down that road.

DEBBIE

Would we?

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Okay.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

You know what? I don't even want to

have a party here. You need to

cancel it.

PETE

No, I'm not. I already paid for the

catering, I put down deposits, and

I`m not going to call everybody

back in two days when change your

mind.

SADIE

Can you please stop licking your

fingers?

SADIE (CONT'D)

Do you know how many germs are on

your hands? And you're putting them

into your mouth. It's gross. Stop.

SADIE (CONT'D)

I'm going to kill you!

97.

PETE

Hey! Sadie, enough! She isn't

hurting anyone. If you want to say

something, keep your mouth shut.

DEBBIE

You have never been nice to her and

now she's getting aggressive with

you. I told you this would happen.

CHARLOTTE

I'm sick of everybody fighting.

DEBBIE

What do you think you're going to

be like when you grow up?

CHARLOTTE

I don't know.

DEBBIE

Do you think you want kids?

98.

CHARLOTTE

Just one.

DEBBIE

Just one? Why?

CHARLOTTE

Because if I have two then the one

will fight with the other one.

DEBBIE

Does it make you sad when you

fight?

CHARLOTTE

I don't want anyone to fight.

DEBBIE

I love you.

CHARLOTTE

Why isn't anybody talking? Why is

it so quiet?

PETE

It's the sounds of silence.

PETE

(singing)

I don't think that I can really

survive... I'm praying for the end

of time, it's all that I can do.

Praying for the end of time, so I

can end my time with you.

99.

SADIE

Stop, Dad.

PETE

It was long ago and it was far

away, it was so much better than it

is today.

CHARLOTTE

How many of those are you going to

eat?

PETE

As many as I want.

CHARLOTTE

I'm going to tell Mom on you.

PETE

Try it. See what you get for

Christmas. Nothing. Snitches wind

up in ditches. Remember that.

CATHERINE

Peter!

PETE

Hey.

CATHERINE

Catherine. I'm Joseph's mother.

PETE

(pleasantly lying)

Oh, right. No, I know. Hi,

Catherine.

CATHERINE

Our kids have gone to school

together for eight years.

PETE

Sorry.

(to Joseph)

Hello, Joseph.

(to Catherine)

(MORE)

100.

PETE (CONT'D)

I hear our kids have been chatting

online.

CATHERINE

Yeah? I heard that your wife has

been screaming at my son and I

don't appreciate it.

PETE

Excuse me?

CATHERINE

She screamed at my son.

(to Joseph)

Right? She threatened you?

(to Pete)

She cursed at him. He's thirteen

years old for god's sake. What the

hell is the matter with her? You

better check her meds and get them

right.

PETE

Okay, why don't you back the fuck

off, because that's my lovely,

sweet wife you're talking about.

CATHERINE

Oh, I need to back off?

PETE

Yeah, you need to back off because

your kid is an animal. Why don't

you put him on a leash?

CATHERINE

(to Joseph)

Turn around!

PETE

If he insults my daughter again,

I'm going to hit him with my car.

Got it? In fact, if you insult my

wife again, you know what I'm going

to do? I'm going to show up at your

house when you're sleeping, and

I'll take your iPad and your iPod

or your iMac and I'll shove them up

your fucking iCunt. I've got

nothing to lose. Your kid is the

problem. My kid is a fucking angel.

I don't have time for this shit.

(MORE)

101.

PETE (CONT'D)

So I'm keeping it together. But if

I wasn't at school right now...

CATHERINE

Don't touch me.

PETE

I didn't touch you.

CATHERINE

You touched my upper breast!

PETE

I didn't. I got right below your

shoulder.

CATHERINE

You got right here.

(to Joseph)

He hit my nipple!

JOSEPH

You what?

PETE

You're insane.

CATHERINE

Why would you do that?

JOSEPH

Did you just touch my mom's nipple?

CATHERINE

He just touched my nipple! Why

would you do that?

PETE

I poked you on the shoulder.

CATHERINE

I have very high nipples.

PETE

I touched your shirt.

CATHERINE

What do you think is under my

shirt? My breasts are under my

shirt.

(to Joseph)

He just touched my breast.

102.

PETE

Your shoulder, your shoulder.

CATHERINE

That's a funny place to put a

shoulder. My boob!

PETE

Hello! There are children around.

CATHERINE

This isn't over. You're going to be

sorry.

(to Joseph)

Let's go!

JODI

Why the fuck would you believe

Desi?

DEBBIE

You just admitted it.

JODI

Did I?

DEBBIE

You stole twelve thousand dollars

from me, Jodi, and I need you to

pay me back.

JODI

Can you at least give me a

referral?

DEBBIE

You babysat my kids while you were

on Oxycontin.

JODI

Oxycotton.

DEBBIE

Oxyconton?

JODI

Oxykitten.

103.

DEBBIE

What's oxykitten?

JODI

Meow.

DEBBIE

Jodi. You put me in danger. Me and

my family.

JODI

It was a cry for help. Help.

(getting weirder)

Help. Why don't you help me? Just

help. Help. Why don't you help me?

DEBBIE

Are you high right now?

JODI

(weirder)

Help me.

JODI (CONT'D)

Is that about me? Is that the cops?

Is this a set-up?

DEBBIE

I need to go.

JODI

Okay, see you later.

(creepily)

Fuck you, Debbie. Fuck. You.

MS. LAVIANI

Joseph was very upset when I spoke

to him about this, so I thought it

was important that we join together

and work this through.

PETE

Absolutely.

104.

CATHERINE

We're going to work through it, but

Debbie told my son that he looked

like Tom Petty, in a negative way--

PETE

Who's Tom Petty?

CATHERINE

You know who Tom Petty is. And she

said that if she had to come back,

that she was going to "F up his

pussy ass." Which is what she said.

DEBBIE

Are you serious? I didn't. I would

never. To a child? Your son has

been defiling my daughter's

Facebook page now for months.

CATHERINE

These people are liars. He said

that my son was an animal and that

if I didn't keep him on a leash

that he would hit him with his car.

MS. LAVIANI

Did you say that?

PETE

That's ridiculous. Who talks like

that?

CATHERINE

You do.

DEBBIE

He didn't say that.

CATHERINE

He said it. To me.

PETE

What I said was that we need to

keep an extra eye on our kids

because with all the technological

advances, they need to learn to use

them responsibly.

CATHERINE

No. He called me an "iCunt."

105.

PETE

MS. LAVIANI

CATHERINE

MS. LAVIANI

CATHERINE

MS. LAVIANI

CATHERINE

DEBBIE

CATHERINE

MS. LAVIANI

CATHERINE

106.

MS. LAVIANI

Okay, Catherine. I think we know

what's happening now.

DEBBIE

Now you know what we're dealing

with.

CHARLOTTE

I'm not going to eat that chicken.

DEBBIE

Why not?

CHARLOTTE

Because I feel like I'm going to be

a vegetarian.

DEBBIE

Can you become a vegetarian

tomorrow?

CHARLOTTE

No.

SADIE

You guys have been reading my

texts?

PETE

No, we haven't.

DEBBIE

Yes, we have. We're supposed to

keep an eye on you.

PETE

How did you find out?

107.

SADIE

PETE

SADIE

DEBBIE

PETE

SADIE

PETE

DEBBIE

SADIE

CHARLOTTE

SADIE

DEBBIE

108.

SADIE

All you do is fight. Or you don't

fight, which is even worse because

it looks like you hate each other

for weeks. You obsess over every

little thing I do, and you don't

trust in me or believe in me. Well,

I'm fucking sick of it! Yeah, I

said "fuck." Fuck fuck fuck. Ground

me forever I don't care. I don't

care about anything.

(crying hard)

I hate everything, everyone's going

crazy, I don't care if I have no

friends.

DEBBIE

Are you still upset about Lost?

SADIE

Of course I'm upset about Lost! You

guys took away my shit before I

could watch the last two episodes!

I don't know what the fuck happens!

DEBBIE

She's becoming just like us.

CHARLOTTE

I hope I never get my period if

this is what happens.

SADIE

Where did you find these?

CHARLOTTE

I stole them.

SADIE

Thank you.

CHARLOTTE

No big deal.

109.

PETE

Our kids are crazy. And it's our

fault.

DEBBIE

Do you think there's anything we

can do to turn it around?

PETE

Sadie's thirteen. She might be a

lost cause.

DEBBIE

Where did she learn that kind of

language? We don't talk like that.

PETE

I have no fucking idea... Do you

think Sadie is this crazy because

of us? Or is it hormones and Lost.

DEBBIE

J.J. Abrams. He's ruining our

daughter. That fucking geek.

PETE

I feel bad for us.

DEBBIE

All of a sudden we're like a magnet

for negativity. Why do people keep

attacking us? What did we do? We're

just doing our best.

PETE

Should we talk about our fight?

DEBBIE

I think we're under enough

pressure. Let's just let it go this

time.

PETE

Yeah.

DEBBIE

We can give each other a break.

110.

PETE

Great. Thank you. And I'm sorry

about my dad. You're right. I'm

sorry that he's just an endless

mooch.

(beat)

The truth is, this isn't about us.

It's about our parents.

DEBBIE

We're not even mad at each other.

We're mad at them.

PETE

Exactly.

DEBBIE

Let's just take away our parents'

power by loving them.

PETE

Can we do that?

DEBBIE

Yes.

PETE

Thank god.

DEBBIE

I kind of feel better already, do

you?

PETE

I do.

DEBBIE

I love you.

PETE

I love you too.

DEBBIE

It's not us, it's them.

PETE

Totally.

111.

PETE

What are you doing? We need to get

ready for the party.

SADIE

(devastated)

I just finished the last episode of

Lost.

PETE

We don't have time for this right

now. We have a lot of people coming

over--

SADIE

(losing it)

They're all dead.

PETE

What?

SADIE

Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

PETE

I don't care about the show right

now-

SADIE

Jin, Sun...

PETE

Okay? I need you to just get in the

shower. Get dressed. Let's just put

it on hold.

SADIE

Walt, Juliet. All those people.

PETE

Don't think about Lost today.

Tomorrow: Lost. All day. I can't

wait to hear about it. Jack? No

way. Really? Right now, shower.

SADIE

I don't make fun of your stupid Mad

Men.

112.

PETE

First of all, I don't get worked up

over Mad Men.

SADIE

That's because Mad Men sucks.

PETE

What Don Draper has gone through

beats whatever Jack is running from

on some island.

SADIE

A bunch of people smoking in an

office, it's stupid.

PETE

You're getting me off topic. Please

get dressed.

DEBBIE

I am so glad you're here. I need a

buffer in case it gets weird.

BARB

Well, I'm ready to buff.

DEBBIE

Here, grab these napkins.

BARRY

So that's the girl who works for

you.

PETE

Yeah, that's her.

BARRY

Seems nice. My wife would never let

me have a hot employee like that.

(MORE)

113.

BARRY (CONT'D)

Everyone that works for us looks

like they've been in some kind of

horrible accident.

BARB

You're comfortable with that around

your husband?

DEBBIE

Pete wouldn't know what to do with

that.

BARRY

You think our wives are looking at

us right now?

PETE

Oh, definitely.

DEBBIE

They look like pedophiles.

DEBBIE (O.C.)

Hey, Pete!

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Jason's here.

JASON

Peter, hi.

PETE

Hey, how's it going?

114.

JASON

Great, you look well. How do you

like what I've been doing to your

girl? How do you like Debbie's

after body?

RONNIE

It's nice.

JASON

Come on, show `em. Look at this.

(points to her ass)

It's beautiful. Look at that after-

ass. Now it starts here, but it

used to start here. And I brought

it up. You're welcome.

RONNIE

Are you a trainer?

JASON

Yes, well, but not just physical.

Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide.

PETE

You guys should talk. I think

you'll get along. Come here, honey,

I have to tell you something.

JASON

Who's that in the pool?

RONNIE

Mine.

DEBBIE

Hello.

OLIVER

Hello, Debbie.

115.

DEBBIE

Remember my husband, Pete?

OLIVER

Oh, yes. I didn't recognize you

with the long hair.

PETE

(people pleasing)

I've been growing it.

OLIVER

Happy birthday.

PETE

Thank you so much.

OLIVER

Very old scotch.

PETE

Oh, wow. You know, I hope it hasn't

expired.

OLIVER

No, scotch doesn't expire. It

improves with age.

PETE

No, I know. Thank you so much.

BARRY

What do you do in Chino, Oliver?

OLIVER

I am a surgeon.

BARB

Wow, what kind?

OLIVER

Mainly of the spine. My specialty

is scoliosis surgery.

116.

BARRY

My mom used to talk to me like I

had scoliosis because I'm a little

hunchy, but that's a different

thing.

OLIVER

Well, you definitely don't look

right.

LARRY

Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're

late. I was in the lab cloning

myself. We're going to have another

seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut

their hair different so we can

finally tell who they are.

LARRY (CONT'D)

You like the new haircut, Travis?

TRIPLET #1

I'm Jack, damn it.

LARRY

Of course you are.

DEBBIE

Larry, this is my father.

LARRY

Really? How are you?

OLIVER

Oliver.

LARRY

Oliver. "Can I have some more?

Please, Oliver, I need a little

morsel." I love that movie. You

must get that all the time.

117.

OLIVER

Not really.

CLAIRE

I'm Claire, Larry's wife. Very good

to see you, but excuse me, I'm

going to go get the kids.

LARRY

We won't see her now for the whole

day. I'd help honey, but I've got

the blood pressure, and I don't

want to.

PETE

Dad, you want a drink?

LARRY

Yeah, a little white wine.

PETE

White wine? Okay, heavy stuff.

LARRY

So, who knew that Debbie had a dad!

Where have you been for fifteen

years? Never seen you at Hanukkah,

Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do

you get out of all that stuff? Do

you have a wife?

OLIVER

My wife is at home.

DEBBIE

Why didn't she come?

OLIVER

Construction. They're sanding our

deck.

LARRY

You let the woman sand the deck?

OLIVER

She supervises it, yes.

DEBBIE

Hey guys.

118.

LARRY

Look how big the kids are. Sadie!

DESI

Hi, Larry.

LARRY

(to Sadie)

Hi, Sadie.

SADIE

Mom. Who is Oliver?

DEBBIE

What do you mean?

CHARLOTTE

Is he your dad?

DEBBIE

He is my biological father.

CHARLOTTE

What does that mean?

DEBBIE

He and my mom had a baby and that

was me.

SADIE

Oh, so you're our grandpa.

OLIVER

Why don't you ask your mother?

DEBBIE

Yes, well, that would make him your

grandpa. Do you want him to be?

CHARLOTTE

Yes. Then we get another grandpa.

Come on!

LARRY

That was deeply uncomfortable.

Thank god the pretty girl was here

to divert our attention.

119.

JASON

Oh, hi. I did not see you there.

RONNIE

I saw you there.

DESI

Did you guys come together? Are you

a couple?

RONNIE / JASON

No, we didn't come together.

Absolutely not.

DESI

Sorry, the mustache is a little--

JASON

That's fair.

DESI

I just assumed.

RONNIE

This is a straight man mustache.

DESI

What is the different between a gay

man's mustache and a straight man's

mustache?

JASON

The smell.

DESI

Excuse me.

120.

LARRY

OLIVER

LARRY

OLIVER

LARRY

121.

LARRY (CONT'D)

You like The Beatles, don't you?

OLIVER

Who doesn't like The Beatles?

LARRY

Nobody.

DESI

So what's your sun sign?

RONNIE

Libra.

JASON

Oh, boy.

DESI

That's not good.

JASON

No, sir.

DESI

Not for me, that's not good.

Sexually we are completely

incompatible.

RONNIE

That's not true.

JASON

That's such a shame. That's as bad

as it gets.

DESI

What's yours?

JASON

I'm a Cancer.

DESI

Really?

JASON

Is that good?

122.

RONNIE

What does it mean?

DESI

That's really strange. Well, Taurus

and Cancers are sort of soul mates

of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly

compatible. I balance what you

lack, and you make up for what I

lack. And a quiet Cancer almost

always has a huge penis.

JASON

(quietly)

You're making me embarrassed.

DEBBIE

I wanted to make a toast. Thank you

guys so much for coming... Pete's

turning forty.

PETE

Weird.

DEBBIE

And we're ready to start this new

phase of our lives with open

hearts. Ready to just choose joy

and forgive everybody, so thank you

all for coming.

LARRY

Wait. Forgive who?

PETE

I think she just meant generally.

You know? Put the past behind us.

DEBBIE

And live without resentments.

LARRY

But specifically who are you

forgiving? I like to know the

details before I toast.

DEBBIE

Well, you and my dad and others.

123.

LARRY

I see. I know you have some issues

with me, but I'm curious, what's he

in for? Before today nobody even

knew he existed.

DEBBIE

My parents divorced when I was

really young and we don't spend

that much time together and I'd

like to work on that. Just like

we'd like to work on how you have

financial issues.

BARRY

(to Larry)

She means all the lending. And the

borrowing...

LARRY

I know what she meant.

JASON

You are a beautiful woman, but you

are not totally maxed out. I would

say honestly, you're a six. Six and

a half. I could make you an eleven.

DESI

Really?

JASON

When I found Deb, she was a seven.

And now she's a twelve.

DESI

I want to be a twelve.

JASON

You can't be lazy.

DESI

I don't want to be lazy.

JASON

Look at me. You cannot be lazy.

DESI

I won't be lazy.

124.

JASON

Do you know how she got her body?

Bodies By Jason.

DESI

Wow.

JASON

Say it.

DESI

Bodies By Jason.

JASON

Say it again.

DESI

Bodies By Jason.

JASON

And now just say Jason.

DESI

Jason.

JASON

Again?

DESI

(whispers)

Jason.

JASON

That sounds right, doesn't it?

DESI

Yeah.

RONNIE

What the fuck is happening right

now?

LARRY

When was the last time you two saw

each other, if you don't mind me

asking?

OLIVER

Actually, we had lunch together

last week.

125.

LARRY

OLIVER

LARRY

DEBBIE

DEBBIE

LARRY

127.

BARRY

That's right. You can't use it up,

it goes forever.

OLIVER

You know what? I have to go.

PETE

Great. What a big surprise. Bye

Oliver. See you later. See you in

another seven years. Make sure to

say goodbye to the grandkids, who

you met today. You know, nothing I

do is right because of you?

Nothing. No matter how hard I try,

I'm just the asshole here, but you

know what I realized? It's you.

You're the asshole.

OLIVER

Good luck working that out. Happy

birthday and go fuck yourself.

LARRY

See you when the Cubs win the

Pennant.

BARB

I'm going to light the candles. Get

it going.

LARRY

Maybe we should try the toast

again.

DEBBIE

Can you be quiet?

(to Pete)

You just threw me under the bus.

PETE

No. We agreed to let go and

forgive, but then you started

ripping into my dad like a crazy

person.

DEBBIE

I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm

just saying to him what you say to

me.

128.

PETE

Don't be such a ball buster.

DEBBIE

I am not a ball buster. You make me

one! I am a fun girl! I am fun-

loving! I am a good time Sally! I

dance hip-hop. I cannot believe

I've wasted my whole life busting

the balls of people who have no

balls. I am the only one here who

has any balls.

SADIE

Mom?

SADIE (CONT'D)

Mom! What are you doing?

DEBBIE

What?

SADIE

You're smoking? In the front yard?

DEBBIE

No, they're Barb's.

129.

SADIE

Mom! Since when have you been a

smoker?

DEBBIE

I'm not a smoker.

SADIE

I thought you said smokers die.

DEBBIE

I wasn't smoking.

SADIE

I saw you.

CHARLOTTE

Mom, you're smoking?

BARB

Deb, you can't smoke, you're

pregnant. You've been doing so

well.

CHARLOTTE

You're pregnant?

SADIE

No f-ing way. I don't want another

sister.

CHARLOTTE

I don't want her as a sister.

BARB

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It just

slipped out.

PETE

(mouth full of cupcake)

Are you really pregnant? Since when

are you pregnant?

DEBBIE

Since when do you care? You don't

want another baby.

130.

PETE

CHARLOTTE

DEBBIE

131.

LARRY

Hey! We just heard. You're having a

baby! See, it can happen to

anybody.

CLAIRE

That is so wonderful. We're so

happy for you.

SADIE

(to Charlotte)

This is too adult for you. Let's go

outside.

DEBBIE

Well, I guess we're stuck together

forever, then, right?

PETE

Weren't we always?

DEBBIE

You don't even want a baby.

PETE

Of course I do. I never said that.

Look, I didn't want one if I could

choose.

DEBBIE

I should put that on a Hallmark

card. That's beautiful.

OLIVER

Good luck with the pregnancy,

Debbie. But please, take care of

yourself. It's a much riskier

pregnancy after forty.

132.

DEBBIE

I'm not forty.

OLIVER

Of course you are. You were born on

December 5th, 1972.

DEBBIE

How do you know?

OLIVER

I was there. I'm the one who took

your mother to the hospital.

DEBBIE

That's not what she said.

OLIVER

Your mom was in labor for only

twenty minutes. It was like you

couldn't wait to meet me, can you

imagine that?

DEBBIE

I don't even know you. You can't

just come into my house and

reminisce.

OLIVER

(walking out)

Look, maybe we were just not meant

to be in each other's lives. I'm

not sure this was such a great

idea.

DEBBIE

Hey, wait a minute. You did leave.

And you didn't come back.

OLIVER

(getting agitated)

My first life was ruined. I did my

best with my second.

DEBBIE

So I ruined your life? I was eight.

133.

OLIVER

People do better when I stay out of

their lives. That's what my son

tells me. You think my life is so

perfect? I've got a thirteen-year-

old who's a pot head, I've got a

wife who's keeping Zoloft alive.

DEBBIE

You never said that before.

OLIVER

You don't think I want to talk to

you about this? To share it with

you? It's just not our way! We

don't talk to each other, we don't

know each other. I thought that's

the way you wanted it. How do I get

out of this? How do I get you all

to just help me down off the cross?

DEBBIE

You sound just like Sadie.

OLIVER

Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter,

your younger?

DEBBIE

The big one.

OLIVER

Your older. I know that! She's a

wonderful girl.

LARRY

Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave.

Would this be a good moment to

sneak out?

SADIE

Where's Dad going?

134.

PETE

Best birthday ever!

TEENAGER

Bike lane, asshole!

PETE

Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass

motherfuckers!

BARB

Your dad's still here.

DEBBIE

I know. It's weird. Where the hell

is Pete?

SADIE

Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out

here for a while?

DEBBIE

Sure. Hi, Joseph.

JOSEPH

Hi.

DEBBIE

Do you want a piece of cake?

JOSEPH

Oh, yeah sure. Thank you.

135.

JOSEPH (CONT'D)

All right, then.

BARB

They are so cute.

DEBBIE

So cute.

BARB

He looks exactly like Tom Petty.

PETE

Go around!

PETE (CONT'D)

Watch it!

DESI

Hey, Pete. Great party!

PETE

Yeah. The best!

SADIE

Then you shake it. And then a

restaurant comes up.

136.

DEBBIE

Dad? Excuse me. I'm going to go

look for Pete. Would you mind

staying with the girls for just a

little bit?

OLIVER

(shocked)

Well, if you want me to.

DEBBIE

If you don't mind. You don't have

to.

OLIVER

Sure.

(beat)

Can I let Sadie show me the last

episode of Lost? She asked me if

I'd seen it, I haven't.

DEBBIE

That would be nice. Thank you.

OLIVER

Thank you.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

(to Sadie)

She said we could watch it.

SADIE

I'm going to let you watch Lost.

Come on.

CHARLOTTE

Is it scary?

SADIE

I'll cover your eyes if it gets too

scary.

137.

LARRY

Are you mad at me? Did I say

something?

DEBBIE

Shh. Larry, please.

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

Are you fucking kidding me?

PETE

You opened your door on me.

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

I didn't open my fucking door on

you. I opened my door!

PETE

I was right there! You are supposed

to look before you open your door.

I was in the fucking bike path.

138.

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

That's a blind spot. There's no

fucking bike path. This is a

residential section. Get your head

out of your ass.

PETE

Pay attention!

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

Open your god damn eyes. What are

you doing, sleepwalking?

PETE

You're supposed to look to see if a

biker is coming through. You're

supposed to look!

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

It's not my job to look out for

you. You look out for yourself. I

don't look out for you. I don't see

you. I don't now where the fuck you

are and what you're doing.

PETE

No one is ever looking out for me!

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

I need your name and number.

PETE

Why?

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

Because you're going to pay for my

door.

PETE (O.S.)

Fuck you!

PETE

Why don't you pay for my bike --

and my face, you fucking prick!

139.

MAN IN RANGE ROVER

Don't disrespect me.

LARRY

Are you sure that's him? I don't

think that's him.

PETE

(in pain)

I'm going to write down your

license plate number.

PETE (CONT'D)

"Range Rover of Sunland."

DEBBIE

What are you doing?

PETE

Ow.

140.

LARRY

I guess the party didn't turn out

like you planned.

DEBBIE

It wasn't a good party.

NURSE

Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as

his x-rays are finished.

DEBBIE

Is he okay?

NURSE

Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's

been crying a little bit, but he'll

be fine.

LARRY

You know Pete was never a real

fighter. But that's why he married

you. That's why he loves you.

Because you're the fighter, and you

need that. One person in a

relationship has got to punch.

DEBBIE

Do you mean that in a good way?

LARRY

Oh, it's a high compliment.

DEBBIE

Thanks.

LARRY

Listen, I know what you're worried

about. You think he's going to turn

into me, but I don't think it's

going to happen. He's smarter and

probably a little cuter. A little

less Jewy. Although, after fifty,

that's all going to change. Be

prepared to wake up one day with a

a rabbi. But the good news is,

he'll love you forever. That's in

our DNA. We stick around.

141.

DEBBIE

He worries about you. It puts a lot

of pressure on him.

LARRY

I know. I just don't have anyone

else to talk to about it.

DEBBIE

You can talk to Claire.

LARRY

No. If I open up to her she'll

leave me.

DEBBIE

No, she won't, Larry, she loves

you.

LARRY

I know, but there's a certain point

at which you just can't stay.

(beat)

I guess it's hard to forgive

somebody if they don't formally

apologize to you.

DEBBIE

Are you apologizing?

LARRY

I'm very close.

(beat)

Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad

everybody's okay.

DEBBIE

Thanks.

LARRY

I'm off.

DEBBIE

Okay.

LARRY

This is awkward.

DEBBIE

What?

142.

LARRY

I need forty dollars for a cab.

DEBBIE

(laughing)

That's funny.

LARRY

No, I'm not kidding. You drove me.

I wasn't prepared.

DEBBIE

I only have a hundred.

LARRY

That's okay. I'll bring you the

change.

LARRY (CONT'D)

All right, give him a kiss for me.

OLIVER

I don't get it.

SADIE

See, it's not sad, it's happy

because they helped each other

achieve their destiny.

OLIVER

Oh.

CHARLOTTE

Great. I'm going to have some

freaky ass nightmares.

DEBBIE

I really liked our lives so much

better before we tried to change

everything. I'm sorry.

143.

PETE

Really? I don't believe you, but

you're sweet for saying that.

DEBBIE

How do we break you out of here?

PETE

I can just leave on my own

volition. It's not a mental

institution.

DEBBIE

Can you?

PETE

It's not like One Flew Over the

Cuckoo's Nest. Please don't put a

pillow over my face.

DEBBIE

Let's get out of here, McMurphy.

PETE

You got it, Chief. Will you carry

me?

DEBBIE

I like this song.

PETE

Really?

DEBBIE

Yeah. Why?

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Why don't you sign him?

146.

PETE

Ryan Adams? No, he wouldn't sign

with me.

DEBBIE

Why not? You're the best.

PETE

Well, he is in between labels.

Let's go try and talk to him after

the show.
