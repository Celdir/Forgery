ROGER LEMKE (V.O.)

The Brown River Valley: It's where

we work. It's where we play. It's

where we live. But even here in

paradise, accidents can happen.

ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)

At Northlands Insurance, our goal is

to provide high quality insurance

services and related products to

businesses and individuals in

Wisconsin's Northlands. I'm Roger

Lemke. Not only do I care about you,

we also endeavor to give you the

coverage you need at the best prices

around. It's that reason Northlands

has been awarded the prestigious Two

Diamond Award from the American

Society of Mutual Insurers three

years running. Because at Northlands

Insurance, we insure your dreams.

MATCH CUT TO:

BILL KROGSTAD

Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta

the park, Roger! Out of the G-D

park, you sonofagun!

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ROGER LEMKE

Hell, I'm just a pretty face, Bill.

That copy was all you. Do got one

little gripe though, boss-- if

you'd waited until after Cedar

Rapids we could've said winner of

the Two Diamonds four years

running!

BILL KROGSTAD ROGER LEMKE

GWEN LEMKE

So proud of you, Roggie. God, you

rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?!

ROGER LEMKE

(an Elvis impersonation)

Thank you. Thank you very much!

ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)

Tim! Timmy Lippe! Didn't even know

you were here. You see it, bud?

TIM

(earnest, deeply admiring)

Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome.

TIM (CONT'D)

Just super... super awesome. Man.

ROGER LEMKE

Y'know what Tim, I want people to

see the insurance game for what it

really is-- it's a noble field. I

believe that. Like I say, we're not

just insuring vehicles and homes

and that. Hell no. We're insuring

people's dreams.

TIM

Oh. Yeah. I say that, too...

sometimes.

3.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ROGER LEMKE

Well shit, you do, don't you? By

god, I stole your line! Knew I'd

heard that somewhere!

TIM

Oh, no biggie...

ROGER LEMKE

Bummer they cut your little deal

outta the ad, though.

TIM

Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'...

FEMALE CO-WORKER

Roger! Look out Brad Pitt!

TIM

The ol' cutting room floor, right?

(upon being ignored)

Brad Pitt. Ha. That's...

(then, with forced nonchalance)

Whoa. Cake. Cool.

TIM (CONT'D)

So awesome.

4.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

There she is! How you feeling?

MILLIE

Oh, it's no big whoop.

TIM

Ta-da.

(re. the stuffed duck)

Quack, quack. D'you already have

this guy? Wasn't sure.

5.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE

Gayle Syrstad gave me a Quackers

for Secret Santa last year. I can

probably trade with Nan, though.

MILLIE (CONT'D)

(chuckles at the card)

Cute. Brandy would never sit still

long enough for me to dress her up

like that. Tell you that right now.

(THEN)

You didn't have to do this whole

rigmarole, Tim. I told you it's

just a little diarrhea.

TIM

I know. But for you to miss a day

of school, Millie... I can't

remember you ever calling in sick

when I had you.

MILLIE

Well I wasn't going through

menopause when you were in middle

school now was I?

TIM

Negative. Not to my knowledge. Not

to my knowledge.

TIM (CONT'D)

So. Does your tummy feel good

enough to...?

CUT TO:

6.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

I can try and... hold it, Mil. Can

you...?

MILLIE

Bring it home. Bring it home.

TIM

I'm bringing it. Bringing it!

Bringing it! D'aaaarrgho'awesome...

TIM

Ooh, you make me live! You're my

best friend!

MILLIE

C'mon Tim, I can't hear.

TIM

Sorry. But you are, babygirl.

(SINGS)

You're my best friend.

MILLIE

Tss. Goofball.

MILLIE (CONT'D)

Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just

did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty

reasonable they said, price-wise.

TIM

(mediocre Jamaican accent)

Ya mon, Bahama-mama.

MILLIE

It's a little different I suppose--

a cruise. But...

7.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE (CONT'D)

Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally

around here, Tim. I found a river

cruise through Germany-- Viking

Line, real grade-A. It's what I

want. For the honeymoon.

TIM

(SUDDENLY RATTLED)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait...

Where's this coming from? We agreed

on Wisconsin Dells for the

honeymoon. It's what we agreed on.

MILLIE

You've been to the Dells two dozen

times...

TIM

So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the

Dells every year...

MILLIE

Because they have children. Water

parks are for children...

TIM

Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky

and Stage Show? It's not just a

water park...

MILLIE

Timothy, settle. You've never even

left the state of Wisconsin. Barely

left Brown Valley...

TIM

What's so great about...? You're

not... You're missing the... We

agreed on the Dells.

MILLIE

God rest her. Your mom was my best

friend. But it's going on 20 years

now. You gotta grow up. You gotta

let go. You gotta live a life here.

See?

TIM

I'm living a perfectly fine life. I

don't know why you'd want to...

(MORE)

8.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

rock the waters or whatever.

Ridiculous.

TIM (CONT'D)

We agreed on the Dells.

FADE OUT:

TIM

Hello... Oh, hey Bill...

TIM (CONT'D)

Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No...

WADE

Guy had it all. Everything you'd

ever want. Y'know he flew a Cessna?

In his spare time?

MILLIE

I always say people like that-- who

live fast? They die hard. Look at

River Phoenix.

WADE

Everything you'd ever want.

MILLIE

I just don't know. To do those

things to yourself. Just perverted.

(SIGH)

Who ever heard of such a thing?

9.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is--

was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He

just... he had it all. If there's...

TIM (CONT'D)

I'm...

FADE OUT:

PAM

You just don't get it, Kurt...

KURT

Aw Christ, Pammy...

TIM

Hang on guys, how's this sound--

you can both be right.

(pause for effect)

I know you're probably thinking,

"Oh, an umbrella policy's only for

rich people." You know what I say

to that? Bull roar.

10.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys

since you were little kids. So

let's don't think of me as an

"insurance salesman." Think of me

as your friend who just wants to

help you protect your dreams...

TIM (CONT'D)

I'm... Excuse me a sec...

TIM (CONT'D)

D'you-- can I get you a napkin or

something, Bill? For that?

BILL KROGSTAD

Know how Roger used to get down

there to Cedar Rapids? To the ASMI

Convention? Any idea?

TIM

Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky...

BILL KROGSTAD

Flew himself. In a Cessna. Pilot.

(a mournful beat)

It was all worked out. I was going

to ease into retirement in July

while Roger transitioned into his

ownership role.

TIM

Wait, Roger was going to buy

Northlands?

BILL KROGSTAD

All worked out. Shit, Dione already

put the down payment on a time

share. Branson, Black Hills.

Florida. Units all over the place.

TIM

Holy cow.

11.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD

Yeah, whole deal. Now? Now I got my

back up against Christ-knows-what.

No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's

spending like we won the goddamn

Powerball. And what's worse,

because of the way, y'know, the way

Roger passed...

TIM

The... belt and the lederhosen...?

BILL KROGSTAD

(a nod, a sigh)

Quote-unquote perverted, they're

saying. Like Northlands has some

kind of stain. Oh, I'm so goddamned

tired...

TIM

Is there...? Can I do anything to

help, or...?

TIM (CONT'D)

"Innovations in Hog Farm Risk

Mitigation." Roger's Two Diamond

presentation for the ASMI

Convention. I helped prepare it.

BILL KROGSTAD

We need those Two Diamonds more

than ever, Tim. If I'm going to

sell this company, we need people

to feel OK about the Northlands

brand.

TIM

(not getting it)

Mm.

BILL KROGSTAD

I'd go myself but my daughter

Kayla, the heavy one? She unearthed

some Polack to marry her. I'm

locked into that wedding over in

Gladstone. No flex. Locked in.

12.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying?

BILL KROGSTAD

I'm not asking you to fill Roger

Lemke's shoes. Not gonna happen.

I'm asking you to deliver his

presentation-- to bring me home

those Two Diamonds.

TIM

I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To

Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't

Lila do it?

BILL KROGSTAD

C'mon Tim. Lila's about as

charismatic as a bag of hair.

TIM

Bill, I've never... I mean, I've

dabbled in hog farm risk

mitigation, but I'm no pro...

BILL KROGSTAD

You were what, 16, when I gave you

that filing job? Right after your

mom passed? Raising yourself pretty

much, living all alone. And I'm

thinking, now here's a kid. Here's

a kid who's gonna go places.

(a hand on Tim's shoulder)

And then, somehow, you kind of just

didn't. Now, I guess it makes some

sense-- a child loses both parents

at an early age, becomes what you

might call stunted. But cripes

almighty, do you want to just sit

there in your folks old house, just

rot away in Brown Valley dating

that...

(SUBTLY DISPARAGING)

... woman the rest of your life?

TIM

Millie and I are getting married.

BILL KROGSTAD

Tss, maybe three'll be a charm.

(then, emotional)

(MORE)

13.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

Point is, I'm not exactly dancing

in the streets here Tim, but it's a

perception thing. You go down there

to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie-

eyed and all that. You show them

that Northlands is a good outfit--

an upstanding Christian outfit...

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

Aw cripes, say you'll do it.

MONTAGE --

14.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

WADE

Oh, hiya Tim.

TIM

Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...?

MILLIE

Hi Tim.

(re. Wade's presence)

Wade's cable's down.

TIM

It's six AM...?

WADE

Mike & Mike in the Morning. ESPN 2.

TIM

Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha.

WADE

Mm.

TIM

(finally, to Millie)

Well I just wanted to...

TIM (CONT'D)

Oh shoot. You already have a Strut

the Rooster...

MILLIE

So this is it then?

(TO WADE)

Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids

this morning, Wade. Big deal

insurance convention. Iowa.

WADE

That right?

TIM

It's only four days.

15.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE

Won't go to Germany for our

honeymoon, but for work you can

just gallivant around like Tom

Petty or one of them?

TIM

(TO WADE)

We agreed on the Dells...

(then, to Millie)

Should we maybe talk in the...?

WADE

Oh it don't bother me.

TIM

If I don't try to do this, it's not

just my job, Mil. There are four

other employees whose lives are on

the line. Plus Carol, who does part

time seasonal work. So.

MILLIE

It's not for certain a new owner

would even keep you guys on.

TIM

No, Bill said he'd make that part

of any deal...

MILLIE

Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is

looking out for one guy. And that's

Bill Krogstad.

WADE

(OVERTLY DISPARAGING)

Krogstad.

TIM

It's... Oh, who am I kidding, I'm a

little scared here. A lot scared.

But not about us. What we've got--

we're like lightning in a bottle,

babygirl. I love you so much, Mil.

MILLIE

I want you to be very careful.

16.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

I know. I will. I mean, Cedar

Rapids-- there were only four

homicides last year. For a city of

122-thousand that's pretty darn

good. The forcible rape numbers are

admittedly a bit higher, but...

MILLIE

I want you to check in with me.

TIM

I will every day. Twice a day.

MILLIE

Make it three times.

TIM

(LAUGHS)

OK, three times! Sheesh. And I'll

send a stinkin' telegram, too.

RETARDED MAN

Airport don't open for two hours.

TIM

Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make

my flight. Going down to Cedar

Rapids. The big ASMI Convention?

DISSOLVE TO:

17.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Cold enough for you? I'm heading to

Cedar Rapids. Supposed to be up in

the mid-30s down there. S-weet!

TSA AGENT

Any liquids, gels or aerosols must

be placed in a quart-size Zip-Lock.

Laptop computers must be taken out

of the case and placed in...

TIM

Whoa... what's all this now?

TSA AGENT

Any liquids, gels or aerosols...

BILL KROGSTAD (O.S.)

Tim! Praise Christ you haven't left

yet.

TIM

Hey Bill, what's going on?

BILL KROGSTAD

Can't believe I forgot to get this

to you. Hang on, lemme...

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

It's basically an ASMI Convention

Bible. It's going to tell you who

to talk to, who to avoid, how best

to fellowship and network...

TIM

Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point.

BILL KROGSTAD

Ziegler is a cancer. Sonofabitch

called one of Lemke's biggest

clients-- Joyce Armbruster? Smeared

Roger's name and the Northlands'

name. Frickin' poacher. Avoid

Ziegler like the plague. The fella

I got you rooming with, Ronald

Wilkes-- that's who you stick by.

18.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

You got the presentation, right?

TIM

Affirmative.

TIM (CONT'D)

On me at all times. Plus three back-

up discs.

BILL KROGSTAD

Hey-hey! That kind of prep is pure

Lemke! Didn't know any better, I'd

say Roger's spirit had kind of

climbed into you, just planted its

seed inside you there. Atta boy!

TIM

Bill... I have to ask. Let's say

one of these big dogs-- your

Allstates, your Prudentials-- does

decide to go and buy Northlands...?

BILL KROGSTAD

Said it before, I'll say it again:

Your job, the office in Brown

Valley-- all safe. What you need to

worry about is getting down there

and representing us the best you

can. That's all you need to worry

about.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

You lucky ducks are obviously

seated in an exit row. Score!

(MORE)

19.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

Just gotta make sure you're willing

and able to assist crew members in

the event of an emergency

evacuation...

TIM

You're talking what, water landing?

(looks around, whispers)

Terror type deal? Terrorists...?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

It's really just a formality.

TIM

Believe it or not, I have actually

never been on an airplane before.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Oh, well you'll do awesome.

TIM

(takes a moment)

OK. If you need any help, I'm in.

TIM

Tim Lippe.

MAN

Ah. David Marinakis.

TIM

Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering,

what kind of name is Marinakis?

DAVID MARINAKIS

Greek. It's Greek.

TIM

Marinakis. OK. Mine's German.

Lippe.

(MORE)

20.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

As in, "Don't you get lippy with

me, mister." My grandma used to say

that. Before she passed. Lot of

people pronounce it lip. Course the

high German's probably more like

lipp-uh.

TIM

Like I say, Dave, it's not life

insurance so much as it is dream

insurance.

DAVID MARINAKIS

It's a good way of looking at it.

TIM

I think so.

TIM (CONT'D)

Let me know how things go with your

Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me.

DAVID MARINAKIS

Will do, Tim. Thanks.

TIM

Hello. Score!

21.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

Holy crap. Awesome.

BREE

Hey man, can I bum a heater?

TIM

What's that now?

BREE

A cigarette?

TIM

Oh, I'm like, "this gal wants to

borrow my heater?" Tss. But no,

sorry, can't help you there.

BREE

You here for the convention?

TIM

You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands

Insurance. How `bout yourself?

BREE

Ah, Bree. I'm Bree.

TIM

Well Bree, it's nice to meet you.

But let me give you a trade secret.

(STAGE WHISPER)

Keep smoking and your premiums will

go through the roof.

BREE

Thanks Mr. Surgeon General.

(they laugh, then)

(MORE)

22.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BREE (CONT'D)

If you want to party, Tim, let me

know. I'll be around.

TIM

You bet. Party hearty. Nice

chatting with you, Bree.

TRENT

Checking in with us, sir?

TIM

You tell me. Never done the hotel

deal before.

TRENT

Well, welcome. I'll just need to see

a credit card for the incidentals...

TIM

(reads the name tag)

Trent, I was given the impression

that you honored traveler's checks.

TRENT

Yes, we just need an imprint of

your card. For the incidentals.

TIM

Traveler's check is a fully insured

method of, y'know. 100 percent.

TRENT

I'm aware of that, sir. We won't

charge the card unless you rent a

movie or take something from the

mini-bar...

TIM

I'm a non-drinker.

TRENT

It's standard, sir.

23.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Have you seen the pool yet?

TIM

Not yet, but I can smell it. The

chlorine. It's a super top-notch

place, Mil. You'd be blown away.

Oop, 321. I'm at mi casa. Just a...

lemme see how this deal works.

TIM (CONT'D)

Key's like a stinkin' credit card.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

What? What happened?

TIM

(to the man)

Oh jeez. I'm sorry. I'm... Please.

(turns, whispers into phone)

There's an Afro-American gentleman

in this room.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Well get the heck outta there!

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

Tim! Run like hell, Tim!

BLACK MAN

Are you Tim? Tim Lippe?

BLACK MAN (CONT'D)

I'm Ronald Wilkes. Bill Krogstad

said we were gonna be roommates?

24.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Tim! Tim! Tiiim!

TIM

(INTO PHONE)

Let me call you back, Mil.

RONALD

You are Tim...?

TIM

Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a

minute there I was like, whoa, I'm

gonna be robbed here, or...

TIM (CONT'D)

It's super... just super great to

meet you, Ronald.

RONALD

OK. You want to check out the room

then?

TIM

Check out these digs. Huzzah!

RONALD

Yeah, you could do a lot worse.

(a serious beat)

Look Tim, I gotta put the cards on

the table here. The reason we got

the junior suite upgrade is because

the hotel overbooked-- wedding or

some such. Point being, they were

asking folks to take on a third

roommate to consolidate space. Now

to me, being an independent owner,

the savings of adding a third guy

sounded like a real positive.

(MORE)

25.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD (CONT'D)

But if you've got any qualms, I

hear you L & C, that's Loud &

Clear.

TIM

No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck

yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be

chilling with, roommate-wise?

RONALD

No. Just hope he doesn't snore.

TIM

(LAUGHS BOISTEROUSLY)

Can you imagine? Or someone who has

terrible gas?! Like, pull my

finger. Brrump! Hello, no thanks!

RONALD

This isn't Woodstock, Tim. It's a

regional insurance convention.

Whoever it is, I'm sure he'll be a

straight shooter.

CUT TO:

MAN (O.S.)

Hey Taco Bill, am I gonna see you

at Horizons tonight? I hear they

got their all-you-care-to-eat pussy

buffet going!

26.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

So far it's just the one billboard

north of St. Cloud. Course the

traffic load would get me more

eyeballs in the Twin Cities corridor,

but at the end of the day, it's N-T-

S. Not Too Shabby.

TIM

Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd

love to own my own agency...

DEAN

Baroo-baroo, let's get this party

started you mother-rubbers!

DEAN (CONT'D)

Ronald Wilkes! No fucking way! The

Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my

soul broth-uh!

RONALD

Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You

just got here, for Pete's sake.

DEAN

What's the matter, friend, never

seen a chocolate-vanilla love

sandwich?! Wait until later when we

get to the buttfucking! Nah, I'm

having fun. Dean Ziegler. Stevens

Point, Wisconsin.

DEAN (CONT'D)

Don't worry, I won't bite. I'm

medicated. Not really. But I should

be. Right Ronimal? So what's your

handle pal?

27.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

We drew the short straw with this

pitiful reprobate, Tim. Dean, this

is Tim Lippe.

DEAN

Call me Deanzie. Where you hail

from, Tim Lippe? Quiet-land?

TIM

No. I do not. I'm down from Brown

Valley, Wisconsin.

(POINTED)

Northlands Insurance.

DEAN

Bill Krogstad's outfit. The Krogger!

(beat, dials it way down)

Aw shit. I was sorry as hell to

hear about Lemke's passing up

there. That guy was tits as a rep.

Course he thought I was a big, loud

asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far

off there. No boy, a real tragedy.

TIM

(SUSPICIOUS)

Uh, thanks. Thank you. It's...

Roger was just a super great man.

DEAN

Amen. He'll be in my prayers. His

family, too. Tragedy.

DEAN (CONT'D)

Well. I don't know about you

wingnuts, but the Deanzie could use

a drinkzie. What say we blow off

the welcome hoo-ha and hit Horizons

for happy hour. Two-for-one

cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an

all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet!

RONALD

That line was unappealing last

year, Dean. It remains so now.

TIM

I'm planning to watch President

Helgesson's opening remarks.

28.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

Oh, don't get me started on that

smug fuck. Orin Helgesson is a--

pardon my French-- a cunt. Just a

steaming wet dog cunt.

RONALD

No one's buying the potty-mouth

nonsense you're selling, Dean. Tim,

you'll learn to ignore this

degenerate before too long. Let's

go hear what Orin has to say.

DEAN

Fine. Have fun ladies... Not.

DEAN (CONT'D)

Party time. Excellent.

ORIN

I'm Orin Helgesson, your ASMI

Midwest Region Chapter President.

But I'm not going to make you play

Hail to the Chief. Not yet anyhow.

ORIN (CONT'D)

Seriously, we've got a great line-

up for ASMI `09, with our forward-

looking theme, Let's Build a Bridge

to the 22nd Century! Just so many

innovations-- our newsletter, The

ASMI-teer is now fully digital. So

a lot of our breakout sessions will

be dealing with this kind of "E-

Commerce" sort of thing.

(pause for polite applause)

(MORE)

29.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN (CONT'D)

If you didn't pick up your Welcome

Kits, be sure and see Mike Pyle,

the gentleman in the-- what color's

that sweater vest Mike?

MIKE PYLE

Beige.

ORIN

In the beige sweater vest. Great.

TIM

(WHISPERING)

I'm worried about this Deanzie guy.

Bill Krogstad told me specifically

to stay the heck away from him.

RONALD

Oh, Dean ran for President against

Orin last year-- only got four

votes. He's running again this

year. He's just full of bluster.

ORIN

... The Two Diamonds are given

every year to the agency that best

exemplifies the ASMI decree: "To

provide high quality insurance

services and related products while

maintaining Commitment to

Community, Country and God." We

have a record number of entries

this year-- over 15 agencies

competing. Good luck to you all.

TIM

Did he say over 15 agencies?

RONALD

Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this

year. I brought my A-game though.

TIM

You're competing?

30.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

Heck yeah. It's the first year I've

ever had a real shot. But the guy

you really have to worry about is

Mike Pyle. He owns the sixth

largest Allstate agency in the

Upper Midwest. The guy's a shark.

ORIN

... moment of silence for the man

many considered to be the Michael

Jordan of Mutual Insurance Agents.

Roger Lemke.

ORIN (CONT'D)

Were you there when they crucified

my Lord? Were you there when they

crucified my Lord?

CUT TO:

TIM

I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in

over my head here. I feel like I

can't even swim. It was fun at

first, but now it's like, I dunno.

I need you so bad, babygirl...

WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Millie's in the john.

TIM

Who's...? Wade?

WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)

You bet.

31.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Are...? You're at Millie's still?

WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Badger hockey's on. My cable's out.

(SILENCE)

You want her to give you a ring

when she's off the john?

TIM

Um. Yes, please. And just, would

you tell her I love her very much.

WADE (O.S.)

You got it, bud.

WOMAN

You were checking me out.

WOMAN (CONT'D)

I'm gonna have to tell the hotel

there's a pervo in the fitness

center hitting on innocent women.

TIM

I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you...

I wouldn't... I have a fiance!

WOMAN

Unbelievable. That poor woman

should know what you're up to.

TIM

No, no, no, please. I didn't...

32.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

WOMAN

I am so sorry. I'm totally messing

with you. God, I'm a jerk.

TIM

Ha. OK. That was different. Ha.

Yes. Yes you are. A real...

jerkhead.

WOMAN

I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox.

TIM

Tim Lippe.

JOAN

Don't get lippy with me, mister.

JOAN (CONT'D)

So do you play professional

basketball, Tim? Because that's a

pretty updated uniform there.

TIM

No I don't. I'm actually in town

for the ASMI convention.

JOAN

Oh, is that where a bunch of guys

sit around a table looking up the

word "gullible" in a dictionary?

TIM

No, it's an association of insur...

Oh. You're screwing with me again.

JOAN

Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI,

too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska.

Just kidding-- Omaha.

(wipes off some sweat)

Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to

bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See

you at Horizons tonight?

TIM

Um.

33.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

Unless you were planning on spying

on me in the shower.

JOAN (CONT'D)

God, I am evil. I need help.

ORIN

How ya doin'?

TIM

Oh. I... OK.

(THEN)

I... I really enjoyed your speech,

President Helgesson.

ORIN

You were in there? Marvelous. Did

you like the part about E-Commerce?

TIM

You bet. Very much, sir.

ORIN

Terrific. It's the future y'know.

Anyhow, I don't think we've...

TIM

Tim Lippe. Down from Brown Valley,

Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance?

ORIN

Whew boy. Tim, what can I say? I

just-- we're all feeling it. I'm so

sorry for the loss...

34.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Um, well, it's rough. Real rough.

Like you said in your remarks,

Roger wasn't just a great rep, he

was a good father and...

ORIN

And a pilot. Flew a Cessna.

TIM

Yeah. It's just rough.

ORIN

Come here, son.

TIM

Thank you.

ORIN

Tim, I know Bill's looking to

retire and from the sound of it

he's on the hook for a pretty sweet

time share.

TIM

Yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch.

ORIN

I want to help him find a buyer,

and God knows I'll try my

darnedest. But-- and it pains me to

say this-- there's a petition going

around trying to rescind all of

Northlands' Two Diamond Awards.

TIM

What?!

ORIN

I know. But let's be honest, one of

the core tenets of the Two Diamonds

is Commitment to God. And the way

Roger passed on... well, some folks

are saying that type of activity

isn't entirely "godly."

35.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN (CONT'D)

You have to understand, this isn't

some namby-pamby local event. This

is a regional convention, Tim. Now,

I want to help you, but you're

going to have to help yourself too.

ORIN (CONT'D)

Let me give you a few extra drink

coupons for Horizons. Get down

there-- fellowship and network. Buy

a few drinks. Let `em see the good

side of Northlands Insurance-- the

wholesome side, OK?

TIM

Thank you President Helgesson.

ORIN

Please. Orin. And if you need

anything, Tim-- I mean anything--

I'm up in the Tiffany Suite. Room

411. Balcony overlooks the pool.

DEAN (O.S.)

Timbo! Over here roomie!

DEAN (CONT'D)

How's she hanging Big Tim? Big time

Big Tim...

TIM

Hello Dean.

DEAN

It's Deanzie, c'mon.

(shouts at bartender)

Ahoy Cap'n, we got a thirsty sailor

over here!

(MORE)

36.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN (CONT'D)

(re. the bartender)

Kid was in the navy. Seaman.

BARTENDER

What can I getcha?

TIM

Ah. Do you guys have root beer?

DEAN

You want a nipple with that?

TIM

Ah, why would I need a nipple...?

DEAN

Ach, I'm busting your balls. You

don't get out much, do you buddy?

(spots Tim's drink coupons)

Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get

all those?

TIM

I didn't... Nobody. President

Helgesson gave them to me.

DEAN

Smug fuck. Trying to poison my

roommate with his B-S propaganda.

TIM

I really don't... Orin, President

Helgesson, he wanted to help me

meet people. Just being friendly.

DEAN

(softens, fatherly)

Wow-wow-wow, you are naive. A rail

cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times

that by 10 drink coupons. We're

talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound

so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds

more like one of these I-scratch-

your-back-you-scratch-mine deals.

(off Tim's confused look)

I bet ol' Orin invited you up to

the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth

floor? View of the pool? Yup.

(leans in, conspiratorial)

Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal.

37.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN (CONT'D)

Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here!

(TO TIM)

Bill Hernandez. I call him Taco

Bill. Mexican.

LATER --

DEAN

So Big Time Tim, what're you looking

for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids?

TIM

Ah, that would be nothing...

DEAN

That your mom?

TIM

No. No it is not. Millie and I are

engaged. To be married.

RONALD

You're married yourself, Ziegler.

The heck's your moral compass?

DEAN

My moral compass is pointing true

north, if you read me. Right Taco

Bill?

DEAN (CONT'D)

And by the way, Ronimal-- I was

married. Was.

RONALD

Oh jeez. You and Patti split? Sorry

to hear that.

DEAN

(barely covering the pain)

Ah, she's a fucking asshole.

(MORE)

38.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN (CONT'D)

Together 17 years. Lucky if one of

`em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE.

DEAN (CONT'D)

What I was talking about anyway,

Ronimal, is that from what I can

deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has

led a-- shall I say-- sheltered

existence. And I think we oughta

help him, y'know, aroo-aroo!

RONALD

ASMI isn't a vacation for everybody,

Dean. End of the day, Tim's here to

work and to win. For his agency.

TIM

Exactly. And P-S, I would never,

ever have "relations" or whatever

with another woman.

JOAN (O.S.)

Hubba-hubba, check out these studs.

RONALD

Joan Ostrowski-Fox.

DEAN

The O-Fox!

JOAN

Here she is, Miss America.

RONALD

You fly in from Omaha, Joan?

JOAN

Yup. And boy are my arms tired.

39.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN (CONT'D)

No, not really. I drove. Deanzie,

let me say...

(does Billy Crystal character)

... you look maah-velous!

DEAN

(does a bad Austin Powers)

Oh yeah baby. Shag-a-licious!

DEAN (CONT'D)

Tim, this is the Queen Bee of ASMI,

Joan Ostrowski-Fox. The O-Fox.

TIM

Hey. Ha. From the fitness center.

JOAN

Hey! It's Tim "don't get lippy with

me" Lippe.

RONALD

You guys met?

JOAN

Oh yeah, and I was very naughty in

there. I'm sorry about that, Tim.

DEAN

No she's not.

JOAN

No I'm not.

(THEN)

Shots! What'll it be, gentlemen?

DEAN

Oh yeah, Jaeger time!

RONALD

Oh what the heck. Drambuie.

JOAN

Lippe?

TIM

Oh, I don't, ah...

40.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

Ah... Grenadine? Please.

SLAM CUT TO:

JOAN

Careful you don't get too loaded,

Lippe, or I might have to take

advantage of you.

TIM

It's been a super long day. I, ah,

better... Good night...

DEAN

(sings Hall & Oates)

Whoa-o here she comes-- she's a man

eater!

TIM

Hello Bree.

BREE

(VAGUELY SEXY)

Hey. Hey.

MILLIE

Marlene's brother's back in the

hospital, so bridge got canceled.

So we just watched hockey.

TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)

We?

41.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE

Me and Wade.

TIM

Wade.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

He says hey.

TIM

Oh. Tell him hey.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Tim says hey...

MILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

I picked up that diet wet food for

Brandy today.

TIM

I have to do some work before bed,

so...

MILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE)

(TERSE)

Well I should let you go.

TIM

No, it's-- I love you so bad,

babygirl. It's so hard here. I just

miss you.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

I miss you, too, Tim. But this was

your decision. You have to act like

a big boy now.

TIM

Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

You'll be fine. Just be careful.

TIM

OK. You, too. I love you.

42.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Current risk mitigation mechanisms

available to hog farm operations

include futures and options to...

TIM (CONT'D)

I'm in here!

DEAN

(WHISPERING)

I know. This needs to be private.

(WHIFFS)

Whoa. Something didn't agree with

you, did it? Second thought, meet

me in the stairwell after you wrap

things up in here.

TIM

What the heck is going on here?

DEAN

You sound like my fuckin' wife,

Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX.

TIM

Are you drunk?

DEAN

Fuck yeah!

(calms himself, whispers)

Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to

finish our little confab back at

the bar. I figured some shit out.

(MORE)

43.

DEAN (CONT'D)

Like I told you, no shocker--

Helgesson's buttering you up to get

you in his camp, because he knows

you and me are close...

TIM

We're not close...

DEAN

Close enough. You're voting for me

for President, right?

TIM

No I'm not.

DEAN

Well anyway, there's a petition

going around trying to take away

your company's Two Diamond Awards.

TIM

I know. I heard.

DEAN

Well hear this: After you left the

bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me--

Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he

asks do I want to sign this thing.

And I go, "Lemke might have been a

class-A deviant, but the guy was

tits as a rep..."

TIM

Pardon my French, Dean, but that's

a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill

Krogstad? He told me how you called

up Joyce Armbruster and smeared

Roger's name all over town...

DEAN

Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa-

whoa-whoa, that old whore called

ME. Harping about Lemke being a

pervert and how she wants to take

her business elsewhere. So I says,

"OK, I'll run some numbers." Well,

she calls back later that same day,

says she got Krogstad to lower her

premium. Which is all the greasy

twat wanted in the first place.

TIM

So wait, you didn't call her?

44.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

I may be a lot of things, but

poacher ain't one of `em.

TIM

So what's with this petition?

DEAN

Personally? I think Mike Pyle of

Shit started the thing as a way to

drive down the price of your

agency. Dollars to donuts he wants

to swoop in and pick up Northlands

at a bargain basement price. And

you know what else I think? I think

Orin's in on the deal somehow.

TIM

What? That's impossible.

DEAN

I can't quite figure it myself, but

I know what I know. And what I know

is you're wading into some duvious,

er dubious, shit. Just be careful.

DISSOLVE TO:

45.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

FADE OUT:

ORIN

... In Your Name we pray Lord Jesus,

Son of God, Author of our Salvation,

our Redeemer, our Truth. Amen.

RONALD

Orin knows how to lead a prayer

breakfast, tell you what.

TIM

Hmm...? Oh. Yeah.

RONALD

Little overwhelming? All this?

TIM

Hello, thank you. I feel like my

head is gonna like...

(makes explosion face)

Y'know?

RONALD

Oh I hear ya L & C. Loud and clear.

I was the same way when I first

came to ASMI. The deciding which

break-out sessions to attend, plus

the politics, the pressure, the not

knowing who to trust...

TIM

Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss.

(ANSWERS PHONE)

This is Tim.

46.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD

Tim. Bill Krogstad. Got a call from

Orin Helgesson. Tells me he's

worried about you. Tells me you're

palling around with Dean Ziegler.

Laughing at his jokes, buying him

drinks...

TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)

I... No...

BILL KROGSTAD

What's the ONE thing I told you to

do? The one thing, Tim? Steer clear

of Dean Ziegler. GODDAMNIT, you're

lousing the whole thing up!

DIONE KROGSTAD

Bill...

BILL KROGSTAD

Not now Dione.

TIM

Bill, I... That Dean Ziegler-- he

was trying to warn me about Orin.

BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE)

Warn you about Orin? Orin Helgesson

has been ASMI Midwest Region

President for 13 years! He is a

LEGEND! And what do you do?! You go

and pal around with his sworn enemy--

who, P.S., is a drunken loser!

TIM

Bill, I'm sorry...

47.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD

I sent you to ASMI to restore our

image, Tim. One day into the deal

you're lousing the whole thing up!

(TO DIONE)

See how far Gladstone is from Cedar

Rapids, Dione. Look in the atlas.

DIONE KROGSTAD

You're not driving to Iowa, Bill.

This is your daughter's wedding.

BILL KROGSTAD

Oh cripes, you know as well as I do

that Polack's gonna head for the

hills the second he gets his papers.

But no, you want to end up in the

poor house, Dione, we'll go. Let's

just keep on cashing checks we

don't have...

DIONE KROGSTAD

We are going to our daughter's

wedding, Bill.

TIM

I didn't know I did anything wrong.

BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE)

Well you better try doing something

right, Lippe. Because if you keep

lousing up, we all by god starve!

And don't you tell me to calm down

Dione!

JOAN

I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I

only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care

for a Virginia Slim, Lippe?

48.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN (CONT'D)

Whoa, what's wrong?

TIM

Mm, I don't know. Only everything.

CUT TO:

TIM

He didn't have to yell at me. I

didn't do anything wrong. I'm

trying my hardest.

JOAN

D'you want me to kick his butt?

TIM

Could you?

JOAN

Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could

take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin-

jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah!

(TIM CHUCKLES)

So Lippe, how'd you end up in the

insurance game? God that sounded

dorky-- insurance game.

(does 40s-style Cagney)

Look here, see, how'd you end up in

the insurance game, see...?

TIM

You are freaky.

(laughs, then)

No, it's kind of weird how I got

interested in insurance, actually.

When I was six, my dad got killed

in a sawmill accident.

JOAN

Oh my God.

49.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Yeah. Not good. But after he died,

our insurance agent fought like a

tiger against the sawmill to make

sure me and my mom were taken care

of. And we were.

(BEAT)

The crazy thing-- our agent was

actually Bill Krogstad.

JOAN

No way. Really?

TIM

He had just opened Northlands.

Anyway, I remember thinking, this

guy's a hero. A real hero. So even

if he doesn't always treat me, like

y'know... whatever now-- I'll never

forget that.

TIM (CONT'D)

This river-- the Cedar River? It

flooded the whole city a couple

years ago.

JOAN

I remember that. Massive disaster.

TIM

People talk about the firemen and

policemen and that. But think about

all the claims in a disaster like

that-- how hard those agents worked

to make sure people's lives weren't

left in the lurch. We're talking

billions of dollars in damages,

literally. And claim by claim,

dream by dream, those agents helped

rebuild this city. I'm telling you,

it's a noble calling. I really

believe that.

JOAN

You realize you just made it sound

cool to be an insurance salesman?

You are a hero, Lippe.

TIM

Tss. I wish.

50.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

No, I can tell. You're the Superman

type. Kind of dweeby on the surface

but a real frickin' stud underneath.

They'd call you Insurance Man-- put

a big red "I" on your chest...

TIM

Well, even if you're being full of

it, thanks for saying that anyway.

JOAN

Well, you're welcome.

(THEN)

So can you fly me back to the

hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing

my arse off.

DEAN

I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd

Century is a stupid theme,

Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us

is even going to be alive in the

22nd Century...

ORIN

Oh, and I suppose under a Dean

Ziegler administration, we'd just

abandon E-Commerce and all that,

huh? What's your take, Ronald?

RONALD

End of the day, you know I'm a big

supporter of yours, Orin...

DEAN

Stab me in the fucking back why

don't you, Wilkes...

RONALD

Why would I stab you in the back,

Dean, when I'm telling you to your

face that I think you'd be a lousy

President?

51.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

Timbo! Sorry about that gigantic

boner I got while we were spooning.

TIM

We didn't spoon, Orin...

ORIN

To each his own, Tim.

(gives Tim a kind wink)

I'm teasing, of course. Well, I

gotta run to an Executive Council

meeting. You fellas really ought to

check out Mike Pyle's Prop/Cas

seminar...

DEAN

Pyle of shit.

ORIN

Mike's a dynamite orator. I think

you'd enjoy it. We'll see ya.

DEAN

Smug fuck.

(then, to Tim & Ronald)

So who's ready for a drink?

RONALD

It's 11 in the morning.

DEAN

(MIMICS)

It's 11 in the morning. Can you

believe this guy? C'mon Timbo,

let's get the flock outta here.

TIM

You need to leave me alone.

52.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MIKE PYLE

I'd like to share a humorous

anecdote. A gentleman is drowning

in a lake or pond, and he's 20 feet

offshore. Well, along comes an

actuary. And this actuary sees the

drowning gentleman and throws him

an 11 foot rope. And the gentleman

says, "But I'm 20 feet offshore!"

And the actuary says, "Well, I'm

meeting you MORE than halfway."

MIKE PYLE (CONT'D)

So Property/Casualty Insurance, or

Prop/Cas, it's one of the most

dynamic areas of our industry...

MIKE PYLE (CONT'D)

Ah, is there a Tim Lip in here?

There's an emergency call.

TIM

Hello.

VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)

(CHINESE ACCENT)

Herro Mr. Tim, my name Chin Chang.

There bad news about your fiance.

TIM

Millie? Something happened...?

VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Ah, you wise man Mr. Tim. She die

in horrible car accident...

53.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

... but her dying wish for you, Mr.

Tim, to get shit-face with Deanzie.

DEAN

Timbo! Turn around!

TRENT

Gentlemen! I will call security.

TIM

What the H did I ever do to you,

you a-hole.

DEAN

Come on bud, I was having fun.

TIM

I just wanted to hear your voice.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Brandy, no! Bad girl! Sorry, she's

giving me grief over this new wet

food. What did you need now, Tim?

TIM

Nothing. Nothing really...

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Well I for one feel like I ought to

be on the fire department, I'm

putting out so many fires. Lucy

Kofnetka asked me to do altar guild

for her. Again.

54.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Oh.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Patti told me Lucy's seeing some

guy who doesn't even go to church,

so she apparently feels no need to

maintain her responsibil... Brandy!

No! She's going number two on the

floor! No! You get outside! I'll

call you later, Tim...

TIM

I'd like to sign up for the

scavenger hunt.

WOMAN

Super. Teaming with a co-worker or

are you in need of a partner?

(off Tim's look)

This is a team event, like the

Amazing Race. On TV? But instead of

going around the world, you look

for stuff in Cedar Rapids. And

instead of a million dollars, the

winning team gets a $75 gift card

for Westdale, which is...

TIM

Eastern Iowa's largest two-story

mall. I know. Sweet.

(a thought, a moment)

And yes, I do have a teammate.

55.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

Everything OK?

JOAN

Yeah, what was that call?

TIM

Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have

something on your blouse.

TIM (CONT'D)

Burn.

JOAN

(LAUGHS)

You are very weird...

TIM

(bad Elvis impersonation)

Thank you. Thank you very much.

(AWKWARD)

So, ah, I signed you up for the

Scavenger Hunt. To be my teammate.

In the Scavenger Hunt.

JOAN

Really? Why?

TIM

Uh, well I... Because Ronald

already had a teammate...

RONALD

Bill Hernandez?

JOAN

Taco Bill.

TIM

... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be

y'know, a decent team. So...

(then, firm)

I think you should do it.

JOAN

Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance

Man's sidekick. We're going to kick

some ASS!

56.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN

Like last year there'll be a few

physical challenges...

TIM

(TO JOAN)

I am super pumped!

JOAN

(WHISPERS)

Whoo-hoo.

ORIN

Course this should be considered a

fun event, in the spirit of team

building. You can find your first

clue "under the sea." By which I

mean in the pool area. So ready,

set, race!

TIM

You're going down, a-hole.

DEAN

Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic.

Get it, like paraplegic? But...

PERRY

Yeah. Good one, Dean-tard. Like

retard, but Dean-tard. Get it?

57.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Check it out-- Planet X!

TIM (CONT'D)

I compiled a ton of info on Cedar

Rapids. I've got a sweet laminator

in my basement.

JOAN

Ooh, that's hot...

TIM

(flips through his packet)

... Maps, area attractions, crime

stats, local customs...

JOAN

Look at you...

TIM

Bingo! Right here-- Planet X Family

Fun Center. Let's go. Act natural.

JOAN

What a gyp. There are no stinkin'

clues in here.

TIM

OK, I think we're going to want to

take Blair's Ferry Road to Avenue

C, then probably east on 100.

JOAN

Why would you possibly know that?

TIM

I memorized the major thoroughfares

and landmarks in the metro area.

MUSIC BED OVER:

58.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

(READS MESSAGE)

"You've seen the future, now Czech

out Cedar Rapid's past." But it's

Czech, like Czechoslovakia. C'mon!

DEAN

Know what that cow's thinking,

Pyle? She's thinking, "quit pulling

on my tits and fuck me already."

JOAN

Ugh. I'm gonna puke.

TIM

No, you're doing great, Joan. And

you look super awesome with a

wiener in your mouth.

59.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

(stunned, mouth full)

Oh my God, did you just make a dick

joke, Lippe?

TIM

No.

(giggles, with pride)

Maybe.

ORIN

OK guys, this is it. First team to

complete this challenge wins the

whole shootin' match.

(unfurls a scroll, reads)

ASMI's past is behind us; But our

future looks nice; Let's Build a

Bridge to the 22nd Century... by

scaling this silo of ice!

JOAN

That doesn't even... There's no

such thing as silo ice climbing.

TIM

No, it's actually a big thing in

Iowa. ABC news did a story about

it. I saw it on YouTube.

JOAN

Of course you did. Well, you can do

it then...

TIM

Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared

crapless of heights.

JOAN

You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz

I'm not climbing jack.

JOAN (CONT'D)

Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall

buildings in a single bound and all

that...

TIM

Yeah. Let's do this thing.

TIM (CONT'D)

Hang on... How's it...?

MIKE PYLE

Little help here...

TIM

Ugh. This is frickin' hard.

RONALD

Really hard.

DEAN

I think I just shit my pants.

61.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN

OK gang, that was Rick Martini with

the National Chapter. Here's the

deal. Since no one could do the

final task, and since Joan and Tim

were the first team to get here,

we're just gonna go ahead and award

them the first place prize. Unless

anyone's got a problem with that?

RONALD

Dangit. You could've done better,

Wilkes.

TIM

Wait, we won?

ORIN

Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75

gift card for the Westdale Mall.

DISSOLVE TO:

TIM

Oh crap. I forgot...

(ANSWERS PHONE)

Hey, Millie.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

I have been trying to reach you for

the last eight hours, Timothy. I

was going to call the police. Where

have you been?

TIM

I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for

this scavenger hunt, and check it

out-- we won! My teammate and I,

that is. Joan.

JOAN

Hi Millie!

62.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

That was Joan saying hi.

(beat, to Joan)

Millie says hi.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

I did not say hi. I didn't say

anything. If you had asked, I would

have told you that I've been at the

vet half the day because Brandy

swallowed a pencil eraser.

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)

Lucky for us it came out naturally

or we'd have been looking at

surgery.

JOAN

I'll just meet you inside.

TIM

OK. Sounds good.

(TO MILLIE)

Sorry Mil, go ahead.

MILLIE

So who's this Joan?

TIM

Just some gal from Omaha they

paired me up with. Between you and

me, she's a little different. Real

hyper-- one of these types who kind

of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar

gift card, I'm not going to

complain.

63.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)

You promised you'd check in with

me. I'm very disappointed.

TIM

(PLAYFUL)

OK, Mom...

MILLIE

Well. You obviously have more

important things to do than talk to

me. My brother and I were just

getting ready to go for fish at the

Eagles anyhow.

MILLIE (CONT'D)

Go warm up the car, Wade.

TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)

Mil, I didn't...

MILLIE

It's fine. You'll call me some time

when it's convenient for you, Tim.

Good Night.

TIM

Hey. What say we just use the gift

certificate to get a nice supper

here? At the mall.

64.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

CUT TO:

TIM

We have a gift card. But I didn't

make a reservation. Is that OK?

MAITRE D'

Right this way, sir.

WAITER

Coors Lite for the madam. A cream

sherry for monsieur. And here are

some bottomless bread sticks.

TIM

Nice. Thanks.

TIM (CONT'D)

To victory. To new friends. To life.

And all the joys of living it.

JOAN

That's really nice. Cheers.

TIM

Mm, it does taste a lot like

communion wine. Awesome.

65.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

LATER --

JOAN

So Lippe, I'm trying to figure you

out. Hopes, dreams, aspirations,

blah-blah-blah? Whaddaya got?

TIM

Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love--

some day-- to put a little

greenhouse in my backyard.

JOAN

Dream the impossible dream...

TIM

No, I've actually seen some fairly

decent portable ones at Fleet Farm

that won't break the bank...

JOAN

C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land

stuff. What do you really want?

TIM

Well. I always hoped I could take

over Northlands when Bill retired.

But that obviously isn't going to

happen now.

JOAN

Oh, screw him. He wants to sell,

why don't you just buy Northlands?

TIM

Yeah right.

JOAN

Why not? You could get a loan.

TIM

I don't... Probably not.

JOAN

You know the business. You know the

clients. You actually care about

your job. You'd be perfect.

66.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's.

(BEAT)

OK. What I'd really like is a

family. To be a dad. So kids, I

guess, that's what I really want.

JOAN

Yeah well, you can have mine.

TIM

You've got kids?

JOAN

Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight

next month. My little squirrels.

TIM

Awesome. Beautiful kids. And

that's...?

JOAN

My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met

when we were both Rotary exchange

students in high school. Lived in

Norway for a semester.

TIM

Norway.

JOAN

I was such a spaz. Band geek, total

ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the

whole nine. I didn't even get boobs

until college. Anyway, we ended up

getting married sophomore year.

Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and

here we are. Richie's a Supervisor

in the Parks Department now. For

the County.

TIM

Wow.

JOAN

I know it's effed up. And if I had

it all to do over again, I don't

know what I'd choose.

(MORE)

67.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN (CONT'D)

But I don't have that option. So

this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar

Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here,

and for a few days I'm someone

else. No kids. No husband. No

responsibility. Wild woman.

(an ironic growl)

Sometimes a gal just needs a

vacation from who she really is--

know what I mean, Lippe?

TIM

OK. I thought of another one.

JOAN

One what?

TIM

Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's

still small potatoes compared to...

JOAN

No, let's hear it...

TIM

... to all you've done-- Norway and

all that, but...

(BEAT)

Do you watch American Idol ever?

JOAN

You wanna be on American Idol?

TIM

No-no-no. Negative! Sheesh. But I

do enjoy watching it quite a bit.

Randy's always like, "That's

awesome, dawg!" And Simon's such a--

(mediocre British accent)

"Oh, I'm so superior."

(THEN)

Anyhow I was thinking of maybe

trying-- trying-- to get a solo in

my choir. At church. I mean, it's

all super political. But I'm a fair

to middlin' baritone, so...

68.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

That's great, Tim. You'll do it. I

know you will. Very cool.

JOAN

Wanna get one for the road, stud?

TIM

Oh no, I have to practice my Two

Diamond presentation. I can't...

JOAN

One nightcap. It'll loosen you up.

TIM

Ha. Nightcap. Kneecap, more like...

JOAN

What?

TIM

Yes.

DEAN

Timbo and the O-Fox! Wondered when

you crazy kids were gonna show up.

RONALD

Can I buy the big-shot winners a

drink? Coors Lite for Joan. And

Tim, you want a pop?

69.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Actually, do they have cream sherry?

RONALD

Cream sherry. Jeez, guess that

victory really did go to your head.

JOAN

Coors Lite's good for me, thanks. I

gotta run wash my hands quick.

DEAN

You tag that yet, Timbo? Bet she's

moist as a damp sponge, huh?

TIM

She is MARRIED. And you're just...

What is wrong with you?

DEAN

Shit, what isn't wrong me? I drink

too much, I weigh too much, I piss

people off. Speaking of, that crank

call earlier-- way outta line.

People are right, I am an asshole.

TIM

Well. Yeah. You kind of are. But I

guess I've seen worse.

DEAN

I love it! "I guess I've seen

worse." I love it!

(big laugh, then)

Yeah shit, s'pose we all wish our

lives had gone a little different.

You don't come into this deal

going, "Dear God, please let my

wife toss me out on my ass. Please

give my children the courage to

hate my fucking guts. Thank you

Jesus. Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!"

Ach, I'm just having fun.

(crosses himself, looks

HEAVENWARD)

No offense Big Man! Right, Timbo?

70.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Ronald! Hello.

(takes his drink)

Thanks mucho... So Ronald, what's

your situation? You married, or...?

RONALD

Negative. I'm pretty well married

to Ronald Wilkes Insurance. I also

do quite a bit of work with the St.

Cloud Chamber. I'm Senior Warden at

my church. So really, no time for a

Mrs. Ronald Wilkes.

TIM

Wow.

RONALD

Don't get me wrong, I have my

guilty pleasures-- antiquing, I'm

active in community theater. And I

have to admit I'm a big enthusiast

of the HBO program, The Wire. But

shux, I haven't had a proper

vacation in nine years.

TIM

I never use my vacation time.

DEAN

Maybe you two should take one of

those gay cruises together.

RONALD

You know what you are Ziegler?

You're what I call a real Richard.

RONALD (CONT'D)

Mr. Richard Head.

TIM

(titters as he figures it out)

Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a

total Richard!

DEAN

Ha! I love it! Richard head!

71.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

To Tim-- the young rookie comes in,

takes the scavenger hunt. That

right there is P-T. Prime Time.

DEAN

Would you rather toss a bum's

salad, y'know, eat out his butthole

or... give your dad a B-J?

RONALD

Come on Ziegler, this is supposed

to be a clean game...

TIM

No, if you used some salad dressing

a bum's a-hole might not taste that

bad. Thousand Island!

JOAN

Shots!

(to the bartender)

Kamikazes, good sir.

KARAOKE DJ (O.S.)

OK. We're ready for Tim Lip to rock

the mic. Is there a Tim Lip?

TIM

Did he just...?

JOAN

Why wait for the church choir when

you can take care of one of your

dreams right now, dude?

TIM

No, no, no, no, no...

JOAN

I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be

my hero-- Insurance Man.

72.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

KARAOKE DJ

Tim Lip? You in the house?

TIM

I, um, I've met some really, just

super neat people here. But this

song, I'd like to dedicate to the

first African-American person I've

ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at

the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander--

said hello and that. But... Anyway,

I just think you're one of the most

awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!

TIM (CONT'D)

(reading off the screen)

I was born and raised down in

Alabama. On a farm way back up in

the woods. I was so ragged that

folks used to call me Patches. Papa

used to tease me about it. But deep

down inside he was hurt, 'cause

he'd done all he could.

TIM (CONT'D)

(breaks into song, very soulful)

My papa was a great old man. I can

see him with a shovel in his hands.

See education he never had; He did

wonders when the times got bad. The

little money from the crops he raised

barely paid the bills we made.

MUSIC BED OVER:

73.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

The presentation's in 36 hours. I

can't afford to be off my game.

Frankly, neither can you, Tim.

RONALD (CONT'D)

This is ridiculous, you guys. Told

you, it closed an hour ago.

RONALD (CONT'D)

Tim. Come on. This isn't you.

TIM

Uh-oh. Who is it then?

RONALD

You know what I mean. We've both

worked our tails off. Why poop it

away on...

DEAN

Check this out-- Captain Nemo!

TIM

(TO RONALD)

I know. I just...

74.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

No frickin' way!

JOAN

Whaddaya say, Lippe? Take a dippy?

TIM

(GERMAN ACCENT)

Ich can nicht schwimmen. That's "I

can't swim." In German. And I

can't. `Sides, I didn't bring a

bathing suit.

JOAN

So we stay in the shallow end.

(starts removing clothes)

And neither did I.

TIM

Yow. Chilly. Ha.

JOAN

So.

TIM

Yep. Ha. Fun. Fun day.

JOAN

So.

TIM

Oh jeez.

75.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

You have tan. A tan. Tan line. You

have a.

TIM (CONT'D)

You. Are. You're. Married.

TIM (CONT'D)

I have a fian...

TIM (CONT'D)

Oh jeez...

DEAN

Hell yeah.

ORIN

What the heck's going on down

there?!

DEAN

Suck my ass, Helgesson.

ORIN

I'm calling security!

76.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Holy crap! We're so dead!

TIM (CONT'D)

I want to make love!

DEAN

Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet.

Wake up, man!

(NO RESPONSE)

Ah, fuck it.

TIM

Your body's just so... firm and

pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was

just super... super awesome.

TIM (CONT'D)

Wanna cuddle?

JOAN

Cuddle? Um. OK.

77.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

I love to cuddle.

(NUZZLES)

You're special, Joan. So special...

FADE OUT:

JOAN

No baby, you guys are playing at

Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next

week...

(LISTENS)

Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna

miss it. It's not that far. Put

your dad on.

JOAN (CONT'D)

Hey. Did you not look at the

schedule on the fridge? Did we not

have this conversation 10 minutes

before I left?

(listens, sighs)

No, no, no. The playoffs are in

Ralston. This is the last regular

season game. He actually has a

chance to play, Richie. Christ.

JOAN (CONT'D)

Fine, but watch your speed on 84th

by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's

gotten busted twice right there. By

that golf course.

(LISTENS)

Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love

you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick

some butt for me. `K. See ya.

TIM

Good morning.

78.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

Crisis on the home front. Sorry if

I woke you up.

TIM

No problemo.

TIM (CONT'D)

Is that...? Were you looking at my

Two Diamond presentation?

JOAN

Your cell phone kept ringing in

your little fanny pack thing, so I

shut it off. When I saw the discs,

I figured I'd take a look. It's a

solid presentation.

TIM

Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...

JOAN

Yeah, I see that.

(WISTFUL BEAT)

You know we were together right?

TIM

What? Whaddaya...? You and... You

and Roger, you mean?

JOAN

It's so stupid-- but everyone

basically treated us like the

Brangelina of ASMI for a while

there. It ended two years ago. He

was getting into some pretty weird

stuff... as we all know now.

JOAN (CONT'D)

Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter.

You knew, didn't you?

TIM

My foot I knew! No, I did not. And

yes, it most certainly does matter.

Man, this T's me off.

79.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

Tell me you're not jealous. You

can't be jealous. The guy's dead.

TIM

Every stinkin' place I go people

remind me: You're no Roger Lemke.

You're not as good as Roger Lemke.

Here we go again.

JOAN

As good? Tim, Roger was a small-

minded, egotistical jerk. You're an

infinitely better man than he was.

TIM

Why were you with him then?

JOAN

Why? I don't know. I don't know. I

guess I probably maybe don't like

myself very much. I don't know.

TIM

Hey, hey. Come on. You're pretty

and smart and just super awesome.

(COY)

I like you.

TIM (CONT'D)

Grrr. I'm so frickin' confused. Last

thing I thought was that I'd come to

Cedar Rapids and fall in love.

JOAN

What are you talking about?

TIM

Us. This.

JOAN

What this? What are you talking

about? There's no this. There's no

us. I have a family.

80.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

What about...?

JOAN

What about it? I told you, what I

do here... In Cedar Rapids... It

stays here.

TIM

Where the heck are my clothes?

JOAN

Come on, Tim. We're adults here.

You're acting like a child...

TIM

Yeah. Well, you're acting like a

fricking... prostitute.

TIM

I lost my slacks somewhere.

81.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

I'm really, really sorry Ronald. If

I said anything, or...

RONALD

Hey, it's not Ronald Wilkes's job

to judge you, Tim. End of the day,

the Lord's got that covered. But am

I disappointed? You bet I am. Heck,

I'm all for having fun. But I

didn't think you were one of these

guys who comes down here only to

get loaded and act like a derelict.

TIM

No, I'm not. I...

DEAN (O.S.)

Timbo! Ronimal!

DEAN (CONT'D)

You should have stuck around last

night, Ronimal. Watching Timbo and

the O-Fox get it on in the pool--

shit, I was harder than Chinese

arithmetic.

RONALD

What a couple of class acts. I'm

running late for the prayer

breakfast. Oh and Tim, Bill

Krogstad's been trying to reach you

all morning. FYI.

BILL KROGSTAD

Tim, Bill Krogstad again. Orin

Helgesson told me about your little

hootenanny in the pool there. Clear

violation of ASMI's Morals Code--

meaning we lose our ASMI

certification, we lose our Two

Diamond rating, we lose our

customers and I lose any chance of

ANYONE buying my goddamn business.

(MORE)

82.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

I may as well just commit

suicide...

PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

Father of the bride. We're set.

BILL KROGSTAD

(to Photographer, despondent)

Yah. Be there in a...

(INTO PHONE)

Call me when you get this Tim.

Because unless you pull off a

miracle, we're done. You've let me

down hard. Cripes... shaping up to

be the worst day of my life.

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

You look real beautiful, Kayla.

Like a flower.

TIM

Goddarnit!

DEAN

That time of the month?

(off Tim's look)

C'mon man, it's gonna be OK.

TIM

No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job,

my fiance...

(dawns on him)

God, I'm a philanderer. I've let

Bill down. I've let everybody down.

DEAN

C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down.

83.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN (CONT'D)

My ex, Patti? Well-established fact

that this broad is a serious

fucking cuntstain, right? But like

I say, she's made it pretty much so

the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad

guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old

daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh

yeah, happy day in the Ziegler

household, lemme tell ya-- who's

the one so depressed that she can't

get out from under the afghan on

the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's

the one planning the baby showers

and taking Meg to the gyno, all

that shit? The fucking Deanzie.

That's who.

TIM

Is this...? Why is this all of a

sudden about you, Dean?

DEAN

I'm telling you this, buddy, because

it shows to go ya-- even if you're a

fucking waste of space jerk-off like

myself, there's always opportunities

to do the right thing. If this Two

Diamond bullshit and that matters so

much, you'll find a way to make it

right. If not, fuck it. Life's way

too short to lose sleep over shit

that don't matter.

ORIN

Without any more ado, our keynote

speaker, Iowa Insurance

Commissioner, Mrs. Susan Voss!

84.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

President Helgesson, please let me

stay in the Two Diamond contest.

Please. This isn't for me-- it's

for Bill Krogstad. I can't let him

down. Please just let me compete.

ORIN

(self-deprecating, but proud)

Tiffany Suite. Bit much. Perks of the

Presidency, guess you'd say. Please.

Have a seat on the davenport.

ORIN (CONT'D)

Drink?

TIM

Ah, no. Thanks.

ORIN

Suit yourself.

TIM

This is the petition?

ORIN

Between you and me-- this was a

ploy by Mike Pyle. Trying to drive

down the value of Northlands so he

could get it on the cheap.

85.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN (CONT'D)

I just made that happen. Poof.

Gone. Rainmaker.

(makes rain gesture)

Northlands keeps its three previous

Two Diamond Awards.

TIM

Oh my gosh, really? Thank you.

ORIN

One thing Roger Lemke knew, Tim? He

knew that when you get all dolled

up, go to the prom-- the Big Dance--

that you gotta be prepared to put

out. To show a little teat.

(off Tim's confused look)

You ever hear of PayPal, Tim?

TIM

PayPal? Um, yeah. I've used it to

pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay...

(GUILTY)

For my fiance.

ORIN

Good. Thing you gotta ask yourself

now is this: "Am I ready to dance?

Am I ready to show a little TEAT?"

TIM

I don't understand what you mean...

ORIN

Calm down, Orin. I'm sorry. Please,

let's talk E-Commerce for a minute.

ORIN (CONT'D)

Four years ago, the brain trust at

ASMI National mandated we go "on-

line" for everything. Billing,

newsletter, the whole shebang. Now

I'm almost 70-years-old-- I's about

as likely to figure this deal out

as I was to learn Chinese. Well, as

you know Roger Lemke was a real

whiz on the computer...

86.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

You bet.

ORIN

So Roger's up here looking over

this new system, and he gets one of

these lightbulb-going-off kinda

looks, the way he did. And he says,

"Orin, with that newsletter going

digital you're saving almost four

grand a year in printing costs

alone. Four grand. Pure profit."

You see where this is going, Tim?

TIM

I can't say that I do...

ORIN

PayPal. That's where. What has ASMI

ever given Orin Helgesson? Huh? Not

dime one. Sure as shoot not an

opportunity to serve on the

National Board. Have I not been a

good President? Do I not deserve a

little something?

TIM

You're an awesome President...

ORIN

You're GODDAMN right I am!

ORIN (CONT'D)

But I don't know the first blessed

thing about this PayPal deal. Roger

had the on-line know-how, not me.

TIM

I'm still not reading you here...

ORIN

There aren't printing costs anymore,

see? The ASMI-teer's digital. E-

Commerce! Don't you get it, Tim? All

that money-- almost 39-hundred

dollars a year-- that goes into a

PayPal account now. My PayPal

account. But I've got no idea how to

use it.

87.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Do you literally mean you just need

help, like, getting on-line, or...?

ORIN

Your performance in that scavenger

hunt was first-rate. Then I see you

in the pool making love to that

floozy, I realize maybe you've got

a bit of Lemke's, shall we say,

moral ambiguity. I need that.

TIM

You're talking about stealing.

ORIN

Pontoon boats don't pay for

themselves, Tim. Roger Lemke came to

the prom. He showed me a little

teat. I rewarded him with the Two

Diamonds three years running. I'm

prepared to do the same for you.

What do you say? You take home those

those Two Diamonds, Northlands'

value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad

retires to his time share. Everybody

wins...

TIM

I'd be doing it for Northlands-- to

keep it in Brown Valley and help my

co-workers. To help Bill...

TIM (CONT'D)

What would you need me to do

exactly...?

ORIN

OK, marvelous!

88.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

Vote for Deanzie. Vote for change.

WOMAN

I'm good thanks.

DEAN

Well fuck you very much, Carla.

DEAN (CONT'D)

I can count on your vote tomorrow,

right Ronimal?

RONALD

Not a snowball's chance in Hades.

DEAN

You're all a bunch of dicks.

RONALD

(spots Tim O.S.)

Hey there, Hangover Harry. 18 hours

and counting. Got your guns loaded

for the Two Diamonds, partner?

TIM

Um. I... I don't know about that.

RONALD

Don't be nervous. You'll do fine.

There's a prayer circle tonight

before the entertainment program--

might help ease your mind.

TIM

I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just...

about everything...

89.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

KAY

Happy Saturday! What'cha drinkin'?

TIM

A large cream sherry, please.

KAY

Looks like you could use some

cheering up. What do you call it

when it rains chickens and ducks?

(PAUSE)

Fowl weather.

TIM

(DISTRACTED)

That's pretty hilarious.

TIM (CONT'D)

Another please. I have to use the

little boy's room.

TIM

Bree?

(off her confused look)

It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI

convention. We met out in front of

the Holidome across the street?

90.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

That's what you get from smoking

all those-- what'd you call `em,

heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just

kidding. Butterscotch?

TIM (CONT'D)

Small world, huh?

BREE

Totally. You wanna party?

TIM

Ooh, that's really awesome of you

to ask. But I have a super

important presentation in the

morning unfortunately, so...

GARY

I gotta work in the morning, too.

Can't be productive or whatever

without occasionally taking a little

ride on the good times express. It's

like, fuck that shit, yo.

TIM

Yeah. I hear that. L & C. Loud

and... clear.

BREE

Seriously. We're going to this

thing at my Uncle Ken's later--

after his shift's done.

BREE (CONT'D)

You look like you're in serious

need of some relaxation, dude.

TIM

I have had a pretty messed up day

actually. Might not hurt to forget

about it for a little while.

91.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN

My advice, Mike? Pull the trigger.

I've pretty well convinced him that

his company's in the crapper. 85-

thousand is as low as I could

possibly get him.

MIKE PYLE

He's said nothing to indicate I'd

have to hang onto his employees or

the office up there, right?

ORIN

Bill was real clear about that.

You're buying his clients-- not his

brand. You've done this before,

Mike. The Northlands policies will

simply roll over into your Allstate

office in Milwaukee. Unless you

want to keep a satellite branch up

there in North Palookaville.

MIKE PYLE

(CHUCKLES)

OK. Let's pull the trigger.

ORIN

Oh, and Mike-- we're square on my

consultant's fee?

MIKE PYLE

Ten percent, as agreed.

ORIN

Marvelous. Now just give me a

second here...

ORIN

We're all systems go over here,

Bill.

92.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE)

Praise Christ! This is super, Orin!

ORIN

I was able to get Pyle up to 81-

thousand for you, Bill, which is

pretty amazing given all the... the

tribulations and that. Of course

that number doesn't include my 15

percent consultant's fee.

BILL KROGSTAD

Y'know what Orin, it's only a seven

hour drive to Cedar Rapids. If I

leave right now, I can be there

first thing in the A-M and we can

lock this sonofagun down.

ORIN (O.S. ON PHONE)

I wouldn't want to put you out,

Bill, but it would be nice to put

pen to paper on a contract sooner

than later.

BILL KROGSTAD

Hell yes. You bet. It's no problem.

I'll be there in time to see the

Two Diamond presentations-- not

that that matters to me anymore!

Thanks a million, Orin!

BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)

Dione, the deal's going through! 81-

grand! We're getting this albatross

off our backs after all. I'm going

to Cedar Rapids.

DIONE KROGSTAD

No, Bill...

BILL KROGSTAD

Goddamnit, Dione, not now. This is

happening. No flex on this one!

93.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR

... You can't handle the truth!

JOAN

We used to get bands, Ronald. Real

bands. Kansas. REO Speedwagon...

Remember REO let me get on stage

and play tambourine?

RONALD

I'll go ahead and admit, this is an

odd choice for an ASMI headliner.

Budget crunch, I guess.

JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR

Danny isn't here Mrs. Torrance!

DEAN

Are you ready for this? Mike Pyle of

Shit just bought Northlands. Word is

the cocksucker's liquidating Timbo

and the whole Brown Valley

operation.

RONALD

What? Holy smokes. Does Tim know?

JOAN

Don't look at me. I don't think Tim

likes me very much anymore.

DEAN

Cry me a fucking river, honey. This

isn't about you for once.

JOAN

Fuck off, Dean. Jackass.

RONALD

Hey. Come on you guys. Cut it out.

94.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR

I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm

just going to bash your brains in.

DEAN

You two are a couple of serious

fucking downers, man. Timbo left

here in a huff a few hours ago--

you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he

already knew. Shit, the kid's one

of my best friends...

RONALD

You met him two days ago, Ziegler.

DEAN

Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not

my fault you're too goddamn afraid

to open up and tell another man you

love him. Do what you want, but the

Deanzie's gonna make sure his

friend is doing OK.

TIM

That must be pretty all right, Ken,

getting half off at Applebee's all

the time. I'd only weigh like 10-

thousand pounds...

UNCLE KEN

Pass me that cube, Skeet.

TIM

Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm

guessing?

95.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BREE

Suck the glass dick, dude.

TIM

Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.

BREE

A butterscotch might help.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)

Hello.

DEAN

Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I

talking to?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)

This is Kay over at the Applebee's.

Your friend left his phone here.

DEAN

That right? Is he there now?

KAY (O.S. ON PHONE)

No he's not. Be honest, I was kinda

worried about the little guy...

TIM

I FEEL AMAZING! THIS IS AWESOME!

BREE

HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE ON YOU?

96.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

AH, CASH-WISE? ABOUT 90 DOLLARS, I

THINK. I'VE GOT A TON OF TRAVELER'S

CHECKS, THOUGH. WHY?

BREE

I'LL GET US SOME MORE CRYPTO. THEN

YOU CAN FUCK ME IF YOU WANT.

TIM

(not sure he heard right)

DO WHAT NOW?

BREE

JUST GIMME A HUNDRED.

KAY

Like I say, he was pretty ripped

from all that sherry. He left with

Ken and them for some party.

DEAN

Who's Ken?

KAY

(CONSPIRATORIAL)

Ken's our cook. We all think he

deals dope, though. I get along

good with everyone. But Ken? He's

just real different.

RONALD

Oh jeez. D'you know where they were

going? Any idea?

KAY

You could try Ken's place. It's way

out in the boonies...

97.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

My mom became real protective of me

after my dad passed. She didn't

really let me play sports or any of

that. Fact, if I think about it, I

never really did much of anything.

Except gardening, which I do enjoy.

BREE

Well you're livin' now. Here.

BREE (CONT'D)

I bought some pills, too. Here.

These'll make you feel better.

TIM

Thanks. It's funny, though, because

my job is all about protecting

other people's dreams. But what

about my dreams?

BREE

It could be like-- maybe...

(does another line)

Whoa, shit's tight... Like maybe it

has to do with your parents both

dying? Like, maybe by protecting

other people-- it's like you're

trying to save your parents. Like

somehow you feel like it's your

fault? Like in your sub-conscience?

BREE (CONT'D)

And so you're not really like,

living your own life fully? But

dude, let me tell you this: the

only real insurance in this life--

is love.

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh baby, c'mere. C'mere.

(HUGS TIM)

You can fuck my ass if you want.

Oh man. This place is bad news.

WASTED TEEN GIRL

Faggot. Watch out.

I'll be standing by `case things

get squirrelly in there. Getaway

vehicle type scenario.

99.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

So you're sending me into that

shithole? How chivalrous, Dean.

RONALD

You and me can go in, Joan. It'll

be fine, I'm sure...

GARY

Nice tits.

JOAN

(not missing a beat)

Thanks. Thank you. That's nice.

RONALD

We don't want any trouble, guys.

We're just looking for our friend.

DEAN

Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to

paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags

we'll leave tonight...

100.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

JOAN

Oh shit.

BREE

But he paid for it, Uncle Ken...

UNCLE KEN

You can't let some dude pay for

crystal meth and an ass fuck with a

traveler's check, Bree. That shit

can be traced.

TIM

(WHEEZING)

It's fully insured. 100 percent.

(THEN)

And we didn't make love...

UNCLE KEN

Shut the fuck up.

RONALD (O.S.)

Hey! HEY!

RONALD (CONT'D)

(hard-core gangsta speak)

I may look like some suit wearin'

businessman to y'all. Truth is, I'm

straight up gangsta. And I always

keeps one in the chamber...

(indicates the bulge in his pocket)

... in case you ponderin'. So I

suggest for the time being that you

let my nigga be. Muthafucka.

RONALD (CONT'D)

Indeed.

101.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

Oh fuck!

RONALD

Run!

DEAN

What the fuck happened?

JOAN

Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK?

TIM

(JITTERY)

I don't know. I don't know. All I

know is I was getting kicked and

then Ronald was there talking like

a ghetto person...

102.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

In order to extricate Tim from what

was clearly a volatile situation, I

did, in fact, rely on my community

theater training. I don't like to

brag, but I do a pretty convincing

Omar from the HBO program, The Wire.

(beat, as a gangsta)

Least them crackers back yonder

seemed to buy it.

DEAN

The Ronimal!

TIM

I can't believe Bill would do this

to me. He was like a father...

DEAN

Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's

the real devil in this deal.

JOAN

You'll find another job, Lippe.

Maybe even move to a new town.

RONALD

Shoot, you could come work for me

if you wanted.

TIM

I love you, Joan.

JOAN

(to Dean & Ronald)

Get some sleep you guys. I'll stay

up with him-- make sure he doesn't

chew his arm off.

103.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

Sleep good, little friend.

TIM

I didn't make love to Bree, Joan.

JOAN

It doesn't matter. Here, lie down,

Lippe.

JOAN (CONT'D)

(SINGS QUIETLY)

Oh dear, what can the matter be

Johnny's so long at the fair. He

promised to bring me a pocket of

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly

we'll be doin' it right!

TIM

I always wanna call you "friend!"

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly...

TIM (CONT'D)

Careful. It's super slippery.

TIM (CONT'D)

Whoop. Careful now.

105.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

ORIN

(terrified, through gag)

Nmmmmmmmmm!

TIM

I did a ton of research on hog farm

risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they

might bite you a little if they

think you're a food source. But

there's never been a recorded hog-

bite death. So...

TIM (CONT'D)

The Two Diamonds may be meaningless

to you and Bill. But there are

people who care about this stuff.

Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest,

good people. I'll come back for you

after the Two Diamonds have been

handed out to a legitimate winner.

I'm really sorry about this, Orin,

but the insurance industry deserves

better than you.

WIFE

Who the heck's calling at this hour

on a Sunday morning?

HUSBAND

Hello.

TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)

Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your

insurance agent. How's Pam and the

girls?

106.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

HUSBAND

(whispers to wife)

Tim Lippe.

(TO TIM)

Um, fine, Tim. We're fine.

Everything OK by you?

TIM

Well, I think everything's OK. Hope

it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's

why I'm calling...

DISSOLVE TO:

RONALD

People sometimes say that promises

are cheap. You know what Ronald

Wilkes says to that? N-S-F. Not so

fast. At the end of the day, a

man's word is a sacred creed. And

the word I give you at Ronald

Wilkes Insurance is-- I will work

for you. Thank you.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER

Once again folks, President

Helgesson left a note under my door

this morning saying he had to leave

ASMI early due to a family

emergency. I haven't been able to

reach him on his mobile, but

obviously our thoughts and prayers

go out to Orin and his family.

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER (CONT'D)

(a moment of silence)

Now... we're set to hear our final

Two Diamond presenter. Tim Lip from

Northlands Insurance. Tim?

DEAN

Hey Travis, I don't think Tim...

TIM

(SEVERELY COUGHS)

Thank you. I'm Tim Lippe. Hog farm

risk mitigation... What is...?

TIM (CONT'D)

Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

(a few chuckles)

So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I

met, sorry woman, I guess. She's

23. She takes drugs, and I think

might be some kind of prostitute.

(a collective gasp)

But she's super insightful. Y'know

what she said to me last night?

Said the only real insurance is

love. That's fricking INTENSE,

isn't it...?

TIM (CONT'D)

I'm... ah... Our only true safety

net. Love. Crazy. I believe in

insurance. I believe in love...

TIM (CONT'D)

Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former

boss, everybody.

108.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

BILL KROGSTAD

(JAW-CLENCHED SMILE)

What're you doing, Lippe?

TIM

Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't

understand.

TIM (CONT'D)

Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do

it? Why'd you lie, Bill?

BILL KROGSTAD

(to the audience)

Sorry, folks. Guess it's against

the law now for a business owner to

sell his own business. Must've

missed that constitutional

amendment.

TIM

Insurance isn't just a business,

Bill. Insurance is personal. I've

got some savings. I could've gotten

a loan. We could've worked

something out.

BILL KROGSTAD

(still playing to the crowd)

Yeah, there's a guy you want

running an agency, isn't it?

(THEN)

Come on, Tim, you're tired. You're

looking foolish here. You couldn't

run an agency if your life depended

on it.

TIM

Screw you, Bill. Screw you... hard.

(GATHERS STRENGTH)

That's a bunch of dog crap. You and

Lemke, that... fucking pervert...

you stole my ideas and called them

your own for years. And I didn't

say squat-- because I figured we

were like a family. I may not have

quite as many clients as Roger had.

But my people are loyal, Bill.

(MORE)

109.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM (CONT'D)

I care about them. And guess what,

they care about me. Fact, I've

called more than half of them

already this morning...

BILL KROGSTAD

Watch yourself, Lippe...

TIM

I knew which ones would be on their

way to church, which ones I'd be

waking up, which ones probably got

a little blotto last night and

might be hung over... And every

single person I talked to-- every

one-- is staying with me.

BILL KROGSTAD

You don't know what you're doing.

TIM

I do actually. I do know, Bill. And

before the day is out, I'll have

called all my clients. All of them.

(to Mike Pyle)

So hey, congratulations Pyle of

Shit-- you just bought a company

that's losing half its business.

DEAN

Fuck yeah Timbo!

ORIN (O.S.)

Right there, officer. That's him.

JOAN RONALD

DEAN

What's the fucking charge?

TIM

Here.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

DEAN

What's this?

TIM

You'll figure it out.

FADE TO BLACK:

TIM

I know what you're thinking--

thinking "this wiseacre's full of

baloney." Am I right?

TIM (CONT'D)

But I'm telling you Reginald,

you're actually a perfect candidate

for term life...

GUARD

Tim Lip?

REGINALD

He pronounce it like Lippy.

GUARD

Well, you're outta here, Lippe.

TIM

I'm serious. Call any time-- on the

mobile or home phone, though. The

office number's no good anymore.

REGINALD

Thanks Tim. You're all right.

111.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

TIM

Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one

butt rammed me or whatever in

there.

DEAN

"Butt ram!" I love it!

DEAN (CONT'D)

Want your get out of jail free card

back?

TIM

Not particularly.

DEAN

When I saw it, at first I was like,

shit am I supposed to take money

out of the account, or what?

TIM

Did you?

DEAN

Nah, it was more fun watching the

smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat

his pathetic ass out if he didn't

drop the charges against you.

TIM

(a genuine smile)

Sweet.

112.

Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09

RONALD

It's not as cool as I thought it'd

be. I don't think this is even real

wood.

DEAN

(lacking his usual energy)

I'll show you some real wood.

TIM

Well.

JOAN

Deep subject. D'aar. Get it?

(punches his arm)

I told you you were a hero, Lippe.

Insurance Man saves the day!

TIM

Tss. Ruined it more like.

JOAN

True sign of a good day.

DEAN

Well, pal, it's been real.

TIM

(CHOKES UP)

I'm gonna miss you guys.

RONALD

Yeah. You bet.

DEAN

Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a

truckload selling these little

scented pine trees all the ragheads

hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe

that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet

cottage up on Lake of the Woods.

Canada? I can use it whenever I

want.

TIM

I think it sounds awesome.

RONALD

Actually, me too. The Ronimal could

use a vacation.

DEAN

Done.

JOAN

So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that

good stuff.

TIM

You bet. You bet. You too.

JOAN

If you're ever-- not that you would

No, you probably won't.
