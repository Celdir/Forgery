WHO'S YOUR DADDY

Written by

Maria Veltre & Jack Sekowski

TED NELSON (V.O.)

On any given day, your life can

change in the blink of an eye.

It's a cliche, I know...

TED (V.O.)

...But a lot of cliches get to be

cliches because they're true. Your

life CAN change in the blink of an

eye.  What I mean is, one day

you're a regular chump, a wannabe

something.  You're not even totally

sure WHAT you wannabe...

TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...The next day the doorbell rings

and some stranger's holding your

ticket to being SOMEBODY.

TED (V.O.)

It happens every day.  Dreams come

true.  And not just for those dim

witted chain-smoking hillbillies

you see on TV.  You know, the ones

who win the Super Lotto and spend

their fortune on a truck full of

Goobers and a new set of front

teeth.  It could happen to any guy,

any time...even ME.

TED (V.O.)

Uh, that's not me.  I'm over here.

TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You're disappointed, I know. I

admit, I was hopeless back then.

The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I

always had good taste in women.

TED (V.O.)

That's Christy Malone.  Head

cheerleader, love of my life, lust

of my loins.

CHRISTY

"Health Teacher Flunks Her Own

Lesson!"  No WAY!  It's Miss Pratt,

smoking a doobie!

CHRISTY (CONT'D)

Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we

did THIS in the school paper!

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)

Hand them over! Immediately!

TED (V.O.)

Look at that smile.  That wink.

That's no platonic wink. That's a

wink that says, "I don't just want

you, Ted. I NEED you." So of course

I had to ask her to the prom. I

mean, she was practically begging

for it.

CHRISTY

Just the guy I've been looking for.

TED

I've been looking for you, too.

CHRISTY

Wouldn't it be awesome if we were

about to say the exact same thing?

TED

(sotto)

From your lips, to God's ears.

CHRISTY

You go first.

TED

Ladies first.  I insist.

CHRISTY

Well. The prom's coming up.

TED

Yeah?

CHRISTY

And I was wondering.

TED

Yeah?

CHRISTY

If you don't have...I mean...

CHRISTY (CONT'D)

Teddy? Would you please please

please take me to the prom?

TED

SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of

course I will...of course.

CHRISTY

You are the most wonderful guy in

the whole wide world, and I love

you madly, Teddy Nelson!

SMASH CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

Sorry about that.  A cheap trick, I

know.  But it's my story and my

fantasy. So cut me some slack.

CHARLIE

Come on, bro. Spare yourself the

humiliation, the degradation...

TED

You and your pep talks.

CHARLIE

Don't get me wrong. We can salivate

over all the Christy Malones of our

lives. Wishing we could devour them

like melt-in-your-mouth filet

mignon. But we're strictly

hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty

eight percent lean, is about the

best we can hope for.

TED (V.O.)

That's Charlie.  My best friend.

He's into beef analogies, partly

because he's a butcher's son, and

partly because, well, he's just

into beef analogies. What can I

say? He's also a photographer...

TED (V.O.)

...a very gifted photographer.

TED (V.O.)

The senior class voted him, "Most

Likely To Have A Restraining Order

Filed Against Him." But that's

another story.

TED

I genuinely think she wants me. I

feel a vibe.

CHARLIE

That vibe is from your wrist, pal.

You've been over-tenderizing your

meat, again.

TED

See? Did you see that?

CHARLIE

She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's

like a newborn with gas.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

The only chick more untouchable

than Christy Malone is Miss April.

(feminine voice)

"Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu

burgers, rainy nights, and riding

bareback.  My biggest turn-off is

cell phones during sex." Here's a

tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and

don't be stingy with the lube.

(winking at Ted)

Don't knock it till you tried it.

TED

Were you always this sick?

CHARLIE

One thing for sure, Christy Malone

ain't lookin THAT good naked.

TED

Someday, I'll find out.

CHARLIE

You have a better chance of being

hit by a Mack truck with a

refrigerated cargo bed full of

sirloin tip.

TED

I defy your hamburger theory of

life, and all of the unfulfilled

hopes and dreams it represents.

CHARLIE

That's crazy talk.

TED

I defy any and all limits.

CHARLIE

Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.

TED

(walking away; defiantly)

Any time, any day, a man can

completely reinvent himself.

CHARLIE

I'm warning you. This is an

official warning. Danger, Will

Robinson, danger.

TED (V.O.)

There's one more person you should

meet. Someone integral to my story.

TED (V.O.)

That's Julie Conroy. Unlike the

rest of these losers, she didn't

grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met

her that day. But already, she had

made a difference in my life.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt! What

were you thinking?  How could you

be so careless?

(reading)

"Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons

who Teach Us." That's the little

bastard's motto!

MISS PRATT

(summoning courage)

Principal Merkin, I realize we have

to teach the children that

recreational drugs are the devil's

work, but that doesn't mean we

don't dance with the Prince of

Darkness ourselves, every now and

again.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Ah, well, bravo!  That's just what

we'll tell the school board.

TED (V.O.)

Merk's punishment was cruel.

Expulsion without appeal. Or

working for me on the school paper.

The school paper would be torture

for a gonzo reporter like Julie and

we both knew it. But what choice

did she have?

JULIE

So, William Randolph. Your last big

scoop contrasted the popularity of

Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate

Snickerdoodles at the annual bake

sale.

TED

That's just one example. My

reporting has made a difference.

JULIE

Let me guess: retail sales of

little chocolate sprinkles have

gone through the roof!

TED

The school dumpsters used to

overflow to the point where the

stench was unbearable. My award

winning expose changed all that.

The city added an extra weekday

trash pick-up.

JULIE

Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?

TED

Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate

it that you got busted. I know the

school paper sucks in comparison,

but it's really not THAT BAD.

JULIE

Don't even tell me you're hot for

Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.

TED

Christy's a very talented

journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her

future.

JULIE

I didn't know they gave them for

Best Lip Gloss Retention During a

Blow Job.

TED

Me-ow.

JULIE

Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get

it over with.

TED

I have absolutely no intention--

JULIE

--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.

TED (V.O.)

So you see, this is really about a

triple-dog-dare. I don't even know

what it means. I just know, unless

it's a felony, a triple-dog-dare

pretty much has to be met with

immediate action.

TED (CONT'D)

Uh, Christy, I was wondering...

ALL STUDENTS

WOULD YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH

ME?!!!

CHRISTY

(through gritted teeth)

Ted, have you lost your mind?

TED

You like me. I like you. I guess

it's pretty obvious to everyone.

CHRISTY

I don't LIKE you. We're JUST

FRIENDS.

TED

But that smile.

CHRISTY

Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone

since I got my braces off.

TED

So you'll think about it?

CHRISTY

You really don't get it, do you? I

am genetically programmed to desire

a big, buff, manly man who can

defend and provide for me and my

yet to be conceived offspring!

It's, like, a caveman thing!

TED

So that's a maybe?

CHRISTY

The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER.

Except maybe in your dreams.

TED

In my dreams.  Of course.

(repeating; chanting)

This is a dream.  This is only a

dream.

JULIE

No, Ted.  This is an actual

emergency.

JULIE

I tried to warn you, William

Randolph. She's got stiletto heels

hidden in those Keds.

TED

But you triple-dog-dared me.

JULIE

It was for your own good, in a

twisted sort of publicly

humiliating way.

CHARLIE

One word, my friend. One word.

MEATLOAF.

TED

There's gotta be more to life than

meatloaf.

TED

If I never eat another bite of meat

loaf again, it'll be too soon.

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to

represent all that Ted hates about

his mediocre life and the world we

live in. He's what you'd call

clinically bummed.

TED

Why can't we have pot roast or

stroganoff or even a little London

broil? I mean, for god's sake, we

own a grocery store!

DAD

We heard about Christy, son.

TED

What is this? Does everybody know

everything I'm about to say or do

every freakin' minute of the day?

MOM

No cursing in this house, young

man. Use the strong vocabulary God

gave you.

TED

I don't have a shred of privacy in

this whole stupid town!

DAD

We understand your disappointment,

Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy,

provocative, voluptuous...

(catches himself)

We...uh...we understand your

disappointment.

TED

It's my private business! Mine!

MOM

Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We're

the good guys, remember?

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. Don't allow this

disturbing behavior to furrow your

collective brow. Ted's just

experiencing some post-adolescent

turmoil, coming to terms with the

whole "small town dynamic."

TED

I hate Xenia! I hate my life!

TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And until that moment, this was the

worst day of my seventeen and a

half years. And then it happened.

Three, two, one...

TED

Whoa! Sorry, mister.

ZUKERMAN

In a hurry, are we?

TED

I was in the middle of a

melodramatic exit. It wouldn't

really make a statement if I

tiptoed out the door...What are you

selling?

ZUKERMAN

Bad news.

TED

People pay good money for that?

ZUKERMAN

I'm just a messenger.

TED

Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad

news I can take for one day.

ZUKERMAN

It's about your parents.

TED

My parents? What do you mean?

ZUKERMAN

I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm

a blurter. Your parents...They

...well...they exist no further.

(off Ted's confusion)

Skinny-dipping. The Amazon.

Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.

TED

You've got the wrong guy. The

closest my parents have been to the

Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at

Epcot.

ZUKERMAN

Well kid, I'm speaking of...your

biological parents.

ZUKERMAN

The will reading is next Tuesday.

Naturally all of Ted's expenses

will be taken care of.

MOM

We have a truckload of strawberries

arriving on Tuesday morning.

DAD

(explaining to Zukerman)

We own a small family grocery

store.

ZUKERMAN

How quaint.

TED

(quietly; moping)

It's spring break. I don't want to

go to a will reading.

MOM

That's part of growing up, honey.

TED

What? Having spring break ruined by

will readings?

DAD

You know what your mother means.

ZUKERMAN

All right, I can give you two

tickets, prepaid, but you must be

there. There's no other way.

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. Allow me to accompany

Ted. I can assure you, I'll be the

level-headed sidekick to your angst

ridden teen.

DAD

I think Ted should take someone

older, more responsible.

MOM

What about Charlie?  You boys could

make it a little adventure.

TED

Charlie, at a will reading? What

did I do to deserve this?

DAD

I remember spring break of my

senior year.  Seems like a lifetime

ago.

TED

Dad, please.

DAD

Grandpa was so strong back then.

Working from the crack of dawn. So

proud of his peaches.

TED

Remember how you struggled through

that whole facts of life talk and

then found out I knew more than

you?

DAD

You're way ahead of me again?

TED

(proving it...)

It was the year of the rhizopus

rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm.

You sacrificed your dream to go to

the prize hog festival. And in the

end you saved the peaches and you

didn't have to slaughter your sow.

DAD

The lesson being?

TED

Sometimes you have to do stuff you

don't want to do. It's all part of

growing up. And it usually works

out peachy in the end.

DAD

I'm getting so good at this.

TED

You guys are my parents.

DAD

Of course we are.

TED

They didn't want me when I was

born. Why should I care...

DAD

Son.

TED

Well, why should I?

DAD

They had a rough life. Your father

was a bouncer.

Your mother was, well, a two-bit

stripper. There was no place for a

baby.

TED

I guess.

DAD

They did do one great thing. They

gave us our boy.

TED

Yeah.

DAD

Be a sport. How bad could spring

break in Los Angeles be?

TED

I guess we could go to Disneyland

or something.

DAD

Think of it as a rite of passage to

manhood.

TED

Like one of those "National

Geographic" specials with the

topless chicks?

DAD

Whatever helps you cope.

TED

I guess it's better than having

tribal patterns carved in my face.

DAD

There ya go. Always remember, focus

on the peach...

TED

...not the pit.

DAD

Always one step ahead of your dear

old dad.

CHARLIE

I wonder if this is what it feels

like to be born?

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Think about it...Long tunnel,

bright lights, it's full of vaginal

symbolism.

TED

Poor Freud, turning in his grave.

CHARLIE

Seriously, it's like we're being

reborn. We really could reinvent

ourselves here, just like you said.

Nobody knows about your massive

humiliation.

TED

Nobody knows about your mental

retardation.

CHARLIE

Nobody knows you barfed during

junior high school graduation.

TED

Nobody knows about your constant

masturbation.

CHARLIE

And nobody knows you're a virgin!

(after a beat)

Aw, who are we kidding...

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

...EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN!

TED

I think I'll reinvent a new best

friend.

CHARLIE

What are the odds of there being

ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?

TED

Astronomical.

TED (CONT'D)

Hi, I'm Ted Nelson.

CHAUFFEUR

I'm so terribly sorry for your

loss. Your father was a great man.

CHARLIE

Who the hell was your father?

TED

Well, Dad said...

CHARLIE

...A bouncer? Are you serious?

TED

Maybe he got promoted.

TED (CONT'D)

Don't. Touch. Anything.

CHARLIE

(shouting)

This is the life, baby. We get

ourselves some tail and we're

talking SPRING BREAK!

TED

Cut it out, before you break

something!

CHARLIE

For a guy about to try his first

Dom Perignon, you are extremely

uptight.

TED

We can't afford that!

CHARLIE

Don't you know anything about limo

etiquette? Everything in here is

included for our pleasure.

TED

Wait a second, I thought we were

hamburger guys.

CHARLIE

And like every hamburger guy knows,

when you get your one big chance at

the good life, you abuse every

second of it until they figure out

you don't belong there and kick

your sorry ass out.

TED

Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette

handbook, too?

CHARLIE

This is how the other half lives,

bro. Enjoy it while you can.

BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #1

Welcome, Mr. Nelson. You are so

very very welcome here.

BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #2

We feel your pain, so deeply.

CHARLIE

(to Ted)

Something tells me we're not in

Xenia anymore, Toto.

CHARLIE

I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted

best friend. We're so close, we

feel each other's pain.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

See what you do to me, baby.

HELEN

Oh my, he would have been so proud.

You're the spitting image of him.

CHARLIE

He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He

can't even get a good hocker going.

I've tried to teach him. It comes

from the diaphragm.

TED

(sharply; to Charlie)

You're on the next plane home.

HELEN

(emotional embrace)

I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's

executive secretary.

ZUKERMAN

We're running out of time. The

kid's here. We don't need HIM.

HELEN

Perhaps we could be patient for

just a moment or two longer?

ZUKERMAN

What did the doctor say to the

nurse as they watched something

black and white and red in a

blender?

(a wry smile)

No more patients.

ZUKERMAN (CONT'D)

Are you familiar with "Heaven?"

TED

I'm seventeen. I know it like the

back of my hand.

ZUKERMAN

Your fathered owned the entire

"Heaven" empire.  You own it now.

Any questions?

CHARLIE

Everything?  The publishing

division, the real estate holdings,

the retail outlets, the theme

parks?

ZUKERMAN

As far as the eye can see.

HEATHER

Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be

right there to hug the living

daylights out of you!

TOM

But if you're watching this, then

it means we bit the dust.

HEATHER

But don't worry...we'll be in

heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean.

Not that heaven is an actual place,

but more like a state of being. Or

not being. Who knows. Maybe we know

now.

TOM

If you're anything like yours

truly, then you probably figure we

didn't want you when you were born,

so who cares if we're dead? Am I

right?

HEATHER

But we did want you. It's just that

you don't always get to keep what

you want. We knew you needed a real

mom and dad.

TOM

We had no idea the nudie magazine

we started in the garage would turn

into all this.

HEATHER

Can you believe that was me?

TOM

Before we knew it, we created the

most popular men's magazine in the

entire nation. The rest is history.

HEATHER

So here we are. Dead. But we never

want you to want for anything. That

is, we want you to have everything.

TOM

Everything.

HEATHER

We love you, Ted. We always did. We

always will.

CHARLIE

I can't believe that's your mother.

We're talking babe-a-licious chub

fest, right here in the 501's.

TED

Perv.

UNCLE BILLY

I'm so terribly sorry.  Am I too

late?

ZUKERMAN

Ah, Mr. Deeds. You're just in time

to congratulate your nephew. He

inherited the empire.

UNCLE BILLY

(a broad smile)

Every morsel of it?

ZUKERMAN

It would appear so.

UNCLE BILLY

Smashing!  Welcome to the family,

Ted. You are going to breathe some

new life into this place. You are

going to set the world on fire! You

are going to...call me Uncle Billy?

Please?

TED

(awkwardly)

Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.

UNCLE BILLY

I have only one concern...

UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)

You do like girls, don't you?

TED

Of course I like girls.

UNCLE BILLY

A lot? I mean, a whole lot?

TED

As much as possible.

UNCLE BILLY

You're sure?

CHARLIE

(to the rescue)

He likes them with the unbridled

enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old

virgin who's been making mental

beef jerky since he saw the bevy of

tender young skirt steaks at his

new hacienda.

UNCLE BILLY

That's my boy!

UNCLE BILLY

The parties are held in here when

the weather dips below seventy.

Which is seldom.

TED

Seldom? No kidding?

CHARLIE

You said parties but you meant

ORGIES, right?

(to Ted; quietly)

Stick with me. I know their codes.

UNCLE BILLY

The orgies, exactly. Take a deep

breath. You can smell it. Pure

sexuality, oozing from the walls.

CHARLIE

Naked girls, wild sex, video games.

No wonder it's called "Heaven."

UNCLE BILLY

This is a fun place...but we don't

usually come here until after the

orgies.

TED

(playing along)

Ah, in other words, this is the

apres-orgy salon?

UNCLE BILLY

Indeed it is. During the day,

visitors prefer to be outside, au

naturel. As it were.

UNCLE BILLY

Hello, girls! Have you met Ted?

CHARLIE

This is like my every wet dream

come true.  I don't even care that

you're here, too, bro.

TED

Be cool. Fake it if you have to.

UNCLE BILLY

Good advice, Ted. You have your

father's instincts.

UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)

Just remember, you're not the man

you were a day ago. And these

girls, let's just say they'd be

eager to please you.

CHARLIE

I wonder how many of them will be

at the orgy tonight?

TED

This isn't some 80's porno film,

you dip shit. There are no wild sex

orgies.

CHARLIE

Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.

TED

Not ever. Never.

UNCLE BILLY

Never say never.

CHARLIE

Oh, god.  Look. Look.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

I really love your peaches, wanna

shake your tree.

Uncle Billy grins.

UNCLE BILLY

Maybe she needs help, Ted. You

should be a gentleman.

TED

(voice cracking)

I...uh...I think she's doing fine

on her own.

CHARLIE

(having a moment)

Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me

like you mean it.

TED

You kiss your mother with that

mouth?

CHARLIE

I'd kiss your mother with this

mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you

know...

TED

So far away? In Xenia?

CHARLIE

Yeah, whatever.

MOM

Teddy? Is that you?

MOM (CONT'D)

How are you, baby? Are you all

right?

INTERCUT WITH:

TED

I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in

Siberia, you know.

MOM

Did you have a nice flight?  Are

they taking good care of you?

TED

Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so

much to tell you.  I don't even

know where to begin.

MOM

Save it, honey.  We want to hear

every detail when you get back, but

we don't want you to run up Mr.

Zukerman's phone bill.

TED

It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.

DAD

Ted, it's your dad.  I have a

question for you.  I don't know how

to put it tactfully. You know I'm

lousy with words.

TED

Just say it, Dad.

DAD

I know they were simple people, but

did this trip help your college

fund at all?

TED

Dad, let's just say I can buy

anything I want in the whole

bookstore. Including the bookstore.

DAD

(not getting it)

Well, good. Every little bit helps.

CHARLIE

Check this out.  Hurry!

TED

I better go, Dad.

DAD

We'll see you soon.  Have fun in...

(trying to be hip)

...the land of fruits and nuts.

CHARLIE

Hurry.

TED

(to Charlie)

What is it now?

CHARLIE

Check it out!

TED

Don't tell me.  Another vision of

incomparable beauty?

CHARLIE

Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

TED

I get it now. You and me. We're

dead.

CHARLIE

Dead?

TED

Our plane crashed. In the Grand

Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We

never made it to L.A. They needed

dental records to identify us. And

this place. This. Actually. Is.

Heaven.

CHARLIE

Then there must be a whole room,

made completely of chocolate.

TED

And some really fast cars.

CHARLIE

Don't be such a pansy. All of this

is YOURS.

TED

It's a lot to digest. Imagine how

you'd feel.

CHARLIE

I'd feel like staying up all night!

Forever! Or at least till I got the

LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.

TED

I feel like I'm entering a

forbidden tomb...

CHARLIE

...where they get all the really

good porno channels on cable.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Cha-ching. Jackpot.

TED

Oh, how inappropriate is that!

CHARLIE

Take a whiff of heaven.

TED

How would you like it if I did that

to your mother's panties?

CHARLIE

I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck.

But this is different.  She wasn't

your mother mother--

TED

Give me those!

BUTLER

I do apologize, sir. I heard a

noise.

TED

We were just--

BUTLER

--I completely understand, sir.

I'll leave you to your business.

Good night.

CHARLIE

A couple of boys fighting over a

pair of red silk panties is nothing

compared to what he's seen.

TED

(sarcastic)

Yeah, he's probably been serving

cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the

orgies.

GINGER (O.S.)

Wanna take me for a ride?

TED

I-I don't have the keys.

GINGER

They're in the ignition, silly.

GINGER (CONT'D)

You do know how to drive?

TED

I don't have much experience with

a...uh...stick.

GINGER

Want a lesson?

GINGER (CONT'D)

Press your left foot on the clutch.

And turn the key.

GINGER (CONT'D)

Now release the brake. And slide

the stick into first gear.

TED

Got it.

GINGER

Now very carefully apply some

pressure to the gas pedal with your

right foot as you release the

clutch with your left.

GINGER

The first time can be awkward. You

just have to get on and try again.

TED

I don't even know if I should be

doing this. It's a very expensive

car.

GINGER

It's your car. These are all your

cars.

TED

Some of them have to be automatics.

GINGER

Your father liked shifting. He said

it brought him closer to the

engine. "Like a woman, purring with

ecstasy."

TED

I'm Ted, by the way. I think I

forgot to say that.

GINGER

I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.

TED

The one with the horses.

GINGER

That's me.

TED

I almost didn't recognize you

without...you know...that stallion

between...your...uh...legs.

TED (CONT'D)

That sounded so much better in my

head.

GINGER

Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?

TED

Shopping, really? I should tell my

friend.

GINGER

Don't worry.  He found the

chocolate room.

TED

(big grin)

Hi ho, Silver.

GINGER

Your father always said, "Money

matters only to the man who doesn't

have it."

TED

Sorry, habit.

GINGER

Who exactly ARE you?

TED

(uncomfortable)

What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

GINGER

And who IS Ted Nelson?

GINGER (CONT'D)

Is he a small town boy, destined to

live an ordinary life with an

ordinary wife and a tiny house with

a boring old white picket fence?

GINGER  (CONT'D)

Or do you have a taste for the good

life, Ted? It's in your blood.

TED

I always knew there was more. I

felt it.

GINGER

Then remember, you are the heir to

a billion dollar empire. You have a

staff of literally thousands.

Multiply everything you ever

imagined by a million and you still

can't even wrap your head around

everything that is yours. ALL

YOURS.

TED

I'll take the whole case.

UNCLE BILLY

Every one of these women thinks she

should be the next Angel of the

Month. It's your job, Ted, to

decide which of them is right.

CHARLIE

Let me get this straight...

UNCLE BILLY

If it isn't straight by now, son,

you probably should see a doctor.

CHARLIE

These are real, live women?

UNCLE BILLY

(winking at Ted)

We don't generally feature blow-up

dolls in our magazine. But hey, if

you think there's a market for it.

CHARLIE

God, I love being dead.

TED

I like her.

HELEN

(relieved)

Nice choice. There's only one

problem.

UNCLE BILLY

You think she upgraded?

HELEN

They went in through the belly

button.

UNCLE BILLY

We don't allow TIPN, Ted.

TED

Tipping?

HELEN

TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings,

nose jobs. Our angels must be pure,

unadultered, completely natural.

HELEN (CONT'D)

(emotional)

You have your father's eye.

UNCLE BILLY

There you are, Ted-baby. Everything

all right?

TED

Yeah.  Everything's cool.

UNCLE BILLY

You ready for your big coming out

party? Everybody's dying to meet

you.

TED

Just a couple of finishing touches.

My parents always said you never

get a second chance to make a good

first impression.

UNCLE BILLY

(puzzled)

They said that? Really?

(realizing)

Oh, your parents. The Nelson's.

Right, right. How midwest. I like

that.

TED

Truth is, I'm a little nervous.

UNCLE BILLY

YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should

you be nervous?

TED

All those people out there. It's a

lot of pressure.

UNCLE BILLY

Huh! You laugh in the face of

pressure!

TED

I do?

UNCLE BILLY

You are a multi-media magnate. The

Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of

Bottoms.

UNCLE BILLY CONT'D)

You are the Emperor of every little

girl who dreamed of growing up to

see her naughty bits spread eagle,

airbrushed to glossy perfection,

with staples through her ass.

UNCLE BILLY

You're the Sultan of Semen. The

Monarch of Masturbation. The

Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted.

Are the King of Coitus.

TED

Me? The King of Coitus?

UNCLE BILLY

The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.

TED

Whoa. But...that's the thing...

(he whispers)

I've never even actually...

UNCLE BILLY

(interrupting)

Why, look who's here.

TED

(sotto)

The Potentate of Poon has arrived.

CHARLIE

Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you

couldn't get to second base!  Now

you OWN second base!

UNCLE BILLY

I told you you could do it.

TED

I was like a different person

tonight.

UNCLE BILLY

You were the new and improved you.

TED

I would have been laughed right out

of Xenia.

UNCLE BILLY

No one will be laughing at you now,

Ted. You can take that to the bank.

TED

It's really going to be strange

going home in a couple of days.

UNCLE BILLY

You ARE home. But go ahead, finish

school, do what you feel you need

to do. In the meantime, I'll be

your point person here on the

magazine.

TED

Really? You'd do that for me?

UNCLE BILLY

I've been very lazy for a long,

long time.

TED

You seem like you're anything but

lazy, Uncle Billy.

UNCLE BILLY

(confiding)

I never finished school myself.

Never had to. My brother built this

empire from nothing but his wife's

perky tits and a whole lot of

gumption. He gave me a cushy job on

a silver platter. I never struggled

for a second.

TED

My parents always say hard work

builds character.

UNCLE BILLY

It's not like I didn't have ideas,

I had plenty of ideas. But I never

even shared them with your father.

Never had the guts.

TED

What kind of ideas?

UNCLE BILLY

Well...for one thing...I think it's

despicable that we exclude so many

women that only fit our western

notion of "classic beauty."

TED

You think we should be more open

minded?

UNCLE BILLY

The world is a big, beautiful

place.  We can open new markets in

Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali

Lhama reading our magazine.

TED

In other words, our scope is too

narrow.

UNCLE BILLY

At our press conference tomorrow, I

think we should announce our plans

to explore the world. Not just a

few leggy 36D's, with blond hair

upstairs and down.

TED

That's perfect.

GINGER

Want some company?

DISSOLVE TO:

TED

(posing; cool)

Who's your daddy?

UNCLE BILLY

...My brilliant, extraordinary

nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought

enough fresh blood to this company

to make all of Transylvania happy

for the next fifty or sixty years.

I'll give him the mike now and

you'll see what I mean. This apple

didn't fall far from the tree.

UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Don't forget to tell them all your

qualifications.

TED

I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already

know that part.

(proud of himself)

For two years I've been the editor

of the high school paper in Xenia,

Ohio. I've won some awards, made a

difference.

I've always had journalism in my

soul. Now I know why.

TED (CONT'D)

They tell me I've got my father's

taste in women and cars.

(winking)

The faster, the better.

TED (CONT'D)

And I'm really looking forward to

the challenge of bringing "Heaven"

magazine into the 21st century.

CHRISTY

He asked me to the prom! ME! We're

practically engaged!

JULIE

He reinvented himself into a dick.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

You don't even have your high

school diploma yet, Mr. Nelson. I'm

still the boss of you.

BABBLING REPORTER (ON TV)

The big question now remains: Will

success spoil Ted Nelson, the

straight-A journalism student from

Xenia, Ohio, whose life was

transformed overnight when he found

out he was rich, powerful, and

certainly the most eligible

bachelor in the entire nation?

MOM

(shocked)

Our Teddy inherited "Heaven?"

DAD

He said he was set for book money.

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. Forget about roller

blades for my birthday. I'd prefer

a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a

shadow of a doubt that I am not,

for example, a Guccione?

ENTRY WAY

Dad opens the front door to reveal

a delivery man, holding a flashy

new bike.

DELIVERYMAN

Delivery for Jimmy Nelson.

MOM

My goodness, who sent this?

DELIVERY MAN

It's from "Heaven," ma'am.

DAD

Ted. Of course.

JIMMY

(riding around)

I love you, Ted!

MOM

We can't accept it.  It's much too

expensive. Right, dear?

DAD

Of course, dumpling. Its very nice

of Ted but...

DELIVERY MAN #2

Delivery for Robert Nelson.

DAD

For me? What is it?

DELIVERY MAN #2

Appears to be tools, sir.

MOM

Oh, no. Ted's gone completely

overboard.

MOM (CONT'D)

Sweetheart, what is it?

DAD

I always wanted Craftsman tools. He

even got me the limited edition

Buckeye colors.

MOM

Oh, honey. We can't accept this

extravagance.

MOM

Teddy? Is that you?

INTERCUT WITH:

TED

Well? Surprised?

MOM

What is all this? When are you

coming home?

TED

Just a few tokens of my affection.

I'll be back soon, don't worry.

MOM

Everything is lovely, Ted, but much

too expensive.

TED

Mom. Believe me. I could buy all

that AND the factories they came

from.

DELIVERY MAN #3

Where do you want them, lady?

MOM

Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?

TED

Only the best for my mother.

MOM

(softening)

You promise you'll finish school?

TED

I'll make you very proud.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

You cannot land a helicopter in my

school yard! Get that blasted thing

out of here!

JULIE

What gives, Don Corleone?

CHARLIE

(smug)

We reinvented ourselves.

JULIE

New Hushpuppies don't make a new

man.

CHARLIE

You've obviously never had your

dogs nestled in thousand dollar

Italian loafers.

JULIE

That explains the emptiness that

haunts me.

CHARLIE

Jealousy is so unattractive.

JULIE

Second only to unfettered arrogance

and the inability to see the irony

therein.

CHARLIE

Wanna see my hickey from Miss

December?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I like you, Ted. You know that. I

liked you before you were filthy

rich.

TED

Thanks, Principal Merkin.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I'll be blunt. I know you can take

it.

TED

Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Ted, you are the best editor this

school paper ever had. You don't

need to be pandering flesh. It's

nonsense. It's beneath you.

TED

You think I ought to just tell them

thanks but no thanks? I don't want

your silly billion dollar empire?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

That's a good start, yes. A very

good start.

TED

Are you kidding? This magazine is

my dream. It's every red-blooded,

heterosexual male's dream.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I never figured you for a pimp.

TED

Have you ever even looked at

"Heaven?"

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

What kind of sick question is that?

I'll be watching you, young man.

Your money and power mean nothing

here. Nothing.

TED

I guess you won't be wanting that

Rolex I sent you, then?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

No. No, I won't. Thank you. For

reminding me.

CHRISTY

Great jacket, Teddy Bear.

TED

(hanging up phone)

Yeah? You like?

CHRISTY

Makes your shoulders look so big

and broad.

JULIE

A few billion bucks and suddenly

he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.

TED

It's so nice to have FRIENDS like

you, Christy.

JULIE

What is it, William Randolph? Your

balls need scratching?

TED

Your article sucked.

JULIE

In what sense?

TED

In the sense that there is no

"hidden agenda" behind a bake sale

that raised five hundred dollars

for seeing eye dogs.

JULIE

Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you

didn't even know it was there.

TED

Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You

have some real talent.

JULIE

Just because someone died and made

you king of the publishing world

doesn't mean you're even one ounce

smarter than you were a week ago.

TED

I'm trying to help.

JULIE

I'm still better than you. Nothing

changed except the decimal point in

your savings account.

TED

That's not ENTIRELY true.

JULIE

Oh, right. You're probably not a

virgin anymore. But as far as being

a hack, that much is status quo.

TED

What do you want from me? I'm

trying to be fair. But I can't keep

you on staff if you turn every PTA

meeting into an Agent Orange cover

up.

JULIE

Then I'll write about YOU.

TED

Me?

JULIE

"Local boy inherits more money than

god." Call me crazy, but I smell

human interest.

TED

(loving this)

Really? You wanna write about me?

MOM

Goodness...it's delicious. I've

never tasted anything so tender.

DAD

Beats the heck out of meatloaf.

(off Mom's look)

Although your meatloaf is second to

none, love muffin.

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. My trembling taste buds

have just been assailed by the

bittersweet knowledge of all

they've been missing these past

nine years.

JULIE

No offense, Wolfgang Puck, but dead

flesh is dead flesh. This just

happens to be better than most dead

flesh on the planet.

TED

Absolutely...heavenly.

CHEF

Why, thank you, sir. Thank you.

JIMMY

Ted has bettered our lives to the

point where I can no longer see

myself as "the old Jimmy" I was but

a day or two past. You may all call

me James. From this moment forward.

TED

Finally, some gratitude.

DAD

We're grateful, Ted. It's not that.

Those Craftsman tools...they're a

dream come true.

MOM

Your Dad and I were raised with a

certain work ethic, that's all.

DAD

We can't start living like we're

the Rockerfellers or something.

JIMMY

Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are

paupers compared to my favorite

brother, Ted.

TED

You don't have to work another day

in your lives.

MOM

But how would we pay our bills?

DAD

We just barely have enough for your

college tuition, son.

TED

Don't you get it? In one day I earn

more interest than the store's

entire annual revenue.

MOM

Oh. Goodness.

TED

You're free.  You can do anything

you ever wanted to do!

MOM

(after a beat)

Like what?

TED

Like take that trip to Buckingham

Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the

Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.

DAD

But those are our dreams, son. We

have to make them come true.

TED

Consider me your fairy godfather,

except without the fairy part. No

more mealy apples and bruised

bananas, ever, for the rest of your

lives.

MOM

But who would run the store?

TED

Forget the store. Think big.

DAD

Ted, we put a lot of love in our

business.

MOM

We wanted you and Jimmy to have it

someday. Something real and honest.

DAD

We love our lives just the way they

are.

CHARLIE

Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer

for "Heaven" magazine. And a very

cunning linguist.

TED

I have to admit, I always felt...

different.

JULIE

Different how? Different like a

dwarf at a basketball game? Or

different like a lesbian in pumps?

TED

I don't get the distinction.

JULIE

Could everybody else tell you were

different, or were you the only one

who knew?

TED

I felt limited. I felt confined. I

felt like I was suffocating.

JULIE

I see. So more like a tight rope

walker who secretly wants to be a

trapeze artist.

TED

I guess.

JULIE

Interesting.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Warm peanuts?

TED

No thanks. I prefer my penis at

room temperature.

JULIE

She said peanuts, you cretin.

TED

You never know around here.

TED (CONT'D)

Don't write that part.

JULIE

Is this an gritty expose or a candy

ass press release?

TED

Write what you want. Just try not

to make it so obvious that you're

crazy about me.

JULIE

(amused)

Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.

TED

Funny you should say "peachy."

JULIE

I did my homework. Your grandfather

was a peach farmer.

TED

My adoptive grandfather. Who knows

what my biological grandfather did.

JULIE

Undoubtedly an aristocratic

bartender of some sort.

TED

Considering this is your first time

on a private jet, on which you are

interviewing the world's most

eligible bachelor,  you are

extremely cavalier.

JULIE

I bet there are lots and lots of

mirrors on Planet Ted.

TED

See? You're impertinent, rude,

sarcastic.

JULIE

And this is not my first time on a

private jet, so quit acting like

I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

TED

A little respect would be nice,

that's all.

JULIE

Money can't buy respect, Ted.

Saying what you mean. Meaning what

you say. Being an honorable person.

That's how you earn respect.

GINGER

Great jacket, Teddy. It makes your

shoulders look so big and broad.

UNCLE BILLY

You do look smashing.

HELEN

Positively dashing.

CHARLIE

Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Oh wow, look...they've even got

baby gherkins!

GINGER

I have an idea! I'll be right back!

TED

Well? What do you think of her?

JULIE

You're so twitterpated you don't

even see the miner's hat and the

pickax.

TED

You're implying she's, what, a gold

digger?

TED (CONT'D)

Charlie's right. Jealousy is so

unattractive.

JULIE

Second only to unbridled,

narcissistic conceit.

TED

(whining)

Why can't you be nice to me?

JULIE

You've got enough people kissing

your ass.

GINGER

Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich

guys always wear flowers.

JAY

How are the hometown folks treating

you, back in Xenia?

TED

Well, Jay. They've been

exceptionally supportive.

JAY

Are they hitting you up for

donations? Asking you to sponsor

the local quilting bee?

TED

I'm no stranger to the notion of

philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has

long been one of my idols.

JAY

What about the future? You planning

to rock the boat at all? Stir

things up in "Heaven?"

TED

Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I

are planning to rethink the

magazine. To expand the traditional

western notions of "beauty."

JAY

I see, so you'd be open to little

ladies from Pasadena, who want to

show you their knickers?

TED

Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a

pictorial focusing on the women of

my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia."

Just to show my appreciation.

JULIE

The Girls of Xenia? Jesus.

JAY

Now you're talking. What did Andrew

Carnegie ever do? Open a couple of

libraries? BOR-ING.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)

Poochie?  Where's my poochie? Where

is she?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

Is my Poochie in here?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

Is she in here?  No.  Where on

earth could she be?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

There's my Poochie!  There's my

girl!

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

Poochie loves Daddy, doesn't she?

MRS. MERKIN

Breakfast is getting cold.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Thank you, dear.

MRS. MERKIN

No dogs at the table.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I know, dear.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

(weakly)

Thatta girl.

RADIO SPOT (V.O.)

How many times have people told

you, "Jeepers, you look swell

naked!" Well now's your chance to

go straight to "Heaven!"

RADIO SPOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Come on down for "The Girls of

Xenia" pictorial. Let's show the

nation our cows aren't the only

ones with great udders.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

This, my friends, this is not

"Heaven." This flesh rag is a one

way ticket to hell! We must voice

our outrage! To remain passive in

the eye of the devil is like

inviting him to a pot luck in your

own backyard and asking him to

bring the three-bean salad!

PRINCIPAL MERKIN(CONT'D)

For the sake of this community, and

its impressionable young minds, I

propose this publication be banned

from our city!

MAYOR

Thank you for that long-winded but

impassioned speech, Mr. Merkin. I

hope you can cut to the chase, Ted.

TED

With all due respect to Merk, he

doesn't have to read my magazine.

But he has no right to stop others.

(to Principal Merkin)

Ever hear of the First Amendment?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

(rising; an outburst)

We cannot afford free speech if it

excises the moral fiber of this

community!

TED

If that were true, this would be

one seriously constipated town.

Most guys in Xenia have been

looking at naked girls in "Heaven"

since they were old enough to

figure out their dads hide it under

the mattress.

JULIE

Isn't it true, Principal Merkin,

that you only care now because

"Heaven" is suddenly too close to

home?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Indeed it is, Miss Conroy! I make

no bones about it! "Heaven" has

gone too far!

MR. NEEDLEMAN

Principal Merkin is right! We can't

let "Heaven" violate our own

daughters, wives, sisters, mothers,

girlfriends, aunts...

TED

I wouldn't want to name names, Mr.

Needleman, or cause any undue

embarrassment. But many members of

this community have been loyal

"Heaven" readers for the better

part of the last two decades. Not

to mention certain charter

subscribers who have developed a

voracious appetite for our video

library as well. I don't suppose,

"Courtney Leaves The Convent" rings

a bell to anyone?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Mr. Nelson, you are Beelzebub's

henchman! You are single-handedly

destroying the integrity of our

community, and I will not have it!

I'll gather signatures. I'll

petition the courts.

MAYOR

(sheepishly)

You do what you have to do, Dick.

But if there's a man among us who

doesn't like to steal a look at

some pretty titty once in a while,

let him cast the first stone.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I. AM. THAT. MAN.

CHARLIE

You're like a centerfold waiting to

happen. And let me assure you, I

have some serious pull with the

publisher.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

What the hell are you doing?

JUDY

I'm an adult. I can do whatever I

want.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

My roof, my rules, young lady.

CHARLIE

Send us a picture, sugar.  We'll

get back to you.

TED

(greeting the women)

Hello there...Looking great...Very

nice.

CHARLIE

You're late, bro!

TED

Sorry. Ginger got a little, you

know, enthusiastic.

CHARLIE

You'll never believe who's in

there.

TED

It better not be my Aunt Trudy.

TED

Sorry to keep you waiting...

CHRISTY

Hi, Teddy Bear.

TED

Christy?  You want to be in

"Heaven?"

CHRISTY

I turned eighteen over spring

break. I'm eligible.

TED

I feel like I've just been hit by a

Mack truck.

CHARLIE

With a refrigerated cargo bed full

of sirloin tip.

UNCLE BILLY

So far, so good. Some of them have

real Angel potential.

TED

Really? So I'm doing OK?

HELEN

We're impressed but not surprised,

Ted. You have your father's

impeccable judgment.

TED

My father must've been amazing.

UNCLE BILLY

He was in a league of his own.

DAD

Sorry I--

TED

It's okay. You need me?

DAD

(holding a list)

Your mom said you've been ignoring

your chores.

TED

No problem, consider it done.

(to Uncle Billy)

I had this idea of shooting on

location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe

at some famous Xenia landmarks.

You think that would be a problem?

HELEN

We'll send you the release forms,

Ted. Our staffers will help in any

way they can.

UNCLE BILLY

You're the Titan of Tushies, the

General of Jism.  Don't you forget

it, Ted-baby.

MOM

You have to understand. This was a

big shock, for all of us. One

minute you're our little boy, of

whom we could not be more proud.

The next minute you're the owner of

this whole pornographic empire.

DAD

But that doesn't make you the boss

of everything, son.

MOM

Don't you see how your self

involvement and lack of humility

are affecting the whole family?

TED

I paid off the mortgage! I ordered

that Winnebago you always wanted!

Now you're ashamed of me?

DAD

You ordered a Winnebago?

MOM

We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We

don't approve of the magazine or

the models or the so-called "flesh

parties" you attend. But we can get

past all that.

DAD

We miss you. We miss our son.

MOM

We miss our family.

TED

I promised I'd finish high school

and that's what I'm doing. What

more do you want from me?

DAD

We think you should give up the

magazine. Sell it. Let someone else

run it. Whatever it takes.

MOM

We want you to go to college, find

a career you love, marry a nice

girl from a nice family, and live

happily ever after.

TED

THAT is your dream, not mine. My

dream is so far beyond anything YOU

PEOPLE could even imagine.

DAD

Watch your tone, mister.

TED

Why don't you just admit what this

is really all about? I'm not your

real kid and you can't control me

anymore.

TED (CONT'D)

No wonder I was so bored. No wonder

I hated this one-horse cow town. I

come from talented people who took

chances and dared to imagine a life

without limits! I was never meant

to be raised by...GROCERS.

GINGER

Teddy? I was thinking.

TED

Hmmm?

GINGER

After graduation...maybe we could

go away together?

TED

Whatever you want.

GINGER

I bet St. Tropez in July would be

paradise. For a honeymoon.

GINGER (CONT'D)

(snapping)

You could have warned us.

JULIE

Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got

lipstick on your teeth.

TED

Wow...you clean up nice.

JULIE

Put your eyeballs back in your

head, William Randolph. I'm on

assignment. A girl has to fit in.

GINGER

Teddy, I thought we were having a

moment here.

TED

Of course we were.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I apologize for interrupting the

festivities, but I have some good

news. I've been reviewing the rules

and regulations set forth by the

superintendent of schools. And it

seems quite clear...

(reading from manual)

"Minors may not be accompanied to

school functions by adults unless

they are their parents or legal

guardians."

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

So long, ladies. Prom's over.

TED

Honestly, Merk. It's like you were

never seventeen and the head of a

media empire.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Rules are rules.

TED

Come on, it's our only senior prom.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to

a higher power.

CHARLIE

Here's the deal, Merk.  Forget the

"rules and regulations" malarkey

and we'll give you seven minutes in

heaven with the Taylor Triplets.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Out! Now!

TED

What's your price, Merk? How much

will it cost to make you go bye

bye?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

You're crossing the line, Mr.

Nelson.

TED

A statue in front of city hall,

dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

I'm warning you.

TED

A new pediatric wing at the

hospital? A presidential campaign?

Name it. Anything.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

That's it! You're out of here!

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

Good-bye, Mr. Nelson.  Have a

pleasant evening.

GINGER

Ted! Do something!

TED

(restrained)

What do you want me to do?

GINGER

This is humiliating. We're being

ejected from a prom!

TED

Hang in there, I'll think of

something.

GINGER

Well?

TED

I guess...I don't know...I guess we

should leave if we're not wanted.

CHARLIE

I hear you, bro. We're Angus men in

a ground round town.

GINGER

This is what I get for playing den

mother in "Romper Room." Take me to

the airport, Charlie!

CHARLIE

Why don't you just hitch a ride on

the horse you rode in on?

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

(calling after her)

Don't forget your broom!

TED

I thought I loved her.

CHARLIE

Chicks are like buses. If you miss

one, don't sweat it. There's

another coming 'round the corner.

One of the Taylor Triplets bats her lashes at Ted.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

(whispering to Ted)

Take your pick. They're IDENTICAL.

TED

Everybody, listen up! This prom

sucks!  Let's party at my place!

TED

Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen

of 'em!

CHARLIE

No, leave one. Somebody's

grandmother might want one.

TED

And while you're at it, I'll take

ten dozen of those puppies with the

springy heads.

CHARLIE

I love those springy head puppies!

TED

You kicked us off your turf, Merk.

Don't rain on our parade.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me.

First you break our school board

rules. Then you break the law.

TED

What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting

down our hair on prom night?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Our state has a zero tolerance

policy for underage drinking.

TED

You called the cops on us?

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Alcohol does horrible things to a

developing young mind.

JULIE

Need a lift?

TED (V.O.)

Where are we going?

JULIE (V.O.)

To the best hiding place in the

world.

TED

I can't believe your dad built this

for you.

JULIE

He didn't. He had it built.

TED

Whatever.

JULIE

Not "whatever."  It's two different

things.

TED

He cared enough to want you to have

it.

JULIE

He phoned it in.

TED

I see.

JULIE

I doubt it.

TED

Now it makes sense, the whole neo

Bohemian, down with hypocrisy,

fight the power crap. You're a poor

little rich girl.

JULIE

The ozone must be fully depleted on

Planet Ted.

TED

You think my dad would have been

like that if I knew him? You think

he would have bought me a stadium,

instead of teaching me how to play

ball?

JULIE

Your dad taught you everything.

TED

I mean my father.

JULIE

A father is nothing but sperm, Ted.

It takes a real man to be a dad.

TED

It's all so complicated.

JULIE

It's incredibly simple.

TED

I feel like I'm being drawn and

quartered. Like every part of me is

being pushed and pulled and tugged

in a different direction.

JULIE

Eventually you'll let go.

TED

And then what?

JULIE

Then you'll see who's really

holding on to you.

TED

You're amazing.

JULIE

I know.

TED

Even when you infuriate me, I still

want to kiss you.

JULIE

But you never do.

TED

If we were a team, we could do

anything. I mean, anything.

JULIE

Cut to the chase, William Randolph.

Your audience is way ahead of you.

TED

In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.

JULIE

That's two words. And I'm out of

the "exposed" business, remember? I

need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a

boy scout.

TED

There's gotta be something. We have

to dig deeper.

JULIE

You forget, I dislike YOU at least

as much as him.

TED

He shut down your paper!  You're

stuck writing articles about swap

meets and raffles and PTA brunches!

JULIE

A good journalist can take lemons

and make lemonade. I'm honing my

craft.

TED

Then you won't mind covering that

watermelon seed spitting contest

next week...

JULIE

See what I mean. He's squeaky

clean. He makes Gandhi look like a

war monger.

TED

I have a great idea.  Let's lose

the last button.

FEMINIST

The city tower belongs to the city,

not to some pornographer.

MAYOR

The library also belongs to the

city.  And guess what?  It's going

to have a new Ted Nelson wing with

three thousand children's books.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

You should be ashamed, young lady!

Your body is a sacred temple!

PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)

Young lady, I will pray for god's

mercy upon your soul.

MOLLY

Don't bother, Merk! I'm already

going to "Heaven!"

TED

(to Charlie)

Get them together.

CHARLIE

(eyes lighting up)

Brilliant!  Molly, give me all

you've got.  For Merk.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Stop that, stop that this instant!

TED

I never saw anybody turn so many

shades of red.

UNCLE BILLY

I can't wait to see the pictures.

TED

It was incredible. The light, the

crowd, everything.

UNCLE BILLY

Such enthusiasm. Have I told you

lately how proud I am of you?

TED

Seriously? I'm doing all right?

UNCLE BILLY

You're taking this bull of an

empire by the horns, but you're

still keeping your small town

values. You're not letting all this

"stuff" spoil you.

TED

I owe it all to you. Without your

help I'd be lost.

UNCLE BILLY

I wish I knew you years ago, when

my brother was alive. I wish he

never gave you up.

TED

Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to

say...you can't change your

Christmas past, but you sure can

exchange your Christmas presents.

UNCLE BILLY

Why don't you come to town this

weekend? We could play some golf,

chase some skirts.

TED

I'd love to, but I really need to

crack the books.  Final exams are

coming up and I've been slacking.

UNCLE BILLY

You're right. I should work, too.

Our first issue together is almost

ready to print.

TED

Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for

everything.

UNCLE BILLY

You're a great kid. Don't you

forget it.

TED

James, what are you doing here?

JIMMY

You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl

Petersen said James sounds too

pretentious.

TED

Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine

years old, what does she know?

JIMMY

She knew exactly where you were

staying, which you neglected to

tell me, your own brother.

TED

It's really late...do your parents

know where you are?

JAMES

Mom and Dad think I'm tucked safely

in bed and that's all they need to

know. Will this discussion be

continuing in the hallway, or

somewhere slightly more inviting?

JIMMY

Impressive. This is bigger than our

whole house.

TED

Most places are, Jimmy.

JIMMY

They say money can't buy happiness

but this is a reasonably good

facsimile.

TED

So, what brings you here at his

hour?

JIMMY

My new bike.

TED

Very funny.

JIMMY

I came to ask permission to take

custody of your room.

TED

My room?

JIMMY

Better view, more spacious, new

carpet. It's a no-brainer.

TED

It's not up to me.

JIMMY

Mom and Dad said it's yours. They

seem to think you're coming home.

TED

You can have it, then. I'm not

going back there.

JIMMY

If you could just sign right there.

TED

You want it in writing?

JIMMY

Just a formality.

TED

That's it? I mean, you don't want

to order room service or anything?

We could play games and watch

movies and stuff.

JIMMY

Are you kidding? Mom and Dad

discover I'm gone and I'll be doing

hard time.

TED

Are they okay?

JIMMY

Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes

are nearly swollen shut from crying

and Dad spends all his time under

the car trying to fix stuff that

isn't broken, things couldn't be

better.

TED

I miss them, too.

JIMMY

You can't come back. That is, you

can, but your things will be in the

room you currently think of as

mine.

TED

You're a peach.

JIMMY

Funny you should say that. My

Grandfather was a peach farmer.

TED

He was my Grandfather, too.

JIMMY

I meant biologically.

TED

That's a crappy thing to say.

JIMMY

Look Ted. I'm cool with everything.

You've long been dissatisfied with

our mediocre little town. You've

always had an itch for the good

life. I'm happy for you. This

couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

But just for the record, my Mom is

a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad

is the best damn auto mechanic this

side of the Himalayas. You seem to

have forgotten they opened Nelson's

FAMILY Market so they could build

something permanent, a legacy, for

us. Their kids.

TED

I didn't forget.

JIMMY

You ever look down on them again

and call them "grocers" like it's a

dirty word, and you'll be sucking

your filet mignon through a straw

for six to eight weeks. Got it?

TED

Loud and clear.

TED (CONT'D)

That's probably my office.

JULIE

Well? Where the hell are you?

TED

He's on the move?

JULIE

I got an anonymous tip and an

address in Cincinnati.

TED

Let's do it.

TED

I don't know. This place seems

pretty tame.

JULIE

You expected whips, chains, Merk

being cattle-prodded by some

dominatrix in a leather hood?

TED

At least it's not another 4-H

meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.

JULIE

Amen to that.

TED

Look at us. It's one o'clock in the

morning, on a school night. We're

in a smoky nightclub, hoping to

catch our principal with some big

city tart.

JULIE

I'm trembling with excitement.

TED

That has more to do with your

proximity to me.

JULIE

(playing along)

My desire betrays me, like

goosebumps on my flesh.

TED

I have a bit of a goosebump fetish.

Not many people know that.

JULIE

I figured you for more of a hairy

armpit guy.

TED

Shoes, if you want to know the

truth. Shoes are my thing.

JULIE

Wearing them?  Or humping them?

TED

My fantasy is a totally naked

woman, wearing nothing but a Timex

and suede clogs.

JULIE

That's refreshingly deviant.

TED

What about you?

JULIE

I'm very aural.

TED

Tell me more.

JULIE

Sounds, voices, music, humming. All

of it can turn me on, or off, like

a switch.

TED

(feigning a deep voice)

I see.

JULIE

I had a Portuguese boyfriend who

could read the phone book and melt

me.

TED

(jealous)

A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very

"Cosmo."

JULIE

You live and learn. I realized the

most important thing to me, above

all, is trust.

TED

Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh?

I saw that one coming.

JULIE

You lose trust in someone and it's

over, done, gone, forever.

TED

Do you trust me, Julie?

JULIE

Not a chance.

TED

Come on.

JULIE

Trust is something you earn, over

time. You don't just inherit it

overnight like a gazillion dollar

empire.

TED

I want you to trust me.

JULIE

Maybe someday.

TED

Julie, I'll tell you something that

is the god's honest truth. I've

seen a lot of really beautiful

girls. I mean a lot. But none of

them make me feel like you do.

JULIE

That's hard to believe.

TED

But absolutely true.

SINGER (O.S.)

..."A feeling deep in your

soul/Says you were half, now you're

whole..."

JULIE & TED

OH. MY. GOD.

TED

We just found the ULTIMATE

centerfold for "The Girls of

Xenia!"

JULIE

I have to be honest with you, Ted.

I really despise "The Girls of

Xenia."

TED

I know, their small town mentality

can be maddening.

JULIE

I mean your pictorial. It bothers

me, profoundly.

TED

Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like

being a doctor.

JULIE

You're telling me you don't get

aroused by a roomful of naked

breasts.

TED

You've seen one naked breast,

you've seem them all.

JULIE

Which explains the continued

success of "Heaven" for how many

decades?

TED

You're quick. I like that.

JULIE

You think you're working with

chimps here?

TED

The thing is, I made a commitment.

I said I'd do it and I have to keep

my word.

JULIE

Keeping your word is something I

can actually respect, Ted.

CUT TO:

CHRISTY

I thought I'd be nervous, but you

sure know how to make a girl feel

relaxed, Teddy Bear.

TED

I do? I mean, yeah, I do.

CHRISTY

I have to admit, I am so totally

turned on. We should do it. Now.

TED

Do it?

CHRISTY

You know...take the pictures?

TED

I remember the first time you

walked into Mrs. Temple's class in

2nd grade. Blue gingham dress.

Blond ponytail.

CHRISTY

Which you pulled, hard!

TED

That was code for "I like you."

CHRISTY

Wanna unzip me?

CHRISTY (CONT'D)

Remember dress up day?  You and

Charlie lifting skirts during

recess.

TED

I miss those days, when schoolyard

sexual harassment was without

consequence.

CHRISTY

Things change. Now I'm taking off

my clothes...all by myself.

CHRISTY (CONT'D)

Well?

TED

You have changed since second

grade.

CHRISTY

I mean, what do you think?

TED

You expect me to think at a time

like this? There isn't a drop of

blood in my brain.

CHRISTY

Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.

TED

(sotto)

God help me.

CHRISTY

I heard they do this on photo

shoots.  Wanna to do the other one?

TED

You're doing just fine, Christy.

Believe me.

CHRITY

Then I'm ready when you are.

CHRISTY

I was always too shy to admit how

much I liked you.

TED

Come on, I was hamburger. You were

porterhouse.

CHRISTY

Maybe on the outside. But inside,

deep down, I've always been

dripping with special sauces.

(she smiles, sexily)

Are you hungry?

TED

God, you are so hot.

CHRISTY

Then you better get in the water,

before you get burned.

CHRISTY (CONT'D)

You and me, finally. This will be

so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.

TED

I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy

about you forever, and this is

definitely a page right out of my

palm pilot, but I just can't go

through with it.

CHRISTY

Sure you can. You're only human.

It's not like you're made of steel.

(she lowers her hand)

Or ARE you?

SMASH CUT TO:

JULIE

What's up, doc?

TED

Wait, Julie, wait!

JANITOR

I'm sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed

right past me.

TED

(calling after Julie)

At least let me explain!

JULIE

Go away, Ted. Just go.

TED

Please believe me. It was just a

kiss for old time's sake. I've had

a stupid crush on her since I was

seven, but I never got closer to

her than four feet and then there

she was right in front of me,

completely naked.

JULIE

Being naked is no big deal. It has

nothing to do with emotion, nothing

to do with love. You can be around

all the naked girls you want and

you won't be even one step closer

to anything meaningful in your

life.

JULIE (CONT'D)

See that? You don't know me even

one ounce better than you did

before. You and your stupid

magazine. I liked you better when

you were sweet and kind and human,

like the rest of us.

TED

Yes?

UNCLE BILLY (O.S.)

We've got a huge problem with the

magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers

hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.

JOCK #1

You got a great sense of humor. I

love the three hundred pound Eskimo

chick.

JOCK #2

You like Eskimo pie, Teddy?

JOCK #3

I like the African chick with the

big lip. You could stash a lot of

weed in there. Maybe even a six

pack.

CHARLIE

Holy stinkers, what were you

thinking?

TED

We wanted to challenge the notions

of classic beauty. We wanted to

showcase women throughout the

world.

CHARLIE

Next time, make sure you put a barf

bag in the centerfold.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Ted, I realize I owe you an

apology. You're destroying "Heaven"

much faster from the inside than I

ever could from the outside. Good

job, son.

HEAD OF MARKETING

Our advertisers are wigging out.

Half of them are threatening to

pull their ads for next month. The

other half already did.

UNCLE BILLY

It was nothing more than beginner's

folly. Tell everyone to lighten up.

HELEN

It's a little more serious than

that, Bill. The stockholders have

requested a meeting. They want our

guarantee that this will never

happen again.

(the words pain her)

Some of them are even calling for

Ted's resignation.

TED

Look, the girls of Xenia are

gorgeous, you'll see. Next month

we'll be back to normal.

HEAD OF FINANCE

Another disaster like this could

sink us. We've got thousands of

subscribers requesting refunds.

UNCLE BILLY

The kid came up with something that

sounded good on paper. Who knew our

readers wouldn't dig it?

HEAD OF MARKETING

We tried to warn you.

UNCLE BILLY

Sometimes young people need to make

their own mistakes. That's how they

learn.

TED

(firmly; to Uncle Billy)

It won't happen again. It will

never happen again.

TED

I always thought I wanted fame and

fortune and beautiful women. But

sometimes your dreams come true,

and they cause you nothing but

grief. I just want to chuck

everything and sell the stupid

magazine. It's not worth the pain.

HELEN

Come, let me show you something.

HELEN

Your parents never wanted to

interfere with your life, Ted. They

knew your Mom and Dad loved you

very much. They knew they did the

right thing. But that doesn't mean

they didn't watch you and miss you,

from afar.

TED

You mean they knew who I was?

HELEN

They kept this scrapbook of your

life. It meant the world to them.

TED

I wondered about them, for so many

years. I wondered if I looked like

them, acted like them. I wondered

why they gave me up.

HELEN

Giving you up was the most

unselfish thing they ever did. When

they founded "Heaven," they wished

they could take you back but it was

too late.

All they could do was build the

empire, knowing that someday it

would all be yours.

TED

My legacy.

HELEN

Your parents would be crushed to

think you weren't happy with it.

TED

They're not my parents, Helen. My

parents are back in Xenia and I

hurt them very much.

HELEN

I understand.

TED

And the girl I love, she hates

"Heaven." If I keep it, she'll

never respect me.

HELEN

But how can you respect yourself if

you don't?

TED

Everything I am is because of you.

Can you ever forgive me?

MOM

(hugging him)

Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

DAD

You were always our number one son.

JIMMY

(rolling his eyes)

Mom, Dad. This display of

unconditional love is appalling.

MOM

We are a FAMILY.

JIMMY

A family, need I remind you, that

HE ridiculed and left for dead.

TED

Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.

DAD

I will not have my boys arguing.

JIMMY

So, when I'm seventeen, can I turn

everyone's life upside-down, behave

like a total piece of canine

excrement, and then wipe the slate

clean with a half-baked apology and

a Kodak moment?

MOM & DAD

No!

JIMMY

Which is precisely why I got the

rights to my new room IN WRITING.

TED

(to his parents)

I need your help.  I'm really in

deep shit.

MOM

Don't say "shit," honey. Use the

strong vocabulary God gave you.

DAD

Besides, there's no problem too

deep or too shitty for us to solve.

DAD

Son, it's a simple fix. The only

difference between my store and

that magazine of yours is a bunch

of zeros. Now, have I ever told you

the story about the can of peaches?

UNCLE BILLY

Ladies, gentlemen. "Heaven" has

gone to hell.

UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)

I loved my brother. I stood by his

wishes to let his son run the

company. A son he never knew. A son

that he and his wife gave away at

birth. A son who was raised in a

world quite different from our own.

Nevertheless, I was there for the

lad. I guided him as best I could.

But he's only seventeen, with a

mind of his own and judgment that

is, well, frankly, not a chip off

the old block. There is only one

clear solution...

(gesturing to himself)

And I think we all know what that

is--

TED (O.S.)

--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!

UNCLE BILLY

What are you doing?

TED

My job. Back off, Benedict.

TED (CONT'D)

The only man I called "Dad" owns a

little grocery store in Xenia,

Ohio.  He learned a lot of cool

stuff from my Grandpa, who was a

peach farmer in his day. Grandpa

knew the right thing to say in

every situation, and it usually

involved peaches. My dad's a lot

like him. And he taught me, you

have to focus on the peachy side of

life, not the pits.

TED (CONT'D)

There was a time when canned

peaches were the hottest, greatest

thing ever invented.

It was like a little taste of

summer, anytime you wanted. Grocery

stores couldn't keep them in stock,

they were so popular. And even

though other canned fruits like

pears, plums, and pineapples have

come along, people still need to

know they can get their canned

peaches, on the same shelf,

whenever they want them. It's

comforting, you know? It fulfills

their expectations.

TED (CONT'D)

You're probably wondering if

there's a point to all this and I

guess it's just that I goofed last

month. I not only moved the canned

peaches, I restocked the shelves

with kiwi, guava, and mandarin

oranges in heavy syrup. I

challenged people's expectations.

And you can't do that to your

customers. So, I ask you for one

more chance to fix things and give

our readers back their canned

peaches.

TED (CONT'D)

Thanks for teaching me an important

lesson. What makes a family is

love, not blood.

UNCLE BILLY

All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.

TED

That's right. And guess who's the

new King of the Unemployment Line.

UNCLE BILLY

Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone.

I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.

JULIE (V.O.)

"It's easy to fall prey to petty

jealousy when considering the young

life of Ted Nelson. But how would

any of us behave if one day all our

dreams came true? Would we handle

it half as well? Would we find

ourselves making the same mistakes

for which we criticize him?"

TED

"One can only hope that Ted Nelson

will find bigger and better dreams

upon which to set his sights as the

years pass. And that he will

remember, always, where he came

from."

CHARLIE

Page three.

JULIE

Not bad for a hack. He has a future

in yellow journalism.

CHARLIE

He kicked major ass and you know

it.

DJ

This one's for you Dick Merkin of

Tecumseh High. From all your

students. With hugs and kisses.

BARBRA STREISAND (ON THE RADIO)

"People/People who need People/Are

the luckiest people in the world."

JIMMY

Why so melancholy?

CHARLIE

You were born naked, wet, and

hungry. Now you're hip, handsome,

and rich. You are the coxswain on

the ship of life.

JIMMY

Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary!

CHARLIE

(proudly)

I taught him that.

TED

Great.

JIMMY

From my wise, albeit youthful,

vantage point, the world is your

oyster. You scored big.

CHARLIE

You got everything you ever wanted.

TED

Except the girl. The only one that

really mattered.

JULIE (O.S.)

And who might that be?  Miss July?

Miss August?

TED

Julie, wow. I was afraid you left.

I was afraid I'd never see you

again.

JULIE

I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're

the one with the champagne wishes

and caviar dreams.

TED

I decided to let Helen run the

magazine. I need to go to college,

learn a few things, you know.

TED (CONT'D)

And I thought maybe I'd take up

boating. I've always wanted to be a

"coxswain."

JULIE

Very ambitious. I like that.

TED

The thing is, I'll need a first

mate.

JULIE

I know where you can find any

number of naked girls who'd love to

hop on board.

TED

Julie, you were right. All the

naked girls in the world mean

nothing.

It's the one you want to cover up

with your coat that you really

love.

JULIE

Planet Ted. Five years from now.

What's happening?

TED

I graduated from college. Did

great, summa cum laude and all. And

I'm about to launch a brand new

magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An

homage to Miss Julie Conroy of

Xenia, Ohio.

JULIE

I know where you can find an

excellent editor-in-chief.

TED

Yellow pages?

JULIE

Let your fingers do the walking.

TED

They're playing our song.

(extending his hand)

Dare I ask for this dance?

JULIE

(taking his hand)

You better.

CHARLIE

I'm a sucker for a happy ending.

(hugging Jimmy)

Hold me.

TED (V.O.)

So, as you can guess, everybody

pretty much lived happily ever

after. My parents didn't give up

the grocery store...

TED (V.O.)

...but they did manage to sneak

away for a second honeymoon.

TED (V.O.)

Merk's appearance in "Heaven"

turned out to be a good thing. He

was spotted by a talent scout...

TED (V.O.)

...and went on a European summer

tour, fulfilling his lifelong

dream. Naturally he brought

Poochie, the only girl he ever

really loved.

TED (V.O.)

After graduation, Charlie moved to

Utah...

TED (V.O.)

...where he married all three of

the identical Taylor Triplets.

Let's just say, they've been very

busy...

TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And even Uncle Billy landed on his

feet.

BILLY

...with a two year subscription to

"Heaven," you get a free underwater

calculator.

TED (V.O.)

And now if you'll excuse me, I

think I'll get back to being the

coxswain on the ship of life.

FADE OUT
