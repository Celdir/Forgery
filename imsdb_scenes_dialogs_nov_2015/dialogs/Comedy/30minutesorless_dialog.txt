30 MINUTES OR LESS

OVER BLACK

CUT TO:

TIRES SCREECH

15-YEAR-OLD

That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes

late. Pizza's free.

2.

WILL

Gimme a break. You guys live two

towns away. It's pretty much fucking

impossible to get here in 30 minutes.

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD

Exactly. That's why we ordered from

your shitty "trattoria."

WILL

This is gonna come out of my paycheck.

You sure you don't want to take the

moral high ground?

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD

We'd rather take the pizzas.

WILL

Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You

figured out a way to beat the system.

(PEEKS INSIDE)

Got the house to yourselves?

15-YEAR-OLD

That's right.

WILL

Not bad. Any jailbait in there?

Little pizza and a rainbow party?

WILL

Seriously? Well, two hustlers like

yourselves gotta have the place

stocked with beer and whippits and

shit, right? Just call the girls up

and let them know the party's on.

15-YEAR-OLD

Man, we don't have any of that stuff.

WILL

I really shouldn't do this...but you

seem like a couple of good dudes.

I'll tell you what, you give me the

money that your mom left you for the

pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.

(MORE)

3.

WILL (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

But I get to keep the change as a

tip. Deal?

WILL

I'll see you in like 20 minutes.

WILL

You boys like Budweiser, right?

15-YEAR-OLD

Uh, yeah, totally.

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD

Love that shit!

WILL

Yo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out.

CHRISTOPHER

You have a pretty good shift?

WILL

For sure. I mean, the part where I

had to drop off all those pizzas

kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.

4.

CHRISTOPHER

Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids

calling in saying you ripped them off.

Promised to buy them beer or something.

WILL

I actually did buy the beer, but it

would have been illegal to give it

to them, right? So I'm gonna do the

responsible thing and drink it myself.

CHRISTOPHER

That's real funny. But I'm trying

to run a business here.

WILL

What kind of business promises to

deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?

It's ridiculous.

CHRISTOPHER

I don't wanna hear another one of

your bullshit excuses. You're fired.

WILL

Come on. If I didn't need this job,

I wouldn't be doing this shitty job.

WILL

Fuck! Whatever!

CHRISTOPHER

You know, you were an okay driver

half the time. And you're not a Puerto

Rican. Which means something to me.

WILL

That's poignant.

CHRISTOPHER

I guess I could rehire you, on a

provisional basis. Of course, this

would be at the slightly reduced

"new company rate."

WILL

Are you fucking serious?

CHRISTOPHER

I don't know. Is there anyone else

left in town for you to work for?

5.

WILL

When do I start?

CHET

What the hell? Have you just been

sitting there?

WILL

Yep. Caught the whole show. Really

classy move at the end. You know,

the kiss. Putting your tongue in

her mouth right after you fucked it.

CHET

Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure

me on a weeknight, in her car no

less...I'm not gonna make her feel

like an untouchable. I'm gonna make

her feel like a lady.

WILL

What manners. May I offer you some

alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of

yourself out of your mouth.

CHET

By the way, she said she had a friend.

Maybe we can go on our first double

date since you tried to talk Jackie

Fortunato and her cousin into having

a four-way with us.

WILL

I misread their body language. It

happens.

6.

WILL

Come on. Let's go inside, drink

your beer and watch shit get crazy.

(FANS MOVIES)

Old favorites. You choose. Lethal

Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna

get the third Lethal Weapon, but

decided on a porn. So it's really

between the first two.

CHET

I choose sleep. I gotta teach a

class at eight.

WILL

You're a sub. Just call in sick.

Like the real teacher did.

CHET

Come on, man, you know I got promoted

to full-time last month. You bought

me a laser pointer.

WILL

Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just having

a hard time accepting you as "the

man." You know, flunking kids, giving

out spite detentions to girls you

wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.

CHET

I also get healthcare and my summers

off. It's not perfect, but it's a

career.

WILL

I guess that's just the difference

between you and me.

WILL

I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.

No rules, no attachments. Every

other day some asshole is trying to

take my badge. You're fucking

Murtaugh. Always worried about your

pension. Well, guess what, it gets

old after the first movie.

7.

CHET

I just got head. I'm totally Riggs.

WILL

Fuck.

WILL

You asshole. You titanic asshole.

Come on down and get your prize.

WE'RE IN

DWAYNE

Fruit motherfuckin' salad!

8.

JAY

This one's gonna blow even bigger.

DWAYNE

Boy, if you weren't such a skinny

little bitch you coulda been in the

military or something.

JAY

Whatever. I don't need the military.

I taught myself how to do this shit.

DWAYNE

I hear that. I taught myself how to

eat pussy. And cut my own hair.

DWAYNE

This one's all me.

(makes "radio" sounds)

Mr. President, we have enemies at

the gate. Give me the order.

(more "radio" sounds)

Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate

with terrorists!

DWAYNE

Wanna make sure I get enough calories.

JAY

I thought you wanted to get diesel

for the summer. Bang that towel

girl at the community pool.

9.

DWAYNE

It's obvious you don't know shit-all

about physical fitness. You gotta

bulk up first, then you slim down.

I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I

told you to watch Pumping Iron like

a month ago. If you'd listened to

me, maybe you'd know what the fuck

I'm talking about.

(BEAT)

Grab some RC Cola.

JAY

Shit, man! It's so real!

DWAYNE

Check it out. I ain't afraid of

Jason. I'm fucking him.

(THRUSTING HARDER)

You like that, Jason!? In the mask!

GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.)

Who are you two fags fucking?

JAY

Afternoon, Major.

DWAYNE

Dad, we're watching a flick. We got

45 minutes and a potential 3D sex

scene left. You're sorta coming in

at the worst possible moment.

10.

MAJOR

I bought that TV set so I could watch

my programs, not so you and your

friend could louse up my couch.

DWAYNE

You gotta learn how to share the

common space.

MAJOR

The only thing common in this house

is you. You remind me of your damn

mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way.

DWAYNE

Let's get outta here. This movie

sucks anyway.

MAJOR

I paid for the damn cold cuts, too.

Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking

prospect, or a clue how to find any

of the above, I'd let you eat 'em.

DWAYNE

(QUIETLY)

You know, you can be a real

sonofabitch, dad.

MAJOR

That's what it takes, boy. In the

Corps, men like you wore dresses to

keep us entertained.

DWAYNE

That's pretty fucking disturbing!

DWAYNE

Fuck The Major!

11.

DWAYNE

- and he thinks he knows me. He

don't know shit. I got ideas he

could never dream of. I got plans

bigger than his fucking house.

(BEAT)

He didn't even raise me. My mother

did. That was a good woman.

JUICY

Oh yeah? What happened to her?

DWAYNE

She passed on.

JUICY

I hope you're not one of those guys

that comes here looking to get

mothered.

DWAYNE

I wouldn't mind nursing on them

titties, mamacita.

JUICY

Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just

keep quiet for a while, forget about

your old man and let me do my thing.

DWAYNE

I wish I could forget about that

asshole for good. I'm just waiting

around for him to drop dead. Don't

wanna mess with my inheritance.

JUICY

What kinda inheritance?

12.

DWAYNE

When my dad got outta the service, he

started buying lotto tickets. He'd

play his dog tag numbers. In '91,

the fucker won five million bucks.

DWAYNE

He had some health problems a few

years back, and since then he's been

burning through the money like an

NBA draft pick. Probably only got a

million or two left. But it's mine

as soon as he kicks.

JUICY

You know, with a million bucks, you

could have anything. Be like a king.

(almost a moan)

King Dwayne.

DWAYNE

That's right. And maybe I'll make

you my queen. Let you polish my

royal scepter.

JUICY

Practice makes perfect.

JUICY

Let me ask you a question...do you

really hate your daddy?

DWAYNE

Hate him like the Steelers.

JUICY

Then maybe I can help you get that

money now. Before he spends another

penny.

JUICY

I know a guy in Baltimore. He could

help you out. Probably do it for...

(sizing him up)

...100Gs.

13.

DWAYNE

Do what?

JUICY

Kill your mean old dad.

JUICY

So, what do you think...you ready

for your crown?

WILL

Rio?

KATE

That's the plan. Five days, six

nights. Culture. Beaches.

Acceptable probability of kidnapping.

I leave in the morning.

KATE

This morning I loaded up an African

Safari and a cruise to Alaska.

WILL

Oh, the places you'll go.

KATE

Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making

it seem so easy.

14.

WILL

It is. Just do it. Get away for a

while.

KATE

Even if I could afford that...they

fired two other paralegals last week.

Now's not the time to be putting in

for vacation days.

WILL

Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the

actual working world. Can we eat?

KATE

How do you keep sneaking up here

past the security guard?

WILL

He's there like half the time. The

other half I smile at him. I'm

relatively certain he's a homosexual.

KATE

Interesting theory...

KATE

Maybe I should set him up with Tom

Small. He came out to me today on

Facebook.

WILL

That kid beat the hell out of me and

Chet in grammar school. Wow.

KATE

Tell me about it. He fingered me at

junior prom while they were playing

"No Scrubs."

WILL

(WINCES)

Really? What a fucking scrub.

KATE

So, I've got some news...

15.

WILL

I thought the Tom Small stuff was

enough of a headline, but go ahead.

KATE

I'm getting back together with Mark.

WILL

But you...you broke up with

him...ended the relationship.

Finality was had.

KATE

Yeah, but we were talking and -

WILL

Forget it. I don't want to know.

KATE

You sound like Chet.

WILL

Woah, don't compare me to your

brother.

KATE

Well, neither one of you seems to

care that I don't have a life. Mark's

not perfect...but a relationship is

better than working late every Friday

because I have nowhere else to be.

WILL

Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday

night. Nowhere to be.

KATE

You know what I mean.

16.

JAY

I don't wanna stick my nose into a

family matter...but killing your old

man? That's pretty messed up...I

mean, unless you think it isn't.

DWAYNE

What we have here is a classic "lesser

of two evils" debate. You got one

evil: me shaving a few years off The

Major's shitty life. Then you got

the other evil: The Major ruining my

entire awesome life by blowing through

my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased,

but mine sure as shit seems like the

lesser.

JAY

I guess I...sorta see where you're

coming from. And you have been

waiting around forever for that money.

You deserve it, Dwayne.

DWAYNE

You know, there's a reason I sleep

'til noon everyday. And it ain't

'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of

me having so many goddamn dreams.

Big ones. And once that money's

mine, they're all gonna come true.

DWAYNE

Like I had this one dream last night.

I was cruising through town in a

Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was

blowing through my hair, ruffling my

open shirt. There was a hot little

piece of ass sitting next to me. And

in the back seat, Jay...was you.

Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.

JAY

Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about

me, Dwayne.

DWAYNE

It was only this once, Jay. To be

honest, I didn't know what to make

of it. So I consulted my dream book,

and found out it means this: you're

my road dog. You got my back.

(MORE)

17.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

That's why I want to make you my

partner.

JAY

In what?

DWAYNE

In crime. And business. You see, it

ain't just about the inheritance money.

It's about what I'm gonna do with it.

DWAYNE

I'm about to clue you in on something.

And then you'll understand the true

magnitude of what's at stake here.

Are you ready?

JAY

Yes. I'm totally ready.

DWAYNE

Then answer me this...what's this

town missing? I'll give you a hint.

It's a cash business, crawling with

sexy bitches.

JAY

(BEAT)

A Chinese food restaurant?

DWAYNE

No. A tanning salon.

(BEAT)

Think about it. All that green.

All that brown flesh.

DWAYNE

It's also the perfect front for a

prostitution ring.

JAY

Yeah, of course. Because of the booths.

DWAYNE

Yes. And because of the bitches.

(BEAT)

It can all be ours. 30 percent for

you, 70 percent for me. You just

gotta help me out here.

18.

DWAYNE

I'm starting to wonder if my dream

book was wrong about you. Maybe you

sitting behind me doesn't mean you're

my road dog. Maybe it means you're

plotting to stab me in the back,

like some snake in the grass.

JAY

That's crazy. I'd never do something

like that. The dream book was right!

JAY

Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting

him or anything. I'll hold him while

you shoot him. That's it.

DWAYNE

Here's a fact: they don't build prisons

for criminals, they build them for

idiots. Shit, they got three different

types of CSI on TV, just laying out

how the police do their business...and

still, idiots like you think you can

just go out and do a murder yourself.

(BEAT)

If you wanna be a millionaire, you

gotta think like one. And

millionaires don't kill people.

They hire assassins. Which I did.

We gotta pay him on Tuesday.

JAY

What? Why would you do that?

DWAYNE

I was presented with an opportunity.

I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a

highly trained assassin is a steal.

JAY

But we don't have that kinda money.

DWAYNE

Now we're addressing the real problem:

how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause

once we get that, we get the million.

(MORE)

19.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

And once we get the million, we will

literally own this town and every

single thing in it.

JAY

I guess we could just...rob a bank.

One of these local banks with nothing

but a dipshit security guard.

DWAYNE

Again, not quite thinking like a

millionaire.

JAY

Okay, then let's hire someone to rob

a bank.

DWAYNE

Fuck hiring them, we could just force

someone to rob a bank for us. Like

with blackmail, or death threats, or -

JAY

(ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)

A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb.

DWAYNE

I was gonna say hypnotism...but I

like that. It's out of the fucking

box. We just strap one to some

motherfucker's chest, like we did to

those watermelons. Think you can

you build some kinda bomb vest?

JAY

Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it

in caves. I got a garage workshop.

DWAYNE

I'm pretty sure this is exactly how

a millionaire would do it. And the

beauty of it is: we don't lose any

sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.

JAY

Except The Major.

DWAYNE

Yeah. The Major dies. But no one

gets hurt.

20.

DWAYNE

There's just one problem. Where do

we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a

kidnapping, then we're right back

where we started...doing shit that's

gonna get us caught.

(MIND WORKING)

What we need is someone to come to

us...to a place where we can control

the situation. Someone without any

connection to us.

PIZZA CHEF

(ON TV)

We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes

or less! Or your pizza is free!

Giorgio's Trattoria, where the

customer gets what they want...pronto!

DWAYNE

Sometimes fate just takes out its cock

and slaps you in the face with it.

VOICE (O.S.)

You're not trying to draw a psycho

pension...you really are crazy!

RIGGS

(ON TV)

I'm hungry. I'm gonna get something

to eat.

CHET

Maybe you should pace yourself.

It's noon on a Saturday.

WILL

Fridge is full, man. We're all good.

21.

WILL

Let me ask you a question. You

remember Tom Small?

CHET

Yeah, he used to kick our asses.

WILL

Turns out he was probably jerking

off to it afterwards. He's gay.

CHET

I hope he chokes on a dick. I never

liked him.

WILL

Your sister did. She let him finger

blast her. Big time.

CHET

What the fuck are you talking about?

I don't want that shit in my head.

WILL

Sorry. Kate told me about it last

night. I thought you should know.

CHET

You two were swapping stories about

getting fingered? That's pretty cute.

WILL

The point I'm trying to make is this:

Tom Small was an asshole. He was

totally wrong for your sister. Just

like every other guy she's ever dated.

Right through to that Mark dude she's

gonna get back together with. Un-be-

fuck-me-lievable...

CHET

Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking

about who my sister goes out with?

22.

CHET

WILL

CHET

WILL

CHET

WILL

CHET

WILL

CHET

WILL

CHET

WILL

23.

CHET

You? An adult? Sort of stretching

the term.

WILL

Hey, let's not say shit we can't

take back.

CHET

Take back? Will, you got kicked out

of junior college for punching a

professor that made fun of some poem

you wrote.

WILL

That poem was about your sister!

CHET

That is, literally, the saddest thing

I have ever heard. Like retards

playing freeze tag sad. No wonder

you deliver pizzas for a living.

WILL

Fuck you! Maybe I was just hanging

out with you for your sister. You

were always a whiny little bitch.

And you stuttered. All the kids

used to call you "Chutter."

CHET

Whatever. I only started hanging out

with you because you had a Nintendo.

WILL

Did you see my Nintendo naked?

Because I saw your sister changing

into her swimsuit at your thirteenth

birthday pool party. And it was the

highlight of the whole shitty event.

CHET

Okay. You wanna do this?

WILL

I think we already are.

CHET

Well, you know who I saw naked?

Jenny Rifkin. While I was nailing

her. The week after she dumped you.

(MORE)

24.

CHET (CONT'D)

Why do you think every time you wanna

bet on whose cock's bigger I'm always

willing to go in? 'Cause I know

mine's bigger. 'Cause she told me!

WILL

Wow...wow. You pulled a Judas on Jenny

fucking Rifkin. That is messed up.

Almost as messed up as how I sold your

Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks.

CHET

My grandpa left me that ball in his

will! You helped me look for it for

a month!

WILL

Now you know why we never found it.

WILL

We done here?

CHET

Not quite yet. There's actually a

mystery I wanna solve for you.

(BEAT)

I was the one who told John Tanner

about how your mom fucked that

lifeguard. And I always felt awful

about it, because even though he

swore secrecy, he told everyone else

in town. And then your parents wound

up getting divorced. But now...I

don't give a shit.

WILL

What!? You ruined...my fucking life!

CHET

Krav Maga, bitch. I bet your poetry

professor didn't know this shit.

WILL

Get offa me!

CHET

You threw the first punch!

25.

WILL

I'm gonna break this hold and then

kick your skinny ass!

CHET

Try it!

WILL

What the fuck is that!?

CHET

My knuckle in your spine! No holds

barred you backstabbing fuck!

WILL

I'm gonna pass out...

CHET

Good!

WILL

(face bright red)

I love her, Chet...I love Kate...

CHET

Let me tell you something. And it's

the truest thing you'll ever hear,

from the person who knows you best

in the world...you're not good enough

for my sister. And you never will

be. You're the lowest common

denominator, Will. You're the square

root of fucking zero.

WILL

Fuck you...Chutter!

(GRABS DICK)

Square this!

CHET

Get out of my house. You're a shitty

friend.

WILL

Right back at you.

26.

CHRISTOPHER

Come on, wake up and get to work.

WILL

Where the fuck is this?

CHRISTOPHER

How should I know? It's 30 minutes

away or the pizza comes out of your

paycheck. Tick tock.

27.

WILL

Hello?

DWAYNE (O.S.)

(calling back from beyond door)

Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The

county's got us doing repairs at the

ass end of the night!

WILL

What the -

WILL

Holy fuck!

DWAYNE

Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!

DWAYNE

Fuck! Get him!

WILL

What the hell!?

(at a loss)

Rape!

28.

DWAYNE

Step one.

CUT TO:

DWAYNE

You thought we were gonna rape you.

(CHUCKLES)

Idiot.

DWAYNE

Just shut up. The tape is there for

a reason. 'Cause this next part is

gonna take a measure of calm. Are

you with me? Can you be calm?

DWAYNE

Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-

The-Fuck Street, right now you are

wearing an explosive vest.

DWAYNE

Calm the fuck down!

DWAYNE

Now stay still and my associate will

show you.

29.

JAY

Take it easy, man. You're fine. I

built this thing. It's pretty stable.

DWAYNE

For a fucking bomb. So don't trip

over your shoelaces or anything.

That thing's full of C-4. And the C

is for chaos.

JAY

Actually, the C stands for "composite."

But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into

stuff.

DWAYNE

Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?

WILL

Help!

DWAYNE

You know where you are? You might

as well be in space, motherfucker.

Nobody can hear you scream.

WILL

Why are you doing this to me? I

don't have any money.

DWAYNE

Not yet. But you're gonna go get us

some.

WILL

Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.

I'll go sell my car. I'll get you

like a thousand bucks.

DWAYNE

I want 100 thousand.

WILL

Where the fuck am I supposed to get

that much money?

DWAYNE

The Donner-Wells National Bank on

Charles Road.

30.

JAY

Across the street from the Olive

Garden.

DWAYNE

Yeah, the one across the street from

the Olive Garden.

WILL

Do you guys have an account or

something?

DWAYNE

No, I don't have an account! You're

gonna rob it!

WILL

How the fuck am I supposed to rob a

bank?

DWAYNE

Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped

to your chest. That's a start. It'll

scare the fuck outta people. Maybe

use your brain and go get a gun.

Borrow one from a friend for all I

care. It ain't rocket science.

WILL

Then do it yourself.

DWAYNE

I would, but I'm already wearing

this gorilla mask and you're already

wearing that bomb.

(TO JAY)

Tell him about the vest.

JAY

You seem like a pretty trustworthy

guy. I mean, you got a job and all.

But just in case you were gonna try

to take the vest off, we booby trapped

it to shit. There's also a remote

detonator on the back, so we can

trigger it by dialing a number.

DWAYNE

And it's on speed dial. So do what

you gotta do, but we'll be watching.

(MORE)

31.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

You go anywhere near a police station,

and Fourth of July comes early this

year.

DWAYNE

It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.

DWAYNE

Once you have the money, call this

number and you'll be given instructions

on where to drop it. You do good, we

give you the six-digit combination

that stops the timer and opens the

lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go

back to delivering pizza, the mail,

whatever the fuck you want.

(BEAT)

Now let me demonstrate what happens

if you don't get us the money.

DWAYNE

Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?

You don't have the money? It was

too tough to rob the bank, so you

just went back to your bear cave and

cried like a bitch? Well, guess

what my stuffed friend...time is up.

DWAYNE

I liked that bear. I don't even

know you.

DWAYNE

Go on. Get outta here.

WILL

Guys, can we please just talk about

this?

32.

DWAYNE

Yeah, of course we can.

DWAYNE

Be careful!

DWAYNE

That's right! Get the fuck out of

here! You're wasting time!

JAY

What the hell, Dwayne? You told me

that was a replica gun.

DWAYNE

It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50

bucks to put a firing pin in it.

Now it goes boom.

JAY

We didn't discuss a loaded gun!

Especially not with the bomb around!

DWAYNE

Don't you ever question me. I'm

fucking this bitch. You're just

holding the camera.

JAY

(VOICE FALTERS)

Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.

DWAYNE

Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines.

This is cash money. You hesitate, you

fuck up...and I will leave you behind.

DWAYNE

Let's go get some breakfast.

33.

WILL

Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me!

Someone please fucking help me!

CHET

This whole region here, about 830

thousand square miles, was part of

the initial Louisiana Purchase.

SEVENTH GRADER

(COUGHING)

Nice laser.

CHET

Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3.

CHET

What do you want?

WILL

We gotta talk.

CHET

I'm working here. Do not mess with

me at work.

34.

WILL

Chet, for the love of god, just talk

to me in private for one minute.

CHET

You wanna apologize, don't you? You

look like shit. You've probably

been up for days thinking about what

an asshole you were. Well, it's

gonna take a lot more than some

pathetic groveling -

WILL

(SUDDENLY)

Chet! Shut up! I don't wanna

apologize to you!

CHET

Then what do you want? Because we

don't have anything left to say to

each other.

WILL

Here goes. And this is gonna sound

crazy. Because it is fucking crazy.

But last night two guys in masks

jumped me and strapped a bomb to my

chest, and now I have less than eight

hours to rob a bank.

CHET

You're hysterical. Got me. Great

joke. I'm going back to work now.

CHET

What the fuck? Is that real?

35.

CHET

Stay away from me! What the fuck

are you involved in!? Terrorism!?

WILL

Chet, do you really think I'm a

terrorist?

CHET

Yes! One of the dumb ones! The

ones they convince to wear the bombs!

WILL

I am not fucking around here. Two

guys did this to me. And if I don't

rob that bank in time this thing is

gonna blow.

CHET

Seriously?

WILL

Seriously.

CHET

And your first idea was to come to a

school filled with young children?

WILL

I didn't -

CHET

Just back the fuck away from me with

that thing.

WILL

Listen, I think the vest is safe for

now. These guys don't want me to

blow myself up on accident before I

get their money.

CHET

Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths

that rigged a bomb to your chest

made sure it was safe? There's no

margin for error in their fucking

bomb vest design!?

36.

WILL

I don't know! All I do know is that

this is real. This is happening.

And I'm sure you hate me as much as

I hate you right now, but I have

nowhere else to go.

CHET

For what?

WILL

For help, Chet. I need your help.

Please. I can't do this alone.

CHET

Damn it!

(takes a breath)

I'd like to tell you to get fucked,

but you know what the problem is...I'm

a better man than you. And someday,

I might actually forgive you. So if

I let you blow up, or whatever, that

shit might come back and eat at my

conscience, and totally affect my

relationships with other people.

Like my wife and kids and shit.

WILL

That's a...very rational way to look

at the situation.

(GENUINELY)

And you're right, about being a better

guy than me.

CHET

Are you sure that thing isn't gonna

blow at any second?

CHET

Could you just walk a few feet in

front of me for a while?

WILL

I can do that.

37.

WILL

Thank you.

CHET

Yes, I'm still here. I really am

this stupid. Just pay attention to

where you're going.

WILL

I think I can handle it.

CHET

These floors get waxed once a week.

On Tuesday, which today is. You hit

a slick patch, trip and fall, and I

got a classroom full of kids wearing

their skin inside out.

WILL

Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as

it is. Please. I don't need you

back seat driving me right now.

CHET

Obviously.

WILL

Just for the record, this isn't a

nuclear weapon strapped to my chest.

And there are metal lockers on either

side of the hallway. If I fall, and

if this thing goes off, I'm probably

not taking out the whole school.

CHET

Do you really want to debate this?

38.

CHET

You're an asshole.

WILL

Whatever. It's over.

WILL

Who was the chick in the white jeans?

CHET

Kristi Evans. Why?

WILL

You know why.

CHET

Oh, come on. Just keep walking.

WILL

Come on yourself. You knew exactly

who I was talking about.

CHET

Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade.

WILL

I bet you love it when she calls you

Mr. Chet.

CHET

She doesn't call me "Mr. Chet."

She's not a foreigner.

CHET

...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll

call you after I talk to the doctor.

CHET

So, this is it?

WILL

This is what?

39.

CHET

Once I step inside this car, I'm

basically in a steel coffin with you

and...that thing. And if it goes

off, all they're gonna find in there

are two charred bodies and pieces of

a bomb. They'll assume we were driving

to a government building to blow it

up. It'll be all over the news.

Next thing you now, some militia or

Islam group is claiming us as members.

My family will be humiliated.

WILL

We'll also be dead, in that particular

situation, so it won't really matter.

CHET

Exactly!

WILL

I get it. Take your time, man.

CHET

This is the world's biggest favor,

you motherfucker. You didn't even

help me move last winter.

CHET

Given the situation, I think you

should obey all traffic safety laws.

WILL

Fine.

WILL

Okay, so where are we going?

CHET

I have no idea. I just got in your

car. I thought you had a plan.

40.

WILL

Well, I don't! I've been sorta

preoccupied with this crushing fear

of death!

CHET

No plan. I can't say I'm surprised.

WILL

Your plan is probably better. Just

condescend me until I explode.

CHET

Maybe we should turn on the radio.

See if the signal sets the bomb off.

That would be an interesting experiment.

CHET

Listen, let's just go back to my

place. Figure out our options.

Maybe you can get the vest off or

something. I just don't want to do

anything stupid.

WILL

Unless we have to.

CHET

Holy fucking shit!

WILL

Stop it! You're scaring the fuck

out of me!

CHET

Okay. Okay. Fuck!

CHET

I'm cool now.

41.

WILL

Why did you do that?

CHET

Do what?

WILL

I saw you.

CHET

It's in case I have to jump out.

WILL

If I survive the day, and you don't

because you jumped out of a moving

car and broke your neck, I'm gonna

laugh my ass off.

CHET

And if abandoning ship saves my life,

then that laugh will be mine.

CUT TO:

WILL

It's too tight!

KITCHEN

CHET

What if we try to separate your

shoulder?

42.

WILL (O.S.)

Fuck you!

CHET

Well, all these sites say different

shit. There's not a lot of consensus

in the bomb disarming community.

WILL

This is pointless.

CHET

I agree. We gotta call the cops,

have them fly in the bomb squad or

something.

WILL

We can't. These guys said they'd be

following me. And I don't have a

clue what they look like. For all I

know, they're outside right now.

They see the cops show up, they blow

the vest and cut their losses.

WILL

What do I do, man? What do I do now?

CHET

I don't know, Will...I guess you

gotta rob the bank.

WILL

I haven't been inside a bank in three

years! How the fuck am I supposed

to rob one!? They wouldn't even

give me a savings account!

CHET

It's gonna be okay.

WILL

No, it's not! I'm gonna blow up!

That's way worse than getting stabbed

or shot. At least some people survive

that. No one survives being blown

up.

(MORE)

43.

WILL (CONT'D)

No one is ever like, "Yeah, I heard

Steve got blown up, tough break, but

how's he doing now? Is he still in

the Rec basketball league?" No of

course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing

left of Steve except a stain on the

wall and a pair of fucking high tops!

CHET

Pull yourself together!

WILL

Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my

eardrum.

CHET

Sorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do

that. But just listen to me now.

You're not gonna die. You wanna

know why? Because you know exactly

how to rob a bank.

WILL

What are you talking about?

CHET

Point Break.

WILL

The movie?

CHET

Yes. That movie is like a how-to

guide for bank robberies. You just

bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast.

Stick to the tellers and don't bother

with the vault.

WILL

Yeah...I guess it's pretty simple,

right? And it's just a local bank.

The Donner-Wells on Charles Road.

CHET

Really? I applied for a job there

like a year ago.

44.

WILL

You wanted to be a teller?

CHET

Yeah, so what? It's a good job.

You get benefits.

WILL

Like what, a name tag?

CHET

What kind of benefits do you get?

Free toppings?

WILL

That's really clever. No one ever

said that shit to me before. Anyway,

this is perfect. You know the whole

layout of the bank.

CHET

Not exactly. They didn't hand me

the security schematics with the

application. But I sat in the waiting

area for like 20 minutes. I know

what the place looks like.

WILL

How many guards?

CHET

One. I think.

WILL

That's a start.

CHET

It's a great start. You can do it.

WILL

You're gonna do it with me, right?

CHET

I was actually gonna stick to giving

tips, ideas...motivational speeches.

More of a consultant or advisory role.

WILL

Jesus Christ, Chet. Please. I'm

begging you here. I need you on

this. If I do it alone, I'm dead.

45.

CHET

Are you gonna cry again?

WILL

That was a moment of weakness.

(BEAT)

Yes. I'll fucking cry again if that's

what it takes.

CHET

I should make you blow me.

WILL

Sure. Whip that shit out. I'm

actually kinda curious. I wanna see

if Jenny Rifkin lied to you. She

obviously lied to me.

WILL

All these guys want is 100 grand.

We can do this.

CHET

We're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand?

Just leave the rest of the money

sitting there? Why?

WILL

I don't know. I guess they're very

modest criminals. Who the fuck cares?

Wait...you said "we" right?

CHET

I'm putting my life on the line for

100 grand...what does 100 grand even

buy these days?

CUT TO:

46.

JUICY

I missed you so much, baby.

VAUGHN

You don't got enough dicks to keep

you warm in that place?

JUICY

You know it's not like that. Those

guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol.

VAUGHN

Well, Marisol...what I want is to

get my money, kill that old ass man,

then get the fuck out of here.

JUICY

Then that's how it's gonna go. We're

just waiting on a call.

VAUGHN

This is my impatient face.

JUICY

Well, I think I can keep you

entertained.

WILL

Should we go with the handguns...or

the Uzis?

CHET

Handguns.

WILL

That's such a Murtaugh choice.

CUT TO:

47.

REGISTER WOMAN

You sure you don't want to grab some

condoms?

WILL

Uh, no. Why?

REGISTER WOMAN

Because this is usually what men buy

before they rape someone, and I want

to make sure you all use protection.

WILL

Lady, we're just...buying some stuff.

REGISTER WOMAN

Is that cash or credit for your rape

kit?

CHET

We'll pay cash.

DWAYNE

You really fucked up this mix tape.

DWAYNE

We're not speed freaks knocking off

a 7-Eleven. We're masterminding a

heist here.

JAY

Sorry, Dwayne. That song just means

a lot to me.

DWAYNE

I wish he would hurry his shit up.

48.

JAY

You worried about that other guy

he's with?

DWAYNE

No, man. He picked him up at a

school. So long as there ain't any

cops, he can take the whole town

with him. I just want my money.

JAY

What? You want me to run over to

Subway, get us a couple sandwiches?

DWAYNE

If you had any vision, Jay, you'd

know exactly what I'm thinking about

right now. And it's not a sandwich.

(BEAT)

Look how well trafficked that shopping

mall is. It's the perfect place for

the tanning salon.

JAY

Oh, you're totally right.

DWAYNE

I've been thinking about it, and I

want you to start off working the

counter. Sounds like a demotion, I

know, but it's an important position.

Because we're gonna be using code

words and shit. For example, if a

customer walks in and says he wants a

tan, that just means he wants a tan.

But if he says he wants a "deluxe

tan," that means a blow job and you

gotta get one of the girls in there

to suck him off. You with me?

JAY

So far. But what if he wants a fuck?

DWAYNE

There's gonna be codes for everything:

missionary, anal, black chicks. I

got it all written down back home in

my files.

(MORE)

49.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

I'm not gonna bother getting into it

with you right now, because you're

supposed to be on lookout and you're

no good at multitasking.

JAY

Okay. 'Cause they're about to get

away.

DWAYNE

Fuck.

WILL

Be careful, you're getting paint

everywhere.

CHET

Are you really worried about your

upholstery right now?

WILL

Yes, because if I survive this shit

I'm quitting my job. That means

I'll probably have to give up my

place and I'll be sleeping in the

back of my car, which you're covering

in toxic paint.

WILL

That side isn't dry yet. You're

about to ruin it.

CHET

It says it's fast drying.

WILL

Fast isn't the same as instant. You

gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.

CHET

How would you know? You do a lot of

graffiti?

50.

WILL

No, but I spray painted my bike last

year after I got my license suspended.

I didn't let it dry properly and I

fucked it up.

CHET

We don't have time to sit around and

literally watch paint dry. Aren't

we going straight to the bank?

WILL

I was actually thinking we need to

stop and steal a car first.

CHET

What? No way! We've got a car.

WILL

Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it

as a getaway vehicle. They can trace

the plates. Even if we do get away,

we'll be arrested.

CHET

Well, I can't hotwire a fucking

automobile, and neither can you.

WILL

That's why I was thinking we'd steal

one from your parents' friends. The

Fishers. Remember how they used to

pay us to clean their garage? They

leave the keys in there. And they

have a Datsun. That's a fast car.

CHET

I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.

Let's steal a car from your parents'

friends.

WILL

What friends? My parents don't have

any. My dad moved away after your

big mouth ruined his marriage and

humiliated him, and no one wanted to

hang out with the mom who everyone

knew fucked a lifeguard.

51.

CHET

You never should have told me! I

was 13 years old. I couldn't process

that kind of information. I had to

tell someone else.

(shakes his head)

Fuck. I really am sorry about it.

Okay? Despite what I said before.

I was just a kid, but I messed up.

WILL

Okay.

CHET

That's it? You're not gonna apologize

for selling my Cal Ripken ball?

WILL

Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my

family was going through a rough patch

and I was smoking a ton of weed and

listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the

time. And that I needed some extra

dough to indulge my habit. Which, in

hindsight, was probably just a cry

for help. But you never even noticed.

CHET

Thanks. Now I feel even worse.

WILL

I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I

knew it was wrong and I regretted it

like the next day. I actually tried

to buy it back but the guy wanted

twice as much. I had to smoke even

more weed just to get past the whole

shitty incident. I guess that's why

they call it a downward spiral.

CHET

I appreciate that you tried to buy

it back. So, thanks.

CHET

We should probably get going.

52.

CHET

Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn

day to be over!

CUT TO:

WILL

The keys aren't here. They always

used to leave the keys out.

CHET

Yeah. When we were teenagers. This

is fucked.

WILL

Let's just find them.

CHET

Sorry.

CHET

You hear that?

WILL

What?

53.

CHET

Mr. Fisher is coming!

CHET

Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there?

WILL

No!

CHET

What are you doing?

WILL

I'm doing what I have to.

MR. FISHER

Oh, Jesus!

WILL

Where are the car keys?

MR. FISHER

They're in my pocket! I'm just

reaching in my pocket for the keys!

WILL

Quiet down and do it already.

WILL

Now listen, I don't want you to report

this car stolen or anything until

later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock.

6 to be safe.

54.

MR. FISHER

Sure. Anything you say.

WILL

If you fuck with us, I swear, I

will...I will shoot your son. Taylor.

I know where he works. At the fucking

travel agency. He's the douchebag

with the bangs.

MR. FISHER

(STUNNED)

Please no. I won't do anything. I

won't. Just leave Taylor alone.

WILL

I'm gonna trust you. But if you

call the police, there's gonna be an

undertaker styling his stupid fucking

bangs!

(BEAT)

Now open the garage door.

WILL

The car's insured, right?

WILL

Okay. I feel better. Worse comes

to worst, something happens to it,

you can get a Honda. This thing

doesn't even have airbags.

MR. FISHER

Please, just go.

55.

CHET

That old man's got a heart condition!

You could have killed him!

WILL

My hand was forced!

CHET

Awesome. I'm stuck inside an even

smaller car with you and a bomb.

WILL

This thing's got some pickup.

CHET

Could you just take it easy, we're

doing fine on time.

WILL

I know...but there's one last stop

we have to make.

CHET

Do you have to take a piss first?

Because I do.

WILL

I need to see your sister.

CHET

Are you for real? Did you really

just ask me that? You salt-in-an-

open-wound motherfucker!

WILL

Chet, as if it isn't apparent, I may

die today. I'll probably die today.

And if there's one small thing that's

clear to me now, it's that I've wasted

two and a half decades as a pussy,

watching everything I want pass me

by. I don't wanna peace out of this

world as a pussy. I need to tell

her how I feel.

CHET

You're really gonna turn this into

some sort of dying wish bullshit?

56.

WILL

Yes, I really am. It means that much

to me. I am not fucking around here.

CHET

I don't think you are. I mean,

apparently, you love my sister so

much that you're willing to put her

life in danger by going to see her

with a bomb strapped to your chest.

WILL

She won't be in danger. I promise.

I got it all worked out. And you

can even take a piss while I'm inside.

DWAYNE

Where the fuck is he going? What's in

there? Some sort of FBI headquarters?

I told that guy not to fuck around!

DWAYNE

Maybe I should give that bomb a call.

JAY

No! Let me just go see what he's up to.

DWAYNE

I was just fucking around. Are you

gay for this guy or something?

JAY

I just wanna get the money, Dwayne.

Same as you.

DWAYNE

All right. Then man up and go check

it out.

57.

DWAYNE

Don't even tell me you're about to

do a reconnaissance without a cover.

What's you cover?

JAY

I don't know...I'm from the telephone

company?

DWAYNE

Yeah, nice fucking uniform.

DWAYNE

You're a personal shopper. You're

delivering the latest fashions to Mr.

Quilby in marketing. Got it?

DWAYNE

"He's got the whole world in his

hands. He's got whole fucking world

in his hands..."

WILL

...no, I'm here right now.

KATE (O.S.)

(OVER PHONE)

Why are you acting so strange?

WILL

Because strange shit is going on.

I'll explain everything. Just meet

me where I texted you.

KATE (O.S.)

WILL -

WILL

Please. Just do it.

58.

KATE

(CALLING OUT)

Will?

WILL

Stop!

KATE

What are you doing?

WILL

Just don't come any closer.

KATE

Why not? What's going on?

WILL

I'm gonna give you the short version

of an incredibly complicated and fucked

up situation, so please be cool.

(BEAT)

Some very bad guys strapped a bomb

to my chest and they are forcing me

to commit a crime.

KATE

Will, I swear, if this is -

WILL

I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I

know it's a lot to swallow, but you

gotta take it on face value, because

there's a timer attached to this

thing and it's counting down.

KATE

Oh my god, Will...we'll get help.

I'll get you help.

59.

WILL

I didn't come here for help. I'm

taking care of it. I came here

because, should things not work out

today as I would like them to, I

want you to know why I was doing the

things I did.

KATE

Please, just let me call someone.

Let me do something. This is crazy!

WILL

I don't disagree with you. It's

fucking nuts. But that's not even

what this is about.

(STRUGGLING)

Do you remember when you found that

picture in my car of you, me and

Chet, with Chet cut out of it?

KATE

Will, I can't remember about some

stupid picture while you're -

WILL

I need you to remember about the

picture, and about how I stop by

your office every Friday, and how

I've always hated all your boyfriends,

and how the two girls I've ever

seriously dated have looked like

less attractive versions of you.

(BEAT)

Do you see where I'm going with this?

I love you Kate. I have for a very

long time.

KATE

Will, this is a lot you're putting

on me! You just told me people are

trying to kill you or something, and

now you say you love me. What the

fuck is going on?

WILL

A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do

this to you, but I was afraid I'd never

get the chance to tell you. And I

know you have feelings for me, too.

Maybe you feel for me the way you feel

for a good friend, or - if the world

fucking hates me - a brother.

(MORE)

60.

WILL (CONT'D)

But what I hope is that you don't really

know how you feel for me, and that

maybe when you figure it out you'll

realize it's the same way I feel for

you. Does that make any sense?

KATE

Yes. I mean, I've known you forever.

It's not an easy thing to figure out.

WILL

I don't need an answer now. Just

think about it. And no matter what

you decide, you're too good for

assholes like Mark and the rest of

them.

KATE

Okay. I will process all of this.

It's just, the bomb -

WILL

It's distracting. I know. Anyway,

I'd love to stay and talk some more,

but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave

now, because I'm running out of time.

KATE

If I had time to think about it...I'd

probably tell you that I've always

felt very strongly for you. And I've

never thought of you as a brother.

WILL

That's a huge relief. Don't say

anything else. I just really don't

want to die now.

KATE

Try not to. Please.

61.

JAY

I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper.

I'm looking for Mr. Quilby.

KATE

I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.

DWAYNE

So?

JAY

It was just his girlfriend or something.

DWAYNE

Getting one last blow job in case he

don't make it. I kinda like this guy.

CHET

Did you tell her how you saw her naked

when she was 13? That always works.

WILL

I said my piece. She's gonna think

about it.

CHET

Shut up. She was freaked out.

WILL

Yes. By the bomb.

CHET

By you.

62.

WILL

Would it be so bad if we ended up

together? You and I would be family.

CHET

I don't want you in the family. You

bring very little to the table. I

want her to be with someone awesome.

A pro quarterback. A war hero. At

the very least, someone I've never

watched porn with.

WILL

Well, now it's up to her.

CHET

Not if I set that bomb off myself.

WILL

Then you'd probably never get to rob

a bank.

CUT TO:

WILL

You go for the money. I'll cover

the crowd. In and out.

CHET

I'm not feeling so good. I drank

like three of those 5-Hour Energy

drinks.

WILL

It's just nerves. Let's pull our

shit together and do this thing.

63.

CHET

What should I call you in there,

like if I need to ask you to do

something?

WILL

Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius.

CHET

I can tell you're not a black guy

through the ski mask.

WILL

Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm

Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers

and that's the way we gotta roll

when we get in there.

WILL

Everybody put your hands in the air!

CHET

No, get on the ground!

WILL

Actually, listen to him and get on

the fucking ground!

WILL

Shut up! Please!

WILL

You, just stand right there and don't

do shit! The rest of you get the

fuck down! Spread your arms and legs!

Why is no one listening to me!?

SECURITY GUARD

Just take it easy, man!

64.

WILL

Don't be a hero, cowboy!

SECURITY GUARD

What the fuck does that mean? I'm

not a hero! Or a cowboy!

ANOTHER -

CHET

All of you, back away from the counter

and get out here! Anyone pushes a

button and one of these people gets

totally shot!

WILL

Very slowly, take out your gun and

toss it away.

MOM

Oh, god! I don't want the gun!

WILL

(TO GUARD)

What the fuck!? Did you do that on

purpose!?

SECURITY GUARD

It was an accident!

CHET

Are you guys working together?

MOM

No! Please take this gun away!

WILL

Just toss it, lady!

65.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Ah!

FAT MAN

I think she got the femoral artery!

MOM

I'm sorry! It was an accident!

FAT MAN

Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!?

DAUGHTER

Mommy, what's happening!?

MOM

Christi, be quiet. These men are

dangerous.

CHET

This is fucked. That dude is gonna

bleed out and we're gonna go to prison.

WILL

Just calm down.

FAT MAN

Why is no one getting me help!?

WILL

Is anyone here a doctor?

WILL

Sir, let me see where you're hit.

FAT MAN

Just call me an ambulance!

WILL

Calm down, sir.

66.

WILL

It's just a flesh wound. You're

gonna be okay.

FAT MAN

But it hurts so bad.

WILL

You got shot, man. It's not supposed

to feel good. But you're gonna be

fine. And you'll have a great story

to tell everyone.

FAT MAN

This is an awful story! This isn't a

bank error in my favor! I got shot!

WILL

Point taken. Luis, how we doing on

the money?

CHET

Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz.

CHET

Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably

scared right now, but if you go grab

us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out

of here. This will all be over and

you'll be fine. You trust me?

FAT MAN

My leg really hurts!

WILL

Can you please hurry up, Sandra!?

67.

WILL

I'm really sorry, everyone. I know

we probably fucked up your day.

(looks to Fat Man)

I'm thinking of you in particular,

sir. Actually, you know what...

WILL

Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me.

Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm

coming for you. I remember faces.

CHET

What the fuck was that about, Sandra?

I thought we had something going!

What happened to trust?

SANDRA

I'm sorry! They make us do it!

WILL

Could you kindly fill another bag?

Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage

bag. And Luis, will you watch her

this time?

CHET

Okay. That should be enough.

WILL

Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped

the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!?

SANDRA

No! It was Mark! He pushed the

button when you guys came in!

68.

MARK

Sandra, you bitch! Now they're gonna

kill us both!

SANDRA

Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager!

WILL

Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you!

I'm a regular guy! Just like you!

I'm a regular guy and you fucked me!

Thank you for fucking a regular guy!

CHET

Let's just get the fuck out of here.

OFFICER ZURMAN

Drop your weapons!

CHET

Don't shoot us!

OFFICER ZURMAN

Drop the guns or I'll have to!

WILL

Fuck you! You just brought a gun to

a bomb fight, officer! I pull these

wires out and we all go! You got

ten seconds to drop your gun and -

69.

CHET

That was awesome.

WILL

He was tempting a desperate

motherfucker.

DWAYNE

Holy shit! Our boy is causing some

serious mayhem!

JAY

He's gonna get caught or killed.

DWAYNE

Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this

with your negativity, I'm gonna strap

a bomb to your chest next.

JAY

Oh, yeah, who's gonna build it?

DWAYNE

You are!

CHET

Shit! This is not cool!

70.

CHET

Maybe we should pull over and

surrender.

WILL

I can outrun these guys. They're

not the FBI, they're local cops.

Just shut up and let me concentrate.

I do this for a living.

CHET

You don't do anything like this for a

living! I am not a pizza, I am a man!

WILL

Holy fuck!

CHET

Go! Go! Go!

CHET

Stop! Stop! Stop!

71.

WILL

That guy got fucked up.

BLACK

WILL

Chet? Are you okay? Chet!?

CHET

(ROUSING)

Oh my god...

WILL

Talk to me.

CHET

I thought you were gonna blow up.

72.

WILL

No. Luckily your side took most of

the impact.

CHET

Awesome.

WILL

We gotta keep moving.

WILL

Oh, fuck, man. Come on.

CORNER INTO

WILL

Chet...I don't know how to tell you

this...but you got a piece of the

car in you.

CHET

What!?

WILL

In your back.

CHET

Ah! Get it out!

WILL

I will.

CHET

Do it now!

73.

WILL

All right.

CHET

Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus?

CHET

Why are you moving so slowly?

WILL

It's a combination of cheap sneakers

and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest!

WILL

Hey! Over here!

DWAYNE

You hear what happened to the guys

they were after?

74.

RANDOM LOCAL

Sounds like they got away.

WILL

I never thought I'd see you again.

CHET

I thought you hated this car.

WILL

It's actually not that bad. You know,

as compared to that Datsun. The

Mustang's got more comfortable seats.

And it never would have flipped over.

WILL

There's a 100 grand in there. 100

fucking grand. Which we stole.

From a bank.

CHET

I told a bunch of people I was gonna

shoot someone. I was like "you

fucking move, and I will kill you

where you stand!"

WILL

I threatened to blow up a cop.

(BEAT)

And you never said "I will kill you

where you stand."

CHET

I know. But shit did get pretty crazy.

WILL

Yeah, it did.

75.

WILL

You know, there's no one I would

have rather taken down a fucking

bank with. I mean that.

CHET

Me, neither.

WILL

And as for all that shit I said...and

all that shit I did...I hope you can

forgive me. We've been friends for

so long, and I guess you hurt the

people you're closest to the most.

CHET

I messed up, too. I'm a dude who

slept with his best friend's ex-

girlfriend, and destroyed his parents'

marriage, and sat on the sidelines

watching his downward spiral. I'm a

shitty human being. But I'm glad

you know that now, because you can

accept me for who I am.

WILL

I do. I accept you. Because you

accept me.

CHET

Woah! You still got a bomb on you.

WILL

You're right. Let's take care of

that. But you owe me a hug.

WILL

It's all gravy from here.

INTERCUT WITH:

76.

DWAYNE

This who I think it is?

WILL (O.S.)

Can't you hear the ticking in the

background?

DWAYNE

You know, you're a pretty funny guy.

WILL (O.S.)

Thanks. I'm happy to entertain a

complete psychopath.

DWAYNE

Now wait a second, you're the murderer.

WILL (O.S.)

What's that supposed to mean?

DWAYNE

One of those cops who wrecked his

car chasing you...he ain't breathing

no more.

WILL

We killed a cop.

CHET

You were driving! I'm just an

accomplice!

WILL

They're gonna hunt us down and kill

us. Cops don't take this shit lightly.

CHET

I bet he had like eight kids. We

have to find them and support his

family forever.

WILL (O.S.)

What's so fucking funny!?

DWAYNE

I'm just messin' with you. You didn't

kill anyone. How'd a moron like you

manage to rob a bank?

WILL (O.S.)

Jesus! Can we just get this over

with? Where do you want the money?

77.

DWAYNE

There's a boarded up gas station out

on Commerce Avenue, past the highway.

Be there in 30 minutes.

WILL (O.S.)

I'll be there in ten.

DWAYNE

Then you'll be standing around with

your dick in one hand, and my money

in the other.

DWAYNE

Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's

on its way.

CUT TO:

DWAYNE

I remember the summer after my mother

passed was the first year they had

the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I

musta come here three times a day

trying to collect all the game pieces.

Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from

all the grease. The Major said I was

the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he

ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,

I just wanted to win the money and

get the fuck out of there. So, one

night, I followed this skinny register

kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling

on him, asking him where they were

hiding the Park Place piece. The

million dollar prize. But he didn't

know shit. A year later, The Major

won the lotto. I asked him for a

Sega Genesis. He bought me one of

those paddles with the ball attached.

78.

DWAYNE

I'm not ashamed to admit that I've

gone through some dark times since

then. Depression. Addiction to a

variety of shit, which I won't go

into. I know you must think that's

pretty silly, especially since you

manage to get through the day and you

don't got shit going on as compared

to me. But that's just the way it

is. That's life.

JAY

You know, I've been pretty low, too...

if you ever want to talk about that

kinda stuff.

DWAYNE

No. I don't. My whole point I was

trying to make before you interrupted

me was that that shit is all in the

past. 'Cause I did it. I finally

pulled it off.

JAY

We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two

us. We're a good team.

DWAYNE

Are we? Would you do anything to

protect me, my money, my empire?

JAY

Yeah, sure...

(NERVOUS)

I mean, like what kinda stuff are we

talking about?

DWAYNE

Would you push the button?

JAY

Why would you want me to do that?

DWAYNE

It's just a question, Jay. Would

you? If I asked you?

(MORE)

79.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

I mean, it's no different than those

watermelons.

JAY

Watermelons aren't alive.

DWAYNE

Yeah, they are. Not the ones you

blew up, though.

JAY

No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne?

DWAYNE

Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.

DWAYNE

Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop

yet. I'm gonna go take a shit.

Stay away from the bathroom. Someone

could get hurt.

WILL

Where are the other guys?

VAUGHN

I'm the only guy.

(BEAT)

You got it?

VAUGHN

What the fuck did you do...rob a

bank?

80.

WILL

(INCREDULOUS)

Yes.

WILL

Now where's the code?

VAUGHN

I don't have any code.

WILL

Listen, man, I just want the code.

VAUGHN

I don't know what the fuck you're

talking about.

WILL

The code for the fucking bomb!

VAUGHN

What kind of stupid motherfucker

wears a bomb to a drop?

WILL

Your boss put this on me.

VAUGHN

I am my boss.

WILL

Then give me the code!

VAUGHN

Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn

code. Whoever told you I did, lied

to you. Now step the fuck off, or

I'll shoot you in the face so you

don't explode and mess up my boots.

WILL

If you don't have the code, I want

that money back.

81.

VAUGHN

The only way you're getting this

money back is if you kill me.

WILL

You don't know what I've gone through

for that money!

VAUGHN

Do I look sympathetic? Now step the

fuck aside.

JUICY

Vaughn, look out!

WILL

Let's go!

82.

WILL

What the fuck was that?

CHET

They tried to screw us. You're a

liability. They were just gonna let

you blow up.

WILL

Not with the money they won't.

DWAYNE

Never comes out this nice when I do

it myself. You might wanna take some

more off the top, though. I wanna

look real professional when I go down

to the morgue to identify the body.

DWAYNE

You drop the money yet?

INTERCUT WITH:

WILL

No! I've still got the money! And

I cracked your friend's face open!

DWAYNE (O.S.)

Why the fuck would you do that!?

WILL

You lied! You said I'd get the code!

DWAYNE

I gave him the code. He told me he

committed it to memory.

(MORE)

83.

DWAYNE (CONT'D)

He was probably just embarrassed that

he forgot it. I'll call him up and -

WILL (O.S.)

You didn't give him shit! I want

the code now or you'll never see

this money!

DWAYNE

Hold on there, big man. You got a

bomb on you. I got a cell phone that

detonates it. You're not exactly

negotiating from a position of leverage.

WILL (O.S.)

I'm holding the money. I blow up,

and it blows up. Who has the leverage

now? Go ahead and push the button,

you idiot.

CHET

Don't tell him to push the button!

Pull over! Pull over!

DWAYNE

Why don't you watch what the fuck

you say! I own you! I tell you to

rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I

tell you to give me the money, and

you give me the goddamn money and

hope I show you some mercy.

WILL (O.S.)

I'm tired of this bullshit. I'm

already dead, right? So fuck you.

At least I'll die rich. I can't say

the same for you.

DWAYNE

That piece of shit hung up on me!

CHET

Get me out of this car!

84.

CHET

That was colossally stupid!

WILL

It was a negotiation tactic. He'll

call back and I won't answer. Then

he'll call back and I will answer, and

he'll realize the only way he gets the

money is if he gives me the code.

CHET

Sure! That seems like a perfectly

logical pattern of thought! I bet

that's exactly what he'll do!

DWAYNE

Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?

JAY

Dwayne...you never told me you weren't

going to give him the code.

DWAYNE

We're not amateurs. He was a loose

end. I let him live, someday I woulda

been walking out of my mansion and...

bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on

my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned

state's evidence and they got what

they need to put me away.

DWAYNE

Fuck it, Jay. I'll just kill The

Major myself.

85.

JAY

Don't do it.

DWAYNE

You know what they say about a tree

falling in the forest? Maybe the

same thing applies to blowing up

some motherfucker across town. Maybe

it doesn't even make a sound.

DWAYNE

Boom.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Hello...who is this...hello...?

DWAYNE

Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause

she sounded cute for a bomb.

JAY

(SWALLOWS HARD)

Gina Kim. My seventh grade crush. Or

whoever lives in Gina Kim's house now.

DWAYNE

Where's the number for the bomb?

JAY

In my head. I switched it out of

your phone while you were taking a

shit. You're out of control, Dwayne.

DWAYNE

I'm in perfect control!

JAY

Stop it!

86.

DWAYNE

You asshole...I make you my partner

and you pull this shit...

JAY

I'm tired of you pushing me around

all the time! What kinda partner

does that!?

DWAYNE

Fuck you...I'm gonna piss blood,

aren't I?

JAY

That's what it said on the internet.

DWAYNE

Go on. Get it out for me. I can

barely move.

DWAYNE

Glad you came to your senses.

INTERCUT WITH:

VAUGHN

Who the fuck do you think you're

talking to!?

DWAYNE (O.S.)

I honestly don't know.

VAUGHN

Let me give you a hint: your boy

just jumped me, tossed my bitch like

a rag doll and split with the cash.

DWAYNE

That guy's not my boy. He's a dick.

I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion.

87.

VAUGHN (O.S.)

Confusion? The only motherfucker

that's confused is you. Apparently,

you think you can fuck me and survive

the day.

DWAYNE

I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking

him. You gotta understand, you're

like a pawn in a much larger game

I'm playing here.

VAUGHN (O.S.)

Did you just call me a pawn, you

stupid fuck!?

DWAYNE

I didn't mean it like that. I'm

just juggling a whole lot of shit.

VAUGHN (O.S.)

I want my money. Right now.

DWAYNE

That may not be possible.

(DELICATELY)

I just want to put this out there,

to keep you in the loop...but I may

need to bump the hit.

VAUGHN

This isn't a reservation at Sizzler!

You don't "bump" it! I want you to

bring me my money right now, to where

I am standing in this shit hole town,

bleeding from the motherfucking face!

DWAYNE (O.S.)

I don't exactly have the money...give

me some time and -

VAUGHN

The deal's off! You just became the

hit!

JUICY

He lives with his daddy. You already

got the address.

88.

DWAYNE

That's it. The assassin's gonna

kill me now. I'm gonna die. Game

fucking over.

JAY

We can still get him the money. Try

the pizza guy back.

DWAYNE

Why? So he can fuck around again,

and I wind up dead, anyway? No.

I'd rather just sit here. I want to

die right here on this couch.

JAY

No. We're gonna get that money.

Just like we planned. All we gotta

do is get the leverage back.

DWAYNE

How do we do that? Pizza boy's

obviously got some kinda death wish.

JAY

We take the girl. The one he went

to see. Then he won't try shit.

DWAYNE

That's actually...that's a great

fucking idea, Jay. It's the best

idea anyone's had all day.

JAY

I was just trying to figure out how

you would do it, Dwayne.

89.

DWAYNE

Ok. Then let's do it right. We

leave nothing to chance. Because if

we go to prison for this, I won't be

able to watch out for you.

JAY

Ok, Dwayne.

DWAYNE

You should probably bring the

flamethrower, buddy. There's gonna

be some evidence to dispose of.

CHET

It's been half an hour.

WILL

He'll call.

CHET

In another 30 minutes I'm calling

the bomb squad.

CHET

These guys obviously aren't watching

you anymore.

WILL

You know, even if they get the bomb

squad here in time, and they can

somehow get this thing off me, we

still gotta answer for the robbery.

CHET

I'll take the heat with you, Will.

WILL

Nah. I'll tell them I forced you

into it. That you didn't have a

choice.

CHET

Thanks, man.

90.

WILL

That's it? You're not gonna think

about it a little longer? After all

we went through...tear down the

relationship, rebuild it...you're

gonna let me go to prison alone?

CHET

You offered.

WILL

It was a test. Your grade: F minus.

You know what the "F" is for?

CHET

To fuck myself?

WILL

You passed that test. Failed the

important one.

CUT TO:

DWAYNE (O.S.)

Why don't you just slide the phone

under the door, so I don't have to

kick it open and see you with your

panties down.

91.

DWAYNE

What's the quietest way out of the

building? 'Cause I might get excited

in a confrontation, and you might

wind up shot in the face.

MAJOR

Dwayne?

VAUGHN (O.S.)

Just stay where you are, old man.

VAUGHN

I'm looking for your son.

MAJOR

Even if I knew where he was, I

wouldn't tell you nothing.

VAUGHN

Don't be stupid.

MAJOR

You know, I saved a black man's life

in the shit. So if I took yours I'd

be even.

VAUGHN

I see where your son gets his common

sense.

(MORE)

92.

VAUGHN (CONT'D)

But you might want to readjust your

attitude, because I ain't fucking

around. I want Dwayne. I don't know

why you'd want to protect him, the

motherfucker hired me to kill you.

VAUGHN

Just tell me where he is!

MAJOR

You think I'm scared of death?

There's a whole generation of gooks

that think I'm the grim reaper.

MAJOR

I'll ride you all the way to hell!

I know exactly how to get there!

VAUGHN

What now, old man!? You can't kill

me! None of y'all can kill me!

MAJOR

Go on and -

93.

VAUGHN

Motherfucker has lost his mind...

CHET

Look at the upshot, while you're

behind bars you can finally finish

your degree. If I was there, too,

it would just be a distraction.

WILL

Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot.

I'll just sit here and figure out a

fucking major.

WILL

Hey, it's them.

94.

WILL

You ready to talk now?

INTERCUT WITH:

DWAYNE

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah, I'm ready to talk. I want my

money. Meet me back at the radio

tower in 50 minutes.

WILL (O.S.)

I've barely got an hour left!

DWAYNE

That's the point. I want you on a

short leash.

WILL (O.S.)

Fuck that. Give me the code first.

Then you can have your money. You'll

just have to trust me when I say

that I don't want it.

DWAYNE

Yeah, I'm sure. You just wanna go

back to your fantastic life. Your

great job. And that blonde bitch

with the sexy voice.

QUESTION -

WILL

What the fuck is that supposed to

mean?

DWAYNE (O.S.)

It means that girl you paid a visit

to today is sitting in the back of

my van right now. And it ain't

exactly consensual.

WILL

Fuck you! You crossed a line!

95.

DWAYNE

There are no lines! There's just me

and you and 100 thousand dollars.

Once we get that shit in order, you

can have her back, and your life,

too. So you're gonna show up where

I say, when I say. Alone. And if

you try anything stupid, the two of

you will be delivering pizzas to

Saint Peter.

WILL

Let me talk to her.

DWAYNE

You got ten seconds.

KATE

Will...?

WILL (O.S.)

Kate, I'm so sorry.

KATE

It's okay...I'm fine...I'm just really -

DWAYNE

She's just really gonna die if you

fuck this up.

WILL

Fuck!

CHET

What happened?

WILL

They have Kate.

CHET

What the fuck does that mean!?

WILL

They took her, man. They must have

followed us to her office.

96.

CHET

Damn it! You had to go see her!

WILL

I'm sorry. I messed up...I finally

messed up worse than I could have

possibly imagined.

CHET

We gotta get her back, Will. These

guys are crazy.

WILL

We still got the money. As long as

we have that, she's alive. Come on.

CUT TO:

BELONG TO

WILL

I'm here!

DWAYNE

How much time you got left?

97.

WILL

Ten minutes.

DWAYNE

Damn. Maybe we should just wait

around for the money shot.

DWAYNE

That the money?

WILL

Maybe. Where's the girl?

DWAYNE

In the van. Maybe.

WILL

Get her out here. You're wasting time.

KATE

Will, are you there?

WILL

I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

DWAYNE

This is a fucking tearjerker.

WILL

Just let her come over here.

DWAYNE

I will. But you should know, my

associate over there is packing a

flamethrower.

98.

JAY

(FLAT)

Just do what we say. Don't mess

around or anything.

DWAYNE

Unless either of you can outrun a 25-

foot flame.

(gestures to gun in his belt)

Or a bullet.

WILL

Get back.

DWAYNE

I gave you the girl. Now give me

the money.

WILL

How about we get the code out of the

way first, since this bomb happens

to be ticking so close to all of us.

DWAYNE

Fair enough.

DWAYNE

(TAUNTING)

You ready to be a free man?

WILL

Just give it to me!

DWAYNE

448921.

DWAYNE

It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?

JAY

Yeah. It's awesome.

99.

DWAYNE

Okay, you can get out of here now.

WILL

I actually have this sneaking

suspicion that once we turn around,

you're gonna put a bullet in both of

our backs - and this is just a guess -

burn our bodies.

DWAYNE

They say great minds think alike.

And in this case, so do we.

WILL

I figured as much. That's why I got

a gun pointed at you, too.

(LOUDLY)

I got a sniper in the bushes locked

on you right now.

DWAYNE

Do I look that dumb?

WILL

I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.

JAY

Hey...on your forehead.

DWAYNE

Son of a bitch. Well played.

WILL

We're gonna walk out of here now.

If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I

can't guarantee he'll get both of

you. But he'll definitely get you.

100.

VAUGHN (O.S.)

Hold the fuck up.

VAUGHN

Wasn't expecting to see you here.

DWAYNE

It's all good. We got your money.

VAUGHN

Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the

money over here.

DWAYNE

Hold up. You don't have to do this.

I just paid you.

VAUGHN

I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a

pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking

day...all because of you and this job.

DWAYNE

I don't know what you're talking about.

Just take the money.

VAUGHN

I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the

two loose ends in the gorilla masks.

DWAYNE

I'm not a loose end!

VAUGHN

You're a fucking idiot. You are as

loose as ends get.

101.

VAUGHN

What the -

WHICH -

KATE

Chet!? What are you doing here!?

CHET

Not now. We gotta take off.

(LOOKS AROUND)

Where's Will?

WILL

I got the money. Let's get the fuck

out of here.

102.

DWAYNE

No!!

JAY

Dwayne! Help!

DWAYNE

Goddamn it, Jay!

DWAYNE

Stop, drop and roll!

JAY

You came back for me...you said you

never would.

DWAYNE

You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.

You did good.

DWAYNE

I'm gonna go put a bullet in that

motherfucker and get our money.

Think you can get outta here?

JAY

Yeah. Go get him.

KATE

Uh...I just got kidnapped.

CHET

Yeah, that was totally Will's fault.

In case you want to factor that in

while you're mulling over the whole

relationship thing.

WILL

I'm very sorry about the kidnapping.

This is me, taking responsibility

for it. Growing up. Like a viable

life partner.

CHET

This man has spied on you in the

nude before!

WILL

What? No, I didn't.

CHET

He's lying. He's trying to build a

relationship on a foundation of lies.

And it won't stand.

KATE

I just got kidnapped! Can we talk

about that!?

104.

WILL

Oh, shit. One of those dudes is

definitely not dead!

CHET

Hurry up! He's already on us!

DWAYNE

I own this town.

KATE

What the hell was that?

WILL

That was the bomb I carried around

all day. I reactivated it and put

it in the back of his van. I guess

his time was up.

CHET

"His time was up?" Were you thinking

that up the whole day?

WILL

I was prepared, yes. I can't help

it if I'm the kind of guy who thinks

about the future.

105.

CHET

(TO KATE)

He's not that kind of guy. He doesn't

think about the future. Ever.

KATE

What exactly happened since I saw

you this afternoon?

WILL

Primarily, we robbed a bank.

KATE

What!? So you're, like, fugitives?

What do we do now?

CHET

Yeah, Will. What does the future

hold?

WILL

Nothing good if we stay in town and

they pin this on us. Kate, I think

you should put in for that vacation

time. Right now. If anyone gives

you a problem, tell them to fuck

off. There's 100 grand in that trash

bag by your feet. A third of it's

yours.

KATE

Will, that's -

CHET

Fucked up. Why does she get a share?

WILL

Why do you get a share?

WILL

Airport's 30 minutes away. Pick a

destination. This time it's not a

practice run.

CUT TO:

106.

DWAYNE

Dad?

DWAYNE

Dad, are you -

MAJOR

Dwayne...

DWAYNE

What happened to you?

MAJOR

Some guy...said you hired him to

kill me.

DWAYNE

Dad, I...I'd never...

107.

MAJOR

Look at you...lip quivering like

you're getting fucked...be a man.

DWAYNE

I am a man! I killed you, didn't I?

Now I'm gonna use your money to open

a tanning salon where they let you

fuck the chicks.

MAJOR

You mean...like those whorehouses...in

'Nam...I used to tell you about?

DWAYNE

Those were great bedtime stories.

MAJOR

Medics are late...probably a couple

lazy spicks...you tell 'em I said

so...all right, son?

DWAYNE

Sure thing, pop.

MAJOR

Hell of thing...I think I

may...actually respect you now.

DWAYNE

Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier!

FADE OUT:

108.

CHET

Fucking nine dollars to use the

internet.

WILL

And?

CHET

Police think it was that black guy.

They found some kind of map in his

car. And I'm sure racial profiling

played a part.

WILL

But nothing about us?

CHET

Nope. Guess it's time to head back.

WILL

I was thinking we'd stick around a

little a longer.

CHET

Why? So you have more time to delude

my sister?

WILL

Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave

us five fucking minutes alone.

CHET

You really think she's into you?

WILL

(SWALLOWS HARD)

I kissed her last night. No tongue.

Then you walked in.

109.

CHET

You're gonna go fuck my sister now,

aren't you?

WILL

I'll be thinking of you the whole

time.

CHET

At the very least...be a considerate

lover. Give pleasure, before taking

pleasure.

WILL

I think I'm reading you. And I will

try my best.

WILL

You're Riggs! You always have been!

WILL

I lied and told your brother I kissed

you. I thought it would make this

easier.

KATE

Here's an idea: pretend you have a

bomb strapped to your chest. Tick,

TICK -

KATE

Is Chet watching us?

WILL

Probably. We should go inside. I

promised him I'd satisfy you.
