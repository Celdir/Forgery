The Man Who Wasn't There

"THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"

BY

Ethan Coen & Joel Coen

ED (V.O.)

Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But

I never considered myself a barber...

ED (V.O.)

...I stumbled into it--well, married

into it more precisely...

ED (V.O.)

...I wasn't my establishment. Like

the fella says, I only work here...

ED (V.O.)

...The dump was 200 feet square,

with five chairs, or stations as we

call 'em, even though there were

only two of us working...

ED (V.O.)

...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,

was the principal barber. And man,

could he talk...

ED (V.O.)

...Now maybe if you're eleven or

twelve years old, Frank's got an

interesting point of view, but

sometimes it got on my nerves. Not

that I'd complain, mind you. Like I

said, he was the principal barber.

Frank's father August--they called

him Guzzi--had worked the heads up

in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years

until his ticker stopped in the middle

of a Junior Flat Top. He left the

shop to Frankie free and clear. And

that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's

ambitions: cutting the hair and

chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk

much...

ED (V.O.)

...I just cut the hair...

FRANK

Says here that the Russians exploded

n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing

we can do about it.

ED

Uh-huh.

FRANK

How d'ya like them apples?

FRANK

...Ed?

ED

Huh?

FRANK

Russians exploded an A-bomb.

ED

Yeah.

FRANK

(shaking his head)

Jesus...

ED (V.O.)

Now, being a barber is a lot like

being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's

not much to it once you've learned

the basic moves. For the kids there's

the Butch, or the Heinie...

ED (V.O.)

...the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew,

the Vanguard, the Junior Contour

and, occasionally, the Executive

Contour. Adults get variations on

the same, along with the Duck Butt,

the Timberline...

ED (V.O.)

...and something we call the Alpine

Rope Toss.

ED (V.O.)

...I lived in a little bungalow on

Napa Street. The place was OK, I

guess; it had an electric ice box,

gas hearth, and a garbage grinder

build into the sink. You might say I

had it made.

ED (V.O.)

...Oh yeah. There was one other

thing...

ED (V.O.)

...Doris kept the books at

Nirdlinger's, a small department

store on Main Street. Unlike me,

Doris liked the work, accounting;

she liked knowing where everything

stood. And she got a ten per cent

employee discount on whatever she

wanted--nylon stockings...

ED (V.O.)

...make-up, and perfume...

ED (V.O.)

...She wore a lot of perfume.

ED (V.O.)

...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster,

was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the

department store heiress. Tonight

they were coming over for dinner--as

Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...

ED (V.O.)

...Me, I don't like entertaining.

DAVE

How ya doin', Ed?

ED

OK. Take your coat, Ann?

DAVE

Japs had us pinned down in Buna for

something like six weeks. Well, I

gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it

tough, but, Jesus, we had supply.

*They* were eating grubs, nuts,

thistles. When we finally up and

bust off the beach we found Arnie

Bragg, kid missing on recon; the

Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if

you'll pardon the, uh... And this

was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin'

to write home about. I mean, I never

would've, ya know, so what do I say,

honey? When I don't like dinner,

what do I say?

DAVE

...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--

*again*?!

DAVE

...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!

DAVE

...Were you in the service, Ed?

ED

No, Dave, I wasn't.

DORIS

Ed was 4F on account of his fallen

arches.

DAVE

Mm, that's tough.

ED (V.O.)

...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all

that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had

the feeling that she and Big Dave

were a lot closer than they let on...

ED (V.O.)

...The signs were all there plain

enough--not that I was gonna prance

about it, mind you. It's a free

country.

DAVE

Holding down the porch area?

DAVE

...That's quite a wife you got there.

ED

Mm.

DAVE

She's a rare one.

ED

How's business, Dave?

DAVE

Couldn't be better. These're boom

times in retailing. We're opening

another store, Big Dave's Annex,

there on Garson. This is strictly

haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas,

ladies' foundations and undergarments.

Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making

Doris the comptroller. How're things

at the, uh, the barbershop?

ED

All right, I guess.

DAVE

...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want

to drop by the Annex when we open,

update your suit--'course, you're in

the smock all day.

DAVE

...Say, where do you get those things

anyway?

ED

Specialty store down in Sacramento.

DAVE

Uh-huh.

ED (V.O.)

Doris and I went to church once a

week...

ED (V.O.)

...Usually Tuesday night...

CALLER

I... seven...

CALLER

...Bee... Four...

ED (V.O.)

Doris wasn't big on divine worship...

ED (V.O.)

...and I doubt if she believed in

life everlasting; she'd most likely

tell you that our reward is on this

earth and bingo is probably the extent

of it...

DORIS

Watch your card, honey.

CALLER

I... sixteen...

ED (V.O.)

I wasn't crazy about the game, but,

I don't know, it made her happy, and

I found the setting peaceful.

CALLER

Gee... nine...

DORIS

Jesus, bingo--BINGO!

FRANK

...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I

mean, if you're really serious. You

tie your own flies, you do a--I know

it's matickless, I know, people say,

hey, you can buy flies at the store--

but you can buy your fish at the

store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?

ED

Uh-huh.

FRANK

The point is there's a certain art

to the process. The point is not

merely to provide, and let me point

out, these fish are not as dumb as

you might think.

ED

Uh-huh.

FRANK

Sportsmanship! That's my point. June

fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these?

Well, what fish do you seek?

ED

Yeah.

FRANK

Sure, go to the store. Go there,

describe to the man where you will

be fishing, and for what, and the

weather conditions, sun, no sun,

whatnot, and so forth, and then you

might as well have the man go ahead

and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...

FRANK

...My point is, this is a man who

knows nothing no matter how much you

tell him, so sell him the goddamn

FISH, Ed.

MAN

OK, boys, which of you gets the

privilege?

FRANK

We're just closing, friend.

MAN

Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing

well enough to turn away business!

More power to ya, brother! The public

be damned!

FRANK

Hey, what's your problem, friend?

This is a business establishment

with posted hours--

ED

I'll take care of him, go ahead,

Frank. Have a seat, mister.

FRANK

...You sure, Eddie?

ED

Yeah, yeah--go home.

FRANK

In your ear, mister.

STRANGER

Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say!

Not so fast there, brother--

STRANGER

...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the

experts. 100 percent human hair,

handcrafted by Jacques of San

Francisco, and I'd hate to have to

tell you what I paid for it.

ED

Uh-huh.

STRANGER

Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for

it down on the installment plan...

STRANGER

...A lot of folks live with the pate

exposed. They say the dames think

it's sexy. But for my money it's

just not good grooming--and grooming,

my friend, is probably the most

important thing in business--after

personality, of course...

STRANGER

...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to

know ya.

ED

Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa

Rosa?

CREIGHTON

A goose, friend. I was chasing a

wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard

of venture capital?

ED

Uh--

CREIGHTON

Well, it's the wildest goose there

is. Risk money. Very speculative.

Except, Ed, in certain situations,

it's not, see? I thought I had a

prospect here. Well, I make the haul

up and this lousy so-and-so tells me

his situation has changed--all his

capital's gonna be tied up in

expansion plans of his own. Thank

you, mother! Pop goes another bubble!

It's only the biggest business

opportunity since Henry Ford and I

can't seem to interest a soul!

ED

That right.

CREIGHTON

It's called dry cleaning. You heard

me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--

wash without water, no suds, no

tumble, no stress on the clothes.

It's all done with chemicals, friend,

and your garments end up crisp and

fresh. And here's the capper: no

shrinkage.

ED

Huh.

CREIGHTON

That's right! Dry cleaning--remember

the name. It's going to revolutionize

the laundry industry, and those that

get in early are gonna bear the fruit

away. All I need is $10,000 to open

my first store, then I use its cash

flow to finance another, and so on--

leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole

chain. Well, me and a partner.

Cleanliness, friend. There's money

in it. There's a future. There's

room to grow... Say, that's looking

pretty good. Let's see it with the

hairpiece on...

ED (V.O.)

Dry cleaning...

ED (V.O.)

...Was I crazy to be thinking about

it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity,

the real McCoy?

ED (V.O.)

...My first instinct was, no, no,

the whole idea was nuts. But maybe

that was the instinct that kept me

locked up in the barbershop, nose

against the exit, afraid to try

turning the knob. What if I could

get the money?

DORIS

Honey?

ED

Mm.

DORIS

Shave my legs, will ya?

ED (V.O.)

...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.

DORIS

(absently, as she

reads)

Gimme a drag.

DORIS

...Love ya, honey.

VOICE

Yeah, come in.

CREIGHTON

(into the phone)

OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

CREIGHTON

...Oh, I thought you were the

porter... Can I help you?

ED

...I'm, uh, Ed.

ED

...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

CREIGHTON

Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at

a disadvantage.

ED

I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

CREIGHTON

Jesus! The barber! I'll be a

sonofagun. Why didn't you say so?

'Course--the barber.

CREIGHTON

...I didn't recognize you without

the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave

something at the shop?

ED

No. I might be interested in that,

uh, business proposition--

CREIGHTON

You got the dough?!

ED

I can get it, yeah.

CREIGHTON

Come in, come in, siddown over there.

Coffee?

ED

No. I--tell me--

CREIGHTON

Sure.

ED

What's involved, aside from putting

up the money? What're you looking

for the partner to do?

CREIGHTON

Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want

to keep tabs on your investment, of

course, but I'm looking for a silent

partner. I've done the research,

I've contacted the vendors, the deal

is set. I'm just looking for venture

capital, friend. Disappear if you

want, check in whenever you like--I

want the dough; I don't take

attendance.

ED

And how do we share--

CREIGHTON

Fifty-fifty, straight down the line.

You and me. Finance and expertise.

So--you've got the dough then, do

ya?

ED

I'll have it in a week.

CREIGHTON

Well, I'll be damned. The barber!

And I thought this trip was a bust.

Well...

CREIGHTON

...it just goes to show, when one

door slams shut, another one opens.

Here's to ya, uh...

ED

Ed.

ED

...Was that a pass?

CREIGHTON

(hoarsely)

Maybe.

ED

You're out of line, mister.

CREIGHTON

No problem!

ED

Way out of line.

CREIGHTON

Right! Strictly business.

ED

Yeah.

ED (V.O.)

I sent it to Dave the next morning.

And I waited.

ED

Frank.

FRANK

Huh?

ED

This hair.

FRANK

Yeah.

ED

...You ever wonder about it?

FRANK

Whuddya mean?

ED

I don't know... How it keeps on

coming. It just keeps growing.

FRANK

Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

ED

No, I mean it's growing, it's part

of us. And we cut it off. And throw

it away.

FRANK

Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare

the kid.

ED

OK, bud, you're through.

ED

...I'm gonna take his hair and throw

it out in the dirt.

FRANK

What the--

ED

I'm gonna mingle it with common house

dirt.

FRANK

What the hell are you talking about?

ED

I don't know. Skip it.

DORIS

Ed?

DORIS

...Gimme a zip.

ED

Where you going?

DORIS

Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I

told you last week, for the Christmas

Push.

ED

Yeah, right.

DORIS

Come on, get ready. It's important.

ED

Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

DORIS

Oh, don't be a grump.

YOUNG MAN

Wild, man!

VOICE

You in ladies' wear?

ED

...Huh?

YOUNG MAN

Haven't I seen you up in ladies'

wear?

ED

I don't work here. My wife does.

YOUNG MAN

Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

ED

Yeah.

YOUNG MAN

Check out the rack on that broad in

the angora.

ED

Uh-huh.

DAVE

Ed. Can I talk to you?

DAVE

Siddown. Siddown...

DAVE

...Souveniered it off a Jap in New

Guinea.

DAVE

...I guess you're wondering what

Doris was so hot about.

DAVE

...These're Havanas. Romeo and

Juliets. Private stock.

DAVE

...Ed, I...

ED

What is it, Dave?

DAVE

Ed, I've been weak...

DAVE

...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.

DAVE

...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been

carrying on with a married woman.

Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--

what is it they say?--the--the--the

chickens are coming home to roost.

ED

Uh-huh.

DAVE

Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But,

uh, that's not the worst of it. I

got a note. A blackmail note. You

know, come across or everybody knows.

ED

Uh-huh.

DAVE

Well, you know what that would do to

me.

ED

I guess it would be pretty awkward.

DAVE

Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my

keister! Hell, it's her family's

store--*her* store. I serve at the

indulgence of the goddamn ownership,

Ed.

ED

Uh-huh.

DAVE

I only work here! And the lady's

husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

ED

How much to they want, Dave?

DAVE

$10,000! I don't know what to do,

Ed. I don't know what I *can* do.

Even though I know who the sonofabitch

is.

ED

...You know... who *who* is?

DAVE

The sonofabitch. The blackmailer.

It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's

a businessman from Sacramento. A

goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope

me into some crackpot scheme; I heard

him out and then told him to go to

hell. And the very next day, the

very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed

for the same amount.

ED

Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

DAVE

Well, I guess he don't care that

it's obvious.

ED

Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

DAVE

He's staying at the hotel I've gone

to with, uh, with the lady in

question. Must've seen us.

DAVE

...Thanks...

DAVE

...Oh, Jesus.

ED

...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

DAVE

That's my capitalization on the Annex!

*My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty.

That's what I was just talking to

Doris about, a way of getting the

money from the store that we could

hide from Ann.

ED

Mm.

DAVE

Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn

wife!

DAVE

...Doris, she was pretty hot about

that. God bless her. She doesn't

know I'm telling you this--she's mad

enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're

the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm

sorry I... I better get back to the

party.

DAVE

...I look all right?

ED (V.O.)

In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I

knew the ten grand was going to pinch

him where it hurt...

ED (V.O.)

...But Doris was two-timing me and I

guess, somewhere, that pinched a

little too.

ED

That was pretty.

ED

...Did you make that up?

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig

van Beethoven.

ED

That was quite something.

YOUNG WOMAN

He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

ED

That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

YOUNG WOMAN

I know who you are, Mr Crane.

YOUNG WOMAN

...My father used to take me with

him when he got his hair cut. Walter

Abundas?

YOUNG WOMAN

...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls

me Birdy.

ED

Sorry, I just didn't remember.

BIRDY

Oh, that's all right. You can't be

expected to remember every skinny

girl who comes in with her dad.

ED

...You don't like the music out there?

BIRDY

It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really.

I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

VOICE

Ed.

DORIS

...What a knucklehead.

ED

Who?

DORIS

Dave.

ED

How's that?

DORIS

Ahh...

DORIS

...Money problems. He's thinking

about canceling the Annex.

ED

So?

DORIS

*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

ED

Mm.

DORIS

...What a knucklehead.

ED (V.O.)

Big Dave did it, though...

ED (V.O.)

...I sent a note telling him where

to drop the money...

ED (V.O.)

...and he did. He came across.

CREIGHTON

Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...

CREIGHTON

...You bring a check?

ED

Cash.

CREIGHTON

Cash?!

CREIGHTON

...Usually we do this kind of thing

with a bank draft. But cash--that's

fine--it's all the same in the end--

dough's dough, huh?

ED

Sure.

CREIGHTON

I got the paperwork here. Partnership

papers here, they reflect our

agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I

supply professional services, you

supply the capital. I'll give you a

receipt on the dough there, huh?

ED

Yeah.

CREIGHTON

Pretty straightforward, but I don't

know if you wanna show this stuff to

a lawyer--

ED

It's OK.

CREIGHTON

Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to

tangle it up and then you pay 'em to

untangle it, what's the point?

CREIGHTON

...Just a second here, I'll give you

a receipt on the, uh... Whoa,

Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't

talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm

gonna call the place Tolliver's,

after me, you know, I didn't think

you were much interested in, uh--

ED

That'll be fine.

CREIGHTON

Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...

CREIGHTON

...Yeah, that's it. As per our

discussion.

ED

Uh-huh.

CREIGHTON

Well, there it is. Writ large in

legal escriture, next step is--

ED

Look, uh... Creighton...

ED

...You're not gonna screw me on this?

CREIGHTON

*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a

lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry*

cleaning, this is not some fly-by-

night thing here! I must say, I've

been an entrepreneur for thirteen

years and I've never--

ED

All right.

CREIGHTON

And I've never been asked--Look, you

want the dough back? You know who I

am! You--

ED

OK.

CREIGHTON

So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?

ED (V.O.)

The next day was Saturday. We were

going to a reception for Doris' cousin

Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner

out near Modesto. Doris didn't much

feel like going, and I didn't either,

but, like she said, we had a

Commitment.

DORIS

...I hate wops.

DORIS

...What's so damn strange about that?

ED

I didn't say a word.

DORIS

...*You* didn't have to grow up with

'em.

DORIS

...Family. Boy.

CHILD

He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's

ridin' Garibaldi!

ED (V.O.)

That was when she started drinking.

WOMAN

How you doin', Doris, you been OK?

DORIS

How're you, Constanza?

WOMAN

Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And

how you been, uh...

ED

Ed.

WOMAN

Ed. How's a business?

ED

OK.

WOMAN

(to Doris)

He's a barber, right? It's a good

trade. So how come you got no kids?

VOICES

Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for

Frankie!

FRANK

No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!

VOICES

No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!

OLD MAN

Ready...

OLD MAN

...Go!

DORIS

'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn

wonderful.

ED

Congratulations, Gina.

DORIS

Life is so goddamn wonderful, you

almost won't believe it.

ED

Honey...

DORIS

It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries,

I'm sure.

ED

Honey...

DORIS

Congratulations on your goddamn

cherries!

DORIS

...Leggo my goddamn elbow.

FRANK

I never wanna see another blueberry

pie...

FRANK

...I never even wanna hear those

words.

FRANK

...Don't says those words, Ed.

ED (V.O.)

I'd met Doris blind on a double-date

with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who

was seeing a friend of hers from

work. We went to a movie; Doris had

a flask; we killed it. She could put

it away. At the end of the night she

said she liked it I didn't talk much.

A couple weeks later she suggested--

ED

Yeah.

VOICE

Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to

you.

ED

What--now?

DAVE

Please, Ed.

ED

But it's...

DAVE

Please, Ed.

ED

Your place?

DAVE

I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself

in.

ED

OK.

ED

...Honey.

ED

...Honey.

ED

...Dave?

DAVE

Come on in.

ED

...What's the problem, Big Dave?

DAVE

...I'm ruined.

DAVE

...It ruined me. This money. No annex.

I'm all shot to hell.

ED

So you paid the guy?

DAVE

...What kind of man *are* you?

ED

...Huh?

DAVE

What kind of man *are* you?

ED

Big Dave--

DAVE

I'd understand if you'd walked in

here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever.

I deserved it.

ED

I, uh...

DAVE

I'm not proud of what I did. But

*you*.

DAVE

...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know.

And then I went and found the pansy.

DAVE

...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah,

well, you already know the story. I

didn't, I hadda beat it out of the

pansy. *Your* money.

DAVE

...What kind of man *are* you?

DAVE

...Well.

DAVE

...I'm all shot to hell.

DAVE

...What kind of man *are* you?

ED (V.O.)

...It was only a couple of weeks

after we met that Doris suggested

getting married. I said, Don't you

wanna get to know me more? She said,

Why, does it get better? She looked

at me like I was a dope, which I've

never really minded from her. And

she had a point, I guess. We knew

each other as well then as now...

ED (V.O.)

...Anyway, well enough.

FRANK

Holy-moly, do I got a headache.

FRANK

...How you today, Ed?

ED

OK.

FRANK

You don't got a headache?

ED

...Nah.

FRANK

Damn, I got a headache to beat the

band.

FRANK

Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it?

That'll just flood it.

CUSTOMER

Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold

it down. *That'll* flood it.

FRANK

You crazy? You pumped it?

CUSTOMER

Well, ya can't hold it down.

MAN 1

Ed Crane?

ED

Right.

MAN 1

Come on outside.

ED

Sure.

MAN 2

...So you're a barber, huh?

ED

That's right.

MAN 1

I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.

ED

...We goin'?

KREBS

Huh? No.

PERSKY

...Cigarette?

PERSKY

Right. Uh... Pete's got some news

for you.

KREBS

...Look, pal, it's a tough break,

but, uh... well damnit, your wife's

been pinched.

PERSKY

They sent us to tell ya.

ED

Huh?

KREBS

They sent us to tell ya. We pulled

the detail.

ED

My *wife*?

PERSKY

Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county

jail, uh...

KREBS

Homicide.

PERSKY

Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A

guy named David Brewster. He's, uh...

He's the decedent.

ED

I don't understand.

KREBS

He's the dead guy.

PERSKY

...Yeah, it's a tough break.

KREBS

Visiting ends at five. Too late today.

You can see her tomorrow.

PERSKY

Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.

PERSKY

...Crap detail.

MAN

'Lo, Ed.

ED

Hello, Walter.

WALTER

Have a seat.

ED

Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at

home.

WALTER

Oh, hell. Drink?

ED

No thanks.

WALTER

Sure you don't need one?

ED

I'm fine.

WALTER

OK. Boy. Jesus!

ED

Yeah. What do I, uh...

WALTER

Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of

my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh,

probate, real estate, title search,

uh... I'd be absolutely worthless,

something like this. Absolutely

worthless.

WALTER

'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um.

Frankly, Doris'd be better off with

the county defender.

ED

He a good man?

WALTER

Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I

won't kid you though, Ed, nobody

around here has any experience with

this kind of, er... And I hear they're

bringing a prosecutor up from

Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking

it seriously... Hmm...

ED

So--

WALTER

Taking it seriously.

ED

So, who should I--

VOICE

You want any coffee, Dad?

VOICE

Oh, hello, Mr Crane.

ED

Hello, Rachel.

BIRDY

I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

ED

Yeah. Thanks.

WALTER

Coffee, Ed?

ED

I'm fine. Thanks.

WALTER

No thanks, honey.

BIRDY

OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.

WALTER

Damnit! She's a good kid.

ED

...So, uh, who should I--

WALTER

Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San

Francisco. Probity--you know, no one

ever said anything iffy about Lloyd

Garroway. Conservative. Jury might

like that. Might like that here.

WALTER

...Probity.

ED

Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for,

uh...

WALTER

Well, the best, the money-is-no-object

best, for a criminal case, any lawyer

would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider.

Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't

know how you're fixed for money.

ED

Uh-huh. He's the, uh...

WALTER

Yeah, the best.

WALTER

...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I

could tell you more. Hell, I wish I

could handle it myself. But I'd be

absolutely worthless for this kind

of thing.

WALTER

...Criminal matter? Freddy

Riedenschneider.

WALTER

...No question about it.

ED

Honey... I brought your make-up.

DORIS

Honey.

ED

How are you?

DORIS

I don't know what's going on. I--

ED

What happened to you?

DORIS

...I don't know what happened to Big

Dave. I know some of it.

Irregularities in my books, they

said. Can I explain it.

ED

You don't have to--

DORIS

I helped him cook the books, Ed. I

did do that.

ED

You don't have to tell them anything.

We're getting you a lawyer.

DORIS

I know all about that. But I don't

know how much to tell them.

ED

Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting

you Freddy Riedenschneider.

DORIS

Should I... should I tell you why?

ED

You don't have to tell me anything.

DORIS

Jesus Christ.

DORIS

...My books used to be perfect. Anyone

could open them up, make sense of

the whole goddamn store.

ED

Honey...

DORIS

I knew we'd pay for it.

FRANK

This is what family is for, Ed! This

is when ya come together!

ED

Yeah.

FRANK

Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons

of bitches!

ED

Frank, uh, you know I'll try to

contribute, but, uh--Freddy

Riedenschneider--

FRANK

I don't care what it costs! This is

when ya come together!

ED

That's very generous.

FRANK

The hell with it, Eddie!

FRANK

They're just people like you and me,

Ed. Remember that.

ED

Uh-huh.

FRANK

Just people. They gotta put up the

big front so that people will trust

them with their money. This is why

the big lobby, Ed. But they put their

pants on one leg at a time. Just

like you and me.

ED

Uh-huh.

FRANK

They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite

of appearances. And their money will

be secured by the barbershop. A rock.

A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean,

how long has *this* place been here?

MAN

Mr Raffo?

FRANK

Yes, sir.

MAN

Could you come with me please?

FRANK

Sure. Can Ed come too?

MAN

Mr...?

ED

Crane. Ed Crane.

MAN

You also have an interest in the

securing property?

FRANK

He's a barber.

MAN

Ah.

FRANK

Second chair.

MAN

Not an owner.

FRANK

No, he's family, he's my brother-in-

law.

MAN

Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited

here.

ED (V.O.)

The barbershop. Doris and Frank's

father had worked thirty years to

own it free and clear. Now it got

signed over to the bank, and the

bank signed some money over to Frank,

and Frank signed the money over...

ED (V.O.)

...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who

got into town two days later...

ED (V.O.)

...and told me to meet him at

DaVinci's for lunch.

MAN

...not fried, poached. Three of 'em

for two minutes. A strip steak medium

rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato

juice, and plenty of hot coffee.

MAN

...Do you have prairie oysters?

WAITRESS

No, sir.

MAN

Then bring me a fruit cocktail while

I wait.

MAN

...You're Ed Crane?

ED

Yeah--

MAN

Barber, right? I'm Freddy

Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell

me the chow's OK here. I made some

inquiries.

ED

No thanks, I--

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Look, I don't wanna waste your time

so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?

*You* don't mind. So while I'm in

town I'll be staying at the Hotel

Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah,

it's goofy, the suites're named after

operas; room's OK though, I poked

around. I'm having 'em hold it for

me on account of I'll be back and

forth. In addition to my retainer,

you're paying hotel, living expenses,

secretarial, private eye if we need

to make inquiries, headshrinker should

we go that way. We'll talk about

appeals if, as and when. For right

now, has she confessed?

ED

No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Good! That helps. Not that she didn't

do it, that she didn't confess. Of

course, there's ways to deal with a

confession, but that's good!--one

less thing to think about. Now.

Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow.

You should be there. Three o'clock.

One more thing: you keep your mouth

shut. I get the lay of the land, I

tell *you* what to say. No talking

out of school. What's out of school?

Everything's out of school. I do the

talking; you keep your trap shut.

I'm an attorney, you're a barber;

you don't know anything. Understood?

ED

...OK.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Good! Any questions give me a ring--

Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a

message. You sure you don't want

anything? No?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's

OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...And the flapjacks, honey.

ED (V.O.)

All going about their business. It

seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger

one even then what had really happened

to Big Dave, something none of them

knew...

ED (V.O.)

...Like I had made it to the outside,

somehow, and they were all still

struggling, way down below.

ED

Ann.

ANN

Hello, Ed.

ED

Ann. Will you come in?

ANN

...No, No, it's very late.

ED

...I'm so sorry about your loss.

ANN

Yes. Thank you.

ED

Of course, you know, Doris had nothing

to do with it. Nothing at all.

ANN

Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came

to tell you...

ED

Yes, Ann?

ANN

And you should tell Doris...

ANN

...You know how Big Dave loved

camping. And the out-of-doors.

ED

Yes?

ANN

We went camping last summer. In

Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene,

Ed.

ED

...Yes?

ANN

At night, there were lights--we both

saw them. We never told anyone,

outside of our official report.

ED

Ann--

ANN

A spacecraft. I saw the creatures.

They led Big Dave onto the craft. He

never told anyone what they did,

outside of his report. Of course he

told *me*. No one else.

ED

Ann--

ANN

The government knows. I cannot repeat

it to you. But this thing goes deep,

Ed. This was not your wife. I goes

deep, and involves the government.

There is a great deal of fear. You

know how certain circles would find

it--the knowledge--a threat. They

try to limit it, and--

ED

Ann, will you come in, sit down,

maybe have a drink?

ANN

Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed.

After this happened, things changed.

Big Dave... he never touched me again.

ANN

...Tell Doris not to worry. I know

it wasn't her. Perhaps this will

bring it out, finally. Perhaps now

it will all come out.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...It stinks.

DORIS

But it's true.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

I don't care it's true, it's not

true; it stinks. You say he was being

blackmailed; by who? You don't know.

For having an affair; with who? You

don't know. Did anyone else know

about it? Probably not; you don't

know.

ED

I knew about it. Big Dave told me

about it, and the spot he was putting

himself in by getting the money.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Terrific. Your husband backs you up.

That's terrific.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...You've gotta give me something to

work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is

good, but he's not a magician. He

can't just wave his little wand in

the air and make a plausible defense

materialize. Look. Look at what the

other side is gonna run at us. They

got the company books, prepared by

you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive.

They got a murder scene *you* had

access to. That's Opportunity. They

got that little trimmer thing he was

stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's*

weapon--

ED

It was Big Dave's.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

--don't interrupt me--that's Means.

They got a fine upstanding pillar of

the business community as a victim,

and then they got *you*, a disgruntled

number-juggling underling who on the

day in question was drunk as a skunk

and whose alibi for the time in

question is being passed out at home,

alone.

ED

*I* was with her.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Like I say, it stinks.

ED

...I killed him.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

OK, we forget the blackmail. *You*

killed him. How come?

ED

He and Doris... were having an affair.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

OK, how did you know?

ED

I... just knew. A husband knows.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Will anyone else say they knew?

ED

I don't know. I don't think so.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

How did you get into the store?

ED

I took Doris's keys.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Will anyone say they saw you there?

On your way there? In there? On your

was back?

ED

...I don't think so.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Will anyone corroborate and goddamn

part of your story at all?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Come on, people. You can't help

each other like that. Let's be

realistic now. Let's look at our

options. Well, frankly, I don't *see*

any options.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...I cannot present Story A.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...I cannot present Story B. I could

plead you for a nutcase but you look

too composed. I could offer a guilty

plea and in return they don't give

you the juice, but I don't think you

want to spend the rest of your life

in Chino and I know you didn't hire

Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your

hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell,

you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway

for that. No, we're not giving up

yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider,

it means you're *not* throwing in

the towel. I litigate, I don't

capitulate. All right, no options,

we gotta think. All right, we go

back to the blackmail thing. It

titillates, it's open ended...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...And it makes *him* the bad guy--

ya dig around, ya never know,

something unsavory from his past, he

approaches you to help with the money,

it's too late, his past comes back

to haunt him, who's to say...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous

husband thing, that's silly; we're

going with the blackmail. I'll be in

touch.

ED (V.O.)

Of course, there was *one* person

who could confirm Doris's story, or

plenty of it: the dry-cleaning

pansy...

ED (V.O.)

...But he'd left the hotel, skipped

out on his bill...

ED (V.O.)

He'd also disappeared from the

residence he gave me...

ED (V.O.)

...owing two month's rent. How could

I have been so stupid. Handing over

$10,000. For a piece of paper. And

the man gone... like a ghost...

ED (V.O.)

...disappeared into thin air,

vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki.

Gone now. All gone. The money gone.

Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could

I have been so stupid?

CUSTOMER

She makes this stuff, she calls it

gatto, it's got egg in there, it's

got sugar, it's got--it's cake,

basically, except she calls it gatto.

Like if you don't call it cake maybe

you won't put on any weight, like I

need to eat gatto, you know what I'm

saying? This stuff, if I've had a

square meal, I've had my steak and

potatoes, I can just have another

cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask

for the desert if it's not there...

ED (V.O.)

Sooner or later everyone needs a

haircut...

CUSTOMER

Got the recipe from a magazine,

woman's magazine...

ED (V.O.)

We were working for the bank now. We

kept cutting the hair, trying to

stay afloat, make the payments, tread

water, day by day, day by day...

ED (V.O.)

Most people think someone's accused

of a crime, they haul 'em in and

bring 'em to trial, but it's not

like that, it's not that fast. The

wheels of justice turn slow...

BAILIFF

...did willfully and with malice

aforethought take the life of one

David Allen Brewster, a human being...

ED (V.O.)

They have an arraignment, and then

the indictment, and they entertain

motions to dismiss, and postpone,

and change the venue, and alter this

and that and the other. They empanel

a jury, which brings more motions,

and they set a trial date and then

change the date, and then often as

not they'll change it again.

BAILIFF

What say you to these charges?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

We plead not guilty, your honor.

ED (V.O.)

And through all of it we cut the

hair.

CUSTOMER

I say, Honey, if you're gonna make a

cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler,

don't put a whole pan in front of me

and tell me it's not gonna be any

good when it's cold...

ED (V.O.)

...Meanwhile, Freddy Riedenschneider

slept at the Metropole...

ED (V.O.)

...and shoveled it in at DaVinci's.

ED (V.O.)

He'd brought in a private investigator

from Sacramento...

ED (V.O.)

...to nose around into Big Dave's

past.

ED (V.O.)

I found myself more and more going

over to the Abundas's. It was a

routine we fell into, most every

evening. I even went when Walter was

away on his research trips. He was a

genealogist, had traced back his

side of the family seven generations,

his late wife's, eight. It seemed

like a screwy hobby. But then maybe

all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found

something there, in the old county

courthouses, hospital file rooms,

city archives, property rolls,

registries, something maybe like

what I found listening to Birdy play.

Some kind of escape. Some kind of

peace...

ED

'Lo, honey.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...They got this guy, in Germany.

Fritz something-or-other. Or is it.

Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got

this theory, you wanna test something,

you know, scientifically--how the

planets  go round the sun, what

sunspots are made of, why the water

comes out of the tap--well, you gotta

look at it. But sometimes, you look

at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya

can't know the reality of what

happened, or what *would've* happened

if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn

schnozz. So there *is* no 'what

happened.' Not in any sense that we

can grasp with our puny minds. Because

our minds... out minds get in the

way. Looking at something changes

it. They call it the 'Uncertainty

Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy,

but even Einstein says the guy's on

to something.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Science. Perception. Reality.

Doubt...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin',

sometimes, the more you look, the

less you really know. It's a fact. A

proved fact. In a way, it's the only

fact there is. This heinie even wrote

it out in numbers.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Burns?

BURNS

Subject: David Allen Brewster. Born:

Cincinnati, 1911. Father: insurance

salesman; mother: homemaker. One

year Case Western University on

football scholarship. Flunks out.

1931: retail appliance salesman in

Barnhoff's department store,

Cincinnati. 1933: meets Ann

Nirdlinger, married later that year,

moves here. 1935: arrested on an

assault complaint; complainant, an

organizer for the ILGWU, has a broken

nose, couple of ribs, wife's family

intercedes, some kind of settlement,

charges dropped. 1936: another assault

beef, bar altercation--

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go

to his service record.

BURNS

...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned

to fifth fleet US Navy, petty officer

first class, serves in clerical

capacity in US naval shipyards in

San Diego, one fistfight broken up

by MPs, no court martial, honorable

discharge May 8, 1945. Since then

he's been clean.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Thank you, Burns, get lost.

ED

...So?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's

ticket out of the deathhouse, so!

ED

...I don't get it.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Look, chum, this is a guy, from what

I understand, told everybody he was

a war hero, right? Island hopping,

practically liberated the Pacific

all by himself with a knife in one

hand and a gun in the other and twenty

yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

ED

Yeah.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

And now it turns out this dope spent

the war sitting on his ass in some

boatyard in San Diego. You asked for

blackmail, let me give you blackmail:

Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to

open his own business here, has been

lying to everybody in this town for

the last four years, probably

including half the people sitting on

that jury. Well, it finally caught

up with him--these dopes, it always

does; someone threatened to spill

it. Somebody knew his dirty little

secret, just like your wife says.

They called, they demanded money...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Did Big Dave mention that it was

something about his war service? I

don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll*

have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified,

maybe he didn't; I'm not putting

words in your mouth; the point is

that this liar, this cynical

manipulator, this man who through

his lies sneered and belittled the

sacrifice and heroism of all our

boys who *did* serve and bleed and

puke and die on foreign shores, and

who made a fool out of this entire

town, turns to *you* to help him out

of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

ED

So... who... who actually--

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But

the point is that if Mr Prosecutor

over there had devoted half the time

he's spent persecuting *this* woman

to even the most cursory investigation

of this schmoe's past, then we might

*know* who! But we can't *know* what

really happened! Because of Fritz,

or Werner, or whatever the hell his

name is! And because Me Prosecutor

is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch

who decided it's easier to victimize

your wife! Because it's easier *not*

to look! Because the more you look,

the less you know! But the beauty of

it is, we don't *gotta* know! We

just gotta show that, goddamnit,

*they* don't know. Reasonable doubt.

Science. The atom. *You* explain it

to me. Go ahead. Try.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees

daylight. We got a real shot at this,

folks. Let's not get cocky.

ED

Honey...?

ED

...Honey?

DORIS

What a dope.

BIRDY

He was deaf when he wrote this.

ED

Who?

BIRDY

Beethoven. He created it, and yet he

never actually heard it. I suppose

he heard it all in his head, somehow.

ED (V.O.)

So maybe Riedenschneider could get

Doris off. Maybe it would all work

out. And I thought--I hoped--that

maybe there was a way out for me as

well...

ED (V.O.)

The girl had talent, anyone could

see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-

by-nighter, she was just a good clean

kid...

ED (V.O.)

...If she was going to have a career

she'd need a responsible adult looking

out for her...

ED (V.O.)

...some kind of... manager. She'd

have contracts to look at, be going

on tours, playing on the radio maybe.

I could help her sort through all of

that, without charging her an arm

and a leg, just enough to get by...

ED (V.O.)

...I could afford to charge less

than the usual manager, not having

to put up a big front like a lot of

these phonies. And I could be with

her, enough to keep myself feeling

OK...

ED (V.O.)

...Why couldn't that work?... Why

not?...

BIRDY

Hi, Mr Crane.

ED

Hello, Birdy. I thought that was

very good.

BIRDY

Oh, in there? I messed up a little

bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody

noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is

Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr

Crane.

ED

Hello, Tony.

TONY

Hello, sir.

ED

...Well, congratulations. I guess

I'll be getting home.

TONY

Nice to meet you, sir.

ED (V.O.)

...Anyway, that's what I was thinking

about in the days leading up to the

trial. It seemed like once that was

over, I'd be ready for a new start.

Freddy Riedenschneider was very

optimistic. He was busy preparing...

ED (V.O.)

...And finally it came... the first

day of the trial...

ED (V.O.)

...What Riedenschneider called the

Big Show.

FRANK

Where's the judge? How come there's

no judge?

FRANK

...Where's the judge, Ed?

FRANK

...How come the judge doesn't come

out?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

The judge comes in last. He'll come

in when Doris gets here.

FRANK

So where's Doris? I thought we started

at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's

Doris?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

She's late.

FRANK

Late? How can she be late?

FRANK

...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us*

are in prison, and yet we're not

late. We're on time, Ed. How can

Doris be late? What, they don't have

wake-up calls?

JUDGE

Counselors.

FRANK

What's going on, Ed? I thought there

would be arguments. The bailiff, and

so forth...

FRANK

...Ed, what is this? Is this

procedure?

JUDGE

Bailiff.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

I don't understand... We had a real

shot at it... We could have won this

thing...

BAILIFF

In the matter of the State of

California versus Doris Crane, Case

Number 87249 assigned to this Superior

Court...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...It doesn't make any sense...

ED (V.O.)

She'd hanged herself. I'd brought

her a dress to wear to court and

she'd used the belt. I didn't

understand it either. At first I

thought maybe it had something to do

with me, that she'd figured out

somehow how I fit into it and couldn't

stand it, couldn't stand knowing...

ED (V.O.)

...That wasn't it, I would find out

later. For now, everything just seemed

ruined...

ED (V.O.)

...Freddy Riedenschneider went back

to Sacramento still shaking his head,

saying it was the biggest

disappointment of his professional

career...

ED (V.O.)

...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect

he was drinking; anyway, he stopped

coming to work...

ED (V.O.)

...That left me to keep the place

going, or the bank would've taken

it.

ED (V.O.)

...*I* was the principal barber now.

I hired a new man for the second

chair...

ED (V.O.)

...I'd hired the guy who did the

least gabbing when he came in for an

interview. But I guess the new man

had only kept quiet because he was

nervous; once he had the job, he

talked from the minute I opened the

shop in the morning...

ED (V.O.)

...until I locked up at night. For

all I know, he talked to himself on

the way home.

ED (V.O.)

...When *I* walked home, it seemed

like everyone avoided looking at

me...

ED (V.O.)

...as if I'd caught some disease.

This thing with Doris, nobody wanted

to talk about it; it was like I was

a ghost walking down the street...

ED (V.O.)

...And when I got home now, the place

felt empty.

ED (V.O.)

...I sat in the house, but there was

nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't

see anyone; no one saw me...

ED (V.O.)

...I was the barber.

FADE OUT

VOICE 1

So two blocks later I look at the

change she gave me and, golly, I'm

two bits short.

VOICE 2

Two bits short.

VOICE 1

So I walk back over to Linton's,

find this gal--big argument; she

doesn't even recall the transaction.

VOICE 2

No recollection.

VOICE 1

Doesn't recall the transaction, no

recollection, so I said, Look, dear...

NEW MAN

...go ahead, look at the menu, if

you're in before six o'clock it's

the, whatchamacallit, the--

CUSTOMER

Early Bird Special.

NEW MAN

What? Yeah, the Early Riser...

VOICE

Crane?

ED

...I'm Crane.

MAN

My name is Diedrickson. County medical

examiner.

ED

Yeah?

DIEDRICKSON

Just came for an informal chat...

DIEDRICKSON

...Why don't I buy you a drink?

ED

Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?

DWIGHT

Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your

time.

DIEDRICKSON

Rye.

ED

Just coffee.

DIEDRICKSON

You sure you don't want something

stiffer?

BARTENDER

Coffee it is.

DIEDRICKSON

...County M. E. does an autopsy on

anyone who dies in custody. I don't

know if you knew that. It's routine.

DIEDRICKSON

...Doesn't become a matter of public

record unless there's foul play.

However. I don't believe I'm

*prohibited* from telling you this.

I guess I'm not obliged to tell you,

either. I don't exactly know.  But

if *I* were the man, I'd want to be

told.

ED

Told what?

DIEDRICKSON

I, uh... thanks.

DIEDRICKSON

...I'm sorry to add to your burden,

Crane, but I'd want to know it it

was me. Your wife was pregnant. First

trimester.

DIEDRICKSON

...Well, there it is.

DIEDRICKSON

...I'm sorry.

DIEDRICKSON

...Hell, I hope I've done the right

thing.

ED

My wife and I had not... performed

the sex act in many years.

DIEDRICKSON

(murmuring)

...Jesus.

(aloud)

...Well, that's not really my

business.

DIEDRICKSON

...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.

DIEDRICKSON

...Good luck, Crane.

ED (V.O.)

Doris and I had never really talked

much. I don't think that's a bad

thing, necessarily. But it was funny:

now I wanted to talk--now, with

everyone gone. I was alone, with

secrets I didn't want and no one to

tell them to anyway.

ED (V.O.)

I visited a woman who was supposed

to have powers in communicating with

those who had passed across, as she

called it. She said that people who

passed across were picky about who

they'd communicate with, not like

most people you run into on this

side...

WOMAN

Giff me your hant.

ED (V.O.)

...so you needed a guide who they

didn't mind talking to, someone with

a gift for talking to souls...

ED (V.O.)

...Well, first she told me that my

wife was in a peaceful place, that

our souls were still connected by

some spiritual bond, that she had

never stopped loving me even though

she'd done some things she wasn't

proud of...

ED (V.O.)

...She was reading me like a book.

ED (V.O.)

...And then she started talking about

'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that

and was there anything I wanted to

tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just

be telling it to the old bat. And

even if somehow Doris could hear, it

wouldn't be on account of this so-

called medium.

ED (V.O.)

She was a phony. Just another gabber.

ED (V.O.)

I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger,

Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my

back on the old lady, on the veils,

on the ghosts, on the dead, before

they all sucked me in...

WALTER

Ed, how're you holding up?

ED

I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

WALTER

I'm so damn sorry about your loss.

Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.

ED

Yeah.

WALTER

Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long

distance here.

ED

Sure, Walter. Thanks.

BIRDY

Hello, Mr Crane.

ED

Hello, Birdy.

BIRDY

We haven't seen you since... I'm

terribly sorry.

ED

Yeah.

BIRDY

We've certainly missed you.

ED

Birdy, I've been doing a lot of

thinking. There are a lot of things

that haven't worked out for me. Life

has dealt me some bum cards...

ED

...or maybe I just haven't played

'em right, I don't know. But you're--

BIRDY

Pop doesn't like people smoking in

here.

ED

Oh. Sorry.

BIRDY

Sometimes I have a cigarette in here

when he's away. Never when he's in

the house. He can smell it a mile

off.

ED

Sure... Sure, it's his house.

BIRDY

That's what he keeps telling me.

ED

Anyway, uh... my point is you're

young. A kid really, your whole life

ahead of you. But it's not too soon

to start thinking... to start making

opportunities for yourself. Before

it all washes away.

BIRDY

Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so

too. I work pretty hard at school.

ED

That's swell. However, the music, if

you want to pursue it, well, the

lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only

take you so far. There's this guy in

San Francisco, I've made inquiries,

everybody says he's the best. Trained

lots of people who've gone on to

have big concert careers, symphony

orchestras, the works. His name is

Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure

I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway,

he's a Frenchman.

BIRDY

Boy.

ED

You've got talent, anyone could see

that. And he's the best. If he thinks

a student has talent, he'll take 'em

on for next to nothing. You're a

cinch to be accepted, I could cover

the cost of the lessons, like I said,

it's pretty modest--

BIRDY

Oh, Mr Crane--

ED

I have to do it. I can't stand by

and watch more things go down the

drain. You're young, you don't

understand.

BIRDY

Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't

really thought about a career or

stuff.

ED

I know you haven't. Look, just go

meet him as a favor to me. I talked

to this guy. Hope I pronounced his

name right. He sounded very busy,

but he's not a bad egg; he loosened

up a little when I told him how

talented you are. He agreed to see

you this Saturday. He said maybe you

were a diamond in the rough. His

words.

BIRDY

Geez, Mr Crane.

ED

Just see him, as a favor to me.

CARCANOGUES

...You are ze fahzer?

ED

No. Uh... family friend.

MAN

I am Carcanogues.

MAN

...You wait, my dear?

BIRDY

Sure, Mr K.

CARCANOGUES

I speak to you on ze phone, non? You

have a special interest in music?

ED

Uh-huh.

CARCANOGUES

Ah yes, a music lover.

ED

Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.

CARCANOGUES

Ah.

CARCANOGUES

...Ah-hah.

CARCANOGUES

...Mm.

ED

Well? How'd she do?

CARCANOGUES

Ze girl?... She seems like a very

nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur,

like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very

nice girl. However, ztinks.

ED

I don't understand.

CARCANOGUES

Is not so hard to understand. Her

playing, very polite.

ED

Did she make mistakes?

CARCANOGUES

Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she

plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the

right note, always. Very proper.

ED

I don't understand, no mistakes,

she's just a kid--I thought you taught

the, uh, the--

CARCANOGUES

Ah, but that is just what I cannot

teach. I cannot teach her to have a

soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano,

is not about the fingers. *Done*

with the fingers, yes. But the music,

she is inside. Inside, monsieur...

CARCANOGUES

...The music start here...

CARCANOGUES

...come out through here; then,

maybe...

CARCANOGUES

...she can go up there.

ED

Well, look, I don't claim to be an

expert--

CARCANOGUES

Then you listen to me, for I am

expert. That girl, she give me a

headache. She cannot play. Nice girl.

Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday,

I think, maybe, she make a very good

typist.

BIRDY

...I stank, didn't I?

ED

He didn't say that.

BIRDY

But more or less.

ED

Look, I'm no expert, but--

BIRDY

It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.

ED

I'm sure there's a dozen teachers

better than this clown. More

qualified. Goddamn phony.

BIRDY

But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm

not interested in playing music

professionally.

BIRDY

...I'm not certain I'll have a career

at all, and if I do, I'll probably

be a veterinarian.

ED

...Uh-huh.

BIRDY

I do appreciate the interest you've

taken, though.

ED

Ah... it's nothing.

BIRDY

I'm only sorry that I didn't play

better for you. I know it would've

made you happy. You know what you

are?

ED

Huh.

BIRDY

You're an enthusiast.

ED

Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

ED

...I guess I've been all wet.

BIRDY

But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

BIRDY

...I wanted to make you happy.

ED

Birdy--

BIRDY

It's OK...

BIRDY

...I want to do it, Mr Crane.

ED

Birdy!

ED

...No, please.

BIRDY

Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

ED (V.O.)

Time slows down right before an

accident, and I had time to think

about things. I thought about what

an undertaker had told me once--that

your hair keeps growing, for a while

anyway, after you die...

ED (V.O.)

...and then it stops. I thought,

what keeps it growing? Is it like a

plant in soil? What goes out of the

soil? The soul? And when does the

hair realize that it's gone?

MAN

Hello!

ED

Hello.

MAN

I notice you still have peastone in

your driveway.

MAN

Well, of course, you don't have to

rejuvenate that once every couple of

years, don't you, when the peastone

thins out.

MAN

...Where does it go, huh? Like the

odd sock. But you *know* where it

goes--you probably pick pieces of it

off your lawn all the time, churn it

up with your lawn mower, sweep it

off the walk here--pain in the neck.

ED

Doesn't bother me.

MAN

Well, have you ever considered tar

Macadam? People think it's just for

public works and commercial purposes,

roads, parking lots, so forth...

MAN

...but we have the technology now to

bring it to the homeowner, the

individual consumer, at a very

reasonable price.

MAN

...Mind if I show you the

specifications?--Evening, ma'am.

DORIS

What're *you* selling?

MAN

Well, ma'am, I was just telling your

husband here about tar Macadam, for

your home driveway here--these are

the specs...

MAN

...It's the modern way to--

DORIS

Get lost.

ED

...Doris--

DORIS

Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

FADE OUT

VOICE

Are you there? Are you awake?

DOCTOR

He's coming around. Can you talk,

sir? These men have to talk.

DOCTOR

...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.

PERSKY

Are you awake?... Is he awake?

KREBS

Crane? We have to tell you, as soon

as you're conscious--is he conscious?

PERSKY

His eyes are open.

KREBS

Uh... you're under arrest.

PERSKY

As soon as the doctor lets us, we

gotta move you. Does he understand

that? We're supposed to tell him.

Are you conscious?

KREBS

You'll go to the prison hospital.

PERSKY

Under arrest for murder.

ED

Birdy... I didn't mean to--

KREBS

What'd he say?

ED

Birdy...

DOCTOR

Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK.

Broken clavicle.

DOCTOR

...That's the collarbone, Crane.

Broken. She's OK though.

KREBS

So he understands? He's under arrest

for murder?

ED

Big Dave.

PERSKY

Huh?

KREBS

What'd he say? Does he understand?

PERSKY

He said OK. Is that what he said?

KREBS

You're under arrest for the murder

of Creighton Tolliver! Do you

understand?

PERSKY

...Does he understand?...

FADE OUT

ED (V.O.)

The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole

outside of town had found his car...

ED (V.O.)

...They'd winched it out...

ED (V.O.)

...and found he'd been beaten, just

like Big Dave said--beaten to death...

ED (V.O.)

...Inside the briefcase were the

partnership papers I'd signed...

ED (V.O.)

...showing that I'd given him ten

grand. For the district attorney...

ED (V.O.)

...that made it fall into place: I'd

gotten Doris to steal the money, the

pansy had gotten wise somehow, and

I'd had to kill him to cover my

tracks. I was in a spot. I called in

Freddy Riedenschneider...

ED (V.O.)

...and signed the house over to him.

He said he didn't ordinarily work

that cheap, but he figured he owed

me something since the last one hadn't

played out...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Not guilty, your honor...

ED (V.O.)

I tried to tell him the whole story,

but Riedenschneider stopped me. He

said the story made his head hurt,

and anyway he didn't see any way of

using it without putting me on the

hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

ED (V.O.)

...He told me not to worry, though,

said he'd think of something, Freddy

Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.

ED (V.O.)

...They put me on twenty-four-hour

deathwatch...

ED (V.O.)

...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice

like they said my wife had done...

ED (V.O.)

...But in front of the jury they had

it that Doris was a saint; the whole

plan had been mine, I was a Svengali

who'd forced Doris to join my criminal

enterprise...

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

...cynically used his own wife as a

cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical

cunning...

ED (V.O.)

On and on it went, how I'd used Doris

and then let her take the fall. That

stuff smarted because some of it was

close to being true...

ED (V.O.)

...And then it was Freddy

Riedenschneider's turn.

ED (V.O.)

...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed

a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked

about how I'd lost my place in the

universe...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...a puny player on the great world's

stage...

ED (V.O.)

...how I was too ordinary to be the

criminal mastermind the D.A. made me

out to be, how there was some greater

scheme at work that the state had

yet to unravel, and he threw in some

of the old truth stuff he hadn't had

a chance to trot out for Doris...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...who among us is in a position to

say...

ED (V.O.)

...He told them to look at me--look

at me close. That the closer they

looked the less sense it would all

make, that I wasn't the kind of guy

to kill a guy, that I was the barber,

for Christ's sake...

ED (V.O.)

...I was just like them, an ordinary

man, guilty of living in a world

that had no place for me, guilty of

wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure,

but not of murder...

ED (V.O.)

...He said I *was* Modern Man, and

if they voted to convict me, well,

they'd be practically cinching the

noose around their own necks. He

told them to look not at the facts

but at the meaning of the facts, and

then he said the facts *had* no

meaning. It was a pretty good speech,

and even had me going...

ED (V.O.)

...until Frankie interrupted it.

FRANK

What kind of man *are* you? What

kind of man *are* you?

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

Move for a mistrial, your honor!

Move for a mistrial! This outrageous

display cannot help but prejudice...

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

...and inflame the passions of these

twelve fine men and women...

ED (V.O.)

...Well, he got his mistrial, but

the well had run dry. There was

nothing left to mortgage;

Riedenschneider went home and the

court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

GARROWAY

Your honor, we plead guilty, with

extenuating circumstances.

ED (V.O.)

...who threw me on the mercy of the

court. It was my only chance, he

said. I guess that meant I never had

a chance...

JUDGE

...a menace to society... a predator

on his own wife, his business

associates, on an innocent young

girl... social contract... line

crossed... the offender forfeits the

right to his own life... I hereby

order that you be taken to a place

of confinement...

ED (V.O.)

He wasn't buying any of that Modern

Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,

or any of the mercy stuff either.

No, he was going by the book, and

the book said I got the chair...

ED (V.O.)

...so here I am. At first I didn't

know how I got here. I knew step by

step of course, which is what I've

told you, step by step; but I couldn't

see any pattern...

ED (V.O.)

...Now that I'm near the end, I'm

glad that this men's magazine paid

me to tell my story. Writing it has

helped me sort it all out. They're

paying five cents a word, so you'll

pardon me if sometimes I've told you

more than you wanted to know...

ED (V.O.)

...But now, all the disconnected

things seems to hook up.

ED (V.O.)

...That's the funny thing about going

away, knowing the date you're gonna

die--and the men's magazine wanted

me to tell how that felt...

ED (V.O.)

...Well, it's like pulling away from

the maze. While you're in the maze

you go through willy-nilly, turning

where you think you have to turn,

banging into dead ends, one thing

after another...

ED (V.O.)

...But get some distance on it, and

all those twists and turns, why,

they're the shape of your life. It's

hard to explain...

ED (V.O.)

...But seeing it whole gives you

some peace.

ED (V.O.)

...The men's magazine also asked

about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm

sorry about the pain I caused other

people...

ED (V.O.)

...but I don't regret anything. Not

a thing. I used to. I used to regret

being the barber.

ED (V.O.)

...I dont know where I'm being taken.

ED (V.O.)

...I don't know what waits for me,

beyond the earth and sky. But I'm

not afraid to go.

ED (V.O.)

...Maybe the things I don't understand

will be clearer there, like when a

fog blows away...

ED (V.O.)

...Maybe Doris will be there.

ED (V.O.)

...And maybe there I can tell her...

ED (V.O.)

...all those things...

ED (V.O.)

...they don't have words for here.
