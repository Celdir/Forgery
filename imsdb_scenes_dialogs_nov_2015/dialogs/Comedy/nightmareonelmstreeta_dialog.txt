A Nightmare on Elm Street, by Wes Craven

Wes Craven's

A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET

1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A.

-- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking

through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-

dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it

is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.

Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,

reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.

-- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey

WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight

razor, until its fingertips are off.

-- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives

out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,

curved, gleaming sharp.

-- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's

wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen

his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal

being assembled with crude tools, into some sort

of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,

against a background light of FIRE, and a deep

rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.

-- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.

-- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.

-- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like

apparatus, filling it out and transforming

it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with

four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened

fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES

FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing

it to shreds.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

You okay, Tina?

TINA

Just a dream, Ma...

(more to herself)

Damn dream, is all...

TINA'S MOTHER

Some dream, judging from that.

MAN (OS)

(distant, annoyed)

You coming back to the sack or

what?

TINA'S MOTHER

Hold your horses.

(lower, to Tina as she

stands to leave)

You gotta cut your nails or stop

that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One

or the other.

TINA

Oh, shit.

TINA

(referring to kids' song)

That's what it reminded me of --

that old jump rope song.

(shudders)

Worst nightmare I ever had.

You wouldn't believe it.

NANCY

Matter of fact I had a bad dream

last night myself...

ROD

(to Tina)

Had a hardon this morning when

I woke up, Tina.  Had your name

written all over it.

TINA

There's four letters in my name,

Rod.  How could there be room

on your joint for four letters?

ROD

Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn

mower!

TINA

Rod says the sweetest things.

NANCY

He's nuts about you.

TINA

Yeah, nuts.

TINA (CONTD)

(yawns)

Anyway, I'm too tired to worry

about the creep.  Couldn't get

back to sleep at all.

(beat)

So what you dream?

NANCY

Forget it, the point is,

every

-

body has nightmares once in a while.

No biggy.

GLEN

Next time you have one, just

tell yourself that's just all

it is, right while you're having

it, y'know?  That's the trick.

Once you do that, you wake right

up.  At least it works for me.

TINA

Hey!  You have a nightmare too?

TINA (CONTD)

Maybe we're gonna have the Big

Earthquake.  They say things get

weird just before that...

9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9.

TINA

I can't believe his mother let him

come over here.

NANCY

Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...

GLEN

(to TINA)

See, I got this cousin who lives

near the airport, that it's okay

for me to stay with, right?  So I

found this sound effects tape at

Licorice Pizza, and...

GLEN (CONTD)

Hello, Mom?

(pushes the 'play' button)

Yeah, out here at Barry's.

GLEN (CONT)

Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad

we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,

Aunt Eunice says hello.

GLEN (CONT)

(shouting over the din)

Right, right -- I'll call you in the

morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,

I, huh?...

GLEN (CONT)

(reacting to his mother's

reaction)

Uh... some kid's drag racing

outside, I think...

GLEN (CONT)

Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I

think there's been an accident out

front -- I --

GLEN (CONT)

Right.  I'll call the police.  No,

just some neighbors having a fight,

I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!

Call you in the morning!

NANCY

Worked like a charm.

GLEN

Jesus.

NANCY

Nice to have a fire.

TINA

Really.  Turn 'er up a little.

NANCY

Maybe we should call Rod, have him

come over too.  He might get jealous.

TINA

Rod and I are done.  He's too much

of a maniac.

GLEN

He should join the Marines, they

could make something out of him.

Like a hand grenade.

NANCY

See?  You've forgotten the bad

dream.  Didn't I tell you?

TINA

All day long I been seeing that

guy's weird face, and hearing

those fingernails...

NANCY

Fingernails?

(blinks, laughing)

That's amazing, you saying that.

It made me remember the dream I

had last night.

TINA

What you dream?

NANCY

I dreamed about this guy in a

dirty red and yellow sweater;

I dream in color, y'know; he

walked into the room I was in,

right, right through the wall,

like it was smoke or something,

and just stared at me.  Sort of

...obscenely.  Then he walked

out through the wall on the

other side.  Like he'd just

come to check me out...

TINA

(quietly)

So what about the fingernails?

NANCY

He scraped his fingernails

along things -- actually, they

were more like fingerknives or

something, like he'd made them

himself?  Anyway, they made

this horrible nose --

(imitates)

sssssccrrrtttt

....

TINA

Nancy.  You dreamed about the

same creep I did, Nancy...

GLEN

That's impossible.

TINA

What?

GLEN

Nothing.

TINA

There's somebody out there,

isn't

there...

NANCY

I didn't hear anything...

10.   EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                      10.

GLEN

I'm gonna punch out your ugly

lights, whoever you are.

GLEN

It's just a stupid cat.

NANCY

Then bring us back its tail

and whiskers.

TINA

Anyway, I don't have a cat...

GLEN

Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?

11.   REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11.

ROD

And it's number thirty-six, Rod

Lane, bringing Lantz down just

three yards from the goal with a

brilliant tackle!  And the fans

go wild!

TINA

What the hell you doing here?

ROD

Came to make up, no big deal.

Your ma home?

TINA

Of course.  What's that?

ROD

Intense, huh?

(sizes up the three)

So what's happening, an orgy or

something?

GLEN

Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.

NANCY

-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.

Just Tina and me.  Glen was just

leaving.

ROD

You see his face?

(lower)

Your ma ain't home,

is

she?

(to Nancy & Glen)

Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

NANCY

Rod...

ROD

We got her mother's bed.

You two got the rest.

NANCY

We should get her out of here...

TINA

Hey -- you guys're hanging around --

right?

(fake laughing/whine)

Don't leave me alone with this

lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!

GLEN

So we'll guard her together.

Through the night.

(moving closer)

In each others' arms like

we always said.

NANCY

Glen.  Not now.  I mean,

we're here for Tina now,

not for ourselves.

GLEN

(frustrated)

Why's she so bothered by a

stupid nightmare, anyway?

NANCY

Because he was scary, that's

why.

GLEN

Who was scary?

NANCY

Don't you think it's weird, her

and me dreaming about the same

guy?

(GLEN looks away;

NANCY stares closer)

You didn't have a bad dream

last night, did you?

GLEN

Me?  I don't dream.

TINA

I knew there was sometihng

about you I liked...

ROD

You feel better now, right?

TINA

Jungle man fix Jane.

ROD

No more fights?

TINA

No more fights.

ROD

(sleepily)

Good.  No more nightmares for

either of us then.

TINA

(beat)

When did you have a nightmare?

ROD

(under the blankets)

Guys can have nightmares too,

y'know.  You ain't got a corner

on the fucking market or something.

TINA

(sleepily)

Where'd you get this snotty old

thing?

She's still awake.  Nancy can't

PARKER

Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to

wake you, but --

LT THOMPSON

I'd've canned your ass if you

hadn't.  What you got?

PARKER

Her name was Tina Gray.  It

was her home.  Father abandoned

ten years ago, mother's in

Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're

trying to reach her now.

LT THOMPSON

What's the Coroner got to say?

PARKER

Something like a razor was

the weapon, but nothing

found on the scene.

SERGEANT GARCIA

(wary)

Leautenant.  You know who --

LT THOMPSON

Where is she?

SERGEANT GARCIA

I put her in your office...

PARKER

Looks like her boyfriend did

it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type,

arrests for brawling, dope --

LT THOMPSON

Terrific.  What the hell was

she doing there?

PARKER

She lived there.

LT THOMPSON

OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37.

38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38.

LT THOMPSON (CONTD)

I mean you.

(accusingly, to Marge)

What the hell was she doing there?

MARGE

Hello to you, too, Donald.

LT THOMPSON

Marge.

LT THOMPSON (CONTD)

How you doing, pal?

NANCY

Okay.  Hi, dad.

LT THOMPSON

I don't want to get into this now,

god knows you need time.

(hotter)

But I'd sure would like to know

what the hell you were doing

shacked up with three other kids

in the middle of the night --

especially a delinquent lunatic

like Lane.

NANCY

Rod's not a lunatic.

LT THOMPSON

You got a sane explanation for

what he did?

MARGE

Apparantly he was crazy jealous.

Nancy said they'd had a fight,

Rod and Tina.

NANCY

(quietly)

It wasn't that serious...

MARGE

Maybe

you

don't think murder's

serious --

NANCY

She was my best friend!  Don't

you dare say I don't take her

death seriously!

(lower, near tears)

I just meant their fights

weren't that serious.

NANCY (CONTD)

(to herself)

She dreamed this would happen...

LT THOMPSON

What?

NANCY

She had a nightmare about somebody

trying to kill her, last night.

That's why we were there; she was

afraid to sleep alone.

MARGE

She's been through enough for one

night.  You have her statement.

LT THOMPSON

(to MARGE)

I suggest you keep a little better

track on her -- she's still a kid,

y'know.

MARGE

You think I knew there were boys

there!?

You

try raising a

teenager alone.

LT THOMPSON

(low to PARKER)

See they get home okay.

THE SECOND DAY

TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER)

In the headlines this morning --

a local teenage girl was brutally

murdered during an all-night party.

TV NEWSCASTER (CONTD)

Police say the victim, fifteen-year

-old Christina Grey, had quarrelled

earlier with her boyfriend, Rod

Lane, a punk rocker with a history

of delinquency.  Lane is now the

subject of a city-wide manhunt.

According to --

39A.  The TV PICTURE has begun featuring a HANDHELD NEWSREEL SHOT of a

39B.  WIDER -- as NANCY pales visible.  MARGE darts to the TV and slaps

MARGE

(kind)

Where you think you're going?

NANCY

School.

MARGE

I could hear you tossing and

turning all night, kiddo.  You've

no business going to school.

NANCY

I gotta go to school, Mom.

Please.  Otherwise I'll just

sit up there and go crazy

or something.

MARGE

Did

you sleep?

NANCY

I'll sleep in study hall, promise.

I'd rather keep busy, you know?

MARGE

Right home after.

NANCY (cont'd)

Right home after.  See you.

40B.  NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again.    40B.

40C.  IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone.                                 40C.

ROD

I'm not gonna hurt you.

ROD

Your old man thinks I did it,

don't he?

NANCY

He doesn't know you.

(eyeing the blood)

Couldn't you change?

ROD

The cops were all over my house.

(shivers)

They'll kill me for sure.

NANCY

Nobody's gonna kill you.

ROD

I never touched her.

NANCY

You were screaming like crazy.

ROD

Someone else was there.

NANCY

The door was locked from your

side.

ROD

Don't look at me like I'm some

kind of fucking fruitcake or

something, I'm warning you.

VOICE (O.S.)

Morning, Mr. Lane.

42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42.

LT THOMPSON

Now just step away from her, son.

Like your ass depended on it.

I'm warning

you

NANCY

No!

THOMPSON

Jesus -- are you crazy!?

I didn't do it -- !

(fading)

I didn't kill her, Nancy!

NANCY

You used me, daddy!

LT THOMPSON

(exasperated)

What the hell you doing going to

school today, anyway -- your

mother told me you didn't even

sleep last night!

LT THOMPSON

Nancy!  Hey!

TEACHER

According to Shakespeare, there

was something operating in Nature,

perhaps inside human nature itself,

that was rotten -- a canker, as

he put it.

TEACHER (CONTD)

Of course Hamlet's response to

this, and to his mother's lies,

was to continually probe and

dig -- just like the gravediggers --

always trying to get beneath the

surface.  The same was true in a

different way in Julius Caesar.

Jon, go ahead...

SURFER

(reading aloud)

Uh, In the most high and palmy

state of Rome...

WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)

California's the most high and

palmy state, man.

ENGLISH TEACHER

Can it.

SURFER (O.S.)

In the most high and palmy state

of Rome, a little ere the mightiest

Julius fell...

(NANCY's head pitches

forward; she jerks it

back up, barely awake)

The graves stood tenantless, and

the sheeted dead did squeak and

gibber in the Roman street...

TINA (O.S.)

Nancy.

45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45.

46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46.

47.   REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty.  But there's a    47.

48.   NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class.  No one else  48.

SURFER

O God, I could be bounded in a

nutshell and count myself a king

of infinite space, were it not

that I have bad dreams...

52.   ANGLE AT THE FLOOR.  A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up  52.

HALLGUARD

Y-you're not supposed to run.

W-where's your pass -- you got a

pass?

NANCY

Screw your stupid pass!

53.   She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53.

HALLGUARD

Hey, no running in the halls!

NANCY

Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

LT THOMPSON

Only family allowed, Nancy.  You

know the drill.

NANCY

Just want to talk to him a second.

LT THOMPSON

He's dangerous.

NANCY

You don't know he did it.

LT THOMPSON

No, I know, thanks to your

own testimony, that he was

locked in a room with a girl

who went in alive and came

out in a rubber bag.

I just want to talk to him.

And then what happened?

ROD

I told you.

It was dark, but I'm sure there

ROD

No.

NANCY

Well then how can you say

somebody else was there?

ROD

Because somebody cut her.  While

I watched.

NANCY

Somebody cut her while you watched

and you don't know what he looked

like?

ROD

You couldn't

see

the fucker.

You could just see the cuts

happening, all at once.

NANCY

What you mean 'all at once'?

ROD

(low)

I mean, it was as if there were

four razors cutting her at the

same time.  But invisible razors.

She just... opened up...

NANCY

Rod!

ROD

I probably could've saved her

if I'd moved sooner...  But I

thought it was just another

It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.

SGT GARCIA

It's three in the morning.

Your mother know you're out this

late?

NANCY

(faking it)

Of course -- look, at least go

back and

look

at him.  Just see

if he's okay.

GLEN

(faking it)

We have reason to think there

might be something weird going

on.

LT THOMPSON (OS)

Oh, no argument on that.

NANCY

Dad -- what you doing here?

LT THOMPSON

It so happens I work here, and

there's an unsolved murder.  I

don't like unsolved murders,

especially ones my daughter's

mixed up in -- what are

you

doing here at this hour?  You're

supposed to be getting some

sleep.

GLEN

Listen, sir, this is serious.

Nancy had a nightmare about Rod

being in danger, or something,

and so she thinks...

NANCY

I just want to see if he's okay!

start throwing in insanity!

She's tougher than you think.

Any idea how she knew Rod was

gonna kill himself?

No.  All I know is, this reminds

I don't know who he is.  But he's

burned, he wears a weird hat, a

red and yellow sweater, real

dirty, and he uses some sort of

knifes he's got made into a sort

of... glove.  Like giant finger-

nails.

I think you should keep Nancy

happens to have gone through

her dreams are real...

DR KING (CONTD)

Typical dream parameter.  A

nightmare, now, would be plus or

minus five or six; she's just

around three point --

MARGE

What the hell's this?  She

awake or asleep?

DR KING

Can't be.  It never gets

this high...

DR KING (CONTD)

Jesus H. Christ.

and greying before their very

eyes

!

MARGE

NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!

DR KING

Now, this is just going to let

you relax and sleep, Nan --

NANCY

No.  That's enough sleep.

DR KING

Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.

MARGE

Oh my god, oh my god...

DR KING

(to the NURSE)

Get the kit!

NANCY

You believe this?

MARGE

(deathly pale)

Where the hell did you get that?

NANCY

I grabbed it off his head.

FADE TO BLACK

MARGE

She said she snatched it off

his head in a dream.

(listens)

No, I'm not crazy, I've got

the damn thing in my hand!

(listens)

I know we did, we all...

(hears NANCY

approaching)

Gotta go.

MARGE (CONTD)

You didn't sleep, did you?

The doctor says you have to

sleep or you'll --

NANCY

Go even crazier?

MARGE

I don't think you're going

crazy -- and stop drinking

that damn coffee!

NANCY

Did you ask Daddy to have the

hat examined?

MARGE

I threw that filthy thing away --

I don't know what you're trying

to prove with it, but --

NANCY

What I learned at the dream

clinic, that's what I'm trying

to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina,

and he didn't hang himself.

It's this guy -- he's after

us in our dreams.

MARGE

But that's just

not

reality,

Nancy!

120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120.

NANCY

It's

real

, Mamma.  Feel it.

MARGE

(horrified)

Put that damned thing down!

NANCY

His name is even in it -- written

right in here -- Fred Krueger --

Fred Krueger!  You know who that

is, Mamma?  You better tell me,

cause now he's after me!

MARGE

Nancy, trust your mother for

once -- you'll feel better as

soon as you sleep!

NANCY

You call this feeling better?

Or should I grab a bottle and

veg out with you -- avoid

everything happening to me

by just getting good and loaded --

MARGE

(losing it)

Fred Krueger can't be after you,

Nancy -- he's

dead

!

MARGE (CONTD)

(low, raw)

Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and

gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now

go to bed.  I order you, go to

bed.

NANCY

You

knew

about him all

this time, and you've been acting

like he was someone I made up!

MARGE

You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining

things.  You need to sleep,

it's as simple as that.

NANCY

Screw sleep!

MARGE (CONTD)

Nancy!

MARGE (CONTD)

Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!

NANCY

That's

enough

!

GLEN

Whenever I get nervous I eat.

NANCY

And if you can't do that, you

sleep.

GLEN

Used to.  Not anymore.

GLEN (CONTD)

You ever read about the Balinese

way of dreaming?

NANCY

No.

GLEN

They got a whole system they

call 'dream skills'.  So, if

you have a nightmare, for

instance like falling, right?

NANCY

Yeah.

GLEN

Instead of screaming and getting

nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna

make up my mind that I fall

into a magic world where I can

get something special, like a

poem or song.

(grins hopefully)

They get all their art literature

from dreams.  Just wake up and

write it down.  Dreamskills.

NANCY

And what if they meet a monster

in their dream?  Then what?

GLEN

They turn their back on it.

(grins hopefully)

Takes away its energy, and

it disappears.

NANCY

What happens if they don't do

that?

GLEN

(shrugs)

I guess those people don't

wake up to tell what happens.

NANCY

Great.

GLEN

'Booby Traps and Improvised

Anti-personel Devices'!

NANCY

I found it at this neat

survivalist bookstore on

Ventura.

GLEN

(shocked)

Well what

you

reading it for?

NANCY

I'm into survival.

GLEN

She's starting to scare the

living shit out of me.

FOREMAN

And the other...

MARGE

Where's your mask and gun?

FOREMAN

Don't bust my chops, lady.

If the city found out I put

'em in without inside releases

I'd loose my license.

NANCY

Oh gross...

123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123.

Every single window has been covered with brand-new

ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames

NANCY (OS)

Mom, what's with the bars!?

125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125.

NANCY

Oh, Mom...

MARGE

'S'mine...

NANCY

What's with the bars?

MARGE

S'curity.

NANCY

Mom, I want to know what you

know about Fred Krueger.

MARGE

Dead and gone.

NANCY

I want to know how, where --

if you don't tell me, I'm going

to call daddy.

MARGE (CONTD)

Your father the cop.  That's a

good one.

(colder)

Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't

want to know, believe me.

NANCY

I

do

want to know.  He's

not

dead and gone -- he's

after

me

and if I sleep he'll get me!

I've got to know!

MARGE

All right.

126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126.

MARGE

You want to know who Fred

Krueger was?  He was a filthy

child killer who got at least

twenty kids, kids from our

area, kids we all knew.  It

drove us all crazy when we

didn't know who was doing it --

but it was even worse when

they caught him.

MARGE (CONTD)

Oh lawyers got fat and the judge

got famous, but someone forgot to

sign the search warrant in the

right place, and Fred Krueger

was free, just like that.

NANCY

So he's alive?

MARGE

He wouldn've stopped.  The

bastard would've got more

kids first chance he got --

they found nearly ten bodies

in his boiler room as it

was.  But the law couldn't

touch him.

MARGE (CONTD)

What was needed were some private

citizens willing to do what had

to be

done

.

NANCY

(hushed)

What did you do, mother?

MARGE

Bunch of us parents tracked him

down after they let him go.  Found

him in an old boiler room, just

like before.  Saw him lying there

in that caked red and yellow sweater

he always wore, drunk an' asleep

with his weird knives by his side...

NANCY

(dreading it)

Go on...

MARGE

We poured gasoline all around

the place, left a trail out the

door, locked the door, then...

MARGE (CONTD)

WHOOSH!!!

MARGE (CONTD)

(hushed, remembering)

But just when it seemed not

even the devil could live

in there any more -- he crashed

out like a banshee, all on fire

-- swinging those fingerknives

every which direction and

screaming he... he was going

to get us by killing all our

kids...

MARGE (CONTD)

There were all those men, Nancy,

even your father, oh yes, even

him.  But none could do what

had to be done -- Krueger rolling

and screaming so loud the whole

state could hear -- no one could

take your father's gun and kill

him good and proper except

me

.

MARGE (CONTD)

So he's dead Nan.  He can't

get you.  Mommy killed him.

For someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,

NANCY

Who was there?  Were Tina's

parents there?  Were Rod's?

MARGE

Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.

But that's in the past now,

baby.  Really.  It's over.

(slyly)

We even took his knives.

MARGE (CONTD)

See?

NANCY

All these years you've kept those

things buried down here?  In our

own house?

MARGE (CONTD)

Proof he's declawed.  As for him,

we buried him good and deep.

MARGE (CONTD)

So's okay, you can sleep.

GLEN

Hello?

NANCY (telephone)

Hi.

GLEN

Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?

NANCY (CONTD)

Fine.  Stand by your window

so I can see you.  You sound

a million miles away.

NANCY (CONTD)

Much better.

GLEN

I heard your ma went ape at the

security store today.  You look

like the Prisoner of Zenda or

something.  How long's it been

since you slept?

NANCY

Coming up on the seventh day.  It's

okay, I checked Guiness.  The

record's eleven, and I'll beat

that if I have to.

(beat)

Listen, I... I know who he is.

GLEN

Who?

NANCY

The killer.

GLEN

You do?

NANCY

Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm

pretty sure you're next.

GLEN

Me!?  Why would anyone want to

kill me?!

NANCY

Don't ask -- just give me some

help nailing this guy when I

bring him out.

GLEN

Bring him out of what?

NANCY

My dream.

GLEN

How you plan to do that?

NANCY

Just like I did the hat.  Have

a hold of the sucker when you

wake me up.

GLEN

Me?

(switching back to a more

comfortable reality)

Wait a minute, you can't bring

someone out of a dream!

NANCY

If I can't, then you all can

relax, because it'll just be a

simple case of me being nuts.

GLEN

I can save you the trouble.

You're nutty as a fruitcake.

I love you anyway.

NANCY

Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking

this guy when I bring him out.

GLEN

What

!?

NANCY

(simplicity itself)

You heard me.  I grab him in the

dream -- you see me struggling

so you wake me up.  We both come

out, you cold cock the fucker,

and we got him.  Clever, huh?

GLEN

You crazy?  Hit him with what?

NANCY

You're a jock.  You must have

a baseball bat or something.

Come to my window at midnight.

And meanwhile...

GLEN

(weakly)

Meanwhile..?

NANCY

Meanwhile whatever you do

don't fall asleep.  Midnight.

GLEN

Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball

bats and boogemen.  Unfucking

real.

MRS LANTZ

Well how you gonna hear what

she says?

GLEN

Who cares what she says?

MRS LANTZ

You should get to sleep soon,

Glen.  It's almost midnight.

MRS LANTZ

Shouldn't say such a thing about

Hello Nancy.

Hi daddy.  I know what happened.

LT THOMPSON

Then you know more than I do --

I haven't even been upstairs.

NANCY

(guessing)

You know he's dead though, right?

LT THOMPSON

Yeah, apparantly he's dead.

How the hell'd you know?

NANCY

I've got a proposition for

you.  Listen very carefully,

please.

LT THOMPSON

Nan, I --

NANCY

Please.  I'm gonna go get

the guy who did it and bring

him to you.  I just need you

be right there to arrest him.

Okay?

LT THOMPSON

Just tell me who did it and

I'll go get him, baby.

NANCY

Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,

and only I can get him.  It's

my nightmare he comes to.

NANCY

-- I want you to come over here

and break the door down exactly

twenty minutes from now -- can

you do that?

LT THOMPSON

Sure, but...

NANCY

That'll be exactly half past

midnight.  Time for me to fall

asleep and find him.

LT THOMPSON

Sure, sure, honey.  You just

do that -- get yourself some

sleep -- that's what I've been

saying all along.

NANCY

And you'll be here to catch

him, right?

PARKER

Lieutenant -- they're waiting

upstairs.

LT THOMPSON

Sure, okay, I'll be there.

Now you just turn in and get

some rest, sweetheart.  Please.

Deal?

Deal.

Get outside and watch her house.

If you see anything funny call

me.

LT THOMPSON

I know it's hard to think at

a time like this, Walter, but

can you think of anyone who

could've done such a thing?

MR LANTZ

He done it.

LT THOMPSON

Who?  Who did that?

MR LANTZ

Krueger.

LT THOMPSON

Krueger?

MR LANTZ

Had to've done it.  No one

else was in there.

LT THOMPSON

How you know that?

MR LANTZ

Cause I thought Glen was

gonna sneak out to see your

lunatic daughter, that's why.

So I locked him in his room!

(getting control)

Sorry.  Anyways, the door was

still locked when we heard the

screams.

MR LANTZ (CONTD)

Maybe god's punishing us all...

LT THOMPSON

Keep your head -- this is a

fucking flesh and blood killer
