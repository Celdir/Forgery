HARVEY

(faintly)

Joyce... Joyce?

JOYCE

What's wrong, Harvey? What are you

doing up?

JOYCE

What is it?

HARVEY

(delirious, out of

breath)

Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who

writes about himself in a comic book?

Or am I just -- am I just a character

in that book?

JOYCE

Harvey...

HARVEY

If I die, will 'dat character keep

goin'? Or will he just fade away...

JOYCE

Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!

FADE TO BLACK:

BOYS

(in unison)

Trick or treat!!

HOUSEWIFE

Well, look at this! All the

superheroes on the porch! Ain't that

cute.

HOUSEWIFE

(still yelling)

We got Superman here, Batman, his

sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern

even...

HOUSEWIFE

And what about you young man?

KID

What about what?

HOUSEWIFE

Who are you supposed to be?

KID

I'm Harvey Pekar (pronounced "Pee

Car").

HOUSEWIFE

Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound

like a super hero to me...

BOYS

(mumbling)

Pecker, Pecker...

KID

I ain't no super hero, lady. I'm

just a kid from the neighborhood,

alright?

KID

Ahh, forget this...

KID

Why is everybody so stoopid?

DISSOLVE TO:

FROM OFF THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND COMES...

AMERICAN SPLENDOR

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya

here, so lemme step in an' help ya

catch up. This is the story about

comic books, an' a guy who made a

whole life outta them. You could

even say comics saved his life. This

guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar --

all grown up and goin' nowhere.

Although he's a pretty scholarly

cat, he never got much of a formal

education. For the most part, he's

lived in shit neighborhoods, held

shit jobs, and is now knee deep into

a second disastrous marriage. So if

yer lookin' for romance or escapism

or some fantasy figure to save the

day, guess what? Ya got the wrong

movie.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's

dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She

says I'm a social embarrassment. Now

that she's got her PhD, she's some

hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin'

but a file clerk with nothin' ta say

an' no voice ta say it. But me bein'

a file clerk was fine when I wrote

the damn check for her tuition --

DOCTOR #1

Harvey, stop talking please, and

open wide.

HARVEY

I just don't get it... We were doin'

okay for a while. Then we took that

stupid belated honeymoon. I started

losin' my voice on the plane. Can

you believe that... On the plane,

doc?

DOCTOR #1

Bad timing, I guess. Now please say

"Ah," Mr. Pekar.

HARVEY

"Ahhh."

(without missing a

beat)

"Ahhh" ruined the trip. I got crazy,

started to worry my voice would never

come back. I mean, my wife didn't

know me so long before we got hitched.

What if she totally forgets what I'm

like? Man, it's torture --

DOCTOR #1

Shhh...

DOCTOR #1

Uh-huh.

HARVEY

(the penlight in his

mouth)

What? Is it bad, doc?

DOCTOR #1

It's not good.

HARVEY

It's cancer? First I got marital

problems and now yer tellin' me I

got throat cancer? Omigod...

DOCTOR #1

Harvey, calm down. It's not cancer.

You have a nodule on your vocal

chords. Probably from screaming and

yelling too much. And if you don't

stop talking and give it a rest,

you're gonna lose your voice

completely.

HARVEY

Whew... Okay, okay. But fer how long?

DOCTOR #1

A few months.

HARVEY

(loudly)

Months!!

DOCTOR #1

See? More of that and you'll do

permanent damage. Now go home, keep

your mouth shut, and hopefully we

won't have to operate.

CUT TO:

TOBY

Hi Harvey. You weren't in work today.

Are you okay, Harvey?

TOBY

(yelling after him)

I'm heading downtown to the White

Castle. Wanna come, Harvey?

SPANISH WOMAN #1

(in Spanish)

I already told you, I'm waiting for

a call!

SPANISH WOMAN #2

Oh yeah? Since when is this your

private office?!

SPANISH WOMAN #1

Since you can kiss my ass.

HARVEY

(to himself)

Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do

it?

WOMAN #2

(yelling at Harvey)

Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!

HARVEY

(shaking his head)

They all make it seem so easy.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Here's our man walking home from the

doctor's. He's got the weight of the

world on him. And fer what, really?

'Cause his throat's a little screwy?

Man, people in India are starvin' to

death every day. His problems are

nothin'.

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid,

like some supernatural force is

conspiring against him to rob him of

his voice.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Maybe his old lady will go easy on

him today, when she sees how upset

he is.

HARVEY

(whispering)

Ay... What is this?

LANA

Exactly what it looks like.

HARVEY

(loud)

Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin'

me?! Fer what?

(his voice really

rips)

Ah, shit!

LANA

Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't

working for me anymore. Cleveland's

not working for me anymore. I gotta

get out of here before I kill myself.

HARVEY

But --

HARVEY

(mouthing, just a

wheeze)

Please! Wait, honey... Just listen

to what I got to say...

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Here's our man -- yeah alright, here's

me -- or the guy playin' me, anyway,

though he don't look nothin' like

me, but whatever. So it's a few months

later an' I'm workin' my flunky,

file-clerk gig at the V.A. Hospital.

My voice still ain't back yet. Things

seem like they can't get any worse...

NURSE

Thank you, Harvey dear.

HARVEY

(to himself)

Plebeian... where the hell did she

get that shit?

CUT TO:

MR. BOATS (O.S.)

Avoid the reeking herd! Shun the

polluted flock! Live like that stoic

bird, The eagle of the rock!

HARVEY

Huh? Oh. Hiya, Mr. Boats.

BOATS

You know what that means, son?

HARVEY

Yeah. It's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie

poem. It means stay away from the

crowds of common ordinary people an'

do yer own thing.

BOATS

Nope, it means don't compromise

yourself for women. Ain't gonna do

you no good! Get away from 'em as

soon as you can!

HARVEY

Well I ain't got no woman now. So

I'm living like the stoic bird, man.

MR. BOATS

The only way to live, son.

MR. BOATS

Look at that fool over there. What's

he wearing?

HARVEY

Huh? That's an A.M.-F.M. radio he's

listening to... They got 'em fixed

up now like a pair of earmuffs.

MR. BOATS

(inappropriately

angered)

MMPH! Isn't that somethin! People

have gone crazy. They'll buy any

kinda junk! Probably listening to

that loud rock stuff. Junk, junk,

it's all junk!

HARVEY

Well, I don't know. Rock music's got

some good qualities. I mean it ain't

jazz or nothin'.

MR. BOATS

Say, when you gonna bring me in some

good records? Some Nat "King" Cole

with Strings...

HARVEY

I don't got any of that, Mr. Boats...

MR. BOATS

Yeah, you got it... You're keepin'

it at home, though! You won't turn

loose the good stuff... You just

sell the junk!

MR. BOATS

(singing)

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa. Men have named

you.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

In the early sixties I was with some

buddies at a junk sale looking for

some choice sides when I met this

shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia

named Bob Crumb. You know the guy;

Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all --

they made a movie about him, too.

MARTY

C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann.

You gonna buy that or what?

HARVEY

I don't know, Marty. It's got a

lamination crack in it...

(checking out the

price)

A quarter. Maybe I can get him down.

MARTY

You are one cheap bastard Harvey.

HARVEY

Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I

live on a government wage.

CRUMB

You collect Jay McShann, man?

HARVEY

Yeah, man. How 'bout you?

CRUMB

Yeah but most of my records are back

in Philly.

PAHLS

Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He

just moved to town. He's an artist

at American Greeting Card Company.

HARVEY

That's cool.

PAHLS

You should see his comics, Harv.

They are outta sight.

HARVEY

(interested)

Yeah? I'm into comics myself.

DISSOLVE TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

So Crumb showed me this comic book

novel he was working on -- THE BIG

YUM YUM BOOK. I'd never seen anything

like it.

HARVEY

It's terrific, man! I really dig

your work.

CRUMB

(holding up a vintage

comic)

This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt

Kelly... It's pretty rare.

HARVEY

Yeah? Can I get good bread for it?

CRUMB

Nah! Not yet.

HARVEY

Listen man, let's get back to your

book. What are you gonna do with it?

CRUMB

(looking up)

I hadn't thought about it. It's just

an exercise.

HARVEY

It's more than an exercise. It's

breaking ground, man. There's some

wild shit in here.

CRUMB

You're spitting on me, Harvey.

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Crumb and I hung out a lot back then.

We had records and comics in common.

CRUMB

(laughing)

Check it out, man. Pretty scary.

HARVEY

Yeah, ya don't know the half of it.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Eventually people got hip to Crumb's

art work and he started hangin' out

with a Bohemian crowd. After a while,

he got sick of greeting cards and

moved away to San Francisco where he

got the whole underground comic scene

off the ground.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

He'd come back ta Cleveland every

few years, an' people'd treat him

like a celebrity.

DISSOLVE TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Once he came to visit when I was

really feelin' bad. It was right

around the time of my throat

operation, an' right after my second

wife left me. At first it was pretty

weird. I mean, here my life was

falling apart an' everything was

going great for him. I was on my

second divorce an' he was a big hit

with the chicks. I was a nothin'

file clerk and he was this famous

cartoonist.

HARVEY

I dunno, man. On the one hand most

women gettin' graduate degrees

wouldn't give a guy like me the time

a' day. An' she married me an'

everything, so I gotta give her some

kinda credit. But then she got so

mean to me in the end. An' it ain't

like I tried t'keep her captive or

anything like that, y'know?

HARVEY

An' then on top of it I lost my voice

for three months. I still sound like

shit, but before I had nothin'. Man,

talk about hell. I started forgettin'

what I sound like, y'know? So I

started writin' stuff down -- stories

an' things, my points a' view, ideas.

I even published a couple jazz record

reviews. I guess that ended up bein'

a good thing.

CRUMB

Uh-huh.

HARVEY

But don't think I buy into this

"growth" crap. Everybody talks about

how bad experiences can cause ya

t'grow, an' all that cliched stuff.

I've had enough bad experiences and

growth to last me plenty.

(a beat)

Right now, I'd be glad to trade some

growth for happiness.

HARVEY

So how long are ya stayin' in

Cleveland?

CRUMB

I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this

chick in New York. And I'm really

busy with the comic book stuff. It's

good bread and all man but I'm getting

fed up with the whole scene.

HARVEY

What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin'

a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh.

How many guys get that lucky in their

life, huh?

CRUMB

Yeah, I dunno.

HARVEY

Ya know man, people are startin' to

know the name "Crumb." When you croak

you're gonna leave something behind.

CRUMB

Yeah, my ashes and some crappy

doodles. It's not like I'm Blind

Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton.

HARVEY

C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a

gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky

and sellin' records on the side for

a buck.

CRUMB

Yeah, well that's true...

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Damn it!

CUT TO:

HARVEY

I'm starvin'.

CUT TO:

OLD JEWISH LADY

(Yiddish Accent)

Listen, goily, dese glasses are six

for $2.00 because I couldn't carry

twelf... But I vanted twelf so today

I'm buying six more... But you should

only charge me $1.50 for dem... It's

ok, you can esk de meneger.

CASHIER

(yelling)

Frank! I need a price check.

CARTOON HARVEY

Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue

forever with a cashier about anything.

Get behind them in a line an' yer

gonna wait forever!

CARTOON HARVEY

I mean, I'm a yid myself, an' the

women in my family are like that...

But I never got used to it... I may

be cheap, but I got limits!

OLD JEWISH LADY

Please. Let me 'splain von more time.

CARTOON HARVEY

Wake up! You're whole life's gettin'

eaten away by this kinda crap! What

kind of existence is this? Is this

all a workin' stiff like you can

expect? Ya gonna suffer in silence

fer the rest a' yer life?! Or ya

gonna make a mark. Huh? Huh?

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

HARVEY

Shit. Work.

MATTRESS GUY #1

So how smart is she?

MATTRESS GUY #2

I dunno. I guess she's about average.

MATTRESS GUY #1

Average? Hey, man. Average is dumb!

CUT TO:

HARVEY

See, ever since I read your stuff,

man I've been thinking I could write

comic book stories that were different

from anything being done.

CRUMB

(munching on a fry)

Uh-huh.

HARVEY

I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal

comics and super-hero stuff are really

limited 'cause they gotta try to

appeal to kids. And underground comics

like yours have been really subversive

or opened things up politically. But

there is still plenty more ta be

done with 'em, too, y'know?

CRUMB

Pass me the ketchup?

HARVEY

I mean with pictures and words, it

could be more of an art form. Like

those French movies are. Or De Sica

over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried

writin' some things about real life.

Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with.

CRUMB

These are about you.

HARVEY

Er, yeah...

CRUMB

You turned yourself into a comic

hero?

HARVEY

Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit.

No phony bullshit. The real thing,

y'know? Ordinary life is pretty

complex stuff.

CRUMB

These are really good, Harv.

HARVEY

(insecure)

Really? Ya think so?

CRUMB

Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I

dig it. Can I take them home and

illustrate them?

HARVEY

Wow!!

HARVEY

You'd do that for me, man? That'd be

great! I can't draw a straight line!

CRUMB

Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv?

All of a sudden it sounds fine.

HARVEY

(thrilled)

I don't know, man! I guess you cured

me!

DISSOLVE TO:

HARVEY

(beaming)

See that? All stories by yours truly.

WW II VET PATIENT

Hot off the presses, huh? We got a

regular Hemingway here.

HARVEY

No way, Jack, I don't go in for that

macho crap.

DOCTOR #3

I didn't know you could draw, Pekar.

HARVEY

Nah! I don't draw. I just write the

stories. A buddy of mine and some of

his friends do the art work.

TOBY

Harvey, am I in here? You promised I

would be in here.

HARVEY

Yeah! Yeah! You're in there, alright?

Jeez, Toby.

MR. BOATS

Let me see this.

TOBY

Mr. Boats, it's not polite to grab

things. Next time --

MR. BOATS

Son, you done good. Ya know, I was

up in Toronto a few weeks back an' I

saw the Red Chinese Ballet...

MR. BOATS

Now that was beautiful. The way those

people were dancing together. Those

Chinese work hard. I tell ya, they

work hard -- Where is everybody goin'?

MR. BOATS

Where these sickly men rushin' off

to? They ain't goin' nowhere for

now. Maybe not for a long time. But

damn if they ain't in a rush to get

there.

CUT TO:

MARTY

Hey look guys, here comes Captain

America.

PAHLS

(yelling out)

You gonna hang with the boys now

that yer a comic book star?

HARVEY

Cut it out. Man, I ain't nothin' yet

compared to Bob Crumb.

GUY #3

Ah, listen to him. One lousy comic

book and he wants to be Crumb.

PAHLS

Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics

for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty

stuff in it.

GUY #3

Yeah, you can write about Marty's

sex life.

GUY #3

Right Marty? I heard ya went out

with Bonnie yesterday.

PAHLS

Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her?

MARTY

Ah, lousy. All's I got wuz armaround.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Here's our man eight comics later, a

brand new decade, same old bullshit.

Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition

for his writin' now. Sure his comics

are praised by all the important

media types tellin' people what to

think. But so what?  It's not like

he makes a livin' at it like Bob

Crumb. He can't go an' quit his day

job or nothin'.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Who am I kiddin'. Truth is I'd be

lost without my work routine.

FLASH CUT TO:

HARVEY

(calming himself down)

I got a job... I got a job...

BACK TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

So -- to stave off desperation and

feelings of uselessness -- I resigned

myself to a menial existence. But

hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy

life feels worse just before he dies

than th' guy who had a sad one. Or,

maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just

needed a woman.

TOBY

Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet

jelly beans? I gave up sweets for

lent.

HARVEY

Huh? Sure, I'll take 'em.

HARVEY

Hey, watermelon. That's pretty good.

TOBY

I recommend the pina coladas. They

are excellent and very authentic

tasting.

HARVEY

Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during

lent?

TOBY

Sure. I don't see why not. You can't

eat meat on certain days, but lentils

should be acceptable anytime.

HARVEY

Ya think there's any connection

between lentils and lent?

TOBY

I don't think so but I'll ask Sister

Mary Fred at church on Sunday.

HARVEY

Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute?

Sounds kinda mannish but who am I to

be picky.

TOBY

Harvey, you're funny. She's a nun.

HARVEY

So what? Maybe she became a nun

because she couldn't get a guy.

TOBY

Harvey, she became a nun because she

had a higher calling.

HARVEY

Higher calling. That is such a crock

of shit. I don't know why you waste

your time prayin' anyway.

TOBY

Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And

I'm a very spiritual person. You

know, you should try believing in

something bigger than yourself. It

might cheer you up.

HARVEY

(calling after him)

What? Do I seem depressed, Toby?

BOB THE DIRECTOR (V.O.)

Cut!

CUT TO:

BOB THE DIRECTOR

Okay, that was great. The bakery

scene is next...

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

My loneliness was unbearable, man.

Weekends were the worst. Sometimes

in my sleep, I'd feel a body next to

me like an amputee feels a phantom

limb.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Sure my comics were bringin' me

notoriety, but my personal life was

in shambles. I thought a little

attention would make me feel better.

It only made me feel worse.

CUT TO:

COUNTER GIRL #1

(yelling to Harvey)

Next!

HARVEY

(to the Counter Girl)

Yeah! I'll have two crullers, a jelly

donut with powdered sugar... And you

got any "day old bread"?

ALICE

Hey, you're Harvey Pekar.

HARVEY

Yeah...

ALICE

Alice Quinn. From school.

HARVEY

Oh yeah. College. We had a couple

lit classes together.

ALICE

What happened to you? You just

disappeared after one semester.

HARVEY

I know, man. I got good grades and

all but there was this required math

class. I can't do math, an' that

required class hangin' over my head

made me crazy. Eventually the pressure

got to be too much.

ALICE

Well, you're doing okay anyway. I

heard all about your jazz reviews

and your comics.

HARVEY

Ya did?

ALICE

Sure, you're famous. Meanwhile I got

my degree but I'm just a plain old

wife and mother.

HARVEY

Yeah. I'm not doing as great as ya

think. My second wife divorced me

and I work at a dead end job as a

file clerk. Sometimes I hang out

with the guys on the corner but most

of the time I just stay home by myself

and read.

ALICE

You're luckier than you think. My

husband and kids make it impossible

for me to cuddle up with a good book.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

I'm reading this book by Dreiser now --

JENNIE GERHARDT.

ALICE

That's one of my favorites.

HARVEY

I hope it don't end like so many a'

those naturalist novels... With

someone getting crushed ta earth by

forces he can't control.

ALICE

I think you'll be pleasantly

surprised. It's certainly not a

Hollywood happy ending, but it's

pretty truthful. Which is rare these

days...

ALICE

This is me.

HARVEY

Nice car. I don't have one yet.

ALICE

Can I give ya a lift somewhere?

HARVEY

Nah. It's a nice day. I'll just walk.

ALICE

Well, we should have you over sometime

for dinner.

HARVEY

Sure, I'd be glad t'come. But if you

really wanna do me a favor, introduce

me to some a' your single girlfriends.

I bet they're all smart like you.

I'm no catch, though, so I'll take

anything you can get me.

ALICE

I'll work on it.

ALICE

Nice seeing ya Harvey.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

When I got home, I finished reading

JENNIE GERHARDT. It was real good,

way better than I expected. That

Alice wuz right.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Sure Lester -- the main character --

croaks in the end, but at least he's

old and dies a natural dignified

death.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I was more alone that weekend than

any. All I did was think about JENNIE

GERHARDT an' Alice Quinn an' all the

decades of people I have known.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

The more I thought, the more I felt

like cryin'; Life seemed so sweet

an' so sad an' so hard t'let go of

in the end.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

But hey, man. Every day's a brand

new deal, right? Just keep on workin'

and sump'n's bound ta turn up.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

What happened to the new American

Splendor?

RAND

We sold 'em, babe.

JOYCE

All of them?

RAND

Yep.

JOYCE

(accusatory)

Damn it! I put one aside for myself,

next to the register. I didn't even

get a chance to read it.

RAND

Whoa, sorry, Joyce. I didn't know

you were such a Splendor fan. Next

time take it home.

JOYCE

Maybe I'll call the publisher. But

they take so damn long. Shit! Why

does everything in my life have to

be such a complicated disaster...

RAND

Okay, I'm gonna hustle before the

vibe in here gets any worse.

CUT TO:

JOYCE (V.O.)

Greetings from the second smallest

state in the union, an endless

plastics and nylon plantation

controlled by giant chemical

corporations.

CUT TO:

JOYCE (V.O.)

To make matters more dismal, there

are no decent comic book stores in

my town, which is why my partner and

I opened one ourselves.

JOYCE (V.O.)

Despite our steadily faltering

business, my partner managed to sell

the last copy of American Splendor

#8 out from under me. I'm a big fan

and I hate to wait for a new order.

Is there any way I can get it from

you direct? Sincerely, Joyce Brabner.

HARVEY

...man, she's got good lookin'

handwritin'...

HARVEY

Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter.

Whattya do besides sellin' comics?

JOYCE (V.O.)

I'm a sometime activist and I teach

writing to prisoners. I try to help

them build an interior life and make

art out of their monotonous,

suffocating routine.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Sounds familiar. So you married or

what?

JOYCE (V.O.)

I'm divorced, thank god.

HARVEY

Look, I think you an' I got a lot in

common. How am I gonna get you to

come visit me in Cleveland?

JOYCE (V.O.)

Cleveland? You think that's a good

idea?

HARVEY

It's a great idea. You should meet

me, 'cause I'm a great guy. Despite

the way my comics read, I got a lot

of redeeming characteristics.

JOYCE

I don't know. Where would I stay?

HARVEY (V.O.)

With me. Don't worry, I'm not gonna

put no moves on you or anything.

JOYCE

I'm not worried about that...

(fumbling with a tea

cup)

Hold on, I just spilled chamomile

tea all over my bathrobe.

HARVEY (V.O.)

So what are ya worried about then?

JOYCE

(sipping)

Well, the way all those different

artists draw you, I don't quite know

what to expect. I mean sometimes you

look like a younger Brando, but then

the way Crumb draws you -- like a

hairy ape with all those stinky,

wavy lines radiating off your body --

it's kind of scary.

HARVEY (V.O.)

Those are motion lines. I'm an active

guy. Anyway, just come out here an'

I'll try to be anyone you want me ta

be.

JOYCE

That's a dangerous offer. I'm a

notorious reformer...

CUT TO:

HARVEY (O.S.)

Hey. Are you Joyce?

JOYCE

Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person.

HARVEY

Hiya. Look, before we get started

with any of this, ya might as well

know right off the bat. I had a

vasectomy.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

What's wrong?

JOYCE

Nothing.

HARVEY

Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around

everywhere.

JOYCE

I guess I never imagined you eating

in a place like this.

HARVEY

Me? I never been here. I thought

you'd like it. But obviously ya don't,

do ya?

JOYCE

It's fine. What difference does it

make?

HARVEY

I dunno. None, I guess.

(beat)

They sure got a lot of meat on this

menu.

JOYCE

You're a vegetarian?

HARVEY

Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet

cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore.

JOYCE

Hmm. I support and identify with

groups like PETA, but unfortunately

I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I

have all these food allergies to

vegetables that give me serious

intestinal distress. I guess I have

a lot of borderline health disorders

that limit me politically when it

comes to eating.

HARVEY

Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh?

JOYCE

Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone

in my family's got some kind of

degenerative illness.

WAITRESS

(sing song)

Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy!

What can I bring you two today?

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Look, I was gonna clean up, but why

should I give you any false notions?

The truth is I got a serious problem

with cleanliness. I could wash a

dish ten times and it'd still dirty.

They even kicked me outta the Army

'cause I couldn't learn ta make a

bed.

JOYCE

I've seen worse.

JOYCE

Harvey, go get me water and a few

aspirin.

HARVEY

What, ya got a headache?

JOYCE

No, but I want to avoid one.

HARVEY

Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is

nice ta have company. I mean, despite

all your problems, you seem like a

great person. An' hey, sorry if my

dating skills are kinda rusty, but

I've just been through hell and back

with women. I mean that last one

turned out to be a real nasty bitch.

JOYCE

I had a nice time with you, too.

HARVEY

Yeah? You had a nice time?

JOYCE

Don't make people repeat themselves.

It's annoying.

HARVEY

Oh, sorry.

JOYCE

C'mere...

JOYCE

Harvey?

HARVEY

Yeah?

JOYCE

Which door's the bathroom?

HARVEY

Hey, Joyce! What's wrong? What is

it?

CUT TO:

JOYCE

Ugh! I don't know. I think that yuppie

food did me in.

BACK TO:

HARVEY

I feel terrible. Lemme at least do

something for you.

BACK TO:

HARVEY

Can I make ya something? How about

some chamomile tea?

JOYCE

Chamomile tea? What the hell's a guy

like you doing with that? I thought

you drink soda pop for breakfast.

HARVEY (O.S.)

I dunno. I noticed you drank a lot

of it when we started talkin' on the

phone. So I stocked up on herbal

teas for your visit.

BACK TO:

HARVEY

The girl at the Food Co-op picked me

out all kinds of herbal stuff. One

of 'ems good for stomachaches. Grandma

Bear's Tummy Mint, I think. Are you

still there?

JOYCE

Harvey, we better skip this whole

courtship thing and just get married.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Man, am I glad I talked you into

comin' up here. Any more time alone

and I mighta lost it fer good.

JOYCE

Me too.

HARVEY

So you don't have any problems with

movin' to Cleveland?

JOYCE

Not really. I find most American

cities depressing in the same way.

HARVEY

An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing?

HARVEY

Ay Toby.

TOBY

(mouth full)

No you can't have any of my White

Castle hamburgers so please don't

even ask.

HARVEY

Can I have a fry?

TOBY

Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm

not going to eat dinner until very

late and this has got to hold me

over.

HARVEY

(munching)

Whattya got, a church function?

TOBY

No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a

movie. Would you like to come?

HARVEY

Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight.

I'm gettin' married.

TOBY

Oh. Why Delaware?

HARVEY

The chick I'm marryin' is from

Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her

move her stuff here.

(a beat)

Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a

movie?

TOBY

It's not playing at the Mapletown.

(a beat)

I didn't know you had a girlfriend,

Harvey.

HARVEY

Yeah. We met last week.

HARVEY

Toby, what movie could possibly be

worth drivin' 260 miles round trip

for?

TOBY

It's a new film called "Revenge of

the Nerds." It's about a group of

nerd college students who are being

picked on all the time by the jocks,

so they decide to take revenge. I

already saw it once.

HARVEY

Wow, ya really dig this movie.

TOBY

I like it a lot, Harvey.

HARVEY

What are these nerds like? How would

you describe them?

TOBY

Hmm... Nerds are smart but they look

and act differently than other people.

Like nerds might wear polyester button-

down shirts and flood pants where

their ankles and their socks are

showing.

HARVEY

So what yer sayin' is you identify

with those nerds?

TOBY

(rubbing out the catsup)

Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And

this movie has uplifted me. There's

this one scene where a nerd grabs

the microphone during a pep rally

and announces that he is a nerd and

that he is proud of it and stands up

for the rights of other nerds. Then,

he asks the kids at the pep rally

who think they are nerds to come

forward... So nearly everyone in the

place does. That's the way the movie

ends.

HARVEY

So the nerds won, huh?

TOBY

(smiling)

Yes.

HARVEY

Wow. You got this movie an' I'm

gettin' hitched. We both had a good

month, huh?

TOBY

(finishing his last

burger)

Right. Harvey, how long are you going

to be in Delaware because I'd really

like to see this movie with you?

HARVEY

I'm only goin' for a week but then

I'll have a wife, so I'll have to

take her along. Is it a girl flick?

TOBY

Depends on the girl. What kind of

girl is your new bride? Is she a

nerd?

HARVEY

I don't know, man. Maybe. She's into

herbal teas.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

I agree with Toby. I think it's a

story of hope and tolerance.

TOBY

Yes. It's about time that the people

who get picked on get to be the

heroes.

HARVEY

It's an entertaining flick an' I can

see why you like it Toby, but those

people on the screen ain't even

supposed to be you! They're college

students whose parents live in big

houses in the suburbs. They're gonna

get degrees, get good jobs and stop

being nerds.

JOYCE

Harvey, what did I say about loud

talking? Use your inside voice.

HARVEY

(whispering loudly)

Look Toby, the guys in that movie

are not 28-year-old file clerks who

live with their grandmothers in an

ethnic ghetto.

JOYCE

That's enough, Harvey.

HARVEY

They didn't get their computers like

you did -- by trading in a bunch of

box tops and $49.50 at the

supermarket.

TOBY

You're funny Harvey.

HARVEY

Sure, Toby. Go to the movies and

daydream, but "Revenge of the Nerds"

ain't reality. It's just Hollywood

bullshit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Okay, maybe I was bein' so harsh on

Toby onna count a' my own problems.

REAL HARVEY

Y'see, I wasn't even married a month

and my old lady was already showin'

signs a' trouble. Granted, I tend ta

get married fast 'cause I'll take

any woman that'll have me, but this

time I really met my match...

CUT TO:

DIRECTOR

Okay, I think the thing with Joyce

is that as manic as Harvey can be,

she matches him with depression. In

that way they complete each other. I

mean, she's obviously a very smart

woman, but she has a lot of trouble

functioning in a world she can't

control. And she's totally obsessed

with all things negative; y'know,

diseases, dysfuctions, etc.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

What about these 78's, Harvey? Can't

you sell them to one of those

collectors?

HARVEY

Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't

getting rid of my 78's.

JOYCE

(angry)

Forget it then. I give up! How can I

make more storage space, if you won't

get rid of anything?

HARVEY

I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my

good stuff.

JOYCE

Everything's your good stuff. How am

I supposed to live here, if there's

no room for me?

HARVEY

Aw come on, baby. I'll make room for

ya. You just have to give me time.

I'm not so good at these kind of

things.

JOYCE

That's because you're obsessive

compulsive Harvey.

HARVEY

C'mon. I don't wanna hear that

psychobabble crap!

JOYCE

I don't care if you wanna hear it or

not. You're the poster child for the

DSM III. I'll have you know that I

come from a very dysfunctional family.

I can spot personality disorders a

mile away...

TOBY

Hello Joyce. Is Harvey home?

JOYCE

Borderline autistic!

JOYCE

Polymorphously Perverse.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

Paranoid Personality Disorder.

ANSWERING MACHINE

Please leave a message.

(Beep)

HARVEY

(into phone)

Hey Joyce, it's me. You're not gonna

believe this but some LA producer

called an' he wants to do a play

about my life. Call me!

(Click)

JOYCE

(to herself)

Delusions of grandeur.

CUT TO:

STAGE ACTOR HARVEY

See, I think comics can be an art

form. With pictures an' words, a guy

can do pretty much anything!

STAGE ACTOR JOYCE

That's true, Harvey. But I didn't

come all the way from Delaware to

talk about comics ...

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

If ya think readin' comics about yer

life seems strange, try watchin' a

play about it. God only knows how

I'll feel when I see this movie. But

truth be told, the play wasn't half

bad, and we got a free trip outta

it. Things were goin' pretty good

for a change. Variety called me "The

Blue Collar Mark Twain," and Doubleday

was interested in publishing an

anthology of "American Splendor."

CUT TO:

HARVEY

I hate checkin' bags, man. It always

takes forever.

HARVEY

Jesus, look at the time. The bus is

gonna leave soon and there won't be

another one for an hour. That means

I gotta shell out an extra thirty

bucks for a cab.

HARVEY

Hey wait, there's our --

(a well-dressed man

grabs it)

Figures. That lucky Yuppie's gonna

get on the bus in time.

JOYCE

Y'know Harvey, vasectomies are

reversible.

HARVEY

(ignoring her)

Damn Yuppies get everything.

JOYCE

(raising her voice)

Are you listening to me? I said

vasectomies are reversible.

HARVEY

What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't

want kids. An' I came clean about my

vasectomy the first time I set eyes

on ya', right here in this airport.

JOYCE

I know but things have changed. I

think we can be a family.

HARVEY

Family?! What kinda family could we

possibly be? I ain't no good with

kids. I can barely take care of

myself.

JOYCE

I'll take care of the kid and you.

HARVEY

(dead serious)

No way Joyce. Forget it. I can't do

it; I can't have no kids.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman

album, Joyce? I got a review due

tomorrow.

JOYCE

I didn't touch it, Harvey. Would you

let me sleep?

HARVEY

But it's one o'clock! How late can a

person sleep?

JOYCE

It happens to be Saturday you selfish

sonofabitch! And don't you go telling

me what to do. I'm the one who moved

into your city, into your home, into

your vasectomy and into your screwed-

up life. The least you could do is

allow me to live here my way.

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I tried everything but nothin' could

get this woman outta bed.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I mean she wouldn't get a job,

wouldn't go out, wouldn't make

friends, nothin'.

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Joyce diagnosed herself as "clinically

depressed." I don't know what the

hell she was goin' through but it

was sure takin' it's toll on me.

HARVEY

(upbeat)

We can go out for dinner tonight.

How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's?

JOYCE

(mumbling)

I'm not hungry.

HARVEY

I give up.

HARVEY

Hey Joyce, we got a message here.

Why didn't you pick up.

HARVEY

Useless.

MALE VOICE

Hi, this is a message for Harvey

Pekar. My name is Jonathan Greene

and I'm a producer for LATE NIGHT

WITH DAVID LETTERMAN. We'd like to

talk to you about coming on the show

to plug your comics. Please give me

a call at 212-555-3333.

HARVEY (O.S.)

What the hell?

MALE VOICE

Hi, this is a message for Harvey --

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Joyce finally got off the futon...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Aw, c'mon. Who the hell cares?

HARVEY

Hey, whattya doin?

JOYCE

Merchandising.

CUT TO:

JOYCE

People like this show?

HARVEY

I'm gettin' hungry back here. They

oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin'.

STAGE MANAGER

Dave's ready for you now, Mr. Pekar.

HARVEY

Hey, you got anything ta eat? My

stomach's growling.

STAGE MANAGER

(checking his watch)

There's no time to eat now.

LETTERMAN

Okay. Our next guest works as a file

clerk in a Cleveland hospital.

JOYCE

Wait a minute. Where's the doll?

HARVEY

He's got it at the desk. Will you

relax about that already?

STAGE MANAGER

Guys, guys, we're in a hurry here.

LETTERMAN

...He also writes comic books which

detail his day-to-day pains and

pleasures, and this is an anthology

of nine of those comics. It's entitled

AMERICAN SPLENDOR... From off the

streets of Cleveland, please say

hello to Harvey Pekar.

HARVEY

I'm ready for those Cleveland jokes.

Go ahead...

LETTERMAN

Alright settle down Harvey. Settle

down.

(the Audience laughs)

Now let's explain to folks who may

not be familiar with your work what

it is you do here, exactly. You have

comic books about you in your daily

life in Cleveland.

HARVEY

That's right.

LETTERMAN

And are they embellished at all or

is it pretty much factual?

HARVEY

(patronizing)

No. It's all true, David. All true.

LETTERMAN

And you also have a regular job in

Cleveland working at a hospital.

HARVEY

That's right. Aiding the sick, yes.

LETTERMAN

Aiding the sick. Well that's certainly

noble work.

HARVEY

Thank you. Thank you.

JOYCE

(unimpressed)

Such brilliant repartee...

BACK TO:

LETTERMAN

Now it seems to me Harvey that you

have a very successful career here.

This is being published by a major

publishing company, Doubleday. Why

do you maintain the day job?

HARVEY

(defensive)

To make a living!

(big laughs)

I don't make a living as a writer.

I've been writing for many years,

David. Maybe more years than you've

been alive.

BACK TO:

HARVEY

Yeah, I know that my youthful

appearance belies, you know, my actual

age. But, I've been around for a

long time --

LETTERMAN REGULAR

(to JOYCE)

You know this guy?

JOYCE

I'm beginning to wonder.

LETTERMAN

But I have a feeling though, if you

wanted to, you could probably get by

on what you make selling your work.

Because I know people are after you

to write other things. You're

publishing this anthology...

HARVEY

Who? What people? What people? What

are you talking about? Where the

hell do you get that stuff?

HARVEY

I'm no show biz phoney. I'm telling

the truth. Come on, man.

LETTERMAN REGULAR

(to Joyce)

At least he's keeping up with

Letterman.

JOYCE

Pandering is more like it.

JOYCE

Damnit.

LETTERMAN REGULAR

Excuse me, but what are you doing?

JOYCE

I'm trying to get some news. You

know there's a big story about to

break about the US selling arms to

Iran and the Contras.

LETTERMAN REGULAR

That's a monitor.

JOYCE

Ugh. Just forget it.

LETTERMAN

Harvey, I know you've got a job.

I've got a job. We're both very lucky.

We both have jobs.

HARVEY

Then what's the matter?

LETTERMAN

We've gotta go. Harvey I like you.

I'm on your side. I enjoy the comic

books. And here, quickly tell us

about the little doll here.

HARVEY

My wife made it.

JOYCE

Finally something good.

(to Letterman Regular)

Watch this.

LETTERMAN

They're made out of your old clothing.

HARVEY

That's right.

LETTERMAN

And what do these go for?

HARVEY

Thirty-four bucks.

LETTERMAN

(shocked)

Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four

dollars for this?

HARVEY

What are ya cheap. You cheaper than

me?

LETTERMAN

Would you pay thirty-four dollars

for that?

HARVEY

No but I'm not asking it. My wife

is.

BACK TO:

STAGE MANAGER

He's a natural.

LETTERMAN REGULAR

He is. Good stuff.

STAGE MANAGER

C'mon. Your turn.

HARVEY

Whad'ya think?

JOYCE

Megalomaniac.

DISSOLVE TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

It became clear pretty fast that I

was invited on the show just for

laughs. But what the hell did I care?

Letterman was an okay guy. Let him

take pot shots at me, s'long as I

got paid an' got to plug my comics.

CUT TO:

LETTERMAN

Harvey, you are the embodiment of

the American dream...

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Funny thing is, somethin' about me

and Letterman clicked for the viewers.

He kept wantin' me back.

LETTERMAN

It is my pleasure to welcome back

our next guest, the lovable Harvey

Pekar!

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Here was this slick, ambitious guy

with millions, winnin' over the

country by makin' light of everything.

And then there was me... A messy

loser with no dough who takes

everything too seriously.

LETTERMAN

Tell me Harvey, what do you do to

get away from the pressure of being --

well, a file clerk?

(laughter)

HARVEY

Go ahead and laugh, folks. But he

has more contempt for you than I do!

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

An it wasn't just me gettin' all the

attention. As a result of my

appearances on Letterman, my buddy

Toby Radloff landed a gig on MTV

extolling the virtues of White Castle

burgers...

MTV DIRECTOR

Christ! Watch where you're going!

HARVEY

(muttering)

Fuckin' yuppie or whatever kinda

freak you are.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

That day on the set with those MTV

jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed

that real, salt of the earth people

like Toby an' me were bein' coopted

by these huge corporations. We were

gettin' held up and ridiculed as

losers in the system.  What can I

say, it was the 80's man.

CUT TO:

TOBY

Hamburgers are a safer addiction

than drugs. Say no to drugs. Say yes

to White Castle!

CUT TO:

JOYCE

(looking up from the

paper)

Harvey, I've been reading about these

kids who grew up in war zones...

Palestinians, Israelis, El

Salvadorians, Cambodians... These

kids are amazing and they're --

YUPPIE

Hey, you're that guy from the

Letterman show, right?

HARVEY

(smiling)

Yeah, that's me.

YUPPIE

That's so excellent. You and Stupid

Pet Tricks are a riot.

HARVEY

Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my

comics, man. That's the only reason

I go on that dumb show anyway.

YUPPIE

Right, sure. Later, Harvey Pekar!

HARVEY

Asshole.

JOYCE

Anyway, I want to do a political

comic book about these kids. There's

a conference in Jerusalem in a few

weeks, and I can start by doing

interviews there.

HARVEY

Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem?

I can barely drag you off the futon

to go to the Letterman show.

JOYCE

Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a

damn about the Letterman show. I

want to work on something important

to me. Something that matters.

HARVEY

(furious)

Hey! You know I only go on the show

for the extra bread!

JOYCE

Harvey... you're yelling...

HARVEY

Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and

got a job, I could work on something

that matters, too, huh?!

HARVEY

I'm sorry, baby. I -- I'm sorry...

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I guess it was good ta finally see

Joyce excited about somethin' of her

own. Sure I was happy for her. But I

was still upset for me.

HARVEY

This is crazy. Can't ya just do

somethin' here in Cleveland?

JOYCE

Harvey, you'll survive a few weeks

alone.

HARVEY

Alright... Be careful. I love you,

baby.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

It was later that night when I first

found the lump.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I was determined to put it outta my

mind until Joyce got back. Easier

said than done.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

What do I care! Just gimme the chart

already!

MIGUEL

What is your problem today?!

HARVEY

Look, Miguel! I just don't wanna

keep comin' back here for it, okay?!

MIGUEL

Harvey, that patient's due t'be

admitted a week from now! Why do you

always have to be picking fights

with everybody?

HARVEY

(yelling)

How many times do we gotta go through

the same bullshit. Just gimme the

fuckin' chart!

MIGUEL

We'll see what the doctor says about

this.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARVEY

(loudly into phone)

Whadya mean? Another two weeks? Ya

gotta come home some time! Hello?

DAMNIT!

CUT TO:

LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.)

And there you have it, folks! Another

enlightening episode of Stupid Pet

Tricks!

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

I was startin' ta lose it. Between

the lump, the loneliness -- I felt

like everything wuz closin' in on

me. And with Joyce over there savin'

the world, I never felt more like a

sell-out hack in my life.

LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.)

Y'know ladies and gentlemen, when

Thoreau wrote that most men lead

lives of quiet depression, he

obviously had not met our first guest,

who happens to lead a life of whining

desperation...

HARVEY

(threatening)

Okay, asshole. You'll pay for that

one...

LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

back, Harvey Pekar.

DISSOLVE TO:

HARVEY (O.S.)

Hey, Dave! You wanna know what my

politics are? I'm a strident leftist,

Dave.

LETTERMAN (O.S.)

I could have guessed half of that.

HARVEY (O.S.)

You coulda guessed all of it, man!

So why don't we talk about your parent

company, G.E., huh? Let's talk about

anti-trust violations and nuclear

reactors!

STAGE MANAGER

Joe, put more sodas in the fridge,

there. And let's clean up the

counters. That Pekar guy's a pig.

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2

Whoa... you guys. Check this out.

HARVEY (O.S.)

You're a cop-out, Letterman. You're

nothin' but a shill for G.E.

LETTERMAN (O.S.)

First of all, Harvey, what you are

saying is not true. Second of all,

this is not the place to say it. If

you want to talk about this, go

somewhere else, because you're not

talking about it here!!

CUT TO:

HARVEY (O.S.)

Don't worry, Dave. I won't come back

unless you beg me.

LETTERMAN (O.S.)

You're not coming back at all.

HARVEY (O.S.)

What do I care --

LETTERMAN (O.S.)

Because we've given you many, many

chances to talk about things that

would be of general interest to people --

HARVEY (O.S.)

So what?!

LETTERMAN (V.O.)

-- And also to promote your little

Mickey Mouse magazine. Your little

weekly reader! But you've blown every

chance you've got. You're a dork,

Harvey!

HARVEY (V.O.)

Dave, you're fulla shit! You're fulla

shit!!

DISSOLVE TO:

JOYCE

I guess you did it this time.

HARVEY

Who cares. He wasn't helpin' my sales

anyway.

(moving closer)

Baby, don't go away anymore. I just

can't take bein' alone.

JOYCE

If you met those kids over there and

saw what they go through, you wouldn't

ask that of me.

HARVEY

But if you go again I'm really gonna

lose it.

JOYCE

It's not open for discussion, Harvey.

I need this in my life right now.

JOYCE

But I do appreciate the fact that

you missed me so much. C'mere...

JOYCE

Harvey, what is that?

CUT TO:

JOYCE

I don't understand, does "tumor"

mean the same thing as "cancer"?

CUT TO:

DOCTOR #2

...cat scan... diagnosis... MRI...

cancer... cancer... cancer...

HARVEY

How can I have cancer? I don't feel

sick at all.

JOYCE

That's a positive thing.

HARVEY

My cousin Norman died of lymphoma.

He was twenty-nine. He was a brilliant

oncologist.

JOYCE

Stop it! You're not going to die,

Harvey. You're not.

HARVEY

What's going to happen to you, baby?

Who's gonna take care of you if I'm

not around?

JOYCE

Harvey, look at me and focus. We are

going to get through this. I

understand illness. I know how to

handle these things.

HARVEY

But that's you. I'm not strong enough.

I don't know how ta be positive. I

can't do it. I can't.

JOYCE

Yes, you can. And I'll tell you how.

You'll make a comic book out of the

whole thing. You'll document every

little detail. And that way you'll

remove yourself from the experience

until it's over.

HARVEY

I can't do that. I'm just not strong

enough... I just wanna die.

JOYCE

Fine. I'll do it without you.

CUT TO:

FRED

Hey, I'm Fred. You called me about

the comic book?

JOYCE

Right -- the artist. Come on in.

FRED

This is my daughter, Danielle. I had

to bring her along. I hope you don't

mind.

JOYCE

Hi, Danielle. What's that you're

holding?

DANIELLE

A pony.

JOYCE

A pony? What's his name?

DANIELLE

She's a girl. Clarissa.

JOYCE

Oh, I see. Well, I'm Joyce. Nice to

meet both you and Clarissa.

FRED

I'm really sorry to hear about Harvey.

Is he here?

JOYCE

He's going to work until next week,

when he starts the chemo. That's why

I wanna get this project started

now. Once he's stuck here, I know

he'll take over.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Shit!

HARVEY

Damnit!

HARVEY

Joyce, open the door! I lost my keys

again! Joyce!!

HARVEY

Joyce!! Open the fucking door!!

FRED

Hey, Harvey.

HARVEY

Fred?

CUT TO:

FRED

Here are some ideas we batted around.

HARVEY

Sheesh. Joyce doesn't know what she's

doing. There's too many words in

these frames. When are ya comin'

back?

FRED

Uh, she said something about next

Tuesday, which is fine with me. Only

thing is, I might have the kid again.

My ex-wife's supposed to take her,

but I don't have much faith in her

showing up. She is in worse shape

than me these days.

HARVEY

Next week my treatment begins. Do me

a favor. Bring the kid with you.

HARVEY

(faintly)

Joyce... Joyce?

JOYCE

What's wrong, Harvey? What are you

doing up?

JOYCE

What is it?

HARVEY

(delirious, out of

breath)

Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who

writes about himself in a comic book?

Or am I just -- just a character in

that book?

JOYCE

Harvey...

HARVEY

When I die, will 'dat character keep

goin'? Or will he just fade away.

JOYCE

Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!

HARVEY

My name is Harvey Pekar. It's an

unusual name -- Harvey Pekar...

HARVEY

1960 was the year I got my first

apartment and my first telephone

book. Imagine my surprise when I

looked up my name and saw that, in

addition to me, another Harvey Pekar

was listed!

HARVEY

I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar...

My middle name is Lawrence... He was

listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle

initial... Therefore, his was a purer

listing.

HARVEY

Then, in the seventies, I noticed

that a third Harvey Pekar was listed

in the phone book! This filled me

with curiosity.

HARVEY

How could there be three people with

such an unusual name in the world,

let alone in one city?!

HARVEY

Then one day, a person I worked with

expressed her sympathy to me

concerning what she thought was the

death of my father. She pointed out

an obituary notice in the newspaper

for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of

his sons was named Harvey. These

were the other Harvey Pekars.

HARVEY

Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr.

died. Although I'd met neither man,

I was filled with sadness. "What

were they like," I thought. It seemed

that our lives had been linked in

some indefinable way.

HARVEY

But the story does not end there.

For two years later another Harvey

Pekar appeared in the directory.

What kind of people are these? Where

do they come from, what do they do?

What's in a name?

HARVEY

Who is Harvey Pekar?

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Here's our man a year later. Somehow

I made it through the treatments,

an' the doctors are optimistic. I

guess Joyce was right about doin'

the big comic book. We published the

thing as a graphic novel -- our first

collaboration -- and ended up with

rave reviews. We even won the American

Book Award. Go figure...

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Hey Joyce.

JOYCE

What is it Harvey?

HARVEY

That was the doctor.

HARVEY

He said I'm all clear.

CUT TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

The weirdest thing that came outta

my illness was Danielle. With her

real mother runnin' around who knows

where, an' seein' how well her and

Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd

have a better life with us. I was

scared at first but then I thought,

what the hell. She's a good kid. So

we ended up takin' her an' raising

her as our own.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Ya keep readin' 'em backward.

DANIELLE

I like reading them backward.

(holding up a comic)

Is that you?

HARVEY

I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me,

man.

DANIELLE

You look like a monster.

HARVEY

Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're

gonna look like.

DANIELLE

Me??

HARVEY

Sure. Yer part of the story too,

now.

DANIELLE

What story?

HARVEY

The story of my life.

HARVEY

Yeah, I know I'm not as interesting

as The Little Mermaid and all that

magical crap...

DANIELLE

Maybe I want to write my own comic.

HARVEY

Oh yeah? What about?

DANIELLE

I don't know yet. But not about you.

You have enough already.

CUT TO:

HARVEY

Ya know, you should write about things

in your own life. Like school and...

ponies... I don't know, girl stuff...

DANIELLE

(to Harvey)

Do you have to hold my hand?

HARVEY

(wounded)

What, are you embarrassed a' me? I

know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the

same way about my father.

DANIELLE

No Harvey. You're just squeezing it

too hard.

(shaking her head)

Joyce is right. You are obsessive

compulsive.

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a

lot. But don't think this is some

sunny, happy ending. Every day is

still a major struggle. Joyce an' I

fight like crazy, an' she barely

works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a

real handful. My expenses have gone

up so much that I'm writin' freelance

'round the clock, just to make my

bills. My life is total chaos.

DISSOLVE TO:

REAL HARVEY (V.O.)

With a little luck, I'll get a window

of good health between retirin' an

dyin'. The golden years, right? Who

knows. Between my pension and the

chunk of change I got for this movie,

I should be able to swing somethin'.

Sure I'll lose the war eventually,

but the goal is to win a few

skirmishes along the way. Right?

CUT TO:

FADE OUT:

THE END
