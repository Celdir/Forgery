LARRY CROWNE

LATER

LARRY CROWNE

Buddy. Park there and you'll get a

ticket.

PIZZA KID

Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in

sixty seconds.

(a dozen pizza boxes)

You guys having a party?

4.

STRANG

Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two-

K a year are history. Who else

would do us that favor?

ANDREWS

Wish they'd all sail off like her.

Save us some grief.

STRANG

The "R" Bomb is going to do some

collateral damage to this place.

HURLEY

"R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?

COX

Separating the chaff from the

wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff,

right?

HURLEY

Chaff is the waste matter, correct.

When are we restructuring?

COX

Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders.

STRANG

What say we drop a brick in the

pond to warn the herd?

ANDREWS

How?

STRANG

Firing someone.

COX

Someone they'd never expect to be

let go. To look fair. I like it.

STRANG

Like a Team Leader.

HURLEY

Team Leader?

STRANG

5.

COX

Suggestions on who it should be?

STRANG

I say Crowne.

HURLEY

Larry Crowne?

STRANG

Who else? Avery won't retire. We

fire him, it's a law suit.

STRANG (CONT'D)

Alvarez is about to drop a kid.

She'll go part time in a week.

STRANG (CONT'D)

Crowne's pink slip will save 'da

"U" big green backwash.

COX

What Salary Tier is Crowne at?

ANDREWS

Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L.

bump at the first of the year.

COX

Sweet. We'll need Actionable

Cause, of course.

COX (CONT'D)

How's his review record?

HURLEY

He's a candidate for Employee of

the Month. His 22nd time.

COX

Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a

reason...

6.

HURLEY

We could use the Limited Horizons

strategy.

(EXPLAINING)

Larry will always be passed over

for Management. He never went to

college.

COX

You're that familiar with his

record?

STRANG

She was his squeeze for a few

weeks, weren't you, Vick?

HURLEY

That was before the New Employee

Covenants. That you even

remember...

STRANG

The memory haunts me.

ANDREWS

He'll sock us for severance.

STRANG

Big brick in the pond, though.

COX

Let's call it. Today, end of

shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu.

VASQUEZ

LC Why still here?

7.

LARRY CROWNE

Team Leaders zone departments

before punching out. It's policy.

VASQUEZ

I mean here here. You just got

paged to Meeting Room 2.

LARRY CROWNE

Probably to clean up after the

party.

VASQUEZ

Isn't it Employee of the Month Day?

LARRY CROWNE

Speck-tack-alar.

VASQUEZ

You're the only one around here who

deserves it. How many will this

be?

LARRY CROWNE

Ah, who's counting?

LARRY CROWNE

Remember how we saw "The UniMart

Way" video, Vick? You and me,

alone in this room, and look at us

now.

STRANG

Cubby. Make tracks.

8.

LARRY CROWNE

I think I know what this is about.

STRANG

I don't think you do.

COX

Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So

we take care. Which makes moments

like these tough for all of us.

LARRY CROWNE

Sounds like you're firing me.

STRANG

I take it back.

COX

Corporate has mandated a

restructuring in all UniMart

stores. That's the word they use.

I call it a pain in the touchas.

(THEN)

It is touchas, right? Where you

get kicked?

HURLEY

Yeah. A yiddish word.

ANDREWS

Like the buttocks.

HURLEY

Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.

COX

Hurts to get kicked back there, no

matter what language you speak.

LARRY CROWNE

UniMart is firing me...

STRANG

Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.

LARRY CROWNE

Why me?

9.

ANDREWS

Who do you suggest? Alvarez?

Avery? I don't think so.

LARRY CROWNE

Why not Strang?

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

I've been here longer than you,

Jack. I started 21 years ago as an

Inventory Associate at the store on

Euclid.

HURLEY

Seniority would preclude this

reality, Larry, but UniMart's

policy is to never limit your

horizons.

COX

Here's the prob: your lack of a

graduate degree will forever retard

any move up the management ladder.

STRANG

Becasue you never went to college

you're forever retarded.

LARRY CROWNE

I won't make the Front Office?

STRANG

Never.

(shows his college ring)

S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs!

LARRY CROWNE

I went in the Navy. Right outta

high school. Five years, and by

then...

COX

Thank you for your service to our

country, Larry. And, in total

seriousness to UniMart too

10.

LARRY CROWNE

I thought I was Employee of the

Month.

STRANG

In a way, you are.

LARRY CROWNE

No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose

my house...

COX

The timing on this is always a

bitch.

LARRY CROWNE

Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys.

Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this.

Can't we fix this?

COX

Really wish we could.

(THEN)

Vick? The generous severance

package?

HURLEY

Sign here. Here. Here. Initial

that. Sign here. One more. Done.

VASQUEZ

12 jerks I'd fire before you.

May walk away from UniMart myself.

LARRY CROWNE

Stick it out. You go to college?

VASQUEZ

Couple years. Then I blew out my

KNEE

11.

LARRY CROWNE

Thanks for seeing me off.

VASQUEZ

I need your apron, man.

(AGAIN)

Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so

it ain't yours.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)

Thanks.

(WALKING AWAY)

Goofy car, man.

RECORDED VOICE

at RiverBank..."

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)

Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for

holding how may I help you?

LARRY CROWNE

I was holding for Barry Raphael in

Home and Real Estate?

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

Mr. Raphael is no longer with the

bank. How can I help you?

LARRY CROWNE

Barry is gone? I need to talk to

someone in Home and Real Estate.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

12.

LARRY CROWNE

(reading his ATM card)

I wish! I'm Customer number 566

7878 2031 339 and I can be there in

three minutes!

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)

As long as you are here before six,

okey dokey.

LARRY CROWNE

Three minutes!

LARRY CROWNE

What happened to Barry Raphael?

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (PRE-LAP)

Barry Raphael was harassing the

younger tellers but we are not

supposed to admit that.

(THE PAPERS)

This is some kick in the head.

Not sure what to tell you, Mr.

Crowne.

LARRY CROWNE

I m hoping not to lose my house.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

You're carrying what on the house?

LARRY CROWNE

$291,987.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble.

Three years ago I'd have loaned you

$700,000, but I think you read the

papers.

LARRY CROWNE

13.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD No.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (CONT'D)

But RiverBank does have a plan for

you.

(THE BROCHURE)

In a few weeks your financial base

will tell us what we can do. Find

new employment. Liquidate

everything low on the Value Index.

Stick to a budget. Clip coupons,

buy in bulk, you know the drill.

Then come back and we'll work with

you.

LARRY CROWNE

That's RiverBank's plan for me?

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...

LAMARR

Larry's home a little late tonight.

PATIENCE

Maybe he was out on a date.

14.

LAMARR

We'd see that on the news.

PATIENCE

Don't even think about lighting

that up in my house.

LARRY CROWNE

How do I offer this up to

Personnel?

PLANET STAFFER

There should be a box to put it in.

LARRY CROWNE

This?

PLANET STAFFER

No. There should be another box.

LARRY CROWNE

There isn't.

PLANET STAFFER

That's the one, then.

MR. PATTERSON

If you emailed an application,

we've got it and we'll keep you in

mind.

LARRY CROWNE

Just following up with an in-person

visit.

MR. PATTERSON

Mission accomplished.

LARRY CROWNE

You have a great location here.

MR. PATTERSON

Not with UniMart half a mile away.

LARRY CROWNE

I used to work for UniMart! I

could spill you some 411.

MR. PATTERSON

What's that mean?

17.

LARRY CROWNE

I know their trade secrets.

MR. PATTERSON

What secrets? Traffic boosters,

loss leaders and bait and switch!

LARRY CROWNE

And I'm ready to learn new

strategies. I'll stop by again so

you can keep me in mind.

MR. PATTERSON

If you won't work Sundays, don't

bother.

LARRY CROWNE

I'll work every day.

MR. PATTERSON

That's what I already do...

18.

CHEF AMOS

Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne.

I never forget anyone who quits on

me.

LARRY CROWNE

As I recall, I gave my notice and

worked all my shifts and that was

12 years ago.

CHEF AMOS

As I recall, I had to hire and

train a line cook to take your

place. Walking out doesn't happen

in a vacuum, you know.

(THEN)

Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a

job again. But you've been out of

the business a long time, and look

around. I don't need you.

RAUL

You come in two weeks ago I would

have kissed you on the mouth, but

Carlos and Nick, they walked in.

Best I can do? Put you at the top

of the list.

PERRY

Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I

could help you but Raul runs the

back.

19.

LARRY CROWNE

Not sure I could work here anyway.

The atmosphere is too pleasant and

the clientele too A Number 1.

PERRY

Breakfast on the house. Chorizo

Scramble, right?

LARRY CROWNE

No charity today. I got things to

do.

PERRY

Like what?

LARRY CROWNE

Nothing. I was just saying that.

LARRY

LAMARR

There's been a yard sale at 1402

Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky!

That gives me a monopoly on the

location! You go yard on me, Larry

Crowne and I will destroy you.

20.

LAMARR

Bloody Friday. Security sees you

off, by the time Monday comes

around the fired man is the

forgotten man. Diabolical.

LARRY CROWNE

They said it's because I didn't go

to college.

LAMARR

Smoke screen. The Man just wanted

you gone.

(his yard sale)

You liquidating assets to raise

cash?

LARRY CROWNE

Buying out Denise's half of the

house was the worst advice, ever.

LAMARR

I told you to avoid divorce

lawyers. Get married. Stay

married. Come with me.

LAMARR (CONT'D)

I'll tell you straight up - I'm not

lending you money.

PATIENCE

Whole box of Cha-Cha records from

the Fifties. You don't have any of

these, I promise.

LAMARR

He can't afford 'em Lost his job

21.

PATIENCE

No! UniMart just lost my business

forever!

LARRY CROWNE

I love you too.

PATIENCE

Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a

better job somewhere so you can

crush them.

LARRY CROWNE

Hard to do.

LAMARR

He's going to get something better

than a job.

(SEARCHING BOOKS)

An education.

LAMARR (CONT'D)

Get some knowledge and you'll be

fire proof.

LARRY CROWNE

Aren't there unemployed engineers

and geophysicists?

PATIENCE

Listen to my husband. Hasn't

called a man boss in years. Paid

off the house.

LARRY CROWNE

You won the Lottery.

PATIENCE

Picked 8 little numbers when I kept

saying he was a fool. A quarter

million dollars later I've shut up.

LAMARR

Lost half to taxes.

LARRY CROWNE

I'll see if there's a class in here

for PowerBall 250.

22.

LAMARR

That's half a buck for the book.

LARRY CROWNE

They give these away free.

LAMARR

They do. I don't.

BUSIK

Back to college, huh?

LARRY CROWNE

First time. I was in the Navy.

BUSIK

(HIMSELF)

Coast Guard. Adventure of a

Lifetime.

LARRY CROWNE

Galley Mate.

23.

BUSIK

We teach a whole track in Hotel and

Restaurant Food Preparation.

LARRY CROWNE

No. No, no. I need an all-new

career and a place to go everyday.

BUSIK

Those two things are my specialty.

BUSIK (CONT'D)

First thing. Bravo for choosing

East City College. Never too late

for an education. Second, you need

a jolt to the confidence machinery.

BUSIK (CONT'D)

I am going to change your life.

(a page in the catalog)

Speech 217: The Art of Informal

Remarks, cause it's not enough to

just be smart anymore, you have to

project ease even when it ain't

easy.

LARRY CROWNE

Is this Public Speaking?

BUSIK

It's training. Job interviews will

be a breeze with the confidence

you'll get from Speech Two One

Seven.

(even better...)

And you'll spend three hours a week

with the most attractive package in

all of Academia. The Golden Girl

of East City.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I'm here. Shut up. Turn off!

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Jerk!

LARRY CROWNE

Sorry! Parking's impossible today!

MERCEDES TAINOT

Are you new to the Faculty?

LARRY CROWNE

New to the Student Body.

MERCEDES TAINOT

This is the Faculty Lot. We've

earned degrees for these spaces.

Students park on Mars.

LARRY CROWNE

I'm going to be late for my first

day of school.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I bet it won't be the first time.

MERCEDES TAINOT

This is it?

MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

My day has just been made and it's

only 8:02 in the morning!

(THEN)

This class...is CANCELLED!!

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

The city charter requires a minimum

of ten students per class,

otherwise it costs more to have us

here than not. Did you really want

a class at 8 AM? I didn't. Throw

out those alarm clocks!

LARRY CROWNE

Please tell me this is Speech 217.

MERCEDES TAINOT

While earning a Masters in

Shakespearean Political Discourse

from Vassar, I learned to care.

Caring is a prerequisite for this

class I have to teach in this

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Participate. Show up on time.

(Larry gets a eye on that)

Care. And stay awake the 55

minutes three dawns a week I have

to be here, or I will fail you and

not care.

(a name on the board)

My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie-

knot'. Tay-no. You will each

address the class on Wednesday. A

procedure. How. To do. Something.

DIBIASI

Ms. Tie-knot?

DIBIASI (CONT'D)

Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Who are you?

DIBIASI

Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me

Nomad. Only two days before I

gotta get up and give my address?

You may be dreaming.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Why are you here, Steve?

DIBIASI

Counsellor Busik said this class

would change my life.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Busik. Of course...

DIBIASI

I gotta take this...

27.

LARRY CROWNE

Look at us, in two classes in a

row.

PINEDO

Yes. Hi.

LARRY CROWNE

That Ms. Tainot is something else

isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge

life and, I confess, she sca es e

This whole place scares me.

PINEDO

Yes.

LARRY CROWNE

I woke up this morning so nervous

about the first day of school. I

changed my clothes three times.

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm

babbling.

PINEDO

I am Lala.

DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.)

I order you to turn off all cell

phones, smart phones, and any phone-

DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

That's me! Read this book Follow

DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

none of you have fled. A good

economic indicator.

LARRY CROWNE

I like this guy...

PINEDO

Yes...

The clock shows 3:09. MERCEDES TAINOT

What happened to the 16 sign-ups?

(NOTHING)

Shakespeare as I know him... is

cancelled.

29.

LAMARR

What's cookin' Joe College?

LARRY CROWNE

Money woes. Paying for gas, getting

to school.

(THEN)

You ever come across a moped or a

scooter for sale or trade?

LAMARR

Come with me.

PATIENCE

Your next wife might stand smoking

that pipe in the house but your

first one says 'uh-uh!'

On the old TV on "Wheel of Fortune" (A person).

LAMARR

Passing through, woman...

PATIENCE

Larry Crowne, been thinking about

you. Sit down here...

LARRY CROWNE

"College Graduate."

PATIENCE

That's going to be you someday.

30.

PATIENCE (CONT'D)

You have money in all those

records. If you can part with

them, they'd go for something on

the eBay. I'll show you how...

LAMARR

This what you're talking about?

LARRY CROWNE

That's a hunk of junk.

LAMARR

This is classic.

LARRY CROWNE

It doesn't work.

LAMARR

It will for eight hundred dollars.

negotiation is for both of us to

win Talk to me How much do you

LAMARR

Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet.

(SHOWING HIM)

Gas. Brake. Light's busted.

Tires are low. You'll need a

LARRY CROWNE

All I need is the open road.

LAMARR

MERCEDES TAINOT

Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water

Torture. And Speech at Sunrise

DEAN TAINOT

I built a Flamethrower of a posting

for WarriorWeb which, if I do say,

will feed nicely as an outline for

was a guest blogger on CyberShare.

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

Y u don't believe me.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Why wouldn't I believe you?

DEAN TAINOT

I was composing, Mercy. That's

what I do all day.

MERCEDES TAINOT

You were looking at porn.

MERCEDES TAINOT

33.

DEAN TAINOT

It's barely porn. I'm not hiding

it.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Yes you are.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Brain freeze.

DEAN TAINOT

Don't chug. Sip.

(THEN)

Everyone hides something.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I have no secrets from you. I

share the whole miserable slate.

DEAN TAINOT

You walked in the door pissed off

because -- I'm sorry -- I've

established a beach head in New

Media while you still have to teach

at Vassar of the Valley. You hide

that.

MERCEDES TAINOT

(SERIOUS EYES)

You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X

expecting me to pretend I don't

know or I don't care. I do both

and don't like it.

DEAN TAINOT

It may look like I don't work hard

around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm

just a guy who's a guy being a guy

when you're not around...

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

And walking away is great for a

relationship...

DEAN TAINOT

TALIA

LARRY CROWNE

I am?

TALIA

That class is straining my coconut.

LARRY CROWNE

It's only been one day

TALIA

Didn't know you scooted.

LARRY CROWNE

New to the sport.

TALIA

(pulls out mobile phone)

Give me your number. I'll

introduce you to like-minded

enthusiasts.

(THEN)

Name please?

36.

LARRY CROWNE

Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.

TALIA

'Larry'? I don't think so. I used

to be Kathleen but one day I looked

in the mirror and saw a girl named

Talia.

(then in her phone)

Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check

your texts and we'll do us some

scooting.

(THEN)

Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a

polo shirt into khakis makes you

look like a cop.

LARRY CROWNE

Not much fashion sense.

TALIA

I know! Gotta change that...

LARRY CROWNE

Gotta go!

TALIA

Then get going!!

MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)

Go.

LARRY CROWNE

My presentation will be on the

subject of a very particular

procedure. "How to make French

Toast", but I'll speak English...

MERCEDES TAINOT

M classes were once filled with

e rnest young men ready to learn

all I had to teach them. Cute boys

fresh out of High School who all

had crushes on me from day one. Now

look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound

for jail. Mack. Treating college

like another tour of combat.

Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd

be Osric in Act 5. The part that is

always cut.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Busik, I am going to kill you. You

can't suggest these saps take

Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me

in at this ungodly hour for 2

minutes on French toast?

LARRY CROWNE

Most people think syrup comes out of

a plastic bottle.

MERCEDES TAINOT

(still talking to herself)

Great. The history of the sugar

maple tree now. Thank you

But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up.

LARRY CROWNE

That went fast...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Breakfast may never be ready.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

I just bought it and ride around.

TALIA

You good, Lance?

LARRY CROWNE

Other than school, I have nothing to

do.

DELL GORDO

Let's troll Buena Vista for junk

stores.

STAN

We hit those last week.

TALIA

If it was Saturday we'd look for

yard sales.

LARRY CROWNE

I know where a yard sale is, like

everyday.

TALIA

Lead the way.

(YELLING)

Monkey! Lance knows a yard sale!

42.

DELL GORDO

Take point!

LARRY CROWNE

Follow me, boys and girl!

LAMARR

We're being invaded!

LAMARR (CONT'D)

Larry, what kind of thugs you get

in with?

LARRY CROWNE

College buddies.

LAMARR

If they're college buddies why

aren't they in college?

TALIA

You have any old clothes?

LAMARR

Speak to my bride inside.

DELL GORDO

Oh man! These TV trays are too

much!

LAMARR

Bargains at $100 apiece.

DELL GORDO

For these? Are you nuts?

LAMARR

I'm joking, kid. Let's get to

haggling.

43.

DELL GORDO I

get it.

(THEN)

A buck apiece.

LAMARR

YOU

Ninety-nine dollars apiece.

see how this is working?

DELL GORDO

Two bucks apiece!

LAMARR

Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this

every day.

TALIA

Layer this... with this.

PATIENCE

Add this belt?

TALIA

I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?

PATIENCE

Reeled it in like tuna from the

Atlantic.

TALIA

Diamonds in a diamond mine.

Take this... under this...unbutton

that.

PATIENCE

You and I are going to spend some

time together!

44.

DOORBELL RINGS

TALIA

I gotta see Chez Lance.

LARRY CROWNE

Entrez vous, sea food plate.

TALIA

No sign of a woman around here for

years. Drape a scarf over that

lamp and you'll soften the light.

No TV, b t vinyl disks of music?

You trying to seduce me?

TALIA (CONT'D)

Alphabetical order. No artistic

chaos for you.

TALIA (CONT'D)

Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?

LARRY CROWNE

Good choice.

KITCHEN

TALIA

Breakfast nookie!

(THEN)

45.

TALIA (CONT'D)

Did Denise make you breakfast in

here with a little apron and

lipstick perfectly applied?

LARRY CROWNE

I did most of the cooking,

actually.

(THEN)

You know about Denise?

TALIA

Patience thought she was stuck up

and seriously fleeced you.

TALIA (CONT'D)

So what happened there, my Lance?

LARRY CROWNE

The usual stuff between three

people.

TALIA

She must have been pretty.

(THEN)

Fair haired or dark?

LARRY CROWNE

Dark.

TALIA

Like me.

(THEN)

So? How about a demonstration?

he means 'of the kitchen'. Larry's game...

LARRY CROWNE

Stay outta my way.

BEER OPENED

46.

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

Cooking for friends is sort of fun.

Three hundred times a day is not.

DELL GORDO (O.C.)

That corn bread I smell?

TALIA

Kitchen, Monkey!

DELL GORDO

Corn pone!

TALIA

Lance made all this. You should

have seen him. He was like...

DELL GORDO

You're like Uncle Ben or something.

Stan's working on your bike.

LARRY CROWNE

He is?

DELL GORDO

Said the thing was a time bomb.

He's saving your life.

DELL GORDO (CONT'D)

Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a

shoulders and arms day

(MORE)

47.

DELL GORDO (CONT'D)

Lance, raise your right hand and

say something patriotic.

LARRY CROWNE

'We'll be right back after these

messages.'

DELL GORDO

You're in the Street Patrol. A

full-time mission for beauty and

justice.

TALIA

That Denise. What a fool. You a e

way cooler than you appear.

DELL GORDO

Lance. All men fall in love with

Talia. You will too, if you

haven't already. But I love her

the most. Know that right now.

LARRY CROWNE

Capice.

DELL GORDO

Seriously. Don't make me keep my

eyes on you. What's your real

name?

LARRY CROWNE

L rry.

DELL GORDO

Mine's Don. Shake hands.

(EXPLAINING HOW)

Look each other in the eyes. Firm

grips. No contest, but firm. Hold.

Stack it.

One word, Lance. Peace.

LARRY CROWNE

Peace indeed.

LARRY CROWNE

Speck-tack-alar.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (OVERLAPPING)

Even business can break down into a

Shakespearean Five-Act Structure!

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Act I: Inventory. What do you

sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach

your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of

accounting. Receivable.

Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward

planning. Plan to grow. Act Five?

Final Profitability. What do you

clear on bottom-line?

In other words: "To be or not to

MERCEDES TAINOT

notes. So it can be done.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

White, Siler and Koss, you are up

next time.

(THEN)

You did good, Fran. Thanks.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Anything for the woman who brought

out the public speaker in Frances

Taylor-Briegh.

(THEN)

I used you as a Focal Reference but

you weren't there for me. What's

wrong, Mercy?

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)

(WHISPERING)

I broke up with the Orthodontist.

Now I have to get a new boyfriend

and a new orthodontist. You ever

do that? Get crushes on people you

see every day after ignoring them

and then find out they're creeps

after all?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Mr Crowne? Can you move along

50.

LARRY CROWNE

That was a great presentation. I

learned a lot from it.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Super.

LARRY CROWNE

Smart stuff. Super smart.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going

on?

MERCEDES TAINOT

When was the last time you looked

at your life and saw nothing but

fraud and desperation?

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Mercy. You're an idol to me.

Hearing you talk like that is

crushing my dreams.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Well I'm joking of course!!!

DR. MATSUTANI

If the balance on Axis A is the

same metric as Axis B you're in

deficits because of overhead,

taxes, and re-investment.

(THEN)

Translation? Ms. Francesco?

TALIA

Something complicated.

DR. MATSUTANI

Ms. Pinedo?

51.

DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

Mr. Crowne?

LARRY CROWNE

Breaking even is not making profit,

it's a theoretical assumption.

Economics abhors an assumption.

DR. MATSUTANI

Someone's been reading my book.

(THEN)

The Break Even Paradox creates a

new metric...

Palm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

I am growing tired of this game,

Mr. Crowne. Aren't you?

LARRY CROWNE

So what happens here?

TALIA

You ready?

Re-invention Big Boy

52.

LARRY CROWNE

I have no idea what that means, but

you betcha.

LARRY CROWNE

Holy smokes!

LARRY CROWNE (CONT D)

You got inventory.

TALIA

I started in the smallest unit.

LARRY CROWNE

This is just sitting here? Talia!

This is unproductive capital! Sell

it on eBay.

TALIA

No one should ever buy clothes off

the internet. You have to feel the

fabric and test the drape...

LARRY CROWNE

What is all this worth?

TALIA

A lot to me. Try these on.

LARRY CROWNE

Where?

TALIA

Anywhere. Fashion is no place for

modesty. Strip.

LARRY CROWNE

53.

TALIA

This is a service to humankind,

Lance. It hurts me to see a Top

Cat dressed like an ex-hockey

player. You gotta look gorgeous

from shoe to collar. Starting now.

DELL GORDO

Monkey! Thought you might be here.

TALIA

Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put

your pants on!

DEAN TAINOT

No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm

a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful

and brilliant. And I will be a

good boy from now on. Why?

Because you're right and I've

learned my lesson. Just don't be

mad at me forever. I have a

pliable soul and I pray you do too

54.

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

Ah. That was nice.

MERCEDES TAINOT

It was. Yes.

DEAN TAINOT

Been thinking. If you ever want to

take a whack at writing something --

say a blog a couple of times a week --

I could help you out.

MERCEDES TAINOT

How?

DEAN TAINOT

I'd read your stuff. Make comments

to make it web-savvy. Pieces need

to pop, you know. Takes a little

PRACTICE

MERCEDES TAINOT

Okay.

DEAN TAINOT

See? You can't stay mad at me. No

reason to be mad at me...

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

I'm just a guy who's a guy being a

55.

DENISE

This is Denise. How can I help

you.

LARRY CROWNE

Denise. Larry.

DENISE

My god. Larry Crowne. I remember

you.

LARRY CROWNE

This a good time?

DENISE

Other than me being at work?

LARRY CROWNE

I'll call you later.

DENISE

I'm surprised is all. What do you

want?

LARRY CROWNE

Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.

DENISE

Spit it, Lar.

LARRY CROWNE

I'm going to miss a few months on

the checks for the house.

DENISE

Okay.

LARRY CROWNE

I hoped not to, but I there it is.

DENISE

Okay. Yeah.

LARRY CROWNE

I'm sorry.

56.

DENISE

How many months?

LARRY CROWNE

Let's start with six.

DENISE

That can't happen, Larry.

I'm extended. I've put a deposit

down on the first vacation I've had

in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as

valid as yours, so I need the

checks like always. A deal's a

deal.

LARRY CROWNE

I don't have it.

DENISE

That's not my problem. Take out a

loan on the house or something.

LARRY CROWNE

I tried. I'm too much of a risk.

DENISE

Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't

want to open up the whole lawyer

thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks,

doesn't it? I appreciate the

rigorous Crowne honesty, but this

can't happen.

(THEN)

These calls are monitored to

guarantee customer satisfaction, so

I'm hanging up before my supervisor

comes on...

57.

PERRY

Can I smell trouble or what?

RAUL

Can you speak English?

PERRY

Those two over in booth 6...

PERRY (CONT'D)

Homeland Security. I piped thei

badges and everything.

RAUL

here...

RAUL

This is Larry Crowne?

LARRY CROWNE

Raul? Yes.

RAUL

Get your ass down here. You got a

job.

LARRY CROWNE

I do?

PERRY

We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back

there!

RAUL

You're late on your first day!

LATER

RAUL

Where you learn to turn eggs like

59.

LARRY CROWNE

The USS Coral Sea.

(THEN)

Boss, I don't want to quit school.

RAUL

So don't.

LARRY CROWNE

I gotta get to class before I miss

the whole day. And I can't work

mornings Mondays, Wednesdays,

Fridays.

RAUL

Soon as the rush is finished, go.

I'll get my idiot brother-in-law

three days a week. You take

evenings. Deal?

LARRY CROWNE

Deal. When will we talk salary?

RAUL

Never. This is take it or leave

it. Don t worry. I may be tough

but I'll be fair.

MACK

These are not toys. Nobody 'plays'

with these. These are kept behind

glass, so no way am I passing them

around today.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Wait a ding dong minute.

(counts the heads)

1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is

missing! Who cut my class?

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Where's Larry Crowne?!

60.

MACK

Guess Larry's out today.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Anyone know why?

MACK

He didn't call me.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I don't believe this! Ditching me?

He ditched me? Not okay. Larry

Crowne, you are on my Shit List.

DIBIASI

Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a

Teach-ee.

CALIMERIS

When you were out last week, she

said nothing. I think she has a

crush on Larry Crowne.

PINEDO

I do too.

(off their looks)

He's a nice man.

MACK

Should I continue?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Yes. Tell us more about your man

dolls.

MACK

I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba

Fett...

61.

LARRY CROWNE

(QUIETLY)

I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani.

May I still sit in the class?

DR. MATSUTANI

This is college, Mr. Crowne. The

only thing you can't do is smoke in

the building. Hand over your

phone.

(LARRY DOES)

I'm going to ask a question in a

moment. I want someone other than

you to answer it - I don't care if

the silence is positively Arctic.

DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

This brings us to a dreaded task to

every corporate entity. What is

the purpose of semi-annual re-

purposing? Anyone?

(THEN)

Anyone?

LARRY CROWNE

(WHISPERING)

Lala... To upload market

differences without...

PINEDO

Without mooting the quarterlies. I

know.

LARRY CROWNE

Then say it.

(SHE WON'T)

Just give the answer. You know it.

Say it.

PINEDO

Can I?

62.

LARRY CROWNE I

insist.

PINEDO

To up... met... es without ...ing

DR. MATSUTANI

I know what you mean, but please

share it with your classmates?

PINEDO

(LOUD ENOUGH)

To upload market differences

without mooting quarterly

predictions.

DR. MATSUTANI

Does this affect the Value Index?

PINEDO

No. Only the profit markdown.

DR. MATSUTANI

Someone is doing the reading!

QUAD HAIR STYLIST. Lala is weighing in with her opinion on

MERCEDES TAINOT

Is that Larry Crowne!?

(HE STOPS)

You have a lot of nerve showing

your face on campus after ditching

my class!

LARRY CROWNE

I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not

miss another class, this I vow.

63.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne.

You'll lead off next assignment

with three minutes on a personal

first. A story, with details, not

a laundry list or slide show. And,

as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to

hear about the first time you got

laid.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Or the most recent.

TALIA

That woman is one clenched fist of

fury.

TALIA

She must not be having any amok

lovin'.

SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST

That makes me cranky, too.

TALIA

Without a workout in the Inner

Sanctum a few times a week I can't

concentrate.

LARRY CROWNE

Inappropriate subject in mixed

company.

SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST

For girl-talk this is nothing.

LARRY CROWNE

64.

TALIA

You you want to fix it with your

teacher? Bang her.

LARRY CROWNE

She's marred.

TALIA

You'd kill two birds in one bush.

Nothing wrong with a campus

romance. Otherwise life is what?

Breakfast work, coffee, school,

lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk,

Mexican food, a movie, glass of

wine or two then bed? That's not

living.

SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST

Not without some smooching time.

TALIA

Bet she'd give you an A plus.

(THEN)

If you're any good...

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

More complimentary coffee?

LARRY CROWNE

Complimentary coffee is usually

lousy.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

I drink it all day.

(THEN)

So? You're back!

65.

LARRY CROWNE

I got a job.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

Atta Baby!

LARRY CROWNE

Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all

day. And I'm going to school.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

At East City. I see.

(from the papers)

Larry, this doesn't change

anything.

LARRY CROWNE

I was afraid of that.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

The interest alone will eat up your

service industry salary.

LARRY CROWNE

It's been a few weeks.

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

Okay.

(THEN)

I will personally take this to my

supervisor and fight to get you the

loan you need. But you know how

complimentary coffee is always

lousy? Your chances are, too.

LARRY CROWNE

I can't make the payments on the

house. I'm going to lose it,

aren't I?

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

Stop with the gloomy puss. You're

doing everything right. Hang in

there. You still have a friend at

RiverBank.

LARRY CROWNE

You guys are forced to say that,

aren't you?

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

DELL GORDO

I think it's letting up.

TALIA

It's going to storm till next year.

DELL GORDO

We can't stay here all day. Find a

raincoat and let's get a little

wet.

TALIA

I do not scoot in the rain.

DELL GORDO

How you going to get to school

then, College Co-Ed Belle?

TALIA

My savior! Look at your new

schmatas.

(HOLDING BOOTS)

And footwear!

(hopping in, to Dell)

Stay dry, sweetie!

MERCEDES TAINOT (PRE-LAP)

I got engaged to a teacher/writer

with two books in print...

67.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

I never read them.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Who did? I'm married to an ex-

teacher turned blogger with two

books in print. And oh, yes, he has

the libido and internet access of a

13-year-old.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

I had a boyfriend who owned every

movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d

hear a DVD go into the playe an

knew what I was going to be doing in

a half-hour.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Once more to Divorce Court to

cashier a spouse, line my cloak

with alimony and do myself homage.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to

Roderigo.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Why can't all my students be like

y u?

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Because, as I learned in your

class, I am one of a kind.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)

Hey, that guy's in your class.

MERCEDES TAINOT

68.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a

leash!

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

That's why he's in college! To get

laid!

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

It happens.

MERCEDES TAINOT

You are everything that's wrong

with America, Larry Crowne!

DIBIASI

Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know

you were gay. You've gone all

Project Runway on us.

LARRY CROWNE

Should I begin?

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

69.

MERCEDES TAINOT

(talking to herself in the MOVIE

DEVICE WAY)

Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.

(THEN)

Look at the new pants. They

actually fit. And that jacket is

'smart'. Did Busik put Larry

Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An

old goat dressed like lamb.

(THEN)

Of course! It's that doe-eyed

young thing he's been wearing on

his sleeve. Dressing like he's

half his age. Give me a shotgun!

I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now!

(THEN)

Am I being unfair? I mean, if I

were single and some young buck

took to me, wouldn't I be inclined

to diddly-dally?

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Youth wouldn't be the only

requirement, of course.

DIBIASI

(jerking out buds)

What? What he say?

LARRY CROWNE

Unless you're looking at a chart,

you don't even know the Equator

when you cross it...

MERCEDES TAINOT

A repackaged Larry Crowne won't

fool me. Shame on you. Going

after jail bait, you criminal.

Insert Viagra joke here...

(THEN)

herself at you... No. Don't let

up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY!

70.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Anyone recall anything from that?

PINEDO

That Larry believed there were

signs on posts marking the Equator.

CALIMERIS

And that, when it's a first time,

they make the rookies dress in drag

and sing Abba songs?

MACK

Larry worked on an Aircraft

Carrier! Night Carrier Landings

are the trickiest flying in world.

MERCEDES TAINOT

That was a memorable nugget.

PINEDO

Larry was stationed in Panama! My

father is from Panama!

MERCEDES TAINOT

Mr. Koss to the lectern, please.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I'm not complaining. I'm stating

the truth. I teach while you

pretend to work.

DEAN TAINOT

I had three postings today alone.

FogCaster, SkyScan, and

ParsecTwelve.com

MERCEDES TAINOT

Those weren't postings. They were

comments.

DEAN TAINOT

Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to

judge me?

(THEN)

I know what's really pissing you

off. I like big titties. And you

don't have any.

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

Maybe I should take that back.

MERCEDES TAINOT

LET ME OUT OF THIS FUCKING CAR!!!

76.

JANET

As soon as I saw you, I said, "I

want to go out with that man."

TONY

What did you say when I asked you

out?

JANET

I said "Yes." You were there,

remember?

TONY

I saw you and I thought "I would be

a lucky guy if she'd go out with

me."

JANET

Yes you are.

TONY

Honestly, this is about as good a

first date goes, isn't it?

JANET

Disaster looms on most first dates,

but I'm talking to you like you're a

friend I want to make out with.

TONY

Hold that thought.

DEAN TAINOT

I take it back. I take it back.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Drive, asshole! Drive away!

DEAN TAINOT

I've been drinking, too.

I was heading home.

(TO TALIA)

Right? We're done scooting?

TALIA

Not me. I love riding in the

night. Magic happens.

(TO LANCE)

79.

MERCEDES TAINOT

What do men see in irritating free

spirits?

LARRY CROWNE

Seriously. I offer you a ride.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Seriously. I don't want one.

LARRY CROWNE

I've yet to give anyone a lift on

this but I think I can get you home

with a scraped elbow, worst case.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts

black boil up from my soul. Major

consequences sure to follow.

You'll read about them on

Parsectwelve.com.

LARRY CROWNE

An attractive woman like you

walking alone is a dumb idea.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I need a man flirting with me right

now like I need a dog crapping on my

lawn. I'm hoofing it.

LARRY CROWNE

In those shoes?

MERCEDES TAINOT

A man who notices shoes.

(GIVING UP)

All right. I'll be your Cycle

Slut.

LARRY CROWNE

Put this on.

(HIS HELMET)

Strap your legs round my engine and

80.

MERCEDES TAINOT

It won't be a terrible thing if you

kill us both.

LARRY CROWNE

Ain't you a ball of fun?

IN MOTION

MERCEDES TAINOT

Are you really going to go this

slow?

LARRY CROWNE

I do want to survive this night.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Fine. I have time to window shop.

Oh look, a sale on tires at

AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox.

I've never noticed their perfect

design and colo scheme. This is

so slow a cat could knock us over.

LARRY CROWNE

Where am I taking you?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Down to Portola and left to

Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo.

Right on Palermo till I yell stop.

LARRY CROWNE

I may use this as a presentation in

class.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Try it and you'll flunk.

81.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

LARRY CROWNE

I like your class. You're making

us all do things we never thought

we could.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Put the shovel away and just get me

home, 'kay?

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Hail our City's Finest.

LARRY CROWNE

Someone's getting pinched...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Measure his dick, officer! He's

too diminutive to drive!

(THEN)

Tiny dick loser!

LARRY CROWNE

Bad night for that guy.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Best night I've had in years!

Drive on, McDuff!

82.

LARRY CROWNE

Unit 114.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Thanks for the ox-cart ride.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

I can see the Alarm Pad. I know

the code. But my hands aren't

working.

(THEN)

Help me.

LARRY CROWNE

You don't want to give me your pass

code.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Just hold my hand up to the

numbers. I'll manage from there.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Look away now.

(HE DOES)

Two two two two. Pound.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car.

The key please? It's buried in

that plant.

LARRY CROWNE

This it?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Why I think it is!

LARRY CROWNE

I'll get the door for you

83.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Take one step inside and I call

security.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

And forget this ever happened.

LARRY CROWNE

What?

MERCEDES TAINOT

This whole sorry chapter tonight.

LARRY CROWNE

What?

MERCEDES TAINOT

You passing up Gidget for a flat

old coot like me.

LARRY CROWNE

What are you talking about?

MERCEDES TAINOT

What, you have no short-term

memory?

LARRY CROWNE

When I say 'what', it means I get

it and have already purposefully

forgotten everything. Call it

irony.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant

lands in the drunk tank while

Goofus scoots me home.

LARRY CROWNE

Goodnight, Ms. Tainot.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not

see that?

LARRY CROWNE

I assumed you preferred Ms

84.

MERCEDES TAINOT

When we presume we make a pretty

pair of asses of me and you or

something like that.

(THEN)

Why aren't you married?

LARRY CROWNE

That's a long story and it's late.

(THEN)

My helmet?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Help yourself.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

I noticed something on the ride.

LARRY CROWNE

WHAT

MERCEDES TAINOT

IT MAY

You smell good.

LARRY CROWNE

Thanks.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Do you have a crush on me? Single

student. Unattainable teacher. It's

common.

LARRY CROWNE

We all have crushes on you. Even

the gals.

MERCEDES TAINOT

You want to make out with me, you

can. I know I'm not a third rate

Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still

GOT MOVES

(MORE)

85.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5

years.

LARRY CROWNE

Wow...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Pretty dang good. I still got it,

no?

LARRY CROWNE

Yes, you do..

(THEN)

In you go.

(Mercedes goes in)

Close the door.

(SHE DOES)

Lock it!

LARRY CROWNE (O.S.)

Goodnight, whoever you are!

MERCEDES TAINOT

Whoever I am...

86.

DEAN TAINOT

Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...

(THEN)

Mercy!!!

LARRY CROWNE

BENCH AREA

87.

TALIA

MERCY

TALIA

Oh, come on! I left you all set

up! What went down?

LARRY CROWNE

Epilog. School today.

TALIA

Lance! A Betty on your Scooter

after midnight? Holding on, her

arms around you, pressed against

your back, is a license to at least

cop a feel.

LARRY CROWNE

If we had ended up making out, you

still wouldn't hear it.

MERCY

88.

PINEDO

Seeing them -- the Northern Lights,

the Aurora Borealis -- should have

been beyond me, but I was a little

girl in Coach class still awake, a

window seat, a moonless night

somewhere over Greenland with a

shimmering curtain of emerald,

gossamer light dancing just for me.

(THEN)

That is something I will remember

forever.

The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI

That was a knockout speech, Lala.

Made the news. Caused riots

downtown. School's out til 2019.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Mr. Crowne? A moment please?

CALIMERIS

Why doesn't she just throw herself

at him?

PINEDO

This is bordering on harassment

now.

DIBIASI

Quiet down. I'm watching the TV

show...

MACK

Why doesn't this ever happen to me?

89.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I need a few moments alone with Mr.

Crowne thank you.

DIBIASI

Move along folks. Privacy's a

right in this great nation of ours.

MACK

You want I should close this door,

lock it, and barricade it so you

won't be disturbed??

LARRY CROWNE

How are the Triplets? Groggy,

Puffy, and Grumpy.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Last night was a confluence of too

many things happening in too short

a time span.

LARRY CROWNE

Last i ht? Let's see, what was I

doing? Studying some. Working

some. Can't recall. I've forgotten

everything that happened last night

as best a gentleman can.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I had no right to judge you or your

relationships. Date who you want.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

But what happened last night --

between adults -- was

inappropriate. If gossip were to

circulate, the problem could be

more than just embarrassing. My

status as a professor could be

tarnished.

LARRY CROWNE

I wouldn't want that.

MERCEDES TAINOT

(MORE)

90.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

With parking attendants. Strangers

at parties when I've had a bit too

much of the demon rum. This was the

first time with a student.

(THEN)

I hope the entire thing will be

forgotten.

LARRY CROWNE

Sure. Nothing happened. At all.

MERCEDES TAINOT

So there will be no bravado among

you and your pals?

LARRY CROWNE

None.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Thank you, Mr. Crowne.

LARRY CROWNE

I'd better scurry along to Dr.

Matsutani's class. I hope I don't

have this same conversation with

him.

LAMARR

Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.

(THEN)

See? Works.

LARRY CROWNE

I have to sell my car.

91.

LARRY CROWNE

If I could afford a new top I could

afford to keep it.

LAMARR

What's the job paying you?

LARRY CROWNE

Half my UniMart salary.

LAMARR

You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as

dirt.

LARRY CROWNE

I'm looking back on the year Denise

left as the good old days.

LAMARR

Hang in there, neighbor.

LARRY CROWNE

Everyone keeps saying that.

LAMARR

I was in the same spot. Look what

happened.

LARRY CROWNE

The odds of two people on the same

street winning the lottery are

worse than one person on the street

winning the lottery.

LAMARR

I read how the universe is

expanding, Larry, taking us along

with it. That is a wild concept to

grasp, but what it means is, we all

have to hold on tight sometimes to

get to where we're going to be.

LARRY CROWNE

(THE PIPE)

This thing must be making me dizzy.

What?

LAMARR

Keep your grip. You'll be okay.

It's like the wife always says...

92.

LAMARR (CONT'D)

A woman with a measuring tape?

That's money in my pocket.

AISLE

REGISTER

HURLEY

' ind bargains today?'

LARRY CROWNE

Vick? How you doing? Larry

Crowne.

HURLEY

Larry. Hi.

LARRY CROWNE

Why are you on the Register?

93.

HURLEY

Management Execs are now required

to put in 8-hour shifts on the

floor. Every day. No overtime.

No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or

UniMart Bargain Card? Like you

have one of them.

LARRY CROWNE

Cash. No receipt.

HURLEY

You got out of here just in time...

'Thank you for choosing UniMart,

where united we blah blah.'

DEAN TAINOT

Hi.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Thanks for coming.

DEAN TAINOT

No notice. No preamble. Just an

email and a google map.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I knew you'd be on the computer.

(THEN)

Working...

DEAN TAINOT

Point made.

(THEN)

So. What up.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Are we making a mistake here?

DEAN TAINOT

94.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Point made. We could change

things. We could start right now.

DEAN TAINOT

We could. Why should we?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Because we have history, Dean. But

first, my thoughts... I've got to

address drinking. I should be

able to comprehend and respond to

both sides of our conversations. And

the morning shower should be

refreshing, not a hangover cure.

DEAN TAINOT

I'd like that too.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Really?

DEAN TAINOT

You're not a pleasant woman after a

few glasses. Mornings with you are

to be survived.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Okay. Now, you.

DEAN TAINOT

I see. I'm what this is all about.

MERCEDES TAINOT

There are plenty of items on the

relationship agenda but let's start

here.

DEAN TAINOT

You're talking about you but you

really mean me.

(THEN)

I am not yelling or begging or

saying you have to stop doing

anything. So you don't get to

either.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I'm not saying that.

95.

DEAN TAINOT

We've both been here before. Why

prolong the process? White flag! I

give up. This ain't working.

(THEN)

I'll sign papers and checks, see if

there's enough for a cool sports

car as a reward for the last few

years and eventually I will be fine

and you will too. But I am never

once going to look at myself as

another poor divorced guy who could

still be married if only he had

done the mea culpa bit for all his

faults.

(THEN)

I just now came up with that, and

it is going to be my next posting.

DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)

I don't think there is anything

else to talk about. Do you?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Here I have surprise topics.

Friday, in a Lightning Round, you

must wax on that topic for 2

minutes without pause, repetition,

or lack of charm. No notes. One

visual aid.

(THEN)

Ms Pinedo Draw

96.

MS. PINEDO

'Potatoes?'

MERCEDES TAINOT

Spuds. Can't wait.

DIBIASI

'Disraeli'? What is that?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Who is that?

DIBIASI

It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done.

LARRY CROWNE

'Consumerism'.

MERCEDES TAINOT

That's supposed to say 'Communism.'

LARRY CROWNE

The handwriting is loopy. Looks

like 'Consumerism'.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism.

CALIMERIS

'Malpity Hoople.'

(THEN)

What's this say?

MERCEDES TAINOT

No idea. Just pick another.

97.

DR. MATSUTANI

(HIS BOOK))

At the end of each chapter is a

study guide. Master those and you

will have mastered my book. Master

my book and you will take over the

world.

DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

By now you should be laughing with

me.

TALIA

You digging what you see?

LARRY CROWNE

You missed Matsutani's class.

Review for the final.

TALIA

I'm done w th college.

LARRY CROWNE

What? Why?

TALIA

Because I'm going into business.

LARRY CROWNE

Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in

school. Don't throw away your

education.

TALIA

And don't drink and drive or do

drugs and quit smoking and eat

vegetables. I don't. I stopped.

I did. I do.

LARRY CROWNE

98.

TALIA

Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice

gave us free tattoos. I wanted

something in Japanese so check this

out.

TALIA (CONT'D)

That one says 'courage'. That one

says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit.

LARRY CROWNE

Japanese characters go the other

way and that says Soy Sauce.

TALIA

Oh shut up.

LARRY CROWNE

It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce.

Quitting school is for dopes.

TALIA

Be here for our Grand Opening!

LARRY CROWNE

Might not make it. I have finals!

OPEN SKY

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

This place anonymous enough?

MERCEDES TAINOT

As long as alcohol's out of my

grasp.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

They have good pie, they say.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Great. Sugar can replace tequila

in my bloodstream, my thighs, and

the folds in my neck.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP)

So. You're a mess.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Yep.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

You'd think leggy blondes like us

would be impervious, right?

PERRY

Ladies. Bring an appetite?

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

The mark of a restaurant is their

Key Lime pie.

PERRY

100.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

No Key Lime?

PERRY

Cream pies I got.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Boston Cream?

PERRY

Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady,

you're killing me here.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.

PERRY

Ma'am?

MERCEDES TAINOT

I'll have the French Toast.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

French Toast?

MERCEDES TAINOT

(on the menu)

Breakfast all day.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

You won't believe how far I fell on

the Hooch-o-meter.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

I have seen it happen a time or

two.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I kissed a boy.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

When, third grade?

MERCEDES TAINOT

One of my students.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

You Hoor.

(THEN)

Gimme the friggin' details! He's

not a minor is he?

101.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Older than me.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Hugh Hefner in your class? What

went down?

MERCEDES TAINOT

He sort of... rescued me. And...

he smelled nice.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

He a fireman who bakes bread?

MERCEDES TAINOT

I wanted to be kissed so asked if he

wanted to and he did.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Bold. Who is he?

KITCHEN

PERRY

You're slipping, Larry.

(THE TOAST)

Lady says it's not French Toast as

she knows it.

LARRY CROWNE

She's insane.

PERRY

Take it up with her.

PERRY (CONT'D)

No shouting, okay? This is a

family friendly establishment.

BOOTH

LARRY CROWNE

Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a

problem with your order?

MERCEDES TAINOT

102.

LARRY CROWNE

Mrs. Tainot.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

(TO MERCEDES)

The student of yours!?

MERCEDES TAINOT

This is Larry Crowne.

LARRY CROWNE

There's no way in creation I screw

up French Toast.

MERCEDES TAINOT

It was fine, actually.

(THEN)

I wanted to see if it was really

you cooking back there. And say,

howdy. Howdy doody.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Ready for the final?

LARRY CROWNE

You'll be the judge of that.

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

So, your meal is satisfactory?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Absolutely.

LARRY CROWNE

Would you let my boss know so I

don't lose this job?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Yes indeed.

LARRY CROWNE

Shall I prepare you another batch?

MERCEDES TAINOT

No. Thanks.

103.

LARRY CROWNE

Then I will return to my station..

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

You kissed the cook...

(THEN)

I got a whiff. He smelled like

bell pepper.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Look at the men in my life.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

Blame it on the booze... and

collect yourself.

(THEN)

You hoor...

MERCEDES TAINOT

That's my problem. I'm a drunken

hoor.

That ends... right now.

(THEN)

Check please?

KITCHEN

104.

CUT TO:

SUNRISE

MERCEDES TAINOT

What a difference from day one. I

must be a better teacher than I

thought.

(THEN)

Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris

stopped up-talking. Lala you can't

shut up. Mack spoke about

Australia for three minutes and

mentioned kangaroos only twice. And

Larry Crowne...

105.

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

I was tough on him. But he learned

fast. How he connected the Circle

of Sales to the expanding universe

is impressive as hell. I'll never

forget about the Value Index now.

He gave a perfect speech.

(THEN)

And... He's polite. Instead of

fighting me off that night, what

does he do but kisses me one and

then all but tucks me in. What kind

of guy does that to a loopy tramp

like me? He could have ravaged me.

I misread this guy and if I had a

brain I'd find a way to steal him

away from that cutie pie and keep

him for myself. I wonder if he'd

like that, if he would... What did

I just say?

(THEN)

What did I just say about Larry

Crowne?

DIBIASI

Nothing. And I was just wrapping

up here.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I'm so sorry. Please go on.

DIBIASI

Larry? It okay if I get to my

climax and denouement?

DIBIASI (CONT'D)

Thank you... If it was the romance

novelist in him that made Victoria

the Queen become such a pal, chalk

it up as another brick in the

legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of

Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime

Minister of Great Britain. Not bad

for a Jewish guy, huh?

106.

PINEDO

Not so much as a bump, Nomad!

Why'd you go last?

DIBIASI

Fourth quarter dramatics.

(THEN)

Not that it mattered to my Speech

professor...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Congratulations all of you.

MACK

Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we

vote?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Not me, I have to stay objective.

MACK

I say... Lala!

DR. MATSUTANI

The first to finish. No surprise.

107.

MACK

This is the last of them. Damn,

you have a lot of records.

LARRY CROWNE

Priceless at a buck apiece.

PATIENCE

A two-bedroom apartment and you

don't have room for your furniture?

LAMARR

Selling this futon-sofabed? All

those years across the street and

you've learned nothing.

(THEN)

What's the minimum you'll take for

this stuff?

LARRY CROWNE

You'll get me top price.

LAMARR

You did learn.

DIBIASI

Pizza at last!

LARRY CROWNE

Here's lunch as promised!

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

108.

STRANG

Son of a cock. Larry Crowne.

LARRY CROWNE

Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.

STRANG

Two extra large. One Salad Bucket.

Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen-

fifty.

LARRY CROWNE

Jack. I need two bucks back.

Times are tough.

STRANG

Tell me about it.

LARRY CROWNE

Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.

STRANG

I appreciate it.

That could have been

RAUL

My next wife just walked in.

PERRY

I love this business sometimes.

(GREETING MERCEDES)

Something told me you'd be back.

Is Larry Crowne working today?

KITCHEN

109.

PERRY

Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a

question about the menu.

RAUL

Go ahead. I'll take the window

even though I'm the boss of the

whole kitchen.

MERCEDES TAINOT

There's Larry Crowne. Are you

allowed to sit?

(HE DOES)

Where does Perry get his coffee?

LARRY CROWNE

I add chicory and a bit of vanilla.

Trick I picked up in the Navy.

MERCEDES TAINOT

You're probably wondering why I

stopped by. Well, it's to tell you

your grade for Speech 217. You

killed on the final and have an A.

Way to go!

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

Actually, everybody got an A, but

you got the special A where I tell

you in person.

LARRY CROWNE

Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs.

Tainot.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Class is out. Call me Mercedes.

Or Mercy, for short.

(THEN)

So. Just wanted to congratulate

you. Your girlfriend will be

thrilled.

LARRY CROWNE

110.

MERCEDES TAINOT

No. I meant the... never mind.

(THEN)

Which classes are you going to ace

next term?

LARRY CROWNE

This has turned into a full time

gig. Out of necessity.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I hope you continue your education.

Back at East City. You've made

such a good start.

LARRY CROWNE

I'll have to see.

MERCEDES TAINOT

I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM,

thank God. Who knows what I'll

hear with the extra sleep.

LARRY CROWNE

My first class in college ever.

And I get an A. Gotta be the

teacher.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Should get going.

(THEN)

You don't know anything about car

devices, do you?

LARRY CROWNE

Cars not much. Devices some.

GPS VOICE

Please enter your destination.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Oh be quiet.

111.

MERCEDES TAINOT

It is Hellspawn.

LARRY CROWNE

In my old job, I'd have steered you

to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie

interface is clumsy and the menu

needs too many inputs.

MERCEDES TAINOT

It was working fine. Then I think

I pressed too many buttons.

LARRY CROWNE

Ah. The Auto On Feature is

engaged. Menu. Select. Features.

Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes.

On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back.

Back. Back. Exit.

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

How long was this broken?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Seemed like years and years.

LARRY CROWNE

All better now. Should be able to

find your way.

LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

My Boss. Back to work.

(THEN)

Thanks for the good news...

112.

PERRY

Kimosabe, holding off til after

school to woo the teacher is the

move of a class act.

DIBIASI

(on his phone)

I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in

hot water with Professor Tai-bo...

MERCEDES TAINOT

Is Larry with you?

CALIMERIS

Um, no. Should we track him down

and drag him in here?

MERCEDES TAINOT

I... Seeing you all... I just

thought...

(THEN)

Choose a seat and lets get started!

113.

PINEDO

Carrying a torch for Larry til it

burns her hands...

BUSIK

All the excitement of first day of

term, I don't want to go back to my

empty apartment. Do you? I need a

drink and some talk and some wind-

down time. Don't you?

DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.)

Ms. Tainot?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Dr. M.

DR. MATSUTANI

Larry Crowne is taking six units

from me, devouring the material

like a starving man.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Larry's enrolled?

DR. MATSUTANI

He's continuing his education and

tells me it is because of you.

That your class changed his life.

MERCEDES TAINOT

Larry said that about me?

BUSIK

Oh yeah! I put that guy in your

class. So technically, I changed

his life.

MERCEDES TAINOT

He is a good student

114.

DR. MATSUTANI

And handy on a scooter.

(THEN)

Is there any chance you would

consider having drinks with an

older faculty peer who holds a PhD

in Economics?

MERCEDES TAINOT

Well, no. No offense Dr. M.

DR. MATSUTANI

The rumor is you are newly single

and I was just taking a shot.

MERCEDES TAINOT

News travels fast.

BUSIK

If you're going out, I'm not doing

anything.

DR. MATSUTANI

Have you ever been to Hooters?

BUSIK

For the spicy wings, yes!

GPS VOICE

Right Turn.

MERCEDES TAINOT

EXT. HARBOR BLVD. - LATER

Mercy is still in her robe, riding on Larry's scooter, back

and forth in front of the Parlor and Talia's store.

Larry is having coffee, sitting on the steps, watching her

ride back and forth.

She is getting good.

Talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her.

Hoots and laughter.

Larry uses his robe as a matador's cape, Mercy as the bull.

As she passes under his flaring cape...
