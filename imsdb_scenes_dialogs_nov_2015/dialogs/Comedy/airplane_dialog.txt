SHOOTING SCRIPT

June 11, 1979

Revised 6/15/79

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

The white zone is for immediate loading

and unloading of passengers only. There is

no stopping in the red zone.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

The red zone is for immediate loading and

unloading of passengers. There is no

stopping in the white zone.

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

No. The white zone is for loading and

unloading, and there is no stopping in the

red zone.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

The red zone has always been for loading

and unloading, and there is never stopping

in a white zone.

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

Don't tell me which zone is for stopping

and which zone is for loading.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

Listen, Betty. Don't start up with your

white zone shit again!

ZEALOT #1

Hello, we'd like you to have this flower

from the Religious Consciousness Church.

ELAINE

No, but thank you very much.

SHIRLEY

Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there

in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our

flight to Chicago.

JACK

Yeah, I think he is.

(waves)

Hey, Fred!

FRED

(yelling)

Hi, Jack!!!

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

There's just no stopping in the white

zone.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

Christ, you're as bad as your mother!

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

Oh, really, Vernon! Why pretend? We both

know perfectly well what it is you're

talking about. You want me to have an

abortion.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

It's really the only sensible thing to do.

If it's done properly, therapeutically,

there's no danger involved.

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

Have you considered that what's inside me

is a human being; that it's alive. We made

love. It's us -- you and me.

P.A. SYSTER (male v.o.)

That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is

not a human being, nor is it a person.

ZEALOT #2

Hello, we'd like you to have this flower

from the Church of Consciousness. Would

you like to make a donation?

KRISHNA

(shakes his head)

No, we gave at the office.

ELDERLY WOMAN

Go, O.J., go!!

SECURITY LADY

Please put your metal objects on this

tray.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

The red zone is for immediate loading and

unloading of passengers only. There is no

stopping in the white zone.

P. A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)

The red zone is for...Betty, put down that

gun!

P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)

The white zone is for immediate loading

and unloading of passengers only. There is

no stopping in the red zone.

BUSINESSMAN

Taxi!

STRIKER

Back in a minute.

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

Your attention, please. Flight seven-

thirty-three from Milwaukee is now

arriving on the B Concourse, Gate thirty-

five.

GROUND CREWMAN #2

Hey, Joe, where's the forklift?

GROUND CREWMAN #1

The forklift? It's over there by the

baggage loader.

STRIKER

Elaine!

ELAINE

(surprised)

Ted!

STRIKER

I came home early and found your note. I

guess you meant for me to read it later.

Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE

I just don't want to go over it any more.

STRIKER

I know things haven't been right for a

long time, but it'll be different. If

you'll just be patient, I can work things

out.

ELAINE

I have been patient and I've tried to

help, but you wouldn't even let me do

that.

STRIKER

Don't you feel anything for me at all any

more?

ELAINE

It takes so many things to make love last.

Most of all it takes respect. And I can't

live with a man I don't respect!

STRIKER

(to CAMERA)

What a pisser.

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

Captain Clarence Oveur, white courtesy

phone. Captain Clarence Oveur, white

courtesy phone.

OPERATOR (v.o.)

No, the white phone.

OVEUR

This is Captain Oveur.

OPERATOR (v.o.)

One moment for your call from the Mayo

Clinic.

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

Captain Clarence Oveur...

OVEUR

(yelling at ceiling)

I've got it!

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

All right. Thank you.

OPERATOR (v.o.)

Go ahead with your call.

TURNANSKY (v.o.)

This is Doctor Turnansky at the Mayo

Clinic.

TURNANSKY

There's a passenger on your Chicago flight

two-oh-niner, a little girl named Lisa

Davis -- en route to Minneapolis. She's

scheduled for a heart transplant and we'd

like you to tell her mother that we found

a donor an hour ago.

TURNANSKY

We have the heart here ready for surgery

and we must have the recipient on the

operating table within six hours.

TURNANSKY

I want you to make sure she is kept in a

reclined position and that a continuous

watch is kept on her I.V.

TURNANSKY (v.o.)

Also, it's important that...

OPERATOR (v.o.)

Excuse me. This is the Operator, Captain

Oveur, I have an emergency call for you on

line five trom a Mister Hamm.

OVEUR

All right. Give me Hamm on five, hold the

Mayo.

STRIKER

Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow

night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.

ELAINE

I won't be back. I've requested the

Atlanta run.

STRIKER

Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really

can change.

ELAINE

Then why don't you take the job that Louie

Netz offered you at Boeing?

STRIKER

You know I haven't been able to get near

an airplane since the war. And even if I

could, they wouldn't hire me because of my

war record.

ELAINE

Your war record? You're the only one

keeping that alive. For everyone else it's

ancient history.

STRIKER

You expect me to believe that?

ELAINE

It's the truth. What's hurt you the most

is your record since the war. Different

cities, different jobs, and not one of

them shows you can accept any real

responsibility.

STRIKER

But if you'll just give me...

ELAINE

It's too late, Ted. When I get back to

Chicago, I'm going to start my life all

over again. I'm sorry.

ZEALOT #3

Hello, we'd like you to have this...

BASTA

Any word on that storm lifting over Salt

Lake, Clarence?

OVEUR

Unlikely, Victor. I just reviewed the Area

Report for 1609 hours through 2400 hours.

That's an occluded front stalled over the

Dakotas -- backed up all the way to Utah.

BASTA

If it decides to push over into the Great

Lakes it could get plenty soupy. How about

the southern route, around Tulsa?

OVEUR

I double checked the terminal forecast and

winds aloft. IFR ceilings all the way.

BASTA

Where do they top out?

OVEUR

Well, there's some light scattered cover

at twenty thousand with icing around

eighteen.

BASTA

Looks like the original flight plan over

Denver is still the best bet.

OVEUR

Denver it is.

MURDOCK

Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report

shows everything socked in from Salt Lake

to Lincoln.

OVEUR

(to Murdock)

Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard.

Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

BASTA

How do you do, Roger?

HARI KRISHNA #1

Do you believe those goddamn Steelers? Can

you imagine blitzing on third and long

with two minutes in the game?

HARI KRISHNA #2

Well, hell, they couldn't stay in zone

coverage with Dallas running swing

patterns!

JACK

What did you think of 'Great

Expectations?'

SHIRLEY

Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

GIRL

Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.

SOLDIER

You promise you'll write.

GIRL

Every day.

AIRPORT STEWARD

Better get on board, son.

STRIKER

Can you tell me if Elaine Dickinson is on

this flight?

CHECK-IN LADY

Well, the whole flight crew has boarded.

Yes. She is on board.

STRIKER

I'd like one ticket to Chicago. No

baggage!

CHECK-IN LADY

Smoking or non-smoking?

STRIKER

Smoking, please.

BLACK DUDE #l

Shi',man, tha' honkey mo'fo' mess wi' my

ol' lady, man I rap tha' dude upside his

head, man.

BLACK DUDE #2

Yeah, man, he ain't never goin' come on

layin' no pig rap off you, man.

RANDY

Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your

right.

STRIKER

Thank you.

"NO SMOKING

EL NO A YOU SMOKO"

"FASTEN SEAT BELTS

PUTANA DA SEATBELTZ"

MRS. ELDERLY

Nervous?

STRIKER

Yes.

MRS. ELDERLY

First time?

STRIKER

No. I've been nervous lots of times. I

used to be a pilot myself...during the

war.

ELAINE

We'll be taking off real soon so we better

fasten you in tight.

LISA

Thank you. Oh Mother, this is so exciting.

MRS. DAVIS

I know, but remember you must get some

rest.

ELAINE

That's good advice. You relax and I'll be

back after we take off.

OVEUR

Two-zero-niner to ground control. We are

loaded and ready to taxi.

GROUND CONTROL (v.o.)

Roger, two-zero-niner. You are third in

line for takeoff...Air Israel, taxi into

position.

GROUND CONTROL (v.o.)

Air Poland, you are cleared for takeoff.

GROUND CONTROL (v.o.)

Taxi to runway one-niner.

SOLDIER

Good-bye, darling.

GIRL

Oh, good-bye, Bill! Have your picture

taken as soon as you get there and send me

one!

SOLDIER

I will.

GIRL

Don't you go getting fat or anything.

SOLDIER

Don't worry, I won't. Okay, here -- hurry!

GIRL

Oh, but it's your watch. You shouldn't.

You'll need it.

SOLDIER

Good-bye, darling.

GIRL

Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with

me all the time.

SOLDIER

So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of

yourself.

GIRL

Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.

SOLDIER

Good-bye, darling.

GIRL

Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you,

darling.

SOLDIER

Good-bye, darling.

GROUND CONTROLLER (v.o.)

Flight two-zero-niner, you are cleared for

takeoff.

OVEUR

Roger.

MURDOCK

(turning to Oveur)

Huh?

GROUND CONTROLLER (v.o.)

L.A. departure frequency two-point-niner.

OVEUR

Roger.

MURDOCK

(turning to Oveur)

Huh?

BASTA

(to tower)

Request vector...over.

OVEUR

(turning to Basta)

What?

GROUND CONTROLLER (v.o.)

Flight two-zero-niner, cleared for vector

three...two four.

MURDOCK

We have clearance, Clarence.

OVEUR

Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

BASTA (v.o.)

Tower radioed clearance, over.

OVEUR (v.o.)

That's Clarence Oveur...over.

BASTA (v.o.)

Roger.

MURDOCK (v.o.)

Huh?

TOWER (v.o.)

Roger, over.

OVEUR (v.o.)

What?!

MURDOCK (v.o.)

Huh?

RANDY

Do you feel all right, sir?

STRIKER

Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.

OVEUR (v.o.)

Good evening, this is Captain Oveur

speaking. We'll be cruising at thirty-six,

thousand feet, and arrival time in Chicago

is ten-forty-five Central Time. The

temperature there is sixty-two degrees,

with a twenty percent chance of

precipitation. And now here's Victor with

People in the news.

BASTA (v.o.)

Thank you, Clarence. Ali McGraw announced

another spin on the marriage-go-round. And

who's the lucky guy? You guessed it. None

other than Olympic gymnast...

ELAINE

Would you like something to read?

MRS. ELDERLY

Do you have anything light?

ELAINE

How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish

Sports Legends?'

MRS. ELDERLY

(taking pamphlet)

Yes. Thank you.

ELAINE

Ted, what are you doing here?

STRIKER

Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE

You...you shouldn't have come. I don't

have time now.

MRS. SCHIFF

Oh, stewardess...

ELAINE

Excuse me.

MRS. ELDERLY

No wonder you're upset. She's lovely. And

a darling figure. Supple, pouting breasts.

Firm thighs. It's a shame you're not

getting along.

STRIKER

Yes, I know. Things used to be different.

I remember when we first met. It was

during the war.

DISSOLVE TO:

STRIKER (v.o.)

I was in the Air Force, stationed in

Drambuie, on the Barbary Coast. I used to

hang out in the Magumba Bar.

STRIKER (v.o.)

It was a rough place. You would count on a

fight breaking out almost every night.

"E-5

MAKE ANOTHER SELECTION"

"B-17

MAKE ANOTHER SELECTION"

"A-12

THANK YOU"

STRIKER (v.o.)

I didn't go there that night to fall in

love, I just dropped in for a couple of

drinks.

STRIKER (v.o.)

But suddenly there she was.

STRIKER (v.o.)

I was captivated, entranced.

STRIKER (v.o.)

It hit me like a thunderbolt. I had to ask

the guy next to me to pinch me to make

sure I wasn't dreaming.

STRIKER (v.o.)

I was afraid to approach her, but that

night, fate was on my side.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

STRIKER

We laughed, we talked, we danced, I never

wanted it to end and I guess I still

don't. But enough about me. I hope this

hasn't been boring for you.

STRIKER

It's just that when I start to talk about

Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose

all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in

'Jesus: the Man.'

MILTON

I happened to be passing, and I thought

you might like some corfee.

BERNICE

That's very nice of you. Thank you.

BERNICE

Ah, won't you sit down?

MILTON

Thank you. Cream?

BERNICE

No, thank you. I take it black. Like my

men.

MILTON

Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?

BERNICE

Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You

see, I'm a teacher in the New York City

school system, and I was attending a

seminar on visual aids to education. Are

you from L.A.?

MILTON

No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a

lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's

Assocation.

ELAINE

Would you like to order dinner now?

MR. HAMMEN

Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will

have the fish.

JOEY

When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

MR. HAMMEN

Well, I think that the pilots are too busy

flying the plane for that, Joey.

JOEY

Aw, gee whiz.

ELAINE

I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the

Captain and see what I can arrange.

JOEY

Gee! That'd be swell!

ELAINE

Would you gentlemen care to order your

dinners?

BLACK DUDE #1

'Ey ma' muh fuh wha' fo', shi!

BLACK DUDE #2

Shi' mo cain ma foh mess wi' ain?!

RANDY

May I take your dinner order?

HARI KRISHNA #1

No, thank you, we brought our own

vegetables.

HARI KRISHNA #2

But we would like some hot water for our

tea, please.

HARI KRISHNA #1

Did you catch the jugs on that broad?

DISSOLVE TO:

ELAINE

Oh, Ted, I never knew I could be so happy.

These past few months have been wonderful.

Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast

to that little seafood place and...

ELAINE

What's the matter?

STRIKER

My orders came through. My squadron ships

out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very

important mission.

ELAINE

Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about

you so much.

STRIKER

I love you, Elaine.

ELAINE

I love you.

DISSOLVE TO:

GROUND CONTROL (v.o.)

Flight two-zero-niner, this is Denver

Flight Control. You're approaching some

rough weather. Please climb to forty-two

thousand feet.

OVEUR

Roger, Denver.

ELAINE

We have a visitor.

OVEUR

Hello.

MURDOCK

Hi.

ELAINE

This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and

Mister Johnson. This is Joey Hammen.

MURDOCK

Come on up here. You can see better.

OVEUR

Joey, here's something we give our special

visitors. Would you like to have it?

JOEY

Thank you. Thanks a lot!

OVEUR

Have you ever been in a cockpit before?

JOEY

No, sir. I've never been up in a plane

before.

OVEUR

Have you ever seen a grown man naked?

MURDOCK

Do you want me to check the weather,

Clarence?

OVEUR

(looking at Joey)

No, why don't you take care ot it?

ELAINE

We'd better get back now.

OVEUR

Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd

like to.

JOEY

Could I?

ELAINE

Okay, if you don't get in the way.

MURDOCK

Flight two-zero-niner to Denver radio.

Climbing to cruise at forty-two thousand.

Will report again over Lincoln. Over and

out.

JOEY

Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem

Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the

Los Angeles Lakers!

MURDOCK

I'm sorry, son, but you must have me

confused with someone else. My name is

Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.

MURDOCK

Ah, Victor, why don't you get the

coordinates on the altitude vector and

find out the ratio of direct velocity over

engine speed?

JOEY

You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My

Dad's got season tickets!

MURDOCK

I think you should go back to your seat

now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

OVEUR

No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him

stay up here.

MURDOCK

All right. But just remember, my name is

Roger Murdock.

MURDOCK

I'm an airline pilot.

(to Oveur)

Ah, Clarence, according to my

calculations, with this tailwind we ought

to be able to make up an additional

fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

JOEY

I think you're the greatest. But my Dad

says you don't work hard enough on

defense.

MURDOCK

(into microphone)

Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero-

niner intersecting Victor Airway seven-

niner-niner.

JOEY

...and that lots of times you don't even

run down court.

MURDOCK

We are turning left to a heading of zero-

niner-niner.

JOEY

...and that you don't really try, except

during the playoffs.

MURDOCK

The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my

buns every night.

MURDOCK

Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap

ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old

man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down

the court for forty-eight minutes.

(into mike)

Ah...Denver Control, this is Flight two-

zero-niner continuing on a heading two-

niner-niner...niner, ah...niner...niner.

STRIKER

Elaine, just hear me out. I know things

haven't been right for a long time. But it

will be different...like it was in the

beginning. Remember?

ELAINE

I remember everything. All I have are

memories.

ELAINE

Mostly I remember...the nights when we

were together. I remember how you used to

hold me...and how I used to sit on your

face and wriggle...and then afterwards how

we'd watch until the sun came up. When it

did, it was almost like...like each new

day was created...only for us.

STRIKER

That's the way I've always wanted it to

be, Elaine.

ELAINE

But it won't be. Not as long as you insist

on living in the past!

SUPERIMPOSE:

SQUADRON LEADER (v.o.)

You're too low, Ted! You're too low!

DISSOLVE TO:

U.S. ARMY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

PENTATHOL AVAILABLE

Master Charge, Visa, Carte Blanche

DISSOLVE TO:

ELAINE

You got a telegram from headquarters

today.

STRIKER

Headquarters!? What is it?

ELAINE

It's a big building where the generals

meet. But that's not important right now.

They've cleared you of any blame for what

happened on that raid. Isn't that good

news?

STRIKER

Is it? Because of my mistake six men

didn't return from that raid.

ELAINE

Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning.

Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in

a week. Isn't that wonderful?

STRIKER

I wish I could say the same for George

Zipp.

ELAINE

Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get

over this immediately.

SGT. McCOBB (o.s.)

Hey, Striker!

SGT. McCOBB

How about a break? I'm getting tired!

STRIKER

All right. Take five.

ELAINE

I found a wonderful apartment for us. It's

got a brick fireplace and a cute little

bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling.

And...

CAPTAIN GELINE (o.s.)

I'm off course. Red Leader!!! Look out!!

STRIKER

That's Captain Geline. He thinks he's a

pilot, still fighting the war.

LIEUTENANT HURWITZ (o.s.)

Groan.

ELAINE

What's his problem?

STRIKER

That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell

shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

DISSOLVE TO:

RANDY

Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee

before we serve dinner?

STRIKER

No. No thank you.

RANDY

Would either of you like another cup of

coffee?

MRS. HAMMEN

I will, but Jim won't.

MR. HAMMEN

Yes, I think I will have another cup of

coffee.

MRS. HAMMEN'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

Jim never has a second cup of coffee at

home.

RANDY

Excuse me, Sister?

SISTER ANGELINA

Yes?

RANDY

There's a little girl on board who's ill

and...

SISTER ANGELINA

Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.

RANDY

Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I

might be able to cheer her up.

SISTER ANGELINA

Of course.

RANDY

Is it all right if I talk to your

daughter?

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, I think that would be nice.

RANDY

(to Lisa, who is reading)

Hi!

LISA

Hi!

RANDY

I'm Randy.

LISA

I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

RANDY

I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.

LISA

Oh, I'd love to.

RANDY

Okay, this is one of my favorites.

RANDY

(strumming and singing in

ballad tempo)

'I've traveled the banks of the River

Jordan, to find where it flows to the

sea.'

RANDY

'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the

hungry and saw that I was looking at me.'

RANDY

(singing and playing the

guitar)

'And I wanted to know if life had a

purpose, and what it all means in the end.

In the silence I listened to the voices

inside me, and they told me again and

again.'

RANDY

'There is only one river. There is only

one sea.'

RANDY

'And it flows through you, and it flows

through me. There is only one people, we

are one and the same.'

RANDY

(still singing)

'We are all one spirit, one name. We are

the Father, we are the son.'

RANDY

'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.'

RANDY & PASSENGERS

'We are only one people, we are one and

the same.'

RANDY & PASSENGERS

'We are all one spirit on Earth, one

name.'

RANDY & PASSENGERS (v.o.)

'We are the Father, we are the son, and in

the Dawn of Creation we are one.'

OVEUR

Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little

bit late tonight.

ELAINE

Who wants to be first?

MURDOCK

Go ahead, Clarence, I got it.

ELAINE

How's the weather?

MURDOCK

Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff

ahead of us. It might get rough again

unless we can climb on top. But our

airspeed is holding steady at six hundred

ten knots.

ELAINE

That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen

asked me if you would autograph this

basketball.

STRIKER

After the war, I just wanted to get as far

away from things as possible. So Elaine

and I joined the Peace Corps. We were

assigned to an isolated tribe, the

Molombos.

DISSOLVE TO:

STRIKER (v.o.)

They had never seen Americans before.

STRIKER (v.o.)

At first, they didn't know what to think

of us; but soon we gained their trust.

STRIKER (v.o.)

It really was a challenge during the year

introducing them to our Western culture.

DISSOLVE TO:

ELAINE

Also, Supperware products are ideal for

storing leftovers to help stretch your

food dollar. This two quart "Seals-M-Rite"

container with a special "Close-M-Tite"

lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and

prevents sugared cereals from sticking.

ELAINE

Meat and dairy products are protected

against unwanted refrigerator odors when

sealed in this non-slip pastel colored

"Freez-o-leer".

STRIKER (v.o.)

You must understand that these people had

been completely isolated from

civilization.

STRIKER (v.o.)

No one had ever outlined a physical

fitness program for them and they had no

athletic equipment.

STRIKER (v.o.)

We also emphasized nutrition and taught

them to watch their diets.

STRIKER (v.o.)

The exercise improved their physical

fitness and condition.

STRIKER (v.o.)

My working with them seemed to reinforce

our objectives of group cooperation and

controlled-competitive activity.

STRIKER

I think they're getting the hang of it!

When we re-enlist I'll teach them

baseball!

ELAINE

Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time

for us to go back home -- to the plans we

made before the war.

STRIKER

A lot of people made plans before the war.

Like George Zipp.

STRIKER (v.o.)

I guess it was at that moment that I first

realized Elaine had doubts about our

relationship. And that as much as anything

else led to my drinking problem.

DISSOLVE TO:

STRIKER

We did come back to the States. I tried a

number of jobs...Well, I could go on for

hours, but I'd probably start to bore you.

STRIKER

You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

She wanted a career. I was offered a job

at Boeing but I couldn't bring myself to

take it...

SHIRLEY

Oh, I can't stand it.

JACK

What is it?

ELAINE

Yes?

SHIRLEY

My, stomach. I haven't felt this awful

since we saw that Lina Wertmuller film.

ELAINE

I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.

SHIRLEY

OOOOOO.

ELAINE

Captain, one of the women passengers is

very sick.

OVEUR

Airsick?

ELAINE

I think so, but I've never seen it so

acute.

OVEUR

Find out if there's a doctor on board, as

quietly as you can.

OVEUR

Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish

prison?

MR. HAMMEN

(nauseous)

Oooh, I shouldn't have had that second cup

of coffee.

MRS. HAMMEN'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

Jim never vomits at home.

ELAINE

I'm sorry I had to wake you. I'm just

looking for a doctor. There's nothing to

worry about.

MRS. YAFFE

Stewardess, I think the man next to me is

a doctor.

ELAINE

Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to

wake you. Are you a doctor?

DR. RUMACK

That's right.

ELAINE

We have some passengers who are very sick.

Could you come and take a look at them?

DR. RUMACK

Yes. Yes, of course.

DR. RUMACK

Pain there?

DR. RUMACK

May I see your tongue, please?

DR. RUMACK

I'll be back in a minute.

DR. RUMACK

You'd better tell the Captain. We've got

to land as soon as we can. This woman has

to be gotten to a hospital.

ELAINE

A hospital? What is it?

DR. RUMACK

It's a big building with patients. But

that's not important right now. Tell the

Captain I must speak to him.

ELAINE

Certainly.

OVEUR

(into mike)

Thank you, Omaha. Two-zero-niner out.

(to Basta)

Victor, we're running into a heavy storm,

can you...

OVEUR

Victor! Roger, take over!

DR. RUMACK

Captain, how soon can we land?

OVEUR

I can't tell.

DR. ROMACK

You can tell me. I'm a doctor!

OVEUR

No. I mean I'm just not sure.

DR. RUMACK

Can't you take a guess?

OVEUR

Well...not for another two hours.

DR. RUMACK

You can't take a guess for another two

hours?

OVEUR

No, I mean we can't land for another two

hours. Fog has closed down everything this

side of the mountains. We've got to go

through to Chicago!

OVEUR

(excitedly)

Get him out of there!

OVEUR

What is it, Doctor? What's happening?

DR. RUMACK

I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like

this since the Lina Wertmuller Film

Festival.

DR. RUMACK

What was it we had for dinner tonight?

ELAINE

Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

DR. RUMACK

Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.

DR. RUMACK

What did he have?

ELAINE

He had fish.

RANDY

We have two more sick people, and the rest

of the passengers are worried.

OVEUR

I'll take care of the passengers. Elaine,

find out what the two sick people had for

dinner.

(into P.A.)

This is Captain Oveur speaking.

OVEUR (v.o.)

It's been a little bumpy up here but we'll

be past it in a few minutes.

OVEUR (v.o.)

A couple points of interest: we're just

now passing over the Hoover Dam and later

on, our course will take us just south of

the Grand Canyon.

OVEUR

Meanwhile, relax and enjoy the rest of

your flight. Okay? Okay!

OVEUR

That should do it.

OVEUR

(into microphone)

Chicago, this is flight two-zero-niner.

We're in trouble.

OVEUR (v.o.)

We've got to have all altitudes below us

cleared and priority approach and landing

in Chicago. Over.

DISPATCHER

We read you. Stand by, two-zero-niner.

RANDY

Yes?

MRS. HAMMEN

Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick.

Can you do something, please?

RANDY

Well, the doctor will be with you in just

a moment. One thing: do you know what he

had for dinner?

MRS. HAMMEN

Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

RANDY

Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about.

We'll get back to you very quickly.

ELAINE

Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And

Randy says there are five more cases, and

they ate fish, too.

DR. RUMACK

Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What

did the navigator eat?

ELAINE

He had fish, too.

DR. RUMACK

All right, now we know what we're up

against. Every passenger on this plane who

ate fish for dinner will become violently

ill within the next half hour.

ELAINE

Just how serious is it, doctor?

DR. RUMACK

Extremely serious. It starts with a slight

fever.

DR. RUMACK

Then a dryness in the throat. As the virus

penetrates the red blood cells the victim

becomes dizzy and begins to experience a

rash and itching. From there the poison

works its way into the central nervous

system causing severe muscle spasms,

followed by the inevitable drooling. At

this point, the entire digestive system is

rendered useless, causing the complete

collapse of the lower bowels, accompanied

by uncontrollable flatulence...until

finally the poor bastard is reduced to a

quivering, wasted piece of jelly.

OVEUR

(gasping)

Turn...on...automatic pilot.

ELAINE

Uh, automatic pilot...automatic pilot?

ELAINE

There it is!

DR. RUMACK

I'll get back to the passengers.

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

(over radio)

Come in two-zero-niner. This is Chicago.

Flight two-zero-niner, come in, please.

ELAINE

This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the

stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on

the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and

navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble.

Over.

OVEUR (o.s.)

Groan!

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Elaine! Roger, Roger! I read you. This is

Steve McCroskey at Chicago Air Control.

ELAINE

Hi, Steve!

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Now listen carefully. Is the automatic

pilot on? Over.

ELAINE

Yes. Yes, it is. Over.

OVEUR (o.s.)

Huh?

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Very good. Now, Elaine, where are you?

Over.

ELAINE

I'm standing over Oveur. Over.

McCROSKEY

(into mike)

All right, Elaine. Just hold on. We'll be

back to you in a minute.

McCROSKEY

Hold all takeoffs. I don't want another

plane in the air. When the 508 reports,

bring it straight in.

McCROSKEY

Put out a general bulletin to suspend all

meal service on flights out of Los

Angeles.

McCROSKEY

Tell all dispatchers to remain at their

posts. It's going to be a long night.

McCROSKEY

And how about some coffee, Johnny?

HINSHAW

No thanks.

McCROSKEY

I want the weather on every landing field

on this side of the Rockies, no matter

what the size.

McCROSKEY

Do you understand?

McCROSKEY

Any place where there's a chance to land

this plane.

McCROSKEY

Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a

runway diagram. Terry, check down on the

field for emergency equipment.

AIR CONTROLLER #1

Chief, there's fog down to the deck

everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no

possible place they can land. They'll have

to come through to Chicago.

McCROSKEY

Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit

smoking.

McCROSKEY

I want the best available man on this. A

man who knows this plane inside and out

and won't crack under pressure.

HINSHAW

How about Sal Mineo?

McCROSKEY

Get me Rex Kramer!

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is

the air speed gauge. What speed does it

indicate?

ELAINE

Three hundred twenty miles per hour.

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Good. Now check your altitude. That's the

dial just below and to the right of the

air speed indicator.

ELAINE

Thirty-five thousand feet.

ELAINE

No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand

feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast!

Why is it doing that?

ELAINE

Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's

deflating!

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

All right, Elaine, don't worry. We have an

auxiliary inflation system. Just follow my

instructions.

ELAINE

Okay, but please hurry! We're dropping

fast!

DR. RUMACK

What the hell's going on up there?

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Now, Elaine, don't panic. On the belt line

of the automatie pilot there is a hollow

tube. Can you see that?

ELAINE

Yes. Yes, I can see it.

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Good. Now that's the manual inflation

nozzle. Pull it out and blow it up like a

balloon.

DR. RUMACK

Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can

you face some unpleasant facts?

ELAINE

No.

DR. RUMACK

All right. Unless I can get all these

people to a hospital quickly, I can't even

be sure of saving their lives. Now, is

there anyone else on board who can land

this plane?

ELAINE

Well...

ELAINE

No. No one that I know of.

DR. RUMACK

I think you ought to know what our chances

are. The life of everyone on board depends

on just one thing: finding someone back

there who not only can fly this plane, but

who didn't have fish for dinner.

ELAINE (v.o.)

Ladies and gentlemen, this is your

stewardess speaking. We regret any

inconvenience the sudden cabin movement

might have caused.

ELAINE (v.o.)

This is due to periodic air pockets we

encounter. There is no reason to become

alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of

your flight. By the way, is there anyone

on board who knows how to fly a plane?

CAREY

Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline.

I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER

Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right

out.

MRS. KRAMER

Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've

got a real emergency down there.

CAREY

(holding off dog)

Well, to tell the truth, they really

didn't fill me in on many of the details.

Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER

Something about a plane with no pilot?

CAREY

Yeah, something like that, but as I say,

they didn't have time to tell me very

much.

MRS. KRAMER

Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting

things happen all the time down there.

CAREY

Well...the airline business...does have...

its moments...

CAREY

...but after...awhile...you begin to...

(gasp)

...get used to it.

MRS. KRAMER

Shep, no! He gets so excited when new

people are here.

MRS. KRAMER

Are you a pilot yourself?

CAREY

I'm...in a...argh...navigator training

program.

KRAMER

It's unbelievable! How many times have I

warned those people about food inspection?

KRAMER

The airport management, the F.A.A., and

the airlines, they're all cheats and

liars! All right, let's get out of here.

RANDY

Sorry to bother you. We were just looking

for someone with flying experience.

HARI KRISHNA #1

Hari Rama?

HARI KRISHNA #2

Rama Rama.

STRIKER

You see, the day we left the village it

was raining, so we had to take a special

jeep to the main road...

STRIKER

In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep

since just the day before the only one we

had broke down -- it had a bad axle...

RANDY

Excuse me, sir. There's been a little

problem in the cockpit and I was

wondering...

STRIKER

The cockpit? What is it?

RANDY

It's the little room at the front of the

plane where the pilots sit. But that's not

important right now. The first officer is

ill and the Captain would like someone

with flying experience to help him with

the radio. Do you know anything about

planes?

STRIKER

Well, I flew in the war, but that was a

long time ago. I wouldn't know anything

about it.

RANDY

Would you go up, please?

JACK

Would ya like a little whiskey, ma'am?

SPINSTER

(insulted)

Certainly not.

STRIKER

(to Rumack and Randy)

The stewardess said...

STRIKER

Both pilots!

DR. RUMACK

Can you fly this airplane and land it?

STRIKER

Surely you can't be serious.

DR. RUMACK

I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!

What flying experience have you had?

STRIKER

Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the

Air Force, but this plane has four

engines. It's an entirely different kind

of flying...all together!!!

RANDY/RUMACK

(all together)

It's an entirely different kind of flying.

STRIKER

Besides, I haven't touched any kind of

plane in six years.

DR. RUMACK

Mister Striker. I know nothing about

flying. All I know is this: you're the

only person on this plane who can possibly

fly it. You're the only chance we've got.

McCROSKEY

(to Air Controller)

Tell Omaha to acknowledge and standby.

(into phone)

Get every piece of emergency equipment you

can reach.

(to Air Controller)

Alert at every mile of the way from here

to the mountains.

HINSHAW

Would anyone care for a roll and coffee?

AIR CONTROLLER #2

Chief?

McCROSKEY

We'll need a pre-landing flight check.

Tell 'em I'm in the dispatch office and I

want it here fast.

AIR CONTROLLER #2

It's your wife.

McCROSKEY

(into phone)

I want the kids in bed by nine. I want the

dog fed, the yard watered, and the gate

locked. And get a note to the milkman --

no more cheese!

McCROSKEY

Where the hell is Kramer?

KRAMER

(into phone)

No, we can't do that; the risk of a

flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000.

No, feet!

KRAMER

One of the passengers is going to land

that plane.

CAREY

Is that possible?

KRAMER

Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot.

Thousand to one. I know this guy.

CAREY

You do? Who is it?

KRAMER

His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him

during the war. And that won't make my job

any easier tonight.

KRAMER

Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up

to a point. But he was one of those men

who, well, let's just say he felt too much

inside. Maybe you know the kind.

KRAMER

It takes a certain type to perform under

pressure. Striker didn't have it.

KRAMER

Ate his heart out over every name on the

casualty lists. The upshot of it is that

he went all to pieces on one particular

mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen

again tonight.

STRIKER

Let's see, altitude twenty-four thousand

feet, level flight, air speed four hundred

sixty knots, course zero niner zero, trim,

mixture, landing gear, balance.

ELAINE

Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly

this plane!

STRIKER

That's what I've been trying to tell these

people.

DR. RUMACK

Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently,

so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on

this plane is in a desperate situation.

Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.

STRIKER

Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the

thrust, this must turn on the landing

lights.

GOBACKEN SIDONNA

STRIKER

(into mike)

Mayday!

STRIKER (v.o.)

Mayday! Mayday!

McCROSKEY

(surprised)

Mayday? What the hell is that for?

HINSHAW

It's the Russian New Year! We'll have a

parade! They'll serve hot hors d'oeuvres!

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

Two-zero-niner, are you okay up there?

STRIKER

Yeah, I was just trying out the landing

lights.

MRS. HAMMEN

I've got to get out of here! I can't stand

it! I've got to get out of here!

RANDY

Calm down. Get hold of yourself!

JACK

Stewardess, let me handle this.

JACK

Get hold of yourself! Get hold of

yourself!

DR. RUMACK

(to Jack)

Get back to your seat; I'll take care of

this.

DR. RUMACK

Calm down. Calm down. Get hold of

yourself!

SISTER ANGELINA

(to Rumack)

Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

SISTER ANGELINA

Everything will be all right. Please get

hold of yourself.

OVER 16 BILLION PLANES LANDED

P.A. #1 (v.o.)

Your attention, please. Flight four-one-

seven now departing the B Concourse, gate

six.

P.A. #2 (v.o.)

Your attention, please. Flight twenty-

seven now arriving the B Concourse, gate

six.

AIR CONTROLLER #1

(into phone)

This guy doing the flying has no airline

experience at all. He'll be a menace to

himself and everything else in the air...

(he pauses to listen)

...Yes, birds too.

McCROSKEY

(into phone)

Okay, okay. He's a terrible risk, but what

other choice have we got?

McCROSKEY

Well, that's the whole story, Rex,

everything we know.

KRAMER

All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

KRAMER

As you know, I flew with this man,

Striker, during the war. He'll have enough

on his mind without remembering those days

when -- well, when things weren't so good.

McCROSKEY

Well, right now things aren't so good. And

while we're talking there are a hundred

and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a

decision.

KRAMER

Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker

was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long

time ago...

KRAMER

...but my feeling is that when the going

gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's

gonna fold up.

McCROSKEY

Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn

and talk this guy down! You're going to

have to let him get the feel of this

airplane on the way; you'll have to talk

him onto the approach; and so help me,

you'll have to talk him right down to the

ground!

KRAMER

Very well then. Put Striker on the

speaker.

McCROSKEY

Okay, you can use the radio over there.

Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit

drinking.

KRAMER

Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex

Kramer speaking.

STRIKER

(dramatically)

Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and

clear.

KRAMER

All right. It's obvious you remember me.

KRAMER

So what do you say you and I just forget

about everything except what we have to do

now?

KRAMER

You and I are going to bring this plane in

together.

KRAMER

Before we start, I'd like to say

something. I know that right now things

must look pretty rough up there.

KRAMER

But if you do what I tell you, when I tell

you to do it, there's no reason you can't

bring that plane in.

STRIKER

Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know

I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm

going to need all the luck there is.

KRAMER

Stand by, Striker.

(to McCroskey)

The one hope we have is to build this man

up. I've got to give him all the

confidence I can.

(into microphone)

All right, Striker, have you ever flown a

multi-engine plane before?

STRIKER (v.o.)

No. Never.

KRAMER

Shit!

KRAMER (v.o.)

This is a goddamn waste of time. There's

no way he can land this plane! Route 'em

into Lake Michigan and at least avoid

killing innocent people!

McCROSKEY

Grab hold of yourself! You've got to talk

them down. You're the only chance they've

got!

KRAMER

(into mike)

All right, Striker, now you listen to me

and you listen close. Flying is no

different than riding a bicycle...it just

happens to be a lot harder to put baseball

cards in the spokes. Now, if you just

follow my instructions...

KRAMER (v.o.)

...there's no reason why you shouldn't

have complete confidence in your chances

to come out of this thing alive and in one

piece.

KRAMER

First, I want you to familiarize yourself

with the controls. Later we'll run through

the landing procedure.

KRAMER

All right. Now I'd like you to disengage

the automatic pilot. But watch any violent

movement of the controls, like you used to

make in Spitfires and Phantoms.

STRIKER

(into microphone)

Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic

pilot.

KRAMER (v.o.)

(matter of factly)

Just remember, the controls will feel very

heavy compared to a fighter.

KRAMER (v.o.)

Don't worry about that. It's perfectly

normal. You must watch your airspeed

closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both

your rudder pedals and elevator trim will

have additional play due to increased

drag, but you can compensate by lowering

manifold pressure below 154. Now there's

one other thing. Have you someone up there

who can work the radio and leave you free

for flying?

STRIKER

Yes! The stewardess is here with me!

KRAMER (v.o.)

Have her take the co-pilot's seat.

STRIKER

The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye

on that number three engine. It's running

a little hot.

KRAMER (v.o.)

Striker, what kind of weather are you in

up there?

ELAINE

(into microphone)

Rain.

STRIKER

And a little ice.

ELAINE

And a little ice!

KRAMER (v.o.)

How's it handling?

STRIKER

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

ELAINE

(into microphone)

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

KRAMER (v.o.)

(patronizing)

All right, Striker, you're doing just

fine.

STRIKER

(to Elaine)

It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how

much I hate his guts.

ELAINE

(into microphone)

It's a damn good thing you don't know how

much he hates your guts.

BLACK DUDE

Oooooooh.

RANDY

Can I get something for you?

BLACK DUDE

Cain fo' gwine sho fi cun for.

RANDY

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

MRS. SCHIFF

Oh, stewardess, I can speak jive. He said

he's in great pain and wants to know if

you can help him.

RANDY

Tell him to relax and I'll be back as

quickly as I can with some medicine.

MRS. SCHIFF

Shi gwine man chitlun down for mo sho.

BLACK DUDE

(indignantly)

Shi man I ain neba mo fo gwine ain.

SISTER ANGELINA

'...I sit by the telephone for hours. I

love when men send me flowers. I enjoy

being a girl.'

JACK

How ya doing, honey?

SHIRLEY

Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.

JACK

Here.

MILTON

After my wife died, I felt like a fifth

wheel. You know, so many years being with

one person -- a very wonderful person --

makes you always think of yourself as part

of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was

lost. I couldn't function socially and I

couldn't function in business.

BERNICE

Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't

be expected to.

MILTON

But I think it's time we stopped talking

about me. A woman like you -- why haven't

you ever married?

BERNICE

Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's

all too easy to answer.

MILTON

I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman

like you became so involved in your work,

you didn't have time for marriage.

BERNICE

I wish I could fool myself into believing

that that's the reason. The truth of the

matter is, nobody ever asked me.

MILTON

You know, here we are having coffee

together, and discussing education and

business and economy...and we don't even

know each other's names...full names I

mean.

BERNICE

Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

MILTON

That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt

Ettenhenim. But my friends call me

'Bubbles.'

RANDY

Would you care for a soft drink?

MRS. SCHIFF

I'd be glad to.

MRS. SCHIFF

Ooooh, such a nice soft drink.

RADIO (v.o.)

National Weather Service reporting Omaha

fogged in. Visibility zero.

McCROSKEY

(to Air Controller #2)

Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife on the

phone. We'd better let her know what's going on.

AIR CONTROLLER #1

Steve, this weather bulletin just came off

the wire.

McCROSKEY

Johnny, what can you make out of this?

HINSHAW

This? Why, I could make a hat or a

broach...

MRS. OVEUR

Hello?

AIR CONTROLLER #2 (v.o.)

Missus Oveur?

MRS. OVEUR

Yes, this is Missus Oveur.

AIR CONTROLLER #2 (v.o.)

This is Ed Macias calling from the

airport. There's some trouble on your

husband's flight.

AIR CONTROLLER #2 (v.o.)

We don't know how serious it is yet, but

Harry Ballard thought you'd want to get

down here right away.

MRS. OVEUR

I'll be right down.

MRS. OVEUR

I've got to go to the airport. You can let

yourself out the back door. There's juice

in the refrigerator.

HORSE

(sounding like Mr. Ed)

Did you finish? Was I good?

MRS. OVEUR

Oh, you're all so concerned about

performance!

RANDY

Would you care for another drink?

MRS. SCHIFF

No, thank you, I'm still nursing this one.

MRS. SCHIFF

(to bottle)

There, just a little bit more -- and then

burpie time and a good nap!

ELAINE

Doctor Rumack says the sick people are

getting worse and we're running out of

time.

STRIKER'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

(echoing)

I've got to concentrate, concentrate,

entrate, I've got to concentrate,

oncentrate, oncentrate.

STRIKER'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

(echoing)

Hell, hello, ello, ello, ello, lo, lo.

Echo, echo, echo, cho, cho, o, o, o, o, o.

Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone, Manny

Mota, Mota, Mota, Mota.

ELAINE (v.o.)

(hysterically)

Ted, the altitude! We're falling, we're

falling!

JACK

(to Rumack)

What's going on? We have a right to know

the truth!

DR. RUMACK

(to passengers)

All right. I'm going to level with you.

The most important thing now is that you

should all be calm, because there's no

reason to panic.

DR. RUMACK

Now, it is true that one of the flight

crew has been taken ill...slightly ill.

DR. RUMACK

But the other two pilots are just fine and

at the controls flying the plane.

DR. RUMACK

The weather in Chicago is clear as a bell,

and there's no reason that we won't land

on schedule...

DR. RUMACK

...safe and sound and free to pursue a

life of religious fulfillment.

STRIKER

(into microphone)

Chicago, the passengers are beginning to

panic. When do we start down?

KRAMER

(into microphone)

Not just yet, we'll have you in radar

range any second now.

KRAMER

(to McCroskey)

I don't understand it. He should have been

in range ten minutes ago.

McCROSKEY

(into microphone)

Gunderson, check the radar range. Anything

yet?

GUNDERSON

(into microphone)

About two more minutes, Chief.

McCROSKEY

Two more minutes! They could be miles off

course.

KRAMER

That's impossible. They're on instruments!

KRAMER

This is gonna be a real sweat.

(into mike)

Gunderson, let me know when you get

anything.

McCROSKEY

I can't take much more of this! Johnny,

how about some more coffee?

HINSHAW

Would you like half of my provolone and

roast beef?

McCROSKEY

Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit

amphetamines.

AIR CONTROLLER #1

(to McCroskey)

Steve, these reporters won't leave without

a statement.

REPORTER #1

How much longer can the sick passengers

hold out?

McCROSKEY

Half hour...maybe forty-five minutes.

REPORTER #2

Who's flying the plane?

McCROSKEY

One of the passengers. But he's an

experienced air force pilot who flew

during the war so there's no cause for

alarm. Hinshaw, take over.

REPORTER #3

Have the families been notified?

HINSHAW

I think Florence Henderson knows about it!

REPORTER #1

What are the chances of bringing this

plane in safely?

HINSHAW

What are the chances of returning

something to Montgomery Ward the week

after Christmas?

REPORTER #1

(beckoning to door)

All right, boys. Let's get some pictures.

JACK KILPATRICK

Shana, they bought their tickets, they

knew what they were getting into. I say,

let 'em crash!

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. RUMACK

Will the hospital equipment be at the

airport?

STRIKER

Yes, everything they've got. How are the

passengers doing?

DR. RUMACK

I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're

running out of time.

STRIKER

Surely there must be something you can do.

DR. RUMACK

I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop

calling me Shirley!

STRIKER'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

I've got to stay calm. If I can just keep

my wits about me, I can't mess this one

up.

ELAINE'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

Maybe I have been too harsh with him. If I

had given him more support in the

beginning, maybe things would be

different.

STRIKER'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

Forget it. It's not your fault.

ELAINE'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

That's sweet of you, Ted. I appreciate the

thought.

STRIKER'S                        ELAINE'S

THOUGHTS (v.o.)                  THOUGHTS (v.o.)

STRIKER'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

Go ahead.

ELAINE'S THOUGHTS (v.o.)

No, no. You were first.

MRS. HAMMEN

(hysterically)

He's dead. He's dead!

JACK

No, I'm not dead.

SISTER ANGELINA

'What you want,

Baby I got,

What you need,

You know I got it.

All I'm askin' for

Is a little respect

When you come home.'

DR. RUMACK

Randy, are you all right?

RANDY

Doctor Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been

so scared. And besides, I'm twenty-six and

I'm not married.

DR. RUMACK

Randy, we're going to make it. You've got

to believe that.

MRS. HAMMEN

Lorison, do you have any idea when we'll

be landing?

DR. RUMACK

It will be pretty soon. How are you

bearing up?

MRS. HAMMEN

Well, to be honest, I'm very scared. But

at least I've got a husband.

RADIO (v.o.)

National Weather Service reporting Chicago

ceiling zero, visibility one hundred feet.

DISPATCHER

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

McCROSKEY

Rex, I've decided that the best thing to

do is to foam the runway -- let him do a

wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler.

KRAMER

(filling up another cup)

No, the risk of fire is too great. If she

starts burning, you write off all those

people who can't get out of there on their

own power.

McCROSKEY

(filling up another cup)

Well that's better than writing them all

off? Are you going to play God with a

hundred and 38 lives?

KRAMER

(filling up another cup)

No. A belly landing isn't all that simple.

It takes a good pilot to keep from

smearin' himself all over the runway.

McCROSKEY

(filling up another cup)

If Striker has the guts to try this, he

deserves the best shot we can give him.

We've gotta foam that runway.

KRAMER

(taking another cup)

His only shot's with the wheels down. I've

seen foam tear a man's guts out.

McCROSKEY

And if Striker goes to pieces?

KRAMER

(taking another cup)

That's a risk we'll just have to take.

VOICE (v.o.)

Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.

Target should be clear it you go in low

enough. You'll have to decide.

(echoing)

You'll have to decide. You'll have to

decide...So, decide already.

STRIKER

Rats! I've lost number three.

ELAINE

What happened, Ted? What went wrong?

STRIKER

Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil

pressure. When Kramer hears about this,

the shit's gonna hit the fan.

KRAMER

I told him to watch that oil temperature.

What the hell's he doing up there?

KRAMER

Striker, that plane can't land itself! It

takes a pilot who can handle pressure.

McCROSKEY

Ease up, Rex! He hasn't flown for years!

It's not his fault. It could happen to any

pilot.

HINSHAW

It happened to Barbara Stanwyck!

STRIKER

He's right. I can't take the pressure. I

was crazy to think I could land this

plane.

ELAINE

But Ted, you're the only...

STRIKER

I don't care. I just don't have what it

takes. They'd be better off with someone

who'd never flown before.

AIR CONTROLLER #2

Bad news. The fog's getting thicker.

HINSHAW

And Liz Taylor is getting larger!

McCROSKEY

Ya know, this would be a tough landing for

anyone to make. Maybe, if we hold them off

for a bit we'll get a break in the

weather.

KRAMER

All right, but let's wait until they reach

the control area.

STRIKER

I know what you're going to say, so save

your breath.

DR. RUMACK

No. I haven't a thing to say. You've done

the best you could. You really have. The

best you could. I guess we can't expect to

win 'em all. I want to tell you something

I've kept to myself for years. I was in

the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was

on duty late one night when a badly

wounded pilot was brought in from a raid.

He could barely talk, but he looked at me

and he said, "Doc. The odds were against

us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm

glad we did. The captain made the right

decision." The pilot's name was George

Zipp.

STRIKER

George Zipp said that?

DR. RUMACK

And the last thing he said to me, "Doc,"

he said, "Sometime when the crew is up

against it and the breaks are beating the

boys, tell them to go out there with all

they've got and win just one for the

Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,

Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too

good. That's for sure."

STRIKER

(rejuvinated)

Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

KRAMER (v.o.)

All right, you'd better stay up there for

a bit. As soon as the fog lifts, we'll

bring you in.

STRIKER

I'll take it, Elaine.

STRIKER

Listen to me, Kramer. Doctor Rumack says

the sick people are in critical condition

and every minute counts. We've got to land

now!

KRAMER (v.o.)

Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what a

landing like this means. You more than

anybody. I'm ordering you to stay up

there!

STRIKER

No dice, Chicago. I'm giving the orders,

and we're coming in...I guess the foot's

on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?

McCROSKEY

He'll never bring it down in this soup.

Never! Not one chance in a million.

KRAMER

I know. I know. But it's his ship now, his

command; he's in charge, he's the boss,

the head man, the top dog, the big cheese,

the head honcho...

AIR CONTROLLER #2

Chief, look at this!

KRAMER

(reading)

'Passengers Certain to Die?!?!?!?!?!'

McCROSKEY

'Airline Negligent?!?!?!?!?!'

HINSHAW

(looking at newspaper)

There's a sale at Penny's!

KRAMER

(to men in Dispatch)

All right, I'll need three men up in the

tower.

(pointing)

You, Neubauer. You, Macias.

HINSHAW

Me John. Big tree.

HINSHAW

Wagon train comes three, maybe four day

away.

KRAMER

(into microphone)

Stand by, Striker. I'm going to the tower.

And good luck.

McCROSKEY

(into phone)

We're going to the tower.

HINSHAW

(excitedly)

The tower! Oh! Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

RANDY

In a moment we'll ask you to assume crash

positions. Your life jackets are located

under your seat.

RANDY (v.o.)

Remove the jacket and unfold it so that

the red arrow points up.

RANDY (v.o.)

Place the jacket over your head, and when

I give the word pull the cord under the

left side flap.

STRIPED CONTROLLER

We're all ready, sir.

STRIPED CONTROLLER

Captain McCroskey, this is Captain

Roberts. Captain Kramer, this is Captain

Colosimo. Captain Hinshaw, Captain Gatz.

Captain Kramer, Captain Gatz. Captain

Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

KRAMER

All right. Colosimo, you'll work the

relay. Roberts, double check all air

traffic within five miles.

KRAMER

And get that finger out of your ear. You

don't know where that finger's been!

Gunderson?

GUNDERSON

Yes, Captain?

KRAMER

Did you decide on a runway yet?

GUNDERSON

Runway niner. It's the longest, and

directly into the wind.

HINSHAW

And the foliage looks so pretty this time

of year.

KRAMER

(into mike)

Striker, you're going to have to work

fast. After this message, do not

acknowledge any transmission unless you

want to ask a question. Do you understand?

Striker, Striker, do you read me?

MRS. OVEUR

Steve!

McCROSKEY

Linda, your husband and the others are

alive but unconscious.

HINSHAW

Just like Gerald Ford!

McCROSKEY

Now there's a chance we can save them if

Striker can get this plane down on time.

MRS. OVEUR

That isn't much of a chance, is it?

HINSHAW

(appalled)

Where did you get that dress? It's an eye-

sore!

GUNDERSON

(into microphone)

Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero

eight niner.

KRAMER

(into microphone)

You are now eight miles from the airport.

Turn right to a heading of zero eight

niner, throttle back slightly and begin to

lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.

ELAINE (v.o.)

We're now at twelve hundred feet, leveling

off.

KRAMER

(to McCroskey)

Steve, I want every light you can get

poured on that field.

McCROSKEY

It's being done right now.

KRAMER

(into mike)

Tower to all emergency vehicles. Runway is

niner.

KRAMER (v.o.)

(over P.A.)

Airport vehicles take positions one and

two.

KRAMER

(into microphone)

Civilian equipment, number three.

KRAMER (v.o.)

(over P.A.)

Air Force positions number four and five.

All ambulances to position three.

HINSHAW

(into mike)

It's a twister! It's a twister! Toto!...

Auntie Em!

KRAMER (v.o.)

All right, Striker, put down twenty

degrees of flap. When your flaps are down,

retrim for level flight.

MRS. SCHIFF

Stewardess, how soon 'til we land?

RANDY

It won't be long now. Try not to worry.

GUNDERSON

He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet

up to thirteen hundred feet! What an

asshole!

KRAMER

Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too

erratic. You can't come straight in.

You've got enough fuel left for two hours

flying. You've got to stay up there 'til

we get a break in the weather.

STRIKER

I'll take it, Elaine.

(into mike)

Listen, Kramer, I'm coming in. Do you hear

me? I'm coming in right now! We have

people up here who will die in less than

an hour, never mind two. I may bend your

precious airplane, but I'll get it down!

Now get on with the landing check. I'm

putting the gear down now.

RANDY

Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

STRIKER

Thank you, Randy. You better leave

sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.

ELAINE

Ted...

STRIKER

Yes?

ELAINE

I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very

proud.

STRIKER

Tell them the gear is down and we're ready

to land.

ELAINE

(into mike)

The gear is down.

ELAINE (v.o.)

And we're ready to land.

McCROSKEY

He may not be able to fly, but he's sure

got guts.

BUSINESSMAN

Well, I'll give him another twenty

minutes, but that's it.

MILTON

I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in

case one of us...well, is there a message

you'd like me to give someone?

BERNICE

No. I'm all alone.

MILTON

Just in case I don't have a chance to say

goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't

spent so many pleasant hours for many

years.

BERNICE

That's a very nice compliment, and I'd

like to say that...you've done the same

for me.

DR. RUMACK

I just wanted to tell you both good luck.

We're all counting on you.

KRAMER

Now, Striker...hold your present heading,

put down full flap, bring your air speed

back to a hundred and thirty-five, then I

want you to take hold of the throttle...

HINSHAW

And stick it in your ear.

KRAMER

And stick it in your ear.

HINSHAW

(a la Frogsy, the Gremlin)

I'll be good, I will, I will.

GUNDERSON

Captain, he's dropping off fast. Almost

seven hundred.

KRAMER

Striker, get back to a thousand feet!

GUNDERSON

He's below seven hundred now and he's

still going down! 675! 650! 625! 600!

KRAMER

Striker, you're coming in too low! What's

your altitude?

STRIKER (v.o.)

I don't know. How high was the eighty-

ninth floor of the John Hancock Building?

GUNDERSON

He's right on the heading.

KRAMER

All right, he's on final now! Put out all

runway lights except niner.

KRAMER

Turn on your landing lights, Striker. It's

the switch above your right knee.

KRAMER (v.o.)

No. I said your right knee.

KRAMER

All right, now just listen carefully. You

should be able to see the runway at three

hundred feet.

KRAMER

Aim to touchdown a third of the way along.

There's a slight crosswind from the right,

so be ready for it.

KRAMER

If you land too fast, use your emergency

brakes. The red handle is right in front

of you.

KRAMER

If that doesn't stop you...

KRAMER

If that doesn't stop you, cut the four

ignition switches over the co-pilot's

head.

STRIKER

See them, Elaine?

ELAINE

Uh-huh.

KRAMER

Do you see us now? You should be able to

see the field now.

McCROSKEY

It sure is quiet out there.

KRAMER

Yeah -- too quiet.

McCROSKEY

Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit

sniffing glue.

KRAMER

(excited)

There he is!

(into microphone)

Striker, you're coming in too fast!

STRIKER (v.o.)

I know! I know!

ELAINE (v.o.)

(into microphone)

He knows! He knows!

McCROSKEY

Wow!

KRAMER

(into microphone)

Sound your alarm bell now.

RANDY

All right, now, everybody get in crash

positions.

ELAINE

Airspeed one twenty-five, one thirty...

HINSHAW

Just kidding!

ELAINE

...one thirty-five, one forty.

KRAMER

Striker, now listen to me. You're coming

down too fast!

KRAMER (v.o.)

Put down thirty degrees of flap!

STRIKER

It's stuck. It won't move!

KRAMER

Bring it down! Easy!

McCROSKEY

Look at all those buttons! Oh that's

beautiful! Just beautiful!

KRAMER (v.o.)

Watch your nose! It's too low!

KRAMER (v.o.)

You're coming in too hot!

KRAMER

Remember your brakes and switches! Get

ready to flare it out! You're coming in

too fast! Watch your speed!

McCROSKEY

(hysterical)

He's coming right at us!

KRAMER

You're coming in too hot! Put down full

flaps! Watch your nose!

KRAMER

Now ease her down! Down!

KRAMER

Lift the nose! Throttle back!

KRAMER

The brake! Pull the red handle!

DR. RUMACK

I just wanted to tell you both good luck.

We're all counting on you.

KRAMER

(into microphone)

Hold her steady, hold her steady!

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

You attention, please. Trans American

Flight 209 non-stop from Los Angeles is

now arriving at Gate seven...Gate eight...

KRAMER

Pull a lever!

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

...209 arriving gate thirteen...gate

fourteen....gate fifteen...

KRAMER

Push a button!

KRAMER

(into microphone)

You're too low! You're too low!

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

...gate twenty-three...twenty four...

twenty-five...

RANDY

Can we help arrange hotel accommodations

or a rent-a-car during your stay in

Chicago?

HINSHAW

(seated in wheelchair)

Wheel me to the West Wing. I wish to view

the Degas.

DR. RUMACK

I just wanted to tell you both good luck.

We're all counting on you.

KRAMER (v.o.)

Striker, Striker, are you all right?

STRIKER

(into microphone)

Yeah, we're okay.

KRAMER

Ted, that was probably the lousiest

landing in the history of this airport.

But there are some of us here...

KRAMER (v.o.)

...particularly me, who'd like to buy you

a drink and shake your hand.

KRAMER (v.o.)

...and, Ted, I just want you to know, that

when the going got tough up there, when

the chips were down...

RANDY

Hurry now. Please be careful.

KRAMER

...Lonliness, that's the bottom line. I

was never happy as a child. Christmas,

Ted, what does it mean to you? For me, it

was a living hell. Do you know what it's

like to fall in the mud and get kicked? In

the head? By an iron boot? Of course you

don't. No one does. That never happens.

Sorry, Ted. Dumb question. Strike that.

McCROSKEY (v.o.)

I didn't know that the electric eel was

approaching so rapidly nor that hidden in

the coral reef was a family of poisonous

sea urchins.

KRAMER (v.o.)

(into mike)

...and they shall be for frontlets between

thine eyes, Ted. Neither they man servant,

nor they maid servant, nor thine ox, nor

thine ass.

FADE OUT.
