BRUCE

Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.

This is a bad sign.

(calling out)

We really need to get a make-up

person?!

ALLY

Not in the budget. And not to                         *

*

worry, you're going to look great

in this.

BRUCE

A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair

net. I just did the hair.

ALLY

(matter of fact)

Health code. In the kitchen or

around the cookie, you gotta have

it.

BRUCE

(to crew: re hair net)

You guy's should tell me this

before hand, this is like a huge

waste of...moose.

BRUCE

Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *

school after this and serve lunch.

2.

ALLY

You're a thing of beauty.     In

three, two, one. . .

BRUCE

For three decades the Kowolski

Family Bakery has been a mainstay

in downtown Buffalo. Known for

their sinfully rich, cream filled,

deep fried polski pierogis. And

the occasional sugar induced coma

that follows. Today, in honor of

their 30 year anniversary, Momma

Kowolski and her sons Gustov and

Vol, decided to do something, a

little bit different. Tell me

guys, how did this idea come about?

GUSTOV

Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why

don't    we make the biggest chocolate

chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I

said,    'Yeah, sure.'

BRUCE

Wow. Fascinating.

BRUCE

The previous Buffalo cookie record

was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by

Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth

cookie clearly proving that Gustov

and Vol have much more free time.

BRUCE (CONT'D)

As we witness the ceremonial

toasting with milk it makes one

pause and think. What are we

really looking at here?

(MORE)

3.

BRUCE (CONT'D)

Is it just a big cookie or does

this cookie represent the pride of

Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard

working citizens the key

ingredient, with a few nuts thrown

in.

(motions his eyes to the

Kowolski twins)

And finally, the love of our

families which provides the warm

chewy center making our beloved

Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

BRUCE (CONT'D)

And that's the way the cookie

crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,

Eyewitness News.

BRUCE

So, what do you think?

GRACE

It's good.

BRUCE

It sucks. It's a story about a

cookie. People with eating

disorders will be riveted,

(goes into huge pathetic

fan character)

Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.

I can't wait to vomit so I can make

room for more cookies.

GRACE

I thought it was funny. I love the

hair net. How'd you get it to do

that?

4.

BRUCE

What? I'm cutting that. They made

me wear that stupid thing. I don't

even look like myself. The hair is

one of the most important parts of

an on camera persona. Right out of

the gate, I lost the hair

advantage.

GRACE

Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My

sister is so drunk.

BRUCE

Grace. Try to stay focused here.

I need your help.

GRACE

Aren't you taking this a little too

seriously?

BRUCE

It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.

There's an anchor job open. This

is important. This is our future!

GRACE

I'm sorry.

BRUCE

(sighs)

I'm never going to get anchor doing

these kind of assignments. I want

my work to matter.

GRACE

It does matter. You're funny. You

make people smile. Come on, take a

break, help me put this album

together.

BRUCE

(reluctant)

Alright.

GRACE

Oh look at this. It's the first

day we moved in together.

BRUCE

(down)

Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.

GRACE

Oh, here's me at my sister's

wedding. I caught the bouquet.

BRUCE

You look pretty intense, hun.

GRACE

Well, I was thinking about you.

BRUCE

So, you're attracted to me in some

way, is that what you're trying to

say?

GRACE

You have no idea.

BRUCE

I was saving myself for the wedding

night, but if you keep this up, I

may lose my resolve.

GRACE

Well, that's the way the cookie

crumbles.

6.

BRUCE

Hey, that's a good line, but you

need more resonance. From the

diaphragm.

(newscaster voice)

That's the way the cookie crumbles.

GRACE

Oh, say it again.

BRUCE

(bigger)

That's the way the cookie crumbles.

GRACE

(sweet, southern groupie)

Oh, I just love on-air

personalities.

BRUCE

(newscaster voice)

Well then, let me take these

clothes off and slip into my hair

net.

CUT TO:

NEWS CLIP

I'm Ed Bradley, I'm Merely Safer,

BRUCE

...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty

Minutes.

DISSOLVE TO:

7.

GRACE

Sweety, time to get up...

BRUCE

No, I'm having a great dream.

SPORTSCASTER

...and the Sabers lost another

close one last night. Four to

three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

BRUCE

Of course they lost, they're my

team.

CUT TO:

BRUCE

"And that's the way the cookie

crumbles."

(calls to Grace)

You know, I think there might be

something to that cookie line.

Everything great anchor has his own

signature sign-off.

(as Walter Cronkite)

"And that's the way the cookie

crumbles."

8.

BRUCE

Oh no!   Grace, the dog!

GRACE (O.S.)

I'm in the shower!

BRUCE

Ah!

BRUCE

Whoops, sorry.

BRUCE

Oh, you're all done, huh?

B-e-a-utiful.

GRACE

Wow, nice car, huh?

BRUCE

Yeah, if you want to rub your

success in people's faces.

BRUCE

What's with the hubbub?

GRACE

We're having a blood drive.

BRUCE

Creepy. Needles, yech...

GRACE

Oh, that's a nice response.

9.

BRUCE

I mean, it's just s o . . .

GRACE

Helpful and life saving?

BRUCE

C'mon, that's your...blood. It's

in your body and I don't think it's

supposed to come out. Besides,

they stockpile that stuff. They

have an endless supply frozen in a

warehouse somewhere then tell

everyone there's a shortage.

GRACE

They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *

giving. I have a very rare blood                     *

type, AB positive.

BRUCE

Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive

they aint touchin' me with no

needle.

GRACE

(suddenly remembers

something)

O. . .

h

BRUCE

What's that?

GRACE

Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.

Keep you safe.

BRUCE

Well, I hope they work, cause it's

going take a miracle to get me to

work on time.

10.

BRUCE

This is just my luck.

BRUCE.

The meeting's starting, perfect...

(thinks)

Screw it.

BRUCE

(laughs)

Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's

kill or be killed, only the strong

survive, no guts, no glory1

BRUCE

(looking heavenward)

Thank you.

R EWE BLIND?

BOBBY

Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.

Don't even move, I got somethin'

special today. My mom made it just

for you.

BRUCE

Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-

I'm late...

BOBBY

(bending down)

You like Quiche?

BOBBY

You know, contrary to popular

belief the quiche was actually

invented by the Mayans, then stolen

by the French. They shoulda said,

"Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's

Mayan!"

BRUCE

Bobby, I can't, I--

BOBBY

Just taste it, taste it...

BRUCE

Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.

BOBBY

That's a buck seventy-five.

BRUCE

Can you get Kelly- Ahh...

BOBBY

(excited)

Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-

five, two-ten...

12.

BOBBY

Way out of our league, huh?

BOBBY

You know, I saw them editing your

cookie piece.

BRUCE

Really?

BOBBY

They must have gotten high or

something, cause they was orderin'

everything, I had. Hey, how long

have you been interested in pastry?

'Cause I've got an aunt who makes

baklava twenty layers deep.

BRUCE

(holding money out)

Bobby.

BOBBY

(gets a brilliant idea)

Maybe you could do a story on her!

BRUCE

Keep the change.

BOBBY

(calling after)

I'll give her a call, we'll talk

about it later!

EVAN

Is something killing your kids?

Find out tonight at eleven.

13.

JACK

Okay, promos are approved, let's--

ALLY

Ah, isn't that last one a little

misleading? I mean, the story's

about flu shots. Do we have to

scare people to death?

EVAN

No, just into watching. Or I could

change it to: "Slow news day, come

yawn with us. At eleven."

FRED

Sniffles at eleven is nice.

DALLAS

Attack of the killer sniffles?

ALLY

(to Dallas)

The tanning booth is starting to

zap your brain, you know that?

DALLAS

I don't use a tanning booth.

FRED                                        *

Come on. You're turning orange.                       *

EVAN                                        *

He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *

14.

JACK

I would have swore I already said

this, but promos are approved. Now                  *

can we move on?                                     *

ALLY

Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *

focusing on Pete's retirement.

This is his last week.

EVAN

(leading)

Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open

anchor position, Jack?

JACK

Evan, you'11 know something when I

know something.

BRUCE

Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.

The traffic was -- You guys already

played the spots?

JACK

Nice story, Bruce, but we're going

with Evan's piece on the sex

scandal at the mayor's office for

sweeps.

EVAN

And that's the way the cookie

crumbles.

EVAN

I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.

See you've got to remember that the

news room is like a cookie...

BRUCE

(re: Evan's perfect

posture)

That's great Evan.

(MORE)

15.

BRUCE (cont'd)

Is you're posture naturally that

good, or do you have to shove a

stick up there?

JACK

Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're

holding your story in reserve.

Now, can we get back to the board

so we have something to air today?

BRUCE

Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you

for a second?

JACK

Sure, Bruce. What do you need?

BRUCE

Sweeps.

BOBBY

Don't worry about it.    I called my

aunt, we're on.

BRUCE

Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm

getting desperate man, I am pushing

forty and what have I got to show

for it? The point is, I've hit

some kind of a ceiling here. Some

kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And

Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.

He gets the good stories, he gets

on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more

like Evan.

JACK

You don't want to be like Evan.

Evan's an asshole.

BRUCE

I can be an asshole.

16.

JACK

No, Bruce.     You can't.

JACK

Are you going to pick that up?

BRUCE

Yeah, I'm sorry.

BRUCE

It's just- this anchor position

looming, it's gotten me nuts...

JACK                               BRUCE

SUSAN ORTEGA

Hi, Jack.

JACK

Look, Bruce. You're a good

reporter. You make people laugh.

God knows today we can use it.

JACK                                    *

(beat)

Alright, tell you what. It's the                   *

23rd anniversary of the Maid of the

Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls

in an hour.

BRUCE

Maid of the Mist. That's always

live.

JACK

Yep.

BRUCE

Evan gets the live feeds.

17.

JACK

Well now you and Evan get the live

feeds.

BRUCE

I'm going live. In sweeps.

JACK

Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.

I've seen your outtakes.

BRUCE

Yes 1 You will not regret this,

Jack.

(releases Jack)

I will not forget you when I go

national.

GRACE

Martin, are you eating the glitter

again?

GRACE

Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su

boca.

GRACE

Oh, you're not huh? Well, then

you've got a bad case of Liberace.

ZOE

Mommy1

18.

GRACE

They didn't teach you Spanish in

nursing school, did they?

DEBBIE

Well, it seemed like they were

speaking a foreign language

sometimes, but no. Problemo?

GRACE

Martin has decided to explore new

food groups.

(back to Martin)

Martin, this is for art. Like this.

DEBBIE

Is it so wrong to tie them up?

GRACE

D eb -- Ma rt i n!

GRACE

Okay, go rinse your mouth with

water. Lave su boca. Go.

(to Debbie)

I swear that kid is going to poop

an ornament.

DEBBIE

(laughs)

You're good with them, you know.

You should have some of your own.

GRACE

Don't start...

DEBBIE

Free milk cow.

GRACE

Debbie, don't call me that.

DEBBIE

If the moo fits.

GRACE

Saved by the bell.    Grab that for

me, will you?

DEBBIE

Small Wonders Day Care.

BRUCE

Grace?

DEBBIE

(cheery)

No, it's Debbie. The sister who's

life you're not wasting.

GRACE

Hey.

DEBBIE

(feigns innocent)

What?

GRACE

Sorry, honey. My sister seems to

think she's my mother. Where are

you?

BRUCE

(flying high)

Oh, A little place called the

winners circle. I'm at the Falls

doing a "live" report.

GRACE

Live? That's greatI

BRUCE

Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got

sweeps and I'm live. You know what

that means?

(MORE)

20.

BRUCE (cont'd)

They're seeing if I can think on my

feet, like you might have to do in

a live news anchor situation.

GRACE

Oh, my gosh.

BRUCE

This is happening for us, Grace.

What we've always talked about.

Jack practically came out and told

me.

GRACE

Wait, what do you mean practically?

BRUCE

Well, he didn't spell it out, but

this is exactly what happened to

Susan Ortega right before she was

bumped up to the desk.

GRACE

(being cautious)

I just want to make sure we're not

getting too ahead of ourselves.

BRUCE

I totally agree, but in the mean

time you should start thinking

about what coast you want to live

on.

BRUCE

Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go.

GRACE

Good luck, honey. I love you.                          *

BRUCE                                       *

Stop it.                                             *

ALLY

They want you close to the falls.

BRUCE

What for? I'll get soaked.

ALLY

That's the point.    They want you to

hold up this.

ALLY

Part of the condition of us getting

the exclusive.

Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes.

ALLY

Remember, this is their 23rd

anniversary. Capacity is 59. They

cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .

BRUCE

And people who are insanely                    '     *

thirsty, I get it.                                   *

ALLY

And you'll be interviewing Irene

Dansfeild...

ALLY

...She rode on the maiden voyage

with her late husband. Okay, 90                      *

seconds.

22,

BRUCE

90 seconds, going live. Think

anchor, think dignity,

(glances up toward

umbrella)

Ignore umbrella. Just have fun.

CUT TO:

PETE FINEMAN

...but because of the fast response

by our local fire fighters, the

toxic chemicals were cleaned up

without incident. Susan.

SUSAN

Bruce Nolan is standing by at

Niagara Falls with a report on the

Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,

but before we go live to Bruce, we

have an announcement to make. As

everyone knows, after 33 years, our

beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

SUSAN

Pete's shoes are virtually

impossible to fill, but the show

must go on. And we could think of

no one better than our very own

Evan Baxter.

23.

SUSAN

Congratulations, Evan. Looks like

we'll be sitting side by side from

now on.

EVAN

Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and

honored. Like you said, no one can

replace the great Pete Fineman, but

I'll do my best. I have to say I

am so proud to be a part of our

local community. Of Buffalo. I

think a great city is a lot like a

great recipe really. Put in some

hard working citizens, add some

care givers, maybe a few nuts...

EVAN (CONT'D)

All sprinkled with the strength and

love of our good families, that

ultimately creates a sweet place to

live. Thank you.

SUSAN

(touched)

Wow. That was amazing. And now

let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan

out at Niagara Falls.

GRACE

Talk honey, talk.

JACK

What's going on?

24.

DIRECTOR

We've got a Walt Disney.

CONSOLE OPERATOR

Frozen solid.

JACK

He may not have audio. Check his

feed, have Susan cover.

SUSAN

We may be having a bit of technical

difficulty...

CONSOLE OPERATOR

Feed's good, Jack.

JACK

Come on, Bruce, talk damn-it...

Okay, get ready to pull the plug.

GRACE

Please baby, say something...

BRUCE

Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here

aboard the Maid of the Mist at

Niagara falls.

GRACE

Thank you, God.

25,

JACK

(sighs relief)

Thank God.

BRUCE

First off, "I want to add another

congratulations to Evan Baxter.

It's good to see what someone with

real talent can accomplish when

great opportunities are given to

him instead of me.

(still smiling)

Anyway, I'm here, I believe with

Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me,

why did you toss the blue "heart of

the ocean" jewel over the railing

of Titanic?

BRUCE

Did you feel guilty at all letting

Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you

were safe floating on the big door?

Do you think he would have survived

if you had taken turns, or were you

too afraid to freeze your big fat

ass off?

JACK

Did I just hear..?

BRUCE

Well, I guess that's the way life

works, isn't it? Some people are

drenched, freezing to death, on a

stupid boat, with a stupid

umbrella...

(heaves the umbrella)

while others who aren't fit to kiss

my willy, are sitting in a nice,

comfy news room, sucking up all the

glory111

26.

GRACE

This isn't happening. This isn't

happening...

BRUCE

Now, lets speak to the owner. Come

on in here, Bill.

BRUCE

Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid

of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me,

why do you think I didn't get the

anchor job?

BILL

Hey, man, I don't want any--

BRUCE

Do you think it's my hair?

(Bruce messes his hair

like crazy)

Maybe my teeth aren't white enough?

Or like the great falls, is the

bedrock of my life slowly erroding

underneath me.

(moving closer to camera,

to an inch away)

Erroding. Erroooding.

Errodiiiing...

JACK

Alright, cut the feed! Cut to

black if you have to.

CONTROL BOOTH OPERATOR

I'm on it.

BRUCE

I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness

SMASH CUT TO:

BRUCE

Hey, come on guys. What are you

doin'? Just leave him alone.

BRUCE

Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.

BRUCE

B-e-a-utiful.

(MORE)

28.

BRUCE (cont'd)

Just what you get for trying to

help someone.

BRUCE

Get a clue, buddy.

GRACE

Thank God you're alright.

BRUCE

God, yeah. Let's thank God.

Thanks for everything, Lord. I am

so honored that my horrible demise

is a part of your loving and

mysterious plan.

GRACE

Bruce, don't talk like that.

BRUCE

Oh, don't worry, he's not

listening. If he is he doesn't

care. Have you seen the news

lately? We got gangs, we got

drugs, we got corruption. What

kind of God lets that happen?

Every time we cure a disease he

comes up with a new one!

(goes into God character)

Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's

God. They've just come up with a

treatment for syphilis down there.

I think it's time to release the

tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a

guy in Ohio who's praying for

strength and wisdom, blind him and

cut off his legs.

GRACE

So God is torturing us?

BRUCE

Think about it, Grace. God is all-

powerful . He could fix everything

in five minutes if he wanted to.

(MORE)

29.

BRUCE (cont'd)

But he doesn't want to. He doesn't

like me.

BRUCE

Oh, Perfect!

(to the dog)

But you're aim isn't so good, I'm

over herel

GRACE

Bruce, please. This isn't his

fault.

BRUCE

Of course not.

(hushed tone)

It's part of the mysterious plan.

GRACE

Honey, you're mad right now. It's

understandable. And what Evan did

was slimy and wrong. But your job

doesn't matter to me. You matter

to me. You could've really been

hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.

BRUCE

Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi

And I'm not okay with the fact that

you think everything is okay. I'm

not okay with a mediocre job. I'm

not okay with a mediocre apartment.

I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!

GRACE

Is that what you have, Bruce?

A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry

for being a piece in your mediocre

puzzle.

BRUCE

Terrific. I'm drowning and you

throw me a brick!

30.

BRUCE

Perfect! I'll have the worst day

of my life with a side order of

guilt, please. I-- I don't need

this.

BRUCE

Okay, God. You want me to talk to

you? Then talk back. Tell me

what's going on? What should I

do? Give me a sign...

BRUCE

I'm right here. Speak to me.

PEDESTRIAN

SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE!

BRUCE

All I need is some guidance.

Please send me a signal.

BRUCE

Oh well, I guess you don't care.

BRUCE

Okay, we'll do it your way.

(pulls the beads from the

mirror)

Lord, I need a miracle. Please

help me.

31.

BRUCE

Come on, where'd you go?

(holds them up in triumph)

Ah ha! AHHH!

BRUCE

Okay, if that's the way you want

it. The gloves are off, pal! Let

me see a little wrath! Smite me oh

mighty smiteri What, no pestilence

no boils? Come on, you got me on

the ropes, don't you want to finish

me off?! You're the one who should

be fired! The only one around here

not doing his job is YOU! What are

we, you're little pet project? A

hobby you tinker with now and

again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!

BRUCE

Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't

call you if I did.

BRUCE

Oh, no.

BRUCE

What's the point?

COMPUTERIZED VOICE

Denied that promotion at work? Is

life unfair? Everywhere you turn

is there someone less talented than

you reaping all the benefits ? Is

your name Bruce? Then do we have

COMPUTERIZED VOICE

So come on down, or we'll just keep

You're looking for room 7.

How would I get to room 7?

JANITOR

That'd be on the seventh floor.

Stairs are right over there.

BRUCE

What about the elevator?

JANITOR

Out of order.

JANITOR

You mind giving me a hand with this

BRUCE

What? Yeah, I mind.

BRUCE

Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,

MAN (O.S.)

Be right with y.a, just fixin' a

BRUCE

Yep, seems to be.

Kinda bright, though.

Yeah, it is for most people. They

spend their lives in the dark...

JANITOR (CONT'D)

. . . thinkin' they can hide from me.

BRUCE

Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?

JANITOR

Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

BRUCE

You installed a clapper?

JANITOR

Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.

(sings)

CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP

OFF. THE CLAPPER.

(claps twice)

You can't get it out of your head.

BRUCE

I gotta go.

JANITOR

Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.

JANITOR

You must be Bruce. I've been

expecting you.

BRUCE

Oh, this is hilarious. So you're

the boss and the electrician and

the janitor.

36.

JANITOR

Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your

sleeves, son. People underestimate

the benefits of good 'ol manual

labor. There's freedom in it.

Happiest people in the world stink

like hell at the end of the day.

JANITOR

Your father knew that. He was a

damn good welder.

BRUCE

How do you know my father? And how

did you get my pager number?

JANITOR

Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.

Pretty much everything there is to

know. Everything you've ever said,

done or thought about doin', is

right there in that file cabinet.

BRUCE

(sarcastic)

Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?

Mind if I take a look?

JANITOR

It's your life.

JANITOR

Now this last entry was a little

disturbing.

JANITOR

(reads, scanning)

Thanks for everything, Lord.

(MORE)

37.

JANITOR (cont'd)

I am so honored that my horrible

demise is a part of your loving and

mysterious plan.. The gloves are

off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty

smiter.

(aside)

I'm not much for blaspheming but

that one made me laugh. Oh, and

let's not forget "What kind of a

God would let this happen? I mean,

have you seen then news lately?"

BRUCE

Who are you?

JANITOR

I'm the creator of the heavens and

the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.

The first and the last.

BRUCE

Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.

JANITOR/GOD

I'm God, Bruce.

BRUCE

Oh, you're God. Well that explains

everything1 That's how you know

everything about me. That's how

you got up to the seventh floor so

quickly.

(placating)

Well, it's really nice to meet you.

Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,

ah, good luck with the apocalypse.

BRUCE

Okay, I don't know how you're doing

that, but I really gotta go. This

place is obviously rigged in some

way. We're on some freaky hidden

camera show.

(playing to the "cameras")

...for which I will not sign a

release, by the way! But you know

what, I'd be a little more

impressed if you didn't use the

cheesy file cabinet illusion.

(MORE)

38.

BRUCE      (cont'd)

Everyone with a      brain in their head

would know that      the drawer is being

fed through the       wall from behind--

Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a

normal back.

BRUCE

Okay.     That's good.   That's a good

one.

Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.

BRUCE

Okay, God. How many fingers am I

holding out?

Bruce extends three fingers.

GOD

Three.

He quickly pulls one finger in.

GOD

Two.

Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a

beat.

GOD

Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...

One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.

BRUCE

Okay, how about now.

He quickly pulls in two fingers.

GOD

Seven.

.BRUCE

AH HAl

Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended

fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS

ON HIS ONE HAND.

BRUCE

AAAHHHl

39,

GOD

You've been doing a lot of

complaining about me, Bruce. And

quite frankly, I'm tired of it...

BRUCE

You stay away from me! I don't

know what your doing. But whatever

you're doing is probably

actionable!

GOD

Well, that's not very neighborly.

I brought you here to offer you a

job.

BRUCE

Job? Wh at job?

GOD

My job. You think you can do it

better, so here's your chance.

When you leave this building you

will be endowed with all my powers.

BRUCE

Sure, whatever you say, Pal.

GOD

All the power of God.

BRUCE

Okay, that did not happen.

40.

BRUCE

No.

BRUCE

I'm having a breakdown. That's

what it is. Just a normal,

everyday psychotic episode, brought

on by tumor or brain lesion...

BRUCE

(to the car)

Come on, startI

BRUCE

(denial)

Well, that was lucky.

BRUCE

Okay, just relax here. I did not

meet God and I do not have his

powers.

If that was God, then I'm Mario

Andretti.

BRUCE

WAITRESS

(becoming emotional)

And I'm sleeping with my best

friend's husband. I know he's just

using me but.. I'm just so tired of

being alone. I don't know why I'm

telling you all this. Just seems

like you'd understand.

BRUCE

Okay.

Take care of that whenever you're

GOD

(re: the cockroach)

Most people want to kill these

guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very

streamlined design. Like little

armored tanks. Y'know, they can

hold their breath for forty minutes

and their cells divide only once

per molting cycle creating a

cytoskeleton with cell adhesion

that...

(catching himself)

Oh, this is a bit over your head,

isn't it?

44.

GOD

Okay, let me explain the rules.

BRUCE

Rules ?

GOD

Yeah, you left in such a rush I

didn't get a chance to explain.

BRUCE

Well the two extra fingers freaked

me out a little bit.

GOD

(laughs)

I figured that would get your

attention.. I did the same thing to

Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three

weeks. Now, here's the deal. You

have all my power. Use it any way

you choose. There are only two

rules. You can't tell anyone

you're God. Believe me you don't

want that kind of attention. And

you can't mess with free will.

BRUCE

Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?

GOD

(excited)

Yes you can. That's the beauty it.

BRUCE

This is amazing.

GOD

Oh, speaking of amazing...

45.

GOD

Since you're finished with these, I

think I'll hang to 'em. Might come

in handy someday.

GOD

I'll be seein' ya.

BRUCE

Where are you going?

GOD

I'm taking a vacation.

BRUCE

God can't take a vacation. Can he?

Can you?

GOD

Ever hear of the Dark Ages?

Besides, I'm covered. You can fix

everything in five minutes if you

want to, right?

BRUCE

...Right.

DAN RATHER

The body of Jimmy Hoffa was

uncovered in a field today outside

of a canine training center in

Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo

freelance field reporter Bruce

Nolan was the first on the scene...

59.

BRUCE

Since the disapearence of Teamster

president Jimmy Hoffa in the

nineteen sixties, his whereabouts

have remained one of this country's

great unsolved mysteries. That is

until just moments ago, when during

a routine training session, a

police dog named Hank sniffed his

way right into the history books.

As you can see behind us, the body

is being carefully exhumed and will

be transported to a hospital

facility where DNA testing will

confirm the identity. That, of

course, only a formality as in a

bizarre twist, the body was found

buried with a birth certificate and

complete set of dental records.

(rubs Hank's neck)

Sort of a two-in-one for Hank

today, as moments later, he busted

a local news camera crew with four

kilo's of marijuana.

DEBBIE

So this is what success buys you.

GRACE

I guess.

(wiggling around)

I feel like a human taquito.

DEBBIE

Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.

He's on a quite a roll. What'd he

do make a deal with the devil?

GRACE

And he's taking me out tonight to

dinner at Chez L'Amour.

DEBBIE

Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a

romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.

DEBBIE

(to Margarita)

What does this do again?

MARGARITA

EstS para su grasa.

DEBBIE

Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?

71.

GRACE

Afraid so.

GRACE

(gushing)

So, Bruce said and I quote:

"Prepare yourself for an amazing

evening that will change our lives

forever."

DEBBIE

Good - you wouldn't want to leave

any spare oxygen in there.

(back to Grace)

Wait a second, you don't think he's

going to propose, do you?

GRACE

I don't think anything.

DEBBIE

You do. You think he's going to

propose.

GRACE

Well, he's always said when he gets

his career together, you know...

And his career is more than

together. I mean, come on, Chez

L'Amour. Change our lives...

DEBBIE

I don't know, hun. I mean, I like

Bruce but that man's priority list

is him, him, him, then him some

more and then you.

GRACE

Well, he just might surprise you.

DEBBIE

That's what I'm worried about.

(re: Margarita)

Careful, you missed a spot of free

flowing circulation.

72.

DEBBIE

That'd do it.

DEBBIE

Let's see, how do I--

MARGARITA

Lesbianas1

DEBBIE

Hey, I'll take that over fat...

MARGARITA

No sexo, no sexol

BRUCE

Very good. If you run out just

bring me some water, I'll take it

from there.

GRACE

Should we ask for a more private

table?

73,

BRUCE

Huh? Oh, no this is fine right

here.

BRUCE

I was going to wait until after the

meal, but I think it's going to

just bust out of me if I don't do

it now.

BRUCE

You ready?

GRACE

(nervous)

I think so.

BRUCE

I got anchor.

BRUCE

Evidently, they're having problems

with Evan. He's finishing up the

week and I go live Monday.

GRACE

That's great, honey.

Congratulations. Wow. So that's

what's tonight is about?

BRUCE

Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.

We got anchor!

BRUCE

(noticing her flat

reaction)

What's the matter?

GRACE

Well, to be honest, I thought that

maybe tonight, you--

74.

CUTE GIRL #1

I'm sorry, but we had to come over.

We just think you're amazing and...

CUTE GIRL #2

Well, we can't believe it's you!

They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.

BRUCE

(laughing along)

Yep, it's me.

CUTE GIRL #1

Can we get a picture with you?

BRUCE

Well, sure.

(glances to Grace)

Just one second, hun.

(leans to Grace)

Fans. We better get used to this,

huh?

Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on

Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the

attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they

leave. Grace is clearly upset.

GRACE

You have lipstick on your face.

BRUCE

Oh, thanks...

GRACE

Bruce, we need to talk. I thought

we had an understanding--

Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,

figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.

BRUCE

Wow. It's kind of loud in here.

Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.

GRACE

What are you talking about? It's

not loud.

The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.

75.

BRUCE

Geez...

(shouts to the restaurant)

GRACE

Bruce, this isn't funny.

BRUCE

(talking loud .over the

"racket")

WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A

SECOND?

GOD (O.S.)

Really something isn't it?

BRUCE

Is this heaven?

GOD

It's Everest. You should try

flipping on the Discovery Channel

every now and then. Well, I guess

you can't now, being dead and all.

BRUCE

I'm dead?I

76.

GOD

No, I'm just messing with you.

BRUCE

Those voices...

GOD

They're prayers, Bruce. You keep

ignoring them and they're going to

build up on. you like that. You

didn't think being God was going to

be all fun and games did you?

BRUCE

Prayers? Those are prayers? Why

can't I understand them?

GOD

You aren't listening, son. Let's

see, you've had my powers for over

a week now and how many people have

you helped?

BRUCE

Okay, so maybe I've righted a

couple of the wrongs in my own

life. I was going to get around to

others. I can do both. I can help

the world.

GOD

The world? That wasn't the world,

Bruce. That was just Buffalo,

between Commonwealth and 57th.

Didn't want to start you out with

more than you can handle. Now how

you doing otherwise? Personal life

in good shape?

BRUCE

Yeah. Everything is great.

GRACE

Bruce? What are you doing out

here?

77,

BRUCE

Oh, ah,

(to God)

She can't...

(God shakes his head, back

to Grace)

I just, ah, needed a little fresh

air.

GRACE

Bruce, what is going on? The

second I want to talk about us you

run out on me.

GOD

(to Bruce)

Everything's great, huh?

BRUCE

I wasn't running out on you...

GRACE

You know, I actually had the crazy

idea that you were going to ask me

to marry you tonight.

GOD

Now it's heating up.

BRUCE

(to God)

You are not helping.

(back to Grace)

...me at all here, Grace.

GOD

(sarcastic)

Nice recovery.

GRACE

Not helping you what?

BRUCE

(to Grace)

Look hun, I want to talk about

this. This just isn't a good time.

Okay?

78.

GRACE

When is it a good time? It's never

a good time.

GOD

She's got a point.

BRUCE

(to God)

Stay out of this.

*

GRACE

Who are you talking to?!

BRUCE

Oh, not now.

GOD

You're going to have to answer

those things, y'know.

GRACE

Fin e. Yo u kn ow wh at? I 'm go in g t o

go home and if by some miracle it                          *

suddenly becomes a 'good time', you                        *

know where to find me.                                     *

(starts out, then)                                    *

And speaking of time, you're                               *

running out of it.                                         *

BRUCE

(to God)

Thank you.

GOD

You want some friendly advice?

BRUCE

No.

79.

GOD

You wanted the job, Bruce.     I                        *

suggest you get to it.                                  *

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY                            *

Grace is asleep in the bedroom while Bruce paces in the           *

living room.                                                      *

BRUCE                                         *

Okay...Prayers.                                         *

He concentrates for a second and in an instant, the WHISPERS      *

start in.

BRUCE

Okay, first off, this creepy

whisper thing has got to go.

(paces)

Organization and management. I

need a system. Something

concrete...

(an idea)                                          *

Prayer files 1                                          *

(commands)                                         *

Let all prayers be organized into                       *

Bruce WAVES HIS HAND---                                           *

Instantly, the room is JAMMED FULL OF FILE. CABINETS.             *

BRUCE                                       *

Too b ulky. Ah! Praye r po st-it s!                  *

Instantly, the files are gone and millions of POST-IT'S, EACH *

WITH A PERSON'S PRAYER REQUEST begin slapping down attaching *

themselves to everything in the room.                           *

Bruce himself becomes a big post-it mummy. He pulls the one *

covering his mouth.                                               *

BRUCE                                       *

Sloppy.                                                 *

(an idea)                                         *

Ah!                                                     *

CUT TO:              *

Bruce sits before a High Tech computer sitting on a    desktop.   *

We HEAR the famous "You've Got Mail" sound bite.                  *

GRACE                                      *

Is this why you didn't come to bed?                   *

BRUCE                                      *

like.

BOBBY

(deep demonic voice)

Thanks. I've grown kind of

attached to it.

L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was

the wildest thing, I was worried,

so I said a prayer and the next

thing I know, I was completely

healed. It was like a miracle.

BRUCE

(fakes happy)

That's great.

GRACE

So, you're taking me to lunch?

Th is i s ra re --

Really?

paid out 17 dollars. Can you

believe the odds of that?

BRUCE

Keep 'em closed...

What is this?

BRUCE

Okay...open your eyes.

GRACE

What?

BRUCE

(beaming)

This is our new home.    Come on...

GRACE

This had to cost-- I can't even

imagine how much this had to cost.

BRUCE

7 million. That was the asking,

but I got a deal.

GRACE

Wh-What am I missing here? You

can't afford this. You're a

reporter. Buying cars is one

t hing, but this--

BRUCE

We'll have the money. Listen to me

closely. I'm getting anchor.

Then, I'm going to get spotted,

offers will come flooding in to go

national, and then you and I are

moving to New York City to a place

that will put this to shame. This

has been my exact dream my whole

life and it's finally going to

happen. Every step just how I

pictured it.

GRACE

There's only one problem.

I hate it.

There was a man who had two sons.

The younger son took his

inheritance and squandered his

money on a life of lust and

debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Hey there.

SUSAN

Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out

here all alone?

BRUCE

Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.

SUSAN

Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I

love the new place, by the way. So

how are you and Grace doing?

BRUCE

I don't know, we had a fight

earlier. Ever since I . . Well,

things are different now and...

94.

SUSAN

You're on fire Bruce. Some women

can't handle fire. Some can.

SUSAN

You know, I always had an instinct

about you. I knew you were going

to make something of yourself.

BRUCE

Really?

SUSAN

There's something special about you

Bruce. I like special...

BRUCE

Look Susan, I don't know, I--

DEBBIE

So this is your new place, huh?

GRACE

Cozy, don't you think? Come on

help me find him.

DEBBIE

You sure you want to do this?

GRACE

I don't know. It's his big night.                      *

I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *

Oh, boy.

BRUCE

Grace, I...

GRACE

. (fighting back tears)

Get the car, Deb.

DEBBIE

Right.

BRUCE

Grace, wait.

BRUCE

Grace, come on.

GRACE

Here. I do n't w ant your car. I

don't want your things. . . I don't

want you.

BRUCE

Come on, don't say that. I was

just calling y ou--

GRACE

And you thought Susan's mouth was

the phone?

BRUCE

I didn't think you were coming-- I

mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.

Let me make it up to you.

GRACE

How about a boat, Bruce?

BRUCE

If that's what you want.

96.

GRACE

Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two

bags of cash, you know, the ones

with the big cartoon dollar signs

on the front. Then I'll be happy.

Because I'm just hollow inside.

Debbie's been right. All this

there was good in you. Another

side to you. Well, I just saw that

other side and I don't want

anything to do with it.

BRUCE

Grace, come on, don't do this.

GRACE

Go back to your little co-anchor.

Or is that ho-anchor?

(tearing)

I came back here to apologize. How

stupid am I?

BRUCE

You're the one that didn't like the

new place!

BRUCE

You can't walk out on me! I'm the

alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!

BRUCE

(desperate last attempt)

I could make you stay!

BRUCE

Fine! I don't need you! I have

everything I need. Did you hear

that?!

(yelling)

I have EVERYTHING!

She'll take me back.

(uncertain)

Will she take me back?

GOD

Would you take you back?

How do you make someone love you

Welcome to my world, son. You come

Hi.

Hi..

I, ah, have my first anchor

GRACE

That's great. I hope it goes well

for you.

BRUCE

I miss you.

(off her silence)

I just took the first step, shot

myself out on the ledge, awaiting

vulnerably your response.

GRACE

. . . I don't know what to say.

BRUCE

How about you love me and you'll

take me back.

GRACE

No, Bruce.

BRUCE

Come on, what about all the signs?

GRACE

What? How do you know about that?

Did you talk to Debbie?

BRUCE

Would it help if I told you I acted

like an ass?

Hey, you said ass.

"Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find

meaning."

"Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to

find his way..."

don't want to do this anymore. I

don't want to be God.

Please, help me.

I work in mysterious ways, son.

You knew it all along. You knew if

I got everything I wanted, I would

ruin my life.

BRUCE

So I'm dead... Okay. If this is

what you want. Okay, okay...

Go ahead, use 'em.

BRUCE

Alright... I've learned that I

don't know as much I thought I

did...

GOD

Boy, you can say that again.

BRUCE

Hey, I'm praying here.

Sorry, go.

BRUCE

If I could have just one thing in

the world. It would be for Grace

to live a happy, joyful life. And

that she finds someone...

(getting emotional as he

realizes what he's

saying)

...that she finds someone that will

treat her with the love and respect

that she so deserves.
