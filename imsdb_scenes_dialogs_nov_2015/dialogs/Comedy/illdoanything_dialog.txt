"I'LL DO ANYTHING"

Screenplay by

James L. Brooks

1994

SHOOTING DRAFT

FRANTIC ACTRESS

I can't hear over this shhing.

TV CRITIC

...a play about guess what? That's

right, young people.

HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY

I can't look.

MATT

Good idea, let's not.

HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY

How can we not listen to this?

MATT

We'll know all we need to from the

reaction.

TORTURED MALE DANCER

He should be shot, he should be dead,

he should rot in hell, then come

back as the soap cake in a urinal.

HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY

(to dancer)

He didn't like it?

DIRECTOR

Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll

just wait for the papers.

MATT

Hey, no matter what this review says,

the play was a great experience for

me.

MATT

(again)

I mean, it is about process, right?

HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY

Matt's right. Good Lord, it is what

we're alive for.

MATT

You've just got to be tougher than

this.

BETH

(incredulous)

Tougher than this?!?

DIRECTOR

I took it all down over the phone.

It's quite bad. And, unfortunately,

it's very, very long. I've got a

broken heart and writers' cramp.

He...

MATT

He's nuts.

DIRECTOR

He savages everyone.

MATT

I don't want to hear anymore. Let's

dance.

DIRECTOR

Except you, Matt.

HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY

(fiercely to Matt)

You filthy bastard.

BETH

(drawing closer to

Matt)

What did he say?

MATT

Don't read it.

OTHER ACTOR

Oh, please. You can't wait to run

out of here, buy a flashlight, and

then go into some dark alley and

drool over every word.

MATT

(truthfully)

You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and

curious. That's it.

BETH

(wildly exasperated)

What did they say about him?

DIRECTOR

(reading)

...'in the midst of this delirium of

pretension...'

MATT

Don't. This divisive crap won't...

DIRECTOR

(again)

'...one actor, rather miraculously,

manages to provide passion and, yes,

truth. Matt Hobbs, in the supporting

role of Jesus, manages to touch the

heart long after you thought it numbed

by boredom.'

MATT

(to his colleagues

with sincerity)

Sorry.

MORPH TO:

'EMMY NIGHT - 1980'

BETH

Will you get in here--for God's sake?

MATT

(into phone)

Come on, Ma, how could I show up

tonight when my union is boycotting

the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up.

BETH (O. S.)

(screaming voice)

It's on right now... right now...

right this second! You will miss

it!!

MATT

(into phone)

I gotta go. Watch!

TV VOICE

(on TV)

...and Matt Hobbs for 'Caine Mutiny

Court Martial'... And the winner is

Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story

of a Massacre.'

BETH

Shit! Fuck! Shit!

MATT

He was good.

BETH

(again)

Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Look,

he even showed up.

MATT

That took courage. I wonder if they

send you something for just being

nominated?

BETH

Of all the pathetic questions.

MATT

(sharply)

Why are you being so damn foul?

BETH

We've been going back and forth on

our status for so long. I was hoping

that if you won, it might mean

something for us.

MATT

Look, Beth... the only...

BETH

Please go fast. I can't take you

dragging it out.

MATT

(a bit faster)

The only reason I haven't...

BETH

I promised myself I wouldn't be so

bossy. Take your time!! Was that

bossy too?

MATT

(persisting)

The only thing I have against getting

married is that it might not be fair

because I'm going to stay with acting

forever and you know how erratic the

money's been and there's no resolve...

BETH

Do I get to vote? I'm going to tell

you something I never told you before.

Your feeling towards your work is

one of the things I love most about

you.

MATT

Really?

BETH

Maybe the most.

MATT

Hey, then we have no problem here.

Marry me.

BETH

Stinker, I almost gave up on you.

MATT

I was just worried whether I could

make you happy.

MORPH TO:

'1986'

MATT

(extremely hyper)

Everything's okay... Great... She's

six or eight pounds even. Oh, God...

Nothing like it. I'll tell you

something amazing. They really reach

right into her stomach and pull out

this baby. It's not just a rumor.

God. I understand the expression

'mind blowing' for the first time.

It means something so wonderful

happens that the top of your head

comes off and your brain pops out.

Part of it was terrifying, the baby

was turned and they couldn't budge

her. I kept looking at this one woman

doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie

finally came out, this doctor and I

each wiped away a tear at the exact

same time, caught ourselves doing

it, and then laughed together at the

same time. Nothing can prepare you

for it. You know why you're alive.

MATT

How you doing? What's wrong?

BETH

My mother said you were flirting

with the doctor during the delivery.

MORPH TO:

MATT

Could you get her, honey? I have

that big reading tomorrow.

BETH

No, I have a lot to do tomorrow,

too. I have to borrow on our Christmas

Club, I have to...

MATT

Don't worry about money anymore.

(on her look)

I didn't want to tell you, because

it may sound a little strange when I

say it out loud. You know me, I'm

never that cocky. But I'm going to

get 'Spider Woman'. It's me or Raul

and I've never been so sure. It's

weird, but I just know it. I do.

BETH

(broadly)

Boy, am I reassured. What good news.

Isn't that a load off?

MATT

I am gonna get this part, Beth.

BETH

I can't stand this anymore.

MATT

(into phone)

Hello... Hi, Beth. I'm glad you

finally returned my call. What are

you so mad about?

(again, into phone)

YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

WHO CAN SCREAM, I CAN SCREAM, TOO.

MATT

(again, into phone)

You know what? I'm being a sort of

gutless wonder here. I'm yelling

back at you because I'm embarrassed.

I won't be able to take the kid when

I said... Why don't you listen for a

second?

BETH (V. O.)

(from phone)

...You're taking her... You're taking

her... You're taking her...

MATT

Beth, I know exactly how long it's

been and I feel strange as hell not

seeing her but this isn't a choice.

I'm broke. It's the driest spell of

my life. I'm not saying it's your

problem, but it's no place for a six-

year-old. What can I do? The only

full-time job I seem to have is not

showing how scared I am. What? No,

that's not something I said before.

(accepting compliment)

Well, thanks.

MATT

(again, into phone)

Beth, Hey... hey. Never mind, I'll

do it.

MATT

(again, to himself)

I must get work. I will take anything.

I must get work. I must not be

embarrassed by these pep talks to

myself...

MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR

...feathers I'm blowing. What am I,

a duck?

VARIOUS YOUNG ACTORS

1) I'm not thinking about whether

I'm going to shoot you. I'm...

2)...trying to decide where.

3)...the little spot behind the ear

where you die before you hear the

shot...

4)...on the left side of the belly

which is a very mean place.

MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR

What am I, a duck?

OLDER ACTRESS

Sure I'll tell you... Favor first...

Do a nice middle-aged lady a favor...

A fair trade... tell you what you

want to know in return for a...

(grimaces over dialogue

she must say)

...a pity fu...

VARIOUS YOUNG HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES

...the height of ego. You think your

he-manness can make me get on that

elevator even though I'm phobic?...

I CAN'T GET ON THAT ELEVATOR. I don't

care if... they catch us. DO YOU

GET... IT. DO YOU GET IT! I CAN'T! I

CAN'T... three, please.

SINGING ACTRESSES

...can't get on the elevator... can't

get on the elevator... even if you

make me... even if you make me. Do

you get it?... do you get it?...

MATT

Hi... See, I did recognize you. You

didn't have to wait for me.

CATHY

Well, I wanted to introduce you. As

if knowing me would help.

CATHY

It's a ridiculously awful movie.

MATT

Well, challenge. I wasn't sure you'd

remember me... let alone help...

CATHY

Stop. You're good. I'm doing them a

favor by getting you in.

MATT

Well, that's a fresh slant.

CATHY

Claire, this is Matt Hobbs.

CLAIRE

Hi. Sorry. We're running behind...

Please forgive us.

LONG DISSOLVE TO:

CLAIRE

(fiercely)

Matt Hobbs? Matt Hobbs!

MARTIN

This is Matt Hobbs... This is John

Earl McAlpine, the director.

MCALPINE

Good to see you.

MARTIN

...and Burke Adler, the producer.

BURKE

So, what have you been doing with

yourself...

(checking resume)

...the last few years?

MATT

(to Burke)

I'm real bad at interviews, so, if

you don't mind, I'd really prefer to

just read first.

BURKE

That's the way you want to do it?

MATT

Yes.

BURKE

Maybe we shouldn't even read. I'll

just take your word that you're good.

BURKE

No. I'm serious. There's all different

ways. Did you know Woody Allen never

reads actors? He just looks at them,

feels around a little and then decides

who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't

hear them do a line. I also have a

way. What I do is interview first--

then read--maybe do it all over again

the next day. I call up people the

actor has worked with--check him

out. If he's famous, I do an opinion

survey to test how much people like

him. If he's not famous, I put him

on tape and show it to everyone I

can grab. I believe in screen tests;

I believe in replacing if the dailies

are bad, in cutting people out if

the previews aren't there. Because

I'm not doing movies for theaters

where they serve cappucino in the

lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You

want to know what I like? Come to my

house, look at my lamps... you won't

find it in my movies. In my movies,

you'll find out what I know. I know

how to do detail. What I don't know,

I discover. Yesterday we finished

mixing a movie--the last scene is in

a field of windmills which blows up

and all the blades of these windmills

slice through the air, one of which

hits a four-story tank of propane

gas. A humongous explosion scene. I

kept on saying 'louder', and they

finally said to me they couldn't go

louder without distortion. We went

louder. We had to discover a thing,

a filter, but we went louder. I don't

question doing these things. I do

them. So if you want to know if it's

okay to do it differently--not to

talk--to just read first... I say...

(pointing to John

Earl)

Ask him--he's the director.

JOHN EARL

Whatever.

BURKE

Okay, let's do it. Do you have any

questions?

MATT

They only gave me these two pages.

I'd like to give this my best shot.

So if I could read the script and

come back...

BURKE

This part works tomorrow.

MATT

Oh. Who will I be reading with?

MATT

(from his chair)

Can I read from here?

BURKE

I want you to do it wherever you're

comfortable, but I'd prefer it if

you were comfortable standing up.

JOHN EARL

Time for my buns to have visitors.

BURKE

(to Matt)

Go ahead.

MATT

Go ahead? The director left.

BURKE

That's okay, he trusts me, uh... And

we're just doing the first page.

MARTIN

(cueing him badly)

'Okay, darling Harry, here it is...

If someone were breaking up with me,

I'd like it short and sweet. What

about you?'

MATT

(reading--showing

pain)

'Incredibly drawn out...'

MARTIN

'I can't take care of you right now.

What am I, your mother?'

MATT

(intense)

'Well, what am I? Your duck?'

MATT

(again)

'We've been together two years and

you act like all you're doing is

blowing away some feathers. So what

I'm asking...'

BURKE

You didn't do the quack.

MATT

Huh?

BURKE

The stage direction says for him to

quack.

MATT

I know, but why would he quack when

someone's breaking up with him?

BURKE

Hopefully because it's funny.

MATT

This isn't a comedy.

BURKE

Then we're in trouble, because they're

already fall down laughing at the

teaser-trailer in fifty-two hundred

and thirty theaters.

MATT

A comedy?

(rubbing his face)

I think I have to make an adjustment

here.

FEMALE D PERSON (O.S.)

I'm not supposed to read TV pilots.

Don't call us D-Girls. We're

Development Persons!

CATHY

(into phone)

Hi. I just finished. I'll have my

coverage right over. It's past

derivative... it's photocopying.

What a hoot! You're kidding, right?

There is truly active bidding for

this book? Really? 2.3 million? Okay,

see you.

MALE D PERSON

Even the title "Little Dick"--it

means so many things.

FEMALE D PERSON

Story, story, story, story, story.

(seeing Cathy)

You loved it, right?

CATHY

I had some problems.

FEMALE D PERSON

Like what?

CATHY

Well, you know, it's a little

garbagey.

FEMALE D PERSON

So it has to be cast right.

MALE D PERSON

If Cathy doesn't like it, we know

it's a smash.

CATHY

(stung)

Hey. It's not like I didn't recommend

it.

CATHY

How'd it go?

MATT

I didn't get it. He did say something

about wanting me back.

CATHY

Good. His saver is he means what he

says.

MATT

Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks.

MATT

...and I wanted to ask you out.

CATHY

(turns)

For when?

MATT

Any time.

CATHY

I never know when I'm free.

(Matt nods)

It sounds like I'm just... but it's

true.

MATT

Okay. Thanks again. I felt funny

asking.

CATHY

Well, don't please.

MATT

I meant asking you to get me the

audition.

CATHY

Oh... well, don't please.

CATHY

Don't be sad.

MALE D PERSON

Who is he?

CATHY

Oh, I was auditing this acting course

and he filled in teaching one night.

He did a scene himself and he was

awesome. For some reason, he can't

get arrested.

MALE D PERSON

Yeah. He does seem to have a layer

of loser dust on him.

BURKE

Oh, God... why? Why?...

(louder)

What am I going to do?

MATT

Hey. Hey! HEY!!

BURKE

Look at me. You'd think I was a

writer.

(his story of travail

pours from him)

I hired this kid as a production

assistant. His father's a business

manager... a few good clients.

MATT

What happened?

BURKE

He's been driving for me two weeks...

all he has to do is pick me up on

time... he's twenty minutes late and

I have a test screening in the valley.

Everybody's gone from the office.

MATT

Is that it? You need a lift?

BURKE

Yeah.

MATT

I'm right over here.

BURKE (O.S.)

...Not just today... believe me,

there's no way you'll ever make it...

You are going to fail. Listen, listen--

I know about this; you are going to

be a failure.

BURKE

(to Matt)

Let's get moving; you said you'd

give me a lift.

MATT

What the hell are you talking about?

Not in your car... I've got my own.

BURKE

I'll give you a hundred and twenty

dollars to take me... and it will

still be a favor.

(to Young Man)

Get out. Come on.

(to Matt)

Please. This is very important.

YOUNG MAN

(final plea)

A guy got shot on the freeway...

Traffic's tied up.

BURKE

You should leave time for that kind

of thing.

CUT TO:

MATT

What do you need me for? Don't you

drive?

BURKE

(a mumble)

Yeah, I drive. I don't like to look

for parking.

BURKE

(explaining)

Yoga shit. I feel like barbed wire.

I don't know if you keep track, but

I'm the sixth independent producer

ever to have two big pictures

scheduled for Christmas, and tonight

we're testing the first one for the

first time... You get it?

MATT

Yeah. It's important to you.

BURKE

(laughing at the

understatement)

Yes. I don't think I would have put

it that way... but, yes...

BURKE

Keep driving. She runs the test

screenings. Very smart. Very. She

has a real case on me, but so far

I've been keeping it in the bank.

BURKE

Go very slow.

NAN

We're 34 minutes late. The studio is

appropriately wild... people are

beginning to leave... but I knew how

upset you'd be if we started without

you.

BURKE

(distantly)

Yeah. Thanks.

NAN

How is he tonight?

MATT

I don't know him, so I have nothing

to compare it to.

NAN

Well, how would you say he is, anyway?

MATT

Not quite himself.

BURKE

Let them in.

NAN

The name of the picture you'll be

seeing is 'Ground Zero'... There may

be some scratches... some of the

colors may be off, there are no final

titles, and it has not been finally

mixed for sound, and the music is

temp, that means temporary...

BURKE

I'm glad you came yourself instead

of sending your staff.

BURKE

I wouldn't be surprised if tonight's

screening is a monster.

(emphatically)

Could happen, right?

STUDIO HEAD

Sure.

BURKE

Okay.

BURKE

(to Matt)

Eisner just said he thinks the

screening will be a monster.

NAN

Please, God, let tonight give him

peace.

NAN

We're short two card-counters, can

you two help out?

NAN

Males, fifteen and under.

HERO

Sorry to bust your chops.

NAN

If you'll just stay in your seats a

few moments and fill out these cards

for us...

GROUP CAPTAIN

Who has young males? Young women?

Older males?... Older males?...

GROUP CAPTAIN

Older males... older males?

GROUP CAPTAIN

(again)

Older males... over 25?

NAN

How long since you've seen your

daughter?

MATT

A little over two years.

(on her look)

My wife insisted on moving back to

the Midwest--then I was in the

Philippines on the mini-series and...

NAN

(suddenly and loudly)

Oh, please. It's one thing being a

son-of-a-bitch, but you don't have

to be a stupid son-of-a-bitch. People

move heaven and earth to see their

kids. I don't care if she moved to

Pluto, it's abandonment.

MATT

(a pause, then)

Hey, we just met.

NAN

(realizing)

Oh. Sorry.

BURKE

Make a guess how we did.

NAN

It wouldn't mean anything.

BURKE

Nothing good that happens can make

it worth feeling the way I do now.

Nothing.

OLDER WOMAN

Excuse me.

BURKE

Who the hell are you? This is private.

OLD LADY

I'm Mr. Eisner's mother.

BURKE

Oh. Can I get you some water?

OLD LADY

No, thank you.

STUDIO HEAD

I don't need the numbers. I loved

it.

NAN

Burke, ninety in the top two boxes.

BURKE

Now can I get you some water?

CATHY

I never thought it would do this

well. There were so many holes; I

told everybody it wasn't going to do

business. Why am I so public with my

opinions?

MATT

You might be right.

CATHY

Not with that score. You know, maybe

tonight's the night I'm losing my

entire mind, but weren't you in

'Platoon?'

MATT

Incredible. I was only there for a

minute in the rape scene, moving

past Charlie Sheen when I left the

hut... I had a great scene cut out...

I was...

CATHY

But there was that one long close up--

where you seemed ashamed of yourself

but still arrogant.

MATT

That's exactly what I was going for.

CATHY

It reminded me of my last boyfriend.

(indicating book bag)

Got to go.

MATT

You have to read all that?

CATHY

Beast of burden.

MATT

(sincerely)

So what are you, totally wonderful

or what?

BURKE

How come you haven't said anything?

This is great, right?

NAN

No.

BURKE

What no?

NAN

The definite recommends are way off

for a score this high and, even for

action-adventure, it's just too low

for women.

(Burke looks anguished)

I'm sorry.

BURKE

It was such a good score.

NAN

(extraordinarily

sympathetic)

I know... And, unfortunately,

yesterday's tracking wasn't...

(he reacts)

I'm sorry... They just don't seem in

the mood for action-adventure right...

(he reacts)

Sorry... May I tell you one more

thing?

(he looks up in

anticipatory fear)

I think it's so wonderful that you

don't worry about even trying to act

strong.

BURKE

Thanks. You want to eat something

sometime?

NAN

I'm, uh... I'm blushing from head to

foot.

BURKE

Good. I'll call you.

GROUP CAPTAIN

Thirty-two, thirty-three.

BURKE

You want to do this regularly for

me? I was gonna offer, but I thought

it would humiliate you.

MATT

(straight at him)

I don't mind an occasional odd job.

But I can't work tomorrow. I have to

get my kid.

BURKE

Okay, I got the cards to look at--I

think I'll ride back here.

(to Nan)

Maybe I'll drop by your place

tomorrow.

NAN

So, thanks for lunch. I hope this

leads to an evening date. Though I

have to stay home with my daughter,

Leslie, on Saturdays.

BURKE

(sincerely)

Yeah, okay. You were very interesting

to talk to. I swear to God. Honest.

No kidding. You really were.

NAN

I believe you.

(sincerely)

And I was very surprised what you

were like when you weren't working.

There was absolutely no difference.

You want to see where we do the

tracking?

BURKE

(excited)

Is it okay?

NAN

Nobody ever wants to see how we do

the polling, but they're like little

starved puppies when the data comes

in--running at you, scrambling to...

VARIOUS WORKERS

1) How often do you go to the movies?

2) I'm going to describe a movie in

one sentence and then ask you to

rate it on a scale of...

BURKE

(as the workers

continue)

I love this. This is what counts and

this is where you count it.

NAN

(soft and true)

That's the same way I feel.

BURKE

You phone all over--you know what

movies they're waiting to see, whether

your TV spots are working. You know

what the country thinks.

WORKER

...what feelings do you have about

Cher as a singer, an actress, or

potential date...

BURKE

(again)

...and it's accurate.

NAN

Within six-point-eight percent.

BURKE

And you can't fix it... right?

NAN

No... no... Sometimes just for myself,

I can't resist asking America a

personal question.

BURKE

Like?

NAN

(simply)

When do you feel more worthless--

mornings or afternoons?

BURKE

I gotta get back.

WORKER

Assume Michelle Pfeiffer is the woman--

which of these 67 actors would you

most like to see her with... Patrick

Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Dustin Hoffman,

Johnny Dep, the guy from 'Major

Dad'...

NAN

There's something I meant to tell

you. You may have noticed something

unusual about me.

BURKE

I gotta get back.

NAN

I could never find the right time

to...

BURKE

Is this urgent?

NAN

Well, maybe not urgent, but

immediately significant and necessary

to tell.

(a deep breath)

You see, there's these pills...

BURKE

'Cause I gotta go. I'm listening

with an eighth of an ear now.

NAN

So long.

MAN

Are you Matt?

MATT

Uh-huh.

MAN

I didn't know if we could wait much

longer. Come on in.

MAN

(again)

She's a real nut on smoking anywhere

near the kid.

BETH

Hello--did you two meet?

MATT

Not really. Is she ready? I have the

taxi waiting.

BETH

I just have to say goodbye. You have

no idea how difficult that is.

MATT

It's three weeks.

BETH

It's not three weeks.

MATT

Yes, it is.

BETH

No, it's not.

MATT

It is.

MAN

He doesn't know?

BETH

You are not taking her for a visit.

You are taking her for a while.

MATT

Just because you want to go off with

him doesn't mean I...

MAN

You're getting the wrong idea.

MATT

I don't think so. No matter how you

put this...

MAN

Hey, look, I'm a United States

Marshal. I'm here because she didn't

show up yesterday to start serving

her time.

BETH

I don't have a choice. You don't

have a choice.

MATT

What did she do?

BETH

(turning)

I loved, helped and supported in

every possible way a business man

who committed the terrible crime of

being financially imaginative with a

pension fund.

BETH'S VOICE

Okay, listen carefully, Jeannie. Be

still. Now, what's the most important

thing in life to know?

JEANNIE

No one will ever love me as much as

you do.

BETH

Good. Now, concentrate with all your

muscles and remember everything I'm

about to say to you...

BETH

Don't talk to strangers. They may be

killers. Take your vitamins so the

poison in the food can't hurt you.

What else now?

JEANNIE'S VOICE

Teeth.

BETH'S VOICE

Right. Thank you. Brush right after

you eat or your gums will start to

bleed in your sleep and choke you.

BETH

What? I'm giving Jeannie her

reminders.

MATT

Reminders?!? You can't say things

like that to a little...

BETH

No. Don't. No. Don't dare. Don't

criticize the way I mother or I think

I'll start to scream and never st...

MARSHAL

Mrs. Hobbs.

BETH

(suddenly cheery)

Yes.

MARSHAL

You know, I've been involved with

this sort of thing for a long time.

BETH

You're not going to criticize me,

are you? Not in front of him--because

all he's done is send Jeannie these

long, stupid letters. He doesn't

even realize she can't read. He sends

letters to someone who can't read.

(laughs)

It's almost funny.

MATT

I thought you'd read them to her.

BETH

(realizing)

Oh.

MARSHAL

I'm not faulting you. You love your

daughter and this is a very tough

thing to go through. You feel guilty

and caring and it all gets mixed up

so that there's so much important

stuff going down that there's no

sure way of dealing with it, but the

best thing you can do is just make

sure you love her.

BETH

Typical cop talk.

(on his look)

But I understand what you're trying

to say. Thank you. Can I have another

minute with her?

MATT

Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

JEANNIE

(laughing mirthlessly)

Hello, monster-poop.

MATT

(to U.S. Marshal)

She has her mother's sense of humor.

BETH

Okay, love, Mommy's going to help

others who need her for a few years,

and you're going with Daddy as I

explained.

(to Marshal and Matt)

We'll all have to help with the

luggage.

BETH

(turning to Matt)

Beginning now, you must give less

value to your own happiness and well-

being, then hopefully, you will reach

the point where you give that no

value whatsoever. Give her everything.

There's no such thing as spoiling a

child.

MAN

Even if you have to steal to do it?

BETH

You don't really want to mess with

me, do you?

MAN

(simple honesty)

No.

MATT

(to Jeannie)

Okay, sweetie. We have to go.

JEANNIE

(to Beth)

I want to go with you.

BETH

Can't, pretty-heart. I'm sorry.

JEANNIE

Not even a compromise?

BETH

(thinking)

The compromise will be that you don't

have to ride in back; you can ride

up front with the driver... okay?

MATT

What?

JEANNIE

Okay.

MATT

(to driver)

Can we please go?

MATT

It's going to be okay. I'm you're

dad, you know? So it will be okay.

You and I will make it okay. You

ever ridden in a plane before?

JEANNIE

(a sudden gust of

anger)

Yesssss!

JEANNIE

Don't stare at me.

MATT

Sorry.

JEANNIE

I want to put on my yellow dress

now.

MATT

It's underneath the plane. We can't

get it.

JEANNIE

I want to put on my dress. I want to

put on my dress.

MATT

There's no way we can get the dress--

it's impossible.

MATT

Don't kick the seat!

JEANNIE

I want the yellow dress.

(a shriek)

Give me a compromise.

MATT

As soon as we land. That's the

compromise.

WOMEN IN ROW

Don't hit her.

MATT

God, I didn't hit her--she hit her.

JEANNIE

Noooooo. Let go of me. Noooo. The

yellow dress... let go... let go.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

You'll have to sit down.

MATT

(yelling)

Jeannie, we have to sit down. Please.

CAPTAIN'S VOICE

We'll be having some turbulence for

the next twenty minutes or so. Will

the cabin attendants please take

their seats?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Sir.

MATT

(simply and utterly)

I have no idea what to do.

MATT

Jeannie, you okay?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Go back to your seat. I'll get her.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

She wants to be alone. So we're

upgrading her.

JEANNIE

These are the wrong jammies.

MATT

Okay... so what do we do?

JEANNIE

Where do I sleep?

MATT

I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which

one do you want?

JEANNIE

That.

JEANNIE

Hug.

JEANNIE

(sharply)

Let go.

NAN

Monica--is Leslie up yet? Good. I

didn't want you to get worried when

you realized I wasn't there. I'm

still with that man. I'll tell you

about it later. But it's sure nice

to have wobbly legs again. Look,

today's recycling day for Leslie at

school, so give her some empty cans...

well, then dump some out for her!

Tell her I had to leave real early

for work and I'll pick her up at

school myself to make up for it and

we'll rent any cassette she wants

for tonight. Thank you... Take good

care.

BURKE

Oh, I thought you took off in the

middle of the night.

NAN

No. I just had to call home. Is that

why you're sad?

BURKE

No. It's Everett. This kid who used

to work for me. He was always crazy

to do his own movie.

NAN

(fearing worst)

What happened?

BURKE

(very down)

His movie not only opened to a three

million dollar Friday--it's gotten

great reviews.

BURKE

(again)

Listen. I'm tremendously worried

about 'Ground Zero' because of the

bad 'want to sees' you sent over.

But that's just me being nervous

over nothing, isn't it?

NAN

No. That's just you correctly

assessing the situation. So stop

being so hard on yourself.

MATT

How're you doing? I'm from next door.

I see you with your kids in the

laundry room...

LUCY

Hello.

(seeing Jeannie, turns

warmer)

...Who are you?

MATT

Say, 'Hello, I'm your new neighbor

now too.'

LUCY

I'm Lucy Crisala... What's your name?

MATT

Say, 'Jeannie.'

LUCY

I have a little girl too.

MATT

Say, 'Isn't that nice... How old is

she?'

LUCY

She's four and a half and I have a

little boy who is not yet one year.

MATT

Say, 'That's nice... I'd like to

play with them... My Daddy didn't

know your phone number, so we just

decided to...'

LUCY

(interrupting)

What can I do for you?

MATT

Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight

and...'

(catching himself and

looks directly at

Lucy)

I need someone to help me and her on

short notice. I've seen your around

with your kids and hoped you knew

someone in the building or close by.

I've got this new job that starts

now. Do you know anyone?

LUCY

Well, I'm always here. I could maybe

do it myself.

MATT

(there is a God and a

good one at that)

Oh, this is so great. Let's work out

a full-time schedule and...

LUCY

Wait. Jeannie, why don't you come in

for a minute and meet Ricky and Essa.

Come on, we're making fruit bars.

LUCY

(again, to Matt)

Why don't you leave her for a while

and then we talk.

MATT

Sort of a test?

LUCY

We'll just see how it works.

MATT

Please behave, understand? I don't

know what we'll do if this doesn't

work, so behave, sweetheart. Behave,

behave.

DISSOLVE TO:

MATT

I'm sorry I bothered you.

(calling inside)

Jeannie...

LUCY

Could I have her a little bit longer?

My little boy just fell and Jeannie

is the only one he let hold him.

MATT

Your little boy fell, so he's

screaming. And you want her to stay.

LUCY

Okay. Seven dollars an hour?

MATT

Great. Thank you. See you later,

Jeannie.

MATT

No, that's okay. I'm fine with it. I

feel fine.

BURKE

Nothing good that happens tonight

can make it worth feeling the way I

do right now. Nothing.

(turning to Cathy)

What do you think?

CATHY

(nervously taking the

plunge)

To be honest, I had problems with

'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get

Hurt' one, while it might not be my

exact, exact thing, I think will

really work for an audience. It's so

over the top, you have a great time.

BURKE

So you think it'll score big?

CATHY

Yes.

NAN

Don't worry. My daughter used to

throw fits in supermarkets when we

first moved here. It's all so

perfectly normal. Plus I know a great

psychiatric children's group.

MATT

That's what breaks your heart.

Jeannie's problem is that she's so

down on herself.

NAN

Well, she's lucky to have a daddy

who cares, believe me.

MATT

I don't know if lucky's the word.

I'm hoping she's asleep when I get

home so I won't have to deal with

her... I'm actually afraid of my own

kid.

NAN

Oh, my. I've had exactly that feeling

and never said it out loud. See,

there are men who talk my language

and I'm just cursed that I'm not

attracted to them because they are

so nice they remind me of myself.

GROUP CAPTAIN

Excellents?

GIRL COUNTER

Seven.

GROUP CAPTAIN

Very goods?

BOY COUNTER

14.

GROUP CAPTAIN

Fairs?

SECOND BOY CARD COUNTER

30.

GROUP CAPTAIN

Poors?

SECOND GIRL CARD COUNTER

Just a second...

(finishes counting)

666.

NAN

I felt terrible about the way I blew

up at you when I first met you.

(before he can object)

Please.

BURKE

What are they doing?

NAN

I began taking anti-depressants when

we moved here from Washington. I had

some small reactions--sleeping 14

hours, no libido, I gained 17 pounds

in nine days--that sort of thing. So

they gave me pills to deal with the

side effects. And then pills to deal

with the side effects I was getting

from those pills. All this besides

the stuff the nutritionist was giving

me. The combination formed some sort

of potion so that I keep telling the

truth. I don't have a choice. That's

why I was so rude to you.

MATT

Your doctor says this?

NAN

Oh, yes. He's excited, but only

because he sees glory for himself in

it... See, ordinarily I wouldn't say

that about my doctor, but I can't

help it, it's the truth. He's

monitoring me for a while longer

before writing it up for this medical

journal...

CATHY

Burke's going crazy waiting for the

score.

NAN

Coming.

CATHY

(to Matt)

How are you, anyway?

CATHY

(a small laugh)

It's a tough one, huh? Me too.

NAN

Oh, my. Matt, I'd better drive him

myself.

BURKE

I can fix this... Get some narration

written. . .

(turning to Director)

You'll cut 30 minutes. It will come

out like butter.

DIRECTOR

We're only 77 minutes now...

BURKE

(mumbling to himself)

...a 47-minute movie... no, that

won't work...

FEMALE STUDIO EXEC

I have to go. I have a nanny problem.

Priorities, right?

BURKE

Thanks for the support.

BURKE

(again)

Can you help?

NAN

Yes, I can.

BURKE

(hopeful)

Go ahead.

NAN

It's only a movie.

BLACK OUT:

JEANNIE

Let go. Please, Lucy, don't make me

go.

MATT

Everyone's tired. You can come back

tomorr...

LUCY

Listen to me, Jeannie...

JEANNIE

I want to live here with these people.

God, let me live here.

MATT

Maybe if she stayed tonight she...

JEANNIE

I love it here so much that...

JEANNIE

Daddy says I can stay.

LUCY

I no think you can give her what

pleases when she act like this...

Because then she think...

MATT

I know... I know...

MATT

You'll see Lucy in the morning. We're

going home.

JEANNIE

No. I'm not! STOP!

DISSOLVE TO:

MILLIE

Will somebody take a minute to look

over my casting list before Burke

gets here?

MALE D PERSON

(scanning list)

This isn't so great, Millie.

MILLIE

Well, I wanted to put in people we

had a shot at getting.

MALE D PERSON

(reading from list)

F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed

Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem

Dafoe, John Malkovich... For an action

lead?

MILLIE

Could you at least take it one person

at a time instead of...

MALE D PERSON

Okay. Let's play 'State the

Obvious'... F. Murray Abraham has a

nose as long as an Aspen ski line,

Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe

Mantegna has never played the lead

in a big movie... Willem Dafoe's

teeth... Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing

when he takes off his shirt...

Malkovich...

MATT

I can't stand it anymore. I can't.

CATHY

What's wrong? What happened?

MATT

What, in God's name, are you doing

in this job you have?

MATT

I mean him. What, in God's name, do

you know about casting?

MALE D PERSON

Me?

MATT

Yes. What do you know? About anything?

You don't even know you have a habit

of touching your tongue with a finger

like you want to lick yourself.

(note: this is his

little habit)

Yet, you talk like you actually know

something... So I want you to tell

me...

(louder)

...what you know.

MALE D PERSON

I'm not going to be drawn into this.

MATT

I've been an actor most of my life

and this is the first time I've ever

heard what the people calling the

shots sound like when they're casting.

So I really want to find out what,

if anything, you know because what

if nothing you know.

FEMALE D PERSON

I don't think the yelling is

necessary.

MATT

Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And

I'm not talking to you. And I don't

like you.

MALE D PERSON

How about you just mind your own

business?

MATT

You're minding my business. That's

the problem... so, just tell me,

what do you know?

MATT

Just tell me and I'll shut up.

MALE D PERSON

(taking the bait)

First of all, I've been going to

movies since I was six, for God's

sake...

MATT

What you know is the size of a

schnozz. What you don't know is that

these guys...

(indicates list)

...are for real...

MATT

(again)

...that they can make something

happen, and even they don't know

what that is till they get in there

and play a little... they can make

something happen that you can't even

imagine... and it's not your fault,

this stupidity... 'cause you're just

this scared little prick who gets to

say he's making movies, and the only

thing they ever taught you is that

what you like doesn't matter.

MALE D PERSON

(frightened)

Thanks for understanding.

MATT

But isn't it almost good manners for

you to feel a little shame?

MATT

(again)

I didn't mean you.

CATHY

If you didn't, you sure should have.

MALE D PERSON

You talk about manners--are you

actually so bitter you don't realize

how you acted just now? You're gone,

pal. But at least know that we can't

help that we're making it.

MATT

Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky

with 'bitter.' That word just scares

me to death.

BURKE

You look down.

CATHY

I am.

BURKE

Thank you. I appreciate the support.

CATHY

I'm not down for you. I'm down about

myself.

BURKE

(not hearing)

Oh. What if 'Ground Zero' doesn't do

well this weekend?

CATHY

Please listen to me.

BURKE

What?

CATHY

I just got this feeling of seeing

myself talking to you and how this

is the most important moment of...

ever.

BURKE

(brusquely)

Okay. Good. What is it?

CATHY

I've been watching this company make

movies that cost tens of millions of

dollars and all the while I've known

about this wonderful script which we

can somehow own and we could make

for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000

if you can live without stars or a

name director.

BURKE

Is that it? Okay, send me...

CATHY

I've sent you coverage on it nine

times. I swear to you, Burke, it

will work. You've never heard me say

that.

BURKE

How about last night?

CATHY

(an unexpectedly fierce

outburst)

I don't know anything about action-

adventure!!

(on his look, she

gains control)

I have no idea where that came from.

Hey, I know everyone thinks I don't

have any commercial sense because of

what I said at the 'Gremlins' preview

and all... And you think I can't put

myself on the line. Well, if this

picture doesn't work, fire me. Have

me killed if it doesn't get good

reviews. If this doesn't get a 70

percent definite recommend from women

49 and under, I promise to be your

sex slave until they drop ticket

prices back to five bucks and start

enforcing the R rating.

BURKE

You're selling very excellent. Very

excellent presentation.

CATHY

You've got to do this. I think this

movie can save me.

BURKE

(disgusted)

Oh, please... What's the script?

CATHY

'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.'

JEANNIE

Why couldn't you even look at the

way I dressed Ricky?

MATT

Look, I don't want to talk about it.

I just had a real rough day... so

just let it sit there, okay?

JEANNIE

But what was it? Tellll me...

Compromise... You sad?

MATT

Yes.

(through gritted neck

cords)

Now, I really need to be quiet.

JEANNIE

(eyes him, then)

You!! I know what will cheer you up.

JEANNIE

I can't even remember the words... I

am stupid.

MATT

No, you're not. You're not stupid

and I'm not bitter... and you know

why? Because there's no cure for

either one and we've got to believe

in some cure for each of us.

JEANNIE

I am stupid. I can't even remember

the words to some baby song.

MATT

Oh, Jeannie... I just can't do this

now.

MATT

(into phone)

Hello? Yes. Cathy... Hey. Just a

second.

MATT

Jeannie, please... be quiet for one

second... this is very important for

me.

MATT

(into phone)

So? Wow. Good for you.

Congratulations.

MATT

Me? This is great. I'll come right

over and pick up the script. Okay.

If you want to. Bring it over.

Goodbye.

(to Jeannie)

We might make it yet, kid.

MATT'S VOICE

Cathy?

CATHY

Yes.

MATT'S VOICE

I'll buzz you in. You've got to be

quick and push hard.

JEANNIE'S VOICE

But why can't I stay just a little

while?

MATT'S VOICE

Because this is a very special friend

of Daddy's and I need privacy... Be

fair... I let you wear that dress.

MATT

Hi.

MATT

This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth.

Jeannie, this is Cathy.

CATHY

Hi... What a pretty dress.

JEANNIE

Thank you. That's nice.

CATHY

Are you going to a party?

JEANNIE

(wildly hopeful)

Am I going to a party, Dad?

MATT

(quickly)

No. You're going next door.

MATT

Remember our compromise? You're going

next door to Lucy's to play and you'll

show the kids your dress and I'll

come get you later and we'll go out

someplace and I'll buy you anything

you want for under seventeen dollars?

JEANNIE

I remember.

JEANNIE

(again to Cathy)

Goodbye. I love you...

CATHY

(totally thrown)

Well,... thank you.

MATT

(sotto)

Thanks.

CATHY

What a little winner, huh?

MATT

(modestly)

Oh...?

CATHY

(waving script)

This is my favorite project. And it

looks like we're going ahead with

it.

MATT

(overlap)

'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?' Oh, it's a

remake...

CATHY

Well, come on, what's original? And

this is a wonderful rewrite. It's

funnier.

MATT

And there's a part in it for...

CATHY

Yes... Burke says I can test whoever

I want. He wasn't even surprised

when I mentioned you. So, if you

could read this rewrite now and if

you like it, we can make a test

deal...

(catching herself)

they can make a test deal... we can

tell them that they can make a test

deal.

(in explanation)

I think it's important for me to

steer clear of the business end.

MATT

Okay... which part?

CATHY

Longfellow Deeds.

MATT

Mr. Deeds?

CATHY

Who goes to town, yes.

MATT

Who are we kidding? I'm even having

trouble getting short parts--I'm

going to say I love it no matter

what you've done to it.

CATHY

Stop being so creepy honest. I really

have an instinct about you for this.

I'm going home--call me when you

finish reading it.

(how quickly status

changes things)

Or... come on over.

BURKE

Why not? If you can test movies and

premises and want-to-sees, why can't

you test screen tests?

NAN

I can't deal with your self-centered

dribble right now. I have just had

the biggest orgasm of my life and

I'm trying to figure out if I'm in

love with you.

BURKE

What?

NAN

Whoops. Tell me what made you rush

over and pick me up and bring me

here at six o'clock. I mean we seem

to have...

NAN

(again)

...this unspoken agreement not to

talk about why we're together when

we're together and I don't think

it's good to let that become a pattern

for us.

BURKE

Why did I rush to you? Because I

felt like I had to... be with someone

and you were closest.

(on Nan's reaction)

What's wrong?

NAN

You're not at all aware that you've

just said something...

(her eyes close)

...unattractive?

BURKE

Look, I'm sorry if that came out...

NAN

I'm not looking for an apology.

BURKE

I'm just trying to say that one of

the things I'm not great at is...

NAN

Let's not make this about your

shortcomings. I'm sure you've had

enough of those conversations to

last you a lifetime. What I'm...

BURKE

No, I haven't.

NAN

No, you haven't what?

BURKE

Had a conversation about

shortcomings...

NAN

(aghast)

No woman has ever told you that you

have an almost barbaric insensitivity?

That you seem to have lapsed into

some final cynicism, where you

actually believe that, not only does

everyone think the way you do, but

only you have the courage to express

it? That you seem horribly certain

everyone else is sort of pretending

when they talk about love or seem to

care for anything outside their own

anus? No one's ever said that sort

of thing to you?

BURKE

Oh, yeah... But I didn't get what

you meant by 'shortcomings.' Hey, if

you think things like that, what are

you doing here?

NAN

(indignantly)

I'm here for the same reason 86

percent of older women loved 'Beauty

and the Beast.' I would like to

believe that underneath the creature,

there is a sweet, caring guy.

BURKE

I sure hope you're wrong.

NAN

I have to pick up Leslie.

CATHY

(calling)

I mistimed it.

(sticking her head

out the door)

I wanted you to catch me fully

frontal.

CATHY

So you loved it. A lot? A little?

MATT

Give me a second--all of a sudden,

there's a lot to deal with.

MATT

(again)

It's terrific.

CATHY

(pointedly)

Do you see why I think you're right?

MATT

Because you're nice and you know I

need work.

CATHY

(lower)

You know this is really happening,

so I wish you wouldn't kid around

about it.

MATT

Sorry, but I think the audition rule

is that I have to be serious unless

the person in charge is wearing a

bathrobe and her nipples are sticking

out...

(holds fingers apart)

...this much.

CATHY

There are some mixed signals coming

out of here, aren't there?

(phone rings; she

answers)

Hi. Working... I can't write down a

number now. Call me back.

(to Matt)

The script?

MATT

It's really good. I get a little

nervous thinking about the

opportunity.

CATHY

I want to hear everything. You want

to go page by page?

MATT

If it's okay. I kind of work on these

things in a private... it's just...

it's a little better for me if I

don't...

CATHY

(hurt)

Okay.

MATT

Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me.

CATHY

Please. I understand.

MATT

I swear to God, I don't know which

thing I want more, the sex or the

conversation afterwards.

CATHY

(a smile)

What do you mean?

MATT

I mean I haven't been to bed with

anyone since Jeannie got here... I

haven't talked to anyone the way I

need to.

(cradling her breast)

I haven't seen anything this

beautiful. I haven't felt this good

about life. I mean, I've been lonely,

Cathy.

CATHY

(as he enters her)

I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've

never felt more like turning my phone

off.

MATT

You can't shut the phone off. I left

this number with Jeannie's sitter.

CATHY

I don't understand what you're worried

about.

MATT

I'm not worried. But if the phone

was off, I would worry.

CATHY

But I get a lot of calls.

MATT

Oh.

CATHY

I could put the machine on 'monitor,'

but it's going to be... I don't know.

MATT

It will be okay. I think the most

important thing is to stop talking

about the phone. Turn it off, monitor,

whatever.

CATHY

Okay.

CATHY

You look so serious.

MATT

I am so serious.

YOUNGER MALE VOICE

(broadly)

Hi, Cathy... All my magazines came

today... Read the new Vanity Fair,

they take apart three people we

hate... Spy is bad this month...

Scorsese didn't get the Time cover,

the plane crash did... ha, ha, ha...

Why aren't you at the office? You

know, I'm getting to the point where

I prefer to reach people's machines...

Bye.

MALE D PERSON VOICE

Cathy? Are you there? Hello... Are

you there?? I'm going to count to

ten. One, two, three...

(then to someone

passing his office)

Did you go to the screening last

night? What did you think? That makes

two bombs in a row for her.

(into phone)

...four, five, six... Pick up if

you're there. I've got major gossip...

major screwup. It could be good for

us.

MATT

Is this the kind of crap you listen

to all day?

CATHY

Please, we're making love here.

BURKE'S VOICE

(incredibly depressed)

If the TV show bombs, there's going

to be a dance party on my grave. I

don't give a crap. Nothing seems to

have a point anymore. I'm really

questioning everything... including

action-adventure... Don't tell anyone

I'm down. Even destroy the message

tape. Don't tell anyone I said to

destroy the message tape. Don't even

give hints that there's something

you can't tell them, but you wish

you could... I'm losing it. I'm losing

it. I'm losing it. Don't tell nobody.

Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody.

JEANNIE'S VOICE

(sobbing)

Daddy...

(berating someone who

is with her)

You dialed bad... Where is he?

LUCY'S VOICE

(with Jeannie coaching

b.g.)

Matt, Jeannie is very upset because

you are not here when you said. And

now the big hand is on the eight...

MATT

I'm sorry...

CATHY

It's all right.

MATT

(as he leaves)

Is there a name for what we just

had?

MATT

This is awkward, my driving you around

and testing for you tomorrow.

BURKE

Not really.

MATT

Well, I hope you understand I can't

drive you to work tomorrow and then

go in and test. It's just...

BURKE

Okay. I was going to come in late

anyway. I'll get one of the kids to

drive me.

MATT

Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead

in this movie, you'll have to go

back to sitting up front with me.

MATT

(into phone)

No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving

now.

CATHY

Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch

of kids in the building. She's

fascinated. And they're all ready

for you.

MATT

How many men are they testing today?

CATHY

You're the only one.

MATT

Then tell them I need a little more

time.

MAKE-UP PERSON

No, it's okay, we're done.

MATT

I mean for me. I want to focus a

little.

CATHY

Sure.

(she hugs Matt)

Good luck, Matt.

(whispered advice)

The thing they're looking for most

is sexy.

HAIR PERSON

You know who she was involved with

for a minute or so?

MAKE-UP PERSON

Who?

MATT

(quickly)

Hey!

MATT

(again)

You guys have to leave. This is

important and I need to be alone

right now...

JEANNIE

Get out of my way!

CATHY

Don't say it like that!!!

JEANNIE

Which way should I?

(polite little girl)

Get out of my way.

(almost weeping)

Get out of my way.

(furious)

Get out of my way.

CASTING PERSON

Wow.

MATT

It felt great... Everybody...

JEANNIE

Let me tell him, let me tell him,

let me tell him...

CATHY

(highly annoyed)

Let him finish! God!

JEANNIE

I want to tell him.

CATHY

If you wait one minute, I'll let

you.

MATT

Anyway, the girl I did it with, by

the way, she's really good; the

director, the crew... they all thought

we nailed it.

CATHY

(loving, sexy)

Hey.

JEANNIE

(to Cathy)

Now?

CATHY

Wait till you hear this one.

JEANNIE

Some lady asked me to go in a room

and, you know, make believe and say

stuff like we were playing a game...

JEANNIE

(again)

And everybody went 'yea' and they

said they wanted me to be on

television.

JEANNIE

And give me money and have a teacher

there and a person to braid my hair

and color my face and give me

clothes...

MATT

You wait here, Jeannie.

MATT

(furious)

I have to talk to you.

CATHY

Don't!

MATT

What in hell is wrong with you? You

actually think...

CATHY

I'm trying to hang in here but

everything in me cuts off when

somebody acts this way.

MATT

(continuing right

along)

...that you can have my kid audition

for a show without asking me.

CATHY

I didn't... She went for water and

by the time she got back, they had

offered her the part. Blame Burke,

he was there...

MATT

What's the part, anyway?

CATHY

The white kid in a multi-racial foster

home with all these kids of varying

ages. It's not a bad show. I sure

can't wait to see the test.

MATT

How were they able to test her so

fast?

CATHY

No. They offered it to her off the

reading. I meant your test.

MATT

Oh... A child actor. Just what any

kid with problems needs to straighten

out--a series of her own...

MATT

You'll let me know as soon as they

see my test?

CATHY

Right away... You've got my vote.

JEANNIE

I'm doing it.

MATT

Not if I don't let you. That's the

law, the police law.

JEANNIE

Do I have to learn to read to be on

television?

MATT

(with a real edge)

You're going to have to learn to

look at me and listen to me and the

longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER

I'M GOING TO BE.

JEANNIE

(looks up suddenly)

I'm so mad.

MATT

Me too. Just listen.

JEANNIE

I don't... why?!?

MATT

Because I know about this. I have

worked with kid actors... They don't

have that much fun. They're inside

all day... they don't get to go to

regular schools or play with their

regular friends like Ricky and Essa.

(progressively losing

it)

And their parents? You think I'm

going to be one of those parents,

sitting in one of those rooms, where

we all go crazy trying to jump start

our egos with our kids' sweat, all

the time smiling at each other like

our lives are working while we root

against everyone else's little girl?

(Jeannie is totally

confused, until)

No!! No way! I can't!

JEANNIE

Okay. So, no, you're cuckoo anyway.

I won't do it. And I don't care

because I'm be stupid at it anyway.

MATT

Pick it up, Jeannie.

MATT

Let's work on it.

BURKE

So how do you think 'Ground Zero'

will do tonight?

BURKE

How do you think my movie will do

tonight?

NAN

(testy)

I'm not going to talk to you during

Matt's screentest.

BURKE

(to himself)

How bad can it be? We've got to have

at least a two million dollar Friday.

There's nothing else out there.

CATHY

(turning to him)

Please.

BURKE

I'm watching...

BURKE'S VOICE

Stop playing with that thing.

ACTRESS

(crying)

C'mon, Deeds, tell me about the

meeting.

MATT

What's wrong?

ACTRESS

Don't worry about my crying. As a

matter of fact, crying turns me on.

MATT

Well, in that case, your dog died.

ACTRESS

What happened at the meeting?

MATT

I can't remember. You're too pretty.

(on her look)

Oh, I told them I'd keep on being

Chairman.

(then explaining)

I'm Chairman, you know.

ACTRESS

(smiling)

I know.

MATT

Told them I'd keep on being Chairman

if they hired everybody back.

ACTRESS

What did they say?

MATT

Oh, that I was crazy. You always

wear your hair back like that?

BURKE

Okay, come on... let's have our

creative meeting right here.

MALE D PERSON

Well, I'd sure go to bed with her.

BURKE

(professionally

concurring)

Very fuckable.

MALE CASTING PERSON

I'd sure fuck her.

BURKE

Okay... that's her... What about

him?

FEMALE D PERSON

I think he's a very good to excellent

actor--I do...

(puzzled)

But there's something...

BURKE

You wouldn't want to fuck him?

FEMALE D PERSON

Well, six years ago, maybe.

CLAIRE

I think he's talented and attractive.

BURKE

So you'd want to fuck him?

CLAIRE

He might be light in that area.

CATHY

The man is talented. If you get one

of those directors who like actors,

I think...

BURKE

A director can't make you hot if

you're not hot. You'll end up with

warm which is death.

CATHY

(defending Matt

slightly)

We laughed.

BURKE

Let me ask you something... Would

you fuck him?

CATHY

(wearily)

Everything doesn't boil down to...

BURKE

Let me stop you before you embarrass

yourself.

BURKE

(again)

We all can do our little lectures on

what things boil down to. Everybody

else here was professional enough to

come out and say... I'd fuck her...

I wouldn't fuck him... and you're

ducking it... I want you to forget

the acting stuff and totally focus

on the issue.

BURKE

(again)

We do have some kind of responsibility

to the audience... You just saw his

screentest... so, if this is the

first time you saw the guy, do you

come out thinking to yourself and

your girl friends, 'I'd sure go to

bed with him; oh God, would he be

something.' Would you, Cathy?... I'm

being real here.

CATHY

No...

BURKE

Okay, so let's keep looking.

CATHY

(into phone)

Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure...

CATHY

(again)

Matt...

(louder)

Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be

easier if I just said 'hi' to her...

Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting...

No, no. He's right, honey, they get

somebody to read it to you. Now, put

your dad on--it's important. No,

first put your dad on... DAMN IT!

(she waits a beat)

...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago...

They all... everyone liked your work,

but I think they'll go for a name or

something.

CATHY

(again)

It's not a matter of doing it

differently... they liked what you

did, a lot... they laughed and...

it's not you... it's them.

(suddenly her breath

comes weird)

No, please. Don't thank me. If you

feel like getting together later or

anytime, call me, okay? You sound

like you have your hands full right

now... Goodbye.

JEANNIE

I wanted to talk to her again...

I...

JEANNIE

Dad? Daddy?

MATT

Everything's okay... I'm sorry I

forgot to put you back on with Cathy.

JEANNIE

You didn't cried because of that...

I don't even want to talk to her.

JEANNIE

(a whisper)

Dad. Can I say just one thing?

JEANNIE

You've got to make me supper.

VOICE

You have reached the Warner's Hotline.

Estimated Box Office Grosses for

Friday, December 3rd, Weekend Number

49, are as follows in millions of

dollars.

PHONE VOICE

Due to the high volume of calls, we

must ask you to wait till a line is

clear...

PHONE VOICE

(again)

Thanks for waiting. Weekend 49 grosses

follow in millions of dollars.

'Belligerence,' 714 theaters. Two-

point-one-eight million, down 46

percent.

PHONE VOICE

(again)

'Best Girl,' 1,820 theaters, six-

point-four million, up 24 percent.

BURKE

(contemptuously)

Cappuccino movies.

PHONE VOICE

Opening this weekend, 'Double Dare

Two,' 1,870 theaters, fourteen-point-

three million.

PHONE VOICE

(again)

'Ground Zero,' 2,110 theaters, no

million, point four thousand dollars.

BURKE

I'm going to pieces...

(whispering)

The picture was budgeted at 21 million

and I spent 49 so they were a little

mad at me to begin with. Now it

doesn't open even with an Arby's

Roast Beef tie-in... I mean, we only

averaged 300 dollars a theater...

they're going to think I'm Woody

Allen.

MATT

I don't think you have to worry about

that.

BURKE

Thanks. But this is private. What

about the exit survey? Did we do

good with any group at all?

NAN'S VOICE

I can't hear you, but--hi, Matt--

that was funny.

MATT

Hi.

NAN'S VOICE

'I don't think you have to worry

about that?'

BURKE

Did we do well with any group at

all?

NAN'S VOICE

Eleven-year-old boys in the South.

NAN'S VOICE

(again)

Burke? Burke? Matt, is he...

BURKE

I'll see you later. Goodbye.

NAN'S VOICE

But, hon...

BURKE

I'm all alone...

(pause)

At least there's that.

MATT

Are you going to need me? The kids

are rehearsing and I'd like to take

a look.

BURKE

Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside

during lunch hours now anyway--that's

when everybody returns my calls

because they're trying to miss me.

MATT

(amazed)

Is that true?

BURKE

(misinterpreting)

Yeah. Thanks for the support.

MATT

I bet I know what it looks like to

you.

JEANNIE

What?

MATT

A giant "find Waldo."

JEANNIE

Very funny.

PASSING VOICE

Five minutes, children, then we need

you for work on the set.

JEANNIE

Set?

MATT

That pretend living room, right over

there.

JEANNIE

Okay. Set. Bye...

MATT

(holding her arm)

Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy

give you a few tips here.

JEANNIE

(twisting away)

Nooo. I've got to get to work.

JEANNIE

(faintly)

Is this the set?

PASSING VOICE

Parents to Room Two, please.

(as he goes by Matt)

Parents to Room Two, please.

PASSING VOICE

(again)

We have to clear the set.

PASSING VOICE

(again)

This way, parents.

CATHY

I'm glad I found you.

MATT

Hi.

CATHY

You holding up? What did you do last

night after I called?

MATT

(as if teasing)

What do you think I did? I cried

like a baby.

CATHY

Okay. Okay. So you don't want to

tell me. Be a tough guy.

MATT

Now you got it.

CATHY

I feel relieved just seeing you after

all that stuff... whew... Okay.

(preparing to go)

Burke wants to...

MATT

You ever go out with him?

CATHY

Yes.

MATT

You slept with him?

CATHY

Yes.

MATT

Did you hate it?

CATHY

Eventually.

MATT

(reeling a bit)

Good Lord.

CATHY

This is the thing that makes me

nervous about you... You keep on

assuming I'm nicer than I am.

JEANNIE

DAD!!

JEANNIE

There's such trouble.

DIRECTOR

She's very worried about being able

to pretend cry when she has to and

she doesn't get it about memorizing.

That's all.

JEANNIE

(aghast)

That's all?!?

JEANNIE

This isn't going to be good.

MATT

Not with that attitude.

MATT

(again)

It's just that they... Well, did

they tell you what an audience is?

JEANNIE

(insulted)

I know what an audience is.

MATT

Good. Now, because there's an

audience, they want you to know all

the words you have to say really

well. And since you can't read yet...

(off her fierce look)

...you're going to have to be patient

and try hard. I can help you.

JEANNIE

Can you help me to cry?

MATT

Yes.

(on her broad disbelief)

I can. I can help make it okay. Trust

me.

JEANNIE

I miss my mother bigger than you

know.

MATT

(to Jeannie)

Not yet. Don't grab.

(into phone)

Thank you. We really appreciate this.

Hi, Beth. I...

JEANNIE

(softly into phone)

Mom? No... Nothing... Nothing...

Nothing. Nothing... Would you talk?

I'd just like to listen to you...

Wait. Let me sit down.

JEANNIE

Dad says he's going to make me to

really cry.

MATT

Jeannie, your mom's not going to

understand what you mean.

JEANNIE

(to Matt)

She understands!!!

(into phone)

He's being terrible right now.

(faster; avoiding

Matt)

I love, loved, the coloring book you

sent me. Goodbye. Wait. I love you.

Let me hang up first. Love you. Send

me a letter. Bye. And a beaded T-

shirt. Bye.

MATT

Why don't you let me be on your side

for a second?

JEANNIE

I can't even understand what you're

saying now.

MATT

Do you know what trust means?

JEANNIE

Not very.

MATT

It means that even if something is

hard to believe, you believe someone

you trust because you know he wouldn't

say it unless it were true.

JEANNIE

I understand. So I don't trust

anybody, right?

MATT

Yeah, I think you get the concept.

JEANNIE

You don't make sense. I don't

understand you.

MATT

I think you do.

MATT

Just know that...

JEANNIE

Okayyyy!

MATT

(giving up)

You want to help me make a phone

call?

MATT

Seven... two...

JEANNIE

(hitting numbers)

Who are we calling?

MATT

Cathy. She's very nice. One... six...

JEANNIE

(hard to read)

"Very nice..." One...

JEANNIE'S VOICE

Hi...

(to Matt)

What now?

JEANNIE'S VOICE

How are you?

CATHY

Jeannie... I can't talk now because...

JEANNIE

Wait, my dad wants to...

CATHY

Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on

the phone with a director...

JEANNIE

He wants to talk to you very much

and...

CATHY

(sharply)

I can't. I have to hang up.

MATT

You have to understand that sometimes

people are too busy.

JEANNIE

So she's too busy for you?

BURKE

We look like jerks eating here this

early. Everybody's going to think we

couldn't get a reservation for the

hot hours.

NAN

Why do you do this to yourself? Why

do you insist on eating dinner in a

restaurant where you're bound to see

all the people you're afraid of?

BURKE

I'm not afraid of them.

NAN

What do you call it when you think

that what a group of people think of

you can confirm or destroy any decent

idea you have of yourself?

BURKE

Normal.

NAN

How did little Jeannie do today?

BURKE

Isn't it something that they have

you testing the TV show?

NAN

What I asked was, how did Jeannie

do?

BURKE

What are you talking about?

NAN

Somebody else. Jeannie. How did she

do?

BURKE

Don't talk to me like this.

NAN

(really pissed)

I want to be treated as if I'm really

saying words to you which you engage

and respond to. I like Matt; I'd

like to know how his daughter did.

So before you take your dance of

desperation across the restaurant

and I end up feeling so sorry for

you that I could die, I would like

you to answer my question.

BURKE

She did okay... and don't worry about

Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid

will be making five thousand a week.

So what do you know about 'People

Get Hurt?'

NAN

I'm told that they're not going to

release it...

BURKE

I knew. I knew. What the hell are

you smiling for?

NAN

Forgive me. But telling you about

this latest failure of yours--it

pleases me. I have no idea why.

BURKE

I can't be with someone who's not

rooting for me.

NAN

I think I am. It's just that rooting

for you is a good deal more

complicated than you realize.

(as he rises)

Don't go.

BURKE

Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I

gotta do this.

BURKE

(again)

Sorry. I thought you were someone

else.

BURKE

Nan, you know Victor and his wife...

(he mumbles, unable

to remember any wife's

name)

and Jay and his wife...

(he mumbles)

NAN

Yes. I'm sorry I can't talk now. I'm

very upset about what's happening to

Burke, so I just made up my mind I

can't be witness to it anymore if I

love him and I certainly shouldn't

be here if I don't... so I was just

in the process of leaving when he

stopped me and you folks walked in...

I'm sure you've had something like

this happen to you some time... some

horrible thing in your personal life

happening in public.

NAN

(again)

Thank you for understanding.

(to Burke)

Goodbye. I wish only good things for

you even though I feel I've been

really damaged by this relationship.

COUPLES

Wasn't that spectacular? I've never

seen anybody that secure...

BURKE

Thank you. Thank you. We're very

close.

NAN

You don't understand that I'm

exhausted from hurting. I'm through

with you.

BURKE

(to restaurant patrons)

Excuse me, we're working our shit

out... I'm sure it happened to you...

you know, private stuff in public.

JEANNIE

I don't know if I've been bad. I

know somebody's been bad.

(hopefully)

...maybe it's you.

JEANNIE

Oh, I love you so much, I love you

so much... I love you so much.

MATT

(as Black woman)

I hope that makes you feel a whole

lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure

goes a long way to cure what ails

me.

JEANNIE

I can't believe I...

MATT

(as himself, coaching)

...got in this much...

JEANNIE

...got in this much trouble. .

MATT

Right. Over a...

JEANNIE

(guessing)

Word?

MATT

Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this

much trouble over a word.' Now do

you know what she means when she

says that?

JEANNIE

I don't want to talk about it--just

say her stuff so I know mine.

MATT

No.

MATT

It's your choice... But I'm not

helping unless you try to understand

as well as memorize. It will be fun.

Come on. I know it's hard...

JEANNIE

Okay. Okay...

MATT

Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay,

this little girl you're pretending

to be... she can't be with her Mommy

either, just like you, or her

father... she has to stay in Rainbow

House which is called that because...

(Jeannie starts

fidgeting)

Jeannie...

(she stops)

...because everyone's a different

color... so when this little girl

calls the black lady who takes care

of all the children this terrible

word... it's like the worst thing

anybody can do... Come here.

JEANNIE

(approaching him)

I don't want to do the 'I love you'

again.

MATT

Yeah, I might have been working you

too hard on that one.

JEANNIE

Yeah. Why don't you do that with

poopie Cathy?

MATT

(ignoring her)

Now, did the director tell you how

he wanted you to do it?

JEANNIE

He said to smile all the time almost

and to talk... uh...

MATT

Faster?

JEANNIE

Yes.

MATT

Okay. We don't always get good

directors, so it's important for

us...

JEANNIE

Me. You're not in the show.

MATT

I'm referring to the family of actors,

you little shithead.

JEANNIE

This is so good...

MATT

It's a breakfast burrito. It's what

actors eat when they're working.

JEANNIE

(excited)

Really.

MATT

Now, let's work a little more. The

most important acting you do is when

you listen. You're worried about

being able to cry when you're supposed

to, right?

JEANNIE

Yes. So much.

MATT

Well, there are really only two ways

to do it. Think of something that

makes you really sad... or forget

you're you and really forget you're

pretending...

JEANNIE

How do I do that one?

MATT

(as a furious Black

woman)

'Don't test me, child! I could eat

you for lunch when I was your age

and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!'

MATT

That's it... You just looked at me

and acted right without even thinking.

And there are games you can play to

help you with this. Get up...

(she does)

Now, be my mirror... do exactly what

I do... that's it... now, at a certain

point, I'm going to become your

mirror, but I'm not going to tell

you when... you tell me...

JEANNIE

(hesitantly)

Now?

MATT

(enthusiastically)

Okay. We're going to make up words.

The words aren't what matter now.

JEANNIE

I'm on a roof...

MATT

You're a great dad.

JEANNIE

You're a...

(then stops; then

smiles at him)

A.D.

They need you.

JEANNIE

Okay.

MATT

You're welcome. Don't mention it.

MATT

I'm a free man. Let's go to your

house and break the answering machine.

CATHY

You know, I could get away now. But

I've got a big meeting later. We'd

better take two cars.

CATHY

See you later. Thanks again.

MATT

I hope it's you.

CATHY'S VOICE ON SPEAKER

Hi.

MATT

(delighted)

So this is how the big ones make

out.

CATHY'S VOICE

Matt, will you take me off the

speaker?

MATT

What's the matter?

CATHY

(hyper)

I don't know whether I'm being a

coward for telling you this way or

brave for telling you period... Can

you hear me?

MATT

Yes.

CATHY

But I better talk fast because this

is where my phone always kicks out...

When we did your screentest... Can

you hear me?

MATT

Yes.

CATHY

Well, I sort of folded on you at the

end.

CATHY

Matt?

MATT

You didn't like what I did?

CATHY

I did. Truly. But the discussion got

sort of dumb. It was a question of

sexiness.

MATT

That's what it came down to?

CATHY

Well, sort of, yes.

MATT

You folded on whether or not I'm

sexy. You don't think I'm sexy...

and you expressed that to...

CATHY

Well, I'll tell you. I certainly

must think so pretty much because I

feel great about where we're going

now...

CATHY

Are you very mad at me?

MATT

No. You were just... Aw, damn it, I

am. Very. Yes.

FIRST VOICE

...number seven at the box office

this week-end is...

VOICE NUMBER TWO

...the two words are Tom Cruise.

THIRD VOICE

...becoming the first lawyer to be

awarded his own star on Hollywood

Boule...

BURKE

Hello, Nan. I hope it's not too late

to call.

BURKE

I'd like another chance.

NAN

You only think you feel that way

because you're on the verge of failure

and you're without a core...

BURKE

See. Nobody else gets me.

(a beat then)

You wanna have a little sex, honey?

NAN

(a beat then)

You know I've never hung up on anybody

in my life... because what if the

next thing they said solved

everything... but I must end this

conversation.

MATT

Hello.

BURKE

Hi, Matt, this is Burke. I'm sorry

to bother you at home, but you know

Nan... We were going out a little

and I could use another guy's slant

on what's just happened.

MATT

I don't think I can get into this...

BURKE

Why? Did I catch you at a bad time?

MATT

Worse. You caught me at a bad time

you caused.

BURKE

Oh, you mean about the screentest.

The whole room thought you did good

work.

MATT

(reinventing irony)

Thanks.

BURKE

Yeah, look, I'm not going to bother

you about my thing.

MATT

Yeah. Okay, good night.

WARM-UP MAN

...pilot for a new show called

'Rainbow House'. Just listen to our

more and make you love me...

...and when you're in the audience,

make sure you laugh and applaud even

when it's somebody else's kid...

A.D.

(again)

You're not allowed near the stage.

We only have a few minutes...

A.D.

Let me know if you see the little

white girl.

MATT

Jeannie.

MATT

Just remember. You're not even here

tonight. There's only this other

little girl that you're pretending

to be who lives at Rainbow House.

JEANNIE

...and who just vomited.

JEANNIE

I just found out that we bow before

we even do anything.

MATT

Great.

JEANNIE

And everybody claps.

MATT

Great.

JEANNIE

I made up a great bow. You going to

look?

MATT

Wouldn't miss it.

JEANNIE

I'm not going to be able to cry.

It's too hard for me.

MATT

Hey, then they'll just give you more

chances after everyone leaves.

BURKE

Look at you. You're all here because

of what's on the line for me tonight.

Having this many people in your corner

helps more than I would have ever

guessed. I'm just very grateful that

I made you come.

CATHY

Matt. Matt. Matt.

MATT

I don't want to miss her introduction.

CATHY

I'll talk fast. It's amazing news.

Oliver Stone's been looking for a

comedy and...

MATT

(distracted)

I've got to see my kid.

CATHY

(her voice breaking)

...he's doing my picture.

MATT

Hey. Good.

CATHY

Part of this involves you. He

remembers you from 'Platoon' and

wants to use you in this one.

(he stops)

Got your attention, huh?

MATT

Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch

this. Let me talk to you later or

tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's

good news. Gotta go.

WARM-UP MAN'S VOICE

First, in her first appearance ever,

Jeannie Hobbs...

MATT

Shit.

CATHY

I'm sorry.

MATT

Why couldn't you wait till later?

Shit.

CATHY

(broadly)

I guess it's because I'm just

incredibly insensitive to all human

needs. I'd ask you to save me, but

I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you

to waste your time.

MATT

(after a moment)

Huh?

CATHY

You know, I don't have a kid or a

mate or a talent.

(holding up book bag)

I got this.

(she's quite upset)

And shoot me if I think it's

important.

CATHY

You think I'm a superficial jerk.

(and then a whispered

afterthought)

You can't be right.

MATT

I think you're the best of the bunch.

CATHY

(broadly)

Oh, great.

BURKE

(to Matt)

What do you think?

MATT

(wide-eyed)

Wait. This is it.

JEANNIE

It's like everyone is pi... ticked

off at me because I'm not colored.

SHORT WHITE MAN

(correcting her

pompously)

The word is black.

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

(correcting him with

booming voice)

The word is African American.

BURKE

I had them bring in two busloads of

people from black churches.

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

(scolding Jeannie)

Now you use it in a sentence.

JEANNIE

Look at me, I...

WHOLE AUDIENCE

Awwwww.

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

Go ahead. Use it in a sentence.

JEANNIE

(crying fully)

Look at me. I love an African

American.

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

Look at me. I love a little redneck.

MATT

(pridefully)

You little stinker!

JEANNIE

You big stinker.

MATT

My little stinker.

JEANNIE

My big stinker.

FLOOR MANAGER

It's okay, Jeannie. Take a minute.

We just need to get that hug at the

end.

MATT

(to Floor Manager)

Amazing, right?

FLOOR MANAGER

(to Jeannie)

You were great.

JEANNIE

Thank you. That's nice.

MATT

You look happy.

JEANNIE

I loved it, Daddy.

MATT

You want me to put you down?

JEANNIE

No. This is okay.

MATT

Okay... Now, you're not finished

until you hug the lady just like you

did me.

MATT

I'm very proud of you. I love you

more than anybody.

JEANNIE

When I had to cry, I thought of you

buried in the ground.

MATT

(a beat, then)

Give me a kiss.

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

Do you have any idea how special you

were?

(on Jeannie's goony

reaction)

That looks like a 'yes.' You've got

to get dressed for the party.

JEANNIE

(overwhelmed)

There's more?

(then)

What will I wear?

BLACK LEAD ACTRESS

Go to wardrobe; they'll give you

anything you want.

NAN

It didn't sell.

MATT

This show didn't sell?!? How do you

know so fast?

NAN

It's the first time they had me do

cards for a pilot and the demographics

are all wrong for after nine o'clock.

That's their only opening.

NAN

Hi. I'm Nan. I'm a good friend of

your Dad's.

JEANNIE

Hello, Nan. I'm Jeannie. Did you see

it?

NAN

(to Jeannie)

Yes, and you were wonderful.

(aside to Matt)

89 percent likeability.

(to Jeannie)

And knowing that you were that good

means so much more than the show not

going.

JEANNIE

What?

NAN

Oh, no.

(to Matt)

I couldn't help it.

JEANNIE

What does she mean?

(to Nan)

What do you mean?

(to Matt)

What does she mean?

(to Nan)

What do you mean?

MATT

That they're not going to be doing

any more of these shows right now--

but...

JEANNIE

(struck)

Oh, my God.

MATT

Honey...

JEANNIE

And that means they're not going to

have a party?

MATT

No. They're still having the party.

JEANNIE

(totally relieved)

Oh... really?... good... can we stay

late?

MATT

Honey, we're going to close the place.

MILLIE

I cast him so he has to dance with

me, but I'm sure he'd prefer dancing

with you.

BOY

(to Jeannie)

Come on. You know how?

JEANNIE

(angrily, with disdain)

Yesssssss.

BURKE

I'm not comfortable with television

anyway... it's too small... I'm much

better at something with size... I

don't do itzy. Even this movie of

Cathy's--it's small... medium small.

But with Stone it takes on a certain

volume where I start to feel

comfortable.

(out of nowhere)

I hate my life...

(backtracking)

...in a way. I had a drink in my

office. I'm confused. You're not

saying anything. Is it because you're

not listening or because I haven't

stopped talking?

MATT

This Oliver Stone thing... does he

really want me?

BURKE

Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say

congratu...

MATT

Which part?

BURKE

Which one you want?

MATT

One of the two leads wouldn't be

bad.

BURKE

No. It's the crippled factory owner.

MATT

Best part in the movie.

BURKE

Wait a second.

MATT

I want to see my kid.

BURKE

A second--look, they're taking the

cast picture now anyway.

BURKE

She doesn't look anything like the

women I usually go with. And you

know what they say, "beauty fades."

What they don't say is that it fades

very slowly.

MATT

You don't think I can tell you what

to do?

BURKE

No. Only I can do that. I want you

to tell me what to feel...

(he begins to use his

fingers to run down

Nan's qualities)

Look. I trust her. More important,

everyone does. You have no idea how

impressed people are with her. She's

smart. She's interesting. You never

know what she'll say next... Her

work is amazing. I like talking to

her. You have no idea what to expect

next. I respect what she does more

than any writer or director--sincerely--

much more unusual--much more

important. So?

MATT

Good luck.

BURKE

Dance with me.

(she shakes her head)

On a business basis.

NAN

No.

(he turns away,

dejected)

But I'll dance with you because I

think it will reassure me that I

should have nothing to do with you.

BURKE

I'll take it.

NAN

Why are you breathing so heavy?

BURKE

Nervous... Look, let's move our thing

in a more regular direction.

NAN

What do you mean?

BURKE

Let me think.

(then)

What if we go out this weekend...

(before she can say

"no")

...with your kid.

NAN

...whose name is?

BURKE

Whose name is...

(then, triumphantly)

Leslie.

NAN

Okay.

DISSOLVE TO:

JEANNIE

(looking around

satisfied)

Last ones here.

MATT

Well, I told you.

MATT

I never got to see your bow.

JEANNIE

(as if it's a great

sacrifice)

Oh, all right.

FADE OUT:

THE END
