"GHOST WORLD"

by

DANIEL CLOWES

and

TERRY ZWIGOFF

SPEAKER

High school is like the training

wheels for the bicycle of real life.

It is a time for young people to

explore different fields of interest

and to hopefully grow from their

experiences.  After all, that which

we learn from our mistakes can be as

valuable as what we learn from our

textbooks, and often we can turn the

negative experiences that are common

to all high-schoolers into positive

steps toward personal growth and

achievement. In coming to terms with

my own personal setback, which I'm

sure you've all heard about, I've

been able to learn a lot about myself.

I've learned for one thing that I

don't need to rely on drugs and

alcohol

(APPLAUSE)

and that I'm very lucky-that more

people besides Carrie and myself

weren't hurt in the accident; I've

learned that I'm blessed with

wonderful parents, teachers and above

all the best classmates in the world --

I love each and every one of you

guys!!

(APPLAUSE)

and I've learned that to get through

life's obstacles you need faith,

hope and, most of all, a sense of

humor.

(BIG APPLAUSE)

EBONY

No more eduCATION...

VANILLA

It's time for celeBRATION...

JADE

'cause this is the day of our high

school GraduATION...

EBONY

We've stayed for the durATION...

VANILLA

Achieved matricuLATION...

JADE

Now we're the newest members of the

general popuLATION...

ENID

God, what a bunch of retards...

REBECCA

I thought Chipmunk-face was never

going to shut up.

ENID

I know, I liked her better when she

was an alcoholic crack addict! She

gets in one car wreck and all of a

sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and

everybody loves her.

REBECCA

It's totally sickening.

(she unrolls her

DIPLOMA)

Let's see if they gave me the right

diploma...

ENID

What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!

REBECCA

What?

ENID

These assholes are saying that I

have to go to Summer school and take

some stupid art class!

REBECCA

Why?

ENID

Remember that stupid hippie art

teacher who failed me sophomore year?

I didn't think that just because you

get an "F" that means you have to

take the class over again.

REBECCA

You loser.

REBECCA

(watching band)

This is so bad, it's almost good.

ENID

This is so bad it's gone past good

and back to bad again...

ENID

Just think, we'll never have to see

any of these creepy faces ever again.

REBECCA

Unless they're in your Summer school

class!

ENID

Shut up!

REBECCA

Uh oh... don't turn around...

ENID

What? Why?

REBECCA

Forget it...

MELORRA

Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe

we made it!

ENID

Yeah, we graduated high school --

how totally amazing.

MELORRA

So what are you guys doing this

Summer?

ENID

Nothing.

MELORRA

I'm going to be in this actor's

workshop, and I'm hoping to start

going on auditions soon. I'm so

excited to finally have some free

time. We have to get together this

summer!

ENID

Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

MELORRA

(spotting better people

to talk to)

Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!

ENID

Since when is she an "actress"?

REBECCA

I know, she needs to die immediately.

TODD

Hey Rebecca!

REBECCA

Oh... hi...

TODD

(pause)

So... we finally --

ENID

What about me? Am I not even here?

TODD

Oh, hey Enid...

(starting over)

So... we finally made it!

REBECCA

Yep.

TODD

(awkward pause)

So... where are you going to college?

ENID

(before Rebecca can

answer)

We're not.

TODD

Really? Both of you?... Why not?

ENID

Just because.

REBECCA

We have other plans.

TODD

I guess I should have figured that

you two would do something different.

ENID

What are you going to be when you

grow up, Todd?

TODD

Well I'm going to major in Business

Administration and, I think, minor

in Communications.

ENID

See, that's exactly the kind of thing

we're trying to avoid.

(pause)

TODD

So... I --

ENID

Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler

going out with Rod Harbaugh?

REBECCA

How perfect.

ENID

He better watch out or he'll get

AIDS when he date-rapes her.

ENID

God, just think, we'll never see

Dennis again.

REBECCA

Good.

ENID

God, think about that... that's

actually totally depressing.

REBECCA

Hi.

ENID

Look at these people behind you.

I'm totally convinced they're

Satanists.

REBECCA

Why?

ENID

Just look at them!

REBECCA

So, when are we going to start looking

for our apartment?

ENID

Soon... I have to wait and see how

this Summer class goes.

REBECCA

Did you sign up yet?

ENID

Yeah, I just picked the one that

sounded the easiest.

REBECCA

God, it's so weird that we're finally

out of high school... We've been

waiting for this our whole life! Now

we can get our own apartment and do

anything we want.  It's such a weird

feeling.

ENID

I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.

JOHN

Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca,

the little Jewish girl and her Aryan

friend.

ENID

You're late, asshole.

JOHN

Fine, and how are you?

ENID

Did you bring that tape?

JOHN

You never paid me for that tape with

the Indian dance routine.

ENID

I did too!

JOHN

Tsk! You Jews are so clever with

money...

ENID

Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

REBECCA

Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!

ENID

We should follow them!

REBECCA

Totally... Oh my God, look!

ENID

(to John)

Thanks for the tape - I'll have to

pay you later, I'm broke.

JOHN

Hey, where are you going?

ENID

Later, "Dude".

REBECCA

Much later.

ENID

In fact, never.

REBECCA

What do you do if you're a satanist,

anyway?

ENID

You know, sacrifice virgins and

stuff...

REBECCA

That lets us off the hook.

ENID

Maybe there's some weird secret

satanic society that meets at the

Quality Cafe and all of the other

regular customers are in on it except

for us.

REBECCA

Or maybe not.

ENID

Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or

they're planning to brainwash us and --

REBECCA

Okay, okay!

ENID

Hey, look at this...

ENID

"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when

were there mini-malls in the 1950's?

REBECCA

God, it's so totally pathetic.

REBECCA

Who can forget this great hit from

the 50's?

ENID

I feel as though I've stepped into a

time warp!

REBECCA

Check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo

on the waiter.

WAITER

Hi, my name is Allen, and I'll be

your waiter this afternoon.

ENID

Hi, Al!

REBECCA

Can we call you "Weird Al"?

WAITER

Heh heh. Our specials today are pasta

Vasilio, which is a pasta salad with

a light basil vinaigrette--

ENID

That was a popular dish in the 50's,

huh Weird Al?

AL

I imagine so! Also, we have a spinach

tortellini in a ricotta sauce. Both

of those are $6.95... shall I give

you a few minutes to mull it over?

ENID

I just want an order of onion rings.

REBECCA

I might actually get the pasta

special.

ENID

You loser!

AL

Pasta special and an order of onion

rings. Very good.

ENID

Did you notice all those weird things

on the menu? Like "The Salad

Explosion"?

REBECCA

I know... and instead of "dessert"

it says "Mindbenders."

ENID

What does that even mean?

REBECCA

Check out the Personals... maybe our

future husbands are trying to contact

us.

ENID

God, this paper is so boring. Who

reads all this shit?

(flips through it

until she gets to

the Personals)

Here we go...

(reading)

"Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ,

maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the

clubs, make each other laugh!"

REBECCA

You can have that one.

ENID

Okay, well here's yours...

(reading)

"Who said all the most eligible

bachelors are taken? Not this one!

Stunning bod, very snugglelicious

ocean sunset dreamer."

REBECCA

Gross.

AL

Can I get you ladies anything else,

or are you all set?

ENID

Later I might be interested in one

of those far-out "mindbenders."

ENID

Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you

remember me? Airport shuttle, June

7th. You: striking redhead with yellow

dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes.

I was the bookish fellow in the green

cardigan who helped you find your

contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we

have a moment?"

REBECCA

God, that's so pathetic. I bet she

didn't even notice him.

ENID

I know. And he's like psychotically

obsessing over every little detail.

REBECCA

We should call him and pretend to be

the redhead.

ENID

Oh, we totally have to.

NASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.)

So what happened next, Donna?

DONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.)

Then I told him he'd better take out

his hose and pump me!

NASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.)

Don-na?!

DONNA (V.O.)

You guys! My car was out of gas!

ENID

(whispers)

Does Oomie really like this show?

REBECCA

(whispers)

Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

OOMIE

Girls! Shh!

REBECCA

So what should we do?

ENID

Wait... I just want to see what's on

this tape.

REBECCA

What is this?

ENID

I dunno. John Ellis always puts on

all this sick stuff that I have to

fast-forward past to get to the good

stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don

Knotts movie on here someplace.

REBECCA

Wait, what is that?

ENID & REBECCA

EEEEWWWW!

ENID

Hey - why do you have this?

REBECCA

You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

ENID

I've been looking all over for this.

ENID

Look at how cute I am!

REBECCA

What a little hosebag.

ENID

Look, that's back when I hated you.

REBECCA

I remember every minute of that party.

ENID

(another page)

There's my dad with Joanie.

REBECCA

I can never keep them all straight -

was she the super-bitch?

ENID

No, she was the second wife. The

third one was the super-bitch -

Maxine.

(finds a picture)

There! Look at her!

ENID

What a fucking monster!

REBECCA

Oh my God! This is that comedian I

was telling you about! You have to

see this guy -- he's the absolute

worst!

JOEY

Just because I live with my mother

people think I'm peculiar... so what

if she's been dead for fifteen years!

Hehn hehn...

(Peter Lorre laugh)

REBECCA (V.O.)

God, that's barely even a joke.

JOEY

As I always say, take my life...

please!

ENID (V.O.)

If he's supposed to be so weird, how

come he's wearing Nikes?

ANNOUNCER

Joey McCobb, ladies and gentlemen...

Joey McCobb!

(APPLAUSE)

ENID

Joey McCobb is our God.

REBECCA

I want to do him!

ENID

I bet! Actually he reminds me of

that one creep you went out with --

you always go for guys with some

lame, fake shtick.

REBECCA

What are you talking about -- who?

ENID

That Larry guy -- what look was he

going for? A gay tennis player from

the forties?

REBECCA

Fuck you!

REBECCA

Hey! We forgot to call the loser!

ENID

Which loser?

REBECCA

You know, the green cardigan guy.

ENID

Oh yeah.

REBECCA

You call.

ENID

Why do I always have to do it?

REBECCA

You're better at it.

ENID

(as she dials)

I remember when I first started

reading these I thought DWF stood

for "dwarf!"

REBECCA

(ear up to phone)

What does it stand for?

ENID

Shh, it's his answering machine...

(pause)

We hear the indistinct traces of a

musical message followed by a faint

BEEP.

ENID

Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde."

Of course I remember you.  Let's get

together for lunch sometime... How

about Friday at one o'clock?... Why

don't you meet me at my favorite

restaurant, "Wowsville"... It's in

the mall on Century Parkway... I'll

see you there, darling... and be

sure to wear that sexy green

cardigan...

BOSS

AH AH AH! What you think you doing?

You still got five minutes left on

you shift!

ENID

Well hello there, young employee of

the Sidewinder.

JOSH

Look, I already told you I'm not

going to give you a ride.

ENID

What can you tell me, young man,

about the various flavors of "frozen

yogurt"?

JOSH

Look, I'll be done in a minute.

Just wait outside.

ENID

I'm afraid I don't understand. I

simply wish to know --

BOSS

JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

JOSH

(SIGHS)

The flavors we're featuring this

week, in addition to old favorites

chocolate and vanilla, are Six-Gun

Strawberry, Wild Cherry Round-up,

and Ten Gallon Tangerine.

ENID

I don't believe I care for any of

those.

DOUG

Hey, Josh... I need two packs of

smokes. I'm on a double shift

tonight... fuckin' sixteen hours,

man.

DOUG

Hey, and gimme six of these beef

jerkys too - I'm hungry enough to

chew the crotch out of a rag doll!

BOSS

Hey! I told you: No shirt, no service!

DOUG

(as he leaves)

Fuck you, man!

ENID

So Josh...

JOSH

Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm

almost done.

REBECCA

(nudging Enid, points

outside)

Look at this!

BOSS

You get out of here!

ENID

That guy rules!

JOSH

Who, Doug? He spends more time here

than I do...

ENID

So Josh, will you give us a ride?

Please? Pretty please? It's going to

be super fun!

JOSH

No.

REBECCA

Please Josh?

JOSH

Forget it, there's no way... find

some other poor sucker to abuse.

JOSH

Why do you even need a ride? You

could walk there in two minutes.

ENID

It's just an excuse for us to spend

time with you.

REBECCA

So Josh, if this guy freaks out,

will you protect us?

JOSH

He has every reason to freak out --

this is a totally fucked-up thing to

do to somebody!

ENID

God, I think Josh is too mature for

us.

REBECCA

I know, look at the way he drives...

he's like an old man.

ENID

Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!

REBECCA

Look, maybe that's him!

ENID

It's still twenty-five minutes early.

JOSH

Aren't there a million places like

this?

ENID

This is the ultimate. It's like the

Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.

JOSH

So, where's "Weird Al"?

ENID

SHH! He's back there. I can see his

hair bobbing up and down.

REBECCA

I want to "make love" to him.

ENID

I'm going to tell him you said that.

AL

So nice to see you again, ladies.

ENID

Hey, Weird Al, there's something my

friend wants to tell you --

REBECCA

SHUT UP!

ENID

She says she wants to MMPH!

CUT TO:

ENID

So Josh... Becky and I are trying to

figure out what makes you tick.

Tell us about your political beliefs.

JOSH

Yeah, right.

ENID

No, I'm serious. Give us your whole

basic philosophy in a nutshell.

REBECCA

Oh my God, look, that's got to be

him!

ENID

Is he wearing a green cardigan?

REBECCA

What exactly is a cardigan anyway?

ENID

That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking

me out.

JOSH

In answer to your question, I suppose

I endorse policies that are opposed

to stupidity and violence and cruelty

in any form...

ENID

I figured something like that...

REBECCA

Oh my God!

ENID

It's obviously him!

REBECCA

I can't believe it!

REBECCA

What's going on now? What's he doing?

ENID

Oh my god, he just ordered a giant

glass of milk!

JOSH

(bursting her bubble)

It's a vanilla milkshake.

REBECCA

What's he doing now?

ENID

He's still just sitting there. God,

this is totally unbearable!

JOSH

I agree.

REBECCA

I wish I could see him.

ENID

Go ahead and look, but don't make it

too obvious...

REBECCA

Do you think he knows?

ENID

I dunno...

ENID

Hey Weird Al, did that guy say

anything to you before he left?

AL

Not a thing.

AL

(cheerfully

professional despite

her abuse)

Thank you and come again.

JOSH

Jesus, look at this guy.

ENID

Oh my God, that's HIM!

REBECCA

Are you sure?

ENID

Totally! Look!

ENID

He's insane!

REBECCA

We should follow him home.

JOSH

Forget it.

ENID

Come on, Josh... don't you want to

see where he lives?

JOSH

No.

ENID

But this guy is like a one-of-kind,

rare butterfly, and we have to follow

him back to his natural habitat...

JOSH

You need counseling.

REBECCA

God, he lives right in our

neighborhood!

ENID

He doesn't even look that bummed

out, really.

REBECCA

I know... wouldn't you be totally

pissed off?

ENID

This kind of thing must happen to

him all the time.

WOMAN'S VOICE

(cheap echo effect)

Returning to the house of my

Fatherfatherfatherfather...

ROBERTA

That piece is entitled

"Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to

show it to people I'm meeting for

the first time because it says so

much about who I am and what it feels

like to inhabit my specific skin.

And this is exactly what I'm hoping

to get from each of you over the

course of this Summer: a picture of

your own self-exploration. My own

background is in video and performance

art, but I'm hoping that doesn't

influence you and that you'll find

your own ways of externalizing the

internal. At the end of the Summer,

this class has been invited, along

with several others in the area, to

participate in a show of High-School

art at the Neighborhood Activity

Center. The title of the show will

be "Brotherhood and Community: Art

as Dialogue." I think the

"Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely

with the theme of self-discovery

that I'd like to emphasize in this

class. Are there any questions so

far?

(she's completely

lost them)

Great...

ENID

This is way too creepy.

REBECCA

He won't see us... we'll just stalk

him from a distance.

ENID

I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start

feeling really bad again.

ENID

So what should we do? We can't just

hide all day waiting for him to come

out...

ENID

This is girl mail.

ENID

This is all computer catalogues and

stuff...

REBECCA

The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...

(she flips through

the mail)

Oh my God, The National Psoriasis

Foundation!

ENID

Bingo!

REBECCA

Wait! Do you hear that?

ENID

Shit!

REBECCA

What should we do? What if he

recognizes us?

ENID

Come on, it's too late now...

ENID

Ew, look at this...

REBECCA

Gross!

ENID

I think it's cute - look at his little

weasel teeth.

REBECCA

Ew, it's like some gross rat...

JOE

(hardly looking up

from TV)

It's a mongoose.

REBECCA

Mm...

ENID

A what?

JOE

A mongoose... they eat snakes... you

never heard of a mongoose?  That's a

classic piece of vintage taxidermy.

Nobody alive today knows how to do

work like that.

ENID

(looking underneath

it)

How much is this?

JOE

Umm... That's not officially for

sale... I might have to hang onto

that for the time being.

JOE

So, are you looking for anything in

particular? There's a lot of other

stuff in storage...

JOE

Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to

you.  Absolutely no practice

necessary.  You shread like a giant.

Just press a button.

ENID

That's okay...

ENID

Do you have any other old records

besides these?

JOE

Seymour does.

ENID

Who does?

JOE

Him. Seymour. He's the man with the

records.

ENID

Do you have any old Indian records?

SEYMOUR

Indian records?

ENID

You know, like weird 1960's Indian

rock n' roll music.

SEYMOUR

I don't have anything after about

1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from

the twenties in my collection, but

it's not really for sale. I don't

really collect "foreign."

SEYMOUR

Those are all 78s... Can you play

78s?

ENID

Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I

can play regular records...

SEYMOUR

There's some good stuff in here...

do you like old music?

ENID

Sure, I guess.

SEYMOUR

Well there's a few choice LPs in

here that re-issue some really great

old blues stuff.

ENID

Is this one any good?

SEYMOUR

Nah, it's not so great. Here's the

one I'd recommend.

SEYMOUR

This track alone by Memphis Minnie

is worth about $500 if you have the

original 78. She was one of the

greatest guitar players that ever

lived, and a great singer and

songwriter as well. I know the guy

who owns the original and lent it

for use on this reissue.

ENID

Wow!

ENID

How much is it?

SEYMOUR

A dollar seventy-five.

ENID

Okay.

SEYMOUR

If you don't like it bring it back

for a refund. We're here every

Saturday.

ENID

I'm sure it's fine.

REBECCA

That was truly pathetic.

ENID

I know... I still can't get over

that his name was "Seymour."

REBECCA

He was so excited when you bought

that record -- you're a saint!...

God, these apartments are super

expensive...

ENID

It was so cute how he had his own

little bags. I thought I was going

to start crying!... Do you think

they're gay?

REBECCA

What about the "striking redhead in

the yellow dress"?

ENID

Oh yeah...

REBECCA

He should totally just kill himself...

Hey, here's one

(circles it)

...Oh wait...

(crosses it out)

you have to share it with a non

smoking feminist and her two cats...

ENID

I dunno... I kind of like him...

He's the exact opposite of everything

I really hate... In a way he's such

a clueless dork that he's almost

cool...

REBECCA

That guy is many things but he

definitely isn't "cool"... This one

would be okay, but there's no

kitchen...

ENID

Yeah, but... you know what I mean.

REBECCA

Not really...

ENID

Forget it, I can't explain it...

MELORRA

Oh my god, what are you guys doing

here?

ENID

What are you doing here, Melorra?

MELORRA

My acting workshop is across the

street from here. I'm just on my

break.

ENID

Well, we won't keep you.

MELORRA

I love this place... it's so - you

know, "funky."

MELORRA

What are you guys up to?

REBECCA

We're looking for an apartment.

MELORRA

God how cool. Where are you moving?

ENID

We're not sure yet, that's why we're

looking.

REBECCA

Somewhere downtown.

MELORRA

God that's so exciting!

(looks at clock)

Oops, I should go. Bye you guys!

Call me.

REBECCA

"Funky"?

ENID

What, is she black now?

REBECCA

I've been thinking about when we

look for our apartment how we have

to try and convince people that we're

like these totally rich yuppies...

ENID

What are you talking about?

REBECCA

That's who people want to rent to.

It's a known fact that it's way easier

to get a job and everything if you're

rich... All we have to do is buy a

few semi-expensive outfits and act

like it's no big deal... it'll be

fun.

ENID

You just want an excuse to dress

like some stupid fashion model without

me making fun of you.

REBECCA

Just promise you'll do it.

ENID

Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're

out of your mind.

DAD

(over music)

Have you seen my blue spatula?

ENID

Nope. What are you making, pancakes?

DAD

Not if I don't find that goddamn

spatula.

REBECCA

(disdainful)

When did you do that?

ENID

What? How long have you been standing

there?

REBECCA

Did you have to buy new hair dye or

did you still have some left over

from eighth grade?

ENID

Fuck you, bitch!

ENID

We still have to go in there sometime.

REBECCA

It's always closed...

ENID

I bet they have tons of incredible

shoes hidden in the back.

ENID

Hey look, it's the pants.

REBECCA

Where are we going?

ENID

Let's go hassle Josh.

REBECCA

"Hassle"?

REBECCA

There he is...

ENID

As always.

REBECCA

Waiting for the bus that never

comes...

ENID

I wonder if he's just totally insane

and he really thinks a bus is coming

or --

REBECCA

Why don't you ask him.

ENID

Hi... what's your name?

MAN

(looks at watchless

wrist, then down the

street)

Norman.

ENID

...are you waiting for a bus?

MAN

Yes.

ENID

I hate to tell you this but they

cancelled this bus line two years

ago... There are no buses on this

street.

MAN

You don't know what you're talking

about.

ENID

JOSH!

REBECCA

JOSH!

ENID & REBECCA

JOSH!

ENID

He's probably in there jerking off.

REBECCA

I'll bet he never jerks off...

ENID

Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like

that.

REBECCA

Should we leave a note?

ENID

Do you have a pen?

REBECCA

You're not really going to leave

that are you?

REBECCA

Why are we going here? I hate this

place.

ENID

It'll only take a second.

CREEP #1

-- I'm telling you, you're wrong --

carpet beetles are the only way to

get the flesh off a corpse...  Boiling

is strictly for amateurs!

ENID

Don't you creeps ever talk about

anything nice? Don't you ever talk

about fluffy kittens or the Easter

Bunny?

CREEP #1

Look who's talking - little miss

badass...

CREEP #2

Yeah, nice outfit - who are you

supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper?

ENID

Blow me, doofus!

JOHN ELLIS

Didn't they tell you?

ENID

Tell me what?

JOHN ELLIS

Punk rock is over!

ENID

I know it's over, asshole, I --

JOHN ELLIS

If you really want to "fuck up the

system" - you should go to business

school -- that's what I'm gonna do:

get a job at some big corporation

and fuck things up from the inside!

ENID

That's not even --

JOHN ELLIS

Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?

JOHN ELLIS

Oh, how "punk."

ENID

That tape sucked, by the way!

JOHN ELLIS

I'm so sorry if you were offended!

ENID

Go die, asshole!

JOHN ELLIS

Get a job!

REBECCA

What was that all about?

ENID

It's not like I'm some modern Punk

dickhead... It's obviously supposed

to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess

Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get

it!

REBECCA

I didn't get it either.

ENID

Everybody's too stupid!

ENID

Yeah, it took a while before I got a

chance to play it, but when I heard

that song it was like --

SEYMOUR

So you really liked it? Yeah, there's

some really rare performances. You

liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?

ENID

Yeah, that's good too... the whole

record was good, but that one song,

"Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly

just keep playing that one over and

over... Do you have any other records

like that?

SEYMOUR

The Skip James record? Yeah, that's

a masterpiece. There are no other

records like that! I actually have

the original 78 of it in my

collection. It's one of maybe five

known copies.

ENID

(nearly sincere)

Wow!

SEYMOUR

Do you want to see it? I can run

upstairs and get it...

ENID

Yeah, sure, I guess...

SEYMOUR

(to Joe, he always

says this when he

leaves his table)

Watch my stuff.

JOE

(not looking up)

You still interested in that?

ENID

I thought it wasn't for sale.

JOE

I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it

go...

ENID

It's kind of falling apart.

SEYMOUR

Here it is. It's only about V minus

and has an incipient lam crack, but

plays decent as I recall.

ENID

Wow...

ENID

Oops! I dropped it!

SEYMOUR

NO!!!

ENID

Hey, I was only kidding!

ENID

Jesus, Seymour... are you all right?

ROBERTA

I'm not going to start a discourse

on the subject of "good" art vs.

"bad" art; these judgments are for

each person to make on his own. I

merely want to help each of you find

the best way to look within yourselves

the best key to your particular lock.

Last week I asked you to-try and

create a piece of artwork that

responds to something that you have

strong feelings about.

ROBERTA

And it looks like we have some really

interesting work up here....

ROBERTA

What can you tell, us about your

piece... uh...

(struggles to read

signature)

...Phillip?

PHILLIP

(very stupid and

nervous)

Uh... it's uh... it's about The

Mutilator...

ROBERTA

My goodness!

PHILLIP

It's this really great video game

about a guy who kills people with a

big hammer...

ROBERTA

(trying to make a

joke)

I thought maybe this was supposed to

be your father.

ROBERTA

And what can you tell us about this...

(searches for name)

ENID

Enid. It's sort of like a diary I

guess.

ROBERTA

I think that Phillip and Enid can

help us to see that there are-many

different ways we can express

ourselves.  We can do things like

these cartoons that are amusing as a

sort of light entertainment or we

can do work that is more serious in

scope and feeling and that deals

with issues; emotional, spiritual,

political; of great importance. I

hope that you will each have the

tools to do that type of work by the

end of this class.

(pause, points at

WIRE SCULPTURE)

Who is responsible for this?

MARGARET

I am.

ROBERTA

Talk to us about it...

MARGARET

It's my response to the issue of a

woman's right to choose... it's

something I feel super-strongly about.

ROBERTA

Isn't this a wonderful piece, class?

This definitely falls into that higher

category of art I was speaking of

earlier.

MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1

Hello and welcome to Masterpiece

video. How may I help you this

afternoon, sir?

CUSTOMER

I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2.

MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1

Yessir! Is it a new release, sir?

CUSTOMER

No, it's the classic Italian film.

MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1

Let me look that up on the computer

for you, sir!

(FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER)

Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with

Mickey Rourke. It's in our "Erotic

Dramas" section.

CUSTOMER

No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini

film.

MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1

I'll check that for you sir. How do

you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E-

E-P-E-E...?

REBECCA

How about this one?

ENID

Hey, you have to see my new good

luck charm.

REBECCA

Ew ... when did you get that?

ENID

This morning at Seymour's garage

sale.

REBECCA

God, aren't you tired of Seymour

yet?

REBECCA

How about this?

ENID

Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All

these movies suck.

MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #2

(overly cheerful)

Hello! How are you young ladies this

evening? May I help you find a

particular Masterpiece movie?

ENID

No.

ENID

Let's get out of here, this place

makes me sick.

REBECCA

We have to do something fun tonight

this is my last weekend of freedom

before I start my stupid job.

ENID

I know a party we could go to...

REBECCA

What? Where?!

ENID

It's a surprise.

REBECCA

I don't believe you.

ENID

If I promise you there's really a

party with a lot of guys, do you

promise you'll go?

JEROME

There are some records I will pay

serious money for, provided they're

a sincere V plus. Other than that

I'd prefer to just have them on CD.

STEVEN

CDs will never have the presence of

an original 78.

JEROME

WRR-ONG! A digital transfer adequately

mastered will sound identical to the

original. Do you have a decent

equalizer?

STEVEN

I have a Klipsch 2B3.

JEROME

Obviously the problem! You expect a

ten-band equalizer to impart state

of-the-art sound? Dream a little

dream! etc...

REBECCA

I totally, totally hate you.

ENID

Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.

GERROLD

So what's the story with the two

cheerleaders over here?

JOE

They're Seymour's.

GERROLD

Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!

JOE

Don't worry about it. He's not gettin'

any and neither are you.

GERROLD

(poking Joe in the

chest)

Let me tell ya somethin', Joe...

Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a

home run without swinging the bat!

JOE

Right.

GERROLD

Mind if I sit here?

REBECCA

(staring straight

ahead)

Yes.

GERROLD

Whoa, that was cold! Hey, you're

okay, you're pretty sharp. So uh...

hey, you're wearing a green dress -

whadda you Irish? I bet you're Irish.

What's your name?

REBECCA

Melorra...

GERROLD

Melorra, listen to me - let me tell

you something Melorra... you seem

like an interesting chick - what are

you doing hanging out with these

losers here? Whaddya say you and me

take off and hit some nightspots

etc. etc.

ENID

I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get

a beer.

REBECCA

(to ENID)

Wait...

SEYMOUR

...but it plays like new. There's no

groove wear.

PAUL

Oh please... It has an enlarged center

hole and a hair crack.

SEYMOUR

But the crack is so tight it's

completely inaudible.

PAUL

A tight hair crack is just that - a

crack. I don't collect cracked

records.

(walking away)

I only pay a premium for mint records

Seymour, you know that!  Please!

ENID

What was all that stuff about enlarged

holes and tight cracks?

SEYMOUR

I... I didn't think you would have

any interest in this get together...

I mean if you had told me you were

coming I would have warned you --

it's not like a real party or

anything.

ENID

You're right about that.

(pause)

So this is your record collection?

SEYMOUR

Oh God no. This is just junk I have

for sale or trade. The record room

is off-limits.

ENID

Really? Can I see it?

SEYMOUR

Yeah, well sure... you can if you

want to... it's just I don't want

all these guys in there at once...

you know...

ENID

Wow! This is like my dream room!

Are these all records!

SEYMOUR

I have about fifteen hundred 78s at

this point. I've tried to pare down

my collection to the essential...

ENID

God, look at this poster!  I can't

believe this room! You're the luckiest

guy in the world! I'd kill to have

stuff like this!

SEYMOUR

Please... go ahead and kill me!

This stuff doesn't make you happy,

believe me.

ENID

Oh, come on! What are you talking

about?

SEYMOUR

You think it's healthy to obsessively

collect things? You can't connect

with other people so you fill your

life with stuff...  I'm just like

all the rest of these pathetic

collector losers.

ENID

No you're not! You're a cool guy,

Seymour.

SEYMOUR

Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why

haven't I had a girlfriend in four

years? I can't even remember the

last time a girl talked to me.

ENID

I'm talking to you... I'll bet there

are tons of women who would go out

with you in a minute!

SEYMOUR

Oh, right...

ENID

No really... I guarantee I could get

you a date in like two seconds...

SEYMOUR

Good luck...

ENID

I'm totally serious!

SEYMOUR

Yeah, well...

ENID

I mean it -- You leave everything to

me -- I'm going to be your own

personal dating service!

SEYMOUR

I appreciate the offer but you really

don't --

ENID

Mark my words, by the end of this

summer you'll be up to your neck in

pussy!

SEYMOUR

Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid

but I - I really --

ENID

What about her? Would you go out

with her?

SEYMOUR

I don't know, what kind of question

is that? I mean it's totally

irrelevant because a girl like that

would never be caught dead with me...

ENID

But putting that aside for now, would

you go out with her?

SEYMOUR

I really didn't get a good look at

her.

ENID

Okay, what about this one? Are you

into girls with big tits?

SEYMOUR

(embarrassed)

Jesus!

ENID

C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect

data here! Don't you want me to find

you your perfect dream girl?

SEYMOUR

I'm just not one of those guys who

has a "type"...

ENID

Every guy has a type!

SEYMOUR

(he doesn't really

mean this)

I mean as long as she's not a complete

imbecile and she's even remotely

attractive...

ENID

Hey look, there's Norman!

ENID

Hi Norman.

ENID

We need to narrow this down somehow...

we need to find a place where you

can meet women who share your

interests.

SEYMOUR

Maybe I don't want to meet someone

who shares my interests.  I hate my

interests! Where can I go to meet

the exact opposite of myself?

ENID

Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your

five main interests, in order of

importance.

SEYMOUR

(sighs)

Well, let's see... I guess I'd have

to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and

Ragtime music at the top of the list,

then probably...

ENID

Let's just say "music" - that way

you only use up one...

(spots The Sidewinder)

Wait, we have to go in here for a

second...

ENID

Hi Josh.

JOSH

(without turning around)

Hi.

ENID

I just stopped in to say hi.

JOSH

Yeah, well... hi...

ENID

This is my friend Seymour.

ENID

See you later, Josh!

BOSS

JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

SEYMOUR

(pause)

So is that your boyfriend?

ENID

Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend...

He's just this guy that Becky and I

like to torture.

SEYMOUR

Well are --

ENID

(interrupts suddenly)

Oh my god! We have to go in here!

SEYMOUR

Yeah, sure... very funny....

ENID

Please, Seymour... Becky and I have

been dying to go in here but we can't

get any boys to take us...  Please?

SEYMOUR

I - I'd really rather not...

ENID

We'll just go in for one minute --

it'll be a riot!

SEYMOUR

I don't think so...

ENID

PLEASE? We have to!

SEYMOUR

I really don't think it's a good

idea.

ENID

Fine, I'll go by myself then...

ENID

(whispering)

Wow! Look at all these creeps!

SEYMOUR

Shh!

ENID

OH MY GOD!

ENID

What kind of weirdo would actually

have sex with this? We have to buy

this!

ENID

God, this place is a total riot!

ENID

Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" -

isn't child pornography totally

illegal?

SEYMOUR

These are older women just dressed

up to look young... I think.

ENID (V.O.)

Oh my god!

ENID

How much are these boots? Do you

have these in size five?

CASHIER

That's the only pair of those I have

right now. I'm getting a new order

in next week...

ENID

OH MY GOD SEYMOUR! You have to lend

me the money to buy this.

SEYMOUR

Uh, I don't have much money with me

right now.

ENID

C'mon, Seymour, please?

CASHIER

Why don't you come back in two weeks -

we'll be having our annual Back-to-

School sale.

YUPPIE #1

I'd like a medium latte for here.

REBECCA

Can I get you a biscotti to go with

that?

YUPPIE #1

NO! Just the latte.

ENID (V.O.)

Give me all your money, bitch!

REBECCA

Where did you get that?

ENID

You won't believe it! Guess!

REBECCA

Where?

ENID

Anthony's II!

REBECCA

No way... when?

ENID

Just now... I went with Seymour.

REBECCA

You cunt!

FELDMAN

Excuse me - I can't read the trivia

question!

ENID

"Where on the human body is the

'Douglas Pouch' located?"

FELDMAN

Slightly below the uterus on a female.

ENID

That guy is totally amazing.

REBECCA

He does that every single day.

YUPPIE #2

Can I get a decaf mocha to go?

REBECCA

Can I get you a...

YUPPIE #2

NO, I don't want a biscotti with

that.

ENID

God, how can you stand all these

assholes?

REBECCA

I don't know... Some people are okay,

but mostly I feel like poisoning

everybody.

ENID

At least the wheelchair guy is sort

of entertaining...

REBECCA

He's a total asshole... He doesn't

even need that wheelchair, he's just

totally lazy!

ENID

That rules!

REBECCA

No, it doesn't. You'll see... you

get totally sick of all the creeps

and losers and weirdos.

ENID

But those are our people...

REBECCA

Yeah, well...

(pause)

So when are you going to get your

job?

ENID

I'm working on it... I've got a few

leads... it's just that right now I

have, all these projects that take

up all my time.

REBECCA

Like what?

ENID

Nothing. Don't worry... I promise

I'll get a job next week.

REBECCA

(pause)

God, I can't believe you went to

Anthony's without me.

TV COMMERCIAL (V.O.)

(sincere)

Hope comes in all forms. To the

endangered white stork searching for

wetlands it comes in the form of a

sanctuary provided by people who

care. Do people care? Chevron does.

That's why at Chevron we're just as

concerned...

DAD

Are you still looking for a job? Do

you have any leads?

ENID

Will you get off my back for once?

DAD

It's tough to find a good job without

any kind of training.

ENID

Look, I told you I'm not going to

college.

DAD

Well, I think it's good to keep all

your options open. You can always

enroll for the winter quarter.  You

could even live here and go to the

city college part time, and still

get a job if you wanted to.

ENID

Look at me -- I'm not even listening

to a word you're saying.

DAD

Did I tell you who I ran into at the

bagel place?

ENID

(reading cereal box)

Who?

DAD

Guess.

ENID

How should I know?

DAD

Someone from the past.

ENID

Who?

DAD

Give up?

ENID

YES.

DAD

Maxine.

ENID

Not the Maxine?

DAD

Yup.

ENID

God, how horrifying.

REBECCA

...you don't have to make a million

dollars -- just get any stupid job

so we can at least start looking for

an apartment.

ENID

(thoughtful pause)

I wonder if I hang around with you

because you're like my surrogate

mother figure or something. Like I

have this subconscious biological

need to be nagged and bitched at

constantly.

REBECCA

You hang out with me because nobody

else can stand to be around you.

ENID

Or maybe... did you ever think that

deep down we really might be lesbos?

Maybe that's why we spend so much

time together.

REBECCA

You're gross.

(pause)

See that guy?

ENID

Which one?

REBECCA

He gives me a total boner!

ENID

He's like the biggest idiot of all

time!

COLLEGE SOPHOMORE

Are you guys up for some reggae

tonight?

REBECCA

Okay, you're right.

ENID

(whispers)

Heads up.

GUY

Hey, my band is playing here on Friday

night and uh... there's gonna be a

bunch of cool bands playing and stuff

and you don't have to pay if you

show this flyer at the door... you

should come check it out.

REBECCA

(shyly)

Thanks...

(she looks away)

ENID

Which one is your band?

GUY

Alien Autopsy.

ENID

(sarcastic)

Bitchin'.

GUY

(embarrassing pause;

then, to Rebecca)

Yeah, well... maybe I'll see you

there...

(pause; walks away)

ENID

What a dork!

REBECCA

You're just jealous.

ENID

Yeah, right... Believe me, at this

point I'm over the fact that every

single guy likes you better than me!

REBECCA

Face it, you hate every single boy

on the face of the earth!

ENID

That's not true, I just hate all

these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo-

bohemian losers!

(sad pause)

Sometimes I think I act so weird

because I'm crazy from sexual

frustration.

REBECCA

Haven't you heard about the miracle

of masturbation?

ENID

(sighs)

...maybe we should be lesbos...

REBECCA

Get away from me!

DISSOLVE TO:

ROBERTA

Who is this, Enid?

ENID

It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

ROBERTA

And what was your reason for choosing

him as your subject?

ENID

I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.

ROBERTA

I see... interesting...

ROBERTA

What do we have here, Margaret?

MARGARET

It's a tampon in a teacup...

ROBERTA

I can see that... now what can you

tell us about it? First of all, what

kind of sculpture is this?

MARGARET

It's a "found object"... that's when

an artist takes an ordinary object

and places it in an artistic context

and thus it becomes art.

ROBERTA

Very good. Now, what can you tell us

about it in regard to your artistic

intent?

MARGARET

I guess I see the teacup as a symbol

for womanhood, because of tea parties

in the olden days, but instead of

tea I was trying to kind of confront

people with this... like...

ROBERTA

This shocking image of repressed

femininity!

MARGARET

Right, exactly!

ROBERTA

I think it's really a wonderful piece,

Margaret!

ROBERTA

This illustrates perfectly what I

was saying about not being afraid to

use controversial imagery, class...

DISC JOCKEY

KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful

evening.

SEYMOUR

God, that asshole's voice is so

hateful! No wonder I never listen to

the radio!

ENID

(shutting it off)

Relax, Seymour, relax...

SEYMOUR

That thing is just so shrill and

piercing and loud - it's like someone

jabbing me in the face!

(imitating insincere

DJ voice)

KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful

evening...

ENID

So, why did you bring this along?

SEYMOUR

I brought it for him to autograph.

He's going to be amazed to see it -

it's one of two known copies... I

can't believe they have him for the

opening act and not the headliner.

What an insult!

ENID

This bar's going to be packed with

girls for you to pick from.

SEYMOUR

I'm not holding my breath in that

department.

SEYMOUR

What are we, in slow motion here?!

What are ya, hypnotized? Have some

more kids, why don't you?... For

Christ's sake, would you move!?

ENID

Jesus, Seymour.

SEYMOUR

I can't believe these people! They

could at least turn off their stupid

sports game until he's done playing!

M.C.

Let's hear it for Fred Chatman.

(a little more APPLAUSE)

Hey don't go away because we've got

Blueshammer coming up in just a

minute!

SEYMOUR

Yes, that would certainly do...

ENID

Well, offer her a seat! You want me

to do it?

SEYMOUR

Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I

gotta think of something to talk to

her about. No! No...

ENID

Just wait here.

CUTE GIRL

Hi.

SEYMOUR

Hello. Uh... that was great music,

huh?

CUTE GIRL

(sitting down)

Yeah, I just love blues.

SEYMOUR

Actually, technically what he was

mostly playing would more accurately

be classified in the "ragtime" idiom.

Although of course not in the

strictest sense of the more classical

ragtime piano music like that of

Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic

Blues has a more conventional twelve-

bar structure in its stanzas.

CUTE GIRL

Oh if you like authentic blues, you've

just gotta see Blueshammer!  They're

so great!

LANCE

(LEAD SINGER)

All right people! Are you ready to

BOOGIE? Cuz we gwine play you some

authentic, way-down-in-the-delta

blues to rock your world! One, Two,

Three...

SEYMOUR

What did you tell that girl?

ENID

I told her you were a big record

executive and you were thinking of

signing that band to your label.

SEYMOUR

Jesus...

SEYMOUR

Now I remember why I haven't gone

anywhere in months. I'm not even in

the same universe as those creatures

back there. I might as well be from

another planet.

ENID

We just need to figure out a place

where you can meet somebody who isn't

a total idiot, that's all.

SEYMOUR

Look, I really appreciate your help,

Enid, but let's face it, this is

hopeless.

ENID

It's not hopeless...

SEYMOUR

Yeah, well it's simple for everybody

else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair

of Nikes and they're happy! I just

can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.

ENID

Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity

either, but I don't think it's totally

hopeless...

SEYMOUR

But it's not totally hopeless for

you... I've had it. I don't even

have the energy to try anymore.  You

should make sure you do the exact

opposite of everything I do so you

don't end up like me...

ENID

I'd rather end up like you than those

people at that stupid bar...  At

least you're an interesting person...

at least you're not exactly like

everybody else...

SEYMOUR

Hooray for me.

SEYMOUR

I'm not sure I have anything to

drink... there might be some --

ENID

It doesn't matter, I'm not staying

long... I just want to make sure I

convince you not to give up yet.

SEYMOUR

"Yet."

ENID

(picks up an antique

knick knack)

Wow, this is so cool...

SEYMOUR

If you don't mind my asking -- why

do you care so much if I get a date

or not?

ENID

I dunno... because I can't stand the

idea of a world where a guy like you

can't get a date...

ENID

What the fuck, Seymour?! What is

this?

SEYMOUR

What?... Oh that... I borrowed that

from work about fifteen years ago...

I guess it's mine now.

ENID

What, are you a klansman or something?

SEYMOUR

Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks

a lot!... Do you know the Cook's

Chicken franchise?

ENID

(quoting TV commercial

in deep voice)

"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried

with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

SEYMOUR

Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made

up name. When they originally opened

back in 1922 they were named "The

Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early

painting of their first logo.

SEYMOUR

I'm obsessed with all this stuff -

this lost culture of the 20th century.

ENID

Why doesn't everybody know this?

SEYMOUR

(somewhat bitterly)

It's ancient history. The same reason

nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco

record.

SEYMOUR

Actually, I was a whole lot more

interested in the Cook's phenomenon

when I was about your age. I've kind

of lost interest since I've been

working for them...

ENID

You work at Cook's Chicken?

SEYMOUR

For nineteen years...

ENID

What are you, a fry cook or something?

SEYMOUR

Nothing so glamorous... actually,

I'm an assistant manager at their

corporate headquarters.

ENID

Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work

in an office all day.

SEYMOUR

Hey, I get good benefits, a good

early retirement plan, nobody ever

bothers me...

ENID

Yeah, but still...

SEYMOUR

I make enough money to eat and buy

old records... what more do I want?

ENID

So, I don't really get it -- are you

saying that things were better back

then

(points at painting)

even though there was stuff like

this?

SEYMOUR

No, in a lot of ways things are better

now... I dunno... it's complicated.

Everybody still hates each other,

but they know how to hide it better,

or something...

ENID

(suddenly)

Hey, can I borrow this?

SEYMOUR

What? Why?

ENID

I promise I'll take good care of it.

SEYMOUR

I dunno... they're very sensitive at

work about all this stuff. Maybe it

would be better if you --

ENID

Don't you trust me, Seymour?

ROBERTA

Let's address some discussion to

this piece.

SNOTTY GIRL

I don't like it.

ROBERTA

Can you tell us why?

SNOTTY GIRL

I don't know.

HIPPY-ISH BOY

I think it's totally weak.

BLACK GIRL

Yeah, it's not right.

ROBERTA

These are all valid comments, but I

think we should see if the artist

has anything to bring to this.

ENID

Well, I got the idea when I was doing

some research and I discovered that

Cook's Chicken used to be called

Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to

do my project based on this discovery

as kind of a comment on racism...

and the way racism is whitewashed

over in our culture...

ROBERTA

Did you actually do this painting?

ENID

Well, no - it's more like a "found

art object."

ROBERTA

And how do you think this addresses

the subject of racism?

ENID

It's complicated... I guess I'm trying

to show how racism used to -- more

out in the open and now it's hidden,

or something...

ROBERTA

And how does an image like this help

us to see that?

ENID

I'm not sure... I mean...

(thinks)

I guess because when we see something

like this it seems really shocking

and we have to figure out why it's

so shocking?

ROBERTA

I don't really know what to say,

Enid...

(another over-long

pause)

...It's a remarkable achievement.

REBECCA

Are you kidding? It's a dream job!

I can't believe you got a job like

that without even trying... God, I

wish that was my job...

ENID

(trying to generate

some enthusiasm)

Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least

I'll get to see every movie for free,

I guess... I had to lie and tell

them I already graduated...

REBECCA

When are you finally going to get

your diploma?

ENID

I dunno, but next week is my last

class...

REBECCA

Anyway, now we can start looking for

the apartment...

(waits for some

response from Enid,

but there is none)

Do you remember when we first came

up with that whole idea of renting

our own apartment?

ENID

Wasn't it like eighth grade?

REBECCA

Seventh... you wanted to move out

right then!

ENID

That must have been when my dad was

married to Maxine...

REBECCA

I remember our big plan was as soon

as we got the apartment we were going

to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming

over and then fuck him.

ENID

We were such desperate sluts back

then.

MANAGER

I'm gonna let you handle the four

thirty crowd by yourself - that way

I can evaluate your performance while

it's slow and ease you into the bigger

crowds.

ENID

You can count on me, sir!

LOSER

Do you serve beer or any alcohol?

ENID

I wish!... actually you wish... after

about five minutes of this movie

you'll wish to God you had about ten

beers!

MANAGER

(pulling her aside)

What are you doing? You don't ever

criticize the feature!

ENID

Why? What difference does it make?

You already got his money...

MANAGER

Look, that's the policy... if you

want to make up your own rules you

can open your own theater...

ENID

But I was only trying to be

friendly...

MANAGER

Look, we don't pay you to be a movie

critic -- just do your job.

ENID

Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

CUSTOMER

Medium popcorn.

ENID

That's three dollars.

CUSTOMER

Let me have plenty of butter on that.

ENID

Ewww!...

(making a face)

Here you go -- smothered in delicious

yellow-chemical sludge!

MANAGER

(pulling her aside)

What the hell is wrong with you?!

ENID

What? I'm just kidding around with

the customers... It's my shtick!

MANAGER

Well lose it! And why aren't you

pushing the large sizes? Didn't you

get training about upsizing?

ENID

But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

MANAGER

It's not optional!

ENID

Jesus...

CUSTOMER #2

Can I get a medium sprite?

ENID

A medium sprite? Why sir, do you not

know that for a mere twenty five

cents more you could purchase a large

beverage that has a volume of over

twice that of a puny medium drink?

(she gives MANAGER a

look)

...I'm only telling you this because

we're such good friends -- Medium is

strictly for suckers who don't

understand the concept of value!

REBECCA

What are you talking about? What

kind of loser gets fired after one

day?!

ENID

I told you - my manager was a total

asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to

get another job... and anyway, I

have some ideas for how to make money

in the meantime...

CUSTOMER

I'm not at all happy with this latte

what do you intend to do about it?

REBECCA

This is it? I can't believe you're

selling some of this stuff.

ENID

Fuck it. Everything must go!

REBECCA

Oh my god, I remember this hat...

this was during your little old lady

phase...

HIPSTER

How much is this?

ENID

That's not for sale.

HIPSTER

(noticing price tag)

Wait, it says five dollars...

ENID

Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided

not to sell it...

REBECCA

What was that all about? I thought

everything must go!

ENID

Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let

some asshole with a goatee own Goofy

Gus.

GIRL

How much is this dress?

REBECCA

Oh my god, you're selling that?

ENID

(long pause)

That's five hundred dollars.

GIRL

What?

ENID

Five hundred.

GIRL

You're crazy -- it should be like

two dollars!

ENID

I was wearing that dress the day I

lost my virginity.

GIRL

Well why do I care about that?

ENID

Why do you even want it? It would

look stupid on you.

GIRL

God, fuck you!

ENID

Put that stuff back, it's not for

sale.

BOY

What is this? Some fuckin' joke?

ENID

Yes! Go away!

REBECCA

Now are you going to get a regular

job?

ENID

(defeated, quiet)

Don't worry.

REBECCA

If it makes you feel any better, I

don't think you could've gotten more

than ten bucks for all this stuff.

ENID

Yeah, thanks.

REBECCA

Do you want to do something tonight?

ENID

I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...

(suddenly)

Shit! What time is it?  I have to go

to the store! I was going to make

him a cake...

REBECCA

(miffed, sighs)

Well, are we still going shopping

tomorrow?

ENID

Yeah, I guess... call me...

REBECCA

Since when can you make a cake?

ENID

You can open your eyes now.

SEYMOUR

Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I

really appreciate it...

ENID

No, Doofus... blow it out!

SEYMOUR

Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...

ENID

Are you okay?

SEYMOUR

It's just my stupid back. I'll be

all right in a minute...

ENID

What is that?

SEYMOUR

Oh... uh... It's just this elastic

thing I have to wear for lumbar

support...

ENID

What, like a girdle?

SEYMOUR

Maybe now you understand why I can't

get a date.

ENID

Yeah, well, you're not the only one.

Everybody I know has totally fucked

up problems... It seems like only

stupid people have good

relationships...

SEYMOUR

(sarcastically cheering

her on)

That's the spirit!

ENID

I mean, I'm eighteen years old and

I've never even had a real, steady

boyfriend for more than like two

weeks!

SEYMOUR

Really?

ENID

Never...

SEYMOUR

I'm starting to think that even if I

did get a girlfriend it really

wouldn't change anything.

ENID

I know. It's not like it makes all

your problems go away.

SEYMOUR

Then again, that's easy for me to

say, since I'll never even get a

date. I'm sure you have hundreds of

guys who are interested in you.

ENID

Actually, I've got a total crush on

this one guy right now, but it's a

really fucked-up situation...

SEYMOUR

Oh yeah?

ENID

Oh wait, you met him... remember

that guy Josh? I'm like practically

obsessed with him, but I can't do

anything about it because Becky would

freak out.

SEYMOUR

Why?

ENID

Never mind, it's way too

complicated...

(pause)

Did you have problems like this when

you were my age - where you're totally

confused all the time?

SEYMOUR

I won't even dignify that with a

response.

ENID

(looking at his records)

I wonder if you really like all these

old records or if you only like the

fact that nobody else likes them?

SEYMOUR

(a sore subject)

Who knows?

ENID

Aren't you going to get that?

SEYMOUR

Let the machine get it. I have no

desire to talk to anyone who would

be calling me...

SEYMOUR

I knew it... it's my mother.

VOICE ON MACHINE

Uh... HI!  Uh... I'm calling for...

um... you placed an ad in the Weekly

over a month ago and... well, I'm

the redhead in the yellow dress...

at least I think I am... I saw the

ad when you first placed it but I

was in this relationship at the time

so I cut it out, and now I'm not in

the relationship anymore...

(giggles)

God, this is really confusing...

anyway, if you still want to talk to

me I can be reached at KL5-2603,

that's my work number and my name is

Dana... um... BYE!

ENID

Wow!

(feigning ignorance)

What was that all about?

SEYMOUR

It's just somebody's idea of a joke...

ENID

That didn't sound like a joke to

me... what, did you write a personal

ad or something?

SEYMOUR

(still confused)

Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called

before once... it's just somebody

trying to humiliate me.

ENID

Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a

joke -- you have to call her back!

SEYMOUR

How can you be so sure?

ENID

Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff

like this -- she was totally for

real!

DAD (O.S.)

Pumpkin? Could you come in here for

a minute?

DAD

Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine?

MAXINE

Hi, Enid.

ENID

Hi.

(to Dad)

Look, I'm kind of tired - I think

I'll go to bed.

DAD

I made spaghetti. Do you want some?

ENID

I-I really have to get up early for

class tomorrow.

MAXINE

It's really quite something to see

you all grown up like this, Enid.

(no response from

Enid)

I'd love to hear about what you're

doing. I can't help but feel that I

had some small part in how you turned

out...

(another silent pause)

What are you studying? You were always

such a smart little girl.

ENID

I'm taking a remedial high school

art class for fuck-ups and retards.

ROBERTA

Smile, Enid...

ROBERTA

I'm going to miss you people... I

feel that we've all done a lot of

growing this summer. I hope that

each of you feels as though you'll

be taking away something from this

experience; I know I certainly will

be...

ROBERTA

Remember, the art show is this

Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try

to get there at least 15 minutes

early.

ROBERTA

Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?

ENID

Uh-oh.

ROBERTA

Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I

was just wondering what your plans

were for next year?

ENID

I'm not really sure - working, I

guess...

ROBERTA

Well, I know this is really short

notice, but I got a call from a very

close friend at the Academy of Art &

Design and she tells me that I'm

allowed to place one student from

your graduating class in a one year

scholarship program... and, well, I

hope you don't mind, Enid, but I

took the liberty of submitting your

name.

ENID

Hmm.

ROBERTA

As far as I know it includes housing

and meals and everything... it is

really quite an offer...

ENID

...wow...

ROBERTA

(pause)

So what do you think?

ENID

I dunno... Would I have to take

classes and stuff?

ROBERTA

Well, yes...

ENID

I...

ROBERTA

Let me know as soon as you can, Enid.

This could be a great thing for you.

ENID

I think one of us should fuck Josh...

REBECCA

Go ahead...

ENID

No, really...

REBECCA

God, you're really obsessed...

ENID

I am not -- I just think it'd be

funny to see what he'd do...

REBECCA

I thought we decided that Josh was

way too cool to be interested in

sex, and that he's the only decent

person left in the world and we would

never want to bring him down to our

level and all that...

ENID

Yeah, but maybe one of us should at

least try...

REBECCA

No matter what happened it would be

a big disaster... Let's just try and

keep everything the way it is.

REBECCA

Look, we have to get these...

ENID

I can't afford stuff like this right

now.

REBECCA

I'm sick of waiting - we need to

start getting stuff if we're ever

going to move.

(pause, sees towels)

Aren't these the greatest towels?

ENID

Why do you care about this kind of

stuff?

REBECCA

Don't you want nice stuff?

ENID

I can't imagine spending money on

towels.

REBECCA

You don't have to. I'll pay for all

the stuff right now and you can pay

me back when you finally get a job.

ENID

You're insane.

REBECCA

Do you still want to go to that thing

tonight?

ENID

What thing?

REBECCA

That guy's band is playing tonight...

Alien Autopsy.

ENID

Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going

on his big date tonight and I kind

of want to be around when he calls,

so I can hear how bad it went.

REBECCA

God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

SEYMOUR

That was great - jeez, thanks again

for cooking all this.

DANA

Oh I love to cook. I guess most women

wouldn't invite a man over on the

first date, but I believe you should

trust your instincts. When I talked

to you on the phone you just seemed

so... I don't know... harmless. Ready

for ice cream?

DANA

Here we are... it's mocha mint from

Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that

photograph just heart-rending?

SEYMOUR

Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?

DANA

Was it Bosnia? I forget...

(pause)

It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire

country eloquently captured in the

face of one little boy.

(pause)

A Soul/Funk song starts up on the

radio that catches her attention.

She goes over and turns it up.

DANA

Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it

great? Doesn't it make you want to

dance? C'mon!

SEYMOUR

Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance,

heh, heh...

DANA

Don't be silly, anyone can dance.

Here, just follow me... watch my

feet.

SEYMOUR

No, really I --

DANA

C'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind.

Just loosen up and feel the music!

Here, put down your bowl of ice cream.

SEYMOUR

(checking his watch)

Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're

gonna have to leave now if we're

going to make that movie.

DANA

Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just

let me put a few things away.

DANA

I'm so excited to see this film -

Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant

director! Did you see his last film,

The Flower That Drank The Moon? It

was simply glorious!

SEYMOUR

Uh, no. I missed that one. But what

do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy

movies.

DANA

Really? I never really cared for

those. Why does the fat one always

have to be so mean to the skinny

one?

SEYMOUR

Uh... hello?

ENID

Hi, it's me...

SEYMOUR

Oh, hi...

ENID

So, what happened?

SEYMOUR

(almost whispering)

Actually, it's kind of still

happening... she's over here right

now... I think everything's going

pretty well...

ENID

What? You're kidding me...

SEYMOUR

Yeah, so I better go -- it's not

really the best time to talk...

ENID

What, are you going to like have sex

with her on your first date?

SEYMOUR

Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you

later... bye!

REBECCA

Hello?

ENID

Do you still want to do something

tonight?

REBECCA

What happened to Seymour?

ENID

(still shocked by

this)

I can't believe it - he actually

scored!

REBECCA

How repulsive!

ENID

So should I come over?

REBECCA

Actually, I'm just about to go out

with some friends...

ENID

What are you talking about? Who?

REBECCA

Just some people from work...

ENID

I don't believe you.

REBECCA

Yeah well, you said you were busy...

look, I'd better get going... I'll

call you tomorrow.

JOSH

Hi... what's up?

ENID

Can I come in?

JOSH

Are you the one who left that note?

ENID

I guess.

JOSH

So what's up?

ENID

I don't know... I'm totally

confused...

ENID

Sit over here.

JOSH

Do you want something to drink?

ENID

Why?

JOSH

What do you mean "why"?

ENID

Are you trying to get me wasted so

you can take advantage of my womanly

charms?

JOSH

Yeah, right...

ENID

"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's

so wrong with me?

JOSH

Nothing.

ENID

Then why do you hate me so much?

JOSH

When did I say I hated you?

ENID

You've never once said anything even

remotely nice to me.

JOSH

You make me nervous! I always feel

like you're going out of your way to

make me feel uncomfortable so you

can laugh at me!

ENID

That's just the way I am!

JOSH

Yeah, well --

ENID

It's just my stupid way of getting

attention! God, I practically love

you, Josh!

ENID

Do you have any protection?

JOSH

(now he's romantic

and sappy)

You must have known all along how I --

you know -- how I felt about you --

it must be totally obvious...  God...

I always used to dream about this...

ENID

(staring ahead)

Why do you have that stupid poster?

JOSH

(waking up, groggy,

happily surprised)

Oh, hi...

ENID

Why do all guys have to play stupid

guitars? It's so typical... Either

they're into cars or guns or sports

or guitars... it's so obvious...

JOSH

How long have you been up?

ENID

I couldn't sleep... I should get

going; I feel really weird...

JOSH

Do you want to go get breakfast

somewhere?

ENID

I don't think we should... Look, you

have to totally promise me you won't

tell Becky about this.

JOSH

Why not?

ENID

Because if you do, I'll kill you!

JOSH

Okay... I promise.

ENID

Just take my word for it... if she

ever finds out about this I'll never

hear the end of it...

REBECCA

Goddammit, bitch -- where are you?

ENID

Boo!

SEYMOUR

(very startled)

YAAA!

ENID

Where have you been? I've been looking

all over for you... I've been

wandering the streets day and night

trying to find you...

SEYMOUR

Really?

ENID

No, actually Joe told me you were

here... so how come you never call

me anymore?

SEYMOUR

I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been

really busy...

ENID

Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going

with what's-her-name? Dana?

SEYMOUR

(he looks nervously

at his watch)

Oh... pretty well, surprisingly...

you know...

ENID

So, what kind of stuff do you guys

do together? Is she into old records

and stuff?

SEYMOUR

Sort of... she doesn't dislike any

of that stuff... she's trying,

anyway... actually, we're supposed

to go antique shopping for her

apartment this afternoon...

ENID

(not convinced)

Sounds good...

SEYMOUR

We really should get together sometime

soon... I-I'll definitely call you

this week --

ENID

What, are you trying to get rid of

me?

SEYMOUR

No... no, it's just that I should

get going in a few minutes, and --

ENID

Aren't you even going to ask me how

I'm doing?

SEYMOUR

I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --

ENID

I dunno... okay, I guess...

(pause)

I fucked that guy Josh finally...

SEYMOUR

...so... is he your boyfriend now?

ENID

Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be,

of course. I'm weighing several offers

at the present time...

DANA

Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess

I'm a little early...

SEYMOUR

Dana! Hi!

(pause as the gears

whirl)

Uh, Dana... this is Enid...

DANA

Hello...

ENID

It's great to finally meet you!

DANA

(looking back and

forth between Enid

and Seymour)

How do you two know each other?

ENID

I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me

we're old friends.

DANA

Really?

ENID

Yes, we're very close... In fact, I

was standing right next to Seymour

the first time you called. If not

for me, he would have never called

you back!

DANA

Is that right?

ENID

(phony)

Oops! Look at the time!  I've got to

run! I'll stop by to see you some

time, Seymour...

(then to Dana)

It was really great to meet you!

DAD

I have some good news for you,

Pumpkin.

ENID

(sigh)

What is it now?

DAD

Are you still looking for a job?

ENID

I guess.

DAD

Well, Maxine thinks she can get you

a sales job at Computer Station.

Normally you have to have references

and at least two years of experience,

but she thinks she can convince them.

ENID

Tell her to forget it - I don't need

her help.

DIRECTOR

I'm afraid you're simply going to

have to take that painting down.

Several of the parents have

complained.

ROBERTA

I will do no such thing.

DIRECTOR

Then you leave me no other choice

than to remove it myself!

ROBERTA

I think we should give the artist a

chance to talk to the parents about

her intentions with this piece...

We should be promoting discussion as

a solution, not censorship.

ROBERTA

Margaret, have you seen Enid?

SEYMOUR

Oh... uh, hi... What's up?

ENID

I'm going to this stupid art show

and I want you to be my date...

There's something I have to show

you...

SEYMOUR

I... I don't know. I don't really

think I should...

ENID

Of course you should. C'mon, I'm

already a million hours late.

SEYMOUR

...I better not...

ENID

(pause)

Well forget the art show... let's do

something else.

SEYMOUR

I... I wish I could, Enid, but I

really can't right now... I -- it's

just that I --

ENID

Well when can we do something?

SEYMOUR

It's just that, well, you know, Dana

just got out of a really bad

relationship and I don't want to

give her the wrong idea... you know...

JOE

(walking by with his

sandwich)

Don't mind me, I'll just be in my

room.

ENID

Where did you get those pants?

SEYMOUR

Oh, uh... they were a present from

Dana.

ENID

And you like them?

SEYMOUR

Well, you know... what do I know

about clothes... I've never been the

most fashionable guy -- it's nice to

have someone do all the work for

me...

ENID

(pause)

So that's it? You don't ever want to

see me again?

SEYMOUR

No, of course I do... It's just that

right now I need to --

ENID

What's her problem anyway?  Did she

actually tell you you couldn't see

me?

SEYMOUR

No, no... not exactly... she just

doesn't understand how I would know

somebody like you...

ENID

What does she mean by that - "somebody

like me"?

SEYMOUR

Just someone so young...

ENID

You must have done something to make

her think you like me.

SEYMOUR

I... I don't think so.

ENID

Does that mean you don't like me?

SEYMOUR

No, of course not.

ENID

(looks him in the eye)

So, do you like me, Seymour?

SEYMOUR

In what way do you mean?

ENID

In whatever way you think I mean.

SEYMOUR

(not sure what to

say; long pause)

I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's

a very jealous person. I just don't

want to screw that up right now...

I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we

can go back to being friends...

ENID

I don't think you understand how I

really feel about you, Seymour.

SEYMOUR

...What do you mean?

ENID

(pause)

Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother

you any more.

ENID

Where are we? This is a weird

neighborhood...

REBECCA

It's a totally normal, average

neighborhood!

ENID

I just mean it's weird to me...

I've never been anywhere near here

in my life.

REBECCA

Josh says this is a really good

neighborhood...

ENID

What? When did you see Josh?!

REBECCA

He came into work.

ENID

Why? What did he say?

REBECCA

Nothing.

ENID

When was this?

REBECCA

I don't know! God, don't act so

jealous I only talked to him for two

minutes.

REBECCA

Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you

see it?

(looks around)

That must be it...

ENID

(without enthusiasm)

Great...

REBECCA

What?! It looks totally normal...

what's wrong with it?

ENID

I said "great"...

REBECCA

Oh yeah, I can tell you really love

it!

ENID

Well, what am I supposed to say? "I

can't wait to live in some depressing

shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!

REBECCA

There's something wrong with every

single place we look at! Why don't

you just come right out and tell me

you don't want to move in with me?!

ENID

Because you'll freak out and act

like a total psycho about it.

REBECCA

You're the psycho! You haven't been

able to deal with anything since

high school ended!

ENID

You're the one who's still living

out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

REBECCA

(as she walks away

giving her the finger)

FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your

dad for the rest of your life!

ENID

God FUCK YOU TOO!

DAD

Pumpkin? What's wrong?

ENID

(her back to him,

doesn't move)

Nothing.

DAD

If there's something wrong I wish

you'd tell me about it...

ENID

It's nothing -- it's just some

hormonal thing... don't worry about

it...

DAD

I've got some important news to tell

you, but it can wait till later if

you're not feeling...

ENID

What?

DAD

(speaking slowly and

methodically)

Well... as you know, Maxine and I

have been seeing a lot of each other,

and we decided it might be a good

idea for all of us if she came back

here to live at the end of the Summer,

just so we can all get to know each

other and to make sure this is what

we want.

ENID

Hi I brought over my application for

the art academy... I hope it's not

too late...

ROBERTA

Just a minute...

ROBERTA

Enid! I'm so sorry about what

happened.

ENID

What do you mean?

ROBERTA

The whole business with the art show

and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --

ENID

Huh?

ROBERTA

Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?

ENID

I didn't check my messages...

ROBERTA

Oh my goodness... well, the whole

thing is just ridiculous, and as

soon as the school board is back in

session next Fall I'm going to do

everything I can to help you.

ENID

Help me what?

ROBERTA

Well they're forcing me to give you

a non-passing grade in the class

because of what happened at the

exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm

sure I'll be able to get you your

diploma in the Fall!

ENID

(pause, overwhelmed)

But... can I still get that

scholarship to the Art Academy?

ROBERTA

I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an

official high school graduate before

I can nominate you.  I had to give

it to someone else...  But I'm sure

next year I can --

EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE

(flustered, to Roberta)

Hey, can you help me out over here?

SEYMOUR

What are you doing here?

ENID

I had to see you.

SEYMOUR

What's up?

ENID

Can you at least let me in?

SEYMOUR

Uh... sure... come in.

ENID

(crying)

Look, I just need somebody to be

nice to me for five minutes and then

I'll leave you alone.

SEYMOUR

What's the matter?

ENID

Do you have anything to drink?

SEYMOUR

Uh... I think there's some root

beer...

ENID

What about this?

SEYMOUR

That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be

saving it for our two-month

anniversary. You better not --

ENID

(as she starts opening)

FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

ENID

You need a bigger place - this is

like a little kid's room.

SEYMOUR

I could never move - I've got too

much stuff.

ENID

Where did you get this?

SEYMOUR

Dana bought it when we went antique

shopping. She said it didn't go with

her stuff, so she gave it to me...

she thought it fit in better with my

"old time thingamajigs."

ENID

Jesus, how can you stand her?

SEYMOUR

God, she's going to kill me... this

bottle is half-empty!

ENID

That's great! "Half-empty" - that's

what I like about you, Seymour, you're

a natural pessimist!

SEYMOUR

If you expect the worst, you're never

disappointed.

ENID

What are you talking about? You're

disappointed every minute of your

life.

SEYMOUR

I'm just being realistic.

ENID

At least you're not like every other

stupid guy in the world - all they

care about are guitars and sports...

they're all such fags!

SEYMOUR

I hate sports.

ENID

How come in all that time I was trying

to get you a date, you never asked

me out?

SEYMOUR

You're a beautiful young girl... I

can't imagine you would ever have

had any interest in me, except as an

amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.

ENID

Yeah, but still... it's kind of

insulting for a girl to be ignored

like that.

SEYMOUR

I mean... of course I... why wouldn't

I want to go out with you?

ENID

I dunno... I always feel like

everybody secretly hates me. I'm

just paranoid I guess. I mean, you

like me don't you? We're good friends,

right?

SEYMOUR

Yeah, sure. Of course.

ENID

(contemplative pause)

...Maybe I should just move in here

with you... I could do all the cooking

and dust your record collection and

stuff until I get a job.

SEYMOUR

What about Joe?

ENID

Oh yeah... and Dana...

(says her name with

whiny, disdainful

voice)

You were a lot more fun before you

met Dana. You've been acting way too

normal lately... you're a bitter,

twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour,

that's why I like you.

SEYMOUR

(more drunk than before)

Yeah, well I like you too...

ENID

You know what my number one fantasy

used to be?

SEYMOUR

(pause)

What?

ENID

I used to think about one day not

telling anybody and just taking off

and going to some random place...

Do you ever think about stuff like

that?

SEYMOUR

I guess I probably used to when I

was your age.

ENID

It would have to be some totally

average day when nobody was expecting

it, and I'd just disappear and they'd

never see me again.

SEYMOUR

Sounds like a healthy way to deal

with your problems.

ENID

You know what we should do? Let's go

get in your car right now and just

take off! We could just drive away

and find some new place and start a

whole new life... fuck everybody!

SEYMOUR

I don't think I'm in any condition

to drive.

ENID

I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in

a blaze of glory!

SEYMOUR

So where would we go?

ENID

Who cares? Let's just go... what's

stopping us?

SEYMOUR

I dunno, I...

ENID

I'm serious! I'm just so sick of

everybody! Why can't I just do

whatever I want?

SEYMOUR

What do you want?

ENID

What do you want?

SEYMOUR

I-I-I...

ENID

What's the matter with you, Seymour?

Don't you like me? Be a man for once

in your life!

ENID

God, Dana's going to kill you!

SEYMOUR

...Do you really want us to drive

away somewhere?

ENID

What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...

SEYMOUR

I will if you want to.

ENID

No... forget it...

SEYMOUR

(embarrassingly sappy)

I-I never expected anything like

this to happen...

ENID

Yeah, well... me neither...

SEYMOUR

You must know I always... did you

really mean all that about moving in

with me?

ENID

I was just thinking out loud...

(doesn't want to hurt

his feelings)

I mean, you've got this whole thing

with Dana -- I'm not going to let

you fuck that up...

SEYMOUR

But, I...

ENID

Shhh... I really need to get some

sleep.

SEYMOUR

Good night...

DANA

(into phone)

It's a thirty-year fixed at five and-

a-half...

DANA

(covering receiver)

Seymour! Hello! What are you doing

here?

SEYMOUR

Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt

finish your phone call.

DANA

We're almost done.

(she continues into

phone)

Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded.

They've already paid the earnest

money... well, let them bring it up

if they notice it at the final walk

through. Right, great, sounds good!

COLLEAGUE

Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well,

I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna

go start the paperwork.

DANA

Hey... so, what brings you down here?

SEYMOUR

I uh... I feel that I need to uh --

there's something I feel I have to

say... I uh, I've never said this to

anyone before -- believe me, I've

stayed in horrible relationships for

years just so I wouldn't have to do

this, but I uh...

DANA

What are you trying to say?

SEYMOUR

It's just that I feel like it's maybe

not a good idea for us to keep going

out.

SEYMOUR

I-I honestly never intended for this

to happen...

DANA

Please tell me it isn't that teenager!

SEYMOUR

Enid and I were just friends. You

know... we feel comfortable around

each other... she really likes my

old records and...

DANA

I can't believe this! I thought at

the very least a guy like you would

never pull this kind of shit on me!

SEYMOUR

Dana, I... um...

DANA

You disgusting pig! You're just an

overgrown baby who can't deal with a

woman your own age. You pathetic

weakling! You make me sick!

MAXINE

May I ask what you're doing?

ENID

Shhh!

MAXINE

I want to know what you think you're

doing, staying out all night and

worrying your father to death!

ENID

Oh yeah, like he even noticed.

MAXINE

Listen, young lady... I know you

don't like me -- I don't really care

whether you do or not -- but I will

not allow you to treat your father

the way you do.

SEYMOUR (V.O.)

I really want to talk to you. I've

been thinking about what you said

about moving in here...

ENID

I can treat him any way I want to -

I'm an adult! Leave me alone!

REBECCA (V.O.)

Hello?

ENID

I need to talk to you.

ENID

I'm sorry about the other day. I

don't know what's wrong with me...

I really do want to move in with

you.

REBECCA

I don't know... I was thinking maybe

I should live alone. I decided to

rent that place we looked at. I'm

moving in next week.

ENID

Please let me come with you. Please

please please...

REBECCA

I don't know - I'm not sure it's a

good idea.

ENID

Of course it's a good idea... it's

our plan.

REBECCA

But how are you gonna pay rent and

everything? You don't even have a

job.

ENID

I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise.

If I don't, you can totally tell me

to fuck off.

DAD

Pumpkin, are you in there?

ENID

Are you going to yell at me?

DAD

About what?

DAD

Yeah, I heard about that.

ENID

I was in a horrible mood - tell her

not to worry, I'll be completely out

of her life in a few days.

DAD

She understands what you're going

through and she really wants to help

you. She says that job at Computer

Station is still available if you

want it.

ENID

I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.

DAD

Actually, I was just checking to see

if you were here - your friend Seymour

is on his way up.

ENID

What do you mean "on his way up"!?

DAD

I just buzzed him in.

ENID

What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm

not here!

DAD

But I can't --

ENID

JUST DO IT!

DAD (V.O.)

I'm not sure when she'll be back...

JOE

Well, here's where the fun never

stops!

SEYMOUR

Yeah, I'm really, really happy.

Really having a good time.

JOE

Still torturing yourself over that

Enid, huh?

SEYMOUR

Where else am I ever going to find

another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley

records?

(pause)

She could at least have the decency

to call me back.

JOE

Maybe she was just using you to try

and get back at some guy. Who knows?

It could be a million things. It's

wasted time trying to logically figure

out the female brain, that's for

sure.

JOE

Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

SEYMOUR

(bummed out, wants

Joe to stop)

Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me

up.

JOE

(deadpan)

No problem.

JOE

Look at it this way - at least things

can't get any worse.

EXECUTIVE

Seymour! Just the man I want to see.

Step in here for a minute.

EXECUTIVE

Have a seat.

EXECUTIVE

What can you tell me about this,

Seymour?

REBECCA

So, whaddya think?

ENID

It's fine.

REBECCA

So where's all your stuff?

ENID

There.

REBECCA

That's all you're bringing?

ENID

I'm gonna finish packing tonight...

I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

REBECCA

What time?

ENID

I dunno...

REBECCA

Make sure you're here by noon - we

have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah!

I have to show you something else!

REBECCA

Isn't this the greatest?

REBECCA

(as she opens the

door)

What's wrong with you, retard - it's

three-thirty!

SEYMOUR

Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother

told me I'd find her here?

REBECCA

She's not at home?

SEYMOUR

No... they said she was here...

REBECCA

What the fuck is she doing?! She was

supposed to be here three hours ago!

SEYMOUR

Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really

need to talk to her.

REBECCA

(allows him to step

inside but leaves

the door open)

Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe

she was just hiding from you.

SEYMOUR

Why would she be hiding from me?

REBECCA

I don't know... where is she, then?

SEYMOUR

Maybe she's with Josh?

REBECCA

Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?

SEYMOUR

I don't know.

REBECCA

Why? What did she tell you?

SEYMOUR

She just mentioned him a few times

and said that they had been dating -

I thought maybe she was...

REBECCA

What? Is she having some secret affair

with Josh?

SEYMOUR

I have no idea - I just want to...

REBECCA

Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no

way! She could never keep that to

herself... you're crazy.

SEYMOUR

Really, I don't know enough about it

to...

REBECCA

That slut!

SEYMOUR

(changing subject

back to me)

Why did you say she might be hiding

from me? Did she say anything to you

about me?

REBECCA

(getting revenge on

Seymour)

Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

SEYMOUR

Did she say that?

REBECCA

Look, what do you expect?  Considering

how we met you.

SEYMOUR

What do you mean?

REBECCA

On that pathetic fake blind date.

SEYMOUR

What are you talking about?

REBECCA

Didn't she ever tell you about that?

God, she really is pathological...

SEYMOUR

What fake blind date? What are you

talking about?

REBECCA

Here. Read it and weep.

SEYMOUR

I hope you had a good laugh at my

expense.

JOSH

Huh... oh... hi... uh...

SEYMOUR

You want to see something funny?

I'll show you something funny!

JOSH

HEY!

BOSS

Josh! What going on here?!

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"

SEYMOUR

I have to admit, things have really

started looking up for me since my

life turned to shit.

THERAPIST

So tell me more about this job.

What exactly will you be doing?

SEYMOUR

Well, mostly archival research,

cataloguing old records and writing

liner notes for their CD reissues.

It's really... I can't believe it.

THERAPIST

Remember what I said when we first

started -- this little breakdown

might turn out to be the best thing

that ever happened to you!

SEYMOUR

It doesn't pay very much, but I should

be able to afford my own place in a

few months... Do you think that's

too soon? I'm really anxious to get

my record collection out of storage...

THERAPIST

Why don't we start with that next

week?

SEYMOUR

Thank you, doctor.

THERAPIST

(as she opens the

door)

Don't thank me. You're doing all the

work.

THERAPIST

Seymour?

SEYMOUR

Yes?

THERAPIST

Do you have a check for me?

MOTHER

Seymour? Are you done? Did you have

a chance to think about what you

might want for dinner while you were

in there?

SEYMOUR

We can talk about it in the car,

Ma...

ENID

Hi.

REBECCA

Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize

you -- I think I need to get glasses;

you're all blurry!

ENID

(nodding toward

muscular HIPSTER)

You're lucky then, you can't see the

veins on that guy's biceps.

REBECCA

Actually, he's a really nice guy.

REBECCA

Do you want anything?

ENID

Maybe an orange juice.

ENID

Hey, look what I got...

REBECCA

Wow... finally.

ENID

It just came yesterday...

JOSH

Hi Enid.

ENID

Hey Josh.

JOSH

Are you ready to go?

REBECCA

(still counting

receipts)

Yeah, just one second...

REBECCA

(to Josh)

Did you remember to pay the phone

bill?

JOSH

Yeah.

REBECCA

(to Enid)

Call me sometime.

ENID

Definitely. We still have to go to

that shoe store sometime.

THE END
