The Sting

T H E   S T I N G

Second Draft Screenplay

by

DAVID S. WARD

THE STING

FADE OUT.

PHONE GIRL

Beat it, Mottola.

PHONE GIRL

8720...Yes, hold on a second.

(calling over to the Supervisor)

Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.

GRANGER

Yeh?

CUT TO:

COMBS

Granger, this is Combs.  Why

haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody

else is in.

GRANGER

We had a few problems with the Law

this morning.  The Mayor promised

the Jaycees to get tough on the

rackets again, so he shut everybody

down for a couple hours to make it

look good.  Nothing serious, it

just put us a little behind for the

day.

COMBS

You been making your payoffs,

haven't ya?

GRANGER

Hell yes.  He does this every year.

There's nothing to worry about.

COMBS

Okay, finish your count and get it

up here as soon as you can.  I

don't wanta be here all night.

GRANGER

Believe me, the Man's gonna be real

happy.  Looks like we cleared over

ten grand this week.

COMBS

(not impressed)

We cleared 22 here.

GRANGER

Well, hell, you got the whole

Chicago south side.  How do ya

expect the eight lousy spots I've

got to compete with that?

COMBS

(reading off a sheet

of paper on his desk)

They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5

is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks

like you're bringing up the rear,

Granger.

GRANGER

I just got the count.  We'll put

the take on the 4:15.

COMBS

We'll be waitin'.

CUT TO:

GRANGER

(snapping)

Mottola.

GRANGER

(handing him a bundle

of bills)

Take this up to the city on the

4:15.  They'll be waitin' for it at

the clearing house.  And don't stop

for no drinks.  You can get a cab

down the street.

THIEF

(shaking his fist at

the stranger)

You fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get

you for this someday, sucker egg.

BLACK MAN

The wallet.  You gotta go after him.

He's got all the money.

STRANGER

Don't worry, we got the wallet.

What happened?  He get ya with the

knife?

BLACK MAN

(trying to move)

Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta

know it's all there!

STRANGER

You just sit tight, old man.  We're

gonna have to get you to a doctor.

(starting to leave)

I'll call a cop.

BLACK MAN

No, no cops!

STRANGER

(a little uneasy)

You wanted by the law or somethin'?

BLACK MAN

Naw, it's okay.

STRANGER

You're crazy carryin' that kinda

money in this neighborhood.  No

wonder you got hit.

BLACK MAN

(trying to get to his feet)

Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I

gotta get goin'.

(his leg gives way

under him)

STRANGER

You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

BLACK MAN

I gotta!  Look, I run some slots

down in West Bend for a mob here.

I got a little behind on my payoffs

so they figure I been holdin' out

on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to

come up with the cash.  I don't get

it there I'm dead.

STRANGER

It don't look good, gramps, it's

ten of now.

BLACK MAN

I got a hundred bucks for you and

your friend if you deliver the

money for me.

STRANGER

(hesitates)

I dunno.  That little mug that got

ya is mad enough at me already --

what if he's out there waitin'

around a corner with some friends.

BLACK MAN

He won't know you're carryin' it.

C'mon, you gotta help me out.

STRANGER

(makes up his mind)

Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call

you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk

into a bunch of knives for ya.

BLACK MAN

(desperate to Mottola)

How bout you?  I'll give you the

whole hundred!

STRANGER

What makes you think you can trust

him?  He didn't do shit.

MOTTOLA

Hey, butt out, chicken liver.  I

gave him back his wallet, didn't I?

(to black man)

How far is this place?

BLACK MAN

1811 Mason.  Put it in Box 3C.  You

won't have no trouble.  There's

five thousand dollars there and

here's a hundred for you.

MOTTOLA

(taking the bundle of

bills from the black

man, plus the $100 bill)

All right.  I'll make your drop for

you, old man.  And don't worry, you

can trust me.

STRANGER

If that punk and his pals decide to

search ya, you'll never fool 'em

carryin' it there.

BLACK MAN

(suddenly afraid again)

What do we do?

STRANGER

You got a bag or somethin?

BLACK MAN

No.

STRANGER

How 'bout a handkerchief?

BLACK MAN

Here.

STRANGER

Let me have the money.

STRANGER

You better stick that other in here

too, if you wanta keep it.

BLACK MAN

(pleading)

Just hurry, will ya.

STRANGER

(demonstrating by

slipping the bundle

down into crotch)

All right.  Carry it down in your

pants here.

(pulling it back out

and tucking it in

Mottola's pants)

Ain't no hard guy in the world

gonna frisk ya there.

MOTTOLA

Thanks.

(to the black man)

So long, partner.  Don't worry,

everything's gonna be all right.

CABBIE

Where to?

MOTTOLA

Which way is Mason?

CABBIE

About 20 blocks south.

MOTTOLA

Okay, go north.  The Joliet

Station -- Fast.

Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.

CABBIE

What's so funny?

MOTTOLA

I just made the world's easiest

five grand.

CUT TO:

BLACK MAN

Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know

he was that loaded?

STRANGER

Hell no, I just cut into him.  I

woulda settled for pawning one of

them shoes.

HOOKER

(singing)

'With plenty of money and you-oo-

oo,

Oh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo-

oo...'

CRYSTAL

(tired)

Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or

somethin'?

HOOKER

Come into a little dough.  You

wanna get outa here tonight?

CRYSTAL

Can't.  I got a 10 o'clock show.  I

need the five bucks.

HOOKER

I'll spend fifty on ya.

JIMMY

(glad to see him)

Hooker!

HOOKER

How ya doin', Jimmy.

JIMMY

(collecting bets and

paying off the winners)

Ain't seen you in months, boy.

Thought maybe you took a fall.

HOOKER

Naw, just a little hard times,

that's all.  It's all over now.

JIMMY

You gonna have a go here?

(pointing to the

betting board)

How 'bout a ten spot on the line

here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good

today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street

down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

HOOKER

(taking out his wallet)

Three grand on the black.

JIMMY

(worried)

You sure you wanna start off that

big?  Bet like that could put a

real dent in us.

HOOKER

I feel lucky tonight.

JIMMY

Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you

just...

HOOKER

Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Sorry, Hooker.

(making an attempt at

levity, in order to explain)

Good thing that ball came up red.

Guy could get in trouble around

here, losin' a bet that big.

HOOKER

Spin it again.

HOOKER

Spin it anyway, Jimmy.

HOOKER

Don't worry, pal.  I knew it was my

night.

CUT TO:

CRYSTAL

(irritated)

Thanks for the evening, Hooker.  I

can still make the 10 o'clock.  If

you wanna spend 50 bucks on me

again, mail it.

HOOKER

(going into his

pocket for more money)

Hey wait a minute.

(he comes up with 30)

Aw, the hell with ya.

CUT TO:

GREER

They found Mottola.  He was drunk

in a dive in Joliet.  Never got on

the train.

COMBS

(aggravated)

I don't wanta hear about his day,

Greer.  What happened to the money?

GREER

He lost it to a coupla con artists

on his way outa the spot.

COMBS

How much?

GREER

Twelve thousand.

COMBS

All right.  Better get on the phone

to New York.  See what the big mick

wants to do about it.

(pause)

I gotta pretty good idea, though.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FLOYD

Doyle, can I see you a minute?

LONNEGAN

(not looking up from

the table)

I'm busy, Floyd.

FLOYD

It's important.  We had a little

trouble in Chicago today.  One of

our runners got hit for 12 grand.

LONNEGAN

(calmly)

Which one?

FLOYD

Mottola.

LONNEGAN

You sure he didn't just pocket it?

FLOYD

No, we checked his story with a

tipster.  He was cleaned by two

grifters on 47th.

LONNEGAN

They workin' for anybody?

FLOYD

I don't know.  Could be.  We're

runnin' that down now.

LONNEGAN

All right, mark Mottola up a little

and put him on a bus.  Nothin'

fancy, just enough to keep him from

coming back.  Get some local people

to take care of the other two.

(impassively)

We gotta discourage this kinda thing.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

Howdy, Louise.

LOUISE

(admiring Hooker in

his suit)

Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a

sharp hunky in them linens.  If you

wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had

class.

COLEMAN

Turn that down, Leroy.

ALVA

Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was

somethin' to see today.

HOOKER

I'll never be as good as that mark,

Alva.

ALVA

Well, we gonna hear all about it

when we get back from church.

Leroy, get your jacket on, boy.

HOOKER

You goin' to church now?

ALVA

They been havin' late bingo down

there.  I'm gonna call on the Lord

for a little cash, while he's still

payin' off.  Luther, you look in on

that child from time to time, will

ya?

EIRIE KID

Hey, Luther told me he was carrying

a wad, but I didn't figure this much.

HOOKER

Which way did he do, Eirie?

EIRIE KID

Straight north.  He was gonna take

it all and run.

HOOKER

(laughs)

The bastard.  He can blow his nose

all the way.

COLEMAN

You're late.  Where you been?

HOOKER

(flopping into a chair)

I had some appointments.

COLEMAN

(not fooled)

How much did ya lose?

HOOKER

(after a pause)

All of it.

COLEMAN

(pissed)

In one goddamn night?  What are ya

sprayin' money around like that for?

You coulda been nailed.

HOOKER

I checked the place out.  There

weren't no dicks in there.

COLEMAN

You're a con man, and you blew it

like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to

be no pimp.

HOOKER

What's eatin' you?  I've blown

money before.

COLEMAN

No class grifter woulda' done it,

that's all.

HOOKER

You think my play is bad?

COLEMAN

I think it's the best...

COLEMAN

...It's the only reason I ain't

quit before now.

HOOKER

(bewildered)

What?

COLEMAN

I'm gettin' too slow for this

racket.  I done the best I'm gonna

do.  You hang on too long, you

start embarrassin' yourself.

HOOKER

What are you talkin' about?  We

just took off the biggest score

we've ever had.  We can do anything

we want now.

COLEMAN

It's nothin' compared to what you

could be makin' on the Big Con.

You're wastin' your time workin'

street marks.

HOOKER

Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run

out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause

we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you

everything.  If you hadn't taught

me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.

COLEMAN

(a little embarrassed)

Aw hell, you sound like some

goddamn sucker.  You know everything

I know.  You got nothin' more to

learn from me.

HOOKER

But you played the Big Con.  You

said it was nothin'.  A game for

flakes and mama's boys.

COLEMAN

And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a

fool if you don't get into it.  A

bigger fool than I was.

(pause, holding up

the money)

I been lookin' for this one all my

life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance

to step out at the top.

HOOKER

(after a long silence)

What the hell you gonna do with

yourself?

COLEMAN

Aw, I got a brother down in K.C.,

runs a freight outlet.  I can go

halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too

exciting, but it's mostly legal.

COLEMAN

Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't

turn ya out if ya weren't ready.

(flipping Hooker a

piece of paper)

I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I

want you to look up.  There ain't a

better insideman alive.  He'll

teach ya everything ya gotta know.

HOOKER

You'll take a cut of what I make,

won't ya?

COLEMAN

I'm out, Johnny.

HOOKER

If that's the way you want it.

COLEMAN

That's the way I want it.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

How do you like that Coleman, huh?

After three years.

EIRIE KID

Aw come on, it was the only thing

to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya

back.

HOOKER

We were partners.  If it weren't

for Luther I'd still be hustlin'

pinball down at Gianelli's.  I

don't need anything more than I got.

HOOKER

You ain't gonna have nothin' if you

don't lay off them games of chance.

There's a depression on ya know.

HOOKER

There's always a depression on.

EIRIE KID

If you saved a little, you wouldn't

have to grift so much.

HOOKER

I like griftin'.

EIRIE KID

You could buy yourself some things.

Clothes, or a nice car...

HOOKER

I don't look any good in clothes

and I don't know how to drive.

What else ya got to sell, Eirie?

EIRIE KID

Forget it.

HOOKER

Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little

slow down at the Bunco Department

tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the

dominoes?

SNYDER

You scored blood money today,

Hooker.  You need a friend.

HOOKER

(knocking Snyder's

hand away)

Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to

roll.

HOOKER

(getting up slowly)

You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been

home with the flu all day.

(rising to a fuller height)

You can stake out my toilet if you

want.

SNYDER

(pulling Hooker out

of the heap and

smashing him against

the wall again)

I'll tell ya what you did, smart

boy.  You tied into a loaded mark

on 47th across from Maxies.  You

and Coleman played the switch for

him and blew him off to a cab on

49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers

runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it

woulda been perfect.

HOOKER

(startled by the information)

You're crazy.  I'm not stupid

enough to play for rackets money.

SNYDER

Not intentionally maybe, but that

don't make no difference to Lonnegan.

He'll swat you like any fly.

HOOKER

I'll square it with the fixer.

SNYDER

Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I

put the finger on ya.

SNYDER

I figure your end of the score was

at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no

matter what it was.

HOOKER

(lying)

My end was only one.

SNYDER

(not taking the fake)

Then you'll have to come up with

another grand somewhere.

HOOKER

All right.

SNYDER

(pocketing the money

and motioning his

partner to put his

gun away)

You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use

dyin' for 2 grand.

EIRIE KID

I thought you blew all your money.

HOOKER

I did.  That stuff I gave him was

counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the

first place he tries to spend it.

EIRIE KID

(standing outside the booth)

What the hell you gonna do when

Snyder rushes his finger right to

Lonnegan?  You're committin'

suicide, kid.

HOOKER

(waiting for the ring)

Aw Christ, it doesn't make no

difference now.  If Snyder knows

about it so does everybody else.

He never gets anything first...Damn,

there's no answer at Luther's.

EIRIE KID

Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever

you do, don't go back to your place

tonight, don't go anyplace you

usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa

town or somethin', but...

CUT TO:

HOOKER

(shaking the body)

C'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta

get up, Luther.

HOOKER (CONT'D)

Goddamn you, Luther, will you get

up?

(pounding on the body)

I'm not waitin' for you, Luther.

I'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up,

you son of a bitch.  Goddamn you,

Luther, goddamn.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HOOKER

(flashing open his

wallet to reveal the

little tin badge and

then closing it again quickly)

Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept...

I'd like to ask you a few questions.

MAN

(flustered)

What for?  I haven't done anything.

HOOKER

We don't doubt that, but there's a

counterfeiting operation passing

bad money in the station.  Have you

made any purchases here today?

MAN

(reluctantly)

Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

HOOKER

Then I'm afraid we'll have to

impound your money until we're sure

that it's all good.  Can I see your

wallet and your ticket, please?

MAN

(handing them over)

But I got a train to make.

HOOKER

(taking out the money

and returning the wallet)

It'll only take 20 minutes or so.

You can pick it up at the window

down the hall.

MAN

But what about all these other

people?

HOOKER

(blowing up)

We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance.

I'm not the only agent in here, ya

know.  We go around advertising

ourselves, how many counterfeiters

do you think we'd catch, huh?

(pointing to his suit)

You think I'm wearin' this rag here

'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody

thinks life's a holiday or somethin'

when you got a badge.

(pouring it on)

I been here since three this

morning, Charlie, and I never knew

there was so much ugliness in

people.  You try to help 'em and

they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya

go and gotten yourself arrested for

passin' false notes.

MAN

I'm sorry, really I am, but my

train leaves in ten minutes.

HOOKER

All right, I'll give ya a break.

(pointing to a hall)

Down that hall there, there's an

unmarked door on the left.  Go on

in there and wait at the window.

I'll take this...

(he holds up the money)

...in the back and run it through

right away.  We'll have you outta

there in a couple minutes.

MAN

Thank you.  You don't know how much

I appreciate this.

HOOKER

(with a little wave)

Think nothin' of it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HOOKER

Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy

named Henry Gondorff.  You know him?

BILLIE

(starting back up the stairs)

No.

HOOKER

Luther Coleman sent me.

BILLIE

(checking him out)

You Hooker?

HOOKER

Yeh.

BILLIE

Why didn't you say so.  I thought

maybe you was a copper or somethin'.

BILLIE

It's the room in the back.  He

wasn't expecting you so soon though.

HOOKER

(to himself)

The great Henry Gondorff.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

HOOKER

You sober?

GONDORFF

I can talk, can't I?

GONDORFF

Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a

real horse's ass.

HOOKER

Yeh, Luther said you could teach me

something.  I already know how to

drink.

GONDORFF

(quietly)

I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the

best street worker I ever saw.

HOOKER

He had you down as a big-timer.

What happened?

GONDORFF

Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida

on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear.

He thought he was gonna take over

General Electric.  Some Chantoozie

woke him up, though, and he put the

feds on me.

HOOKER

You mean you blew it.

GONDORFF

(pause)

Luther didn't tell me you had a big

mouth.

HOOKER

He didn't tell me you was a fuck-

up, either.

(Gondorff looks at

him coldly)

You played the Big Con since then.

GONDORFF

No, I lammed it around for a while

while things cooled off.  Philly,

Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.

GONDORFF

But don't kid yourself, friend, I

still know how.

GONDORFF

(getting up from the

floor and emptying

the water out of his pockets)

You gonna stay for breakfast, or do

you already know how to eat?

HOOKER

(tired)

I picked something up on the way.

GONDORFF

(sensing something)

Lonnegan after you, too?

HOOKER

I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.

GONDORFF

You never do, kid.

FLOYD

We got word from Chicago.  They got

one of the grifters last night.

The nigger.

LONNEGAN

What about the other one?

FLOYD

They're still looking for him.

LONNEGAN

Who's got the contract?

FLOYD

Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

LONNEGAN

Hackers.

FLOYD

They staked out the other guy's

place last night, but he never

showed.  They figure maybe he

skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em

up?

LONNEGAN

You see the guy in the red sweater

over there?

LONNEGAN

Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy

we called him.  Runs a few

protection rackets for Carnello

while he's waiting for something

bigger to come along.  Me and Danny

been friends since we were six.

Take a good look at that face,

Floyd, cause if he ever finds out

we let one lousy grifter beat us,

you'll have to kill him and every

other hood in Chicago who'd like to

do the same thing.  You understand

what I'm sayin'?

FLOYD

Yes sir.

LONNEGAN

Good lad.

CUT TO:

BILLIE

You feeling all right this morning,

Henry?

GONDORFF

Fine, Billie.

BILLIE

You mind opening the round a little

early today?  We got some business

coming in before hours.

GONDORFF

(to Hooker)

Great little countess, that Billie.

Runs a good house up there, too.

One of the few left that Luciano

doesn't own.

HOOKER

(getting impatient)

Gondorff, you gonna teach me the

Big Con or not?

GONDORFF

(on his back, checking

underneath one of the horses)

You didn't act much like you wanted

to learn it.

HOOKER

I wanna play for Lonnegan.

GONDORFF

(getting up)

You know anything about him?

HOOKER

(exploding)

Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else

do I gotta know.

HOOKER

(waving Gondorff off,

embarrassed at his

own outburst)

Aw right, he runs the numbers outta

the south side.

GONDORFF

(going over to start

the machinery)

And a packing company, a chain of

Savings and Loans and half the

politicians in Chicago and New York.

There ain't a fix in the world

gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

HOOKER

I'll take him anyway.

GONDORFF

(whirling on him)

Why?

HOOKER

(like steel)

'Cause I don't know enough about

killin' to kill him.

GONDORFF

You can't do it alone, ya know.  It

takes a mob of guys like you and

enough money to make 'em look good.

HOOKER

We'll get by without 'em.

GONDORFF

This isn't like playin' winos on

the street.  You gotta do more than

outrun the guy.

HOOKER

(incensed)

I never played for winos.

GONDORFF

(going right on,

ignoring Hooker's remark)

You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even

after you spent his money.  And no

matter how much you take from his,

he'll get more.

HOOKER

You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?

GONDORFF

Right down to my socks, turkey.  If

I'da been half as scared a that

lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep

on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me,

but at least he won't bore me to

death.

HOOKER

Then you'll do it?

GONDORFF

If I can find a mob that'll risk it.

But no matter what happens, I don't

want you comin' back to me halfway

through and sayin' it's not enough...

cause it's all you got.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TWIST

(showing Hooker

photographs of three men)

These are Combs' favorite torpedoes.

Riley and Cole.

TWIST

They do most of the small jobs, but

Lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on

you 'cause they're kinda messy.  No

class.

TWIST

We got reason to believe Riley was

the guy who hit Luther.  But if you

see either one of these two, find

yourself a crowd, or take 'em

someplace you know you can handle

'em.

GONDORFF

But most of all let us know.  If

they got a hit on you, we gotta

fold up the con.  You're too

exposed.  You got that?

HOOKER

You sure it'll be one of these two?

TWIST

No.  They're just the only ones we

know of.

BILLIE

(to the bartender)

Set me up five more beers, will ya

Danny.

SNYDER

You the owner here?

BILLIE

That's right.

SNYDER

(flipping out his badge)

Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.

BILLIE

Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut

much up here.

SNYDER

(trying to ignore her remark)

I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam

from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought

he mighta come in here.

BILLIE

Don't think so.  I know everybody

in the place and I always bounce

the lamsters.

SNYDER

All right if I look around your

lobby?

BILLIE

No, but you're welcome to a free

beer before you go.

SNYDER

(with controlled force)

I don't really need your permission.

CUT TO:

SINGLETON

Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's

not gonna sit still for a standard

play.

GONDORFF

Everybody'll sit still for somethin'.

What did ya find out about the

train, Eddie?

NILES

He's been taking the 8:10 Century

Limited outa New York on Friday and

getting in here early Saturday

morning.  He usually stays a day to

check on his policy operations, and

then flies back.

GONDORFF

Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

NILES

The porters say he runs a braced

card game in one of the cars.  $100

minimum, straight poker.  Last time

he pulled in here ten grand heavier

than he left New York.

GONDORFF

Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

TWIST

Lotta plungers ride that train just

to play him.

GONDORFF

(breaking into a smile)

See J.J., he's slowly down already.

CUT TO:

SNYDER

Which way are the rooms?

BILLIE

Who told ya this guy was in here?

SNYDER

Nobody.  I just know what kinda

women he likes.  I'm gonna check

all the joyhouses till I find him.

BILLIE

Maybe I could help ya if ya told me

his name.

SNYDER

I think I'll keep that to myself.

Which way are the rooms?

BILLIE

Right through there.  But I wouldn't

go in there if I were you.

(picks up the tray)

SNYDER

(snidely)

What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

BILLIE

I don't have to.  You'll be bustin'

in on the Chief of Police just up

the hall.

(she exits with the drinks)

SNYDER

Keep your nose clean, lady.  He

can't spend all his time here.

CUT TO:

SINGLETON

I think we ought to play him on the

Rag.  It's the tightest game we

got, and it's not all over the

papers yet.

NILES

No good, J.J.  You're not gonna con

stocks to a banker.  Lonnegan's too

smart for that.

TWIST

What are you going to do, con the

payoff to a gambler?

SNYDER

Twist is right.  It won't work.

GONDORFF

We'll use the wire.  Never known a

gambler who wouldn't like to beat

the ponies.

NILES

The wire is ten years outa date.

GONDORFF

That's why he won't know it.

SINGLETON

I'm not sure I know it.

GONDORFF

We'll give him the hook on the

train, and play him here.  You

think I can get in that poker game,

Eddie?

NILES

All you gotta do is show up with

some money and look like a fool.

GONDORFF

I also gotta win.

GONDORFF

By the way, any of you guys been

passing off any green goods lately?

GONDORFF

Billie, if that Dick comes in

again, stall him till I can get a

look at him.  And let me pay ya for

these beers.

BILLIE

What are you talking about?  It's

on the house.

GONDORFF

(pulling out a $5 bill)

Naw, I want ya to have this.

GONDORFF

Don't look at it till ya go to bed

though or it'll turn to paper.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

NILES

Looks all right.  It's big enough

and off the street.

GARFIELD

I don't know.  This is kinda short

notice.  I'm not sure we can get it

all done by Saturday.

NILES

Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark

in from New York on the Century.

TWIST

We'll take it.

(pointing through the door)

You manage the building at the end

of the alley?

OLD MAN

(with pride)

For fifteen years.

TWIST

I'll need a room over there that

faces this way.  How much a week?

OLD MAN

Only rents by the month.  Two

hundred and fifty for the two of

them.

TWIST

(pulling out his wallet)

This is the last time I expect to

see you down here.

OLD MAN

(watching the bills

being counted into

his hand)

Never heard of the place.

GARFIELD

Been a while since I stocked a wire

store.  Not many mobs playing that

anymore.

NILES

All we need is the bookie setup for

now.  We'll worry about the

telegraph office later.

GARFIELD

All right, I'll rent ya everything

I got in the warehouse for two

grand.  That'll give ya phones,

cages, blackboards and ticker gear.

You supply the guys to move 'em.

If you want a counter and bar,

that's another grand.  I don't know

where the hell I'm gonna get 'em

though.

NILES

C'mon, you can do better than that.

We ain't no heel grifters.

GARFIELD

You want the stuff tomorrow or

don't ya?  It's gonna take hours

just to clean it up.

(pause)

Besides, Gondorff's still a hot

item.  Where am I gonna be if he

gets hit?

NILES

Just give us what ya can, Benny.

We'll send a truck down.

TWIST

(to Garfield)

You wanna work flat rate or

percentage?

GARFIELD

Who's the mark?

TWIST

Doyle Lonnegan.

GARFIELD

Flat rate.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

(eyes fixed on Lonnegan)

Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey

fedora.

HOOKER

He's not as tough as he'd like to

think.

GONDORFF

(picking up his suitcase)

Neither are we.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

I hear there's a friendly poker

game on this train tonight.  You

know anything about that?

CONDUCTOR

A little.

GONDORFF

You think you could get me in that

game?

CONDUCTOR

I don't know.  There's usually a

waiting list.

CONDUCTOR

(loosening up a bit)

That'll get you first alternate, sir.

CONDUCTOR

(taking the money)

I'll see what I can do.

CUT TO:

TWIST

(going right on through)

How ya doin', Lacey.

LACEY

(innocently pleased

for one so menacing)

Good to see ya again, Twist.

BOUDREAU

Twist!  When did you get back in

town?

TWIST

Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big

one with Gondorff on the North Side.

TWIST

Listen Duke, we're setting up a

wire store.  I need a twenty man

boost right away.

BOUDREAU

I got twenty or so in here tonight.

Take your pick.

TWIST

These guys have gotta be the quill,

Duky.  We can't afford to rank the

joint.

BOUDREAU

(to one of his assistants)

Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see

who's in town.

CUT TO:

BOUDREAU

Twist, you know this guy?

TWIST

(taking a look

through the viewing port)

No.  Never saw him before.  He's a

dick, though.

EIRIE KID

Hello, Snyder.  What are you doin'

up here?

SNYDER

I'm on vacation.  You seen your

friend lately?

EIRIE KID

Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled

in detective school.

SNYDER

You see him, you tell him to pay

his debts before I get him.

CUT TO:

BOUDREAU

Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the

Big Alabama are in from New Orleans.

Fiskin and the Boone Kid from

Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and

Limehouse Chappie from New York.

Those and the guys outside should

give ya 30 or so to choose from.

TWIST

Good, have 'em down at Stenner's

old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're

gonna run through the route tonight.

BOUDREAU

Okay, Twist, but you know if this

blows up, I can't do ya no good

downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.

TWIST

Don't worry about it, pal.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SINGLETON

You in?

GONDORFF

Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay-

ducer a C-note.  You find out the

deck?

SINGLETON

He usually plays with a Royal or a

Cadenza.

(handing him two

sealed decks)

I got you one of each.  He likes to

cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

GONDORFF

Nice work, J.J.

WOMAN

(sloppy drunk)

Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug.

If I'da wanted you handlin' me I

woulda asked ya.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

She got him clean.  He hasn't

missed it.

GONDORFF

Fifteen grand.  Looks like he's

expecting a big night.

HOOKER

He's waitin' for you in the card

room.

GONDORFF

Let him wait.

GONDORFF

You just worry about your end, kid.

HOOKER

If we ever get to it.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

(to the Conductor)

Where the hell is this guy?

CONDUCTOR

I don't know.  He said he'd be here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

All right, let's start without him.

Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

GONDORFF

Sorry I'm late boys.  I was takin'

a crap.

CONDUCTOR

(making the

introductions;

referring first to Gondorff)

Mr. Shaw is a bookmaker from

Chicago.  Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.

Clayton from Pittsburgh, Mr.

Jameson, Chicago, Mr. Lonnegan, New

York and Mr. Lombard, Philadelphia.

CONDUCTOR

Straight poker, gentlemen.  100

dollar minimum, table stakes.  We

assume you're good for your debts.

LONNEGAN

(shuffling the cards)

Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie

at this table.  If you don't have

one, we can get ya one.

GONDORFF

Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr.

Lonneman.

LONNEGAN

(irritated)

Lonnegan.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CURLY

Name's Curly Jackson.  I worked for

Gad Bryan outa Baltimore.

TWIST

You ever played the Wire, Curly?

CURLY

Used to rope for it long ago.  I

can shill, mark board, anything you

want.  I don't run with riffraff

and I only drink on weekends.

(affecting an English accent)

Me specialty is an Englishman.

TWIST

All right, Curly, you're in.  We

got a rack of suits over there.

Get yourself a nice tweed one.

CURLY

(exiting)

That's all right.  I got all my own

stuff.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

(throwing chips in)

Raise 500.

GONDORFF

(likewise)

See ya and raise three.

LONNEGAN

(more chips)

See and raise five.

GONDORFF

Five and call.

GONDORFF

Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's

what you get for playin' with your

head up your ass.  Couple more like

that and we can all go to bed

early, huh boys.

CUT TO:

GARFIELD

We bought ya a tap into Moe

Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at

every track in the country.  You'll

get race results, odds, scratches,

pole positions, everything; and

just as fast as Western Union gets

'em.

NILES

Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

GARFIELD

All he's gotta do is read.

DUFF

Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's

boost in Troy.

TWIST

You the Duff that didn't come up

with his end when Little Jeff was

sent up?

DUFF

Wasn't no problem a mine.

TWIST

He was a con man, wasn't he?

DUFF

He was a tear-off rat.  He got what

he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay

his bills.

TWIST

(like ice)

Shove off, Duff.

EIRIE KID

(nervous as hell)

Names's Joe Eirie.

TWIST

You played for any particular mobs?

EIRIE KID

No.

TWIST

You know the Wire at all?

EIRIE KID

No...I never played no Big Con

before.  But Luther Coleman was a

friend a mine.  I thought maybe

there was something I could do.

TWIST

(pointing to Eirie

slightly swollen nose)

You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's

tonight?

TWIST

You got moxie, Eirie.  Get yourself

a suit.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

Raise 300.

LONNEGAN

Pass.

JAMESON

(throwing in his last

few chips)

Raise 200.

GONDORFF

Two and call.

JAMESON

Well, I'm out.

GONDORFF

Don't worry about it, pal.  Lemongan

here wouldn'ta let you in the game

if you weren't a chump.

LONNEGAN

(getting to his feet)

I've had enough of your lip, Shaw.

GONDORFF

(barely able to stand up)

Just take it easy there, Larrabee.

JAMESON

Let's take a break for a couple

minutes and cool off.

LONNEGAN

(to his assistant)

I've had it with that bum, Floyd.

Stack me a cooler.

FLOYD

(trying to settle him down)

You've only been playin three

hours, Doyle.

LONNEGAN

(not to be pacified)

I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set

it up for threes and nines.  I'll

cut it in on his deal.

FLOYD

(taking a deck and

beginning to sort it)

What do ya want the others to get?

LONNEGAN

Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there

early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard

in one play.

CUT TO:

CLAYTON

(opening the bidding)

Fold.

LONNEGAN

250.

GONDORFF

Raise 1,000.

LONNEGAN

Raise 500.

GONDORFF

(slowly)

Raise 2,000.

LONNEGAN

See and raise 1,000.

GONDORFF

(taking it to him)

Raise 5,000.

LONNEGAN

(going for broke)

See, and raise the rest.

GONDORFF

Call.

GONDORFF

(raking in the chips)

Well that's all for me tonight,

boys.  I'm gonna leave ya some cab

fare.

GONDORFF

(to Lonnegan)

You owe me 15 grand, pal.

LONNEGAN

(getting up to get it)

I guess I left it in my room.

GONDORFF

(blowing up)

What!  Don't give me that crap you

little weenie.  How do I know you

ain't gonna take a powder.

(waving his wallter,

which is full of

Lonnegan's money)

You come to a game like this, you

bring your money.

GONDORFF

All right, buddy, I'm gonna send a

boy by your room in five minutes,

and you better have that jack, or

it's gonna be all over Chicago that

your name ain't worth a dime.

HOOKER

How'd ya do?

GONDORFF

(modestly)

Well we got some workin' money

anyway.

GONDORFF

(big smile)

Okay, kid, you're on.  But I gotta

tell ya, its a hard act to follow.

CUT TO:

FLOYD

I know I give him four threes.  We

can't let him get away with that.

LONNEGAN

What am I supposed to do?  Call him

for cheating better than me?

HOOKER

My name's Carver.  Mr. Shaw sent me.

LONNEGAN

Your boss is quite a card player,

Carver.  How does he do it?

HOOKER

(very matter-of-factly)

He cheats.

LONNEGAN

(reaching into his

coat pocket)

He'll have to take a check.

(pulling out a check)

I couldn't find my wallet.

HOOKER

Yeh, he knows that.

LONNEGAN

(startled)

What do you mean?

HOOKER

(pulling out

Lonnegan's wallet and

tossing it to him)

He hired a dame to take it from ya.

HOOKER

You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's

been planning to beat your game for

months.  He was just waiting for

you to cheat him so he could clip ya.

LONNEGAN

(the heat rising)

I could have you put under this

train for this, errand boy.

HOOKER

(cool as hell)

So could Shaw.

LONNEGAN

Then why the rat?

HOOKER

Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.

(pause)

I want you to help me break him.

LONNEGAN

(to Hooker)

C'mon, I'll give ya a lift home.

LONNEGAN

What's the matter?  You gotta get

back to Shaw?

HOOKER

Naw, he picked up some jane in the

bar.  Can't see him till morning

anyway.

LONNEGAN

All right, then.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa

enemies to choose from.

HOOKER

I need somebody respectable...but

not completely legit.  What I'm

gonna do isn't very legal.

LONNEGAN

(insulted)

I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit

in this state.

HOOKER

All you gotta do is place a bet for

me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply

all the money and the information.

HOOKER

If you help me out, I'll pay ya

back the money you owe Shaw, myself.

LONNEGAN

That's worth fifteen grand to ya?

HOOKER

Maybe a couple million.

LONNEGAN

You're dreamin', kid.

HOOKER

(getting out)

660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at

12:30, if you're interested.

LONNEGAN

(diffidently)

If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm

not coming.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF (V.O.)

Everything go all right?

HOOKER (V.O.)

(lying)

Yeh, it was easy.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

No signs of trouble?

HOOKER

What do ya mean?

GONDORFF

You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A

torpedo or somethin'.

HOOKER

(wanting to get off

the subject)

No, not a thing.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF (V.O.)

How 'bout Lonnegan?

HOOKER (V.O.)

I gave him the breakdown just like

ya told me to.

GONDORFF (V.O.)

And?

HOOKER (V.O.)

He threatened to kill me.

GONDORFF (V.O.)

Hell, they don't do that and you

know you're not gettin' through to

'em.

HOOKER (V.O.)

Then he drove me home.  He tried to

put himself away as legit, so I

went right into the pitch.

GONDORFF (V.O.)

Did he hold you up on anything?

HOOKER (V.O.)

Naw, he just sat there and listened.

I don't know if he bought it or not.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF (V.O.)

That's all right.  Once they start

listening, they're in trouble.

Just don't give him more than he

asks for.  If you rattle his

imagination a little, he'll come up

with all the right answers himself.

But all he's gotta do is catch you

in one lie and you're dead.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

You think he'll show?

GONDORFF

Did he say he wouldn't?

HOOKER

No.

GONDORFF

(softly)

He'll show.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

Eddie, cut that out, will ya.

CUT TO:

VOICE

Carver?

LONNEGAN

You should always look to the back

too, kid.

HOOKER

(sliding out of his

booth and into Lonnegan's)

I was afraid you weren't gonna come.

We haven't got much time.

LONNEGAN

(curtly)

Get on with it then.

HOOKER

(pointing to telephone)

Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna

call here and give you the name of

a horse.

(pulling out a wad of bills)

All you do is take this two grand

across the street to Shaw's place

and bet it on that pony.  There's

nothin' to it, but don't take too

much time.  We only have 3 or 4

minutes after you get the call.

LONNEGAN

You're not gonna break him with a

$2,000 bet.

HOOKER

This is just a test.  The big one

comes later.  Be careful with that

though, it's all I got.

LONNEGAN

And you were gonna pay me back?

HOOKER

I am after this race.

HOOKER

I gotta get back before Shaw misses

me.  Good luck.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

We're waitin' for a call.

CUT TO:

TWIST

Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose.

SINGLETON

Look at that.  He's got four apes

with him.

GONDORFF

That's what I like about these

guys, J.J... They always got

protection against things we'd

never do to 'em.

SHEET WRITER

Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing

Cloud.

GONDORFF

Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd

think you'd get tired of losin',

Honnigan.

LONNEGAN

(piercingly)

The name is Lonnegan.

GONDORFF

(to Niles)

Make sure you see cash from this

guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for

bettin' money he don't have.

LONNEGAN

Two-thousand on Bluenote.

NILES

(writing out a ticket)

Is that all?

LONNEGAN

(pissed)

That's all.

CALLER

Ladies and Gentlemen.  This is

Arnold Rowe, your caller for the

second race at Belmont in New York.

A mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and

up.  And they're off!

CALLER

Around the first turn it's a War

Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate

second by one and a half, Dancing

Cloud third by a half on the

outside, followed by Lucky Lady,

Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote.

GONDORFF

(worried)

That's not where we want him to sit.

EIRIE KID

C'mon War Eagle.

(to Lonnegan)

That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a

finisher.  War Eagle's gonna have

to open up a little more on 'em.

LONNEGAN

You know anything about a horse

named Bluenote?

EIRIE KID

Naw, he's never done much.  Probably

in here just to round out the field.

War Eagle's where you wanna have

your money.

CALLER

Into the clubhouse turn, it's War

Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud

has moved up to second by a half,

Lucky Lady is third by three

followed by Jail Bait, Mojo,

Bluenote and Wits' End.

LONNEGAN

(out of the corner of

his mouth)

You really picked a winner, kid.

HOOKER

Give 'em a little time.

CALLER

Into the backstretch it's War Eagle

still by a length, Dancing Cloud

closing on the inside, is second by

two, Lucky Lady is third by one and

a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail

Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

HOOKER

You're doin' great, Eirie.  He

loves ya.

CALLER

Into the far turn, it's Dancing

Cloud now by half a length, War

Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is

third by a half and moving fast on

the outside.  Lucky Lady is fourth

by four lengths, followed by Jail

Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

CALLER

Coming down the stretch, it's

Dancing Cloud by one length, War

Eagle and Bluenote are neck and

neck by two.  Now it's Dancing

Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle.

(shouting now)

Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to

head...

CALLER

Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  Dancing

Cloud, Bluenote.  It's Bluenote by

a nose.  Dancing Cloud is second by

two, War Eagle third by three and a

half.  Time for a mile and 1/8,

2:01 and 6/10 seconds.

CURLY

(tearing up his ticket)

Bloody awful.  Who in blazes is

Bluenote?

LONNEGAN

(to Eirie, very self-satisfied)

War Eagle's where you want to have

your money, huh?

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

(getting his name

right this time)

Don't bother to come back with a

piker's bet like that again,

Lonnegan.  We got a $5,000 minimum

here.

(to Hooker)

Show this bum out.

GONDORFF

Go on, ya goddamn ninny.

GONDORFF

(indicating Lonnegan's

bodyguards)

And tell him not to bring his

garbage men in here no more.  This

is a class joint.

GONDORFF

He's gaffed, kid.  He should start

coming to you now.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

All right, Riley.  What the hell

happened?

RILEY

(not looking at him)

We missed him.

LONNEGAN

You weren't hired to miss him.

RILEY

There wasn't any way he coulda

known we was in there.  We made a

clean pick on the lock and didn't

leave no footprints in the hall.

Somebody musta wised him up.

LONNEGAN

Yeh, and what does Cole say about

that?

RILEY

I don't know.  He took it hard.

LONNEGAN

All right, get outa here.  You're

outta work.

LONNEGAN

We'll put Salino on it.  I need

somebody careful.

COMBS

Salino?  Why waste our best people

on a small-time job like this?  It

ain't no heavy gee we're after.

The guy's a five and dime grifter.

LONNEGAN

Then why ain't he dead?

COMBS

They didn't think he'd be so cagey,

that's all.  They'll get him next

time.

LONNEGAN

Use Salino.  It'll take a little

longer, but there won't be any

holes in it.

LONNEGAN

And tell Cole I wanta see him when

he gets in.

COMBS

He's not comin' in.  Not to get

bounced off a job anyway.

LONNEGAN

He had his chance and all he did

was shoot up a rooming house.  Made

a lotte noise and woke up a few

cops, but didn't hit nothin'.

LONNEGAN

(cooling a little)

This is Salino's job now, Vince.

If Cole wants to muscle in on it,

that's his business.  But he's

breakin' the rules and when Salino

finds out about it, I can't feel

sorry for what's gonna happen to him.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

Well, what did I tell ya?

LONNEGAN

You're a lucky man, all right.

HOOKER

Lucky, hell.  I could do it every

day.

LONNEGAN

Why don't ya then.

HOOKER

'Cause it's better to do it all at

once.

(leaning close)

We're puttin' down 400 grand next

week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million.

Twenty per cent of that is yours if

ya stick with us.

LONNEGAN

You got a system, Carver?

HOOKER

You stayin' in or not?

LONNEGAN

I'm in.

HOOKER

(drawing up a chair,

barely able to

contain his enthusiasm)

It's foolproof.  We got a partner

downtown runs the central office of

the Western Union.  Race results

from all over the country come in

there and go right across his desk

on their way to the bookies.  All

he does in hold them up a couple

minutes until he can call us and

get a bet down on the winner.  Then

he releases the results to the

bookies and we clean up on a race

that's already been run.  It can't

miss, unless the Western Union

Dicks get onto it.

LONNEGAN

You got the 400 grand yet?

HOOKER

Not yet, but...

(stopping suddenly)

Hey, there's only a grand here.

LONNEGAN

(more like a command)

I think we oughta place another bet

tomorrow.

HOOKER

(getting angry)

What is this?  That's my money.

You tryin' to muscle me?

LONNEGAN

(controlled)

If your system's as foolproof as

you say, you'll get even more.

HOOKER

(after a pause)

I gotta talk to me partner first.

We can't afford to expose our game

too much.

LONNEGAN

Let me talk to him.

HOOKER

(flatly)

No.

LONNEGAN

You want your money back?  Try and

get it in a court of law.

(softening a bit)

C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll

make it worth your while.  Migth

even help ya finance the big play

if this one works out.

HOOKER

Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up

at Dewey Lyle's.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HOOKER

Twist?  I told him the tale.  He

wants to see ya.

TWIST

All right, when?

HOOKER

Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside,

I'll come in and get ya.  And be

hard on him for a while; he's

talking money.

TWIST

Okay, Tootsie.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF (V.O.)

Why didn't you tell me about Snyder

before?

HOOKER (V.O.)

I thought I'd lost him.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

Well you found him again and we're

gonna have to do somethin' about it.

What else haven't ya been tellin' me?

HOOKER

Nothin'.  I told ya everything

there is.

GONDORFF

Then why'd ya move outa your room?

HOOKER

It was too noisy.

GONDORFF

You can't play your friends like

marks, Hooker.

GONDORFF

You know how easy it'd be for one

of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?

HOOKER

All we need is a couple days, Henry.

A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan

down and stomp on 'em.

GONDORFF

You just won't learn, will ya.

Hell, you come in here, I teach you

stuff maybe five guys in this world

know, stuff most grifters couldn't

do even if they knew it, and all

you wanna do is run down a bullet.

(pause)

You're just like all them new jerks.

Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten

years from now when me and the

others are through and you dumb

guys are all dead there won't be

one gee left who knows the Big Con

was anything more than a way to

make a livin'.

HOOKER

A couple days; that's all I'm

askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

GONDORFF

(trying to be angry

and failing)

Christ, they'll probably miss you

and hit me.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

LORETTA

You done?

HOOKER

Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat

loaf.

LORETTA

(deadpan)

It isn't any better.

HOOKER

Where's June today?

LORETTA

(figuring up the bill)

She don't work here no more.  I'm

fillin' in for a couple days...

till I can get a train outa here.

HOOKER

Where you goin'?

LORETTA

(putting the check

down and walking away)

I don't know.  Depends what train I

get on.

CUT TO:

TWIST

(to the receptionist)

Excuse me.  We're here to paint Mr.

Harmon's office.

RECEPTIONIST

(obviously not

expecting them)

Mr. Harmon's office?  Hold on just

a second.

She goes to get Mr. Harmon.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

What happened to your face?

HOOKER

Had a little fight with a raggle

down on 13th.  She got me with her

ring.

CUT TO:

HARMON

Brigham signed it all right.  I

can't understand why he didn't tell

me.

SINGLETON

Ah, he's like all them supervisors.

They think they're too good for

regular people.  He says he was in

here a while ago and the place was

a mess.

TWIST

We'll try and hurry so we don't

keep you out of your office too long.

HARMON

Why can't I work with you in there?

SINGLETON

Look pal, we gotta cover the floor,

the furniture, everything, so we

don't spill on nothing.  Now if you

wanta sit in there with a tarp over

your head, you're welcome to it.

HARMON

All right, how long will you be?

TWIST

Hour or two at the most.  We do

good work.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

We'll go to the side door.

HOOKER

Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me.

He wants to see you a second.

TWIST

(irritated)

What the hell's the matter with you.

We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

HOOKER

I thought it might be good for him

to see the setup.

TWIST

(hushed)

Well we can't talk in here.  They're

having the place painted.

TWIST

(talking into the intercom)

Miss Barnes, I'm going home a

little early today.  Tell anyone

that calls that they can reach me

here in the morning.  Thank you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TWIST

Can't do it.  There're telegraph

inspectors all over the place.  I

got 750 grand coming in from the

coast, and I'm not gonna blow it

for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get

somebody else to do our betting.

LONNEGAN

I could come up with 750 grand in a

day if I had a reason to.

TWIST

But who says you will.  I got a guy

I can depend on.  He's liquidating

everything he has for this.  You

wouldn't even give Carver his money

back.

LONNEGAN

I need more proof, that's all.

Anybody can get lucky once.

TWIST

(stubbornly)

On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya.

We'll keep the deal we got.

LONNEGAN

If it works again tomorrow, I'll

have a half million in cash here by

noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

TWIST

(feebly, beginning to break)

We were getting 50 from our guy.

LONNEGAN

With 20% coming off the top for me

laying your bet.  Either way you

end up with 40.

LONNEGAN

A week's a long time, friend.

Anything can happen.  All of it bad.

HOOKER

He's right, Les.

TWIST

Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow

and he doesn't come up with the

money.  We risk our whole operation

for nothing.  I'll say when we make

our bets.

LONNEGAN

Not if you want me to keep makin'

'em for ya.

HOOKER

And what do we know about your guy.

He says a week, but who knows if

it's a month?  Lonnegan here's a

banker.  He can get that dough with

no questions asked.

TWIST

All right.  Be at the booth at 1:00.

I'll give you all three places this

time, Lonnegan.  That better be

proof enough.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

MAN

Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

SNYDER

I don't know, what's up?

MAN

F.B.I... The Captain'd like a few

words with ya.  Ya got a couple

minutes?

SNYDER

(completely floored)

Yeh, sure.

CUT TO:

SNYDER

What is this?  I got work to do.

POLK

Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try

not to live up to all my

expectations.

(not in the mood to

screw around)

We were told you know a hustle

artist named Johnny Hooker.

POLK

Do ya know him or don't ya?

SNYDER

Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

POLK

Well we do.  He's chummin' around

with a Big C named Henry Gondorff.

Ring any bells?

SNYDER

Sure.  Every bunco man in the

country knows Gondorff.

POLK

There's word he's gonna run a con

on the North Side here.  We got a

year-old Florida warrant on him,

but it's a thin beef, and he can

beat it in court unless we catch

him cold.  All we want you to do is

pick up Hooker for us.

SNYDER

Why don't you pick him up yourself?

POLK

Cause the stoolies are used to

street dicks jumpin' him.  If word

gets around that Feds are in on it

too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole

thing.

SNYDER

Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd

hafta move outa this nice office ya

got.

POLK

(enraged)

Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot.

I spent a lotta time in dumps like

this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while

the bunco squad gets rich tippin'

him off.  But it's not gonna happen

this time.  We're not even gonna

let the police know we're here.  If

you keep your mouth shut and do a

job, there'll be a promotion in it

for ya.  And you better take it,

cause I can make ya work for us

without it.

SNYDER

What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

POLK

He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

SNYDER

He'll never do it.

POLK

(self-satisfied)

I think he will.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SINGLETON

Visitation is still up by two at

the three-quarters.  Single Action

second, Fasanella third.

BILLIE

What's the line on Visitation?

SINGLETON

(checking further up

on the print-out sheet)

7 to 2.  That ain't bad.

BILLIE

He'll probably fall down.

GONDORFF

How ya doin'?

SINGLETON

(eyes still glued to

the ticker)

Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on

the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

BILLIE

Best we had was Cat's Eye in the

second at Del Mar, and he was only

5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in

today.

SINGLETON

(excited)

Billie.  You ready?

BILLIE

Yeh, go ahead.

SINGLETON

At the finish, it's Single Action

by two, Fasanella second, Visitation

third.

(reading up the sheet again)

Line on Single Action... 3 to 2.

Hell with it, that's no good.

GONDORFF

We don't need big odds on this one,

J.J.  Take anything you get at 3-1

or better.

SINGLETON

(a little weary)

Okay, the Fairfield Stakes at Santa

Anita.  Mile and a quarter for 3

year olds and up.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand,

Eddie.  How much cash we got?

NILES

Not enough to cover a bet that big.

GONDORFF

Get a couple extra guys in the

line, then.  We'll give him the

shut-out.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SINGLETON

Okay, Billie, here we go.

SINGLETON

At the wire it's Wrecking Crew the

winner by five, Grand Theft second,

Wingless third.

(reading up)

Wrecking Crew was...4 to 1.

(ripping the sheet

out of the ticker)

That's our boy.

CUT BACK TO:

GONDORFF

All right, Furey, your horse is

Wingless.  Paltrow, the Big Alabama

and Phillips'll take Grand Theft.

Rodgers and Eirie have Wrecking

Crew.  Jackson -- His Dandy,

Cowan -- Change of Heart, Fiskin

and Chappie -- Made to Order.

(pointing to the

Eirie Kid)

Eirie, he gets a bang outa seein'

you lose, so we oughta use that on

'em.  If you play the birds of a

feather routine we worked on, it

should steam him up pretty good.

You think you can handle that?

EIRIE KID

(a little nervous)

Yeh, sure.

GONDORFF

O.K., you guys in line take your

time, and I wanta see lotsa joy on

Wrecking Crew.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE

Wrecking Crew at 4-1, Grand Theft

to place, Made to Order to show.

CUT TO:

LONNEGAN

(getting impatient)

C'mon, let's hurry up there.

CALLER

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is

Arnold Rowe, your caller for the

$100,000 Fairfield Stakes at

Hollywood Park in Los Angeles.  A

mile and 3/8 for three year olds

and up.  And they're off!

LONNEGAN

(counting out his money)

Twenty-thousand on Wrecking Crew.

NILES

I'm sorry, sir.  We can't take bets

after the race is started.

GONDORFF

Don't take it so hard, pal.  You

probably woulda lost it.

CALLER

And around the first turn it's

Wrecking Crew by a half length,

Grand Theft second by one, His

Dandy is third by one half, followed

by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made

to Order and High Ground.

EIRIE KID

Who you got?

LONNEGAN

(half-heartedly)

Wrecking Crew.

EIRIE KID

Me too.  Maybe it's our day.

HOOKER

What happened?

LONNEGAN

I didn't get the bet down in time.

HOOKER

(pissed)

Oh, Jesus.

CUT TO:

NILES

(looking out at the floor)

Looks like he's sulking.

GONDORFF

If we're lucky, this'll bring him

back stronger than ever.

CUT TO:

CALLER

Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew

by six lengths, Made to Order is

second by two and a half, High

Ground is third by a length and

Grand Theft is coming fast on the

rail.  It's Wrecking Crew, Made to

Order and Grand Theft.  Wrecking

Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand

Theft is second by a nose, Made to

Order is third by two.  Time for

one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10

seconds.

EIRIE KID

We won!  We won!  You hear that!  I

won 30,000!  You hear that!

LONNEGAN

Tell your friend I'll have the

money here by post-time tomorrow.

We'll take the first race where the

odds are 4-1 or better.  And make

sure I can get to that window this

time.

HOOKER

How am I gonna do that?

LONNEGAN

(coarsely)

I don't know, figure something out.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of

coffee.

LORETTA

(ringing it up)

Sixty-five.

HOOKER

What time you get off work here?

LORETTA

2:00 A.M.

HOOKER

You doin' anything tonight?

LORETTA

(handing him his change)

Yeh, sleepin'.

HOOKER

You got a back door to this place?

LORETTA

No.  What's wrong with the front?

HOOKER

(urgently now)

Look, I don't have time to fuck

around.  There's somebody out there

I don't need to see.  You got a

fire escape or anything?

LORETTA

No.

HOOKER

All right, do me a favor.  Go into

the bathroom, open the window and

wait for me there.

LORETTA

What the hell for?

HOOKER

Just do what I tell ya and

everything'll be jake.

LORETTA

What does this guy want?

HOOKER

(evenly)

He'd like to kill me.

COLE

Salino, hey look.  I didn't mean to

move in on...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

POLK

Hello, Mr. Hooker.  Captain Polk,

F.B.I...

(shoving a chair over

to him)

Have a seat.

POLK

(ignoring it, drinking

from a cup)

You want a drink or something?

HOOKER

No.

POLK

We want to talk to ya about Henry

Gondorff.

HOOKER

Don't think I know him.

POLK

Well give yourself a couple seconds,

crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to

me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done

a lotta griftin' in this town.

HOOKER

Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

HOOKER

You got nothin' on me.

POLK

We'll get it, and if we can't,

we'll just make it up.  Grand

larceny, extortion.

(with special emphasis)

Counterfeiting, anything you want.

POLK

Look, I got nothin' against you,

but you're in trouble here.  All

you gotta do is tell us when

Gondorff's gonna play his chump.

We come in at the sting, make the

pinch, and you walk out free as a

bird.  No questions, no court

appearance, nothing.

HOOKER

No.

POLK

You've already done time twice, and

judges don't like three time losers.

You wanna sit in the can for forty

years, startin' tonight?

HOOKER

I'll make parole.

POLK

Like hell.  You won't even get a

review till you're seventy.  And if

the board starts to go soft, we'll

let ya out in the yard some night

with a hard-nose young bull who'll

put fifty slugs in your face and

ask what you were doin' there later.

POLK

Don't be a sap, kid.  You could

save us a little trouble.  But

Henry Gondorff is through whether

you help us or not.  There's

nothin' left to do now but save

yourself.

HOOKER

(softly)

Will you wait until the chump is

played?

POLK

Hell yes.  We don't care about the

mark.  He deserves what he gets.

HOOKER

(with heat)

I mean completely played.  Until

he's beat and the score is taken.

You come in before we beat him and

I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough

time explaining that, won't ya.

POLK

All right, Hooker, but you take it

on the lam, and we'll shoot you

down on sight.

HOOKER

(barely audible)

Just as long as I get to finish the

play.

CUT TO:

GONDORFF

What's the matter, kid?  You're not

sayin' much.

HOOKER

Just a little nervous, that's all.

GONDORFF

Luther always told me to bite my

toenails when I get nervous.  You

see yourself doin' that and you

realize it ain't worth it.

BILLIE

Things are a little slow tonight,

Henry.  I wanna open the round for

the girls.

GONDORFF

Take it easy, you won't lose him

now.  We had him 10 years ago when

he decided to be somebody.  Believe

me, I've seen enough to know.

HOOKER

(softly)

How many guys you conned in your

life, Henry?

GONDORFF

Two or three hundred I guess.

Sometimes played two a day when I

was in Shea's mob.  We had it down

to a business.

(pause)

'Course Chicago was a right town

then.  The fix was in.  The dicks

took their end without a beef.  All

the Wall Street boys wanted to make

investments for us.  Even had marks

looking us up, thinkin' they could

beat the game.

(pause)

Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No

sense in bein' a grifter if it's

the same as bein' a citizen.

GONDORFF

I better do some packin'.  I'm

gonna be a hot number again after

tomorrow.

HOOKER

Then why you doin' it?

GONDORFF

Seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

Maybe it's just for the cave-in on

Lonnegan's face when we put in the

sting.

HOOKER

Henry.

HOOKER

Yeh.

HOOKER

(apologetically)

I appreciate your stickin' your

neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya

if it weren't for Luther.

GONDORFF

Ain't nothin' gonna make up for

Luther, kid.

(pause)

Revenge is for suckers.  I been

griftin' 30 years and never got any.

CUT TO:

LORETTA

Looks like he missed ya.

HOOKER

Yeh, this time anyway.

LORETTA

Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

HOOKER

(shuffling a little)

I, ah...thought you might wanna

come out for a while.  Maybe have a

drink or somethin'.

LORETTA

You move right along, don't ya.

HOOKER

(with more innocence

than confidence)

I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just

don't know many regular girls,

that's all.

LORETTA

And you expect me to come over,

just like that.

HOOKER

If I expected somethin', I wouldn't

be still standin' out here in the

hall.

LORETTA

(with less resistance now)

I don't even know you.

HOOKER

(slowly)

You know me.  I'm just like you...

It's two in the morning and I don't

know nobody.

CUT TO:

BILLIE

C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've

CUT TO:

POLK

(to Snyder)

Whoever Gondorff's playin' for is

bound to be a wheel.  As soon as

we're inside, I want you to get the

can't afford to embarrass any big

shots.

Too many people coulda seen ya go

Used to work in the Dutch Schultz

Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

GONDORFF

What's the problem?

NILES

(pointing to the

brief case)

He wants to put a half million on

Syphon.

GONDORFF

(uneasily)

I can't lay that off in time.  We

lose a bet that big, it could break

us.

LONNEGAN

(challenging)

If ya win it could make ya, too.

GONDORFF

(to Niles)

What are the odds on Syphon?

NILES

Eight to one.

GONDORFF

A half mill on an eight to one shot.

You're dumber than I thought,

Lonnegan.

LONNEGAN

You're more gutless than I thought.

GONDORFF

Take it.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is

King's Image by a neck, Syphon is

Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and

No Charge.

TWIST

Sorry, but I just couldn't wait.

Did everything go all right?

LONNEGAN

(motioning for him to

keep his voice down)

Take it easy.  Everything's all

right.  I put it on Syphon, on the

nose.

TWIST

(in utter horror)

On the nose!  I said place.  Place

it on Syphon.  That horse is going

to run second.

LONNEGAN

You give me my goddamn money back!

You hear me?  There's been a mistake!

NILES

I'm sorry, sir.  The betting's

closed.

LONNEGAN

You give me my money back.  There's

been a mistake, do you hear me?

POLK

(motioning to Hooker)

All right, Hooker, you can go.

SNYDER

C'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.

LONNEGAN

My money's back there.

SNYDER

We'll worry about that later.

And the winner is King's Image by

four lengths, Syphon is second, by

two, Moneyman third by two and one

half.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles,

1:21 and 2/10 seconds.

POLK

He's gone.

GONDORFF

(to Polk)

Nice con, Hickey.  I thought you

were Feds myself, when you first

came in.

HICKEY

No problem, Henry.  Snyder went for

it all the way.

(laughing)

You shoulda seen the rag he lit

under Lonnegan.

GONDORFF

Okay, let's take this place apart

and get outa here.  You can get

your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's

tonight.

GONDORFF

You beat him, kid.

HOOKER

(softly)

You were right, Henry.  It's not

enough... But it's close.

GONDORFF

You wanta wait for your share?

HOOKER

Naw, I'd just blow it.

FADE OUT.
