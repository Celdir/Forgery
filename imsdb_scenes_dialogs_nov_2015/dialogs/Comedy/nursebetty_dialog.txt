Shooting Script (FINAL)

3/9/99

FADE IN:

1     INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY                                1

DAVID

(to Asst. Surgeon)

Close her up, will you?

2     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                             2

BLAKE

There's been a train crash near Santa

Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma

here now.  How can I ask you this,

David...

DAVID

I can do it, Blake.

CHLOE

Is he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his

feet for fourteen hours.

JASMINE

Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie

died.  Losing himself in his work, poor

thing...

2.

YOUNGER MAN'S

VOICE

(O.S.)

... I'll give you something to lose

yourself in...

OLDER MAN'S VOICE

(O.S.)

Excuse me, miss?

3     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 3

OLDER MAN

Miss?

OLDER MAN

(cont'd)

Very impressive.  That is very...

(turning to others)

Did anybody see that?

3.

OLDER MAN

(cont'd)

Thank you.  Could I bother you for a

little more...?

BETTY

Skim, right?

(tears open an Equal)

And half a pack, if I remember correct...

BETTY (cont'd)

You know, you're never too young to start

on a lean meat substitute...

(BEAT)

You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?

YOUNGER MAN

You want a tip when I'm through?

BETTY

It's your body...

YOUNGER MAN

(to himself)

That's right, so why don't you get up off

it...

OLDER MAN

Wesley...

(to Betty)

I've told him the same thing.  Thanks for

the suggestion.

BETTY

No problem.

4.

ROY

Hi, Betty.  You're looking good...

BETTY

Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,

but sweet.  I liked your editorial this

morning...

ROY

Oh, appreciate it.  I was trying to, ahh,

give a sense of history to...

BALLARD

(interrupting)

Yeah, it was great.  Really put the whole

idea of "church bake sales" in

perspective...

ROY

You know, Elden, some people actually

read more than just the Classifieds...

BALLARD

Why don't you go back to doing something

you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts

column?

(chuckles to himself)

I'll take a refill there, Betty...

BETTY

Hey, Sheriff.  How's everything?

BALLARD

Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the

world safe.

BETTY

... I meant your food.

BALLARD

Oh, right... 's fine.  Thanks.

ROY

I thought you said the eggs weren't...

BALLARD

It's fine.  Mind your own meal...

5.

ROY

You should get the order you want.

BALLARD

And you should keep your nose out of

another man's omelette...

(to Betty)

It's no big deal, Betty.

BETTY

There's yolks in there, huh?  It's no

prob'... gotta keep you on track.

BALLARD

Why you always gotta embarrass me?  I

been eating lunch with you since grade

school and you always gotta embarrass me!

ROY

They're just eggs, Elden, how

embarrassing can eggs be?

BALLARD

... plenty

ROY

Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?

BALLARD

Mind your own business.  You just said

that shit so you could look at her a

little longer, anyway...

BETTY

Come on, guys, I told you it's egg whites

only for the Sheriff...

(quietly)

... I put him in that 'zone' thing.

COOK #1

Well, it better be a pretty good size

zone if he's in it...

6.

4     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN             4

LONNIE

Blake, I can handle that transplant!

BLAKE

We need someone with the right kind of

experience, Lonnie.

LONNIE

Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?

BLAKE

Lonnie, it's a complex procedure.  Why

don't you observe?

LONNIE

I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh

out of medical school, Blake.

BLAKE

No, you're not.  You're a good doctor,

Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell.

I've made my decision.  Now, if you'll

excuse me ...

5     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 5

BETTY

Hey!  We were watching that!

COOK #1

The other girls've got orders up... we're

not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families,

y'know.

BETTY

It's "Nielson"...

COOK #1

Yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them,

neither.

7.

(BEAT)

Go on now...

DARLENE

When you gonna get those things fixed,

anyhow?

COOK #1

When you all quit watching 'em for a

living...

6     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME                 6

BETTY

... alright, I get it, no more TV.

Sorry.

BETTY (cont'd)

Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!

Where did you ever find this?

DARLENE

On the goddamn internet, where else?

BETTY

You're joking...

WAITRESS #1

... nope, got him at "T.V. Hunks with

Sweet Little Asses.Com."

WAITRESS #2

Seventy-five dollars...

COOK #1

... Seventy-eight fifty.

(everyone looks at him)

8.

Well, I paid for the damn thing, I oughta

know.

WAITRESS #2

C'mon, Betty!  Pose with him!

DARLENE

One candle... uh-oh, you're getting up

there!  Doesn't David like 'em young?

BETTY

I'm over the hill, what can I say?

WAITRESS #1

A little something for those nursing

classes you've been wanting to take...

DARLENE

... but keep putting off thanks to a

certain husband we won't mention...

BETTY

Oh, guys, you didn't have to do that!

DARLENE

So how you gonna celebrate?  Del takin'

you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?

BETTY

Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe...  Oh, I should

probably call him.  Thanks, you guys...

COOK #1

Alright, alright, come on... I'm not

running no bed & breakfast, we got

customers.  Let's go...

7     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DEL'S OFFICE - DAY                7

9.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(Del's voice)

Hello there!  You've reached Sizemore

Motors, home of the best selection of

used General Motors cars in the Big

Springs - Fair Oaks area.  We can't come

to the phone right now 'cause we're out

making a sale, so leave us a message;

better yet, come on down and steal one 'a

these beauties right out from under us!

Coffee's always on!

BETTY  (V.O.)

Hi Del, it's me.  I guess you're busy.

8     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - TRAILER/OFFICE - DAY              8

BETTY  (V.O.)

I know you want the Oldsmobile back

tonight, so... I was wondering if I could

take one of the new Buicks.

BETTY  (V.O.)

(CONT'D)

So, call me when you--

DEL

Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Hang on a second

there, baby.  Why do you need one of the

new Buicks?

BETTY  (V.O.)

Oh, you're there.  You sound out of

breath.

DEL

I ran back in to get the phone.

10.

BETTY  (V.O.)

I don't need one, but it's kind of a

special night, and--

DEL

What's so special about it?

BETTY  (V.O.)

Sue Ann's taking me out and I thought it

might be fun to go in a nice car...

BETTY (V.O)

(CONT'D)

What was that?

DEL

Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here.  Look,

you don't need a LeSabre to go out with

Sue Ann.  Take the blue Corsica.  I'll

see you when I get home.

DEL (CONT'D)

(through the pane)

Shit!  Joyce, open the damn gate, will

you?!

DEL (cont'd)

... that's what we need, some goddamn

flags.

11.

9     INT. OFFICE/TRAILER - LATER                              9

JOYCE

Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet...

well, once he dumps her we will.

(to Betty)

He's out pricing banners... I don't

expect him back.

BETTY

"Banners?"

JOYCE

You know, flags and shit... he said "for

a livelier look" or something.

JOYCE (cont'd)

'S too bad about the LeSabres... they're

a really sweet ride.

JOYCE (cont'd)

Need something else?

BETTY

No, I was just... How you doing?

JOYCE

Great.  Good.  Content...

BETTY

Oh.  How come?

JOYCE

I dunno.  Job satisfaction, I guess...

(BEAT)

How's things at the Tip Top?

BETTY

They're fine... you miss it?

JOYCE

You must be joking.

12.

BETTY

Hmm.

(BEAT)

So, Del get that car he sold you up and

running yet?

JOYCE

Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running,

alright...

BETTY

'Kay, good.  Bye, then...

JOYCE

Uh-huh.

(back to phone)

Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I

just fucking love pastels.

11     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS/TRAILER PARK - DAY                 11

BETTY

Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?

12     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME                           12

13.

13     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME                        13

BETTY

We deserve this.

15     EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER                       15

16     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                        16

SUE ANN

Hey, darling... oww!  Sorry, got my own

little Gulf War going on here.

14.

BETTY

Did you watch it yet?

SUE ANN

Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was

any better looking it'd be a crime 'a

some sort...

BETTY

Yep.  Hey, I got a surprise for tonight.

We're going to the Starlite in style!

SUE ANN

Oh, Betty--

BETTY

I'll give you a hint.  If you scrunch up

your eyes a bit it looks just like a

Jaguar...

SUE ANN

Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call

you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge

meeting. There's no way I can get a

sitter this fast.

BETTY

(disappointed)

No... what about your sister?

SUE ANN

I can't ask her again-- Nathan, stop it!

Jesse, don't take that, hit back!-- I

feel terrible, hon.

BETTY

It's all right.

SUE ANN

You sure?  Maybe next week we could...

BETTY

Uh-huh.  No, we'll do it later.  'S only

a birthday, right?  I'll have another one

next year...

SUE ANN

Aahhh...

(BEAT)

So what color is it?

15.

BETTY

What?

SUE ANN

The LeSabre!

BETTY

Maroon.

(BEAT)

I stole it.

SUE ANN

What?

BETTY

He wasn't going to let us use it, so I

just took it.

SUE ANN

Oh, I wish we could just get in it and

drive, and drive, and drive!

BETTY

Yeah, me too.

SUE ANN

Sorry, hon.  Happy Birthday...

BETTY

I gotta go make dinner.

17     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY                                17

BETTY

Sure you don't want any salad?

DEL

No, I do not want any goddamn... what was

all that shit on the phone about the new

Buicks?

16.

BETTY

I told you.  Sue Ann was gonna take me

out tonight, but...

DEL

She's not comfortable in a Corsica?  'S

got air and leather...

BETTY

I took the blue Corsica, Del.  Relax.

DEL

All right, then.  Actually, I'm glad

you're going out.  I got something going

on tonight.  Some serious clients, with

real potential.

BETTY

... like the water purifiers?

DEL

What?

BETTY

Or the vitamins?  Or the...?

DEL

Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they

changed the law, and you know it!

(BEAT)

Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some

dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress,

what do you got?

BETTY

I got you, Del...

DEL

... well, then you ain't got much.

BETTY

Oh, I know.

(BEAT)

So, who're these clients?

DEL

Couple 'a guys in from outta town.  They

want to see the new LeSabres.

17.

DEL (cont'd)

And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around

to fuck it up...

BETTY

Just knock it off, 'kay?  Anyhow, they're

97's, they're not even new.

DEL

They're new to us...

DEL (cont'd)

Jesus... you know these actors are mainly

models, which are mainly fags.  They've

done studies.  The rest're assholes.  But

you know what bugs me most about these

soaps?

DEL (cont'd)

It's people with no lives watching other

people's fake lives.

BETTY

Yeah, I guess there's nothing like

watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?

DEL

That is a skill!

DEL (cont'd)

Daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.

(to Betty)

Be back later... clean up.

BETTY

What the hell am I doing?

18.

18     INT. LONNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)          18

LONNIE

Tell me something good, Sugar.

19     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)           19

CHLOE

We're all set.  I told him my car's in

the shop.  He said he'd be happy to give

me a ride home.

LONNIE

(V.O.)

You're beautiful.

CHLOE

Tell me something I don't know...

20     INT. WOODED ROADSIDE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)             20

CHLOE

Thanks for pulling over, David... I can't

go that fast without taking a breather.

DAVID

Sorry... it's nice to see what this

little beauty can do, though.  I guess,

somehow, all that speed helps me forget

the past...

19.

CHLOE

I'm sure it does...

(touching the seats)

Mmm, leather.  How far do they recline?

CHLOE (cont'd)

Listen, David, I know I've said it

before, but I want to tell you again how

sorry I am about your wife.

(BEAT)

It must make you scared to get close to

someone again.

CHLOE (cont'd)

Let's not go... not yet.

BETTY

Damn!

21     EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              21

22     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              22

DEL

... you can have the best damn running

backs in the world, somebody's still

gotta block for 'em.

20.

CHARLIE

You're a hundred percent right.  They

rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...

23     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        23

DEL  (O.S.)

My apologies, gentlemen.  I asked my wife

to straighten this shit up before she

went out.

23A     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               23A

DEL

Now, what can I get you gentlemen to

drink?

CHARLIE

Bourbon, little water, thank you.

WESLEY

Beer, please.

DEL

You got it.

WESLEY

Hey... you got a fine one right here!

CHARLIE

Wesley...

(to Del)

Your wife's a very lovely woman.  Have I

seen her before?

21.

DEL

If you ate at the Tip Top you did.

CHARLIE

Oh, yes, with the coffee...

DEL

Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.

CHARLIE

I like this.  I like doing business in

the home. It's cozy...

(noticing the card and cupcake)

Who's birthday?

DEL

Ahh... my wife's.

WESLEY

What'd you get her?

DEL

Huh?  Oh, umm, a car.

(BEAT)

So, to a successful transaction...

24     INT. DAVID'S CAR - WOODED ROADSIDE - (ON TV SCREEN)     24

DAVID

I'm sorry, Chloe.

DAVID (cont'd)

It's not that I don't find you

attractive.  I'm just not ready...

22.

25     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                25

DEL

All right gentlemen, let's get down to

it.  I need to know if you're for real.

CHARLIE

If we're for real?

DEL

You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

WESLEY

Isn't that the point?

DEL

Yeah, well,  I don't have time to screw

around.  I got buyers in Dallas, Houston

and Vegas who are ready to snap this

stuff up.

CHARLIE

We appreciate that.  But you just poured

me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your

hospitality for a few minutes.

DEL

Fine.  You got five...

CHARLIE

It's a nice place you got here.  Real

comfortable.  Sweet little town, Fair

Oaks.  You like it here?

DEL

(laughs)

Are you kidding me?  What's to like?

WESLEY

Seems like a nice place.

DEL

It is, if you like idiots...

CHARLIE

What do you mean?

DEL

It's a small town, man.  I never should

have left Omaha.  People here think

23.

small.  They act small.  They're a bunch

of dumb fucks.

WESLEY

Really?

DEL

You better believe it.

CHARLIE

Could you give us an example?

DEL

Of what?

CHARLIE

I'm asking you for an example of one of

these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

DEL

I don't follow...

CHARLIE

You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?

DEL

(warily)

No...

CHARLIE

I didn't think so.  So, give me an

example of a stupid person doing a stupid

thing.  Not being stupid, you're equipped

to recognize it.

DEL

Are we gonna do business here, or not?

WESLEY

Relax, we brought the cash.

CHARLIE

I'm just curious.  Can't you give me an

example?

DEL

(annoyed)

All right ... lemme see ... okay, new

Burger King opens up.  These assholes get

excited and start lining up.  Like it's

some five star restaurant.  The place is

mobbed.  Right?

24.

CHARLIE

Hmmmm.  "Five Stars," huh?

(BEAT)

Is that stupid, Wesley?

WESLEY

No, that's ignorant.  They just don't

know any better.

CHARLIE

That's what I thought.

(to Del)

You better give me another example.

DEL

This is bullshit, can we get down to

business here, please?

DEL (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ!

WESLEY

He's waiting...

DEL

Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.

WESLEY

"Injuns?"

CHARLIE

You did not just say "Injuns," Del.

DEL

The Indians, Injuns, whatever.  They're

always drunk and doing stupid things.

CHARLIE

Like what?

DEL

Driving their cars into trees... puking

on the sidewalk... stupid shit!

CHARLIE

Let's see... around here that would be

Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not

mistaken.

DEL

I... I don't know...

25.

CHARLIE

Well, my idea of stupid is very different

from yours.

(BEAT)

So here's how this is gonna work.  Would

you take your socks off, please?

DEL

My socks?

WESLEY

You heard the man.

CHARLIE

I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm

finished, you can answer.  But I don't

like being interrupted.  Now roll them

into a ball...

DEL

Oh, Jesus, please...  Please, God.

CHARLIE

... and put them in your mouth.

26     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        26

DAVID

(V.O.)

You're wonderful, Chloe, you are... But I

just know there's something special out

there for me.

27     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                27

CHARLIE

Now I'm gonna tell you what stupid is.

Stupid is taking something that doesn't

belong to you.  Right Wesley?

26.

WESLEY

That's right.

CHARLIE

Stupid is trying to sell it to other

people who are, by their very nature,

untrustworthy.

WESLEY

That is so right.

CHARLIE

Stupid is calling people in Kansas City

who are affiliated with the rightful

owners of the thing you stole, and trying

to sell it to them.  Right Wesley?

WESLEY

Now, that's really stupid.

CHARLIE

So you see, we have totally different

ideas of what's stupid and what's not.

Don't we?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Good.  Now we're getting somewhere.  You

agree that you were stupid?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

You know, a hundred and fifty years ago

you'd have been scalped for that remark

about Native Americans.  Right here where

your house is - you'd have been scalped.

WESLEY

Hell of a way to die.

CHARLIE

It wasn't always fatal, Wesley.  We could

scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty

alive to tell us how it feels.

CHARLIE  (CONT'D)

It's pretty simple, too.

(BEAT)

27.

First you take a knife and just draw a

mark right across the hairline.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Hold still, Del, we're just talking

here...

(pointing to a spot)

Then you grab a big handful of hair and

pull as you cut.  It's amazing how easily

the scalp comes off.

WESLEY

A mark, huh?

WESLEY (cont'd)

Shut the fuck up!  I bleed more than that

when I shave...

CHARLIE

Now.  I want to know the particulars of

your stupid act:  how you got what

doesn't belong to you, who helped you get

it, and of course, where it is now.

DEL

It's in the Buick!  I swear to God it's

all there!

28     INT. BLAKE DANIELS' OFFICE - DAY  (ON TV SCREEN)        28

DAVID

You wanted to see me, Blake?

BLAKE

I wish I could say I had good news.

(off David's look)

David, I'll get right to the point.

Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual

28.

assault against you.

(BEAT)

You can continue to practice at L.A.

County, but I'm afraid I have to revoke

your privileges here at Loma Vista until

this is resolved.

DEL  (O.S.)

PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!

29     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                29

DEL

I got it from a truck driver named Duane

Cooley, out of Amarillo.  He brings my

cars down from Detroit.  But I haven't

touched it, I swear to you... Please!

Please!  Please!

CHARLIE

Consider yourself lucky.  Luckier than

those 'Injuns' you have such contempt

for.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal

it's the American Indian.  This country

has a black mark on its soul for what was

done to them.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

I'm all for them owning casinos, getting

rich off the white man's greed.  It's a

beautiful piece of irony, isn't it,

Wesley?

29.

WESLEY

IT SURE IS!!

CHARLIE

JESUS CHRIST!!!

CHARLIE (cont'd)

(to Wesley)

What the fuck is the matter with you?!

30     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        30

31     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                31

CHARLIE

Are you out of your mind?  You scalped

him!

30.

WESLEY

You told me how to do it!

CHARLIE

That was to get him to talk!

(BEAT)

Get rid of that thing, will you?

CHARLIE  (CONT'D)

This is great - just great!  Now we don't

know where the goddamn stuff is.

WESLEY

He told us it's in the Buick.

CHARLIE

We don't know which Buick, do we?

WESLEY

Well, why'd you shoot him?

CHARLIE

I had to shoot him!  It was the only

decent thing to do.

CHARLIE  (O.S.) (cont'd)

This is very unprofessional, Wesley.

Happy Birthday to you!  Happy Birthday to

But I just know there's something special

out there for me.

Hang on there, Roy.  Nobody comes in.

ROY

Elden called me.  He wants to, ahh, make

a statement for the paper...

36     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - SEWING ROOM - SAME TIME            36

ROY

Hey, Betty.  Are you okay?

BETTY

I'm great, good, content.

(stopping)

What happened to your arm, Roy?

ROY

Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to

keep it wrapped for a few...

32.

BETTY

Make sure it's elevated...

ROY

Uh-huh.

BETTY

You want me to make you a sling? It's no

problem...

BETTY (cont'd)

What're you doing here, Roy?

ROY

Well, I was worried about you and I

wanted to make sure you were alright...

and I guess I was sort of hoping I could

ask you about what happened...

BETTY

Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing.

It was disgusting!

ROY

My God... did you get a look at who did

it?

BETTY

Yes.

ROY

You did?  Was it anyone that you...?

BETTY

It was Chloe...

BALLARD

Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping

directly in the evidence, please?

(to Roy)

Ostrey, you and your goddamn police

scanner! I leave for ten minutes and...

Betty, I'm sorry about this.

33.

BALLARD (cont'd)

Why don't you take her down to the

station? We'll be along in a bit...

BETTY

'Night, guys...

37     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                37

BALLARD

Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the

record yet.

ROY

Oww! My arm, careful!

BALLARD

Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your

bike again?

ROY

No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just

mauled me a little when I layed their

food out.

BALLARD

Good God...they're meat eaters, Roy, just

drop the shit in there!

ROY

I can't...they prefer a more formal

presentation. I don't usually go so close

to the surface, but I was...

BALLARD

...you are so goddamn weird.

(BEAT)

Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta

here!

ROY

No, Elden, I need to...

BALLARD

You need to get yourself gone from my

crime scene. And leave Betty alone,

she's...

34.

ROY

She knows who killed Del.  Elden, she

said it was a woman.

BALLARD

It wasn't a woman.

ROY

Yes it was.  Betty saw the whole thing!

Your killer's name is Chloe...

BALLARD

I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!

38     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                38

BALLARD

Kinda' looks like a burnt out roman

candle, don't he?

(BEAT)

Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong

Indian, and got paid back the old

fashioned way.  Them Kickapoos get pretty

mean when they drink...

ROY

So, you think you're gonna find his scalp

hanging in some tepee?

BALLARD

They no longer live in tepees, Mr.

College Graduate.

35.

ROY

Did you send anyone out there?

BALLARD

You bet I did.  I got a squad car on the

way to the reservation right now.

ROY

Bad idea ...

BALLARD

You just go write your little story, Roy.

I'll handle the police work...

ROY

You better handle what's in this garbage

can first.

WESLEY

I still don't understand how you knew Del

was telling the truth.

CHARLIE

I saw his soul Wesley.  He was face to

face with his God, and no one lies in

that situation.  But your Geronimo act

rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.

(BEAT)

Never abandon you instincts.

WESLEY

I didn't.  You gave me a look!

CHARLIE

What 'look'?

WESLEY

That one look you got!  I thought you

were done, so I took him out...

CHARLIE

I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing

him whine.  And you didn't take him out,

you scalped him.  Christ, I almost puked,

did I tell you that?

WESLEY

Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian

story?

36.

CHARLIE

What the hell does that mean?  If I'd

told a Ty Cobb story would you have

clubbed him to death with a bat?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

It's not here.  Let's go.

WESLEY

You just gonna leave these cars sitting

here like this?

CHARLIE

Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do

something, now that you fucked it up.

WESLEY

I wanted to make a statement.

CHARLIE

Let me tell you something.  In our

business you can't put food on the table

if your phone doesn't ring.  The guys who

get the calls are good - not flashy, just

good.  They get in, they get out.  Nobody

knows a goddamn thing.  Understand?

Boom, boom, boom.  Three in the head and

you know they're dead.

WESLEY

... that's a good motto.

CHARLIE

Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but

you better start believing it!  It's the

only statement you need to make.

41     INT. POLICE STATION / OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT          41

DOCTOR

And did your husband know these people?

BETTY

Sort of...but he ignored them.

DOCTOR

And how did that make you feel, Betty?

37.

BETTY

I felt all cold inside.  And angry.

BALLARD

I questioned Joyce about all this...

ROY

Yeah?

BALLARD

Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol

Del. On a regular basis, if you get my

drift...

ROY

... and half the other guys in this town.

Including you, I believe...

BALLARD

Junior year!

ROY

Anyway, so what?

BALLARD

So? ... Suppose Betty found out about

them?

ROY

You said a woman couldn't have done it.

BALLARD

A woman can write a check.

ROY

So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our

Betty Sizemore--who you were in swing

choir with--has now hired somebody to

scalp her husband in her own kitchen

while she watched?  You're amazing.

BALLARD

'S just a theory...just 'cause I'm

thinking it don't mean I like it.

BALLARD (cont'd)

How is she?

38.

DOCTOR

She's in a kind of shock. I see all the

signs of a post-traumatic reaction with

possible dissociative symptoms.

BALLARD

Could I have that in American?

DOCTOR

It's a type of altered state...it allows

a traumatized person to continue

functioning.

BALLARD

So she did witness it?

ROY

Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.

BALLARD

That's it!  YOU'RE GONE!

ROY

Oww, the arm, the arm!

BALLARD

You just don't know when to quit, Roy!

You were jealous of me when I got hall

monitor in seventh grade, and you're

still jealous now!!!

ROY

One question, Doctor, please! (outside

the door) You can't do this! I'm the

press, I have rights!!

BALLARD

That's right, you have the right to

remain silent.

BALLARD (cont'd)

Sorry you had to see that. You were

saying?

DOCTOR

I was saying that it seems probable that

she witnessed the murder, but her memory

of it is gone, at least for the time

being. I also think you ought to have her

39.

stay with someone tonight.

(BEAT)

Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?

BALLARD

No... Friends from the diner maybe?

DOCTOR

Well, you should find out.  She keeps

talking about them...

BETTY

Are you and Larry happy?

SUE ANN

Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

BETTY

Then you should treasure that... you

gotta hold on to whatever you got that's

any good, even if it's only a little bit.

SUE ANN

All you been through... I ever tell you

what a good friend you are?

BETTY

All the time...

SUE ANN

Well, you are.

40.

BETTY

Something bad happened to Del and me,

didn't it?

SUE ANN

Yeah, hon.  Real bad.  You just get some

sleep, everything's gonna be fine.

BETTY

Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I

just know there's something special out

there for me...

44     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              44

This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't

been happy for a long time. You always say people

need their space, and now you'll have some.  I'm

sorry.

Sure, I got Asian.  Got black, white, any

color you like, video and magazine.  Got

fat chicks and animals too, if you want

'em.  They're extra...

CHARLIE

Mmmm.  Well, it was a piece of luck

running into you, Duane. I thought I was

42.

gonna have to take Wesley out and hose

him down.  All he talks about is those

Japanese gals.

WESLEY

I like 'em small.  When you're inside a

little Asian chick, it's like your dick

is the axle that holds her body together.

DUANE

That's nicely put.  You outta get

yourself to Thailand...

DUANE

Georgia.  In case I didn't tell you, it's

cash only, gentlemen.

WESLEY

We can live with that.

CHARLIE

I'm a Yankee, myself.  Massachusetts.

DUANE

Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized

Zone. Get it?

(laughs)

They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.

CHARLIE

You know, it's interesting.  The South

lost the Civil War, but they still seem

to get all the glory.

DUANE

Huh?

43.

CHARLIE

Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson

Davis - they're all losers in my book.

DUANE

The fuck you talking about?

CHARLIE

Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

DUANE

(to Wesley)

He goin' crazy on us, or what?

CHARLIE

Did you know the most brutal, inhumane

prison of the entire war was in Georgia?

DUANE

Really.  And where was that, old man?

something, sweetheart.  You're in this up

CHARLIE

... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport

you noticed that two guys were slipping

something extra in one of your cars, and

you decided to see what it was.  Then you

figured you'd take this valuable

commodity and go into business yourself,

even though it didn't belong to you.  But

you needed a crackerjack salesman to move

it, so you made the biggest mistake of

your short life and chose Del.  Sound

right so far?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Del's dead, by the way.  I sent him to

the Great Beyond.

WESLEY

Actually, I scalped him, and then you

killed him.

CHARLIE

Exactly.

(BEAT)

Now, the one thing I don't get is that we

checked all the Buicks on that lot.  Four

'97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Ohhh ... There weren't four, were there?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

There were five, damn it!  I should have

known!!  Goddamn...

(BEAT)

So, what happened to the fifth car?

45.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

You know you're going to die, don't you,

Duane?

(Duane nods)

And you really don't know where that

other LeSabre is, do you?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

He's telling the truth.  He doesn't know.

WESLEY

Should I kill him now?

CHARLIE

Wait.  Any last words, General Lee?

DUANE

Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.

CHARLIE

God, I admire that.  Ya see that, Wesley?

That's why they get all the glory.

passenger?

Only to say he was wearing green.

What if the killers didn't see her?  You

published her picture - you're gonna get

her killed!

BALLARD

No, we're bringing the community into the

effort to find her.

ROY

You're lying!

BALLARD

I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.

(the reporters hush)

That's right.  There's no doubt in my

mind, folks... she's on the run.  Whether

or not she's mixed up in all this remains

to be seen...

ROY

That's bullshit, Sheriff!  You think

she's a suspect!

I'd like to apologize for our local boy.

He's been in love with Betty since the

fifth grade, y'see.  He means well, but

he's in over his head on this.

This is bad, Wesley.  Very, very bad.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

... extremely bad.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Did you hear what I said?

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of

this situation.  It's bad enough that we

don't have what we came here for.  It's

worse that we don't know where it is. And

now this.

This was supposed to be my last job.  I

already put the deposit down on my boat.

(BEAT)

How can you eat at a time like this?  I

get nauseous just watching you...

WESLEY

I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap

that woman.  I can eat because they

aren't looking for us.  And I can eat

'cause I'm fucking hungry...

(off Charlie's look)

... relax.  She's gonna end up on a milk

carton and that's about it.

CHARLIE

I hope you're right...

WESLEY

... I know I am.  Let's just do what we

gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.

Europe?  The Europe?

(laughs)

This is my first time out of Kansas.

ELLEN

I should call you Dorothy.

(BEAT)

When I left here I went straight to

Italy.  Everybody told me not to go.  But

I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw

Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and

goddamnit, I went.

BETTY

Did you love it?

ELLEN

Sure I loved it!  It was great.

ELLEN (CONT'D)

Let me tell you something.  I got groped

by these Tunisian guys who thought I was

a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter

than stink the whole time, and I got some

kind of weird gum disease from the water.

Plus, it ended my marriage--

BETTY

That's horrible!

ELLEN

No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad

than Merle... I just wear the ring to

keep the flies away.  Rome was the best

thing I ever did, because I DID IT!  And

I swear to you, it changed me.  I've been

to Rome, Italy!  I sat every morning at

the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino,

and watched the pilgrims walk to mass,

and no one can ever take that away from

me.

BETTY

I left my husband two days ago.

ELLEN

Really?

58.

BETTY

I'm getting back with my ex-fianc.  He

proposed to me right around here, so I

guess this is just sort of a sentimental

stop...

ELLEN

Wait, I thought you said you'd never been

outta Kansas...

BETTY

Oh.  I mean, except for that.

(BEAT)

Yep.  I'm trading in a car dealer for a

heart specialist, so that's pretty

good...

ELLEN

Nice move.  Cedars Sinai?

BETTY

No.  Loma Vista.

ELLEN

(laughs)

I s'pose his name's David Ravell.

BETTY

(truly shocked)

How did you know?

ELLEN

What's his real name?

BETTY

Dr. David Ravell.

ELLEN

You mean... George McCord, the actor?

BETTY

No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

ELLEN

Yeah, I know, we just watched him

together, remember?  Up there on the TV.

(off Betty's earnest look)

Good God Almighty ... You're serious.

I've heard about people like you.

59.

ELLEN (CONT'D)

Piss off, Merle.

(to Betty)

So how you gonna find him, Betty?

BETTY

I'll go to the Hospital.

ELLEN

What if you can't find him?  What if you

get out there, and nothing's the way you

thought it was gonna be?

BETTY

Like Rome?

ELLEN

Worse.

BETTY

You made out alright.

ELLEN

Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna

be there when I arrived...

BETTY

Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've

ever done, but I've gotta do it.

ELLEN

You take care of yourself then, Betty,

and don't let anybody stop you...

BETTY

To tell you the truth, I can't believe

I've made it this far.  It may not be

Europe, but I just know there's something

special out there for me...

MERLE

What planet is she from?

WESLEY

CHARLIE

I'd say that about torches her

credibility, wouldn't you?

WESLEY

Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell

(into phone)

Yes?

CHARLIE

Sorry, you've got the wrong number.

CHARLIE          (CONT'D)

No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic

type.  Ice water in her veins.  A clear

thinker.  Probably a Swede or a Finn.

WESLEY

A 'Finn?'  What is a Finn?

CHARLIE

You should read more.  Listen to me.  I

think this woman was waiting for a chance

to do this, and we gave it to her.  She

kept to herself for years, living with a

pompous asshole.  Then she sees her

opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that

little mudpatch in the dust.  These

heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause

that's not their sweet little Betty.

Hah!  We've been tracking her for, what,

three days and I already understand her

better'n most the people in that shitty

little burg.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Betty, Betty, Betty...

WESLEY

So what the fuck's a Finn?

CHARLIE

Oh, for Chrissakes.  It just means the

kind of person who can eat shit for a

long time without complaining, then cut

their momma's throat and go dancing the

same night.

WESLEY

Like... us?

No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley.

No reason to get a plate dirty.

I see you're sticking to the diet Betty

put you on...

BALLARD

Betty is a big, big fan of the soap

opera, "A Reason to Love." Look...

BALLARD

Why do I need to see this?  Did he ask

you to...?

ROY

Listen!  I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on

T.V.  They're television characters.

SUE ANN

Betty's in love with Dr. David Ravell,

from the show.  What if she's out in Los

Angeles looking for him?  The actor, I

mean...

BALLARD

That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

ROY

Yeah?  Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday

from Arizona.

BALLARD

She said she was in Arizona, did she?

ROY & SUE ANN

Yes!!

BALLARD

You people are even more stupid than I

thought.  The woman's on the run and

she's gonna just phone in her location?

SUE ANN

Come on, Elden, she's not on the run.

Couldn't you at least call the Los

Angeles Police Department?

You gotta do that much.

Very graceful.  Perfect form.

ELIZABETH

Betty was a lovely child.

JERROLD

And she always had such spirit!  But,

after her mother died...

WESLEY

Would you say she was ambitious?

JERROLD

Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl

could've accomplished, and she never had

it easy.  Never really had a childhood...

caring for her father, going to school.

CHARLIE

Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such

poise, too.

(quietly)

Very, very impressive...

WESLEY

Well, then, did you ever get any

indication that she wanted to leave her

husband?

65.

ELIZABETH

I don't like talking bad about the dead,

but now that he's gone I can tell you she

put up with things in that marriage I

wouldn't have.  And yes, she, of all

people, was the one who defended him.

And that's why what that sheriff said

makes me so angry.

CHARLIE

What do you mean?

ELIZABETH

If anyone had paid to have that husband

of hers killed, it would have been me.

CHARLIE

(taking her hand)

Mrs. Blaine?  I can tell you right now,

without a doubt, that your granddaughter

is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

JERROLD

You've got to be missing a piece of your

soul to kill someone. That's not our

Betty...

WESLEY

(defensive)

... why do you think you have to be

missing a piece of your soul to kill

somebody?

JERROLD

Because it ain't natural, young man.

WESLEY

What are you talking about?  Killing's

totally natural.  It's dying that isn't

natural...

CHARLIE

My partner's still young, Mr. Blaine, and

he loves his job.

(Off Chief Nurse's look)

It's not true.  He was set up.

Well, I certainly would have heard about

that.

BETTY

Of course, he's only here two days a

believe was mixed up with the Mafia...

Fuck the details, they're always to

blame...  Look, too many of these guys

duck out on us, especially after they

become doctors or lawyers.  I see it at

WESLEY (cont'd)

They found her in Vegas.

WESLEY (cont'd)

Perfect match on the description.

84.

WESLEY (O.S.)

(CONT'D)

Sounds like she's with the buyer Del

lined up.

CHARLIE

How'd they describe her?

WESLEY

You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

CHARLIE

Not so fast!  Slower... 'blonde, thin',

yes... Did they say she had style?  A

kind of grace or anything?

WESLEY

(to mechanic)

How do I get this fucking thing down?

MECHANIC

I wouldn't if I were you.  He got pretty

upset when I tried it...

What do you think my father would do if I

told him I didn't want to be a lawyer

anymore?

ROSA

Probably the same thing my mom would do

if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

MERCEDES

So how's it going with your new roomie?

What's her name?

ROSA

Betty.  It's O.K. except I'm worn out.

We spent all weekend looking for her

85.

doctor-boy.  How can a big time heart guy

leave no trace of himself?

MERCEDES

So tell her to settle for the old one in

Orange County.

ROSA

She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of

ideas.

MERCEDES

Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.

What's his name again?

ROSA

David Ravell.

MERCEDES

God, that sounds so familiar.  Ravell,

Ravell... where's he out of?

ROSA

I'm not sure now.  She said he used to be

over at Loma Vista.  I never heard of it.

MERCEDES

Loma Vista?

(laughs)

You mean like the guy on "A Reason to

Love?"

ROSA

Doctor David Ravell.

BETTY

What?  Where was he?!

ROSA

ON TELEVISION!!

(off Betty's puzzled look)

Cut the shit, will you!

ROSA (CONT'D)

Either you're making a fool out of me

because you get off on it, or you got

serious problems.  Which one is it?!

BETTY

I have no idea what you're talking about.

ROSA

I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!

BETTY

Shhh!  I heard you the first time.

ROSA

(suddenly calm)

I spent my weekend looking for someone

who does - not - exist.  I should have

been here at the hospital with my

brother, but I was with you.

BETTY

If you didn't want to do it, you should

have said so!  Is this about gas money?

ROSA

IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!

(BEAT)

You have a thing for an actor on a stupid

white soap opera, and we searched all

over town for his character!  Not the

actor - whose name is George, by the way.

His character!

BETTY

Are you having a nervous breakdown?

87.

BETTY (cont'd)

Why'd you help me in the first place?

ROSA

I helped you because I'm an idiot!  Ask

my mother, I love it when people take

advantage of me!  I TRUSTED YOU!! I

THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!

BETTY

HE IS REAL!!

ROSA

You need help, Betty! Even if this is

your idea of a joke, you need SERIOUS

HELP!!

(walking away - to herself)

Necesitas un mdico! Pront simo!

ROSA (cont'd)

I'm not going back on our arrangement. My

word is good, and my family owes you. But

I think it's best for both of us if you

get your own place as soon as you can.

Fine.

JOYCE

Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead,

Betty's gone.  She's probably dead, too.

You'd like that wouldn't you?  You've

hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad

JOYCE

No... before that.

Ahh, I hate this town!  Places like this

What did you say?

The driver was killed. I think there's a

connection--

JOYCE

No, about... Are you talking about Duane

Cooley?

ROY (O.S.)

Yeah.  Why, you know him?

JOYCE

No.

WESLEY

No... be dark before we get there.  You

wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?

CHARLIE

What difference does it make?  She wasn't

in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We

92.

went to every goddamn place Del mentioned

and no Betty.  So what the hell makes you

think she's in Vegas?  You think she's

waiting for us with tassles on her

Do I know you from...?

BETTY

...of course you do.

(hurt)

You don't remember me?

GEORGE

I take it I should.  I'm sorry.

BETTY

We were engaged.

LYLA

Oh good, another one...

GEORGE

I beg your pardon?

BETTY

But I'm the one who's sorry.  Letting you

go was the biggest mistake of my life.

(to his friends)

We were thirteen days away from getting

married and ... I just got scared. It's a

mistake I've had to live with for six

years.  But it's behind me now...

(to George)

And I hope you can put it behind you.

I've missed you... David.

GEORGE

That's very kind of you.

BETTY

The day I left you I just drove and

drove.  I drove all day and all that

night, and I didn't go anywhere.  I just

kept driving.  I stopped at a little

country church, and the pastor let me in,

and I sat--

LYLA

... in the very first pew, where we would

have sat on our wedding day.

95.

LYLA (cont'd)

I can't believe I remembered that,

although I suppose I should.  I wrote

it...

(to Betty)

But that was seven years ago, and you're

quoting it verbatim.  I'm flattered... I

think.  Or frightened.   What's your

name?

BETTY

Betty Sizemore.  What do you mean you

wrote it?

LYLA

I'm Lyla Branch.  I'm the Producer.

LYLA (cont'd)

Alright, I admit it, you had me there.

You're better than most of them,

anyway...do you have a headshot?

GEORGE

No, wait...what happened next, Betty?

LYLA

Are you sure you want to encourage this?

(BEAT)

No, you're right, let's have some fun.

So, what did happened next, "Betty"?

BETTY

Well, David moved out here and started

his residency.  Then he met Leslie--

LYLA

No, no, no.  We know all that.  What

happened with you?

BETTY

I married a car salesman.

FRIEND #1

You were dumped for a car salesman,

George!

BETTY

Why are you calling him George?

96.

FRIEND #2

Yeah - David - tell us about this car

salesman.

GEORGE

Oh, you mean Fred.

BETTY

No, Del.

GEORGE

Right, Del.  Del was one hot salesman.

Of cars.  He could talk anyone into

anything.

BETTY

You knew Del?!

GEORGE

Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the

time, but Del and I go way back.  We went

to school together.  In fact, he saved my

life.  Two more minutes in that icy water

and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped

in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch

eventually, but I still owe him one.

BETTY

He never told me anything about...that's

unbelievable!

LYLA

Funny, that's just what I was thinking...

GEORGE

I can't tell you how much it hurts me to

hear that you married him.

BETTY

I'm so sorry.  Life makes us do awful

things sometimes.

GEORGE

I tried to tell myself it was for the

best, that there was a reason behind it.

But... Del?

97.

BETTY

There was no plan!  I was just young and

stupid and scared!

GEORGE

You never gave us a chance...

BETTY

I know that.  I can't tell you how many

times I've said that to myself in those

exact words.

GEORGE

Hey, don't... come on, I was just...

you're not really crying, are you?...  I

was just playing along...

FRIEND #1

Now, look what you've done, George.

BETTY

Why do they keep calling you George?

GEORGE

I don't know.  Why do you keep calling me

George?

LYLA

Listen - David - It's getting late.

GEORGE

(to Betty)

Right, uhh...I feel terrible about this,

we have a prior engagement at another

party.

(BEAT)

But... I'd be honored if you'd come.

LYLA

Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure

you got a lot of catching up to do...

popular...

FRIEND #1

I never bought a car from Del.  But I

loved him.  In my own way.

I guess we all did. (to Betty) You know,

I didn't marry Leslie because I loved

her.  I married her to forget you...

neither has Merle.  He drinks too much.

And don't try to tell me you're cops.  I

102.

was married to a cop for nine years, and

you're not cops.  Now get out of here.

CHARLIE

You haven't been very forthcoming with

liked me.

She's a good person to know.

(BEAT)

So where did you study again?

BETTY

Carleton School of Nursing.  Two

semesters, but Del made me give it up...

GEORGE

Alright, okay... I think you broke the

record for staying in character about

three hours ago.

BETTY

You told me that two hours ago.

BETTY (cont'd)

I haven't been this happy since I was

twelve years old.

GEORGE

What happened when you were twelve?

BETTY

For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance

that I'd been saving to take my mother to

Kansas City.  We got our nails done and

had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the

top of a building from where you can see

the whole city.  It was the last outing

we took together.  She died the following

year.

GEORGE

Wow ... You just gave me goosebumps, you

know that?  You make it all sound so

real.  Great improv...

BETTY

I just want everything to be perfect

between us.

I know. Listen, we need to take a time

out here.  Can we talk seriously for a

minute?

BETTY

Of course.

At last!  I know how much you want this.

You're gifted and extremely determined,

but ... it's not up to me.

know...

No, I'm not sure I could begin to

imagine... So, where'd you go?

Was it a huge place?  With a view of the

whole world?

BETTY

Yes.  I'd never been in a place like that

before.

I have, lots of times.  My mother used to

pools.

This isn't fair, you know.  Do you always

get what you want?

No, almost never.

as I shave here.  So, first thing we...

Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't

make sense.

What doesn't?

You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends

theory, you believe that dumbshit

trucker, you believe this woman...

WESLEY

No, you believed her, we drove all the

that much... so why's the rest of her

story suddenly so kooky?  Huh?

instinct.  Call it 35 years of

professional know-how...

BETTY

Are you sure I can borrow this?

ROSA

No, please.  Go ahead, it's your

funeral...

BETTY

Rosa...

ROSA

Well, what if this guy's just playing

with you?  What if he's lying about who

he is?

BETTY

You should have a little faith in people.

ROSA

Does he ever talk about medicine?  His

patients, the hospital?

BETTY

All the time.  It's always "Loma Vista"

this, "Loma Vista" that.

112.

GEORGE

You must be Rosa.  I've heard so much

about you...  I'm George McCord.

ROSA

Not as much as I've heard about you.

She's a very nice girl and you better not

hurt her.

GEORGE

What?

BETTY

Rosa, so you've met David?

ROSA

Sure did!  And a funny thing, Betty, he

introduced himself to me as George!

BETTY

Oh, he does that.

(hugging him)

It's this silly game he plays.  Half the

people who know him call him George.

GEORGE

I don't think your friend likes me.

BETTY

She's a little jealous, I think.  And

confused when it comes to men...

(BEAT)

So where are we going?

GEORGE

Well, first I thought Patina, and then

the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere

a little more romantic.  Like my place.

127     INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                            127

GEORGE

God, I haven't felt like this since I was

with Stella Adler in New York.  You're

so...real.

113.

BETTY

You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.

GEORGE

Didn't I?

BETTY

No, I would have remembered that name.

The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.

(BEAT)

Was this before Leslie?  Before us?...

GEORGE

I've never met anyone like you, Betty.

BETTY

I know, that's why we were meant to be

together...

GEORGE

No, I mean your dedication scares me...

BETTY

It's easy to be dedicated, when you care

about something...

GEORGE

Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first

started, but now... the hours, the

repetition... it's not all glamour and

mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've

listened to my people and tried to make

the crossover to nights earlier, I don't

know...

(BEAT)

...I just hope it's not too late for me.

God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so

easy to get caught up in the whole ego

cycle of this business and make it all

about yourself. Stop, right? That's it,

no more about me tonight, I promise...

Let's talk about you...what do you think

about me? I'm kidding... Seriously,

Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...

BETTY

...but I love listening to you, so that's

okay...

114.

GEORGE

Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're

feeling...

BETTY

Well, I just feel that life'll be much

sweeter for you now with me around.  I

promise...

GEORGE

You know, I almost believe that... you're

like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown

into my life...

(laughs)

I said that to Leslie, once, at her

funeral, remember?...

BETTY

I remember.  You said it to her, but it

was meant for me, wasn't it?

GEORGE

Yes... maybe it was.

WESLEY

...so I'm standing there, minding my own

business on Hollywood Blvd., checking out

Gladys Knight's star-thing there, I look

up at this little souvenir shop dude,

Chinese dude, reading a paper... and who

do I see?

(holding up paper)

That's Lonnie.  He's the show's Main

Prick.  And that is definitely Betty.

Now, that ain't no coincidence...

(BEAT)

I found out where they shoot it, and

where the dressing rooms are.

CHARLIE

Who's this?

WESLEY

A doctor on the show... why?

WESLEY (cont'd)

What in the...

What the hell is this?  You've been

holding out on me.  All this fucking

CHARLIE

It just didn't fit her profile...

WESLEY

Fuck the profile!  That's the same guy!!

CHARLIE

She can't be here because of a... a soap

opera.  Not a soap opera.  That'd make

her...

WESLEY

... crazy!  No shit, Shaft!!  And you

ain't far behind...

CHARLIE

... but she's, no, Betty's smarter than

that.  She wouldn't be here for a...

WESLEY

I do not know how the fuck you lasted an

hour in this job!  Dragging our asses

around with the answer to our prayers in

your motherfucking jacket... a picture of

that cunt right next to the...

CHARLIE

Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like

that.  I don't care who she ends up

being, you never use that word again.

Got it?

WESLEY

Man, you have got to get some therapy.

CHARLIE

I said 'got it?'

116.

WESLEY

... yeah, I got it.

Surprise!

BETTY

Oh my gosh...I didn't know I was going to

meet your friends today...I dressed a

little casual.

117.

GEORGE

That's cute...listen, you got the part,

and I'm directing.  You've only got four

lines today, so I thought I'd just spring

it on you.  No blocking or anything, just

stand near the nurse's station... we're

gonna do a quick walk-through.  Alright?

Traffic was terrible...

No, that's fine, we've only got seventy

We'll get you into hair and make-up after

this, just put this on...

CHLOE

Hi.  I hear you're great.  Good luck...

BETTY

What are you doing here?  David...

GEORGE

Your lines'll are in the script, but you

can ad lib.

BETTY

Ad lib?

118.

GEORGE

In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the

magic I'm after.  I wanna give a whole

new feel to the show.

Slate it!

Just do what you've been doing.  Watch

the scene and on your cue take off from

Betty?

Are you all right?

BLAKE

I think you stepped on my first line...

CHLOE

Do you need anything...?

GEORGE

Betty, I thought this would be the best

way.  You know, throw you into it...

LYLA

What the hell's going on?

GEORGE

If you need a minute, that's okay. But I

thought you'd want to--

119.

BETTY

David, I don't...  Can we talk privately

for a second?

GEORGE

Stop calling me David.  We're on set, for

Christ's sake, you don't have to call me

David here.

BETTY

Why are you doing this to me?

GEORGE

Why am I doing this to you?  Isn't this

what you wanted?

LYLA

Is there a problem, George?

GEORGE

No!  No problem, there is no...

(to Betty, sotto)

What is the problem?  Just do that...

thing... you do!  Come on!  You drove me

nuts with this for three days, now do it!

LYLA

All right, everybody!  That's ten

minutes!

GEORGE

No!  Let me try this!

JASMINE

(storming off)

This is bullshit!

LYLA

Forget it, George.  It was a gamble, it

didn't work.  Nice try.

GEORGE

Let me try this, goddamnit!  SHE'S BEEN

DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!

LYLA

I SAID FORGET IT!

120.

GEORGE

Well, I don't know what you had in mind,

but I hope you're happy.  I put myself on

the line for you, my reputation, and

you're making me look like an idiot.

BETTY

What do you mean?  What did I do to

you...

GEORGE

Who put you up to this?  Did my ex-wife

ask you to...?

BETTY

David, please--

GEORGE

STOP CALLING ME THAT!  MY NAME IS NOT

DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE

DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I

THOUGHT YOU WERE!

STAGEHAND

Leave her alone, George!

GEORGE

SHUT THE FUCK UP!! You're a fucking grip,

go grip something!!!

And you're not an actress, you're nothing

but a soap opera groupie, aren't you?

YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO!  DO YOU??

Well, why don't you get a fucking life,

McCord?!

Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she

is!

CHARLIE

How do you do, Mr. McCord.  We're trying

to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a

Ms. Betty...

GEORGE

Deranged.  That would be the right word.

GEORGE (cont'd)

That won't be necessary.  She's staying

with a Rosa something... Hernandez,

Herrera.  I know it's an 'H' sound... in

Silverlake.

CHARLIE

Thanks so much.  You must get bothered by

this kind of thing a lot.

GEORGE

More than you know.  Is there anything

else?

CHARLIE

No, that should be more than--

GEORGE

Good.

Actually, there is one more thing.

It's just... well... I watch the show

too, and you being Dr. Ravell and all, I

thought you could maybe get Jasmine to

come out here.

You thought wrong.

WESLEY

It's just for an autograph.  It's not for

me...

It never is.

You're not on that soap opera thing

again, are you?  'Cause you know what

that is?

BETTY

It's people with no lives watching other

people's fake lives.

DEL

That's right.  So, if you know it, why

are you in trouble?

124.

BETTY

I don't know.

DEL

You sure don't.  Who do you think you are

coming to Hollywood, anyway?  You should

remember where you came from. And who you

really are.

I gotta run.  Got some serious clients to

meet, with real potential.

I have to leave now.

What?  No, I'm not gonna let you just run

what's going on...

You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't

know the half of it.  My husband was,

Yes, I had a husband and he was killed

two weeks ago in my kitchen.  I was right

there...

it?

Yeah, but your running away isn't going

Well, you were right about what that

bartender said.

But you were right first.  You gotta

follow your instincts.

CHARLIE

What do your instincts tell you to do

now, kid?

WESLEY

Leave.  Take this shit back to Detroit

and get the rest of our money.

CHARLIE

We could do that.  I could be on my way

to Florida, and you could go to Thailand

and fuck your brains out.

WESLEY

...but that's not what we're gonna do, is

it?

CHARLIE

No... if we don't finish this job, how

are we gonna look at ourselves in the

mirror?  This is it for me, Wesley, she's

the last one.  My instinct says I gotta

see this through with her, and if there's

one thing I've tried to teach you here--

WESLEY

It's to follow my instincts.  And my

instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.

No, I said to follow 'my' instincts.

C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some

questions for you about...

Have you checked the trunk of that car

you're driving, Betty?  I think there

might be...

BETTY

It's not really a good time, guys...

Don't give me that.  I've come two

thousand miles for this!

Two thousand miles?  That's nothing!

travelled the fucking country to be here!

Do you know why I'm here?

I've got a pretty good idea. You're here

to kill me, so kill me.  You want me to

be afraid, but I'm not.  I don't care who

you are, or why you two killed my

husband...

CHARLIE

You really... didn't have anything to do

with what Del was doing, did you?

132.

BETTY

I have no idea what he was mixed up in...

it was always something.

CHARLIE

So you weren't involved with him in his

pathetic attempt to diversify?

(off her blank look)

Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?

BETTY

Drugs?  God, no!  I'm totally against

drugs.

Damn, life is strange.  I had you figured

for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch--

trade any part of themselves for a few

more minutes of their rotten lives.  But

you... you're different.

BETTY

I am?

CHARLIE

Sure. You could probably have any thing

you wanted... somebody as beautiful and

stylish as yourself, and you don't even

realize it.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

I'm appreciably older than you, but my

health is good.  I take care of myself,

and I got some money socked away.  You'd

never have to work agin, that's for sure.

I'd treat you like a queen.

BETTY

Umm, I don't think that...

CHARLIE

Wait.  Let me get this out.

(clears his throat)

I like the symphony, walks in the rain,

sunsets, animals and children.  I read

passionately, and I like to discuss

things.  I'm basically conservative, but

flexible.  I've been involved in the

death of thirty-two people, but I can

live with that because the world is

lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit,

excuse my language.

BETTY

"Thirty-two?"

CHARLIE

Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting

Del, on account of you... so, what do you

think?

You probably feel I'm flattering myself

to see us together.

BETTY

I don't feel that, no. I just....I'm not

really who you think I am.

CHARLIE

No one is, honey.  Here, listen to

this...  "If who I am and who I hope to

be should meet one day, I know they will

be friends."  Now that's beautiful.

BETTY

I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd

you get that?!

I know.  I borrowed it from your

grandparents because I... I... it doesn't

matter.  Don't worry, they're fine...

practically those same words, sitting at

night in a foxhole in Korea...

wasted all your bullets so you crawl out

there.

Goddammit...

CHARLIE

If we went out that window right now we'd

have a chance...

BETTY

I better go check on them.

CHARLIE

Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered

me.

BETTY

This is really awkward...

CHARLIE

Ahh, it's too late, anyway.  It's too

late.

(BEAT)

Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe

take one of them with me... If you'd

gimme my gun back.

140.

BETTY

I'd rather not...

CHARLIE

Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in

some stinking prison.  No way.  I've got

some professional pride.  And I don't

want anybody else to get the credit for

taking me out.

BETTY

...what're you saying?

CHARLIE

When a Roman general knew a battle was

lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

CHARLIE (cont'd)

Did... did you really come here because

you love this guy?

BETTY

Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor.

I think.

CHARLIE

So all this...really was because of that

soap opera?  My son is dead because you

came out here to be with that doctor?  A

fake doctor?

BETTY

I wouldn't have put it quite that way,

but...

CHARLIE

Wesley didn't even want to come up here.

He warned me, but I insisted...

(BEAT)

I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?

BETTY

I don't think I am.

CHARLIE

I want you to listen to me, Betty.

People don't lie when they're about to

die.

141.

(BEAT)

You don't need that doctor.  You don't

need that actor.  You don't need any man.

It's not the forties, honey.  You don't

need anybody. You've got yourself...  and

that's more than most people can say.

ANCHORMAN

In a story that police say is bizarre,

even for Hollywood, a father-son team of

killers tracked a Kansas soap opera fan

halfway across the country, only to find

themselves the victims in a final, bloody

confrontation...

LYLA

This story is beyond belief, which is

perfect for us.  It's free advertising

and it's gonna run for months.

GEORGE

I don't think she can do it.  You saw

what happened.

LYLA

You fucked it up.  Who wouldn't freeze in

those circumstances?  And I don't care

what her problems are.  She wouldn't be

the first one in that cast with problems.

We have nothing to lose by making her an

offer.

GEORGE

What about me?  Don't you wanna know how

I feel about it?  I'm the one who...

LYLA

Why would I give a shit how you feel. And

I got news for you. I loved your 'icy

water' idea the other day... I'm toying

142.

with the idea of killing David Ravell off

in a boating accident.

GEORGE

That's not a bad idea.  How many episodes

before he comes back?

GEORGE (cont'd)

Jesus, don't do that!  If it gets around

that you fired me, I'll never land a

pilot.

LYLA

Then do as you're told. Get her back.

GEORGE

I'm sorry for what I did.  It was

inexcusable.  I'm sorry for the things I

said, and for not respecting you, and for

all the stupid things that...

DARLENE

When you have a minute...

GEORGE

Look, I don't really like the whole idea

of autographs, and I'm kind of in the

middle of...

DARLENE

Don't flatter yourself.  It's the check.

GEORGE

Oh.  Of course... sorry.

BETTY

(grabbing it up)

My treat.  You were saying... something

about how stupid you've been?

143.

GEORGE

Right... I was.  I was an idiot, plain

and simple, and I hope you can find it in

your heart to forgive me.  How's that?

BETTY

Kinda like you'd been saying it since you

got on the plane...

GEORGE

I have... did it sound that bad?

BETTY

Mmm-hmm.  Listen, I forgive you, Mr.

McCord...

GEORGE

George...

BETTY

... George.  I do.

(BEAT)

My best friend once said if you were any

handsomer it would be a crime...

GEORGE

Thanks...

BETTY

... it's too bad you're such an asshole.

'S the only thing that Del was ever right

about.

GEORGE

No, that's... okay.  Fair enough.

(BEAT)

So, now that we've sort of settled the

'asshole' thing, is there any chance

you'll come back to the show?  At all?

150     INT. TV DINER - DAY                                    150

BETTY

... there's always a chance, David.

DAVID

Right.  But will there be a tomorrow, and

the next day, and the next?

144.

BETTY

(whispering to him)

Doctor, if you were any handsomer it'd be

a crime...

DAVID

I guess that means you're free tonight.

Of course, it's up to you...

BETTY

No, it's up to us.  I love you, David.

And I want to see you tomorrow, and the

next day, and the next day...
