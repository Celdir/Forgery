"KATE AND LEOPOLD"

Screenplay by

James Mangold and Steven Rogers

Based on a story by

Steven Rogers

LEOPOLD

You dance like a herd of cattle,

Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman

who lights up the room... simply by

leaving it.

UNCLE OTTO

Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join

us downstairs after completing this

one-sided flash of wit?

LEOPOLD

I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle

Otto. No one really listens to anyone

else. If you attempt it, you will

see why.

UNCLE OTTO

You judge everything too severely. I

wonder what would happen if you were

to cast that critical eye inward?

LEOPOLD

You do not wonder at all. You merely

ask in order to state your own

opinion.

UNCLE OTTO

We are all concerned about you.

LEOPOLD

Ahh, here it comes.

UNCLE OTTO

Your life does not seem to have any

direction. At the age of 25 a man is

too young to do anything well. At 35

he is too old. Now is your time to

take action. Tell me, what is it you

want to DO with your life?

LEOPOLD

(wearily)

I do not know.

UNCLE OTTO

(just as weary)

Your ignorance cramps my conversation.

(he slaps Leopold's

face twice rather

quickly)

Wake up! This is your one and only

life. Every man has the chance to

make a difference. DO something!

LEOPOLD

I am most grateful for your

surveillance and for your sympathy.

I assure you there is no need for

concern. I am as effectual and

attentive... as my position allows.

UNCLE OTTO

Life is not position, Leopold. It is

action.

(he straightens

Leopold's tie)

I will see you downstairs promptly.

In the appropriate frame of mind.

THE VALET

(grandly)

Go spread joy.

LEOPOLD

You dance like an angel, Miss

Fairchild. You light up the room. I

thank you.

LEOPOLD

Good evening. I do not believe I

have had the pleasure.

CARLSON

...Julia Carlson.

CARLSON

I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

LEOPOLD

(slightly tipsy)

You are not from the area, are you?

CARLSON

(smiles and shakes

her head "No")

Are you?

LEOPOLD

This is my estate.

CARLSON

Really?

(looking around the

room)

Well it's not home but it's much...

LEOPOLD

Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.

CARLSON

The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't

it?

LEOPOLD

It is a scandal nonetheless.

LEOPOLD

Miss Carlson, do me the honor?

CARLSON

I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.

LEOPOLD

(smiling seductively)

Truly I would be in your debt. Any

admonition would be erased simply by

presenting a partner as lovely as

yourself.

CARLSON

No, no. Really, I...

LEOPOLD

I suppose we really ought to sing

along.

CARLSON

(embarrassed)

Oh, golly.

CARLSON

(breathless)

Thank you for the dance. It was

lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful

for you.

LEOPOLD

Not at all. It was most enlightening.

CARLSON

I really must be going.

LEOPOLD

I won't hear of it.

CARLSON

(moving away from him)

No, I'm quite late as it is.

LEOPOLD

I shall see you to the door...

CARLSON

(stopping him

resolutely)

You're very sweet. I had a wonderful

time.

(she watches him,

memorizing his face.

Then firmly)

Goodbye.

LEOPOLD

Miss Carlson?

LEOPOLD

Good God...

CARLSON

What are you...? You frightened me.

LEOPOLD

What sort of mechanism is this?

LEOPOLD

Answer me!

CARLSON

It's perfectly all right. It's...

CARLSON

(carefully,

deliberately)

Listen to me. Please. Move very

slowly. Step out of the machine.

Step out and I'll explain whatever

you want to know.

LEOPOLD

What is this? Who are you?

CARLSON

Oh, God.

CARLSON

(suddenly frantic)

Get out of there! Get out now!

LEOPOLD

Miss Carlson... I...

CARLSON

No!!!

CARLSON

Shit!!

CUT TO:

DR. KAU

Shit!!

DR. KAU

Shit!!

DR. KAU

Shit!!

DR. DRAKE

Good God!

DR. PLODDER

Everybody stay calm... Lock the front

door.

DR. PLODDER

No, no, no. You mustn't touch him.

The consequences could be

catastrophic.

DR. KAU

He could be hurt, or even dead.

DR. PLODDER

...All right. Touch him.

DR. KAU

...But I'm stuck and it's only a

dance and he IS the seventh Duke of

Albany...

DR. DRAKE

Carlson...!

DR. PLODDER

(racing from the room)

Give me a minute...

DR. KAU

Shit!

KATE

Who's upset? People fall in love,

they have to climb back out.

(she laughs but she

is not smiling)

So, what? We'll just be friends now,

Right?

KATE

I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.

(using her middle

finger she pushes up

her glasses)

No. I'll just think of this as

surviving another dating accident.

Take care or good luck or whatever

I'm supposed to...

KATE

...say... Goodbye.

DR. PLODDER

She's back.

KATE

(rising)

That's impossible! She wasn't supposed

to return until...

DR. PLODDER

Kate. It's Carlson. Something went

wrong.

KATE

...The 7th Duke...

KATE

(all business, reading

from a printout)

...of Albany. He was the... IS the

son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no

actual importance until he vanished

at the turn of the century without a

trace. It was a sensation. In the

30's they even made a movie about

him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald

Coleman.

DR. DRAKE

(absently)

I love Ronald Coleman.

KATE

Despite much speculation and a nation

wide investigation, a body was never

found. He was never heard from again.

DR. KAU

Until now.

DR. DRAKE

We've altered the course of history.

DR. KAU

We never should have started this...

KATE

Calm down.

DR. PLODDER

What are we going to do? We can't

keep him here. Imagine if anyone

found out!

KATE

Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now,

no one would believe such a stupid

mistake could be made because no one

would believe any of this is possible.

So. We fix this. We keep this to

ourselves and we fix it. Fast.

KATE

Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st

priority: Locate Carlson. Drake,

determine the reciprocal correlation's

connected to the 19th century. Work

24 hours a day if necessary. In the

meantime... one of us will have to

take charge of him.

KATE

This is a major scientific

opportunity. It doesn't get any better

than this. Imagine. Researching the

behavior, the physical and emotional

characteristics of a century ago!

Utilizing technology available to us

today... He's a gold mine!

DR. PLODDER

He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.

KATE

And while he's here, he's ours. Any

volunteers?

DR. DRAKE

We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked

will be responsible. Agreed?

DR. KAU

I'll do it.

DR. PLODDER

You'll look after him?

DR. KAU

No, I meant I'll pick the name.

KATE

Fine.

LEOPOLD

Where...? What has happened?!

KATE

Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee

aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge

research team. A project funded by

the government of the United States.

LEOPOLD

(regarding their

appearance with

distaste)

Oh. Americans. I see...

KATE

Yes, um... For the past six and a

half years we've been conducting

scientific experiments on density

and flexibility in the dimensions of

time and space.

DR. DRAKE

Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came

upon a formula utilizing Tachyons...

particles traveling faster than the

speed of light, which allowed us

to... fold time so to speak.

DR. PLODDER

Yes. Bend it between the cracks of

the dimensions.

DR. KAU

Yes.

DR. DRAKE

Now, while that wasn't the original

purpose of our experiment, we opted

to pursue it, well, privately, on

our own.

DR. KAU

Borrowing funds already provided.

KATE

We journeyed to your time because it

was the quickest path to follow. We

debated long and hard whether we

should use this knowledge at all.

Believe me, it was never our intent

to disturb the past...

DR. DRAKE

Merely to discover if the expedition

were possible. As your presence here

confirms... we are very disturbed.

DR. PLODDER

The problem facing us is not only

HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you

see?

KATE

We certainly don't want to

miscalculate. Send you to a different

era entirely.

DR. PLODDER

Rest assured, no harm will come to

you. You'll be well looked after by

Dr. Coles.

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What

do you mean, get me back home?...

Where am I?

LEOPOLD

Answer me!...

(slowly)

Would you have me believe... I am

being detained, at present in the

HEREAFTER?... The time to come?

DR. PLODDER

(carefully)

It is the year nineteen hundred and

ninety-five.

LEOPOLD

...19...?

LEOPOLD

You're insane! All of you! This is

impossible!

DR. PLODDER

Leopold, calm down!

LEOPOLD

A voyage through time! What do you

take me for? Did you bring me here

by force?

DR. DRAKE

We're scientist, not seditionists.

LEOPOLD

(truly panicked)

Let me out of here! I won't stand

for this another moment!

KATE

Leopold, wait!

DR. KAU

You don't know what you're doing.

DR. PLODDER

Just listen to what we have to say!

LEOPOLD

19...?

CUT TO:

KATE

Squab.

DR. KAU

Squab?

KATE

I remember reading they ate a lot of

squab.

DR. KAU

Squab... Do you have a squab?

KATE

(quietly. On the verge

of panic)

I don't know!

DR. KAU

Pull yourself together!

(turning to Leopold)

Are you all right back there?

KATE

You're going to be fine you know.

There's nothing to worry about. I

have everything under control.

KATE

(quietly to Dr. Kau)

We'll never get away with this.

KATE

How are you feeling?

(no response)

I thought you might like some tea.

LEOPOLD

I insist on being returned home

immediately.

KATE

I understand. We're doing our best.

LEOPOLD

I wish to speak with your employer,

Dr. Coles.

KATE

You're speaking to him.

LEOPOLD

You are not suggesting that you are

Dr. Coles?

LEOPOLD

Miss... uh?

KATE

Dr. Coles. If you like, you could

call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's

too much, how about just plain Kate?

LEOPOLD

(coldly)

A WOMAN of science?

KATE

Hard to believe?

LEOPOLD

But a woman's brain cannot obtain

enough knowledge to posses a truly

scientific mind.

KATE

(jotting this down)

Interesting. Nevertheless, we've

come a long way baby.

LEOPOLD

(confused)

Are you attempting to be humorous?

KATE

I'm attempting to be informative

it's just coming out humorous.

KATE

(clinically)

Look, modern social science clearly

states that a woman's place in society

marks the level of that civilization.

A science career for a woman is now

almost as acceptable as being a...

a... waitress. Cream and sugar?

LEOPOLD

Young lady, I... Surely it is not

expected that I remain here with you

indefinitely... Unchaperoned?

KATE

(pen poised)

Does that make you nervous?

LEOPOLD

Certainly not!

KATE

(writing)

Then what are you getting so red

about? It's a very large apartment...

with locks on all the doors.

LEOPOLD

The idea! My dear Miss Coles...

KATE

Dr. Coles.

LEOPOLD

Honey...

KATE

(she puts the pad

down)

Let's get one thing straight right

now. My name is Kate or Katherine or

if you insist Dr. Coles.

(she rises)

Take a good long look, Leopold. I am

a 20th century American woman with a

Doctorate and a commission and

independence. I am not your "young

lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your

"honey." Is that clear?

LEOPOLD

Honey... For the tea.

KATE

...I'll get it for you.

LEOPOLD

Thank you... Has it been decided

what it is I am to do while I am

being held here?

KATE

Oh, just some laundry, the cooking,

a little light housework...

KATE

(clearing her throat)

I took the liberty of preparing a

simple schedule to efficiently utilize

your time while incorporating you

into my routine.

(she hands him a

schedule)

As you can see, my day begins with

meditation and yoga from 6:30 to

7:00.

KATE

YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and

change and at 7:15, we breakfast

together. 7:45 we begin the days

work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to

observe you in your natural routine

as I research the data that will

enable you to return home. At 1:15

we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a

daily questionnaire, I type up my

notes. At precisely 6:15 you will

enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then,

at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while

making dinner as YOU write down any

questions that come up during your

day. At 7:00, we dine together. If

you need me at any time you may ring

this bell.

KATE

Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have

computer science class, Tuesdays I

have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm

usually home by 9:15. During these

periods you may read any of the books

I've picked out for you in your room.

I organize my next days work at 10:30,

11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in

bed.

(she takes a breath,

smiles at him)

Next day we begin again. Simple?

LEOPOLD

(after a beat, with

great dignity)

...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Kate? I'm home.

KATE

Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.

LEOPOLD

Your father?

KATE

Sort of. My brother.

LEOPOLD

Visiting?

KATE

For the past two years. Charlie can

never know about this project. We'll

tell him you are a... overly

distinguished colleague staying here

as our guest. From Canada. Which

would explain your lack of familiarity

with our customs and so forth

LEOPOLD

(aghast)

A CANADIAN?

KATE

Make yourself comfortable. I'll check

in on you later. I think this is

going very well, don't you?

KATE

Okay. If you need anything, just

ring.

KATE (V.O.)

(shouting)

Charlie!

CHARLIE (V.O.)

(screaming just as

loud)

What?

KATE

(still shouting)

Come here I wanna talk to you.

CHARLIE

What did I do?

KATE

(removing his coffee

from the table,

setting it on a

coaster)

RINGS! And what did I say about you

smoking in the house?

CHARLIE

You were against it.

KATE

Correct. You're back early.

(She takes away his

cigarette)

CHARLIE

Hey!... Are you all right? You look

funny.

KATE

Funny ha ha or funny odd?

CHARLIE

Both.

KATE

That all depends. How was your trip?

CHARLIE

Why?

KATE

If it was good I'll tell you the

truth. If it was rotten I'll have to

butter you up first.

CHARLIE

Butter me up.

KATE

Have you been working out? No, I'm

really starting to see results. Are

you comfortable there on the couch?

CHARLIE

Very.

KATE

Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there

the next few nights.

CHARLIE

Kate!

KATE

You have to be out of here by 8 and

you can't be back before 6. We have

an important man working with us

with very unusual needs. The company

is insisting he stay here.

CHARLIE

What about a hotel?

KATE

This man requires around the clock

attention.

CHARLIE

I meant for me.

KATE

Thank you, Charlie.

(she kisses his

forehead)

I owe you one.

CHARLIE

You owe me nine. What am I supposed

to do all day?

KATE

(as if having an

epiphany)

You could get a job!

CHARLIE

Kate, the entire point of being an

artist is that I don't have to work.

Who is this guy?

KATE

Well, I can't tell you much because...

KATE AND CHARLIE

I'm not allowed to discuss what goes

on at the office.

KATE

Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be

interesting to have someone else to

talk to. It gets so quiet around

here sometimes I feel like I've gone

deaf.

CHARLIE

Does he have a label?

KATE

Leopold.

CHARLIE

LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his

name?

KATE

He's exactly like his name.

CHARLIE

Then you owe me ten.

LEOPOLD

Horrible!

KATE

(explaining)

He's from Canada...

LEOPOLD

(finally)

What is this?

KATE

It's called Hamburger Helper.

LEOPOLD

It is beyond help. Please serve the

next course.

KATE

I'm afraid there is no next course.

If you make a list of the foods you

like, I'll pick them up at the store

for you.

LEOPOLD

Is all food here this... textured?

CHARLIE

Mine's good.

LEOPOLD

Please understand, I am used to a

different sort of preparation. Where

I come from a proper meal is the

result of reflection and study. A

recipe is merely a theme which an

intelligent cook can plan each time

with variation.

LEOPOLD

Several courses are served. Menus

are often prepared days in advance,

timed to perfection. It is said,

without the culinary art, the

crudeness of reality would make life

unbearable.

CHARLIE

In Canada?

LEOPOLD

(after a beat. Firmly)

In Canada.

CHARLIE

We have a saying here. "Shake and

shake the catsup bottle, none will

come and then a lot'll."

LEOPOLD

How interesting.

CHARLIE

Since you're such an expert on fine

cuisine, why don't you make dinner

tomorrow night?

LEOPOLD

It should be obvious to you that I

am NOT a domestic. You may take my

plate.

CHARLIE

I have my own, thank you.

KATE

Charlie...

CHARLIE

Who died and made me Cinderella?

LEOPOLD

Young man, there is a distinct

impertinence to your voice.

CHARLIE

It's part of my charm.

LEOPOLD

Suppress it.

KATE

(changing the subject)

Leopold... Since you're our guest

here, there are several cultural

events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie

has season tickets to the ball game.

Perhaps you'd like to take that in?

LEOPOLD

What is it?

CHARLIE

What is it??

KATE

Or the Opera or the Ballet?

CHARLIE

What is it??

KATE

Charlie, there's no rule that says

everyone has to be interested in

baseball.

CHARLIE

No, but I believe there is a rule

that says everyone has to have HEARD

of it.

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles, your brother Charles

attitude and demeanor are

unacceptable. If I am to stay on

here you must have a serious talk

with him regarding respect and

civility.

KATE

CHARLES, could you help me with the

dessert in the kitchen?

CHARLIE

In the kitchen?

KATE

IN the kitchen. Excuse us.

CHARLIE

I don't believe this guy!

KATE

Try to be nice to him.

CHARLIE

I'm always NICE!

KATE

Please Charlie, as a favor to me.

CHARLIE

He gives me the creeps.

KATE

He's different that's all.

CHARLIE

What was that crack about domestics?

KATE

Charlie, this is important to me.

CHARLIE

You're not going out with him, are

you?

KATE

Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm

not a lost cause.

CHARLIE

Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys

you bring home.

KATE

I've done countless favors for you!

Now I'm asking for just one little

thing...

CHARLIE

(overlapping)

Oh, all right! All right! All right!

KATE

(after a beat)

We forgot the dessert.

CHARLIE

You know,... I don't know if I

mentioned it... but that is one fine

looking suit.

KATE

(too sweetly)

What is it, Leopold?

KATE

(eyes closed, screaming

like a fishwife)

WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!

LEOPOLD

(calmly amidst the

chaos)

I cannot seem to find the tea...

LEOPOLD

No... No... No. Good God, no!...

Perhaps...

KATE

Leopold, your time is up! What's he

got, a girl in there?

LEOPOLD

I should like to read about modern

currency during my bath tonight. See

that the tub and basin are scrubbed

up. Remnants remain of this afternoons

shave.

KATE

In our last session you intimated

there was a symmetrical system

regulating the social order of

conformity spanning your era. I found

this particularly intriguing If I

can just find it in my notes...

LEOPOLD

The fire brigade!

LEOPOLD

This is insufferable! I refuse to be

spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled

about any longer. I have yet to

venture outside this cell. Before I

go mad a more suitable arrangement

must be found.

KATE

Found it.

LEOPOLD

(startled)

A resolution?

KATE

No I meant I found my notes.

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.

KATE

I can hear you.

LEOPOLD

(under control now)

Miss Coles, as we are to remain here

together, there are certain conditions

I insist are met and maintained. I

no longer wish to be peeped at,

mocked...

KATE

I never...

LEOPOLD

(calmly)

Or interrupted. Jot this down.

Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner

at 8. A horse should be made available

from 1 to 3.

KATE

A horse? In New York City?

LEOPOLD

Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about

your style of dress. I do not care

for it.

(Kate looks up)

I cannot believe it is the prevailing

taste for women to appear masculine

and unkempt. If this is the fashion,

have it altered.

LEOPOLD

That is all for the present.

LEOPOLD

CRUMBS, my dear!

KATE

(infuriated)

Thank you!

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted

with many women in my time, yet I am

compelled to say that the modern

woman is by far the least attractive

I have ever encountered.

KATE

(rising to the occasion)

And I have a news flash of my own.

KATE

You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!

DR. DRAKE

Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough

Swirl or Peach?

DR. KAU

Peach.

DR. DRAKE

Any luck?

DR. KAU

Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No

information exists detailing what

happened to Carlson. I've been working

for weeks and I'm not any closer

than when I began... How are you

doing?

DR. DRAKE

My cholesterol level is up 70 points.

DR. DRAKE

Thank you, Kate... How're you managing

with Leopold?

KATE

Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?

DR. DRAKE

Nothing. I was just asking.

KATE

Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight.

Everything's under control.

DR. KAU

Keep up the good work.

(after she's gone)

She seemed a little scattered. Do

you think everything's all right?

DR. DRAKE

Katherine Coles is the most capable

person we have on this project. If

anyone can handle the delicacy of

this situation, Kate can.

DR. KAU

So there's nothing to worry about?

DR. DRAKE

Absolutely not.

KATE

GONE? GONE WHERE?!

(Charlie shrugs)

Charlie we've got to find him!

CHARLIE

(working on a VERY

STERN portrait of

Kate at her computer)

Are you crazy? This is the first

time all week my eyes aren't darting

to the top of my sockets every five

minutes.

KATE

When did he leave?

CHARLIE

I don't know. An hour ago? He said

he wanted to take a walk.

KATE

And you let him?? He's not allowed

to go outside!

CHARLIE

Is he being punished?

KATE

We've got to find him! You stay here

in case he finds his way back. And

while you wait you'd better pray

he's all right. If anything happens

to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING

we've worked for will have been

destroyed.

CHARLIE

Kate, calm down.

KATE

And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?

(she grabs her coat

and purse)

CHARLIE

What's the big deal? Who is this

guy?

KATE

Leopold... is not really from Canada.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

OH MY GOD!!!

WOMAN MOTORIST

You stupid fucking son of a bitch.

Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.

CABBY

What're ya waiting for lady? An

invitation?

KATE

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

LEOPOLD

(to the counter man)

$7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?

COUNTER MAN

You gotta problem with that?

LEOPOLD

It seems rather pricey to me.

COUNTER MAN

So don't buy one.

LEOPOLD

I shan't.

COUNTER MAN

So shan't!

LEOPOLD

Yes, I... I would be happy to sample

one however I'm afraid I haven't the

finance with me just now. If I could

establish a credit with you, I will

have someone come round with the

funds tomorrow.

COUNTER MAN

You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a

hamburger today, is that it?

LEOPOLD

(a little confused)

I believe so. Yes.

COUNTER MAN

Get the fuck outta here.

LEOPOLD

I beg your pardon?

COUNTER MAN

Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.

LEOPOLD

May I remind you, merchant, that I

am the customer in this establishment

and as such require your attention

and the utmost respect. I do not

accept this modern convention of

desecrating one's patrons with such

contemptuous disregard.

YUPPIE WOMAN

You tell him.

LEOPOLD

Need I add that without our patronage

you would not own that unwashed

counter behind which you spew your

filthy mouth?

COUNTER MAN

Where do you get off? You don't even

have any money.

LEOPOLD

Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.

COUNTER MAN

Not in my store you're not.

LEOPOLD

(very superior)

Do you intend to physically escort

me out...?

LEOPOLD

Did you see what he did? Did you see

that?

KATE

Leopold! Leopold, get in.

KATE

(nearly in tears,

trying to dry him

off)

Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're

all right. I didn't think I'd ever

find you. You had us all so worried.

Oh, Leopold!

KATE

Don't you ever go out again without

my permission, do you hear me? I was

frantic. You could have been killed

a hundred times over. I never would

have known.

KATE

Leopold, are you all right?

LEOPOLD

(looking deep into

her eyes for the

first time)

I wish to go home.

KATE

Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.

LEOPOLD

(badly shaken)

No... I wish to go home.

CHARLIE

(on the phone)

I don't know. It's just Leopold.

Like Cher. Or Goofy.

CHARLIE

Never mind they just walked in. Jesus.

You look horrible.

KATE

Charlie, don't start. I haven't been

this angry at you since you got me

into that pyramid thing last year.

If you make a wisecrack I'm going to

burst into flame.

CHARLIE

It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look

horrible.

KATE

I'm too tired for this now. I'll

just save it up and kill you tomorrow.

Help Leopold out of his things and

lets get him to bed.

LEOPOLD

I've something to say. To the both

of you. I... Nothing is what it seems.

After witnessing mere weeks of this

age it is painfully apparent I am

outside of my acquaintance... I don't

know how to proceed. I frankly... am

in need of assistance. I'm sorry.

I'm not very good at this. In the

event you have missed it, I am

apologizing.

CHARLIE

About time.

(he shakes Leopold's

hand reluctantly)

Welcome back.

(he leaves)

KATE

Don't mind him. His heart would be

in the right place if he had a heart.

Surliness runs in my family.

LEOPOLD

I understand. It practically races

through mine.

KATE

(shocked)

Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one

that's not at my expense. That's

good.

LEOPOLD

We'd better get to bed... That is...

KATE

Yes... I start work...

(she looks at her

watch)

in three and a half hours.

LEOPOLD

Oh, dear.

KATE

It's fine. I'm used to it.

LEOPOLD

You mustn't get too used to it. You'll

find life passes you by awfully

quickly.

LEOPOLD

Thank you for...

KATE

(waving it away)

Oh!

LEOPOLD

Well, goodnight then.

KATE

Leopold?... I don't have a clear

handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong

keeping you confined to the apartment

all this time. I don't know when

you'll be able return home... Tomorrow

I'll start preparing you for the

outside world. And... We'll find

your way back. I promise.

KATE (V.O.)

Yes?

LEOPOLD

Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was

merely... I didn't...

KATE

Is there something you want, Leopold?

LEOPOLD

I merely wanted to see... that is,

inquire, on your availability, for

an outing... My assimilation and so

forth.

KATE

Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of

us. I'll be out in a minute.

LEOPOLD

Yes, of course. Splendid.

CUT TO:

LEOPOLD

Are you certain this is correct?

KATE

Certainly I'm certain.

LEOPOLD

Now really. Isn't this better?

LEOPOLD

Allow me.

LEOPOLD

Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LEOPOLD

Have you seen today's paper?

KATE

Put it back.

LEOPOLD

But...

KATE

Back!

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles, why is it you are not

married?

KATE

Women are longer defined by the men

they're married to, Leopold. I have

a career. I haven't found a man who

fits in with that yet.

LEOPOLD

Yet people still marry?

KATE

(defensively)

I've heard of cases.

LEOPOLD

I suspect there is something wrong

with you.

KATE

There's nothing wrong with me!

LEOPOLD

Perhaps it is the way you present

yourself.

KATE

I don't know what you're talking

about.

LEOPOLD

There is some sort of problem when a

woman reaches thirty and insists on

remaining single.

KATE

You think I'm THIRTY?!

LEOPOLD

What?

KATE

Do I look THIRTY to you?

LEOPOLD

It was an arbitrary number.

KATE

You chose it specifically opposed to

a lower number.

LEOPOLD

I didn't mean it.

KATE

...Thirty!

LEOPOLD

I apologize... How old are you?

KATE

(sharply)

I'm thirty! But you're the first

person whoever told me I looked it!

LEOPOLD

I'm sorry.

KATE

And it's not that I insist on

remaining single. Believe me. Everyone

dreams of finding somebody to share

their life with. To give someone all

the love they've been hoarding since

they were a kid. I'm no different.

But one has to be sensible. I have a

career and a life that's filled

with...

KATE

Not again...

KATE

What do I have to do? Put a leash

around your neck?

LEOPOLD

(to the saleslady)

She is the woman to whom I was

referring. You see the problem?

SALESLADY

(giving Kate the once

over)

Yep.

KATE

(staring down at her

clothes then back at

the two of them)

What?... What?

KATE

This is ridiculous. I don't have

time to...

(she shrieks)

Do you know what this dress costs?

Let's get this over with. I'm coming

out. Nobody laugh.

KATE

Satisfied?

KATE

...What?

LEOPOLD

You have a lovely face.

LEOPOLD

(quietly)

We'll take the dress.

LEOPOLD

What is this?

KATE

The drug of the 20th century.

KATE

Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.

LEOPOLD

I'm coming.

KATE

(making notes)

It's a guy thing.

KATE

...Now within that astronomical

structure, Dr. Drake here is searching

for a pathway between your time and

the present. He'll find it too if

his arteries don't harden first.

LEOPOLD

Astounding.

KATE

Once that is discovered, the search

begins for the exact time and date

travel will be possible.

LEOPOLD

(to Dr. Kau)

How are you proceeding?

KATE

Don't take it personally. Once Dr.

Kau starts working, you just have to

wait until her batteries run down.

We're all pretty much like that.

LEOPOLD

The complexity of this equation is

astonishing? Can you really comprehend

all that?

KATE

(simply. Almost

apologetically)

I'm a genius.

LEOPOLD

You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.

(a beat)

That is to say, you all are.

KATE

Thank you. And may I say that

sometimes, in DIM light, you're not

so bad yourself.

KATE

Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm

late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.

LEOPOLD

May I accompany you?

KATE

You mayn't.

LEOPOLD

I am not certain I understand therapy.

KATE

No one does. That's why therapists

can charge so much.

LEOPOLD

What exactly transpires during

therapy?

KATE

Leopold. A gentleman does not ask

those questions. Come on, we'll get

you home.

LEOPOLD

I am perfectly able to travel homeward

myself.

LEOPOLD

Really! I have finance and our

address. I shall take a cabbie.

LEOPOLD

You are late. I insist. I am NOT a

child. Dr. Coles.

KATE

All right. Don't bite my head off.

LEOPOLD

I can't seem to...

NUN

(impatiently)

Oh, for heaven's sake...

MRS. PINCUS

I was worried. I thought you weren't

going to make it.

KATE

(smiling happily)

Miss my lesson? This is the only

thing I have to look forward to all

week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?

INSTRUCTOR

All right, kids. Pair up!

INSTRUCTOR

Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the

music.

KATE

(sweating)

I am!

INSTRUCTOR

Dancing should not be work. It should

be a vacation the body takes from

the mind. Let the music wash over

you.

KATE

(frustrated)

It is!

INSTRUCTOR

Repeat after me: I've got the muusic

in me.

KATE

I've got the muusic in me.

INSTRUCTOR & KATE

(overlapping)

I've got the muusic in me!

INSTRUCTOR

Keep telling yourself that.

DR. KAU

I've located her.

DR. PLODDER

You didn't! Is she all right?

DR. KAU

No. She's really not.

DR. KAU

It was taken a year after she arrived.

Look at her face! We have to get her

back.

DR. PLODDER

Christine, this morning I spoke with

the head of funding. They're talking

about canceling the project.

DR. KAU

What?! They can't do that!

DR. PLODDER

There's still time. Nothing has

happened yet that can't be undone.

We'll get her back. We'll put this

behind us and we'll get her back.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Is there something on your mind?

LEOPOLD

This is rather difficult for me.

CHARLIE

...Uh huh...?

LEOPOLD

I have been in the salon contemplating

the reception I have received by the

various tradesmen I have visited.

I've determined I am lacking the

dexterity of modern intercourse.

CHARLIE

Of what??

LEOPOLD

Social skills.

CHARLIE

Oh.

LEOPOLD

I realize our association has been

rather distant and I bear you no ill

will.

CHARLIE

You can imagine my relief.

LEOPOLD

The fact is... I need help.

CHARLIE

Why not ask Kate?

LEOPOLD

I would appreciate the masculine

point of view.

CHARLIE

Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.

CHARLIE

Well? Let's see... I guess we could

start by removing that great big

stick from up your... Let's start

with your walk.

LEOPOLD

My walk?

CHARLIE

You don't walk right.

(gently)

You strut.

LEOPOLD

(very defensive)

STRUT?

CHARLIE

Strut strut strut. You walk into the

bathroom it's like I'm watching a

parade. Walk across the room.

LEOPOLD

I will not.

CHARLIE

I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You

asked for my help. Trust me on this.

LEOPOLD

That's enough! Really! You walk.

CHARLIE

(between choruses)

See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.

CHARLIE

That's better. Now, try to enjoy

your walk. It's a beautiful day. The

sun is shining, the peasants are

singing.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Interesting?

CHARLIE

What the hell is that?

LEOPOLD

What?

CHARLIE

Leopold, are you wearing a corset?

LEOPOLD

Naturally.

CHARLIE

What'd ya say was the name of this

number?

LEOPOLD

Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.

CHARLIE

(deadpan)

Pretty.

CHARLIE

Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.

LEOPOLD

What in the world...?

MAN

Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?

WOMAN

She's another Babe Ruth. We had no

idea. Are you okay?

WOMAN

What do you have to say for yourself,

Elizabeth?

ELIZABETH

I'm sorry!

LEOPOLD

Is this your child?

MAN

Yes.

LEOPOLD

I see.

WOMAN

C'mon honey, lets go.

ELIZABETH

I want my ball.

LEOPOLD

Just a moment!

(bending down to

Elizabeth, firmly)

Pick a hand.

LEOPOLD

My mother's name was Elizabeth.

(then to her parents)

She's a beautiful child. You're very

lucky.

MAN

What do you say, Elizabeth?

MAN

Thank you.

LEOPOLD

I understand pumpkin pies, pizza

pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone

would explain Eskimo pies.

LEOPOLD

You smoke Camel's, you wear Old

Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew.

It's revolting.

(to Kate)

The pudding tonight is excellent.

Another thing I've noticed, everyone

is in a great rush today. Instant

Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick,

Minute Maid. You'll find there's

much to be said for moderation and

languor.

LEOPOLD

Mmmm. Is it tapioca?

KATE

It's margarine.

LEOPOLD

(taking the spoon out

of his mouth)

It's marvelous.

CHARLIE

Well, I'm off.

KATE

Me too. Work to do. Where are you

going?

CHARLIE

I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine.

It's this coffee house we go to.

KATE

Say hello to Dennis for me.

LEOPOLD

Who is that?

CHARLIE

Dennis is this really good looking

friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's

alive because SHE doesn't know how

to flirt.

KATE

As a rule I don't like to associate

with really good looking people. It

makes me feel really... I don't

know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice

guy.

CHARLIE

And he always picks up the check.

LEOPOLD

Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.

CHARLIE

What?

KATE

That's a wonderful idea! Leopold

mentioned how he wanted to meet...

People of quality was it?

CHARLIE

Ahhhhh?

LEOPOLD

If you'd rather I didn't go...

KATE

Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to

hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going

to think you don't want him to go.

CHARLIE

Oh it's not that. It's just that

it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all.

I'm not sure you'd have such a good

time.

LEOPOLD

A little ribald humor? I'm not as

big a stick in the mud as you might

think! I'd enjoy a gay night out,

kicking up my heels.

CHARLIE

Finish off your Parquet and we'll

go.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

There they all are. Now one more

thing. Throw the words "like" and

"you know" into a sentence whenever

possible. It's how people talk today.

LEOPOLD

Proper speech does not cease to exist

simply because it is ignored.

CHARLIE

Please?

LEOPOLD

Charles, you needn't fret. I have

the walk down pat. I will not give

myself away. Like.

CHARLIE

(looking in the window)

Oh shit!

(correcting himself)

Shoot.

LEOPOLD

What is it?

CHARLIE

Patrice. See that girl? The blonde

one? She's so inconceivably hot.

LEOPOLD

She's very pretty.

CHARLIE

She's mine.

LEOPOLD

Congratulations.

CHARLIE

Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her

first.

LEOPOLD

I understand.

CHARLIE

Okay. I guess we should go in. I

don't suppose we could tell everyone

you don't speak English?

LEOPOLD

Of course not. Let's go inside.

ALL

(ad lib greetings)

Charlie! Where've you been? etc.

CHARLIE

Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend,

Leo.

BILL

Hey.

LEOPOLD

Hey.

DENNIS

Waz up?

LEOPOLD

Waz up?

PATRICE

How are ya?

LEOPOLD

How are ya?

CHARLIE

(after a beat)

Leo's staying with us for a while.

LEOPOLD

May I?

PATRICE

Help yourself.

LEOPOLD

Thank you, my dear.

CHARLIE

(at a loss)

Um?...

(all look at Charlie)

...I have nothing to say.

LEOPOLD

You did not tell the truth about

Patrice, Charles.

DENNIS AND BILL

CHARLES??

CHARLIE

What did I tell you, LEO?

LEOPOLD

He informed me you were inconceivably

HOT, but I think you're lovely.

Exceptionally lovely.

PATRICE

Thank you, Leo.

CHARLIE

(to the waitress)

Check please.

CHARLIE

Just drop it Leopold.

LEOPOLD

But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I

am not interested in her.

CHARLIE

Hah!

LEOPOLD

In any case the problem is not with

me but with you.

(quietly)

You have no idea what it takes to go

about courting a woman. From what

I've witnessed tonight, it is

symptomatic of your entire generation.

CHARLIE

(almost speechless)

You are some piece of work, Leopold.

LEOPOLD

Now I do not wish to get personal...

LEOPOLD

But you have been of great assistance

to me and I feel this is one area

where I can be of some real help.

CHARLIE

I'm fascinated. Go on.

LEOPOLD

Now, why was I successful with this

young lady and why did you so

miserably fail?

CHARLIE

What makes you think she likes you?

LEOPOLD

Well she gave me the number of her

telephone and I assumed it meant...

CHARLIE

Go on.

LEOPOLD

As I see it, the girl hasn't an

inkling of your intentions. And it's

no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry

Andrew.

CHARLIE

A what?

LEOPOLD

A Merry Andrew.

CHARLIE

I am not!!

LEOPOLD

Everything plays like a farce to

you. The more wit, the less courage.

I believe the modern woman desires

passion, protection, sensitivity. No

woman wants to be romanced by a

buffoon.

(the old woman shakes

her head)

Banter and repartee are fine but you

must add to that a different sort of

playfulness.

CHARLIE

You think I should pounce?

LEOPOLD

I'm saying you must treat her with

respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude

pass. A woman of Kate's stature would

never respond to an artificial tactic.

CHARLIE

Kate?

LEOPOLD

What?

CHARLIE

You said Kate.

LEOPOLD

I did not.

CHARLIE

Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?

LEOPOLD

We are discussing your problem.

CHARLIE

Not anymore. You like my sister.

LEOPOLD

Charles...

CHARLIE

She has trouble with men, you know.

LEOPOLD

Perhaps she has not met the right

one.

CHARLIE

She has met the right one. HUNDREDS

of times. But she pulls back. She

cuts herself off. You turn around

and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.

LEOPOLD

One never can tell.

CHARLIE

Does Kate know how you feel?

LEOPOLD

No...

CHARLIE

Have you made your intentions known

to her?

LEOPOLD

No...

CHARLIE

Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think

you're all talk and no action. What

are you waiting for?

LEOPOLD

I do not know if there is a future

in it.

CHARLIE

Well Leopold, no one ever does...

CUT TO:

KATE

(reading out loud)

Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out --

slow soulful kissing... Woman as

equals??

KATE

Who drove the Chevy to the levy and

why was it dry?

KATE

Eyes shine when she talks about...

science. Raises her voice when she

knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY,

BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when

I see her smile. Most beautiful when

she's angry. Honorable heart...

Peasant feet.

KATE

Ooops. Bread and butter.

LEOPOLD

What's that?

KATE

Bread and butter. It's an old

saying... Well not to you I guess.

You say it when you pass someone in

a cramped space. As close as bread

and butter.

LEOPOLD

I see.

KATE

So. Did you have a good time last

night?

LEOPOLD

It was very interesting.

KATE

Did you find that person of quality?

LEOPOLD

Yes. I did.

KATE

Well... fine.

(there is a pause)

I guess it's time to turn in.

LEOPOLD

Yes.

KATE

Goodnight.

LEOPOLD

Kate?

LEOPOLD

Goodnight.

(he slowly closes the

door)

CHARLIE

Hi. I brought you some flowers.

PATRICE

Charlie!

CHARLIE

Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering

if you would do me the great honor

of accompanying me to the cinema

tonight. And allowing me the privilege

of escorting you to dinner afterwards.

PATRICE

It's beautiful.

CHARLIE

(deadpan)

Gracing me with your conversation

and company would mean the world to

me.

PATRICE

Um... 7:00?

CHARLIE

7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.

LEOPOLD

(silently mouthing)

Goodbye.

CHARLIE

Goodbye.

(she closes the door)

It worked!

LEOPOLD

Of course it did.

CHARLIE

Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea

what to do next!

LEOPOLD

Charles. Leave everything to me.

CHARLIE

Not so fast, buddy. You're next.

LEOPOLD

Good morning.

KATE

Good morning. You're up early.

LEOPOLD

I'm terribly sorry!!

KATE

Happens all the time...

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was

wondering...

LEOPOLD

What it is you're working on.

KATE

Oh. It's my computer.

LEOPOLD

I see. Actually I meant the work

itself.

KATE

I'm researching the correlations

between your time and the present.

KATE

I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.

LEOPOLD

Oh.

LEOPOLD

I have never seen a woman work as

diligently and extensively before.

KATE

It's made me the man I am today.

LEOPOLD

It's quite a beautiful day, have you

noticed? Perhaps you would permit

yourself some time off and grant me

the privilege of escorting you around

the city this fine Spring afternoon.

KATE

Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've

got too much work to do. Ask Charlie

though. He'll go with you.

LEOPOLD

I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the

same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.

KATE

(gently)

Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.

LEOPOLD

I see. Some other time then.

KATE

Yes... Thank you.

KATE

Oh for crying out loud. Would you

look at this? Leopold? The computer's

on the blink again.

(she bangs harder)

Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...

LEOPOLD

Maybe if you...

KATE

NO, no, it does this all the time.

Just have to wait it out.

LEOPOLD

I see.

KATE

Darn.

LEOPOLD

...Perhaps it is a sign?

KATE

Oh, you think?

(she smiles at Leopold)

KATE

I... I must have gotten a funny

horse...

LEOPOLD

Allow me.

LEOPOLD

Is that supposed to be my hair? Do

you see how they think my hair looks?

KATE

That's simplicity in it's purest

form. It speaks volumes in it's

nothingness. Whiteness representing

emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak.

Bleak!

LEOPOLD

Aaand this represents...?

KATE

Absolutely nothing.

LEOPOLD

(very quietly)

I'd almost forgotten how beautiful

it was. Truly. Beautiful.

LEOPOLD

(laughing)

M & M's, CBS, FBI.

KATE

VIP, VHS, VCR.

LEOPOLD

Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.

KATE

I don't know. K.D. Lang.

LEOPOLD

I don't know how you keep up with

it. I'm exhausted.

KATE

So am I.

LEOPOLD

I'll tell you what. Why don't I

prepare dinner tomorrow night? I

never have before. I mean even before

I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I

can't imagine what it'll taste like,

but I don't think it will be any

worse than your cooking.

KATE

Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.

LEOPOLD

I see.

KATE

A blind date.

LEOPOLD

Oh, I'm so sorry.

KATE

No, that just means I haven't met

him before. It was set up through

friends.

LEOPOLD

Ah!

KATE

A hazard of single life... I'm turning

in.

LEOPOLD

Another time then.

KATE

I'm sorry.

LEOPOLD

It's quite all right.

KATE

Leopold? I had a wonderful time today.

I can't remember the last time I

took the day off and just played.

I'd forgotten how beautiful this

city can be... I want to thank you

for that.

LEOPOLD

The pleasure was mine.

CHARLIE

It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold.

Are you sure you can teach me

everything there is to know?

KATE

(from the bathroom)

Just don't swipe the silverware and

give yourself away.

CHARLIE

Nobody's talking to you.

LEOPOLD

It is very simple. I will be your

date. Just behave as you normally

would and I'll correct you along the

way. Now, escort me in.

CHARLIE

Now what?

LEOPOLD

Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.

KATE (V.O.)

No name calling.

LEOPOLD

(to Kate)

Well, really!

LEOPOLD

You're not shoveling coal into a

furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in

gently. Gently. Try it again.

LEOPOLD

Well, sit down!

CHARLIE

Now don't burst a vein or anything,

but there are quite a few knives and

forks here. How do I know what each

one's for?

LEOPOLD

Merely start from the outside and

work your way in.

CHARLIE

What kind of beer should I order?

LEOPOLD

Beer!

CHARLIE

I WAS KIDDING!

KATE

How do I look?

LEOPOLD

You look exquisite, Katherine.

KATE

(almost sadly)

Thank you, Leopold.

CHARLIE

This is a tie I'm wearing.

KATE

You look very nice, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Yes. I know.

KATE

That must be him.

LEOPOLD

Your bland date?

KATE

Blind date.

CHARLIE

Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't

use to many big words. You'll scare

the poor slob away.

KATE

(moving to the door)

This is always the scary part.

(she sings)

"Open the door to my, Mystery Date."

LARRY

Hi. Kate?

KATE

Larry?

KATE

Well, I'm off.

LEOPOLD

(giving Larry the

once over)

Kate, may I have a word with you?

KATE

Now?

LEOPOLD

Yes.

(as they cross the

room)

I DON'T like the look of him.

KATE

What are you talking about?

LEOPOLD

Cad. I can spot one a mile away.

(he helps her with

her coat)

I shall escort you out myself. I

will act as your chaperone.

KATE

That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.

LEOPOLD

It is no trouble.

KATE

Goodnight, Leopold.

LEOPOLD

But...

KATE

Goodnight.

LARRY

(friendly)

Sit down.

KATE

(sighs)

Thank you.

(she sits)

LARRY

So. How am I doing?

KATE

I beg your pardon?

LARRY

How am I doing? First date. You

pleased? You disappointed?

KATE

Undecided.

LARRY

I see.

LARRY

So. What did Jeannie say about me?

KATE

About you? Ah, she said you were

tall.

LARRY

6'3.

KATE

And nice looking.

LARRY

Thank you.

KATE

Thank her. And that you persevere

ardently on Wall Street.

LARRY

Well, I work there...

KATE

(after a beat)

That must be very interesting.

LARRY

(laughing)

You've obviously never worked on

Wall Street.

KATE

(laughing along for

the hell of it)

No.

LARRY

What else did Jeannie say about me?

PATRICE

Have I told you how much I liked

your painting?

CHARLIE

(beaming)

Twice.

PATRICE

If you get tired of hearing about

it, let me know. I have to admit I

was sort of surprised when you called.

I didn't think you liked me, Charlie.

CHARLIE

When I first saw you, I thought...

(he makes his jaw

drop down to the

floor)

PATRICE

What do you think now?

KATE

Aaand that's about all Jeannie said.

What did Jeannie say about me?

LARRY

(smiling)

She said you were enormously sexy,

had a great body, but you don't put

out.

KATE

Quite a compelling portrait.

LARRY

(turning on the charm)

Would you say it's an accurate

portrait?

KATE

(leaning into Larry)

A masterpiece.

LARRY

So this guy wants to invest $50,000

in a stock that's no good. Here's

what I do...

LARRY

I'm telling you the guy was a DICK!

A total ASSHOLE!

KATE

(jarred awake)

Who?

LARRY

Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking

about. Hello?

KATE

(realizing her feelings

for Leopold, smiling

radiantly at Larry)

Goodbye.

KATE

Don't get up.

KATE

Leopold?

KATE

Leopold?

KATE

Oh, Leopold...

KATE

Oh!

LEOPOLD

Bread and butter.

LEOPOLD

You're back early. Did you enjoy

your date?

KATE

(happily)

No.

KATE

Here, you've got some...

LEOPOLD

Is it gone?

KATE

(laughing)

No.

KATE

(softly)

A funny thing happened to me on my

bland date this evening, Leopold. I

really can't explain it. This puffed-

up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn

kept popping into my mind all night

long at the most inopportune times.

I couldn't get rid of him.

LEOPOLD

How inconsiderate.

KATE

Yeah, it was. The harder I tried,

the more persistent he became. He's

conceited and inflated and unseasoned

and it doesn't seem to matter...

He's 134 years old but I can't get

him out of my head.

LEOPOLD

Is he there right now?

KATE

Right here. Larger than life.

LEOPOLD

I'll protect you...

LEOPOLD

Dr. Coles, would you grant me license

to dine with you tomorrow evening at

eight o'clock?

KATE

Permission granted.

LEOPOLD

Until tomorrow, then.

LEOPOLD

(a little startled)

You look beautiful.

KATE

YOU do. What have you got there?

KATE

Hamburger Helper!

LEOPOLD

I know you like it.

LEOPOLD

Tell me more.

KATE

Um, where was I? So after my father

died I had to go to work.

LEOPOLD

Have you had many jobs?

KATE

Many. I got fired from all of them.

I'm the most unskilled person I know.

But they were just survival jobs

while I was still in school. I always

knew I wanted to go into science

like my father. And I did.

LEOPOLD

Do you miss him?

KATE

I think about him every day. He was

courtly, just like you.

LEOPOLD

I think you are a remarkable woman

Katherine Coles.

KATE

You just don't get out much. You'd

be surprised how remarkable I'm not.

LEOPOLD

No, it is you who would be surprised.

LEOPOLD

Kate...

CHARLIE

Good morning.

PATRICE

Morning.

CUT TO:

KATE

Morning.

LEOPOLD

Good morning.

KATE

Look what you've done!

LEOPOLD

It's nothing.

KATE

Nothing? My own mother never made me

a breakfast like this.

LEOPOLD

I will have to have a talk with her.

KATE

Leopold...

LEOPOLD

Kate...

KATE

About last night...

LEOPOLD

Please sit down.

LEOPOLD

Kate, I had never before been a

considerate man. I had, with

astonishing complacency, squandered

my life, waiting for some incentive

to force me into action. You have

made me see how rare our time here

really is. I am most beholden to you

Kate. And always will be.

KATE

I sense the word "BUT" entering into

this any minute now.

LEOPOLD

Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming

my wife.

LEOPOLD

Shall I take that as a "yes"?

KATE

Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry

you?

LEOPOLD

I love you, Kate.

KATE

That's entirely beside the point...

You're moving way too fast here.

Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's

obvious the first one went well...

LEOPOLD

Where I come from that's pretty much

the way it works.

KATE

Leopold, even though last night we...

loved each other, that doesn't mean

this morning we're engaged. It just

doesn't work that way now.

LEOPOLD

(taking a ring off

his fingers and

placing it on hers)

I have loved you since I first set

eyes on you. I cannot imagine my

life without you beside me. I want

to marry you, Kate and make an honest

woman of you.

KATE

Oh Leopold, sit down.

KATE

Relationships these days are much

more complicated than that. Women

today have certain freedoms that men

have been taking advantage of for

centuries. You must have been aware

of that. If you think about it

clearly, it should be obvious to you

that marriage between us is out of

the question.

LEOPOLD

Do you not love me Kate?

KATE

(almost inaudible)

Don't ever think that...

LEOPOLD

Then consider my proposal.

KATE

I'll think it over but I can tell

you now the answer is...

KATE

(out of breath)

Possibly.

LEOPOLD

(a knowing smile)

I need you beside me. I will not

give up easily.

KATE

(smiling)

Do what you have to do...

CHARLIE

Morning.

LEOPOLD AND KATE

(too casual and too

chipper)

Morning!

LEOPOLD

(to Kate)

Coffee?

CHARLIE

(after a pause)

I would like some coffee.

KATE

Of course. Say when.

CHARLIE

(deadpan)

When.

KATE

Sorry.

CHARLIE

Uh huh.

CUT TO:

DR. KAY

(calling from her

office)

Kate, are you all right?

KATE

Fine! I'm fine.

LEOPOLD

Public office is apparently still

the last refuge for the incompetent.

Show me a man who does not want his

gun registered and I'll show you a

man who should not own a gun. What

is a pee-pee girl?

KATE

What are you reading?

LEOPOLD

The Village Voice. After much

consideration, I have decided it is

time I join the work force.

KATE

As a pee-pee girl?

LEOPOLD

Perhaps not that, but I am determined

to acquire honest employment.

KATE

Leopold, I don't know if that's such

a good idea.

LEOPOLD

Kate, my life back home was beneficial

to no one. I want my new life to

have value. I won't make the same

mistakes twice.

KATE

You have to be patient.

LEOPOLD

I could conceivably wait my whole

life away.

KATE

You're awfully cute when you get

causey.

LEOPOLD

I will not waste any more time. I

must make a difference.

LEOPOLD

Try our fragrance? Would you like to

try our new fragrance today?

RICH CUSTOMER

What is it?

LEOPOLD

It is called, POISON.

RICH CUSTOMER

Oh! I don't think so. Have you got

PASSION?

LEOPOLD

I beg your pardon?

RICH CUSTOMER

Elizabeth Taylor's Passion?

LEOPOLD

Next aisle over.

LEOPOLD

(after a beat)

Give your mother-in-law what she

really deserves this season. Give

her some POISON.

KATE

Hi.

(the doctors remain

silent)

What's the matter?

KATE

So you know.

DR. KAU

We had to go through your computer

to access information. Your

calculations have been verified and

the final course has been set. Leopold

goes back a week from Friday 1:17

a.m.

DR. PLODDER

How long were you going to keep it a

secret, Kate?

DR. DRAKE

Were you even going to tell us at

all?

KATE

I'm not sure.

DR. PLODDER

Not sure? What can you be thinking?

You can't alter the course of history

and assume everything will be okay.

It won't be. He has his own destiny

to fulfill in his own time.

KATE

(quietly)

You don't understand.

DR. DRAKE

(gently)

He's going back, Kate.

DR. PLODDER

It's over.

KATE

No... No, no, no.

CHARLIE

There you are. I've only been

hollering for the last...

CHARLIE

Kate? What is it? What happened?

KATE

(very detached)

It's time. Leopold's going back.

CHARLIE

Kate...

KATE

Yup. I'll get his things together.

Tell him tonight.

CHARLIE

Are you all right?

KATE

(pulling away)

I'm fine.

CHARLIE

You don't look so fine.

KATE

Well I am. It was wonderful having

him here, Charlie. He was of

invaluable assistance to the project.

(she shrugs)

I'll miss him.

CHARLIE

You'll miss him?

KATE

I will.

CHARLIE

Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!

CHARLIE

Kate, don't do this. Please. It's

not right.

KATE

What am I supposed to DO, Charlie??

I can't go back. He can't stay. I

can't let him go. I'm not equipped

to deal with this, Charlie. I don't

know how.

CHARLIE

Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be

the ice princess.

KATE

(beginning to tear up)

I'm not!

CHARLIE

You are. You can't live your whole

life under a microscope. You've got

to tell him how you feel.

KATE

(breaking down in his

arms)

It's too much, Charlie. It's just

too much.

CHARLIE

You owe it to him.

KATE

I didn't know I could feel like this.

I really didn't know.

LEOPOLD

So I looked him right in the eye and

said, 'Ego is nature's compensation

for mediocrity.' I turned and I

walked. He never said a word... He

probably didn't understand it...

Kate?

KATE

(cold)

What?

LEOPOLD

Are you all right? You're awfully

quiet.

KATE

I'm fine.

LEOPOLD

How was your day?

KATE

(taking a long pause)

It's time.

KATE

We're sending you back.

LEOPOLD

(slowly pushing his

plate away)

When?

KATE

A week from Friday, early morning.

LEOPOLD

No!

KATE

It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out

of our hands. We can't POCKET people

from history like stolen jewels. We

haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll

miss you.

LEOPOLD

Is that all?

KATE

What do you want me to do, fall apart?

You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't

solve anything.

LEOPOLD

Who is this woman sitting across

from me?

KATE

What do you want me to say, Leopold?

LEOPOLD

Tell me that you love me as I love

you. Let me hear you say it.

LEOPOLD

I will not do this. I'm sorry.

KATE

Leopold!

CUT TO:

LEOPOLD

Good God. Look at you. You look awful.

KATE

You should see what I'm looking at.

LEOPOLD

I went back to the restaurant. They

told me you went out looking for me

right after I left.

KATE

That was pound cakes ago. Where were

you?

LEOPOLD

I had a lot to think over.

KATE

Such as?

LEOPOLD

Just where I stand around here.

KATE

(quietly)

We should have come up with something

together. I might have been spared

ten or seventy pounds.

LEOPOLD

Is that an apology?

KATE

I'm sorry for what I said.

LEOPOLD

I'm not going anywhere.

KATE

Yes you are...

LEOPOLD

I'm not going. I'm staying here with

you.

KATE

But? You can't! We have no right

to...

LEOPOLD

It is my destiny. It is my decision.

KATE

Have you thought about what you'd be

sacrificing? Your influence? Your

authority?

KATE

Your family, your whole way of life,

everything?

KATE

You're not just feeling sorry for me

because I ate the contents of the

refrigerator, are you?

LEOPOLD

I love you, Kate. The single most

miraculous event in my life was not

how I arrived here, but that when I

did, I found you.

KATE

(overwhelmed)

Here comes the mushy part!

LEOPOLD

After much consideration I've come

to the conclusion I no longer desire

a large estate with a full staff and

ornate grounds.

KATE

That's good, because if you're staying

I'll probably get fired again. What

do you desire?

LEOPOLD

A beautiful wife, a small home in

the middle of nowhere, lots of

children, and fine schools with PMS

meetings every other Sunday.

KATE

...PTA?

LEOPOLD

PTA.

KATE

I love you too. I do, Leopold. I

love you, too.

DR. PLODDER

This is outrageous! I won't allow

it!

LEOPOLD

The decision is not yours to make.

DR. PLODDER

Do you realize what you're saying?

You're tampering with fate,

preordinance, and God himself.

LEOPOLD

We do that every day, doctor. It is

called CHOICE.

DR. KAU

Dr. Carlson is still over there. You

can't simply abandon her. We have to

get her back.

KATE

Do you think I'm not aware of that?

Do you think a minute goes by that I

don't feel responsible for her? But

SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO.

DR. KAU

Only one person can return. The

capsule accommodates only one person.

Leopold has to find her.

LEOPOLD

Perhaps she does not wish to return.

Perhaps she's found greater happiness

in her new life. It happened to me.

KATE

Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe

she's of more important use back

there.

DR. KAU

Julia Carlson died in the Center

Factory fire of 1897, two years after

she arrived. She was 37 years old.

DR. DRAKE

Dear lord.

DR. KAU

She was a friend, Kate. She was never

expected to sacrifice her life for

this experiment. I won't be a party

to it. I know what I'm asking...

There's no way we can force you to

go. Just think it over.

KATE

You're going back aren't you?

LEOPOLD

I keep seeing that poor woman's face.

She was terrified.

KATE

You said you wouldn't leave me...

I've never been lucky. Not one time.

LEOPOLD

Six months ago I wouldn't have given

it another thought. I wouldn't have

lost a moment's sleep. You've changed

me, Kate. There is no turning back.

KATE

I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's

what's tearing me up inside. Either

way I lose... You've changed me too.

I can't go back to my old life

anymore. I can't live like that again.

God my heart is pounding like a drum.

I've never been so scared in my life.

Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take

me with you.

LEOPOLD

You don't realize what you're saying!

You don't understand the kind of

life you'd lead. What you'd be giving

up.

KATE

I'd be with you.

LEOPOLD

I can't ask that of you.

KATE

Just ask me... Just ask.

LEOPOLD

Come back with me.

KATE

Yes!

KATE

Where are you taking me?

LEOPOLD

This is something I've wanted to do

for a long time.

KATE

Leopold?

LEOPOLD

This will be very therapeutic.

CUT TO:

DR. DRAKE

The time tables have been set. Just

strap yourself in and you'll be fine.

DR. PLODDER

You have only a twenty four hour

leeway before the machine is set to

return to us. You must find Carlson

within that time frame and get her

on board or there will be little

chance of her finding a way back.

LEOPOLD

I understand.

DR. DRAKE

It's been a real pleasure. You have

a much nicer smile than Ronald

Coleman.

LEOPOLD

The privilege was mine.

DR. KAU

Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.

(she gives him a kiss)

LEOPOLD

Oh, my.

DR. KAU

Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you...

as soon as possible. I'll see to it

myself.

LEOPOLD

See that you do.

DR. KAU

You have my word on it.

DR. DRAKE

Four minutes and counting.

CHARLIE

Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.

LEOPOLD

Goodbye.

(impulsively Leopold

embraces Charlie)

I shall miss you Charles, more than

you know.

CHARLIE

I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're

the only one who knows how to program

the VCR... Take care of my sister.

LEOPOLD

I will.

CARLSON

You better. Take care of yourself

too while you're at it... So long.

KATE

I don't have any words for this.

LEOPOLD

I will see you soon.

KATE

I know.

LEOPOLD

You'll be with me all the time.

KATE

I know. I brought you something.

KATE

So you wouldn't forget me.

LEOPOLD

Kate...

KATE

So you wouldn't think this was all a

dream.

KATE

Don't forget about me.

LEOPOLD

I love you, Kate.

KATE

Wait for me.

LEOPOLD

For as long as it takes.

KATE

I will come back to you! I will!

LEOPOLD

I'll be waiting.

DR. DRAKE

It's time Leopold.

DR. PLODDER

9 8 7 6 5 4...

DR. PLODDER

3 2 1!

DR. PLODDER

I cannot in good conscience let you

go. It's out of the question.

DR. DRAKE

I can't be a part of it either Kate.

I'm sorry.

DR. KAU

It's too big a risk.

DR. PLODDER

We cannot guarantee your child's

safety. It's that simple.

KATE

He's waiting for me. I can feel it.

Oh, Leopold...

CUT TO:

CARLSON

Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?

LEO

Yeah.

(yelling inside)

MOM??

CARLSON

You're Leo aren't you? You don't

remember me but I knew you when you

were yea big.

(she holds her hands

an inch apart)

LEO

Yeah.

CARLSON

I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your

mothers.

LEO

(proudly)

We had spaghetti at our house 4 times

this week.

KATE

Leo you don't have to holler like

that. I'm not deaf...

CARLSON

Kate?

KATE

...Carlson?!

KATE

Carlson, I don't believe it. It's

been... I don't know how many years.

What are you doing here.

CARLSON

I came to see you, sweetie.

KATE

You remember my son, Leo?

CARLSON

We've just been getting acquainted.

KATE

Well, come inside. Come inside.

KATE

(covering her agitation)

Would you like some tea? I wish you

had called before you come over. It

would have given me a chance to

straighten up the house... myself...

my life. Tell me what you've been up

to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard

you received some big endowment or

something. I was going to write,

then call, but...

CARLSON

It's all right, Kate. I understand.

CARLSON

You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a

lot of time to get your affairs in

order... And I warn you, it's nearly

impossible for an intelligent woman

back there.

CARLSON

He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would

be proud. We're aware of your

situation but we felt when the time

came, you deserved the option.

LEO

Who was that lady?

KATE

Just an old friend.

LEO

What she want?

KATE

(she looks at Leo)

Nothing important. You brush your

teeth?

KATE

Then give your old mom a hug and go

to bed.

(Leo gives her a hug

and a kiss)

Good night, cookie.

LEO

Good night.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KATE

He's so YOUNG, Charlie.

CHARLIE

He's old enough.

KATE

Look at that idiotic expression on

his face.

CHARLIE

He's happy.

KATE

Of course he's happy. All weddings

are happy. It's the living together

afterwards that causes all the

trouble.

KATE

Oh, you're so young... I love you,

Leo. Always remember that...

LEO

Mom, we're only moving to Denver.

KATE

I know, cookie. I know.

KATE

Well...

CHARLIE

I know. Me too.

KATE

What will I do without you, Charlie?

CHARLIE

(softly)

Live happily ever after.

CARLSON

(pushing the intercom

button)

Kate, it's time.

LEO

(emotionally)

Here. It's a letter for my father.

Tell him about me and... um, tell

him I love him. I want him to know

me.

KATE

Leo...

LEO

Mom, I want you to go.

KATE

But...

LEO

Go.

CARLSON

Ready!

CARLSON

9, 8, 7...

CARLSON

3, 2, 1!

FLIRT

(brushing his shirt

front)

I just love a starched white shirt.

It's so elegant.

LEOPOLD

Thank you.

FLIRT

Skeeky.

LEOPOLD

Yes. You dance like an angel Miss

Beall. You light up the room around

you. I thank you.

FLIRT

(with a big smile)

Thank YOU.

LORD WHITEHEAD

Who is that dancing with Leopold?

LADY WHITEHEAD

I've never seen her before.

FADE OUT:

THE END
