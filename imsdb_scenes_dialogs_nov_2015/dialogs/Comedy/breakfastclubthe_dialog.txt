1. EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

BRIAN (VO)

Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer

High School, Shermer, Illinois.

60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept

the fact that we had to sacrifice a

whole Saturday in detention for

whatever it was that we did wrong,

what we did was wrong.  But we think

you're crazy to make us write this

essay telling you who we think we

are, what do you care?  You see us

as you want to see us...in the

simplest terms and the most

convenient definitions.  You see us

as a brain, an athelete, a basket

case, a princess and a criminal.

Correct?  That's the way we saw each

other at seven o'clock this morning.

We were brainwashed...

CUT TO:

2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY

CLAIRE

I can't believe you can't get me

out of this...I mean it's so absurd

I have to be here on a Saturday!

It's not like I'm a defective or

anything...

CLAIRE'S FATHER

I'll make it up to you...Honey,

ditching class to go shopping

doesn't make you a defective.  Have

a good day.

CUT TO:

3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

BRIAN'S MOTHER

Is this the first time or the last

time we do this?

BRIAN

(upset)

Last...

BRIAN'S MOTHER

Well get in there and use the time

to your advantage...

BRIAN

Mom, we're not supposed to study; we

just have to sit there and do

nothing.

BRIAN'S MOTHER

Well mister you figure out a way to

study.

BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER

(annoyingly)

Yeah!

BRIAN'S MOTHER

Well go!

CUT TO:

4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY

ANDREW'S FATHER

Hey, I screwed around...guys screw

around, there's nothing wrong with

that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

ANDREW

Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?

ANDREW'S FATHER

(angry)

You wanna miss a match?  You wanna

blow your ride?  Now no school's

gonna give a scholarship to a

discipline case.

5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY

CUT TO:

6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

VERNON

Well...well.  Here we are!  I want

to congradulate you for being on

time...

CLAIRE

Excuse me, sir?  I think there's

been a mistake.  I know it's

detention, but...um...I don't think

I belong in here...

VERNON

It is now seven-oh-six.  You have

exactly eight hours and fifty-four

minutes to think about why you're

here.  To ponder the error of your

ways...

VERNON

...and you may not talk.  You will

not move from these seats.

VERNON

...and you...

VERNON

...will not sleep.  Alright people,

we're gonna try something a little

different today.  We are going to

write an essay--of no less than a

thousand words--describing to me

who you think you are.

BENDER

Is this a test?

VERNON

And when I say essay...I mean essay.

I do not mean a single word repeated

a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.

Bender?

BENDER

Crystal...

VERNON

Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little

something about yourself.  Maybe

you'll even--decide whether or not

you care to return.

BRIAN

You know, I can answer that right

now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.

'cause...

VERNON

Sit down Johnson...

BRIAN

Thank you sir...

VERNON

My office...

VERNON

...is right across that hall.  Any

monkey business is ill-advised...

VERNON

...any questions?

BENDER

Yeah...I got a question.

BENDER

Does Barry Manilow know you raid his

wardrobe?

VERNON

I'll give you the answer to that

question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

Don't mess with the bull young man,

you'll get the horns.

BENDER

That man...is a brownie hound...

BENDER

You keep eating your hand and you're

not gonna be hungry for lunch...

BENDER

I've seen you before, you know...

BRIAN

(quietly to himself)

Who do I think I am?  Who are you?

Who are you?

BRIAN

I am a walrus...

BRIAN

It's the shits, huh?

CLAIRE

(to herself)

I can't believe this is really

happening to me...

BENDER

Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do

if we hafta take a piss?

CLAIRE

(disgusted)

Please...

BENDER

If you gotta go...

BENDER

You gotta go!

CLAIRE

(disgusted)

Oh my God!

ANDREW

Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

BENDER

Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes

it crawl back up!

ANDREW

You whip it out and you're dead

before the first drop hits the

floor!

BENDER

You're pretty sexy when you get

angry...grrr!

BENDER

Hey, homeboy...

BENDER

We'll get the prom queen--

impregnated!

ANDREW

Hey!

ANDREW

Hey!

BENDER

ANDREW

If I lose my temper, you're totalled

BENDER

Totally?

ANDREW

CLAIRE

(to Bender)

Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody

here is interested!

ANDREW

Really!

(to Claire about Bender)

Buttface!

BENDER

Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to

get in here?  Forget to wash your

jock?

BRIAN

(nervous)

Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

should just write our papers...

ANDREW

(to Bender)

Look, just because you live in here

doesn't give you the right to be a

pain in the ass...so knock it off!

BENDER

It's a free country...

CLAIRE

(to Andrew)

He's just doing it to get a rise out

of you!  Just ignore him...

BENDER

(to Claire)

Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if

you tried!

BENDER

So...so!

(to Andrew and Claire)

Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-

friend?

(a beat)

Steady dates?

(another beat)

Lo--vers?

(another beat)

Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do

you slip her the hot...beef...

injection?

CLAIRE

(screams)

Go to hell!

ANDREW

(screams)

Enough!

CUT TO:

7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

ANDREW

(to himself)

Scumbag!

BENDER

What do you say we close that door.

We can't have any kind of party

with Vernon checking us out every

few seconds.

BRIAN

Well, you know the door's s'posed to

stay open...

BENDER

So what?

ANDREW

So why don't you just shut up!

There's four other people in here

you know...

BENDER

God, you can count.  See!  I knew

you had to be smart to be a...a

wrestler.

ANDREW

Who the hell are you to judge

anybody anyway?

CLAIRE

Really...

ANDREW

You know, Bender...you don't even

count.  I mean if you disappeared

forever it wouldn't make any

difference.  You may as well not

even exist at this school.

BENDER

Well...I'll just run right out and

join the wrestling team.

BENDER

(to Claire)

Maybe the prep club too!  Student

council...

ANDREW

No, they wouldn't take you.

BENDER

I'm hurt.

CLAIRE

You know why guys like you knock

everything...

BENDER

(to himself)

Oh, this should be stunning...

CLAIRE

It's 'cause you're afraid.

BENDER

(with mock enthusiasm)

Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,

that's exactly why I'm not heavy in

activities!

CLAIRE

You're a big coward!

BRIAN

(to no one imparticular)

I'm in the math club...

CLAIRE

See you're afraid that they won't

take you.  You don't belong so you

just have to dump all over it...

BENDER

Well...it wouldn't have anything to

do with you activities people being

assholes...now would it?

CLAIRE

Well you wouldn't know...You don't

even know any of us.

BENDER

Well, I don't know any lepers

either, but I'm not gonna run out

and join one of their fucking clubs.

ANDREW

Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

BRIAN

I'm in the physics club too...

BENDER

(to Claire)

S'cuse me a sec...

(to Brian)

What are you babbling about?

BRIAN

Well, what I said was...I'm in the

math club, the Latin club and the

physics club...physics club.

BENDER

Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the

physics club?

CLAIRE

That's an academic club...

BENDER

So?

CLAIRE

So...academic clubs aren't the same

as other kinds of clubs.

BENDER

Oh, but to dorks like him...

BENDER

...they are.

(to Brian)

What do you guys do in your club?

BRIAN

In physics, um, we ah, we talk about

physics...about properties of physics.

BENDER

So it's sorta social...demented and

sad, but social.  Right?

BRIAN

Yeah, well, I guess you could

consider it a social situation.  I

mean there are other children in my

club and uh, at the end of the year

we have, um, you know, a big

banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

BENDER

You load up, you party...

BRIAN

Well, no, we get dressed up...I

mean, but, we don't...we don't get

high.

CLAIRE

(to Bender)

Only burners like you get high...

BRIAN

And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.

So I had to borrow my dad's.  It

was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't

like me to wear other people's

shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my

cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...

He got high once and you know, he

started eating like really weird

foods.  And uh, and then he just

felt like he didn't belong anywhere.

You know, kinda like, you know

"Twilight Zone" kinda.

CLAIRE

(laughs)

(to Bender)

Sounds like you...

ANDREW

Look, you guys keep up your talking

and Vernon's gonna come right in

here...I got a meet this Saturday

and I'm not gonna miss it on account

of you boneheads...

BENDER

(to Andrew)

Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

BENDER

Missing a whole wrestling meet!

ANDREW

Well you wouldn't know anything

about it, faggot!  You never competed

in your whole life!

BENDER

(with mock hurt)

Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside

because of it.  I have such a deep

admiration for guys that roll around

on the floor with other guys!

ANDREW

Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You

don't have any goals.

BENDER

Oh, but I do!

ANDREW

Yeah?

BENDER

I wanna be just--like--you!  I

figure all I need's a labotamy and

some tights!

BRIAN

You wear tights?

ANDREW

(to Brian)

No I don't wear tights, I wear the

required uniform...

BRIAN

Tights...

ANDREW

(defensive)

Shut up!

BRIAN

You know there's not s'posed to be

any monkey business!

BENDER

(in a stern voice)

Young man...have you finished your

paper?

CLAIRE

What are you gonna do?

ANDREW

Drop dead, I hope!

CUT TO:

9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

CUT TO:

10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

BRIAN

Bender, that's, that's school

property there...you know, it doesn't

belong to us.  It's something not to

be toyed with.

ANDREW

That's very funny, come on, fix it!

BRIAN

You should really fix that!

BENDER

Am I a genius?

ANDREW

No, you're an asshole!

BENDER

What a funny guy!

ANDREW

Fix the door Bender!

BENDER

Everyone just shhh!

CUT TO:

11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

BENDER (OS)

I've been here before, I know what

I'm doing!

ANDREW (OS)

No!  Fix the door, get up there and

fix it!

BENDER (OS)

(screams)

Shut up!

CUT TO:

12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

VERNON (OS)

God damnit!

VERNON

Why is that door closed?

VERNON

Why is that door closed?

BENDER

How're we s'posed to know?  We're

not s'posed to move, right?

VERNON

Why?

CLAIRE

We were just sitting here, like we

were s'posed to...

VERNON

Who closed that door?

BENDER

I think a screw fell out of it...

ANDREW

It just closed, sir...

VERNON

Who?

BENDER

She doesn't talk, sir...

VERNON

(to Bender)

Give me that screw...

BENDER

I don't have it...

VERNON

You want me to yank you outta that

seat and shake it out of you?

BENDER

I don't have it...screws fall out

all of the time, the world's an

imperfect place...

VERNON

Give it to me, Bender...

CLAIRE

Excuse me, sir, why would anybody

want to steal a screw?

VERNON

(to Claire)

Watch it, young lady...

BENDER

The door's way too heavy, sir.

VERNON (OS)

God damnit!

VERNON

(pointing)

Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,

front and center, let's go.

BENDER

Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?

If he gets up, we'll all get up,

it'll be anarchy!

VERNON

Okay, now, watch the magazines!

BENDER

It's out of my hands...

BENDER

That's very clever sir, but what if

there's a fire?  I think violating

fire codes and endangering the

lives of children would be unwise

at this juncture in your career, sir.

VERNON

Alright, what are you doing with

this?  Get this outta here for God's

sake!  What's the matter with you?

Come on!

BRIAN

You know the school comes equipped

with fire exits at either end of the

library.

BENDER

(to Brian)

Show Dick some respect!

VERNON

(to Andrew)

Let's go...go!  Get back into your

seat.

VERNON

(to Andrew)

I expected a little more from a

varsity letterman!

(to Bender)

You're not fooling anybody, Bender!

The next screw that falls out is

gonna be you!

BENDER

(under his breath)

Eat my shorts...

VERNON

What was that?

BENDER

(loudly)

Eat my shorts!

VERNON

You just bought yourself another

Saturday, mister!

BENDER

Oh, Christ...

VERNON

You just bought one more right

there!

BENDER

Well, I'm free the Saturday after

that...beyond that, I'm gonna have

to check my calendar!

VERNON

Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled,

we'll keep goin'!  You want another

one?  Say the word, just say the

word!  Instead of going to prison,

you'll come here!  Are you through.

BENDER

No!

VERNON

I'm doing society a favor!

BENDER

So?

VERNON

That's another one, right now!  I've

got you for the rest of your natural

born life if you don't watch your

step!  You want another one?

BENDER

Yes!

VERNON

You got it!  You got another one,

right there!  That's another one

pal!

CLAIRE

(worried)

Cut it out!

VERNON

You through?

BENDER

Not even close, bud!

VERNON

Good!  You got one more, right

there!

BENDER

Do you really think I give a shit?

VERNON

Another...

VERNON

You through?

BENDER

How many is that?

BRIAN

That's seven including the one when

we first came in and you asked Mr.

Vernon here whether Barry Manilow

knew that he raided his closet.

VERNON

(to Bender)

Now it's eight...

(to Brian)

You stay out of it!

BRIAN

Excuse me, sir, it's seven!

VERNON

Shut up, Peewee!

(to Bender)

You're mine Bender...for two months

I gotcha!  I gotcha!

BENDER

What can I say?  I'm thrilled!

VERNON

Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you

want these people to believe.  You

know something, Bender?  You ought

to spend a little more time trying

to do something with yourself and a

little less time trying to impress

people.  You might be better off.

(to everyone)

Alright, that's it!  I'm going to

be right outside those doors.  The

next time I hafta come in here...I'm

cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths Im

cracking skulls)

BENDER

(screams)

Fuck you!

CUT TO:

13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

VERNON

Wake up!  Who has to go to the

lavatory?

CUT TO:

14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

ANDREW

That's real intelligent.

BENDER

You're right...it's wrong to

destroy literature...

BENDER

It's such fun to read...and, Molet

really pumps my nads!

CLAIRE

(pronouncing it correctly)

Mol-yare.

BRIAN

I love his work.

BENDER

Big deal...nothing to do when you're

locked in a vacancy..

ANDREW

Speak for yourself...

BENDER

Do you think I'd speak for you?  I

don't even know your language!

ANDREW

Hey, you grounded tonight?

CLAIRE

I don't know, my mom said I was but

by dad told me to just blow her off.

ANDREW

Big party at Stubbies, parents are

in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

CLAIRE

Yeah?

ANDREW

Yeah, can you go?

CLAIRE

I doubt it...

ANDREW

How come?

CLAIRE

Well 'cause if I do what my mother

tells me not to do, it's because

because my father says it's okay.

There's like this whole big monster

deal, it's endless and it's a total

drag.  It's like any minute...

divorce...

BENDER

Who do you like better?

CLAIRE

What?

BENDER

You like your old man better than

your mom?

CLAIRE

They're both strict.

BENDER

No, I mean, if you had to choose

between them.

CLAIRE

I dunno, I'd probably go live with

my brother.  I mean, I don't think

either one of them gives a shit

about me...it's like they use me

just to get back at each other.

ALLISON

(loudly)

Ha!!!

CLAIRE

Shut up!

ANDREW

You're just feeling sorry for

yourself...

CLAIRE

Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else

would.

ANDREW

Aw...you're breaking my heart...

BENDER

Sporto...

ANDREW

What?

BENDER

You get along with your parents?

ANDREW

Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,

right?

BENDER

You're an idiot anyway...But if you

say you get along with your parents

well you're a liar too!

ANDREW

You know something, man...If we

weren't in school right now, I'd

waste you!

BENDER

Can you hear this?  Want me to turn

it up?

BRIAN

Hey fellas, I mean...

BRIAN

...I don't like my parents either,

I don't...I don't get along with

them...their idea of parental

compassion is just, you know, wacko!

BENDER

Dork...

BRIAN

Yeah?

BENDER

You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

BRIAN

Well that's a problem!

BENDER

Look, I can see you getting all

bunged up for them making you wear

these kinda clothes.  But face it,

you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!

What would you be doing if you

weren't out making yourself a better

citizen?

ANDREW

Why do you have to insult everybody?

BENDER

I'm being honest, asshole!  I would

expect you...to know the difference!

ANDREW

Yeah well, he's gotta name!

BENDER

Yeah?

ANDREW

Yeah,

(to Brian)

What's your name?

BRIAN

Brian...

ANDREW

See...

BENDER

(to Brian)

My condolences...

CLAIRE

(to Bender)

What's your name?

BENDER

What's yours?

CLAIRE

Claire...

BENDER

Ka-Laire?

CLAIRE

Claire...it's a family name!

BENDER

Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

CLAIRE

Well thank you...

BENDER

You're welcome...

CLAIRE

I'm not fat!

BENDER

Well not at present but I could see

you really pushing maximum density!

You see, I'm not sure if you know

this...but there are two kinds of

fat people.  There's fat people that

were born to be fat, and then there's

fat people that were once thin but

they became fat...so when you look

at them you can sorta see that thin

person inside!  You see, you're

gonna get married, you're gonna

squeeze out a few puppies and then,

uh...

BENDER

Oh...obscene finger gestures from

such a pristine girl!

CLAIRE

(resentfully)

I'm not that pristine!

BENDER

Are you a virgin?

(a beat)

I'll bet you a million dollars that

you are!  Let's end the suspense!

Is it gonna be...

(another beat)

...a white weddin?

CLAIRE

Why don't you just shut up?

BENDER

Have you ever kissed a boy on the

mouth?

(a beat)

Have you ever been felt up?  Over

the bra, under the blouse, shoes

off...hoping to God your parents

don't walk in?

CLAIRE

Do you want me to puke?

BENDER

Over the panties, no bra, blouse

unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on

the front seat past eleven on a

school night?

ANDREW

Leave her alone!

ANDREW

I said leave her alone!

BENDER

You gonna make me?

ANDREW

Yeah...

BENDER

You and how many of your friends?

ANDREW

Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.

Me hitting you, you hitting the

floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

BENDER

I don't wanna get into to this with

you man...

ANDREW

Why not?

BENDER

'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.

I'd kill you and your fucking parents

would sue me and it would be a big

mess and I don't care enough about

you to bother.

ANDREW

Chicken shit...

ANDREW

Let's end this right now.  You don't

talk to her...you don't look at her

and you don't even think about her!

You understand me?

BENDER

I'm trying to help her!.

CARL

Brian, how you doing?

BENDER

Your dad works here?

BENDER

Uh, Carl?

CARL

What?

BENDER

Can I ask you a question?

CARL

Sure...

BENDER

How does one become a janitor?

CARL

You wanna be a janitor?

BENDER

No I just wanna know how one becomes

a janitor because Andrew here, is

very interested in persuing a

career in the custodial arts...

CARL

Oh, really?  You guys think I'm

just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?

Huh?  Maybe so, but following

a broom around after shitheads like

you for the past eight years I've

learned a couple of things...I look

through your letters, I look through

your lockers...I listen to your

conversations, you don't know that

but I do...I am the eyes and ears of

this institution my friends.  By the

way, that clock's twenty minutes

fast!

ANDREW

Shit!

VERNON

Allright girls, that's thirty

minutes for lunch...

ANDREW

VERNON

ANDREW

Well I think the cafeteria would be

a more suitable place for us to eat

lunch in, sir!

VERNON

Well, I don't care what you think,

Andrew!

BENDER

Uh, Dick?  Excuse me, Rich...will

milk be made available to us?

ANDREW

We're extremely thirsty sir...

CLAIRE

I have a very low tolerance for

dehydration.

ANDREW

I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's

pretty gross.

BENDER

Relax, I'll get it!

VERNON

Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!

VERNON

What do you think, I was born

yesterday?  You think I'm gonna

have you roaming these halls?

VERNON

You!

VERNON

And you!  Hey!  What's her name?

Wake her!  Wake her up!

Come on, on your feet missy!  Let's

So, what's your poison?

ANDREW

What do you drink?

ANDREW

Okay...forget I asked...

ALLISON

Vodka...

ANDREW

Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?

ALLISON

Whenever...

ANDREW

A lot?

ALLISON

Tons...

ANDREW

Is that why you're here today?

ANDREW

Why are you here?

ALLISON

Why are you here?

ANDREW

Um, I'm here today...because uh,

because my coach and my father don't

want me to blow my ride.  See I get

treated differently because uh,

Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does

my old man.  I'm not a winner

because I wanna be one... I'm a

winner because I got strength and

speed.  Kinda like a race horse.

That's about how involved I am in

what's happening to me.

ALLISON

Yeah?  That's very interesting.

Now why don't you tell me why you're

really in here.

ANDREW

Forget it!

CUT TO:

17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

BENDER

Claire...you wanna see a picture of

a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?

It's pretty tasty...

CLAIRE

No thank you...

BENDER

How do you think he rides a bike?

BENDER

Oh, Claire...would you ever consider

dating a guy like this?

CLAIRE

Can't you just leave me alone?

BENDER

I mean if he had a great personality

and was a good dancer and had a cool

car...Although you'd probably have

to ride in the back seat 'cause his

nuts would ride shotgun.

CLAIRE

You know what I wish I was doing?

BENDER

Op, watch what you say, Brian here

is a cherry.

BRIAN

A cherry?

CLAIRE

I wish I was on a plane to France.

BRIAN

I'm not a cherry.

BENDER

(to Brian)

When have you ever gotten laid?

BRIAN

I've laid, lotsa times!

BENDER

Name one!

BRIAN

No I'm not!  I'm not!  John said I

BENDER

Well then what were you motioning to

Claire for?

CLAIRE

You know I don't appreciate this

very much, Brian.

BRIAN

He is lying!

BENDER

Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?

BRIAN

You know he's lying, right?

BENDER

Were you or were you not motioning

to Claire?

BRIAN

Yeah, but it was only...was only

because I didn't want her to know

that I was a virgin, okay?

BRIAN

Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm

sorry...

CLAIRE

Why didn't you want me to know you

were a virgin?

BRIAN

Because it's personal business, it's

my personal, private business.

BENDER

Well Brian, it doesn't sound like

you're doing any business...

CLAIRE

I think it's okay for a guy to be a

virgin...

construed as rape since I paid him.

gross that is?

you're a prude.  If you say you

have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.

You want to but you can't but when

you do you wish you didn't, right?

Wrong...

Or, are you a tease?

She's a tease...

That's why you're a tease...

Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.

I've already told you everything!

CLAIRE

No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

around without being in love.  I

mean don't you want any respect?

ALLISON

I don't screw to get respect...That's

the difference between you and me...

CLAIRE

Not the only difference, I hope.

Face it, you're a tease.

CLAIRE

I'm not a tease!

BENDER

Sure you are!  You said it yourself

sex is a weapon, you use it to get

respect!

CLAIRE

No, I never said that, she twisted

my words around.

BENDER

Oh then what do you use it for?

CLAIRE

I don't use it period!

BENDER

Oh, are you medically frigid or is

it psychological?

CLAIRE

I didn't mean it that way!  You guys

are putting words into my mouth!

question...

No!  I never did it!

ALLISON

I never did it either, I'm not a

nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive

liar...

CLAIRE

You are such a bitch!  You did that

on purpose just to fuck me over!

ALLISON

I would do it though...If you love

someone it's okay...

CLAIRE

I can't believe you, you're so

weird.  You don't say anything all

day and then when you open your

mouth...you unload all these

tremendous lies all over me!

ANDREW

You're just pissed off because she

got you to admit something you didn't

want to admit to...

CLAIRE

Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it

any less bizarre...

ANDREW

What's bizarre?  I mean we're all

pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just

better at hiding it, that's all.

CLAIRE

(to Andrew)

How are you bizarre?

ALLISON

He can't think for himself...

ANDREW

She's right...do you guys know what,

uh, what I did to get in here?  I

taped Larry Lester's buns together.

BRIAN

(to Andrew)

That was you?

ANDREW

(to Brian)

Yeah, you know him?

BRIAN

Yeah, I know him...

ANDREW

Well then you know how hairy he is,

right?  Well, when they pulled the

tape off, most of his hair came off

and some, some skin too...

CLAIRE

Oh my God...

ANDREW

And the bizarre thing is, is that

I did it for my old man...I

tortured this poor kid, because I

wanted him to think that I was cool.

He's always going off about, you

know, when he was in school...all

the wild things he used to do.  And

I got the feeling that he was

disappointed that I never cut loose

on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm

sitting in the locker room, and I'm

taping up my knee.  And Larry's

undressing a couple lockers down

from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...

he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I

started thinking about my father,

and his attitude about weakness.

And the next thing I knew, I uh, I

jumped on top of him and started

wailing on him...And my friends,

they just laughed and cheered me on.

And afterwards, when I was sittin'

in Vernon's office, all I could

think about was Larry's father. And

Larry havin' to go home and...and

explain what happened to him.  And

the humiliation...fucking

humiliation he mustuv felt.  It

mustuv been unreal...I mean,

(he's crying)

I mean, how do you apologize for

something like that?  There's no

way...it's all because of me and

my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate

him!  He's like this...he's like

this mindless machine that I can't

even relate to anymore..."Andrew,

you've got to be number one!  I

won't tolerate any losers in this

family...Your intensity is for shit!

Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a

bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish

my knee would give...and I wouldn't

be able to wrestle anymore.  And he

could forget all about me...

BENDER

I think your old man and my old man

should get together and go bowling.

BRIAN

It's like me, you know, with my

grades...like, when I, when I

step outside myself kinda, and

when I, when I look in at myself

you know?  And I see me and I don't

like what I see, I really don't.

CLAIRE

What's wrong with you?  Why don't

you like yourself?

BRIAN

'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing

shop.  See we had this assignment,

to make this ceramic elephant, and

um...and we had eight weeks to do

it and we're s'posed ta, and it was

like a lamp, and when you pull the

trunk the light was s'posed to go

on...my light didn't go on, I got a

F on it.  Never got a F in my life...

When I signed up, you know, for the

course I mean.  I thought I was

playing it real smart, you know.

'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,

it'll be such an easy way to

maintain my grade point average...

BENDER

Why'd you think it'd be easy?

BRIAN

Have you seen some of the dopes that

take shop?

BENDER

I take shop...you must be a fuckin'

idiot!

BRIAN

I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't

make a lamp?

BENDER

No, you're a genius because you

can't make a lamp...

BRIAN

What do you know about Trigonometry?

BENDER

I could care less about

Trigonometry...

BRIAN

Bender, did you know without

Trigonometry there'd be no

engineering?

BENDER

Without lamps, there'd be no light!

CLAIRE

Okay so neither one of you is any

better than the other one...

ALLISON

I can write with my toes!  I can

also eat, brush my teeth...

CLAIRE

With your feet?

ALLISON

...play Heart & Soul on the piano.

BRIAN

I can make spaghetti!

CLAIRE

(to Andrew)

What can you do?

ANDREW

I can...uh...tape all your buns

together...

BENDER

I wanna see what Claire can do!

CLAIRE

I can't do anything.

BENDER

Now, everybody can do something...

CLAIRE

There's one thing I can do, no

forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

BENDER

You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean

that guy's been doing that show for

thirty years.

CLAIRE

Okay, but you have to swear to God

you won't laugh...I can't believe

I'm actually doing this...

Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

ANDREW

All right, great!  Where'd you learn

to do that?

CLAIRE

Camp, seventh grade...

BENDER

That was great, Claire...my image of

you is totally blown...

ALLISON

You're a shit!  Don't do that to her

you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!

BENDER

Am I laughing?

ANDREW

You fucking prick!

BENDER

What do you care what I think,

anyway?  I don't even count, right?

I could disappear forever and it

wouldn't make any difference...I may

as well not even exist at this

school, remember?

(he turns to Claire)

And you...don't like me anyway!

CLAIRE

You know, I have just as many

feelings as you do and it hurts

just as much when somebody steps

all over them!

BENDER

God, you're so pathetic!

(furious)

Don't you ever...ever!  Compare

yourself to me!  Okay?  You got

everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'

Rapunzel, right?  School would

probably fucking shut down if you

didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't

here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

CLAIRE

(quietly)

Shut up...

BENDER

Are those real diamonds, Claire?

CLAIRE

(angry)

Shut up!

BENDER                       CLAIRE

I bet they are...did you

work, for the money               Shut...

for those earrings?                   Your mouth!

BENDER

Or did your daddy buy those?

CLAIRE

(furious)

Shut up!

BENDER

I bet he bought those for you!  I

bet those are a Christmas gift!

Right?  You know what I got for

Christmas this year?  It was a

banner fuckin' year at the old

Bender family!  I got a carton of

cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me

and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"

Okay, so go home'n cry to your

daddy, don't cry here, okay?

ANDREW

My God, are we gonna be like our

parents?

CLAIRE

Not me...ever...

ALLISON

It's unavoidable, it just happens.

CLAIRE

What happens?

ALLISON

When you grow up, your heart dies.

BENDER

Who cares?

ALLISON

I care...

BRIAN

Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I

know it's kind of a weird time, but

I was just wondering, um, what is

gonna happen to us on Monday?  When

we're all together again?  I mean I

consider you guys my friends, I'm

not wrong, am I?

ANDREW

No...

BRIAN

So, so on Monday...what happens?

CLAIRE

Are we still friends, you mean?

If we're friends now, that is?

BRIAN

Yeah...

CLAIRE

Do you want the truth?

BRIAN

Yeah, I want the truth...

CLAIRE

I don't think so...

ALLISON

Well, do you mean all of us or just

John?

CLAIRE

With all of you...

ANDREW

That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

CLAIRE

Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came

walking up to you in the hall on

Monday, what would you do?  I mean

picture this, you're there with all

the sports.  I know exactly what

you'd do, you'd say hi to him and

when he left you'd cut him all up

so your friends wouldn't think you

really liked him!

ANDREW

No way!

ALLISON

'Kay, what if I came up to you?

CLAIRE

Same exact thing!

BENDER

(furious and screaming at Claire)

You are a bitch!

CLAIRE

Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,

that makes me a bitch?

BENDER

No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

is to do to someone!  And you don't

got the balls to stand up to your

friends and tell 'em that you're

gonna like who you wanna like!

CLAIRE

Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!

Why don't you take Allison to one of

your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or

take Brian out to the parking lot at

lunch to get high?  What about Andy

for that matter, what about me?

What would your friends say if we

were walking down the hall together.

They'd laugh their asses off and

you'd probably tell them you were

doing it with me so they'd forgive

you for being seen with me.

BENDER

(furious once again)

Don't you ever talk about my

friends!  You don't know any of my

friends, you don't look at any of my

friends and you certainly wouldn't

condescend to speak to any of my

friends so you just stick to the

things you know, shopping, nail

polish, your father's BMW and your

poor--rich--drunk mother in the

Carribean!

CLAIRE

(furious and sobbing)

Shut up!

BENDER

And as far as being concerned about

what's gonna happen when you and I

walk down the hallways at school,

you can forget it!  'Cause it's never

gonna happen!  Just bury your head

in the sand...and wait for your

fuckin' prom!

CLAIRE

I hate you!

BENDER

Yeah?  Good!

BRIAN

Then I assume Allison and I are

better people than you guys, huh?

Us weirdos...

(to Allison)

Do you, would you do that to me?

ALLISON

I don't have any friends...

BRIAN

Well if you did?

ALLISON

No...I don't think the kind of

friends I'd have would mind...

BRIAN

I just wanna tell, each of you,

that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't

and I will not!  'Cause I think that's

real shitty...

CLAIRE

Your friends wouldn't mind because

they look up to us...

BRIAN

You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

so conceited.  You're so, like, full

of yourself, why are you like that?

CLAIRE

(crying again)

I'm not saying that to be conceited!

I hate it!  I hate having to go

along with everything my friends say!

BRIAN

Well then why do you do it?

CLAIRE

I don't know, I don't...you don't

understand..you don't.  You're not

friends with the same kind of people

that Andy and I are friends with!

You know, you just don't understand

the pressure that they can put on

you!

BRIAN

I don't understand what?  You think

I don't understand pressure, Claire?

Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

BRIAN

Know why I'm here today?  Do you?

I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a

gun in the locker...

ANDREW

Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

BRIAN

I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

on it and the light's s'posed to go

on...and it didn't go on, I mean,

I...

ANDREW

What's the gun for Brian?

BRIAN

Just forget it...

ANDREW

You brought it up, man!

BRIAN

I can't have an F, I can't have it

and I know my parents can't have it!

Even if I aced the rest of the

semester, I'm still only a B.  And

everything's ruined for me!

CLAIRE

(with pity)

Oh Brian...

BRIAN

So I considered my options, you

know?

CLAIRE

No!  Killing yourself is not an

option!

BRIAN

Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

don't think so!

ALLISON

It was a hand gun?

BRIAN

No, it was a flare gun, went off

in my locker.

ANDREW

Really?

BRIAN

It's not funny...

BRIAN

Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

destroyed!

ALLISON

You wanna know what I did to get in

here?  Nothing...I didn't have

anything better to do.

ALLISON

You're laughing at me...

ANDREW

No!

ALLISON

Yeah you are!

Are you gonna write your paper?

BRIAN

CLAIRE

Well, it's kinda a waste for all of

us to write our paper, don't you

think?

BRIAN

Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us

to do...

CLAIRE

True, but I think we'd all kinda

say the same thing.

BRIAN

You just don't want to write your

paper...Right?

CLAIRE

True, but, you're the smartest,

right?

BRIAN

Oh, well...

CLAIRE

ALLISON

Don't stick that in my eye!

CLAIRE

I'm not sticking it, just close...

just go like that...

CLAIRE

Good...

CLAIRE

You know you really do look a lot

better without all that black shit

on your eyes...

ALLISON

Hey...I like that black shit...

CLAIRE

This looks a lot better...look up.

ALLISON

CLAIRE

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact

that we had to sacrifice a whole

Saturday in detention for whatever

it was we did wrong.  But we think

you're crazy to make an essay

telling you who we think we are.

You see us as you want to see us...

In the simplest terms, in the most

convenient definitions.
