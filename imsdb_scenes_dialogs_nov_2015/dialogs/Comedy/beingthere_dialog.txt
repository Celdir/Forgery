Being There - December 16, 1978 Draft

LOUISE

(sets dinner before

Chance)

... Evening, Chance.

CHANCE

(slowly, perfect diction,

no accent of any kind)

... Good evening, Louise.

LOUISE

... The Old Man is getting weaker,

Chance.

CHANCE

(begins to eat)

I see.

LOUISE

I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with

every hour that goes by...

LOUISE (CONT'D)

... Back up those stairs - damn...

That Man's needin' me more and more

just before he never needs me

again...

CHANCE

(still watches TV)

Is his back feeling better?

LOUISE

... Gobbledegook... You and your

gobbledegook. You're gonna be the

death of me yet, Chance...

(she turns to leave)

... Unless those stairs are... The

Good Lord's liable to snatch up two

unwillin' souls at the same time if

I keep on trampin' up those

stairs... I don't want none of

that...

CHANCE

Good morning, Louise.

LOUISE

(out of breath)

He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's

dead!

CHANCE

(flatly, turns back to TV)

... I see.

LOUISE

Must of happened durin' the night,

I don't know... Lord, he wasn't

breathin' and as cold as a fish. I

touched him, just to see, and you

believe me, Chance - that's doin'

more than I get paid to do... Then

I just covered him up, pulled the

sheet over his head...

CHANCE

(nodding)

Yes. I've seen that done.

LOUISE

Then I got the hell out of that

room and called the doctor and I

think I woke him probably, he

wasn't any too alert. He just said,

'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and

said he'd send somebody over...'

Lord, what a mornin'!

CHANCE

(watches news, flashes of

season's first snowfall)

... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in

the garden today. Have you looked

outside and seen the snow? It's

very white.

LOUISE

Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to

say? More gobbledegook?

(Chance smiles, is silent)

That Old Man's layin' up there dead

as hell and it just don't make any

difference to you!

CHANCE

(with a smile, accepting

death)

Yes, Louise. I have seen it often.

It happens to old people.

LOUISE

Well, ain't that the truth...

CHANCE

Yes. It is.

LOUISE

Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know

what I was expectin' from you...

I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...

No sir, I just don't know what I

was expectin' ...

(Chance doesn't react,

watches TV)

... I 'spose I'd better gather up

some breakfast for you...

CHANCE

(a turn to her)

Yes, I'm very hungry.

LOUISE

(rises, looks upstairs)

Well, no more stewin' those prunes

every mornin', that's somethin', I

guess...

(she starts out, stops by

the door)

... what are you goin' to do now,

Chance?

CHANCE

(gazing at TV)

I'm going to work in the garden.

LOUISE

(as she goes)

... I'll get you some eggs.

LOUISE

... Well, ain't you the gentleman

this mornin'...

(a pause)

... gotta go now, Chance...

CHANCE

(resumes working)

Yes.

LOUISE

You're gonna need somebody,

someone's gotta be around for you,

boy...

(he keeps working)

... You oughta find yourself a

lady, Chance...

(she smiles slightly, with

caring)

But I guess it oughta be an old

lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a

young one any good, not with that

little thing of yours...

(she reaches out, puts a

hand on his shoulder)

... You're always gonna be a little

boy, ain't you?

(he smiles, keeps working)

... Goodbye, Chance...

CHANCE

(as she goes)

Goodbye, Louise.

LOUISE

... He used to be a big man...

'Spose he wasted away to about

nothin'...

(a beat - then she talks

to the body of the old

Man)

... I guess I'll be goin' off to

find me some folks, Old Man... I'm

not batty enough to stay around

this neighborhood any longer...

LOUISE (CONT'D)

(to stretcher bearers)

Wait up! I'm goin' out that door

first.

HAYES

(looks around)

... This is another world, Tom - I

never would have believed it...

FRANKLIN

Yeah... He and my father used to

ride together back in the

thirties... Fox hunting... Before I

was born...

HAYES

... Would you take me on a tour?

FRANKLIN

Gladly...

(he smiles)

... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'

bedroom, that'll be stop number

one.

FRANKLIN

... Why... Hello, we thought we

heard something...

(moves to Chance, hand

outstretched)

I'm Thomas Franklin.

CHANCE

Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the

gardener.

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

... The gardener?

(thinks it's a joke,

laughs)

... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,

this is Ms. Hayes.

HAYES

Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to

meet you.

CHANCE

(doesn't rise, again

shakes with both hands)

Yes.

FRANKLIN

(after an uneasy pause)

... We're with Franklin, Jennings

and Roberts, the law firm handling

the estate.

CHANCE

(a smile, totally at ease)

Yes, Thomas - I understand.

FRANKLIN

... Are you waiting for someone? An

appointment?

CHANCE

Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

FRANKLIN

Your lunch? You have a luncheon

appointment here?

CHANCE

Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

FRANKLIN

Louise?... The maid?...

(a look to Hayes)

But she should have left earlier

today...

CHANCE

(smiles at Hayes)

I see...

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

... You've quite a sense of humor,

Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside,

may I ask just what you are doing

here?

CHANCE

I live here.

FRANKLIN

You live here?

(a look to Hayes)

... We don't have any record of

that.

CHANCE

Yes. It's very cold outside today,

isn't it, Thomas?

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

... How long have you been living

here?

CHANCE

Ever since I can remember, since I

was a child.

FRANKLIN

(doubting)

Since you were a child?

CHANCE

Yes, Thomas. I have always been

here. I have always worked in the

garden.

HAYES

... Then you really are a gardener?

CHANCE

Yes.

HAYES

Your appearance doesn't suggest

that at all, Mr. Chance.

CHANCE

Oh. Thank you.

FRANKLIN

Do you have any proof of your

employment, Mr. Chance - any checks

from the deceased, any contracts or

documents?

CHANCE

No.

FRANKLIN

How were you compensated for these

duties you say you performed?

CHANCE

Compensated...?

FRANKLIN

How were you paid?

CHANCE

I was given meals, and a home...

HAYES

What about money?

CHANCE

I never needed money.

FRANKLIN

Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show

us some identification with your

address -- a Driver's License, a

credit card, checkbook?

CHANCE

No, I do not have any of those.

FRANKLIN

Then how about medical records?

Could you give us the name of your

doctor, or your dentist?

CHANCE

I have no need for a doctor or

dentist. I have never been ill. I

have never been allowed outside of

this house, and, except for Joe, I

have never had any visitors.

FRANKLIN

... Joe? Who's Joe?

CHANCE

(turns TV back on)

Joe Saracini. He was a mason that

did some repairs on the brickwork

at the rear of the house. That was

in 1952.

FRANKLIN

1952...?

CHANCE

(changes channels)

Yes. I remember when he came. He

was very fat and had short hair and

showed me some pictures from a

funny little book.

HAYES

Some pictures...?

CHANCE

Yes. Of men and women.

HAYES

... Oh.

FRANKLIN

Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven

years ago.

CHANCE

Yes and the Old Man used to come to

my garden. He would read and rest

there.

FRANKLIN

Come now, Mr. Jennings had been

bedridden for thirty-five years,

since he fractured his spine.

CHANCE

Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then

he stopped visiting my garden.

FRANKLIN

(a beat)

... We shall need some proof of

your having resided here, Mr.

Chance.

CHANCE

You have me, I am here. What more

proof do you need?

FRANKLIN

Have you served in the Army?

CHANCE

No, Thomas. But I have seen the

Army on television.

HAYES

How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely

you must have paid taxes?

CHANCE

No.

CHANCE

(points)

Those trees were very young when I

first arrived.

FRANKLIN

Are you related to the deceased,

Mr. Chance?

CHANCE

No, I don't think so. And I have

planted and shaped all the hedges,

and in the springtime you will be

able to see my flowers.

HAYES

Might you have a birth certificate,

Mr. Chance?

CHANCE

No.

(points to wall)

That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

FRANKLIN

(admires car)

... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

CHANCE

No, Thomas. I have never been in an

automobile.

HAYES

(amazed)

You never been in a car?

CHANCE

... Well... From time to time I did

sit in it... Just in here... It

hasn't been outside since the Old

Man hurt himself.

(he turns)

I live in here.

CHANCE

The Old Man gave me nice television

sets, this one has remote control.

(he turns it on with the

remote)

He has one just like it.

FRANKLIN

Mr. Chance, the fact remains that

we have no information of your

having any connection with the

deceased.

CHANCE

Yes, I understand.

CHANCE

I am allowed to go to the attic and

select any of the Old Man's suits.

They all fit me very well. I can

also take his shirts, shoes and

coats.

HAYES

It is quite amazing how those

clothes have come back into style.

CHANCE

Yes. I have seen styles on

television.

FRANKLIN

(getting back to business)

What are your plans now, Mr.

Chance?

CHANCE

I would like to stay and work in my

garden.

FRANKLIN

(quietly)

... What do you make of all this?

HAYES

I really don't know, Tom - he seems

so honest and simple... In a way,

he's quite charming...

FRANKLIN

(looks at Chance)

... Yeah...

HAYES

... It's very bizarre - I don't

know what to think...

FRANKLIN

Well... He's either very, very

bright or very, very dense - he's

hard to figure...

(he unzips briefcase)

... Let's just keep everything

legal.

FRANKLIN

Mr. Chance, assuming what you say

is the truth, I would like to know

what sort of claim you are planning

to make against the deceased's

estate.

CHANCE

(does not understand)

I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a

healthy one. There is no need for a

claim.

FRANKLIN

Good. That's good. Then if you

would please sign a paper to that

effect.

CHANCE

No, Thomas. I don't know how to

sign.

FRANKLIN

Come now, Mr. Chance.

CHANCE

(smiles)

I have no claim, Thomas.

FRANKLIN

But you won't sign, correct?

CHANCE

Correct.

FRANKLIN

Very well, Mr. Chance - if you

insist on dragging this matter

on... But I must inform you this

house will be closed tomorrow at

noon. If indeed, you do reside

here, you will have to move out.

CHANCE

Move out? I don't understand,

Thomas.

FRANKLIN

I think you do, Mr. Chance.

However, I will reiterate, this

house is closed and you must

leave...

(he gives Chance his

business card)

Call me if you change your mind

about signing.

(turns to Hayes)

C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

HAYES

(a smile to Chance)

Good day, Mr. Chance.

CHANCE

(returns smile)

Good day, Sally.

CHANCE

(friendly)

... Excuse me, would you please

tell me where I could find a garden

to work in?

CHANCE (CONT'D)

(after a beat)

... There is much to be done during

the winter, I must start the seeds

for the spring, I must work the

soil...

LOLO

What you growin', man?

ABBAZ

(nose to nose with Chance)

... What you doin' here, boy?

CHANCE

I had to leave my garden. I want to

find another.

ABBAZ

Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy?

Did that chickenshit asshole

Raphael send you here, boy?

CHANCE

No. Thomas Franklin told me that I

had to leave the Old Man's house,

he's dead now, you know...

ABBAZ

Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie -

you go tell Raphael that I ain't

takin' no jive from no Western

Union messenger! You tell that

asshole, if he got somethin' to

tell me to get his ass here

himself!

(edges closer to Chance)

You got that, boy?

CHANCE

Yes. I understand.

(he takes out his remote

control TV changer)

If I see Raphael I will tell him.

ABBAZ

(holds knife at Chance)

Now, move, honkie! Before I cut

your white ass!

CHANCE

Yes. Of course.

(as he leaves)

Good day.

CHANCE

I'm very hungry now. Would you

please bring me my lunch?

CHANCE

I have seen your game! I have

watched Elvin Hayes play it many

times! They call him "Big E!"

CHANCE

Excuse me...

(points to tree)

... That tree is very sick. It

should be cared for.

POLICEMAN

Yes sir. I'll report it right away.

CHANCE

Yes. That would be a good thing to

do. Good day.

POLICEMAN

Good day.

DAVID

I'm very sorry, sir... I...

CHANCE

(in pain)

... I can't move... My leg...

DAVID

(rushes back to limo)

... My Lord...

JEFFREY

This is terrible, sir -  I hope

you're not badly injured...

CHANCE

No. I'm not badly injured. But my

leg is very sore.

JEFFREY

Can you walk? It's not broken, is

it?

CHANCE

(leans against limo, holds

leg)

It's very sore.

DAVID

Perhaps I should call an ambulance.

BYSTANDER

Somebody ought to call the police!

CHANCE

(looks over, smiles)

There's no need for police, it's

just my leg.

JEFFREY

I don't think we should call anyone

just yet, it may not even be all

that serious.

CHANCE

(obviously hurting)

I agree.

JEFFREY

Let's have a look, do you mind?

CHANCE

Of course. I would like to look.

JEFFREY

It's starting to swell, is it

painful?

CHANCE

Yes.

EVE

(to Chance)

... Won't you let us do something

for you? Your leg should be

examined, we could take you to a

hospital.

CHANCE

(smiles at Eve)

There's no need for a hospital.

EVE

Why, there certainly is. You must

see a doctor, I insist on it.

Please, let us take you.

DAVID

I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I

never saw the man.

EVE

Oh, I don't think it was anyone's

fault, David.

DAVID

Thank you, ma'am.

JEFFREY

Please, sir.

CHANCE

I've never ridden in an automobile.

JEFFREY

(a beat)

I assure you, sir, David is a very

careful driver. Please, won't you

let us take you?

CHANCE

(looks at the car, then

decides)

... Yes. You can take me.

JEFFREY

Very good.

CHANCE

(as he gets in)

... My suitcase.

JEFFREY

Yes sir. I'll take care of that.

EVE

I hope you're comfortable.

CHANCE

Yes. I am.

EVE

These can be such trying situations

everyone seems to make such a to-do

over a simple little accident. Of

course, they can be very

frightening, and I must apologize

for David, he's never had an

accident before.

CHANCE

Yes. He's a very careful driver.

EVE

... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg

feeling any better?

CHANCE

It's feeling better, but it's still

very sore.

EVE

I see.

(a thought)

... Say, would you mind seeing our

family doctor?

CHANCE

(doesn't understand)

Your family doctor?

EVE

Yes. My husband has been very ill.

His doctor and nurses are staying

with us. Those hospitals can be so

impersonal - why, it might be hours

before you are treated...

CHANCE

I agree.

EVE

Fine, it will save a lot of

unnecessary fuss and it will be so

much more pleasant for you...

(leans forward)

David, we'll just go on home.

Jeffrey, would you call and let

them know?

JEFFREY

Yes ma'am.

EVE

Would you care for a drink?

CHANCE

Yes. Thank you.

CHANCE (CONT'D)

I would like to watch television.

EVE

(a bit surprised)

Oh? Certainly...

EVE (CONT'D)

Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.

CHANCE

Hello, Eve.

EVE

May I ask your name?

CHANCE

(with a slight cough)

My name is Chance.

EVE

Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

CHANCE

(still indistinct)

No. I'm a gardener.

EVE

Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey

Gardiner... You're not related to

Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?

CHANCE

No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil

and Perdita.

EVE

Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful

couple, we've been friends for

years. We visit their island quite

often.

EVE (CONT'D)

Did you lose something?

CHANCE

Yes. I lost my remote control.

EVE

Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...

EVE (CONT'D)

... I'll feel so relieved after Dr.

Allenby examines your leg. After

that, David can run you on home, or

to your office or wherever you'd

prefer...

(Chance still watches TV)

... Is there anything special you

would like to watch?

CHANCE

I like to watch. This is fine.

EVE

I can see that it must be very

important for you to stay informed

of all the latest events.

CHANCE

Yes.

EVE

I admire that in a person. As for

myself, I find there is so much to

assimilate that it can become quite

muddling at times...

WILSON

Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

EVE

Good evening, Wilson.

WILSON

I shall take the gentleman to the

third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr.

Allenby is standing by.

EVE

Thank you, Wilson. That will be

fine.

EVE

Thank you, Greta.

(to Wilson)

I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm

needed.

WILSON

Yes, ma'am.

EVE

(to Chance)

I'll see you after the doctor has a

look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

(looking around mansion)

Yes, I think he should examine my

leg.

CHANCE

(looks to Wilson)

... I've never been in one of

these.

WILSON

It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's

been ill...

CHANCE

Does it have a television?

WILSON

(laughs)

No - but Mr. Rand does have one

with an electric motor, that way he

can get around by himself.

CHANCE

I see.

CHANCE (CONT'D)

How long do we stay in here?

WILSON

How long? I don't know, see what

the doctor says ...

CONSTANCE

Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

RAND

(with weakness)

... Eve...

EVE

Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm

out... How are you feeling?

RAND

Tired... And I'm getting tired of

being so tired. Other than that,

I'm doing very well.

EVE

No headaches?

RAND

No, it's been a good day - better

than yours, from what I've been

told.

EVE

(holds his hand against

her cheek)

You heard?

RAND

I may be a shut-in, but I do not

lack for news. I'm sorry you had to

go through all that.

EVE

Oh, it wasn't all that bad,

darling. We were fortunate that Mr.

Gardiner turned out to be so

reasonable.

RAND

Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet

a reasonable man. Why don't you ask

this Gardiner to join us for

dinner?

EVE

(sits on the side of the

bed)

Do you feel well enough for that?

RAND

(smiles)

Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if

I wait until I feel better, will I

ever meet the man?

RAND (CONT'D)

Constance! I want new blood

tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.

CONSTANCE

But, Mr. Rand...

RAND

Don't argue, tell Robert I want new

blood!

(turns to Eve)

... Ask him to dinner.

ALLENBY

The injection will ease the pain

and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

I understand. I've seen it done

before.

ALLENBY

Now, you'll barely feel this. It

won't hurt at all.

CHANCE

You were wrong, it did hurt.

ALLENBY

(a chuckle)

But not for long...

ALLENBY (CONT'D)

It's good that there was no

apparent damage to the bone.

CHANCE

Yes. I think so, too.

ALLENBY

However, with injuries such as

this, I have run into minor

hemorrhaging, which really isn't

too serious at the time, but can

cause secondary problems if not

looked after.

CHANCE

I see.

ALLENBY

(a look to the TV, then to

Chance)

You can pull your trousers up, now.

CHANCE

Oh, fine.

ALLENBY

(as Chance pulls up pants)

Just to take the proper

precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd

recommend we take you downstairs

and X-ray your leg.

(no reaction from Chance,

Allenby takes a long look

at him)

... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I

would like to ask you something

straight out.

CHANCE

(doesn't understand)

... Straight out?

ALLENBY

Yes. Are you planning on making any

sort of claim against the Rand's?

CHANCE

(after a beat)

Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's

what Thomas asked me.

ALLENBY

Thomas? Who's Thomas?

CHANCE

Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

ALLENBY

An attorney?

CHANCE

(turns back to TV)

Yes.

ALLENBY

(suddenly very cold)

Then you wish to handle this matter

through your attorneys?

CHANCE

There's no need for a claim, the

garden is a healthy one.

ALLENBY

(gives Chance a look)

Oh, I see...

(warms up)

... Well, then... You're a very

funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught

me off guard, I must admit...

CHANCE

(changes channels, sits on

bed)

Thank you.

ALLENBY

Good, keep your weight off that

leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it

would be best if you could stay

here for a day or two, if that

would be would be possible. Since

Benjamin became ill we have our own

hospital downstairs. I can promise

you the finest in care, unless, of

course, you would prefer to go

elsewhere.

CHANCE

Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.

ALLENBY

Fine. Would you like me to speak to

your personal physician?

CHANCE

No.

ALLENBY

(stops by door)

I'll send Wilson up to take you for

X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to

use the telephone, and please let

me know if you have any discomfort.

CHANCE

(clicking changer)

Yes, I will.

ALLENBY

Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out

here.

EVE

I wanted some fresh air, Robert.

How is Mr. Gardiner?

ALLENBY

A rather large contusion, but I

don't feel there is any serious

damage. I'd like to keep an eye on

him, though - I suggested that he

stay here for a couple of days.

EVE

Stay here? Is that necessary?

ALLENBY

Not necessary, but preferable. I

don't think he'll be a bother, he

seems like a most refreshing sort

of man.

EVE

Yes, he is different... Not the

kind of person one usually meets in

Washington.

ALLENBY

How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a

welcome change of pace.

EVE

He's very intense, and internal,

don't you think?

ALLENBY

At times, yes. But that's not an

uncommon reaction to such an

accident. Actually, I found him to

have quite a sense of humor.

EVE

Good. It might be pleasant for a

couple of days.

(Eve puts down her tea)

... Robert... Is there any

improvement...?

ALLENBY

No, Eve... I'm sorry.

EVE

... Sometimes when I see Ben I

could swear that he's getting

stronger... Something that he might

say, the way he moves, or a look in

his eyes - makes me feel that this

is all a nightmare and that he'll

be better soon... It's just so hard

to believe what's really

happening...

CHANCE

(looks back to elevator)

... That is a very small room.

WILSON

(laughs)

Yes sir, I guess that's true

smallest room in the house.

CHANCE

(glancing around)

Yes. It seems to be.

RAND

Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,

Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

(looks around room)

... I see.

CHANCE (CONT'D)

I feel very good in here.

RAND

Sure you do. This ward is air

tight, I have a little extra oxygen

pumped in, keeps my spirits up.

CHANCE

Yes. I like that very much.

BILLINGS

(lining up Chance's leg)

This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner.

Please hold still when I ask.

CHANCE

(to Billings)

Do you know Raphael?

BILLINGS

No sir, I don't believe I do.

CHANCE

Oh. I have a message for him.

BILLINGS

Yes, sir.

CHANCE

A Black man gave me the message.

BILLINGS

Well, I still don't believe I know

the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold

still.

RAND

Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -

aplastic anemia.

RAND (CONT'D)

Failure of the bone marrow to

produce red blood cells... Not a

damn thing they can do about it.

Oh, they can make me comfortable,

prolong my life with steroid

therapy and transfusions... And

what makes my blood boil, what

little I have left, that is, Mr.

Gardiner - is that it's generally a

young person's disease... Here I

am, getting on in years and about

to die of a young person's

disease...

CHANCE

(still smiles at Rand)

Yes. You look very sick.

BILLINGS

Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.

RAND

(a laugh)

I am very sick, and, as you can see

by all this paraphernalia, I am

very wealthy. I think I would

rather be wealthy and sick than

poor and sick.

CHANCE

(looks around the room)

I understand. I've never seen

anything like this on television.

BILLINGS

Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

CONSTANCE

You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay

quiet.

RAND

... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner -

we're prisoners of tubes and

technology.

CHANCE

I agree.

RAND

(flat on his back)

... You will join us for dinner,

won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

CHANCE

(also flat on his back)

Yes. I am very hungry.

RAND

... So am I, my boy - so am I.

RAND

I know exactly what you mean. Today

the businessman is at the mercy of

kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they

want to do is regulate our natural

growth! It's happening across the

country!

ALLENBY

To everyone, I'm afraid. The

Government controls are so

restricting that the Medical

Profession, as we know it, is being

legislated out of existence.

RAND

Of course! By kid-lawyers!

EVE

Won't your injury prevent you from

attending to business, Mr.

Gardiner?

CHANCE

No. It won't do that.

EVE

... Would you like us to notify

anyone for you?

CHANCE

No. The Old Man died and Louise

left.

EVE

Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you

have any need for any of our

facilities, please do not hesitate

to ask.

RAND

Do you need a secretary?

CHANCE

No, thank you. My house has been

closed.

RAND

Oh. When you say 'Your house has

been closed', you mean to say that

your business was shut down?

CHANCE

Yes. Shut down and locked by the

attorneys.

RAND

What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The

S.E.C.! Damn them!

EVE

I hope that staying here won't be

an inconvenience for you.

CHANCE

No. I like it here.

RAND

That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I

call you Chauncey?

CHANCE

(agreeable to being called

Chauncey)

Yes. Chauncey is fine.

RAND

And I'm Ben.

ALLENBY

(smiles to Chance)

... And please call me Robert.

CHANCE

Yes, Robert. I will.

RAND

So tell me, Chauncey, what are your

plans now?

CHANCE

Does this house have a garden?

RAND

Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow,

Chauncey, you will see our gardens.

CHANCE

I see. I would like to work in your

garden.

EVE

(laughs)

Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I

sometimes enjoy puttering around

myself, such a pleasant way to

forget one's troubles.

CHANCE

I am a very good gardener.

RAND

A gardener! Well put, Chauncey

excellent! Isn't that what a

businessman is? A gardener? A

person that makes flinty soil

productive with the labor of his

own hands, who waters it with the

sweat from his own brow, and who

creates a place of value for his

family and community? Yes,

Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor

-- yes, indeed, a productive

businessman is a laborer in his own

vineyard.

CHANCE

Thank you, Ben. The garden that I

left was such a place. Everything

which grew there was with the labor

of my own hands. I planted seeds

and watered them and watched

everything grow.

RAND

(weakly)

Bravo!

CHANCE

But I don't have that any more...

(points to ceiling)

... All that's left for me now is

the room upstairs.

RAND

Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you

are young, you are healthy, for

God's sake don't give up on

yourself! You have to fight! You

can't let those bastards keep you

down! I don't want to hear any more

from you about the 'Room Upstairs'.

That's where I'm going soon.

CHANCE

It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

RAND

(laughs)

Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what

they say, anyway.

RAND

... I don't know what you've heard

about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure

you know everything there is to

know. Cigar?

CHANCE

Yes, thank you.

(takes cigar)

No Ben. I don't know everything

about you.

RAND

... No, of course you don't. Excuse

me for being so presumptuous. No

man knows everything about another

man - however, very few are honest

enough to admit it.

ALLENBY

That is so true. You're different,

Chauncey... Quite different than

most men.

CHANCE

Thank you, Robert.

RAND

(picks up pool cue, weakly

strokes the balls)

... You know, Chauncey, there are

thousands of American businessmen,

large and small, that share your

plight. I've been concerned with

the situation for some time now.

RAND (CONT'D)

So I've been thinking about

beginning a financial assistance

program, Chauncey, to help out

American businessmen that have been

harassed by inflation, excessive

taxation, unions and other

indecencies...

RAND

... I'd like to offer the decent

'Gardeners' of the business

community a helping hand. After

all, they are our strongest defense

against the pollutants who so

threaten our basic freedoms and the

well-being of our middle class.

Tell me, would you have any

thoughts on such a program?

CHANCE

No, Ben.

RAND

(a smile)

Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?

Well, I can understand that. When a

man loses everything, anger has a

tendency to block out reason for a

time. Just give it some thought,

work with the idea, I'm sure you'll

have plenty to say in a few days.

CHANCE

I could give it some thought, Ben,

but my leg is very sore.

RAND

... Oh?

(looks to Allenby)

Robert, take a look, would you?

ALLENBY

Some pain is to be expected...

(bends to Chance, looks at

leg)

... And I think what would be best

for the two of you is a good

night's rest.

(checks watch)

... It's late, I'm afraid it's time

for my patients to prepare for bed.

RAND

(puts down pool cue)

We have common foes, Chauncey - kid

lawyers and our physician!

CHANCE

I agree.

WILSON

(laughing, trying to

apologize)

... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't

contain myself... I knew you were

going to come out with another one

of your jests about the elevator...

Excuse me, sir...

CHANCE

(looks back as the door

closes)

... Hmmm... Elevator.

WILSON

(laughs again)

... Yes sir - elevator!

EVE

Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how

dreadful I feel about the accident

today, but that I'm delighted that

you are staying with us.

CHANCE

Thank you, Eve - I like this house

very much.

EVE

... And Ben is just mad about you -

you've lifted his spirits so - it's

just... Well, it's just a real

pleasure having you with us.

CHANCE

Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen

that before.

EVE

Yes... I know, Chauncey.

CHANCE

I like Ben very much... He reminds

me of the Old Man...

EVE

He does...?

CHANCE

Yes. Are you going to leave and

close the house when he dies?

EVE

... Why... No, I don't think so...

CHANCE

That's good.

EVE

... Good night, Chauncey.

CHANCE

Good night, Eve.

LEWIS

Did you want a car, sir?

CHANCE

Yes. I would like a car.

LEWIS

Yes, sir.

ALLENBY

(frowns as he sees Chance

walking)

Chauncey, there you are. What are

you doing on that leg?

CHANCE

It's fine today, Robert.

ALLENBY

Shame on you, Chauncey - you should

let me be the judge of that.

(motions to Wilson)

Please, sit in the chair.

ALLENBY (CONT'D)

(checks leg)

I swear, Chauncey, between you and

Benjamin, I've got my hands full...

(looks at calf)

... Say, that is coming along, the

swelling has gone down

considerably...

(pokes a spot)

... Any pain here?

CHANCE

Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

ALLENBY

(continues examining)

... Benjamin has been hounding me

to allow him to address the annual

meeting of his Financial Institute

today, but obviously, the strain

would be impossible... How about

here, Chauncey, any soreness?

CHANCE

Hardly any, Robert.

LEWIS

Your limousine, sir.

CHANCE

Oh, thank you.

ALLENBY

(reacting to limo)

... Were you going somewhere?

CHANCE

No, Robert.

ALLENBY

(a beat)

... Oh.

(checks leg)

... My God, I only wish that

Benjamin had your recuperative

powers... Anyway, the President

offered to sit in for Ben at the

meeting, quite a nice gesture, I

felt. He's due here soon, I

believe.

CHANCE

Yes, Robert. I know about the

President.

ALLENBY

(mildly surprised)

... Oh? You've heard?

CHANCE

Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to

meet the President.

ALLENBY

(stands)

He does, does he?

CHANCE

Yes, Ben told me to be in his room

at ten o'clock.

ALLENBY

Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.

CHANCE

How do I know when it's ten

o'clock?

ALLENBY

... It's five of, you'd best get on

in there.

CHANCE

Thank you, Robert.

CHANCE (CONT'D)

I would like to walk today.

ALLENBY

Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the

President, aren't you?

CHANCE

(gets out of chair)

Oh, really?

SMYTHE

May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?

CHANCE

(with a smile)

Yes. I would like to go to Rand

Memorial Hospital.

SMYTHE

(a pause)

... Sir?

CHANCE

Yes.

SMYTHE

... Did you wish to see someone,

sir?

CHANCE

Yes, I would like to see Ben.

SMYTHE

Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this

way, sir.

RAND

Chauncey, up and around this

morning, are you?

CHANCE

Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

RAND

Well, that's good news, my boy.

CHANCE

You're looking much better today,

Ben.

RAND

Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey...

I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,

I didn't want the President to

think I was going to die during our

talk.

CHANCE

I understand.

RAND

No one likes a dying man, my boy -

because few know what death is. All

we know is the terror of it. But

you're an exception, Chauncey -

that's what I admire in you, your

marvelous balance. You don't

stagger back and forth between fear

and hope - you're a truly peaceful

man.

CHANCE

Thank you, Ben.

(looks at Rand closely)

... The nurse did a very good job,

Ben.

WOLTZ

Good morning, Mr. Wilson.

WILSON

Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to

see you again.

WOLTZ

Thank you. How have you been?

WILSON

Fine, thank you.

(hands Woltz paper)

We have an additional guest with us

today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

WOLTZ

(reads list)

I see...

(turns to other men)

Okay, let's go to work.

RAND

Yes, when I was younger I had

thoughts about public office... But

I found, Chauncey - that I was able

to contribute more as a private

citizen... of course, my wealth

provided me with considerable

influence, but I've tried, believe

me, not to misuse that power...

It's extremely important, Chauncey,

when one is in a position of

eminence, that he does not allow

himself to become blinded to the

needs of the country... The

temptations are strong, and I've

been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many,

but I have tried to stay open to

voices of the people... I have

tried to remain honest to myself...

CHANCE

(changing channels)

I see, Ben.

RAND

... Maybe one day you shall find

yourself in a similar position,

Chauncey... Maybe one day...

MRS. AUBREY

(into phone)

Yes... Oh, very good, Lewis, thank

you.

RAND

He's here.

(into phone)

Yes, Mrs. Aubrey?

(listens)

Fine. Show the President to the

library, we'll be along in a few

minutes.

RAND (CONT'D)

It's an old habit that goes along

with power -- keep them waiting...

RAND (CONT'D)

(stands, very weak)

Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the

President on my own two feet.

TERESA

But, Mr. Rand...

RAND

(puts an arm around Chance

for support)

Shall we go, Chauncey?

CHANCE

Yes, Ben. That's a good idea.

RAND

Mrs. Aubrey, have you received the

papers on the Caracas agreement?

MRS. AUBREY

Yes, sir. They're ready for you to

sign.

RAND

Excellent.

(turns to Chance)

A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.

CHANCE

(seeing her for first

time)

I agree, Ben.

WOLTZ

Good morning, Mr. Rand.

RAND

Woltz, how have you been?

WOLTZ

(passes detector over

Rand's body)

Just fine, thank you, sir.

(turns to Chance)

And you must be Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

Yes.

WOLTZ

(passes detector over

Chance)

Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

(as he finishes)

Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT

Ben!

RAND

(very weak)

... Mr. President, how good to see

you.

PRESIDENT

It's so good to see you too, Ben,

you look terrific!

RAND

(barely able to stand)

I'm not convinced of that, Mr.

President, but your visit has

raised my spirits...

PRESIDENT

Well, I'm delighted to be here, my

friend. I've missed you.

(guides Rand to chair)

Here, sit down, get off your feet.

CHANCE

Good morning, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(smiling)

... Hello.

RAND

Mr. President, I'd like you to meet

my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey

Gardiner.

PRESIDENT

Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.

CHANCE

You look much taller on television,

Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(a beat)

... Oh, really...

RAND

(smiling)

You will find that my house guest

does not bandy words, Mr.

President.

PRESIDENT

Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just

fine with me - I'm a man that

appreciates a frank discussion...

Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...

CHANCE

(sitting)

Yes, I will.

PRESIDENT

(also sits)

Now, Ben, did you happen to get a

chance to...

CHANCE

Yes?

PRESIDENT

I just wondered if you had gone

over my speech, Ben.

RAND

Yes, I did.

PRESIDENT

... Well?

RAND

Overall - pretty good. But, Mr.

President, I think it's very

dangerous to resort to temporary

measures at this stage of the game.

PRESIDENT

Well, Ben... I...

RAND

I sympathize with your position,

Mr. President, I know how difficult

it is to be straightforward, the

reaction to such a speech could be

chaos.

PRESIDENT

That's too big a risk, I can't take

the chance.

CHANCE

(again perks up)

Yes?

ALLENBY

Oh... Hello.

RIFF

(entering)

Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret

Service.

ALLENBY

... Yes. Of course.

RAND

... There is no longer any margin

for inflation, it has gone as far

as it can, you've reached your

limits on taxation, dependence on

foreign energy has reached a

crisis, and, from where I see it,

Mr. President, the Free Enterprise

System has reached the breaking

point. We are on the brink of

another crash from which recovery

might not be possible.

PRESIDENT

It's that serious, huh?

RAND

I'm afraid so.

PRESIDENT

Do you agree with Ben, Mr.

Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do

you think we can stimulate growth

through temporary incentives?

CHANCE

(a beat)

As long as the roots are not

severed, all is well and all will

be well in the garden.

PRESIDENT

(a pause)

... In the garden?

CHANCE

That is correct. In a garden,

growth has its season. There is

spring and summer, but there is

also fall and winter. And then

spring and summer again...

PRESIDENT

(staring at Chance)

... Spring and summer...

(confused)

Yes, I see... Fall and winter.

(smiles at Chance)

Yes, indeed...

(a beat)

Could you go through that one more

time, please, Mr. Gardiner?

RAND

I think what my most insightful

friend is saying, Mr. President, is

that we welcome the inevitable

seasons of nature, yet we are upset

by the seasons of our economy.

CHANCE

Yes. That is correct.

PRESIDENT

(pleased)

...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must

admit, that is one of the most

refreshing and optimistic

statements I've heard in a very,

very long time.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

... Many of us forget that nature

and society are one! Yes, though we

have tried to cut ourselves off

from nature, we are still a part of

it! Like nature, our economic

system remains, in the long run,

stable and rational. And that is

why we must not fear to be at its

mercy!

(he smiles at Chance, who

is absorbed in looking

around the room at the

books)

... I envy your good, solid sense,

Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely

what we lack on Capitol Hill.

(glances at watch)

I must be going.

(holds out hand to Chance)

Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been

enlightening...

CHANCE

Yes. It has.

PRESIDENT

... You will honor me and my family

with a visit, won't you?

CHANCE

Yes. I will.

PRESIDENT

Wonderful, we'll all look forward

to seeing you.

(turns to Rand)

Is Eve around? I'd like to say

hello.

RAND

No, she flew up to Boston for

another charity event. She'll be

sorry to have missed you.

PRESIDENT

I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted

me to send along her best to the

two of you - and, Ben, I want to

thank you for your time and

thoughts.

RAND

Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank

you for coming to spend time with a

dying man.

PRESIDENT

Now, Ben, I won't have any of that.

Why don't you listen to your good

friend Chauncey this is a time to

think of life!

RAND

You're right, Mr. President I don't

like feeling sorry for myself.

PRESIDENT

Take care of yourself, Ben.

RAND

You take care too, Bobby.

PRESIDENT

(as he turns to go, a

smile to Chance)

Mr. Gardiner...

RAND

(as the door closes)

He's a decent fellow, the

President, isn't he?

CHANCE

Yes, Ben - he is.

RAND

He was quite impressed with your

comments, Chauncey - he hears my

sort of analysis from everyone, but

yours, unfortunately - seldom if

ever at all.

CHANCE

I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice

talking to the President.

PRESIDENT

Kaufman, I'm going to need

information on Mr. Chauncey

Gardiner's background.

KAUFMAN

(makes note of name)

Gardiner, yes, sir.

PRESIDENT

And put it through on a Code Red -

I want it as soon as possible.

KAUFMAN

No problem, Chief.

RAND

(very weak)

... You know, Chauncey, there's

something about you... You're

direct, you grasp things quickly

and you state them plainly. You

don't play games with words to

protect yourself. I feel I can

speak to you frankly... You know

what I was talking to you about

last night?

CHANCE

(blankly)

No, Ben.

RAND

Oh, sure you do, the financial

assistance program. I think you

might be just the man to take

charge of such an undertaking. I'd

like you to meet with the members

of the Board, we'll be able to

discuss the matter at greater

length at that time.

CHANCE

I understand.

RAND

(stops outside his door)

And, please, Chauncey - don't rush

your decision. I know you're not a

man to act on the spur of the

moment.

CHANCE

Thank you, Ben.

RAND

And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you

must excuse me - I'm very tired all

of a sudden.

CHANCE

(as they go in)

I'm sorry that you are so sick,

Ben.

EVE

(approaches Chance, calls)

Chauncey!

CHANCE

(stops, turns)

Hello, Eve.

EVE

Your leg must be getting better.

CHANCE

Yes. It's feeling much better now.

EVE

Good. I'm glad to hear that.

(they walk together)

... How did you like meeting the

President?

CHANCE

Fine. He's very nice.

EVE

Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get

to see him.

EVE (CONT'D)

... Chauncey... Last night you

mentioned an old man, that died.

CHANCE

Yes.

EVE

Was he a relative? Or an intimate

friend?

CHANCE

(looking at greenhouse)

He was a very wealthy man, he

looked after me since I was young.

EVE

Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?

CHANCE

(quizzically)

... Mentor...?

EVE

Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't

mean to pry. You must have been

very close to him.

CHANCE

Yes. I was.

EVE

I'm sorry...

(getting more to the

point)

... And what about Louise? YOU

mentioned that she had gone, were

you close to her also?

CHANCE

Yes. I liked Louise very much. She

was his maid.

EVE

(relieved)

Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I

thought perhaps she was someone

that you may have been romantically

involved with.

CHANCE

Oh, no. She brought me my meals.

EVE

(pleased)

Of course.

CHANCE

What is that?

EVE

Our greenhouse.

CHANCE

(pleased)

Oh, I like that very much.

EVE

Yes, so do we.

PRESIDENT'S VOICE

... And there are so many of you

that have proclaimed that we are on

the brink of the worst financial

crisis in this nation's history.

And there are so many of you

demanding that we put into effect

drastic measures to alter its

course. Well, let me tell you,

gentlemen, I have been conducting

multiple-level consultations with

members of the Cabinet, House and

Senate. I have conducted meetings

with prominent business leaders

throughout the country. And this

very morning I had an in-depth

discussion with your founder and

Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin

Turnbull Rand and his close friend

and advisor Mr. Chauncey

Gardiner...

PRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)

... Well, gentlemen, I found this

to be a most rewarding

conference... To quote Mr.

Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As

long as the roots of industry

remain firmly planted in the

national soil, the economic

prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'

ALLENBY

(motioning toward door)

Excuse us, please.

PRESIDENT'S VOICE

Gentlemen, let us not fear the

inevitable chill and storms of

autumn and winter, instead, let us

anticipate the rapid growth of

springtime, let us await the

rewards of summer. As in a garden

of the earth, let us learn to

accept and appreciate the times

when the trees are bare as well as

the times when we pick the fruit.

EVE

(hesitates)

... I'm...

(pause)

... I'm very grateful that you're

here, Chauncey...

(pause)

... With us ...

CHANCE

So am I, Eve.

ALLENBY

(sits alongside Eve)

... Eve - this has been an

exhausting day for Ben...

EVE

(anxious)

... But he's...?

ALLENBY

He's resting comfortably now.

There's no cause for alarm, yet...

MRS. AUBREY

Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone

call for you. Sidney Courtney, the

financial editor of the Washington

Post.

CHANCE

(not moving)

Thank you.

MRS. AUBREY

Would you care to take it, sir?

CHANCE

Yes.

EVE

I'll be all right, Chauncey you go

ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...

CHANCE

(rising)

Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.

EVE

... He's such a sensitive man, so

considerate...

CHANCE

(picks up phone, looks at

TVs)

Hello.

COURTNEY

Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid

Courtney, Washington Post.

CHANCE

Hello, Sid.

COURTNEY

I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.

Gardiner, I know you must be very

busy.

CHANCE

(looking from one TV to

the other)

No. I'm not busy.

COURTNEY

Then, I'll be brief. I covered the

President's speech at the Financial

Institute today, and since the Post

would like to be as exact as

possible, we would appreciate your

comments on the meeting that took

place between Mr. Rand, the

President and yourself.

CHANCE

The President is a nice person. I

enjoyed it very much.

COURTNEY

Good, sir. And so, it seems, did

the President - but we would like

to have some facts; such as, uh...

What exactly is the relationship

between yourself and that of the

First American Financial

Corporation?

CHANCE

I think you should ask Mr. Rand

that.

COURTNEY

Of course. But since he is ill I'm

taking the liberty of asking you.

CHANCE

Yes, that is correct. I think you

should ask Mr. Rand that.

COURTNEY

I see. Then one more quick

question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at

the Post would like to, uh - update

our profile on you - what exactly

is your business?

CHANCE

I have nothing more to say.

COURTNEY

(to himself)

Typical - no wonder he's so close

to Rand...

CHANCE

Hmmm. Elevator.

JENNIFER

(surprised to see him)

Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you

looking for someone?

CHANCE

No.

MRS. AUBREY

I can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere.

JENNIFER

He's in the basement.

MRS. AUBREY

What's he doing in the basement?

JENNIFER

I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey.

MRS. AUBREY

Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking

all over.

CHANCE

Oh, yes.

MRS. AUBREY

Morton Hull, the producer of 'This

Evening' just called.

CHANCE

Yes, I have seen that show on

television.

MRS. AUBREY

Of course. They would like you to

appear on the show tonight. The

Vice President was scheduled, but

he had to cancel, and they asked if

you would be interested.

CHANCE

Yes. I would like to be on that

show.

MRS. AUBREY

Fine. They felt that since you had

such close ties with the President,

you would be a splendid choice.

(Chance nods, there is a

pause)

... Can I help you? Are you looking

for something?

CHANCE

No. I like this attic very much.

PRESIDENT

... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on

national television today he is

obviously a financial sophisticate

of some reknown.

KAUFMAN

Yes, sir - we are aware of all

that, but still, we haven't been

able to...

PRESIDENT

(interrupts)

He's an advisor and close personal

friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes,

they have volumes of data on

Benjamin!

KAUFMAN

Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to

contact Mr. Rand, but he was too

ill to...

PRESIDENT

(again interrupts)

I do not want Benjamin Rand

disturbed! You have other ways of

gathering information than to

trouble a dying man. Use whatever

agencies are necessary to put

together a detailed history of

Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into

problems, alert Honeycutt.

(he stands)

I'll be in the office at seven in

the morning and I would like to

have it at that time.

(he starts for door)

I've got to take a leak.

KAUFMAN

Right, Chief.

PERKINS

I believe these garments will be

quite appropriate, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

(eyes on TV)

Yes. They are fine.

PERKINS

Excuse me, sir.

EVE

(entering)

Chauncey...

CHANCE

(rises)

Hello, Eve.

EVE

Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you

well. I know you'll be smashing.

CHANCE

Thank you, Eve.

EVE

And Benjamin sends along his best

wishes.

CHANCE

How is Ben feeling?

EVE

He's tired, Chauncey - but he's

going to watch you tonight. We'll

both be watching.

CHANCE

That's good. I like to watch, too.

EVE

I know you do - you and your

television...

(a pause)

... Good luck, Chauncey.

COURTNEY

... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of

fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's

a strong candidate for one of the

vacant seats on the board of First

American. But before we can do any

sort of a piece on the man, we're

going to need facts on his

background...

(turns to Kinney)

... Kinney, what did you come up

with?

KINNEY

(after a pause)

... Nothing.

COURTNEY

(sighs, taps pencil on

table)

... Skip the levity, Kinney - what

have you got?

KINNEY

(another pause)

... I realize this sounds banal but

there is no information of any sort

on Gardiner. We have no material on

him - zilch...

HULL

Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the

producer of 'This Evening.'

CHANCE

(as they shake hands)

Hello, Morton.

HULL

Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact

that you occupy such a position in

the world of finance makes you

ideally suited to provide our

millions of viewers with an

explanation of this nation's

economic crisis.

CHANCE

I see.

HULL

Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that

more people will be watching you

tonight than all those who have

seen theater plays in the last

forty years?

CHANCE

Yes. It's a very good show.

HULL

I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.

COLSON

(gives Chance water)

Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

Thank you. I'm very thirsty.

COLSON

Yes, sir - it's hot under those

lights.

HULL

Now, if the host wants to ask you a

question, he'll raise his left

forefinger to his left eyebrow.

(Chance watches TV)

Then you'll stop, and he'll say

something, and then you'll answer.

COLSON

(a last-minute dab)

Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.

DUPONT

Ladies and gentlemen, our very

distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey

Gardiner!

DUPONT (CONT'D)

Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have

you with us this evening.

CHANCE

Yes.

DUPONT

(showing Chance to chair)

I'd like to thank you for filling

in on such short notice for the

Vice President.

CHANCE

(sits)

You're welcome.

DUPONT

(also sitting)

I always find it surprising, Mr.

Gardiner, to find men like

yourself, who are working so

intimately with the President, yet

manage to remain relatively

unknown.

CHANCE

Yes. That is surprising.

DUPONT

(a beat)

... Well, your anonymity will be a

thing of the past from now on.

CHANCE

(doesn't understand)

I hope so.

DUPONT

Yes... Of course, you know, Mr.

Gardiner, that I always prefer an

open and frank conversation with my

guests, I hope you don't object to

that.

CHANCE

No. I don't object.

DUPONT

Fine, then let's get started. The

current state of our country is of

vital interest to us all, and I

would like to know if you agree

with the President's view of the

economy?

CHANCE

Which view?

DUPONT

Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his

speech at the Financial Institute

the President consulted with you

and Benjamin Rand, did he not?

CHANCE

Yes. I was there with Ben.

DUPONT

I know that, Mr. Gardiner.

CHANCE

Yes.

DUPONT

(a beat)

Well, let me rephrase the question;

the President compared the economy

of this country to a garden, and

stated that after a period of

decline a time of growth would

naturally follow. Do you go along

with this belief?

CHANCE

Yes, I know the garden very well. I

have worked in it all my life. It

is a good garden and a healthy one;

its trees are healthy and so are

its shrubs and flowers, as long as

they are trimmed and watered in the

right seasons. The garden needs a

lot of care. I do agree with the

President; everything in it will

grow strong, and there is plenty of

room in it for new trees and new

flowers of all kinds.

DUPONT

(over TV)

...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was

very well put indeed, and I feel it

was a booster for all of us who do

not like to wallow in complaints or

take delight in gloomy predictions.

PRESIDENT

Gloomy predictions? That insolent

son of a bitch!

DUPONT

(over TV)

Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner,

it's your view that the collapse of

the Stock Market, the dramatic

increase in unemployment, you feel

that this is just another season,

so to speak, in the garden?

CHANCE

In a garden, things grow - but

first some things must wither; some

trees lose their leaves before they

grow new leaves...

CHANCE

(over TV)

... Then they grow thicker and

stronger and taller. Some trees

die, but fresh saplings replace

them. Gardens need a lot of care

and a lot of love.

CHANCE

(over TV)

... And if you give your garden a

lot of love, and if you work very

hard and have a lot of patience, in

the proper season you will see it

grow to be very beautiful...

FRANKLIN

(puzzled)

It's that gardener!

JOHANNA

Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.

FRANKLIN

No! He's a real gardener!

JOHANNA

(laughs)

He does talk like one, but I think

he's brilliant.

DUPONT

(over TV)

I think your metaphors are quite

interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but,

haven't we seen seasons that have

been devastating to certain

countries?

DUPONT

(over TV)

Such as disasterous winters,

prolonged droughts that have wiped

out crops, hurricanes that have all

but swept away island communities?

Doesn't a country need to have

someone in charge that can see it

through such crises?

PRESIDENT

... That bastard...

DUPONT

(over TV)

Don't we need a leader capable of

guiding us through the seasons? The

bad as well as the good?

CHANCE

(over TV)

Yes. We need a very good gardener.

DUPONT

Do you feel that we have a 'Very

good gardener' in office at this

time, Mr. Gardiner?

CHANCE

(a beat)

I understand.

DUPONT

I realize that might be a difficult

question for you, Mr. Gardiner -

but there are a lot of us around

the country that would like to hear

your thoughts on the matter.

CHANCE

Oh, yes. It is possible for one

side of the garden to be flooded,

and the other side to be dry...

CHANCE

(over TV)

... Some plants do well in the sun,

and others grow better in the cool

of the shade.

CHANCE

(over TV)

... It is the gardener's

responsibility to take water from

the flooded area and run it to the

area that is dry. It is the

gardener's responsibility not to

plant a sun-loving flower in the

shade of a high wall...

LOUISE

Gobbledegook! All the time he

talked gobbledegook! An' it's for

sure a White man's world in

America, hell, I raised that boy

since he was the size of a pissant

an' I'll say right now he never

learned to read an' write - no sir!

Had no brains at all, was stuffed

with rice puddin' between the ears!

Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb

as a jackass an' look at him now!

Yes, sir - all you gotta be is

white in America an' you get

whatever you want! Just listen to

that boy - gobbledegook!

CHANCE

... It is the responsibility of the

gardener to adjust to the bad

seasons as well as enjoy the good

ones. If the gardener does his job,

everything will be fine.

RAND

(smiling)

Splendid. Just splendid...

RAND (CONT'D)

Damn, Constance, get in here! You

shouldn't miss any of this!

RAND (CONT'D)

I'm becoming quite attached to

Chauncey - quite attached...

(Eve smiles)

... And so are you, aren't you,

Eve.

EVE

(a beat)

... Yes, I am, Ben.

RAND

(reaches out, takes her

hand)

That's good... That's good.

DUPONT

(over TV)

Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound

of our audience, I'd say that your

words are a most welcome respite

from what we've been hearing from

others...

CHANCE

(over TV)

Thank you.

DUPONT

I'm sorry to say that our time is

running short, but before we close,

I'd like to ask one final question.

What sort of gardener, sir, would

you be?

CHANCE

(with confidence)

I am a very serious gardener.

PRESIDENT

Oh, Jesus...

FRANKLIN

Okay, I'll see you in twenty

minutes.

JOHANNA

(coldly)

... Business, bullshit! Going out

in the middle of the night to meet

that bitch in a bar...

FRANKLIN

Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's

a damn fine attorney! I've got to

talk to her about this Gardiner...

JOHANNA

(turns over in bed)

Good night.

FRANKLIN

Look, Johanna...

JOHANNA

(cuts him off)

I said good night!

COLSON

Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr.

Gardiner! What spirit you have,

what confidence! Exactly what this

country needs!

FIRST LADY

... Darling... What's wrong?

PRESIDENT,

... I can't... I just can't right

now... I'm sorry, dearest... I just

can't...

FRANKLIN

... It didn't make any sense to me

at all. I didn't know what the hell

he was talking about...

SALLY

He wasn't making a speech to us,

Tom - he was talking to the masses.

He was very clever, keeping it at a

third grade level - that's what

they understand...

FRANKLIN

Yeah? Well, I don't understand what

was up his sleeve when he pulled

that stunt with us? What was he

doing? And why?

SALLY

Who knows...? Maybe the government

had something to do with it.

FRANKLIN

You know, Sally - I really feel

like I've been had, and you know

what that means, don't you?... It

means that any political future I

had is right down the toilet!

FRANKLIN (CONT'D)

... Jesus, the thought of spending

the rest of my life as an attorney,

that is really a downer... And,

Christ, Sally, I almost forgot

Johanna is starting to think

something's going on between...

KINNEY

... Sid, be reasonable - I've been

everywhere, there's no place left

to check!

COURTNEY

Try again.

KINNEY

Sure, try again - where? There's

nothing, it's like he never

existed!

COURTNEY

Try again.

KINNEY

Sid, it's useless!

COURTNEY

I said - try again.

KINNEY

Up yours, Sid. You try again, I

quit!

WILSON

An outstanding speech, sir.

PERKINS

May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

CHANCE

Yes. Thank you, Perkins.

RAND

(with some effort)

... You possess a great gift,

Chauncey, of being natural. And

that, my boy, is a rare talent, the

true mark of a leader. You were

strong and brave, yet did not

moralize. I hope the entire country

was watching you tonight, the

entire country...

ALLENBY

And you, Benjamin, must be strong

and brave for me. Turn over,

please.

RAND

(holds up hand)

In a minute, Robert - in a

minute... Chauncey, I would like to

ask a favor of you...

CHANCE

Certainly, Ben.

RAND

Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is

hosting an evening reception

tomorrow evening honoring

Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet

Union... I think it's rather

obvious that Robert won't allow me

to attend, so - would you go in my

place, and escort Eve?

CHANCE

Yes. I would like to escort Eve.

RAND

Good. Together, the two of you

should create quite a stir - I can

already hear the gossip.

EVE

(with a blush)

... Ben, really...

RAND

(reaches out a tired hand

to Chance - Chance holds

it)

... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank

you very much.

(takes back hand)

... All right, Robert, I'm all

yours.

EVE

(stopping by bedroom door)

... You don't happen to have a

tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?

CHANCE

No, thank you.

EVE

Oh. Well, we can fix up one of

Ben's for you tomorrow night.

Sophie insists an Black Tie.

CHANCE

I see.

EVE

(a pause, softly)

... I have very few friends,

Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends

are all quite a bit older...

EVE (CONT'D)

... Good night, Chauncey.

CHANCE

Good night, Eve.

PRESIDENT

Good morning, gentlemen.

AIDES

(as one)

Good morning, sir.

PRESIDENT

(to Kaufman)

This is not what I requested.

KAUFMAN

No, sir.

PRESIDENT

This information goes back three

days. I want the standard file, you

know that.

KAUFMAN

Right, Chief.

PRESIDENT

So...? Where the hell is it?

KAUFMAN

We... uh, have been unable to come

up with any information before the

man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ...

and, uh...

PRESIDENT

What the hell are you talking

about, Kaufman?

KAUFMAN

Well, we do have data from

Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it

isn't pertinent.

PRESIDENT

I'd like to hear that data,

Kaufman.

KAUFMAN

Yes, sir.

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

(reading)

Suits hand-made by a tailor in

Chicago in 1918. The tailor went

out of business in 1929, then took

his own life.

... His shoes were hand-made in

1928. The cobbler has long since

been dead. Underwear, all of the

finest cloth, factory destroyed by

fire in 1938. The man carries no

identification; no wallet, no

driver's license, no credit cards.

... He carries one item along with

him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch

crafted at the turn of the century;

so far they have been unable to

ascertain where or when purchase

was made.

... He has never dyed his hair.

... Computers have analyzed

Gardiner's vocal characteristics;

it is impossible to determine his

ethnic background, they feel his

accent may be northeastern, but

they will not commit to that.

... Fingerprint check proved

negative, no identification

possible.

(a pause)

... That's it, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(into intercom)

Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs

poached this morning, please.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

... So what does all that add up

to?

KAUFMAN

Well, sir - it occurred to us that

he might be an agent of a foreign

power. But, we ruled that out, as

they invariably are provided with

too much documentation, too much

American identity... We, uh...don't

quite know what to make of it yet,

sir... But we'll keep on top of it,

Mr. President - we'll come up with

the answer.

PRESIDENT

(with sarcasm)

I would appreciate that.

CHANCE

(without turning from TV)

Come in!

EVE

Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?

CHANCE

No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

EVE

(moving to bed)

Well, it seems you've been

described as one of the architects

of the President's speech. And your

own comments from the 'This

Evening' show are quoted side by

side with the President's.

CHANCE

I like the President. He is a very

nice man.

EVE

(sits on bed)

I know...

(a moment)

... So are you, Chauncey ...

(another moment, Chance

watches TV)

... Do you mind my being here, like

this?

CHANCE

(a bite of toast)

No, Eve. I like you to be here.

EVE

... You know, Chauncey... I want us

to be...

(with difficulty)

I want us... You and I to become...

close... I want us to become very

close, you know...?

CHANCE

Yes, Eve. I know that.

EVE

... I'm grateful to you,

Chauncey... I would have opened to

you with a touch, and you know

that...

(Chance,confused, turns to

her)

... But you're so strong - I can

trust myself with you. I'm glad,

Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed

so much restraint...

CHANCE

Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you

didn't open.

EVE

I know you are, Chauncey...

(a pause)

... You conquer a woman from within

herself, you infuse in her the need

and desire and the longing for your

love.

CHANCE

(another bite of toast)

Yes. That could be true.

EVE

(sits up)

... I guess I may as well be honest

about my feelings, Chauncey, as I

know you are I am in love with

you... I love you and I want you...

And I know that you know it and I'm

grateful that you've decided to

wait until... Until...

EVE (CONT'D)

(stopping by door)

... I do love you, Chauncey.

EVE (CONT'D)

Oh, come in, Maggie.

MAGGIE

(entering)

Yes, ma'am.

EVE

Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's

tuxedo for you now.

CHANCE

Fine.

ALLENBY

(into phone)

Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.

(a wait)

Is Thomas Franklin in?

(a beat)

Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby,

would you please tell Mr. Franklin

that I would like to talk to him?

It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

REPORTER #1

Mr. Gardiner, what did you

think of the Post's editorial on

the President's speech?

CHANCE

(smiling for photogs)

I didn't read it.

REPORTER #2

(surprised)

But air - you must have at least

glanced at it.

CHANCE

No. I did not glance at it.

REPORTER #3

Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times

spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of

optimism,' what was your reaction

to that?

CHANCE

(continues to pose for

pictures)

I did not read that either.

REPORTER #3

Well, how do you feel about that

phrase, 'Peculiar brand of

optimism?'

CHANCE

I do not know what it means.

REPORTER #2

Sorry to persist, air, but it would

be of great interest to me to know

what newspapers you do read.

CHANCE

I do not read any newspapers. I

watch TV.

TV REPORTER

... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that

you find television's coverage of

the news superior to that of the

newspapers?

CHANCE

(flatly)

I like to watch TV.

TV REPORTER

(pleased) )

Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what

is probably the most honest

admission to come from a public

figure in years. Few men in public

life have the courage not to read

newspapers none have the guts to

admit it.

CHANCE

You're welcome.

EVE

I've never seen anyone handle the

media as well as you, Chauncey.

You're so cool and detached -

almost as if you were born to it.

CHANCE

Thank you, Eve.

WATSON

Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.

EVE

Mr. Watson.

WATSON

(looks to Chance)

And you must be Mr. Gardiner,

correct?

CHANCE

Yes.

EVE

Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson

of the State Department.

CHANCE

(they shake)

Hello, Dennis.

WATSON

A pleasure to meet you, sir.

CHANCE

Yes. It is.

SOPHIE

Eve, child! How nice of you to

come.

EVE

Hello, Sophie.

SOPHIE

And look who you brought with!

EVE

Sophie, this is Chauncey

Gardiner...

SOPHIE

(hugs Chance)

Oh, I've been just dying to meet

you, Mr. Gardiner!

EVE

Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia

Rowley.

CHANCE

(being hugged)

Hello, Sophia.

SOPHIE

(steps back, admires

Chance)

Sophie, please - call me Sophie!

SOPHIE (CONT'D)

(as they go, to Chance)

You just have to let me introduce

you to some of the exciting people

here... Why, Pat Boone and his

daughter may drop by later!

PRESIDENT

(gluing the wing)

... How are the kids getting along?

FIRST LADY

Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy

this morning. She loves California,

but to quote her, she says, 'The

Secret Service is getting to be a

drag.' I guess she wants her

privacy...

PRESIDENT

Huh... I'm glad they're along with

her, if you know what I mean... How

about Jack?

FIRST LADY

Well, I think Jack needs some time

alone with you, darling... He's

getting to that age, you know... He

really misses you...

PRESIDENT

Yeah... I'll have a talk with him

as soon as...

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(calls out)

... Yes, come in!

KAUFMAN

Sorry to disturb you, chief but we

have new developments.

PRESIDENT

Oh? What?

KAUFMAN

We have word that the Soviets have

put out a top priority alert for

information on Gardiner's

background. So far, they haven't

come up with a thing - what's more,

as a result of their eagerness, one

of their ablest agents blew his

cover, we have him in custody at

this time.

PRESIDENT

Good. Anything else?

KAUFMAN

Yes, chief - eight other foreign

powers have put Gardiner under

surveillance. We're around-the

clock now, sir - I'll keep you

posted.

SKRAPINOV

Mrs. Rand. How delightful.

EVE

It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador.

(a nod to his wife)

Mrs. Skrapinov.

SOPHIE

Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you

to our guest of honor, His

Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov,

Ambassador of the Soviet Union.

CHANCE

(stumbles over name)

Hello... His... His...

SOPHIE

Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr.

Chauncey Gardiner.

SKRAPINOV

Delighted. Delighted.

SOPHIE

And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

SKRAPINOV

You must sit with us, my friend, we

have much to discuss.

CHANCE

I agree.

SKRAPINOV

(to Eve)

How is my dear friend Benjamin

feeling?

EVE

He's doing as well as could be

expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still

speaks of the stimulating

discussions he's had with you.

SKRAPINOV

Ah, Yes. Please give him my

regards.

EVE

Of course.

SOPHIE

(tugs at Eve)

Come on, Eve. Let's let the men

talk, there are so many people that

have been asking about you.

EVE

(to Chance and Skrapinov)

Would you two excuse me for a

moment?

SKRAPINOV

Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall

yield the pleasure of your company

to others.

CHANCE

Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.

EVE

(smiling)

I'll be back soon...

SKRAPINOV

(as they walk)

I'm sorry we haven't met sooner,

Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of

seeing you on television last night

and I listened with great interest

to your down-to-earth philosophy.

I'm not surprised that it was so

quickly endorsed by the President.

(quietly)

... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how

serious is Benjamin's illness? I

did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by

discussing it in detail.

CHANCE

Ben is very ill.

SKRAPINOV

Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As

you know, we in the Soviet Union

have the keenest interest in

developments of the First American

Financial Corporation... We are

pleased to hear that you may fill

Benjamin's place should he fail to

recover.

(arrive at table)

Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.

SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)

(moves chair close to

Chance)

... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be

quite candid - considering the

gravity of your economic situation,

shouldn't we, the diplomats, and

you, the businessman - get together

more often?

CHANCE

Yes, I agree, I think so too.

SKRAPINOV

To exchange our thoughts - what

does a Russian know about business?

On the other hand, what does an

American know about diplomacy?

CHANCE

Yes, I understand.

SKRAPINOV

And I have noticed in you a certain

reticence regarding political

issues - so why not a coming

together? An interchange of

opinion? We may find, my friend,

that we are not so far from each

other, not so far!

CHANCE

(an engaging smile)

We are not far...

(motions at nearness of

their chairs)

... our chairs almost touch.

SKRAPINOV

(laughs)

Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed

almost touching! And we want to

remain seated on them, correct? We

don't want them snatched from under

us, am I right? Because if one

goes, the other goes, and then -

boom! Boom! And we are both down

before our time, you see? And

neither of us wants that, do you

agree?

CHANCE

I certainly do.

SKRAPINOV

Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you

by any chance enjoy Krylov's

fables? I ask this because there is

something... there is something

Krylovian about you.

CHANCE

Do you think so? Do you think so?

SKRAPINOV

So you know Krylov!

SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)

(amazed)

So you know your Krylov in Russian,

do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must

confess I had suspected as much all

along - I know an educated man when

I meet one!

CHANCE

Oh, good.

SKRAPINOV

Yes, it is very good!

CHANCE

Yes, it is.

(beat)

Would you tell me your name again,

please?

SKRAPINOV

(slaps Chance on the back)

Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor!

Vladimar Skrapinov!

CHANCE

Yes. I like that name very much.

SKRAPINOV

And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!

(in Russian)

How poetic! Chauncey, a name of

uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a

bit of the French, a suggestion of

a stroll through the flowers! A

beautiful name, my friend!

SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)

(immediately rises)

Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!

EVE

Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if

I might.

(to Chance)

Everyone wants to meet you.

CHANCE

Yes, Eve. That would be good.

SKRAPINOV

(shakes Chance's hand)

We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner,

many times!

CHANCE

Thank you.

SKRAPINOV

Yes? What have you found?

KARPATOV

(in Russian)

We have nothing on him, Ambassador

Skrapinov.

SKRAPINOV

(holds up hand, looks

around)

Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for

one, understands our language.

KARPATOV

(in English, softly)

Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.

SKRAPINOV

What do you mean there is nothing?

That's impossible.

KARPATOV

There is no information available

on the man before he moved into

Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to

be such a difficult task that it

has resulted in the loss of one of

our agents to the United States

Government.

SKRAPINOV

But... Where was this man Gardiner

before last week?

KARPATOV

Apparently the White House shares

our curiosity - they have also

launched an investigation, and,

according to our sources, neither

the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met

with success.

SKRAPINOV

I see. Clearly, such interest on

their part is of great political

significance.

KARPATOV

Clearly, yes comrade.

SKRAPINOV

Hmmm... Take this down.

(Karpatov takes out

notepad)

I want this quote included in the

Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner,

in an intimate discussion with

Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that

"Unless the leaders of the opposing

political systems move the chairs

on which they sit closer to each

other, all of their seats will be

pulled from under them by rapid

social and political changes."'

KARPATOV

Very good, Your Excellency.

COURTNEY

... It's strictly rumor at this

stage, Lyman - just something in

the wind...

STUART

Something rather big in the wind,

I'd say. So whose files were

destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?

COURTNEY

I don't know. Like I said, it's

just rumor so far, but we should

start nosing around, see if we can

talk to some people...

STUART

... But why? The question is why?

Why would they destroy Gardiner's

files? What is it about his past

they are trying to cover up?

(his voice fades)

... A criminal record? A membership

in a subversive organization?

Homosexual, perhaps?

FRANKLIN

... And he told us that he had been

living there since he was a child,

working as a gardener. He showed us

a room in the garage, where he said

he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't

really believe him, of course - but

why the act?

ALLENBY

I have no idea...

FRANKLIN

Another thing that baffles me,

Doctor - what was his connection

with the deceased? Major financial

dealings, obviously - but our firm

has no record of any such

transactions.

ALLENBY

Hmmm. You say he showed you his

garden?

FRANKLIN

Well, he said it was his, he walked

us through it.

ALLENBY

I see.

(leans close to Franklin)

Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and

Miss Hayes to keep this incident

with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.

There's no telling what he was

involved in, and the matter may be

extremely confidential. So please,

not a word.

FRANKLIN

Of course, Doctor, I understand.

ALLENBY

Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

FRANKLIN

Certainly, glad to be of help.

STIEGLER

Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler,

of Harvard Books.

CHANCE

(a two-handed handshake)

Hello, Ronald.

STIEGLER

Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have

been wondering if you'd consider

writing a book for us? Something on

your political philosophy. What do

you say?

CHANCE

I can't write.

STIEGLER

(smiles)

Of course, who can nowadays? I have

trouble writing a post card to my

children! Look, we could give you a

six figure advance, provide you

with the very best ghostwriter,

research assistants, proof

readers...

CHANCE

I can't read.

STIEGLER

Of course not! No one has the time

to read! One glances at things,

watches television...

CHANCE

Yes. I like to watch.

STIEGLER

Sure you do! No one reads!...

Listen, book publishing isn't

exactly a bed of roses these

days...

CHANCE

(mild interest)

What sort of bed is it?

RAND

(speaks slowly, with

effort)

Everything. I said everything and

that's exactly what I mean.

MONROE

But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so

extensive, I would like to be more

precise in...

RAND

(interrupts)

What could be more precise than

everything...?

MONROE

(turns to Townsend)

Everything to Mrs. Rand.

TOWNSEND

(drafting a will)

Right - everything.

RAND

You two don't have to lecture me on

the complexities of the situation,

no one knows that better than

myself... But you must understand

that I have an endless faith in

Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that

she will select the right person

for guidance when she has the

need... She has shared my life,

gentlemen, she has given me far

more pleasure than any of my so

called assets... Life has suddenly

become very simple for me now - I

may be older than my years, and you

might think me to be somewhat

feeble... But I am still in love,

gentlemen, thank God for that...

DENNIS

We could do it now, we can go

upstairs.

(no reaction from Chance)

... Please, it's time for us. Come

upstairs.

CHANCE

(blankly)

I like to watch.

DENNIS

Watch? You mean just watch me?

Doing it alone?

CHANCE

Yes. I like to watch very much.

DENNIS

Well, if that's what you want, then

I want it too.

(takes Chance's arm)

We can go this way.

CHANCE

I want to tell Eve.

DENNIS

Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

CHANCE

Yes.

DENNIS

(pulling Chance)

Oh, you can tell her later. She'll

never miss you in this crowd.

FIRST LADY

(after some time)

... Maybe you should talk to

somebody, darling.

PRESIDENT

No, that won't do any good.

FIRST LADY

(another pause)

... Is it me? Is there something

I've done?

PRESIDENT

Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not

you...

FIRST LADY

(another pause)

It's your damn job. It never

happened when you were a senator...

PRESIDENT

It's not that, I just...

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?

KAUFMAN'S VOICE

(over phone)

Chief, we have a break in the case.

Our man at the Washington Post says

they are working on a story that

either the CIA or the FBI destroyed

Gardiner's files before anyone

could get to them.

PRESIDENT

What? Why?

KAUFMAN'S VOICE

(over phone)

I can't say at this time - neither

agency will admit to a thing.

PRESIDENT

(getting out of bed)

Okay, get both Directors over here,

I'll be right down.

DENNIS' VOICE

(softly)

Can you see well?

CHANCE

(squints at small screen)

Yes, very well, thank you.

DENNIS' VOICE

Do you like it?

CHANCE

Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.

DENNIS' VOICE

(disappointed at it being

'tiny')

... Are you sure you like it?

CHANCE

Yes, I do, it's very good.

DENNIS' VOICE

(excited)

Really? Really!!!

CHANCE

Do you need a doctor? I could call

Robert...

DENNIS' VOICE

I don't want Robert.

CHANCE

I see.

DENNIS' VOICE

(through the groans)

Your foot! Give me your foot!!

CHANCE

(some pain)

Thank you. But my leg is still a

little sore.

CHANCE (CONT'D)

Are you sure you're not ill?

NOVOGROD

The rank-and-file in the FBI feel

he is FBI, but others feel he is a

CIA man who knows how to destroy

FBI files.

SKRAPINOV

That could be possible...

NOVOGROD

But we are quite certain, comrade,

that this man Gardiner is a leading

member of an American elitist

faction planning a coup d'etat.

SKRAPINOV

A coup d'etat! Of course, that was

foreseen by Lenin himself!

NOVOGROD

That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov.

We have ascertained that Gardiner

heads a big-business power group

that will soon be taking over the

American government.

SKRAPINOV

Big business. I could work with

that faction quite nicely, Colonel

Novogrod.

NOVOGROD

You have proven that already,

Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be

congratulated for recognizing the

importance of this man and

establishing an early friendship.

SKRAPINOV

Thank you, Colonel.

NOVOGROD

(raising his glass)

Let us toast to the success of the

coup.

GROUP TOAST

Na zdorov'e!

EVE

Chauncey, where have you been? I

was afraid you got bored and left,

or that you were with some

mysterious woman.

CHANCE

No. I was with a man. We went

upstairs.

EVE

Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always

involved in some sort of

discussion...

CHANCE

He was very ill, I stayed with him

for a while.

EVE

It must be the punch, and it is

stuffy in here -- I feel it a

little myself. You're an angel, my

dear - thank God there are still

men like you around to give aid and

comfort.

HONEYCUTT

I never gave such a directive, Mr.

President.

BALDWIN

Nor I, sir - it would be out of the

question.

PRESIDENT

Gentlemen, I didn't call you here

at such an hour to make

accusations, I just want to explore

the possibilities. Now, I have

three questions; Is the man a

foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly

found that our methods of gathering

data are grossly inefficient? Or,

thirdly, have the man's files been

destroyed? Now, I'd like some

answers.

BALDWIN

Gardiner is not a foreign agent,

there are now sixteen countries

investigating the man. We can rule

that out.

PRESIDENT

Very well... Can we rule out

inefficiency...?

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

I see. What about question three?

Is it possible to erase all traces

of a man?

HONEYCUTT

Highly unlikely, sir... In fact,

the boys around the Bureau feel

that the only person capable of

pulling it off would be an ex

F.B.I. man.

BALDWIN

(a look to Honeycutt)

I don't think that's entirely true,

Grover.

PRESIDENT

(to Baldwin)

And what do the boys around

Intelligence think?

BALDWIN

Well, Mr. President... They don't

quite know what to think.

PRESIDENT

(rising)

Gentlemen, needless to say, there

is going to be a full Congressional

investigation of your respective

operations.

(goes to door)

Good night.

EVE

(holding his hand)

I feel so close to you, so safe

with you, Chauncey...

(stops at her bedroom

door)

... And Benjamin understands that,

dearest... He understands and

accepts my feelings for you...

CHANCE

Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.

EVE

(opens her door)

... Come in, Chauncey - please come

in...

CHANCE

Thank you.

EVE

I can sense that you've been

through a lot, Chauncey. But one

day, when you feel like it, you'll

tell me all about your life...

(Chance watches an old

movie)

... But, even if you tell me

nothing, even if it's too painful

for you to reveal your past...

EVE

(breathless)

Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so

much!

EVE (CONT'D)

... You don't want me, Chauncey...

You don't feel anything for me...

Nothing at all...

EVE (CONT'D)

I just don't excite you at all... I

don't know what you want... I don't

know what you like...

CHANCE

I like to watch.

EVE

(not understanding)

To watch...? To watch me...?

CHANCE

Yes. I like to watch.

EVE

(uncertain)

... Is that all you want...?

(a hesitation)

... To watch me...?

CHANCE

Yes. It's very good, Eve.

EVE

... But I've never done...

(another hesitation)

... You mean...? When... When...

When I do it? ... When I touch

myself...?

EVE (CONT'D)

(getting aroused)

Oh, Chauncey...

EVE (CONT'D)

One of those little things you

don't know about me yet, darling -

I'm a little shy.

CHANCE

(going to door)

Good night, Eve.

RAND

No more, Robert... No more

needles...

ALLENBY

(sits on the side of the

bed)

It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you

can feel it.

RAND

I know, Robert... But, strangely

enough, I don't feel too bad about

now... I feel all right... I guess

it's easier... knowing Chauncey is

here... to take care of things...

RAND (CONT'D)

No, I don't want any of that...

Please... please, just get me Mr.

Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll

head it up...

EVE

... And I feel so free now,

Chauncey. Until I met you, I never

felt acknowledged by a man...

(Chance gazes out at the

falling snow)

... I always had the feeling that I

was just a vessel for a man,

someone that he could take hold of,

pierce, and pollute. I was merely

an aspect of somebody's lovemaking.

Do you know what I mean?

EVE (CONT'D)

(presses close to him)

Dearest, you uncoil my wants;

desire flows within me, and when

you watch me my passion dissolves

it. You set me free. I reveal

myself to myself and I am drenched

and purged.

CHANCE

That's very interesting, Eve.

TERESA

Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like

to see you.

CHANCE

Yes. I would like to see Ben.

RAND

(slowly)

... Chauncey... Chauncey...

CHANCE

Yes, Ben - are you going to die

now?

RAND

(a weak smile)

... I'm about to surrender the Horn

of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel,

my boy...

CHANCE

Oh, I see.

RAND

(reaches out to him)

Let me feel the strength in your

hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your

strength...

(holds Chance's hand)

Yes, that's good... I hope,

Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay

with Eve... Take care of her, watch

over her, she's a delicate flower,

Chauncey...

CHANCE

(smiling)

A flower...

RAND

She cares for you and she needs

your help, Chauncey... there's much

to be looked after...

CHANCE

Yes. I would like to do that.

RAND

... I've worked very hard and

enjoyed my life... I've known

success... and I've felt love... My

associates, Chauncey - I've talked

with them about you... They're

eager to meet you... very eager to

meet you... I'm very fond of you,

Chauncey... And I understand Eve...

Tell her that... tell her I'm madly

in love with her...

ALLENBY

... He's gone, Chauncey.

CHANCE

Yes, Robert. I have seen it before.

It happens to old people.

ALLENBY

(covers Rand's face)

Yes, I suppose that's true.

CHANCE

(turns to Allenby)

Will you be leaving now, Robert?

ALLENBY

In a day or two, yes.

CHANCE

Eve is going to stay. The house

will not be closed.

ALLENBY

(a moment, a look)

... You've become quite a close

friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...

(a beat)

... Chance...?

CHANCE

Yes. I love Eve very much.

ALLENBY

I see...

(another beat)

... And you are really a gardener,

aren't you?

CHANCE

(brightens)

Yes, Robert - I am.

(a smile at Allenby)

I'll go tell Eve about Ben now,

Robert.

PRESIDENT

... Millions of people across the

world have heard of the passing of

Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately,

only relatively few will feel the

pain and sadness at such a loss. To

most, Benjamin Rand was a legend;

to those of us gathered here today,

Benjamin was a beloved friend. My

personal association with Benjamin

dates back many years, and my

memories of our friendship will

stay with me forever.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

I initially came in contact with

the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a

young lieutenant in the Air Corps,

a navigator flying missions over

Europe. That plane that I learned

to know so well was manufactured by

the Rand Aeronautics Corporation.

(a beat)

Benjamin Rand was an industrial

giant, known to be powerful and

uncompromising, and yet, on a

personal level, we have all felt

his warmth and humor...

(a beat)

... I would like to share with you

a few quotes, and a few feelings

from our dear friend.

(holds up paper, reads)

... 'I do not regret having

political differences with men that

I respect; I do regret, however,

that our philosophies kept us

apart.'

... 'I have no use for those on

welfare, no patience whatsoever...

But, if I am to be honest with

myself, I must admit that they have

no use for me, either.'

... 'I was born into a position of

extreme wealth, I have spent many

sleepless nights thinking about

extreme poverty -  I do not know

the feelings of being poor, and

that is not to know the feelings of

the majority of people in this

world. For a man in my position,

that is inexcusable.'

'Life is a state of mind.'

... 'When I was a boy, I was told

that the Lord fashioned us from his

own image. That's when I decided to

manufacture mirrors.'

DUDLEY

But what do we know of the man?

Nothing! We have no inkling of his

past!

NELSON

Correct, and that is an asset. A

man's past can cripple him, his

background turns into a swamp and

invites scrutiny.

CALDWELL

To this time, he hasn't said

anything that could be used against

him.

BENNET

Well, I'm certainly open to the

thought - it would be sheer lunacy

to support the President for

another term.

NELSON

No one will go along with that...

Look at the facts, gentlemen, the

response from his appearance on

'This Evening' was overwhelming; he

has excited and awakened the people

of this country at a time of

despair.

MURRAY

He's personable, elusive, yet

seemingly honest. He's riding a

crest of popularity that builds

with every statement. As far as his

thinking goes, he appears to be one

of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen,

that he is our only chance - Mr.

Chauncey Gardiner!

EVE

It was very moving, Bobby - thank

you so much...

PRESIDENT

We're all going to miss him, Eve...

(glances around)

... Where's Mr. Gardiner?

ALLENBY

... He walked off...

EVE

Chauncey is so sensitive... He was

overcome with grief...

PRESIDENT

I can certainly understand that...

FIRST LADY

Of course... I'm so sorry for you,

Eve...

EVE

Thank you, Nancy.

FIRST LADY

I'll call you soon.

EVE

... Do you think we should look for

him?

ALLENBY

I don't think so, he should be

along soon...

EVE

I wish he were here...

EVE

We have to find him, Robert - he

could be lost, something may have

happened, we can't leave him!

ALLENBY

You really care for him, don't you,

Eve?

EVE

I do - we do - both of us, Ben and

I feel so much for Chauncey...

ALLENBY

I think we'd better go look for

him.

(he taps on the glass

partition)

David!

JEFFREY

Look!

EVE

There he is! Chauncey!

EVE

Chauncey! Chauncey!

CHANCE

(stops, looks up)

Hello, Eve.

EVE

Oh, Chauncey...!

EVE (CONT'D)

Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have

you been? We thought we'd lost you -

we've been looking all over!

CHANCE

Yes. I've been looking for you,

too, Eve.

FADE OUT.

THE END
