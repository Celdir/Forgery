SHOOTING DRAFT (1984)

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

Make one more move and you'll both

be staying late for the rest of the

week.

THE BOYS

(softly; in unison)

Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

I didn't hear you.

THE BOYS

(louder)

Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

(used to this)

Step away from the curb, children.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

You're late again, Rick.

RICK

I know, Sister, but I have a very

good excuse.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

There can be no excuse for tardiness.

RICK

You're absolutely right. I should

never have stopped to save that

drowning infant. I'm just weak,

Sister; I'm so weak.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

All right, stop that... Children, on

the bus.

RICK

Sister, do you ever get lonely after

vespers? If you do, why don't you

give me a call. I'm in the book.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS

(smiling despite

herself)

Get going, Rick... you're late enough

as it is.

RICK

Right... Think it over.

RICK

(over mike)

If you don't all calm down I'm gonna

drive this thing over a cliff.

RICK

(continuing;

philosophically)

Ah... youth.

O'NEILL (O.S.)

Okay, Timmy... hold that smile...

and watch the birdie.

O'NEILL (O.S.)

There.

O'NEILL

These should be in the mail to you

by next Friday.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

Next.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

Whoa. Look at those babies.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

How are we doing? My name is O'Neill.

And you are...?

WOMAN

Klupner.

(teasing)

Mrs. Klupner.

O'NEILL

Mrs.?

WOMAN

I'm separated.

O'NEILL

Then there is a God. Why don't we

take that baby picture.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

If I were you, I'd breast feed until

I was 17 or 18.

(gets behind camera;

sizing up the shot)

Tell ya what...

O'NEILL (O.S.)

Why don't you lean into the picture

with your child?

O'NEILL (O.S.)

(continuing)

A-huh. A little more... good!

O'NEILL

I'm getting one heck of a glare off

your dress there. Could you undo a

few buttons?

WOMAN

(seductively)

Of course.

O'NEILL (O.S.)

Now lean in a little more... more...

more...

O'NEILL (O.S.)

(continuing)

Hold that pose.

O'NEILL

Where'd she go?

RICK

She probably had sex scheduled for

12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the

guys for a drink... I have major

news to announce.

O'NEILL

Okay... be right with ya.

RICK (O.S.)

Pictures a family will cherish

forever.

RICK

Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?

CHULO

Hey, you guys, what's going on?

RICK

We're going for a little liquid

refreshment.

CHULO

Great. I'll go with you. Wait a

second. Hey, Raul! Move that car,

will you?

CHULO

(continuing)

Roberto, you finished fixing that

lighter yet?

CHULO

(continuing; to Rick)

I'm glad you guys came by... What's

the occasion?

O'NEILL

Rick's got an important announcement

to make.

CHULO

Yeah. What is it?

RICK

I've decided not to run for President.

CHULO

Too bad, man, that blows my chance

to be Ambassador to France.

CHULO

Manuel, be sure and finish up the

electrical system on that Chevy.

GARY

(yelling; into phone)

Screw you... Screw that... Don't

jerk me around. You promised me 1500

seats for the Police Concert... 1500,

not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw

you -- Screw Sting.

(hangs up and sees

the guys standing

there)

Hi, guys.

RICK

Gary, you're quite an animal.

GARY

Screw you...

GARY

(continuing; into

phone)

Hello, Concert tickets... What? Pat

Benitar has a yeast infection? She's

cancelling? Screw her. You know what

this is gonna cost me?...

(he hangs up)

Okay. Let's go.

GARY

(annoyed)

Screw you... That's crap... Suck

my...

(softly)

Oh, Mom, I didn't know it was you...

eggs and milk... Okay, I won't forget.

GARY

Let's go.

RICK

Isn't he incredible, gets along with

everybody.

CHULO

Yeah, he's really got his thing

together.

GARY

Oh, eat me!

CUSTOMER ONE

Waiter.

CUSTOMER ONE

We'd like to order now.

RYKO

How you guys doin'... Could you

believe how overcast it was this

morning? Bad day for sailin', waves

are too rough and...

CUSTOMER

(annoyed)

You can skip the small craft warnings.

We're in a hurry.

RYKO

No prob, bud... Here's today's

dealie...

RYKO

We got... uh, veal... ah... veal...

(to customer)

What's this word?

CUSTOMER ONE

Parmisan.

RYKO

Yeah right. I always want to say

Paramisian when I see that. We looked

at them under the jigamabob in biology

once. Little squirmy, creepy things

that live in your intestine and...

CUSTOMER

Please... We have an appointment in

a half hour...

RYKO

Wow, sounds stressful. What do you

guys do for a living?

CUSTOMER ONE

We're lawyers.

RYKO

Whoa... You got to go to school for

that or what?

CUSTOMER

(he's had enough)

Look, forget the specials. We'll

take three hamburgers.

RYKO

Okay, great... Any of you guys got a

pencil by any chance?

RYKO

(impressed)

All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece

of paper?

RICK

Ryko. Come on!

RYKO

Be right there.

(to customers)

Nice rappin' with you guys.

Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone

else will have to help you.

(calling off)

Skip!

SKIP

Like um... What's the deal, you guys

gonna order?

RYKO

Hi pals.

GARY

Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's

the big announcement?

RICK

All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna

sugar-coat this thing. I've known

you guys since grade school, so I'm

gonna give it to you straight from

the hip... right from the shoulder...

without beating around the bush...

Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard

facts... tell it like it is.

CHULO

Man, you're losing your audience.

RICK

Okay... This is it... I'm getting

married.

O'NEILL

What?

CHULO

You're kidding.

GARY

I don't believe it.

RYKO

Fuck me!

RICK

Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next,

I lose my amateur standing and turn

pro.

CHULO

Hey, man, congratulations!

GARY

Wait a minute. You been living with

Debbie! Why do you want to get

married?

RICK

Because I love her. What can I tell

you?

RYKO

You sure? This means no more partying.

RICK

No more raping and pillaging, either.

You'll have to carry on without me.

GARY

Next Saturday... That's just two

more weeks to live.

O'NEILL

Hold it... As long as you're gonna

go through with this, the least we

can do is make sure you go out in

style.

CHULO

(warming to this)

Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor

party with drugs, booze and broads.

O'NEILL

Yeah. Right. All the things that

make life worth living.

RICK

Sounds swell... I'm really touched.

And my getting married's not gonna

change a thing between me and my

pals. We're still gonna go bowling

on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays

and wear women's clothes on Sunday

night. I love you guys... I always

will.

GARY

Let's have a toast.

O'NEILL

To Rick.

GARY

To us.

CHULO

To girls with big pairs.

ALL THE GUYS

Yeah, right on, etc.

CUT TO:

CUSTOMER

I'd like to pay for these.

PHOEBE

Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till

this song is over.

CUSTOMER

Excuse me, where can I try on these

pants?

DEBBIE

Right over here.

BOBBIE

(excited)

Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so

excited.

DEBBIE

Bobbie, what are you talking about?

BOBBIE

O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo

great... I don't believe it.

PHOEBE

What's happening?

BOBBIE

Debbie's marrying Rick.

PHOEBE

...Really?

DEBBIE

Yes, it's true.

PHOEBE

Ohmygod.

DEBBIE

(to Customer; realizing)

Would you get out of here.

BOBBIE

Does Cole know about this?

PHOEBE

Really -- you went with him for two

years.

DEBBIE

He still thinks I'm going with him.

I'm going to break the news to him

tomorrow.

BOBBIE

He's not gonna be happy. And your

parents can't be too thrilled either.

DEBBIE

No. As far as they're concerned the

only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I

don't care... it's my decision.

PHOEBE

(oblivious)

I'm totally blown away. You're getting

married. It seems like only yesterday

I showed you how to have oral sex.

BOBBIE

Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

DEBBIE

Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love

that.

PHOEBE

We'll invite all the girls.

BOBBIE

I don't believe it... Mrs. Rick Stahl.

DEBBIE

(between kisses)

God, you're a slob.

RICK

But a fabulous cook.

DEBBIE

What are we having?

RICK

It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or

charred flesh. I won't know till

it's finished.

DEBBIE

(looking at the stove)

I think your dinner's burning.

RICK

Don't worry... it's supposed to do

this.

DEBBIE

(setting the table)

Want to hear something great? Bobbie

and Phoebe are throwing me a shower.

It's really gonna be fun.

RICK

Not as much fun as the bachelor party

the guys are throwing for me.

DEBBIE

You're going to have a bachelor party?

RICK

Of course. I'm a traditional guy...

It's a traditional event.

(he brings all the

food to the table)

Well, what do you think?

DEBBIE

It looks awful.

RICK

Yes, but looks are deceiving...

(takes a bite)

Not in this case, however.

DEBBIE

Are you going to have women at your

party?

RICK

No, sweetheart, it's a stag party.

Does stay home.

DEBBIE

I'm not talking about does. I'm

talking about hookers.

RICK

Oh, those. Why do you ask?

DEBBIE

Because from what I've heard, it's a

tradition and you're a traditional

guy.

RICK

Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo

man. No painted lady ever gonna come

between us.

DEB

I need you to promise.

RICK

Okay, you got it. I got a way we can

seal the deal -- what'd you say?

DEBBIE

(calling O.S.)

Cole?... Cole!

DEBBIE

Cole?

COLE (O.S.)

Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

COLE

Hi, Deb. Just got back from the

mountains.

(as he cuts in with a

surgeon's skill)

Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna

look great in the den.

DEBBIE

Cole, we've got to talk.

COLE

Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?

DEBBIE

No, Cole, I...

COLE

(lifting an organ of

some sort O.S.)

It's all right, I forgive you. I'm

not the vengeful type. We'll forget

what happened. Why don't we take a

trip together? Maybe kill a few lions

in Kenya over Christmas.

DEBBIE

Cole, listen to me... I've got to

tell you...

COLE

You know, when you dumped me for

that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll

be back. God wants the two of you to

be together, and sure enough...

DEBBIE

Cole, I'm marrying Rick.

COLE

(confused)

You're marrying him? Then why are

you coming back to me?

DEBBIE

I'm not. I just thought I should

tell you myself before you heard it

somewhere else.

COLE

You know how that makes me feel,

Deb? Wanta know how that makes me

feel?

(softly)

Angry, Deb.

(a little louder)

Yesss, that's the word, angry. But

if he makes you happy, you go right

ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.

(a little nuts)

No matter what, no matter how angry

it makes me, no matter how much it

hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very,

very happy.

DEBBIE

Cole, I'm sorry, I...

COLE

That's all right, Deb. Go be happy

and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.

DEBBIE

(uncomfortable)

I'm going now, Cole.

COLE

I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.

STAN

Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.

RICK

You wouldn't hurt your own brother,

would you?

(looking at the needle

cautiously)

I changed my mind. I don't need a

blood test. The marriage is off. I --

RICK

(continuing)

You always were sneaky, Stan, very

sneaky.

STAN

Rick, marriage will be good for you.

It's done wonders for me.

RICK

True, you're a lot handsomer now.

Don't you have enough blood already?

STAN

(without much

conviction)

You won't miss a thing about being

single... The wild parties, the

different girls every night, running

around like a maniac... God, I miss

that.

RICK

Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I

didn't know you were going to fill

'er up. Just take a couple of gallons,

okay?

RICK

(continuing)

That's an even trade... a cotton

ball for all my blood.

STAN

(returning to this

world)

Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't

wait for that bachelor party... I

need the action.

STAN

(continuing)

Don't say anything to my wife about

it.

RICK

Hi, Tina.

TINA

(looking up)

Rick...

(to PATIENT)

Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in-

law. He's getting married.

PATIENT

(without turning around)

Congratulations.

TINA

Nurse, will you take over?

TINA

(continuing)

I'm so happy for you.

RICK

Oops!

MR. THOMERSON

(frustrated)

All right, who serves?

DEBBIE

You do, Daddy.

MR. THOMERSON

Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You

don't have to kill it.

RICK

Can't I just maim it a little?

MRS. THOMERSON

Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.

MR. THOMERSON

No. Let's at least finish the set.

MAN

One of these days I'm gonna burn

Thomerson's court to the ground.

RICK

Well, I have to admit my game's a

little rusty, but I love polo. It's

unrelenting, a constant challenge to

the senses. Really a beautiful

experience.

MR. THOMERSON

Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

RICK

I'd love that.

MR. THOMERSON

(sitting on his anger)

Good. I think you're an asshole. No,

let me correct that, an immature

asshole. Which is fine, except you're

marrying my daughter and I'm afraid

my grandchildren are going to be

little assholes.

RICK

Mr. Thomerson, I...

MR. THOMERSON

Let me finish. Debbie's an adult.

She can do what she wants. But if

you want your marriage to last, you're

going to have to change some things

about yourself. If I may make some

suggestions...

RICK

Feel free.

MR. THOMERSON

First, you're a slob. You have to

dress for success. Second, your

outlook on life...

MRS. THOMERSON

I'm using the same caterer for the

shower I had for our Christmas party

last year.

DEBBIE

Great, Mom.

ILENE

If I were you, I'd worry less about

the shower and more about Rick's

bachelor party.

DEBBIE

Ilene, why would I want to do that?

I trust Rick.

ILENE

Of course you do. I trusted my ex,

Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk

from experience. What do you think

they do at these parties, have tea

and play scrabble?

DEBBIE

Ilene, Rick promised...

ILENE

Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.

MRS. THOMERSON

(trying to change the

subject)

Girls, why don't we go inside for

lunch.

(calling to Mr. T)

Boys, would you mind bringing in

that lemonade?

MR. THOMERSON

In a second...

(to Rick)

And you're irresponsible. Show some

initiative, try to better yourself,

stop showing off, actions speak louder

than words.

RICK

Well, sir, that's quite a list. But

you're absolutely right. And if I

work hard at it, I think I can be a

totally changed person by the time

we finish lunch...

NEIGHBOR

I hate those people... I really do.

COLE

Hi, everybody. Am I late?

MR. THOMERSON

Not at all. We're just finishing

lunch.

COLE

Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson.

Hello, Debbie.

COLE

(continuing)

And...

RICK

Bond... James Bond.

MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)

So, Cole, you been practicing your

game?

COLE (O.S.)

Sure have...

DEBBIE

Why is Cole here?

MRS. THOMERSON

You know your father enjoys his

company.

RICK

Much the way Hitler enjoyed hanging

out with Mussolini.

MR. THOMERSON

Nice shot.

COLE

Thank you, sir.

MR. THOMERSON

I know you're as unhappy as I am

about Debbie's marriage to Rick.

COLE

Yes, sir, I am.

MR. THOMERSON

Cole, I don't want you to give up on

her.

COLE

I've tried to change her mind.

MR. THOMERSON

It's not her mind you need to change.

It's Disneyland head in there.

COLE

But how can I do that?

MR. THOMERSON

If it were me, I'd reason with him

first. Then, if that failed...

(with malice)

...I'd take more persuasive action.

COLE

(conspiratorily)

Thanks for the advise, sir.

MR. THOMERSON

Keep me informed.

MR. THOMERSON

The thought of that person marrying

my daughter makes me want to upchuck.

MRS. THOMERSON

You can tell a man by his friends.

FATHER FALWELL

They're not such a bad bunch.

MR. THOMERSON

No?

(he points off)

That's his best man peeing on a tree.

FATHER FALWELL

If everyone would take their

positions...

FATHER FALWELL

(continuing)

Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...

FATHER FALWELL

Flower Girls... Now Rick...

(he gestures for him

to start down the

aisle)

Good... Debbie and Mr. Thomerson.

RICK

Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck

to see the groom before the wedding?

COLE

I want Debbie.

RICK

Cole...

COLE

You dump her and I'll give you cash.

RICK

What's Debbie's blue book value right

now?

COLE

Five thousand dollars.

RICK

No.

COLE

Seventy-five hundred.

RICK

Not interested.

COLE

Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster

oven, a Litton microwave, a

Cuisinart...

RICK

I'm marrying Debbie.

COLE

Michelin tires... brand new. A set

of Sears Best metric tools...

RICK

(to O'Neill)

What is this person's story here?

O'NEILL

The way I see it, the big lug is in

love and he's got a lot of major

appliances lying around.

DEBBIE

Cole, what are you doing here?

MR. THOMERSON

He's just trying to save you from

making a mistake.

(to Rick)

A big mistake.

RICK

Thanks, Dad.

(to Cole)

Cole, go away.

COLE

He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll

never be true to you the way I would.

RICK

Thank you. We'll all keep that in

mind. 'Bye now.

COLE

(pissed)

Rick, me and you aren't through yet.

RICK

(a la talk show host)

Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier.

Let's hear it for him -- a funny,

funny guy. We love ya, babe.

RICK

(to O'Neill)

You think the gods are telling me

something?

RICK

(drowsy)

Huh? Wha...

DEBBIE

I can't sleep.

RICK

Oh... I got something for that.

DEBBIE

Stop fooling around... I need to

talk.

RICK

What's the matter?

DEBBIE

I don't know... I just feel scared.

RICK

(he sits up)

About what?

DEBBIE

The wedding, my parents, your family,

our friends, my job, the future, our

relationship, the caterers, my gown,

your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the

apartment, my shower, your bachelor

party...

RICK

I think the only think you've left

out are our relations with the Soviet

Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna

be all right.

DEBBIE

Before or After I have my nervous

breakfown?

RICK

C'mere.

DEBBIE

That feels so great.

RICK

Good...

DEBBIE

Um... that's very relaxing.

RICK

Now, I want you to lie down and drift

off to slumberland.

RICK

(continuing)

Close your eyes... that's it...

There's nothing to worry about... I

love you... I'm a great guy...

(yawning)

In two days you're gonna be Mrs.

Great Guy.

RYKO

You sure Gary's got this whole party

deal together?

CHULO

Yeah, man, he's got us a great room

at the hotel and lots of chicks.

RYKO

I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a

lot of dinero.

CHULO

What time are we supposed to get to

the hotel?

O'NEILL

Don't worry, Chulo, the party's not

gonna start without you. We got plenty

of time.

STAN

I can't wait to see old Larry...

It's been five years.

RICK

At least.

O'NEILL

Where the hell is he?

RICK

Knowing Larry, he probably missed

the flight.

STAN

There he is... Hey, Larry!

LARRY

(talking very slowly)

Guys... guys... guys...

RICK

'Ludes... 'ludes... 'ludes.

LARRY

God, I love you guys.

LARRY

(continuing)

This makes me so happy.

O'NEILL

So, Larry, how have you been?

LARRY

Just in love with everybody. It's

really a beautiful planet. I love

you, Rick. I love you guys. I love

everybody.

RICK

So how's your wife?

LARRY

I hate her. I hate her guts, the

bitch.

O'NEILL

Larry, you and your wife got problems?

LARRY

I don't want to talk about it. I

love you guys. I love my friends.

LARRY

(continuing)

You want to share it?

RICK

Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

LARRY

Right.

LARRY

My marriage is the worst. All crap.

A big pile of shit.

RICK

Maybe your marriage should lay off

grains for a while.

LARRY

She hates me. It's over. You'll see,

as soon as you get married, everything

changes. You sure you want to go

through with it, man?

RICK

(his interest peaked)

What do you mean, it changes?

DEBBIE

(hugging Larry)

Larry, how are you?

LARRY

Hi, Debbie, congratulations. Hey, do

you know where there's a pharmacy

around here so I can get a

prescription filled?

RICK

Come on, get him on the bus.

CUT TO:

RICK

Well... twenty-four more hours to go

and tonight we'll share with our

friends and loved ones the joys of

those last moments of singleness.

DEBBIE

You better not have too much joy.

RICK

Wouldn't think of it. Because

tomorrow...

(starts singing)

We're going to the chapel and we're...

DEBBIE

(singing)

Gonna get married...

EVERYBODY

Going to the chapel and we're gonna

get married.

DEBBIE

Gee, I really love you...

RICK

And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried.

EVERYBODY

(whooping it up)

Going to the chapel of love.

RICK

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

EVERYBODY (V.O.)

Going to the chapel of love.

RICK

This is it, lady. Last stop.

DEBBIE

Can't I just go with you guys?

RICK

Sorry, we got men's business to do.

It's no place for a lady.

DEBBIE

Remember, you promised... no screwing

around.

RICK

Did I promise that? I don't remember

that...

DEBBIE

You're really pissing me off.

RICK

Okay, I promise... I swear on my

mother's grave.

DEBBIE

Your mother's not dead.

RICK

Well, if I go back on my word, I'll

kill her.

DEBBIE

Have a good time. Don't make it too

late.

RICK

Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun

shower. Use soap.

DEBBIE

I love you.

O'NEILL

(to Rick)

What's the matter?

RICK

(snapping out of it)

Nothing... Let's get crazy!

RYKO

All right!

CHULO

When do the girls get to the party?

O'NEILL

Don't worry, Gary's taking care of

that now.

DISSOLVE TO:

GARY

So we want your best girls, the cream

of your crop.

JUMBO

Let's see your bread.

JUMBO

(continuing)

Okay, I got just what you're looking

for.

(calling off)

Margot... Darlene...

GARY

They'll do just fine. Hiya, girls.

Look, after the orgy, maybe we could

have coffee.

JUMBO

Shorty, where's the party?

GARY

Park View Hotel, Room 1002.

JUMBO

They'll be up there in a half hour.

GARY

Okay. Nice to meet you both.

COLE

Hi. I must have just missed my friend.

He hired you for a bachelor party.

JUMBO

At the Park View Hotel, Room 1002.

What about it.

COLE

Yeah. Right.

(takes out piece of

paper)

This is the new address. We changed

our minds and decided to send the

girls over to his house instead.

COLE

(continuing)

And here's a fifty... I want this to

be a surprise, so you never saw me,

okay?

JUMBO

(pocketing the money)

No problem.

COLE

(to himself)

Now she'll see what kind of jackoff

he is.

RICK

Be careful with it. It's a rental.

O'NEILL

(to some dignified

guests)

We who are about to go ape shit salute

you.

RYKO

All right, I'm stoked!

MANAGER

Just where do you guys think you

are?

O'NEILL

The Library of Congress?

CHULO

Detroit?

LARRY

Beyond the sun?

RICK

Are any of those right?

MANAGER

This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the

Hotel Manager. Are you looking for

someone?

RICK

Yes, you. We're looking for our

room... 1002.

MANAGER

It's on the tenth floor.

RICK

What do you know, they moved it.

Catch you later.

MANAGER

Keep your voices down. This is a

respectable establishment. We don't

go for any funny business here. Just

then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat

and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass

him and enter the elevator with the

boys.

RICK

I see what you mean... You're a

beautiful guy. And you're doing a

damn good job.

PHOEBE

Do you have any more of this dip,

Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent.

MRS. THOMERSON

You just ate Purina Cat Chow.

PHOEBE

Gross me out...

DEBBIE

(concerned)

What do you think's gonna go on at

the guys' party?

BOBBIE

They'll probably get drunk, and watch

dirty movies. But don't worry about

the dirty movies.

DEBBIE

What do you mean?

BOBBIE

I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I

found a bunch of pornos in the back

seat of O'Neill's car.

DEBBIE

You're kidding.

BOBBIE

Nah. Everything's cool... I took

care of 'em.

(starts to giggle)

O'NEILL

1004, 1003...

(spots the room)

Aha! 1002.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

And now...

O'NEILL

(continuing)

...to our honored guest Rick, and

his life-long friends, I say...

(turns the doorknob)

...gentlemen, start your boners.

RYKO

Bitchin' place.

O'NEILL

I did the balloons myself.

CHULO

(crazed)

Where's the women, man? We gotta

have women.

O'NEILL

Chulo, one thing at a time.

CHULO

Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.

STAN

What's first?

O'NEILL

A bit of a warm-up.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos

Without Pants"...

RICK

Olivier's in that, right?

O'NEILL

Then it's on to the real thing.

GUYS

(cheering)

All right!

CHULO (O.S.)

They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy

for Danes.

RYKO

(to Chulo)

Denmark makes great Nautilus

equipment.

CHULO

I'd like to jerk and press those

babies.

RICK

(to O'Neill)

And I thought we wouldn't have any

meaningful conversation.

GUYS (O.S.)

(excitedly)

All right, yeah, yeah, yeah...

EVERYONE

(disappointed)

Awwww...

GUYS

Yes, go, go, yes, go...

GUYS

(disappointed)

Awwwwww...

RICK

Excuse me, but this is as arousing

as a stroll through the Vatican.

O'NEILL

This isn't right.

GUYS

Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh

yes...

STAN

Where are the dirty parts? I'm a

doctor. I can see these things.

CHULO

What a waste of two women.

O'NEILL

I don't get it, but at least Gary's

got the real stuff coming up here in

a few minutes.

CHULO

(in ecstasy)

Women!

MRS. THOMERSON

Yes?

MARGOT

(through heavy gum

chewing)

Yeah, hi. Look, is this...

MARGOT (O.S.)

838 North Franek Avenue?

MRS. THOMERSON

Yes.

MARGOT

We're here.

MRS. THOMERSON

How nice.

TINA

I'm Tina Stahl.

MRS. THOMERSON

Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone

come in.

DEBBIE

Tina!

DEBBIE

(continuing)

You know everyone here, don't you?

TINA

Yes.

MARGOT

One of these, huh?

DARLENE

Looks that way.

MARGOT

Buck's a buck.

DEBBIE

It's so heavy.

DARLENE

(business-like)

Is there an empty outlet in here?

CHULO

If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat

the shit out of that chick.

LARRY

(totally ripped,

staring at the black

and white image)

Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful.

RYKO

(opening a beer,

reading the label)

Isn't there any beer that's not

imported? All this stuff's from St.

Louis.

RICK

(calling to imaginary

person O.S.)

Bartender, round of brains for my

friend here.

GARY

How's it going, guys?

EVERYONE

Where's the girls? Where's the girls?

RICK

Give the guy air. Everyone to a

neutral corner.

GARY

What's going on?

CHULO

Nothing. We got no women.

GARY

Screw you.

RICK

It's true.

GARY

This place should have been wall to

wall tits by now.

RICK

(to O'Neill)

Guy paints a beautiful picture.

GARY

I'm going to see what the hell

happened.

RICK

Looks like the only one who got

screwed here was you.

GARY

Screw that.

O'NEILL

So, what do you guys think of the

party so far?

RICK

(putting his arm around

O'Neill)

Well, I think you've done a damn

fine job.

COLE

Rick, I want to talk to you.

RICK

Ah, Cole.

(turns to the others)

I don't remember ordering an asshole

from room service.

COLE

I don't want any trouble.

RICK

Oh, come on, just a little.

COLE

I'm ready to make you another deal.

RICK

(mock excitement)

Ooh, be still, my heart.

COLE

(points out window)

See that down there? That's my most

prized possession. My new Porsche.

RICK (O.S.)

Very nice...

RICK

(his voice tells us

he has something in

mind)

Isn't that a great car, Chulo?

CHULO

Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me.

I'll be right back.

COLE

Great car.

RICK

The best.

COLE

I love that car.

RICK

I'm very happy for you two.

COLE

I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie.

An even swap.

RICK

(surprised)

The car for Debbie?

COLE

(getting a little

excitable)

I mean it. The car is yours. Dump

Debbie.

RICK

Gee, guys, what should I do? The car

or Debbie?

RICK

(continuing)

What a decision here.

COLE

Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

RICK

So does Debbie.

COLE

I got the car only two months ago --

it's got --

COLE

(continuing)

Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's

gone!

RICK

Maybe it had something to do.

COLE

Shit!

O'NEILL

Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds

and I already miss him.

GARY

Jumbo, where the hell are the women?

JUMBO

What are you talking about, asshole?

GARY

Your whores never showed up.

JUMBO

They left an hour ago, pink nuts.

GARY

Screw you!

JUMBO

(irritated; a lot)

That's it, prick lips.

GARY

What are you...

JUMBO

I've had it, numb nuts... How much

money you got?

GARY

Why?

JUMBO

Because I'm pissed off. Now give me

your cash.

GARY

This is bad public relations. I was

planning to do a lot of business

with you. But now I'm going to have

to go elsewhere.

JUMBO

(mock sincerity)

Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll

give you girls.

JUMBO

(continuing; to girls)

Give him the works.

GARY

That's more like it.

DEBBIE

Are you sure this is a good idea?

ILENE

Look, you heard what those hookers

said. They were supposed to go to a

bachelor party.

DEBBIE

That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.

ILENE

Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can

have women, we can have men.

BOBBIE

(agreeing)

Yeah.

MRS. THOMERSON

(reluctantly)

I don't know about this.

DEBBIE

C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun.

PHOEBE

Look at that guy. What a hunk.

BOBBIE

Check out the other guy's buns.

TINA

Let's sit over here.

DEBBIE

C'mon, Mom.

MICHAEL

(softly; into phone)

Yes... is there a Rick Stahl

registered there?

RICK

Hookers beat you up?

GARY

Yes.

RICK

I didn't know you were into that.

CHULO

How could you be so stupid. I'm gonna

kill you.

GARY

Go ahead, but if you want women, we

need more money.

RYKO

This just isn't righteous.

GARY

(angered)

Screw you... Do me a favor, join

this decade, will ya, pal!

RICK

(as if he's working a

fundraiser)

Hey, now, our buddy needs help. Come

on, dig into those pockets. Help

this man.

(puts his arm around

Gary)

Help this person help others get

laid. Give till it hurts. He needs

you.

RICK

And there's our first pledge coming

in --

RICK

(continuing)

Hello. End Horniness Telethon. Yeah.

Michael... how you doing?

MICHAEL

I'm working... Right. At

Chippendale's. Guess what. Debbie

and her friends just walked in.

RICK

(surprised)

Really? That's very interesting.

(he brightens)

I'll tell you what... stay there and

we'll be right down. I want to check

this out.

GARY

I'll be back with women.

STAN

I might as well have left my genitals

at home, the good they're doing me

here.

CHULO

(calling after Gary)

Hurry back.

RICK

(it's obvious he has

something in mind)

While we're waiting for Gar, why

don't we all go for a little fresh

air.

RYKO

Where we going?

RICK

Out.

LARRY

(zonked and depressed)

Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.

RICK

C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.

LARRY

I just want to be alone.

RICK

All right. Now, there's milk and

cookies in the refrigerator. Go to

bed right after "Falcon Crest."

EXECUTIVE

Ed, we're so glad you could come

over at the last minute and judge

our little beauty pageant.

MR. THOMERSON

My pleasure, Al... Always happy to

help out in a pinch...

(looking around)

Excuse me. I better call my service...

tell them where I am.

MR. THOMERSON

(to executive, covering

mouthpiece)

I had to get out of the house anyway

tonight. The wife is throwing a bridal

shower for my daughter.

(into phone)

This is Ed Thomerson. Please transfer

my calls to...

(reading number off

phone)

220-1892. Right.

EXECUTIVE

Congratulations on your daughter's

wedding. Who's she marrying?

MR. THOMERSON

A real turd.

EXECUTIVE

(at a loss for words)

Well... hope she'll be very happy.

RICK

So will your friend Nick do it?

MICHAEL

He'll do anything for money.

RICK

I love his attitude.

(calling off)

They still out there?

STAN

Breathing heavy at ringside.

RICK

(a la Long John Silver)

So, they want action, eh? Are you

with me, me hardies?

MICHAEL

Guys, this is Chippendale's star

attraction, Nicholas Carter... better

known as Nick the Dick.

RYKO

Nick the what?

NICK

(proudly)

The Dick.

ALL OUR GUYS

(astonished at this

O.S. sight)

Jesus Christ!

RICK

Let's get this thing going. Tray,

please.

RICK

(continuing)

Looks good. Can I have the bun,

Michael?

RICK

(continuing)

And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick?

NICK

Nick.

RICK

Nick, if you would be so kind...

RICK

Nick, the rest is all yours.

NICK

(excusing himself)

Gentlemen.

NICK

If you ladies would like to serve

yourselves...

MRS. THOMERSON

Is this the foot long?

NICK

And then some.

ILENE

She looks up just in time to see the

guys close the kitchen door.

GARY

Ladies... come here.

HOOKER

Talk to the pimp.

GARY

Let's talk.

RAJAH

(oh-so-heavy Indian

accent)

What can I be doing for you?

GARY

You're a pimp?

RAJAH

I'm telling you I am, Joe.

GARY

I want women.

RAJAH

That I got. Very good women. They

sit on your face, anything you want.

GARY

I'll take some.

RAJAH

Big problem now. Soon they go to

customers.

GARY

I need them for a bachelor party at

the Park View Hotel.

RAJAH

You are being in luck. Customers in

same hotel. I let you have them at

cut-rate price for 45 minutes.

GARY

Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.

RAJAH

Not one minute longer or Milt will

come for you.

GARY

Milt?

RAJAH

This being Milt.

RAJAH

(continuing)

Girls back in 45 minutes or Milt

cuts your balls off. Fair enough?

Shake!

GARY

(to himself as he

walks to his car)

I just bet my balls and shook on it.

RICK

(concerned; calling

O.S.)

Larry! Yo, Larry.

RICK

(continuing)

What are you doing?

LARRY

I'm killing myself.

RICK

Larry... you've got to lighten up.

You and the wife can work it out.

RICK

Lar... sometimes when people are mad

they say things they don't mean.

LARRY

No, she hates me... I want to end

everything here... now.

RICK

You okay?

LARRY

Yeah, I guess so.

RICK

Really?

LARRY

Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon,

let's party.

RICK

(to himself)

He ain't all right.

MR. T

Hello?

COLE

Mr. Thomerson.

MR. T

Yes, son, did you find out where the

bachelor party is?

COLE

Yes I did.

MR. T

Fine. How's everything going?

COLE

Not so good. He wouldn't listen to

reason. He stole my car... my

Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

MR. THOMERSON

So, he's playing hard ball. Well,

two can play that game.

(yelling)

Go after him. Stop at nothing. You

hear me?

COLE

What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear

you.

COLE

(continuing)

Some fat slob in the next booth is

making a lot of noise.

MR. THOMERSON

Well, tell the asshole to shut up.

COLE

Right.

(calling off)

Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.

MR. THOMERSON

Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin

head's yelling...

(yelling O.S.)

Shut up, I'm talking here.

(into phone)

Now look, I want you to go back and

I don't care what you do. Stop that

marriage.

CHULO

Hey, man, your car's looking good.

COLE

(crazed)

Where is it?

CHULO

Out front.

COLE

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

COLE

(screaming)

Rick... Rick... Goddamn it.

RICK

Gee. I think that's for me.

COLE

Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always

be.

RICK

(yelling back)

Cole, when was the last time you had

a lobotomy?

COLE

(furious)

You've had it. I'm gonna get you.

RICK

(to guys)

Don't you love it when old friends

stop by?

O'NEILL

(to Rick)

Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get

something to eat. We'll bring back

food for everybody.

RICK

I'm not really hungry.

O'NEILL

C'mon. I insist.

RICK

...couple more on rye. Lots of

fries... and a burger and diet soda.

O'NEILL

Let's sit down.

RICK

What the hell is that?

O'NEILL

My gift to you.

RICK

Under the table!

O'NEILL

The best table in the house.

RICK

...I think we can skip the wine list.

Oh, gee...

FATHER FALWELL

Boys, good evening to you.

O'NEILL

Father Falwell, good evening.

RICK

Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss...

Oh, yesssssss!

FATHER FALWELL

So, Rick, soon you will be a married

man. How does it feel?

RICK

Innnnnn-credible!

FATHER FALWELL

Well, nice seeing you both.

RICK

Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God,

God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...

RICK

(continuing)

I was just saying grace.

FATHER FALWELL

How nice.

O'NEILL

You done?

HOOKER (O.S.)

Not yet.

RICK

Father, would you like to take our

table?

FATHER FALWELL

Yes. Thank you.

RICK

I think you'll enjoy this table.

O'NEILL

So long, Father.

O'NEILL

I don't get it. Why didn't you go

for it just now?

RICK

I don't know. Maybe it's because I

love Debbie or maybe it's hard for

me to get off in a place that smells

like egg salad. I'm not sure.

RICK

Where the hell is everybody?

GARY

Surprise!

(gesturing to the

girls)

The team bus just pulled in.

STAN

Hookers. It's a party!

RICK

All right!

KELLEY

Who's first, guys?

GUYS

Oh, me... me... me!

O'NEILL

Wait. The guest of honor should be

first.

RICK

Nah, that's okay. My brother has to

look up old people's asses all day

long. Let's give him a break.

STAN

Right. Give me the will to live. Let

me go first.

O'NEILL

A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead

off. I'll screw clean up.

RICK

How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.

CHULO

I have returned!

CHULO

(continuing; points

to her)

You! Mine!

RICK

(to O'Neill)

Chulo's got such a nice, light touch

with women.

O'NEILL

Terrific. You made it... You can set

up over there...

MR. THOMERSON

(to another)

Great bathing suit.

EXECUTIVE

(indicating Laverne)

I think I screwed that one once.

MRS. THOMERSON

I had his weiner right in my hands.

ILENE

I told you. Men are pigs... I saw

them standing there.

PHOEBE

What a gross thing to do... gawd!

ILENE

I bet right now Rick and his pals...

(she spits disdainfully)

...are knee deep in whores.

MRS. THOMERSON

A strange wang right in my palm.

DEBBIE

Ilene, we don't really know that.

BOBBIE

That's what we're going to find out...

DEBBIE

I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

ILENE

Good. That's just what we're doing.

TINA

I'll kill Stan if I find out he's

been screwing around.

ILENE

Brett, are you with us?

MRS. THOMERSON

(coming out of her

fog)

Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with

an unfamiliar pud.

RYKO

Hey, Gary, spot me.

STAN

Thanks a lot, that was the best.

You're next.

RICK

Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older

brother. I need some advice here.

What's the deal with marriage? What

can I expect?

STAN

Well, the first month it's great.

The second month things calm down a

little. By the third month you're

looking through your old girlfriends'

phone numbers; by the fourth month

you're numb; by the fifth month,

hopefully the football season starts.

RICK

Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of

help.

GARY

Hi.

SHE

Hello.

O'NEILL

You guys better get going. It's

getting late.

STAN

Oh, right.

GIRL

Is there a party going on in there

or something?

RYKO

Yeah. It's great. Go on in.

STAN

My God. Fresh meat. Let's hurry back.

RICK

What the hell are you doing?

LARRY

I'm trying to slash my wrists.

RICK

You're trying to kill yourself with

an electric razor?

LARRY

I couldn't find any razor blades.

RICK

Well, this is terrific. Now you're

gonna have wrists that are smooth

and kissable. Just go out there.

Forget about everything and laugh it

up.

LARRY

(suddenly laughs like

a crazy man)

Ha, ha, ha.

RICK

No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now,

forget about marriage for a while.

Go party.

RICK

Gary, how we doing, big stallion?

GARY

Rick, I really think I'm in love.

RICK

This is cause for celebration. She'll

probably charge half price for sex

from now on.

GARY

(into mirror)

This time it's real. She's wonderful.

SHE

The name's Tim. I'm always available.

SHE/TIM

By the way... I also do engine work

on BMW's. 'Bye.

RYKO

All right.

O'NEILL

Rick, I'm concerned.

RICK

About what?

O'NEILL

This is your bachelor party. You

haven't had sex with anyone yet.

RICK

(trying to joke his

way out of it)

Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance

and see what happens.

O'NEILL

I got something you can't resist. I

have a friend, Tracey. She wants to

meet you. She loves to please.

RICK

Oooooo.

O'NEILL

(indicating the bedroom)

Right in there, pal.

RICK

If I'm not out in a half hour, send

for the paramedics.

O'NEILL

That's the old Rick!

RICK

Hellooo!

RICK

(to himself;

overwhelmed by her)

Eat my chair!

TRACEY

Take me... please.

TRACEY/DEBBIE

You promised me, Rick. You promised

you wouldn't make love to anyone

else.

TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS

Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be

true; be strong.

RICK

I can't do it.

TRACEY/STAN

You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful!

KIDS

Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for

it!

TRACEY/DEBBIE

(pleading)

Don't Rick.

RICK

I can't do it. I love Debbie.

O'NEILL

How'd it go?

RICK

Put it to you this way -- you're

gonna have to pry her out of the bed

with a spatula, mister.

O'NEILL

I'm proud of you, lad.

RAJAH

(angry)

Am looking for this dunghead who

took my women... He is being liar to

me. 45 minutes way over.

RAJAH

(frightened)

Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt

on you. He get back bitches. Me? I

haul ass.

RICK

Who was that?

O'NEILL

I don't know.

RICK

(looking at arrow)

What's this?

O'NEILL

Got me.

RICK

(to new arrow)

How 'bout this?

O'NEILL

Still drawing a blank.

RICK

He look familiar?

O'NEILL

Very.

RICK

C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle.

We better put Cochise out of business.

LAVERNE

Stay away from me.

CHULO

I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't

worry. You look beautiful.

LAVERNE

(nervous)

Think so? I borrowed it from one of

the girls. I don't look too fat?

CHULO

You're an angel... A madonna.

STAGE MANAGER

You're on.

MC

All right, here is your question,

Miss... Er...

LAVERNE

Rivas.

MC

Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you

solve our country's present economic

problems?

LAVERNE

Who, me?

MC

Yes.

LAVERNE

That's a good question. From the way

I understand it, according to supply

side economics, when supply exceeds

demand, recession is the result.

That's why I think we should control

the credit markets and increase the

prime rate. That way, the consumer

price index will stabilize and we

will have economic recovery.

CHULO

How'd you know all that stuff? You're

a real brain.

LAVERNE

Nah, I used to fuck a librarian.

CHULO

Wow!

DEBBIE

I don't believe we're doing this.

MANAGER

Can I help you, ladies?

DEBBIE

Yes, we're looking for the Stahl

party.

MANAGER

Room 1002.

MANAGER

(to Bellboy)

Those guys are asking for it.

ILENE

You're making a big mistake.

MILT

Shut up. You still got another job

to do here.

MRS. THOMERSON

What kind of job? I'm a housewife.

DEBBIE

Quiet, Mother.

MILT

Get in there.

JAPANESE ONE

Nice looking quim, huh, Bob?

JAPANESE TWO

Yeah, you know me, Ray, I've always

been a sucker for redheads.

JAPANESE FOUR

Hubba-hubba.

BOBBIE

Let's get out of here, girls.

DEBBIE

Guys, take it easy. Guys.

RICK

This is it.

(he positions Tracey

outside the door)

Go get 'im.

COLE

Where the hell is he?

COLE

Yeah?

TRACEY

Make love to me... please.

RICK

T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have

ignition.

COLE (O.S.)

Hey!

O'NEILL

All set here.

COLE

You guys are never going to get away

with this.

RICK

We're just going to keep you in a

safe place until after the party.

RICK

Now, don't get into any trouble.

O'NEILL

Take care.

RICK & O'NEILL

Byeeeee!

RICK

(to Tracey)

Don't you wish you were a guy so you

could have fun like this?

MAN

Why don't you get comfortable?

MAN

(continuing)

There's a wonderful moon out tonight.

JAPANESE/RAY

(subtitled)

Hey, Bob, this beats the shit out of

sushi, doesn't it?

MAN

Babe, I didn't know anything about

that.

MC

All right, can we have our five

finalists, please.

CHULO

Good luck, Laverne.

MC

Thank you, Mr. Thomerson. Well, the

judges have made their decision, and

this year's Miss Moosehead Beer is...

MC

Laverne Rivas.

LAVERNE

(teary-eyed)

I can't believe it. This is the

happiest day of my life, and I owe

it all to him.

JUDGE

I know I've had that girl.

MR. THOMERSON

(looking at Chulo)

And I know that guy from somewhere,

too.

STAN

How the hell are we supposed to get

this donkey inside?

RYKO

I don't know.

STAN

What? I thought you told me you had

it all figured out.

RYKO

Maybe I did... I don't remember.

STAN

(through clenched

teeth)

I'd love to get you in an operating

room. Just once.

RYKO

Can you believe how perfect it fits?

STAN

Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both

be a size 138 regular.

O'NEILL

Hey, you guys...

RICK

Who's your friend?

STAN

(keeping it a surprise)

Oh... it's... er... the guys from

the beer convention. We're bringing

them to the party.

RICK

Great.

(to moose)

I was wondering, how do you guys go

to the bathroom in that thing?

RICK

(continuing)

Say no more.

MANAGER

I don't know which one of you did

this, but you're not going anywhere

till you clean up this disgusting

mess.

O'NEILL

(resigned)

Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel

or something?

MANAGER

I'll have the boy take your bags up.

MANAGER

(to couple)

Excuse me. I seem to have a hand

full of potty.

EXECUTIVE

Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We

appreciate it.

MR. THOMERSON

Any time, Al.

MR. THOMERSON

Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing

here? What happened?

COLE

(nearly hysterical)

The bachelor party's upstairs. They

made me get naked. They hung me from

the window so high up it was so scary

I fell down...

MR. THOMERSON

Take hold of yourself. What room are

they in?

COLE

1002.

MR. THOMERSON

All right, I'll go up there and take

care of this myself.

(disgusted)

You look awful, son. Go find yourself

some clothes.

COLE

Yes, sir.

RICK

Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.

LARRY

It's Bullwinkle.

O'NEILL

Gentlemen... Ladies... For your

viewing pleasure, meet Mike the

Magical Sexual Mule.

RICK

(surprised)

How about this, a Trojan donkey.

O'NEILL

And here's Mike's partner, in more

ways than one. A gal who doesn't

think happiness ends with primates.

The very lovely, Miss Desiree...

RICK

Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on

the donkey.

DESIREE

C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.

CHULO

(excited)

Hey, you guys, I'm getting married.

(to Laverne)

We're gonna make lots of kids.

CHULO

What the hell happened?

STAN

Drug overdose.

DESIREE

You mean it's...

STAN

Afraid so. I did everything I could.

LARRY

It's my fault. He's dead because...

I left those drugs...

RICK

It's really not all your fault. I

was talking to Mike earlier and he

had a lot of problems. Personal

things, you know. Made some bad

investments. At least now he's

peaceful...

O'NEILL

C'mon, we gotta get this thing out

of here.

MANAGER

(on phone)

Yes... I see... Of course we don't

allow that sort of thing here, ma'am.

No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke

you. I'll take care of it right away.

MANAGER

I've had enough of this.

MANAGER

(continuing)

That's it. I'm calling the cops.

RICK

Welcome, welcome, one and all.

MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)

Rick!

RICK

(recognizing the voice)

Oh, no!

RICK

Christ... it's Mr. Laughs.

MR. THOMERSON

This is it. You're through. When

Debbie hears about this she'll never

see you again. Now I'm calling the

cops to break up this sex orgy...

And toss your ass in jail!

O'NEILL

What are you going to do about it?

RICK

(defeated)

What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's

going to go crazy and end the whole

thing.

O'NEILL

I'll stop him... You stall him.

RICK

Mr. Thomerson!

RICK

(continuing; dramatic)

Please, no. Don't ruin my life.

Please!

RICK

(continuing)

It's not me. I was brought up on the

wrong side of the tracks. A victim

of my environment...

O'NEILL

Is that all the coke in the place?

LARRY

That's it.

O'NEILL

Good.

RICK

My poor old mammy had to take in

laundry. My pappy had to work 20

hours a day at the Pez Factory.

RICK

The end.

MR. THOMERSON

No sob story is going to change my

mind.

O'NEILL

The phone's all yours.

MR. THOMERSON

I never liked you. I've never liked

any of your friends. I've hated you

from the first time I saw you. And

now you are out of my life. You are

out of my life!

O'NEILL

Reach out and snort someone.

RICK

I'm saved. Let's party!

DEBBIE

Let's give them what they want.

PHOEBE

What?

DEBBIE

Let's go. Everyone inside.

BOBBIE

Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

DEBBIE

(herding in the last

Japanese)

Right in here. The big show starts

in one minute.

DEBBIE

Let's go.

ILENE

Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and

hold them off. The rest of you break

for it!

DEBBIE

Ilene, are you crazy?

ILENE

I know what I'm doing... Go!

ILENE

Gentlemen, the gods have answered

your prayers... Bonzai!

MRS. THOMERSON

I hope Ilene's all right.

DEBBIE

I hope those guys are all right.

O'NEILL

Guess who's here? Another surprise

guest.

RICK

Who?

O'NEILL

Debbie.

RICK

My Debbie?

O'NEILL

What's with her costume?

RICK

(continuing)

I don't know... Go up to her, make

like you don't know her and send her

into the other bedroom.

O'NEILL

You got it.

O'NEILL

(continuing)

Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't

think the groom's had you yet, has

he?

DEBBIE

No, not yet. Where is he?

RICK

I can't see anything.

DEBBIE

Don't turn on the lights, sugar.

(seductively)

I'll lead you around.

RICK

How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.

DEBBIE

Why don't you get undressed.

RICK

(singing)

It's a lovely day in the neighborhood.

It's a lovely day, it's a beauty,

would you be mine, could you be mine.

(he's now stripped

down to his underwear)

...Please won't you be my neighbor.

(as Mr. Rodgers)

Hi... Hi there... Today we're going

to learn about anatomy...

RICK

(continuing)

Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't

believe it!

DEBBIE

I can't trust you!

RICK

C'mon, I knew it was you.

DEBBIE

(holding back tears)

Rick, you're lying!

DEBBIE

(yelling over the

din; furious)

Let go of me!

RICK

(yelling back)

Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do

anything, hardly.

DEBBIE

The marriage is off. Now you can

screw around with your friends for

the rest of your life.

RICK

I don't want that. I want to be with

you.

DEBBIE

And I want to be with someone who

understands the meaning of the word

commitment.

RICK

I am committed. I love you.

DEBBIE

I don't believe you.

RICK

You don't believe me? Okay, fine.

RICK

(continuing)

People! Can I have your attention...

people!

RICK

(continuing)

I want to ask you all a question.

Have I had sex with anybody in this

room tonight?

RICK

(continuing)

Are you sure?

RICK

(continuing)

Thank you.

RICK

(continuing)

See? And these are not just ordinary

party-goers -- there are professionals

in this crowd -- I didn't want any

of them. You... You're what I want.

Understand?

DEBBIE

(melted)

Yes...

RICK

Great. Now, what do you want to do

about it?

DEBBIE

(sexy)

Let's get naked.

RICK

You're on.

DEBBIE

(shocked)

Daddy?

MR. THOMERSON

Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...

RICK

Of course, sir. That explains it.

Leather is a very good source of

vitamin E.

MANAGER

You're all under arrest. Open up!

RICK

(to everyone in the

room)

Your attention, please. May I be the

first to say, It's a raid!

RICK

(continuing)

I'm glad no one is panicking.

MANAGER

(to Police)

Break it in, boys!

MRS. THOMERSON

Ed! What are you doing here?

MRS. THOMERSON

(angry)

Ed... you're kinky!

MR. THOMERSON

The phone made me do it!

MRS. THOMERSON

(shocked)

You've been having strange sex...!

MR. THOMERSON

No, Brett, I...

MRS. THOMERSON

It's all right...

(proudly)

So have I.

MRS. THOMERSON

I've seen another man's diddly.

RICK

Cole, what the hell are you doing?

COLE

She's mine!

RICK

He's kidnapped her! Everyone into

the bus!

COLE

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

COLE

He and Debbie stand outside the

theater, which is a multi-plex cinema.

Fourteen movie theaters under one

roof. Prominent is a sign which reads:

"24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags

Debbie into one of the theaters. The

gang runs up to the theaters.

RICK

Fan out and look for them.

RYKO

Aw, I've seen this one already.

MAN

(to LADY next to him)

Gee, what a realistic effect.

WOMAN

Yeah, like you're in the movie with

them.

PATRON

(to his date)

Best 3D I've ever seen.

RICK

(to Debbie)

Are you okay?

DEBBIE

Yeah.

RICK

This has been quite a night. Here's

a thought. Why don't we go home and

give our private parts a workout?

DEBBIE

(hugging him)

You're so romantic...

WOMAN

Absolutely amazing.

MAN

I've seen better.

CHULO

(to Ryko)

Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor

party's next Friday night.

GARY

I'll get the hookers.

RYKO

No way.

MR. THOMERSON

(sotto; to Mrs.

Thomerson)

We'll have morons for grandkids.

(resigned to the fact)

But... at least we'll have grandkids.

LARRY

Sue!

SUE

Hi, honey.

LARRY

How'd you get here?

SUE

Rick called me.

LARRY

Why don't we go someplace and talk.

FATHER FALWELL

Now, before I pronounce you man and

wife, the groom wishes to recite his

vow to Debbie. Richard.

THOMERSONS

They fear the worst.

MR. THOMERSON

Oh, God Almighty.

RICK

Cheese. I love you more than cheese.

And I love cheese a lot.

THOMERSONS

They hide their faces in their hands.

Off in the distance a storm is coming

in fast over the ocean. The wind

begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick

continues his soliloquy.

RICK

In fact, more than dairy products in

general. I love dairy. My love is

cream. Pour me on the cereal of your

life...

FATHER FALWELL

Rick. Rick. Hey...

RICK

I think this song pretty much sums

up the way I feel at this moment.

FATHER FALWELL

(rapid fire)

I now pronounce you man and wife.

Goodbye.

RICK AND DEBBIE

"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones

They're a prehistoric family From

the town of Bedrock They're a page

right out of history..."

FADE OUT:

THE END
