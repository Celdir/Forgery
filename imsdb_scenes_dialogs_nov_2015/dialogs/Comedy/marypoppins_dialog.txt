The constable's "responstable." Now, how does that sound?

Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you.

Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.

Dear Miss Persimmon--

Like something is brewin' about to begin

Can't put me finger on what lies in store

But I feel what's to happen, all happened before.

And we'll sing in grateful chorus

"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

Though we adore men individually

We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

Our daughter's daughters will adore us

And they'll sing in grateful chorus

"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

One hears the restless cries

From every corner of the land: womankind arise

Political equality and equal rights with men

Take heart for Mrs. Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

No more the meek and mild subservients we

We're fighting for our rights, militantly - never you fear

Our daughter's daughters will adore us

And they'll sing in grateful chorus - "well done"

Much as a king astride his noble steed - thank you.

When I return from daily strife, to hearth and wife

How pleasant is the life I lead

I run my home precisely on schedule

At 6:01 I march through my door

My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

Consistent is the life I lead

It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

King Edward's on the throne it's the age of men

I'm the lord of my castle the sovereign, the liege

I treat my subjects, servants children, wife with a firm but gentle hand, noblesse oblige

It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed

Ah, lordly is the life I lead

A British nanny must be a general

The future empire lies within her hands

And so the person that we need

To mold the breed

Is a nanny who can give commands

A British bank is run with precision

A British home requires nothing less

Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

Without them, disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

In short you have a ghastly mess

If you want this choice position

Have a cheery disposition

Play games, all sorts

You must be kind you must be witty

Very sweet and fairly pretty

Take us on outings give us treats

Sing songs bring sweets

Never be cross or cruel never give us castor oil or gruel

Love us as a son and daughter

And never smell of barley water

If you won't scold and dominate us

We will never you give you cause to hate us

We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

Hurry, nanny

Many thanks

Sincerely

There is an element of fun.

You find the fun, and snap!

The job's a game.

And every task you undertake

Becomes a piece of cake

A lark, a spree it's very clear to see

That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

The medicine go down

Medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

In a most delightful way

A robin feathering his nest

Has very little time to rest

While gathering his bits of twine and twig

Though quite intent in his pursuit,

He has a merry tune to toot

He knows a song will move the job along

For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

The medicine go down

Medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

In a most delightful way

The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

And hence

And hence

They find

Their task is not a grind

For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

The medicine go down

Medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine

Go down in the most delightful way

I does what I likes and I likes what I do

Today I'm a screever and as you can see

A screever's an artist of highest degree

And it's all me own work

From me own memory

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

No remuneration do I ask of you

But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

Right as a mornin' in May

I feel like I could fly

Have you ever seen

The grass so green

Or a bluer sky

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

Mary makes your heart so light

When the day is gray and ordinary

Mary makes the sun shine bright

Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

No wonder that it's Mary that we love

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

Mary makes your heart so light

When the day is gray and ordinary

Mary makes the sun shine bright

Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

The daffodils are smiling at the dove oink, oink.

When Mary holds your hand

You feel so grand

Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

It's a jolly holiday with Mary

No wonder that it's Mary that we love

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

Gentlemen like you are few

Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

Underneath your blood is blue

You'd never think of pressing your advantage

Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed

A lady needn't fear

When you are near

Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

A jolly, jolly holiday with you

We'll start with raspberry ice

and then some cakes and tea

Order what you will

There'll be no bill

It's complimentary

When Mary holds your hand

You feel so grand

Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

It's a jolly holiday with Mary

No wonder that it's Mary that we love

No wonder that it's Mary that we love

No wonder that it's Mary that we love

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

Oh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

He's traveled all around the world and everywhere he went

He'd use his word and all would say, "there goes a clever gent"

When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

Ooh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

She's supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

La dum da da dum da da da da dum

Don't lie down upon your bed

While the moon drifts in the skies

Stay awake don't close your eyes

Though the world is fast asleep

Though your pillow's soft and deep

You're not sleepy as you seem

Stay awake don't nod and dream

Stay awake don't nod and dream

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

I love to laugh

Loud and long and clear

I love to laugh

It's getting worse every year

The more I laugh

The more I fill with glee

The more the glee

The more I'm a merrier me

The more I'm a merrier me

Some people laugh through their noses

Sounding something like this -- dreadful!

Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

Hissing and fizzing like snakes

Some laugh too fast

Some only blast

Others, they twitter like birds

And squeak as the squeakelers do

I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

And laugh too

We love to laugh

Loud and long and clear

We love to laugh

So everybody can hear

The more you laugh

The more you fill with glee

The more the glee

The more we're a merrier we

A British home requires nothing less

Tradition, discipline and rules

Must be the tools

Without them disorder, chaos, moral disintegration

In short you have a ghastly mess

That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

If they must go on outings

These outings ought to be

And popping through pictures

Have little use, fulfill no basic need

They've got to learn the honest truth

Despite their youth

They must learn

They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

A thousand ciphers neatly in a row

When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

Their little cup of joy should overflow

Tomorrow just as you suggest

Pressed and dressed

Jane and Michael will be at your side

Early each day to the steps of St. Paul's

The little old bird woman comes

In her own special way to the people she calls

Come buy my bags full of crumbs

Come feed the little birds show them you care

And you'll be glad if you do

Their young ones are hungry

Their nests are so bare

All it takes is tuppence from you

Feed the birds tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

Feed the birds that's what she cries

While overhead her birds fill the skies

All around the cathedral

The saints and apostles

Look down as she sells her wares

Although you can't see it

You know they are smiling

Each time someone shows that he cares

Though her words are simple and few

Listen, listen she's calling to you

Feed the birds tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

Though her words are simple and few

Listen, listen she's calling to you

Feed the birds tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

But if you invest your tuppence

Wisely in the bank

Safe and sound

Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

Will compound

And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

As your affluence expands

In the hands of the directors

Who invest as propriety demands

Majestic self-amortizing canals

Plantations of ripening tea all from

Tuppence prudently thriftily, frugally

Invested in the

In the Dawes, Tomes Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

That it blooms into credit of a generous amount semi-annually

And you'll achieve that sense of stature

As your influence expands

To the high financial strata

That established credit now commands

Tuppence patiently, cautiously trustingly invested in the

To be specific in the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

Or blow me a kiss and that's lucky too

Now as the ladder of life has been strung

You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

A broom for the shaft

And a brush for the flue

'Tween pavement and stars

Is the chimney sweep world

When there's hardly no day

Nor hardly no night

There's things half in shadow

And halfway in light

On the rooftops of London

Coo, what a sight.

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim

Chim cheree when you're with a sweep you're in glad company

Than them what sings chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

Chim chiminy chim chim cheree chim cheroo

A man has dreams of walking with giants.

To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

Before the mortar of his zeal

Has a chance to congeal

The cup is dashed from his lips!

The flame is snuffed a-borning.

He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

My world was calm, well-ordered, exemplary.

Then came this person with chaos in her wake

And now my life's ambitions go

With one fell blow

A spoonful of sugar that is all it takes

It changes bread and water into tea and cakes

A spoonful of sugar goes a long, long way

Have yourself a healthy helpin' everyday

And when your little tykes are cryin' you haven't time to dry their tears

and see them grateful little faces smilin' up at you

because their dad he always knows just what to do

You've got to grind, grind, grind at that grindstone

Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve

And all too soon they've up and grown

And then they've flown

And it's too late for you to give

Just that spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down

The medicine go down

Medicine go down

A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

The medicine go down

The medicine go down

The medicine--

The medicine go down

The medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar

With tuppence for paper and strings

You can have your own set of wings

With your feet on the ground

You're a bird in flight

With your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite

Oh, oh, oh

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite

And send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite

When you send it flying up there

All at once you're lighter than air

You can dance on the breeze

Over houses and trees

With your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite

Oh, oh, oh

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite
