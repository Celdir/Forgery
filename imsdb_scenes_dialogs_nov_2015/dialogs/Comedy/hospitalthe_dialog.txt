SHOOTING DRAFT

1971

NARRATOR

On Monday morning, a patient named

Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was

admitted to the hospital complaining

of chest pains.

NARRATOR

He had been referred by a nursing

home where the doctor had diagnosed

his condition as angina pectoris.

Now it is axiomatic that nursing

home doctors are always wrong.

NARRATOR

The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey,

however, accepted the diagnosis and

prescribed morphine, a drug suitable

for angina but not at all suitable

for emphysema, which is,

unfortunately, what the old man

actually had. Within an hour...

NARRATOR

...the patient became unresponsive

and diaphoretic and was raced up to

Intensive Care with an irregular

pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over

60, respiration rapid and shallow.

NARRATOR

The resident on duty now compounded

the blunder by treating the old man

for pulmonary edema. He gave him

digitalis, diuretics and oxygen.

This restored the old man's color...

NARRATOR

...and he was sent back to his room

in the Holly Pavilion, ruddy

complected and peacefully asleep.

NARRATOR

In point of fact, the patient was in

CO2 narcosis...

NARRATOR

...and died at seven-thirty that

evening.

NARRATOR

I mention all this, only to explain

how the bed in Room 806 became

available.

NARRATOR

The intern involved was a prickly

young buck named Schaefer who had a

good thing going for him with a

technician in the hematology lab. In

the haphazard fashion of hospital

romances, Dr. Schaefer had been

zapping this girl on wheelchairs,

stretchers, pantry shelves...

NARRATOR

...in the kitchen, in the morgue, in

the dark corners of corridors...

NARRATOR

...standing up, sitting down -- so

you can imagine what an available

bed meant to him.

SCHAEFER

(on phone)

Hey, Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila.

Hey listen. I got us a bed for

tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.

THE HOSPITAL

SHEILA

(whispers)

I'll see you.

FADE OUT.

NURSE PEREZ

Doctor Schaefer...

NURSE PEREZ

(trying again, with

little hope)

Doctor Schaefer?

NURSE PEREZ

Listen, did you know Doctor Schaefer

was in Eight-O-Six, because he's

dead?

MRS. REARDON

(late forties,

continues her

painstaking paperwork,

grunts)

What?

NURSE PEREZ

I'm just telling you, Dr. Schaefer

is dead.

MRS. REARDON

(works on; after a

moment, looks up)

What do you want, Perez?

NURSE PEREZ

Look, I don't know what the hell

this is all about, but Dr. Schaefer

is in Room 806 with an I.V. running

and he's dead. I didn't even know he

was sick.

MRS. REARDON

(regards Perez a moment)

Perez, what the hell are you talking

about?

(appeals to Nurse

Rivers coming out of

the floor pharmacy)

Do you know what the hell she's

talking about?

NURSE PEREZ

Well, maybe I'm going crazy. I don't

know. Isn't Room 806 the patient

Guernsey? I mean, did something happen

I don't know about?

MRS. REARDON

Perez, I don't know what you're

talking about.

NURSE PEREZ

This is the nuttiest thing I ever

saw. Dr. Schaefer's in Room 806 dead.

MRS. REARDON

What Dr. Schaefer? Our Dr. Schaefer?

NURSE PEREZ

Our Dr. Schaefer. The one who's always

grabbing everybody's ass.

MRS. REARDON

(to Nurse Rivers)

Do you know what she's talking about?

I don't know what she's talking about.

(to Perez)

What do you mean Doctor Schaefer's

in Room 806 dead?

NURSE PEREZ

I mean, he's lying on the far bed,

stone dead, and with an I.V. tube

sticking out of him. And if you don't

believe me, maybe you just ought to

get up and look for yourself.

MRS. REARDON

All right, maybe you'd better call

Mrs. Christie.

BOCK

This is Dr. Bock... Yes, Mrs.

Christie, what is it? It's all right,

I'd be getting up in a few minutes

anyway... I'm sorry I missed that.

Would you say it again? Yes, I know

him, Schaefer, the stud with the

glasses, who fancies the nurses...

I'm afraid I don't understand that,

what do you mean? Was he sick? I

mean, was he... uh, what was the

cause of death? Was he being treated?

I don't understand. What was he doing

in the bed? You did say he... Look,

Mrs. Christie, did you call the

office? Good, well, I'll... No, no,

it's all right. I'll be getting my

wake-up call any minute anyway.

GRUMBLING PROTESTERS

(chanting)

Two-four! Help the poor!

DR. IVES

What do you say, Sundstrom? How much

longer do you think our monopolistic,

exclusionary, racist policies will

work?

PROTESTER

We're the hope!

SUNDSTROM

So how's it going, Herb?

BOCK

(after a moment)

One of my interns dropped dead this

morning.

SUNDSTROM

Really? I'm sorry to hear that. I

understand you've moved out to a

hotel.

BOCK

Yes.

SUNDSTROM

It got that bad with Phyllis?

BOCK

It's been that bad for twenty-four

years. Are you going to be solicitous?

SUNDSTROM

Yes.

BOCK

Oh, God.

SUNDSTROM

Listen, Herb, I'm the guy who brought

you into this hospital, so I think I

can skip the diplomatic overtures.

Marty stopped me in the hall

yesterday, very upset. He had just

had lunch with you and said you

sounded suicidal. Marty tends to be

extravagant, but he's not the only

one. Jack Singer mentioned the other

day you've been boozing it up a lot.

And let's face it, you've been

sloughing off. I understand you

haven't even been doing rounds.

BOCK

I'm going to do rounds today.

SUNDSTROM

Herb, want a couple of days off?

BOCK

No.

SUNDSTROM

Go down to Montego Bay, get drunk,

get laid, get a little sun.

BOCK

For God's sake, John, I'm fifty-three

years old with all the attendant

fears. I just left my wife after

twenty-four years. Standard case of

menopausal melancholy.

SUNDSTROM

Maybe you ought to have a talk with

Joe Einhorn.

BOCK

I don't want to see a psychiatrist.

Stop worrying about me. All I have

to do is get my ass back to work,

and I'll be fine. I'm sorry I've

caused you concern.

MILTON MEAD

Sid just called from St. Luke's, and

he's heard that the demonstrators up

there are planning a march to join

the bunch down here.

SUNDSTROM

Oh, God.

(he wraps his arm

around Mead's

shoulders, ushering

him into his office

area)

Did you call the cops?

MILTON MEAD

Yes.

MRS. DONOVAN

(back to her paperwork)

They're all in Eight-O-Six, Doctor.

BOCK

What happened?

MRS. DONOVAN

I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie

tell you about it.

BRUBAKER

(as he approaches,

rolls his eyes)

Oh boy.

BOCK

What happened?

BRUBAKER

I've seen some pretty good snafus,

but this one... I mean, there's a

certain splendor to this one. One of

the night nurses, a float, thought

Schaefer was a patient and plugged

an I.V. into him. He was a diabetic,

you know.

BOCK

What do you mean, a nurse plugged an

I.V. into him?

BRUBAKER

Oh, it's really a screwed-up story,

Doctor. You see, what happened was

we had an old man in that bed who

died last night, so the bed was

available. And you know Schaefer.

He's Sammy Stud.

BOCK

And he talked a nurse into zapping

him on that bed.

BRUBAKER

I think it was a girl from hematology

he's been running with.

BOCK

My God, it's a Roman farce.

HITCHCOCK

I thought I heard you out here,

Doctor.

(he too rolls his

eyes heavenward in

an expression of

incredulity)

MRS. CHRISTIE

I'll need one from both of you, three

copies, and I suggest you do that

right now. The forms are in my

office...

MRS. DUNNE

I'm really so terribly sorry about

this, Dr. Bock. I...

BOCK

(regarding Schaefer's

rigid death mask)

As I understand it, one of the nurses

inadvertently administered an I.V.

to Schaefer here. How the hell could

that happen?

HITCHCOCK

Listen, I think we ought to straighten

this out somewhere else.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Yes, very good idea. Oh God, what a

mess.

MRS. CHRISTIE

(with a sigh)

Well, these things happen, of course.

HITCHCOCK

I suppose I'd better call the Medical

Examiner.

BOCK

I still don't know what happened.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Well, it took an hour to get it sorted

out. It seems a patient named Guernsey

died last night in Eight-O-Six, but

that information wasn't given to the

night nurses. These things happen.

MRS. CHRISTIE

(rattling on)

At any rate, according to the cardex,

the patient Guernsey was down for

twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-

6-H, so Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez

to give him his twelve o'clock shot.

Meanwhile, it seems Dr. Schaefer had

usurped that particular bed for his

own purposes. Dr. Brubaker suggests

it was for a love tryst, and some

weight is given that hypothesis by

the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.

BOCK

(trying to give his

attention to this)

I get the drift, Mrs. Christie. In

other words, Nurse Perez went in and

sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was

the patient Guernsey. My God! What I

don't understand...

MRS. CHRISTIE

If I may finish, Doctor. Well, after

Perez gave him his shot, she noticed

the I.V. on the bed had been pinched

off, and she reported that back to

Mrs. Reardon, who then assigned Nurse

Rivers to restart the I.V.

(Bock sighs)

Now Rivers was a float. She didn't

even know the staff people on the

floor, and nobody knew what the

patient Guernsey looked like anyway,

since he'd only been admitted that

morning.

BOCK

So she plugged an I.V. into him.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Yes.

BOCK

How much?

MRS. CHRISTIE

A liter.

BOCK

(The doctor in him

intrudes into his

lassitude)

A five percent glucose solution won't

kill anybody. Did he have any other

ancillary conditions? He wasn't

dehydrated, was he? Didn't anybody

bother to go in to check him during

the night, even under the impression

he was merely a patient? Was he

hyperasthmolic? Did he have a bad

heart? He must have had some kind of

thrombosis. I want the post done

here, Mr. Hitchcock. And you and I

better have a little chat, Mrs.

Christie, about your excessive use

of float nurses.

MRS. CHRISTIE

I've got nearly a thousand nurses in

this hospital.

BOCK

(gathering rage)

And every time one of them has her

period, she disappears for three

days. My doctors complain regularly

they can't find the same nurse on

the same floor two days in a row.

What the hell am I supposed to tell

that boy Schaefer's parents? That a

substitute nurse assassinated him,

because she couldn't tell the doctors

from the patients on the floor? My

God, the incompetence here is

absolutely radiant! I mean, two

separate nurses walk into a room,

stick needles into a man -- and one

of those was a number eighteen jelco! --

tourniquet the poor sonofabitch,

anchor the poor sonofabitch's arm

with adhesive tape, and it's the

wrong poor sonofabitch! I mean, my

God! Where do you train your nurses,

Mrs. Christie? Dachau!?

(he is aware his voice

has risen and is

attracting attention.

He lowers his voice)

All right, wrap him up and get him

down to Pathology. I'm especially

interested in his blood sugar. A

liter of glucose never killed anybody.

Your ladies must've done something

else to him.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Will there be anything else, Doctor?

BOCK

No.

HITCHCOCK

Before you call the family, Doctor,

I wish you'd talk to Mr. Mead about

this. We'd like, naturally, to avoid

litigation.

MISS LEBOW

(mouthing)

Coffee?

MISS LEBOW

A few things have been piling up.

Would you like to go into them?

MISS LEBOW

A quickie. Dr. Esterhazy wants to

start hiring temporary people to

cover the summer vacations. He says

last year some of the replacement

people didn't receive their checks

until they waited six months. He

wonders if you could do something

about getting these people paid more

promptly.

MISS LEBOW

(drones on)

Miss Aronovici complains the lab

reports are coming in slow into the

E.R. I called Dr. Immelman about

that, and she said three microscopes

have been stolen out of her lab in

the last two months. Charley Waters

also complains about pilferage. I've

clumped all those together for you...

(she lays a sheaf of

memos in front of

Bock, who stares at

them blankly)

Now, as you know, Doctor, we've agreed

to take over the local ambulance

cases as part of the hospital's

commitment to the community, and

it's created a serious overload in

the E.R. I don't know why this was

dumped in our lap, but...

BOCK

(staring at his desktop)

Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his

office yet.

MISS LEBOW

Which Dr. Einhorn? Ophthalmology or

Psychiatry?

BOCK

Psychiatry.

(suddenly stands)

Never mind. I'll look in myself.

BOCK

Is he in?

BOCK

Can you give me a few minutes, Joe?

EINHORN

(short, chunky,

bespectacled, late

fifties)

Of course.

BOCK

(ill at ease)

I've been having periods of acute

depression recently. Apparently,

it's becoming noticeable. A number

of people have remarked on it. Anyway,

John Sundstrom thought it might be a

good idea if I spoke to you about

it.

EINHORN

Do you want to sit down, Herb?

BOCK

No. I'm not good at confessional.

(he ambles around)

Well, what can I tell you? The last

year, two, three... it goes way back,

I suppose. I can remember entertaining

suicidal thoughts as a college

student. At any rate, I've always

found life demanding. I'm an only

child of lower-middle-class people.

I was the glory of my parents. My

son the doctor. Well, you know. I

was always top of my class.

Scholarship to Harvard. The boy

genius, the brilliant eccentric.

Terrified of women, clumsy at sports.

God, Joe, how the hell do I go about

this?

EINHORN

I understand you just separated from

your wife.

BOCK

I left her a dozen times. She left

me a dozen times. We stayed together

through a process of attrition.

Obviously sado-masochistic dependency.

My home is hell. We've got a twenty-

three-year-old boy I threw out of

the house last year. A shaggy-haired

Maoist. I don't know where he is,

presumably building bombs in basements

as an expression of his universal

brotherhood. I've got a seventeen-

year-old daughter who's had two

abortions in two years and got

arrested last week at a rock festival

for pushing drugs. They let her off.

The typical affluent American family.

I don't mean to be facile about this.

BOCK

I blame myself for those two useless

young people. I never exercised

parental authority. I'm no good at

that. Oh, God, I'm no good at this

either. Joe, let's just forget the

whole thing. I'm sorry I bothered

you.

EINHORN

How serious are your suicidal

speculations, Herb?

BOCK

(at the door)

I amuse myself with different ways

of killing myself that don't look

like suicide. I wouldn't want to do

my family out of the insurance.

EINHORN

Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia.

BOCK

A good toxologist would find traces.

Potassium's much better. Sixty milli

equivalent. Instantaneous. Of course,

then you're stuck with how to get

rid of the hypodermic. Forty milli

equivalent. Gives you plenty of time

to dispose of the evidence.

EINHORN

You seem to have given considerable

thought to the matter.

BOCK

You ought to know a man who talks

about it all the time never does it.

EINHORN

I don't know. I see a man who's

exhausted, emotionally drained,

riddled with guilt, and has been

systematically stripping himself of

his wife, children, friends, isolating

himself from the world. Are you

impotent?

BOCK

Intermittently.

EINHORN

What does that mean?

BOCK

It means I haven't tried in so long,

I don't know. Let's just drop the

whole thing, Joe. I feel humiliated

and stupid. All I have to do is pull

myself together and get back into my

work. I'm sorry I troubled you. Take

care of yourself. I'll see you.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOCK

All set?

BRUBAKER

Yes, sir.

BOCK

(to Brubaker en passant)

Who's that exotic group?

BRUBAKER

(murmurs)

You got me. They've been here about

an hour.

ONE YOUNG DOCTOR

I think they're with the old man in

Eight-O-Six.

BOCK

Dr. Perry said he picked the

tuberculosis and the liver nodes for

today, right?

BRUBAKER

Yes, sir.

BOCK

Good. Because that's the one I studied

up. A hell of a case.

BOCK

All right, who's presenting?

MRS. CUSHING

Is there anybody seated who hasn't

been to see me first? Is there anyone

here who hasn't given me their health

insurance number?

MRS. CUSHING

Emergency Room... Well, I don't know,

Sybil. What's his name?

MRS. CUSHING

Would you wait a moment, please. I'm

on the phone, can't you see I'm on

the phone?

(rummaging through a

stack of charts,

large paper forms in

quadruplicate)

...Of course not, do they ever?

(hangs up, takes two

charts from the desk,

pushes through the

waiting line)

Would you mind, please. I have to

get through, do you mind?

NURSE

(on phone)

Give me that one again... thirty-

two?

PARANOID LADY

They follow me everywhere. Three big

black men. Naked, completely exposed.

Right in the street. Hanging down to

their knees. Disgusting. They're

waiting out there for me now...

MRS. CUSHING

Did you call upstairs and tell them

to admit a patient named Mitgang?

MRS. ARONOVICI

(continuing to treat

the little girl)

The concussion?

MRS. CUSHING

I don't know. They just called me.

They said you didn't fill out the

chart. And where do you come off

sending anyone up to Admitting without

my okay?

MRS. ARONOVICI

Sally, would you get the fuck out of

here. The patient's in the Holding

Room. You want his Blue Cross number,

you go in and you get his Blue Cross

number.

MRS. CUSHING

Do you mind, please...

NURSE

O.P.D. wants to know how that

asthmatic they sent down is.

DR. SPEZIO

(just leaving the

group around the

junkie)

She's fine. We'd like to keep her

here a little while.

MRS. CUSHING

May I see you a moment, Doctor, if

you don't mind.

DR. SPEZIO

(sighs, calls back to

the triage nurse)

I'll be right back.

MRS. CUSHING

(thrusting some papers

at the doctor)

If you don't mind, Doctor, is this

your handwriting?

MRS. CUSHING

Am I supposed to read that? Was it a

sprain? Was it a broken wrist? I

can't read that scribbling. I mean,

I have to bill these people. I know

you doctors are the ministering

angels, and I'm just the bitch from

the Accounting Department, but I

have my job to do too. I mean, if

you don't mind, Doctor...?

DR. SPEZIO

(studies the paper)

The kid had a collar fracture. We

had him in the O.R. We reduced it

and we gave him a small cast.

MRS. CUSHING

(calls after him)

But did you give him a sling? You

must have taken X-rays. How am I

supposed to make up the charges?

MRS. CUSHING

Are you Mitgang?

MITGANG

I'm Mitgang.

MRS. CUSHING

Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield,

Mr. Mitgang, if you don't mind?

MRS. CUSHING

Do you have your card with you?

(no answer)

Do you know your number?

MRS. CUSHING

Mr. Mitgang, you're not leaving this

room until I have this information.

NURSE

(enters for some chore)

Will you leave that man alone?

MRS. CUSHING

(indicating the other

patient)

Do you mind if I at least ask this

gentleman to fill out his chart?

MRS. CUSHING

May I have your A.H.S. policy number,

sir?

MRS. CUSHING

(looming)

Do you carry Blue Cross? Blue Shield?

MRS. CUSHING

(as Spezio approaches,

with spiteful relish)

I think one of your patients in here

is dead, Dr. Spezio.

DR. SPEZIO

(enters the Holding

Room)

Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing?

MRS. CUSHING

Because he wouldn't give me his Blue

Cross number, Dr. Spezio.

DR. SPEZIO

Oh, Christ.

DR. SPEZIO

How the hell long has this man been

lying here? Isn't this that doctor

who came in around nine o'clock?

CHIEF ENGINEER

I mean, they gave me a hard time,

Con Ed. "For Pete's Sake," I said,

"this is a hospital. One of our

feedlines just blew..."

MILTON MEAD

Yeah?

(it's another

annoyance; he sighs

with irritation)

CHIEF ENGINEER

I mean, it's lucky we traced it in

time.

MILTON MEAD

(on phone)

No, I'll be right up.

(hangs up, stands)

Have we covered about everything?

ADMINISTRATIVE RESIDENT

Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts

with the O.R. schedule.

MILTON MEAD

He's supposed to see me about that.

MEAD'S SECRETARY

(looks up to Mead

from talking on the

phone)

This is the Emergency Room. One of

the doctors just died of a heart

attack.

MILTON MEAD

(pauses)

One of our staff?

MEAD'S SECRETARY

I think so.

MILTON MEAD

(to Hitchcock)

Tom, you want to go down to the

Emergency Room? One of our doctors

just died.

HITCHCOCK

What? Another one?

MILTON MEAD

Yeah, see what that's about.

(en passant to

secretary)

I'll be on Holly Eight. I'll be right

back.

DR. IMMELMEN

It's no longer pilferage, Milton.

It's reached the point of piracy.

That's the third microscope this

month.

MILTON MEAD

Why don't we get together on this

sometime this afternoon, Fran?

DR. IMMELMAN

One o'clock?

MILTON MEAD

One o'clock will be fine.

MRS. DONOVAN

(without pausing or

looking up)

Your brother's in the room, Mr. Mead.

MILTON MEAD

What room is it?

MRS. DONOVAN

Eight-O-Six.

MILTON MEAD

For heaven's sake, Willie, you're

going to be in the hospital for two

lousy days. What're you making such

a fuss about?

WILLIAM MEAD

You're supposed to be such a big

wheel here.

MILTON MEAD

There are no private rooms available.

If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh

off the cross, I couldn't get Him a

private room.

WILLIAM MEAD

I'm not going to stay in a room with

a dying man...

MARILYN MEAD

He's not dying. They'll screen him

off. You won't even know he's here.

MILTON MEAD

If you want a private room, go on

home, and I'll call you the first

one that comes up. But you're the

one who phoned me in a panic, you're

going on a vacation. For heaven's

sake, Willie, they'll cut this polyp

out tomorrow morning. You'll be home

Thursday, you'll be in Miami Friday.

Marilyn, will you talk some sense

into this lunatic?

MARILYN MEAD

Well, you said it, he's a lunatic.

WILLIAM MEAD

Big wheel, can't even get me a private

room.

MILTON MEAD

I'll get you a tranquilizer...

BOCK

...five, a full abdomen contrasted

to wasting elsewhere; six, ascites

with a protein content above four

grams; unexplained anemia, leukopenia,

unexplained elevation of the serum

gamma globulin level, especially

abnormal flocculation tests, and of

course, a positive P.P.D. All these

findings assume special significance

among Negroes. This has been a very

commendable workup, as commendable a

workup of an F.U.O. as I can remember.

The staff of this floor is to be

applauded.

(spots Brubaker among

the others)

It's a reportable case, Brubaker.

Write it up.

(a brief, rare smile)

Well, let's go have a look at the

girl.

SUTCLIFFE

Nurse! Nurse, who's the Senior

Resident on this floor?

NURSE

That would be Dr. Brubaker. But I'm

afraid he's at Chief of Service rounds

right now.

SUTCLIFFE

That's... this way?

BOCK

I wonder if there might not be some

correlation between hepatic

tuberculosis and drug addiction.

Presumably, there was an early

consideration of S.B.E.

BRUBAKER

(off-screen)

Yes, sir. We discounted it after

repeated blood cultures were negative.

BOCK

You, Ambler. Is that right, Ambler?

AMBLER

Yes, sir.

BOCK

What else do you look for in bacterial

endocarditis?

AMBLER

(nervous)

Some sort of embolic phenomena, sir.

BOCK

Good.

SUTCLIFFE

(flagging Brubaker)

Dr. Brubaker, I wonder if I could

see you for a moment?

BOCK

Still a little icteric. Who's got an

opthalmoscope?

BOCK

Did anyone note Roth spots?

BOCK

Well, don't worry about it. There

aren't any. Ambler, you're our big

man on S.B.E. What was the latex-

fixation?

BIEGELMAN

It wasn't done, sir.

BOCK

Don't you think that's an important

test to differentiate S.B.E. from

miliary T.B.?

BIEGELMAN

(off-screen)

No, s...

BOCK

Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.

AMBLER

Well, there's about a seventy percent

incidence of false-positive latex in

S.B.E.

BOCK

You have been reading up. If the

diagnosis were S.B.E., would a

positive latex indicate anything in

the therapy?

AMBLER

We'd expect the latex to become

negative.

BOCK

If...?

AMBLER

If the antibiotic therapy were

successful.

BOCK

Are you applying for your internship

here?

AMBLER

I'm not sure.

BOCK

Come and see me.

(to the patient,

helping her up)

Would you sit up for a minute?

BRUBAKER

We've got a little thing over here,

Doctor. The girl over there is the

daughter of the patient in Eight-O-

Six. He is at the moment comatose

and requires intravenous feeding and

meds.

BRUBAKER

The thing is, the daughter wants to

take the father out of the hospital

and back to Mexico where they live.

The patient's name is Drummond. He's

apparently a Methodist missionary,

and he and his daughter run some

kind of religious mission among the

Apache Indians. The daughter claims

to be a licensed nurse, so she can

give the necessary I.V. treatment. I

certainly don't think he should be

let out of this hospital. The

Attending -- he's the guy in gray

over there -- concurs.

BOCK

All right, wait a minute. Let me

have all that again.

BRUBAKER

As a matter of fact, Doctor, this is

Dr. Biegelman's case.

BOCK

Never mind the professional ethics,

what happened?

BRUBAKER

(sighs)

I don't know why I'm covering for

that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion

anyway.

(sighs and begins)

The patient, a man of fifty-six, was

admitted to the hospital ten days

ago for a check-up, in good health,

no visible distress. We did the

mandatory work-up on him. Blood

cultures, stool, L.E. preps, chest,

E.K.G., all negative. But there was

apparently some evidence of protein

in his urine. I don't know how that

sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever

found out about it. Maybe he had

some kind of deal with one of the

girls in the lab. Anyway, he turned

up the next day, conned the patient

into signing an authorization for a

biopsy...

BOCK

What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion?

BRUBAKER

Some post-grad fellow named Ives.

Elroy Ives. I never met him. He's on

one of the immunology research

programs.

BOCK

Are you trying to tell me some post-

grad fellow came up here and did a

biopsy on the patient?

BRUBAKER

Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman with

that old story about...

BOCK

...protein in the urine?

BRUBAKER

Yes, sir.

BOCK

And he biopsied the man?

BRUBAKER

And he nicked a vessel, and at two

o'clock in the morning, they woke up

Biegelman because the nurse found

the patient in shock. Biegelman called

the kidney people for a consult right

away. What was there to see? The man

was sour and bleeding. We spoke to

this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred

us to a surgeon named Welbeck...

BOCK

Welbeck?! That barber!

BRUBAKER

You ain't heard nothing yet. So we

finally got Welbeck around four in

the morning. He said, go ahead. So

they laid on the surgery for eight.

Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders

an I.V.P., clears him for allergies...

BOCK

...without actually testing.

BRUBAKER

Right.

BOCK

And the patient went into shock...

BRUBAKER

...and tubular necrosis. They lopped

out the bleeding kidney, ran him

back to the room, and we sat around

waiting for three days to see how

obstructed he was. Fever began spiking

like hell, euremia, vomiting, so we

arranged hemodialysis. He's putting

out good water now. But some nurse

goofed on his last treatment. A leak

in the tube, something. His blood

pressure plunged. They ran him right

up to I.C.U., checked out vital signs,

all normal except he's comatose.

That was two days ago.

BOCK

In short, a man came into this

hospital in perfectly good health,

and, in the space of one week, we

chopped out one kidney, damaged the

other, reduced him to coma and damn

near killed him.

BRUBAKER

Yes, sir.

BOCK

You know, Brubaker, last night I sat

in my hotel room, reviewing the

shambles of my life and contemplating

suicide. Then I said "No, Bock, don't

do it. You're a doctor, a healer.

You're the Chief of Medicine at one

of the great hospitals of the world.

You're a necessary person. Your life

is meaningful." Then I came in this

morning and find out one of my doctors

was killed by a couple of nurses who

mistook him for a patient because he

screwed a technician from the

nephrology lab...

BRUBAKER

Hematology, sir.

BOCK

And now you come to me with this

gothic horror story in which the

entire machinery of modern medicine

has apparently conspired to destroy

one lousy patient. How am I to sustain

my feeling of meaningfulness in the

face of this? You know, Brubaker, if

there was an oven around, I'd stick

my head in it. What was the name of

that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion

again?

BRUBAKER

Ives, sir. Elroy Ives. Somebody ought

to ream his ass.

BOCK

(barely containing

himself)

I'm going to ream his ass. And I'm

going to break that barber Welbeck's

back. I'm going to defrock those two

cannibals. They won't practice in my

hospital, I'll tell you that!

BRUBAKER

What'll I tell the girl, sir? She

says we have no legal right to stop

her from taking her father out. She's

willing to sign an A.O.R. form.

BOCK

Let him go. Before we kill him.

DR. LAGERMAN

Hi, Herb...

BOCK

Get me Dr. Gilley. Put him on page

if you have to. I want to talk to

him right now. I don't care if he's

operating.

(wheels around to

Miss McGuire)

And you get me some monkey named

Ives. Ives. I-V-E-S, first name Elroy.

He's in the Farkis Pavilion.

DR. LAGERMAN

Herb...

BOCK

I want to talk to you, Joe. Would

you mind coming into my office?

BOCK

Have you got some punk named Ives

rotating in your department?

DR. LAGERMAN

Listen, Herb...

BOCK

(sits at his desk)

I also want to know what the hell

kind of a dialysis room you're

running. I just came from...

BOCK

Yeah... Gilley? Put him on. Bock.

Didn't you tell me a couple of months

ago you were going to cut off all

privileges for that assassin, Welbeck?

Yeah. Wellbeck. He just butchered

another one of my patients... Oh,

come on, Harry! The man's a buccaneer!

I want him brought before the Medical

Executive Committee... He's in your

department, Harry, not mine. He's

putatively a surgeon!... I'll be

here!

(slams receiver down,

stares at Lagerman)

Listen, Joe, I think you should know

that you've got a research guy in

your department named Ives who's

been doing some very dubious biopsies.

We're having enough trouble squeezing

grants out of the Nixon

administration...

DR. LAGERMAN

Ives is dead, Herb. That's why I'm

here.

BOCK

What do you mean, Ives is dead?

DR. LAGERMAN

I mean he's dead. He had a heart

attack in the Emergency Room.

BOCK

He had a heart attack in the Emergency

Room?

DR. LAGERMAN

Yeah.

BOCK

(blinking)

What the hell is this? Some kind of

plague?

(stands)

Where is he now?

DR. LAGERMAN

They were just taking him down to

Pathology.

HITCHCOCK

...and the next thing anybody knew,

about three hours later, Mrs. Cushing

from Accounting came in and said

there was a dead man in the Holding

Room.

BOCK

You don't find anything grotesque

about all this?

HITCHCOCK

What do you mean?

BOCK

I mean, at half past eight this

morning, we meet over a doctor who's

been killed intravenously, and here

we are again, four hours later, with

another doctor who had a heart attack

in the Emergency Room.

HITCHCOCK

Well, what're you suggesting Doctor?

Do you think we have a mad killer

stalking the halls of the hospital?

Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart

attack and Schaefer in a diabetic

coma. People do die of these things.

It's all perhaps coincidental, but I

don't think I'd call it grotesque.

BOCK

How long are they going to be on

Schaefer's post?

BOCK

(pauses at door, to

Lagerman)

I don't suppose you'd like to call

next of kin?

DR. LAGERMAN

No thanks.

BOCK

(deeply depressed)

Oh God, I need a drink.

NURSE DEVINE

Mead.

NURSE DEVINE

(softly)

Mr. Mead... Mr. Mead, I have an

injection for you.

NURSE DEVINE

What the hell is going on in there?

NURSE DEVINE

Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor

in Eight-O-Six, and you better go in

there. You know that Indian that was

sitting in Eight-O-Six all night?

He's still there, and the girl's

there, and they're doing some voodoo

in there, and I ain't kidding.

MRS. DUNNE

(looking up)

What are you talking about?

NURSE DEVINE

I mean that Indian's in there, half-

naked and going pis-pis-pis with a

little bag. You just better get in

there, Mrs. Dunne.

NURSE DEVINE

(to NURSE WEITZENBAUM,

coming out of another

room)

You want to see somethin', baby? You

jus' come here.

BARBARA

(keeping her voice

low)

Look, it's a perfectly harmless

ceremony, nothing to get excited

about. It'll be over in a few minutes

anyway. Mr. Blacktree is a shaman

who gets his power from the thunder,

and it's imperative he conclude his

rituals while the storm is still

going on.

NURSE DUNNE

Visiting hours were over at nine

o'clock, Miss.

BARBARA

All that's going on in there, Doctor,

is a simple Apache prayer for my

father's recovery.

BARBARA

The markings he's made on my father's

arms are from the pollen of the tule

plant. The twigs have no significance

other than they've been struck by

lightning and are consequently appeals

to the spirit of lightning. It's all

entirely harmless, a religious

ceremony, not a medical one.

BOCK

You don't seriously believe all that

mumbo-jumbo will cure him?

BARBARA

On the other hand, it won't kill

him, Doctor.

BOCK

(grunts)

Okay. Go ahead.

BARBARA

Thank you.

BOCK

Miss Drummond, are you still taking

your father out?

BARBARA

Yes. I still have to arrange an

ambulance service. Is there a phone

around I could use?

BOCK

Use my office.

BARBARA

Thank you.

BARBARA

(on phone)

Hello. I'd like to arrange an

ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow

afternoon... Thank you...

BARBARA

(in background on

phone)

...Drummond, first name, Barbara.

I'll pay cash...

BARBARA

(on phone)

No, you're to pick up my father,

Drummond, Edward, at the Manhattan

Medical Center, Holly Pavilion, Room

Eight-O-Six. It's a stretcher case.

I presume you provide the stretcher.

BARBARA

He's to be taken to American Airlines,

Yes... No... Kennedy Airport, Flight

Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma, Arizona.

I'll accompany the patient... Yes,

thank you.

BOCK

You believe in witchcraft, Miss

Drummond?

BARBARA

I believe in everything, Doctor.

BOCK

Like a drink?

BARBARA

Yes.

BARBARA

(from the door suddenly)

My father, you should know, was a

very successful doctor in Boston, a

member of the Harvard Medical Faculty.

He was a widower, and I was his only

child. He was not an especially

religious man, a sober Methodist.

One evening, seven years ago, he

attended a Pentecostal meeting in

the commons rooms at Harvard and

suddenly found himself speaking in

tongues.

(she takes her drink

and crosses to the

sofa)

That is to say, he suddenly sank to

his knees at the back of the room

and began to talk fluently in a

language which no one had ever heard

before. This sort of thing happens

frequently at Pentecostal meetings,

and they began to happen regularly

to my father.

(she sits)

It was not unusual to walk into our

home and find my father sitting in

his office, utterly serene and happily

speaking to the air in this strange

foreign tongue. I was, at that time

twenty years old and having my

obligatory affair with a minority

group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a

post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing

his doctorate in the aboriginal

languages of the Southwest. One day,

I brought the Indian boy home just

as my father was sinking to his knees

in the entrance foyer in one of his

trances. The Indian wheeled in his

tracks and said, "Well, I'll be a

sonofabitch." You see, my father was

speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure

dialect at that, spoken only by a

ragged band of unreconstructed Indians

who had rejected the reservation and

were living in total isolation in

the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern

Mexico. Well! What do you say to

that, Dr. Bock?

BOCK

(who has been staring

at her as if she

were insane)

What the hell am I supposed to say

to that, Miss Drummond?

BOCK

I'm sitting here boozing and, all of

a sudden, you start telling me some

demented story about your father's

religious conversion.

BARBARA

No, no, you miss the point, Doctor.

Not my father's conversion -- mine.

You see, I had been hitting the acid

pretty regularly at that time. I had

achieved a few minor sensory

deformities, some suicidal despairs,

but nothing as wild as fluency in an

obscure Apache dialect. I mean, like

wow, man! I mean, here was living

afflatus right before my eyes! Within

a week, my father had closed his

Beacon Hill practice and set out to

start a mission in the Mexican

mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S.

card and my crash helmet and followed

him. It was a disaster, at least for

me. My father had received the

revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on

a mountain slope and preached the

apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians.

I masturbated a great deal. We lived

in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit

and crushed pinon nuts. It was

hideous. Within two months, I was

back in Boston, a hollow shell and

dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with

everything. I turned to austerity,

combed my hair tight and entered

nursing school. I became haggard,

driven and had shamelessly incestuous

dreams about my father. I took up

with some of the senior staff at the

hospital. One of them, a portly

psychiatrist, explained I was

generated by an unresolved lust for

my father. I apparently cracked up.

One day, they found me walking to

work naked and screaming obscenities.

There was talk of institutionalizing

me, so I packed a bag and went back

to my father in the Sierra Madre

Mountains. I've been there ever since.

That's three years. My father is, of

course, mad as a hatter. I watch

over him and have been curiously

content. You see, Doctor, I believe

in everything.

BOCK

Now what was that all about, Miss

Drummond?

BARBARA

I thought I was obvious as hell. I'm

trying to tell you I have a thing

for middle-aged men.

BOCK

I admire your candor.

BARBARA

You've been admiring a lot more than

that.

BOCK

(looks down again)

You're wasting your time. I've been

impotent for years.

BARBARA

Rubbish.

BOCK

(lurches about)

What the hell's wrong with being

impotent? My God, you kids are more

hung up on sex than the Victorians!

I've got a son, twenty-three. I threw

him out of the house last year.

Pietistic little humbug. He preached

universal love and despised everyone.

He had a blanket contempt for the

middle class, even its decencies. He

detested my mother because she had

petit bourgeois pride in her son the

doctor. I cannot tell you how

brutishly he ignored that rather

good old lady. When she died, he

didn't even come to the funeral. He

thought the chapel service an

hypocrisy. His generation didn't

live with lies, he told me. "Everybody

lives with lies," I said. I grabbed

him by his poncho, dragged him the

full length of our seven-room

despicably affluent middle-class

apartment and flung him out. I haven't

seen him since. But do you know what

he said to me as he stood there on

that landing on the verge of tears.

He shrieked at me: "You old fink!

You can't even get it up anymore!"

That was it, you see. That was his

real revolution. It wasn't racism

and the oppressed poor and the war

in Vietnam. The ultimate American

societal sickness was a limp dingus.

Hah!

(he lurches about,

laughing rustily)

My God, if there is a despised and

misunderstood minority in this

country, it's us poor impotent

bastards. Well, I'm impotent and

proud of it! Impotence is beautiful,

baby!

(he raises a militant

fist)

Power to the Impotent! Right on,

baby!

BARBARA

(smiling)

Right on.

BOCK

(stares drunkenly at

her)

When I say impotent, I don't mean

merely limp. Disagreeable as it may

be for a woman, a man may sometimes

lust for other things, something

less transient than an erection,

some sense of permanent worth. That's

what medicine was for me, my reason

for being. When I was thirty-four,

Miss Drummond, I presented a paper

before the annual convention of the

Society of Clinical Investigation

that pioneered the whole goddam field

of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm

in all the textbooks. I happen to be

an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And

you want to know something, Miss

Drummond? I don't give a goddam.

When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've

lost even my desire for work, which

is a hell of a lot more primal a

passion than sex. I've lost my raison

d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I

ever truly loved. It's all rubbish

anyway. Transplants, antibodies, we

manufacture genes, we can produce

birth ectogenetically, we can

practically clone people like carrots,

and half the kids in this ghetto

haven't even been inoculated for

polio! We have assembled the most

enormous medical establishment ever

conceived, and people are sicker

than ever! We cure nothing! We heal

nothing! The whole goddam wretched

world is strangulating in front of

our eyes! That's what I mean when I

say impotent! You don't know what

the hell I'm talking about, do you?

BARBARA

Of course, I do.

BOCK

I'm tired, I'm terribly tired, Miss

Drummond. And I hurt, and I've got

nothing going for me anymore. Can

you understand that?

BARBARA

Yes, of course.

BOCK

Then can you understand that the

only admissable matter left is death?

BARBARA

Sounds to me like a familiar case of

morbid menopause.

BOCK

Oh Christ.

BARBARA

Well, it's hard for me to take your

despair very seriously, Doctor. You

obviously enjoy it so much.

BOCK

Oh, bugger off. That's all I need

now, clinical insights. Some

cockamamie twenty-five-year-old...

BARBARA

Twenty-seven.

BOCK

...acidhead's going to reassure me

about menopause now. Look, I'd like

to be alone, so why don't you beat

it? Close the door and turn off the

lights on your way out.

BARBARA

(crossing to the door)

Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my

miniskirt, but it was the only thing

I had to come to the city with. Back

at the tribe, I wear ankle-length

buckskin.

BOCK

Swell. Just close the door and turn

off the lights.

BARBARA'S VOICE

(off-screen)

What're you shooting, Doc?

BOCK

(barely gets the words

out)

Leave me alone...

BARBARA

Potassium. You take enough of this

stuff, it'll kill you, Doc.

(moves toward the

couch)

It occurred to me that I might have

read you wrong, that you really were

suicidal. So I came back.

BOCK

(hysterical rage)

Who the hell asked you!

BOCK

Who the hell asked you!

BOCK

Leave me alone! Why the hell don't

you leave me alone!

BOCK

Why didn't you let me do it? Who the

hell asked you!

CAMPANELLA

Well, I'll see you.

CAMPANELLA

Do you have a match, Doctor?

BOCK

You wouldn't be awake.

BARBARA

What time is it?

BOCK

I swiped this for you out of the

nurses' locker room. I'll make good

on your dress. I'm afraid it's torn

beyond repair. Buy yourself a new

one or, if you like, give me your

size and I'll send it on to you. But

I want to talk to you about that.

BARBARA

Talk to me about what?

BOCK

About your father. You really

shouldn't move him in his condition.

I just had a look at his chart.

There's no reason to presume brain

damage. You know as well as I you

can't predict anything in these

instances. He could pull out of that

coma at any time. I think you should

let him stay here. I'll personally

look after him.

BARBARA

Is this your way of saying you'd

like me to stay in town a few more

days?

BOCK

Well, that would be nice, too.

BOCK

What do you say, Miss Drummond?

BARBARA

I expect you can call me Barbara,

considering you ravished me three

times last night.

BOCK

Three times?

BARBARA

Oh, look at him, pretending he didn't

count. You were as puffed up as a

toad about it. Punched a couple of

holes in your crusade for universal

impotence, didn't it? I think we're

on a first name basis by now. I'll

call you Herb.

BOCK

Let's give your father a week,

Barbara, what do you say?

BARBARA

(a frown darkens her

face)

No, I don't want my father in this

hospital. I had a dream about this

hospital.

(some of the terror

shows on her face)

I dreamt this enormous starched white

tile building suddenly erupted like

a volcano, and all the patients,

doctors, nurses, attendants,

orderlies, the whole line staff, the

food service people, the aged, the

lame -- and you right in the middle --

were stampeding in one hideous

screaming suicidal mass into the

sea.

(she stares at him

wide-eyed, reliving

the dream)

I'm taking my father out of here --

and as quickly as I can.

BOCK

You're a real fruitcake, you know?

BARBARA

Well, let me put it this way. I love

you. I fancied you from the first

moment you came lumbering down that

hallway upstairs. I said to Mr.

Blacktree, "Who's that hulking bear

of a man?" The Apaches are reverential

about bears. They won't eat bear

meat; they never skin bears. Bear is

thought of as both benign and evil,

but very strong power. Men with bear

power are highly respected and are

frequently said to be great healers.

BARBARA

I said to Mr. Blacktree, "That man

gets his power from the bear."

BOCK

Swell. Now, look, do you have a hotel,

some sort of accommodations where

you can stay for a week or so?

BARBARA

All right, let me put it this way,

Herb. My father and I accept the

implacability of death. If he dies,

he dies, but I'm taking him out of

here and back to Mexico about one

o'clock this afternoon. I want you

to come with us, because I love you

and want children.

BOCK

I'm afraid Mexico sounds a little

too remote for me.

BARBARA

We could use you down there, you

know. There's a curiously high

incidence of T.B. And you'd be a

doctor again, Herb. You'd be necessary

again. If you love me, I don't see

what other choice you have.

BOCK

What do you mean, if I love you? I

raped you in a suicidal rage. How

did we get to love and children all

of a sudden?

BARBARA

Oh, for heaven's sake, Herb, I ought

to know if a man loves me or not.

You must have told me half a hundred

times last night you loved me. You

murmured it, shouted it; one time,

you opened the window and bellowed

it out into the street.

BOCK

I think those were more expressions

of gratitude than love.

BARBARA

Gratitude for what?

BOCK

Well, my God, for resurrecting

feelings of life in me I thought

dead.

BARBARA

Well, my God, what do you think love

is?

BOCK

Okay, I love you, and you love me.

I'm not about to argue with so

relentless a romantic. Well, then,

since we have this great passion

going for us, I don't see why you

won't stay on here in New York for a

week or ten days...

BARBARA

It's up to ten days now.

BOCK

As long as it takes for your father's

condition to improve.

BARBARA

No. I've had these prophetic dreams

for seven nights. Seven is a sinister

number. The meaning of these dreams

is very clear, seven times as clear.

I am to get my father and you out of

this hospital before we are all

destroyed.

BOCK

(throws up his hands)

You're certifiable! My God, half the

time you're a perfectly intelligent

young woman, and then suddenly you

turn into a goddam cabalist who

believes in dreams, witchcraft and

bear power! And I don't like the way

you dismiss my whole life as

unnecessary. I do a lot of healing

right here in Manhattan. I don't

have to go to Mexico for it. I also

teach. I send out eighty doctors a

year into the world, sometimes

inspirited, at least competent. I've

built up one of the best damned

departments of medicine in the world.

We've got a hell of a heart unit

here and a hell of a kidney group. A

lot of people come into this hospital

in big trouble, Miss Drummond, and

go out better for the experience. So

don't tell me how unnecessary I am.

BARBARA

(who's been slipping

into the nurse's

uniform)

Yeah?

BOCK

Yeah.

BARBARA

So how come, eight hours ago, you

were trying to kill yourself with an

overdose of potassium?

BOCK

Where are you going now?

BARBARA

(gathering her coat

and purse)

My hotel. I have to check out. Mr.

Blacktree doesn't speak any English.

BOCK

(from the connecting

doorway)

Well, you're coming back, of course.

BARBARA

Of course. I have to settle the bill

here and pack my father. And I think

you need a few hours alone to make

your decisions.

BOCK

What decisions?

BARBARA

You're a very tired and very damaged

man. You've had a hideous marriage

and I assume a few tacky affairs

along the way. You're understandably

reluctant to get involved again.

And, on top of that, here I am with

the preposterous idea you throw

everything up and go off with me to

some barren mountains of Mexico. It

sounds utterly mad, I know. On the

other hand, you obviously find this

world as desolate as I do. You did

try to kill yourself last night. So

that's it, Herb. Either me and the

mountains or the bottle of potassium.

I'll be back in an hour or so. I'll

be in my father's room.

BOCK

All right. I love you!

(softly)

My God!

POLICE CAPTAIN

I repeat. I'm asking you to come out

peacefully. These buildings are

condemned and unfit for habitation.

POLICE CAPTAIN

(sighs, tries again)

You people are possessing this

building illegally and in violation

of the law. I'm asking you to come

out peacefully...

MRS. BASSEY

(reading)

...complete sympathy with the tenants.

So the hospital has assumed the

responsibility of finding 400 housing

units in good buildings. The hospital

wishes to point out that this

particular row of buildings on First

Avenue was condemned by the City

before the hospital acquired

ownership, and even then, only after

responsible leaders in the community

had approved the building of our new

drug rehabilitation center.

SUNDSTROM

(explodes on the phone)

Goddammit, Barry, I've got a dozen

community leaders waiting for me in

the library! We've been trying to

work out some kind of negotiable

formula for two years! And with no

help from you people in the Urban

Affairs Division, I might add!

SUNDSTROM

(hardly notices Welbeck)

And I'm not going to throw all that

down the drain because some cockamamie

activist group is show-boating for

the television cameras! You get those

people out of those buildings before

a wall collapses or a fire breaks

out and we've got a riot on our

hands!... Okay!

WELBECK

(smiles, twinkles)

Having your troubles, eh? Well, I

won't take much of your time. My

name's Welbeck. I've been associated

with this hospital for six years,

and, yesterday afternoon, Dr. Gilley

called me to say he was cutting off

my privileges at the hospital. Do

you know anything about it?

SUNDSTROM

(glances at his watch)

It's news to me.

WELBECK

He said he sent the report on.

SUNDSTROM

I'll probably get it tomorrow. Report

on what?

WELBECK

Well, I'm not sure myself. I did a

nephrectomy on a man about seven

days ago. Emergency, called in at

four in the morning. The man was

hemorrhaging, he'd gone sour...

SUNDSTROM

Welbeck, I'm terribly sorry, but I

do have this meeting.

(crosses to the door)

In any event, there's nothing I can

do about it. If Gilley wants to cut

your privileges, he's Chief of

Surgery, it's within his province.

You'll have to have the hearing...

WELBECK

I have a laparotomy laid on for this

morning. I assume I'll be allowed to

go through with that.

SUNDSTROM

Of course.

WELBECK

(huffing a little)

I've been associated with this

hospital for six years...

SUNDSTROM

Now, now, Welbeck. It seems to me

I've had your name down here before

for something...

(to his secretary en

passant)

I'll be in the staff room.

SUNDSTROM

Wait a minute. You're the fellow

with the Medicaid collecting business

who incorporated and went public,

right? I mean, something like that?

Milton Mead was telling me about you

just the other day. You're a whole

medical conglomerate. You've got a

Factoring service, a computerized

billing company, and a few proprietary

hospitals, a few nursing homes. Good

heavens, Welbeck, you shouldn't be

brought up before a committee of

mere doctors. You should be

investigated by the Securities and

Exchange Commission. You'll have to

go through with the hearing, Welbeck.

I don't interfere in these things.

VOICES

(all overlapping)

...no goddam halfway house, no way,

baby! We ain't gonna wait 'til 1973

to deal with this problem! We want

to kill the drug thing right now!...

imperializing the Blackaporican

community, and we reject the bourgie-

ass middle-class black traitors and

flunkies who are selling out the

Blackaporican proletariat masses to

the expansionist, racist policies of

this shit hospital!...

WOMAN

Let's get back to the abortion issue!

VOICE

Sit down, Woman!

WOMAN

What the hell does the male

establishment know about abortions?

BLACK WOMAN

Who the hell raised the issue of

birth control? The issue at hand is

the control of drug addiction in

this community and in the ghetto

generally.

BLACK MAN

We don't want no goddam abortion...

WHITE DOCTOR

Let's... let's get down to the core

of this matter.

MAN

The point is that this hospital is

the landlord for those buildings and

they should've turned them down.

MAN

Those buildings are imperialistic

extensions of the medical

establishment. This hospital ought

to be rebuilding those tenements,

give those people decent housing.

SUNDSTROM

Please, please, please!

WILLIAM MEAD

(under sedation)

You know, I hallucinated last night.

I hallucinated there was an Indian

doing a war dance in here.

NURSE CHILE

(affably)

You weren't hallucinating, Mr. Mead.

There was an Indian in here last

night.

WILLIAM MEAD

(staring through his

sedation at her)

There was?

NURSE

Dr. Norris says about half an hour.

SECOND NURSE

Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian

cyst.

THIRD NURSE

Shirley, it was just an ovarian cyst!

VOICE

(off-screen)

Oh, thank God.

MRS. KIMBALL

(handing the orderly

a slip)

All right, Jerry, go up to Holly

Six.

ORDERLY

(to Mrs. Kimball)

William Mead from Holly Eight.

MRS. KIMBALL

Hold him there, Tom. We've got

somebody coming out right now.

MRS. KIMBALL

(to this nurse)

Who's that? Mangafranni?

CIRCULATING NURSE

(checking wristband)

Yeah.

(to orderly)

Number three, Marty.

RESIDENT

It's legal for a doctor to incorporate

in New York, isn't it, Doctor?

WELBECK

(en route to phone)

Since last September. If they had

that when I was your age, I'd have

put away a couple of million by now.

(dials)

It gives you a variety of deferral

devices, profit-sharing for example.

Let's say you pick yourself an October

31-fiscal. You declare a bonus payable

in '71. An accrued item payable to a

principle share-holder must be paid

within two and half months after the

close of the year to get the deduction

in the prior year. But your

corporation doesn't pay that tax,

because we've eliminated the taxable

income with the bonus. With two

taxable entities, you can bury a

hell of a lot of expenses...

(on phone)

Hello, this is Welbeck, any

messages?... Well, I'm at the

hospital. I have to cut open some

guy in a couple of minutes. I'll try

to make it as fast as I can. How

urgent did he say it was?... Well,

Dr. Hogan made those arrangements

with the underwriters. The

Registration Statement was filed

with the S.E.C. well over a year

ago... If he calls again, have me

paged here.

(hangs up, turns back

to the attentive

young doctors to

conduct his class in

medical finance while

changing into surgical

scrub)

The really big money is in health

leasing, of course. Dr. Hogan, the

eminent orthopedic surgeon, and I

incorporated a leasing company and

went public last year. I hold a

controlling interest in a number of

proprietary hospitals, nursing homes

and rest farms, and I've been leasing

hospital equipment to my own hospitals

at excessive rates. Why, you ask, am

I draining my own hospitals? Well,

my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent,

and I'm giving my leasing company a

hell of a price-earnings ratio,

which'll balloon the market value of

the stock. I hold three hundred

thousand shares of that stock,

lettered of course, but in a year,

I'll dump those shares at a capital

gain and walk off with a bundle...

DR. MALLORY

Mangafranni, right?

SCRUB NURSE

Right.

DR. MALLORY

(grumbles to one of

the residents)

What do you say, huh? We're not going

to hang it in the Louvre, you know.

DR. CHU

Bring a mask over.

RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST

There's no pulse, Doctor.

DR. CHU

What's the pressure?

RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST

There's no blood pressure, Doctor.

DR. CHU

No pulse. Get the tube and E.K.G.

DR. MALLORY

What's the matter?

RESIDENT

I can't feel a thing, sir.

DR. MALLORY

What the hell happened?

DR. CHU

I don't know. She must have thrown

an embolus. She was doing fine up to

now.

(to Resident

Anesthesiologist)

Did you check the gasses?

RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST

I did, sir.

DR. CHU

The only time I ever saw anybody

conk out like this, some jerk switched

the nitrous oxide and the gas lines.

DR. MALLORY

Get the damn leads on. For Chrissakes,

what the hell is this?!

RESIDENT

She's just a young woman, sir. Do

you think we should open the chest?

DR. MALLORY

(defibrillating)

She's fifty-three, you buttonhead!

RESIDENT

(off-screen)

Bicarb?

DR. CHU

She's fibrillating, Doctor.

DR. MALLORY

Jesus H. Christ!

DR. CHU

Okay, stop for a minute... Doctor...

DR. MALLORY

(barking at the scrub

nurse)

You got those paddles ready?

DR. CHU

I may be crazy, Doctor, but I don't

think this is your patient.

DR. MALLORY

What the hell are you talking about?

BOCK

Now, I don't want to get into an

institutional hassle with you, Mrs.

Christie. The malpractice here is

monumental. As you see, Dr. Schaefer's

blood sugar was twenty-three. No

glucose solution is going to do that.

The only thing that will do that is

at least fifty units of insulin,

probably more. The only presumption

is that one of those nurses on the

Eighth Floor shot fifty units of

insulin into Schaefer's blood stream,

either by injection or through the

I.V., although how in God's name...

MRS. CHRISTIE

I'm very sorry, Doctor.

(reaches for a phone)

May I?

MISS MCGUIRE

(to Bock)

Doctor, did you ask the head nurse

on the eighth floor to let you know

when a Miss Drummond got there?

BOCK

Yes.

MISS MCGUIRE

Well, she just got there.

BOCK

Thank you.

MRS. CHRISTIE

(on phone)

Oh, dear me, Dorothy. I better get

right down there directly. Have you

called the O.O.D.? And you better

call Dr. Gilley. And you better call

Mr. Sloan... Yes, I'll be down

directly.

(hangs up; to Bock)

I'm very sorry, Doctor, but there's

a real nasty one in the O.R. They've

just operated on the wrong patient...

MRS. KIMBALL

(on phone)

...well, I don't understand, is she

back in her room? When did she get

back to her room? Who brought her

back?...

(she stares at

Hitchcock)

She's back in her room.

HITCHCOCK

Who?

MRS. KIMBALL

Mrs. Mangafranni, the woman who was

supposed to have been operated on...

(calls to a nurse

passing)

Are they still working on that woman

in Three?

NURSE

Yeah.

MRS. KIMBALL

(back on phone)

I'm sorry, Mrs. Fried, would you say

that again?... Well, nobody in this

office sent her back up... Well, all

right, Mrs. Fried, I'll have to call

you back.

MRS. KIMBALL

Did any of you take a woman named

Mangafranni out of the Holding Room

back up to Holly Five around ten

o'clock?

MRS. CHRISTIE

(to Hitchcock in the

doorway)

What happened?

MRS. KIMBALL

(to Mrs. Christie)

I don't know what happened. A patient

named Mangafranni was scheduled for

a hysterectomy at ten o'clock -- Dr.

Mallory. I talked to Sylvia in the

Holding Room who admitted her, so

she was here. And now I just spoke

to Mrs. Fried on Holly Five, and she

says an orderly brought Mrs.

Mangafranni back to her room about

twenty minutes ago. Now Mrs.

Mangafranni is in her room sleeping.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Well, who's the woman in the operating

room?

MRS. KIMBALL

I don't know.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Is she dead?

MRS. KIMBALL

Well, they had to open her up, and

that's not good.

HITCHCOCK

I better get Mr. Mead.

LADY FROM WOMEN'S LIB

...abortion? The clinic should be

under the supervision and entirely

staffed by women and administered by

a member of the Women's Committee

for Medical Liberation!

YOUNG WHITE ACTIVIST

...let's get to the core of the matter

which is the criminal and gangster

collusion between the American medical

establishment and the drug, insurance

and tobacco companies who, through

their combined racketeering efforts,

have produced a dual system of health

care. Everything for the rich and

nothing for the poor!

BLACK PANTHER

...abortion clinic! That's genocide,

baby! You're just killing off blacks!

We consider proliferation elemental

to the class struggle!

SUNDSTROM

(who has lost his

cool altogether and

is screaming right

along with everyone

else)

...for God's sake! We've got eleven

people in these buildings, and we've

got to get them out of there! We can

rectify the injustices of the world

tomorrow, but right now, for God's

sake, can we get those people out of

those buildings? Will you people

please listen to me? Will you people

please shut up and listen to me?

Will you people please call a halt

to this participatory democracy and

address ourselves to the immediate

problem?!

MILTON MEAD

How long ago did this happen?

HITCHCOCK

About half an hour.

MILTON MEAD

Have you called the Medical Examiner?

HITCHCOCK

Not yet.

MILTON MEAD

Well, you'd better do that now. And

you better call the precinct station

house as well.

DR. CHU

Good morning.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Good morning, Doctor.

DR. CHU

This is really something, isn't it?

I thought she looked a little

different when they brought her in.

I even said to one of the nurses,

"She looks a little younger without

her dentures." I'd only talked to

her half an hour before.

MRS. CHRISTIE

Does anybody know who she is?

MRS. CHRISTIE

(to Mrs. Kimball,

examining the chart

dangling from the

operating table)

What's her chart say?

CIRCULATING RESIDENT

Her chart says Mangafranni. Her

bracelet says Mangafranni. The only

thing that isn't Mangafranni is the

woman.

DR. MALLORY

Jesus H. Christ! I've been chopping

out three uteruses a day for twenty

years, and is it too much to expect

for you people to bring in the right

goddam Jesus Christ uterus?!

DR. CHU

I had just been talking to her in

the Holding Room. She was perfectly

fine. A little drowsy. I thought it

was funny that when they brought her

in, she was out cold.

DR. MALLORY

(shuffling around in

aimless circles)

Jesus H. Kee-rist!

MRS. CHRISTIE

Well, we'll just all have to stay

here until Mr. Mead or someone from

the O.O.D. comes back.

DR. MALLORY

Well, I'm not taking the rap for

this! I've already got one malpractice

suit pending, and I'm not taking the

rap for this one!

BOCK

Look, you're not going. I love you,

and I'm not going to let you go.

BOCK

Come on, let's start putting your

father's things back. He's staying

here.

(hangs the suit in

the closet)

I'll find an apartment somewhere.

I'm staying in a filthy little hotel

room. We can't use that.

BARBARA

I can't make it here, Herb. I'll

crack up. I cracked up once already.

One week here, and I'd be running

naked through the streets screaming

again. I can retain my sanity only

in a simple society.

BOCK

For God's sake, Barbara, you can't

seriously see me living in a grass

shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner?

Be sensible for God's sake.

BARBARA

I am being sensible. What is it you're

so afraid of leaving here? Your

plastic home? Your conditioned air?

Your synthetic clothes? Your instant

food? I'm offering you green silence

and solitude, the natural order of

things. Mostly, I'm offering me. I

think we're beautiful, Herb.

BOCK

(utterly in love)

You make it sound almost plausible.

BARBARA

I don't know why you even hesitate.

What's holding you here? Is it your

wife?

BOCK

No, that's all over. I suppose if

I'm married to anything, it's this

hospital. It's been my whole life. I

just can't walk out on it as if it

never mattered. I'm middle-class.

Among us middle-class, love doesn't

triumph over all. Responsibility

does.

BARBARA

Herb, don't ask me to stay here with

you, because I love you, and I will.

And we'll both be destroyed.

BARBARA

I've got the bill here to pay yet.

BOCK

I'll come with you.

LAGERMAN

Herb, you asked me to find that

dialysis nurse.

BOCK

What dialysis nurse?

BARBARA

I'll go pay the bill.

LAGERMAN

The one who goofed on your patient,

Drummond.

LAGERMAN

Well, her name is Theresa Campanella,

but you are not going to believe

this, Herb. She died on the operating

table in O. R. Three about an hour

ago.

BOCK

What do you mean, she died on the

operating table in O.R. Three?

BOCK

You mean she was the one?

LAGERMAN

That's the one. I just identified

her.

BOCK

What the hell's going on around here?

Every time I try to find somebody in

this hospital, they either died of a

heart attack in Emergency or of

anesthesia shock in an operating

room.

LAGERMAN

Listen, I just came from the O.R.

They're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer.

Don't you have a kid named Schaefer

in your service?

BOCK

(scowls, mutters)

I had a Schaefer. He died yesterday

of an overdose of insulin. What do

they want Schaefer for?

LAGERMAN

The Holding Room nurse says there

was a Dr. Schaefer hanging around

the Holding Room. It wouldn't have

been your Schaefer anyway. The nurse

says it was senior staff, a middle-

aged man.

BOCK

There's no senior staff named Schaefer

in this hospital.

LAGERMAN

I told them that. I said, I don't

know any senior staff around here

named Schaefer. They've got detectives

down there, everything. It's a whole

big investigation.

DRUMMOND

(mad as a hatter)

I am the Fool for Christ and the

Paraclete of Caborca.

BARBARA'S VOICE

(off-screen)

For heaven's sake, Dad! What the

hell's going on?

BARBARA

(annoyed)

We all thought you were at Death's

Door! What're you doing out of bed?

BARBARA

(to Bock)

What happened? Did he say anything

to you?

BOCK

(sufficiently recovered)

As a matter of fact, he said, "I am

the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete

of Caborca." And you'd better close

the door, because if he's going to

tell everyone who walks in here he's

the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete

of Caborca, they'll put us all away.

He's already killed two doctors and

one nurse.

DRUMMOND

I am the wrath of the lamb and the

angel of the bottomless pit.

BARBARA

What do you mean he killed two doctors

and a nurse?

BOCK

I mean, he's killed two doctors and

a nurse! And he just tried to kill

me! He has something against doctors.

Somehow he got hold of a thousand

units of insulin and put it in Dr.

Schaefer's intravenous solution. And

somehow he got Dr. Ives to die of a

heart attack in the middle of the

Emergency Room. And somehow he got a

dialysis nurse named Campanella to

die of anesthesia shock on an

operating table!

(opens the closet,

points to the white

doctor's uniform

hanging there)

He's been running around the hospital

wearing Dr. Schaefer's uniform. Right

now, they're looking all over the

place for this mysterious Dr.

Schaefer. I know this all sounds as

grotesque to you as it does to me,

but you can see for yourself your

father is not the helpless comatose

patient we thought he was. Don't

look at me like I'm the one who's

crazy. Ask your crazy father!

DRUMMOND

I was merely an instrument of God. I

killed no one. They all three died

by their own hands, ritual victims

of their own institutions, murdered

by irony, an eye for an eye, biblical

retribution. Schaefer was first, you

see, because he killed God. God was

admitted to this hospital last Monday

under the name of Guernsey...

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

I was instantly aware of a divine

presence.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

I was convinced this porcelain old

man was, in fact, an Angel of the

Lord...

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

...perhaps even Christ Himself.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

Our Savior was, it seems, suffering

from emphysema.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

He was relentlessly subjected to the

benefits of modern medicine. He was

misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and put

into shock by Dr. Schaefer; raced

off to Intensive Care, where the

resident compounded the blunder and

induced a coma. I can tell you with

authority that God is indeed dead.

He died last Monday under the name

of Guernsey.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

A few hours later, he appeared to me

in a revelation.

GUERNSEY

(softly)

Rise up, Drummond. You are dead, now

you are restored.

GUERNSEY

Those who killed you and those who

killed me will die in our place. You

are the Paraclete of Caborca, the

wrath of the lamb. The angel of the

bottomless pit.

GUERNSEY

In this fashion has it been revealed

to you.

GUERNSEY

(thunders out)

The age is closed! The end is at

hand! The seal is broken!

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

Well! Not quite the burning bush

perhaps but prodigal enough for me.

I was to avenge the death of God and

my own brutalization. I was to kill

Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck

and the dialysis nurse Miss

Campanella, whose negligence caused

my coma.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

I awaited a further sign from God,

which was given to me later that

evening. Dr. Schaefer, it seems, had

arranged an assignation with a girl

from the hematology lab named Sheila.

SCHAEFER

(on phone)

Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila.

Hey listen, I got us a bed for

tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.

SHEILA

Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in.

SHEILA

What's this in your pocket?

SCHAEFER

That's my insulin. Put it back.

SHEILA

What do you take insulin for?

Diabetes? I didn't know you were a

diabetic.

SCHAEFER

It ain't contagious, don't worry

about it.

BOCK

And you put Schaefer's insulin into

the I.V. jar.

DRUMMOND

Yes. And then a second nurse came

and plugged the I.V. jar into

Schaefer. God clearly intended a

measure of irony here. The hospital

was to do all the killing for me.

All I need do was arrange for the

doctors to become patients in their

own hospital. Accordingly, the next

morning, I set out for Dr. Ives. I

put on Dr. Schaefer's uniform, pinched

some digoxine from the pharmacy and

a sandbag from a utility cart, and

found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory.

I coshed him with the sandbag, gave

him a massive shot of the digoxine.

This, you see, brought on an instant

condition of cardiac arrhythmia.

When he came to, I brought him down

to the Emergency Room.

DRUMMOND

This is Dr. Ives. He's in the

Nephrology Lab. I was in there a

little while ago, and he was suddenly

taken ill, and I thought I'd better

get him over here right away.

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

He had at that time perhaps an hour

to live. Prompt treatment would have

saved his life.

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

As a staff doctor, he was seen without

preliminaries...

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

His vital signs were taken, an

electrocardiogram...

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

...which revealed occasional

ventricular premature contractions.

An intern took his history...

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

...and then he was promptly...

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

...simply... forgotten to death.

Simply mislaid...

DRUMMOND

(voice-off)

...mislaid among the broken wrists,

the chest pains, scalp lacerations,

the man whose fingers were crushed

in a taxi door, the infant with the

skin rash, the child swiped by a

car, the old lady mugged in the

subway, the derelict beaten by

sailors, the teenage suicide, the

paranoids, drunks, asthmatics, the

rapes, the septic abortions, the

overdosed addicts...

AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS

(shouting)

Not breathing! Not breathing!

INTERN

(instructing attendant

with Mitgang)

Better put him in the Holding Room.

MISS ARONOVICI

(with the seventeen-

year-old girl)

She's taking a little pulse.

DR. SPEZIO

(to triage nurse)

Get an anesthesiologist, one-five-

one-five...

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

...the fractures, infarcts,

hemorrhages, concussions, boils,

abrasions, the colonic cancers, the

cardiac arrests -- the whole wounded

madhouse of our times...

MAN'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I wonder if I could have a minute of

your time, Doctor...

DRUMMOND

I am the fool for Christ and the

Paraclete of Caborca.

NAMELESS MAN

Well, it's an honor and a privilege,

Doctor. I've been here ten minutes,

I can't seem to get anybody to help

me. I'm suffering from some sort of

amnesia. I can't remember my name.

As a matter of fact, it's pretty

screwy. I got mugged. Two hours ago,

walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty-

Seventh Street and Second Avenue,

eight o'clock in the morning, broad

daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen-

year-old girl walks up to me, shows

me a knife about a yard long and

says, "Give me your wallet." I thought

she was kidding. I mean there's

hundreds of people walking right by.

Well, she wasn't kidding. "Listen,"

I said, "all I got's about twenty

bucks." So she takes the wallet

anyway. So I said, "How about leaving

me my identification?" I mean, I had

my driver's license, my Diner's Club,

my credit cards. But she took them

all, the whole damn wallet, credit

cards, everything. So I stopped some

guy, I said, "Hey, you see that girl

there, walking away?" He says, "Yeah."

I said, "She just stole my wallet,

credit cards and everything." He

says, "Well, that's what they want,

the credit cards." So I started

looking for a cop. I mean, go find a

cop, right? Well, I finally find a

cop. The girl's halfway to South

America by now, probably bought the

ticket with my credit cards. So the

cop says, "What's your name?" And

you want to know something? I couldn't

think of my name. The girl took all

my identification, you know what I

mean? She took all my credit cards.

So I said, "You know this is screwy.

I can't think of my name." So he

took me to the station house. The

sergeant says, "What's your name?" I

said, "I don't know! She took all my

credit cards!" So they took me down

here. So what do you think, Doctor?

I'm nuts, right? I finally flipped.

MRS. CUSHING

Who's number 7-6-8-0-2-S? Is there

anybody here who is that number?

DRUMMOND

(off-screen)

In this way was it revealed to me

the manner of Nurse Campanella's

death. She was to die of the great

American plague -- vestigial identity.

DRUMMOND

So last night, I coshed Miss

Campanella with a sandbag, sedated

her with thorazine, shaved her,

prepped her, and parked her in a

corridor of the X-Ray Department for

five hours.

BOCK

Why X-Ray?

DRUMMOND

Well, at X-Ray, a sedated body lying

around unattended for five hours

wouldn't seem unusual.

BOCK

Of course.

DRUMMOND

Her operation -- that is to say,

Mrs. Mangafranni's operation -- was

not scheduled until nine-thirty. So

at nine-fifteen this morning, I rang

for my nurse...

BOCK

You rang for your nurse?

DRUMMOND

To insure one full hour of

uninterrupted privacy.

BOCK

Oh yes.

DRUMMOND

I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella

off to the operating rooms, replaced

her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni's,

exchanged charts and identity

bracelets. She died officially of

anesthesia shock. But, in point of

fact, she died because she was wearing

another woman's identity.

BARBARA

(to Bock)

God, what do we do now? Let me take

him back to Mexico. It's a simple

world there. If you turn him in,

they'll just cage him in the Rockland

State Hospital for the Criminally

Insane. Let me take him back, Herb.

BOCK

Are you kidding? We'll both take

him. I'm going with you! Get him

dressed. We're getting out of here

before the police put us all in

Rockland State.

DRUMMOND

I haven't finished my work here. I

have this Welbeck to dispose of. I

am the angel of the bottomless pit

and the wrath of the lamb.

BARBARA

Oh dear, he's having another

revelation.

BOCK

Look, that ambulance must be here by

now. You go down and get them. I'll

give him a shot of something to knock

him out. We'll take him to the airport

in the ambulance.

DRUMMOND

You're hallucinating again.

MRS. DONOVAN

...Edwards never showed up. I'm short-

staffed as hell. It's just me and

Felicia. It's like Sunday. Nobody's

here.

DR. BIEGELMAN

I'll be at lunch...

MRS. DONOVAN

Yeah, you gotta send me somebody...

Oh yeah?

MEAD

We'll be in Eight-O-Six.

MRS. DONOVAN

(chuckles into phone)

...then what did she say?

WELBECK

(to Mrs. Donovan)

I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on

this floor named Drummond, and I'd

like to see his chart.

MRS. DONOVAN

I'll call you back.

WELBECK

Oh, Dr. Bock. Can I have a few minutes

of your time, sir?

BOCK

No.

WELBECK

Dr. Gilley tells me you're the one

who initiated these proceedings

against me.

BOCK

I'm busy, Welbeck.

WELBECK

I'd like to know what you have against

me.

BOCK

You turned up half-stoned for a simple

nephrectomy eight days ago, botched

it, put the patient into failure and

damn near killed him. Then, pausing

only to send in your bill, you flew

off on the wings of man to an island

of sun in Montego Bay. This is the

third time in two years we've had to

patch up your patients; the other

two died. You're greedy, unfeeling,

inept, indifferent, self-inflating

and unconscionably profitable. Aside

from that, I have nothing against

you. I'm sure you play a hell of a

game of golf. What else do you want

to know?

WELBECK

Excuse me for a moment, Doctor.

(he reaches over the

nurses' desk for a

phone)

This is Dr. Welbeck. Were you paging

me?

(regarding Bock with

cold scorn)

How much do you make a year, Bock?

For a guy who makes a lousy forty,

fifty grand...

(on phone)

Hello, Arthur, I understand you've

been trying to reach me all morning...

WILLIAM MEAD

I'm telling you, Milton, he pulls

out all the wires and the tubes, and

he gets up and puts on a doctor's

uniform, and he goes out, and he

murders doctors! He just went out

ten seconds before you came in!

WILLIAM MEAD

And I'll tell you something else

about this crazy place you got here!

There was a naked Indian in here

last night doing a war dance! That's

the kind of crazy place you're running

here, Milton! You got to get me out

of here, Milton. This is a crazy

place, Milton!

WILLIAM MEAD

(appealing to Bock)

I wake up last night, there's a goddam

Indian in here, a naked Indian! What

kind of hospital is this?

MILTON MEAD

(on phone)

This is Mr. Mead, are you paging me?

WILLIAM MEAD

A couple of hours later I wake up

again, and the guy in that bed there

is getting out of the bed...

MILTON MEAD

(to Hitchcock)

Are the police still in the building?

HITCHCOCK

Yes.

MILTON MEAD

You'd better get them up here. Yes.

WILLIAM MEAD

All day long, he lays there like a

dead man. All of a sudden, in the

middle of the night, he gets out of

bed! I thought I was going crazy!

MILTON MEAD

(on phone)

Yes, this is Mead... Oh, dear.

When?...

WILLIAM MEAD

You know what he says to me? He says,

you're hallucinating. Listen, I just

saw a naked Indian. Now, I'm seeing

a ghost. I got to figure he's right,

I'm hallucinating, right?

MILTON MEAD

I'll be down directly.

(hangs up)

Never rains but it pours. A fire

just broke out in one of those

condemned buildings. The squatters

in the building came out. The police

tried to arrest them and, apparently,

the situation has erupted into a

riot.

(to Bock as he heads

for the door)

I'm sure you're wondering what this

is all about, Herb.

WILLIAM MEAD

You're not going to leave me alone

in this crazy place, Milton!

MILTON MEAD

(at the door with

Bock)

Mr. Hitchcock is staying with you.

(to Hitchcock)

You better call the cops, Tom.

WILLIAM MEAD

Milton! Milton! Milton!!!

MILTON MEAD

I haven't the time now, and I'm not

even going to try to tell you this

curious story my brother just told

me. I'll fill you in on it at lunch

some time.

MILTON MEAD

(rushes not to miss

the elevator)

Hold it!

BARBARA

The ambulance is here.

BOCK

Yeah, but your father isn't. He's

disappeared. He put on Schaefer's

uniform and has gone out to do God's

work, presumably the murder of Dr.

Welbeck. Except, that fellow on the

phone over there is Dr. Welbeck.

WELBECK

(in background on

phone)

Oh my God, Arthur! What are you

talking about? Have you talked to

Dr. Hogan about this?

BOCK

And, on top of everything else, the

other patient in your father's room

overheard his whole confession and

just told the Chief Administrator of

the hospital. They're sending for

the cops.

WELBECK

(almost apoplectic on

phone)

Oh, my God, Arthur. Well, who held

title? Do the underwriters know about

this yet?... Oh my God! Arthur,

what're you waiting for? Arrest the

son of a bitch! Turn him in!... Oh

my God! When?... Of course, Arthur,

call me right back. I'm at the Holly

Pavilion, Eighth Floor. Please! Right

away!

BOCK

Are you all right, Welbeck?

WELBECK

All right?! That son of a bitch is

trying to wipe me out! My partner,

the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr.

Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief.

And he's trying to wipe me out!

MRS. DONOVAN

(extending a chart)

Mr. Drummond's chart, Doctor.

WELBECK

(angrily seizes the

chart)

What room is it?

MRS. DONOVAN

Eight-O-Six.

WELBECK

I'm expecting a phone call. Put it

straight through to me in that room.

WELBECK

The son of a bitch has been draining

the company with phony purchase orders

on another company, of which, it now

turns out, his wife is the principal

stockholder! Transparent fraud! I'll

send him up for twenty years!

WELBECK

Well, Drummond, you don't seem that

much the worse for the wear.

WELBECK

(to Hitchcock)

Would you mind using some other phone?

I'm expecting an important call.

WILLIAM MEAD

What is this? Who... who is this

guy?

HITCHCOCK

(on phone)

Yes, well, I'll be at the Nurses'

Desk, Sergeant. It would be futile

for me to try to explain this to you

over the phone.

WELBECK

(leafing through

Drummond's chart)

You've got a bit of fever, Drummond,

but you're coming along very well.

WILLIAM MEAD

I'm not Drummond, you monkey!

Drummond's the other bed!

WELBECK

That's mine.

(on phone)

It's Welbeck here... Yes, Arthur, go

ahead...

WILLIAM MEAD

I'm getting out of this nuthouse!

BOCK

(pushing him gently

back)

All right, take it easy, Mr. Mead.

WILLIAM MEAD

I came in here just to get a lousy

polyp cut out.

WELBECK

(on phone)

Oh, my God, what do you mean? How

many transactions were there? Bu...

but Arthur, I... I borrowed against

that stock! I'm in the hole for over

three hundred thousand!...

WILLIAM MEAD

(appealing to the

gods)

I'm a sick man! I'm supposed to have

peace and quiet!

WELBECK

(on phone and

apoplectic)

What do you mean, Brazil?! I just

spoke to Hogan's office yesterday,

and they just told me...

WELBECK

I'm wiped out. The S.E.C. has

suspended trading in my stock!

BOCK

(on phone)

Cardiac arrest, Holly Eight.

BARBARA

We have an emergency here.

BOCK

(rips off Welbeck's

natty jacket)

Breathe him.

P.A. SYSTEM

(off-screen)

C.A.C. Holly Eight. Please clear all

corridors.

MRS. DONOVAN

Where's Biegelman?

CHANDLER

He went to lunch.

MRS. DONOVAN

Natch. Get that other bed out of

here.

BARBARA

(to Nurse Chile as

others begin moving

William Mead's bed

out of the room)

Give him an ambu bag and an airway.

VOICE

(off-screen)

What's been happening?

CHANDLER

(to Seventh Floor

Nursing Supervisor

just outside door)

Watch it...

P.A. SYSTEM

(off-screen)

C.A.C. Holly Eight. Please clear all

corridors.

DR. MORSE

In here?

MRS. DONOVAN

Yeah.

HITCHCOCK

(to Intern Chandler)

Who is it?

P.A. SYSTEM

(off-screen)

Dr. Robert Jackson.

CHANDLER

One of the patients had a cardiac

arrest.

DR. MORSE

What do you have, Dr. Bock?

BOCK

Total cardiac arrest.

P.A. SYSTEM

(off-screen)

Dr. Rigby. Dr. Rigby. Dr. Lilac.

DR. MORSE

How long has he been like this?

BOCK

About a minute. No pulse, no

heartbeat, no respiration...

DR. LOOMIS

All right, I'll take over.

BOCK

Endotrachial tube.

DONOVAN

(rushing in background

with others)

I'm sorry, Doctor, but we have another

emergency in 823.

CHANDLER

Endotrachial tube.

DR. LOOMIS

Shall we get him up on the cart?

DR. MORSE

Yeah.

DR. MORSE

All right, who is this patient? What's

the story on this patient?

DR. MORSE

Is this his chart, Dr. Bock?

DR. MORSE

What's his name? Drummond?

BOCK

Yes, his name's Drummond. That's his

chart.

DR. MORSE

(studying the chart)

Oh Christ, the poor son of a bitch

just had a nephrectomy a week ago.

HITCHCOCK

Was it Drummond?

MRS. DONOVAN

Who else would it be?

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

Pick him up. Put him on it. Stop the

massage.

DR. MORSE

Ventricular fibrillation. Get me the

paddles. Push another amp of bicarb.

DR. MORSE

Set it for two hundred.

NURSE

(off-screen)

That's two hundred.

DR. MORSE

Everybody bock away.

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

One-two-three...

DR. MORSE

(in background)

Did he convert?

DR. LOOMIS

(in background)

No, he's still fibrillating.

DR. MORSE

(in background)

Let's go to four hundred.

BARBARA

(sotto voce to Bock)

What do we do now?

NURSING SUPERVISOR

(off-screen)

It's four hundred.

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

Everybody back One-two-three...

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

That didn't work either.

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

All right. Let me have a c.c. of

Adrenaline and intercardiac needle.

DR. MORSE

(off-screen)

Stop the massage. Ventricular

fibrillation. Put another amp of

bicarb. Two hundred.

DRUMMOND

(barely audible above

the traffic rumbling

heedlessly around

him)

Let those who are in Judea flee to

the mountains, for the age is closed,

the season of the seventh seal is at

hand!

DR. MORSE

Hang isopril, two in five hundred.

Let's take one more crack with the

paddles. Everybody back off the cart.

HITCHCOCK

Is he dead?

BOCK

They can't get him out of fib. I

don't think he'll make it.

HITCHCOCK

Thank God.

(sighs, turns to the

two detectives)

This should close the case, Sergeant.

LEADER

Everybody take it easy! Nobody's

going to be hurt! We just want the

Director!

SHOUTING CROWD

We want Sundstrom! We want Sundstrom!

Community control! Community control!

Hip-hip-Hippocrates! Up with service!

Down with fees!

SUNDSTROM

You people want to see me?

FIRST MILITANT

Yeah, baby, we want to see you...

SECOND MILITANT

We're taking over this hospital,

man...

SUNDSTROM

I've had it up to here. I'm not

dealing with this kind of cheap

blackmail!

LEADER

Now look, man. Now wait a minute

there!

FIRST MILITANT

We're looking for a hostage!

LEADER

Fourteen people just got arrested

for doing...

MAN

Lookit, man, where's the TV camera?

LEADER

Would you be cool, man?

(now yelling)

Fourteen people got arrested for

doing nothing but living in their

homes, which you people threw them

out of.

CROWD

Right on!

LEADER

So now we're going to arrest you.

We're going to hold you hostage and

we ain't letting you go un...

AMBLER

We, the members of the Doctors

Liberation Committee indict this

hospital for the criminal neglect of

the community in which it is situated!

We demand an immediate dissolution

of the governing and executive boards.

SHOUT

What are you going to do about those

fourteen ghetto people?

SUNDSTROM

I am not going to do anything...

about anything.

SHOUT

Yes, you are!

SUNDSTROM

By God, if you want to take over

this hospital, you take it over!

SHOUTS

We will! Right on!

SUNDSTROM

You run it! I am finished! I quit!

You run it! You pay the bills! You

fight the city!

MILITANT

We will!

SUNDSTROM

You fight the state! You fight the

unions. You fight the community!

You... you think you can do a better

job, you do it! Now I am finished! I

quit! It's all yours!

CROWD

Quit! Quit!

SHOUTS OF COPS

All right, come on... come on --

Let's clear the area. -- Come on,

let's clear this place... Keep cool.

Everybody keep cool.

DRUMMOND

Let those who are in Judea flee to

the mountains, for the age is closed,

the season of the seventh seal is at

of the seventh se...

BOCK

Dr. Welbeck is dead. They thought he

was you.

DRUMMOND

Yes, I know. We must arrange to have

his body shipped to my Apache village

where we will bury him with full

tribal rites. In a day or two,

somebody'll ask, "Whatever happened

to Dr. Welbeck?" And it will be

assumed he absconded to Brazil to

join his partner, the eminent

orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan.

Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked,

forgotten to death, you see.

BARBARA

(taking her father

around to the back)

We have to hurry, Dad.

BOCK

I'm not going.

(he moves to the

ambulance, closes

the door)

The hospital's coming apart. I can't

walk out on it when it's coming apart.

Somebody has to be responsible,

Barbara. Everybody's hitting the

road, running to the hills, running

away. Somebody's got to be

responsible.

(across Barbara to

the driver)

Kennedy Airport. You've got a two-

thirty flight to make.

BOCK

You going back in?

SUNDSTROM

Yeah.

SUNDSTROM

(matter-of-factly)

It's like pissing in the wind, right,

Herb?

BOCK

Right.

FADE OUT.
