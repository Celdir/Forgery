ROOKIE COP

Cooool.

ARTHUR

Evening, Constable!

OLDER COP 1

(seen it all before)

Hi, Arthur.

ARTHUR

Are you familiar with the

expression `I can explain

everything'?

OLDER COP 1

Out of the car, please.

2.

ARTHUR

Terribly sorry, but in the film

they used a different model to show

the old Batchap getting in and out.

This one has no doors, so I'd have

to squeeze out the back arsehole

first. Which nobody wants...

(TO COP 2)

Apart from you, cheeky monkey!

(BEAT)

It's a joke! Okay, okay.

OLDER COP 1

Okay, explain everything.

ARTHUR

Well. What with having spunked 1.6

million fat Alberts on this little

runaround, I thought why not take

it a step further and try to

actually collar a few ne-er do

wells? It worked for the

billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not

the future billionaire Arthur Bach-

Templemead? Will I have to do

traffic school?

OLDER COP 2

How much have you drunk, Arthur?

ARTHUR

To use the technical medical term -

megabloodyshitloads. Either that or

I've had a stroke! But fret not, I

have a designated driver.

HOMELESS ROBIN

Where's my five thousand dollars?

ARTHUR

The Boy Homeless here neglected to

say he'd never driven.

(MORE)

3.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Or that the only reason he's sober

is to be ready for the conspiracy

of leopards about to seize

Manhattan.

HOMELESS ROBIN

It's LIZARDS! English prick!

ARTHUR

I trust this will cover all repairs

to New York and any inconvenience

to your good selves?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the

other chap.

JAY

Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!

ARTHUR

Goodness. Why?

JAY

Said I cut the bombita with pig

killer!

ARTHUR

Rude man. And who threw hot

Americano in whose face again?

JAY

I did in his. No half and half

neither. That shit burnt!

4.

GARY

I burnt my sister's hair.

JAY

(high fiving him)

Cool...

GARY

Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause

I don't fit her definition of

hygiene. Plenty of places to take a

shit, toilet's just one of them.

Just ask the a-rabs.

ARTHUR

It's like a chat show, this.

(looking into an imaginary

CAMERA)

It's been said of my next guest, by

Jay the bandaged lunatic, that

she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out,

whacked-up asswipe'.

(to a PROSTITUTE)

Carmella, when did you first dream

of becoming a crack whore?

PROSTITUTE

Mother died when I was six.

ARTHUR

Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.

PROSTITUTE

My father raped me when I was

twelve.

ARTHUR

Sounds like you had six relatively

good years.

JAY

What do you do?

ARTHUR

I model riding boots, I spend

money, I sleep with women. But I

have weekends off and I am my own

boss.

OLDER COP 1

Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-

d-lawyer's here.

5.

ARTHUR

(STANDING)

I never thought New York's

underbelly could be quite such

agreeable company. I shall never

forget you. Farewell.

DEVERE

I don't think your mother will be

pleased, Arthur.

ARTHUR

Really, Elverton - if a chap can't

help out a few chums, whatever

their station in life.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Each has given his or her word to

put the criminal life behind them.

ARTHUR

I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep

easy tonight.

JAY

(points at A CAMERAMAN)

Don't point that shit at me, bitch!

I will FUCK YOU UP!

HOMELESS ROBIN

Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!

PRESS

Arthur! What will your mother say?

Didn't she send you here to get you

out of the British papers? Arthur!

6.

ARTHUR

Anyone need a job? My last driver

resigned after I filled his limo

with squirrels. Preferably sober,

clean driving licence?

TITLES

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Anyone know a good bar?

JUMP CUT TO:

ARTHUR

Stand back!

7.

CARMELLA

(LAUGHING)

Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the

recession?

ARTHUR

The what?

ARTHUR

Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix

this thing right now.

(to his first customer)

How much, sir?

FIRST MAN

Um. $800 please.

ARTHUR

Coming right up.

(keys it in)

Fries with that?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Congratulations everyone! THE

RECESSION'S OVER!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can

you squeeze me in for a little

snack? Yeah, just me and a couple

of mates.

8.

ARTHUR

Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie

gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a

motherlode of chips and your entire

wine cellar please.

ERICA

Arthur?

ARTHUR

(TAKEN ABACK)

Erica? Fancy meeting you here!

Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the

very best friend forever of my

girlfriend Susan. And Erica's

parents Ernest and Margaret.

(to Erica and her parents)

Are you familiar with the

expression `I can't explain

anything'?

ERICA

Who are the women with you, Arthur?

ARTHUR

Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe

she works for Avis. Checks the cars

for dings, dead people in the

trunk, that sort of thing. And

this is Carmella. Anyway...

ERICA'S FATHER

What do you do, Carmella?

CARMELLA

Whatever you want. But no

penetration without a rubber.

ARTHUR

Carmella's joking. She's actually

a...queen. Of a very small country.

ERICA'S FATHER

Is she now?

ARTHUR

It's terribly small.

9.

ERICA'S FATHER

I see.

ARTHUR

Rhode Island could beat the crap

out of it in a war.

ERICA'S FATHER

Yes, it's a small place.

ARTHUR

85 cents in a cab from one end of

the country to the other. I'm

talking small.

ERICA'S FATHER

I think I understand how small it

is.

ARTHUR

Just had the entire country

carpeted, this is not a big place.

ERICA'S FATHER

You need to grow up, Arthur.

ARTHUR

That's easy for you to say, you

haven't got 50 pairs of short

trousers hanging in your closet.

Maybe we should go somewhere else.

ERICA

Maybe you should.

ARTHUR

Could I have all those lobsters to

go, please?

10.

GIRL (O.S.)

(PANTING)

More British!

ARTHUR

Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot

Rosy Lee right up your fanny?

11.

ARTHUR

Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation

mad cow disease Yorkshire pudding

bad teeth rain rain rain rain!

ARTHUR

(brightly, as he humps)

Morning, Hobson!

HOBSON

Morning, Arthur.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus

package failed to reignite the

economy.

(reading a receipt)

De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?

ARTHUR

Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.

HOBSON

The African heritage festival

celebrated five months from now?

12.

ARTHUR

(noticing Sofia's stopped

having sex with him)

Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.

How impolite of me. Sofia, this is

Hobson, my nanny.

SOFIA

Nanny?

HOBSON

He's merely shaped like an adult.

SOFIA

Is she going to stay here?

ARTHUR

Hobson, could you come back in a

minute and a half please?

HOBSON

Negative. You're seeing your mother

this morning.

ARTHUR

Nobody told me.

HOBSON

Actually I did, on the other side

of the vast moat of champagne known

as `last night'.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

I wouldn't recommend letting him

get used to your breasts, dear.

Addictive personality. He was at

mine until he was six.

ARTHUR

Hobson! Really...

HOBSON

I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the

nipples to see him off...

SOFIA

I can't do this.

13.

HOBSON

I support your decision 100%. Will

you be requiring a taxi, or just be

getting in a random passing car?

HOBSON (CONT'D)

Say goodbye to your new friends,

Arthur. They have to go back to the

recession now.

ARTHUR

Cancel my mother please, Hobson.

I'll work from bed today.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Not the death metal, please!

HOBSON

(shouting over the music)

Aren't you a fan of Carcass?

HOBSON (CONT'D)

`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a

classic of its genre.

ARTHUR

OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP!

HOBSON

Good boy.

ARTHUR

I'm going for a shower.

HOBSON

I'll alert the media.

14.

ARTHUR

(SINGING)

To Bombay, a travelling circus

came...

HOBSON

They brought an intelligent

elephant and Nellie was her

name...Hobson!

ARTHUR

Female Tom Hanks!

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Heading east towards Park Avenue.

HOBSON

She's early today...

ARTHUR

Can we invite her up and dress her

as Forrest Gump?

HOBSON

No.

ARTHUR

Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.

HOBSON

Do your armpits.

(INTO PHONE)

(MORE)

15.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

Mr. Miller? My employer

inexplicably agreed to purchase

your...

(READS SCREEN)

`Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care

Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping

costs? Sorry, but that transaction

will take place over my dead body,

and I'm feeling rather well today.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Hobson! That was your birthday

present! You like bears!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Father Wolverine...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Wank Williams...That man has the

constitution of an ox.

HOBSON

That reminds me, clean your

genitals. Heaven knows what

wildlife that girl was harbouring

between her thighs.

ARTHUR

I give you `Sideways farting

spider'.

HOBSON

Arthur, you have to stop giving

money away!

16.

ARTHUR

I'm a philanthropist.

HOBSON

With the emphasis on the `pissed'.

Really, what is it about unearned

wealth that brings out such idiocy

in those who have it and those who

want it? The way you're going,

you'll have spent your inheritance

before you've inherited it.

ARTHUR

(shifts to new pose)

`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'

HOBSON

Why did you fire Jessica?

ARTHUR

What kind of yoga teacher won't let

a pupil invent positions? She was

a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.

(CHANGING POSE)

`Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.

HOBSON

Interesting. It looks more like

`Rich twit hiding from mother.' May

I remind you, she finances your

preposterous existence...

ARTHUR

I know, I know. Never bite the hand

that fists me.

MARTY

Sorry, fellas.

HOBSON

(CONSPIRATORIAL)

You don't seriously intend to keep

employing this gentleman?

17.

ARTHUR

Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He

got laid off in Chicago...

HOBSON

But he doesn't know his way around

New York!

ARTHUR

So? I want interesting, fun people

around me, not drones who just get

the job done...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Marty! Stop the car!

WOMAN (O.S.)

The Chrysler Building. Designed by

William Van Allen...

NAOMI

...and inspired by the machine age

of the 1920s, this magnificent

structure was the world's tallest

building for 11 months before the

Empire State stole its thunder.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

The Chrysler got its name when the

builder went bust in the 1928

Cement Famine and had to melt down

his Chrysler to make the pointy bit

at the top. If you peer closely you

can still make out remnants of a

hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk

twice if you voted Hoover.'

18.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

That was a joke, folks. It was

built for the Chrysler corporation.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

The spire is a beauty, especially

on a winter's morning when the sun

hits it and it just seems to...

GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST

(INTERRUPTING)

How tall is it?

NAOMI

1047 feet madam, not allowing for

pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.

ARTHUR

Can I join your tour please?

NAOMI

Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the

free authentic street pretzel.

Sorry, my bosses make the prices.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Sorry. I can't take cards.

(BEAT)

Ah, owe me it. I start on that

corner every day on the hour...

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't

your braille windshield work?

CABBIE

(ANGRY)

!NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS!

19.

NAOMI

PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED

PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA

ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN

MARTILLO!

ARTHUR

Wow. What did you say?

NAOMI

Just generalised criticism of his

parents and genitals.

(to the tourists)

Everyone make it over alive?

Excellent. Next we enter Times

Square, world famous for New Year's

Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball

descends at eye-poppingly slow

speed for the inexplicable

entertainment of a million drunk

fools. Many people think the square

is actually a square, despite

blatant evidence otherwise.

(TO ARTHUR)

Sir? What shape is Times Square?

ARTHUR

A circle?

NAOMI

(LAUGHS)

See? Morons.

GRUMPY MALE TOURIST

When do we get the pretzel?

NAOMI

Soon, sir. Soon.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Okay, next the very Laundromat once

used by George Gershwin, Donald

Trump...

20.

NAOMI

...Mr Big from Sex and the City and

three of the 9-11 terrorists.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Oh, dad.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank

himself to death at the Chelsea

Hotel half an hour after losing a

sock in this very dryer.

ARTHUR

(CONSPIRATORIAL)

Are you abusing this tour to do

your errands?

NAOMI

Are you abusing the tour to stalk

me?

ARTHUR

Absolutely.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

These things are amazing. Have you

ever put all your father's clothes

on and just got inside one?

HOBSON

Where the blazes is that boy?

Arthur!

21.

NAOMI

Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's

crown, the Empire State Building.

This iconic symbol of American

corporate might was adapted during

World War 2 in case of attack from

enemy forces. At three minutes'

notice the entire structure can

retract into the ground like a

tortoise's head.

TOURIST

That's not possible. I should know,

I'm a civil engineer.

NAOMI

You're not being very civil to me.

ARTHUR

The building doesn't retract; the

ground rises up.

NAOMI

Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank

you, sir.

ARTHUR

They were going to install giant

legs so if a plane was flying at

the tower it could run away. But

where's it going to run?

NAOMI

Manhattan's in the way.

ARTHUR

It'd have to jump in the Hudson.

NAOMI

Victory to the Nazis. Is that what

you want?

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.

22.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Do I know you from somewhere?

ARTHUR

If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.

NAOMI

What are they?

ARTHUR

The gossip websites.

NAOMI

That the internet? Ah, my

computer's too old for all that.

ARTHUR

For the internet? Seriously?

NAOMI

Life's too short for all this

obsessive upgrading.

ARTHUR

You consider the internet an

upgrade? Wow.

NAOMI

So why do people gossip about you?

ARTHUR

Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.

HOBSON

You're late for your mother!

NAOMI

(TO ARTHUR)

Sorry, this pretzel stand is a

watering hole for the crazies.

(raises her voice to

HOBSON)

The soup kitchen's just up and to

the left, honey.

ARTHUR

Hobson, this is...

(reads her badge)

Naomi.

NAOMI

She's with you?

23.

HOBSON

Delighted to meet you, Naomi.

Normally one has to go to a bowling

alley to meet a woman of your

stature.

NAOMI

Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.

HOBSON

You aren't the first woman who

walks the streets this young man

has asked.

NAOMI

Who's this? Joan Rivers' older

bitterer sister?

ARTHUR

My nanny.

NAOMI

Obviously. Seriously, who is she?

ARTHUR

My nanny. Well, she started as

that, but these days she's more of

an all-round enforcer and

bodyguard.

NAOMI

Sorry, I have to get out the cattle

prod and haul ass. Got another tour

starting in eight minutes.

ARTHUR

Can I call you?

NAOMI

I don't give my number to grown men

with nannies. But as you may not be

a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.

24.

ARTHUR

But what if this is the one?

HOBSON

This is just like the Komodo

dragon. Everyone else is happy to

see one in the zoo and leave it

there. You had to own one. Thank

goodness that handbag manufacturer

was prepared to take the poor

lizard away.

ARTHUR

(HORRIFIED)

You said he's in London Zoo!

HOBSON

He is, Arthur. Are you the only one

allowed to joke now?

ARTHUR

I don't like it here.

HOBSON

Of course you don't. People work

here.

GRANT

(HATES ARTHUR)

Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead.

ARTHUR

Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your

parents are you most like?

Abercrombie or Fitch?

GRANT

(doesn't get the joke)

I have no connection with that

store. My family name is Von

Krausehoff. Take a seat please.

25.

GRANT (CONT'D)

Vivienne?

(conspiratorial, flirty)

White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.

HOBSON

Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take

long. Then we'll have ice cream.

VIVIENNE (O.S.)

Come in, Arthur.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

Arthur.

ARTHUR

Vivienne.

VIVIENNE

You know I prefer `mother'.

ARTHUR

I'm sorry. You look more like a

Vivienne.

VIVIENNE

(not looking up)

So. How are you, Arthur?

ARTHUR

Quite busy. I have a riding boot

shoot for Petrie Dressage...

26.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What else...I'm meeting Ivanka

Trump for brunch to discuss the

environment. She's sending her

helicopter to avoid the traffic...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Crashed my Batmobile into the

bronze bull on Wall Street...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

...which caused a hole to swallow

up the New York Stock Exchange...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

..the world economy to collapse and

the planet to descend into looting

and cannibalism.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What else? Um...tripped over in the

shower this morning. Head split

open, found a family of meerkats

hiding in there! Hated the thought

of the little lads being homeless

so I bricked up the remaining half

of my brain, popped them back in

and Hobson glued my skull back

together.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I'm thinking of buying a giant. I

think the market's right for it.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

You really are a shoddy mother.

27.

VIVIENNE

Did I hear you say you were meeting

Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's

nice. Right. Today we're going to

have a friendly chat. Then a

serious talk. And lastly make a

timetable. How does all that sound?

ARTHUR

Amazing. Do you have any vodka?

VIVIENNE

What happened, Arthur? You were

such a sweet baby.

ARTHUR

I still wake up in my own poo

occasionally.

VIVIENNE

Right, that's it for the chat. Time

to transition to our talk.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

This insanity has to end, Arthur.

As the delightful coffee-coloured

gentleman who runs this country

said, `The time has come to set

aside childish things.'

ARTHUR

Can't Hobson set them aside for me?

VIVIENNE

Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet

are on the ground, she's of fine

stock...

ARTHUR

(GETS UP)

Oh. That's what this is all about.

I'm not marrying Susan. I don't

love her.

VIVIENNE

And? You think I spent my marriage

to your father skipping through

meadows?

28.

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

(GETTING EXASPERATED)

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

29.

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

(heading to the door)

VIVIENNE

ARTHUR

VIVIENNE

30.

ARTHUR

That I won't follow in his

footsteps and marry a woman I hate?

I think he might climb out of the

grave and dance on it.

VIVIENNE

Suit yourself.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

My will, which I have updated to

designate Grant in reception as the

sole beneficiary.

ARTHUR

You wouldn't! You're my...

VIVIENNE

...Vivienne? Try me.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

Shall we segue to the timetable

part of our meeting?

HOBSON

Ah. The ring your father gave your

mother, I recall.

ARTHUR

(feeling its huge weight)

Did he knock her out with it, then

drive her to the church in the

trunk of his Bentley?

HOBSON

No. Your father was a gentleman.

ARTHUR

What's gentlemanly about dying

before I knew him? That's just

rude. Did he ever love my mother?

31.

HOBSON

They had their days.

ARTHUR

Ah well. At least he doesn't have

to wake up every day to a woman

with a face like saran wrap

stretched over a gargoyle.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What about Naomi?

HOBSON

Arthur. I say this with love:

ARTHUR

Uh-oh...

HOBSON

Even by modern male standards

you're a breathtakingly immature

little shit. Coupled with the kind

of money you have access to, that's

deadly. Susan may not have a four

hour stand up routine about the

Flatiron Building, but she's a

solid girl who will look after you.

ARTHUR

I have you for that.

HOBSON

Not forever.

ARTHUR

Yes forever. You're Hobson.

NAOMI

Hello?

(SILENCE)

Hello?

32.

ARTHUR (O.S, ON PHONE)

(MOCK SINISTER)

This is your English stalker.

NAOMI

(UNFAZED)

Oh, hi! What's up?

ARTHUR

I'm sorry, I've never really

understood that question. Are you

free tomorrow night?

NAOMI

Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht.

ARTHUR

Is that a euphemism for something

naughty?

NAOMI

No, it's a lie. I have a creative

writing class. Tonight?

ARTHUR

I have a contractual commitment.

Friday?

NAOMI

You got it.

ARTHUR

Paper.

NAOMI

Sorry?

ARTHUR

Sorry, I was talking to something

else. So. What do you want to do?

33.

NAOMI

A movie?

ARTHUR

Movie? Come on, you've got to try

harder than that.

NAOMI

Pizza.

ARTHUR

What have you always wanted to do?

NAOMI

It's a first date, Arthur. Not our

honeymoon.

ARTHUR

Every date will be our honeymoon.

NAOMI

(MOCK DISGUSTED)

Ewww. Okay, uh, picnic in the

park...or dinner with a view. I

like views.

ARTHUR

What sort of food do you like?

NAOMI

Anything but guts and mushrooms.

Okay, enough questions.

ARTHUR

Oh come on. This all helps build up

a profile of you before I trick you

into my basement. I'd hate to not

have your favourite snacks ready.

NAOMI

Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?

Just that I....

34.

HOBSON

Time to get engaged, Arthur. The

Komodo dragon can wait.

ARTHUR

Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?

BUTLER

No, sir. It's 8.34.

ARTHUR

FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can

be a real cunt sometimes, don't you

think? I'll be right back. See you

in an hour and a half ago...

BUTLER

Would you care for anything while

you wait?

ARTHUR

A trampoline and a selection of

woodland creatures if that's not

too much trouble.

35.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Ah!

(TO JESUS)

Shhhhh...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Bollocks.

(TO JESUS)

Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,

um....you know...

(points to the water)

...turn this into a nice 1990

Romanee Conti, could you?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Cheers ears.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

`Genuine Sword of the First

Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Jesus Fucking Christ!

(TO JESUS)

Sorry. It's not like you shouted

`Arthur Fucking Bach' when they

pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Feel the force, Luke.

BURT

Arthur!

36.

ARTHUR

I, er, had a bit of food stuck in

my teeth and couldn't find a

toothpick.

BURT

Heck, this sword went through three

crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.

Nothing you can do to harm it.

ARTHUR

You don't, um, have anything

stronger, do you?

BURT

Sparkling.

BURT (CONT'D)

`The drunkard and the glutton shalt

come to poverty: and drowsiness

shalt clothe a man with rags.'

ARTHUR

Surely a glass of sherry at

Christmas?

BURT

Peace be with you.

ARTHUR

And also with me.

BURT

Arthur. Can I be honest with you?

ARTHUR

You're the real Slim Shady? I knew

it!

37.

BURT

My faith teaches me to hate the

sin, not the sinner. But with you,

I struggle with that belief.

ARTHUR

You could switch to Judaism.

(glances up at the fan)

Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I

put the fan on?

BURT

Anyway, Arthur. However I feel

about you, my daughter loves you.

ARTHUR

Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Let's knock our heads together and

find a way to stop her loving

me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on

the sex offenders register....No, I

am and she knows.

(BEAT)

Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!

I did once dabble actually, so I

can tell a plausible story.

BURT

You made love to a guy?

ARTHUR

One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,

Burt.

BURT

You made love to a Moslem?

38.

ARTHUR

No, sir, it was Prince Alois of

Lichtenstein and he made love to

me. The fact that it took three

bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi

full of Krug to loosen me up

confirmed my heterosexuality.

BURT

`If there is a man who lies with a

male, they shall surely be put to

death.'

ARTHUR

Crikey. Couldn't there just be some

kind of on-the-spot fine?

BURT

You will stop this talk and marry -

my - fucking...

ARTHUR

Oh bollocks.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

It's a miracle! He is risen!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hi Susan. Erica.

SUSAN

Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I

was talking to your mother. I hear

you have something to ask me!

39.

ARTHUR

Shall we go?

WAITER (O.S.)

...the chef has bathed the bass in

a parceline of Chilean fennel and

finished him with a little gift of

kobe beef. Also I have a

progressive tasting of Kumamoto

oysters en gelee which evolve on

the palate, from light and

refreshing to complex and spicy. A

short story with a twist at the

end! Le fin.

ARTHUR

Do you have something with less

words please? The chef doesn't have

to re-cook it, just scrape off the

nouns and trim out all that

gibberish in the middle.

SUSAN

He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do

the skate in wood ear mushroom.

WAITER

Excellent decision. Sir?

ARTHUR

A bowl of champagne and a spoon.

SUSAN

Arthur, did you really have to be

so icky to Dominic?

ARTHUR

I'm sorry. I just can't handle the

whole specials act. It's not a

Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some

heated up dead things that aren't

on the main menu.

40.

SUSAN

You know, I was grumbling to your

mother about how things are with us

sometimes. How I'm sure you're

trying to drive me away...

ARTHUR

Um hm.

SUSAN

But she was explaining that

relationships are like property

purchases; invest only in high-end

stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-

coming', then hold onto the

property through thick and thin to

deliver maximum return! Isn't that

darling?

ARTHUR

Is it possible to buy the house but

then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm

not suggesting pimping you.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Look. You after our first child is

born.

SUSAN

Arthur. Why can't you learn to

laugh at genuinely amusing things?

ARTHUR

Such as?

SUSAN

YouTube clips of babies giggling.

Dane Cook.

ARTHUR

Susan. Why are we together?

SUSAN

I love you, Arthur. And you love

me, whatever you think.

41.

ARTHUR

We don't have the same sense of

humour. We don't like the same

films, food, music. You like

horses, I think they're arrogant

idiots...

SUSAN

Don't they say opposites attract?

ARTHUR

That depends on the opposites.

Racists and the Nation of Islam

don't secretly want to 69 each

other. Susan, you're beautiful.

You're bright. You're fucking

loaded. Is there really no one else

who could make you happy?

SUSAN

No.

ARTHUR

Never?

SUSAN

Well, I had a thing at college.

That was serious for a while. But

daddy...

ARTHUR

Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it

not to work out, then shot the

bloke behind a meat truck? Because

Jesus would consider that cheating.

SUSAN

Ask me, Arthur.

ARTHUR

Susan. You're the only woman...at

this table.

42.

SUSAN

You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody

who drinks like you can be happy.

ARTHUR

How do you know? What if the

drunker I get the better it is for

me? Not everyone who drinks is a

poet, Susan. Some of us drink

because we're not poets.

SUSAN

A real woman could stop you from

drinking.

ARTHUR

It'd have to be a real big woman.

SUSAN

Ask me, Arthur.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

All done.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Susan. Would you marry me? Take the

weekend if you want...

SUSAN

Yes, I'll marry you.

WAITER

Ladies and gentleman - the happy

couple!

43.

SUSAN

Erica will be the planner.

ARTHUR

Erica? She hates me.

SUSAN

Who I love, she loves.

ARTHUR

Oh, come on. She always looks like

she wants to set fire to my face

then put it out with an Uzi.

SUSAN

(ANSWERING)

Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang

on, I have Erica calling...

ARTHUR

What's going on? I only just bloody

proposed!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What have I done, Kitt? This

mistake's up there with Hitler

joining his school debating team...

VOICE (FEMALE)

Go to bed, Arthur.

HOBSON

And stop this self-pitying bibble.

You're going to be fabulously rich.

ARTHUR

Maybe I'd rather be fabulously

poor. Some poor people I see look

happy.

44.

HOBSON

That's either because they're far

away or you've just given them

money. Arthur, poor people have to

work. They stand for hours in the

rain, waiting for buses full of

other poor people to take them to

things called `jobs' which they do

all year round to pay for holidays

away from those jobs.

ARTHUR

Don't patronise me. I have a job.

HOBSON

Lying drunk on a bale of hay in

riding boots being photographed by

another pampered prick won't

prepare you for the work I mean.

And I don't want to see you suffer.

Take your fish oil.

RALPH

When are we getting cable?

NAOMI (O.S.)

We have satellite.

RALPH

Honey, that's some bullshit aerial

from the 99 cent Store!

NAOMI

It's a satellite dish!

RALPH

I read the box! It said `No

satellite fees to pay because does

not receive satellite signals!'

That's like saying `Hey - eat this

plate of broken glass! It won't

make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'

45.

NAOMI

It's better than nothing.

RALPH

No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but

you're even cheaper than your mom.

And she bought food from yard

sales.

NAOMI

I miss her too, daddy. But now

she's gone and if I'm going to keep

you in grits and Oprah the rest of

your life, you live by my rules.

RALPH

But you live like you're preparing

for a war. And you earn a decent

salary.

NAOMI

So? I want to know I can look after

you.

RALPH

What's he do, this English bum?

NAOMI

Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.

RALPH

Yeah and I bet that girl said the

same about her date. Honey, stay

home. I don't want you ending up

like that poor girl.

NAOMI

A bad actress holding her breath?

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Stop watching CSI.

46.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Sorry we drove around so long.

Navigation isn't my driver's strong

point.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Or road awareness.

ARTHUR

Can you put this on please?

NAOMI

On a first date? Are you crazy?

ARTHUR

Trust me.

NAOMI

Arthur. We're in Battery Park at

night. I've met you once - in the

company of your nanny. You make a

disturbing number of jokes about

stalking and basements. My dad

already has you down as a mass

murderer. And you want me to put on

a blindfold?

ARTHUR

I give you my word - if I kill and

eat you, you'll never see me again.

NAOMI

Okay, I'm officially a little

worried.

47.

ARTHUR

(LAUGHING)

Don't worry!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

You said you wanted a picnic.

NAOMI

Arthur, I don't know what to say.

It's beautiful.

(LOOKING AROUND)

Who did all this?

ARTHUR

The picnic fairies. Who liaised

with the flower fairies, the candle

fairies, the log fire fairies, the

hidden sound system fairies...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

...and the pizza fairies.

NAOMI

Did you take account of the heroin

fairies who hang here at night?

ARTHUR

It's nice to keep it simple like

this. I'm sick of Michelin-star

restaurants. All that embarrassing

crap with the specials.

NAOMI

Are you kidding? Where I normally

eat, the special's the one that

comes with a free toy.

48.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

You're rich rich, aren't you?

ARTHUR

I get by.

NAOMI

`It doesn't remotely matter how

much or what you spend it on' rich?

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Craziest thing you ever bought?

ARTHUR

I once inadvertently financed a

terrorist cell who said they needed

100,000 to open a falafel stall.

NAOMI

Oh my G-d, you're serious.

ARTHUR

What's the craziest thing you ever

told a tour party?

NAOMI

I once said the Manhattan we were

in was actually a movie set built

for `You've got Mail', but that

after the film wrapped, everyone

moved to the set because there was

less crime.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany

butter knife about two inches from

his hand but it might take him

eight months to dismember me with

it.

(PHONE BLEEPS)

Gotta go, battery. Love you too.

49.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Mom died last year. For eight

months dad ate nothing but Popeye's

Chicken n' Biscuits in front of

CSI. So I persuaded him to move in

with me. Where he eats Popeye's

Chicken n' Biscuits in front of

CSI.

ARTHUR

Sounds like you're very good to

him.

NAOMI

What are you gonna do? All those

years your folks tucked you in, did

their best to stop you from eating

crap in front of the TV. And then

one day, you're the one saying `No,

honey, it's bad for you! Go to

bed.' Weird, huh?

ARTHUR

(not relating at all)

Yeah. I hate that.

(looks at her phone)

Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you

find that?

NAOMI

AT&T store in 1998.

ARTHUR

It's...You've had it twelve years?

NAOMI

It's a fine phone. Battery life of

eleven seconds, which cuts the crap

right out of conversations.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

I can't believe these mofos who

gotta keep up with the latest

bullshit. CDs come along, so out

with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,

out with the CDs. I just kept the

vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be

incredibly hip once every 20

years....

50.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

ARTHUR

I couldn't decide between picnic in

the park and dinner with a view. So

it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it

ace?

NAOMI

No it is not ace, you crazy English

bastard! This is dangerous!

ARTHUR

Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put

these on.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

(LAUGHING)

Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe.

It's this company called `Aerial

Delights'. They specialise in

catering unusual events at a height

of 180 feet above the ground.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

So what got you into the walking

tours?

NAOMI

You're seriously making date small

talk while this is going on?

ARTHUR

Be still. Breathe deep.

(strikes a Zen pose)

`When you can be calm in the midst

of activity, this is the true state

of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.

51.

NAOMI

`Lower this freak show to the

ground and get me a cab': Naomi

Snart.

ARTHUR

(handing her something)

Taste this truffle.

NAOMI

What the hell. Gotta go sometime,

right? At least it won't be years

of pain like mom. Just a few

seconds of screaming and falling

with a truffle in my mouth.

ARTHUR

So anyway. The tours...

NAOMI

(CALMING HERSELF)

Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still.

The tours are a temporary nine year

fill-in until I'm drowned in a

tsunami of apologies from everyone

who failed to recognise my writing

genius first time round.

ARTHUR

What did you write?

NAOMI

A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a

childrens' publisher. Sunshine

Press'. The rejection letter was

the meanest thing I ever read.

ARTHUR

Kids can be so cruel...

NAOMI

(INTERRUPTING)

Arthur? We have a problem.

52.

ARTHUR

I told you, don't worry. These

crane people know what they're

doing!

NAOMI

Not that kind of problem.

JUNKIE

Phone. And the watch. Hurry.

ARTHUR

Um. Out of interest, how did you

get up here?

JUNKIE

What you talkin' about, dog?

NAOMI

Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed

by `Robbed in the sky'!

NAOMI (CONT'D)

This isn't funny, you lunatic.

ARTHUR AND NAOMI

NOOOO!

ARTHUR

OWWW! You don't understand! We're

180 feet up in the sky!

JUNKIE

(LAUGHS)

You on the same shit as me, yeah?

Good stuff, right?

53.

ARTHUR

No, we're not high! Well we are,

but only in the literal sense.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

(TO NAOMI)

Hit the panic button! It's next to

the truffle station!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hurry!

NAOMI

I can't find it. Over here?

ARTHUR

No! That's the bouquet of world

hams!

CUT TO:

ARTHUR

I had fun tonight.

NAOMI

I can't believe I'm saying this,

but so did I.

54.

ERICA

Summarising Phase Alpha: formal

wear for bridal attendants, groom's

attendants, mens' formal wear, St

John the Divine all confirmed...

ARTHUR

(TO TAILOR)

Are there breathing holes in the

coffin?

TAILOR

I'm sorry?

ARTHUR

In case I'm passed out drunk rather

than medically dead?

ERICA

Don't worry, Thomas. This whole

thing's just a joke to Arthur.

ARTHUR

(VERY AFFECTIONATE)

Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to

me.

VIVIENNE

Take this away.

(TO ERICA)

Progress on the reception?

ERICA

Black inked at the Emery Roth Room

at the Ritz-Carlton.

55.

ERICA (CONT'D)

A first pass at the guest list.

Bride's family and friends:

ERICA (CONT'D)

Groom's family and friends:

ERICA (CONT'D)

We can arrange to screen off the

area behind your guests, Arthur. To

make it seem less desperate.

ARTHUR

Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too

colourful and this hangover's a 7.6

on the Richter..the Sickter...

ERICA

Cakes, caterers, floral

arrangements, photographer...

HOBSON

Will there be anything else, sir?

ARTHUR

No, thanks.

HOBSON

(TO VIVIENNE)

Ma'am?

VIVIENNE

No. You can leave.

ARTHUR

Why all this crap now? What's the

rush anyway?

BURT

The wedding is in a month, Arthur.

56.

ARTHUR

A month? I was thinking more sort

of ten, fifteen years. Just to

really enjoy the anticipation of

the big day.

ERICA

Where are you going?

ARTHUR

(gets out his cellphone)

Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower,

Operation Ball and Chain will have

to wait.

ARTHUR

Here we are.

NAOMI

We're not going to end up in the

Hudson again, are we?

ARTHUR

I can promise you won't get wet.

CUT TO:

NAOMI

Are you okay?

ARTHUR

Yeah, fine. Actually...

57.

NAOMI

Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go

somewhere really romantic?

ARTHUR

Everything is 99 cents?

NAOMI

Yip. A whole penny less than those

bourgeois assholes at the Dollar

Store.

ARTHUR

`Warning: This product contains

chromium, which may be linked to

chronic bronchitis and reproductive

hazards."

NAOMI

That one was on the news. Everyone

else recalled them, the pussies.

Not my 99 Cent!

ARTHUR

Maybe China's trying to wipe out

the west's children one by one.

NAOMI

Oh, I love this place.

ARTHUR

Why?

58.

NAOMI

Well, I'd like you to believe it's

because I'm a poor girl reduced to

buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-

a-can to Right Said Fred because I

don't know where my next paycheck

is coming from. But the truth is -

bargains get me hot. Got it from

ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?

ARTHUR

Yes please.

NAOMI

Looking west, the ladies' hygiene

products. Note that the more

natural-sounding the name, e.g.

this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine

Spray, the more lethal chemicals it

contains. Watch out for the

products cunningly labelled to make

the dumber consumer think they're

getting the real thing: 'Special

J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt

Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...

LOCA'

NAOMI (CONT'D)

And ah, the music: Dated sounds for

lonely people to buy cheap shit to.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

I once watched a woman shoplift an

8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her

panty hose to 'Everything I do, I

do it for you'.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Why are you staring at me?

ARTHUR

Just fascinated.

59.

NAOMI

You're good at fascinated.

ARTHUR

You're good at fascinating.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Are you okay? Let me help you.

OLD WOMAN

Not that one.

ARTHUR

(offers her another)

This one?

OLD WOMAN

(shaking the tin)

No. There's less beans in it.

ARTHUR

This one?

OLD WOMAN

(sniffs the tin)

No.

ARTHUR

This one?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

No. I think I hear a mouse inside.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No

rodents. Packed.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Quick, before someone gets it.

60.

OLD WOMAN

(TO NAOMI)

You got a good one here, honey.

ARTHUR

Look. Us in a year's time.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

If you got ill, I'd care for you.

NAOMI

I'll get ill.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get

out when they start playing Phil

Collins. Want to see how to get a

quarter from a shopping cart?

ERICA

Tiger Woods has confirmed!

ARTHUR

I didn't know you knew him.

SUSAN

I don't.

ARTHUR

Why is he coming?

SUSAN

He agreed to daddy's fee. This is

going to be the happiest day of my

life!

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Why is she here all the time?

61.

ARTHUR

If you can bring Erica, I can bring

Hobson.

SUSAN

She's my wedding planner.

ARTHUR

She's my Hobson.

HOBSON

(WHISPERING)

Tell Naomi. That's an order.

ARTHUR

Reminiscent of a French castle

perched 500 feet above New York,

the penthouse was known from early

days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.

NAOMI

A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta

have a second ballroom.

ARTHUR

Where George Gershwin and the

Astors danced to Shep Fields and

his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred

Austere and Stingy Rogers.

NAOMI

(PULLING AWAY)

I just need one of your collection

of bathrooms.

ARTHUR

Behind the telephone box fish tank.

See you on the balcony.

62.

NAOMI

Hobson?

HOBSON

He's not like other men, you know.

NAOMI

I think I realised that as I

plunged into the Hudson with a

junkie. But I like him. He's fun.

HOBSON

I know he is. That's the problem.

NAOMI

What does that mean?

HOBSON

I'm sure Arthur will explain.

ARTHUR

Your kids' book. What was it about?

NAOMI

`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an

asthmatic boy detective.

ARTHUR

Be serious.

NAOMI

Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose

Heart Escaped'. It was about this

kid who wakes up to find his heart

has climbed out and is shinning

down the drainpipe to freedom.

ARTHUR

I love it.

63.

NAOMI

Rainbow Press said it was too

disturbing. But it wasn't literal -

there wasn't a kid lying there with

a gaping hole in his chest. It was

just this cute little heart

bouncing up and down shouting `You

can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm

paraphrasing.

ARTHUR

Did he catch the heart?

NAOMI

Never got that far.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

You like the hooch, don't you?

ARTHUR

Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.

There's this bit in a book Hobson

used to read me as a kid that says

it all: `We must stop eating

cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he

ate another.'

NAOMI

Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and

Toad!

ARTHUR

(FROM MEMORY)

`Frog put the cookies in a box.

`There' he said. Now we will not

eat any more cookies.' `But we can

open the box.' Frog tied some

string around the box. `There' he

said, `Now we will not eat any more

cookies'. `But we can cut the

string and open the box'.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

So Frog took the box outside. He

shouted in a loud voice, `Hey

birds, here are cookies!' Birds

came from everywhere. They picked

up all the cookies in their beaks

and flew away. `

(MORE)

64.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Now we have no more cookies to eat'

`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going

home now to bake a cake.'

(BEAT)

Classic addict.

NAOMI

That was beautiful. It's like you

read it yesterday.

HOBSON (OOV)

Frog and Toad stayed on the island

all afternoon.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

They ate wet sandwiches without

iced tea. They were two close

friends sitting alone together.

ARTHUR

I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She

isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my

toad.

HOBSON

You're quite sure about this?

ARTHUR

Yes.

HOBSON

(under her breath)

Oh, bollocks.

65.

RALPH

I don't know, honey. What's this

teabag even doing here? Couldn't he

make it in Lord of the Rings land?

NAOMI

Not that it matters, but he's a

billionaire.

RALPH

You have my full permission to

marry him.

GRANT

Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!

ARTHUR

I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning

to ride you around the course next.

Her last boyfriend broke his ankle

jumping that ditch. Had to be

destroyed on the spot.

VIVIENNE

Arthur. What's so urgent that you

had to come all the way out here?

ARTHUR

I'm in love. With a woman who isn't

exactly who you'd describe as

Susan. She's called Naomi.

VIVIENNE

Arthur, we've been through this!

ARTHUR

Won't you at least meet her?

VIVIENNE

What family is she from?

ARTHUR

The Snarts of Detroit.

66.

VIVIENNE

Never heard of them.

ARTHUR

No, because they're normal. She's a

walking tour guide, her dad's a

retired car worker.

VIVIENNE

Susan will generate quality sons,

not oil-soaked car monkeys.

ARTHUR

Unbelievable! Why don't you just

keep me here, pay a servant to wank

me into a bottle once a day...

VIVIENNE

Arthur...

ARTHUR

...then inject it all into a field

of heiresses and see who farts out

a thoroughbred first?

VIVIENNE

We need an heir!

ARTHUR

Fine! You can have one with Stevey

Steroids here! Surely even your

uterus has had a face lift by now.

GRANT

(STEPPING IN)

That's enough, Arthur...

ARTHUR

None of your business, J Crew.

GRANT

You are so ungrateful to your

mother. She adores you!

VIVIENNE

Arthur. Come back here.

ARTHUR

You can shove your inheritance up

your horse's arse!

67.

VIVIENNE

Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your

heart. But do be aware I consider

what you've squandered so far an

advance on your inheritance. That's

about $17 million.

ARTHUR

Why would you do that? You'd never

get it back.

VIVIENNE

No. But you'd spend the rest of

your life in court. There's a

simple solution to all this. Marry

Susan. And cheat with the nobody

from Queens.

NAOMI

Have you been at the cookies?

ARTHUR

I ate the whole jar.

NAOMI

(realising it's serious)

Oh, man. What? What?

ARTHUR

I'm engaged. To another Susan.

Woman. Engaged to another woman.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

NAOMI

What are you talking about? This is

bullshit. Who do you think you are?

Is this some rich guy thing?

ARTHUR

I was going to tell you! I just...

68.

NAOMI

Yeah, yeah, you just.

ARTHUR

Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it

to get to this! I planned to just

be your friend but then I started

to fall for you and I thought `I

can't marry Susan, I might fall for

Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to

marry Susan or I'll be poor so I

won't fall for Naomi' But then I

did fall for you! Because you're

brainy and funny and gorgeous and

too smart to do walking tours.

You're too smart, Snart. Smart

Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.

(BEAT)

Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,

and I said `I can't marry Susan, I

love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I

don't know any more.

NAOMI

You're frog.

ARTHUR

Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if

you don't marry Susan, I'll make

you pay all the inheritance money

back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.

Okay she didn't laugh but she might

as well have, the evil cow. Because

it's like all the money ever and

they'll put not just me but both of

us in prison and your dad, like in

Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and

Oliver and....

NAOMI

Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of

your personality earlier we

wouldn't be having this

conversation.

ARTHUR

Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?

69.

NAOMI

Why?

ARTHUR

'cause it'll reduce the proportion

of my life I'll spend feeling

utterly miserable.

NAOMI

Bye, Arthur.

ARTHUR

Bea Arthur? What's she got to do

with all this?

NAOMI

It's going to be okay. I'll get you

a beer, yeah?

RALPH

I just have to be alone for a

minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear

it...

70.

NAOMI

(YAWNS)

Designed by William Van Allen and

inspired by the machine age of the

1920s, the Chrysler...

RUDE MALE TOURIST

Hey. I got a question.

NAOMI

Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants

to come home with me and butt in

with questions while I'm watching

Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'

(BEAT)

Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,

long day. What's your question?

71.

RUDE MALE TOURIST

How can I just let you walk away,

just let you leave without a trace?

FEMALE TOURIST

When I stand here taking every

breath with you, ooh...

MALE TOURIST 2

You're the only one who really knew

me at all.

NAOMI

What is going on?

OLD FEMALE TOURIST

How can you just walk away from me,

when all I can do is watch you

leave?

TEENAGE BOY TOURIST

'cause we've shared the laughter

and the pain...

NEWSSTAND GUY

And even shared the tears.

NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)

You're the only one who really knew

me at all.

ARTHUR

(lip syncing too)

So take a look at me now, 'cause

there's just an empty space.

And there's nothing left here to

remind me, just the memory of your

face.

(MORE)

72.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Take a look at me now, `cause

there's just an empty space, And

you coming back to me is against

all odds and that's what I've got

to face...Just take a look at me

now.

NAOMI

Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.

he's getting married. But I guess

he didn't choreograph that bit for

you.

ARTHUR

But..but this took ages to

rehearse. I had the frog outfit

specially made. These aren't actual

tourists.

NAOMI

I gathered that, Arthur. Are you

capable of doing anything without

it being a grand gesture?

ARTHUR

What do you mean?

NAOMI

It's like Hobson said. You're not

like other men. If you were normal,

if the money and the booze didn't

cloud everything, you'd deal with

the fact that you're engaged,

rather than just looking for ways

to win me back. But it was a lovely

routine, really. Fantastic outfit.

ARTHUR

I just wanted to see you.

NAOMI

(SYMPATHETIC)

You need to see someone, Arthur.

Seriously.

73.

ARTHUR

Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a

haircut! Hobson?

MARTY

It says here you shouldn't forget

to clean your junk. I guess that's

what...'genitahlio-ah' is.

ARTHUR

Marty? What are you doing there?

MARTY

Hobson left me in charge. She's

gone to bed. She had a headache.

ARTHUR

She's had quite a few headaches

lately.

MARTY

She blacked out.

HOBSON

Put my bears back on, Arthur.

ARTHUR

Not until you answer my question.

HOBSON

I'm travelling down a white tunnel.

To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why

is it so hot? Who's the red

gentleman with the big pitchfork?

ARTHUR

Will you cut it out?

74.

HOBSON

Arthur. There are three books. This

is important. Take them back to the

library...

ARTHUR

Hobson, please. Don't die any more.

It's getting very boring.

HOBSON

Arthur. Old women, like bears, get

sore heads. Are you okay? You look

a little lost.

ARTHUR

Naomi doesn't want to see me.

HOBSON

A terrible shame she had to go. A

little tart like that could have

saved you a fortune in prostitutes.

ARTHUR

Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk

about Naomi that way again. What

gives you the right to be such a

snob? You're just...you're just...

Mary Poppins with a menopause!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hobson, I've never raised my voice

to you. I'm sorry.

HOBSON

I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,

you may be growing up.

ARTHUR

Do you want anything?

HOBSON

I want to be younger.

ARTHUR

Sorry, it's your job to be older.

(THINKS)

Hobson. If you're feeling better

tomorrow, will you accompany me

somewhere?

75.

HOBSON

Of course, Arthur.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

How do I look?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I can't have this getting out. I'm

in the public eye.

HOBSON

Yes, it would be disastrous to harm

such a dignified profile.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

It's going to be okay, Arthur.

MEGAN

I was waking up four, five, six

mornings a week in different mens'

beds...

MEGAN (CONT'D)

I wanted to die. To be nobody.

JAMES

I steal from my friends, my family.

I sold my son's pedal car so I

could score junk...

76.

ARTHUR

Jesus....

JAMES

I accidentally backed my car over

my mother outside Walgreens...

HOBSON

(WHISPERS)

Marty! This isn't a sports bar in

Chicago. These people aren't here

to brag.

JAMES

(SOBBING)

I had a business, a home and it's

all gone! I'm in this fucking grave

and they're pouring the earth in!

ARTHUR

Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know

about anyone else, but this isn't

exactly killing my thirst.

LEADER

Well why did you come...What's your

name?

ARTHUR

Gandalf.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, you're not going to

convince me my life isn't fun.

(TO JAMES)

And no offence but if I ran over my

mother, I'd be out celebrating.

Which is what I plan to do right

now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.

WOMAN (O.S)

I'm Jane. And I believe I have a

dependence on alcohol...

77.

HOBSON

...and because I have done nothing

with the astonishing opportunities

handed to me, apart from pissing

away my inheritance and drinking

enough to kill a rhino.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

But imagine being me! I once ended

up in bed with the daughters of

three of the Rolling Stones. But a)

I don't remember a thing about it,

b) apparently I was sick on two of

the women before c) losing control

of my bladder on the third. All

such fun...until the strangers I

pay to be my friends have gone, the

fog parts and there's a hole so

big, you could pour all the

champagne in the world into it and

never fill it up. But I've got so

much potential, a good heart, I'm a

good person, even if I've

completely wasted my short,

precious life because I somehow

convinced myself that happiness is

a Komodo dragon, a case of booze

and the memory of having once

stripped naked to Beethoven for a

coachload of German tourists who I

met outside the Rainforest Cafe.

ARTHUR

It's always the quiet ones.

ARTHUR

Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go

every time I crave a drink?

78.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Susan? Look, I know the wedding

date is set. But fancy bringing it

forward? I just want to get it over

with. In a good way. Think about

it, yeah?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

It's the agony of possibility,

Hobson. It just hurts too much to

know I could still be with Naomi if

I had the guts.

HOBSON

Just promise you'll never ask me to

sleep with Susan for you.

NAOMI

Arthur, if that's...

(BEAT)

Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.

Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty

hard on it..Love to...Love

to...What time?

NAOMI (CONT'D)

I'll call in dead to work. Bye.

HOBSON

Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi

here?

79.

RALPH

You must be the nanny.

HOBSON

I must be.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

Please stop this, I can't inhale

and am in danger of treading on one

of your knuckles.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

If you and your undershirt would

walk two paces back I could enter

this dwelling.

NAOMI

Well, well.

RALPH

Ever since I met Arthur I liked

him. We have to make sure these two

wonderful kids stay together...

HOBSON

Try not to talk. It's not your

words but the breath which bears

them. Perhaps you could repair to

the East Wing and make me a cup of

tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.

RALPH

Sure, sure.

HOBSON

Arthur is having a pre-wedding

party tonight. You should come.

NAOMI

Oh, should I? Are all the other

girls he passed up going too?

80.

HOBSON

Don't you want to show Arthur how

well you're doing?

NAOMI

Tell him thanks, but I have a

deadline.

HOBSON

Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's

far too decent to be involved in

something so tawdry. You could

bring your father. A magical

experience before he's too big to

leave this apartment.

NAOMI

(DISBELIEF)

Why would I go to this? Why would I

do that to myself?

HOBSON

My dear, if there's one thing old

women can tell, it's young men in

love. And the food promises to be

breathtakingly free.

NAOMI

Are you alright?

HOBSON

Better than you, dear.

NAOMI

You really look out for Arthur,

don't you?

HOBSON

Yes. And it is a job that I

recommend highly.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

You really look out for this

gentleman, from what I've heard.

NAOMI

Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill

pet shelter won't take him.

81.

HOBSON

Thank you. Would you go the

bathroom and commence washing? You

only have three hours and it could

be quite a project.

NAOMI

I appreciate what you're trying to

do but I'm not going to that party.

HOBSON

Suit yourself.

NAOMI

Have you seen a doctor?

HOBSON

Yes. And he has seen me.

NAOMI

I think Arthur has a very good

friend. May I kiss you on the

cheek?

HOBSON

Is it something you feel strongly

about?

NAOMI

Yes.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Dad! Call 911.

82.

VOCALIST

Thanks. We're going to move things

up tempo now with `The Only Thing

That Looks Good On Me Is You.'

VIVIENNE

Splendid affair, Susan.

SUSAN

Don't thank me, thank Erica.

NAOMI

With all due respect, Hobson,

you're talking out of your frumpy

English ass. Arthur needs to know!

HOBSON

You are not to pull him out of that

party on my behalf.

(BEAT)

Hello? Naomi!

RALPH

You're gonna get through this,

babe. Then who knows what the

future may hold?

DOOR MAN

Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?

83.

NAOMI

Snart plus one.

PASSING WOMAN

Nice dress. Vera Wang?

NAOMI

Ross Dress For Less. You know where

Arthur is?

PASSING WOMAN

(SHRUGS)

Sorry.

BURT

When Arthur proposed to my

daughter, I was overjoyous. The

Bach-Templemeads are my kind of

people: classy. Respectable. Well

spoken. People like in Shakespeare

in Love, who esprouse the same

values I have always upheld both in

my business and spiritual life. But

tonight isn't about me or America's

leading independent formula brand.

ARTHUR

Thank you, Burt! I've actually

prepared a little surprise song

with my friends here.

84.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Why does cash suddenly appear,

every time you are near?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Just like me, it longs to be, close

to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the

sky, all of which, I can buy...

(STOPS)

I'll sing a proper song.

(SINGS)

You say potayto and I say potahto,

You say tomayto and I say tomahto,

potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,

Let's call the whole thing off! You

say AA, and I say `no way', you say

`Red Bull' and I say `Go away,

Rehab, No way, Red Bull...

JUSTIN

We meet again!

NAOMI

Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?

JUSTIN

The ballroom. I'll take you to him.

JUSTIN (CONT'D)

I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.

JUSTIN (CONT'D)

Isn't she beautiful?

NAOMI

Of course she is. Why would Arthur

marry a pig?

85.

JUSTIN

What business is your family in?

NAOMI

Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a

fortune built on small pets.

JUSTIN

I'm sorry?

NAOMI

Hamsters, mice, doglets...

JUSTIN

Doglets?

NAOMI

Tiny dogs. The technology's not

perfect. Seeing a horse the size of

a can of soup fall dead before your

eyes - that shit stays with you.

NAOMI

Are you sure he's this way?

JUSTIN

Absolutely.

NAOMI

(to a WOMAN)

Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?

WOMAN

That way. The ballroom.

NAOMI

Bye, Justin.

DOOR MAN

Excuse me, madam. You're not an

authorized guest.

86.

NAOMI

I know that. I'm here to give

Arthur some very important news.

DOOR MAN

Of course you are.

(takes her arm)

Shall we discuss this outside?

NAOMI

(SHOUTS)

Get your hands off me!

ARTHUR

It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.

NAOMI

Arthur, can I talk to you?

MAN IN A WHITE COAT

We ran tests. It was just a dizzy

spell. We'll be sending her home

tonight.

ARTHUR

But what about the other blackouts?

HOBSON

Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that

party.

HOBSON (O.S, OFF)

Especially now that Naomi is there.

ARTHUR

She's fine. They're sending her

home. Do you want a drink?

87.

NAOMI

No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.

ARTHUR

But you came all this way. There's

ridiculously fancy food, there's...

NAOMI

Arthur. Please. Can you just call

me a cab?

ARTHUR

You're a cab.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Shit. Hobson usually...

NAOMI

Orders cabs to take the girls away?

ARTHUR

Thank you for coming all this way.

I'm sorry for all the stupid

presents and calls and gestures.

NAOMI

It's okay.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

She was a looker from the get-go.

ARTHUR

What were you like as a kid?

NAOMI

Nuts. I thought the moon followed

me. I would walk and think the moon

went any place that I did. I

thought it meant something special

would happen. So I've been waiting.

What an ass.

88.

ARTHUR

Dance?

NAOMI

Arthur. We've been through this.

Call that cab please.

MANDY MILLER

To Bombay, a travelling circus

came, they brought an intelligent

elephant and Nellie was her name...

NAOMI

(LAUGHING)

What the bejeezus is this?

ARTHUR

Hobson used to sing it to me.

(SINGING ALONG)

One dark night, she slipped her

iron chain. Off she ran to

Hindustan and was never seen again.

Nellie the Elephant packed her

bags, And said goodbye to the

circus, Off she went with a

trumpety trump, Trump trump

trump...

VIVIENNE

Is this the tour guide?

ARTHUR

She's a writer.

NAOMI

Is this the Vivienne?

VIVIENNE

Crowded field, writing.

89.

ARTHUR

Maybe someone will see her

potential.

VIVIENNE

We all know who's seen her

potential.

NAOMI

Meaning?

VIVIENNE

Oh, of course, you don't know, do

you?

ARTHUR

Vivienne, please. Don't...

NAOMI

What is going on here?

VIVIENNE

My son became fond of you. You're

not the first. Or the last, I

imagine. Anyway I was scanning his

monthly expenses - which always

makes for entertaining reading, all

those gifts for all those girls -

and found he'd bought an entire

publishing company called...what

was it now? Rainbow Press.

NAOMI

You bought Rainbow press? So you

could tell them to publish my book?

VIVIENNE

He knows people, dear. I'm sure you

do too, though the people you know

tend not to own books, let alone

publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll

see you back at the party? Susan's

a little worried.

ARTHUR

NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I

would ever see you again. I was

just trying to give you some...

90.

NAOMI

(GASPS)

Confidence? Self esteem isn't a

gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat

or a thousand billion orchids or an

apartment made from truffles or

whatever else you rich freaks use

to express love!

ARTHUR

I do express love! I love you!

NAOMI

Don't say that!

ARTHUR

You just told me to! And stop going

on about me being rich! You think

it's easy being trapped by money?

NAOMI

Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!

Arthur's being held against his

will in Guantamoney Bay!

ARTHUR

Abu Greed?

NAOMI

Stop riffing with me! How dare you

do what you did. I didn't need your

money to feel good about myself!

ARTHUR

No. Being cheap gives you that.

NAOMI

Huh?

ARTHUR

At least I'm prepared to have fun.

To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at

me with my antique food, aren't I

cool?' And...and...your phone's

RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old

doorbell and vibrator, I bet you

can only get calls from 1994 on it!

91.

NAOMI

(BOILS OVER)

As long as I don't get any from a

drunk, rich fuck up like you!

SUSAN

Hello? I heard shouting.

NAOMI

I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came

to complain about the conditions.

ARTHUR

Naomi, please...

NAOMI

Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you

thought putting half and half in

the staff kitchen was an

improvement.

(REALLY ANGRY)

But some people prefer Coffee Mate!

You were disrespectful. I quit!

SUSAN

Because you changed the creamer?

(BEAT)

Arthur, Marty called from the

hospital.

ARTHUR

It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke

to her doctor.

SUSAN

Apparently you didn't.

HOBSON

It's just a headache!

ARTHUR

Stop saying that! You bribed a

hospital orderly to tell me you

were okay!

92.

HOBSON

Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors

know?

ARTHUR

Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing

costly, health-giving presents!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..

(reads the DVD)

`A compilation of the band's most

stomach-churning music videos and

deathly live performances...'

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Put this on, please.

HOBSON

I don't want to put it on.

ARTHUR

Put it on. Or I'll fire you.

(PAUSE)

Okay, or I won't fire you.

HOBSON

(VADER VOICE)

How much did you waste on this

poppycock?

HOBSON (CONT'D)

(VADER VOICE)

I see you've decided not to grow up

after all.

MARTY

She sounds like Darth Invader!

HOBSON

Why, Arthur?

93.

VOICEOVER (O.S.)

Stargazer, known for her

distinctive white mottled back...

VOICEOVER (CONT'D)

...is determined to catch the

salmon, despite the treacherous

rapids...

DOCTOR

Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a

moment?

ARTHUR

Home? That's great news. Isn't it?

ARTHUR

How did this get here?

HOBSON

I have no idea.

ARTHUR

You might have a brain tumour but

you're not a complete veggie burger

just yet. Has Naomi been here?

94.

HOBSON

She dropped by once or twice.

Frightful needy trollop.

ARTHUR

I thought she gave up writing.

HOBSON

Just trying to spare her outright

humiliation while I'm still here.

ARTHUR

Don't wear yourself out. You're not

going anywhere soon.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

World's most advanced heart rate

monitor. The tiniest problem will

alert your own private platoon of

paramedics camped out downstairs...

HOBSON

Arthur. I've loved caring for you

so much. But you'll never grow up

with me around. So either I retire.

Or I die. Option 1 involves too

much paperwork and blather with

having to find somewhere else to

live. And no offence to you, dear

boy...

HOBSON (CONT'D)

...but I think we've exhausted the

bear-based entertainment. Which

leaves option 2.

HOBSON (CONT'D)

You're a good son, Arthur. You can

do anything with your life that you

want. Just like I did.

95.

ARTHUR

But you spent half of it looking

after a spoilt drunk twat.

HOBSON

Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my

use-by date.

ARTHUR

Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this

one. I need you to care for me.

(holds up a pill)

Now take your fish oil.

ARTHUR

Hobson?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

HOBSON!

(hammering the machine)

Why the fuck has the stupid thing

not gone off?

(SHOUTS)

GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT...

96.

ARTHUR

Would Frog ever get up again? Or

would he just sit in his tank,

crying and soiling himself until he

died of dehydration because he

didn't even have the energy to eat

a wet sandwich.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hobson! Why are you in there when I

need you?

(lifts lid off urn)

HOBSON!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Arrrrgghhh!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Sorry.

MARTY

How's the tea?

ARTHUR

Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.

MARTY

Want to talk about the Cubs game?

ARTHUR

Nahhh. Can I be alone please?

97.

ARTHUR

(leaving a message)

Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get

this, because your voicemail

probably consists of a 4000 year

old woman who writes the message

down in hieroglyphics then loses it

down the back of her incontinence

loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson

died and I've fallen apart...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Marty! Can you get that? Marty!

(INTO PHONE)

Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?

VIVIENNE

Arthur! You haven't answered the

phone for eight days. Susan's

beside herself. What's going on?

98.

ARTHUR

What do you think's going on?

Hobson died.

VIVIENNE

Oh, that.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

(TO MAIDS)

Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio!

Come on, Arthur. Have to pick

yourself up, lad. It's like when

Nixon my Great Dane had to be put

down. Frightful state for days. But

I pulled myself together.

ARTHUR

You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?

VIVIENNE

Well, yes. A faithful, humble

companion who...

ARTHUR

Um, I think I'd like you to leave,

if that's okay. Now?

VIVIENNE

Remember who pays for this

apartment, Arthur. For everything!

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

You had damn well better be at that

wedding, boy.

ARTHUR

Don't worry. If I'm going to drink

myself to death I'll need

resources. Bye Vivienne...

VIVIENNE

It's mother!

ARTHUR

My mother's dead.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hello? I'm sorry?

99.

AHERNE

The last will and testament of Jane

Hobson.

(READS)

`I leave my life savings to the

Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare

County, California.'

ARTHUR

That'll explain the strong smell of

bear shit. Sorry.

AHERNE

To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave

this.

AHERNE (CONT'D)

To operate kettle, press red

button. Milk in refrigerator;

that's the big box with the pretty

light that comes on when you open

the door.

(PAUSE)

Arthur. You're going to be okay.

Now it's your turn to look after

someone. All my deepest, fondest

love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling

down at you - or more likely, up at

you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.

100.

BURT

I just want you to know, if he

doesn't show up for this wedding, I

can't know what I'll do.

VIVIENNE

Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned

himself up. He's stopped drinking,

he's anxious to get a real job.

He's become a responsible citizen.

NAOMI

Due to a tragic error in the

architect's drawing, the original

Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886

was just seven inches tall. 100,000

New Yorkers rioted, having come

expecting to see something more

impressive than a garden gnome

holding up an ice cream...

ARTHUR

Naomi!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

You're on a bus? With a microphone?

NAOMI

Girl's gotta have a dream.

ARTHUR

Naomi. Can you take the next 60

years off?

NAOMI

Are you okay? You're a mess. You

look like you...now.

ARTHUR

Sorry. I accidentally swallowed

three bottles of hand sanitizer.

Fascinating story...Okay.

(MORE)

101.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Drinking was the only way I could

get the courage to come here and

say this: I don't need the money. I

love the money. But I don't lie

awake all night wondering how I'll

live without ever seeing it again.

I just wonder what it's like to go

24 hours without a steak tartare.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

The American Express Centurion card

$250,000 a year to keep it, which I

blow in a quiet week.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

(SHOUTS)

Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong

wore to step on the sun!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

These are from The Gap.

NAOMI

I'm so sorry about Hobson.

ARTHUR

I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.

NAOMI

It's okay. So how did Susan take it

that you're not marrying her?

ARTHUR

She didn't.

NAOMI

You haven't told her?

ARTHUR

What's it to you? She's your arch-

enemy.

NAOMI

Are you six? She isn't my enemy.

She's the woman you proposed to!

ARTHUR

I couldn't tell her! Today's the

biggest day of her life!

NAOMI

The wedding's today? When?

103.

ARTHUR

12. Which is...

(looks at his wrist)

Where's my watch gone?

NAOMI

(looks at her watch)

It's eight minutes to.

ARTHUR

It's too late, then.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I don't know her number! It's in my

phone's address book in that gloop.

NAOMI

Church?

ARTHUR

St. John the Divine. Can we please

just get me some clothes...

NAOMI

St John..Fourth largest church in

the world...111th and Amsterdam.

It's about four miles. Better

hurry.

ARTHUR

You want me to go there? Like this?

NAOMI

What's the alternative? Jilt Susan

at the altar? Can I expect the same

treatment when you dump me?

ARTHUR

No! I love you!

NAOMI

C'mon, folks...

ARTHUR

Naomi! Susan's dad will...

104.

NAOMI

Arthur. Prove you're not the same

pampered little boy who can have

what he wants then toss it aside

when he's bored. Then we'll talk.

ARTHUR

Naomi! I don't even know the way!

NAOMI

5th...right on Broadway...left at

Times...Right on 7th...back on

Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The

church is the big stone pointy

thing full of rich people.

ARTHUR

SHIT! TAXI!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Um, can anyone spare...

(to the DRIVER)

How much to St. John the Divine

please?

DRIVER

About 15 bucks...

ARTHUR

(to the crowd)

Can anyone spare $15 please?

DRIVER

What about tip? You cheapskate?

ARTHUR

30?

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Stop! STOP!

105.

ARTHUR

(SHOUTS)

Gather round for the nearly naked

Yoga man - YOGI BARE! I give you...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

TAXI!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

How far can I go with $1.95 and a

Japanese coin with a hole in it?

106.

DRIVER

A block and a half.

ARTHUR

GO!

ARTHUR

(TO PASSERBY)

Excuse me, are there trains down

there, like in films?

PASSERBY

Yes.

ARTHUR

(to A MALE PASSENGER)

Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother

you, but...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Crikey. Thanks.

107.

NAOMI

(into a headset mic)

...originally a rough

neighbourhood. Some say it was

called 42nd Street because it

wasn't safe to spend more than

forty seconds on it.

MALE TOURIST

Excuse me.

NAOMI

If you burst into song, you're off

this bus.

MALE TOURIST

Huh? I want to see St. John the

Divine.

NAOMI

Sorry, sir, that's not on our route

today. Anyway...

FEMALE TOURIST

I want to know if Arthur's gonna

make it.

OTHER FEMALE TOURIST (CONT'D)

You should be there for him.

MALE TOURIST

(WAVES LEAFLET)

It says here `ask about your

personalised tours'. I want the

personalised tour. To St. John the

Divine!

ALL OTHER TOURISTS

So do I! St. John the Divine, St.

John the Divine, St. John the...

108.

NAOMI

Okay!

ARTHUR

Ah! I'm trying to get to...

MANAGER

Hey!

POLICEMAN

(INTO MIC)

Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an

indecent exposure on a school bus.

109.

ARTHUR

I'm not him.

(shows his wrists)

Look ma! No holes.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Susan?

SUSAN

Arthur? What's going on?

ARTHUR

Susan. I can't...I can't...

SUSAN

What?

ARTHUR

The girl at the party? The one who

talked all that rubbish about

Coffee Mate? I love her.

SUSAN

Shut up! We're getting married!

ARTHUR

But I don't love you!

SUSAN

And you think I love you?

ARTHUR

Well, yes. What's not to...

110.

SUSAN

I never have.

ARTHUR

Susan, you're upset, you hate me.

It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to

go, or your dad's going to do

whatever he did to your boyfriend

from college.

SUSAN

Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her

parents to send her away..

ARTHUR

HER? You're..a...

SUSAN

Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed

that daddy is homophobic. He swore

he'd disown me if it happened

again.

ARTHUR

But...why do you want to marry...

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Hang on. Am I your beard?

SUSAN

Why else do you think I'd spend

more than 30 seconds in your

company? You're the perfect cover.

ARTHUR

(REELING)

Have you been pretending to like

Dane Cook as well?

SUSAN

No.

ARTHUR

Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...

(heads to the door)

Thanks for your honesty. I don't

feel so bad about calling this off.

111.

SUSAN

Arthur, please. You can drink as

much as you like, sneak off to

Naomi. We keep the money. We live

our lives. Everyone wins.

ARTHUR

I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.

But I won't marry a lesbian Dane

Cook fan.

ARTHUR

Good evening, St. John the Divine!

Anyone in from St. Patrick's?

Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan

Mosque? AA?

ARTHUR

...and the first turned to the

second horse and said `That dog

just spoke'.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

The joke being that it's

inconsistent that the horses can

speak but the dog can't.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

The wedding's off. The bride has

had second thoughts. I can't say I

blame her. Would you marry me?

(MORE)

112.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

(PAUSE)

You won't be seeing me again, as

I'm going to be poor. I'll be

shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six

pork chops for under a dollar!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Great. I'm glad we had this talk.

I'll let you get on with the

wedding....

SUSAN

Daddy, no! Stop it!

VIVIENNE

Burt! Get off my son!

SUSAN

(louder than anyone yet)

DADDY!!!

BURT

You wouldn't hurt me.

SUSAN

Wouldn't I? You crushed me.

BURT

I just wanted you to be happy.

SUSAN

Bullshit. You wanted to stop me

being a lesbian!

BURT

Shut up! Shut up you dirty little

dyke harlot!

113.

ERICA

You want some more, bitch? Huh?

SUSAN

Erica, that's enough, honey.

ARTHUR

Why didn't you tell me? We could

have worked something out.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

I'm joking.

ARTHUR

OW! Stop it! Why are you doing

that?

NAOMI

Because I hate an infection! Keep

still.

ARTHUR

No, you keep still.

NAOMI

What are we going to do, Arthur?

ARTHUR

I'll get a job. I'll model cheap

riding boots for people with no

horses. You can write books about

boys whose lungs have run away.

VIVIENNE

Stop this!

114.

VIVIENNE (CONT'D)

A Bach-Templemead has never been

poor and we're not about to try

that experiment with you, Arthur.

That said, you've shown strength of

character for once, instead of

blubbing on about frogs and

friendship. The inheritance is

yours. All I ask is, with Hobson

gone, you finally start treating me

like a mother.

ARTHUR

Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.

VIVIENNE

I beg your pardon?

ARTHUR

You've never earned that title. I

wouldn't fake it with Susan. I

won't with you.

VIVIENNE

Arthur. I will withdraw this offer

forever. Don't doubt me, boy.

ARTHUR

I don't.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

Take care, Viv.

VIVIENNE

Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If

you walk out of that door...

115.

ARTHUR

Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any

more. Fancy joining us for a bowl

of Special J?

FADE OUT

ARTHUR (O.S.)

OW!

ARTHUR (O.S.)

This is outrageous!

ARTHUR

Operational heat controls in a

shower are a basic human right!

116.

ARTHUR (O.S.)

Owww! My eyes! I'm blind!

ARTHUR (CONT'D)

What the hell's in this shampoo?

Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea

tree oil...

RALPH

Package for you. With any luck an

apartment for you and Lurch.

ARTHUR

I thought you liked me.

RALPH

I may have been seduced by money.

It happens.

ARTHUR

(reading it out)

`Can I be your friend at least?

Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch

sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is

yours. It always was.'

RALPH

On balance, I'd go for it.

MARTY

Money good.

NAOMI

You were never happy rich, honey.

It's only been a month. Be strong.

Remember: however hard life gets,

love will always find a way.

(MORE)

117.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

(off their stares:)

What? Can't a girl make a joke?

ARTHUR

Brought her for moral support. But

I'll do the talking this time.

FADE OUT
