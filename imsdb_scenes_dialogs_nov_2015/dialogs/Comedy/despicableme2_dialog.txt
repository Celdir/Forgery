DESPICABLE ME 2

Written by

Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio

EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY

Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a

windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences

sits in the middle of the wasteland.

TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.

At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an

overturned barrel as a table.

Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.

The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in

the pile of coins.

While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the

coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and

sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of

stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.

Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,

until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see

where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a

table flies up, knocking them over.

Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP

LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.

A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of

Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.

Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the

ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to

their guns.

A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.

Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from

the ground.

Then--

THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.

CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and

down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to

the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,

vehicles, and weapons.

The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the

snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-

potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can

reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He

closes the door.

INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being

carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL

Headquarters.

We see the back of several heads watching the footage.

There's a heavy sigh.

SILAS

Three weeks and we're still no

closer to cracking this?

SILAS (CONT'D)

Right... bring him in.

LUCY (O.S.)

Yes, sir.

AGNES

This is the best party EVER!!!

EDITH

Haha!   Yeah!

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3.

AGNES

Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

MARGO

Fear not, for here come the gallant

knights to save us!

GRU

No, no, no! What do you mean she's

not coming?! I have a backyard

full of these little girls who are

counting on a visit from a fairy

princess!

GRU (CONT'D)

Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   4.

GRU (CONT'D)

Listen! I don't want a refund! I

want a fairy princess... please!

Please, I am begging you.

(Resigned)

You know what? I hope that you can

sleep at night, you crusher of

little girls' dreams!!!

AGNES

Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess

coming?

GRU

Any minute now!

AGNES

Yayyy!

GRU

Stall them.

MARGO

Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.

That's enough of the magic show!

MINIONS

Awwww.

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.

MARGO

Wait, did you hear that? It

sounded like the twinkling sounds

of magical fairy dust.

AGNES

(gasps)

It's the fairy princess!   She's

coming!

MARGO

Look!

GRU

Aaaaaahh!

GRU (CONT'D)

(in falsetto)

It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The

most magical fairy princess of all!

And I am here to wish Princess

Agnes a very happy birthday!

LITTLE GIRL

How come you're tho fat?

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    6.

GRU

Because my house is made of candy

and sometimes I eat instead of

facing my problems.

LITTLE GIRL

How come you have-

GRU

Okay!   Time for cake!

AGNES

Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're

the best fairy princess ever!

GRU

(in falsetto)

You are welcome, little girl.

AGNES

(whispers in his ear)

I know it's really you, Gru. I'm

just pretending for the other kids.

JILLIAN

Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the

Party!

GRU

(forcing a smile)

Hello, Jillian.

JILLIAN

Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb

here, but my friend Natalie is

recently single, and...

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.

GRU

(realizes what's going on)

No, no, no, get off of the limb

right now. No limb.

JILLIAN

Oh, come on...she's a riot. She

sings karaoke, she has a lot of

free time, looks aren't that

important to her...

GRU

No, Jill's, that is not happening.

Seriously. I'm fine.

JILLIAN

(calling after Gru)

Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How

about my cousin Linda?

GRU

No.

JILLIAN

Oh, oh! I know someone whose

husband just died!

GRU

I'm sorry.     I did not see you

there.

GRU (CONT'D)

Or there.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT         8.

GRU

Kyle... Kyle!

GRU (CONT'D)

Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your

business on the petunias!

GRU (CONT'D)

There you go. Those are Fred's.

Go crazy.

GRU (CONT'D)

Good boy.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mr. Gru?

GRU

Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

LUCY

(holds up her badge)

Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.

(realizes her badge is

upside down)

Oh. Whoops.

(clears her throat, all

business)

Sorry, you're gonna have to come

with me.

GRU

Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!

DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT      9.

LUCY

You know you really should announce

your weapons after you fire them,

Mr. Gru. For example--

LUCY (CONT'D)

Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so

good.

LUCY

Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Oh...sorry!

LUCY (CONT'D)

Get...in...there...you...big...man!

TOM AND STUART

Boss!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   10.

TOM

Koom ey lah!

STUART

Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

STUART (CONT'D)

Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

STUART (CONT'D)

Woooo!

TOM

Ooooh!

STUART

Quack quack!

DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   11.

TOM AND STUART

Hi-YAH!!

CONFUSED FISHERMAN

What the--     Oh!

MINIONS

Whoa...

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   12.

GRU

(groggily)

Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,

foot's asleep...ah...pins and

needles...

SILAS (O.S.)

Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

GRU

Ehhh...

SILAS

I apologize for our methods in

getting you here.

LUCY

I don't. I'd do it again in a

heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I

enjoyed that. Every second of it.

Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

SILAS

That's enough, Agent Wilde.

LUCY

Sorry, sir.

GRU

Okay, this is bogus!

GRU (CONT'D)

I don't know who you people think

you are, but--

SILAS

We are the Anti-Villain League.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   13.

SILAS (CONT'D)

An ultra-secret organization

dedicated to fighting crime on a

global scale. Rob a bank? We're

not interested. Kill someone? Not

our deal. But you want to melt the

polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt.

Fuji? Or even steal the moon?

Then we notice.

GRU

First of all, you've got no proof

that I did that. Second, after I

did do that, I put it back!

SILAS

We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

That's why we've brought you here.

(beat)

I am the League's director, Silas

Ramsbottom.

TOM

Bottom.

TOM AND STUART

Heeheheeeeheeehee.

SILAS

Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

LUCY

Oh, me now...?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Um, recently an entire top secret

lab disappeared from the Arctic

Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.

Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where

did it go?

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    14.

GRU

I don't care.

LUCY

The lab was devoted to experiments

involving PX-41, a transmutation

serum. What is PX-41, you ask?

Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

TOM AND STUART

Aaah!

GRU

Oh!

GRU (CONT'D)

Hmm, you usually don't see that in

bunnies.

SILAS

As you can see, in the wrong hands,

the PX-41 serum could be the most

devastating weapon on earth.

(struggles to get through

the opening in the table)

Fortunately it has a very distinct

chemical footprint, and using the

latest chemtracking technology, we

found traces of it in the Paradise

Mall.

GRU

Ha!   A mall?

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   15.

SILAS

Precisely. And we believe that one

of these shop owners is a master

criminal.

SILAS (CONT'D)

And that's where you come in. As

an ex-villain, you know how a

villain thinks, how a villain acts.

LUCY

The plan is to set you up

undercover at a shop in the mall,

where hopefully you'll be able to--

GRU

Okay, I see where this is going,

with all the Mission Impossible

stuff, but no. No! I am a father

now. And a legitimate businessman.

I am developing a line of delicious

jams and jellies.

SILAS

Jams and...jellies?

GRU

Oh, attitude! That's right! So

thanks, but no thanks.

(beat)

And here's a tip--instead of tasing

people and kidnapping them, maybe

you should just give them a call!

Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

SILAS

Ramsbottom.

GRU

(chuckles)

Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT       16.

LUCY

Look, I probably shouldn't be

saying this, but your work as a

villain was kind of amazing, so if

you ever want to get back to doing

something awesome--give us a call.

TOM

("Stroke!")

Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!

GRU

(whispers)

Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

MARGO

Oh, sorry.

EDITH

So when ya goin' on your date?

GRU

What?

EDITH

Remember? Miss Jillian said she

was arranging a date for you.

GRU

Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And

I'm not going on any date.

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    17.

EDITH

Why not?    Are you scared?

LISA

(to her friends)

Hey, did you guys see the moon

landing on TV?

GIRLS

Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so

cool...

LISA

Yeah, and you know what--

LITTLE GRU

Excuse me, Lisa?

LISA

(to her friends)

I was talking to Billy the other

day.

GIRLS

No way.

LISA

He is so cute.

LISA (CONT'D)

And I think he likes me.

GRU

Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT   18.

GIRL

Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru

touched Lisa!

GIRLS

Eeeeewww!

RED HAIRED GIRL

Lisa's got Grooties!

GRU

Scared? Of what? Women?! No,

that's bonkers! I just-- I have no

interest in going on a date, that's

all. Case closed. I'm not scared--

of women... or dates... let's go to

bed.

GRU (CONT'D)

Goodnight, Edith.

GRU (CONT'D)

Goodnight, Margo.

GRU (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold

the horses. Who are you texting?

MARGO

No one.   Just my friend Avery.

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   19.

GRU

Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's

name or a boy's name?

MARGO

Does it matter?

GRU

No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless

it's a boy!

AGNES

I know what makes you a boy.

GRU

Uh...oooh...you...do?

AGNES

Your bald head.

GRU

Oh, yes...

AGNES

It's really smooth. Sometimes I

stare at it and imagine a little

chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

GRU

Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

SUPERVISOR MINION

Hey, oh!    Me banana!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20.

GRU

Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

GRU (CONT'D)

Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's

almost Friday.

GRU (CONT'D)

So, how's today's batch, Dr.

Nefario?

DR.    NEFARIO

I developed a    new formula which

allowed me to    get every known kind

of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

GRU

(faking it)

That tastes good...

(gags)

Love the flavor of that...

DR. NEFARIO

It's horrible, isn't it?

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    21.

GRU

No! No! Oh, we're making great

progress!

(to the Minions)

Here, try some of this.

GRU (CONT'D)

Whoa... okay, just because

everybody hates it doesn't mean

it's not good.

DR. NEFARIO

Listen, Gru. There's something

I've been meaning to talk to you

about for some time now.

GRU

What?   What's wrong?

DR. NEFARIO

(clears his throat)

I miss being evil. Sinister plots,

large-scale crimes...It's what I

live for! I mean, don't you think

there's more to our future than

jelly?

GRU

Well, I'm also considering a line

of jams...

DR. NEFARIO

Um...the thing is, Gru...

(deep breath)

I've had an offer of employment

elsewhere.

GRU

Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're

kidding, right?

DR. NEFARIO

It's a great opportunity for me,

bigger lab, more evil, full

dental...

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     22.

GRU

Very well. Let us give you the

proper send-off.

(calls off screen)

Minions!

GRU

The highest honor awarded. To Dr.

Nefario for your years of service.

The twenty-one fart gun salute!

DR. NEFARIO

Uh, I counted twenty-two.

DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)

Farewell, my friends.

DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)

This may take a while. Go about

your business.

DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)

I miss you already!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    23.

FRENCH MAID MINION

Hello?

AGNES

Are you sure we should be doing

this?

MARGO

Yes, it's for his own good.

MARGO (CONT'D)

Okay, we need to choose a picture.

AGNES

No.

AGNES (CONT'D)

Scary.

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    24.

EDITH

Weird.

GIRLS

Aaaaaah!!!

AGNES

What is that?!

GRU

Good morning, girls! I have an

announcement to make.

MARGO

Hey, what celebrity do you look

like?

GRU

Ummm...Bruce Willis.

MARGO

Mmmm...no.

AGNES

Humpty Dumpty!

EDITH

Ooh, Gollum!

GRU

Okay, what are you doing?

AGNES

We're signing you up for online

dating!

GRU

Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    25.

EDITH

Aw come on, it's fun.

MARGO

And it's time for you to get out

there.

GRU

No! Stop!      No one is ever getting

out there!     Ever!

GRU (CONT'D)

Okay, now for the announcement:    I

have accepted a new job.

MARGO

Whoa--really?

GRU

Yes, I have been recruited by a top

secret agency to go undercover and

save the world!

EDITH

You're gonna be a spy?!

GRU

That's right, baby! Gru's back in

the game! With gadgets and weapons

and cool cars...the whole deal.

EDITH

Awesome!

AGNES

Are you really gonna save the

world?

GRU

Yes.   Yes I am.

DAVE

Mocha!

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   26.

KEVIN

Cacao!

STUART

Papadam?

GRU

Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.

GRU

Alright, here is the cupcake recipe

I got off the internet.

GRU (CONT'D)

And don't go nuts with the

sprinkles!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     27.

LUCY

Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-

ay-ay-ay!

LUCY (CONT'D)

Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.

(strikes a martial arts

pose)

Or was I?

LUCY (CONT'D)

Ooh... you got... You got... a

little...

LUCY (CONT'D)

Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Oh, that's just spreading...um...

GRU

Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got

it!... Stop it!

LUCY

Oh!     I'll let you get it.

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   28.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Yeah, what you just saw there was a

little something new I've been

working on. It's a combination of

Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,

and krumping.

GRU

Okay, that's weird--why are you

here?

LUCY

On assignment from Silas.   I'm your

new partner. Yay!

GRU

What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom

didn't say anything about a

partner.

LUCY

Well, seems that because of your

checkered past, everyone else

refused to work with you. But not

me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so

I kind of have to do what they tell

me anyway.

DAVE

Walla!

LUCY

You know this guy?

GRU

Yes, he's one of my minions.

LUCY

Oh, I'm sorry. I should have

known.

LUCY (CONT'D)

You're free to go.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     29.

GRU (V.O.)

Dave...

GRU

Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.

GRU (O.S.)

Now, what do we got? Who's on the

list? Fire `em at me.

DESPICABLE ME 2               CINCO & KEN DRAFT   30.

LUCY

First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft,

proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral

Shop.

GRU

No.    Not her.

LUCY

Okay, moving on...

LUCY (CONT'D)

Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A-

Bear."

LUCY (CONT'D)

Ooh.

GRU

I don't think so.

EDUARDO (O.S.)

Hello?

GRU

Oh!

EDUARDO

Buenos dias, my friends! I am

Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &

Salsa Restaurant, across the mall.

Now open for breakfast. And you

are?

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   31.

GRU

Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are

closed.

EDUARDO

This is just gonna take un momento.

I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo

party, and I am going to need two

hundred of your best cupcakes

decorated with the Mexican flag.

It looks something like this.

EDUARDO (CONT'D)

What do you think?

GRU

Look away!

LUCY

You-- Whoa... Hooo...

EDUARDO

Anyway, I have to go. It's all

settled! I pick `em up next week!

Have a good day. Come by if you

get a chance, okay?

EDUARDO (CONT'D)

And welcome to the mall family!

GRU

(whispers)

El Macho.

LUCY

What?

GRU

But it couldn't be...

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT      32.

LUCY

Wha-- What? What couldn't be??

GRU

That guy looks exactly like a

villain named El Macho. From about

twenty years ago.

GRU (V.O.)

He was ruthless. He was dangerous.

And as the name implies, very

macho.

GRU (V.O.)

He had a reputation for pulling off

heists using only his bare hands.

GRU (V.O.)

Ah, but sadly, like all the greats,

El Macho was gone too soon.

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    33.

GRU (V.O.)

He died in the most macho way

possible.

GRU (V.O.)

Riding a shark with 250 pounds of

dynamite strapped to his chest into

the mouth of an active volcano.

GRU (V.O.)

It was glorious.

LUCY

Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty

dead...

GRU

They never found the body. Oh no.

All that was ever retrieved was a

pile of singed chest hair.

(beat)

But... that face. It has got to be

El Macho.

LUCY

Then what do you say you and I

break into his restaurant?

Tonight.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   34.

GRU

Yes, that's good, because I'm

telling you--if anybody in this

place has the PX-41 serum...

GRU (CONT'D)

...it's him.

GRU

Alright, alright, homework done,

pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for

bed.

MARGO

What's the big hurry?

GRU

I just... I have a lot of work to

do.

EDITH

Work, what kind of work?

GRU

Very important business.

So...hugs, kisses...

(hugs and kisses them)

...good night, sleep tight, don't

let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah-

blah--

AGNES

But you said you'd help me

practice my part for the Mother's

Day show!

GRU

Fine, fine... Let me hear it.

Quickly.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   35.

AGNES

(robotically)

She kisses my boo-boos

She braids my hair

My mother is beyond compare

We love you, mothers, everywhere!

GRU

Wow! That was...something else. I

really liked the way you smiled at

the end. Let's try this one more

time, but a teensy bit less like a

zombie, okay?

AGNES

Okay.

(still monotone)

She kisses my boo-boos

She braids my hair--

GRU

Perfect!   Time to go!

AGNES

I don't think I should do this.

GRU

Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

AGNES

I don't even have a mom.

GRU

Well, you don't need one to do the

show. I mean, you did the Veterans

Day Pageant and you haven't been in

combat.

AGNES

This is different.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     36.

GRU

Okay, well, then...maybe you can

just use your imagination.

AGNES

You mean I pretend I have a mom?

GRU

Yes, right. You can do that, can't

you?

AGNES

Yeah! I do that all the time!

Thanks, Gru!

MINIONS

Hey!

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    37.

GRU

Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no,

no! Hey, please!

GRU (CONT'D)

Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for

me, okay?

(points)

Dave, Stuart--come this way. With

me! Come on!

GRU (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Come on!

KEVIN

Hey, putt-putt?

JERRY

Oh!

KEVIN

Una, doo--

(laughs as he lowers the

golf club to Jerry's

head)

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     38.

KEVIN

Boca!

JERRY

(scared)

Boca!

KEVIN

Looka too!

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      39.

GRU

(whispers)

We're stealth ninjas.    We make no

sound.

LUCY

Right.   Gotcha.

GRU

Alright, El Macho, you're going

down.

LUCY

Wait!    Wait!

GRU

What?

GRU (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

LUCY

I'm checking for laser beam alarm

triggers.

GRU

It's a restaurant!

LUCY

You never know what kind of booby

traps this guy could have set.

GRU

You...know my name?

FLOYD

GRU

Well, we really should be going.

Girls, come on.

EDUARDO

That is a pity. Young love is

GRU

No!

(chuckling nervously)

You know, they're not in love.

They hardly know each other!

EDUARDO

You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!

SILAS

I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we

eliminated him as a suspect? After

the whole salsa incident?

GRU

Yes, but there has been a new

development, and I'm telling you,

this is the guy. You need to

arrest him immediately. And his

deviously charming son. I'm pretty

sure that the son is involved, too.

The son also. You've got to get

the son.

GRU (CONT'D)

(whispers)

I think that the son is the

mastermind. There's a look.

There's a devilish look in his eyes

and I don't like it!

SILAS

Yes, but I don't really see any

evidence for--

GRU

Evidence schmevidence! I go with

my gut, and my gut tells me that

this guy is El Macho! Lock him up!

Lock up the son. Don't forget

about the son. The kid gives me

No. I mean, sure, but it's not

No.   It is him!   And I will prove

death, ha, ha!

(beat)

But now it's time for me to make a

spectacular return to evil!

Doctor, I think it's time we showed

Gru what we're up to here.

GRU

Dr. Nefario?

DR. NEFARIO

Nice to see you, Gru.

GRU

Whaaat? This-- So, this is your

new job opportunity?

DR. NEFARIO

Absolutely. You're gonna like

this.

EL MACHO

Sorry--I had to borrow some of your

minions, but it was for a worthy

cause.

GRU

Oh!   Kevin? Agh!

EL MACHO

No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he

is an indestructible, mindless

killing machine!

KEVIN

Blah!

EL MACHO

Just watch this!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     83.

EL MACHO (CONT'D)

And here's the best part! I've got

an ARMY OF THEM!

EL MACHO (CONT'D)

Soon I will unleash them on the

world--and if anyone, anyone,

tries to stop them...YEOW! Their

city gets eaten!

(beat)

We can do it together!

GRU

Together?

EL MACHO

Together! I have admired your work

for years, amigo. Stealing the

moon?! Are you kidding?! We would

be unstoppable! Men like you, men

like me, we should be ruling the

world!

(excitedly)

So, are you in?

DR. NEFARIO

Woo-hoo!

GRU

Uh...yeah...probably...

DESPICABLE ME 2                  CINCO & KEN DRAFT   84.

EL MACHO

Probably?

GRU

I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes,

I just have a lot going on right

now...I just need to get some

things off my plate before we start

taking over the world, that's all.

EL MACHO

`Scuse me?

GRU

No--no, forget it! One hundred

percent! I am in!

(pretending to hear

something)

I think--what is--do you hear that--

I do. That's Agnes calling me from

on the surf--

GRU (CONT'D)

Totally in!

EL MACHO

You know what? I am not so

convinced that he is in.

KEVIN

Blah!

GRU

Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   85.

GRU (CONT'D)

Ooof!

EDITH

Sorry.

GRU

We need to go home now!    Where's

Margo?

AGNES

But I didn't get a turn!

GRU

Margo!

GRU (CONT'D)

Come on, we're leav--hey, what's

wrong?

MARGO

I hate boys.

GRU

Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,

we've got to go.

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       86.

LUCY

Oops, sorry!

EL MACHO (O.S.)

Pollito!   What's the matter?

LUCY

Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

EL MACHO

Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's

usually not like this. The same

thing happened the other day

with... with Gru and...

LUCY

Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you

seen him? I really need to talk to

him.

EL MACHO

Yes, I think he's somewhere around

here. You two are close, no?

LUCY

Oh, I don't know. I mean close...

I wouldn't say we were close. Why,

did he say we were close? Did he

say that?

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      87.

EL MACHO

It's more what he didn't say. For

instance, he never mentioned...that

you were both working for the Anti-

Villain League!!!

EL MACHO (CONT'D)

(threateningly)

You're coming with me.

LUCY

Hey!

DR. NEFARIO

Crikey.

EDITH

So Eduardo's actually El Macho?

Cool!

GRU

No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty

much knew it was him all along, so

if anyone's cool, it's me.

DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)

(whispering)

Gru!

GRU

Well, Dr. Nefario...

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    88.

DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)

(hurriedly)

El Macho's on to you. He knows

you're working for the AVL. And

he's got your partner!

GRU

Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!

She's on her way to Australia...

EL MACHO (O.S.)

Nefario!

DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)

Sorry, gotta go!

AGNES

He's got Lucy?

GRU

(determined)

Not for long.

GRU (CONT'D)

Come on.

(beat)

We're getting her out of there.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    89.

AGNES

What was that?

MARGO

I don't see anything.

DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   90.

MARGO (CONT'D)

Run!

AGNES

My unicorn!

MARGO

Agnes, no!

MARGO

C'mon!   Hurry!

AGNES

Whoa!

EDITH

What's the matter?

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   91.

AGNES

Whoa!

KEVIN

Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos?

AGNES

Kevin!

MARGO

Dr. Nefario! You're back!

DR. NEFARIO

In the flesh.

DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)

Behold, the antidote!

DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)

Come on. Let's finally put this

horrible jelly to some good use.

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   92.

GRU

Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused

here!

MINIONS

Okay, okay.

GRU

(attempting to act)

Curses. Foiled again. These guys

captured me.

GRU (CONT'D)

Run!

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      93.

GRU

Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

DR. NEFARIO

Hello, Gru!

GRU

Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

DR. NEFARIO

I put an antidote in the jelly.

(beat)

I mean, I'm happy to create an evil

army to destroy the world, but

nobody messes with my family.

GRU

Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go

get the--

DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   94.

AGNES

Hi!

GRU

You brought the girls?

DR. NEFARIO

Yes!

(beat)

Oh.     Was that wrong?

EDITH

Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

EL MACHO

Oh no! What's happening to my

minions?

(beat)

Gru?

GRU

You guys take care of the rest of

the minions.

(beat)

I'm going to find Lucy.

AGNES

Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

Waaaaah!

DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT     95.

GRU

It's over, El Macho.   Now where is

Lucy?

EL MACHO

(chuckles)

Let me show you.

LUCY

Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were

right about the whole El Macho

thing, huh?

(unconvincingly)

Yay!

EL MACHO

One push of this button and I send

that rocket straight into the same

volcano where I faked my death.

Only this time--it's for real!

GRU

(horrified)

No!

DAVE

Tally ho!

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    96.

EL MACHO

We could've ruled the world

together, Gru. But now--you're

gonna die.

GRU

Lipstick taser!

LUCY

Aw...he copied me.

EL MACHO

(dazed)

I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

DR. NEFARIO

Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,

sunshine.

DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     97.

LUCY

Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be

fine. I have survived lots worse

than this.

(beat)

Okay, that's not entirely true.

I'm actually kind of freaking out

up here!

GRU

Don't worry--I will get you out of

this!

GRU (CONT'D)

I really hate that chicken.

LUCY

Is there a red one?   It's usually

the red one.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Gru, anytime now!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    98.

GRU

Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of

this alive, so I need to ask you a

question.

LUCY

Uh, better make it quick!

GRU

If I'd asked you out on a date,

what would you have said?

LUCY

Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

GRU

JUMP!!!

GRU (CONT'D)

Oh!  Lucy!

(looks around, panicking)

Lucy! Where are you?!

GRU (CONT'D)

Oh, Lucy!

LUCY

Gru!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      99.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Sorry...I guess you kind of need

your arms to tread water, huh?

TOM

("Stroke!")

Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

GRU

They'll be back...

EDITH

Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

AGNES

Okay.

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    100.

AGNES (CONT'D)

Excuse me!

AGNES (CONT'D)

Um...hi!   Excuse me!

AGNES (CONT'D)

Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to

make some toast. Uh...

AGNES (CONT'D)

She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.

She braids my hair.

We love you mothers, everywhere!

AGNES (CONT'D)

And my new mom Lucy is beyond

compare.

AGNES (CONT'D)

To the bride and Gru!

AGNES (CONT'D)

I'M SO HAAAAPPPPYYYYYYY!!!!

DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    101.

Blaaaaah!
