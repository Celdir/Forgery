TRACY (VO)

None of this would have happened if Mr.

McAllister hadn't meddled the way he

did.  He should have just accepted

things as they are instead of trying to

interfere with destiny.  You see, you

can't interfere with destiny.  That's

why it's destiny.  And if you try to

interfere, the same thing's going to

happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.

JIM

Morning, Lowell

JIM

Twenty-one... twenty-two.

MOTHER

(distant)

Good luck!

TRACY

Good morning, Mr. McAllister.

JIM

Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?

TRACY

(chirping)

You know what they say about the early

bird.

JIM

Yes, I do.

JIM

Well, good luck there, Tracy

TRACY

Thanks, Mr. M.

TRACY (VO)

No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister

had it out for me from the start.  Oh

sure, he was all smiles and good wishes

and everything, but underneath he was

just as unfair and petty as anybody

else.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

He'll probably tell you how committed

he was to teaching and democracy and

integrity and all. Don't be fooled.

JIM (VO)

It's hard to remember how the whole

thing started, the whole election mess.

What I do remember is that I loved my

job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I

couldn't imagine doing anything else.

VOICE (OS)

Hey, Mr. M. Mr. M.!

PAUL

Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!

JIM (VO)

The students knew it wasn't just a job

for me.

JIM

C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's

hold 'em back!

JIM (VO)

I got involved. And I cared.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

And I think I made a difference.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

I knew I touched the students' lives

during their difficult young adult

years, and I took that responsibility

seriously.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

In the twelve years I taught U.S.

History, Civics and current Events at

Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year

three times - a school record.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Standing in front of a room full of

young people, trying to make them think

that's how I wanted to spend the rest

of my life,

JIM

So would this be an ethical situation

or a moral situation? What's the

difference between ethics and morals,

anyway?

JIM (CONT'D)

Anybody

JIM (CONT'D)

Derek

DEREK

Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do

what society tells you is right and

morals are like, uh...

JIM

You're on the right track,  who can

help him out?

DEREK

..morals are when...

JIM

Michelle?

MICHELLE

Morals are like lessons, you know, like

the moral of a story; it's what you

learn from a story or a fable or

something. . .

JIM

Or a life experience.  Good.  And

ethics?

MICHELLE

That's more like, urn... Ethics is how

you use the morals... that you learn

from a story?

JIM

Okay.  But we're still missing

something key here.  What are we

missing?

TRACY

(hand still raised)

I know.

JIM

(finally)

Tracy.

TRACY

Ethics are...

JIM (VO)

Tracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never

met anyone quite like Tracy Flick.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

She first showed up in my life as a

freshman delegate in student council.

I'd seen a lot of ambitious students

come and go over the years, but I could

tell right away Tracy Flick was

different.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

It wasn't long before everyone knew who

Tracy Flick was.  She made sure of that.

Her drive was astonishing.  Even scary.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

Some people say I'm an overachiever,

but I think they're just jealous.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

My Mom always tells me I'm different --

you know, special. And if you look at

all the things I've accomplished so far,

I think you'd have to agree.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

Here I am in Oklahoma.

TRACY

(off-key)

I'm just a girl who can't say no...

TRACY (VO)

And here I am on KMHS, our student-run

TV station.

TRACY (ON TV)

..that's why Principal Hendricks made

the controversial announcement that the

littering must stop.  Tracy Flick

reporting.

TRACY (VO)

But it was in SGA, the Student

Government Association, where I made my

biggest mark.  I never missed a meeting,

and I volunteered for every committee as

long as I could lead it.

TRACY

I agree with Ashley.  We should rent

the barrels at least a day beforehand.

What happened last time was a travesty,

I mean, we were --

LARRY FOUCH

(trying to quiet

her)

Yeah, no, I know, Tracy.  That's why

we're -- Look, can we just take a vote

on this?

JIM (VO)

Now at the end of her junior year,

Tracy was poised to win the presidency

of the student body.  And so far she was

running unopposed.

TRACY

...the rules of conduct determined by a

culture at a...

JIM (VO)

Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy

I think you should know.

DAVE

Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe

it.

JIM (VO)

A few months before the election, she'd

had an affair with my best friend Dave

Novotny.

JIM

Don't tell me that.  I don't want to

know that.

DAVE

She's incredible.  Everything just gets

soaked.

JIM (VO)

Dave came to Millard the year after I

did, and we hit it off right away. We

backed each other up in teachers'

meetings and shared an interest in 60's

music and micro-breweries.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

You could tell Dave was one of those

guys who taught because they never

wanted to leave high school in the first

place, and that could get a little

irritating sometimes, but basically he

was a real good guy.

DAVE

(singing)

Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a

cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You

know you're a sweet little love maker...

JIM (VO)

Our wives became best friends too. And

when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was

born, they asked us to be godparents.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

YOU probably think the worst - that Mr.

Novotny was just taking advantage of one

of his students, but it wasn't like that

at all. Our relationship was based on

mutual respect and admiration. I mean,

during my sophomore year in geometry it

was strictly professional between us --

I mean, nothing.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

It wasn't until junior year when we

worked together on the yearbook that

things got serious.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

One night he took us editors out to

celebrate after a deadline. Eventually

Dave and I were left alone and we got to

talking - not like teacher and student,

but like two adults.

DAVE

You know, Tracy... I don't know how to

say this, but...

TRACY

what?

DAVE

Well, I notice you don't seem to have

any close friends at Millard. You seem

to be kind of a loner.

TRACY

No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.

DAVE

I know.  I know its not by choice.  I

just mean, well, being the kind of

person you are, it must be really

difficult to find someone you can talk

to.

TRACY

What do you mean? What kind of person

am I?

DAVE

What kind of person?

DAVE (CONT'D)

Tracy, I've been watching you for going

on two years now, and I think you are

one of the most talented, hard-working,

sensitive, attractive, brilliant

students -- no, human beings -- I have

ever met.  I mean, you're the real

thing.  Special.

TRACY

(embarrassed, low)

Thank you.

DAVE

And I know sometimes people like you

have to pay a price for their greatness,

and that price is loneliness.

DAVE (CONT'D)

I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it

seems like you might need a friend.

TRACY (VO)

Since I grew up without a dad, you

might assume psychologically I was

looking for a father figure.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

But that had nothing to do with it at

all.  It was just that Dave was so

strong and made me feel so safe and

protected.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

It was the first time somebody ever saw

the real me, the me that nobody else

knows.

DAVE

(looking around)

Here, get down.

DAVE

Look at you.

TRACY (VO)

When I think back on my relationship

with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is

our talks.

JIM

You did it at your house?  Your own

house?

DAVE

Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all

seems crazy, and maybe it did start out,

you know, for the... for the sex and the

danger.  But now it's different.  Jim,

what I'm trying to tell you is that

Tracy and I are totally, totally in

love.

JIM

In love?

DAVE

Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she

inspires me in ways Sherry never has.

She even wants to read my novel.

JIM

But you haven't written your novel.

DAVE

That's the whole point. It's all in my

head; it's right here.  I just got to

get it out there. Tracy wants me to

write it so she can read it.  It's

beautiful.

JIM

Dave, I'm just saying this as your

friend.  What you're doing is really,

really wrong, and you've got to stop.

DAVE

You're not just jealous, are you?  I

mean, we both used to talk about her

JIM

(exploding)

That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What

are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all

the time, but it doesn't mean anything.

I would never. . . I mean, I take very

seriously our strict moral code.  The

line you've crossed is... it's illegal

and it's immoral.

DAVE

I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim,

okay?  I know what --

JIM

I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm

talking about morals.

SHERRY (OS)

Peek-a-boo!

DAVE

(to Jim,

whispering)

Look, I appreciate your concern. I

really do.  But like I said, I got it

under control.

JIM (VO)

I guess I don't have to tell you how

all this turned out.

DAVE

Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.

WALT

No, I'd say she doesn't.  I don't think

I've ever seen a mother quite so upset.

We're all very, very lucky she doesn't

want this public.

DAVE

But we're in love

WALT

Dave. Dave, look at me

WALT

I want you to get some help.

DAVE & SHERRY'S LIVING ROOM	NIGHT

JIM (VO)

After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him

out of the house and filed for divorce.

SHERRY

Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?

DAVE

Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...

JIM (VO)

He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to

live with his parents. I haven't heard

from him in a long time. Poor guy. I

warned him.

TRACY

...certain time in history and

JIM

Okay.  We'll pick up here next time

TRACY (VO)

Now that I have more life experience, I

feel sorry for Mr. McAllister.

TRACY (VO)

I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same

little room saying the exact same things

year after year for his whole life,

wearing the same stupid clothes, while

his students go on to good colleges and

move to big cities and do great things

and make loads of money has got to be at

least a little jealous.  It's like my

room says - the weak always try to

sabotage the strong.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

One thing that's important to know

about me is that I'm an only child.  So

my Mom is really devoted to me, and I

love her so much.  She wants me to do

all the things she wanted to do in life

but couldn't.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

See, Mom used to be a stewardess for

Northwest and now works as a para-legal.

She likes to write letters to successful

women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole

and ask them how they got to be where

they are and what advice do they have

for me, Tracy, her daughter.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

Nine times out of ten they say you have

to hold on to your dreams no matter

what.  The pressures women face mean you

have to work twice as hard, and you

can't let anything or anyone stand in

your way.

TRACY

One per person!  Put those back I

DOUG SCHENKEN

Eat me

TRACY

Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight.

TRACY (VO)

But you know,  winning isn't

everything.  If you play fair and follow

all the rules thoroughly, you'll always

come out ahead.  Win or lose, ethical

conduct is the most important thing.

Just ask Mr. McAllister.

TRACY

Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up

I

TRACY

I got all my signatures.  One hundred

and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!

JIM

Hey, that's super

TRACY

Here they are.

JIM

You can put those in my box.  I'll look

at them tomorrow.

TRACY

Could you approve them now?  I'd like

to kick off my campaign right away, you

know, in the morning.

JIM

(resigned)

Right

JIM (CONT'D)

Looks good to me.

TRACY

Aren't you supposed to keep them?

JIM

NO, that's fine

TRACY

I thought you were supposed to keep

them.

JIM

Okay, fine. Sure

TRACY

Thanks for everything.

JIM

You bet.

TRACY

(cheery, awkward)

I can't wait to start campaigning.

JIM

Should be easy.  So far no competition.

TRACY

Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's

number one soft drink, but they spend

more money than anybody on advertising.

I guess that's how come they stay number

one.

JIM

Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy

TRACY

You know, Mr. M., when I win the

presidency, that means you and I are

going to be spending a lot of time

together next year.  And I for one would

like that time to be harmonious and

productive. Wouldn't you?

JIM

Sure

TRACY

Okay. That's good. I just wanted to

make sure.

JIM

Good luck, Tracy.

JIM (VO)

I don't blame Tracy for what happened

with Dave. How could I? Dave was an

adult more than twice her age.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Sure, she got on my nerves once in a

while, but I admired Tracy. I really

did.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Thank God for Diane.  She was my best

friend, my source of love and strength.

Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy

times, but we'd always seen them

through.  After nine years of marriage,

we were closer than ever.  And the

secret? Good communication.

DIANE

Anything wrong?

JIM

Everything's fine.  Just, you know,

school.

TRACY'S VOICE

...You know, Coca-Cola's by far the

number one soft drink... When I win the

presidency we're going to be spending a

lot of time together... a lot of time...

lots and lots and lots of time...

president and advisor. . .

TRACY

...harmonious and productive... close

and special... you and I...  so close...

so intimate... together...

JIM

(quietly)

Paul.

PAUL

Why. . . ? Why. . . ?

PAUL (VO)

I was so mad at God when I broke my leg

at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

The doctors told me I'd have to quit

sports for at least a couple years if

not forever.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

...which meant no first-string

quarterback in the fall. It was like the

end of my life!

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

When I got back to school everybody was

so supportive, and they all wanted to

sign my cast and everything...

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

... but I still couldn't shake the

feeling that now my life had no purpose.

What did God want from me?

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

Why did I exist?

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

Sometimes you can search everywhere for

answers. Then one day destiny just taps

you on the shoulder. I know, because it

happened to me.

JIM

Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?

PAUL (VO)

Mr. McAllister changed my life. And no

matter what they say he did or did not

do, I believe he is a good man.

JIM

Paul, I know you've been pretty down

since your accident.

PAUL

I wanted to play next year so bad I

could taste it.  And maybe go on to...

JIM

I know.  I understand disappointment.

I really do.

PAUL

Yeah.

JIM

But you've got a big choice right now.

You can choose to be depressed about it

for the rest of your life. Or you can

choose to see it for what it really is:

an opportunity.  I personally think you

have a big future ahead of you, and I

don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.

PAUL

What do you mean?

JIM

Let me give you a clue.  You're a born

leader.  You're one of the most popular

students at Millard.  You're honest and

straightforward.  You don't choke under

pressure, as we all saw in that amazing

fourth quarter against Westside.  The

other kids look up to you.  What does

that spell?

JIM

Student... council... president.

PAUL

Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't

know anything about that stuff, Mr. M.

Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing.

She's always working so hard and --

JIM

Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.

PAUL

And she's super-nice

JIM

Yeah.  But one person assured of

victory kind of undermines the whole

idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's

more like a... well, like a

dictatorship, like we studied.

JIM

Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

PAUL

Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears

JIM

takes a piece of chalk from the lip of

the blackboard.

JIM

Okay, let's say

PAUL

No, wait -- apples.  Apples.

JIM

Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was

apples.  Apples, apples and more apples.

You might think apples were pretty good,

even if you occasionally got a rotten

one. Then one day there's an orange. And

now you can make a decision. Do you want

an apple, or do you want an orange?

That's democracy.

PAUL

I also like bananas.

JIM

Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe

it's time to give a little something

back.

TRACY

The right side is too high. The right

side. Just a smidge.

GUY

(signing)

Hey Paul, you going over to Anthony's

on Friday, or what did you decide?

PAUL

I gotta talk to him first.

TRACY

Who put you up to this?

PAUL

Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy

TRACY

Who put you up to this?

PAUL

What do you mean?

TRACY

You just woke up this morning and

suddenly decided to run for president?

PAUL

No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just

thought --

TRACY

Thought what?

PAUL

Well, see, I was talking to Mr.

McAllister about my leg and

everything... and how I still want to,

you know, do something for the school

and --

TRACY

So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.

PAUL

Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him

and everything, but he just said he

thought it was a good idea... and how

there's all different kinds of fruit

and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy.

You're the best.  I just thought --

TRACY

Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.

TRACY (VO)

You might think it upset me that Paul

Metzier had decided to run against me,

but nothing could be further from the

truth.  He was no competition for me: it

was like apples and oranges. It just

meant I had to work a little harder,

that's all.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

You see, I believe in the voters. They

understand that elections aren't just

popularity contests. They know this

country was built by people just like me

who work very hard and don't have

everything handed to them on a silver

spoon.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

Not like some rich kids who everybody

likes because their fathers own Metzier

Cement and give them trucks on their

sixteenth birthday and throw them big

parties all the time.  They don't ever

have to work for anything.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

They think they can all of a sudden one

day out of the blue waltz right in with

no qualifications whatsoever and try to

take away what other people have worked

for very, very hard their entire lives.

No, it didn't bother me at all I

PAUL

Paul... Paul... power... Paul... Paul

for President... progress... promise...

peanut... Paul-i-tics... yeah...

President Paul... Punt for Paul!  No.

TAMMY

(softly)

What?

LISA

I told you ... I can't. I just -- It

doesn't feel right anymore, you know?

TAMMY

If you could just get out of your head.

LISA

I said no!

PAUL

Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.

TAMMY

Don't you fucking knock?

PAUL

Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr.

McAllister, he --

(noticing Lisa)

Oh hi. Lisa.

TAMMY

Paul, get out!

PAUL

So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --

LISA

I gotta go.

TAMMY

(to Paul)

You dumbshit!

PAUL

What'd I do?

TAMMY (VO)

You know how they say one day a big

meteor might come and crash into the

Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think

that would be a good thing.

TAMMY

Lisa

TAMMY

Stop! Wait!

TAMMY (CONT'D)

Where 're you going?

LISA

I'm not like you.

TAMMY

What...?

LISA

I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in

love. We were just... I was just

experimenting.

TAMMY (VO)

How can something that seems so true

turn out to be such a lie?

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

I mean Lisa and I were destined to be

together. It was so obvious. Of all the

people on the planet who had ever lived,

somehow we'd found each other.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

Lisa...

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

I remember one time Lisa and I did an

experiment with asparagus to see how

long it takes your pee to smell. We peed

a little every five minutes.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

For her it took about fifteen minutes,

and for me it was twenty.

TAMMY (VO)

Everyday I found some new way to tell

Lisa I loved her.

NOTE

(Tammy's voice)

If you died right now, I would throw

myself into one of my Dad's cement

trucks and get poured into your tomb.

TAMMY (VO)

But it just seemed like the closer we

got, the more she pulled away.

LISA

Are you crazy?

TAMMY

What?

LISA

People can see this.

TAMMY

So?

LISA

These are private -- these are for us.

TAMMY

I know.

LISA

But other people can see them too.

TAMMY

I don't care.

LISA

Well, I do.

TAMMY (VO)

What did I do to make her change?

What's wrong with me?

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

(a whisper)

Lisa.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

Sometimes when I'm sad, I sit and watch

the power station.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

They say if you lie between two of the

main wires, your body just evaporates.

You become a gas.  I wonder what that

would feel like.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

I don ' t know what I did to make Lisa

hate me so much, but somehow she decided

to hurt roe. And she knew exactly what

to do.

PAUL (VO)

I sure was surprised the day Lisa

Flanagan asked me for a ride home and

ended up blowing me.

LISA

I've wanted this for so long.

PAUL

Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.

LISA

Sorry.

PAUL (VO)

Life is so weird.  First Lisa has a big

fight with my sister, and the next thing

you know she's my girlfriend.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

Since Lisa knew all about public

relations and stuff, she offered to help

me with my campaign.  We made a great

team!

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

It seemed so natural, the two of us

together.  It was like destiny.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

That spring was perfect.  My leg wasn't

bugging me too much, and the weather was

so nice.  And every afternoon after

school. Lisa and I would go to her house

to fuck and have a swim.  It was like we

were in a world all our own.

TAMMY (VO)

I had to do something.  I didn't know

what, but I had to do something.

JIM (VO)

Around that time Diane and I were

hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's

house, giving her our love and support

and helping her make it through a

difficult time.

DIANE

Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.

JIM

He likes it.

DIANE

Here.  Give him to me.

(as she takes

Darryl)

is little Darryl dizzy?  That's it. .

come here. . .

SHERRY

You got him?

DIANE

Yeah.

JIM (VO)

Diane really wanted to have kids -- and

so did I -- but it seemed like there was

always a reason to wait: she had to

finish nursing school, I had to get my

masters, we needed a new house, we

needed more money.  Finally we just

decided to go for it...

JIM (VO)

...but for over a year we hadn't had

any luck.  And Diane was getting

desperate.

DIANE

You gonna do it? You gonna do it?

JIM

Yeah, uh, just a minute

DIANE

Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come

on, fill me up

JIM

Yeah, just --

DIANE

Do it!

DIANE (CONT'D)

Okay!

DIANE

Could you hand me the remote?

SHERRY

Say, Jim. Jim.

SHERRY (CONT'D)

Could you get this? I can't

JIM

Sure.

JIM (VO)

Without Dave around. Sherry needed a

lot of help around the house.

JIM

Here?

SHERRY

(indicating)

More this way.

JIM

Okay.  Give me the drill.

JIM

I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never

had a chance to spend any time alone

together.  How with Dave out of the

picture, I began to see what an

incredibly sensitive and giving person

she was.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Plus she had finally dropped all that

weight from her pregnancy, and really

she looked great.

JIM (VO)

We got to be pretty good buddies.  I

even took her to the mall one time while

her car was in the shop.

SHERRY

What do you think?

JIM

You look great

SHERRY

I can't afford this stuff right now.

JIM

Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year,

you're cooped up with the kid all the

time.  Let go; live a little.

SHERRY

You sure?

JIM

So what do you think?  Should we get a

room?

SHERRY

Should we get a what?

JIM

points at the motel.

SHERRY (CONT'D)

Oh.

SHERRY (CONT'D)

(stiffly)

That's not funny.

DIANE

How'd it go?

JIM

Fine. You know. We just went to

Crossroads.

DIANE

You guys have fun?

JIM

(between bites)

Yeah. No. I mean, you know.

DIANE

What?

JIM

Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a

little much sometimes.

DIANE

Oh, Jim! Oh, God!

DIANE/SHERRY

Oh, God.  Just like that.  Oh yes. Fill

me up...

DIANE/TRACY

Do it, Jim.  Fuck me.

TRACY (OS)

Fuck me, Mr. McAllister

JIM (VO)

So like I was saying, things were going

pretty well in my life.

JIM (VO)

... that is, until things started going

all haywire with that damn election.

PAUL

Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?

TRACY

You're the advisor.  You should stop

her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a

sophomore.

JIM

Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.

TRACY

Are you sure all her signatures are

real?  It's not easy to get all those

signatures.

JIM

As far as I know, they--

PAUL

We can't both run, can we?  We're

brother and sister.  Can we?

LISA

It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul

was first.

JIM

Anyone who gets signatures in on time

can run.  And she got in just under the

wire.  Nothing I can do.

TRACY

Let me see them.  Let me see them

TRACY

These are a bunch of burn-outs. And

look at this one, I can't even read this

one.

JIM

(taking the sheet)

Looks like Tim Kobza.

LISA

She's doing this to get back at me

PAUL

For what?

LISA

I mean at you.

PAUL

For what?

LISA

I don't know.  You're her brother you

should know.

TRACY

Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've

never heard of him!

JIM

Look, why don't we just forget about

Tammy?  We'll have the assembly

tomorrow, everybody'll make their

speeches, and I'm sure everything will

be fine.

JERRY

I love Millard High, and I will be a

dedicated vice President. A vote for

Jerry Slavin is a vote for good

government. And even if I can't really

stand up for you, I will.

(cracks himself up)

Thank you.

JIM

Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again,

Jerry is running unopposed for Vice

President. So we'll move on now to the

presidential race with three candidates

running. The first in alphabetical order

is Tracy Flick.

TRACY

Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I

cannot make my days longer, so I strive

to make them better."  With this

election, we here at Millard also have

an opportunity to make our high school

days better.  During this campaign I

have had the opportunity to speak with

many of you about your concerns.  I

spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who

told me how alienated she feels from her

own homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore

Reggie Banks, who said his mother works

in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy

him enough spiral notebooks for his

classes.  I won't bore you with long-

winded promises about all the new and

innovative things I will definitely

achieve during the year in which it will

be my honor and privilege to represent

each and every one of you, but I can say

that my years of experience on the

student council have taught me the three

most important attributes the president

needs to possess;  commitment -

DOUG SCHENKEN

Eat me

DOUG'S BUDDY

Eat me raw!

WALT

If you can't be adults and give these

candidates the courtesy they deserve,

then you don't deserve to be called

adults but children* Because that's what

children are. And you'll be treated like

children. So let's all listen up.

TRACY

The three most important attributes the

president needs to possess are:

commitment, qualifications, and

experience.  I'll add one more; caring.

I care about Millard, and I care about

each and every one of you, and together

we can all make a difference.  One of

the things I would like to establish is

a regular open forum where any student

can come and voice their concern about

issues we face here at Millard.  I and

the rest of the student council would

then interface with the faculty and

staff, so a continuous dialogue would

exist.

WALT

I'd say she knows a thing or two about

student-faculty dialogue.

TRACY

When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick

next week, you won't just be voting for

me.  You'll be voting for yourself and

for every other student Our days won't

be any longer, but they can sure be

better.  Thank you.

JIM

The next candidate for student body

president is Paul Metzier.  Paul?

PAUL

As many of you know I broke my leg

pretty bad thi3 year and the experience

has made me reevaluate what I want to do

with my life and that is help people

when you think about it a school is more

than a school it's our second home where

we spend all cur time and grow as

individuals and a community but is our

school everything it could be I want our

school to reach its true potential that

is why I am running for president.

PAUL

I know what it is to fight hard and win

like when we almost went to state last

fall and I threw that fourth-quarter

pass against Westside for the touchdown

that won the game by three points I

won't let you down like I didn't then I

promise we can all score a winning

(big breath)

touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier

for president thank you.

JIM

Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for

President - another one of the Metzier

clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.

WALT

People.  People I

TAMMY

Who cares about this stupid election?

TAMMY (CONT'D)

We all know it doesn't matter who gets

elected president of Millard. You think

it's going to change anything around

here, make one single person happier or

smarter or nicer? The only person it

matters to is the one who gets elected.

The same pathetic charade happens every

year, and everyone makes the same

pathetic promises just so they can put

it on their transcripts to get into

college.  So vote for me, because I

don't even want to go to college, and I

don't care, and as president I won't do

anything.  The only promise I make is

that if elected I will immediately

dismantle the student government, so

that none of us will ever have to sit

through one of these stupid assemblies

again!

STUDENTS

Tammy!   Tammy!  Tammy!

TAMMY

0h don't vote for me I  Who cares?

Don't vote at all!

WALT

That little bitch made a fool of us I

want her out of the election. Getting

everybody all riled up like that.  She's

finished, you hear me? Washed up.

JIM

Walt, we can't throw her out of the

election just because we don't like her

speech.  That's not what student

government's about.

WALT

(grumbling)

Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's

a troublemaker.  She's on my list.

RON

All we need to do is send a message, so

maybe we should just suspend her.

WALT

Right.  That's it.  She's suspended for

a week!

JIM

I think that's a little strong Walt.

Ron?

RON

We don't want to make a martyr out of

her.  Three days sounds right to me.

WALT

Okay.  Three days.  Take care of it.

TAMMY (VO)

Being suspended is like getting a paid

vacation.  Too bad it was only three

days

DUDE

Here you go.

TAMMY

Hey -- I said lights I

TAMMY

What do you want?

PAUL

Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know,

I went to all your teachers and got your

assignments.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I just thought, well, last time you got

suspended you fell so behind and -

TAMMY

Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.

TAMMY (CONT'D)

Now could you leave me alone?

PAUL

Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You

know, all this election stuff. 'Cause,

you know, everyone is saying it's so

weird that you're running against me,

and, well, it is kind of weird, and you

haven't really told me why you're doing

it and didn't tell me in advance or

anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l

respect your privacy.  I just want you

to know that no matter who wins, if it's

you or me, there's no hard feelings.

We're still brother and sister.  Okay?

Cause... and I hope you feel the same.

TAMMY

Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.

PAUL

Okay.  Great.  I feel good.

PAUL

Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Right.  One other

thing.  Since you know Lisa so well,

could you give me some advice?  I want

to get her something for helping me with

the election.  You know, something

really special -- like flowers or candy

or flowers and candy.  Or is that too

typical?  I mean, can you think of

something? Something really special?

You know, something she'd really like?

TRACY (VO)

What happened at the speeches was an

unconscienceable travesty. That little

bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a

fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to

work. People do care who wins. Things do

matter.

TRACY

Eric, the "r" is supposed to be green,

not blue.

ERIC

Oh. Okay.

ERIC (CONT'D)

So, Tracy, I was wondering if after we

finish with these you'd like to go to a

movie or something.

TRACY

That's okay.  I'm too busy.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

People are so ungrateful.  If all those

students who cheered for Tammy Metzier

only knew how hard I worked for Millard.

Like all the late nights I spent at the

yearbook office just to give them their

memories.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

One of my duties was to clean up the

group photos.  It was a cinch with our

new software.

TRACY

(under her breath)

Let's see... "save" is Command "S."

Okay.

TRACY

I didn't do this.  I didn't do it.

JIM

There's your culprit

JIM (CONT'D)

Shall we give it a name?

SHERRY

(not missing a

beat)

Dave.

SHERRY

Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?

JIM

No, I... uh, didn't know that

SHERRY

All his life.  He's tried everything.

JIM

(about the shower)

Still clear?

SHERRY

Yep.

JIM

We'll let it run awhile

SHERRY

This one's clean.

SHERRY (CONT'D)

I guess you'd better get to work huh?

You're going to be late.

SHERRY (CONT'D)

Thank you, Jim.

SHERRY

Hey Yeah?

SHERRY

Take me to that motel.  Like you

wanted.

JIM

Right now?

SHERRY

Easy, tiger.  Come by after school.

I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.

JIM

Three twenty-five.

SHERRY

Three twenty-five.

JIM (VO)

What had blossomed between Sherry and

me was too real, too powerful to deny.

For the first time in years, I felt free

and alive!

JIM (VO CONT'D)

So as you can imagine, my thoughts

weren't on the election that Monday

morning.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how

perfect she felt inside. There was a

special poem I wanted to read to her

later, at the motel, as she lay next to

me.

VOICE (OS)

Mr. McAllister to the Principal's

Office.  Mr. McAllister to the

Principal's office.

LISA

It's not fair.  It's not fair

PAUL

I just don't think anybody would do

something like that on purpose.  It must

have been some kind of mistake. Like a

maintenance thing.

WALT

Jim, where the hell have you been?

JIM

Nowhere.  I don't have class until

second period.

WALT

Even tried you at home.  We've got a

situation here.

LISA

If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair.

There has to be another election,  with

posters.

JIM

What's the problem?

LISA

Didn't you see?

WALT

Somebody tore down their posters.

LISA

Those posters cost a lot of money we

don't have I  There's no time to make

any more posters, there's no --

WALT

We'll get to the bottom of it.

PAUL

(to Lisa)

We still have some extra ones, don't

we?  Maybe we can just --

LISA

It was Tammy I  That's who it was.

PAUL

Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy

wouldn't... she...

WALT

Well, that speech she gave -- it was

pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But

we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't

you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to

see to that.  Right, Jim?

JIM

(his thoughts

elsewhere)

Oh yeah, you bet.

LISA

She should be expelled.  Or worse!

WALT

You two just go back and focus on your

studies.  Mr. McAllister's going to

handle this.

MR. BECKMAN

Tracy?

TRACY (VO)

When I arrived at school that morning,

I was shocked to find that one of my key

banners had been removed by vandals. I

noticed that a few of my rival's posters

had also been tampered with. Of course,

I was outraged, but one day before the

election is not the time to lose your

head over a couple of posters. When

you're in the public eye, attacks like

that just come with the territory.

JIM

Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door

behind you.

JIM

I guess you know why you're here

TRACY

If it's about the posters, I think it's

so awful. It's a travesty.

JIM

A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting,

because I think you did it.

TRACY

Wait - are you accusing me? You're not

serious.

(indignant)

I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have

worked together on SGA for three solid

years and... I mean, I can't believe it.

I'm... I'm shocked!

TRACY (CONT'D)

Mr. M., I am running on my

qualifications.  I would never need to

resort to, you know, to vandalism like

a, you know... Plus, my own best banner

was torn down.  Did I do that too?

JIM

Were you or were you not working in the

Watchdog office over the weekend?

TRACY

I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in.

As you know, with all my

responsibilities I often come in on the

weekend and have permission to do so.

But I left very early, around 6:30.

JIM

6:30.  How do you know what time the

posters were torn down?

TRACY

I don't.  I just know they were there

when I left.  I'm giving you helpful

information is all.  You know, instead

of wasting time interrogating me, we

should be out there trying to find out

who did this.

JIM

Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did

it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"

TRACY

well, I don't know.  It could have been

anybody.  There are a lot of, you know,

subversive elements around Millard.  You

know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck

and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken -

what about him?  Or what about Tammy

Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti-

this and anti-that.

JIM

You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy.

You have many admirable qualities.  But

someday maybe you'll learn that being

smart and always being on top and doing

whatever you need to do to get ahead,

and yes, stepping on people to get

there, well, there's a lot more to life

than that.  And in the end, you're only

cheating yourself.

TRACY

Why are you lecturing me?

JIM

This isn't the time or the place to get

into it, but there is, for just one

example, a certain former colleague of

mine, who made a very big mistake, a

life mistake.  I think the lesson there

is that, old and young, we ail make

mistakes, and we have to learn that our

actions, all of them, can carry serious

consequences.  You're very young, Tracy

underage, in fact -- but maybe one

day you'll understand.

TRACY

I don't know what you're referring to,

but I do know that if certain older and

wiser people hadn't acted like such

little babies and gotten all mushy,

everything would be okay.

JIM

I agree.  But I also think certain

young and naive people need to thank

their lucky stars and be very, very

grateful the whole school didn't find

out about certain indiscretions which

could have ruined their reputations, and

chances to win certain elections.

TRACY

And I think certain older persons like

you and your "colleague" shouldn't be

leaching after their students,

especially when some of them can't even

get their own wives pregnant.  And they

certainly shouldn't be running around

making slanderous accusations.

Especially when certain young, naive

people's mothers are para-legal

secretaries at the city's biggest law

firm and have won many successful

lawsuits. And if you want to keep

questioning me like this, I won't

continue without my attorney present.

JIM

Okay, Tracy.  Have it your way.

TAMMY

You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?

JIM

Just wait outside. Tammy.

TAMMY

Okay.  But is this about the posters?

JIM

Possibly.  Please just wait outside.

TAMMY

Okay.

(looking at Tracy)

Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll

just be outside.

JIM

Tracy, don't go away.  Come in, Tammy.

TRACY

This ought to be good

JIM

So... what do you have to tell me?

TAMMY

Well, this is hard for me, but I think

it's important to be honest. Don't you?

JIM

(impatient)

What is it. Tammy?

TAMMY

I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down

Paul's posters.

JIM

Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a

word.

TAMMY (CONT'D)

I did it.

JIM

And when did you do it?

TAMMY

This weekend.

JIM

Exactly when?

TAMMY

I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.

JIM

And how did you get in the school?

TAMMY

Door was open.

JIM

Which door?

TAMMY

I don't know. All I know is I did it I

JIM

I don't believe you.

TAMMY

I have proof.

TAMMY

You don't know what it's like to grow

up in the shadow of an older brother

like Paul.  it's always Paul, Paul,

Paul, Paul.  Never Tammy.  I'm only

Paul's little sister.  You must be

and I'm so troubled.  I hate him!  I

hate him!  And I tore down his posters,

It was a horrible, cowardly act, but I

did it,.. I did it... l did it... And

I'm not sorry...

JIM

Final  I don't know what your problem

is, but if that's the way you want it,

that's the way it'll be.  I don't have

time.  You're out of the election, and

I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks.

JIM (CONT'D)

Tracy?

TRACY

Yes?

JIM

Looks like today's your lucky day

TRACY

What do you mean?

JIM

You're off the hook. Tammy here has

confessed.

TRACY

I told you!  I told you!

(pointing at Tammy)

You're going to pay for my banner!

JIM

That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while

you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.

(to Hiss Seeder)

Could you ask Walt to come in?

JIM (VO)

The rest of the day was unbearable.  I

kept smelling Sherry on my clothes and

on my fingers and I just couldn't wait

to get out of there.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

I wanted everything to be perfect that

afternoon, so I decided to give myself a

little time to prepare during eighth

period.

JIM

Pop quiz, everybody

JIM (CONT'D)

No whining.  If you've done your

reading, this is an easy one.

JIM (VO)

I'd have exactly forty-eight minutes to

make all the arrangements.

JIM

If you finish early, just sit quietly

and check your work.  I'll be right

back.

JIM

Okay, everybody, pass them forward.

Stephanie, put down your pen.

JIM (CONT'D)

I'll see you all on Wednesday. And

don't forget to vote tomorrow.

JIM

Sherry I

JIM (CONT'D)

Sherry I It's Jim!

JIM

Sherry

JIM (CONT'D)

Oww! Fuck! Jesus fuck!

JIM

By any chance, has a woman shown up in

the last half-hour or so?  Maybe she was

looking for me.

EMPLOYEE

Nobody's come in here looking for

anybody.  Just you.

JIM

Are you sure?

EMPLOYEE

(indicating Jim's

eye)

You okay?

JIM

Sherry, it's me.  Are you there? Pick

up.  Okay, it's 4:32.  I came by at 3:25

like we said and waited, but you weren't

there.  Anyway, I hope you're okay --

I'm worried about you. So now I'm just

at the...  at the place we talked about.

Suite 219.  So I'm here.  Everything's

all set.  You can just come over.  Can't

wait. Okay.  Bye.

DICK METZIER

I don't get it.  What you have against

your mother and me, against your brother

Paul, is completely beyond me.  And your

mother is extremely upset, she's at the

end of her rope.  Your behavior gets

crazier and crazier and wilder and

wilder, and who knows what the hell else

you're doing out there that we don't

even know about?

TAMMY

Dad, I

DICK

(jabbing his

finger)

Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare

smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I

(taking a breath)

Now your mother and I have had a long talk

with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off

the phone with him at home. You know, he

doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's

fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't

blame him!

JO

Dick... Dick,..

DICK

What?

JO

(calmly)

Tammy,  now we've come to a decision.

He just think it would be best --

DICK

You're going to Catholic school next

year.  You're going to Sacred Heart.

Maybe they'll straighten you out!

SHERRY AND DIANE

JIM

(very softly)

Okay

JIM (VO)

As I walked out of my home that

evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my

entire life in question, I somehow

discovered within myself a place of

perfect peace.   Oddly, in my solitude I

felt more than ever a sense of communion

with every human being - past, present

and future.  Because no matter what we

tell ourselves, no matter what illusions

of friendship and family we create, each

of us is always and forever profoundly

alone.

TRACY

Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak

with You and ask for things, but now I

really must insist that You help me win

the election tomorrow, because I deserve

it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well

know.  l realize that it was Your divine

hand that disqualified Tammy, and now

I'm asking that You go that one last

mile and make sure to put me in office

where I belong, so that I may carry out

Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven.

If elected I promise that I will pray

more often.  Okay?  Amen.

TAMMY (VO)

Dear God, I know I don't believe in

you, but since I'll be starting Catholic

school soon, I thought I should

practice.  Let's see... what do I want?

I want people to be nicer to each other.

I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she

has been and feel really bad and

apologize for how she hurt me and know

how much I still love her.  In spite of

everything, I still want Paul to win the

election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy.

I also want a really expensive pair of

leather pants... and someday I want to

be really good friends with Madonna.

Love, Tammy

PAUL (VO)

Dear God, thank You for all Your

blessings.  You have given me so many

things, like good health, nice parents,

a nice truck, and what I've been told is

a large penis, and I'm very grateful.

But I sure am worried about Tammy.  In

my heart I still can't believe she tore

down my posters, but sometimes she does

get so weird and angry.  Please help her

be a happier person, because she's so

smart and sensitive, and I love her.

Also, I'm nervous about the election

tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and

all, but I know that's totally up to

You.  You'll decide who the best person

is, and I'll accept it.  And forgive my

sins, whatever they may be.  Amen.

JIM (VO)

Sherry never came home that night.  I

know, because I spent the entire night

in her driveway.

TRACY (VO)

Mom and I got up at five AM, and

together we custom-iced three hundred

and fifty cupcakes.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

TRACY

Mom?

MRS. FLICK

Hmmm?

TRACY

I think I'm going to lose today

MRS. FLICK

What are you talking about? This time

tomorrow, you'll be president

TRACY

You really think so?

MRS. FLICK

Tracy Flick's a winner.

JIM (VO)

I had no choice but to go home. I

needed to shower, get fresh clothes,

explain what I could to Diane.  But what

was I going to say?  That our marriage

had become a charade?  That making love

with Sherry had given me a vision of a

better life?

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Then again, maybe I could slip in and

out without waking her up.

TRACY

(chirping)

Good morning, Mr. M.

TRACY (CONT'D)

(holding one out)

Looks like you could use a cupcake!

TRACY (CONT'D)

(calling out)

What's wrong with your eye?  Are you

OK?

JIM (VO)

Cupcakes.  Jesus Christ.  Cupcakes? My

life was crumbling, and I was expected

to care about these ungrateful kids and

their pathetic little dreams.  As if my

only purpose in life were to serve them.

JIM

(mocking)

Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister.

Somebody tore down my posters. It's not

fair.  It's not fair. Can I have an A?

Can I have a recommendation?  Can I?

Can I?

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Well, fuck them.  Didn't I have my own

life?  Didn't I have my own dreams?

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Cupcakes

MR. BECKMAN

Hey, Jim. Big day today

JIM

(putting on a

smile)

Oh, yeah. Big day.

MISS BEEDER

Attention, everyone.  We have an

important announcement from our

principal. Dr. Hendricks.

WALT

Good morning, students.  It, uh,

behooves me to inform you of an

important change in today's elections.

Effective this morning...

WALT (OS CONT'D)

. .. sophomore Tammy Metzier has

been... Metzier has been determined

ineligible - I repeat: ineligible -- for

SGA president.  You may not vote for

Tammy Metzier.  All other candidates are

eligible.  Now please pay attention to a

very important, uh, audio-visual

presentation.

(irritated,

thinking he's off)

Linda, who typed this thing?  I said I

need all caps....

CLARK (ON TV)

Hello, students,  I'm Clark Naylor of

Joslyn's Educational Resources.  It's

election day, and how you vote will make

a big difference in the activities,

events, and perhaps even the policies of

your school.  Over the past few days or

weeks, you've heard candidates for the

various offices make their speeches and

tell you where they stand.  You've

probably seen their posters.  Maybe

you've even had a chance to speak with

them personally.

CLARK (ON TV CONT'D)

Well, today marks the end of

campaigning, and now the spotlight turns

to you. Voting is your privilege and

your responsibility. Remember, no one

needs to know for whom you've voted.

That's between you. . . and you.

CLARK (ON TV CONT'D)

Now I'd like to introduce you to Tony.

Tony's going to show you how to cast

your vote.  Are you ready, Tony?

TONY (ON TV)

I think s0

CLARK (ON TV)

Good.  Let's get started

SHERRY'S VOICE (VO)

Hi.  You've reached the Novotnys. We're

not around, but we'll call you back real

soon.  Have a nice day.

JIM

Are you there?  Sherry, are you there?

It's Jim.

(suddenly angry)

Why did you do that?  I trusted you.

Completely.  You've ruined my life. Do

you know that?  Do you realize that?

Huh?  Do you?  You've ruined Diane's

life.  You ruined my life.  is that what

you wanted?

(recovering)

I'm sorry.  It's just... I'm going nuts

here.  Okay, all right, so... Really,

I'm sorry.  I just think we should talk,

okay?  I love you.

JIM (VO)

If only my own life could be corrected

so easily, with nice fat black lines

drawn neatly through my sins.

SALESLADY

And Sacred Heart is such a good school.

Excellent school. The public schools are

going downhill, as far as I'm concerned.

JO

Well, we've had good luck at Millard,

but for this one it's time for a change.

SALESLADY

So what do you think?  Sacred Heart has

the prettiest.  They have that nice hint

of purple.

TAMMY

(lying)

I hate it.

JO

You're just going to have to get used

to it.

TAMMY

Please, morn.  Please don't make me go

to Sacred Heart.  I beg you.

JO

(to saleslady)

We'll take two.

TRACY (VO)

When the time came to cast our votes, I

stood in line just like everyone else.

TEACHER

Hi, Tracy

TRACY

Tracy Enid Flick.

TEACHER

I know.

TRACY

Phil you ready?

PHIL

Ready.

PHIL

Just a second.  My flash.

STUDENT

Come on, Tracy.

TRACY

(through her smile)

Just wait.

TRACY

Thanks, Phil.

PAUL

Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?

TRACY

(awkward)

Yeah.

PAUL

Hell, good luck!

TRACY

(reluctant)

Good luck to you too, Paul.

PAUL

Thanks!

PAUL (VO)

It's so weird.  DO people always just

vote for themselves?  'Cause looking at

my own name on the ballot, I just... I

don't know, I just felt like it's not

right to vote for yourself.

LARRY

Okay, Mr. M.

JIM

What?  Right.  So let's start counting.

LARRY

Well, I thought that... well, the way

it always works is that SGA president

does a count, then the SGA advisor, you

know, for the two independent counts.

JIM

Fine.  So do your count.  Start with

president, and I'll be right back.

LARRY

You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

JIM

Right.  I know.

LARRY

Are you okay, Mr. M.?

ANOTHER STUDENT

What happened to your eye?

JIM

I'm fine.  It's just a bee sting, a

simple little everyday bee sting. Some

people, they get stung, it's no big

deal.  Me, I swell up.  Okay?

JIM (CONT'D)

I just want to get this over with, so

we can have the assembly and go home.

We don't have much time until eighth

period.  I have other things going on,

too, you know.

LARRY

Okay.  Yeah.  We know

JIM

All right.  I'll be back

SHERRY'S VOICE

(cheery)

Hi.  You've reached the Novotnys. We're

not around, but we'll call you back real

soon.  Have a nice day.

SHERRY (OS)

(picking up phone)

What do you want, Jim?

JIM

You're there.

SHERRY (OS)

Yeah.  I'm here.

JIM

Sherry... I love you.

SHERRY (OS)

(loud exhale)

Don't say that.  You know it's not

true.

JIM

It's the only true thing I know

anymore.

SHERRY (OS)

We made a mistake.  Let's not make it

worse.

JIM

A mistake?  That was no mistake.

SHERRY (OS)

I was lonely.  You took advantage

JIM

Me?  I took advantage of you?  You

hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the

one who --

PAUL

Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?

JIM

(impatient)

What d'you got?

LARRY

I'm not supposed to tell. Not until

you've counted too. We're each supposed

to make an independent count.

JIM

You're kidding, right?

LARRY

I thought those were the rules, Mr.

McAllister. If they've changed in any

way --

JIM

Larry, we're not electing the fucking

Pope here. Just tell me who won.

LARRY

It's a squeaker, Mr. M. I've got Tracy

by a vote. Just one vote.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Mr. M.?

JIM

Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better

do my count.

DALE

Sputnik.

MR. FLAGG

Right.  And what year was that?

DALE

1958?

MR. FLAGG

Almost.  1957.  So the point here is

when we found out about Sputnik, we got

really scared.  It seemed like no matter

what we had and kept secret, they could

develop it too.  A-bombs, h-bombs,

rocket ships.  And this time we were

behind them.  So -- February 1961,

Kennedy tells Congress and the American

people he wants to go to the moon.  May

1961, the Apollo program is announced...

TRACY (VO)

You know that moment when they announce

the winner of a beauty pageant?  When

Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes

she's Miss America, and all she can do

is scream and weep and hug the losers?

I had my moment in the hallway that

Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but

myself.

JIM (VO)

I was at the end of my count when it

happened.  I'd come up with exactly the

same numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won

the election by a single vote, 256 to

257.  I was about to announce my tally

when...

JIM (VO CONT'D)

The sight of Tracy at that moment

affected me in a way I can't fully

explain.  Part of it was that she was

spying, but mostly it was her face.

Looking at her, you might think she was

a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she

wasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent.

She was selfish and cynical and

ambitious and thought nothing of

destroying the lives of others to get to

the top. who knew how high she would

climb in life, how many people would

suffer because of her? I had to stop her

now.

JIM

Larry?

LARRY

(looking up)

Yeah?

JIM

I think we've got a problem.

WALT

253... 254... 255. I get the same as

you Jim. Looks like Paul's our

president.

LARRY

No way I It doesn't make sense.

WALT

Sorry. My figures work out exactly the

same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for

Tracy.

LARRY

And 290 "disregards," right?

WALT

If you say so.

JIM

Mostly Tammy fans

LARRY

See, it doesn't add up. There are only

801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two

votes are missing. Check the register.

JIM

He's right. Two people must have

pocketed their ballots. Usually it's

more.

LARRY

But, they were there I counted 803

votes.

JIM

It happens, Larry. People make

mistakes.

LARRY

I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was

there when you sac down

WALT

Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where

you're going.

LARRY

I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every

vote was accounted for.

JIM

(stern)

Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes

until the assembly, and we still have to

do counts for VP, Treasurer and

Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both

verified the numbers, and unless you can

come up with the ballots you claim are

missing -

LARRY

But, Mr. M. -

WALT

Fouch, that's enough! End of story.

TRACY

Paul, I just want you to know that no

matter how this turns out, you've run a

wonderful campaign. It's been fun

competing with you.

PAUL

Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad

it's over.

TRACY

Yeah.

PAUL (VO)

You know, I don't understand why

everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the

time.  She was always super- nice to me.

JIM

If we could get started.  People! Once

the winners are announced, we can all go

home, okay?

JIM (CONT'D)

Some contests are so well fought that

is seems unfair for someone to win and

someone to lose.  I think that's the

case with all the candidates you see

before you today.  All of them are

highly qualified and embody the, uh, the

integrity we expect from our school

leadership.

TRACY (VO)

Act surprised. Walk slowly to the

podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this

incredible honor.

JIM

That said, the whole point of an

election is to choose winners, and that

you have done.  We'll begin with

president.

JIM (CONT'D)

Let me add that this was an

extraordinarily close race. It's my

pleasure to announce the next president

of Millard High School.

JIM

Paul Metzier!

PAUL

Geez, you guys, thanks a lot.  I mean,

wow, thanks.  I promise to do my best

and really do a good job and be a good

president.  And I want to thank Lisa

Flanagan for being a super campaign

manager. And I just want to say that I

think Tracy would have made a great

president too and that she really

deserves a big hand.

JIM

And now, for vice-president.

JIM

Could I get a...?

PAUL

Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild.

We came to celebrate my victory, and I

can't believe it. Here, these are my

parents.

DICK METZLER

(extending his

hand)

Hi. Dick Metzier. My wife --

PAUL

This is great.

JIM

(extending his

hand)

JIM McAllister.

JO METZLER

(extending her

hand)

JO Metzier. You know, Paul just thinks

the world of you. Oh, if you could just

hear him...

DICK

Yeah, say, apparently you've really

come behind him, really helped him out

there with the student council thing and

all.

PAUL

I never would have ran if it wasn't for

Mr. M.

JIM

Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's

going places.  You should be very proud.

JO

We are

DICK

Having a problem with your eye there?

JO

Dick.

JIM

Just a bee sting.

DICK

You ought to get that looked at. Shot

of cortisone or something.

JIM

Thanks, I'll be fine.

DICK

Anyway, we're awful sorry about what

went on with our other one, you know,

our Tammy.

JO

We were mortified...

JIM

Oh, she's not a bad girl.  She'll come

around.

JO

... but we've had some good talks, and

I think we're sorting things out.  We're

starting her at Sacred Heart in the

fall.

JIM

Good school.

DICK

Say, you're all alone,  why don't you

join us?

PAUL

Yeah!

JIM

Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up

here, and I've got to get home.

PAUL

(to his parents)

Why don't you guys go sit down, okay?

I'll catch up in a minute? I want to

talk to Mr. M. about some important

stuff.

DICK

All right.  Well, sure nice to meet

you.

JO

So nice

JIM

You bet.

PAUL

So, Mr. M,  I was starting to think

about ideas for next year. I was

thinking it would be cool to have, like

a carnival.  With rides.  And, you know,

it could be for, like. Muscular

Dystrophy.

PAUL (CONT'D)

And on Halloween we could have a

haunted house.  But a really good

haunted house, not like those cheesy bad

ones.  You know, more like the radio

station ones.  This one would be really

scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you

know how last year's theme was -

JIM

Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of

time to get into all this later.  A

whole year, in fact. Right now I just

need to finish my pie and get home.

PAUL

Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh,

do you think Tracy's going to be okay?

I saw her face after the assembly, and I

think she's taking it pretty hard.

JIM

Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be

fine.

TRACY

One vote... one vote

BARBARA

Why don't you take a couple of my

pills, darling? You'll feel better.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Don ' t worry. .. don ' t worry. . .

sshhhhh... that's it, baby... that's it,

darling. Everything's going to be fine.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Maybe you needed more posters, honey.

Or if you'd taken my suggestions about

your speech. I don't know. We'll figure

it out.

JIM

Diane, I...

JIM (VO)

I don't know how Diane and I made it

through that night, but we did.  Our

marriage had gone right to the brink,

but in the end I guess it was saved by

one simple fact: we truly loved each

other.  So we made a commitment to begin

the painful process of piecing our lives

back together.  The worst was over; the

mistakes of the past were behind us.

JIM (VO)

The next day held the promise of a new

beginning. After all, what harm had

really been done? No one was dead.

JIM

Hi, Linda.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Life would go on, and I would certainly

be a stronger and wiser person from the

experience.

MISS BEEDER

Uh, Jim?

JIM

Hmm?

MISS BEEDER

Walt needs to see you.

JIM

Oh.  Okay.

JIM

You rang?

WALT

Mr. McAllister, I hope you can help us

clear something up.

BARBARA

Look at his face!  He knows he's been

caught. Look at his face!

(to Jim)

Your ass is grass, Mister!

LARRY

You said I was a liar   You're the

liar, you're the --

WALT

Larry, you just take it easy

MS. HOY

Yo --

CLASS

pierdo.

MS. HOY

Tu

CLASS

pierdes.

MS. HOY

El/ella -

CLASS

pierde.

MS. HOY

Senor presidente?

MS. HOY (CONT'D)

Quieren verte en la oficina.

PAUL

Huh?

PAUL

Senor presidente. Yo soy senor

presidente... El grande presidente...

PAUL (VO)

I don't know why, but finding out there

was a mistake and I hadn't won the

election after all didn't bother me that

much. Winning had seemed kind of unreal

anyway. I guess I should have voted for

myself. Oh, well.

WALT

(standing up)

Take a seat, son. We've got something

hard to tell you.

PAUL

Is Tammy okay?

WALT

She's okay. It's about the election.

JIM (VO)

After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked

for a few minutes alone with me. It was

very simple, really. I offered my

resignation, and he accepted. Very

quietly, it was all over for JIM

McAllister at Millard High - twelve

years of hard work down the drain.

JIM

Walt will be speaking with you about

this, but I need you to find someone to

take over my classes. The lesson plans

for the rest of the year are in my top

right drawer.

MISS BEEDER

Okay, Jim. I understand.

JIM

Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.

JIM (VO)

I don't remember driving home, or much

of anything that happened in the next

few days.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

There were news stories in the paper

and on television, former students

calling with their support, endless

hours of doing nothing, thinking

nothing.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Diane stood by me through the entire

humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of

evened things out between us.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

Soon school was over, and summer

stretched out in front of me as it

always had. Funny how the rhythm of the

school year remains ingrained in you for

life. in mid-June we found out Diane was

pregnant.

PAUL (VO)

Senior year was great I Sure, I didn't

get to play ball or be president, but I

got elected homecoming king and prom

king anyway. I got into Nebraska like I

wanted and early-rushed Phi Delts. At

the end of the year me and my buddies

threw a hitching Mexican party down at

the cement plant. Shit, that was a good

party. That was a good party!

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

The only really bad thing about senior

year was Lisa. Right before Christmas

she dumped me. One minute she's totally

in love with me and then boom she's

going out with my football buddy Randy.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

Sometimes I wonder what would've

happened if I'd actually won the

election.  Maybe my whole life would be

different.  Like I might never have gone

to Yosemite with Greg and Travis.

PAUL (VO CONT'D)

Or maybe I'd be dead.

TAMMY (VO)

Catholic school was great!

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

I mean, the teachers kind of sucked,

and they were supposedly way more

strict, but you could get away with

murder.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

The best thing about Sacred Heart was

meeting Jennifer.

TAMMY (VO CONT'D)

All those feelings I had for Lisa were

just preparing me for the real thing.

Jennifer and I are soul mates, and we're

never, ever, ever going to be apart.

TRACY (VO)

Senior year was very productive for me

and full of personal achievement.

TRACY

Order.  Order.  Order I  Can we vote on

this?  Those in favor.

TRACY (VO)

On top of a very successful student

council year, I got into Cornell like I

wanted, with scholarships, and I was in

the top 7th percentile of my graduating

class.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd

think about Dave.  I missed our talks.

Maybe it could have worked out between

us.  I don't know.

TRACY (VO CONT'D)

I wonder what he's doing now. Maybe he

finally finished his novel

TRACY (VO)

When the yearbooks came out, I was on

almost every page.

TRACY

Paul, will you sign my yearbook?

PAUL

Sure, Tracy.

TRACY

Can I sign yours too?

PAUL

Oh, yeah, sure.

(to a friend)

Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when

you're done*

TRACY (VO)

I thought very carefully about what to

write.  Because despite everything that

had happened with the election, I really

wished him well.  I even signed it...

PAUL

Thanks, Tracy.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hey, Tracy I..

TRACY

Yes, Paul?

PAUL

Have a great summer.  And good luck at

college.

TRACY

(genuinely moved)

Thanks.  You too.  It was great working

with you.

TRACY (VO)

After graduation, I don't know.  ;

somehow felt empty inside.  I guess high

school just seemed so meaningless now

and I couldn't wait to get out of Omaha.

Next year I was going to make all new

friends.  Smarter, more ambitious

friends.  It was time to move on. There

was nothing left for roe here.  I just

had one more thing to take care of.

JIM (VO)

After two months of sitting on my ass

and two months helping out at my

brother-in-law's travel agency...

JIM (VO CONT'D)

...I landed a position at a Saturn

dealership.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

I never thought I'd end up selling

cars, but it's not so bad. I like the

Saturn philosophy -- it really is a

different kind of company.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

I'm just relieved to have a steady

income now that there are three of us.

JIM (VO)

Actually, it wasn't so difficult making

the transition from teaching to selling.

It's like I tell my customers: my role

is just to educate people so they can

make informed decisions.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

When I send someone home with a new

unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride.

JIM (VO CONT'D)

So that's about it.  Maybe I'll get

back to teaching someday, but for the

time being, I guess I'm pretty happy

where I'm at.

SALESMAN

(to Jim)

Hey, Professor.  There's a young gal

out here asking for you.

JIM

Oh

SALESMAN

(low, as JIM

passes)

She's a real hot tamale.

TRACY

Hello, Mr. M.

JIM

Hello, Tracy.

JIM (CONT'D)

So what brings you here?

TRACY

I'm looking at new cars.

JIM

Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came

to the right place

TRACY

My mother's buying me a new car for

college.

JIM

Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are

you going?  Where 'd you get into?

TRACY

Well, I got in everywhere I applied,

but Cornell is my first choice.

JIM

Good for you.  Good for you

JIM (CONT'D)

So, are you looking for something

sporty or more practical?

TRACY

Sporty.

TRACY

Where to?

JIM

Anywhere you want.

(checks his watch)

Just so long as we're not gone more

than a half-hour.

JIM

Handles pretty good, don't you think?

TRACY

Yeah.

JIM

Plenty of pep, too.

TRACY

Uh-huh.

JIM

And this model comes with ABS and dual

air bags standard.

TRACY

That sounds good.

JIM

So Tracy?

TRACY

Yes?

JIM

Why are you doing this?

TRACY

Doing what?

JIM

Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. .

humiliate me?

TRACY

Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am

looking for a new car.  But I just

thought, well, I'm going away soon, and

you'll be stuck here and, I don't know,

I just think maybe if things had been

different we might have been, well,

friends. Real friends.  And then things

would be different.  Don't you think?

JIM

Well, I... I... that's very nice of

you.

TRACY

(excited)

I've got an idea.

JIM

What's this?

TRACY

My house.

JIM

I don't understand.  What's the deal?

TRACY

I want you to do something for me.

JIM

Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell

awaits him.

TRACY

(getting out)

I just have to get something. I'll be

right back.

JIM

Oh, is this...?

(thumbing through

it)

God. First one of these I haven't been

in for a long time.

TRACY

Would you sign it for me?

JIM

What a surprise.

TRACY

Take as much room as you want

TRACY (CONT'D)

I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel

ready for college.

JIM

You'll be fine.

TRACY

I hope so

JIM

You will.
