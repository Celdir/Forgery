THE REPLACEMENTS

by

Vince McKewin

SECOND DRAFT

February 19,

FADE IN:

EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY

It's raining lightly in the harbor and the

water around the moored boats looks dirty and

cold.

We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in

an end slip.

It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin

cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long

time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood

addition has been nailed to the top of the

cabin. It's partially covered with a blue

plastic tarp.

SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -

FALL

The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked

torso emerges from under it. Shane is late

twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly

going to seed. He looks hung over.

Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He

pulls on the top part of an old patched wet

suit and zips it up. He shivers.

The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON

Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he

throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.

We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of

victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the

trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del

Rey.

CUT TO:

EXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON,

DAY

Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a

Washington Redskin running back and lands on

his throat, elbow first.

It's a beautiful fall day in November and

Miami is beating the Skins in front of

seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.

The Redskins are at their home stadium better

known as "The Big O."

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the

game in shirtsleeves.

SUMMERALL

That play, my friends,

sums up the Redskins'

running game all day

long. Now Washington

calls their last time

out.

Madden leans over to do his diagram that

shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him

as he draws and explains.

MADDEN

Hey, the Dolphins do

this as good as

anybody. See, in a

four, three, two, two,

you got the guards...

boom!... Plugging up

the middle, then the

corners... boom and

boom!     Are free to

box...    leaving the

middle    linebacker to

cut off    the trap

here...    boom!

SUMMERALL

Third and twenty-two,

but forget the first

down with eight seconds

showing and the Skins

down by a touchdown.

MADDEN

Could be the last play.

SUMMERALL

Could be the last play

of the season if the

players go out.

MADDEN (V.O.)

Take it all in, people.

This could be it for

2,000.

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Once again, if you

haven't heard, it was

announced during

halftime that the

N.F.L. Players

Association will hold a

press conference

immediately following

this game -- that would

make it about five

o'clock Eastern time --

and it is expected that

the players' union will

announce a strike

effective immediately.

MADDEN (V.O.)

It's all about money,

folks. More money, of

course and ain't it

always? The shame of

it is the big losers

are you out there, the

fans.

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Here we go: Third

down, eight seconds to

play, ball on the

Dolphins' thirty-three

yard line. Skins down

by a touchdown.

MARTEL

Green 48! Green 48!

Hut! Hut!

MADDEN (V.O.)

There goes Martel!

SUMMERALL

Well... Martel goes

down ten yards short of

a score.

MADDEN

On maybe the last play

of the season.

SUMMERALL

I think he might have

slipped.

MADDEN

Yeah, there's a lot of

that going around.

BOB

We're    coming to your

house    tonight, and

we're    gonna fucking

kill    you! And if you

got a    dog, we're gonna

kill    your fucking dog

too!

CUT TO:

AUGUSTINE

Did they win or lose?!

AUGUSTINE

That has the distinct

tonal quality of a

loss.

AUGUSTINE

Nice medicine for a

loss. Keeps us calm.

Makes us not so sad.

Keeps us on an even

keel. Gives us some

perspective, doesn't

it? And we'll save the

winning medicine for

next Sunday, won't we?

O'NEIL

If you keep talking to

me like I'm a five-

year-old, I'm going to

hurt you.

AUGUSTINE

Sounds exciting.

AUGUSTINE

We'll want to talk to

coach now, won't we?

O'NEIL

(on the phone)

What the fuck was

that?!

TILDON

(on the phone)

I think he slipped.

O'NEIL

Bullshit he slipped!

He could have scored!

Anybody could have

scored! I got one foot

in the god damn grave

and I could have

scored!

TILDON

Mister O'Neil, let's

face facts: The

players are going out.

It's gonna happen. And

nobody wants to get

hurt on the last play

before a strike that

could go on for the

rest of the season.

O'NEIL

You god damn wimp!

You're fired! Get out!

Get out! Get out!

AUGUSTINE

Better? It always

makes you feel better

when you fire someone,

we know it does, don't

we? Yes...

O'NEIL

Get me Jimmy McGinty.

Get him here. Tonight.

CUT TO:

WILSON

Hey, man, I do what my

union says.

REPORTER

But you're already one

of the highest paid

players in the game.

The fans just don't see

the point of a player

like you striking.

WILSON

Let me tell you

something: I'm a big

man, you see?

WILSON

There are some days

when I am so beat up,

that I cannot dress my

own big ass. I asked

management for a valet

or some shit to help me

dress and they said no

way. So, fuck 'em!

PLAYER (O.S.)

Shut up everybody, here

it is...

LINDELL (V.O.)

I have just left a

meeting with

representatives of the

owners and I am sad to

say that they have

refused the players'

final demands which

center around a rise in

the current salary cap.

(MORE)

LINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Therefore, I am

recommending that all

N.F.L. players walk out

and not play until our

demands are met. I

want the players to

walk out tall, to walk

out righteous, to walk

out in the knowledge

that we do this as a

team. We shall

overcome the fat cats.

I send peace to my

union brothers.

WILSON

Shit, I'm goin' to

Vegas.

CUT TO:

McGINTY

You look like shit.

O'NEIL

I'm dying, Jimmy.

McGINTY

You been dying for

twenty years.

McGINTY

That poof of a nurse of

yours is gonna kick my

ass if he catches you

drinking.

O'NEIL

Gimme a butt.

McGINTY

I quit.

O'NEIL

No.

O'NEIL

You pussy. I want you

to come back as head

coach. I fired that

asshole Tilden today.

McGINTY

I'm retired. And

besides, you don't have

a team. They all flew

home in their jets to

their castles.

O'NEIL

We're gonna finish the

season anyway. All of

us owners decided.

We're gonna use

replacement players.

McGINTY

You're a bunch of

greedy bastards, aren't

you?

O'NEIL

Us, greedy?! What

about the god damn

players?! I got the

highest payroll in the

N.F.L. and they still

want more!

McGINTY

That's because you've

been bottle-feeding

straight cash to these

big babies for years.

O'NEIL

No team owner in their

right mind is gonna

give back those T.V.

revenues.

(MORE)

O'NEIL (CONT'D)

All we promised Fox was

twenty-two guys with a

pulse every Sunday.

But think about it,

Jimmy. We got a great

opportunity here! We

got a chance to put a

team on the field that

plays the game just for

the love of it. Like

we used to play it.

McGINTY

We also used to play

without face guards.

O'NEIL

Jimmy, I'm really

dying. The doctor says

I'll be gone by

Superbowl Sunday. Help

me bring a winner back

to D.C. You did it for

me once before. You

can do it again.

McGINTY

Listen: I golf once a

week with the President

of the United States.

I walk my grandkids to

school every day. I

got a    young wife who

will    fuck me any time I

want,    which frankly,

isn't    too often, but

it's    comforting to know

it's    there. I don't

need    it.

O'NEIL

Come on. Wouldn't it

be fun? A bunch of

poor nobodies who play

to win instead of a

bunch of bitchy

millionaires? You can

put it together, Jimmy.

Player's love you.

They always have.

O'NEIL

Tell me you're gonna do

it.

McGINTY

Shut up, I'm thinking.

(pause)

Okay. Here's the deal:

you let me recruit who

I want, with no

interference?

O'NEIL

Absolutely.

McGINTY

I'm talking anybody I

want. No exceptions.

And no interference

with my coaching,

either, like you used

to.

O'NEIL

Sure, Jimmy, sure.

McGINTY

And one more thing: no

more Notre Dame

stories. You start

telling me Notre Dame

stories and I pull your

plug personally.   I

swear to God.

O'NEIL

Deal.

CUT TO:

PILACHOWSKI

... Six phone lines

with internet access on

two: One for defense

and one for offense.

BANES

We thought we would

skip special teams for

the moment.

PILACHOWSKI

Except for a kicker.

We definitely need a

kicker. A place kicker

over a punter.

BANES

The thinking being that

if we lose the toss, we

have to be able to at

least kick off.

PILACHOWSKI

Okay. Here's the list

of every player cut

this past season. What

we would like to do

is...

McGINTY

(interrupting)

Those people?

(pointing to

list)

Most of them were cut

because they were

shitty.

McGINTY

We're going to go

another way here. I've

done some scouting

since I retired. On an

ad hoc basis, of

course. And what I

have here is a list of

people I've kept an eye

on. They've all played

football somewhere, but

only a few in the pros.

And they've all got

something... unique to

bring to the game.

We're gonna take these

people and try to put

together a winning

team. And if nothing

else, they should be

fun to watch.

EVANS

You won't need a

center.

McGINTY

How you doin', Reese?

EVANS

Bored and ready to

retire. I'm just

looking for one more

hit. One more really

good hit.

McGINTY

What about the strike?

EVANS

Hell, I'm rich. I got

no complaint with

Mister O'Neil. I just

want a chance to play

one last time.

(MORE)

EVANS (CONT'D)

Shit, I'd rather go out

with a broken leg than

sitting on the bench.

McGINTY

Welcome to the new

Washington Redskins.

(to his coaches)

Let's find Reese

somebody to play with.

CUT TO:

BIKER

Did you hear something?

COP #1

Jesus, Bateman! Why

don't you ever wait for

us?!

BIKER #2

Not me.

BATEMAN

What area code is 703?

COP #1

Washington, D.C.

CUT TO:

KID

Nice hands.

CLIFFORD

(not amused)

What else?

KID

A pack of Marlboro

Reds, a pint of Martel

Cognac and a box of

Trojans, extra long.

CLIFFORD

Get out of here. I'm

telling your mother you

were talking like that.

MANAGER

Hey, Clifford, somebody

on the phone wants you

to play football next

weekend.

CLIFFORD

Tell 'em I gotta work

Saturday. And I'm

watching the Redskins

on Sunday. Ain't

nothing stopping me

from watching the

Redskins on Sunday.

(mumbling)

No way that's gonna be

happening, me not

watching the Redskins

on Sunday.

MANAGER

(into phone)

He's gotta work.

(pause)

They said they'll pay

you.

CLIFFORD

Pay me?    How much?

MANAGER

(on phone)

How much?

(pause)

Ten thousand five

hundred dollars!

CLIFFORD

(stunned)

Ray, who the fuck is on

the phone?!

MANAGER

(pause)

It's the Washington

Redskins!

CUT TO:

JAMAL

(to someone)

Get out of the way!

(to someone

else)

Don't look at him! He

don't like being looked

at, god damn it! No

eye contact!

CUT TO:

McGINTY (O.S.)

You look like a

swordfish I caught

once.

McGINTY

He hit the deck just

like that.

SHANE

And you look like that

coach from the

Seventies. From the

Redskins. McGinty.

Except you look a

shitload older.

McGINTY

The price of happiness.

Something to take the

chill off?

McGINTY

I'm running the

Redskins again. And I

want you to quarterback

'em.

SHANE

No, man, I've been out

way too long.

McGINTY

What, three years since

San Diego dumped you?

That's nothing. You're

in shape, flopping

around in the water

like that.

SHANE

You know what my

nickname was in San

Diego, don't you?

McGINTY

Sure.   Footsteps.

SHANE

As in, I hear 'em and I

dump the ball.

McGINTY

Well, you didn't have

much of a line to

protect you.

SHANE

I got two concussions

to prove it.

McGINTY

That's why girls don't

play the game.

McGINTY

I scouted you when you

were playing at Ohio

State. I told San

Diego they were

probably making a

mistake when they

signed you.

SHANE

(truly shocked)

No kidding?

McGINTY

Oh, you had a lot of

tools: a quick

release. Fast. A

scrambler by nature.

Good downfield vision.

But you got hurt a lot.

And worst of all, you

never could win the big

game. What did you

lose the Sugar Bowl by,

your senior year?

What, forty points?

SHANE

Forty-five. And now

you want to recruit me?

McGINTY

A scrambling

quarterback is gonna do

real well in this new

replacement

environment. And to

tell you the truth, I

think I can help you

with your biggest

problem.

SHANE

Okay.   What's my

biggest problem?

McGINTY

Courage. I think that

Sugar Bowl took it all

out of you.

SHANE

I'm retired from

football.

McGINTY

Yeah, and it looks like

things have been going

really well for you

since.

SHANE

I like being here.

It's quiet. I like

being alone.

McGINTY

Yeah. No screaming

crowds, that's for

sure.

(pause)

You know what separates

the winners from the

losers? Gettin' back

on the horse. The one

that kicked you in the

teeth. You're still

young. You still got

bags of talent. If you

do well, who knows what

will happen when the

strike ends?

McGINTY

You want me to tell you

you're not going to get

hurt? You know you

will. No doubt about

that. But, hell...

McGINTY

... Wouldn't you rather

get hurt than scrape

the shit off of other

guys' toys?

CUT TO:

PASSERBY #1

Deuce and an eightball

on Go Down, Rita in the

eighth.

MOTHER

Louis, you got a phone

call!

LOU

(from across the

street)

Who is it?

MOTHER

It's the Washington

Foreskins.

LOU

What?! Ma, what are

you, out a your tree?

MOTHER

(yelling louder)

I'm telling you they

said it's the

Washington Foreskins!

Foreskins! Foreskins!

Foreskins!

CUT TO:

ROLAND

Cut right on me, now.

Right on me.

ROLAND

Not right on me,

goddamn it!

VOICE (O.S.)

Coach Lamont! Phone

call! Long distance.

Washington, D.C. It's

the Washington

Redskins!

ROLAND

(to the sky)

Thank you, Lord!

CUT TO:

EVANS

Nice. Try a roll to

the right.

O'NEIL (V.O.)

Shane 'Footsteps'

Falco? This is what

you're going to build

an offense around?

O'NEIL

Christ, Jimmy, I ask

you to build me a team

based on balls and the

first player I see is

Footsteps Falco?!

McGINTY

He's got as much

natural talent as any

quarterback in the

league.

O'NEIL

And he's got the

happiest feet I've ever

seen!

McGINTY

All he needs is a shot

of self-confidence.

He's our quarterback.

That's the way it is.

O'NEIL

What about a safety?

We got two a days

starting tomorrow and a

game in five days! And

we still don't have a

safety?!

AUGUSTINE

Here we go. Nice fat

little hits.

O'NEIL

I called a friend of

mine who just happens

to be the Governor of

Maryland.

McGINTY

Terrific, the Governor

is going to play

safety?

O'NEIL

Don't worry about it.

CUT TO:

REPORTER

As president of the

Players' Association,

what does your presence

mean here, Mister

Lindell?

LINDELL

Very simply, support

for these fine players

and union men.

Washington D.C. is the

home of freedom and the

collective bargaining

agreement. I am here

to remind all Americans

that the owners are no

better than the robber

barons of the

Nineteenth Century.

They have blatantly

gone out and hired

scabs, which is against

all principles of our

Constitution and the

Declaration of

Independence and

probably even the

Emancipation

Proclamation.

LINDELL

And here come the

Scabskins now!

PLAYERS

Scabskins! Scabskins!

Scabskins!

CLIFFORD

Oh God, there's Eddie

Martel! And Wilson

Jones! I love Wilson

Jones! Yo, Wilson!

Yo, player!

LOU

Hey, Lou Pacifico.

SHANE

Shane Falco.

LOU

I know. I lost a ton a

money on that Sugar

Bowl disaster of yours.

Wow. Did you get your

butt kicked or what?

JAMAL

You know I don't take

that shit.

ANDRE

Be cool.

PLAYERS

Scabskins! Scabskins!

CUT TO:

McGINTY

(to Sid)

What is this?

McGINTY

He's a quarterback!

How is he supposed to

see?

SID

He told me he was a

linebacker!

SHANE

I can see.

McGINTY

How many fingers?

SHANE

Two.   No, wait.    Three.

CUT TO:

PILACHOWSKI

Oh my God. That's

disgusting!

McGINTY

How you doin', Mickey?

LEE

Not bad, Coach.

McGINTY

You look great. Why

don't you work out at

left tackle?

LEE

You got it.

PILACHOWSKI

You're not serious.

McGINTY

I met Mickey in Hawaii.

When he was even

bigger. He's a Sumo

wrestler. That means

he's an expert at

pushing people around.

That's what pass

blocking is, Leo.

BANES

(to McGinty)

I got a defensive end

who's deaf!!

PILACHOWSKI

(watching Lee

walk

away)

I'll trade you for a

tackle who's gonna play

in a diaper.

BANES

How can I coach a deaf

man?!

McGINTY

You don't have to...

McGINTY

Brian Murray would have

gone in the first round

five years back if he

hadn't been born deaf.

I first saw him play

right here in D.C. for

Galludet College. He's

a hell of an athlete.

You won't have to tell

him anything.

BANES

I can't believe it! I

got to be able to

communicate with him.

McGINTY

Then learn to sign.

Hey, look at it this

way: He'll never get

pulled off sides on an

audible.

SHANE

Oh shit! No!

BATEMAN

Hi, I'm Danny.

SHANE

(groaning)

Shane.

McGINTY

Nice pop, Danny.

BATEMAN

Thank's, Coach!

SHANE

What was that?

McGINTY

Danny Bateman. Ex-cop,

ex-Marine, ex-rugby.

He's absolutely

harmless, if you just

play dead.

McGINTY

San Diego used you all

wrong. You're not a

drop back passer.

You're a scrambler.

Like you were in

college. So, we're

gonna roll out. A lot.

Get used to setting up

on the run. You'll

live a lot longer.

SHANE

I'm very interested in

that.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNABELLE

Annabelle Farrell, head

Redskinette.

SHANE

Excuse me?

ANNABELLE

I'm in charge. Of the

Redskinettes. The

cheerleaders?

SHANE

Oh yeah, hi.

ANNABELLE

I've been watching you.

You look good. You

look strong. Good

quick release. Smart.

You read defenses

quickly. You're gonna

do great.

SHANE

Hey... thanks.

ANNABELLE

I saw your second

concussion. The one

against Cleveland.

Pow! You could hear it

in the cheap seats.

But you completed the

pass. That's what

counts.

SHANE

I guess so.

ANNABELLE

If there's anything you

need, let me know. And

I mean anything, okay?

You understand?

SHANE

Sure.   I understand.

ANNABELLE

They put you up at the

Hilton?

SHANE

Yeah.

ANNABELLE

Good. Remember:

anything. You got it?

Okay?

McGINTY

... because it's a damn

waste of all that

speed, Clifford. I

told you that when you

were in high school.

You've got to catch the

ball, son. This is the

main idea of the

passing game.

CLIFFORD

I know, Coach, I know.

McGINTY

Okay. I assume that

you have touched a

woman in a romantic

way, have you not?

CLIFFORD

Oh yeah, Coach, sure.

In a, you know,

romantic way.

McGINTY

Good. From here on

out, you touch this

football, all the

time...

McGINTY

... just like you touch

your girl friends. I

better not see you

without this ball. You

understand?

CLIFFORD

Coach, wait! Can I

still like touch my

girl friends if I

don't, you know, let go

of the ball?

McGINTY

Yes, Clifford, if you

can manage that,

absolutely.

CUT TO:

SHANE

... just glad to be

back playing. That's

all I've really got to

say.

REPORTER

But where have you

been? What have you

been doing to make a

living?

SHANE

Well... I've been

involved lately in

the... aquatic

business...

MICKEY

You only played one

game?!

ROLAND

Actually, less than two

minutes. I was a

rookie third round pick

in '93. We were

playing Atlanta in the

home opener. Near the

end of the first

quarter, they sent me

in, I took a screen

pass over the middle

and got hit by both

linebackers.

Simultaneously. One a

side. My knee turned

into wet toilet paper.

End of career.

MICKEY

Can you play on it now?

ROLAND

I've been teaching high

school football for

five years. It's not a

bad life. I'm good at

it. There are some

days when I actually

love it. But for one

more shot at this?

Shit. I'd give it all

up. This time, they're

gonna have to take me

out in a box.

CLIFFORD

I got Wilson Boone's

locker, man. Do you

believe that shit?

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTEL

Hey, you can't park

there.

SHANE

Look, I don't want any

trouble.

MARTEL

You don't want any

trouble?! You're

taking my job away, but

you don't want any

trouble?

(to Wilson)

He doesn't want any

trouble, but he puts

this piece of shit in a

no parking zone.

SHANE

Okay.   I'll move it.

MARTEL

No, we'll do that for

you. Go ahead, Wilson.

Move it for him.

JAMAL (O.S.)

You all put that car

back.

WILSON

Who the fuck are you?

ANDRE

We're the people who

take care of the

quarterback. We're the

guards.

JAMAL

Put the car back.

Gently.

WILSON

Kiss my ass.

SHANE

(to Jamal)

It's okay.

JAMAL

No, it's not.

JAMAL

(to Wilson)

That's your ride, ain't

it?

WILSON

My windshield! You

crazy motherfucker!

JAMAL

Move his car back.

WILSON

My car!

WILSON

No!   Stop!

WILSON

Come on, help me, god

damn it!

WILSON

(to Jamal)

You are gonna pay for

this.

JAMAL

No I'm not. And quit

messing with my man

here. That includes

his ride.

ANDRE

Let's go to practice,

Shane.

SHANE

Let's do that.

CUT TO:

ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.)

... so if anyone does

have any firearms, we

need to turn those in

as soon as possible, no

questions asked...

WALTER

Praise the Lord, Shane.

SHANE

Yeah.   Sure.

WALTER

Walt Cochran.

Offensive tackle.

WALTER

Shane, will you witness

with me?

SHANE

Will I what?

WALTER

Will you witness with

me? For this upcoming

practice.

SHANE

Now?

WALTER

Praise the Lord for

giving us a way to

eliminate, Shane. Why

not talk to Him in the

gift?

WALTER

Heavenly Father, thank

you for allowing us to

pee the poisons from

our systems. Please

help us in today's

practice to be strong

and...

CUT TO:

BANES

Where did you play,

Judge? Wait. Do I

call you judge?

JUDGE

Your Honor, or Judge is

fine. I played at

Harvard. But I played

in the days when you

went both ways.

Offense and defense.

When players were

really tough.

(to Wilkinson)

And where did you play

college ball... I'm

sorry, what was your

name again?

WILKINSON

Smith. Ray Smith. I

played at a junior

college nobody ever

heard of. What

position did you play

on defense, Judge?

JUDGE

Middle linebacker.

WILKINSON

Yeah, big fellow like

you, that's what I

would have guessed.

JUDGE

It was a different game

in those days. Raw.

Powerful. No tricks,

like today.

WILKINSON

You know, maybe you can

show me some of your

technique, Your Honor.

Maybe you can show me

some of that toughness.

JUDGE

I'd be glad to!

ANNABELLE

(O.S.)

You would think he's

done enough.

ANNABELLE

McGinty, I mean.

SHANE

I was kind of thinking

the same thing.

ANNABELLE

My theory is he came

out of retirement to

see if he could win

with losers.

(pause)

Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

I didn't mean...

SHANE

(interrupting)

Hey, it's okay. I've

been called worse.

ANNABELLE

Like    after that Sugar

Bowl    game? I guess you

could    survive anything

after    that.

SHANE

Sometimes I feel like

everybody in the world

saw that game. Like I

could go to India and

some little guy would

run up to me and say,

'Boy, did you suck in

the '92 Sugar Bowl.'

SHANE

So, how come you're

such a fan?

ANNABELLE

My dad. He's a huge

Redskin fan. For

years. He's in his

twenty-ninth year at

the Senate Office

Building. As a guard,

not a senator. The

only thing that keeps

him going he says, is

me and the Redskins.

That's where I get it.

My fan-ness.

(suddenly)

Are you scared?

SHANE

Scared? Well... yes.

Absolutely.

ANNABELLE

It's okay. Anybody

would be. But you're

good. And you'll do

good.

SHANE

Well, thank you. Look,

I gotta study the play

book tonight. So...

I'll see you.

ANNABELLE

Break a leg tomorrow.

SHANE

What?!

ANNABELLE

It's    from the theater.

For    opening night. You

say    the worst thing

that    can happen. And

it won't.   Break a leg.

JUDGE

Alright, this is how we

used to stop a running

back.

WILKINSON

I can't wait.

WILKINSON

Oooh... got me a judge!

Man, that felt good!

CUT TO:

LINDELL

(to kid)

Don't be asking    for no

autographs from    the

real players and    then

go in and watch    the

scabs!

LINDELL

(to the player)

That is not the message

we want to send our

children!

CUT TO:

EVANS

You okay?

EVANS

Remember to nod your

head on the snap.

SHANE

(out of it)

Nod my head?

EVANS

For    when Murray's in.

The    deaf kid. Hello?

He    needs to look at you

on    the snap.

PILACHOWSKI

What are you, crazy?

Nobody eats right

before a game.

LEE

I always ate before a

big match. I need the

bulk.

COCHRAN

Coach McGinty, I'd like

to lead the team in the

pregame prayer.

McGINTY

No. No praying.

That's the problem with

professional sports

today: too much god

damn praying. Five

hundred dollar fine to

the first man I hear

praying.

McGINTY

A lot of people are

waiting for you to fall

on your asses today.

And guess what? You're

going to. But I don't

give a shit if you look

funny out there. Or if

you miss a block, or

drop a pass, or trip

over your own dick.

This is professional.

And the difference

between professional

and amateur, between

playing for the

Washington Redskins and

Michigan State is

simply... money. You

are being paid to win.

Not just to play. Not

just to learn how to be

good sports. Not for

the alumni. You are

being paid to win. I

don't care how the fuck

you do it. But I'm

demanding it. Because

those guys whose place

you're taking have

forgotten that simple

fact. So, go win it.

CUT TO:

MADDEN

... Pretty bold move by

New England Patriot

owner Victor Kiam, who

went out and bought an

entire semi-pro team

once the strike

happened.

(MORE)

MADDEN (CONT'D)

Redskin management, on

the other hand, is

going with a bunch of

unknowns. Their public

relations people don't

even have bios yet on

most of their players,

although we'll see one

or two familiar faces

out there today.

SUMMERALL

Like Shane Falco, the

enormously talented

college quarterback

from Ohio State, who

never fulfilled his

potential in the pro's.

(to Madden)

Wow, remember that

Sugar Bowl Falco

quarterbacked when

Florida State creamed

them?

MADDEN

Oh, yeah, they were

absolutely decimated!

SUMMERALL

Dusted. And if I'm not

mistaken, Falco set a

record in that game for

Bowl interceptions.

Anyway, for some of

these players this is

another shot; a last

shot, probably, for a

guy like Falco...

CUT TO:

ANNOUNCER

(V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen,

your Washington

Redskins!

ANNOUNCER

Here's the starting

number 56, Daniel

Bateman!

SUMMERALL

Oh, my...

JAMAL

Bastards.

ANNOUNCER

(V.O.)

And now... uh, the rest

of the Washington

Redskins.

CUT TO:

ANDRE

That's where I stand.

LEE

No it's not.

ANDRE

Come on, man, that's my

spot in the huddle.

McGINTY (V.O.)

All right, son, nice

and easy now. Let's

run our ten planned

plays, get a feel for

the land...

ANDRE

... Fat fucking nip!

You don't know shit!

LEE

What did you call me?!

ANDRE

You heard me, you tub a

rice shit!

SHANE

Hold on, what's the

problem here?

LEE

I'm gonna kick your

black ass...

ANDRE

You ain't kickin' jack

shit...

JAMAL

(to Lee)

Don't be messing with

my brother...

SHANE

Hey, hold on...

REF

Delay of game!    Five

yards!

SUMMERALL

... I don't know.

Something seems to be

going on in the huddle.

It looks like... yes,

Shane Falco is on his

back. They haven't run

a play yet but Falco is

down.

MADDEN

This is not a good

sign.

SHANE

(clearing the

cobwebs)

What happened? Am I

hurt already?

SHANE

God damn it! I am the

quarterback! I am the

only one supposed to

talk in the huddle!

ANDRE

Yeah, but he took my

place...

SHANE

I don't give a shit!

SHANE

Huddle up!

SHANE

If you've got something

to say, raise your

hand! Is that

understood?!

LEE

Suppose like, you don't

feel good. Or you're

hurt or something like

that. Then what?

SHANE

Then you tell me before

the huddle starts!

Okay, listen up: 68

blue east storm toss.

On two.

SHANE

What?!

JAMAL

That's to the right...

right?

ANDRE

No, it's to the left.

SHANE

It's to the right!

JAMAL

You better be quiet,

Shane, they'll hear

you.

REF

Delay of game!     Five

yards!

McGINTY

What the hell is going

on?

MADDEN

Well, Pat, so far the

Redskins have minus ten

yards offensively.

O'NEIL

Turn it off. This is

going to kill me.

SHANE

Blue 68. Blue 68!

Hut! Hut!

SHANE

Have you suddenly

decided you don't like

me, Jamal?

JAMAL

Oh. You said it was to

the right, didn't you?

SHANE

Okay. Let's try

something simple. 18

red left slot open.

(to Jamal)

That's to the left!

SHANE

Eighteen red! Eighteen

red! Hut! Hut!

SHANE

Yeah!

REF

Holding! Number 78.

COCHRAN

You see. We should

have prayed.

SHANE

Shut up! Pass. 22

Solo right slot 'A,' Y

SHANE

Twenty-two green.    Hut!

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Washington comes up a

minus fourteen yards on

their first possession.

EARL

Wide right! You got

wide right! Check on

the wing!

PATRIOT QB

Blue fourteen!

PATRIOT QB

Green eighty-seven!

SUMMERALL

I think the Redskins

just set a record for

penalties in the first

three minutes. We're

waiting for the stats

on that...

You had Lamont open in

McGINTY (V.O.)

Come on, now, son.

Pick up your pace on

the roll. See the big

picture. Pump and

fake, pump and fake.

SHANE

What?

LEE

I don't feel good.

ANDRE

Oh, God!

COCHRAN

Oooooh...

JAMAL

Man, that's ripe!

EVANS

Shane, we got to move!

SHANE

Okay. On the count of

three. Everyone more

left. Hut! Hut! Hut!

PATRIOT LB

What the fuck is this?

SUMMERALL

John, how many years

have we been calling

games together?

MADDEN

Seventeen, I think.

SHANE

U brown right, west 19

A lead. That's you,

Mickey. Puke on him if

you have to.

SHANE (O.S.)

Hut!

MADDEN (V.O.)

Very nice off tackle

run by Lamont.

Execution was letter

perfect.

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

That puts the Redskins

in field goal range.

And here comes Pacifico

to see if he can get

them on the board

before the half ends.

MADDEN (V.O.)

This will be a forty-

five yarder. That's a

tough distance for your

first N.F.L. field goal

try.

SHANE

Hut!

CUT TO:

McGINTY

(quietly)

You got to look for

Murray over the middle.

You got to trust me on

this: he's a big,

tough kid with good

hands.

SHANE

We can't put three

plays together without

a penalty, a fumble of

a fight.

McGINTY

You still got a whole

half left. You're a

thoroughbred out there

running against a bunch

a nags. You can pick

these fuckers apart.

SHANE

You're good. You're

really good.

CUT TO:

SUMMERALL

Another terrific

interception by Smith.

That's his second.

MADDEN

Yeah, this guy is a

player.

MADDEN

According to the

Redskins, Ray Smith...

is... that's weird. No

college given, no high

school given. It just

says he's been a

resident of the state

of Maryland for the

last four years and

five months. Likes to

embroider.

CUT TO:

McGINTY (V.O)

Half your job is

getting that huddle in

the right mindset. Use

your imagination,

Shane.

SHANE

Okay, let's all take a

few seconds to think

about what we were

doing for a living...

just last week.

SHANE

Good. Let's kick ass.

MADDEN (V.O.)

... began with a

Redskin end around, but

Cochran, the pulling

tackle ran into Falco's

pitchout ... see?

(MORE)

MADDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Right here, it bounced

off his helmet. Then

it was kicked by Landon

and then Hayes touched

it, I think, and then

Green got a hand on it,

and then Bellinski

recovered it and then

he lost it, and finally

the ball took a crazy

bounce right back into

Falco's hands, look at

his face here. He's as

surprised as anybody!

Falco then ran it back

to just about the

original line of

scrimmage, executed the

same play -- an end

around to Murray -- and

the Skins score.

Welcome to Strike

Football!

DISSOLVE TO:

SHANE

Hut, hut!

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Falco is intercepted.

That's too bad.

MADDEN (V.O.)

Yeah, and it looks like

he's hurt, too. He was

really starting to put

it together here in the

fourth quarter. Only

forty-eight seconds now

left on the clock.

McGINTY

Danny.

(very slowly)

Get me the ball.

BATEMAN

The ball. Okay, Coach.

PATRIOT QB

Hut, hut, hut!

McGINTY

Don't shake your head

at me. You are going

back in there. You are

gonna run the same god

damn play, you are

gonna throw the ball to

Franklin again and this

time, he's gonna score.

SHANE

I can't...

McGINTY

You are the only one in

this entire stadium who

can do it. Do you

understand me? You can

do something no one

else can do. So, start

right here. Start

living your destiny.

Or give it up for good.

Right here. Right now.

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Here comes Falco with

eighteen seconds left

on the clock.

MADDEN (V.O.)

I'm surprised to see

him again after that

shot he took from

Bellinski.

SHANE

22 green!

SHANE

Check! Black 43!

Black 43!

ANDRE

What's that mean?

REESE

(whispering

back)

He's changing the play.

Listen!

SHANE

Black 43!

MADDEN (V.O.)

It's a long count.

Falco could be calling

an audible.

LAMONT

(to Shane)

Is this right?

SHANE

(shaking his

head)

Black 43 left!

SHANE

Hut!   Hut!

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

Lamont scores!

MADDEN (V.O.)

Whoa! Falco calls an

audible at the line of

scrimmage and Lamont

takes it in!

McGINTY (V.O.)

(in Shane's

helmet)

I guess you saw

something I didn't.

McGINTY (V.O.)

Don't try to bullshit

me, pal. You didn't

want it. Winners

always want the ball

with the game on the

line. You know that.

McGINTY (V.O.)

Alright. The play

is... waggle right,

drag hook. You

understand?

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

With eight seconds

remaining, Pacifico

will try the extra

point that will send

this game into

overtime.

MADDEN (V.O.)

This turned out to be

one hell of a contest,

Pat!

SHANE

Hut!

MADDEN (V.O.)

It's a fake!

REESE

We won, Shane.   We won!

DISSOLVE TO:

SHANE

... ultimately, it's a

pain thing, you know?

I mean, it's Darwinian,

the survival of the

numbest. Whoever can

take the pain most,

gets the largest

contract. It's sick.

WOMAN

IN RED

Exactly. Let me buy

you another.

WOMAN IN RED

I don't know how you do

it. I hate pain. Pain

is a no no as far as

I'm concerned.

SHANE

(slurring)

I'm glad that you are

concerned.

WOMAN    IN RED

Hey, are you    alright?

I'll take you    up to

your room, if    you like.

SHANE

I would like.

CUT TO::

SHANE

Here's home.

WOMAN IN RED

A friend of mine is

going to join us, okay?

WOMAN IN BLUE

Hi.   Ready to party?

SHANE

(looking at both

women)

Oooooh. Bookends.

WOMAN IN BLUE

And you're the book,

baby.

ANNABELLE

(to the girls)

Go away. Both of you.

WOMAN IN RED

Fuck off!

SHANE

(to Annabelle)

These are my guests.

WOMAN IN RED

(now bleeding)

You crazy bitch!

SHANE

Why did you do that?

ANNABELLE

You were about to be

rolled.

SHANE

(as he enters)

That's what I was

hoping.

ANNABELLE

They work the bar

downstairs looking for

drunk Redskins.

SHANE

I guess they found one.

ANNABELLE

Don't feel so bad.

It's a rookie mistake.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNABELLE

Here.   Take this.

SHANE

(groaning)

What is it?

ANNABELLE

It's for the pain.

Take it. It's only a

little bit illegal.

SHANE

Oh, God. I've got to

go to the bathroom.

It's far away, isn't

it?

ANNABELLE

I'll help. We'll just

take our time.

ANNABELLE

Kidneys.

SHANE

Oh, man. My hair

hurts.

ANNABELLE

You took a hell of a

beating. The martinis

didn't help, either.

ANNABELLE

Don't be afraid if

you've got blood in

your urine. That's

normal.

SHANE (O.S.)

Did you undress me?

ANNABELLE

Yes.

SHANE (O.S.)

And you... slept here

with me?

ANNABELLE

Yes.

SHANE (O.S.)

Did we... ?

ANNABELLE

Are you kidding? You

were catatonic.

SHANE

No blood.

ANNABELLE

Good.   Back to bed.

SHANE

May I ask you a

personal question?

SHANE

Do you do this for all

Redskin quarterbacks?

ANNABELLE

Of course not.

SHANE

Then why me?

ANNABELLE

I don't know. I guess

I can't resist a man

who can take a hit.

SHANE

I can't take a hit!

ANNABELLE

Shhh. It's all in your

head. Now, get some

sleep.

CUT TO:

ANNABELLE

You're the golden boy

in the press this

morning.

ANNABELLE

'Falco scores big.'

(to herself)

Well... not really.

Hey, a lot of the

regular players are

starting to cross the

picket line.

SHANE (O.S.)

Redskins?

ANNABELLE

It doesn't say.

ANNABELLE

Where are you going?

SHANE

McGinty called a dinner

meeting with the whole

team.

SHANE

Thank you. Thanks

for... everything.     You

saved my life.

ANNABELLE

No. Probably just your

wallet and your watch.

SHANE

And that pill, that

sure worked.

ANNABELLE

You're basic double D

McGINTY

Alright, listen up:

There have been a lot

of rumors about the

regular players

crossing the picket

lines. They are not

rumors. Many union

players have now seen

the error of their ways

and are coming back in

droves. Apparently,

they have been struck

with the realization

that it is a blessing

to be playing

professional football.

McGINTY

But they had their

chance. Now it's your

turn. Mister O'Neil

and I have agreed to

ban all striking

players and to continue

to go with you guys.

your strategy against

New York this Sunday?

Hi.    Come in.

ANNABELLE

No.

ANNABELLE

We don't travel with

Tylenol with codeine,

magic bullet one that I

gave you before, and a

you actually break

something. Pop 'em in

SHANE

Wow.    Thanks.

ANNABELLE

I'll be watching on TV.

The Giants got back

Plus their middle

SHANE

Yeah.   I know.

ANNABELLE

What can I say? Go

MORRIS

(in Shane's ear)

Hello, again!

MADDEN

That's all-pro Hank

Morris's third sack,

his second here in the

fourth quarter and the

sixth of the day for

the Giants. Falco is

gonna be sore tonight.

SUMMERALL

If he can stay alive

that long. Ten-three

turned out to be an

incredible defensive

duel.

LINDELL

brothers, and

brotherhood and

That's why I am so

grateful to our

Teamster brothers who

SHANE

(to Reese Evans)

You got to double up on

Morris.

EVANS

He's too far outside

for me to get to him.

(to Cochran)

Bring him down and sit

on him.

COCHRAN

He's huge! He's been

beating the crap out of

me all day! I feel

like a rag doll out

here.

Okay. Spread left 'A'

Right, roll right Half

McGINTY

You want a time-out?

That looks like it

hurt.

SHANE

Huddle up!

SHANE

Same thing... Except...

(to Lee and

Cochran)

Let him in. Don't

touch him.

LEE

What?

EVANS

Shane...

SHANE

Shut up! Let him

through. On two.

SHANE

Stop with the lovefest!

Let's get the goddamn

ball back and win this

thing!

No! Danny, go down!

You're using up the

clock!

SHANE

Time out!

BATEMAN

Beautiful tackle,

Shane!

SUMMERALL

Now that's something

you don't see everyday!

SHANE

We got time for one

play, but if we don't

get it out of bounds,

the game is over.

McGINTY

Yeah, but you're

looking at a sixty-five

yard kick from here.

PACIFICO

(smoking a butt)

No problem.

SHANE

Seriously?

PACIFICO

(to Shane)

You hold it. I'll kick

it.

McGINTY

What the fuck.

MADDEN

I can't believe it!

McGinty is gonna let

Pacifico try the field

goal from sixty-five

yards out!

SUMMERALL

Hey, John, this kid has

got a heck of a foot.

STRAM

But sixty-five yards?

Come on!

MADDEN    (V.O.)

Pat... did he    just? I

think that guy    is

smoking on the    field!

SUMMERALL

(V.O.)

No, I think you

imagined that one,

John.

SHANE

You look great, Lou,

you know that?

LOU

Really? Thanks, Shane.

That means a lot to me.

SHANE

Hut!

MADDEN (V.O.)

It's straight enough!

If it's got the

distance, it's...

MADDEN (V.O.)

Good!     Redskins win!

CUT TO:

ANNABELLE

Are you hurt?

SHANE

No.     Not really.

ANNABELLE

You're getting used to

being slapped around.

That's a good sign.

SHANE

I...

ANNABELLE

Would you like to come

in and make love?

SHANE

Yes. No. I'm here

because ... I don't

want to be alone.

ANNABELLE

Most    of the world feels

that    way. You don't

have    to be embarrassed

about    it.

SHANE

But to tell you the

truth... I'm kind of

scared of you.

ANNABELLE

I won't hurt you.

CUT TO:

ANNABELLE

That shoulder is going

to need special

handling.

SHANE

You know what hurts

worse than my shoulder?

ANNABELLE

I can't imagine.

SHANE

Their defensive end

punched me in the

mouth.

SHANE

Seriously. It's

killing me.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHANE

... after that game,

after being beaten that

badly in front of the

whole country, after

humiliating myself, my

team, my school, my

family, I mean -- did

you know that I set two

Sugar Bowl records?! I

was sacked eleven

times! I threw six

interceptions!

ANNABELLE

Okay.   Calm down.

SHANE

Anyway, after that, I

could never seem to

adjust in the pros. I

was too scared. I lost

my balls.

ANNABELLE

Well, they're back.

SHANE

You know what I mean.

My nerve. I lost the

edge you need to play

this game.

ANNABELLE

I don't believe that.

I don't think it just

goes away. It was only

one bad day, Shane.

Everybody has those.

SHANE

No. Somehow, I

convinced myself that I

couldn't ever win the

big game. I got so

down, that I was afraid

to be playing when a

game was on the line.

I was afraid to screw

up. That's the sure

sign of a loser. From

there, it wasn't very

far to thinking that

I'll never win, that I

didn't deserve to win

at anything. Including

love.

ANNABELLE

You're wrong. You're

winning now. You're

winning me.

CUT TO:

REPORTER

Bob, I'm standing in

front of Redskins

owner, Edward Frances

O'Neil's home and all

we know right now is

that the Washington

player previously known

as Ray Smith is in fact

Earl Samuel

Wilkinson...

REPORTER (O.S.)

... the All Pro Miami

Safety who was serving

five to seven years in

the Maryland state

penitentiary for three

counts of aggravated

assault. As you may

recall, one of those

counts was against a

Baltimore City police

officer and resulted in

that officer being

hospitalized for quite

some time.

ANCHOR

Any idea how

Wilkinson's identity

was discovered and who

leaked it to the media?

REPORTER

No, Bob, but rumor has

it that the National

Football League

Player's Association

had something to do

with it.

ANCHOR

Thanks, Hank.

(TO CAMERA)

In other N.F.L. news,

almost sixty percent of

the regular players

have now crossed the

picket lines and more

are crossing every day.

The strike, now in its

second week, is

expected to go out with

a fizzle. Most experts

think that the Monday

night Dallas/Washington

game will be the last

with replacement

players. But even that

game will feature at

least 75 percent of the

regular Cowboys. Coach

James McGinty will try

to make it a perfect

three and O with a team

made up totally of

replacement players.

Well... and one felon.

(pause)

That we know of.

CUT TO:

McGINTY

Stop worrying. The

N.F.L. doesn't care if

he played under an

assumed name.

Everything was legal.

He was let out on a

work release program.

He'll be kept under

house arrest but he'll

still be able to play.

O'NEIL

Where are we gonna keep

him?

McGINTY

In the stadium. We'll

fix up something

comfortable for him and

he'll get his exercise

by kicking the shit out

of N.F.L. receivers.

O'NEIL

How did you pull that

off?

McGINTY

How else? With your

money.

O'NEIL

(to Augustine)

Take this cow piss out

of here.

AUGUSTINE

You used to love

asparagus soup. They

say that when the taste

buds go, you're at the

beginning of the end.

McGINTY

I want to keep Falco

after the strike ends.

As Martel's back-up.

O'NEIL

Let's keep 'em all.

The hell with the

regulars.

McGINTY

You've got to take the

union players back once

the strike ends. It's

part of the collective

bargaining agreement.

O'NEIL

The hell I do! I'm

dying! Let 'em sue me.

McGINTY

They'll do worse than

that. They'll close

down the stadium.

O'NEIL

God damn 'em! Then you

got to beat Dallas.

The whole country will

be watching. All those

millionaires down there

deserve to have their

noses rubbed in it.

McGINTY

Ed, let's be honest:

beating Dallas is gonna

be a hell of a trick.

O'NEIL

You can pull it    off.

You proved that    winning

doesn't have to    look

pretty. These     boys are

hungry for it,    Jimmy.

(MORE)

O'NEIL (CONT'D)

There's nothin' more

dangerous in all of

sports than a hungry

team. I remember back

in '47, we were playing

Nebraska in the mud...

McGINTY

(interrupting)

Ed, I'm begging you --

no Notre Dame stories.

O'NEIL

Okay, Jimmy, okay. But

you beat Dallas for me,

and then I'll go gently

into that night.

MARTEL

I used to nail one of

SHANE

Lucky girl.

MARTEL

(pointing to the

linemen)

You know who these guys

are, don't you?

SHANE

Dallas Cowboys.     Howdy.

MARTEL

You'll be seeing a lot

of these guys tomorrow.

SHANE

What do you want?

MARTEL

Who, me? Not much.

But these boys wanted a

little head start on

you.

SHANE

I'm flattered that you

actually think we have

a chance to win.

MARTEL

It can be a game of

luck. And under no

circumstances can we

allow a scab team to go

three and O.

Especially against the

Dallas Cowboys. It's

just not good for the

game.

SHANE

Is the union behind

this 'visit'?

MARTEL

I can't really say,

Shane. By the way,

have you ever tried

throwing a football

with bruised ribs?

MARTEL

The pain makes it damn

near impossible.

MARTEL

And one other thing: I

want you to stay away

from Annabelle.

MARTEL

The sad fact is she

won't give me the time

of day. But you can't

have everything I want.

I can't let that

happen. So, you gotta

stop seeing her. Just

on principle.

MARTEL

Let me hear you say it.

MARTEL

Come on. You can do

it.

SHANE

I won't go out with her

anymore.

MARTEL

Good.

Hey, have a great game!

I think that Mister

Matheson here, and

myself, are very close

to an agreement that

will put the 'pro' back

REPORTER

Mister Matheson, what

are the sticking points

in the negotiations as

far as the owners are

concerned?

MATHESON

Only one: that the

players immediately go

back to work with no

change in the existing

contract.

CUT TO:

AL

Good evening from the

Big O here in

Washington D.C. where

the mighty Dallas

Cowboys take on the

Cinderella Washington

'Scabskins' as they

have come to be known.

Hi, I'm Al Michaels and

we are witnesses to a

unique matchup tonight

as Shane Falco and a

contingent of strike

players go up against

the entire regular

squad of the Dallas

Cowboys. Yes, you

heard right: every

Cowboy has now crossed

the picket line, some

as late as this

afternoon, and they

will all play tonight.

Can a rag tag group of

hasbeens and castoffs

stand up to what was

once called America's

team? And what about

the strike itself? It

has been so ineffective

that many predict it

will be over before

this game ends. Stay

tuned as Boomer and Dan

join me for strike

ball, D.C. style.

CUT TO:

McGINTY

Congratulations. It's

official. You're

staying on after the

strike.

McGINTY

It's probably better

that you not say

anything to the rest of

the guys until after

the game. Okay?

SHANE

Whatever you say,

Coach.

McGINTY

Alright, listen up.

The strike is just

about history. By

tomorrow, you will no

longer be Redskins.

It's important that you

leave here, however,

with the knowledge that

you have made a

difference in your own

life, in the owner's

life -- or what's left

of it -- and especially

the fans'. You have

proven to a skeptical

America that sports is

not about contracts, or

agents or shoe deals.

Sports is about rising

to the occasion. We

have one more

opportunity tonight to

do that, one more

chance to show what

heart is all about.

The Dallas Cowboys are

waiting out there to

kill you. I expect

nothing less than for

you to win even in your

death throes. We have

a powerful weapon on

our side tonight:

there is no tomorrow

for most of you. And

that makes you very

dangerous people. Use

it.

CUT TO:

AL

That    is one    very big

leg    on Lou    Pacifico.

He's    a big    reason why

this    strike    team is two

and    0.

DAN

But the fact is, a

kicker does not an

offense make. I think

tonight the Scabskins

will have a very rude

awakening.

BOOMER

But you have to admit,

Dan, Falco is proving

to be the real thing.

DAN

Well, Boomer, no, I

don't have to admit

anything.

BOOMER

(rolling his

eyes)

Here we go...

CUT TO:

ANNABELLE

Shane!

COCHRAN

(to Butler)

I just want to say what

an honor it is to play

opposite you. And if

it's not too much

trouble, I would love

to have your autograph.

BUTLER

No problem.

SHANE (O.S.)

Hut!   Hut!

BUTLER

I'm gonna autograph

your body with bruises,

you scab-ass son of a

bitch!

CUT TO:

BUTLER

How's that side feel?

SHANE

(grimacing)

Like Christmas morning.

McGINTY

What's the matter with

your arm? Are you

alright?

DAN

What pursuit! Butler

never gave up on him.

That's a 270-pound guy

who moves like a

halfback.

BOOMER

Dan, I think Butler's

hit on Falco was late,

to tell you the truth.

DAN

Well, of course you do.

You were a wimp

Easy, guys.

CUT TO:

AL

That's the end of the

first half and not

surprisingly, it was

all Dallas. The

Cowboys had over two

hundred yards

offensively versus

Washington's frankly

pathetic thirty-eight

yards. That's total

offense. Falco got

close to scoring on the

last play of the half

but he appeared to have

slipped. By the way,

running back Roland

Lamont was hurt on that

play and word is he's

on his way to the

hospital.

DAN

Al, the battle is being

fought and won in the

trenches. You can't

expect a bunch of pick-

up players to stand up

to a professional pass

rush like the Cowboys.

BOOMER

There's still a whole

half left, Dan. And

remember, Falco is

proving to be a second-

half quarterback.

DAN

You got to be kidding.

BOOMER

Those big, fat boys in

the trenches get awful

tired. You ought to

know that, Dan.

AL

Okay, let's join Chris

Berman with our half-

time show. Chris?

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

Clear!

AL

What's wrong with you

guys?!

BOOMER

He started it.

DAN

I did not! You called

me fat!

BOOMER

I did not! But you

are!

AL

Stop it!

CUT TO:

McGINTY

Alright, listen up:

The strike is

officially over.

They're announcing it

on TV right now. So

this is it, gentlemen.

We have one half left

to keep from being

totally humiliated.

You are better than the

present score. You

have nothing but your

own self-respect riding

on this game. It's up

to you. Here's your

swan song, people. How

are you gonna sing it?

SHANE

I'm sorry, Roland.

That was a great block.

ROLAND

For my last play in

football, I'll take

that block.

ROLAND

I thought you were

going to score. What

happened? Did you

slip?

ROLAND

That's what I thought.

SHANE

You were a warrior,

Roland. I'm gonna miss

you.

ROLAND

It was a dream come

true. Go kick some ass

for me.

SID

Hey, Shane, I just

heard.

Congratulations!

WILKINSON

Congratulations on

what?

SID

Shane is staying on.

He's gonna be Martel's

backup.

ANDRE

Is that true?

SHANE

Yes, Andre. It's true.

FRANKLIN

I got to tell you,

Shane, you played the

first half like you

were staying. Like you

already had a contract.

SHANE

You're right, Clifford.

And I'm sorry. But now

I want to go out there

and either beat these

bastards or die trying.

I never wanted to beat

anybody so bad in my

life.

EARL

I don't know what yawl

are doin' tomorrow, but

my ass is goin' back to

jail. But if I gotta

go, I want to go back a

winner.

EVANS

Hell, I'm retiring. I

have thirty minutes of

football left in my

whole career. I'm

homicidal!

BATEMAN

Me, too, Reese!

EARL

Let's get it on!

SHANE

Gentlemen, our problem

is the Cowboys aren't

afraid of us. But they

should be!

LAMONT

Damn straight!

SHANE

We've got one chance on

offense to make our

stand -- the first play

of the half.

JAMAL

One touchdown ain't

gonna help, Shane.

SHANE

No.     But one nasty-ass

play    might. We just

gotta    be brave. And

trust    each other.

SHANE

Help me with this.

SHANE

Somebody has to tape me

up.

CUT TO:

AL (V.O.)

... at nine-forty

Eastern time, the

agreement was reached,

and except for this

upcoming second half,

the strike is history.

DAN

It's about time. I say

let the professionals

back on the field. The

fans deserve nothing

less.

BOOMER

Yeah, you would say

that.

ANNABELLE

Are you okay? Is it

your side?

SHANE

I'm okay. I owe you an

apology.

ANNABELLE

What?     You do?

SHANE

Yes. I'll explain

later. But thank you

for believing in me.

You give me strength

just looking at you.

AL (V.O.)

Well, this is a first.

Shane Falco seems to

be...

BOOMER (V.O.)

Hell,    Al, he's necking

supposed to fraternize

with the cheerleaders.

Absolutely, Al. The

Redskins are playing

like there's no

tomorrow, because, hey,

there isn't!

DAN (V.O.)

I gotta agree with you

on this one. The

surprising thing for me

is how ineffectual the

Cowboys have been in

this half. I mean,

they look totally

intimidated.

agree.

will be    leading the

DAN (V.O.)

They just need to get

the ball in field goal

range.

AL (V.O.)

And for Pacifico,

that's anything up to

sixty-five yards.

AL (V.O.)

That's good for twelve

yards. The clock stops

on the first down. The

Redskins have no time-

outs left.

McGINTY

I need your hands in

there for the field

goal. I can't trust

Franklin to hold. He

almost dropped the

extra point.

SHANE

I can do it.

AL (V.O.)

Wilkinson throws it

away, and with twelve

seconds remaining, the

Redskins will try a

forty-eight yard field

goal to tie it up.

That's almost a chip

shot for Pacifico.

Are you okay?

SHANE

Just make it a good

snap.
