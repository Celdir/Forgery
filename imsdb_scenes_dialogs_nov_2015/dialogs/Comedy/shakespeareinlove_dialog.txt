SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE

by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard

VOICE (O.S.)

You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it

is I who am bitten?

FENNYMAN

What am I, Mr. Lambert?

LAMBERT

Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

FENNYMAN

How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

FREES

Twelve pounds, one shilling and four

pence, Mr. Fennyman, including

interest.

HENSLOWE

Aaagh! I can pay you!

FENNYMAN

When?

HENSLOWE

Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh!

For pity's sake.

FENNYMAN

Take his feet out. Where will you get

FREES

(the mathematical genius with

a notebook)

Sixteen pounds, five shillings and

nine pence

FENNYMAN

including interest in three weeks?

HENSLOWE

I have a wonderful new play!

FENNYMAN

Put his feet in.

HENSLOWE

It's a comedy.

FENNYMAN

Cut his nose off.

HENSLOWE

A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!

FENNYMAN

And his ears.

HENSLOWE

And a share. We will be partners, Mr.

Fennyman!

FENNYMAN

(hesitating)

Partners!

HENSLOWE

It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken

identities, a shipwreck, a pirate

king, a bit with a dog, and love

triumphant.

LAMBERT

I think I've seen it. I didn't like

it.

HENSLOWE

This time it is by Shakespeare.

FENNYMAN

What's the title?

HENSLOWE

Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

FENNYMAN

Good title.

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

A play takes time. Find actors...

rehearsals...let's say open in three

weeks. That's--what--five hundred

groundlings at tuppence each, in

addition four hundred groundlings

tuppence each, in addition four

hundred backsides at three pence--a

penny extra for a cushion, call it two

hundred cushions, say two performance

for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?

FREES

Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr.

Fennyman.

FENNYMAN

Correct!

HENSLOWE

But I have to pay the actors and the

authors.

FENNYMAN

A share of the profits.

HENSLOWE

There's never any

FENNYMAN

Of course not!

HENSLOWE

(impressed)

Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit

on something.

FENNYMAN

Sign here.

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's

Daughter...Almost finished?

HENSLOWE

Without doubt he is completing it at

this very moment.

HENSLOWE

Will! Where is my play? Tell me you

have it nearly done! Tell me you have

it started.

(desperately)

You have begun?

WILL

(struggling with his boots)

Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt

that the sun doth move

HENSLOWE

No, no, we haven't the time. Talk

prose. Where is my play?

WILL

(tapping his forehead and

heading out the door)

It is all locked safe in here

HENSLOWE

God be praised!

(then doubt)

Locked?

WILL

As soon as I have found my muse

HENSLOWE

(catching up)

Who is she this time?!

WILL

She is always Aphrodite.

HENSLOWE

Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind

the Dog and Trumpet?

WILL

Henslowe, you have no soul so how can

you understand the emptiness that

seeks a soulmate?

HENSLOWE

Well, I am a dead man and buggered to

boot. My theatre is close by the

plague these twelve weeks, my company

is playing the inn-yards

of England, while Burbage and the

Chamberlain's Men are invited to court

and receive ten pounds to play your

piece, written for my theatre, by my

writer, at my risk when you were green

and grateful -

WILL

What piece? Richard Crookback?

HENSLOWE

No--it's comedy they want, Will!

Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?

WILL

Who wrote that?

HENSLOWE

Nobody! You are writing it for me! I

gave you three pounds a month since.

WILL

Half what you owed me. I am still due

for One Gentleman of Verona.

HENSLOWE

. . . Will! What is money to you and

me? I, your patron, you my wordwright!

When the plague lifts Burbage will

have a new Christopher Marlowe for the

Curtain and I have nothing for the

Rose.

WILL

Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty

pounds?

HENSLOWE

(staggered)

Fifty pounds? What for?

WILL

Burbage offers me a partnership in the

Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my

hired player days are over.

HENSLOWE

Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to

the dogs!

WILL

(answering for him)

No, then.

MAKEPEACE

and the Lord shall smite them! Yea,

harken to me. The theatres are

handmaidens of the devil! Under the

name of the Curtain, the players

breed lewdness in your wives,

rebellion in your servants, idleness

in your apprentices and wickedness in

your children! And the Rose smells

thusly rank by any name! I say a

plague on both their houses!

HENSLOWE

Where are you going?

WILL

To my weekly confession.

WILL

Words, words, words...once, I had the

gift...I could make love out of words as

a potter makes cups out of clay love

that overthrows empires, love that

binds two hearts together come

hellfire and brimstones...for sixpence a

line, I could cause a riot in a

nunnery...but now

DR. MOTH

And yet you tell me you lie with

women?

DR. MOTH (CONT'D)

Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline,

Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who

does it behind the Dog and

WILL

(interrupting)

Aye, now and again, but what of it? I

have lost my gift.

DR. MOTH

I am here to help you. Tell me in your

own words.

WILL

I have lost my gift.

(not finding this easy)

It's as if my quill is broken. As if

the organ of the imagination has dried

up. As if the proud tower of my genius

has collapsed.

DR. MOTH

Interesting.

WILL

Nothing comes.

DR. MOTH

Most interesting.

WILL

It is like trying to a pick a lock

with a wet herring.

DR. MOTH

(shrewdly)

Tell me, are you lately humbled in the

act of love?

DR. MOTH (CONT'D)

How long has it been?

WILL

A goodly length in times past, but

lately

DR. MOTH

No, no. You have a wife, children

LATER

Not much sand left.

WILL

I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway

was a woman, half as old again.

DR. MOTH

A woman of property?

WILL

(shrugs)

She had a cottage. One day, she was

three months gone with child, so

DR. MOTH

And your relations?

WILL

On my mother's side the Ardens

DR. MOTH

No, your marriage bed.

WILL

Four years and a hundred miles away in

Stratford.

A cold bed too, since the twins were

born. Banishment was a blessing.

DR. MOTH

So now you are free to love

WILL

yet cannot love nor write it.

DR. MOTH

Here is a bangle found in Psyche's

temple on Olympus cheap at four pence.

Write your name on a paper and feed it

in the snake.

WILL

Will it restore my gift?

DR. MOTH

The woman who wears the snake will

dream of you, and your gift will

return. Words will flow like a river.

I will see you in a week.

HENSLOWE

Now where? Will?

WILL

To the Palace at Whitehall.

WILL

(approaching)

Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You

too, good Crab.

KEMPE

Crab is nervous. He has never played

the Palace. When will you write me a

tragedy, Will? I could do it.

WILL

No, they would laugh at Seneca if you

played it.

BURBAGE

(to ROSALINE)

My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress

Rosaline, where were my seamstress's

eyes?

BURBAGE (CONT'D)

There is no dog in the first scene,

Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it

Will?

WILL

I am still owed money for this play,

Burbage.

BURBAGE

Not from me. I only stole it. When are

you coming over to the Chamberlain's

Men?

WILL

When I have fifty pounds.

BURBAGE

Are you writing?

WILL

(nods somewhat defensively)

A comedy. All but done, a pirate

comedy, wonderful.

BURBAGE

What is the chief part?

WILL

Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.

BURBAGE

The title?

WILL

Romeo

BURBAGE

I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.

WILL

It's for Henslowe. He paid me.

BURBAGE

How much?

WILL

Ten pounds.

BURBAGE

You're a liar.

WILL

I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and

the Admiral's Men.

BURBAGE

Ned is wrong for it.

BURBAGE (CONT'D)

(to WILL)

Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you

two more when you show me the pages.

WILL

Done.

HENSLOWE

(arriving)

Burbage, I will see you hanged for a

pickpocket.

BURBAGE

The Queen has commanded, she loves a

comedy and the Master of the Revels

favours us.

HENSLOWE

And what favour does Mr. Tilney

receive from you?

BURBAGE

Ask him.

TILNEY

She comes!

CONDELL AS VALENTINE

"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus;

Home-keeping youth have ever homely

wits..."

ROSALINE

When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

WILL

I have lost my gift.

ROSALINE

You left it in my bed. Come to look

for it again.

WILL

Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?

ROSALINE

Burbage has my keeping but you have my

heart.

WILL

You see? The consumptives plot against

me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let

us go and cough through it."

WILL

I feel a scene coming on.

HENSLOWE

Is it about a pirate's daughter?

HENSLOWE

You see? Comedy.

QUEEN

Well played, Master Crab, I commend

you.

HENSLOWE

Love and a bit with a dog, that's what

they like.

CONDELL AS VALENTINE

"What light is light if Silvia be not

seen?

What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?

Unless it be to think that she is by

And feed upon the shadow of

perfection..."

HENSLOWE

There's a lady knows your play by

heart.

VIOLA

Did you like Proteus or Valentine

best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine

for looks.

NURSE

I liked the dog, for laughs.

VIOLA

But Silvia I did not care for much.

His fingers were red from fighting and

he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

Stage love will never be true love

while the law of the land has our

heroines played by pipsqueak boys in

petticoats! Oh, when can we see

another?

NURSE

When the Queen commands it.

VIOLA

But at the playhouse. Nurse?

NURSE

Be still.

NURSE (CONT'D)

Playhouses are not for well-born

ladies.

VIOLA

I am not so well-born.

NURSE

Well-monied is the same as well-born

and well-married is more so. Lord

Wessex was looking at you tonight.

VIOLA

All the men at court are without

poetry. If they look at me they see my

father's fortune. I will have poetry

in my life. And adventure. And love.

Love above all.

NURSE

Like Valentine and Silvia?

VIOLA

No . . . not the artful postures of

love, but love that over- throws life.

Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot

in the heart, and nothing to be done,

come ruin or rapture. Love like there

has never been in a play.

(beat)

I will have love or I will end my days

as a . . .

NURSE

As a nurse.

VIOLA

(kissing her)

But I would be Valentine and Silvia

too. Good Nurse, God save you and good

night. I would stay asleep my whole

life if I could dream myself into a

company of players.

NURSE

Clean your teeth while you dream,

then.

NURSE (CONT'D)

Now spit

FENNYMAN

This time we take your boots off!

HENSLOWE

What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

FENNYMAN

The theatres are all closed by the

plague!

HENSLOWE

Oh, that.

FENNYMAN

by order of the Master of the Revels!

HENSLOWE

Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the

theatre business.

(they stop)

The natural condition is one of

insurmountable obstacles on the road

to imminent disaster. Believe me, to

be close by the plague is a bagatelle

in the ups and downs of owning a

theatre.

FENNYMAN

So what do we do?

HENSLOWE

Nothing. Strangely enough , it all

turns out well.

FENNYMAN

How?

HENSLOWE

I don't know. It's a mystery.

LAMBERT

(dumbly)

Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

MESSENGER

The theatres are reopened. By order of

the Master of the Revels, the theatres

are reopened

FREES

Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened

the playhouses.

FENNYMAN

Yes I heard.

HENSLOWE

(to LAMBERT)

If you wouldn't mind

FENNYMAN

Where is the play?

HENSLOWE

Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

HENSLOWE

Will! The theatres are

WILL

Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God,

I'm good!

HENSLOWE

Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

WILL

(shouting)

Richard!

WILL

Burbage?

WILL

Mr. Tilney

TILNEY

Like you, I found him not at home!

WILL

So this is the favour you find in the

Chamberlain's Men.

ROSALINE

Will!

WILL

(to ROSALINE)

I would have made you immortal.

(turning to go)

Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by

Will Shakespeare.

TILNEY

What does Burbage care of that? He is

readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

WILL

You have opened the playhouses?

TILNEY

I have, Master Shakespeare.

WILL

But the plague

TILNEY

(sighs)

Yes, I know. But he was always hanging

around the house.

ROSALINE

(to WILL, leaving)

Will...you're the only one, Will!--in my

heart.

NOL

(excitedly)

Mr. Henslowe!

HENSLOWE

Yes, I heard. The theatres are open.

But where is my playwright?

HENSLOWE

Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.

NOL

The special today is a pig's foot

marinated in juniper-berry vinegar,

served with a buckwheat pancake which

has been

HENSLOWE

Will! Have you finished?

WILL

Yes. Nearly.

(he taps his forehead)

It's all locked safe in here. We need

Ralph for the Pirate King. Good

morning, Master Nol. You will have a

nice little part.

HENSLOWE

Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are

out on tour. I need actors. Those here

who are unknown will have a chance to

be known.

ACTOR

What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?

HENSLOWE

It won't cost you a penny! Auditions

in half-an-hour!

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for

you but, alas, I hear you are a

drunkard's drunkard.

RALPH

Never when I'm working.

WILL

Give me to drink mandragora.

BARMAN

Straight up, Will?

VOICE

Give my friend a beaker of your best

brandy.

WILL

Kit

MARLOWE

How goes it, Will?

WILL

Wonderful, wonderful.

MARLOWE

Burbage says you have a play.

WILL

I have. And chinks to show for it.

WILL (CONT'D)

I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

The BARMAN does the business.

WILL (CONT'D)

I hear you have a new play for the

Curtain.

MARLOWE

Not new--my Doctor Faustus.

WILL

I love your early work. "Was this the

face that launched a thousand ships

and burnt the topless towers of

Ilium?"

MARLOWE

I have a new one nearly done, and

better. The Massacre at Paris.

WILL

Good title.

MARLOWE

And yours?

WILL

Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

(beat, sighs despondently)

Yes, I know.

MARLOWE

What is the story?

WILL

Well, there's a pirate

(confesses)

In truth, I have not written a word.

MARLOWE

Romeo is...Italian. Always in and out of

love.

WILL

Yes, that's good. Until he meets

MARLOWE

Ethel.

WILL

Do you think?

MARLOWE

The daughter of his enemy.

WILL

(thoughtfully)

The daughter of his enemy.

MARLOWE

His best friend is killed in a duel by

Ethel's brother or something. His name

is Mercutio.

WILL

Mercutio...good name.

NOL

Will--they're waiting for you!

WILL

I'm coming.

WILL (CONT'D)

Good luck with yours, Kit.

MARLOWE

I thought your play was for Burbage.

WILL

This is a different one.

MARLOWE

(trying to work it out)

A different one you haven't written?

YOUNG ACTOR

" ...Was this the face that launched a

thousand ships, And burnt the topless

towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me

immortal with a kiss!"

HENSLOWE

Thank you.

SECOND ACTOR

I would like to give you something

from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

HENSLOWE

How refreshing.

SECOND ACTOR

"Was this the face that launched a

thousand ships, And burnt the topless

towers of Ilium?"

URCHIN

"...the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet

Helen, make me immortal with a--?"

HENSLOWE

(bellows)

Thank you!

WABASH

"W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-

f-face..."

HENSLOWE

(unexpectedly)

Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent.

Report to the property master.

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

(apologetically)

My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I

have a few debts here and there. Well,

that seems to be everybody. Did you

see a Romeo?

WILL

I did not.

HENSLOWE

Well, I to my work, you to yours. When

can I see pages?

WILL

Tomorrow

WILL (CONT'D)

(a prayer)

please God.

ACTOR

May I begin, sir?

WILL

Your name?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Thomas Kent. I would like to do a

speech by a writer who commands the

heart of every player.

VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)

"What light is light, if Silvia be not

seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be

not by? Unless it be to think that she

is by And feed upon the shadow of

perfection.

VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)

" ...except I be by Silvia in the night,

There is no music in the nightingale.

Unless I look on Silvia in the day,

There is no day for me to look upon."

WILL

Take off your hat.

VIOLA AS THOMAS

My hat?

WILL

Where did you learn how to do that?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

I . . .

WILL

Wait there.

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Are you Mr. Shakespeare?

WILL

Let me see you. Take off your hat.

ACTOR

What are we playing?

NOL

Where are the pages?

WILL

(shouts)

Where's the boy?

WABASH

B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!

WILL

Follow that boat!

BOATMAN

Right you are, governor!

BOATMAN (CONT'D)

I know your face. Are you an actor?

WILL

(oh God, here we go again)

Yes.

BOATMAN

Yes, I've seen you in something. That

one about a king.

WILL

Really?

BOATMAN

I had the Christopher Marlowe in my

boat once.

WILL

Do you know that house?

BOATMAN

Sir Robert De Lesseps.

LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D)

Tomorrow he drags me off to the

country and it will be three weeks

gone before we return from our

estates.

VIOLA

God save you, mother.

(to NURSE)

Ho water, nurse.

SCULLERY MAID (O.S.)

Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.

WILL (O.S.)

The actor

NURSE

Who asks for him?

WILL

William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and

playwright of the Rose.

NURSE

Master Kent is...my nephew.

WILL

(giving her the letter)

I will wait.

NURSE

Much god may it do you.

VIOLA

(delighted)

He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague,

a young man of Verona.

NURSE

(unimpressed)

Verona again.

VIOLA

(devouring the letter)

A comedy of quarreling families

reconciled in the discovery of Romeo

to be the very same Capulet cousin

stolen from the cradle and fostered to

manhood by his Montague mother that

was robbed of her own child by the

Pirate King!

SERVANT

Be off!

NURSE

Your mother, and your father

VIOLA

(gaily)

From tomorrow, away in the country for

three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not

handsome?

NURSE

He looks well enough for a mountebank.

VIOLA

Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent

the life of Viola De Lesseps's

dreaming.

NURSE

(firmly)

My lady, this play will end badly. I

will tell.

VIOLA

(twice as firmly)

You will not tell. As you love me and

as I love you, you will bind my breast

and buy me a boy's wig!

WILL

Master Plum! What business here?

MUSICIAN

A five shilling business, Will. We

play for the dancing.

SERVANT

Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's

orders.

WILL

I seek Master Thomas Kent.

SIR ROBERT

She is a beauty, my lord, as would

take a king to church for a dowry of a

nutmeg.

WESSEX

My plantations in Virginia are not

mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an

ancient name that will bring you

preferment when your grandson is a

Wessex. Is she fertile?

SIR ROBERT

She will breed. If she do not, send

her back.

WESSEX

Is she obedient?

SIR ROBERT

As any mule in Christendom. But if you

are the man to rider her, their are

rubies in the saddlebag.

WESSEX

I like her.

WILL

(to Musician)

By all the stars in heaven, who is

she?

MUSICIAN

Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.

VIOLA

Master Shakespeare

WESSEX

My lady Viola.

VIOLA

My lord.

WESSEX

I have spoken with your father.

VIOLA

So my lord? I speak with him every

day.

VIOLA (CONT'D)

Good sir... ?

VIOLA (CONT'D)

I heard you are a poet.

VIOLA (CONT'D)

But a poet of no words?

WESSEX

(smiling evilly)

"Poet?"

WILL

(coming round form the

anaesthetic and not noticing

the danger)

I was a poet till now, but I have seen

beauty that puts my poems at one with

the talking ravens at the Tower.

WILL (CONT'D)

(startled)

How do I offend, my lord?

WESSEX

By coveting my property. I cannot shed

blood in her house but I will cut your

throat anon. You have a name?

WILL

(gulps)

Christopher Marlowe at your service.

VIOLA

Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of

Verona. A comedy. By William

Shakespeare.

WILL

(whispers)

My lady!

VIOLA

(gasps)

Who is there?

WILL

Will Shakespeare!

VIOLA

Anon, good nurse. Anon.

(to WILL)

Master Shakespeare?!

WILL

The same, alas.

VIOLA

Oh but why "alas?"

WILL

A lowly player.

VIOLA

Alas indeed, for I thought you the

highest poet of my esteem and a writer

of plays that capture my heart.

WILL

Oh--I am him too!

VIOLA

(to NURSE)

Anon, anon!

(to WILL)

I will come again.

WILL

(to himself)

Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be

punished for this!

WILL (CONT'D)

Oh my lady, my love!

VIOLA

If they find you here they will kill

you.

WILL

You can bring them with a word.

VIOLA

Oh, not for the world!

VIOLA (CONT'D)

Anon, nurse!

JOHN

"Draw if you be men!

(to JAMES)

Gregory, remember thy washing blow."

NOL

"Part, fools, put up your swords."

HENSLOWE

It starts well, and then it's all long-

faced about some Rosaline. Where's the

comedy, Will. Where's the dog?

(to RALPH)

Do you think it is funny?

RALPH

I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse.

That's funny

WILL

We are at least six men short, and

those we have will be overparted,

ranters and stutterers who should be

sent back to the stews. My Romeo has

let me down. I see disaster.

HENSLOWE

We are at least four acts short, Will,

if you are looking for disaster.

WILL

Who are you, master?

URCHIN

I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's

daughter.

WILL

(furiously)

I'll be damned if you are!

FENNYMAN

Is it going well?

HENSLOWE

Very well.

FENNYMAN

But nothing is happening.

HENSLOWE

Yes, but very well.

WILL

(shouts)

Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.

FENNYMAN

Who is that?

HENSLOWE

Nobody. The author.

WILL

We are about to embark on a great

voyage.

HENSLOWE

It is customary to make a little

speech on the first day. It does no

harm and authors like it.

WILL

You want to know what parts you are to

receive. All will be settled as we go

ALLEYN

Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned

to the house!

FENNYMAN

Who is this?

ALLEYN

(roars)

Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am

Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am

Barrabas, the Jew of Malta--of yes,

Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What

is the play, and what is my part?

FENNYMAN

A moment, sir!

ALLEYN

(roars)

Who are you?

FENNYMAN

(bleating)

I am the money!

ALLEYN

Then you may remain so long as you

remain silent. Pay attention and you

will see how genius creates a legend.

FENNYMAN

(respectfully)

Thank you, sir.

WILL

We are in desperate want of a

Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of

Verona

ALLEYN

And the title of this piece?

WILL

Mercutio

HENSLOWE

Is it?

ALLEYN

I will play him!

WILL

Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome,

George Bryan! James Armitage!

(and now greeting SAM GOSSE,

the female star of the

Admiral's Men)

Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to

fall in love again?

SAM

(hoarsely)

I am, Master Shakespeare.

WILL

(concerned)

But your voice

(he thrust a hand between

SAM'S legs)

Have they dropped?

SAM

(a girlie voice now)

No, no, a touch of cold only. We

suspect he is lying but WILL has

turned away.

WILL

Master Henslowe, you have your actors.

FENNYMAN

I saw his Tamburlaine, you know.

Wonderful.

WILL

Yes, I saw it.

FENNYMAN

Of course, it was mighty writing.

There is no one like Marlowe

WILL

Better fortune, boy.

URCHIN

(shrugs)

I was in a play. They cut my head off

in Titus Andronicus. When I write

plays, they will be like Titus.

WILL

(pleased)

You admire it?

URCHIN

I like it when they cut heads off. And

the daughter mutilated with knives.

WILL

Oh. What is your name?

URCHIN.

John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.

URCHIN (CONT'D)

Plenty of blood. That is the only

writing.

URCHIN (CONT'D)

Wait, you'll see the cat bites his

head off.

WILL

I have to get back.

MONTAGUE

"I would thou wert so happy by thy

stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam,

let's away."

WILL

Cut round him for now.

HENSLOWE

(not understanding)

What? Who?

WILL

Romeo.

HENSLOWE

The one who came with your letter?

WILL

What?

NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.)

"Good morrow, cousin."

VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.)

"Is the day so young?"

NOL AS BENVOLIO

"But new struck nine."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that

my father that went hence so fast?"

NOL AS BENVOLIO

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's

hours?"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Not having that which, having, makes

them short."

WILL

Good

NOL AS BENVOLIO

"In love?"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Out."

NOL AS BENVOLIO

"Of love?"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Out of her favour where I am in

love."

WILL

(interrupting)

No, no, no...Don't spend it all at once!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Yes, sir.

WILL

Do you understand me?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

No, sir.

WILL

He is speaking about a baggage we

never even meet! What will be left in

your purse when he meets his Juliet?

HENSLOWE

Juliet? You mean Ethel.

WILL

(rounding on him)

God's teeth, am I to suffer this

constant stream of interruption?!

(to THOMAS)

What will you do in Act Two when he

meets the love of his life?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(timidly--looking through his

few sheets of paper)

I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen

Act Two.

WILL

Of course you have not! I have not

written it!

WILL (CONT'D)

Go once more!

ALLEYN

Will...Where is Mercutio?

WILL

(tapping his forehead)

Locked safe in here. I leave the scene

in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a

sonnet to write.

HENSLOWE

A sonnet? You mean a play.

WESSEX

Two hours at prayer!

NURSE

Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

WESSEX

Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at

prayer is not piety, it is self-

importance!

NURSE

It would be better that you return

tomorrow, my lord.

WESSEX

It would be better that you tell her

to get off her knees and show some

civility to her six-day lord and

master.

WESSEX (CONT'D)

My lady VIOLA.

VIOLA

Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.

WESSEX

I am aware of it, but it is beauty's

privilege.

VIOLA

You flatter, my lord.

WESSEX

No. I have spoken to the Queen.

(pause)

Her majesty's consent is requisite

when a Wessex takes a wife, and once

gained, her consent is her command.

VIOLA

Do you intend to marry, my lord?

WESSEX

Your father should keep you better

informed. He has bought me for you. He

returns from his estates to see us

married two weeks from Saturday.

(pause)

You are allowed to show your pleasure.

VIOLA

I do not love you, my lord.

WESSEX

How your mind hops about! Your father

was a shopkeeper, your children will

bear arms, and I will recover my

fortune. That is the only matter under

discussion today. You will like

Virginia.

VIOLA

Virginia?!

WESSEX

Why, yes! My fortune lies in my

plantations. The tobacco weed. I need

four thousand pounds to fit out a ship

and put my investments to work--I fancy

tobacco has a future. We will not stay

there long, three or four years . . .

VIOLA

But why me?

WESSEX

It was your eyes. No, your lips.

WESSEX (CONT'D)

Will you defy your father and your

Queen?

VIOLA

The Queen has consented?

WESSEX

She wants to inspect you. At

Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive,

modest, grateful and brief.

VIOLA

(forced to submit)

I will do my duty, my lord.

ALLEYN

Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!

ALLEYN (CONT'D)

(furious)

Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage!

Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?

WILL

(preempting)

You did not like the speech?

ALLEYN

The speech is excellent.

(he does the first line

impressively)

"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been

with you!" Excellent and a good

length. But then he disappears for the

length of a bible.

WILL

There you have his duel, a skirmish of

words and swords such as I never

wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such

passion and poetry as your ever heard:

"a plague on both your houses!"

ALLEYN

He dies?

BURBAGE

Will!

BURBAGE (CONT'D)

And where are my pages . . .

WILL

(O.S. shouting)

Did you give her my letter?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(calling)

And this for you.

WILL

Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I

am unmanned, unmended, and unmade,

like a puppet in a box.

BOATMAN

Writer, is he?

WILL

Row your boat.

WILL

She tells me to keep away. She is to

marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

If you love her, you must do what she

asks.

WILL

And break her heart and mine?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

It is only ours you can know.

WILL

She loves me, Thomas!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Does she say so?

WILL

No. And yet she does where the ink has

run with tears. Was she weeping when

she gave you this?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

I ... Her letter came to me by the

nurse.

WILL

Your aunt?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(catching up)

Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a

little. Tell me how you love her,

Will.

WILL

Like a sickness and its cure together.

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and

heat.

(collecting herself)

Is your lady beautiful? Since I came

to visit from the country, I have not

seen her close. Tell me, is she

beautiful?

WILL

Oh, if I could write the beauty of her

eyes! I was born to look in them and

know myself.

VIOLA AS THOMAS

And her lips?

WILL

Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early

morning rose would wither on the

branch, if it could feel envy!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

And her voice? Like lark song?

WILL

Deeper. Softer. None of your

twittering larks! I would banish

nightingales from her garden before

they interrupt her song.

VIOLA AS THOMAS

She sings too?

WILL

Constantly. Without doubt. And plays

the lute, she has a natural ear. And

her bosom--did I mention her bosom?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(glinting)

What of her bosom?

WILL

Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round

and rare as golden apples!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

I think the lady is wise to keep your

love at a distance. For what lady

could live up to it close to, when her

eyes and lips and voice may be no more

beautiful than mine? Besides, can a

lady born to wealth and noble marriage

love happily with a Bankside poet and

player?

WILL

(fervently)

Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of

rank or riverbank! It will spark

between a queen and the poor vagabond

who plays the king, and their love

should be minded by each, for love

denied blights the soul we owe to God!

So tell my lady, William Shakespeare

waits for her in the garden!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

But what of Lord Wessex?

WILL

For one kiss, I would defy a thousand

Wessexes!

VIOLA

Oh, Will!

BOATMAN

Thank you, my lady!

WILL

(stunned)

Lady?

BOATMAN

Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she

was this high. Wouldn't deceive a

child.

BOATMAN (CONT'D)

(reaching under his seat)

Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a

writer myself.

BOATMAN (CONT'D)

It wouldn't take you long to read it,

I expect you know all the booksellers

. . .

WILL

Can you love a fool?

VIOLA

Can you love a player?

WILL

(springs back)

Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps

as mistook in me as I was mistook in

Thomas Kent.

VIOLA

Answer me only this: are you the

author of the plays of William

Shakespeare?

WILL

I am.

VIOLA

Then kiss me again for I am not

mistook.

VIOLA (CONT'D)

I do not know how to undress a man.

WILL

It is strange to me, too.

NURSE

Go to, go to.

VIOLA

I would not have thought it. There is

something better than a play.

WILL

There is.

VIOLA

Even your play.

WILL

(frowns)

Oh

VIOLA

And that was only my first try.

WILL

Well perhaps better than my first.

(he kisses her again)

VIOLA

Will

VIOLA (CONT'D)

You would not leave me?

WILL

I must. Look-- how pale the window.

VIOLA

(pulling him down)

Moonlight!

WILL

No, the morning rooster woke me.

VIOLA

It was the owl--come to bed

WILL

(giving in)

Oh, let Henslowe wait.

VIOLA

(pausing, pushing him away)

Mr. Henslowe?

WILL

(persisting)

Let him be damned for his pages!

VIOLA

Oh--no, no!

WILL

(kissing her)

There is time. It is still dark.

VIOLA

It is broad day!

(the rooster crows again)

The rooster tells us so!

WILL

It was the owl. Believe me, love, it

was the owl.

VIOLA

You would leave us players without a

scene to read today?!

NURSE

My lady, the house is stirring, it is

a new day.

VIOLA

It is a new world!

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"...Have not saints lips, and holy

palmers too?"

SAM AS JULIET

"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use

in prayer."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what

hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest

faith turn to despair."

SAM AS JULIET

"Saints do not move, though grant for

prayer's sake."

SAM

(prompting her)

It's you.

ALLEYN

(roars)

Suffering cats!

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Then move not, while my prayer's

effect I take."

VIOLA AS ROMEO(CONT'D)

"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin

is purg'd."

SAM AS JULIET

"Then have my lips the sin that they

have took."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly

urg'd. Give me my sin again."

WILL

Yes...yes...er...not quite right...it is more

let me

(as JULIET)

"Then have my lips the sin that they

have took."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly

urg'd. Give me my sin again."

VIOLA AS ROMEO (CONT'D)

"You kiss by th' book."

ALLEYN

(to Will, sarcastically)

Well! It was lucky you were here! Why

do not I write the rest of your play

while you

WILL

(apologising, retreating)

Yes, yes...continue. Now the Nurse.

Where is Ralph?

RALPH AS NURSE

"Madam, your mother craves a word with

you."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"What is her mother?"

RALPH AS NURSE

"Marry bachelor, Her mother is the

lady of the house..."

RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)

"...And a good lady, and wise and

virtuous. I nurse her daughter that

you talk'd withal..."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My

life is my foe's debt."

NOL AS BENVOLIO

(to ROMEO)

"Away, be gone, the sport is at best."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Ay, so I fear; the more is my

unrest."

SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)

"Come hither nurse. What is yond

gentleman?"

VIOLA

(to Will)

Oh let it be night!

RALPH AS NURSE

"I know not."

SAM AS JULIET

"Go ask his name--If he be married, My

grave is like to be my wedding bed."

VIOLA

Oh, do not go

WILL

I must. I must

RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)

"His name is Romeo, and a Montague,

The only son of your great enemy."

ALLEYN (O.S.)

(roaring from the audience)

Terrible!

VIOLA (VO)

"But soft, what light through yonder

window breaks? It is the east and

Juliet is the sun!"

VIOLA

(reading)

"Arise fair sun and kill the envious

moon Who is already sick and pale with

grief That thou her maid art far more

fair than she..."

VIOLA (CONT'D)

Oh, Will!

WILL

Yes, some of it is speakable.

VIOLA

(continuing reading)

"It is my lady, O it is my love! O

that she knew she were!"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"The brightness of her cheek would

shame those stars As daylight doth a

lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through

the airy region stream so bright That

birds would sing and think it were not

night. See how she leans her cheek

upon her hand. O that I were a glove

upon that hand, That I might touch

that cheek.

SAM AS JULIET

(above)

"Ay me."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"She speaks.

WILL

(reading through VIOLA'S

kisses)

"Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou

Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy

name."

SAM AS JULIET

"Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my

love And I'll no longer be a Capulet."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

(below)

"Shall I hear more or shall I speak at

this?"

WILL

"What man art thou that thus

bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my

counsel?"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"...By a name I know not how to tell

thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is

hateful to myself Because it is an

enemy to thee..."

WILL

"The orchard walls are high and hard

to climb, And the place death,

considering who thou art, If any of my

kinsmen find thee here. If they do see

thee, they will murder thee."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Alack, there lies more peril in thine

eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look

thou but sweet, And I am proof against

their enmity."

SAM AS JULIET

I would not for the world!

VIOLA AS ROMEO

I have night's cloak to hide me from

their eyes; And but thou love me, let

them find me here.

WILL

"Good night, good night. As sweet

repose and rest Come to thy heart as

that within my breast. O wilt thou

leave me so unsatisfied?"

VIOLA

That's my line!

WILL

Oh, but it is mine too!

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"

SAM AS JULIET

"What satisfaction can'st thou have

tonight?"

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"The exchange of thy love's faithful

vow for mine."

WILL

"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

My love as deep:

VIOLA AND WILL

(continuing the speech with

him)

the more I give to thee The more I

have, for both are infinite."

SAM AS JULIET

"I hear some noise within. Dear love,

adieu."

VIOLA

(calling to the NURSE who is

outside)

Anon, good Nurse

SAM AS JULIET

"Anon, good Nurse--Sweet Montague be

true."

WILL

"Stay but a little, I will come

again."

SAM AS JULIET

"Stay but a little, I will come

again."

VIOLA AS ROMEO

"Oh blessed blessed night."

VIOLA

(almost to herself)

"I am feared,

SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)

"...All my fortunes at thy foot I'll

lay, And follow thee my lord

throughout the world."

RALPH AS NURSE

"Madam!"

SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)

"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not

well, I do beseech thee--"

RALPH AS NURSE

"Madam!"

SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)

By and by I come to cease thy strife

and leave me to my grief. A thousand

times good night!"

SAM

(to NED)

I cannot move in this dress! and it

makes me look like a pig! I have no

neck in this pig dress!

(and then hearing his cue

from "ROMEO")

Oh, she's off again! She says she's

going and then she doesn't

WILL

(to PETER)

How is it?

PETER

(shrugs)

It's all right.

WILL

Ned...I know...I know

ALLEYN

It's good.

WILL

Oh

ALLEYN

The title won't do.

WILL

Ah

ALLEYN

Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

WILL

Thank you, Ned.

WILL (CONT'D)

You are a gentleman.

ALLEYN

And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

HENSLOWE

(in disbelief)

You mean, no dog of any kind?

PETER

(to HENSLOWE)

The Friar married them in secret, then

Ned gets into a fight with one of the

Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he

gets in Ned's way, I mean in

Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills

Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt.

Then the Prince banishes him from

Verona.

HENSLOWE

(much relieved)

That must be when he goes on the

voyage and gets shipwrecked on the

island of the Pirate King.

FENNYMAN

Cease your prattling! Get out!

(to the stage where the

action has paused)

A thousand apologies!

SAM AS JULIET

"Good night, good night. Parting is

such sweet sorrow That I shall say

good night till it be morrow."

WILL

Sunday...it is Sunday.

WILL (CONT'D)

I found something in my sleep. The

Friar who married them will take up

their destinies.

VIOLA

Oh, but it will end well for love?

WILL

In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy

I am writing now. A broad river

divides my lovers--family, duty,

fate--as unchangeable as nature.

VIOLA

(sobered)

Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a

stolen season.

WESSEX (O.S.)

Not ready? Where is she?

NURSE (O.S.)

Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

WESSEX (O.S.)

Will you ask Her Majesty to be

patient?!

VIOLA

Sunday! Greenwich!

WESSEX

Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen,

Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel,

the Radiant One, who shines her light

on us, is at Greenwich today, and

prepared, during the evening's

festivities, to bestow her gracious

favour on my choice of wife--and if

we're late for lunch, the old boot

will not forgive. So you get you to my

lady's chamber and produce her with or

without her undergarments.

WILL

You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!

VIOLA

What will you have me do? Marry you

instead?

WILL

(brought up short)

To be the wife of a poor player?--can I

wish that for Lady Viola, except in my

dreams? And yet I would, if I were

free to follow my desire in the harsh

light of day.

VIOLA

(tartly)

You follow your desire freely enough

in the night. So, if that is all, to

Greenwich I go.

WILL

Then I will go with you.

VIOLA

You cannot, Wessex will kill you

WILL

I know how to fight!

VIOLA

(now fixing her hair)

Stage fighting!

(turn to him)

Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart

belongs to you but as Viola the river

divides us, and I will marry Wessex a

week from Saturday.

WESSEX

(ranting)

By heaven, I will drag her down, by

the Queen's command

VIOLA

Good morning, my lord!

WESSEX

(impressed by her appearance)

Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no

man, but I swear it would wait for

you!

WILL

Here we come at last, my lord!

WESSEX

(taken aback)

Are you bringing your laundry woman?

WILL

Her chaperone. My lady's country

cousin.

(arriving with a curtsey)

My, but you be a handsome gallant,

just as she said! You may call me Miss

Wilhelmina!

WESSEX

On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps

WILL

Oh, my lord, you will not shake me

off, she never needed me more, I sear

by your breeches!

WESSEX

(to him)

Now?

LORD IN WAITING

Now.

WESSEX

(to Viola)

The Queen asks for you. Answer well.

WESSEX (CONT'D)

Is there a man?

WILL

A man, my lord?

WESSEX

(impatiently)

There was a man, poet--a theatre poet,

I heard--does he come to the house?

WILL

A theatre poet?

WESSEX

An insolent penny-a-page rogue,

Marlowe, he said, Christopher

Marlowe--has he been to the house?

WILL

Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely

waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

WESSEX

(venomously)

That dog!

VIOLA

Your Majesty.

QUEEN

Stand up straight, girl.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

I have seen you. You are the one who

comes to all the plays--at Whitehall,

at Richmond.

VIOLA

(agreeing)

Your Majesty.

QUEEN

What do you love so much?

VIOLA

Your Majesty

QUEEN

Speak out! I know who I am. Do you

love stories of kings and queens?

Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?

VIOLA

I love theatre. To have stories acted

for me by a company of fellows is

indeed

QUEEN

(interrupting)

They are not acted for you, they are

acted for me.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

And--?

VIOLA

And I love poetry above all.

QUEEN

Above Lord Wessex?

QUEEN (CONT'D)

(to WESSEX)

My Lord--when you cannot find your wife

you had better look for her at the

playhouse.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

But playwrights teach nothing about

love, they make it pretty, they make

it comical, or they make it lust. They

cannot make it true.

VIOLA

(blurts)

Oh, but they can!

VIOLA (CONT'D)

I mean...Your Majesty, they do not, they

have not, but I believe there is one

who can

WESSEX

Lady Viola is...young in the world. Your

Majesty is wise in it.

Nature and truth are the very enemies

of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

QUEEN

I thought you were here because you

had none.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

(by way of dismissing him)

Well, no one will take your wager, it

seems.

WILL

Fifty pounds!

QUEEN

Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a

very worthy question. Can a play show

us the very truth and nature of love?

I bear witness to the wager, and will

be the judge of it as occasion arises.

(which wins a scatter of

applause. She gathers her

skirts and stands)

I have not seen anything to settle it

yet.

(she moves away, everybody

bowing and scraping)

So--the fireworks will be soothing

after the excitements of Lady Viola's

audience.

(and now she is next to

WESSEX who is bowing low.

Intimately to him)

Have her then, but you are a lordly

fool. She has been plucked since I saw

her last, and not by you. It takes a

woman to know it.

WESSEX

(to himself)

Marlowe!

MARLOWE

Burbage!

BURBAGE'S VOICE

Who's there?

MARLOWE

Marlowe.

BURBAGE'S VOICE

Kit!

MARLOWE

You are playing my Faustus this

afternoon. Don't spend yourself in

sport.

ROSALINE

(working hard)

This afternoon!--we'll still be here

this afternoon.

BURBAGE

What do you want, Kit?

MARLOWE

My Massacre at Paris is complete.

BURBAGE

You have the last act?

MARLOWE

You have the money?

BURBAGE

Tomorrow.

MARLOWE

(leaving)

Then tomorrow you will have the pages.

BURBAGE

Wait!

(to ROSALINE)

Will you desist!

MARLOWE

Twenty pounds on delivery

BURBAGE

What is money to me like us? Besides,

if I need a play, I have another

waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

MARLOWE

Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

BURBAGE

Never!

MARLOWE

Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my

respects, Miss Rosaline.

BURBAGE

I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for

Romeo!

MARLOWE

(leaving)

You did. But Ned Alleyn and the

Admiral's Men have the playing of it

as the Rose.

BURBAGE

Treachery!

BURBAGE (CONT'D)

Traitor and thief!

NOL AS BENVOLIO

"By my head, here comes the Capulets."

ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO

"By my heel, I care not."

JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT

"Follow me close, for I will speak to

them. (with bombast to "MERCUTIO")

Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one

of you."

ALLEYN

Are you going to do it like that? And

before the humbled actor can reply NED

continues.

ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)

And but one word with one of us?

Couple it with something, make it a

word and a blow.

BURBAGE

Where is that thieving hack who can't

keep his pen in his own ink pot!?

WILL

What is this rabble?!

FENNYMAN

(to HENSLOWE)

Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!

HENSLOWE

Not with my props!

VIOLA

Will! What--?

WILL

A literary feud. Quite normal.

WILL (CONT'D)

Stay hid!

WILL

I dreamed last night of a shipwreck.

You were cast ashore in a far country.

HENSLOWE

We need that for the balcony scene!

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

(in despair)

My poor Rose!

FENNYMAN

(horrified)

My investment! LAMBERT!!!

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

(points at the fray)

VENGEANCE!

HENSLOWE

I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman.

As I explained to you, the theatre

business

FENNYMAN

Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my

business I would be out of business if

I had your courage, so don't tell me

about business

FENNYMAN

(shouts)

A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open

and on the house! Oh what happy hour!

(and grabbing a RADDLED

WHORE)

Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to

yourself I'll not have you infecting

my investment!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(looking around guardedly. To

WILL)

Is this a tavern?

WILL

It is also a tavern.

PRETTY WHORE

I remember you! The poet!

PRETTY WHORE (CONT'D)

One at a time, one at a time!

SECOND WHORE

(to VIOLA)

Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your

story while I tickle your fancy!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill-

repute!

WILL

It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

Come, there is no harm in a drink.

RALPH

(declining the glass)

Never when I'm working!

PRETTY WHORE

Never tried it? Never?

(groping him)

I think you are ready, Sam!

FENNYMAN

(raising his glass)

You are welcome to my best house!

Here's to the Admiral's Men!

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(shouts)

The Admiral's Men!

SAM

(to the PRETTIEST WHORE)

I...quite liked it.

FENNYMAN

Master Kent! You have not dipped your

wick?

VIOLA AS THOMAS

(baffled)

My wick?

WILL

(saving her)

Mr. Fennyman, because you love the

theatre you must have a part in my

play. I am writing an Apothecary, a

small but vital role.

FENNYMAN

(embracing WILL)

By heaven, I thank you! I will be your

Apothecary!

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

I am to be in your play.

WHORE

(to RALPH)

And what is this play about?

RALPH

Well, there's this Nurse

FENNYMAN

Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part

of the Apothecary!

HENSLOWE

The Apothecary? Will, what is the

story? Where is the shipwreck? How

does the comedy end?

WILL

By God, I wish I knew.

HENSLOWE

By God, Will, if you do not, who does?

Let us have pirates, clowns, and a

happy ending, or we will send you back

to Stratford to your wife!

PETER

(shouts)

Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

PETER (CONT'D)

A black day for us all! There is news

come up river from Deptford. Marlowe

is dead.

PETER (CONT'D)

Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern

at Deptford!

WILL

Oh...what have I done?

ALLEYN

(standing up)

He was the first man among us. A great

light has gone out.

WILL

It was I who killed him! God forgive

me, God forgive me!

WESSEX

You look sad, my lady! Let me take you

riding.

VIOLA

It is not my riding day, my lord.

WESSEX

Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

VIOLA

I am going to church.

WESSEX

(recomposing his features to

solemnity)

I understand of course. It is to be

expected.

VIOLA

It is to be expected on a Sunday.

WESSEX

And on a day of mourning. I never met

the fellow but once at your house.

VIOLA

(cannot take this in)

Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

WESSEX

Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would

be me to tell you. A great loss to

playwriting, and to dancing.

VIOLA

(faintly)

He is dead?

WESSEX

(cheerfully solemn)

Killed last night, in a tavern! Come,

then, we'll say a prayer for his soul

NURSE

My lady...my lady...now is the time to

show your breeding.

WESSEX

Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for

the love of Christ!

WESSEX (CONT'D)

(screaming)

Spare me!

VIOLA

Will!

VIOLA (CONT'D)

Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!

WILL

It is worse. I have killed a man.

WILL

Marlowe's touch was in my Titus

Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house

built on his foundations.

VIOLA

You never spoke so well of him.

WILL

He was not dead before. I would

exchange all my plays to come for all

of his that will never come.

VIOLA

You lie.

VIOLA (CONT'D)

You lie in your meadow as you lied in

my bed.

WILL

My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes,

and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir

Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife

come from Stratford to tell you that.

And yet you let me come to your bed.

VIOLA

Calf love. I loved the writer, and

gave up the prize for a sonnet.

WILL

I was the more deceived.

VOILA

Yes--you were deceived. For I never

loved you till now.

WILL

Now?

VIOLA

(declaring herself)

I love you, Will, beyond poetry.

WILL

Oh, my love

(he kisses her)

You ran from me before.

VIOLA

You were not dead before. When I

thought you dead, I did not care about

all the plays that will never come,

only that I would never see your face.

I saw our end, and it will come.

WILL

You cannot marry Wessex!

VIOLA

If not Wessex the Queen will know the

cause and there will be no more Will

Shakespeare.

WILL

No...no.

VIOLA

(through his kisses)

But I will go to Wessex as a widow

from these vows, as solemn as they are

unsanctified.

WILL

(he is mid speech)

For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt,

the one who killed Romeo's friend

Mercutio, Romeo is banished

WILL (CONT'D)

but the Friar who married Romeo and

Juliet

ACTOR (EDWARD)

Is that me. Will?

WILL

You, Edward. The Friar who married

them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

It is a secret potion. It makes her

seeming dead. She is placed in the

tomb of the Capulets. She will awake

to life and love when Romeo comes to

her side again.

WILL (CONT'D)

I have not said all. By malign fate,

the message goes astray which would

tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He

hears only that Juliet is dead. And

thus he goes to the Apothecary.

FENNYMAN

That's me.

WILL

And buys a deadly poison. He enters

the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who

lies there cold as death. He drinks

the poison. He dies by her side. And

then she wakes and sees him dead.

WILL (CONT'D)

And so Juliet takes his dagger and

kills herself.

HENSLOWE

Well, that will have them rolling in

the aisles.

FENNYMAN

Sad and wonderful! I have a blue

velvet cap which will do well, I have

seen apothecary with a cap just so.

ALLEYN

(to WILL)

Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene

missing between marriage and death.

WILL

The play. All written out for you. I

had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he

has a good fist for lettering.

WILL (CONT'D)

There's a new scene

VIOLA

Will you read it for me?

WILL

(he knows it)

"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near

day> It was the nightingale and not

the lark That pierced the fearful

hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings

on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me,

love, it was the nightingale."

VIOLA

(reading)

"It was the lark, the herald of the

morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what

envious streaks Do lace the severing

clouds in yonder east. Night's candles

are burnt out, and jocund day Stands

tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I

must be gone and live, or stay and

die."

WILL

"Yon light is not daylight, I know it,

I. It is some meteor that the sun

exhales To be to thee this night a

torchbearer..."

WILL

"...thou need'st not to be gone."

VIOLA

"I have more care to stay than will to

go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet

wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's

talk. It is not day."

TILNEY

You will go far, I fear.

TILNEY (CONT'D)

I hope we work together again. Tilney

walks away.

FENNYMAN

"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's

law Is death to any he that utters

them." Then him. Then me.

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

"Such mortal drugs I have..." What is

it? What is it?

WEBSTER

My lord!

WESSEX

(shouts)

Shakespeare!

WESSEX (CONT'D)

You upstart inky pup! Now I will show

you your place, which is in hell!

WILL

You are on my ground.

WESSEX

(drawing his sword)

By God, I'll fight the lot of you

WILL

I am more than enough.

WILL (CONT'D)

Absent friends!

(to the assembly)

This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

ALLEYN

Will

WESSEX

I rejoiced at his death because I

thought it was yours. That is all I

know of Marlowe.

ALLEYN

It's true, Will--it was a tavern

brawl...Marlowe attacked, and got his

own knife in the eye. A quarrel about

the bill

HENSLOWE

The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!

ALLEYN

Not the billing, the bill!

WILL

(to the heavens)

Oh God, I am free of it!

WESSEX

Close it!

TILNEY

My Lord Wessex!

WESSEX

(foaming)

Close it! Take it down stone by stone!

I want it ploughed into the ground,

and sown with quick lime!

HENSLOWE

Mr. Tilney, what is this?

TILNEY

Sedition and indecency!

HENSLOWE

What?!

WEBSTER

Master of the Revels, sir, over here,

sir.

TILNEY

(to WEBSTER)

Where, boy?

WEBSTER

(points)

I saw her bubbies!

TILNEY

(shocked and gratified)

A woman on the stage? A woman?

WEBSTER

I swear it!

TILNEY

So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is

closed! On the authority of the powers

invested in my by the court--I close

this theatre!

HENSLOWE

Why so?

TILNEY

(triumphantly)

For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For

displaying a female on the public

stage!

WEBSTER

(pointing at SAM)

Not him.

(pointing at VIOLA)

her.

HENSLOWE

He's a woman!

TILNEY

That's who I meant! This theatre is

closed! Notice will be posted!

HENSLOWE

(to NED)

Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!

VIOLA

(hoping to protect WILL)

Nobody knew!

WEBSTER

(pointing at WILL)

He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!

TILNEY

Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!

HENSLOWE

(in despair)

It is over.

VIOLA

I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted

to be an actor.

(she turns to WILL)

I am sorry, Will.

WABASH

Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w-

wonderful.

VIOLA

Thank you.

FENNYMAN

Everything all right?

FENNYMAN

(muttering)

I would have been good...I would have

been great.

RALPH

So would I. We both would.

FENNYMAN

(shouts)

Lambert!

FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

Kill him!

ALLEYN

Well, Burbage--you never did know when

your scene was over.

BURBAGE

That can wait. The Master of the

Revels despises us for vagrants,

tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But

my father, James Burbage, had the

first licence to make a company of

players from Her Majesty, and he drew

from poets the literature of the age.

Their fame will be our fame. So let

them all know, we are men of parts. We

are a brotherhood, and we will be a

profession. Will Shakespeare has a

play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is

yours.

BY PERMISSION OF

MR. BURBAGE

A

HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION

OF

MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION

OF

THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE

OF

THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY

OF

ROMEO AND JULIET

with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary

HENSLOWE

Will!

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

We'll be needing a Romeo

WESSEX

My ship is moored at Bankside, bound

for Virginia on the afternoon

tide--please do not weep, Lady De

Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.

DE LESSEPS

And you are gaining five thousand

pounds, my lord...by these drafts in my

hand.

WESSEX

Would you oblige me with fifty or so

in gold?--just to settle my accounts at

the dockside?

WESSEX (CONT'D)

Ah!--Look, she comes!

VIOLA

Good morning, my lord. I see you are

open for business so let's to church.

NURSE

My lord!

NURSE (CONT'D)

Be good to her, my lord!

WESSEX

I will.

NURSE

God bless you!

WESSEX

Thank you. Let go, there's a good

nurse.

WESSEX (CONT'D)

The tide will not wait. Farewell!

MAKEPEACE

Licentiousness is made a show, vice is

made a show, vanity and pride likewise

made a show! This is the very business

of show

"ROMEO."

FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's

cap in hand.

FENNYMAN

Is this all right?

WABASH

(mutter)

T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike

in d-d-d-dignity.

WILL

(to HENSLOWE)

We are lost.

HENSLOWE

No, it will turn out well.

WILL

How will it?

HENSLOWE

I don't know, it's a mystery.

WABASH AS THE CHORUS

T-t-t-t-two

WABASH AS THE CHORUS

"...Household both alike in dignity (in

fair Verona where we lay our scene)

From ancient grudge break to new

mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil

hands unclean. From forth the fatal

loins of these two foes A pair of star-

cross'd lovers take their life, Whose

misadventured piteous overthrows Doth

with their death bury their parents'

strife..."

WILL

(to WABASH)

Wonderful!

WABASH

W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?

JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON

"Gregory, on my word we'll not carry

coals."

JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY

"No, for then we should be colliers."

WILL looks as if he would rather be

dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL,

nervously.

SAM

(nervously--in a deep bass

guttural hoarse voice)

Master Shakespeare

WILL

(absently)

Luck be with you, Sam.

(as the awful truth gets

through to him)

Sam...?

SAM

(in the same voice)

It is not my fault, Master

Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.

WILL

Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.

SAM

(the effect is horrible)

"Parting is such sweet sorrow..."

HENSLOWE

Another little problem.

WILL

What do we do now?

HENSLOWE

The show must ... you know

WILL

Go on.

HENSLOWE

Juliet does not come on for twenty

pages. It will be all right.

WILL

How will it?

HENSLOWE

I don't know. It's a mystery.

ARMITAGE AS ABRAM

"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"

JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON

"I do bite my thumb, sir."

HENSLOWE

Can we talk?

HENSLOWE (CONT'D)

(whispering to BURBAGE)

We have no Juliet!

BURBAGE

(forgetting to whisper)

No Juliet?!

VIOLA

(turning)

No Juliet?!

HENSLOWE

it will be all right, madam.

VIOLA

What happened to Sam?

HENSLOWE

Who are you?

VIOLA

Thomas Kent!

HENSLOWE

Do you know it?

VIOLA

(showing the manuscript)

Every word.

PHILIP AS LADY CAPULET

"Nurse, where is my daughter? Call her

forth to me."

RALPH AS NURSE

"Now by my maidenhead at twelve year

old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What

ladybird."

RALPH AS NURSE

(on stage)

"God forbid. Where's this girl?

RALPH AS NURSE (CONT'D)

"What, Juliet!"

VIOLA AS JULIET

"How now, who calls?"

RALPH AS NURSE

"Your mother."

VIOLA AS JULIET

"Madam. I am here, what is your will?

BURBAGE

We will all be put in the clink.

HENSLOWE

(shrugs)

See you in jail.

FENNYMAN

"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's

Law Is death to any he that utters

them." Then him. Then me.

ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO

(to ROMEO)

"I am hurt.

WILL AS ROMEO

Courage man. The hurt cannot be much.

ALLEYN A MERCUTIO

Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find

me a grave man."

ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D)

"...--Why the devil came you between us?

I was hurt under your arms."

ACTOR AS BENVOLIO

"Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens

are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not

amazed. The prince will doom thee

death If thou art taken. Hence, be

gone away!"

WILL AS ROMEO

"I am fortune's fool!"

ACTOR AS BENVOLIO

"Why dost thou stay!"

WILL

I am fortune's fool.

WILL (CONT'D)

You are married?

WILL (CONT'D)

If you be married, my gave is like to

be my wedding bed. The implication of

her silence fills the air. WILL does

not move.

VIOLA AS JULIET

"Art thou gone so?

VIOLA AS JULIET (CONT'D)

Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must

hear from thee every day in the hour,

For in a minute there are many days.

O, by this count I shall be much in

years Ere I again behold my Romeo..."

WILL AS ROMEO

"...Farewell..."

VIOLA AS JULIET

"O think'st thou we shall ever meet

again...? Methinks I see thee, now thou

art so low, As one dead in the bottom

of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails,

or thou lookest pale."

WILL AS ROMEO

"Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you.

Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu.

Adieu"

EDWARD AS FRIAR

"No warmth, no breath shall testify

thou livest And in this borrow'd

likeness of shrunk death Thou shall

continue two and forty hours And then

awake as from a pleasant sleep..."

WILL AS ROMEO

"Come hither, man. I see that thou art

poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let

me have A dram of poison--"

FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY

"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's

law is death to any he that utters

them!"

FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY

"My poverty but not my will consents."

WILL AS ROMEO

"I pay thy poverty and not thy will."

WILL AS ROMEO

"Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your

last embrace! and lips, Oh you The

doors of breath, seal with a righteous

kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing

death! Come, bitter conduct; come,

unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot,

now at once run on The dashing rocks

thy seasick weary bark!"

WILL AS ROMEO

"Here's to my love (he drinks) O true

Apothecary."

FENNYMAN

(whispers to himself)

I was good. I was great.

WILL AS ROMEO

"Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss

I die." (and he dies)

VIOLA AS JULIET

"...Where is my lord?

NURSE

(involuntarily)

Dead!

VIOLA AS JULIET

"What here? A cup clos'd in my true

love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been

his timeless end."

VIOLA AS JULIET

"...O happy dagger

THE PRINCE

"For never was a story of more woe

Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

TILNEY

(shouts triumphantly)

I arrest you in the name of Queen

Elizabeth!

BURBAGE

Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

TILNEY

Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The

Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you

ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt

of the authority invested in me by her

Majesty.

BURBAGE

Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have

not opened it.

TILNEY

(he points a "j'accuse"

finger at VIOLA)

That woman is a woman!

ALLEYN

What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!

TILNEY

I'll see you all in the clink! In the

same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

VOICE

Mr. Tilney...!

QUEEN

Have a care with my name, you will

wear it out.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

The Queen of England does not attend

exhibitions of public lewdness so

something is out of joint. Come here,

Master Kent. Let me look at you.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

Yes, the illusion is remarkable and

your error, Mr. Tilney, easily

forgiven, but I know something of a

woman in a man's profession, yes, by

God, I do know about that. That is

enough from you, Maser Kent. If only

Lord Wessex were here.

VOICE

He is, Ma'am.

WESSEX

(weakly)

Your Majesty

QUEEN

There was a wager, I remember...as to

whether a play can show the very truth

and nature of love. I think you lost

it today.

(turning to WEBSTER)

You are an eager boy. Did you like the

play?

WEBSTER

I liked it when she stabbed herself,

your Majesty.

QUEEN

Master Shakespeare. Next time to you

come to Greenwich, Come as yourself

and we will speak some more. WILL bows

deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The

waves part for her.

WESSEX

Your Majesty!

QUEEN

Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so

soon?

WESSEX

Indeed I am a bride short. How is this

to end?

QUEEN

As stories must when love's

denied--with tears and a journey. Those

whom God has joined in marriage, not

even I can put asunder.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

(she turns to VIOLA)

Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost

his wife in the play- house--go make

your farewell and send her out. It's

time to settle accounts.

(to WESSEX)

How much was the wager?

WESSEX

Fifty shillings.

(the QUEEN gives him a look)

Pounds.

QUEEN

Give it to Master Kent. He will see it

rightfully home. WESSEX gives his

purse to VIOLA.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

(to VIOLA)

And tell Shakespeare something more

cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.

QUEEN (CONT'D)

Too late, too late.

WILL

(heartbroken, testing her

name)

My Lady Wessex?

VIOLA

A hired player no longer. Fifty

pounds, Will, for the poet of true

love.

WILL

I am done with theatre. The playhouse

is for dreamers. Look where the dream

has brought us.

VIOLA

It was we ourselves did that. And for

my life to come I would not have it

otherwise.

WILL

I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.

VIOLA

If my hurt is to be that you will

write no more, then I shall be the

sorrier.

VIOLA (CONT'D)

The Queen commands a comedy, Will for

Twelfth Night.

WILL

(harshly)

A comedy! What will my hero be but the

saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick

with love?

VIOLA

An excellent beginning

(a beat)

Let him be...a duke. And your heroine?

WILL

(bitterly)

Sold in marriage and half way to

America.

VIOLA

(adjusting)

At sea, then--a voyage to a new

world?...she lands upon a vast and empty

shore. She is brought to the

duke...Orsino.

WILL

(despite himself)

Orsino...good name

VIOLA

But fearful of her virtue, she comes

to him dressed as a boy

WILL

(Catching it)

and thus unable to declare her love

VIOLA

But all ends well.

WILL

How does it?

VIOLA

I don't know. It's a mystery

WILL (CONT'D)

You will never age for me, nor fade,

nor die.

VIOLA

Nor you for me.

WILL

Good bye, my love, a thousand times

good bye.

VIOLA

Write me well.

WILL (VO)

My story starts at sea...a perilous

voyage to an unknown land...a shipwreck

WILL (VO)

the wild waters roar and heave...the

brave vessel is dashed all to pieces,

and all the helpless souls within her

drowned

WILL (VO)

all save one ... a lady

WILL (VO)

whose soul is greater than the ocean ...

and her spirit stronger than the sea's

embrace ... not for her watery end, but

a new life beginning on a stranger

shore

WILL (VO CONTINUED)

It will be a love story ... for she will

be my heroine for all time

WILL (VO CONTINUED)

and her name will be ... Viola.

THE END
