VITO

Pop asked you.

SAL

I'm gonna kill somebody today.

MOTHER SISTER

Good morning, Mookie.

MOOKIE

Good morning to you.

MOTHER SISTER

HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya

falling out from the heat.  You

MOOKIE

I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear

you.

MOTHER SISTER

Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.

Mother Sister always watches.

PINO

MOOKIE

Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

VITO

MOOKIE

PINO

Shaddup, Vito.

MOOKIE

PINO

You get paid to do what we say.

MOOKIE

What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say

nuthin'.

PINO

Who's working for who?

SAL

Come on in, Mayor.

DA MAYOR

Good morning, gentlemens.  It's

gonna be a scorcher today, that's

for sure.  Need any work done

around here?

DA MAYOR

It will be the cleanest sidewalk in

Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of

Health.

PINO

Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We

runnin' welfare or somethin'?

Every day you give dat bum--

MOOKIE

Da Mayor ain't no bum.

PINO

Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping

our sidewalk.  What do we pay

Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I

work harder than him and I'm your

own son.

MOOKIE

Who don't work?  Let's see you

carry six large pies up six flights

of stairs.  No elevator either and

shit.

SAL

Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a

place of business.

VITO

Tell 'em, Pop.

PINO

Me and you are gonna have a talk.

VITO

Sez who?

PINO

Sez me.

SAL

Hey!  What did I say?

MOOKIE

Who doesn't work?  Don't start no

shit, won't be no shit.

SAL

Mookie, no cursing in the store.

MOOKIE

Talk to your son.

ELLA

What's keeping him?

PUNCHY

You call him, then.

ELLA

Yo, Ahmad!

PUNCHY

I coulda done dat.

ELLA

Yo, Ahmad!

ELLA

Punchy, if ya want to do some more

screaming, be my guest.  I'm too

through.

AHMAD

Who's yelling my name?

ELLA

Punchy told me to.

AHMAD

Don't listen to him, it will get ya

in trouble.

ELLA

Heard that, Punchy.

AHMAD

Ella, you have a brain, use it.

RADIO RAHEEM

Peace, y'all.

ELLA

Peace, Radio Raheem.

CEE

Peace.

10.

PUNCHY

You the man, Radio Raheem.

AHMAD

It's your world.

CEE

In a big way.

AHMAD

My people.  My people.

DA MAYOR

Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?

KOREAN CLERK

No mo' Bud.  You look what we have

and buy.

DA MAYOR

No more Bud.  What kind of joint is

this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,

this ain't Korea, China, or wherever

you come from.  Get some Budweiser

in this motherfucker.

KOREAN CLERK

You buy 'nother beer.

11.

DA MAYOR

Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're

asking a lot to make a man change

his beer, that's asking a lot,

Doctor.

MOTHER SISTER

You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya

about drinking in front of my stoop?

Move on, you're blocking my view.

MOTHER SISTER

You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

MOTHER SISTER

The evil eye doesn't work on me.

DA MAYOR

Mother Sister, you've been talkin'

'bout me the last eighteen years.

What have I ever done to you?

MOTHER SISTER

You're a drunk fool.

DA MAYOR

Besides that.  Da Mayor don't

bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother

Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just

mind his business.  I love everybody.

I even love you.

MOTHER SISTER

Hold your tongue.  You don't have

that much love.

DA MAYOR

One day you'll be nice to me.  We

might both be dead and buried, but

you'll be nice.  At least civil.

12.

TINA

Hector, I shouldn't be telling you

this but you would find out sooner

or later.  Ya father ain't no real

father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum

in a hundred-dollar world.  Your

father is to the curb.  You're

smart.  I see that look on ya face.

You're saying if he's such a bum

why am I with him?  Good question.

Like I said before, you're no dummy.

He talked his way into my panties,

I thought being a mother would make

me happy, make me whole.  He's a

mistake, but you are not.

ML

The way I see it, if this hot

weather continues, it will surely

melt the polar caps and the whole

wide world--the parts that ain't

water already--will be flooded.

13.

COCONUT SID

You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker.

Where did you read that?

ML

Don't worry about it.  But when it

happens and I'm in my boat and ya

black ass is drowning, don't ask me

to throw you a lifesaver either.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Fool, you're thirty cents away from

a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?

ML

Don't worry about it.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat

the holes out of donuts.

ML

I'll be back on my feet.  Soon

enough.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

So when is all this ice suppose to

melt?

SAL

You paying now or on layaway?

BUGGIN' OUT

How much?

SAL

You come in here at least three

times a day.  You a retard?  A buck

fifty.

BUGGIN' OUT

Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on

that motherfucker.

14.

SAL

Extra cheese is two dollars.

Y'know dat.

BUGGIN' OUT

Two dollars!  Forget it!

BUGGIN' OUT

Mookie.

MOOKIE

What?

BUGGIN' OUT

How come you ain't got no brothers

up?

MOOKIE

Ask Sal.

BUGGIN' OUT

Sal, how come you ain't got no

brothers up on the wall here?

SAL

You want brothers up on the Wall of

Fame, you open up your own business,

then you can do what you wanna do.

My pizzeria, Italian Americans up

on the wall.

15.

VITO

Take it easy, Pop.

SAL

Don't start on me today.

BUGGIN' OUT

Sal, that might be fine, you own

this, but rarely do I see any

Italian Americans eating in here.

All I've ever seen is Black folks.

So since we spend much money here,

we do have some say.

SAL

You a troublemaker?

PINO

You making trouble.

BUGGIN' OUT

Put some brothers up on this Wall

of Fame.  We want Malcolm X, Angela

Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow.

SAL

Don't come back, either.

BUGGIN' OUT

Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.

MOOKIE

Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

BUGGIN' OUT

I'm cool.  I'm cool.

MOOKIE

Come back in a week, it will be

squashed.

16.

SAL

Mookie, if your friends can't

behave, they're not welcome.

MOOKIE

I got no say over people.

PINO

You talk to 'em.

MOOKIE

People are free to do what they

wanna do.

SAL

I know, this is America, but I

don't want no trouble.

DA MAYOR

Mookie.

MOOKIE

Gotta go.

DA MAYOR

C'mere, Doctor.

DA MAYOR

Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.

MOOKIE

OK.  OK.

DA MAYOR

Doctor, always try to do the right

thing.

MOOKIE

That's it?

DA MAYOR

That's it.

17.

MOOKIE

I got it.

NILDA

I hope it's not cold.

MOOKIE

No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars

for the pie.

MOOKIE

Hold it.  Let me count this first.

MOOKIE

You're short.

NILDA

I counted the twelve dollars myself.

MOOKIE

Twelve is right, but no tip.

18.

NILDA

No tip.

MOOKIE

Look, lady.  I carried your pizza

up five flights of stairs and shit.

The cheese didn't slide over to one

side like it sometimes does with

delivery people who don't care.  I

do care.  May I get paid?

NILDA

Wait here.

MOOKIE

I'll wait.

MOOKIE

Gracias mucho.

MOOKIE

A dollar!  Cheap bastard!  Your

pizza is gonna be fucked next time.

MOTHER SISTER

Jade, you're late.

JADE

I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here

now.  Where's the stuff?

19.

MOTHER SISTER

Seen your brother, just walked by.

JADE

This might take some time.

MOTHER SISTER

I got nowhere to go.  We haven't

had a good sit-down for a long while.

MOTHER SISTER

Tender-headed runs in my family.

You tender-headed?

JADE

Yeah, me too.

MOTHER SISTER

That's why I don't fool with it.

Only let you touch it...Ouch!

JADE

Sorry, comb got caught.

MOTHER SISTER

Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is

an old woman.

JADE

How are you holding up in this

weather?

MOTHER SISTER

I'll do.

JADE

I don't know why you still haven't

bought an air conditioner.

MOTHER SISTER

Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.

20.

DA MAYOR

I didn't know you had such beautiful

hair.

MOTHER SISTER

Fool, there's a lot in this world

you don't know.

DA MAYOR

I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.

JADE

You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it

isn't right.

MOTHER SISTER

I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides,

he reminds me of my least favorite

peoples.  My tenants and my ex-

husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.

MOTHER SISTER

Number One: I got some jive, late-

rent-paying trifling Negroes in

this house.  Every year I keep

threatening to sell it.

JADE

And move to Long Island...

MOTHER SISTER

And move to Long Island.  Number

Two: my ex-husband lost all my

property, all my money in his

scheme to build a Black business

empire.  Needless to say what

happened, this house is it, all I

got.  I'm too through with yar

people.

JADE

Whew!

21.

New York Post: "A SCORCHER"

New York Daily News: "2 HOT 4 U?"

New York Newsday: "OH BOY!  BAKED APPLE"

New York Times: "RECORD HEATWAVE HITS CITY"

22.

ELLA

Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!

I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!

AHMAD

Yo!

ELLA

No!

23.

CHARLIE

I'm not playing.  There's gonna be

trouble if you fuck around.

PUNCHY

Go 'head.  You got it.  You got it.

CHARLIE

This is an expensive car.

CEE

You won't get wet.

24.

CHARLIE

I'm warning you.

PUNCHY

C'mon.

CEE

Hurry up.  We ain't got all day.

CHARLIE

I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever

catch those fucks they'll be sorry.

Cocksucking sonabitches!

CHARLIE

You people make me sick.

CHARLIE

Officers, I want an arrest made.

Now.

25.

OFFICER PONTE

What happened?

CHARLIE

Two Black kids soaked me and my car.

It's fucking ruined.

OFFICER LONG

Where are they?

CHARLIE

Where are they?  What kind of

fucking asshole question is that?

They ran the fuck away.

OFFICER PONTE

Do you wish to file a complaint?

CHARLIE

A complaint.  I want those fucks

locked under the jail.

OFFICER PONTE

This hydrant better not come back

on or there's gonna be hell to pay.

CHARLIE

What about my car?  I want justice.

OFFICER LONG

You know anything about this?

CHARLIE

He knows.  He's a witness.  They

all know.  He saw the whole thing.

OFFICER LONG

Who were the punks?

DA MAYOR

Those who'll tell don't know.

Those who know won't tell.

26.

OFFICER PONTE

A wise guy.

MOOKIE

Let's go, Mayor.

OFFICER LONG

Keep this hydrant off.  You want to

swim, go to Coney Island.

CHARLIE

He's leaving?  What about me?

OFFICER PONTE

I suggest you get in your car

quick, before these people start to

strip it clean.

OFFICER LONG

Let's go, break it up.  Go back to

your jobs.

OFFICER PONTE

What jobs?

SAL

Mookie, what took you so long?  I

got a business to run.

MOOKIE

Run it then.

27.

SAL

Here, this goes to the radio station.

VITO

Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.

SAL

Good, make sure he don't jerk around.

PINO

Yeah, hurry back, it's getting

crowded.

VITO

Mister Senor Love Daddy is cool.

MOOKIE

Ya like him, huh?

VITO

Yeah.

MOOKIE

Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya

brother and shit, but the next time

he hits ya, the next time he

touches ya, you should "house him."

Kick his ass.

VITO

I don't know.

MOOKIE

If you don't make a stand, he's

gonna be beating ya like a egg for

the rest of your life.

VITO

That's what you think?

MOOKIE

That's what I think.

VITO

I don't like to fight.

28.

MOOKIE

Do it this one time and he'll never

touch you again.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling

but help has arrived.  My main man

Mookie has saved the day, straight

from Sal's Famous Pizzeria, down

the block.  Come up to the mike,

Mookie.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells

good.  This is ya Love Daddy

talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin.

Say something, Mookie.

MOOKIE

Mister Senor Love Daddy, I'd like

to dedicate the next record to my

heart, Tina.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Alright.  Let me play this record

while I go to work on my chicken

Parmigiana hero with extra cheese

and extra sauce.

VO

I just looove you so much Mister

Senor Love Daddy.  WE LOVE RADIO,

108 FM.

29.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Here ya are.

(he hands Mookie a

twenty-dollar bill)

Keep the change.

MOOKIE

That's right on time.  This is my

friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Tell ya father he makes the best

heros in Brooklyn.

VITO

I'll do that.

MOOKIE

We're outta here.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Thanks for stopping by.  WE LOVE

Radio, 108 FM.

30.

STEVIE

You got it, bro.

MOOKIE

You the man.

BUGGIN' OUT

You the man.

MOOKIE

No, you the man.

BUGGIN' OUT

No.  I'm just a struggling Black

man trying to keep my dick hard in

a cruel and harsh world.

MOOKIE

Vito is down.

BUGGIN' OUT

Yo!

31.

BUGGIN' OUT

Yo!

CLIFTON

Yes?

BUGGIN' OUT

You almost knocked me down.  The

word is "excuse me."

CLIFTON

Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.

BUGGIN' OUT

Not only did you knock me down, you

stepped on my new white Air Jordans

that I just bought and that's all

you can say, "Excuse me?"

BUGGIN' OUT

I'll fuck you up quick two times.

BUGGIN' OUT

Who told you to step on my sneakers?

Who told you to walk on my side of

the block?  Who told you to be in

my neighborhood?

CLIFTON

I own a brownstone on this block.

BUGGIN' OUT

Who told you to buy a brownstone on

my block, in my neighborhood on my

side of the street?

BUGGIN' OUT

What do you want to live in a Black

neighborhood for?  Motherfuck

gentrification.

CLIFTON

I'm under the assumption that this

is a free country and one can live

where he pleases.

32.

BUGGIN' OUT

A free country?

BUGGIN' OUT

I should fuck you up just for that

stupid shit alone.

AHMAD

Your Jordans are dogged.

CEE

You might as well throw 'em out.

PUNCHY

They looked good before he messed

them up.

ELLA

You used to be so fine.

AHMAD

How much did you pay for them?

CEE

A hundred bucks.

AHMAD

A hundred bucks!

BUGGIN' OUT

You're lucky the Black man has a

loving heart.  Next time you see me

coming, cross the street quick.

AHMAD

He's dissing you.

BUGGIN' OUT

Damn, my brand-new Jordans.  You

should buy me another pair.

CLIFTON

I'm gonna leave now.

BUGGIN' OUT

If I wasn't a righteous Black man

you'd be in serious trouble.

SERIOUS.

33.

BUGGIN' OUT

Move back to Connecticut.

SAL

I should have Vito go with you all

the time.

PINO

Yeah, no more ninety-minute

deliveries around the corner.

MOOKIE

Pino, I work hard like everybody in

here.

VITO

He's right.

PINO

C'mere.

(Pino smacks his brother)

Don't get too friendly with da Mook.

SAL

That's gonna be the last time you

hit Vito.

MOOKIE

Smack him back.

PINO

What?

MOOKIE

Remember what I said.

PINO

Are you gonna listen to this Mook?

Listen to him tell you to smack me?

Your only brother?

PINO

I didn't think so.

34.

OFFICER PONTE

What a waste.

COCONUT SID

As I was saying before we were so

rudely interrupted by the finest.

ML

What was you saying?

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.

ML

Look at that.

COCONUT SID

Look at what?

ML

It's a fucking shame.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

What is?

35.

ML

Sweet Dick Willie.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

That's my name.

ML

Do I have to spell it out?

COCONUT SID

Make it plain.

ML

OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break

it down.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Let it be broke.

ML

Can ya dig it?

SWEET DICK WILLIE

It's dug.

ML

Look at those Korean motherfuckers

across the street.  I betcha they

haven't been a year off da

motherfucking boat before they

opened up their own place.

COCONUT SID

It's been about a year.

ML

A motherfucking year off the

motherfucking boat and got a good

business in our neighborhood

occupying a building that had been

boarded up for longer than I care

to remember and I've been here a

long time.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

It has been a long time.

36.

COCONUT SID

How long?

ML

Too long!  Too long.  Now for the

life of me, I haven't been able to

figger this out.  Either dem

Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks

are dumb.

COCONUT SID

It's gotta be cuz we're Black.  No

other explanation, nobody don't

want the Black man to be about shit.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Old excuse.

ML

I'll be one happy fool to see us

have our own business right here.

Yes, sir.  I'd be the first in line

to spend the little money I got.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

It's Miller time.  Let me go give

these Koreans s'more business.

ML

It's a motherfucking shame.

COCONUT SID

Ain't that a bitch.

DA MAYOR

Sonny!  Sonny!

DA MAYOR

Doctor, what's your name?

37.

EDDIE

Eddie Lovell.

DA MAYOR

How old are you?

EDDIE

Ten.

DA MAYOR

What makes Sammy run?

EDDIE

My name is Eddie.

DA MAYOR

What makes Sammy run?

EDDIE

I said my name is Eddie Lovell.

DA MAYOR

Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to

the corner store.  How much will it

cost me?

EDDIE

How would I know how much it's

gonna cost if I don't know what I'm

buying?

DA MAYOR

Eddie, you're too smart for your

own britches.  Listen to me.  How

much do you want to run to the

store for Da Mayor?

EDDIE

Fifty cents.

DA MAYOR

You got a deal.

DA MAYOR

Git me a quart of beer, Budweiser,

say it's for your father, if they

bother you.

38.

AHMAD

Who told him he was Da Mayor of

this block?

CEE

He's self-appointed.

ELLA

Leave him alone.

PUNCHY

Shut up.

DA MAYOR

Go on now.  Leave me be.

AHMAD

You walk up and down this block

like you own it.

CEE

Da Mayor.

PUNCHY

You're old.

AHMAD

A old drunk bum.

AHMAD

What do you have to say?

DA MAYOR

What do you know 'bout me?  Y'all

can't even pee straight.  What do

you know?  Until you have stood in

the doorway and heard the hunger of

your five children, unable to do a

damn thing about it, you don't know

shit.  You don't know my pain, you

don't know me.  Don't call me a

bum, don't call me a drunk, you

don't know me, and it's

disrespectful.  I know your parents

raised you better.

ELLA

He told you off.

39.

MOOKIE

I know I haven't seen you in four

days.  I'm a working man.

TINA (VO)

I work too, but I still make time.

MOOKIE

Tina, what do you want me to do?

TINA (VO)

I want you to spend some time with

me.  I want you to try and make

this relationship work.  If not,

I'd rather not be bothered.

MOOKIE

Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over

there sometime today.

TINA (VO)

When?

MOOKIE

Before I get off work.

TINA (VO)

Bring some ice cream, I'm burning

up.  Do you love me?

MOOKIE

Do I love you?

SAL

Mookie, get offa da phone.

MOOKIE

Love Daddy's show to you.

TINA (VO)

Big deal.

40.

SAL

MOOKIE

Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I

MOOKIE

Everybody happy now?

PINO

Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two

large pizzas, pepperoni and

anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop,

How come you niggers are so stupid?

MOOKIE

If ya see a nigger here, kick his

41.

PINO

Fuck you and stay off the phone.

VITO

Forget it, Mookie.

MOOKIE

Who's your favorite basketball

player?

PINO

MOOKIE

And not Larry Bird?  Who's your

favorite movie star?

PINO

Eddie Murphy.

MOOKIE

Last question: Who's your favorite

rock star?

MOOKIE

Barry Manilow?

MOOKIE

Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.

VITO

It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.

PINO

Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!

MOOKIE

Sounds funny to me.  As much as you

say nigger this and nigger that,

all your favorite people are

"niggers."

42.

PINO

It's different.  Magic, Eddie,

Prince are not niggers, I mean, are

not Black.  I mean, they're Black

but not really Black.  They're more

than Black.  It's different.

MOOKIE

Pino, I think secretly that you

wish you were Black.  That's what I

think.  Vito, what do you say?

PINO

Y'know, I've been listening and

reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't

know that, did you?

MOOKIE

I didn't know you could read.

PINO

Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister

Farrakhan always talks about the

so-called "day" when the Black man

will rise.  "We will one day rule

the earth as we did in our glorious

past."  You really believe that shit?

MOOKIE

It's e-vit-able.

PINO

Keep dreaming.

MOOKIE

Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck

Frank Sinatra, too.

PINO

Well, fuck you, too, and fuck

Michael Jordan.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Yo!  Hold up!  Time out!  Time out!

Y'all take a chill.  Ya need to

cool that shit out... and that's

the truth, Ruth.

CUT TO:

MOOKIE

Sal, can you do me a favor?

SAL

Depends.

MOOKIE

Can you pay me now?

SAL

Can't do.

MOOKIE

Sal, just this once, do me that

solid.

SAL

You know you don't get paid till we

close tonight.  We're still open.

MOOKIE

I would like to get paid now.

SAL

Tonight, when we close.

45.

MOOKIE

Whaddup.  Money?

RADIO RAHEEM

I was going to buy a slice.

MOOKIE

I'll be back after I make this

delivery.

RADIO RAHEEM

On the rebound.

MOOKIE

That's the dope.

RADIO RAHEEM

I just copped them.  Let me tell

you the story of Right-Hand--Left-

Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.

MOOKIE

I'm listening.

RADIO RAHEEM

HATE!

RADIO RAHEEM

It was with this hand that Brother

Cain iced his brother.  LOVE!

RADIO RAHEEM

See these fingers, they lead

straight to the soul of man.  The

right hand.  The hand of LOVE!

RADIO RAHEEM

The story of Life is this...

46.

RADIO RAHEEM

STATIC!  One hand is always fighting

the other.  Left Hand Hate is

kicking much ass and it looks like

Right Hand Love is finished.  Hold

up.  Stop the presses!  Love is

coming back, yes, it's Love.  Love

has won.  Left Hand Hate KO'ed by

Love.

RADIO RAHEEM

Brother, Mookie, if I love you I

love you, but if I hate you...

MOOKIE

I understand.

RADIO RAHEEM

I love you, my brother.

MOOKIE

I love you, Black.

RADIO RAHEEM

Two slices.

SAL

No service till you turn dat shit

off.

RADIO RAHEEM

Two slices.

PINO

Turn it off.

SAL

Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even

hear myself think.  You are

disturbing me and you are disturbing

my customers.

47.

RADIO RAHEEM

Two slices, extra cheese.

SAL

When you come in Sal's Famous

Pizzeria, no music.  No rap, no

music.  Capisce?  Understand?...

This is a place of business.  Extra

cheese is two dollars.

MOOKIE

Thanks.

MOOKIE

Jade.

JADE (OS)

I'm in here.

JADE

How come you're not at Sal's?

MOOKIE

I'm working.

48.

JADE

Is this another one of your patented

two-hour lunches?

MOOKIE

I just come home to take a quick

shower.

JADE

Sal's gonna be mad.

MOOKIE

Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I

think you're more concerned with

him than me.

JADE

I think no such a thing.  Sal pays

you, you should work.

MOOKIE

Slavery days are over.  My name

ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't

want to argue, stop pressing me.

JADE

I just don't want you to lose the

one job you've been able to keep,

that's all.  I'm carrying you as it

is.

MOOKIE

Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get

paid.

JADE

Yeah, then ya should take better

care of your responsibilities.

MOOKIE

What responsibilities?

JADE

I didn't stutter.  Take care of

your responsibilities.  Y'know

exactly what I'm talking about.

49.

SAL

I'm beat.

PINO

Pop, I think we should sell this

place, get outta here while we're

still ahead...and alive.

SAL

Since when do you know what's best

for us?

PINO

Couldn't we sell this and open up a

new one in our own neighborhood?

SAL

Too many pizzerias already there.

PINO

Then we could try something else.

SAL

We don't know nuthin' else.

PINO

I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad

neighborhood.  I don't like being

around them, they're animals.

50.

VITO

Some are OK.

PINO

My friends laugh at me all the

time, laugh right in my face, tell

me go feed the Moulies.

SAL

Do your friends put money in your

pocket?  Pay your rent?  Food on ya

plate?

SAL

I didn't think so.

PINO

Pop, what else can I say?  I don't

wanna be here, they don't want us

here.  We should stay in our own

neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.

SAL

So what if this is a Black

neighborhood, so what if we're a

minority.  I've never had no

trouble with dese people, don't

want none either, so don't start

none.  This is America.  Sal's

Famous Pizzeria is here for good.

You think you know it all?  Well,

you don't.  I'm your father, you

better remember that.

JADE

Hurry up and get dressed.

MOOKIE

I'm coming.

JADE

I'm going with you.

51.

BUGGIN' OUT

Da Mayor, we need your leadership.

DA MAYOR

Doctor, what are you talkin' bout?

BUGGIN' OUT

I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's

Famous Pizzeria.

DA MAYOR

Keep walkin', Doctor.  I don't want

to hear none of your foolishness.

CUT TO:

ML

No!

COCONUT SID

No!

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Hell no!  Goddamnit.  Sal ain't

never done me no harm.  You either.

CUT TO:

BUGGIN' OUT

Would you like to sign a petition

to boycott Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUGGIN' OUT

I'll do it without your help.

52.

BUGGIN' OUT

Sal, we're gonna boycott ya fat ass.

BUGGIN' OUT

It's so nice to see a family

hanging out together.

MOOKIE

We're not hanging out.  I'm being

escorted back to work.

JADE

That's not even true.  I just want

a slice.

BUGGIN' OUT

Jade, you don't know this, but I'm

organizing a boycott of Sal's

Famous Pizzeria.

JADE

What did he do this time?

BUGGIN' OUT

Y'know all those pictures he has

hanging on the Wall of Fame?

JADE

So?

BUGGIN' OUT

Have you noticed something about

them?

53.

JADE

No.

MOOKIE

(interjects)

Yo, I'm gone.

JADE

I'll see ya there.

BUGGIN' OUT

Peace.

BUGGIN' OUT

Every single one of those pictures

is somebody Italian.

JADE

And?

BUGGIN' OUT

And I--we--want some Black people up.

JADE

Did you ask Sal?

BUGGIN' OUT

Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want

nobody in there, nobody spending

good money in Sal's.  He should get

no mo' money from the community

till he puts some Black faces up on

that motherfucking wall.

JADE

Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be

disrespectful, but you can really

direct your energies in a more

useful way.

BUGGIN' OUT

So, in other words, you are not down.

JADE

I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.

BUGGIN' OUT

Jade, I still love you.

54.

JADE

I still love you too.

SAL

Mookie, you are pushing it.  You're

really pushing it.  I'm not paying

you good money to fucking jerk me

around.

SAL

You're gonna be in the street with

the rest of your homeboys.

PINO

'Bout time, Pop.

SAL

Jade, we've been wondering when ya

would pay us a visit.

JADE

Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito.

JADE

What's happening, Jade?

JADE

Nuthin' really.  How are you

treating my brother?

SAL

The Mook?  Great.  Mookie's a good

kid.

PINO

Pop, stop lying.

SAL

Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?

JADE

What's good?

55.

SAL

Everything, but for you I'm gonna

make up something special.  Take a

seat.  There, that's a clean table.

JADE

You still letting Pino push you

around?

VITO

Who told you that?  He doesn't push

me, who told you, Mookie tell you

that?  I hold my own.

JADE

Forget about it, Vito.  Forget I

even brought it up.

VITO

Pino picks on me, but I don't let

him push me around.  Mookie tell

you that?

JADE

Alright already.

You're alright.  Just gimme my

DA MAYOR

I'd thought you might like these...

I guess not.

DA MAYOR

Ain't nuthin' like the smell of

fresh flowers.  Don't you agree,

Miss Mother Sister?

DA MAYOR

Summertime, all ya can smell is the

garbage.  Stink overpowers

everything, especially soft sweet

smells like flowers.

DA MAYOR

If you don't mind, I'm gonna set

right here, catch a breeze or two,

then be on my way.

58.

DA MAYOR

Thank the Lord, the sun is going

down, it's hot as blazes.  Yes Jesus.

ML

What can you say?

COCONUT SID

I don't know how he does it.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

ML?

ML

What?

SWEET DICK WILLIE

ML, hold this for me.

ML

That's OK.  At least my moms didn't

name me Sweet Dick Willie.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

ML

Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.

59.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

I didn't say nobody, I said you.

ML

Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like

that.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Yes you did.

COCONUT SID

Squash it.

ML

I just wanted to know who named ya

Sweet Dick Willie?

SWEET DICK WILLIE

It's just a name.

COCONUT SID

And what does ML stand for?

ML

ML stands for ML.  That's it.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now

you know how I got that name.

ML

Negroes kill me, always holdin'

onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.

COCONUT SID

I don't know 'bout you, but it's

too hot to fuck.

SWEET DICK WILLIE

Never too hot, never too cold for

fucking.

60.

EDDIE

Ice cream.  Ice cream.

DA MAYOR

Doctor, you know better to run out

in the street... Stop crying, son.

DA MAYOR

Doctor, there's nothing to cry

about.  You're OK.

LOUISE

What's wrong?

61.

EDDIE

Mayor knocked me down.

LOUISE

You should be ashamed of yourself.

DA MAYOR

Ma'am, the boy is just scared to

death.  What actually happened is

that I was minding my business when

I saw your son about to be run over.

I ran into the street to save him

and I had to knock him down to keep

the both of us from getting hit.

LOUISE

Eddie, is that the truth?

LOUISE

Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you?

LOUISE

I'm talkin' to you, boy.

DA MAYOR

Miss, the boy is fine.

LOUISE

What I tell you 'bout lying?

LOUISE

What did I tell you 'bout playing

in the street?

EDDIE

Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm

sorry.

62.

LOUISE

Get upstairs now.

LOUISE

And when your father comes home,

he's gonna wear ya little narrow

behind out too.

DA MAYOR

You didn't have to hit your son;

he's scared to death as it was.

LOUISE

I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.

I truly do, but I'll have nobody

question how I raise him, not even

his Daddy.

DA MAYOR

You're right.

JADE

Sal, that was delicious.

SAL

Anytime.

JADE

Thanks.

MOOKIE

I'll see you out.

JADE

See ya around.

SAL

Don't wait too long to come back.

63.

MOOKIE

Jade, I don't want you coming in

here no mo'.

JADE

Stop tripping.

MOOKIE

No, you're tripping.  Don't come in

Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.

JADE

What are you so worked up about?

MOOKIE

Over Sal, the way he talks and the

way he looks at you.

JADE

He's just being nice.

MOOKIE

Nice!

JADE

He's completely innocent.

MOOKIE

Innocent!

JADE

I didn't stutter.  You heard me.

MOOKIE

You should see the way he looks at

you.  All Sal wants to do is hide

the salami.

JADE

You are too crude.

MOOKIE

I might be, but you're not welcome

here.

64.

JADE

Stop trying to play big brother.

I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta

nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay

your rent and you're gonna tell me

what to do.  Come off it.

MOOKIE

One has nuthin' to do with the other.

JADE

Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your

little 250 dollars a week plus

tips...

MOOKIE

I'm getting paid...

JADE

...peanuts.

MOOKIE

Pretty soon I'll be making a move.

JADE

I truly hope so.  I'm tired of

supporting a grown man.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

As the evening slowly falls upon us

living here in Brooklyn, New York,

this is ya Love Daddy rappin' to

you.  Right now we're gonna open up

the Love Lines.  Hello, you're on

Love Daddy's Love Line.  No names,

please.  Let's keep it anonymous.

FEMALE VOICE #1 (VO)

Hi, Mister Senor Love Daddy.  I'd

kiss your feet every morning,

that's how much I love you.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

How nice of you.

FEMALE VOICE #2 (VO)

I think you have the sexiest voice

in the world.  All you have to do

is talk.

65.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

Love Line, you're on.

FEMALE VOICE #3 (VO)

You give me fever.

(she moans)

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

She's feeling it.

FEMALE VOICE #4 (VO)

Love Daddy, I'd work in Mickey D's

24, 7, and 365 just to call you my

own.  Give you all my money, honey.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

That was the last call for tonight

on Mister Senor Love Daddy's Love

Line.  I love you.  You I love.

MOTHER SISTER

Mister Mayor, I saw what you did.

MOTHER SISTER

That was a foolish act, but it was

brave.  That chile owes you his life.

DA MAYOR

I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I

saw what was about to happen and I

reacted, didn't even think.  If I

did, I might not have done it in

second thought.  Da Mayor is an old

man, haven't run that fast in years.

(MORE)

66.

DA MAYOR (CONT'D)

I went from first to home on a bunt

single, scored the winning run, the

bottom of the ninth, two out,

August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.

(he is warming up now)

Maybe I should be heroic more often.

MOTHER SISTER

Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get

happy.  This changes nothing

between you and me.  You did a good

thing and Mother Sister wanted to

thank you for it.

DA MAYOR

I thank you.

MOTHER SISTER

You're welcome.

MOOKIE

Sal, I don't care if you fire me

this exact minute, leave my sister

alone.

SAL

Mookie, I don't know what you're

talking about, plus I don't want to

hear it.

MOOKIE

Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade

alone.

SAL

Here, you gotta delivery.

MOOKIE

Is this the right name and address?

67.

SAL

Yeah, do you know 'em?

MOOKIE

No, just checking.

MOOKIE

Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

TINA

What took you so long?  Is it hot?

MOOKIE

Hot.  Hot.

TINA

Come in then.

MOOKIE

Tina, you are too slick.

TINA

How else was I going to get you

here?  I haven't seen you in a week.

MOOKIE

I've been working hard, getting paid.

TINA

Where's the ice cream?  The Haagen-

Dazs butter pecan?

MOOKIE

Shit!  I forgot.

TINA

Your memory is really getting bad.

MOOKIE

I just forgot.

68.

TINA

And I really wanted some ice cream

too.

MOOKIE

I can run out and get it.

TINA

No!  No!  You won't come back either.

MOOKIE

I can't be staying long anyway.

TINA

How long then?

MOOKIE

Long enough for us to do the nasty.

TINA

That's out.  No!  It's too hot!

You think I'm gonna let you get

some, put on your clothes, then run

outta here and never see you again

in who knows when?

MOOKIE

A quickie is good every once in a

blue moon.

TINA

You a blue-moon fool.

MOOKIE

Then we'll do something else.

TINA

What else?

MOOKIE

Trust me.

TINA

Trust you?  Because of trusting you

we have a son.  Remember your son?

MOOKIE

Trust me.

69.

MOOKIE

I'm gonna take off ya clothes.

TINA

Mookie, I told you already it's too

fucking hot to make love.

MOOKIE

Why you gotta curse?

TINA

I'm sorry, but no rawness is

jumping off tonight.

MOOKIE

No rawness.

MOOKIE

Tina, you're sweating.

TINA

Of course I'm sweating.  I'm

burning up.  It's hot, moron, only

a hundred degrees in here.

MOOKIE

Lie down, please.

MOOKIE

Hello, Mrs. Rampolla.

70.

TINA

It's cold.

MOOKIE

It's 'pose to be cold.

TINA

Later for you.

MOOKIE

Meda.  Meda.

TINA

What?

MOOKIE

Tina, you don't have a forehead,

you got a eight-head.

MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY (VO)

Yes, children, this is the Cool Out

Corner.  We're slowing it down for

all the lovers in the house.  I'll

be giving you all the help you

need, musically, that is.

MOOKIE (VO)

Thank God for thighs.

71.

MOOKIE (VO)

Thank God for buttocks.

MOOKIE (VO)

Thank God for the right nipple...

Thank God for the left nipple...

TINA (VO)

Feels good.

MOOKIE (VO)

Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better

than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice

cream?

MOOKIE

I'll be back tonight.

SAL

It's almost ready.

OFFICER LONG

What time you closing tonight?

SAL

Ten.

SAL

Here you go.

SAL

Nine-fifty.

OFFICER PONTE

SAL

OFFICER LONG

Vito, Pino, see ya later.

MOOKIE

Sal, if you want me to deliver any

faster, get me a jet rocket or

something, cuz I can't run with

pizzas, all the cheese ends up on

one side and shit.

SAL

I didn't say nuthin'.  You must

have a guilty conscience.  What are

you guilty of?

MOOKIE

I'm not guilty of nuthin'.

SAL

You must be guilty of something or

you would have never come in saying

the things you said.

MOOKIE

C'mon, Sal.

SAL

Where we goin'?

PINO

Vito, I want you to listen to me.

I'm your brother.  I may smack you

around once in awhile, boss you

around, but I'm still your brother.

73.

VITO

I know this.

PINO

I love you.

VITO

I'm listening.

PINO

Good.  I want you to listen.

VITO

Jesus Christ on the cross, I said

I'm listening.

PINO

Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook

too much.  So does Pop.

VITO

Mookie's OK.

PINO

You listening to me?

VITO

Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm

listening ten fucking times already.

PINO

Mookie is not to be trusted.  No

Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The

first time you turn your back,

boom, a knife right here.

(Pino gestures)

In the back.

VITO

How do you know this?

PINO

I know.

VITO

You really think so?

PINO

I know so.  He, them, they're not

to be trusted.

VITO

So what do you want me to do?

74.

PINO

Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned

already, so we have to look out for

him.

VITO

I like Mookie a lot.

PINO

And that's exactly what I'm talkin'

'bout.

SAL (OS)

Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.

PINO

Be right there, Pop.  Listen to

what I said.

VITO

You don't listen to me, never have.

Just run your big fucking mouth

always playing big brother.  You

don't listen, but Mookie does.

BUGGIN' OUT

RADIO RAHEEM

I almost had to yoke him this

afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio

Raheem, to turn my music down.

Didn't even say please.  Who the

fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone

and shit.

BUGGIN' OUT

He makes all his money off us Black

people and I don't see nuthin' but

Italians all up in there, Sylvester

Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see

what I'm saying, homeboy?

RADIO RAHEEM

Talk to me.

BUGGIN' OUT

We shouldn't buy a single slice,

RADIO RAHEEM

MOOKIE

Sal, it's almost quitting time so

please start counting my pay.  I

SAL

We did good business today.  We got

a good thing going.  Nothing like a

family in business working together.

One day the both of you will take

over...and Mookie, there will

always be a place for you at Sal's

Famous Pizzeria.  Y'know, it should

be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria.

SAL

We're about to close.

AHMAD

Just four slices, regular slices.

Please.  To go!

SAL

OK, but that's it.  It's been a

long day.

77.

MOOKIE

Look, I want you to get your

slices, then outta here.  No

playing around.

AHMAD

You got it.

MOOKIE

Good.  No joke.  We all wanna go

SAL

BUGGIN' OUT

What did I tell ya 'bout dem

SAL

What da fuck!  Are you deaf?

BUGGIN' OUT

No, are you?  We want some Black

people up on the Wall of Fame.

SAL

Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We

ain't in Africa.

BUGGIN' OUT

Why it gotta be about jungle music

and Africa?

SAL

It's about turning that shit off

and getting the fuck outta my

pizzeria.

PINO

Radio Raheem.

RADIO RAHEEM
