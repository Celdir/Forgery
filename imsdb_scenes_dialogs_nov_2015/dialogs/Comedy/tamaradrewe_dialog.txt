his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He

falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.

Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.

GLEN (CONT'D)

Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming

of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill
