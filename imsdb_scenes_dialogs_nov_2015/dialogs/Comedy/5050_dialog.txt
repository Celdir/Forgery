RECEPTIONIST

Can I help you?

ADAM

I have an appointment.

RECEPTIONIST

Name?

ADAM

Adam Schwartz.

2.

ADAM (CONT'D)

(CONFUSED)

Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?

ADAM (CONT'D)

Oh, should I go sit?

RECEPTIONIST

Adam Schwartz.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

Adam Schwartz.

ADAM

Yeah, that's me.

RECEPTIONIST

Follow me.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

Put this on.

ADAM

Do I need to take off all my

clothes?

ADAM (CONT'D)

I'll figure it out.

3.

NURSE JOANNE

Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice

to meet you.

ADAM

You don't happen to have anything

in a cotton blend?

NURSE JOANNE

(LAUGHS)

Cotton. You're funny.

NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)

Now I'm going to need you to fill

this cup with urine. You think you

can do that?

ADAM

You want me to fill this entire

cup.

JOANNE

Yup.

ADAM

It's gonna take me at least a week

to fill this. Can I take it home?

JOANNE

(LAUGHS)

Take it home. You're so funny.

JOANNE (O.S.)

You okay in there Adam?

4.

ADAM

Just another minute.

JOANNE

Here comes the choo-choo!

TECHNICIAN

(AUTHORITATIVELY)

Now make sure you lie completely

still. Otherwise we'll have to do

it all over again. Which we're not

going to have to do, right?

ADAM

Hello? Is anybody out there?

5.

ADAM (CONT'D)

I have to pee.

SUPER: JUNE

6.

RACHEL

(asleep and incoherent)

Make it stop.

ADAM

(WHISPERS)

It won't turn off.

ADAM (CONT'D)

(WHISPERS)

Sorry.

RACHEL

Mmmmm.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Oh my god.

ADAM

What?

RACHEL

I think you have a gray hair.

ADAM

Really?

RACHEL

I'm gonna pull it out.

7.

ADAM

No! Don't touch it.

SETH

Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?

8.

ANDREW

Hey Adam.

ADAM

(SEEMS ANNOYED)

Hey Andrew.

ANDREW

Sorry about the noise last night.

SETH

Yo.

ADAM

Yo.

SETH

...What's that smell?

(SNIFFS ADAM)

Are you wearing perfume?

ADAM

No.

SETH

Well, you smell like the cast of

Steel Magnolias.

ADAM

(SMELLS HIMSELF)

I ran out of shampoo. I had to use

Rachel's.

SETH

For a second there I thought maybe

you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.

ADAM

Can you unlock my window? There's a

lot of pollen in the air.

9.

ADAM (CONT'D)

(ANNOYED)

Seriously, my allergies are flaring

up. It feels like my nasal cavities

are on fire.

SETH

Sorry music's too loud, it's making

it hard for me to hear your

whining.

SETH

I don't get it, that guy is clearly

a total douchebag...He's wearing

Capris!

ADAM

Rachel and I used to be like that;

like two wild animals in heat...

(THINKS)

I guess it is only natural though,

as we get older, more mature,

things begin to slow down.

(BEAT)

Sex every three weeks is normal?

Right?

SETH

(IN SHOCK)

You haven't had sex in three weeks?

ADAM

(SHRUGS)

You think maybe she's mad cause I

haven't asked her to move in?

SETH

What the fuck are you talking

about? I don't think she's waiting

for you to ask anything. You're

using her shampoo. Next thing

you'll be using her tampons.

10.

SETH (CONT'D)

But seriously, let me get this

straight - she has her own place,

yet she spends every night with

you, in your bed, but she won't

sleep with you?

ADAM

It's not that big a deal.

SETH

So when does it become a big deal?

Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My

cut off...4 days. That's when I

begin to worry.

ADAM

Do you realize how lucky I am to be

with Rachel?

SETH

Look around, there are like a

million Rachel's in this city

alone...well, she's kind of hot, so

maybe half a million.

ADAM

But they're not Rachel. I don't

know how to explain it, but being

with her just feels right. And I'm

not going to overlook that just

cause we're in a lull.

SETH

My parents are in a lull, which is

what happens after 35 years of

marriage. You've only been dating

her four months. At our age sex is

all we have. Every time she refuses

to sleep with you a small piece of

every man's soul dies. She's

killing us Adam...You're a semi-

smart, semi-successful, semi-

average looking dude. Just based on

that you could get with at least

one third of the female population.

BARISTA

Morning gentlemen.

11.

SETH

(TO BARISTA)

Would you sleep with my friend.

BARISTA

Like, right now?

SETH

No just in general.

BARISTA

Yeah, I'd fuck him.

BARISTA (CONT'D)

Hey Demetri,

(RE: ADAM)

Fuckable?

DEMETRI

I'd let you blow me.

SETH

(TO ADAM)

See this is what I'm saying.

SETH AND ADAM

Good morning Jenny.

SETH

(UNDER BREATH)

I love you.

PHIL

Salutations gentlemen.

12.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Are you wearing perfume?

ADAM

It's Rachel's shampoo.

PHIL

(DECLARATIVE)

Fructis by L'oreal.

(IMPRESSED)

My wife uses that.

(TO SETH)

What are you wearing?

PHIL (CONT'D)

What is that?

SETH

Ah, mothballs?

SETH (CONT'D)

Looks like my group is here.

SETH (CONT'D)

See you guys later.

PHIL

How's the Origins exhibit coming

along?

ADAM

We're almost done with Upper

Paleolithic.

PHIL

I'm counting on you not to screw

up.

(looks into Adam's eyes)

You're the only one I can trust.

(BEAT)

(MORE)

13.

PHIL (CONT'D)

The Board is talking about bringing

in sponsors...We're a dying art

Adam.

ADAM

Phil?

PHIL

Yeah?

ADAM

I should probably get to work.

PHIL

That's probably a good idea.

PHIL (CONT'D)

I think I'm gonna go to lunch.

ADAM

Greg. What are you doing?

GREG

It's a velociraptor.

ADAM

Where did it come from?

GREG

The dinosaur exhibit.

(off Adam's look)

Why can't we just say it was the

first domesticated pet?...People

love dinosaurs.

14.

ADAM

Greg you can't just...that's a 75

million year old fossil...just

please, put it away before someone

sees it.

SETH

Coming up here on our left is the

"Origins of Man" exhibit on loan

from the Smithsonian Institute. It

won't be open to the public for a

few more months, so you're one of

the first groups to see it.

(SPOTS ADAM)

Adam!

SETH (CONT'D)

Everyone this is Adam, he's the

curator of ancient civilizations

here at the museum.

ADAM

Hey kids.

SETH

(TO ADAM)

Why don't you tell us what we're

looking at.

ADAM

(BEGRUDGINGLY)

This here is a family of homo

sapiens who lived in Europe about

25,000 year's ago...

15.

ADAM (CONT'D)

...these Cro Magnon's as they're

often called, are the closest in

the evolutionary chain to modern

day humans...

ADAM (CONT'D)

...What made Cro Magnon so advanced

was their sense of community...they

were the first to settle on a

single plot of land, devote to one

partner, raise a family, and take

care of the sick.

KID 1

(TO SETH)

This is lame! I thought you said we

were gonna see dinosaurs.

GREG

(TO ADAM)

See, I told you.

SETH

(IN EXCITEMENT)

Who wants to hear about the

caveman?

SETH (CONT'D)

Caveman. RRRRRR!

ADAM

This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the

Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000

years his ancestors dominated all

of Europe. But then about 30,000

years ago, Neanderthals began to

disappear, until one day, their

entire civilization was gone.

16.

GREG

What happened?

ADAM

Greg you know what happened.

GREG

I do?

SETH

Come on! Tell us what happened to

the caveman.

ADAM

Well no one knows for sure. But

it's suspected that because

Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman,

he roamed the land, only fending

for himself - never learning to

cohabitate with others. So as Cro

Magnon families settled into

Europe, they took over the land.

One by one, Neanderthal was pushed

out...and never seen, or heard from

again.

SETH

(game show voice)

That's quite a story. Thank you

Adam.

SETH (CONT'D)

(Quietly to Adam)

You really know how to win a crowd.

ADAM

(to the kids)

But you never know, just cause they

vanished doesn't mean they're gone.

For all we know, there could be a

Neanderthal walking among us right

now. And by the looks of this guy

HERE -

(points at Neanderthal)

I'd say he probably plays defense

for the Raiders.

KID 1

This sucks ass.

17.

SETH

I see dinosaurs.

DR. ROSS

(into the dictaphone)

Patient has been complaining of

excessive urination, back pain, and

night sweats. Blood tests and urine

analysis are normal. MRI indicates

a massive intraduaral extradural

MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA

neurofibrosarcomas extending into

psoas muscle with nerve root

compression syndrome and bone

erosion.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

Growth extends from the L2 to L5.

Cytotoxic antibiotics are

recommended.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

Yes. Questions?

ADAM

(DUMBFOUNDED)

I have no idea what you just said.

Is there something wrong with me?

18.

DR. ROSS

(points to MRI)

If you look here on your MRI, you

see this cephalopod like object

spreading down along your spinal

column?

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

That is a massive schwannoma

neurofibrosarcomas.

ADAM

I still have no idea what you're

talking about.

DR. ROSS

It's a malignant tumor.

ADAM

What?!...A tumor? No.

DR. ROSS

I'm afraid so.

ADAM

How is that possible?...I don't

smoke. I don't drink. I eat

healthy...I even recycle.

DR. ROSS

Well Adam it's actually quite

fascinating. Your cancer is the

result of an incredibly rare gene

mutation in chromosome 17p in the

p53 Gene that causes the growth of

malignant cells in tissue around

the nerves. In your case it's grown

along the nerves in your lower

spine.

ADAM

(still in denial)

But, look at me. I don't look sick.

DR. ROSS

Cancer often has no specific

symptoms. People can go years with

out knowing they're sick. We're

lucky we caught it before it

metastasizes.

(MORE)

19.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

I'm going to put you on a 4 month

regimen of chemotherapy. It's an

aggressive dosage so you might want

to think about taking some time off

from work.

ADAM

Can't you just cut it out of me?

DR. ROSS

Yes, that is an option. But because

the tumor has spread to a such

significant size. Cutting it out

now would be risky.

ADAM

Well what are my chances of beating

this?

DR. Ross

Listen, you're in good hands. The

best thing for you to do right now

is to not worry...Let me do the

worrying. Alright?

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

Maybe you should talk to someone.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

We have a whole department of

psychologists here in the hospital.

They specialize in cases...in

these...sort of matters. They'll be

able to help you.

20.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

Hang in there champ.

LIBRARIAN

Hey bro, time's up.

ADAM

Can I have just a few more minutes?

LIBRARIAN

Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit.

(EMBARRASSED)

Rules.

21.

RACHEL (O.S.)

Adam? Is that you?

RACHEL (CONT'D)

(in a Hungarian accent)

Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made

vegetarian goulash.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

(still using accent)

What is wrong?

ADAM

Nothing.

RACHEL

(still using accent)

Liar.

ADAM

We need to talk.

RACHEL

Why? What's going on?

ADAM

I had a doctor's appointment today.

RACHEL

(WORRIED)

What kind of doctor's appointment?

ADAM

Have you ever seen the movie

"Beaches"?

RACHEL

You mean with Bette Midler?

22.

ADAM

Yeah that one.

RACHEL

Not as good as "The Rose", but

good.

ADAM

Remember the end of "Beaches"?

RACHEL

(CONFUSED)

Yeah. Sad....What does that have to

do with you?

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Oh. Oh my god.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

What kind?

ADAM

I don't know.

RACHEL

You don't know?

ADAM

Well I do know, but I can't

pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or

something.

RACHEL

Well how bad is it?

ADAM

It's not good.

RACHEL

(begins to cry)

You have cancer.

23.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Not now.

ADAM

I just think it's an interesting

time to take up smoking again.

RACHEL

Adam I'm 24 years old!

(CATCHES HERSELF)

You're 25.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

What are we going to do? I don't

know what to do.

ADAM

Sshhhh. Everything's going to be

alright Yammy. I'm going to start

chemo in a few days.

(POSITIVE)

We're going to get through this.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Ugh...and my parents are coming

over for dinner.

RACHEL

Do they know?

ADAM

No.

24.

SMASH CUT:

ADAM

3...2...1...

ADAM (CONT'D)

(BIG SMILE)

Hey.

EDITH

(EXCITED)

There they are!

EDITH (CONT'D)

I can't wait to hear the big news.

ADAM

Where's dad?

ART

I found your cat playing in the

neighbors yard.

ADAM

Dad, I don't have a cat.

EDITH

So what's for dinner?

25.

RACHEL

If I had known you were coming I

would have made something else.

EDITH

I'm just glad to finally be sharing

a shabbat dinner with my son...

(looks at her plate)

So this isn't meat?

RACHEL

No it's called sei-tan.

ADAM

It's made of wheat gluten.

EDITH

But it's not meat.

RACHEL

No, but it has a texture just like

meat.

EDITH

(INSINCERE)

Mmmmm. It's Good.

EDITH (CONT'D)

Art, take your pills.

EDITH (CONT'D)

Swallow.

EDITH (CONT'D)

So? Did you set a date?

26.

RACHEL

(CONFUSED)

A date?

EDITH

(TO ADAM)

Do not do summer like your cousin,

remember how awful that was?

Schlepping around in the heat like

that. Plus the bugs and the gnats.

ADAM

(whispers to Rachel)

What is she talking about?

EDITH

And now Rachel. I know we haven't

discussed this, but are you going

to convert?

RACHEL

(whispers to Adam)

She thinks we're getting married.

ADAM

Mom. We're not getting married.

EDITH

Oh thank god.

(TO RACHEL)

No offense.

(TO ADAM)

So then what's the big news that

you made us rush all the way over

here.

ADAM

Have you ever seen "Terms of

Endearment"?

RACHEL

Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.

EDITH

Tell me what?

ADAM

Alright fine. But, before I tell

you, you have to promise me you're

going to stay calm.

27.

EDITH

Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic.

ADAM

Mom, just promise me. Okay?

EDITH

I promise...You make me out to be

some kind of irrational loon.

ADAM

(MUMBLES)

I have cancer.

EDITH

What?

ADAM

(MUMBLES)

I have cancer.

EDITH

(TO RACHEL)

What is he saying?

ADAM

(takes a deep breath)

I have cancer.

EDITH

Cancer? What do you mean you have

cancer?

ADAM

I - HAVE - CANCER.

EDITH

I don't understand.

ADAM

Mom, I have a giant tumor in my

spine.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Mom?

28.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Mom, what are you doing?

EDITH

I'm making you green tea.

ADAM

Please, will you come sit down.

EDITH

I saw on the Today Show that it

reduces your risk of getting cancer

by fifteen percent.

ADAM

Mom, I already have cancer.

EDITH

Here take these.

EDITH (CONT'D)

Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor,

Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer.

ADAM

Mom, please, stop. I don't need

these.

EDITH

(YELLS)

Just take the god-damn pills.

ADAM

Mom.

EDITH

How could this happen?

29.

ADAM

It's genetic.

EDITH

Genetic? It must be from your

father's side of the family,

they're always getting sick. Your

uncle Bobby just got Crohns.

ART

That's a disorder of the bowels,

son. How are your bowels?

ADAM

The problem is not with my bowels.

ART

You're a lucky man.

ADAM

Thanks dad.

EDITH

I'm moving in.

ADAM

What? No. Absolutely not.

EDITH

Adam, I'm your mother, and I need

to be close to you in your time of

need.

ADAM

That's a terrible idea.

EDITH

Well who's going to take care of

you?

ADAM

Mom, I'm fine.

EDITH

I think I have a right to take care

of my son with cancer.

ADAM

It's nothing. Really.

30.

EDITH

Nothing! You tell me you have

cancer of the spine and now you

tell me it's nothing.

RACHEL

Edith, I can't even imagine how

hard this must be for you. But I

promise, there's nothing for you to

worry about. I'm going to be here

every step of the way, to help take

good care of your son.

EDITH

(TO ADAM)

You're a very lucky boy to be with

such a good girl. You know that?

You don't deserve her.

ADAM

I know.

ADAM

What's taking him so long? How hard

is it to buy a cup of coffee?

SETH

(quietly to Adam)

Look at how tight that shirt is.

She's totally aware of how large

her breasts look too. This morning

when she got dressed, she said to

herself - "I have these things and

I want the world to see them."

31.

GREG

What about that frozen drink,

what's that like?

BARISTA

(ENTHUSIASTIC)

The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute

heaven.

GREG

I don't know. Does it have a lot of

sugar?

ADAM

We've been here 20 minutes. What's

he shopping for a car?

SETH

Why are you in such a rush?

ADAM

Is this really how you want to

spend the rest of your life?

Wasting away in this place?

ADAM (CONT'D)

I don't believe it. Why can't he

just get a latte like he does every

morning.

SETH

Relax. We have plenty of time.

ADAM

No we don't have plenty of time!

Life is finite.

SETH

What the fuck is wrong with you?

ADAM

(QUIETLY)

I have cancer.

SETH

(LAUGHS)

Yeah right.

32.

ADAM

I'm serious.

SETH

Get the fuck out of here. You have

cancer?

ADAM

Maybe a little louder, you can make

a special announcement.

SETH

(QUIETLY)

When did this happen?

ADAM

Yesterday. They found a tumor in my

spine.

SETH

Who?

ADAM

What do you mean who?

SETH

Who found the tumor?

ADAM

Lewis and Clark...The doctors found

it.

SETH

When were you going to tell me?

ADAM

I'm telling you now.

SETH

If I had cancer I'd tell you right

away.

ADAM

What do you want the Better Friend

award? It's not an easy topic to

bring up.

SETH

Holy shit!

33.

SETH (CONT'D)

Okay, let's relax here.

(BEAT)

I think the best thing to do is to

look on the bright side.

ADAM

The bright side of what?

SETH

(EMPHATICALLY)

This is your chance to do all the

things you've always wanted. This

is it. This is your time to live it

up.

(A BEAT)

Plus, do you know how much pussy

we're going to get?

KATIE

(mouth full of food)

Can I help you?

ADAM

I have an appointment with Dr.

McRae.

34.

KATIE

Please call me Katie.

ADAM

(CONFUSED)

You're Dr. McRae?

KATIE

You were expecting someone else?

ADAM

Aren't you supposed to be like

sixty-five and wear earth toned

sweaters?

KATIE

(SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE)

Why? Did someone say that's what I

look like?

ADAM

No, no, no. I was just expecting

someone older.

KATIE

Sorry to disappoint you.

ADAM

No believe me, you're fine. Better

than fine, you're Dr.

McRae...you're a doctor? How old

are you?

KATIE

Twenty-six.

ADAM

Twenty-six? What are you like

Doogie Howser?

KATIE

Who?

ADAM

Doogie Howser...

35.

ADAM (CONT'D)

...The teenage doctor.

KATIE

Does he work here?

ADAM

No. Nevermind...but aren't you

young to be a doctor?

KATIE

I'm actually in my final semester

of medical school.

(off Adam's look)

This is a training hospital.

ADAM

So have you had many patients?

KATIE

You're actually my first.

ADAM

Oh.

KATIE

Please sit.

KATIE (CONT'D)

Dr. Ross filled me in on your

situation. Tell me, how have you

been feeling?

ADAM

Honestly. I feel fine.

KATIE

I think that's great considering

what you're going through.

ADAM

Yeah, but I tend to internalize

everything so, who knows.

36.

KATIE

ADAM

KATIE

ADAM

KATIE

ADAM

KATIE

ADAM

KATIE

ADAM

KATIE

ADAM

37.

KATIE

But there's a reason. You chose to

use humor rather than express how

you really feel.

KATIE (CONT'D)

In order to heal the body, you must

heal the mind. It's imperative that

you free yourself from stress and

anger. Get rid of all those

negative emotions stored deep

inside.

KATIE (CONT'D)

So today what I want to do is start

you on some very simple relaxation

therapy.

ADAM

Huh?

KATIE

I want you to lay back and close

your eyes.

ADAM

Lay here?

KATIE

Yes, I want you to just lay back,

and let go.

ADAM

Shouldn't we be analyzing my

childhood? Or my days as a call

girl?

KATIE

Another joke?

38.

ADAM

(SHRUGS)

Oh come on. Nothing? That was

funny.

KATIE

Ssshhhhh...

KATIE (CONT'D)

Close your eyes and relax. Find a

place inside yourself where you can

escape the cancer.

FADE TO BLACK:

RACHEL (O.S.)

Keep your eyes closed. No peeking.

ADAM

I can't believe you got me a

present.

(BEAT)

Is it that Prada handbag I've been

eyeing?

RACHEL (O.S.)

Even better.

ADAM

What is it?

RACHEL (O.S.)

Keep your eyes closed.

ADAM

You know how I feel about

surprises. Last surprise I got my

parents told me I was adopted.

39.

RACHEL (O.S.)

You're not adopted.

ADAM

Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was.

RACHEL

Okay. Open your eyes.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Surprise!

ADAM

(DISAPPOINTED)

What is it?

RACHEL

It's Noodle.

ADAM

It's so small. What do you do with

it?

RACHEL

(ANNOYED)

Adam, IT's a he, and HE's

adorable...Having a dog is supposed

to help with the healing process.

ADAM

Why, did it go to medical school?

RACHEL

(PISSED)

I thought you'd be happy...

ADAM

It looks like a gremlin. What

happens if you get it wet after

midnight?

ADAM (CONT'D)

(REASONING)

They're a lot of work.

(MORE)

40.

ADAM (CONT'D)

I can barely take care of myself, I

don't think I can handle another

living, breathing, needy, thing in

my life.

RACHEL

I didn't realize it would be such a

big deal.

(PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)

I can bring him back to the shelter

in the morning.

ADAM

I know what you're doing.

RACHEL

No, you're right, it's not a good

idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back

where he'll be kept in a tiny cage

with 10 other dogs who will bully

him, and rape him, and then he'll

eventually be euthanized.

ADAM

Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog.

RACHEL

Really?

ADAM

Really.

RACHEL

This is going to be so good for

you.

41.

PHIL

(ANNOUNCES)

There he is, the man of the hour.

ADAM

Here I am.

PHIL

Martini?

ADAM

No thanks.

PHIL

So cancer?

ADAM

Yup. The Big C.

PHIL

Man!

PHIL (CONT'D)

(WHISPERS)

Are you wearing a wig?

ADAM

Nope, this is my real hair.

PHIL

(SENTIMENTAL)

I'm gonna miss you so much buddy.

ADAM

(UNCOMFORTABLE)

I'm going to miss you too.

42.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Excuse me for a moment, I think I

see someone over there from a

previous life.

CUT TO:

JOE

Have you started chemo yet?

ADAM

No, not yet.

JOE

Don't do it man. It'll fuck you up.

That's like some Nagasaki shit.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

You want to know the secret?

ADAM

Ah, okay.

SUSAN

Eat nothing but green foods.

ADAM

Like a specific kind of green food?

SUSAN

No, any green food. It works, my

sister's friend survived lung

cancer.

CUT TO:

TED

(SUSPICIOUS)

So what kind of cancer do you have?

ADAM

Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas.

TED

Never heard of it.

43.

ADAM

It's pretty rare.

TED

Yeah well, you don't look sick.

ADAM

Cancer often has no specific

symptoms. People can go years with

out knowing they're sick.

TED

(SUSPICIOUS)

Huh.

CUT BACK TO:

SUSAN

There's spinach, zucchini,

broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green

beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi,

Zucchini,

ADAM

I think you already said zucchini.

SUSAN

(ANNOYED)

Zucchini...

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Are you paying attention?

ADAM

(caught off guard)

Uh huh.

SUSAN

Cause I'm only trying to help save

your life.

CUT TO:

44.

EDDIE

(SECRETLY)

There's this guy on the beach who

injects oxygen into your blood.

ADAM

Is that legal?

EDDIE

No, but it's totally safe.

CUT BACK TO:

SUSAN

...Brussel Sprouts, Turnip greens,

Asparagus, Celery, Cabbage, Okra,

Honeydew Melon, Limes, Green bell

peppers, green chiles...

CUT TO:

JENNY

(CRYING)

I can't believe that he has cancer.

SETH

I know, it's crazy.

JENNY

I've seen him every day for the

past two years and I've never once

made an effort to talk to him.

SETH

Well I'm his best friend, so

talking to me in a way is kind of

like talking to him.

JENNY

Oh what does it matter? It's too

late.

SETH

Wait. It's not too late.

CUT TO:

45.

GREG

Hey Adam.

ADAM

(less than excited)

Hey Greg.

GREG

My uncle had what you have.

ADAM

Really?

GREG

Man that was the worst.

ADAM

Your uncle had Schwannoma

Neurofibrosarcomas.

GREG

Yeah, I think so. It's the thing

with the toe and the screaming, and

everything tastes like olives?

Right?

ADAM

Well that was a nightmare.

RACHEL

Adam, those people just threw you a

party...They love you.

ADAM

Half those people don't even know

me.

ADAM (CONT'D)

What?

RACHEL

Nothing.

46.

ADAM

(SMILES)

What?

RACHEL

I love you.

ADAM

I love you.

RACHEL

Everything's going to be okay.

CUT TO:

ADAM

You are so unbelievably sexy.

RACHEL

I'm totally yours,

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Noodle.

ADAM

What?

RACHEL

The dog.

ADAM

Ignore him.

47.

RACHEL

I think he needs to go out.

ADAM

I'll do it after.

RACHEL

I can't do this with him barking.

ADAM

(to the dog)

Come on. Today...If I don't get

laid tonight because of you, I'm

going to take your little bow and

make a noose...

ADAM (CONT'D)

(PLEADING)

Please! I need this.

ADAM (CONT'D)

(EMBARRASSED)

Evening.

NEIGHBOR

Nice dog.

ADAM

Will you please just finish.

48.

RACHEL

Hold me.

ADAM

(UNDER BREATH)

Mother fucker.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Do you...want to move in?

RACHEL

Do you want me to?

ADAM

I was thinking it might be nice,

now that I'm not going to work

anymore. And with my chemo

starting...

ADAM (CONT'D)

You're here all the time anyway.

RACHEL

(SMILES)

Okay.

ADAM

(WHISPERS)

You wanna have sex?

RACHEL

(ASLEEP)

In the morning.

49.

EDITH

Art come on.

ART

I'm coming.

EDITH

We're late.

USHER

Please take your seats.

EDITH

What about those seats up there in

the front?

USHER

The service has begun.

EDITH

Please. My son has cancer.

50.

USHER

Please, follow me.

EDITH

(QUIETLY)

Sorry, my son has cancer.

ADAM

(QUIETLY)

Hi. Nice to see you.

ROSE

(CONCERNED)

Edith. How are you?

EDITH

(OVERDRAMATIC)

Oh Rose. Things are not well.

ROSE

I heard about the

(WHISPERS)

cancer.

EDITH

I can't tell you how hard it's been

on me. My only child. God only

knows what terrible thing I did to

deserve this. I've got a catatonic

husband and a son with cancer. Not

to mention my arthritis. I don't

know how I'll ever get through it.

51.

RABBI

Ladies and gentleman, Adam

Schwartz!

ADAM

Rabbi Jacobs.

RABBI

How are you son?

ADAM

Oh you know, just trying to live by

the Covenant.

RABBI

Don't bullshit me. You were the

worst student I ever had. I bet

you haven't even spoken a word of

Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah.

ADAM

I don't like to brag, but I

couldn't speak it then.

RABBI

Your mother told me about your

situation.

ADAM

I'm sure she did.

RABBI

It's not easy for a mother to see

her son go through something like

this,

ADAM

Nothing is easy for my mother.

RABBI

Have you thought about trying to

reconnect with the Torah?

ADAM

Honestly, I'm just here to make my

mother happy. It was either this or

I had to go see my cousin perform

in his high school theatre's

adaptation of "You've Got Mail".

52.

RABBI

Well think about it. I'm always

here.

ALAN ALDA

Hi there, I'm Alan Alda...

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

So you've been told you have

cancer. Well, you're not alone. 1

in every 3 people living today will

experience some form of the

disease...

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

You may be wondering what is

cancer? Well, cancer is a group of

more than 100 different diseases

characterized by the abnormal

growth of cells. These cells form a

lump or mass called a "tumor".

ALAN ALDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Cancer is treated through the use

of a revolutionizing medicine

called Che-mo-therapy.

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

Chemotherapy is a very serious

treatment.

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

It works by destroying cancer

cells; unfortunately, it cannot

tell the difference between cancer

cells and healthy cells.

53.

ALAN ALDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As a result, it's going to make you

feel tired...

ALAN ALDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And sick.

ALAN ALDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...You are about to embark on the

journey of a lifetime. So aim

high...

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

...and always remember, the road to

recovery is a team effort...

ALAN ALDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It's important that you talk openly

with your health care providers.

Ask questions so you can know all

the facts. Being prepared is half

the battle...

ALAN ALDA (CONT'D)

Toward helping yourself begin to

feel in control again...On behalf

of all the great folks at Mount

Sinai Hospital, I'd like to thank

you for your time...make it a great

day.

54.

GEORGE

Adam Schwartz.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Come with me my baby.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

This way my baby.

MITCH

That's Henry.

55.

ADAM

Is he okay?

MITCH

He's always like that.

ADAM

(TERRIFIED)

Is that going to happen to me?

MITCH

Best not worry about these things.

ALAN

(TO ADAM)

Want a hit?

MITCH

It makes it all a little easier to

handle.

ADAM

(PARANOID)

What if someone sees us?

ALAN

Don't be such an old man. Look at

this place, it's like Death Row in

here, they don't give a shit what

we do.

MITCH

How old are you?

ADAM

Twenty-five.

ALAN

You're lucky. Life only gets worse

anyway.

MITCH

Alan, stop it.

(TO ADAM)

Don't listen to him, he's just

messing with you.

56.

ALAN

No I'm not.

(TO ADAM)

It's all downhill from here. Trust

me. First your hair's going to fall

out, then your balls will shrink.

You'll marry a woman, or man,

who'll suck every penny out of your

savings and then leave you for a

fitness instructor in a teal Miata.

Then, to top it all off, your kids

will one day stop talking to you

because their therapist, who you

pay for, tells them you're the

reason they're so fucked up.

MITCH

You'll have to excuse Alan here,

he's going through a rough time.

ALAN

(TO ADAM)

I'm just being realistic. You want

some advice?

ADAM

Not really.

ALAN

Don't end up a victim like the rest

of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you

accept it, the better off you'll

be.

ADAM

I got to tell you, I was really

nervous about this whole cancer

thing, and then I met you guys, and

boy do I feel better.

ALAN

(TO MITCH)

I like this kid.

(TO ADAM)

I'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4

lymphoma. Pleased to meet you.

MITCH

Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate

cancer.

57.

ADAM

Adam Schwartz, schwannoma

neurofibrosarcomas.

ALAN

What the fuck is that?...Sounds

like the greek dish I had for

lunch.

ADAM

... man this pot is really strong.

MITCH

Medicinal.

ALAN

Good shit eh.

FADE TO:

CARNIE

Hey you! What do you think you're

doing?

ADAM

I want to ride.

CARNIE

Read the sign.

ADAM

I don't have cancer.

CARNIE

Then what's that?

58.

KATIE

So how do you feel after your first

treatment?

ADAM

I feel like I was just gang raped

by the Buena Vista Social Club.

KATIE

Is everything with you going to be

a joke?

ADAM

I'm serious. Have you heard their

horn section?

KATIE

Adam, you have a responsibility to

your mind and body.

ADAM

I was just injected with three

pints of kryptonite. Can we please

hold off on the new agey stuff.

KATIE

You can't just sit there and ignore

what's happening to you...You need

to stop bottling everything up.

59.

ADAM

What I need is for people to stop

telling me what I need.

KATIE

Have you considered that this

cancer is nature's way of telling

you to change the way you live your

life?

(off Adam's look)

...There's an old saying - you

can't change the wind, but you can

adjust the sails.

ADAM

They teach you that in medical

school?

KATIE

I know you don't like to talk about

your feelings, but you have to

learn to find an outlet.

ADAM

(FRUSTRATED)

An outlet for what? I have cancer.

KATIE

And how is your body ever going to

fight the stress of that cancer if

you can't even handle your own

emotions?

ADAM

Well excuse me. You'll have to

forgive me for not having a firm

handle on my emotions at this

particular juncture of my life.

KATIE

You don't have to be here.

ADAM

I'm sorry, I know you're only

trying to help.

(MORE)

60.

ADAM (CONT'D)

This is all too much for me. I

don't know what to do. Just tell me

what to do and I'll do it.

KATIE

I want you to do some homework.

Here's a list of books on mind-body

therapy. They should help you get

started.

SETH

(IN EXCITEMENT)

"Franz Schlegel is an American

`medical intuitive' and `mystic

psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings

are widely recognized as a global

spiritual awakening that is

transcending individual and

collective human consciousness"...

You're actually going to read this

shit? This guy is a fucking tool.

SETH (CONT'D)

Let's go to Mardi Gras!

ADAM

Why would we go to Mardi Gras?

SETH

Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's

like a giant orgy of the sexiest

women you can imagine all throwing

themselves at you, screaming to be

fucked. It's a fuck fest.

61.

ADAM

I'm getting chlamydia just

listening to you talk about it.

SETH

We need to go see the world.

ADAM

This isn't my bachelor party we're

planning here.

SETH

(FRUSTRATED)

Adam you can not let your cancer go

to waste.

ADAM

I'm not going anywhere.

SETH

Well if you're not going to take

advantage of your cancer, then I

will.

SETH (CONT'D)

Excuse me.

CLAIRE

Yes, how can I help you?

SETH

I'm looking to buy a few books -

CLAIRE

Oh.

(CONCERNED)

Are these for...I'm sorry it's none

of my business.

SETH

No that's okay. They're for my best

friend, Adam.

62.

SETH (CONT'D)

He's pretty sick.

CLAIRE

How awful.

SETH

Yeah. Cancer, not cool.

CLAIRE

Poor guy.

SETH

I know it's been really hard.

CLAIRE

It's bad isn't it?

SETH

Honestly?

(FEIGNING SADNESS)

Sometimes I just wish it was me

instead of him...to relieve some of

the burden, you know? I just...I

just want to help.

ADAM

What just happened?

SETH

(TO ADAM)

I'll tell you what happened. Cancer

happened, and you need to get on

the train.

63.

RACHEL (O.C.)

Adam do you know where the dog

leash is?

ADAM

Are you going to the park again?

ADAM (CONT'D)

This is the third time today.

RACHEL

He likes running around with the

other dogs.

ADAM

He can barely make it to the door

without shitting himself.

RACHEL

(TAKEN ABACK)

Are you smoking weed?

ADAM

Yeah.

RACHEL

Since when do you smoke?

ADAM

It's medicinal.

RACHEL

You got a prescription for

medicinal marijuana?

SETH

No, I did.

RACHEL

What's wrong with you?

SETH

Night blindness. Rods and cones are

off.

64.

RACHEL

Where did that TV come from?

ADAM

The store.

(off Rachel's furious

LOOK)

It's medicinal?

RACHEL

I thought we already agreed that my

painting was going there.

ADAM

(trying to reason)

Why can't we put up both?

RACHEL

You want me to put my painting next

to a television?

ADAM

(SHRUGS)

Yes?

RACHEL

(YELLS)

Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do

whatever you want. I'm taking your

dog to the park!...And open a

window. This isn't a dorm room.

ADAM

(calls out to Rachel)

Love you.

ADAM (CONT'D)

I don't get it, they spend all day

at the dog park.

SETH

Great. Maybe she'll move there.

ADAM

Can you not talk about her like

that?

65.

SETH

Are you joking? Do you see the way

she treats you?

ADAM

She's got some kind of creative

block...It's her process.

SETH

You have cancer for fuck's sake! If

I was your girlfriend, I'd be

baking you cookies and blowing you

every thirty minutes. Instead,

she's yelling at you over some

fucking painting. Her art sucks.

You don't want to put that on your

wall. It looks like someone threw

up a shrimp cocktail and then used

it to spackle the Berlin Wall.

ADAM

We're going through a rough patch.

That's what happens in

relationships.

SETH

(SERIOUS)

Bullshit. She's fucking you in the

ass Adam. This is the one time in

your life you can do whatever you

want. If you want to smoke weed,

then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat

screen TV, then get the fucking TV!

And if you want to go to Mardi

Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!

ADAM

We're not going to Mardi Gras.

SETH

(as he exhales)

You're totally missing my point.

ADAM

I've been reading your books, and

you know it actually makes

sense...Some of it.

(MORE)

66.

ADAM (CONT'D)

I'm not gonna lie, I don't really

get the "Dark Night of the Soul"

stuff. But I get it, years of

anxiety have taken over my body.

I'm blocked...emotionally.

KATIE

(EXCITED)

Adam! This is fantastic.

KATIE (CONT'D)

You know if you're interested,

there are some more advanced forms

of therapy that I think could be

really useful.

ADAM

Sure, if you think it'll help.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

Good morning class. Before we begin

I'd like to introduce Adam and

Seth, our two newest giggle gurus.

SETH

(quietly to Adam)

What are they laughing at?

ADAM

(quietly to Seth)

Just go with it.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

(to Adam and Seth)

Now what you'll soon discover is

the true miracle and gift of

laughter.

(MORE)

67.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)

Learning to laugh at ourselves and

others through non- judgemental

means is far more effective than

any prescription drug, or,

rehabilitation center.

You see, when we laugh, our bodies

release endorphins that not only

support the immune system, but also

release deeply stored emotional

pain, and give us a fresh new

outlook on life.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)

We don't tell jokes here, we tell

the truth - and we laugh at that

truth.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)

So let us share. Adam, why don't

you tell us what brings you here?

LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)

We're all friends here in the

Laughter Pagoda.

ADAM

I, ah, have cancer.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh.

Everyone. Beverly, share -

BEVERLY

Yesterday, I confiscated my son's

pornography collection and then

used it to masturbate 6 times.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

Paul, share,

PAUL

My wife told me she's a lesbian.

And then left me for my sister.

68.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

JIM -

JIM

(GLUM)

I owe two men eight grand by

Friday.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

SETH -

SETH

My best friend is a giant pussy.

ADAM

My best friend's favorite band is

Abba.

SETH

(DEFENSIVE)

When I was 12.

LAUGHTER THERAPIST

(HYSTERICAL)

Abba! Wonderful. I love it. Seth

laugh.

SUPER: JULY

FADE TO:

ALAN

(CONFIDENT)

Real.

69.

MITCH

Fake.

ADAM

Fake.

ALAN

You're both wrong. I think I know

real when I see it.

ALAN (CONT'D)

God damn it.

MITCH

How come we've never met Rachel?

ALAN

Yeah. What the fuck?

ADAM

She's been really stressed lately,

ADAM (CONT'D)

If I brought her here, she'd

probably freak out.

ALAN

Smart man. Save yourself the

headache.

MITCH

Don't listen to him Adam. It's

important to be with your loved

ones in times like these.

ALAN

Bullshit. Women are nothing but

trouble.

(MORE)

70.

ALAN (CONT'D)

They're selfish animals who only

add to the misery in your life. You

want to talk about a cancer.

MITCH

Listen to me Adam, I've been

married 40 years and it's my

Margaret who keeps me going.

MITCH (CONT'D)

She's my reason to live.

ALAN

That's precious Mitch, I almost

want to wrap it up and tie a little

bow around it.

(TO ADAM)

Honestly, I don't give a shit. You

can do whatever you want. It's your

life. All I know is that I'm not

going to spend my last days on this

miserable planet pining over a

woman. The day my wife left me was

the best day of my life.

RACHEL (V.O.)

Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing

something really important. I'll

give you a call when I'm

done...yay!

ADAM

(INTO PHONE)

Hey it's me, just checking to see

if you're on your way.

CUT TO:

71.

RACHEL (V.O.)

Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing

something really important. I'll

give you a call when I'm

done...yay!

ADAM

(INTO PHONE)

It's me again. Just checking to see

where you are. In case you're

looking for me I'm now on the other

side of the parking lot. Call me.

KATIE

Adam?

ADAM

(EMBARRASSED)

Oh hey.

KATIE

What are you doing?

ADAM

Just waiting for Rachel to pick me

up.

KATIE

What time is she coming?

ADAM

Uh, four.

KATIE

It's six thirty.

ADAM

She must be stuck in traffic.

KATIE

You want a ride?

72.

KATIE

Sorry about the mess.

ADAM

I think you should ask for a

refund.

KATIE

I know, I know. What can I say? I'm

not good at getting rid of things.

I get easily attached.

ADAM

Yeah, I can see.

KATIE

So you don't drive?

ADAM

Nope.

KATIE

But you have a license?

ADAM

Nope.

(BEAT)

I actually failed my test.

KATIE

No!

ADAM

(EMBARRASSED)

It's true.

KATIE

But, I thought you can re-take the

test.

ADAM

Eh. Let's just say, that the state

of California felt it was best I

didn't.

KATIE

What did you do?

73.

ADAM

I kind of backed my mom's car down

an embankment...Into the Balboa

cactus garden.

KATIE

The garden with all the endangered

plants?

ADAM

They didn't want to tow it out in

fear of destroying more of the

vegetation, so they had to use a

giant crane.

KATIE

I'm sorry. That's terrible.

ADAM

(ABRUPT)

Stop the car.

KATIE

Why what's wrong?

ADAM

Just stop the car.

KATIE

What are you doing?

ADAM

I can't handle all this mess.

KATIE

Wait, no, not that, that's my

dinner.

74.

ADAM

You can drive.

ADAM

Thanks for the ride...

ADAM (CONT'D)

Do you want to come in. For a

beverage? Or something?

KATIE

It probably wouldn't be very

professional of me.

ADAM

Come on, I'll let you analyze my

Id.

KATIE

Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.

KATIE

You know you are terrible at this?

ADAM

I've never played before.

KATIE

This is your Playstation.

ADAM

Doesn't mean I play it. Games these

days today are so complicated.

(RE: CONTROL)

(MORE)

75.

ADAM (CONT'D)

There's too many buttons. I can't

keep track of what does what.

KATIE

(LAUGHS)

Perhaps you'd prefer something a

little more simple. Maybe a nice

game of Connect Four or Bingo.

ADAM

She has a sense of humor.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Duck Hunt, now that was a game.

You know why? One button.

ADAM (CONT'D)

You think I'm kidding. My dad and I

used to have Duck Hunt tournaments.

He was actually really good.

(BEAT)

Until he had his stroke.

KATIE

That must have been hard, seeing

him lose his cognitive skills like

that.

ADAM

Well the funny thing is that the

stroke actually made him a better

player, he just lost interest.

KATIE

You've never talked about your dad.

ADAM

Well whose fault is that? Doctor?

KATIE

Hey!

76.

KATIE (CONT'D)

Rematch?

ADAM

You ever had this stuff.

KATIE

No, but it's supposed to be really

good for you.

ADAM

Well it smells like my grandmother.

KATIE

You complain a lot.

ADAM

You haven't met my mother.

It's a miracle I do anything but

complain.

KATIE

I try not to look at the world like

that.

ADAM

The world would be a boring place

if we didn't complain. Come on.

There's got to be something. One

thing, just one thing, that drives

you nuts.

KATIE

Hmmm.

(FISHING)

I really don't like it when people

at work finish all the coffee and

don't refill the pot.

ADAM

It's infuriating right?

77.

KATIE

I wouldn't say infuriating. It's

just not good work place etiquette.

ADAM

To complaining.

KATIE

Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so

sorry.

KATIE (CONT'D)

Hold on. I'm so sorry.

ADAM

Is it all gone?

RACHEL (O.C.)

Adam?

KATIE

I should probably be going.

RACHEL

Adam?

ADAM

Finally. Where have you been?

RACHEL

(MAD)

I hope I'm not interrupting.

78.

ADAM

Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my

therapist.

RACHEL

(SUSPICIOUS)

This is your therapist?

KATIE

Please, call me Katie.

RACHEL

(SUSPICIOUS)

OK. Katie. What are you doing here?

ADAM

She drove me home. Ring a bell?

RACHEL

Ugh. Shit.

(SWEET/NERVOUS)

Thank you so much for doing that.

Life's been a little crazy lately,

which I'm sure Adam has told you

all about. I love those shoes.

KATIE

Thanks...

KATIE (CONT'D)

I'm going to go. I'll see you at

our next session Adam.

ADAM

Where have you been?

RACHEL

I was at the gallery.

ADAM

(PISSED)

You were supposed to pick me up. 8

hours ago.

RACHEL

I know. I'm sorry. I totally

spaced. With the opening only three

months away my head's just all over

the place.

(off Adam's look)

(MORE)

79.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

Don't look at me like that. You

know this is a hard time for me.

ADAM

You're right. Let me go back and

talk to the doctor - see if maybe

they can diagnose me with something

that better suits your needs.

RACHEL

(DEFENSIVE)

I'm not just some car service here

to shuttle you around!

ADAM

And my house isn't a summer camp.

You can't just come and go as you

please and not take some

responsibility.

RACHEL

And what is it that I'm not taking

responsibility for?

ADAM

This. Us.

RACHEL

I can't handle this! You make it

sound like I'm your wife.

ADAM

You know what I thought the other

day? That I might actually die

without ever having sex again.

RACHEL

I'm sorry if your cancer isn't

turning me on.

RACHEL (CONT'D)

You think this is easy for me

seeing you sick like this? The past

few months have been hard on me

too. It's not always about you.

ADAM

(RELENTS)

I know.

80.

RACHEL

Why are you so good?

ADAM

You're my Yam.

RACHEL

What's wrong?

ADAM

I can't.

RACHEL

Why?

ADAM

I don't know what's wrong.

(DEFEATED)

It won't work.

FADE TO:

SUPER: SEPTEMBER

ADAM

Where's Alan?

81.

ADAM

Excuse me.

OLD MAN

How can I help you?

ADAM

Where am I?

OLD MAN

The After Life.

ADAM

This is Heaven?

OLD MAN

Pretty great huh? They've even got

a frozen yogurt machine.

ADAM

There are lines in Heaven?

OLD MAN

It's worth it.

82.

RABBI

So you want to know what's going to

happen when you die?

ADAM

I think it's a fair question.

RABBI

Fair yes, but impossible for me to

answer. Our deaths, like our lives,

have meaning and are all part of

God's plan. How should I know what

God has planned for you. Maybe if

you came to service once in a

while...

ADAM

Well am I going to go to Heaven?

RABBI

Probably.

ADAM

What if I want to just die? That's

it. No Heaven.

RABBI

That's like buying a ticket for a

cruise and then not going. The

Afterlife is where the fun begins.

ADAM

How can being stuck in some

nonexistent void with my

grandparents be fun. I spent my

entire life trying to get away from

my family, now I'm going to have to

spend an eternity with them.

RABBI

Adam, you can not look at death as

a curse. Even in death we are all

still part of God. Life on Earth is

just the beginning.

83.

ADAM

But that's not what I want.

RABBI

(FRUSTRATED)

Oy. Then find another religion. I

don't make the rules.

KATIE

You're being awfully quiet today.

Is everything okay?

ADAM

I'm going to die aren't I?

KATIE

What are you talking about?

ADAM

It's true.

KATIE

We don't know that.

ADAM

I'm not getting any better.

KATIE

Don't say that, you're doing so

well.

ADAM

Did you know that they found a

Quasar 7 billion light years away?

7 billion light years! It's more

than 3 billion years older than our

planet, and we're just seeing it

now; and you think I'm going to

live?

KATIE

(TOTALLY BAFFLED)

What are you talking about?

84.

ADAM

Cancer is an epidemic! It killed

Alan, it's going to kill me, and

it's going to kill millions more

after me. There's nothing anybody

can do.

KATIE

This is really good Adam. Let it

out.

ADAM

Will you stop!

(BEAT)

I can't do this anymore. It doesn't

matter. None of it. I'm going to

die and with nothing to show for my

life. 100 years from now my legacy

be will be that of just another

person dead of cancer. That's it.

KATIE

This helplessness you're feeling is

normal. These emotions you're

holding onto are what make you

human. But it doesn't mean you can

just stop living your life.

(BEAT)

Look at how you've grown over the

past few months, you can't just

throw it all away...Talk to me.

ADAM

I know you're only trying to help,

but this isn't working for me

anymore.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry.

SUPER: NOVEMBER

ADAM

I need a new lint brush.

RACHEL

Okay, I'll pick one up.

ADAM

And I have a doctor's appointment

next Thursday...The big one.

RACHEL

Am I getting fat?

RACHEL (CONT'D)

What?

ADAM

Are you listening to me?

RACHEL

(ANNOYED)

Yes.

ADAM

So you'll take me?

RACHEL

Of course.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHIL

You look great.

ADAM

Really?

PHIL

(INSINCERE)

Yeah, look at you.

ADAM

I want to come back to work.

PHIL

(IN DISBELIEF)

You want to come back? Here?

ADAM

What's so crazy about that?

87.

PHIL

You could be anywhere right now,

and this is that place?

ADAM

Yeah.

PHIL

Are you sure that's a good idea?

PHIL (CONT'D)

...Given...your current health?

ADAM

You said I look great.

PHIL

Yeah for a guy with cancer.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Alright, what the hell? I'd love to

have you back. Let's be honest this

place is falling apart without you.

ADAM

Thank you Phil.

PHIL

(SYMPATHETICALLY )

So you're really okay? I mean, the

cancer, is-

ADAM

Oh it's really good. We've come to

an understanding. It takes whatever

it wants and depletes me of my

every will to live, and I let it.

PHIL

Welcome back.

88.

SETH

And if you look over on your left

you'll see our newest exhibit "The

Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD

by the catastrophic eruption of Mt.

Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden

and forgotten until 1748 when

archeologists began to excavate the

site. Here we see exquisitely

preserved objects that offer a

glimpse into the day-to-day life of

this ancient city.

SETH (CONT'D)

This here is Adam, one of our

curators. Adam do you want to tell

us what you're working on?

ADAM

(UPBEAT)

Gladly. This here is a depiction of

what Pompeii's final 19 hours

probably looked like.

ADAM (CONT'D)

According to Pliny the Younger -

"You could hear women lamenting,

children crying, men shouting.

There were some so afraid of death

that they prayed for death. Many

raised their hands to the gods, and

even more believed that there were

no gods any longer, and that this

was one unending night for the

world."

SETH

Ok. Moving along we see the

beautiful watercolor paintings of

John James Audobon.

89.

ADAM

(AWKWARD)

I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs

me.

PHIL

You feeling okay? You don't look so

good.

ADAM

Could be worse. Right?

PHIL

(STARTLED)

Jesus!

PHIL (CONT'D)

Listen Adam...I don't know how to

say this...

ADAM

Don't worry...I get it. You're a

good guy.

PHIL

Come back when you're better. You

know you'll always have a home

here.

RACHEL (V.O.)

Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing

something really important. I'll

give you a call when I'm

done...yay!

ADAM

(SWEET)

Hey, it's Adam. Where are you?

Maybe you forgot, but my

appointment is today. So call me

back.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Fuck!

SETH (V.O.)

Yoooooo.

ADAM

Hey man, I need you to do me -

SETH (V.O.)

Not around. Leave a message.

91.

EDITH (O.S.)

(YELLING)

Hello,

ADAM

Hi mom.

CUTE NURSE

The Doctor wanted me to apologize

for running late, he's just in with

another patient, but should be out

in a few minutes. You guys holding

up alright?

EDITH

It's very cold in here. Is there

anyway you can turn down the Air

Conditioning?

CUTE NURSE

Unfortunately the temperature is

controlled by a central thermostat.

EDITH

My son has cancer.

CUTE NURSE

(FEELS BAD)

I'm sorry, really, if I could I

would, but there's nothing I can

do.

ADAM

(smiles to the Nurse)

Don't worry about it.

(Scowls at Edith)

I'm fine.

CUTE NURSE

Are you sure? I could get you a

blanket.

92.

ADAM

No, really, I'm okay. But thank

you.

EDITH

I'd love a blanket.

ADAM

(to the Cute Nurse)

We're fine.

CUTE NURSE

Okay, but you let me know if you

need anything.

EDITH

(Re: the cute nurse)

I don't like her.

EDITH (CONT'D)

You feel warm.

ADAM

I'm fine.

EDITH

Take these.

ADAM

(ANNOYED)

You're like some kind of deranged

pusher.

EDITH

Do you know what it's like to fear

losing your son? No. You don't.

When you have children of your own

we can discuss it. Now take the

pills.

93.

EDITH (CONT'D)

(DISAPPROVING)

Huh.

ADAM

What?

EDITH

Oh nothing.

ADAM

(ANNOYED)

What?

EDITH

It's nothing, he went to a state

college.

ADAM

You're unbelievable.

EDITH

I just worry that you're not

getting the best care possible.

ADAM

Well who needs a doctor when

they've got you and your fanny

pack?

EDITH

You can be a little shit sometimes,

you know that? You think I don't

know what's best for you? I birthed

you. You came out of me. I am your

mother, for better or for worse, so

accept it.

(Re: fanny pack)

You don't like this, well I'm

sorry. It's my own way of caring.

ADAM

(SNAPS)

Well stop! You're driving me crazy.

With the comments and the pills

every five minutes. Just stop. I'm

not dad. I can take care of myself.

94.

ADAM (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

EDITH

Yes you did. I drive you crazy.

ADAM

Mom.

EDITH

You're all I've got. Look at your

father.

EDITH (CONT'D)

I've lost him. My true love, gone.

I'm never going see him again, at

least not in this life.

(BEAT)

He spent his whole life priding

himself on his independence, always

too stubborn to ask for help and

now look at the son of a bitch.

(TO ART)

You happy? You like shitting

yourself?

ADAM

Mom!

EDITH

He was the greatest thing to ever

happen to me. And then I had you,

and that was even greater. So if I

hover and threaten your

independence, so what? You have a

mother who loves you more than

anything. Is that so awful?

ADAM

No. It's not.

95.

DR. ROSS

Sorry to keep you folks waiting.

It's been one of those days...car

got towed. Wife double parked it.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The

cancer's not responding to the

chemo.

DR. ROSS (CONT'D)

As you can see...The tumor is

continuing to grow here, along the

nerve.

ADAM

So what do we do?

DR. ROSS

We need to operate. If we don't

remove it soon we risk metastasis.

ADAM

But you said surgery was too risky.

DR. ROSS

We're out of options.

EDITH

But he's going to be okay, right?

You're going to fix it.

DR. ROSS

This surgery is no guarantee. The

risks are tremendous. And, even if

we're able to remove the tumor

there's still the chance that Adam,

you'll never be able to walk again.

96.

ADAM

Does that mean...I can get handicap

parking?

RACHEL

Hey you.

ADAM

Smells good.

RACHEL

The girls and I are having a movie

night. I somehow got suckered into

cooking.

(off Adam's look)

Don't worry I left you some.

ADAM

(SUSPICIOUS)

Who's that?

RACHEL

Susan. She wants to know what time

I'm coming over.

ADAM

(even more suspicious)

That's what she just texted?

(MORE)

97.

ADAM (CONT'D)

She wants to know what time you're

going over to her house?

RACHEL

Uh huh.

ADAM

Alright, well I'm gonna go lie

down.

RACHEL

I might be out late so don't wait

up.

ADAM

(TO SELF)

What the fuck?

RACHEL

What are you doing?

ADAM

Who's James?

RACHEL

My art partner.

ADAM

(re: text message)

He wants to know if you're still

coming over tonight. Should I tell

him you're having a girls night?

(CONTINUES READING)

Oh wait, you already told him to

bring the wine.

(LOOKS UP)

That's funny. It seems as though

you've double booked yourself.

RACHEL

I can't believe you just invaded my

privacy like that.

98.

ADAM

(READING PHONE)

Oh, you just got another text from

him. He says "Your skin is the

canvas upon which my dreams are

painted...

RACHEL

(FUMING)

Give me back my phone.

ADAM

(READING)

"Hope you're not too sore from this

afternoon."

(A BEAT)

He seems sweet.

RACHEL

Adam, it's not what you think.

ADAM

Well now how do you know what I'm

thinking?

RACHEL

Don't be like that. I didn't do

anything wrong.

ADAM

(SERIOUS)

You've been cheating on me.

RACHEL

Adam you're being ridiculous.

ADAM

Am I?

ADAM (CONT'D)

What's this?

ADAM (CONT'D)

And this? And this? And this? There

are over a dozen naked photos of

you in here.

99.

SETH

Hey guys.

SETH (CONT'D)

Bad time?

SETH (CONT'D)

(IMPRESSED)

Whoa! Nice! Now that I would put on

the wall.

(off Adam's look)

I can see you're in the middle of

something. I'll just be in the

other room.

RACHEL

It's a portrait series, commenting

on post-colonial patriarchy in the

Congo.

(off Adam's look)

...That's it. Nothing more.

ADAM

Have you lost your mind? I had the

most important appointment of my

life today and you missed it

because you were off with your "art

partner"...And what the fuck do you

know about Africa?

RACHEL

Oh shit. I forgot. Please, Adam,

I'm so sorry.

(CONCERNED)

What did the doctor say?

ADAM

Did you cheat on me?

100.

RACHEL

(CRYING)

Adam stop. Tell me what the doctor

said.

ADAM

DID-YOU-CHEAT-ON-ME!?

RACHEL

(POUTING)

Are you going to break up with me?

ADAM

No.

(BEAT)

I'm going to pretend you never

existed.

RACHEL

(CRYING HYSTERICALLY)

Please. I don't want to break up.

ADAM

You know, you have a pretty fucked

up way of showing your commitment.

RACHEL

I told you I couldn't handle this!

RACHEL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...I love you.

ADAM

I want you out my house.

SETH

Shame on you.

101.

SETH

Your skin is the canvas upon which

my dreams are painted?

ADAM

(DISGUSTED)

I know.

SETH

(BEAT)

Is "dreams" a metaphor, for-

ADAM

You remember the last time we came

out here?

SETH

Prom night. How could I forget? Jen

Zabrowski went down on me right

where you're sitting.

ADAM

That memory is so far from me,

SETH

Jen giving me a blow job?

ADAM

No, prom night. It feels like a

lifetime ago... I know it happened,

but that's it. It's like someone

else's memory.

SETH

You okay?

ADAM

I can't believe this is all

actually happening.

SETH

The girl or the cancer?

102.

ADAM

Both.

SETH

It's some pretty fucked up shit.

ADAM

You know, I used to think that I

was actually going to spend the

rest of my life with

Rachel...granted that might not be

so far off.

(shakes his head)

What a waste.

SETH

We need to get you laid.

ADAM

(ANNOYED)

Don't you ever give up?

SETH

No.

ADAM

Seriously, who's going to have sex

with me?

SETH

Some girls are into it?

ADAM

I look like Powder.

(BEAT)

Plus I have erectile

dysfunction...temporary. I hope.

SETH

Then let's go get me laid.

ADAM

I think I should drive.

SETH

You don't have a license.

ADAM

You're drunk.

103.

SETH

Do you even know how to drive?

ADAM

How hard can it be?

SETH

Hard enough that you don't have a

license.

ADAM

(SOMBER)

This might be my last chance.

SETH

Driving! You care about driving! We

could be on Everest getting high on

Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you

want to drive!...Forget it, I give

up. Drive.

SETH (CONT'D)

Hey Miss Daisy, will you please

watch where your going?

ADAM

What? I didn't see it.

SETH

That's what the mirrors are for.

SETH (CONT'D)

Turn right.

ADAM

I know what I'm doing.

SETH

Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE

WRONG WAY!

104.

SETH (CONT'D)

Adam! Turn the car around.

ADAM

No. I'm driving and I want to go

this way.

SETH

What the fuck is wrong with you?

ADAM

For once can you just shut up and

let me do this? So I'm driving the

wrong way? Big fucking deal.

SETH

You're an idiot.

ADAM

Get out.

SETH

This is my car.

ADAM

GET! OUT!

SETH

You're being a real douche.

SETH (CONT'D)

Adam, open the door.

105.

SETH (CONT'D)

Don't you dare call her. Not after

everything she's done to you.

SETH (CONT'D)

You're a pussy.

ADAM

Well you're a selfish piece of shit

who cares more about getting his

dick wet than actually being a

friend.

KATIE

Hello.

ADAM

I don't want to die.

KATIE

Adam?

ADAM

I'm 25 years old and I've never

even been to Canada. I haven't

lived my life!

(BEAT)

I'm really, really scared.

KATIE

should have never stormed out like

that.

KATIE

It was wrong of me to push you the

way I did. I wasn't listening.

KATIE (CONT'D)

I could never have handled all of

this the way you have.

ADAM

You mean like a complete asshole?

KATIE

I think you're really brave.

ADAM

If I don't die, I think we should

go on a date.

KATIE

Adam, I'm not sure if that's a good

idea.

ADAM

Why not?

KATIE

Not only am I your therapist, but

you're also my first patient, ever.

What kind of precedent would I be

setting?

ADAM

It makes for a nice incentive.

KATIE

I can't date you.

ADAM

(PLAYFUL)

Yes you can.

KATIE

No I can't.

ADAM

Yes, you can.

KATIE

No I can't.

ADAM

A wise person once told me - you

can't change the wind, but you can

adjust the sails.

I was able to expedite the wait for

your surgery. Your scheduled for

tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with

Dr. Lamb. Please call my office if

you have any questions.

MORTICIAN

Here at Linden we're more than just

a stopping ground for the deceased.

We understand that life is

different for everyone, and helping

families to see their loved ones

off to the hereafter means

approaching every funeral and

burial with it's own dignity and

care...A funeral is a representation

of the individuals time spent on

earth, so I ask you to reflect on

your inevitable interment and think

carefully in choosing the service

and tomb that best befits you.

SETH

What about a Viking funeral?

MORTICIAN

(INTRIGUED)

I'm not familiar.

SETH

(talking out of his ass)

You know, we put him on a boat...

cover it with...dirt

and...branches...whatever you can

find. We push it out...into the

sea...or the ocean...and then shoot

flaming arrows, boom! It catches on

fire...And that's it. It's awesome.

kidney? Right? Or is it the left?

Just kidding. That's doctor humor.

DR. LAMB (CONT'D)

Nurse Wong here needs you to sign a

few papers, so I'm going to leave

her to do her job, and I'll see you

after the surgery.

ADAM

What is all this?

NURSE WONG

Hospital liability and disclaimer

forms...in case they need to fuse

your spine or remove any organs.

You know, the usual.

ADAM

Oh, great.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Hello Adam, I am the

Anesthesiologist. I will give you

shot to make you sleep.

ADAM

Will you be here when I wake up?

KATIE

I'm not going anywhere.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Now relax, this will take a few

minutes to feel the effect.

About how long?

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Relax, you will soon begin the

sleeping.

Well what if it doesn't work. How

do you know I won't wake in the

middle of the surgery? What if I-

DR. HENRY

I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake

was a Buccaneer.

DR. LAMB

No he was a privateer.

NURSE SCOTT

I thought he was a pirate.

114.

DR. LAMB

A pirate works for no one but

himself. A privateer has a mandate

from a government.

DR. HENRY

I thought that was a buccaneer.

DR. LAMB

No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned

pirate.

DR. HENRY

Then what's a mercenary?

DR. LAMB

(FRUSTRATED)

Nurse Wong. Will you Google it?

CUT TO:

DR. LAMB

We were successful in the

extraction of the tumor. However,

as you can imagine, with something

of this magnitude...there were some

unforeseen complications. The bone

corrosion was much greater than

initially anticipated. We had to

remove part of the hip and pelvis,

as well as most of the psoas

muscle. We also had to remove a

good amount of sheath tissue around

the sciatic nerve, the damage to

that nerve is considerable, which

is going to hinder his ability to

walk...He's in stable condition

right now, but it's touch and go.

115.

ADAM

That is the most beautiful dresses.

Where did you get it?

DR. LAMB

Adam, I see you're awake.

ADAM

I'm here.

DR. LAMB

How are you feeling?

ADAM

I feel wonderful.

DR. LAMB

That would be the morphine.

DR. LAMB (CONT'D)

I want you to push this little

everything.

EDITH

This food's not going to eat

itself.

SETH

I got it.

ADAM

(TO SETH)

You mind?

ADAM (CONT'D)

Please. I think there's a red tide

or something. My eyes are all

itchy. It feels like someone is

rubbing sandpaper on my corneas.

SETH

(as he serves Adam)

Nope. You don't have cancer

anymore. No more special treatment.

ADAM

I am still in remission.

119.

EDITH

You gonna spend the rest of your

life complaining?

ADAM

(PROUD)

I like complaining.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
