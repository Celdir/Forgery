FREAKED

Tim Burns, Tom Stern & Alex Winter

SEVENTH DRAFT

January 12, 1992

RICK

Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie

Lee? One day I'm a hot young

movie star, and the next day I'm a

hideous mutant freak, covered with

festering lesions.

REGIS

Sounds like my wife when she misses

a mudpack!

KATHIE LEE

Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha-

ha!

(to Rick, she turns

EARNEST)

Ricky, once you were the all-

American boy next door, star of the

beloved Hey Dude films. Now the

very mention of your name makes

children scream in terror. We've

all read about your disturbing

story. But the people want to hear

it from you, Ricky Coogan.

(SFX: children scream)

Won't you tell us your story?

RICK

Well, it's kinda long, but okay.

It all started when I signed a deal

to be spokesman for the E.E.S.

conglomerate...

DISSOLVE TO:

2.

RICK

(through a clenched smile)

So, what kind of crap do you

scumbags want me to peddle?

HERTZ

Everything. Everything except

shoes, of course. Hah hah...

HERTZ

Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.

HERTZ

Helmet Head hair spray.

HERTZ

Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-

fertilizer.

RICK

Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not

do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a

star, got it, Hertz?

(to his aide)

Rico, give these misguided clowns

Tony Danza's phone number, and

let's get the hell out of here.

HERTZ

Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up

to the radicals trying to keep

Noxon from the struggling farmers

whose very future depends on it.

3.

RICK

(HESITATES)

Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?

HERTZ

Only in the U.S....and Europe.

RICK

But I heard that shit's lethal.

HERTZ

Rick, Rick, Rick... You want

proof? Fine. Just take a seat.

Please.

HERTZ

(TO RICK)

Meet the head of our South American

research facility, Juan Valdez.

GEORGE

My name is George Ramirez.

HERTZ

Whatever. He's worked with Noxon

24 every day for five years, and

he's in fine shape. Aren't you,

Juan?

GEORGE

Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in

Santa Flan have--

RICK

Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty

name for a country is that?

GEORGE

It is named for the patron saint of

creamy desserts... As I was

saying, we've worked very closely

with Noxon...

4.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I personally supervised its

development...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I performed rigorous scientific

tests. No potential danger was

left uninvestigated...

GEORGE (CONT'D)

The environmentalists are

crackpots, all of them.

GEORGE

It's ridiculous, I tell you.

Totally ridiculous!

HERTZ

Thank you, Valdez. That will be

all.

RICK

Wait a second--

5.

HERTZ

Ricky, this is important. We're

talking about a major threat to the

EES image. How does 2 million

dollars plus expenses sound?

RICK

Look, it sounds great, but--

HERTZ

I hear you. Make it five million--

(a new placard: 5 MILLION)

that is, if the board agrees ...

HERTZ

Good, it's unanimous. Well, what

do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's

"Man in Santa Flan?"

CUT TO:

X-RAY CHECKER

My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude

Three: The Final Countdown." We

need more wholesome role models

like you.

RICK

Uh-huh.

(TO HIMSELF)

Where the fuck is Ernie?

6.

ERNIE

Ladies! All I wanted was a

manicure! Yah-ha-ha!

(he sees Rick)

IT'S THE COOG!

RICK

IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF!

WOOF!

X-RAY CHECKER

(TO RICK)

Mister Coogan, is this your bag?

RICK

Yeah, why?

X-RAY CHECKER

Is this your kid?

RICK/ERNIE

Stuey Gluck!

STUEY

Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare

still from your high school

production of The Glass Menagerie!

Could you sign it for me?

Please?!

RICK

NO!

(TO ERNIE)

Let's get the hell out of here!

7.

STUEY

Rick! Wait up!

STUEY

Rick! Remember the speech you gave

at the Actors Forum for Social

Justice!?

RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)

If all the world is a stage, then

let us shine the spotlight on

truth, integrity, and a deep

compassion for all life.

RICK

Leave me alone, troll!

(TO ERNIE)

That was before I got an

entertainment lawyer.

ERNIE

Quick, down here.

STUEY

Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's

dangerous. Why are you lending

your name to it? What's happened

to you, Rick? You used to be

good! And now... I just don't

know...

RICK

Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.

8.

RICK

ALRIGHT!

CUT TO:

RICK

In the bag.

CAPTAIN (V.0.)

Ladies and gentlemen, this is your

captain speaking. To the right of

the aircraft, you can see a great

view of the Grand Canyon.

CAPTAIN (V.0.)

And to the left you can see a panic-

stricken little troll.

STUEY

RICK

AHHHHHHH!

9.

RICK

You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie?

ERNIE

Nah, you can have 'em.

CUT TO:

STUEY (O.S.)

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...

STUEY

Hey, I'm okay!

STUEY

OW!

CUT TO:

RICK (VO)

Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam.

World famous for loud music and hot

sex!

ERNIE (VO)

It is?

RICK (VO)

Give me a few hours.

10.

RICK

Sure glad that wasn't our plane.

PROTESTERS

EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic

crap away! EES mustn't stay!

(etc.)

ERNIE

Jesus! We better find the limo

before these whale kissers chop us

up and sell us for parts.

(he spots the limo)

There it is.

RICK

Wait a second...

11.

ERNIE

Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.

RICK

Forget them. I got a better idea.

If I can just find the right

disguise...

ERNIE

Coog, those hippies'll tear us

apart.

RICK

Hey, how'd you like to make a quick

hundred bucks?

ERNIE

He says the pants don't usually

come off for less than two-fifty,

but since you're so cute, he'll

make an exception.

FLIP TO:

RICK

RICK

Here.

RICK

Help! Ow! Give me back my

crutches! You monster! Oh, the

pain! The agony!

JULIE

Are you okay? Let me help you!

12.

RICK

Thanks. Don't worry about me.

What's one man's pain weighed

against the global injustice of

corporate tyrants like EES? Go.

The fight must continue.

JULIE

Wow... My name's Julie.

RICK

Josh. Josh Tavner.

ERNIE

Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.

ERNIE

Ow! Hey!

JULIE

Give me those, ape. Help him up.

JULIE

Hey Josh, a busload of us are

headed over to Maracas to protest

Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with

cow shit.

RICK

Same here! You could ride with us.

JULIE

Us? You're with him?

RICK

Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard

of an idiot savant?

JULIE

Sure.

RICK

That's Ernie. Except for the

savant part.

13.

CUT TO:

RICK

(faking terrible pain)

Ooooh, my pelvis.

JULIE

(SYMPATHETIC)

Is this better?

ERNIE

Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an

idea man myself. Like, let's say

there's a nuclear war, and the only

two people left are you and the

Pope... Would you pork him?

ERNIE

But one thing's for sure. That

Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?

JULIE

I'll say! What a total piece of

shit. Don't you think so, Josh?

RICK

(MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY)

Well, he's got a few problems.

JULIE

And what a lousy actor! I mean can

you believe that "Hey Dude" crap?

14.

RICK

Well, with a script that bad,

Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming

off as good as he did!

(CATCHES HIMSELF)

I mean, that's what I read.

JULIE

Well, he's no Christian Slater.

RICK

(EXPLODES)

SLATER!? I could act circles

around that one-note hack! He was

shittin' his diapers when I was the

toast of Broadway! I made grown

men cry! I made crippled children

laugh! Now all I ever hear is

Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL

SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR

ME?

RICK

You think Slater could improv like

this? Make you believe he was an

invalid!? Huh!?

ERNIE

(TO JULIE)

So, do you like Swedish films?

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP ON:

JULIE

You don't even want to hear the

truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan?

(MORE)

15.

JULIE(CONT'D)

I mean, look, I'm not saying this

stuff is going to turn anyone into

a... a...

RICK'S POV

RICK

(DISTRACTED)

Human worm...

JULIE

Right. A human worm. I mean,

that's just stupid. The point is--

RICK

Dog boy...

JULIE

Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.

BUT--

RICK

Hideous frog man.

JULIE

Okay, okay. Now you're just being

silly. Human suffering's just a

big joke to you, huh? You are

sick, Coogan!

JULIE

Cool! A freak show! Let's check

it out!

RICK

Kind of like a family reunion for

you, huh?

16.

ERNIE

Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.

CUT TO:

JULIE

Isn't it great? It's so "real"...

RICK

Real stupid.

(TO ERNIE)

Let's go. This place is dead.

ERNIE

Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?

VOICE (O.S.)

There are no weirdos here.

17.

ELIJAH

Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,

definitely. Children of Hell and

twisted masses of living, breathing

tormented flesh, certainly. But as

for weirdos... not a one. Unless

of course you count me! Ha ha ha!

RICK

Nah, you seem like a regular

dumbshit old redneck to me.

JULIE

I'm Julie. And you are...

ELIJAH

Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor

of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and

Mutant Emporium. But you knew

that. After all, you've ventured

miles away from civilization,

hospitals, telephones,

(TO RICK)

police... How may I help-you?

RICK

Drop dead.

JULIE

We'd like to see your freak show.

You see, only by appreciating the

variety and innovation of nature

can we come to respect the fragile

complexity of our global eco-

system.

ELIJAH

And you come to me looking for

weirdos?

ERNIE

Hey! What the--

18.

JULIE

(REPULSED)

Eeuuuwww...

(composes herself and

WAVES)

Ahem. Hello.

ELIJAH

Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As

for the show, I'm afraid the next

parade of deformity isn't until

tomorrow night...

JULIE

Oh, just our luck...

ELIJAH

However! I do have a private

exhibit in my shed you might enjoy.

I don't usually share it with the

general public...

RICK

We're deeply honored. But no

thanks.

ERNIE

Yeah. We really must be--

JULIE

The sideshow tradition has been

misrepresented by the media. You

don't traffic in human misery. You

show society the part of itself it

doesn't want to look at.

19.

ELIJAH

Yes... Yesm I see...

ERNIE

What the heck. We'll see some

pickled dog brains, maybe some

pictures of women with, you know,

added equipment.

RICK

And to think we could be in the

limo with those stewardesses.

ERNIE

What the hell, Coog, these people

are weird, but they seem nice

enough.

ELIJAH

AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-

HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-

HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-

HE-HE!

ELIJAH

HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family

Circus! How do they do it day

after day? It's amazing.

20.

THE STRAPS

RICK

(TO ELIJAH)

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?

ELIJAH

Well, I guess they do use the same

joke over and over. I'm just a

sucker for that little moffet's

shenanigans, that's all.

(he tosses the funnies

ASIDE)

But perhaps I should tell you a

little more about what I do. You

see, I not only exhibit freaks, I

make them. Just like Michelangelo

saw the angel in the stone, I look

at a guy like Kevin Costner and see

a giant peach grub who can fart the

Blue Danube!

(mops brow, asks

OFFHANDEDLY)

Am I crazy or is it hot in here?

ELIJAH

Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!

JULIE

My God! He's using Noxon Twenty-

Four!

RICK

Hey! You're not supposed to have

that stuff!

ELIJAH

Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed

to have these either!

21.

ELIJAH

I need only punch a few buttons on

this magnificent device, and it

gives me an easy-to-apply ointment

that will mutate a perfect young

body, bubble its skin, warp its

bones and twist its guts into AN

UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-

TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!

JULIE

Wait a minute. Does this mean

we're not going to see a show?

ELIJAH

(IGNORES HER)

Toad, fire up that machine, and

let's turn these hapless asswipes

into monstrosities!

RICK, JULIE, ERNIE

(TOGETHER)

AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

ELIJAH

Now let's see. Who wants to get

freaked first?

ERNIE

(points at Julie)

Ladies first!

JULIE

Go screw yourself!

ERNIE

If I were you, I would!

ELIJAH

Hmmmm.

22.

ELIJAH

(mumbling to himself)

It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...

two birds with one stone... Yeah,

it's pretty darn good, really...

ELIJAH

Let 'er rip, Toad!

ERNIE

Wait a second. You're really gonna

smear that stuff on us and mutate

our body parts!?

ELIJAH

Correct.

ERNIE

Well... then could you give me a

really big rodney?

ELIJAH

I'm a mad scientist pal, not a

miracle worker.

JULIE/ERNIE

Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!

(ETC)

THE SKIN:

23.

ELIJAH

Gumby! Put that thing away!

JULIE/ERNIE

ELIJAH

Feast your eyes!

JULIE

NOOOOO!

ERNIE

Well, at least I'll never have to

go far for a piece of tail.

JULIE

Pig!

ERNIE

Ouch! I was just trying to keep

things light. Oh God! Why me!?

JULIE

Mother always said there'd be days

like this. And I thought she was

nuts!

ELIJAH

(gestures to Julie/Ernie)

A mere party trick. But you,

you're gonna be special.

RICK

(GETS TOUGH)

Let me go, Skuggs, or else!

(MORE)

24.

I got some RICK(cont'd)

friends that'll come

down here and mess you up bad,

homey!

(Elijah chuckles. Rick

tries a different

APPROACH)

I got some other friends who can

score you box seats at the

Superbowl, no problem.

(ANOTHER FAILURE)

YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF,

YOU FUCKIN' APE?!

(switches gears again)

You ever had a hot fudge bath with

Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna]

ELIJAH

(LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)

You know her?

ELIJAH

Ah, screw it. I'd never get

anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP

THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!

ELIJAH

For years I've strived to create

the ultimate monster. The first of

a whole new generation of

superfreaks! Now I've finally got

you, the perfect subject--a real

asshole! HA-HA-

(he pauses and looks

closer at Rick)

Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy

from "Hey Dude Three-The

Beguiling?"

RICK

Yeah, that's me!

ELIJAH

You were great in that picture! Oh

well, I guess for the next one

they'll have to get Christian

Slater! HA-HA-HA!

25.

CUT TO:

RICK (O.S.)

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG!

DISSOLVE TO:

ELIJAH

This is Red Swan. May I speak to

the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll

hold.

ELIJAH

Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done

it! I found the perfect subject--

huge ego, shallow personality,

almost no moral values... A

lawyer? No, better. An actor.

Yeah, the guy from those hilarious

"Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--

26.

ELIJAH

(SHEEPISHLY)

Well, I liked 'em.

ELIJAH (CONT'D)

Right... Yes... Yes, I see...

But that's just it. He's not

quite, uh, finished. I need more

Noxon so I can--

ELIJAH

(ASIDE)

Geez, what a grouch.

ELIJAH

(to Laughing man)

Laughing Man? I have to go. What

about the Noxon? Two days? Great,

you can see everything then...

Yeah, you take it easy too.

ELIJAH

Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and

greet the new you.

RICK

Huh?

RICK

AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

CUT TO:

27.

RICK

Oh God! This was my good side!

ELIJAH

Still is if you ask me! Hell, even

half-done, you'll be the star of

the show tonight.

ELIJAH (CONT'D)

Welcome to your spacious

accommodations.

RICK

(IMPRESSED)

Great use of the space.

ELIJAH

I learned it all from Bob Vila.

BOB

You know you could expose those

rustic beams and put in a skylight

over one weekend, Elijah.

ELIJAH

Give it a rest, Bob!

ELIJAH

One of these days I gotta put a

shitter in there.

28.

BOB

No problem. It's all here in my

Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah.

And you pay nothing for thirt--

RICK

Ernie? Julie?

ERNIE

Over here, Coog.

JULIE

Are you alright?

RICK

I know that voice. That's the

voice that said,

(MIMICS)

"Cool, a freak show. Let's check

it out!"

JULIE

What!? Oh sure, blame the woman.

Typical.

RICK

(MIMICS)

"It's so real." Is this real

enough for you? I'm friggin'

Quasimodo!

ERNIE

Chill out, Coog. You're talking to

the original tag team of ugly

pukes. Step into the light.

RICK

Okay, here I come.

29.

ERNIE

ULP!

JULIE

Oh geez... It's not so (GULP)

revolting. After all, physical

beauty is just a socially-enforced

myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI

RICK

(OFFENDED)

Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas

yourself. You're lucky I've got a

strong stomach!

VOICE (O.C.)

And you're lucky I don't BITE you!

Heh heh heh heh ...

RICK

Get away from me you, you...

JUAN

Freak? Ha ha hahahaha!

(he stares hard at Rick)

I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of

the freaks.

JULIE

(walks up to them)

Kind of the "top dog."

JUAN

Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?

30.

RICK

No thanks. I don't plan on staying

long. How many of you are there in

here anyway?

JUAN

First, I have a question for you,

Ricardo. Who starred in the film

"International Velvet?"

RICK

Huh?

JUAN

Well, perhaps we should ask the

Worm!

JUAN

Tell us, Worm, who starred in

"International Velvet?"

THE WORM

Yes, yes ... very interesting...

International Velvet... The

perfectly appalling sequel to

National Velvet, I believe. No

dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.

JUAN

Yes, Worm. But who was the star?

WORM

Olivia DeHavilland.

JUAN

Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you

agree or disagree?

RICK

This is nuts. This is crazy...

Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.

31.

JUAN

Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill,

now married to tennis star John

McEnroe. Circle gets the square.

OTHER FREAKS

Yayyy!

WORM

Blast. O'Neill ... No talent

ragamuffin...

JUAN

okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's

it going to be?

JUAN (CONT'D)

Nosey the Nose Man!

JUAN (CONTD)

Cowboy!

JUAN (CONT-D)

The Bearded Lady!

BEARDED LADY

(gruff and masculine)

How ya' doin.

JUAN

Sockhead!

32.

JUAN

The Human Torch!

JUAN

Rosie the Pinhead!

JUAN

The hideous Frog Man!

JUAN

And of course, in the center

square, Mr. Paul Lynde!

JUAN

Well JulieErnie, who will it be?

ERNIE

Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go

with Paul Lynde.

JULIE

Don't be an idiot.

JUAN

You see, Rick? Just because we're

freaks doesn't mean we can't have

some fun, huh?

RICK

Get away from me. Get away! I'm

not like you. You hear me? I'm

Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!

33.

DISSOLVE TO:

ERNIE

Okay Coog, so I get twenty four

hour access to T `n' A, and you

look like a plate of rancid

giblets. We're still pals, right?

JULIE

All the freaks have gone through

this anguish, Rick. At first, I

was blinded by my anger. I admit

it. I wanted to break your neck

for getting me into this. But I

got over it. Juan taught me to

channel my anger for the common

good.

RICK

It was your fault, anyway. You

wanted to see the freak show.

JULIE

(FURIOUS)

I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!

RICK

Ernie!

ERNIE

Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second

there, I was a total man-hater.

Weird.

JULIE

Here. Take it.

34.

RICK

"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--

Now What?"

JULIE

we're in cubicle eight. Maybe

later you'll be ready to talk.

RICK

Forget it. Not me. I'm not like

those other god-forsaken animals.

WORM

You're mistaken, Rick. You are

exactly like us. We were all

normal healthy folk before we made

the fateful mistake of visiting

this hell hole at an off hour.

Why, when I first came here...

WAVY FLASHBACK

DISSOLVE TO:

WORM (V.O.)

I was a professor of lacrophylogy--

er, the study of worms, of course.

I came in search of the

Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman

terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.

Skuggs said he had just such a worm

in his shed. How could I have

surmised that the specimen and I

would ultimately prove to be one

and the same?

35.

WORM

At first, the transformation was

fabulous. I truly understood the

worm's ethos like never before.

But those early days of fascination

are over. Now, in retrospect, I

think the whole thing is a fucking

headache. I'd sell my soul just to

be able to wipe my own ass...

SOCKHEAD

I first came here as a tourist,

looking for some fun...

FLASHBACK

DISSOLVE TO:

SOCKHEAD (V.O.)

Anyway, then Elijah turned me into

a sock. That's it.

SOCKHEAD

Sorry. I'm not much for stories.

BEARDED LADY

When I arrived here, I was nothing

like I am now.

FLASHBACK

DISSOLVE TO:

36.

BEARDED LADY (V.O.)

I was confused--a walking

contradiction, so full of

questions.

BEARDED LADY/MAN

Now I know who I am. I can say,

"Hey world. This is me. I'm a

woman. And I like me."

FLASHBACK

DISSOLVE TO:

WORM

You are one of us now, Rick.

Whether you admit it or not. It's

irrefutable.

RICK

Yeah. Says you.

37.

TIME DISSOLVE

TO:

TIME DISSOLVE

TO:

RICK

(TO HAMMER)

You're right.

CUT TO:

JUAN

Hey. Mind your business.

ERNIE

Sorry.

38.

RICK

Well that EES guy should rescue me

any minute. Then it's straight to

the plastic surgeon and back to

sunny old L.A. I wonder how many

of my beautiful, anatomically

correct girlfriends will be waiting

for me.

STUEY GLUCK (V.O.)

I'll be waiting for you, Rick!

RICK

Thanks, Stuey.

RICK

AHH! A phantom troll!

COWBOY

(NEIGHBORLY)

Seeing phantom trolls, Rick?

RICK

(INNOCENTLY)

No.

COWBOY

Sounds to me like you've developed

a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer

nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey,

why he can smell the future. Lots

of us freaks got E.S.P. And

Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N.

SOCKHEAD

Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try

the skull cracker!

39.

COWBOY

Shucks, Rick, you're lucky.

Telepathy like yours only occurs

between real soulmates. A bond

like that should be cherished.

STUEY

Wow! I'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate!

RICK

In your dreams! Now get lost,

troll!

STUEY

(FADING AWAY)

Wait'll I tell the kids at school!

COWBOY

Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense

to spurn your soulmate. I reckon

that troll could help you if you

just let him into your heart.

CUT TO:

STUEY

Once America sees what happened to

Ricky, they'll probably send the

whole FBI down to save him!

CUT TO:

40.

STUEY

I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize

for this scoop. And I'll dedicate

it to Rick!

EDITOR (V.0.)

Of course I'll print it! America

needs to know! Burt! Give mister

Gluck his fee and show him out.

STUEY (V.0.)

That's okay. I know the way.

CUT TO:

STUEY

(READING ALOUD)

"Freaky Deaky! Ricky Coogan's a

mutant in South America! By Stuart

S. Gluck."

(to NEWSSTAND GUY)

That's me!

LAUGHING MAN

STUEY

Sure I wrote the article. But--

LAUGHING MAN

Ha-ha-ha!

STUEY

No. You've got it all wrong. I

don't know anything about that.

You gotta believe me.

LAUGHING MAN

Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa!

THE LIMO

CUT TO:

HUMAN TORCH

Wow, what a great model!

(he points at a toothpick)

But look, this one's crooked.

HUMAN TORCH

(STUPIDLY)

Sorry.

ELIJAH

Alright, freaks! Get ready for the

glamour! Get ready for the glitz!

Get ready to be pelted with rotten

vegetables, 'cause it's showtime!

CUT TO:

42.

ELIJAH

It's grisly! It's revolting! It'll

make you wish you were dead! And

at just twelve bucks a head, you

can bring all the kids!

CLOWN

C'mon, my granny could throw better

than you!

ELIJAH

(CALMLY)

Quiet, please.

43.

ELIJAH

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,

you are about to witness a

cavalcade of atrocities so

horrific, I advise the more

sensitive members of our audience

to leave the premises.

ELIJAH

Tonight I'm proud to announce the

addition of several new

monstrosities to the show,

including our star attraction, the

Beast Boy--an untamed and highly

dangerous ghoul who's liable to go

nuts and kill us all at the drop of

a hat.

(impressed "oohs", "ahhs",

and "cools" from the

AUDIENCE)

But first up, prepare to behold an

unspeakably repulsive yet

heartwarming atrocity, Three Men

and a Baby!

BACKSTAGE

RICK

Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will

eat you. Arrrghh.

(he throws down the

SCRIPT)

I can't do this shit!

44.

RICK

Damn it! What's keeping those

guys?

WORM

Something's troubling you, my boy.

what is it?

RICK

Well, let's see. I've been

kidnapped, hideously disfigured,

imprisoned with a bunch of mutant

freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A.,

and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude

Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago."

WORM

I think I know what you're going

through. I too had an eating

disorder. You see, I've always had

a feverish obsession with pudding.

And when I was a young lad...

ELIJAH

ELIJAH

And now a perennial favorite here

at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen.

I know you'll all enjoy the musical

stylings of Rosie the Pinhead.

ROSIE

(DROOLING)

EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE...

WEARS ON:

ERNIE/JULIE

45.

ERNIE

Hey Julie, how many feminists does

it take to screw in a light bulb?

JULIE

How many?

ERNIE

Two. One to screw it in and one to

ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!

JULIE

Oaf!

BEARDED LADY

If your coloring is in the autumn

range, like Maria's, try an earth

tone eye makeup. Now I've done a

lovely French braid on Maria, but I

encourage everyone to experiment

and use your imagination. The main

thing is to just have fun with it.

SOCKHEAD

SOCKHEAD

Edelweiss, Edelweiss.

MAN

He's got a hand under there!

SOMEONE ELSE

It's a hoax!

46.

ELIJAH

Puppetteering is an admirable skill

in its own right! Give him his

due!

THE CROWD

Where's the beast boy you promised

us!? Bring on the beast boy! We

want the beast boy! (etc.)

BACKSTAGE

WORM

And when I won first prize, they

never called me pudding-head again.

RICK

So?

WORM

Don't you see? You must turn your

hardship into inspiration! You're

an actor, Rick! Your body is your

instrument, and with it you must

play your tragic symphony for all

the world!

ELIJAH

(TO RICK)

They're going nuts for you, Beast

Boy! You better go out there now!

RICK

(determined, inspired)

I'll be right there.

(TO WORM)

Thank you Worm. I don't really

know how I can repay you for this.

WORM

(SINCERE)

You could wipe my ass.

RICK

(thinks Worm is joking)

Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm?

47.

WORM

(TO HIMSELF)

Damn.

(he turns to Nosey)

Nosey, have I ever told you what a

gifted artist you are?

ONSTAGE

RICK

Now is the winter of our

discontent,

Made glorious summer by this son of

York,

But I that am not shaped for

sportive tricks,

Nor made to court an amorous

looking glass,

I, that am curtailed of this fair

proportion,

Cheated of feature by dissembling

nature,

ALISTAIR COOKE

(SOTTO VOCE)

If you're having trouble

understanding Mr. Coogan's

brilliant reading of this soliloquy

from Richard the Third, please take

advantage of the handy subtitles

for the culturally illiterate.

48.

FILTHY PEASANT

SHHH!

RICK

Deformed, unfinished, sent before

my time,

{I'M UGLY}

Into this breathing world, scarse

half made up,

{I'M REALLY UGLY}

And that so lamely and

unfashionable, That dogs bark at me

as I halt by them.

{I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?}

Why I, in this weak piping time of

peace,

{BLAH, BLAH, BLAH}

Have no delight to pass away the

time,

{I NEVER GET LAID...}

Unless to see my shadow in the sun,

And descant on mine own deformity!

{BECAUSE I'M UGLY}

RICK

I'm saved! Haha! You sorry

mutants are gonna rot in this hole

while I'm sipping mint juleps by

the pool!

{AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO

DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}

49.

RICK

(TO KEVIN)

I mean, um, I hope you have room

for all my friends, heh-heh.

KEVIN

Rick, Rick, listen, I really love

this new look you've come up with.

But just between you and me, I

don't think the guys upstairs would

really get it.

RICK

What are you saying!?

KEVIN

(CHUCKLES SNIDELY)

I'm saying you're ugly enough to

burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.

ALISTAIR COOKE

AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!

RICK

EAT SHIT!

KEVIN'S HEAD

Now you're just being childish.

CROWD

AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF

HERE!

50.

ELIJAH

Now that's entertainment.

NOSEY

I'd like to buy a vowel.

RICK

Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?

JUAN

So. Now you don't mind mixing with

us--how did you say it--sorry

mutants?

RICK

Look! I'm sorry for what happened

at the show. Can't you just forget

it?

ERNIE

Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about

your big escape plan?

ERNIE

Well, excuse me for living.

RICK

You have an escape plan?

JUAN

Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a

simple diversion.

(MORE)

51.

JUAN(CONT'D)

Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks

cry out for freedom!

Aooooooorrraaaagh!

FREAKS

Aoo...

JULIE

Juan's plan is really ingenious

Rick. See, he figured out that--

JUAN

I figured out that our escape does

not include the Beast Boy. No one

may discuss the plan with him,

understand?

RICK

What's the matter with all of you?

You trust your lives to a guy just

'cause he can lick his own

privates?

ERNIE

You gotta admit, Coog, it's a

helluva trick.

RICK

(RESENTFUL)

Fine! I'll just come up with an

escape plan of my own then.

JUAN

Haha! I have spent a year studying

this hellhole, devising the perfect

escape. You think you'll just

tango right out the door!? Ha!

Just try it, amigo.

RICK

I will!

52.

JULIE

Rick, wait.

ERNIE

Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked.

Believe me, it ain't all it's

cracked up to be.

JULIE

This isn't one of your dumb movies,

Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a

smart dog. I'll talk to him.

Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't

do it without us.

RICK

Forget it! I don't need you, EES,

or anybody else! I'll get out of

here all by myself, you... you.,.

crud sucking pus monkeys!

ERNIE

I'm getting a bad feeling here.

CUT TO:

RICK

Damn.

RICK

(TO MILKMAN)

Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!

53.

OUTSIDE

MILKMAN

Yeah... ?

RICK (V.0.)

Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a

pal, and give me a hand will ya?

MILKMAN

Oooh no! I know you freaks.

You'll try anything just to get

someone to open that door. Well

not me! Ha!

RICK

Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk

the world's biggest breasted woman

all by myself. Sorry to bother

you.

RICK

(in a lusty womanish

VOICE)

Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now!

Milk me hard!

(Normal Rick voice)

I've only got two hands, all right?

Geez. I don't care if Elijah did

give you skim milk on the right

side, chocolate on the left, and

eggnog in the middle.

MILKMAN

(TO HIMSELF)

Gee, I love eggnog!

MILKMAN

Hey, what the--

54.

RICK

Shit.

RICK

Damn! This guy doesn't trust

anybody!

RICK

AHHHH!

ELIJAH

ELIJAH

Good work, Eye and Eye.

55.

THE EYES

ELIJAH (V.0.)

(over the walkie-talkie)

Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh,

den. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

ELIJAH

(TO RICK)

Diet soda?

RICK

No thanks.

ELIJAH

Fiddle Faddle?

(Rick shakes his head)

You sure?

RICK

Well, okay.

(he scoops some into his

MOUTH)

Well, are you gonna torture me or

kill me or something?

ELIJAH

Torture my greatest creation ever!?

Kill the final piece of the puzzle

that I've been putting together for

years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but

I've got a bigger plan, my boy.

(MORE)

56.

ELIJAH(CONT'D)

And when you ripped off that guy's

head, I knew it was working like

gangbusters!

RICK

But I thought I scared everyone

away.

ELIJAH

Uh-huh. And then they told two

friends, and they told two friends,

and so on, and so on. Look at

this.

ELIJAH

(READING)

Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked

and disgusted when my grandson told

me about the head-popping beast at

your show. Please send me six

tickets.

(he reads another)

Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New

Kids on The Block, but you're way

cuter. My favorite ice cream is

chocolate. Is it fun ripping

people's heads off? I love you.

(ANOTHER LETTER)

The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting

spree, and Oscar is along for the

ride!

(he looks up at Rick)

That one's from Pat Collins!

RICK

Yeah, but she loves everything.

ELIJAH

Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for

guests only! You've had enough!

RICK

Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in

show business all my life. The

public does not want to see

disgusting, depraved violent filth.

57.

ELIJAH

Oh, and I suppose Jake and the

Fatman is just a fluke?

ELIJAH (CONT'D)

I'll get it.

ELIJAH

`Yello?

ELIJAH

Yes... Right... Tomorrow...

Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay.

You got it... Hasta la vista to

you too. Hahaahahaahaha--

ELIJAH

Okay, Coogan. I'm finished with

you for now.

ELIJAH (CONT'D)

But listen. I may not be "Mr.

Tinseltown", but I damn well know

what I like. You're gonna be a

hideous killing machine, and that's

final! Tomorrow night I'll finish

the job onstage! And then, to

demonstrate your horrible power,

you'll slaughter all the old

obsolete freaks in cold bl--HEY!

TOAD

AAAGGGGHH!

58.

ELIJAH

I told you enough!

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

Bye-bye. And remember, try another

escape, and I'll feed your balls to

Toad.

BEARDED LADY

Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna

come up with your own escape plan?

RICK

(TO JUAN)

This is your big plan? A dozen

milkmen? Isn't that a little

unusual?

JUAN

Twelve milkmen is theoretically

possible. Thirteen is silly.

Looks like one milkman too many,

Coogan.

RICK

Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you

like reggae, ya flea bitten

bastard.

59.

RICK

Ah, shit.

RICK

Look, you'll all be killed. You

don't know about Elijah's giant

Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...

(they think he's nuts)

It's suicide! I can't let you do

it.

JUAN

And I can't let you stop us.

ELIJAH'S POV

ELIJAH

That's a lot of milkmen on the same

route. No wonder they fight.

A SQUIRREL

JUAN

Squirrel!

NOSEY

Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just

like Rick said.

SOCKHEAD

Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd

all be dead!

60.

OTHER FREAKS

Yeah! Way to go Rick! Alright!

ERNIE

(TO JULIE)

God, I can't believe he left you

for a squirrel. What a dick.

RICK

You know how men are. Besides, it

was a pretty good looking squirrel.

JULIE

(to the others)

Come on. You heard the Beast Boy.

Back to the Freak House, now.

ERNIE

Not again.

(TO RICK)

Oh well, at least we'll get to try

a new position.

CUT TO:

STUEY (O.S.)

AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW!

Notice the way I use an elliptical

motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks.

RICK

The Laughing Man!

RICK

(under his breath)

Holy shit!

ERNIE

It says it's strong enough for a

man!

JULIE

But it's made for a woman!

JULIE

Hey Rick. What's up?

RICK

Read this. I grabbed it from

Skuggs' office.

JULIE

"Tape Donahue... Renew

Subscription to Beaver World..."

Eeuw!

ERNIE

(interested, muffled)

Beaver World!?

RICK

(TO JULIE)

After that.

64.

JULIE

"Prepare demonstration for Laughing

Man, receive five thousand barrels

of Noxon." Five thousand barrels!?

RICK

Elijah's up to something big, and

we have to stop him.

RICK

Mmmm. Jasmine.

SWISH PAN TO:

RICK

Alright guys, listen up--

SOCKHEAD

We're done for! We're done for! I

don't want to die! It's the end of

the world! The apocalypse! Aahh!

RICK

I haven't said anything yet.

SOCKHEAD

Sorry. I'm not much for timing.

RICK

(TO EVERYONE)

Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll

be turned into a homicidal monster

and forced to kill you all. But we

might have a chance if we act fast.

And I'm prepared to be your new

leader.

65.

NOSEY

(TO SOCKHEAD)

I say we kill him.

RICK

And I've got a plan.

NOSEY

I still say we kill him.

RICK

If we can get into Elijah's lab,

maybe we can--

WORM

Of course! Design a super freak of

our own and manipulate the genetic

code to make him destroy Elijah

instead of us! Brilliant!

RICK

Oh. Well--

BEARDED LADY

But how do we get to the lab?

RICK

Um, maybe--

COWBOY

Right! The worm could dig a

tunnel!

WORM

By God, it's so crazy it might just

work!

ERNIE

But you need Noxon 24 to make the

freaking sludge, and Elijah told us

himself he's run out of it.

RICK

Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I

was going to say was--

66.

JULIE

Yes! Exactly! If they've been

using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer

here, the entire ecosystem must be

soaked with it! All we need is a

way to extract it from the

vegetation, ideally into a liquid

form.

RICK

Right. Well, what about--

COWBOY

Golly! So that's why my milk comes

out that funny green color! I

thought the grass tasted funny!

Wow, Rick, you're a genius!

JULIE

(SMILES WARMLY)

Good thinking, Rick.

NOSEY

Way to go, Rick! How did you ever

think of such a plan?

RICK

Well, actually, I was going to

suggest we send away for sea

monkeys, train them to fire guns,

and make a break for it. But if

you want to go with this other

thing, I guess that's okay.

CUT TO:

67.

ELIJAH

ELIJAH

WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN

RACKET!?

NOSEY

SOR-RY.

(to the freaks)

What a jerk!

RICK

Hey, look at this!

WORM

Good Lord! It's the Lost City of

Nodd!

JULIE

Wow!

68.

RICK

It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take:

"It's the Blarney Stone!"]

ERNIE

It's my Aunt Gladys!

ERNIE

And that's me at my bar mitzvah!

RICK

C'mon Ernie, let's go.

ERNIE

Wait, you gotta see the ones from

sleep-away camp! They're

hilarious!

JULIE

Stooge!

NOSEY

Almost there.

(he sniffs the air)

But wait, I'm getting a whiff of

things to come!

69.

BEARDED LADY

What do you smell?

NOSEY

(GRIM)

Blood.

NOSEY

(CHEERFUL)

And hot buttered popcorn!

BEARDED LADY

Awwright!

JULIE

I hate when you do that.

ERNIE

Hey! Do you hear that?

JULIE

It's a dog!

RICK

(TO WORM)

Hurry!

RICK

Scrappy!

RICK

It's been ten years since you

chased this ball into the sewer! I

thought you were gone for good!

SCRAPPY

Yap!

70.

RICK

Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help.

Understand?

SCRAPPY

Yap!

RICK

Good boy! Now go!

RICK

You never know.

JULIE

Look, a wood floor.

WORM

It must be the lab! we've done it!

ELIJAH'S VOICE

Not so fast, you scabrous freaks!

NOSEY

Didn't know I did impressions, did

ya?

NOSEY

Mission accomplished. They've got

the Noxon, and they'll be in the

lab within minutes.

FROGMAN

Boy, this is going like clockwork!

SOCKHEAD

No! Can't you see we're digging

our own graves!?

(MORE)

71.

It's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd)

that's what it is!

Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a

deathwish, but you can count me

out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF

HERE!

SOCKHEAD

(at the Eyes)

OUT OF MY WAY!

SOCKHEAD

(WEAK)

I... I... just... wanna...say...

NOSEY

What is it, kid?

SOCKHEAD

Ah, forget it. I'm not much for

dying.

CUT TO:

ERNIE

Shit. I can't see a damn thing.

RICK

Keep your voice down, Ernie.

ERNIE

Don't push me, Coog. I got a real

short fuse today. I'm cranky,

bloated, got a wicked case of

cramps. Don't ask why.

72.

JULIE

(whispers to Rick)

PMS...

RICK

(has to think about this)

Oh.... Right.

RICK

(CONT'D)

Well, here it is--the control panel

for Elijah's Freaking process.

WORM

Good work, my boy. Now step aside.

This is scientist's work.

ERNIE

Hey! It's working!

RICK

You did it, Worm! Way to go!

JULIE

But how? You didn't even use the

Noxon.

WORM

Ah! You don't need Noxon to make

Butterscotch pudding. I just

wanted to test the machine's

capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So

creamy! Yum!

73.

JULIE

Hang on, Rick. Do you really think

we should put this toxic glop on

you? What if it doesn't work?

What if something goes wrong? What

IF--

ERNIE

If it does work, do you think

there'll be enough left over to

give me a monster size rodney?

RICK

(TO ERNIE)

Here, hold this.

RICK

(TO ERNIE)

Thanks.

(to Julie, heroically)

Look, I've been a freak all my

life.' I realize that now. Up

there on that screen, humiliating

myself for every fool with six

bucks in his pocket--

ERNIE

Seven bucks.

JULIE

Sometimes seven fifty.

RICK

Alright. It doesn't matter.

ERNIE

Sure it does. They don't let you

into the theater if you don't pay

the price of the ticket.

RICK

Look, I'm talking about the

ultimate human sacrifice.

JULIE

No kidding. When you consider

money for parking, popcorn,

drinks...

74.

WORM

Don't forget a sitter for the

children!

RICK

Hey! In case you haven't noticed,

I'm about to commit a noble and

selfless act here.

RICK

Oops.

(BEAT)

Okay. Let's do what we came to do,

and this time, no more screw ups.

75.

ELIJAH

Styrofoam cup?

WORM

Don't you think we should make some

more pudding first, as a test?

RICK

No. Here goes.

ERNIE

Somebody's comin'! Hurry.

RICK

We have to wait. There's no way to

speed up the machine.

JULIE

Here it comes.

76.

RICK

It's plugged up!

ERNIE

(TO WORM)

If it's your damn pudding, I'll

ring your wormy neck.

WORM

(under his breath)

Preposterous... I have no neck.

I'm a worm, imbecile.

ELIJAH

Aaargh! Damn buttered popcorn!

OUTSIDE

WORM

The tunnel walls are about to

collapse!

RICK

You go ahead. I'll catch up.

JULIE

BUT--

RICK

Go!

JULIE

Rick! Come on!

ELIJAH

Bad for the environment.

Paul saved our lives!

Way to go, Paul!

RICK

This is no time to lament over a

cadaver! We've got to get moving,

or we're history! Now c'mon!

NOSEY

Daed si luap.

RICK

I said enough! Okay, listen up,

everybody. We cracked the code and

made the ointment we need to bring

Skuggs down for good.

79.

RICK

But we left it in the lab.

RICK

But wait! I found some macaroons!

And there's plenty for all of us!

FREAKS

Yaayyy!

TIME DISSOLVE

TO:

RICK

(under his breath)

I don't believe it. What's Hertz

doin' here?

RICK

So EES is in bed with Elijah C.

Skuggs, eh? Figures.

HERTZ

Rick! Thank God I got to you in

time!

80.

RICK

Cut the crap, Hertz.

HERTZ

Ricky, you have no idea how your

misfortune has touched our hearts.

When you disappeared we almost gave

up hope. But we'd heard reports of

Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon,

and when the story broke in the

tabloids, I decided to personally

come down and get to the bottom of

things.

RICK

(SKEPTICAL)

Really?

HERTZ

No.

(BEAT)

AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE

HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!

TORCH

Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That

really pisses me off!

RICK

AAARRGGGGHH!

81.

RICK'S POV

RICK

Holy shit.

ELIJAH

Nice to see you in the flesh,

Laughing Man.

HERTZ

No need to use codenames, Elijah.

We're all friends here. And just

to prove it, I brought you a little

present.

STUEY

Rick? Is that you?

ELIJAH

Who's the troll?

HERTZ

He was asking questions about

Coogan, causing trouble. We

figured he was one of yours.

ELIJAH

I make freaks alright, but come on,

fellas--this thing's pathetic.

82.

STUEY

Well you're no Julio Iglesias

yourself, mister.

(CALLS OUT)

Rick! Riiiick! Riii--

STUEY(V.0.)

RICK

Oh no, not now, Stuey!

RICK

(TO HIMSELF)

Hey. That's Elijah's lab!

(TO STUEY)

Stuey! Are you really in the lab?

STUEY

Yes! I'm in the lab! I'm in the

lab!

ELIJAH

Not only ugly, he's crazy too.

HERTZ

So, where were we?

ELIJAH

Gentlemen, I'm not going to

bullshit you. I know my setup here

at Freakland looks like small

potatoes.

83.

ELIJAH

But thanks to your Noxon and my

genius, tonight I will turn Ricky

Coogan into a freak so hideous,

it'll be enough to turn your

stomach inside out, boil your brain

in its own juice, and cause cold

sores you thought had healed up to

start buggin' you again.

(the EES men shift

UNCOMFORTABLY)

It's the dawning of a new age for

us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak

World!

ELIJAH (CONT'D)

It's really somethin', huh?

HERTZ

(FEIGNS APPROVAL)

Very impressive.

ELIJAH

We'll kick Disney's dead ass!

RICK

Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?

STUEY

Mmm hmmm!

RICK

I want you to try and escape. Get

the cup from underneath the

instrument table and bring it to

me, okay?

STUEY

(NODS)

Mmmm mmmmm!

84.

RICK

Yeah, right. Get movin'.

HERTZ

At EES, our plans for your Gene

Machine include everything, except

shoes that is. Ha-ha-ha.

ELIJAH

Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your

plans.

HERTZ

We'd love to show you.

(to his assistant)

Bill, if you'd be so kind.

BILL

What does today's businessman want?

How about a receptionist with six

arms, five mouths, and a knockout

figure? That'd sure speed things

up, wouldn't it?

85.

BILL

In the factory, how 'bout a worker

with twelve busy hands, no mouth to

talk back, and no genitalia or

digestive system to distract him

from his work?

(HE CHUCKLES)

Sure! It's what we all dream of!

BILL (CONT'D)

Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon

technology, it's not only possible,

it's just the beginning! Of

course, what happened to our

expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan

was an unfortunate coincidence, but

profits from these new markets

could total in the billions.

HERTZ

Ricky who?

ELIJAH

Hey! Hold on!

ELIJAH

Secretaries? Worker drones?

Where's the fun? Where's the

spark? Where's the unspeakable

evil?

BILL

Ha-ha. I was just getting to that.

86.

BILL

We'll impact every field.

COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT

creams, nosejobs in a bottle.

Military--human death machines that

make Schwarzenegger look like a

pansy! And why stop at consumer

products? Hell, we can design a

whole new consumer! A few well

placed drops in the water supply,

and bingo! It's a new master race,

and we own the copyright! An

entire planet of freaks owned and

operated by us! Every part of

their bodies comes from an EES

supplier, every thought they think

is EES policy! From now on

gentlemen, it's EES uber alles!

EES uber alles!

ELIJAH

This guy's good.

HERTZ

We lured him away from A.T.&T.

SECURITY GUY

Look! The troll!

HERTZ

After him!

STUEY

Mmm! Mmmmm!

87.

RICK

Take the tape off your mouth,

idiot! They didn't tie your hands!

STUEY

I got the cup, Rick!

RICK

Great! There's no time to waste.

Are you being followed?

STUEY

Yeah. But if I don't move, they

won't see me.

STUEY

Riiiick!

RICK

What a geek.

RICK

Stuey got caught. There's no way

to get the ointment before the

show.

WORM

So, that's it then? We're all to

die... And by your hand no less.

RICK

No. It won't be me. It's some

inhuman monster Elijah used me to

create. As for me, the real me,

I'll always be your friend. Before

I have to rip your heads off, I'd

like to say goodbye to each of you.

(He turns to Worm.)

Worm... I'll miss your brains, the

smell of your pipe, and the funny

way you always go on talking until

everyone wants to strangle you.

88.

COWBOY

Hi, Rick.

RICK

Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor,

your down-home wisdom, and of

course, the frothy milkshakes were

udderly delicious, heh-heh...

RICK

Bearded... Lady... I dunno.

We'll always have Paris...

RICK

Nosey, I never really liked you.

RICK

Frog Man, I think death is probably

the best thing for you now.

RICK

Ernie... Julie... I have mixed

feelings.

(He turns to Ernie)

On one hand, I'll remember you as

the best friend a jerk like me ever

had, and a low down repulsive

slimeball.

RICK (CONT'D)

On the other hand, I really respect

you, and more than that, I, uh,

well, I wish we'd had the chance to

boink.

JULIE

Oh, Rick...

RICK

Today I make the proudest boast a

man can utter: "Ich bien ein

Freak!"

89.

RICK

Uh, I'm a freak.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

And now the moment you've all been

waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen,

meet the lucky young man who's

about to be become the monster with

the mostest! Here he is, the Beast

Boy!

MILK MAN

AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!

STUEY (V.0.)

Rick! Over here!

90.

ELIJAH

With this remarkable ointment of my

own design, I will now turn this

half-finished ghoul into the

ultimate super freak, dedicated to

evil!

RICK (V.0.)

Stuey! Where are you?!

STUEY (V.0.)

Here I am, Rick!

BIKER

(TO STUEY)

Goddammit, kid! Would you sit

down!?

STUEY

AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

RICK

Oh no!

BIKER

What the hell!?

STUEY MONSTER

YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!

ELIJAH

Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE

AND EYE! KILL HIM!

91.

EYE AND EYE

RASTAFARI!

ELIJAH

TOAD!

ELIJAH

ELIJAH

Looks like it's time to roll out

the big gun.

(TO RICK)

Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?

RICK

Nahh.

92.

ELIJAH

Suit yourself.

RICK

Wait! Wait!

(Elijah pauses. Rick

RECONSIDERS)

Nahh.

RICK

AHHHHRRRGGG!

HERTZ

HERTZ

What a waste of twelve bucks.

Let's get the machine and go.

RICK

RICK MONSTER

TIME TO DIE, TROLL!

STUEY MONSTER

Rick! Rick! Could you sign

this!?

93.

THE CROWD

FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

ELIJAH

Give him the skull cracker, ya big

goon!

ERNIE

No way! The skull cracker is an

illegal move!

ELIJAH

Let's get this over with. Hey

Hertz, tell your goons to

(he turns to Hertz and is

STUNNED)

What the hell-!?

HERTZ

ASSISTANT

(TO ELIJAH)

Ahem. At this point in time we at

EES regret that we must leave this

performance prematurely.

ELIJAH

What are you saying!?

HERTZ

What we're saying is... get

stuffed, yokel.

ELIJAH

I figured I couldn't trust you

corporate greaseballs!

94.

ELIJAH

Let me proudly introduce the latest

in our product line, Noxon 25--now

available in a convenient pump!

HERTZ

Bullshit! The Everything Except

Shoes corporation releases no new

products unless I give the order!

ELIJAH

I think it's time EES branched out

a little.

ALISTAIR COOKE

Ahhh! Head for the hills before he

gets all of us!

RICK MONSTER

RICK MONSTER

NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!

JIMIE

No! We're your friends!

RICK MONSTER

Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!

95.

IMPRESSION:

ELIJAH

Now that's a really, really big

shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think

I'd like a pair of those!

ELIJAH

(to Rick monster)

Would you hurry up and waste the

troll, please!? I got a lonely

shoe over here!

CUT TO:

RICK

And then...

KATHIE LEE

Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've

been talking for almost ninety

minutes, and we've just got to go

to a commercial.

RICK

Sorry.

REGIS

We'll be right back after this,

folks.

CUT TO:

96.

PRODUCT SHOT

TOUGH VOICED ANNCR

You like cheese. You like being a

man. That's why you like..

TOUGH VOICED ANNCR

Macheesemo. Real cheese for real

men. Now in a handy aluminum

dispenser.

CUT TO:

KATHIE LEE

And now back to the exciting

conclusion of Ricky Coogan's

incredible story.

RICK

Well, let's see, the other freaks

were lined up in Elijah's sights,

and I was about to shove a pipe

through Stuey's skull, when all of

a sudden, I heard a voice...

DISSOLVE TO:

ELIJAH

Kill him! Kill him!

97.

COWBOY (V.O.)

I reckon that troll could help you

if you just let him into your

heart... your heart... your

heart...

COWBOY

Your heart... your heart... your

heart...

ERNIE

Atta' boy Coog!

(NUDGES WORM)

Hey, ain't that somethin'?

WORM

Tosh. (Sniff) Sentimental claptrap

(Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!

ELIJAH

Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and

start mutilating each other!

RICK

Raarrrrrrgh!

98.

ELIJAH

You think I made you strong? HA!

I've cranked my DNA up so high, you

won't know what hit you. I'm a

wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!

ELIJAH

(WEAKLY)

Ow! I think you crushed my spinal

cord. I can't feel anything in my

fingers.

RICK

Maybe you'll feel this ...

ELIJAH

Qait--if you kill me, you'll never

find the antidote.

RICK

What antidote?

ELIJAH

A time release serum--I baked it

into a delicious batch of

macaroons.

RICK

If you ask me, you skimped on the

coconut!

99.

ELIJAH

Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You

haven't got the guts to kill me!

Go on! I dare ya'!

SCRAPPY

Yap! Yap!

RICK

Scrappy!

ELIJAH

AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!

SCRAPPY

Yap!

RICK

Atta boy, Scrap!

FBI CHIEF

Freeze, FBI!

ANOTHER FBI GUY

Looks like they took care of

Skuggs, chief.

CHIEF

Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a

medal from the Vice President for

this.

RICK

Great. But how did you--

100.

CHIEF

We've been following Skuggs for

years. Scrappy just filled in some

of the details.

SCRAPPY

Yap!

FBI CHIEF

Thank heavens you brought him to

justice, Rick. God only knows how

far his sick plans would've gone.

ANOTHER FBI GUY

Hey chief, look at this!

FBI CHIEF

Is nothing sacred?

FBI CHIEF

Oh, my Lord!

RICK

No! It can't be!

ELIJUS

Thought you killed me, huh?

ELLY LEE

What the hell are you looking at?

FBI CHIEF

Two pieces of deadmeat!

101.

CUT TO:

RICKY

And that's my story.

KATHIE LEE

(YAWN)

It was so exciting!

REGIS

And long! My God! It makes War

and Peace sound like a warm up act!

CREW GUY(O.S.)

Okay! We got light!

REGIS

It's fixed? Well, it's about time!

RICKY

That's better.

REGIS

I'll say.

(TO AUDIENCE)

How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it

for Ricky Coogan!

KATHIE LEE

Can we bring out the other freaks

now?

102.

WORM

Ridiculous... Just because a man

doesn't like macaroons...

Nonsense.

JUAN

Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!

ALL THE EX-FREAKS

(happy to see him)

JUAN!

JUAN

Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!

REGIS

That's just great. What a story.

And what an ending! Elijah

transformed by the goop!

KATHIE LEE

And he really looked like--?

RICK

Exactly like you two, I swear.

Same faces, same outfits, except

they had these really big, hideous

feet...

ELIJUS

Show's over, Ricky!

ELLY LEE

I'm gonna drink your blood!

JULIE

Rick! It's finally over!

103.

RICK

Yes... Yes it is.

STUEY(O.C.)

Rick! Rick!

RICK

Stuey!

STUEY

Look! I found the real Regis and

Kathie Lee!

STUEY (CONT'D)

No, this is just my lunch!

STUEY

(matter of fact)

This is Regis and Kathie Lee.

AUDIENCE

Awwww!

ERNIE

Oh, like that wasn't totally

predictable.

JULIE

Well, now it really is over.

RICK

Thank God. You know, this

adventure has taught me something.

(MORE)

104.

RICK(CONT'D)

When man starts impinging on the

subtle perfection of the earth's

natural order, the only thing he'll

create is havoc.

ERNIE

Right, Coog. I learned somethin'

too. That men and women truly are

equals. That the human spirit

transcends gender and physical

appearance, and thus it is immune

to the petty degradations men may

devise. I believe it was Moliere

WHO SAID--

JULIE

Oh, shut up.

(She turns to Rick)

Let's go fuck.

RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER

Good night, everybody!

ROLL CREDITS

THE END?!
