"MAJOR LEAGUE"

Screenplay by

David S. Ward

SHOOTING DRAFT

THELMA

Spring training starts the twelfth.

How do you think the Indians will do

this year?

VIC

They don't look too good.

BUSINESS EXECUTIVE

They don't look particularly good,

do they?

LONGSHOREMEN

I'll tell ya. They don't look very

fuckin' good.

GROUNDSKEEPER

(in subtitles)

They're shitty.

DONOVAN

(checking his watch)

Thirty minutes late. Think she'll

show?

MATTHEWS

She's got to. She's the damn owner

now.

DONOVAN

She didn't last week. She was having

a guava facial.

RACHEL

Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to

another season of Indians' baseball.

RACHEL

I know that it may not seem the same

without Donald here this year, but I

promise you by the end of the season

this team will have made history.

RACHEL

(picking up a newspaper)

Unfortunately there are some in the

press who feel that...

(reading from the

page)

"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps

has no business being the owner of a

major league baseball team."

RACHEL

Obviously, Donald didn't feel that

way or he wouldn't have left the

team to me. And I was more than

showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I

know some of you have doubts about

my ability to run this franchise.

God help you if I ever find out about

it.

RACHEL

Spring training begins in two weeks.

(throwing a sheet of

paper on the table)

Here's the list of people we'll be

inviting to camp this year.

RACHEL

I could sit here and tell you what a

great year we're gonna have, but the

facts are we lost the two best players

we had to free agency. We haven't

won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't

even finished in the first division

for 15. Obviously it's time to make

some changes. What do ya think?

SIMMONS

I never heard of half these guys.

And the ones I do know are way past

their prime.

DONOVAN

Most of these guys never had a prime.

BUTLER

(pointing to the sheet)

This guy here is dead.

RACHEL

Cross him off then.

BUTLER

(under his breath)

Let's not be hasty.

RACHEL

It's time to shake things up, Charlie.

Clear the board and start over.

DONOVAN

Well, it's not the best material

I've ever had to work with, but I'll

do my best to see we move up a notch

this year.

RACHEL

I know you will, Charlie. That's why

I'm movin' you up to General Manager.

Congratulations.

RACHEL

Well, that should do it for today.

Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to

work.

MATTHEWS

(checking his watch)

One minute, 58 seconds.

BODY-BUILDER ASSISTANT

Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps would like

to see you.

RACHEL

Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat.

DONOVAN

I'm glad you called me in. I'm still

unclear on a couple things

RACHEL

Oh, really? Like what?

DONOVAN

Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna

be the Manager?

RACHEL

I was thinking of Lou Brown.

DONOVAN

Lou Brown?

RACHEL

He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of

the International League for the

last 30 years.

RACHEL

I think he'll fit right in with our

team concept.

DONOVAN

What exactly is our team concept?

RACHEL

That's what I wanted to talk to you

about. I want to put together a team

that will help us relocate to Miami.

DONOVAN

What do you mean?

(referring to the

roster)

Some of these guys are furniture

movers?

RACHEL

I'm serious about this, Charlie.

It's no secret I've never liked

Cleveland much. The weather's lousy,

downtown is a pit, the stadium's

falling apart, and we can't draw

dick. Another couple of years of

this and I'm gonna have to start

feeding Cha-Cha dog food.

DONOVAN

Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and

move a team on a whim...

RACHEL

It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered

to build us a new stadium -- 62,000

capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no

rent for the first million at the

gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media

guarantee; 45 percent of the

concession gross, all of the parking

and they pick up the stadium

operations costs. No other franchise

in baseball can match that deal.

DONOVAN

Even so, the League'll never let us

leave Cleveland. We got a lease with

the city.

RACHEL

The lease says we have the right to

move if our attendance falls below

800,000 for the year.

(pushing across a

copy of the lease)

Paragraph 40, line 17.

RACHEL

If we play bad enough, we should be

able to come in under that.

DONOVAN

What are you saying? You want us to

lose?

RACHEL

No, we've been losing. What I want

us to do is finish dead last.

DONOVAN

Mister Phelps would never have

approved of this.

RACHEL

He knew it had to be done. He just

didn't have the courage to do it.

(with veiled menace)

Hopefully, you will come to see the

wisdom of it.

(pause)

If this team lives up to its

potential, we could have the worst

record in all baseball.

TAYLOR

Yeh.

DONOVAN

Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan,

new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.

TAYLOR

(skeptical)

Yeh...

DONOVAN

I wanted to call and say the

organization remembers you fondly

from the years you played here and

we'd love to have you come to spring

training for a shot at this year's

club.

TAYLOR

Who is this?

DONOVAN

What?

TAYLOR

Is that you, Tolbert? This isn't

very funny, ya know. I'm hung over.

My knees are killin' me. If you were

gonna pull this shit, you could've

at least said you were from the

Yankees.

TAYLOR

(still to Donovan)

By the way, you were with me last

night. Who's this girl on top of me?

TAYLOR

Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.

TAYLOR

Tolbert.

TOLBERT

Who the hell were you talkin' to?

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

Lines three and four are waiting for

you, Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR-

70's.

BROWN

(picking up the phone)

Tire World.

DONOVAN

Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the

new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.

Listen, Lou, I hope you're sittin'

down 'cause I got an offer you

probably been dreamin' about your

whole life. We been watchin' your

progress down there at Toledo with a

lotta interest and well...

(a dramatic pause)

How would you like to manage the

Indians this year?

BROWN

I don't know...

DONOVAN

(incredulous)

What do ya mean you don't know? This

is a chance to manage in the big

leagues.

BROWN

Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie.

I got a guy on the other line about

some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya

later.

DONOVAN

Rick, we heard about your pitching

out at Portland last year...

VAUGHN

I'm, ah, not with them anymore...

DONOVAN

We'd still like to take a look at ya

at our spring camp in Arizona, March

first.

VAUGHN

Yeh, well, I'm not sure I can make

it by then.

DONOVAN

Don't worry, we're gettin' you out

on a sort of work furlough deal. Any

questions?

VAUGHN

Yeh. Where's Cleveland?

DONOVAN

Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty

years. Don't you wanna advance some?

BROWN

(eating a sack lunch)

I used to coach the unwed mothers'

softball team. I have advanced some.

DONOVAN

Well, what are you really worried

about? The money?

BROWN

Naw, I'm just not sure I'd be happy

in a big organization like that.

Owners are always on your back, tryin'

to "help you out."

DONOVAN

I don't think that's gonna be a

problem.

BROWN

Down here baseball's a game, not a

business. I don't wanta be a

babysitter for a buncha millionaires

who think they know it all already.

DONOVAN

We don't have any millionaires.

BROWN

Well then, bonus babies or whatever

you got...

DONOVAN

Don't have any bonus babies either.

BROWN

Don't you have any proven major league

talent?

DONOVAN

(embarrassed)

Not that I know of.

BROWN

Well, then... I'll be up in a couple

days.

DONOVAN

What?

BROWN

Sounds like my kinda team. Have my

contracts ready.

DONOVAN

(to the others)

Guess I really put the screws to

him.

MANAGER

Taylor, telephone for you.

TAYLOR

Hello.

DONOVAN

Jake, Charlie Donovan again.

TAYLOR

Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry

about this morning...

DONOVAN

No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts

on the first. Can you make it?

TAYLOR

Sure.

DONOVAN

You been stayin' in shape down there?

TAYLOR

Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.

DONOVAN

I thought so. See ya in Arizona.

CUT TO:

MANAGER

Let's go, Taylor. You're up.

TAYLOR

Luis, I'm not gonna be playin'

anymore. I got a tryout in the States.

MANAGER

Fine. Leave your uniform.

TAYLOR

But I changed at the motel.

MANAGER

Leave your uniform.

DONOVAN

This looks like Jake Taylor.

BROWN

He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't

he?

DONOVAN

Yeh.

PEPPER

Wish we had him two years ago.

DONOVAN

We did.

PEPPER

Four years ago then.

TAYLOR

What happened to the private rooms?

TEMPLE

We're on an austerity program. This

is what happens when you finish 24

games out.

BROWN

Who's that?

DONOVAN

I think it's Cerrano. Defected from

Cuba. Wanted religious freedom.

BROWN

What's his religion?

DONOVAN

Voodoo.

BROWN

Thought you didn't have any high-

priced talent.

DONOVAN

(sheepish)

I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's

only high-priced. Got him as a free

agent three years ago.

BROWN

Still hits the ball pretty well,

doesn't he?

DONOVAN

Yeh, he just can't field it.

BROWN

We'll shape him up.

DONOVAN

Don't recognize this guy.

HAYES

Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I

play like Mays and run like Hayes.

BROWN

Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.

HAYES

Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff...

DONOVAN

I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

PEPPER

Look at this fuckin' guy.

TEMPLE

Maybe he's the mascot.

DORN

Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks

like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey,

T.B., I love your pony tail. And the

earring's cute too. Where's the

matching bracelet?

TAYLOR

(offering his hand)

Jake Taylor.

TAYLOR

So, you just gonna settle for toilet

brush, or you got another name?

VAUGHN

Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.

TAYLOR

Forget about Dorn. He's always a

little tough on rookies. You'll get

a lot worse from other teams.

HAYES

Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays

Hayes here.

TAYLOR

Jake Taylor.

(pointing to Vaughn)

Rick Vaughn.

HAYES

What the hell league you been playin'

in?

VAUGHN

California Penal.

HAYES

Never heard of it. How'd you wind up

playin' there?

VAUGHN

I stole a car.

CUT TO:

GUARD

This guy wasn't invited to camp.

BROWN

Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen.

Most managers tell you at this time

that all the jobs are open, that

nobody's a lock at any position, and

that talent isn't everything. They'd

rather see desire and discipline in

a player. Then they tell you that

most of all they want you to have

fun out there, even though they're

gonna work your ass off on

fundamentals and condition you till

you drop. The difference between me

and those other managers is...

(pause)

I mean it.

CUT TO:

HAYES

Shit, I been cut already?

PEPPER

(checking stopwatch)

11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen

down.

BROWN

Get him a uniform.

HARRIS

C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.

HAYES

Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no

pain.

BROWN

How the knees holdin' up, Jake?

TAYLOR

Great. Never been better.

BROWN

Mobility's good? No problem gettin'

off the throw to second?

TAYLOR

No problem.

BROWN

I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who

can keep this team together on the

field. You were a helluva player

when you were sound, but around the

league they think you can't take the

pounding anymore.

TAYLOR

Around the league they're wrong.

BROWN

I'm gonna have to put you to the

test, ya know. So, I want the absolute

truth here. Are you 100 percent?

TAYLOR

Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin'

like that?

BROWN

(walking away)

You better if you wanna make this

team.

BROWN

C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All

Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.

BROWN

Well, you may run like Mays, but you

hit like shit.

HAYES

My stroke'll come back once I get

warmed up.

TEMPLE

(referring to some

stats)

Never did get warmed up last year.

Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up.

BROWN

I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise.

His speed could be a big asset.

PEPPER

(aside)

For what? Running back to the dugout?

BROWN

You gotta stop swingin' for the fences

though, Hayes. All you're gonna do

is give yourself a hernia. With your

speed you should be hittin' the ball

on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every

time I see you hit one in the air,

you owe me twenty pushups.

HAYES

Hey, no problem.

HAYES

Shit.

BROWN

Sometimes you can teach a guy to

hit. You can't teach him to run.

BROWN

All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're

a pitcher. Let's see what you got.

BROWN

Nice velocity.

PEPPER

Sounded like it.

TAYLOR

Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin'

that much octane.

BROWN

How much?

CLUBHOUSE MAN

96 miles an hour.

BROWN

(to Pepper)

Better teach him some control before

he kills somebody.

BROWN

C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the

damn ball.

(making like a

bullfighter)

Don't give me this ole' bullshit.

DORN

I took one of these in the eye last

year. Nearly lost my sight.

BROWN

I'm deeply moved. Every time you

play it off your hip, you give me

forty sit-ups.

DORN

What! That's Little League shit.

BROWN

So is this.

BROWN

Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come

nobody else picked up on him?

TEMPLE

(to the batting

practice pitcher)

Okay, Harris, that's enough fast

balls. Throw some curves.

BROWN

Oh.

DORN

Lou, I wanna have a word with you

here.

BROWN

Sure.

DORN

(whipping out his

contract)

Those penalty sit-ups you want me to

do? I got it right here in my contract

that I don't have to do any

calisthenics I don't feel are

necessary. What do ya think of that?

CUT TO:

PEPPER

(to Temple)

We got anybody left playin' baseball

out there?

TAYLOR

Shit, the way I played today, I

wouldn't be surprised if they red-

tagged me already.

HAYES

What do ya mean?

TAYLOR

Red tag in your locker means the

manager wants to see you, 'cause you

just died and went to the minors.

TAYLOR

Don't worry, they don't cut anybody

the first day.

VAUGHN

What is that stuff?

HARRIS

(pointing to them in

order)

Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of

'em will give you another 2-3 inches

drop on your curve ball.

HARRIS

Course if it's cold and I got a shirt

on under my jersey, I just rub a

little jalapeno inside my nose and

get it runnin'. I need to load up

the ball a little, I just wipe my

nose.

VAUGHN

(revolted)

You put snot on the ball?

HARRIS

At my age, you put anything you can

find on it. I haven't got an arm

like yours.

TAYLOR

What are you doin' there, Pedro?

CERRANO

Bats. They are sick.

TAYLOR

So are mine. Is somethin' goin'

around?

CERRANO

No hit curve ball. Straight ball,

hit it very much. Curve ball, bats

are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come.

Take fear from bats.

HAYES

Jo-Buu?

TAYLOR

Maybe he's the pagan saint of

baseball.

CERRANO

I offer him cigars and gin. He will

come.

HARRIS

I wouldn't leave this gin sittin'

around out here with this group.

CERRANO

(with a certain gravity)

Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin.

Is very bad.

VAUGHN

This is final cut down day, right?

TAYLOR

Yeh, better get your snake ready,

Hayes.

HAYES

No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My

hands are too screwed up to hold it

anyway.

TAYLOR

If you're gonna use that head first

slide, you better get yourself some

gloves or you're not gonna have any

skin left on your hands.

VAUGHN

I don't wanna go in there.

TAYLOR

Whatever happens, keep it to yourself

until you're outta the locker room.

Don't celebrate in front of guys who

just died.

HAYES

What if we're one of the deceased?

HAYES

C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts

here. If they cut us, we'll just

sign with the Yankees.

CUT TO:

VAUGHN

I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You

haven't heard the last of me. You

think I'm shit now, but someday you'll

be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch

on somewhere else, and every time I

pitch against you, I'm gonna stick

it up your ass.

BROWN

Good, I like that kinda spirit in a

player. The only problem is, I didn't

cut you.

VAUGHN

What do you mean?

BROWN

I think somebody's been havin' fun

with you.

DORN

(to Vaughn)

What's the matter, little lady? Can't

you take a joke?

BROWN

Can I have your attention, please? I

counted up your ballots for team

captain and I think you chose the

right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda

told you he won anyway. Mr. C for

the year -- Jake Taylor.

TAYLOR

Forget about Dorn. You got other

things to do.

VAUGHN

Like what?

TAYLOR

Packing for Cleveland.

CUT TO:

THELMA

You see the new lineup the Indians

got?

BOBBY

I never heard of most of 'em.

BUSINESS EXECUTIVE

I don't know the majority of these

names.

LONGSHOREMAN

Who are these fuckin' guys?

GROUNDSKEEPER

(in subtitles)

They're shitty.

TAYLOR

(to himself)

Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

HAYES

Really got all of that one.

VAUGHN

What was it? A slider?

TAYLOR

What are you gonna have?

HAYES

I don't know. What language is this?

TAYLOR

French.

HAYES

They got patty melts over there?

TAYLOR

Forget it. I'll order. Let's have a

toast.

TAYLOR

Here's to baseball, here's to the

start of two great careers, and for

me, here's to at least one more good

year in the sun.

VAUGHN

What is it? The chick?

TAYLOR

That's my wife.

HAYES

Does she know it?

TAYLOR

I mean she woulda been if I hadn't

screwed it up. Who's that guy she's

with?

HAYES

I don't know. He's not wearing a

name tag.

VAUGHN

You want me to beat the shit out of

him?

TAYLOR

No.

HAYES

What does she do?

TAYLOR

She's a librarian.

VAUGHN

A librarian? Shit, I gotta start

readin' again.

WAITER

Miss Wells, there's a telephone call

for you.

LYNN

Hello.

VOICE

Hello, Lynn. It's Jake.

LYNN

Jake? How did you know I was here?

TAYLOR

Just a hunch. I took you there when

you got your masters. I figure you're

probably wearing the black velvet

dress with the red sash.

LYNN

How did you know that? I didn't have

this dress when we were...

TAYLOR

You look great.

LYNN

Thanks. What are you doin' here?

Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico

somewhere?

TAYLOR

I'm playin' with the Indians again.

Back in the Bigs.

LYNN

That's great. I'm happy for you,

Jake.

LYNN

(starting away)

I gotta get back...

TAYLOR

Wait a minute. What's your number. I

tried calling you at home, but you're

not listed...

LYNN

My life is different from when you

knew me.

TAYLOR

Meaning what? That I don't know you

anymore?

LYNN

Couldn't we talk about this some

other time? I really gotta...

TAYLOR

Okay, just gimme your number.

LYNN

I don't think that's a good idea.

TAYLOR

Why not? Because of the guy you're

with? What is he, a banker?

LYNN

Lawyer. Please, Jake, he's watching

us.

TAYLOR

I'm not leavin' without your number.

You still wear those great little

tortoise-shell glasses? I always

loved it when you took them off.

LYNN

(exasperated)

Jake...

TAYLOR

The number, Lynn...

LYNN

(reluctant)

All right. 555-9314.

TAYLOR

Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm

gonna be around.

CABBIE

What's the number again?

TAYLOR

(looking at a piece

of paper)

1036.

HAYES

What is this place?

TAYLOR

Furnished apartment building owned

by the Indians. We get special rates.

With what we're makin' we'll need

it.

CABBIE

That's it.

TAYLOR

Welcome to the Big Leagues.

VOICE ON PHONE

Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.

TAYLOR

You got anybody workin' there named

Lynn Wells?

VOICE ON PHONE

Never heard of her.

TAYLOR

Didn't think so.

TAYLOR

Take it easy. We got 162 of these to

go.

BROWN

All right, let's gather 'round.

BROWN

I'm not much for inspirational

addresses. I just wanta point out

that every newspaper in the country

has picked us to finish last. The

local press thinks we'd save everybody

a lot of time and trouble if we just

went out and shot ourselves. Me, I

like to waste sportswriters' time so

I'm for hangin' around and seein' if

we can give all these guys a nice

big shitburger to eat.

HARRIS

Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I

mean we're not all savages like

Cerrano.

BROWN

You guys go ahead. I belong to the

church of three-run homers.

HARRIS

All right, let's bow our heads.

CERRANO

Have to wake up bats.

HARRIS

Dear Lord, we ask...

CUT TO:

JOHNNY

You read the Plain Dealer today?

They said this is gonna be the worst

Indian team we've had in years.

THELMA

Everybody laughs at the Indians now,

but there were other times. Even won

the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays

made that catch on Vic Wertz in the

'54 Series and Cleveland's never

been the same since.

JOHNNY

As the Indians go so goes Cleveland,

huh?

THELMA

If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland

would die.

DOYLE

(on the air)

Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here,

welcoming all you Friends of the

Feather to another season of Indians

baseball.

(pouring some Jack

Daniels in his Coke)

A lotta new faces for the tribe this

year, as they take on the defending

American League champs, the New York

Yankees. And listen to the roar of

the crowd as the Indians takes the

field!

DOYLE

Yes, sir, they love this club here

in Cleveland.

DOYLE (V.O.)

High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes

under it now... Oh, makes a basket

catch, Willie Mays style, and the

side is retired.

BROWN

All right, way to look, way to look.

Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin'

do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!

DOYLE

Bottom of the first, Willie Mays

Hayes to lead it off for the tribe.

DOYLE (V.O.)

A lotta people say you can tell how

a season's gonna go by the first

hitter of the year. In the last

fifteen years, the Indians have never

had the season lead-off hitter reach

base.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks

it down, gets up, fires to first.

Too late! Hayes beats it!

DOYLE

And so the string is broken. Maybe

things will turn around a little for

the Indians this year.

BLEACHER BAND

In the land of burning waters, waters

Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we

Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their

foes to dead men, Ummmmm.

FIRST BASEMAN

Showed some real power on that one,

Slugger.

HAYES

I plan to get at least a double out

of it.

DOYLE (V.O.)

And now Hayes is putting on a pair

of black gloves, sending a little

message to the Yankees.

HAYES

(to the First Baseman)

Bought a hundred of these, one for

each base I plan to steal. Excuse

me, here, I gotta take my first step

toward the Hall of Fame.

FIRST BASEMAN

You look real sharp, but you'll never

steal second with your shoe untied.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Brewster, quick move to first...

DOYLE (V.O.)

He got him. Hayes is picked off.

FIRST BASEMAN

Nice base running, dildo. Hard to

get your thumb out of your ass with

the gloves on.

DOYLE

Well, so much for that.

TAYLOR'S VOICE

Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get

the throw up. Don't bounce the damn

ball.

TAYLOR'S VOICE

Nice throw, dickhead.

DOYLE

Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation,

Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You

can close the book on Winters...

TAYLOR

Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four

down. We're still in this thing.

PEPPER

Don't worry if you're off the plate

on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to

put the fear of God in a hitter.

DOYLE (V.O.)

First pitch is a little high...

YANKEE HITTER

This guy kinda wild?

TAYLOR

I figure you got a 30% chance to

survive this at bat.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Ball four.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Ball eight.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases

loaded on twelve straight pitches.

By the laws of probability, you'd

think one of those coulda drifted

over the plate.

BOBBY

Wild thing, You make my heart sing,

You walk everything.

PEPPER

Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared

enough now. Time to get a few of 'em

out.

PEPPER

Just relax, and keep the arm up on

top. Gotta throw strikes. No place

at the inn for this guy.

HAYWOOD

Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up

here?

TAYLOR

Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.

VAUGHN

Oh, shit...

PEPPER

(to Brown)

Looked like a strike anyway. You

want me to go get him?

BROWN

No, let's see how he reacts.

BROWN

Interesting.

PEPPER

At least he hit what he was aimin'

at.

BROWN

I think you can go get him now.

PEPPER

C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets

up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.

DOYLE

So, a tough start for the Erie

warriors, as they drop a heartbreaker

to the Yankees, nine to nothing. The

Post Game Show was brought to you

by...

(searching for the

paper)

Christ. I can't find it. The hell

with it. This is Harry Doyle saying

good night, everybody, and Happy

Hunting.

RACHEL

(getting up to leave)

We're off to a good start, gentlemen.

Let's keep it up.

VAUGHN

God, I was horse shit tonight.

TAYLOR

Only thing you got to be sorry about

was hittin' Coleman.

VAUGHN

What?

TAYLOR

If you wanted to send a message, it

shoulda been to Haywood. He hit the

damn homer. Coleman was just picking

his nose in the on-deck circle.

TAYLOR

Forget the other stuff. It coulda

happened to anybody. Besides, Haywood

didn't hit it that good. That ball

wouldn't have been out of a lotta

parks.

VAUGHN

Oh yeh, name one.

TAYLOR

(after a pause)

Yellowstone.

VAUGHN

Shit...

LYNN

(hushed)

Jake, you shouldn't have come here.

TAYLOR

I was wonderin' why you'd give an

old friend a bum phone number.

LYNN

Let's talk in my office, okay?

TAYLOR

I don't wanna talk in your office.

LYNN

I told you I don't think it's a good

idea for us to see each other.

TAYLOR

Why not?

LYNN

We don't have anything in common.

Sometimes I wonder if we ever did.

TAYLOR

What are you talkin' about? We were

both athletes, world class, hot for

each other. What more can you have

in common?

LYNN

I stopped bein' an athlete three

years ago. Books are my life now.

LYNN

Don't you dare laugh, Jake. In two

years I've put together one of the

best special collections departments

in the country.

TAYLOR

So what is it? You're still sore I

never read Moby Dick?

LYNN

You never read anything I asked you

to.

TAYLOR

Not like what's-his-name at the

restaurant?

LYNN

His name is Tom, and keep your voice

down.

TAYLOR

What do ya see in this guy?

LYNN

He's stable. He's intelligent... and

I've never found him in bed with a

stewardess.

TAYLOR

That's 'cause no stewardess would

have him. Wouldn't you rather be

with somebody who's in demand?

LYNN

Just like always, you don't take

anything seriously. Everything's a

joke to you.

TAYLOR

C'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I'm

just tryin' to loosen things up a

little. I'm gettin' frostbite here.

LYNN

Tom and I are getting married in the

fall.

TAYLOR

What? That's crazy, Lynn. I got plans

for us.

LYNN

(walking again)

What plans?

TAYLOR

I was gonna play another a year or

two, then we go to Hawaii, and have

a couple kids who grow up to be

Olympic champions.

LYNN

(stopping again)

How can you think stuff like that? I

haven't seen you in two years. You

never even wrote me a letter.

TAYLOR

I'm sorry, Lynn, but I wasn't exactly

proud of my situation. C'mon, you

didn't think about me at all since I

been gone?

LYNN

(walking again)

Not so loud, Jake.

TAYLOR

Remember the three nights we spent

on the beach in Vera Cruz? You have

nights like that with Mr. Briefcase?

LYNN

(stopping again)

What about the night you had in

Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen?

TAYLOR

What was I supposed to do? She bet

me fifty bucks she had a better body

than you. I had to defend your honor.

LYNN

(whirling on him and

exploding)

What a bunch of bullshit!

(exasperated)

I have a much better body than she

does.

TAYLOR

(addressing the library

patrons)

She's right. Take it from me, she

really does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen

has quantity, I give her that, but

the, ah, quality just isn't there.

TAYLOR

How many think Lynn oughta give me

another shot?

TAYLOR

The ayes have it.

LYNN

(walking off again)

You haven't changed at all, have

you?

TAYLOR

I'm afraid I have or I wouldn't be

here. C'mon, Lynn, I don't wanna do

time for things that happened years

ago.

LYNN

(turning back to him)

I'm sorry, Jake. You'll always be

the little boy who wouldn't grow up.

TAYLOR

Lynn, wait...

RACHEL

A quarter of the season's gone, we're

15 and 24, seven games out of first.

Our attendance is just below 180,000.

That's bad, but not bad enough.

DONOVAN

Projected over the whole season, we

stand to wind up 36 games under .500

and 28 out of first. That should be

bad enough for anybody.

RACHEL

We finished 24 out last year and

still drew 890,000. When school's

out for the summer, attendance is

liable to rise. Plus, this team is

showing signs of improvement. I didn't

think we'd win 15 games all year.

Any ideas?

DONOVAN

On how we can get worse?

(sarcastic)

How about a series of fines for good

play? Maybe a $30,000 bonus to the

guy chosen Least Valuable Player.

RACHEL

This is no laughing matter, Donovan.

(pause)

I think maybe the problem is we're

coddling these guys too much.

CUT TO:

HAYES

What's with this? We never leave

from this terminal.

TAYLOR

Maybe the other one's jammed up.

HAYES

(pointing to the jets)

Which one is ours?

GATEMAN

That one.

CUT TO:

TAYLOR

What is this, Lou?

BROWN

Front office says it's an economy

measure, 'cause we're not drawin'

good.

TAYLOR

Well, they certainly have spared

every expense.

HARRIS

Oh, so now you come around.

(pointing up)

He's not fooled.

HAYES

Call the stewardess, Vaughn. I need

one of those bags.

VAUGHN

There aren't any stewardesses.

HAYES

I wonder if there's any pilots.

DOYLE

Two down, top of the ninth. Last

chance for the red and blue.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Bouncing ball to second. This should

be it. Collins up with it, on to

first, and the game is over.

DOYLE

So, the Sons of Geronimo, still

suffering a bit from propeller lag,

are nipped by the Tigers tonight, 7

to 0. The only excitement for the

tribe provided by Rick Vaughn who

set an American League record by

throwing four wild pitches in one

inning. Congratulations, Rick. For

the Tigers, 5 runs, 9 hits, and no

errors. For the Indians, one run,

and let's see, one hit.

(to his Stat Man)

Is that all we got, one fucking hit?

STAT MAN

(whispering)

You can't say "fuckin'" on the air.

DOYLE

Don't worry about it. Nobody's

listening anyway.

HARRIS

Who you got lined up tonight?

DORN

Where are we? Kansas City, right?

Gotta be Arlene

HARRIS

You call her?

DORN

Don't have to. She knows when I'm in

town.

TAYLOR

I'm about ready to turn in. I've

anesthetized my knees enough.

GUY

Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, can I have

your autograph?

VAUGHN

Ah... yeh... sure.

(signing)

My first autograph. I couldn't give

these away a couple weeks ago.

GUY

I saw your record on the news. You

made their Hall of Shame.

Congratulations.

VAUGHN

(embarrassed)

Thanks.

TAYLOR

You're a celebrity now, Vaughn.

VAUGHN

I thought you had to do somethin'

good to be a celebrity.

TAYLOR

Not if you do it colorfully.

DORN

(pointing to the door)

What'd I tell ya.

ARLENE

Hi, Rodger. This is Vicki and Rene.

DORN

Hi, doll. This is Steve Harris.

ARLENE

Where's your buddy Gant?

DORN

(indicating Vaughn)

They cut him to make room for bristle

boy over there.

ARLENE

(looking over at Vaughn)

Is that Vaughn, the guy they call

Wild Thing?

DORN

(in disgust)

Yeh.

ARLENE

He's kinda cute. They say he could

be a big star.

DORN

What are you talkin' about? He

couldn't find the plate if it was

magnetized. He won't last the year.

ARLENE

He struck out five in a row before

the wild pitches.

(taking her leave)

Maybe I'll check him out.

DORN

(grabbing her)

Wait a minute, you're with me.

ARLENE

I don't remember you makin' any date.

DORN

Since when do I have to make a date?

Who's been showin' you this town the

last three years?

ARLENE

Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta

look out for myself now. I don't

have to be a slave to no .235 hitter.

ARLENE

Wild Thing, you make my heart sing.

TAYLOR

Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn?

DORN

Speak for yourself, Taylor. I got a

couple good years left.

HAYES

"Moby Dick?" What is that?

TAYLOR

It's one of the masterpieces of

American literature, that's all.

HAYES

Lynn put you on to this?

TAYLOR

Long time ago.

HAYES

Well, we're goin' to a club tonight.

You wanna come along?

TAYLOR

No, I got some more reading to do.

HAYES

What, you got a test or somethin'?

Why don't you just go over and see

her? Maybe she'll let you slide on a

couple of these.

TAYLOR

I might if I knew where she lives.

HAYES

Easy. Tail her home from the library.

TAYLOR

You mean sit in a car and wait for

her to come out? That's kinda

juvenile, don't you think?

HAYES

(as if that had

anything to do with

it)

Yeh.

CUT TO:

TAYLOR

Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you

home but I wanna...

LYNN

(hurried)

This isn't my place...

TAYLOR

Whose place is it?

TOM

Who's there, love?

(spying Taylor)

Oh, Mr. Taylor, right?

(pointedly)

I remember you from the restaurant.

Lynn's told me a lot about you. Why

don't you come in for a while?

TAYLOR

Nah, that's o.k., I got some things

to do...

LYNN

Yeh, he's gotta be goin'...

TOM

No, really, come on in for a drink.

TOM

Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake

Taylor.

(making the intros)

Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway

Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a

professional baseball player.

TOM

So, Jake, what brings you here this

evening?

TAYLOR

I, ah, just had a couple books I

wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought

this was her place.

TOM

Well, it soon will be.

TAYLOR

Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged.

Congratulations.

TOM

Thank you. What can I get you to

drink?

TAYLOR

Beer'll be fine.

JACK

What team do you play for, Jake?

TAYLOR

The Indians.

CLAIRE

Here in Cleveland? I didn't know

they still had a team.

TAYLOR

Yeh, we have uniforms and everything.

It's really great.

TOM

(handing Jake his

beer)

They're last right now, but hopefully

moving up, eh, Jake?

JANICE

I'm told that baseball players make

very good salaries these days.

TAYLOR

That depends on how good they are, I

guess.

JANICE

How good are you?

TAYLOR

I make the League minimum.

LYNN

He was one of the best in baseball

until he had problems with his knees.

TOM

What are you going to do when your

career ends? I mean you can't play

baseball forever, can you?

TAYLOR

Somethin'll come up.

TOM

Will it?

TAYLOR

I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin'

to Hawaii, and having a couple of

kids who grow up to be Olympic

champions.

JACK

Oh really. In what event?

TAYLOR

Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter

Individual Medley. I figure it oughta

be big by then.

BRENT

You got the girl picked out?

TAYLOR

I did, but I wasn't smart enough to

hold on to her.

BRENT

You used to be an athlete, didn't

you, Lynn?

LYNN

(not wanting to pursue

it)

Yes.

BRENT

What did you do?

LYNN

(reluctant)

Two Hundred Individual medley.

TAYLOR

Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team.

TAYLOR

Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have

met you all.

TOM

Let me walk you out.

TAYLOR

Thanks for the beer.

TOM

Don't mention it.

TAYLOR

I'll let you know if I land a good

job. I know you're concerned about

it.

TOM

Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to

know what she would've had ahead of

her.

TOM

Stay away from her.

TAYLOR

(smiling)

Suck my dick.

PEPPER

Lou wants to see you down at the

office, Rick.

BROWN

C'mon in, Rick.

BROWN

Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the

bush here. You got a great arm, one

of the best I've ever seen, but your

control hasn't come around like we

hoped it would.

BROWN

Now, there are a lotta pitchers that

started out wild and, after workin'

it out in the minors, for a while,

went on to great careers.

(pointing to a picture

on the wall)

Take Sandy Koufax there...

VAUGHN

What about Koufax?

BROWN

Never mind Koufax.

BROWN

Read these letters, starting at the

top.

BROWN

Can't read it, can you?

VAUGHN

You gonna send me to the minors?

BROWN

Nope.

CUT TO:

VAUGHN

These things make me look ridiculous.

TAYLOR

Drop in the bucket, Vaughn.

VAUGHN

What's that for?

CERRANO

Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo-

Buu. I still can no hit curva ball

for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice

to him.

TAYLOR

Sacrifice? You mean like something

living?

CERRANO

Si. I kill unborn children.

HARRIS

Not while I'm here you're not. That's

murder.

BROWN

All right, let's hit the field.

HARRIS

Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.

CUT TO:

DOYLE (V.O.)

We're in the ninth, two down, man on

first and the Indians clinging to a

one run lead. VAUGHAN, one out away

from his first major league victory...

DOYLE (V.O.)

Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it,

into left field, base hit. Clarke

digging around second, he'll make it

to third, and the A's have runners

at the corners.

PEPPER

You want me to go get him?

BROWN

No, he's come this far. Let's see if

he can finish it.

DOYLE

Vaughn in a little trouble here, but

I'll tell ya, these Cleveland fans

are great. Listen to them get behind

Vaughn.

BOBBY

We need some defense here. Maybe we

oughta do a wave.

JOHNNY

C'mon, Indians don't do waves. Let's

keep this thing pure.

VIC

What harm could it do?

DOYLE (V.O.)

Runner goes, high, Taylor has no

play. The go-ahead and potential

winning run is in scoring position.

TAYLOR

Forget the runners, Ricky, get this

guy at the plate.

DOYLE

High ball two, and the crowd doesn't

like that call one bit.

TAYLOR

Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick.

You know he's lookin' for this pitch.

Gotta come up with somethin' studly.

VAUGHN

Fuckin' Dorn. Game shoulda been over

by now. Dorn coulda had that ball.

He tanked it on purpose.

TAYLOR

This isn't the California Penal

League, Vaughn. We're professionals

here. We don't tank a play for

personal reasons, so cut the crybaby

shit. You've pitched a helluva game.

You wanna finish it, don't ya?

TAYLOR

Can you give me a strike on this

pitch?

VAUGHN

Yeh, but I don't know if there'll be

much on it. My arm feels like jello.

TAYLOR

Just make sure it's over the plate.

I want him to swing.

VAUGHN

The last time I did that, the guy

hit one that hasn't landed yet.

TAYLOR

Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

TAYLOR

By the way, I been meaning to ask

you. Why'd you steal that car?

VAUGHN

I was bored.

TAYLOR

Next time you might think about takin'

in a movie or somethin'.

TAYLOR

Helluva situation we got goin' here,

huh, Rexman? Two on, two out, you're

down by a run in the ninth. You got

a chance to be a hero on national

television, so whatever you do, don't

blow it. They'll be callin' you a

gutless choke artist all over America.

TAYLOR

You're a free agent at the end of

the year. Not much demand for gutless

choke artists. What are you hittin'

now? .230? .240?

REXMAN

.316.

TAYLOR

Hey, nice average. Uh oh, on second

thought, that still means you got a

seven outta ten chance of goin' in

the dumper.

REXMAN

Shut up, will ya, Taylor?

TAYLOR

Hey, I can understand not wantin' to

talk about baseball when your nuts

are in a vice like this.

TAYLOR

By the way, I saw your wife at the

Capri Lounge last night. Hell of a

dancer. You must be very proud.

TAYLOR

But that guy she was with... I mean

I'm sure he's a close personal friend

of yours and all, but tell me...

TAYLOR

...Why was he wearing her panties on

his head?

TAYLOR

Uh oh, Rexie, I don't think that

one's got the distance. Maybe if the

wind comes up.

BROWN

It's startin' to come together,

Pepper. It's startin' to come

together.

SUZANNE

Oh hi, Jake, how are you?

TAYLOR

Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick

word with Rodger?

SUZANNE

Sure, c'mon in, he's in the den.

I'll get some coffee.

DORN

Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you

out here?

TAYLOR

I just wanta tell ya somethin', but

I didn't want to do it in front of

the whole team.

DORN

Sure, go ahead.

TAYLOR

(like nails)

I don't know what your problem is,

but...

(bending close to

Dorn)

...if I ever see you tank another

play like you did tonight, I'll cut

off your nuts and stuff 'em down

your fuckin' throat.

SUZANNE

Coffee anybody?

HAYES

Why the hell are we havin' practice

during the All-Star break?

TAYLOR

I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered

it.

VAUGHN

It's hotter than shit in here. What

happened to the air conditioning?

BROWN

(to Dorn)

Oh man, this old body can use a soak.

DORN

Forget it. It's not workin' again.

BROWN

Damn it, I thought they were gonna

replace this thing.

HARRIS

Hey, there's no hot water in here.

BROWN

She's at it again. I've had it with

this nickel and dime stuff.

(storming out of the

training room)

I'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone.

RACHEL

You wanted to see the Bitch?

BROWN

Yeh.

RACHEL

Don't you think you oughta cover

yourself with a towel first, Mr.

Brown?

BROWN

There aren't any towels, and I'm too

old to be diving under benches.

RACHEL

Well, I can take it if you can.

BROWN

What happened to the new whirlpool

we were supposed to get?

RACHEL

Revenue problems have forced us to

cut back on equipment. We'll simply

have to fix the old one.

BROWN

You fixed it six times already. And

now there's no hot water in the

showers.

RACHEL

The pipes in this building are old

and rusted. We're replacing them,

but it's a long, expensive process.

BROWN

How am I supposed to keep my players

healthy with cold water and no therapy

equipment?

RACHEL

Your players will just have to get a

little tougher. What are they, a

bunch of pansies?

BROWN

Over 162 games even tough guys get

sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...

RACHEL

It's only temporary. Besides, these

guys weren't playing that good when

the equipment was workin'. If I could

get anybody to come and watch this

team, none of this would be necessary.

You oughta be grateful I can still

pay your salaries.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FARMER

In case you haven't noticed, and

judging by attendance, you haven't,

the Indians, that thought-to-be

hopeless collection of has-been's

and never-will-be's is actually

approaching the .500 mark, and with

it, semi-respectability. Nothing to

write home about, to be sure, but at

least we don't have to cover our

eyes.

VIC

Ya know, they could be a lot worse.

BUSINESS EXECUTIVE

Ya know, I may have underestimated

this team a bit.

LONGSHOREMAN

Ya know, these guys aren't so fuckin'

bad.

GROUNDSKEEPER

(in subtitles)

They're still shitty.

TAYLOR

Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a

break, Mel. I gotta get outta here.

WINGO

All right, kick some dirt on me. The

Commissioner'll buy that.

TAYLOR

Right. Good idea.

BROWN

(to Wingo)

Hey, don't you go anywhere. I wanna

have a few words with you.

BROWN

(under his breath)

What are we arguin' about here?

TAYLOR

(struggling as if he

wanted to get at

Wingo)

Fucker called that a ball.

BROWN

You mean the one that was a foot

outside?

TAYLOR

Yeh.

TAYLOR

You still got that great kick. Just

like the first time I ever saw you.

LYNN

You follow me here too?

TAYLOR

Yeh, what did you want to see me

about?

LYNN

What do you mean?

TAYLOR

You wouldn't have been at the game

if you didn't want to see me about

something.

LYNN

(getting out of the

pool)

I just wanted to see you play.

TAYLOR

How was I?

LYNN

You looked good, but you oughta open

your stance a little. They're pitching

you inside.

TAYLOR

I'll try that. You wanna have some

dinner?

LYNN

Sorry, I already ate.

TAYLOR

Right. I forgot your life is different

now.

LYNN

(getting out of the

pool)

Thanks for the race.

TAYLOR

(watching her go)

Anytime.

TAYLOR

Whose place are we at this time?

LYNN

(flustered)

Mine. You follow me again?

TAYLOR

Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I

figured you wanted to see me about

something.

LYNN

I just wanted to see you play.

TAYLOR

How was I?

LYNN

You looked good, but you oughta open

your stance a little. They're pitchin'

you inside.

TAYLOR

I'll try that.

LYNN

I think I oughta tell you that I'm

moving in with Tom.

TAYLOR

Goin' uptown, huh?

LYNN

I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to

lead a regular life. You know, like

an adult maybe. With a house and a

garden and normal hours.

TAYLOR

You think I can't lead a regular

life?

LYNN

You like the life you've had, Jake.

You like hangin' out with the boys,

livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at

midnight, having girls send you their

underwear in the mail. Remember the

surprise party I threw for you when

you made the All-Star team? You never

showed up, but the doorbell rang

once and we all got quiet and hid

behind the furniture. It was a guy

to serve you with a paternity suit.

TAYLOR

That was a hoax. The girl was just

trying to get some publicity.

LYNN

Yes, but you had obviously been with

her. And it happened in front of all

our friends.

TAYLOR

I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements

were dryin' up, my knees were goin',

they were talkin' about sendin' me

down. I was just trying to hold on

to somethin', prove to myself I was

still an All-Star. I don't care about

that anymore. I know I don't have

much time left in baseball. I'm just

a guy trying to put his life back

together. Thinkin' about you was the

only thing that kept me goin' in

Mexico.

LYNN

I've come back to you too many times,

Jake. I can't afford to believe you

anymore.

TAYLOR

I guess this is our last hurrah then.

LYNN

I guess so. Did you really read "Moby

Dick?"

TAYLOR

Cover to cover.

TAYLOR

When's the wedding?

LYNN

October third.

TAYLOR

Your mom and dad like this guy?

LYNN

You're still their favorite.

TAYLOR

Gonna be a big wedding?

LYNN

Tom doesn't like big weddings. You

coulda read Plot Outlines of 101

Great Novels.

TAYLOR

Where?

LYNN

At any library.

TAYLOR

I mean the wedding.

LYNN

All Saints on Euclid.

TAYLOR

Nice church.

LYNN

Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?

TAYLOR

Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am

I invited?

LYNN

Where?

TAYLOR

To the wedding.

LYNN

If you want. Maybe you really did

read it.

LYNN

This doesn't change anything, you

know. We were always good at this.

TAYLOR

Lynn?

LYNN

What?

TAYLOR

The zipper on your skirt is stuck.

LYNN

Use your imagination.

DISSOLVE TO:

RACHEL

Well, my worst fears have been

confirmed. We're 60 and 60, nine

games out of first, and only two out

of the first division. Who do those

guys think they are?

DONOVAN

Maybe you just have to accept the

fact that they're not as bad as you'd

hoped.

RACHEL

I don't have to accept anything. Our

attendance is only beginning to rise.

If we can force a losing streak for

a week or two, we can still turn

this thing around. The fans are used

to losers here. At the first sign of

a slump they'll give up on this team.

DONOVAN

What's left to do? You've taken away

everything you can.

RACHEL

Not everything.

CUT TO:

TEMPLE

Memo says we'll only be usin' this

for short trips.

BROWN

Good thing we don't play anybody in

Europe.

HAYES

Can I borrow one of those, man? They

don't have any magazines on this

bus.

TAYLOR

Sure, go ahead. I think my reading

days are over.

HAYES

Macbeth. This a good one?

TAYLOR

(pointing to his stack

of Classics)

These are all Hall of Famers.

HAYES

(to Dorn)

I'll trade you Song of Hiawatha for

The Deerslayer.

DORN

Naw, I'm not into Song of Hiawatha.

HAYES

All right then, how about Crime and

Punishment?

DORN

Yeh, that sounds pretty good. That's

a detective story, right?

HAYES

Yeh.

DRIVER

This is it. The Sheffield Arms.

BROWN

I don't know if we can survive any

more of these economy measures.

DOYLE (V.O.)

So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his

only other appearance against the

Yankees, will see what he can do

with the Bronx Bombers this time.

Vaughn, after a slow start, has come

on lately and now leads the American

League in strikeouts with 221.

VOICE

Hey, jailbird!

TAYLOR

(throwing the ball

back)

C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.

TAYLOR

What's the problem, Rick? You're

throwin' basketballs up there. That

guy in the dugout botherin' you?

VAUGHN

Naw, I'm all right.

TAYLOR

Forget him. Worry about the guys

carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's

get nasty.

BROWN

I thought now that Vaughn had some

control, he was ready for the Yankees.

PEPPER

Not quite yet.

DOYLE (V.O.)

So, Vaughn pitches in some tough

luck here as the Yankees put together

as few squib hits and take a 6-0

lead.

DOYLE

Well, the Indians made a gallant

comeback today, but fell one run

short as the Yankees held on for a 6-

5 victory, although they didn't do

squat after the first inning. Anyway,

if the bus makes it here from the

hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow

night. Till then, this is Harry Doyle,

saying so long, everybody, and Happy

Hunting.

DONOVAN

Mind if I join you?

BROWN

(surprised to see him)

Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin'

here?

DONOVAN

Just wanted to get out on the road.

You damn near pulled one out today.

BROWN

Someday we'll figure out how to beat

those guys.

DONOVAN

Ya know, you've done a helluva job

this year.

BROWN

Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a

helluva job.

DONOVAN

With this club it is.

BROWN

Ya know, when I first got to camp I

figured this team had no chance. I

was just hopin' we'd win enough that

I could stay on and really start to

build something here. But there's a

lotta talent on this club, Charlie.

The veterans are starting to play

back to form and the rookies are

developing faster than I thought.

There's two or three potential all-

stars in there. I think we're a first

division team right now.

DONOVAN

You really believe that, don't you?

BROWN

I know it. All we need is something

to bring it all together.

DONOVAN

Rachel Phelps would never allow that.

BROWN

What do you mean?

DONOVAN

She doesn't want you in the first

division. She doesn't even want you

in Cleveland.

CUT TO:

BROWN

(addressing the group)

I got somethin' I think you oughta

know about. I wouldn't have known

about it myself if Charlie Donovan

hadn't told me, although I shoulda

guessed it from everything that's

happened. It seems that Mrs. Phelps

doesn't think too highly of our worth.

BROWN

She put this team together because

she thought we'd be bad enough to

finish dead last, knockin' attendance

down to the point where she could

move the team to Miami.

(pause)

And get rid of all of us for better

personnel.

DORN

Even me?

BROWN

Even you, Dorn.

HAYES

In other words, Phelps thinks we're

all dinks. That we don't belong in

the big leagues.

BROWN

That's about it.

HARRIS

What if we don't finish last?

BROWN

She'll replace you with somebody who

will. After this season, you'll all

be sent back to the minors or given

your outright release.

(pause)

So, all we're gonna get is this one

year.

TAYLOR

I don't know about the rest of you,

but I've been playin' baseball since

I was five years old. I've had some

good years and some years to forget.

I've burned out my knees... I don't

think I have three fingers that work

right... I've lost most of the money

I made and baseball has messed up my

personal life from time to time. But

I know one thing... I can still play

this game a little. And I'd like to

know who in this room thinks they're

the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is lookin'

for?

TAYLOR

Well, then, I guess there's only one

thing to do.

DORN

What's that?

TAYLOR

Win the whole fuckin' thing.

BROWN

I figure it's gonna take 32 more

victories to win this thing. Every

time we win, we peel a square.

FARMER

(to TV camera)

You remember bra burning in the '70's,

well, the newest thing in Cleveland

is doormat burning as Indian fans

are standing up and saying "We won't

be stepped on anymore".

TEAM

(in unison)

Hello, do you know us?

TAYLOR

We're a Major League baseball team,

but since we haven't won a pennant

in thirty years, nobody recognizes

us, not even in our own hometown.

VAUGHN

That's why we carry the American

Express card. No matter how far out

of first we are, it keeps us from

getting shut out at our favorite

hotels and restaurants.

CERRANO

So if you're looking for some big

league clout, apply for the little

green home run hitter.

TAYLOR

Look what it's done for us. People

still don't recognize us, but...

(whispering)

...we're in the first division now.

HAYES

The American Express card. Don't

steal home without it.

VOICE

We interrupt this program to bring

you the following special bulletin.

FARMER

Good evening, everybody. The

incredible has happened. The Indians

have finished the regular season in

a first place tie with the New York

Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win

over the Tigers in Detroit today.

There will be a one-game playoff

here in Cleveland the day after

tomorrow to decide the Eastern

Division Championship, the Indians

having won the coin flip held just

moments ago in the American League

office. We'll have further details

on the news at 11, but for now, get

your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.

HAYES

Hey, not bad for a has-been and a

never-will-be.

TAYLOR

We haven't won anything yet. We still

got one more to go.

DORN

Hey, Taylor, there's a coupla drop-

dead Annies outside. One of 'em says

she used to know you pretty good.

Brunette, great rack...

TAYLOR

Darla.

DORN

Yeh. What doya say we chat 'em up?

TAYLOR

(without much

enthusiasm)

I don't know...

DORN

C'mon, you're not gonna keep moonin'

over that library chick, are you?

Forget her, she's gone.

CHARLES

The Indians are spending the night

in Detroit and will bus back to

Cleveland in the morning. We're going

to go back now to Ross Farmer who's

standing by at the Hotel Stanley

where the Indians are staying in

Detroit. Ross?

FARMER

Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the

Indians are in high spirits tonight,

looking forward to their showdown

with the Yankees. Who will start

that game is still a matter of some

conjecture.

DARLA

You still got that black Corvette?

The one that the sound system took

up the whole trunk?

TAYLOR

No, I had to sell it.

DARLA

I thought they gave them to ya.

TAYLOR

Not after your knees go bad.

DARLA

That's all right, you'll be gettin'

a new one now.

TAYLOR

Darla, I don't think I can do this.

DARLA

What do you mean? We did this between

innings once.

TAYLOR

I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.

DARLA

(resigned)

Happens to the best of them sooner

or later. What's her name?

DARLA

So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna

devote a whole chapter to you in my

book.

LYNN

Excuse me. I was in town for a

conference and thought I'd drop by,

but I can see you're busy...

TAYLOR

Lynn, wait...

VAUGHN

You wanted to see me?

BROWN

Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you

that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow

against the Yankees, even though

it's your turn in the rotation.

BROWN

He's got more experience and a little

better record against the Yankees.

VAUGHN

Yeh, sure. Whatever's best for the

team.

BROWN

Don't read anything into it, Rick.

You're one of the guys that got us

here.

VAUGHN

Yeh, okay.

VOICE

You mind if I join you?

VAUGHN

I don't think I'd be very good company

tonight.

SUZANNE

Why not?

VAUGHN

Nothin'. Job problem.

VAUGHN

I'm, ah, a ball player.

SUZANNE

I know, but that's not why I came

over. I don't chase ball players.

VAUGHN

Why did you come over then?

SUZANNE

Because you're the sexiest man I've

ever laid eyes on, and you look like

you could use a... friend.

VAUGHN

Where you goin'?

SUZANNE

I've gotta get home.

VAUGHN

I didn't even get your name.

SUZANNE

Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn

VAUGHN

(having heard that

name someplace before)

Suzanne Dorn?

SUZANNE

Mrs. Suzanne Dorn.

(kissing him on the

forehead)

So long. You're a great kid.

SUZANNE

(nonchalant)

Hello, Jake.

TAYLOR

Hello, Suzanne.

TAYLOR

Vaughn?

VAUGHN

I swear to God I didn't know who she

was.

DISSOLVE TO:

TAYLOR

You look beautiful.

LYNN

Thank you. I didn't think you'd come.

TAYLOR

I can't stay.

(indicating the team)

We gotta get to the park.

LYNN

Good luck today, Jake.

TAYLOR

Yeh, you too.

(pause)

Tell me one thing. The night you

came up to my hotel -- was there

really a library conference?

LYNN

No, I came to see you.

TAYLOR

Too bad it didn't work out better. I

just wanna say I'm sorry for all the

things I've put you through over the

years.

LYNN

Even for last night?

TAYLOR

Can't be sorry for that. Nothing

happened.

LYNN

Then you weren't defending my honor

again?

TAYLOR

I didn't have to. She knew she was

outclassed.

RACHEL

Come in.

RACHEL

Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya?

BROWN

I wanted to hand in my resignation

before you had a chance to fire me.

RACHEL

What do you mean?

BROWN

I know what you been tryin' to do

with this team. After the season, I

want no part of it.

RACHEL

Well, I knew I could count on Charlie

to tell somebody. I was just afraid

he might take too long.

BROWN

Why would you want him to tell

somebody?

RACHEL

So you'd tell the team, hopefully

getting them mad enough to knock

themselves out trying to prove they

belonged in this league. I think it

worked.

BROWN

You tryin' to make me believe you

wanted us to win all along?

BROWN

Bullshit. What about the plane, the

bus, the bad hotels...

RACHEL

We were broke. We couldn't afford

anything better. Donald left the

team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had

another losing season, I would have

had to sell the team. I knew we

couldn't win with the team we had,

so I decided to bring in new players

and see how they'd do with the proper

motivation. There was never any offer

from Miami. I made it all up.

BROWN

Why should I believe any of this?

Now that we're winnin' it's easy for

you to jump on the bandwagon.

RACHEL

If I'd really wanted you to lose,

all I had to do was send the best

players back to the minors. But I

didn't, did I?

RACHEL

You think this was all an accident?

I personally scouted every member of

this team, except Hayes, of course.

He was a surprise. They all had flaws

which concealed their real talent,

or I wouldn't have been able to get

them. But I knew if anyone could

straighten them out, you could. And

if you tell them any of this, I will

fire you.

RACHEL

I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em

tonight.

TAYLOR

I don't know what Dorn's wife is up

to, but I think it'd be best if you

dressed early and got out to the

bullpen before Dorn comes in.

HAYES

(to Taylor)

We got a problem. Cerrano wants some

extra power for tonight. He's lookin'

to sacrifice a live chicken. We can't

have people pukin' in the locker

room before the game.

TAYLOR

Tell him not to worry, I'll take

care of it.

DORN

Bye bye, honey, wish me luck.

SUZANNE

Before you go, there's something I

wanta tell you.

CUT TO:

COLORMAN

Here's your bourbon.

DOYLE

Won't need it tonight.

DORN

You know where Vaughn is?

TAYLOR

Nope. Haven't seen him.

DORN

Let me know if you do. I wanna have

a little talk with him.

CERRANO

Where's my chicken?

TAYLOR

It's comin' in now.

TAYLOR

One whole chicken, like you said.

CERRANO

But it no alive.

TAYLOR

Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this.

He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw

chicken.

CUT TO:

DOYLE

Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding

you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful

Municipal Stadium, where tonight

before a capacity crowd of 75,000

screaming featherheads, the braves

of the Cuyahoga will leave their

teepees in search of Cleveland's

first League Championship in over 30

years. Standing in the way, their

long time nemesis, the New York

Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway,

who have beaten the Indians like a

tom-tom all year long.

BROWN

All right, guys, let's take it to

'em.

DOYLE

Still nothing -- nothing, top of the

seventh, two down. Harris has been

in trouble all night, but has battled

his way out with the help of some

great defensive plays.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Uh oh, this one's tagged. Deep center

field. Way back. Way back.

DOYLE (V.O.)

It's off the reservation, home run.

And the Yankees lead it 2-0.

RACHEL

Shit.

CUT TO:

DOYLE (V.O.)

Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the

seventh. The Indians running out of

chances.

DOYLE (V.O.)

That'll bring on Cerrano, hitless

tonight. As a matter of fact, he

hasn't touched the ball yet.

BROWN

Damn, havin' trouble with the curve

ball again.

HAYES

We should've gotten him a live

chicken.

CERRANO

I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to

you, I stand up for you. If you no

help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu.

I do it myself.

DOYLE

Long drive, deep centerfield. Way

back. It might be. It could be. The

ball is... Downtown, welcome to the

Happy Hunting Ground. The game is

tied.

DOYLE

Two down in the top of the ninth,

still tied at 2, Harris working on

an eight-hitter.

CUT TO:

DOYLE (V.O.)

Activity continues in the pen, as

Harris is really digging himself a

hole now. He got the first two

hitters, and then gave up a single

and a double and has now gone 3-0 to

Cheevers.

DOYLE (V.O.)

High, ball four and they're loaded

for Haywood, the biggest Indian killer

of them all.

BROWN

(taking the ball from

Harris)

You pitched a hell of a game, Steve.

Take a seat and we'll see if we can

get this guy for ya.

BROWN

Give me Vaughn.

TAYLOR

(surprised)

You want Vaughn?

BROWN

I know he hasn't done real well

against this guy, but I got a hunch

he's due.

BROWN

Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard

stuff in. Curve him on the hands,

bust him away, and don't get up with

anything. You listenin' to me Rick?

BROWN

(Patting him on the

butt)

O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go

get him.

TAYLOR

C'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you

been waitin' your whole life for.

DOYLE

O.K. Vaughn has finished his warmup

and we're ready to...

TAYLOR

(seeing it)

Oh, shit.

DORN

Let's cut through the crap. I only

got one thing to say to you. Just

rear back and strike this motherfucker

out.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Haywood steps in, the American League

triple crown winner. .341 average,

48 homers, 121 R.B.I.'s. He's homered

the only two times he's faced Vaughn.

TAYLOR

All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.

TAYLOR

(to Haywood)

All right, looks like the boy is

pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't

it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two

foot hole comin' out.

TAYLOR

(for Haywood's ears)

Let's see, what should we call now.

Let's see how he feels about old

number one.

TAYLOR

Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow-

through. Keep it up, I'll show you

the ball sometime.

BROWN

Forget the curveball. Go with the

heater.

TAYLOR

Well, shit, all these pitches to

choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin'

different this time.

TAYLOR

And if I don't see you again, Haywood,

have a nice winter. Okay, buddy?

DOYLE (V.O.)

Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters

and the Yankees are blown down. No

runs, two hits, three left on, and,

are you ready, Cleveland? We go to

the bottom of the ninth, still tied

at two.

DOYLE

(to his color man)

Can you believe this, Monty?

DOYLE (V.O.)

Two down in the ninth, Hayes steps

in hitting .291, trying to get

something going for the Tribe.

DOYLE (V.O.)

And Horton is wasting no time. He's

goin' to the Duke.

DOYLE

Duke leads the league in saves,

strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.

BROWN

Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch-

hit for you here. You're 0 for 18

against Duke. Plus you're beat to

shit you can hardly walk, there's no

way you can get around on this guy's

fast ball. So I want the absolute

truth here. Can you beat this guy?

TAYLOR

Yeh.

BROWN

Okay.

BROWN

(to Pepper)

Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't

want Taylor takin' too many strikes.

PEPPER

What's he doing?

BROWN

Flashing some signals. That's a hell

of an idea.

DOYLE (V.O.)

What's this? Taylor is pointing to

the bleachers, calling his shot.

DOYLE (V.O.)

(Taylor points again)

Unbelievable. They're on their feet

here, stomping, clapping. C'mon,

join in wherever you are out there.

Let's hear you, Cleveland.

CUT TO:

DOYLE (V.O.)

Hayes is gonna try to score! Here

comes the throw. He slides. He is...

DOYLE

...Safe. The Indians win it. The

Indians win. Oh my God, the Indians

win it!!

THE END
