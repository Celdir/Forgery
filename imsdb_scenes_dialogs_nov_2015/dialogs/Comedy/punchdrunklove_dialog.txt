CUT TO:

BARRY

...yes I'm still on hold...

OPERATOR

And what was this?

BARRY

I'm looking at your advertisement

for the airline promotion and

giveaway?

OPERATOR

This is "Fly With Us?"

BARRY

It's hard to understand because it

says in addition to but I can't

exactly understand in addition to

what because there's actually

nothing to add it too...

OPERATOR

I think that's a type-o then, that

would be a mistake.

BARRY

So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten

purchases of any of your Healthy

Choice products equals five hundred

miles and then with the coupon the

same purchases would value one

thousand miles --

OPERATOR

That's it.

BARRY

Do you realize that the monetary

value of this promotion and the

prize is potentially worth more

than the purchases?

OPERATOR

I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

BARRY

Can I call you back if I have any

further questions...? Can I get

your extension?

OPERATOR

It's extension 215 if you want to

try me back.

BARRY

Ok. Thank you.

CUT TO:

BARRY

....I'm not exactly sure what that

means...

VOICE

If they break or something. What is

it, plastic?

BARRY

It's a plastic, yeah.

VOICE

Right. Alright, lemme call you

first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run

the numbers, see what's what and

I'll give you a call back --

BARRY

Did you have my home phone number?

VOICE

For what?

BARRY

If you wanted to call me back I

could...

VOICE

I'm fine, I have your work number.

BARRY

Ok...because of the time difference

if you needed to call me early?

VOICE

It's fine. I can just get you at

your office.

BARRY

Ok.

VOICE

Ok, bye, bye.

BARRY

Bye.

LENA

Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

BARRY

No.

LENA

They're not open yet?

BARRY

They don't get opened until eight.

LENA

Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

BARRY

I don't know.

LENA

I thought they opened at seven.

(beat)

If I left my car would it be ok?

BARRY

I don't know.

LENA

Do you know them.

BARRY

Not very well.

LENA

Can I ask you, can I trust to leave

my keys with you and give them to

you so that when they get here you

could give them to them?

BARRY

Ok.

LENA

You think it's ok where I left it,

right there?

BARRY

I think that'll be fine.

LENA

There's a piano in the street.

BARRY

Yeah.

LENA

Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank

you for your help.

BARRY

Thank you.

LENA

Maybe I'll see you later, when I

pick up my car?

BARRY

Ok.

BARRY

Sorry about that.

CUSTOMER

So you're coming tonight, right?

BARRY

Yes, indeed, yes I am.

ELIZABETH

There's this girl, this friend of

mine from work that I think is

really cute and really cool and I

want you to meet her so I was

thinking about bringing her to the

party tonight.

BARRY

Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

ELIZABETH

Why?

BARRY

Well I don't want to do something

like that.

ELIZABETH

She's my friend and you should meet

her. You'd like her.

BARRY

Yeah, but please don't do that.

ELIZABETH

I'm not really asking you, I'm

telling you.

BARRY

Yeah but please don't do that:

everyone would be looking at me.

ELIZABETH

It's a free country, we can look at

you if we want to.

BARRY

Yes but I get tense and I feel like

I can't be myself if that happens.

ELIZABETH

That's your fault not mine.

BARRY

I don't think I'm going to the party.

ELIZABETH

So it's ok if I bring her.

BARRY

Please don't.

ELIZABETH

She's really cute and she's really

nice.

BARRY

...please, I just don't want it....

ELIZABETH

....wait a minute: why is this

about you now? Why is it always

about you?

BARRY

Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

ELIZABETH

I'm trying to be your friend.

BARRY

I know.

ELIZABETH

I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

BARRY

Well, yeah, thank you, but --

ELIZABETH

guess none of this matters and I'll

bring her anyway.

All I'm trying to do is be your

friend.

we used to call you gay and you'd

get all mad?

KATHLEEN

do you remember?

BARRY

I don't really remember that.

KATHLEEN

Yes you do. We were calling you Gay

Boy and you got so mad....

BARRY

Yes, yes, right.

SUSAN

We're trying to remember why you

had the hammer in the first place?

The hammer that you threw....why

did you have it?

SUSAN

You don't remember -- you had the

hammer and you threw it -- ?

girl for you but you wouldn't let

me do it.

BARRY

Hello everyone.

KAREN

Did you think that we'd all be

looking at you?

BARRY

No, no, no.

KAREN

Well it's just not true. We

You just said very food.

BARRY

Did I say that?

WALTER

Yeah.

hungry.....

ELIZABETH

You're lucky. She couldn't come

anyway --

BARRY

Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

ELIZABETH

She couldn't come I said. Are you

WALTER

Yeah.

BARRY

I don't like the way I am sometimes.

(beat)

Can you help me?

WALTER

Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of

help do you think I can give you?

BARRY

I know that. Maybe you know other

doctors?

WALTER

Like a psychiatrist?

BARRY

I don't have anyone to talk to

things about and I understand it's

confidential with a doctor - I'm

embarrassed about that and I don't

want my sisters to know?

WALTER

You want a number for a

psychiatrist, I can get you one,

that's not a problem. but what

exactly is wrong?

BARRY

I don't know if there's anything

wrong with me because I don't know

how other people are.....Sometimes

I cry a lot.....for no reason.

BARRY

Please don't tell my sisters.

I'm not being scared, you're just

going to rag me if I do this --

ELIZABETH

I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I

do this just to rag you?

BARRY

I don't know.

ELIZABETH

I'll leave then, I'll go to get

something from my car, go away so

you don't feel pressure. Can I ask

you a serious question:

BARRY

What?

ELIZABETH

Did you ask Walter to get you a

shrink?

(beat)

Barry, did you ask Walter to get

you a shrink? What's wrong with you?

Are you ok?

BARRY

I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

ELIZABETH

You're being weird again, see. Come

on. Please don't be weird.

ELIZABETH

I gotta grab something from my car....

LENA

We should be going --

ELIZABETH

sister's birthday party last night,

Elizabeth had invited me and I

couldn't make it --

BARRY

It's fine. It was fun, though.

LENA

It must be weird for you to have so

many sisters?

BARRY

No. Not at all. It's nice.

a lot of family, it must be nice.

BARRY

Do you have brothers or sisters?

LENA

No. I'm the exact opposite --

BARRY

That must be nice. That must be

really, really, really great.

LENA

It's terrible, no.

LENA

What do you do with all this pudding?

BARRY

That's not mine it's one of the

the time. I'm going to Hawaii on

Friday.

BARRY

That's great -- Hawaii. I was

thinking about going there.

LENA

Really?

BARRY

I was, yeah, I was thinking about

going there for business --

LENA

LENA

over there and if you were there we

could say hello to each other or

something --

BARRY

-- yeah that would be great, if I

was gonna go but I'm not exactly

sure, I have so much goin on

here -- A lot depends on this thing

I might do here and if that happens

I can't go and if it doesn't happen

then I probably will, but I doubt it.

ELIZABETH

I can't find that thing in my car,

I can't find it so I'll just get it

that was someone else. Also: This

pudding is not mine. Also: I'm

But it's gotta wait until my knee

LATISHA

You have to do it now.

JIM

If we drive there it's a problem.

LATISHA

Dean will loan you one of his cars.

JIM

Which one?

LATISHA

You have to talk to him --

DAVID

How do you know he's rich?

LATISHA

Because I know, I just know. I

mean, I talked to him, I know.

California. Los Angeles.

Right now.

LATISHA

Let's go talk to Dean.

Hey guys.

Hey, Dean.

LATISHA

So they'll go.

DEAN

I'm only paying two of you guys.

DAVID

That's cool.

DEAN

When can you leave?

DAVID

As soon as you want.

DEAN

I want you to go right away, I

think that's best. I also need you

to check out a car for me down

DEAN

You wanna fuck around, asshole? You

wanna get tough, wanna see me kick

some motherfuck around here?

REGULAR JOE

Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --

I'll relax your fucking head --

this is my personal space, man,

I thought Latisha said you would --

DEAN

talking about --

DAVID

It's....whatever....that's not cool.

DEAN

David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It

doesn't make sense if you think

about it in a fair deal like sense.

Ok? It's business. Seriously. One

hundred dollars for two days work

is a lot more than your family is

making sitting around your house.

I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.

Just stop.

DEAN

...keys for the track. You have to

gas it up and save the receipts on

that. His address. We have a

business address too if you need

that -- but hit him at his house

first, see what this little bad boy

is all about and shake him up --

give him a little doe-see-doe --

LATISHA

Uch. Shut up, Dean.

DEAN

What's the problem?

LATISHA

You don't need to talk all macho,

"shake him out, little bad boy."

Whatever -- you're not an action

hero, tough guy, you're not a

gangster --

DEAN

Flinchy. That's what I thought.

Shut up.

(to Greg)

Call me when you see this guy --

check him out see what's what. She

asked him for seven fifty when she

was on the phone with him, so --

just call me when you get there.

DEAN

This is this place called Ace

Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't

know exactly where this is and I

don't understand these maps so just

go there and check it out. It's a

'61 AC Cobra that this old guy says

is fine, but I need to figure out

why he's only asking 23 for it. So

take a look, the whole thing, call

me about that, if it seems alright

then I'll head down there and check

it out.

DAVID

Ok.

DEAN

That's it.

DAVID

Can we maybe ask for more money on

this?

LATISHA

Why?

DAVID

...because it's California? I mean

it's like a nine or ten hour drive.

It's not like going to Salt Lake

and getting the Mormon's, it's

different...

CUT TO:

JUMP CUT TO:

LONG DISSOLVE TO:

LENA

Who is it?

BARRY

It's Barry.

LENA

Hi.

CUT TO:

LENA

So I want to tell you something, I

gotta tell you: I saw a picture of

you guys, your sisters and you and

I saw your picture and I really

wanted to meet you.

(beat)

I came to drop my car off there on

purpose, to try and meet you.

BARRY

...really? That's nice...are you

lying?

LENA

...I thought I should tell you. I

didn't want to get too far along on

going out and be hiding something --

BARRY

That's very nice. Thank you. Thank

you for saying that.

(beat)

You're friends with my sister?

LENA

Yeah.

BARRY

How long have you known her?

LENA

About six months.

BARRY

You like her?

LENA

Yeah. Yeah we get along well.

(beat)

You didn't get along with her very

well?

BARRY

Did you really come to meet me on

purpose or are you lying about that?

LENA

No, no. I did.

BARRY

That's nice. It's nice.

(beat)

I've been looking around a lot

lately at promotional giveaways,

cross promotional work by some

companies. Do you remember all that

pudding?

LENA

Yeah.

BARRY

So that pudding was bought, I

bought that pudding because of a

pretty interesting promotion that's

sponsored by Healthy Choice and

American Airlines. It's designed to

encourage airline travel and

obviously designed to encourage

buying Healthy Choice products.

They make frozen meals, deli meats,

pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice

creams, this sort of thing.....

LENA

Yeah?

BARRY

....I'm sorry....I lost my

thoughts, what I was saying....

LENA

You were talking about the

promotion --

BARRY

-- the promotion says: buy any 10

Healthy Choice products and get 500

miles of airline travel or 1,000

for purchases made with a special

coupon. So in the supermarket, you

notice their products, first you

notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken

Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty

good deal....but then I noticed

they had soup at 89 cents a

can.....and you start to do the

math and you start to notice that

it's a really amazing deal because

I stumbled across the pudding at 25

cents a cup. Now the crucial thing

is the bar codes on the label.

That's those little bar codes, you

know? The universal product codes?

LENA

Yeah.

BARRY

That's what's used to redeem the

mileage, so in noticing the

pudding, each cup had an individual

bar code -- in other words: Two

dollars and fifty cents for ten

cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add

in the coupon: it's one thousand.

You see?

LENA

Yeah.

BARRY

You see?

LENA

Yeah, no, I see --

BARRY

You see if you spent $3,000 dollars

on pudding you could earn over one

million frequent flyer miles.

LENA

That's insane. That is really,

really crazy. That's just crazy if

you spend three thousand dollars on

pudding.

BARRY

....yeah....

LENA

So that was your pudding?

BARRY

....No....

LENA

I'm sorry. I thought you said --

BARRY

No I didn't say that.

LENA

I thought you said you bought all

that pudding --

BARRY

My friend Carlos is doing it who

works with me. It's his. It's his

pudding, he's doing it. It's not

mine. He's crazy. I told him not to

do it. He's the one who's insane.

He only spent about one hundred

dollars so far though --

LENA

Your sister was telling me a pretty

funny story about you, when you

guys were kids and you were

building a ramp for your dog and

you threw a hammer through a window?

Is that right? You threw a hammer

through a sliding glass door?

BARRY

I don't remember that, she might be

lying. I have to go the bathroom.
