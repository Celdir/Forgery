An Original Screenplay

REVISED SECOND DRAFT

Registered WGAW

November 17, 1987

VERONICA (V.O.)

Heather told me she teaches people

Real Life.

VERONICA (V.O.)

She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.

If you want to fuck with the eagles,

you have to learn to fly.

VERONICA (V.O.)

I said so you teach people how to

spread their wings and fly. She

said Yes.

VERONICA (V.O.)

I said You're Beautiful.

HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)

God, come

on

Veronica!

VERONICA

What's your damage, Heather? You

ruined my...

HEATHER MCNAMARA

God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,

blame Heather. She told me to haul

your ass into the caf pronto. Back

me up, Heather.

HEATHER DUKE

Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

VERONICA

Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

VERONICA

(submissively)

Hello, Heather.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of

Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge

a hot and horny but realistically

low-key note in Kurt's handwriting

and we'll slip it into Martha

Dumptruck's lunch tray.

VERONICA

Shit, Heather. I don't have anything

against Martha Dunnstock.

HEATHER CHANDLER

You don't have anything

for

her

either. Come on, it'll be Very. The

note'll give her shower nozzle

masturbation material for weeks.

VERONICA

I'll think about it.

HEATHER CHANDLER

(looking off)

Don't think.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica

needs something to write on.

Heather, bend over.

HEATHER CHANDLER

How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Heather Duke, back down.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Dear Martha, you're so sweet..

KURT

It'd be so righteous to be in a

Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler

sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

RAM

Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on

my Johnson and just start spinning

her like a fucking pinwheel.

EARL

Shit. Right.

RAM

Damn right right.

PETER

Come on people, let's give that

leftover lunch money to people

without lunches! Those tater tots

you threw away today are a delicacy

in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!

HEATHER MCNAMARA

(looking to the stand)

God, aren't they fed yet? Do they

even have Thanksgiving in Africa?

VERONICA

(low key sarcasm)

Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater

tots; it's a real party continent.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Sawyer. Guess what today is?

VERONICA

Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So

what's the question?

HEATHER DUKE

Yeah, so what's the question?

HEATHER CHANDLER

God-damn Heather, you were with me

in Study Hall when I thought of it.

Such a pillowcase.

HEATHER DUKE

(hurt)

I forgot.

VERONICA

Hey, this question wouldn't be that

bizarro thing you were babbling

about over the phone last......

HEATHER CHANDLER

Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he

gave me another topic that was

political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

Rebel Without a

Cause

lunchbox. They make eye contact.

BETTY

Sorry Veronica.

VERONICA

Betty Finn. Gosh.....

VERONICA

I'm really sorry I couldn't make it

to your birthday party last month.

BETTY

That's okay. Your Mom said you had

a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip

my own birthday party for a date.

VERONICA

Don't say that.

BETTY

Oh Ronnie, you have to look at

what I dug up the other day.

VERONICA

I was talking with someone!

HEATHER CHANDLER

Color me impressed. I thought you

grew out of Betty Finn.

COURTNEY

Oh great. Here comes Heather.

COURTNEY'S FRIEND

Shit.

The

note is wedged inside it.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,

let me snare a tater.

COURTNEY

Thanks. I just got it last night at

the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

HEATHER CHANDLER

That's pretty very. Now check this out. You

win five million dollars from Publishers

Clearing House, but on the same day Ed

McMahon gives you the check, aliens

land on earth and say they're going

to blow up the world in two days.

What would you do?

KEITH

That's easy. I'd just slide that wad

over to my father. He's like one of

the top brokers in the

state

.

VERONICA

Wake up. In two days, Earth's going

up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.

KEITH

Man, in two days, my dad could

double my money. Triple it.

COURTNEY

If I got that money, I'd give it

all to the poor. Every cent.

VERONICA

You're beautiful.

PETER

Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey

D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.

DENNIS

But that's the Famine Fund money.

PETER

Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat.

If it makes you feel better, bag the

fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.

HEATHER CHANDLER

If you're going to openly be a bitch....

VERONICA

(submissive)

I'm sorry, it's just why can't we

talk to different kinds of people?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I

look like Mother Theresa? If I did,

I probably wouldn't mind talking to

the Geek Squad.

RODNEY

Did you see that? Heather Number

One looked right at us.

BIG CYNIC

It must be love.

VERONICA

Doesn't it bother you that everyone in

the school thinks you're a pirahna?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Like I give a shit. They all want me,

as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped

at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

VERONICA

Pretend you're a missionary saving

a colony of cootie victims.

HEATHER CHANDLER

(giving in)

Whatever. I don't believe this. We're

going to a party at Remington University

tonight and we're brushing up our

conversation skills with the

scum of the school.

GEEK WITH BRACES

No seriously, I'd probably go to

the Pyrimads. With a girl.

GEEK WITH GLASSES

Where you going to get a girl, stud?

K-Mart?

BIG CYNIC

Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on

the last day of Mankind. You

sentimental old fart.

BRACES

Geez, forget it.

VERONICA

What about you Rodney?

RODNEY

(quietly to the others)

I told you she knew my name.

(beat of contemplation)

I'd change my life. New clothes.

New haircut. New house. New home.

HEATHER CHANDLER

How sad! Blowing all your cash on

two days of trying to be hip.

VERONICA

If you're going to openly be a bitch....

HEATHER MCNAMARA

God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.

HEATHER CHANDLER

This is the part I hate. The waiting.

I'd say we're like twenty minutes from

major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Veronica?

VERONICA

Damn..

VERONICA (V.O.)

..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers

are the same. Didn't you see The

Breakfast Club?

HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)

Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl

in the commercials and the videos.

HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)

I'm the blonde in the bikini on the

horse holding a Pepsi can.

HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)

I'm the princess being spanked on the

throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar.

HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)

What do I get out of being friends

with losers. I give them a piece of

a winner and they stain me with loserness.

MATT

You get five million dollars but

some Martians are going to zap you

in two days. You hear that, Clyde?

That's got to be the most spooky-ass

question I've ever heard.

BETTY FINN

I think we should use the money

for an End-of-the-world get-together.

We could invite

guys

.

RAM

I'd pay Madonna one million dollars

to ride my face like the Kentucky

Derby. She should be paying me, though.

FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET

What?

ALL-OUT NERD

This is important. With taxes, I'd

be only getting 3.5 million and....

CLYDE

If you want a good way to go out

before the aliens land, get a lion

from the zoo. Put a remote control

bomb up its butt. When the lion starts

tearing you up, press the bomb button.

You and the lion die like as one.

JACKIE AND STEVE

Cool.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Just imagine somebody like your

quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty

Finn doing a Crest commercial. No

one would buy Crest.

VERONICA

Don't tell me. Crest would be

stained with loserness.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Oh God, here we go...

PETER

A dime increases the time! A buck

brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A

five keeps the neighborhood alive!

A ten and you die without sen!

HEATHER CHANDLER

(to Veronica)

You wanted to become a member of

the most powerful clique in the

school. If I wasn't already the

head of it, I'd want the same thing.

VERONICA

I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?

HEATHER CHANDLER

That episode with the note back

there was for all of us to enjoy,

but you're determined to ruin my day.

VERONICA

(slapping her knee)

We made a girl want to consider

suicide. What a scream. What a jest.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Come on you jerk. You know you used

to have a sense of humor.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

HEATHER DUKE (O.S.)

Veronica, could you come back here?

HEATHER CHANDLER AND HEATHER MCNAMARA

Gross!

VERONICA

A true friend's work is never done.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Color me nauseous.

VERONICA

Maybe you should see a doctor.

HEATHER DUKE

Yeah, maybe.

HEATHER CHANDLER (O.S.)

Come on Heather. We want another

look at today's lunch.

VERONICA

Geez, don't listen to them.

HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)

Did she have the pie or the ice

cream for dessert?

(like a game show host)

And the answer

is

.

HEATHER DUKE

Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in

the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put

up with their bogus nonsense.

VERONICA

Well, you better move Holden out

of the way or he's going to get spewed.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

God Veronica, drool much? His name's

Jason Dean. He's in my American History.

VERONICA

Give me the clipboard.

VERONICA

Hello Jason Dean.

JASON

Greetings and salutations. Call me

J.D. Are you a Heather?

VERONICA

No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may

seem like a stupid question....

J.D.

There are no stupid questions.

VERONICA

If you inherit five million dollars

the same day aliens tell the earth

they're blowing us up in two days,

what would you do?

J.D.

(suavely)

That's the stupidest question I've

ever heard.

RAM

Who does that new kid think he is

with that coat? Bo Diddley?

KURT

Veronica is into his act. No doubt.

RAM

Let's kick his ass.

KURT

Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old

for that crap. Let's give him a

scare though.

the

question.

J.D.

Probably just row on out to the

middle of a lake. Bring along my

sax, some tequila, and some Bach.

VERONICA

How very.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Come on.

VERONICA (to J.D.)

Later.

J.D.

Definitely.

RAM

You going to eat this?

KURT

What did your

boyfriend

say when

you told him you were moving to

Sherwood, Ohio?

RAM

Answer him dick!

KURT

Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria

have a No Fags Allowed Rule?

J.D.

It seems to have an open door policy

for assholes though, doesn't it?

KURT

What did you say dickweed?

J.D.

I'll repeat myself.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

God, they won't expell him. They'll

just suspend him for a week or something.

HEATHER CHANDLER

He used a real gun. They should

throw his ass in jail.

VERONICA

No way. He used blanks. All J.D.

really did was ruin two pairs of

pants...Maybe not even that...

(giggling)

Can you bleach out urine stains?

HEATHER CHANDLER

J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought

you were giving up on high school guys.

VERONICA

Never say never.

HEATHER DUKE

What are you going to do, Heather?

Take the two shots or send me out?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Did you have a brain tumor for

breakfast? First you ask if you can

be red, knowing that I'm

always

red...

HEATHER DUKE

Shit.

HEATHER CHANDLER

(to HEATHER DUKE)

Damn. It's your turn Heather.

HEATHER DUKE

No, it's Heather's turn.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Anyway, I can say never to high

school. I've got David.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

King David.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Maybe when you hit maturity you'll

understand the diff between a Remington

University man like David and a

Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam-

thank-you-maam" Sweeney.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

No way, no day!

VERONICA

Give it up girl!

VERONICA                      HEATHER MCNAMARA

Holy

shit

!               God, that was unbelievable!

HEATHER CHANDLER

What. A. Shot.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

So tonight's the night. Are you

two excited?

HEATHER CHANDLER

I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her

first Remington Party. Blow it tonight

girl and it's keggers with kids all

next year.

VERONICA

(missing her shot)

Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've

been set up with? Witty and urbane

pre-lawyer or albino accountant?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Don't worry. David says he's very

so he's very.

HEATHER DUKE

Why?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Why not?

MOM

Heather, your Mother's here.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Come on whoever wants a ride.

DAD

Take a break Veronica, sit down.

VERONICA

All right.

DAD

So what was the first week of

Spring Vacation withdrawl like?

VERONICA

I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

MOM

Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?

VERONICA

I guess.

MOM

Any contestants worth mentioning?

VERONICA

May

be

. There's kind of a dark

horse now in the running.

DAD

(looking up)

Goddamn. Will somebody please tell

me why I read this spy crap.

VERONICA

(smiling)

Because you're an idiot.

DAD

Oh yeah, that's it.

MOM

(shaking her head)

You two....

VERONICA

Great pate, but I'm going to have

to motor if I want to be ready for

the party tonight.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Corn nuts!

J.D. (O.S.)

You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

VERONICA

No, but if you're nice I'll let

you buy me a Slurpee. You know

your 7-11speak pretty well.

J.D.

I've been moved around all my life;

Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood

Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any

town, any time, I can pop a Ham and

Cheese in the microwave and feast on

a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.

VERONICA

Really? That thing in the caf

today was pretty severe.

J.D.

The extreme always makes an

impression, but you're right, it

was severe. Did you say a Cherry

or Coke Slurpee?

VERONICA

I didn't. Cherry.

VERONICA

Great bike.

J.D.

Just a humble perk from my Dad's

Construction company or should I

say Deconstruction company?

VERONICA

I don't know. Should you?

J.D.

My father seems to enjoy tearing

things down more than putting things up.

Seen the commerical? "Bringing every

State to a Higher State."

VERONICA

Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's

Fred Dean Construction. Must be

rough. Moving place to place.

J.D.

Everybody's life's got static. Is

your life perfect?

VERONICA

(gently joking)

Sure, I'm on my way to a party

at Remington University.

VERONICA

It's not perfect. I don't really

like my friends.

J.D.

I don't really like your friends either.

VERONICA

It's like they're just people I

work with and our job is being

popular and shit.

J.D.

Maybe it's time for a vacation.

DAVID

Throw your coats on the bed, girls.

WHINING STUDENT

That exam was so bogus.

COED ONE

Oh I

know

. Which exam?

DAVID

Veronica, this is Brad.

BRAD

Excellent. Did you girls bring

your partying slippers?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Yeah, let's party.

DAVID

She loves to party.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Dear Diary, I want to kill and you

have to believe.....damn pen!

VERONICA (V.O.)

You have to believe it's for more

than selfish reasons. More than a

spoke in my menstrual cycle. You

have to believe me.

BRAD

So, are you a cheerleader?

VERONICA

(dealing with a jerk)

No, not at all.

BRAD

You're pretty enough to be one.

VERONICA

Gee, thanks.

BRAD

It's so great to be able to talk

to a girl and not have to ask

"What's your major?" I hate that.

BRAD

So when you go to college, what kind

of subjects do you think you'll study?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Come on David, let's go back to the party.

DAVID

(unzipping his pants)

Don't worry, we will. You're just so

hot tonight. I can't control myself.

BRAD

So what do you say we head up to my

room and have a real party. I've got

the best Windham Hill C.D. collection

in the dorm.

BIG AMIABLE STUDENT

Brad-man, Robinson's looking for

you. He says he owes you for blow

and he just got some product himself.

BRAD

You're kidding. That pecker actually

scored something on his own?

BIG AMIABLE STUDENT

(ambling off)

He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up.

BRAD

Excellent. Veronica, ever do

cocaine

?

VERONICA

Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV

anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.

BRAD

Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't

drinking and driving?

VERONICA

Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?

BRAD

Hey, don't run away now.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Seventeen is the last year Mom buys

the Twinkies. When you make the

jump from working weekends at Pizza

Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you

lose something. Not innocence--power.

VERONICA

J.F.K.!

VERONICA (V.O.)

Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm

allowed an understanding that my

parents and these Remington University

assholes have chosen to ignore. I

understand I must stop Heather.

BRAD

How's my little cheerleader? Now I

know everyone at your high school

isn't so uptight, come

on

.

VERONICA

Hey really, I don't feel so great.

BRAD

Let's do it on the coats. It'll

be excellent.

VERONICA

I have a little prepared speech I

give when my suitor wants more

than I'd like to give him....

Gee Blank, I had a nice....

BRAD

Save the speeches for Malcom X.

I just wanna get laid.

VERONICA

You don't deserve my fucking speech!

HEATHER CHANDLER

What's your damage? Brad says

you're being a real cooze.

VERONICA

Heather, I feel awful, like I'm

going to throw up. Can we jam, please?

HEATHER CHANDLER

No. Hell no.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Betty Finn was a true friend and I

sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs

and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd

be like offing the Wicked Witch of the

West. Or is it East?

West

! I sound

like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing

her aerobicized ass but tonight let me

dream of a world without Heather. A

world where I am free.

HEATHER CHANDLER

You stupid cunt!

VERONICA

You goddamn bitch!

HEATHER CHANDLER

You were nothing before you met me!

You were playing Barbies with Betty

Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a

Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout

Cookie! I got you into a Remington

Party! What's my thanks? It's on the

hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!

VERONICA

Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

HEATHER CHANDLER

(totally in control)

Monday morning, you're history. I'll

tell everyone about tonight. Transfer

to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson.

No one at Westerburg's going to let

you play their reindeer games.

J.D.

Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.

VERONICA

(exhaling deeply)

S'okay....

J.D.

I saw the croquet set-up in the back.

Up for a match?

VERONICA

Sure. But I'm Blue.

J.D. (V.O.)

Goddamn, no wonder you looked so

mangled when I came through the window.

VERONICA (V.O.)

I've always treated Heather's teen

queen power plays as bullshit.....

VERONICA (V.O.)

But I'm really scared. Who am I going

to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound

like an Afterschool Special.

J.D. (V.O.)

That was my first game of Strip

Croquet, you know. I thank you.

VERONICA (V.O.)

You're welcome. It's a lot more

interesting than just flinging

off your clothes and boning away

on the neighbor's swing set.

J.D. (O.S.)

Well, I don't know. There's

something to be said for...Ouch!

VERONICA

What a night.

VERONICA

What a life. I almost moved into high

school out of sixth grade because I

was some genius. We all decided to

chuck the idea because I'd have

trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.

VERONICA

Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use

my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss

to wear and how to hit three keggers

before curfew. Some genius.

J.D.

Heather Chandler is one bitch that

deserves to die.

VERONICA

Killing her won't solve anything.

J.D.

A well-timed lightning bolt through

her window and Monday morning, all

the other heathers, shit, everybody

would be cast fucking adrift.

VERONICA

Well then, I'll pray for rain.

J.D.

See the condoms in the grass over

there. We killed tonight, Veronica.

We murdered our baby.

VERONICA

Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.

J.D.

Just saying it's not hard to end a life.

VERONICA

There's a big difference between

the most popular girl in the school

and dead sperm.

J.D.

I guess I don't know what the hell

I'm talking about.

VERONICA

I know exactly what the hell you're

talking about and you're right, you

don't know what the hell you're

talking about. Let's just grow up,

be adults, and die.

J.D.

Good plan.

VERONICA

But before that, I'd like to see

Heather Chandler puke her guts out.

MRS. CHANDLER

We are leaving soon for your

grandmother's. If you care to join us...

HEATHER CHANDLER

Bag that.

MRS. CHANDLER

Is that a "No" in your lingo?

HEATHER CHANDLER

Lingo this.

VERONICA

(quietly)

Trust me. She skips the Saturday

morning trip to Grandma's even

when she's not hungover.

J.D.

Then let's just concoct ourselves a

little hangover cure that'll induce

her to spew red, white, and blue.

VERONICA

What about orange juice and milk?

What's the upchuck factor on that?

J.D.

I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.

VERONICA

Don't be a dick. That stuff'll

kill her.

VERONICA

O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put

it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it

be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?

J.D.

Man Veronica, pull the plug on that

shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

VERONICA

What are you

doing

? You just

can't go.....Besides, she'd never

drink anything that looks like that.

J.D.

Okay we'll use this. She won't be

able to tell what she's drinking.

VERONICA

Just give me a cup, jerk.

VERONICA

Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe

we could cough a phlegm globber in

it or something.

J.D.

Yeah, great.

VERONICA

No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll

do quite nicely. Quite nicely.

J.D.

Chick-en.

VERONICA

You're not funny.

J.D.

I'm sorry.

VERONICA

Bonehead.

VERONICA

Morning, Heather.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle

surprise. Hear about Veronica's

affection for regurgitation?

VERONICA

We both said a lot of things we

didn't mean, last night.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?

J.D.

Veronica knew you'd have a hangover.

So I whipped this up. Family recipe.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Did you put a phlegm globber in it

or something? I'm not drinking that piss.

J.D.

I knew this stuff would be too intense.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink

it just because you call me

chicken

.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Just give me the cup, jerk.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Corn nuts!

J.D.

Something tells me you picked up

the wrong cup.

VERONICA

No shit, sherlock. I can't believe

it. I just killed my best friend.

J.D.

And your worst enemy.

VERONICA

Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

J.D.

What are we going to tell the cops?

"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

VERONICA

Stop kidding around. I'm going to

have to send my S.A.T. scores to

San Quentin instead of Stanford.

J.D.

I'm just a little freaked, all right?

(a beat)

You got what you wanted, you know.

VERONICA

It's one thing to want somebody out

of your life. It's another thing to

serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

The Bell Jar

plus a magazine proclaiming

J.D.

We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime.

But if this was like a suicide thing.....

VERONICA

Like a suicide thing?

J.D.

Adolescence is a period of life

fraught with anxiety and confusion.

VERONICA

(calming down)

I can do Heather's handwriting as

well as my own.

VERONICA

"You might think what I've done is

shocking..."

J.D.

"To me though, suicide is the

natural answer to the myriad

of problems life has given me."

VERONICA

That's good, but Heather would

never use the word "myriad."

J.D.

This is the last thing she'll ever

write. She'll want to cash in on as

many fifty-cent words as poss.

VERONICA

She missed "myriad" on a vocab

test two weeks ago, all right?

J.D.

That only proves my point more. The word

is a badge for her failures at school.

VERONICA

You're probably right..."People think

just because you're beautiful and

popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody

understood I had feelings too."

J.D.

"I die knowing no one knew the real me."

VERONICA

That's good. Have you done this before?

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Any other Principal would take the same

position. Keep things business as usual.

COUNSELOR HYDE

Heather Chandler's not your everyday

suicide. She was

very

popular.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

I let the kids go before lunch and

the switchboard'll light up like a

Christmas Tree.

KEVIN STAPLES

The parents will be sympathetic, sir.

These are troubled times for the young.

MRS. POPE

I must say I was impressed to see

that she made proper use of the word

"myriad" in her suicide note after

brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.

PAULINE

(dramatically cutting in)

I find it profoundly disturbing that

we are told of a tragic destruction

of youth and all we can talk about

is adequate mourning times and

misused vocabulary words.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Oh Christ.

PAULINE

The school, meaning both students

and teachers, must revel in this

revealing moment. I suggest we get

everyone into the cafeteria and

just talk. And feel. Together.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me

when the shuttle lands...Now is

this Heather the cheerleader?

COUNSELOR HYDE

That would be Heather Mcnamara.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Damn. I'd be willing to go half a

day for a cheerleader.

KEVIN STAPLES

Let's just pack it in an hour early.

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Done. I hate Mondays.

PAULINE

I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget

it! Just sit down. I'm just so

thrilled

to be given an example of everything

I've taught you. That example is

Heather Chandler. I have the note!

MALE STUDENT

All right!

PAULINE

I'll pass the suicide note around

the room so you can feel its tragic

beauty for yourself. Let us share

together the feelings the suicide has

spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?

FEMALE STUDENT

I heard it was really gnarly. She

drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and

stuff then she smashed....

PAULINE

Now, now, we're not here to rehash

the coroner's report. Let's talk

emotions

.

THE ALL-OUT NERD

Are we going to be tested on this?

PETER

Heather and I used to go together,

but she said I was boring. I realize

now I wasn't really boring. She was

just dissatisfied with her life.

PAULINE

That's very good Peter.

PAULINE

Dear Veronica, Heather was your

soulmate.....Share.

VERONICA

Heather was cool, but cruel. The good

looks and bad manners gave her power,

but it could not give her happiness.

VERONICA

She realized the only way she could

be happy was to give up her power and

the only way she could do that was death.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so

unfair

! We should get a whole week

off not just an hour.

HEATHER DUKE

Write the School Board.

VERONICA

Watch it, Heather. You could actually

be digesting food.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Yeah, where's your urge to purge?

HEATHER DUKE

(belching)

Fuck it.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Look, heather left behind one of her

Swatches. She'd want you to have it,

Veronica. She always said you couldn't

accessorize for shit.

FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET

I'm sorry about your friend. I thought

she was your usual airhead bitch.

Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were.

HEATHER DUKE

What a waste.

HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)

Oh the Humanity.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Veronica, what are you doing?

SQUEALING GIRL

Everyone in the shower!

MATT

Do I deliver or do I deliver?

RODNEY

Hurry up, we're going to get caught.

MATT

Mellow out Geek. Man, I never

should have brought you.

CLYDE

Let's see some pus

sy

!

MATT

Does this have something to do with

menstrual cramps and shit?

CLYDE

(dazed)

What the fuck?

RODNEY

We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I

can feel it.

CLYDE

What the fuck?

STEVE

Do you deliver or do you deliver?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

That was seriously warped, Veronica.

VERONICA

Uh-huh.

HEATHER DUKE

T.V. cameras!

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!

HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)

I choose to remember the good times.

Like when we got our ears pierced

at the mall.

HEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.)

I can still hear those late night

talks on the phone.

PETER (T.V.)

The day I won her that stuffed rhino

at the 4-H Fair, she said to me....

VERONICA (O.S.)

You're an asshole! Mute him!

J.D.

Mute!

VERONICA

Next channel, darling.

VERONICA (O.S.)

Heather, how many networks did

you run to!

VERONICA

Oh, I have to hear this.

COURTNEY (T.V.)

In my heart, Heather's still alive.

VERONICA

(muting Courtney)

What are you talking about? She

hated you! You hated her!

(to J.D.)

What are you smiling at?

J.D.

Heather Chandler is more popular

than ever now.

VERONICA

Yeah. Scary stuff.

J.D.

Why son, I didn't hear you come in.

FRED DEAN

Hey Dad, how was work today?

The Brady Bunch

sputters on the T.V. screen before him.

FRED DEAN

It was miserable. Some damn tribe of

withered old bitches doesn't want us

to terminate that fleabag hotel. All

because Glenn Miller and his band once

took a shit there. It's just like

Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?

J.D.

That was the one with the wheat right?

BIG BUD DEAN

The Save the Memorial Oak Tree

Society. Showed those fucks.

J.D.

Thirty Fourth of July fireworks

attached to the trunk. Arraigned

but Acquitted.

FRED DEAN

Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost

forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

J.D.

Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica.

VERONICA

Hello.

J.D.

Jason, why don't you ask your

little friend to stay for dinner.

VERONICA

(awkwardly standing)

My Mom's making my favorite meal

tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

J.D.

Nice. The last time I saw my Mom,

she was waving out the window of a

library in Texas. Right,

Dad

?

BIG BUD DEAD

Right,

son

.

VERONICA

(weakly)

Right.

DAD

Take a break Veronica, sit down.

VERONICA

All right.

DAD

So what was the first day after

Heather's suicide like?

VERONICA

I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

MOM

Terrible thing. So will we get to

meet this dark horse prom contender?

VERONICA

May

be

.

DAD

(looking at his cigarette)

Goddamn. Will somebody please tell

me why I smoke these damn things?

VERONICA

(smiling)

Because you're an idiot.

DAD

Oh yeah, that's it.

MOM

(shaking her head)

You two....

VERONICA

Greate pate, but I'm going to have

to motor if I want to be ready for

the funeral tomorrow.

FATHER RIPPER (O.S.)

I blame not Heather but rather a

society that tells its youth that

the answers are on the MTV video

games. We must pray the other

teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio, know

the name of that "righteous dude"

who can solve their problems....

FATHER RIPPER

(cont'd)

It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

BETTY (V.O.)

May Heather Chandler rest in peace

even though she committed suicide.

For-the-kingdom-the-power-and-the-

glory-are-yours-now-and-forever-Amen.

HEATHER MCNAMARA (V.O.)

Oh God, this is a tragic thing and

sometimes I have a hard time dealing

with it and stuff. Please send Heather

to heaven and all that. Thanks. I

mean, Amen.

PETER (V.O.)

Dear God, make sure this never

happens to me. I do not think I

could handle suicide and that's

the God's honest truth. Pardon

the pun. Fast-early-acceptance-

into-an-Ivy-League-school-and-

please-let-it-be-Harvard. Amen.

RAM (V.O.)

Jesus God in heaven, uh, why did

you kill such hot snatch. That's

a joke, man. People are so serious.

(a beat)

Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,

pray for us sinners....so we don't

get caught. Another joke, man.

HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)

I prayed for the death of Heather

Chandler many times and I felt bad

every time I did, but I kept doing

it anyway. Now I know you understood

everything. Praise Jesus. Alleluia.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Hi. I'm sorry. Technically I didn't

kill Heather Chandler but hey, who

am I trying to kid, right? I just

want my high school to be a nice

place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Veronica. What are you doing tonight?

VERONICA

Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Ram asked me out, but he wants to

double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't

have a date.

VERONICA

Hea

ther

, I've got something

going with J.D.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on

hold tonight, I'll never forget it.

KURT

We on tonight man?

RAM

I still got to talk to Heather,

dude. Weird funeral, huh?

KURT

Pretty weird.

KURT

That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

RAM

Let's kick his ass.

KURT

Cool off, we're seniors.

RAM

Goddamn Geek!

BRACES

(awkwardly defiant)

Sit and spin.

KURT

That little prick.

KURT

All right you piece of shit fag,

do you like to suck big dicks?

BRACES

Cut it out!

KURT

Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.

RODNEY

Leave him alone, Kurt.

RAM (O.S.)

Say it!

BRACES

Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.

BRACES

I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-

mm

!

I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?

KURT

I'm sure your friends are happy

to hear that.

(with a lisp)

Right,

guys

?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet

lately, consoling me and stuff.

It'll be really very. Promise.

VERONICA

All

right

, but I hope it isn't

going to be one of those nights where

they get shitfaced and take us to a

pasture to tip cows.

KURT

Is it sleeping, dude?

RAM

I think so, man.

KURT

Then get over on my side. Oh shit,

cowtipping is the fucking greatest.

RAM

Punch it in!

KURT

Count of three, guy.

KURT AND RAM

One. Two. Three!

KURT

"When I get that feeling, I need

sexual healing....."

VERONICA

Yeah, right, asshole.

J.D.

What is this shit?

VERONICA

I'm doing a favor for Heather. A

double date. I tried to tell you

at the funeral but you rode off.

KURT

(still face down)

"Feel like making bah da dah bah da

dah, feel like making love."

J.D.

Another fucking Heather.

(harshly laughs)

I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior

tonight. Seven high schools in seven

states and the only thing different

was my locker combination. We've broke

through the peer pressure cooker. So

what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..

VERONICA

So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!

J.D.

Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

KURT

"And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."

DENNIS

I'm not belittling the Famine Fund

Peter, but we're talking teen suicide!

Westerburg finally got one and I'm

not going to blow it.

PETER

Great. Heather gets the headline and I

get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

VERONICA

Hi Guys. I came to check on this

week's lunchtime poll topic.

DENNIS

Don't worry about it, Veronica,

sit down. That funeral yesterday

must have been really rough.

VERONICA

Oh. Sure.

YEARBOOK GIRL

We were, uh, wondering if maybe you

had some poems or artwork that

Heather did that we could put in

the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

VERONICA

The what?

YEARBOOK GIRL

Take a look. We'll have a two page

layout with her suicide note up

here in the right hand corner.

DENNIS

It's more tasteful than it sounds.

VERONICA

I don't know. This thing leaves a

bad taste in my mouth.

COURTNEY

Like last night, Veronica?

VERONICA

I'm sorry? I don't get it.

COURTNEY

You did last night.

COURTNEY'S FRIEND

Kurt told us of your little date.

VERONICA

Yeah. And? I left him drunk and

flailing in cowshit.

COURTNEY

I don't know. He was really detailed.

PETER

Shut up, Courtney.

VERONICA

Don't shut up. I'd like to know just

what I did.

PETER

(gesturing to the door)

Let me show you that lunchtime

poll topic, Veronica.

PETER

I

rarely

listen to Neanderthals like

Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were

bent over like a coffee table with

Kurt going in one end and Ram coming

in the other. Pardon the pun.

VERONICA

(dazed)

Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-

bitch

.

VERONICA

Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund.

VERONICA

Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I

didn't expect to be calling either. I

guess my emotions took over. I was

wondering if you wanted all those

things you've been saying to really

happen. It's always been a fantasy of

mine to have two guys at once......

Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.

VERONICA

That's right, tonight. In the woods

behind the school. Don't forget Ram.

KURT

Women.

VERONICA

I don't get the point of me writing

a suicide note when we'll just be

shooting them with blanks.

J.D.

Get crucial. We won't be using

blanks this time.

VERONICA

You can't be serious? Hey listen,

my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.

J.D.

Do you take German?

VERONICA

French.

J.D.

These are Ich Luge bullets. My

grandfather snared a shitload of

them in W.W. Two. They're like

tranquilizers only they break the

surface of the skin, enough to

cause blood, but not any real harm.

VERONICA

So it looks like the person's been

shot and killed when they're really

just unconscious and bleeding.

J.D.

We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look

like they shot each other. By the time

Kurt and Ram regain consciousness,

they'll be the laughingstock's of the

school. The note's the punchline.

How'd it turn out?

VERONICA

First tell me this similarity is

not incredible.

J.D.

(warmly)

Incredible similarity.

VERONICA

Ram and I died the day we realized

we could never reveal our forbidden

love to an uncaring and ununderstanding

world. The joy we shared in each other's

arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet

we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-

Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.

J.D.

Exquisite, but I don't think

ununderstanding is a word.

VERONICA

We don't want to make them out to be

too secretly eloquent. Why would the

Germans invent a bullet that doesn't

kill people? I mean it

was

World War

Two, not a school play.

J.D.

(rapid-fire)

They used them on themselves to

make it look like they were dead.

Really quite a brilliant device, but

too flamboyant to seriously produce.

VERONICA

Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.

J.D.

It doesn't work on small animals!

VERONICA

Oh.

J.D.

Uh well hey, let's take a look at the

homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now,

prepare to be a little disappointed.

J.D.

We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a

Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.

VERONICA

You must have had fun.

J.D.

You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot.

The one perfecto thing I picked up...

J.D.

Perrier water!

VERONICA

Oh come

on

. Lots of people drink

Perrier. It's come a long way.

J.D.

This is Ohio. If you don't have a

brewsky in your hand after dark you

might as well be wearing a dress.

VERONICA

(mock-seductively)

Oh, you're so smart. How about a

little heterosexuality before we go?

RAM

(singing)

Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever

need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello

Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...

KURT

Shut the fuck up, all right.

RAM

Lighten up, dude. In those woods is

some of the finest pussy in the school

and we don't even have to buy it a

hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!

KURT

Hi Veronica.

VERONICA

(forced cheerfulness)

Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.

RAM

So do we just start fucking?

VERONICA

I've made a circle on each end of

the clearing. Ram, you come over here.

VERONICA

When you get in the circle, strip.

RAM

What about you?

VERONICA

I was hoping you'd rip my clothes

off me, sport.

RAM

Oh. Good idea.

VERONICA

Count of three, guys.

VERONICA

One.

VERONICA

Two.

J.D.

Three.

VERONICA

Shucks.

J.D.

Did you miss him completely?

VERONICA

(giggling)

Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth

it just to see the look on....

J.D.

Don't move! I'll get him back!

J.D.

Now!

MILNER

I heard it that time!

McCORD

Wha?

MILNER

Another gunshot! From the woods!

McCORD

Shit, let's roll.

VERONICA

Kurt doesn't look too good.

J.D.

Remember he's left-handed.

MILNER (O.S.)

Keep going until you hit the clearing!

McCORD

Mother of Shit!

MILNER

Call in!

MILNER

I heard something out there. I'm

checking it out.

McCORD

This is Officer McCord and I've got

two dead bodies in the woods behind

Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of

them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.

J.D.

Faster!

McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)

Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?

MILNER

Think what I heard was just a

stinking owl. All I got is two kids

making out in the backseat of a

car. Should I pry them apart?

McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)

Forget it. I got all the answers

back here, partner.

MILNER

What's the deal?

McCORD

Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot

each other.

MILNER

That's Kurt Kelly!

McCORD

Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

MILNER

Oh my God, suicide? Why?

McCORD

Does this answer your question?

MILNER

Oh man, they were

fags

!

McCORD

Listen up, "We could never reveal our

forbidden love to an uncaring and

ununderstanding world."

MILNER

Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade

magazine Honorable Mention...

MILNER

Wait a second. How did they shoot

each other if we heard two separate

sets of gunshots?

McCORD

Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm

high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't

try to analyze it. The quarterback

buggering the linebacker. What a waste.

MILNER

Oh the humanity.

KEVIN STAPLES

(sotto voce to Counselor Hyde)

After every touchdown or whatever,

they give each other a little slap

on the bottom. It seems innocent...

PAULINE (O.S.)

Shut up.

MRS. POPE

Look at this. "Ununderstanding."

PAULINE

Will you shut up! We were in a

similar position Monday and I

thoughtfully suggested that we get

the students together for an

unadulterated emotional outpouring.

You took the suggestion as an

opportunity to play yet another round

of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."

COUNSELOR HYDE

Pauline, if you want a tryout

for the school play....

PRINCIPAL GOWAN

Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of

bullshit--angel dust, switchblades,

sexually perverse photography

exhibits involving tennis racquets,

but this suicide thing....I guess

it's all on Pauline's wavelength.

We're just going to write off today,

and Friday she can do her little

little love-in or whatever. Whatever.

VERONICA

We killed them, didn't we?

J.D.

Of course.

VERONICA

Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!

J.D.

You believed it because you wanted

to believe it. Your true feelings were

too gross and icky for you to face.

VERONICA

I did not want them

dead

.

J.D.

Did to.

VERONICA

Did not.

J.D.

Did to.

VERONICA

Did not.

HEATHER DUKE

Ah, young love.

SQUEELING GIRL

Did you hear? School's cancelled

today because Kurt and Ram killed

themselves in a repressed

homosexual suicide pact.

HEATHER DUKE

(incredulous, but amused)

No way!

J.D.

Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt

and Ram had nothing to offer the school

but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.

VERONICA

(looking to her burnt hand)

Sure. Can we make an ice run

before the funeral?

MR. KELLY

If there's any way you can hear me,

Kurt buddy, I don't care that you

really were some pansy. You're my

flesh-and-blood. You made me proud.

I love my homosexual son. My son's

gay and I love him!

VERONICA

Your son's dead and you love him.

J.D.

How do you think Mr. Kelly would

react to a son with a limp wrist

with a pulse?

MOM

How was the funeral?

VERONICA

(deadpan)

Superb.

WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)

It looks like the teen suicide

epidemic has hit home in Sherwood

as the death toll at Westerburg

High rockets to three.

WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)

Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and

Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good

looks and popularity, but there's

one thing they didn't have: Values,

Ambition, and Hope.

VERONICA

That's three things.

WHITNEY JAMES (T.V.)

It rained everyday of my Maui

vacation, but hey, I didn't kill

myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.

ANCHORMAN (T.V.)

Thanks Whitney, but I hate to say

it. It looks like you brought that

rainy weather back with you.

Tomorrow's forecast calls for...

VERONICA

No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of

wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine

show on Channel 16. Really? On the

suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit

has a body count.

VERONICA (V.O.)

The most popular people in the school

are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a

good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather

depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I

gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing

but what really frightens me is that

I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do

next. It's God versus my boyfriend

and God's losing....

PAULINE

Peter, kill the jukebox.

PAULINE

Could I have your attention?

PAULINE

Our school has been torn apart by

tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it

back together through love! I want

everyone to clasp hands. We need to

connect this cafeteria into one mighty

circuit. Let's begin a new happiness!

PAULINE

Yo, what's the problem? I know you

know how to hold hands. Ring-around-

the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it!

I'm just so thrilled to announce that

Whitney James of WETC News is taping a

rap session with students from area

high schools

including Westerburg

.

PAULINE

Let's show the world Westerburg is a

diverse happy home, not Suicide Central!

(shrewdly)

You know there's some people who say

Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a

school to be on T.V. Is that true?

PAULINE

No or Hell No?

STUDENTS

(louder)

Hell no!

PAULINE

I can't hear you....

STUDENTS

HELL NO!

VERONICA

Can't you see this is a special moment?

J.D.

I was just making it more special.

PAULINE (O.S.)

Veronica, there you are!

PAULINE

You people are in charge of getting

delegates from every clique in the

school to be on the Whitney James

Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special.

Let's be able to say we were the ones

who put peer pressure out to pasture.

PETER

Westerburg? A happy family?

PAULINE

I'm sure you'll work something out.

HEATHER DUKE

(wickedly)

Don't worry. We'll work something out.

VERONICA

Yes. Yes. We'll work something out.

I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

J.D.

Greetings and salutations.

VERONICA

You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms.

Fleming wants to redefine the high

school experience.

J.D.

She wants to ignore the high school

experience. Our way's better. We

scare people into not being assholes.

VERONICA

Don't

even

talk about that stuff!

J.D.

You mean the time you blew Kurt

Kelly's ass away!

VERONICA

You can be so immature!

J.D.

(looking off)

You kids are making too much damn noise.

FRED DEAN

We beat the bitches.

VERONICA

(mumbling)

Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.

FRED DEAN

Judge told em to slurp shit and die.

FRED DEAN

I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.

Masterful. When that blew, it set off

a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.

FRED DEAN

It's great to be alive!

VERONICA

Do you like your father?

J.D.

Never given the matter much thought.

Liked my mother.

J.D.

They said her death was an accident.

But she knew when the explosives were

set to go off. She knew...

VERONICA

Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming

has given us a chance to atone for...

J.D.

Our sins? What sins? If you put a

Nazi in a concentration camp, does

that make you a Nazi?

VERONICA

May

be

.

J.D.

Whoa! Amazing!

BIGFUN (T.V.)

TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW!

PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW!

J.D.

It's the new BigFun video!

BIGFUN (V.O.)

BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO!

BIGFUN

TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

J.D.

We've made MTV.

VERONICA

We're breaking up. I am out!

J.D.

Wha-at? Come on, there's another

T.V. in the kitchen. You know

you used to have a sense of humor.

VERONICA

You're getting too cool for me, J.D.

I don't know how to talk to you.

J.D.

Our relationship's moving fast, I know,

but I have real, real respect for you.

VERONICA

I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline

thing work. Lines of communication

between the cliques. You were a phase....

J.D.

Phase my ass! You'll be

back

! I'm

storming Normandy beaches and you're

running in place with Pauline Fonda's

airhead peacenik exercise program.

Have to stay tough! You'll be back.

HEATHER DUKE

What the.....

HEATHER DUKE

(trying to stay clam)

Where did you get these?

J.D.

Oh, I just had the

nicest

chat with

Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's

scary how everyone's got a story to

tell....Would you care to see the

canoeing shots?

HEATHER DUKE

What do you want from me?

J.D.

Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy

togetherness, it needs a leader.

Heather Chandler was that leader but...

HEATHER DUKE

But she couldn't handle it.

J.D.

I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye

Holden says his ideal job'd be making

sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.

He doesn't realize if you pay too much

attention to the kids, you'll back off

the cliff yourself.

HEATHER DUKE

Very very. The photographs?

J.D.

Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a

favor. You'll get the negatives and

everything back then.

J.D.

In the meantime, strength, And hey,

there's a little gift.

EARL

Let me get it clear, Veronica. You

want yourself a sweet homeboy for

this T.V. show so you can show

everybody what a loose, Martin Luther

Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.

VERONICA

(chuckling)

Something like that. Will you do it?

EARL

Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.

VERONICA

I just want to show different kinds

of people can get together and it

doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't

get treated badly here do you?

EARL

I don't get treated at all, but hey,

don't worry about it. I'll do your

thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.

VERONICA

Things are going to change, Earl.

EARL

Uh-huh.

HEATHER DUKE

Guess who?

VERONICA

Heather.

VERONICA

Ouch. Your machine's got the most

obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.

VERONICA (O.S./machine)

I'm just calling to say you can

wear your hair any way you want to.

DAVID

Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on

anybody's carpet lately?

VERONICA

Is this David? Heather's David?

What are you doing....

DAVID

What can I say? I was pretty broken

up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed

somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.

VERONICA

I'm delirious for the both of you.

Can you put Heather on?

DAVID

She can't really talk right now.

VERONICA

Hello, Betty.....

BETTY

I don't believe it. I'm winning.

VERONICA

Don't get cocky, girl.

BETTY

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as

exciting as your other friends.

VERONICA

That's bullshit. Just shoot.

BETTY

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.

VERONICA

(warmly)

Shoot.

VERONICA

Betty, your daydreams are a lot

better than my realities, believe

me. I'm afraid though it's time to

get your butt kicked.

BETTY

Ronnie!

BETTY

Hey, you're not settling for the two

shots are you? Knock me out girl.

It's the only way.

VERONICA

It's not my style, okay?

BETTY

Nice guys finish last. I should know.

HEATHER DUKE

Brav-

o

!

BETTY FINN

(nervously)

I've got to get going, Veronica.

See you at the studio.

VERONICA

Sure. See ya.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Croquet won't be the same without Heather.

HEATHER DUKE

Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The

Whitney James Teenage Suicide

Prevention T.V. Special isn't going

to be taped at the studios. It's

going to be done in the Park.

BETTY

But I thought...

HEATHER DUKE

(heading back)

It's going to be like a big picnic.

Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Shit.

VERONICA

So did you call people to tell them

how to get to the studio tonight?

HEATHER DUKE

Back off. I called everyone, even that

Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone

a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!

VERONICA

You're so polluted. Talking down to

people, making fake notes....

HEATHER DUKE

I don't see what gives you the right

to lecture,

Ronnie

. You were

soulmates with Betty Finn until you

realized you're the cover of

Seventeen magazine and she's the

before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.

HEATHER DUKE

Some people just don't matter. Why

should those who do carry their

weight? Am I right?

VERONICA

No, you're wrong. It's not even

your turn.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

She's right.....Boy, croquet's not

the same without Heather.

VERONICA

Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.

PETER DAWSON

Veronica, I thought we lost you.

VERONICA

I was waiting for my friend Betty.

PETER DAWSON

Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it be

pretentious of me to attach a videocassette

of the show on my Princeton application?

VERONICA

Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete.

PETER DAWSON

This is excellent, but I thought we

were going to get equal representation

on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads...

HEATHER DUKE

They're probably just being

fashionably late.

HEATHER DUKE

Is this very or what? Oh, you've

gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!

HEATHER DUKE

Whitney, here's my friend.....

WHITNEY JAMES

Ah please sit down.

WHITNEY JAMES

I got a confession to make. My name

used to be Heather, too.

VERONICA

But my name's not...

WHITNEY JAMES

People just don't take the name Heather

seriously. They should, shouldn't they?

VERONICA

I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there

were going to be different kinds of social

and psychological types at this gathering.

WHITNEY JAMES

Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather.

The minute you try to deal with the actual

teenagers who have contemplated suicide

you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand

filled with bad complexions, bad grades,

bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of

doody nobody wants to hear let alone

bend down to clean up.

WHITNEY JAMES

I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's

exciting stuff. My personal faves

are those kids from loaded families

grabbing the mike to whine how even

though they bagged a B.M.W. on their

birthday, they're still quote-unquote

depressed. It's ridiculous. People who

say money can't buy happiness don't

know where to shop.

CLYDE

What the fuck?

VERONICA

The world wants winners, I guess.

Not people stained with loserness.

WHITNEY JAMES

Stained with loserness. Oh, I like

it. Can I use that. It'd be

dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

VERONICA

It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll

excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.

WHITNEY JAMES

Sure. Ciao.

PAULINE

Everyone take their places on the stage!

(to Veronica)

Isn't this thrilling?!

VERONICA

But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.

PAULINE

What, the wine? I realize you're all

under 21, but it seemed like such a

perfect touch.

(shouting upward)

Could we get some more light up here?

PAULINE

Our schools have been torn apart by

tragedy. Let's fuse them back together

through

love

. Let's clasp hands and

connect ourselves in one mighty circuit

like a

dove

.

PAULINE (O.S.)

Let's begin a new happiness...

PAULINE

...with no more suicide...

STUDENTS

(eeriely)

Oh yeah...

J.D.

Holy traumatic experiences, Batman.

I'm sorry you felt you had to put

yourself through all that shit. I

told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in

the past already, right?

PAULINE

No more problems....

VERONICA

Oh yeah.

J.D.

Cute.

WHITNEY JAMES

Let's go for another take.

CASHIER

Bargain matinees are for the first

show only.

MARTHA

Oh, I forgot.

DAD

Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage

Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?

VERONICA

Color me educated. I learned high

school happiness is for members only,

Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality

if it lived in her uterus, and reality's

name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a

major creep.

MOM

I don't know

what

you're talking

about, honey, but can it wait a bit.

We're watching this special program

on Teen Problems.

DAN RATHER VOICE (O.S.)

Oh sure, I'll bet even back when I

went to school there were drugs, even

sex, but they were simpler times. The

Sherwood suicides tell the bitter

truth of today's young. What a waste...Oh

MOM

Turn that back on!

VERONICA

This condescending junk makes suicide

seem like a cool thing to do. Hey

kids, make your parents and teachers

feel like shit! Get the respect in

death you'll never get in life.

DAD

If we're not going to watch that

program, can I put on the game?

MOM

Are you trying to tell me it is

not

a troubled time for the nation's youth?

VERONICA

Everybody cares for youth but nobody

cares about Joey Blow. When that news

reporter gets home he'll scream at his

son for not mowing the lawn in the

right pattern.

MOM

I'm lost. You don't get enough

attention, you get too much attention.

Which is it? Where are your shoes?

VERONICA

All we want is to be treated like

human beings, not like guinea pigs

to be experimented on and not like

bunny rabbits to be patronized.

DAD

I don't patronize bunny rabbits.

MOM

Treated like human beings? Is that

what you said little Miss Voice of

a Generation? Just how do you think

adults act with other adults? You

think it's all just Doubles Tennis.

Adults can be horrible to other adults.

When teenagers complain that they

want to be treated like human beings,

it's usually because they

are

being

treated like human beings.

VERONICA

I guess I picked the wrong time to

be a human being.

MOM

You'll live. Want some pate?

HEATHER DUKE

Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica,

you missed it! Pauline and Whitney

James were up there doing there

suicide rap when the cops come in

and announce that Martha Dumptruck

tried to buy the farm. She gave

the ticket girl at the Colfax

theatre a suicide note then

bellyflopped in front of a car.

VERONICA

(repulsed)

Is she dead?

HEATHER DUKE

That's the punchline. She's still

alive, in stable condition. Another

case of a geek trying to imitate the

popular people of the school and

failing miserably. Is that pate?

VERONICA

I said I was sorry.

HEATHER DUKE

You are out of control. Heather and

Kurt were a shock, but Martha

Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed

suicide hotlines in her diapers.

VERONICA

You're not funny. Ouch!

HEATHER DUKE

(Heather Chandleresque)

What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha

couldn't take the heat so she got

out of the kitchen. Just think

what a better place the world would

be if every nimrod followed her cue.

VERONICA

Just shut up and turn on the radio.

Hot Probs is on.

HEATHER DUKE

Oh shit, yeah.

TROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio)

I know it's supposed to be funny

that they never get off the island,

but still, sometimes I feel like

I'm

on that island and Gilligan can be just

so

stupid

sometimes.

HEATHER DUKE

This sounds like a good one.

D.J.

Dude, you've got to remember if it

wasn't for the courage of the fearless

crew, the Minnow would be lost. The

Minnow would be lost! Next call!

TROUBLED MALE VOICE

But Skipper hates me....

D.J.

Whoa, they're coming out early tonight.

What ever happened to teen pregnancy

and acne? You've got the Dogcatcher on

W etcetera and you're listening to Hot

Probs. Who am I talking to?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that.

D.J. (radio)

Hey babe, I need a name?

HEATHER MCNAMARA (box)

My name is Minnie.

D.J.

Ah, Minnie. Don't tell me, Mickey

just confessed he got A.I.D.S. from

Goofy at a New Year's Eve Party.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

God has cursed me, I think. The

last time I had sex, the guy killed

himself the next day. I'm failing Math.

HEATHER DUKE                 HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio)

Holy shit, that's            My whole life is a mess.

Heather! We'll               I was supposed to be

crucify her!                 captain of the cheerleading

team, but I probably won't

VERONICA                because I miss practice when

Oh man, she knows we         my Dad visits. My parents

listen to this show!         are divorced and stuff and....

VERONICA (V.O.)

Heather told everyone about Heather.

VERONICA (V.O.)

Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather

Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head

has sprouted in its place like some

mythological thing my eighth grade

boyfriend would know about. Heather's

even doing the old note trick.

VERONICA (V.O.)

I did it J.D.'s way. I did it

Pauline's way. Nothing's changed.

I guess that's Heather's way. And

jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get

him out of my head. Are we going

to the Prom? Or to Hell? And

where's Heather going?

GRUFF TEACHER

Where's Heather going?

HEATHER DUKE

She's going to

cry-y-y

.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Fucking child protector caps.

GRUFF TEACHER

Now where's she going? Is somebody getting

raped today on All My Children or what?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Give me a break.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

What are you trying to do? Kill me?

VERONICA

What were

you

trying to do? Sleep?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Suicide is a private thing.

VERONICA

You're giving your life away to

become a goddamn statistic in U.S.

Fucking A Today. That's got to be

the least private thing I can think of.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?

VERONICA

If everyone jumped off a bridge,

young lady, would you?

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Probably....

VERONICA

Hey now, if you were happy every day

of your life, you wouldn't be a human

being, you'd be a game show host.

HEATHER MCNAMARA

Let's knock off early. Go to the mall.

Something lame like that.

VERONICA

Sure.

J.D.

So it's come to this.

(turning to the viewer)

Heather Chandler did polls. I want

you to do a Petition, as a favor, as

the

favor. Do you know the group Big Fun?

the

HEATHER DUKE

TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

J.D.

(post-chortle)

Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants

to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's

if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

HEATHER DUKE

I'll get right on it coach. And hey,

a little gift. I won't be needing it.

COURTNEY

Oh great. Here comes Heather.

COURTNEY'S FRIEND

Shit.

VERONICA (O.S.)

Heather?

HEATHER DUKE

Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've

gotten

everyone

to sign this petition

even the one who think BigFun are

tuneless Eurofags. People love me!

(giggling)

My God, you haven't signed!

VERONICA

People love you but I know you.

Jennifer Forbes told me the petition

she signed was to put a jacuzzi in

the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

HEATHER DUKE

(verbally winking)

So some people need different kinds

of "convincing" than others....

(happiness evaporating)

Hey, just sign the petition!

VERONICA

Don't talk to me like that.

HEATHER DUKE

It was J.D.'s idea! He made

out the signature sheet and

everything. Now will you sign it?

VERONICA

(queasy)

No.

HEATHER DUKE

Jealous much?

VERONICA

Heather, why can't you just be a

friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?

HEATHER DUKE

Because I can be! The same fucking cheek,

goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick?

Do you think, do you really think, if

Betty Finn's fairy godmother made

her

Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with

her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

J.D. (O.S.)

Wanna go out tonight?

J.D.

Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?

VERONICA

(jokingly but caustically)

I was thinking more along the lines

of slitting Heather Duke's wrists

open and making it look like a suicide.

J.D.

I could be up for that. I've already

started underlining

meaningful

passages

in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye,

if you know what I mean. So are we on?

VERONICA

It's over, J.D.  Over!

J.D.

I don't get it! You were wrong! I was

right! Strength, damnit! Come back!

VERONICA

Yes?

MOM

Your friend Jason Dean just stopped

by. He seemed very concerned about

you. He said he thinks you might

try to kill yourself.

DAD

You

have

been depressed lately. Oh,

he said this is for you.

VERONICA

Oh my God....

MOM (O.S.)

He says we should keep you away from

sharp objects, closed garages, toxic...

J.D. (O.S.)

"You can't ever find a place nice

and peaceful because there isn't any."

J.D.

Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-

I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-

so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give

it a try, underline something.

VERONICA

Get off my bed, you sick psycho!

You think you're a rebel! You're

not a rebel! You're a sick psycho!

Do you think you're a rebel? Do you

think you're a rebel? I wanna know!

J.D.

"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's

call the whole thing off...Hold it!

J.D.

Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I

love it. I usually go for whole

sentences myself, but hey this is

perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...

VERONICA

Wait a....You're not listening! I'm

not on your side....

VERONICA

You're still not listening! I'm not..

J.D.

(pulling out the knife)

Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.

VERONICA

(taking the knife from him)

This knife is filthy.

J.D.

What in the hell do you think I'm

doing? Taking out her tonsils?

VERONICA

I think I know Heather a bit better

than you, okay? If she was going to

slash her wrists, the knife would

be absolutely spotless.

J.D.

How's this? Can you see your

fucking reflection?

VERONICA

Tomorrow someone else will move

into her place. That person

could be me.

(suddenly deliriously defiant)

Ha, there's only one of us who knows

Heather's handwriting and if you think

I'm doing another suicide note.

J.D.

(laughing)

You don't get it, do you? Society

nods its head at any horror the

American teenager can think to

bring upon itself. We don't need

gloves and does anyone really

care about exact handwriting?

J.D.

Perfecto. Man, I've even got a

marked-up Catcher in the Rye.

What else does a suicide need?

J.D.

(raising the knife)

If you'll excuse me......

VERONICA

No-o!

FATHER RIPPER

Eskimo.

the

copy of The Catcher in the Rye.

FATHER RIPPER

Heather Duke underlined a lot of

things in this copy of The Catcher

in the Rye, but I believe the word

Eskimo, underlined all by itself is

the key to understanding Heather's pain.

FATHER RIPPER

On the surface, Heather Duke was the

vivacious young lady we all knew her

to be. But her soul was in Antartica,

freezing with the knowledge of the way

fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way

parents can be unresponsive, and as she

writes so eloquently in her suicide note,

the way life can suck. We'll all miss

Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope

she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

CHANDLER

moves next to VERONICA holding a plate

HEATHER CHANDLER

Is this turnout weak or what? I had

at least

seventy more people at

my funeral.

VERONICA

Heather? Wha...

HEATHER CHANDLER

Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is

s-o-o boring. If I have to sing

"Kumbaya" one more time...

VERONICA

What are you doing here?!

HEATHER CHANDLER

I made your favorite. Spaghetti.

Lots of oregano.

HEATHER CHANDLER

Dinner!

MOM (O.S.)

Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!

VERONICA (O.S.)

Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not

the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A.

That is to say, no one but me. I know

where J.D. is coming from and where

he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going

to teach him what's right. I'm going

to stop J.D....If it's the last thing

I do.

MOM

Does she want a written invitation?

(yelling upward)

Veronica! Dinner!

MOM

Honey?

J.D.

I can't believe you did it. I was

teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed

up here to kill you, but first I was

going to try and get you back. With

amazing petition.

J.D.

It's a shame you can't see what our

fellow students really signed.

J.D.

Listen. "We students of Westerburg

High will die. Today. Our burning

bodies will be the ultimate protest

to a society that degrades is. Fuck

you all." Not that subtle but neither's

blowing up the school. Talk about your

suicide pacts. When our school explodes

tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of

thing that infects a generation. A

Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we

coulda toasted marshmallows together.

MOM (O.S.)

Honey, are you all right in there?

MOM

Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my

baby back! I should have let you keep

that job at the mall. I was just afraid

of you coming home alone at night!

MOM

I made your favorite! Spaghetti!

Lots of oregano!

VERONICA

Hey Mom, why so tense?

FRED DEAN (O.S.)

I need some help with my homework...

J.D.

Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....

PAULINE

Veronica! J.D. told me you

committed suicide last night!

VERONICA

Where is he? Where's J.D.?

PAULINE

We have to talk.  Whether to kill

yourself is one of the most important

decisions a teenager has to make.

VERONICA

Get a job.

VERONICA

Rodney, where's everybody going?

RODNEY

It's Friday.....

VERONICA

Oh my God, the damn pep assembly....

RODNEY

Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,

but at least we all get out of class...

VERONICA

Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

RODNEY

The boiler room.

VERONICA (O.S.)

May I see your hall pass?

J.D.

I knew that loose was too noose! I

mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!

VERONICA

Like father, like son. A serious-as-

fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll

set off a pack of thermals upstairs.

Okay, so let's start by slowly putting

the bomb down on the ground.

VERONICA

Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.

Put your hands on your head.

J.D.

You didn't say Simon Says.

J.D.

Live by the sword...

J.D.

You think just because you started

this thing, you can end it?

J.D.

You, really didn't think I'd, forget,

forget, to disconnect the....

VERONICA

The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do

you turn it off? Tell me!

J.D.

Fuck you!

VERONICA

It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.

J.D.

You want to wipe the slate clean as

much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am

killing everyone in the school

because nobody loves me. You have a

purpose though! Remember? Let's face

it, the only place different social

types can genuinely get along with

each other is in heaven.

VERONICA

How do you turn the fucker off?

J.D.

You're not listening. People are

going to look at the ashes of

Westerburg and say there's a school

that self-destructed not because

society didn't care, but because

that school

was

society. Is that

deep or what? I'll let you put it in

your diary, babe. Free of charge.

VERONICA

The bomb, asshole!

J.D.

Just push the red button twice.

That's what stops it. If that's

what you want, babe?

VERONICA

You know what I want, babe?

J.D.

What?

VERONICA

Cool guys like you out of my life.

VERONICA

But babe, don't worry, these here

were Ich Luge bullets.

J.D. (O.S.)

Color me impressed.

J.D.

You really fucked me up, Veronica.

VERONICA

(vertigo city)

I thought I...you..

J.D.

You've got power, Veronica. Power I

didn't think you had. The slate is

clean.

J.D.

Pretend I did blow up the school. All

the schools. Now that you're dead,

what are you gonna do with your life?

VERONICA

Perfecto.

HEATHER DUKE

Veronica, you look like hell.

VERONICA

Yeah, I just got back.

HEATHER DUKE

What are you doing?

VERONICA

Heather, my love, there's a

new sheriff in town.

VERONICA

Hey, Martha, wait up.

VERONICA

My date for the prom kind of flaked

out on me, so I thought if you

weren't doing anything that night

we could go to the video store and

rent some new releases or something.

Maybe pop some popcorn.

MARTHA

I'd like that.

VERONICA

So would I.
