SHOOTING DRAFT

1939

DISSOLVE TO:

MANAGER

(politely)

Is there anything I can do for you,

monsieur?

BULJANOFF

No, no.

MANAGER

Yes, monsieur?

IRANOFF

Just looking around.

KOPALSKI

Comrades, why should we lie to each

other? It's wonderful.

IRANOFF

Let's be honest. Have we anything

like it in Russia?

ALL THREE

(agreeing with him)

No, no, no.

IRANOFF

Can you imagine what the beds would

be in a hotel like that?

KOPALSKI

They tell me when you ring once the

valet comes in; when you ring twice

you get the waiter; and do you know

what happens when you ring three

times? A maid comes in -- a French

maid.

IRANOFF

(with a gleam in his

eye)

Comrades, if we ring nine times...

let's go in.

BULJANOFF

(stopping him)

Just a minute -- just a minute -- I

have nothing against the idea but I

still say let's go back to the Hotel

Terminus. Moscow made our reservations

there, we are on an official mission,

and we have no right to change the

orders of our superior.

IRANOFF

Where is your courage, Comrade

Buljanoff?

KOPALSKI

Are you the Buljanoff who fought on

the barricades? And now you are afraid

to take a room with a bath?

BULJANOFF

(stepping back into

the taxi)

I don't want to go to Siberia.

IRANOFF

I don't want to go to the Hotel

Terminus.

KOPALSKI

If Lenin were alive he would say,

"Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in

your life you're in Paris. Don't be

a fool. Go in there and ring three

times."

IRANOFF

He wouldn't say that. What he would

say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford

to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't

the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean

anything to you? Do you want to live

in a hotel where you press for the

hot water and cold water comes and

when you press for the cold water

nothing comes out at all? Phooey,

Buljanoff!"

BULJANOFF

(weakening)

I still say our place is with the

common people, but who am I to

contradict Lenin? Let's go in.

DISSOLVE TO:

KOPALSKI

Are you the manager?

MANAGER

(eyeing the three

suspiciously)

Yes.

KOPALSKI

Pardon me for introducing Comrade

Iranoff, member of the Russian Board

of Trade.

MANAGER

(bowing with strained

politeness)

Monsieur.

IRANOFF

This is Comrade Kopalski.

MANAGER

Monsieur.

BULJANOFF

I am Comrade Buljanoff.

MANAGER

Monsieur.

BULJANOFF

May I ask how much your rooms are?

MANAGER

(trying to get rid of

them)

Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates

are rather high.

BULJANOFF

Why should you be afraid?

MANAGER

(haughtily)

I might be able to accommodate you.

Is there some more luggage?

IRANOFF

Oh, yes, but have you a safe here

big enough to hold this?

MANAGER

I'm afraid we have no boxes of that

size in our vault, but there is one

suite with a private safe...

IRANOFF

That's even better.

MANAGER

But, gentlemen, I am afraid...

BULJANOFF

He's always afraid.

MANAGER

(a little annoyed)

I just wanted to explain. The

apartment may suit your convenience

but I doubt that it will fit your

convictions. It's the Royal Suite.

BULJANOFF

Royal Suite!

(To the manager)

Just a minute.

BULJANOFF

(in a low voice)

Now Comrades, I warn you... if it

gets out in Moscow that we stay in

the Royal Suite we will get into

terrible trouble.

IRANOFF

(defending his right

to a good time)

We'll just say we had to take it on

account of the safe. That's a perfect

excuse. There was no other safe big

enough.

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF

That's right. Good, very good.

BULJANOFF

Of course, we could take out the

pieces and distribute them in three

or four boxes in the vault and take

a small room. That's an idea, isn't

it?

IRANOFF

Yes, it's an idea, but who says we

have to have an idea?

BOTH

That's right... that's right.

BULJANOFF

(turning to the Manager)

Give us the Royal Suite.

DISSOLVE TO:

KOPALSKI'S VOICE

Will you connect me with Mercier...

yes, the jeweler...

KOPALSKI

I want to speak with Monsieur Mercier

personally... Hello, Monsieur Mercier?

This is Kopalski of the Russian Board

of Trade. We arrived this morning...

Thank you.

KOPALSKI'S VOICE

Yes, everything is here. The necklace

too. All fourteen pieces... What?

No, Monsieur Mercier, the court jewels

of the Duchess Swana consisted of

fourteen pieces. Why don't you check

on that? Naturally, we have all the

necessary credentials.

DISSOLVE TO:

WIPE TO:

RAKONIN

(to taxi driver)

Eight Rue de Chalon.

WIPE TO:

MAID

Good morning, Count.

LEON

Good morning.

MAID

Her Highness is still dressing.

LEON

(as he walks toward

Swana's door)

That's all right.

SWANA

Hello, Leon!

LEON

Good morning, Swana.

SWANA

It's really a wretched morning...

wretched. I can't get myself right.

I wanted to look mellow and I look

brittle. My face doesn't compose

well... all highlights... how can I

dim myself down, Leon? Suggest

something. I am so bored with this

face. I wish I had someone else's

face. Whose face would you have if

you had your choice? Oh, well, I

guess one gets the face one deserves.

LEON

Your conversation has one marvelous

advantage, Swana. However many

questions you ask you never expect

an answer.

SWANA

Don't you find that restful?... Why

didn't you come last night?

LEON

Darling, I was busy looking out for

your interests.

SWANA

Did you win?

LEON

(enthusiastically)

We can forget horse racing, roulette,

the stock market... our worries are

over! You remember that platinum

watch with the diamond numbers? You

will be in a position to give it to

me.

SWANA

(with humor)

Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.

(She kisses him)

LEON

We can be rich if you say the word.

I had dinner with the Guizots last

night.

SWANA

(contemptuously)

Those newspaper people?

LEON

You'd be surprised how many nice

people dine with the Guizots.

SWANA

What a gruesome proof of the power

of the press!

LEON

Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur

Guizot the idea of publishing your

memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne.

"The Life and Loves of the Grand

Duchess Swana of Russia"!

SWANA

(protestingly)

Oh, Leon!

LEON

Sweetheart, we won't have to bother

about our future if you are willing

to raffle off your past!

SWANA

Was it for this that I refused to

endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I

could have made a little fortune by

saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner

was the only vacuum cleaner ever

used by the Romanoffs... and now you

want them to smear my life's secrets

over the front page of a tabloid?

LEON

I understand how you feel, but there

is a limit to everything, particularly

pride and dignity. They are willing

to pay any price! They have a

circulation of two million!

SWANA

Imagine two million clerks and shop

girls peeking into my life for a

sou! Think of my lovely life being

wrapped around cheese and blood

sausages! I can see a big grease

spot in the midst of my most intimate

moments!

LEON

Well, I am the last person to persuade

you, but don't do it blindly... if

this is your decision, you must be

prepared to face the consequences...

(With the expression

of a man ready to

give his all)

I will have to go to work.

SWANA

My little Volga boatman! Stop

threatening! I don't deserve this.

(Embracing him)

Are you my little Volga boatman?

LEON

Now, Swana...

SWANA

First tell me, are you my little

Volga boatman?

LEON

(anything to stop her)

Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

SWANA

(walking back to the

dressing table)

Well... two million readers... I

know exactly what they want. Chapter

One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars.

Lovely Little Princess Plays with

Rasputin's Beard."

LEON

I've got one chapter Guizot thinks

is terrific. "Caviar and Blood."

Swana escapes over the ice!

SWANA

A couple of bloodhounds and we have

Uncle Tom's Cabin.

LEON

(thinking of another

idea)

Darling, this would be wonderful!

Just once... weren't you attacked by

a Bolshevik?

SWANA

(straining her memory)

Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!

LEON

Too bad! Brings our price down ten

thousand francs!

SWANA

Come in.

MAID

Count Rakonin asks the privilege of

a few words, Your Highness.

LEON

Count Rakonin?

SWANA

He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor

devil. You know him.

LEON

Oh, yes.

SWANA

Tell him I won't be able to see him

for a half an hour.

MAID

The Count says if it could be as

soon as possible. It is luncheon

time and he is just between courses.

RAKONIN

Your Highness.

SWANA

How do you do, my friend.

RAKONIN

Your Highness, forgive this intrusion,

but...

SWANA

What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose

your job?

RAKONIN

No, madame, something of the utmost

importance... it concerns your jewels.

SWANA

My jewels?!

RAKONIN

I remember one birthday of His

Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had

the honor of being on guard at the

summer palace... I still see you

bending before His Majesty... You

wore your diadem and a necklace...

your face seemed to be lighted by

the jewels.

SWANA

(puzzled)

Why do you bring this up after so

many years?

RAKONIN

They are here!... Your jewels!...

Here in Paris!

SWANA

Alexis! Do you know what you are

saying?

RAKONIN

This morning three Soviet agents

arrived. I overheard a telephone

conversation with Mercier, the

jeweler. Your Highness, they are

going to sell them!

LEON

Did I hear something about jewels?

SWANA

Rakonin, bless him, has given me the

most amazing news!

SWANA

(into phone)

Balzac 2769...

(to Leon)

My lawyer...

RAKONIN

I am sorry... I have to leave.

SWANA

(to Rakonin)

Thank you so much, my friend. I will

get in touch with you.

SWANA

(into phone)

This is the Duchess Swana... I want

to speak to Monsieur Cornillon...

it's very important... please get

him right away... Hello, Monsieur

Cornillon? The most incredible thing

has happened! My jewels are here in

Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are

trying to sell them! Yes... yes...

we must act immediately!... Call the

police... Have them arrested!...

Well, then, get an injunction!...

But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!

(apparently the answer

is some objection

from Cornillon)

...But they are my jewels! There

must be some way of getting them

back!

LEON

(just as nervous as

Swana)

What does he say?

SWANA

(to Leon)

Shhh!

(into phone)

...But how can there be a question?...

Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All

right, I'll let you know!

LEON

What did he say?

SWANA

(discouraged)

It looks pretty hopeless... there

may be a chance... that's all... The

French Government has recognized

Soviet Russia and he doubts that

they will risk a war for my poor

sake. He might be able to make up

some kind of a case but it would

cost money, money, money!... That's

all they are interested in -- those

lawyers!

LEON

(taking her in his

arms)

Darling, calm down. Why do you need

a lawyer? Haven't you your little

Volga boatman?

DISSOLVE TO:

MERCIER

Very good... superb... excellent...

it would be foolish to belittle the

quality of the merchandise but your

terms are impossible. My counteroffer

is the absolute maximum.

KOPALSKI

But, Monsieur Mercier...

MERCIER

(continuing)

Gentlemen, I'll let you in on a little

secret... we are only undertaking

this deal for the prestige involved,

and, quite frankly, we are expecting

to take a loss.

IRANOFF

(whispering)

Capitalistic methods...

BULJANOFF

They accumulate millions by taking

loss after loss.

BULJANOFF

(answering phone)

Hello... this is Buljanoff, Iranoff,

and Kopalski... Who?... Count

d'Algout?... No, no... it must be a

mistake... we can't be disturbed.

MERCIER

(continuing)

I assure you no one else could meet

the figure named by my syndicate...

at least under the present economic

conditions.

KOPALSKI

We can wait.

IRANOFF

(pompously)

Do we give the impression of people

who are pressed for money?

MERCIER

Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards

face down. Right now there is a

Russian commission in New York trying

to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is

another in London mortgaging the oil

fields in Baku. You need money and

you need it quickly. I think my offer

is fair and does not even take

advantage of your situation.

KOPALSKI

(to Mercier)

Just a minute.

IRANOFF

(in a low voice)

He's cutting our throat...

BULJANOFF

But what can we do?... We have to

accept.

KOPALSKI

Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give

in so quickly. After all we have to

uphold the prestige of Russia.

BULJANOFF

All right, let's uphold it for another

ten minutes.

IRANOFF

We don't want to be disturbed.

LEON

My name is Count d'Algout. I

telephoned.

IRANOFF

If you want to see us you must come

later.

LEON

I just want a word with Monsieur

Mercier.

IRANOFF

But you can't...

LEON

Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce

myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I

think I had the pleasure of meeting

you in your beautiful shop. I was

admiring a platinum watch with diamond

numbers.

MERCIER

Oh, yes, yes...

LEON

(glancing at the jewels)

Glorious, aren't they?

KOPALSKI

Now, monsieur, you have no right...

LEON

(very charmingly)

Just a moment.

(to Mercier)

I hope you haven't closed this deal,

Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you

into serious difficulties.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Who are you? What do you want? What

is this?

LEON

These jewels are the property of the

Duchess Swana of Russia, and were

seized illegally by the Soviet

Government. I am acting for Her

Highness, the Duchess. Here is my

power of attorney.

IRANOFF

(excitedly)

You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is

all non-sense.

KOPALSKI

These may have been the jewels of

the Duchess Swana, but, like all

private property, they were

confiscated by the State.

LEON

We'll leave the problem of their

ownership to the French courts.

Meanwhile I have filed a petition

for an injunction to prohibit you

from either selling or removing the

jewels. Here is a copy.

LEON

I thought it my duty to warn you. I

would hate to see you get in any

trouble, monsieur.

MERCIER

Thank you.

(he turns to the

Russians)

Gentlemen, this introduces a new

element into our negotiations. Until

this claim is completely settled...

KOPALSKI

We can call our ambassador.

IRANOFF

I give you my word! They were

confiscated legally!

MERCIER

Please try to understand my position.

I am not with-drawing. My offer stands

and as soon as you produce a clear

title, approved by the French courts,

the deal is settled. Until then,

good day.

LEON

(intimately)

I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur

Mercier.

MERCIER

(in a low voice)

On the contrary. I consider myself

very lucky. Good day.

LEON

(bowing)

Good day, monsieur.

LEON

(jauntily)

Well, gentlemen... how about a little

lunch?

IRANOFF

Get out of here!

LEON

Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All

is not lost. You may have a chance.

KOPALSKI

(bursting forth)

We may have a chance.

LEON

Yes... a very slim one. I want to be

fair. I don't deny that you might

make out some kind of a case.

KOPALSKI

We haven't anything to discuss with

you. We'll talk to a lawyer!

LEON

All right -- go ahead... you talk to

the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!

IRANOFF

That won't help you! You can't

intimidate us!

KOPALSKI

Soviet Russia will put all its might

behind this case.

BULJANOFF

You think because you represent the

former Duchess...

LEON

The Duchess...

BULJANOFF

The former Duchess!

LEON

In any case, gentlemen, a charming,

beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn

you, if this case comes to trial it

will be before a French court, and

when the Duchess takes the stand...

IRANOFF

All right, go ahead, get her on the

witness stand! What can she say?

LEON

But how will she look? The fashions

this spring are very becoming to

her. Gentlemen, the judge will be

French, the jury will be French,

everybody in that courtroom will be

French. Have you ever seen a French

court when a beautiful woman sits on

the witness stand and lifts her skirt

a little? You sit down and pull up

your pants and where will it get

you?

IRANOFF

I suppose you expect us to hand over

the jewels?

LEON

Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman,

I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying

to do is make things as difficult as

possible.

BULJANOFF

Not that we are giving in one inch,

but tell us... what is in your mind?

LEON

Well, gentlemen, how about my

proposition?

IRANOFF

What proposition?

LEON

I just said let's have a little lunch.

(picking up the

telephone)

Room service.

DISSOLVE TO:

LEON

Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha!

KOPALSKI

Yes, Leon...

IRANOFF

(pawing him)

What is it, my boy?

LEON

About this telegram to Moscow. Why

should you bother? I'll write it for

you.

BULJANOFF

Leon... Leonitchka...

(he embraces Leon)

Why are you so good to us?

(he kisses Leon)

IRANOFF

(kissing Leon too)

Leon, my little boy.

KOPALSKI

(joining them)

Oh, Leon, you are so good.

LEON

(freeing himself as

best he can)

What's the name of that Commissar on

the Board of Trade?

IRANOFF

Razinin.

LEON

(writing)

Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.

KOPALSKI

You wouldn't like Razinin.

BULJANOFF

He's a bad man. Sends people to

Siberia!

IRANOFF

We don't like Razinin.

BULJANOFF

(again pawing Leon)

We like you, Leon -- don't we like

Leon?

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI

Yes, we like Leon... little

Leonitchka.

LEON

How does this strike you? Commissar

Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.

Unexpected situation here. Duchess

Swana in Paris claims jewels, and

has already brought injunction against

sale or removal. After long and

careful study we suggest in the

interest of our beloved country a

fifty-fifty settlement as best

solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and

Kopalski.

KOPALSKI

If we say that, Leon... we'll be

sent to Siberia!

IRANOFF

And if we have to go to Siberia...

LEON

(still looking over

the telegram)

I'll send you a muff.

BULJANOFF

Oh, why are you so good to us?

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI

Yes, you are so good, Leon.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Comrade waiter, dear waiteritchka!...

Why are you so good to us? You good

waiter!

LEON

Take this telegram to the telegraph

office at once!

RAKONIN

Yes, monsieur.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT:

LADY LAVENHAM

Good afternoon, messieurs, mes

Comrades.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Good afternoon, Lady Lavenham.

KOPALSKI

And how is Lord Lavenham?

BULJANOFF

...and little Lady Beatrice?

LADY LAVENHAM

Very well. Did fortune favor you at

the races?

IRANOFF

Comme ci, comme ca.

LADY LAVENHAM

I understand... nothing to write

home about.

BULJANOFF

(alarmed)

Who wants to write home about it?

LADY LAVENHAM

It's just a saying. How about joining

us Saturday night for dinner? We're

having a few friends.

KOPALSKI

Are we free, Buljanoff?

BULJANOFF

Possibly.

IRANOFF

We'll manage.

LADY LAVENHAM

Then let's say at nine.

BULJANOFF

Black tie or white tie?

LADY LAVENHAM

Oh, let's make it white.

BULJANOFF

Certainly!

LADY LAVENHAM

Au revoir.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Au revoir.

BULJANOFF

Nice people.

IRANOFF

(into telephone)

Yes, Leon...

(a little bit annoyed)

What is it, Leon?... You can't hurry

such things... You must give Moscow

a little time... There's nothing we

can do about it... why don't you

drop in later?... Au revoir...

BULJANOFF

Misha! Misha!

IRANOFF

What is it?

BULJANOFF

A telegram from Moscow! It must have

been here all day!

KOPALSKI

(joining them and

reading telegram)

Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy

extraordinary arrives Thursday six

ten with full power. Your authority

cancelled herewith. Razinin.

IRANOFF

It is Thursday!

BULJANOFF

It's six o'clock already!

KOPALSKI

I always said it would be Siberia!

DISSOLVE TO:

IRANOFF

(to Manager)

A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow.

He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move

our things to the smallest room you've

got.

MANAGER

Yes, monsieur.

IRANOFF

Right away... instantly!

BULJANOFF AND KOPALSKI

Iranoff!

IRANOFF

I'm coming!

DISSOLVE TO:

IRANOFF

This is a fine thing. Maybe we've

missed him already.

KOPALSKI

How can you find somebody without

knowing what he looks like?

IRANOFF

That must be the one!

BULJANOFF

Yes, he looks like a comrade!

BEARDED MAN AND GIRL

Heil Hitler!

KOPALSKI

No, that's not him...

BULJANOFF

Positively not!

NINOTCHKA

(to Iranoff)

I am looking for Michael Simonovitch

Iranoff.

IRANOFF

I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.

NINOTCHKA

I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy

Extraordinary, acting under direct

orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin.

Present me to your colleagues.

IRANOFF

Comrade Buljanoff...

NINOTCHKA

Comrade.

IRANOFF

Comrade Kopalski...

NINOTCHKA

Comrade.

IRANOFF

What a charming idea for Moscow to

surprise us with a lady comrade.

KOPALSKI

If we had known we would have greeted

you with flowers.

NINOTCHKA

(sternly)

Don't make an issue of my womanhood.

We are here for work... all of us.

Let's not waste time. Shall we go?

IRANOFF

Porter!

PORTER

Here, please...

NINOTCHKA

What do you want?

PORTER

May I have your bags, madame?

NINOTCHKA

Why?

KOPALSKI

He is a porter. He wants to carry

them.

NINOTCHKA

(to Porter)

Why?... Why should you carry other

people's bags?

PORTER

Well... that's my business, madame.

NINOTCHKA

That's no business... that's a social

injustice.

PORTER

That depends on the tip.

KOPALSKI

(trying to take

Ninotchka's bags)

Allow me, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

No, thank you.

BULJANOFF

How are things in Moscow?

NINOTCHKA

Very good. The last mass trials were

a great success. There are going to

be fewer but better Russians.

DISSOLVE TO:

NINOTCHKA

What's that?

KOPALSKI

It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

NINOTCHKA

Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a

civilization survive which permits

women to put things like that on

their heads. It won't be long now,

Comrades.

DISSOLVE TO:

BULJANOFF

This is the apartment we have reserved

for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope

you like it.

NINOTCHKA

(glancing around the

tremendous room)

Which part of the room is mine?

IRANOFF

You see... it is a little different

here. They don't rent rooms in pieces.

We had to take the whole suite.

NINOTCHKA

How much does this cost?

IRANOFF

Two thousand francs.

NINOTCHKA

A week?

IRANOFF

A day.

NINOTCHKA

Do you know how much a cow costs,

Comrade Iranoff?

IRANOFF

A cow?

NINOTCHKA

Two thousand francs. If I stay here

a week I will cost the Russian people

seven cows.

(with an outburst of

emotion)

Who am I to cost the Russian people

seven cows?

BULJANOFF

We had to take it on account of the

safe.

IRANOFF

For ourselves... we are much happier

now since we moved to a little room

next to the servants' quarters.

NINOTCHKA

I am ashamed to put the picture of

Lenin in a room like this.

(she puts the

photograph on the

desk)

Comrades, your telegram was received

with great disfavor in Moscow.

KOPALSKI

We did our best, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

I hope so for your sake.

(she sits at her desk

and starts to type

her report)

Let us examine the case. What does

the lawyer say?

BULJANOFF

Which lawyer?

NINOTCHKA

You didn't get legal advice?

BULJANOFF

We didn't want to get mixed up with

lawyers. They are very expensive

here. If you just say hello to a

lawyer... well, there goes another

cow.

KOPALSKI

We dealt directly with the

representative of the Grand Duchess.

I am sure if we call him he will

give you a very clear picture.

NINOTCHKA

I will not repeat your mistake. I

will have no dealings with the Grand

Duchess nor her representative.

NINOTCHKA

(looking up)

Comrade Buljanoff...

BULJANOFF

Yes, Comrade?

NINOTCHKA

Do you spell Buljanoff with one or

two f's?

BULJANOFF

(with fright in his

voice)

With two f's, if you please.

NINOTCHKA

(into phone)

Will you send me some cigarettes,

please?

(suddenly getting up)

Comrades, I am not in a position to

pass final judgment but at best you

have been careless in your duty to

the State.

(with utmost gravity)

You were entrusted with more than a

mere sale of jewelry. Why are we

peddling our precious possessions to

the world at this time? Our next

year's crop is in danger and you

know it. Unless we can get foreign

currency to buy tractors there will

not be enough bread for our people.

And you three comrades...

KOPALSKI

We did it with the best intentions...

NINOTCHKA

We cannot feed the Russian people on

your intentions. Fifty per cent to a

so-called Duchess!... Half of every

loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade

Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy

and get the address of the best lawyer

in Paris.

KOPALSKI

Yes, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public

Library and get me the section of

the Civil Code on property.

BULJANOFF

Is there anything I can do, Comrade?

NINOTCHKA

You might get me an accurate map of

Paris. I want to use my spare time

to inspect the public utilities and

make a study of all outstanding

technical achievements in the city.

BULJANOFF

Yes, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

Come in.

CIGARETTE GIRLS

(gaily)

Hello! Hello! Cigarettes?

NINOTCHKA

(looking at the

Russians)

Comrades, you seem to have been

smoking a lot.

FADE OUT:

DESK CLERK

Desk... yes, Monsieur Kopalski...

(he writes down the

message)

...you are expecting Count d'Algout...

uh huh... but he is not to go to the

Royal Suite under any circumstances.

He should go to your new room, 985?

Thank you, monsieur.

(he hangs up the

receiver)

DESK CLERK

Good evening, madame.

NINOTCHKA

Good evening. She exits out the door.

DISSOLVE TO:

NINOTCHKA

You, please.

LEON

Me?

NINOTCHKA

Yes. Could you give me some

information?

LEON

Gladly.

NINOTCHKA

How long do we have to wait here?

LEON

Well -- until the policeman whistles

again.

NINOTCHKA

At what intervals does he whistle?

LEON

What?

NINOTCHKA

How many minutes between the first

and second whistle?

LEON

That's funny. It's interesting. I

never gave it a thought before.

NINOTCHKA

Have you never been caught in a

similar situation?

LEON

Have I? Do you know when I come to

think about it it's staggering. If I

add it all up I must have spent years

waiting for signals. Imagine! An

important part of my life wasted

between whistles.

NINOTCHKA

In other words you don't know.

LEON

No.

NINOTCHKA

Thank you.

LEON

You're welcome.

LEON

Can I help you?

NINOTCHKA

You might hold this for me.

LEON

Love to.

NINOTCHKA

(engrossed in her

geography)

Correct me if I am wrong... We are

facing north, aren't we?

LEON

(bewildered)

Facing north... I'd hate to commit

myself without my compass... Pardon

me... are you an explorer?

NINOTCHKA

No... I am looking for the Eiffel

Tower.

LEON

Is that thing lost again?... Listen...

if you are interested in a view...

NINOTCHKA

I am interested in the Eiffel Tower

from a technical standpoint.

LEON

Technical... I couldn't help you

from that angle. You see, a real

Parisian only goes to the top of the

tower in moments of despair to jump

off.

NINOTCHKA

How long does it take a man to land?

LEON

Now, isn't that too bad! The last

time I jumped I forgot to clock it!

(looks at map)

Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your

finger, please.

NINOTCHKA

(skeptically)

Why do you need my finger?

LEON

Bad manners to point with your own...

Here... the Eiffel Tower.

NINOTCHKA

And where are we?

LEON

(shifting her finger

back to the hotel)

Here... here we are... here you are

and here I am... feel it?

NINOTCHKA

I am interested only in the shortest

distance between these two points.

Must you flirt?

LEON

I don't have to but I find it natural.

NINOTCHKA

Suppress it.

LEON

I'll try.

NINOTCHKA

For my own information would you

call your approach toward me typical

of the local morale?

LEON

Madame, it is that kind of approach

which has made Paris what it is.

NINOTCHKA

You are very sure of yourself, aren't

you?

LEON

Nothing has occurred recently to

shake my confidence.

NINOTCHKA

I have heard of the arrogant male in

capitalistic society. It is having a

superior earning power that makes

you like that.

LEON

A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade...

I have been fascinated by your Five-

Year Plan for the past fifteen years!

NINOTCHKA

Your type will soon be extinct.

DISSOLVE TO:

NINOTCHKA

Please... can you tell me the exact

width of the foundation on which the

piers are resting?... and the depth?

ATTENDANT

You don't have to worry. The thing

is safe.

NINOTCHKA

I am not afraid... I want to know...

LEON

(reading)

The foundation is one hundred and

forty-one yards square...

(he tips his hat and

interjects)

I hope you'll forgive me but I thought

you'd...

NINOTCHKA

(interrupting)

Go ahead.

LEON

(continuing)

Four massive piers of masonry are

sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on

the side of the Seine, and twenty-

nine and one-half feet on the other

side. The girders of interlaced iron-

work which stay the structure have

an inclination of fifty-four

degrees...

NINOTCHKA

That's a strange angle.

LEON

Yes, very strange.

LEON

(continuing to read)

Ascending to the tower is a staircase

consisting of eight hundred and twenty-

nine steps...

(this disclosure

frightens Leon as he

realizes the climb

ahead of him. He

reads on as they

walk up)

...and an additional two hundred and

fifty-four steps to the very top...

(now Leon stops but

Ninotchka proceeds

on out of the picture.

Leon calls after her

and reads from his

book in a loud voice)

There is an elevator included in the

price of admission!

DISSOLVE TO:

NINOTCHKA

You gave me some very valuable

information. Thank you.

LEON

(looking at the

dazzling view)

And thank you for getting me up here.

I've never seen this before.

Beautiful, isn't it?

NINOTCHKA

Yes, it is.

LEON

I'm glad I saw it before becoming

extinct.

NINOTCHKA

Do not misunderstand me. I do not

hold your frivolity against you.

(she looks him up and

down)

As basic material you might not be

bad, but you are the unfortunate

product of a doomed culture. I feel

sorry for you.

LEON

You must admit that this doomed old

civilization sparkles... It glitters!

NINOTCHKA

I do not deny its beauty, but it is

a waste of electricity.

LEON

What a city! There are the Grands

Boulevards... blasted out of the

heart of the old streets. The Arc de

Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's

army. The Opera! And Montmartre...

Montparnasse... La Boheme... and now

I'll show you the greatest attraction!

(he steps to a

telescope and, taking

some money from his

pocket, drops a coin

in the slot)

It will cost me a franc but it is

worth it.

(he adjusts the

telescope)

The most wonderful spot in all Paris --

unique! Here, look....

(she looks in telescope)

What do you see?

NINOTCHKA

I see a house that looks like any

other house. What's remarkable about

it?

LEON

It's not the structure but the spirit

which dwells within. There are three

rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to

hospitality.

NINOTCHKA

So that is your house?

LEON

Well, let's say I live in it. Such a

pleasant place... all kinds of

comfort, easy to reach, close to

street car, bus, and subway...

NINOTCHKA

(straight from the

shoulder)

Does that mean that you want me to

go there?

LEON

(feeling that he has

offended her)

Please don't misunderstand me...

NINOTCHKA

Then you don't want me to go there.

LEON

(in a pickle)

Now I didn't say that either...

naturally nothing would please me

more.

NINOTCHKA

(simply)

Then why don't we go?

(looking at him)

You might be an interesting subject

of study.

LEON

I will do my best.

DISSOLVE TO:

GASTON

(into phone)

No... Count d'Algout is still out.

Yes, as soon as he returns I'll tell

him. Yes... I'll tell him Monsieur

Buljanoff.

LEON

Good evening, Gaston.

GASTON

Good evening, Monsieur.

NINOTCHKA

Is this what you call the "butler"?

LEON

Yes.

NINOTCHKA

(takes Gaston's hand)

Good evening, comrade.

(to Leon)

This man is horribly old. You should

not make him work.

LEON

He takes good care of that.

NINOTCHKA

He looks sad. Do you whip him?

LEON

No, though the mere thought makes my

mouth water.

NINOTCHKA

(to the completely

flabbergasted Gaston)

The day will come when you will be

free. Go to bed, little father. We

want to be alone.

GASTON

(in a low voice)

Count d'Algout, there have been

several telephone...

LEON

Go to bed.

LEON

Well, may I offer you a drink, or

how about something to eat?

NINOTCHKA

Thank you. I've had all the calories

necessary for today.

NINOTCHKA

What do we do now?

LEON

We take off our hat and coat.

(he takes her things)

We sit down -- we make ourselves

comfortable. We adjust ourselves to

the prospect of a most enjoyable

evening. We look at each other. We

smile.

(Ninotchka doesn't

respond)

Well... we don't smile. How about

some music?

NINOTCHKA

Is that customary?

LEON

It helps. It has ever since King

David wooed Bathsheba with the harp.

As I am not so fortunate as to have

my harp at hand, I shall turn on the

radio.

NINOTCHKA

(the observer)

I should say this room is eighteen

by twenty-five.

LEON

Not too big and not too small. What

I'd call the typical room of an

average man. Or shall we say a little

above average. Now if there are any

special aspects you wish to study I

have nothing to conceal. Just look

around. That's my desk. Those are my

books, and here am I. Where shall we

begin?

NINOTCHKA

I will start with you.

LEON

That's great. I'm thirty-five years

old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh

a hundred and eighty-two pounds

stripped.

NINOTCHKA

And what is your profession?

LEON

Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind

alert, keeping my landlord appeased.

That's a full-time job.

NINOTCHKA

And what do you do for mankind?

LEON

For mankind not a thing -- for

womankind the record is not quite so

bleak.

NINOTCHKA

You are something we do not have in

Russia.

LEON

Thank you. Thank you.

NINOTCHKA

That is why I believe in the future

of my country.

LEON

I begin to believe in it myself since

I've met you. I still don't know

what to make of it. It confuses me,

it frightens me a little, but it

fascinates me, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA

You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni-

notchka.

LEON

Ni-notchka.

NINOTCHKA

That is correct.

LEON

Ninotchka, do you like me just a

little bit?

NINOTCHKA

Your general appearance is not

distasteful.

LEON

Thank you.

NINOTCHKA

Look at me. The whites of your eyes

are clear. Your cornea is excellent.

LEON

Your cornea is terrific. Tell me --

you're so expert on things -- can it

be that I'm falling in love with

you?

NINOTCHKA

You are bringing in wrong values.

Love is a romantic designation for a

most ordinary biological, or shall

we say chemical, process. A lot of

nonsense is talked and written about

it.

LEON

Oh, I see. What do you use instead?

NINOTCHKA

I acknowledge the existence of a

natural impulse common to all.

LEON

What can I possibly do to encourage

such an impulse in you?

NINOTCHKA

You don't have to do a thing.

Chemically we are already quite

sympathetic.

LEON

(bewildered, and yet

completely intrigued)

You're the most improbable creature

I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka,

Ninotchka...

NINOTCHKA

You repeat yourself.

LEON

I'd like to say it a thousand times.

NINOTCHKA

Don't do it, please.

LEON

I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must

forgive me if I appear a little old-

fashioned. After all, I'm just a

poor bourgeois.

NINOTCHKA

It's never too late to change. I

used to belong to the petty

bourgeoisie myself. My father and

mother wanted me to stay and work on

the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.

LEON

(bewildered)

The bayonet? Did you really?

NINOTCHKA

I was wounded before Warsaw.

LEON

Wounded? How?

NINOTCHKA

I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry

Brigade. Would you like to see my

wound?

LEON

(dumfounded)

I'd love to.

(she pulls the blouse

off her shoulder and

shows him her scar)

Tsk, tsk, tsk.

NINOTCHKA

A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.

LEON

Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA

(readjusting her blouse)

Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer.

After all, I'm alive.

LEON

What kind of a girl are you, anyway?

NINOTCHKA

Just what you see. A tiny cog in the

great wheel of evolution.

LEON

You're the most adorable cog I ever

saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska,

let me confess something. Never did

I dream I could feel like this toward

a sergeant.

LEON

Do you hear that?

NINOTCHKA

It's twelve o'clock.

LEON

It's midnight. One half of Paris is

making love to the other half. Look

at the clock. One hand has met the

other hand. They kiss. Isn't that

wonderful?

NINOTCHKA

That's the way a clock works. There's

nothing wonderful about it. You merely

feel you must put yourself in a

romantic mood to add to your

exhilaration.

LEON

I can't possibly think of a better

reason.

NINOTCHKA

It's false sentimentality.

LEON

(trying desperately

to make her mood

more romantic)

You analyze everything out of

existence. You analyze me out of

existence. I won't let you. Love is

not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka,

why do doves bill and coo? Why do

snails, coldest of all creatures,

circle interminably around each other?

Why do moths fly hundreds of miles

to find their mates? Why do flowers

open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka,

Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight

symptom of the divine passion... a

general warmth in the palms of your

hands... a strange heaviness in your

limbs... a burning of the lips that

is not thirst but a thousand times

more tantalizing, more exalting,

than thirst?

NINOTCHKA

You are very talkative.

LEON

Was that talkative?

NINOTCHKA

No, that was restful. Again.

NINOTCHKA

Thank you.

LEON

Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My

impossible, unromantic, statistical...

LEON

(continuing)

Glorious, analytical...

NINOTCHKA

The telephone is ringing.

LEON

Oh, let it ring.

NINOTCHKA

But one of your friends may be in

need of you. You must answer.

LEON

(into phone)

Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I

couldn't make it. I ran into a friend

from the army... What?... The deal

is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?...

LEON

...A special envoy arrived... What?...

That sounds better. I'll be glad to

see her any time she wants... Oh,

she doesn't want to see me? What do

you know about that? Why?... Well,

I'll get in touch with her myself.

What's her name?...

(he takes a pencil

and a piece of paper)

...What?... Yaku... How do you spell

it?... Heavens! those Russian names!

(he starts to write

it down)

...I... Oh, Y...

LEON

(continuing)

Yakushova... Ninotch...

LEON

(into phone)

All right. Thank you.

LEON

(camera panning with

him as he walks over

to her)

Ninotchka...

NINOTCHKA

I must go.

LEON

Ninotchka, or shall I say Special

Envoy Yakushova...

NINOTCHKA

Let's forget that we ever met.

LEON

I have a better suggestion. Let's

forget that the telephone ever rang.

I never heard that you are

Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my

Ninotchka...

NINOTCHKA

(firmly)

I was sent here by my country to

fight you.

LEON

All right, fight me, fight me as

much as you want, but fight me

tomorrow morning! There's nothing

sweeter than sharing a secret with a

bitter enemy.

NINOTCHKA

(uncompromisingly)

As a representative of Moscow...

LEON

Tonight let's not represent anybody

but ourselves.

NINOTCHKA

It is out of the question. If you

wish to approach me...

LEON

You know I want to...

NINOTCHKA

Then do it through my lawyer!

LEON

(desperate)

Ninotchka, you can't walk out like

this... I'm crazy about you, and I

thought I'd made an impression on

you. You liked the white of my eye.

NINOTCHKA

I must go.

LEON

But, Ninotchka, I held you in my

arms. You kissed me!

NINOTCHKA

I kissed the Polish lancer too...

before he died.

FADE OUT:

DISSOLVE TO:

GASTON

Good morning, Your Highness.

SWANA

Good morning, Gaston.

GASTON

Count d'Algout is still asleep.

SWANA

(as she walks toward

Leon's room)

That's all right.

SWANA

Leon! What in heaven's name...!

LEON

Huh?

SWANA

Is anything wrong? Are you ill?

LEON

No.

SWANA

Don't tell me the bed has lost its

best friend.

LEON

I just couldn't sleep. I got up and

went back... and then got up again.

These last few days... whew!

SWANA

Darling, you're taking my business

affairs far too seriously. Much as

I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of

their filthy money, I won't do it at

the expense of your health.

Particularly as we know we won't get

much.

(tenderly)

You look so pale... pale but

interesting.

SWANA

Come in.

GASTON

Your breakfast, monsieur.

LEON

I don't feel like any breakfast.

SWANA

Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds

and make yourself agreeable to the

Whites if you don't keep up your

strength.

GASTON

Shall I draw your bath, sir?

LEON

Make it ice cold.

SWANA

Not in your condition.

(to Gaston)

Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and

tender. And lay out his gray suit.

(to Leon)

Afterwards I'll drive you through

the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.

GASTON

A blue shirt, perhaps?

SWANA

Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a

striped one, and brighten it with a

great blaze of tie.

GASTON

Very well, Your Highness.

SWANA

Now... here we have two very handsome

soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose

hens mind what happens to their eggs?

Probably not. They have such unfeeling

eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of

butter, plenty of pepper and salt...

Darling, I haven't seen you for three

livelong days... seventy-two hours!

LEON

(irritably)

Oh, please, Swana! I don't know

whether I'm standing on my head or

my heels. Here you are blaming me

for neglecting you when I'm trying

to concentrate on another woman and

can't get near her.

SWANA

You haven't seen her yet?

LEON

No, and believe me I've tried

everything! I must have telephoned

her a hundred times. I've sent her

telegrams, I've sent her flowers...

I asked her to dinner... I offered

her seats for the Opera...

SWANA

That proletarian! In the old days

we'd have had her flogged.

LEON

That wouldn't have done any good.

Not with her.

(forgetting himself)

She's the most incredible creature

I've ever seen.

SWANA

You just told me you hadn't seen

her.

LEON

Well... er... I caught a glimpse of

her when she walked through the lobby.

SWANA

Imagine the carpets of a self-

respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by

the boots of a muzhik! What does she

look like?

LEON

You can't imagine.

SWANA

That bad?

(Leon nods)

Old or young?

LEON

Timeless. When she comes into a room

you'd think that the Bolsheviks had

taken over Paris. She wears her cheap

miserable blouse as though it were

the latest model by Schiaparelli.

What a woman! What a woman! There is

a Russian snowstorm in each of her

eyes.

SWANA

You saw all that in one glimpse?

LEON

(getting up)

Darling, if we're going to get

anywhere someone has to keep his

eyes open!

(he walks over to the

bathroom)

SWANA

Now, darling, soak in your beautiful

pine bath and let Gaston shave you.

SWANA

Gaston!

DISSOLVE TO:

THE THREE RUSSIANS

How do you do?

SWANA

Yes?

KOPALSKI

We want to talk to Count d'Algout.

My name is Kopalski.

SWANA

Oh... you are the three gentlemen

from Moscow?

KOPALSKI

Yes.

SWANA

(icily)

You may wait.

BULJANOFF

That's her.

KOPALSKI

Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening

the door for us.

BULJANOFF

Once in Petersburg I was driving

down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart

and Her Highness in her troika swept

down from the opposite direction,

and when I couldn't make way quick

enough she spat in my face.

IRANOFF

Now look here, Buljanoff. You never

were in Petersburg, you never owned

a cart, and she never spat in your

face. Who are you trying to impress?

LEON

Hello, boys.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Leon!

LEON

Come in, come in.

LEON

What's new?

KOPALSKI

(excitedly)

Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going

to negotiate! She is going to fight

that injunction. She's going to make

a precedent of it!

IRANOFF

She says she won't be intimidated by

parasites. She called the Duchess a

blood-sucking aristocrat and a

blackmailer.

LEON

(eagerly)

What did she say about me?

IRANOFF

(after a moment's

consideration)

I think she covered you with the

parasites.

BULJANOFF

And Leonitchka! What she said about

us...!

IRANOFF

And they might believe her in Moscow.

BULJANOFF

What do you mean they might -- they

will!

KOPALSKI

We don't blame you, Leon, but when

we came from Russia we believed in

simplicity...

IRANOFF

We avoided luxury and extravagance

and today... well, if you were to

offer us a glass of champagne, we

wouldn't say no.

LEON

Well, boys, I'd like to help you but

what can I do? Yesterday I waited

six hours in the lobby!

KOPALSKI

She doesn't leave her room! She has

been locked in for the last two days

with lawyers and law books!

LEON

All right, then make an appointment

with her so I can see her!

KOPALSKI

We can't... but you are so ingenious,

Leon...

IRANOFF

You found your way to us and we

weren't easy to reach, were we?

LEON

No, no.

BULJANOFF

Didn't we put up a strong resistance?

LEON

Oh, yes, yes.

KOPALSKI

You must help us, Leon... if you

don't win her over we're on our way

to Siberia!

BULJANOFF

Or it might be the firing squad!

KOPALSKI

Or we can't go back to Russia!

IRANOFF

What's wrong with that?

BULJANOFF

Yes! We could stay with Leon!

IRANOFF

Leon, how would you like to have

three lifelong friends?

LEON

Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is

your mother country. Three sons

walking out all at once... that's

too much for any mother.

BULJANOFF

Well, if your mother turns against

you, you have to look for someone to

adopt you.

SWANA

Leon! Just a minute...

SWANA

I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at

Fouquet's if you can make it, and...

Leon, remember, a man should think

it over twice before he decides to

become a mother.

FIRST LAWYER

(uncertainly)

I seem to remember some additional

injunctive provision dealing with

the property of foreigners residing

in France.

NINOTCHKA

(with the precision

of a machine)

You are referring to paragraph 59b,

section 25f of the Civil Code.

NINOTCHKA

Page eight hundred twenty-four.

NINOTCHKA

And do not fail to read the three

footnotes. While you are studying it

I will eat.

(She picks up the

telephone)

Food please.

RAKONIN

(into phone)

Room service... Just a moment please.

LEON

(with an assumed French

accent -- into phone)

Room service speaking.

NINOTCHKA

(into phone)

Send me a plate of raw carrots and

beets, beets predominating on a ratio

of sixty-forty... What? There is a

strike in the kitchen? Good! Will

you assure the strikers of my hearty

sympathy in their cause. I hope they

will not weaken in their demands and

tell them to put no dressing

whatsoever on my vegetables... What?

You won't serve me either? Now look

here, Comrade, I think it is a fine

idea to let the capitalists go without

luncheon but when you keep food away

from me you're weakening the people.

LEON

(into phone)

So! You want to make a strike breaker

out of me! I am surprised at you,

Comrade! Is it too much for the

workers of the world to ask you to

walk around the corner for lunch?

All I can say to you is take your

hammer and sickle and get out of

that Royal Suite!

DISSOLVE TO:

NINOTCHKA

Tsk, tsk, tsk.

DISSOLVE TO:

TAXI DRIVER

Where to, madame?

NINOTCHKA

Can you recommend a restaurant?

TAXI DRIVER

Well, there's Pruniers if you care

for seafood. If you want to lunch in

the Bois, there's...

NINOTCHKA

(interrupting)

Where do you eat?

TAXI DRIVER

At Pere Mathieu's.

NINOTCHKA

Where is that?

TAXI DRIVER

It's just a place for workmen.

NINOTCHKA

Where is it?

TAXI DRIVER

Eight blocks down in the Rue de

Poivrel.

NINOTCHKA

Thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

PERE MATHIEU

This way, madame. Are you alone? By

the window perhaps?

(He leads the way)

Or a nice little corner table?

NINOTCHKA

This will do.

(She sits down)

PERE MATHIEU

I think this is the first time you

have been to my little place. Your

face is new to me. Now, what shall

it be?

NINOTCHKA

Raw carrots and beets.

PERE MATHIEU

(horrified)

Oh, madame! This is a restaurant,

not a meadow.

PERE MATHIEU

Here is what we are offering today.

Please make your choice. I am sure

you will find something to tempt

your appetite.

LEON

Why, hello! It certainly is a small

world!

PERE MATHIEU

(to Ninotchka)

Well, madame? Shall we start with

soup? Fish soup today. I got up at

five to fish them from the Seine.

LEON

(calling over to Pere

Mathieu)

Crayfish soup for me!

PERE MATHIEU

(to Leon)

Very well, monsieur.

(back to Ninotchka)

Then, may I suggest an omelet with

mushrooms?

NINOTCHKA

Bring me something simple. I never

think about food.

PERE MATHIEU

(horrified)

But, madame! If you don't think about

food what do you think about?

NINOTCHKA

The future of the common people.

PERE MATHIEU

(sagely)

That also is a question of food,

madame. I'll bring you a nice little

lunch a la Pere Mathieu.

(he exits)

LEON

Pardon me for addressing you but you

insulted him, you know that. You

hurt his feelings. It was just like

telling a musician you don't like

music. That good old man believes in

food as you believe in Karl Marx.

You can't go around hurting people,

Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can

make it up to him. Do you know how?

(He changes to the

chair at his table

which is closest to

her table)

By eating everything with relish, by

drinking everything with gusto, by

having a good time for the first

time in your natural life!

NINOTCHKA

I don't like your following me.

LEON

I didn't follow you.

NINOTCHKA

Then how did you get here?

LEON

I always eat here.

NINOTCHKA

This is a place for workmen.

LEON

(laying it on thick)

But my dear child, I am most at home

among working men. I hate the places

where you circulate -- the Hotel

Clarence... This is my natural

element. After all, what are any of

us? Workingmen! At least, those of

us who are worth our salt. Hyah?

CUT BACK TO:

LEON

Hyah!

LEON

Hyah, fellows!

LEON

(boastfully)

They are all my friends. They're a

swell bunch!

LEON

(trying his bluff on

Pere Mathieu)

Ah, my friend! I'm happy to see you

again!

PERE MATHIEU

I'm always glad to meet a new

customer, and I hope this first visit

will not be your last.

LEON

Just an old man. His memory is getting

weak.

NINOTCHKA

What are you after?

LEON

Must one always be after something?

NINOTCHKA

Your tactics are useless. My name is

neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor

Kopalski.

LEON

Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk

business. If you win the suit, fine.

If we win the suit, better. You do

me an injustice.

(He moves over to her

table, leaving the

soup at his table)

When we went to my apartment did I

have the slightest idea that you had

any connection with this deal?

NINOTCHKA

But you have now, and I know now

that you are a man who employs

business methods which in Russia

would be punished by death.

LEON

Death! Death! Always so glum! What

about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians

never think of life? Of the moment

in which we are living? The only

moment we really have? Don't take it

all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing

is worth it. Please... relax... I

beg you, Sergeant... smile!

NINOTCHKA

(astonished)

What?

LEON

Will you smile?

NINOTCHKA

Why?

LEON

Just smile.

NINOTCHKA

At what?

LEON

At anything. At the whole ludicrous

spectacle of life. At people being

pompous and taking themselves

seriously and exaggerating their own

importance. If you can't find anything

else to laugh at you can laugh at

you and me.

NINOTCHKA

Why?

LEON

Because we are an odd couple.

NINOTCHKA

Then you should go back to your table.

LEON

No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not

yet. Not until I've made you laugh...

at least once.

NINOTCHKA

Ha! Ha! Now go back.

LEON

That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh

from the heart. Now let's see. I'm

going to tell you a funny story.

Just a moment... I've got it! Well,

it seems there were a couple of

Frenchmen who went to America...

NINOTCHKA

On which boat?

LEON

(thrown off by her

methodical thinking)

Well, er... let's drop it. I don't

think you would care for that one.

NINOTCHKA

Probably not.

LEON

Do you like Scotch stories?

NINOTCHKA

I have never heard one.

LEON

Two Scotchmen met on the street...

and I don't know the name of the

street and it really doesn't matter.

Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh

and the other's was McGillicuddy.

McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello,

Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy

says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr.

McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to

McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs.

McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy

says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs.

McIntosh?"...

NINOTCHKA

I wish they had never met.

LEON

(disarmed)

So do I.

(after a little pause)

Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha!

Ha!

(he looks at Ninotchka

and her expression

stops him)

Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's

forget it! How's this? Two men are

looking at the moon. One says to the

other, "Is it true that a lot of

people live on the moon?" "Yes, it

is," says the other, "five hundred

million." "Whew!" replies the first,

"they must get pretty crowded when

it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

LEON

(starting to get sore)

I suppose you don't think that's

funny?

NINOTCHKA

No.

LEON

It seemed funny to me when I first

heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't

with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

NINOTCHKA

I don't think so.

LEON

Maybe you haven't any sense of humor.

Well, I'll give you one more chance!

Now listen!

LEON

When I heard this joke for the first

time I laughed myself sick. Here

goes! A man comes into a restaurant

and sits down and says, "Waiter! Get

me a cup of coffee without cream."

After five minutes the waiter comes

back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we're

all out of cream, can it be without

milk?"

LEON

(furious)

Not funny, huh?

NINOTCHKA

No.

LEON

So you don't think that's funny? It

is funny! Everyone else thinks so!

Maybe you didn't get it.

LEON

(threateningly)

I'll tell you that joke again. A man

comes into a restaurant. Did you get

that?

NINOTCHKA

Yes.

LEON

He sits down at the table and says

to the waiter... Did you get that

too?

NINOTCHKA

Yes.

LEON

Well, so far it isn't funny, but

wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter!

Bring me a cup of coffee." So the

waiter comes back five minutes later

and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have

no coffee."...

(he realizes he has

made a mistake)

Wait a minute... wait a minute...

I'm all mixed up...

(he starts over again)

A man comes in a restaurant, he sits

down, he calls the waiter and he

says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee

without cream," and five minutes

later the waiter comes back and says,

"I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream,

can it be a glass of milk!"

LEON

Ah! You have no sense of humor! That

settles it! You have no sense of

humor! None! No humor!!

LEON

(indignantly)

What's funny about this?

FADE OUT:

LAWYER

(reading)

In addition to the arguments above

enumerated for lifting this

injunction, we wish to cite the

decision of the High Court of Paris,

rendered in the case of Princess

Marishka against the Government of

Montenegro on the fifth day of August,

1897. Comparing the facts in that

case with our present set of facts

we feel that the Treaty between the

Republic of France and the U.S.S.R.

should prevail over all...

NINOTCHKA

I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day

I heard such a funny story...

(she laughs again)

It still makes me laugh. It is very

funny.

(a little embarrassed)

I am sorry. Oh yes... about this

injunction...

LAWYER

(very businesslike)

The hearing is set for the twentieth

of this month.

NINOTCHKA

(not thinking of the

injunction)

That's two weeks from Thursday...

LAWYER

We did our utmost to have it set

ahead.

NINOTCHKA

(her attitude

completely different

from her former

business conferences)

I know, gentlemen, but it is in the

hands of the Court. We're helpless,

aren't we?

LAWYER

Yes. It is unfortunate.

NINOTCHKA

Well, there's nothing we can do about

it. Why get excited?

LAWYER

We'll leave these papers here for

your further consideration. Au revoir,

madame.

NINOTCHKA

Au revoir.

NINOTCHKA

Well, it means another two weeks in

Paris.

IRANOFF

(with exaggerated

efficiency)

Too bad we have to waste all that

time.

KOPALSKI

I acted on your suggestion and got

in touch with the Power and Light

authorities. Whenever you want to

visit their plants they are open to

you.

NINOTCHKA

(a little bit dreamily)

Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.

BULJANOFF

There's something else which I know

will appeal to you. A visit to the

Paris sewers. They tell me it is

extremely instructive.

NINOTCHKA

Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut,

Buljanoff? You all look so wintry,

Comrades. And why do we always keep

the windows closed?

(she opens the window)

Isn't it amazing, at home there's

still snow and ice and here... Look

at the birds. I always felt a little

hurt that our swallows deserted us

in the winter for capitalistic

countries. Now I know why. We have

the high ideal but they have the

climate... well, Comrades, I don't

think I need you any more.

KOPALSKI

If there is anything we can do for

you...

NINOTCHKA

No, not a thing. Would you like to

go out?

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Thank you, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

Have you any money?

NINOTCHKA

Well, here are fifty francs.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

(overwhelmed)

Thank you, Comrade, thank you.

NINOTCHKA

Bring me forty-five back.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

(terribly disappointed)

Naturally, Comrade.

DISSOLVE TO:

LEON

(consulting his watch)

What time have you, Gaston?

GASTON

Eight forty-two, sir.

LEON

I guess it is eight forty-two.

GASTON

You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.

LEON

I am, Gaston.

GASTON

If you will forgive me, ever since

you met that Bolshevik lady I've

noticed a distinct change in you,

sir.

LEON

(complacently)

Have you?

GASTON

Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly

amazed when I came from the market

and found that you had made your

bed, sir.

LEON

And Gaston, I was happier all day

long. I felt I'd contributed

something.

GASTON

Well, sir, if you should do it again,

which I hope you won't, please

remember the order. Counterpane,

blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.

LEON

Ah, there's something poetic about

the simple processes of labor.

Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet,

sheet... it should be set to music!

GASTON

May I add, sir, that it was with

great amazement that I found a copy

of Karl Marx's Capital on your night

table. That is a socialistic volume

which I refuse to so much as dust,

sir. I view with alarm, sir, the

influence over you of this Bolshevik

lady.

LEON

I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it

about time that you realized the

unfairness of your position? You

being my servant? Wouldn't you like

to stand on an equal footing with

me?

GASTON

No, sir.

LEON

Isn't there any revolt in you?

Sometimes when I order you around

don't you feel like kicking me in

the pants?

GASTON

(emphatically)

No, sir.

LEON

Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you

look forward to the day when you can

come in here and stand square on

your two feet and say, "Hey, you,

d'Algout! from now on it's going to

be share and share alike"?

GASTON

(outraged)

Emphatically not, sir. The prospect

terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand

me, sir, I don't resent your not

paying me for the past two months,

but the thought that I should split

my bank account with you... that you

should take half of my life's

savings... that is really too much

for me.

LEON

Go to bed, little father, go to bed.

NINOTCHKA

I don't look too foolish?

LEON

Foolish? If this dress were to walk

down the boulevard all by itself I

would follow it from one end of Paris

to the other, and when I caught up

with it I would say, "Just a moment,

you charming little dress, I want

you to meet Ninotchka... you two

were meant for each other." Ninotchka

feels more comfortable.

LEON

You remember this room?

NINOTCHKA

I've never been here before. I wonder

whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know,

a girl with a map, figuring out each

step, worrying about north and south.

Today... now this might shock you...

I went up to a taxi and said "Eight

Rue du Bois"... and here I am.

LEON

You see? Life can be so simple.

NINOTCHKA

For twelve francs, seventy-five.

LEON

Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence?

The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...

(charmingly)

But he got you here.

NINOTCHKA

(reprimanding him)

It's nine o'clock.

LEON

That's when one half of Paris says

to the other half, "What are your

plans for this evening, madame?"

NINOTCHKA

(getting more and

more in the spirit

of her change of

appearance)

Well, first I should like to take

off my hat and jacket.

(Leon takes them)

Then could we have some music?

LEON

A wonderful idea! Radio or records?

NINOTCHKA

Not radio. Let's have music that's

just for ourselves.

LEON

(with great feeling

and sincerity)

I'll play it softly because I have

things to tell you about which I

can't shout.

LEON

Well, my darling... I... we...

LEON

(as they come out of

the kiss)

You see I couldn't shout that.

NINOTCHKA

(with great feeling)

Leon, you know the jokes you told me

a few days ago? I wake up in the

middle of the night and laugh at

them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know

they're not funny, they're silly.

They're stupid. And still... I

laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff

and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they

are scoundrels and I should hate

them -- then I realize who made them

like that, and instead of sending my

report to Moscow I tear it up and go

down and buy a ridiculous hat... and

if this keeps on... am I too

talkative?

LEON

(radiantly)

No... go on.

NINOTCHKA

Leon, I want to tell you something

which I thought I never would say,

which I thought nobody ever should

say, because I thought it didn't

exist... and, Leon... I can't say

it...

LEON

What a gesture for a sergeant.

NINOTCHKA

Leon, I would like to ask you

something.

LEON

Anything, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA

If you don't want to answer, you

needn't. But if you do, you must

tell me the truth.

LEON

I promise... I swear.

NINOTCHKA

(seriously)

Did you make any change in this room?

LEON

I don't think so.

NINOTCHKA

When I was here before I noticed a

photograph of a woman on the desk in

a wide silver frame. I thought what

a waste of silver. That's all that

interested me then. Now I would like

to know... what happened to the woman?

NINOTCHKA

The Duchess.

NINOTCHKA

(looking at the picture)

She is very attractive. She has great

elegance.

(she looks back at

Leon)

She's what you call a woman of the

world, isn't she?

LEON

(after a little pause)

Ninotchka, I love you.

NINOTCHKA

I suppose she is very entertaining...

It must be lots of fun to be with

her, so witty, so glamorous...

LEON

Ninotchka, you're jealous.

NINOTCHKA

(with great feeling)

Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture

of myself... I couldn't bear the

thought of being shut up in a

drawer... I couldn't breathe, I

couldn't stand it.

LEON

My darling.

FADE OUT:

HEADWAITER

Good evening, Your Highness.

SWANA

Good evening, Louis. You seem to be

very crowded tonight. Can you manage

a table near the floor?

HEADWAITER

Certainly, Your Highness, this way

please... Count d'Algout made the

reservation this afternoon.

SWANA

(puzzled)

Count d'Algout...

HEADWAITER

It is only a small table but it will

be no trouble to put in some extra

chairs.

SWANA

No, that's another party.

LADY

Why don't we go some other place?

It's so crowded here.

SWANA

(delighted at her

luck)

No, no! This is glory! At last I'm

going to have a look at that female

Bolshevik. Can you give us another

table?

HEADWAITER

Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.

SWANA

That's perfect!

ANOTHER WOMAN GUEST

You mean Leon's bringing the Bolshevik

you told us about?

SWANA

Isn't it divine?

ANOTHER GUEST

I wouldn't have missed this for the

world.

SWANA

(very gay, in

anticipation of a

triumph)

Now, we must be very discreet. If

she sucks her soup and drinks out of

her finger bowl, I don't want anyone

to laugh.

(everybody in the

party giggles)

We must not embarrass little Leon.

He is going through enough for my

sake. We mustn't add insult to injury

HEADWAITER

Is this satisfactory?

SWANA

Thank you, Louis.

HEADWAITER

Is it to be dinner, monsieur?

GENERAL SAVITZKY

Possibly later. We'll just start

with champagne.

SWANA

(to the party)

I'm only afraid that the doorman may

spoil our fun. If only he lets her

in!

GENERAL SAVITZKY

Your Highness...

SWANA

Yes, General Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY

I want you to know all the White

Russian exiles in Paris are keeping

their fingers crossed about the

jewels. They are very interested in

the case. Swana suspects her

countrymen.

SWANA

Are they indeed? Thank you.

GENERAL SAVITZKY

They hope the settlement will bring

you a fortune.

SWANA

General, please... if you hear any

rumors that I am a charitable person,

will you please kill them at their

source?

GUEST

Look! There's Leon!

EVERYONE AT THE TABLE

Oh yes! Where? There! Oh! How

exciting!

MARIANNE

Isn't she something?

SWANA

Shall we dance, General Savitzky?

GUEST

Are you crazy?

ANOTHER GUEST

How could you make such a remark?

THIRD GUEST

Swana isn't stupid.

MARIANNE

What did I say? I just said "isn't

she something?" I didn't say something

what.

LEON

(to Waiter)

Is it dry?

WAITER

Yes, monsieur.

LEON

(to Ninotchka)

Is that right or do you prefer it

sweet?

NINOTCHKA

I wouldn't know. The closest I ever

came to champagne was in a newsreel.

The wife of some president was

throwing it at a battleship.

LEON

It's always good luck to launch

something with champagne; a

battleship... or an evening.

NINOTCHKA

It's funny to look back. I was brought

up on goat's milk, I had a ration of

vodka in the army, and now champagne.

LEON

(gaily)

From goats to grapes. That's drinking

in the right direction.

NINOTCHKA

Ugh... um... oh...

(slowly the delight

of champagne dawns

on her and her face

breaks into a smile)

It's good.

NINOTCHKA

From what I read I thought champagne

was a strong drink. It's very

delicate. Do people ever get drunk

on this?

LEON

There have been cases... but the

headache the next morning is worth

while -- if you drink it with the

right toast.

(he raises his glass

again fondly)

To us, Ninotchka!

SWANA

Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of

all people! How are you, my dear?

LEON

(embarrassed)

Hello, Swana. How do you do, General

Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY

How do you do?

SWANA

(to Leon)

You're looking magnificent, Leon...

(to General Savitzky)

...isn't he, General Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY

Yes.

LEON

Thank you.

SWANA

Is this your new dress suit?

LEON

Yes, Swana.

SWANA

Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson

were the tailors for you?

LEON

(patiently)

Yes, Swana, you did.

SWANA

It's a dream of beauty. He never

takes my word for anything, but I

was right, wasn't I?

LEON

Yes, Swana.

SWANA

(forcing an

introduction)

Am I interrupting?

LEON

Not at all. Your Highness, may I

present Madame Yakushova?

SWANA

How do you do?

NINOTCHKA

How do you do?

LEON

And General Savitzky.

GENERAL SAVITZKY

How do you do?

NINOTCHKA

How do you do?

SWANA

I've some wonderful news for you,

Leon. It's about Punchy... do you

mind if I sit down?

LEON

(realizing that he

cannot prevent it)

No... please...

SWANA

(to General Savitzky)

General, would you mind making my

excuses at our table? I'll be back

in a few moments.

GENERAL SAVITZKY

Certainly.

SWANA

Well, Leon, we can be proud of our

Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog

show.

SWANA

(continuing)

He won another blue ribbon and bit

the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him

the cutest sweater as a reward. You

should see him strut down the street

in it. He looks like a little

boulevardier.

(to Ninotchka)

You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy

for my birthday.

(to Leon)

You must have searched weeks before

you found anything as divine as

Punchy, didn't you, Leon?

LEON

(fed up with Swana's

tactics)

Months, Swana.

SWANA

(to Ninotchka)

Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are

talking in mysteries.... I'm sure

you wonder what it's all about.

NINOTCHKA

(dry and direct)

Not at all.... I understand perfectly,

Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You

made it very clear, madame.

SWANA

Dear me... I must be losing my

finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be

understood by everybody.

LEON

(acutely uncomfortable)

There's a charming crowd here tonight,

isn't there?

SWANA

I'm going, Leon...

(she rises, as does

Leon, delighted to

get rid of her)

but before I leave I must compliment

you on your gown, Madame Yakushova.

Is that what they're wearing in Moscow

this year?

NINOTCHKA

No, last year, madame.

SWANA

Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong

impression of the new Russia.

(cynically)

It must be charming. I'm glad

conditions are so improved. I assume

this is what the factory workers

wear at their dances?

NINOTCHKA

Exactly. You see, it would have been

embarrassing for people of my sort

to wear low-cut gowns in the old

Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks

across our backs were not very

becoming, and you know how vain women

are.

SWANA

You're absolutely right about the

Cossacks. We made an unpardonable

mistake when we let them use their

knouts. They had such reliable guns.

LEON

Will you do me a favor? Stop talking

about the good old days.

SWANA

A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm

afraid madame and I will never agree.

(she plays her trump

card)

The only thing we have in common is

our lawsuit and that will be decided

next week. I understand everything

will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

NINOTCHKA

You're right, madame, it will all be

over by Thursday.

SWANA

(rubbing it in)

It is unfortunate that you have so

few more days in Paris.

(she turns to Leon)

Be sure and redouble your efforts so

that madame can take some pleasant

memories when she returns to Moscow.

(she rises, Leon rising

too)

Good night.

(Ninotchka nods without

answering. To Leon)

Good night, Leon.

LEON

(coldly)

Good night, Swana.

NINOTCHKA

Now I think I need a glass of

champagne.

NINOTCHKA

(trying to break the

mood)

Quickly, please... tell me one of

your funny stories.

LEON

A funny story?

NINOTCHKA

You never finished the one about the

two Scotchmen with the names.

LEON

Well, there were two Scotchmen. One

was named McIntosh and one was named

McGillicuddy. They met on the street.

NINOTCHKA

Go on.

LEON

No, darling. I'll tell you another

story, a much better one.

(with deep sincerity)

The only thing that will be over on

Thursday is the lawsuit. There will

be no Thursday for us. Not next week

or any week. We won't let it happen.

I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is

that a good story?

NINOTCHKA

(touched)

Wonderful -- if one could believe

it.

LEON

You must, darling.

NINOTCHKA

(lifting her glass)

To the loveliest story I ever heard.

NINOTCHKA

(afraid of where the

conversation may

lead)

Shall we dance?

NINOTCHKA

(tipsily)

Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.

LEON

You just made that trip from goats

to grapes a little too fast.

NINOTCHKA

Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's

getting farther and farther away!

LEON

What, darling?

NINOTCHKA

Thursday.

LEON

Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be

all right.

NINOTCHKA

Comrades! Comrades!

LEON

(embarrassed)

Darling, darling... please!

NINOTCHKA

I must talk to my brothers!

LEON

Shhh! Shhh!

NINOTCHKA

Don't shush me. I am People! I want

to make a speech. I want to overthrow

the Duchess!

LEON

But, darling, you can't do that.

NINOTCHKA

Comrades! Good people of France!

LEON

Now, Ninotchka... please!

NINOTCHKA

They are all Duchesses here...

thousands of Duchesses... and I am

going to tell them.

LEON

Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but

first you're going in that door and

you're going to take a little spirits

of ammonia and lie down.

NINOTCHKA

(sweetly)

No speech?

LEON

(as though he were

addressing a little

child)

No speech.

NINOTCHKA

I love you, my little Leonitchka!

LEON

And I adore you, Ninotchua.

LEON

(to the bartender)

Give me a double brandy.

MANAGER

(very excitedly)

I'm very sorry, Count d'Algout, it

is most embarrassing, but the lady

you brought with you tonight is

spreading communistic propaganda in

the powder room.

LEON

Give me another double brandy.

MANAGER

That kind of propaganda is bad

anywhere, but inciting the attendants

of a powder room to go on strike....

Well, if she succeeds the consequences

will be disastrous.

LEON

What can I do about it?

MANAGER

She has been asked to leave the powder

room but without success. We would

appreciate if you would see to it

yourself.

LEON

(horrified)

You want me to go in there?

MANAGER

I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

LEON

(completely exhausted --

to the bartender)

Make it a triple brandy. As we

DISSOLVE TO:

LEON

(to Rakonin)

All right... you can tell the

Duchess... you can tell everybody...

they know anyhow... it doesn't make

any difference... now get out!

NINOTCHKA

(moving close to him)

Don't tell them where we're going,

sweetheart.

LEON

No. Nobody will find us.

NINOTCHKA

Are we going to build our little

house?

LEON

Yes... a little white house.

NINOTCHKA

Not white, darling.

LEON

All right, we'll make it red.

NINOTCHKA

No, don't let's have it any color...

no color... just a house house...

let's form our own party.

LEON

Right: Lovers of the world unite!

NINOTCHKA

(delighted)

And we won't stretch up our arms...

LEON

No! No!

NINOTCHKA

...and we won't clench our fist...

LEON

No! No!

NINOTCHKA

(tenderly)

Our salute will be a kiss.

LEON

Yes... a kiss... salute!

NINOTCHKA

(still in his arms)

I am so happy. No one can be so happy

without being punished. I will be

punished and I should be punished.

(she gets up)

I want to confess, darling.

LEON

I know... it's the Russian soul.

NINOTCHKA

(her gaiety mixed

with sadness)

Everyone wants to confess and if

they don't confess they make them

confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed

you I betrayed the Russian ideal.

Leon, I should be stood up against

the wall.

LEON

(sympathetically)

Would that make you any happier?

NINOTCHKA

Much happier.

LEON

All right.

NINOTCHKA

(happily)

I have paid the penalty. Now let's

have some music.

LEON

Let's turn on the radio.

NINOTCHKA

Radio! What is radio?

LEON

It's a little box that you buy on

the installment plan and before you

tune it in they tell you they have a

new model.

NINOTCHKA

(getting up)

Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob

that turns... a little knob... it

must be somewhere around here...

yes... here... I see...

NINOTCHKA

(triumphantly)

Here it is!

LEON

What shall we get? The news!

NINOTCHKA

No, no news. We don't want to know

what's happening in the world. We

want to be left alone, don't we?

LEON

Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

NINOTCHKA

(remembering vaguely)

Well, then we turn twice to the right

and stop at seven...

NINOTCHKA

(after a little pause,

sadly)

It's dead.

LEON

Well, it has to warm up... you have

to give it a chance... just like

people... like you and me... first

you wanted to fight me and now we

belong to the same party... salute!

NINOTCHKA

(as though she were

in heaven)

Now twice to the left and stop at

seventeen.

NINOTCHKA

(disappointed)

No music.

LEON

(also disappointed)

No, no music.

NINOTCHKA

(bitterly)

There it is... Thursday... you can't

rip it out of the week....

LEON

(helpfully)

But I can throw it out of the window.

NINOTCHKA

(philosophically)

It wouldn't be fair to the man in

the street.

(she pushes back the

lid)

There they are... they are terrible

things, those jewels....

LEON

...but big.

NINOTCHKA

...they are the tears of Old Russia...

see that stone?

LEON

Who cried that one?

NINOTCHKA

Czar Peter gave it to his wife,

Catherine the Great. For it he sold

ten thousand serfs in the market.

LEON

Now, darling, don't get impatient,

wait until we are married. You know

that worthless butler of mine...

that reactionary? Some day when I

come home to you I may say, "Darling,

I drove Gaston to the market and

look what I got from him!"

NINOTCHKA

(the economist now)

First ten thousand serfs... now just

Gaston. It is very encouraging.

LEON

Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on

you. You will teach these jewels.

For the first time they will learn

how they can look.

NINOTCHKA

They belong to the people.

LEON

(in a ceremonial voice)

I give them back to the people...

(as formal and steady

as possible under

the conditions he

puts the diadem on

her head)

I make you Ninotchka the Great...

Duchess of the People!... Grand

Duchess of the People!

NINOTCHKA

Is this the wish of the masses?

LEON

It is their wish.

NINOTCHKA

Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.

(in a low voice)

Can I make a speech now?

LEON

Please.

NINOTCHKA

Comrades! People of the world! The

revolution is on the march... I

know... wars will wash over us...

bombs will fall... all civilization

will crumble... but not yet, please...

wait, wait... what's the hurry?

(mixing reality with

fantasy)

Let us be happy... give us our

moment....

(turning to Leon)

We are happy, aren't we, Leon?

LEON

(fondly)

Yes, sweetheart.

(he holds her in his

arms)

NINOTCHKA

(her voice getting

dimmer and dimmer)

So happy and so tired.

NINOTCHKA

(charmingly)

Smile, little father, smile.

FADE OUT:

DISSOLVE TO:

SWANA

(ironically)

Good morning.

NINOTCHKA

(awakening gradually)

What?

SWANA

It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow

noon, to be exact. I hope you will

forgive me. I know it's extremely

cruel to waken anyone at such an

hour. Don't you recognize me? I am

the Duchess Swana.

SWANA

I know how you feel, my dear. The

morning after always does look grim

if you happen to be wearing last

night's dress. Don't be embarrassed

by my presence, though. You couldn't

have found anybody more sympathetic

to your condition. I remember once

in Petrograd when I felt exactly as

you do. I had to bow from a balcony

to the crowd. My dear, the masses

have no understanding of the feelings

of a lady before noon. Don't you

find that true?

NINOTCHKA

I think we can cut your visit short.

Leon is not here.

SWANA

Of course not, my dear! I didn't

come here with any such suspicion.

How ridiculous!

(with a glance toward

the living room)

Nor did I come here to pick up his

hat.

SWANA

(as she reaches the

threshold)

How stale last night's gaiety looks!

It has the taste of a dead cigarette.

NINOTCHKA

If you were encouraged to come here

by our meeting last night I am afraid

you misunderstood my attitude.

SWANA

Don't worry, you were quite rude

enough.

(during the following

speech, she draws

the curtains and

opens the windows)

Do you mind if I let in a little

fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it

will make you feel better and I want

you to be at your very best. In full

possession of your faculties, at

least.

NINOTCHKA

(regaining her usual

firmness)

Please come to the point. What is it

you want?

SWANA

I just dropped in to have a little

heart-to-heart talk with you.

NINOTCHKA

We have nothing to discuss.

SWANA

Now there you are completely wrong.

If we sit down for a little chat,

I'm sure we won't run out of

conversation and what's more it won't

be dull.

NINOTCHKA

Madame, what is it you people always

say, regardless of what you mean...

"I am delighted to have you here"? I

have not reached that stage of

civilization.

SWANA

That's all right... I grow on people.

NINOTCHKA

I must ask you to leave.

SWANA

Leave? That's exactly what I came

here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't

mean this hotel and I don't mean

Paris... I mean France. There's a

plane for Moscow at five-forty.

NINOTCHKA

(puzzled)

Madame, if you...

SWANA

Don't worry. I have already made

reservations. It's perfect flying

weather. They assure me there's a

fine tail wind which will sweep you

back to Moscow in no time.

NINOTCHKA

(still not

understanding)

If this is meant to be a joke it is

not funny. Or do you still think

you're issuing orders from your palace

in Petrograd?

SWANA

(bitterly)

My palace in Petrograd... yes, you

took that away from me. You took

away my czar, my country, my people,

everything I had...

(with emphasis)

but nothing more -- I warn you.

NINOTCHKA

(simply)

People cannot be taken away, madame,

neither a hundred and sixty million

nor one. Not if you have their love.

You hadn't. That's why you're not in

Russia any longer, and that's why

you came here this morning.

SWANA

Very interesting, my dear, but

couldn't you write all that from

Moscow? A dissertation on love on

Soviet stationery -- would be an

amusing paradox.

NINOTCHKA

It is not enough to be witty, madame.

People grow tired of being

entertained. You made that mistake

before. Problems were never solved

by bowing from a balcony.

SWANA

My dear, you don't know how impressive

I could be. Did you ever see me in

my regalia with my diadem and all my

jewels?

SWANA

You can't deny we gave the people

their money's worth -- almost --

eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!

NINOTCHKA

(desperately)

I must insist that you leave.

SWANA

Not before you agree to use those

reservations to Moscow.

NINOTCHKA

In that case I can only say good-by.

NINOTCHKA

(into the telephone)

Elysee 2763.

SWANA

(standing in the door)

I wouldn't waken Leon. After last

night I would say not before three

o'clock at the earliest.

NINOTCHKA

I told you to go, madame.

SWANA

Believe me, Leon can't help you. He

doesn't know anything about the

jewels... I give you my word... I

swear it.

NINOTCHKA

Where are they?

SWANA

You were very careless with our

precious jewels, my dear. They're

too expensive a toy for two children

to play with.

NINOTCHKA

Where are they?

SWANA

Don't worry. Fortunately last night

a very trustworthy friend kept his

eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped

his function as a waiter but he

fulfilled his duty as a Russian.

(she draws back the

fur scarf she is

wearing, revealing a

diamond star, one of

the jewels we have

seen)

I just put this on for sentiment.

The rest are absolutely safe. I assure

you. But if you feel like notifying

the police...

NINOTCHKA

You leave me no choice.

SWANA

Won't it be rather embarrassing for

a Soviet Envoy to disclose the

circumstances under which she lost

them?

NINOTCHKA

I will have to face the consequences,

but so will you. Don't forget they

will ask how you got them.

SWANA

That's very simple to answer. They

were given to me by my mother. They

were given to her by her mother, in

fact they're mine, you cannot steal

what belongs to you!

NINOTCHKA

They always belonged to the Russian

people. They were paid for with their

sweat, their blood, their lives and

you will give them back!

SWANA

(triumphantly)

I told you we had plenty to talk

about. Shall we sit down?

SWANA

(very matter-of-fact)

Now, let's free ourselves from

emotionalism and try to solve the

problem in a practical way. Our

situation has changed considerably.

Before I had only a claim to the

jewels. Now I have the jewels.

NINOTCHKA

In other words moral ideas have no

weight with you... all right, then

let's deal with legal facts. You

know that France has recognized the

Soviet.

SWANA

Unfortunately.

NINOTCHKA

Under Soviet law the jewels belong

to the State. France is going to

uphold that ownership.

SWANA

My lawyer agrees with you. He says

France will uphold it in every court,

but I will drag you through every

court, don't forget that. And when I

say it will take two years I am, as

always, conservative.

NINOTCHKA

Won't those two years in court be

expensive for you? I know that money

was no object as long as you could

squeeze it from the pockets of the

people, but now...

SWANA

I may run out of money, but you have

already run out of bread. Two years

is a long time for your comrades to

wait.

NINOTCHKA

I see. You have calculated in terms

of hunger.

SWANA

No, I just wanted to be absolutely

impartial. Both of us are faced with

two rather uncomfortable years. We

can condense these two years to two

minutes if you want to accept my

proposition. Ninotchka now realizes

what she is after.

NINOTCHKA

Go on.

SWANA

I am willing to hand over the jewels

and sign the necessary papers if you

take that five-forty plane to Moscow.

NINOTCHKA

(quietly)

That's not the way to win him back...

not Leon.

SWANA

I think I know Leon quite as well as

you... possibly a little better.

Leave that worry to me. Five-forty

leaves you time enough to close the

deal with Monsieur Mercier, but

naturally you'll be too busy for any

farewells. I'll see to it that

everything is done in the most

expeditious manner and I will also

see you to the airport. That's my

proposition, Comrade Yakushova.

NINOTCHKA

(into telephone)

Yes...

(it is Leon)

Oh hello...

NINOTCHKA

Good morning, Leon...

(forcing herself to

be gay so that he

will not suspect

anything)

... no, you didn't waken me... I am

fine, thank you.... Yes, it was...

marvelous.... What?... for luncheon?

I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be

very busy...

(looking for excuses)

well, I have a lot of things to attend

to today.... What?... Well to tell

you the truth I am a little tired

and I would like to rest...

(she forces herself

to laugh)

you may be right... perhaps it is

the champagne.... For dinner?... Of

course... seven o'clock here?...

(realizing that she

will be gone by then)

seven o'clock is all right....

Where?... That will be lovely....

Yes...

(there is a knock on

the door)

Come in.

(into the telephone)

Yes?...

(looking toward the

door she sees

something which makes

her stop the

conversation)

Just a moment...

(she puts the receiver

on the table and

walks toward the

door)

NINOTCHKA

(to bellboy)

You can leave it here.

NINOTCHKA

(into telephone)

Operator, will you switch the call

please?... Hello?... Darling, your

present just arrived.... It's very

silly and very wonderful... thank

you... No, I won't forget... seven

o'clock....

(with great tenderness)

Good-by, my darling.... What?...

Oh...

(softly)

salute!

NINOTCHKA

I am sorry to have kept you waiting,

madame.

DISSOLVE TO:

SWANA

Good afternoon, Jacqueline.

MAID

Good afternoon, Your Highness.

(hesitantly)

Madame, I...

SWANA

You didn't find my glove. All right,

you're forgiven.

MAID

Thank you, Your Highness. Count

d'Algout is waiting. He's been here

some time.

SWANA

Leon, darling, how nice! Have you

ordered tea or a cocktail?

LEON

No thanks, Swana.

SWANA

Did I act stupidly last night? Should

I apologize?

LEON

I'm the one who should apologize. I

should have talked to you before.

SWANA

Is this, by any chance, going to be

a confession?

LEON

Yes.

SWANA

Oh, no, my little Volga boatman.

Have you forgotten our First

Commandment: Never Complain -- Never

Explain. It has worked so often and

so perfectly, don't let's break the

rule. And please don't look so guilty,

otherwise I'll...

LEON

This time, Swana -- just this once --

I must ask you to listen.

SWANA

All right, I'll listen.

LEON

I know you hate the obvious but do

you mind if, at this moment, I'm not

in the least subtle?

SWANA

Brutal frankness, if you insist.

LEON

There are a hundred ways to approach

it, but I feel it can best be said

in one simple phrase. I'm in love,

Swana.

SWANA

And I thought it was something

serious! How could you frighten me

so?

LEON

It must be serious, Swana. Not long

ago I'd have considered such a

statement rather juvenile and rather

middle class. Now I can say it without

stammering, without a blush. I'm in

love, Swana.

SWANA

Say it over and over again, Leon.

Words are a wonderful safety valve,

and that's what you need -- because

you know it's impossible, don't you?

LEON

I have to be simple again, Swana,

and you may find it shockingly banal.

I've thought it over and I'm willing

to take all the consequences, even

if it means a complete readjustment

of my way of living.

SWANA

Leon! This has the ugly sound of

regeneration.

LEON

I'm afraid that's what it is.

SWANA

The same old trouble, Leon. You're

always late. Whether you're taking

me to the Opera or calling for me at

a beauty shop, you're never on time.

And now, when it's a question of

your reform -- late again.

(she glances at her

wrist watch)

By about five minutes.

LEON

What is this, Swana?

SWANA

Knowing the efficiency of the French

Air Service I think I can guarantee

that Madame Yakushova has already

taken off for Moscow.

LEON

Has done what?

SWANA

She's gone, Leon.

LEON

Do you expect me to believe that?

SWANA

Here's the telephone. If you call

the hotel you will find that you

have no seven o'clock appointment.

BULJANOFF

Imagine, for once in our lives we

were in Paris and we never went to

the Eiffel Tower.

KOPALSKI

That's right.

IRANOFF

They tell me it has a wonderful

restaurant on the second floor.

KOPALSKI

While you eat, you look at the view.

NINOTCHKA

Yes, it is an amazing piece of

engineering. Still the most remarkable

iron structure in the world. Leading

to the top there is a staircase of

over a thousand steps... but an

elevator is included in the price of

admission.

FADE OUT:

OFFICIAL

Well, everything is in order. I hope

you will enjoy your trip to Russia,

madame.

ENGLISH LADY

Thank you. Oh, by the way, I've heard

so many rumors about laundry

conditions in Russia. Is it advisable

to take one's own towels?

OFFICIAL

Certainly not, madame. That's only

capitalistic propaganda. We change

the towel every week.

ENGLISH LADY

Oh... thank you.

OFFICIAL

Yes, please?

OFFICIAL

(into phone)

Yes... Comrade Cazabine? No, I'm

sorry... he hasn't been with us for

six months. He was called back to

Russia and was investigated. You can

get further details from his widow.

LEON

Pardon me, I am very interested in

what you just said -- you mean when

an envoy goes back to Russia -- if

they don't like what he has done

they put him out of the way?

OFFICIAL

Not always... look at me... I've

been back twice.

(he knocks on wood)

LEON

(his alarm growing)

Here's my passport.... Please give

me a visa. I have to leave for Russia

immediately.

OFFICIAL

(reading passport)

Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a

nobleman!

LEON

Don't hold that against me... please!

OFFICIAL

Why should an aristocrat want to go

to Russia?

LEON

Business.

OFFICIAL

What business?

LEON

Private.

OFFICIAL

There is no privacy in Russia. This

whole thing seems very suspicious.

What's the real reason? If you ever

want to get into Russia, take my

advice... confess!

LEON

(dismayed)

Confess what?

OFFICIAL

Are you sympathetic to the former

Czaristic government -- the White

Russians?

LEON

On the contrary -- I don't want to

have anything to do with them.

OFFICIAL

You believe in our cause?

LEON

Oh... I think it's great! Everyone

works -- everyone contributes --

that's what I want to do -- work! I

make my own bed -- you can call up

my butler! I don't believe in the

right of the individual. I like the

Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being

the same. You just like me -- me

just like you -- I use your comb --

you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a

great life.... Please... give me

that visa!

SWANA

Hello, Leon darling!

LEON

(startled)

Hello.

SWANA

(suavely) After our talk last night

I took it for granted that you would

drop in here this morning. Knowing

how difficult it is to get into Soviet

Russia, I thought I might be of some

assistance to you.

(to the Official)

May I introduce myself? I am the

Duchess Swana of Russia... another

Russia.

LEON

Now, please, Swana.

SWANA

(to the Official)

Count d'Algout was for several years

my personal representative and if it

is necessary to sign any affidavit

for him I'll be delighted.

LEON

(bitterly)

That does it, Swana.

(he leads her toward

the door)

Now you mustn't miss your appointment

with your hair-dresser.

SWANA

(stopping at the door)

Just in case they don't give you

your visa to Russia I want you to

know that I have signed a contract

for my memoirs and rented a lovely

little chateau in the Touraine, and

if you feel the need of a change...

LEON

Thank you, Swana. You are very

gracious.

LEON

She must have her little joke.

(the Official responds

with a stony look)

You're not going to take that

seriously.

OFFICIAL

The Grand Duchess Swana... active in

the White Russian movement?

LEON

Believe me, I have no connection

with her any longer... I swear I

haven't!

OFFICIAL

But you had!

LEON

Listen, I want to be absolutely frank

with you. I have no business in

Moscow.

OFFICIAL

I think so too.

LEON

I want to see a friend of mine... a

very dear friend.... It's a personal

matter which has nothing to do with

politics or social philosophies....

It's a girl.

OFFICIAL

So it's love which drags you to

Moscow.

LEON

Yes!

OFFICIAL

No visa.

LEON

(fighting for his

point)

I must get into that country of yours!

OFFICIAL

Oh no. No visa.

LEON

(more aggressively)

That's impossible! Nobody has the

right.... You can't do that!... If

you don't give me that visa...

OFFICIAL

(ironically)

You're going to force us... huh?

LEON

(growing violent)

Now look here... you advertise all

over the world that you want people

to go into your country and when

someone tries to get in, you keep

him out!

OFFICIAL

Why should I take a chance?

LEON

On what?

OFFICIAL

How do I know you don't want to blow

up a factory?

LEON

What for... why?

OFFICIAL

Or a tunnel or a bridge...

LEON

Suspicions... nothing but

suspicions!... That's the trouble

with you! If you don't let me in

I'll stand in front of this office

of yours and warn people to keep

away from Russia!... I'll picket

your whole country....

LEON

I'll boycott you, that's what I'm

going to do!... No more vodka... no

more caviar... no more Tchaikovsky...

no more borscht.... Wait a minute, I

know something better than that...

OFFICIAL

What?

LEON

And you can tell the Kremlin that's

just the beginning!

OFFICIAL

No visa.

March, march, march! Comrades of the

World, never has there been such a

May Day parade as this! Already for

four hours the pavements of Moscow

have resounded to the tread of a

million boots! Thousands of gun-

carriages have thundered past.

Thousands of tanks, combined with

our mighty air force, have

demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor

that we are ready and invincible!

Now past me marches the great army

of our civilians! Men and women of

NINOTCHKA

Good evening, Anna.

ANNA

Good evening, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA

Aren't you late?

ANNA

No, the opera starts an hour later

tonight on account of the parade.

NINOTCHKA

Didn't you march?

ANNA

They didn't let me. I am in disgrace.

Last week at the performance of Carmen

I played a sour note. The conductor

got so excited he yelled, "There's

sabotage in the string section!"

NINOTCHKA

Too bad... you missed an inspiring

day, Anna.

ANNA

I know... my heart is sad... but my

feet are happy. When all the tanks

and guns were roaring over the Red

Square I sat here all by myself and

played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad

at all.

(she has noticed

Ninotchka's

preparations)

Are you expecting someone?

NINOTCHKA

A few friends... just a little dinner

party.

ANNA

What are you serving?

NINOTCHKA

An omelet.

ANNA

(puzzled)

An omelet! Aren't you living a little

above your ration?

NINOTCHKA

Well, I've saved up two eggs and

each of my friends is bringing his

own so we'll manage.

ANNA

It just goes to prove the theory of

our State. If you stand alone it

means a boiled egg but if you're

true to the collective spirit and

stick together you've got an omelet.

(devilishly)

That reminds me... have you heard

the latest they're telling about the

Kremlin?

ANNA

(whispering)

I'll tell you later.

(after Gurganov has

disappeared into the

other room she

continues)

That Gurganov, you never know whether

he's on his way to the washroom or

the Secret Police.

NINOTCHKA

You should be more careful, Anna.

ANNA

And you too, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA

(amazed)

About what?

ANNA

Ever since you have been back from

Paris...

NINOTCHKA

I haven't talked to anyone about

Paris. I haven't said a word.

ANNA

That's just it. It makes people feel

queer. I dont' want you to get in

any trouble.

NINOTCHKA

I have nothing to hide.

ANNA

You should. I'll show you.

ANNA

When I passed through the laundry

yard today I saw all the women huddled

around this so I brought it up here.

Things like this create a bad feeling.

First they didn't know whose it was.

Then they saw the Paris label and

did it start a commotion! Some said

it's what we all ought to wear and

others said it's like hanging foreign

ideas on our clothesline. It

undermines our whole cause.

NINOTCHKA

(aware of the pettiness

which surrounds her)

I see.

ANNA

You know how it is today... all you

have to do is wear a pair of silk

stockings and they suspect you of

counter-revolution.

NINOTCHKA

Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here

when I wash it next. I should hate

to see our country endangered by my

underwear.

ANNA

(confidentially)

Ninotchka, you know I am your friend,

you can trust me.... Did you bring

back anything else?

NINOTCHKA

(with feeling)

No, I left everything in Paris. I

just happened to be wearing this.

ANNA

Tell me... what else did you have?

NINOTCHKA

(enjoying the thought)

Well, a hat...

ANNA

What was it like?

NINOTCHKA

It was very silly.... I would be

ashamed to wear it here.

ANNA

As beautiful as that? What else?

Come, tell me.

NINOTCHKA

An evening gown.

ANNA

(puzzled)

Evening gown?

NINOTCHKA

A dress you wear in the evening.

ANNA

What do you wear in the morning?

NINOTCHKA

When you get up you put on a negligee,

and then you change to a morning

frock.

ANNA

You mean to tell me you wear a

different dress for different times

of the day?

NINOTCHKA

Yes.

ANNA

Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.

NINOTCHKA

No, my dear, it is true. That's how

they live in the other world. Here

we dress to have our bodies covered...

to keep warm....

ANNA

And there?

NINOTCHKA

Well, sometimes they're not completely

covered but... they don't freeze.

ANNA

(fingering the piece

of lingerie)

They must have wonderful materials

to make a thing like this so soft...

something you don't even see.

NINOTCHKA

You feel it, though.

ANNA

(hesitantly)

Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up

if we weren't such good friends.

NINOTCHKA

What is it, Anna?

ANNA

You know I told you that Pavlov and

I are going to get married when he

comes back from the maneuvers. Would

it be asking too much...

NINOTCHKA

You want this?

ANNA

Just for the honeymoon.

NINOTCHKA

You can have it for good. It is my

wedding present.

ANNA

Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

ANNA

Am I going to play that cadenza

tonight!

VOICE ON RADIO

Individuals? Yes, as atoms in the

cosmos of Soviet Russia. Family?

Yes. One great family of one hundred

and sixty million, struggling,

fighting, victorious Russian

proletarians. Thus shall we pursue

our way into the future, fists

clenched, hearts encased in steel

armed against bourgeois sentimentality

and...

NINOTCHKA

No music.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

NINOTCHKA

(with great warmth)

How are you, you three scoundrels?

KOPALSKI

(wryly)

Well, we're back home.

BULJANOFF

(sourly)

You know what they say -- there's

nothing like home.

IRANOFF

That's right... and we might as well

face it.

NINOTCHKA

(trying not to say

what she feels)

Come, now, you must not talk that

way.... You have to adjust

yourselves.... We must be brave.

IRANOFF

Brave... that's right.

BULJANOFF

Let's be happy that we're all alive.

IRANOFF

And that's something we owe to

Ninotchka.

KOPALSKI

If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin

such a wonderful report about us,

who knows what would have happened?

BULJANOFF

I can tell you exactly.

NINOTCHKA

Now let's forget everything except

that we're together.

BULJANOFF

That's right.

IRANOFF

Let's do that.

KOPALSKI

(falling in with her

attempt)

It's a real Paris reunion.

IRANOFF

If you close your eyes and listen to

our voices we might be in Paris.

NINOTCHKA

Let's not close our eyes. There are

many good things to see here too.

BULJANOFF

(cynically)

I think I need my glasses.

KOPALSKI

(reprimanding him

quietly)

A little more tact... look how nicely

she's fixed the table -- all for us.

BULJANOFF

(in a loud voice,

trying to make up

for his faux pas)

How nicely you've fixed the table,

Ninotchka.

IRANOFF

What a lovely room you have here.

BULJANOFF

How many families live here with

you?

NINOTCHKA

Only myself and two other girls. One

is a cello player in the opera and

the other a street-car conductor.

IRANOFF

(impressed)

Just three people in a room this

size? Whew!

KOPALSKI

(inspecting the room)

And your own gas cooker? That's

marvelous!

(forgetting himself)

Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...

NINOTCHKA

Sssh! Once and for all, we're in

Moscow!

KOPALSKI

(walking over to the

window)

Yes, there's no doubt of that...

(sarcastically)

Just look out of the window and there

it is.

NINOTCHKA

And it's great! Think what it was a

few years ago and what it is now.

IRANOFF

She's right...

(under his breath)

anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.

BULJANOFF

Just see how happy the people look...

from here....

KOPALSKI

Can you blame them?... at least the

May Day parade is over.

BULJANOFF

That's another thing... it's spring.

NINOTCHKA

The same spring we had in Paris.

Just as good.

KOPALSKI

Even the swallows are back.

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF

Yes, that's right.

IRANOFF

Maybe that's the same swallow we saw

in Paris!

BULJANOFF

It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must

have been in Paris! You can see it

in his whole attitude! He just picked

up a crumb of our black bread, shook

his head, and dropped it.

KOPALSKI

If you asked him why he left France

I bet he couldn't name one good

reason.

BULJANOFF

I should be a swallow! Right now I

would be sitting in front of the

Cafe de Paris picking up flakes of

French pastry that would melt in my

bill.

NINOTCHKA

Now, comrades... there is something

better in life than crumbs of French

pastry.

KOPALSKI

(the realist)

Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....

NINOTCHKA

We will get that... we'll get

everything... maybe a little bit

later but we'll get it... We must be

patient... Finally we got the spring,

didn't we? We got the swallows, and

you will get your apfel strudel too.

BULJANOFF

(consolingly)

And if it is too late for you your

children will eat it.

IRANOFF

(breaking the mood)

Let's forget the future... let's

stop being sentimental... let's start

that omelet.

KOPALSKI

That's right.

(he takes a little

box out of his pocket)

Here's my egg.

(he hands it to

Ninotchka)

IRANOFF

And here's mine.

BULJANOFF

Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.

NINOTCHKA

Don't worry... there will be enough.

IRANOFF

Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in

real Parisian style!

KOPALSKI

Let's fill it with confitures, des

prunes...

BULJANOFF

...des raisins de Madere, des

framboises...

(...with grapes of

Madeira, with

raspberries...)

IRANOFF

...des petites fraises des bois...

de la creme de Bretagne...

(...with small wild

strawberries... with

cream...)

KOPALSKI

...so it blows up that big... what

they call an Omelette Surprise!

BULJANOFF

And the surprise is there's nothing

in it.

KOPALSKI

I know, but if we can't put in all

these wonderful things at least let's

put in some imagination.

(he raises his voice)

In that one omelet we'll taste the

whole of Paris!

IRANOFF

(seeing him)

Sssh!

IRANOFF

A man like that... all he has to do

is to walk through a room and the

omelet drops.

VLADIMIR

(calling into the

room)

Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman

left a letter for you.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

What is it, Ninotchka?

NINOTCHKA

It's from Paris.

IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF

From Paris?

KOPALSKI

A bill?

NINOTCHKA

From Leon.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS

From Leon!... How is he?... Come,

tell us... open it... tell us... how

is he?

IRANOFF

(very sympathetic)

Bad news?

NINOTCHKA

Look for yourselves.

KOPALSKI

Well, I think it's getting late.

Good night, Ninotchka.

IRANOFF

Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

NINOTCHKA

(with great warmth)

Good night, my friends.

BULJANOFF

They can't censor our memories, can

they?

FADE OUT:

RAZININ

Good morning, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA

(very businesslike)

Good morning, Comrade Commissar.

Here is my report on the materials

available for trading in the next

four months.

RAZININ

Does this include the products of

the Far Eastern provinces?

NINOTCHKA

Yes, it does.

RAZININ

You mean you have finished the whole

investigation?

NINOTCHKA

Yes.

RAZININ

That's marvelous.... You must have

worked day and night.... Don't you

ever sleep?

NINOTCHKA

I need very little sleep. We must be

extremely careful what goods we take

in exchange. I have already started

a survey of our most urgent needs.

RAZININ

Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will

have to turn over that work to someone

else.

NINOTCHKA

(startled)

May I ask why?

RAZININ

Please... sit down.

RAZININ

Cigarette?

NINOTCHKA

Thank you.

RAZININ

Well, Comrade, have you heard from

your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff,

and Iranoff?

NINOTCHKA

No.

RAZININ

I haven't either, but I've heard

about them. You must realize it was

only on the strength of your Paris

report that I sent them to

Constantinople; without that I never

would have trusted them on a mission

as important as the fur deal.

NINOTCHKA

May I ask what has happened?

RAZININ

As soon as our representatives go to

a foreign country they seem to lose

all sense of balance. If I told you

what's going on in Constantinople

right now you wouldn't believe it.

Those three have been sitting there

for six weeks and haven't sold a

piece of fur.

(he points to the

folder)

This anonymous report was sent me.

They are dragging the good name of

our country through every cafe and

night club. Here...

(he reads from the

report)

"How can the Bolshevik cause gain

respect among the Moslems if your

three representatives, Buljanoff,

Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk

that they throw a carpet out of their

hotel window and complain to the

management that it didn't fly?"

NINOTCHKA

Oh, they shouldn't do such things.

Are you sure this report is correct?

RAZININ

It gives details which couldn't be

invented. Naturally I want to verify

it and that's why I need you.

NINOTCHKA

(apprehensively)

You want me to go to Constantinople?

RAZININ

Yes... leaving immediately.

NINOTCHKA

(her one object to

escape the mission)

I appreciate the confidence you show

in me, but I must ask you to entrust

someone else with this mission. I

should hate to interrupt my present

work. I am positive that my survey

is more important than finding out

whether three of our comrades have

been drinking some extra glasses of

champagne.

RAZININ

(austerely)

That is for me to decide, Comrade

Yakushova.

NINOTCHKA

I am sorry, I don't want to overstep

my position -- but please... don't

send me.

RAZININ

I don't understand.

NINOTCHKA

(making a last effort)

How can I make myself clear... It is

difficult to express but I'd rather

not go to foreign countries any more.

Please, Comrade... let me stay here...

let me finish my work... I am in the

rhythm of it now... I don't want to

go away. I don't want to be sent

into that foreign atmosphere again.

It throws one out of gear.... Let me

finish my work... I have concentrated

everything in it... Please... don't

make me go.

RAZININ

Please don't waste my time, Comrade.

Do your duty. Good-by.

NINOTCHKA

I will do my best.

KOPALSKI

(indicating the room)

How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't

it wonderful?

IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF

Tell us... tell us.

NINOTCHKA

But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...

IRANOFF

Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start

figuring it out in cows.

NINOTCHKA

You've done it again and I am

responsible. How can you forget

yourselves this way? You were sent

here to make money, not to spend it.

IRANOFF

Buljanoff, she still has those old-

fashioned Bolshevik ideas.

BULJANOFF

It is high time you got out of Russia.

NINOTCHKA

(not knowing what to

do with the three

rascals)

I must be stern with you.

KOPALSKI

(delighted)

That's our old Ninotchka!

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF

(agreeing with him)

Yes, yes.

NINOTCHKA

Don't forget, the day will come when

you will have to face Razinin.

BULJANOFF

(cockily)

Good old Razinin! Is he still alive?

How does he manage?

NINOTCHKA

But, Comrades...

KOPALSKI

(with the happiness

of being free again

in his voice)

We are not comrades any more... we

are friends, Ninotchka.

BULJANOFF

Imagine, we don't have to whisper

any longer.

IRANOFF

We can say whatever we want. We can

shout... we can complain... Look...

(he opens the door

leading to corridor)

The service in this hotel is terrible!

(he closes the door)

See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any

attention. That's freedom.

BULJANOFF

(dryly)

No, that's bad management.

NINOTCHKA

Is it possible to bring you back to

reality for a moment? I must have a

complete report of your negotiations

and a detailed expense account.

BULJANOFF

Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There

is a Turkish proverb which says, "If

something smells bad, why put your

nose in it?"

NINOTCHKA

And there is a Russian saying: "The

cat who has cream on his whiskers

had better find good excuses."

BULJANOFF

With our cream situation what it is,

it is Russia which should apologize

to the cats.

NINOTCHKA

(helplessly)

Friends... friends, Buljanoff,

Iranoff...

KOPALSKI

(afraid of being left

out)

...and Kopalski.

NINOTCHKA

(pleadingly)

Don't make it difficult for me. This

is no more a pleasure trip for me

than it is for you.

IRANOFF

That was our idea when we first came.

All we thought we would get out of

this trip was a Turkish bath, but...

we learned better.

KOPALSKI

Ninotchka, we are in the magic East,

the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...

IRANOFF

...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves...

into one single hour you can crowd a

thousand and one nights.

BULJANOFF

All you have to do is say "open

sesame."

NINOTCHKA

I don't know how I can get you out

of it this time. How will it end?

What will happen to you?

BULJANOFF

(intimately)

Shall we tell her?

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI

Yes.

BULJANOFF

(proudly)

Ninotchka, I hope you'll be our guest.

NINOTCHKA

Guest?

BULJANOFF

We have opened a restaurant...

IRANOFF

...we have a wonderful electric sign:

"Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and

Kopalski."

NINOTCHKA

You mean you are deserting Russia?

KOPALSKI

(singing the song of

freedom)

Don't call it desertion. Our little

restaurant... that is our Russia...

the Russia of borscht, the Russia of

beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour

cream...

IRANOFF

...the Russia of piroshki... people

will eat and love it.

BULJANOFF

We are not only serving good food,

we are serving our country... we are

making friends.

NINOTCHKA

(completely bewildered)

Who gave you this idea? What is

responsible for all this?

KOPALSKI

(with a gleam in his

eye)

There's something in Constantinople...

something irresistible....

IRANOFF

...it is in the air... it may come

around the corner as you walk down

the street....

BULJANOFF

...it may step out of a bazaar... it

may wait for you in a corridor... it

may hide in the shadow of a

minaret....

KOPALSKI

(pointing to the

balcony)

Right now it's on the balcony.

LEON

(looking longingly at

Ninotchka)

They wouldn't let me in so I had to

get you out.

NINOTCHKA

(still taken aback)

So -- you're behind all this. I should

have known.

LEON

Trying to keep me away from you! It

couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't

go on forever punching passport

officials in the nose -- but I found

a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to

see you. I wrote and wrote but all

my letters came back.

NINOTCHKA

The one I got they wouldn't let me

read.

(carried away by

emotion)

It began, "Ninotchka, my darling,"

and ended, "Yours, Leon."

LEON

(with great feeling

and sincerity)

I won't tell you what came between...

I'll prove it. It will take a long

time, Ninotchka... at least a

lifetime.

NINOTCHKA

But, Leon, I am only here for a few

days.

LEON

If you don't stay with me, I'll have

to continue my fight. I'll travel

wherever Russian commissions are.

I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs,

Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world

will be crowded with Russian

restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia.

Once you saved your country by going

back. This time you can save it by

staying here.

NINOTCHKA

Well, when it is a choice between my

personal interest and the good of my

country, how can I waver? No one

shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.

FADE OUT:

THE END
