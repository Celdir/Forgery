An Original Screenplay

by

Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner

REHEARSAL DRAFT

CHARLIE (0.S).

Hi this is Charlie and...

Come on, say your name.

PEGGY (O.S.)

Peggy Sue.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

And we're here on the couch...

PEGGY (0.S.)

Don't say that...

CHARLIE (O.S.)

We're here on the sofa bed...

PEGGY (0.S.)

Charlie...

CHARLIE (O.S.)

...to record how much we love each

other. Sitting beside me is the

cutest majorette in the history of

the world. And she would Like to

say something.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

Come on Peggy. Say what we

rehearsed.

PEGGY (O.S.)

I can't. I'm too embarrassed.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

But you love me don't you?

PEGGY (0.S.)

Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

And nothing will ever change that.

SCOTT

Boy, have they changed. Who gets

it?

BETH

I don't know, just put it back.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

Oh, gotta go. Here's a little

makeout music.

CHARLIE

Goddamnit, I just can't hit those

high notes anymore.

JANET

You know Charlie, if you're serious

about this, I know a great vocal

coach.

BETH

Hi Dad, can I have 100 dollars for

a brake job?

CHARLIE

Did I hear 70 dollars? What do you

need 50 dollars for? How's your

Mom?

WORKER

Coming through.

CHARLIE

Frank, watch the clock.

PEGGY

There's something pathetic parked

in front of my house.

CHARLIE

Come off it, Peggy. And what do you

mean your house? This is my house.

I paid for it, I'm still paying for

it.

PEGGY

I'm still waiting for the mortgage

check.

CHARLIE

I mailed it to you on Wednesday.

PEGGY

Well, today's Saturday and it's

still not here.

CHARLIE

Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not

used to that stuff. You always did

the bills. Blame the damn post

office.

PEGGY

That stays.

CHARLIE

You got a Tab?

PEGGY

I don't buy them anymore. You were

the only one who drank them.

CHARLIE

You don't want them? They're going

to make a big comeback any minute.

Mark my words, these lamps are

going to...

PEGGY

I know. Put Scott through college.

CHARLIE

I'll think of a way to sell, them.

(beat)

One day.

PEGGY

Are you taking Janet to the reunion

tonight?

CHARLIE

I'm not going.

SCOTT

Come on Dad!

CHARLIE

Be right there. I'll go through the

rest of this stuff next weekend.

SCOTT

Bye Mom.

PEGGY

Bye sweetheart.

CHARLIE

(with real, regret)

I never thought it would go

this far.

DISSOLVE:

PEGGY

If the pastries aren't here by nine

thirty, call Monica and threaten

her life.

PEGGY

I'll be back by noon.

BETH

Hi Monica. You just missed Mom.

MONICA

Sorry I'm late. My Bobo's back in

town.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Hi. I'm Dolores Dodge. We're taking

calls today on surrogate mothers.

Wombs for rent. I want to know how

you feel..

PEGGY

Oh, Dolores.

PEGGY

Carol!

CAROL

Peggy Sue!

CAROL

I haven't seen you in years. In all

that time, haven't you at least

tried another hair style?

PEGGY

1 just did it for the reunion. I

thought it would be fun.

CAROL

You're probably the only one who

could carry it off.

BETH

Where were you? You said you'd be

back at twelve.

PEGGY

This is my old friend Carol.. I

told you about her.

BETH

r was worried about you  You didn't

even call. You're always on my case

if I don't call..

PEGGY

How do you like my hair?

BETH

It looks great. Don't change the

subject. You know how busy

Saturdays are. And I can't do the

icing. I always mess up the roses.

You're not being very responsible.

CAROL

Who's the mother around here?

BETH

Sometimes I wonder.

WAITER

Here Charlie, extra fortune

cookies. Good luck.

CHARLIE

Thanks.

CHARLIE

(manic)

Next week you'll be selling Sanyo

remote control VCRs for three

hundred and ninetynine dollars? Oh

no!

(sings)

Crazy Charlie...

CHARLIE

You'll give away Mitsubishi giant

screen TVs for twelve hundred and

ninetyfive dollars! Oh no! I'll go

broke!

(sings)

Crazy Charlie...

CHARLIE

You won't be undersold on stereos,

videos, microwaves or blenders!

(sings)

Crazy Charlie, Crazy Charlie,

I'm not breaking cookies,

I'm smashing prices.

(rolling his eyes like

Fabian)

Crazy Charlie, he insane.

PEGGY (0.S.)

Turn that off.

BETS

When are you going to stop being so

mad at Dad? How do you think that

makes me feel?

PEGGY

I have a lot of unresolved feelings

about him. I don't trust him.

Besides, I hate those commercials.

BETH

I'm sorry I asked. We don't have

time for another heartto heart.

Here, try on the dress.

Peggy tries on the fifties dress lying on the bed.

PEGGY

But I want you and Scott to

understand.

(beat)

Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe

he's smashed too many fortune

cookies.

BETH

Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's

missing the reunion because of you.

You know he wants to go.

PEGGY

Then we'd both have a miserable

time. What do you think?

BETH

Hey, you're a hip chick. You look

like you stepped right out of Life

magazine. Any time you want to

borrow it again, just ask.

PEGGY

Borrow?! This was my dress.

(beat)

Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm

the only one? I don't even want to

go. Everybody's just going to

say...

(imitating commercial)

Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?

BETH

Mom, lots of people are separated

and divorced.

PEGGY

Not from the guy with the

lowest prices in town.

PEGGY

I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should

go home and change.

BETH

Why are you so nervous? What is the

matter with you today?

PEGGY

I don't know. Reunions do funny

things to people.

MADDY

You two look like that soap

commercial. Which one's the

daughter and which one's the

mother?

ARTHUR

You took this seriously. You're a

real blast from the past.

PEGGY

It was Beth's idea.

MADDY

I wish I had the nerve. And the

figure.

ARTHUR

You always were a crazy little gal,

Peg.

PEGGY

Arthur, please don't call me Peg.

PEGGY

Beth's boyfriend is playing in the

band.

MADDY

It must run in the family.

BETH

What does?

ARTHUR

You and your mother both seem to

fall for musicians.

ARTHUR

Hey, there's Terry and Leon.

MADDY

Peggy, would you find a table?

We'll see you in a little while.

PEGGY

Okay.

RICHARD (0.S.)

Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?

PEGGY

I was once. Richard!? Richard

Norvik? I didn't recognize you.

RICHARD

You look exactly the same.

PEGGY

I just did it for tonight. I don't

normally dress like this.

SHARON

It's adorable.

RICHARD

Oh, I'm sorry.. Peggy Sue Kelcher,

my wife Sharon.

PEGGY

Hello. Nice to meet you. Please

call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell

now.

RICHARD

Where's Charlie? I was in town

about a year ago and caught one of

his commercials. Really made me

laugh.

PEGGY

He's not here. We're getting

divorced.

RICHARD

Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)

Mr. Norvik.

DOUG

Or, uhh, Richard?  David Snell,

Merrill Lynch.  I read about the

Cordex deal in Business Week.

Congratulations.

RICHARD

Thank you, Doug.

DOUG

Hi Peggy. How are you? How's

Char1ie?

SANDY

(gleeful)

I can't believe how she let herself

go. She was so beautiful in high

school.

CAROL

Everyone's got a gold Rolex. I had

this one specially made in

platinum.

RICHARD

...fifth generation core capacities

are going to cause another

shakeout in the smaller companies.

DRUNK MAN

(to Richard)

Your damn computers put me out of

business. You're a billionaire, and

I'm a goddamn failure.

CAROL

(chuckling)

Welcome to the singles scene.

PEGGY

I don't know how you do it. I've

never even dated anybody but

Charlie.

CAROL

You just have to remember... men

are like houses and trade

upwards... I thought you had a

pretty good marriage.

PEGGY

We did for a long time. We just got

married too young, and ended up

blaming each other for missing out

on things.

CAROL

So he started having affairs, and

you got depressed.

CAROL (CONT'D.)

You should have left here years

ago, like I did.

PEGGY

It's not the place. I don't buy

that.

(melodramatic)

Trapped in the same town forever.

The price she would pay for her

teenage lust.

CAROL

After you got knocked up, my mother

didn't want me to talk to you. She

thought it was contagious.

PEGGY

Oh, it's not so bad. I have two

wonderful kids, my own business.

(beat)

Still, knowing what I know now, if

I had the chance to do it all over

again, I'd sure do things a lot

differently.

CAROL

Wouldn't we all.

DOLORES

Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle

were high school sweethearts.

Married right after graduation,

they're still together. In this day

and age, that's remarkable...

Maddy, Arthur, how does it feel to

have missed the sexual revolution?

MADDY

(incensed)

What kind of question is that? It

has nothing to do with the reunion.

ARTHUR

(thoughtfully  into mike)

I'm glad you asked, Dolores. Four

years ago Maddy and I found

Jesus...

DOLORES

Spiritual renewal.. That's what

reunions are all about. Familiar

faces, forgotten memories, ancient

dance steps and music...the great

time machine.

CAROL

I never could keep up with you.

WALTER

(with a quick tap step)

Just call me Walter the dancing

dentist. Taps and caps. My

specialty.

ROSALIE

I remember that dress.

PEGGY

Rosalie Testa!

ROSALIE

I remember when you got that

locket, too. You were so excited

I think you showed it to the whole

school.

PEGGY

You have an incredible memory.

SHARON

It's beautiful. Does it open?

PEGGY

Yes. These are my children. But

they're not babies anymore.

ROSALIE

(laughing)

I think you got married when you

were three.

DOLORES

Carol Pritchard Heath and Walter

Getz were high school steadies who

went their separate ways. After

twenty years and four divorces

between them, they meet again

Walter a successful dentist, Carol

a mature career woman. Carol, why

did you really come back for this

reunion?

CAROL

Curiosity mostly. I heard you

finally found a man of your own.

Too bad he's married.

WALTER

(cracking up)

Whoa! Cat fight! Purse war!

DOLORES

Hello everyone. Richard Norvik? I'm

Dolores Dodge with KARP Radio.

Could I have a minute of your time?

RICHARD

Sure. I remember you.

OVERWEIGHT, BEARDED MAN

Turns out I love business. Every

morning I wake up, thank God I'm

alive, and say Who am I gonna screw

today?

LEON

Let's play "Rate the Moment". I

give tonight an eightyseven.

Better than sex, not as good as

racquetball.

WALTER

The best thing about being a

dentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade.

A couple of lines of this, I can

drill my own teeth...

(looks at her for a

moment)

Hi.

CAROL

Hi.

SERIOUS MAN

(to his wife)

Joe would have enjoyed this. God, I

still miss him.

MADDY

(to Carol)

Peggy was a mess right after they

separated, but I think she's coming

out of it... It seems to be pretty

friendly now..

CAROL

Sometimes it's easier when you hate

them.

GREASY DRUNK CREEP

I can't remember. Did I make it

with you in high school?

LISA

Doesn't it feel like it was

yesterday?

TERRY

Youth is like an amputated leg.

Long after it's gone, you still

feel it.

SAME BEARDED MAN

My wife's a cow, my son has shit

for brains, and my daughter's in

India with Mother Teresa.

WOMAN

My husband's a pig. But my son's in

social work and my daughter, God

bless her, is in India with Mother

Teresa.

LEON

For the fitness generation, we've

sure got a lot of porkers.

SANDY

I don't remember anything about the

seventies.

LISA

Breaking up was horrible. I said we

had a very special attachment, he

said, so does a Hoover.

LEON

I don't know why I came back. I

hated high school.

ROSALIE

I enjoyed it.

SHARON

Who's the one with the hair?

PEGGY

Michael Fitzsimmons. I had such a

crush on him.

CAROL

Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can

still dance.

PEGGY

Your first boyfriend. What do

you think? Any sparks left?

CAROL

Who knows. Remember...

(a beat)

Whatever Walter wants...

CAROL, PEGGY AND MADDY

(laughing)

Walter Getz.

PEGGY

Sharon Norvik this is Carol Heath,

and Maddy Nagle. My oldest and

dearest friends. Sharon's married

to Richard.

CAROL

Lucky lady. Hi.

MADDY

(looking at the photo)

Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?

PEGGY

No. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't

track him down.

CAROL.

Too bad.

SHARON

He must have been quite a guy.

PEGGY

He was the only one in high school

I wished I'd gone to bed with.

CAROL

The only one?

PEGGY

Well, besides Charlie, of course.

DISSOLVE:

SHARON

Peggy, would you please rescue

Richard? Ask him to dance.

RICHARD

Are we through Dolores? Good.

DOLORES

Well...

RICHARD

(to Sharon)

You'll be okay?

SHARON

Yes. You go ahead.

RICHARD

The only time people like Dolores

used to pay any attention to me was

to laugh at me or insult me. That

guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand

when we walked in, he used to call

me a foureyed worm.

PEGGY

Well, you showed them. You're rich

and famous and successful. And you

have a beautiful wife.

RICHARD

You were always friendly to me. I

appreciated that.

(beat)

You know, this used to be a fantasy

of mine.

PEGGY

What was?

RICHARD

Dancing with you.

PEGGY

You're a sweet man, Richard.

RICHARD

I guess part of us never really

leaves high school.

PEGGY

You know, I never told anybody

this, but I always had a feeling

that when you die, before you go to

heaven, you get a chance to fly

around high school for a while.

TERRY

Here comes the life of the party.

LEON.

I knew you couldn't stay away.

TERRY

You know, they could've at least

asked us to sing. We'd refuse, of

course, but they could've asked us.

ARTHUR

(into microphone)

Hello. Can I have your attention,

please.

ARTHUR

I know it's getting kind of late,

and some of you have a long drive

home, so the reunion committee

decided it was time for the moment

you've all been waiting for. You

don't know what you've been waiting

for because we didn't tell you, but

the committee has selected a King

and Queen. Now don't worry, I took

care of it so the band's gonna keep

playing for at least another hour,

and my old pal Judge Crystal said

that the bar can stay open as long

as we want.

ARTHUR (CONT'D.)

And while you're at it, let's have

a nice big hand for the Little Lady

that did such a great job

supervising all the decorations,

Rosalie Testa.

ARTHUR

Now back to business. The members

of the committee have given this a

lot of thought and decided on the

two people who best represent the

spirit of Buchanan High's Class of

'60. The king is someone who, in

more ways than one, has come a

long, long way since he left here.

ARTHUR

We're proud to welcome him back,

Richard Norvik! Come on up here,

King Richard!

WALTER

(kidding)

I demand a recount.

(laughs)

RICHARD

Sharon and I thank you all for

making us feel so welcome. It's

good to be back.

ARTHUR

Every king deserves a queen. Now,

we had a Lot at worthwhile

candidates. And I don't want any of

you ladies to feel left out, 'cause

you're all beautiful. But when we

sent out the invitations, we didn't

mention anything about this being a

costume party.

ARTHUR

Maybe we should have, 'cause just

looking at her brings it all back

for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I

give you our queen, Peggy Sue

Kelcher Bodell. Come on up here,

Peggy Sue.

CAROL

They're waiting. Come on.

PEGGY

(close to tears)

I can't. It's all too much.

CAROL

Go on. You can do it.

PEGGY

(into mike, overwhelmed)

Thank you.. Thank you very much.

NURSE

Would you like your Twinkie now?

CHARLIE

I vant to suck your blood. I also

vant to suck your Twinkie.

PEGGY

Charlie! Am I dead?

CHARLIE

No. You are the undead. You will

live forever if you give me your

Twinkie.

(normal voice)

Come on, let's have it. You hate

them anyway.

NURSE

Young man, stop that.

CHARLIE

Hey! I just made a deposit in your

blood bank. Now I want to make a

withdrawal.

NURSE

I think it's time for your next

class -

CHARLIE

I'm changing banks!

NURSE

Lie back down and take a deep

breath.

PEGGY

What's going on? Where am I?

NURSE

You passed out for a moment.

Nothing to worry about.

PEGGY

How did I get here?

NURSE

Why don't you let your friends help

you?

(to Maddy and Carol)

Take her into the washroom and

splash some cold water on her face.

That should perk her up.

MADDY

Yes, ma' am.

CAROL

(to Peggy)

Wanna smoke?

PEGGY

No thanks. I gave them up years

ago.

PEGGY

Where is it?

CAROL

Were taking you back to the nurse.

PEGGY

Maddy, what did you do to your

hair?

CAROL

We're going to take you home.

PEGGY

That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember

the way.

CAROL

I'll call you Later.

PEGGY

Yes. Let's stay in touch.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Who is it?

PEGGY

Peggy.

(shuddering)

Peggy Sue.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.5.)

Come on in. It's open.

PEGGY

(helplessly)

Mom!

MRS. KELCHER

The nurse called and said you'd be

coming home.

PEGGY

I have a note.

MRS. KELCHER

How do you feel?

PEGGY

I'm excused.

MRS. KELCHER

Why don't you go lie down for a

while.

PEGGY

Mom!

PEGGY

Chanel Number Five. That always

reminds me of home.

MRS. KELCHER

Of course, dear. You're home now.

PEGGY

I'm home now.

PEGGY

Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone

here?

PEGGY

No. This is crazy. Is somebody

going to tell me what's going on?

Why me? What happened? You don't

have to show up. I don't have to

see you. Just send me a sign.

(beat)

Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my

own.

PEGGY

Nancy! Come here.

NANCY

What are you doing?

PEGGY

I'm just happy to see you.

NANCY

Come on! Mom said you were sick.

You're never happy to see me.

PEGGY

I'm sorry about that. I really want

us to be closer. I have enough

unresolved relationships in my...

life.

NANCY

Teenagers are weird. And you're the

weirdest.

PEGGY

Let's do something together.. Do

you want to play Monopoly? Or

Careers... Clue... Snakes and

Ladders?

NANCY

(suspicious)

Okay, what do you want? What dumb

favor do you want me to do?

PEGGY

It's unbelievable. The man never

ages.

NANCY

Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he

dreamy? I wish he'd break up with

Arlene. She thinks she's so great.

PEGGY

Don't eat the red ones.

NANCY

Why not? They're my favorite.

PEGGY

They're bad for you. They

cause...red lips. (red dye *2)

PEGGY

Can't hurt. I'm already dead.

NANCY (Q.S.)

Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian!

MRS. KELCHER

(from the kitchen)

I put your laundry on your beds.

Don't forget to put it away.

NANCY

What's for dinner?

MRS. KELCHER

Meatloaf.

NANCY

Yeech, not again.

MR. KELCHER

Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing

outside?

MRS. KELCHER

What is it?

MR. KELCHER

What do you think?

MRS  KELCHER

(disturbed)

Oh, Jack.

NANCY

Like wow! Wait till I tell Diane.

She's always bragging about her

father's Cadillac.

MR. KELCHER

Peggy Sue, what do you think?

PEGGY

Oh, Daddy. You were always

doing things like that.

(cracking up)

That's funny! That's really funny.

MR. KELCHER

Young lady, you're drunk!

PEGGY

(laughing)

Just a little. I've had a tough

day.

MR. KELCHER

I don't see the humor in this. Go

to your room immediately. You're

grounded.

PEGGY

(tipsy)

Grounded? Ha! The story of my life.

I don't wanna go to my room. I

wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna

go to Liverpool and discover the

Beatles.

MRS. KELCHER

Jack, take it easy. She gave blood

at school today. Maybe she's just a

little lightheaded.

MR. KELCHER

This is not giving blood. This is

drunk.

PEGGY

Dad, I never knew you had a sense

of humor.

MR. KELCHER

Evelyn, put her to bed.

MRS. KELCHER

My little baby. Don't try to grow

up so fast.

PEGGY

Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so

young.

MRS. KELCHER (O.S.)

A new car. We can't afford a new

car.

MR. KELCHER (O.S.)

Don't worry, it's just a seasonal

slump.

MRS. KELCHER (O.S.)

You have four seasons, you have

four slumps.

PEGGY

Let's get physical!... Let's get

metaphysical!

PEGGY

Good morning.

NANCY

Can I borrow this sweater?

PEGGY~

Yeah, but take good care of it.	I'm

saving it for my daughter.. She

loves this stuff.

MRS. KELCHER

What happened to your hair? You

have such a pretty face. Why are

you always trying to cover it up?

PEGGY

Oh. I forgot.

MRS. KELCHER

You're looking pretty chipper this

morning.

PEGGY

I'm still here, aren't I?

I may as well enjoy myself.

I'm going to go to school

today.

(beat)

Dad, I want to apologize for

yesterday. The car is a classic.

Use it in the best of health.

MR. KELCHER

Thank you.. I accept your

apology with the hope that what

went on yesterday will never

happen again.

PEGGY

That would be impossible.

MR. KELCHER

You're so young, this is not the

time to start acquiring bad habits.

PEGGY

Mom, is there any coffee left?

MRS. KELCHER

When did you start drinking coffee?

PEGGY

Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids

drink it.

MR. KELCHER

If all the kids jumped off a

bridge, would you do that too?

PEGGY

I think I'm way ahead of them.

NANCY

Pass the toast, please.

NANCY

And the butter.

PEGGY

You know, you two are wonderful

parents. I'm really going to try to

behave myself.

MR. KELCHER

Well, at least you stopped calling

me DaddyO.

NANCY

(correcting him)

DADDYo.

PEGGY

Mom, sit down for a minute. This is

so nice, all of us being together

again like this.

NANCY

Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got

drunk or is that a deep family

secret?

(silence)

Well?

MRS. KELCHER

How does Diane like her braces?

R31.NCY

She hates them. Nobody likes

braces. Thy just call you junkyard

face and Miss Metal Mouth. I gotta

go.

a fivenote musical phrase  BEBOPALUBOP.

PEGGY

Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to

handle him?

MRS. KELCHER

What's the matter? Did you two

have a fight?.

PEGGY

Sort of.

MRS. KELCHER

What about?

PEGGY

The house payments.

CHARLIE

How do you feel?

PEGGY

Pretty strange.

CHARLIE

Come on. Get in. I can take care of

that.

PEGGY

Not now, Charlie. I've got a

headache. Get used to the word.

Roll it around your tongue for a

years.

CHARLIE

Hey, I can take a hint. You look

great today.

PEGGY

You drive like a maniac!

CHARLIE

I call this the staccato.

(does tricks)

CHARLIE

(earnest)

Not that I'm glad you were sick,

but I had a chance to do some

thinking last night.

PEGGY

Oh yeah?

CHARLIE

You know. About what we said on

Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.

PEGGY

Refresh my memory.

CHARLIE

How could you forget? We talk about

seeing other people and you forget?

PEGGY

Maybe I blocked it out.

CHARLIE

I can understand that.. But please

don't start crying again.

CHARLIE

It's not going to be forever. I

figure three years is long enough.

I can see it the music pans out.

(more tentative)

And right after graduation we

should start seeing other people.

Kind of comparison shop before we

settle down and get married. Know

what I mean?

PEGGY

Why wait?

CHARLIE

(surprised)

Well, we got the prom coming up,

all these parties. We shouldn't

upset our parents?

PEGGY

They'll learn to live with it.

CHARLIE

You're more shook up than you want

to admit. You'll get used to it,

we'll still see each other 2, 3

times a week.

CHARLIE

Want me to drive you home later?

PEGGY

Would you?

CHARLIE

(growling)

Would I?!! Why I oughta...

MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

Good morning, students. This is Mr.

Mosey. Our girls diving team is

competing today in the county

finals at Commander Beck High

School.

We know they'll put forth a

splendid effort  so let's wish

them luck.

PEGGY

Where's Rosalie Testa?

CAROL

Probably at the diving meet.

MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

Finally, congratulations go to

Richard Norvik for placing first in

the Statewide Math Contest. We're

proud of you, Richard....That's

all, students.

DOLORES

Did you study for the test?

PEGGY

(horrified)

Test?

SNELGROVE

All right, class. Time's up.

SNELGROVE

What's the meaning of this, Peggy

Sue?

PEGGY

(patiently)

Mr. Snelgrove, I happen to know

that in the future, I will never

have the slightest use for algebra.

And I speak from experience.

MICHAEL

Santiago comes back, with nothing

there's no meat on the bone. It's

Hemingway's ego defending itself

again; he's trying to prove he can

still perform.

GILFOND

...What Hemingway's saying,

Michael, is that we are alone

that when we go out too far we're

vulnerable. The irony, that

Santiago is beaten by the sharks,

doesn't make him less of a hero.

GILFOND

Over the weekend read the first

four chapters of The Great Gatsbv.

I hope you enjoy it.

PEGGY

Mr. Gilfond, can I talk to you?

GILFOND

Sure, Peggy Sue. What's on your

mind?

PEGGY

I just wanted to tell you how much

I enjoy your class. You taught me a

lot and... you're a very fine

teacher.

GILFOND

That's very kind of you. Thank you.

PEGGY

Thank you. Um, I also think you're

underpaid.

WALTER

Why does your father take inventory

on Sunday night? That's poker

night. You always got out of it

before.

CHARLIE

I've got to string him along for a

while. It's for his own good.

ARTHUR

But you're not going into his

business. When're you going to tell

him?

CHARLIE

Soon. I can't tall everybody

everything all at once.

WALTER

Strange rumors are sweeping the

school about you.

PEGGY

(wary)

What do you mean?

WALTER

Prom what I hear, you really gave

it to old Smellgrove.

MADDY

I was there. She told the creep off

right to his face.

ARTHUR

Atta girl, Peg.

PEGGY

Arthur, please don't call me Peg.

ARTHUR

Why I oughta...

PEGGY

I don't get it.

CAROL

That's because you' re not a total

moron like they are.

MADDY

It's some stupid old movie thing

they just started.

WALTER

That's enough out of you, little

lady.

CHARLIE

I'll throw the book at you!

ARTHUR

Why I oughta...

PEGGY

I'll be right back.

WALTER

She's not wasting any time. Peggy

Sue and Mr. Square Root?

CHARLIE

He's a nice guy. You know he's

writing a book?

WALTER

Oh, a book... Excuse me for a

second.

(fakes gagging)

PEGGY

Congratulations on the math

contest, Richard.

RICHARD

It really wasn't that difficult.

DOUG

What're you doing, Peggy Sue?

Fishing for foureyed worms?

PEGGY

Get lost you macho shmuck.

PEGGY

I have to talk to you. It's very

important.

RICHARD

I'm not doing any tutoring this

year. I'm too busy.

PEGGY

It's not that. Can we meet after

school? Please?

RICHARD

All right. I'll be in the physics

lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a

rocket club meeting.

MADDY

Therefore, the key to a successful

children's party can be summed up

in one word  planning.. With

proper planning, a successful,

inexpensive happy birthday party

can be had by all. Including the

mother.

MISS OTTO

That was very comprehensive,

Madeline. Thank you.. Now...

(beat)

Peggy Sue, your topic was 'How To

Choose A Nursery School.' Are you

prepared?

PEGGY

All.... Okay. Sure.

PEGGY

Choosing a good nursery school can

be one of the most important

decisions you can make. It will

often determine your child's

attitude towards education and

schooling.

(proud of herself)

Of course, the lessons learned are

primarily social  sharing, being

considerate of others.

(remembering)

And they're so cute when they're

little. They bring you back their

Little masterpieces every day and

you put 'em on the refrigerator

door. They're so proud, and their

names are all misspelled. Scott

would always print his S backwards,

and Beth would make her sweet

little flowers...

DOLORES

(to Peggy)

What a girl. What a twirl. You

know, PegLeggy, you're gonna get

demoted to hall monitor -

HEAD MAJORETTE

Come on, Peggy Sue.. Try it again.

You haven't been practicing.

CHARLIE

Looking good out there.

PEGGY

Thanks.

CHARLIE

I noticed you were giving me the

silent treatment at lunch. I guess

I deserved it. I've been thinking

about my three year plan and I

think it's unworkable. I must have

been delirious.

PEGGY

I thought it had a lot of merit.

CHARLIE

In the abstract maybe. Get a grip

on yourself! But when I imagine you

going out with other guys, I

feel... ah...

PEGGY

Rejected, worthless, miserable.

CHARLIE

Yeah. Like that.

PEGGY

Good.

PEGGY

What a great kite.

RICHARD

I'm writing a book on kite

construction. What did you want to

talk about?

PEGGY

I want to ask you a question.

(beat)

Do you think...time travel is

possible?

RICHARD

Are you doing some kind of science

project?

PEGGY

Sort of.

RICHARD

Well... in a Newtonian framework,

the possibilities were limited, but

with the advent of relativity

theory, the idea of absolute time

can no longer be reasonably

affirmed.

RICHARD

And then, there's Richard's

Burrito.

PEGGY

What's that?

RICHARD

That's my own theory based on a

Mexican food called the burrito.

I had it once when my parents took

me to Disneyland.

PEGGY

I	know what a burrito is.

RICHARD

Well, I think time is like a

burrito. Sometimes it just folds

over on itself and one part touches

the other.

PEGGY

What's inside?

RICHARD

You can till it with whatever you

want. From illusions to memory,

from experience to innocence, from

happiness to the entire universes

PEGGY

So you think time travel is

possible? For people?

RICHARD

Absolutely. People, dogs,

elephants.

PEGGY

Listen, you've gotta keep this a

secret. You can't tell a soul.

Promise?

RICHARD

Okay. I promise.

PEGGY

This is serious. Nobody can know.

Ah, I've returned from the future.

I traveled back here 25 years.

RICHARD

You probably are crazy. Wait a

minute. Is this some kind of joke?

I know what you all, think of me.

PEGGY.

No. Really. You're the smartest

person I know. It sounds

unbelievable. But I can prove it.

RICHARD

Oh yeah?

PEGGY

You have a blind grandfather. One

day you're going to invent a

machine that reads books for blind

people. I read about it. You're

going to be famous. You're going to

invent a lot of things.

RICHARD

How, did you know about my

grandfather?

PEGGY

Because I'm telling you the truth.

I know what's going to happen.

There's going to be test tube

babies and heart transplants. And

an American named Neil Armstrong is

going to walk on the moon. On July

20, 1969.

RICHARD

Holy Toledo! That's six years

ahead of schedule!

RICHARD

But when did you leave? Are you

here until then? Were you there

until now? What direction are you

going in? Are you a moving point on

an infinite line extending into the

past? Can anyone do it?

PEGGY

I don't know.

RICHARD

I'd be very careful if I were you.

You don' t want to fall into the

clutches of some madman with plans

to manipulate your brain.

PEGGY

That's why I was getting a

divorce..

(beat)

What I really think is that I had a

heart attack at the reunion and

died.

RICHARD

You look pretty good for a corpse.

PEGGY

Come on, Richard, I'm serious.

RICHARD

You're giving me the creeps.

PEGGY

Am I dead or not?

RICHARD

There's one way to find out.

PEGGY

What're you doing?

RICHARD

Confucious says, The way out is

through the door. There's a truck.

There's your door.

RICHARD

Step in front of the truck! If

you're dead, it won't matter. The

truck'll go right through you. Go

ahead! You're dead!

PEGGY

No! I don't want to die!

RICHARD

Okay, you're not dead, but

according to every law of science

what you say happened to you is

impossible.

PEGGY

What if it's beyond science? What

it it's God?

RI CHARD

Einstein said "God doesn't play

dice with the universe." I'm a

scientist. I believe that there's

an order to things. Why would God

bring you back as a high school

girl?

PEGGY

I don't know.

RICHARD

You're a molecule in chaos, a

discontinuent aberration. Maybe

you've just got powers of

precognition. Well, maybe you're

just out of whack.

PEGGY

I told you, I've already lived my

life. I don't know how or why I'm

here, but you have to help me get

back. I want to get back to my real

life!

RICHARD

All right, I'll work on it, I'll,

do some research. But in the

meantime, don't get crazy.

PEGGY

I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.

(heads out the door)

RICHARD

What if you're not here tomorrow?

MRS. KELCHER (O.S.)

This necklace is sapphire, it was

my Grandmother's.

PEGGY

Who was that man?

MRS. KELCHER

It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll,

taker. I'm thinking of voting

Democrat this year. But don't

mention it to your father. How was

school today?

PEGGY

It was great to see everybody

again. But it's so boring and

regimented. Most of what they teach

is useless. The worst thing was

lunch.

MRS. KELCHER

Would you get that, dear?

PEGGY

Sure, Mom.

(picking up the phone)

Hello.

MRS. KELCHER

Peggy! What's the matter? Who is

it?

PEGGY

(shaken)

It's Grandma. I can't talk to her

now.

(into phone)

I'm sorry, Grandma.

MRS. KELCHER (O.S.)

Peggy Sue! What is it?

MRS. KELCHER

What happened to you?

PEGGY

I had a dream that Grandma died.

MRS. KELCHER

Well, she is getting on, but she's

fine. I told her you weren't

feeling well yesterday. She called

to find out how you are.

PEGGY

She did? I love her so much, and I

haven't seen her in such a long

time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he

all, right?

MRS. KELCHER

Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them

at Easter.

PEGGY

I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma

back and apologize.

MRS. KELCHER

That's a good girl... I hate to see

you so upset.

(beat)

Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having

problems with Charlie? You

mentioned something this morning.

PEGGY

I'm confused about a lot of things

right now. Charlie's only one of

them.

MRS. KELCHER

Is Charlie pressuring you to do

things you don't think you should

be doing?

PEGGY

What do you mean?

MRS. KELCHER

Peggy, do you know what a penis is?

(Peggy's jaw drops)

Stay away from it.

MR. KELCHER

Hello, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Hello, sir. How are things at the

hat store?

MR. KELCHER

Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to

talk to you.

MR. KELCHER

You may have noticed that Peggy

Sue's been acting a little strange

lately.

NANCY

She's distorted.

CHARLIE

Yes, sir.

MR. KELCHER

She seems confused, irresponsible,

overemotional. My wife says that's

the way girls act sometimes.

NANCY

She's almost a juvenile delinquent.

CHARLIE

Yes, sir. But that's what I like

about her. She's not like all the

other girls at school.

MR. KELCHER

Charles, in spite of your

adolescent infatuation with music,

we've always regarded you a a fine

young man. We've trusted you with

our daughter.

CHARLIE

Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway

street. In the past two years I've

been pleased to note that you and

Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled

your sacred trust of being good

parents to the, uh, woman I plan to

take off your hands.

PEGGY

(worrying)

Oh, Beth.

MRS. KELCHER

Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't

you ready?

PEGGY

For what?

MRS. KELCHER

Maddy's party.

PEGGY

I don't feel very festive.

MRS. KELCHER

You accepted an invitation, Maddy's

one of your best friends, and I

baked the Rice Krispie squares.

MRS. KELCHER

Enjoy yourself! This is the best

time of your life. And the sooner

you learn to handle Charlie the

better. Get dressed.

MR. KELCHER

We think this party might cheer

her up. Just make sure you know

what's expected of you.

CHARLIE

What would that be, sir?

MR. KELCHER

Show her a good time, but for God's

sake restrain yourself.

CHARLIE

(surprised)

Of course.

PEGGY

Where did you get that sweater?

CHARLIE

Great, isn't it?

PEGGY

It's really Fifties. You sort of

clash with the world.

CHARLIE

Hey! What's the fun of being a

teenager if you can't dress weird?

And we're going to have fun

tonight, right?

PEGGY

Right. I promised my mother.

CHARLIE

Is this slow enough for you?

PEGGY

(serious)

Charlie, how are you?

CHARLIE

I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are

you? Are we talking on the phone?

Are we pen pals?

PEGGY

Seriously. What's it like to be

eighteen?

CHARLIE

It's great. I cleaned the car, do

you like it? Oh, I got tickets for

Fabian on your birthday, you like

him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is

half of thirty six. It's "Gentlemen

start your engines", vroom, like

I'm gassed up ready for the race.

I've got the girl, I've got the

car, I've got the talent, but I

don't know. Do I date, get married,

join the army, cut a record, go to

college? I got a million choices,

but nobody teaches you how to

choose. But it's different for a

girl. You're Lucky. You just have

to wait for me.

DOUG

Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn

it, dad blame it.

CHARLIE

Here comes the life of the party.

LEON

Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what

the cat dragged in.

CHARLIE

Have no fear. Charlie's here.

WALTER

Oh, it's you is it.

TERRY

Jumping Jehosophat!

DOUG

It's a miracle!

PEGGY

Hi, guys.

ARTHUR

Now that's a purty little heifer.

CHARLIE

Why Pete's the best darn cook on

the Panhandle!

PEGGY

Why I oughta!

CHARLIE

Ready. Set. Go -

ARTHUR

(going: for speed)

HiYo Silver! A cloud of dust, a

galloping horse with the speed of

light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The

Lone Ranger! With his faithful

Indian companion Tonto, the daring

and resourceful Masked Rider of the

Plains came to Earth with powers-

and abilities far beyond those of

mortal men.

Return with us now to those

thrilling days of yesteryear - from

out of the...

LEON

You doorknob! You threw in

Superman!

CHARLIE

Too bad. Close to a record.

ARTHUR

(foaming at the nose)

I hate it when the beer comes out

my nose.

MADDY

Can you believe I want to marry

that dork.

CAROL

Why do guys do such stupid things?

PEGGY

You know, I never could figure that

one out.

MADDY

I was thinking of four ushers and

four bridesmaids.

WALTER

The Yanks got the hitting but the

Sox got the defense.

CAROL

What are your colors, going to be?

ARTHUR

I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson

over Fox and Aparicio.

MADDY

I'm thinking of pink and green.

MADDY (CONT'D.)

Look at Dolores. What a tramp.

CHARLIE

Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers

got four potential twenty game

winners.

CAROL

You'd be surprised at how many

girls in school aren't virgins.

WALTER AND ARTHUR

(to Carol)

Like who?

CHARLIE

Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning

and Paul Foytack.

ARTHUR

And now, direct from three weeks of

rehearsal in Walter's garage, four

guys who have dedicated their lives

to becoming the greatest singing

group in the world... (beat)

Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry.

The Definitions.

CHARLIE

One, two, three-...

CAROL

Charlie really has a great voice.

MADDY

Maybe they'll be the next Dion and

the Belmonts.

PEGGY

Don't get your hopes up.

MADDY

Come on, where's your enthusiasm?

PEGGY

He is kind of cute, isn't he?

CAROL

Yeah. You're so lucky. He really

loves you, too. He's always telling

Walter how wonderful you are.

PEGGY

He does?

DOLORES

Carol and I saw you with that

creep, Richard, today.

PEGGY

First of all, Richard is not a

creep. He happens to be an

exceptional person. If any of you

gave him half a chance, you'd find

that out.

DOLORES

God, Peggy, you're so unformed

you're practically fetal. You're

just taking pity on him 'cause he

has no friends.

PEGGY

Dolores, can't you be a little

kinder to people? You don't even

know the boy. If you weren't so

neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd

shut up for a while and show some

compassion.

DOLORES

Are you for real?

PEGGY

Touchy, touchy!

MADDY

(to Peggy)

I don't know what you said to her,

but I wish I'd said it.

PEGGY

Charlie, what do you think of

Richard Norvik?

CHARLIE

Is he gonna help you with that

physics stuff?

PEGGY

He's trying.

CHARLIE

Hey! Who needs physics when

we've got chemistry?

PEGGY

(charmed)

Come on, let's dance.

WALTER

Put on some makeout music, and

kill the lights.

CHARLIE

There isn't a girl in school that

can hold a candle to you..

PEGGY

You're pretty charming when you

want to be.

CHARLIE

Yeah I know.  But I don't have to

flatter you.  It just feels right.

You're the perfect girl for me.  As

in is, was and always will be.  I'm

glad dancing was invented.  You

know the first dances were rituals.

Like fertility rites.

DOLORES

Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy

make it up?  I've never seen that

on Bandstand.

TERRY

What if we're witnessing the end of

touch dancing?

PEGGY

Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved

the way you kiss.  I missed you.

CHARLIE

Your eyes look like silver pools of

moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.

PEGGY

You really love me, don't you?

CHARLIE

You know I do.  I even wrote you

into my will.

PEGGY

(tentatively)

Charlie, let's make love.

CHARLIE

What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?

(nonbelieving)

You want to have intercourse! Last

weekend you said... What time is

it?

PEGGY

A lot's happened since last

weekend.

CHARLIE

But you're the one who wanted to

wait till we got married. And you

were right. We should wait.

PEGGY

(f1ustered)

I probably meant it when I said it.

(beat; coyly)

Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come

out?

CHARLIE

Who?

PEGGY

You know. Your love machine... the

throbbing thrill hammer... your

thing!

CHARLIE

You mean my wang? Listen, it's

running real late.

CHARLIE

What is this? What the hell is

going on? One week you say, "If you

love me you won't", now you say "If

you love me you will".

(beat)

Excuse me. That's a guy's line!

PEGGY

This is a mistake. We better

forget it.

CHARLIE

You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy!

You sure know how to spoil a mood.

PEGGY

I'm sorry Charlie.

CHARLIE

Save it.

MONICA

What would you like?

PEGGY

Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines?

MONICA

Yes. Who are you?

PEGGY

Ah... never mind. Can I have a

coffee, please? And a cinnamon

cruller.

(sotto)

How's Bobo?

MONICA

Twenty cents, please.

PEGGY

You're kidding?

PEGGY

I was impressed with what you said

in English class today.

MICHAEL

Gilfond's okay, except he thinks

Hemingway's great Literature.

PEGGY

You don't?

MICHAEL

(contemptuously)

He's a fisherman! The most

overrated writer of the century. I

mean, he's the perfect American

author  fat, violent, drunk...

PEGGY

Maybe you're confusing his life

with his work.

MICHAEL

A writer's life is his work. Jack

Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull

to have something to write about.

He's out there feeling, burning...

grooving on life!

PEGGY

The young man leaned back in his

chair. No bulls would die today.

MICHAEL

What're you doing here anyway?

PEGGY

Coffee and a donut.

MICHAEL

I thought chicks like you traveled

in packs.

PEGGY

Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.

DOLORES

Terry, slow down.

TERRY

Okay.

DOLORES

Terry! Slow down.

TERRY

What, why?

DOLORES

There's Peggy with Michael

Fitzsimmons.

TERRY

That commie beatnik? What's she

doing with him? Wait'll I tell

Charlie.

DOLORES

First a nerd and then a weirdo.

What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll

tell Charlie.

MICHAEL

This is great reefer.

PEGGY

Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really

old... (inhales) Travels well

though.

(beat)

You know, the world looks a lot

better from up here.

MICHAEL

The world is fantastic. It's the

ultimate absurd circus. I am shot

from a cannon into the energy.

PEGGY

What are you shooting for?

MICHAEL

Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't

wait to get out of here. I'm gonna

write. I'm gonna check out of this

bourgeois motel. Push myself away

from the dinner table and say 'No

more JellO for me, Mom.'

PEGGY

Don't you get along with your

parents?

MICHAEL

The only thing my father digs is

cold, green money. All my mother

cares about is her standing at the

country club.

PEGGY

They care about you. They're just a

different generation.

MICHAEL

Hey what's with you? I thought you

were cool. You rode my bike. You

blew some pot.

(beat)

What's your scene Miss Majorette?

You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and

graze around with all the other

sheep for the rest of your life?

PEGGY

I already did that. I want to be a

dancer, I want to dance.

MICHAEL

You know, I had you pegged all

wrong.

MICHAEL

A ray of oneness piercing the

solitude. Falling bodies in the

ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a

chapter in my memoirs of desire.

PEGGY

Is that one of your poems?

MICHAEL

No, I just made that up. Do

you want to hear one?

PEGGY

I'd love to.

MICHAEL

(eyes ablaze)

Okay. Here's a new one. It's called

Tenderness.

(beat)

I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd

scream

Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of

bitterness.

In the madhouse of Dr. Dread

Razor shreds of rat puke fall

On my bare arms

(sees Peggy grimace; he

calms down)

I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to

impress you.

(kisses her)

PEGGY

Michael... you're as good as you

looked.

MICHAEL

I'll respect you for eternity.

(reciting tenderly)

'When you are old and gray, and

full of sleep, And nodding by the

fire, Take down this book, and

slowly read, And dream of the soft

look your eyes had once."

(beat)

I didn't write that. That's Yeats.

PEGGY

I envy you. You have your whole

life ahead of you and you know

exactly what you want to do.

(beat)

But forget the rat puke; write

something beautiful.

PEGGY

You know, this isn't really

happening.

MILKMAN

Your parents are waiting up. You

know, I see a lot of this in the

spring. Good luck.

PEGGY

Thanks, Ralph.

MRS. KELCHER

Where have you been?

PEGGY

I went for a drive. Up in the

hills.

MR. KELCHER

Damn that Charlie I

PEGGY

It's not Charlie. It's me.

MR. KELCHER

(nervously)

Peggy, let me ask you something.

(beat)

You're not... expecting are you?

PEGGY

At my age? Don't be silly.

MR. KELCHER

Thank God for that.

PEGGY

Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't

you ever stay out all night when

you were young?

MR. KELCHER

Yes but I was a boy. And I still

had hell to pay.

PEGGY

Calm down. Just listen for a

minute.. Please.

MR. KELCHER

All right. But this better be good.

PEGGY

I want to help with the family

finances. I want you to buy some

stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is

going to be worth eight hundred

dollars an ounce. Then you sell.

MR. KELCHER

Do you know how ridiculous you

sound? First of all, it's illegal

for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And

in the second place, the price of

gold is regulated by the

government.

PEGGY

I think they're going to deregulate

it.

MR. KELCHER

That's your problems The more women

think, the more trouble they get

into.

PEGGY

Oh boy, that's another thing that's

going to change. Who's going to

think for us? Our husbands? You

know, you treat Mom like a maid.

It's not entirely your fault. Those

were the attitudes in the fifties,

and that's the way you raised me.

But give Nancy a break, encourage

her to go to art school.

MR. KELCHER

I've heard just about enough of

this lunacy! Go to your room!

PEGGY

Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy

Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No,

no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!

MR. KELCHER

Evelyn, take her to her room!

MRS. KELCHER

I'm not the maid!

PEGGY

Way to go, Mom!

RICHARD

The way I see it, you have an

unparalleled opportunity to become

the richest woman in the world.

PEGGY

I'm just not the type. Besides, I

want to get out of here.

RICHARD

But you have a vision. Don't you

want to help your parents?

PEGGY

I tried to tell them, but they

wouldn't listen to me.

RICHARD

I'm talking about invention, no

investment. I know what people

think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick

the Square Root. I'll show them.

You said I was going to be a

millionaire. And you're gonna help!

PEGGY

Richard, take it easy.

RICHARD

No offense, but for a person who

says she's lived an extra lifetime,

you certainly are thick. Money is

power.. Money makes people respect

you...

PEGGY

How come you never ask me any

important questions? Don't you

wonder if there's going to be a

nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer?

What about your family? What about

people?

RICHARD

I'm curious, but I don't want to

know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been

telling people what's going to

happen to them.

PEGGY

Give me some credit, will you?

RICHARD

Good. You're discreet. I like that

in a partner.

PEGGY

Wbat're you talking about?

RICHARD

Look it's very simple. You tell me

everything that hasn't been

invented yet, and I'll invent it.

We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.

PEGGY

Sixtyforty.

RI CHARD

That's not fair.

PEGGY

Okay, find yourself another vision.

RICHARD

You're taking advantage of a minor.

PEGGY

When do we start?

WAITRESS

Do you know what you want?

RICHARD

A Ton on a Bun, with fries.

WAITRESS

And you?

PEGGY

Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and

a Perrier.

PEGGY

Dry cleaners. No real change. Just

higher prices.

PEGGY

Ah. This is a biggie. Forget

sneakers. Running shoes, jogging

shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two

hundred dollars a pair.

RICHARD

Come on. You can't be serious.

PEGGY

There are major fortunes to be made

here. Leisure time and lifestyles.

RICHARD

Are you talking ~about exercise?

Like gym?

PEGGY

Not for you. Okay, there's lots

more.

PEGGY

Look at that stuff. It's like the

dark ages. This is more your speed.

And boy, do I know this business.

RICHARD

Let's see...

(looking around)

icrowavemays, ocketpay

alculatorcays...

PEGGY

You don't have to use pig Latin!

Nobody could possibly know what

we're talking about.

RICHARD

All right. These are the choices:

microwave ovens, pocket

calculators, Walkmans, digital

watches and miniature TV's.

PEGGY

Oh.	And huge portable radios.

Everything else gets small, but for

some reason, portable radios get

enormous.

PEGGY

I'll be right back.

PEGGY

Richard! They don't have any! They

never heard of them! Isn't that

wonderful?

RICHARD

What are you talking about?

PEGGY

The wave of the future! I've

decided on our first fortune! I'll

see you later. You just think high

tech.

RICHARD

High tech. I like the sound of

that.

MR. BODELL

(to young woman)

Look at that freezer chest. What

capacity.

(to Peggy, embarrassed)

Hello Peggy Sue.

PEGGY

Woody! How ya doing?

MR. BODELL

Fine, just fine.

PEGGY

Nice to see you.

MR. BODELL

Charlie's in the back.

MR. BODELL

My future daughterinlaw. Very

affectionate girl.

GENTLEMAN

I'll just take the Ravel.

CHARLIE

Take the Shostakovich home and

listen to it. Let it grow on you.

Everyone that's bought it has come

back and said, "This is definitive

Shostakovich. Thank you for

encouraging me to investigate it."

GENTLEMAN

Well, I did enjoy the Dvorak you

suggested. Young man, you talked me

into it.

CHARLIE

You'll like it. I kid you not.

PEGGY

What do you know about classical

music?

CHARLIE

Nothing.. Selling is selling.

PEGGY

Charlie. About last nights..

CHARLIE

Forget it. I've been thinking.

Girls must go through that stuff

too. Sometimes when I look at you I

feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's

right. Teenagers are nuts.

PEGGY

But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with

a lifetime of emotional experiences

you couldn't possibly understand.

CHARLIE

Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster

than guys. But last night, I was

the one who put on the brakes. And

you know why?

PEGGY

Why?

CHARLIE

Because nothing else matters.

That's the great thing about love.

Every time we argue, every time

something goes wrong, and I know

that I'm not perfect either, things

just work out better in the end.

Cause you're my baby and I love

you.

PEGGY

What am I going to do with you?

CHARLIE

Don't be cruel to a heart that's

true.

PEGGY

Hi, Dad.

MR. KELCHER

Doing some shopping?

MR. KELCHER

For me?

PEGGY

Open it.

MR. KELCHER

Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But

they must've been expensive.

PEGGY

I closed my Christmas club.

MR. KELCHER

Good, you got your money out of

that greedy bank.

PEGGY

I wanted to apologize for this

morning.

MR. KELCHER

It's hard to believe you're going

to be eighteen.

(looks out the window)

Want an eskimo pie? Or a

creamsicle?

I'd come home from the store and

there's little you running up to

me. I'd give you a dime and you'd

promise never to grow up.

PEGGY

Quiet today?

MR. KELCHER

This morning was good.

PEGGY

The hat business is in trouble.

MR. KELCHER

I, that what all that nonsense was

about this morning? You're worried

about my business?

PEGGY

Yes.

MR. KELCHER

That's very thoughtful, honey. It's

just a slump. Things will pick up.

PEGGY

But when John F. Kennedy's elected

President, men'1l stop wearing

hats.

MR. KELCHER

Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never

win.

PEGGY

(gravely; closing her

eyes)

He'll win.

MR. KELCHER

Richard Nixon's going to be

President. Nixon wears hats.

NANCY

You think this'll cheer Dad up?

PEGGY

Of course, he'll love it. You're a

terrific artist.

MR. KELCHER (O.S.)

I don't need your charity. I don't

need your grandmother's jewelry or

your parents money -how could you

do that?

MRS. KELCHER

Please don't shout.

MR. KELCHER (O.S.)

I'm not shouting. Have we ever

starved? Have we ever missed a

mea1?

MRS. KELCHER

Does everybody have to hear?

MR. KELCHER

I want everybody to hear because I

don't have anything to be ashamed

of.

MRS. KELCHER

Jack, I was just trying to help.

MR. KELCHER

We'll make it, we'll be fine.

NANCY

Does this mean we're going to be

poor?

CAROL

All right. What's the scoop?

PEGGY

On what?

MADDY

How come we're your best friends

and we had to find out about you

and Michael Fitzsimmons from

Dolores?

PEGGY

She's unbelievable. Who needs

satellites when we've got Dolores's

mouth?

CAROL

I hear she does more than talk with

her mouth.

MADDY

That's disgusting!

CAROL

(brushing her hair) )

Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE

WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss

as a means of genital stimulation

is widely practiced and has much to

commend it". Page eightysix.

PEGGY

Did you memorize the whole book or

only the good parts?

CAROL

Just what you underlined.

PEGGY

You're kidding...? Carol, you have

beautiful hair.

CAROL

Come on. What's with you and

Michael?

MADDY

Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.

PEGGY

He's very interesting. For all his

pretending to be a tough guy, he's

really got the soul of a poet.

CAROL

I bet Dolores told Charlie.

PEGGY

That loudmouthed little bitch~

MADDY

Peggy Sue!

CAROL

You better watch out for her. She's

after Charlie.

PEGGY

Cool it kids. He's free to see

other girls, if he wants.

MADDY

But I always thought that you would

marry Charlie, Carol would marry

Walter, and I would marry Arthur.

We'd all live on the same street

and take our kids to the park

together and have barbecues every

Sunday. It'll spoil everything if

you and Charlie break up. That

Michael doesn't look like the

barbecue type.

PEGGY

I'm not going to marry him. I just

went out with him once.

(beat)

I know! Why don't we go to the

movies tonight. Just us girls.

It'll be fun.

CAROL

Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date

night!

MADDY

Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's

picking me up soon.

PEGGY

Okay. But let's have a girls night

soon. Maybe a pajama party.

CAROL

Aren't we a little old for that?

MADDY

Sometimes you're so immature.

PEGGY

Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the

garter belt! Of course, once

they're manufactured they'll look

better than this. What do you

think?

MR. KELCHER

This is your great invention?

(to Mrs. Kelcher)

Would you wear those things?

MRS. KELCHER

Would they go over my girdle or

under?

PEGGY

Instead of a girdle. And light as a

feather.

MRS. KELCHER.

Jack, I think she's got something

there.

PEGGY

And we won't just sell them in

department stores. We'll market

them in drug stores and

supermarkets.

MR. KELCHER

That's all well and good, but we

don't have the money to manufacture

them.

PEGGY

You need a partner. There's a

friend of mine at school whose

father makes seat covers for cars,

Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him

and his family over for dinner

tomorrow night.

MRS. KELCHER

Isn't that awfully forward?

PEGGY

We've got to move fast. This is an

idea whose time has come.

MR. KELCHER

You mean to tell me that you

invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over

to talk about investing his money

in your cockamamie idea?

PEGGY

Wrong, Dad. Your idea.

PEGGY

Charlie. I just had the strangest

dream.

CHARLIE

(whispering)

I have to talk to you..

PEGGY

What are you doing here?

CHARLIE

(angry)

Let's go down to the basement.

CHARLIE

I want to know what's going on.

Dolores told me that you and that

scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...

PEGGY

I bumped into him after you dropped

me off Last night. I didn't feel

like going home, so we went for a

ride.

CHARLIE

(furious)

Then it's true, dammit! I had a

miserable time tonight 'cause of

you. When the Monotones did "Book

of Love  Chapter Four you break

up, won't you give it just one more

chance..." I'm thinking Did we

break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't

even know about it!. I thought we

cleared all that up yesterday. Did

that Maynard G. Beatnik give you

what you wanted?

PEGGY

You know I never could stand your

sarcasm.

CHARLIE

You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.

Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like

this.

PEGGY

And why do you always refer to

yourself in the third person, like

Napoleon? How come it always turns

into an argument with you?

CHARLIE

Look, I've got the hair, got the

eyes, got the teeth, I got the car.

I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.

PEGGY

Charlie,. I've been trying to

postpone this. But what's the

point? It's over.

(crying)

I don't want to hurt you. This is

very hard for me. I'm doing this

for both of us. I really want you

to be happy.

CHARLIE

I will be happy if I have you. I

love you.

PEGGY

That won't make any difference.

We just can't live together. And

you had the nerve to drive up with

that bimbo Janet.

CHARLIE

What are you talking about? Who's

Janet?

PEGGY

I just can't trust you anymore.

CHARLIE

What about everything I said to you

this afternoon...

PEGGY

That's just it. You can always get

to me. There's this window in my

heart and every time I leave it

open, you climb in. Unless I close

it now, nothing's ever going to be

different!

CHARLIE

But what has to be different?

PEGGY

Everything. I have a good head for

business, I should be franchising

the bakery. And I want you to give

me your word that whatever happens,

you'll go to college. And finish.

CHARLIE

What! What about the group and my

singing career? What about me?

PEGGY

I'm trying to save you years of

frustration... waiting for a big

break... no. Waiting for that big

disappointment so you could blame

it all on me.

CHARLIE

You don't know zip! You think I'm

going to end up selling appliances

like my father? Chasing women

around the store. I've got to give

it a shot. Why are you trying to

kill the two things that mean the

most to me? Until yesterday you

loved me and you loved us.

(opening the door) )

What the hell has changed? For two

years I've done nothing but love

you. I'll show you, I'm going to be

just like Fabian!

PEGGY

(very nervous)

Hello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue.

Much better. How are you? I'm very

sorry about the other day.

PEGGY

(breathless)

Hi, Richard.

RICHARD

What are you doing?

PEGGY

Jogging. I was running, now I'm

jogging.

RICHARD

That's what you were talking about

yesterday? Everybody does that in

the future?

PEGGY

Yep. It's going to be a law.

(beat)

I broke up with Charlie last night.

RICHARD

That's terrific. You did it. You

really changed the course of your

destiny.

PEGGY

It was an unfair fight. He didn't

have a chance. I'm taking a real

gamble. I loved him for a long,

long time.

RICHARD

Cheer up. Now you can give some

other guy a shot. Make it up to him

later and buy him a yacht.

PEGGY

For God's sake, forget the money!

I'm going crazy! I'm a walking

anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja

I'm worried about my kids, Scott

must be scared to death, I think my

daughter's doing drugs again. I

can't have any fun here, I don't

have that innocence any more. I

can't keep all this in anymore. I

feel Like I'm going to explode.

RICHARD

Look, the best scientific mind in

this country is working on your

case. May I make a suggestion?

PEGGY

Like what?

RICHARD

(excited)

Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion!

Why didn't I think o~ that before?

PEGGY

What do you know about hypnosis?

RICHARD

Everything. This is perfect. The

subconscious mind remembers all.

You can give me more information on

microchips and then pinpoint what

happened at the reunion. Maybe

that'll give us a clue on how to

get you back.

PEGGY

Look, I'm desperate. I'll try

anything. But what if you can't

snap me out of it?

RICHARD

No offense, but you're pretty out

of it now.

RICHARD

You are completely relaxed. When I

count to three, you will open your

eyes. One... two... three.

(Peggy's eyes flutter

open)

We'll start with something easy.

What is your name?

PEGGY

(trancelike)

Peggy Sue Kelcher.

(beat)

Or, Peggy Bodell.

(beat)

I'm not sure.

RICHARD

Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?

PEGGY

Ah..... they're very tiny... they

look like a fingernail made out of

an erector set...

RICHARD

What will they be made of?

PEGGY

I think it's called silicon.

Charlie told me that.

RICHARD

Silicon is from sand.

PEGGY

We were lying in the sand. It was

my eighteenth birthday... We were

so awkward... I would have married

him anyway...

RICHARD

In the future, will you have to

marry a girl before you have sex

with her?

PEGGY

No. The Pill will change all that.

Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We

were just too young.

RICHARD

You mean you'll give a girl a pill

and she'll want to have sex?

PEGGY

No. The Pill will be for birth

control. But girls do like sex.

Maybe not the first time.

RICHARD

Will you take of f your blouse?

PEGGY

Yes, every day.

(taking her blouse off

getting spaced)

Maybe I shouldn't have worn that

dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea.

That's why they made me Queen.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Richard, are you in there?

RICHARD

(shouting)

No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.

(urgent)

Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap

you out of it.

PEGGY

I couldn't help it  I loved him.

RICHARD

One... two... three.

(claps twice)

You are now awake.

PEGGY

Richard! You should be ashamed of

yourself.

RICHARD

Me? You went crazy! You started

taking your clothes off. I was

putting them back on for you.

PEGGY

That's just perfect isn't it? Did

it work? Did you find out why I

came back?

RICHARD

I think it has something to do with

your birthday. You were rambling. I

didn't understand the rest.

PEGGY

God dammit! How'm I gonna got out

of here?

RICHARD

Hey! Do you have any idea how much

those beakers cost? I usually

charge for hypnosis.

PEGGY

Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I

hear rodents put out.

MRS. KELCHER

You know, dear, I think the

pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but

the next time you come up with

something, please don't stay out

all night. Just tell us. We'll

believe you.

PEGGY

Mom, how about a machine that's

like your blender, only it slices

vegetables, kneads dough, chops

meat and even make fresh pasta?

MRS KELCHER

What's pasta?

MRS. KELCHER

These roses are beautiful. And so

romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is

he a friend of Charlie's?

PEGGY

No, just a friend of mine. I don't

think he Likes JellO.

MRS. KELCHER

What does Charlie think about that?

PEGGY

You know Mom, it's okay to have

male friends. Besides, it's over

with me and Charlie.

MRS. KELCHER

(shocked)

What? When did it happen? Your dad

and I always expected you two to

get married.

PEGGY

Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets

married. Case closed. Period. Mom,

if you could live your life over

again, would you do the same thing?

Get married and settle down after

high school?

MRS  KELCHER

Of course I loved your Lather.

I remember once being offered a

scholarship to art school. But I

turned it down.

PEGGY

Why?

MRS. KELCHER

All the college girls I knew were

so well, dressed. I was worried

that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't

have the right clothes. I was so

silly. But, I don't have many

regrets, and besides, r don't have

time to worry about the past. But

Charlie. I hope you know what

you're doing.

MR. FITZSIMMONS

Moose?  I never thought I'd have

moose for desert.

MR. KELCHER

Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner.

NANCY

But Mom helped.

MR. FITZSIMMONS

You know, you should open a

restaurant.

PEGGY

It's incredibly difficult to make

money in the restaurant business.

You have to get up at five in the

morning to go to the market, you

have problems with spoilage,

employee pilferage, and just try

and collect from the credit card

companies. They take months to pay.

MR. FITZSIMMONS

How does a young gal like you know

so much about business?

PEGGY

Oh, I just picked it up from my

dad. He's a wonderful businessman.

MR. FITZSIMMONS

Really?

MR. KELCHER

Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn

to the den for a while?

MICHAEL

That was quite an evening.

Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.

PEGGY

I shouldn't have put you through

that. It must have been agony.

Let's do something.

PEGGY

No. Something else. I'm too full.

Besides, it's a school night.

MICHAEL

Five more weeks of school. And ten

minutes past graduation I'm gone.

(he raises his glass)

To freedom.

PEGGY

(looking around at the

crowd  clinking glasses)

For everyone.

MICHAEL

Now listen, this is the plan. As

soon as school is finished we go to

Utah and...

PEGGY

Utah? I thought you'd be going to

New York or Paris. What's in Utah?

MICHAEL

Rita. I met her last summer. She's

cool. You'll really dig her. She's

got this great little cabin in the

hills, just outside of Provo where

she raises chickens. I'll write and

the two of you can take care of the

chickens to support us.

PEGGY

(astounded)

I can't do that.

MICHAEL

Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.

PEGGY

I hate chickens.

SINGER

Thank you. Now we're happy to

introduce, a friend of ours. He's

one damn fine singer, Mr. Charlie

Dell!

MICHAEL

But what about the other night? We

were like two stars in the same

constellation.

PEGGY

Michael, you and I are light years

apart. You should go, but not with

me.

MICHAEL

But we had heat baby. Passion!

Fire! We owe it to ourselves to

fuse together.

(beat)

At least one more time.

PEGGY

That's a terrific line. You're

going to be a wonderful writer.

MICHAEL

You think so?

PEGGY

Yes. We had a glorious night

together. One day you'll remember

and write about it.

MICHAEL

I can dig that. Bittersweet

perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes

of memory... yeah.

PEGGY (0.S.)

It's Charlie!

MICHAEL (0.S.)

What a treat.

MICHAEL

Now I get it.

PEGGY

Ssh. He's great.

MICHAEL

Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble

without a cause.

PEGGY

I thought I knew everything about

him.

MICHAEL

Can we split now?

MICHAEL

I can dig you being uptight about

Rita and Utah. That's cool.

But I've got to warn you about

something.

PEGGY

What?

MICHAEL

My father. He's not just the

ultimate square. He's a total

crook.

PEGGY

How did it go with the pantyhose?

MR. KELCHER

It's the darndest thing. Ed knew

what they were immediately. As a

matter of fact, he said he's got a

product like that in development

right now.

PEGGY

Oh no!

MR. KELCHER

Didn't call, them pantyhose,

though. What was it, Evelyn?

MRS. KELCHER

Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it?

Like leotards.

PEGGY

He's a liar! He has no such thing!

It's my own fault. I should have

had it patented first. He's a

crook, damnit.

MR. KELCHER

Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.

MRS. KELCHER

Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent

man.

PEGGY

Oh, you're both so naive.

MR. KELCHER

Look young lady, I grew up through

the depression. I fought in the

second World War. Six days a week I

get up and deal with the public,

the bank and the bill collectors.

And on the seventh day, when God

rests, I don't have to listen to my

daughter calling me a fool!

MRS. KELCHER

You have a point, dear.

CHARLIE

What're you doing here?

PEGGY

I wanted to talk to you, and I have

one last thing to take care of at

school. Then I'm going to...

(pats dog)

Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.

CHARLIE

Rusty's dead. That's Ajax

PEGGY

Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty

better.

(beat)

Could you give me a ride to school?

CHARLIE

Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of

commission for a while.

PEGGY

Well, how about a walk, Charlie

Bell..

CHARLIE

How'd you know about that?

PEGGY

I was at Lena's last night. You

were terrific.

CHARLIE

Not terrific enough. What were you

doing in that part of town? Who

were you with?

PEGGY

What were You doing there? You

never told me you were singing with

an R and B group.

CHARLIE

Hey. I guess there's a lot of

things we don't know about each

other.

PEGGY

I'd forgotten how much music meant

to you.

CHARLIE

That's real big of you.

PEGGY

Stop being defensive. I want to

help you. I wrote a song for you.

CHARLIE

You're kidding. You wrote a song?

Is it about a guilty girl and a

trusting guy... she wants to hurt

him, and he wonders why?

PEGGY

Not exactly, but with your great

voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

CHARLIE

Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins

came to hear me last night. He told

me to forget it. You told me to

forget it. My parents tell me to

forget it.

PEGGY

Just take a look at it.

(hands him the lyric)

CHARLIE

If you took the trouble to write

it, then sure, I'll take a look at

it. But I'm beginning to think that

maybe there's more to life than

music. I wonder if people would

still like me if I stopped being

Mr. Excitement?

CHARLIE

Does this mean you like me again?

PEGGY

It means I care about you and what

happens to you.

CHARLIE

That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause

I'm never going to give up on us.

It's easy to fall apart in a

crisis. It's easy to be selfish and

say goodbye and good luck. But this

is more than love. This is a mental

decision. Just wait till tomorrow,

when you see your birthday present.

Then you'll understand.

CAROL

Peggy, I have to talk to you.

PEGGY

What's the matter?

CAROL

It's that jerk Walter.

PEGGY

What happened?

CAROL

After Charlie told Walter that he

broke up with you because he wanted

to play the field, Walter decided

he should do the same thing.

PEGGY

Welcome to the singles' scene.

CAROL

What a I going to do for the rest

of my life? I don't have a

boyfriend anymore.

PEGGY

Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done

you a big favor. You always said

you wanted to get out of town. Go

for it. And be happy, goddamnit,

I'm rooting for you.

WALTER

Hey Charlie, what do you think of

this?

CHARLIE

Walter, maybe you should be a

dentist.

MR. MOSEY (V.0.)

And finally, our heartiest

congratulations to our girls diving

team for placing second in the

county finals last Friday. And a

special accolade to Rosalie Testa

who placed first in every one of

her events. We're proud of you,

Rosalie.

DOLORES

What's the matter, princess? Lost

your prince?

PEGGY

You know Dolores, there's a lot of

things I could say to you, but

you're not worth the effort.

PEGGY

Sorry. These fountain pens are so

tricky.

DOLORES

(screams)

Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate

you. Go gargle with razor blades!

PEGGY

I beg your pardon?

DOLORES

Take a long walk on a short pier.

PEGGY

Have a nice day.

PEGGY

Rosalie! Wait!

ROSALIE

What's up?

PEGGY

I think you should give up diving.

It's dangerous.

ROSALIE

Don't be silly, I'm the best in

the county.

PEGGY

I know you are, but you have to

stop. I couldn't tell you before,

I didn't know if I should. But you

have to stop before you hurt

yourself.

ROSALIE

I spend three hours a day

practicing. I have trainers, I know

what I'm doing.

PEGGY

But accidents can happen.

ROSALIE

Not to me they don't. I'm going to

win the State, then the. Nationals,

and then I'm going to the Olympics.

PEGGY

Rosalie, please, listen to me! You

have to stop.

ROSALIE

You're sick. You should go to the

nurse. I'm going to tell Miss

Dennis.

RICHARD

What's the matter?

PEGGY

It's all, gone wrong, nothing's

working out.

RICHARD

Not true.  I think I'm making real

progress on the microchip.

PEGGY

You were meant to. You're one of

those fortunate people that good

things happen to. I have to get out

of here.

RICHARD

Peggy, I believe you. I believe

everything you told me. It's

wonderful. You're the exception

that proves the rule.

PEGGY

I love you too, Richard. Thanks for

trying.

CHARLIE

Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute.

CHARLIE

I cut shop and did some work on

your song. You know, it's not half

bad for your first try. Of course,

I changed all the "yeahs" to

"oohs". Listen to this.

PEGGY

Forget it, it'll never work.

CHARLIE

Okay. Listen, I cancelled the

tickets for Fabian. I thought it

would be better for your birthday

to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez

Tres.

BUS DRIVER

Everybody gettin' off at Dumont.

Here we are.

PEGGY

Thank you.

MAN

No trouble at all.

BARNEY

Hello, Lilla!

ELIZABETH

Peggy Sue!

BARNEY

Quite a bit more rain than usual

this year. I hope it doesn't spoil

the rhubarb.

ELIZABETH

I've already got some in. I was

thinking of making a pie for dinner

tonight.

(turning around to Peggy)

How would you like that?

PEGGY

(like a little girl)

Fine.

(beat) )

Grandma, would you teach me how to

make strudel?

ELIZABETH

That's a day's work. But if that's

what you want, maybe we can do it

tomorrow for your birthday.

BARNEY

What's the matter, Lilla? Somebody

jump on your grave?

ELIZABETH

You know, Peggy Sue, your mother

said you had a dream that I died.

PEGGY

I wish she hadn't.

ELIZABETH

I'm not afraid. I know exactly when

I'm going to die.

BARNEY

What's it going to be, Elizabeth?

Seventyfive? Eighty?

ELIZABETH

I'm not telling.

BARNEY

I've been trying to drag it out of

her for years.

(beat)

You know, dreams are fascinating

business. 'Specially where you see

the future.

PEGGY

Do you believe in all of that?

BARNEY

Well, I like to speculate. This

book I'm reading right now, a woman

in Colorado says she lived in

Ireland a hundred and fifty years

ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy-

and she gives names and dates and

where she lived. She was

hypnotized. Big bestseller.

PEGGY

I remember that book!

(beat)

Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell

you something.

ELIZABETH

If you believe it, darling, then I

believe. Being young can be just

as confusing as being old. The

things that happened to me fifty

years ago are more on my mind than

what happened yesterday.

PEGGY

But I'm remembering the future.

ELIZABETH

Right now you're just browsing

through time. Choose the things

you'll be proud of. The things that

Last.

PEGGY

My children make me happy. I miss

them so much.

(beat)

Beth. Scott and Beth.

(beat)

I'm going to name my daughter after

you.

BARNEY

It's gonna rain again. Every

time I wash the car, it rains.

PEGGY

That never changes.

(beat)

You know, when you and Grandma are

gone, the family's gone. I never

see the cousins anymore.

BARNEY

It's your grandma's strudel that's

kept this family together.

PEGGY

Grandpa, if you had a chance to do

it all again, what would you do?

BARNEY

(jawing)

I'd take better care of my teeth.

ELIZABETH

What's Peggy Sue going to do at

your lodge meeting?

BARNEY

It's her 18th birthday, I want to

show her off.

PEGGY

It was my idea, Grandma. I always

wondered what went on at those

lodge meetings.

ELIZABETH

He won't tell me, but I've got my

suspicions. And I don't want any of

that. Don't keep her out late.

BARNEY

Let's go.

PEGGY

(hugging Elizabeth)

Goodbye, Grandma.

ELIZABETH

Have a good time.

PEGGY

What does Grandma think you do at

your meetings?

BARNEY

Stag movies. Smokers.

BARNEY

I may be an old fool, but I think

we can help you.

PEGGY

I hope so. At least I got to see

you and Grandma.

(beat)

Has it ever worked before?

BARNEY

The last one was six hundred years

ago. It's about time for another

one.

GEORGE

Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to

have you with us.

PEGGY

Thank you.

HENRY

You know, you're a lucky girl. You

could lay a bear trap in the aisle

of the cathedral and never catch a

better man than your grandfather.

PEGGY

Ah... thank you.

BARNEY

Let me take your jacket, Lilla.

I've got, to get my robe.

AL

You know, this is very exciting for

all of us.

GEORGE

We've been waiting a long time for

someone like you.

PEGGY

(nervous)

Do you have to wear that hat?

BARNEY

It wouldn't be a lodge without

hats.

BARNEY

Don't you worry. I'll be watching

after you.

HENRY

Hey, George. Get the lights.

LEO

(to Peggy)

Are you ready, dear?

PEGGY

Yes, sir.

PEGGY

Fasten your seat belts. Here we go.

LEO

Lord of the Universe, Vast and

Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King

of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air,

fire and water.

(kneeling down)

We adore thee and invoke thee!

Grant thine aid.

Look with favor upon us as we

witness the regeneration of man. We

behold the innocent endeavors of

singleminded men and women. For we

are the company of unbodied souls

and immortal angels. We ask thy

intervention, that this girl may

return to thee on the wings of your

Love.

PEGGY

(sotto)

This is never going to work.

MEN

Fount of life, Chariot of the

Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim

thy child of light.

LEO (O.S.)

The name of your love is sacrifice.

We offer up this girl, that her

soul may find its home.

LEO (0.S.)

Nothing to worry about. Somebody

get the lights.

GEORGE

(chipper)

Well, the girl's gone. Let's play

some poker.

PEGGY

What the hell did you do that for?

What are you doing here?

CHARLIE

I was trying to save you. They were

going to vaporize you.

PEGGY

Don't be ridiculous! They're just a

bunch of harmless old men. My

grandfather was in there.

CHARLIE

You're going to listen to me.

PEGGY

I'm not getting in that blue

monstrosity.

PEGGY

Let me got! Where are you taking

me?

CHARLIE

Right here. Now sit down.

CHARLIE

Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive

you for everything. I know what

you've been going through. You're

just scared. I was scared, too, but

I'm not anymore.

PEGGY

How could you possibly know what

I've been going through?

CHARLIE

Because I love you, damnit! I had a

long talk with your father

yesterday and we decided that the

best thing for us to do is get

married and settle down. Right

away.

PEGGY

What do you mean you and my father

decided? Who the hell are you to

plan my life? Let's get married and

live happily ever after. Bullshit.

I got knocked up. I had to marry

you. I never had a choice.

CHARLIE

What?

PEGGY

You betrayed me, Charlie. You were

never there for me or the children.

And now you come and tell me,

"Peggy, you're scared." Of course

I'm scared. If you knew what I knew

you'd be scared shitless.

CHARLIE

You're crazy! You're really out of

your mind!

PEGGY

I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy

enough to marry you twice. There's

a lot of things I can't change. I

can't even think about them. I

tried. But I couldn't even help

Rosalie.

(tears start)

I don't want to be bitter. I'm a

naturally optimistic person. But

you took advantage of that.

CHARLIE

Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all

my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't

bother you anymore. I promise.

Please stop crying. Please.

PEGGY

Will you take me back to my

grandparents?

CHARLIE

Of course.

CHARLIE

It's almost your birthday. I wasn't

sure when you were coming back, so

I brought your present up here.

PEGGY

(anguished)

Oh, Charlie.

CHARLIE

It opens, too. Look inside.

PEGGY

Scott and Beth. Where did you get

these?

CHARM E

Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother

gave me our picture. That's you and

me.

PEGGY

So are Scott and Beth.

CHARLIE

(tenderly)

I love you.

PEGGY

I know.

DISSOLVE:

CHARLIE

I think we should get out of here.

It's going to rain.

PEGGY

(musing)

Do you think anybody in the Fifties

ever made love on a bed?

CHARLIE

What the hell is that?

CHARLIE

Peggy! Where're you going? Come

back!

PEGGY

I've got to go now.

CHARLIE

But I love you. I'll love you

forever.

PEGGY

I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll

love you for twenty years.

CHARLIE

Come back to me.

PEGGY

I'm trying.

CHARLIE

Richard, do something!

RICHARD

I can't! It's out of control!

CHARLIE

Peggy!

DISSOLVE/OPTICAL

CHARLIE

(singing softly).

Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need

you Peggy Sue...

PEGGY

Charlie? Was I dead?

CHARLIE

I thought you were...for a while.

PEGGY

(affectionately)

You look awful, like you haven't

slept in days. And so old.

CHARLIE

But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.

PEGGY

Charlie, I thought I knew

everything about you.

CHARLIE

I wanted to apologize. I can't live

without you.

PEGGY

What about Janet?

CHARLIE

That's over. I got tired of

translating everything. She thought

the Big Hopper was a hamburger.

PEGGY

Who are all the flowers from?

CHARLIE

Everyone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol

and Walter. Richard Norvick.  And

here's a book, by that guy from

high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.

He dedicated it to you.

to Peggy Sue and a Starry

".

PEGGY

It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew

him.

CHARLIE

I'll just set it right here.

PEGGY

Charlie, I had a strange

experience.  I went back to high

school. And I spent a lot of time

with you.  And you and Walter and

Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".

CHARLIE

Oh, God, Dion.

PEGGY

You were terrific.  And I kept

trying to push you away but you

wouldn't give up.

CHARLIE

I'll never give up.

PEGGY

Then hold me.

CHARLIE

I loved you since the day I met

you, and I haven't stopped.

PEGGY

Don't try to charm me, Charlie

Bodell.

CHARLIE

Listen, I don't expect all the

troubles between us can just vanish

away. But I would do what I can...

PIGGY

Charlie, please, I need some time.

CHARLIE

Well, I'll let you get some

rest...so long.

PEGGY

Charlie, I would like to invite you

to dinner at home, on Sunday, with

your kids. I will make a strudel.

FADE OUT.

THE END

RICHARD

You know, Peggy, there's so many

things to look forward to in the

future.

PEGGY

I came to say goodbye.

RICHARD

Goodbye? Where're you going? What

about our partnership? I'm making

real progress with the microchip.

PEGGY

You were meant to  You're one of

those fortunate people that good

things happen to.

RICHARD

So are you. You've got a vision.

PEGGY

(manic)

Vision? I'm a walking anachronism!

I've upset my parents. I miss my

kids. I could be trapped here

forever! And poor Charlie...I got

pregnant on my 18th birthday and we

had to get married. Tomorrow's my

birthday! I've got to get out of

here now.

RICHARD

Did you break up with Charlie?

PEGGY

Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big

gamble. I've loved him for a long,

long time.

RICHARD

Okay. Why don't we do something

visionary. Change your destiny,

Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and

marry me.

PEGGY

(slamming down book)

No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married!

Case closed. I don't want to marry

anybody. Goodbye Richard.

RICHARD

Wait! I'll go with you!

PEGGY

You can't. You're going to

be Valedictorian.
