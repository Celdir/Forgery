PRETTY WOMAN

FINAL SCRIPT

by Jonathan Frederick Lawton

From the original script written by J.F. Lawton, with the help of

Stephen Metcalfe, Barbara Benedek, Robert Garland and probably

Garry Marshall (the director of the film) himself. This original

script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called Three

Thousand, which was a much darker story about prostitution and

drugs.

SILVER SCREEN PARTNERS IV

MAN (voice over)

Broke in right on the two of them. Caught them.

MAGICIAN (voice over)

No matter what they say, it's all about money.

FADE TO :

MAGICIAN (voice over)

So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan

officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ?

MAGICIAN (voice over)

You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all

four. Just take a look.

WOMAN (voice over)

Oh !

MAGICIAN (voice over)

But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this

one's only worth about a penny.

MAN (voice over)

Hmm.

MAGICIAN (voice over)

And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

PHILIP

A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?

PHILIP

Have you seen Edward ?

THE YOUNG MAN

No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

PHILIP

Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a

caterer.

PHILIP

Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ?

HOWARD

Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse

Industries.

PHILIP

Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.

HOWARD

Can I get in on it ?

PHILIP

Yeah. Call me.

HOWARD

When ?

PHILIP

Just call me.

PHILIP

Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.

THE GUEST

Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ?

PHILIP

Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner

somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

PHILIP

How are you ?

EDWARD

I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she

call you ?

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak

to you.

EDWARD

I see.

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

EDWARD

This is a very important week for me. I need you here.

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at

your beck and call.

EDWARD

I do not believe that you are at my beck and call.

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I

should just move out.

EDWARD

If that's what you want, yes.

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.

EDWARD

Now is as good a time as any.

JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

EDWARD

Good-bye, Jessica.

YOUNG MAN

Phil suggested that maybe I should take a lawy...

EDWARD

Phil is just my lawyer, okay ?

YOUNG MAN

Yes, sir.

EDWARD

How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei ?

YOUNG MAN

I don't know.

EDWARD

You don't know ? Tokyo opened maybe ninety minutes ago. You

have to keep on top of these things, all right ?

YOUNG MAN

Done.

CHARMING WOMAN

Hello, Mr. Lewis.

EDWARD

Hi. How're you doing ?

EDWARD

I want this whole thing... wrapped up as soon as possible.

I gotta get to New York by Sunday. I got tickets to the

Met.

YOUNG MAN

Yes, sir.

SERVANT

Your coat, Mr. Lewis.

EDWARD

Thank you.

SUSAN

Edward !

EDWARD

Susan !

SUSAN

Hi.

EDWARD

Hi.

SUSAN

I was sorry to hear about Carter.

EDWARD

Oh, yeah. Thanks. Heard you got married.

SUSAN

Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you !

EDWARD

Mmm... Mmm... Susan, tell me something.

SUSAN

Yes ?

EDWARD

When you and I were dating, did you speak to my secretary

more than you spoke to me ?

SUSAN

She was one of my bridesmaids.

EDWARD

Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.

EDWARD

Bye.

SUSAN

Thanks, bye.

PHILIP

Do you ?

THE RED-HAIR WOMAN

Absolutely.

PHILIP

Wonderful.

ELIZABETH

He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

PHILIP

Excuse me.

THE RED-HAIR WOMAN

Sure.

EDWARD (voice over)

Is this Mr. Stuckey's car ?

PHILIP

Edward, where you going ?

EDWARD

You got the keys to your car ?

PHILIP

Why, what's wrong with the limo ?

EDWARD

Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it

out.

PHILIP

Mmm.

EDWARD

Please give me the keys.

PHILIP

All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a

little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something

out here.

PHILIP

Fellas, what kind of a system is this ? Can you move these

cars out of here ?

PHILIP

Look, Edward. Edward... Uh, are you familiar with a stick

shift ?

EDWARD

Uh, yeah.

PHILIP

Have you driven a shift ?

EDWARD

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

PHILIP

Listen, all right. Just be ginger with it. Don't...

PHILIP

It's a new car. Don't, uh... Just don't...

EDWARD

Okay. I can do it.

PHILIP

Edward ! Give me a break, please !

EDWARD

I love this car.

PHILIP

I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're

going. You're gonna get lost in the dark !

PHILIP (YELLING)

You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.

EDWARD

Yes, you can handle this.

EDWARD (voice over)

First is here somewhere.

VIVIAN

Hey, sugar, you looking for a date ?

EDWARD

No, I wanna find Beverly Hills. Can you give me

directions ?

VIVIAN

Sure. For five bucks.

EDWARD

Ridiculous.

VIVIAN

Price just went up to ten.

EDWARD

You can't charge me for directions.

VIVIAN

I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.

EDWARD

All right, okay ?

CARLOS

Is that Vivian ?

ANOTHER MAN

Where ?

EDWARD (voice over)

All right. You win, I lose. Got change for a twenty ?

VIVIAN

For twenty, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the

stars live.

EDWARD

Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's.

VIVIAN

Right. Uh, down the street.

CARLOS

Vivian, did you forget ? I told you don't take no dates

tonight.

CARLOS (voice over)

Vivian !

VIVIAN

Let's go.

CARLOS (voice over)

Hey, where you going, baby ?

CARLOS (voice over)

Vivian !

VIVIAN (voice over)

Lights ! Lights would be good here.

EDWARD (voice over)

I guess this is not the greatest time to be a hooker, is

it ?

VIVIAN

Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month

at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than

an amateur, I am probably safer.

EDWARD

I like that. That's very good. Should have that printed on

your business card.

VIVIAN

If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.

EDWARD

No, I'm not making fun of you.

EDWARD

No, I'm not making... I'm not. I wouldn't offend you. I'm

sorry.

EDWARD

What's your name ?

VIVIAN

What do you want it to be ?

VIVIAN

Vivian. My name is Vivian.

EDWARD

Vivian.

VIVIAN (voice over)

So, what hotel you staying at ?

EDWARD (voice over)

The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

VIVIAN (voice over)

Down the block, right at the corner.

VIVIAN

Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails !

EDWARD

I beg your pardon ?

VIVIAN

Well, doesn't it blow your mind ? This is only four

cylinders.

EDWARD

You know about cars. Where did that come from ?

VIVIAN

Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they

were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs,

Corvettes.

EDWARD

Ah.

VIVIAN

They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention.

So how is it you know so little about cars ?

EDWARD

My first car was a limousine.

VIVIAN

Oh.

EDWARD

So where is this...

EDWARD

...heavy metal... home ?

VIVIAN

Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your

transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is

a standard H.

EDWARD

Standard H. Like I know what that means.

EDWARD

Have you ever driven a Lotus ?

VIVIAN

No.

EDWARD

You're gonna start right now.

VIVIAN

You're joking.

EDWARD

No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

VIVIAN

Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of

your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do.

Are you ready ?

EDWARD

I am ready.

VIVIAN

Hang on.

EDWARD

Okay.

VIVIAN

Here we go.

VIVIAN

This has pedals like a race car. They're really close

together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive,

because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size

nine.

VIVIAN

You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to

your wrist ?

VIVIAN

Did you know that ?

EDWARD

No, I didn't know that.

VIVIAN

It's a little bit of trivia.

EDWARD

Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make

these days ? Ballpark.

VIVIAN

Can't take less than a hundred dollars.

EDWARD

A hundred dollars a night ?

VIVIAN

For an hour.

EDWARD

An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a

safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.

VIVIAN

I never joke about money.

EDWARD

Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.

VIVIAN

Well, no. But it's got potential.

HOTEL ATTENDANT

Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car

anymore tonight ?

EDWARD (LAUGHING)

I... I hope not !

VIVIAN

Ah. You're here.

EDWARD

Yeah.

EDWARD

So you'll be all right ?

VIVIAN

Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.

EDWARD

Go back to your office.

VIVIAN

Yeah. My office. Yeah.

EDWARD

Well, thanks for the ride.

VIVIAN

See you.

EDWARD

Good-bye.

EDWARD (voice over)

No taxis ?

VIVIAN

No, I like the bus.

EDWARD

I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an

hour ?

VIVIAN

Yeah.

EDWARD

Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd

be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.

VIVIAN

You got it.

VIVIAN

What is your name ?

EDWARD

Edward.

VIVIAN

Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !

EDWARD

No ?!

VIVIAN

I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.

EDWARD

Why don't you put this on ?

VIVIAN

Why ?

EDWARD

Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that

rents rooms by the hour.

VIVIAN

Ah.

VIVIAN

Wow !

EDWARD (voice over)

It's all right.

VIVIAN (voice over)

Holy shit.

EDWARD

You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting.

FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

EDWARD

Hello. You have messages ?

FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

Yes, we have several.

EDWARD

Thank you.

EDWARD

Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?

FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

Of course.

FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.

VIVIAN

Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in

my pantyhose.

VIVIAN

I'm not wearing pantyhose.

VIVIAN

Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.

EDWARD

First time in an elevator.

THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE

Ah...

THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE

Close your mouth, dear.

VIVIAN

Sorry, I couldn't help it.

EDWARD

Try.

DENNIS

Penthouse.

VIVIAN

The penthouse. Mmmm !

EDWARD

Yes.

EDWARD

To the left.

VIVIAN

Oh.

EDWARD

Oh, I miss keys.

EDWARD

Impressed ?

VIVIAN

You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of

fact, they do rent this room by the hour.

EDWARD

Sure they do.

VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)

Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the

ocean from out here.

EDWARD

I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.

VIVIAN

Why don't you go out there ?

EDWARD

I'm afraid of heights.

VIVIAN

You are ?

VIVIAN

So how come you rented the penthouse ?

EDWARD

It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the

first floor, but I can't find one.

VIVIAN

Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do

with me ?

EDWARD

Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.

VIVIAN

No ?

EDWARD

I hadn't exactly planned this.

VIVIAN

Well, do you plan everything ?

EDWARD

Always.

VIVIAN

Yeah. Me too.

VIVIAN

I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was

a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of fly by the

seat of my pants girl. You know, moment to moment. That's

me. That's... Yeah.

VIVIAN

Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe

break the ice.

EDWARD

Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

VIVIAN

Cash works for me, yeah.

EDWARD

You're on my fax.

VIVIAN

Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

EDWARD

Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

VIVIAN

All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I

got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold

circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and

only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you

say ? Hmm ?

EDWARD

A buffet of safety.

VIVIAN

I'm a safety girl.

VIVIAN

All right, let's get one of these on you.

EDWARD

No, no. I...

EDWARD

Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?

VIVIAN

Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh,

business or pleasure ?

EDWARD

Business, I think.

VIVIAN

Business, you think.

VIVIAN

Well... let me guess.

VIVIAN

That would make you... a lawyer.

EDWARD

A lawyer ?

VIVIAN

Mm-hmm.

EDWARD

What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?

VIVIAN

You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.

EDWARD

I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

VIVIAN

I've known a lot of everybody.

VIVIAN

What is that ?

EDWARD

Champagne.

VIVIAN

Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load

off.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

Good evening.

VIVIAN

Hi.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

Uh, where would you like it ?

VIVIAN

Where would we like it ?

EDWARD

Uh, over by the bar.

VIVIAN

Excuse me !

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

EDWARD

Thank you.

VIVIAN

What are you looking at ?

VIVIAN

What is he looking at ?

EDWARD

Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

VIVIAN

A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.

(in a much softer voice)

Stupid.

EDWARD

Don't worry about it.

VIVIAN

You mind if I take my boots off ?

EDWARD

Not at all.

VIVIAN

So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?

EDWARD

I have both.

VIVIAN

Where are they ? Shopping together ?

EDWARD

My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...

with my ex-dog.

EDWARD

There you go.

EDWARD

My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of

my apartment even as we speak.

EDWARD

Why don't you try a strawberry ?

VIVIAN

Why ?

EDWARD

It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

VIVIAN

Oh, groovy.

VIVIAN

Pretty good. Don't you drink ?

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've

got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing,

okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it

along ?

EDWARD

Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue

with you.

EDWARD

Why don't we just get through that right now ?

VIVIAN

Great, let's get started.

EDWARD

How much for the entire night ?

VIVIAN

Stay here ?

(SHE SNICKERS)

You couldn't afford it.

EDWARD

Try me.

VIVIAN

Three hundred dollars.

EDWARD

Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

VIVIAN

Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I

mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.

EDWARD

To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone

tonight.

VIVIAN

Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.

EDWARD

I bet you have.

VIVIAN

So what do you want me to do ?

EDWARD

I don't know. I really don't know.

VIVIAN

I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to

me.

EDWARD

I didn't hear you. What did you say ?

VIVIAN

Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.

EDWARD

What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What

are you hiding ?

VIVIAN

Nothing.

EDWARD

All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want

any of this. Get your things and your money and please

leave.

VIVIAN

I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs

when I was fourteen.

EDWARD

What is this ? What is this ?

EDWARD

This is dental floss.

VIVIAN

Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you

shouldn't neglect your gums.

EDWARD

I'm sorry. Please continue.

VIVIAN

Thank you.

VIVIAN

Are you gonna watch ?

EDWARD

No, I'm going.

VIVIAN

Thank you.

EDWARD

It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.

VIVIAN

Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out

of me.

VIVIAN

You're watching.

EDWARD

I'm going.

EDWARD (voice over)

Yes, that may be true, Vance.

EDWARD (voice over)

Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse

Industries.

EDWARD

Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from

Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank

you very much.

VIVIAN

I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't

want a drink ?

EDWARD

I'm high on life. Can't you tell ?

VIVIAN (voice over)

You know, I never saw this episode.

VIVIAN

What do you want ?

EDWARD

What do you do ?

VIVIAN

Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.

EDWARD

Neither do I.

THE MAN WITH THE BROOM

Hey, how you doing there ?

THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT

All right.

BARNEY

Good morning, gentlemen.

ONE OF THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT

Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

BARNEY

Good morning, good morning.

ANOTHER ATTENDANT

Good morning, sir.

ONE OF THE FEMALE CLERKS

Good morning.

THE OTHER FEMALE CLERK

Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

BARNEY

Good morning, Marjorie.

EDWARD

Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected.

He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't

think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.

PHILIP

He wants to meet you face to face, hmm...

EDWARD (whispering to the waiter)

Okay.

PHILIP (voice over from the telephone)

I wouldn't do it.

EDWARD

Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set

it up.

PHILIP

Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea

that you see him.

PHILIP

Definitely not alone.

(HE CHUCKLES)

You know ? He's a feisty old guy. You know, we say the

wrong thing...

(He snaps his fingers)

...we could wind up in court.

EDWARD

Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are

gonna go wrong.

EDWARD

That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil,

about your car.

PHILIP

Oh, God. What ?

EDWARD

It corners like it's on rails.

PHILIP

What ? What does that mean ?

PHILIP (voice over on the telephone)

Edward ? Edward !

VIVIAN

Hi.

EDWARD

Well, good morning.

VIVIAN

Red.

EDWARD

Better.

VIVIAN

Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm

gonna be out of here in just a minute.

EDWARD

No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be.

EDWARD

Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?

EDWARD

I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.

EDWARD

I didn't know what you'd like.

VIVIAN

Thanks.

EDWARD

All right ? Good.

EDWARD

Did you sleep well ?

VIVIAN

Yeah, too good.

VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)

I forgot where I was.

EDWARD

Occupational hazard ?

VIVIAN

Yeah. Did you sleep ?

EDWARD

Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.

EDWARD

I was, uh, working last night.

VIVIAN

You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you

hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're

not a lawyer.

EDWARD

That's right.

EDWARD

There are four other chairs here.

VIVIAN

Oh.

VIVIAN

So what do you do ?

EDWARD

I buy companies.

VIVIAN

What kind of companies ?

EDWARD

Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.

VIVIAN

If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain,

huh ?

EDWARD

Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the

bargain price of about one billion.

VIVIAN

A billion dollars ?

EDWARD

Yes.

VIVIAN

Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?

VIVIAN

I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go

in school ?

EDWARD

I went all the way.

VIVIAN

Your folks must be really proud, huh ?

VIVIAN

So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?

EDWARD

No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an

easy thing to do.

VIVIAN

And you don't make anything.

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

And you don't build anything.

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?

EDWARD

I sell them.

VIVIAN

Here, let me do that.

VIVIAN

You sell them ?

EDWARD

Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into

pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than

the whole.

VIVIAN

So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them

for the parts, right ?

EDWARD

Yeah, sort of. But legal.

EDWARD

Mm-hmm.

VIVIAN (voice over)

There. See, now it's perfect.

EDWARD

Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?

VIVIAN

Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.

VIVIAN

I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on

Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I

go ?

EDWARD

Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.

EDWARD (voice over on the phone)

Hello ?

PHILIP

Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

I just wanted to let you know, Morse is all set for

tonight.

EDWARD

Oh, that's good.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

He's bringing his grandson.

PHILIP

He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.

EDWARD

Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.

PHILIP

Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone,

you know.

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

I just want your extra time and your...

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

Look... Well, I just think it'd be better if you... if you

went with a date.

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

Uh-oh !

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

You know ? Keep it social.

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

Uh - uh - uh !

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

Got to know talk, baby, baby !

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

Edward ? Did you hear me ?

EDWARD

Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

If you want to impress me...

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

What is that ?

VIVIAN (SINGING)

Oh-oh-oh...

EDWARD

Housekeeping is singing.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

Got to be too flirty, Mama...

VIVIAN (singing in voice over in the phone)

I know how to undress me...

PHILIP

Yeah... listen.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.

EDWARD

No, you don't.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

I just want your extra time and your...

VIVIAN (SINGING)

Kiss...

EDWARD

Besides, I already have one.

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

If you want to impress me...

EDWARD

You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama.

EDWARD

I'm on my way.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

I know how to undress me Mm-hmm...

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

Yeah, baby...

VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

I want to be your fantasy. Well, maybe you could be mine.

VIVIAN (SINGING)

Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me.

VIVIAN

Don't you just love Prince ?

EDWARD

More than life itself.

VIVIAN

Don't you knock ?

EDWARD

Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.

VIVIAN

What do you want ?

EDWARD

I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend

the week with me.

VIVIAN

Really ?

EDWARD

Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you

consider spending the week with me ?

EDWARD

I will pay you to be at my beck and call.

VIVIAN

Look, I'd love to be your beck and call girl, but, uh,

you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million

girls free.

EDWARD

I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles

this week.

VIVIAN

If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost

you.

EDWARD

Oh, yes, of course !

EDWARD

All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How

much ?

VIVIAN

Six full nights, days too. Four thousand.

EDWARD

Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.

VIVIAN

You want days too.

EDWARD

Two thousand.

VIVIAN

Three thousand.

EDWARD

Done.

VIVIAN

Holy shit !

EDWARD

Vivian ?

EDWARD

Vivian, is that a yes ?

VIVIAN

Yes.

VIVIAN

Yes !

EDWARD

I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some

clothes.

VIVIAN

You really should think about traveler's checks.

EDWARD

We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to

wear.

VIVIAN

Like what ?

EDWARD

Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.

EDWARD

Conservative. You understand ?

VIVIAN

Boring.

EDWARD

Elegant. Any questions ?

VIVIAN

Can I call you Eddie ?

EDWARD

Not if you expect me to answer.

VIVIAN

I would've stayed for two thousands.

EDWARD

I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.

VIVIAN

Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna

let me go.

EDWARD

Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you

go.

VIVIAN

But I'm here now.

VIVIAN

Three thousand dollars !

VIVIAN

Oof !

KIT

Hello ?

VIVIAN

I called and called. Where were you last night ?

KIT

Ma ?

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

It's Viv.

KIT

Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you ?

VIVIAN

Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I

am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His

bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !

KIT

Do I have to hear this ?

VIVIAN

Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what

he's gonna give me ?

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

Guess. You'll never guess.

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

Three thousand dollars.

KIT

Bullshit !

VIVIAN

I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.

KIT

Oh, man ! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you !

KIT

Three thousand. Really ? Is he twisted ?

VIVIAN

No.

KIT (voice over on the phone)

Ugly ?

VIVIAN

He's good-looking !

KIT (voice over on the phone)

Well, what's wrong with him ?

VIVIAN

Nothing.

KIT

Did he give you the money yet ?

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

At the end of the week.

KIT

That's what's wrong with him.

VIVIAN

Well, he gave me three hundred for last night. And, Kit ?

VIVIAN

I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you

to pick it up.

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Write it down. Are you

writing it down ? You'll forget it. Write it down.

KIT

Reg... Bev... Wil.

VIVIAN

Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes ? Good

stuff, on him.

KIT

In Beverly Hills ?

VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

Yeah.

KIT

Rodeo Drive, baby.

BARNEY

Ah !

VIVIAN

Hi.

MISS WILSON

Yes, ma'am. May I help you ?

VIVIAN

Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna

pick it up.

VIVIAN

Don't open that.

MISS WILSON

No, ma'am.

[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]

THE ITALIAN GUEST

Multo Grazie. Arrivederci.

BARNEY

Arrivederci.

THE ITALIAN GUEST

Andiamo.

BARNEY

Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ?

MISS WILSON

No, sir.

SALESWOMAN # 1

May I help you ?

VIVIAN

Well, I'm just checking things out.

SALESWOMAN # 1

Are you looking for something in particular ?

VIVIAN

No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative.

SALESWOMAN # 1

Yes.

VIVIAN

You got nice stuff.

SALESWOMAN # 1

Thank you.

VIVIAN

How much is this ?

SALESWOMAN # 1

I don't think this would fit you.

VIVIAN

Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it

was.

SALESWOMAN # 1

How much is this, Marie ?

SALESWOMAN # 2

It's very expensive.

SALESWOMAN # 1

It's very expensive.

VIVIAN

Look, I got money to spend in here.

SALESWOMAN # 1

I don't think we have anything for you. You're obviously in

the wrong place. Please leave.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Doctor's office ? Two blocks down and to your left.

MAN'S VOICE

Thank you.

ONE OF THE BUSINESSMEN

Tiffany is taking the corner space. They like the project.

We're very excited about the whole thing. Did you realize

that Via Rodeo is the first new street... in Beverly Hills

in seventy-five years ?

BARNEY

Excuse me, miss, may I help you ?

VIVIAN

I'm going to my room.

BARNEY

Uh, do you have a key ?

VIVIAN

Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.

BARNEY

You're a guest here ?

VIVIAN

I'm with a friend.

BARNEY

And who would that be ?

VIVIAN

Edward.

BARNEY

Edward ?

VIVIAN

Edward... Edward, uh...

BARNEY

Mm-hmmm.

VIVIAN

He knows me.

BARNEY

Dennis.

BARNEY

Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?

DENNIS

Yes, sir.

BARNEY

Do you know this young lady ?

DENNIS

She's with Mr. Lewis.

BARNEY

Mr. Lewis ?

VIVIAN

That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.

DENNIS

Evidently she joined him last night.

BARNEY

Thank you.

VIVIAN (voice over from the elevator)

Oh, God ! What now ? What ? What ?

VIVIAN

What is with everybody today ?

BARNEY

No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a

little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.

VIVIAN

I'm coming. I'm coming.

BARNEY (voice over)

Uh, what is your name, miss ?

VIVIAN (voice over)

What do you want it to be ?

BARNEY

Don't play with me, young lady.

VIVIAN

Vivian.

BARNEY

Thank you. Vivian.

BARNEY

Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't

happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis,

however, is a very special customer, and we like to think

of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we

would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm

assuming that you're a...

BARNEY

Relative ?

VIVIAN

Yes.

BARNEY

Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...

VIVIAN

Niece ?

BARNEY

Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see

you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles

here.

BARNEY

Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also

encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately.

that'll be all.

VIVIAN

No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried

to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women

wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no

dress !

VIVIAN

Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this,

okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody

will help me.

VIVIAN

Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops.

That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

BARNEY

Women's clothing.

BARNEY

Bridget, please.

BARNEY

Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the

Regent Beverly Wil...

(HE CHUCKLES)

Well, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for

me, please. I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian.

BARNEY (voice over)

She's a special guest. She's the niece of a very special

guest.

PHILIP (voice over)

Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial

properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los

Angeles.

PHILIP (voice over)

The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the

yard we'll just level.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey.

PHILIP

Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the

projection, please ?

PHILIP

Yeah, what ? Speak.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a 350 million

dollar contract to build destroyers for the Navy.

PHILIP

Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you

said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

I thought they didn't.

MARK

Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more.

Those stocks could go through the roof.

PHILIP

Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir. See, we

can still walk away from it.

PHILIP

Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man-

hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !

MARK

Philip, I think he's right.

PHILIP (raising his voice)

Forget it, Mark.

EDWARD

Gentlemen, relax !

EDWARD

Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations

Committee ?

PHILIP

Senator Adams.

EDWARD

All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.

EDWARD

The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on

anything without going to Appropriations first.

PHILIP

I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

Hello ?

EDWARD

That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.

EDWARD

I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the

geologicals ?

BOB (voice over)

No problem.

EDWARD

Thank you.

PHILIP (voice over)

Edward.

PHILIP

Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?

EDWARD

Mm-hmm.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

Yes, Senator Adams, please.

PHILIP

Who... Who is this girl you're going with ?

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

Yes.

EDWARD

Nobody you know.

THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey. Yes, I have

him right here.

DAY

BRIDGET

Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes

in.

MRS RAINEY

Thank you.

BRIDGET

Have a nice day.

MRS RAINEY

Thank you.

BRIDGET

Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.

VIVIAN

Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.

BRIDGET

He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town ?

VIVIAN

We're gonna have dinner.

BRIDGET

Oh, don't sit on there, dear !

VIVIAN

Oh !

BRIDGET

You're gonna go out ? Dinner ?

VIVIAN

Mm-hmm.

BRIDGET

Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.

BRIDGET

Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your

uncle will love. You're a size six, right ?

VIVIAN

Yeah. How'd you know that ?

BRIDGET

Oh, that's my job.

VIVIAN

Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

BRIDGET

They never are, dear.

VIVIAN

Barney !

VIVIAN

Sorry, mister.

VIVIAN

I got a dress !

BARNEY

Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

VIVIAN

Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got

shoes too. You wanna see ?

BARNEY

No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely.

Thank you.

VIVIAN

Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but

Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say

thanks. You're cool.

BARNEY

You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN

Hello ?

EDWARD

Never, ever pick up the phone.

VIVIAN

Then why are you calling me ?

EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

Did you buy clothes today ?

VIVIAN

I got a dress. A cocktail one.

EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

That's good.

EDWARD

I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp.

VIVIAN (voicer over on the phone)

What ? You're not coming up to the door ?

EDWARD

This isn't a date. It's business.

VIVIAN

Where are you taking me, anyway ?

EDWARD

I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.

EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

Very elegant.

VIVIAN

All right. I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause

you're paying me to.

EDWARD

Well, thank you very much.

EDWARD (to the receptionist)

Get her back for me, please.

THE SECRETARY

Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.

EDWARD

Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone

call.

VIVIAN

Hello ?

EDWARD (smiling on the phone)

I told you not to pick up the phone.

VIVIAN

Then stop calling me.

VIVIAN

Sick.

VIVIAN

Barney !

BARNEY

It didn't fit ?

VIVIAN

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh... I've got a little problem.

BARNEY (voice over)

All right, Miss Vivian, one more time. Dinner napkin.

VIVIAN (voice over)

Dinner napkin...

BARNEY (voice over)

MM-MMM

VIVIAN (voice over)

...laid gently in the lap.

BARNEY (voice over)

Good. Elbows off the table.

BARNEY (voice over)

Don't slouch.

BARNEY

Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork.

VIVIAN

I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the

silverware is a little confusing.

BARNEY

All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four

tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in

the salad fork. And sometimes...

BARNEY

Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of

the hotel.

EDWARD

Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call.

BARNEY

Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir.

EDWARD

From who ?

BARNEY

From your niece, sir.

EDWARD

My what ?

BARNEY

The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.

EDWARD

Oh. Hmm.

EDWARD

I think we both know that she's not my niece.

BARNEY

Of course.

EDWARD

The reason I know that is that I am an only child.

BARNEY

Yes, sir.

EDWARD

What's the message ?

BARNEY

She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady,

Miss Vivian.

EDWARD

Intriguing.

BARNEY

Have a good evening, sir.

EDWARD

Thank you, Mr... ?

BARNEY

Thompson. I'm the manager...

BARNEY

...manager of the hotel, sir.

VIVIAN

You're late.

EDWARD

You're stunning.

VIVIAN

You're forgiven.

EDWARD

Shall we go to dinner ?

MAITRE D'HOTEL

This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.

EDWARD

Stop fidgeting.

EDWARD

Mr. Morse.

JAMES MORSE

Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

JAMES MORSE

This fireball is my grandson, David.

DAVID MORSE

Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is

true enough.

EDWARD

I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine,

Vivian Ward.

VIVIAN

Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.

EDWARD

Mr. Morse. David.

EDWARD

Please, sit.

VIVIAN (SOFTLY)

Excuse me.

EDWARD

Where are you going ?

VIVIAN

I'm going to the ladies' room.

EDWARD

Upstairs, to the right.

VIVIAN

Okay. Excuse me.

EDWARD

Shall I order for you ?

VIVIAN

Yeah.

VIVIAN

Please do so. Thank you.

EDWARD

I'll do that.

DAVID MORSE (voice over)

Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a

company...

DAVID MORSE (voice over)

...should control its destiny.

VIVIAN

Where's the salad ?

EDWARD

Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.

VIVIAN

That's the fork I knew.

DAVID MORSE (voice over)

Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public

statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we

find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions

are.

JAMES MORSE

I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure

which goes with what !

DAVID MORSE (voice over)

You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of

cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.

VIVIAN

Who ordered this ?

THE WAITER (voice over)

The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetit.

EDWARD

These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a

delicacy. Try it. David ?

DAVID MORSE

Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think

you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the

company ?

EDWARD

Break it up and sell off the pieces.

JAMES MORSE

I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...

of your turning forty years of my work into your garage

sale.

EDWARD (voice over)

At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are

going to be a very rich man.

JAMES MORSE

I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.

VIVIAN SMILES

VIVIAN

Slippery little suckers.

THE WAITER (smiling)

It happens all the time.

JAMES MORSE

I met your father. What's his name ?

EDWARD

Carter.

JAMES MORSE (voice over)

Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

JAMES MORSE

He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.

EDWARD

No, I have the franchise on that.

JAMES MORSE

Does that make him proud ?

EDWARD

I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.

JAMES MORSE

Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

VIVIAN

I'm sorry too.

EDWARD

Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for

you ?

JAMES MORSE

Leave my company alone.

EDWARD

I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

JAMES MORSE

I'll buy your stock back.

EDWARD

You don't have the money.

DAVID MORSE

We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.

EDWARD

There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in

Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.

DAVID MORSE

And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got

dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?

JAMES MORSE (voice over)

Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.

JAMES MORSE

Mr. Lewis plays hardball.

EDWARD

Yes, yes, I do.

DAVID MORSE

I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure

to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some

air. Mr. Lewis.

JAMES MORSE

I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.

JAMES MORSE

I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.

JAMES MORSE

Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.

EDWARD

I look forward to it, sir.

EDWARD

Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?

VIVIAN

He seems like a nice man.

EDWARD

I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does

it ?

VIVIAN

I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his

grandson.

EDWARD

Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he

does, but he does.

EDWARD

No, just the two.

THE WAITER (voice over)

Yes, sir.

VIVIAN

It's ketchup.

THE WAITER

Yes, sir.

EDWARD (voice over)

Check, please.

THE WAITER

Yes, sir.

VIVIAN

Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?

EDWARD

Not in this building.

VIVIAN (voice over)

Edward ?

VIVIAN

Edward, you said you never come out here.

EDWARD

Well, I'm only halfway out.

VIVIAN

Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking

about dinner ? I was a maniac.

VIVIAN

I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?

VIVIAN

He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to

let it go.

EDWARD

Thanks for the recap.

VIVIAN

The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.

EDWARD

What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're

making me very nervous. Please come down.

VIVIAN

It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a

little bit like this ?

VIVIAN

Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?

EDWARD

Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking.

VIVIAN

It's really high.

VIVIAN

Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

EDWARD

The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I

like this man or not.

EDWARD

I will not let myself become emotionally involved in

business.

VIVIAN

I know. Kit's always saying to me, Don't get emotional

when you turn tricks. That's why no kissing. It's too

personal.

VIVIAN

It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get

involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do

it.

VIVIAN

I mean... except with you.

EDWARD

Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar

creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.

VIVIAN

I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?

EDWARD

Last month.

VIVIAN

Do you miss him ?

EDWARD

I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I

wasn't there when he died.

VIVIAN

Do you want to talk about this ?

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.

VIVIAN

Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in

front of the TV.

EDWARD

Veg out ?

VIVIAN

Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

EDWARD

Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli

tomorrow.

VIVIAN

Where are you going ?

EDWARD

I'm going downstairs for a while.

REGINA (voice over from the TV)

Did you say marriage license ?

PETER (voice over from the TV)

Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp.

REGINA (voice over from the TV)

Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your

name is.

REGINA (voice over from the TV)

Oh, I love you.

VIVIAN

Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr.

Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?

EDWARD

Thank you. Thank you very much.

VIVIAN

I didn't know you played.

EDWARD

I only play for strangers.

VIVIAN

I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself.

EDWARD

Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?

EDWARD

Thank you.

VIVIAN

People always do what you tell them to do ?

VIVIAN

I guess so.

EDWARD (voice over)

Wake up. Time to shop.

EDWARD

Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them

call the hotel. All right ?

VIVIAN

Oh ! More shopping.

EDWARD

Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress

yesterday.

VIVIAN

Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.

EDWARD

Why not ?

VIVIAN

They were mean to me.

EDWARD

Mean to you ?

VIVIAN

People are looking at me.

EDWARD

They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.

VIVIAN

The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

EDWARD

Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit

cards.

EDWARD

Okay, stop fidgeting.

VIVIAN

All right.

EDWARD

Get rid of your gum.

EDWARD

I don't believe you did that.

EDWARD

Yes ?

HOLLISTER

I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ?

EDWARD

Edward Lewis.

HOLLISTER

Ah, yes, sir.

EDWARD

You see this young lady over here ?

HOLLISTER

Yes.

EDWARD

Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?

HOLLISTER

Oh, yes.

HOLLISTER

Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as

beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I

was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.

That's why when you came in...

EDWARD

Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?

HOLLISTER

...we knew from the first...

EDWARD

We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell

you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of

money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help

sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You

understand that.

HOLLISTER

Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the

right city for that matter.

HOLLISTER

Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to

have some fun. Okay ?

VIVIAN

Okay.

HOLLISTER

Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !

HOLLISTER

Come on. Bring it out, girls.

THE SALESWOMAN

Oh, this is absolutely divine.

HOLLISTER

Excuse me, sir, uh,

EDWARD

Yeah ?

HOLLISTER

Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking

about ? Just profane or really offensive ?

EDWARD

Really offensive.

HOLLISTER

I like him so much !

HOLLISTER

Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty

well, I think.

EDWARD

I think we need some major sucking up.

HOLLISTER

Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful

man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were

someone to reckon with...

EDWARD

Hollister.

HOLLISTER

Yes, sir.

EDWARD

Not me. Her.

HOLLISTER

I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

HOLLISTER

How we doing, ladies ?

PHILIP

Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all

over the street.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

EDWARD

He's countering ?

(LAUGHING)

God, he is a tough old bird.

EDWARD (voice over on the phone)

He knows the navy contracts are stalled. Where's he gonna

get the money ?

PHILIP

I don't know. He, uh... I think he's throwing in with the

employees.

EDWARD

He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.

EDWARD (voice over on the phone)

Find out who it is. I'll be in the office in an hour.

PHILIP

Yeah, okay. You got it.

EDWARD

You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look

great !

EDWARD

She has my card.

HOLLISTER

And we'll help her use it, sir.

LYRICS

Pretty woman walking down the street.

LYRICS

Pretty woman the kind I like to meet. Pretty woman.

LYRICS

I don't believe you. You're not the truth.

LYRICS

No one could look as good as you. Mercy.

VIVIAN

Edward would love that tie.

HOLLISTER

Would you give her the tie ?

THE SALESMAN

The tie ?

HOLLISTER

Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

THE SALESMAN

The tie.

HOLLISTER

He really wants to do this, by the way.

VIVIAN

He would go crazy about this tie.

HOLLISTER

Who ordered pizza ?

LYRICS

Pretty woman, stop a while.

LYRICS

Pretty woman, talk a while. Pretty woman give your smile to

me.

Pretty woman Yeah, yeah, yeah.

VIVIAN

No, thank you.

VIVIAN

Hi.

SALESWOMAN # 1

Hello.

VIVIAN

Do you remember me ?

SALESWOMAN # 1

No, I'm sorry.

VIVIAN

I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

SALESWOMAN # 1

Oh.

VIVIAN

You work on commission, right ?

SALESWOMAN # 1

Uh, yes.

VIVIAN

Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.

Pretty woman don't walk on by.

LYRICS

Pretty woman don't make me cry. Pretty woman.

Don't walk away, hey.

VIVIAN

Wait... Thank you.

Oh, oh, pretty woman.

MAN (voice over)

Mister Lewis.

EDWARD (voice over)

Gentlemen.

PHILIP

Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?

PHILIP

Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two-

thirty, would be good.

PHILIP

You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he

owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from

the bank.

PHILIP

And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?

EDWARD

Hmm.

PHILIP

So, it goes without saying... that your business means a

lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you

gotta do is call the bank.

EDWARD

Yeah.

PHILIP

Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is

wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to

get away ?

EDWARD

You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?

PHILIP

What ?

EDWARD

Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.

PHILIP

So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the

point ?

EDWARD

We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.

PHILIP

We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal.

It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you.

PHILIP

Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's

finish this. Call the bank !

VIVIAN

How was your day, dear ?

EDWARD

Nice tie.

VIVIAN

I got it for you.

EDWARD (voice over)

Well, my mother was a music teacher... and married my

father...

EDWARD (voice over)

...whose family was extremely wealthy.

EDWARD

Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he

took his money with him.

EDWARD (voice over)

And then she died. I was very angry with him.

EDWARD

It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that

sentence : I was very angry with him. I do it very well,

don't I ? I'll say it again. I was very angry with him.

EDWARD

Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.

VIVIAN

I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.

EDWARD

My father was president of the third company I ever took

over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.

VIVIAN

What'd the shrink say ?

EDWARD

He said I was cured.

VIVIAN

Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.

VIVIAN

Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so,

basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy...

VIVIAN

...wrapped around you for the bargain price of...

EDWARD & VIVIAN (together)

...three thousands dollars.

VIVIAN

Yeah.

FADE TO :

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen...

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

...giving you play-by-play of this marvelous charity event.

PHILIP

Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in

something, we're not going back in the car.

PHILIP

Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.

PHILIP

Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?

VIVIAN

What if someone recognizes me ?

EDWARD

Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood

Boulevard.

VIVIAN

You did.

EDWARD

Come on. Let go. Let go.

EDWARD

All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're

gonna have a wonderful time.

EDWARD

Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Humboldt's coming around to this side.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.

EDWARD

This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who

have made marrying well an art form.

GWEN

Edward.

EDWARD

Be back in just a second. Hold on.

GWEN

So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.

GRETCHEN

Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible

bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him.

VIVIAN

Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for

sex.

EDWARD

Well done.

VIVIAN

Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !

VIVIAN

Tell me again why we're here.

EDWARD

Business.

VIVIAN

Business mingling ?

EDWARD

Yeah.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Falcons, seven. Gems, four.

PHILIP

Excuse me. Edward !

PHILIP

Edward. Over here.

EDWARD

Phil.

PHILIP

Ah, good to see you.

EDWARD

Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian

Ward.

PHILIP

Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife,

Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH

It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.

ELIZABETH

Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

ELIZABETH

Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.

PHILIP

Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get

you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with

that. Okay ?

PHILIP

I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?

EDWARD

Mm-hmm. I asked him.

PHILIP

That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !

VIVIAN

Real genuine guy. Who is he ?

EDWARD

He's my lawyer. He's all right.

VIVIAN

You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.

EDWARD

Maybe we'll try that later.

VIVIAN

Are these people your friends ?

EDWARD

I spend time with them, yeah.

VIVIAN

Well, no wonder.

EDWARD

No wonder what ?

VIVIAN

No wonder why you came looking for me.

GWEN

And I do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in

the audience.

GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on

the grass.

GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

So come on out now.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Come on ! Come on, folks.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

You heard her. The stomping of the divots.

BEARDED ANNOUNCER

This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

As old as the game of polo itself.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Kings and queens used to do this.

ELIZABETH

She's sweet, Edward.

ELIZABETH (voice over)

Wherever did you find her ?

EDWARD

976-BABE.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

Only one word of advice : Avoid the steaming divot !

THE MAN

No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your

shoes polished by a member of the club.

THE MAN

I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.

VIVIAN

Thank you.

DAVID MORSE

Vivian, hi. David Morse.

THE WOMAN

Excuse me.

VIVIAN

David.

DAVID MORSE

How are you ?

VIVIAN

I'm okay.

DAVID MORSE

I thought that was you. I like this hat.

VIVIAN

It's new.

DAVID MORSE (voice over)

Yeah ?

VIVIAN (voice over)

Yeah !

ELIZABETH

What are you looking at ?

PHILIP

Edward's date.

ELIZABETH (voice over)

I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car.

Okay, hon ?

PHILIP

Uh-huh.

ELIZABETH

Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked

belly dance for the polo players.

PHILIP

Have fun.

DAVID MORSE

Come meet my horse, Vivian.

VIVIAN

Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to...

DAVID MORSE

Come on. He's right here.

VIVIAN

Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though.

VIVIAN

I didn't know you were playing today.

EDWARD

Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.

PHILIP

Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !

PHILIP

So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?

EDWARD

She's in sales.

PHILIP

Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?

EDWARD

Why do you want to know ?

PHILIP

Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long

time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like

the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't

the difference, especially when I see her talking to David

Morse.

EDWARD (voice over)

I introduced them at dinner the other night.

PHILIP (voice over)

So what ? Now they're best friends ?

PHILIP

I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's

talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's

a little convenient, don't you think ?

EDWARD

Don't be ridiculous.

PHILIP

Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't

attached herself to you because she's bringing information

back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage...

EDWARD

Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me.

PHILIP

What ?

EDWARD

She's not a spy. She is a hooker.

PHILIP

Oh !

EDWARD

She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In

your car.

PHILIP

Oh, you are...

EDWARD

Yes, yes.

PHILIP

Oh, man !

PHILIP

You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of...

who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you

know ?

SENATOR ADAMS (voice over)

Edward !

EDWARD

I'm sorry I told you.

EDWARD

Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.

SENATOR ADAMS

Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.

EDWARD (voice over)

Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it.

EDWARD

There's no change, is there ?

SENATOR ADAMS

No, it's still bogged down.

PHILIP

Having a nice time, Vivian ?

VIVIAN

Yeah, I'm having a great time.

PHILIP

Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ?

VIVIAN

What ?

PHILIP

Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is

safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get

together sometime...

PHILIP

...after Edward leaves.

VIVIAN

Yeah, sure. Why not ?

PHILIP

We'll just have to do that, hmm ?

ELIZABETH (voice over)

Philip !

GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention a couple of our silver

sponsors...

GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

...Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery, and we'd like to

give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor...

GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

Edward Lewis Enterprises.

ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

The ball is in for chukker number four.

EDWARD

You all right ?

VIVIAN

I'm fine.

EDWARD

Fine. That's good. Seven fines since we left the match.

EDWARD

Could I have another word, please ?

VIVIAN

Asshole ! There's a word.

EDWARD

I think I liked fine better.

VIVIAN

You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make

me get all dressed up ?

EDWARD

Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.

VIVIAN

No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a

hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes,

okay ?

EDWARD

I did not... I did not...

VIVIAN

I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy

Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared.

EDWARD

I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for

saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him

for ten years.

EDWARD

He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The

guy's paranoid.

VIVIAN

What are you, my pimp now ?

VIVIAN

You know, you think you can pass me around to your

friends ? I'm not some little toy !

EDWARD

Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.

EDWARD

Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !

EDWARD

I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a

hooker ! And you are my employee !

VIVIAN

Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say

when. I... I say who...

EDWARD

I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I

said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !

VIVIAN

I'm sorry I ever met you.

VIVIAN

I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !

EDWARD

As if you had so many more appealing options.

VIVIAN

I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did

today.

EDWARD

Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.

EDWARD

Where are you going ?

VIVIAN

I want my money. I want to get out of here.

EVENING

VIVIAN

Come on !

EDWARD

I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.

It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you

to go. Will you stay the week ?

VIVIAN

Why ?

EDWARD

I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.

VIVIAN

We were just talking.

EDWARD

I didn't like it.

DENNIS

Down ?

VIVIAN

You hurt me.

EDWARD

Yes.

VIVIAN

Don't do it again.

VIVIAN

First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was

worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum

within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to

him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number

three.

EDWARD

Mm.

VIVIAN

So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum.

EDWARD

So then you chose this as your profession ?

VIVIAN

I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at

wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed

to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and

made it sound so great. So one day I did it.

VIVIAN

I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and,

you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your

childhood dream.

EDWARD

You could be so much more.

VIVIAN

People put you down enough, you start to believe it.

EDWARD

I think you are a very bright, very special woman.

VIVIAN

The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?

PHILIP

No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him

on Monday.

THE RECEPTIONIST

Yes, sir.

PHILIP

Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?

THE SECRETARY

No, he said he had to leave.

PHILIP

He had to...

PHILIP

Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.

EDWARD

Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be

back here in the morning.

EDWARD

Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?

THE RECEPTIONIST

Yes, sir.

EDWARD

Thank you.

PHILIP

Where are you going ?

EDWARD

I have a date.

PHILIP

With the hooker ?

EDWARD

Be careful, Philip.

VIVIAN

Do I look okay ?

EDWARD

Mmm.

VIVIAN

Mmm ?

EDWARD

Something's missing.

VIVIAN

Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell

you that.

EDWARD

Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get

too excited. This is only on loan.

VIVIAN

Oh !

VIVIAN

They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?

EDWARD

I'm a very good customer.

VIVIAN

If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?

EDWARD

Quarter of a million.

VIVIAN

A quarter of a million dollars ?

VIVIAN

So, where are we going ?

EDWARD

It's a surprise.

VIVIAN

If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time

tonight.

EDWARD

Thank you.

EDWARD

When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and

very tall.

LYRICS

You're a dream coming true. I can't believe how I have...

LYRICS

...fallen for you.

LYRICS

You are the one who's led me to the sun.

LYRICS

How could I know...

EDWARD

You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine, do

you ?

LYRICS

...I was lost without you.

VIVIAN

I've never been on a plane before.

LYRICS

And I want to tell you...

LYRICS

...you control my brain.

LYRICS

And you should know that...

LYRICS

...you are life in my veins.

PILOT (voice over)

Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis. The

weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco. We should

be there in about fifty minutes.

VIVIAN

We're late.

EDWARD

No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time.

VIVIAN

Okay.

THE PROGRAM ATTENDANT

Program, sir.

EDWARD

Thank you.

USHER

Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.

EDWARD

Doris.

DORIS

Edward, how are you ?

EDWARD

How nice to see you. Nice to see you.

EDWARD

Sir.

DORIS' HUSBAND

Good evening, Edward.

EDWARD

Wonderful news. Congratulations.

VIVIAN

Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.

EDWARD

It's all right. I've already seen it.

VIVIAN

If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?

EDWARD

Because they're the best.

USHER

Is there anything else, sir ?

EDWARD

No, thank you.

USHER

The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.

VIVIAN

Oh !

VIVIAN

So, you said this is in Italian.

EDWARD

Mm-hmmm.

VIVIAN

So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are

broken.

VIVIAN

Mine are broken.

EDWARD

No, no. That's okay It's all right.

VIVIAN

Oh.

EDWARD

You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

EDWARD

The music's very powerful.

VIVIAN

There's a band !

EDWARD

People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is

very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they

love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may

learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of

their soul.

VIVIAN

Mmm.

VARIOUS SPECTATORS (voices over)

Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo !

DORIS

Did you enjoy the opera, dear ?

VIVIAN

Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

DORIS

What ?

EDWARD

She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.

DORIS

Oh !

EDWARD

Yes. Good-bye now.

EDWARD (voice over)

No, don't touch..

VIVIAN (voice over)

I moved the queen. I like the queen.

EDWARD (voice over)

You can't move the queen.

EDWARD (LAUGHING)

Did you really do that ? Why don't we finish this

tomorrow ? It's really late, and I have to work.

VIVIAN

Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.

EDWARD

Me, not work ?

VIVIAN

Yeah.

EDWARD

I do own the company.

SECRETARY

Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis

called.

PHILIP

What'd he say ?

SECRETARY

He said he's taking the day off.

PHILIP

He's taking the day off ?

SECRETARY

That's what he said.

VIVIAN

I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you

have any money ?

EDWARD

I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have

money.

VIVIAN

Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll

cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

EDWARD

Cop a what ?

VIVIAN

Cop a squat.

EDWARD

All right, read the first two pages.

EDWARD

Okay... Mmm...

EDWARD

I was talking to someone.

EDWARD

Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard

tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's

shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.

EDWARD

What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?

VIVIAN

Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for

a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?

EDWARD

Absolutely.

EDWARD

Darryl !

VIVIAN

Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway,

please ?

EDWARD (voice over)

The Blue Banana ?

VIVIAN (voice over)

The Blue Banana.

EDWARD (voice over)

Very colorful life you lead.

EDWARD

You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice

place.

VIVIAN

I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so

just stay here.

VIVIAN

I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.

EDWARD

I'll block it with my body.

LYRICS

Fame makes a man who'll take things over. Fame Lets him

loose and hard to swallow.

LYRICS

Fame puts you there where things are hollow.

A CUSTOMER

Hey, Viv, you looking good, man. What'd you win, the

lottery or what ?

VIVIAN

Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?

RACHEL

No, not since, uh, Tuesday. Hey, and Carlos is looking for

her too.

A CUSTOMER (voice over)

Hiya, honey, you look great.

VIVIAN

Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?

POPS

I think she went to Santa Barbara.

EDWARD

Hi.

VIVIAN

Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the

week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?

POPS

Okay, honey. Thanks.

VIVIAN

Thanks.

LYRICS

Fame, what you like is in the limo. Fame.

VIVIAN

What's going on out here ?

EDWARD

I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the

middle of West Side Story.

CARLOS

I think you owe me some money, baby.

THE GUY WITH THE STICK

Two hundred dollars.

EDWARD

Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?

CARLOS

Now I hear you got yourself a new job ?

VIVIAN

Let's just leave.

CARLOS

You ain't going no place.

EDWARD

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

CARLOS

You're out of your neighborhood, home boy. This ain't no

Beverly Hills !

EDWARD

I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his

skateboard. He's going to stab me.

EDWARD

What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a

Slinky ?

CARLOS

Shut up !

EDWARD

All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that

this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?

CARLOS

That's right.

EDWARD

Why ?

CARLOS

Because this is my block.

EDWARD

His block ?

VIVIAN

He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go,

Edward.

CARLOS

Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ?

EDWARD

I am not a trick. This is a trick.

EDWARD

Darryl ! Left pocket.

EDWARD

Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank

you, gentlemen.

EDWARD

Don't you ever go near her again.

VIVIAN (voice over)

Does Darryl always carry a gun ?

EDWARD (voice over)

When he drives me, yes, always.

VIVIAN

He sleeps.

VIVIAN

I love you.

VIVIAN (voice over)

What are you thinking about sitting here all by yourself ?

EDWARD

The fact that this will be our last night together, and

you'll finally be rid of me.

VIVIAN

Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

EDWARD

My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New

York.

EDWARD

I'd really like to see you again.

VIVIAN

You would ?

EDWARD

Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an

apartment, to have a car...

EDWARD

...to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up

to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.

VIVIAN

What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you

pass through town ?

EDWARD

Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.

VIVIAN

How would it be ?

EDWARD

Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.

VIVIAN

That's just geography.

EDWARD (voice over)

Vivian, what is it you want ?

EDWARD

What do you see happening between us ?

VIVIAN

I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to

lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty

often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess...

trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.

VIVIAN (voice over)

And then suddenly this knight...

VIVIAN

...on a white horse with these colors flying would come

charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he

would climb up the tower and rescue me.

VIVIAN

But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the

knight say to me, Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a

great condo.

EDWARD

Yes.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

I had to call.

PHILIP

I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

He wants to meet with you today.

EDWARD

What about ?

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

He wouldn't say.

PHILIP

Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We

got him !

PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit

his stocks to us this afternoon. Hmm ?

EDWARD

No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to

wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this

morning. Good-bye.

EDWARD

I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard

everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now.

It's a very big step for me.

VIVIAN

I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.

EDWARD

I've never treated you like a prostitute.

VIVIAN

You just did.

BARNEY

It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.

BARNEY

Could you come down to the front desk ? There's someone

here who wants to speak to you. She says her name is Miss

De Luca...

KIT

Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.

KIT

Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter

police won't let me through. Okay.

KIT

She's on her way.

BARNEY

Fine.

THE ATTENDANT

Mr. Thompson.

BARNEY

Yes.

THE ATTENDANT

The window washer is refusing to come down.

BARNEY

It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.

(to Miss Wilson)

Watch her.

MISS WILSON (voice over)

Yes, sir.

KIT

Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.

VIVIAN

Listen, I've been calling you.

KIT

Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking

for me.

VIVIAN

You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at

the desk.

KIT

I was hiding out from Carlos.

VIVIAN

Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to

hide.

KIT

Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up.

We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested.

It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.

KIT

Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get

off of it.

KIT

You know, he was talking about you last night. He would

bust something if he saw you in this outfit.

KIT

I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !

KIT

You look really good.

KIT

No, something with shade.

KIT

You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the

Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.

VIVIAN

Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.

KIT

Yeah. So, when does he leave ?

VIVIAN

Tomorrow.

KIT

You get to keep the clothes ?

VIVIAN

Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I

think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another

week, right ?

KIT

Definitely no.

VIVIAN

Yeah.

KIT

Oh, no.

VIVIAN

What ?

KIT

I know this weepy look on your face.

VIVIAN

Oh, no, you don't !

KIT

You fell in love with him.

VIVIAN

No. Kit, please. Stop it.

KIT

You've fallen in love with him ?

VIVIAN

Kit !

KIT

Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?

VIVIAN

Uh, yeah, yeah... I did.

KIT

You kissed him on the mouth ?

VIVIAN

I did. It was nice.

KIT

You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth.

Did I not teach you anything ?

VIVIAN

Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with

him. I just... I like him.

KIT

You like him ?

VIVIAN

Yeah.

KIT

You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich,

classy guy.

VIVIAN

Who's gonna break my heart, right ?

KIT

Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you,

right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a

house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I

don't know.

KIT

Anyway, it could work. It happens.

VIVIAN

When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who

does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny

Marie or Rachel ? No !

KIT

Those were very specific cases of crackheads.

VIVIAN

I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one

example of somebody that we know that it happened for.

KIT

Name someone ?

VIVIAN

Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

KIT

You want me to give you a name or something.

VIVIAN

Yeah. I'd like to know.

KIT

Oh, God, the pressure of a name.

KIT

Cinder-fucking-rella.

THE FATHER (voice over)

If you do, I'll give you a piggy-back ride when you... See,

I told you so... Not quick enough for the old man !

THE FATHER

Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy.

THE FATHER (voice over)

Oh, Zachary ! Too many doughnuts.

PHILIP

Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr.

Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening.

JAMES MORSE

I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer...

on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the

people who are working for me.

PHILIP

It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then,

gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts

in front of you. If you look at...

EDWARD

Excuse me, Phil.

EDWARD

Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you.

PHILIP

All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait

outside.

EDWARD

You too, Phil.

PHILIP

What do you mean ?

EDWARD

I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

PHILIP

Why does he get to stay ?

EDWARD

Please, please.

PHILIP

I'll be right outside.

EDWARD

Good.

EDWARD

Is that better ?

JAMES MORSE

It's all right.

EDWARD

Would you like a cup of coffee ?

JAMES MORSE

Black.

EDWARD

Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed.

JAMES MORSE

What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis ?

EDWARD

Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it

apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is

still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in

unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.

JAMES MORSE

Why ?

EDWARD

Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with

your company.

JAMES MORSE

What about our Navy contracts ?

EDWARD

Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little

bit.

JAMES MORSE

You're very good at it.

EDWARD

Thank you very much. It's my job.

EDWARD

I think we can leave the details up to the others.

JAMES MORSE

I find this hard to say without sounding condescending,

but... I'm proud of you.

EDWARD

Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.

EDWARD

Let's continue the meeting.

JAMES MORSE

Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

PHILIP

Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?

EDWARD

It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.

PHILIP (voice over, heard through the door)

Hold it. Hold it. These aren't signed ! These aren't

signed ! Could someone please tell me what the fuck is

going on here ?

JAMES MORSE (voice over, heard through the door)

Mr. Lewis and I are going to build ships together.

JAMES MORSE

Great big ships.

EDWARD

You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here

for a while. I'll be back.

DARRYL

Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

PHILIP

Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.

VIVIAN

Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.

PHILIP

No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.

PHILIP

No, if Edward were with me...

PHILIP

When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow

off billion dollar deals !

PHILIP

I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.

Mind if I have a drink ?

VIVIAN

No.

VIVIAN

No, thank you.

PHILIP

Well, I'll just wait.

VIVIAN

Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.

PHILIP

You know...

(HE CHUCKLES)

...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh,

you are not... the little woman.

PHILIP

You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you

know ?

PHILIP

Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing

millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with

you right now, Vivian.

PHILIP

Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am

really pissed, you know ?

PHILIP

Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you,

huh...

PHILIP

...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy,

just like Edward.

VIVIAN

Hey, get off me !

PHILIP

Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !

PHILIP

Ow !

VIVIAN

Ow !

PHILIP

Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.

VIVIAN (SCREAMING)

Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me !

PHILIP

How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?

VIVIAN (SCREAMING)

Get off me ! Get off me !

PHILIP

Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?

PHILIP

What are you doing ? Get off !

EDWARD

Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !

PHILIP

I don't know how to tell you this. You already did,

Edward !

PHILIP

All right, all right.

EDWARD

Out. Out of here.

PHILIP

Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah !

EDWARD

Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !

PHILIP

I think you broke my nose.

EDWARD

Get out of here.

PHILIP (SCREAMING)

What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten

years ! I devoted my whole life to you !

EDWARD

That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you

love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly

what you loved. Now get out of here !

(YELLING)

Get out !

VIVIAN (voice over)

Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the

cheek ?

VIVIAN

Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do

they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show

you how to do this ?

VIVIAN

Is that... Ow !

EDWARD

Not all guys hit.

VIVIAN

I heard about what you did with Morse.

EDWARD

That was a business decision.

VIVIAN

It was good.

EDWARD

It felt good.

VIVIAN

I think this is okay.

VIVIAN

I gotta get going.

EDWARD

Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?

VIVIAN

Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of

yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that

it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up

everybody ?

EDWARD

That's not why you're leaving.

VIVIAN

Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months

ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and

you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want

more.

EDWARD

I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The

question is how much more.

VIVIAN

I want the fairy tale.

EDWARD

Impossible relationships.

EDWARD

My special gift is impossible relationships.

EDWARD

Thank you.

VIVIAN

You're welcome.

If you ever need anything... dental floss, whatever... you

give me a call.

VIVIAN

I had a good time.

EDWARD

Me too.

EDWARD

Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?

VIVIAN

No, I got it.

EDWARD

I'll carry this.

VIVIAN

Thanks.

EDWARD

Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying

you, but because you want to.

VIVIAN

I can't.

EDWARD

Good-bye.

VIVIAN

I think you have a lot of special gifts.

EDWARD

Mmm.

THE ATTENDANT

I didn't do it, sir.

BARNEY

No, no. Now, I didn't say that. I want you to call

maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate

authority.

THE ATTENDANT

Yes, sir.

VIVIAN

Hi, Barney.

BARNEY

Miss Vivian.

BARNEY

Thank you.

VIVIAN

I wanted to say good-bye.

BARNEY

Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to

New York.

VIVIAN

Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most

of the time.

BARNEY

Have you arranged for transportation ?

VIVIAN

I'm gonna call a cab.

BARNEY

Allow me.

BARNEY

Darryl.

DARRYL (voice over)

Yes, sir.

BARNEY

Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.

DARRYL

Yes, sir.

BARNEY

It's been a pleasure knowing you. Come and visit us again

sometime.

VIVIAN

Stay cool.

From the moment we touched, Till the time had run out.

BELL BOY

Is that everything, sir ?

BELL BOY

I'll meet you downstairs, sir.

EDWARD

Thank you.

KIT

We look so dopey.

KIT

San Francisco's not that great, you know.

KIT

It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.

VIVIAN

I'll wear a sweater.

KIT

What are you gonna do there ?

VIVIAN

Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I

used to make pretty good grades in high school.

KIT

Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.

VIVIAN

Sure you won't come with me ?

KIT

And leave all this ? Not in a million.

VIVIAN

Come here.

KIT

Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?

VIVIAN

It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think

you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.

KIT

You do ? You think I got potential ?

VIVIAN

Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?

KIT

Okay.

VIVIAN

Take care of you.

KIT

No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.

KIT

What time's your bus ?

VIVIAN

An hour.

KIT

Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy.

So, take care of you.

VIVIAN

Whoa.

BARNEY

Mr. Lewis.

EDWARD

You don't have any messages for me, do you ?

BARNEY

No, I'm afraid not, sir.

EDWARD

I'll need a car to the airport also.

BARNEY

Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.

BARNEY

Darryl, the limousine out front, please ?

DARRYL

Yes, sir.

BARNEY

Thank you, Darryl.

EDWARD

One last thing.

BARNEY

Yes.

EDWARD

If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please.

BARNEY

Yes, of course. May I, sir ?

EDWARD

Of course, please.

BARNEY

It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.

BARNEY

You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.

BARNEY

I'll take care of it.

EDWARD

Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

DARRYL (voice over, from the driver's seat)

Your plane is leaving as scheduled, sir, and you should be

back in New York on time.

KIT

I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than

Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking

into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?

KIT

'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You

gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal ?

ANGEL (voice over)

Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.

THE FLORIST

Help you, love ?

EDWARD

There you go. Thank you very much.

KIT

So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in ?

ANGEL

No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was moving

out.

EDWARD

Vivian !

EDWARD

Vivian !

EDWARD (voice over)

Princess Vivian ! Come down !

EDWARD

Had to be the top floor, right ?

VIVIAN (voice over, from the top of the building)

It's the best.

EDWARD

All right. I'm coming up.

EDWARD

So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued

her ?

VIVIAN

She rescues him right back.

THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream ?

THE AFRO-AMERICAN

Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of

Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreaming.

THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on

dreaming.

LYRICS

Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The

kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you.

You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you.

Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I

couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely

as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.

LYRICS

You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed

for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it

didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I

was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in

your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation.

I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would

take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've

been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you

say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I

gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would

take it.
