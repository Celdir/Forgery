BAD BOYS

FADE IN:

1   EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   1

The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of

heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates

ACROSS the SCREEN.

2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2

The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-

ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He

looks to the rear.

FOUCHET

What's taking so long back there?

CUT TO:

REAR

Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,

and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except

for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.

His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-

along grin on his face.

ANDY

How do I look? Like the real

thing, yeah?

FOUCHET

Step back and lemme get a good

look at you.

CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR

THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps

further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the

front.

FOUCHET

Tell me again about your

assignment, Andrew?

ANDY

I'm the decoy.

FOUCHET

Right you are.

Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

DESK MANAGER

I'm sorry.   But our guest list is

LOWREY

Oh, didn't they say? There's

going to be party! It's

B.Y.O.B.O. --

(leans in close)

The B.O. stands for baby oil.

BURNETT

Maybe you can come. Get off after

you get off?

DESK MANAGER

Well, now that you mention it.

They were kinda cute. Suite 202.

Oh man...

THERESA

Marcus, what are you doing?

BURNETT

We're always saying we should

spend more quality time together.

Well, I got the time... and you

got the quality...

BURNETT

I can remember when we used to

do it every morning.

THERESA

That was how we got a three

bedroom house filled with little

Burnetts.

BURNETT

Been over a week since I've had

some quality time!

37   INT. BURNETT'S KITCHEN - MORNING                          37

JILL

Mom, Quincy pushed me.

QUINCY

Uncle Mike showed me that move.

THERESA

Quincy, never-you-mind. And take

those things off in the house!

Jill, stop with the book and eat

your breakfast.

(then, exasperated)

Marcus, why do I always have to

discipline the kids? You play

bad cop for a second.

BURNETT

Kids, knock it off... or your

momma's gonna whoop your butts!

LOWREY

Ah, family life. Reminds me

why I stay single.

JILL & QUINCY

Uncle Mike!   Uncle Mike!

LOWREY

Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.

THERESA

Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't

know where those lips were last

night.

(CONTINUED)

37   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            37

QUINCY

Tell us some stories, Uncle Mike.

You know, the one about the

stewardess?

THERESA

Don't go tellin' my son about

your sleazy sex life?

LOWREY

I promise, Theresa. I only tell

your husband about my sleazy

sex life.

THERESA

I don't want him knowing about it

either! Gives him ideas.

(answers the phone)

Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of

them do you want?

LOWREY

You're live with Lowrey.

(listens for a

long beat)

'Scuse me, Captain. I think you

mean to say, 'Get the fuck down

here, please?'

THERESA

Not so fast. You were going to

take the kids to school today,

remember, hon? I have a job

interview...

DICK

Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got

busted into again last night? When

are you gonna do something about this?

BURNETT

Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta

tell you? I don't work robbery.

I'm in Narcotics.

Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids

pile into the jump seat in the back.

LOWREY

Don't get your sticky fingers all

over my windows... and keep your

feet off the seats, I just had the

leather conditioned.

The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm

around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa

runs out.

THERESA

Marcus... I need you to stop at

Save-More on the way home and pick

up exactly what's on the list.

She hands Burnett a long list.

BURNETT

Oh, baby.   Damn.

Lowrey shakes his head.

Lowrey and Burnett walking.

BURNETT

Twins?

LOWREY

If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her

sister came down and posted the

girl's bail. And later? Man,

talk about special effects.

BURNETT

What special effects?

SANCHEZ

Let's see. There's Sleepy, Grumpy,

Sneezy, Happy, Bashful... Now,

who could we be missin'?

RUIZ

Could it be... Dopey?

LOWREY

If it ain't the leftovers from

Miami Vice. Fashion casualties,

lost somewhere in the eighties.

BURNETT

And the women really go for that.

Really, they do.

41   INT. HEROIN LOCKER - DAY                                   41

HOWARD

Nice of you to roll in. And

nothing particular is going on

around here except, maybe, your

dope is gone. That's right. The

biggest dope bust in the history

of this department up and walked

out of this locker, along with

maybe my job and the two of yours

if we don't get the shit back.

BURNETT

This can't be happening.

(CONTINUED)

41   CONTINUED:                                                 41

HOWARD

So here's what we're gonna do.

Since it was originally your

case, you two guys are on point.

Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them

up with whatever they need.

LOWREY

So I guess we should start with

the C.I.s and the perps from the

original case. But hell if I

know any dope dealers with the

balls to pull this off. They're

either dead or in the lock-up

pending trial.

BURNETT

How's O'Fee?

SINCLAIR (O.S.)

Oh, he'll be just fine.

HOWARD

Name's Sinclair. Internal

Affairs. He's our new proctologist.

SINCLAIR

You see, what's got me confused

is, why risk leaving a witness?

Why not kill O'Fee instead?

BURNETT

Because maybe this guy knows if

you kill a cop the whole

department'll get up his ass

hard and fast.

SINCLAIR

And who knows that better than

anybody else? Cops.

BURNETT

You're not sayin' this was an

inside job. Cops wouldn't pull

this shit.

(CONTINUED)

41   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           41

SINCLAIR

Not just cops. Narcotic cops.

For example, the S.N.D. You've

got access. You've got

wherewithall. And most

importantly, you've got the

connections. Who else would know

how to unload a hundred million

dollars worth of heroin?

LOWREY

Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off-

the-rack suit.

HOWARD

Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's

nothing we can do about it. If

any of this leaks, the shit's

gonna hit our biggest fan.

Remember him? The mayor? He

created us and you can bet your

jobs, boys, he'll rip us into

little cop pieces. I figure we

got seventy-two hours to find the

dope and keep our jobs.

LOWREY

Nothing like a little old-fashioned

incentive.

BURNETT

What about the air conditioning?

HOWARD

So what about it?

BURNETT

(to Lowrey)

What do you think?

LOWREY

I think you should go ahead,

crawl up and give it a good

look.

BURNETT

Why me?

(CONTINUED)

41   CONTINUED:   (3)                              41

LOWREY

For one, it was your idea. Two,

while my suit's fresh, you're

dressed for the occasion.

BURNETT

Don't say nothin' about my

clothes. I paid for these.

LOWREY

And I don't?

BURNETT

Not on a cop's salary.

BURNETT

There's gonna be a lotta cash

when the dope hits the street.

We want you to put the word out

through your bank and hustle the

account.  You help us, maybe we

can see about getting those R.T.C.

auditors off your ass.

LOWREY

Listen, Cedras. You and I both

know you're the number one importer

for the Simona Brothers. And I'm

tellin' you there's a buttload of

H on the move and someone's gonna

wanna stick their dick in it. So

it better not be yours. You hear

something? You call us. You hear

nada? You better get the fuck

outta town.

Lowrey's driving, no seatbelt, doing his usual speed-

weaving. Burnett's hanging onto the handle above the

door.

BURNETT

Not a fucking lead. So now that

we've done the obvious, we need

a shortcut.

LOWREY

Okay.   So we talk to Max.

BURNETT

Huh uh. Not this time. I'm

tired of you working pussy into

everything we do.

LOWREY

You got a better idea?

Once-colorful stucco, fading and crumbling. Scrappy

Cuban fighters spar and work out on the aging equipment

while, at the same time, a remarkable amount of amazing-

looking women work out on weight bags, shadow box with

trainers. Curves and sweat, any way you look.

BURNETT AND LOWREY

enter. And while Lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh

as if it were a day in the park, Burnett lags. Maybe he

has been married too long.

CLOSE ON MAX LOGAN

she's doing sit-ups on an incline bench.     She notices

Lowrey.

MAX

Don't be lookin' at me like I'm

getting all sentimental.

LOWREY

Hey, I didn't open my mouth.

Listen, there's some major, major

ill shit happening down at the

P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's

gonna be a lotta cash involved, too.

Gonna be some happy motherfuckers

around that wanna party.

So you want me to check around?

BURNETT

A cop.

BLACK WOMAN

Oooh.    I love cops.

BURNETT

You know? I'm a cop. I shot

somebody just last week. Didn't

kill him, just shot him in the

ass.

LOWREY

You know, that was really smooth.

Think you could do that again?

(as they start

walking)

Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife

gets meaner, the grass gets greener.

BURNETT

Green ain't the color I was

thinkin' of. More of a coco puff.

Just real shiny, thick...

she wants me to pick up Huggies

that married.

LOWREY

(complies)

Miami's the perfect town for you,

her turn signal on.

BURNETT

And I plan on living to be old

just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay

on my joints and everythin'.

LOWREY

You gonna let every old

motherfucker pass you? Or just

the ones with big-ass trailers

draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.

BURNETT

I don't have a death wish like

you. I  got a family that counts

on me.  A mortgage to pay. And

I'm not sayin' it's me, but most

of the guys in the station think

you're some rich kid playin' cop.

LOWREY

Who said that?

LOWREY

If somebody's talking about me, I

wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of

this. I don't apologize for

nothing I do. I get up early and

take it to the max every day. I'm

always the first guy through the

door. And the last guy to leave a

crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I

could give a shit what those boot

lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin'

motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.

you on the air conditioning

she added something to your grocer

BURNETT

Where are the drugs?

(no answer)

Where... are... the... drugs?

Watch what you touch.   That's

evidence.

BURNETT

Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona.

You've got the right to remain

silent. Anything you say'll

surprise the shit out of us.

BURNETT

Anything?

LOWREY

(finds small notepad)

Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta

bookies. Phone numbers.

BURNETT

Lemme guess. Guy does the air

conditioning contract for the P.D.

He'd have the plans.

LOWREY

He trades the plans for his paper

and gets popped by the perps.

BURNETT

Works for me. Now can we go?

I'm gonna puke.

Please?

LOIS

Okay, then. I'll make the calls.

one of those big, model's shoulder bags to the floor and

JULIE

Okay.   So what'd I miss?

(playful, sarcastic)

So, a party in a Biltmore Hotel

MAX

It's a favor for a friend. If it

sucks after a half-hour, we'll

split and head to South Beach.

JULIE

A favor?

MAX

You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.

JULIE

(rolls her eyes)

Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you

just have sex with the man and get

it over with.

MAX

He's just a friend.

JULIE

Yeah, right.     You're in love.

MAX

It's never gonna happen. I'm

great at turning lovers into

friends. But turning friends

into lovers, I can't do.

JULIE

Well, I don't date cops. They

never have enough money and

they're always too tired to

screw.

MAX

Well, I've told you before, my

Mike isn't like that. If I were

in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is

the only person I'd call.

Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little

guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a

folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.

CHET

Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is

out...

BURNETT

He told me I could use the place

tonight...

CHET

Didn't mention it to me.

Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet

sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on

lipstick.

CHET

Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett?

Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives

him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.

CHET

Your children good? Mr. Lowrey

says you got a regular baby

factory goin' over there.

101   CONTINUED:                                                   101

BURNETT

(all his money)

Here. And if that's not enough,

I'm gonna run you in for extortion.

CHET

Now that I think about it, Mr.

Lowrey did mention something

about giving you the key.

102   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                  102

The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark

for the light switch. Finally finds it.

BURNETT

I forgot I had those switches moved.

Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.

Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but

impressed by the stylish digs.

JULIE

Nice... very nice. All this on a

cop's salary?

BURNETT

I uh... I invest.

JULIE

Right. What was your last pick?

A horse in the number two race at

Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you

an inside tip.

CLOSE ON WINE RACK

Which Julie runs her hands across labels.   All French.

BURNETT

-- My father invests... Listen.

You must be tired --

JULIE

I'll ask you this only   once, Mike.

Are you on the take?    And if you

say no and I discover   you're lying

to me, I'll walk. Are    we clear?

(CONTINUED)

44.

102   CONTINUED:                                               102

BURNETT

Fair enough. I'm not on the take.

Satisfied? Good. So... why don't

you make yourself at home? Here's

the T.V. remote. Watch yourself

some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or

somethin'.

Hits "ON" button. Instead of TV, the room immediately

becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music.

BURNETT

Heh -- all these damn things look

alike.

(switches it off)

Well, gotta run... There's probably

a couple of good steaks in the

fridge for the dogs. Help yourself

to whatever.

(starts to go)

I'll check on you in the morning.

JULIE

Where are you going?

BURNETT

Uh, back to the P.D. I got

paperwork back on my desk to go

through that's about this high.

(to his armpits)

And now there's you, so that makes

it this high.

To his neck.

JULIE

You mean, you're going to leave me

alone? In your place. With all

your stuff?

BURNETT

Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief

or a vandal?

JULIE

Of course not. And I'm not a call

girl, either.

BURNETT

I didn't ask.

JULIE

I know you didn't. I just thought

you should know.

(CONTINUED)

45.

102   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             102

BURNETT

Okay. Important lesson. Julie's

not a call girl. Can I go now?

JULIE

Just one more thing.

Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett.

It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't

reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.

JULIE

Thank you.   For everything.

BURNETT

Don't mention it.

Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE

RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what

to do.

JULIE

Aren't you going to --

LOWREY'S MACHINE (V.O.)

Hi. You're live with Lowrey.

Leave it at the beep.

The PHONE BEEPS.

YVETTE (V.O.)

Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I

told you I don't date cops. And I

know I told you I wouldn't sleep

with a man I wasn't going to marry.

But I've been thinking -- and I

remember when you said thinking was

a dangerous thing -- so I started

feeling... well, lonely. Remember

when you gave me that key --

Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE.

BURNETT

It's uh... It's uh...

JULIE

You don't have to explain.

Finally, they've reached consensus.     Burnett grins and

is out the door.

BURNETT

Lock the door. Don't open it for

anybody.

As Burnett is racing back through to the car, he sees

Chet behind the desk and stops.

BURNETT

Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a

witness. I'm gonna be gone for

about an hour. Do me a favor.

Keep your eye out, okay?

CHET

You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting

off in just a few minutes, so... I

could watch the door if you like.

You know. In a chair. I could

just sit in it. Outside the door

like cops do when they're guarding

shit.

BURNETT

Just keep an eye out.

Heads for the door.

CHET

Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you

know? Just didn't work out. You

know? Politics.

104   INT. BURNETT HALLWAY                                          104

As Doris storms toward her bedroom, Burnett trails her,

apologetically --

DORIS

Don't you 'Honey Baby' me --

BURNETT

-- I swear, baby, it's nothing.

I was on the job --

As she gets to the bedroom, Doris wheels around --

DORIS

And you just happened to lose

your wedding ring -- 'on the

job?!'

He looks down at his ringless finger --

BURNETT

No!   No!    I got it right here...

Doris slams the door in his face, LOCKS it.

OFF Burnett's pained expression --

BURNETT

If you were a real partner, instead

of some no-backup, hot doggin',

car chasin', skirt sniffin'

motherfucker, I would be gettin'

down to business with my wife

instead of stuck in this situation.

LOWREY

Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card.

106   INT. POLICE BASKETBALL GYM                                 106

Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as

his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop,

Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball

and send it back to him.

BURNETT

Chief. I tried to set   the girl

up with a sketch artist  but she

won't. I tried to get   her to come

in and look at the mug  books and

she won't come in.

HOWARD

She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey.

He tosses a brick.

BURNETT

That's right. So let her deal

with the real Mike Lowrey! Who,

I might add, shoulda been there to

take the call instead of runnin'

off like a hot dog without any

backup.

Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all

Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.

LOWREY

Hey. I'm not the one who left a

strange hooker alone in my

apartment. You know, she's

probably on the street sellin'

all my shit as we speak.

BURNETT

I had to stash her somewhere!

She's scared shitless... just

like her dogs.

(CONTINUED)

106   CONTINUED:                                                 106

LOWREY

Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs,

man. I'm going home... explain

the whole thing, take her to the

Motel Six, she'll understand...

HOWARD

Not a good idea.

(brick)

Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's

Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla

hours. Could take all day. You

got a computer with a modem?

BURNETT

Big computer.    Expensive --

LOWREY

Yeah, I got a computer and you

shouldn't touch it. It took me

weeks to get it set up the way I

want it and I don't want amateurs

messing with it.

HOWARD

(brick number four)

Burnett. I'll have Francine give

you the user code for the computer

files and you can run pictures for

the girl on Lowrey's super duper

computer.

BURNETT

So what about me? I can't    tell my

wife I'm shacked up with a   female

witness! Besides, I think    they

made my car last night... I   gotta

stay close to home, just in   case.

HOWARD

Easy. Lowrey moves into your

house. And you're on special

assignment.

Another brick.

LOWREY

No way!   I'm not living in that

zoo.

BURNETT

My house ain't no zoo!

HOWARD

Enough! You're him, he's you!

Until she makes the shooters and

we get the dope back, I don't

care what you have to do, just

make it work!

Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon

retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett,

who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim.

And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard

simply staring.

107   INT. BURNETT BEDROOM - DAY                                   107

Burnett's tossing some things into an overnight bag.

Theresa watches him, concerned.

THERESA

You never had to go to Cleveland

on police business before.

BURNETT

Cleveland's where they collared the

dealer. And that's where I gotta

go to testify.

THERESA

But what about us? The

neighborhood's had all break-ins.

I won't feel safe if you're --

BURNETT

Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't

have the most trustworthy man I

know to look after my family...

THERESA

Oh, no,   Not Lowrey. Not in my

house.

BURNETT

Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my

life and, I most certainly trust

him with yours.

THERESA

Why don't they send him to Cleveland?

BURNETT

Baby. It's a Federal subpoena.

I'm the witness. I'm the one who

has to testify. Case closed. I'm

the one going to Cleveland.

Lowrey's staying here.

Theresa stands at the door with arms crossed. Meanwhile,

Burnett throws his bag in the trunk of the Porsche. He

and Lowrey trade car keys, the Porsche for the Volvo.

BURNETT

Don't forget to put Snail Guard on

my lawn.

LOWREY

Just leave Cleveland the way you

found it.

Burnett climbs in, waves out the window.

BURNETT

Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids.

Lowrey joins Theresa on the porch.    Mockingly he puts his

arm around her and waves.

THERESA

Why's he taking your car?

LOWREY

(seething)

He's dropping it off at the

mechanic on the way to the

airport. The engine  needs an

overhaul... or will by the time

he gets there.

The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of

GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when

Theresa gets in his way.

THERESA

Where you think you're going? I

got a list here of things that

Marcus was supposed --

LOWREY

-- that Marcus was supposed to do.

That's right. Marcus. Not Mike.

'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with

no time to waste.

Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.

into a drug-processing lab. Huge, bakery-sized mixing

BOWLS CHUG on one side of the room while lab workers form

the doughy, cut heroin into pizza-sized forms, and shovel

them into tractor ovens on the other side of the room.

When the pies come out, more lab assistants re-form the

pies into keys.

ON FOUCHET

He's dealing with his 26-year-old chemist named ELLIOT.

FOUCHET

Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot.

Why are we behind?

ELLIOT

The cutting agent is highly

volatile. You can't cook it like

you would a pizza. I had to gear

the ovens down to half-speed.

FOUCHET

We already accounted for that,

Elliot. It's in our fucking

timetable. So what else?

Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his

stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead.

ELLIOT

There's too much moisture down

here. The pies are taking longer

to cook than we originally

planned.

WALLY

Yeah.   It's totally fucked.

BURNETT (O.S.)

Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the

facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny

surface.   Shit.

BURNETT

Crazy fuckin' woman.

He steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door.

JULIE

The guy who killed Max. Now, he

was looking for the heroin that

Eddie stole from him... Max went

to the party as a favor to you.

You're a dope cop, right?

BURNETT

Special Narcotics Division.

JULIE

So this isn't about Max's death

Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her

shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe

string. This ensemble never looked so    good.

BURNETT

Mug shots. We got mug shots to

look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook

into the P.D. computer.

He heads out of the bedroom.

JULIE

Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all

the pictures?

Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of

photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of

Lowrey. All ego.

BURNETT

That guy? Well, that's Marcus

Burnett, my partner.

Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds

the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty

frame, too.

BURNETT

There's the two of us, see?     Me'n'...

(gestures to photos)

... My partner.

it looks that way... But you see...

you see... It's uh... a cop thing.

That's because I've put a picture

up there for every time Marcus has

saved my life.

JULIE

Saved your life?

BURNETT

I save his life. He saves mine. He's

got the same thing in his house.

Pictures of me. More, even. Good

family man, that Marcus.

JULIE

Okay, but Mike. This is like a

lot of pictures. I mean, this

isn't something by the bedstand.

This is a whole wall... And I know

Max said you were just friends.

That's why I was thinking,

maybe... you could be... gay.

Burnett reacts, then recovers with...

BURNETT

Me? Gay?   Are you outta your

mind?

JULIE

I didn't mean to offend you.

BURNETT

It's a good thing that I'm secure

in my manhood to see that you don't

mean that. You know how many women

he makes the deal. What else

did he say?

because he had three little angels

on his shoulders tellin' him

something. I didn't get the rest.

shots)

I'm getting tired of looking at

ugly people.

BURNETT

Just a few more and we can take

JULIE

I don't wanna take a break. Then

we'd have to talk and I got

nothing to say to a cannibal.

BURNETT

A what?

JULIE

That was a living, breathing

consciousness. It felt joy.

Sadness. Maybe it even had a

name.

BURNETT

What had a name.

JULIE

That flesh you're shoveling

into your mouth.

BURNETT

It's just bologna.

Uncle Mike!

LOWREY

Okay... Hang on, Cappy.

(starts reading

from the book)

This is Prudence and she has to

go potty. This is a potty.

Everyone has to poop and when they

do they use the potty.

(turns page)

Mommies poop.

(turns page)

Daddies poop.

Captain Howard poops. Even

doggies poop.

122   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                  122

Burnett is cleaning up dog shit    from one of Lowrey's

Persian rugs. The stain won't     come out. So Burnett

tries a can that he's grabbed.     It foams. Julie appears

with a pile of clean laundry in    hand.

BURNETT

Your dog took a shit.

JULIE

And you used Pledge to clean it

up?

BURNETT

(looks at can)

Lemon Pledge.

JULIE

Well, that makes a big difference.

You just varnished that into the

fabric. I'm sure it works great.

Burnett doesn't quite know what    to do with the wad of

dog poop in paper towels still    in his hand. Julie

snatches it from him and heads    for the bathroom. Burnett

follows. He suddenly realizes     that the clean clothes are

his.

You cleaned my clothes?

JULIE

I just threw them in with mine.

BURNETT

You cleaned my clothes?

He's all appreciative until he notices something dis-

turbing. A shirt of his has a large bleached area on it.

BURNETT

What's this??

JULIE

(shyly)

I had a little accident.

BURNETT

This is my favorite shirt.   My

lucky shirt.

JULIE

Sorry.

As Burnett starts to walk away...

JULIE

Listen, Mike. I don't have any of

my clothes. I wanna go back to my

place to get some.

BURNETT

Not going to happen.

JULIE

I need apparel. That and I need

some food that's something more

than a cold, slab of fear.

BURNETT

Slab of fear?

JULIE

All you got in the place are

frozen steaks.

BURNETT

Alright. I left my wallet at the

office so I'll give you some cash

tomorrow.

Quincy and Jill are rapt as Lowrey does a quick security

sweep, checking closets and window locks as he tells a

bedtime story.

LOWREY (O.S.)

... so your daddy and I are

trapped in this crack house in

Little Havana. These dudes were

real mean mothers... and they

start coming at us with knives...

Now I'm scared, thinkin' I'm out

for the count when in comes your

daddy like a Miami hurricane --

THERESA

Standing in the doorway.   Hands on her hips.

LOWREY

Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin' the

kids about --

THERESA

Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids

in. Say good night to Uncle Mike.

QUINCY

But we want to hear the rest of

the story...

Theresa silences Quincy with a look.   Sensing his cue,

Lowrey kisses the kids.

LOWREY

G'night, gang.

QUINCY AND JILL

G'night, Uncle Mike.

Lowrey is seated on the couch, loading clips and dressing

his weapon on the coffee table. As he pours a Coke,

Theresa appears at the bottom of the stairwell.

THERESA

If you were my husband, I'd

poison that.

LOWREY

If you were my wife I'd drink it.

THERESA

Twelve years I'm married, Michael.

And I never let Marcus bring his

work home.

LOWREY

Just a harmless bedtime story.

Thought the kids deserved to

know about the hero they have

for a dad.

THERESA

We don't need any violence in

this household and we certainly

don't need any more heroes.

What we need is a father and

a husband.

LOWREY

Husband? Theresa. He's your

personal errand boy. You beep

the poor S.O.B. every hour on

the Goddamn hour? And why is

it always about some useless

bullshit that can wait until

later. I mean, the guy's gotta

job to do.

THERESA

You wanna know why I page him?

Because until that phone rings,

I don't know whether he's dead

or alive. And lemme tell you.

Those three minutes I'm waiting

for him to call back? Those are

the hardest three minutes for a

cop's wife.

LOWREY

Touche, Theresa.

Lowrey unhappily pulls into the parking lot driving

Burnett's dilapidated Volvo. Ruiz and Sanchez, walking

from the cars, spot him and laugh as he climbs out of

the wreck.

SANCHEZ

Ooh, mean machine, Lowrey...

LOWREY

Oh, please. Big fucking deal.

You know what I had to do? I

drove your kids to school this

morning. Your son forgot his

homework. So I had to drive him

all the way back in that junker of

yours --

(as if looking at

Burnett for the

first time)

What's that you're wearin'? Is

that my new silk shirt? Is that

my shirt?

BURNETT

Yeah. I know, it's a little big

on me. But cool. I figure, what

about it? If I'm gonna be Mike,

might as well dress like Mike!

(singing)

I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike.

Swish.

Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.    He checks out the number.

LOWREY

Ugh.   I gotta call the wife.

BURNETT

The wife?

Lowrey finds the nearest phone and dials.      Burnett is

thinking Theresa?

LOWREY

Yeah, what's up, baby. Uh-huh.

Yeah. Okay. What else? You want

me do what?

Lowrey glances over at Burnett who's clearly loving the

fact that it's Lowrey's turn at errand boy. So Lowrey...

Say, why don't you rent a movie or

somethin'? Uh-huh.

You're so silly.

Burnett's burning now.

I'm you, remember?

BURNETT

You don't even know where you're

Lowrey follows Burnett to the next aisle, where Burnett

gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.

BURNETT

You think you know what Theresa

needs, man, but I do this every

month.

Just look for 'Fresh Days.'

Lowrey moves ahead.   There's too much to look at.

LOWREY

You're unbalanced. Listen, I

read the parole jacket on this

guy Noah. Armed robbery.

Attempted murder. He's a violent

offender somethin' like nine

times. Sweet guy. Not a single

drug bust on his sheet.

So? He's a new recruit. Keep

looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'

dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright orange vests

and caps reading "Water and Power." And as Lowrey knocks

on the door.

CLOSE ON HEAVY LINK CHAIN

Wrapped around a pink refrigerator.    It moves.

BURNETT

What do you think the chain's for?

LOWREY

I dunno. Maybe some kind of

hurricane anchor.

They knock again.    The chain jerks slightly.

BURNETT

Well, the anchor just moved.

Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,

it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and

the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From

around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and

Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as

a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at

the deck.

The door swings open.

Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

Listen. The cat don't belong to

me. It belong to my brother. And

I don't know where he is.

That's too bad. Because his

lion's tied to your trailer. So

you gotta move the beast. Or move

the trailer.

WOMAN

Move the trailer? Move it to

where?

LOWREY

Everglades. Only part of South

Florida that's zoned for Wild

Kingdom shit. 'Course, the crocks

down there'll probably eat your

brother's cat.

him from a little kitty!

for Mike. And when she hears about

how he's been taking care of --

Off the couch!

Lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom. One of the dogs

runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both

follow him into the bedroom.

stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.

CASPER

Sorry.   Never heard of him.

Too bad.

Burnett shrugs, zips and reaches to flush when --

CLOSE ON GARBAGE BAG

Which Casper wraps around Burnett's head.       Burnett gags.

CASPER

Okay, hardon!    Tell me where the

girl is!

Casper slams Burnett into the mirror. Burnett struggles,

reaching for anything, he comes up with the towel dis-

penser, rips it from the wall and starts pounding over

Casper's head.

146   INT. BAR                                                        146

Lowrey sips on a beer, totally unaware of what's

happening on the other side of the fishtank.

Burnett rips the bag off his head, reaches for his gun.

But Casper's there, lunging into him and lifting him up

and into the fishtank.

148   INT. BAR - LOWREY                                               148

He's been watching the  fish in the tank, but turns back

toward the bar just at  the moment of Burnett's impact.

The tank cracks on the  bathroom side and water begins

draining, unbeknownst  to Lowrey.

Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea-

weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding

across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching

for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late.

Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and

squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett

in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's

head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett

picks up his gun.

Now where's my no good, no back-up

partner?

Through the busted fishtank, Burnett catches sight of

Lowrey, standing at the bar and making conversation with

one of the club beauties.

A152   INT. CLUB HELL - OPPOSITE BAR                                A152

Ferguson and Noah split wide and start their move on

heading right for him.

153    INT. CLUB HELL OFFICE - FOUCHET                              153

He's watching Ferguson and Noah moving in for the kill

Lowrey meets Julie halfway. He's got her by the arm and

is shouting over the loud music.

LOWREY

What the hell are you doing here?

JULIE

The guy who killed Max.   I remember

something he said!

Guns with silencers held tight to their sides.

JULIE

Three little angels! The guy who

Julie sees Noah and freezes.

LOWREY

The music's too loud.    What you

Noah closes the gap.    Through the crowd he draws down on

Lowrey.

156   INT. CLUB DANCE FLOOR                                        156

Julie pulls the gun from her purse, shuts her eyes and

starts FIRING wildly.

BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM!

The gun bucks and each shot goes wildly high.   Noah dives

for the floor.

The room clears around Julie. Noah is back on his feet,

once again with the gun. But...

LOWREY

Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the

frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah.

Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun

skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't

find it. But --

FERGUSON'S

got a clear shot at Julie. He raises his gun, only to

find Burnett's pistol at his ear.

Don't even think about it.

Julie?

Burnett sees that Noah's on the run. So he cold-cocks

Ferguson with the butt of his pistol and joins the chase.

Appear at the door, charging down the steps toward the

valet and commandering a Taurus that just pulled up.

All three dive in. Burnett behind the wheel.

LOWREY

Lemme drive!

BURNETT

I'm driving.     Buckle up.

Burnett hits the gas, the CAR SCREAMS around in a tight

circle just as -- SLAM! -- Noah's sedan backs wildly

across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN

over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear

window. BLAM! Everybody ducks. Safety glass flies

before Noah shifts gears and drives on.

Noah's already up to 70 MPH, races through a yellow

You're gonna drive through that,

aren't you?

Burnett does, hauling through the light. Meanwhile,

Lowrey has the bubble light in hand, reaches out the

window to stick it on the roof, but it simply slides off.

He reels it back in the car and hands it off to Julie.

LOWREY

Hold that.

Both speeding cars, side by side. Then Noah cranks the

the divider. But --

NOAH

His wheels catch the island and the snaps, and rolls

right into --

CLOSED GAS STATION

Noah's car clips the pumps. A geyser of gasoline sprays

into the sky. Noah recovers from the roll. Throws his

Burnett keeps moving and grousing while Lowrey chases

Julie down and snags her by the arm.

Hey, hey. Just relax!

Okay. It's true this whole thing

started with missing drugs. But

She got killed. And I'm not gonna

lay down until this guy is dead

or put away... And I promise you,

we'll take care of you.

JULIE

That's what I'm afraid of.

Once again, Julie pulls away. But Lowrey's got her

tight... and close. He digs deep.

I need you.

Magic words.   Julie's swayed, despite herself.

Police units surround  -- flashing lights. Julie is

shaken, waiting in the  back of a police unit. Meanwhile,

Ruiz and Sanchez join  Burnett and Lowrey at the trunk of

the toasted car. The   fire crew crowbars open the lid.

The trunk gives way to  a ghastly, toxic smell. Everyone

gags.

there?

LOWREY

Smells like some kinda chemical.

not Marcus. You can take my word

close with a look that says "saved." But then as he

moves. Something CREAKS.

193    INT. THERESA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                             193

Theresa hears SOMETHING and runs to the door and calls

out.

THERESA

Mike!

In a heartbeat, Lowrey charges into Theresa's room in his

underwear.

LOWREY

What's the matter?

THERESA

I heard a noise... I think

someone's outside...

A194   EXT. AWNING - BURNETT                                      A194

Seemingly stuck, once again, he attempts to move.

Another, even LOUDER CREAK, then --

AWNING

gives way. And Burnett crashes loudly into the garbage

cans underneath. Lids and cans go every which way.

B194   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                                      B194

A lid rolls down and into the street.

C194   INT./EXT. CASPER'S CAR - NIGHT                             C194

Casper and Ferguson look curiously as the lid rolls into

194    EXT. UNDER AWNING - BURNETT - NIGHT                        194

He crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage

He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night-

196   EXT. SIDE YARD - BURNETT                                     196

LOWREY

Go into the kids' room, turn the

I come get you.

198   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     198

Lowrey takes gun from holster, slams in clip.

199   EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT                                      199

Lowrey switches off the porch lights as he exits house,

gun ready. Without warning, Burnett leaps from the

bushes onto Lowrey's back.

LOWREY'S GUN

Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow,

dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and

clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun.

Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --

CAR

drives past.   The headlights, revealing Burnett.

LOWREY

Marcus!   What the fuck --

BURNETT

LOWREY

What?   Me and Theresa?

BURNETT

I hope you used protection...

Lowrey and the two roll around on the lawn.

And I suppose this isn't here?

You were going to put Snail Guard

THERESA (O.S.)

Mike?   Are you okay!

LOWREY

I'm fine, Theresa!

(whispers)

Will you get the hell out of here

before she sees you! You're

supposed to be in Cleveland.

BURNETT

Yeah, I wouldn't want to spoil

your little arrangement!

LOWREY

And where's Julie? You didn't

leave her again.

BURNETT

She's in the car. Got her cuffed

to the steering wheel.

Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing

Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the

front door.

LOWREY

(through grit teeth)

Now, listen to me. Look over my

right shoulder. What do you see

... I said look!

BURNETT

(looks)

Late model Ford. Two occupants.

LOWREY

Good. So who do you think's in

there? Ed McMahon come to tell

us we're sweepstakes winners?

BURNETT

Okay.   What are we doing about it?

LOWREY

We're doing nothing. I've got it

handled. In the meantime, you

better get back to where you

belong before I shoot you myself.

Lowrey holds and watches Burnett run off to the Porsche,

keeping the sedan in his periphery the entire time.

CUT TO:

202    EXT. STREET - PORSCHE - NIGHT                                  202

It pulls out and drives right past the sedan.    Julie

in full, animated view.

203    INT. SEDAN - FERGUSON AND CASPER                               203

Casper sees the girl.

CASPER

Sonofabitch!   There's the girl!

But just as they start the car.    KUH-THUNK -- the

CAR lurches.

FERGUSON

What the fuck?

204    EXT. BURNETT'S STREET - NIGHT                                  204

A tow truck has pulled up to the sedan and hooked it.

Sanchez operates the winch and Ruiz GUNS the ENGINE.

SANCHEZ

Let's go!

The tow truck hauls away Ferguson and Casper stuck in

the sedan.

CUT TO:

A205   EXT. BURNETTT HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LOWREY                      A205

On the front lawn. Satisfied grin on his face, he

returns to the house.

205    EXT. ORANGE BOWL STADIUM - NIGHT                               205

The tow truck wheels into the stadium and stops.

Ferguson and Casper try to make their break, but the

scene suddenly ignites as the Orange Bowl lights go on.

Squad cars and about ten cops surround with guns and

batons. Ruiz and Sanchez step from the tow truck.

206    INT. LOWREY BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT                            206

Burnett enters with Julie in tow. He looks defeated,

grass stains on his clothes, mussed hair. And here comes

Chet.

CHET

'Evening, Mr. Lowrey. May I have

a word with you?

(pulls him aside)

I was thinking that... maybe I

could see your gun. See, we

don't allow guns up in the

apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually

checks his, here, at the desk

with me... You want me to check

yours?

Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet.        He

sticks it in Chet's face.

CHET

Oh, okay.   It's just an option.

Burnett grabs Julie's hand and heads for the elevators.

A207   INT. NARCOTICS DIVISION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY                      A207

A cigar-smoking Sinclair supervises the lock-down of the

Special Narcotics Unit. Desks are being locked by IA

suits.

BURNETT AND LOWREY

enter.   Just as file cabinets are hand-trucked by them.

BURNETT

Hey.   What's goin' on here?

LOWREY

Wait a minute. That's my desk!

Lowrey's going to make a move on Sinclair when Howard

appears.

We're all being reassigned until

their investigation is over. In

Howard pushes them into --

HOWARD'S OFFICE

Where Ruiz and Sanchez wait with one of last night's

Henchmen. His face is horribly bruised.

SANCHEZ

He says he wants his lawyer.

RUIZ

Yeah, but we told him we were

desperate men without no fuckin'

jobs, so...

(prods the guy)

So?

HENCHMAN

Okay. All I know is his name.

Foo-shay, I think. Got this

heavy French accent. The word

was he offs drug dealers. And

there was quick cash for whoever

had the balls enough to hook up

with him. I swear, man, watchin'

your house was my first gig for

the guy.

Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated

chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy

one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised

face proves punishment enough.

BURNETT

Yeah. I guess you're tellin'

the truth.

HOWARD

I also got the lab report from

the stuff you picked up in Noah's

He hands it off.

You'd need whole lotta time cards

to make that kinda date.

white boy with rasta dreadlocks.

BURNETT

Hey, Jojo.

Through the office window, Jojo sees Burnett and sud-

denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into

Lowrey, who body checks him back up against the office

door.

LOWREY

Good runnin' into you, Jojo.

BURNETT

Hey, calm down. A little rap,

that's all. We're lookin' for

someone who can step on a

shitload of heroin. And do it

real fast, and real well.

We're lookin' for a pro.

Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey

gun and points it at Burnett.

Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey.

Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is

deadly until Julie breaks the silence.

JULIE

So where's the coffee and donuts?

BURNETT

What?

JULIE

I thought that was the usual menu

when cops were on stakeout. A

little caffeine for the heart.

Some sugar-coated dough fried in

day old grease.

LOWREY

Man. Will you get off this?

You're making me sick.

JULIE

Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these

hours on the case, you must    miss

Theresa's home cooking.

(near Lowrey's ear)

Bet last night she fixed you    up

something yummy and left it    in

the microwave for you.

Burnett starts to steam.

LOWREY

Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.

JULIE

I imagine there was something

yummy waiting for you when you

finally made it to bed --

BURNETT

Listen, lady --

But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their

rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror.

He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and

TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the

unmarked sedan.

Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend

Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...

TOWNE

Well, what do we have back here?

Looks like we got us two pimps

and a hooker.

DE SOUZA

Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does

us both we'll let you leave with

your pride intact.

LOWREY

Excuse me. One moment.

(rolls up the window)

Let's fuck with these bozos.

Burnett nods his approval.   Lowrey lowers the window.

LOWREY

Now, where were we?

TOWNE

Outta the car. Hands where we can

see 'em. Feet spread.

Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett

respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out

and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking

Burnett's shoulders.

BURNETT

Oh, that's not how you frisk a

potential lawbreaker. You gotta

start at the waistband. See if

he's carrying a piece.

Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to

Burnett's waistband where he feels a --

TOWNE

Gun!

Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces

drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

You know, it would be very bad

But it would be even worse if you

shot two policemen and their

witness on a stakeout.

Looks pass between the hobby cops.

LOWREY

Now I'm reaching slowly for my

shield... very slowly... here it

comes... just about got it...

Ooh, look at that. It's a

shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't

fuck with somebody who had one of

these in his pocket. So... Let's

see. I guess that makes us

policemen. And you...

BURNETT

Not.

He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns,

unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.

BURNETT

Now, some rent-a-cops have

licenses to carry weapons,  where

others do not. Which might   you

be? You wouldn't happen to   have

those permits handy, would  you?

From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see

that they don't.

she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in

the ship. But as he disappears, Casper appears with his

own pair of binoculars.

221   INT. STAKEOUT CAR (BOATYARD) - MORNING                      221

BURNETT

They've made us. Let's move.

Lowrey FLOORS it.

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                               96.

222   INT. LOWREY AND BURNETT'S CAR - EN ROUTE - MORNING          222

Lowrey's driving in his typical, pedal to the metal

style while Burnett talks on the radio.

BURNETT

Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble

the troops. We just made the

dope lab. We'll be at the P.D.

in one hour.

JULIE

So what am I gonna do?

LOWREY

You're gonna keep your sweet ass

nice and quiet back at my place.

JULIE

What?

LOWREY

Mike's place.     I said Mike's.

Lowrey rolls his eyes.    He can't wait for this to end.

223   INT. BURNETT KITCHEN - MORNING                              223

Typical pandemonium. Theresa is making/serving breakfast

while the TV BLARES. Quincy is channel surfing on the

TV when he comes up with the news footage of the

explosion, followed by more footage of Lowrey, Julie, and

Burnett at the scene.

QUINCY

Hey, it's Dad and Uncle Mike.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)

In our continuing report on police

violence, the most recent incident

involving two Miami P.D. officers

remains unexplained by department

spokesmen. This high-speed chase

was captured two nights ago by

our Live Copter 9 news team. And

while the driver was killed, both

police officers involved in the

incident seemed to escape without

injury.

THERESA

Kids, you go over to the

neighbors' house. I'll be right

back.

JULIE

Where you going?

THERESA

Mommy's going to Cleveland.

224   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - LOWREY, BURNETT, AND JULIE - DAY     224

Bang, they're through the door.   Grubby and tired from

the all-night stakeout.

225   INT. LOBBY - MORNING                                       225

Theresa enters building, ignores Chet and heads straight

for bank of elevators.

CHET

Lady, all visitors must be

announced.

THERESA

Announce this!

In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's

dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole

way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator

lock. Theresa lets  go.

226   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - DAY                                  226

Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly

watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for

the bust.

JULIE

So, I guess when you get back, it's

gonna be over.

LOWREY

That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan

some of those ass kicking clothes.

BURNETT

Third drawer down.

(as doorbell rings)

Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see

who that is.

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                                98.

227   INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               227

Julie looks through the peephole, then opens the door.

And there's Theresa. Julie's hip.

JULIE

Which one do you want?     The tall

one or the short one?

THERESA

Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em

both. But it's the short one I'm

gonna divorce.

She pushes past.

JULIE

Thought so.

Julie watches Theresa charge headlong into --

228   INT. CONDO - BEDROOM - DAY                                   228

Burnett's stripped to his pants and T-shirt. While

Lowrey's down to his white boxer shorts. He's talking

and wiping down his gun with a rag.

LOWREY

Man, I can't wait to see the look

on Howard's face when we tell

him...

(seeing Theresa)

Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey.

THERESA

Save your crap, Mike.

LOWREY

Mike what?     What'd he do?

BURNETT

Theresa.     It's not how it looks.

THERESA

It ain't Cleveland, neither.

LOWREY

Where's Julie?

Lowrey pushes past Theresa into --

229   INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               229

Where Julie is gone!    The front door is wide open.

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            99.

230   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - ELEVATORS - DAY                       230

Julie's inside. She hits the close door button.    But

Lowrey's there to catch it.

LOWREY

Julie. We wanted to tell you...

I especially wanted to tell you --

JULIE

You think I didn't know? God, you

are so stupid! And to think I let

you use me like you did, Max.

Why?

LOWREY

Julie --

JULIE

Wait. I know why. Because you

said you needed me. Jesus, who's

the stupid one now?

LOWREY

We still need you.

He reaches for her.

JULIE

Fuck you!

Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator

doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the

corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the

elevator button.

THERESA

You stayed away from home just one

night too many, Marcus.

BURNETT

Theresa. She's a material witness!

It was orders!

231   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - LOBBY - DAY                           231

The elevator doors open and Julie makes for exit. She

sees a cab parked outside, slips back on her spiked heel

and starts to run for it when --

FOUCHET

enters, with Casper and Ferguson to either side.

(CONTINUED)

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            99A.

231   CONTINUED:   (A1)                                          231

They sweep into the lobby, stalling just inside the

doorway when they realize that their target is right

there in front of them, frozen like a deer caught in the

proberbial headlights.

To the right and left, people at the mailboxes. Chet

on the phone behind the desk. But he's looking at

Julie. Then...

FOUCHET

Grab her.

But the doors to the second elevator open.

(CONTINUED)

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                                100.

231   CONTINUED:                                                  231

Burnett and Lowrey step out in time to see Julie

looking to them and the bad guys about to make their

move.

WIDE SHOT FROM ABOVE

Fouchet and his henchmen LEFT. Burnett and Lowrey to

the RIGHT. And Julie in the MIDDLE. Fouchet is the

first one to draw down.

LOWREY

Julie!   Drop now!

Pandemonium.

GUNS drawn and BLAZING. All three villains, plus Burnett

and Lowrey, diving and FIRING.

PEOPLE IN LOBBY

Scream and duck for cover.     Smoke and plaster fill the

air.

BURNETT

Pushes Theresa back into the elevator, making her lay on

the floor as BULLETS CUT above.

LOWREY

Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ past.

JULIE

On floor.    In the middle.   Crawling for cover when --

FOUCHET

With balls the size of Pennsylvania. Two GUNS in hand,

walks forward with barrels fixed and FIRING. Clips out

on one, tosses the gun aside, then, with his free hand,

reaches down and grabs Julie by the hair and lifts her

until she stands.

FOUCHET

Let's go!

(CONTINUED)

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                                101.

231    CONTINUED:   (2)                                          231

With a gun in her side, he backs away and shoves her

through the exit. Casper and Ferguson follow.

LOWREY

Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and running after

them.

LOWREY

Julie!!!!

Meanwhile --

232    INT. LOWREY LOBBY - ELEVATOR - BURNETT AND THERESA        232

Into the open elevator, Burnett slides his gun over to

her.

BURNETT

Go upstairs. And don't let anybody

in but me... Do it!

Burnett presses the close door button. The doors close

just as Theresa reaches for him, calling --

THERESA

Marcus, I love you.

233    EXT. LOWREY'S CONDO - DAY                                 233

Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad

guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey

makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't

even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,

he appears from the building, turns the corner out the

door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off

bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.

A234   EXT./INT. FOUCHET'S CAR (INTERSECTION) - DAY              A234

Fouchet's car slides into the intersection and stalled

traffic. To the right: a footbridge. The car swings a

hard right.

234    EXT. FOOTBRIDGE                                           234

Where a male nurse pushing an old man in a wheelchair are

in the way. SLAM! The nurse tumbles up and into

Fouchet's windshield.

(CONTINUED)

102.

234   CONTINUED:                                               234

WHEELCHAIR

Empty and spinning.

235   EXT. OTHER END OF FOOTBRIDGE                             235

Metal pylons imbedded in concrete.

FOUCHET

Out of the car!

The doors fly open and all three are out in the middle

of the stalled traffic, Julie being drug along with

them. The gang cuts down an alley.

236   EXT. ALLEY - LOWREY                                      236

Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods.

He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet

and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running.

237   EXT. ALLEY - BURNETT                                     237

Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another

direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.

238   INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY                                  238

MUZAK. Old ladies getting their hair blued and curled

when -- BANG! Fouchet and the gang enter. Curlers fly.

Screams!

LOWREY

enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES.

BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey

ends up under an old lady's dress.

239   EXT. OCEAN BLVD. (SOUTH BEACH)                           239

Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a

crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their

way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments

behind, pushing his way through the same path.

103.

240   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          240

Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first

car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab

and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of

the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.

He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the

dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and

Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241

But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no

gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets

into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.

242   INSIDE CAB                                                 242

Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire

into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING

out sideways.

243   EXT./INT. CAB                                              243

BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet

stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and

onto the pavement.

CLOSE ON BURNETT

He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg

gives way.

FOUCHET

He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels

at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,

about to become instant roadkill.

Then --

244   EXT. STREET                                                244

From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out

across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the

deadly grille of the cab.

(CONTINUED)

104.

244   CONTINUED:                                                244

TAXI CAB

hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of

their own, both trying to catch their breath.

LOWREY

Don't ever say I wasn't there for

you.

245   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - DAY                           245

TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars.

All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their

unmarked car. Howard approaches.

HOWARD

It's about fuckin' time.

BURNETT

We lost the girl.

HOWARD

But you found the dope, right?

So let's go get it back.

A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a

BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze

of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and

Howard.

BOY

Which one of you's Lowrey?   I got

somethin' for him.

LOWREY

At least I'm me again.

(hand out)

I'm Lowrey.

From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip

PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power

button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.

LOWREY

(presses send)

Yeah.   This is Lowrey.

246   INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - DAY                           246

While dope is lifted and loaded from the open hold,

Fouchet is revealed at the other end of the cellular

call.

FOUCHET

I have something for you to listen

to.

Fouchet lifts his PISTOL and FIRES a single shot.   BAM!

INTERCUT WITH --

247   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY                         247

He jolts at the sound of GUNFIRE.

248   INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - FOUCHET                        248

Where the CAMERA SWISH PANS ACROSS TO a very dead Elliot.

FOUCHET

That bullet just killed the

chemist. Now, I have but four

hours left to make my deal. Fuck

with my timetable and the next

bullet kills the girl.

Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared

shitless.

249   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY                         249

He's in a vice.    Duty or the girl.   Then --

LOWREY

You twisted motherfucker...

(then...)

Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get

my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna

kill you.

(hangs up)

The snitch who tipped us to the

dope lab? Turns out to be a

bogus address.

BURNETT

Bogus address?

HOWARD

How's this? I'll kill the little

prick for you. That's cuz you're

already dead.

(waves at the

troops)

Okay, you guys. Put 'em back in

the lockers.

(CONTINUED)

106.

249   CONTINUED:                                                249

En masse, all the cops act as if the wind had been

knocked from their sails.

250   INT. LOW-DOWN BAR - DAY                                   250

Empty, save for the daytime regulars at the bar and

Burnett and Lowrey in a rear booth.

BURNETT

How'd he know we were gearing up

to go? It's like he's known all

along where we're gonna be and

when.

LOWREY

You know that once he sells the

dope, he's gonna kill her just

like he did Max.

BURNETT

Three little angels. Julie kept

talking about his three little

angels.

A barkeeper appears with two beers.   Burnett automati-

cally reaches for his wallet.

CLOSE ON BURNETT'S WALLET

Where out pops a picture of his three children.

LOWREY

If she dies, I'm done with it.

The whole cop thing.

BURNETT

kids)

Three little angels.

251   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                     251

Francine is at her file desk. Looking pretty much the

same as always. Same smile. Same easy manner. Then

the CAMERA REVOLVES AROUND her and SETTLES ON those

pictures on her desk. Her three little boys --

including the one in uniform. The CAMERA TILTS TO --

LOWREY AND BURNETT

standing over her desk.

251   CONTINUED:                                                251

Neither of them smiling.

FRANCINE

Hey, fellahs. What's the joke.

(as she gets nothing

back)

Really. I want to know.

Soon, though, the facade fades.   Francine knows she's

been caught.

252   INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY                                   252

Burnett holds the door while Lowrey holds Francine.

She's broken, crying, and giving up the ghost of her

past.

FRANCINE

It was a birthday party... You

know, after hours. Just the

civilian staff... We were drinking.

And everybody. They all had boy

friends or their husbands.

LOWREY

So you were alone?

FRANCINE

He was so nice to me. He said I

was beautiful, too. I guess I

wanted to believe him...

(then ashamed,

starting to shake)

He took some horrible pictures of

me. I don't remember any of it.

I'd had too much to drink. I

wondered if he'd drugged me.

Later... he threatened to show

them to my boys... my little

angels. Said he'd pin the

pictures up on the grade school

bulletin boards for all their

classmates to see if I didn't do

what he wanted.

BURNETT

He wanted someone inside the P.D.?

FRANCINE

At first, it was about drug busts.

Dealers under surveillance.

FRANCINE (CONT'D)

He'd steal from them before we

could make the case. And then when

the department gave the air

conditioning to Mr. Orona...

BURNETT

Anything you can tell us about him?

FRANCINE

What do you say about someone who

rips off drug dealers? A man

like that ain't scared of nobody.

Not the police. Not you guys.

Nobody.

(beat)

He's the scariest man I ever met.

LOWREY

Yeah. But does he still trust

what you tell him?

253   EXT. BOATYARD - DAY                                        253

Fouchet is supervising the loading of the dope onto three

He's surprised to hear from Francine.

FOUCHET

Yes, Francine... What is it?

FRANCINE

Miami P.D.'s called in the D.E.A.

task force. They know the deal's

going down in just two hours. So

they've deployed agents to every

point of entry, airports, marinas,

etc...

FOUCHET

Is that all?

FRANCINE

Yes.

FOUCHET

I'm very pleased, Francine.

You're the best pet I've ever

had.

He hangs up.

Back in the van Lowrey turns to Sanchez.

267   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        267

Two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this

massive, five-story hangar to reveal a C-123 cargo

aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.

268   EXT. ORANGE HIGHWAY - DAY                                  268

The surveillance van is parked at the side of the road.

269   INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY                                269

THROUGH a floor-mounted SPOTTING SCOPE we see the last of

the trucks roll into Hangar 3 and two of the buyer's

henchmen shut the doors.

BURNETT

That's it. That's where they're

making the deal.

Burnett swivels the spotting scope.

270   EXT. ORANGE CITY AIRFIELD - SCOPE'S POV                    270

PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS the landscape of tall reeds

and distant buildings. Finally he STALLS ON a garbage

truck and its four-man crew rolling dumpsters.

271   INT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        271

Fouchet shakes  hands with the BUYER. Upon which time one

forklift begins  to drive pallets full of cash from the

open cargo door  of the aircraft while another drives

pallets full of  dope.

BUYER

Three hundred million and very,

very fresh. Too much to count,

eh?

ON JULIE

As Casper pulls her from the rear of a truck and

handcuffs her to the door of a cab.

BUYER

Who's the bimbo?

FOUCHET

Simply part of another

transaction.

(CONTINUED)

112.

271   CONTINUED:                                                 271

The operation moves swiftly. Dope pallets for cash

pallets. Smooth, just like the original heist. Two fuel

trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft.

272   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                        272

Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the

garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS Ruiz and

Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging

from the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits

and protective masks.

273   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        273

The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the

oncoming truck. Their hands slip inside their coats to

MP5-Ks slung under their armpits. But --

274   EXT. HANGAR 3 - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY                        274

It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters.

With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and

Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop

from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city

amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They

wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting

forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and

dumped into the truck.

CLOSE ON DUMPSTER

As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The

hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck

in the air.

RUIZ AND SANCHEZ

Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this

fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough.       He

tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off    as

if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right     for

the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving    and

spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing

what to think. Ready for anything when --

CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING.

Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with

guns at the base of their necks.

113.

274   CONTINUED:                                                 274

BURNETT

Mouths shut, feet moving.    Now,

walk.

275   EXT. HANGAR #3 - ANGLE ON DUMPSTER                         275

As it lifts once again to the air, this time dumping the

two henchmen into the truck.

ANGLE - HIGH ABOVE TRUCK

As the human garbage is deposited.

276   INT. HANGAR 3 - C-123 - DAY                                276

The Buyer buckles himself into the pilot's seat of the C-

123. His crew shuts the cargo hatches and he gives a

pleased salute to Fouchet. The ENGINES TURN OVER and the

propellers move. Meanwhile --

277   INT. HANGAR 3 - TRUCK ENGINES                              277

START. Loaded with cash, they're ready to go.   Fouchet

gives the signal to open the doors.

CASPER AND FERGUSON

Move to open the doors. They give a good shove.   Still

nothing. So they bang and shout.

CASPER

Hey! Wake up out there!     Open

it up!

278   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        278

One of the dumpsters is parked in front of the doors.   No

exit.

279   INT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        279

Just as Casper and Ferguson give a helpless look to

Fouchet...

114.

280   INT. HANGAR 3 - ANGLE ACROSS HANGAR - DAY                280

The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall,

instantly colliding with the left wing section of

aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft

twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.

281   INT. C-123 (HANGAR 3) - ON BUYER                         281

Tossed from his seat and thrown across throttle.   The

ENGINE ROARS!

282   INT. HANGAR - ONE CANVAS-BACKED TRUCK                    282

The tarpaulin rips and a pallet of cash busts open.

Money swirls inside the hangar.

283   INT./EXT. C-123 - CARGO DOORS                            283

Open.   Henchmen ready to kill.   Then --

284   FROM EMPTY DUMPSTER                                      284

Pop up Burnett and Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE

the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest of the Buyer's

henchmen.

CASPER AND FERGUSON

charge.   GUNS BLASTING.

BULLETS

RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab.

Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side.

Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.

LOWREY

Move it or lose it!

Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run.

Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and

aim, but...

KUH-WHOOM!

The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers

dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.

115.

285   INT. AIRCRAFT (HANGAR 3)                                     285

Inside the aircraft the precious dope catches fire.

286   INT. HANGAR 3 - ON CASPER AND FERGUSON                       286

Looking through the flames. Shielding their eyes.     Ruiz

and Sanchez appear from behind.

SANCHEZ

Remember us?

The two bad guys turn with their guns. The flames

igniting their already battered faces. But they don't

turn fast enough. Both cops FIRE in unison. Ferguson

and Casper fall. PULL BACK --

287   INT. HANGAR 3 - WIDE ANGLE                                   287

One aircraft ENGINE still ROARING. The money swirling

and burning, falling from the roof like a fiery rain.

And --

288   INT. HANGAR 3 - LOWREY AND BURNETT                           288

Easing through the wreckage, ever-so-cautious.

LOWREY

Julie!

JULIE (O.S.)

Michael!

Her VOICE ECHOES.

CUT TO:

289   INT. HANGAR 3 - FOUCHET                                      289

He's handcuffed himself to Julie, dragging her deeper

and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker

and swirling with the burning cash.

290   INT. HANGAR 3 - BURNETT AND LOWREY                           290

Signals between the two. They split wider.   Moving

toward those locked doors.

291   INT. HANGAR 3 - BACK ON FOUCHET                              291

At the locked doors. He shoves against them in a futile

rage. Julie begins to choke on the fumes.

116.

292   INT. HANGAR 3 - SEPARATE SHOTS - BURNETT AND LOWREY          292

Each placing their faces against their own sleeves.    The

smoke is thicker, swirling in waves.

293   INT. HANGAR - DOORS - FOUCHET                                293

Shoving the doors.   Pushing and pushing.    Then --

294   FROM HAIL OF SMOKE AND BURNING CASH                          294

Appear Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and

closing. Guns carefully aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie

close.

FOUCHET

I was going to fuck her, then

kill her. Now it looks like I'm

only going to do the latter.

LOWREY

Either we O.D. on the air or

the whole place blows. We're

dying anyway.

BURNETT

Let her go and you'll walk. You

can keep the dope and the money.

(coughs)

Just the girl and we all get out

of here.

FOUCHET

What if I don't have the key.

JULIE

He threw it in the --

FOUCHET

(yanks her)

Shut up! It's gone. She's dead.

Unless you move aside.

Burnett eases further right. Gun carefully aimed. His

eyes are stinging. Lowrey goes left. But he's lowering

his gun.

FOUCHET

Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head. Looking to

Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding

for her to --

117.

294   CONTINUED:                                                  294

LOWREY

Drop, Julie!

She drops.    Burnett has a clear shot when --

295   HANGAR DOORS                                                295

Swing wide and way, way open. Blinding light. NOISE.

HELICOPTERS. And about fifty cops at the ready. Rounds

chambered. Rifles leveled.

296   QUICK SHOTS                                                 296

Fouchet, Julie, Lowrey, Burnett. All with the same idea.

They bolt for daylight as fast as they can go because --

297   HANGAR                                                      297

EXPLODES in such a concussion it knocks all four of them

to the dirt. The hangar crumbles.

298   EXT. HANGAR - CLOSE ON BURNETT                              298

As he looks back on the conflagration.

BURNETT

Sanchez and Ruiz...

Then --

FOUCHET WITH JULIE

He yanks her back up onto her feet, wild-eyed.   He's

still got the gun on her.

LOWREY

(hands up for all

the cops to see)

Don't shoot!!! Hold your fire!!!

FOUCHET

Twisting Julie for all to see.    The cops' rifle sights,

all glinting in the sun.

FOUCHET

I'll kill the girl!!!

Fouchet raises Julie's hand high in the air to show all

of them the handcuffs when -- KA-POW! -- a SHOT RINGS

OUT.

CLOSE ON CUFFS

The link is snapped in two by the bullet.    Julie falls

to the ground. While --

BURNETT AND LOWREY

UNLOAD their CLIPS in a CRESCENDO of GUNFIRE.    Fouchet

crumples in a heap.

CUT TO:

299   EXT. HANGAR - HOWARD                                       299

The eye behind the smoking sniper rifle.    He reveals a

pleasured smile.

HOWARD

Swish.

Then he turns to Sinclair, who stands only feet away.

HOWARD

Investigate that, asshole.

300   EXT. HANGAR - JULIE                                        300

She finds her feet and runs to Lowrey. Right into his

arms. He holds her tight, but she winces from a nasty

cut on her shoulder.

JULIE

Ow.     This shit really hurts.

LOWREY

Stick around. I'll give you a

bullet to bite.

Finally --

SANCHEZ AND RUIZ

They appear.   Alive and well. Big grins, helping Burnett

to his feet.   Brushing him off.

BURNETT

Hey, hey...

(then with a smile)

Let's go get our jobs back.

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             119.

301   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY                                     301

The front door opens and all the little Burnetts come

screaming out...

BURNETT KIDS

Daddy Daddy Daddy the hero!!!

... into the arms of their father.     He gathers them all

into one big hug.

BURNETT

Daddy's home!

Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm.

The kids run to...

BURNETT KIDS

Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.

Then...

BURNETT

Baby!

Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in

the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up

the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa

tossing a wink Lowrey's way.

LOWREY

Manana, partner. Peace. Okay,

kids. Pile in. And watch the

leather and windows this time?

JULIE

You got a real way with kids,

Lowrey.

LOWREY

You see anybody complaining?

BURNETT

Hey.    Where are the kids goin'?

THERESA

Didn't you know? We got us a new

babysitter.

She kisses him.

BURNETT

You mean...

THERESA

It's quality time, Marcus.

TO BLACK. Then UNDER CREDITS:
