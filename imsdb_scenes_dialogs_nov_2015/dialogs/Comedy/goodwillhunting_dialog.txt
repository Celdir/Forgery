GOOD WILL HUNTING

"GOOD WILL HUNTING"

by

Matt Damon & Ben Affleck

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

Oh my God, I got the most fucked up

thing I been meanin' to tell you.

ALL

Oh Jesus. Here we go.

CHUCKIE

You guys know my cousin Mikey

Sullivan?

ALL

Yeah.

CHUCKIE

Well you know how he loves animals

right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin'

home...

(laughs)

ALL

What? Come on!

CHUCKIE

(trying not to laugh)

I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey,

the fuckin guy loves animals, and

this is the last person you'd want

this to happen to.

WILL

Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

CHUCKIE

Okay. He's driving along and this

fuckin' cat jumps in front of his

car, and so he hits this cat--

MORGAN

--That isn't funny--

CHUCKIE

--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"

And he looks in his rearview and

sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

BILLY

Fuckin' Chuckie!

CHUCKIE

So he sees this cat tryin to make it

across the street and it's not lookin'

so good.

WILL

It's walkin' pretty slow at this

point.

MORGAN

You guys are fuckin' sick.

CHUCKIE

So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put

this thing out of its misery"--So he

gets a hammer--

WILL/MORGAN/BILLY

OH!

CHUCKIE

out of his tool box, and starts

chasin' the cat and starts whackin'

it with the hammer. You know, tryin'

to put the thing out of its misery.

MORGAN

Jesus.

CHUCKIE

And all the time he's apologizin' to

the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG,

"I'm sorry." BANG!

BILLY

Like it can understand.

CHUCKIE

And this Samoan guy comes runnin'

out of his house and he's like "What

the fuck are you doing to my cat?!"

Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I

hit your cat with my truck, and I'm

just trying to put it out of it's

misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies.

So Mikey's like "Why don't you come

look at the front of the truck."

'Cause the other guy's all fuckin

flipped out about--

WILL

Watching his cat get brained.

CHUCKIE

Yeah, so he's like "Check the front

of my truck, I can prove I hit it

'cause there's probably some blood

or something"--

WILL

--or a tail--

MORGAN

WILL!

CHUCKIE

And so they go around to the front

of his truck... and there's another

cat on the grille.

WILL/MORGAN/BILLY

No! Ugh!

CHUCKIE

Is that unbelievable? He brained an

innocent cat!

BLACKOUT:

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Please finish McKinley by next month.

LAMBEAU

I'm hoping that one of you might

prove it by the end of the semester.

The first person to do so will not

only be in my good graces, but go on

to fame and fortune by having their

accomplishment recorded and their

name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T.

Tech."

LAMBEAU

Former winners include Nobel

Laureates, world renowned astro-

physicists, Field's Medal winners

and lowly M.I.T.  professors.

LAMBEAU

Okay. That is all.

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

Will!

CHUCKIE

You're gonna get charged!

WILL

You think I'm afraid of you, you big

fuck? You're crowdin' the plate.

CHUCKIE

Stop brushin' me back!

WILL

Stop crowdin the plate!

CHUCKIE

Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard.

We should go there sometime.

WILL

What are we gonna do up there?

CHUCKIE

I don't know, we'll fuck up some

smart kids.

(stepping back in)

You'd prob'ly fit right in.

WILL

Fuck you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STUDENT

Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?

LAMBEAU

Yes.

STUDENT

I'm in your applied theories class.

We're all down at the Math and Science

building.

LAMBEAU

It's Saturday.

STUDENT

I know. We just couldn't wait 'till

Monday to find out.

LAMBEAU

Find out what?

STUDENT

Who proved the theorem.

BILLY

Who's that? She's got a nice ass.

MORGAN

Yah, that is a nice ass.

CHUCKIE

You could put a pool in that backyard.

BILLY

Who's she talking to?

MORGAN

That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

WILL

Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat

the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.

BILLY

He's a pretty big kid.

WILL

Yah, he's the same size now as he

was in Kindergarten.

MORGAN

Fuck this, let's get something to

eat...

CHUCKIE

What Morgan, you're not gonna go

talk to her?

MORGAN

Fuck her.

WILL

I could go for a Whopper.

MORGAN

(nonchalant)

Let's hit "Kelly's."

CHUCKIE

Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's

Roast Beef" just cause you like the

take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes

out of our way.

MORGAN

What else we gonna do we can't spare

fifteen minutes?

CHUCKIE

All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell

you why we're not going to "Kelly's."

It's because the take-out bitch is a

fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like

her but she's dumb as a post and she

has never got our order right, never

once.

MORGAN

She's not stupid.

WILL

She's sharp as a marble.

CHUCKIE

We're not goin'.

(beat)

I don't even like "Kelly's."

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

This is correct? Who did this?

LAMBEAU

Nemesh?

NEMESH

No way.

LAMBEAU

Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll

find this one challenging enough to

merit coming forward with your

identity.  That is, if you can do

it.

MORGAN

Double Burger.

MORGAN

(same tone)

Double Burger.

MORGAN

I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger.

CHUCKIE

Would you shut the fuck up! I know

what you ordered, I was there!

MORGAN

So why don't you give me my sandwich?

CHUCKIE

What do you mean "your sandwich?" I

bought it.

MORGAN

(sarcastic)

Yah, all right...

CHUCKIE

How much money you got?

MORGAN

I told you, I just got change.

CHUCKIE

Well give me your fuckin' change and

we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on

layaway.

MORGAN

Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

CHUCKIE

I think you should establish a good

line of credit.

CHUCKIE

Oh motherfucker...

WILL

She didn't do it again did she?

CHUCKIE

Jesus Christ. Not even close.

MORGAN

Did she get my Double Burger?

CHUCKIE

NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!!

IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

WILL

Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone

even order a Flyin' Fish?

CHUCKIE

No, and we got four of 'em.

BILLY

You gotta' be kiddin' me. Why do we

even go to her?

CHUCKIE

Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush

on her, we always go there and when

we get to the window he never says a

fuckin' word to her, he never even

gets out of the car, and she never

gets our order right cause she's the

goddamn MISSING LINK!

WILL

Well, she out did herself today...

MORGAN

I don't got a crush on her.

CHUCKIE

What do we got?

WILL

I don't know yet.

MORGAN

Come on, Will...

CHUCKIE

Shut up.

MORGAN

No, why didn't you fight him at the

park if you wanted to? I'm not goin'

now, I'm eatin' my snack.

WILL

(smiles)

So don't go.

CHUCKIE

Morgan, Let's go.

MORGAN

I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.

CHUCKIE

(spins in his seat)

You're goin'. And if you're not out

there in two fuckin' seconds, when

I'm done with them you're next!

CUT TO:

WILL

(smiling, good

naturedly)

Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to

Kindergarten with you right? Sister

Margaret's class...

CHUCKIE

Hey, thanks for comin' out.

WILL

Yeah, you're all invited over to

Morgan's house for a complementary

fish sandwich.

WILL

(to Police)

Hey, I know it's not a French cruller,

but it's free.

WILL

Get the fuck off me!

CUT TO:

LANDLADY

Sean?

LANDLADY

Sean? You okay?

SEAN

Yeah.

LANDLADY

It's getting cold.

DISSOLVE:

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

When's the arraignment?

WILL

Next week.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Is it my imagination, or has my class

grown considerably?

LAMBEAU

I look around and see young people

who are my students, young people

who are not my students as well as

some of my colleagues. And by no

stretch of my imagination do I think

you've all come to hear me lecture.

LAMBEAU

But rather to ascertain the identity

of who our esteemed "The Tech" has

come to call "The Mystery Math

Magician."

LAMBEAU

Whoever you are, you've solved four

of the most difficult theorems I've

ever given a class. So without further

ado, come forward silent rogue, and

receive thy prize.

LAMBEAU

Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my

spectators, but it appears there

will be no unmasking here today. I'm

going to have to ask those of you

not enrolled in the class to make

your escape now or, for the next

three hours be subjected to the

mundities of eigenvectors.

LAMBEAU

However, my colleagues and I have

conferred. There is a problem on the

board, right now, that took us two

years to prove. So let this be said;

the gauntlet has been thrown down.

But the faculty have answered the

challenge and answered with vigor.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Excuse me!

WILL

Oh, I'm sorry.

LAMBEAU

What're you doing?

WILL

(walking away)

I'm sorry.

LAMBEAU

What's your name?

(beat)

Don't you walk away from me. This is

people's work, you can't graffiti

here.

WILL

Hey fuck you.

LAMBEAU

(flustered)

Well... I'll be speaking to your

supervisor.

LAMBEAU

My God.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

What happened?

(beat)

You got fired, huh?

WILL

Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

MORGAN

(starts laughing)

How fuckin' retarded do you have to

be to get shit-canned from that job?

How hard is it to push a fuckin'

broom?

CHUCKIE

You got fired from pushing a broom,

you little bitch.

MORGAN

Yah, that was different. Management

was restructurin'--

BILLY

Yah, restructurin' the amount of

retards they had workin' for them.

MORGAN

Fuck you, you fat fuck.

BILLY

Least I work for a livin'.

(to Will)

Why'd you get fired?

WILL

Management was restructurin'.

CHUCKIE

My uncle can probably get you on my

demo team.

MORGAN

What the fuck? I just asked you for

a job yesterday!

CHUCKIE

I told you "no" yesterday!

ALL

(one after another)

What's up Case.

CASEY

ID?

CHUCKIE

So, this is a Harvard bar, huh? I

thought there'd be equations and

shit on the wall.

CHUCKIE

Hey, how's it goin'?

LYDIA

Fine.

SKYLAR

Okay.

CHUCKIE

So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

LYDIA

Yes.

CHUCKIE

Yeah, cause I think I had a class

with you.

SKYLAR

What class?

CHUCKIE

Ah, history I think.

SKYLAR

Oh...

CHUCKIE

Yah, it's not a bad school...

CLARK

What class did you say that was?

CHUCKIE

History.

CLARK

How'd you like that course?

CHUCKIE

Good, it was all right.

CLARK

History? Just "history?" It must

have been a survey course then.

CLARK

Pretty broad. "History of the World?"

CHUCKIE

Hey, come on pal we're in classes

all day. That's one thing about

Harvard never seizes to amaze me,

everybody's talkin' about school all

the time.

CLARK

Hey, I'm the last guy to want to

talk about school at the bar. But as

long as you're here I want to "seize"

the opportunity to ask you a question.

CLARK

Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your

history class.

CHUCKIE

To tell you the truth, I wasn't there

much. The class was rather elementary.

CLARK

Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that

it was. I remember the class, it was

just between recess and lunch.

CHUCKIE

All right, are we gonna have a

problem?

CLARK

There's no problem. I was just hoping

you could give me some insight into

the evolution of the market economy

in the early colonies. My contention

is that prior to the Revolutionary

War the economic modalities especially

of the southern colonies could most

aptly be characterized as agrarian

precapitalist and...

WILL

Of course that's your contention.

You're a first year grad student.

You just finished some Marxian

historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly,

and so naturally that's what you

believe until next month when you

get to James Lemon and get convinced

that Virginia and Pennsylvania were

strongly entrepreneurial and

capitalist back in 1740. That'll

last until sometime in your second

year, then you'll be in here

regurgitating Gordon Wood about the

Pre-revolutionary utopia and the

capital-forming effects of military

mobilization.

CLARK

(taken aback)

Well, as a matter of fact, I won't,

because Wood drastically

underestimates the impact of--

WILL

"Wood drastically underestimates the

impact of social distinctions

predicated upon wealth, especially

inherited wealth..." You got that

from "Work in Essex County," Page

421, right? Do you have any thoughts

of your own on the subject or were

you just gonna plagiarize the whole

book for me?

WILL

Look, don't try to pass yourself off

as some kind of an intellect at the

expense of my friend just to impress

these girls.

WILL

The sad thing is, in about 50 years

you might start doin' some thinkin'

on your own and by then you'll realize

there are only two certainties in

life.

CLARK

Yeah? What're those?

WILL

One, don't do that.  Two -- you

dropped a hundred and fifty grand on

an education you coulda' picked up

for a dollar fifty in late charges

at the Public Library.

CLARK

But I will have a degree, and you'll

be serving my kids fries at a drive

through on our way to a skiing trip.

WILL

(smiles)

Maybe. But at least I won't be a

prick.

(beat)

And if you got a problem with that,

I guess we can step outside and deal

with it that way.

WILL

If you change your mind, I'll be

over by the bar.

MORGAN

My boy's wicked smart.

SKYLAR

You suck.

WILL

What?

SKYLAR

I've been sitting over there for

forty-five minutes waiting for you

to come talk to me. But I'm just

tired now and I have to go home and

I wasn't going to keep sitting there

waiting for you.

WILL

I'm Will.

SKYLAR

Skylar. And by the way. That guy

over there is a real dick and I just

wanted you to know he didn't come

with us.

WILL

I kind of got that impression.

SKYLAR

Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get

up early and waste some more money

on my overpriced education.

WILL

I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...

SKYLAR

Here's my number.

SKYLAR

Maybe we could go out for coffee

sometime?

WILL

Great, or maybe we could go somewhere

and just eat a bunch of caramels.

SKYLAR

What?

WILL

When you think about it, it's just

as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

SKYLAR

(laughs)

Okay, sounds good.

WILL

Five minutes.

SKYLAR

What?

WILL

I was trying to be smooth.

(indicates clock)

But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna

come over there and talk to you.

SKYLAR

See, it's my life story. Five more

minutes and I would have got to hear

your best pick-up line.

WILL

The caramel thing is my pick-up line.

SKYLAR

Glad I came over.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

There goes that fuckin' Barney right

now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip."

We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

WILL

Hold up.

WILL

Hey!

WILL

DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

WILL

DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!

CLARK

Yeah?

WILL

WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA

LIKE THEM APPLES?!!

DISSOLVE TO:

LAMBEAU

Excuse me. Is this the buildings and

grounds office?

TERRY

Yeah, can I help you?

LAMBEAU

I'm trying to find the name of a

student who works here.

TERRY

No students work for me.

LAMBEAU

Could you just check, because the

young man who works in my building--

TERRY

Which one's your building?

LAMBEAU

Building two.

TERRY

Well, if something was stolen, I

should know about it.

LAMBEAU

No, no. Nothing like that. I just

need his name.

TERRY

I can't give you his name unless you

have a complaint.

LAMBEAU

Please, I'm a professor here and

it's very important.

TERRY

Well, he didn't show up for work

today...

TERRY

Look, he got his job through his

P.O. so you can call him.

WILL

There is a lengthy legal precedent,

Your Honor, going back to 1789,

whereby a defendant may claim self-

defense against an agent of the

government where the act is shown to

be a defense against tyranny, a

defense of liberty--

JUDGE MALONE

Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who

signed the complaint isn't in my

courtroom. Why is that?

PROSECUTOR

He's in the hospital with a broken

knee, Your Honor. But I have

depositions from the other officers.

WILL

Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in

his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit

back in 1887, that "Every American

citizen is by birth, a sworn officer

of the state.  Every man is a

policeman." As for the other officers,

even William Congrave said; "he that

first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft

he that has stolen the treasure."

PROSECUTOR

Your Honor--

WILL

(to Prosecutor)

I am afforded the right to speak in

my own defense by our constitution,

Sir.  The same document which

guarantees my right to liberty.

"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,

is "the soul's right to breathe, and

when it cannot take a long breath

laws are girded too tight.  Without

liberty, man is a syncope."

(beat, to Judge)

Ibid. Your Honor.

PROSECUTOR

Man is a what?

WILL

Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though

he be wounded-- "Magna..."

JUDGE MALONE

Son,

(a beat)

My turn.

JUDGE MALONE

(reading)

June, '93, assault, Sept. '93

assault... Grand theft auto February

'94.

JUDGE MALONE

Where, apparently, you defended

yourself and had the case thrown out

by citing "free property rights of

horse and carriage" from 1798...

JUDGE MALONE

March, '94 public drunkenness, public

nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem.

November '94, assault. Jan. '95

impersonating a police officer,

mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--

JUDGE MALONE

You're in my courtroom, now and I am

aware of your priors.

(beat)

I'm also aware that you're an orphan.

You've been through several foster

homes. The state removed you from

three because of serious physical

abuse.

JUDGE MALONE

Another Judge might care. You hit a

cop, you go in.

(beat)

Motion to dismiss denied.

JUDGE MALONE

Keep workin' on your arguments, son.

A word of advice for trial; speak

English.

LAMBEAU

Excuse me, your Honor.

(offers hand)

Gerald Lambeau.

LAMBEAU

I'm a professor at M.I.T.

(beat)

Combunatorial Mathematics.

JUDGE MALONE

Oh. Pleased to meet you.

LAMBEAU

Do you have a minute?

CUT TO:

GUARD

One call, to an attorney.

(beat)

One.

WILL

How many?

WILL

Hey, Skylar?

SKYLAR

Yeah?

WILL

It's Will, the really funny good

looking guy you met at the bar?

SKYLAR

I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting

anyone who fits that description.

WILL

Okay, you got me. It's the ugly,

obnoxious, toothless loser who got

drunk and wouldn't leave you alone

all night.

SKYLAR

Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd

call.

WILL

Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this

week we could go to a cafe and have

some caramels.

SKYLAR

Sounds good, where are you now?

WILL

You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law?

Are you?

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

WILL

Fuck do you want?

LAMBEAU

I've spoken with the judge and he's

agreed to release you under my

supervision.

WILL

(suspicious)

Really?

LAMBEAU

(beat)

Yes. Under two conditions.

WILL

What're those?

LAMBEAU

That you meet with me twice a week

(a beat)

and you meet with a therapist.

WILL

If I agree to this, I walk right

now?

LAMBEAU

That's right.

WILL

I'll do the work. I'm not going to

meet with a therapist.

LAMBEAU

Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds,

Will.

(beat)

I've already spoken to one therapist,

his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a

friend of mine. He's also published

four books and is widely considered

to be one of the brightest men in

his field.

(beat)

I'm sure it'll be better than spending

the next six months in jail.

CUT TO:

BILLY

Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!

MORGAN

(being strangled)

Suck my cock!

BILLY

Oh, Morgan!

CHUCKIE

What'd you get? You get leniency?

WILL

Probation, counselin', few days a

week.

CHUCKIE

You're fuckin' good.

CHUCKIE

Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in

the Cobra Clutch.

MORGAN

(to Chuckie)

Fuck your mother too!

WILL

That's why I love stock-car racin'.

That Dale Ernhart's real good.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Now you know Will, and I know, what

you need to be doing. You have a

gift.

WILL

I could work the pit maybe, but I

could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

PSYCHOLOGIST

You have a quality -- something you

were born with, that you have no

control over -- and you are, in a

sense, hiding that by becoming a

janitor. And I'm not saying that's

wrong. I'm friends with the janitor

that works in my building.  He's

been to my house for dinner. As a

matter of fact I did some free

consultation for "Mike" -- that's

not his real name. That's in my book.

WILL

Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had

the same problems as "Chad" the

stockbroker.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Yes. The pressures you feel, and

again, I am neither labeling nor

judging them, are keeping you from

fulfilling your potential -- you're

in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery --

the Shenanigan's, Will.

WILL

You're right. I know.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Will, your not getting off that easy.

WILL

No, but, I mean you know... I do

other things. That no one knows about.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Like what, Will?

WILL

I go places, I interact.

PSYCHOLOGIST

What places?

WILL

Certain, clubs.

(beat)

Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

WILL

It's just that feeling when you can

take your shirt off and really dance.

(beat)

When the music owns you. Do you

understand?

PSYCHOLOGIST

I might understand that.

WILL

Do you find it hard to hide the fact

that you're gay?

PSYCHOLOGIST

What?

WILL

C'mon, I read your book. I talked to

you. It's just something I know to

be true.

PSYCHOLOGIST

That's very presumptuous.

WILL

Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready

to give me a jump.

PSYCHOLOGIST

(a little laugh)

Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

but I'm married and I have two

children.

WILL

I'm sure you do. You probably got a

real nice house, nice car -- your

book's a best seller.

PSYCHOLOGIST

You're getting defensive, Will.

WILL

Look, man. I don't care if you're

putting from the rough. There are

solid arguments that some of the

greatest people in history were gay;

Alexander the Great, Caesar,

Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon,

Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny

Terrio, not many straight men can

dance like that.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Who is "Danny Terrio?"

WILL

If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your

shot. Take some pride in it. You go

to church? So fuckin' what, God loves

you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well

known as you? By the time you put

your disguise on and skulk out of

the house Sunday nights you probably

look like "Inspector Clouseau."

PSYCHOLOGIST

Well, I can see this is pointless...

WILL

You're getting defensive... Henry.

And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at

least.  Christ, set her free.

WILL

Fuckin' hypocrite...

LAMBEAU

Henry?

PSYCHOLOGIST

No. You know what, Gerry? This is

why I don't do pro-bono anymore.

It's not worth it to me.

LAMBEAU

What happened?

PSYCHOLOGIST

I don't have the time. I'm going on

national television this week.

LAMBEAU

Wait a minute, Henry...

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

This rectangle is subdivided into

rectangles. One edge of an inner

rectangle is an integer. Can you

prove that one edge of the larger

rectangle is an integer?

WILL

Of course.

LAMBEAU

Okay. How?

WILL

It's an integer proof.

WILL

What? Hey, look buddy my time's almost

up. You want me to sit here for an

hour and write it out?

WILL

Look, I'll give you the key steps to

it but I'm not gonna do the whole

thing.

LAMBEAU

That would be a monumental waste of

time, wouldn't it, Will?

WILL

I think so.

LAMBEAU

I happen to know so.

LAMBEAU

You're thinking too hard. What if I

did this?

LAMBEAU

Now, what if I do this?

LAMBEAU

Have you ever played checkers?

WILL

You color-code it. Half-red, half-

black.  If that's an integer--

LAMBEAU

What's that?

WILL

Half-red, half-black--

LAMBEAU

--that?--

WILL

--Half-red, half-black--

LAMBEAU

--That edge!

WILL

An integer.

LAMBEAU

(checks his watch)

It would appear we got that proof in

under the wire after all. It's not

how hard you look at things, young

man, it's the way you look at them.

If you take aim before you fire, you

will find the most difficult problems

become, quite literally, child's

play.

LAMBEAU

Will, you've managed to offend four

of my colleagues so much that they

refused to come back. You're meeting

with the leading hypnotist in the

country next week and Tom and I plan

to sit in on the sessions, so I expect

you to behave appropriately.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Shall we start the, uh...

WILL

Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You

guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

HYPNOTIST

Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But

first, why don't you go to sleep for

me.

HYPNOTIST

Would you mind standing on one leg?

TIME CUT TO:

HYPNOTIST

Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now

how old are you?

WILL

Seven.

HYPNOTIST

And what do you see?

WILL

Somethin's in my room.

HYPNOTIST

What is it?

WILL

It's like a small figure, hoverin'

over me. Gettin' closer.

HYPNOTIST

You're in a safe place, Will.

WILL

It's touching me.

HYPNOTIST

Where is it touching you?

WILL

Down there.

(indicating genitals)

And I'm nervous.

HYPNOTIST

You don't have to be nervous, Will.

WILL

'Cause I'm not ready.

(calming)

But the figure tells me everything's

gonna be all right. 'Cause the

figure's a Libra too. And we start

dancin' and it's beautiful--

WILL

"SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"

LAMBEAU

(getting up)

Oh Jesus.

LAMBEAU

Wait a minute, Barry.

HYPNOTIST

I have better ways to spend my time.

LAMBEAU

Oh, for God's sake, Will.

WILL

Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this

one on me. He left, I wanted to talk

to him for another twenty minutes. I

was havin' fun.

LAMBEAU

I told you to cooperate with these

people.

WILL

C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece

of work.

WILL

(spooky voice)

Look into my eyes. I don't need

therapy.

LAMBEAU

Get out, Will.

WILL

Okay... don't forget to get another

therapist for next week.

LAMBEAU

That's enough.

TOM

I called Mel Weintraub this morning,

to check for availability.

LAMBEAU

What's the point?

TOM

What do you want to do?

LAMBEAU

There is somebody...

TOM

Who is he?

LAMBEAU

He was my roommate in college.

SEAN

Establishing trust is the most

important component in making

breakthroughs with a patient. Why?

SEAN

Maureen?

SEAN

Keep up the good work, Maureen.

Vinnie?

VINNIE

Because trust is an important thing.

SEAN

Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't

your brother give you the notes?

Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you

then they won't feel safe enough to

be honest with you -- then there's

no point to them being in therapy.

It's like saying -- "Fine, come here

and don't tell me a thing but go

home feeling like you're doing

something about your problems -- and

give me my fifty bucks before you

leave will ya'!"

SEAN

If you don't help them trust you --

then there's no way you'll ever get

them to sleep with you. And that

should be the goal of any good

therapist. Insecure women, you know...

nail 'em when they're vulnerable,

that's always been my motto.

SEAN

See, I got Vinnie's attention.

SEAN

Gerry.

LAMBEAU

Sean.

SEAN

(to class)

Well, it seems we're in the presence

of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau

is a Field's Medal winner.

Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.

LAMBEAU

Hello.

SEAN

The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize

for math.

(beat)

But it's only given out every four

years.

SEAN

Okay, that's all for today. Try and

get through Fernald by Monday.

LAMBEAU

Good to see you.

SEAN

Good to see you.

LAMBEAU

Is there someplace we can talk?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

I don't know, it was just kind of

the boring suburban thing. Private

school, Harvard, and now Med. School.

(Beat)

I actually figured out that at the

end of it, my brain will be worth a

quarter of a million dollars. I

shouldn't have told you that...

WILL

I bet your parents were happy to

pay.

SKYLAR

I was happy to pay. I inherited the

money.

WILL

Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

SKYLAR

Stanford. I'm leaving in June after

I graduate.

WILL

So you just want to use me and go?

SKYLAR

Well, I'm gonna experiment on you

for my anatomy class, then go.

WILL

In that case, fine.

(beat)

Want to see my magic trick?

SKYLAR

Sure.

WILL

Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels

disappear.

SKYLAR

Okay...

WILL

It works better when I have my rabbit.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

I didn't see you at the reunion.

SEAN

I've been busy.

LAMBEAU

You were missed.

(beat)

How long has it been since we've

seen each other?

SEAN

Since Nancy died.

LAMBEAU

I'm sorry, that damn conference--

SEAN

I got your card.

SKYLAR

Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

WILL

No.

SKYLAR

Well, there's this part of the movie

that's about how there's always this

tension on a first date where both

people are thinking about what's

going to happen with the whole 'good

night kiss' thing.

WILL

I really don't 'date' that much.

SKYLAR

(laughs)

You know what I mean. I know you've

at least thought about it.

WILL

No I haven't...

SKYLAR

Yes you have. You were thinking you

were gonna get a good night kiss.

WILL

(mock protest)

No I wasn't...

SKYLAR

Yes you were.

WILL

I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good

night laid" but... I'll take a kiss.

SKYLAR

Oh, you will?

WILL

No... I was hoping to get a kiss.

SKYLAR

Then why don't we just get it out of

the way.

WILL

Now?

SKYLAR

Yeah.

SKYLAR

That had to be the worst good night

kiss...

WILL

Hey, look lady, I'm just here for

the free food.

SKYLAR

Free?

WILL

Hey, I spent all my money on those

caramels.

CUT TO:

SEAN

I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full

schedule.

LAMBEAU

This kid's special, Sean. I've never

seen anything like him.

SEAN

Not much free time, Gerry.

LAMBEAU

Have you ever heard of a man named

Ramanujan?

SEAN

Yeah.

LAMBEAU

He was alive over a hundred years

ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not

feathers...

LAMBEAU

So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny

hut in India. No formal education,

no access to other works. But he

came across an old math book and

from this basic text he was able to

extrapolate theories that had baffled

mathematicians for years.

SEAN

And he mailed it to Hardy--

LAMBEAU

That's right, Sean. He mailed it to

a professor at Cambridge who

immediately recognized the brilliance

in his work and brought Ramanujan to

England.

SEAN

Where he contracted pneumonia and

died at a young age--

LAMBEAU

They worked together for the remainder

of their lives, producing some of

the most exciting math theory ever

done.  Ramanujan's genius was

unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like

that. But he's very defensive and I

need someone who can get through to

him.

SEAN

Why me?

LAMBEAU

I need someone with your kind of

background.

SEAN

My kind of background?

LAMBEAU

You're from the same neighborhood.

South Boston.

SEAN

He's from Southie? How many people

did you try before you came to me?

LAMBEAU

(looks squarely at

Sean)

Five.

SEAN

Who? Barry, Henry, Rick...

SEAN

Not Rick? You didn't send him to

Rick?

LAMBEAU

Just meet with the boy once a week.

SEAN

Can we do it at my office?

LAMBEAU

That would be fine.

LAMBEAU

Sean, please.

SEAN

I got it.

LAMBEAU

It's on the college.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Any vulnerability he senses, he'll

exploit.

SEAN

I'll be okay.

LAMBEAU

It's a poker game with this young

man.  Don't let him see what you've

got.

LAMBEAU

Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the

place?

WILL

No.

LAMBEAU

Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean,

Will Hunting.

LAMBEAU

Well, let's get started.

WILL

Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

SEAN

Would you excuse us?

LAMBEAU

Tom.

SEAN

You too, Gerry.

SEAN

Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.

SEAN

Where are you from in Southie?

WILL

Did you buy all these books retail,

or do you send away for like a "shrink

kit" that comes with all these volumes

included?

SEAN

Have you read all these books, Will?

WILL

Probably not.

SEAN

(indicating a shelf)

How about the ones on that shelf?

WILL

Yeah, I read those.

SEAN

What did you think?

WILL

I'm not here for a fuckin' book

report.  They're your books, why

don't you read 'em?

SEAN

I did.

WILL

That must have taken you a long time.

SEAN

Yeah, it did take me a long time.

WILL

(looking at book)

"A History of the United States,

Volume I." If you want to read a

real history book, read Howard Zinn's

"A People's History of the United

States." That book will knock you on

your ass.

SEAN

How about Noam Chomsky's

"Manufacturing Consent?"

WILL

You people baffle me. You spend all

this money on beautiful, fancy books--

and they're the wrong fuckin' books.

SEAN

You think so?

WILL

Whatever blows your hair back.

SEAN

(indicating cigarette)

Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.

Stunt your growth.

WILL

You're right. It really gets in the

way of my jazzercizing.

WILL

Do you lift?

SEAN

Yes, I do.

WILL

Nautilus?

SEAN

Free weights.

WILL

Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

SEAN

285.

WILL

Oh.

WILL

You paint this?

SEAN

Yeah. Do you paint?

WILL

No.

SEAN

Crayons?

WILL

This is a real piece of shit.

SEAN

Tell me what you really think.

WILL

Poor color composition, lousy use of

space. But that shit doesn't really

concern me.

SEAN

What does?

WILL

The color here, see how dark it is?

It's interesting.

SEAN

What is?

WILL

I think you're one step away from

cutting your ear off.

SEAN

Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?

WILL

You ever heard the saying, "any port

in a storm?"

SEAN

Sure, how 'bout "still waters run

deep"-

WILL

--Well, maybe that means you.

SEAN

Maybe what mea--

WILL

Maybe you were in the middle of a

storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the

waves were crashing over the bow,

the Goddamned mast was about to snap,

and you were crying for the harbor.

So you did what you had to do, to

get out.  Maybe you became a

psychologist.

SEAN

Maybe you should be a patient and

sit down.

WILL

Maybe you married the wrong woman.

SEAN

Watch your mouth.

WILL

That's it isn't it? You married the

wrong woman. She leave you? Was she

bangin' someone else?

WILL

How are the seas now, D--

SEAN

If you ever disrespect my wife

again... I will end you.

WILL

Time's up.

CUT TO:

WILL

At ease, gentlemen.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay?

LAMBEAU

I'll understand if you don't want to

meet with him again.

SEAN

Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure

the kid is here.

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

You grew up around here?

WILL

Not far from here, South Boston.

SKYLAR

How was that?

WILL

Pretty boring, I guess.

SKYLAR

I bet you have a great family.

WILL

You know, nothing special.

SKYLAR

You have a lot of brothers and

sisters?

WILL

Do I have a lot of brothers and

sisters?

SKYLAR

Yeah.

WILL

Well, Irish Catholic. What do you

think?

SKYLAR

How many?

WILL

You wouldn't believe me if I told

you.

SKYLAR

What, five?

SKYLAR

Seven?

SKYLAR

Come on.

WILL

I have twelve big brothers.

SKYLAR

Not a chance.

WILL

Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

SKYLAR

Bullshit.

WILL

I swear to God.

SKYLAR

Your house must have been a zoo.

WILL

It was great. There was always someone

to play with, give you advice.

SKYLAR

Do you know all their names?

WILL

'Course I do, they're my brothers.

SKYLAR

Well...

WILL

Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey,

Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby,

Johnny, and Brian.

SKYLAR

(laughing)

Do you keep in touch with them?

WILL

All the time. We all live in Southie.

I live with three of them now.

SKYLAR

I want to meet them.

WILL

We'll do that.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WILL

You again. How the paintin' coming?

SEAN

Come with me.

CUT TO:

WILL

So what's with this place? You have

a swan fetish? Is this something

you'd like to talk about?

SEAN

I was thinking about what you said

to me the other day, about my

painting. I stayed up half the night

thinking about it and then something

occurred to me and I fell into a

deep peaceful sleep and haven't

thought about you since. You know

what occurred to me?

WILL

No.

SEAN

You're just a boy. You don't have

the faintest idea what you're talking

about.

WILL

Why thank you.

SEAN

You've never been out of Boston.

WILL

No.

SEAN

So if I asked you about art you could

give me the skinny on every art book

ever written... Michelangelo? You

know a lot about him I bet. Life's

work, criticisms, political

aspirations. But you couldn't tell

me what it smells like in the Sistine

Chapel. You've never stood there and

looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

And if I asked you about women I'm

sure you could give me a syllabus of

your personal favorites, and maybe

you've been laid a few times too.

But you couldn't tell me how it feels

to wake up next to a woman and be

truly happy. If I asked you about

war you could refer me to a bevy of

fictional and non-fictional material,

but you've never been in one. You've

never held your best friend's head

in your lap and watched him draw his

last breath, looking to you for help.

And if I asked you about love I'd

get a sonnet, but you've never looked

at a woman and been truly vulnerable.

Known that someone could kill you

with a look. That someone could rescue

you from grief. That God had put an

angel on Earth just for you.  And

you wouldn't know how it felt to be

her angel. To have the love be there

for her forever. Through anything,

through cancer. You wouldn't know

about sleeping sitting up in a

hospital room for two months holding

her hand and not leaving because the

doctors could see in your eyes that

the term "visiting hours" didn't

apply to you. And you wouldn't know

about real loss, because that only

occurs when you lose something you

love more than yourself, and you've

never dared to love anything that

much. I look at you and I don't see

an intelligent confident man, I don't

see a peer, and I don't see my equal.

I see a boy. Nobody could possibly

understand you, right Will? Yet you

presume to know so much about me

because of a painting you saw.  You

must know everything about me.  You're

an orphan, right?

SEAN

Do you think I would presume to know

the first thing about who you are

because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I

don't buy the argument that you don't

want to be here, because I think you

like all the attention you're getting.

Personally, I don't care. There's

nothing you can tell me that I can't

read somewhere else.  Unless we talk

about your life. But you won't do

that. Maybe you're afraid of what

you might say.

SEAN

It's up to you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

Hello?

CHUCKIE

Who'd you call?

WILL

No one. I didn't have the number.

MORGAN

What are you, retarded? You went all

the way out there in the rain and

you didn't have the number?

WILL

No, it was your mother's 900 number.

I just ran out of quarters.

MORGAN

Why don't we get off mothers, I just

got off yours.

BILLY

You're a pretty funny guy. Here,

have a nickel.

MORGAN

Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what

happens.

BILLY

All right, then.

MORGAN

Watch what happens.

CUT TO:

SEAN

No smoking.

LAMBEAU

What do you mean "he didn't talk?"

You sat there for an hour?

SEAN

No, he just sat there and counted

the seconds until the session was

over. It was pretty impressive,

actually.

LAMBEAU

Why would he do that?

SEAN

To show me he doesn't have to talk

to me if he doesn't want to.

LAMBEAU

Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring

contest between two kids from the

"old neighborhood?"

SEAN

I won't talk first.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

KRYSTYN

Hi, Will.

WILL

How you doin', Krystyn.

CHUCKIE

I didn't get on Cathy last night.

WILL

Why not?

CHUCKIE

I don't know.

CHUCKIE

Cathy! Why didn't you give me none

of your twat last night?

CATHY

Fuck you and your Irish curse,

Chuckie!

CHUCKIE

She's missin' teeth, Will.

CHUCKIE

Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan

ends up marryin' her. There's only

so many times you can bang your

friend's future wife...

WILL

I'm takin' off.

ALL

We're goin' late night.

WILL

I'm tired.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WILL

You know, I was on this plane once.

And I'm sittin' there and the captain

comes on and is like "we'll be

cruising at 35,000 feet," and does

his thing, then he puts the mike

down but forgets to turn it off.

Then he says "man, all I want right

now is a blow-job and a cup of

coffee."  So the stewardess goes

runnin' up towards the cock-pit to

tell him the mike's still on, and

this guy in the back of the plane

goes "don't forget the coffee!"

SEAN

(smiles)

You've never been on a plane.

WILL

I know, but the joke's better if I

tell it in the first person.

WILL

I have been laid you know.

SEAN

Yeah? You got a lady now?

WILL

Yeah, I went on a date last week.

SEAN

How'd it go?

WILL

Fine.

SEAN

Well, are you going out again?

WILL

I don't know.

SEAN

Why not?

WILL

Haven't called her.

SEAN

Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.

WILL

I know what I'm doing. She's different

from the other girls I met. We have

a really good time. She's smart,

beautiful, fun...

SEAN

So Christ, call her up.

WILL

Why? So I can realize she's not so

smart. That she's boring. You don't

get it. Right now she's perfect, I

don't want to ruin that.

SEAN

And right now you're perfect too.

Maybe you don't want to ruin that.

SEAN

Well, I think that's a great

philosophy Will, that way you can go

through your entire life without

ever having to really know anybody.

SEAN

My wife used to turn the alarm clock

off in her sleep. I was late for

work all the time because in the

middle of the night she'd roll over

and turn the damn thing off.

Eventually I got a second clock and

put it under my side of the bed, but

it got to where she was gettin' to

that one too. She was afraid of the

dark, so the closet light was on all

night. Thing kept me up half the

night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep,

out of sheer exhaustion and not wake

up when I was supposed to cause she'd

have already gotten to my alarms.

SEAN

My wife's been dead two years, Will.

And when I think about her, those

are the things I think about most.

Little idiosyncrasies that only I

knew about.  Those made her my wife.

And she had the goods on me too.

Little things I do out of habit.

People call these things imperfections

Will. It's just who we are. And we

get to choose who we're going to let

into out weird little worlds. You're

not perfect. And let me save you the

suspense, this girl you met isn't

either. The question is, whether or

not you're perfect for each other.

You can know everything in the world,

but the only way you're findin' that

one out is by giving it a shot. You

sure won't get the answer from an

old fucker like me. And even if I

did know, I wouldn't tell you.

WILL

Why not? You told me every other

fuckin' thing. You talk more than

any shrink I ever met.

SEAN

I teach this shit, I didn't say I

knew how to do it.

WILL

You ever think about gettin'

remarried?

SEAN

My wife's dead.

WILL

Hence, the word remarried.

SEAN

My wife's dead.

WILL

Well I think that's a wonderful

philosophy, Sean. That way you can

go through the rest of your life

without having to really know anyone.

SEAN

Time's up.

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

Where have you been?

WILL

I'm sorry, I been real busy.

SKYLAR

You were busy? You know, I really

was waiting for you to call me.

WILL

Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another

crack at it. Let me take you out.

SKYLAR

You should have called. I have an "O-

chem" lab due tomorrow and it's

impossible.

(beat)

It's not an excuse dummy. I want to

go out with you. But look:

SKYLAR

Tomorrow?

WILL

Promise?

SKYLAR

If you bring the caramels.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WILL

I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

SKYLAR

How the hell did you do that?

WILL

Didn't your mother ever tell you not

to look a gift horse in the mouth?

SKYLAR

I'm supposed to understand this.

WILL

You're not going into surgery tomorrow

are you?

SKYLAR

No.

WILL

Then let's go have some fun.

SEAN

Really? How'd the date go?

WILL

Do you still counsel veterans?

(beat)

I read your book last night.

SEAN

No, I don't.

WILL

Why not?

SEAN

I gave that up when my wife got sick.

WILL

Is that why you didn't write anything

else?

SEAN

(smiles)

I didn't write anything else 'cause

nobody, including most of my

colleagues bothered to read the first

one.

WILL

Well, I've read you colleagues. Your

book was good, Sean.

(beat)

All those guys were in your platoon?

SEAN

Yeah.

WILL

What happened to that guy from

Kentucky?

SEAN

Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I

kind of lost touch with him after

Nancy got sick.

WILL

Do you ever wonder what your life

would be like if you never met your

wife?

SEAN

What? Do I wonder if I'd be better

off if I never met my wife?

SEAN

No, that's okay. It's an important

question. 'Cause you'll have your

bad times, which wake you up to the

good stuff you weren't paying

attention to.  And you can fail, as

long as you're trying hard. But

there's nothing worse than regret.

WILL

You don't regret meetin' your wife?

SEAN

Why? Because of the pain I feel now?

I have regrets Will, but I don't

regret a singel day I spent with

her.

WILL

When did you know she was the one?

SEAN

October 21, 1975. Game six of the

World Series. Biggest game in Red

Sox history, Me and my friends slept

out on the sidewalk all night to get

tickets. We were sitting in a bar

waiting for the game to start and in

walks this girl.  What a game that

was. Tie game in the bottom of the

tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk,

hit a long fly ball down the left

field line. Thirty-five thousand

fans on their feet, screamin' at the

ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin'

up the baseline, wavin' at the ball

like a madman. It hits the foul pole,

home run. Thirty-five thousand people

went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.

WILL

Where were you?

SEAN

I was havin' a drink with my future

wife.

WILL

You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to

have a drink with a woman you had

never met?

SEAN

That's right.

WILL

So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't

won a World Series since nineteen

eighteen, you slept out for tickets,

games gonna start in twenty minutes,

in walks a girl you never seen before,

and you give your ticket away?

SEAN

You should have seen this girl. She

lit up the room.

WILL

I don't care if Helen of Troy walked

into that bar! That's game six of

the World Series!

WILL

And what kind of friends are these?

They let you get away with that?

SEAN

I just slid my ticket across the

table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta

go see about a girl."

WILL

"I gotta go see about a girl"? What

did they say?

SEAN

They could see that I meant it.

WILL

You're kiddin' me.

SEAN

No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I

had gone to see that game I'd be in

here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a

bar twenty years ago. And how I always

regretted not goin' over there and

talkin' to her. I don't regret the

eighteen years we were married. I

don't regret givin' up counseling

for six years when she got sick. I

don't regret being by her side for

the last two years when things got

real bad. And I sure as Hell don't

regret missing that damn game.

WILL

Would have been nice to catch that

game though.

SEAN

(breaking)

Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was

gonna hit the home run.

--But what he's doing, he's attaching

an edge to the adjacent vertex. He

can always failsafe to either side--

PEKEC

Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

PEKEC

But I can always garbage out

(writes frantically)

All the way to "N" to the minus one.

LAMBEAU

No, there's a limit.

PEKEC

The limit is not found!

(turns to Will)

The limit is not found.

WILL

But I can always go to the other

side.

PEKEC

There is no proof--

LAMBEAU

Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is

three to the K times--

PEKEC

--But--

WILL

Look, I wrote it down.

WILL

It's just simpler this way.

LAMBEAU

Alexander, your theory is changed.

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

Why do we always stay here?

WILL

'Cause it's nicer than my place.

SKYLAR

I've never seen your place.

WILL

Exactly.

SKYLAR

What about your friends? Or your

brothers? When do I get to meet them?

WILL

They don't come over here that much.

SKYLAR

I think I can make it to South Boston.

WILL

Aah, it's kind of a hike.

SKYLAR

Is it me you're hiding from them or

the other way around?

WILL

All right, all right. We'll go.

SKYLAR

When?

WILL

Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

SKYLAR

What if I said I wouldn't sleep with

you again until you let me meet your

friends?

WILL

I'd say...

(reaches for phone)

It's only four in the mornin', they're

prob'ly up.

SKYLAR

You men are shameful. If you're not

thinking of your wiener then you're

acting on its behalf.

WILL

Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd

like to ask for an advance.

CUT TO:

MORGAN

Will, I can't believe you brought

Skylar here when we're all wrecked.

What's she gonna think about us?

WILL

Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity

that we'd be out drinkin'.

BILLY

I've been shit faced for like two

weeks.

MORGAN

Oh great, tell her that! Now she

really thinks we're problem drinkers!

CHUCKIE

Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle

Marty? Will knows him. That guy

fuckin' drinks like you've never

seen! One night he was drivin' back

to his house on I-93 -- Statie pulls

him over.

ALL

Oh shit.

CHUCKIE

Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but

he can't even fuckin' stand up, and

so my uncle's gonna spend a night in

jail.  Just then there's this fuckin'

BOOM like fifty yards down the road.

Some guy's car hit a tree.

MORGAN

Some other guy?

CHUCKIE

Yeah, he was probably drunker than

my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the

cop goes "Stay here" And he goes

runnin' down the highway to deal

with the other crash. So, my Uncle

Marty's standin' on the side of the

road for a little while, and he's so

fuckin' lit, that he forgets what

he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck

it." He gets in his car and drives

home.

MORGAN

Holy shit.

CHUCKIE

So in the morning, there's a knock

on the door it's the Statie. So my

Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?"

And the Statie's like "I pulled you

over and you took off."  And my

Uncle's like "I never seen you before

in my life, I been home all night

with my kids." And Statie's like

"Let me get in your garage!" So he's

like "All right, fine." He takes

around the garage and opens the door --

and the Statie's cruiser is in my

Uncle's garage.

ALL

No way! You're kiddin'!

CHUCKIE

No, he was so hammered that he drove

the police cruiser home. Fuckin'

lights and everything!

MORGAN

Did your Uncle get arrested?

CHUCKIE

The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed

he didn't do anything. The fuckin'

guy had been drivin' around in my

Uncle's car all night lookin' for

the house.

SKYLAR

There was this Irish guy, walking

down the beach one day.

SKYLAR

And he comes across a bottle, and

this Genie pops out. The genie turns

to the Irishman and says -- "You've

released me from my prison, so I'll

grant you three wishes." The Irish

guy thinks for a minute and says

"What I really want is a pint of

Guiness that never empties."  And --

POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it

down, and -- lo and behold -- it

fills back up again.

SKYLAR

Well, the Irish guy can't believe

it. He drinks it again, and again --

BOOM!  It fills back up. So, while

the Irish guy is marveling at his

good fortune, The Genie is getting

impatient, because it's hot and he

wants to get on with his freedom. He

says "Let's go, you have two more

wishes." The Irish guy slams his

drink again, it fills back up, he's

still amazed. The Genie can't take

it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm

boiling out here. What are your other

two wishes?"

(beat)

The Irish guy looks at his drink,

looks at the Genie and says... "I

guess I'll have two more of these."

CHUCKIE

It's a good thing no one's Irish

here.

MORGAN

I'm Irish.

CHUCKIE

I'm glad you came by, changed my

opinion of Harvard people.

SKYLAR

See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.

WILL

I don't know what the fuck you're

doin'.  You're givin' us a ride.

CHUCKIE

What do I look like, Al Cowlins?

(seriously)

You want to take my car, drop her

off?

WILL

I was countin' on it.

MORGAN

Chuck, let's go.

CHUCKIE

You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin'

the car.

WILL

Thanks, Chuck.

CHUCKIE

Don't get too slap-happy, you're

takin' me home first.

WILL

I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta

the way.

CHUCKIE

Just 'cause you don't have to sleep

in the one room palace, don't start

thinkin' you're bad.

SKYLAR

(to Will)

I thought you said you'd show me

your place.

WILL

Not tonight.

CHUCKIE

Yeah, not tonight. Not any other

night.

SKYLAR

I wanted to meet your brothers...

WILL

They're all sleepin' now.

(a beat, to Chuckie)

Let me get those keys.

CUT TO:

RECRUITER #1

What I want to know, Gerry, is when

we get to meet this wonder-boy.

LAMBEAU

We're still working together, the

boy's a little rough.

RECRUITER #2

We've got our share of eccentric

geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to

deal with that.

RECRUITER #3

I think we all do.

RECRUITER #1

If you're not exaggerating, Gerry--

LAMBEAU

Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty-

four when I told you I'd win the

Field's medal within two years?

RECRUITER #1

In that case the boy could run

shipping for us, routing--

RECRUITER #2

You say he doesn't have a diploma,

but we'll

RECRUITER #1

I don't need to see a driver's

license.  I can think of three

departments right now that he could

head up for us.

LAMBEAU

At ease, gentlemen. We're looking

carefully at all our options.

RECRUITER #3

All right, Gerry. Close to the vest.

(gives him his card)

Good luck with these vultures.

CUT TO:

SEAN

So she goes runnin' up the aisle and

I figure "fuck it" and I yell out

"don't forget the coffee!

MARTY

Bullshit! You didn't say that!

TIMMY

Jesus Christ, Marty. It's a joke.

SEAN

Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

LAMBEAU

Not at all.

SEAN

Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend

of mine. We went to college together.

TIMMY

Good to meet you.

LAMBEAU

Pleasure to meet you.

SEAN

Could we get a couple of sandwiches?

(beat, smiles)

Put it on my tab.

TIMMY

You ever plan on payin' your tab?

SEAN

(pulls out lottery

ticket)

I got the winning numbers right here.

TIMMY

What's the jackpot?

SEAN

Twelve million.

TIMMY

I don't think that'll cover it.

LAMBEAU

You're here quite a bit, then.

SEAN

I live right around the corner.

LAMBEAU

You moved?

SEAN

I been here a couple years.

SEAN

You wanted to talk about Will?

LAMBEAU

Seems like it's going well.

SEAN

I think so.

LAMBEAU

Well, have you talked to him at all

about his future?

SEAN

We haven't really gotten into it.

LAMBEAU

Maybe you should. My phone's been

ringing off the hook with job offers.

SEAN

Jobs doing what?

LAMBEAU

Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.

The kind of place where a mind like

Will's is given free reign.

SEAN

That's great, Gerry, that there's

interest -- But I'm not sure he's

ready for that.

LAMBEAU

Sean, I really don't think you

understand--

SEAN

What don't I understand?

SEAN

Thanks, Timmy.

LAMBEAU

Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?

We're trying to settle a bet.

TIMMY

Uh-oh.

LAMBEAU

Have you heard of Jonas Salk?

TIMMY

Yeah, cured polio.

LAMBEAU

You've heard of Albert Einstein?

LAMBEAU

How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard

of him?

TIMMY

No.

LAMBEAU

Okay thank you, Timmy.

TIMMY

So who won the bet?

LAMBEAU

I did.

LAMBEAU

This isn't about me. I'm nothing

compared to this young man.

(beat)

Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of

Professors who were renowned for

their study of the universe. But it

was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk,

doing physics in his spare time, who

changed the world, Sean. Can you

imagine if Einstein had given that

up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies

in Vienna every night? All of us

would have lost something. And I'm

quite sure Timmy never would have

heard of him.

SEAN

Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?

LAMBEAU

No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He

just hasn't got the direction. We

can give that to him.

SEAN

He married his cousin.

LAMBEAU

Who?

SEAN

Einstein. Had two marriages, both

trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his

kids, one of whom, I think, ended up

in an asylum- possible Unabomber

addition--

LAMBEAU

You see, Sean? That's exactly not

the point. No one remembers that.

They--

SEAN

I do.

LAMBEAU

Well, you're the only one.

LAMBEAU

This boy can make contributions to

the world. We can help him do that.

SEAN

Just... take it easy, Gerry.

LAMBEAU

Look, I don't know what else I can

say.  I'm not sitting at home every

night, twisting my mustache and

hatching a plan to ruin the boy's

life. But it's important to start

early. I was doing advanced

mathematics at eighteen and it still

took me twenty-three years to do

something worthy of a Field's medal.

SEAN

Maybe he doesn't care about that.

LAMBEAU

Sean, this is important. And it's

above personal rivalry--

SEAN

Now wait a minute, Gerry--

LAMBEAU

No, no you hear me out, Sean. This

young man is a true prodigy--

SEAN

Personal rivalry? I'm not getting

back at you.

LAMBEAU

Look, you took one road and I took

another. That's fine.

SEAN

Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think

it's fine with you. Give him time to

figure out what he wants.

LAMBEAU

That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It

worked wonders for you.

LAMBEAU

Sean, I came here today out of

courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in

the loop. As we speak the boy is in

a meeting I set up for him over at

Tri-tech.

CUT TO:

EXECUTIVE

(tentative)

Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure

what you mean, we've already offered

you a position..

CHUCKIE

Since this is obviously not my first

time in such altercations, let me

say this:

CHUCKIE

Look, we can do this the easy way or

the hard way.

CHUCKIE

At the current time I am looking at

a number of different fields from

which to disseminate which offer is

most pursuant aid to my benefit.

(a beat)

What do you want? What do I want?

What does anybody want? Leniency.

EXECUTIVE

I'm not sure--

CHUCKIE

--These circumstances are mitigated.

Right now. They're mitigated.

EXECUTIVE

Okay...

CHUCKIE

He knows what I'm talking about.

CHUCKIE

A retainer. Nobody in this town works

without a retainer. You think you

can find someone who does, you have

my blessin'. But I think we all know

that person isn't going to represent

you as well as I can.

EXECUTIVE

Will, our offer starts you at eighty-

four thousand a year, plus benefits.

CHUCKIE

Retainer...

EXECUTIVE

You want us to give you cash right

now?

CHUCKIE

Allegedly, what I am saying is your

situation will be concurrently

improved if I had two hundred sheets

in my pocket right now.

EXECUTIVE

I don't think I... Larry?

EXECUTIVE

I have about seventy-three...

EXECUTIVE

Will you take a check?

CHUCKIE

Come now... what do you think I am,

a juvenile? You don't got any money

on you right now. You think I'm gonna

take a check?

EXECUTIVE

It's fine, John, I can cover the

rest.

CHUCKIE

That's right, you know.

(turns to #1)

He knows.

CHUCKIE

(to exec #1)

You're suspect. I don't know what

your reputation is, but after the

shit you tried to pull today, you

can bet I'll be looking into it. Any

conversations you want to have with

me heretofore, you can have with my

attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears

to the grindstone.

CUT TO:

WILL

How's it goin'?

SKYLAR

Fine.

WILL

Want me to take a look?

SKYLAR

No.

WILL

C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go

to the battin' cages.

SKYLAR

It's important that I learn this.

WILL

Why is it important to you? If I

inherited all that money, the only

thing important to me would be workin'

on my swing.

SKYLAR

Clearly.

WILL

You're rich. What do you have to

worry about?

SKYLAR

Rich? I have an inheritance. It's

two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars.  That's exactly what it'll

cost me, minus about five hundred

bucks, to go all the way through med

school. This is what I'm doing with

that money. I could have done anything

I wanted. I could have expanded my

wardrobe, substantially.

WILL

Instead you're going to bust your

ass for five years so you can be

broke?

SKYLAR

No, so I can be a doctor.

SKYLAR

All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me

ask you a question? Do you have a

photographic memory?

WILL

I guess. I don't know. How do you

remember your phone number?

SKYLAR

Have you ever studied Organic

Chemistry?

WILL

Some, a little.

SKYLAR

Just for fun?

WILL

I guess so.

SKYLAR

Nobody does organic chemistry for

"fun."  It's unnecessary. Especially

for someone like you.

WILL

Like me?

SKYLAR

Yeah. Someone like you who divides

his time, fairly evenly, between the

batting cages and bars.

SKYLAR

How did you do that? I can't... I

mean even the smartest people I know,

and we do have a few at Harvard,

have to study- a lot. It's hard.

(beat)

Listen, Will, if you don't want to

tell me--

WILL

Do you play the piano?

SKYLAR

Come one Will. I just want to know.

WILL

I'm trying to explain it to you. So

you play the piano. When you look at

the keys, you see music, you see

Mozart.

SKYLAR

I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

WILL

Well all right, Beethoven. He looked

at a piano and saw music. The fuckin'

guy was deaf when he composed the

Ode to Joy. They had to turn him

around to take a bow because he

couldn't hear the crowd going crazy

behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all

of that music in his head.

SKYLAR

So, do you play the piano?

WILL

Not a lick. I look at a piano and I

see black and white keys, three pedals

and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart,

they looked at it and it just made

sense to them. They saw a piano and

they could play. I couldn't paint

you a picture, I probably can't hit

the ball out of Fenway Park and I

can't play the piano--

SKYLAR

But you can do my O-chem lab in under

an hour, you can--

WILL

When it came to stuff like that I

could always just play.

SKYLAR

I can't believe it's taken me four

years to meet you and I'm going to

California in two months, Will.

(beat)

Have you ever been to California? I

bet you'd like it.

SKYLAR

Maybe not.

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

Get it, ma!

CHUCKIE

(surprised)

Hey.

SKYLAR

Hi.

CHUCKIE

How you doin'?

SKYLAR

Good.

CHUCKIE

How'd you know where to find me?

SKYLAR

(smiles)

You were the only Sullivan in the

phone book.

SKYLAR

Will and I dropped you off here,

remember?

CHUCKIE

Oh, right.

SKYLAR

This is your house, right?

CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.)

Get in here, Chuckie!

CHUCKIE

(calling back)

Pipe down, Ma!

SKYLAR

I guess so.

CHUCKIE

What? No. This is my mother's house.

I don't live with my mother. I just

stop by, help out. I'm good like

that.

SKYLAR

Is this a bad time?

CHUCKIE

She'll live.

(beat)

If she starts yelling again I might

have to run in real quick and beat

her with the stick again but...

SKYLAR

Okay.

CHUCKIE

Let's take a walk.

SKYLAR

See, now this doesn't feel right.

(beat)

When I made the decision to come

over here it felt right. I had all

these rationalizations... I just

don't understand why Will never tells

me anything, he won't let me get

close to him, he tells me these weird

lies--

CHUCKIE

You caught that, huh?

SKYLAR

I just wanted to find out what was

going on... But now that I'm here it

seems strange, doesn't it?

CHUCKIE

Well, I don't have no trousers on...

CHUCKIE

I know why you're here. Will don't

talk much.

SKYLAR

I don't care what his family's like

or if he doesn't have any brothers,

but he doesn't have to lie to me.

CHUCKIE

I really don't know what to say.

Look, I lie to women all the time.

That's just my way.

(beat)

Last week Morgan brought these girls

down from Roslindale. I told them I

was a cosmonaut. They believed me.

But Will's not usually like that--

MAN ON PORCH

Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

CHUCKIE

Take it easy father!

CHUCKIE

All I can say is; I known Will a

long time -- And I seen him with

every girl he's ever been with. But

I've never seen him like this before,

ever with anyone, like how he is

with you.

SKYLAR

Is that true?

CHUCKIE

Yeah, it is.

CUT TO:

TOM

!!! !

WILL

!!! !

LAMBEAU

This is correct. I see you used

Mclullen here--

WILL

I don't know what it's called.

LAMBEAU

--This can't be right.

(examining proof)

This is going to be very embarrassing.

Have you ever considered--

WILL

I'm pretty sure it's right.

WILL

(turning back)

Can I ask you a favor, can we do

this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I

leave work to come here and the

fuckin' commute is killin' me--

LAMBEAU

That's fine, but did you ever think--

WILL

It's right.

(a beat, heading out)

Take it home with you.

LAMBEAU

Will, what happened at the Tri-tech

meeting?

WILL

I couldn't go 'cause I had a date.

So I sent my chief negotiator.

LAMBEAU

Will, on your own time, you can do

what you like. When I set up a

meeting, with my associates, and you

don't show up it reflects poorly on

me.

WILL

Then don't set up any more meetings.

LAMBEAU

I'll cancel every meeting right now.

I'll give you a job myself. I just

wanted you to see what was out there.

WILL

Maybe I don't want to spend my life

sittin' around and explaining shit

to people.

LAMBEAU

The least you can do is show me a

little appreciation.

WILL

(indicates proof)

You know how fuckin' easy this is to

me? This is a joke!

(crumples proof)

And I'm sorry you can't do this. I

really am. 'Cause if you could I

wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble

around and fuck it up.

LAMBEAU

Sure, then you'd have more time to

sit around and get drunk. Think of

how many fights you could have been

in by now.

LAMBEAU

You're right, Will. I can't do that

proof and you can. And when it comes

to this there are only twenty people

in the world that can tell the

difference between you and me. But

I'm one of them.

WILL

Well, I'm sorry.

LAMBEAU

So am I.

(beat)

Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I

wish I never met you. Because then I

could sleep at night. I wouldn't

have to walk around with the knowledge

that someone like you was out there.

And I wouldn't have to watch you

throw it all away.

CUT TO:

SKYLAR

Will? Are you awake?

WILL

No.

SKYLAR

Come with me to California.

WILL

What?

SKYLAR

I want you to come with me.

WILL

How do you know that?

SKYLAR

I know. I just do.

WILL

Yeah, but how do you know?

SKYLAR

I don't know. I just feel it.

WILL

And you're sure about that?

SKYLAR

Yeah, I'm sure.

WILL

'Cause that's a serious thing you're

sayin'. I mean, we might be in

California next week and you could

find out somethin' about me that you

don't like. And you might feel like

"hey this is a big mistake."

(getting upset)

But you can't take it back, 'cause

you know it's real serious and you

can't take somethin' like that back.

Now I'm in California, 'cause you

asked me to come. But you don't really

want me there. And I'm stuck in

California with someone who really

doesn't want me there and just wishes

they had a take-back.

SKYLAR

"Take-back?" What is that? I don't

want a take-back. I want you to come

to California with me.

WILL

I can't go out to California.

SKYLAR

Why not?

WILL

One, because I have a job here and

two because I live here--

SKYLAR

(beat)

Look, Will if you're not in love

with me, you can say that.

WILL

I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with

you.

SKYLAR

Then what are you afraid of?

WILL

What do you mean "What am I afraid

of?"

SKYLAR

Why won't you come with me? What are

you so scared of?

WILL

What am I scared of?

SKYLAR

Well, what aren't you scared of?

You live in your safe little world

where nobody challenges you and you're

scared shitless to do anything else--

WILL

Don't tell me about my world. You're

the one that's afraid. You just want

to have your little fling with the

guy from the other side of town and

marry--

SKYLAR

Is that what you think--

WILL

some prick from Stanford that your

parents will approve of. Then you'll

sit around with the rest of the upper

crust kids and talk about how you

went slummin' too.

SKYLAR

I inherited that money when I was

thirteen, when my father died.

WILL

At least you have a mother.

SKYLAR

Fuck you! You think I want this?

That money's a burden to me. Every

day I wake up and I wish I could

give that back.  I'd give everything

I have back to spend one more day

with my father. But that's life. And

I deal with it. So don't put that

shit on me. You're the one that's

afraid.

WILL

What the fuck am I afraid of?!

SKYLAR

You're afraid of me. You're afraid

that I won't love you back. And guess

what?  I'm afraid too. But at least

I have the balls to it give it a

shot. At least I'm honest with you.

WILL

I'm not honest?

SKYLAR

What about your twelve brothers?

WILL

Oh, is that what this is about? You

want to hear that I don't really

have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin'

orphan? Is that what you want to

hear?

SKYLAR

Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?

WILL

No, you don't want to hear that.

SKYLAR

Yes, I do, Will.

WILL

You don't want to hear that I got

cigarettes put out on me when I was

a little kid. That this isn't surgery.

WILL

You don't want to hear that. Don't

tell me you want to hear that shit!!

SKYLAR

Yes I do. Did you ever think that

maybe I could help you? That maybe

that's the point, that we're a team?

WILL

What, you want to come in here and

save me? Is that what you want to

do? Do I have a sign that says "save

me" on my back?

SKYLAR

I don't want to "save" you. I just

want to be with you. I love you. I

love you!

WILL

Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin'

bullshit me!

SKYLAR

(standing up to him)

You know what I want to hear?  I

want to hear that you don't love me.

If you tell me that, then I'll leave

you alone. I won't ask any questions

and I won't be in your life.

WILL

I don't love you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WILL

So why do you think I should work

for the National Security Agency?

DYTRESS

Well, you'd be working on the cutting

edge. You'd be exposed to the kind

of technology you couldn't see

anywhere else because we've classified

it. Super string theory, Chaos Math,

Advanced algorithms--

WILL

Codebreaking.

DYTRESS

That's one aspect of what we do.

WILL

Come on, that's what you do. You

handle more than eighty percent of

the intelligence workload. You're

seven times the size of the C.I.A.

DYTRESS

That's exactly right, Will. So the

question as I see it isn't "why should

you work for N.S.A." it's "why

shouldn't you?"

WILL

Why shouldn't I work for the National

Security Agency? That's a tough one.

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in

my mom's room again I'm gonna give

you a fuckin' beatin'!

MORGAN

(innocently)

What's up guys?

CHUCKIE

Why don't you beat off at your house?

MORGAN

I don't have a VCR at my house.

CUT TO:

WILL

I just wanted to call before you

left.

(beat)

I'm takin' all these job interviews.

So I won't just be a construction

worker.

SKYLAR

I never cared about that.

WILL

Yeah.

SKYLAR

I love you, Will.

(pause)

No take-backs.

SKYLAR

Will?

WILL

Take care.

SKYLAR

Goodbye.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

I can... I'm almost there.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

What are you smiling at?

WILL

It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

WILL

Pudge Fisk. You follow baseball?

LAMBEAU

No.

CUT TO:

WILL

Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean

told me. It's a long story.

WILL

You all set?

LAMBEAU

I've got the first part. The rest I

can do at home.

LAMBEAU

Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me

just about every hour. They're very

excited about how the meeting went.

WILL

Yeah.

CUT TO:

SEAN

So you might be working for Uncle

Sam.

WILL

I don't know.

SEAN

Gerry says the meeting went well.

WILL

I guess.

SEAN

What did you think?

WILL

What did I think?

WILL

Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody

puts a code on my desk, something

nobody else can break. So I take a

shot at it and maybe I break it. And

I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I

did my job well.  But maybe that

code was the location of some rebel

army in North Africa or the Middle

East. Once they have that location,

they bomb the village where the rebels

were hiding and fifteen hundred people

I never had a problem with get killed.

(rapid fire) Now the politicians are

sayin' "send in the Marines to secure

the area" 'cause they don't give a

shit. It won't be their kid over

there, gettin' shot. Just like it

wasn't them when their number got

called, 'cause they were pullin' a

tour in the National Guard. It'll be

some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel

in the ass.  And he comes home to

find that the plant he used to work

at got exported to the country he

just got back from. And the guy who

put the shrapnel in his ass got his

old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen

cents a day and no bathroom breaks.

Meanwhile my buddy from Southie

realizes the only reason he was over

there was so we could install a

government that would sell us oil at

a good price. And of course the oil

companies used the skirmish to scare

up oil prices so they could turn a

quick buck. A cute, little ancillary

benefit for them but it ain't helping

my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And

naturally they're takin' their sweet

time bringin' the oil back and maybe

even took the liberty of hiring an

alcoholic skipper who likes to drink

seven and sevens and play slalom

with the icebergs and it ain't too

long 'til he hits one, spills the

oil, and kills all the sea-life in

the North Atlantic. So my buddy's

out of work and he can't afford to

drive so he's got to walk to the job

interviews which sucks 'cause the

shrapnel in his ass is givin' him

chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile

he's starvin' 'cause every time he

tries to get a bite to eat the only

blue-plate special they're servin'

is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker

State.

WILL

So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out

for somethin' better. I figure I'll

eliminate the middle man. Why not

just shoot my buddy, take his job

and give it to his sworn enemy, hike

up gas prices, bomb a village, club

a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and

join the National Guard? Christ, I

could be elected President.

SEAN

Do you think you're alone?

WILL

What?

SEAN

Do you have a soul-mate?

WILL

Define that.

SEAN

Someone who challenges you in every

way.  Who takes you places, opens

things up for you. A soul-mate.

WILL

Yeah.

WILL

Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost,

O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--

SEAN

They're all dead.

WILL

Not to me, they're not.

SEAN

But you can't give back to them,

Will.

WILL

Not without a heater and some serious

smelling salts, no...

SEAN

That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll

never have that kind of relationship

in a world where you're afraid to

take the first step because all you're

seeing are the negative things that

might happen ten miles down the road.

WILL

Oh, what? You're going to take the

professor's side on this?

SEAN

Don't give me your line of shit.

WILL

I didn't want the job.

SEAN

It's not about that job. I'm not

saying you should work for the

government. But, you could do anything

you want. And there are people who

work their whole lives layin' brick

so their kids have a chance at the

kind of opportunity you have. What

do you want to do?

WILL

I didn't ask for this.

SEAN

Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.

That's a cop-out.

WILL

Why is it a cop-out? I don't see

anythin' wrong with layin' brick,

that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's

gonna get to work the next day 'cause

of me. There's honor in that.

SEAN

You're right, Will. Any man who takes

a forty minute train ride so those

college kids can come in in the

morning and their floors will be

clean and their trash cans will be

empty is an honorable man.

SEAN

And when they get drunk and puke in

the sink, they don't have to see it

the next morning because of you.

That's real work, Will. And there is

honor in that.  Which I'm sure is

why you took the job.

SEAN

I just want to know why you decided

to sneak around at night, writing on

chalkboards and lying about it.

(beat)

'Cause there's no honor in that.

SEAN

Something you want to say?

SEAN

Why don't you come back when you

have an answer for me.

WILL

What?

SEAN

If you won't answer my questions,

you're wasting my time.

WILL

What?

WILL

Fuck you!

WILL

Who the fuck are you to lecture me

about life? You fuckin' burnout!

Where's your "soul-mate?!"

WILL

Dead! She dies and you just cash in

your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-

out!

SEAN

I been there. I played my hand.

WILL

That's right. And you fuckin' lost!

And some people would have the sack

to lose a big hand like that and

still come back and ante up again!

SEAN

Look at me. What do you want to do?

SEAN

You and your bullshit. You got an

answer for everybody. But I asked

you a straight question and you can't

give me a straight answer. Because

you don't know.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting

in your office and the boy isn't

here.

(beat)

Well, it's ten past three.

(beat)

An hour and ten minutes late.

(beat)

Well, if he doesn't show up and I

have to file a report saying he wasn't

here and he goes back to jail, it

won't be on my conscience, Sean.

(beat)

Fine.

TOM

What should I do?

LAMBEAU

The boy was here. He came in, sat

down and we worked together.

LAMBEAU

He came in, sat down, and we worked

together.

TOM

Okay.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHUCKIE

How's the woman?

WILL

Gone.

CHUCKIE

What?

WILL

She went to Medical school in

California.

CHUCKIE

Sorry, brother.

(beat)

I don't know what to tell ya. You

know all the girls I been with. You

been with 'em too, except for Cheryl

McGovern which was a big mistake on

your part brother...

WILL

Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of

us has herpes.

CHUCKIE

Some shows are worth the price of

admission, partner.

CHUCKIE

My fuckin' back is killin' me.

SHEET METAL WORKER

That's why you should'a gone to

college.

WILL

Fuck you.

CHUCKIE

Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal

pussy.

(beat)

So, when are you done with those

meetin's?

WILL

Week after I'm twenty-one.

CHUCKIE

Are they hookin' you up with a job?

WILL

Yeah, sit in a room and do long

division for the next fifty years.

CHUCKIE

Yah, but it's better than this shit.

At least you'd make some nice bank.

WILL

Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.

CHUCKIE

It's a way outta here.

WILL

What do I want a way outta here for?

I want to live here the rest of my

life. I want to be your next door

neighbor. I want to take out kids to

little league together up Foley Field.

CHUCKIE

Look, you're my best friend, so don't

take this the wrong way, but in 20

years, if you're livin' next door to

me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'

Patriots' games and still workin'

construction, I'll fuckin' kill you.

And that's not a threat, that's a

fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

WILL

Chuckie, what are you talkin'...

CHUCKIE

Listen, you got somethin' that none

of us have.

WILL

Why is it always this? I owe it to

myself? What if I don't want to?

CHUCKIE

Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow

I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty

and I'll still be doin' this. And

that's all right 'cause I'm gonna

make a run at it.  But you, you're

sittin' on a winning lottery ticket

and you're too much of a pussy to

cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause

I'd do anything to have what you

got! And so would any of these guys.

It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if

you're still here in twenty years.

WILL

You don't know that.

CHUCKIE

Let me tell you what I do know. Every

day I come by to pick you up, and we

go out drinkin' or whatever and we

have a few laughs. But you know what

the best part of my day is? The ten

seconds before I knock on the door

'cause I let myself think I might

get there, and you'd be gone. I'd

knock on the door and you wouldn't

be there. You just left.

CHUCKIE

Now, I don't know much. But I know

that.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

This is a disaster! I brought you in

here to help me with this boy, not

to run him out--

SEAN

Now wait a minute--

LAMBEAU

--And confuse him--

SEAN

--Gerry--

LAMBEAU

And here I am for the second week in

a row with my professional reputation

at stake--

SEAN

Hold on!

LAMBEAU

Ready to falsify documents because

you've given him license to walk

away from this.

SEAN

I know what I'm doing and I know why

I'm here!

LAMBEAU

Look Sean, I don't care if you have

a rapport with the boy -- I don't

care if you have a few laughs --

even at my expense! But don't you

dare undermine what I'm trying to do

here.

SEAN

"Undermine?"

LAMBEAU

He has a gift and with that gift

comes responsibility. And you don't

understand that he's at a fragile

point--

SEAN

He is at a fragile point. He's got

problems--

LAMBEAU

What problems does he have, Sean,

that he is better off as a janitor

or in jail or hanging around with--

SEAN

Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

LAMBEAU

He can handle the work, he can handle

the pressure and he's obviously

handled you.

SEAN

Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?

Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because

the first thing that happened to him

was that he was abandoned by the

people who were supposed to love him

the most!

LAMBEAU

Oh, come on, Sean--

SEAN

And why does he hang out with his

friends? Because any one of those

kids would come in here and take a

bat to your head if he asked them

to. It's called loyalty!

LAMBEAU

Oh, that's nice--

SEAN

And who do you think he's handling?

He pushes people away before they

have a chance to leave him. And for

20 years he's been alone because of

that. And if you try to push him

into this, it's going to be the same

thing all over again. And I'm not

going to let that happen to him!

LAMBEAU

Now don't do that. Don't you do that!

Don't infect him with the idea that

it's okay to quit. That it's okay to

be a failure, because it's not okay!

If you're angry at me for being

successful, for being what you could

have been--

SEAN

--I'm not angry at you--

LAMBEAU

Yes you are, Sean. You resent me.

And I'm not going to apologize for

any success that I've had.

SEAN

--I don't have any anger at you--

LAMBEAU

Yes you do. You're angry at me for

doing what you could have done. Ask

yourself if you want Will to feel

that way for the rest of his life,

to feel like a failure.

SEAN

That's it. That's why I don't come

to the goddamn reunions!  Because I

can't stand the look in your eye

when you see me! You think I'm a

failure! I know who I am. I'm proud

of who I am. And all of you, you

think I'm some kind of pity case!

You with your sycophant students

following you around. And your Goddamn

Medal!

LAMBEAU

Is that what this is about, Sean?

The Field's Medal? Do you want me to

go home and get it for you? Then

will you let the boy--

SEAN

I don't want your trophy and I don't

give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew

you when!! You and Jack and Tom

Sanders. I knew you when you were

homesick and pimply-faced and didn't

know what side of the bed to piss

on!

LAMBEAU

That's right!  You were smarter than

us then and you're smarter than us

now! So don't blame me for how your

life turned out. It's not my fault.

SEAN

I don't blame you! It's not about

that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause

he's a good kid! And I won't see

this happen to him- won't see you

make him feel like a failure too!

LAMBEAU

He won't be a failure!

SEAN

If you push him into something, if

you ride him--

LAMBEAU

You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am

today because I was pushed. And

because I learned to push myself!

SEAN

He's not you!

WILL

I can come back.

LAMBEAU

No, that's fine, Will. I was just

leaving.

WILL

Well, I'm here.

(beat)

So, is that my problem? I'm afraid

of being abandoned? That was easy.

SEAN

Look, a lot of that stuff goes back

a long way. And it's between me and

him and it has nothing to do with

you.

WILL

Do you want to talk about it?

WILL

What's that?

SEAN

Oh, this is your file. I have to

send it back to the Judge with my

evaluation.

WILL

You're not going to fail me are you?

WILL

So what's it say?

SEAN

You want to read it?

WILL

No.

(beat)

Have you had any experience with

that?

SEAN

Twenty years of counseling you see a

lot of--

WILL

No, have you had any experience with

that?

SEAN

Yes.

WILL

(smiles)

It sure ain't good.

CUT BACK TO:

SEAN

(after a pause)

My dad used to make us walk down to

the park and collect the sticks he

was going to beat us with. Actually

the worst of the beatings were between

me and my brother. We would practice

on each other trying to find sticks

that would break.

WILL

He used to just put a belt, a stick

and a wrench on the kitchen table

and say "choose."

CUT BACK TO:

SEAN

Gotta go with the belt there...

WILL

I used to go with the wrench.

SEAN

The wrench, why?

WILL

Cause fuck him, that's why.

WILL

Is that why me and Skylar broke up?

SEAN

I didn't know you had. Do you want

to talk about that?

(beat)

I don't know a lot, Will. But let me

tell you one thing. All this history,

this shit...

(indicates file)

Look here, son.

SEAN

This is not your fault.

WILL

(nonchalant)

Oh, I know.

SEAN

It's not your fault.

WILL

(smiles)

I know.

SEAN

It's not your fault.

WILL

I know.

SEAN

It's not your fault.

WILL

(dead serious)

I know.

SEAN

It's not your fault.

WILL

Don't fuck with me.

SEAN

(comes around desk,

sits in front of

Will)

It's not your fault.

WILL

(tears start)

I know.

SEAN

It's not...

WILL

(crying hard)

I know, I know...

CUT TO:

SECURITY GUARD

Can I help you?

WILL

Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm

here about a position.

SECURITY GUARD

One moment.

DISSOLVE TO BLACK.

CHUCKIE

Oh my God, I got the most fucked up

thing I been meanin' to tell you.

MORGAN

Save it for your mother, funny guy.

We heard it before.

CHUCKIE

Oh, Morgan.

WILL

Sorry to miss this.

WILL

(to Chuckie)

You and Morgan throw?

CHUCKIE

No, I had to talk him down.

WILL

Why didn't you yoke him?

CHUCKIE

Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap,

dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid,

they never fight, everyone's scared

of 'em. You know how many people try

to whip Morgan's ass every week?

Fuckin' kid won't back down.

MORGAN

(from across the table)

What'd you say about me?

CHUCKIE

Shut the fuck up.

CHUCKIE

(To Will)

Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

MORGAN

You thought we forgot, didn't you? I

know I'm gettin' my licks in.

CHUCKIE

Shut up, Morgan.

(to Will)

Here's your present.

WILL

You're kiddin' me.

CHUCKIE

Yeah, I figured now that you got

your big job over in Cambridge, you

needed some way to get over there

and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you

every day...

CHUCKIE

Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

MORGAN

No I didn't...

CHUCKIE

But you're twenty-one now, so--

BILLY

Yeah, now that you can drink legally,

we thought the best thing to get you

was a car.

WILL

You're kiddin' me.

(a beat)

This is the ugliest fuckin' car I

ever seen in my life.

WILL

(serious)

How the fuck did you guys do this?

CHUCKIE

Me and Bill scraped together the

parts, worked on it. Morgan was out

panhandlin' every day.

MORGAN

Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose

fuckin' router you think sanded out

all that bondo?

CHUCKIE

Guy's been up my ass for two years

about a fuckin' job. I had to let

him help with the car.

WILL

So, you finally got a job Morgan?

MORGAN

Had one, now I'm fucked again.

WILL

(to Chuckie)

So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai

engine under there? Can I make it

back to my house?

CHUCKIE

Fuck you. I re-built the engine

myself.  That thing could make it to

Hawaii if you wanted it to.

CHUCKIE

Happy 21, Will.

CUT TO:

SEAN

Which one did you take, Will?

WILL

Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs

Professor Lambeau set me up with. I

haven't told him yet, but I talked

to my new boss over there and he

seemed like a nice guy.

SEAN

That's what you want?

WILL

Yeah, I think so.

SEAN

Good for you. Congratulations.

WILL

Thanks you.

(a beat)

So, that's it? We're done?

SEAN

We're done. You did your time. You're

a free man.

WILL

I just want you to know, Sean...

SEAN

You're Welcome, Will.

WILL

I'll keep in touch.

SEAN

I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I

don't know where I'll be.

SEAN

I just... figured it's time I put my

money back on the table, see what

kind of cards I get.

SEAN

I'll be checking in with my machine

at the college. If you ever need

anything, just call.

SEAN

Do what's in your heart, son. You'll

be fine.

WILL

Thanks you, Sean.

SEAN

No. Thank you.

WILL

(re: embrace)

Does this violate the patient/doctor

relationship?

SEAN

Only if you grab my ass.

WILL

See ya.

SEAN

Good luck.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

(surprised)

Will.

WILL

Hey, how you doin'?

LAMBEAU

You know, you're no longer required

to come here.

WILL

I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.

LAMBEAU

(a beat)

Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He

says you start working for them next

week.

LAMBEAU

Well, that's, I think that's terrific.

Congratulations.

WILL

Thank you.

LAMBEAU

I just want you to know... It's been

a pleasure.

WILL

Bullshit.

LAMBEAU

This job... Do it if it's what you

really want.

WILL

I appreciate that.

WILL

Hey, Gerry.

LAMBEAU

Yes.

WILL

Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you

need some help, or you get stuck

again, don't be afraid to give me a

call.

LAMBEAU

(has to smile)

Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

LAMBEAU

Hello, Sean.

SEAN

Come in.

LAMBEAU

Sean...

SEAN

(a beat)

Me too.

LAMBEAU

So I hear you're taking some time.

SEAN

Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd

travel some. Maybe write a little

bit.

LAMBEAU

Where're you going?

SEAN

I don't know. India maybe.

LAMBEAU

Why there?

SEAN

Never been.

LAMBEAU

Do you know when you'll be back?

SEAN

(picks up a flyer

from his desk)

I got this mailer the other day.

Class of Sixty-five is having this

event in six months.

LAMBEAU

I got one of those too.

SEAN

You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

LAMBEAU

Sean...

LAMBEAU

The drinks at those things are free.

SEAN

Hell, I know that.

LAMBEAU

How about one now?

SEAN

Sounds good.

SEAN

It's on you though, until eight

o'clock tonight when I win my money.

CUT TO:

LAMBEAU

Sean, do you have any idea what the

odds are against winning the lottery?

SEAN

I don't know... Gotta be at least

four to one.

LAMBEAU

About thirty million to one.

SEAN

You're pretty quick with those

numbers.  How about the odds of me

buying the first round?

LAMBEAU

About thirty million to one.

CUT TO:

WILL

(in writing)

Sean -- If the Professor calls about

that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I

had to go see about a girl."
