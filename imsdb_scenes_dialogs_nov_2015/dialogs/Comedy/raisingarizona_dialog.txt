Screenplay by

Ethan Coen

Joel Coen

OVER BLACK:

VOICE OVER

My name is H. I. McDunnough...

VOICE OVER

...Call me Hi.

VOICE OVER

...The first time I met Ed was in

the county lock-up in Tempe,

Arizona...

VOICE OVER

...a day I'll never forget.

SHERIFF

Don't forget the profile, Ed!

WOMAN

Turn to the right.

HI

What kind of name is Ed for a pretty

thing like you?

ED

Short for Edwinna. Turn to the right!

HI

You're a flower, you are. Just a

little desert flower.

HI

Lemme know how those come out.

VOICE OVER

I was in for writing hot checks which,

when businessmen do it, is called an

overdraft. I'm not complainin', mind

you; just sayin' there ain't no

pancake so thin it ain't got two

sides. Now prison life is very

structured - more than most people

care for...

VOICE OVER

...But there's a spirit of camaraderie

that exists between the men, like

you find only in combat maybe...

CON

Grrrr...

VOICE OVER

...or on a pro ball club in the heat

of a pennant drive.

VOICE OVER

In an effort to better ourselves we

were forced to meet with a counselor

who tried to help us figure out why

we were the way we were...

COUNSELOR

Why do you use the word "trapped"?

CON

Huh?

COUNSELOR

Why do you say you feel "trapped" in

a man's body?

CON

Oh...

CON

...Well, sometimes I get the menstrual

cramps real hard.

CHAIRMAN

Have you learned anything, Hi?

HI

Yessir, you bet.

WOMAN

You wouldn't lie to us, would you

Hi?

HI

No ma'am, hope to say.

CHAIRMAN

Okay then.

VOICE OVER

I tried to stand up and fly straight,

but it wasn't easy with that sumbitch

Reagan in the White House...

VOICE OVER

...I dunno, they say he's a decent

man, so...

VOICE OVER

...maybe his advisers are confused.

ED

Turn to the right!

HI

What's the matter, Ed?

ED

My fai-ants left me.

VOICE OVER

She said her fiancee had run off

with a student cosmetologist who

knew how to ply her feminine wiles.

HI

That sumbitch.

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Don't forget his phone call, Ed!

HI

You tell him I think he's a damn

fool, Ed. You tell him I said so -

H.I. McDunnough. And if he wants to

discuss it he knows where to find

me...

HI

...in the Maricopa County Maximum

Security Correctional Facility for

Men...

HI (O.S.)

...State Farm Road Number Thirty-

one; Tempe, Arizona...

HI

...I'll be waiting!

VOICE OVER

I can't say I was happy to be back

inside, but the flood of familiar

sights, sounds and faces almost made

it feel like a homecoming.

CON

Grrrr...

COUNSELOR

Most men your age, Hi, are getting

married and raising up a family.

They wouldn't accept prison as a

substitute.

COUNSELOR

...Would any of you men care to

comment?

GALE

But sometimes your career gotta come

before family.

EVELLE

Work is what's kept us happy.

ANGRY BLACK CON

Yeah, but Doc Schwartz is sayin' you

gotta accept responsibilities. I

mean I'm proud to say I got a

family... somewheres.

VOICE OVER

I tried to sort through what the Doc

had said, but prison ain't the easiest

place to think.

MOSES

An' when they was no meat we ate

fowl. An' when they was no fowl we

ate crawdad. An' when they was no

crawdad to be foun', we ate San'.

HI

You ate what?

MOSES

(nodding)

We ate San'.

HI

You ate sand?!

MOSES

Dass right...

CHAIRMAN

Well Boy, you done served your twenty

munce, and seeing as you never use

live ammo, we got no choice but to

return you to society.

SECOND MAN

These doors goan swing wide.

HI

I didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir.

SECOND MAN

Hi, we respect that.

CHAIRMAN

But you're just hurtin' yourself

with this rambunctious behavior.

HI

I know that, sir.

CHAIRMAN

Okay then.

VOICE OVER

Now I don't know how you come down

on the incarceration question...

VOICE OVER

...whether it's for rehabilitation

or revenge.

VOICE OVER

...But I was beginning to think...

VOICE OVER

...that revenge is the only argument

makes any sense.

ED

Turn to the right!

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Don't forget his latents, Ed!

HI (O.S.)

Hear about the paddy-wagon collided

with the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve

hardened criminals escaped.

HI (O.S.)

Got a new beau?

ED (O.S.)

No, Hi, I sure don't.

HI (O.S.)

Don't worry, I paid for it.

VOICE OVER

They say that absence makes the heart

grow fonder, and for once they may

be right.

HI

You missed a spot.

CON

Grrrr...

VOICE OVER

More and more my thoughts turned to

Ed, and I finally felt the pain of

imprisonment.

MOSES

An' momma would frow the live crawdad

in a pot of boiln' water. Well one

day I decided to make my own

crawdad...

VOICE OVER

...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin'

to put in the water, ya see...

VOICE OVER

...and it was like I was makin'

popcorn, ya see... The joint is a

lonely place after lock-up and fights

out...

VOICE OVER

...when the last of the cons has

been swept away by the sandman.

VOICE OVER

But I couldn't help thinking that a

brighter future lay ahead - a future

that was only eight to fourteen months

away.

CHAIRMAN

Got a name for people like you, Hi.

That name is called recidivism.

SECOND MAN

Ree-peat O-fender.

CHAIRMAN

Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?

HI

No Sir, it sure ain't. That's one

bonehead name. But that ain't me

anymore.

CHAIRMAN

You're not just tellin' us what we

wanna hear?

HI

No Sir, no way.

SECOND MAN

'Cause we just wanna hear the truth.

HI

Well then I guess I am tellin' you

what you wanna hear.

CHAIRMAN

Boy, didn't we just tell you not to

do that?

HI

Yessir.

CHAIRMAN

Okay then.

HI

I'm walkin' in here on my knees, Ed -

a free man proposin'.

HI

Howdy Kurt.

VOICE OVER

And so it was.

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Don't forget the boo-kay, Ed!

ED

I do.

HI

You bet I do.

MINISTER

Okay then.

VOICE OVER

Ed's pa staked us to a starter home

in suburban Tempe...

VOICE OVER

...and I got a job drilling holes in

sheet metal.

BUD

So we was doin' paramedical work in

affiliation with the state highway

system-not actually practicin',

y'understand - and me and Bill's

patrollin' down Nine Mile -

HI

Bill Roberts?

BUD

(barking)

No, not that motherscratcher! Bill

Parker! Anyway, we're approachin'

the wreck, and there's a spherical

object arestin' on the highway...

BUD

...And it don't look like a piece a

the car.

VOICE OVER

Mostways the job was a lot like

prison, except Ed was waitin' at the

end of every day...

VOICE OVER

...and a paycheck at the end of every

week.

CASHIER

Gummint do take a bite, don't she?

VOICE OVER

These were the happy days, the salad

days as they say...

VOICE OVER

...and Ed felt that having a critter

was the next logical step. It was

all she thought about.

VOICE OVER

...Her point was that there was too

much love and beauty for just the

two of us...

VOICE OVER

...and every day we kept a child out

of the world was a day he might later

regret having missed.

ED

That was beautiful.

VOICE OVER

So we worked at it on the days we

calculated most likely to be

fruitful...

VOICE OVER

...and we worked at it most other

days just to be sure.

VOICE OVER

Seemed like nothing could stand in

our way now...

VOICE OVER

...My lawless years were behind me;

our child rearin' years lay ahead.

HI

It's true I've had a checkered past,

but Ed here is an officer of the law

twice decorated...

HI

...So we figure it kind of evens

out.

VOICE OVER

...But biology and the prejudices of

others conspired to keep us childless.

VOICE OVER

Our love for each other was stronger

than ever...

VOICE OVER

...but I preminisced no return of

the salad days.

VOICE OVER

The pizazz had gone out of our lives.

VOICE OVER

Ed lost all interest in both criminal

justice and housekeeping. Soon after,

she tendered her badge.

VOICE OVER

Even my job seemed as dry and bitter

as a hot prairie wind.

BUD

So here comes Bill a-walkin' down

Nine Mile - that's Bill Parker,

y'understand - got his sandwich in

one hand, the fuckin' head in the

other...

VOICE OVER

I even caught myself drivin' by

convenience stores...

VOICE OVER

...that weren't on the way home.

VOICE OVER

Then one day the biggest news hit

the state since they built the Hoover

Dam...

VOICE OVER

...The Arizona quints was born.

VOICE OVER

By "Arizona" quints I mean they was

born to a woman named Florence

Arizona.

VOICE OVER

As you probably guessed, Florence

Arizona is the wife of Nathan Arizona.

And Nathan Arizona - well hell, you

know who he is...

NATHAN ARIZONA

(mixing up on the TV)

So come on down to Unpainted Arizona

for the finest selection in fixtures

and appointments for your bathroom,

bedroom, beaudoir!

VOICE OVER

...The owner of the largest chain of

unpainted furniture and bathroom

fixture outlets throughout the

Southwest.

NATHAN ARIZONA

And if you can find lower prices

anywhere my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

VOICE OVER

Yep, Florence had been taking

fertility pills, and she and Nathan

had hit the jackpot.

VOICE OVER

Now y'all who're without sin can

cast the first stone...

VOICE OVER

...but we thought it was unfair that

some should have so many while others

should have so few.

VOICE OVER

With the benefit of hindsight maybe

it wasn't such a hot idea...

VOICE OVER

...but at the time, Ed's little plan

seemed like the solution to all our

problems, and the answer to all our

prayers.

NATHAN

(into the phone)

Eight hundred leaf tables and no

chairs?! You can't sell leaf tables

and no chairs! Chairs, you got a

dinette set! No chairs, you got dick!

I ask my wife she got more sense!...

NATHAN

...Miles, all I know is I'm away

from the office to have me some kids

and everything goes straight to heck!

I ain't gonna stand for it!

VOICE OVER

...Yeah, and if a frog had wings he

wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I'm

sick of your excuses, Miles! It is

now...

VOICE OVER

...8:45 in the p.m. I'm gonna be

down to the store in exactly twelve

hours to kick me some butt!

VOICE OVER

...Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

NATHAN

That sounds like Larry.

HI

Shhhh! Shh! Nice baby...

NATHAN

What're they, playing telephone?

NATHAN

...Whyn't you go up and check on

'em?

ED

What's the matter?!

HI

Sorry honey, it just didn't work

out.

ED

What d'you mean it didn't work out?!

HI

They started cryin', then they were

all over me...

HI

...It was kinda horrifying - Lemme

in, honey.

ED

Course they cried! Babies cry!

HI

I know that now! Come on honey, we

better leave -

ED

You go right back up there and get

me a toddler! I need a baby, Hi;

they got more'n they can handle!

HI

Aw honey I -

ED

Don't you come back here without a

baby!

NATHAN

Christian Dior my butt...

NATHAN

...They pay money for that?

FLORENCE

Yes dear.

NATHAN

How're the kids?

FLORENCE

Fine dear.

NATHAN

Fuckin' kids, I love 'em.

ED

Which one ya get?

HI

I dunno. Nathan Jr., I think.

ED

Gimme here.

HI

Here's the instructions.

ED

Oh, he's beautiful!

HI

He's awful damn good. I think I got

the best one.

ED

I bet they were all beautiful. All

babies are beautiful!

HI

Yeah. This one's awful damn good

though.

ED

Don't you cuss around him.

HI

He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan

Jr.

ED

We are doin' the right thing, aren't

we Hi? - I mean, they had more'n

they could handle.

HI

Well now honey we been over this and

over this. There's what's right and

there's what's right, and never the

twain shall meet.

ED

But you don't think his momma'll be

upset? I mean overly?

HI

Well a course she'll be upset, sugar,

but she'll get over it. She's got

four little babies almost as good as

this one. It's like when I was robbin'

convenience stores -

ED

I love him so much!

HI

I know you do, honey.

ED

(still sobbing)

I love him so much!

HI (O.S.)

Okay, bring him in!

HI

This is it young Nathan Jr. Just

feast your eyes about, old boy!

ED

Don't be so loud around him, Hi.

HI

(softly)

Damn, I'm sorry honey.

ED

And don't you cuss around him.

HI

Aw, he don't know a cuss word from

shinola.

ED

Well see that he don't.

HI

(jovially)

He's all right, he is.

HI

...Come on over here, Nathan Jr.,

I'll show you around.

HI

...Lookahere, young sportsman. That -

there's the kitchen area where Ma

and Pa chow down. Over there's the

TV, two hours a day maximum, either

educational or football so's you

don't ruin your appreciation of the

finer things. This - here's the divan,

for sociahzin' and relaxin' with the

family unit. Yessir, many's the day

we sat there and said wouldn't it be

nice to have a youngster here to

share our thoughts and feelin's -

ED

He's tired, Hi.

HI

Well we'll just sit you right there,

boy...

HI

...Just put those dogs up'n take a

load off.

HI

What are you kiddin'?! We got a family

here!

HI

...He's a scandal, honey! He's a

little outlaw!

ED

He's a good boy.

HI

He ain't too good! You can tell by

that twinkle in his eye!

ED

Don't you think we should put him to

bed?

HI

Hang on, honey...

HI

...Let's us preserve the moment in

pictures!

ED

Just one, okay?...

ED

...I gotta tell ya, I'm a little

scared.

HI

How come is that, honey?

ED

Well we got a baby, Hi. It's an awful

big responsibility.

HI

Honey, could ya slide over a tad and

raise the nipper up?

ED

I mean we never done this before and

I'm kinda nervous.

HI

You're doin' real good, sugar.

ED

I love you, Hi.

HI

We're set to pop here, honey.

ED

You're gonna help, aren't ya?

HI

How's that, honey?

ED

Give Nathan Jr. a normal family

background, just quiet evenings at

home together...

HI

You can count on it, honey.

ED

...Everything decent'n normal from

here on out.

HI

Uh-huh.

EVELLE

...Okay.

GALE

What is it?

EVELLE

Mercury. Looks nice.

VOICE

Open up!

VOICE

...Open up in air!

VOICE

Open up! It's a police!

ED

Hi! What's goin' on?

VOICE

Po-lice, son! Open her up!

HI

Get in the bedroom.

ED

They ain't gonna take Nathan?!

HI

Well I'd like to see 'em fly.

VOICE

Open up and maybe we'll letcha plea-

bargain.

HI'S VOICE

...Honey! Come on out here! Want you

to meet a couple friends of mine!

HI

Honey, like you to meet Gale and

Evelle Snopes, fine a pair as ever

broke and entered.

HI

...Boys, this - here's my wife.

GALE

Ma'am.

EVELLE

Miz McDunnough.

ED

Kind of late for visitors, isn't it

Hi?

HI

Well yeah honey, but these boys tell

me they just got outta the joint.

Gotta show a little hospitality.

GALE

Well now H.I., looks like you been

up to the devil's bidnis!

EVELLE

That a him or a her?

ED

It's a little boy.

GALE

Got a name, does he?

HI

Well so far we just been using Junior.

ED

We call him Junior.

EVELLE

Say, thairs good - JR., just like on

the Teevee.

GALE

"Welcome... Home... Son." Where's he

been?

HI

Tulsa.

ED

Phoenix.

HI

He was, uh... he was visiting his

grandparents.

ED

They're separated.

GALE

Was that yer folks ma'am?

ED

No, I'm afraid not.

GALE

I thought yer folks was dead, H.I.?

HI

(very uncomfortably)

Well we thought Junior should see

their final resting place - Whyn't

you boys have a seat?

ED

Hi, it's two in the morning...

ED

...What's that smell?

GALE

We don't always smell like this, Miz

McDunnough. I was just explainin' to

yer better half here that when we

were tunneln' out we hit the main

sewer - dumb luck, that - and just

followed that to -

ED

You mean you busted out of jail!!

GALE

Waaaal...

EVELLE

We released ourselves on our own

recognizance.

GALE

What Evelle means to say is, we felt

the institution no longer had anything

to offer us.

GALE

...My Lord he's cute.

EVELLE

He's a little outlaw, you can see

that.

ED

Now listen, you folks can't stay

here!

EVELLE

...Ma'am?

ED

You just can't stay! I appreciate

your bein' friends of Hi and all,

but this is a decent family now...

ED

...I mean we got a toddler here!

GALE

Say, who wears the pants round here

H.I.?

HI

Now honey -

ED

Don't you honey me. Now you boys can

set a while and catch up, and then

you'll be on your way.

GALE

Gotcha on a awful short leash, don't

she H.I.?

ED

They still here?

HI

Yeah, they're just gonna stay a day

or two. It's raining out honey, they

got nowhere to go.

ED

They're fugitives, Hi...

ED

...How're we gonna start a new life

with them around?

HI

Well now honey you gotta have a little

charity. Ya know, in Arab lands they'd

set out a plate -

ED

Promise just a day or two.

HI

Tonight and tomorrow, tops.

VOICE OVER

That night I had a dream.

VOICE OVER

...I'd drifted off thinkin' about

happiness, birth, and new life...

VOICE OVER

But now I was haunted by a vision of -

VOICE OVER

He was horrible...

VOICE OVER

...a lone biker of the apocalypse...

VOICE OVER

...a man with all the powers of her

at his command.

VOICE OVER

...He could turn the day into night...

VOICE OVER

...and laid to waste everything in

his path.

VOICE OVER

He was especially hard on the little

things...

VOICE OVER

...the helpless and the gentle

creatures.

VOICE OVER

He left a scorched earth in his wake,

befouling even the sweet desert breeze

that whipped across his brow.

VOICE OVER

I didn't know where he came from or

why...

VOICE OVER

I didn't know if he was dream or

vision...

VOICE OVER

But I feared that I myself had

unleashed him...

VOICE OVER

...for he was The Fury That Would

Be...

VOICE OVER

...as soon as Florence Arizona found

her little Nathan gone.

CUT TO:

HI

(groggily)

He all right?

ED

He's all right. He was just havin' a

nightmare.

HI

Yeah, well...

HI

...Sometimes it's a hard world for

little things.

NATHAN

No, the missus and the rest of the

kids've left town to I ain't sayin'

where. They'll be back here when

we're a nuclear fam'ly again.

VOICE

Mr. Arizona, which tot was abducted?

NATHAN

Nathan Jr., I think.

VOICE

Do you have anything to say to the

kidnappers?

NATHAN

Yeah: Watch yer butt.

VOICE

Sir, it's been rumored that your son

was abducted by UFOS. Would you care

to comment?

NATHAN

(sadly)

Now don't print that, son. If his

mama reads that she's just gonna

lose all hope.

POLICEMAN

We really have to ask you some more

questions, sir...

NATHAN

But remember, it's still business as

usual at Unpainted Arizona, and if

you can find lower prices anywhere

my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!

POLICEMAN

Mr. Byrum here can take your exemplars

while you talk.

BYRUM

Just let your hand relax; I'll do

the work.

NATHAN

What is this?! I didn't steal the

damn kid!

POLICEMAN

Sir, these men are from the FBI-

NATHAN

(bewildered)

Are you boys crazy?! All I know is I

wake up this morning with my wife

screaming-

BYRUM

(patiently)

We just need to distinguish your

prints from the perpetrators', if

they left any.

NATHAN

Course! I know that!

FBI #1

Sir, we have an indication you were

born Nathan Huffhines; is this

correct?

NATHAN

Yeah, I changed m'name; what of it?

FBI #2

Could you give us an indication why?

NATHAN

Yeah, would you buy furniture at a

store called Unpainted Huffhines?

FBI #1

All right, I'll get to the point-

UNIFORMED COP

Was the child wearing anything when

he was abducted?

NATHAN

No one sleeps nekkid in this house,

boy! He was wear-

FBI #1

I'm asking the questions here,

officer.

COP

If we're gonna put out an APB we

need a description of the -

NATHAN

He was wearin' his-

FBI #2

It's just that we're better trained

to intervene in crisis situations

(to Nathan)

What was he wearing?

NATHAN

A dinner jacket! Wuddya think, he

was wearing his damn jammies!

FBI #2

(to cop)

The child was wearing his jammies.

Are you happy?

FBI #1

Do you have any disgruntled employees?

NATHAN

Hell, they're all disgruntled! I

ain't runnin' a damn daisy farm!

COP

What did the pajamas-

NATHAN

My motto is do it my way or watch

your butt!

COP

What did the pajamas-

FBI #1

So you think it might have been an

employee?

NATHAN

Don't make me laugh. Without my say-

so they don't piss with their pants

on fire.

COP

What did the pajamas look like?

FBI #1

(pained)

Officer-

NATHAN

(bellowing)

I dunno, they were jammies! They had

Yodas'n shit on 'em!

BELLOWING VOICE OFFSCREEN

Would ya mind, I'm trying to set up

a Command Post here!

NATHAN

Get your feet off m'damn coffee table!

FBI #1

Ron, you're upsetting the victim.

NATHAN

Damnit, are you boys gonna go chase

down your leads or are you gonna sit

drinkin' coffee in the one house in

the state where I know my boy ain't

at?!

FBI #2

Sir, there aren't any "leads" yet,

aside from this coat-

NATHAN

Gimme that!

NATHAN

That's a five-hundred-dollar camel's

hair-

BYRUM

Sir, you might want to wash your

hands at this point.

NATHAN

Well goddamnit!

NATHAN

...No leads?!

NATHAN

...Everyone leaves microbes'n whatnot!

NATHAN

...Hell, that's your forte, trackin'

down them microbes left by criminals'n

commies'n shit! That's yer whole

damn raison d'itre! No leads?! I

want Nathan Jr. back, or whichever

the hell one they took! He's out

there somewhere! Somethin' leads to

him! And anyone can find him knows

the difference between a lead and a

hole in the ground!!

EVELLE

...Awful good cereal flakes, Miz

McDunnough.

GALE

...Whyncha breast feed him? You 'pear

to be capable.

ED

Mind your own bidnis.

EVELLE

Ya don't breast feed him, he'll hate

you for it later. That's why we wound

up in prison.

GALE

Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz

tells us.

HI

Boys.

EVELLE

Morni', H.I.

ED

...Hi.

HI

Oh yeah... Say boys, you wouldn't

mind makin' yourself scarce for a

couple hours this afternoon?

ED

We're havin' some decent friends

over.

HI

Heh-heh... What Ed means to say is,

seein' as you two boys are wanted,

it wouldn't exactly do to have folks

seein' you here - I mean for your

own protection.

GALE

Sure H.I.

EVELLE

Anything you say.

HI

Matter of fact honey, maybe I'll

skip this little get-together myself,

Glen won't mind, and I'll just duck

out with the boys, knock back a couple

of-uh, Co-Colas-

GALE

Sure H.I.

EVELLE

We'd love to have ya.

HI

...Well... maybe that ain't such a

hot idea either.

GALE

(bitterly)

So many social engagements. So little

time.

HI

Glen, Dot-

DOT

Where's at baby? Where's he at?

GLEN

Go find him honey!

DOT

Cut it out, Glen!

ED

(quietly)

He's asleep right now.

GLEN

Shit, I hope we didn't wake it!

DOT

Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo?

GLEN

Come on kids...

GLEN

...Get away from Mr. McDunnough's

car.

DOT

What's his name?

ED

Uh... Hi Jr. Till we think of a better

one.

DOT

Whyncha call him Jason? I love

Biblical names. If I had another

little boy I'd name him Jason or

Caleb or- Oh!

DOT

...He's an angel!

DOT

...He's an angel straight from heaven!

Now honey I had all my kids the hard

way so you gotta tell me where you

got this angel. Did he fly straight

down from heaven?

ED

Well-

DOT

You gonna send him to Arizona State?

HI

Need a beer, Glen?

GLEN

Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

HI

...Well yeah, Glen, I guess it is

kinda funny.

GLEN

Say, that reminds me! How many

Pollacks it take to screw up a

lightbulb?

HI

I don't know Glen, one?

GLEN

Nope, it takes three!

GLEN

...Wait a minute, I told it wrong.

Here, I'm startin' over: How come it

takes three Pollacks to screw up a

lightbulb?

HI

I don't know, Glen.

GLEN

Cause they're so durn stupid!

GLEN

...Shit man, loosen up! Don't ya get

it?

HI

No Glen, I sure don't.

GLEN

Shit man, think about it! I guess

it's what they call a Way Homer.

HI

Why's that?

GLEN

Cause you only get it on the Way

Home.

HI

I'm already home, Glen.

KID

You wetchaself! Mr. McDunnough wet

hisseff, Daddy!

GLEN

Say, that reminds me! How'd you get

that kid s'darned fast? Me'n Dottie

went in to adopt on account of

something went wrong with m'semen,

and they told us five years' wait

for a healthy white baby! I said

healthy white baby! Five years! Okay,

what else you got? Said, two Koreans

and one Negro born with the heart

outside...

GLEN

...Yeah, it's a crazy world.

HI

Someone oughta sell tickets.

GLEN

Sure, I'd buy one.

GLEN

...That Buford's a sly one. Already

knows his ABCs. But I'm sayin', how'd

ya get the kid?

HI

Well this whole thing is just who

knows who and favoritism. Ed has a

friend at one of the agencies.

GLEN

Well maybe she can do something for

me'n Dot. See there's something wrong

with m'semen. Say, that reminds me!

What you gonna call him?

HI

Uh, Ed-Ed Jr.

GLEN

Thought you said he was a boy.

HI

Well, as in Edward. Just like that

name.

GLEN

(not really interested)

Yeah, it's a good one... Course I

don't really need another kid, but

Dottie says these-here are gettin'

too big to cuddle. Say, that reminds

me!

GLEN

Mind ya don't cutchaseff, Mordecai...

DOT

...and then there's diphtheria-

tetanus, what they call dip-tet. You

gotta get him dip-tet boosters yearly

or else he'll get lockjaw and night

vision. Then there's the smallpox

vaccine, chicken pox and measles,

and if your kid's like ours you gotta

take all those shots first to get

him to take 'em. Who's your

pediatrician, anyway?

ED

We ain't exactly fixed on one yet.

Have we Hi?

ED

...No, I guess we don't have one

yet.

DOT

Well you just gotta have one! You

just gotta have one this instant!

ED

Yeah, what if the baby gets sick,

honey?

DOT

Hi, even if he don't get sick he's

gotta have his dip-tet!

ED

He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey.

HI

...Uh-huh.

DOT

You started his bank accounts?

ED

Have we done that honey? We gotta do

that honey. What's that for, Dot?

DOT

That-there's for his orthodonture

and his college. You soak his thumb

in iodine you might get by without

the orthodonture, but it won't knock

any off the college.

DOT

...Reilly, take that diaper off your

head and put it back on your

sister!... Anyway, you probably got

the life insurance all squared away.

ED

You done that yet honey?

DOT

You gotta do that, Hi! Ed here's got

her hands full with that little angel!

HI

(dully)

Yes ma'am.

DOT

What would Ed and the angel do if a

truck came along and splattered your

brains all over the interstate? Where

would you be then?

ED

Yeah honey, what if you get run over?

DOT

Or you got carried off by a twister?

GLEN

Hear about the person of the Polish

persuasion he walks into a bar holdin'

a pile of shit in his hands, says

"Look what I almost stepped in."

HI

...Yeah, that's funny all right...

GLEN

Ya damn right it's funny! Shit man,

what's the matter?

HI

I dunno... maybe it's wife, kids,

family life... I mean are you, uh,

satisfied Glen?  Don't y'ever feel

suffocated? Like, like there's

somethin' big pressin' down...

GLEN

(solemnly)

Eeeeeyep... I do know the feelin'.

HI

Dunno-

GLEN

And I told Dottie to lose some weight

but she don't wanna listen!

GLEN

...No man, I know what you mean. You

got all kinds a responsibilities

now. You're married, ya got a kid,

looks like your whole life's set

down and where's the excitement?

HI

Yeah Glen, I guess that's it.

GLEN

Okay! That's the disease, but there

is a cure.

HI

Yeah?

GLEN

Sure; Doctor Glen is tellin' ya you

can heal thyself.

HI

What do I gotta do?

GLEN

Well you just gotta broaden your

mind a little bit. I mean say I asked

you, what do you think about Dot?

HI

(puzzled)

Fine woman you got there.

GLEN

Okay. Now it might not look like it,

but lemme tell you something: She's

a hellcat.

HI

That right?

GLEN

T-I-G-E-R.

HI

But what's that got to do with-

GLEN

Don't rush me!

GLEN

Now the thing about Dot is, she thinks-

and she's told me this-

GLEN

...she thinks... you're cute.

HI

...Yeah...?

GLEN

I'm crappin' you negative! And I

could say the same about Ed!

HI

What're you talkin' about, Glen?

GLEN

What'm I talkin' about?!  I'm talkin'

about sex, boy! What the hell're you

talkin' about?! You know, "L'amour"?!

I'm talkin' me'n Dot are Swingers!

As in "to Swing"! Wife-swappin'!

What they call nowadays Open Marriage!

GLEN

I'm talkin' about the Sex Revolution!

I'm talkin' about-

HI

Keep your goddamned hands off my

wife!

GLEN

Shit man!

GLEN

...I was only tryin' to help!

HI

Keep your goddamned hands off my

wife!

GLEN

You're crazy! I feel pity for you,

man!  You-

ED

We finally go out with some decent

people and you break his nose. That

ain't too funny, Hi.

HI

(stolidly)

His kids seemed to think it was funny.

ED

Well they're just kids, you're a

grown man with responsibilities.

Whatever possessed you?

HI

He was provokin' me when I popped

him.

ED

How'd he do that?

HI

...Never mind.

ED

But Hi, he's your foreman, he's just

gonna fire you now.

HI

I expect he will.

ED

And where does that leave me and

Nathan Jr.?

HI

With a man for a husband.

ED

That ain't no answer.

HI

Honey, that's the only answer.

HI

...Nathan needs some Huggies. I'll

be out directly.

HI

...Mind you stay strapped in.

HI

I'll be taking these Huggies and

whatever cash you got.

ED

"Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-

chin." Then I'll huff and I'll

puff...'

ED

"...and I'll blow your house in..."

ED

That son-of-a-bitch.

ED

You son-of-a-bitch!

HI

Better hurry it up. I'm in dutch

with the wife.

ED

That son-of-a-bitch. Hang on, pumpkin.

HI

Honey!

SPEAKER

Halt. It's a police warning, son.

Put those groceries down and turn

yourself in.

ED

That son of a bitch... Hold on,

Nathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

SPEAKER

That's private property, son. Come

back out to the street and reveal

yourself to Officer Steensma and

Officer Scott - that's me.

ED

That son of a bitch...

ED

...Lookie Nathan, a police car...

ED

...Say, that looks like Bill Steensma.

DRIVER

Son, you got a panty on your head.

HI

Just drive fast...

HI

...and don't stop till I tell ya.

HI

...Honey!

HI

Mind the baby now!

ED

Hold on Nathan, we'll take a shortcut.

SCREAMER

Can I stop now?

HI

Maybe you better.

HI

Thank you.

HI

Thank you honey, you really didn't

have to do this-

ED

You son-of-a-bitch! You're actin'

like a mad dog!

HI

Turn left, honey.

ED

What if me'n the baby'd been picked

up? Nathan Jr. would a been accessory

to armed robbery!

HI

Nawww honey, it ain't armed robbery

if the gun ain't loaded-

ED

What kind of home life is this for a

toddler?! You're supposed to be an

example!

HI

Now honey, I never postured myself

as the three-piece suit type - Turn

left, dear.

ED

We got a child now, everything's

changed!

HI

Well Nathan Jr. accepts me for what

I am and I think you better had,

too. You know, honey, I'm okay you're

okay? That - there's what it is.

ED

I know, but honey -

HI

See I come from a long line of

frontiersmen and - here it is, turn

here dear - frontiersmen and outdoor

types.

ED

I'm not gonna live this way, Hi. It

just ain't family life!

HI

Well... It ain't Ozzie and Harriet.

ED

You two are leaving.

ED

Tomorrow morning. Now I got nothing

against you personally...

ED

...but you're wanted by the

authorities and you're a bad influence

in this household, in my opinion.

GALE

Well ma'am... we sure didn't mean to

influence anyone.

EVELLE

And if we did, we apologize.

ED

I'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see

about some shots for the baby. When

I come back you better be gone or

I'll kick you out myself.

EVELLE

...What's he need, his dip-tet?

HI

I'm awful sorry boys, but when Ed

gets mad, you know, when she gets an

idea...

GALE

Well there ain't a thing to apologize

for, H.I...

GALE

...It seems pretty clear what the

situation is here.

EVELLE

Yeah, I guess the Missus wants us to

clear out.

GALE

Now H.I., you'll pardon me for sayin'

so, but I get the feelin' that this-

here...

GALE

...ain't exactly workin' out.

HI

Well now Ed's generally a real

sweetheart, I-

GALE

And as per usual, I wouldn't be

surprised if the source of the marital

friction was financial.

HI

Well, matter of fact, I did lose my

job today-

EVELLE

Come on Hi. you're young, you got

your health - what do you want with

a job?

GALE

But look, I'd rather light a candle

than curse your darkness. As you

know, Evelle'n I never go anywhere

without a reason... and here we are

in your little domicile. We come to

invite you in on a score.

EVELLE

A bank, Hi.

HI

Aw boys, I don't-

GALE

I know you're partial to convenience

stores but, H.I., the sun don't rise

and set on the corner grocery.

EVELLE

It's like Doc Schwartz says: You

gotta have a little ambition. Why we

just heard on the news how somebody

snatched off one of the Arizona

babies. Now there's someone thinkin'

big.

GALE

And here you are sittin' around on

your butt playin' house with a -

don't get me wrong, H.I., with a

fine woman - but a woman who needs

the button-down type.

HI

Well now that ain't really any of

your-

GALE

Just lookahere...

EVELLE

Picture of El Dorado, Hi.

GALE

Though the locals call it the Farmers

and Mechanics Bank of LaGrange. Looks

like a hayseed bank and, tell you

the truth, it is a hayseed bank.

Except the last Friday of every

financial quarter there's more cash

in that bank than flies at a barbecue.

EVELLE

And guess what day it is tomorrow?

GALE

Ya see, H.I., it's when the hayseeds

come in to cash their farm subsidy

checks.

EVELLE

A-One information.

GALE

Got it in the joint from a guy named

Lawrence Spivey, one of Dick Nixon's

undersecretaries of agriculture.

EVELLE

He's in for solicitin' sex from a

state trooper.

GALE

Ordinarily we don't associate with

that class of person, but...

GALE

...he was tryin' to make brownie

points with some of the boys.

HI

Boys, I can't -

EVIELLE

We need someone handy with a scatter-

gun to cover the hayseeds while we

get the cash.

GALE

Y'understand, H.I., if this works

out it's just the beginning of a

spree across the entire Southwest

proper. We keep goin' 'till we can

retire - or we get caught.

EVELLE

Either way we're fixed for life.

HI

Boys, it's a kind offer, but you're

suggesting I just up'n leave Ed. Now

that'd be pretty damn cowardly,

wouldn't it.

GALE

Would it?  Think about it, H.I. Seems

to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin'

her any good. And y'ain't bein' true

to your own nature.

VOICE OVER

My dearest Edwinna. Tonight as you

and Nathan slumber, my heart is filled

with anguish.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...I hope that you will both

understand, and forgive me for what

I have decided I must do. By the

time you read this, I will be gone.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...I will never be the man that you

want me to be, the husband and father

that you and Nathan deserve...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

Maybe it's my upbringing; maybe it's

just that my genes got screwed up -

I don't know...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

But the events of the last day have

showed, amply, that I don't have the

strength of character to raise up a

family...

VOICE OVER

...in the manner befitting a

responsible adult, and not like the

wild man from Borneo.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...I say all this to my shame.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...I will love you always, truly and

deeply. But I fear that if I stay I

would only bring bad trouble...

VOICE OVER

...on the heads of you and Nathan

Jr.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

I feel the thunder gathering even

now; if I leave, hopefully, it will

leave with me.

VOICE OVER

I cannot tarry...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

Better I should go, send you money,

and let you curse my name. Your

loving... Herbert.

FADE OUT

SECRETARY'S VOICE

I'm sorry, Mr. Arizona, he just barged

in...

SECRETARY'S VOICE

...Should I call Dewayne?

NATHAN

Hell no, why wake the security guard.

I'll take care a this.

BIKER

You got flies.

NATHAN

I doubt it. This place's climate-

controlled, all the windows are

sealed. Who the hell are you?

BIKER

Name of Leonard Smalls. My friends

call me Lenny...

BIKER

...Only I ain't got no friends.

NATHAN

Stop, you'll make me bust out crying.

Listen Leonard, you want some

furniture or a shitbox, they're out

on the sales floor.

SMALLS

Nooo, I ain't a customer, I'm a

manhunter. Ordinarily. Though I do

hunt babies, on occasion. Hear you

got one you can't put your hand to.

NATHAN

What do you know about it?

SMALLS

Wal, that's my business. I'm a tracker-

part Hopi Indian, some say part hound

dog. When some dink skips bail,

crashes outta the joint, I'm the man

they call.

NATHAN

Mister, I got the cops, the state

troopers and the Federal-B-I already

lookin' for my boy. Now if you got

information I strongly advise-

SMALLS

Cop won't find your boy. Cop couldn't

find his own butt if it had a bell

on it. Wanna find an outlaw, call an

outlaw. Wanna find a Dunkin Donuts,

call a cop.

NATHAN

Smalls, first off, take your damn

feet off m'furniture. Second off,

it's widely known I posted a twenty

grand reward for my boy. If you can

find him, claim it. Short of that

what do we got to talk about?

SMALLS

Price. Fair price. And that ain't

whatever you say it is; fair price

is what the market'll bear. Now there

are people, mind you, there are people

in this land, who'll pay a lot more'n

twenty grand for a healthy baby.

NATHAN

What're you after?

SMALLS

Give you an idea, when I was a lad I

m'self fetched twenty-five thousand

on the black market. And them's 1954

dollars. I'm sayin, fair price. For

fifty grand I'll track him, find him-

SMALLS

...and the people that took him...

SMALLS

...I'll kick their butts.

SMALLS

...No extra charge.

NATHAN

And if I don't pay?

SMALLS

Oh I'll get your boy regardless.

Cause if you don't pay, the market

will.

NATHAN

You wanna know what I think? I think

you're an evil man. I think this is

nothin' but a goddamn screw job. I

think it's a shakedown. I think you're

the one took Nathan Jr. and my fine

friend, I think you're the one gonna

get his butt kicked...

NATHAN

I think I'm on the phone to the cops

right now, and I-

GALE (O.S.)

Up and attem, H.I. Today is the first

day of the rest of your life...

EVELLE (O.S.)

...and already you're fuckin' it up.

EVELLE

Come on, the missus'll be back from

town soon.

HI

Where's the baby?

EVELLE

Bedroom, in his crib.

GALE

He's sawin' toothpicks, he'll be

fine.

GALE

...You expectin' anybody?

HI

No. You two stay outta sight.

HI

Shit.

HI

Morning Glen.

GLEN

I ain't comin' in if ya don't mind.

I'll just keep my distance.

HI

I didn't invite you in, Glen.

GLEN

Well don't even bother. First off,

you're fired - and that's official.

HI

I kinda figured that, Glen.

GLEN

Well that ain't why I'm here neither.

No sir. You're in a whole shitload

of trouble, my friend.

HI

Why don't you just calm down, Glen.

GLEN

Why don't you make me?! Know that

little baby you got in there? Remember

him? I know what his real name is!

HI

Wanna keep your voice down, Glen?

GLEN

I'll pitch my voice wherever I please!

His name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't

Ed Jr.! But it's junior an right!

Yes sir, it's Nathan Jr.!

GLEN

...Stay away from me, McDunnough!

GLEN

...Sure, you're an awful big man

when you got somethin' around to

clobber a guy with!

HI

(softly)

I ain't a big man.

GLEN

That's right! And now you're at my

mercy!

GLEN

...I'm your worst nightmare!  I wanted

to just turn you in for the re-ward.

But Dot, she wants something to

cuddle. So it looks like that baby's

gonna be Glen Jr. From now on!

GLEN

...I'll give you a day to break the

news to Ed...

GLEN

...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him

up.

GLEN

...It's either that or jail. Oh and

say, that reminds me! You'll find a

doctor bill in the mail in a few

days. I recommend you pay it!

HI

What's goin' on here.

GALE

You know what's goin' on, H.I. It's

just business. Now this can go either

hard or easy-

ED

...Good.

QUICK FADE OUT

HI

(frantically)

I know you're worried honey but

believe me, there ain't a thing to

worry about. We're gonna get him

back, there just ain't no question

about that...

HI

...We'll get him back, that's just

all there is to it. And you wanna

know another thing?

HI

...I'm gonna be a better person from

here on out. And that's final, I

mean that's absolutely the way it's

gonna be, that's official. You were

right and I was wrong...

HI

...A blind man could tell you that.

Now they ain't gonna hurt him, they're

just in it for the score...

HI

...But I ain't like that no more,

I'm a changed man. You were right

and I was wrong. We got a family

here and I'm gonna start acting

responsibly...

HI

...So let's go honey...

HI

...Let's go get Nathan Jr.

GALE

I luuuuv to drive.

EVELLE

You said somethin' there, partner.

GALE

...Yessir, I figure with the ransom

and this bank, you'n I'll be sittin'

in the fabled catbird seat.

EVELLE

Uh, Gale... Junior had a, uh,

accident.

GALE

What's that, pardner?

EVELLE

He had a little accident.

GALE

Wuddya mean, he looks okay.

EVELLE

No, ya see... Movin' though we are,

he just had hisself a rest stop.

GALE

Well it's perfectly natural.

EVELLE

(very excited)

Hey Gale!

GALE

What now?

EVELLE

...He smiled at me!

EVELLE (O.S.)

Know how you put these thangs on?

CASHIER

Welp. Around the butt, then up over

the groin area-

EVELLE

I know where they go, old timer. I

mean do I need pins or fasteners?

CASHIER

Well no, they got those tape-ettes

already on there, it's self-contained

and fairly explanatory.

EVELLE

Uh-huh...

EVELLE

...These blow up into funny shapes

at all?

CASHIER

Well no. Unless round is funny.

EVELLE

All right, I'll take these too. Now

you lie down back there-

CASHIER

Yessir!

EVELLE

And don't you move till you've counted

up to eight hundred and twenty-five

and then backwards down to zero.

I'll be back to check - see y'ain't

cheatin'.

CASHIER (O.S.)

You the diaper burglar?

EVELLE

Looks like I'm one of 'em.

EVELLE

Get the door, will ya?

GALE

He's a real cheerful little critter

once he warms up to ya.

EVELLE

Hurry up Gale...

EVELLE

I don't know how high this one can

count.

EVELLE

I got him some baby grub... baby

wipes... diapers, disposable... packet

of balloons-

GALE

They blow up into funny shapes at

all?

EVELLE

No, just-

GALE

Say, where's Junior?

EVELLE

Wuddya mean, didn't you put him in?!

GALE

No, I thought-

GALE

Where'd we leave him?!

EVELLE

NOOOOOO!!

CASHIER

...Seven hunnert ninety-seven one

thousand, seven hunnert ninety-six

one thousand...

CASHIER

...Seven hunnert ninety-one one

thousand, seven hunnert - ah...

bullshit.

CASHIER

Seven hunnert ninety - ought one

thousand! Seven hundred eighty -

EVELLE

Promise we ain't never gonna give

him up, Gale! We ain't never gonna

let him go!

GALE

We'll never give him up, Evelle.

He's our little Gale Jr. now.

HI

...Ed, I realize I can't be much of

a comfort to you. But lemme just say

this...

HI

You'll feel a whole lot better when-

ED

I don't wanna feel better.

HI

Honey-

ED

I don't care about myself anymore. I

don't care about us anymore. I just

want Nathan Junior back safe.

HI

I know that-

ED

If we don't get him back safe, I

don't wanna go on livin'. And even

if we do, I don't wanna go on livin'

with you.

ED

...I guess I still love you Hi; I

know I do. I ain't even blaming you.

The whole thing was crazy and the

whole thing was my idea.

HI

Well, factually, I myself bear a

very large-

ED

Lemme finish. Since those jailbirds

took little Nathan I been doin' some

thinking, and I ain't too proud of

myself. Even if Mrs. Arizona had

more'n she could handle, I was a

police officer sworn to uphold the

Constitution of the United States -

HI

Now waitaminute honey, you resigned

before we-

ED

That ain't the point, Hi. We don't

deserve Nathan Jr. Any more'n those

jailbirds do. And if I'm as selfish

and irresponsible as you-

HI

Y'ain't that bad, honey.

ED

If I'm as bad as you, what good're

we to each other. You'n me's just a

fool's paradise.

EVELLE

There she is.

GALE

Yep. Welp...

GALE

...Let's do her.

EVELLE

Waitaminute. What do we do with Gale

Jr.?

GALE

Wuddya mean, he waits here.

EVELLE

Are you crazy?!  He can't wait here

by hisself. Supposin' we get killed

in there - it could be hours before

he's discovered.

GALE

All right you hayseeds, it's a stick-

up! Everbody freeze! Everbody down

on the ground!

HAYSEED

Well which is it young fella? You

want I should freeze or get down on

the ground? Mean to say, iffen I

freeze, I can't rightly drop. And

iffen I drop, I'm a gonna be in

motion. Ya see -

GALE

SHUTUP!

HAYSEED

Yessir.

GALE

Everone down on the ground!

EVELLE

Y'all can just forget that part about

freezin'.

GALE

That is until they get down there.

EVELLE

Y'all hear that?

GALE

Wanna fill that sack, pardner? We

got - shit!

GALE

...Where'd all the tellers go?

VOICE

We're down here, sir.

EVELLE

They're down on the ground like you

commanded, Gale.

GALE

I told you not to use m'damn name!

Can't you even try to keep from

forget'n that?!

EVELLE

Not even yer code name?

GALE

Oh yeah... m'code name.

EVELLE

Y'all hear that?

GALE

All right now everone, we're just

about ready to begin the robbery

proper...

EVELLE

All right now everyone, you know how

this works: Y'all stay flattened for

ten full minutes...

EVELLE

...We might come back in five to

check. That's for us to know and y'a

to find out.

GALE

Anyone found bipedal in five wears

his ass for a hat.

GALE

That old timer threw off my

concentration. Otherwise it would a

gone smoother.

EVELLE

We done okay. Yessir. This ought to

split nicely three ways.

GALE

Goddamnit! Ya never leave a man

behind!

GALE

Goddamnit H.I., ain't we got enough

to contend with?

ED

Where's the baby?

EVELLE

I think we left him on the roof of

the... he must be back at the...

GALE

Let us come with you!

GALE

...He's our baby too!

ED

What is he?

HI

...D'you see him too?

ED

I want that baby!

ED

Gimme that baby, you warthog from

hell!

OLD TIMER

Just lie down on the floor, missie.

HI

Run along now, honey.

FADE OUT

NATHAN

The hell is goin' on?

NATHAN

...Get away from there.

NATHAN

(sharply)

Waitaminute...

NATHAN

...I ain't through with you. What're

you doin' creepin' around here in

the dark? You in with Smalls?

HI

...Scuse me?

NATHAN

Leonard Smalls, big fella rides a

Harley, dresses like a rock star?

HI

No sir, that's who we saved him from.

It's a long story.

NATHAN

Suppose you tell it.

HI

Well, sir, in a re-ward situation,

they usually say no questions asked.

NATHAN

Do they.

NATHAN

...All right, boy, I guess you got a

re-ward coming. Twenty thousand

dollars...

NATHAN

...Or, if you need home furnishings,

I can give you a fine of credit at

any of my stores. Fact, that's the

way I'd rather handle it, for tax

reasons...

HI

Well-

NATHAN

But it's up to you.

HI

Tell you the truth, I think we'd

prefer the ca-

ED

We don't want no reward.

ED

...We didn't bring him back for money.

NATHAN

Well, we could work it that way too.

ED

Could I just look at him a little

bit more?

NATHAN

Be my guest, young lady... but would

you mind tellin' me exactly how you-

NATHAN

...You took him, didn't you? Wasn't

that biker a'tal.

HI

I took him, sir, my wife had nothin'

to do with it. I crept in yon window

and-

ED

(still crying)

We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt

him any; I just wanted to be a mama.

HI

It wasn't for money or nothin'. We

just figured you had more'n you could

handle, babywise. But I'm the one

committed the actual crime sir, if

you need to call the authorities-

NATHAN

Shutup boy, no one's callin' the

authorities if there's no harm done.

HI

Thank you sir.

ED

Thank you sir.

NATHAN

Aw bullshit. Just tell me - just

tell me why you did it.

ED

We can't have our own.

NATHAN

...Well lookit. If you can't have

kids you gotta just keep tryin' and

hope medical science catches up with

you. Like Florence'n me - it caught

up with a vengeance. And hell, even

if it never does, you still got each

other.

HI

Sir, those're kind words. But I think

the wife and me are splittin' up...

HI

...Her point of view is we're both

kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we

ain't too good for each other.

NATHAN

Well ma'am, I don't know much but I

do know human bein's. You brought

back my boy so you must have your

good points too. I'd sure hate to

think of Florence leavin' me - I do

love her so...

NATHAN

...You can go out the way you came

in...

NATHAN

...And before you go off and do

another foolish thing, like busting

up, I suggest you sleep on it...

NATHAN

...at least one night.

VOICE OVER

That night I had a dream...

VOICE OVER

...I dreamt I was as light as the

ether, a floating spirit visiting

things to come...

VOICE OVER

The shades and shadows of the people

in my life wrastled their way into

my slumber.

VOICE OVER

I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had

decided to return to prison...

VOICE OVER

...Probably that's just as well. I

don't mean to sound superior, and

they're a swell couple guys, but...

VOICE OVER

...maybe they weren't ready yet to

come out into the world.

VOICE OVER

And then I dreamed on, into the

future, to a Christmas morn in the

Arizona home...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...where Nathan Jr. was opening a

present from a kindly couple who

preferred to remain unknown.

VOICE OVER

I saw Glen, a few years later, still

havin' no luck gettin' the cops to

listen to his wild tales about me'n

Ed...

VOICE OVER

...Maybe he threw in one Pollack

joke too many...

VOICE OVER

...I don't know.

VOICE OVER

And still I dreamed on...

VOICE OVER

...further into the future than I'd

ever dreamed before.

VOICE OVER

...Watching Nathan Jr.'s progress

from afar...

VOICE OVER

...Taking pride in his accomplishments

as if he were our own...

VOICE OVER

...Wondering if he ever thought of

us.

VOICE OVER

...and hoping that maybe we'd

broadened his horizons a little,

even if he couldn't remember just

how they'd got broadened.

VOICE OVER

But still I hadn't dreamt nothin'

about me'n Ed. Until the end...

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

VOICE OVER

...And this was cloudier 'cause it

was years, years away.

VOICE OVER

...But I saw an old couple bein'

visited by their children - and all

their grandchildren too. And the old

couple wasn't screwed up, and neither

were their kids or their grandkids.

And I don't know, you tell me. This

whole dream, was it wishful thinking?

Was I just fleein' reality, like I

know I'm liable to do?

VOICE OVER

...But me'n Ed, we can be good too...

VOICE OVER

...And it seemed real. It seemed

like us. And it seemed like well...

our home... If not Arizona, then a

land, not too far away, where all

parents are strong and wise and

capable, and all children are happy

and beloved... I dunno, maybe it was

Utah.

FADE OUT
