"FATAL INSTINCT"

Screenplay by

David O'Malley

SHOOTING DRAFT

NED (V.O.)

To some guys, women are like a cheap

puzzle... with pieces that just don't

fit. They think the soul of a woman

is darker than a back alley... more

tangled than a telephone cord... and

colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada.

But those guys don't even have a

clue.

NED (V.O.)

When you know women the way I do,

you understand exactly what what

makes them tick... what makes them

hum... what makes them jiggle up and

down when they walk. And it's not

the kind of thing you can learn from

a correspondence course.

NED (V.O.)

There are two kinds of women in this

world... and I've known 'em both.

NED (V.O.)

One will take you for a fast ride on

a bumpy road with no seat belt. But

the other kind...

ARCH

(interrupts)

Jeez... knock off the chatter, will

ya.

NED

Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

ARCH

I'm awake! Where do you come up with

all that crap about women?

NED

It's true. Women are very complex,

but if you know how to read 'em...

they're an open book. You can always

tell the rotten apples from the

peaches.

ARCH

Are you kiddin'?

NED

I'd stake my career on it. Anybody

ever proves me wrong, I'll throw

away my badge.

ARCH

Aayyhh... women are trouble...

NED

I used to believe that too. Until I

married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

ARCH

Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,

pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a

beautiful wife waitin' for ya at

home. Everything a guy could ever

want, including NO kids.

NED

I'd love to have kids.

ARCH

What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!

(looks around)

Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes

you think Milo's gonna show up here?

NED

Logic. He knocked off all those banks.

He's got cash. He's gonna want to

spend it. This is one of the few

places that still takes cash. Sooner

or later... he's gotta turn up.

ARCH

And how we s'posed to recognize this

scumbag?

NED

The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you

see him... you'll know him.

ARCH

These are the best damn Nachos in

North America. Maybe the world!

ARCH

I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.

You want some?

LOLA

Got a light?

NED

Sure.

LOLA

How about a match?

NED

No thanks. I have plenty.

LOLA

You really are incredibly stupid,

aren't you? I like that in a man.

NED

I'd be insulted, but I know you're

serious.

LOLA

You sound so sure of yourself.

NED

I'm not as dumb as I look.

LOLA

Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...

NED

Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?

LOLA

Thirsty. What about that drink?

NED

I'm on duty.

LOLA

Brain surgeon?

NED

Cop.

LOLA

Oooo... and I bet you have a big

gun.

NED

You lose.

LOLA

If I can't buy you a drink...

(nods toward vendor)

...let me buy you one of those.

NED

Who can say no to a weiner?

LOLA

Not me.

LOLA

Two dogs. Hot.

NED

You come here often?

LOLA

Only when I'm in heat.

NED

Oh! Sorry.

LOLA

Where ya going?

NED

Get something to wipe it off.

LOLA

That's okay. You're doing just fine.

NED

I'll get you a wet paper towel.

NED

Hold it right there, Milo!

RESTROOM PATRON

Look out! He's got a weenie!

NED

Police emergency! I need your car!

NED

You take science in high school,

Milo?

MILO

I skipped high school, cop!

NED

Then you're probably not familiar

with the theory of inverse

proportionate explosive dynamics.

MILO

What about it?

NED

If you fire a weapon with the barrel

obstructed, the explosive force

multiplies by twenty-three point

five nine eight and reverses on itself

with diametric polarity?

MILO

Yeah. So?

NED

The gun will blow up in your hand...

and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

MILO

Ha! That's just theoretical

hypothesis. Inverse proportionate

explosive dynamics has never been

demonstrated conclusively in a

laboratory environment.

NED

Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart

guy. Let's find out.

NED

You have the right to remain silent...

next... if you waive that right,

anything you say... next...

NED

...may be used against you in a court

of law... next... You have the right

to an attorney... Do you have an

attorney?

MILO

Nahhhh!

NED

Then today's your lucky day...

DISSOLVE TO:

LANA (O.S.)

Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by

ten percent! That's it.

(CLUNK! A wrench)

Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes!

(THUNK! Pliers)

You got it! Stabilize your ball joints

and grind my rear differential!

(CLINK! Screwdriver)

Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber,

baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!

LANA

Not bad for an auto mechanic...

FRANK

(grins, cocky)

Yeah, well you're not so bad

yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

LANA

Better watch your tongue, sweetie,

or I'll have my husband arrest you.

FRANK

Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When

does he ever find time for you?

LANA

He doesn't. That's why I need you to

keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why

drive a jalopy when you can have a

hot rod?

FRANK

Maybe you should trade him in on a

new model.

LANA

I would... if I could make any money

on the deal.

FRANK

(reaches for her)

Want to go for another test drive?

LANA

Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm

still under warranty.

NED

Morning sweetheart.

LANA

Uh huh. Want some coffee?

NED

No thanks.

LANA

Frank here was just grabbing a little

before going back to work on my car.

NED

How long you been working on Lana's

Mercedes, Frank?

FRANK

(shrugs)

Oh... I don't know... six, seven

weeks.

NED

And ya still haven't found the

problem?

FRANK

(a leering smile)

Think I got my finger on it though.

NED

I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't

born yesterday. He's not fixing your

car. He's SCREWING you!

NED

YOU are screwing my wife! I can see

what your game is, Frank. You open

up her hood, poke around in there...

squirt some lubrication in... play

around with all her parts... then

take an old used piston and stick it

in... then pull it out... in, out,

in, out! Every day! There's no end

to it. You just keep coming and

COMING!... and the bill just gets

bigger and BIGGER!

NED

But you don't see it, do you, Lana?

You're too good... too pure. You

can't see the evil in people like

him.

(turns to Frank)

Well, you're not getting away with

it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're

fired!

LANA

(breathless)

Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

NED

(checks his watch)

Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late

for court.

NED

You are so naive.

NED

Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

FRANK

Who's that?

LANA

Just the postman. He always rings

twice.

NED

Laura... do you know where...?

LAURA

(hands him file)

Right here. The judge decided to

skip arraignment and take Milo direct

to trial. You're six minutes late,

but don't sweat it. You got Judge

Allen. He's always eleven minutes

late.

LAURA

I suggest you try Lemming versus

Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped

in the water and everybody followed.

NED

(thinks about it)

Yeah. Good idea.

NED

I don't know what I'd do without

you?

LAURA

Really?

NED

Laura, how long have you worked for

me?

LAURA

Two years, seven months, twenty-three

days, nineteen hours...

(checks her watch)

...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.

(softly, to herself)

...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-

five... fifty-six...

NED

And when was the last time I gave

you a raise?

LAURA

Never. But that's okay. I don't need

a raise. In fact... I was thinking

of giving you a rebate on my salary.

NED

Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

LAURA'S HUSBAND

Did we forget something?

LAURA'S HUSBAND

Did we forget something?

NED

Laura. Laura! What is it?

LAURA

(coming out of it)

I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a

bit... claustrophobic... in the

bathroom.

NED

Maybe we should try some prune juice.

LAURA

Wear the blue one.

NED

Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...

does this look like the face of a

crook?

NED

Of course it does. But the question

of my client's guilt or innocence is

not the issue here today. I'm certain

every member of the jury can clearly

see that he's guilty!

BLIND JUROR

I can't.

NED

Put yourself in his shoes. Look

through his eyes. See the world the

way HE sees it!

NED

Things just don't look the same.

It's fuzzy... and frightening!

NED

Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley

is not the perpetrator here. He is

the VICTIM!

NED

Like ALL of us... this man is the

unfortunate victim of these tragically

difficult economic times. And what

does that mean? He can't support his

family!

NED

For God's sake!... He can't even

support his own FACE!

JUDGE ALLEN

Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum

in my courtroom... unless you have

enough for everyone.

JUDGE ALLEN

Bailiff. Pass these out.

JUDGE ALLEN

And don't forget the jury.

NED

And so, desperate and broke, with no

other options before him, Mr. Crumley

went to eleven Savings & Loans and

did what any of you would have done.

He stole back the money that the

S&Ls had stolen from him!

JUDGE ALLEN

(interrupting)

Mr. Ravine... please approach the

bench.

JUDGE ALLEN

You're not running for congress here,

so knock off the speeches and quit

inciting these brainless morons! Now

pick up the pace and wrap this son-

of-a-bitch up! Call your first

witness.

NED

I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

BAILIFF

Do you swear to tell the truth, the

whole truth and nothing but the truth,

so help you God?

NED

I do.

NED

Detective Ravine, at the time of the

arrest, did you read the defendant

his Miranda rights?

NED

Of course. That's standard procedure.

NED

Are these the cards Officer Brooks

used to prompt you while reading Mr.

Crumley his rights?

NED

Yeah. These are them.

NED

Reading from the cards now... quote

"You have the right to remain silent,

if you waive that right, anything

you say... may be used against you

in a court of law." Is that right?

NED

(back in the chair)

That's right.

NED

(stands up, announces)

WRONG! The official Miranda warning

is... "anything you say CAN be used

against you in a court of law." Not

"may"... "CAN!"

(on the attack)

Don't you know the difference between

"can" and "may", Detective? Every

school kid knows "can" is a verb

that indicates ability to perform,

while "may" is a verbal auxiliary

indicating the permission to act.

NED

I didn't have time to worry about

past participles or interrogative

pronouns! I was trying to protect

society from a deranged MADMAN!

(leaps up, pointing)

But this ivy league fop...!!!

NED

I have no more use for this witness.

JUDGE ALLEN

Mr. Ravine...

JUDGE ALLEN

I'm dismissing this case on the

grounds of improper grammar.

NED

Ow!

PROSECUTOR

(jumps up)

But your Honor...!

JUDGE ALLEN

I know, I know. It's a technicality.

But it's the kind of technicality

that makes the American legal system

what it is today! Court's adjourned!

LOLA

I waited. You never came back.

NED

I got busy. Here's that paper towel

I promised.

LOLA

Thanks...

NED

How'd you get in? The door was locked.

LOLA

It's miraculous what a real woman

can do... with a bobbie pin.

LOLA

(offering)

Cigarette?

NED

No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

LOLA

Yes, I know. I like things that are

bad for me.

(touching lawbooks)

So... I hear you go both ways.

NED

Only once. It was a fraternity prank.

I never saw him again.

LOLA

No, I mean... you're a cop and a

lawyer.

NED

Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of

scum out there on the streets... but

they all deserve a fair and costly

trial.

LAURA

I'll get that.

NED

Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

LOLA

Lola Cain.

LOLA

(sarcastic)

So lovely to meet you, Laura.

NED

Gotta keep these darn books in their

right place or we'll never find the

ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...

R thru B... W thru F...

LAURA

It's getting late. I'll give you a

ride home, Ned.

NED

I have my car.

LAURA

I'll tow you.

NED

Not today. You don't need to wait.

I'll see you tomorrow.

LAURA

I should call someone to fix this...

NED

Tomorrow...

LAURA

I'll call from home.

LOLA

I think I should warn you, Mr.

Ravine... I'm not wearing any

underwear.

NED

Try these on.

NED

So... what can I do for you?

LOLA

I've run across some... papers...

and I thought you might be able to

tell me what they are. You see, I'm

not very experienced when it comes

to... papers.

NED

I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.

Do you have the... papers... here?

LOLA

No... they're at home. I thought you

might stop by...

NED

I'm on duty tonight.

LOLA

Don't they ever give you a night

off?

NED

Yeah. Tomorrow.

LOLA

(picks up cigarette)

Why don't we meet tomorrow evening

then?

LOLA

I'll let you know where.

NED

(steps over to her)

What's wrong with my office?

LOLA

Nothing a good interior decorator

couldn't fix.

LOLA

Take care of this for me, will ya?

FRANK

I came back for my shower cap.

LANA

Yeah, well you came to the right

place.

LANA

Sit down.

FRANK

Where is he?

LANA

On duty all night. By the time he

wraps up his reports, it'll be close

to noon tomorrow.

LANA

I was just reading over...

LANA

Take off the hat, Frank.

LANA

I was just reading over my husband's

insurance policies. You wouldn't

know anything about insurance, would

you, Frankie?

FRANK

Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies

part-time. I got half a brain... or

didn't you notice?

LANA

I musta had my eye on something else.

(hands him papers)

How about a translation.

FRANK

Standard accident policy... all the

usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The

face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three

million bucks!

(flips page)

And there's a triple indemnity rider.

LANA

Meaning?

FRANK

Aw, it's just something agents throw

in so we can boost the premium. If

the policy holder dies under very

specific conditions, it pays off

three times the face value of the

policy.

LANA

Nine million dollars...?

FRANK

Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the

company. Nobody ever collects.

LANA

Why not?

FRANK

Well, like here... it only pays off

if he's shot with a pistol, falls

from a moving northbound train and

drowns in a fresh water stream.

LANA

All three?

FRANK

See what I mean, sweetheart? What

are the odds of that?

LANA

It could happen.

(dramatic beat)

Suppose it did happen?

FRANK

Then you'd be rich.

LANA

Then we'd be rich.

FRANK

What're you sayin'...?

LANA

We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!

And I know exactly how! He has a

legal symposium in Santa Barbara

this weekend... All we have to do is

get him to take the train up instead

of driving.

FRANK

How we gonna do that? Didn't you

tell me he hates trains?

LANA

That's where you come in, baby. You're

gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.

That should be no problem for you.

LANA

Then... we give him a lift to the

train station... through Dealey Plaza,

past the Book Suppository and around

the grassy knoll...

FRANK

Isn't that out of our way?

LANA

Move, Frank.

LANA

And pay attention.

LANA

Ten minutes out of the station he'll

be standing in the vestibule between

cars... trying to avoid a panic

attack. Fourteen minutes and ten

seconds out, the train crosses the

Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen

minutes and fifty-four seconds, I

shoot him, shove him out the door...

he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!

A triple play. We're rich!

FRANK

You been thinking about this a lot,

haven't you?

LANA

No. It just came to me.

(closer, seductive)

I had this image of a big, powerful,

throbbing train... plunging into a

long, dark, wet tunnel.

NED

Stand over there and shut up!

GANG MEMBER #1

Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you

be layin' no deleterious malfeasance

on us.

NED

Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want

to hear language like that!

ARCH

Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.

You seem a little tense tonight.

What is it?

NED

Aw... I don't know. I guess it's

Lana. It's just... I know she wants

to have a baby so bad...

NED

...but I never get to spend any time

with her. And when I am home... it's

like she's, you know... avoiding

sex.

GANG MEMBER #1

You should try to be more sensitive,

man. More romantic. Bring her flowers.

GANG MEMBER #1

Try to understand how she feels.

After all...

GANG MEMBER #1

She may be weary... Women do get

weary... Wearing that same old shabby

dress... But when she's weary... Try

a little ten-der-ness...

NED

That can't be it. I'm the tenderest

guy on the force. Nah... I think

she's just afraid she won't be able

to get pregnant.

ARCH

What's to be afraid! It's like making

breakfast! You bring home the bacon...

she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it

up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got

an omelette in the oven!

(a beat, then)

Why don't you knock off early... go

home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake

up in the morning and find you there

for a change.

NED

Naw... I can't. I got all this

paperwork.

ARCH

Don't worry about that.

GANG MEMBER #1

We'll do our own paperwork, man!

OTHER GANG MEMBERS

Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

WILLARD SCOTT

(on television)

...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of

Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and

thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of

female! Smokes three cigars a day,

drinks a straight shot of vodka at

bedtime... and still has sex!

NED

Damn birds!

LAURA

My God, Ned... you look like you

were hit by a bus.

NED

I was.

(notices)

Who's in my office?

LAURA

Max Shady's mother.

NED

Not again.

NED

Hello, Mrs. Shady.

NED

Laura... check on my insurance. Make

sure it's paid up.

MRS. SHADY

Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,

is getting out of prison tomorrow.

NED

(checks his watch)

Gee, has it been seven years already?

MRS. SHADY

Seven long, miserable years in the

slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

NED

Well, being locked in a tiny room

with no TV can make a guy feel pretty

tense.

MRS. SHADY

I'm very concerned about him, Mr.

Ravine. He said you were a two-bit

shyster... and he's going to rip

your head off and use it for a bowling

ball!

NED

I'm sure the experience wasn't all

negative. He probably made a lot of

friends...

MRS. SHADY

(ever hopeful)

You think?

NED

...learned a useful trade...

MRS. SHADY

Oh yes... live autopsies...

NED

...caught up on all those books he

wanted to read...

MRS. SHADY

Maybe so... but he said he's going

to punch you in the testicles...

MRS. SHADY

...smash your face...

MRS. SHADY

...and decimate your wardrobe.

MRS. SHADY

And I wouldn't want that to happen.

(spanks his butt)

He's a naughty naughty boy. I just

thought I should warn you.

MRS. SHADY

(to Laura)

Bye for now.

(pauses by desk)

Oh... may I have a cookie?

LAURA

(at file cabinet)

Sure.

MRS. SHADY

Thank yooooooooou.

LAURA

Oh my God, Ned.

NED

I hate when she comes to see me.

LAURA

Don't you realize, Ned?... you could

be in real danger.

NED

(sees file)

What's that?

LAURA

Extreme peril. You know, the risk of

personal bodily harm.

NED

(points at file)

No... I mean that.

LAURA

Your insurance file. But the policy's

missing. Did you take it home?

NED

I don't think so.

LAURA

Oh, wait a second...

LAURA'S HUSBAND

Lau-raaaaa!

NED

Laura! Are you alright? That was a

very long flashback you had.

LAURA

Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a

little... pre-menstrual.

LAURA

That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped

by. She left this!

NED

Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked

me to take care of this.

LOLA

Thanks...

NED

You smoke too much.

(looks around, then)

It's hot tonight.

LOLA

Is it? I never know. My body heat

runs about twenty degrees above

normal.

NED

Maybe we should look for a cooler

place.

LOLA

I doubt we'll find one. Even the

wind chimes on my porch aren't moving

much these days. They keep thudding

softly, like dairy cows bumping butts

in the night. I go out there expecting

to find a cool breeze... but it's

just a lot of hot air.

NED

What're they lookin' at?

LOLA

A lot of them have tried that seat.

You're the first one's lasted this

long.

NED

I feel honored.

LOLA

Don't. It's broken.

NED

Did you bring the... papers?

LOLA

No. I thought you might come over...

NED

Sure. I'll drive you.

LOLA

I brought my own car.

NED

I'll follow you then.

LOLA

I know it sounds silly, but would

you leave first... wait in your car?

I come here a lot and I wouldn't

want those men to think I'm "easy"...

a slut who'll jump into bed with

anyone at the drop of a hat. But if

you leave first...

NED

...they'll think I'm a putz for

passing up a sure thing.

LOLA

(for all to hear)

Now leave me alone!

NED

Well, here we are... in the dark.

LOLA

I have The Clapper.

NED

You what?

LOLA

My wind chimes.

NED

You know, these would work a lot

better if you took them out of the

boxes.

LOLA

Well well... I guess you have been

around. I'm impressed.

NED

Why don't we take a look at those...

papers?

LOLA

(remembering)

Papers. Right.

NED

That's it? These are the... papers?

LOLA

Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can

you tell me what they are?

NED

This one's a laundry receipt... and

the other one's an expired lottery

ticket.

LOLA

No. You keep them... as a memento of

our time together.

LOLA

I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay

you for all you've done?

NED

Cash would be nice.

LOLA

Isn't there some other way?

NED

I suppose you could wash my car.

LOLA

No, I mean, isn't there something

else you want? Something I could

give you?

NED

Hey... slow down... there's a speed

limit in this state. Sixty-five miles

an hour.

LOLA

How fast was I going, officer?

NED

Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

LOLA

Suppose you pull me over and frisk

me?

NED

Suppose I let you off with a warning?

LOLA

Suppose I find a cop with a bigger

nightstick?

NED

Suppose I put you under arrest for

being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

LOLA

Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

NED

(rapid run-on)

Suppose I do and then we lose the

key and while I'm gone to get a

duplicate made the house catches on

fire and I can't get back to save

you because the bridge is washed out

and so you die a horrible death

toasted like a Polish sausage on a

flaming spit!

(shakes his head)

Nah... I better be going.

LOLA

You're not so tough. Last chance.

NED

No thanks. I got a cold shower and a

wife who trusts me waiting at home.

LOLA

What's the matter? Don't you want

me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

NED

Don't forget to lock up.

LOLA

I knew you'd come back...

NED

(looking past her)

I forgot my car keys.

LOLA

That's not what you came back for.

NED

Yes it is.

LOLA

(breathless)

...don't... stop...

LOLA

...Oh Ned... please... don't...

stop...

LOLA

That takes care of foreplay.

GUARD

It's time, Max.

MATCH CUT TO:

REPORTER #1

Mr. Shady! What's the first thing

you're gonna do now that you're out?

MAX SHADY

Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off

and use it for a bowling ball!

REPORTER #2

Are you a good bowler?

REPORTER #3

You ever bowled a three-hundred game?

REPORTER #4

How would you handle a seven-ten

split?

REPORTER #1

Say, aren't you wearing one of

Ravine's "trademark" blue suits?

MAX SHADY

Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a

gift... to make up for losing my

case. Now I'm going to wear it to

his friggin' funeral!!

MAX SHADY

Ma!

NED

That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

LOLA

Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

NED

(listening)

Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.

LOLA

It tells the sad story of a woman

who is rejected by her lover after a

brief, but torrid, affair... so she

stalks him with an ice pick and stabs

him with it more than a thousand

times.

NED

Really? I never could understand the

lyrics.

NED

You know, what happened last night

was very, uh...

LOLA

Yes... it was. I should check on my

homeowners insurance.

NED

But we can't ever let it happen again.

Ever!

LOLA

What are you saying, Ned? That you're

rejecting me, your lover, after a

brief, but torrid, affair?!

NED

I wouldn't put it exactly like that.

It's just that... well, I'm married

to a wonderful woman... who is very,

very attractive...

(but adds quickly)

...not that you aren't very

attractive!

NED

(voice echoing)

...you aren't very attractive... you

aren't very attractive... you aren't

very attractive...

CLERK

Don't touch anything. You bond with

it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

NED

I'd like to buy a pet.

CLERK

Yeah. For what purpose?

NED

It's a gift... for my wife.

CLERK

Right. They all say that.

NED

She spends a lot of time alone. I

thought it might be nice if she had

something to keep her company.

CLERK

Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know

you're not the kind of guy who punches

out parakeets? Or takes some poor

defenseless animal, throws it in a

sack and runs over it with your car

five or six times.

NED

I would never hurt an animal.

CLERK

Boy, I would. They're driving me

CRAZY!

CLERK

Shuddup!

CLERK

Okay... tell me more about this broad

you're married to. I like to match

people with the pets they deserve.

ARCH

Uh-uh.

NED

(doubtful)

You do all my paperwork?

NED

Get out of here.

ARCH

And a damn good job, too. One of 'em

even did it in Spanish.

ARCH

Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

MAX (O.S.)

(on T.V.)

...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's

throat and pull out his guts with my

bare hands!

ARCH

(shocked)

Jesus... you hear that?

NED

He's just working through his anger,

trying to find a constructive outlet.

ARCH

Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The

guy's a friggin' looney!

NED

Trust me, I spent a lot of time with

him when I was preparing his case.

He's really a very sweet, sensitive

human being.

MAX

(on T.V.)

I'd like to mash his head like a

ripe melon...

NED

He gets a little melon-dramatic.

MAX

(on T.V.)

...then cut off all his fingers and

rip out his liver with my teeth!

NED

(shrugs)

See. Loves to exaggerate.

ARCH

Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

NED

Lieutenant Ravine.

LOLA

I want to see you, Ned.

NED

(whispering harshly)

I told you not to call me! It's

finished between us. No. No, I'm not

sucking anything of yours anymore!

(voice gets louder)

It's done! OVER!

NED

(shrugs it off)

Wrong number.

FRANK

How come we gotta meet here?

LANA

We have to be careful now. We can't

risk being seen together at the house

or someone might connect us to the

murder later on.

LANA

Here... put this on.

LANA

(whispers to Frank)

Speak Yiddish.

FRANK

What?

LANA

Red Yiddish.

FRANK

Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der

nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen.

(I been thinkin'...

maybe this plan is

too complicated.)

LANA

Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz

(Quit worrying. The

plan is perfect.)

FRANK

Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.

Un schissen un schtippen in vasser

(Yeah, but we gotta

get him on the train,

shoot him... then

push him in the river.

There's a million

ways we can screw

up.)

LANA

Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen

(You're not going

soft on me, are you?)

FRANK

Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?

(When have I ever

gone soft on you?)

LANA

Lest'n Yomkippur.

(Last Yom Kippur.)

FRANK

Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie

(Okay... once! It

happens to every

guy.)

FRANK

Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.

Me'vet unz chap'n.

(We're going to be in

big trouble. They're

going to catch us.)

OLDER GENTLEMAN

There's very little risk involved.

Statistics reveal that less than

thirty-two percent of all murderers

are ever apprehended.

LANA

You speak Yiddish?

OLDER GENTLEMAN

No. But I can read sub-titles.

SUB-TITLE

Oy vay!

LAURA

Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

NED

I didn't. It's for my wife.

LAURA

She called. Wondered why you never

came home last night. I told her you

were working with a client,

undercover.

LAURA

Were you?

NED

What?

LAURA

There's lipstick on your collar.

NED

No there isn't.

LAURA

No... there isn't. But you answered

my question. She's a real looker,

huh?

NED

Who?

LAURA

Lola Cain.

NED

I hadn't noticed.

LAURA

Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't

noticed.

(returns to work)

That's alright. She noticed enough

for both of us.

LAURA

I worry about you, Ned. I worry a

lot.

(hands him papers)

Max Shady's been faxing death threats

to you all morning.

NED

(reading bits)

...stick a knife in your...

(reacts, next)

...rip the eyeballs out of your...

(next)

...drive razor-sharp spikes under

your...

LAURA

Did you get to the one...?

NED

...cut it off... shove it in a

blender.

LAURA

Yeah... that one.

NED

(tosses them aside)

He's just getting it out of his

system. Once they say it... they

never do it. You know... like the

President.

LAURA

(whispers)

Wait. It might be him.

NED

Where did you get that?

LAURA

(as if obvious)

From my purse.

NED

What are you doing with it?

LAURA

(still obvious)

Handing it to you.

NED

Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun

for?

LAURA

You shoot it. A bullet comes out.

Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a

cop, I'd think you'd know these

things.

NED

Laura... put the gun away.

DELIVERY MAN

(checks card)

Flowers for Ned Rav...

(looks up)

Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?

Man, you are dead meat!

LAURA

Is this another sick joke from Max

Shady?

NED

What is it...?

LAURA

(hands it to him)

Lola Cain.

LAURA

I'll put these in water for you.

LOLA'S VOICE

Ned, darling... I know this seems

like a strange way to talk with you...

but since you won't take my calls, I

have no other choice.

(then suddenly)

Watch it! That red car's turning

left!

LOLA'S VOICE

I love you, Ned. We're meant to be

together... forever.

(then suddenly)

The light's changing! Floor it! Go!

Go! Go!

LOLA'S VOICE

Nice move!

(then sincere again)

Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not

even your wife. I'd hate to have to

tell her about us, but if necessary...

I will.

LANA

What happened to you last night?

NED

(guilty as charged)

Why? What have you heard?

LANA

(sarcastic)

You could have called. But then, I

suppose you were tied up.

NED

(reflecting back)

Only part of the time.

LANA

I never know when you're coming home,

Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

NED

I promise I'll spend more time with

you. I know it's been rough, being

alone so much. But I'll make it up

to you. Maybe we should try again,

you know... to have a baby.

LANA

So what's in the box?

NED

Oh... I brought you a present!

LANA

What is it?

NED

It's... sorta like a cat.

LANA

Not enough like a cat.

NED

It's a little skunk. I got it at

Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

NED

So... what're you going to name him?

LANA

How about... Ned?

NED

(thinks about it)

Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've

always liked the name Ned.

LANA

No kidding.

NED

So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior

as much as you love me?

LANA

At least.

LANA

Hello?... Hello?... Hello?

(then, whispering)

Frank? Is that you?

LANA

(filtered)

I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

LOLA

Who's Frank?

NED

Frank? The only Frank I know is an

auto mechanic... but I sure as hell

wouldn't recommend the guy. He's

really slow.

LOLA

I had to see you, Ned. I need to

feel your arms around me! I wanna

suck your toes til the nails pop

off!

NED

I told you, what happened was a big

mistake. A one night stand. It's

over. I have a wife...

LOLA

It doesn't matter. She'll know all

about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In

my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

LOLA

I got us tickets to see Iron

Butterfly!

NED

I hate opera!

LOLA

Why are you running from me? Didn't

it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing

my buns with carnuba wax?

(looks down)

Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey

want to go exploring?

NED

He's busy right now.

NED

Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a

big mistake! One lousy mistake in

his whole stinkin' life! So why don't

you give him a BREAK! Besides... he

belongs to my wife!

JUDGE ARUGULA

I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey

for setting yet another unusual legal

precedent. This is the first time

I've ever tried a case in which the

JURY was found to be insane.

BAILIFF

(to another Juror)

What're you? A thirty-eight long?

JUDGE ARUGULA

The jury will be remanded to the

Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi

Valley. Court's adjourned.

NED

Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you

tell me?

LAURA

It's not important. I just had one

last year.

NED

Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

LAURA

Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll

have another one sometime.

NED

I insist. And I want to get you a

nice present.

LAURA

You're so sweet. You don't have to.

You gave me a present last year.

Those lovely Ginzu knives.

NED

Yeah... aren't they great! They last

forever. And you can cut right through

a shoe with 'em!

NED

It's nice to be off the streets...

away from all the pain and misery

out there.

LAURA (V.O.)

What's he thinking when he looks at

me with that goofy smile...?

NED (V.O.)

Boy, does she look stupid in that

hat.

LAURA (V.O.)

If I told him how I really feel,

he'd probably fire me. What am I

saying? He probably doesn't even

know I exist.

NED (V.O.)

Laura's incredible. And so smart.

Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu

knives are the gift of a lifetime.

(then, concerned)

But she never goes out with guys. I

wonder why?

LAURA (V.O.)

I guess I'll just have to wait. But

he's married. I could wait forever.

Than again... maybe Lana will get

hit by a runaway truck. There's always

a chance that...

NED (V.O.)

(interrupting)

But who cares if she... Oh, sorry.

LAURA (V.O.)

That's alright. I was just rambling.

NED (V.O.)

Go ahead...

LAURA (V.O.)

No, no, really... you first...

NED (V.O.)

I insist... please...

LAURA

Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind

you about...

NED

...the Legal Symposium...

LAURA

...in Santa Barbara...

NED

...tomorrow...

NED & LAURA

(in unison)

..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

NED

Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

LAURA (V.O.)

He's so cute. He can't even look me

in the eye.

LAURA

(touching his arm)

What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

NED

(sighs, reluctant)

I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel

passion at one time or another. Even

me.

LAURA

(hopeful)

Really?

NED

What would you think of a married

man who gave in to those wild,

sensual, raging desires?

LAURA

Oh... wow... golly...

NED

What if, for just one crazy moment,

he couldn't resist...? He got knocked

for a loop and lost control?

LAURA

(smiles, eager)

Gosh... that might be okay.

NED

What if a tidal wave of lust crashed

over him and he was sucked into a

vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

NED

Well... it's not your problem. I'll

work it out.

LOLA

(to Laura)

Like some ice for your drink?

LOLA

Does your wife know you're...

"working" late? I certainly hope so,

Mr. Ravine.

LANA

Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

FRANK

(whispering)

It's all taken care of. When do I

knock on the door?

LANA

Wait until I signal you. When I raise

the blinds... you knock.

LANA

Not now!

FRANK

Oh, later... right... okay.

LANA

Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-

bye to Little Ned. He loves his

daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

NED

(pets the skunk)

See you tonight, Junior.

LANA

What's wrong?

NED

This neighborhood is getting worse

all the time! Damn kids stole my

engine!

LANA

Why don't you catch the train to

Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty

minutes.

NED

I'll just fly up.

LANA

No!

LANA

I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists

seized the airport this morning. A

plane crashed into the tower... and

all the runways are on fire!

NED

Yeah. So?

LANA

And it's fogged in.

NED

(disappointed)

Dammit.

LANA

For my peace of mind... take the

train.

NED

I can't do it. You know how I feel

about riding trains.

LANA

Darling... it's only a short trip.

NED

(reconsiders)

Yeah... right. A short trip.

NED

(he hesitates)

A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

LANA

Just because both your parents died

in a train wreck...

NED

And my brother, Jeff...

LANA

And your brother, Morty...

NED

My two sisters...

LANA

Right...

NED

My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...

Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.

All killed by trains!

LANA

(very convincing)

Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's

the past. They're gone.

NED

(sighs, resigned)

Yeah. I guess I can't bring them

back by not riding on a train.

LANA

That's right.

NED

But I just can't get over this stupid

nagging fear that...

LANA

Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I

don't want to raise a child in a

home filled with fear!

LANA

But if you can conquer your fear...

maybe I can conquer my fear of having

a baby with a father who's fearful.

(goes for broke)

Ned... don't let a train kill our

child before it's even conceived!

NED

(heaves a sigh)

I guess you're right.

LANA

You're sure now...?

NED

But we'll never make it to the

station. By the time a cab gets

here...

FRANK

I was in the neighborhood. Thought

I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

LANA

Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

FRANK

Sure, I'll take you to the train

station.

NED

Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

NED

(checks his watch)

We're not going to make it.

FRANK

We'll make it!

LANA

Okay... now what're you going to do

if you feel queasy going through the

tunnel?

NED

I'll stand in the vestibule between

the cars.

LANA

That's right. When you get queasy...

go stand in the vestibule between

the cars.

WOMAN PASSENGER

OH! My dear gracious!

IRRITABLE MAN

SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish

that foul smelling cigar?

MAX

(turning slowly)

You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU

want me to put out my cigar? You

want ME to put out my CIGAR?

IRRITABLE MAN

Yeah.

MAX

Certainly.

LANA

It's already getting to him. He'll

be out of that seat and into the

vestibule within ten minutes... I

guarantee it.

MAX

You talkin' to me? You talkin' to

ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

CONDUCTOR

Ticket?

CONDUCTOR

Sorry pal... automatic weapons are

only allowed in the club car after

nine p.m.

CONDUCTOR

I'll check it with baggage. You can

claim it at the depot in Santa

Barbara.

JEFF

Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years

old. Didja know if ya put a penny on

the track it'll make the train crash?

No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?

My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really

neat. Everybody gets creamed! All

bloody guts... heads ripped off and

stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song

"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy

Gopher Guts"?

LANA

You want to earn a couple bucks,

kid?

JEFF

Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years

old. Didja know if ya put a penny on

the track it'll make the train crash?

LANA

He's losing it. You better get up to

the next car. Remember, give me the

high sign as soon as you see the

river. It'll be two minutes and nine

seconds past the tunnel. I'll take

care of the rest. Anything goes

wrong... just make sure you back me

up.

(grabs his collar)

And don't let him see you.

NED

This... is not a toy!

JEFF

Yes it is.

MAX

Here... let me help you with that.

OLD WOMAN

What a nice young man. You are so

polite.

MAX

(smiles)

I try to be.

JEFF

Great green gobs of greasy, grimy

gopher guts... mutilated monkey

meat... chopped up dirty birdie's

feet... one pint jar of all-purpose

porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan

stew.

JEFF

(still singing)

French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs

you wanna pick... stuff to make your

mother sick... dog poop on a stick...

puke and snot all mixed together in

a pot...

JEFF

Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

LANA

Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

MAX

You shootin' at me?

MAX

Yeah... you're definitely shootin'

at me.

NED

In this crazy world, there's not a

whole lot a guy can count on. But

when the chips are down, I can always

count on you.

NED

You risked your life to save mine. A

guy can't ask any more from a woman

than that.

NED

But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In

cold blood. I gotta arrest you for

murder.

LANA

Ned... you wouldn't...

NED

Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to

do.

LANA

But... you said it yourself. I saved

your life.

NED

Don't worry, baby. I know a good

lawyer.

REPORTER #1

What kind of gun did she use?

NED

That's a question for the arresting

officer.

REPORTER #2

Aren't you the arresting officer?

NED

You'll have to ask her attorney.

REPORTER #1

But aren't you her attorney?

NED

Only her husband can answer that.

REPORTER #3

What will Mrs. Ravine be wearing at

the trial?

NED

A lovely powder blue dress with a

cinch waist, full bodice and a

delicately pleated skirt.

REPORTER #3

Does it have a matching jacket?

NED

No comment.

REPORTER #3

Is it cotton or rayon?

NED

(perturbed)

I said... NO COMMENT!

REPORTER #1

(calling out)

Did she eat any of the victim's body

parts?

NED

Jeez... they're really throwing some

tough questions out there today.

LAURA

They're just doing their job.

NED

Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech

lynching of an uppity white

housewife."

NED

(seeing the cage)

What's this?

ARCH

Only cell available. They had that

serial killer locked up here... you

know, the one who talks his victims

to death then eats them... Hannibal

the Lecturer. But they let him out

for a three week tour to publicize

his new book.

NED

(reading the cover)

"To Serve Man."

ARCH

It's a cookbook.

ARCH

And look, look... he autographed it.

NED

(reads it)

To Arch... Love to have you for dinner

sometime... Hannibal.

(hands it back)

Very nice.

ARCH

They're waiting for ya. They didn't

want to start without her attorney

being present.

LANA

PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could

use a good exterminator.

INVESTIGATOR # 2

(to Police Guard)

Let's get the SWAT Team in here.

LANA

Can't you get me out of this cage,

Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

NED

Judge said no bail. Don't worry.

Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

NED

Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

INVESTIGATOR 1

It's your collar... your bust...

your call... your show... your play...

your move... your wife...

NED

Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

INVESTIGATOR 2

Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup

allowed in this building.

LANA

What're you gonna do... arrest me

for primping?

NED

Don't give us a tough time. Just

spill it! What were you doing on

that train?

LANA

Well...

NED

(confidential)

As your attorney, I must advise you...

you don't have to answer that

question.

NED

Alright, quit playing games with us!

(fires questions)

Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get

the gun? What's your link with the

CIA?

LANA

I...

NED

Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I

will not tolerate this unwarranted

badgering of my client. She'll have

her day in court, gentlemen.

NED

I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,

for being so cooperative with these

gentlemen.

(turns to Laura)

Did you get all that down, Laura.

Every word she said?

LAURA

Yep. Both of 'em.

NED

NO!

LOLA

Yes.

NED

NOOOOO!

LOLA

Yes!

NED

NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!

LOLA

YES! Cappelini pomodoro!

NED

What?

LOLA

Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta?

You don't like Italian?

NED

Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!

LOLA

I thought he might like to get out,

so I took him to the amusement park.

NED

You can't just break into my house,

cook my food... borrow my skunk!

(opens the door)

Leave me alone. Stay out of my face!

Out of my neighborhood! Out of my

LIFE!

LOLA

You haven't seen the last of me,

Ned.

LOLA

I told you.

COMMENTATOR

Once again, Americans are making a

mockery of their courts, turning a

murder trial into a media circus!

How can justice ever prevail when it

is ridiculed and reviled in such a

heinously revolting manner? This is

Clement Von Franckenstein returning

you to our BBC studios in London for

the latest photographs of Lady Di

naked in the bath.

SPORTSCASTER

What a great day for a trial! We

have lots of incandescent lighting,

seventy-two degrees inside... and no

wind!

BAILIFF

Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of

Los Angeles is now in session. And

here he is... direct from a triumphant

one-week engagement in Las Vegas

Circuit Court... the honorable...

the venerable... the totally

irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan-

kyyyyyyy!

SPORTSCASTER

Wow... has this defense team been

HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories

this year! Let's go down for the

coin toss.

SPORTSCASTER (V.O.)

The Prosecution wins the flip of the

coin and elects to kick things off.

PROSECUTOR

...the prosecution will prove that

this repulsive and degenerate woman

coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding

citizen...

NED

(jumps up)

Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,

irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca-

doody poo-poo...

JUDGE SKANKY

Sustained.

NED

And can you tell us what this is?

LAURA

Yes. It's a death threat that Max

Shady FAXED to you on the day he was

released from prison.

NED

A FAX in which he threatened to puree

certain parts of my anatomy in a

blender! I'd like to submit this

into evidence.

PROSECUTOR

(jumps up)

Objection! Who cares about the FAX

in this case?

JUDGE SKANKY

I'll allow it.

CHEERLEADERS

U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!

You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-

M-A! How you think you got that way?

Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

NED

And is this the blender you found in

the lavatory of the train?

CONDUCTOR

Yes... it is.

NED

I'd like this marked as evidence.

SPORTSCASTER

Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's

check out the re-play.

SPORTSCASTER

Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide

open! But instead of handing it off,

Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!

The pass is wide! A real wobbler!

There's no way! He scrambles, but he

just can't get his hands on it...

And RIGHT THERE!...

(freezes the frame)

...WHAM! That blender is gone!

LAURA

Ned... did you ever consider that

maybe you don't know women as well

as you think you do?

PROSECUTOR (O.S.)

Now would you tell the court, in

your own words, what you said to Mr.

Ravine?

NED

(whispers)

I'm really worried about this guy.

He could blow our whole case right

out of the water.

JEFF

(singing)

Great green gobs of greasy grimy

gopher guts... mutilated monkey

Great green gobs of greasy grimy

gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

That lady paid me two bucks to sing

it to him...!

JUDGE SKANKY

Recess! Ten minutes!

PROSECUTOR

Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!

LAURA

No you didn't!

NED

No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!

BAILIFF

Recess is over! Let's go... move it,

move it, move it!

SPORTSCASTER

There they go... the UCLA Marching

Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it

looks like the victim's mother...

Helen Shady... is gonna take the

stand! This will be the first

defensive play of the afternoon.

NED

Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about

your son, Max. Was he a... a good

boy?

MRS. SHADY

He was the best. And that's not just

a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

NED

But he got into trouble once in

awhile... like all kids do?

MRS. SHADY

Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes

and things. But he was so cute. I

have pictures!

MRS. SHADY

Here. This is when he set the cat on

fire...

(then, assuring him)

Oh... but the cat deserved it.

NED

(looks, points)

And what, uh... what are these...?

MRS. SHADY

Marshmallows. He just loved to toast

marshmallows over a roaring cat.

Burned on the outside... all soft in

the middle.

(turns page)

And right here... this was taken on

the day he left the priesthood to

join the Green Berets.

NED

This is cute.

MRS. SHADY

(laughs, delighted)

Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux

Klan phase. He would take the sheets

right off my bed... cut those little

holes in them. What a stitch he was!

NED

And is this Max... with all the

tools... fixing his bike?

MRS. SHADY

Why that shouldn't even be in there!

It's his rotten little half-brother.

(rips up photo)

Stinkin' little pecker... he never

was any good...

MRS. SHADY

(points at another)

Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi

boys. They were all so fussy and

persnickety about everything. Heil

this and heil that.

(flips the page)

Oh look... here's Max with his

chainsaw. He loved to go to the

national park and cut down those

giant old trees. It made him feel so

patriotic. You know, if he hadn't

been such a successful criminal... I

think he would have been a lumberjack.

MRS. SHADY

(tearful, angry)

But now he'll never be anything! Not

since...

(stands up, points)

...that woman, your wife, pulled the

trigger and put my little Max in his

grave!

JUDGE SKANKY

Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger

in my courtroom. It's discourteous,

impolite and disrespectful.

MRS. SHADY

Don't you tell me what to do with my

finger! It's been more places than

you've ever dreamed of!

JUDGE SKANKY

(bangs gavel)

Sit down!

MRS. SHADY

I'll point my finger wherever I want!

NED

Did you encounter the victim... Max

Shady... on board the train?

IRRITABLE MAN

Yeah. And I told him... "this is the

NO SMOKING car! Would you please put

out your damn cigar!"

NED

And is that the cigar in your ear?

IRRITABLE MAN

I believe it is.

NED

I'd like the cigar and the head of

this witness entered into evidence.

NED

The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

BAILIFF

Do you swear to tell the truth, the

whole truth and nothing but the truth

so help you God?

LANA

(looks to Judge)

Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

JUDGE SKANKY

No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

NED

Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you

Lana?

LANA

No. Call me Angel Tits.

PROSECUTOR

I object!

JUDGE SKANKY

Sustained. Counselor... you will

address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

NED

(after a beat)

Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell

the court... what were you doing on

that train?

LANA

I saw Max Shady at the station...

saw him get on board. I knew he'd

made threats to kill you and mutilate

your reproductive organs...

LANA

...so I got on the train too... so I

could warn you.

NED

Do you want to have children?

LANA

Someday. With the right man.

NED

But you couldn't have children if

my...

(makes a gesture)

...were...

(another gesture)

...and, uh...

LANA

It would be difficult.

NED

So you followed him, knowing you had

to protect me... your husband...

your best friend... the man you

love... the future father of your

children.

LANA

Something like that.

NED

And when you saw that maniac standing

in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize

my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and

fired and fired and FIRED!

LANA

And fired and fired and fired and

fired and fired and fired and fired...

LANA

...and fired and fired and fired.

NED

The defense rests, your Honor.

NED

How can you convict a courageous

woman who risked everything to save

the life of her beloved husband? A

woman who acted boldly to stop a

demented maniac from doing THIS!...

NED

(shouts over)

...pulverizing the private parts of

the man she loves!

NED

(directly to Jury)

Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the

potential mother of my potential

child. I challenge YOU to strike a

blow for motherhood and the American

justice system! Put the "con" back

in the Constitution. Put the "ju"

back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"

back in American. And put the "dom"

back in freedom. Find this woman

INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed

happy tonight!

REPORTER

The jury's back!

JUDGE SKANKY

(back to business)

So... has the jury reached a verdict?

JURY FOREMAN

(stands up)

Yes we have, your Honor.

JUDGE SKANKY

How do you find the defendant... on

the count of manslaughter?

JURY FOREMAN

Not guilty.

JUDGE SKANKY

On the count of murder in the first

degree?

JURY FOREMAN

Not guilty.

JUDGE SKANKY

On the Count of Monte Cristo?

JURY FOREMAN

Not guilty.

JUDGE SKANKY

Good. Then on the count of three,

let's all get the hell out of here!

One... two...

JUDGE SKANKY

Wait... for... it...

JUDGE SKANKY

Two and a half... THREE!

LANA

Well, counselor, looks like you won

another case. Lucky for me.

BAILIFF (O.S.)

(over P. A. system)

Attention courtroom shoppers! All

trial evidence now on sale. Forty to

sixty percent off all exhibits!

Everything must go!

IRRITABLE WOMAN

I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars

is bad for your hearing!

COURT CLERK

Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

LANA

How much for my gun?

LAURA

I don't believe it! She just bought

her gun back! The gun she used to

kill a man!

NED

Yeah... the same gun that saved my

life. I'm sure it has sentimental

value.

FRANK

So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

LANA

No thanks to you.

FRANK

Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

LANA

You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You

let me take all the heat.

FRANK

Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

LANA

You were gonna let me rot in the

slammer... never say a thing.

FRANK

Look... you're out... free. Now we're

together. That's what counts. We can

try again! Forget triple indemnity.

We'll whack him and split three mil.

LANA

I'm not splitting anything, Frank.

(cocks the gun)

And you know too much.

FRANK

(arrogant)

Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot

me.

LANA

You're right.

(then, seductive)

Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

FRANK

Now you're talkin' baby.

FORENSIC MAN

Watch your step, guys. There's a lot

of blood.

INVESTIGATOR

Looks like a suicide. We found a

note.

INVESTIGATOR

It was stuck up his nose.

ARCH

(reading it)

"I can't take it anymore. I'm a

mediocre mechanic... and a lousy

lover."

NED

He's sure got that right.

NED

The "mechanic" part, I mean.

NED

(stares at the body)

I don't know why, Arch, but I just

can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't

suicide.

LANA

Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

NED

(nervous, defensive)

Um? She told you her name was Um?

And what other lies did she tell

you? I've never seen this woman in

my life! Never followed her home!

Never had sex with her in the

refrigerator! It's all a sick

fantasy... and I deny everything!

NED

When will women like you learn, you

can't tear apart a perfectly good

marriage with your vicious lies...

Miss UMMMM!

LOLA

Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.

I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.

The big powerful kind that suck up

everything in sight. I was just

telling your wife, if she wants to

get rid of all her dirt, she has to

be willing to pay the price.

LOLA

Let me know what you decide, Mrs.

Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a

convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure

meeting you... Ned.

LANA

I... hate... SALESMEN!

NED

I know it's been a tough ordeal...

with the trial and everything. Tell

you what... let's take a trip.

LANA

A trip?

NED

Yeah. Just the two of us.

LANA

(darkly inspired)

I like that. Just you and me... all

alone. I'll start packing.

NED

Great. Listen... I got something to

take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

LOLA

Who is it?

NED

I just want to talk.

LOLA

Why didn't you say so?

LOLA

Would you like a drink?

NED

No thanks. I'm driving.

LOLA

Then let's get to the point!

LOLA

So what's your problem, tough guy?

NED

Stay away from my life, my wife, my

home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on

a vacation and when I come back, I

don't ever want to see your face

again!

LOLA

(shocked)

A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a

VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!

She always was and always will be!

NED

What are you talking about? You don't

know anything about Lana?

LOLA

I know EVERYTHING!

NED

(shakes her hard)

How do you know her? Who is she to

you? TELL ME!

NED

Who is she!

LOLA

She's your wife!

NED

(slaps her again!)

Who is she!?

LOLA

She's my sister!

NED

(slaps her again)

Liar! Who is she?

LOLA

She's your wife!

NED

WHO IS SHE!

LOLA

She's my sister!

LOLA

She's your wife... AND my sister!

LOLA

She was spoiled rotten! She stole

everything I ever had. Everything!

Including him.

NED

Him? Who, him?

LOLA

Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He

was older. So mature... so strong.

He smelled like dirty sweat socks

and old basketballs. And he was all

mine. For awhile.

(turning bitter)

But Lana wasn't satisfied with her

own things. She had to have mine

too. She took it all... my makeup,

my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

NED

You wore the same clothes?

LOLA

We were identical twins.

NED

What're you talking about? You two

don't look anything alike.

LOLA

Not anymore. One day I caught her

stealing my lavender eye shadow and

she smashed my face in with a shovel.

I had fifty-three operations. When

the doctors were finished with me...

I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

NED

You're beautiful.

LOLA

Don't lie to me.

NED

They did a terrific job!

LOLA

I look in the mirror. I can SEE!

NED

But... you're gorgeous!

LOLA

Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my

face, he left me for HER... because

she looked more like me than I did!

First she stole my looks... then she

stole the only man who ever loved

me!

LOLA

But I found a way to get even. The

best revenge possible. Destroy her

marriage!

NED

That's why you did all this? Seduced

me... harrassed me... the tape...

the flowers... the phone calls...

LOLA

You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,

haven't ya?

NED

It won't work. Lana loves me.

LOLA

It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing

her for everything she's worth. She

murdered that greasy auto mechanic.

I saw her do it.

NED

(stunned)

Lana killed Frank Kelbo?

LOLA

(also stunned)

Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?

NED

Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car

repairs too?

LOLA

Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a

son. Frankie Kelbo.

NED (V.O.)

The pieces of the puzzle were falling

into place and I didn't like the

picture they were making. If Lana

really killed Frank Kelbo, then I

had misjudged her by a mile. Sure...

he was a lousy mechanic. But murder?

NED (V.O.)

It was all starting to give me a

headache bigger than the national

deficit.

NED

Lana?

LAURA

Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so

much to tell you.

NED

Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab

a chair.

LAURA

Thanks... I brought my own.

NED

So... what have you got?

LAURA

A lottery ticket and a laundry

receipt.

(lays them on table)

I found them in the pocket of that

suit you wore the night you were

working under cover with a client.

LAURA

You remember that night, don't ya

Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts

with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-

O... L-A. Lola.

LAURA

(shrugs it off)

Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's

mind works.

NED

How about Ovaltine?

LAURA

Fine. Then I remembered you told me

some guy named Frank had been working

on your wife's car for two months.

You with me so far?

NED

I'm way ahead of you.

LAURA

Well back it up. You probably took a

wrong turn. Remember your insurance

policy... the one we couldn't find?

I started thinking, who else had

access to it beside you and me? The

answer came up... Lana. And since

she's a woman, it's probably hidden

right here.

NED

So that's where she hid the Oreos.

LAURA

Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your

life when she shot Max Shady. She

and Frank were plotting to kill you

and collect on your insurance policy.

But she shot the wrong guy.

NED

That's the craziest thing I ever

heard.

LAURA

(she presses on)

Don't you see... Frank was going to

let her take the fall. So she murdered

him and tried to make it look like

suicide.

(beat)

That's when I realized there was a

connection between Lola and Lana...

NED

Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

LAURA

Well, hang on to your jock strap,

Ned. There's more.

LAURA

Not only is Frank's father Dwayne

Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher

and Lola Cain's former lover...

Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max

and Frank are half-brothers who never

met.

LAURA

Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered

both of Helen Shady's sons.

NED

This is so unbelievable.

LAURA

And you haven't even heard my story.

LAURA

He turned into a monster. And that's

when I left him. I just couldn't...

NED

That damn faucet keeps turning on

all by itself. I'll go check it.

LAURA

Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

GUEST MUSICIAN

I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a

gig tonight.

NED

(ECHOING V.O.)

Women are an open book. You can always

tell the rotten apples from the

peaches. I'd stake my career on it...

stake my career on it... stake my

career on it...

NED

(ECHOING V.O.)

...If anyone ever proves me wrong,

I'll throw away my badge.

LAURA'S HUSBAND

Forget something, sweetheart?

LAURA'S HUSBAND

You forgot to flush, darling.

LOLA

What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me

away?

LAURA

I never forget anything... honey.

LAURA

(outraged)

Those are MY panties!

LAURA

Oh Ned!

NED

You were right... there's a million

things I don't know about women.

Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

NED

Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

LAURA

Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved

you!

LAURA

Got 'em!

NED

(deafened)

WHAT?

LAURA

I said... I GOT 'EM!

NED

HUH?!!!

LAURA

(yells)

THEY'RE DEAD! GONE! KA-PUT!

NED

(yells back)

SURE I'LL MARRY YOU! NEXT TUESDAY

WOULD BE PERFECT!

LAURA

Okay. But I want to have kids.

NED

Great.

NED (V.O.)

So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women

really are like a big jigsaw puzzle...

with pieces that never seem to fit

where you want 'em to.

NED (V.O.)

All I know is, there are three things

that men can't possibly ever do...

NED

...understand women... give birth...

and program a VCR. And giving birth

is the easy one.

LAURA

Ned...

NED

Yeah, Laura?

LAURA

Knock off the chatter, will ya?

LAURA

We won't need you anymore.

LAURA

We can make our own music.

LAURA (V.O.)

Ned, do you know... I want you to

make love to me all night long?

NED (V.O.)

No. But if you hum a few bars...

I'll fake it.

THE END
