Bamboozled

by

Spike Lee

MALCOLM X (V.O.)

You've been hoodwinked.  You've

been had.  You've been took.

You've been led astray, run amok.

You've been bamboozled.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Satire.  1a.  A literary work in

which human vice or folly is

ridiculed or attacked scornfully.

B.  The branch of literature that

composes such work.  2.  Irony,

derision or caustic wit used to

attack or expose folly, vice or

stupidity.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Bonjour, my name is Pierre Delacroix.

I'm a television writer, also a

showrunner, a creative person.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I'm one of those people responsible

for what you view on your idiot box.

2.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The problem is not enough of you

have been watching.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

With the onslaught of the internet,

video and interactive games, nine

hundred channels to choose from and

whatnot, our valued audience has

dramatically eroded.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

To put it in much more simple

terms...

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Like rats fleeing a sinking ship.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

People tuning out by the millions.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Which is not good.

3.

CHEEBA

Yo, let's get to it.  You don't

dance, we don't eat.  Simple as that.

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

That's right.  We slow.  We blow.

We snooze.  We lose.

CHEEBA

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

I know everybody is in a hurry to

work, ready to begin another day in

this rat race.  But don't sleep us.

I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you

the world renown MANRAY, the man

with the educated feet.

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

As we continue our world wind tour,

we would like to give you a little

somethin', somethin' before you go

off to make that money.  I give you

Manray.

4.

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

Thank you very much but please

don't go without giving us some

cheddar, cheese, money.  We prefer

two's than fews.

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

I would like to add that both of us

are homeless.  Not that it means

anything.

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

I said homeless.  Ladies and

gentlemen.  Senorita, do you know

what that means?

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

Muchos gracias.

DELACROIX

Good morning, Cheeba.

CHEEBA

Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.

DELACROIX

De-la-croix.

CHEEBA

Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet

for Manray and I yet?

5.

DELACROIX

Not yet.

CHEEBA

Gracias.

DELACROIX

Manray, Sloan says you're too

talented to be dancing on the street.

MANRAY

Well do something about it.

DELACROIX

Good morning, Marie.

MARIE

It's not gonna be a good morning

for you if you don't get into

Dunwitty's staff meeting.

DELACROIX

What staff meeting?

MARIE

The staff meeting that started 30

minutes ago.

6.

DUNWITTY

Monsieur Delacroix, this very

important meeting commenced...

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.

DUNWITTY

I'm sorry I'm late.

DUNWITTY

Do you know how much information

can be dispensed in one minute alone?

DELACROIX

I didn't find out about this very

important staff meeting until...

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Four minutes ago.

DUNWITTY

So are you telling me everyone knew

about this get-together except you?

DELACROIX

I wasn't told about this until

Marie informed me as soon as I got

off the elevator.

DUNWITTY

People, you can attempt to pull a

Rodman like our friend Delacroix,

but I guarantee you'll be sent

packing just like him.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

These are the standings.  Read 'em

and weep.  As you can plainly see

the Continental Network System is

languishing.

7.

DUNWITTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Look at 'em people.  We are BOOTY,

CA CA.  We are DOO-DOO.  Doo-doo on

a stick, if you will.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

I do not like to be the laughing

stock of the broadcast industry.  I

have pride and people, you better

start getting some too.  These

numbers have to go up.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

Question?

JOAN

So what do you want us to do?

DUNWITTY

What I want everyone to do is write

some material that is FUNNY.  The

junk you've been writing is about

as funny as a dead baby.  It's not

funny, it's not new.  It's not sexy.

It, it, it...

FISH

Sucks.

DUNWITTY

SUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This

meeting is over but I want everyone

to seriously think about what I

said and how you can deliver.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now.

8.

SLOAN

How was it?

DELACROIX

Why didn't you tell me about this

staff meeting?

SLOAN

Nobody told me anything.

DELACROIX

What good are you if you don't tell

me stuff like this?

SLOAN

It wasn't my fault.  If I would

have known, I would have known.

DUNWITTY

Do you know what C.P. Time is?

DELACROIX

C.P. Time is Colored People's Time.

The stereotypical belief that

Negroes are always late.  That

Negroes have no sense of time -

time except when it comes to music

or dance.

DUNWITTY

Let's sit down over there.

9.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry about my blowup but I

have to have a whipping boy every

meeting.

DELACROIX

I understand.  But again, in all

honesty I was not informed.

DUNWITTY

Forget it.  I believe you're my

most creative person I've got on

staff.  You're hip.  You know

what's happening.  I got some corny

white boys and girls writing for me.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

I understand Black culture.  I grew

up around black people all my life.

If the truth be told I probably

know "niggers" better than you,

Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't

get offended by my use of the

quote-unquote N word.  I got a

black wife and three bi-racial

children, so I feel I have a right

to use that word.  I don't give a

damn what Spike says, Tarantino is

right.  Nigger is just a word.  If

Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every

other word so can I.

DELACROIX

I would prefer you not use that

word in my presence.

DUNWITTY

NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

DELACROIX

Say it again.  C'mon, say it again.

10.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Who's a nigger now?

DUNWITTY

The material you've been creating

is too white bread.  White people

with black faces.  The Huxtable's,

Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's

dead.  We can't go down that road

again.

DELACROIX

I don't agree.  The Negro middle

class does exist, and it's rich

material for a dramatic series or

sitcom.

DUNWITTY

I'm telling you it's not.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

The middle class black family moves

into a white suburban enclave.  The

middle class black family moves

into a small Southern town that is

run by the KKK.  The middle class

single black father raises his

teenage daughter.  The middle class

single black father raises his

teenage daughter.  The middle class

single black mother raises her

teenage son.  And so on and so

forth.  It's too clean, too

antiseptic...

DELACROIX

...to white?  I still feel all of

my scripts would make good shows.

11.

DUNWITTY

Delacroix, wake up, brother man.

The reason why they didn't get

picked up was because nobody - and

I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers

alike wants to see that junk.

DELACROIX

I've never been given a fair shot.

DUNWITTY

You got your head stuck up your ass

with your Harvard education and

your pretentious ways.  Brother

man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm

keepin' it real and you're frontin',

trying to be white.

DELACROIX

I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I

don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM

OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF

DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as

you might put it, some "nigger"

show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than

white and you're blacker than black?

Is that what you think?

DUNWITTY

That's exactly what I think.  I

want you to create something that

people want to see.  Let's be

honest, the majority of the people

in the country are deaf, dumb and

blind and I'm including 35 million

African-Americans.  You know and I

know "niggers" set the trend, set

the styles.  This is a golden

opportunity now.  These idiots have

to be led to the water.

DELACROIX

I'm not sure if I can deliver what

you want.

DUNWITTY

You will or you'll be back at BET

so quick you'll never know what hit

you.  I need a mid-season

replacement and pronto.  It will be

on the fast track.

12.

DELACROIX

What is it you want from me?  Some

plantation follies?  Some sitcom

that takes place on a watermelon

patch?  Some show that follows four

nigger generations of junkies and

crackheads?  You want me to go back

to the ante bellum days?

DUNWITTY

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show

that will make headlines, that will

have millions and millions of

households tuned in, glued to their

televisions every week.  I want

advertisers dying to buy on this

show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show

out of you if it kills you.

MANRAY

I'm starvin' like Marvin.

CHEEBA

My world famous, famous world Arroz

con pollo will be ready very soon.

MANRAY

Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.

CHEEBA

Did we get our bill yet?

MANRAY

I guess that will come with the

rent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too.

13.

CHEEBA

Ahh, the luxuries of life.

MANRAY

Yo, check it.  This is good and all

that but one day soon I want to

have much Benjamins so I can have a

nice crib and pay all my bills.

You hear me.

CHEEBA

Chill, I'm the brains behind this

outfit.

MANRAY

And I'm the feet.

CHEEBA

Yo, you gotta show some patience.

You want me to snap my fingers and

presto chango - you're an overnight

sensation.  Son, there is no such

thing.

MANRAY

I'm tired of waiting.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

I was never good at performing

under the gun.

14.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Well, this wasn't a gun, it was a

bazooka and it was pressed dead

blank right against my dome.

15.

CHEEBA

Oh snap!  It's a raid!

POLICE CHIEF

Please evacuate this building.  All

of you are illegal residents of

this condemned building.  Please

leave immediately, by order of the

Mayor of New York City, Rudolph

Giuliani.

16.

CHEEBA

Not this way.  Out through the fire

escape.

MANRAY

My tap shoes.

DELACROIX

EUREKA!!

SLOAN

Oh my God!!!

DELACROIX

Manray!

SLOAN

Manray!

17.

DELACROIX

How did you know?

SLOAN

It hit me like a ton of bricks.

DELACROIX

How can this be?  You and me at the

same time, the exact same thought.

It's scary.

SLOAN

The idea was out there in the

universe.  Now what?

MANRAY

We ran out without my shoes and the

floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What

about our savings?

CHEEBA

Are you crazy?  The joint is

crawling with cops now.  You wanna

go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

DELACROIX

Manray was under our nose the whole

time.

SLOAN

Do you know how you will use him?

DELACROIX

Not yet, but this thing will never

get made.

18.

SLOAN

You lost me.

DELACROIX

Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And

that's what I'm going to give him,

it's going to be so racist, so

negative, he won't have the balls

to put it on the air.  Hence I'll

prove my point.

SLOAN

What point is that?

DELACROIX

The point being that him, the

networks don't want Black people on

television unless they are buffoons.

SLOAN

Sounds risky to me.

DELACROIX

You getting cold feet?

SLOAN

I'm in till the end.

DELACROIX

Good.  I'm going to need your

support.

SLOAN

Can't you just quit?  Walk away?

DELACROIX

And lose out on my money?  The only

way I get paid is if I get fired.

And that's what I intend to do.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Everything was going according to

plan.  I was working on the outline.

Dunwitty was off my back for now.

19.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But there was a catch.  A big catch.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to

be found.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

It was like they had disappeared

off the face of the earth.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I had no contact numbers, no

address, no beeper.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

No nuthin', no clues...

SLOAN

Maybe something happened to them.

Maybe they're lying in an alley

bleed to death.

DELACROIX

Manray better not be bleeding to

death.  I need him.  After we're

done he can do whatever he wants to

do, until then, he's ours.

20.

SLOAN

You're beginning to sound like

Dunwitty.

CHEEBA

His name is Delapoint.

SECURITY GUARD #1

WE have no one by that name.

CHEEBA

Delapot.  Dela-something.

SECURITY GUARD #2

De La Soul ain't here either.

Let's go.  Out.  Off the premises.

MANRAY

Sloan!  She knows us.

SLOAN

It's alright.  They are associates

of Mr. Delacroix.

SECURITY GUARD #1

Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.  They both

walked in off the street without an

appointment.

SECURITY GUARD #2

Do you need an escort?

SLOAN

That won't be needed.

21.

DELACROIX

Eureka!  Where've you been?

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Sloan and I have been looking all

over for you.

CHEEBA

You'd take no offense if we called

you DeLa for short?

DELACROIX

No offense.

CHEEBA

Manray needs a job.

MANRAY

We got evicted from our home.

We've both been on the streets for

the last week.

CHEEBA

We was coming to see you.

MANRAY

If it's not too much trouble could

you order us some food?

CHEEBA

We're starving.

DELACROIX

I apologize.  What would you like

to eat?  Anything you want.

22.

DELACROIX

I have this concept for a TV pilot.

There's no guarantee it will get

made but regardless, you'll still

make some money.

CHEEBA

How much?

DELACROIX

First things first.  I have to know

if Manray is up for this.

MANRAY

What do I have to do?

DELACROIX

Some tap dancing, some singing.

MANRAY

Where do I sign?

CHEEBA

What kind of show is this gonna be?

DELACROIX

Different.

MANRAY

How different?

DELACROIX

Trust me.  Of course I still have

to pitch it to my boss, but we'll

have an answer one way or the other.

MANRAY

DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get

to hoof and get paid too!!!

DELACROIX

That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

CHEEBA

What about in the mean time?  Not

the in between time?

DELACROIX

You'll both get an advance and you

can stay with me.

MANRAY

Bet.

23.

DELACROIX

I would like to change your name.

MANRAY

To what?

DELACROIX

You're now Mantan.

MANRAY

Mantan?  I don't even care as long

as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me,

I need some new kicks.

MANRAY

I never had a really real pair

before.

SLOAN

You've never had any formal

training, either?

MANRAY

Not a class, not a thing, just

picked stuff up by myself.

SLOAN

I wish I had your natural talent.

God only makes that visit once in a

while.

MANRAY

You sing and dance?

SLOAN

A little.  I just graduated from

NYU film school.  Cinema studies.

MANRAY

So what's up with you and DeLa?

SLOAN

What do you mean?

MANRAY

Are you and him kicking it?

Knocking boots.

Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

24.

SLOAN

No, we're not knocking boots.  I

got this internship while I still

was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with

my get up and go and hired me to be

his assistant.

MANRAY

I'm sure that was the only thing he

was impressed with.  You look

beautiful like that.

SLOAN

If that was suppose to be a

compliment, I thank you.

MANRAY

You're welcome.  You shouldn't give

up on performing.

SLOAN

Why do you say that?  You've never

seen me.

MANRAY

I think that would probably make

you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing,

I mean really doing my thing,

hitting it, nothing compares to

that feeling in the world.

SLOAN

I envy you.  That's the way I want

to feel about my work.

25.

BIG BLACK

Li'l Sister.

SLOAN

You idiot.  You almost gave me a

massive coronary.

BIG BLACK

I didn't mean to scare you like that.

SLOAN

Well you did.

BIG BLACK

Give me some?

SLOAN

I'm not huggin' you in the middle

of the street.  You must be crazy,

Julius.

BIG BLACK

Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done

told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't

my name, you better recognize

Hopkins was our slave name.  My

true name is...

SLOAN

I'm not callin you Big Black Africa.

Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.

BIG BLACK

BIG BLACK is the first name and

AFRICA is the last.

BIG BLACK

Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food

up in here in dis' piece.

SLOAN

I order out mostly.  So what do I

owe this visit to?

26.

BIG BLACK

My group we need some exposure.

Was wondering if you could hook a

brother up?

SLOAN

Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You

must be smoking.  Why in the world

would I want to hook up a bunch of

red, black and green flag-waving

pseudo revolutionairies?

BIG BLACK

So now I see where you're coming

from.  Just because we ain't

rapping about Gucci, Timberland,

Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and

bitches, we're pseudo.

SLOAN

Who are you revolting against?

BIG BLACK

We're revolting against the powers

that be, that been enslaving the

minds and hearts of all people of

color.  And we won't stop rapping

till we bring about the overthrow

of the government of the U.S. of A.

SLOAN

Please.

BIG BLACK

If you were really down you would

get us together with that boss of

yours.  What's his name again?

SLOAN

Delacroix.

BIG BLACK

Yeah, him.

SLOAN

What makes you think he would write

a show about the Mau-Mau's.

BIG BLACK

C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a

show.  Look at all that other junk

that's on TV.  We got underground

cult following.

27.

SLOAN

You don't have the demographics.

BIG BLACK

So are you telling me that you

wouldn't even introduce me to

Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm

talking 'bout me, your only brother,

ya own flesh and blood, hook a

brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.

SLOAN

That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not

blowin' my young career, brother or

no brother, for you or anybody else.

BIG BLACK

There is a name, a term for your

kind, the likes of you.  Back in

slavery days, you would be

classified as a house nigga.

SLOAN

If you think I'm a house nigga then

that's your prerogative.  You got

your ways to affect change, I have

mine.  And I would appreciate it

very much if you took ya field

nigga ass out of my house.

BIG BLACK

My own sister throwin' me out.  I

hope to seeya later when you get ya

mind right.  Don't bother letting

me out.

SLOAN

That's mighty black of you.

DUNWITTY

Delacroix, I'm glad you got your

mind right.

DELACROIX

It's right and tight.  Good morning,

let me introduce you to everybody.

You know my assistant, Sloan.

28.

SLOAN

Hello.

DELACROIX

This is Cheeba.

CHEEBA

Nice to meet you.

DELACROIX

And this is Manray.

MANRAY

How do you do?

DUNWITTY

Good.  I like the names.  Very

theatrical.

DELACROIX

We're all happy to be here and I'm

going to paint a picture for you.

DUNWITTY

I'm wid it.

DELACROIX

I've done a lot of soul searching

and once again you are right.  In

my previous work it's been all

surface, superficial.  I have never

really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As

Mark Twain fully understood satire

is the way.  Race has always been a

hot button in this country's

history and it needs to be pushed

harder.  If we are ever to live

side by side in peace and harmony.

It's about promoting racial healing.

DUNWITTY

Go on.  Good so far.

DELACROIX

I know you're familiar with minstrel

shows.  They came about at the turn

of the 19th century.  It was a

variety show in which the talent

was in blackface - singing, dancing,

telling jokes, doing skits.

Dunwitty, I ask you when was the

last time there was a good variety

show on the air.  Carol Burnett?

HeeHaw?

29.

DUNWITTY

Word!!!

DELACROIX

So let's take this great form, this

very American tradition of

entertainment into the 21st century,

into the new millennium.

DUNWITTY

The name of the show?

DELACROIX

It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW

MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

DUNWITTY

I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?

Because I'm getting a boner, my

Johnson is hard, no disrespect my

sister.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

I'm feelin' dis'!

DELACROIX

It will take a lot of courage and

backbone on the part of the CNS to

get this on the air.  In fact, I

would understand fully if the

subject matter is deemed too

risque, too controversial.

DUNWITTY

Don't worry about that, that's my

department.  Now who do we cast?

We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or

dance?

DELACROIX

I don't know if Whoopi is the way

to go.

DUNWITTY

Are these our two stars, sitting

here in front of my nose?  Which

one is Mantan again?

MANTAN

That's me.

30.

DELACROIX

And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.

DUNWITTY

That's a great handle.

DELACROIX

Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real

coons.  I know we're way out there

but it's satire.

DUNWITTY

I want you take it there.  All the

way to the edge and back.

DELACROIX

Every week we follow the trials and

tribulations of two real coons -

Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky

Duo.

DUNWITTY

What are there character traits?

DELACROIX

Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and

unlucky.

DUNWITTY

Exactly!

DELACROIX

Mantan is an uneducated Negro who

always by some stroke of

unbelievable stupidity makes his

best laid plans go haywire.

DUNWITTY

And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical

sidekick?

DELACROIX

Yep, you guessed it.

DUNWITTY

This could be bigger than "Amos and

Andy."

31.

DELACROIX

Protest finally forced "Amos and

Andy" off the air.  Could stop us

from ever getting on.

DUNWITTY

Let'em try.  I will kill to make

this happen.

DELACROIX

Negroes would be in an uproar.

DUNWITTY

So what.  We would just give the

NAACP a donation that would be the

end of that.  No such thing as bad

publicity.  So what.  Earlier you

said singing and dancing.

DELACROIX

Mantan right here is a gifted

hoofer.  He has educated feet.

DUNWITTY

Who are the other characters?

DELACROIX

Do we have characters?  How about

Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus,

Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny,

and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

DUNWITTY

We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY

on dis' one.  What's the setting?

DELACROIX

In the projects.  Like Eddie

Murphy's "The PJ's."

DUNWITTY

Ya first bad move.  Projects been

done.  That's one of the problems

now, everything, movies, TV, are

set in the urban jungle, da hood.

That's so tired.  Mantan's

Millennium Minstrel Show should be

set on a plantation.  In Alabama.

(MORE)

32.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

And every week these Alabama porch

monkeys will make us cry, make us

laugh, make us look at our own

humanity.  Make us feel good to be

alive.

DELACROIX

I don't know about that plantation

angle.

DUNWITTY

What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's

the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're

movin' fast.  What does everybody

else think about this?

SLOAN

We'd get a lot of mail.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be

another show like it.

CHEEBA

I've always wanted to be on

television.

DUNWITTY

I like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's

funny.  Mantan, how do you feel

about performing in black face?

MANTAN

As long as the hoofing is real,

that I can do my thing, I can

blacken up.  Let me hit it, beats

and rhythms, express myself.

DUNWITTY

Show me a little somethin' somethin'.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper

than deep.

33.

MANTAN

I'm gonna give you just a taste.

My tap shoes are brand new.  I

haven't trained 'em yet.

MANTAN (CONT'D)

Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats,

beats, beats.  No Fred Astaire

here, baby.  Just rawness.

DUNWITTY

That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout.

That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's

off the hiz-hook!

DELACROIX

We think so.

DUNWITTY

Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?

CHEEBA

I play the straight man.  I do some

singing and dancing also.  I also

manage Mantan.

DUNWITTY

Oh you do so?

CHEEBA

I'm the man behind the man behind

the man.

DUNWITTY

You da man.

34.

CHEEBA

No, you da man.

DUNWITTY

I'm gonna run upstairs with this.

If CNS doesn't want to do this,

somebody else will have da balls to

pull the trigger.  I want to thank

each and every one of you.  This is

great, Delacroix.  I'll get back to

you later today.

CHEEBA

Life is beginning to look up.  It's

all good in da neighborhood.

MANTAN

You might be right.

CHEEBA

Why are you smiling so?

MANTAN

I'm not smiling.

CHEEBA

Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That

hottie Sloan Hopkins.

MANTAN

It's that bad, huh?  It's all over

my face.

CHEEBA

No shame in ya game.  She got ya

nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open.

Sloan's what we certified ladies'

men call low hanging fruit.

MANTAN

Certified ladies' man, huh?

CHEEBA

She's also moorish.

35.

MANTAN

What's that?

CHEEBA

Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of

dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

MANTAN

Seconds and thirds, too.

CHEEBA

Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm

a tri-sexual.

MANTAN

You'd try anything.  I got first

dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

CHEEBA

Naw, just jokin'.  That's you.

That's you.

DELACROIX

I want you to start using the name

Mantan and not Manray if you don't

mind.

MANRAY

Why?

DELACROIX

You have to start getting into your

character.

CHEEBA

At the risk of sounding ignorant...

CHEEBA (CONT'D)

...don't say a word but who is this

cat Mantan you keep talkin' 'bout?

36.

DELACROIX (O.S.)

This is Mantan Moreland.

DELACROIX (O.S.) (CONT'D)

He was a clown, a buffoon but he

was funny.

CHEEBA

That ain't funny.

MANRAY

DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

DELACROIX

Gentlemen, the show, our show will

be satirical.  You know what that

is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

CHEEBA

We might need some mo' money behind

this.

DELACROIX

That can be done.

MANRAY

Mantan?

DELACROIX

Mantan!!

37.

1/16TH BLACK

Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for

this joint.

BIG BLACK

How 'bout...

BIG BLACK (CONT'D)

Black Iz Black?

DOUBLE BLACK

That's da bomb.

MO BLACK

That's gonna give me some

inspiration.

JO BLACK

Gonna make me get my flow on.

BIG BLACK

We should call dis da BLACK album.

SMOOTH BLACK

Yo, check it out.  We have never

conformed to none of the white

man's rules and regulations and

later for that ole slave owner

Webster.  Therefore I respectfully

submit BIG BLACK that we from now

on, hence forth and whatnot spell

BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.

HARD BLACK

I feel dat.

1/16TH BLACK

B-L-A-K.  BLAK.  The darkest of all

colors, the opposite of white.  A

member of an African people.  But

check it out, here's where the grey

people try to get slick with their

trickery.  Listen to the full

connotations.  GLOOMY.  DEPRESSING.

EVIL.  WICKED.  ANGRY.  SULLEN.

(MORE)

38.

1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)

BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL.

Need I say more.

BIG BLACK

B-L-A-K it is.

ORCHID

You must think I'm some kind of fool.

DELACROIX

It looks delicious.

ORCHID

You hear me talkin' to you.  The

only time you come up here when

something is wrong.

DELACROIX

C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that

I'm an ungrateful son stuff.

ORCHID

I said no such thing.  All I said

is that something must be wrong.

ORCHID (CONT'D)

How's the food?

DELACROIX

Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well,

since you asked, it looks like I

may have a new show, a pilot being

shot.

ORCHID

That's wonderful.  Isn't that what

you always wanted, a show of your

own?

39.

DELACROIX

It was.  It is.  But this is a

different kind of show.

ORCHID

If at first it's not what you want,

just work that much harder, Peerless.

DELACROIX

Mommy, please don't call me that.

ORCHID

Son, Peerless is your name.  Now

you might be one of these Hollywood

types, change your name and all

that but Peerless Dothan is on your

birth certificate.

DELACROIX

I know what's on my birth

certificate.  You heard from Daddy?

ORCHID

I guess he's still on the road.

What kind of show is this?  Are

they some Negroes in it without

being buffoons?

DELACROIX

To answer your question, there are

a lot of Negroes in it and what is

your definition of buffoons?

ORCHID

Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.

We have enough of those on

television already.

DELACROIX

Please let me know when you hear

from Daddy, get a number or

something.

ORCHID

I will.  And good luck with your

show.  I hope it's a huge success.

You've worked very hard.  You

deserve it.

40.

SLOAN

You okay?

DELACROIX

I feel like somebody hit me upside

da head with a sledgehammer.

CHEEBA

DeLa - what's the matter with you.

MANTAN

You ain't happy about the green

light?

SLOAN

People show their happiness in a

lot of different ways.

MANTAN

Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a

funeral.

DELACROIX

I'm happy for all of us.  It's just

we have a great responsibility now.

The pressure is on.

MANTAN

Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know

what the hell real pressure is.

SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff.

Now when you scramblin' out on the

street in da January winter and the

hawk is talkin' to you with NO

money and NO prospects of money

anytime soon, now that there is

some pressure.

DELACROIX

I didn't mean it to sound like that.

41.

MANTAN

That's the way it came out.  Let me

ask you one question.  Have you

ever been in want, in need your

entire privileged life?

DELACROIX

Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because

I didn't grow up on food stamps and

welfare?  Because I didn't call

home a cardboard box?  No, I never

ever went to bed hungry and I'm

proud of it, too.  Whoever told you

that living in poverty earns you

somekind of badge of honor flat out

lied to you.

MANTAN

The point I'm trying to make is

that this is a blessing.  It's

going to be fun doing this show and

we should all look at it that way.

CHEEBA

What's wrong with him?

MANTAN

Must be the pressure.

JESSICA

Sorry I'm late.

SLOAN

Hey, girl.  This is my best friend,

Jessica Grillo.  I invited her down

to celebrate with us.

CHEEBA

I'm Cheeba.

MANTAN

I'm Mantan.

42.

CHEEBA

Please, have a seat.

MANTAN

Sloan never told us she had friends

like you.

CHEEBA

In fact, we never knew she had any

friends period.

SLOAN

Later for you.

JESSICA

She has a lot of friends

CHEEBA

Male?

JESSICA

Yes.

MANTAN

A lot?

SLOAN

Enough.

JESSICA

I propose a toast.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

To the success of your show.  Good

luck.

SLOAN

Excuse me.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Wait here.

43.

SLOAN

What is your problem?

DELACROIX

My problem is MANTAN THE NEW

MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

SLOAN

Why did you even come up with that

shit if you didn't want it made?

DELACROIX

It was the principle.  Dunwitty had

to be enlightened.  I was making a

point.  I take pride in my work.

Plus, I already told you I wasn't

gonna walk away from my money.

SLOAN

Fuck da money.  Why do through all

this effort?  Why?  Are you looking

for love from Dunwitty?  For

respect?  Dunwitty and his likes

don't give a goddamn about you.  So

now what are you gonna do?

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Will you please let me in?  I have

to use the toilet.

SLOAN

You're gonna have to hold it in

because we're not finished yet...

SLOAN (CONT'D)

...QUIT then.

44.

DELACROIX

Even if money wasn't an issue,

Dunwitty will still go ahead

without me and that could be more

dangerous.

SLOAN

What's the chances of MANTAN being

picked up?

DELACROIX

I wouldn't bet against it.  My

Negroidal ass is stuck between the

proverbial rock and a hard place.

SLOAN

Like I said, all this for some

twisted, distorted sense of

principal.  Dunwitty, he just

tolerates your Negroidal ass, he

doesn't respect it.

MANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.)

Please open this bathroom door

immediately.  You are being very

inconsiderate.

DELACROIX

I strongly feel that a Negro should

direct this.  This kind of satire

is a high wire act in a gale storm.

One misstep and we're doing "Amos

and Andy."  Only a Negro will have

the sensitivity and cultural

awareness to navigate this dangerous

terrain.

DUNWITTY

To hire someone solely on their

ethnicity, gender or religion is

not right.  It's un-American.  I

will hire someone who is most

qualified for this particular job.

45.

DELACROIX

I was hoping to perhaps direct some

episodes myself, if not the pilot

soon after.

DUNWITTY

I want a hot, young white director.

Maybe the kid, that pheenom who

just did that hot new sexy Madonna

video.

DELACROIX

You're telling me some white boy is

gonna direct this pilot?

DUNWITTY

I just want you to meet him.  Keep

an open mind.

DELACROIX

Besides, what does he know about

Negroes?

DUNWITTY

Probably nuthin', but that's why

it's such a sexy way to go.

Sometimes an outsider has a fresh

new outlook, a different unique

perspective.  A black director,

y'know what he's gonna do given the

subject matter?  With this kid, the

possibilities are endless.

DELACROIX

What are his qualifications besides

being a white male and directing a

hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

DUNWITTY

If Spielburg can direct "The Color

Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid

can direct the Mantan pilot.

DELACROIX

That's exactly my point.  Has he

even directed actors before in

anything?

DUNWITTY

No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's

all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even

let you choose your own musical

director.  You can have that.

46.

DELACROIX

In the immortal words of Derrick

Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!

DUNWITTY

Derrick Coleman, he possessed all

the talent in the world, coulda,

shoulda, been a great ballplayer

but alas D.C. didn't want it bad

enough.  Delacroix, do you want it?

Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you

want it that much.

DELACROIX

Good morning, for those of you who

don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix.

I'm running things and this here is

my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

SLOAN

Hello.

DELACROIX

I've never worked with any of you

and you've never worked with me so

we'll be starting from scratch.

I'm a fair person, a straight

shooter and I don't hold my tongue.

Everybody up in here should know I

had nothing to do with you being

hired.

(MORE)

47.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

I would have preferred at least one

other Negro writer.  Any questions?

Comments?

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Yes, your name?

MONA

He, I'm Mona.

DELACROIX

Hi, Mona.

MONA

I perfectly understand where you're

coming from.  As a minority I can

relate to your struggle also.  But

I think you should give us all a

chance.  We want this pilot to be

successful just as much as you.

Please don't be so quick to judge

us based only on our whiteness.

DELACROIX

Oh, is that what I'm doing?

BETH

I think because of our background

we can bring a unique perspective

to Mantan.

SETH

A fresh pair of eyes.  A new look,

insight, new angle that hasn't been

seen before.

DELACROIX

I've heard this somewhere before.

48.

DAVID

My name is David.  I do think it

would be better to have some

African-American writers but for

whatever reason they are not here.

I don't know if they couldn't find

any people with experience, they

wouldn't work for the pay or

refused to work for the show.  I

don't know and nobody in this room

probably knows either.  I'm looking

at this as a unique opportunity.

We all should.  I'm a damn good

writer and I'm ready to go to work.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

This thing was rigged, the deck was

stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don

King be near?  Good thing Sloan had

my back.  She's my rock.  This was

going to be a whole lot of work.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

David, I appreciate your comments.

Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody

just talk out loud.

MONA

I've always liked the format of

Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."

ANNA

That could be cool.

KIRK

What about something like "The

Jeffersons?"  I grew up in Idaho so

that's how I got my understanding

of black people.  Through Sherman

Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.

DAVID

"Good Times" was better.  Kid Dy-no

mite!!!

49.

AARON

You pole are going to far back for

me.  I think we have to go after a

hipper feel.  Like the stuff Eddie

Murphy used to do on "Saturday

Night Live."

PETER

Or Martin.  You go girl.

JEFF

What about the  black exploitation

films?  No one has ever tried

making that work on TV.

DAVID

And for reason.  Have you ever seen

"Scream Blacula, Scream?"

MONA

I think, and Delacroix will agree

with me, the politics of this show

have to be right.  We should always

be laughing with our characters,

not at them.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

The mission was accomplished.  All

of these people left the room

thinking they would have real input.

I was writing this pilot alone,

myself, me.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Now came the fun part, finding the

talented performers to cast in the

show.

50.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Everybody and their mother was

trying to get in, trying to be seen.

Trying to get their piece of the

rock.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

This was amazing.  Who had told

these Negroes that this was what we

were looking for?  The same old

image, it damn for sure wasn't me.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Were people this desperate to get

work?

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Thanks, Ms. Lulu.

LULU

But I had several more poems.

DELACROIX

That's good.  We've seen enough.

We'll get back to you.

51.

RUTH (O.S.)

Next.

SLOAN

This is the group I was telling you

about.

DELACROIX

Which one is your brother?

SLOAN

The big one.

RUTH

Let's get started here.

BIG BLACK

The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place.

That's right, the Mau-Mau's.

DELACROIX (O.S.)

What's your name?

BIG BLACK

My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

DELACROIX (O.S.)

And what are the Mau-Mau's going to

do for us today?

BIG BLACK

We gonna drop some knowledge,

wisdom and understanding.  The Mau-

Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop

science.

52.

DELACROIX

We're ready when you are.

BIG BLACK

Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One.

Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots

to give my peeps some props.

Brothers introduce yourself.

DOUBLE BLACK

Yo, I'm Double Black.

BLACK BLACK

Check it, Black Black.

SMOOTH BLACK

I'm Smooth Black, the lover in dis'

piece.

HARD BLACK

Hard Black.

MO BLACK

He's Jo Black.

JO BLACK

And he's Mo Black.

1/16TH BLACK

I'm last but not least, you can

call me 1/16th Black.

DELACROIX

Good.  We're really blacked-oops,

backed up, so shall we begin?

BIG BLACK

Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One.

Two.  Yo, the name of this joint is

BLAK IZ BLAK.  Hit it.

53.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did

not fit into our plans.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As I told Sloan, there's a black

sheep in every family.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Finland.  This is a travesty.  A

debacle.  A mockery.

DUNWITTY

Delacroix.  This is the director I

was telling you about.  Jukka Laks.

JUKKA

So nice to meet you.

DELACROIX

Nice to meet you.  If you don't

mind me asking you - how old are you?

JUKKA

I just turned twenty.

DUNWITTY

I'm gonna leave you two creative

geniuses alone.

DELACROIX

Dunwitty, don't leave.

54.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Where are you from?

JUKKA

Helsinki, which is the capital of

Finland.

DELACROIX

Finland.

JUKKA

You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

DELACROIX

Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever

seen a Negro person before?  Even

had a real conversation with a real

Negro before?

JUKKA

What's a Negro.

DELACROIX

A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle.

An abomination.

DELACROIX

Did you just ask me what's a Negro?

I'M A NEGRO!!!

JUKKA

Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term

before.  I thought you were BLACK

of African-American.  No?

DELACROIX

Well before there was BLACK or

AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were

NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.

JUKKA

Thank you for correcting my

ignorance.  I'm looking forward to

working side by side with you.  I

feel we make a good team.

55.

DELACROIX

How did you get this gig?

JUKKA

My visual style is very erotic,

sexy, how do you say - hot?

DELACROIX

This is a TV show, not a music video.

JUKKA

Then will you teach me what I need

to know.  Maybe we learn from each

other, if that's possible, no?

DELACROIX

This is a travesty.  A debacle.

SLOAN

You've said that already.

DELACROIX

I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my

throat.  For the love of Joseph.

DELACROIX

For the love of Joseph and Mary.

DELACROIX

I will not be held responsible for

these revisions.  These changes are

not the way I want to go.  This is

an outrage.  This is a sham.  A

violation!

DUNWITTY

Calm down, please.

JUKKA

In Finland, when we get upset...

56.

DELACROIX

I don't give a good goddamn about

Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever

ya blond ass came from.

DUNWITTY

We just punched it up a bit.  Made

it funnier.

DELACROIX

Funnier to who and at who's expense?

Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run

amok, the boycotts, when the

demostrations commence, I'm giving

them your home address.  Let's see

how you like it when they picket

your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

DUNWITTY

I seriously doubt that will ever

happen.  Didn't I tell you I know

your people better than you do.

But if by some miracle you're

correct, I'm gonna invite them

inside my house and we'll have a

sit down, discuss it like civil

human beings.

DELACROIX

Just want to say good luck.

SLOAN

Break a leg.

DELACROIX

Wait a minute.  Hold up.

57.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Can I kiss you too?

MANTAN

Naw.  I'll take the zero.

DELACROIX

You feel good, not nervous?

MANTAN

I feel fine.

DELACROIX

Not nervous?  Relaxed?

MANTAN

Sloan, will you take your boss out

of here so I can get ready.

SLEEP 'N EAT

How's the audience?

DELACROIX

Fired up.

SLOAN

How you feelin'?

SLEEP 'N EAT

Good.  I'm not sure about this

material.

DELACROIX

The material is fine.

SLEEP 'N EAT

You really think so?

DELACROIX

We're trying to do something new

here, some groundbreaking stuff.

SLEEP 'N EAT

It's the bone breaking stuff I'm

worried about.

58.

SLOAN

Everything's gonna be alright.  You

and Mantan will be huge stars after

tonight.

SLEEP 'N EAT

You really think so?

DELACROIX

Your life will never be the same.

SLOAN

Let's leave the man in peace so he

can get ready.

SLOAN

We both lied to him.

DELACROIX

What do you want me to say?

SLOAN

Just don't lie to me.

DELACROIX

Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.

JUKKA

Thank you very much.  I always try

my best.

59.

DUNWITTY

I want you to meet my lovely wife

Verna.  Honey, this is Pierre

Delacroix and Sloan Hopkins.

VERNA

Nice to meet you.

DELACROIX

Same here.

SLOAN

The pleasure is mine.

VERNA

My husband has been raving about

the awesome work you've done.  How

did you ever think of something

like this?  It's absolutely

brilliant.  Pure genius.

DELACROIX

I guess it was divine inspiration.

VERNA

Hope to see you both after the

taping.  Congrats in advance.

SLOAN

Divine inspiration?

DELACROIX

I was trying to be nice.

60.

SLOAN

I want to apologize about my

brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I

should not have imposed them on you.

DELACROIX

C'mon.  You were only doing what

family is supposed to be doing for

family.  You gave your brother a

shot.  That's all anybody can ask

for, an opportunity, a chance, a

shot.  He got his.

SLOAN (V.O.)

We should blacken up like they did

it back in the day.  Keep the

ritual the same.

SLOAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Pour some alcohol on the corks,

then light it.

SLOAN (V.O.)

Let them burnt to a crisp, and when

burnt out, mash them to a powder.

61.

SLOAN (V.O.)

Add water, mix to a thick paste.

SLOAN (V.O.)

And voila!  You have your blackface.

SLOAN (V.O.)

Please put cocoa butter on your

face and hands...

SLOAN (V.O.)

To protect your skin.

62.

SLOAN (V.O.)

The final detail...

SLOAN (V.O.)

...are the lips.

SLOAN (V.O.)

The redder the lipstick the better.

I suggest firetruck red.

SLEEP 'N EAT

Show...

MANTAN

...TIME!!!

63.

MANTAN

This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

SLEEP 'N EAT

And this is my very best friend

Mantan.

BOTH

We're two real COONS!

MANTAN

We both left the hustle and bustle

of Uptown, Harlem...

SLEEP 'N EAT

...the big apple, New York, New York.

MANTAN

To come back to our roots.

SLEEP 'N EAT

Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're

getting countrified.  We is Bama's.

MANTAN

No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't

you smell the sweet aroma of the

ripe watermelons and high cotton?

SLEEP 'N EAT

Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.

MANTAN

Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.

SLEEP 'N EAT

Give or cousins some of dem educated

feets.

SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)

Cousins, first, second, third and

distant, let's have Mantan take us

all the way back to a much more

simpler time.  A time wen men were

men, women were women, and Neggras

knew their place.

64.

MANTAN

Cousins, I want all of you to go to

your windows.  Go to your windows

and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the

drugs, the crack babies born out of

wedlock to crackhead aids infested

parents.  I'm tired of the inflated

welfare rolls while good wholesome

Americans bring less and less of

their paycheck home every two weeks.

I'm tired, you're tired, we're all

tired of these so-called bible-

thumping God fearing, whore mongling

Professional athletes.  Aren't you

tired of these basketball-dunking,

football-running, hop-hip rapping

ebonic-speaking sex offenders who

got ten kids from ten different

Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep

'N Eat.

SLEEP 'N EAT

You tellin' the truth.

MANTAN

Go to your windows and yell out,

scream with all the life you can

muster up inside your assaulted,

bruised and battered bodies.  I'M

SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M

NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

65.

DELACROIX

Hello?

66.

DUNWITTY

Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from

the CNS brass.  They saw some clips

from the pilot and they're rushing

it onto the air.  Yo, we're a

midseason replacement, ordered 12

shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya

hear what I just said, Yo?

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

They didn't even view a rough cut,

just some scenes we quickly cut

together.

DELACROIX

This has to be a big mistake.

DUNWITTY (O.S.)

The big mistake was my not believing

in your genius earlier.  From the

gitgo, from jump street.

DELACROIX

Hold on a sec, I got a call.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of

this other call.

DELACROIX (O.S.)

I gots to go, it's my Moms.

DUNWITTY

I want to meet her one day, please

tell her the great news.  I'm OUT

like Vanilla Ice.

67.

ORCHID

Peerless, your father called.

DELACROIX

I'll be right over.

MANTAN

So what's up with you?

SLOAN

What do you want to know?

MANTAN

The good stuff.

SLOAN

I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my

life.  Can't go anywhere without an

inhaler.

MANTAN

What else?

SLOAN

Are you trying to rap to me?

ORCHID

He wants you to come and see him.

DELACROIX

He said that?

ORCHID

Yes he did.

DELACROIX

Where is he?

ORCHID

He's performing at some place

outside of Richmond, Virginia.

DELACROIX

I can't go all the way down south.

68.

ORCHID

Richmond is not all the way down

south.

DELACROIX

I don't even know why you're still

concerned over him.  Daddy's not

with you.

ORCHID

Regardless, he still is your father.

DELACROIX

It's gonna be hard for me to get

away with the show taking off.

ORCHID

Even more reason to see him.  He'll

be overjoyed with your success.

DELACROIX

C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been

impressed with anything I've ever

done.  From winning my fifth grade

Spelling Bee to the present.

ORCHID

Peerless, last time, go see your

father.

SLOAN

Are you trying to seduce me?

SLOAN (CONT'D)

You think that's gonna work, huh?

69.

DELACROIX

I figured this was a good time to

get away.  Just jump in my ride and

go.  I always did my best thinking

when I was driving alone.  I needed

to think out clearly what I was

going to do with this MANTAN - THE

NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

70.

JUNEBUG

'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please

show me some respect.  I'm up here

trying to make a living.

MAN

Mind yo' business.

JUNEBUG

Don't make me have to come over

there and whoop you upside ya head.

JUNEBUG (CONT'D)

Just messin' with ya.  But please

if you and your lady need to

discuss something, take it outside.

Thank you.

71.

DELACROIX

Brother man, that's my father up

there and I drove a long way to see

him perform.  Please take this

fifty, go buy you and the young

lady some drinks in the club.

MAN

That's yo' Daddy?

MAN (CONT'D)

Don't need yo money for drinks.

Besides, she's drunk already.

C'mon, let's go.

JUNEBUG

Don't bring your woman out if you

can't keep her in deep check.  If

my woman ever did something crazy

like that I'd put my size 12 dead

up in her ass.

JUNEBUG (O.S.)

What do you want?

DELACROIX

I want to speak with you.

JUNEBUG (O.S.)

Go away, unless you got my money.

DELACROIX

It's me, Peerless.

72.

JUNEBUG

Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

DELACROIX

It's been a long time.

JUNEBUG

Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me,

this is my lady DOT.

DELACROIX

Pleased to meet you.

DOT

Glad to meet you, too.  You are all

your father talks about.

DELACROIX

Is that so?

JUNEBUG

Honey, pour me and my son a drink.

DOT

I'll leave you two alone.

JUNEBUG

Good woman.  I trained her right.

DELACROIX

Daddy, she's younger than me.

JUNEBUG

My game is still strong.  No Viagra

for me, don't need no chemicals.

Just my tonic.

JUNEBUG (CONT'D)

Purely for medicinal purposes.

DELACROIX

I thought you had promised Mommy

you stopped.

73.

JUNEBUG

I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I

just like to drink.

DELACROIX

How did you end up here?

JUNEBUG

How did I end up at the third rate

chittlin' circuit greasy hole in

the wall in West Hell, Virginny?

Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?

DELACROIX

That's what I'm askin'.

JUNEBUG

Because I had too much pride.  Too

much integrity.  I wouldn't lick

nobody's butt.  Some material I

refused to do.

DELACROIX

Daddy, it can't be just because of

that.  There had to be other factors.

JUNEBUG

That's the only reason, period.

They only want one certain kind of

black comic.

DELACROIX

Another one of your conspiracies to

hold ya career back?

JUNEBUG

All I know is what happened to me.

All that other mess I just file

into the "life's too short" category.

JUNEBUG (CONT'D)

Enough about me, what's happening

with you?

DELACROIX

The same old, same old.  Trying to

get my stuff through.

74.

JUNEBUG

Dem white boys giving you a hard

time?

DELACROIX

Nuthin' I can't handle.

JUNEBUG

The truth is never let them seeya

sweat.  You do that, that's half

the battle.

DELACROIX

Where do you go from here?

JUNEBUG

Three nights Charleston, South

Carolina.

DELACROIX

I didn't mean that, in life.

JUNEBUG

In life?  I'ma keep on living,

having a good drink, got me a good

young woman, make a couple of

dollars and make people laugh.

Haven't I always tol' you all

nigga's are entertainers?  The

question is what are you gonna do,

Peerless?

JUNEBUG

I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like

to drink.

DOT

We know that baby.

75.

DELACROIX

Let's get him over to the bed.

JUNEBUG

Baby, you treat me so good.

Peerless, you're a good son, I love

you.  You never gave me no trouble.

DELACROIX

I love you too, Daddy.

JUNEBUG

Always keep 'em laughing.

DELACROIX

How long has my father been like

this?

DOT

Not that often.  He was excited to

see you.

DELACROIX

So he drank himself into a stuper?

DOT

The drinking is for the pain.  It

doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

DELACROIX

So what's up with you?

DOT

I was a hostess at this club, your

Daddy was performing and I had

never laughed so hard in my life.

He asked me to come with him.  I

quit my job and we've been together

ever since.

DELACROIX

Don't tell him it's from me or he

won't take it.

DOT

Your father is proud of you.

76.

DELACROIX

He never showed it.

DOT

He did the best way he knew how,

Junebug is stubborn just like you.

DOT (CONT'D)

I'll take care of him.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

My Daddy.  I'm not mad at him.  Not

at all.  Junebug was the reason I

got into this business in the first

place.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And I thank him for that.  However,

it did me no good seeing him in

that state.  Daddy was a broken man.

He had been a strong man, with

conviction, integrity, principles

and look where it had gotten him.

I had to ask myself did I want to

end up where he was?

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

That was the last time I ever saw

my father.

77.

HONEYCUTT

Everybody say Ho!

AUDIENCE

SLEEP 'N EAT

Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?

MANTAN

Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky,

sexy, little foxy...

SLEEP 'N EAT

Mantan, way too short, too tight.

Get her one of dose...

MANTAN

...to big.  The in-between one, not

too tight, not too lose.

SLEEP 'N EAT

That'll work.  I just bought one

for myself.

SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)

Not for me, my woolly headed cotton

pickin' friend for...

MANTAN

I thought you got rid of...

SLEEP 'N EAT

...that was Vicki, her best friend.

Dat dress will cast ya round...

MANTAN

...dat's too much money.  I can't

'ford it.  I needs me a dress that

cost no mo' than...

SLEEP 'N EAT

...aconite get it dat cheap.

MANTAN

I'll buy her a less expensive

dress, so I can have some money

left over to take her out to dinner.

SLEEP 'N EAT

We should go out on a double date.

81.

MANTAN

I heard ya lady is wild.

SLEEP 'N EAT

No.  That's her second cousin.

Who's married to Li'l Bit.

MANTAN

Oh, because on our first date, she

let me...

SLEEP 'N EAT

...no, she didn't...

MANTAN

...yes she did.

SLEEP 'N EAT

MASSA CHARLIE (O.S.)

Who goes in there?

SLEEP 'N EAT

We'd better hide.

MANTAN

It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa

Charlie.

MASSA CHARLIE

I say who goes in there?

BOTH

There's nobody in here 'cept us

chickens.

DELACROIX

Who's side are you on?

SLOAN

I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's

too funny.

83.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

It was the Day of Reckoning.  After

a massive advertising and publicity

campaign...

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...the public would finally get a

chance to view Mantan.  I was

feelin' a little bit like Dr.

Frankenstein.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

What would their reaction be?  I

hadn't the foggiest.

SLOAN

Everybody shut up.

HONEYCUTT (V.O.)

Calling all my cousins, you're

about to take a trip down to Hang

'Em High Plantation, home of your

two favorite coons, Mantan and

Sleep 'N Eat.

MANTAN

Why they gotta make my nose so big?

CHEEBA

Look at my lips.

JESSICA

I think it looks cute.

84.

HONEYCUTT (V.O.)

Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel

Show is proudly sponsored by...

HONEYCUTT (V.O.) (CONT'D)

pleasure MALT LIQUOR.

HOOCHIE #1

PLAYA #1

85.

HONEYCUTT (V.O.)

Clinical testing has found that

Viagra doesn't work on black

"johnson's."  That's why our

scientists developed Da Bomb for

you.  It makes you feel like a MAN

and it makes dem bitches feel like

Natural Women - I mean Ho's.

PLAYA #2

It makes my nature rise.

HOOCHIE #2

I want to get funked up.

HONEYCUTT

DA BOMB - 125% pure pleasure malt

liquor.

HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)

Oooooo-weeee!!  Da Bomb makes me

wanna get my freak on.

TWO MO' HOOCHIES

Honeycutt, let's get our swerve on@

TIMMY HILLNIGGER

Yo, my name be Timmi Hillnigger.  I

was born and raised up in Strong

Island so you know I know about my

peeps, my niggaz in the git-toe.  I

design and own TIMMI HILLNIGGER

125% Authentic Git-Toe active wear.

DAWG #1

Hillnigger keeps it real.

86.

DAWG #2

Timmi's gots all da latest gear.

TIMMY HILLNIGGER

If you want to keep it really real,

never get out of the git-toe, stay

broke and continue to add to my

multibillion dollar corporation,

Hillnigger collection.  We keep it

so real we give you the bullet holes.

HOE #1

All my niggaz wear Hillnigger or

they don't wear a damn thing at all.

It's Git-toe Fabulous.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

I was sunk, dead.  My goose was

cooked.  The cat was in the bag and

the bag was in the river.

REPORTER

Did you watch MANTAN - THE NEW

MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW last night?

PRESIDENT CLINTON

Yes I did and I can honestly say I

feel it promotes racial healing.

87.

DUNWITTY

I know all of you have seen the

overnight ratings.  Through the

roof.  But in this game you gotta

be one, two, three steps ahead.  I

introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb.

She's the best media consultant in

the biz.

MYRNA

First, I would like to say I love

the show.  It's very courageous.

My parents marched in Selma,

Alabama with Dr. King.

DELACROIX

Why are you here?

MYRNA

Good question, straight to the

point.  I like your style.  Because

of the content of the show we can

expect some spirited reactions.

DUNWITTY

Myrna is here to help us plan our

strategy.

MYRNA

The best defense is offense.

DELACROIX

I thought it was the other way

around.

MYRNA

You get my point.  I've mapped out

some strategies to help bolster our

position.

SLOAN

Which is?

MYRNA

That this is fun.  Nice wholesome

fun.

DUNWITTY

Goldfarb, run it down for them.

88.

MYRNA

The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't

it?  Number One.  We gainfully

employ African Americans, in front

of and behind the cameras.  Two.

Let the audience decide.  Three.

Who put these critics in charge?

These so-called cultural police?

Four.  Who determines what is black?

Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six.

If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.

DUNWITTY

We all stick to this, it's smooth

sailing.

SLOAN

It sounds kinda simplistic to me.

MYRNA

I've done my research.

DELACROIX

These are black folks we're talkin'

about, not some lab mice in a cage.

MYRNA

Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in

African-American studies from Yale,

so I do feel I'm qualified.

DUNWITTY

Let Myrna finish.

MYRNA

Thank you.  And always smile.

DELACROIX

Yeah, show dem pearly whites.

MYRNA

Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name

of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the

word "community" often when talking

about Mantan.  And finally our

biggest plus is you, Pierre

Delacroix.

DELACROIX

Me?

89.

DUNWITTY

Yes you!

MYRNA

This show was created, conceived by

you, a non-threatening African-

American male.  Voila.  End of

argument.  It can't be racist

because you're black.

DELACROIX

I'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!!

SLOAN

So you have your small victory, now

what?

DELACROIX

A small victory isn't that small

when you've been use to losing.

DELACROIX

What is this?

SLOAN

A gift.

DELACROIX

For what?

SLOAN

No matter what you think, you did

come up with something unique.

Open it.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Put a coin in the hand.

90.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Watch this.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Read it on the back.

DELACROIX

The Jolly Nigger Bank.

SLOAN

This is authentic, not a repro,

circa turn of the century.

DELACROIX

Thanks.

SLOAN

I thought it was appropiate.

DELACROIX

Is that good or bad?

SLOAN

It's all good.  You got a hit show,

you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I

love these old black collectibles.

DELACROIX

How so?

SLOAN

To me, it shows part of our history

in this country, a time when we

were considered inferior, sub-human.

91.

GARY BYRD

Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.

He is the creator of the highly

controversial TV show MANTAN.

Let's get right into it.  You have

been called by some in the community

a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.

Why does your show generate such

feelings?

DELACROIX

Because race has always been a

sensitive issue in this country.

Gary, I have no problem with people

disagreeing with the show, it's

when folks start trying to mess

with my inherent right as an

artist, that's when I get mad.  No

one, in any way, shape or form

should be censored.

GARY BYRD

No matter how sexist or racist the

material may be?

DELACROIX

Yes.  And I say yes because who is

to judge?  Who is to stand before

us and say this is righteous and

this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

GARY BYRD

But the line has to be drawn.

DELACROIX

Don't you people get it?  We're in

the 21st Century.  Slavery was over

four hundred years ago.  All that

stuff people talked in the old

days, it's over.  Folks always

crying, white man this, white man

that.  Let's all grow up.

GARY BYRD

Are you trying to excuse our

Holocaust?

DELACROIX

Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a

great Aunt, we called her Sister.

She went to her grave not believing

man had walked on the Moon.

(MORE)

92.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

When I was a little kid, I would

argue with her, "it's on TV."  She

would answer "I don't care what's

on that idiot box.  No MAN is on

the MOON."  Well, there are a lot

of your Negroes just like my Aunt

Sister.  Face up to it.  The world

has changed and if you don't adapt,

change with it, you will be left

behind.  This show is a parody.

Are you telling me that nobody can

use some humor, have some laughs in

their lives?  Is that what you're

telling me?

CUT TO:

DELACROIX (V.O.)

When American people want something,

they want it now, they want it big.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They wanted the hula hoop...

93.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They wanted their yo-yo's.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Who could ever forget those lovable

pet rocks.

CUT TO:

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Beanie Babies...

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Now the latest, hottest, newest

sensation across the nation was...

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

BLACKFACE!!!

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was the rage.

94.

1/16TH BLACK

Big Black, I can't log on the

Mantan Website now, it's overloaded.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

The Mantan - The New Millennium

Minstrel Show at www.nigger.com was

getting 500,000 hits a day.

BIG BLACK

Keep trying.

1/16TH BLACK

I'm on it.

MANTAN

Why is Jess and Reverend Al down

there?

95.

DELACROIX

So they can be on TV.

MANTAN

You sound like the media.

DELACROIX

This is nothing.  It will blow over

by tomorrow.

MANTAN

Same thing Giuliani said.

DELACROIX

Tomorrow it will be all about

cruelty to animals or some sex

scandal.  Besides, there is no such

thing as bad publicity.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Rest your mind.  It's a little

somethin' something.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Those were the last pair of tap

shoes worn by Bill "Bojangles"

Robinson.  In fact, he died with

them on.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

No joke.  Serious.

MANTAN

Hope the same thing doesn't happen

to me.  That's some big shoes to

fill.

DELACROIX

In time.

BIG BLACK

That Tom, That Negro...

96.

DOUBLE BLACK

...that handkerchief head...

BLACK BLACK

...dancing monkey...

1/16TH BLACK

...Benedict Arnold...

BIG BLACK

...that simpleton is holding back

the race.  They got rid of us and

keep those two buffoons, Mantan and

Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

HARD BLACK

Yo, Big Black, Sleep 'N Eat ain't

even a nigger, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

SMOOTH BLACK

He's Mexican, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

MO BLACK

He's Dominican, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

JO BLACK

He's Peter Rican,

y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

BIG BLACK

Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin',

y'knowwhatI'msayin'!

1/16TH BLACK

We know.  We know.  Yo, check it,

my black brothers, we can't let

this slide.  Not this injustice.

Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons

iz ill.

BIG BLACK

1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.

DOUBLE BLACK

Let me gat him.

BIG BLACK

Nah, too easy, this has to be

symbolic, has to be on the world

stage.

97.

SLOAN

This is a nice place.  It must have

cost a pretty penny.

MANTAN

Sloan, I got it like 'dat.

SLOAN

Oh you do, huh?

MANTAN

Just a little something' somethin'.

SLOAN

I hope you save a little somethin'

somethin'.

MANTAN

Gots no intention of ending up broke.

SLOAN

Y'know, at the beginnin' of the

century, African-American had to

perform in blackface.  You ever

heard of Bert Williams?  He was a

great artist.

MANTAN

No, before my time.

SLOAN

You don't read, do you?

MANTAN

Never read a book in my whole life.

SLOAN

Maybe you need to start.

MANTAN

Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

SLOAN

Bert Williams and the rest, they

had to black up.  They had no

choice.  They were considered

3/5ths of a human being.  Did you

know that's written in the

Constitution of the United States?

98.

MANTAN

Why all of a sudden are you flippin'

on me?  This blackface thing was

part of the deal from the git-go.

Don't even try to play it like you

ain't a part of all this.  You down

with Delacroix.

SLOAN

I just don't want you and Cheeba to

get hurt.

MANTAN

We can look out for ourselves.

HONEYCUTT

Let's have a warm nigger applause

for our two favorite coons, Mantan

and Sleep 'N Eat.  TWO REAL COONS!

MANTAN

I fell out of my bed last night.

SLEEP 'N EAT

You slept too near where you got in?

MANTAN

I slept too near where I fell out.

SLEEP 'N EAT

You expect the unexpected in

circumstances of that peculiarity.

99.

MANTAN

Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter

with you?  Using all dose ten

dollar words?

SLEEP 'N EAT

Mantan, it is possible that my

hyphenated sentences are entirely

too complex for all the intellect

contained in that diminutive coconut?

MANTAN

Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis.

Don't cross words with me.

SLEEP 'N EAT

Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?

MANTAN

Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds

me, I've seen a lot of troubles

lately.

SLEEP 'N EAT

How be dat?

MANTAN

I don't know who I am.

SLEEP 'N EAT

Well, I'll be an Alabama porch

monkey's uncle.

MANTAN

Years ago I married a widow who had

a grown-up daughter.  My daddy

visited us often, fell in love with

my stepdaughter and married her.

Thusly he became my son-in-law and

my stepdaughter became my mother

because she was my father's wife.

Soon after dis my wife gave birth

to a son, which of course was my

father's brother in-law and my

uncle, for he was the brother of my

step-mother.  My father's wife also

became the mother of a son.  He was

of course my brother and also my

grandchild for he was the son of my

daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was

my grandmother because she was my

mother's mother.

(MORE)

100.

MANTAN (CONT'D)

Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's

husband and grandchild at one and

the same time.  And lo' and behold,

grandmother is his grandfather, I

Mantan, became my own grandfather.

DUNWITTY

You couldn't hold out any longer,

MANTAN

BIG BLACK

He gots to be did.

1/16TH BLACK

Did he gots to be.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

To my astonishment, not only did

the people in TV land love us, but

also the critics.

102.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Mantan was being hailed as

groundbreaking, barrier breaking,

also earth shaking.  I looked

forward to my awards.  Just

vindication for all my hard work,

all my talent that had been

previously overlooked.

ALEC BALDWIN

The winner for Best New Sitcom is...

The envelope please...

ALEC BALDWIN (CONT'D)

The winner is... Pierre Delacroix

for Mantan - The New Millennium

Minstrel Show!

DELACROIX

Alec Baldwin, this is the very

first time we've ever met, you

don't know this, I'm your biggest

fan and I want you to have my Emmy.

It's for you, out of the deep

bowels of my heart - I don't

deserve this.  You take it.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

If I did that I'd be assured to

work forever.  Delacroix the

grateful Negro.

WOODY HARRELSON

The winner for Best Sit-Com is...

103.

WOODY HARRELSON (CONT'D)

...Pierre Delacroix for Mantan.

Come on up and get your Golden Globe.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

That routine would go over like

gangbusters.  I would be a dancing

fool, Hollywood's new favorite

Negro, move over Danny, Morgan,

Samuel L., move over Whoopi.

DELACROIX

I had it all planned.  To the T.

MANTAN

I'm tired of you pickaninnies

messing up my choreography.  It

goes like this.

MANTAN (CONT'D)

Try it again.

MANTAN (CONT'D)

Better.

MANTAN (CONT'D)

Let's take a ten minute break.

104.

CHEEBA

I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

MANTAN

What are you talkin' about?

CHEEBA

Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking

the Kool-Aid.

MANTAN

Meaning?

CHEEBA

I'm out.

MANTAN

Good.  I've got a broken back from

carrying you all these years anyway.

CHEEBA

So that's what you been doing?

MANTAN

Damn skippy.

CHEEBA

You're in this up till ya neck.

MANTAN

Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano

players.

CHEEBA

You can walk away.  We both can.

MANTAN

Yeah, that's easy for you to do.

You never had any talent.

CHEEBA

I'm so tired of you running that.

I always worked hard for you.  You

think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I

quit.

MANTAN

I'm the star of Mantan, so you do

that.  Quit, walk away.  And don't

come crawling back, either.

105.

SLOAN

Why don't you call him?

MANTAN

For what?  He left.  Not me.

SLOAN

You're sure this is a good idea.

MANTAN

My people love me.

SLOAN

I love you.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

I'll be down front.  You better

start putting your face on.

MANTAN

Y'know what?

SLOAN

What?

MANTAN

You look beautiful like that.

106.

HONEYCUTT

Thank you so very much.  Show me

some love.

HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)

Thank you.  My name is Honeycutt

and I want to welcome you to a very

special evening.  It's always great

coming back to the World Famous

Apollo Theatre.

HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)

As everybody knows if you can make

it here on this stage in front of

the most discriminating audience in

the world you can make it anywhere.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's show

some real Uptown love for Mantan

The Marvelous!

107.

SLOAN

This doesn't change a thing.  I

will still love him.

108.

DELACROIX

Pull ya self together.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

What are you?  A man or a mouse?

Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?

MANTAN

No.

DELACROIX

You getting scared because some

people don't like what you are doing?

MANTAN

Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my

black ass up in dat piece.

109.

DELACROIX

You've made it from the guttermost

to the uppermost.  Don't you know

you should never let them see you

sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

MANTAN

Yeah.

DELACROIX

And now is definitely not the time

to bitch up.

TAVIS SMILEY

Our guest tonight is the

extraordinary, talented performer,

Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

MANTAN

Tavis, thank you for having me.

TAVIS SMILEY

Before we begin, I want to thank

you for coming on my show for your

first television interview.  You

could have chosen Mike Wallace,

Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley,

whatnot but you're here.

MANTAN

I'm more comfortable around my

people.

TAVIS SMILEY

Let's jump right into it.  Your

show has sparked a world of

controversy, provoked a tone of

dialogue.  How do you see all of

this?

MANTAN

Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is

the two-one, the 21st century and

it's all about the money.  Like my

man Mase says, "it's all about the

Benjamins."

110.

TAVIS SMILEY

Money and nothing else?

MANTAN

Money makes the world go round.  It

ain't no joke being poor.  I know

whatI'mtalkin''bout.

Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on

the street.  I've been homeless.

I've learned how to play the game,

work the game, be in the game.

TAVIS SMILEY

Is it inevitable that the game

plays you?

MANTAN

No if you go with the flow, Tavis.

That's what a lot of Negroes don't

understand.  Protesting isn't gonna

do a damn thing.  If people don't

like our satire in our number one

hit show then don't watch it.  Or

better yet write your own show.  Do

it better.

TAVIS SMILEY

Don't you feel that is a simplistic

retort?

MANTAN

I don't know what a retort is, but

it's simple.  Mantan - The New

Millennium Minstrel Show is

UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for

Negroes in Compton or 125th in

Harlem.  This is America.  Our

ancestors helped build this country,

we got a right, just like everybody

else.  I'm not gonna box myself in.

This show makes people think, and

they're laughing at the same time.

TAVIS SMILEY

I admit, that's a very hard thing

to do.  Quickly let's go to the

phones before we pay the bills and

hear from our proud sponsors, DA

BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT

LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA

FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER.

125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN

YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.

(MORE)

111.

TAVIS SMILEY (CONT'D)

Our first caller is Big Black from

Brooklyn.  Go 'head.

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

Microphone check, one, two.  One,

two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show

but Mantan you is foul.  Why you

perpetrating?  You a sellout.

MANTAN

That's our opinion.

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

You're a traitor to the race.  A

tool for the Caucasoids.

MANTAN

Why?  Because I'm successful?

Because I don't use "Causcasoids"

as an excuse for not fulfilling my

dreams?

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

I ain't hearing all dat noise.  You

getting played and you don't even

know it.

TAVIS SMILEY

And Big Black from Brooklyn, what

do you do?

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

What do I do?

TAVIS SMILEY

What do you do?

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

I'm a revolutionary.

MANTAN

That's a job?

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

That's a full time job, especially

when sellouts like you are running

around, acting insane.

TAVIS SMILEY

That's enough.

112.

BIG BLACK (O.S.)

And another thing, you better stay

away from my sister or you better...

TAVIS SMILEY

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no

need to go there.  We can all agree

to disagree without making threats.

DELACROIX

Why'd you do that?

SLOAN

I don't want to hear it.

DELACROIX

How long have you and Hambone been

hangin' out?

SLOAN

You're the one that put us together.

We're friends.

DELACROIX

That crazy brother of yours doesn't

think so.

SLOAN

He's just playing big brother.

DELACROIX

Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with

Mantan?

SLOAN

Please don't go there.

DELACROIX

Dunwitty and I feel you've been

getting too close to him, getting

his mind all messed up.

SLOAN

I can't lie to him.  If he asks me

something, I tell him what I think.

DELACROIX

Do you have to be so damn forthright?

113.

SLOAN

DeLa, you should try it sometime.

Come into the light.

DELACROIX

Light?

SLOAN

That which has been hidden in

darkness is now in the light.  This

bucket of blood.

DELACROIX

You can talk all that mumbo jumbo

if you want to but your hands are

much bloody.  I know where I made

my big mistake.  I have a general

rule, never get involved

romantically with somebody crazier

than you.

DELACROIX

This is crazy.

SLOAN

That's why it will be so much fun.

CUT BACK TO:

SLOAN

That was a mistake, but I don't

regret it.

DELACROIX

The first and only time.  A big

mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you

not to see Mantan anymore.

SLOAN

Work related or otherwise?

114.

DELACROIX

Otherwise.  I trust you know the

difference.  You're an intelligent

woman, finished at NYU.

SLOAN

DeLa, kiss my big black ass.

DELACROIX

And that's how you got me in the

first place.

SLOAN

I want you to please view this.  It

may save your Life.

DELACROIX

You shouldn't even be mad at me

over Sloan.

MANTAN

What you did is dead wrong.

DELACROIX

Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this

business if people don't produce,

they get fired.

MANTAN

Sloan is the hardest working person

I've ever met.

DELACROIX

Let me ask you a question, if I may.

How do you think she got the job in

the first place?  I don't mean to

burst your bubble, Mantan the

Marvelous, but Sloan is an

opportunity.

MANTAN

I don't believe it.

DELACROIX

Do I have to spell it out for you?

In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.

115.

MANTAN

How did you get this gig?

SLOAN

Worked my black ass off, first as

an intern, then worked my way up to

this position.

MANTAN

You leave something out?

SLOAN

After my internship expired, Dela

was impressed and offered me a

position as his assistant.

MANTAN

And?

SLOAN

And what?

MANTAN

Stop playing me Sloan.

SLOAN

Just ask me what you want to know.

MANTAN

Oh, you gonna make me say it.

SLOAN

Say what, Manray?

MANTAN

Did you ever sleep with DeLa?

SLOAN

We did it one time, only once.  It

had nothing to do with the job, it

was stupid.  Everything I've got

I've earned.

MANTAN

Aw, c'mon.

SLOAN

That's ancient history.  That has

nothing to do with you and I.

116.

MANTAN

So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna

use me up just like you used Dela?

Work it to the top.  I never

imagined people in this biz could

flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn

happy DeLa fired ya ass.

SLOAN

Forget about me, are you a puppet

for DeLa?

MANTAN

Don't try to change to the subject.

SLOAN

Why don't you answer?

MANTAN

I know I won't be your puppet.

SLOAN

You can go now.

MANTAN

I wuz leaving anyway, for good.

1/16TH BLACK

Yo, I got da bomb plan.  We gonna

hook homeslice Mantan up nicely.

DELACROIX

Hello, Mommy, how are you?

117.

ORCHID (O.S.)

I'm doing okay.  Been reading about

your show, it's all over everywhere.

I watched it's all over everywhere.

I watched it once.  I thought you

said there would be no buffoonery.

DELACROIX

You going to attack me too.  The

show is a hit.  Aren't you happy

for me?

ORCHID

Of course I'm happy for you.

You've worked very hard for your

success.

DELACROIX (O.S.)

Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy

called?

ORCHID

No.

DELACROIX

Not at all?

ORCHID (O.S.)

You know how your Daddy is.

DELACROIX

If and when he calls, please don't

forget to ask him if he's seen

Mantan.

ORCHID (O.S.)

I won't forget.  When are you

coming up here to see your mother?

DELACROIX

Soon.

118.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

When I thought or imagined that my

favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an

inanimate object, a piece of cold,

cast iron, was moving by itself...

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...I knew I was getting paranoid.

Did I really see what I saw or was

I buggin'?

HONEYCUTT

Is you a nigga?

BOBBY

Hell yeah, I'm a nigga.

HONEYCUTT

Ma'am, is you a nigga?

LOUISE

Yesiree Bob, you darn tootin' I'm a

nigger.

119.

HONEYCUTT

Are you a nigger?

TRE

Yo!

HONEYCUTT

Are you a nigga?

STACY

Honeycutt, I'm a really real

niggress.

HONEYCUTT

You.  You.  Him.  Her.  We're all

God's niggas.  Even the lost souls

who don't know it are niggas cuz

niggas is a beautiful thing.

MANTAN

They don't waste any time, do they?

120.

DELACROIX

Delacroix.  What?!  I'll be right

down.

BUNNING

You better talk to him.  He won't

listen to me.

DELACROIX

Mantan, we got a show to tape.

MANTAN

My name is Manray, goddamnit.

DELACROIX

Kook and the Gang, it's Manray.

Let's do the taping.  You go back

to your dressing room, get dressed

and blacken up.

MANRAY

I'm not playin' myself no mo'.

DELACROIX

How you sound?

MANRAY

I won't do it anymore.

DELACROIX

Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy

Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it

gave me no joy pulling ya coattail

about her, just lookin' out for a

brother.  I feel you, all this

stuff happenin' at once but you

can't let if affect your work.  You

gotta be professional.

MANRAY

I'm always gonna be that.  But I

ain't doing no more buck dancing.

DELACROIX

No costume.  No blackface.

121.

MANRAY

No.  No.

BUNNING

I should notify Dunwitty.

DELACROIX

And I should put my foot dead up in

yo' ass.

BUNNING

I won't be held responsible.

HONEYCUTT

We apologize for the holdup but

without further delay, ladies and

gentlemen, boys and girls, let's

give it up for Mantan.

HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)

C'mon, don't be niggardly, give it

up.  Show Mantan some love.

DUNWITTY

Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.

Delacroix.  Get me Delacroix.

122.

MANRAY

Cousins, I want all of you to go to

your windows.  Go to your windows

and yell, scream with all the life

you can muster up inside your

assaulted, bruised amd battered

bodies.

MANRAY

I'm sick and tired of being a

nigger and I'm not gonna take it

anymore.

DUNWITTY

Drop the curtain.  Drop the curtain.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

Escort him out the building now!

MANRAY

I wasn't finished doing my dance.

DUNWITTY

But you are finished.  Done.

Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen.

I'm gonna slide Honeycutt right

into ya spot.  We won't miss a step.

Get him outta here.

DUNWITTY (CONT'D)

DeLa, I'll deal with you next.

123.

MANRAY

Whaddup?

MANRAY (CONT'D)

Whaddup?

BIG BLACK

You truly are a dancing fool.

1/16TH BLACK

Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

MANRAY

Don't start none, won't be none.

BIG BLACK

You is one dead nigger.

124.

MANRAY

What did I do?

BIG BLACK

What did you do?

BIG BLACK (CONT'D)

Brothers, he asks what did he do?

DOUBLE BLACK

If you don't know there is nuthin'

we can do for you.

BIG BLACK

Nigga, you will be executed.

MANRAY

For singing and dancing?

1/16TH BLACK

You will be done in front of the

world.

MO BLACK

The whole world will be watching.

1/16TH BLACK

Via the internet.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

The Mau-Mau's had come up with a

brilliant, sadistic plan to

broadcast Mantan's execution LIVE

over the internet.

1/16TH BLACK

We have pirated broadcasting

facilities.  No way we can be found

out.  We're in cyberspace.

JO BLACK

Nobody will find you till it's too

late.

125.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

The Mau-Mau's sent anonymous e-mail

proclamations to the websites of

CNN, ABC, MSNBC and CBS.  It was an

invite to witness the Dance of

Death, 9 PM, prime time, tomorrow

night on a site to be designated at

a later date.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

It's no joke getting grilled by the

FBI for five houts.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

I don't know anything.

FBI AGENT

We know you're involved in this

abduction.

CHEEBA

You know more than me.  Why would I

do something like that to my best

friend?  Why?

FBI AGENT #2

You tell us.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

Somehow, someway, somebody had

tipped the sharks off.  It was a

feeding frenzy.

126.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

The X-Force was brought onto the

case.  When something involves the

internet, these are the people IBM,

XEROX, the CIA, FBI, even the US

Government go to.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was a race against time.  The

Dance of Death.

DUNWITTY

Hello, my name is Thomas Dunwitty.

I'm the Senior V.P. of the

entertainment division here at CNS.

I come to you with a heavy heart.

DUNWITTY

This abduction is a cowardly, vile,

sinful and dastardly act and I

promise these creeps will be

prosecuted to the fullest extent of

the law.  This is an attack on your

American way of life...

DUNWITTY

We here at CNS are offering a

$100,000 cash award to any

information that leads to the safe

return home of our dear friend,

Mantan.

127.

DUNWITTY

Help us and in addition you will

get a guest-starring speaking role

on the next Mantan - The New

Millennium Minstrel Show, plus an

added bonus: a lifetime of Da Bomb

125% Malt Liquor.  Let's you get ya

"freak on", as well as a full

wardrobe of Timmi Hillnigger Active

Git Toe Wear.  Mantan, may God

bless you...

BARNETT

Let's go, time's wasting.

BARNETT

They sent the notice out on an

anonymous remailer.

SLOAN

A what?

BARNETT

It's used to mask the origin of an

email, also the computer from which

it's sent.

DELACROIX

There oughta be a law...

BARNETT

Not yet, anyway, it's legal.  We

will find the source where it's

being broadcasted and hosted.

We'll get the people that

bushwhacked Mantan.

SLOAN

Before Manray is dead?

128.

BARNETT

I can't answer that.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

SWAT teams all up and down the East

Coast busted in on known dissidents

looking for Manray.  All the tips

called in, info gathered through

surveillance proved for naught.

BARNETT

The both of you should go home.  We

will keep you abreast.

SLOAN

This is looking like a needle in a

haystack.  It's hopeless.

DELACROIX

Thank you for your help.

BARNETT

The X-Force always gets their man.

DELACROIX (V.O.)

It was ten o'clock and the Dance of

Death was about to commence.

129.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Since a lot of people still didn't

have computers, the networks sought

a court order to carry it live,

taking the feed off the internet.

It was granted.  A life snuff

broadcast right into your living

room.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I had to give it to the Mau-Mau',

they definitely had a sense of

irony.  They chose www.nigger.com

as the website to pirate.

BIG BLACK

We are LIVE on the cyberspace.

Whereas Mantan is a TOM...

BLACK BLACK

Whereas Mantan is a disgrace...

SMOOTH BLACK

Whereas Mantan is a head-scratching,

foot-shuffling Negro...

1/16TH BLACK

Whereas, whereas, where's the ass?

BIG BLACK

Whereas Mantan the dancing fool,

you are condemned to death.

JO BLACK

The Dance of Death.

130.

BIG BLACK

Dance nigger.

SMOOTH BLACK

You got anything to say for yourself?

MANRAY

If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

SMOOTH BLACK

Don't worry.

DELACROIX

Don't dance.  Don't do it.

BIG BLACK

You ain't Blak.

DOUBLE BLACK

Blak you ain't.

131.

SMOOTH BLACK

You a Oreo.  Not Blak.  Not BLAK.

MANRAY

There is nothing you can do to me.

I'm wearing the taps of Bill

"Bojangles" Robinson.

BIG BLACK

Let's seeya dance now, Mr. Bojangles.

BIG BLACK (CONT'D)

You ain' BLAK.

132.

DELACROIX

Leave me alone.  Get away from me.

You spearchucker.  You black sambo.

You nigger pickaninny.  Fat Mammie.

BIG BLACK

It's the man!

1/16TH BLACK

Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I've

been held hostage.  They made me

part of them against my own free

will.  Don't shoot!

1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)

I'm WHITE.  I'm WHITE!  Look at me,

I'm white!

SLOAN

Get up and put that tape in.

133.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Do what I say.

SLOAN (CONT'D)

Don't make me have to use this.

DELACROIX

I didn't think this was in your

studies at NYU.

SLOAN

Watch this.  This is what you

contributed to.  Because of you,

Manray is dead.  Mu brother's dead.

It's all because of you.

DELACROIX

I'm sorry.  I didn't know anyone

would get hurt.  I'm sorry, please

give me that gun before you hurt

yourself.  Give me the gun.

SLOAN

I told you but you wouldn't listen.

You never listened to me.

DELACROIX

Give me the gun.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

Go, get out of here.  Go home.

134.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As I bled to death, as my very

precious life oozed out of me all I

could think of was that I never

made my father proud.  My mother

didn't count.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Everything I did, no matter how

great or small, was always

extraordinary to her.  With Daddy

it was a different ball game.  He

never saw me.  Pierre Delacroix.

DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Now it was time to buy the farm,

for me to meet my maker.  Goodbye

cousins, and please tune in next

week for the Best of Mantan - The

New Millennium Minstrel Show.

DELACROIX (CONT'D)

For the love of Joseph and Mary,

what have I done?  My God, what

have I done?!

CUT TO:

135.

MALCOLM X

You've been had.  You've been took.

You've been led astray.  Run amok.

You've been bamboozled.

FADE TO BLACK.
