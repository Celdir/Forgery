BIERCE

No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr.

Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years

he has been with us, I have never seen a

patient turn his energies to more productive

use.

BIERCE

Just look at his accomplishments... three

volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture

garden, four romance novels... and who can

forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow

in our all-psychotic production of

"Carousel"...

BIERCE

Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.

CASANOVA

Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.

Loveless...

(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)

Fatherless...

(chokes on the word)

A... psycho!

(breaks down sobbing)

Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder...

the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!

(weeping, a brilliant performance)

I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!

CASANOVA

(pulls himself together)

But my deeds have been done, and my youth is

gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel

world... and if I have learned anything from my

wretched life it is that... When you walk

through a storm, keep your head held high...

(singing)

And don't be afraid of the dark...

CASANOVA

(almost wistfully)

Boom.

CASANOVA

Those gas leaks can be murder.

CASANOVA

I'm home.

RED EYE 1

Golf anyone?

RED EYE 2

Not a bad night's work.

BIG RED

Who said crime don't pay?

RED EYE 3

Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.

RED EYE 4

(about to slug him)

Who you laughin' at, punk?

RED EYE 2

He's just a tyke.  Lighten up.

RED EYE 5

He's kinda cute.

RED EYE 3

If you like drool.

RED EYE 2

Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?

For a million bucks!

BIG RED

And what if he rats on us?

RED EYE 3

So what should we do with him?

BIG RED

Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in

the lake.

RED EYE 3

Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

RAJA

Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term

loosely... Unhand that youngster...

SHOVELER

Or you're mulch.

BIG RED

What are you guys supposed to be...

superheroes?

FURIOUS

We ARE superheroes!

BIG RED

Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?

BIG RED

This is our territory.  Beat it.

FURIOUS

Over YOUR dead body.

BIG RED

0ooooo, he's scary.

BIG RED

A fork!

RAJA

And there's plenty more where that came from.

BIG RED

GET 'EM!

RED EYES

Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!

FURIOUS

(barely audible under all that meat)

Is that all you got?

RED EYES

He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him

off!

FURIOUS

(faintly)

Your mother!

VOICE (0.S.)

Is there a problem?

RED EYES

IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!

RED EYES

We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible

childhoods!  (Etc.)

RAJA

Nice work, Captain.

AMAZING

(turning on the old superhero charm)

Hi. Dawn.

DAWN

(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)

Looks like you've done it again, Captain.

AMAZING

It's what I do.

COP 1

Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.

RAJA

Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--

we're superheroes, and we just busted up this

gang.

COP 1

Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and

he's...

(meaning the Shoveler)

Captain Pooper Scooper!

COP 1

Hey!  Move it!

COP 2

Get a life!

COP 1

And leave crime fighting to the real thing!

COP 1

Wannabes.

COP 2

Pathetic.

RAJA

(nursing a sore jaw)

He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

FURIOUS

What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

SHOVELER

Oh don't start that again--

FURIOUS

LOOK!

FURIOUS

He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--

and it's him!

RAJA

There's a vague similarity.

FURIOUS

A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!

SHOVELER

(downing some aspirin)

0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take

this anymore.  Night after night we're on the

streets, busting our humps--and for what?

RAJA

We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

SHOVELER

How long do you have to chase a dream before

you realize it's not gonna happen?

FURIOUS

We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever

heard of him until he busted Casanova

Frankenstein!

RAJA

But look at him... and look at us.

SHOVELER

The camera loves him.

FURIOUS

(furious)

Why do they always fill stuff these things so

full you can't pull 'em out without ripping

'em!

(rips one out)

RAJA

I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting

suspicious, I know it.

FURIOUS

So why don't you just tell her!

RAJA

I can't.

FURIOUS

Why not?

RAJA

(upset)

Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't

understand!

SHOVELER

Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours.

FURIOUS

We had an off night, that's all.

SHOVELER

So when are we gonna have an on night?

WAITRESS

Hi.

RAJA

You're... new.

WAITRESS

It's my first night.  My name's Monica.

MONICA

You guys going to a costume party?

RAJA

We're superheroes.

MONICA

Really?  Like Captain Amazing?

MONICA

Are you famous?

RAJA

Not yet.

MONICA

So you're like... struggling superheroes?

RAJA

We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I

am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...

(does a very impressive

little flipping thing with

his place setting)

MONICA

Wow.

RAJA

And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler.

SHOVELER

Hi.

RAJA

And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

MONICA

(intrigued by Furious)

Really?

RAJA

Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or

a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely

emotional.

MONICA

So what can I get you?

RAJA

Burgers all around.

(meaning himself)

Medium.

(meaning the Shoveler)

Rare.

(meaning Furious}

Raw.

RAJA

She likes you.

SHOVELER

Definitely.

RAJA

Ask her out.

FURIOUS

Nah.

RAJA

Roy, when was the last time you had an actual

date?

FURIOUS

(getting very pissed off)

What does it matter?  Women just want to

control you--and talk about their feelings.

They want to know why you're angry all the

time--and what can they can do to help--so you

tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave

me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and

they bug you--until you just can't stand it

anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like

a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all

your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all

of it!

(after a beat)

And then they dump you.

RAJA

So you're chicken?

FURIOUS

(fiercely)

Who's chicken?

(gets up)

FURIOUS

Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you

really want to talk to somebody you can't think

of anything to say!

MONICA

I guess... Are you always so angry?

FURIOUS

Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

FURIOUS

Want to go out and get drunk?

FURIOUS

Or talk?

MONICA

Not tonight.

(picks up an order and walks away)

RAJA

Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

FURIOUS

(gets on his old Harley)

Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?

RAJA

Or flowers.

FURIOUS

See ya tomorrow.

SHOVELER

Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place

up?

TRACY

When you're on TV.

EDDIE JR.

Right--like that will ever happen.

LENORE

Save any babies lately?

TRACY

Faster than a speeding turtle--

BUTCH

More powerful than a deodorant--

EDDIE JR.

Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

LENORE

Look, snoring in his chair--

EDDIE JR.

Sitting on the john--

ALL

It's... Supergut!

LUCILLE

(feels for him)

Rough night, Eddie?

MOTHER

Jeffrey!

RAJA

Oh hi, Mom.

MOTHER

What are you doing in the silver drawer?

RAJA

Looking for... the TV Guide.

MOTHER

It's on the television.

RAJA

Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.

Go to bed.

FURIOUS

Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be

amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred

million bucks... or two bucks... or two

cents...

(hurls the empty bottle, smashing

it against the sign)

Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true.

FURIOUS

Where's he going?

(kicks his Harley started)

AMAZING

(just as he suspected)

Uh-huh.

CASANOVA

I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a

dozen Cubans to get them.

TONY P

Ummm.

CASANOVA

Have you considered my offer?

TONY P

You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved

workin' for you.  You had such style: the

clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd

snuff a babe.  You were the King...

TONY P

But times have changed, and you been in that

bug house a long tine. I can see you still got

the style, but I dunno for sure you still got

the edge.

CASANOVA

I got it.

TONY P

What about Captain Amazing?

AMAZING (O.S.)

Good question.

CASANOVA

I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open

for you.

AMAZING

I know you did.

CASANOVA

I knew you'd know.

AMAZING

I know you knew I'd know.

CASANOVA

But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

AMAZING

Of course.

AMAZING

I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of

scum like you, Tony.

AMAZING

The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months

watching you, and know exactly what you're up

to.

CASANOVA

Really?

AMAZING

I know that you're recruiting your old

henchmen...

AMAZING

I know who your girlfriend really is...

AMAZING

And I know the terrible revenge that you plan

to inflict on this city.

CASANOVA

I guess you know just about everything, don't

you, Lance?

AMAZING

Um-hmm.

CASANOVA

Except for one little thing.

AMAZING

(supremely confident)

And what's that?

CASANOVA

That I've hot wired the city's entire power

supply through that catwalk.

AMAZING

What--?

BOSS

YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at

home, or you'll be a full time superhero!

ANTHONY

It's all within your power.  The only thing

that's in your way is YOU!

RAJA

Easy for you to say.

SALLY

Hey, Roy!

SALLY

How many times I gotta tell you about this?

FURIOUS

Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They

don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a

classic!

SALLY

It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!

RADIO ANNOUNCER

...and continues to deny any knowledge of the

incident... In local news, millionaire Lance

Hunt has apparently disappeared...

RADIO ANNOUNCER

Members at his household told police that the

playboy philanthropist failed to return home

last night after "going out for a walk".

Police say they have no reason yet to suspect

foul play, but a search is under way...

FURIOUS

I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!

RAJA

But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

SHOVELER

Hey, look.

CASANOVA

Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my

life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to

give back something to my old home town...

That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune

to build...

CASANOVA (O.S.)

The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.

DON

You've changed, haven't you?

CASANOVA

Oh yes.

FURIOUS

No he hasn't.

FURIOUS

(about to climb over)

Let's go.

RAJA

(in a whisper, holding him back)

Wait!... Look!

RAJA

This is bad.

SHOVELER

Who are they?

RAJA

The Disco Boys.

FURIOUS

The who?

RAJA

The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever

produced.  Twenty years ago they were

Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he

was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

FURIOUS

Well they've crawled back out.

SHOVELER

We may be getting in over our heads here.

RAJA

This looks like a job for Superman--

SHOVELER

Or Batman--

RAJA

Or both.

FURIOUS

Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is

still in there, we can rescue him--and get on

TV!

(goes right over the wall)

CASANOVA

Everything's going exactly as we planned.

ANABEL

(puts the sharp point of her

comb handle under his chin)

Not quite.  You haven't announced our

engagement yet.

CASANOVA

It must have slipped my mind.

ANABEL

Your mind is so slippery.

CASANOVA

Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are

over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my

Nicole.

(pulls her into his arms)

We're such an incredible team.  Who could

possibly stop us?

(kisses her)

RAJA

Don't crunch the leaves.

SHOVELER

Sorry.

RAJA

Be a Mohican.

(bumps into a lawn chair)

FURIOUS

Wait.

(They all stop.)

I hear something.

RAJA

I'm soaked.

(sneezes)

Oh great.

FURIOUS

Shhh.

SHOVELER

Be a Mohican.

RAJA

Shut up.

FURIOUS

Come on.

RAJA

Uh-oh.

RAJA

Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.

TONY P

You sure do.

CASANOVA

Hi there.

CASANOVA

Superheroes.

TONY P

Should I kill them?

CASANOVA

(completely disdainful)

Why bother?

MONICA

Here you go.

(sits with them, applies a compress

to the Raja's head)

RAJA

Ow.

MONICA

Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero

stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

FUSSY CUSTORER

Miss!

RAJA

Maybe she's right.

FURIOUS

(still furious)

Are you serious? This is the break we've been

waiting for!

SHOVELER

What are you talking about?

FURIOUS

What have the famous superheroes got that we

don't?

RAJA

Agents?

FURIOUS

Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal--

he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our

ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

SHOVELER

And it would be the right thing to do.

FURIOUS

(dismissively)

Yeah yeah--and that, too.

RAJA

But there's only three of us, and he's got the

entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

FURIOUS

Then maybe it's time for us to form our own

brotherhood...

(more)

FURIOUS (Cont'd)

a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting,

skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of

the night!

SHOVELER

I'm liking this.

FURIOUS

I say we send out the word--and summon all of

the unsung superheroes we know!

RAJA

(after a moment)

Yeah, but... who do we know?

FURIOUS

Well... there's the Spleen.

RAJA

Do we have to?

SHOVELER

I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he

claims he can become invisible.

FURIOUS

Have you ever seen him?

SHOVELER

How could I see him if he's invisible?

FURIOUS

Good point.

RAJA

And there's the Sphinx.

SHOVELER

The who?

RAJA

He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting

superwrestler and master of the machete.

FURIOUS

Sounds good.

RAJA

No one's sure that he actually exists, but they

say he can be contacted by leaving a message on

a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by

the bus station.

SHOVELER

Get outta here.

FURIOUS

You sure that's how you spell it?

SHOVELER

Yeah.

FURIOUS

So, let me get this straight.  You have the

power to become invisible.

INVISIBLE BOY

Yes.

RAJA

But... only when no one is looking.

INVISIBLE BOY

Yes.

FURIOUS

If someone looks at you, you immediately become

visible again.

INVISIBLE BOY

Yes.

RAJA

So you're only invisible... to yourself?

INVISIBLE BOY

No.

OUR HEROES

(hopefully)

No?

INVISIBLE BOY

If I look at myseif, I become visible.

RAJA

So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no

one is looking at you?

INVISIBLE BOY

Yes.

FURIOUS

So how do you know that you've ever been

invisible?

INVISIBLE BOY

I just know.

FURIOUS

Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to

interview--

INVISIBLE BOY

(desperate)

I know I haven't got it entirely worked out

yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a

superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid?

Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a

chance?

SPLEEN

Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when

you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?

(sucks it in)

I've always dreamed of being a member of the a

real superhero team--and to have friends--real

friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep

with--die with--eat with...

SPLEEN

I love mustard.

INVISIBLE BOY

So what exactly is your superpower?

SPLEEN

Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-

-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to

go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--

stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died,

but I lived, and I grew all these like weird

organs that have never been seen in humans

before.  So now I can do things like this!

SPLEEN

Cool, huh?

FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER

Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!

SPLEEN

Sorry, sorry.

SHOVELER

Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?

SPLEEN

I tried that once.  The cork melted.

SHOVELER

There's just not enough of us.

FURIOUS

But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe

thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who

desperately need a cause...

RAJA

And a social life.

SHOVELER

Yeah, but how do we get to them?

SPLEEN

Obscene phone calls?

MONICA

Why don't you throw a barbecue?

(moves off to another table)

SPLEEN

Come on in!  The water's great!

BUTCH

(heavy on the sarcasm)

Great picnic, Dad.

EDDIE JR.

Big turnout.

ROLAND

Are these guys real superheroes?

LENORE

They think so.

ROLAND

But where's Captain Amazing?

EDDIE JR.

He wouldn't be caught dead here.

SPLEEN

Hey, these pool mints are delicious!

RAJA

Maybe there was traffic.

FURIOUS

Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.

We're living in a fantasy!

INVISIBLE BOY

Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

FURIOUS

Good or evil, what's the difference?

SHOVELER

There's a big difference.

FURIOUS

I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.

RAJA

Roy, remember, it is all within your power.

The only thing that's in your way... is you.

FURIOUS

Oh shut up.

INVISIBLE BOY

They're here!

THEIR LEADER

Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

RAJA

This is it.  Come on in!

SUPERHEROES

All right!  Party!  (Etc.)

RAJA

I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.

THEIR LEADER

I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres,

the Invincible Dudes!

INVINCIBLE DUDES

Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)

RAJA

Would you mind filling out these forms; names,

addresses, description of superpowers, that

sort of thing.

INVINCIBLE DUDES

Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)

(but they just toss the forms away)

INVINCIBLE DUDE 1

Hey, man, like where are the babes?

INVINCIBLE DUDE 2

It said on the card there'd be babes!

RAJA

Actually we lied about the babes, but there's

plenty of burgers.

INVINCIBLE DUDES

That's false advertising!... We came all the

way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone

plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!

SQUEEGEE MAN

No babes.  No peace.

INVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)

No babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No

babes--no peace!

SQUEEGEE MAN

Let's trash the place!

INVINCIBLE DUDES

Yeah!

FURIOUS

If you're a superhero, what's your power?

SQUEEGEE MAN

I am Squeegee Man.

(holding it out threateningly)

Touch my squeegee... and you die.

FURIOUS

Can you fly?

SQUEEGEE MAN

No.

FURIOUS

Wanna bet?

INVINCIBLE DUDES

Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!

BOWLER (O.S.)

Who died?

RAJA

Who are you?

BOWLER

I'm the Bowler.

SHOVELER

The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a

kid.  He was killed years ago.

BOWLER

I'm his daughter.

SHOVELER

Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a

guy thing.

BOWLER

Really?

BOWLER

Good ball.

BOWLER

If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be

impressed, right?

FURIOUS

Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

BOWLER

I thought you'd never ask.

BOWLER (O.S.)

He was more than just a superhero...  He was my

father...

BOWLER

And then one day, he didn't come home.  The

police said it was an accident.  But cargo

containers don't just fall on people.  He was

murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped

out of school, became a mud wrestler, married

and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit

bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her

attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and

costume, almost like he'd left them there for

me... and I knew what I had to do.

SHOVELER

So who killed him?

BOWLER

The Disco Boys.

FURIOUS

You know something? Those guys are really

starting TO PISS ME OFF!

SHOVELER

But there's still only six of us.

FURIOUS

SO WHAT?

BOWLER

That's two more than the Fantastic Four.

FURIOUS

Half a Dirty Dozen!

SPLEEN

Twice the Three Stooges!

INVISIBLE BOY

And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.

RAJA

And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.

BOWLER

He was cute though.

RAJA

But they all had one thing we haven't got.

SPLEEN

Girlfriends?

RAJA

A name.  All the great superhero teams have got

a fabulous name.

BOWLER

How about... the Savage Six?

RAJA

The Inscrutable Six?

SPLEEN

The Six Pistols?

SHOVELER

The Exterminators!

INVISIBLE BOY

The Obliterators!

RAJA

The Eradicators!

BOWLER

The Emasculators!

SPLEEN

Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.

FURIOUS

To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.

TONY P

Little old lady.  That's a hundred points!

TONY P

He knows your every move.

FURIOUS

Let's say hello.

TONY P

Not these guys again!

CASANOVA

Nice car.

FURIOUS

What did you do with Captain Amazing?

CASANOVA

Captain who?

TONY P

(spots the Bowler)

Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to

be, the Bowler?

BOWLER

I'm his daughter.

TONY P

His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart?

I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he

squished real good!

TONY P

HEY!

FURIOUS

'SCUSE ME!

TONY

Waste him!

FURIOUS

Shall I check your oil?

FURIOUS

Looks fine.

FURIOUS

NICE CAR!

CASANOVA

(impressed by Furious)

That boy's got talent.

TONY P

And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

SHOVELER

To us!

RAJA

Whatever our name is.

SHOVELER

Even his snores smell bad.

BOWLER

But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.

RAJA

I can't.

INVISIBLE BOY

Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid

waste of time.

SHOVELER

But he plays golf, right?

INVISIBLE BOY

Yeah.

RAJA

I'm her only son, and she always had such high

hopes for me. Medicine.  Law.

BOWLER

But you're a superhero.

RAJA

The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't

understand.

BOWLER

I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I

put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.

RAJA

But in fact... you'd found it.

SHOVELER

This is your dream... and you can't ever give

it up.

INVISIBLE BOY

I wonder what he dreams about?

SHOVELER

We don't want to know.

TONY P

There.

BOWLER

It's late.  I'm headin' home.

RAJA

Me, too.

BOWLER

(to Invisible Boy)

Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

FURIOUS

Anybody up for a little White Castle?

TONY P

Hi, cutie.

TONY P

Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any

last words, Angry Boy?

FURIOUS

Disco sucks.

TONY P

Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm

gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful?

I'm gonna save you for last.

TONY P

Sweet dreams, punk.

TONY P

(holding half a pistol)

HOLY...

MAN IN MASK

Buenos naches.

TONY P

Get him!

MAN IN MASK

(Mexican accent)

Would you like me to trim the sides?

TONY P

What?

TONY P

(freaking out)

LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

FURIOUS

You're the Sphinx.

SPHINX

And you are a fool.

SPHINX

You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster

fights more intelligently than you!  You have

shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your

powers to him--and what have you accouplished

for this?  You have destroyed his car.

Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must

fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

SPHINX

The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is

his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a

team...

(more)

SPHINX (Cont'd)

(at Furious)

Not like some drunken Tejano on Saturday night.

SPHINX

Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.

You will need more than shovels and dessert

forks to stop him... What else have you got?

FURIOUS

(angrily)

So what else has Superman got?

SHOVELER

He's got the fact that he's Superman!

BOWLER

Bullets bounce off him!

RAJA

Firepower costs money.

INVISIBLE BOY

Anybody got any?

SHOVELER

We didn't think this through very well.

BOWLER

(after a moment)

My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

SHOVELER

Are you sure he's still lives here?

RAJA

Are you sure he's still alive?

BOWLER

He was the last time I saw him.

SHOVELER

When was that?

BOWLER

I was eight.

HELLER

Yes!

BOWLER

Doctor Heller?

HELLER

(doesn't recognize her)

Yes!

BOWLER

It's me... Elizabeth.

HELLER

Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so...

middle aged!

BOWLER

Thanks.

HELLER

How's your dad?

BOWLER

He's dead.

HELLER

Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of

a guy.

BOWLER

Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes,

and we need your help.

HELLER

Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that

sort of covers--

SPHINX

Doctor, we need your weapons.

HELLER

(ecstatic)

My weapons? You need my weapons?

HELLER

The military establishment has never understood

me.  They won't return my phone calls, much

less field test anything.  But I knew that

someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you

are!

(pulls open the barn door)

RAJA

But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

SHOVELER

The bazookas?

INVISIBLE BOY

The lasers?

HELLER

You don't need that junk!  You see, for

thousands of years mankind has been immolating,

disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why?

Because we have this built-in screwed up need

to go to war!

(more)

HELLER (Cont'd)

So as a young man I thought, why nat have the

fun and excitement of war, without all that

unnecessary bloodshed.  That's why I have

devoted my life to developing an arsenal of

highly sophisticated non-lethal military

weapons.

(points to a hand held tube)

Air cannons... Blame throwers... Feet seeking

missiles... And perhaps my ultimate

invention...

(picks up one of the small cans)

The canned tornado.

HELLER

Now here's a beauty!

(picks up a purple and orange sprayer

that looks like a suped up water gun)

I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after

years of studying the worst dry cleaners I

could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to

half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is

immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

FURIOUS

Let's get out of here.

BOWLER

Hey, Mister Bad Mood.

BOWLER

(pulls the ring on the can)

Catch.

HELLER

He's got the air cannon!

FURIOUS

Doc, you're a genius!

(hugs him)

HELLER

I know.

FURIOUS

(turns to the others)

Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it

into the car, drive over to Casanova's house,

and kick some ass!

SPHINX

No.

SPHINX

We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to

fight together... as one thing.

RAJA

Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this

city were united into one great brotherhood of

evil, and Casanova was their king.

SHOVELER

Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in

your home.

BOWLER

Much less go outside.

SHOVELER

Then Captain Amazing appeared.

RAJA

He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

SHOVELER

And this has been a pretty nice place to live

ever since.

FURIOUS

(pissed off)

But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit

around here all night eating pizza and telling

stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

SPHINX

The wise snake coils before he strikes.

FURIOUS

(lunges at the Sphinx)

And a skunk stinks!

SPHINX

You drink too much.

FURIOUS

When are you going to take off that mask?

SPHINX

(pointedly)

When I am sure I am among friends.

RAJA

Roy--

FURIOUS

(snapping at him)

Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

SPHINX

Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds

you to your heart.

FURIOUS

My heart died a long time ago.

SPHINX

It is not dead.  It is hiding.

FURIOUS

Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to

hell with the rest of you!... Look at you.

Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before--

and I don't need you now!

(jumps on to his motorcycle)

The great ones RIDE ALONE!

(kicks the engine started)

Adios, muchachos!

(and he rides off across the field)

BOWLER

Has he always been like this?

MOTHER

(to husband)

Oh this place looks great.

MOTHER

Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and

Daddy will be right beck.

LITTLE FURIOUS

Pow!  Bang!  Wham!

MOTHER

It's nice and cool in here.

FATHER

(as they sit at the bar)

Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

BARTENDER

And here's a banana for your monkey.

BARTENDER

Couple more?

FATHER

You bet.

LITTLE FURIOUS

Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!

MOTHER

OH MY GOD!

MOTHER

Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!

MONICA (0.S.)

Hi.

FURIOUS

Hi.

MONICA

Alone tonight?

FURIOUS

Every night.

SPLEEN

(in a whisper)

Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made

fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd

scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless

you count that night with my cousin--She

recovered fully though--We exchange cards every

Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends

it back...

(spritzes somathing into his mouth,

then offers it to Invisible Boy)

Bug repellent?

INVISIBLE BOY (0.S.)

Where are they going?

SPLEEN

(runs after him)

Kid!

DAWN

...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and

now, in an unrelated story, another one of

Champion City's leading citizens has apparently

disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen

or heard from in a week. Authorities believe

that the hard working superhero may just be

taking a well deserved rest.

DON

Cancun perhaps?

DAWN

Sounds good to me, Don.

FURIOUS

(floundering)

Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I

mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I

mean have a...

MONICA

Date?

FURIOUS

Yeah.

MONICA

I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me

home?

FURIOUS

Sure.

MONICA

That was easy.

(goes back to work)

CASANOVA

Honey, our ship's come in.

DISCO BOY

Just give me the word.

CASANOVA

(gets an idea)

Wait.  I'll be right there.

(hangs up, starts off)

ANABEL

(peeved)

Where are you going?

CASANOVA

Head hunting.

MONICA

I admire you.

FURIOUS

Why?

MONICA

Being a superhero, wanting to save the world.

It's so... unselfish.

FURIOUS

It is?

MONICA

Most people just want to make money or be

famous or something.  But you risk everything,

just to help people.

FURIOUS

(after a moment)

I wouldn't mind being famous.

MONICA

Who wouldn't?

MONICA

I've never been able to figure out what to do

with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a

waitress.

FURIOUS

Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

MONICA

What's your real name?

FURIOUS

Roy.

MONICA

Have you always lived here?

MONICA

Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's

noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.

FURIOUS

It's home.

MONICA

Yeah.

MONICA

I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or

New York, but...

FURIOUS

What have they got that we ain't got?

MONICA

Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to

be here when it does.

FURIOUS

Me, too.

MONICA

You don't seem very angry right now.

MONICA

You know what?  Underneath all that anger I

think there's just a little boy who wants

everyone to love him.

FURIOUS

I just want to be a superhero.

MONICA

That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

CASANOVA

Going my way?

CASANOVA

Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to

have a little chat... That was quite a number

you did on my car.  You've got a lot of

violence in you... and I like that in a guy.

CASANOVA

You know what the difference is between good

and evil, Roy?

CASANOVA

Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you

just take it, and if somebody gets in your way,

you kill them... You seem like a very

frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.

What is it that you've always wanted, always

desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it

to you... Fame?

(snaps his fingers)

Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women?

(laughs)

The easiest of all.

CASANOVA

I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In

two days this entire city will belong to me,

and there's not a damn thing your little pals

can do about it.  It's the perfect time to

switch teams... So what do you say?

FURIOUS

(quietly)

You're nuts.

CASANOVA

(flairs)

They always call the great ones nuts.

FURIOUS

And the nuts always call themselves great.

CASANOVA

(his psychosis showing)

Are you with me... or against me?

FURIOUS

Against.

CASANOVA

Too bad.  PLUG HIM!

CASANOVA

WAIT!

FURIOUS

(to Casanova)

Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.

CASANOVA

You're dead.

FURIOUS

So are you!

ANABEL

Be careful with my baby.

GUARD 1

Freeze!

GUARD 2

Hands up!

GUARD 2

What are you two doing here?

GUARD 1

Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn

around, start walking up the hill--

GUARD 2

And no funny business.

SPLEEN

(after a moment, to Invisible

Boy, in a whisper)

Pinch 'em.

INVISIBLE BOY

Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

FURIOUS (0.S.)

Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?

FURIOUS

I was wrong... I need my friends.

SPHINX

Amigo.

FURIOUS

Casanova said that in two days the entire city

would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing

that we could do about it.

BOWLER

What did he mean?

FURIOUS

I dunno.

SHOVELER

Maybe it's time we checked that place out.

RAJA

But how do we get in?

FURIOUS

(after a moment, sounding very Sphinx-like)

We just become like the wolf... who wears the

sheep's clothing.

RAJA

So where's the art?

FURIOUS

He hasn't stolen it yet.

SHOVELER

This place is built like a fortress.

FURIOUS

Because thats what it is.

RAJA

What's that?

FURIOUS

(following the sound)

Come on.

RAJA

(stunned)

Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.

RAJA (O.S.)

The Bone Heads from the South Side...

RAJA (O.S.)

The Bland Boys from Downtown...

RAJA (O.S.)

Italian Ice...

RAJA (O.S.)

The Stapler...

RAJA (0.S.)

The Elvis Brothers.

CASANOVA

Excuse me.

CASANOVA

(reading her name tag)

Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.

CASANOVA

I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I

couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead

ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

MONICA

Really?

CASANOVA

Are you an actress?

MONICA

Just a waitress.

CASANOVA

You underestimate yourself.

CASANOVA

You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little

Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I

think you'd be perfect for.

MONICA

Really?

CASANOVA

I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick

around after the luncheon?

MONICA

Sure--I guess.

CASANOVA

Terrific.

CASANOVA

What are you three doing here? This is invited

guests only.  Out.

RAJA

That was too close.

SHOVELER

But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

FURIOUS

Hey.

FURIOUS

It's me.

MONICA

What are you guys doing here?

RAJA & SHOVELER

Shhhh!

CASANOVA

Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the

cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get

them.

CASANOVA

Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I

WAS YOUR KING!

CASANOVA

(tragically)

But they called me a psycho, and they put me

away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell,

painting watercolors, writing haikus--just

waiting for the day I could take my revenge.

Well, brothers, that day has come!

CASANOVA

They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on

them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on

the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest--

every man, woman, and child in this city is

going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers

will murder their tots!  Old ladies will

strangle their cats!  Children will bump off

their babysitters!

ITALIAN ICE

You're outta your mind!

CASANOVA

I beg your pardon?

ITALIAN ICE

Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.

CASANOVA

Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly

little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow

my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours.

ITALIAN ICE

Done.

CASANOVA

(to Anabel, with a smile)

Honey, give the boys a taste.

CROOKS

That was great!... What the hell was that?...

How did you do that?

CASANOVA

Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be

amplified across this entire city.  Murder and

mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City

will be ours again!  This will be our castle!

And I will be our king!  And there's no one to

stop us!

AMAZING (O.S.)

Not so fast, Casanova!

CASANOVA

Don't worry, fellas...

(moves to Captain Amazing, and

puts his arm chummily around him)

I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.

AMAZING

(in a canned voice)

Isn't my butt cute in these tights?

(pulls again)

Blue is my color.

(pulls again)

Oh, my abs are killing me!

ELVIS BROTHER I

The King is back!

ELVIS BROTHER 2

Long live the King!

MONICA

What could have made such a horrible noise?

HELLER

(after a moment, gravely)

He's got the Psychostridulator.

ALL

The what?

HELLER

Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret

Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a

prototype for a weapon that emitted a

fluctuating alternative frequency noise that

produced a violent psychotic reaction in any

mammal within hearing distance.  But when the

old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its

brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

SHOVELER

This Kopov, what happened to him?

HELLER

Not him... her.

BOWLER

Did she look like that?

HELLER

Yes.

SPLEEN

(hopefully)

Maybe it won't work.

FURIOUS

It works.

HELLER

A village in Siberia was wiped out when a

cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

MONICA

We've got to warn the city.

SHOVELER

How?

RAJA

No one will believe us.

BOWLER

They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

FURIOUS

(after a moment, grimly)

We know what we gotta do.

RAJA

We're outnumbered twenty to one.

SHOVELER

It's suicide.

FURIOUS

Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying.

It's about good versus evil, and we're good,

whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a

little funny...

FURIOUS

And smell a little funny.  We're not

bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're

superheroes--and that means doing what's right-

-even when it's impossible... This is our city-

-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we

don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take

a ride up that hill, blast our way in there,

destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach

those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

SPHINX

Now you're talking.

BOWLER

Sounds good to me.

RAJA

Let's do it.

SHOVELER

And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

MONICA

I just want you guys to know--I may not be a

superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to

help!

ALL

Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  (Etc.)

BOWLER

We could really use some coffee--

SHOVELER

And some sandwiches--

SPLEEN

With mustard!

MONICA

(her feelings a little hurt)

Sure.

RAJA

But that place is huge and we don't know where

this psycho thing is--

BOWLER

Or even what it looks like.

HELLER

And he must have it well hidden.

FURIOUS

We'll just have to get lucky.

FURIOUS

Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here

at sunset... Do or die.

ALL

Do or die.

SPHINX

Victoria o morte.

SALLY

HEY!

SHOVELER

Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a

normal guy.

LUCILLE

I don't want a normal guy.

MOTHER

Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!

RAJA

Mother... it's not what you think!

MOTHER

And why are you wearing that silly costume?

RAJA

(painfully)

Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

RAJA

Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you

wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a

family--but it's just not who I am!

MOTHER

But... the silverware?

RAJA

I use it... to fight evil.

MOTHER

(after a moment)

Jeffrey... this is wonderful.

RAJA

(stunned)

It is?

MOTHER

I always knew that you were special.

RAJA

You did?

MOTHER

Ever since you were a little boy...

(gets an idea, excited)

Come with me.

MOTHER

This is for you.

MOTHER

Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.

RAJA

Bitchin'.

FURIOUS

Try it again!

FURIOUS

Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME

ON!

BOWLER

Mon Capitan, it's for you.

(tosses him the phone)

FURIOUS

Hello?

MONICA

(on a phone, speaking very softly)

It's me.

FURIOUS

Monica, where are you?

MONICA

At the Frankenstein Center.

FURIOUS

Are you nuts?  Get out of there!

MONICA

I'm going inside.

FURIOUS

What are you talking about?

MONICA

Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but

he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just

maybe--I can trick him into showing me the

location of the whatchamathing.

FURIOUS

He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!

MONICA

Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack

as long as you can.  If I can discover the

location I'll call you--

FURIOUS

And what if you get killed?

MONICA

Then at least I will have died trying, right?

MONICA

Roy... We might never see each other again, so

I'd better tell you now...  I think you're

wonderful.

FURIOUS

(caught completely off guard)

What?

MONICA

Bye.

(and she hangs up)

FURIOUS

Monica!

MONICA

Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is

here?

GUARD

Sure, doll.

BOWLER

(worried about him)

Hey... you okay?

FURIOUS

Sure.

MONICA

Hi.

CASANOVA

I thought you'd chickened out on me.

MONICA

Just wanted to... powder my nose.

MONICA

How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

CASANOVA

Why not?

CASANOVA

Big, isn't it?

CASANOVA

Don't worry.  It's not activated.

MONICA

Who's the artist?

CASANOVA

Me.

FURIOUS

Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who

knows it.

FURIOUS

We're all the same really.  Our songs, our

dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt

to live forever.

(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

SPHINX

He is in love.  His anger is gone.

RAJA

Oh no.

SHOVELER

Great timing!

FURIOUS

Has Monica called?

CASANOVA

This is where I come to... be alone.

MONICA

Oh, look at that view.

HELLER

Snap out of it!

BOWLER

Get on to yourself!

SHOVELER

(shouting right in his face)

GET MAD!

FURIOUS

But I just don't feel it.

RAJA

He's turned into a completely normal person!

FURIOUS

Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist?

And if it did, how would we know it?

FURIOUS

You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for.

MONICA

I'm chilly.

SPLEEN

Look!  Your favorite sunglasses!

(snaps them in two)

BOWLER

Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!

(hurls it against the wall)

SHOVELER

Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!

(breaks the head off it)

FURIOUS

Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously

peeved.

CASANOVA

Come here.

MONICA

I'm not that kind of girl.

CASANOVA

Then why are you here?

MONICA

Curiosity.

CASANOVA

(with a smile)

Remember the cat.

ANABEL

What are you doing all alone in the dark?

CASANOVA

Fantasizing... about you.

CASANOVA

I thought you were done?

ANABEL

One last tweak.

RAJA

If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

BOWLER

It's working!

FURIOUS

This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!

SHOVELER

It's time.

RAJA

With or without him, we gotta go!

ANABEL

Our guests are waiting.

CASANOVA

I'll be down in a jiffy.

MONICA

I'd better go.

CASANOVA

You're a spy.

MONICA

(offguard)

What?

CASANOVA

I saw him walk you home.

MONICA

Who?

CASANOVA

Roy.

CASANOVA

Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...

MONICA

Stay away!

CASANOVA

Or you'll what?  CAN ME?

CASANOVA

That bitch!

FURIOUS

But she still might call!

SHOVELER

Are you coming or not?

FURIOUS

I'll drive.

SHOVELER

Not a chance!

MONICA

Come on, guys... Pick up...

CASANOVA'S VOICE

What's the matter...

CASANOVA

Nobody home?

SHOVELER

Here we go!

SHOVELER

We've got lift off!

RAJA

May the forks be with us!

RAJA

First is good.

CASANOVA

I want her alive.

GUARDS

Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.

LITTLE BOY

Daddy, what is that thing?

FATHER

I don't know, son.

DRUNK

A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.

SPHINX

Amigo, we need you.

INVISIBLE BOY

Just GET MAD!

CASANOVA

Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have

gone sane.

(kisses her neck)

GUARD 1

What the hell is that?

GUARD 2

Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.

GUARDS

HEY!

SHOVELER

Hang on!

CASANOVA

It's showtime.

TONY P

What's that?

GUARD

Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked.

CASANOVA

By whom?

VOICE OF GUARD

We don't know!

TONY P

They'll never get through those doors.

SHOVELER

Come on, baby!

BOWLER

Do it, big boy!

SHOVELER

Atta, girl!

BOWLER

Atta, boy!

VOICE OF GUARD

Mr. Frankenstein, they're in!

CASANOVA

Well kill them.

SHOVELER

Where am I going?

RAJA

(pointing to an archway on the

other side of the hall)

Through there!

SHOVELER

Right.

SHOVELER

No good!  She's dead!

TONY P

Spam in a can!

FURIOUS

Cover me!

SHOVELER

With what?

ELVIS BROTHER 1

Who are those guys?

RAJA

Not bad for a normal guy!

SPHINX

Amigos!

ALL

Do or die!

HELLER

Wait!  Look!

HELLER

Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

RAJA

No problem.

TONY P

We'll take care of these clowns.

ELVIS BROTHER 2

Piece a cake.

BONE HEAD LEADER

No sweat.

SHOVELER

Doc, there's got to be a way.

MONICA'S VOICE

It's up here!  It's up here!

FURIOUS

(looks up)

Monica!

MONICA

ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!

CASANOVA

Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have

her back... when I'm done!

HELLER

He'll never make it.

BOWLER

Think positive.

INVISIBLE BOY

(to himself)

I can do it.

CASANOVA

(admiring her)

Some girls just know how to die.

ANABEL

You two timing psychotic bastard.

CASANOVA

Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

ANABEL

(aiming at his heart)

Do I?

CASANOVA

I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women.

It doesn't mean a thing.

(moving toward her, turning on

that old Frankenstein Charm)

Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our

night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated

for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a

trifle... You're the only woman who's ever

meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship

you.  I want to make you my bride.

CASANOVA

There's just one thing...

(with a psychotic smile)

I don't need you anymore.

CASANOVA

Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady.

BOWLER

Heads up!

INVISIBLE BOY

Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!

INVISIBLE BOY

Can you see me?

ALL

Yes!

INVISIBLE BOY

Nuts.

SHOVELER

Kid, turn that thing off!

INVISIBLE BOY

HEY! CREEPS!

SHOVELER

This is it!  DO OR DIE!

CASANOVA

And the light goes out...

FURIOUS (0.S.)

Frankenstein!

CASANOVA

Roy... What took you so long?

CASANOVA

Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.

FURIOUS

They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

CASANOVA

Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?

TONY P

Let's rush 'em!

DISCO BOYS

Help!... Get me out of this!

(Etc.)

RAJA (0.S.)

Gentlemen!

CASANOVA

Roy, you're making this too easy.

TONY P

Say hello to Daddy for me!

BOWLER

(grimly)

Daddy says hello.

CASANOVA

Let's change the tune.

CASANOVA

WHAT A RUSH!

(tosses the remote off the balcony)

FURIOUS

(raspy voiced)

Is... that... all you got?

FURIOUS

Nice dancing with you.

FURIOUS

Monica...

MONICA

You're beautiful when you're angry.

RAJA

Mama!

RAJA

I'm home.

DON

Few details have emerged...

DON (0.S.)

...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive

interview vith two of the suspects.

ELVIS BROTHER I

I don't know who those guys were--but I never

want to see 'em again.

ELVIS BROTHER 2

Especially that big dude with the shovel...

ELVIS BROTHER 1

(near tears)

He was the worst!

KIDS

Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?

SHOVELER

(shocked by this welcome)

I'm okay--I'm all right.

EDDIE JR.

Lean on me, Dad.

LENORE

I'll hold your shovel, Dad.

BUTCH

You want a soda, Dad?

SHOVELER

(stunned)

Okay.

ROLAND

Nice work. Dad.

SHOVELER

Thanks, Roland.

ROLAND

You really are a superhero, aren't you?

SHOVELER

And that's when the engine blew up.

KIDS

Whoa...

BUTCH

What did you do?

SHOVELER

Well...

DOC HELLER

So you're never actually conscious of range or

trajectory?

RAJA

Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.

DAWN

It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly

psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that

left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the

city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the

question remains... Who were these heroic

mystery men who saved our city?...

BOWLER

Could have been anybody.

RAJA

Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name.

We're... the Mystery Men.

BOWLER

Hey, do I look like a Man?

SHOVELER

Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

SPLEEN

(singing, ala "Macho Man")

Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery

Man...

SHOVELER & RAJA

Shut up.

BOWLER

Eat your mustard.

FURIOUS

It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We

know who we are.

RAJA

Yes, Obie-wan.

INVISIBLE BOY

Hey... he's gone.

RAJA

"Until you need me again... Adios."

SHOVELER

I miss him already.

FURIOUS

Amigos, duty calls.

PATRON

Miss... who are those guys?

MONICA

(after a moment)

I don't know.
