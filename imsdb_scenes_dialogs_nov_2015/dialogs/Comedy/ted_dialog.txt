NARRATOR (V.O.)

It has been said that magic vanished from

our world a long time ago. And that

humanity can no longer fulfill its

desires through the power of wishes.

To those who have lost the wondrous

vision of childhood eyes, submitted here

is the story of a little boy, and a

magical Christmas wish that changed his

life forever.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It began in 1985, in a town just outside

Boston.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It was Christmas Eve, and all the

children were in high spirits. That

special time of year when Boston children

gather together and beat up the Jewish

kids.

KID #1

Hey, Greenbaum!

GREENBAUM

Uh oh.

KID #1

It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know

what I'm gonna get him?

GREENBAUM

W...what?

(CONTINUED)

2

CONTINUED:

KID #1

My fist in your fuckin' face!

GREENBAUM

Why would Jesus want that?

KID #2

Get him!

NARRATOR (V.O.)

But there was one child who wasn't in

such good spirits. Little John Bennett.

That one boy in every neighborhood who

just has a tough time making friends.

JOHN

Hey guys, can I play?

KID #1/#2/#3

Get outta here! / Get outta here,

Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!

GREENBAUM

Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John longed with all his heart for that

one true friend that he could call his

own. And he knew that if he ever found

that friend, he would never let him go.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Well, as it does every year, Christmas

morning finally came.

CONTINUED:

NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)

All the children were opening their gifts

with holiday glee.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

And for little John Bennett, Christmas

Day brought a very special new arrival.

JOHN

Wow!

JOHN'S DAD

I guess Santa paid attention to how good

you were this year, huh?

JOHN'S MOM

(KISSING HIM)

Merry Christmas, John.

(CONTINUED)

4

CONTINUED:

JOHN

He talks!

JOHN (CONT'D)

I'm gonna name you Teddy.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John became instantly attached to Teddy.

There was something about that bear that

made him feel as if he finally had a

friend with whom he could share his

deepest secrets.

JOHN

Hey Teddy... can I tell you something

nobody knows?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Last week, my mom and dad took me to the

park for a picnic. And they have this

duck pond there, and... when nobody was

looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it

at a duck. Was that mean?

JOHN (CONT'D)

(HUGGING HIM)

I love you too, Teddy!

JOHN (CONT'D)

You know... I wish you could really talk

to me. Because then we could be best

friends forever and ever.

(CONTINUED)

5

CONTINUED:

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Now, if there's one thing you can be sure

of... it's that nothing is more powerful

than a young boy's wish.

(BEAT)

Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache

helicopter has machine guns and missiles.

It is an unbelievably impressive

complement of weaponry. An absolute

death machine. Well, as it turned out,

John picked the perfect night to make a

wish.

DISSOLVE TO:

JOHN

Teddy?

(beat, a bit more concerned)

Teddy?!

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

JOHN (CONT'D)

Teddy?

TEDDY

Hug me.

JOHN

Did you... did you just talk?

TEDDY

You're my best friend, John.

JOHN

(BEAT)

You're alive?!

TEDDY

Uh-huh.

JOHN

Whoa...

TEDDY

Don't look so surprised. You're the one

who wished for it, aren't you?

JOHN

Yeah, I... I did wish for it.

TEDDY

Well, here I am.

JOHN

You mean... we get to be best friends...

for real?

TEDDY

For real.

JOHN

Forever and ever?

(CONTINUED)

7

CONTINUED:

TEDDY

Sounds good to me.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

John was just about the happiest boy in

the world. And he couldn't wait to tell

everyone the good news.

JOHN'S MOM

Well, I think we had a wonderful

Christmas this year.

JOHN'S DAD

One of the best.

(SLYLY)

And I particularly enjoyed the gift you

gave me last night.

JOHN

Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's

alive!

JOHN'S MOM

(PLAYING ALONG)

Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting.

JOHN

No mom, he's alive! For real! Look!

TEDDY

Merry Christmas, everybody!

JOHN'S DAD

Jesus H. Fuck!

(CONTINUED)

8

CONTINUED:

TEDDY

Let's all be best friends!

JOHN'S MOM

Oh my god...

JOHN'S DAD

John, get away from that thing! Come

over here, right now!

JOHN

BUT DAD--

JOHN'S DAD

GET OVER HERE!

JOHN'S DAD (CONT'D)

Helen, get my gun.

JOHN

Dad, no!

TEDDY

Is it a hugging gun?

JOHN'S DAD

Helen, get my gun, and call the police!

TEDDY

I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to

scare anybody. I just wanted John and I

to be friends.

JOHN

Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that

Teddy was alive, and my wish came true!

JOHN'S MOM

(ASTONISHED WHISPER)

My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A

Christmas miracle.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Well, it wasn't long before the story of

John's little miracle was sweeping the

nation.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV)

We see an 80's NEWSCASTER behind the news desk. A

graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder.

NEWSCASTER

Out of a Boston suburb comes what is,

without a doubt, the most incredible

story in the history of broadcast news...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DIFFERENT NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV)

We see an 80's FEMALE NEWSCASTER. A graphic of the bear

is over her left shoulder.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER

...young boy's stuffed animal has

magically come to life for as yet unknown

reasons. Scientists are stumped as to

how...

We see a `70S SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER with a CHYRON that says

"ACTION NEWS GEORGIA". He points manically at the

graphic of the bear above his left shoulder.

SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER

Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus

did! Look what Jesus did!

INT. JAPANESE NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV)

A MALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER and FEMALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER

sit behind the desk. Between them, at the top of the

screen, is a picture of the bear.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER

(SPEAKS JAPANESE FOR A FEW MOMENTS)

The male newscaster turns sharply to her.

MALE NEWSCASTER

(ADDRESSES HER ANGRILY IN JAPANESE)

He strikes her for an unclear reason. She buries her

head in her hands, in shame.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Before long, Teddy had become a huge

celebrity in his own right.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

But through all the fame, Teddy never

forgot his very best friend, John.

JOHN (O.S., UNDER COVERS)

The thunder can't get us, right?

TEDDY (O.S., UNDER COVERS)

Nope. We're thunder buddies. And the

thunder knows it. We're totally safe.

JOHN

Teddy?

TEDDY

Yeah, John?

JOHN

Do you promise we'll always be together?

TEDDY

I promise.

TEDDY (CONT'D)

Thunder buddies for life.

JOHN

Thunder buddies for life.

(CONTINUED)

11

CONTINUED:

NARRATOR (V.O.)

And that was a promise that neither one

of them ever forgot.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

So where are John and Teddy today? Well,

let me put it this way: no matter how big

a splash you make in this world, whether

you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz,

Justin Bieber, or a talking teddy bear,

eventually nobody gives a shit.

SMASH CUT TO:

TED

All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are,

on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than

women from the elsewheres of life.

JOHN

That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's

hot.

TED

Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston

girl.

(CONTINUED)

16

CONTINUED:

JOHN

They're not that bad.

TED

The fact that you have to say they're not

that bad means that they are that bad.

They turn into drunk, half-white, half-

pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach.

TED (CONT'D)

(COUGHS)

Jesus, this is weak. It's not even

gettin' me high. I gotta have a talk

with my weed guy.

JOHN

I-- It's workin' for me.

TED

I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk

with him.

JOHN

Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a

drug dealer with complaints.

TED

No, I know this guy a long time. I've

known him since 9/11. Remember, I was

like, "Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get

high."

JOHN

(looks at his watch)

Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I

gotta get to work.

TED

Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on

the way home? I wanna start enjoying the

beauty of birds.

JOHN (O.S.)

Jesus, I don't know if I can drive.

TED

I'll drive you, I feel fine.

JOHN/TED

Aw, Jesus. / Fuck.

JOHN

Aw, man.

TED

Is it bad?

JOHN

It's not good.

THOMAS

John! May I speak with you, please?

JOHN

Shit.

TED

It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here.

Easy, Jersey license!

THOMAS

John, it's almost ten o'clock.

JOHN

I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault.

THOMAS

What do you mean?

JOHN

(BEAT)

I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a

follow-up question.

THOMAS

John, all you have to do is not fuck up,

and you get my job when I go to corporate

next month. You will be the new branch

manager. All you have to do is not fuck

up, and all you're doing is fucking up.

Not that I don't think you're too fucked

up to handle not fucking up my job, but

you happen to be the least fucked-up

person in the whole office. The next

least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been

here three fucking years longer than him.

But I'm telling you, I will promote the

fuck out of him if you fuck up one more

time. That is all. Fuck.

JOHN

Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret

promoting the fuck out of me.

THOMAS

Good. I like hearing that. Because in a

month my life now could be your life: a

cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's

personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's

not a bad life, is it?

JOHN

N--no.

(CONTINUED)

19

CONTINUED:

THOMAS

Did you know I'm friends with Tom

Skerritt?

JOHN

No.

THOMAS

I'll show you something I don't show too

many people, because I don't want anyone

treating me differently.

THOMAS (CONT'D)

That's me and Tom Skerritt.

JOHN

(SLIGHTLY OVERDONE)

Wowwww.

THOMAS

Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here.

I'm gonna dock you for being late, and

for the scratch on that car. Try and be

a little more responsible tomorrow.

JOHN

I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you

down, Goose.

THOMAS

What?

JOHN

Top Gun.

So?

HUSBAND/WIFE

Thank you./Thanks so much.

GUY

Hey, heard you got busted.

JOHN

Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what

happened?

GUY

I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted

last night, and my phone says I texted

somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me

up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same

person saying thanks.

JOHN

And you don't remember it?

GUY

No. Same as last time.

JOHN

It... it just seems gay, doesn't it?

GUY

I don't know. Maybe, yeah.

JOHN

Do you think you're part of some, like,

gay beat-up underworld? Like one of

those gay beat-up clubs?

GUY

I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't

remember any of it, I was so fucked up.

I might be gay, I don't know. You mind

covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go

lay down in the john.

Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging?

GUY/JOHN

Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last

night?

ALIX

Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer

was doucheface, but I made friends in the

line.

GUY

Oh, well, that's good I guess.

TANYA

Hi you guys.

ALIX

You look so pretty today.

TANYA

Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this

morning.

ALIX

I can tell, you are less fat than you

have been.

JOHN

Hey guys, does anybody know a nice

restaurant? Like something where the

napkins are cloth?

For what?

Lori and I have been dating four years

tomorrow, and I wanted to take her

someplace nice.

like six months, and then she farted in

her sleep. I'm like, I am outta here,

man. Was gone before she woke up.

JOHN

Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh.

GUY

Lori ever fart in front of you?

JOHN

Yes.

GUY

Really.

JOHN

Yes. Many times.

GUY

You Italian?

JOHN

No.

GUY

Oh.

JOHN

Why?

GUY

I dunno, just seems like-- never mind,

take her to Benihana.

TANYA

Don't you think after four years, maybe

she's probably hoping for something more

than dinner?

JOHN

Like what?

(CONTINUED)

23

CONTINUED:

TANYA

Well, if I were her, I'd be expecting a

proposal.

JOHN

Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to

propose. Marriage isn't... I mean, isn't

love enough? I submit that love is

enough.

GUY

You could put the ring in her ass and let

her fart it out.

JOHN

So bad, but so good.

TED

Yes, a study in contrasts.

JOHN

Oh, I love this part.

something... big, do you?

TED

What, like anal?

JOHN

No, like... a circular gold thing on the

TED

Oh, fuck that! It's four years! You and

I have been together 27 years!

TED (CONT'D)

Where's my ring, Johnny? Where's my

ring, asshole?

JOHN

Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off!

JOHN (CONT'D)

I mean, do you think she might be

expecting me to make that kinda move?

TED

No, John. It's a bad idea. And it's the

wrong time. What with the economy and...

the credit bubble... the Supreme Court...

I mean, look at Haiti.

She's a comedienne.

Oh nice. Is she pretty?

JOHN

She's as pretty as she is funny. How was

work?

LORI

Good.

JOHN

How's your dickhead boss?

LORI

Rex is fine. He only hit on me once

today, so that's good.

JOHN

I'm not saying this to be mean, but I

really hope that fucker gets leukemia.

LORI

He's harmless, I can handle it.

TED

Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a

beer, huh?

JOHN

(crossing to fridge)

Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis?

Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice

right about now.

LORI

Jesus.

TED

Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?

LORI

Y'know, I think I might also have a

Martina Navra-ti-brewski.

JOHN/TED

Ohhhh, that doesn't work!/Come on, don't

ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work.

LORI

Bullshit, what do you mean?

JOHN

It doesn't work, the name has to have a

"ski" at the end of it. You just put

"brewski" on the end of Martina

Navratolova.

LORI

I thought we were just doing funny names.

TED

No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end.

Otherwise where's the challenge? If

there's no "ski" at the end of the root

word, then we would just be idiots saying

nonsense.

LORI

(OFF IPAD)

Oh, look, they found those missing

hikers.

JOHN

They did? What happened?

LORI

It says they got separated and one of

them had his foot trapped under a rock

for five days.

(CONTINUED)

28

CONTINUED:

JOHN

You know, if your leg got trapped under a

rock, I'd chew it off to get you free.

LORI

(SWEETLY)

You would?

JOHN

I sure would.

(BEAT)

Is that cannibalism?

LORI

No, I think it's only cannibalism if you

swallow.

JOHN

Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow.

LORI

Really? That's not what I heard about

you.

JOHN

It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy

broad.

LORI

(LAUGHS AGAIN)

I can see that.

(THEN)

Y'know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella's

a really expensive restaurant. If you

want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow

night. I don't care, as long as we're

together.

JOHN

You kiddin' me? Four years we been going

out, I'm takin' you to the best place in

town. I been crappin' out room for it

for two days, I know exactly what I'm

gonna order.

LORI

You're disgusting.

I love you, too.

JOHN

Ah, come on!

LORI

I don't understand it, 35 years old, and

you're still scared of a little thunder.

JOHN

I am not.

boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm

without his teddy bear.

GINA

I don't understand why you keep putting

up with him.

TRACY

Yeah, I mean, the guy's thirty-five years

old and he's working for a rental car

service.

LORI

No, it's not that, I don't care about

that. I'd love him even if he was a

janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart,

we laugh together all the time, and it's

just a bonus that he's like the hottest

guy in Boston.

GINA

Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is

like being the classiest Kardashian.

LORI

I just wish he could get his life

together, you know? Our life. And he

can't, and I swear to god, it's all

because of that bear.

MICHELLE

Oh come on, you don't really think that.

LORI

Not really, but what if?

MICHELLE

Well then... things happen for a reason.

TRACY

No they don't. That's just something

girls say when something bad happens to

them that they don't understand.

GINA

Fuck off, Tracy.

Well hello there. Sorry if I'm

GINA

TRACY

Well, I didn't want one of you whores

LORI

So... what do you need to talk to me

about, Rex?

REX

See that? That's me on the diving team

in high school. We dove the shit outta

that pool that year. If you look close,

you can see the outline of my root.

LORI

(ANNOYED)

You promised this was about work.

REX

Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't

you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking,

my dad owns the company--

Ooh, Cristal.

It's a special night. We've been dating

can't be wrong, right?

LORI

It doesn't seem like four years, does it?

JOHN

(affectionately taking her

HAND)

No, it doesn't.

sorry!

LORI

Well, yeah, I... I would hope it was an

accident.

JOHN

Did you hurt your head?

LORI

Um, yes. My head hurts a lot.

JOHN

Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice.

Sorry. Does it hurt?

FIRST TIME)

N... No. No it's okay.

JOHN

(beat, noticing too)

I'm... I'm John.

LORI

I'm Lori.

LORI

Okay, here's a question that'll show how

much you actually care about me. You

remember we stayed and talked until the

place closed, and then we went for late

night eggs and waffles, and we stayed

there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the

little TV in the diner. Name the movie.

doubt.

JOHN

Thank you. And by the way, my dancing

was not that bad.

LORI

(LAUGHING)

Your dancing was bad.

JOHN

I had some cool moves.

clear violation of the "no gift" rule.

LORI

There was no such rule.

JOHN

Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for

a long time.

LORI

Oh, John.

JOHN

Those are the ones you liked, right?

From that kiosk at the mall?

LORI

Oh. Yeah.

JOHN

Check out the card.

JOHN (CONT'D)

See, I even wrote the words with

different colored markers so you wouldn't

get bored while you were reading it.

LORI

(UNENTHUSED)

Great. Thanks. Well, um, here. This is

for you.

JOHN

(OPENS BOX)

Oh wow, a Hamilton!

LORI

I remember you liked it when you saw Tom

Brady wearing one in GQ.

JOHN

Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is

so awesome, I love it!

JOHN (CONT'D)

Y'know, Lori...

(INDICATING BOX)

Someday, there's gonna be a ring in

there. But I wanna wait `til I can get

you something really special, y'know? I

just don't have the money right now.

LORI

John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all

I want is--

JOHN

I know, but it's important to me that you

have the engagement ring you deserve.

And what with the credit bubble... the

Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.

LORI

Look, I'm only saying this because I love

you, but that's not realistic. You're

never gonna have any kind of a career if

you're always partying and wasting time

with Ted.

JOHN

Oh, Jesus, here we go--

LORI

John, please get him to find his own

place, so we can get on with our lives.

JOHN

Look, can we talk about this another

time, and just enjoy our anniversary

dinner?

(CONTINUED)

39

CONTINUED:

LORI

Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten

years from now.

JOHN

(rolling his eyes with a

SIGH)

Lori, we can't talk about this every time

we go out. Look, he's been my best

friend since I was eight. And I was not

a popular child. You have to understand,

I had no friends before he came along.

He's the only reason I ever gained any

fucking confidence. I coulda wound up

like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but

I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know,

I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick

him out.

LORI

Well, it's good to know that a talking

teddy bear is the only thing that kept

you from gunning down your classmates,

but John, you're not eight. You're

thirty-five. And unless you're too blind

to notice, he's not your only friend

anymore. You have me. And I love you.

JOHN

I love you, too. You know that.

LORI

Look, I've put the best physical years of

my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now,

but in a few years my body's gonna fall

off a fucking cliff. Things'll be

hanging and stretching in ways that might

scare a man. I need to feel secure in

the fact that you won't leave me when

that happens.

JOHN

Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna

be even better. `Cause I can have sex

with you, and press your arm fat against

a comic book so I can see it backwards.

LORI

And, my boobs and vagina will all be in

the same place, so that's a lot less

movin' around for you.

(CONTINUED)

40

CONTINUED:

JOHN

I can do it all with one hand.

LORI

Exactly, and you can do whatever you want

with the other hand.

JOHN

I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.

LORI

We can achieve critical acclaim and

become rich just by screwing each other.

JOHN

Well, I hope these jokes have distracted

you from the actual problems in our

relationship.

LORI

(SIGH)

We can't put the real conversation off

forever, John.

JOHN

I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes.

JOHN

(NOTICING)

Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the

seat somewhere. Can you call it?

LORI

That's my ringtone?

JOHN

(laughs, embarrassed)

Oh, yeah...

LORI

What is it? It sounds negative.

(CONTINUED)

41

CONTINUED:

JOHN

No, it's from The Notebook.

JOHN (CONT'D)

(STRAINING)

This is gonna take some doin'.

LORI

All right, well I'll see you upstairs.

LORI

What the hell is all this?!

TED

Lori! Hey, you're home early! The

ladies and I were just watching

"Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu-

Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of

the Nile," but I don't know that we'll

end up watchin' that one.

LORI

This place is a wreck! Who are these

girls?

TED

Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is

Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and

Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls.

Y'know, somewhere out there are four

terrible fathers I wish I could thank for

this great night.

(CONTINUED)

42

LORI

What is that?!!!

TED

What's what?

LORI

There is... a shit in the corner! On the

floor! There's a shit!

TED

(LOOKING OVER)

Oh man, that's what Dierdre was doin'

over there in the corner for so long.

Remember, she was crouched over there and

I thought she was just makin' a call or

SOMETHIN'--

LORI

There is a shit!! On my floor!!

TED

Yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom

now, she seemed like she was hopped up on

somethin'. I mean, mystery solved, I

GUESS--

LORI

What the fuck!!!!

TED

Lori, if I can-- now this is just

speculation, but... is it possible that

this is not so much about the stool in

the corner, and more about maybe

tonight's dinner not measuring up to your

expectations?

LORI

What!!! The fuck!!!

JOHN (V.O.)

RAAARRRR!!

TED

(POINTING)

Ahaaaaa!

money!

TED

(TO GIRL)

Hahaaa! That's my friend John. Not the

lobster, the guy runnin' it.

JOHN

Found my phone.

JOHN (CONT'D)

What's goin' on?

(then, noticing)

Is that a shit?

TED

God, there are some fucked up fish out

there.

JOHN

Yeah.

TED

Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough

guy fish.

(tough guy voice:)

"Hey! Whatsa big idea? Cold fusion?

Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!"

Look at that guy. WASP-y white guy fish.

JOHN

Ted... you gotta move out.

TED

Wh... what?

JOHN

It's... it's gotta happen.

TED

What...what did I do?

JOHN

Ted, my relationship is at a very

delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I

may just need a little space right now.

Plus a hooker took a shit in our

apartment.

TED

Hey, look, that was a tough night for all

of us.

LORI

Oh, god!!

JOHN

Aaaa, what?!

LORI

It's so gross!!

JOHN

Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about

it! Did you get it?

LORI

No! Oh my god!

JOHN

Tell me when you get it!

LORI

AAAA, I got some on my thumb!

JOHN

AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand

again! I'm serious, learn to cook other-

handed!

LORI

Shit!

JOHN

I'll get the next one, okay?

TED

She's makin' you do it, isn't she?

JOHN

(giving up the bullshit)

Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't

hang out. We'll hang out all the time!

TED

What about... thunder buddies for life,

Johnny?

JOHN

I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to

do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise

I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her,

Ted.

TED

(SIGH)

I know you do, Johnny.

(CONTINUED)

46

JOHN

I'll help you get on your feet out there,

I promise.

TED

And we'll hang out a lot, right?

JOHN

Fuck, all the time.

TED

Bring it over here.

TED (CONT'D) JOHN

JOHN

We've got to get you a job.

TED

I look stupid.

JOHN

No, you don't. You look dapper.

TED

I look like Snuggles' accountant.

JOHN

some money so you can pay for an

apartment.

TED

I don't wanna work at a grocery store.

(CONTINUED)

47

CONTINUED:

JOHN

Well, you have no skills.

TED

I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.

JOHN

As I said, you would need a law degree

from a law school.

TED

I'm a special case. I'm a fucking

talking bear. They might make an

exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa!

This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's

give him a job and maybe he'll give us a

few laughs," but then they're surprised

at what a stellar performance I'm turnin'

in. And then they practically have to

give me the Anderson case.

JOHN

Look, you get the job, and we'll

celebrate after.

TED

And if I don't get the job will we still

smoke that pot?

JOHN

Probably, yes.

TED

(patting John on the leg)

Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach.

FRANK

So. You think you got what it takes?

TED

Nope.

FRANK

(a beat, then)

No one's ever talked to me like that

before. You're hired.

TED

Shit.

TED

Well, I'm a former celebrity with a

minimum wage job. This must be what the

cast of Different Strokes feels like.

O.S. VOICE

Excuse me.

DONNY

I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I

couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.

JOHN

(a little uncomfortable)

Oh. Um, thank you.

DONNY

I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert.

I have to tell you, I've been fascinated

by your story ever since I was a boy. I

remember seeing you on the Carson show.

You were just wonderful.

(CONTINUED)

49

CONTINUED:

TED

Yeah, that was ah... that was a good

time.

DONNY

(TO JOHN)

I wonder, is there any chance I could

purchase the bear from you? For my son?

JOHN/TED

Huh? / Excuse me?

ROBERT

(CALM)

I want it.

TED

Hey, I'm not an "it", pal. I'm a "he."

JOHN

(leaning down to his level)

I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't

for sale. I've had him since I was about

your age. He's very special to me.

ROBERT

Sit up straight when you talk to me.

JOHN

(RECOILING)

Ew, why the fuck did he say that?

DONNY

Don't swear in front of my child. Now.

We are very interested in the bear. If

you'd like to work out some sort of

arrangement, here's my address and phone

number.

JOHN

Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the

really important pocket for really

important stuff.

TED

Wow. Can you imagine what that little

shit would do to me?

(CONTINUED)

JOHN

Oh man, I can totally see him just taking

you down to the basement and really

slowly de-limbing you while singing some

creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.

JOHN (CONT'D)

OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE

SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN

MY LIFE.

TED

Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so

far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for

that. C'mon, let's go find a better

place to get stoned.

JOHN

Well... I guess this is it, huh?

TED

Yeah, sure is.

JOHN

First night on your own.

TED

Yeah. First night in my beautiful new

apartment. They say they're ain't hardly

been no murders here.

JOHN

Okay... so... if you need anything...

TED

I know.

JOHN

Seriously, anything...

TED

I know. I'll be fine, Johnny.

JOHN

(BEAT)

I know you will, buddy.

LORI

Hey there.

JOHN

Hey.

LORI

Listen... I just wanna say thank you.

What you did with Ted was a big step, and

I know it wasn't easy, but I just want

you to know that I love you for it. And,

I think this a new beginning for our

relationship.

JOHN

Hey, anything for you. This is all part

of the new grown up, adult John Bennett.

So, get used to him.

LORI

Y'know, I don't have to be at work for

another twenty minutes...

JOHN

(guiding her down onto the

COUCH)

Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need

one.

(CONTINUED)

52

CONTINUED:

LORI

You know what my favorite thing about you

is? After four years, you can still

surprise me. To step up and change such

a big part of your life just to make your

girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you

most guys couldn't do it.

JOHN

Most guys don't have you to motivate `em.

LORI

I'm sorry if I was pushy about it...

JOHN

No, you were right! Look, the reason I

love you so much is the same reason I

guess I take you for granted sometimes.

It's `cause you're... inevitable.

LORI

(huh?)

Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I

think?

JOHN

No, what I mean is, there's just no

version of this universe where you and I

don't end up together. You're

inevitable.

LORI

That sounds like something Stephen

Hawking would say to his girlfriend.

JOHN

But do you get what I'm saying?

LORI

Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same

way about you.

LORI (CONT'D)

(smiling coyly, as she

NOTICES)

Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in

your pocket or are you glad to see me?

53

TED

Thank you, please come again, we have a

lot more groceries.

TED (CONT'D)

Hey Ellen?

ELLEN

Yeah?

TED

Who's that over there?

ELLEN

That's the new bag girl. I don't know

her name, but she seems cute.

TED

Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like

to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty

Fozzie.

TED (CONT'D)

(TO HIMSELF)

Okay, so that's where we'll draw the

line.

54

TANYA

Hey. How you holding up?

JOHN

Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used

to things, that's all.

TANYA

It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went

through something like this with my last

boyfriend.

JOHN

Really?

TANYA

Yeah, we were dating for eight months,

and I was really in love with him, and

then he was deported back to Iran. So, I

get it.

JOHN

Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost

our furry little guy.

TANYA

Yeah.

JOHN

Hey, Ted.

TED (V.O.)

Johnny. What are you doin'? You wanna

come over and catch a buzz?

JOHN

I could probably swing by after work.

TED (V.O.)

Fuck that, I traded off yesterday, so I

got the night shift. C'mon, I'm bored as

crap over here, just swing by for a bit.

(CONTINUED)

55

JOHN

I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm

trying to get my shit together and be an

adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake.

TED

John. Five minutes. And then I'll kick

you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up

the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly

everybody talks shit about each other in

the interviews.

JOHN

Really?

TED

Yeah, and apparently George Wendt

confesses to a rape.

JOHN

(BEAT)

Sometimes adults get high.

TED

They do, John. Sometimes they do.

JOHN

You'll kick me out in five.

TED (V.O.)

John, I have to kick you out. I am

extraordinarily busy today, I have so

much teddy bear paperwork to get through,

it is retarded. Five minutes and you're

outta here.

JOHN

What do I tell Thomas?

TED

Just tell him you don't feel well.

56

JOHN

I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried

to break up a dog fight, and I guess she

got hurt pretty bad.

THOMAS

Oh my god.

JOHN

Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she

sees trouble, she tries to help out, and

I guess one of these dogs clamped his

jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let

go until the fireman showed up and had to

stick his finger in his ass.

THOMAS

Jesus, John.

JOHN

Yeah, she's pretty shook up.

THOMAS

Oh my god.

(BEAT)

Up the dog's ass, right?

JOHN

Yeah, that's how they--

THOMAS

That's how they get `em to stop biting,

sure.

JOHN

Yeah.

THOMAS

Go go go, take care of it, let me know

how she is.

Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.

You don't owe me anything, go.

Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"?

Hm. Lemme figure out the best way to

answer that. Um...are there naked dicks

in gay porn?

(LAUGHS WARMLY)

Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I

mean, it was the eighties. And I was

king. I was king of the eighties. I was

Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I

was Sam fucking Mayday Malone. Was I

popular? Gee, lemme think: are there

naked dicks in gay porn?

Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what

it refers to. Decisions under pressure.

Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it

up.

JOHN

Y'know, this place looks great.

TED

Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole

apartment for 47 dollars.

Sucks.

pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we

couldn't go and I was all upset, but then

she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up

getting to go skydiving, and it was so

scary but it was so much fun.

Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped

through the cracks.

Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we

were talking about... how... neat all of

Lori's shoes are?

look like unsteady horses when they wear

high heels, but Lori has a sort of...

regal... trot.

girl that can snatch him up.

Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did

Hey, dude, you think you could open more

FRANK

There's supposed to be three registers

open, for god's sake!

FRANK

You had sexual intercourse with a

Yes.

DONNY

You know, Robert and I could give you a

very, very good home.

TED

I'm... I'm pretty happy where I am. I

just got a shitty new apartment--

DONNY

I can offer you six thousand dollars in

railroad bonds. They were left to me by

my father.

TED

Well, gosh, you know, since I just

returned from active duty in the Civil

War, that sounds really appealing. Oh

wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty

years ago, and I don't give a shit.

TAMI-LYNN

Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop

tarts and cigarettes with my mom before

she goes to work.

TED

Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart.

(TO DONNY)

Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I'm

gonna have to decline.

DONNY

I really wish you wouldn't...

Yeah, sorry. But, ah... you know, I'd

like to thank you for creepin' up my

night, and... Jesus be with you. In

Christ.

LORI

I'm glad you're here.

Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your

workplace chemistry, will it?

LORI

Play nice. Please.

There she is! I was worried you weren't

coming!

so bad. That some people have it worse

than me. I mean, he's only got one ball,

and I have three. One of them, of

course, being his.

JOHN

That's inspiring. You've led a rich

life.

REX

I've fucked the shit outta life.

So talk to me, Goose. How are things

with you and Lori?

JOHN

Things are great, actually.

REX

That's good, that's good.

JOHN

You know... Lori would hate me for saying

this, but... she's told me how you are at

the office, and... as one gentleman to

another, I just wanna say I really hope

you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.

REX

Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta

just clear the air here a little. I...

just want you to know that... I mean,

yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and

whatnot, but... look man, I do that with

everybody at the office! I'm just a

kook! I have no designs on your

girlfriend. We work together, and that's

it. I think you're a great guy and she's

very lucky.

Hatch Shell.

You're un-fucking-believable, you know

that? How stupid do you think I am?

First of all, Lori would never go out

with Rex, and second of all, if you think

me for years to stay eternally eight

years old at the expense of the rest of

my life?

Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't

care enough about your relationship.

You can't stand there and tell me you

DONNY

Hi, Ted.

TED

Fuck.

JOHN

Lori! What-- what are you doing here?

LORI

You can thank Ted.

LORI (CONT'D)

How are you?

JOHN

Good, good. I've, uh... made myself a

nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up

the street. I'd show you around, but

it's kinda classy. They require an

undershirt and at least one visible cold

sore for all customers.

(CONTINUED)

103

CONTINUED:

LORI

(LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY)

Well. Shall I sit?

JOHN

Uh, yeah.

JOHN (CONT'D)

So, work's good? Everything good there?

LORI

Yeah. Work's fine.

JOHN

How's Rex?

LORI

There is no Rex.

JOHN

Oh. Good.

(BEAT)

Well... I guess we can't make small talk

all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I

could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it

was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm

ready to change. But I don't think you

wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not

gonna try and get you to take me back.

Why would you? I've been a really shitty

boyfriend for the last four years. I

don't deserve you. I didn't take our

relationship seriously, even though I

love you more than life itself. All I

want is... just to end on good terms.

Because I owe that to you. I want you to

be happy... and for us to be friends.

LORI

(a little taken aback)

Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that.

JOHN

Well. That's pretty much it.

104

TED

Whoa...

DONNY

Yes, as you can see, you've been part of

our family for quite some time. Welcome

home.

TED

Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got

tons of pictures of you guys at my house.

ROBERT

Daddy, is he all mine?

DONNY

He's all yours, my little winner.

You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted.

It's almost Robert's play hour.

TED

I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3.

I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden

horse with a wig kinda family.

TED

Huh. Wig horse.

(CONTINUED)

105

CONTINUED:

DONNY

Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert

now. So you will do as he says.

TED

Y'know, you think you're just gonna get

away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin'

example you're settin' for your kid.

DONNY

(leaning in to Ted with

ANGER)

LANGUAGE!!!

DONNY (CONT'D)

When I was a little boy, I saw you on

television. And I thought you were the

most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd

ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father

if I could have a magical teddy bear,

too. And he said no. And I was

heartbroken. I decided that if I ever

had a son, I would never say no to him.

TED

Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once

in awhile wouldn't hurt.

ROBERT

Me and Ted are gonna be best friends,

daddy.

DONNY

Yes. You are. Happy play time.

TED

Jesus fucking Christ!

ROBERT

No! Daddy said no bad words!

TED

Yeah well, fuck your dad.

TED (CONT'D)

Shit!

(CONTINUED)

106

CONTINUED:

ROBERT

I said a bad word one time, and daddy

punished me for it.

TED

That's a great story, I felt like I was

there.

ROBERT

Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to

give you an ouch.

TED

Okay... okay, kid. You win. We'll do it

your way. You wanna play a game or

somethin'? It's play time, let's play a

game.

ROBERT

Yeah, I wanna play a game!

TED

Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a

little game of hide and seek?

ROBERT

I love hide and seek! I'll hide!

TED

Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to

show good manners, right?

ROBERT

Yes.

TED

Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest

hide first, don't ya think?

ROBERT

Okay, you hide first.

TED

Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count

to a hundred and then try to find me,

okay?

(CONTINUED)

107

CONTINUED:

ROBERT

Do I need to wash my hands before this

game?

TED

You... well-- no, you-- god, that's a

weird fuckin' question, no, just start

countin'.

ROBERT

One... two... three...

TED

Okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid

cancer.

DONNY

(BEAT)

Robert? How's play time?

ROBERT

Good, daddy!

108

DONNY

Ted, are you making friends with Robert?

DONNY (CONT'D)

Ted?

ROBERT (O.S.)

Daddy, you're gonna ruin the game!

DONNY

(CHUCKLING)

Okay.

LORI

Hey.

JOHN

Hey.

(CONTINUED)

109

CONTINUED:

LORI

Kinda late to be walkin' home by

yourself.

JOHN

Oh, I'll be okay. If I get raped, it'll

be my fault with what I'm wearing.

LORI

Listen, John... there's something I wanna

say to you, too.

JOHN

Go ahead.

LORI

John, I just want you to know that... I

mean, I hope you don't think that--

LORI (CONT'D)

I, um... I just feel like we should...

keep talking. Because--

JOHN

Whoever this is, it's not a good time.

TED

John! It's me! Can you hear me?

JOHN

Ted?

JOHN (CONT'D)

Listen, I gotta call you back.

(CONTINUED)

110

CONTINUED:

TED

No, John! Don't hang up, I'm in trouble!

JOHN

What do you mean, what kinda trouble?

TED

They got me! That freaky guy and his

freaky fat kid!

JOHN

What?

TED

I'm in their house, John! You gotta call

the police, they won't let me outta here!

They tore my ear off!

JOHN

Wait, slow down! Where are you?

TED

Uh... I'm not sure, it's uh--

DONNY

(dark, brewing rage)

You're not a very polite guest.

TED

Shit.

JOHN

Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted!

LORI

What's the matter, is he all right?

JOHN

I don't know.

LORI

Where is he?

JOHN

I don't know, but he's in trouble.

(CONTINUED)

111

CONTINUED:

LORI

Why? What happened? Can you call him

back?

JOHN

No, it's blocked-- wait a second.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on

the expressway!

DONNY

You've put us in a pickle here, haven't

you? We have to go now.

TED

Yeah, good idea.

(CONTINUED)

112

CONTINUED:

TED

AAAAAA!

DONNY

We tried to make do with other teddy

bears. But none of them were you, Ted.

JOHN

It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants

Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They

got him somehow.

LORI

Which way?

JOHN

Shoot up 99!

113

JOHN

No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're

gonna be okay.

TED

I... I don't think so. I'm... I'm in

trouble. I need... I need to tell you

something.

JOHN

JOHN

You're back!

TED

(RETARDED-SOUNDING VOICE)

Yeah! I mean, when you sewed me up, you

put some of the stuffing in the wrong

places, so I'm a little fucked up. Will

you take care of me forever and ever?

TED (CONT'D)

(NORMAL VOICE)

Nah, I'm just kiddin' ya, I thought it'd

be funny if you thought I was fuckin'

retarded.

JOHN

You asshole!

LORI

Welcome back, Ted.

JOHN

It... it was you. You did it. (cover

this line with addition:) It was your

wish.

TEDDY

Son of a bitch...You wished for my life

back.

LORI

No. I wished for my life back. Because

I love you both.

TED

You were pretty great out there at

Fenway, Johnny.

LORI

Yeah, that's my big brave man.

JOHN

Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was

punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I

mean if that's what it's like to hit a

woman, watch out, I liked it.

LORI

(SMILING)

I love you.

JOHN

I love you, too.

(THEN)

And, I want you to know that... I'm

probably never gonna be any more than a

guy who rents cars, but... I don't care.

You're the only thing that matters in my

life.

TED (O.S.)

AY--

JOHN

You and Ted.

TED (O.S.)

Yes!

JOHN

And after last night, I... I don't ever

want to lose anyone who matters to me

ever again. I'm not gonna wait any

longer for my life to start. Lori...

will you marry me?

LORI

(beat, she smiles)

That's all I ever wanted.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

ever after, having discovered at last

other. John and Lori were married in a

very special Justice of the Peace.
